    "main_text": "Cognition\n4. Cognition\n\nEpistemology is another subject in which Gregory\u2019s thought has\nreceived much attention (e.g. Elie 1937; Dal Pra 1956; G\u00e1l\n1977; Eckermann 1978; V. Wendland\u2019s chapter in Oberman 1981,\n242\u2013300; Tachau 1988, 358\u201371; Bermon 2007; Mandrella 2016;\nGirard 2017). Gregory maintains a non-realist position that universals\nare formed by the soul and only after the mind has previous\napprehensions of singular things. Thus sensory experience plays a\nmajor role in intellectual cognition. For simple cognition Gregory\nadopts the common terminology of the dichotomy between intuitive and\nabstractive cognition, although the difference between the two is\nbased on the objects rather than the modes of cognition. For Gregory,\nintuitive cognition terminates immediately at the extramental object,\nbut abstractive terminates at the object\u2019s species in the soul.\nThe fact that Gregory made room for such species in his theory of\ncognition has not gone unnoticed (Corvino 1978; Spruit 2013, 309\u2013313;\nMandrella 2016, 220\u2013223). It has been described as the only difference\nbetween Ockham and Rimini in the epistemology of simple cognition\n(Mandrella 2016, 223). Still, Gregory\u2019s use of species\nconditions his take on universal concepts to such an extent that he\nembraces a view Ockham explicitly rejected as especially irrational,\nnamely the view that universal concepts are qualities really distinct\nfrom mental acts and that remain in the soul independently of whether\na mental act is directed at them or not (Girard 2017, 263).\n\nInspired by some of Ockham\u2019s successors, Gregory argues against\nthe Venerable Inceptor\u2019s claim that via intuitive cognition one\ncould determine whether a thing does exist or not (Tachau 1988, 363).\nIn agreement with Auriol against most contemporaries, however, Gregory\nalso holds that one can have an intuitive cognition of an object that\ndoes not exist, as for example when we see a \u201cbroken\u201d\npencil in a glass of water, when there is only an unbroken pencil in\nreality. But Auriol is wrong in claiming that this is an instance of\nan intuitive cognition of something absent (Tachau 1988, 361), because\nfor Gregory the cognition is really caused by the species of some\npresent object, although perhaps not the object that the mind thinks\nit is. Therefore Gregory does not adopt Auriol\u2019s definition of\nintuitive cognition as the cognition when the soul merely thinks that\nthe object is present. In any case the dichotomy is different for\nGregory because he maintains that abstractive cognition is also\nsomewhat intuitive, since the species of the object is known\nimmediately and therefore intuitively.\n\nWhen it comes to the object of complex cognition, or scientific\nknowledge, Gregory\u2019s inspiration was Adam Wodeham, who built on\nsome of Walter Chatton\u2019s ideas in developing the complexe\nsignificabile. Ockham held that the object of scientific\nknowledge is the conclusion of a syllogism, and Gregory rejects this.\nChatton\u2019s alternative was that scientific knowledge has as its\nobject things outside the mind. Gregory also denies this, because\n\nif this were the case, many sciences would be about contingent things\nthat could be different than they are, whereas for strict science the\nobject must be eternal and necessary. Every being, however, besides\nGod is contingent and not necessary. If things outside the mind were\nthe objects of the sciences, then many sciences, physical and\ngeometrical, and many others, would be about things other than God,\nand therefore about contingent things (Rimini 1979, 6; Brown 1998a,\n171).\n\n\nOne can see here how Gregory\u2019s stress on the overarching\ncontingency of creation connects with his epistemology.\n\nGregory chooses as the object of scientific knowledge the alternative\noffered by Adam Wodeham. Chatton\u2019s notion of \u201cthing\u201d\nin scientific knowledge was the state of affairs signified by both the\nnegative and the affirmative proposition. For example, \u201cSocrates\nis sitting\u201d and \u201cSocrates is not sitting\u201d signify\nfor Chatton the same thing, not Socrates, not sitting, and not the\npropositions, but somehow the whole Socrates\u2019s-being-seated.\nAlthough Chatton had his reasons for his theory, Wodeham modified it\nin a useful way, differentiating between positive and negative states\nof affairs. Thus for Wodeham, each proposition has its own total\nsignificate that is only complexly signifiable (complexe\nsignificabile), so that Socrates\u2019s-being-seated and\nSocrates\u2019s-not-being-seated are two different things, the\nobjects of scientific knowledge.\n\nGregory adopted Wodeham\u2019s theory and tailored it where necessary\nto his own thought. The complexe significabile, once thought\nto be Gregory\u2019s invention, is neither the proposition itself,\nnor individual things in the world, nor the arrangement of things in\nthe world. The exact status of Gregory\u2019s complexe\nsignificabile has been much discussed. In a nutshell, there are\nthree main interpretations. The first one builds on Gregory\u2019s\nclaim that the complexe significabile is nothing\n(nihil), and thus holds that Gregory does not defend logical\nrealism (Biard 1989, 183, Libera 2002, 217; Bermon 2007,\n166\u2013167). The second interpretation builds on Gregory\u2019s\nclaim that there are senses of \u201csomething\u201d\n(aliquid), \u201cthing\u201d (res) and\n\u201cbeing\u201d (ens) that can apply to the complexe\nsignificabile, and insists that the\ncomplexe significabile must be something mind-independent\nbecause of this, although it is not an entity (Elie 1936, 28, 174;\nNuchelmans 1973, 73). The third interpretation concludes from the fact\nthat the complexe significabile is said to be something but\nnot an entity to the fact that the complexe significabile\nmust be mind-dependent or in the mind (Trapp 1977, 58; Mandrella 2016,\n208, as a legitimate hypothesis). Another point of debate concerns how\none should evaluate Gregory\u2019s take on Wodeham\u2019s ideas.\nThat debate opposes those who consider Gregory\u2019s developments as\na clearer elaboration of the concept (Bermon 2007, 169, 173), and\nthose who believe Gregory blurred the clear picture Wodeham had given,\nthus making the doctrine of the complexe significabile an\neasy target (G\u00e0l 1977, 70; Nuchelmans 1980, 185\u2013186; Zupko\n1994\u20131997, 218).\n\nGregory famously listed three ways in which some complexe\nsignificabile could be said to be true: first, because a\nproposition signifying it would be true; second, with reference to the\nuncreated truth; third, because it is the case (i.e. it obtains).\nThese descriptions have sometimes been read as competing ones (Elie\n1936, 175). If there is a general agreement that the first way must be\nleft aside as too weak, since it makes the truth of the complexe\nsignificabilia depend on enunciations, it has been claimed that\nthe second and third ways are compatible with each other (Libera 2002,\n253; Conti 2004, 482\u2013483) and even complementary (Bermon 2007,\n161\u2013162).\n\nIt is also known that Gregory differed from Wodeham in the way he\nthought about \u201cassenting to\u201d and \u201cdissenting\nfrom\u201d such complexe significabilia, an issue which had\noccupied Chatton at length. Wodeham thought of assent pretty much as\nan act of the will (Bermon 2007, 319), that can contingently be added\nover and above a formed proposition. Gregory distinguishes two kinds\nof mental propositions: mental propositions that are not expressed in\na given language, and mental propositions that are expressed in a\ngiven language and that derive from the first kind. For Gregory,\nWodeham\u2019s claim is true only of linguistic mental propositions\n(Bermon 2007, 343\u2013344). For non-linguistic mental propositions,\nit is impossible to dissociate the formation and the acts of assent or\ndissent. Formation and assent are associated in such a way that\nGregory can claim that assent is a mental utterance (Bermon 2007,\n331).\n\nGregory applied the notion to a host of philosophical problems, such\nas future contingents, and through him the complexe\nsignificabile became the common intellectual property of\ncontinental thinkers, and parallel notions are found in many important\nlater intellectuals. More particularly, recent studies have focused on\nthe reception of Gregory\u2019s doctrine in Pierre Ceffons (Nannini\n2015; Corbini 2020).\n\nApart from complexe significabilia, another point of contact\nbetween Wodeham and Gregory in connection with complex cognition is\nthe debate on the capacity that non-human animals have to make a\njudgement (i.e. Reina 1986; Perler 2006, 89\u201394; Oelze 2018,\n123\u2013129).  Gregory claims that we need to ascribe sensory\njudgments to non-human animals in order to account for their\nbehaviour, especially for the different responses a same individual\ncan exhibit to a same stimulus (Oelze 2018, 126\u2013127).\n\nWith regard to the mental proposition, although Gregory defends that\nthe intellect can indeed have simultaneous acts (Friedman 2009, 114;\nDubouclez 2014, 342\u2013347), nevertheless he holds, as Durand of\nSaint-Pour\u00e7ain did, that the mental proposition must consist of\na single act (Friedman 2009, 115).\n",
