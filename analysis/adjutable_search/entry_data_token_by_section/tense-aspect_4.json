    "main_text": "Lexical and Grammatical Aspect\n5. Lexical and Grammatical Aspect\n\nLinguists distinguish four or five lexical aspectual classes or\nAktionsarten. The following four were introduced by the\nphilosopher Zeno Vendler (1967: chapter four) on the basis of earlier\nwork by philosophers such as Kenny, Ryle and Aristotle (see also the\n entry on events). For a formal\ndefinition of Aktionsart the reader is referred to van\nLambalgen and Hamm (2005: 85 ff). \n\nTable 3.\n\nStates\nActivities\nAccomplishments\nAchievements \n\nknow \nrun \ncross the street \nrecognize  \n\nbe beautiful\nswim \ndraw a circle \nreach  \n\nbelieve \nwalk \npaint a picture \nfind \n\n\nIn addition, linguists often assume that verbs like flash,\nspot and blink form an extra class\u2014the class\nof semelfactives or points (see Smith 1991). \n\nA useful notion for distinguishing Aktionarten is the\nevent nucleus introduced by Moens and Steedman (1988). The\nevent nucleus is constructed from a preparatory phase, a culminating\nevent and a consequent phase. Activities only refer to the preparatory\nphase, states only to the consequent phase, achievements to the\nculminating event and to the consequent phase and finally\naccomplishments to all three parts of the event nucleus. \n\n\n\n\n\nVendler proposed several linguistic tests for distinguishing these\nverb classes. We will present only the most important ones here; for a\nmuch more comprehensive list the reader is referred to Dowty (1979: 60).\nThe first test separates non-statives from statives. Only non-statives\noccur in the progressive. \n9.\n\n(a)\n\n*Sam is knowing the answer.\n      \n\n\n(b)\n\nSam is running.\n      \n\n\n(c)\n\n\nSam is writing a letter.\n      \n\n\nAccomplishment verbs prefer \\(in\\)-adverbials as temporal\nmodifiers, whereas activity verbs allow only\nfor-adverbials.\n10.\n\n(a)\n\n ?Sam wrote a letter for an hour.\n      \n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n Sam wrote a letter in an hour.\n      \n\n\n(c)\n\n Sam swam for an hour.\n      \n\n\n(d)\n\n *Sam swam in an hour.\n      \n\n\nAchievement verbs are usually infelicitous with\n\nfor-adverbials but allow the combination with\n\\(in\\)-adverbials. \n11.\n\n(a)\n\nSam reached the summit in five hours.\n      \n\n\n(b)\n\n*Sam reached the summit for five hours.\n      \n\n\nThe last test we mention here concerns the different entailment\npatterns of activities and accomplishments in the progressive.\nActivities in the past progressive entail their past reading but\naccomplishments in the past progressive don\u2019t. \n12.\n\n(a)\n\nSam was pushing a cart. \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \n      \n\n\n(b)\n\nSam pushed a cart.\n      \n\n13.\n\n(a)\n\nSam was building a house. \\(\\not\\Rightarrow\\) \n      \n\n\n(b)\n\n\nSam built a house.\n      \n\n\nThis is an instance of the famous imperfective paradox. Of course,\ntaken literally this is not a paradox. Nevertheless the entailment\npatterns (12) and (13) pose a significant problem for any formal\ntheory of tense and aspect. For instance, the first formal proposal\nfor truth conditions of sentences in the past progressive stated that\na sentence S in the past progressive is true if and only if there\nexists an open interval before the speech time at which the sentence\nwithout the progressive is true. According to definition 1.4 this\nimmediately validates pattern (12) but without qualifications this\ntruth definition does not account for pattern (13). Sections\n 6\n and\n 7\ncontain extensive discussion of the imperfective paradox. \n\nVendler thought of the Aktionarten as lexical properties of\nverbs. That this position is dubious was pointed out by many\nlinguists, in particular by Dowty (1979) and Verkuyl (1993). For a\nsimple case, consider the verb drink. If we assume that being\nan activity is a lexical property of this verb, then surely by\ncombining it with the noun wine this property is preserved\nfor the complex phrase drink wine. However, if we combine the\nverb drink with the noun phrase a bottle of wine we\nturn an activity into an accomplishment. The converse problem arises\nif we assume that being an accomplishment is a lexical property of\n\ndrink. This phenomenon of aspectual reinterpretation was\ndubbed coercion in Moens and Steedman (1988). In\n Section 6.1 \nwe will sketch a systematic solution for these types of coercion\n in mereological semantics (Krifka 1989, 1992). \n\nAktionsart is not even definitely fixed at the VP-level. The\nverb arrive in \n\n\n14.\n\n(a)\nChapman arrived.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n*Chapman arrived all night.\n\n\nis an achievement, as demonstrated by the ungrammaticality of (14-b).\nBut if we choose a bare plural as subject it is turned into an\nactivity and sentence (15) is grammatical. \n15.\n\nVisitors arrived all night.\n    \n\nTherefore a final decision about aspectual class cannot be reached\nbelow the sentence level. Steedman\u2019s famous sentence (16) \n16.\n\n\nIt took me two years to play the \u201cMinute Waltz\u201d in\nless than sixty seconds for one hour without stopping.\n    \n\nshows that coercion can be iterated and that aspectual class can\nswitch back and forth in this iteration process. We close this section\nwith two further examples of aspectual coercion. In the first one a\nstative verb is transformed into an activity.\n\nThe verb resemble is a stative verb and therefore (17a) is\nunacceptable but (17b) is fine. \n17.\n\n(a)\n\n*She is resembling her mother. \n      \n\n\n(b)\n\nShe resembles her mother.\n      \n\n\nHowever, if we add more and more every day to (17a) thus\nforming \n18.\n\nShe is resembling her mother more and more every day.\n    \n\n\nwe get an acceptable result. This is due to the phrase more and\nmore every day which coerces a state into an activity. Our last\nexample is about temporal modification with for-adverbials.\nAs pointed out above accomplishments are usually rather bad with\nfor-adverbials. They require \\(in\\)-adverbials. But\nconsider sentence (19) from van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005). \n19.\n\nPollini played Opus 111 for two weeks.\n    \n\nThis sentence seems to be fine. However it is not interpreted as an\naccomplishment any more but is reinterpreted as an iterated activity.\nTo get this reading, a lot of non-linguistic knowledge is required.\nFirst, one has to guess that Opus 111 refers to Beethoven\u2019s last piano\nsonata and moreover one has to be aware that this piece lasts about 25\nminutes. Under these assumptions, sentence (19) says that Pollini\nplayed Opus 111 repeatedly within a time span of two weeks. Formal\naccounts of coercion phenomena are contained in Egg (2005), van\nLambalgen and Hamm (2005) and Steedman (1997) among others. The reader\nis also advised to consult Steedman\u2019s updated manuscript, The\nProductions of Time (see the Other Internet Resources).\nProcessing studies of coercion are reviewed in Bott (2010); see also\n Section 8.\n\n",
