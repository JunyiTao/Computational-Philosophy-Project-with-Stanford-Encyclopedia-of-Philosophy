    "main_text": "Origins and Meaning of the Concept of Authenticity || Sincerity and Authenticity\n1.1 Sincerity and Authenticity\n\nA number of significant cultural changes in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries led to the emergence of a new ideal in the\nWestern world (Trilling 1972). During this period, human beings came\nto be thought of more as individuals than as placeholders in systems\nof social relations. This emphasis on the importance of the individual\nis seen in the prevalence of autobiographies and self-portraits, where\nthe individual becomes the centre of attention not because of\nextraordinary feats or access to special knowledge, but because he or\nshe is an individual.\n\nIn the same period, society comes to be seen not as an organic whole\nof interacting components, but as an aggregate of individual human\nbeings, a social system with a life of its own, which presents itself\nto the individual as not itself quite human but rather as artificial,\nthe result of a \u201csocial contract\u201d. Being human is\nunderstood as being best achieved through being unique and\ndistinctive, even when these collide with certain social norms. At the\nsame time, there is an increasing awareness of what Charles Taylor\n(1989) calls \u201cinwardness\u201d or \u201cinternal space\u201d.\nThe result is a distinction between one\u2019s private and unique\nindividuality, and one\u2019s public self (Taylor 1991; Trilling\n1972).\n\nWith these social changes there is a sharp shift in the conceptions of\napprobation and disapproval that are commonly used in judging others\nand oneself. For instance, concepts like sincerity and honor become\nobsolescent (Berger 1970). In earlier times, a sincere person was seen\nas someone who honestly attempts to neither violate the expectations\nthat follow from the position he holds in society, nor to strive to\nappear otherwise than he ought to. However, by the time of Hegel, the\nideal of sincerity had lost its normative appeal. Hegel polemically\nrefers to sincerity as \u201cthe heroism of dumb service\u201d\n(Hegel 2002 [1807]: 515) and launches an attack on the bourgeois\n\u201chonest man,\u201d who passively internalizes a particular\nconventional social ethos. In the condition of sincerity, the\nindividual is uncritically obedient to the power of society\u2014a\nconformity that for Hegel leads to subjugation and a deterioration of\nthe individual (Hegel 2002 [1807]; Golomb 1995: 9; Trilling 1972). For\nHegel, in the progress of \u201cspirit\u201d, the individual\nconsciousness will eventually move from this condition of sincerity to\na condition of baseness, in which the individual becomes antagonistic\nto external societal powers and achieves a measure of autonomy. Hegel\nshows this clearly in a comment on Diderot\u2019s Rameau\u2019s\nNephew, a story in which the narrator (supposedly Diderot\nhimself) is portrayed as the reasonable, sincere man who respects the\nprevailing order and who has achieved bourgeois respectability. In\ncontrast, the nephew is full of contempt for the society in which he\nfigures as a worthless person. However, he is in opposition to\nhimself, because he still aspires to a better standing in a society,\nwhich he believes has nothing but emptiness to offer (Despland 1975:\n360; Golomb 1995: 13\u201315). For Hegel, the narrator is an example\nof the sincere, honest soul, while the nephew figures as the\n\u201cdisintegrated,\u201d alienated consciousness. The nephew is\nclearly alienated, but for Hegel this alienation is a step in the\nprogression towards autonomous existence (Williams 2002: 190).\n\nIn the midst of this conceptual change, the term\n\u2018authenticity\u2019 becomes applicable in demarcating a\nsomewhat new set of virtues. The older concept of sincerity, referring\nto being truthful in order to be honest in one\u2019s dealings with\nothers, comes to be replaced by a relatively new concept of\nauthenticity, understood as being true to oneself for one\u2019s own\nbenefit. Earlier, the moral advice to be authentic recommended that\none should be true to oneself in order thereby to be true to\nothers. Thus, being true to oneself is seen as a means to the\nend of successful social relations. In contrast, in our contemporary\nthinking, authenticity as a virtue term is seen as referring to a way\nof acting that is choiceworthy in itself (Ferrara 1993; Varga 2011a;\nVarga 2011b).\n",
