    "main_text": "Toward a Trans/Feminism || A Transfeminist Manifesto\n10.1 A Transfeminist Manifesto\n\n\nEmi Koyama defines transfeminism as \u201cprimarily a movement by and\nfor trans women who view their liberation to be intrinsically linked\nto the liberation of all women and beyond\u201d (2003, 244).  For\nKoyama, transfeminism \u201cstands up for trans and non-trans women\nalike, and asks non-trans women to stand up for trans-women in\nreturn\u201d, thereby embracing feminist coalition politics (ibid.).\nSome of the issues of transfeminist concern, for Koyama, include body\nimage, violence against women, and health and reproductive choice.\n\n\nKoyama deepens the discussion of the tensions, identified by Heyes,\nbetween freedom of gender expression (on the one hand) and concerns\nabout the political implications of gender understood as relational\n(on the other). While Koyama calls trans women to avoid the uptake of\nsexist forms of gender as well as refusing any traditional appeal to\nan essentializing gender identity, she also recognizes that trans\nwomen can find themselves in situations in which uptake of traditional\nforms of gender are necessary to secure access to medical\ntechnologies, legitimation as \u201creal women\u201d, and avoidance\nof transphobic violence through passing (as non-trans) (2003). She\nraises worries about the purist demand that a trans woman\neradicate all gender stereotypes in a society in which such\nstereotypes pervade. She insists instead on the priority of larger\nscale coalitional politics, leaving individual women to make their own\npersonal decisions about how to negotiate gender, free of judgments\nabout who does and does not count as a feminist (2003).\n\n\nKoyama also takes up the issues of trans exclusion in the\n\u201cwomyn-born womyn\u201d policy of the Michigan Womyn's Music\nFestival. Koyama criticizes the efforts of some post-operative trans\nwomen to accept a \u201ccompromise\u201d policy which would have\nadmitted only post-operative trans women. Such a policy, argues\nKoyama, would unfairly advantage those trans women with greater\neconomic resources, and is consequently both classist and racist\n(2006, 700). Koyama also argues that even if it is true that non-trans\nwomen require their own space, this does not preclude the admission of\ntrans women into the festival, since while women of color have special\nexclusionary space on the land, this does not require that white women\ncannot enter the festival at all (701). Moreover, Koyama points out,\nsuch special space for women of color does not exclude those women of\ncolor who can pass as white (and thereby receive certain privileges)\n(701). Indeed, Koyama argues, the exclusion of trans women is\ninherently racist insofar as it is uses differences in experience to\nrule out trans women, a policy which can only make sense if it is\npresupposed that feminist solidarity requires a monolithically shared\nexperience (704).\n",
