    "main_text": "Conclusion\n12. Suggested Reading\n\nThe critical article by Earman and Roberts (1999) provides an\nexcellent introduction to the contemporary debate, because it\nreconstructs the most important theories of cp-laws and also points\nout the problems of these approaches. The volumes by Earman et\nal. (2002) and Reutlinger and Unterhuber (2014) contain a\nrepresentative collection of contemporary essays on the problem of\ncp-laws.\n\nPersky (1990), Blaug (1996) and Kaufer (1997) are accessible surveys\nof the history of cp-clauses and cp-laws. Notice that these articles\nfocus on economics and the social sciences. For a systematic\ndiscussion of laws in the social sciences, the debate between Kincaid\n(2004) and Roberts (2004) on whether there are laws in the social\nsciences is very instructive.\n\nThe important distinctions between (a) comparative and exclusive and\n(b) indefinite and definite cp-laws are established and argued for in\nSchurz (2002).\n\nThe dilemma of triviality or falsity is discussed in Lange (1993),\nwhich is also a helpful survey of the debate until 1993.\n\nConcerning completer accounts, Fodor (1991), Hausman (1992: chapter 8)\nand Pietroski and Rey (1995) are central papers. These accounts are\ncriticized by Earman and Roberts (1999), Schurz (2001a) and Woodward\n(2002). A more recent defense of completer accounts is Strevens\n(2012).\n\nConcerning stability accounts, Marc Lange develops his version in\nbook-length (see his 2000 and 2009a, although the focus of the latter\nis not on cp-laws). Lange (2002) is a very accessible paper on his\nview of cp-laws. Invariance accounts are best introduced in two joint\npapers by James Woodward and Christopher Hitchcock (see their EG1, EG2) and in Woodward\u2019s book Making Things Happen (2003:\nchapter 6). Hall (2007) provides an insightful discussion of Woodward\n& Hitchcock\u2019s invariance account. \n\nFor dispositionalist approaches to cp-laws, Cartwright (1989) is a\nmodern classic (cf. her recent 2002, and Elgin and Sober 2002 for a\ncritique). Smith (2002), Mumford (2004), Bird (2005, 2007) and\nH\u00fcttemann (2007, 2014) develop different more recent\ndispositional accounts of cp-laws.\n\nConcerning normality approaches, Schurz (2001b, 2002) argues for a\nnormic laws approach. Spohn (2002) and Spohn (2012, chapter 13) are\ngood introductions to the normal conditions approach. See also Glymour\n(2002) for a formal approach to cp-laws.\n\nHumean better best system accounts of cp-laws are presented in Cohen\nand Callender (2009, 2010), Schrenk (2007a, 2014), and Unterhuber\n(2014). Wheeler (2018: chapter 3.2) gives an accessible brief\nexposition of various versions; and Reutlinger (2009) and Backmann and\nReutlinger (2014) provide a critical discussion. \n\nThere are also various approaches in the current debate that cannot\neasily be classified: Mitchell (1997, 2002a, b; 2008, 2009), Sober\n1997, Steel (2007, chapter 6) and Reiss (2008) attempt to explicate a\ntheory of laws that fits scientific practice in biology, the social\nsciences and generalization describing complex systems. Further,\nMitchell (2000), Craver (2007), Tobin (2005) and Reutlinger (2011)\ndistinguish various dimensions of the non-universality of (cp-)laws in\norder to argue for an explication of laws in the special sciences.\nKarbasizadeh (2008) links the debates on cp-laws and natural kinds.\nLadyman and Ross (2007, chapters 4 and 5), Kincaid (2008), Ross\n(2008), and Ladyman (2008) argue for ontic structural realism as a\nmetaphysics of generalizations in the social sciences (and for the\nspecial sciences in general). Finally, Maudlin (2007, chapter 5)\nadvocates an explication of laws in the special sciences that is based\non the notion of quasi-Newtonian laws.\n",
