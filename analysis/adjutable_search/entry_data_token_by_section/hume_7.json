    "main_text": "Causation\n5. Causation\n\nThe medieval synthesis Thomas Aquinas (1224\u201374) forged between\nChristian theology and Aristotle\u2019s science and metaphysics set\nthe terms for the early modern causation debate. Aristotle\n(384\u2013322 BCE) drew an absolute categorical distinction between\nscientific knowledge (scientia) and belief (opinio).\nScientific knowledge was knowledge of causes and scientific\nexplanation consisted in demonstration\u2014proving the\nnecessary connection between a cause and its effect from\nintuitively obvious premises independently of experience.\n\nModern philosophers thought of themselves as scientific\nrevolutionaries because they rejected Aristotle\u2019s account of\ncausation. Even so, they accepted his distinction between knowledge\nand belief, and regarded causal inference as an exercise of reason,\nwhich aimed at demonstrating the necessary connection between cause\nand effect. Malebranche (1638\u20131715), and others following\nDescartes (1596\u20131650), were optimistic about the possibility of\ndemonstrative scientific knowledge, while those in the British\nexperimental tradition were more pessimistic. Locke was sufficiently\nsceptical about what knowledge we can attain that he constructed one\nof the first accounts of probable inference to show that belief can\nmeet standards of rationality that make experimental natural\nphilosophy intellectually respectable.\n\nWhen Hume enters the debate, he translates the traditional distinction\nbetween knowledge and belief into his own terms, dividing \u201call\nthe objects of human reason or enquiry\u201d into two exclusive and\nexhaustive categories: relations of ideas and matters of\nfact.\n\nPropositions concerning relations of ideas are intuitively or\ndemonstratively certain. They are known a\npriori\u2014discoverable independently of experience by\n\u201cthe mere operation of thought\u201d, so their truth\ndoesn\u2019t depend on anything actually existing (EHU 4.1.1/25).\nThat the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle sum to 180\ndegrees is true whether or not there are any Euclidean triangles\nto be found in nature. Denying that proposition is a contradiction,\njust as it is contradictory to say that 8\u00d77=57.\n\nIn sharp contrast, the truth of propositions concerning matters of\nfact depends on the way the world is. Their contraries are always\npossible, their denials never imply contradictions, and they\ncan\u2019t be established by demonstration. Asserting that Miami\nis north of Boston is false, but not contradictory. We can\nunderstand what someone who asserts this is saying, even if we are\npuzzled about how he could have the facts so wrong.\n\nThe distinction between relations of ideas and matters of\nfact is often called \u201cHume\u2019s Fork\u201d, generally\nwith the negative implication that Hume may be illicitly ruling out\nmeaningful propositions that don\u2019t fit into these two categories\nor fit into both of them. To defuse this objection, however, it is\nimportant to bear in mind that Hume\u2019s categories are his\ntranslations of a traditional absolute categorical classificatory\ndistinction, which all his contemporaries and immediate predecessors\naccepted.\n\nHume\u2019s method dictates his strategy in the causation debate. In\nthe critical phase, he argues that his predecessors were\nwrong: our causal inferences aren\u2019t determined by \u201creason\nor any other operation of the understanding\u201d (EHU 5.1.2/41). In\nthe constructive phase, he supplies an alternative: the\nassociative principles are their basis.\n\nHume\u2019s contributions to the critical phase of the\ncausation debate are contained in Treatise 1.3.6 and Section\n4 of the first Enquiry, appropriately titled \u201cSceptical\ndoubts concerning the operations of the understanding\u201d. The\nconstructive phase in his Enquiry account is the\nfollowing section, also appropriately titled \u201cSceptical solution\nof these doubts\u201d, while the corresponding sections of the\nTreatise stretch from 1.3.7 through 1.3.10.\n",
