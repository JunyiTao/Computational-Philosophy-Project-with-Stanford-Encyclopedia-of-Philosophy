    "main_text": "Continental philosophy of history\n2. Continental philosophy of history\n\nThe topic of history has been treated frequently in modern European\nphilosophy. A long, largely German, tradition of thought looks at\nhistory as a total and comprehensible process of events, structures,\nand processes, for which the philosophy of history can serve as an\ninterpretive tool. This approach, speculative and meta-historical,\naims to discern large, embracing patterns and directions in the\nunfolding of human history, persistent notwithstanding the erratic\nback-and-forth of particular historical developments. Modern\nphilosophers raising this set of questions about the large direction\nand meaning of history include Vico, Herder, and Hegel. A somewhat\ndifferent line of thought in the continental tradition that has been\nvery relevant to the philosophy of history is the hermeneutic\ntradition of the human sciences. Through their emphasis on the\n\u201chermeneutic circle\u201d through which humans undertake to\nunderstand the meanings created by other humans\u2014in texts,\nsymbols, and actions\u2014hermeneutic philosophers such as\nSchleiermacher (1838), Dilthey (1860\u20131903), and Ricoeur\n(1984-1988, 2000) offer philosophical arguments for emphasizing the\nimportance of narrative interpretation within our understanding of\nhistory. Understanding history means providing a narrative that makes\nsense of it from beginning to end.\n",
