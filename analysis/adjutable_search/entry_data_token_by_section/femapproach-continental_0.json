Characteristics of Continental Feminism\n\nContinental feminists share with other Continental thinkers an\ninterest in close reading that uses careful exegesis to unpack the\ndeep meanings of texts through attention to their linguistic and\nhistorical specificity. However, to utilize a philosophical tradition\nthat has largely presumed rather than explored the impacts of sex and\ngender on material life, continental feminists often read irreverently\nto focus on concerns that traditional philosophy might push to the\nside. While all feminist theorizing deals with questions of power,\nsubjectivity, and culture, Continental feminist approaches to these\nissues are often critical in the sense that they explore how\nexternal power dynamics affect the constitution of inner experiences,\nand in turn how embodied and subjective re-articulations of power can\nand should transform the world in the pursuit of justice. This\nfrequently involves taking lived experience as a crucial component of\ncritical philosophy; as Gail Weiss puts it,\n\n\nonly by interrogating the \u201cordinary\u201d dimensions of\nexperience is it possible to arrive at an understanding of the dynamic\nforces that give meaning to individual lives and that are both the\nobstacle and the vehicle to achieving lasting social change. (Weiss\n2008: 5)\n\n\nTo present a broad sketch of characteristics of continental feminism\nthroughout its history, this section focuses on methods that\nContinental feminists use to engage embodied experience in their\nprojects. The gendered critique of the traditional Western\nphilosophical tendency to dichotomize the body that feels and the mind\nthat thinks is an ongoing theme in continental feminism (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on the body).\n The account presented here is not at all complete, as the specific\naims and methods of such feminist projects differ widely, most\nimportantly in terms of how an analysis of sex and gender is impacted\nby other aspects of embodied experience such as race, sexuality, and\nability. This section first addresses some ways that continental\nfeminists trouble a mind-body distinction by engaging affect and\nemotion in their work. Next, it explores two examples of how\ncontinental traditions, psychoanalysis and phenomenology, are made\ninto critical resources in Continental feminist projects. Finally, it\npresents work that engages an ongoing critique of culture and everyday\nexperience as an important aspect of feminist theorizing.\n\nMany Continental feminists focus on the overlaying of mental and\nphysical experience via the concepts of affect, emotion, and feeling.\nAffect is described by Teresa Brennan as \u201cthe physiological\nshift accompanying a judgment\u201d (Brennan 2004: 5). The\n\u201ctransmission of affect\u201d describes the way that one can\ncatch the mood of another; this experience is \u201csocial in origin\nbut biological and physical in effect\u201d (Brennan 2004: 3).\nBrennan describes transmission as when the \u201cemotions or\naffects of one person, and the enhancing or depressing energies these\naffects entail\u201d pass from one person to another (Brennan 2004:\n3). Affect is thus one way to describe how social experience impacts\nthe corporeal life of subjects through the transference of energy. In\nBrennan\u2019s case, affective states are directional; they\nare not neutral but push or press on subjects. At the same time, terms\nlike affect and feeling might be distinguished based on the extent to\nwhich one considers affect to be already coded with or influenced by\nsocial significance for a subject (see Ahmed 2010: 230\u2013231,\nSeigworth & Gregg 2010, esp. 5\u20138).\n\nContinental feminist projects on emotion often analyze historically\ncontextualized experiences. Ann Cvetkovich engages with trauma in a\nway that\n\n\nfocuses on the everyday and the insidious\u2026and situates it in a\nsocial and cultural frame rather than a medical one. (Cvetkovich 2007:\n464)\n\n\nShe then presents a political account of depression that\ndepathologizes such negatively-connotated emotional experiences so\nthat they can become more visible in public and thus create a\npotential foundation for community (Cvetkovich 2007: 460). In The\nCultural Politics of Emotion, Sara Ahmed argues that emotion is\ngenerated when meaning is produced across social-political\ninteraction; these feelings create the boundaries of affinity groups\nand impact self-understanding. In this analysis, emotions help\nconstitute what a person understands as their objective condition, and\nthus\n\n\nemotions are not \u201cin\u201d either the individual or the social,\nbut produce the very surfaces and boundaries that allow all kinds of\nobjects to be delineated. (Ahmed 2004 [2014: 10])\n\n\nBecause feeling is often ambivalent and multi-faceted, rather than in\nspite of this complexity, social critics who attend to how affects are\nemployed and manipulated in both textual and social-political\nargumentation can produce readings that trouble an easy dichotomy\nbetween what is a \u201cgood\u201d and what a \u201cbad\u201d\nexperience.\n\nPsychoanalytically-informed projects use concepts such as trauma,\nmourning, melancholia, and abjection to analyze embodied experience\n(Irigaray 1974 [1985]; Spillers 1996; Butler 1997; Felman 2002; Oliver\n2004; entry on\n psychoanalytic feminism).\n They frequently engage aesthetics as an aspect of social critique\n(Chanter 2008; Kristeva 1980 [1982]; Miller 2014). This allows a\nsymptomatic reading of feeling to be interpreted back against the\nsocial order, as is seen in Judith Butler\u2019s Frames of\nWar. In this text, Butler analyzes what makes a life grievable\nand argues that the questions of who appears as a human, whose life\nshould be protected, and who does not are all figured in advance of\nany particular political decision through a pre-reflexive manipulation\nof affect (Butler 2009 [2016: 64]). Supplementing democratic theory\nwith Continental feminist interpretations, No\u00eblle McAfee deploys\nKristeva and the resources in her thought, as well as psychoanalysis,\nspecifically on the issues of affect and the notion of the\n\u201cpolitical unconscious\u201d (McAfee 2000 and 2008).\n\nCritical phenomenologists draw on the methods of phenomenology to\ndemonstrate \u201cthe multiple ways in which power moves through our\nbodies and our lives\u201d (Introduction, Weiss, Murphy, &\nSalamon 2020: xiv). Lisa Guenther understands critical phenomenology\nas both a way of doing philosophy and a way of approaching political\nactivism (Guenther 2020: 15). Most characteristically, Guenther argues\nthat critical phenomenology employs reworked versions of\n\n\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s concept of the body schema to account for\ngendered and sexual schemas (Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Marion Young,\nTalia Mae Bettcher, Gayle Salamon), racialized schemas (Frantz Fanon,\nLewis Gordon, Sara Ahmed, George Yancy, Alia Al-Saji), disability\nschemas (Kay Toombs, Lisa Diedrich, Havi Carel), and other aspects of\nlived experience. (Guenther 2020: 13\u201314)\n\n\nA recent volume edited by Gail Weiss, Ann V, Murphy, and Gayle\nSalamon, entitled 50 Concepts for a Critical* Phenomenology\n(2020), shows that many of the central concepts of critical\nphenomenology intersect with Continental feminism.\n\nFinally, considering the social and political import of inner states\nand the centering of quotidian experiences of power enable Continental\nfeminists to explore culture as it develops. For instance, Shannon\nSullivan\u2019s Good White People: The Problem with Middle-Class\nAnti-Racism focuses on \u201cthe personal side of whiteness and\nwhite privilege\u201d with attention to the embodied experience of\nrace (S. Sullivan 2014: 19) to critique the ways through which white\nliberals set themselves up as altruistic, \u201cgood\u201d white\npeople through, e.g., hypocritical modes of tolerance that maintain\nwhite domination (S. Sullivan 2014: 4). Robin James\u2019\nResilience & Melancholy explores pop music as a way to\nanalyze the impact of neoliberal biopolitics; she combines music\ntheory with psychoanalytic and Foucauldian philosophies to critique\ncomplicity with multi-racial white supremacist patriarchy and argues\nthat music, e.g., Rihanna\u2019s, offer strategies for countering\nthis oppressive power (R. James 2015). In Irony in the Age of\nEmpire: Comic Perspectives on Philosophy and Freedom, Cynthia\nWillett engages film and stand-up comedy to articulate a libidinal\nunderstanding of freedom that can counter the liberal paradigms of\nindividuality with a sense of freedom defined \u201cin terms of\nequality and solidarity\u201d (Willett 2008: 14). Erin Tarver\nanalyzes practices of sports fans, with particular attention to\nfootball, baseball, and basketball fans in the American South, to\nbetter understand how individual and group identities are maintained\nto \u201c\u2026shore up, reproduce, and very occasionally, subvert\nracial, sexual and gender hierarchies\u201d (Tarver 2017: 3). This\nwork is often interdisciplinary, and some of these projects work at\nthe intersection between continental and pragmatist feminisms (see\nentry on\n intersections between pragmatist and continental feminism).\n\nSimultaneously reading carefully and irreverently, continental\nfeminists deepen the philosophical account of experience by\nintegrating historically contextualized feeling into their projects,\nusing and transmuting philosophical traditions and traditional\nfigures, and interrogating everyday experiences in their embodied and\ncultural specificity. This work insists that meaning and social order\nfunction through unrecognized cooptation, subordination or exclusion\nin various intersectional constellations. In general, continental\nfeminisms are less concerned with changing a woman\u2019s place in a\nsymbolic or social system, and more focused on upending such systems,\nas will be explored in more detail in the following sections.\n",
