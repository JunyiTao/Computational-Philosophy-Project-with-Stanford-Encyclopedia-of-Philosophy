    "main_text": "Dao and Virtue\n6. Dao and Virtue\n\n\nTo begin with Dao, the etymology of the Chinese graph or character\nsuggests a pathway, or heading in a certain direction along a\npath. Most commentators agree in translating dao as\n\u201cway.\u201d In early Chinese literature, dao generally\ndepicts a relatively wide thoroughfare or carriage way, and in some\ncontexts waterways, but it is used also to convey what is deemed the\nright or proper course, and by extension the doctrines or teachings\nthat set forth such a course, or the means and methods that would\nbring it about. Laozi 53, for example, states, \u201cThe\ngreat dao is very even (flat, easy to travel on), but people\nlike (to take) by-ways (jing).\u201d The literal sense\nof dao as a path, contrasted in this instance\nwith jing, a small trail off the main road, is clearly\npreserved here, but it is also easy to see how it can be used as a\nmetaphor, how the extended ethical and spiritual sense of dao\ncomes into the picture.\n\n\nAs a verb, perhaps on account of the directionality\ninvolved, dao also conveys the sense of\n\u201cspeaking.\u201d Thus, the opening phrase of chapter 1, dao\nke dao, literally \u201cDao that can be dao-ed,\u201d is often\nrendered, \u201cThe Way that can be spoken of.\u201d\nBecause dao is paired with \u201cname\u201d (ming)\nin the next line\u2014\u201cming ke ming,\u201d \u201cthe\nname that can be named\u201d\u2014forming a parallel couplet\nconstruction, there is thus reason to interpret the verbal usage in\nthe sense of something verbalized, as opposed to a pathway that is\ntravelled on, trodden, or followed. This is also how most commentators\nin traditional China have understood it: the many normative discourses\nthat clamor to represent the right way are seen to be fickle, partial\nand misleading. In most English translations, the capitalized\nform\u2014\u201cWay\u201d or \u201cDao\u201d (or\n\u201cTao\u201d)\u2014is used, to distinguish it from other usages\nof the term.\n\n\nThe concept of dao is not unique to the Laozi. A key\nterm in the philosophical vocabulary, it informs early Chinese\nphilosophy as a whole. It is interpreted differently, signifying a\nmeans to a higher end in some writings and as an end in itself in\nothers. The Laozi underscores both the ineffability and\ncreative power of Dao. This is distinctive and if one accepts the\nearly provenance of the text, charts a new course in the development\nof Chinese philosophy.\n\n\nThe ineffability of Dao is highlighted in chapter 1: the\n\u201cconstant\u201d (chang, also translated as\n\u201ceternal\u201d\u2014e.g., W. T. Chan 1963) Dao cannot be\ndefined or described; it is \u201cnameless.\u201d Chapter 14 brings\nout clearly that Dao transcends sensory perception; it has neither\nshape nor form. Nameless and formless, Dao can only be described as\nutterly profound, and in this sense \u201cdark\u201d or\n\u201cmysterious\u201d (xuan), or as wu, literally\n\u201cnot having\u201d any name, form, or other characteristics of\nthings (see also chs. 21 and 32). Indeed, though suggestive, the term\n\u201cDao\u201d itself is no more than a symbol\u2014as\nthe Laozi makes clear, \u201cI do not know its name; I style\nit Dao\u201d (ch. 25; see also ch. 34). This suggests a sense of\nradical transcendence, which explains why the Laozi has been\napproached so often as a mystical text.\n\n\nThe concept of wu is difficult and has been translated\nvariously as \u201cnothing,\u201d \u201cnothingness,\u201d or\n\u201cnonbeing.\u201d It marks not only the mystery of Dao but also\nits limitlessness or inexhaustibility (e.g., ch. 4). Names serve to\ndelimit, to set boundaries; in contrast, Dao is without limits and\ntherefore cannot be captured fully by language. This suggests a\npositive dimension to transcendence, which brings into view the\ncreative power of Dao: \u201cAll things under heaven are born of\nbeing (you); being is born of\nwu\u201d (ch. 40). What does this mean?\n\n\nElsewhere in the Laozi, Dao is said to be the\n\u201cbeginning\u201d of all things (chs. 1, 25). Daoist creation\ninvolves a process of differentiation from unity to multiplicity:\n\u201cDao gives birth to One; One gives birth to Two; Two gives birth\nto Three; Three gives birth to the ten thousand things\u201d\n(ch. 42). The text does not indicate tense or spell out what the\nnumbers refer to\u2014is it saying that something called the\n\u201cOne\u201d produced or produces the \u201cTwo\u201d in the\nsense of two other things?\n\n\nThe \u201cnothingness\u201d of Dao helps impose certain constraints\non interpretation. Specifically, the idea of a creator god with\nattributes, like the \u201cLord on High\u201d (Shangdi) in ancient\nChinese religion, does not seem to fit with the emphasis on\ntranscendence.\n\n\nThe dominant interpretation in traditional China is that Dao\nrepresents the source of the original, undifferentiated,\nessential qi-energy, the \u201cOne,\u201d which in turn\nproduces the yin and yang cosmic forces. While the\n\u201clighter,\u201d more rarefied yang energy-stuff rises to form\nheaven, the \u201cheavier\u201d yin solidifies to become earth. A\nfurther \u201cblending\u201d of the two generates a\n\u201charmonious\u201d qi-energy that informs human\nbeings.\n\n\nThis is essentially the reading of the Heshanggong\ncommentary. Although the Laozi may not have entertained a\nfully developed yin-yang cosmological theory, which took shape during\nthe Han period, it does suggest at one point that natural phenomena\nare constituted by yin and yang: the \u201cten thousand things\u201d\nor myriad creatures, as it rather lyrically puts it, \u201ccarry yin\non their backs and embrace yang with their arms\u201d (ch. 42). That\nwhich gave rise to the original qi-energy, however, is\nindescribable. The Laozi calls it Dao, or perhaps more\nappropriately in this context, \u201cthe Dao,\u201d with the\ndefinite article, to signal its presence as the source of the created\norder.\n\n\nIn modern terms, minus the language of yin-yang cosmology, this\ntranslates into an understanding of the Dao as \u201can absolute\nentity which is the source of the universe,\u201d as the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary (online edition, under \u201cTao\u201d)\ndefines it. Not being anything in particular, the Dao may be described\nas \u201cnothing\u201d (wu). However, on this\nreading, wu does not mean \u201cnothingness,\u201d\n\u201cnegativity\u201d or absence in the nihilistic sense, in view\nof the creative power of the Dao.\n\n\nAlternatively, one could argue that Dao signifies a conceptually\nnecessary ontological ground; it does not refer to any indescribable\noriginal substance or energy. \u201cBeginning\u201d is not a term of\ntemporal reference but suggests ontological priority in\nthe Laozi.\n\n\nThe process of creation does proceed from unity to multiplicity, but\nthe Laozi is only concerned to show that \u201ctwo\u201d\nwould be impossible without the idea of \u201cone.\u201d The\nassertion in Laozi 42, \u201cOne gives birth to Two,\u201d\naffirms that duality presupposes unity; to render it as \u201cThe One\ngave birth to the Two\u201d is to turn what is essentially a logical\nrelation into a cosmological event.\n\n\nAs the source of being, Dao cannot be itself a being, no matter how\npowerful or perfect; otherwise, the problem of infinite regress cannot\nbe overcome. For this reason, the Laozi makes use of the\nconcept of wu, \u201cnonbeing,\u201d not to suggest a\nsubstance or something of which nothing can be said, but to signify\nthe conceptual \u201cotherness\u201d and radical transcendence of\nthe ground of being.\n\n\nThis agrees with Wang Bi\u2019s interpretation. If wu points to a\nnecessary ontological foundation, the distinction between\n\u201cDao\u201d and \u201cOne\u201d seems redundant. Commenting on\nchapter 42 of the Laozi, Wang Bi writes, \u201cOne can be\nsaid to be wu\u201d; \u201cOne is the beginning of numbers\nand the ultimate of things\u201d (commentary on ch. 39; see also\nWang\u2019s commentary on the Yijing, trans. in Lynn 1994,\n60). The concept of \u201cOne\u201d and the concept of wu\nthus complement each other in disclosing different aspects of the\nlogic of creation\u2014both unity and nonbeing are necessary for\nunderstanding the generation of beings.\n\n\nComparing the two interpretations, whereas the first,\n\u201ccosmological\u201d reading has to explain the sense in which\nthe Dao can be said to be \u201cnothing,\u201d the second emphasizes\nthe centrality of wu, \u201cnonbeing,\u201d for which\n\u201cDao\u201d is but one designation. For the latter, Dao is\nentirely conceptual, whereas the former envisages the Dao as referring\nto a mysterious substance or energy that brings about the cosmos and\ncontinues to sustain and regulate it. Depending on the\ninterpretation, wu may be translated as \u201cnothing\u201d\nor \u201cnonbeing\u201d accordingly. The latter may be awkward, but\nit serves to alert the reader that the nothingness or emptiness of Dao\nmay not be understood referentially or reduced simply to the fullness\nof qi.\n\n\nIn light of the interest in cosmology during the Warring States\nperiod, the cosmological reading may be privileged, but\nthe Laozi is also open to an ontological interpretation. Both\nare philosophically potent. At one level, the ontological reading may\naccommodate the qi-based yin-yang cosmology, although there\nis significant divergence in the interpretation of the ethics of\nthe Laozi, as we shall see in the next section. In either\ncase, the metaphor of \u201cDao\u201d is apt. It shows that all\nthings are derived ultimately from an absolute\n\u201cbeginning,\u201d in either sense of the word, like the start\nof a pathway. It also suggests a direction to be followed, which\nbrings out the ethical interest of the Laozi.\n\n\nThe Daodejing is concerned with both Dao and de. The\ngraph de has also made it into the Oxford English\nDictionary: \u201cIn Taoism, the essence of Tao inherent in all\nbeings\u201d; \u201cin Confucianism and in extended use, moral\nvirtue.\u201d De has been translated variously as virtue,\npotency, efficacy, integrity, or power (for an etymological study, see\nNivison 1978\u201379, and Hall and Ames 1987, 216).\n\n\nLike Dao, de is a general concept open to diverse\ninterpretation. The Confucian understanding of de is by no\nmeans uniform (A. Chan 2011). While some early Ru scholars emphasize\nin their interpretation of \u201cvirtue\u201d the roles and\nresponsibilities embedded in the network of kinship ties and\nsociopolitical relationships that constitute the ethical realm, others\nfocus on the formation of individual moral character through\nself-cultivation. Confucius may have emphasized the latter, but there\nis ample evidence in the Analects and other Confucian works\ntestifying to the importance of the former as well. The Laozi\nseems to be suggesting a \u201chigher\u201d de against any\nmoral achievement attained through repeated effort (e.g., ch. 38). The\ndifferent translations mentioned above aim at bringing out the\nperceived uniquely Daoist understanding of de.\n\n\nAdmittedly, \u201cvirtue\u201d is ambiguous, and in Latin, as many\nscholars have noted, \u201cvirtus\u201d has more to do with\nstrength and capacity than moral virtues. Nevertheless, there are\nadvantages to translating de as \u201cvirtue,\u201d as it\nkeeps in the foreground that the Laozi is giving new meaning\nto an established concept, as opposed to introducing a new concept not\nfound in other schools of Chinese philosophy. From this perspective,\nboth Laozi and Confucius are interpreters of de-virtue.\n\n\nThe marriage of Dao and de effectively bridges the gap\nbetween transcendence and immanence. Traditional commentaries\nbeginning with the Hanfeizi often play on the homonymic\nrelation between de (virtue) and another graph also\npronounced de, which means to \u201cacquire\u201d or\n\u201cobtain\u201d something. De is thus what one has\n\u201cobtained\u201d from (the) Dao, a \u201clatent power\u201d by\n\u201cvirtue\u201d of which any being becomes what it is (Waley\n1958, 32). In this sense, the Laozi speaks of de as\nthat which nourishes all beings (e.g., ch. 51).\n\n\nWithin these parameters, interpretations of de follow from\nthe understanding of Dao and wu. On the one hand, for\nHeshanggong and other proponents of the cosmological view, what one\nhas obtained from the Dao refers specifically to one\u2019s qi\nendowment, which determines one\u2019s physical, intellectual, affective,\nmoral, and spiritual capacity. Read this way, the\ntitle Daodejing should be translated as the \u201cClassic of\nthe Way and Its Virtue,\u201d given that de is\nunderstood to have emanated from the Dao.\n\n\nOn the other hand, for Wang Bi and others who do not subscribe to a\nsubstantive view of Dao, de represents what is\n\u201cgenuine\u201d or \u201cauthentic\u201d (zhen) in\nhuman beings (e.g., see Wang Bi\u2019s commentary on Laozi chs. 3,\n5, 16, 51). Because wu does not refer to any substance or\ncosmological power, what the Laozi means by de, the\n\u201cvirtue\u201d that one has \u201cobtained\u201d from Dao, can\nonly be understood as what is originally, naturally present in human\nbeings.\n\n\nIn either case, the concept of de emerges as a Daoist\nresponse to the question of human nature, which was one of the most\ncontested issues in early Chinese philosophy. The two readings of\nthe Laozi, despite their differences, agree that it is an\ninherent de that enables a person to conform to the way in\nwhich Dao operates. \u201cVirtue\u201d may be corrupted easily, but\nwhen realized, it radiates the full embodiment of the Dao understood\nin terms of qi on Heshanggong\u2019s view, or the flourishing of\nauthenticity on Wang Bi\u2019s interpretation. As such, Dao points to not\nonly the \u201cbeginning\u201d but also through de the\n\u201cend\u201d of all things.\n",
