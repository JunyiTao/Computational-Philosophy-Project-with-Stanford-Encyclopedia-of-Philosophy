Life and Writings\n\n\nGodfrey of Fontaines was born in present day Belgium in the\nprincipality of Li\u00e8ge, very likely at the chateau of the noble\nfamily of which he was a member, at Fontaines-les Hoz\u00e9mont,\nprobably shortly before 1250. This approximate date can be inferred\nfrom the fact that he conducted his first quodlibetal dispute as a\nMaster of Theology at Paris in 1285, and that one could not become a\nMaster in this faculty before reaching the age of 35. While nothing is\nknown with certainty about his life prior to his arrival at Paris, he\nmust have pursued philosophical studies there in the Faculty of Arts in\nthe early 1270s. University statutes required one to spend at least\neight years in studying theology before becoming a Master, and it is\nalso known that he was inscribed at the Sorbonne before August 15,\n1274. Hence his theological studies should have begun by that date (De\nWulf, 1904, 3\u201316; Wippel, 1981, xv\u2013xviii).\n\n\nGodfrey was evidently a great lover of books, and among the surviving\n37 manuscripts he left to the Sorbonne is a valuable \u201cStudent\nNotebook\u201d (Paris: Bibl. Nat. lat. 16.297) which he himself compiled\nduring his student days at Paris, and into which he entered many\nwritings in his own hand.  While it was not completed by 1274 or\nearlier as was previously proposed, the most recent research indicates\nthat it was formed by Godfrey almost entirely between the end of 1276\nand 1278, with the exception of the final small portion copied at the\nearliest between 1278\u20131280 and at the latest between 1280\u20131281\n(Aiello-Wielockx, 2008, 167). It reflects his interests in the 1270s\nduring his time as a theology student at Paris and includes works by\nThomas Aquinas, Siger of Brabant, Boethius of Dacia, other anonymous\nQuestions on various works of Aristotle which are clearly by some\nMaster(s) of Arts of the time, still others by Giles of Rome, some\nextracts from Albert the Great and from Henry of Ghent, as well as\nother purely theological writings (Duin, 1959; Wippel, 2001, 360\u201367;\nand now an exhaustive study by Aiello-Wielockx, 2008). An anonymous\nset of Questions on Bks. I\u2013II of Aristotle\u2019s De anima\ncontained in this same Student Notebook has recently been assigned to\nBoethius of Dacia and edited (Wielockx, 2009). Godfrey\u2019s interest in\nthe writings of Radical Aristotelian Arts Masters at Paris in the\n1260s and 1270s is also indicated by other works of Arts Masters\nincluded in additional manuscripts in his library\n(Bibl. Nat. lat. 15.819, 16.096). Also noteworthy is the inclusion in\nhis Student Notebook of one of the oldest and most reliable copies of\nThomas Aquinas\u2019s controversial De aeternitate mundi, which\nitself dates probably from 1271. And Godfrey\u2019s interest in and reaction to the thought of important contemporary members of the Theology Faculty at Paris such as Henry of Ghent and Giles of Rome and others is evident from the contents of various manuscripts containing writings by them in his personal library (Wielockx, 2014). \n\n Godfrey continued to teach as a Master of Theology at the\nUniversity until ca. 1303/1304 when he conducted his fifteenth and\nlast Quodlibetal Disputation, and he was in Paris for a meeting at the\nSorbonne in February 1304. He may have been away from Paris for some\nmore extended periods after completing Quodlibet XIV\nca. 1298\u20131299. It is known that he maintained close connections\nwith Li\u00e8ge during his career at Paris and, indeed, that he\nserved as Canon of Li\u00e8ge.  He also served as Provost of San\nSeverin at Cologne, and as Canon of Tournai although some doubt has\nbeen raised about the last mentioned point (Field, 2009, 138,\nn. 11). It has also been reported that he was elected Bishop of\nTournai in 1300 but renounced his rights to the See when the election\nwas contested. While some question about the accuracy of this has also\nbeen raised (Field, ibid.), it is certain that he was involved in\nnegotiating a settlement for the disputed election and that this\nrequired him to travel to Rome to present the case to the Roman\nCuria. The year of his death is not known with certainty but has been\nproposed as probably 1306 (or 1309 which seems to be too late), even\nthough the day is known, i.e., October 29 according to the necrology\nof the Sorbonne.\n\n\nGodfrey selected the quodlibetal disputation as his major vehicle for\npublication. These solemn disputations were conducted twice during the\nacademic year, i.e., before Christmas and before Easter. They were\nopen to all members of the learned public and questions could be put\nto the presiding Master by anyone in attendance. During the first\nday\u2019s disputation, preliminary answers would be given to these many\nand disparate questions. On the following day or at least on some\nfollowing day, the Master, having in the meantime imposed some logical\norganizing plan upon the various questions, would return for another\nsession where he would present his definitive response or\n\u201cdetermination\u201d for each of them. Subsequently he would prepare this\nversion for publication and, when it was completed, would submit it to\nthe University Bookseller.  Masters were not required to conduct these\nopen disputations and since they were regarded as onerous, not all\ndid. Godfrey\u2019s 15 Quodlibets have all been edited, although only\nreportationes of the first four remain, i.e., copies taken\ndown by an auditor. Brief versions (abbreviationes) of\nQuodlibets III and IV have also been edited. Since medieval times\nthere has been some difficulty about the literary form of Quodlibet\nXIV concerning whether it really is a Quodlibet or some other kind of\ndisputed question. Wippel (2006) concludes it is more probable that it\nis indeed a Quodlibet, but one that is unique in terms of its\norganizing plan and structure. As a Master of theology Godfrey also\nconducted ordinary Disputed Questions, and some of these have been\npreserved.\n2. Subject of Metaphysics\n\n\nGodfrey was surely familiar with the controversy concerning whether\none should with Avicenna stress the nonparticular and therefore the\nuniversal character of being as being and hence make this the subject\nof metaphysics or rather with Averroes emphasize it as the science\nwhich has the highest kind of being, the divine, as its subject. On\nthis Godfrey clearly agrees with Avicenna, even though he devotes\nlittle explicit attention to the controversy itself. Thus in Quodlibet\nX, q. 11 he holds that being as being is the object (or subject) of\nmetaphysics (PB 4.349), and in Quodlibet VI, q. 6 that the concept of\nbeing is first and simplest because it enters into every other concept\n(PB 3.137). Therefore it is also the most general concept or, one may\nsay, transcendental. At times Godfrey also describes the object of the\nintellect as being as being (Quodlibet II, q. 8). He denies that God is\nthe subject of metaphysics, even though God is the first and primary\nbeing and must be studied within metaphysics (Quodlibet I, q. 5). He\ndistinguishes a metaphysical study of God, which he says may be\ndescribed as a kind of theology, from the theology that is based on\nSacred Scripture. This does not have being as being as its subject, but\nGod himself (Quodlibet IX, q. 20; Wippel, 1981, 3\u201315).\n3. Division of Being\n\n\nIn opposition to Henry of Ghent\u2019s division of real being into\nessential being (esse essentiae) and existential being\n(esse existentiae), in Quodlibet VIII, q. 3 Godfrey proposes\nhis own division. Being (esse) may be divided into being in\nthe mind (\u201ccognitive\u201d being) which is a lesser or diminished being, and\nreal being, i.e., being outside the mind or knower. Real being is\nsubdivided into real being in potency and real being in act. A thing\npossesses real being in potency insofar as it has being by reason of\nits cause or causes. It has real being in act insofar as it is realized\nin its own nature in completed or perfected form. A thing may have real\nbeing in potency either by reason of its intrinsic cause (e.g., if\nmatter preexists which may enter into the thing\u2019s constitution), or by\nreason of an extrinsic cause (e.g., if an agent preexists which can\nproduce it). Godfrey illustrates this with the example of a rose that\ndoes not yet actually exist. Prior to the creation of the world and\nhence of matter it possessed real being in potency only by reason of\nGod, its extrinsic cause. After creation it possessed real being in\npotency by reason of preexisting matter as well, an intrinsic cause.\nAnd now it may also possess real potential being by reason of some\ncreated extrinsic cause (or causes). Both before and after the world\u2019s\ncreation it enjoys cognitive being insofar as it was and is known by\nthe divine mind (PB 4.38\u201340; Wippel, 1981, 15\u201317).\n4. Analogy of Being\n\n\nIn describing being as being as the object of the intellect in\nQuodlibet II, q. 8, Godfrey also states that being is taken\nanalogically and not univocally. It is affirmed first and foremost of\nsubstance, especially of first substance, and of everything else as\nrelated to substance. Hence both substance and accident are included\nunder this analogous notion of being and this single object of the\nintellect (PB 2.135\u201336; Wippel, 1981, 19\u201324). In Quodlibet III, q. 1 he\nattempts to establish the analogical character of being by arguing at\nsome length that it cannot be either univocal or purely equivocal.\nCentral to his rejection of univocity of being is his denial that it is\na supreme genus. It must apply not only to the generic and specific\naspects in which different things share, but also to the differences,\nincluding the individual differences between them (PB 2.162\u201363). In\nQuodlibet XV, q. 3, while responding to an objection perhaps taken from\nMeister Eckhart\u2019s Parisian Disputed Question 1, he maintains that, if\nbeing is applied to accidents insofar as they are related to substance\nin some way, this does not mean that being is not intrinsically present\nin accidents. So, too, when it is applied to creatures viewed as\neffects and to God their cause, it applies intrinsically to God. There\nis an analogy and proportion in reality between these different\ninstantiations of being and corresponding to this, there is analogy in\nmeaning as well. It is this that is grasped by the analogous concept of\nbeing (PB 14.18\u201320; Wippel, 2001, 381\u201382).\n5. Transcendentals\n\n\nIn Quodlibet III, q. 1 Godfrey identifies the one, the true, and the\ngood as properties of being that are really identical and convertible\nwith it, and hence as transcendental characteristics of being. These\nproperties are not really distinct from being itself (PB 2.163\u201364). In\nQuodlibet VI, q. 16 he distinguishes between the one or the kind of\nunity that serves as a principle for number and which is based on\ndiscrete quantity (numerical unity in the strict sense), and the kind\nthat is convertible with being. While the former is restricted to\ncorporeal being, the latter applies to every subsisting substance and\nto every accident that exists in such a substance. Hence it alone is\ntranscendental (PB 3.256\u201358). Regarding the true, in Quodlibet VI, q. 6\nGodfrey indicates that truth adds nothing real to being but only a\n(conceptual) relationship to mind or intellect. To assign this kind of\ntruth to a thing is simply to acknowledge that it can be grasped by\nintellect or that it is intelligible. Consequently, Godfrey holds that\ntruth is present in being virtually insofar as it has the capacity\n(virtus) to produce truth in the intellect. But he favors the\nview that when taken formally truth resides in the intellect (PB\n3.137\u201341; Wippel, 1981, 25\u201334). Hence here he is recognizing the\ndistinction later referred to as that between ontological truth and\nlogical truth.\n6. Essence and Existence\n\n\nAlready during Godfrey\u2019s student days in Arts and in Theology at\nParis there was considerable discussion concerning the exact\nrelationship between essence and existence in finite or created beings.\nClosely associated with the metaphysical thought of Aquinas was the\nview that in all finite beings there is a real, i.e., not merely a\nconceptual or mind-dependent distinction and composition of an essence\nprinciple and an act of existing (esse) or existence\nprinciple. Already in the 1270s Giles of Rome was developing his own\ntheory of real distinction between essence and existence, and was soon\nengaged in ongoing controversy with Henry of Ghent. At times Giles\nreferred to essence and existence as distinct \u201cthings\u201d (res)\nand, while he denied that either could exist in separation from the\nother or that existence is an essence, his terminology left its mark on\nthe theory and open to such misinterpretations; for it invited critics\nto view existence or the act of being as an entity rather than as a\nprinciple of an existing entity, as Aquinas had envisioned it. While\nHenry of Ghent rejected any real distinction between essence and\nexistence, he defended something more than a merely conceptual\ndistinction between them, namely a new and third type that would fall\nbetween the real distinction and the merely conceptual, an\n\u201cintentional\u201d distinction (Wippel, 1981, 40\u201345).\n\n\nGodfrey briefly refers to this issue in Quodlibet II, q. 2, while\nattempting to determine whether the essence of a creature is\nindifferent to existence and nonexistence. He comments that either\nessence is really identical with existence and differs from it (1) only\nconceptually or (2) intentionally, or else (3) existence is a distinct\nthing, i.e., the act of the essence and really distinct from it (PB\n2.60). In Quodlibet IV, q. 2, he was asked to determine whether to hold\nthat predicamental things are eternal by reason of their quiddity is\nalso to hold that the world is eternal. In preparing his response he\npresents in greater detail these three different views on the\nrelationship between essence and existence (esse). According\nto some they are really distinct from one another and enter into real\ncomposition with one another. But one is not separable from the other\nso as to be able to exist apart from it. Consequently, if a thing lacks\nor loses its existential being, it also lacks or loses its essential\nbeing. According to a second view they are really identical, but differ\nintentionally. Hence when a thing loses its existential being, its\nessence cannot be said to exist; but it does retain its true\npredicamental or essential being (esse essentiae). Finally, a\nthird position, which Godfrey himself embraces, maintains that they are\nreally identical and differ only conceptually. They do not enter into\ncomposition with one another. Therefore, to the extent that something\nenjoys essential being, to that same degree it enjoys actual existence.\nAnd, adds Godfrey, whatever is understood of one is also understood of\nthe other (PB 2.235).\n\n\nIn Quodlibet III, q. 1, dating from 1286, Godfrey considers the\nargumentation offered for each of these positions. First he presents\nthe theory that distinguishes really between essence and existence in\nlanguage that reflects the terminology of Giles of Rome. Thus he\nrefers to existence both as \u201csomething\u201d (aliquid)\nand as a \u201cthing\u201d (res) that is added to\nessence. He then presents a number of arguments in support of this\nview which seem to be taken from Giles, especially from his\nQuaestiones disputatae de esse et essentia, q. 11. One of\nthese is reminiscent of the first part of Aquinas\u2019s much discussed\nreasoning in De ente et essentia, c.  4, which begins from\nthe fact that one can understand what something is without knowing\nwhether it actually exists. However, Giles\u2019s presentation (and\nGodfrey\u2019s repetition) of the argument makes a stronger claim. One can\nunderstand what something is and also know that it does not exist. But\nbecause nothing can be understood with the opposite of itself, essence\nand existence must be really distinct.  After presenting a series of\narguments against this theory and refuting the arguments he had\ninitially offered in support of it, Godfrey resolutely rejects any\nreal distinction between essence and existence.  For him they are\nidentical, and differ only in the way they signify, just as the\nconcrete noun \u201ca being\u201d (ens), the abstract noun\n\u201cessence\u201d (essentia), and the verb \u201cto\nbe\u201d or \u201cto exist\u201d (esse) differ in their\nmode of signifying, but designate one and the same reality (PB 3.304\n[brief version]; Wippel, 1981, 45\u201366).\n\n\nIn presenting Henry\u2019s theory of intentional distinction Godfrey\ntraces this back in large measure to what he regards as an incorrect\ninterpretation of Avicenna\u2019s notion of nature or essence when it is\nconsidered simply in itself or \u201cabsolutely\u201d rather than as existing in\nthe mind or in an individual entity. As Godfrey explains in his later\nQuodlibet VIII, q. 3, according to Henry\u2019s position real being is\ndivided into essential being (esse essentiae) and existential\nbeing (esse existentiae). A thing possesses essential being\nfrom eternity insofar as it corresponds to its appropriate exemplar\nidea within the divine intellect. Because of this it is a true or real\nquiddity or essence from eternity and falls into its appropriate\npredicament even though it is not an actual existent. Existing entities\nreceive actual existence only in the course of time when the divine\nwill intervenes to cause this. Within an actually existing being,\ntherefore, its essence and existence are not really distinct. But Henry\ndenies that they are identical. They are \u201cintentionally\u201d distinct\n(Wippel, 1981, 67\u201379; Marrone, 2001, 39\u201352; Porro, 1996, 211\u201353).\nGodfrey rejects Henry\u2019s new and intermediary kind of distinction out of\nhand. A distinction must either be real or purely conceptual.\nAccordingly, in Quodlibet III, q. 1 he argues at length against Henry\u2019s\napplication of the intentional distinction to essence and existence\n(Wippel, 1981), 85\u201388.\n\n\nAs already noted, for Godfrey essence and existence are really\nidentical and only differ conceptually. Whatever is true of essence is\ntrue of existence, and vice versa. It is not necessary to posit two\nreally distinct or even two intentionally distinct principles to\naccount for the fact that one may be aware of something as a possible\nexistent when it does not actually exist. It is enough to distinguish\nbetween potential being and actual being. If something is in potency in\nterms of its essence, it is in potency in terms of its existence. And\nif it is actual in terms of its essence, it is actual in terms of its\nexistence.\n\n\nGodfrey proposes a different kind of act-potency \u201ccomposition\u201d in\norder to meet one argument in support of real distinction between\nessence and existence. If, as Aquinas, Giles, and Godfrey all hold, the\nangels of Christianity are purely spiritual and not composed of\n(spiritual) matter and form, then it seems that they must be composed\nof essence and existence. Otherwise they would be perfectly simple and\nequal to God. Godfrey responds that one and the same being, even if\npurely spiritual, may be regarded as actual insofar as it exists, but\nas potential insofar as it falls short of the actuality enjoyed by a\nhigher being and, above all, by the First Being, God. He quotes\nProposition 2 from Proclus\u2019s Elementatio theologica: \u201cWhat\nparticipates in the One is both One and not-One.\u201d As Godfrey reads\nthis, anything that is different from the One can fall short of it only\nby approaching (accessus) the not-one. Hence it is simply by\nreason of the fact that such a being recedes from the One that it is\nnot the One itself. In this way more perfect beings such as angels are\ndistinct from the One, or God, without being composed either of matter\nand form or of essence and existence. Nonetheless, actuality and\npotentiality are present in them because they possess a certain\nintermediary nature and hence are likened or \u201cassimilated\u201d to something\nhigher and more actual, and to something lower and more potential.\nTherefore they are \u201ccomposed\u201d of potency and act, not really, but\nconceptually. This composition is not merely imaginary. It applies to\nsuch entities by their being related to something higher and to\nsomething lower (Quodlibet III, qq. 1, 3; Quodlibet VII, q. 7; Wippel,\n1981, 90\u201397).\n\n\nGodfrey\u2019s library contains two likely sources for this theory, first a\nrudimentary version found in the abbreviated text of Siger of\nBrabant\u2019s Quaestiones in Metaphysicam included in Godfrey\u2019s\nStudent Notebook, and second, an anonymous set of questions contained\nin the manuscript Bibl. Nat. lat. 16.096. While Godfrey\nliterally borrows certain parts of his theory from the second text, he\ndoes not follow this anonymous Radical Aristotelian Arts Master when\nhe goes on to argue that separate entities do not depend upon God as\ntheir efficient cause, but only as their final cause (Wippel, 1984,\n231\u201344).\n7. Philosophical Knowledge of God\u2019s Existence\n\n\nAccording to Godfrey, insofar as a natural knowledge of God is\naccessible to human reason, it belongs more properly to metaphysics\nthan does knowledge of any other being. And he clearly holds that God\u2019s\nexistence can be established by philosophical reasoning. But Avicenna\nand Averroes had differed concerning whether it belongs to natural\nphilosophy (physics) or to metaphysics to demonstrate this conclusion.\nAvicenna had maintained that this task pertains to metaphysics and only\nto metaphysics, whereas Averroes had defended the opposite position\nthat only physics can demonstrate the existence of God, the First Mover\n(Wippel, 1981, 102\u20133). As will be seen more fully in the following\nsection, Godfrey defends something of a compromise position. In\nQuodlibet XI, q. 1 he mentions that the metaphysician\u2019s consideration\nof God in himself is more perfect than that of the natural philosopher,\nwho simply views him as the First Mover of the first mobile being,\ni.e., the outermost heavenly sphere. But, Godfrey adds, by reason of\nall that God is in himself, he is also the First Mover (PB 5.3). In\nQuodlibet V, q. 10 he writes that one can know by reasoning from\nnatural things that God is the first being which depends on nothing\nwhatsoever and upon which everything else depends and, therefore, that\nhe is the causal and productive principle of all other things (PB 3.41;\nWippel, 1981, 105). And in Quodlibet IX, q. 20, he refers to different\nthings that natural reason can know in metaphysics with certainty about\nGod\u2014that because he is the first being he is simple; that he is\nbeing in actuality; that he is an intellectual being, etc. (PB\n4.288).\n8. Quidditative Knowledge of God and the Divine Attributes\n\n\nIn Quodlibet VII, q. 11 Godfrey considers the view of some,\npresumably Thomas Aquinas, who say that in this life we can know that\nGod is, but not what he is. Godfrey makes a clear but implicit\nreference to ST I, q. 3, a. 4 where Thomas writes that even when we\nrecognize that God is, the \u201cis\u201d which we understand is not the act of\nbeing whereby God subsists in himself, but only that indicating that\nthe proposition \u201cthat he is\u201d is true (PB 3.383).\n\n\nGodfrey finds this too restrictive. And so after offering a detailed\nexplanation of the different ways in which one can know of something\n\u201cwhat it is\u201d and \u201cthat it is,\u201d he writes that\njust as in knowing material things we move from more confused to less\nconfused knowledge, so it is in the case of our natural knowledge of\nGod. Just as we find that some things are the principal causes of\nothers, and some are governed by others, so we impose the name\n\u201cGod\u201d to signify something in the universe which is the\none first cause of everything else and than which nothing greater can\nbe thought. But such nominal knowledge is not enough to prove that\nwhat we express by the name \u201cGod\u201d exists in reality or\n\u201cthat he is.\u201d Next we may follow Aristotle\u2019s procedure in\nPhysics VII where by eliminating recourse to an infinite\nregress of moved movers he concludes that one First Mover or God\nexists. And from the continuous motion of the first mobile sphere\nAristotle shows in Physics VIII that God is perpetual and\npure act. This tells us that God is in reality, but not what he is in\nany real sense. In the Metaphysics (Bk XII), continues\nGodfrey, Aristotle accepts the knowledge \u201cthat God is\u201d as\nproved in the Physics and now proceeds to show that certain\nperfections are present in God to the preeminent degree. According to\nGodfrey, Aristotle uses these perfections as quasi-differences and\nthereby progresses from knowledge \u201cthat God is\u201d to\nknowledge \u201cwhat he is\u201d by passing from a confused and\nquasi-generic knowledge to a more determined and quasi-specific\nknowledge. And so, too, proposes Godfrey, we may reason, for instance,\nfirst by knowing him as a substance, then as an incorporeal substance,\nthen as a living and intelligent incorporeal substance. He\nacknowledges that God does not really fall into any genus or\nspecies. Nonetheless, he maintains against Aquinas that we can know\n\u201cwhat God is\u201d in some real sense, even though he\nrecognizes that in this life such knowledge will always be imperfect\n(PB 3.384\u201386; Wippel, 1981, 108\u201315).\n Consistent with the above, Godfrey defends the presence of a\nplurality of attributes in God even though, because of the divine\nsimplicity, these are only conceptually distinct from the divine\nessence and from one another. In Quodlibet VII, q. 1 he distinguishes\ntwo ways in which the term \u201cattribute\u201d may be taken. It\nmay be used to signify a divine perfection in the sense that some\nperfection in a creature which does not imply any imperfection in and\nof itself, in other words a pure perfection, is assigned to God to an\neminent degree.  Or it may be taken as signifying a pure perfection\nwhich is realized in God as a \u201cquasi-quality\u201d which\nperfects the divine substance in a \u201cquasi-accidental\u201d\nfashion. Godfrey comments that it is in this second sense that\nattributes are usually applied to God, even though this is not\nintended to imply any real distinction or composition of substance and\nattribute in him. When taken in this second sense, Godfrey holds that\nthere are many such quasi-qualities which perfect God in this\nquasi-accidental way, and therefore, many divine attributes. They are\nassigned to God in preeminent fashion because of his infinite\nperfection (PB 3.265).\n\n\nIn this same question Godfrey was asked to resolve a still more\nfundamental issue. Because of God\u2019s absolute simplicity, divine\nattributes signify perfections that are really identical with the\ndivine essence and with one another. The conceptual distinction between\nthem can only arise from an intellect\u2019s consideration. But what is the\nultimate foundation for this conceptual distinction? Does it arise from\na consideration of God simply as he is in himself, or does it only\nresult from some reference to really distinct realizations of these\nperfections in creatures? Godfrey replies that if one takes an\nattribute in the first sense as implying that every pure perfection\npresent in creatures is to be assigned to God to an infinite degree,\nthe answer is clear. The intellect, especially a created intellect, can\narrive at such a conceptual distinction of divine attributes only by\nreasoning from the really distinct instantiations of such perfections\nin creatures (PB 3.267\u201370; Wippel, 1981, 116\u201318). But what about the\ndivine intellect? Godfrey then refers to and rejects the view of Henry\nof Ghent, according to whom attributes, when taken in the second sense,\ncan be recognized as distinct and as multiple by God himself insofar as\nhe views himself directly and without any reference to creatures.\nAgainst Henry, Godfrey maintains that not even God himself can be aware\nof this conceptual distinction between the divine attributes without\nreferring to other beings in which these perfections are present in\nreally distinct fashion. To hold otherwise would be to introduce too\nmuch distinction and diversity into the divine essence itself and would\nthereby compromise the divine simplicity (PB 3.267\u201373; Wippel, 1981,\n118\u201323; Maurer, 1999, 192\u2013200).\n9. Eternity of the World\n\n\nTogether with his Christian contemporaries, Godfrey believed that\nthe world began to be. But much debated was the question whether\nnatural reason can prove this, or whether it can be held solely on the\ngrounds of religious faith. Probably best known for holding that it\ncannot be demonstrated that the world began to be was Thomas Aquinas\nwho in his De aeternitate mundi went a step beyond his earlier\nwritings and maintained not only this but also that an eternally\ncreated world is possible (Wippel, 1984a, 203\u201314). Bonaventure had\npresented a series of arguments to prove that the world began to be,\nand many others strongly defended this position, including Henry of\nGhent (Dales, 1990; Wippel, 1981, 153\u201358). Thus it is not surprising\nthat in his Quodlibet II, q. 3 of Lent, 1286, Godfrey was asked to\ndetermine whether the world or any creature could be or exist from\neternity.\n\n\nGodfrey develops his position in conscious opposition to Henry of\nGhent, and with a considerable but unacknowledged dependency on\nAquinas\u2019s De aeternitate mundi which, as noted above, was\ncontained in his Student Notebook. But after he has, with Aquinas,\nshown that there is no contradiction in holding that something can be\ncreated and still not have begun to be, Godfrey considers certain\nobjections against this position. One of these objections clearly gives\nhim pause. If the world had been created from eternity, on every given\nday extending backward into a beginningless past God could have created\nsome material object such as a stone. But if that had happened, an\nactual infinity of stones would now exist and God could unite all of\nthem into one infinite body. But an infinite body is an impossibility,\nand so too is an infinity of simultaneously existing finite bodies and,\ntherefore, so is an eternally created world (PB 2.68\u201369, 76; Wippel,\n1981, 160\u201363).\n\n\nGodfrey comments that this objection can also be formulated more\nforcefully in terms of human souls, i.e., the actual infinity of human\nsouls that would have resulted from an eternal world eternally\npopulated by human beings with immortal souls. Aquinas had considered\nthis form of the objection in his De aeternitate mundi, and\nhad noted that it has not yet been demonstrated that God could not\nproduce an actual infinity of spiritual beings. Godfrey does not adopt\nthis solution, presumably because he is convinced that an actual\ninfinity of entities whether spiritual or material is impossible.\nInstead he proposes as a possible alternative an eternally populated\nworld involving the transmigration of a finite number of souls to an\ninfinity of bodies, and ordered only to their natural perfection. But\nbecause this world seems to be intended primarily for human beings\ndestined to enjoy eternal happiness in soul and body, Godfrey grants\nthat it may be argued with probability that this world could not have\nbeen created from eternity under the present dispensation by God\u2019s\nordained power. But, he also remarks, this does not prove that no\ncreature or no world could have been eternally created. He concludes\nthat it cannot be demonstrated either that an eternal world is not\npossible, or that it is possible. Either side may be regarded as\nprobable, and neither is to be rejected as theologically erroneous (PB\n2.79\u201380; Wippel, 1981, 167\u201368).\n10. Substance, Accidents, Human Action\n\n\nIn Quodlibet XIV, q. 5 Godfrey contrasts mental being with\nextramental being and then divides the latter into being per\nse and being per accidens. Being per se is\ndivided into substance and the nine genera of accidents. The latter may\nbe regarded as real modes of substance or of being in the unqualified\nsense (ens simpliciter). As Godfrey indicates elsewhere, a\nsubstance enjoys a separate being or exists in itself, while it is of\nthe nature of an accident to be ordered to and to exist in something\nelse. An accident is not so much a being as \u201cof a being\u201d (PB 5.427) For\npractical purposes Godfrey accepts the number of predicaments as ten,\nbut indicates that determination of their precise number is a matter of\nprobability rather than certainty (Wippel, 1981, 174\u201375). For Godfrey\nsubstance and accident are related as potency and act since substance\nserves as a subject for its accidents. Because of this he denies that\nany substance can be the efficient cause of the accidents that inhere\nin it, for it would then be in act with respect to them (as their\nefficient cause) and in potency (as receiving them) at one and the same\ntime. He would always insist that nothing can be in act and in potency\nat one and the same time with respect to the same thing for this would\nbe to assign being and nonbeing to it simultaneously. He also holds\nagainst many of his contemporaries that the powers of the soul are\nreally distinct from the essence of the soul and from one another\n(Wippel, 1981, 176\u201384, 202\u20137).\nAn unusual theory to account for the increase or decrease in the\nintensity of an accidental quality such as the whiteness of an object\nor an increase or decrease of charity in the human soul was attributed\nto Godfrey by medieval critics of this view such as John Duns Scotus\nor a few years later (ca. 1323) by Walter Burley as well as by many\nothers. According to this position, when such a quality increases or\ndecreases in intensity, the previous quality is completely corrupted\nand replaced by a newly generated and numerically distinct\nquality. There is a textual problem concerning Godfrey\u2019s personal\nposition because his explicit discussion of this in his Disputed\nQuestion 18 is incomplete in the two known surviving manuscripts that\ncontain it.  Modern scholars are divided about the accuracy of the\nattribution of this view to Godfrey. Anneliese Maier (Maier, 2nd ed.,\n1951, 3rd rev. ed., 1968) and John Wippel (Wippel,1979) challenged the\nreliability of this attribution. Edith Dudley Sylla published an\narticle dealing with Godfrey\u2019s explanation of changes in the quantity\nof the Eucharistic species after transubstantiation which, she\nmaintained, indicated that Godfrey defended a similar \u201csuccession\ntheory\u201d to account for changes in quantity, and suggested that this\nmay have led Scotus to attribute to him the succession theory in\nchanges of qualities (Sylla, 1981). More recently, in two jointly\nauthored studies Jean Celeyrette and Jean-Luc Sol\u00e8re argue that\nGodfrey did indeed defend the succession theory in accounting for\nincreases or decreases in qualities (Ceyerlette and Sol\u00e8re,\n2002, 2009). Stephen Dumont has recently published a lengthy study\ndrawing upon discussions by Scotus, Burley, and many other medieval\nwriters to support this claim as well (Dumont, 2009). In light of\nthese recent and well documented contributions, I myself would\ncertainly grant that Godfrey could have defended such a position, and\neven that he may have done so, but in the absence of any known text in\nwhich he explicitly and clearly defends this position, I do not think\nthat this has yet been conclusively demonstrated. One hopes that one\nday the complete text of his Disputed Question 18 will be found in\nsome manuscript, and that then the historical issue can be\ndefinitively resolved. Until that happens I would recommend a healthy\nskepticism about this issue, even as one of the texts cited by Dumont,\ntaken from a known critic of Godfrey\u2019s views on many points (Bernard\nof Auvergne), expresses doubt concerning whether Godfrey really held\nthis position, and rejects it if indeed he did, but not if Godfrey was\nreferring to different degrees of a quallty rather than to different\nqualities themselves in such changes (Dumont, 2009, 80, 118).\n\n    \n\nIf the soul\u2019s immanent operations such as thinking or willing inhere\nin their respective powers, the intellect and the will, those powers\nthemselves cannot be the efficient causes of such acts. Against Henry\nof Ghent and later in Quodlibet XV against the Franciscan Gonsalvus of\nSpain, Godfrey denies that any exception can be made to the\nact-potency axiom. Therefore the will cannot reduce itself from potency to act\nor immediately efficiently cause its acts of volition. The efficient\ncause of volition can only be the object presented to the will by the\nintellect. Against the charge of intellectual determinism sometimes\nattributed to this position by its critics, Godfrey grounds human\nfreedom in the radical indeterminacy, he even speaks of the freedom,\nof the intellect itself.  And in his final Quodlibet XV, q. 4, he\nargues that if, per impossibile, the will could move itself\ndirectly without being moved by its object, freedom would be less well\npreserved than if one maintains with him that the will is moved by its\nobject and then moves the apprehensive powers to their respective acts\nand, by means of such motions, indirectly moves itself with respect to\nsecondary objects of volition (PB 14.20\u201323; Putallaz, 1995,\n184\u201387, 198\u2013208, 233\u201347; Kent, 1995,\n108\u20139, 141\u201342; Osborne, 2015; Hartman, 2014). \n\nIn Quodlibet VII, q.5 Godfrey was asked whether a supposit (a concrete existing subject) adds any reality (res) to essence or nature. He maintains that in terms of their primary meaning or denotation, supposit and nature are really one\nand the same, but in terms of its connotation, the term \u2018supposit\u2019\nsignifies something more than does the term \u2018nature\u2019, that is, those\naccidents without which a supposit would not exist in the concrete\norder, and the exclusion of dependence upon another subject or center\nof existence. This has important implications for his theological\ndiscussion of the union of human nature and a divine person in Christ\naccording to Christian faith (Wippel, 1981, 227\u201346; Cross, 2002, 69\u201370, 114\u201319, 290\u201395)\n11. Theory of Abstraction\n\n\nAccording to Godfrey the agent intellect and the possible intellect\nare distinct powers of the individual human soul. His theory of\nintellectual knowledge is based on the agent intellect\u2019s ability to\nabstract potentially intelligible content from phantasms (images)\nproduced by the imagination, an internal sense. The imagination depends\nupon the external senses for the data preserved in the phantasms. In\nQuodlibet V, q. 10 he makes a studied effort to explain in what the\nprocess of abstraction from phantasms consists as he responds to the\nquestion whether the agent intellect produces any positive disposition\nin the phantasm. One of the functions of the agent intellect is to\nilluminate phantasms so that they can move the possible intellect to\nunderstand. Because the possible intellect is at times only in potency\nwith respect to an intelligible object, and because nothing can reduce\nitself from potency to act, it must be reduced to the act of\nunderstanding by something else. Hence the agent intellect must in some\nway enable phantasms to move or to actualize the possible\nintellect.\n\n\nBut, argues Godfrey, because phantasms exist in the imagination and\nare organic and individuated and therefore incapable of moving a\npurely spiritual power which knows in universal fashion, the agent\nintellect does not introduce any positive disposition into the\nphantasms. Such a disposition would itself be individuated and organic\nand incapable of moving the possible intellect. He concludes,\ntherefore, that the agent intellect operates on the phantasm simply by\nremoving or separating or isolating one factor present\ntherein\u2014the quiddity of the thing, from another\u2014its\nindividuating characteristics. What has been so removed or separated\nor abstracted is thereby rendered universal and capable of moving the\npossible intellect. In what would become a frequently cited\nillustration, he draws an analogy with milk which possesses both color\n(white) and taste (sweet). Without the influence of light, however, it\ncould not manifest itself or be perceived under the species of color\n(as white) without also manifesting itself under the species of taste\n(as sweet). Because of the influence of light one can speak of a kind\nof \u201cabstraction\u201d of the white from the sweet, although not in the\nsense that one would then exist apart from the other.\n So, too, in the order of consideration although not in the order\nof reality, the agent intellect separates or frees the quiddity\npresented in a phantasm from its individuating conditions and thereby\nreduces it from being potentially intelligible to being actually\nintelligible and capable of moving the possible intellect to\nunderstand. This freeing or abstracting process takes place because of\na kind of spiritual contact with the light of the agent intellect\n(Wippel, 1986). And, according to Godfrey the abstracted quiddity or\nintelligible object is really the efficient cause of the possible\nintellect\u2019s actual cognition of that object, just as the object of a\nsense power is the efficient cause of that sense power\u2019s actual\nperception of its object. In both cases this is again because nothing\ncan reduce itself from potency to act (Quodlibet VIII, q. 2, PB\n4.30\u201333; Quodlibet IX, q.19, PB 4.276\u201378; Quodlibet XIII,\nq. 3, PB 5.191\u201394, 200\u2013202; Wippel, 1981,194\u2013200;\nC\u00f4t\u00e9, 2007, especially on Quodlibet XII, q. 1; Hartman, 2014).\n12. Prime Matter\n\n\nGodfrey defends the matter-form composition of corporeal beings but\nrejects any kind of spiritual matter and therefore any matter-form\ncomposition of spiritual entities (Wippel, 2012). He also opposes the strong tendency\nwithin the Franciscan tradition, also promoted by Henry of Ghent, that\nwould assign some minimum degree of actuality to prime matter.\nAccording to Godfrey prime matter is pure potentiality and can never be\nkept in existence without some substantial form, not even by God. Prime\nmatter and substantial form are directly related to one another as\npotency principle and act principle. Neither is a being in its own\nright, but both are principles of one and the same composite entity\n(Quodlibet XIV, q. 5, PB 5.404\u201305).\n13. Unicity vs. Plurality of Substantial Form\n\n\nHeatedly debated in the 1270s and 1280s both at Paris and Oxford was\nthe question concerning whether there is one or more than one\nsubstantial form in one substance, and especially in a human being.\nGodfrey devotes considerable attention to this, especially in Quodlibet\nII of Easter, 1286 and then again in Quodlibet III of Christmas, 1286.\nThese dates are significant because alleged theological difficulties\nwith the theory of unicity of substantial form as advanced by Aquinas\nand others had led to prohibitions and condemnations of this by the\nArchbishop of Canterbury, Robert Kilwardby, O.P. on March 18, 1277, a\nreissuing of this by his successor in that see, John Pecham, O.F.M. in\n1284, and finally a new and resounding condemnation by Pecham on April\n30, 1286.\n\n\nIn Quodlibet II, q. 7 Godfrey considers three theories that defend\nplurality of forms in all material substances, or at least of duality\nof substantial forms in human beings (Henry of Ghent). Godfrey severely\ncriticizes all three theories. Most fundamental among his many\narguments against them is his conviction that a substantial form\nconfers substantial being upon a composite substance. Therefore, the\npresence of more than one substantial form in such a being would\nundermine its substantial unity. Already in this discussion Godfrey\naddresses alleged theological issues raised against unicity of\nsubstantial form, especially one concerning the continuing numerical\nidentity of Christ\u2019s body during the period between his death on Good\nFriday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. At this point Godfrey\u2019s\nphilosophical preference is for unicity of form in all material\nentities, including humans. He regards theories that defend plurality\nof forms in all material substances as more improbable, and Henry\u2019s\ntheory of duality of forms in human beings as less improbable. He\nmaintains that the theological question remains open to a defense\neither of unicity or of plurality of substantial forms.\n\n\nIn Quodlibet III, q. 5, after Pecham\u2019s condemnation of April, 1286,\nGodfrey examines the theological aspects of this issue in detail. Again\nhe insists on one\u2019s freedom, theologically speaking, to defend either\nunicity or plurality of forms in human beings, especially at Paris, but\ndoes not commit himself definitively to either side (PB 2.197\u2013211). In\nsum, when he is primarily concerned with the philosophical issues\ninvolved, he favors unicity of substantial form in all material\nsubstances. When discussing the theological issues, he is more hesitant\nand, without embracing either side in any definitive way, continues to\nargue for one\u2019s freedom to defend either side pending some future\ndecision by the Church (Wippel, 1981, pp, 321\u201347).\n14. The Principle of Individuation\n\n\nTogether with many of his contemporaries, Godfrey attempts to\nidentify the principle within material entities that accounts for their\nbeing multiplied numerically within species. In discussing this he\nreturns to the distinction he had drawn in Quodlibet VI, q. 16 between\nthe kind of unity which serves as a principle of number and which is\nbased on discrete quantity, and the kind that is convertible with\nbeing, transcendental unity. Because the substantial form is the\ndetermining principle within a corporeal entity and makes its essence\ncapable of being defined, Godfrey holds that it is by reason of its\nform that such a substance enjoys transcendental unity.\n\n\nNonetheless, in Quodlibet VII, q. 5 he comments that if different\nindividuals within the same species share in the same specific nature,\nthat nature cannot itself serve as the principle that renders them\nnumerically distinct from one another. Something else seems to be\nneeded, perhaps quantity. But to make quantity the principle of\nindividuation will not resolve the problem, for this would be to reduce\nthe principle that distinguishes one substance from others within the\nsame species to the level of an accident. Godfrey notes that in the\ncase of created immaterial beings (angels), their substantial form is\nalso that by which they are individuals. He proposes, therefore, that\nin corporeal substances it is also the substantial form that serves as\ntheir principle of individuation. Nonetheless, quantity has its role to\nplay as well since it is required in order to divide matter into\ndistinct parts and thereby enable it to receive and individuate\nsubstantial forms of the same kind. In other words, quantity disposes\nmatter so as to enable it to function as the material principle of\nindividuation. The formal cause or principle of a thing\u2019s individuation\nis its substantial form. Quantity is not the formal principle of\nindividuation, but by disposing matter so that it can receive different\nsubstantial forms, it may be described as a quasi-material disposing\ncause of individuation (Wippel, 1981, 349\u201364).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Godfrey", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Godfrey": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Godfrey of Fontaines. <em>Les Philosophes Belges</em>, Louvain:\nInstitut Sup\u00e9rieur de Philosophie de\nl\u2019Universit\u00e9. \n <ul class=\"subhang\">", "Vol. 2 (=PB 2): <em>Les quatres premiers Quodlibets de Godefroid\nde Fontaines</em> (1904), M.

While de Lagarde\u2019s early long article on\nhis political and social philosophy is dated, it is still\nuseful. Helpful on his views on the relationship between the\nindividual good and the common good (and many related topics) are\nchapters 8 and 9 in Kempshall, 1999. This should now be supplemented\nby Osborne, 2005, 139\u201350, and Osborne, 2015. All three studies offer important comparisons of\nGodfrey with other leading figures of his time. Marmursztejn (2006)\noffers many particular instances of Godfrey\u2019s thinking about various\npractical matters while developing her theme of different quodlibetal\nMasters\u2019 understanding of their role and their authority in\ndetermining disputed issues. Lambertini (2006) does much the same with\nrespect to Godfrey\u2019s positions and those of several other Masters\nconcerning a number of political issues in their respective\nQuodlibetal disputations. Knuuttila (2016) briefly explains Godfrey\u2019s explanation of how one who loves oneself may love the common good or love God more than oneself and compares this with the view of Henry of Ghent. </p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>Aiello, A. and R.
