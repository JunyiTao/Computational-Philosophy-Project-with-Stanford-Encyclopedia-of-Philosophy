    "main_text": "A General Argument for Internalism\n8. A General Argument for Internalism\n\nA general argument for accessibility internalism has been proposed on\nbehalf of the internalist, and this reconstructed argument has the\nmerit of being extendable to mentalism (Goldman 1999; note that\nGoldman is well-known for defending externalism and is thus no friend\nof internalism). Internalists often adopt a specific deontological\nposition, namely a \u201cbelief-guidance\u201d position, or a\nguidance deontological concept (GD concept). The idea behind\nGD is that one ought to guide the formation of one's beliefs by the\namount and strength of the evidence one has on hand, and this\ncertainly has a deontological ring to it. This guidance theme is\nslightly different from what we have identified as the deontological\nconcept of justification, for that is a thesis about what \u2018being\nepistemically justified\u2019 means. The GD conception, on the other\nhand, is a thesis about how a person ought to go about forming her\nbeliefs. With this distinction drawn, the general argument for\ninternalism is straightforward:\n\n\nThe guidance-deontological (GD) conception of justification is\nposited.\nA certain constraint on the determiners of justification is\nderived from the GD conception, that is, the constraint that all\njustification determiners must be accessible to, or knowable by, the\nepistemic agent.\nThe accessibility or knowability constraint is taken to imply that\nonly internal conditions qualify as legitimate determiners of\njustification. So, justification must be a purely internal affair.\n(Goldman 1999, 207-208.)\n\n\n\nIn the terms that have been used in this paper, what is gestured\ntoward in step (3) by saying that \u201cjustification must be a\npurely internal affair\u201d is just mentalism as we have construed\nit. And plainly a form of accessibility internalism is what is being\nnoted in (2), though this argument does not distinguish between\nwhether all or only some of the justifiers (determiners) are to be\naccessible. The inference from (2) to (3), however, certainly seems to\nsuppose that accessibility internalism implies mentalism, a move that\nwas found questionable earlier in this article.\n\nThe point about complete justifier accounts matters for the evaluation\nof this argument for internalism. As we noted earlier, complete\njustifier accounts of accessibility internalism provide strong support\nfor mentalism. If complete justifier accounts were considered, premise\n(3) would have some ring of plausibility. However, we have seen,\ncomplete justifier versions of accessibility internalism are too\nstrong; and, partial justifier accounts considerably weaken the\nsupport for mentalism. Considering premise (3) in the light of\npartial justifier accounts of accessibility, we would have to\nsay at once that (3) is false. Partial justifier accounts do not even\nprovide strong support for mentalism, let alone imply it.\n\nThere is also a problem with premise (1), concerning the GD conception\nof justification. While it is true that some philosophers who have\naccepted internalism, of either the accessibility or mentalist forms,\nhave also accepted this GD conception, they need not\ndo so. Indeed, some leading internalists explicitly reject the GD\nconception and any deontological concept that is proposed as an\nanalysis of the concept of justification, and yet this fact has no\neffect on their one important form of internalism, namely mentalism\n(Conee and Feldman 2001). These comments reinforce the comments made\nearlier to the effect that the deontological concept of justification\nis really independent of accessibility internalism and mentalism.\n\nIf accessibility internalism is not to be defended by means of\nsomething like the general argument presented here, then it is most\nlikely one would have to fall back on the arguments given earlier\nconcerning either actually justifying a belief or being capable of\njustifying that belief. As we saw, those arguments break down, thereby\nleaving accessibility internalism wholly unsupported.\n\nThere is another argument for access internalism, one which stresses\nhaving reasons. This argument is presented as a case against\nexternalist accounts of justification and it utilizes examples of\nsubjects who are clairvoyant. In one such example we have a person,\nNorman, who arrives at his belief that the President is in New York\nCity through some clairvoyance process, and we may presume that this\nbelief is true. Norman's exercise of clairvoyance may generally yield\ntrue beliefs in Norman, not just about the President's whereabouts,\nand so clairvoyance, for him, is a reliable belief-forming process,\nand the externalist would have to count Norman's belief about the\nPresident's location as justified. Even so, one can plausibly say,\nNorman is irrational in \u201caccepting beliefs whose provenance can\nonly be a total mystery to [him], whose status is as far as [he] can\ntell no different from that of a stray hunch or arbitrary\nconviction\u201d (BonJour and Sosa 2003, 32; quoted in Bergmann 2006,\n12)\n\nWhat would make the cognizer's belief rational would be if he or she\nwere to have good reasons for holding the believed proposition to be\ntrue. The cognizer may well have reasons for a belief, and these\nreasons may provide some measure of justification for that belief. If\nand maybe only if, the cognizer also has has some awareness of these\njustifying reasons, or the capacity to have such awareness of these\nreasons, will she have some reason to believe the believed proposition\nis true. So, we could conclude that access internalism is quite\nplausible after all, because it is quite plausible to maintain that a\nperson's justification for a belief depends squarely on having reasons\nto believe that the believed proposition is true. Possession of these\nreasons would insure that the belief is not merely a \"stray\nhunch.\"\n\nThe argument about having reasons for belief is thus both an argument\nagainst externalism, and also strong support for endorsing access\ninternalism. If we focus just on that aspect of this argument that is\naimed at externalism, we have what has been called the\n\u2018Subject's Perspective Objection\u2019 (SPO), viz.,\n\nIf the subject holding a belief isn't aware of what that belief has\ngoing for it, then she isn't aware of how its status is any different\nfrom a stray hunch or an arbitrary conviction. From that we may\nconclude that from her perspective it is an accident that her belief\nis true. And that implies that it isn't a justified belief. (Bergmann\n2006, 12)\n\n\nNevertheless, despite the great intuitive appeal of the SPO, and the\nsupport it provides for access internalism, a dilemmatic argument may\namount to an insurmountable obstacle for any form of access\ninternalism (Bergmann 2006).\n\nThis dilemmatic argument starts by distinguishing between\nnonconceptual awareness in which no concept is applied and no judgment\nmade; and strong awareness, which is conceptual. Strong awareness\ninvolves a knowing that or justifiably believing that something is the\ncase. We can adapt this distinction to the two cases of access\ninternalism distinguished earlier, namely weak and strong AJI. To do\nthis we presume that the awareness spoken of in weak AJI is weak,\nnon-conceptual awareness, and that the awareness noted in strong AJI\nis strong awareness. Then, the dillema for the access internalist, so\nadapted, is this: If the access internalist requires strong awareness\nas in strong AJI, then her position will lead to an infinite regress.\nIf, on the other hand, the access internalist settles for\nnon-conceptual awareness, as in weak AJI, then her position will fall\nprey to the SPO, thus undercutting the best case for access\ninternalism. Thus, access internalism should be rejected.\n\nThis dilemma argument can be aimed at both actual and potential\ninternalism awareness, as well as how those might be aligned with\neither propositional or doxastic justification (Bergmann 2006, chap.\n1). Here we will cover just potential awareness aligned with doxastic\njustification; that should be enough to show the strength of the\ndilemma argument.\n\nIf the access internalism understands awareness as non-conceptual\nawareness, then being aware of a justifier would be an event in which\nno concept is applied and no belief is acquired or judgment made. In\nthat case, the event of being aware of the justifier would be no\ndifferent from the cognizer's point of view from an event such as\nbelief acquisition by means of a reliable process. Thus, from that\ncognizer's standpoint, her true belief would be no more than a \"stray\nhunch or arbitrary conviction.\" In this way, the SPO would itself have\nforce against access internalism, rather than help to provide support\nand motivation for access internalism.\n\nGiven this result, the access internalist should, and no doubt would,\nopt for strong awareness, encapsulated here in strong AJI. Then, if a\ncognizer has a justified belief that p, she will be capable of\nknowing that, and so justifiably believing that there is some item\nj that is a justifier for her belief that p. In turn,\nthis will require that she be capable of knowing that, and thus\njustifiably believing that there is some item, j1,\nthat is a justifier for her belief that j is a justifier for\nher belief that p. Then her belief that j1 is\nthis sort of justifier will require that she be capable of knowing\nthat, and so justifiably believing that there is an item,\nj2, that is a justifier for her belief that\nj1 is a justifier for her belief that j is a\njustifier for her belief that p. This will then require that\nshe be capable of knowing that, and so justifiably believing that,\nthere is an item, j3, and so on to infinity. In\norder to have a single justified belief, the cognizer would have to be\ncapable of having an infinite number of further beliefs concerning\njustifiers. (Bergmann 2006; Wedgwood 2002, 352, gives a similar\nargument, though aimed at rational belief.)\n\nThis argument may be taken to show that strong AJI, making use of\nstrong awareness, leads to scepticism. More importantly, the argument\nshows that strong AJI requires that a cognizer with a justified belief\nbe capable of holding justified beliefs of \"ever increasing\ncomplexity\" (Bergmann 2006, p. 16) and this is psychologically\nunrealistic, maybe even psychologically impossible. So, strong AJI\nshould be rejected as untenable. Hence, access internalism is\nimplausible and should be rejected, because neither its weak nor its\nstrong form is acceptable.\n\nThere is a response to the dilemma argument, one that raises\nadditional interesting issues. We focus first on a case of a basic\nbelief. A person has in her visual field a green triangular shape;\nthis is what she experiences. The green triangular shape is the\nexperiential element, and the awareness this cognizer has of that\nelement is \"non-propositional and non-conceptual\" (BonJour 2006, 744).\nIt thus involves no belief or judgment, and no issue of justification\narises for this awareness. In such circumstances, a cognizer will\noften form a belief that there is a green triangular shape in her\nvisual field. The idea is that first the cognizer will entertain the\npropositional claim that there is a green triangular shape in the\nvisual field, and merely by entertaining this propositional claim she\ndoes not thereby have a belief. Rather, she comes to have a belief\nonce she accepts the propositional claim. This point concerning the\ntransition from merely entertaining the propositional claim to\nactually believing it, interesting though it may be, is one that will\nnot figure in the argument as given here.\n\nThere is a third element to be considered, namely the cognizer's\ndirect awareness of \"fit\" between the experiential element and the\npropositional claim. The point can be put this way:\n\nWhat is required \u2026 is that I recognize or apprehend the fit or\nagreement between the two sorts of content. Part of what this requires\nis picking out or noticing the particular experiential element that is\nrelevant. But in addition, having done this, I must also grasp or\nrecognize the agreement between the experiential element and the\nconceptual description embodied in the propositional claim. (BonJour,\n2006: 744)\n\n\nThe general thought is not that the experience of the experiential\nelement by itself justifies the belief in the propositional claim.\nWhat, though, of a position in which the direct awareness of the fit\nor agreement between the two elements does all of the justificatory\nwork? On this account, the experience of the experiential element\ntaken together with the belief in the propositional claim and the fact\nthat there is the relevant fit between these two elements \u2013 all\nof these things taken together provide no justification for the\nbelief. It is only when the cognizer directly recognizes the relevant\nfit that her belief about the green triangular shape is justified.\n\nThe problem with this interpretation of the argument in response to\nthe dilemma argument is that it would not count as a version of access\ninternalism. The reason should be clear: on the above described\naccount, the cognizer is not aware of any justifiers. So it seems best\nto understand this line of argument to be saying this: the fact that\nthe cognizer has the relevant experience of the green traingular\nshape, plus the fact the fact that there is a fit or agreement between\nthe experiential element and the propositional claim provides some\njustification for the belief in that proposition; and the direct\nrecognition of fit or agreement between those elements serves to\nenhance that degree of justification. In this way, the cognizer will\naccess some justifiers when she directly recognizes a fit or agreement\nbetween the experiential element and the propositional claim.\n(Bergmann 2006, 35-36, offers a similar interpretation, though he\nspeaks of contributors to justification rather than justifiers.)\n\nThus the general idea is that this account of the justification of a\nbasic belief avoids the dilemma argument. Part of the reason for\nthinking this is that direct recognition of fit between the\nexperiential element and the propositional claim \"\u2026grows out of\n[my] awareness of the content of the claim and of the corresponding\nexperience. To be sure, I must recognize the fit between the two, but\nthis recognition is not a further, cognitively independent judgment,\nwhich would then require further independent justification, but is\ninstead cognitively guided by and based on those experiences\nthemselves\" (BonJour 2006, 745-46). Another reason the regress is\navoided, according to BonJour, is that the direct recognition of fit\nis not strong awareness, something that is needed to initiate and fuel\nthe regress in the dilemma argument.\n\nPhilosophers who have discussed basic beliefs have often noted that no\nspecial evidence or reasons are needed beyond the having of the\nrelevant experience in order for the belief to count as justified. In\neffect, the response to the dilemma argument is telling us why this is\nis or may be the case. It is not, on this account, because the\nexperience alone justifies the belief, but rather because the\nexperience and the fact that there is a fit between the experiential\ncontent and the proposition believed enables the cognizer to recognize\nthe fit between those elements. This enabling is likely what is meant\nby saying that the direct recognition of fit \"grows out of\" the\nexperience. In that sense, no additional evidence or reasons are\nneeded to effect the justification, and so the regress does not\nbegin.\n\nThat leaves the direct recognition of fit. We know the regress will\nthreaten if direct recognition of fit is strong awareness. Weak\nawareness will not help, because that will lead straight back to the\nSPO, and in any case weak awareness is ruled out as not what is needed\n(BonJour 2003, 747). So, direct recognition of fit must be some form\nof awareness that is, so to speak, intermediate between weak and\nstrong awareness. It is something with some conceptual content, but\ndoes not collapse into strong awareness as one might be inclined to\nthink (Bergmann 2006, 35-38). Perhaps the best conclusion to draw at\nthis point is that this intriguing idea of a direct recognition of\nfit, if further developed and clarified, together with the point about\nenabling made above, will suffice to block the regress in the dilemma\nargument. Without that further clarification and development which\nwould differentiate recognition of fit from strong awareness, however,\nthe dilemma argument would seem to have full force against access\ninternalism.\n",
