    "main_text": "The Soul, Theurgy and Religion || Soul and embodiment\n6.2 Soul and embodiment\n\nIt is fair to say that Iamblichus\u2014in this respect closer to\nPorphyry\u2014focuses more closely than Plotinus on the soul\u2019s\nindwelling within the body and on the actions it performs alongside\nit. In what remains of his treatise On the Soul, he reviews\nall sorts of historical theses about the composition, powers and\nactivities of the soul, and does not hesitate to engage his\nNeoplatonic predecessors.\n\nIn the available testimonies (Priscian in particular: see the\nassessment in Huby 1993), the soul is constantly associated with the\nnotion of \u201clife\u201d. The latter is approached here not so\nmuch as an essential psychic property (as had been the case in the\nPhaedo), as in terms of the corporeal\n\u201clife-principles\u201d (z\u014dai, most often in the\nplural) that the soul is said to project outside of itself in order to\nget a hold on the external world:\n\n\ninsofar as it puts forth other levels of life that incline towards\ngeneration and consort with the body, thus far (soul) is involved in\nthe order of the cosmos (Letter to Macedonius, apud\nStobaeus, Anthology II, 8, 45 [DP-2009: 25]).\n\n\nIn this manner, psychic activities that involve a relationship with\nexternal objects (such as sense-perception) presuppose a dialectic\nrelationship between the soul\u2019s essence and the multiplicity of\npowers it deploys: the individual and immaterial entity\n\u201csoul\u201d goes out of itself to grasp enmattered items,\nbefore going back (literally \u201cconverting\u201d,\nepistrephein) in order to compare the data thus aggregated to\n(stable) Forms, which lend it intelligibility. As a result,\n\n\nthe particular soul, as being in the middle of all the kinds of things\nof this world, and being divided together with them and being\nmultiplied along with them, not only remains but also changes, living\nthrough so many partial lives. And not only with regard to its\ndispositions, but also with regard to its substance it changes\nsomewhat. (Priscian, Metaphrasis 32.15\u201319 [trans. Huby\n1993: 8])\n\n\nImagination, being torn between sensibility and abstract intellection,\nwhose difference it helps bridge, functions in a similar way and\ncontributes to making the soul the median entity par\nexcellence.\n\nSensibility, then, would seem to be proof of the soul\u2019s radical\ninability to remain in itself, as opposed to the intellect, which is\nimmobile and in actuality by its own nature (another sign of the fact\nthat the unity of the soul is no longer considered self-evident is the\nintroduction of the so-called \u201cvehicle\u201d of the soul, a\nspiritual garment that acts as an interface between the soul and\nbodies: on this subject, cf. Finamore 1985). What stands out as most\nremarkable is the notion that the soul\u2019s essence is also\nchallenged in the course of sensitive acts. Iamblichus here inherits\nthe Aristotelian terminology of Essence/Substance\n(ousia)\u2014Power (dynamis)\u2014Activity\n(energeia) (see LCH-2022): a single essence\u2014say,\nthe human soul\u2014acts as a substratum for a plurality of powers\n(sensitive, intellective, imaginative, etc.), and those powers are in\nturn actualized in a greater plurality of activities\n(sense-perception, aisth\u0113sis, of x, y,\nor z; intellection, no\u0113sis, about x,\ny, or z). These three terms are hierarchised,\ninsofar as the soul can remain inactive: but in Aristotle, this\nhierarchy remains largely implicit, contrary to Iamblichus and his\nunequivocal conception of vertical causality (see above,\n Section 3.5).\n In applying his own principles, Iamblichus argues that, since the\neffect is nothing outside of its cause, any flaw connatural to the\neffect would also have to be preassumed in the cause. Since, then, the\nsoul\u2019s activities show instability and imperfection,\nthis inability to act consistently and permanently points to a break\nin its very essence (cf. De anima sect. C [DF-2002]\n= pseudo-Simplicius, In De anima 89.33\u201335).\n\nThis is Iamblichus\u2019 notion of the \u201cchanging self\u201d,\nas first expounded by Steel 1978. Such a conception of the human soul\nrepresents a major break in the Platonic tradition, which until then\nhad been prone to emphasize the soul\u2019s inner dignity and\ndivinity: on the other hand, it is a very convenient way to account\nfor human fallibility. One could interpret it as a literal exegesis of\nTimaeus 35A: the Demiurge creates the soul\u2019s essence as\na mix of indivisible and divisible Being, so that\u2014one might\nthink\u2014it is no more indivisible than it is divisible. By the\nsame reasoning, Iamblichus concludes that the soul is at the same time\nchanging and unchanging, dying and undying. This, at least, is what\ncharacterizes \u201cparticular\u201d souls (merikai or\nen merei: a terminology propagated by Iamblichus\u2014see\nReply to Porphyry V, 2 [SS-2013: 149.26]\u2014before it\nbecame usual in later authors). The case of divine souls is less\nclear-cut, since they are able to mend the gap between essence and\nactivity (De anima sect. 20\u201321; see also 18). It is\nunclear whether\u2014and how\u2014this picture can be reconciled\nwith Iamblichus\u2019 allusions to \u201ctwo souls\u201d, one\noriginating in the intelligible, the other given to us by celestial\ninfluences (Reply to Porphyry VIII, 6 [SS-2013:\n199.1\u201312]).\n",
