    "main_text": "Ordering the Bureaucracy || Recruitment and Promotion: The fa Model of Meritocracy\n4.1 Recruitment and Promotion: The fa Model of Meritocracy\n\nOne of the primary issues that the rulers of the Warring States faced\nwas that of recruitment into government service. During the\naristocratic Springs-and-Autumns period, the overwhelming majority of\nofficials were scions of hereditary ministerial lineages; only\nexceptionally could outsiders join the government. This situation\nchanged by the end of the fifth century BCE, as aristocratic lineages\nwere largely eliminated in internecine struggles and members of lower\nnobility\u2014the so-called \u201cmen of service,\u201d\nshi \u58eb\u2014could advance up the ladder of\nofficialdom. It was then that the new meritocratic discourse of\n\u201celevating the worthy\u201d (shang xian\n\u5c1a\u8ce2) proliferated and upward social mobility became\nlegitimate (Pines 2013c). Yet who were the \u201cworthy\u201d and\nhow to determine one\u2019s worth was a matter of considerable\nuncertainty and confusion.\n\nOne model was proposed by Confucians. It was a bottom-up model.\nOne\u2019s worth as a \u201cnoble man\u201d was primarily\ndetermined by one\u2019s morality; and those who could judge this\nmorality were one\u2019s peers. In practice, it meant that the ruler\nshould heed the elite opinion and appoint persons who gained renown\nfor their moral qualities. For the fa thinkers, this was a\ndangerous delusion. In their eyes, the vagueness of the\n\u201cworth\u201d definition was deliberately built into the\nConfucian model to open career opportunities for the good-for-nothing\ntalkers. The Book of Lord Shang clarifies:\n\n\nWhat the world calls a \u201cworthy\u201d is one who is defined as\nupright; but those who define him as good and upright are his\npartisans. When you hear his words, you consider him able; when you\nask his partisans, they approve it. Hence, one is ennobled before one\nhas any merits; one is punished before one has committed a crime.\n(Book of Lord Shang 25.1, \u201cAttention to law\u201d)\n\n\nThe author perceptively identifies the problem of PR campaigns in\nwhich the appointee\u2019s ability and worth are determined by his\nreputation, which, in turn, is manufactured by his partisans (or a\n\u201cclique,\u201d dang \u9ee8). The result is\nproliferation of fake worthies. This proliferation becomes possible\nbecause the ruler can easily be manipulated and misled by those who\nhide their selfishness behind lofty pronouncements. Shen Dao further\nwarns the ruler that if he decides on promotions and demotions on the\nbasis of his personal impression, this will cause inflated\nexpectations or excessive resentment among his servants:\n\n\nWhen the ruler abandons the standard (fa) and relies on\nhimself to govern, then punishments and rewards, recruitment and\ndemotion all arise out of the ruler\u2019s heart. If this is the\ncase, then even if rewards are appropriate, the expectations are\ninsatiable; even if the punishments are appropriate, lenience is\nsought ceaselessly. If the ruler abandons the standard and relies on\nhis heart to decide upon the degree [of awards and punishments], then\nidentical merits will be rewarded differently, and identical crimes\nwill be punished differently. It is from this that resentment arises.\n(Harris 2016: 120)\n\n\nTo avoid mistakes, to screen off false worthies, and to avoid\nresentment, the ruler should never rely on his own judgments. Instead,\npromotion and demotion should be based on impersonal standards only.\nHan Fei clarifies:\n\n\nThus, as for the officials of an enlightened ruler: chief ministers\nand chancellors must rise from among local officials; valiant generals\nmust rise from among the ranks. One who has merit should be awarded:\nthen ranks and emoluments are bountiful and they are ever more\nencouraging. One who is promoted and ascends to higher positions, his\nofficial responsibilities increase, and he performs his tasks ever\nmore orderly. When ranks and emoluments are great, while official\nresponsibilities are well ordered \u2014this is the Way of the [True]\nMonarch. (Han Feizi 50.5, \u201cIllustrious\nTeachings\u201d)\n\n\nHan Fei proposes a meritocratic system that would not depend on the\nvague notion of \u201cworthiness\u201d but will function according\nto objective criteria of merit. Administrative and military officials\nwill be promoted from the lower ranks of the bureaucracy and the army;\nthey will be judged according to their performance, and, if\nsuccessful, given ever more important offices. While the system is far\nfrom perfect (it does not explain how the people will join the\nadministrative apparatus in the first place), it is much more\nsophisticated than anything proposed in other Warring States-period\ntexts. It bears clear resemblance to the rules of promotion in such\nmodern meritocratic systems as the army or academia. And it is the\nsystem most readily associated with the current state of affairs in\nthe People\u2019s Republic of\n China.[2]\n",
