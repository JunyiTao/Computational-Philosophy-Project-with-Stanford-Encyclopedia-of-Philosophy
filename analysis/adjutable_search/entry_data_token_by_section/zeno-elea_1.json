    "main_text": "The Extant Paradoxes\n2. The Extant Paradoxes\n\n\nThe task of reconstructing Zeno\u2019s arguments is sometimes \ninsufficiently distinguished from the task of developing responses to\nthem. How one reconstructs Zeno\u2019s reasoning certainly determines to \nsome extent what will constitute an effective response. The danger is\nthat one\u2019s idea of how to formulate an effective response may affect \none\u2019s reconstruction of Zeno\u2019s actual reasoning, particularly if one \nimports into his arguments concepts more developed or precise than \nthe ones with which he was actually operating. In some cases, as with\nthe one called the Achilles, the paradox\u2019s power derives to a \nsignificant extent from the very simplicity of the notions it \ndeploys. The reconstructions provided here therefore aim to preserve \nsomething of the manner of Zeno\u2019s own argumentation as we know it \nfrom verbatim quotation of at least portions of some of the preserved\nparadoxes. More formal reconstructions are possible and available. As\nalready noted, at least one effort at improving Zeno\u2019s argumentation \nwas already known to Aristotle. But such efforts can come at the cost\nof historical accuracy, which is the primary goal of this article. \nHow it might be possible to improve Zeno\u2019s arguments will be left to \nothers. Since it is also essential to appreciate just how much (or \nhow little) we know of Zeno\u2019s arguments, the primary evidence for \neach major argument is presented along with a reconstruction.\n",
