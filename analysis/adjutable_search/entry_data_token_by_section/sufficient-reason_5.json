    "main_text": "Leibniz || Applications\n3.3 Applications\n\nLeibniz says that PSR is needed if we are to go beyond mathematics to\nmetaphysics and natural science. How does the PSR help in those\ndomains of inquiry? There is a general pattern of argument that\nLeibniz uses to establish conclusions using the PSR. First, he assumes\nthe falsity of what he wants to prove. Call the proposition to be\nproved \\(p\\). Then he tries to show that if \\(p\\) were\nfalse, there would be some fact or truth for which there could not be\nsufficient reason. But by the PSR, there is no such fact or truth.\nTherefore, \\(p\\) is true. Leibniz uses this template to argue for\na number of claims, including the indefinite extension of space\n(Labyrinth of the Continuum, 233), determinism\n(Leibniz-Stahl Controversy, 17), the impossibility of bare\noccult qualities and bare faculties (Philosophical Writings,\n172\u20133), the identity of indiscernibles, relationalism with\nrespect to space and time, and the existence of God. Let us briefly\nlook at how Leibniz uses the PSR to argue for each of the last three\ntheses.\n\nLeibniz presents arguments for the existence of God from the PSR in a\nnumber of different places (for example, The Ultimate Origination\nof Things, G VII 302\u20133; L 486\u20138. Monadology\n\u00a737). Suppose that God does not exist. If God does not exist,\nthen the only things that exist are contingent beings. Would the\nentire series of contingent things have an explanation? The\nexplanation of the entire series cannot be a member of the series\nsince then it would explain itself and no contingent thing is\nself-explanatory. But the explanation cannot be outside of the series\nbecause we have assumed that there is no non-contingent being, i.e.,\nGod. Thus if God did not exist, there would be something unexplained:\nthe series of contingent beings. Everything has an explanation.\nTherefore God exists (notice, the similarity to the argument for\nGod\u2019s existence Spinoza cites in the name of Crescas which we\nhave just discussed at the end of \u00a72 above. In fact, this proof\nby Leibniz appears in a 1676 gloss to his copy of Spinoza\u2019s\nletter discussing Crescas\u2019 proof. See Leibniz, The Labyrinth\nof the Continuum, 117).\n\nLeibniz also thinks that the PSR rules out the possibility that there\ncould be two or more indistinguishable, that is, indiscernible, things\n(A VI, iv, 1541/AG 42). If there were two such things, God would have\ntreated them differently insofar as he has related them differently to\nthe rest of the world. For example, if there were two blades of grass\nthat were indiscernible from each other, then one blade would stand in\nspatial and temporal relation \\(R\\) to the rest of the world,\nwhereas the other blade would stand in some other spatial and temporal\nrelation \\(R'\\) to the rest of the world. Why did God\nchoose to put the first blade relation \\(R\\) to the rest of the\nworld instead of \\(R'\\)? Leibniz claims that since they are\nindiscernible from each other, there could be no reason for\nGod to treat them differently. Thus if there were two indiscernible\nindividuals, then God would have acted for no reason. But there is a\nreason for everything. So, there are no indiscernible yet numerically\ndistinct things.\n\nFor similar reasons, Leibniz thinks that space and time cannot be\nsubstances or anything else absolute and must ultimately be a system\nof relations that obtain between bodies (e.g., LC, L, 3.5). This is\nbecause if space, for example, were absolute, then there would be\nspace points that were indiscernible from one another. God would treat\nthese space points differently from each other insofar as he orients\nhis creation in space one way rather than another. This would have to\nbe an arbitrary decision for the reasons outlined above. So, space and\ntime are not absolute (see Lin 2011).\n\nNext to the PSR, Leibniz also holds a complimentary principle\naccording to which nothing is without effects, or \u201cnothing is\nsterile\u201d (see, for example, Monadology \u00a769 and AG 38).\n",
