    "main_text": "Philosophical Views || The Metaphysics of the Higher Realms\n3.3 The Metaphysics of the Higher Realms\n\nThe hierarchy of hypostases the One, Intellect and Soul has already\nbeen sketched. Given the available texts with certainty attributable\nto Porphyry, in particular the Sententiae, there would be no\nstrong reason for supposing Porphyry\u2019s metaphysics to differ\nsignificantly from that of Plotinus, though he does not always follow\nhis vocabulary. Furthermore, Porphyry has a different and more\nAristotelian conception of the branches of philosophy than Plotinus,\nwho claims dialectic as the supreme philosophical method (Hadot 1966;\nStrange 2007; cf. Plotinus, Ennead I. 3). This different\nconception is shown, for instance, in his arrangement of\nPlotinus\u2019 treatises which follows a pattern of ethics, physics,\npsychology, and ontology.\n\nAs mentioned above, Hadot (1968) made a case for identifying Porphyry\nas the author of the so-called Anonymous commentary on Plato\u2019s\nParmenides. The late ancient author of this commentary,\nextant in mere fragments, takes the Parmenides to present\nPlato\u2019s ontological view. The commentary employs a notion of the\nOne as an ineffable first principle that according to Hadot makes it\npost-Plotinian. However, in the commentary the distinction between the\nfirst and the second hypostasis is somewhat blurred: the ineffable One\nis somehow also at the same time the first member\n(\u201cFather\u201d) in a triad of being, life and intelligence and\nin this context identical with being. Positing a first principle that\nis a part of such a composite is surely un-Plotinian. If Hadot\u2019s\nidentification of the author with Porphyry is right, Porphyry indeed\nheld metaphysical views that differ significantly from those of\nPlotinus. However, even if Hadot\u2019s hypothesis about Porphyry as\nthe author of the commentary quickly won wide acceptance, in later\nyears it has suffered several blows at the hands of scholars with the\nresult that it must be considered highly questionable (see, e.g.,\nEdwards 1990, Bechtle 1999, Corrigan 2000, Rasimus 2011). The\ndiscovery that most of the supposedly Porphyrian characteristics of\nthe Parmenides commentary are to be found in pre-Porphyrian\nGnostic texts (unavailable to Hadot in the 1960s) seems especially\ntroublesome for Hadot\u2019s thesis (see Rasimus 2011).\nPorphyry\u2019s authorship has, however, been recently defended by\nChiaradonna (2014). Smith (1987, 2007), though unwilling to assert\nPorphyry as the author, holds that it comes from his circle and,\nhence, is definitely post-Plotinian.\n",
