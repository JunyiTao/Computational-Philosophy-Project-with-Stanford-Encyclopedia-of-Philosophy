Hippasus was probably from\nMetapontum (Aristotle, Metaph. 984a7; Diogenes Laertius VIII\n84), although Iamblichus says there was controversy as to whether he\nwas from Metapontum or Croton (VP 81), and he is listed under\nSybaris in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue (VP 267). He is\nconsistently portrayed as a rebel in the Pythagorean tradition, in one\ncase a democratic rebel who challenged the aristocratic Pythagorean\nleadership in Croton (Iamb. VP 257), but more commonly as the\nthinker who initiated Pythagorean study of mathematics and the natural\nworld.\n\nIt is in this latter role that he is connected with the split between\ntwo groups in ancient Pythagoreanism, the acusmatici (who\nemphasized rules for living one\u2019s life, including various\ntaboos) and the math\u00eamatici (who emphasized study of\nmathematics and the natural world). Each group claimed to be the true\nPythagoreans. Our knowledge of this split comes from Iamblichus, who\nunfortunately presents two contradictory versions, with the result\nthat Hippasus is sometimes said to be one of the\nmath\u00eamatici and sometimes one of the\nacusmatici. Burkert has convincingly shown that the correct\nversion is that reported by Iamblichus at De Communi Mathematica\nScientia 76.19 ff. (1972a, 192 ff.). According to this account,\nthe acusmatici denied that the math\u00eamatici\nwere Pythagoreans at all, saying that their philosophy derived from\nHippasus instead. The math\u00eamatici for their part, while\nrecognizing that the acusmatici were Pythagoreans of a sort,\nargued that they themselves were Pythagoreans in a truer sense.\nHippasus\u2019 supposed innovations, they said, were in fact\nplagiarisms from Pythagoras himself. The math\u00eamatici\nexplained that, upon Pythagoras\u2019 arrival in Italy, the leading\nmen in the cities did not have time to learn the sciences and the\nproofs of what Pythagoras said, so that Pythagoras just gave them\ninstructions on how to act, without explaining the reasons. The\nyounger men, who did have the leisure to devote to study, learned the\nmathematical sciences and the proofs. The former group were the first\nacusmatici, who learned the oral instructions of Pythagoras\non how to live (the acusmata = \u201cthings heard\u201d),\nwhile the latter group were the first math\u00eamatici.\nHippasus was thus closely connected to the math\u00eamatici\nin this split in Pythagoreanism but ended up being disavowed by both\nsides. For an attempt to further characterize the\nmath\u00eamatici see Horky 2013.\n\nIt is difficult to be sure of Hippasus\u2019 dates, but he is\ntypically regarded as active in the first half of the fifth century\nand perhaps early in that period (Burkert 1972a, 206; Zhmud 2012a,\n124\u2013125). The split in Pythagoreanism may have occurred after\nthe main period of his work and was perhaps connected to the attacks\non the Pythagorean societies by outsiders around 450 BCE (Burkert\n1972a, 207), but certainty is not possible. Zhmud (2012a,\n169\u2013192) has argued that the split is an invention of the later\ntradition, appearing first in Clement of Alexandria and disappearing\nafter Iamblichus. He also notes that the term  acusmata\nappears first in Iamblichus (On the Pythagorean Life\n82\u201386) and suggests that it also is a creation of the later\ntradition. He admits that the Pythagorean maxims did exist earlier, as\nthe testimony of Aristotle shows, but they were known as\nsymbola, were originally very few in number and were mainly a\nliterary phenomenon rather than being tied to people who actually\npracticed them (Zhmud 2012a, 192\u2013195). The consensus view, which\naccepts the split, is based on Burkert\u2019s argument that\nIamblichus\u2019account of the split between the acusmatici\nand math\u00eamatici can be shown to be derived from\nAristotle (1972a, 196). Burkert later reaffirmed this position,\nalthough with a little less confidence, asserting that the\nAristotelian provenance of the text is \u201cas obvious as it is\nunprovable\u201d (1998, 315). Indeed the description of the split in\nwhat is likely to be the original version (Iamblichus, On General\nMathematical Science 76.16\u201377.18) uses language in\ndescribing the Pythagoreans that is almost an Aristotelian signature,\n\u201cThere are two forms of the Italian philosophy which is called\nPythagorean\u201d (76.16). Aristotle famously describes the\nPythagoreans as \u201cthose called Pythagoreans\u201d and also as\n\u201cthe Italians\u201d (e.g., Mete. 342b30,\nCael. 293a20). Thus, Aristotle remains the most likely\nsource. Zhmud also argues against the split on the grounds that there\nare no individuals in the historical record that can be confidently\nidentified as acusmatici. Since the acusmatici were\nneither original nor full-time philosophers, however, and simply\npreserved the oral taboos handed down by Pythagoras, it is not\nsurprising that they are not singled out for attention in the sources.\nOnly a relatively small number of the names in Iamblichus\u2019\ncatalogue can certainly be identified as math\u00eamatici\nand most of the others, particularly the 145 individuals whose names\nare only known from the catalogue, are likely to be\nacusmatici, who to a greater or lesser degree followed the\nPythagorean acusmata, but left no other trace of their\nactivity. In addition, a number of other Pythagoreans of the fifth and\nfourth century, who figure in anecdotes about the Pythagorean life are\nlikely to be acusmatici (see below). \n\nHippasus is the first figure in the Pythagorean tradition who can with\nsome confidence be identified as a natural philosopher, mathematician\nand music theorist. His connections are as much with figures outside\nthe Pythagorean tradition as those within it. This independence may\nexplain why neither Aristotle nor the doxographical tradition label\nhim a Pythagorean, but he is too deeply embedded in the traditions\nabout early Pythagoreanism for there to be any doubt that he was in\nsome sense a Pythagorean. Aristotle pairs Hippasus with Heraclitus as\npositing fire as the primary element (Metaph. 984a7) and this\npairing is repeated in the doxography that descends from Theophrastus\n(DK I 109. 5\u201316), according to which Hippasus also said that the\nsoul was made of fire. Philolaus, who was probably two generations\nlater than Hippasus, might have been influenced by Hippasus in\nstarting his cosmology with the central fire (Fr. 7). For Philolaus,\nhowever, the central fire is a compound of limiter and unlimited,\nwhereas Hippasus is presented as a monist and does not start from\nPhilolaus\u2019 fundamental opposition between limiters and\nunlimiteds.\n\nThere are only a few other assertions about the cosmology of Hippasus\nand most of these seem to be the result of Peripatetic attempts to\nclassify him, such as the assertions that he makes all things from\nfire by condensation and rarefaction and dissolves all things into\nfire, which is the one underlying nature and that he and Heraclitus\nregarded the universe as one, (always) moving and limited in extent\n(DK I 109.8\u201310). More intriguing is the claim that he thought\nthere was \u201ca fixed time for the change of the cosmos\u201d\n(Diogenes Laertius VIII 84), which might be a reference to a doctrine\nof eternal recurrence, according to which events exactly repeat\nthemselves at fixed periods of time. This doctrine is attested\nelsewhere for Pythagoras (Dicaearchus in Porphyry, VP 19).\nOur information about Hippasus is sketchy, because he evidently did\nnot write a book. Demetrius of Magnesia (1st century BCE) reports that\nHippasus left nothing behind in writing (Diogenes Laertius VIII 84)\nand this is in accord with the tradition that Philolaus was the first\nPythagorean to write a book.\n\nHippasus originates the early Pythagorean tradition of scientific and\nmathematical analysis of music, which reaches its culmination in\nArchytas a century later. The correspondence between the central\nmusical concords of the octave, fifth, and fourth and the whole number\nratios 2 : 1, 3 : 2 and 4 : 3 is reflected in the acusmata\n(Iamblichus, VP 82) and was thus probably already known by\nPythagoras. This correspondence was central to Philolaus\u2019\nconception of the cosmos (Fr. 6a). Although the later tradition tried\nto assign the discovery to Pythagoras himself (Iamblichus, VP\n115), the method described in the story would not in fact have worked\n(Burkert 1972a, 375\u2013376). Hippasus is the first person to whom\nis assigned an experiment demonstrating these correspondences that is\nscientifically possible. Aristoxenus (Fr. 90 Wehrli = DK I 109. 31\nff.) reports that Hippasus prepared four bronze disks of equal\ndiameters, whose thicknesses were in the given ratios, and it is true\nthat, if free hanging disks of equal diameter are struck, the sound\nproduced by, e.g., a disk half as thick as another will be an octave\napart from the sound produced by the other disk (Burkert 1972a, 377).\nHippasus, thus, may be the first person to devise an experiment to\nshow that a physical law can be expressed mathematically (Zhmud 2012a,\n310).\n\nAnother text associates Hippasus with Lasus of Hermione in an attempt\nto demonstrate the correspondence by filling vessels with liquid in\nthe appropriate ratios. It is less clear whether this experiment would\nhave worked as described (Barker 1989, 31\u201332). Lasus was\nprominent in Athens in the second half of the sixth century at the\ntime of the Pisistratid tyranny and was thus probably a generation\nolder than Hippasus. There is no indication that Lasus was a\nPythagorean and this testimony suggests that the discovery of and\ninterest in the mathematical basis of the concordant musical intervals\nwas not limited to the Pythagorean tradition. Lasus and Hippasus are\nsometimes said to have been the first to put forth the influential but\nmistaken thesis that the pitch of a sound depended on the speed with\nwhich it travels, but it is far more likely that Archytas originated\nthis view. In the later tradition Hippasus is reported to have ranked\nthe musical intervals in terms of degrees of concordance, making the\noctave the most concordant, followed by the fifth, octave + fifth,\nfourth and double octave (Boethius, Mus. II 19).\n\nFinally, Iamblichus associates Hippasus with the history of the\ndevelopment of the mathematics of means (DK I 110. 30\u201337), which\nare important in music theory, but Iamblichus\u2019 reports are\nconfused. It is likely that Hippasus worked only with the three\nearliest means (the arithmetic, geometric and subcontrary/harmonic)\nand that the changing of the name of the subcontrary mean to the\nharmonic mean should be ascribed to Archytas rather than Hippasus\n(Huffman 2005, 179\u2013173).\n\nThe most romantic aspect of the tradition concerning Hippasus is the\nreport that he drowned at sea in punishment for the impiety of making\npublic and giving a diagram of the dodecahedron, a figure with twelve\nsurfaces each in the shape of a regular pentagon (Iamblichus,\nVP 88). This is best understood as reflecting some sort of\nmathematical analysis of the dodecahedron by Hippasus, but it is\nimplausible in terms of the history of Greek mathematics to suppose\nthat he carried out a strict construction of the dodecahedron, which\nalong with the other four regular solids is most likely to have first\nreceived rigorous treatment by Theaetetus in the fourth century BCE\n(Mueller 1997, 277; Waterhouse 1972; Sachs1917, 82). Nor is it clear\nwhy public presentation of technical mathematical analysis should\ncause a scandal, since few people would understand it. The most likely\nexplanation is that the dodecahedron was a cult object for the\nPythagoreans (dodecahedra in stone and bronze have been found dating\nback to prehistoric times) and that it was because of these religious\nconnections that Hippasus\u2019 public work on the mathematical\naspects of the solid was seen as impious (Burkert 1972a, 460).\n\nAnother late story, which appears first in Plutarch, reports a scandal\nwhich arose when knowledge of irrational magnitudes was revealed,\nwithout specifying any punishment for the one who revealed it\n(Numa 22). In Pappus\u2019 later version of the story, the\nperson who first spread knowledge of the existence of the irrational\nwas punished by drowning (Junge and Thomson 1930, 63\u201364).\nIamblichus knows two different versions of the story, one according to\nwhich the malefactor was banished and a tomb was erected for him,\nsignifying his expulsion from the community (VP 246), but\nanother according to which he was punished by drowning as was the\nperson (not specifically said to be Hippasus here) who revealed the\ndodecahedron (VP 247). Modern scholars have tried to combine\nthe two stories and suppose that Hippasus discovered the irrational\nthrough his work on the dodecahedron (von Fritz 1945). This is pure\nspeculation, however, since neither does any ancient source connect\nHippasus to the discovery of the irrational nor does any source relate\nthe discovery of the irrational to the dodecahedron (Burkert 1972a,\n459). Some scholars nonetheless credit Hippasus with the discovery of\nirrationality (Zhmud 2012a, 274\u2013278).\n\nSome have argued that Hippasus was an important figure for the early\nAcademy to whom Academic doctrines were ascribed in order give them\nhis authority and even that he might be the Prometheus mentioned by\nPlato as handing down the method from the gods in the\nPhilebus (Horky 2013). However, there is no explicit mention\nof Hippasus by any member of the Academy and he is a minor figure in\nfourth-century accounts of early Greek philosophy (e.g., Aristotle) so\nit is hard to see what authority he could give to Academic views. \n\nThe other major Pythagoreans of the fifth century were Philolaus and\nEurytus, who are discussed above.\n\nThe name, but not too much more, is known of a number of other fifth\ncentury figures, who with varying degrees of probability may be\nconsidered Pythagoreans. To the beginning of the fifth century belongs\nAmeinias the teacher of Parmenides (Diogenes Laertius VIII 21). The\nathlete and trainer, Iccus of Tarentum, is listed in Iamblichus\u2019\ncatalogue, but none of the other sources, including Plato, call him a\nPythagorean. In the later tradition, he was famous for the simplicity\nof his life and \u201cthe dinner of Iccus\u201d was proverbial for\nplain fare. Plato praises his self control and reports that he touched\nneither women nor boys while training. (Laws 839e; see\nProtagoras 316d and DK I 216. 11 ff.).\n\nSome scholars have treated the Sicilian comic poet Epicharmus as a\nPythagorean and argued that the growing argument which appears in a\nfragment of controversial authenticity ascribed to him in Diogenes\nLaertius (3.11) is thus Pythagorean in origin (Horky 2013,\n131\u2013140). However, no fifth- or fourth-century source identifies\nEpicharmus as a Pythagorean and he does not appear in the catalogue of\nIamblichus. The earliest explicit mention of him as a Pythagorean is\nin Plutarch (Numa 9) in the first century CE. There is no\ncompelling evidence that the reference to Epicharmus as a Pythagorean\nin Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life 266 derives from\nthe fourth-century historian Timaeus as Horky proposes (2013, 116).\nBurkert suggests that the information on Didorus in 266 might derive\nfrom Timaeus (1972, 203\u2013204) but Iamblichus regularly combines\nmaterial from a number of sources so that neither Burkert nor most\nscholars regard the passage as a whole as deriving from Timaeus\n(Schorn 2014 only mentions VP 254\u2013264 as having material from\nTimaeus). Epicharmus has also been thought to be a Pythagorean because\nthe growing argument which he uses for comic effect uses pebbles to\nrepresent numbers and refers to odd and even numbers. However, neither\nof the features is peculiarly Pythagorean; the concept of odd and even\nnumbers belongs to Greek mathematics in general and not just to the\nPythagoreans and the use of counters (pebbles) on an abacus is the\nstandard way in which Greeks manipulated numbers (Netz 2014, 178; cf.\nBurkert\u2019s doubts that there is anything Pythagorean in the\nEpicharmus fragment 1972a, 438). Most scholars regard\nEpicharmus\u2019 Pythagoreanism as a creation of the later tradition\n(Zhmud 2012a, 118; Riedweg 2005, 115; Kahn 2001, 87). \n\nThere is no reason to regard the physician Acron of Acragas as a\nPythagorean, as Zhmud does (1997, 73; he appears to have changed his\nmind in 2012a, 116). Acron is a contemporary of Empedocles and is\nconnected to him in the doxographical tradition (DK I 283. 1\u20139;\nDiogenes Laertius VIII 65). No ancient source calls him a Pythagorean.\nHis name appears in a very lacunose papyrus along with the name of\nAristoxenus (Aristoxenus, Fr. 22 Wehrli), but it is pure speculation\nthat Aristoxenus labeled him a Pythagorean; Euryphon the Cnidian\ndoctor of the fifth century, who was not a Pythagorean, also appears\nin the papyrus. Acron\u2019s father\u2019s name was Xenon, and a\nXenon appears in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue, but he is listed as from\nLocri and not Acragas, so again this is not good evidence that Acron\nwas a Pythagorean.\n\nThe Pythagorean Paron (DK I 217. 10\u201315) is probably a fiction\nresulting from a misreading of Aristotle (Burkert 1972a, 170).\nAristotle reports the expression of a certain Xuthus, that \u201cthe\nuniverse would swell like the ocean,\u201d if there were not void\ninto which parts of the universe could withdraw, when compressed\n(Physics 216b25). Simplicius says, on unknown grounds, that\nthis Xuthus was a Pythagorean, and scholars have speculated that he\nwas responding to Parmenides (DK I. 376. 20\u201326; Kirk and Raven\n1957, 301\u2013302; Barnes 1982, 616).\n\nAristoxenus reports that two Tarentines, Lysis and Archippus, were the\nsole survivors when the house of Milo in Croton was burned, during a\nmeeting of the Pythagoreans, by their enemies (Iamblichus, VP\n250). A later romantic version in Plutarch (On the Sign of\nSocrates 583a) has it that Lysis and Philolaus were the two\nsurvivors, but it appears that the famous name of Philolaus has been\nsubstituted for Archippus, about whom nothing else is known.\nAristoxenus goes on to say that Lysis left southern Italy and went\nfirst to Achaea in the Peloponnese before finally settling in Thebes,\nwhere the famous Theban general, Epaminondas, became his pupil and\ncalled him father. In order to be the teacher of Epaminondas in the\nearly fourth century, Lysis must have been born no earlier than about\n470. Thus the conflagration that he escaped as a young man must have\nbeen part of the attacks on the Pythagoreans around 450, rather than\nthose that occurred around 500, when Pythagoras himself was still\nalive. The later sources often conflate these two attacks on the\nPythagoreans (Minar 1942, 53). Nothing is known of the philosophy of\nLysis, but it seems probable that he should be regarded as one of the\nacusmatici, since his training of Epaminondas appears to have\nemphasized a way of life rather than mathematical or scientific\nstudies (Diodorus Siculus X 11.2) and Epaminondas\u2019 use of the\nname father for Lysis suggests a cult association (Burkert 1972a,\n179). In the later tradition, Lysis became quite famous as the author\nof a spurious letter (Thesleff 1965, 111; cf. Iamblichus, VP\n75\u201378) rebuking a certain Hipparchus for revealing Pythagorean\nteachings to the uninitiated (see on the Pythagorean pseudepigrapha\nbelow, sect. 4.2).\n\nZopyrus of Tarentum is mentioned twice, in a treatise on siege-engines\nby Biton (3rd or 2nd century BCE), as the inventor of an advanced form\nof the type of artillery known as the belly-bow (Marsden 1971,\n74\u201377). Zopyrus\u2019 bow used a winch to pull back the string\nand hence could shoot a six-foot wooden missile 4.5 inches thick\n(Marsden 1969, 14). It is not implausible to suppose that this is the\nsame Zopyrus as is listed in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue of\nPythagoreans under Tarentum (Diels 1965, 23), although Biton does not\ncall him a Pythagorean. The traditional dating for Zopyrus puts him in\nthe first half of the fourth century (Marsden 1971, 98, n. 52), but\nKingsley has convincingly argued that he was in fact active in the\nlast quarter of the fifth century, when he designed artillery for\nCumae and Miletus (1995, 150 ff.). In a famous passage, Diodorus\nreports that in 399 BCE Dionysius I, the tyrant of Syracuse, gathered\ntogether skilled craftsmen from Italy, Greece and Carthage in order to\nconstruct artillery for his war with the Carthaginians (XIV 41.3). It\nseems not unlikely that Zopyrus was one of those who came from Italy.\nThere is no reason to suppose, however, as Kingsley (1995, 146) and\nothers do, that Zopyrus\u2019 interest in mechanics was connected to\nhis Pythagoreanism or that there was a specifically Pythagorean school\nof mechanics in Tarentum (Huffman 2005, 14\u201317).\n\nIt is controversial whether this Zopyrus of Tarentum is the same as\nZopyrus of Heraclea, who is not called a Pythagorean in the sources,\nbut who is reported in late sources to have written three Orphic\npoems, The Net, The Robe and The Krater,\nwhich probably dealt with the structure of human beings and the earth\n(West 1983, 10 ff.). This Zopyrus could be from the Heraclea closely\nconnected to Tarentum, but he might also be from the Heraclea on the\nBlack Sea. A late source connects Zopyrus of Heraclea with Pisistratus\nin the 6th century (West 1983, 249), which would mean that he could\nnot be the same as Zopyrus of Tarentum in the late 5th century. On the\nother hand, Orphic writings are assigned to a number of other\nPythagoreans, and it is not impossible that the same person had\ninterests both in Orphic mysticism and mechanics. Kingsley supposes\nthat the myth at the end of Plato\u2019s Phaedo is based in\nminute detail on Zopyrus\u2019 Krater or an intermediary\nreworking of it (1995, 79\u2013171), and tries to connect specific\nfeatures of the myth to Zopyrus\u2019 interest in mechanics (1995,\n147\u2013148), but the parallel which he detects between the\noscillation of the rivers in the mythic account of the underworld and\nthe balance of opposing forces used in a bow is too general to be\ncompelling. The connection between Zopyrus and the Phaedo is\nhighly conjectural and must remain so, as long as there are no\nfragments of the Krater, with which to compare the\nPhaedo.\n\nA harmonic theorist named Simus is accused of having plagiarized one\nof seven pieces of wisdom inscribed on a bronze votive offering, which\nwas dedicated in the temple of Hera on Pythagoras\u2019 native island\nof Samos, by Pythagoras\u2019 supposed son Arimnestus (Duris of Samos\nin Porphyry, VP 3). There is a Simus listed under Posidonia\n(Paestum in S. Italy) in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue of Pythagoreans,\nso that DK treated him as a Pythagorean (I 444\u2013445) who, like\nHippasus, stole some of the master\u2019s teaching for his own glory.\nThere is, however, no obvious connection between the two individuals\nnamed Simus except the name. Most scholars have thus treated Simus as\nif he were a harmonic theorist in competition with and independent of\nthe Pythagorean tradition (Burkert 1972a, 449\u2013450; Zhmud 2012a,\n118; West 1992, 79 and 240; Wilamowitz 1962, II 93\u201394).\n\nWhat exactly he stole is very unclear. He is said to have removed\nseven pieces of wisdom from the monument and put forth one of them as\nhis own. This is perhaps best understood as meaning that he took an\ninscribed piece of metal from the dedicated object, perhaps a cauldron\n(see Wilamowitz 1962, II 94). The inscription will have included all\nseven pieces of wisdom, but Simus chose to publish only one of them as\nhis own, the other six being thus lost. The piece of wisdom he put\nforth as his own is called a kan\u00f4n\n(\u201crule\u201d). West takes this as a reference to the monochord,\nwhich was called the kan\u00f4n, used to determine and\nillustrate the numerical ratios, which were related to the concordant\nintervals (1992, 240). Since, however, the kan\u00f4n seems\nto have been something inscribed on the dedication, along with six\nother pieces of wisdom, it is perhaps better to assume that the\nkan\u00f4n was a description of a set of ratios determining\na scale (Burkert 1972a, 455; Wilamowitz 1962, 94). There must have\nbeen a scale in circulation associated with the name of Simus. The\nstory that Duris reports is then an attempt by the Pythagoreans to\nclaim this scale as, in fact, the work of Pythagoras or his son, which\nSimus plagiarized. Duris wrote in the first part of the third century\nBCE, so Simus has to be earlier than that. If the son of Pythagoras\nreally made the dedication in the temple, this would have occurred in\nthe fifth century, but it is unclear how much later than that\nSimus\u2019 kan\u00f4n became known. West dates him to the\nfifth century, whereas DK places him in the fourth. Zhmud suspects\nthat he is an invention of the pseudo\u2013Pythagorean tradition\n(2012a, 118).\n\nIamblichus describes an \u2018arithmetical method\u2019 known as the\nbloom of Thymaridas (In Nic. 62), and elsewhere discusses two\npoints of terminology in Thymaridas, including his definition of the\nmonad as \u201climiting quantity\u201d (In Nic. 11 and 27).\nSome scholars have dated Thymaridas to the time of Plato or before,\nbut others argue that the terminology assigned to him cannot be\nearlier than Plato and shows connections to Diophantus in the third\ncentury CE (see Burkert 1972a, 442, n. 92 for a summary of the\nscholarship). There is also a Thymaridas in the biographical\ntradition, who may or may not be the same individual. In a highly\nsuspect passage in Iamblichus, Thymarides is listed as a pupil of\nPythagoras himself (VP 104) and a Thymaridas of Paros appears\nin Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue and is mentioned in one anecdote\n(VP 239). There is also a worrisome connection to the\npseudo-Pythagorean literature. A Thymaridas of Tarentum is presented\nin an anecdote (Iamblichus, VP 145) as arguing that people\nshould wish for what the gods give them rather than praying that the\ngods give them what they want, a sentiment that is also found in a\ngroup of three treatises forged in Pythagoras\u2019 name (Diogenes\nLaertius VIII 9). The anecdote is drawn from Androcydes\u2019 work on\nthe Pythagorean symbola or taboos. If this work could be\ndated to the fourth century, it would confirm an early date for\nThymaridas, but all that is certain is that Androcydes\u2019 work was\nknown in the first century BCE and thus that the anecdote originated\nbefore that date (Burkert 1972a, 167). It seems rash, given this\nconfused evidence, to follow Zhmud and regard Thymaridas as a younger\ncontemporary or pupil of Archytas (2012a, 131).\n",
