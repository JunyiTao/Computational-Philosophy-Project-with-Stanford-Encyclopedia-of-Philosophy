    "main_text": "Principal Contributions || Philosophy of Nature\n3.3 Philosophy of Nature\n\nMaritain\u2019s work in the philosophy of nature appears throughout\nhis work\u2014in his \u00c9l\u00e9ments de philosophie\n(Vol. 1, 1920, Introduction to Philosophy) and in an essay in\nScience et sagesse (1935, Science and Wisdom), but\nparticularly in Les degr\u00e9s du savoir (1932, The\nDegrees of Knowledge) and La philosophie de la nature\n(1935, The Philosophy of Nature). Again, Maritain\u2019s\naccount is based on Aristotle, Aquinas, and John Poinsot, though he\nclearly extends his predecessors\u2019 views. \n\nAs noted earlier, Maritain\u2019s early education and university\nstudies were in the natural sciences. His disillusionment with the\npositivistic approach to the sciences taken by his teachers in Paris,\nand his interest (following his conversion) in bringing Thomistic\nphilosophy to bear on the contemporary world led him to review the\nrelation between philosophy and the sciences and, particularly, to\ndevelop a philosophy of nature. \n\nFor Maritain, the philosophy of nature is a branch of speculative\nphilosophy. It seeks to provide an ontological analysis of corporeal,\nsensible \u2018moving being\u2019 (ens mobile);\nspecifically, it involves a search for the first principles of\nphysical things\u2014i.e., principles that transcend sense. It is\nconcerned with, then, \n\n\na knowledge whose object, present in all things of corporeal nature,\nis mobile being as such and the ontological principles which account\nfor its mutability. (Degrees of Knowledge, 1932 [1959: 197])\n\n\n\nAmong the\u2014and at the summit of\u2014natural objects is\nhumanity, and thus psychology is the highest category of the\nphilosophy of nature.\n\nThe philosophy of nature lies, therefore, between the sciences and\nmetaphysics; it is to be distinguished from metaphysics, which deals\nwith all being qua being, but also from the (empiriological) sciences,\nwhich deal with sensible being qua observable or measurable. Because\nit seeks principles that underlie all physical objects, it follows\nfrom reflections on and goes beyond science; because it still refers\nto such objects and acknowledges that its conclusions need to be\nconsistent with verification by the senses, however, it is not\nmetaphysics.\n\nAccording to Maritain, the investigations of natural science fall\nshort of a philosophy of nature because the objective of a philosophy\nof nature is not merely to reflect on the methods and conclusions of\nthe physical sciences, but to provide the underlying principles.\nMoreover, the philosophy of nature understands that reality is not\nreducible to the physical (physical reality). It focuses on the\nessences of things and the (natural) classes to which those things\nbelong. \n\nMaritain\u2019s account supposes that there is a metaphysical and\nepistemological hierarchy: of sensible, observable things as known\nthrough the senses, to \u201cthe intelligible necessities immersed in\nthe reality of this world of existence\u201d which are known through\nthe intellect disengaged from the senses (Degrees of\nKnowledge, 1932 [1959: 145]), to the \u201cuniverse of quantity\nas such\u201d (mathematics), to metaphysics and, ultimately, to\nmystical experience (see 1932 [1959: 145\u20136]). The levels in this\nhierarchy are determined, then, by how and the extent to which what is\nknown is abstracted from matter. The philosophy of nature, then, is a\ndeductive science that lies at the first level of abstraction. It is\nclose to metaphysics in that it addresses general issues concerning\nthe universe, such as its relation to principles of necessity and\ncontingency, and to a first cause. But it also needs to be completed\nby a knowledge of the natural sciences, and so is at the same level of\nabstraction.\n\nWhat are the principles that such an approach seeks? The philosophy of\nnature is specifically concerned with the nature of movement, of\ncorporeal substance (i.e., matter and form), of life, and of the\nconstitutive principles of organisms. Maritain writes, \n\n\nit belongs to the philosophy of nature to instruct us about the nature\nof the continuum and of number, of quantity, of space, of motion, of\ntime, of corporeal substance, of transitive action, of vegetative and\nsensitive life, of the soul and its operative powers, etc. (1932\n[1959: 186]) \n\n\nand so is at the same level of abstraction as the natural\nsciences.\n\nMaritain\u2019s position here contrasts sharply with that of his\ncolleague, Etienne Gilson, who was more favourable to Bergson and who\nwrote little on the philosophy of nature throughout his life, arguably\nbecause he believed that the underlying Aristotelianism of the\nThomistic position had been rendered irrelevant by modern science\n(Nelson 2007). Even sympathetic critics, such as Gerald McCool, argue\nthat Maritain\u2019s account of the three different degrees of\nabstraction that underlie this view is a distortion of Aquinas\u2019s\nown view (McCool 1989: 254). More ardent critics have objected to\nMaritain\u2019s account of what he calls \u2018positivism\u2019,\nand some, such as George Boas, argued at the time that Maritain\ndepends on a theory of the existence of natural classes that have\nessences\u2014a philosophical theory which may not, in fact, be\npresupposed by most scientists (Boas 1952). (Maritain, of course,\nwould reply that this is precisely his point; such essences are not\nthe object of empiriological sciences.)\n",
