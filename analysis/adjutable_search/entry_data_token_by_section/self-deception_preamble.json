    "main_text": "\n\nVirtually every aspect of self-deception, including its definition and\nparadigmatic cases, is a matter of controversy among philosophers.\nMinimally, self-deception involves a person who (a) \u00a0as a\nconsequence of some motivation or emotion, seems to acquire and\nmaintain some false belief despite evidence to the contrary and (b)\nwho may display behavior suggesting some awareness of the truth.\nBeyond this, philosophers divide over whether self-deception is\nintentional, whether it involves belief or some other sub- or\nnon-doxastic attitude, whether self-deceivers are morally responsible\nfor their self-deception, whether self-deception is morally\nproblematic (and if it is, in what ways and under what circumstances),\nwhether self-deception is beneficial or harmful, whether and in what\nsense collectives can be self-deceived (and how, if they can be\nself-deceived, this might affect individuals within such collectives),\nand whether our penchant for self-deception might be socially,\npsychologically or biologically adaptive or merely an accidental\nbyproduct of our evolutionary history.\n\nThe discussion of self-deception and its associated puzzles sheds\nlight on the ways motivation affects belief acquisition and retention\nand other belief-like cognitive attitudes; it also prompts us to\nscrutinize the notions of belief, intention, and the limits of such\nfolk psychological concepts to adequately explain phenomena of this\nsort. Self-deception also requires careful consideration of the\ncognitive architecture that might accommodate this apparent\nirrationality regarding our beliefs.\n\nSelf-deception isn\u2019t merely a philosophically interesting puzzle\nbut a problem of existential concern. It raises the distinct\npossibility that we live with distorted views that may make us\nstrangers to ourselves and blind to the nature of our morally\nsignificant engagements.\n",
