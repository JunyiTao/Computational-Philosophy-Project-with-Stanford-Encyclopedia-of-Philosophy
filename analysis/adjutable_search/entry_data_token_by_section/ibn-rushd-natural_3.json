    "main_text": "Nature against Fortune\n4. Nature against Fortune\n\nChapter 3 of Aristotle\u2019s Physics II is a treatise on\nthe subject of the four causes and it corresponds almost entirely to\nMetaphysics V.2. Then chapters 4 and 5 examine the question\nof chance and incidental causation, i.e., spontaneity. The question is\nrelated to whether Nature acts with purpose and Averroes sees its\ngreat significance. Commenting on 196b10\u201317, Averroes enters\ninto a discussion with Avicenna on the status of two irregular kinds\nof causation, fortuna and casus, chance (LC f.\n66D\u201367D TC48). In the Arabic translation of the Physics\nthey were bakht and min tilq\u0101\u2019 al-nafs\n(Aristotle, \u1e6cab\u012b\u02bba [1964: 111: 4\u20135]),\nand in Averroes\u2019 short commentary, bakht and\nittif\u0101q, respectively (SC 26: 19). Averroes formulates\nthe Aristotelian argument in the form of a conditional syllogism the\nconclusion of which is that spontaneous causation happens in things\nthat are possible only in a few cases, in minori parte.\nAvicenna argues that the same action can be necessarily caused in some\nbeings and accidentally in some others and that, in a similar way, the\naction can be possible for some beings in most cases and for some\nothers in the least cases. Averroes gives an example of walking and\nresting. According to Avicenna, walking is accidental from the point\nof view of the moving power, but it is necessary from that of the\ndesire.\n\nIn Avicenna\u2019s metaphysics necessity pervades everything, so that\nwe should agree with Averroes\u2019 view that for him \u201call\n[actions] are necessary by\n nature\u201d,[5]\n (LC 66M). Averroes affirms contingency and points out that Prime\nMatter is prepared to receive two contraries in the same way but that\nefficient causes act differently. Any contingent action does not\ncorrespond with two efficient causes \u201ccontrary in the same way\nand at all the time\u201d. Averroes objects that if any efficient\ncause would equally act or not act, then the whole of Nature would act\nwithout any rule, that is, in vain, ociose, a result that\nneither Aristotle nor Averroes accept. The following quotation\nillustrates Averroes\u2019 thought:\n\n\nWhen we say that in Prime Matter the potentiality (potentia)\nfor being is the same as the potentiality for not being, we mean that\ntwo contraries exist in it at the same opposite times, as for example\nrain can be and not be, but here in the winter, and here in the\nsummer, and that the causes equally producing these two contingent\n[facts] must be alternating at equal times, [but] the action of those\n[causes] takes place generally, and [the causes] are the celestial\nbodies, and consequently they are causes of that which exists just as\nof that which does not exist. (LC 67BC TC48)\n\n\nAverroes solves the conflict in an original way, he ranges Prime\nMatter and passive potencies against efficient causes and active\npotencies. Passive potencies are in principle indifferent to a certain\naction and they are the reason why contingent actions may take place\nor not likewise. Active potencies, on the contrary, follow rules so\nthat their actions are not equally contingent but usually happen. A\nfurther distinction between essential and accidental causality helps\nhim to explain generally and rarely occurring actions (LC 67GK TC49).\nUnder another aspect, the agent, or efficient cause, necessarily\nproduces the effect in the case of eternal beings and generally does\nit in the beings that come-to-be (LC 75D TC74).\n\nThe philosopher of Nature enquires about Nature and about the four\ncauses, and we have known the material, formal and efficient causes,\nbut does Nature act for a purpose? Aristotle starts Phys.\nII.8 saying that he is going to prove that Nature belongs to the final\ncauses (198b10\u201315) and Averroes observes that this tenet is a\nbasic principle in Physics and Metaphysics (LC 75L TC75). If the\nphilosopher of Nature would deny the existence of purposiveness in it,\nthe other causes would be annulled. Matter exists on the account of\nform, we have read. Form exists because an agent impresses it on\nmatter, and the agent acts because it wants to achieve an end. And \u201cif\nthe metaphysician would not admit [the principle of purposiveness] he\nwould be unable to prove that God has solicitousness for those\n[beings] that are here.\u201d (LC 75L)\n\nAristotle mentioned Zeus in Phys. II.8, 198b10\u201332 but\nto deny that he produced rain in order that crops grow; rain happens\nout of necessity. Since Averroes read God instead of Zeus in the\nArabic translation available to him (\u1e6cab\u012b\u02bba\n[1964: 144:\n 3])[6],\n and he also used the word in his comment on the first passage (LC\n76H\u201377B TC76), it is remarkable that he did not see divine\nprovidence assailed by that claim. Averroes saw no difficulty in\nNature acting here with purpose, and he placed God in a rank higher\nthan just making rain fall. For him God acts as final cause and the\norder of Nature reveals the presence of His intelligence.\n\nAristotle argued that there is purposiveness in the natural as well as\nthe artificial realm concluding that \u201cit is obvious that Nature\nis a cause, and one directed towards an end\u201d (Phys.\nII.8, 199b32\u201333). Averroes agreed and opposed those who claim\nthat purposiveness exists only in deliberative actions because arts\nact externally while Nature acts internally. He notes that not all\narts are deliberative and that the physician is capable of using the\nart of medicine to heal himself, he is not external to the action (LC\n81I\u201382A TC86).\n",
