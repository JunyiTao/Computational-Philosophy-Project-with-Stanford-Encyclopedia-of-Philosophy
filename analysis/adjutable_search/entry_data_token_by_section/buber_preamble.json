    "main_text": "\n\n\nMartin Buber (1878\u20131965) was a prolific author, scholar, literary\ntranslator, and political activist whose writings\u2014mostly in\nGerman and Hebrew\u2014ranged from Jewish mysticism to social\nphilosophy, biblical studies, religious phenomenology, philosophical\nanthropology, education, politics, and art. Most famous among his\nphilosophical writings is the short but powerful book I and\nThou (1923) where our relation to others is considered as\ntwofold.  The I-it relation prevails between subjects and\nobjects of thought and action; the I-Thou relation, on the\nother hand, obtains in encounters between subjects that exceed the\nrange of the Cartesian subject-object relation. Though originally\nplanned as a prolegomenon to a phenomenology of religion, I and\nThou proved influential in other areas as well, including the\nphilosophy of education. The work of Martin Buber remains a linchpin\nof qualitative philosophical anthropology and continues to be cited in\nfields such as philosophical psychology, medical anthropology, and\npedagogical theory.  Buber\u2019s writings on Jewish national\nrenaissance, Hasidism, and political philosophy made him a major\ntwentieth-century figure in Jewish thought and the philosophy of\nreligion. Buber\u2019s extensive writing on the political dimensions of biblical historiography and prophetic literature not only made contributions to the history of religion but also to contemporary discussions on political theology with an anarchistic bent. His translation, with Franz Rosenzweig, of the Hebrew Bible into German remains a classic in the German language.\n",
