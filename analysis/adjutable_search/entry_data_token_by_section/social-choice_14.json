    "main_text": "The aggregation of welfare measures or qualitative ratings\n4. The aggregation of welfare measures or qualitative ratings\n\nOne way to respond to the impossibility results of preference\naggregation is to argue that mere rankings of alternatives in an order\nof preference provide insufficient information for making satisfactory\ncollective decisions. The idea is that if we enrich the informational\nbasis of social choice, we can avoid some of the negative results.\nThis can be done in at least two ways. The first, which has received\nthe most attention, is to replace preference orderings with richer\nwelfare measures, which may allow interpersonal comparisons. The bulk\nof this section will be devoted to this proposal. A second, recently\npopular proposal is to replace preference orderings with qualitative\nratings of the alternatives. This will be discussed at the end of the\nsection.\n",
