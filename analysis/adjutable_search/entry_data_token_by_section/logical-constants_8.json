    "main_text": "Pragmatic demarcations\n7. Pragmatic demarcations\n\n\nThe proposals for demarcating logical constants that we have\nexamined so far have all been analytical demarcations. They\nhave sought to identify some favored property (grammatical\nparticlehood, topic neutrality, permutation invariance,\ncharacterizability by inferential rules, etc.) as a necessary and\nsufficient condition for an expression to be a logical constant. A\nfundamentally different strategy for demarcating the constants is to\nstart with a job description for logic and identify the\nconstants as the expressions that are necessary to do that job. For\nexample, we might start with the idea that the job of logic is to serve\nas a \u201cframework for the deductive sytematization of scientific\ntheories\u201d (Warmbrod 1999, 516), or to characterize mathematical\nstructures and represent mathematical reasoning (Shapiro 1991), or to\n\u201c[express] explicitly within a language the features of the\nuse of that language that confer conceptual contents on the states,\nattitudes, performances, and expressions whose significances are\ngoverned by those practices\u201d (Brandom 1994, xviii). Let us call\ndemarcations of this kind pragmatic demarcations.\n\n\nThere are some very general differences between the two kinds of\ndemarcations. Unlike analytical demarcations, pragmatic demarcations\nare guided by what Warmbrod calls a \u201crequirement of minimalism\u201d:\n\u2026logical theory should be as simple, as modest in its\nassumptions, and as flexible as possible given the goal of providing a\nconceptual apparatus adequate for the project of systematization. In\npractice, the minimalist constraint dictates that the set of terms\nrecognized as logical constants should be as small as possible.\n(Warmbrod 1999, 521)\n\n\nOr, in Harman\u2019s pithier formulation: \u201cCount as logic only as much as\nyou have to\u201d (Harman 1972, 79). Warmbrod uses this constraint to argue\nthat the theory of identity is not part of logic, on the grounds that it is\nnot needed to do the job he has identified for logic: \u201c[w]e can\nsystematize the same sets of sentences by recognizing only the\ntruth-functional connectives and first-order quantifiers as constants,\ntreating \u2018=\u2019 as an ordinary predicate, and adopting\n appropriate axioms\nfor identity\u201d (521; cf. Quine 1986, 63, 1980, 28). On similar grounds,\nboth Harman and Warmbrod argue that modal operators should not be\nconsidered part of\n logic.[24]\n Their point is not that identity or\nmodal operators lack some feature that the first-order quantifiers and\ntruth-functional operators possess, but merely that, since we\ncan get by without taking these notions to be part of our\nlogic, we should. Warmbrod and Tharp even explore the possibility of\ntaking truth-functional logic to be the whole of logic and viewing\nquantification theory as a non-logical theory (Warmbrod 1999, 525;\nTharp 1975, 18), though both reject this idea on pragmatic grounds.\n\n\nWhile pragmatic demarcations seek to minimize what counts as logic,\nanalytical demarcations are inclusive. They count as logical\nany expression that has the favored property. It is simply\nirrelevant whether an expression is required for a particular\npurpose: its logicality rests on features that it has independently of\nany use to which we might put it.\n\n\nRelatedly, pragmatic approaches tend to be holistic. Because it is\nwhole logical systems that can be evaluated as sufficient or\ninsufficient for doing the \u201cjob\u201d assigned to logic, properties of\nsystems tend to be emphasized in pragmatic demarcations. For example,\nWagner (1987, 10\u201311) invokes Lindstrom\u2019s theorem\u2014that first-order\nlogic is the only logic that is either complete or compact and\nsatisfies the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem\u2014in arguing that logic\nshould be limited to first-order logic, and Kneale and Kneale (1962,\n724, 741) invoke G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems to similar\neffect. Although nothing about the idea of an analytical demarcation\nexcludes appeal to properties of whole systems, analytical demarcations\ntend to appeal to local properties of particular expressions\nrather than global systemic properties.\n\n\nFinally, on a pragmatic demarcation, what counts as logic may depend\non the current state of scientific and mathematical theory. If the\nadvance of science results in an increase or decrease in the resources\nneeded for deductive systematization of science (or whatever is the\nfavored task of logic), what counts as logic changes accordingly\n(Warmbrod 1999, 533). On an analytical demarcation, by contrast,\nwhether particular resources are logical depends only on whether they\nhave the favored property. If they do not, and if it turns out that\nthey are needed for the deductive systematization of theories, then the\nproper conclusion to draw is that logic alone is not adequate for this\ntask.\n",
