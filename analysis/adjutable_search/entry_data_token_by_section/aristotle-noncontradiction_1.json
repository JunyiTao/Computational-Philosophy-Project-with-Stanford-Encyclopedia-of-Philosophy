    "main_text": "The Peculiar Status of the Principle of Non-Contradiction\n2. The Peculiar Status of the Principle of Non-Contradiction\n\nAristotle says that PNC is one of the common axioms, axioms common to\nall the special sciences. It has no specific subject matter, but\napplies to everything that is. It is a first principle and also the\nfirmest principle of all. Like modus ponens, as Lewis Carroll\nmemorably showed, PNC does not function as a premise in any argument.\nUnlike modus ponens, PNC is not a rule of inference.\nAristotle says that it is a principle which \u201cis necessary for\nanyone to have who knows any of the things that are\u201d\n(Metaph IV 3 1005b15). It is no mere hypothesis.\n\nAristotle explains that, given its peculiar status as the firmest\nfirst principle, PNC is not susceptible to demonstration. A\ndemonstration is a deductive argument, the conclusion of which is\ndeduced from firmer, prior premises. It follows that if PNC could be\ndeduced from another premise, then that premise would have to be a\nfirmer and prior principle, with the result that PNC could not have\nbeen the firmest first principle. Aristotle also says that if PNC\ncould be demonstrated, then everything would be subject to\ndemonstration, which would lead to an infinite regress. Therefore\ndemonstration is ruled out, and it is important to be wary of\nreconstructions of Aristotle\u2019s discussion in terms of ordinary\ndeductive arguments. Anyone asking for a deductive argument for PNC,\nas Aristotle points out, is missing the point, or, rather, is asking\nfor something that is impossible without using PNC. You cannot engage\nin argument unless you rely on PNC. Anyone who claims to reject PNC\n\u201cfor the sake of argument\u201d is similarly misguided.\n\nGiven the impossibility of deducing PNC from anything else, one might\nexpect Aristotle to explain the peculiar status of PNC by comparing it\nwith other logical principles that might be rivals for the title of\nthe firmest first principle, for example his version of the law of\nexcluded middle\u2014for any x and for any F, it is\nnecessary either to assert F of x or to deny\nF of x. Instead, Aristotle defies others to find a\nprior principle (Metaph IV 4 1006a10\u201311). For modern\nphilosophers, it is still an interesting question whether PNC is prior\nto other principles of logic, or, indeed, to the notions of truth,\nreference and identity. PNC assumes the notion of identity: It is\nimpossible for (one and) the same thing to belong and not to\nbelong to (one and) the same thing at (one and) the\nsame time &c. PNC is presupposed by Leibniz\u2019s law,\nwhich states that if x and y are discernible (if one\nhas a property that the other lacks), then x is not identical\nwith y.\n",
