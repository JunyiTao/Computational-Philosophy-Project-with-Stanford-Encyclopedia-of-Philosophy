I\nmight, for instance, believe that BW is a crook and desire that he be\npunished. Some of our beliefs and desires are self-directed. I might,\nfor instance, believe that I am not a crook and desire that I not be\npunished. If I know that I am BW, then I should not have all of those\nbeliefs and desires. But I might be ignorant of this. In some\ncircumstances (e.g., amnesia, or receiving deceptive information about\nyour identity) it is no sign of irrationality to not know who you are.\nAnd if you don\u2019t know you are X, you may ascribe\ndifferent properties to yourself and to X.\n\nLewis\u2019s way of handling this problem was exceedingly simple. His\noriginal version of interpretationism had it that belief-states were\nultimately probability distributions over possible worlds, and\ndesire-states were ultimately utility functions, again defined over\npossible worlds. In \u201cAttitude De Dicto and De\nSe\u201d (1979b), he argued that this isn\u2019t correct.\nBeliefs and desires are, at the end of the day, probability and\nutility functions. (Or at least they are approximations to those\nfunctions.) But they are not defined over possible worlds. Rather,\nthey are defined over possible individuals.\n\nWhat that means for belief and desire is easiest to express using the\nlanguage of possible worlds. The standard view is that propositions\nare (or at least determine) sets of possible worlds, and that the\ncontent of a belief is a proposition. To believe something then is to\nlocate yourself within a class of possible worlds; to believe that you\ninhabit one of the worlds at which the proposition is true.\nLewis\u2019s view is that properties are (or at least determine) sets\nof possible individuals, and that the content of a belief is a\nproperty. To believe something then is to locate yourself within a\nclass of possible individuals; to believe that you are one of the\nindividuals with the property. More simply, beliefs are the\nself-ascriptions of properties.\n\nWithin this framework, it is easy to resolve the puzzles we addressed\nat the top of the section. If I believe that BW is a crook, I\nself-ascribe the property of inhabiting a world in which BW is a\ncrook. (On Lewis\u2019s theory, beliefs that are not explicitly\nself-locating will be beliefs about which world one is in.) If I\nbelieve I am not a crook, I self-ascribe the property of not being a\ncrook. Since there are possible individuals who are (a) not crooks but\n(b) in worlds where BW is a crook, this is a consistent\nself-ascription. Indeed, I may even have strong evidence that I have\nboth of these properties. So there is no threat of inconsistency, or\neven irrationality here.\n\nLewis\u2019s suggestion about how to think of self-locating mental\nstates has recently been very influential in a variety of areas. Adam\nElga (2001, 2004) has extensively investigated the consequences of\nLewis\u2019s approach for decision theory. Andy Egan (2007) has\ndeveloped a novel form of semantic relativism using Lewis\u2019s\napproach as a model. Daniel Nolan (2007) has recently argued that\nLewis\u2019s approach is less plausible for desire than for belief,\nand Robert Stalnaker (2008) argues that the view makes the wrong\njudgments about sameness and difference of belief across agents and\ntimes.\n",
