    "main_text": "A Return to Phenomenology\n7. A Return to Phenomenology\n\nA return to an interest in feminist phenomenology, in the footsteps of\nBeauvoir, started with the work of Bartky and Young in the late 1970s,\nbut became widespread only in the 1990s. At the center of\nphenomenological accounts of embodiment is the lived experience of the\nbody. For such writers embodiment is our mode of\nbeing-in-the-world (Young 2005: 9). The notion of\nexperience is treated with great suspicion in the\npoststructuralist framework within which Butler is primarily\npositioned. The suspicion is a consequence of empiricist uses of the\nterm, in which experience is tied to a \u201cmyth of the given\u201d\nwhereby body and world are offered to us in an unmediated way. The\nexperiences to which phenomenological writers draw attention are not,\nhowever, of such a pure kind. For they are experiences of bodies in\nsituations, in which it is impossible to disentangle so called\n\u201cnatural\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d elements. For as\nMerleau-Ponty points out, \n\n\neverything is both manufactured and natural in man, as it were, in the\nsense that there is not a word, not a form of behaviour which does not\nowe something to purely biological being\u2014and which at the same\ntime does not elude the simplicity of animal life. (1945 [1962: 189])\n\n\n\nHere there is an entanglement of nature/culture, matter and meaning,\nwhich parallels that insisted on by Haraway and Barad discussed above.\nBut the phenomenological accounts foreground lived experience of the\nbody in a way that is often absent from, what are now termed, the new\nmaterialist writings, (although it is foregrounded in the writings of\nsome trans theorists, see Salamon 2010).\n\nInterest in the phenomenology of embodiment is an attempt to further\narticulate Freud\u2019s claim that \u201cthe ego is a bodily\nego\u201d (Freud 1923 [1962]), to capture the way corporeal\ncharacteristics surface in our experiences of ourselves and others.\nFeminist writers such as Bartky, Young, Alcoff, Hein\u00e4maa, and\nWeiss are carrying on the project started by Beauvoir; but a major\ninfluence for many of them is also the work of Merleau-Ponty. They put\nsuch resources to work to make visible the variable experiences of\ngendered, raced, classed, differently abled and differently aged\nbodies, to reflect on the way such experiences, mediate social\npositionality, and constitute our sense of self. \n",
