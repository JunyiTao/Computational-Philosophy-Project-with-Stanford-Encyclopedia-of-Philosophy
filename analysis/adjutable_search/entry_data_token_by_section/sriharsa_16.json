    "main_text": "The Futility of Inquiry || The Paradox of Inquiry\n5.2 Scripture and the Limits of Reason\n\nIn the last assessment, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a is happy to concede\nthat the Upani\u1e63ads\u2014which literally proclaim that\neverything is non-distinct from the Brahman or the self\u2014are the\nmeans of knowing non-duality. However, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a thinks\nthat one cannot call Upanisadic testimony into question by appealing\nto perceptual evidence. The ordinary perceptual awareness of\nplurality, as we have already seen in\n Section 3.2,\n is incapable of defeating the awareness of non-duality that is\ngenerated by Upanisadic testimony. Neither can inference of any kind\ndefeat that awareness of non-duality. For \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a,\nthis just shows that one cannot inquire further into the truth or the\nfalsity of the doctrine of non-duality on the basis of evidence that\nis independent of Upanisadic testimony. As he puts it, \n\n\nthat awareness of non-duality [produced by the Upanisadic sentences]\ncannot be refuted by the wise even by means of a hundred arguments\n(tarka). (KKh 118)\n\n\nHis advice to the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher\ntherefore is to withdraw from the project of inquiry and rather to\nadopt an attitude of faith (\u015braddh\u0101) towards the\ncontent of the Upanisadic sentences.\n\n\nYou, who are fond of reveling in ignorance, ought to have faith in the\ndoctrine of non-duality, presented to you by these arguments which, by\nyour own lights, have the features of good reasoning. Consequently,\nyour faith in the content of the Upani\u1e63ads will induce in you a\ndesire to know the self. Slowly, as your consciousness is freed from\nordinary mental states, you yourself shall become acquainted with the\nultimate truth, to which reflexive self-knowledge bears witness, and\nwhich is sweeter than honey. (KKh 120)\n\n\nThis passage is suggestive: it reveals that for\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a, rational inquiry\u2014unconstrained by\nfaith in scripture\u2014cannot be a guide to the truth. The professed\ngoal of the Ny\u0101ya system was to lay down a system of rational\ninquiry which, irrespective of the domain of inquiry, would allow one\nto progress towards to the truth in that domain. But\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a thinks this is impossible. On the one hand,\nhis refutation-arguments are supposed to illustrate that such systems\nof rational inquiry are self-undermining: their own rules can be used\nto undermine the fundamental ontological and epistemological\ncategories that these systems rely on. On the other hand,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a wants to show that we cannot even engage in\ninquiry in good faith, and that arguments presented in the course of\nsuch inquiry\u2014framed independently of scriptural\ntestimony\u2014cannot have any defeating force against scriptural\ntestimony. The best way of making progress towards the truth is to\nhave faith in scripture, and let reason occupy a secondary place.\n\nThis attitude towards reason is something that\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a shares with some other classical Indian\nthinkers (Murty 1959: pt. II ch. IV; Halbfass 1983: ch. II). In Of\nSentences and Words (V\u0101kyapad\u012bya),\nBhart\u1e5bhari claims that reason, without the guidance of\nscripture, is unreliable: \n\n\nAs in the case of the blind man who, guided solely by the touch of his\nhand, rushes down an uneven path, it is not rare for a person who\nrelies primarily on reason to fall. (Subramania Aiyer 1976: 1.42) \n\n\nBut why is reason unreliable? The only clear argument that\nBhart\u1e5bhari offers is an argument from instability: even\nif one presents a skillfully prepared argument in favor of a view, the\nconclusion of the argument can always be undercut or rebutted; for it\nis possible that someone else who is more skilled at argumentation\nmight explain the matter differently (Ibid., 1.34). \u015aa\u1e43kara\nalludes to Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s argument while commenting on\nAphorisms on Brahman 2.1.11: \n\n\nRegarding matters that can be known from scripture, claims are not to\nbe established by reasoning. This is because reasoning\u2014when\nuninformed by scripture and based only on human\nimagination\u2014lacks stability; for such imagination is\nunconstrained. Moreover, even when experts prepare arguments by\nemploying imagination with care, such arguments may appear unsound to\nothers who have greater expertise. Given that arguments imagined up by\nsomeone may later appear unsound to another, arguments cannot acquire\nany stability due to human disagreement. (Shastri 1980: 366\u2013367)\n\n\n\nOwing to this instability, reason alone cannot decisively establish\nanything; only reason informed by scripture\n(\u015brutyanug\u1e5bh\u012bta-tarka) can (1980: 361).\n\nOn at least one way of reading The Sweets of Refutation,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s project is just to illustrate the\ninstability of reason: for any argument the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher may offer for their\nfavorite ontological and epistemological categories, there is a\nrefutation-argument that defeats it. The deliverances of\nreason\u2014thus never immune to rational defeat\u2014can only\nconstitute inconclusive evidence. The important difference between\nSa\u1e43kara and \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a, however, lies in this. For\nSa\u1e43kara, even on matters that are established by scripture,\nthere is some room for inquiry, and reason informed by scripture can\nindeed help the inquirer understand the nature of ultimate reality. By\ncontrast, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a takes his refutation-arguments to\nshow that rational inquiry\u2014whether or not informed by\nscripture\u2014establishes nothing; faith alone can take us to the\ntruth. Rational inquiry, for \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a, is futile.\n",
