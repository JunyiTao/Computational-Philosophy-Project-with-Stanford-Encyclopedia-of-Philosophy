    "main_text": "Revisionist and Eliminativist Proposals\n3. Revisionist and Eliminativist Proposals\n\nPhilosophers have suggested three ways to avoid future iterations of\nthe nature versus nurture debate. First, revisionist proposals aim to\nrestrict the definition of \u201cinnate\u201d to a subset of the\ni-properties outlined by Mameli and Bateson (see Section 2.4).\u00a0\nPerhaps if scientists converge on a single meaning, problems\nassociated with equivocation will decrease, and psychology generally\nwill undergo conceptual progress. Second, eliminativist proposals\nargue that while conceptual revision sounds like a nice idea it is\nunlikely to succeed. A more practical approach, eliminitivists\nsuggest, is to discard innatness as a serious scientific construct. A\nthird strategy, outlined by Cowie (2009) is to do nothing. Vagueness\naround the innate acquired distinction has caused, on her view, no\ninhibition to scientific progress. In this section we review some\nrecent revisionist proposals, attempts to establish a single, clear\ndefinition. Eliminativism and the \u201cdo nothing\u201d proposals\nare considered in Section 3.5.\n",
