    "main_text": "Aristotle\n5. Aristotle\n\nMedieval theories of intentionality \u2013 not to mention more recent\nphilosophers influenced by these theories, such as Brentano (1874\n[1995]) \u2013 draw their inspiration from Aristotle\u2019s theory\nof perception and thought, in particular his doctrine that in\ncognition the form of the sensible or intelligible object is\n\u201creceived without the matter\u201d (On the Soul II 12,\n424a17\u201324; III 2, 425b23\u201324; III 4, 429a15\u201319; and\nIII 8, 431b26\u201329) and the doctrine that the object, or more\nprecisely its activity as an object of cognition, is \u201cone and\nthe same\u201d as the activity of cognition and is present in the\ncognizing subject (III 2, 425b25\u2013426a27). Both perception and\nthought are intentional states, and Aristotle\u2019s analyses of them\nare central to his psychological theory as a whole. But none of these\npassages gives clear evidence of Aristotle\u2019s awareness of the\nproblem of intentionality, much less provides a definition of\nintentionality or any of its essential features. To begin with, each\ndoctrine applies to more than just intentional states. The impression\nof signet ring in sealing wax is offered not merely as an analogy, but\nas a genuine example of a form\u2019s being received without the\nmatter, a point accepted even by commentators such as John Philoponus\nand Thomas Aquinas; Philoponus also mentions images in mirrors as\nanother example (Philoponus, On Aristotle\u2019s On the\nSoul, 444.17\u201326, 437.19\u201325; Thomas Aquinas On\nAristotle\u2019s On the Soul 2.24, 56\u201359 = \u00a7554). This\ndoctrine cannot therefore provide a sufficient condition for\nintentionality, still less for cognition or awareness. Similarly,\nAristotle defends his claim that the object\u2019s activity is one and\nthe same as the activity of cognition and present in the cognizing\nsubject as simply an instance of a much wider causal generalization:\nin every causal interaction, including inanimate and noncognitive\nones, the activity of the agent is one and the same as the activity of\nthe patient and occurs in the patient (On the Soul III 2,\n426a2\u201311). Further, neither of these doctrines holds for all\nintentional states: each fails to apply to paradigmatic cases of\nintentionality, like dreams or future hopes, where the problem of\nintentionality is most palpable. So neither doctrine provides a\nnecessary condition for intentionality either. They are rather general\ncausal doctrines that apply to a special class of intentional states,\nlike perception and thought, where the intentional state is about what\nbrings it about \u2013 that is, it is about its own cause \u2013\nsomething that is not true of intentional states in general. Even if\nthey prove to be central to his theory of intentionality,\nthey do not directly address the problem as such.\n\nAristotle is, however, keenly aware of the special character of\nintentional states. In fact, he excoriates his predecessors for\nfailing to account for intentional states whose objects are\nnot the causes that bring them about. In the second chapter\nof his essay On Memory and Recollection, he rejects the idea\nthat thought extends, like a ray, to its object, because we\n\u201cthink in the same way even when they do not exist\u201d: in\nsuch cases a ray will not work, since there won\u2019t be anything\nfor it to extend to (452b9\u201311). He goes further in his\npolemic On Ideas (81.25\u201382.1), when he rejects Platonic\ntheories that take our thoughts to be of Platonic forms. Because such\nobjects supposedly always exist, whether or not the individuals that\nfall under them do, this sort of theory evades the previous criticism:\ngiven such intermediaries, there is something thought can\nreach. But, Aristotle objects, they cannot account for the full range\nof thoughts we actually have, since we can think of particular\nindividuals who no longer exist, like Socrates, and mythical creatures\nthat \u201cdo not exist in any way at all,\u201d like the\nhippocentaur. In such cases, there is no Platonic form that can serve\nas the object of thought: by the Platonists\u2019 own lights, there\nis no form of Socrates or of Hippocentaur. So simply positing a\nspecial object of the same type as a Form won\u2019t suffice. \n\nAristotle seems confident that his own theory has the resources to\ndeal with both sets of counterexamples. He believes there are changes\nin our bodies that represent or model the objects in\nquestion (without being instances of the exact same type), and by\nundergoing these changes we are able to have thoughts with the\nrelevant contents, whether or not the corresponding objects exist in\nthe world at large. He describes such changes as phantasmata,\na term often translated as \u2018images.\u2019 But while such\nrepresentations are underlie imagistic experiences, such as\nvisualization and dreams, they also bear content in the absence of\nsuch experience. Aristotle deploys phantasmata throughout his\npsychology, both in cognitive states, like thought and memory, and in\ndesires, passions, and action. The underlying capacity, which he calls\nphantasia, is formally introduced in On the Soul III\n3 in response once again to the problem of intentionality. According\nto Aristotle, his predecessors are unable to explain how error could\never take place. On their view, all cognition is about what brings it\nabout, such that \u201clike is known by like,\u201d and this, he\nbelieves, precludes the possibility of error (427a9\u2013b6). But to\nthe extent Aristotle himself explains perception and thought along\nsimilar lines, he will be vulnerable to the same criticism; and\nconsistent with this, he actually regards both states (at least in\ntheir most basic forms, which we might call \u2019sensation\u2019\nand \u2019understanding\u2019) as incapable of falsehood. But unlike\nhis predecessors, Aristotle does not think that all mental\nstates are to be explained on this simple model. As he immediately\ngoes on to argue, phantasia is a distinct kind of mental\nstate that cannot be reduced to sensation, understanding, belief, or\neven a combination of belief and perception (428a24\u2013b9). It\nconsists in perceptual traces, which are capable of affecting the\ncentral organ in the same way that perceptual stimulations do and so\ncapable of producing similar experiences even in the absence of the\ncorresponding external objects. It is this, he claims, that makes\nfalsehood possible and so explains the actions and reactions of\nanimals (428b10\u2013429a8).\n\nThought, Aristotle insists, always requires a phantasma\n(On the Soul III 7, 431a16\u201317, b2; III 8,\n432a8\u201310; On Memory 1, 449b31). But the content of even\nthe simplest concept goes beyond that contained in any such\nquasi-perceptual representations (On the Soul III 8,\n432a12\u201314). At a minimum, in thought we are able to focus\nselectively on certain features, by ignoring many of the other\nfeatures in such representations, just as we can use a diagram of a\ntriangle for mathematical purposes without being concerned with its\nparticular dimensions, and so effectively abstract them\n(On Memory 1, 449b31\u2013450a17). But we are also capable\nof using one concept to form the opposite concept and of applying one\nconcept to another to result in a compound propositional thought\ncapable of truth or falsehood (On the Soul III 6;\nMetaphysics VI 4, IX 10; On Interpretation 1). The\nabstract content that results from such operations allows us to use\nsymbols to speak and understand one another (On\nInterpretation 1, 16a3\u20139).\n\nAristotle also considers higher-order perception and thought. He\noffers a regress argument at the beginning of On the Soul III\n2 to show that when we perceive that we see or hear, we have a\nhigher-order perceptual awareness of the first-order perceiving\n(425b12\u201325) and, while the precise details are a matter of\ncontroversy, it is arguably the same act of perception being directed\nat itself (Caston 2002b; for a response, see Johansen 2005).\nBut Aristotle elsewhere claims that in general states like knowledge,\nperception, belief, or thought are always directed at something\nelse primarily and themselves only peripherally or \u201con the\nside\u201d (en parerg\u014di); only God\u2019s\nself-reflexive thinking, which he characterizes as a \u201cthinking\nof thinking\u201d (no\u0113sis no\u0113se\u014ds), has\nitself as its primary object (Metaph. XII 9,\n1074b34\u201336). Self-directed intentionality raises a number of\nquestions, in particular whether Aristotle is committed to it being a\npart of every mental act \u2013 as he seems to claim at\nNicomachean Ethics IX 9, 1170a29\u2013b1, which Brentano\n1874 [1995], Book II, chs 2\u20134 takes up and champions \u2013 and\nwhether he thinks it is possible to be in error about the content or\ncharacter of the first-order state, even if not about its existence\n(Caston 2002b).\n",
