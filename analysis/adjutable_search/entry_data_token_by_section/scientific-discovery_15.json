    "main_text": "Cognitive perspectives on discovery || Analogy\n9.2 Analogy\n\nMany philosophers of science highlight the role of analogy in the\ndevelopment of new knowledge, whereby analogy is understood as a\nprocess of bringing ideas that are well understood in one domain to\nbear on a new domain (Thagard 1984; Holyoak and Thagard 1996). An\nimportant source for philosophical thought about analogy is Mary\nHesse\u2019s conception of models and analogies in theory\nconstruction and development. In this approach, analogies are\nsimilarities between different domains. Hesse introduces the\ndistinction between positive, negative, and neutral analogies (Hesse\n1966: 8). If we consider the relation between gas molecules and a\nmodel for gas, namely a collection of billiard balls in random motion,\nwe will find properties that are common to both domains (positive\nanalogy) as well as properties that can only be ascribed to the model\nbut not to the target domain (negative analogy). There is a positive\nanalogy between gas molecules and a collection of billiard balls\nbecause both the balls and the molecules move randomly. There is a\nnegative analogy between the domains because billiard balls are\ncolored, hard, and shiny but gas molecules do not have these\nproperties. The most interesting properties are those properties of\nthe model about which we do not know whether they are positive or\nnegative analogies. This set of properties is the neutral analogy.\nThese properties are the significant properties because they might\nlead to new insights about the less familiar domain. From our\nknowledge about the familiar billiard balls, we may be able to derive\nnew predictions about the behavior of gas molecules, which we could\nthen test.\n\nHesse offers a more detailed analysis of the structure of analogical\nreasoning through the distinction between horizontal and vertical\nanalogies between domains. Horizontal analogies between two domains\nconcern the sameness or similarity between properties of both domains.\nIf we consider sound and light waves, there are similarities between\nthem: sound echoes, light reflects; sound is loud, light is bright,\nboth sound and light are detectable by our senses. There are also\nrelations among the properties within one domain, such as the causal\nrelation between sound and the loud tone we hear and, analogously,\nbetween physical light and the bright light we see. These analogies\nare vertical analogies. For Hesse, vertical analogies hold the key for\nthe construction of new theories.\n\nAnalogies play several roles in science. Not only do they contribute\nto discovery but they also play a role in the development and\nevaluation of scientific theories. Current discussions about analogy\nand discovery have expanded and refined Hesse\u2019s approach in\nvarious ways. Some philosophers have developed criteria for evaluating\nanalogy arguments (Bartha 2010). Other work has identified highly\nsignificant analogies that were particularly fruitful for the\nadvancement of science (Holyoak and Thagard 1996: 186\u2013188;\nThagard 1999: chapter 9). The majority of analysts explore the\nfeatures of the cognitive mechanisms through which aspects of a\nfamiliar domain or source are applied to an unknown target domain in\norder to understand what is unknown. According to the influential\nmulti-constraint theory of analogical reasoning developed by Holyoak\nand Thagard, the transfer processes involved in analogical reasoning\n(scientific and otherwise) are guided or constrained in three main\nways: 1) by the direct similarity between the elements involved; 2) by\nthe structural parallels between source and target domain; as well as\n3) by the purposes of the investigators, i.e., the reasons why the\nanalogy is considered. Discovery, the formulation of a new hypothesis,\nis one such purpose.\n\n\u201cIn vivo\u201d investigations of scientists reasoning in their\nlaboratories have not only shown that analogical reasoning is a key\ncomponent of scientific practice, but also that the distance between\nsource and target depends on the purpose for which analogies are\nsought. Scientists trying to fix experimental problems draw analogies\nbetween targets and sources from highly similar domains. In contrast,\nscientists attempting to formulate new models or concepts draw\nanalogies between less similar domains. Analogies between radically\ndifferent domains, however, are rare (Dunbar 1997, 2001).\n",
