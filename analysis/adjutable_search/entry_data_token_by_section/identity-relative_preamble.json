    "main_text": "\n\nIdentity is often said to be a relation each thing bears to itself and\nto no other thing (e.g., Zalabardo 2000). This characterization is\nclearly circular (\u201cno other thing\u201d) and\nparadoxical too, unless the notion of \u201ceach thing\u201d is\nqualified. More satisfactory (though partial) characterizations are\navailable and the idea that such a relation of absolute identity\nexists is commonplace. Some, however, deny that a relation of absolute\nidentity exists. Identity, they say, is relative: It is possible for\nobjects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be the same \\(F\\) and yet not the\nsame \\(G\\) (where \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are predicates representing kinds of\nthings\u2014apples, ships, passengers\u2014rather than merely\nproperties of things\u2014colors, shapes). In such a case\n\u201csame\u201d cannot mean absolute identity. For example, the\nsame person might be two different passengers, since one person may be\ncounted twice as a passenger. If to say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the\nsame person is to say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are persons and are\n(absolutely) identical, and to say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different\npassengers is to say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are passengers and are\n(absolutely) distinct, we have a contradiction. Others maintain that\nwhile there are such cases of \u201crelative identity\u201d, there\nis also such a thing as absolute identity. According to this view,\nidentity comes in two forms: trivial or absolute and nontrivial or\nrelative (Gupta 1980). These maverick views present a serious\nchallenge to the received, absolutist doctrine of identity. In the\nfirst place, cases such as the passenger/person case are more\ndifficult to dismiss than might be supposed (but see below, \u00a73).\nSecondly, the standard view of identity is troubled by many persistent\npuzzles and problems, some of recent and some of ancient origin. The\nrelative identity alternative sheds considerable light on these\nproblems even if it does not promise a resolution of them all.\n\nA word about notation. In what follows, lower-case italic letters\n\u201c\\(x\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(y\\)\u201d, etc., are used informally\neither as variables (bound or free) or as (place-holders for)\nindividual constants. The context should make clear which usage is in\nplay. Occasionally, for emphasis or in deference to logical tradition,\nother expressions for individual constants are employed. Also, the\nuse/mention distinction is not strictly observed; but again the\ncontext should resolve any ambiguity.\n",
