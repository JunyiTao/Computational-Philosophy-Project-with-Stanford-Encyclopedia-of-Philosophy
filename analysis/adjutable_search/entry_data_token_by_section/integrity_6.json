    "main_text": "Types of Integrity\n7. Types of Integrity\n\nReferences to different types of integrity, such as intellectual and\nartistic integrity, abound in the philosophical literature on\nintegrity and everyday discourse. Because integrity involves managing\nvarious commitments and values, one might conjecture that such types\nof integrity are simply manifestations of a person\u2019s overall\nintegrity, or of their personal integrity. However, there are many\npeople who we are inclined to say have intellectual but not personal\nintegrity\u2014or who have more of the former than the latter. If\nthere is a radical disjunction between the type of integrity which is\ndemanded in one sphere of life and another, integrity overall, or\npersonal integrity, may be undermined, or at least profoundly\nchallenged. There may, for example, be conflict between types of\nintegrity, such as between intellectual and moral integrity. (See Code\n1983, 268\u2013282; Kekes 1983, 512\u2013516.)\n\nIs integrity in one area of life likely to flow over into others? This\nis possible, in that the kind of reflection and self-assessment which\ngoes into maintaining integrity in one sphere of life may help people\nto reflect similarly in other spheres. However, given human\nbeings\u2019 capacity and need for compartmentalization, or\npsychologically separating out different parts of their lives, this\neffect will not necessarily occur. The relationship between different\ntypes of integrity and moral and personal integrity needs to be\ncarefully charted. Is integrity a zero-sum game, so that for example,\nthe more artistic integrity a person has, the less she has in personal\nlife? This does not seem necessarily to be the case. At the same time,\na lack of integrity in one aspect of life does not necessarily mean\nthere will be a lack in other aspects of life. Presumably, a person\ncould lack personal integrity, but still have integrity in a number of\nrestricted areas of life, such as in intellectual and artistic\npursuits.\n\nA related question is how different types of integrity are associated\nwith moral integrity. Stan Godlovitch (1993, 580) says that\nprofessional integrity, for example, is weaker than moral integrity,\nand is more like etiquette. For him (1993, 573), integrity\n\u2018trades between the norms of unity and honesty\u2019. More\nspecifically, Godlovitch (1993, 580) argues that the responsibilities\nof performers, for example, are quasi-moral; they are not truly moral\nbecause they are internal to the profession. However, it seems\nplausible to maintain that professional integrity is better understood\nas an important contribution to the living of a moral life.\nProfessional integrity is specific to the sphere of a profession, but\nnot entirely independent of morality.\n\nOne can also ask how types of integrity are distinguished from each\nother. Halfon (1989, 55) argues that we distinguish between types of\nintegrity in terms of commitments to specific kinds of ends,\nprinciples and ideals. However, not every end creates a distinct type\nof integrity. Trivial ends, like train-spotting, do not introduce a\nnew species of integrity. To count as being a type of integrity, the\nsphere of action and commitment in question should be a complex and\nvaluable human pursuit that has distinct ways in which integrity is\ndemonstrated. Robust examples are intellectual integrity and artistic\nintegrity. On this way of looking at the matter, personal integrity\nand various specific types of integrity tend to be run together.\nIntegrity is seen as the one virtue: essentially the same virtue\nexpected of one\u2019s life partner, a friend, an employee, a priest,\na teacher, or a politician. (See Benjamin, 1990; Calhoun, 1995;\nHalfon, 1989; and Grant, 1997.) Professional integrity then becomes a\nmatter of the extent to which a person displays personal integrity in\nprofessional life. Halfon (1989, 53), for example, argues that types\nof integrity may overlap, \u2018So a person who is an artist by\nprofession may come to possess professional and artistic integrity in\nvirtue of performing one and the same action or fulfilling one and the\nsame commitment\u2019.\n\nThere are, however, good reasons to resist this running together of\nvarious types of integrity. In the first place, our legitimate\nexpectations of people must be sensitive to the roles we have tacitly\nor explicitly agreed that they perform. If we expect people to act\nwith integrity in a certain professional context, then our judgment of\nthem should be based on an understanding of this context: its special\nduties, obligations, rights, competencies, and so on. What it is to\ndisplay integrity in one profession need not, therefore, carry over to\nother professions; and the difference between acting with integrity in\none context may not share a common currency with what it is to act\nwith integrity in another context. It seems that the concept of\nintegrity cannot be demarcated into types without specific\ncharacterization of the kinds of challenges and hazards encountered in\nthe relevant field of action.\n\nConsider the example of intellectual integrity. The term\n\u2018intellectual integrity\u2019 is ambiguous between integrity of\nthe intellect and the integrity of the intellectual. While it should,\nin general, be construed broadly, as integrity of the intellect, and\nthus applicable to anyone who thinks, here we will concentrate on the\nintegrity of the intellectual, or integrity as the academic\u2019s\nvirtue, as Susan Haack puts it (1976, 59). Intellectuals may differ in\nthe extent to which they exemplify intellectual virtues such as\nhonesty, impartiality, and openness to the views of others.\nIntellectual integrity may then be thought of as the over-arching\nvirtue that enables and enhances these individual virtues by\nmaintaining a proper balance between them.\n\nHalfon (1989, 54) argues that Socrates had a commitment to the pursuit\nof truth and knowledge, and he demonstrated his intellectual integrity\nin the face of attacks on it. Socrates may be an outstanding example\nof a person of intellectual integrity; nevertheless, there is more to\nintellectual integrity than having a commitment to truth and\nknowledge. Intellectual integrity is often characterized as a kind of\n\u2018openness\u2019\u2014 an openness to criticism and to the\nideas of others. However, if one is too open, one could absorb too\nmany influences to be able to properly pursue any line of thought. So\nan adequate account of intellectual integrity must incorporate\nconflicting claims: that one must be open to new ideas but not be\noverwhelmed by them. An account of intellectual integrity should\nrecognize other sources of conflict and temptations that impede\nintellectual integrity, such as the temptations offered by the\ncommercialization of research, self-deception about the nature of\none\u2019s work, and the conflict between the free pursuit of ideas\nand responsibility to others.\n\nThere are a range of commonly cited intellectual virtues central to\nour conception of intellectual integrity, such as honesty, courage,\nand fairness. Plausibly, such virtues as sensitivity and\nperceptiveness or insightfulness should also be added. In Virtues\nof the Mind, Linda Zagzebski (1996, 114) gives a very\ncomprehensive list of intellectual virtues, adding such items as\nintellectual humility, perseverance, adaptability and\ncommunicativeness. Possession of these virtues is part of what it\nmeans for a person to have intellectual integrity, although they may\nexist in varying degrees without undermining a person\u2019s overall\nintellectual integrity. There are a range of kinds of actions one\nmight expect from a person of intellectual integrity as well: for\nexample, being against plagiarism, refusing to suppress\ncounter-arguments, and consistently acknowledging help. The fact that\nthere are a number of distinct intellectual virtues, involving\ndistinct, and sometime conflicting, dispositions to action, means that\nwe have a need to balance or manage these virtues. For example, a\nperson who has too much intellectual courage may well become a\ndogmatist, and a person who is excessively impartial will probably\nlack conviction. It seems plausible to say that intellectual integrity\nis that quality that enables a person to balance the various demands\nof intellectual work and to manifest intellectual virtues in a proper\norder.\n\nThis balance cannot be maintained without a certain degree of\nreflection on the relationship between different intellectual\ncommitments. The importance of appropriate reflection to intellectual\nintegrity indicates that, like personal integrity, it is closely\nrelated to self-knowledge. Self-knowledge appears essential to\nintegrity in general, and given that intellectual integrity concerns\nknowledge itself, the relationship between having intellectual\nintegrity and self-knowledge is particularly close. This close\nrelationship might lead one to assume that self-deception is\nantithetical to intellectual integrity because it undermines the kind\nof self-knowledge, such as knowledge of our intellectual strengths and\ncapacities, necessary to such reflection. However, self-deception does\nnot necessarily undermine intellectual integrity. In fact,\nsome self-deception might be necessary to pursue some lines of thought\nwell. Having integrity may be consistent with\u2014may even\nrequire\u2014self-deceptive strategies to maintain one\u2019s\nequilibrium in the face of conflicts and obstacles. As Am\u00e9lie\nOksenberg Rorty (1994, 218) points out, self-deception can be\nnecessary to be energized to do anything. The mild self-deception that\none has a good idea before one really has an idea at all is often\nnecessary to get started on a piece of work.\n\nNonetheless, some forms of self-deception are seriously detrimental to\nintellectual integrity. Gabriele Taylor (1981, 146) believes that\nself-deception constitutes the most fundamental and important case of\nlack of integrity. She discusses an example which shows in an\nexemplary manner the dangers of self-deception\u2014that of Casaubon\nin George Eliot\u2019s Middlemarch (1994). Casaubon is a\ncleric working on the connections between different religions, a\nmammoth scholarly work he has devoted himself to for many years. In\nTaylor\u2019s view, he is self-deceived about his commitment to\nscholarship. Casaubon\u2019s problem may be seen as a conflict\nbetween his belief in his capacity and desire to write something very\nimportant and his realization of the truth that he is incapable of\ndoing so. The kind of failure of integrity here is partly due to\nfailure to take the views of others seriously, and thus differs from\ncases where others might encourage one in self-deception. Casaubon\nacted to prevent his wife Dorothea and others from realising the\npaucity of his researches. His case is more blameworthy because of\nthis failure and it demonstrates the way in which self-deception can\nundermine intellectual integrity.\n\nAnother important type of integrity is artistic integrity. Bernard\nWilliams (1981) discusses a fictionalized version of Gauguin\u2019s\nstory, a discussion that raises questions about the relationship\nbetween artistic integrity and other kinds of integrity. On\nWilliams\u2019s (1981, 22) account, Gauguin \u2018turns away from\ndefinite and pressing human claims on him in order to live a life in\nwhich, as he supposes, he can pursue his art.\u2019 In other words,\nthe fictional Gauguin left his loved ones to paint in Tahiti.\nWilliams\u2019s point is that how Gauguin judges himself and how his\nactions are judged partly depends on the success of his artistic\nproject. In Williams\u2019s view, if Gauguin\u2019s artistic project\nfails, we are apt to judge him morally deficient; if his artistic\nproject succeeds, we are likely to see his actions in a more favorable\nmoral light. Although Williams\u2019s discussion of this case is\nfocused on the concept of moral luck, there are two important issues\nconcerning artistic integrity here. First, there is the issue of\nwhether Gauguin acted with a kind of integrity at all, and second,\nthere is the issue of whether artistic integrity, if this is what\nGauguin\u2019s actions manifest, conflicts with moral and personal\nintegrity.\n\nCalhoun (1995, 244) notes that \u2018\u2026 insofar as we imagine\nthat Gauguin, in pursuing \u2018what he found his life bound up\nwith\u2019, acted merely on a psychologically deep impulse without\ncritically reflecting on the value of doing so, we may suspect him of\nnot acting with integrity\u2019. He may have lacked personal\nintegrity because he did not take an assessment of his values and\ncommitments seriously enough. Calhoun (1995, 244) suggests that\nperhaps Gauguin believes that morality does not demand he give up\npartiality to his own artistic project. If this is his view, then the\nsuccess of his artistic project may contribute to a favorable judgment\nof his moral integrity. Williams\u2019s argument that Gauguin\u2019s\nactions are given some sort of justification by the success of his\nartistic project is not entirely convincing. There is no reason to\nthink that Gauguin\u2019s project could only succeed if he turned\naway from the people that depend upon him, leaving them to a\n\u2018grim\u2019 life. Posterity may think more of him as an artist\nbecause of his work in Tahiti, but it doesn\u2019t follow that we\nshould think that Gauguin showed artistic integrity in taking his art\nto Tahiti, valuing his drive to paint in an exotic location above\nother commitments. Nor is it clear that being successful in Tahiti\ncontributes to our judgment of his artistic integrity. Would our\njudgment of his artistic integrity have suffered had he stayed at home\nproducing his art? Artistic integrity may come into conflict with\npersonal and moral integrity, but it is surprisingly difficult to\ncharacterize the precise circumstances of such a conflict.\nWilliams\u2019s fictionalized portrait of Gauguin does not\nconvincingly demonstrate such a conflict (and nor was it devised by\nWilliams for such a purpose).\n\nThere are certainly connections between artistic integrity and the\nmoral integrity of artists, which in turn is connected to the moral\nfeatures of artworks themselves. Novitz (1990, 16), for example,\nargues that the values we bring to art are social ones, and that\nso-called pure aesthetic values are themselves socially induced. At\nthe very least, the moral values which artworks suggest or promote are\nrelevant to considerations of artistic integrity. On the one hand,\nartistic integrity and moral integrity can overlap, particularly if\nthe standards of artistic integrity are high. On the other hand,\nartistic and moral integrity can come apart in situations of great\npressure. Circumstances also vary, and with them both the difficulty\nof pursuing integrity, and our assessment of its merit. Stewart\nSutherland (1996) argues that the case of Dimitri Shostakovich creates\ndifficulties for an account of integrity developed in terms of\nconsistency. The idea is that Shostakovich demonstrated equal if not\ngreater integrity than other more artistically consistent composers\nwriting in more congenial circumstances by coding his works with\nanti-Stalinist irony. More plausibly, however, one might argue that\nShostakovich showed considerable strength of character in difficult\ncircumstances whilst also admitting to his many artistic compromises,\ncompromises which affected his integrity as an artist. Thus, one might\nrate his moral integrity more highly than his artistic integrity.\nExpectations of artistic integrity have to be tempered by\nunderstanding of the conflicts and pressures, both commercial and\npolitical, involved in pursuing artistic values.\n\nDoes having one type of integrity mean that one is, to that extent,\nmoral? Halfon says that integrity in one sphere of life is admirable,\nthough less admirable than having integrity overall and a specific\ntype of integrity may interfere with moral integrity rather than be\nexpressive of it. Yet overall integrity demands that this conflict be\nmanaged in appropriate ways. Integrity is so broad that it has to\nencompass morality in a profound way. Artistic integrity is greater if\nit involves not just following the demands of the profession, but\ndoing so in such a way that one does not diminish others\u2019 lives.\nDaniel Putnam (1996, 237) expresses the point well when he says:\n\u2018Integrity reaches its highest point when it unifies and\nmaintains a balance of virtues.\u2019 In that sense, a particular\ntype of integrity, such as intellectual integrity, is greater when it\ndoes not interfere with personal and moral integrity.\n\nThere certainly can be conflict between types of integrity,\nparticularly where the demands of a profession interfere with personal\nand moral integrity. Pursuit of one particular project can prevent us\nfrom balancing our commitments, as in Williams\u2019s fictional\nGauguin case. However, while different types of integrity can be\nsequestered from each other, integrity of one type is more likely to\nflourish in a context of greater integrity in various spheres of\nexistence. The kind of virtues and skills which are developed in\nmaintaining, say, intellectual integrity, are likely to be available\nto make use of in dealing with the conflicts and temptations which\nthreaten personal and moral integrity, and conversely.\n",
