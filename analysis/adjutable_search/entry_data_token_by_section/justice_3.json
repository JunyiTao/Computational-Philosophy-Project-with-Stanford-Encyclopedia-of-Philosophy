    "main_text": "Justice: Mapping the Concept || Justice and Impartiality\n1.3 Justice and Impartiality\n\nThe third aspect of justice to which Justinian\u2019s definition\ndraws our attention is the connection between justice and the\nimpartial and consistent application of rules \u2013 that is what the\n\u2018constant and perpetual will\u2019 part of the definition\nconveys. Justice is the opposite of arbitrariness. It requires that\nwhere two cases are relevantly alike, they should be treated in the\nsame way (We discuss below the special case of justice and lotteries).\nFollowing a rule that specifies what is due to a person who has\nfeatures X, Y, Z whenever such a person is\nencountered ensures this. And although the rule need not be\nunchangeable \u2013 perpetual in the literal sense \u2013 it must be\nrelatively stable. This explains why justice is exemplified in the\nrule of law, where laws are understood as general rules impartially\napplied over time. Outside of the law itself, individuals and\ninstitutions that want to behave justly must mimic the law in certain\nways (for instance, gathering reliable information about individual\nclaimants, allowing for appeals against decisions).\n",
