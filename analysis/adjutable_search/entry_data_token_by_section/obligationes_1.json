    "main_text": "Background in Aristotelian logic\n2. Background in Aristotelian logic\n\nThe core structure of an obligational disputation is closely similar\nto what we find from Plato\u2019s dialogues. In a so-called Socratic\nelenchus Socrates is putting forward questions, and most of\nthem can be and are answered by \u2018yes\u2019 or by\n\u2018no\u2019. The sequence of questions in effect builds up an\nargument leading to a situation where the person responding to\nSocrates\u2019 questions is often forced to admit the opposite of\nwhat was put as a starting point in the dialectical encounter. As a\ncore background assumption, the person answering has to grant to\nSocrates some propositions because of other propositions that he has\nalready granted. In a somewhat implicit form, the obligational\nprinciple that whatever follows needs to be granted is thus present\nalready in the Socratic elenchus. (See e.g., Robinson\n1953)\n\nThere are however very central differences between the medieval\nobligational disputations and the Socratic elenchus. Indeed,\nit seems possible to sum up the similarities as two core ideas:\n\nBoth are dialectical encounters constituted by one party putting\nforward propositions and the other evaluating them.\nBoth are taken to proceed in a form that is logical, although in\nthe case of Plato the term \u2018logical\u2019 needs to be taken\nwith caution for anachronism.\n\n\nThe main difference between Socratic elenchus and medieval\nobligational disputations is in what happens at the beginning. While\nSocrates normally challenges his discussion partner on a substantial\nphilosophical thesis whose truth would be important to know, there is\nno real issue under scrutiny in obligational disputations. The thesis\nstudied in a Socratic elenchus is never known to be obviously\nfalse, but this is the standard way to start an obligational\ndisputation.\n\nAs is well known, Aristotle developed dialectical encounters in a\nstrictly theoretical manner in his Topics. One question that\nis still open in the modern scholarship on obligations is to account\nfor the role of Aristotle\u2019s Topics in the development\nof the obligations genre in the middle ages. Medieval commentaries on\nTopics do not regularly take up to discuss obligations\nsystematically (see Green-Pedersen 1984). One interesting exception is\nBoethius of Dacia\u2019s commentary (written in the 1270s;\nBreen-Pedersen & Pinborg 1976), but the rules that he proposes for\nobligational disputations appear quite different from what we find\nfrom the mainstream authors of the genre itself (e.g., Burley,\nSwyneshed, and Eland). In any case, even judging on the basis of\nBoethius\u2019 treatment of the technique in the commentary, the\ntechnique does not seem a direct descendant of the so called\n\u2018topical\u2019 tradition in logic.\n\nThere is another medieval descendant of the structure of the Socratic\nelenchus arising more directly from the Aristotelian approach\nto the technique in his Topics. During the thirteenth\ncentury, a number of treatises \u201cOn the Modes of Opposing and\nResponding\u201d were written. (Cf. De Rijk 1980,\nP\u00e9rez-Ilzarbe 2011). These treatises discuss and develop\ntechniques of winning in a disputation, or in other words ways in\nwhich the opponent can force or trick the respondent into granting the\nopposite of the thesis under dispute, or ways in which the respondent\ncan avoid such contradictions. These treatises form an interesting\nparallel to the obligations technique, but even there the core feature\nof obligations \u2013 discussing an obviously false thesis \u2013 is\nnot to be found.\n\nAristotle discussed various times (e.g., Prior Analytics and\nMetaphysics) what may happen in reasoning that starts with an\nimpossible hypothesis, and these discussions have to be taken into\naccount as a second aspect in which obligational disputations have\nroots in Aristotle\u2019s works. When reasoning from an impossible\nhypothesis one is not to worry about truth but about what follows\nlogically. This is one of the central technical issues in obligational\ndisputations. Discussions concerning an impossible hypothesis have a\nlong history that can be traced all the way from Aristotle to the\nLatin medieval period in which obligational disputations properly so\ncalled were developed. And it can also be pointed out that at the\nearliest stages of the Latin medieval development of obligational\ntechnique, assuming an impossibility (positio impossibilis)\nwas one, or perhaps even the standard kind of obligation to be\nconsidered. (See Martin 1993; 1997; 2007; Kukkonen 2002; 2005.)\n\nJudging from texts known to modern scholars, the obligational\ntechnique seems to have achieved a structured format during the\nthirteenth century, perhaps already in its first half. The oldest\ncurrently known dedicated treatises on the obligational technique seem\nto be a pair of anonymous treatises edited by L. M. de Rijk as\nThe Emmeran Treatise on False Positio and The\nEmmeran Treatise on Impossible Positio. (De Rijk 1974.) De Rijk\ndated the treatises in his edition to the early thirteenth century,\nand there seems to be no reason to doubt this rough date. The rules of\nthe technique are in these treatises almost the same as in Walter\nBurley\u2019s Treatise on Obligations,\nwhich might be taken as the standard bearing treatise, written around\n1302 (Green 1963; Kretzmann and Stump 1988). In terms of historical\ndevelopment, the obligational technique belongs to what is often\ncalled logica moderna, which built on Aristotelian logic but\ntook clear distance from the Aristotelian texts themselves.\n",
