    "main_text": "\nIn the early 1980s, Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) was\nintroduced by Hans Kamp as a theoretical framework for dealing with\nissues in the semantics and pragmatics of anaphora and tense (Kamp\n1981); a very similar theory was developed independently by Irene Heim\n(1982). The distinctive features of DRT, to be discussed below, are\nthat it is a mentalist and representationalist theory of\ninterpretation, and that it is a theory of the interpretation not only\nof individual sentences but of discourse, as well. In these respects\nDRT made a clear break with classical formal semantics, which during\nthe 1970s had emanated from Montague\u2019s pioneering work (Thomason\n1974), but in other respects it continued the tradition, e.g., in its\nuse of model-theoretical tools. In the meantime, DRT has come to serve\nas a framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena, but we will\nconfine our attention to fewer than a handful: anaphora, tense,\npresupposition, and propositional attitudes.
