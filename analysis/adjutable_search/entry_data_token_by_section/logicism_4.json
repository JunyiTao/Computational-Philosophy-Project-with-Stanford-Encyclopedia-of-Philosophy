    "main_text": "Neo-Fregeanism\n2. Neo-Fregeanism\n\nThe neo-Fregean revival had its origin in an insight of Charles\nParsons (see Parsons 1965: 183 and 194). He pointed out that what he\ncalled principle (A) below suffices, given the structure of\nFrege\u2019s argumentation in the Grundlagen, for the\nderivation of the axioms of Peano arithmetic. Parsons uses the binary\nquantifier \u2018Glz\u2019 to abbreviate\n\u201cgleichzahlig\u201d (equinumerous), and uses \\(N_x\\)\nto abbreviate \u201cthe number of\u201d:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{A}\nN_{x}Fx = N_{x}Gx \\equiv Glz_x (Fx,Gx).\n\\]\n\n\n\u2026 we can put [Frege\u2019s procedure] in the form of defining\nPeano\u2019s three primitives \u20180\u2019, \u2018natural\nnumber\u2019 and \u2018successor\u2019, and proving Peano\u2019s\naxioms. \u2026 it is not necessary to use any axioms of set\nexistence except in introducing terms of the form \u2018\\(N_x\nFx\\)\u2019 and in proving (A), so that the argument could be carried\nout by taking (A) as an axiom.\n\n\nThis is nowadays called \u2018Frege\u2019s\n Theorem\u2019.[33]\n Frege\u2019s Theorem has Principle (A) as its hypothesis. Curiously,\nthe stress Frege places, in the Grundlagen, on the importance\nof this principles (that two concepts have the same number just in\ncase they are gleichzahlig) is dissipated in the\nGrundgesetze, where the two halves of the biconditional\nappear widely separated: in \u00a753 Frege proves that if two concepts\ncorrespond 1\u20131, then their numbers are identical, and in\n\u00a769 he proves the converse. But nowhere in the\nGrundgesetze does he re-assemble the biconditional and accord\nit prime philosophical importance. Had he done so, he might\nwell have become the first neo-Fregean in response to Russell\u2019s\nParadox. In order to do so, however, he would have had to overcome his\nreluctance to view (A) as a logical\n axiom.[34]\n\nThe neo-Fregean movement seeks to reveal that a significant amount of\nmathematics is analytic. This is a stronger claim than that it is\na priori and derives no part of its justification from\nempirical science, or even from successful applications within the\nempirical sciences. For that would hold of mathematics (or indeed any\nother branch of knowledge) conceived of as synthetic a\npriori. The neo-Fregean maintains in addition that significant\nparts of mathematics flow logically from principles that are analytic\nof (or definitional of) their central concepts or predicates, such as\n\u2018natural number\u2019 or \u2018real number\u2019. That is,\nthey flow from the very meanings of those central predicates. (We opt\nhere for the linguistic version of the analyticity claim). Note the\nstress here on \u2018significant\n parts\u2019.[35]\n We know from G\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem that\nany consistent and sufficiently strong theory of arithmetic is unable\nto prove or refute (the formalized statement of) its own consistency.\nThe latter statement is true, but unprovable. In light of the\nincompleteness phenomena, one would be hard pressed to make good on\nthe claim that all mathematical truths are true by virtue\nonly of such logical considerations as can be captured in\nsystems of formal\n proof.[36]\n When the first principles of a mathematical theory, such as\narithmetic, form an essentially incomplete axiomatization, the\nlogicist will have to maintain that the justification of any\nnew first principle can be furnished in some strictly logical\nsense.\n\nNote that the foregoing remarks describe the general context for a\nneo-Fregean revival of logicism of any kind. They do not dictate the\nexact form of any such revival. In\n \u00a73\n we discuss the particular form of the revival that involves extending\nsecond-order logic with Hume\u2019s Principle; and in\n \u00a74,\n we discuss constructive logicism.\n\nThese two forms of neo-Fregean revival of logicism share the following\nthree important features with Frege\u2019s own treatment.\n\nFirst, the number 0 (zero) is still defined as the number of any empty\nconcept: in particular, as the number of non-self-identical\nthings (formally: \\(\\# x \\neg x = x\\)).\n\nSecondly, once the existence of any natural number \\(n\\) is secured,\nthat of its successor, \\(s(n)\\), is secured by taking \\(s(n)\\) to be\nthe number of all natural numbers from 0 to \\(n\\),\ninclusive (Frege\u2019s trick).\n\nThirdly, the definition of the concept of natural number exploits the\nnotion of the ancestral of the relation of succession: \\(x\\)\nbears the succession-ancestral relation to \\(y\\) just in case \\(y\\) is\nat most finitely many steps of succession away from \\(x\\). (As already\nmade clear, any apparent circularity in this definition, deriving from\nthe adverbial gloss \u2018finitely\u2019, turns out, upon closer\ninspection of the definitions used, to be just that: merely apparent.)\nThe concept \u201c\\(z\\) is a natural number\u201d is then defined as\n\u201ceither 0 is \\(z\\), or 0 bears the succession-ancestral relation\nto \\(z\\)\u201d. And this is what allows the neo-Fregean logicist to\nderive the principle of mathematical induction for the natural\nnumbers. The reader of this survey article will be spared the formal\ndetails. They can be found in Tennant (2022).\n",
