    "main_text": "What is Mathematical Platonism? || The mathematical significance of platonism\n1.5 The mathematical significance of platonism\n\nWorking realism is the methodological view that mathematics\nshould be practiced as if platonism was true (Bernays 1935,\nShapiro 1997, pp. 21\u201327 and 38\u201344). This requires some\nexplanation. In debates about the foundations of mathematics platonism\nhas often been used to defend certain mathematical methods, such as\nthe following:\n\nClassical first-order (or stronger) languages whose singular terms\nand quantifiers appear to be referring to and ranging over\nmathematical objects. (This contrasts with the languages that\ndominated earlier in the history of mathematics, which relied more\nheavily on constructive and modal vocabulary.)\nClassical rather than intuitionistic logic.\nNon-constructive methods (such as non-constructive existence\nproofs) and non-constructive axioms (such as the Axiom of\nChoice).\nImpredicative definitions (that is, definitions that quantify over\na totality to which the object being defined would belong).\n\u2018Hilbertian optimism\u2019, that is, the belief that every\nmathematical problem is in principle\n solvable.[8]\n\n\nAccording to working realism, these and other classical methods are\nacceptable and available in all mathematical reasoning. But working\nrealism does not take a stand on whether these methods require any\nphilosophical defense, and if so, whether this defense must be based\non platonism. In short, where platonism is an explicitly philosophical\nview, working realism is first and foremost a view within mathematics\nitself about the correct methodology of this discipline. Platonism and\nworking realism are therefore distinct views.\n\nHowever, there may of course be logical relations between the two\nviews. Given the origin of working realism, it is not surprising that\nthe view receives strong support from mathematical platonism. Assume\nthat mathematical platonism is true. Then clearly the language of\nmathematics ought to be as described in (i). Secondly, provided it is\nlegitimate to reason classically about any independently existing part\nof reality, (ii) would also follow. Thirdly, since platonism ensures\nthat mathematics is discovered rather than invented, there would be no\nneed for mathematicians to restrict themselves to constructive methods\nand axioms, which establishes (iii). Fourth, there is a powerful and\ninfluential argument due to G\u00f6del (1944) that impredicative\ndefinitions are legitimate whenever the objects being defined exist\nindependently of our definitions. (For instance, \u2018the tallest\nboy in the class\u2019 appears unproblematic despite being\nimpredicative.) If this is correct, then (iv) would follow. Finally,\nif mathematics is about some independently existing reality, then\nevery mathematical problem has a unique and determinate answer, which\nprovides at least some motivation for Hilbertian optimism. (See,\nhowever, the discussion of plenitudinous platonism in Section\n 4.2.)\n\nThe truth of mathematical platonism would therefore have important\nconsequences within mathematics itself. It would justify the classical\nmethods associated with working realism and encourage the search for\nnew axioms to settle questions (such as the Continuum Hypothesis)\nwhich are left open by our current mathematical theories.\n\nHowever, working realism does not in any obvious way imply platonism.\nAlthough working realism says that we are justified in using the\nplatonistic language of contemporary mathematics, this falls short of\nplatonism in at least two ways. As the above discussion of truth-value\nrealism showed, the platonistic language of mathematics can be\nanalysed in such a way as to avoid reference to and quantification\nover mathematical objects. Moreover, even if a face-value analysis of\nthe language of mathematics could be justified, this would support\nobject realism but not platonism. An additional argument would be\nneeded for the third component of platonism, namely,\nIndependence. The prospects for such an argument are\ndiscussed in Section\n 4.1.\n",
