    "main_text": "Kant as a Phenomenalist || Criticisms of Phenomenalist Readings\n3.3 Criticisms of Phenomenalist Readings\n\nSince the Feder-Garve objection to Kant has been around almost as long\nas the Critique itself, many objections to broadly\nphenomenalist readings of Kant\u2019s idealism have accumulated.\nPerhaps the most comprehensive list of such objections is given by\nAllais (2004). They include:\n\n \u201cKant\u2019s claim that his notion of appearance\nimplies that there is something that appears\u201d. We have already\ndiscussed how the qualified phenomenalist can accommodate this\npoint.\n \u201cEmpirically real objects and the space they\ninhabit are public\u201d. Allais seems to assume that, on a\nphenomenalist analysis of objects in space, objects are\n\u201cprivate\u201d, meaning the objects each subject perceives are\nconstituted by sense data of that subject, which, by definition,\ncannot be perceived by other subjects. But the qualified phenomenalist\nconception of universal experience sketched above is explicitly\n\u201cnon-private\u201d in this sense; it is based on the\nperceptions of all subjects.\n \u201cKant\u2019s distinction between primary and secondary\nqualities\u201d. However, the qualified phenomenalist can claim that\nwhile our perceptions represent objects as having secondary qualities,\nthe best scientific theory justified by the totality of those\nperceptions (universal experience) does not represent them as having\nthose properties, because there is a better theory available: objects\ndo not possess such properties but do possess powers to cause us to\nperceive them as having such properties. There is, in principle, no\nbarrier to a qualified phenomenalist allowing the distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities.\n \u201cKant\u2019s realism about the unobservable entities of\ntheoretical science\u201d. Kant is a scientific realist, in that he\naccepts the existence of unobservable entities posited by our best\nphysical theories (magnetic matter, Newtonian \u201clamellae\u201d).\nAllais thinks this is incompatible with a phenomenalist reading, but\nit is compatible with the conception of universal experience developed\nin the previous section. If universal experience has the content of\nthe scientific theory best justified by our perceptions, then\nuniversal experience can represent unobservable (=unperceivable)\nobjects (cf. Allison (2004: 46)) who also objects that phenomenalism\nis incompatible with Kant\u2019s empirical realism).\n \u201cEmpirically real objects exist through time and\nunperceived, and are in causal relations\u201d. The fact that\nempirically real objects exist through time while unperceived might be\nthought to pose a problem for phenomenalism, although it should be\nremembered that Berkeley (at least on some readings) is a\nphenomenalist and yet accepts that objects exist while unperceived\n(although he denies that they stand in causal relations). So it\nisn\u2019t clear why Allais think this is incompatible with\nphenomenalism. And it clearly is compatible with the conception of\nuniversal experience developed in the previous section: experience\nrepresents objects as existing through time and unperceived, because a\ntheory that represents them as existing only when perceived would be\nfar less unified and lawful.\n \u201cWe do not know what ideas are in themselves\u201d.\nAllais\u2019s idea seems to be that the phenomenalist is committed to\ngrounding empirical objects not in \u201cempirical ideas\u201d\n(temporally ordered mental states available in conscious\nintrospection) but in \u201cnoumenal ideas\u201d (the non-temporal\nstates of the subject in itself). But it is unclear why; the\nphenomenalist conception of experience developed in the previous\nsection explicitly grounds the a posteriori content of\nuniversal experience in \u201cempirical\u201d ideas, the totality of\nsubjects\u2019\n perceptions.[30]\n\n\nAllais appears to have conflated phenomenalist readings of Kant in\ngeneral with the \u201cstrong\u201d phenomenalism (or even identity\nphenomenalism) discussed in\n section 2,\n and one, moreover, that identifies experience with mere\nperception.\n",
