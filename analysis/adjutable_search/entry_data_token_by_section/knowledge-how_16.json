    "main_text": "The Argument from Cognitive Science || The Argument\n7.1 The Argument\n\nThe argument from cognitive science against intellectualism starts by\npointing out that cognitive scientists distinguish between different\nkinds of cognitive systems: It is often held that the declarative\nsystem is responsible for encoding propositional knowledge,\nwhereas knowledge-how is encoded in the procedural system.\nGiven empirical evidence that the declarative and procedural systems\nare separate (about which more below), it would seem to follow that\nknowledge-how is not reducible to propositional knowledge (Wallis\n2008; Devitt 2011; Roth & Cummins 2011):\n\n\nThe Cognitive Science Argument\n\nC1\n The procedural system is distinct from the declarative\nsystem.\nC2 \n Motor knowledge-how is encoded entirely by the procedural\nsystem.\nC3 \n All propositional knowledge is encoded entirely in the\ndeclarative system.\nC4 \n Some knowledge-how does not require propositional knowledge.\n(from C1, C2, C3)\n\n\n\nThe usual evidence marshaled in favor of C1 relies on amnesiac case\nstudies (Milner 1962; see Cohen & Squire 1980 for discussion). A\ntypical example is HM. After bilateral removal of the hippocampus,\nparahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and most of the amygdala to\nrelieve debilitating symptoms of epilepsy, HM was unable to form new\nmemories of facts or events and he could no longer access memories he\nacquired in the few years leading up to his surgery. Nevertheless, it\nwas found that over 10 trials, HM tuned his motor skill to trace the\noutline of a five-pointed star based only on looking at reflection in\na mirror. Since he could not store new memories, HM\u2019s\ndeclarative knowledge of the means of performing the task did not\nchange from one trial to the next. But his performance improved. So,\nthe reasoning goes, the improvement of motor skills is governed by a\ndistinct cognitive system from that which governs the retention of\ndeclarative facts.\n\nMany embrace C2 (e.g., Lewicki, Czyzewska, & Hoffman 1987: 523;\nDevitt 2011; Wallis 2008). But some object that a closer look at the\ndetails of HM\u2019s case (as reported in Milner 1962) supports a\ndifferent diagnosis, on which knowledge-how is realized by a\ncombination of the procedural and the declarative system (Pavese 2013;\nStanley & Krakauer 2013). At the beginning of each trial, prior to\nbeing given verbal instructions on how to perform the motor task, HM\nlacked the ability to intentionally perform it: HM was able to perform\nthe motor task only after being reminded of what the task\nconsisted in. This suggests, against C2, that there was an\nimportant declarative component to HM\u2019s ability to perform the\nmotor task (for the role of declarative knowledge in skillful action,\nsee also Christensen, Sutton, & Bicknell 2019).\n",
