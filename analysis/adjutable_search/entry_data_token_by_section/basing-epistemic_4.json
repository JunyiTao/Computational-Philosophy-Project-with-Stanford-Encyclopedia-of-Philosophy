    "main_text": "Causal-Doxastic Theories of the Basing Relation\n5. The Basing Relation and Epistemology\n\nGiven that a necessary condition of a belief\u2019s being justified\nis that it be based on an appropriate reason, which theory of the\nbasing relation one adopts may have significant implications for\none\u2019s theory of epistemic justification. For example, accepting\na doxastic or a causal-doxastic theory of the basing relation would\nappear to be at odds with the fundamental intuition behind causal\ntheories of justification (e.g., reliabilism), which assert that a\nbelief is justified merely by being caused in an appropriate way. On a\ndoxastic or causal-doxastic theory, a belief may be based on a good\nreason (and thus, we may suppose, be justified) even if the belief\nwere not caused in the appropriate way or even if the belief were,\nsomehow, not caused at all.\n\nAccepting some doxastic theories of the basing relation will commit\none to a strong form of access internalism. Strong access internalism\nis the view that one must be aware of one\u2019s reasons for a belief\nin order for the belief to be justified in light of those reasons.\nPlausible doxastic theories of the basing relation will likely have\nbuilt in this requirement of access to one\u2019s reasons by virtue\nof requiring that, for a belief to be based on a reason, one must\nbelieve or be aware that the reason is a good reason to hold the\nbelief. Plausible doxastic theories will likely stipulate that one\ncannot have an appropriate meta-belief or state of awareness without\nbeing directly aware of the reason in question, in order to avoid\ncounting meta-beliefs such as that of Ezekiel\u2019s, in the example\ndiscussed above, as sufficient to establish basing relations.\n\nFinally, novel arguments for various forms of skepticism about\njustification can be developed that focus on improperly based beliefs,\nthough such arguments remain largely unexplored. One exception is in\nJonathan Schaffer\u2019s discussion of the debasing demon (Schaffer\n2010). Unlike the Cartesian Demon, the debasing demon may leave\none\u2019s beliefs true and reasons adequate, yet \u201ccross the\nwires\u201d so that beliefs are only based on reasons that fail to\njustify them. Such demonic efforts may include mistaken beliefs about\nwhat belief is based on what reason. Schaffer argues that the debasing\ndemon even leaves us without the foundation of Descartes\u2019\ncogito, since one might be misled as to what reason\none\u2019s belief in one\u2019s own existence is based.\n",
