    "main_text": "Pragmatic Arguments and Belief\n9. Atheistic Pragmatic Arguments\n\nWhile not as common as theistic arguments, there have been atheistic\npragmatic arguments offered from time to time. These arguments often\narise within the context of a purported naturalistic explanation of\nthe occurrence of religious belief and practice. Perhaps the earliest\nproponent of an atheistic pragmatic argument was David Hume\n(1711\u20131776). In chapter X of his 1757 The Natural History of\nReligion, Hume wrote:\n\nWhere the deity is presented as infinitely superior to mankind, this\nbelief \u2026 is apt, when joined with superstitious terrors, to sink the\nhuman mind into the lowest submission and abasement \u2026\n\n\nThe idea of Hume\u2019s argument here and elsewhere in his writings\n(see for instance Dialogue XII of his Dialogues Concerning Natural\nReligion, and appendix IV of the second Enquiry) is that theism,\nor at least theism of the popular sort \u2013 that conjoined with\n\u201csuperstitious terrors,\u201d degrades individual morality,\nthereby devaluing human existence. Theistic belief, Hume contended,\ninculcates the \u201cmonkish virtues of mortification, penance,\nhumility, and passive suffering, as the only qualities which are\nacceptable\u2026\u201d But not only does theistic belief harm\nindividual morality, according to Hume, it also harms public morality.\nIn chapter IX, Hume suggested that theism (again he qualifies by\nwriting of the \u201ccorruptions of theism\u201d) leads to\nintolerance and persecution.\n\nAnother atheistic pragmatic argument is that of Sigmund Freud\n(1856\u20131939), who in The Future of an Illusion (1927)\ncontends that religious belief perpetuates psychological immaturity\namong individuals, and cultural immaturity on the social level. To\nmake sense of Freud\u2019s argument requires knowing that he employed\nthe term \u201cillusion\u201d in an idiosyncratic way. An illusion\nin the Freudian sense is a belief that is caused by and in turn\nsatisfies a deep psychological need or longing. Illusions are not held\nrationally. Illusions stick even in the absence of any supporting\nevidence. Indeed, according to Freud, they stick even in the face of\nstrong contra-evidence. An illusion could be true, but often they are\nnot. Delusions are false illusions. Religious belief Freud thought was\nan illusion. While it may have been a beneficial illusion at an\nearlier time, it no longer is. The religious illusion now, Freud\nasserted, inhibits scientific progress, and causes psychological\nneuroses, among its other pernicious effects.\n\nAnother atheistic pragmatic argument is Richard Dawkins\u2019s\ncontention that religious belief is a \u201cvirus of the mind\u201d\n(Dawkins 1993). One is religious, according to Dawkins, because one\nhas been infected by a faith meme. A meme is Dawkins\u2019s\nimaginative construct, which he describes as a bit of information,\nmanifested in behavior, and which can be copied from one person to\nanother. Like genes, memes are self-replicating vehicles, jumping from\nmind to mind. One catches a meme by exposure to another who is\ninfected. Dawkins claims that the faith meme has the following\ntraits:\n\nM1.\nThe faith meme seems to the person as true, or right, or virtuous,\nthough this conviction in fact owes nothing to evidence or reason.\nM2.\nThe faith meme makes a virtue out of believing in spite of there\nbeing no evidence.\nM3.\nThe faith meme encourages intolerant behavior towards those who\npossess rival faiths.\nM4.\nThe faith meme arises not because of evidence but because of\nepidemiology; typically, if one has a faith, it is the same as\none\u2019s parents and as one\u2019s grandparents.\n\n\nDawkins\u2019s meme idea, and his dismissal of faith as a virus of\nthe mind, is both a purported naturalistic explanation of religious\nbelief and a pragmatic dismissal of it as a harmful phenomenon.\n\nA contemporary atheistic pragmatic argument is that the existence of\nGod would make the world far worse in some respects than would be the\ncase if God did not exist, even if it did not make the world worse\noverall (Kahane 2011). As Kahane notes, if God were to exist, then a\nfull understanding of reality by humans, may in-principle be\nunachievable. Additionally, if God were to exist, moral autonomy may\nbe limited, since humans, as creatures, might be subordinate to\nGod\u2019s demands, including demands for worship, obedience, and\nallegiance. Finally, if God were to exist, complete privacy may be\nlost, as an omniscient being could, presumably, know one\u2019s\nthoughts and attitudes.\n\nKahane\u2019s intricate argument is counter to the conventional view\nthat God\u2019s existence is something that all should hope for,\nsince this world would, arguably, be the best or among the best of all\npossible worlds if God were to exist. Even so, Kahane argues that one\ncould rationally prefer that God not exist. The argument involves a\ndistinction between evaluations from an impersonal viewpoint, and from\na personal viewpoint. It is the latter, which proves the most\npromising for the argument as Kahane contends that the existence of\nGod could undermine the meaning generating life-projects of some. If\nhis argument is sound, Kahane has provided a kind of atheistic\npragmatic argument that one could prefer that God not exist, even if\nGod\u2019s existence would render the world better overall than it\notherwise would be.\n\nMuch of Kahane\u2019s argument consists of comparisons between\npossible worlds in which God exists (\u201cGodly worlds\u201d), and\nthose in which God does not exist (\u201cGodless worlds\u201d). The\nmodal reliability of these comparisons is far from obvious, since God\nis standardly seen as a necessarily existing being. For a critical\nexamination of Kahane\u2019s arguments, see Kraay 2013.\n",
