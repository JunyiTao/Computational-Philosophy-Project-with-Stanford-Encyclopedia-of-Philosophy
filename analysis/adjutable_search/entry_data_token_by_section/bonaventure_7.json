    "main_text": "Physical Creation || Seminal reasons\n3.5 Seminal reasons\n\nThe transition in the order of natural history from bodies that are\nsimply such, extended and endowed with the ability to act and be acted\nupon, to the bodies of plants and animals is explained in part through\nthe motions of the celestial bodies and their causal influences on\nmatter. In part, however, matter itself has latent structures that\nsimply await the correct circumstances and conditions to cause the\nemergence of a higher type of body. These latent structures,\noriginally sown into matter at its creation, Bonaventure calls,\nfollowing the terminology of St. Augustine, rationes\nseminales or seminal reasons, a term hearkening back to the\ncosmology of the ancient Stoics. Seminal reasons amount to a lingering\nimpact of the creator on the matter of the physical world since their\npresence in matter originates with creation. In physical science,\nBonaventure believes seminal reasons help to explain the successive\nemergence of the different kinds of bodies suitable for higher and\nhigher types of life. But this process of gradual emergence does not\napply to the creation of human life, since human souls for Bonaventure\nare incorruptible and can only arise through the direct action of the\ncreator.\n\nThough from our post-Darwinian perspective we may be tempted to see in\nthe doctrine of seminal reasons, whether in Augustine or Bonaventure,\na curious, yet awkward anticipation of the doctrine of evolution,\nsimilarities between the doctrine of seminal reasons and certain\nelements in evolutionary theory are more apparent than real. First,\nthough seminal reasons do provide directionality and progression for\nthe succession of physical types in natural history, they are\nthemselves latent forms within matter and not reducible to more\nfundamental mechanical or chemical processes; rather, they underlie\nsuch processes. Second, seminal reasons are never appealed to in order\nto explain the demise of one living species and the emergence of\nanother species to replace the former, a key feature of Darwinian\nexplanations. Third, seminal reasons are not, as we have just seen,\nuniversal in their application to the living things that occur within\nthe order of natural history; human beings, at least in terms of their\nsouls, fall outside the range of influence of seminal reasons.\n",
