Historical Background: The Moral Point of View\n\nThe idea of the moral point of view can be traced back to David\nHume\u2019s account of the \u201cjudicious spectator.\u201d Hume\nsought to explain how moral judgments of approval and disapproval are\npossible given that people normally are focused on achieving their own\ninterests and concerns. He conjectured that in making moral judgments\nindividuals abstract in imagination from their own interests and adopt\nan impartial point of view from which they assess the effects of their\nown and others\u2019 actions on the interests of everyone. Since,\naccording to Hume, we all can adopt this impartial perspective in\nimagination, it accounts for our agreement in moral judgments (see\nHume 1739 [1978, 581]; Rawls, LHMP 84\u201393, LHPP\n184\u2013187).\n\nSubsequently, philosophers posited similar perspectives for moral\nreasoning designed to yield impartial judgments once individuals\nabstract from their own aims and interests and assess situations from\nan impartial point of view. But rather than being mainly explanatory\nof moral judgments like Hume\u2019s \u201cjudicious\nspectator,\u201d the role of these impartial perspectives is to serve\nas a basis from which to assess and justify moral rules and\nprinciples. Kant\u2019s categorical imperative procedure, Adam\nSmith\u2019s \u201cimpartial spectator,\u201d, and Sidgwick\u2019s\n\u201cpoint of view of the universe\u201d are all different versions\nof the moral point of view.\n\nAn important feature of the moral point of view is that it is designed\nto represent what is essential to the activity of moral reasoning. For\nexample, Kant\u2019s categorical imperative is envisioned as a point\nof view any reasonable morally motivated person can adopt in\ndeliberating about what they ought morally to do (Rawls, CP 498ff;\nLHMP). When joined with the common assumption that the totality of\nmoral reasons is final and override non-moral reasons, the moral point\nof view might be regarded as the most fundamental perspective that we\ncan adopt in our reasoning about justice and what we morally ought to\ndo.\n\nRawls\u2019s idea of the original position, as initially conceived,\nis his account of the moral point of view regarding matters of\njustice. The original position is a hypothetical perspective that we\ncan adopt in our moral reasoning about the most basic principles of\nsocial and political justice. What primarily distinguishes\nRawls\u2019s impartial perspective from its antecedents (in Hume,\nSmith, Kant, etc.) is that, rather than representing the judgment of\none person, it is conceived socially, as a general agreement by\n(representatives of all adult) members of an ongoing society. The\npoint of view of justice is then represented as a general\n\u201csocial contract\u201d or agreement by free and equal persons\non the basic terms of cooperation for their society.\n",
