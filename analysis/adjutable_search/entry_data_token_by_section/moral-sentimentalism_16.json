    "main_text": "Epistemic Sentimentalism || Tracking Theories\n5.2 Tracking Theories\n\nNot all epistemic sentimentalists subscribe to the perceptualist\nmodel. One alternative is provided by John Allman and Jim Woodward\n(2008), who argue that moral intuitions (in the sense of immediate\njudgments resulting from what psychologists call System 1) involving\nemotional processing can reliably track moral facts after a suitable\nkind of implicit learning. They draw on empirical work on the\ndevelopment of expertise. In implicit learning, the learner,\nsuch as a novice nurse, is repeatedly exposed to certain cues, (such\nas babies manifesting different symptoms), makes certain decisions to\nact (giving certain kind of treatment to the baby), and then receives\nclear, independent feedback on whether the decisions were correct (the\nsymptoms either go away or get worse) (Kahneman and Klein 2009). As a\nresult, the learner may become an expert, who is able to respond\nimmediately and appropriately to situations without necessarily being\nable to articulate why. Allman and Woodward\u2019s suggestion is that\na similar kind of training of our emotional responses is possible in\nthe moral case.\n\nMore recently, Peter Railton has also highlighted conceptions of the\naffective system as \u201ca flexible, experience-based\ninformation-processing system quite capable of tracking statistical\ndependencies and of guiding behavioral selection via the balancing of\ncosts, benefits, and risks\u201d (2014, 833) Just as laboratory rats\nhave been found to develop action-guiding forward models that\nimplicitly represent expected values of their options, our feelings\ncan be attuned to possible rewards and punishments, and can be\nexpected to color our evaluative perception.\n\nThe core challenge for this type of view is that there is a difference\nbetween training emotions to be responsive to potentially morally\nrelevant information, such as\n\n\nmental states of others and their likely behavior in interactive\nsituations, as well as the likely consequences of such behaviour\n(Allman and Woodward 2008: 173),\n\n\nand training them to be responsive to moral facts themselves.\nIt is not clear whether there is any analogue to the unambiguous and\nindependent negative feedback that a nurse receives after giving the\nwrong treatment in the case of making a mistaken moral judgment.\nRailton suggests that empathy might play such a role, noting that\nhaving a capacity to empathize and activating it in situ\n\u201cappear [\u2026] to be important predictors of moral\nsensitivity and behavior\u201d (2014: 844), for example by inhibiting\nviolence. But while empathy can certainly give feedback about the\n(anticipated) responses of others, it is one thing to learn that\nothers as a matter of fact, say, suffer because of or\ndisapprove of what I did, and quite another to learn that such\ndisapproval is merited. To attune affective responses to\nmoral facts, it seems that it is the latter kind of feedback we would\nneed.\n",
