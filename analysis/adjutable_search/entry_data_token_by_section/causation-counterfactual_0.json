    "main_text": "Lewis\u2019s 1973 Counterfactual Analysis\n1. Lewis\u2019s 1973 Counterfactual Analysis\n\nThe guiding idea behind counterfactual analyses of causation is the\nthought that \u2013 as David Lewis puts it \u2013 \u201cWe think of\na cause as something that makes a difference, and the difference it\nmakes must be a difference from what would have happened without it.\nHad it been absent, its effects \u2013 some of them, at least, and\nusually all \u2013 would have been absent as well\u201d (1973b,\n161).\n\nThe first explicit definition of causation in terms of counterfactuals\nwas, surprisingly enough, given by Hume, when he wrote: \u201cWe may\ndefine a cause to be an object followed by another, and where all\nthe objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to\nthe second. Or, in other words, where, if the first object had\nnot been, the second never had existed\u201d (1748, Section VII).\nIt is difficult to understand how Hume could have confused the first,\nregularity definition with the second, very different counterfactual\ndefinition (though see Buckle 2004: 212\u201313 for a brief\ndiscussion).\n\nAt any rate, Hume never explored the alternative counterfactual\napproach to causation. In this, as in much else, he was followed by\ngenerations of empiricist philosophers. The chief obstacle in\nempiricists\u2019 minds to explaining causation in terms of\ncounterfactuals was the obscurity of counterfactuals themselves, owing\nchiefly to their reference to unactualised possibilities. The true\npotential of the counterfactual approach to causation did not become\nclear until counterfactuals became better understood through the\ndevelopment of possible world semantics in the early 1970s.\n\nThe best known and most thoroughly elaborated counterfactual theory of\ncausation is David Lewis\u2019s theory in his (1973b). Lewis\u2019s\ntheory was refined and extended in articles subsequently collected in\nhis (1986a). In response to doubts about the theory\u2019s treatment\nof preemption, Lewis subsequently proposed a fairly radical revision\nof the theory (2000/2004a). In this section we shall confine our\nattention to the original 1973 theory, deferring the later changes he\nproposed for consideration below.\n\n",
