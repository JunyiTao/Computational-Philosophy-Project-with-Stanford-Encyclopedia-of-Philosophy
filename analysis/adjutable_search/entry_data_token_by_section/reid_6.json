    "main_text": "Conception || Non-Existent Objects\n2.4 Non-Existent Objects\n\n\nReid believes that we can conceive of non-existent objects. This does\nnot appear to comport with his alleged common-sense philosophy,\ncreating an interesting conundrum for Reid interpreters. The best\napproach to understanding why Reid says we can conceive of\nnon-existent objects is to put this in the context of Reid's\nopposition to skepticism. In the face of \u2018veil of conception\u2019\nskepticism, Reid is intent on defending the transparency and\nself-knowledge of our thoughts. This leads him to argue that we can\nconceive of non-existent, fictional objects: \u201cI conceive a\ncentaur. This conception is an operation of the mind, of which I am\nconscious, and to which I can attend. The sole object of it is a\ncentaur, an animal which, I believe, never existed\u201d (EIP 4.2,\n321; see EIP 2.12, 160). Suppose when I think I am conceiving of a\ncentaur, I am conceiving of something else, like an image of a\ncentaur. If so, then I do not know the contents of my thoughts. This\nyields skepticism about the contents of my thoughts, which Reid\nbelieves is false. So, by reductio he concludes that we are able to\nconceive of objects that do not exist.\n\n\nThe factual claim that I know what I am thinking appears to be\nobviously true insofar as anyone familiar with the meaning of\n\u2018centaur\u2019 conceives of centaurs when reading sentences that predicate\nproperties of centaurs. Representational theories of thought like the\nWay of Ideas imply in this case that I do not conceive of centaurs\nbut rather I conceive of mental representations of\ncentaurs\u2014images of them or words about them (EIP 4.2,\n312). But Reid is asserting something different: I conceive of a\ncentaur itself\u2014not a mental representation of a\ncentaur. Appreciating this point is necessary for understanding how\nstrange Reid's theory appears to be.\n\n\nReid understands the Way of Ideas' error theory of the conception of a\ncentaur: \u201cThe [proponent of the Way of Ideas] says, I cannot\nconceive a centaur without having an idea of it in my mind.... Perhaps\nhe will say, that the idea is an image of the animal, and is the\nimmediate object of my conception, and that the animal is the mediate\nor remote object.\u201d Reid first responds that when he introspects\nhe is aware of only one object of conception, not two. Second, the\nobject of conception, he writes,\nis not the image of an animal\u2014it is an animal. I\nknow what it is to conceive an image of an animal, and what it is to\nconceive an animal... The thing I conceive is a body of a certain\nfigure and colour, having life and spontaneous motion. The philosopher\nsays, that the idea is an image of the animal; but that it has neither\nbody, nor colour, nor life, nor spontaneous motion. This I am not able\nto comprehend. (EIP 4.2, 321\u20132)\n\n\nEven in difficult cases of thoughts about things like centaurs or\ncircles (EIP 4.3, 323\u20134), their intentional contents are so\ntransparent in a moment's reflection that we can identify them without\nmistake. Reid presses this epistemological point into heavy service in\nthe context of the conception of non-existent objects. As with Reid's\nappeal to the irreducible intentionality of conception, Reid's\nposition regarding the conception of non-existent objects has proven\nchallenging to explain and to defend, but starts have been made (David\n1985\u20136; Nichols 2002). Though his commitment to the importance of\nself-knowledge and the transparency of thought is obvious, Reid\njeopardizes his allegiance to common sense by asserting we think of\nnon-existent objects directly and without thinking of a mental\nintermediary.\n",
