    "main_text": "Key Features of Natural Law Theories || Paradigmatic and nonparadigmatic natural law theories\n1.4 Paradigmatic and nonparadigmatic natural law theories\n\nTo summarize: the paradigmatic natural law view holds that (1) the\nnatural law is given by God; (2) it is naturally authoritative over\nall human beings; and (3) it is naturally knowable by all human\nbeings. Further, it holds that (4) the good is prior to the right,\nthat (5) right action is action that responds nondefectively to the\ngood, that (6) there are a variety of ways in which action can be\ndefective with respect to the good, and that (7) some of these ways\ncan be captured and formulated as general rules.\n\nAquinas was not the only historically important paradigmatic natural\nlaw theorist. Thomas Hobbes, for example, was also a paradigmatic\nnatural law theorist. He held that the laws of nature are divine law\n(Leviathan, xv, \u00b641), that all humans are bound by them\n(Leviathan, xv, \u00b6\u00b636), and that it is easy to know\nat least the basics of the natural law (Leviathan, xv,\n\u00b635). He held that the fundamental good is self-preservation\n(Leviathan, xiii, \u00b614), and that the laws of nature\ndirect the way to this good (Leviathan, xiv, \u00b63). He offered a\ncatalog of laws of nature that constitute the \u201ctrue moral\nphilosophy\u201d (Leviathan, xv, \u00b640). There are also a\nnumber of contemporary writers that affirm the paradigmatic view.\nThese writers, not surprisingly, trace their views to Aquinas as the\nmajor influence, though they do not claim to reproduce his views in\ndetail. (See, for example, Grisez 1983, Finnis 1980,\u00a0 MacIntyre\n1999, and Murphy 2001.)\n\nIt is also easy to identify a number of writers, both historical and\ncontemporary, whose views are easily called natural law views, through\nsharing all but one or two of the features of Aquinas\u2019s\nparadigmatic position. Recently there have been nontheistic writers in\nthe natural law tradition, who deny (1): see, for example, the work of\nMichael Moore (1982, 1996) and Philippa Foot (2001). There were a\nnumber of post-Thomistic writers in the medieval and modern periods\nwho in some way denied (2), the natural authority of the natural law,\nholding that while the content of the natural law is fixed\neither wholly or in part by human nature, its preceptive\npower could only come from an additional divine command: the\nviews of John Duns Scotus, Francisco Suarez, and John Locke fit this\nmold.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arguably the Stoics were natural law thinkers,\nbut they seem to deny (4), holding the right to be prior to the good\n(see Striker 1986). Some contemporary theological ethicists called\n\u2018proportionalists\u2019 (e.g. Hallett 1995) have taken up the\nnatural law view with a consequentialist twist, denying (6). (For a\ndiscussion of the relationship between proportionalism and natural law\ntheory see Kaczor 2002.) And while some see Aristotle as being the\nsource of the natural law tradition, some have argued that his central\nappeal to the insight of the person of practical wisdom as setting the\nfinal standard for right action precludes the possibility of the sort\nof general rules that would (at least in a theistic context) make\nAristotle\u2019s ethics a natural law position. There is of course no\nclear answer to the question of when a view ceases to be a natural law\ntheory, though a nonparadigmatic one, and becomes no natural law\ntheory at all.\n",
