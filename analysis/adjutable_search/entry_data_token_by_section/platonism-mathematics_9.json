    "main_text": "The Fregean Argument for Existence || Defending Truth\n2.3 Defending Truth\n\nTruth can be defended in a variety of different ways.\nCommon to all defenses is that they first identify some standard by\nwhich the truth-values of mathematical statements can be assessed and\nthen argue that mathematical theorems meet this standard.\n\nOne option is to appeal to a standard that is more fundamental than\nthat of mathematics itself. Logicism provides an example. Frege and\nother logicists first claim that any theorem of pure logic is true.\nThen they attempt to show that the theorems of certain branches of\nmathematics can be proved from pure logic and definitions alone.\n\nAnother option is to appeal to the standards of empirical science. The\nQuine-Putnam indispensability argument provides an example. First it\nis argued that any indispensable part of empirical science is likely\nto be true and therefore something we are justified in believing. Then\nit is argued that large amounts of mathematics are indispensable to\nempirical science. If both claims are correct, it follows that\nTruth is likely to be true and that belief in\nTruth therefore is justified. (See the entry on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nA third option is to appeal to the standards of mathematics itself.\nWhy should one have to appeal to non-mathematical standards, such as\nthose of logic or empirical science, in order to defend the truth of\nmathematical theorems? When we defend the truth of the claims of logic\nand physics, we do not need to appeal to standards outside of\nrespectively logic and physics. Rather we assume that logic and\nphysics provide their own sui generis standards of\njustification. Why should mathematics be any different? This third\nstrategy has received a lot of attention in recent years, often under\nthe heading of \u2018naturalism\u2019 or \u2018mathematical\nnaturalism\u2019. (See Burgess & Rosen 1997, Maddy 1997, and, for\ncritical discussion, see the entry on\n naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nHere is an example of how a naturalistic strategy can be developed.\nCall the attitude that mathematicians take to the theorems of\nmathematics \u2018acceptance\u2019. Then the following claims seem\nplausible:\n\n(2)\nMathematicians are justified in accepting the theorems of\nmathematics.\n(3)\nAccepting a mathematical statement \\(S\\) involves taking \\(S\\) to\nbe true.\n(4)\nWhen a mathematician accepts a mathematical statement \\(S\\), the\ncontent of this attitude is in general the literal meaning of\n\\(S\\).\n\n\nFrom these three claims it follows that mathematical experts are\njustified in taking the theorems of mathematics to be literal truths.\nBy extension the rest of us too are justified in believing\nTruth. Note that the experts with whom (2) is\nconcerned need not themselves believe (3) and (4), let alone be\njustified in any such belief. What matters is that the three claims\nare true. The task of establishing the truth of (3) and (4) may fall\nto linguists, psychologists, sociologists, or philosophers, but\ncertainly not to mathematicians themselves.\n\nAdmittedly, fictionalists about mathematics will try to resist (3) or\n(4). See Field (1982), Yablo (2005), Leng (2010), as well as the entry\non\n fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics.\n \n",
