    "main_text": "Knowledge and certification\n3. Knowledge and certification\n\nThe target of epistemological evaluations in classical India is not\nbelief but rather cognition, which, however, like belief in the West,\nis viewed as propositional. Buddhists, Naiy\u0101yikas,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, and others address the issue of how a\nproposition-laden cognition is known to be true, or false, for that\nmatter. Against M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas in particular,\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba advances an \u201cextrinsicality\u201d position.\nAlthough presumptive presentations of \u201cfresh news\u201d through\nany of the sources\u2014perception and the others\u2014are naturally\nand automatically taken to be veridical, according to\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Ny\u0101ya, it takes a separate cognitive\nact to determine whether a cognition is knowledge or\n\u201cnon-knowledge.\u201d An awareness, an \u201cexperience\u201d\n(anubhava, a term used technically in the system), defined as\nwhat a person takes to be presentation of news\u2014i.e., takes\nautomatically to be new information\u2014is presumptively knowledge\nbut on occasion is either false or not produced by a genuine knowledge\nsource, perception, inference, or testimony (analogy is, for\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, restricted to learning the meaning of words).\nAccording to M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, certification is intrinsic\nto the apparent presentation. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s refutation\ncenters on an alleged phenomenology of doubt and knowing that one\nknows. If the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka position were correct, it\nwould not be possible to doubt the veridicality of, for example, a\nperception that is indeed an instance of knowledge, both veridical and\nproduced in the right way. But it is possible, he says.\n\nCertification happens through source identification, and the sources\nare known mainly by inference from certain tell-tale signs called\n\u201cmerits,\u201d gu\u1e47a, while falsification occurs\nthrough recognizing tell-tale signs of pseudo-sources called\n\u201cflaws,\u201d do\u1e63a. Various fallacies, for\nexample, are flaws with respective to putative knowledge as determined\nby way of inference. In certain cases, however, in contrast to the\nnorm, there is practically self-certification, as the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas claim. For example, perception is like that\nwith knowing that there is a small piece of \u0101malaka\nfruit in the palm of your hand. Much discussion throughout the\nJewel centers on certification conditions, some of which\nfigure in the definitions of the several sources. There is also much\nconcern with specification of the trigger, or triggers, of the\nworkings of the sources, which not only can serve to define them but\nwhose identification is one way certification proceeds.\n",
