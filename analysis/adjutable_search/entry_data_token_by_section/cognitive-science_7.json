    "main_text": "Theoretical Approaches || Analogies\n4.4 Analogies\n\nAnalogies play an important role in human thinking, in areas as\ndiverse as problem solving, decision making, explanation, and\nlinguistic communication. Computational models simulate how people\nretrieve and map source analogs in order to apply them to target\nsituations. The explanation schema for analogies is:\n\nExplanation target:\n\nWhy do people have a particular kind of intelligent behavior?\n Explanatory pattern:\n\nPeople have verbal and visual representations of situations that\ncan be used as cases or analogs.\nPeople have processes of retrieval, mapping, and adaptation that\noperate on those analogs.\nThe analogical processes, applied to the representations of\nanalogs, produce the behavior.\n\n\n\nThe constraints of similarity, structure, and purpose overcome the\ndifficult problem of how previous experiences can be found and used to\nhelp with new problems. Not all thinking is analogical, and using\ninappropriate analogies can hinder thinking, but analogies can be\neffective in applications such as education and design.\n",
