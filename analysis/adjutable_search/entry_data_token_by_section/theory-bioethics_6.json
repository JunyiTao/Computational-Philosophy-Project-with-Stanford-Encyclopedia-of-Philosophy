    "main_text": "What is the Nature of Applied Ethics? || Applied Ethics and Rule Application\n2.3 Applied Ethics and Rule Application\n\nMacIntyre tells us that applied ethics cannot be the sort of activity\nit is commonly supposed to be. He turns our attention to the\ncomplexities surrounding the notion of what it would mean to apply a\nmoral rule. If applied ethics is in fact an application to cases of\nthe rules of morality, we should expect to find that disagreements\nover moral rules reproduce themselves within debates on matters of\npractical ethics. But in a high proportion of cases these theoretical\ndisagreements, of which there are plenty, are not in fact replicated.\nLarge disagreement on what are the rules of morality turn out to be\ncompatible with large agreement within the domain of applied ethics.\nNoting how common such situations are (situations in which clear\ndisagreement exists on what are the rules of morality, while fairly\neasy agreement can be reached on concrete moral issues), MacIntyre\nholds that it cannot be the case that we first and independently\ncomprehend the rules of morality and then secondly enquire as to their\napplication under particular circumstances.\n\nAs MacIntyre has it, no rule exists apart from its application (and he\nadmits that his argument entails the rejection of any conception of\nmoral principles or rules as timeless and ahistorical). Often times,\nhe suggests, it appears as though agreements among a group of decision\nmakers is being reached through rational argumentation, but in fact\noften group members are reopening debates about perennial\nphilosophical questions. This is particularly so in medical ethics,\nMacIntyre tells us. Our common conception of applied ethics does\nindeed rest on a mistake (MacIntyre 1984).\n",
