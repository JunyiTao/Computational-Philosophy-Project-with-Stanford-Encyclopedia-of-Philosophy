    "main_text": "Character, Wellbeing, Emotion, and Moral Standing || Character and Virtue\n3.1 Character and Virtue\n\nA virtue is a complex disposition comprising sub-dispositions to\nnotice, construe, think, desire, and act in characteristic ways. To be\ngenerous, for instance, is (among other things) to be disposed to\nnotice occasions for giving, to construe ambiguous social cues\ncharitably, to desire to give people things they want, need, or would\nappreciate, to deliberate well about what they want, need, or would\nappreciate, and to act on the basis of such deliberation.\nManifestations of such a disposition are observable and hence ripe for\nempirical investigation. Virtue ethicists of the last several decades\nhave sometimes been optimistic about the distribution of virtue in the\npopulation. Alasdair MacIntyre claims, for example, that\n\u201cwithout allusion to the place that justice and injustice,\ncourage and cowardice play in human life very little will be genuinely\nexplicable\u201d (1984: 199). Julia Annas\n(2011: 8\u201310) claims that \u201cby the time we reflect\nabout virtues, we already have some.\u201d Linda Zagzebski (2010)\nprovides an \u201cexemplarist\u201d semantics for virtue terms that\nonly gets off the ground if there are in fact many virtuous\npeople.\n\nStarting with Owen Flanagan\u2019s Varieties of Moral\nPersonality (1993), philosophers began to worry that empirical\nresults from social psychology were inconsistent with the structure of\nhuman agency presupposed by virtue theory. In this framework, people\nare conceived as having more or less fixed traits of character that\nsystematically order their perception, cognition, emotion, reasoning,\ndecision-making, and behavior. For example, a generous person is\ninclined to notice and seek out opportunities to give supererogatorily\nto others. The generous person is also inclined to think about what\nwould (and wouldn\u2019t) be appreciated by potential recipients, to\nfeel the urge to give and the glow of satisfaction after giving, to\ndeliberate effectively about when, where, and how to give to whom, to\ncome to firm decisions based on such deliberation, and to follow\nthrough on those decisions once they\u2019ve been made. Other traits\nare meant to fit the same pattern, structuring perception, cognition,\nmotivation, and action of their bearers. Famous results in social\npsychology, such as Darley and Batson\u2019s (1973) Good Samaritan\nexperiment, seem to tell against this view of human moral conduct.\nWhen someone helps another in need, they may do so simply because they\nare not in a rush, rather than because they are expressing a fixed\ntrait like generosity or compassion.\n\nIn the virtue-theoretic framework, people are not necessarily assumed\nto already be virtuous. However, they are assumed to be at least\npotentially responsive to the considerations that a virtuous person\nwould ordinarily notice and take into account. Flanagan (1993),\nfollowed by Doris (1998, 2002, in press), Harman (1999, 2000), and\nAlfano (2013), made trouble for this framework by pointing to social\npsychological evidence suggesting that much of people\u2019s\nthinking, feeling, and acting is instead predicted by (and hence\nresponsive to) situational factors that don\u2019t seem to count as\nreasons at all\u2014not even bad reasons or temptations to vice.\nEarly discussions of these situational factors\nemphasized influences such as ambient sensibilia (sounds, smells,\nlight levels, etc.), seemingly trivial and normatively irrelevant\ninducers of positive and negative moods, order of presentation of\nstimuli, and a variety of framing and priming effects, many of which\nare reviewed in Alfano (2013:\n 40\u201350).[7] \n It\u2019s\n worth emphasizing the depth of the problem these studies appeared\nto pose. It\u2019s not that they suggest that most people\naren\u2019t virtuous (although they do suggest that as well).\nIt\u2019s that they suggest that they undermine the entire framework\nin which people are conceived as cognitively sensitive and\nmotivationally responsive to reasons. Someone whose failure to act\nvirtuously because they gave in to temptation can be understood in the\nvirtue-theoretic framework. Someone whose failure to act virtuously\nbecause they\u2019d just been subliminally primed with physical\ncoldness, which in turn is metaphorically associated with social\ncoldness, finds no place in the virtue-theoretic framework. These\nsorts of effects push us to revamp our whole notion of agency and\npersonhood (Doris 2015).\n\nSome of the most surprising findings touted by critics of virtue\nethics (e.g., social priming) now appear to be\nunreplicable (for discussion, see Alfano 2018), but this outcome\ndoes not provide much solace to virtue theorists. Early estimates\nsuggested that individual difference variables typically explain less\nthan 10% of the variance in people\u2019s behavior (Mischel\n1968)\u2014though, as Funder and Ozer (1983) pointed out, situational\nfactors may explain less than\n 16%.[8]\n More recent aggregated evidence indicates that situational factors\nexplain approximately twice as much of the variance in human behavior\nas the five main trait factors (Rauthmann et al. 2014). Convergent\nevidence from both lexicographical and survey studies indicates that\nthere are at least five dimensions of situations that reliably predict\nthought, feeling, and behavior: (1) negative valence, (2) adversity,\n(3) duty, (4) complexity, and (5) positive valence (Rauthmann and\nSherman 2018).\n\nAccording to Doris (2002, in press), the best explanation of this lack\nof cross-situational consistency is that the great majority of people\nhave local rather than global, traits: they are not honest,\ncourageous, or greedy, but they may be honest-while-in-a-good-mood,\ncourageous-while-sailing-in-rough-weather-with-friends, and\ngreedy-unless-watched-by-fellow-parishioners. In contrast, Christian\nMiller (2013, 2014) thinks the evidence is best explained by a theory\nof mixed global traits, such as the disposition to (among other\nthings) help because it improves one\u2019s mood. Such traits are\nglobal, in the sense that they explain and predict behavior across\nsituations (someone with such a disposition will, other things being\nequal, typically help so long as it will maintain her mood), but\nnormatively mixed, in the sense that they are neither virtues nor\nvices. Mark Alfano (2013) goes in a third direction, arguing that\nvirtue and vice attributions tend to function as self-fulfilling\nprophecies. People tend to act in accordance with the traits that are\nattributed to them, whether the traits are minor virtues such as\ntidiness (Miller, Brickman, & Bolen 1975) and ecology-mindedness\n(Cornelissen et al. 2006, 2007), major virtues such as charity (Jensen\n& Moore 1977), cooperativeness (Grusec et al. 1978), and\ngenerosity (Grusec & Redler 1980), or vices such as cutthroat\ncompetitiveness (Grusec et al. 1978). On Alfano\u2019s view,\nwhen people act in accordance with a virtue, they often do so not\nbecause they possess the trait in question, but because they think\nthey do or because they know that other people think they do. He calls\nsuch simulations of moral character factitious virtues, and\neven suggests that the notion of a virtue should be revised to include\nreflexive and social\n expectations.[9]\n\nIt might seem that the criticisms that motivate these novel approaches\nto virtue miss their mark. After all, virtue ethicists needn\u2019t\n(and often don\u2019t) commit themselves to the claim that almost\neveryone is virtuous. Instead, many argue that virtue is the\nnormative goal of moral development, and that people mostly fail in\nvarious ways to reach that goal. The argument from the fact that most\npeople\u2019s dispositions are not virtues to a rejection of orthodox\nvirtue ethics, then, might be thought a non sequitur, at\nleast for such views. But empirically-minded critics of virtue ethics\ndo not stop there. They all have positive views about what sorts of\ndispositions people have instead of virtues. These\ndispositions are alleged to be so structurally dissimilar from virtues\n(as traditionally understood) that it may be psychologically\nunrealistic to treat (traditional) virtue as a regulative ideal. What\nmatters, then, is the width of the gap between the descriptive and the\nnormative, between the (structure of the) dispositions most people\nhave and the (structure of the) dispositions that count as\nvirtues.\n\nThree leading defenses against this criticism have been offered. Some\nvirtue ethicists (Kupperman 2009) have conceded that virtue is\nextremely rare, but argued that it may still be a useful regulative\nideal. Others (Hurka 2006; Merritt 2000) have attempted to weaken\nthe concept of virtue in such a way as to enable more people, or at\nleast more behaviors, to count as virtuous. Still others (Kamtekar\n2004; Russell 2009; Snow 2010; Sreenivasan 2002) have\nchallenged the situationist evidence or its interpretation. While it\nremains unclear whether these defenses succeed, grappling with the\nsituationist challenge has led both defenders and challengers of\nvirtue ethics to develop more nuanced and empirically informed\n views.[10]\n",
