    "main_text": "Transcending the Human Conditions of Conflict || Asceticism and the Denial of the Will-to-Live\n5.3 Asceticism and the Denial of the Will-to-Live\n\nAccording to Schopenhauer, aesthetic perception offers only a\nshort-lived transcendence from the daily world. Neither is moral\nawareness the ultimate state of mind, despite its comparative tranquillity in contrast to the\ndaily world of violence. Schopenhauer\nbelieves that a person who experiences the truth of human nature from\na moral perspective \u2013 who appreciates how spatial and temporal\nforms of knowledge generate a constant passing away, continual\nsuffering, vain striving and inner tension \u2013 will be so repulsed\nby the human condition and by the pointlessly striving Will of which\nit is a manifestation, that he or she will lose the desire to affirm\nthe objectified human situation in any of its manifestations. The\nresult is an attitude of denial towards our will-to-live that\nSchopenhauer identifies with an ascetic attitude of renunciation,\nresignation, and will-lessness, but also with composure and\ntranquillity. In a manner reminiscent of traditional Buddhism, he\nrecognizes that life is filled with unavoidable frustration and\nacknowledges that the suffering caused by this frustration can itself\nbe reduced by minimizing one\u2019s desires. Moral consciousness and\nvirtue thus give way to the voluntary poverty and chastity of the\nascetic. St. Francis of Assisi (WWR, Section 68) and Jesus\n(WWR, Section 70) subsequently emerge as Schopenhauer\u2019s\nprototypes for the most enlightened lifestyle, in conjunction with the\nascetics from every religious tradition.\n\nThis emphasis upon the ascetic consciousness and its associated\ndetachment and tranquillity introduces some paradox into\nSchopenhauer\u2019s outlook, for he admits that the denial of our\nwill-to-live entails a terrible struggle with instinctual energies, as\nwe avoid the temptations of bodily pleasures and resist the mere\nanimal force to endure, reproduce, and flourish. Before we can enter the\ntranscendent consciousness of heavenly tranquillity, we must pass\nthrough the fires of hell and experience a dark night of the soul, as\nour universal self battles our individuated and physical self, as pure\nknowledge opposes animalistic will, and as freedom struggles\nagainst nature. \n\nOne can maintain superficially that no contradiction is involved in\nthe act of willing to deny the will-to-live,\nbecause one is not saying that Will is somehow destroying itself, but\nonly saying that a more universal manifestation of Will is\noverpowering a less universal manifestation, namely, the natural,\nindividuated, physically-embodied aspect. Within this opposition, it\ndoes remain that Will as a whole is set against itself according to\nthe very model Schopenhauer is trying to transcend, namely, the model\nwherein one manifestation of Will fights against another\nmanifestation, like the divided bulldog ant. This in itself may not be a\nproblem, but the location of the tormented and self-crucifying ascetic\nconsciousness at the penultimate level of enlightenment is\nparadoxical, owing to its high degree of inner ferocity. Even though\nthis ferocity occurs at a reflective and introspective level, we have\nbefore us a spiritualized life-and-death struggle within the ascetic\nconsciousness.\n\nThis peculiarity notwithstanding, the ascetic\u2019s struggle is none\nother than a supreme struggle against human nature. It is a struggle\nagainst the close-to-unavoidable tendency to apply the principle of\nsufficient reason for the purpose of attaining practical knowledge\n\u2013 an application that for Schopenhauer has the repulsive\nside-effect of creating the illusion, or nightmare, of a world\npermeated with endless conflict. From a related angle, the\nascetic\u2019s struggle is against the forces of violence and evil,\nthat, owing to Schopenhauer\u2019s acceptance and interpretation of\nKant\u2019s epistemology, locates these forces significantly within\nhuman nature itself. When the ascetic transcends human nature, the\nascetic resolves the problem of evil: by removing the individuated and\nindividuating human consciousness from the scene, the entire\nspatio-temporal situation within which daily violence occurs is\nremoved. \n\nIn a way, then, the ascetic consciousness can be said symbolically to\nreturn Adam and Eve to Paradise, for it is the very quest for\nknowledge (i.e., the will to apply the principle of individuation to\nexperience) that the ascetic overcomes. This amounts to a\nself-overcoming at the universal level, where not only physical\ndesires are overcome, but where humanly-inherent epistemological\ndispositions are overcome as well.\n",
