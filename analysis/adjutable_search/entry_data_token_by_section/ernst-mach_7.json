    "main_text": "Philosophy of Science || Historical Critique\n4.1 Historical Critique\n\n\nMach wrote a number of widely read science history texts; in a sense\nthey are archaeologies of science, digging at the past to critically\nelucidate the present. Machian history can also be seen in the context\nof German nineteenth century thought; Hegel, David Strauss, Nietzsche,\nand Marx all offered historical frameworks for their various\nsocial-philosophical positions. They also saw their own critiques as\nplaying a crucial role in the new order that was to follow.  That is,\neach of their works placed itself at the juncture of history, where\ntheir writing self-consciously was to influence the next stage that it\nhad predicted. Certainly d\u2019Alembert, Herschel, Whewell, and Mill had\nwritten histories of science before Mach, but it was Mach who wrote\ncritical history in the above sense.  The interesting aspect of Mach\u2019s\ncritique was that it actually had an effect upon science. Science\nof Mechanics deserves mention in the history of physics.\n",
