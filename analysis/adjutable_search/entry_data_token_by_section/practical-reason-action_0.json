    "main_text": "The Calculative View of Action\n1. The Calculative View of Action\n\nThe most prominent advocates of the calculative view of action are\nCandace Vogler and Michael Thompson. We will start with Vogler\u2019s\nversion of the view, and proceed to Thompson\u2019s.\n\nCall psychologism the claim that the right way to do logic\nand theory of rationality more generally is first to figure out how\nthe mind works. Since the early seventies, almost all mainstream work\non practical reasoning has been psychologistic in this sense; a\nrepresentative example might be Michael Smith\u2019s argument for the\n\u2018Humean theory of motivation\u2019, which turns on what desires\n\u2013 a psychological state \u2013 are, and how they work (Smith\n1987). Vogler\u2019s treatment of practical rationality (Vogler 2002) is a\nsharp departure from the common approach, and an attempt to replicate\nin that field the anti-psychologistic turn which Frege and Husserl\nimparted to work on theoretical rationality in, respectively, the\nanalytic and Continental traditions. She takes herself to be following\nG. E. M. Anscombe (Anscombe 1985, Vogler 2001), who was in turn\nfollowing Aquinas. (We won\u2019t take up the historical background to the\nbody of work under discussion here, but see the entry on\n medieval theories of practical reason.)\n\nVogler notices that instrumentalism \u2013 the view that all reasons\nfor action are means-end reasons \u2013 is the default view in\ncontemporary philosophy. There must, she infers, be a compelling\ninsight at the bottom of it; but instrumentalism has been much-refuted\nover the past few decades. What the many refutations of\ninstrumentalism really show, Vogler believes, is that formulating the\nunderlying insight psychologistically (as a thesis about mental\noperations and the mental states involved in them) results in weak and\nunsustainable renditions of it. She concludes that in order to\narticulate what instrumentalism is getting right, you have to strip\naway the psychologism. The point being emphasized just now is that the\nmotivation for this instance of the turn to action theory is\nanti-psychologism about practical rationality.\n\nOn one familiar reading of Frege (not the only reading, and we\u2019ll see\nan alternative to it shortly), the proper way to do logic is not to\nlook inward, as it were to the gears of the mind, but outward, to the\nlogical relations that hold between suitable abstract objects, and to\nread the correct inference patterns off of these. In the practical\nanalog of this move, when you look outward, away from the beliefs and\ndesires that preoccupy psychologistic theorists, what you find are\nactions, the external products of any successful deployment of\npractical reasons. So the logic of practical reasons is to be read off\nthe structure of actions in something like the way that, say,\ntruth-functional logic is to be read off the truth-functional\nrelations between propositions. This form of anti-psychologism\npreempts a worry one might have had about what was described at the\noutset as the organizing argument of the action-oriented approach. The\nproposal, recall, was to read the inference patterns off the structure\nof actions; if one were to construe this as reconstructing the process\nof practical reasoning from its product, how far would the\nreconstruction be likely to get? (Compare: there are many ways to make\na chair; you would not learn much about how chairs are fabricated by\nthinking about what chairs look like, or even about their conceptually\nnecessary features.) But Vogler\u2019s anti-psychologism insists that\nquestions about rationality are not questions about what\nprocesses of thought lead up to a decision.\n\nIntentional actions are picked out and segmented into their parts by\napplications of Anscombe\u2019s \u2018Why?\u2019-questions. (\u2018Why\nare you chopping the nuts?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m making a salad.\u2019)\nThe internal structure of actions is consequently a series of steps\ntowards a termination point (or \u2018end\u2019), a place where the\naction stops. When you make Deborah Madison\u2019s persimmon and\nhazelnut salad, you first coarsely chop the nuts; then you thinly\nslice three Fuyu persimmons crosswise and put them in a bowl along\nwith the nuts; then you add in three handfuls of trimmed watercress;\nthen you toss with the dressing \u2013 and you\u2019re done. A step can be\nshown to be rational by showing it to be a step on the way to the\ntermination point of the action that you are in the course of\nperforming. A step can be shown to be irrational by showing\nthat it\u2019s not: for instance, if you\u2019ve finished making the salad, but\nyou obsessively keep chopping nuts. Vogler allows that there may be\natomic actions, actions that do not have further actions as their\nparts; perhaps blinking is such an action. But just about any action\nwe care about will be a complex action (i.e., an action that has\nfurther actions as parts); and since we don\u2019t usually notice what we\ndon\u2019t care about, atomic actions, if there are any, are hard to come\nup with.\n\nVogler\u2019s \u2018calculative view\u2019 is accordingly that whenever\n(or perhaps, almost whenever) you have a reason to do\nsomething, you have a calculative reason, that is, a reason whose\nforce is: this is a step toward the termination point of my action.\nVogler distinguishes two subclasses: means-end reasons, and part-whole\nreasons; buying the cress is best thought of as a means to making the\nsalad, whereas chopping the nuts is properly part of making the salad.\nIt is not that she is insisting that there are no other sorts of\npractical consideration. In fact, she provides what she takes to be an\nexhaustive list of the logical forms the remaining sorts of\nconsiderations can have. (See Millgram 2006 for a brief overview.)\nRather, the claim is that when you have a reason of one of these\nfurther sorts, you must also have a calculative reason.\n\nThe connection only runs one way, however. Since considerations of\nother sorts organize, modulate and generally control actions, they\npresuppose calculative reasons. But calculative structures (and the\nreasons they give you) do not presuppose these other sorts of\nconsideration: you can just tie your shoes, and Vogler\nregards theories on which such actions must be informed by, for\nexample, a large-scale conception of the good as modeling rationality\non a psychopathology akin to paranoia. This asymmetry is what Vogler\ntakes to be the deep insight underlying instrumentalism. Because any\naction large enough to be something we care about must, if it is to\nwork, be calculatively well-formed, the means-end/part-whole\narticulation of actions is nonoptional, and consequently, we have to\npay due attention to calculative reasons. We cannot shrug off others\u2019\ncriticism of our calculative reasons, as we can shrug off their\ncriticism of, say, our pleasures. Calculative reasons are thus\nnonoptional, or binding.\n\nThis appeal to the structure of action as the foundation for practical\nrationality has dramatic consequences for substantive moral theory,\nand an easy way to see how is to consider a terminological puzzle\nraised by Vogler\u2019s presentation. She argues that her view is\ninternalist; Bernard Williams introduced the contrast between internal\nand external reasons via the connection, on the one hand, or lack of\nit, on the other, between reasons and an agent\u2019s motivational states\n(Williams 1981a); motivational states are part of an agent\u2019s\npsychology; so how can an anti-psychologistic position like Vogler\u2019s\nbe avowedly internalist? The answer to the terminological question has\nto do with Williams\u2019s own philosophical development. Following\nKorsgaard\u2019s attack on his view (Korsgaard 1996, ch. 11), Williams\nbegan (albeit without announcing the changeover) to use\n\u2018internalism\u2019 for the claim that reasons for action can\ndiffer from person to person; there\u2019s no level, however deep, at which\nthey must be the same. (Williams 1995, which gives a\nstill-psychologistic example: the alcoholic has a reason to lock up\nhis liquor cabinet and throw away the key; the virtuous person does\nnot; the explanation is that their characters rather than their\ndesires differ.) So Vogler is claiming her view to be internalist in\nthis newer sense: there are no reasons that have to be the same for\neverybody. Different people have different ends at different times;\nand since other sorts of reasons, she has argued, are optional, they\nvary from person to person as well. But if internalism is correct (and\nthis was what had interested Williams in the thesis in the first\nplace), then you can be, as the title of Vogler\u2019s book has it,\nreasonably vicious; immorality of even the most extreme kind need not\nentail irrationality.\n\nMichael Thompson\u2019s equally anti-psychologistic account of calculative\nrationality (Thompson 2008, Part II) reverses the direction of\nargument we have observed in Vogler. In the alternative reading of\nFrege which it uses as a template, what comes first is our grasp of\ninference; the inferences in the relevant part of the \u2013 as\nThompson occasionally puts it \u2013 \u201cpractical\nBegriffsschrift\u201d have actions as their subject matter.\nSo it is an account of action that is being read off the inference\npatterns (rather than the other way around), in something like the way\nthat Fregeans of this stripe take us to read the logical form of\npropositions off our command of truth-functional and quantificational\ninference. The direction of argument notwithstanding, Thompson belongs\nto the group of theorists we are considering, in that the objective of\nthe argument is to exploit an account of action in order to establish\na thesis about calculative practical reasons, namely, that those\nreasons are not psychological states such as desires or intentions.\n\n\nThe argumentative strategy is adapted from Sellars (1997, pp.\n37\u201341; it bears comparison to related arguments in Nagel, 1970,\npp. 29\u201331, and Brandom, 2001). A core practice, in this case of\nreason-giving, is identified, one that adduces only actions (and not\npsychological states); Thompson then exhibits the point of introducing\napparently psychological locutions (such as \u201cbecause I want\nto\u2026\u201d) into such a practice. The explanation is supposed\nto demonstrate that these locutions do not really name\nanything on the order of desires or intentions, but are rather a\nroundabout way of conveying information about the progress of an\nongoing course of action. We will first describe the way Thompson sets\nup the core practice, and then briefly reconstruct his argument for\nnon-psychologistic renderings of apparently psychologically oriented\nreason locutions. \n\nLike Vogler, Thompson uses Anscombian \u2018Why?\u2019-questions to\npick out intentional actions. He then draws our attention to the way\nthat grammatical aspect figures into their answers. Action\ndescriptions can be either perfective (\u201cI made the salad\u201d)\nor progressive (\u201cI\u2019m making the salad,\u201d \u201cI was\nmaking the salad\u201d). Notice that these grammatical forms are not\nmerely ornamental; they carry different implications. From the\nperfective \u201cI made a salad,\u201d it follows that at some point\nthere was a salad. From the progressive \u201cI was making a\nsalad,\u201d it doesn\u2019t follow: perhaps I was interrupted by a phone\ncall, and never got back to chopping. Thompson demarcates \u2018naive\nrationalizations\u2019 as those which deploy the progressive in\nplacing one action as part of another. (\u201cWhy are you chopping\nthe nuts?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m making a salad.\u201d) The contrast is\nwith \u2018sophisticated rationalizations\u2019, which seem to\ninvoke psychological states like desires (\u201cI want to\nmake a salad\u201d). \n\nWe can imagine a society (call it the action-theoretic state of\nnature) getting by with only naive rationalization. But there is\nroom for improvement in their practice of calculative reason-giving,\nand here\u2019s a short way to see how. Agents restricted to naive\nrationalizations will say \u201cI\u2019m Bing because I\u2019m\nAing,\u201d when Bing is an action that is a part\nof Aing, and they are Aing. But such parts of\nactions often come in sequence, one after another. So such an agent\ncan, at a particular time, be executing a containing action, i.e.,\nAing, but not executing a subsidiary action, Bing,\nif Bing is an action that is a part of Aing, but one\nwhich comes earlier or later on in the sequence. Now, if, at a\nparticular time, an agent is not executing an action (again,\nBing), then when someone asks if he\u2019s Bing, he\u2019ll\nsay he\u2019s not. So it\u2019s easy to put agents restricted to naive\nrationalizations in the position of saying both that they\u2019re\nBing, and that they\u2019re not Bing. (E.g., \u201cI\u2019m\nBing because I\u2019m Aing, but I\u2019m not\nBing.\u201d) That\u2019s potentially confusing. \n\nWe can suppose that such agents will adopt devices to obviate the\nconfusion. For instance, they\u2019ll learn to say (as we do), \u201cI\u2019m\nBing tomorrow.\u201d Against that background, however,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to B,\u201d \u201cI want to\nA,\u201d and so on are evidently similar devices, and of a\npiece with \u201cI\u2019m Bing tomorrow.\u201d Each such\nlocution carries a different sort of additional information. For\ninstance, \u201cI\u2019m going to B\u201d positions one as being\nin the very preliminary run-up phases of an action; when one says,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to B because I\u2019m Aing,\u201d one\nis giving a naive rationalization, but one which registers that the\nBing phase of Aing has not yet arrived, even though\nthe reason for the former is that it is part of the latter. Likewise,\n\u201cI intend to A\u201d places one merely at the planning\nphase of Aing; \u201cI want to A,\u201d allows\nthat one may be at a pre-planning phase. Briefly, the function of\nthese locutions is to preempt confusion by placing the actions that\nmake up a naive rationalization in their temporal sequence. But once\nwe see that that is their function, the temptation to\nconstrue them as invoking psychological states (intentions, desires\nand so on) is evidently misguided. Desires, in Thompson\u2019s Sellarsian\nview, are a mistake on a par with sense-data; just as the sense-datum\ntheorist treats a linguistic device for hedging one\u2019s commitments\n(\u201cIt appears to be\u2026\u201d) as naming a psychological\nstate (a mere appearance), so the belief-desire theorist of practical\nrationality is treating a linguistic device for sorting out the order\nof subsidiary actions (\u201c\u2026because I want\nto\u2026\u201d) as naming a motivating psychological state (a\ndesire). \n\nLike Vogler\u2019s calculative view, Thompson\u2019s account of calculative\npractical reasons is motivated by anti-psychologism. Unlike Vogler,\nhowever, he is not arguing for restricting the mandatory part of\npractical rationality to calculative reasons; other parts of Life\nand Action discuss very different but evidently nonoptional forms\nof practical inference. Vogler, we saw, was concessive about the\npossibility of atomic actions; Thompson gives a surprising argument to\nthe effect that all actions have further actions as their proper\nparts. (See Millgram 2009, sec. 9.4, for a brief reconstruction.) So\nalthough the two views are closely related, they also differ on many\npoints. \n",
