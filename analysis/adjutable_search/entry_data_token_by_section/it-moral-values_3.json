    "main_text": "The Moral Challenges of Information Technology || The Moral Paradox of Information Technologies\n2.2 The Moral Paradox of Information Technologies\n\nSeveral of the issues raised above result from the moral paradox of\nInformation technologies. Many users want information to be quickly\naccessible and easy to use and desire that it should come at as low a\ncost as possible, preferably free. But users also want important and\nsensitive information to be secure, stable and reliable. Maximizing\nour value of quick and low cost minimizes our ability to provide\nsecure and high quality information and the reverse is true also. Thus\nthe designers of information technologies are constantly faced with\nmaking uncomfortable compromises. The early web pioneer Stewart Brand\nsums this up well in his famous quote:\n\n\nIn fall 1984, at the first Hackers\u2019 Conference, I said in one\ndiscussion session: \u201cOn the one hand information wants to be\nexpensive, because it\u2019s so valuable. The right information in the\nright place just changes your life. On the other hand, information\nwants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower\nand lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each\nother\u201d (Clarke 2000\u2014see Other Internet\n Resources)[1]\n\n\n\nSince these competing moral values are essentially impossible to\nreconcile, they are likely to continue to be at the heart of moral\ndebates in the use and design of information technologies for the\nforeseeable future.\n",
