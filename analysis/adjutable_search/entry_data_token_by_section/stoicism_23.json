    "main_text": "Ethics || Virtue\n4.2 Virtue\n\nTo bring our mind into this state of agreement and achieve the\ntelos, the Stoics argue that only one thing is needed:\nvirtue. Virtue is the perfected condition of human reason (Seneca,\n63D), or \u201ca soul which has been fashioned to achieve consistency\n[or agreement, homologia] in the whole of life\u201d\n(Diogenes Laertius, 61A). Having developed her own power of reason to\nits fullest extent, the virtuous agent not only lives a life that is\nthe highest expression of human nature \u2013 the best possible\ncondition for a human being to be in, given the kind of creature we\nare \u2013 but also replicates in herself the condition of the divine\n(Seneca, 60H; Plutarch, 61J). To live virtuously is therefore to live\nin agreement with both human nature and cosmic or divine nature at\nonce (Chrysippus in Diogenes Laertius, 63C).\n\nSince virtue is the perfection of human rationality, and knowledge is\nthe highest rational achievement open to us, it is unsurprising that\nthe Stoics identify the virtues as forms of knowledge. The virtue of\ncourage, for instance, just is knowledge of what should be endured and\nfeared, and the Stoics argue that this virtue is inseparable from all\nthe rest: whoever has one virtue has them all (61B-H; see Schofield\n1984). Thus the knowledge that constitutes courage entails a\nsystematic grasp of further topics in ethics (e.g. of what should be\ndone and what is choiceworthy, the provinces of prudence and\nmoderation, respectively) and also, remarkably, of the truths of logic\nand physics as well (Cooper 1999a, Menn 1995; for an alternative view,\nsee Annas 1993). One cannot genuinely know (e.g.) what should be\nendured or feared without also knowing how knowledge itself is\nacquired (a topic in logic) and how nature operates in both human\nbeings and the cosmos at large (a topic in physics). The knowledge\nthat makes up virtue therefore ranges beyond the narrowly ethical, and\nsince knowledge is an all-or-nothing affair, so too is virtue\n(Plutarch, 61T). For the Stoics, comprehensive knowledge of reality\n(including but not limited to moral facts) is what is necessary and\nsufficient to live in agreement with nature and be happy.\n",
