    "main_text": "Formal Models || Multi-Level Evolution\n2.3 Multi-Level Evolution\n\nThe kind of levels involved in evolutionary epistemology are quite\ndifferent than the kind of levels of selection which are discussed\nmuch more often in the \u201clevels of selection\u201d debate in\nevolutionary biology. In evolutionary biology, the\n\u201clevels\u201d of selection under discussion are levels of\nscale. The debate concerns whether genes are always the\n\u201cunits\u201d or \u201ctargets\u201d of selection, or whether\nselection can occur on higher levels, like organisms, groups, and\nspecies. The levels involved in evolutionary epistemology, on the\nother hand, are levels of the regulatory hierarchy involved in the\ncontrol of behavior. These include the genetic bases of cognitive and\nperceptual hardware, concepts, languages, techniques, beliefs,\npreferences, and so forth. Note that in the case of evolutionary\nepistemology, the terms \u201clevels\u201d and\n\u201chierarchy\u201d may be impressionistic. There is often no\nclear arrangement of levels at all. \n\nThere are at least two different approaches that have been taken to\nmodeling multi-level evolution.\n\nDual Transmission Models: Boyd and Richerson (1985) adapted models\nfrom genetics to model a case in which a trait (cooperation) was\naffected both by genetic and cultural evolution. It was first shown\nthat a genetically determined bias on cultural transmission could be\nselected for in a migratory population. The bias made it easier to\npick up local customs, increasing the likelihood of imitation beyond\nthat determined by the frequency and perceived value of the behavior.\nOnce this bias was in place, its effect was strong enough to overcome\nthe perceived costs involved in cooperative behavior. The model\nyielded two important results. First, it provided a novel mechanism\naccording to which cooperative behavior can stabilize in migratory\npopulations. But more importantly, it demonstrated that cultural\nevolution cannot be predicted purely on the basis of genetic\nfitnesses.\nMultiple Population Models: Harms (1997) constructed a multi-level\ndynamic population model of bumblebee learning. Mutual information\nbetween distributions of sensor types, overt foraging behaviors, and\ninternal foraging preferences, on the one hand, and environmental\nstates, on the other, was assessed and compared to average fitness of\nthe population states. It was shown that information present in overt\nbehaviors may be underutilized, and that exaptation of sensor\nmechanisms for preference formation can bring about the utilization of\nthat information.\n\n",
