    "main_text": "The Created World\n3. The Created World\n\nThe mainstream of philosophical tradition as Aquinas knew it, running\nfrom Aristotle through the Greek commentators and into the Arabic\ntradition, held that the material world, and all the kinds of living\nthings in it, had always existed. These earlier Aristotelians still\nthought there was a place for God, as the first mover, but they\nunderstood God to be the initial, remote source of motions that had\nalways existed, rather than an eternal being who created the universe\nanew. Aquinas understood Christianity to be committed to the latter\nview. He holds that the changeable universe around us has existed for\nonly a finite amount of time; that God, in contrast, has existed\neternally and unchangingly; and that God freely chose to create the\nchangeable universe from nothing (ex nihilo). To bring a\nthing into existence ex nihilo is the defining feature of\n creation,\n in the strict sense of that term, and only God can do it (ST\n1a 45). Everything else in the natural world causes new things to come\ninto existence by modifying what is here already. The proper\nterminology for these natural changes is generation and\ncorruption, which refer to a substance\u2019s coming into or\ngoing out of existence by natural means, and alteration,\nwhich refers to a substance\u2019s undergoing accidental change:\ncontinuing to exist through change to its shape, color, and other\nnon-essential properties.\n\nAristotle and many of his followers believed they could prove that the\nworld had always existed. Conversely, many of Aquinas\u2019s\ncontemporaries thought they could prove the opposite, that the world\nhad to have a beginning in time, and the debate between these rival\nphilosophical accounts was one of the most acrimonious issues in the\nearly medieval university (Dales 1990). Aquinas took up the question\nin detail in his treatise On the Eternity of the World,\nconcluding that no demonstrative argument is possible either way. For\nall we can tell, God could have created the world in such a way that\nit had always existed. That we think otherwise is another deliverance\nof the faith, not susceptible to philosophical proof. This measured\nconclusion is characteristic of his thought in many domains. On the\none hand, he has complete confidence that philosophical reasoning,\nproperly pursued, will not yield results that are a threat to\nChristianity. On the other hand, he thinks it discredits the faith to\ndefend it through dubious attempts at demonstration. The key is to see\nwhere philosophy can be of service, and where it must give way to\nrevealed doctrine (Wippel 1995c; Kretzmann 1999 ch. 5).\n\nIt is not easy to think about God\u2019s relationship to the created\nworld, because without such a world there can be neither space nor\ntime (ST 1a 46.1, 46.3). Not space, because space is nothing\nmore than the existence of bodies, where bodies are beings that\npossess parts outside of parts, and so constitute the\nthree-dimensional extension that we think of as space. Accordingly,\nwhere there are no bodies there is no space. (Aquinas, following\nAristotle, denies that void space is coherent.) Not time, because\nAquinas accepts Aristotle\u2019s definition of time as the measure of\nmotion. In a world without motion, then, there is no time, which means\nthat the first moment of time was the first moment of the created\nworld. Although it is hard to resist thinking of God as having existed\n\u201cbefore\u201d there was a material universe, God\u2019s mode\nof existence, in a world without bodies, must be an existence outside\nof space and time. This need not entail, however, that God even now\nexists outside of space and time. God\u2019s\n omnipresence\n was commonly understood as a literal presence everywhere (Pasnau 2011\nch. 16), and Aquinas characterizes God\u2019s eternity not as a mode\nof existence outside of time, but as \u201cbeing present to every\ntime or instant of time\u201d (SCG I.66.8). It is, however,\nfar from clear what \u201cpresent\u201d amounts to in such a claim\n(Leftow 1990). These difficulties are of a piece with the general\ndifficulty we have in thinking about God using the concepts familiar\nto us from the world around us.\n\nHowever these metaphysical issues are resolved, it is clear that God\nis constantly, everywhere engaged with the world. Because \u201ca\nthing\u2019s existence cannot remain after the cessation of the\naction of the agent causing the effect\u201d (ST 1a 104.1c),\nthe created world must have not just an initial creative cause but\nalso an ongoing cause that\n conserves\n it from moment to moment. Since God is necessarily perfect, the\ncreated world cannot be beneficial for God, and since a universe with\na perfect being is itself already perfect, God\u2019s goodness does\nnot necessitate his creating anything at all. Moreover, since for\neverything God creates he could create something better (ST\n1a 25.6c), there is no sense to be made of the idea of a best of all\npossible worlds. Accordingly, God is free to create otherwise than he\ndid, and free even not to create anything at all: \u201cSince\nGod\u2019s goodness is perfect, and he can exist without other\nthings, \u2026 it follows that there is no absolute necessity that\nhe will things other than himself\u201d (ST 1a 19.3c).\nStill, creation has a purpose: God \u201cintends only to share his\nperfection, which is his goodness\u201d (ST 1a 44.4c). Among\ncreatures, those beings who possess intellects\u2014angels and human\nbeings\u2014are preeminent, in virtue of their capacity to love and\nunderstand their creator. Accordingly, the rest of creation is\norganized for their sake (SCG III.112). Ultimately, however,\nthe purpose of the created world is to reflect God\u2019s goodness\nand glory: \u201cthe whole universe, with its individual parts, is\nordered to God as its end, inasmuch as, by a kind of imitation, the\nuniverse represents divine goodness for the glory of God\u201d\n(ST 1a 65.2c). So it is that Aquinas takes everything in the\ncreated world to be subject to God\u2019s providential order\n(\u00a77). (For a broad study of Aquinas on creation see Kretzmann\n1999.)\n",
