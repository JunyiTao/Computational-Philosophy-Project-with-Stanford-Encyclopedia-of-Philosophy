    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind || Intentionality\n5.1 Intentionality\nThe fundamental thought behind Sellars\u2019s treatment of\nintentionality is that our concepts of intentionality and intentional\nstates are derived from concepts pertaining to linguistic behavior.\nNotice, this is not the claim that we always think in language or that\nwe learn to speak before we learn to think, which claims have\nmistakenly been attributed to Sellars.  Sellars is not engaged in\narmchair psychology but with what legitimates our use of psychological\nconcepts. \nThis approach to intentionality mobilizes Sellars\u2019s\nfunctionalist treatment of meaning.  Attributing a thought (hope,\nregret, desire \u2026) that p to someone is a complex affair.\nIn the first instance, such an attribution locates the relevant state\nof the person \u201cin the logical space of reasons.\u201d  This is to place the\nstate-type of the person within a vast network of possible intentional\nstate- and action-types related to each other by normative relations\nof inference, exclusion, relevance, and propriety.  But actual\nintentional state-types must be embodied in physical tokens, so\nattributing an intentional state to someone effectively attributes to\nthat person as well a behavioral control system that is so structured\nthat something analogous to theoretical and practical inference goes\non within it and, in this case, has a \u2022p\u2022 active in\nit in the appropriate way. Being active \u201cin the appropriate\nway\u201d within someone\u2019s behavioral control system will\ninclude participating in patterns of dispositions to infer and be\ninferred from other intentional states that mirror the patterns of\nrelationships in the logical space of reasons, as well being tied to\nsensory input and to output activities in appropriate ways.\nThis approach is incompatible with the traditional view that the\nmeaning of linguistic items is to be explained in terms of the\nthoughts they express.  This issue is the heart of Sellars\u2019s\ncorrespondence with Roderick Chisholm, published as\n\u201cIntentionality and the Mental\u201d [ITM].  Chisholm\nmaintained that reference to mental states is always implicit in\nsemantic statements and in our ability to comprehend the meanings of\nutterances.  Sellars demurs:\nThe argument presumes that the metalinguistic vocabulary\nin which we talk about linguistic episodes can be analysed in terms\nwhich do not presuppose the framework of mental acts; in particular\nthat\n\n\u201c\u2026\u201d means p\n\nis not to be analysed as\n\n\u201c\u2026\u201d expresses t and t is about\np where t is a thought. (ITM: 522)\nIn Sellars\u2019s view, thought is prior to language in the order\nof being, but language is prior to thought in the order of knowing.\nThat is, linguistic utterances are normally the product of internal\nthinking activity, which they express.  The Ryleans in Sellars\u2019s\nmyth have thoughts that are expressed in their utterances, but\nthey don\u2019t realize that they have such inner states.  They have\nthe notion of a meaningful utterance before generating the\nnotion of a meaningful thought, modeled on the former notion.\nThus, language is prior to thought in the order of knowing.\nIn his early work (see, e.g., EPM \u00a729), Sellars takes a hard\nline equating language possession and the ability to think, thereby denying thought to\ninfralinguals, but in later pieces, most notably SK and MEV, he\nmodifies this position.  He makes room for non-linguistic thought in\nhumans, recognizing that visual perception and imagination are\n\u201cin a sense most difficult to analyze, a thinking in color about\ncolored objects\u201d (SK I \u00a737: 305).  Then, in \u201cMental\nEvents,\u201d Sellars introduces a distinction\nbetween propositional form and\nlogical form that he did not utilize earlier.  \u201cTo have\npropositional form, a basic representational state must represent an\nobject and represent it as of a certain character\u201d (MEV: 336).\nItems in many non-linguistic representational systems such as maps\npossess propositional form by this characterization.  Logical form,\nhowever, is possessed by items that belong to representational systems\nthat include distinct symbols for logical operators.  In this late\nessay, Sellars acknowledges that animals possess representations with\npropositional form and can make, correspondingly, what Sellars calls\n\u201cHumean inferences,\u201d that is, material inferences that\nemploy no explicit generalization or logical principle.  His example\nis the move from \u201cSmoke here\u201d to \u201cFire\nnearby.\u201d Human representational systems possess logical form;\nthey enable us to engage in what he calls \u201cAristotelian\ninferences\u201d in which a general principle is explicitly\nrepresented: \u201cSmoke here.  Wherever there\u2019s smoke,\nthere\u2019s fire.  So, Fire nearby.\u201d This, Sellars claims, is\nthe crucial difference between animal and human: full-fledged thinkers\ncan recognize conditionality and generality as such, because\nthey possess explicit symbols for if\u2026then, all,\nand some.  \nSellars\u2019s treatment of intentionality has implications for\nfirst-person authority and the \u201cproblem of other minds.\u201d\nReports of one\u2019s own mental state cannot\nhave an intrinsic or absolute, apriori warrant, nor can privileged\naccessibility be the defining trait of the mental, as some have\nclaimed.  The extent and strength of first-person warrant rests\nultimately on the empirical reliability of such reports, just as the\nwarrant of observation reports does.  This extends as well to\nobservation reports concerning the mental states of others, for are\nnot we able, upon occasion, to see someone\u2019s joy or\nmisery?  The \u201cproblem of other minds\u201d never really gets\noff the ground in the context of Sellars\u2019s philosophy, for the\n\u201cconcepts pertaining to such inner episodes as thoughts are\nprimarily and essentially inter-subjective, as inter-subjective as the\nconcept of a positron, and ... the reporting role of these concepts\n\u2014 the fact that each of us has a privileged access to his\nthoughts \u2014 constitutes a dimension of the use of these concepts\nwhich is built on and presupposes this intersubjective status\u201d\n(EPM: \u00a759; in SPR: 189; in KMG: 269).\nSellars\u2019s treatment of mentalistic concepts as similar to\ntheoretical concepts has been cited as an inspiration for the\n\u201ctheory-theory\u201d in developmental psychology.  This is the\nnotion that the mechanisms we utilize to detect and attribute thoughts\nin ourselves and others operate via a kind of tacit theory application\nand that there is a developmental stage in children during which they\nacquire a \u201ctheory of mind\u201d and learn to apply it.  (See\nAstington et al. 1988; Gopnik and Wellman, 1994; Wellman, 1990;\nGarfield et al., 2001.)  This creative extension of Sellars\u2019s\nproposal is not something he is committed to; he is not engaged in\nempirical theorizing. \nSellars\u2019s treatment of mentalistic concepts has also inspired\neliminativist philosophies of mind such as that espoused by the\nChurchlands.  The idea is that if folk psychology is like a theory,\nthen, like any theory, it could be superseded and replaced by a better\ntheory as scientific psychology and neuroscience progress.  Sellars\nhimself, however, was unmoved by this idea, because the concepts of\nfolk psychology (of the manifest image) are not focused solely (or\nmaybe even principally) on the description and explanation of\nphenomena.  In the course of science, better descriptions of what is\ngoing on in our heads when we think and sense will be developed, but\nsuch descriptions could have only a part of the function of mentalistic\nlanguage.  The language of agency, to which we will shortly return, is\nindispensable and cannot be replaced by the language of any scientific\ntheory.  \n",
