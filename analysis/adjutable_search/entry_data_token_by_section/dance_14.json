    "main_text": "Additional Dance and Philosophy Connections || Dance, Ethics and Social-Political Philosophy\n5.3 Dance, Film and Digital Technology\n\nDance is developing in ways that include not just live, bodily\nperformances on stage but dance that is in digital, filmic and other\ntechnological or technologically-enhanced forms. New dance philosophy\n(as philosophy of these new dance arts) is emerging\naccordingly. Besides the short list of sources mentioned below the\nreader is encouraged to conduct dance philosophy research in film and\nemerging technology journals.\n\nDance philosophers who write on dance in film (or on film or filmic\ndance) include Brannigan 2014; Carroll 2001; McFee 2018; and Salzer\nand Baer 2015. Hetty Blades (2015a and 2015b) has written on dance,\nvirtual technology and scoring and her work centers on other forms of\ndance technology as well. For a piece on dance, ethics and technology\nsee Mullis 2015. See also the section on dance and technology, with\nincludes a number of entries on dance, film, and technology, in the\nforthcoming Bloomsbury Handbook to Dance and Philosophy edited by Rebecca\nFarinas and Julie Van Camp, with consultation by Craig Hanks and Aili Bresnahan.\n",
