    "main_text": "The Nature of Fiction || Fiction as Authorial Pretense\n1.3 Fiction as Authorial Pretense\n\n\nDeutsch\u2019s view is not the only one to highlight the central role\nof the author in the definition of fictionality. A number of authors\nthink that fiction-making involves a special kind of speech act on the\npart of the author, one that differs sharply from assertion (see\nespecially Currie 1990, to which we return below). Unlike\nDeutsch\u2019s account, such views have the capacity to classify\nworks like \u201cJimmy\u2019s World\u201d as non-fiction on the\ngrounds that authors assert the content of such works; even if much of\nthis content is made up, authors intend readers to take it as factual.\nJust how to characterize a special speech act of fiction-making or\nstory-telling is no easy matter, however. Take Nicholas\nWolterstorff\u2019s view that story-tellers engage in\n\u201cpresenting or offering for consideration\u201d propositions\nfor audiences to reflect on (Wolterstorff 1980). But even scientists\ndo this when putting forward speculative theories, so it is hard to\nsee how this sets fiction apart from non-fiction. John Searle has in\nfact argued that attempts to define a special illocutionary act of\nfiction-making are doomed to failure, since they entail that fictional\ndiscourse must differ in meaning from ordinary assertoric discourse\n(Searle 1975: 323\u20134; Predelli 2019 offers a sympathetic\nreconstruction of the argument). He proposes that we should instead\nunderstand fiction-making in terms of pretense: authors\npretend to assert what they are saying (1975: 324). More\ngenerally, \n\n\nthe author of a work of fiction pretends to perform a series of\nillocutionary acts, normally of the representative type [such as\nassertion], (1975: 325) \n\n\nbut without any attempt to deceive. For Searle, therefore, \n\n\nthe identifying criterion for whether or not a text is a work of\nfiction must of necessity lie in the illocutionary intentions of the\nauthor \n\n\n(that is, their presence in the case of non-fiction writing, their\nabsence in the case of fiction-making), and not in features of the\ntext (1975: 325). \n\n\nSearle\u2019s appeal to the notion of pretense has been very\ninfluential, but as stated the account seems inadequate in a number of\nways. As he himself admits, many works of fiction contain claims that\nseem to be put forward as serious assertions (he cites the opening\nlines of Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina, 1877), and so his\ntheory at best defines what makes a fragment of a work\nfictional, not what makes a work fictional (Searle 1975:\n331\u20132).\n(Searle\u2019s account shares this feature with a number of other\naccounts; we look at ways in which theorists have responded below.)\nFurthermore, not only is pretense not necessary for something to be\n(part of) a work of fiction, it is also not sufficient: one can\npretend to engage in an illocutionary act for all kinds of reasons\nother than the fact that one is writing fiction\u2014one might just\nbe engaging in mimicry or verbal irony, for example (Currie 1990: 17).\n\n\nDespite the latter problem, pretense has played, and continues to\nplay, a large role in the way philosophers understand fiction. Kripke,\nfor example, claimed as early as his 1973 John Locke Lectures that\nwriting fiction involved pretense, a view he then used to argue\nagainst attempts to use fiction in the defense of a descriptivist\ntheory of reference for names (Kripke 2013: 23). David Lewis too saw\nstory-telling as pretense: in his seminal work on truth in fiction he\nclaimed that \u201cthe story-teller [pretends] to be telling the\ntruth about matters whereof he has knowledge\u201d (Lewis 1978 [1983:\n266]). Neither\nclaimed to be defining fiction in terms of pretense, however.\nLewis, for example, acknowledges that sometimes one pretends in order\nto deceive, unlike the story-teller (Lewis 1987 [1983: 266]).\n",
