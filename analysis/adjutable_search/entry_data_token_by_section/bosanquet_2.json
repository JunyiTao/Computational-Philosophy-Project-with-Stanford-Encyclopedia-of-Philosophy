    "main_text": "Principal Contributions || Logic and Epistemology\n3.1 Logic and Epistemology\n\nBosanquet\u2019s earliest philosophical writing was in logic; his\ninterest in the area continued throughout his career, and it was\ninitially considered to be the area in which he made his most\nsignificant contributions to philosophy. \n\nThe first published statement of Bosanquet\u2019s views on logic\nappears in his 1883 essay, \u201cLogic as the Science of\nKnowledge.\u201d Here, one finds an explicit debt to Hegel and to\nLotze (whose System of Philosophy he was encouraged by T.H.\nGreen to translate and edit). Developed expositions of\nBosanquet\u2019s logic appear in his Knowledge and Reality: A\nCriticism of Mr F.H. Bradley\u2019s \u2018Principles of\nLogic\u2019 (1885) and in Logic, or the Morphology of\nKnowledge (1888). (The main themes of this latter work were\nrecast in a short volume, The Essentials of Logic [1895].)\nBosanquet produced a second edition of his Logic in 1911,\nadding a number of notes and three chapters dealing specifically with\npragmatist and realist criticisms of idealist coherence theory. During\nthe last decade of his life he engaged in a number of exchanges on\nquestions in logic, culminating in the publication of Implication\nand Linear Inference (1920), which C.D. Broad described as\ncontaining \u201cthe clearest and most plausible account\u201d of\nBosanquet\u2019s views (Broad 1920, p. 323). \n\nFor Bosanquet, logic is central to philosophy, but it is\n\u2018logic\u2019 in a broad sense. He writes: \n\n\nBy Logic we understand, with Plato and Hegel, the supreme law or\nnature of experience, the impulse towards unity and coherence\n[\u2026] by which every fragment yearns towards the whole to which\nit belongs\u2026 (Principle of Individuality and Value, p.\n340). \n\n\nThe \u201cinherent nature of reason,\u201d Bosanquet adds, is\n\u201cthe absolute demand for totality and consistency\u201d\n(Value and Destiny of the Individual, p. 9). Moreover,\nlogic\u2014 which Bosanquet calls \u201cthe spirit of\ntotality\u201d\u2014is \u201cthe clue to reality, value and\nfreedom\u201d (Principle of Individuality and Value, p. 23).\nNot surprisingly, then, Bosanquet argues that\nmetaphysics\u2014\u201cthe general science of\nreality\u201d\u2014cannot be distinguished from logic\u2014the\nscience of knowledge\u2014any more than one can separate a result\nfrom the process which produces it. \n\nDespite the connection between logic and knowledge, however, Bosanquet\ndenied that he was doing epistemology\u2014in the sense of a theory\nof cognition in which truth and reality are treated as independent of\none another. \n\nIn general, there are three key elements to Bosanquet\u2019s logic.\n\n\nFirst, logic is concerned with \n\n\nthe properties which are possessed by objects or ideas in so far as\nthey are members of the world of knowledge. (Essentials of\nLogic, p. 44) \n\n\nEverything that can be studied must be \u201casserted\u201d in\nconsciousness and, thus, is ultimately the concern of logic. \n\nSecond, Bosanquet writes that reality is \n\n\ncomposed of contents determined by systematic combination in a single\ncoherent structure. (Logic, p. 5) \n\n\nTo have a complete description of some thing, then, it must be\nunderstood in its context and in its relations to other things.\nSimilarly, to say that a judgement is \u2018true\u2019, we must take\nthe system in which the judgement is bound up and then note \n\n\nhow unintelligible that part of our world\u2026 would become if we\ndenied that judgement. (\u201cLogic as the Science of\nKnowledge\u201d, Works, vol. 1, p. 302) \n\n\nBosanquet\u2019s view is best described, then, as a coherence\ntheory\u2014though it is one that is concerned with more than the\nformal consistency of the set of true propositions. \n\nThird, according to Bosanquet, \n\n\nthe true meaning of propositions lies always ahead of fully conscious\nusage, as the real reality lies ahead of actual experience\n(Logic, 2nd ed., p. x). \n\n\nOur understanding of the world, then, is always incomplete.\nNevertheless, \n\n\nexperience forces thought along certain lines from partial to more\ncomplete notions. (\u201cLogic as the Science of Knowledge\u201d,\nWorks, vol. 1, p. 311) \n\n\nCoherence, therefore, is attained by a dialectical, evolutionary\nprocess. But this does not mean that humanity will some day arrive at\nultimate truth. \n\nBosanquet\u2019s logic has been the subject of significant\ndiscussion; the focus of this was, and still is, is the nature of\ninference and the theory of induction. \n\nIn Implication and Linear Inference, for example, Bosanquet\ndefends his long-standing view that inference is \u201cevery process\nby which knowledge extends itself\u201d (op. cit., p. 2). It\nis made possible by implication\u2014i.e., the property of each\nsystem whereby one can go from one part to all other parts. Standard\nformal logic (e.g., linear inference or syllogistic) is only a limited\nform of inference for, as Bosanquet reminded his readers, logical\nprinciples are not part of some abstract real but are the expression\nof the movement and life of the mind. \n\nBosanquet considered induction as importantly related to deduction; in\nthis respect, his views are similar to those of Christoph Sigwart and\nW.S. Jevons. To see specifically how induction and deduction are\nrelated, one must start with Bosanquet\u2019s distinction between the\nverification of a hypothesis and its establishment. In induction, a\nhypothesis is \u201cverified by the agreement of its deduced\nconclusion with observed facts\u201d; it is established only\n\u201cin proportion as we are convinced that the verified results\ncould not be deduced from any other principle\u201d (\u201cLogic as\nthe Science of Knowledge\u201d, Works, vol. 1, p. 329). But\nthen Bosanquet adds that \u201cevery verified result is pro tanto a\nconfirmation of any principles from which it is deducible\u201d\n(ibid.). Inference, then, is neither deductive (i.e., from\ngeneral principles) nor inductive (e.g., from instances or sense\ndata), but \u201csystematic\u201d\u2014it proceeds from within a\nwhole or a system. Thus, knowledge does not exist as a set of isolated\nformal propositions; all that we know is within a system. \n\nBosanquet\u2019s view of inference and of induction had significant\nconsequences, not only for the then-contemporary understanding of\nlogic\u2014by challenging the view that deductive inference is\n\u201cuseless\u201d (because those who know the premises already\nknow the content of the conclusion)\u2014but also for the\n\u2018new\u2019 logic of Frege, as developed by Russell and\nWhitehead, where judgement was separated from inference and\n\u2018linear implication\u2019 was the norm. It is perhaps for this\nreason that Bosanquet\u2019s arguments incited not only a\nwide-ranging critical response\u2014particularly from the\n\u2018neo-realists\u2019 at Cambridge and in the United\nStates\u2014but also the tantalizing remark by Wittgenstein to Moore\nin 1914 (cited in McGuinness 1988: 199\u2013200) that some of\nWittgenstein\u2019s (unsuccessful) Cambridge B.A. dissertation was\n\u201ccribbed\u201d from Bosanquet\u2019s logic.\n\nAlthough Bosanquet\u2019s logic follows, in many respects, that of\nHegel, it arguably avoids Bertrand Russell\u2019s criticism of\nHegel\u2019s logic\u2014i.e., that it unconsciously assumes and\nincorporates the faults of traditional logic. Indeed,\nBosanquet\u2019s defense of elements of classical deductive logic\nagainst J.S. Mill\u2019s criticisms \u201cmade philosophy safe for\nlogic\u201d and was, in large part, responsible for\n\u201crehabilitating\u201d logic in British philosophy, particularly\nafter the critiques of Locke and his successors (see Allard 2007). It\nhas also been argued (by Fred Wilson 2007) that Bosanquet\u2019s\nviews on logic and scientific method are close to those of some\ncontemporary critics of empirical accounts of natural laws, such as\nFred Dretske and David Armstrong.\n",
