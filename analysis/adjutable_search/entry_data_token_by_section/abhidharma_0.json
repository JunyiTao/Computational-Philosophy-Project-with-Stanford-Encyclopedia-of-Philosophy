Abhidharma: its origins and texts\n\nThe early history of Buddhism in India is remarkably little known and\nthe attempt to construct a consistent chronology of that history still\nengrosses the minds of contemporary scholars. A generally accepted\ntradition has it that some time around the beginning of the third\ncentury BCE, the primitive Buddhist community divided into two parties\nor fraternities: the Sthaviras (Pali, Theriyas) and the\nMah\u0101s\u0101\u1e45ghikas, each of which thenceforth had its own\nordination traditions. Throughout the subsequent two centuries or so,\ndoctrinal disputes arose between these two parties, resulting in the\nformation of various schools of thought (v\u0101da;\n\u0101cariyav\u0101da) and teacher lineages\n(\u0101cariyakula) (Vin 51\u201354; Mhv V\n12\u201313. See Cousins 1991, 27\u201328; Frauwallner 1956, 5ff\n& 130ff; Lamotte 1988, 271ff; Wynne 2019, 269\u2013283).\n\nAccording to traditional Buddhist accounts, by the time the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na doctrines arose, roughly in the first century BCE,\nthere were eighteen sub-sects or schools of Sthaviras, the tradition\nancestral to the Therav\u0101da (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine of\nthe elders\u201d). The number eighteen, though, became conventional\nin Buddhist historiography for symbolic and mnemonic reasons\n(Obeyesekere 1991) and, in fact, different Buddhist sources preserve\ndivergent lists of schools which sum up to more than eighteen. The\nlikelihood is that the early formative period of the Buddhist\ncommunity gave rise to multiple intellectual branches that developed\nspontaneously due to the geographical extension of the community over\nthe entire Indian subcontinent and subject to the particular problems\nthat confronted each monastic community (sa\u1e45gha). Each\nsa\u1e45gha tended to specialize in a specific branch of\nlearning, had its own practical customs and relations with lay\ncircles, and was influenced by the particular territories, economy,\nand use of language and dialect prevalent in its environment. Indeed,\nthe names of the \u201ceighteen schools\u201d are indicative of\ntheir origins in characteristic doctrines, geographical locations, or\nthe legacy of particular founders: for instance,\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da (\u201cadvocates of the doctrine that all\nthings exist\u201d), Sautr\u0101ntikas (\u201cthose who rely on the\ns\u016btras\u201d)/D\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ntikas\n(\u201cthose who employ\n examples\u201d),[1]\n and Pudgalav\u0101da (\u201cthose who affirm the existence of the\nperson\u201d); Haimavatas (\u201cthose of the snowy\nmountains\u201d); or V\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012byas (\u201cthose\naffiliated with V\u0101ts\u012bputra\u201d) respectively. As noted by\nGethin (1998, 52), rather than sects or denominations as in\nChristianity, \u201cat least some of the schools mentioned by later\nBuddhist tradition are likely to have been informal schools of thought\nin the manner of \u2018Cartesians,\u2019 \u2018British\nEmpiricists,\u2019 or \u2018Kantians\u2019 for the history of\nmodern\n philosophy.\u201d[2]\n\nIt is customarily assumed that the multiple ancient Buddhist schools\ntransmitted their own versions of Abhidharma collections, but only two\ncomplete canonical collections are preserved, representing two\nschools: the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, who emerged as an independent\nschool from within the Sthaviras around the second or first century\nBCE, became dominant in north, especially northwest India, and spread\nto central Asia; and the Sinhalese Therav\u0101da, a branch of the\nSthaviras that spread out in south India and parts of southeast Asia.\nThese two extant collections comprise the third of the \u201cthree\nbaskets\u201d (Skt., tripi\u1e6daka, Pali,\ntipi\u1e6daka) of the Buddhist canon. The exegetical\ntraditions of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and Therav\u0101da understand\ntheir respective canonical Abhidharma to consist of a set of seven\ntexts, though each school specifies a different set of texts. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101din Abhidharma-pi\u1e6daka consists of\nthe Sa\u1e45g\u012btipary\u0101ya (Discourse on the\nCollective Recitation), the Dharmaskandha\n(Compendium of Dharmas), the\nPraj\u00f1apti\u015b\u0101stra (Manual of\nConcepts), the Vij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101ya\n(Compendium of Consciousness), the\nDh\u0101tuk\u0101ya (Compendium of Elements), the\nPrakara\u1e47ap\u0101da (Literary\nExposition), and the J\u00f1\u0101naprasth\u0101na\n(The Foundation of Knowledge). These seven texts survive in\nfull only in their ancient Chinese translations. The Therav\u0101din\nAbhidhamma-pi\u1e6daka comprises the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i (Enumeration of\nDhammas), the Vibha\u1e45ga (Analysis),\nthe Dh\u0101tukath\u0101 (Discourse on Elements),\nthe Puggalapa\u00f1\u00f1atti (Designation of\nPersons), the Kath\u0101vatthu (Points of\nDiscussion), the Yamaka (Pairs), and the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na (Causal Conditions). These\nseven texts are preserved in Pali and all but the Yamaka have\nbeen translated into English.\n\nLater generations composed commentaries on the canonical Abhidharma\nand introduced a variety of exegetical manuals that expound the\nessentials of the canonical systems. These post-canonical texts are\nthe products of single authors and display fully developed polemical\nstances and sectarian worldviews of their respective schools. Much of\nthe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma system is contained in\nBuddhaghosa\u2019s comprehensive Visuddhimagga (The Path\nof Purification, fifth century CE). More direct introductory\nAbhidhamma manuals are Buddhadatta\u2019s\nAbhidhamm\u0101vat\u0101ra (Introduction to\nAbhidhamma, fifth century CE) and Anuruddha\u2019s\nAbhidhammatthasa\u1e45gaha (Compendium of the Topics of\nAbhidhamma, twelfth century CE). The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\ntradition preserves in Chinese translation three different recensions\nof an authoritative Abhidharma commentary or\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 dated to the first or second century\nCE, the last and best known of which is called the\nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101. The\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia document several centuries\nof scholarly activity representing multiple Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nbranches, most notably the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins of Kashmir who are\nknown as Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika. The\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da manual most influential for later Chinese and\nTibetan Buddhism, however, is Vasubandhu\u2019s\nAbhidharmako\u015ba (Treasury of Abhidharma, fifth\ncentury CE). The Abhidharmako\u015ba\u2019s auto-commentary\ncontains substantial criticism of orthodox Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\npositions, which later Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\nmasters attempted to refute. Particularly famous in this category is\nthe Ny\u0101y\u0101nus\u0101ra (Conformance to Correct\nPrinciple) of Sa\u1e45ghabhadra, a contemporary of Vasubandhu.\nThis comprehensive treatise reestablishes orthodox\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da views and is considered one of the final\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da works to have\n survived.[3]\n\nIn sum, the Abhidharma/Abhidhamma texts are by and large compositions\ncontemporary with the formative period in the history of the early\nBuddhist schools, providing the means by which one group could define\nitself and defend its position against the divergent interpretations\nand criticisms of other parties. Although much of the Abhidharma\nmindset and something of its method draw on the\n\u0100gamas/Nik\u0101yas, i.e., the collections of\ns\u016btras (Pali, suttas), the main body of its\nliterature contains interpretations of the Buddha\u2019s discourses\nspecific to each school of thought and philosophical elaborations of\nselectively emphasized doctrinal issues. These continued to be refined\nby subsequent generations of monks who contributed to the\nconsolidation of the two surviving Therav\u0101da and\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da schools.\n",
