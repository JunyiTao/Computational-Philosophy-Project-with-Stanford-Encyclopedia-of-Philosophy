    "main_text": "Virtue\n5. Virtue\n\nIn the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, Confucians were interested in\nthe nature and psychological structure of virtues, particularly the\nvirtues concerned with fostering and upholding good human\nrelationships. They saw their emphasis on the virtues of human\nrelationships as distinguishing them from Daoists and Buddhists,\ninsofar as the latter two groups tended to promote a concern with\npersonal salvation (which struck some Confucians as slighting moral\nvirtue) and with non-attachment (which many saw as incompatible with\nhaving meaningful human relationships).\n\nThere is a relatively strong consensus in this period that five\nvirtues are most important, both in terms of the scope of human\nactivity that they should regulate and in terms of their contribution\nto the virtuous person\u2019s moral quality. The \u201cFive Constant\nVirtues\u201d or \u201cFive Constants\u201d (Wuchang\n\u4e94\u5e38) were humaneness (ren \u4ec1, sometimes\ntranslated as \u201cbenevolence\u201d or \u201cGoodness\u201d),\nrighteousness (yi \u7fa9), ritual propriety (li\n\u79ae, sometimes simply \u201cpropriety\u201d), wisdom\n(zhi \u667a), and faithfulness (xin \u4fe1). The\nConfucians of this period often called attention to ways in which\nthese particular virtues overlap, such that a person could not\ninstantiate one without instantiating another (Angle & Tiwald\n2017: 164\u2013165). But they still tended to think of four of those\nvirtues as having certain paradigmatic domains or situations where\nthey were most manifest. Paradigm cases of humaneness are those in\nwhich one acts out of love or care to promote the interests of others,\nas when one helps or looks after a family member. Many Daoxue\nConfucians also describe this virtue movingly as one of \u201cforming\none body\u201d with other people or with the cosmos more generally,\nwhich in turn requires that we see ourselves as extensions of others\nand vice-versa (Ivanhoe 2018: 58\u201373; Tiwald & Van Norden\n2014: 140\u2013141). Paradigm cases of righteousness are those in\nwhich someone refuses to violate prohibitions that would rightly be\nregarded as degrading or shameful, as when refusing an otherwise\ntempting bribe. Sometimes righteousness just has to do with ensuring a\njust distribution of goods according to merit or position. Clear cases\nof ritual propriety are those in which one performs a ritual with\nreverence. The Chinese character for \u201critual\u201d (li\n\u79ae), however, is of much broader scope than its English\nequivalent, covering nearly every social protocol which should be\nperformed with a sense of respect, from weddings and funerals to\ngreetings (e.g., bowing) and serving food and drink. Paradigm cases of\nwisdom include such things as understanding the other virtues (their\ncharacteristic motives and feelings), correctly assessing the quality\nof a person\u2019s character (when choosing someone for an important\npost, for example), and knowing the best means by which to achieve\nvirtuous ends. The fifth virtue, faithfulness, is best understood as\nthe virtue of being committed to and guided by reality in a consistent\nand reliable way. Some Confucians were careful to say that the virtue\nin this fundamental sense does not have its own paradigmatic domain of\nactivity\u2014it regulates and supports all of the virtues, insofar\nthey all require us to being attentive to what\u2019s real and\navoiding self-serving illusions that would otherwise get us off the\nhook (BXZY 47\u201382; Angle & Tiwald 2017:\n160\u2013163; Fuji 2011: 28\u201331).\n\nA potential source of confusion arises from the fact that humaneness\nis sometimes used in a more fundamental and all-encompassing sense,\nwhere it refers not to the virtue of loving or caring about the\nwelfare of others, but to the virtue of harmonizing with or fitting\ninto a larger system of mutual life-generativity, understood as\ncorrectly participating in a system in which each person\u2019s life\ncontributes appropriately to the life of others (BXZY 70;\nAngle & Tiwald 2017: 162\u2013163). Humaneness in this more\nfundamental sense does not necessarily need to be motivated by love or\ncare\u2014one can exhibit the virtue of harmonizing with the larger\nwhole even while acting out of a sense of shame (as righteousness\nrequires), or reverence (as ritual propriety requires). But there is a\nsense in which we exhibit the virtue of mutual life-generativity even\nwhen acting righteously or ritually proper. On an interpretation\nsuggested by Zhu Xi, this is because all of the other virtues can be\nseen as getting their purpose and value from their part in\ncontributing to mutual life-generativity, much as the life-production\nof the springtime gives purpose and value to the summer, autumn, and\nwinter (ZZYL 20:694; Angle & Tiwald 2017:\n166\u2013167).\n",
