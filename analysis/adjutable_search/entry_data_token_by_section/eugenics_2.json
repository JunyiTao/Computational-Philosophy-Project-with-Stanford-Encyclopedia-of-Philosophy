    "main_text": "Arguing for \u201cliberal\u201d eugenics || Using reprogenetic technologies\n2.2 Using reprogenetic technologies\n\n\nMany theorists argue in favor of permitting\nparents to make choices about their future children\u2019s genetic make-up.\nSuch arguments run the gamut from a completely laissez-faire market\nsystem \u2013 or \u201cgenetic supermarket\u201d \u2013 of the sort\nconsidered by Robert Nozick (1974: 315) to a more highly regulated\nsystem, with controls to protect the well-being of future children as\nwell as socially valued goods (e.g., rough equality, efforts to\neliminate discrimination) that might be put at risk in a completely\nfree market environment (Buchanan et al 2000). Many also contend that\nthere is a morally relevant difference between choices aimed at\naddressing diseases and those aimed at selecting or enhancing\nnon-disease traits such as intelligence, self-confidence, height, eye\ncolor, or attractiveness. Further, while some liberal eugenics\nadvocates contend that reproductive interventions for non-disease\ntraits are permissible (Agar 2004, Green 2006), some argue that they\nare morally obligatory (Harris 2007; Savulescu 2005; Savulescu and\nKahane 2009).\n2.2.1 Addressing diseases\n\n\nLiberal eugenics arguments often start by\nrecognizing the value of treatment of disease. Disease, typically\ndefined as a negative departure from species typical functioning\n(Boorse 1975; Daniels 1994), can interfere with an individual\u2019s\nparticipation in society and/or individual flourishing. Buchanan et al.\n(2000) link disease to a reduction of opportunity, and so argue that\nprovision of medical treatment for disease is a way for the state to\npromote equality of opportunity. Parents are obliged to ensure that\ntheir children get medical treatment for diseases and can be charged\nwith negligence if they fail to do so. This obligation does not obtain\nin cases of diseases that result in relatively small negative effects\non participation (e.g., mild asthma) or where the potential benefits of\ntreatment are still somewhat uncertain or might be outweighed by the\npossible harms (e.g., some cancer treatments). Parents whose\nconceptions of the good life do not include medical treatment for\nserious diseases \u2013 as in some religious communities \u2013 are not\nallowed to impose this view on their children because the children\ndeserve the opportunity to choose to adopt those views or not when they\nare adults. Mandatory life-saving treatment of their childhood diseases\nhelps to ensure that they survive to make such decisions as adults\n(Feinberg 1980). This requirement has been the subject of some debate\n(see, e.g., DesAutels, Battin and May 1999).\n\n\nBuchanan et al. (2000) note that as technology\nadvances, theories of justice need no longer consider \u201cnatural\ninequalities\u201d to be given, or outside the scope of distribution.\nIf equality of opportunity is one of the aims of a society, then,\nprovision of certain forms of genetic intervention \u2013 including\ninterventions that determine who will be brought into\nexistence \u2013 may become owed to future people as\na matter of justice. If parents can decide between implanting an embryo\nthat carries a genetic marker associated with a serious disease \u2013 \ne.g., Tay Sachs \u2013 or an embryo without that marker, they would have\na moral obligation to choose the latter, in the name of promoting the\nhealth and well-being of the future child (impersonally, perhaps, given\nthe non-identity problem).\n\n\nLiberal eugenics advocates thus move from a\ncommonly accepted position regarding the obligation to treat serious\ndiseases in children, to a requirement for people to use genetic\ninterventions in reproduction (e.g., pre-implantation genetic testing\nor genome editing) as a way to avoid transmitting serious diseases to\none\u2019s offspring (Savulescu 2001; Agar 2004; Glover 2006; Green\n2007; Harris 2007; Savulescu and Kahane 2009).\n\n\nTo be clear, though, most liberal eugenics\nproponents do not suggest that all prospective parents would be obliged\nto seek reproductive counseling and use IVF in order to fulfill\ntheir parenting or impersonal duties (but see Savulescu and Kahane\n2009). Such a requirement would present serious ethical concerns. Given\nthe prohibitive costs and relatively low success rates of IVF\ntreatment, this kind of obligation would be overly demanding on\nprospective parents, and particularly on women. Arguably, it would also\nconstitute an infringement on people\u2019s procreative liberty.\n\n\nSimilarly, proponents contend that the obligation\nto use reprogenetics to avoid transmitting diseases to one\u2019s\noffspring does not extend to legal mandates on prenatal testing or\nabortion (or one day, genome editing). For them, such practices would\nbe consistent with the old eugenics but not with the new, liberal\nversion which values reproductive liberty (but see below for challenges\nto whether such view can be maintained consistently by at least some\nproponents of liberal eugenics).\n2.2.2 Addressing non-disease traits\n\n\n Liberal eugenics advocates recognize that\nmany prospective parents may be interested not only in addressing\nhealth-related problems in their offspring but also in selecting or\nediting non-disease related genes to improve their children\u2019s\nwellbeing. Why settle for the likelihood of normal functioning if one\ncould safely choose other traits that are likely to make a\nchild\u2019s life better?\n\n\nTwo reasons are given for the use of reprogenetic\ntechnologies in this way. First, according to some liberal eugenics\nproponents, non-disease traits such as intelligence, memory, sex, hair\nor skin color, height, or beauty affect people\u2019s wellbeing\n(Savulescu 2001; Harris 2005; Green 2007). Sometimes their effect on\nwellbeing is at least as significant as that of some diseases.  If\nso then, using reprogenetic technologies to select or edit some of\nthose traits would be morally permissible.\n\n\nSecond, as mentioned earlier, liberal eugenics\nadvocates place significant value in reproductive freedom, and they\ncontend that reprogenetic technologies can advance people\u2019s\nreproductive choices in meaningful ways (Roberston 1994; Buchanan et\nal. 2000; Savulescu 2001; Agar 2004; Harris 2007; Green 2007; Buchanan\n2011). If selecting or enhancing non-disease traits contributes to\npeople\u2019s reproductive projects, then provided that their actions\ndo not clearly and seriously harm others, they should be able to use\nreprogenetic technologies with such aims.\n\n\nLiberal eugenics proponents recognize that the\npermissibility to use reprogenetic technologies for non-disease traits\nraises significant moral concerns. For instance, obsessively focused\nprospective parents might design their children in ways that are\noverbearing or narrowly focused on a particular goal of the parents\n(Kass 2003; Sandel 2007). To avoid this problem, liberal eugenics\nadvocates propose various limits on genetic interventions for\nnon-disease traits. There is widespread agreement that interventions\nshould not harm the future child (by creating a life so miserable as to\nbe not worth living, as might be the subject of a wrongful life suit).\nBeyond that, variations include, for instance: (1) only interventions\non traits that will benefit the future children no matter what life\nplan they decide to pursue and that do not reinforce problematic social\nnorms (Agar 2004), (2) only interventions that preserve a child\u2019s right\nto an open future (Davis 2010), or (3) only interventions that preserve\nopen futures and protect some central core of our human nature (Glover\n2006), or (4) only interventions that rational people agree can be\nunderstood to be in the best interest of the child (Green 2007).\n\n\nHow might one harm a child through choosing\ngenetic traits? Perhaps by selecting for traits that clearly cause\nsignificant suffering and a typically short life span (e.g., Tay-Sachs\ndisease, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). Such constraints may seem unnecessary,\ngiven that most parents do not intentionally desire painful states for\ntheir children and would not seek to engineer them in this way. Also,\nrelatively few genetic conditions will be so inherently debilitating as\nto make life so obviously miserable that would prevent one to consider\nthat life is, on balance, a benefit.\n\n\nSome of the other constraints are more contentious\nbecause they involve decisions about lives that would be worth living\nbut have different features. For instance, it can be difficult to\ndetermine how one might ensure a child\u2019s capacity to choose from a\nvariety of life plans, or what traits would be necessary to protect a\nchild\u2019s right to an open future.\n\n\nDavis (2010) and Agar (2004) both use deafness as\na case for clarification, as such a case calls attention to the\ncontentious nature of these decisions. They both take hearing to be a\ncore human capacity, or a trait that is necessary for a wide variety of\nlife plans. Hence, they argue, engineering a child to be deaf will\nlimit that child\u2019s future options. This is not, of course, to say that\ndeaf individuals cannot live rewarding lives in which they flourish.\nIndeed, Agar recognizes that in some circumstances, lacking a capacity\nlike hearing will only lead to a small difference in relative freedom,\nand if so, then we might not have a \u201cgeneral requirement to\nreplace genetic arrangements linked with deafness\u201d (2004: 105).\nOn his view, prospective parents could engineer a child to be hearing\nbecause it would increase her real freedom but could not engineer a\nchild to be deaf. Weighing in on the now widely analyzed case of two\nDeaf women (the capital \u201cD\u201d marks membership in the\nlinguistic-cultural group of the Deaf; a small \u201cd\u201d only\nsignifies the physical state of the body) who sought out a deaf sperm\ndonor in hopes of having a deaf child (Spriggs 2002; Mundy 2002), Agar\nargues that they reduced their child\u2019s real freedom by attempting to\nensure that the child would be deaf. (Although this case did not\ninvolve reprogenetic technologies, one can easily imagine the use of\nsuch technologies to ensure the birth of a child who would be deaf.)\nDavis, too, acknowledges the claims of Deaf culture, and the reasons\nparents might prefer to have a child more like themselves, but argues\nthat deliberately trying to conceive a child who will have relatively\nlimited options \u2013 limited, in her view, not just due to enduring\ndiscrimination and social constraints, but also to bodily\ndeficits \u2013 is morally impermissible.\n\n\nConstraints on parental reproductive decisions\nabout what traits to choose can also be seen as conflicting with\nreproductive freedom and parental autonomy. For instance, Green\n(2007) rejects the \u201cright to an open future\u201d language in\npart because he thinks parents must be allowed to do things that are\nmore for their own interests than for the sake of their children, even\nwhen doing so affects how the children develop. Following William\nRuddick (2007), he thinks of parents as both guardians and\ngardeners \u2013 protecting their children so that they can grow as they\nwill, but also shaping how they grow in line with\nthe parents\u2019 hopes. Because he thinks \u201cparental love almost\nalways prevails\u201d (Green, 2007: 114) \u2013 when we are faced with\nan actual child of ours, we will (typically) love the child, regardless\nof the child\u2019s traits \u2013 he finds it morally acceptable that\nparents might want to choose traits for their children that do not\nstrictly speaking preserve an open future. If parents want a child with\na good shot at an athletic career, for instance, why not allow them to\nengineer for athleticism or great vision? Doing\nso might narrow other life opportunities, but not to\nthe extent that the child couldn\u2019t choose how her life goes. Her future\nwould still be open enough. Green emphasizes parental reproductive\nautonomy, and the continuum between shaping the future possibilities\nfor our existing children through parental values, education, religion,\nand more, and doing so through genetic interventions. His central\nrecommendation is that genetic interventions should be aimed at what\nis reasonably in the child\u2019s best interests (2007:\n216), recognizing that the parents\u2019 own interests are also relevant. By\n\u201creasonably\u201d he means that it is not enough for parents\nto think that something is in their child\u2019s best\ninterests; their judgment must accord with that of most other informed\nmembers of society (2007: 216). Once that condition is satisfied,\nparents would be permitted to choose, according to their own tastes and\npreferences, within a wide range of options of relatively\n\u201call-purpose\u201d traits (2007: 218). Just who the\n\u201cinformed\u201d members of society are, is of course, a matter\nof some contention (for discussion, see Hayry 2010).\n\n\nIn sum, theorists who argue for the permissibility\nof using reprogenetic technologies and practices for disease and\nnon-disease traits seek to preserve parental reproductive autonomy and\nto expand rather than reduce parental options. At the same time, they\nemphasize the need to increase the future child\u2019s options, so long as\ndoing so does not reinforce unjust social prejudices or threaten deeply\nheld core values. One problem with this thesis, to be explored more in\ndepth below in the section on critiques, is the appropriate scope of\nits central claims. Some critics (e.g., Asch 2000; Saxton 2000; Sparrow\n2005), for instance, suggest that it fails to recognize that many of\nthe presumptions about social prejudice could be extended to prejudice\nagainst people with certain diseases and disabilities, many of whom\nlive relatively well with traits or characteristics that genetic\nenhancers may well desire to eliminate or attempt to improve upon. If\nwe ought not collude with and exacerbate the social prejudices of\nsexism and racism through our reproductive genetic choices, why is\ndoing the same for ableist norms permissible?\n2.2.3 Morally permissible or obligatory?\n\n\nBut are parental choices regarding non-disease\ntraits simply morally permissible or are they morally obligatory? While\nadvocates of liberal eugenics agree on the obligation to address\ndisease-related genomic variants, they disagree regarding whether the\nuse of reprogenetic technologies for non-disease traits is a matter of\nmoral permissibility or obligation. For some proponents, it is morally\npermissible, but not obligatory, for parents to use (with some\nconstraints) reprogenetic technologies to select or edit non-disease\ntraits (Agar 2004; Green 2007). They reject the moral obligatoriness of\nthese practices for several reasons. First, there is the difficulty of\ndetermining just what counts as an improvement (beyond addressing\nserious disease). For instance, Agar (2004) questions whether it is\nobviously better for a child to be highly intelligent (roughly\napproximated by a likely IQ of 160). Might some parents reasonably\nchoose a more moderate level of intelligence for a child, presuming the\nchild will have greater social opportunities in the latter case?\nPerhaps the overall freedom of the child of moderate intelligence will\nbe greater than that of the child with high intelligence, even though\non that one dimension the child\u2019s capacities are comparatively\nlower. Second, while one might consider it reasonable to incur risks of\nreprogenetic intervention to treat or prevent diseases, it is by no\nmeans clear that the risk-benefit balance would be appropriate when\ndealing with non-medical traits.  Third, many recognize the\nimportance and value of diversity (Green 2007). Given the many ways in\nwhich parents can attempt to improve the lives of their children, it is\nnot clear why there would be a moral obligation to choose some\nnon-disease traits over others rather than simply allowing parents to\nchoose what they wish. Additionally, even if many people agree on the\nvalue of some non-disease characteristic and it becomes so common that\nits possession is practically required for equal participation in\nsociety, we might want to resist the temptation to make that\nintervention obligatory. For example, Agar (2004: 85)\nsuggests this might happen with the trait \u201cbeing somewhat happier\nthan is now normal\u201d if treatment tied to 5-HTTLPR, a genetic\nmarker associated with upbeat temperament, became common. The\nnow-typical temperament is not a disease, but a mere variety within the\ncapacious normal range of functioning and would likely remain so even\nin a future society of 5-HTTLPR-enhanced people.\nA liberal eugenics cannot mandate any one view of\nthe good life for its citizens.\n\n\nOther proponents (Harris, 2002, 2007; Savulescu\n2005; Savulescu and Kahane 2009) recognize the potential benefits of\ngenetic enhancement, and forthrightly argue in favor of moral\nobligations to pursue them. Some such enhancements might be relatively\nminor, while others might be radical enough to eventually create a new\nspecies (Glover 2006).\n\n\nEarly work by Savulescu (2001), for instance,\nargues that parents have an obligation to produce the best children\npossible. This obligation cannot be owed to any particular child (given\nthe non-identity problem), but is an impersonal obligation, to make the\nworld a better place. If parents are using pre-implantation genetic\ndiagnosis, they should always choose the embryo with the best chances\nat the best life. Non-disease traits, as mentioned earlier, can have\nsignificant effects on how well people\u2019s lives go. Savulescu\nimagines that the rational parent could make no other decision but to\navoid the negative linkages and promote the positive ones, where\npossible.\n\n\nBut this obligation is a moral one. Thus, the\nstate need not (indeed, should not) legally coerce parents to select or\nedit their offspring to produce the best children they can have\n(Savulescu 2001). To the contrary, the state must balance the benefits\nof potential enforcement against its existing obligations to protect\nreproductive liberties. Nonetheless, the state might have good reason\nto encourage parents to take such action, through education and\npersuasive public health campaigns (not unlike anti-smoking campaigns).\nOn this stronger view, others, too, would be right to express\ndisapproval (Savulescu and Kahane 2009)\n\n\nA similar position is advocated by Harris (2007).\nAlthough the arguments are about a moral obligation, these liberal\neugenics advocates recognize that other competing priorities (e.g.,\nautonomy of parents, welfare of other siblings, harm to others) could\npotentially trump this obligation.\n\n\nFor other liberal eugenics advocates the moral\nobligation to select or edit non-disease traits is grounded on social\nbenefits. For instance, Buchanan (2011) is broadly optimistic\nabout biomedical enhancement technologies \u2013 seeing them as not\nsignificantly unlike other enhancing societal innovations, such as\nliteracy, numeracy and agriculture \u2013  and argues in favor of\nfunding research and development into a broad array of enhancements.\nDoing so will be socially good: good for economic growth to avoid\nproblems of illiteracy, sickness, etc. that can accompany, for\ninstance, lower intelligence and merely typical immune systems.\n\n\nOther theorists likewise offer social benefit\njustifications for genetic enhancement. Elster (2011) advocates a\nprinciple of general procreative beneficence, changing the last part of\nSavulescu\u2019s PPB to an obligation to produce the best child, of those\npossible, \u201cwhose life will maximize the expected overall value in\nthe world.\u201d (2011: 483). Rather than focus on individual welfare,\nhe recommends a system of obligations that starts from general social\ngoods. Parents considering reproduction are then bound by a maximizing\nduty to the world.\n\n\nAlthough Savulescu highlights the well-being of\nthe individual in his work on procreative beneficence, in more recent\nwork, the obligation to produce the best seems to have shifted from an\nobligation to improve the world by privately producing the best\nindividuals, to an obligation to improve the world by producing\nindividuals who will help to solve social problems. For instance, in\ntheir book Unfit for the Future (2012), Persson and Savulescu\nargue that we are obligated to fund and explore moral\nbioenhancement (2012: 2) \u2013 the idea that we could\ngenetically or pharmacologically enhance our moral motivation, to\nreduce selfishness and aggression, and increase our sense of fairness,\naltruism, and our willingness to cooperate (see also Douglas 2008).\nGiven the massive threats to human well-being presented by global\nclimate change and the abundance of weapons of mass\ndestruction \u2013 and the fact that solutions to these large-scale\nproblems will require collective action to prevent future\nproblems \u2013 Persson and Savulescu claim that traditional methods of\nmoral change (e.g., education, public campaigns) are unlikely to be\neffective. If we care about the planet \u2013 and we should \u2013 then\nwe are obligated to invest in moral bioenhancement research, and\npresumably ensure that if successful, it gets wide uptake (Persson and\nSavulescu 2012). Buchanan (2011) is sympathetic, noting that critics\nwho worry about whether we will use this technology wisely may be\nshort-sighted.\n\n\nThis suggestion\nabout moral bioenhancement has sparked criticism\nfocused on threats to human freedom (Harris 2011; Simkulet 2013), the\nmeaning of being virtuous (Kabasenche 2013; Levin 2021), the complexity\nof human moral psychology (Zarpentine 2011), and the complexities of\nhuman biology (Wiseman 2016, Levin 2021).\n",
