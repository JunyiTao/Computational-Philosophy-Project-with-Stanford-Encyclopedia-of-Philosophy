    "main_text": "The Debate After Davidson || Changing the Subject\n3.4 Recent Developments\n3.4.1 Epistemic Akrasia\n\nOne focus of renewed attention in recent years has been (so-called)\nepistemic akrasia. An epistemically akratic agent holds beliefs of the\nform \u201cP, but my evidence doesn\u2019t support P.\u201d In an\ninfluential discussion, Sophie Horowitz posits an analogy between\nepistemic akrasia and practical akrasia: \u201cJust as an akratic\nagent acts in a way she believes she ought not act, an epistemically\nakratic agent believes something that she believes is unsupported by\nher evidence\u201d (Horowitz 2014, p. 718).\n\nIs epistemic akrasia possible? Some philosophers who are happy to\ncountenance practical akrasia have answered in the negative with\nrespect to its putative doxastic analogue (these include Hurley 1989,\nAdler 2002, and Owens 2002). One argument for this denial focuses on\nthe notion of doxastic control. David Owens argues that we lack the\nrequisite sort of doxastic control required for our beliefs to be\nformed freely and deliberately, \u201ceither in accordance with our\njudgement about what we should believe or against those\njudgements\u201d (Owens 2002, p. 395). But such control, Owens\nargues, would be necessary in order for epistemic akrasia to be\npossible.\n\nA second argument for the impossibility of epistemic akrasia\n(discussed in Adler 2002) turns on what is seen as an important\ndisanalogy between epistemic and practical reasoning. Conflict between\ntwo incompatible beliefs weakens one or both beliefs (since both\ncan\u2019t be true), whereas conflict between two desires that\ncan\u2019t both be satisfied need not weaken either desire. A\npractically akratic agent who has formed an all things considered\njudgment about what to do may thus still be in the grip of a desire to\ndo something else. But this, Adler says, has no analogue in the\nepistemic realm: one can\u2019t remain in the grip of a belief if one\nviews the evidence for an opposing belief as decisive. Thus, practical\nakrasia is \u201cmotivationally intelligible\u201d in a way that\nepistemic akrasia is not (Adler 2002, p. 8). Neil Levy responds to\nthis concern by arguing that while beliefs in some domains fit this\nmodel, the disanalogy Adler points to does not hold in domains where\nthere is room for \u201congoing, rational controversy,\u201d\nincluding philosophy (Levy 2004, p. 156). One may form a belief in\nfavor of a philosophical view while nonetheless feeling the pull of\nincompatible views, just as one may retain a desire that one judges\nall things considered one shouldn\u2019t satisfy. Though Levy only\nclaims that Adler\u2019s impossibility argument fails, Ribeiro (2011)\nuses similar considerations to motivate the claim that epistemic\nakrasia is not only possible, but actual.\n\nSome philosophers who think there could be an epistemic version of\nakrasia have raised questions about how closely it would parallel\npractical akrasia. Daniel Greco (2014), for instance, argues that\nwhile a divergence between one\u2019s moral emotions and one\u2019s\nurges might play an important role in understanding some cases of\npractical akrasia, there are no corresponding epistemic emotions that\nwould help to illuminate epistemic akrasia (Greco 2014,\np. 207). Practical and epistemic varieties of akrasia nonetheless have\nin common that they involve a kind of fragmentation or inner conflict;\nGreco uses this characterization to support the idea that both\nepistemic and practical akrasia are always irrational. (Feldman 2005\nalso sees epistemic akrasia as a paradigm of irrationality.)\n\nJust as the rational status of practical akrasia has become contested\n(see section 3.2 above), however, some theorists have now argued that\nepistemic akrasia could in fact be rational. For example, Coates\n(2012), Weatherson (2019), Wedgwood (2011), and Lasonen-Aarnio (2014)\nhave argued for the rational permissibility of some beliefs of the\ncharacteristic akratic form \u201cP, but my evidence doesn\u2019t\nsupport P.\u201d This discussion has been shaped by a growing\ninterest in higher-order evidence\u2014that is, evidence about what\none\u2019s evidence supports. The notion of higher-order evidence\ncomplicates the picture of belief at work in arguments like\nAdler\u2019s (2002) above. Defenders of the rationality of epistemic\nakrasia have argued that beliefs of the form \u201cP, but my evidence\ndoesn\u2019t support P\u201d can be rationally permissible when one\nhas misleading higher-order evidence. In such cases, they contend, a\nperson could have good grounds both for believing that P and for\nbelieving that her evidence doesn\u2019t support the conclusion that\nP.\n\nFor instance, Horowitz describes a case of epistemic akrasia involving\na detective, Sam, who stays up all night trying to identify a\nthief. He knows the evidence he is working with is good, and concludes\non the basis of this evidence that the thief was Lucy. He calls his\npartner and tells her that he\u2019s cracked the case, only to have\nher remind him that his reasoning while sleepy is often poor. Sam\nhadn\u2019t thought about his previous track record, but he believes\nhis partner that he\u2019s often wrong about what his evidence\nsupports when he\u2019s tired. (Horowitz 2014, p. 719).\n\nDefenders would say that Sam could be rational in believing both that\nLucy was the thief, and in believing that his evidence doesn\u2019t\nsupport that claim. Against this view, Horowitz (2014) maintains that\nhigher-order evidence should affect our first-order attitudes whenever\nwe expect our evidence to be truth-guiding (which rationally we almost\nalways should); the conjunction involved in an akratic belief is thus\nrationally unstable (Horowitz 2014, p. 740). (See also Lasonen-Aarnio\n2020 for the argument that epistemically akratic subjects, while\nsometimes rational, nonetheless manifest bad dispositions).\n3.4.2 Addiction as Akrasia?\n\n\nThere has also been growing interest in the question of whether\naddiction is perhaps best understood as a form of akrasia.\nBuilding on the arguments of Mele (2002), Nick Heather (2016) contends\nthat addiction shares the core features of akratic action and should be\nunderstood as a special kind of akrasia, one in which agents\nconsistently act against both their present judgments and their prior\nresolutions (Heather 2016 p. 133\u20134). Heather thus accepts\nHolton\u2019s (1999) distinction between akrasia and weakness\nof will, but argues that addiction paradigmatically involves both\nhalves of this distinction.\n\n\nIn contrast, Edmund Henden (2016) argues against classifying\naddiction as a form of weakness of will. He thinks that the\nphenomenology of addiction tells against such an assimilation.\nAddiction often involves habitual behavior, and relapses are often\ntriggered by environmental cues that the addict is not conscious of at\nthe time of action. Addicts may continue to take drugs even when they\ndon\u2019t find it pleasurable to do so, and while retaining a strong\nsense of the disvalue of this course of action (Henden 2016, p. 122).\nIn these respects, Henden contends that addiction is unlike giving into\ntemptation, as paradigm examples of akrasia are often\ndescribed.\n\n\nHenden also notes that weakness of will seems rationally\ncriticizable in a way that addiction does not, which suggests they\ncan\u2019t be the same phenomenon. Many addicts sincerely try very\nhard to abstain from using drugs. Though their effort may be\ninsufficient for them to succeed in abstaining, it may nonetheless be\nsufficient relative to ordinary standards. That is, if someone who was\nnot an addict made the same effort with respect to similar endeavors,\nit would be reasonable to expect her to succeed. The challenges that\nface addicts thus seem much more demanding than the challenges that\nface the average practical agent, including those prone to\nakrasia (Henden 2016, p. 123\u20134).\n",
