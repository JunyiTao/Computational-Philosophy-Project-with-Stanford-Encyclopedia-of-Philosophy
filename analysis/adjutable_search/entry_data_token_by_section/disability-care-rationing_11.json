    "main_text": "Disability as a systematic rationing consideration: ethical concerns || Health resource prioritization and the human right to health care\n4. A persistent dilemma?\n\nCurrently, the dilemma posed by whether, and how, disability should be\ntaken into account for health allocation remains unsolved, although it\nfrequently appears in the distributive justice literature as a test\ncase for some variant of egalitarianism or a refined version of CEA.\nEven if the dilemma is resolved, additional problems arise. If we\ndecide that disability is always a relevant allocation consideration,\nthen on the way to tackling the larger question of what the impact of\ndisability should be the question of comparability of varieties of\ndisability looms larger. It has recently been suggested that the\nso-called \u201cindexing problem\u201d created by the\nincommensurable components of human disadvantage (Woff and De-Shalit\n2007), which\nprevents any meaningful comparison between people experiencing very\ndifferent forms of social disadvantage is compounded when trying to\ncompare people with different disabilities. Comparing lower body\nparalysis with deafness is hard enough, but two people both of whom\nare paraplegic may experience it in vastly different ways depending on\nthe availability of wheelchairs and accommodations such as accessible\npublic buildings (Riddle 2014). If we decide that disability should\nnever matter, then it is difficult to see why any consideration of\neither cost or benefit, unrelated to disability, could also be\njustified. If so, then the only survivable allocation procedure would\nbe random allocation, which is highly counter-intuitive as a solution\nto head-to-head individual allocation decisions, let alone a general\nallocation policy. \n",
