    "main_text": "The PSR before Spinoza and Leibniz\n5. The PSR before Spinoza and Leibniz\n\nThe PSR is nearly as old as philosophy itself. Anaximander, one of the\nearliest of the pre-Socratics, is usually credited\u2014on the basis\nof Aristotle\u2019s de Caelo, (b12\n295b10\u201316)\u2014with being the first to make use of it.\nAnaximander argues, we are told, that the Earth remains stationary in\nspace because it is located in the center of the universe and thus is\n\u201cindifferently\u201d related to any \u201cextreme\npoint\u201d. This indifference means that if it were to move in any\ndirection, it would do so without a reason. Since he concludes from\nthis that it does not move, we can assume that Anaximander believes\nthat motion in the absence of a reason is impossible.\n\nParmenides, another pre-Socratic, implicitly appeals to the PSR when\nhe claims that the world cannot have come into existence because then\nit would have come from nothing (Fragment B8 9\u201310). It is\nagainst the later alternative that Parmenides appears to wield the\nPSR. Nothing comes from nothing because if it did, then we could ask:\nwhy did it not come into existence at an earlier or a later time than\nit actually did? Parmenides appears to think that if the world comes\ninto existence from nothing, then there is no possible answer to this\nquestion. After all, prior to the coming-to-be of the world, there is\nnothing to explain its coming-to-be. Thus, its coming-to-be would be\nan arbitrary brute fact. There are no brute facts regarding\ncoming-to-be. So, the world did not come into existence from\nnothing.\n\nAnother ancient source for the PSR is Archimedes who writes:\n\n\nEqual weights at equal distances are in equilibrium, and equal weights\nat unequal distances are not in equilibrium but incline towards the\nweight which is at the greater distance (On the Equilibrium of\nPlanes, 189).\n\n\nArchimedes assumes that if there is a balance such that there is no\ndifference between the weights and distances on either side, then\nneither side of the balance can move up or down. This is sometimes\ntaken to be an implicit application of the PSR and is cited by\nLeibniz in his correspondence with Clarke as a precedent for his own\nprinciple.\n\nIn the Islamic world, Avicenna appears to assume a version of the PSR\nwhen he claims that the existence or nonexistence of any non-necessary\npossible thing must have a cause outside itself. If it didn\u2019t,\nthen either the cause would be internal to the non-necessary possible\nthing (which Avicenna takes to be contrary to the nature of a (mere)\npossible being) or it doesn\u2019t have a cause at all.\nAvicenna\u2019s reasoning implicitly rejects this latter alternative\nand thus he appears to be committed that all existence and\nnonexistence has a cause (Avicenna, Metaphysics 1.6 \u00a71;\nAl-Shifa\u2019: Al-Ilahiyyat, 37; See Richardson\n747).\n\nIn the medieval Latin West, Peter Abelard argues that God must create\nthe best of all possible worlds in a way that both appears to\npresuppose some version of the PSR and anticipates Leibniz\u2019s\nreasoning on the subject. If God didn\u2019t, Abelard argues, there\nwould have to be some reason for it. But what reason could that be\nexcept God\u2019s injustice or jealousy? But God cannot be unjust or\njealous. So there is no possible reason for God making anything less\nthan the best. Everything has a reason. Thus God makes the best\npossible world (Op. cit. col. 1324b; McCallum 1948, 93).\nAbelard\u2019s opinion was rejected as heresy and mainstream opinion\nof philosophers during the Middle Ages in the Latin West appears to\nreject the PSR. God, on the mainstream medieval view, enjoys freedom\nof indifference with respect to his creation. Thus there is no\nsufficient reason for why God created what he did and the PSR slips\nfrom prominence until its early modern revival at the hands of Spinoza\nand Leibniz.\n\nSome great epistemological rationalists, such as Plato and Descartes,\nappear to endorse the unrestricted PSR but in fact do not. For\nexample, in the Timaeus Plato writes,\n\n\n[E]verything that comes to be must of necessity come to be by the\nagency of some cause, for it is impossible for anything to come to be\nwithout a cause. (28a4\u20135)\n\n\nThis passage appears to assert the unrestricted PSR. But Plato\nbelieves that there are things that are not among the things that\n\u201ccome to be,\u201d and some of these things have no cause\nor reason. For example, the Demiurge creates the world by imposing\norder on disorderly motion. The disorderly motion preexists the work\nof the Demiurge. It is uncaused and there is no reason for it.\n\nAt times, Descartes appears to endorse the unrestricted PSR. For\nexample, he argues for the existence of God in the third\nMediation on the basis of the principle that there must be at\nleast as much reality in the cause as in the effect. And he justifies\nthis causal principle by claiming that \u201cNothing comes from\nnothing\u201d. This appears to make him as much an adherent of the\nunrestricted PSR as Parmenides who, as we have seen, argues for his\nconclusions on the same basis. But elsewhere Descartes claims that God\ncreates the eternal truths, such as mathematical and metaphysical\ntruths (Letters to Mersenne, April 15, May 6, and 27, 1630; Fifth\nReplies, AT 7:380, CSM 2:261). Moreover, he claims that God\ncreates these truths by an act of will which is free and indifferent.\nThus there can be no reason for the creation any of these truths. If\nmathematical and metaphysical truths are contingent and yet have no\nsufficient reason according to Descartes, then his philosophy imposes\nserious restrictions on any PSR.\n",
