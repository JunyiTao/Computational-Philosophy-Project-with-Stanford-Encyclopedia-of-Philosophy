    "main_text": "Some Important Distinctions || Axiological Versus Deontological Formulations\n1.4 Axiological Versus Deontological Formulations\n\nConsider, now, the following formulation of the argument from evil,\nwhich, in contrast to the abstract version of the argument from evil\nset out in section 1.1, focuses on quite concrete types of evil: \n\nThere exist states of affairs in which animals die agonizing\ndeaths in forest fires, or where children undergo lingering suffering\nand eventual death due to cancer, and that (a) are intrinsically bad\nor undesirable, and (b) are such that any omnipotent person has the\npower to prevent them without thereby either allowing an equal or\ngreater evil, or preventing an equal or greater good.\nFor any state of affairs (that is actual), the existence of that\nstate of affairs is not prevented by anyone.\nFor any state of affairs, and any person, if the state of affairs\nis intrinsically bad, and the person has the power to prevent that\nstate of affairs without thereby either allowing an equal or greater\nevil, or preventing an equal or greater good, but does not do so,\nthen that person is not both omniscient and morally perfect.\n\n\nTherefore, from (1), (2), and (3):\n\nThere is no omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect\nperson.\nIf God exists, then he is an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally\nperfect person.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\nGod does not exist.\n\n \nAs it stands, this argument is deductively\nvalid.[2]\n(Here is a \nproof.)\nHowever it is likely to be challenged in various ways. In\nparticular, one vulnerable point is the claim, made in the last part\nof statement (1), that an omnipotent and omniscient person could have\nprevented those states of affairs without thereby either allowing an\nequal or greater evil, or preventing an equal or greater good, and\nwhen this is challenged, an inductive step will presumably be\nintroduced, one that moves from what we know about the undesirable\nstates of affairs in question to a conclusion about the overall value\nof those states of affairs, all things considered\u2014including things\nthat may well lie outside our ken. \n\nBut the above argument is subject to a very different sort of\ncriticism, one that is connected with a feature of the above argument\nwhich seems to me important, but which is not often commented \nupon\u2014the fact, namely, that the above argument is formulated in terms of\naxiological concepts, that is, in terms of the goodness or\nbadness, the desirability or undesirability, of states of\naffairs. The criticism that arises from this feature centers on\nstatement (3), which asserts that an omniscient and morally perfect\nbeing would prevent the existence of any states of affairs that are\nintrinsically bad or undesirable, and whose prevention he could\nachieve without either allowing an equal or greater evil, or\npreventing an equal or greater good. For one can ask how this claim\nis to be justified.  One answer that might be offered would be that\nsome form of consequentialism is true\u2014such as, for example, the\nview that an action that fails to maximize the balance of good states\nof affairs over bad states of affairs is morally wrong. But the\ndifficulty then is that any such assumption is likely to be a deeply\ncontroversial assumption that many theists would certainly\nreject.\n\nThe problem, in short, is that any axiological formulation of the\nargument from evil, as it stands, is incomplete in a crucial respect,\nsince it fails to make explicit how a failure to bring about\ngood states of affairs, or a failure to prevent bad states of affairs,\nentails that one is acting in a morally wrong way. Moreover, the\nnatural way of removing this incompleteness is by appealing to what\nare in fact controversial ethical claims, such as the claim that the\nright action is the one that maximizes expected value. The result, in\nturn, is that discussions may very well become sidetracked on issues\nthat are, in fact, not really crucial\u2014such as, for example, the\nquestion of whether God would be morally blameworthy if he failed to\ncreate the best world that he could.\n\nThe alternative to an axiological formulation is a deontological\nformulation.  Here the idea is that rather than employing concepts\nthat focus upon the value or disvalue of states of affairs, one\ninstead uses concepts that focus upon the rightness and wrongness of\nactions, and upon the properties\u2014rightmaking properties and\nwrongmaking properties\u2014that determine whether an action is one\nthat ought to be performed, or ought not to be performed, other\nthings being equal. When the argument is thus formulated, there is no\nproblematic bridge that needs to be introduced connecting the\ngoodness and badness of states of affairs with the rightness and\nwrongness of actions.\n",
