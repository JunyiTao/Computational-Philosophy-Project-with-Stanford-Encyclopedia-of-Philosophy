    "main_text": "Arguments for Closed Borders || Establishing Security\n1.5 Establishing Security\n\n\nSince 9/11, an increasingly popular justification for limiting\nimmigration is the need to secure the safety of one\u2019s\ncitizens. After all, given the presence of international\nterrorists, one can hardly question the threat posed by at least some\nforeigners.\n\n\nNo one can deny the moral importance of protecting innocent\ncivilians from terrorist attack, but critics have questioned whether\nrestricting immigration is in fact likely to provide the desired\nsecurity. Chandran Kukathas (2014), for instance, raises two\nimportant concerns. First, he notes that, while laws to limit\nimmigration may well decrease legal immigration, they will not\nrealistically be able to eliminate all illegal immigrants. And\nthis point is relevant, of course, because foreign terrorists who feel\nso passionately about their causes so as to be willing to carry out\nterrorist missions are not likely to be dissuaded from doing so by the\nillegality of entering the country whose citizens they seek to\nattack. Second, even if a state could somehow eliminate all legal\nand illegal immigration, this would not be enough because foreigners\nroutinely enter countries, not as immigrants, but for shorter periods\nas tourists, guest workers, visiting students, or for short business\ntrips. Thus, even if a country somehow managed to preclude all\nimmigration, it could not reasonably hope to exclude all foreign\nterrorists unless it also restricted the flow of temporary\nvisitors.\n",
