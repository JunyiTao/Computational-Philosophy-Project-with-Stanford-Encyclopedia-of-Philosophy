    "main_text": "Perspectives on connexive logic || Connexivity and relevance\n3.1 Connexivity and relevance\n\nRoutley (1978), see also Sylvan 1989 (2000, chapter 5), suggested a\nconception of connexive logic different from McCall\u2019s. If the\nrequirement of a connection between antecedent and succedent of a\nvalid implication is understood as a content connection, and if a\ncontent connection obtains if antecedent and succedent are\nrelevant to each other, then \u201cthe general classes of\nconnexive and relevant logics are one and the same\u201d (Routley\n1978, p. 393), cf. also Sarenac and Jennings 2003, where the\nconnection between McCall\u2019s connexive system\nCC1, presented in section 4.1, and relevance\npreservation is studied.\n\nSince every non-trivial system of connexive logic in the vocabulary of\nclassical logic has to omit some classical tautologies, and since the\nstandard paradoxes of non-relevant, material implication can be\navoided by rejecting Conjunctive Simplification, i.e., (A\n\u2227 B) \u2192 A and (A \u2227 B)\n\u2192 B, Routley requires for a connexive logic the\nrejection or qualification of Conjunctive Simplification (or\nequivalent schemata). Although according to Routley (1978, Routley\net al. 1982) and Routley and Routley (1985) the idea of\nnegation as cancellation, see sections 3.3 and 4.3., motivates both\nthe failure of Conjunctive Simplification and AT\u2019 and BT, the\nmodel-theoretic semantics for connexive logics developed in Routley\n1978, see section 4.2, makes use of what has later come to be known as\nthe Routley star negation, see the entry on\n negation.\n\nIf the contraposition rule and uniform substitution are assumed and\nimplication is transitive, the combination of Conjunctive\nSimplification and Aristotle\u2019s Theses results in negation\ninconsistency, i.e., there are formulas A such that\nA and its negation ~A are both theorems, see, for\nexample, Woods 1968 and Thompson 1991. Non-trivial negation\ninconsistent logics (with a transitive consequence relation) must be\nparaconsistent. Using certain three-valued truth tables, Mortensen\n(1984) pointed out that there are inconsistent but non-trivial systems\nsatisfying both AT\u2032 and Simplification. Examples of non-trivial\ninconsistent systems of connexive logic satisfying Conjunctive\nSimplification are presented in section 4.5. The availability of such\nconnexive systems may be appreciated in view of the fact that\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory based on a system of connexive logic with\nSimplification is inconsistent, see Wiredu 1974. Mortensen (1984) also\npointed out that the addition of AT\u2032 to the relevance logic\nR of Anderson and Belnap has a trivializing effect, a\nfact shown in Routley et al. 1982 as well.\n\nThe relation between connexive logic and relevance logic can also be\nseen as follows. Let A and B be contingent formulas\nof classical propositional logic, i.e., formulas that are neither\nconstantly false nor constantly true. It is well-known that then the\nfollowing holds in classical logic:\n\nNot: ~A \u22a2 A\nIf A \u22a2 B, then not: A \u22a2\n~B\nIf A \u22a2 B, then A and B\nshare some propositional variable (sentence letter)\n\n\nIf property (iii) is generalized to arbitrary formulas A and\nB, it is called the variable sharing property or\nvariable sharing principle, which is generally seen as a\nnecessary condition on a logic to count as a relevance logic (see the\nentry\n logic: relevance).\n So-called containment logics (also called Parry\nsystems or systems of analytic implication, see Parry\n1933, Anderson and Belnap 1975, Fine 1986, Ferguson 2015), satisfy the\nstrong relevance requirement that if \u22a2 A \u2192\nB, then every propositional variable of B is also a\npropositional variable of A. The variable sharing property\nindicates a content connection between A and B if\nB is derivable from A (or, semantically, A\nentails B). The properties (i) and (ii) may be viewed to\nexpress a content connection requirement on the derivability relation\nin a negative way. If one wants to express these constraints\nin terms of the provability of object language formulas, one naturally\narrives at Aristotle\u2019s and Boethius\u2019 theses.\n\nConnexive relevance logics that combine the ternary frame semantics\nfrom relevance logic and the adjustment of falsity conditions along\nthe lines of the connexive logic C (see section\n4.5.1) have been studied in Omori 2016a and Francez 2019, cf. sections\n4.2 and 4.5.\n",
