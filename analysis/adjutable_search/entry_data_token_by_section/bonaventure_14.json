    "main_text": "God || Bonaventure\u2019s Aitiological Argument\n5.3 Bonaventure\u2019s Ontological Argument\n\nBonaventure was the first thirteenth-century thinker to pay serious\nattention to the ontological argument. He read the Proslogion\nof Anselm through Aristotelian lenses. Now Aristotle had recognized\nthree different kinds of scientific principles: common axioms\ngoverning all thought, so well-known that no one can deny them, and\nproper principles limited in range to a given science\u2014its\ndefinitions and postulates. Anselm seemed to mean that God\u2019s\nexistence is an axiom of thought known by all humans, and Bonaventure\nagrees:\n\n\nsince our intellect is never deficient in knowing about God if it\nis, so it cannot be ignorant of God\u2019s existence, absolutely\nspeaking, nor even think God does not exist. (In I Sent. d.\n8, a. 1, q. 2 concl. [Quaracchi I: 154b]; trans. Houser and Noone\n2013, 107)\n\n\nWhile Anselm thought this conclusion rules out even the possibility of\natheism, Bonaventure more realistically shows how atheism is possible.\nThe problem is with our defective knowledge of God\u2019s\nnature. Error there can lead by logical inference to the\nconclusion that God does not exist in the first place. We are\nspontaneously theists but can convince ourselves to become atheists.\nInadequate definition of God points to a second problem. Knowing God\nexists is similar to knowing axioms because both are recognized by\nall. The difference is that we are quite certain \u201cthe whole is\ngreater than the part\u201d, because the terms involved in this axiom\nare so familiar to us; but about God\u2019s existence we have more an\nopinion than certain knowledge, because we lack an adequate definition\nof God\u2019s nature.\n\nThere are two remedies for the defects in our knowledge of\n\u201cwhat\u201d God is, one taken from faith, the other from\nreason. Both make knowledge of God\u2019s existence more like a\npostulate known with certitude by the \u201cwise\u201d than like an\naxiom recognized by \u201call\u201d humans (Boethius, De\nhebdomadibus, 40). For Christian belief and for theology,\nGod\u2019s existence is an article of faith. The other remedy is\nBonaventure\u2019s adaptation of Anselm\u2019s argument conceived as\na philosophical argument on behalf of a metaphysical postulate.\n\nBonaventure\u2019s ontological argument contains two moments, so to\nspeak, one negative, the other positive. Negatively,\nBonaventure\u2019s ontological argument proceeds as a reduction to\nabsurdity of the atheistic proposition. Anselm had taken a peculiar\ndescription of God, \u201csomething than which a greater cannot be\nthought\u201d, which Augustine had used to argue through a\nreductio ad absurdum to the conclusion that God must be\nincorruptible, and Boethius used to argue that God must be good, and\nhe had used it to argue by reductio that God must exist in\nthe first place. Bonaventure recognized the affinity with arguing by\nreductio in support of the principle of\nnon-contradiction:\n\n\nAs a union of things in the greatest degree distant from each other is\nentirely repugnant to our intellect, because no intellect can think\nthat one thing at the same time both is and is not, so also\nthe division of something entirely one and undivided is entirely\nrepugnant to that same intellect. For this reason, just as it is most\nevidently false to say that the same thing is and is not, so\nalso it is most evidently false to say at the same time that the same\nthing is in the greatest degree and in no way is. (De\nmysterio trinitatis. 1.1, concl. [Quaracchi V: 49]; trans. Hayes\n1979, 116 [modified])\n\n\nBut his study of Aristotelian philosophy made Bonaventure more\nsensitive than Anselm to the limitations of reductio\narguments. Positive insight into principles is more than negative\nreductio leading up to principles, so snaring the atheist in\na contradiction is still one step away from affirming that God exists.\nTo make this step intelligible he emended the ontological argument in\na positive direction.\n\nBonaventure therefore explains what makes a proposition\n\u201cself-evident\u201d, which in turn opens the way for deducing\nGod\u2019s existence out of God\u2019s essence.\n\nPrinciples are \u201cself-evident\u201d (cf. Aristotle,\nTopics, 100a31\u2013b21). In the second of Aristotle\u2019s\nmodes of per se (Aristotle, Posterior Analytics,\n73a34\u2013b3), the essence of the subject causes the\npredicate. This provided Bonaventure with an ingenious explanation of\nwhy principles are self-evident:\n\n\nWe know principles to the extent that we understand the terms which\nmake them up, because the cause of the predicate is included\nin the subject.\n\n\nIf the essence of the subject term is what connects it to the\npredicate term in a self-evident proposition, then the essence of God\nmust be what makes \u201cGod exists\u201d self-evident. The positive\nontological argument contains an inference to the existence of God\nthat runs through the divine essence.\n\nMost descriptions of the divine essence are inappropriate for the\nontological argument, but the transcendentals are the right terms\nbecause they do not imply imperfection, can be predicated\nnon-metaphorically of God, and are primordial, the \u201cfirst\nnotions falling into the mind\u201d (Journey 3.3 [Quaracchi\nV: 304a]; cf. Avicenna, Metaphysica 1.5). All more specific\nconcepts presuppose transcendental notions, and Anselm\u2019s own\nformula was no exception to this rule. In his Commentary on the\nSentences Bonaventure used the transcendental \u201ctrue\u201d\nas the middle term of his positive ontological argument; in the\ndisputed question On the Mystery of the Trinity he used\n\u201cgood\u201d, and in the Journey of the Mind to God he\nused \u201cbeing\u201d.\n\nIn the Commentary, Bonaventure introduces his arguments for\nGod\u2019s existence with an elaborate treatment of truth. As a\nrelation, truth always involves a comparison. Epistemological truth is\nan \u201cindivision\u201d between the human mind and the thing\nknown. Ontological truth is an \u201cindivision\u201d between\npotency and act within a creature; the more it fulfills its nature,\nthe truer it is. These two senses of truth open up a comparison of\ncreature as participant to God as exemplar. All three,\nepistemological, ontological, participationist truths, are imperfect,\ncombinations of truth and falsity. They point to their exemplar, the\none \u201cpure\u201d truth, present only in God, where there is\n\u201cpure indivision mixed with no diversity\u201d (In I\nSent. d. 8, art. 1, q. 1 concl. [Quaracchi I: 151b]). This last\nsense of truth Bonaventure uses in his ontological argument:\n\n\nWe know principles to the extent that we understand the terms\nwhich make them up, because the cause of the predicate is included in\nthe subject. This is why principles are self-evident. The same\nthing is true about God. For God, or the highest truth, is being\nitself, that than which nothing greater can be thought. Therefore, God\ncannot be thought not to be, for the predicate is already included in\nthe subject. (In I Sent. d. 8, art. 1, q. 2 concl. [Quaracchi\nI: 155a; trans. Houser and Noone 2013, 108])\n\n\nBonaventure includes the negative reasoning so prominent in\nAnselm\u2019s version, but to Anselm\u2019s formula he adds\n\u201cbeing itself\u201d and \u201cthe highest truth\u201d. While\neach of these three descriptions casts a different light on why the\ninference to God\u2019s existence is valid, Bonaventure here seems to\nprefer \u201cthe highest truth\u201d because the definition of truth\nas \u201cindivision\u201d is the basis for re-conceiving the\nontological argument as establishing an \u201cindivision\u201d\nbetween the middle term and the predicate \u201cexists\u201d. If the\n\u201chighest truth\u201d is \u201cpure indivision\u201d, then the\nhighest truth cannot be divided off from existence.\n\nIn On the Mystery of the Trinity, Bonaventure changes the\nfocus of the ontological argument to goodness, with a memorable\nresult. The basic notion of goodness is not by itself sufficient to\nmount an ontological argument, but analysis of goodness uncovers the\nrelevant terms:\n\n\nNo one can be ignorant of the fact that this is true: the best is the\nbest; or think that it is false. But the best is a being which is\nabsolutely complete. Now any being which is absolutely complete, for\nthis very reason, is an actual being. Therefore, if the best is the\nbest, the best is. In a similar way, one can argue: If God is God,\nthen God is. Now the antecedent is so true that it cannot be thought\nnot to be. Therefore, it is true without doubt that God exists.\n(De mysterio trinitatis 1.1 fund. 29 [Quaracchi V: 48];\ntrans. authors)\n\n\nThe logic of \u201cthe best\u201d (optimum) is different\nfrom the logic of \u201cthe good\u201d. Since goodness completes or\nperfects something, \u201cthe best\u201d must be \u201ca being\nwhich is fully complete (ens completissimum)\u201d. Now what\nis absolutely complete must possess all possible perfections. But\nexistence is not just a perfection, one component among many\nmaking up such ontological completeness, it is the most\nfundamental feature of such completeness. Consequently, such an\nabsolutely perfect being must exist. Bonaventure\u2019s argument runs\nfrom the subject \u201cGod\u201d, through the middle terms\n\u201cthe best\u201d and \u201cabsolutely complete being\u201d, to\nthe predicate \u201cexists\u201d. In the shorter and even more\nmemorable formulation, \u201cIf God is God, God is\u201d, the\npremise If God is God is not an empty tautology (Seifert\n1992: 216\u2013217). It means \u201cif the entity to which the term\nGod refers truly possesses the divine essence\u201d. And the\nconclusion means that such an entity must exist.\n\nBonaventure was well aware of criticisms of the ontological argument,\nbeginning with Gaunilo\u2019s retort that the greatest of all\npossible islands should also really exist. His reply is more effective\nthan Anselm\u2019s because it uses the transcendentals. An island is\nan inherently imperfect being (ens defectivum) because\ncategorical; but ens completissimum is not because a\ntranscendental (De mysterio trinitatis 1.1 ad 6\n[Quaracchi V: 50]).\n\nIn The Journey of the Mind to God, c. 5, Bonaventure focuses\nthe ontological argument on \u201cbeing\u201d and develops it far\nbeyond anything he had previously done. He qualifies esse in\ntwo different ways, creating two different middle terms: \u201cdivine\nbeing\u201d (esse divinum) and \u201ccompletely pure being\n(esse purissimum)\u201d. First he uses \u201ccompletely\npure being\u201d to deduce the predicate \u201cexists\u201d, then\nuses \u201cdivine being\u201d to ensure that it is God who\nis so proven to exist. In this way the basic steps of this argument\nclosely parallel those of the argument based on goodness:\n\n\nGod (Deus) who is divine being (esse divinum) is\nalso seen to be completely pure being (esse purissimum) and\ntherefore must exist (est).\n\n\nBonaventure begins (Journey 5.3 [Quaracchi V:\n 308])[25]\n by repeating the essentials of the earlier versions of the argument,\nbut then moves well beyond them:\n\n\nFor completely pure being itself occurs only in full flight from\nnon-being, just as nothingness is in full flight from being.\nTherefore, complete nothingness contains nothing of being or its\nattributes, so by contrast being itself contains no non-being, neither\nin act nor in potency, neither in reality nor in our thinking about\nit. (Journey 5.3 [Quaracchi V: 308]; trans.\n authors[26])\n\n\nIf \u201cbeing itself\u201d (ipsum esse) distinguishes the\nbeing (esse) of a creature from its independent existence\n(existere), adding the superlative completely pure\nto being itself (esse purissimum) refers to the\nnotion of an essence that does not involve non-being in\nany way: a completely pure or perfect essence. The notion of\nesse purissimum does not presuppose the real existence of\nGod; rather, it implies that real existence. But at this point this\ninference may not yet be clear, so Bonaventure devotes the rest of\nthis short text to showing why the notion of completely pure being\nitself actually entails the real existence of God.\n\nIn contrast with creatures, which are mid-level on the scale of being\nbecause they are open to existence and non-existence, the notions of\ncomplete nothingness (omnino nihil) and completely pure being\n(esse purissimum) have absolutely opposed implications for\nexistence. \u201cComplete nothing-ness\u201d is logically\ninconsistent with real existence, so there is a perfectly valid\ninference from the notion of nothing to non-being\n(non-esse). Nothing cannot exist. If the nature of nothing\nentails its non-existence, the nature of its opposite, completely\npure being, entails its real existence. Making use of the\ncategories of his own metaphysics in this way shows more effectively\nthan merely backing the mind into a contradiction why the ontological\ninference is valid.\n\nThe basis for the argument thus far is a notion, not of God but of an\nessence, completely pure, of non-being. One might ask where\nBonaventure acquires this notion, seemingly drawn from thin air. His\nreply is that conceptual analysis of the first of all notions,\ntranscendental being (ens), reveals this purely metaphysical\nnotion.\n\n\nNow since non-being is the privation of being, it does not fall into\nthe mind except through being; while being does not fall into the mind\nthrough something else. For everything which is thought of is either\nthought of as a non-being, or as a being in potency, or as a being in\nact. Therefore, if a non-being is intelligible only through a being,\nand a being in potency is intelligible only through a being in act,\nand being denominates the pure actuality of a being, it follows that\nbeing is that which first falls into the intellect, and that this\nbeing is that which is pure actuality. (Journey 5.3\n[Quaracchi V: 308]; trans.\n authors)[27]\n\n\nHere Bonaventure peers into the notion of \u201ca being\u201d\n(ens) and finds it has two component principles: independent\nexistence (existere), which gives the being the potential to\nhave a certain essence; and being (esse), the actuality of\nsuch an essence. It is esse rather than existere\nwhich \u201cdenominates the pure actuality of a being\u201d. Here\n\u201cactuality\u201d (actus) means \u201cthat which makes\nthe being actually intelligible, by giving it the actual essence it\nhas\u201d. This movement of conceptual analysis opens the\nmind to see that we can understand a creature as \u201ca being\u201d\n(ens) only by referring to the notion of an act of being\nwhich is pure from non-being (esse purum), indeed, which is\npure from any non-being (esse purissimum). Implicit\nwithin the very notion of transcendental \u201cbeing\u201d\nand a presupposition of our understanding the notion of\ntranscendental being, is the notion of being with no hint of\nnon-being (esse purissimum). Even if only implicit, this\nnotion must be present in the mind of anyone who understands being\n(ens), that is, everyone who understands anything at all.\n\nOnce it has been shown that esse purissimum is a notion which\nimplies real existence and that we all possess this notion as a\ncomponent of the fundamental notion of a being (ens), it\nremains only to identify esse purissimum with God.\n\n\nBut this is not particular being, which is limited being because mixed\nwith potency, nor is it analogous being, because that has the least\nactuality, since it is to the least degree. Therefore, the result is\nthat this being is divine being. (Journey 5.3 [Quaracchi V:\n308\u2013309]; trans.\n authors)[28]\n\n\nIf esse purissimum really exists, as has been proven, it must\nexist in one of three modes. But since particular and intentional\nbeing cannot be completely perfect, esse purissimum must be\nidentical with the divine being.\n\nThe real but initially hidden starting point for Bonaventure\u2019s\nontological argument in the Journey is the notion of esse\npurissimum, taken not subjectively as existing as a concept in a\nhuman mind, but in its objective\n meaning,[29]\n that is, as signifying a certain kind of quiddity or essence. The\nachievement of the ontological argument, as Bonaventure saw it, is\ntwofold: it shows that this essence must really exist, and it shows\nthat this essence is none other than God.\n\nBonaventure locates knowledge of God\u2019s existence within all\nthree parts of an Aristotelian science\u2014as demonstrated\nconclusion, as common axiom, and as proper postulate. It can be proven\nthrough two kinds of demonstrations of the fact, by an illumination\nargument starting inside the mind and an aitiological argument\nstarting outside. Such proofs proceed from created truth as a\nvestige to the one God as its cause. But \u201cGod\nexists\u201d is also a principle recognized by virtually all humans,\na kind of axiom built upon creatures conceived as shadows of\nthe one divinity for whom explicit arguments specifying\nGod\u2019s causality are no more needed than for other axioms.\nFinally, there are two ways God\u2019s existence is known as a\npostulate: first, through the ontological argument, where the\ntranscendental attributes found in creatures function as\nvestiges providing the mind the notions it uses in the\nargument for the one God\u2019s existence; and second, as an\narticle of faith. Here faith is postulated on the authority of\nrevelation and is certain, but its certainty comes from God, not human\nreason. And here, too, features of intellectual creatures, especially\nhumans, function as images and likenesses of the\nTrinitarian God. Knowledge of God\u2019s existence, in sum,\nis ubiquitous. Thus spoke the follower of Francis.\n",
