As many second wave feminist critics of Marx have pointed\nout, however, Marx\u2019s categories are gender-blind (see, for\nexample, Firestone 1970, Hartmann 1980, Hartsock 1983, Rubin 1976).\nMarx ignores the ways in which class exploitation and gender\nsubordination are intertwined; because he focuses solely on economic\nproduction, Marx overlooks women\u2019s reproductive labor in the\nhome and the exploitation of this labor in capitalist modes of\nproduction. As a result of this gender-blindness, second wave Marxist\nor socialist feminists argued that Marx\u2019s analysis of class\ndomination must be supplemented with a radical feminist critique of\npatriarchy in order to yield a satisfactory account of women\u2019s\noppression; the resulting theory is referred to as dual systems theory\n(see, for example, Eisenstein 1979, Hartmann 1980). As Young describes\nit, \u201cdual systems theory says that women\u2019s oppression\narises from two distinct and relatively autonomous systems. The system\nof male domination, most often called \u2018patriarchy\u2019,\nproduces the specific gender oppression of women; the system of the\nmode of production and class relations produces the class oppression\nand work alienation of most women\u201d (Young 1990b, 21). Although\nYoung agrees with the aim of theorizing class and gender domination in\na single theory, she is critical of dual systems theory on the grounds\nthat \u201cit allows Marxism to retain in basically unchanged form\nits theory of economic and social relations, on to which it merely\ngrafts a theory of gender relations\u201d (Young 1990b, 24). Young\ncalls instead for a more unified theory, a truly feminist historical\nmaterialism that would offer a critique of the social totality.\n\nIn a later essay, Young offers a more systematic analysis of\noppression, an analysis that is grounded in her earlier call for a\ncomprehensive socialist feminism. Young identifies five faces of\noppression: economic exploitation, socio-economic marginalization,\nlack of power or autonomy over one\u2019s work, cultural imperialism,\nand systematic violence (Young 1992, 183\u2013193). The first three\nfaces of oppression in this list expand on the Marxist account of\neconomic exploitation, and the last two go beyond that account,\nbringing out other aspects of oppression that are not well explained\nin economic terms. According to Young, being subject to any one of\nthese forms of power is sufficient to call a group oppressed, but most\noppressed groups in the United States experience more than one of\nthese forms of power, and some experience all five (Young 1992, 194).\nShe also claims that this list is comprehensive, both in the sense\nthat \u201ccovers all the groups said by new left social movements to\nbe oppressed\u201d and that it \u201ccovers all the ways they are\noppressed\u201d (Young 1992, 181; for critical discussion, see Allen\n2008b).\n\nNancy Hartsock offers a different vision of feminist historical\nmaterialism in her book Money, Sex, and Power: Toward a\nFeminist Historical Materialism (1983). In this book, Hartsock is\nconcerned with \u201c(1) how relations of domination along lines of\ngender are constructed and maintained and (2) whether social\nunderstandings of domination itself have been distorted by men\u2019s\ndomination of women\u201d (Hartsock 1983, 1). Following Marx\u2019s\nconception of ideology, Hartsock maintains that the prevailing ideas\nand theories of a time period are rooted in the material, economic\nrelations of that society. This applies, in her view, to theories of\npower as well. Thus, she criticizes theories of power in mainstream\npolitical science for presupposing a market model of economic\nrelations \u2013 a model that understands the economy primarily in\nterms of exchange, which is how it appears from the perspective of the\nruling class rather than in terms of production, which is how it\nappears from the perspective of the worker. She also argues that power\nand domination have consistently been associated with masculinity.\nBecause power has been understood from the position of the socially\ndominant \u2013 the ruling class and men \u2013 the feminist task,\naccording to Hartsock, is to reconceptualize power from a specifically\nfeminist standpoint, one that is rooted in women\u2019s life\nexperience, specifically, their role in reproduction. Conceptualizing\npower from this standpoint can, according to Hartsock, \u201cpoint\nbeyond understandings of power as power over others\u201d (Hartsock\n1983, 12). (We\u2019ll come back to this point in section 4).\n\nSocialist feminism fell largely out of fashion during the latter part\nof the 20th century, fueled in part by the rise of poststructuralism,\nthe prominence of identity and recognition based politics, and the\nemergence of a neoliberal consensus (for a trenchant critique of these\ndevelopments, see Fraser 1996 and 2013). However, in the wake of the\nglobal financial crisis of 2008, socialist feminism, now often\nreferred to as Social Reproduction Theory (SRT), has made a comeback.\nSRT has a long history, with important early contributions by Silvia\nFederici (1975) and Maria Mies (1986) and connections to the Italian\nwages for housework campaign that began in the 1970s; for more recent\ndiscussions, see Tithi Bhattacharya (2017), Federici (2014 and 2019),\nand Alessandra Mezzadri (2019). SRT is a Marxist feminist project that\norients itself to a question that remains implicit in Marx's theory of\nvalue: how is labor power, which is the source of value and thus of\nexploitation in Marx's account, itself produced, reproduced, and\nmaintained? SRT maintains that labor power is produced and reproduced\noutside of the official economy, largely through women's unpaid labor\nwithin the family or domestic sphere. For social reproduction\ntheorists, the production of goods and services is thus possible only\non the basis of (largely) unpaid social reproduction, which includes\nchildbirth, domestic work, caring for children, the elderly and others\nwho cannot work for wages, and so on. For Federici, this represents an\nongoing process of expropriation akin to Marx's notion of primitive\naccumulation (Federici 2014). Social reproduction theorists understand\nproduction and reproduction as parts of an integrated system; indeed,\nthey view the distinction between the two as ultimately misleading\ninasmuch as it obscures the ways in which social reproduction is\nitself productive of value (Mezzadri 2019). For a related attempt to\nunderstand capitalism as a social totality whose relations of\nproduction are made possible by the expropriation of socially\nreproductive labor, environmental resources, and the labor of\ndispossessed and colonized peoples, see Fraser in Fraser and Jaeggi\n(2018).\n",
