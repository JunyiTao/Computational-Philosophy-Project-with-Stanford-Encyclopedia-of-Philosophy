    "main_text": "Probability-raising Theories of Causation || Conclusion and Further Reading\n2.7 Conclusion and Further Reading\n\nThe program described in this section did much to illuminate the\nrelationship between causation and probability. In particular, it\nhelped us to better understand the way in which causal structure can\ngive rise to probabilistic relations of screening off. However,\ndespite the mathematical framework of the program, and points of\ncontact with statistics and experimental methodology, this program did\nnot give rise to any new computational tools, or suggest any new\nmethods for detecting causal relationships. For this reason, the\nprogram has largely been supplanted by the causal modeling tools\ndescribed in the next section.\n\nThe main works surveyed in this section are Reichenbach 1956, Suppes\n1970, Cartwright 1979, Skyrms 1980, and Eells 1991. Williamson 2009\nand Hitchcock 2016 are two further surveys that cover a number of the\ntopics discussed in this section. The entries for\n Hans Reichenbach\n and\n Reichenbach\u2019s Common Cause Principle\n include discussions of Reichenbach\u2019s program and the status of\nhis Common Cause Principle. Salmon (1984) contains an extensive\ndiscussion of conjunctive forks. The entry for\n Simpson\u2019s paradox\n contains further discussion of some of the issues raised in\n Section 2.4.\n",
