    "main_text": "The Deeper Disagreement\n4. The Deeper Disagreement\n\nAs noted above, Frege views Hilbert\u2019s reinterpretations as\ninvolving a shift of attention from geometric thoughts (whose\nconsistency and independence are at issue) to thoughts of a wholly\ndifferent kind, those about the background theory B (whose consistency\nand independence are not in question). Regarding consistency proofs,\nhis view is that Hilbert makes an illegitimate inference from the\nconsistency of a collection \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) of thoughts about real\nnumbers to the consistency of a collection \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\) of\nthoughts about geometric points, lines, and planes. Frege acknowledges\nthat Hilbert\u2019s set AX of sentences can be understood as\nproviding an implicit definition of an abstract relation\n\\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\), one that is satisfied by Hilbert\u2019s\nconstructed n-tuples, and that the consistency (i.e.,\nsatisfiability) of \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) entails the consistency of that\ndefined relation. But here too, Frege takes it that Hilbert\u2019s\ncrucial inference, from the consistency of \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) to the\nconsistency of \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\), is problematic. As Frege himself\nputs it, referring to \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) and \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\) as\n\u201cspecial geometries\u201d, and to \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) as the\n\u201cgeneral case:\u201d \n\n\n[G]iven that the axioms in special geometries are all special cases of\ngeneral axioms, one can conclude from lack of contradiction in a\nspecial geometry to lack of contradiction in the general case, but not\nto lack of contradiction in another special case. (Letter of January\n6, 1900 in Frege 1980: 48)\n\n\nOnce he has pointed out what he takes to be the questionable\ninference, Frege takes it that the burden of argument is squarely with\nHilbert: if Hilbert thinks that the consistency of \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\)\nfollows from either the consistency of \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) or from the\nsatisfiability of \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\), then it is up to Hilbert to\nshow this. Frege does not go out of his way to demonstrate that the\ncrucial inference is invalid, but seems to take his point to have been\nessentially made once he has pointed out the need for a justification\nhere. \n\nFrom Hilbert\u2019s point of view, of course, there is no need for\nsuch a justification. The differences that Frege insists on over and\nover again between the sets of sentences (AX) and the different\nsets of thoughts (\\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\), \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) etc.) are\nentirely inconsequential from Hilbert\u2019s standpoint. Because\nconsistency as Hilbert understands it applies to the\n\u201cscaffolding\u201d of concepts and relations defined by\nAX when its geometric terms are taken as place-holders, the\nconsistency he has in mind holds (to put it in terms of thoughts) of\n\\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\) iff it holds of \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\), since both\nsets of thoughts are instantiations of the same\n\u201cscaffolding\u201d. The same point can be put in terms of\nsentences: Frege insists that the consistency-question that arises for\nthe sentences under their geometric interpretation is a different\nissue from the one that arises for those sentences under their\nreal-number interpretation; for Hilbert on the other hand, there is\njust one question, and it is answered in the affirmative if there is\nany interpretation under which the sentences express truths. Hence\nwhile Frege takes it that Hilbert owes an explanation of the inference\nfrom the consistency of \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) to that of\n\\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\), for Hilbert there is simply no inference.\n\nFrege\u2019s lack of clarity about his reasons for rejecting\nHilbert\u2019s procedure leaves an interpretive gap, with respect to\nwhich there is room for controversy. We should recall, to begin with,\nthat Hilbert is clearly right that his own reinterpretation strategy\nsuffices for the relative consistency and independence results he\nclaims. If consistency and independence are understood, as above, in\nterms of non-provability, and if proof is, as Hilbert\nassumes, independent of the meanings of geometric terms, then\n\\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\), \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\), and even AX itself\nare all consistent if one of them is. Frege\u2019s rejection of\nHilbert\u2019s technique must involve, then, either some confusion\nabout what Hilbert has established, or a different understanding of\nwhat is at issue in claims of consistency and independence. \n\nOne way to understand Frege\u2019s contribution to the Frege-Hilbert\ndebate, then, is to recognize the contributions Frege makes in\nclarifying Hilbert\u2019s own approach to axioms, but to hold that\nFrege\u2019s negative assessment of Hilbert\u2019s technique for\nproving consistency and independence is mistaken. On this account,\ndespite the difference between Frege and Hilbert over the nature of\naxioms, nevertheless the satisfiability of \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) does\nshow the consistency of the collection of axioms in question, whether\none conceives of those axioms in Hilbert\u2019s way as sentences\n(i.e., as the collection AX) or in Frege\u2019s way as\nthoughts (i.e., as the collection \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\)). Similarly for\nindependence. Frege\u2019s mistake, on this view, is to have failed\nto notice that the kind of non-provability result (i.e.,\nconsistency or independence) that Hilbert takes his reinterpretations\nto demonstrate for geometric sentences entails a corresponding\nnon-provability (consistency or independence) result for geometric\nthoughts (see Resnik 1974, Currie 1982, Dummett 1975). \n\nThe alternative interpretation argues that Frege\u2019s understanding\nof consistency and independence is sufficiently different from\nHilbert\u2019s that the entailment in question does not hold: that\nthe satisfiability of \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\), and the consequent\nconsistency in Hilbert\u2019s sense of AX, does not entail the\nconsistency in Frege\u2019s sense of \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\). Similarly\nfor independence. According to this interpretation, Frege is right to\nclaim that Hilbert\u2019s demonstrations fail to show consistency and\nindependence in the sense in which he, Frege, understands these\n terms.[9]\n\nThe central idea of the alternative interpretation is that for Frege,\nthe question whether a given thought is logically entailed by a\ncollection of thoughts is sensitive not just to the formal structure\nof the sentences used to express those thoughts, but also to the\ncontents of the simple (e.g., geometric) terms that appear in those\nsentences. If this is correct, then we see immediately that the\nconsistency of \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) need not entail the consistency of\n\\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\), since the question whether \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\)\nlogically entails a contradiction may turn in part on the specifically\ngeometric parts of the thoughts in question, i.e., on the usual\ngeometric meanings of AX\u2019s geometric terms. To choose an\nillustrative example, though not one that Frege himself gives,\nconsider the pair of sentences\n\nPoint B lies on a line between points A and\nC; \nPoint B does not lie on a line between points C and\nA.\n\n\nThis pair of sentences is demonstrably consistent in Hilbert\u2019s\nsense. But on the interpretation of Frege suggested here, this\nconsistency (in Hilbert\u2019s sense) does not ensure that the\nthoughts expressed by these sentences under their ordinary\ninterpretation form a consistent collection. If, for example, Frege\nunderstands the relation \u2019between\u2019 as susceptible to\nconceptual analysis, in accordance with which the first thought can be\nseen to logically entail the negation of the second, then the pair of\nthoughts are inconsistent with one another in the straightforward\nsense of logically entailing a contradiction. \n\nThe idea that Frege takes logical entailment to be sensitive to\nconceptual analysis in the way just suggested is taken, on this\naccount, to be evident in the strategy Frege employs in his life-long\nattempt to demonstrate his logicist thesis, the thesis that the truths\nof arithmetic are provable from pure logic. In the course of that\nproject, Frege regularly provides demonstrations that a given thought\n\u03c4 follows logically from a set T of thoughts, in a way that\ninvolves two steps. First, Frege subjects \u03c4 and/or the members of\nT to conceptual analysis, bringing out previously-unrecognized\nconceptual complexity in those thoughts. Secondly, he proves the\nthus-analyzed version of \u03c4 from the thus-analyzed members of\nT. For example, Frege takes himself to demonstrate that the\nthought expressed by\n\n(i) The sum of two\nmultiples of a number is a multiple of that number\n\n\nfollows logically from the thoughts expressed by\n\n(ii)\n\\(\\forall m\\; \\forall n\\; \\forall p((m+n)+p = m+(n+p))\\)\n\n\n\nand by\n\n(ii)\n\\(\\forall n (n = n+0).\\)\n\n\n\nThe demonstration proceeds by providing a careful analysis of the\nnotion of \u201cmultiple of\u201d in terms of addition, giving us in\nplace of (i) a more-complex (i\u2032) which is then proven from (ii)\nand\n (iii).[10]\n Similarly, a significant part of Frege\u2019s logicist project\nconsists of the careful analysis of such arithmetical notions as\nzero and successor, analysis which brings out\npreviously-unnoticed complexity, and facilitates the proof of\narithmetical truths. (For a discussion of the logicist project, see\nentries on\n Frege\n and\n logicism and neologicism.)\n \n\nAs Frege puts it in the early pages of his Foundations of\nArithmetic, when we are trying to prove the truths of arithmetic\nfrom the simplest possible starting-points,\n\n\n\u2026 we very soon come to propositions which cannot be proved so\nlong as we do not succeed in analysing concepts which occur in them\ninto simpler concepts or in reducing them to something of greater\ngenerality. (Frege 1884: \u00a74)\n\n\nIn short: the components of thoughts can sometimes be analyzed in\nterms of simpler or more general constituents, in a way that brings to\nlight previously-hidden relations of logical entailment. Hence when we\nwant to know whether a given thought is logically entailed by a set of\nthoughts, we need to pay attention, from Frege\u2019s point of view,\nnot just to the overall structure exhibited by the sentences\nexpressing those thoughts, but also to the contents of the individual\nterms that appear in those sentences.\n\nThe connection between this aspect of Frege\u2019s work and his views\nregarding independence, on the interpretation in question, is as\nfollows. Because we can sometimes discover that a thought \u03c4 is\nlogically entailed by a set T of thoughts only after a careful\nanalysis of some of the apparently-simple components of those\nthoughts, so too we will sometimes be able to discover that a set of\nthoughts is inconsistent, i.e., that it logically entails a\ncontradiction, on the basis of such conceptual analysis. Hence the\nconsistency of the set of thoughts expressed by a set \u03a3 of\nsentences is something which turns not just on the overall structure\nof the sentences in \u03a3, but on the meanings of the terms\nappearing in \u03a3\u2019s sentences.\n\nTo clarify this last point, let\u2019s look at a non-mathematical\nexample, one which neither Hilbert nor Frege explicitly dealt with.\nConsider the set of sentences {Jones had a nightmare, Jones\ndidn\u2019t have a dream}, or equivalently its first-order rendition,\n\\(\\{Nj, {{\\sim}Dj}\\}\\). The set is clearly consistent in the sense\nused by Hilbert in FG; it is a straightforward matter to provide\ninterpretations of \u201cJones\u201d, \u201cx had a\nnightmare\u201d and \u201cx had a dream\u201d (or of\n\u201cj\u201d, \u201cN\u201d, and\n\u201cD\u201d) such that the sentences, so interpreted,\nexpress truths. (Consider, for example, an interpretation on which\n\u201cj\u201d is assigned the number 7,\n\u201cN\u201d the set of prime numbers, and\n\u201cD\u201d the set of numbers greater than 12.) But from\nthe Fregean point of view, the thoughts expressed are arguably\ninconsistent, since part of what it is to have a nightmare is to have\na dream. The inconsistency from Frege\u2019s point of view can be\ndemonstrated by providing an analysis of the thoughts expressed, and\nnoting that the results of this analysis yield the set {Jones had a\ndisturbing dream, Jones didn\u2019t have a dream}.\n\nFor the same reason, two sets of thoughts that are structurally\nsimilar in the sense that they can be expressed, under different\ninterpretations, by the same set of sentences, can differ with respect\nto Frege-consistency. As applied to the geometric context, the central\nidea, on this account of Frege\u2019s objection to Hilbert, is that\nthe kinds of re-interpretation in which Hilbert engages can take one\nfrom a consistent set of thoughts (e.g., \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\)) to an\ninconsistent one (e.g., \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\)) because of the shift in\nsubject-matter, hence invalidating the inference from the consistency\nof the first to the consistency of the second. \n\nFrege does not claim to be able to give specific geometric analyses\nwhich contradict particular consistency-claims of Hilbert\u2019s, and\nthere is no evidence that he takes any of those claims to be false.\nThat he might well have had some such analyses in mind is hinted at in\na letter to Hilbert in which he claims that in his own unfinished\ninvestigations into the foundations of geometry, he was able to\n\u201cmake do with fewer primitive terms\u201d, which presumably\nmeans that he takes some of the terms treated as primitive by Hilbert\nto be susceptible of analysis via others (see the letter to Hilbert of\nDecember 27, 1899 in Frege 1980: 34). Any such analysis would reveal\nrelations of logical dependence (from Frege\u2019s point of view)\nwhere Hilbert would find independence. \n\nBecause none of Frege\u2019s work on this topic has survived, we have\nno details about the specific analyses he might have given. The\ncrucial point in Frege\u2019s criticism of Hilbert, however, on this\naccount, is not a disagreement about particular analyses or the\nconsequent failure of particular consistency and independence claims,\nbut is instead about the general methodology of consistency and\nindependence proofs. Because for Hilbert the consistency of a set of\nsentences turns entirely on the overall structure they exhibit, while\nfor Frege the consistency of the set of thoughts expressed turns\nadditionally on the contents of the non-logical terms appearing in the\nsentences, on this account, Hilbert-consistency doesn\u2019t imply\nFrege-consistency.\n",
