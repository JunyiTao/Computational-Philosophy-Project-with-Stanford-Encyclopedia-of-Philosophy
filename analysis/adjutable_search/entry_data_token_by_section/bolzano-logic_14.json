    "main_text": "The objective connection among truths: grounding (Abfolge)\n8. Conclusion\n\nBolzano\u2019s TS, especially the Theory of Elements, is a\nturning point not only in logic, but also in epistemology. According\nto Cavaill\u00e8s (2008: 35),\n\n\nfor the first time perhaps, science is not considered as only\nmediating between the human mind and being in itself, dependent on\nboth and having no proper reality, but as an object sui\ngeneris, original in its essence, autonomous in its movement.\n\n\nScience is defined by its structure \u201cwhich not only is\ndemonstration, but which merges together with demonstration\u201d\n(ibid., 39). Stressing the fundamental role of demonstrations\nin scientific knowledge, Bolzano presented a viable alternative to\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics based on constructions in pure\nintuition.\n\n\nA truly scientific proof should ground the theorem, i.e.,\nintegrate it into a scientific theory organised according to the\n\u201cobjective connection of truths\u201d, starting with axioms and\nfundamental concepts.[\u2026]. These ideas indicate the direction of\nfuture research: the notion of normal proofs in the sense of Gentzen,\nproof trees, K\u00f6nig\u2019s lemma (\u0160ebest\u00edk 1992:\n478).\n\n\nWhile at least some of Bolzano\u2019s mathematical work was influential\nduring the nineteenth century, his logic met mostly with indifference\nand incomprehension. It was only towards the end of the century that\nphilosophers, notably Kerry, Twardowski, Meinong, and Husserl, began\nto appreciate his achievements. Curiously, Frege, whose ideas were\noften so close to those of Bolzano and who in his time was one of the\nfew logicians capable of understanding him, never mentions him in any\nof his publications or surviving papers. He was confronted with\nBolzano\u2019s ideas at least three times: in one of Kerry\u2019s\narticles, in correspondence with Husserl, and later in the controversy\nwith Korselt. We know of no evidence that he ever reacted to their\nallusions, and it is quite possible that he never laid hands on any of\nBolzano\u2019s works. Another interesting coincidence was noted by\nMancosu (1996, 110\u2013117 and note 69, p. 234): in \u00a7530 of\nTS, Bolzano argues that every indirect proof can be\ntransformed into a direct proof. Mancosu points out the striking\nsimilarity of this claim with one to the same effect presented by\nFrege in one of his posthumous writings (\u201cLogic in\nMathematics\u201d). In addition, Bolzano and Frege chose the very\nsame example (Euclid I.19) to illustrate their claims.\n\nAfter Twardowski (1894), it was chiefly Husserl who drew\nphilosophers\u2019 attention to Bolzano with his memorable words\nabout TS (1900 [1970], I: 222),\n\n\na work which, in its treatment of the logical \u2018theory of\nelements\u2019, far surpasses everything that the world-literature\nhas to offer in the way of a systematic sketch of logic. Bolzano did\nnot, of course, expressly discuss or support any independent\ndemarcation of pure logic in our sense, but he provided one de\nfacto in the first two volumes of his work, in his discussion of\nwhat underlay a Wissenschaftslehre or theory of science in\nthe sense of his conception; he did so with such purity and scientific\nstrictness, and with such a rich store of original, scientifically\nconfirmed and ever fruitful thoughts, that we must count him as one of\nthe greatest logicians of all time.\n\n\nNevertheless, he always insisted on the originality of his own\nphenomenological method. Between the two wars, Bolzano\u2019s logic\nand philosophy of mathematics inspired Heinrich Scholz and Jean\nCavaill\u00e8s. Also during this period, Tarski discovered the\nconcept of logical consequence independently of Bolzano, only becoming\naware of the affinity between his work and Bolzano\u2019s after\nScholz (1937 [1961]) pointed it out. However, already in Twardowski\n(1894), the founder of the Polish Lvov-Warsaw school, Bolzano\u2019s\nideas were discussed and criticized at length, and some of them might\nhave become common lore in the Polish school. In 1920, Hans Hahn\nedited the Paradoxes of the infinite with important critical\nnotes, comparing Bolzano with Cantor. Karl Menger might have taken\ninspiration for his theory of dimension not only from Poincar\u00e9,\nbut also from the Paradoxes. Neurath praised Bolzano as one\nof the ancestors of the Vienna Circle, because of the conciseness of\nhis style and the rejection of Kant\u2019s philosophy. Some important\nBolzanian ideas are also found in the work of Quine. All these\ncurrents are indebted to Bolzano for the lesson of intellectual rigour\nand of analytic power. It is Bolzano who is the true founder of the\nkind of analytical philosophy whose core is logic and which is\nimpregnated with science. His logic has archaic aspects, but he\nintroduced not only new concepts, methods and theories, new themes and\nnew problems, but above all a new spirit that has animated philosophy\never since.\n",
