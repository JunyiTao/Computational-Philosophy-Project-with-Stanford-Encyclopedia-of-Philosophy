    "main_text": "Intellectual Background\n2. Intellectual Background\n\nLyotard\u2019s intellectual milieu is one that crossed major events\nin French philosophy and, of course, in global history. His writings\nwould encounter the dominant Marxism of the French political and\nacademic milieu, while also, over a long career, he would debate with\nwriters in existential phenomenology, structuralism, and eventually\npost-structuralism, the latter being the moniker under which his works\nare commonly placed. Lyotard\u2019s first book,\nPhenomenology (1954), demonstrated the import of that\nmovement on his early thought. Husserlian phenomenology, by way of\nJean-Paul Sartre (1905\u20131980) and Maurice Merleau-Ponty\n(1908\u20131961), was dominant in the era\u2019s existentialist\nmovements, and Lyotard\u2019s work attempts to find a place for\nphenomenology in light of the Marxism dominant on the left, especially\nin the human sciences (e.g., sociology, history, and linguistics).\nLike Sartre, who attempted to wed his existentialist emphasis on the\nirreducibility of subjective experience and Marxian analyses, which\nled to his Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960), Lyotard\nwanted to understand if there was a way to take up the era\u2019s\ndominant phenomenological bent in French philosophy in terms of the\nLeft\u2019s adherence to Marxian analyses. Ultimately, he argues for\nphenomenology\u2019s place to speak to experiences beyond what is\narticulable in language, while also following its founder, Edmund\nHusserl (1859\u20131938), in arguing that it could provide the\nsciences with their grounding in the essence of their areas of study:\nwhat is the meaning of history for the historical sciences? What is\nthe social for the sociologist? For Lyotard, these questions cannot be\nanswered from within these sciences themselves.\n\nUnlike Sartre, Lyotard does not seek a dialectical fusion of freedom,\nas found in existentialism, and necessity, as found in the objective\nlaws found in the various sciences. Rather he seeks a \u201cthird\nway\u201d of thinking of history that shows how ultimately\nphenomenology cannot speak to the movements of history found in\nMarxism, but he also rejects any incipient structuralism of the period\nthat would denude the human of its place in history\n(Phenomenology, 131). For structuralism, as it would come to\ndefine itself over the next fifteen years in works by Lacan and Claude\nLevi-Strauss (1908\u20132009), among others, the human subject is\nlargely the effect of discursive grammars in which it is\nproduced. But most importantly for his later work, Lyotard argues that\nphenomenology offers a way not to think a single key to history, some\none meaning to which it must answer, but rather stipulates that\nhistory, for phenomenology, has \u201csome meaning\u201d\n(Phenomenology, 131, his emphasis).\n\nNevertheless, Lyotard judged phenomenology to be ultimately\nreactionary, unable to respond to the ways in which the economic\nrelations of production produce given conscious states, that is, how\nsubjectivity is founded in objectivity. In this way,\nLyotard\u2019s work for the next decade would look to identify and\nillustrate these relations of production, especially in the Algerian\nsituation, but time and again he chafed against Marxism\u2019s cookie\ncutter approach, which denied cultural differences as epiphenomenal to\nthe same economic forces it would find everywhere. The events of\nMay 1968\u2014and the vibrant intellectual period of France during\nthe whole of the late 1960s\u2014would have an indelible impact on\nLyotard\u2019s work. Marxism failed, he believed, to account for the\nalliance of bourgeois students and workers together demanding\nliberation, while the French Communist Party\u2019s siding with\nCharles de Gaulle\u2019s government in helping bring the May 1968\nevents to an end scandalized many on the left. Marxism, Lyotard\nbelieved, failed to account for the desire that pushed those very\nstudents into the streets in the first place. Structuralism, for its\npart, Lyotard averred, was ultimately too intellectualist to account\nfor the sensuous and figural gestures that were very much a part of\nthe anarchical May 1968 events. As marchers argued against their\nstructuralist professors that structures don\u2019t take to the\nstreets, Lyotard came to emphasize the figural and aesthetic\ndimensions of human existence\u2014going against what he believed was\nstructuralism\u2019s adherence to intellectual discourse over the\nlibidinal, extra-linguistic and sensuous experience. This would result\nin Discourse, Figure (1971). This put him at odds with the\ndominant structuralist and post-structuralist emphasis on language,\nand as the 1970s began and disappointment set in that May 1968 gave\nrise to little in terms of substantive change, Lyotard, like others,\nlooked to aesthetics and sensuous relations for their revolutionary\npotential. This led him to his strongest denunciation of Marxism yet\nin Libidinal Economy (1973). As the 1970s progressed and\nFrance moved from one technocratic government to the next, Lyotard\nbegan to elaborate a critique of technoscience and its reductionist\naccount of existence in terms that also reflected\npost-structuralism\u2019s attunement to difference. Ultimately, as he\nargued in such works as The Postmodern Condition (1979),\nJust Gaming (1979), and The Differend (1983), the\ntask\u2014in light of the loss of modernity\u2019s metanarratives\u2014was \nto account for the \u201cdifferends\u201d among different language\ngames, that is, irreducible ways in which peoples operating within\ndifferent milieu don\u2019t have access to some all-encompassing\norder in which to have discussions over what is just, true, and so\nforth. This emphasis on language games, derived from Ludwig\nWittgenstein\u2019s (1889\u20131951) later work, but also influenced\nby such figures as Saul Kripke (1940\u2013 ), brought him within the\nlinguistic turn that he had earlier found to be a linguistic idealism.\nLyotard\u2019s writings, then, were always on the move and it would\nbe difficult to form a metanarrative or passkey that brings them all\nunder a common point of view or set of concerns. Nevertheless, while\nhe remained a man of his time\u2014always responding and making\nadvances in the dominant schools of French thought through which he\nlived\u2014his work continues to speak to those influenced by those\nfields, as well as new movements in Continental realisms, aesthetics,\nand posthumanism.\n",
