    "main_text": "Varieties of Empiricism || Explanatory Empiricism\n2.1 Explanatory Empiricism\n\nThe first is what I shall call explanatory empiricism, which\ndenies the validity of inferences from observable phenomena to causes\nthat cannot themselves be observed. Perhaps the best known modern\nexample is the empiricism of the physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach\n(1838\u20131916). At least for most of his life, Mach rejected the\ntheory of atoms as an example of \u201chypothetico-fictive\nphysics\u201d (Mach 1992: 136) and would respond to believers in\natoms with the words, Habn S\u2019eins gsehn? (Have you seen\none?) (Meyer 1992: 151). (For a slightly different view of\nMach\u2019s atomism, see Banks 2003: 12\u201314.) A more recent\nexample is the \u201cconstructive empiricism\u201d of Bas van\nFraassen, which holds that the aim of science is to produce theories\nthat are empirically adequate, a theory being empirically adequate if\n\u201cwhat it says about the observable things and events in this\nworld, is true\u201d (van Fraassen 1980: 12). This view also rules\nout inferences to unobservable entities (van Fraassen 1980: 72). While\nthis may sound like a modern position, it was held by the first people\nto call themselves \u201cempiricists,\u201d namely a group of\nancient medical writers, who rejected inferences to what is \u201cnot\nevident\u201d in favour of the recording of correlations between\ntypes of observable events\n (sect. 3.3.1).\n",
