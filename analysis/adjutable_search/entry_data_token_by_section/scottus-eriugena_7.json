    "main_text": "Eriugena\u2019s Sources || Maximus Confessor\n2.2 Maximus Confessor\n\nAlthough he has recourse to Maximus Confessor hoping that he might offer some\nclarifications for understanding Pseudo-Dionysius, Maximus will offer\nEriugena much more: a trove of ideas, methods, and philosophical\nvocabulary. Thus, Maximus allows him to expand and clarify the\ninsights received from Dionysius and provides him with an eclectic\nphilosophical and theological vocabulary: the Maximian oeuvre offers a\npalimpsest of Neo-Aristotelian and Neoplatonic philosophical terms and\nconcepts along with a rich theological vocabulary which is mostly a\nsynthesis of terms and concepts derived from Pseudo-Dionysius and the\nCappadocian Fathers (Gregory Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Basil\nthe Great).\n\nThe very method of the Periphyseon, which employs natural\nphilosophy and exegesis of the Bible interchangeably, in order to contemplate and\n\u201cread\u201d the two \u201cbooks\u201d (creation and\nScripture) in which the divine signs (theophanies) are manifested, can be\ntraced back to Maximus\u2019  notion of knowledge as contemplation of\nnature (theoria physik\u00e8). If contemplated and read\nfrom the right perspective, scripture and creation become transparent\nto divine presence.\n\nEriugena adopts the cosmological framework of Maximus\u2019 \nChristian Neoplatonism: the cosmic movement of exitus becomes\nthe incarnation, the mystery of Christ becoming man; reditus,\nthe return of all beings to their source, coincides with deification,\nhumans ascending to God through deification\n(\u03b8\u03ad\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2). Eriugena will go\nfurther and correlate these cosmic movements with the two main\noperations of dialectic: division and analysis; this allows him to\nconstruct a deep correspondence between epistemology and ontology.\nThus, Maximus\u2019  cosmic Christology based on the Logos-logoi ontology, offers Eriugena a framework\nwhich allows him to expand the use of dialectic from mere method \nto a cosmic framework which underlies both epistemology and\nontology.\n\nMaximus\u2019 understanding of the incarnation as a cosmic event\ninforms Eriugena\u2019s ontology and his notion of theophanic\ncreation; although the notion of theophany is first derived from\nDionysius, it is enhanced through Maximus\u2019 understanding of the\nincarnation of Christ as a cosmic mediation and unification of all\naspects and levels of reality. Through the ideas of Pseudo-Dionysius\nand Maximus, Eriugena overcomes the distrust of visible and material\nnature found in Neoplatonism; rather he believes contemplating the theophanies encountered in nature (which has been redeemed through the incarnation of the Logos) is necessary for the return of creation to its divine source.\n\nEriugena\u2019s anthropology is based on Maximus\u2019 insight that\nthe human being is a synthesis of all aspects of creation, as he says,\nthe \u201cworkshop of creation\u201c (officina omnium) and as such plays\na crucial role in unifying creation through proper knowledge; the\nentire dialogue of the Periphyseon could be seen as a\nspiritual exercise (exercitatio animi) of training through\nthe liberal arts in order to attain the level of intellectual\nknowledge; the goal of exercitatio is to contemplate nature\nin the right way in order to repair the fragmentation of creation by\nachieving a unified vision and thus realize the return of all things\nto their divine source. The human being as officina omnium\nplays a central role in the process of return (reditus) because as a primordial idea in the divine mind,\nit can mediate between the primordial causes and the created effects.\nHowever, only through the incarnation (in which Christ assumes human\nnature in its totality), can the full, cosmic scope of this process of mediation and unification through the human being as officina omnium be realized: through the incarnation of Christ the Logos, the universal human nature and through it the\nrest of creation is unified, redeemed and ultimately divinized.
