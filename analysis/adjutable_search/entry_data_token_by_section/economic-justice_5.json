    "main_text": "Inequality and Poverty Measurement || The Dominance Approach\n2.2 The Dominance Approach\n\nThe multiplicity of indices, even when a restriction to special\nsub-classes may be justified by axiomatic characterization, raises a\nserious problem for applications. How can one make sure that a\ndistribution is more or less unequal, or has more or less poverty,\nthan another without checking an infinite number of indices? Although\nthis may look like a purely practical issue, it has given rise to a\nbroad range of deep results, relating the statistical concept of\nstochastic dominance to general properties of social welfare functions\nand to the satisfaction of transfer axioms by inequality and poverty\nindices. This approach, in particular, justifies the widespread use of\nLorenz curves in the empirical studies of inequality. The Lorenz curve\ndepicts the percentage of the total amount of whatever is measured,\nincome, wealth or well-being, possessed by any given percentage of the\npoorest among the population. For instance, according to the Census\nBureau, in 2006 the poorest 20%\u2019s share of total income was\n3.7%, the poorest 40%\u2019s share was 13.1%, the poorest 60%\u2019s\nshare was 28.1%, the poorest 80%\u2019s share was 50.6%, while the\ntop 5%\u2019s share was 22.2%. This indicates that the Lorenz curve\nis approximately as in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\nConsiderable progress has been made in the development of dominance\ntechniques of the Lorenz type, with extensions to multidimensional\ninequality and to poverty measurement (Aaberge and Brandolini\n2015).\n",
