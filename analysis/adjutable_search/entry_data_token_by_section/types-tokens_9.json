The Relation between Types and their Tokens\n\n\nThe relation between types and their tokens is obviously dependent on\nwhat a type is. If it is a set, as Quine (1987, p. 217) maintains, the\nrelation is class membership. If it is a kind, as\nWolterstorff maintains, the relation is kind-membership. If\nit is a law, as Peirce maintains, it is something else again, perhaps\nbeing used in accordance with. (Although Peirce also says a\ntoken is an \u201cinstance\u201d of a type and that the token\nsignifies the type.) Nonetheless, it has often been taken to be the\nrelation of instantiation, or exemplification; a token is an\ninstance of a type; it exemplifies the type. (Not that every instance\nof a type is a token\u2014e.g. capital \u2018A\u2019, small\n\u2018A\u2019, and all the other types of \u2018A\u2019s tokened\nin the display in \u00a74.2 above may be said to be instances of the\nletter \u2018A\u2019.) As with other universals, there are two\nversions of this relation, Platonic and Aristotelian. Although the two\nversions of property realism are discussed at length under this\nencyclopedia's entry for properties, a few remarks about the type\nversions are in order.\n\n\nAccording to Platonic versions of type realism, e.g., Bromberger 1989,\nHale 1990, Katz 1981 and Wetzel 2002, the type is an abstract object,\nnot located anywhere in space-time, although its tokens are.  This\nversion appears to give rise to serious epistemological\nproblems\u2014we don't see or hear the type, it isn't located\nanywhere in space-time, so how do spatiotemporal creatures such as\nourselves know it exists, or what properties it has? Admittedly, we\nsee and hear tokens, but how are they a guide to what the type is\nlike? One answer, given for example, by Wolterstorff, for whom we saw\nin \u00a74 that a type is a norm-kind, is that ordinary induction from\ntokens would give us knowledge of types, at least in the case of\ninstantiated types.  Bromberger (1992a, p.176) claims that linguists\n\u201coften impute properties to types after observing and judging\nsome of their tokens and seem to do this in a principled way\u201d\nand calls the principle that licenses this inference the Platonic\nRelationship Principle. More specifically, he proposes (1992a)\nthat the type, as the archetype of the quasi-natural kind which\ncomprises the tokens, has just those projectible properties that all\nthe tokens have. He has in mind properties such as the same underlying\nphonological structure, for words, and the same boiling point, for\nelements.\n\n\nHowever, as we saw in \u00a74, generally there are no such properties\nhad by all and only tokens of a type, at least in the case of\nwords\u2014not same phonological structure, nor same sense nor same\nspelling. Not all tokens have any such natural projectible property\n(except for the property of being tokens of the same\ntype). It should be clear from \u00a74 that the cookie cutter\nmodel\u2014the idea of the type as just a perceptible pattern for\nwhat all the tokens look like\u2014does not work.  Goodman (1972,\npp. 437-8) follows Peirce in using the word \u2018replica\u2019 to\napply to all tokens of the same type, (although Peirce seemed to think\nthey were replicas of the type, whereas Goodman, being a nominalist,\ncannot think this) but not all tokens resemble each other in any\nordinary sense beyond being tokens of the same type (although of\ncourse some do). Goodman himself is clear about this, for he notes\nthere that \u201cSimilarity, ever ready to solve philosophical\nproblems and overcome obstacles, is a pretender, an impostor, a\nquack\u2026. Similarity does not pick out inscriptions that are\n\u2018tokens of a common type\u2019, or replicas of each other. Only\nour addiction to similarity deludes us into accepting similarity as\nthe basis for grouping inscriptions into the several letters, words,\nand so forth.\u201d But others, e.g. Stebbing (1935, p. 6) and Hardie\n(1936), claim that all spoken tokens are more or less similar to each\nother. Because they are not, Wetzel (2002) and (2008) proposes that\nsince the only property all the tokens of a type generally share is\nbeing tokens of the type, one of the primary justifications for\npositing word types is that being a token of the word\n\u2018color,\u2019 say, is the glue that binds the considerable\nvariety of space-time particulars together. The type is thus a very\nimportant theoretical object, whose function is to unify all the\ntokens as being \u201cof the same type\u201d; in accordance with the\nPlatonic Relationship Principle, the type has properties based on the\nproperties of some of its tokens, but in a complex\nway\u2014in addition, the tokens have some of their\nproperties in virtue of what properties the type has.\n\n\nIn Aristotelian versions of exemplification, such as Wollheim 1968 and\nArmstrong 1978, the type has no independent existence apart from its\ntokens. It is \u201cin\u201d each and every one of its tokens, and\nso can be seen or heard just as the tokens can be. This avoids the\nepistemological problem mentioned in the preceding paragraph, but\nmakes it hard to explain how some types\u2014such as very long\nsentences\u2014can have no tokens.\n\n\nAs against instantiation of any sort, Stebbing (1935, p. 9) argues\nthat a token is not an instance of a type, because \u201cthe type is\na logical construction out of tokens having similarity or conventional\nassociation [as the inscribed word with the spoken]. It follows that\nthe type is logically dependent upon the tokens, in the sense that it\nis logically impossible to mention the type-word without using a\ntoken, and further, the meaning of the type has to be defined by\nreference to the tokens.\u201d These claims are quite\ncontroversial. For example, it is clear one can refer to a type word\nwithout using a token of it\u2014one can say \u201cthe word\na token of which is the first word on the page\u201d.\n\n\nAnother alternative to exemplification is\nrepresentation. According to Szabo (1999, p. 150), types are\nabstract particulars, as with Platonic realism, but tokens\nrepresent their types, just as \u201cpaintings, photographs,\nmaps, numerals, hand gestures, traffic signs and horn signals\u201d\nrepresent, or \u201cstand for\u201d their representata. A word token\nof \u2018horse\u2019 represents the word \u2018horse\u2019, which\nin turn represents horses. Just as a correct map of the planet can\nprovide us with knowledge of the planet, so too a token can provide us\nwith knowledge of properties of the type, thus addressing the\nepistemological problem. The representation view gives rise to a\nproblem however, for it turns out that what we have been calling word\ntokens aren't words at all on this view, anymore than a map of a\nplanet is a planet, and this runs contrary to our usual thinking.\n",
