Eight Ways of Dealing with the Repugnant Conclusion\n\nSeveral philosophers have taken up the challenge from Parfit and have\nengaged in considerations as to what would constitute a satisfactory\npopulation ethics. Some theorists have done so by accepting the\nframework Parfit has set for the investigation; that is, they have\ncarried on the work of developing an ethical theory that succeeds in\nmeeting Parfit\u2019s minimal requirements for adequacy. Other\ntheorists have been less willing to accept the scenery as set by\nParfit and have more or less radically challenged his requirements for\na plausible theory. The Repugnant Conclusion has been placed at the\ncentre of this discussion. The suggestions in the literature on how to\ndeal with the Repugnant Conclusion can roughly be divided into eight\ncategories: (1) introducing new ways of aggregating welfare into a\nmeasure of value; (2) questioning the way we can compare and measure\nwelfare; (3) counting welfare differently depending on temporal or\nmodal features; (4) revising the notion of a life worth living; (5)\nrejecting transitivity; (6) appeal to other values; (7) accepting the\nimpossibility of a satisfactory population ethics; (8) accepting the\nRepugnant Conclusion.\n",
