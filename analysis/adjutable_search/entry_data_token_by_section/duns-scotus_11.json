    "main_text": "Ethics and Moral Psychology || The natural law\n5.1 The natural law\n\nFor Scotus the natural law in the strict sense contains only those\nmoral propositions that are per se notae ex terminis along\nwith whatever propositions can be derived from them deductively\n(Ordinatio 3, d. 37, q. un.). Per se notae means\nthat they are self-evident; ex terminis adds that they are\nself-evident in virtue of being analytically true. Now one important\nfact about propositions that are self-evident and analytically true is\nthat God himself can\u2019t make them false. They are necessary\ntruths. So the natural law in the strict sense does not depend on\nGod\u2019s will. This means that even if (as I believe) Scotus is\nsome sort of divine-command theorist, he is not whole-hog in his\ndivine command theory. Some moral truths are necessary truths, and\neven God can\u2019t change those. They would be true no matter what\nGod willed.\n\nWhich ones are those? Scotus\u2019s basic answer is that they are the\ncommandments of the first tablet of the Decalogue (Ten Commandments).\nThe Decalogue has often been thought of as involving two tablets. The\nfirst covers our obligations to God and consists of the first three\ncommandments: You shall have no other gods before me, You\nshall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, and\nRemember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. (Note that many\nProtestants divide them up differently.) The second tablet spells out\nour obligations toward others: Honor your father and mother,\nYou shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery,\nYou shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness\nagainst your neighbor, and two commandments against coveting. The\ncommandments of the first tablet are part of the natural law in the\nstrict sense because they have to do with God himself, and with the\nway in which God is to be treated. For Scotus says that the following\nproposition is per se nota ex terminis: \u201cIf God exists,\nthen he is to be loved as God, and nothing else is to be worshiped as\nGod, and no irreverence is to be done to him.\u201d Given the very\ndefinition of God, it follows that if there is such a being, he is to\nbe loved and worshiped, and no irreverence should be shown to him.\nBecause these commandments are self-evident and analytic, they are\nnecessary truths. Not even God himself could make them false.\n\nBut even the first three commandments, once we start looking at them,\nare not obviously part of the natural law in the strict sense. In\nparticular, the third commandment, the one about the Sabbath day, is a\nlittle tricky. Obviously, the proposition \u201cGod is to be\nworshiped on Saturday\u201d is not self-evident or analytic. In fact,\nScotus says it\u2019s not even true any more, since Christians are to\nworship on Sunday, not Saturday. So, Scotus asks, what about the\nproposition \u201cGod is to be worshiped at some time or\nother\u201d? Even that is not self-evident or analytic. The best one\ncan do is \u201cGod is not to be hated.\u201d Now that\u2019s\nself-evident and analytic, since by definition God is the being most\nworthy of love and there is nothing in him worthy of hate. But\nobviously that\u2019s far weaker than any positive commandment about\nwhether and when we should worship God.\n\nSo by the time Scotus completes his analysis, we are left with nothing\nin the natural law in the strict sense except for negative\npropositions: God is not to be hated, no other gods are to be\nworshiped, no irreverence is to be done to God. Everything else in the\nDecalogue belongs to the natural law in a weaker or looser sense.\nThese are propositions that are not per se notae ex terminis\nand do not follow from such propositions, but are \u201chighly\nconsonant\u201d with such propositions. Now the important point for\nScotus is this: since these propositions are contingent, they are\ncompletely up to God\u2019s discretion. Any contingent truth\nwhatsoever depends on God\u2019s will.\n\nAccording to Scotus, God of course is aware of all contingent\npropositions. Now God gets to assign the truth values to those\npropositions. For example, \u201cUnicorns exist\u201d is a\ncontingent proposition. Therefore, it is up to God\u2019s will\nwhether that proposition will be true or false. The same goes for\ncontingent moral propositions. Take any such proposition and call it\nL, and call the opposite of L, not-L. Both\nL and not-L are contingent propositions. God can\nmake either of them true, but he can\u2019t make both of them true,\nsince they are contradictories. Suppose that God wills L.\nL is now part of the moral law. How do we explain why God\nwilled L rather than not-L? Scotus says we\ncan\u2019t. God\u2019s will with respect to contingent propositions\nis unqualifiedly free. So while there might be some reasons why God\nchose the laws he chose, there is no fully adequate reason, no total\nexplanation. If there were a total explanation other than God\u2019s\nwill itself, those propositions wouldn\u2019t be contingent at all.\nThey would be necessary. So at bottom there is simply the sheer fact\nthat God willed one law rather than another.\n\nScotus intends this claim to be exactly parallel to the way we think\nabout contingent beings. Why are there elephants but no unicorns? As\neveryone would agree, it\u2019s because God willed for there to be\nelephants but no unicorns. And why did he will that? He just did.\nThat\u2019s part of what we mean by saying that God was free in\ncreating. There was nothing constraining him or forcing him to create\none thing rather than another. The same is true about the moral law.\nWhy is there an obligation to honor one\u2019s parents but no such\nobligation toward cousins? Because God willed that there be an\nobligation to honor one\u2019s parents, and he did not will that\nthere be any such obligation toward one\u2019s cousins. He could have\nwilled both of these obligations, and he could have willed neither.\nWhat explains the way that he did in fact will? Nothing whatsoever\nexcept the sheer fact that he did will that way.\n\n(For recent criticisms of this strongly voluntaristic reading of\nScotus\u2019s account of the moral law, see Borland and Hillman 2017\nand Ward 2019.)\n",
