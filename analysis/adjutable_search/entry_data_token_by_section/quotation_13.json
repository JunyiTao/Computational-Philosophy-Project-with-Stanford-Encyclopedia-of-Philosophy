    "main_text": "Mixed Quotation\n4. Mixed Quotation\n\nFrom around the millennium, beginning with Cappelen and Lepore\u2019s\n1997a, which made the topic mainstream, mixed quotation has been,\narguably, the area in which theorizing about quotation has advanced\nthe most. The problem has attracted the attention of both philosophers\nand linguists, and our understanding of both the data to be accounted\nfor, and the various possibilities for doing so, has been greatly\nimproved.\n\nIt\u2019s important to reiterate our above note that here as\nelsewhere in the theory of quotation what comprises the phenomenon is\nup for debate; different theorists emphasise or play down different\nbits of data. What follows, accordingly, doesn\u2019t represent a\nconsensus position on the problem, simply because there isn\u2019t\none (indeed, somewhat unfortunately, there isn\u2019t even consensus\nabout the terminology, some calling it \u2018hybrid\u2019 or\n\u2018impure\u2019, and some subsuming mixed quotation under\n\u2018scare quoting\u2019; De Brabanter 2010 is helpful here, as\nwell as being a useful survey of the field from a linguist\u2019s\npoint of view). We will simply present some of the more interesting\nand central data points and problems for a theory of mixed quotation\n(for the theories themselves, we refer the reader to Maier\u2019s\n(2020) overview article which presents some of the main formal\nsemantic theories out there. For recent theories by philosophers on\nmixed quotation, see Gomez-Torrente 2005, Kirk and Ludwig 2017,\nMcCullagh 2007, 2017. The main linguists to consult are cited in this\nsection.)\n\nThe paradigm example of mixed quotation is the following,\nrepeated:\n\n(12)\nQuine said that quotation \u2018has a certain anomalous\nfeature\u2019.\n\n\nIt is mostly agreed that this sentence puts forward the following\nclaim: Quine said (expressed the proposition or content) that\nquotation has an anomalous feature, and did so by uttering the\nexpression \u2018has an anomalous feature\u2019. This suggests two\ninitial requirements:\n\nAn adequate theory of mixed quotation must account for the fact\nthat the quoted material is used by the reporter to characterise the\nproposition that the reportee expressed.\nIt must also account for the fact that the quoted material was\nuttered by the reportee.\n\n\nLet\u2019s call these the use requirement and the\nmention requirement, respectively.\n\nWhile these both seem clearly on the right lines (if you doubt this,\nopen or scroll to a newspaper and read until you find the first mixed\nquotation (it shouldn\u2019t take long) and see if the requirements\nare operative) there are problems with both of them. It might\ninitially seem that the mention requirement requires that the reportee\nhave uttered verbatim the words ascribed to him or her. That would\naccount for the anomalousness of:\n\n(38)\n# Quine said quotation \u2018has a certain anomalous\nfeature\u2019, although he didn\u2019t use the words \u2018has a\ncertain anomalous feature\u2019.\n\n\nThings aren\u2019t so clear, though. Certain other pieces of data are\nin tension with this purported feature of the mention requirement,\nmost notably that one can mixed quote someone correctly in a language\nother than the one they spoke (Cappelen and Lepore 2007 p. 44). Thus\nthe following, as well as its parenthesised continuation, is fine:\n\n(39)\nKant said that concepts without intuition \u2018are empty\u2019,\n(although he didn\u2019t use those words: he said \u2018sind\nleer\u2019).\n\n\nMoreover, more subtle problems for the use requirement come from\ninflected languages (Shan 2010, Maier 2014a). Thus in Italian, nouns\nmust agree in gender and number with adjectives. Imagine Ken says:\n\n(40)\nGli uomini italiani mi sembrano molto carini.\n\n\nThis means \u2018I find Italian men very cute\u2019, and since the\nnoun \u2018uomini\u2019 (men) is m.pl, so is the adjective\n\u2018carini\u2019 (cute). But if one wanted to mixed quote Ken,\nusing a different word than \u2018uomini\u2019, that different word\nwould have to agree:\n\n(41)\nKen ha detto che le persone italiane \u2018mi sembrano molto\ncarine\u2019\n\n\nSo the mixed quoted material used to report Ken\u2019s utterance is\nnot what he said verbatim: he said \u2018carini\u2019 and he is\nreported as saying \u2018carine\u2019 (the example is from Shan\n2010). Maier presents similar cases for Dutch. Yet a third problem\ncomes from the fact that one can \u2018clean up\u2019 quotations, by\nremoving grammatical slurs, umms and ahhs, and so on (see Cappelen and\nLepore 2007 p. 45).\n\nWhat exactly the mention requirement requires is uncertain, then. But\nnor, however, is the use requirement without its problems. There are\nat least two, which again differ in subtlety. From the beginning,\nit\u2019s been realised that indexicals in mixed quotations cause\nintriguing problems. Consider:\n\n(42)\nMr. Greenspan said he agreed with Labor Secretary R. B. Reich\n\u2018on quite a lot of things\u2019. Their accord on this issue, he\nsaid, has proved \u2018quite a surprise to both of us\u2019.\n(Cappelen and Lepore 1997b, p. 429)\n\n\nIf the second mixed quotation were simply being used, then the second\nsentence should be true provided accord was a surprise to the people\nwriting the report, not to Greenspan and Reich. That\u2019s clearly\nthe wrong result, and shows that the use requirement needs some\nmodifiction (for discussion about indexicals in mixed quotation, and\nwhether they call for Kaplanian monstrous operators, see also Recanati\n(2001), Cumming (2003), Geurts and Maier (2003), and Maier\n(2016)).\n\nThe behaviour of indexicals in mixed quotation is important, because\nit gives strong evidence against the possibility that mixed quotation\nis a pragmatic phenomenon. A typical pragmatic analysis would say that\nthe semantic contribution of the quoted material in a mixed quotation\nis just its unquoted semantic value (so that the literal semantic\ncontent of (12) is simply \u2018Quine said that quotation has a\ncertain anomalous feature\u2019), but that to utter a mixed quotation\nis to imply, but not to say, that the quoted material was used by the\nspeaker to say what they said.\n\nThe advantages of a pragmatic analysis of mixed quotation are those\ntypical of pragmatic analyses in general: no extra semantic machinery\nis required to account for the problem cases. As such, versions of\nsuch an analysis have had many adherents at the end of the twentieth\ncentury (see, for example, Recanati (2001), Clark & Gerrig (1990),\nWilson (2000), Sperber & Wilson (1981), Tsohatzidis (1998),\nStaintion (1999), Saka (2003) and the discussion in by Reimer\n(2003)).\n\nHowever, the behaviour of indexicals in mixed quotation make the\npragmatic analysis harder to uphold. One needs to say that (42) is\nliterally false, and while that is a move that can be made, it\u2019s\nnot particularly attractive. Accordingly, the pragmatic analysis has\ngone somewhat out of fashion, and has been argued against explicitly\nexplicitly by Gomez-Torrente (2017), and implicitly by most of the\nlinguists working in the field, for whom the behaviour of indexicals\nis a key explanandum of a theory of mixed quotation, and not something\nto be explained away (although see De Brabanter 2019 for a\npragmatic theory of indexicals in mixed quotation).\n\nThe second, more subtle, problem is a consequence of the fact that one\ncan mixed quote an expression belonging to a dialect other than the\none one speaks, or even to no dialect at all (Shan 2010). Thus even in\ninformal British English, \u2018accident\u2019 always takes the\npreposition \u2018by\u2019 and never \u2018on\u2019. A British\nspeaker can draw attention to this fact, by uttering, about an\nAmerican friend of theirs:\n\n(43)\nMeagan said she took out the trash \u2018on accident\u2019.\n\n\nBut a British speaker can\u2019t felicitiously use \u2018on\naccident\u2019 because that\u2019s not a part of British English\nspeakers\u2019 dialect. Similarly, \u2018misunderestimated\u2019\nisn\u2019t a word in most anybody\u2019s dialects, but we can\nsay:\n\n(44)\nBush said that his opponents \u2018misunderestimated\u2019\nhim.\n\n\nA different, more fundamental, source of complication arises from the\nfact that it\u2019s unclear exactly how much to include under mixed\nquotation. Thus consider:\n\n(45)\nQuine wrote a couple of papers on quotation, the \u2018anomalous\nfeature\u2019 of which he thought about a lot.\n(46)\nA: The Godfather II is a total snooze.\n\nB: Well, Pauline Kael said this \u2018total snooze\u2019 is a\ndefining moment in American cinema. (Potts 2007, p 420)\n\n\nShould we include such phenomena in our theory of mixed quotation? The\nfirst sentence doesn\u2019t contain a speech verb, while the second\ndoes, but the person to whom the mixed quotation is attributed\nisn\u2019t the person who uttered the mixed quoted words. It\u2019s\nunclear. Things get even more uncertain when we consider scare quotes\n(Predelli 2003a,b, Saka 2013, Gomez-Torrente 2017) and what are known\neuphemistically as grocers\u2019 quotes:\n\n(47)\nTeens are spending more and more time \u2018sexting\u2019,\nsomething of concern to parents and even technology companies.\n(48)\n[written on a desiccate in a new pair of shoes] Do not\n\u2018eat\u2019!\n\n\nIn the former case, there isn\u2019t any one person who used\n\u2018sexting\u2019; rather, the writer is marking that it\u2019s\nused in a community which they are not part of or disapprove of. In\nthe latter case, the quotation marks are serving as emphasis. While we\nprobably don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time seriously theorizing\nabout grocers\u2019 quotes (although see Abbott 2003), whether or not\nscare quotes should be treated as we treat mixed quotation (indeed,\nwhether or not they\u2019re one and the same) is an open question\n(see McCullagh 2017 for discussion and an affirmative answer to these\nquestions; Gomez-Torrente 2017 demurs).\n\nThis isn\u2019t even an exhaustive characterization. Thus it\u2019s\nimportant to attend to cognate phenomena like dequotation (Shan 2010)\nand free indirect discourse (Maier 2015, 2017). And the theorist of\nmixed quotation should at least be aware of the problem of mixed\nquoting non-constituent clauses (Abbott 2003, De Brabanter 2022), and\nthe possibility that one can mixed quote without quotation marks (De\nBrabanter 2010). The complexity of the data has inspired much\ninteresting theorizing, and we expect that mixed quotation will\ncontinue to be a focal question in the theory of quotation.\n",
