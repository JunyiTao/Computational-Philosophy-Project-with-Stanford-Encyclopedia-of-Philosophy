    "main_text": "Ethical Thought and Value Pluralism || Berlin\u2019s Definition of Value Pluralism\n4.1 Berlin\u2019s Definition of Value Pluralism\n\nBerlin\u2019s development and definition of pluralism both began\nnegatively, with the identification of the opposing position, which he\nusually referred to as \u2018monism\u2019, and sometimes as\n\u2018the Ionian fallacy\u2019 or \u2018the Platonic ideal\u2019.\nHis definition of monism may be summarised as follows:\n\nAll genuine questions must have one true answer, and one only; all\nother responses are errors.\nThere must be a dependable path to discovering the true answer to\na question, which is in principle knowable, even if currently\nunknown.\nThe true answers, when found, will be compatible with one another,\nforming a single whole; for one truth cannot be incompatible with\nanother. (This, in turn, is based on the assumption that the universe\nis harmonious and coherent.)\n\n\nWe have seen that Berlin denied that the first two of these\nassumptions are true. In his ethical pluralism he pushed these denials\nfurther, and added a forceful denial of the third assumption.\nAccording to Berlin\u2019s pluralism, genuine values are many. They\nmay \u2013 and often do \u2013 come into conflict with one another.\nWhen two or more values clash, it is not because one or another has\nbeen misunderstood; nor can it be said, a priori, that any one value\nis always more important than another. Liberty can conflict with\nequality or with public order; mercy with justice; love with\nimpartiality and fairness; social and moral commitment with the\ndisinterested pursuit of truth or beauty (the latter two values,\ncontra Keats, may themselves be incompatible); knowledge with\nhappiness; spontaneity and free-spiritedness with dependability and\nresponsibility. Conflicts of values are \u2018an intrinsic,\nirremovable element in human life\u2019; \u2018the notion of total\nhuman fulfilment is a [\u2026] chimera\u2019. \u2018These\ncollisions of values are of the essence of what they are and what we\nare\u2019; a world in which such conflicts are resolved is not the\nworld we know or understand (2002b, 213; 1990, 13).\n\nBerlin further asserted that values may be not only incompatible, but\nincommensurable. There has been considerable controversy over what he\nmeant by this, and whether his understanding of incommensurability was\neither correct or coherent. In speaking of the incommensurability of\nvalues, Berlin seems to have meant that there is no common measure, no\n\u2018common currency\u2019 in terms of which the relative\nimportance of any two values can be established in the abstract. Thus\none basic implication of pluralism for ethics is the view that a\nquantitative approach to ethical questions (such as that envisaged by\nUtilitarianism) is impossible. In addition to denying the existence of\na common currency for comparison, or a governing principle (such as\nthe utility principle), value incommensurability holds that there is\nno general procedure for resolving value conflicts \u2013 there is\nnot, for example, a lexical priority rule (that is, no value always\nhas priority over another).\n\nBerlin based these assertions on empirical grounds \u2013 on\n\u2018the world that we encounter in ordinary experience\u2019, in\nwhich \u2018we are faced with choices between ends equally ultimate,\nand claims equally\n absolute,[16]\n the realisation of some of which must inevitably involve the\nsacrifice of others\u2019 (2002b, 213\u201314). Yet he also held\nthat the doctrine of pluralism reflected logically necessary rather\nthan contingent truths about the nature of human moral life and the\nvalues that are its ingredients. The idea of a perfect whole or\nultimate solution is not only unattainable in practice, but also\nconceptually incoherent. To avert or overcome conflicts between values\nonce and for all would require the transformation, which amounted to\nthe abandonment, of those values themselves. It is not clear that this\nlogical point adds anything significant to the empirical point about\nhuman ends recorded in the last quotation, but we do not pursue this\ndoubt here.\n\nBerlin\u2019s pluralism was not free-standing: it was modified and\nguided by other beliefs and commitments. One of these, discussed\nbelow, was liberalism. Another was humanism \u2013 the view that\nhuman beings are of primary importance, and that avoiding harm to\nhuman beings is the first moral priority (Aarsbergen-Ligtvoet 2006;\nCherniss and Hardy 2018). Berlin therefore held that, in navigating\nbetween conflicting values, \u2018The first public obligation is to\navoid extremes of suffering.\u2019 He insisted that moral collisions,\neven if unavoidable, can be softened, claims balanced, compromises\nreached. The goal should be the maintenance of a \u2018precarious\nequilibrium\u2019 that avoids, as far as possible, \u2018desperate\nsituations\u2019 and \u2018intolerable choices\u2019. Philosophy\nitself cannot tell us how to do this, though it can help by bringing\nto light the problem of moral conflict and all of its implications,\nand by weeding out false solutions. But in dealing with conflicts of\nvalues, \u2018The concrete situation is almost everything\u2019\n(1990, 18\u201319).\n\nOne of the main features of Berlin\u2019s account of pluralism is the\nemphasis placed on the act of choosing between values. Pluralism holds\nthat, in many cases, there is no single right answer. Berlin used this\nas an argument for the importance of liberty (see note 25) \u2013 or,\nperhaps more precisely, an argument against the restriction of liberty\nin order to impose the \u2018right\u2019 solution by force. Berlin\nalso made a larger argument about making choices. Pluralism involves\nconflicts, and thus choices, not only between particular values in\nindividual cases, but between ways of life. While Berlin seems to\nsuggest that individuals have certain inherent traits \u2013 an\nindividual nature, or character, which cannot be wholly altered or\nobscured \u2013 he also insisted that they make decisions about who\nthey will be and what they will do. Choice is thus both an expression\nof an individual personality, and part of what makes that personality;\nit is essential to the human self.\n",
