    "main_text": "Definitions of the Turing Machine || Post\u2019s Definition\n1.2 Post\u2019s Definition\n\nTuring\u2019s definition was standardized through (some of)\nPost\u2019s modifications of it in Post 1947. In that paper Post\nproves that a certain problem from mathematics known as Thue\u2019s\nproblem or the word problem for semi-groups is not Turing computable\n(or, in Post\u2019s words, recursively unsolvable). Post\u2019s main\nstrategy was to show that if it were decidable then the following\ndecision problem from Turing 1936\u20137 would also be decidable:\n\n\nPRINT? The problem to decide for every Turing machine\nM whether or not it will ever print some symbol (for instance,\n0).\n\n\nIt was however proven by Turing that PRINT? is not\nTuring computable and so the same is true of Thue\u2019s problem.\n\nWhile the uncomputability of PRINT? plays a central\nrole in Post\u2019s proof, Post believed that Turing\u2019s proof of\nthat was affected by the \u201cspurious Turing convention\u201d\n(Post 1947: 9), viz. the system of F and E-squares.\nThus, Post introduced a modified version of the Turing machine. The\nmost important differences between Post\u2019s and Turing\u2019s\ndefinition are:\n\n\n\nPost\u2019s Turing machine, when in a given state, either prints or\nmoves and so its transition rules are more \u2018atomic\u2019 (it\ndoes not have the composite operation of moving and printing). This\nresults in the quadruple notation of Turing machines, where each\nquadruple is in one of the three forms of\n Table 3:\n\n\nTable 3: Post\u2019s Quadruple\nnotation \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\\hline\n& q_iS_jS_{i,j}q_{i,j}\\\\\n& q_iS_jLq_{i,j}\\\\\n& q_iS_jRq_{i,j}\\\\\\hline\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n \nPost\u2019s Turing machine has only one kind of symbol and so\ndoes not rely on the Turing system of F and\nE-squares.\nPost\u2019s Turing machine has a two-way infinite tape.\nPost\u2019s Turing machine halts when it reaches a state for\nwhich no actions are defined.\n\n\nNote that Post\u2019s reformulation of the Turing machine is very\nmuch rooted in his Post 1936. (Some of) Post\u2019s modifications of Turing\u2019s\ndefinition became part of the definition of the Turing machine in\nstandard works such as Kleene 1952 and Davis 1958. Since that time,\nseveral (logically equivalent) definitions have been introduced.\nToday, standard definitions of Turing machines are, in some respects,\ncloser to Post\u2019s Turing machines than to Turing\u2019s\nmachines. In what follows we will use a variant on the standard\ndefinition from Minsky 1967 which uses the quintuple notation but has no E and\nF-squares and includes a special halting state H. It\nalso has only two move operations, viz., L and R and so\nthe action whereby the machine merely prints is not used. When the\nmachine is started, the tape is blank except for some finite portion\nof the tape. Note that the blank square can also be represented as a\nsquare containing the symbol \\(S_0\\) or simply 0. The finite content\nof the tape will also be called the dataword on the tape.\n",
