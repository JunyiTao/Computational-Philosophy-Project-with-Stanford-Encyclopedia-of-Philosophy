    "main_text": "\n\nThe identity theory of truth was influential in the formative years of\nmodern analytic philosophy, and has come to prominence again recently.\nBroadly speaking, it sees itself as a reaction against correspondence\ntheories of truth, which maintain that truth-bearers are made\ntrue by facts. The identity theory maintains, against this, that\nat least some truth-bearers are not made true by, but are\nidentical with, facts. The theory is normally applied not at\nthe level of declarative sentences, but to what such sentences\nexpress. It is these items\u2014or, again, some of them\u2014that\nare held to be identical with facts. Identity theorists diverge over\nthe details of this general picture, depending on what exactly they\ntake declarative sentences to express, whether Fregean thoughts (at\nthe level of sense), Russellian propositions (at the level of\nreference), or both, and depending also on how exactly facts are\nconstrued. But, to give a precise illustration, an identity theorist\nwho thinks that declarative sentences express Russellian propositions\nwill typically hold that true such propositions are identical with\nfacts. The significance of the identity theory, for its supporters, is\nthat it appears to make available the closing of a certain gap that\nmight otherwise be thought to open up between language and world\nand/or between mind and world. If its supporters are right about this,\nthe identity theory of truth potentially has profound consequences\nboth in metaphysics and in the philosophies of mind and language.\n",
