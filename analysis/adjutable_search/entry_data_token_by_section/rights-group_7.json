Group rights and individual rights: co-existence and complementarity?\n\nA number of things might be said in response to these worries. First,\nvery much depends upon the content that we give group rights. It is\npossible to invest individual rights with a content that would make\nthem unsavoury, but that would not discredit the very idea of\nindividual rights; similarly, the possibility that we might find some\ngroup rights objectionable is no reason to dismiss group rights\naltogether. Secondly, it would seem strangely arbitrary, given the\nmoral significance that we give to rights, to insist that the objects\nof rights can be only goods that individuals can enjoy as independent\nindividuals and never goods they can enjoy only in association with\nothers. Some theorists of rights seem to think just that. But we\ncannot take for granted that no good, whose shared nature was such\nthat it could be the possible object only of a group right, could ever\nhave the significance that would justify its actually being the object\nof a right.\n\nThirdly, there is no reason why individual rights and group rights\nshould not both figure in our moral thinking. Indeed, they commonly\ndo. For example, it would be entirely commonplace to hold that a\npeople, as a political unit, has a collective right to be\nself-determining but only within the limits set by individuals\u2019 human\nrights. Group rights do not have to clash with individual rights and a\ncomplete moral theory would articulate individual rights and group\nrights so that they formed a coherent set (cf. Buchanan 1994; De\nFeyter and Pavlakos 2008; Holder and Corntassel 2002; Jones 2018). It\nmay prove impossible to anticipate and avoid every conflict amongst\nrights, but, even if it does, we need not suppose that conflicts will\narise more commonly between group rights and individual rights than\namongst individual rights themselves (McDonald 1998; Waldron 1993,\n203-24).\n\nThere is also a well-established tradition of political thought,\nassociated particularly with Alexis de Tocqueville and the English\nPluralists, which sees the existence of groups as essential to the\ndispersion of power and maintenance of liberty within a society.\nAccording to that tradition, groups do not glower threateningly at\nindividuals. Rather, the rights of groups help to counter and hold in\ncheck a potentially overmighty state. (Stapleton 1995; Lustgarten\n1983. See also Frohnen 2005 and Gedicks 1989.)\n\nGroup rights and individual rights can, then, co-exist more or less\npeacefully, but it is also possible for them to enjoy a more positive\nand mutually supportive relationship. Raz has pointed out that\nindividual rights frequently presuppose the existence of general\nsocial goods and individual rights themselves frequently promote\nsocial goods (1986, 193\u2013216, 245\u2013263; 1995). Indeed,\nindividual rights may sometimes be rights only because they promote\nsocial goods. Raz does not claim that those social goods are generally\nthe objects of group rights, but he does expose the error of supposing\nthat an antagonism towards collective considerations is somehow built\ninto the very idea or purpose of individual rights. The interests that\ngroup rights and individual rights seek to protect will frequently be\nthe same interests.\n\nIndeed, it may sometimes be an individual right that makes the case\nfor a group right. We might argue, for example, that some of the goods\nto which individuals have rights depend for their realisation upon the\nhealth of the communities and cultures to which those individuals\nbelong, so that there is a case for individuals sharing in group\nrights because those rights serve their individual rights or their\nindividual freedom (Jacobs 1991; Kymlicka 1989, 1995; Wellman 1999).\nOr we might argue that individuals have equal rights to the conditions\nof self-development, that individual self-development requires common\nor joint activity, and that that makes the case for group rights to\nthe conditions necessary for that common or joint activity (Gould\n2001). Or, again, we might hold that amongst the range of options\nrequired for individual autonomy are joint options, options to pursue\nends that require co-ordinated activity with other members of one\u2019s\ngroup; that too may justify group rights, such as the right of a group\nto control its own affairs (Wall 2007). The claim here might be either\nthat a group right is conducive to, or, more strongly, that it is\nessential for, the realisation of an individual right.\n\nNewman too argues that some individual rights presuppose group rights\n(2011, 76-82). His general analysis of the relationship between\nindividual and group rights is both nuanced and qualified (2011, Part\nII). As we have seen, he conceives right-holding groups as having\nrights grounded in their interests as groups, interests that are not\nreducible to the interests of their members taken severally. Even so,\nhe insists that group rights must be consistent with the\n\u201chumanistic principle\u201d, which holds that what matters\nultimately is the well-being of individual human persons. In that\nrespect, he is, like List and Pettit (2011), a value-individualist and\nnot, like Jovanovi\u0107 (2012), a value-collectivist. A group right\ncannot ultimately be in competition with the well-being of the group\u2019s\nmembers. He formulates that requirement as \u201cthe service\nprinciple\u201d: if the claims a group makes upon its members are to\nbe legitimate, those claims must serve the interests of the group\u2019s\nmembers. He pairs that with a \u201cmutuality principle\u201d: a\nright-holding group cannot act without regard for the well-being of\noutsiders, be they individuals or other groups. The service principle\ndoes not, however, translate into the familiar claim that individual\nrights must invariably displace group rights. People have interests\nboth as individuals and as group members and sometimes their interests\nas members may matter more than their interests as individuals. Newman\ntherefore cautions against supposing that compliance with his\nhumanistic principle means that group rights must always take second\nplace to individual rights.\n",
