    "main_text": "Significant Interactions Between Modalities || The Relationship Between Knowledge and Beliefs\n4.1 The Relationship Between Knowledge and Beliefs\n\nThe interplay between knowledge and belief is an important topic in\nepistemology. Historically, one of the most important proposals is\nPlato\u2019s characterization of knowledge as\n justified true belief,\n which has been one of the motivations used in the development of\n justification logic.\n However, can knowledge be truly defined as justified true belief? The\n examples\n provided (among others) in Gettier (1963) seem to go against this\nidea. Gettier describes situations in which an agent believes a given\n\\(\\varphi\\) and has a justification for it; moreover, \\(\\varphi\\) is\nindeed the case. Nevertheless, the justification is not an appropriate\none: \\(\\varphi\\) happens to be the case because of some other lucky\nunrelated circumstances. This has lead to proposals that focus on the\nrequirement of a correct justification (the no false\nlemma: Clark 1963; Armstrong 1973; Shope 1983). Some others have\nused a stronger indefeasibility requirement, stating that\nknowledge is justified true belief that cannot be defeated by true\ninformation, i.e., there is no true proposition \\(\\psi\\) such that, if\nthe agent were to learn that \\(\\psi\\) was the case, would lead her to\ngive up her belief, or to be no longer justified in holding it (Klein\n1971; Lehrer & Paxson 1969; Swain 1974). The aforementioned\ntopological modal approach of Baltag, Bezhanishvili, et al. (2016)\nrelates this idea with other epistemic concepts, and a deeper\ndiscussion on what it means to know something can be found in\n the analysis of knowledge\n by Ichikawa and Steup (2018).\n\nThere are also other alternatives. An interesting proposal, discussed\nin Lenzen (1978) and Williamson (2002), follows the other direction:\nstart from a chosen notion of knowledge, and then weaken it in order\nto obtain a \u2018good\u2019 (e.g., consistent, introspective,\npossibly false) notion of belief. These ideas have been discussed in\nformal settings. In Stalnaker (2006), the author argues that the\n\u201ctrue\u201d logic of knowledge is the modal logic S4.2, given\nby the standard K axiom \\((K(\\varphi \\rightarrow\\psi)\n\\rightarrow (K\\varphi \\rightarrow K\\psi))\\) and the generalization\nrule \\((K\\varphi\\) for every validity \\(\\varphi)\\), together with\nveridicality \\((K\\varphi \\rightarrow \\varphi\\): knowledge is\ntruthful), positive introspection \\((K\\varphi \\rightarrow KK\\varphi\\):\nif the agent knows \\(\\varphi\\), then she knows that she knows it) and\nthe \u2018convergence\u2019 principle \\((\\hK K\\varphi \\rightarrow\nK\\hK\\varphi\\): if the agent considers it possible to know \\(\\varphi\\),\nthen she knows that she considers \\(\\varphi\\) a possibility). In this\nsetting, Stalnaker (2006) argues that belief can be defined as the\nepistemic possibility of knowledge, that is, \n\\[\nB\\varphi := \\hK K\\varphi\n\\]\n\n\nNote how this is exactly what the definition of belief in the\npreviously discussed plausibility models entails: if the modality\n\\([\\leq]\\) is understood as indefeasible knowledge (Lehrer 1990;\nLehrer & Paxson 1969), then \\(B\\varphi :=\n\\langle{\\leq}\\rangle[{\\leq}]\\varphi\\) states that belief is the\npossibility of knowledge. In this context, it is a small step to move\nfrom studying simple beliefs to conditional beliefs. A complete\naxiomatization of the logic of indefeasible knowledge and conditional\nbelief, first posed as an open question in Board (2004), was provided\nwith a solution in Baltag and Smets (2008).\n\nA further proposal that uses knowledge as the basic notion is that of\nBaltag, Bezhanishvili, \u00d6zg\u00fcn, and Smets (2013), which\ngeneralizes Stalnaker\u2019s (2006) formalization by using a\ntopological (neighborhood) semantics. An important feature of\nthe notion of belief that arises in this setting is that it is\nsubjectively indistinguishable from knowledge: an agent believes\n\\(\\varphi\\) \\((B\\varphi)\\) if and only if she believes that she knows\nit \\((BK\\varphi)\\).\n",
