    "main_text": "Metaphysics Naturalized || Truth\n5.3 Truth\n\nTruth, in Quine\u2019s view, is immanent, as opposed to transcendent.\nIn accord with his fundamental naturalism, he sees judgments of truth\nas made from within our theory of the world. For this reason, he\nsympathizes with what is sometimes called disquotational theory of\ntruth: to say that a sentence is true is, in effect, to assert the\nsentence. Two qualifications must be made. First, the disquotational\nview is not a definition of \u201cis true\u201d. It enables\nus to eliminate the predicate from contexts in which it is applied to\na finite number of specific sentences, but not from contexts where it\nis applied to infinitely many. Contexts of the latter kind are of\nparticular importance to logical theory. We say, for example, that a\nconjunction is true just in case both conjuncts are true; here\n\u201cis true\u201d cannot be eliminated. (Unless, indeed, we ascend\nto a metalanguage and give a definition of truth for the object\nlanguage that we are concerned with, following Tarski 1933.) Second,\ncalling an eternal sentence true is in one way unlike asserting it. If\nwe subsequently change our verdict on it we say that we used to\nbelieve it but now we don\u2019t. We do not, however, say that it\nused to be true but now it isn\u2019t; rather we say that it was\nnever true. Quine, however, sees this as simply a point of usage, with\nno particular philosophical implications.\n",
