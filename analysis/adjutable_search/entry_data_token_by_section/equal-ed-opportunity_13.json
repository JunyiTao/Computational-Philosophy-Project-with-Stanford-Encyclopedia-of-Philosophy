    "main_text": "The Meaning of and Debates about Equality of Educational Opportunity || Equality and Adequacy in the Distribution of Educational Opportunities\n3.9 Equality and Adequacy in the Distribution of Educational Opportunities\n\nA longstanding debate in the literature juxtaposes the view that we\nshould prioritize equality in the distribution of educational\nopportunities with the view that an \u201cadequacy\u201d approach is\nthe right one (on this debate, see Reich 2013). Those who advocate the\nequality view may insist on equal outputs (i.e., educational outcomes,\nlike the mastery of particular skills) or inputs (i.e., educational\nresources, like equal per pupil funding or qualified teachers). The\nadequacy view, by contrast, is seen as holding that what matters most\nis meeting a specified educational threshold.\n\nIn the context of school finance litigation in the U.S., advocates\noften invoke these two distributive ideals together rather than\nregarding them as being at odds (Rebell 2009: 21\u201322; Ryan 2008:\n1232\u20131238). Although most school finance litigation in the U.S.\ntoday is pursued from an adequacy framework given its greater\npolitical viability, litigators often make comparative claims about\nstudents\u2019 educational opportunities to bolster their case.\nConversely in contexts where lawyers pursue equality claims, they\nfrequently appeal to a conception of educational quality (e.g.,\nachieving literacy, numeracy, and civic skills) to anchor their\nclaims, and to avoid the leveling-down problem whereby equality is\nachieved by making everyone worse off, without regard for the\nrealization of particular educational goals.\n\nSome philosophical work has similarly undercut the sharp\nequality/adequacy distinction and shows how the two ideals are closely\nintertwined in the pursuit of educational justice. These approaches\n(e.g., Satz 2007; Anderson 2007) argue that adequacy in education has\na relative and comparative component because the educational threshold\ndepends on the knowledge and skills that others have, and so it is\nnecessarily a moving target. For example, what it takes to serve on a\njury, or to have an adequate opportunity for college, depends on the\nknowledge and skill levels of others. This \u201crelational\u201d\napproach to adequacy can respond to one of the strongest concerns\nproponents of equality raise: that because many of the benefits of\neducation are positional, which is to say, their value depends upon\none\u2019s position relative to others, equality is the right\ndistributive principle for educational opportunities. The meritocratic\ndistribution of jobs, where the most qualified candidate is appointed\n(rather than the individual who is merely well-qualified), ensures\nthat positionality is decisive in many cases. Conceptions of adequacy\nthat are attentive to relevant comparative claims can address this\nissue and thereby deflate the tension between adequacy and equality\napproaches to distributing educational opportunities.\n\nHowever one interprets equality of educational of opportunity, a\nnumber of important challenges face anyone who believes that the ideal\nis a crucial component of a fair and just society. Several of these\nchallenges are philosophical in nature. For instance, one can ask\nwhether certain values (e.g., respecting family autonomy) compete with\nthe demands of equality of opportunity in education in ways that trump\nor are trumped by concerns about educational equality. One can also\nask whether equal educational opportunity requires affirmative action,\nand what it may require for students with disabilities and special\neducational needs. One can accept equality of educational opportunity\nwith respect to some goods and adequacy of educational opportunity\nwith respect to others (Callan 2016). There are other challenges that\nare not philosophical but practical, such as how we can convince\npolicymakers to allocate sufficient funds to meet students\u2019\neducational needs, and how we might increase public support for the\nideal of equality of educational opportunity more generally.\n",
