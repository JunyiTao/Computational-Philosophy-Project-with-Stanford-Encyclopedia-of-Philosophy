    "main_text": "Normative Issues || Good and Bad Sex\n2.1 Good and Bad Sex\n\n\u201cGood sex\u201d and \u201cbad sex\u201d can refer to\npleasurable as well as to morally, aesthetically, practically, and\nlegally good or bad sex and to natural and unnatural sex (Soble 2008,\n85\u201387; Soble, with Halwani 2017, 8\u201316).\n\nIt is unclear what aesthetic sex is (it is in need of philosophical\nexploration), but applying some common aesthetic concepts, such as\n\u201cunity\u201d, \u201ccoherence\u201d, and\n\u201ccompleteness\u201d\u2014concepts used in defining the\naesthetic experience (Beardsley 1982, chs. 1, 5, 16; cf. Levine 2006;\nSinger 2001, ch. 5)\u2014might be useful: a sexual act can be\ncoherent, unified, and fulfills the parties\u2019 expectations (this\nis Monroe Beardsley\u2019s view of completeness; 1982, 85\u201386).\nAssuming these three are the only components of aesthetic experiences,\nsexual activity can provide an aesthetic experience to its\nparticipants. Other concepts, such as \u201cbeauty\u201d and its\nopposites (e.g., \u201cdullness\u201d, \u201cmonotony\u201d,\n\u201cthe disgusting\u201d, \u201cthe insipid\u201d) can also be\nrelevant, though whether they retain their aesthetic sense when\napplied to sex is the question. This last point is as true, if not\nmore, of \u201cpleasure\u201d: Is there such a thing as aesthetic\npleasure, and can it be a property of sexual acts? (Shusterman 2021\nprovides historical in-depth treatment of the relationship between sex\nand aesthetics).\n\nSex can also be practically or pragmatically good or bad: a\n\u201csexting\u201d politician can ruin his career, unprotected\nsexual intercourse risks contracting HIV, sex without contraception\nrisks (undesired) pregnancy, and public sex risks arrest. Practically\ngood sex does not lead to bad results and might have positive\noutcomes: a sense of rejuvenation, loss of calories, or a wanted\npregnancy.\n\n\u201cGood sex\u201d most obviously refers to pleasurable sex. A sex\nact can be good or bad depending on the amount and intensity of the\npleasure or pain it provides (Vannoy 1980, ch. 3), though pain in sex\ncan contribute to its pleasure (e.g., in bondage and sadomasochism).\nWe must keep in mind the different senses of \u201cpleasure\u201d\nthat can come into play, especially pleasure-as-sensation and\npleasure-as-enjoyment.\n",
