    "main_text": "Population Ecology || Deterministic Models\n2.1 Deterministic Models\n\n\nIf population sizes are large, they can be studied using deterministic\nmodels, that is, fluctuations in populations sizes due to chance\nfactors (such as accidental births and deaths) can be ignored.\nUsually a model considers members of a single or a very few\ninteracting species, for instance, a few predator and a prey\n species.[13]\n A typical result, based on the Lotka-Volterra (coupled differential\nequations) model, is that predator-prey interactions lead to\npopulation cycles, with the predator population cycle temporally\ntracking the prey population cycle. The explanation of this phenomenon\nis straightforward: as prey populations increase, the increased\navailability of resources allows a rise in predator populations a\nlittle later in time. But the increase of predators leads to an\nincrease of prey consumption and, consequently, a decrease in prey\npopulations. But, now, the lack of resources leads to a decline of\npredator populations. As predator populations decline, prey\npopulations increase initiating the cycle once again. See\nFigure 1:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Predator-Prey Population Cycles: \n The model is due to Volterra ([1927] 1978, pp. 80-100, the diagram is\nfrom p. 100). There are two species, a predator species with a\npopulation, N2, which only feeds on a single prey\nspecies with population, N1. The model incorporates\ndemographic stochasticity which, nevertheless, does not stamp out the\nbasic cyclic pattern. (t is a measure of time.)\n  \n\n The Lotka-Volterra model mathematically predicts these cycles. As\nsuch, it exemplifies the explanatory ideal of ecology: not only is\nthere a predictively accurate quantitative model, but the mechanisms\nincorporated in the model have a perspicuous biological\ninterpretation. Unfortunately, in ecology, because of the\nformalization and interpretation indeterminacy problems, the last\ncondition is rarely satisfied.\n\n\nFor the simpler case of single species, two standard models are that\nof exponential and logistic growth.  The exponential growth model is\nsupposed to capture the behavior of a population when there is no\nresource limitation; the logistic growth model is one of the simplest\nways to try to capture the self-regulation of population sizes when\nthere is such a\n limitation.[14]\nSee Box 1.1 and 1.2.\n\nBox 1.1 Exponential Growth Model\nLet a population consist of n individuals\nat time t.  Suppose that, in an infinitesimal time\ninterval between t and t+dt,\na fraction b/n of individuals give \nbirth and a fraction d/n die. Let the\nchange in the size of the population be dn. Then\n\n \ndn/dt =\n (b \u2212 d).\n \nLet r = b \u2212 d. Then the\npopulation dynamics is described by the growth equation:\n\ndn/dt = m.\n \nThis is the exponential growth model. It\nassumes that no resource limitation constrains the \"intrinsic\ngrowth rate\", r. It can be solved to give:\n\nn(t) =\n n0ert,\n  \nwhere n0 is the size of the population\nat t0. \n\n\n\n\nBox 1.2 Logistic Growth Model\nOne way to modify the exponential growth model to\nincorporate resource limitation is to replace the growth\nequation of the exponential\nmodel by that of the logistic growth model:\n\n \ndn/dt = m(1 \u2212 n/K),\n \nwhere K is called the \"carrying capacity\" of \nthe environment; this parameter is supposed to incorporate\nhow resource limitation affects population growth by regulating\nit.  When n = K, the growth rate,\n\ndn/dt = 0\n \nand the population does not grow any further. Moreover, \nwhen there is no resource limitation, that is K\n\u2192 \u221e, this model reduces to the exponential\ngrowth model.  Figure 2b shows how a population \ngoverned by the logistic equation grows in size.\nAt the level of individual behavior, this model\ndoes not have the kind of justification that the exponential\ngrowth model does in the sense that the \nlogistic equation cannot be plausibly derived from the\nproperties of individuals. In this sense it is a purely\n\"phenomenological\" model.\n\n\n The exponential growth model appeals to only one essentially\necological parameter, the intrinsic growth rate (r) of a\npopulation, interpreted as the rate at which the population would grow\nif there were no external factor limiting growth; the logistic model\nalso appeals to the carrying capacity (K), interpreted as the\nmaximum size of the population that can persist in a given\nenvironment.  See Figures 2a and 2b:\n\n\n\n\n (a)\n\n\n\n (b)\n\nFigures 2a and 2b: The Logistic Growth Model\n\n The figure on the top (from Gause [1934], p. 35) shows theoretical\ncurves. \u201cGeometric increase\u201d represents the exponential\ngrowth model discussed in the text; \u201csaturating population\u201d\nrefers to the carrying capacity (see\n Box 2).\n The figure on the bottom (from Gause [1934], p. 36) shows\nan example of an empirical growth curve obtained in the laboratory. If\nthe curve is fitted to a logistic curve (to which it shows similarity),\nthen K = 375 is the estimated carrying capacity.\n\n\n In general, biological experience suggests that all populations\nregulate their sizes, that is, they show self-regulation. Theoretical\nexploration of models has made it clear that a wide variety of\nmechanisms can lead to such self-regulation but it is usually unclear\nwhich models are more plausible than others thanks to the typical\nformalization indeterminacy of the field. Moreover, the precise\nmechanisms that are playing regulative roles in individual cases are\noften very hard to determine in the field, a classic case of partial\nobservability. Even parameters such as the intrinsic growth rate and\ncarrying capacity are unusually difficult to estimate precisely.\n\n\nThe last mentioned difficulties are perhaps most famously illustrated\nby the 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares, muskrats and their predators\nin the North American boreal forests and, especially, the 4-year cycle\nof lemmings and, possibly, other microtines in the arctic tundra of\nEurasia and North America. In spite of almost seventy-five years of\ncontinuous research on these well-documented cycles the mechanisms\ndriving them remain unresolved. Models producing such cycles abound,\nbut the structural uncertainty of most of these models, coupled with\npartial observability of many of the parameters in the field have\nprecluded resolution of the\n debate.[15]\n\n\nThe models discussed so far are continuous-time models, that is, the\ntemporal or dynamic parameter is assumed to be a continuous variable.\nHowever, discrete-time models have also been used to study population\nprocesses. A discrete analog of the logistic growth model was one of\nthe first systems in which chaotic dynamic phenomena were\n discovered.[16]\n Over the years there has been considerable debate over the question\nwhether ecological systems with chaotic dynamics exist in nature; the\ncurrent consensus is that they have not yet been\n found.[17]\n",
