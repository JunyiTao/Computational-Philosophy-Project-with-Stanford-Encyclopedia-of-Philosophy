    "main_text": "\nFoundational work in game theory aims at making explicit the\nassumptions that underlie the basic concepts of the\ndiscipline. Non-cooperative game theory is the study of individual,\nrational decision making in situations of strategic interaction. This\nentry presents the epistemic foundations of non-cooperative\ngame theory (this area of research is called epistemic game\ntheory).\nEpistemic game theory views rational decision making in games as\nsomething not essentially different from rational decision making\nunder uncertainty. As in Decision Theory (Peterson 2009), to choose\nrationally in a game is to select the \u201cbest\u201d action in\nlight of one\u2019s beliefs or information. In a decision problem,\nthe decision maker\u2019s beliefs are about a passive state of\nnature, the state of which determines the consequences of her\nactions. In a game, the consequences of one\u2019s decision depend on\nthe choices of the other agents involved in the situation\n(and possibly the state of nature). Recognizing this\u2014i.e., that\none is interacting with other agents who try to choose the best course\nof action in the light of their own\nbeliefs\u2014brings higher-order information into the\npicture. The players\u2019 beliefs are no longer about a passive or\nexternal environment. They concern the choices and the\ninformation of the other players. What one expects of one\u2019s\nopponents depends on what one thinks the others expect from her, and\nwhat the others expect from a given player depends on what they think\nher expectations about them are.\nThis entry provides an overview of the issues that arise when one\ntakes this broadly decision-theoretic view on rational decision making\nin games. After some general comments about information in games, we\npresent the formal tools developed in epistemic game theory and\nepistemic logic that have been used to understand the role of\nhigher-order information in interactive decision making. We then show\nhow these tools can be used to characterize known \u201csolution\nconcepts\u201d of games in terms of rational decision making in\nspecific informational contexts. Along the way, we highlight a number\nof philosophical issues that arise in this area.\n",
