    "main_text": "Active Intellect, Human Intellect, Immortality, and Prophecy || Conjunction\n6.3 Conjunction\n\n\nIn addition to this language of overflow, Maimonides speaks of the\nmoment of perfected human contact with active intellect in terms of a\n\u201cconjunction\u201d (itti\u1e63\u0101l) between the\nhuman intellect and active intellect. The notion and language of\nitti\u1e63\u0101l in particular can be seen in Maimonides when he\nspeaks, for example, of active intellect as the \u201cdivine\nintellect conjoined (al-mutta\u1e63il) with man\u201d (G 1.1, P\n23; for Arabic see Munk 1931, 15). While it might be noted that this\nlanguage of itti\u1e63\u0101l can conceptually be linked to a notion of unification at play in Sufi\ndiscussions of union-with-God (with its Hebrew correlate,\ndev\u0113q\u016bth, occuring frequently in Jewish\nKabbalistic writings), Maimonides' own use of the concept of\nitti\u1e63\u0101l (to describe conjunction with the active\nintellect) is in line with the commonplace technical terminology at\nplay in Arabic textual traditions of [Neoplatonized] Aristotelian\nepistemology.\n",
