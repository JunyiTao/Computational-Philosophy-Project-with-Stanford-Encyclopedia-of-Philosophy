    "main_text": "Unity Across Time || Retention and Memory\n5.1 Retention and Memory\n\nIn its synchronic form, we have suggested that a natural way to think\nof unified consciousness is in terms of joint consciousness.\nDiachronically, unified consciousness has an additional feature; it\nrequires retention over time, specifically, retention of earlier\nexperienced contents as one experienced them. What the retention\ncrucial to diachronic unity consists in is a matter of some interest.\nIt is tempting to assume that it is a kind of memory. However, as\nHusserl already told us, there is reason to be sceptical of this\napproach. There is a difference between experiencing a\nsuccession from time 1 to time 2 and merely remembering\nexperiencing what happened at time 1 while experiencing something at\ntime 2. Dainton captures Husserl\u2019s point by noting the\ndifference between \u201cimmediate and represented\nexperience\u2014remembering or imagining hearing a tone is not the\nsame as directly experiencing the tone\u201d (Dainton 2005: 155;\nDainton cites Husserl 1928).\n\nKelly (2005) raises a similar question. Suppose that one is listening\nto a melody. It has five notes and the final note is just being\nplayed. If one simply recollected the earlier notes, one should\nexperience a chord, not five notes spread out and related to one\nanother in time. Somehow, the earlier notes come\n\u2018date-stamped\u2019 but still available to be integrated with\nthe current experience in a single, temporally-extended, unified\nexperience. Whatever this process is like, it is clearly vital to our\nkind of unified consciousness. Without it, one could not hear any\nsequence as a sequence or so much as read a simple sentence. Though\nsome theorists call this across-time process unity of consciousness, a\nmore distinctive name for it would be the continuity of\nconsciousness.\n\nThis sort of continuity of consciousness can span very short durations\n(such as the \u2018specious present\u2019). Even a seemingly simple,\ncurrent experience is in fact a continuous experience of more than one\ninstant, and must be if one is to hear a sound or perceive\n(as opposed to remember) any temporally stretched phenomenon. How can\none have a unified conscious experience (not just a memory) of\nduration?\n\nHere again the debate that we mentioned earlier over whether a unified\nconscious experience is one experience or an assembly of many\nexperiences rears its head. Dainton (2005: chs. 5\u20137) takes a\ncontinuous, unified experience to include co-conscious experiences as\nparts. Tye (2003: ch. 4) urges instead that a diachronically unified\nexperience has multiple contents but no experiences as parts.\n",
