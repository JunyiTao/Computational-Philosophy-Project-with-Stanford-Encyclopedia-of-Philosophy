    "main_text": "The Measurement Problem\n7. The Measurement Problem\n\nThe\n measurement problem\n is the most commonly cited of the conceptual difficulties that plague\nquantum mechanics. (It amounts, more or less, to the paradox of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat.) Indeed, for many physicists the\nmeasurement problem is not merely one conceptual difficulty of quantum\nmechanics; it is the conceptual difficulty. \n\nThe problem is as follows. Suppose that the wave function of any\nindividual system provides a complete description of that system. When\nwe analyze the process of measurement in quantum mechanical terms, we\nfind that the after-measurement wave function for system and apparatus\nthat arises from Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation for the composite\nsystem typically involves a superposition over terms corresponding to\nwhat we would like to regard as the various possible results of the\nmeasurement\u2014e.g., different pointer orientations. In this\ndescription of the after-measurement situation it is difficult to\ndiscern the actual result of the measurement\u2014e.g., some specific\npointer orientation. But the whole point of quantum theory, and the\nreason we should believe in it, is that it is supposed to provide a\ncompelling, or at least an efficient, account of our observations,\nthat is, of the outcomes of measurements. In short, the measurement\nproblem is this: Quantum theory implies that measurements typically\nfail to have outcomes of the sort the theory was created to\nexplain.\n\nIn contrast, if we, like Einstein, regard the description provided by\nthe wave function as incomplete, the measurement problem vanishes:\nThere is no measurement problem with a theory or interpretation in\nwhich, as in Bohmian mechanics, the description of the\nafter-measurement situation includes, in addition to the wave\nfunction, at least the values of the variables that register the\nresult. In Bohmian mechanics pointers always point.\n\nOften, the measurement problem is expressed a little differently.\nTextbook quantum theory provides two rules for the evolution of the\nwave function of a quantum system: A deterministic dynamics given by\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation when the system is not being\n\u201cmeasured\u201d or observed, and a random collapse of the wave\nfunction to an eigenstate of the \u201cmeasured\nobservable\u201d when it is. However, the objection continues,\ntextbook quantum theory does not explain how to reconcile these two\napparently incompatible rules.\n\nThat this formulation of the measurement problem and the preceding one\nare more or less equivalent should be reasonably clear: If a wave\nfunction provides a complete description of the after-measurement\nsituation, the outcome of the measurement must correspond to a wave\nfunction that describes the actual result, that is, a\n\u201ccollapsed\u201d wave function. Hence the collapse rule. But it\nis difficult to take seriously the idea that different laws than those\ngoverning all other interactions should govern those interactions\nbetween system and apparatus that we happen to call measurements.\nHence the apparent incompatibility of the two rules.\n\nThe second formulation of the measurement problem, though basically\nequivalent to the first, raises an important question: Can Bohmian\nmechanics itself reconcile these two dynamical rules? How does Bohmian\nmechanics justify the use of the \u201ccollapsed\u201d wave function\ninstead of the original one? This question was answered in\nBohm\u2019s first papers on Bohmian mechanics (Bohm 1952: Part I,\nSection 7 and Part II, Section 2). What would nowadays be called\neffects of decoherence, produced by interaction with the environment\n(air molecules, cosmic rays, internal microscopic degrees of freedom,\netc.), make it very difficult for significant overlap to develop\nbetween the component of the after-measurement wave function\ncorresponding to the actual result of the measurement and the other\ncomponents of the after-measurement wave function. (This overlap\nrefers to the configuration space of the very large system that\nincludes all systems with which the original system and apparatus come\ninto interaction.) But without such overlap that component all by\nitself generates to a high degree of accuracy the future evolution of\nthe configuration of the system and apparatus. The replacement is thus\njustified as a practical matter (see also D\u00fcrr, Goldstein &\nZangh\u00ec 1992a: Section 5).\n\nMany proponents of orthodox quantum theory believe that decoherence\nsomehow resolves the measurement problem itself. It is not easy to\nunderstand this belief. In the first formulation of the measurement\nproblem, nothing prevents us from including in the apparatus all\nsources of decoherence. But then decoherence can no longer be in any\nway relevant to the argument. Be that as it may, Bohm (1952) gave one\nof the best descriptions of the mechanisms of decoherence, though he\ndid not use the word itself. He recognized its importance several\ndecades before it became fashionable. (See also the encyclopedia entry\non\n The Role of Decoherence in Quantum Mechanics.)\n",
