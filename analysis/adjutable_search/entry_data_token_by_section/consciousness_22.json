Though unconscious automatic processes can\nbe extremely efficient and rapid, they typically operate in ways that\nare more fixed and predetermined than those which involve conscious\nself-awareness (Anderson 1983). Conscious awareness is thus of most\nimportance when one is dealing with novel situations and previously\nunencountered problems or demands (Penfield 1975, Armstrong 1981).\n\n\nStandard accounts of skill acquisition stress the importance of\nconscious awareness during the initial learning phase, which gradually\ngives way to more automatic processes of the sort that require little\nattention or conscious oversight (Schneider and Shiffrin 1977).\nConscious processing allows for the construction or compilation of\nspecifically tailored routines out of elementary units as well as for\nthe deliberate control of their execution.\n\n\nThere is a familiar tradeoff between flexibility and speed;\ncontrolled conscious processes purchase their customized versatility at\nthe price of being slow and effortful in contrast to the fluid rapidity\nof automatic unconscious mental operations (Anderson 1983). The\nrelevant increases in flexibility would seem most closely connected\nwith the meta-mental or higher-order form of consciousness in so far as\nthe enhanced ability to control processes depends upon greater\nself-awareness. However, flexibility and sophisticated modes of control\nmay be associated as well with the phenomenal and access forms of\nconsciousness.\n",
