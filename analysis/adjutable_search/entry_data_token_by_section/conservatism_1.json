    "main_text": "The Nature of Conservatism || Narrow sense or Burkean conservatism as scepticism about reason\n1.2 Narrow sense or Burkean conservatism as scepticism about reason\n\nIn its narrow, self-conscious sense, conservatism can be characterised\nas an\n\n\napproach to human affairs which mistrusts both a priori\nreasoning and revolution, preferring to put its trust in experience\nand in the gradual improvement of tried and tested arrangements.\n(O\u2019Hear 1998)\n\n\nKekes argues similarly that conservatism, with its defining scepticism\nand opposition to \u201crationalism\u201d in politics, contrasts\nwith liberalism and socialism in rejecting a priori\nvalue-commitments (Kekes 1997: 368). This position was enunciated most\ntrenchantly by Burke, conservatism\u2019s \u201cmaster\nintellectual\u201d, acknowledged by almost all subsequent\nconservatives. He rejected a priori reasoning in politics,\nnotably claims to abstract natural rights, manifested most\ndramatically in the French Jacobin dream of destroying and rebuilding\nsociety. Burke holds that there is a practical wisdom in institutions\nthat is mostly not articulable theoretically, certainly not in\nadvance, but is passed down in culture and tradition. \n\nRevolutionary Jacobinism is conservatism\u2019s polar opposite and\nhistoric contender. The name comes from the Jacobin Club whose central\nfigure, Robespierre, launched the French Revolutionary Terror. (On\nrevolution and Jacobinism, see Graham 1986: 178\u201381.)\nConservatives such as Burke contrast the French Revolution with\nEngland\u2019s more peaceful Glorious Revolution of 1688, which for\nthem was a revolution in the original sense\u2014a return to an\nalleged status quo prior to monarchical absolutism, as\nopposed to an overturning of traditional institutions in accord with a\nrational plan. Conservatism and revolutionary Jacobinism are\ninter-dependent concepts that arose together, in conjunction with\nliberalism and socialism. One could argue that there is a conceptual\nholism between them, in that they cannot be understood independently\nof each other, and must be inter-defined (Hamilton 2013 ch 1.2). In\nits modern concept, political revolution is a rejection of the past;\nbefore the 18th century, according to most historians,\n\u201crevolution\u201d had only its literal sense of \u201creturn\nto an original state\u201d. (Cressy (2006) suggests that in the\nEnglish Civil War of the 1640s, a metaphorical use emerged, meaning\nsudden, dramatic change in politics or religion.) With the\nEnlightenment, the natural order or social hierarchy, previously\nlargely accepted, was questioned. (The earliest stirrings of this\nquestioning were found in the English Civil War and even the\nPeasant\u2019s Revolt.) Implicit in Jacobinism is what may be termed\nrevolutionary utopianism, which allows the sacrifice of present\ngenerations for alleged future benefit. A classic statement of\nrevolutionary utopianism is found in these frank remarks by\nTrotsky:\n\n\nthe White Terror\u2026is the weapon of classes which consider\nthemselves \u201cChristian\u201d, patronize idealist philosophy, and\nare firmly convinced that the individuality (their own) is an\nend-in-itself. As for us, we were never concerned with the\nKantian-priestly and vegetarian-Quaker prattle about the\n\u201csacredness of human life\u201d. We were revolutionaries in\nopposition, and have remained revolutionaries in power. To make the\nindividual sacred we must destroy the social order which crucifies\nhim. And this problem can only be solved by blood and iron. (Trotsky\n1920, ch. 4)\n\n\nAccording to critics of utopianism such as Schiller, indeed, one\nshould not even sacrifice oneself for a utopian vision, as do members\nof revolutionary organisations, such as Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo\nof the ANC. Schiller, and Goethe, also provided conservative critiques\nof French Revolutionary ideals and practices.\n\nConservatives reject revolutionary Jacobinism\u2019s espousal of\npolitical rationalism, which attempts to reconstruct society from\nabstract principles or general blueprint, without reference to\ntradition. Conservatives view society not as a machine but as a highly\ncomplex organism, and hold therefore that \u201cwithout the aid of\nexperience, reason cannot prescribe political ideals that can be\nrealised in practice\u201d (Beiser 1992: 283). Present generations\npossess duties and responsibilities whose original reasons, if they\nwere ever apparent, are now lost. Tradition represents for\nconservatives a continuum enmeshing the individual and social, and is\nimmune to reasoned critique; the radical intellectual is therefore\narrogant and dangerous (Kekes 1997: 365). For liberals and socialists,\nin contrast, tradition has value only insofar as it survives rational\ncriticism.\n\nConservatism therefore rests on what may be termed particularist\nscepticism concerning abstract rational principles. Conservatives\nregard the radical\u2019s rationalism as \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\nin ignoring particular social, economic and historical conditions:\n\n\nI cannot [praise or blame] human actions\u2026on a simple view of\nthe object, as it stands stripped of every relation, in all the\nnakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction; (Burke, WS III:\n58)\n\ncircumstances give every political principle its colour. (Cobban 1960:\n75)\n\n\nFor conservatives, abstract propositions cannot simply be applied to\nspecific circumstances. Unlike liberals and socialists, therefore,\nconservatives are particularist in rejecting universal prescriptions\nand panaceas; they reject the Enlightenment-modernist requirement that\npractical rationality is liberated from all particularism (Beveridge\nand Turnbull 1997). This is not \u201cparticularism\u201d in its\ndictionary definition of \u201cexclusive adherence to one\u2019s own\ngroup, party, sect, or nation\u201d; rather, it is a philosophical\nsense that has an affinity with moral particularism as advocated by\nDancy (2004). The parallel is incomplete, however; political\nconservatives do not deny that there are general principles, as Dancy\ndoes, they just deny that one should apply them. Their position is an\nessentially epistemic one\u2014that one cannot know the general\nprinciples whose implementation would benefit the operation of\nsociety. According to Gray, conservatism\u2019s fundamental insight\nis that\n\n\npersons\u2019 identities cannot be matters of choice, but are\nconferred on them by their unchosen histories, so that what is most\nessential about them is\u2026what is most accidental. The\nconservative vision is that people will come to value the privileges\nof choice\u2026when they see how much in their lives must always\nremain unchosen. (2010: 159)\n\n\nConservative scepticism is quite distinct from Cartesian or external\nworld scepticism, therefore, since the latter scepticism is based on\nreason; rather, it is sceptical about the claims of theoretical\nreason, in politics and ethics. Nor does its scepticism constitute a\ncritique of society in the Marxist sense. For conservatives, society\nrests on prejudice, not reason; prejudice is not irrational, but\nsimply unreasoning. Burke advocated educated prejudice as an antidote\nto its bigoted forms\u2014arguably, not a rejection of reason, but a\nscepticism about its inordinate pretensions. Philosophers might\nspeculate about why we have the duties that we do, but prejudice makes\nus act, without having to calculate all the consequences\u2014or\nindeed to reason about ends. This is not the irrationalism of\nNietzsche or Freud, for whom much of human behaviour is irrationally\ndriven, but rather, a non-rationalist standpoint. It is sceptical\nabout proposals of reform based on a priori commitment to a\nvalue such as freedom or equality. (See\n 2.3 on Burke\n below) In elucidating conservatism, one should distinguish between\nthe metaethical claim that abstract values do not exist or are not\nworth pursuing, and the epistemic challenge \u201chow are these\nvalues be accessed in practice?\u201d Conservatism is primarily an\nepistemic standpoint. Conservatives believe that values of justice,\nfreedom, and truth are important and should be pursued by the state,\nbut they interpret those values in a concrete fashion.\n",
