One question is whether\nGreen\u2019s ethics is dependent on his metaphysics and, if so, in\nwhat ways. Another question is about the priority, if any, between\nindividual and collective levels of self-consciousness and value.\n\nIs Green\u2019s perfectionist ethical theory dependent on his\nidealist metaphysics? If so, his perfectionism is hostage to his\nidealism, and doubts about his metaphysics may threaten his\nperfectionism. The Prolegomena to Ethics is Green\u2019s\nmost systematic work, and its structure might suggest that his\nperfectionist ethics of self-realization developed in Books II-IV rest\non the idealist metaphysics defended in Book I. Certainly, many\ninterpreters have accepted this kind of interdependence of\nGreen\u2019s metaphysics and ethics (e.g., Nicholson 2006, Armour\n2006, and Mander 2006). However, several of Green\u2019s writings in\npractical philosophy\u2014notably, the essay \u201cLiberal\nLegislation\u201d and his Lectures on the Principles of Political\nObligation\u2014are not preceded by elaborate metaphysical\ndiscussions or arguments for absolute idealism. Moreover, even if we\nlook at the Prolegomena, much of the argument against\nhedonism and in favor of perfectionism and the common good are\nintelligible and assessable without recourse to doctrines of absolute\nidealism. It\u2019s true that self-consciousness plays a crucial role\nin both epistemic and practical agency. If idealism meant nothing more\nthan the importance of self-consciousness to knowledge and moral\npersonality, that might provide a kind of unity to Green\u2019s\nmetaphysics and ethics. It would represent the crucial idealist\nmetaphysical claim as a comparatively modest and plausible one. But\nthose claims about the importance of self-consciousness do not require\nany specifically idealist metaphysical claims that reality is limited\nto what is or can be an object of consciousness. Indeed, we have seen\nthat there is a tension between Green\u2019s moral psychology and his\nidealist metaphysics. Green thinks that responsibility consists in\ncapacities for self-conscious reflection and assessment of one\u2019s\ndesires and options and that self-realization or perfection consists\nin the proper exercise of these reasons-responsive capacities.\nGreen\u2019s perfectionist ethics require that self-conscious minds\nplay this causal role in the will and action, and that is inconsistent\nwith the assumption in Green\u2019s idealist metaphysics that\nself-conscious minds lie outside of space and time (Irwin 2009:\n\u00a71235).\n\nAnother question about Green\u2019s metaphysics and ethics is the\nrelation between individual and collective levels of analysis.\nConsider the priority of individual and corporate consciousness in\nGreen\u2019s metaphysics. It is clear that the individual is prior in\norder of discovery. We begin by trying to understand an\nindividual\u2019s conscious experience and knowledge. This leads\nGreen to embrace local idealism, understood as the claim that reality\nor knowable reality cannot concern things as they are in themselves,\nindependently of how they do or can appear to individual thinkers.\nIndeed, discussion of an individual\u2019s experience and knowledge\noccupies the bulk of Book I of the Prolegomena. Green then\ninvokes the supposition that there is a single corporate consciousness\nof which individual consciousnesses are proper parts to avoid an\nincommensurable plurality of individual-specific realities and to\nexplain the possibility of objectivity. On one reading, individual\nidealism remains primary, not just in the order of discovery but also\nin the order of explanation and justification. Green thinks inquiry\nsupports individual idealism, and absolute idealism is a kind of\nphilosophical speculation about how one might try to ground\nobjectivity for individual consciousness. On another reading, Green\nmight think that though individual idealism is prior in the order of\ndiscovery to absolute idealism, reflection about the possibility of\nobjectivity shows that absolute idealism is prior in order of\nexplanation or justification. On this view, corporate or eternal\nconsciousness is the only substance and individual consciousness are\naccidents of this substance.\n\nThere are also interesting issues about the individual and collective\nlevels of analysis in Green\u2019s ethics. On the one hand, there is\na tendency to read the British idealists as anti-individualists, which\nmight seem to apply to Green (e.g., Berlin 1958, Quinton 1971). After\nall, there is the reading of his ethics on which it depends not just\non his idealism but also on his absolute idealism. Moreover,\nGreen\u2019s claims about the importance of individuals seeking a\npermanent good that transcends their individual limitations and about\nthe regulation of each person\u2019s good by a noncompetitive common\ngood might seem to support this anti-individualist reading.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a number of reasons to resist this\nanti-individualist reading of Green. First, as we have seen, it may\nnot be necessary or desirable to see Green\u2019s perfectionist\nethics as resting on his idealist metaphysics, much less his absolute\nidealism. Second, Green\u2019s claims about the importance of a\npermanent good and the common good may be defensible from\nindividualist premises. Book II of the Prolegomena begins\nwith a focus on individual practical agency and the personal good,\nmuch as Book I begins with a focus on individual epistemic agency and\nknowledge. Green argues that individuals have reason to see their own\ninterests extended by participation in larger projects in community\nwith others, and this, he claims, gives them reason to seek a common\ngood.\n\nWe can identify two different ways of linking the personal good and\nthe common good. One way is from the outside-in, arguing that\nthe common good is explanatorily prior to the personal good and that\nthe good of individuals is just whatever is contributory to the good\nof some collective, whether that be God, humanity, or some more local\ncommunity. Another way is from the inside-out, arguing that\nthe personal good is more complete when it includes the right sort of\nassociation with others and includes the pursuit of a common good.\nFramed this way, there\u2019s a strong case to be made for the\ninside-out reading of Green\u2019s ethics. As we\u2019ve seen, the\nstructure of the argument in Books II\u2013III of the\nProlegomena has this inside-out character. This\ninterpretation is reinforced by claims Green makes in his\n\u201cFreedom\u201d essay. Recall that Green identifies true freedom\nwith determination by practical reason and perfect self-realization.\nHe distinguishes between Christian (Pauline) and Kantian conceptions\nof freedom, on the one hand, and a Hegelian conception, on the other\nhand (Works II 312\u201315). The principal difference seems\nto be in whom freedom is realized. Green thinks that the Christian and\nKantian see the individual as the locus of freedom, whereas Hegel\ntreats the state as the locus of freedom. In this debate, Green sides\nwith the Christian and Kantian.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it would seem that we cannot significantly speak of\nfreedom except with reference to individual persons; that only in them\ncan freedom be realised; that therefore the realisation of freedom in\nthe state can only mean the attainment of freedom by individuals\nthrough influences which the state (in the wide sense spoken of)\nsupplies\u2014\u201cfreedom\u201d here, as before, meaning not mere\nself-determination which renders us responsible, but determination by\nreasons, \u201cautonomy of the will\u201d\u2026. (Works\nII 314)\n\n\nHere, Green makes explicit that he understands the link between the\npersonal good, freedom, and the common good from the inside-out.\n\nThis fits with a common observation about the traditions and\nindividuals who influenced Green. Perhaps the strongest influences are\nthe Greeks, especially Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel. It is not uncommon\nfor readers to emphasize the Hegelian dimensions of Green. But despite\nGreen\u2019s sympathy with some Hegelian commitments\u2014idealism,\na progressive view of history, and the importance of freedom\u2014his\nversion of these commitments and the ways he defends them show fairly\nlittle direct influence by\n Hegel.[10]\n Moreover, many of the most important elements of Green\u2019s\nperfectionism\u2014especially the ethics of self-realization, its\ngrounding in rational agency, and its concern with the common\ngood\u2014are traceable to the influence of Aristotle and Kant. It is\nperhaps not unreasonable to follow Sidgwick who regards Green\nprincipally as a Kantian (Lectures 3; Irwin 2009: \u00a71234)\nor, even better, Green\u2019s student D.G. Ritchie who suggests that\nit is perhaps best to say that Green \u201c\u2026 corrected Kant by\nAristotle and Aristotle by Kant\u201d (1891: 139\u2013140).\n",
