    "main_text": "Conceptual Matters\n1. Conceptual Matters\n\nIn analyzing gratitude and the conditions under which it is called\nfor, philosophers have generally tried to account for all the cases in\nwhich we find it natural to use gratitude terms\n(\u201cgrateful\u201d, \u201cthankful\u201d, etc.). We use such\nterms in a broad range of circumstances: it sounds natural to say, for\ninstance, \u201cI am grateful that it did not rain on my wedding\nday;\u201d \u201cgrateful someone happened to walk by as I was being\nmugged;\u201d \u201cgrateful to someone for trying unsuccessfully to\nhelp me;\u201d \u201cgrateful for someone\u2019s\nwell-wishes.\u201d The breadth of circumstances in which we invoke\ngratitude terms would suggest that gratitude, generally, is the\nresponse a person should have to something good\u2014that is, to\nbenefit or \u201cfavour\u201d (Walker 1980\u20131981).\n\nIn the last 40 years, philosophers have begun paying attention to a\nfundamental distinction in how we use gratitude terms (Walker\n1980\u20131981; Card 1988; McAleer 2012; Manela 2016a). On one hand,\nsuch terms can be used just before the preposition \u201cto\u201d,\nas in\n\nY is grateful to R for\n\u03c6-ing,\n\nwhere Y is some beneficiary, R is some benefactor,\nand \u03c6 is (at least paradigmatically) something R has done\nthat was beneficial for Y. Tony Manela (2016a) calls the\nattitude expressed by this type of locution prepositional\ngratitude. On the other hand, gratitude terms are sometimes followed\nby the word \u201cthat\u201d and a proposition, as in\n\nY is grateful that p, \n\nwhere p represents some state of affairs Y finds\nbeneficial. Sean McAleer (2012) calls the attitude expressed by this\ntype of locution propositional gratitude. Prepositional\ngratitude is essentially a \u201ctriadic\u201d or three-place\nrelation between Y, R, and \u03c6. Propositional\ngratitude, by contrast, is a \u201cdyadic\u201d or two-place\nrelation between Y and some good state of affairs p.\nPropositional gratitude is best understood as the proper response to a\ngood state of affairs. Prepositional gratitude, on the other hand, is\nthe proper response to something more specific: a benefactor\u2019s\ndoing or having done something beneficial for the beneficiary. Unlike\npropositional gratitude, prepositional gratitude is an essentially\ninterpersonal phenomenon.\n\nA consensus is emerging that analyses of the concept of gratitude\nshould be concerned only with the phenomenon expressed by the\nprepositional sense of the term (Carr 2013; Gulliford, Morgan et al.\n2013; Manela 2016a; Roberts and Telech 2019). The consensus is based\non the observation that the propositional sense of\n\u201cgratitude\u201d is more or less identical to another concept:\nthe concept called appreciation or gladness. To say\nthat I am grateful that it did not rain on my wedding day,\nfor instance, is just to say that I am glad it did not. To\nsay that I am grateful that my cancer went into remission is\njust to say I am glad that it did and that I\nappreciate the extra life and health that state of affairs\nentails. By contrast, to say I am grateful to a good\nSamaritan for saving my life implies more than that I am glad, or\nappreciate the fact, that I was saved by her. To be grateful\nto such a person seems to imply, for instance, a desire to\nsee her fare well, or a commitment to helping her out in the future,\nshould she ever find herself in dire circumstances. (Other ways in\nwhich appreciation and gratitude are different can be found in\n section 3.)\n As the good Samaritan case suggests, prepositional gratitude and\nappreciation are called for in many of the same situations. Indeed,\nappreciation may be called for in every situation in which\nprepositional gratitude is called for. But as the earlier examples\nsuggested, there are times when appreciation is called for but\ngratitude is not. Insofar as philosophers are interested in analyzing\ngratitude proper, without having their analyses contaminated by such\ncases of mere or bare appreciation, they should\nfocus their attention on all and only instances of the essentially\ninterpersonal kind of gratitude\u2014instances where a beneficiary is\ngrateful to a benefactor for something she did. In\nkeeping with this emerging consensus, the remaining sections of this\nentry will be concerned only with the concept of prepositional\ngratitude: the response called for in a beneficiary to a\nbenefactor\u2019s having done something beneficent for him.\n",
