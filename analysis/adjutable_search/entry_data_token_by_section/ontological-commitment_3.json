    "main_text": "Quantifier Accounts of Ontological Commitment || Quine's Criterion: Metalinguistic Versions\n1.4 Quine's Criterion: Metalinguistic Versions\nIf Quine is to avoid the problem of false existentials without\nexiting the theory of reference, he will need to resort to semantic\nascent. Ontological commitment to a kind K must somehow\ninvolve the predicate \u2018K\u2019. That will allow\nontological commitment to centaurs and ontological commitment to\nunicorns to be distinguished, even though \u2018centaur\u2019 and\n\u2018unicorn\u2019 are co-extensional. Indeed, Quine does suggest\n\u201cwithdrawing to a semantical plane\u201d when the ontological\ncommitments of the theory one is addressing outrun the ontological\ncommitments of one's own theory. He writes, referring to the\nontologically profligate philosopher McX: \n\nSo long as I adhere to my ontology, as opposed to McX's, I cannot\nallow my bound variables to refer to entities which belong to McX's\nontology and not to mine. I can, however, consistently describe our\ndisagreement by characterizing the statements which McX\naffirms. Provided merely that my ontology countenances linguistic\nforms, or at least concrete inscriptions and utterances, I can talk\nabout McX's sentences. (Quine 1948: 35)\n\nOne way of implementing this retreat to a semantical plane would be\nto interpret Quine's criterion as the following schema (with\n\u2018K\u2019 now a schematic letter ranging over\npredicates of the object language):\n\nQuine's Criterion, Metalinguistic Version.  A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to Ks\niff T logically entails \u2018\u2203x\nKx\u2019 iff, for every interpretation that\nmakes T true, there is some entity in the domain of the\ninterpretation that is in the extension of\n\u2018K\u2019.[7]\n\nIndeed, this captures some sense in which the truth\nof T requires that there be Ks among the values of\nthe variables. For example, any interpretation that makes\n\u2018\u2203x Unicorn(x)\u2019 true will have\nsome entity in its domain also be in the extension of\n\u2018Unicorn\u2019. This entity needn't be a unicorn, of\ncourse. But that's all to the good. It is the price one pays, the\nnon-believer in unicorns might say, if one wants to be able to say\nthat a theory is ontologically committed to unicorns.  But note that\nthe notion of ontological commitment is now entirely formal. Because\ninterpretations are generalized over, the actual interpretation of\n\u2018K\u2019 plays no role. Ontological commitment is\nessentially intra-linguistic, rather than a relation between language\nand the world. \nSuppose, for the moment, that one could live with the world being\nwell lost. There are still objections to the adequacy of the\nmetalinguistic\n criterion.[8] \nFirst, there is the problem that, in\nmaking entailment purely formal, all interconnections between kinds\nhave been lost: ontological commitment to bachelors won't carry with\nit ontological commitment to males; ontological commitment to\nelephants won't carry with it ontological commitment to\nanimals. There are no constraints on the joint interpretation of\n\u2018bachelor\u2019 and \u2018male\u2019, or of\n\u2018elephant\u2019 and \u2018animal\u2019. One can get these\nconnections back, however, by adding additional postulates\nto T, such as \u2018\u2200x(Bachelor(x)\n\u2283 Male(x))\u2019, or\n\u2018\u2200x(Elephant(x) \u2283\nAnimal(x))\u2019. (These might or might not be taken to be\nmeaning postulates, or metaphysically necessary postulates; for Quine\nthey would just be more theory.) This has the awkward result that the\noriginal theory T is not ontologically committed to males if\nit just contains \u2018\u2203x\nBachelor(x)\u2019, or to animals if it just contains\n\u2018\u2203x Elephant(x)\u2019; only T\nwith the postulates added is so committed. But perhaps one can live\nwith that.\nA second, more serious problem is that ontological commitment is\nentrapped in the object language: if \u2018K\u2019 is not\na predicate of the object language, we have no way of assigning\nontological commitment to Ks. Say that the explicit\nontological commitments of a theory are given by the existential\nsentences that the theory logically\nentails.[9] The\nmetalinguistic criterion above takes all ontological commitment to be\nexplicit ontological commitment. But ontological commitment can fail\nto be explicit\u2014or so it appears\u2014in one of two ways. A\ntheory may have implicit ontological commitments by\nentailing existential sentences or propositions according to some\nentailment relation more generous than logical entailment\n(see \u00a71.5\nand \u00a72). Or a theory may\nhave implicit ontological commitments by entailing\nexistential propositions that are not expressible in the language of\nthe theory. For example, a theory containing \u2018\u2203x\nElephant(x)\u2019, one might hold, is ontologically\ncommitted to animals, whether or not the language of the theory\ncontains the predicate \u2018Animal\u2019. A defender of the\nmetalinguistic criterion, however, should simply deny that there are\nimplicit ontological \ncommitments.[10] \nAs with the previous objection, we can\nenhance the theory by adding new predicates and new postulates\ninvolving the new predicates. Indeed, we can suppose that the object\nlanguage is as rich as the metalanguage with respect to\nnon-semantical predicates. Again, it is awkward to have to say that\nonly the enhanced theory in the enhanced language, not the original\ntheory in the original language, carries ontological commitment to\nanimals. But, again, perhaps we can live with that. (For more on the\nproblem of implicit commitment, see 1.7\nand \u00a72.1)\nThe real problem lies elsewhere. Although there is a sense in which\naccording to the criterion a theory that is ontologically committed\nto Ks must have Ks among the values of its\nvariables, it appears to be the wrong sense. If the\ninterpretation of \u2018K\u2019 is not held fixed, then the\nelements of the domain that are in the extension of\n\u2018K\u2019 have nothing to do with whether Ks\nexist, as \u2018K\u2019 is actually interpreted. It may\nseem a good thing that ontological commitment to unicorns has nothing\nto do with unicorns\u2014since there aren't any. But now ontological\ncommitment to elephants also has nothing to do with elephants, and\nthat's wrong. The ontological commitments of a theory should depend on\nthe meanings of its terms, not just on its logical form. Could one\ninstead go for a hybrid criterion, metalinguistic for empty kinds,\nextensional for non-empty kinds?  (This is suggested by Quine's talk\nof \u201cretreating to a semantical plane\u201d.) That would only\ncompound the problem. For then we could not know which criterion to\napply to a theory prior to knowing what exists, and the criterion\ncould not play a foundational role in ontology. \n",
