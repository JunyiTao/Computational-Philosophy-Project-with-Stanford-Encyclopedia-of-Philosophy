    "main_text": "Descartes, Augustine, and the Argument from Properties\n3. Descartes, Augustine, and the Argument from Properties\n\nMalebranche\u2019s philosophy generally owes much to the thought of\nDescartes and Augustine. This is particularly true in the case of\nVision in God, which bears a striking resemblance to Augustine\u2019s\ntheory of divine illumination, but which is also informed by Cartesian\nviews about the role of ideas in cognition and the intellectual\ncharacter of sensory perception. One way of gaining insight into the\ndoctrine of Vision in God then is by regarding it as a synthesis of\nDescartes and Augustine\u2019s philosophies of cognition. By\nintegrating their views, and using each as a corrective to the other,\nMalebranche produces a new doctrine that attempts to preserve and\nextend their philosophical insights while avoiding their limitations\nand problems.\n\nLet us pursue this inroad into Malebranche\u2019s theory of\ncognition, beginning with his Cartesian inheritance. Descartes is\noften read as holding a representative theory of perception, according\nto which our perception of material objects is mediated by ideas.\nIdeas are the immediate objects of perception and, via these ideas, we\nare able to perceive bodies in the world. He encourages such a reading\nin the Third Meditation, where he famously says that all ideas are\n\u2018as it were the images of things\u2019 (CSM 2:25, AT 7:37).\nDescartes explicitly denies that ideas are mental images;\nhowever, he suggests here that they are like images in the\nsense that they represent objects in the world.\n\nWhy would someone hold such a view, especially as it seems to violate\ncommonsense? In cases where I am looking directly at an object that is\nbefore me, such as a tree, I am inclined to think that what I perceive\ndirectly is the tree itself, not some ideational proxy for the tree.\nProponents of the representative theory, however, are often motivated\nby cases of non-veridical perception. In endorsing this theory\nhimself, Malebranche is no exception. When I hallucinate a pink\nelephant nothing in the world corresponds to my perception;\nnevertheless, my perception has an intentional character, i.e., it is\n\u2018of\u2019 or \u2018about\u2019 some object. Indeed,\nMalebranche maintains that all thought takes an object, on the grounds\nthat \u2018To see nothing is not to see; to think of nothing is not\nto think\u2019 (OCM 2:99, LO:320). Call this \u2018the principle of\nintentionality.\u2019 If, in hallucinating the pink elephant, there\nwere not some object of my hallucination I would not be having a\nperception at all. Ideas are introduced as a way of explaining how my\nperception can be intentional even in such cases. Absent a material\nthing, there must be some immaterial surrogate \u2013 call it an\n\u2018idea\u2019 \u2013 toward which my perception is immediately\ndirected.\n\nHaving established this result in the case of hallucinations, dreams,\nsensory illusions, etc., the representationalist must find a ground\nfor extending this conclusion to veridical perception. For in\nveridical perception the principle of intentionality could be\npreserved without appealing to ideas. One could say that the immediate\nobject of my perception is some material thing in the world.\nMalebranche eliminates this possibility by appealing to the principle\nthat all the immediate objects of perception must be of the same\nontological kind. One set of perceptions cannot have ideas as their\nobjects, while another set of perceptions is directed toward material\nthings. If non-veridical perceptions derive their intentional\ncharacter from being directed toward ideas, then so must all\nperceptions; otherwise this principle would be violated (see Nadler\n1992, 83).\n\nThe Argument from Properties: Establishing the representative\ntheory of perception is just one part of Malebranche\u2019s task in\ndefending the doctrine of Vision in God. Having argued that ideas are\nthe immediate objects of perception and thought, he must now deal with\na further question: \u2018where\u2019 are ideas? What is their\nlocus? Malebranche\u2019s answer of course is that ideas reside in\nGod, but in affirming this claim he is making his first important\nbreak with Descartes. It is fair to say that this is one place where\nMalebranche sees himself as correcting Descartes and using Augustine\nto do so. Descartes had taught that ideas are modifications of human\nminds. Indeed, Descartes would say that the ideas that figure most\nprominently in Malebranche\u2019s doctrine \u2013 viz. the\nidea of extension and the ideas of various mathematical objects\n\u2013 are innate, part of the very structure of the mind bestowed\nupon us by God. This means that Cartesian ideas are 1) finite mental\nitems and 2) created. Malebranche rejects both of these claims but,\nironically, he does so on grounds that appear to be at least partially\ninspired by Descartes\u2019 own writings.\n\nIn the Third Meditation, Descartes stresses that insofar as they\nrepresent things to us, ideas are real beings, even if the objects\nthey represent do not exist outside thought. The\n\u2018representational reality\u2019 of ideas falls short of the\nactual being of things in the world but, nevertheless, it is not\nnothing (AT 7:41, CSM 2:29). He reaffirms this point in the Fifth\nMeditation and adds that the ideas of various geometrical figures have\n\u2018immutable and eternal\u2019 essences, as is clear from the\nfact that these ideas resist efforts by our mind to deform them. For\nexample, once I have recognized that having angles equal to two right\nangles is part of the content of the idea of triangle, I am compelled\nto recognize this property \u2018whether I want to or not\u2019 (AT\n7:64, CSM 2:45). In general, Descartes holds that so-called\n\u2018clear and distinct ideas\u2019 are such that I cannot add\nanything to them or subtract anything from them (AT 7:51, 117\u20138;\nCSM 2:35, 83\u20134). Although he does not mention Descartes as his\nsource, Malebranche develops these points in a way that leads to some\nvery anti-Cartesian conclusions. He too wishes to stress that ideas\nare real beings and that they resist our mind\u2019s efforts to alter\nthem:\n\n\nI am thinking of a number, of a circle, of a room, of your chairs, in\na word, of particular beings. I am also thinking of being or of the\ninfinite, of undetermined being. All these ideas have some reality\nwhile I think of them. You do not doubt this, because nothingness has\nno properties and they do. (Dialogue 1, OC 12:37; JS:10)\n\nYou believe this floor exists because you feel it resist\nyou\u2026. But do you think your ideas do not resist you? Find me\nthen two unequal diameters in a circle, or three equal ones in an\nellipse. Find me the square root of eight and the cube root of\nnine\u2026. [M]ake two feet of intelligible extension equal no more\nthan one. Certainly the nature of this extension cannot countenance\nthat. It resists your mind. Do not, therefore, doubt its reality.\n(ibid., OC 12:41\u20132; JS:13\u201314)\n\n\nSo far, Malebranche has not said anything with which Descartes would\ndisagree: the fact that ideas have properties and resist our thought\ndemonstrates their reality. But Descartes also speaks of ideas as\n\u2018immutable and eternal.\u2019 Malebranche concurs with this as\nwell, and adds that they are \u2018necessary,\u2019\n\u2018universal,\u2019 and \u2018infinite\u2019. The idea of\nextension, for example, is \u2018necessary, eternal, immutable, and\ncommon to all minds\u2026.\u2019 (ibid., OC 12:42; JS:14) To say\nthat ideas are \u2018necessary\u2019 just means that \u2018it is\nimpossible that they should not be as they are,\u2019 and this is\nsomething that Malebranche thinks is discoverable in thought\n(Elucidation 10, OC 3:130; LO 614). Ideas are infinite in the sense\nthat they are \u2018inexhaustible.\u2019 One can discover in the\nidea of extension, for example, \u2018infinite numbers of\nintelligible triangles, tetragons, pentagons, and other such\nfigures,\u2019 as well as an infinite number of truths that can be\ndemonstrated of them (ibid.). The ideas of extension and the various\ngeometrical figures are also immutable (or unchanging) and eternal in\nthe sense that they did not come into being, and will not go out of\nbeing. And although cultural norms and tastes may vary among cultures,\nraces, and periods, the truths of mathematics are universal and common\nto all intelligences in the sense that all minds will, upon\nreflection, discover the same ones. Such truths are not the product of\nconvention but are intellectual givens that impose themselves on our\nthought.\n\nFrom the claim that ideas are necessary, eternal, immutable, etc.,\nMalebranche draws his first and most important anti-Cartesian\nconclusion, namely, that ideas must reside in God and be\n\u2018coeternal and consubstantial with Him\u2019 (Elucidation 10,\nOC 3:131; LO 614). Indeed, since Descartes affirms some or all of\nthese properties himself, consistency would seem to require that he\nabandon his view that ideas are created modes of finite minds. If\nideas are necessary and eternal then they cannot be created, as\ncreated things are contingent and have a beginning. Ideas also cannot\nbe modes of the soul, for \u2018it is clear that the soul\u2019s\nmodes are changeable but ideas are immutable; that its modes are\nparticular, but ideas are universal and general to all intelligences;\nthat its modes are contingent, but ideas are eternal and\nnecessary\u2026.\u2019 (Search, OC 2:103; LO 322\u20133).\nMalebranche expresses his positive conclusion at times by referring to\nGod once again as \u2018universal Reason\u2019 or the intelligible\nrealm of ideas:\n\nBut if it is true that the Reason in which all men participate is\nuniversal, that it is infinite, that it is necessary and immutable,\nthen it is certainly not different from God\u2019s own reason, for\nonly the infinite and universal being contains in itself an infinite\nand universal reason. All creatures are particular beings; universal\nreason, therefore, is not created. No creature is infinite; infinite\nreason, therefore, is not a creature. (Elucidation 10, OC 3:131;\nLO:614)\n\n\nAlthough he appears to draw these results from tensions within\nDescartes\u2019 theory of ideas, Malebranche finds additional support\nand inspiration for the doctrine of Vision in God in Augustine\u2019s\ntheory of divine illumination. Indeed, it is often said that Vision in\nGod combines Descartes\u2019 representationalism with an Augustinian\nor Neoplatonic ontology of ideas. The exact degree to which Augustine\ndirectly influenced Malebranche here, however, is difficult to gauge\nand one commentator has argued that the influence was minimal at most\n(See Connell 1967). That having been said, Malebranche often writes as\nif the lineage was direct and tends to minimize his philosophical\ndifferences with Augustine over the nature of cognition:\n\nIt therefore must be, as St. Augustine says in 500 hundred places,\nthat ideas are eternal, immutable, necessary, common to all souls, so\nthat there are most certainly truth and falsehood, justice and\ninjustice, eternal truths and laws; and that our souls are enlightened\nby the same ideas in consequence of the union that they have with this\nuniversal Reason which contains them all in its substance, which alone\nis the life and light of all intelligences\u2026. (OC 9:933)\n\n\nDespite what he regards as general agreement, Malebranche\ndifferentiates his view from Augustine\u2019s in two ways. First,\nwhereas Augustine spoke of seeing \u2018truths\u2019 in God,\nMalebranche speaks primarily of (immediately) seeing\n\u2018ideas.\u2019 This minor difference stems from\nMalebranche\u2019s tendency to privilege ideas and to understand\ntruth in terms of them. Truth is but a relation among ideas, though on\nhis scheme relations need not be anything real, over and above ideas,\nfor in perceiving any two ideas we can also grasp the relations\nbetween them.\n\nWe are of the opinion, then, that truths (\u2026 such as that twice\ntwo is four) are not absolute beings, much less that they are God\nHimself. For clearly, this truth consists only in the relation of\nequality between twice two and four. Thus, we do not claim, as does\nSaint Augustine, that we see God in seeing truths, but in seeing the\nideas of these truths \u2013 for ideas are real, whereas the\nequality between the ideas, which is the truth, is nothing\nreal \u2026. Thus, our view is that we see God when we see eternal\ntruths, and not that these truths are God, because the ideas on which\nthese truths depend are in God \u2013 it might even be that this was\nSaint Augustine\u2019s meaning. (Search 3.2.6, OC 1:444; LO\n234)\n\n\nMalebranche speaks rather baldly here. He seems to deny truths any\nreality whatsoever, but what he really wants is something weaker.\nElsewhere he draws a distinction between real relations like truth and\nimaginary relations such as falsehood. He denies reality only to the\nlatter, and wants to reduce real relations to ideas (Search\n6.1.5, OC 2:286; LO 433). Thus, the difference between Augustine and\nMalebranche on whether we directly perceive truths or ideas in God may\nbe only nominal, for Malebranche is not denying the reality of truths\nbut merely reducing them to ideas.\n\nSecond, and more significantly, Malebranche self-consciously extends\nAugustine\u2019s theory of divine illumination to material things.\nWhere Augustine limited his account to the intellectual apprehension\nof truths that are eternal and necessary, Malebranche conceives Vision\nin God as an all-encompassing theory of cognition that includes the\nsensory perception of sensible objects in the world. Malebranche\nbelieves that Augustine was prevented from seeing how the theory of\nillumination could be extended in this way as a result of two\nphilosophical prejudices. First, he maintained that we see bodies\ndirectly, without the aid of ideas. Second, like most philosophers\nprior to the scientific revolution he thought that colors, sounds,\npains, heat, and other sensory qualities are in bodies. But of course\nthese qualities change. If these two prejudices are combined, as\nMalebranche believed they were in Augustine\u2019s thinking, then to\nsay that we see material things in God would mean that God contains\nobjects that are changeable and corruptible. But this violates\nGod\u2019s immutability. Malebranche, however, thinks he has the\nresources for avoiding this result:\n\nWe further believe that changeable and corruptible things are known in\nGod, though Saint Augustine speaks only of immutable and incorruptible\nthings, because for this to be so, no imperfection need be placed in\nGod, since, as we have already said, it is enough that God should\nreveal to us what in Him is related to these things. (Search\n3.2.6, OC 1:444\u20135; LO 234)\n\n\nMalebranche is able to extend the scope of Augustine\u2019s theory of\nillumination as a result of what were then two recent philosophical\ndevelopments, courtesy of Descartes. First, the representational\ntheory of ideas allowed Malebranche to say that what we see directly\nin God are not changeable objects but ideas or essences. In the case\nof material things we see intelligible extension, which is immutable\nand incorruptible, in keeping with the divine nature. Second,\nMalebranche took from Descartes the view that colors and the other\nso-called \u2018secondary qualities\u2019 are not qualities of\nbodies but sensations or modifications of the mind (whether Descartes\nactually held this position himself is controversial). Since bodies do\nnot have these qualities, the idea of extension need not represent\nthem, and once again God is spared from having to accommodate\nchangeable entities. It is interesting to note here that by reducing\nsecondary qualities to sensations, Malebranche can also explain the\nvariations we see in the primary qualities of extension. Even if\nbodies are not colored, they still change their size, shape, motion,\nand position. How can intelligible extension represent those\nvariations without violating God\u2019s immutability? The answer is\nthat it need not, for as we have already discussed, color and light\nsensations \u2018particularize\u2019 extension and enable the mind\nto discriminate shapes and, correlatively, all the other primary\nqualities \u2013 sizes, positions, motions, etc. Sensations, then,\nare responsible for all the variations we see in material objects.\n",
