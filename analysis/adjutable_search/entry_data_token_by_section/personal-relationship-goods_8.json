    "main_text": "The Value of Personal Relationship Goods || Autonomy\n3.3 Autonomy\n\nCertain personal relationship goods have been argued to be\ninstrumentally valuable in a way that provides a direct reason for\ntheir universal provision: If we cannot develop autonomy without\nenjoying some of these goods, and if we owe individuals help to\ndevelop and preserve their autonomy, then all individuals are entitled\nto the personal relationship goods necessary for autonomy.\n\nAs we have seen, with respect to children the argument is\nstraightforward: it is difficult to see how one could acquire moral\nresponsibility, and eventually become fully autonomous, without close\nand ongoing relationships with moral mentors. As Virginia Held argues,\nit is the work of parents to create persons (Held 1993). But adults,\ntoo, have been said to require enough decent human constant in order\nto maintain their autonomy: if social deprivation is likely to\nseriously erode mental health, then it will eventually also undermine\nautonomy (Brownlee 2013). One illustration, often discussed by\nBrownlee (2013, forthcoming), is that of prisoners held in isolation\nwho sometimes end up preferring brutal interaction with interrogators\nto continued forced solitude. Even less than minimally decent\nrelationships seem desirable compared to the mental suffering, and\neventual psychological disintegration provoked by complete social\nisolation.\n",
