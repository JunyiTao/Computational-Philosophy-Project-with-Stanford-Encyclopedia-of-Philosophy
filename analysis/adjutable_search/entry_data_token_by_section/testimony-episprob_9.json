    "main_text": "Testimony and Evidence || Non-Evidential Views\n3.2 Non-Evidential Views\n\nInstead of further developing these evidential views, some\nepistemologists maintain that our testimonial-based beliefs are not\njustified by evidence. More specifically, some argue that testimonial\njustification should be understood in terms of non-evidential\nassurances, while others contend that it should be understood in terms\nof the reliability of the processes that produced the belief in\nquestion. Let us consider both of these positions in turn.\n3.2.1 The Assurance View\n\nAccording to proponents of the Assurance View (also called the\nInterpersonal View), the problem with all of the theories discussed\nabove is that they do not appreciate the epistemological significance\nof the interpersonal relationship that obtains between a speaker and\ntheir audience in a testimonial exchange. More specifically,\nconsider\n\n\nThe Assurance View: Because of the interpersonal relationship\nthat obtains in a testimonial exchange, if a hearer acquires\ntestimonial justification for believing that p on the basis of\na speaker\u2019s say-so, then the hearer\u2019s belief is justified,\nat least in\n part,[12]\n by the speaker\u2019s assurance, where this assurance is\nnon-evidential in nature. (A. Ross 1986; Hinchman 2005, 2014;\nMoran 2005, 2018; Faulkner 2007, 2011; Zagzebski 2012; and McMyler\n2011).\n\n\nIn order to get a handle on this view, there are two things that need\nunpacking here. First, how should we understand the nature of the\ninterpersonal relationship that is said to obtain in a testimonial\nexchange? And second, why is testimonial justification non-evidential\nin nature? Let us consider these questions in turn.\n\nFirst, proponents of the Assurance View maintain that the speech act\nof telling is key to understanding the relationship that a\nspeaker has with their audience. This is because when a speaker\ntells their audience that p is true, she is doing much\nmore than merely uttering p. Rather, she is inviting her\naudience to trust her that p is true; that is, she is assuring,\nor guaranteeing her audience that p is the case. More\nspecifically, in order for a hearer to acquire testimonial\njustification, the speaker must tell them that p is true, where\ntelling is understood along the following lines:\n\n\nTelling: S tells A that p iff\n\nA recognizes that S, in asserting that p,\nintends:\nthat A gain access to an epistemic reason to believe that\np,\nthat A recognize S\u2019s (ii)-intention, and\nthat A gain access to the epistemic reason to believe that\np as a direct result of A\u2019s recognition of\nS\u2019s (ii)-intention (Hinchman 2005: 567).\n\n\n\nThe idea is that when your friend testifies to you that the ice cream\nshop is open (= p), they are not merely uttering something;\nrather, they are telling you that p. And by telling\nyou that p, they are thereby assuring you that this\nreally is the\n case.[13]\n\nThus, when your friend tells you that p, i.e., when conditions\n(i)\u2013(iv) are satisfied, they have established an important,\ninterpersonal relationship with you, and you alone. This is because\nyou are the only one that has been assured by your friend that\np is true.\n\nIt is in this sense, then, that proponents of the Assurance View\nmaintain that there is an important interpersonal relationship that\nobtains between a speaker and their audience.\n\nThis brings us to the second key question about the Assurance View:\nEven if testimony should be understood in terms of the speech act of\ntelling, why does this mean that testimonial justification cannot be\nunderstood in terms of evidence?\n\nThe idea here is that when your friend tells you that p, they\nare assuring you that p is true, and that this assurance is\nwhat is justifying your belief. Moreover\u2014and this is the\nkey\u2014these assurances are non-evidential in nature.\n\nHere is one way that proponents of the Assurance View have argued for\nthis claim: a piece of evidence, e, counts in favor of a proposition,\np, regardless of what anyone intends (e.g., my fingerprint at\nthe ice cream shop is evidence that I was there regardless of whether\nI wanted to leave the print behind); but a speaker\u2019s assurance\nthat p only counts in favor of p because they intended\nit to, i.e., a speaker cannot unintentionally assure you of anything;\nthus, the assurances that justify your testimonial-based beliefs are\nnon-evidential in\n nature.[14]\n\nIt is for this reason, then, that proponents of the Assurance View\nmaintain that testimonial justification cannot be understood in terms\nof evidence.\n\nHowever, the Assurance View is not without problems of its own. One\nobjection is that it is unclear how these non-evidential assurances\ncan actually justify one\u2019s belief. For instance, suppose that\nonce again your friend tells you that the ice cream shop is\nopen (= p). But suppose that unbeknownst to both of you, Evelyn\nis eavesdropping on the conversation. Thus, while your friend does not\nissue Evelyn an assurance (namely because they do not intend for her\nto believe what they say and thus fail to satisfy conditions\n(i)\u2013(iv) in Telling), Evelyn clearly hears what your\nfriend says. Finally, suppose that you and Evelyn are equally reliable\nconsumers of testimony, that both of have the same background\ninformation about your friend, and that neither of you have any reason\nto doubt what your friend says on this occasion.\n\nThe key question here is this: Insofar as you and Evelyn both believe\nthat p because of what your friend said, epistemically\nspeaking, is there any sense in which your belief is better off than\nEvelyn\u2019s?\n\nGiven the details of the case, it is hard to see what the important\ndifference could be. Thus\u2014and herein lies the problem\u2014even\nthough you were issued an assurance and Evelyn was not, the assurance\nin question seems epistemically superfluous, i.e., it makes no\ndifference to the epistemic status of one\u2019s belief. Thus,\nproponents of the Assurance View must explain how assurances can\njustify one\u2019s beliefs, given that they seem epistemically inert.\n(This case comes from Lackey 2008. Owens 2006 and Schmitt 2010 raise\nsimilar worries).\n\nA second problem is that in order to make the case that testimonial\njustification is non-evidential in nature, proponents of the Assurance\nView have over-cognized what is involved in a testimonial\nexchange.\n\nTo see why, notice that Telling requires that the speaker and\nthe hearer both have the cognitive capacity to recognize that other\npeople have higher-order mental states, i.e., both parties\nmust be cognitively capable of recognizing that people have mental\nstates about other people\u2019s mental states. For instance, in\norder for you to satisfy all of the conditions in Telling,\nyou must believe (that your friend intends [that you\nbelieve (that your friend is intending [that you\nacquire an epistemic reason for belief because you recognizes that you\nfriend is intending to offer one)]). But decades of literature in\ndevelopmental psychology suggest that for neuro-typical children, the\nability to recognize that people have higher order mental states is\nnot acquired until around five or six years old. Moreover, this\nliterature also suggests that for people with autism, the ability to\ndo this is not acquired until much later in life, if it is acquired at\nall. Thus, insofar as young children and people with autism can\nacquire testimonial justification from their parents, say, then the\nAssurance View should be rejected on the grounds that it\nproblematically excludes these people from acquiring something of\nepistemic importance. See Leonard (2016).\n3.2.2 Testimonial Reliabilism\n\nTestimonial Reliabilists also deny that our testimonial-based beliefs\nare justified by evidence. But instead of claiming that they are\njustified by non-evidential assurances, the idea is that:\n\n\nTestimonial\n Reliabilism:[15]\n A hearer\u2019s testimonial justification consists in the\nreliability of the processes involved in the production of the\nhearer\u2019s testimonially-based belief. (See, e.g., Graham 2000a,\n2000b,\n 2006a;[16]\n Goldberg 2010a; and Sosa 2010).\n\n\nTo get a better handle on this view, suppose that your friend tells\nyou that the concert starts in an hour and that you thereby acquire\ntestimonial justification for believing that this is the case. In very\nbroad strokes, Testimonial Reliabilists can explain the nature of your\njustification as follows: When it comes to concerts, your friend\ntestifies truly almost all of the time; moreover, you are great at\ndifferentiating cases in which your friend is speaking honestly and\nwhen she is trying to deceive you; thus, you have testimonial\njustification in this case because the processes involved in the\nproduction and consumption of the testimony in question are highly\nreliable.\n\nIt is worth noting that there are at least two important processes\ninvolved in a testimonial exchange. First, there are the processes\ninvolved in the production of the speaker\u2019s testimony, i.e., the\nprocesses that are relevant to the likelihood that the testifier\nspeaks the truth. Second, there are the processes involved in the\nhearer\u2019s consumption of the testimony, i.e., the processes\ninvolved in the hearer being able to monitor for signs that what the\nspeaker says is false or unlikely to be true. For this reason,\nTestimonial Reliabilism can be developed in a number of importantly\ndifferent ways. For instance, one could opt for a view according to\nwhich a hearer\u2019s testimonial justification for believing that\np is only a matter of the reliability of the processes involved\nin the production of the speaker\u2019s say-so. Or, one could opt for\na view according to which testimonial justification only amounts to\nthe reliability of the processes involved in the hearer\u2019s\nconsumption of the speaker\u2019s testimony. Or, one could also opt\nfor a view according to which all of the relevant processes matter.\nSee Graham (2000a, 2000b, 2006a), Goldberg (2010a), and Sosa (2010)\nfor recent defenses of Testimonial Reliabilism, and see\n Section 4\n for additional versions of this view as well.\n\nTestimonial Reliabilism is motivated by the considerations that\nsupport Reliabilist theories of justification more generally, as well\nas its ability to avoid the problems that plague the views discussed\nabove. Nevertheless, opponents have argued that Testimonial\nReliabilism faces at least two problems of its own.\n\nFirst, insofar as there are at least two processes involved in a\ntestimonial exchange, Testimonial Reliabilists are faced with the\nsubstantial challenge of specifying which of these processes are\nrelevant to the hearer\u2019s testimonial justification, i.e.,\nTestimonial Reliabilists must give an account of which processes are\nrelevant here, and they must do so in a way that captures every\ninstance in which a hearer intuitively acquires testimonial\njustification from a speaker. (See Wright 2019, who argues that this\nis not merely an instance of the generality problem that poses a worry\nfor Reliabilist views of justification more generally).\n\nSecond, consider cases that involve one hearer and two\nsources of information. For instance, suppose that Rebecca, who\nis in fact a reliable testifier, tells you that traffic on I405 is\nbad. And suppose also that Umar, who is in fact an unreliable\ntestifier, tells you that traffic on I90 is all clear. Finally,\nsuppose that you do not have any reason to prefer one source of\ninformation over the other, i.e., for all you know, Rebecca and Umar\nare equally reliable testifiers.\n\nNow, consider the versions of Testimonial Reliabilism according to\nwhich the processes that are relevant to acquisition of testimonial\njustification are those that are involved in the speaker\u2019s\nproduction of the testimony in question, as well as the hearer\u2019s\nability to discern when the speaker is being sincere. It seems that\nthese Testimonial Reliabilists are committed to giving an\nasymmetric verdict in this case; that is, because the\nprocesses involved in the production of your belief based on\nRebecca\u2019s testimony are reliable, and because the processes\ninvolved in the production of your belief based on Umar\u2019s\ntestimony are not, this version of Testimonial Reliabilism is\ncommitted to the claim that while you do have testimonial\njustification for believing that the traffic on 1405 is bad, you do\nnot have testimonial justification for believing that I90 is all\nclear.\n\nHowever, opponents have argued that this verdict is highly\ncounterintuitive. After all, how could you possibly be justified in\nbelieving Rebecca\u2019s testimony but not Umar\u2019s, given that\nyou have no reason to think that the former is in any way better than\nthe latter? Thus, this version of Testimonial Reliabilism should be\nrejected. See Barnett (2015).\n3.3 Hybrid Views\n\nWe have seen that the evidential and non-evidential views discussed\nabove offer very different takes on how our testimonial-based beliefs\nare justified. We have also seen that while these views have their\nadvantages, they face some serious problems as well. Consequently,\nsome epistemologists have argued that testimonial justification cannot\nbe explained in a unified way. Instead, the strategy has been to offer\nhybrid views that combine various components of the accounts discussed\nabove.\n\nFor instance, some have tried to combine Reductionist and Reliabilist\ninsights such that testimonial justification consists partly in the\nhearer\u2019s evidence for accepting the speaker\u2019s testimony,\nand partly in terms of the speaker\u2019s and hearer\u2019s\nreliability at producing and consuming testimony respectively, e.g.,\nLackey (2008). Others have tried to combine insights from\nReductionism, Reliabilism and the Inheritance View such that a\nhearer\u2019s belief can be justified by their own evidence for\naccepting what the speaker says, or by the reliability of the\nspeaker\u2019s testimony, or by inheriting the evidence that is\npossessed by the speaker, e.g., Wright (2019). (For other hybrid\nviews, see Gerken 2013 and Faulkner 2000).\n\nMuch of the recent work on testimonial justification concerns whether\nthese hybrid views ultimately succeed, or whether they run into\nproblems of their own.\n4. Individualism and Anti-Individualism\n\nConsider\n\n\nFourth Big Question: Should testimonial justification be\nunderstood individualistically, or anti- individualistically?\n\n\nSome epistemologists endorse\n\n\nIndividualism: A complete account of testimonial\njustification can be given by appealing to features that only have to\ndo with the hearer.\n\n\nOther epistemologists endorse\n\n\nAnti-Individualism: A complete account of testimonial\njustification cannot be given by only appealing to features that have\nto do with the hearer.\n\n\nFor instance, according to some Anti-Individualists, acquiring\ntestimonial justification involves features having to do with both the\nhearer and the speaker. And according to other Anti-Individualists,\nacquiring testimonial justification involves features having to do\nwith both the hearer and the other speakers in the hearer\u2019s\nlocal environment. For various defenses of Anti-Individualism, see,\ne.g., Graham (2000b), Lackey (2008), Goldberg (2010a), Kallestrup and\nPritchard (2012), Gerken (2013), Pritchard (2015), and Palermos\n(forthcoming).\n\n(Note: In formulating these two views, I am being deliberately\nopen-ended about how the \u201cfeatures\u201d in question should be\nunderstood. As we will see below, this is because the debate between\nIndividualists and Anti-Individualists cuts across the other debates\nabout testimonial justification that we have explored above.\nConsequently, different members of each camp will want to give\nimportantly different takes on what these features amount to.)\n4.1 Individualism\n\nSuppose that Amanda tells Scott that the roller rink is open (=\np) and that Scott thereby acquires testimonial justification\nfor believing that p.\n\nTo get a grip on one version of Individualism, recall the Reductionist\nviews discussed in\n Section 1.1.\n According to Reductionists, testimonial justification consists in an\ninference that the hearer makes, i.e., the hearer\u2019s inference\nfrom the claim that (a) the speaker said that p to the\nconclusion that (b) p is true. Thus, Reductionists are\nIndividualists in the following sense: they maintain that whether or\nnot a hearer acquires testimonial justification for believing p\ndepends entirely on features having to do with the hearer, where these\nfeatures include, e.g., the hearer\u2019s perception of the speaker\nuttering p, the hearer remembering that testimony is generally\nreliable, and the hearer inferring on these grounds that what the\nspeaker said on this occasion is likely to be true.\n\nTo see a second version of Individualism, recall the our discussion of\nTestimonial Reliabilism in\n Section 3.2.2.\n According to some (but certainly not all) Testimonial Reliabilists,\ntestimonial justification should be understood Individualistically\nbecause it consists only in the reliability of the cognitive processes\nthat are internal to the hearer, i.e., the cognitive processes that\ntake place exclusively in the mind of the hearer herself. See Alvin\nGoldman (1979, 1986) and Alston (1994, 1995).\n\nWhile we have seen a variety of problems for both of these views\nabove, it is worth considering one challenge to this individualistic\nversion of Testimonial Reliabilism in particular. Doing so will not\nonly help shed light on why some Testimonial Reliabilists opt for an\nanti-individualistic view, it will also help illustrate how the debate\nabout Individualism and Anti-Individualism cuts across the other\ndebates we have considered above.\n\nTo begin, consider these two cases from Goldberg (2010a):\n\n\nGood: Wilma has known Fred for a long time; she knows\nthat he is a highly reliable speaker. So when Fred tells her that\nBarney has been at the stonecutters\u2019 conference all day, Wilma\nbelieves him. (Fred appeared to her as sincere and competent as he\nnormally does, and she found nothing remiss with the testimony.) In\npoint of fact, Fred spoke from knowledge.\n\nBad: Wilma has known Fred for a long time; she knows\nthat he is a highly reliable speaker. So when Fred tells her that\nBarney has been at the stonecutters\u2019 conference all day, Wilma\nbelieves him. (Fred appeared to her as sincere and competent as he\nnormally does, and she found nothing remiss with the testimony.)\nHowever, in this case, Fred did not speak from knowledge. Instead, he\nwas just making up a story about Barney, having had ulterior motives\nin getting Wilma to believe this story. (Fred has never done this\nbefore; it is out of his normally reliable character to do such a\nthing.) Even so, Fred\u2019s speech contribution struck Wilma here,\nas in the good scenario, as sincere and competent; and she was not\nepistemically remiss in reaching this verdict\u2026 As luck would\nhave it, though, Barney was in fact at the conference all day (though\nFred, of course, did not know this).\n\n\nContrasting these two cases motivates the following line of thought:\nIt seems like Wilma knows that Barney was at the stonecutters\u2019\nconference (= p) in Good but not in\nBad. It also seems like the cognitive processes that\nare internal to Wilma are the same across both cases. Thus, insofar as\njustification is what turns an unGettiered, true belief into\nknowledge, and insofar as Wilma\u2019s unGettiered, true belief that\np amounts to knowledge in Good but not in\nBad, the cognitive processes involved in the\nacquisition of testimonial justification cannot just be the ones that\nare internal to Wilma. Thus, Testimonial Reliabilists should not\nendorse Individualism. See Goldberg (2010a) for this argument.\n4.2 Anti-Individualism\n\nContrasting the Good and Bad cases\nhas motivated some Testimonial Reliabilists to endorse one version of\nAnti-Individualism. The core idea here is that insofar as testimonial\njustification should be understood in terms of the cognitive processes\nimplicated in the production of the hearer\u2019s belief that\np, the relevant processes must include both (a) the processes\ninvolved in the production of the speaker\u2019s testimony and (b)\nthe processes involved in the hearer\u2019s consumption of what the\nspeaker said. For instance, the cognitive processes internal to Wilma\nwere the highly reliable in both Good and\nBad, e.g., in both cases she was equally good at\nmonitoring for signs that Barney was being insincere. However, the\nprocesses internal to Barney that were implicated in his utterance\nthat p were reliable in Good (i.e., Barney\nspoke from knowledge) but unreliable in Bad (i.e.,\nBarney uttered that p in an attempt to be deceptive). Thus, by\ngiving an account of testimonial justification that requires both the\nspeaker and hearer to be reliable producers and consumers of testimony\nrespectively, Testimonial Reliabilists who endorse this\nAnti-Individualistic approach can explain why Wilma\u2019s belief\nseems better off in Good than it is in\nBad. (Goldberg [2010a] defends Anti-Individualism on\nthese grounds, and Graham (2000b) and Lackey (2008) also defend\nAnti-Individualistic views by requiring that in order for a hearer to\nacquire testimonial justification, not only does the hearer need to be\na reliable consumer of testimony, the speaker needs to be a reliable\ntestifier as well. Finally, Kallestrup and Pritchard (2012), Gerken\n(2013), Pritchard (2015), and Palermos (forthcoming) have recently\ndefended versions of Anti-Individualism according to which the\ntestifiers in the hearer\u2019s local environment need to be reliable\nin order for the hearer to acquire testimonial knowledge from the\nparticular speaker in question).\n\nTo see a second and importantly different version of\nAnti-Individualism, recall the Inheritance View from\n Section 3.1.2.\n On this view, when a hearer acquires testimonial justification for\nbelieving p, this is because they literally inherit the\njustification that the speaker has for believing p. Thus,\nproponents of the Inheritance View are Anti-Individualists in the\nfollowing sense: they maintain that whether or not a hearer acquires\ntestimonial justification for believing p crucially depends on\nfeatures having to do with the speaker, i.e., whether the speaker has\nany justification for the hearer to inherit.\n\nWhether or not either of these Anti-Individualistic approaches will\nultimately succeed is a topic of current debate.\n\nBefore moving on, it is worth noting that while we have been focusing\non testimonial justification, similar debates between\nIndividualists and Anti-Individualists can be had about testimonial\nknowledge. While many epistemologists endorse Individualism\n(Anti-Individualism) about both justification and knowledge, one need\nnot do so. For instance, Audi (1997) endorses Reductionism about\njustification and the Transmission View about knowledge. On this\npicture, then, Individualism is true with respect to justification\nbecause whether or not a hearer acquires testimonial justification\ndepends solely on the inferences that they make. However,\nAnti-Individualism is true with respect to knowledge because in order\nfor a hearer to acquire testimonial knowledge that p, the\nspeaker must also know that p. Keeping these distinctions in\nmind further illustrates how the debate between Individualists and\nAnti-Individualists cuts across so many of the other debates we have\nseen above.\n5. Authoritative Testimony\n\nHere is a conversation that we might have:\n\n\nYou: This plant is Pacific Poison Oak. Don\u2019t touch it!\nMe: How do you know that?\nYou: Suneet told me. He lives in this area a knows a little bit\nabout plants.\n\n\n\nAnd here is another:\n\n\nYou: This plant is Pacific Poison Oak. Don\u2019t touch it!\nMe: How do you know that?\nYou: Margae told me. She has a PhD in plant biology and studies\nthis plant in particular.\n\n\n\nIn both cases you have acquired testimonial knowledge. But in the\nsecond case it seems like your belief is better off, epistemically\nspeaking. This is because in the first case your belief is based on\nthe testimony of a layman who is somewhat knowledgeable about the\ntopic at hand, whereas in the second case your belief is based on the\ntestimony of an epistemic authority (or, someone who is both\nyour epistemic superior and an expert about the domain in question).\n(See Zagzebski 2012; J\u00e4ger 2016; Croce 2018; and Constantin &\nGrundmann 2020 for more on how the notion of an epistemic authority\nshould be understood.)\n\nBut how exactly should the difference between epistemic authorities\nand everyone else be accounted for?\n\nBroadly speaking, those working on the epistemology of authoritative\ntestimony endorse one of two accounts: Preemptive Accounts\nand Non-Preemptive Accounts. Those who endorse a Preemptive\nAccount of authoritative testimony accept\n\n\nPreemption: The fact that an authority\u2026 [testifies]\nthat p is a reason for me to believe that p which\nreplaces my other reasons relevant to p and is not simply added\nto them. (Zagzebski 2012: 107)\n\n\nThe key idea here is that when you get testimony from an authority\nthat p, the authority\u2019s testimony is now the only reason\nthat you have for believing p, i.e., any other reasons you may\nhave had are now preempted in the sense that they no longer count for\nor against p. Proponents of the Preemptive Account, then,\nexplain the difference between authoritative and non-authoritative\ntestimony as follows: Authoritative testimony can provide you with a\npreemptive reason for belief, whereas non-authoritative testimony\ncannot. For defenses of various versions of the Preemptive Account,\nsee Zagzebski (2012, 2014, 2016), Keren (2007, 2014a, 2014b), Croce\n(2018) and Constantin and Grundmann (2020). See Anderson (2014),\nDougherty (2014), J\u00e4ger (2016), Dormandy (2018), and Lackey\n(2018a) for some worries with this view.\n\nThose who endorse a Non-Preemptive Account of authoritative testimony\nargue that Preemption has wildly unintuitive consequences, e.g., if\nPreemption is true, then you can be justified in believing your pastor\n(who is otherwise reliable) when he tells you that women are\ninherently inferior to men (see, e.g., Lackey 2018a). Instead of\nthinking about authoritative testimony as providing preemptive reasons\nfor belief, proponents of the Non-Preemptive Account take an\nauthority\u2019s testimony that p to provide a very strong\nreason to believe that p, where this reason is to be added to,\nor combined with, all of the other reasons that you have related to\nthe proposition in question. See Dormandy (2018) and Lackey (2018a)\nfor defenses of Non-Preemptive Accounts.\n\nFor related debates about testimony and expertise, see Hardwig\u2019s\n(1985) seminal paper on expert testimony in general, Alvin\nGoldman\u2019s (2001) paper on determining which experts to trust\nwhen there is disagreement amongst them, and Goldberg\u2019s (2009)\npaper that links issues in epistemology and philosophy of language by\ndiscussing how expert testimony bears on the semantics of technical\nterms. See also Kitcher (1993), Walton (1997), Brewer (1998) and\nGolanski (2001) for a discussion of expert testimony in the scientific\nsetting, and for discussion of expert testimony in a legal setting,\nsee Wells and Olson (2003).\n6. Group Testimony\n\nWhile much attention has been paid to issues surrounding\nindividual testimony, i.e., cases in which one speaker tells\nsomeone that p is true, recently epistemologists have started\nexploring a number of related questions regarding group\ntestimony, i.e., cases in which a group testifies to someone that\np is true. Here is one case that motivates this line of\nresearch.\n\n\nPopulation Commission: Consider the UN Population\nCommission that was established by the Economic and Social Council of\nthe United Nations in 1946. The Commission was designed to assist the\ncouncil by arranging studies and advising the council on population\nissues, trends, developments, policies, and so on. It is also charged\nwith monitoring the implementation of policies designed by the United\nNations to regulate population and to provide recommendations to the\ncouncil and United Nations as a whole. The commission is composed of\n47 members with a representative from almost every country in the\nUnited Nations. In 2002, the Commission released a report entitled\nCharting the Progress of Populations that provides information on 12\nsocio-economic indicators, including total population, maternal\nmortality, infant mortality, and so on. (Tollefsen 2007:\n300\u2013301)\n\n\nThere are three things to notice here. First, consider a particular\nclaim in the Charting the Progress of Populations report. For\ninstance, let p be the claim that\n\n\nWhile the population in North America has risen, the population in\nCentral America has stayed the same, and the population in South\nAmerica has declined.\n\n\nAt the time the report was released, no single member of the UN\nPopulation committee believed p. That is, none of the committee\nmembers were aware that p was true until the report was\nreleased and they read it for themselves.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, before the report was released, none of the\ncommittee members had any evidence, or justification, for believing\np. That is, while some members might have justifiably believed\nthat the population in North America was on the rise, and while others\nmight have justifiably believed that the population in South America\nwas on the decline, and while others still might have justifiably\nbelieved that the population in Central America had stayed the same,\ngiven the way in which the labor was divided amongst the researchers,\ni.e., given that none of them had communicated their findings with one\nanother, nobody had justification for thinking that p itself\nwas true until after the report came out.\n\nThird, and finally, the UN Commission did seem to testify that\np, i.e., their report did contain the group\u2019s testimony\nabout the population changes in the Americas.\n\n(Of course, this is not the only case that motivates the need for an\nepistemology of group testimony. Wikipedia, for instance,\npresents a number of interesting questions about what it would take\nfor a group to testify, and when and why we should accept what a group\nsays. See, e.g., Tollefsen 2009; Wray 2009; and Fallis 2008. Cases\ninvolving testimony from scientific groups also raise similar issues.\nSee, e.g., Hardwig 1985 and Faulkner 2018).\n\nCases like this give rise to at least five important questions. First,\nconsider\n\n\nHow should we understand the relationship between a group\u2019s\ntestimony that p and the testimony of the group\u2019s\nindividual members?\n\n\nOn the one hand, Summativists maintain that a group\u2019s\ntestimony that p should be understood in terms of the testimony\nof some (or most, or all) of its members. On the other hand,\nNon-Summativists maintain that it is possible for a group to\ntestify that p even if none of its members do. (See Tollefsen\n(2007) and Lackey (2014) for a defense of different Non-Summative\npositions).\n\nRelatedly, Deflationists maintain to a group\u2019s\ntestimony that p can be reduced to some individual\u2019s\ntestimony that p (regardless of whether those individuals are\nmembers of the group, or just mere spokesmen), whereas\nInflationists maintain that a group itself can be a\ntestifier. (See Tollefsen (2007) for a defense of the latter, and see\nLackey\u2019s (2014) for a deflationary account of the epistemology\nof group testimony and her (2018a) for an inflationary account of the\nnature of group assertion).\n\nSecond, consider\n\n\nUnder what conditions is a hearer justified in believing a\ngroup\u2019s testimony that p?\n\n\nThe debate surrounding this question is analogous to the\nReductionist/Anti-reductionist debate about individual testimony in\n Section 1.\n See Tollefsen (2007) for a defense of a reductionist view.\n\nThird, consider\n\n\nIf you are justified in believing that p on the basis of a\ngroup\u2019s testimony, is your belief justified by\nevidence?\n\n\nThe debate surrounding this question is analogous to the debates about\nindividual testimony discussed in\n Section 3.\n For instance, suppose that you are justified in believing that\np on the basis of a group\u2019s testimony that p.\nMiranda Fricker (2012) defends an Assurance View according to which\nyour belief is justified by the group\u2019s assurance that p\n(but see Faulkner (2018) for a criticism of this view). Lackey (2014)\ndefends a reliabilist account according to which your belief is\njustified by the reliability (or truth conduciveness) of the\ngroup\u2019s statement that p (but see Faulkner (2018) for a\ncriticism of this view too). Finally, Faulkner (2018) defends a\nqualified Inheritance View according to which your belief that\np can be justified by the justification that the group has (or\nat least has access to).\n\nFourth, consider,\n\n\nCan group testimony generate knowledge, or can it merely transmit\nit?\n\n\nThe debate surrounding this question is analogous to the debates about\nindividual testimony in\n Section 2.\n On the one hand, Faulkner (2018) defends a qualified Transmission\nView according to which you can only acquire testimonial knowledge and\njustification from a group\u2019s testimony that p if that\ngroup has, or at least has access to, a body of justification\nthat supports p. On the other hand, Lackey (2014) defends a\nview that is compatible with a group\u2019s testimony generating\nknowledge and justification.\n\nFifth, and finally, consider,\n\n\nWhat, if anything, does a group\u2019s testimony that p\nentail about that group\u2019s knowledge (and thus belief) that\np?\n\n\nMore specifically, suppose that a group testifies that p and\nthat you come to know that p on this basis. Does the fact that\nyou acquired testimonial knowledge in this case entail that groups\nthemselves can be knowers (and thus believers)?\n\nOn the one hand, John Hardwig (1985) argues for a positive answer\nhere. That is, Hardwig argues that if we acknowledge that groups can\ntestify, we should also acknowledge that groups themselves can be\nknowers, and thus believers too (see also Lackey (2016) for an\nargument to the effect that groups can possess justified beliefs). On\nthe other hand, Faulkner (2018) argues against this line of thought\nand suggests that even if groups can testify, this does not entail\nthat they possess any mental states.\n\nOf course, there is much more work that can, and should, be done about\nthe epistemological significance of receiving testimony from\ngroups.\n7. The Nature of Testimony Itself\n\nUntil now we have been operating with an intuitive but inexact notion\nof what counts as testimony, i.e., for the most part, we have just\nbeen looking at cases in which speakers say stuff. But how exactly\nshould the speech act of testimony be understood? That is, how should\ntestimony be individuated from the other things that one can do with\ntheir words?\n\nOne answer is that testimony should simply be identified with\nassertion, i.e., one testifies that p if, and only if, one\nasserts that p. (E. Fricker 1987 and Sosa (1994) offer passing\nremarks in defense of this position). But while it is widely accepted\nthat one must assert that p in order to testify that p,\nthere is much debate about whether asserting that p is\nsufficient for testifying that p. (See Goldberg 2010b, though,\nwho argues that asserting that p is not even necessary for\ntestifying that p, and see the entry on Assertion for more\nabout how this speech act should be understood).\n\nFor instance, in addition to asserting that p, one influential\naccount maintains that in order to testify that p, the\nfollowing conditions must also be met:\n\n\nTestimony: S testifies by making some statement that p\nif and only if:\n\n(T1)\nS\u2019s stating that p is evidence that p\nand is offered as evidence that p.\n(T2)\nS has the relevant competence, authority, or credentials to\nstate truly that p.\n(T3)\nS\u2019s statement that p is relevant to some\ndisputed or unresolved question (which may or may not be whether\np) and is directed to those who are in need of evidence on the\nmatter. (Coady 1992: 42).\n\n\n\nHowever, opponents have objected to each of T1\u2013T3. Here is just\none example. Some have rejected T1 on the grounds that one can testify\nthat p even though the testimony itself does not provide the\nhearer with any evidence that p is true, e.g., if I tell you\nthat humans spontaneously combust all the time, and insofar as you\nknow that I am wildly unreliable about this issue, it seems like I\nhave testified to you even though my testimony provides no evidence\nwhatsoever for the proposition in question. (See E. Fricker (1995) and\nLackey (2008). See Lackey (2008: Ch. 1) for a discussion of other\nproblems with this view).\n\nIn light of worries like these, many authors have offered alternative\ntakes on how testimony should be characterized. For instance, E.\nFricker (1995: 396\u20137) argues that testimony should just be\nunderstood in a very general sense, with \u201cno restrictions either\non the subject matter, or on the speaker\u2019s epistemic relation to\nit.\u201d (See also Audi (1997) and Sosa (1991) for views in this\nballpark). And, as we saw in\n Section 3.2.1,\n proponents of the Assurance View understand testimony in terms of\nTelling.\n\nGraham (1997: 227) offers a different account of testimony based on\nconveying information, i.e., a speaker, S, testifies that\np if, and only if, (i) S\u2019s stating that p\nis offered as evidence that p (ii) S intends that his\naudience believe that he has the relevant competence, authority, or\ncredentials to state truly that p and (iii) S\u2019s\nstatement that p is believed by S to be relevant to some\nquestion that he believes is disputed or unresolved (which may or may\nnot be whether p) and is directed at those whom he believes to\nbe in need of evidence on the matter. (J. Ross 1975 and Elgin (2002)\nalso offer accounts that crucially hinge on the speaker\u2019s\nstatement purporting to convey information).\n\nAnd Lackey (2008: 30\u201332) offers a disjunctive account of\ntestimony according to which we need to distinguish between\nspeaker testimony and hearer testimony as\nfollows.\n\n\nSpeaker Testimony: S s-testifies that p by\nperforming an act of communication a if and only if, in\nperforming a, S reasonably intends to convey the\ninformation that p (in part) in virtue of a\u2019s\ncommunicable content.\n\nHearer Testimony: S h-testifies that p by\nmaking an act of communication a if and only if H,\nS\u2019s hearer, reasonably takes a as conveying the\ninformation that p (in part) in virtue of a\u2019s\ncommunicable content.\n\n\nOne upshot of this disjunctive account is that it captures the sense\nin which testimony is often an intentional act performed by the\nspeaker, as well as the sense in which testimony is a source of\nknowledge and justified belief regardless of what the speaker intended\nto say.\n\nRegardless of how testimony itself should be understood, all of these\nauthors agree that it is possible to learn from the testimony of\nothers. As we have seen, though, explaining how it is that we can\nlearn from what other people tell us has proven to be a difficult\ntask.",
