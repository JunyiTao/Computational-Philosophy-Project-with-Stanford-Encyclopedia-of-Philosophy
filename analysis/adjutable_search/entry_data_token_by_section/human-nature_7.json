    "main_text": "The Nature of the Evolutionary Unit Homo sapiens and its Specimens || Responding to the Evolutionary Verdict on Classificatory Essences\n2.3 Responding to the Evolutionary Verdict on Classificatory Essences\n\nThe lack of a \u201chuman essence\u201d in the sense of intrinsic\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for belonging to the species taxon\nHomo sapiens, has led a number of philosophers to deny that\nthere is any such thing as human nature (Hull 1984: 19; 1986; Ghiselin\n1997: 1; de Sousa 2000). As this negative claim concerns properties\nintrinsic both to relevant organisms and to the taxon, it is equally\ndirected at the \u201cnature\u201d of the organisms as species\nspecimens and at that of the species taxon itself. An alternative\nconsists in retracting the condition that a classificatory essence\nmust be intrinsic, a move which allows talk of a historical or\nrelational essence and a corresponding relational conception of\ntaxonomic human nature (Okasha 2002: 202).\n\nWhich of these ways of responding to the challenge from evolutionary\ntheory appears best is likely to depend on how one takes it that the\nclassificatory issues relate to the other matters at stake in the\noriginal human nature package. These concern the explanatory and\nnormative questions raised by TP1\u2013TP4. We turn to these in the\nfollowing three sections of this article.\n\nAn exclusively genealogical conception of human nature is clearly not\nwell placed to fulfil an explanatory role comparable to that envisaged\nin the traditional package. What might have an explanatory function\nare the properties of the entities from which the taxon or its\nspecimens are descended. Human nature, genealogically understood,\nmight serve as the conduit for explanations in terms of such\nproperties, but will not itself explain anything. After all,\nintegration in a network of sexual reproduction will be partly\ndefinitive of the specimens of all sexual species, whilst what is to\nbe explained will vary enormously across taxa.\n\nThis lack of fit between classificatory and explanatory roles\nconfronts us with a number of further theoretical possibilities. For\nexample, one might see this incompatibility as strengthening the\nworries of eliminativists such as Ghiselin and Hull: even if the\nsubtraction of intrinsicality were not on its own sufficient to\njustify abandoning talk of human nature, its conjunction with a lack\nof explanatory power, one might think, certainly is (Dupr\u00e9\n2003: 109f.; Lewens 2012: 473). Or one might argue that it is the\nclassificatory ambitions associated with talk of human nature that\nshould be abandoned. Once this is done, one might hope that certain\nsets of intrinsic properties can be distinguished that figure\ndecisively in explanations and that can still justifiably be labelled\n\u201chuman nature\u201d (Roughley 2011: 15; Godfrey-Smith 2014:\n140).\n\nTaking this second line in turn raises two questions: first, in what\nsense are the properties thus picked out specifically\n\u201chuman\u201d, if they are neither universal among, nor unique\nto species specimens? Second, in what sense are the properties\n\u201cnatural\u201d? Naturalness as independence from the effects of\nhuman intentional action is a key feature of the original package\n(TP1). Whether some such conception can be coherently applied to\nhumans is a challenge for any non-classificatory account.\n",
