    "main_text": "\n\nThe Vienna Circle was a group of early twentieth-century philosophers\nwho sought to reconceptualize empiricism by means of their\ninterpretation of then recent advances in the physical and formal\nsciences. Their radically anti-metaphysical stance was supported by an\nempiricist criterion of meaningfulness and a broadly logicist conception of\nmathematics. They denied that any principle or claim was synthetic\na priori. Moreover, they sought to account for the\npresuppositions of scientific theories by regimenting such theories\nwithin a logical framework so that the important role played by\nconventions, either in the form of definitions or of other analytical\nframework principles, became evident. The Vienna Circle\u2019s\ntheories were constantly changing. In spite (or perhaps because) of\nthis, they helped to provide the blueprint for analytical philosophy\nof science as meta-theory\u2014a \u201csecond-order\u201d\nreflection of \u201cfirst-order\u201d sciences. While the Vienna\nCircle\u2019s early form of logical empiricism (or logical positivism\nor neopositivism: these labels will be used interchangeably here) no\nlonger represents an active research program, recent history of\nphilosophy of science has unearthed much previously neglected variety\nand depth in the doctrines of the Circle\u2019s protagonists, some of\nwhose positions retain relevance for contemporary analytical\nphilosophy.\n",
