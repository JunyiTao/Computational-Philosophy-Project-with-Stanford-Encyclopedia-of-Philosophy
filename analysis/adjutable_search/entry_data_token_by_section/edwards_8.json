    "main_text": "Epistemology || Sanctified Reason\n4.2 Sanctified Reason\n\nEdwards thinks that reason can prove that God exists, establish many\nof his attributes, discern our obligations to him, and mount a\nprobable case for the credibility of scripture. But he also believes\nthat grace is needed both to help the natural principles\n\u201cagainst those things that tend to stupefy [them] and to hinder\n[their] free exercise,\u201d and to sanctify \u201cthe reasoning\nfaculty and\u201d assist \u201cit to see the clear evidence there is\nof the truth of religion in rational arguments\u201d\n(\u201cMiscellanies,\u201d nos. 626, 628; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol.\n18, 155, 156f).\n\nHis view is briefly this. \u201cActual ideas\u201d are ideas that\nare lively, clear, and distinct. Thought has a tendency to substitute\n\u201csigns\u201d (i. e., words or images) for actual ideas. While\nthis tendency is useful and normally quite harmless, it impedes\nreasoning when \u201cwe are at a loss concerning a connection or\nconsequence [between ideas], or have a new inference to draw, or would\nsee the force of some new argument\u201d (\u201cMiscellanies,\u201d\nno. 782; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 18, 457). Since accurate reasoning\nabout a subject matter requires attending to actual ideas of it, one\ncan't accurately reason about religion if one lacks the relevant actual\nideas. To have an actual idea of God, for example, one must have\nactual ideas of the ideas that compose it. But most of us don't. Those\nparts of the idea of God that everyone has (ideas of knowledge, power,\nand justice, for instance) either aren't attended to or, if they are,\nfail to elicit the appropriate affective reaction. In addition, we\ncan't fully understand ideas of affections which we haven't\nexperienced and so can't properly understand God's benevolence if we\naren't benevolent ourselves. And without the simple idea of true\nbeauty, one can understand neither God's holiness nor the facts that\ndepend on it.\n\nTrue benevolence remedies these deficiencies. Because the desires of\nthe truly benevolent are properly ordered, they attend to ideas of\nreligion and are suitably affected by the ideas of God's attributes\nand activities that everyone has. (They fear his wrath, for example,\nand are grateful for his benefits.) Furthermore, they understand God's\nbenevolence because their own benevolence mirrors it. Finally, the\ntruly benevolent delight in the benevolence in which holiness\nconsists, i.e., they \u201cperceive\u201d or \u201ctaste\u201d or\n\u201crelish\u201d its beauty. Edwards' claim, then, is that to\nreason accurately about God one must have an actual idea of him, and\nto have that one must be truly benevolent. Right reasoning about\nreligious matters requires right affections.\n\nEdwards is an evidentialist. Rational religious beliefs are either\nproperly basic or rest on good evidence. A belief that the gospel\nscheme exhibits true beauty is an example of the former. But most\nreligious beliefs depend on evidence. Sometimes this evidence includes\nthe idea of true beauty. Even when it does not, however, the right\naffections are needed to appreciate its force. In either case, only\nthose with properly disposed hearts can read the evidence\ncorrectly.\n",
