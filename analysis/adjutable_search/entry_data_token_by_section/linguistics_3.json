    "main_text": "Three Approaches to Linguistic Theorizing: Externalism, Emergentism, and Essentialism || The Essentialists\n1.3 The Essentialists\n\nIf Leonard Bloomfield is the intellectual ancestor of Externalism, and\nSapir the father of Emergentism, then Noam Chomsky is the intellectual\nancestor of Essentialism. The researcher with predominantly\nEssentialist inclinations aims to identify the intrinsic properties of\nlanguage that make it what it is. For a huge majority of practitioners\nof this approach\u2014researchers in the tradition of\ngenerative grammar associated with Chomsky\u2014this\nmeans postulating universals of human linguistic structure, unlearned\nbut tacitly known, that permit and assist children to acquire human\nlanguages. This generative Essentialism has a preference for finding\nsurprising characteristics of languages that cannot be inferred from\nthe data of usage, and are not predictable from human cognition or the\nrequirements of communication.\n\nRather than being impressed with language variation, as are\nEmergentists and many Externalists, the generative Essentialists are\nextremely impressed with the idea that very young children of almost\nany intelligence level, and just about any social upbringing, acquire\nlanguage to the same high degree of mastery. From this it is inferred\nthat there must be unlearned features shared by all languages that\nsomehow assist in language acquisition.\n\nA large number of contemporary Essentialists who follow\nChomsky\u2019s teaching on this matter claim that semantics and\npragmatics are not a central part of the study of language. In\nChomsky\u2019s view, \u201cit is possible that natural language has\nonly syntax and pragmatics\u201d (Chomsky 1995: 26); that is, only\n\u201cinternalist computations and performance systems that access\nthem\u201d; semantic theories are merely \u201cpart of an interface\nlevel\u201d or \u201ca form of syntax\u201d (Chomsky 1992:\n223).\n\nThus, while Bloomfield understood it to be a sensible practical\ndecision to assign semantics to some field other than linguistics\nbecause of the underdeveloped state of semantic research, Chomsky\nappears to think that semantics as standardly understood is not part\nof the essence of the language faculty at all. (In broad outline, this\nexclusion of semantics from linguistics comports with Sapir\u2019s\nview that form is linguistic but content is cultural.)\n\nAlthough Chomsky is an Essentialist in his approach to the study of\nlanguage, excluding semantics as a central part of linguistic theory\nclearly does not follow from linguistic Essentialism (Katz 1980\nprovides a detailed discussion of Chomsky\u2019s views on semantics).\nToday there are many Essentialists who do hold that semantics\nis a component of a full linguistic theory.\n\nFor example, many linguists today are interested in the\nsyntax-semantics interface\u2014the relationship between the surface\nsyntactic structure of sentences and their semantic interpretation.\nThis area of interest is generally quite alien to philosophers who are\nprimarily concerned with semantics only, and it falls outside of\nChomsky\u2019s syntactocentric purview as well. Linguists who work in\nthe kind of semantics initiated by Montague (1974) certainly focus on\nthe essential features of language (most of their findings appear to\nbe of universal import rather than limited to the semantic rules of\nspecific languages). Useful works to consult to get a sense of the\nmodern style of investigation of the syntax-semantics interface would\ninclude Partee (1975), Jacobson (1996), Szabolcsi (1997), Chierchia\n(1998), Steedman (2000).\n",
