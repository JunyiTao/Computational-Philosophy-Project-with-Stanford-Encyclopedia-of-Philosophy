Quidditative Knowledge of God and the Divine Attributes\n\n\nIn Quodlibet VII, q. 11 Godfrey considers the view of some,\npresumably Thomas Aquinas, who say that in this life we can know that\nGod is, but not what he is. Godfrey makes a clear but implicit\nreference to ST I, q. 3, a. 4 where Thomas writes that even when we\nrecognize that God is, the \u201cis\u201d which we understand is not the act of\nbeing whereby God subsists in himself, but only that indicating that\nthe proposition \u201cthat he is\u201d is true (PB 3.383).\n\n\nGodfrey finds this too restrictive. And so after offering a detailed\nexplanation of the different ways in which one can know of something\n\u201cwhat it is\u201d and \u201cthat it is,\u201d he writes that\njust as in knowing material things we move from more confused to less\nconfused knowledge, so it is in the case of our natural knowledge of\nGod. Just as we find that some things are the principal causes of\nothers, and some are governed by others, so we impose the name\n\u201cGod\u201d to signify something in the universe which is the\none first cause of everything else and than which nothing greater can\nbe thought. But such nominal knowledge is not enough to prove that\nwhat we express by the name \u201cGod\u201d exists in reality or\n\u201cthat he is.\u201d Next we may follow Aristotle\u2019s procedure in\nPhysics VII where by eliminating recourse to an infinite\nregress of moved movers he concludes that one First Mover or God\nexists. And from the continuous motion of the first mobile sphere\nAristotle shows in Physics VIII that God is perpetual and\npure act. This tells us that God is in reality, but not what he is in\nany real sense. In the Metaphysics (Bk XII), continues\nGodfrey, Aristotle accepts the knowledge \u201cthat God is\u201d as\nproved in the Physics and now proceeds to show that certain\nperfections are present in God to the preeminent degree. According to\nGodfrey, Aristotle uses these perfections as quasi-differences and\nthereby progresses from knowledge \u201cthat God is\u201d to\nknowledge \u201cwhat he is\u201d by passing from a confused and\nquasi-generic knowledge to a more determined and quasi-specific\nknowledge. And so, too, proposes Godfrey, we may reason, for instance,\nfirst by knowing him as a substance, then as an incorporeal substance,\nthen as a living and intelligent incorporeal substance. He\nacknowledges that God does not really fall into any genus or\nspecies. Nonetheless, he maintains against Aquinas that we can know\n\u201cwhat God is\u201d in some real sense, even though he\nrecognizes that in this life such knowledge will always be imperfect\n(PB 3.384\u201386; Wippel, 1981, 108\u201315).\n Consistent with the above, Godfrey defends the presence of a\nplurality of attributes in God even though, because of the divine\nsimplicity, these are only conceptually distinct from the divine\nessence and from one another. In Quodlibet VII, q. 1 he distinguishes\ntwo ways in which the term \u201cattribute\u201d may be taken. It\nmay be used to signify a divine perfection in the sense that some\nperfection in a creature which does not imply any imperfection in and\nof itself, in other words a pure perfection, is assigned to God to an\neminent degree.  Or it may be taken as signifying a pure perfection\nwhich is realized in God as a \u201cquasi-quality\u201d which\nperfects the divine substance in a \u201cquasi-accidental\u201d\nfashion. Godfrey comments that it is in this second sense that\nattributes are usually applied to God, even though this is not\nintended to imply any real distinction or composition of substance and\nattribute in him. When taken in this second sense, Godfrey holds that\nthere are many such quasi-qualities which perfect God in this\nquasi-accidental way, and therefore, many divine attributes. They are\nassigned to God in preeminent fashion because of his infinite\nperfection (PB 3.265).\n\n\nIn this same question Godfrey was asked to resolve a still more\nfundamental issue. Because of God\u2019s absolute simplicity, divine\nattributes signify perfections that are really identical with the\ndivine essence and with one another. The conceptual distinction between\nthem can only arise from an intellect\u2019s consideration. But what is the\nultimate foundation for this conceptual distinction? Does it arise from\na consideration of God simply as he is in himself, or does it only\nresult from some reference to really distinct realizations of these\nperfections in creatures? Godfrey replies that if one takes an\nattribute in the first sense as implying that every pure perfection\npresent in creatures is to be assigned to God to an infinite degree,\nthe answer is clear. The intellect, especially a created intellect, can\narrive at such a conceptual distinction of divine attributes only by\nreasoning from the really distinct instantiations of such perfections\nin creatures (PB 3.267\u201370; Wippel, 1981, 116\u201318). But what about the\ndivine intellect? Godfrey then refers to and rejects the view of Henry\nof Ghent, according to whom attributes, when taken in the second sense,\ncan be recognized as distinct and as multiple by God himself insofar as\nhe views himself directly and without any reference to creatures.\nAgainst Henry, Godfrey maintains that not even God himself can be aware\nof this conceptual distinction between the divine attributes without\nreferring to other beings in which these perfections are present in\nreally distinct fashion. To hold otherwise would be to introduce too\nmuch distinction and diversity into the divine essence itself and would\nthereby compromise the divine simplicity (PB 3.267\u201373; Wippel, 1981,\n118\u201323; Maurer, 1999, 192\u2013200).\n",
