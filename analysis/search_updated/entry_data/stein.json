    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Work\n\nEdith Stein was born on 12 October 1891 into a bourgeois Jewish family\nin Breslau, Prussia (now Wroclaw, Poland). Her father died when she\nwas two, leaving her mother to run the family business\u2014a\nlumberyard\u2014while raising seven children. Edith attended local\nschool and then the Victoria Gymnasium in Breslau. Having graduated\nfirst in her class in the Abitur in 1911, Stein entered the University\nof Breslau to study psychology. Her professors included William Stern\nand Richard H\u00f6nigswald. Another professor, Georg Moskiewicz,\nintroduced her to Husserl\u2019s Logical Investigations and\nremarked that in G\u00f6ttingen the students philosophize day and\nnight and talk only of the phenomenon. Inspired, she transferred to\nG\u00f6ttingen in 1913. There she became an active member of the\nG\u00f6ttingen Philosophical Society, that included Reinach, Ingarden,\nand Conrad-Martius. In G\u00f6ttingen she also attended\nScheler\u2019s lectures, which left a deep impression. Stein\napproached Husserl to write a doctorate on phenomenology, and his\ninitial reaction was to recommend instead that she sit the state\nteaching examination. However, encouraged by Reinach, she completed\nher thesis in summer 1916 and graduated summa cum laude for\nher dissertation, Das Einf\u00fchlungsproblem in seiner\nhistorischen Entwicklung und in ph\u00e4nomenologischer\nBetrachtung (The Empathy Problem as it Developed Historically and\nConsidered Phenomenologically), part of which was published as Zum\nProblem der Einf\u00fchlung (On the Problem of Empathy;\nStein 1917).\n\nWhen Reinach died in the Great War in 1917, Stein helped edit his\ncollected writings. She then worked as Husserl\u2019s first paid\nassistant from October 1916 until February 1918, when she resigned in\nfrustration. She transcribed and edited, with major interventions,\nHusserl\u2019s research manuscripts, including Ideas II\n(finally published in 1952), and his Lectures on the Consciousness\non Internal Time (1905\u20131917), that was eventually brought\nto press by Heidegger in 1928 (with only the slightest acknowledgment\nof Stein\u2019s involvement). Stein\u2019s letters to Ingarden\nreveal that she was unable to interest Husserl in her revisions.\n\nStein campaigned to be allowed to register for a Habilitation,\nhitherto denied to women. She applied to G\u00f6ttingen in 1919 but\nwas rejected. Husserl\u2019s letter of recommendation of 6 February\n1919 (Husserl 1994: 548\u2013549) was not particularly supportive.\nShe wrote a major study intended as her Habilitation thesis,\nBeitr\u00e4ge zur philosophischen Begr\u00fcndung der Psychologie\nund der Geisteswissenschaften (1922), published in\nHusserl\u2019s Jahrbuch.\n\nFailing to find a mentor for her Habilitation, Stein returned to\nBreslau to offer private philosophical tutorials. Stein\u2019s close\nfriends there were the phenomenologists Theodor Conrad and Hedwig\nMartius. At their home, Stein read St. Theresa of Avila\u2019s\nautobiography and immediately felt she had found the truth. She soon\nconverted to Catholicism. Her conversion deeply disappointed her\nmother and many of her Jewish friends.\n\nShe began studying Thomas Aquinas intensely and translated his De\nVeritate (Stein 2008a,b). In 1930 she sought again to register\nfor the Habilitation, contacting Heidegger at Freiburg, who was\nreasonably supportive. By 1931 she had completed a new Habilitation\nthesis Potency and Act (1931). However, she was appointed to\na teaching post at the German Institute for Scientific Pedagogy in\nM\u00fcnster, which disrupted her Habilitation plans. She also thought\nthe work inadequate and embarked on a new study, Finite and\nEternal Being (1950/2006).\n\nFollowing the rise to power of the National Socialists in Germany, on\n19 April 1933 Stein, because of her Jewish descent, was dismissed from\nher position in M\u00fcnster. In October 1933, she entered the\nCarmelite convent at Cologne. In April 1934, she entered the\nnovitiate, taking the religious name Teresa Benedicta of the Cross\n(Teresia Benedicta a Cruce). In 1938, Stein was transferred for safety\nto the Carmelite convent at Echt, Holland. There she wrote her two\nmost important theological treatises, The Science of the\nCross (2003) and Ways to Know God (1993).\n\nThe condemnation of Nazi anti-Semitism by the Dutch bishops, on 26\nJuly 1942, provoked the German authorities to arrest non-Aryan Roman\nCatholics. With her sister Rosa, also a Catholic convert, Teresa\nBenedicta was arrested in Echt by the Gestapo on 2 August 1942 and\nshipped to Auschwitz concentration camp, arriving on August 7. She\ndied with her sister Rosa on 9 August 1942. Survivors of the death\ncamp testified that she assisted other sufferers with great\ncompassion. At a ceremony in Cologne on 1 May 1987, Pope John Paul II\nbeatified Edith Stein, and canonized her in 1998. Her interrupted\nautobiography, Life in a Jewish Family (1985), was published\nposthumously.\n2. Early Phenomenology\n2.1 Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Psychology\n\nStein developed her philosophy of psychology in the\nBeitr\u00e4ge around the time she was also editing\nHusserl\u2019s Ideas II and it neatly ties in with the\nlatter\u2019s aim of developing a transcendental phenomenological\naccount of the human person. The systematic connection between the two\nmain parts of Stein\u2019s Beitr\u00e4ge (\u201cPsychic\nCausality\u201d and \u201cIndividual and Community\u201d) lies in\nthe overarching project of the work to carve out the ontological place\nof the human person in relation to both the natural and the spiritual\nworlds, the latter of which is constituted by social and communal\nrelations (1922: 3[1], 110[129]).\n\nThree issues sit at the center of Stein\u2019s philosophy of mind and\npsychology: \n\nthe connections between conscious experiences, (the stream of)\nconsciousness and the mental and psychic domain; \nthe motivational laws of the mental, conative and volitional\ndomain, and \nthe \u201cintertwinement\u201d (Ineinandergreifen) of\ndifferent forms of causality and motivation. \n\n\nAll three issues cluster around Stein\u2019s multilayered account of\ncausality and her original conception of so-called \u201cpsychic\ncausality\u201d. The notion of psychic causality is introduced\nagainst the background of the traditional determinism/indeterminism\ndebate, and aims to present an alternative to both a\nreduction of the psyche to physical nature and a complete\nseparation of the former from the latter (1922: 5[2]).\n\nAccording to Stein, nothing in the emergence of an experiential phase\nis determined. It does not make any phenomenological sense to inquire\ninto determining causes here; experiences simply \u201cflow\nalong\u201d in a \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d and constitute\n\u201can undivided and indivisible continuum\u201d (1922: 11[9]).\nWhat constitutes their (diachronic and experiential) unity is the\n\u201coriginally generating\u201d or \u201cultimately\nconstituting\u201d (urspr\u00fcnglich zeugend,\nletzt-konstituierend) stream itself (1922: 12[10]). This, in\nturn, is unified by the irreducible experiential fact that all\nexperiences \u201cemanate from one I\u201d (1922:\n15[13]).\n\nSo far, then, natural causality seems to have no place in the\nexperiential life of subject. However, as Stein already claims in her\nEmpathy-book (1917: 66\u201368[49\u201351]) and elaborates\nthroughout the Beitr\u00e4ge, a different form of causality\nis at work on the experiential level. The causally efficacious\nexperiential states in the psychic life of individuals are so-called\n\u201clife-feelings\u201d (Lebensgef\u00fchle) and a\nsubject\u2019s \u201clife-power\u201d (Lebenskraft; a term\nthat originates in Hermann Lotze (1843), but that we also find in\nTheodor Lipps (1883), from whom Stein probably takes the term).\nLife-feelings are, broadly speaking, best understood as the affective\ndispositions of a psychophysical organism that bring about certain\ncognitive, conative or affective states. They determine the very way a\nsubject is aware of and experiences these states. They also determine\none\u2019s own bodily awareness, i.e., one\u2019s \u201cbodily\nattunement\u201d (leibliche Befinden; 1917: 87[70]). Stein\ncharacterizes life-feelings as the \u201cmomentary state\n(Beschaffenheit) of the I\u2014its life-disposition\n(Lebenszust\u00e4ndlichkeit)\u201d (1922: 22[22]). If this\ndisposition is sedimented, it becomes a subject\u2019s life-power\n(ibid.; see\n sect. 2.2;\n see Betschart 2009). Typical examples of life-feelings are weariness,\nfreshness, vigor, and irritability. Such psychic-bodily dispositions\n\u201ceffectuate\u201d (wirkend) experiential changes in\n\u201cone\u2019s feeling disposed (Sichbefinden)\u201d and\nin turn \u201cinfluence the whole course of the co-occurring\nexperiences\u201d. If I feel weary, \u201ceverything that emerges in\nvarious fields of sensation will be affected by it\u201d, colors will\nappear colorless, sounds toneless, etc. (1922: 16[15]; see also 1922:\n65[75]; 75[86]).\n\nIn order to account for these effects, Stein introduces the notion of\n\u201ccausality of the experiential domain\u201d.\n\u201cExperiential causality\u201d\n(Erlebniskausalit\u00e4t) is different from \u201cmechanical\ncausality\u201d but may still be viewed as an \u201canalogon of\ncausality in the realm of physical nature\u201d (1922:\n16\u201317[15]. According to Stein\u2019s somewhat idiosyncratic\ndescription compared to the classical Humean conceptions, there is a\ntripartite chain of events in mechanistic causation: \n\n a \u201ccausing\u201d (verursachendes; e.g., the\nmovement of a ball) and\n a \u201ccaused event\u201d (verursachtes Geschehen),\nor the effect (e.g., another ball moving), and \n a sort of mediating \u201cevent\u201d that is the proper\n\u201ccause\u201d (Ursache). \n\n\nThus, in mechanistic causation, two events are interconnected by a\nthird, whereas in experiential causation, there are only two\noccurrences, jointly causing experiential change. Here, the two\nexperiences causally interconnected are both subject to\n\u201cchange\u201d, and jointly effectuate a \u201cchange in the\nwhole course of the simultaneous experience\u201d (1922: 16[15]).\n\u201cThe life-feeling corresponds to the causing event\u201d, while\n\u201cthe course of the rest of the experience corresponds to the\ncaused event\u201d (1922: 17[15]). But the event, referred to as\n\u201cthe cause\u201d of the experiential change, \u201cis not\ninserted between causing and caused event\u201d. It is not\nindependent from the experiential change, but rather an intrinsic\nmoment of it. Accordingly, it is impossible for a subject to have\ncertain life-feelings that have no effect on the course of her\nexperiences. But what mechanistic and experiential causation share is\nthat there cannot be causally contradicting events or outright\nincoherent requisite outcomes of the causal process. For example, \n\n\njust as it is inconceivable that a ball that\u2019s flung down rises\nup as a result of the pitch, it is inconceivable that weariness\n\u201cenlivens\u201d the stream of consciousness. (1922:\n17[15\u201316])\n\n\nStein distinguishes three aspects of experiences and asks whether and\nhow they are subject to psychic-causal influences: \n\n\n(1) a content that is taken up into consciousness (e.g., a\ncolor datum or enjoyment); (2) the experience (Erleben) of\nthat content, its being-taken-up (Aufgenommenwerden) into\nconsciousness (the having of the sensation, the feeling of enjoyment);\n(3) the consciousness of that experiencing, which\u2014in a higher or\nlower degree\u2014always accompanies it and because of which the\nexperiencing itself is also called consciousness. (1922:\n18[16\u201317]) \n\n\nImportantly, she argues that all these dimensions are subject to the\npsychic-causal influence of one\u2019s life-feelings and psychic\ndispositions (1922: 19[19]). For instance, \n\n\nwith mounting freshness, the awareness of the experiencing increases\nand so do the clarity, discriminateness, and, we might well say, the\n\u201cliveliness\u201d of the contents. (ibid.)\n\n\nThe psyche, then, is characterized by an \u201cincessant occurring\n(Geschehen)\u201d and \u201cincessant effecting\u201d\n(Wirken; 1922: 27[29]). Indeed, Stein puts forth the\n\u201cgeneral law of causality\u201d, according to which\n\u201call psychic occurrences are caused (kausal\nbedingt)\u201d (1922: 29[32]). Causality plays an ontologically\nconstitutive role. There is \u201cno psychic reality without\ncausality\u201d (ibid.); everything that enters the psychic domain\n\u201cowes its existence\u201d and is regulated by life-power, and\nlife-power alone (1922: 27[29]).\n\nBut where does this leave us with regard to individuals being\ndetermined by psychic powers? Stein cautions us that with the\nlaws of psychic causation \u201cnothing whatsoever is yet\ndecided\u201d about the issue of determinism (1922: 29\u201330[32]).\nStein concludes that we have only \u201cprobabilistic\ninferences\u201d and \u201cvague\u201d laws here (1922: 33[36], see\nalso 80\u201381[92\u201393], 98\u201399[114\u2013115]). Notice,\nhowever, that it doesn\u2019t follow from the fact that the relation\nbetween psychic causes and their effects cannot be\n\u201cexactly predicted\u201d or \u201cdetermined\u201d\nthat there are no \u201cintuitively evident (einsichtige)\ncorrelations\u201d to be discovered (1922: 33[36]). Quite the\ncontrary, and it is precisely the task of the\nphenomenological psychologist to explore these. Herein also\nlies the originality of Stein\u2019s conception of the laws of\npsychic causality vis-\u00e0-vis both Humean causality,\nwhere the issue is the temporal separateness and ontological\nindependence of cause and effect, and the conception of\n\u201cvague\u201d nomological correlations that non-exact empirical\nand social sciences deal with, which for Stein are exemplified by\n\u201cdescriptive natural sciences and folk-psychology\u201d\n(ibid.). Compared to both these traditional conceptions of causality,\nthe distinctive feature of a phenomenological psychological\nexplanation of the causal laws of the psychic domain is that\nwe can in fact \u201cinfer from perceptually given [psychic]\nfacts\u201d of a given individual her future ones. Importantly,\nhowever, such inferences have only \u201cempirical validity\u201d,\nthey are always \u201cdefeasible or corrigible\u201d by the\nexperience of the respective subject (1922:\n33\u201334[36\u201337]).\n\nMoreover, Stein points to another consideration that speaks against\npsychic determinism. After all, whether or not a \u201cgiven state is\nexactly determined by the series of preceding ones and can be\nmeasured\u201d depends on whether there is something \u201cother\nthan merely causal factors\u201d at play (1922: 30[32]).\nIndeed, a large part of Beitr\u00e4ge is devoted to exploring\nthese other factors and their interplay with the psychic and spiritual\nstates of individuals. Specifically, \u201cthe life of the psyche\n[is] the result of the interplay of different types of powers\u201d\n(1922: 99[115]). Roughly, these are: (1) sensate and (2) spiritual\nlife-powers, (3) the various motivational and non-motivational powers\nresulting from drives, strivings, impulses, inclinations, intentions,\nas well as cognitive, evaluative and volitional \u201cstances\u201d\n(Stellungnahmen), (4) the will-power of autonomous\nindividuals, and (5) the motivational forces of the spiritual domain\nand the laws of reason. Let us summarize their different roles and\nfunctions vis-\u00e0-vis the constitution and the determination of\npsychic and mental life.\n\nStein distinguishes \u201cspiritual\u201d (geistige) from\n\u201csensate\u201d (sinnliche) life-power (1922:\n69\u201376[79\u201387]). Sensate life-power \u201croots the psyche\nin nature\u201d (1922: 99[115]), namely through the psyche\u2019s\n\u201centrenchment\u201d in the lived body (Leiblichkeit);\nand by virtue of the lived body\u2019s dependence on what Stein calls\nPhysis, a dependence established by the sensate dimension,\nsensate life-power grounds the psyche also in \u201cmaterial\nnature\u201d (1922: 70[81]). Sensate life-power \n\n\ntransforms the reception of sensory data or to different capacities\nfor the reception of sensory data, as well as into sensual drives and\ntheir activities. (1922: 99[115]) \n\n\nNotice that the psychic and sensate dimension of the body at stake\nhere is partly determined by psychic causality and life-power and, at\nthe same time, is \u201cexperienced as bodily-lived states\u201d\n(als leibliche Zust\u00e4nde erlebt). In this respect,\nStein\u2019s conception of the sensate dimension of bodily feelings\ncuts across the traditional phenomenological distinction between the\nlived or felt body (Leib), on the one hand, and the material\nbody under a third-personal, physical description\n(K\u00f6rper), on the other (see on Stein\u2019s\nLeib/K\u00f6per-distinction esp. 1917:\n56\u201365[40\u201348]). While sensate life-power, then, grounds the\npsyche in the lived body as well as the material body and nature,\nspiritual life-power, \u201cmakes the psyche accessible to the world\nof objects\u201d. It derives its powers from the \u201cworld of\nvalues\u201d as well as from the spiritual power of other individuals\nand the \u201cspirit of god\u201d (1922: 99[115]). It concerns all\nthe dispositions and capabilities of the subject that are required for\nengaging in cognitive and creative processes, with different sorts of\nvalues, as well as with other persons and their values (1922:\n70\u201375[81\u201386]). Spiritual and sensate life-powers, in turn,\nare interwoven through psychic causality.\n\nPsychic states and dispositions vary with regard to their\ndetermined/indeterminate and motivational nature. Stein identifies\nnumerous complex factors that affect the nature of a psychic state or\ndisposition, such as its teleological nature or purposefulness\n(zielgerichtet), whether it is triggered by rational motives\nor pure sensory stimuli, or how the subject actively relates to it and\nregulates its influences (1922: 53\u201356[61\u201365];\n60\u201364[68\u201374]; 78\u201380[90\u201392]). Strivings, for\ninstance, are subject to psychic causation and affective or evaluative\n\u201cstances of the ego\u201d (e.g., delighting over the\npleasantness of an alluring journey) but also to the forces of the\nvolitional domain (1922: 55[62]). The volitional domain is itself\ncomplex, incorporating efforts (Sichbem\u00fchen), intentions\n(Vorsatz), volitional acts (Willensakt), volitional\nstances (Willensstellungnahme), and the actual initiation of\nan action (Einleiten der Handlung; 1922:\n48\u201353[55\u201360]; 61\u201364[70\u201374];\n76\u201380[87\u201392]). Volitions require, as all other\nexperiential acts, a certain amount of life-power, and accordingly sap\nthe life-power of individuals (1922: 76[87]; 80[92]). Intentions, on\nthe other hand, mediate between volitional stances and actions (1922:\n76[88]). As such, intentions derive their force from their own\nspontaneous impulses (1922: 78[90]); they constitute the \u201cfree\nmoment\u201d in human psychology.\n\nMotivation is the \u201cenacting\u201d of an experience\n\u201cdue to (auf Grund) the other, for the\nsake of the other\u201d (1922: 36[41]). It is the\n\u201cfundamental lawfulness of spiritual life\u201d (1922: 35[39]),\nand \u201csubjects the psyche to the rule of reasons\u201d (1922:\n100[116]; see also 1917: 122\u2013123[117]). Importantly, motivation is\nessentially an egoic activity, whereas psychic causality\nworks on the pre-egoic level of \u201cpure passivity\u201d (1922:\n35[39]). As Stein aptly puts it: \n\n\nThe \u201cfulcrum\u201d by which motives are put into play is always\nthe I. It performs one act, because it has performed another.\n(1922: 36[41]) \n\n\nOn the one hand, there is a \u201cradical\u201d,\n\u201cunbridgeable\u201d difference between motives and causes\n(1922: 41[47]), as we don\u2019t find any motives in non-biological\nphysical nature; on the other hand, the life of the psyche is infused\nwith various causal processes, and psychic causality and motivation\nvariously intersect. Stein elaborates this \u201cintermeshing of\ncausality and motivation\u201d on the level of sensate and spiritual\nlife-power, and in the perceptual, affective, sensual, and volition\ndomain (1922: 64\u201380[74\u201392]; see also 1917:\n66\u201368[49\u201351]). In order to see this, consider\nStein\u2019s intriguing thought-experiment of a purely spiritual\nbeing, lacking a \u201clife-sphere\u201d: a being moved only by\n\u201cintellectual motives\u201d would be not so much inconceivable\nas literally driveless (1922: 75[87]). It might still grasp certain\nvalues in emotions (see below,\n sect. 2.2)\n and these might rationally motivate further evaluative or emotive\nacts; but ultimately such a being would not have the necessary\ninitiative required to enact those motives or act upon those values.\nMoreover, normally we have distinct, often conflicting, motives, which\nare intermeshed with a sedimented history of evaluative reactions to\nthem. A purely spiritual being could not integrate those motives so as\nto arrive at any conclusive decision and would ultimately lack\nagency.\n\nTo summarize, we can best understand Stein\u2019s theory of\nautonomous personal agency, and indeed her overall analysis of\npersons, if we appreciate one of the leitmotifs running through her\nwhole early phenomenological work: the view that experiences can be\nmore or less \u201cclose\u201d to their very anchoring, namely their\negoic or personal core. The idea is that experiential states of\nwhatever sort (including beliefs, emotions, volitions, cognitive\nstates, etc.) can impact the self. In turn, their initiation\nand their course are impacted more or less by egoic activity,\ndepending on how much spontaneous engagement and control the I exerts,\nor is able to exert, on them (see\n sect. 2.2).\n2.2 Philosophy of Emotions\n\nStein\u2019s theory of emotions is propounded in her\nEmpathy-book (esp. 1917: 65\u201372[48\u201354],\n116\u2013124[98\u2013106]) and in the Beitr\u00e4ge (1922:\n21\u201329[21\u201332], 132\u2013138[157\u2013164],\n181[217\u2013218]); see also 1920/2004:\n128\u2013129, 136\u2013140). It represents a complex elaboration of\nthe role that affectivity plays in the constitution of personhood, on\nhow emotions relate to expression, motivation and volition, and how\naffective states of others can be empathically grasped. Accordingly,\nStein\u2019s philosophy of emotions intersects with both her\nphilosophy of psychology and her theory of empathy. While influenced\nby Scheler (esp. 1916/1926), Stein\u2019s account is highly original,\nin particular regarding the analysis of moods and sentiments,\ndifferent levels of affective depth, and a fine-grained elaboration of\nthe \u201cstratification\u201d of the emotive live of persons.\n\nPartly drawing on Scheler, Stein distinguishes five different strata\nof affectivity:\n\n(1) Sensory feelings: On the most basic level, we have\n\u201cfeeling impressions\u201d or \u201csensory feelings\u201d\n(Gef\u00fchlsempfindungen, sinnliche Gef\u00fchle), such as\nitching, bodily pain, or the pleasure of the taste or texture of food\n(1917: 65\u201366[48\u201349]). Stein holds a version of\nintentionalism regarding bodily sensations (Crane 1998, 78\u201388).\nThis is the thesis that pain and other sensory feelings have properly\nspeaking intentional objects and present parts of the body of the\nemoter under certain aspects to her. What is thus intentionally given\nto the emoter as an object, however, is not some\n\u201cpain-object\u201d but its bodily-felt location. Stein\ncharacterizes such sensory feelings also as \u201cbodily localizable\nsensations\u201d (leiblich lokalisierte Empfindnisse; 1917:\n58[42]). Accordingly, the pleasure of a taste or texture is\n\u201cfelt where the food is tasted\u201d or \u201cwhere the piece\nof fabric touches my skin\u201d (1917: 65[48]. Moreover, Stein\nattributes to these low-level feelings an intrinsic relation to the\nself. In sensory feelings, \u201cI experience my affective\nsensitivity (sinnliche Empf\u00e4nglichkeit) as the highest\nand most outer layer of my I\u201d (1917: 118[100]). This concerns\none of the core tenets of Stein\u2019s phenomenology of affectivity:\nDifferent layers of affectivity have different \u201cI-depths\u201d\n(Ichtiefe), or different ways and degrees in which emoters\nare impacted by affective experiences (1917:\n119\u2013124[101\u2013105]).\n\n(2) Common feelings: The next stratum of affectivity is\nall-pervasive. One of the key insights of Stein\u2019s account of\nemotions is that every conscious experience is always penetrated and\nmodulated by affectivity. Famously, Heidegger puts forth an\nexistential-ontological version of this claim, which has also been\nfurther developed in neo-Heideggerian accounts of \u201cexistential\nfeelings\u201d (Ratcliffe 2019). All experiences, including\ncognitions, conations, perceptions, and volitions, are\n\u201ccolored\u201d or \u201clit up\u201d by, or \u201csubmerged\ninto\u201d what Stein calls \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201ccommon\nfeelings\u201d (Gemeingef\u00fchle; e.g., 1917:\n65\u201366[48\u201349], 86[68], 118\u2013119[100\u2013101]; 1922:\n123[145]). They are essentially affective states of the lived\nbody. For example, weariness, freshness or irritability are not\nintentional in the sense that they don\u2019t present or evaluate\nparticular objects, events or persons. But, like sensory feelings,\nthey are in a minimal sense intentional: they relate the emoter to her\nown overall bodily state and thus indicate the emoter\u2019s\n\u201cattunement\u201d (Befindlichkeit), as Heidegger will\nlater call it. Accordingly, Stein aptly characterizes common feelings\n(together with moods) as forms of \u201cself-experiencing\u201d\n(Sich-erlebens) (1917: 118[100]). Moreover, like sensory\nfeelings, common feelings occupy a \u201cJanus-faced position\u201d\n(Zwitterstellung): they are not only \u201cin\u201d my\nlived body, as it were, but also \u201cin me, they emanate out of my\nI\u201d (1917: 65[48\u201349]).\n\n(3) Moods: The third layer of affectivity is constituted by\nmoods (Stimmungen). Like common feelings, they constitute an\nall-pervasive dimension of our affective lives: \n\n\nevery emotional experience bears [a] certain mood-component\n(Stimmungskomponente), in virtue of which emotions emanate\nand expand from their initial place and fill up the Ego. (1917:\n122[104]) \n\n\nThere are two important differences to common feelings, however:\nfirst, moods do not have a \u201cbodily nature\u201d (leiblicher\nNatur), they do not \u201cfill out\u201d the felt body as the\ncommon feeling of sluggishness, say, does; hence a \u201cpurely\nspiritual\u201d being could in principle be subject to moods too\n(1917: 65[49]; note that the English translation wrongly states the\nexact opposite of the German here). Secondly, moods are intentional in\nthe sense that they have an \u201cobjective correlate: for the\ncheerful, the world is submerged into a rosy shimmer\u201d (1917:\n108\u2013109[92]; see also 1922: 181[217]). In line with her theory of\npsychophysical causation (see\n sect. 2.1),\n Stein maintains that there are \u201creciprocal\n\u2018influences\u2019\u201d and interconnections between the\nspiritual and the bodily dimension of affectivity, or between moods\nand common feelings: \n\n\nsuppose I make a recovery trip and arrive at a sunny, pleasant spot,\n[feeling] how a cheerful mood starts to take possession of me, but\ncannot prevail, because I feel sluggish and weary. (1917:\n65\u201366[49]; see also 1922: 65\u201366[75\u201376]) \n\n\nMoods can also interact with proper emotions, for example, I can have\na \u201cserious\u201d or a \u201ccheerful joy\u201d (1917:\n122[104]).\n\n(4) Emotions: \u201cEmotions in the pregnant sense\u201d\n(1917: 119[100]), or \u201cspiritual feelings\u201d (geistige\nGef\u00fchle) (1917: 66[50]), as Stein also calls them, are\nproperly speaking intentional states: \u201c[emotions] are always\nfeelings of something. In every feeling (F\u00fchlen), I am\ndirected at an object\u201d (1917: 119[100]). Stein also concurs with\nwhat is sometimes called the \u201cfoundational thesis\u201d, held\nby Brentano, Husserl or Pf\u00e4nder, according to which emotions are\ngrounded in or derive their intentionality from some presentational or\nrepresentational act (Vorstellung) or cognition (Drummond\n2018: 9ff.). This is the reason why a \u201cpurely feeling subject is\nan impossibility\u201d (1917: 125[107]; see also 1917: 67[50]). On the\nother hand, Stein controversially contends that, just as in the case\nof moods, a \u201cpure spirit\u201d or a \u201cbody-less\nsubject\u201d may become for example frightened, but will not\n\u201close its mind\u201d, as the fear will not exerting any psychic\ncausality. Such a creature will also \u201cfeel pleasure and pain in\nits full depth\u201d, even if \u201cthese emotions don\u2019t exert\nany [bodily] effect\u201d. Spiritual feelings are as a matter of\nfact bodily felt, but considered in their \u201cpure\nessence\u201d \u201cnot body-bound (leibgebunden)\u201d\n(1917: 66\u201367[50]).\n\nAccording to Stein, we must distinguish four affective dimensions with\nregard to proper emotions: \n\ntheir \u201cdepth\u201d (Tiefe), i.e., roughly their\nimpact on the self (for contemporary reassessments, see Pugmire 2005;\nVendrell Ferran 2008, 2015a,b); \ntheir \u201creach\u201d (Reichweite), which is\n\u201ccorrelated to the level of the value\u201d and\n\u201cprescribes the layer, to which it is \u2018sensible\u2019 for\nme to let the emotions penetrate me\u201d (vern\u00fcnftigerweise\neindringen lassen darf). For example, I ought not let my\nannoyance over an overdue piece of news that I\u2019m waiting for\nconsume the attention needed for another task that is actually more\nimportant to me (1917: 122[104]); \ntheir \u201cduration\u201d, i.e., the diachronic extension of an\nemotion in a subject\u2019s experiential stream, which is dependent\nupon the emotion\u2019s depth (ibid.); \nthe \u201cintensity\u201d of an emotion.\n\n\nWhereas the factual intensity of an emotion is not subject to\nthe laws of reason, we can and ought to modulate an\nemotion\u2019s impact on our volitions and behavior: I may very well\nbe completely \u201cfilled out\u201d by an actually mild irritation,\nwhich can also endure overly long, or \u201cfeel a high value less\nintensively as a lower one and hence be enticed to realize the lower\none\u201d. But Stein hastens to add that \u201cbeing\n\u2018enticed\u2019 (\u2018verleitet\u2019) precisely\nimplies that the laws of reason have been violated here\u201d (1917:\n123[105]). .\n\nCrucially, for Stein, emotions can be \u201crationally\u201d\nappropriate, and \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d. What\nmakes emotions subject to rational and normative\ncorrectness-conditions is, once again, their \u201cbeing anchored in\nthe I\u201d. Stein considers someone who is\n\u201c\u2018overcome\u2019 by the loss of his wealth, i.e.,\nimpacted in the core of his I\u201d. The irrationality then consists\nof an \u201cinversion of the hierarchy of values\u201d or even\n\u201ca loss of emotionally sensitive insight (f\u00fchlende\nEinsicht) into higher values and the lack of correlative personal\nlayers\u201d. (1917: 120[101]). Another example is somebody who\nenjoys her aesthetic enjoyment itself more than the disclosed\naesthetic values of an art-piece (1917: 121[102]). Finally, there is\nanother type of inappropriateness that perfectly fits into\nStein\u2019s overall account, but which doesn\u2019t presuppose\nendorsement of the theory of value hierarchy or problematic forms of\nvalue-realism (see below): Thus, some have suggested distinguishing\nthe moral, practical and prudential appropriateness of emotions from\ntheir \u201cfittingness\u201d. Roughly, an emotion E of a\nsubject S is fitting if E\u2019s target has the evaluative\nfeatures which E pertains to affectively present to S\n(d\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2000; cf. Mulligan 2017; De Monticelli\n2020). Put differently, an emotion is fitting, if it picks out\nthose evaluative features of the target that really matter\nto the emoter herself. Fittingness is an essentially\nsubject-relative notion. It doesn\u2019t concern any objective\n(axiological or moral) properties. Consider Stein\u2019s example\nagain: if the loss of wealth really matters to the ruined\nstock-broker, her utter despair will indeed fit, notwithstanding the\nmoral status of speculative money; if she, on the other hand, actually\nhas long hoped that she rids herself of the burden of spending the\nrest of her life in figuring out ways of investing her capital, then\nher utter despair over the loss will be unfitting.\n\n(5) Sentiments: the final layer of affectivity is constituted\nby \u201csentiments\u201d (Gesinnungen) or affective\nattitudes directed toward persons. Stein lists a number of examples,\nsome of which contemporary philosophers typically subsume under\ndifferent classes of affective phenomena, such as love and hatred, or\ngratitude, resentment and vindictiveness. While love or hatred are\nindeed best characterized as sentiments (as did already Pf\u00e4nder\n(1913), who had a strong influence on Stein), gratitude and resentment\nwould today be rather subsumed under the class of reactive attitudes,\nand vindictiveness is better characterized as an affective character\ntrait (Deonna and Teroni 2012: 8\u20139). What unifies this class\nof sentiments, according to Stein, however, is that they are\n\u201cemotions having other persons as their objects\u201d. Like all\nother dimensions of affectivity, they are also \u201canchored on\ndifferent levels of the I (e.g., love deeper than affection)\u201d\nand \u201chave personal values as their correlates\u201d (1917:\n120[101f.]).\n\nIt is an open question whether Stein thinks that all of these five\ndimensions of affectivity are intentionally directed at and disclose\nvalues. Emotions and sentiments are fully-fledged intentional states\ngrasping values, but it is less clear whether sensory feelings and\ncommon feelings or moods (which she also occasionally discusses) do so\ntoo. But what does it mean that emotions \u201cgrasp values\u201d?\nStein concurs with early phenomenological views of the\nepistemic-evaluative function of feelings: Feelings not only have\nevaluative properties of things, persons and state-of-affairs as their\nproper intentional objects; they are our most direct, and indeed best,\naccess to values. It is, however, not clear how to conceive of the\nontological and phenomenological status of values. Stein, like all\nearly phenomenologists, including not only the so-called\n\u201crealist\u201d phenomenologists such as Scheler, Reinach, Stein\nor Hildebrand but also the transcendental-idealist Husserl, hold some\nform of value realism. But again, it is far from clear what\nphenomenological value realism exactly entails, and Stein is rather\nsilent on that issue. The most charitable reading of Stein\u2019s\nrealist theory of values seems to be one that cuts across the\nfollowing alternative: Either values are first constituted by emotive\nacts or they are independent properties of things, persons or events\nthat emotions merely respond to. According to Stein\u2019s middle-way\naccount, though value-properties are but intentional correlates of\nemotions, in having emotions, we can appropriately or inappropriately\ntrack values. Values, thus, retain a certain ontological autonomy\nvis-\u00e0-vis emotive acts, but they are not fully independent from\nthose acts, as it is precisely in having emotions that objects are\nproperly disclosed as valuable.\n\nIn order to understand this position, we must consequently understand\nthe disclosive function of emotions, or what Scheler, Stein and other\nphenomenologists call \u201cvalue-feeling\u201d\n(Wertf\u00fchlen). To begin with, it is crucial not to\nmisunderstand the term \u201cvalue-feeling\u201d by reifying the\nvalues and value-properties of the evaluated objects upon which\nemotions are directed. Furthermore, value-feelings do not\nindependently track values. Just like \u201cemotions in the pregnant\nsense\u201d, they are dependent upon the \u201cknowledge\u201d of\nor an intentional acquaintance with the object to which a certain\nvalue pertains. This knowledge is typically constituted by perception\nor some other intuitive act, such as imagination. Furthermore, a\nvalue-feeling is an affective phenomenon. But it is not a distinct\ntype of affective act or feeling (cf., however, Mulligan 2010a,b,\n2017).\n\nHow, then, are value-feelings and the experience or the feeling of an\nemotion related? Stein\u2019s position is again not unambiguous. We\nfind a few ambivalent passages that are sometimes cited to show that\nshe does not identify value-feelings and feelings (see\nMulligan 2010a: 236; 2017: 235; cf. Vendrell Ferran 2015a). For example, Stein explicitly\ndistinguishes between \u201cvalue-feeling\u201d\n(Wertf\u00fchlen) and \u201cthe feeling of the existence of\na value\u201d as well as between \u201cvalue-emotion\u201d\n(Wertgef\u00fchl) and \u201cthe depth of a feeling\u201d\n(1917: 120[102]). At another central passage, however, Stein claims\nthat \n\n\nattempts to distinguish \u201cfeeling\u201d (F\u00fchlen)\nand \u201cemotion\u201d (Gef\u00fchl) \n\n\nare futile, since they \n\n\ndon\u2019t denote distinct types of experiences, but only different\n\u201cdirections\u201d (Richtungen) of one and the same\nexperience. (1917: 117 [98\u201399]; see also\n116\u2013121[98\u2013103]) \n\n\nThe systematically most plausible interpretation, in any case, is to\nconstrue, with Stein, the phenomenological relation between the felt\nand the evaluative or appraisal function of emotions in terms of a\ndouble-aspect theory (see for a similar account De Monticelli\n2020). According to this, Stein does not contrast the act of\nvalue-feelings with the feeling or the emotional reaction that is\ntriggered by those values; rather, they are just two aspects of the\naffective intentionality of emotions (see 1917:\n116\u2013121[98\u2013103].\n\nAnd yet, Stein doesn\u2019t simply identify the act of\nvalue-feeling and the feeling-state; instead, she distinguishes the\ntwo aspects in order to accommodate cases in which a value is\ndisclosed but precisely doesn\u2019t affectively impact me\n(\u201cleaves me cold\u201d), or doesn\u2019t elicit a\ncorresponding emotion (see 1922: 133\u2013136[159\u2013163]; cf.\nVendrell Ferran 2017). Thus, emotions are disclosing not only\nevaluative properties but also something about the appropriateness and\nthe depth of the felt evaluation, or the emotional experience as such.\nWhen I have a feeling (e.g., joy over x), what is disclosed to me is\nnot only the evaluative property (joyfulness) of x but that\nand how x matters to me or impacts me in a certain\nway (as meriting a joyful response from me). A contemporary equivalent\nof this view can be found in Bennett W. Helm\u2019s account of\nemotions. According to Helm, \n\n\nemotions are evaluative feelings: feelings of evaluative content,\nwhereby import impresses itself upon us. (\u2026) we might also say\nthat emotions are felt evaluations: evaluations that we make\nby feeling them. (Helm 2001: 74) \n\n\nLike for Helm and some other contemporary accounts of affective\nintentionality (e.g., Goldie 2000), Stein conceives of the intentional\nand evaluative component, on the one hand, and the (bodily) feeling\ncomponent, on the other, not as distinct but as inextricably\nintertwined (1917: 117[99]).\n\nEmotions also bear an intrinsic evaluative relation to\noneself and indeed a constitutive relation to one\u2019s\npersonality and personhood. Emotions are essentially self- and\npersonhood-related. To understand this claim, consider how I-depth and\nthe depth of a value-feeling are correlated and how value-feelings\nhave an intrinsic self-evaluative dimension. In an emotional\nexperience, a subject is not only directed upon the evaluative\nfeatures of an object, but also \u201cexperiences herself, the\nfeelings as coming from the \u2018depths of her I\u2019\u201d.\n(1917: 117[98]) This self-experience is not a bare affective awareness\nof ourselves, but of our specific personality: \n\n\nIn emotions, we experience ourselves not only as existing but also as\nbeing such-and-such, the emotions manifest personal characteristics.\n(1917: 117[99]) \n\n\nTo rephrase in Helm\u2019s terminology: Emotions are felt evaluations\nor \u201cfeelings of value\u201d, whereby the import impresses\nitself upon us. But import can only impress itself upon oneself if\nthose values are expressive of one\u2019s concerns or of what is\nimportant for oneself.\n\nBut there is even more to the relation between emotions and the self.\nEmotions not only appraise objects, indicate import for one and\nmanifest our personality\u2014moreover, and by the same token, they\nalways have a self-evaluative dimension. Emotions evaluate me\nas the subject for whom those objects have value. My emotions thus\nalways calibrate and recalibrate my \u201cself-esteem\u201d\n(Selbstwertgef\u00fchl; 1917: 121[103]).\n\nEmotions are also essentially connected to expression, volition and\naction. Emotions \u201cmotivate\u201d both their expression and\nvolition (1917: 68\u201370[51\u201353];\n123\u2013124[104\u2013105]). Stein stresses that there is a\nnecessary relation between feeling and expression, which is not a\n\u201ccausal\u201d but \u201ca nexus of essence and sense\u201d or\n\u201can essential relation and a relation of sense\u201d\n(Wesens- und Sinnzusammenhang) (1917: 70[53]). The relation\nholds even if there is no direct \u201couter\u201d, facial or\nbodily, expression, and the feeling only results in a\n\u201c\u2018cool\u2019 reflection\u201d. How we can then\n\u201csee\u201d, \u201cread\u201d and interpret the emotions of\nothers based on their expressions and actions, is a matter of\nsustained analysis of Stein, developed in her account of empathy.\n2.3 Other Minds, Empathy and Social Cognition\n\nStein is best known for her work on empathy, understood broadly as the\napprehension of other subjects. Her contemporaries, such as Scheler or\nWalther, repeatedly refer to her dissertation (1917). Today, too, it\nis her notion of empathy that is increasingly discussed and viewed as\none the most nuanced phenomenological accounts, on a par with\nHusserl\u2019s and Scheler\u2019s analyses.\n\nMost generally defined, empathy, for Stein, is the basic form in which\nother embodied, experiencing subjects are given to us. Empathy is not\nmerely an epistemological tool for accessing other subjects or merely\nregistering their existence as minded beings; rather, empathy is\nitself a distinctive intentional experience. Whereas much of the\nepistemological debate of the knowledge of other minds is precisely\nbased on the mootness of the question of whether there are other minds\nor how our knowledge of their existence and their content can be\njustified, Stein observes that any debate revolving around the nature\nof empathy rests on the tacit assumption that other minds (but not\nmerely as \u201cminds\u201d) are indeed experientially given to us\n(1917:11\u201313[3\u20135]).\n\nStein conceives of such empathetic acts as a sui generis type\nof intentional experience directed at the experiential life of other\npersons. Empathic acts are sui generis; they are neither\ncomposed of nor reducible to other types of intentional acts (Stein\n1917: 16\u201320[8\u201311]). They are also distinctive in the way\nthey present their object and content: even though the intentional\nexperiences of the other are not first-personally \u201clived\nthrough\u201d in empathy (or, in phenomenological jargon,\n\u201coriginarily\u201d (origin\u00e4r) or\n\u201cprimordially\u201d given to the empathizer), empathic acts are\nexperienced first-personally. In that sense, empathy is an\noriginary intentional act, however, it presents non-originary\n(nicht origin\u00e4r) contents (1917: 15\u201316[7\u20138];\n51[34]). And yet, the non-originary contents given to me are\nnot non-originary simpliciter, but rather the originary\ncontents of another subject (1917: 24[14]; 28[17]). It is\ndue to this peculiar nature of intentional presentation of\nanother\u2019s experiences that empathy always preserves a self-other\ndifferentiation, and, indeed, involves an awareness of such on the\npart of the empathizing subject (1917: 27\u201329[16\u201318]).\n\nImportantly, the fact that empathy is a sui generis form of\nintentional experience doesn\u2019t preclude it having a\nmulti-layered structure, sharing characteristic features with other\nintentional acts (notably, perception, imagination, memory, and even\nanticipation of own future experiences), amounting to more complex\nforms of interpersonal understanding. Quite the contrary: One of the\nchief merits of Stein\u2019s account is that she offers a\nmulti-dimensional account of empathy that doesn\u2019t stop short at\ndescribing empathy as \n\n\nthe experience of foreign consciousness in general, irrespective of\nthe kind of the experiencing subject or of the subject whose\nconsciousness is experienced. (1917: 20[11])\n\n\nSpecifically, Stein argues for the following three claims: \n\n there is a basic form of empathy that shares key features with\nordinary (outer-)perception without being reducible to it; \n our empathetic experience is not limited to its basic form but\nincludes more complex forms of empathetic understanding; \n empathy must be markedly distinguished from further types of\nother-directed acts, such \u201cfellow feeling\u201d or\n\u201cfeeling-with\u201d (Mitf\u00fchlen) (as in \u201cI\nfeel your grief\u201d) or sympathy (\u201cI feel with your\nloss\u201d) and compassion, as well as from imitation or mimicry,\nemotional contagion, affective unification or\n\u201cfeeling-one-with\u201d (Einsf\u00fchlen), and finally\nfrom forms of \u201cfeeling together\u201d or emotional sharing\n(Miteinanderf\u00fchlen) (\u201cWe grieve for our\nloss\u201d). \n\n\nLet us briefly unpack these claims and point to some connections\nbetween them.\n\n(1) Basic empathy: Stein holds a nuanced version of what\ntoday is called the \u201cdirect perception\u201d account of social\ncognition According to this account, in typical interpersonal\nencounters, we can directly perceive that another is in a\nparticular mental, psychological or affective state (Dullstein\n2013; for some recent accounts, see Gallagher 2008; Smith 2010; Zahavi\n2011; Krueger 2012; Krueger & Overgaard 2012; Varga 2020).\nIn order to grasp, say, that my interlocutor is embarrassed, I do not\nneed to activate any cognitive processes other than perceptual ones.\nIn particular, I do not need to engage in complex inferential\nprocesses, explicit recollection drawing on one\u2019s own\nexperiences, or in any conscious imaginative perspective-taking or\nnon-conscious simulation process. Rather, I can directly\n\u201csee\u201d another\u2019s embarrassment in her blushing or her\nchange of voice. I thus grasp the other\u2019s experience in and\nthrough her communicative or bodily comportment, including her\ngestures, modulations in tonality of speech, or facial expression.\nStein restricts her analysis to those forms of comportment that the\nother enacts with a communicative intention and which express\nexperiences that she actually lives through and is aware of. However,\nStein suggests that it might also be possible to have an empathic\ngrasp of the other\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d by apprehending\nher \u201cwhole outer habitus, her manner of moving and her\nposture\u201d (see also below) (1917: 96[78]).\n\nNow, in the contemporary theory of mind debate on mindreading (Davies\n& Stone 1995a, 1995b), the direct perception account has been\npitched against the \u201ctheory theory of mind\u201d and\n\u201csimulation theory\u201d. According to the theory theory of\nmind, roughly, one infers another\u2019s mental life by attributing\nto her certain beliefs and desires on the basis of a\n(folk-psychological) \u201ctheory of mind\u201d (e.g., Baron-Cohen\n1995). According to simulation theory, to explain and predict\nother\u2019s behavior, social cognizers run certain simulation\nprocesses and create so-called \u201cpretend states\u201d (beliefs,\ndecisions, etc.) in their own representational working model (their\nown mind), and project this mental model onto the other\u2019s mind\n(Gordon 1995), or automatically \u201creplicate\u201d the\nother\u2019s behavioral expression and tendencies by innate\nmirror-neurons (Gallese & Goldman 1998). Some have also proposed\n\u201chybrid\u201d explanations, combining elements of the theory\ntheory of mind and simulation theory (e.g., Goldman 2006). As\ndefenders of the direct perception account have rightly pointed out,\nboth accounts rely on the general, and problematic,\nassumption that other minds are inherently opaque and not directly\nobservable; only if we assume such an unobservability thesis, do we\nneed to refer to either conceptual inferences or mental simulation (or\nboth) for mindreading (Gallagher 2008; Zahavi 2011).\n\nBut how exactly is, say, the distress of another subject\nperceptible or given in a bodily countenance? Stein analyzes\nthe precise nature of the relation between expression and what is\nexpressed (1917: 93\u2013103[75\u201384]) and concludes that it must\nnot be conceived as any sort of referential, symbolic, associative or\ninferential relation. Rather, what empathic perception directly grasps\nis the \u201cunity\u201d between the bodily expression of an\nexperience and the experience itself (a unity that is also given to,\nand indeed experienced as a unity, by the other). The underlying\nphenomenological claim is that the other\u2019s body is not given\npurely as a physical entity (K\u00f6rper), a meaningless\n\u201ccontainer\u201d of experiential items, but as a lived body\n(Leib), as the visible field of always already\nexpressive phenomena. Accordingly, the distress is\n\u201cco-given\u201d in the distressed countenance, and the two\n\u201cform a natural unity\u201d (1917: 95[77]). The unobservability\nthesis only follows if we assume that the only directly visible\nproperties of another person are the meaningless physical events that\nthe body is displaying. Once we appreciate that we are directly\ngrasping the sense of another\u2019s expressive bodily behavior in\nempathy, the need to refer to conceptual inferences or simulation\nprocesses to penetrate some allegedly opaque bodily barriers loses its\nmotivation.\n\nIn endorsing the direct perception account, Stein aligns with most\nclassical phenomenologists such as Scheler (1913/26), Husserl (e.g.,\n1952, 1973) or Merleau-Ponty (1945). Like these authors, she rejects\nboth the core tenet of one of the most influential theories of empathy\nof her time, namely Lipps\u2019 theory of empathic mimicry or\nimitation, which can be viewed as a forerunner of the simulation theory, and\nalso of Lipps\u2019 opponents, the so-called \u201ctheory of\ninference by analogy\u201d account, that she attributes to John\nStuart Mill (1917: 41[26]).\n\nAccording to the theory of inference by analogy, we infer from the\nobservation of the correlation of our own experiences to our own\nphysical body and its modifications that another\u2019s bodily\nmodifications, expressions and behavioral output must be also\ncorrelated with (particular) experiences. In contrast, Stein again\nclaims that it would be phenomenologically \u201cabsurd\u201d to\ndescribe our encounter with others as if we first perceive mindless\nbodies. Rather, perception-like empathy acquaints us ab ovo\nwith embodied minds.\n\nStein\u2019s argument against simulationist accounts and Lipps\u2019\nproto-simulationist account is more complex (see Stueber 2006 and\nZahavi 2010). For Lipps, when perceptually faced with a bodily gesture\nor the countenance of another, the empathizer feels a tendency to\n(inwardly) imitate the bodily contortion, a sort of innate\n\u201cinner imitation\u201d (Lipps 1903: 121; 1907: 718\u2013719;\n1909: 228). For Lipps, empathy, however, typically doesn\u2019t\nterminate in such mimicry. Rather, the automatically reproduced and\nprojected affect usually exerts an affective pull upon oneself, such\nthat one eventually comes to feel the other\u2019s emotion\n\u201cwith her\u201d. Lipps claims that empathic mimicry lies at the\norigin of the affective transference process and also that\n\u201cempathy directly involves a tendency to co-experience\n(Miterleben)\u201d (1907: 721). Moreover, he holds that in a\nproper act of empathy there is only one I given, namely the\nempathizer\u2019s own experience that she projects upon the\nother. Only after stepping out of the empathic stance, does the\nempathizer cease to be \u201cbound\u201d to the empathic target. She\nthen faces the other as an object, whereby a \u201cdivision\u201d of\nthe initially unique I (Teilung jenes einen Ich) and an\n\u201cawareness of a plurality of individuals\u201d ensues (Lipps\n1909: 231). Stein clearly rejects this view: For, if we actually were\nto \u201cput ourselves in the place (an die Stelle von) of\nthe foreign subject\u201d, by way of \u201csuppressing\u201d that\nthere is another I and only eventually ascribe our own surrogate\nexperience to the other, we would only have a \u201csurrogate of\nempathy\u201d (1917: 24[14]). Grasping another\u2019s experiences\nentails a clear self/other distinction, which cannot be established by\nthe projection of one\u2019s own (reproduced) affects onto another,\nbut precisely involves empathy as an other-directed act.\nRelatedly, a \u201ctaking over\u201d of foreign affects by emotional\ncontagion\u2014which may or may not lead to an affective unification\n(Einsf\u00fchlung) with the other (cf. Stueber 2006:\n8)\u2014rather than facilitating empathic understanding actually\n\u201cprevents our turning toward or submerging ourselves in the\nforeign experience, which is the attitude characteristic of\nempathy\u201d (1917: 36[23]; 1917: 35\u201336[22\u201324]).\n\n(2) Beyond basic empathy: For Stein, empathy is not limited\nto a direct-perceptual grasp of another\u2019s bodily comportment or\nexpression. Rather, a more detailed empathic explication involves a\nform of experiential reenactment of the other\u2019s experiencing and\na form of perspective-taking that is similar to, but not reducible to,\nimagination. Another\u2019s experiences have their own thick\nqualitative and motivational contents, which exert a certain\nmotivational \u201cpull\u201d on me, namely to\n\u201cexplicate\u201d them further, in order to properly\nunderstand them. \n\nStein conceives of the empathic encounter as a three-step-process. The\nempathizer need not run through all of them, and may repeat any of the\nsteps, depending on the situation or her interest in dwelling deeper\non the experiential life of the other. The process involves: \n\n the emergence or appearing of the other\u2019s experience\n(Auftauchen des Erlebnisses) in and through her bodily\ncomportment and expression; here, the experience is immediately given\nto the empathizer in direct perception but is still largely\nunspecified as to the other\u2019s further dispositions, motivations,\netc.; \n the empathizer may then bring this unspecified experience to an\nexplicative fulfillment (erf\u00fcllende Explikation);\nand,\n to a \u201csynthesizing objectification (zusammenfassende\nVergegenst\u00e4ndlichung) of the explicated experience\u201d\n(1917: 19[10]), which can then be reflected and dwelled upon. \n\n\nFirst, I encounter the other\u2019s sadness, apprehended directly in\nher posture, her facial expression or her tears, which are given to me\nperceptually; building on this apprehension, I eventually explicate\nthe experience, the mood, etc., that has led the other to experiencing\nthe sadness, and I myself experientially fill out the\nnecessary details; finally, the explicated experience is given to me\nas the experience of another subject, and thus \u201cfaces me\u201d\nas a proper intentional object (1917: 19[10], 51[34]).\n\nStein describes the second step \u201cas being at the foreign I and\nexplicating her experience by reliving it through\u201d (1917:\n51[34]). Importantly, as Stein maintains in her criticism of Lipps, we\nshould not understand this in a way that compromises the\nself/other-distinction presupposed in empathy and amounts to an\naffective unification or fusion with the other\n(Einsf\u00fchlung) (1917: 22\u201323[13\u201314];\n27\u201329[16\u201318]). In empathically reenacting another\u2019s\nexperiences, I am \u201c\u2018alongside\u2019 the other\u201d\n(\u201cbei\u201d ihm) but never \u201cone\nwith\u201d (eins mit) her (1917: 28[16]).\n\nHowever, Stein holds that proper empathetic comprehension of\nthe other\u2019s experiences requires a third step, and in\nthis regard her account is not altogether different from Lipps\u2019.\nFor it is only with the third step, the \u201csynthesizing\nobjectification\u201d, that the sadness of the other is again given\nto me as an intentional object properly speaking, and which I can\neventually reflect upon (1917: 51[34]).\n\nAn important issue that remains unaddressed by Stein is whether we\nshould interpret the explicative, objectifying and reflective steps\ntwo and/or three as some form of imagination or imaginative\nperspective-taking. Stein nowhere explicitly characterizes either of\nthe two as imagination (unlike Adam Smith, for instance); the only\nhint we have to this effect is that, in dismissing Scheler\u2019s\n(1913/1926) notion of empathy as \u201cinner perception\u201d\n(innere Wahrnehmung), she suggests rather to use, if at all,\n\u201cinner intuition\u201d (innere Anschauung), as this\nlatter notion would capture the non-originality of foreign experiences\nas well as that of one\u2019s own recollected, anticipated and\nimagined experiences (1917: 51[34]). Presumably, Stein\nfollows Husserl who believes we may imaginatively fill out\nthe empathized experience but we do not necessarily have to do this\n(similar to the case of other \u201cempty intentions\u201d). (For\ndetailed analyses of this three-step process, see Dullstein 2013, Shum\n2012; Svenaeus 2016 and 2018; for an often ignored, but interesting\nalternative procedural description of the different steps of the\nempathic process of Stein, see Stein 1920/1924: 149\u2013175).\n\nWhat is, at any rate, beyond doubt is that none of the empathic steps\nentails simulation in Lipps\u2019 sense or in that of standard\ncontemporary simulationist accounts. (For a neo-Lippsian\nsimulation-theorist, however, that comes close to Stein\u2019s\naccount, see Stueber 2006; cf. Jardine 2015.)\n\nStein\u2019s multi-dimensional account attributes to empathy the\npower to grasp not only another\u2019s dispositions and motivations\nbut also the social context of a person\u2019s motivational nexus, as\nwell her personal character (1917: 132\u2013134[114\u2013116]; see Jardine 2015; Taipale 2015a,b; Jardine & Szanto 2017). What is\nmore, Stein argues that empathy\u2014precisely in cases when the\nother\u2019s experiential life is markedly different from one\u2019s\nown\u2014(epistemically) contributes to the \u201cconstitution of\none\u2019s own personhood\u201d (1917: 134[116]) and to one\u2019s\n\u201cself-evaluation\u201d. The reason is that \n\n\nwe not only learn to make ourselves into objects (\u2026) by empathy\nwith differently composed personal structures we become clear of what\nwe are not, what we are more of less than others. (1917: 134[116])\n\n\n(3) Distinguishing empathy: Stein not only rejects Lippsian\nsimulation theories but would also reject a neo-Lippsian understanding\nof empathy that has lately gained much currency, namely the view that\nempathy entails a form of affective sharing. According to a prominent\nversion of this account, empathy \n\n is itself an affective state and specifically one that involves,\namongst other features, \n a certain \u201cinterpersonal similarity\u201d, i.e., some\nrelevant similarity or isomorphism between the affective state of the\nsubject and that of the target of empathy, and \n a form of \u201ccare\u201d for the affective state of the\nother, which brings it closer to what is usually called sympathy\n(though it cannot be reduced to sympathy) \n\n\n(see Jacob 2011; De Vignemont & Jacob 2012; De Vignemont &\nSinger 2006).\n\nIndeed, we can find resources in Stein\u2019s work for developing, as\nSvenaeus (2018) suggests, a notion of \u201csensual\u201d and\n\u201cemotional\u201d empathy, and empathy, at least typically, has\nsome \u201csensual basis\u201d (cf. 1920/1924: 164\u2013165; 1917:\n108[92], 127[109]). And yet, there is nothing to suggest that we\nshould characterize Steinian empathy generally as a\n\u201cfeeling\u201d, even if one were to distinguish\n(non-intentional) feelings from (intentional) emotions, as Svenaeus,\nalbeit in different ways as Stein proposes (see\n sect. 2.2,\n Stein 1917: 117[98]). Rather, according to Stein, we need to properly\ndistinguish the sensual basis, the perceptual and more complex\ncognitive components of empathic understanding, as well as empathy\ngrasping another\u2019s emotions and empathy grasping, say,\nanother\u2019s motivations or doxastic attitudes.\n\nMoreover, Stein and her fellow phenomenologists are careful not to\nconflate empathy with other forms of interpersonal and collective\nengagements\u2014be they empathy-based (such as sympathy, collective\nintentionality, fellow-feeling or shared emotions) or not\nempathy-based, pre-intentional or subpersonal forms of\nintersubjectivity (such as mimicry or emotional contagion). Having\nsaid this, there are a number of points of agreement between Stein and\nthe emotional empathy account. In particular, three points should be\nborne in mind: \n\nStein would certainly not contradict the point raised by Svenaeus\nthat empathy of the emotional type facilitates sympathy. Yet, there is\nnothing to indicate in Stein that only affectively poised empathic\nstance towards the other (what Svenaeus (2018) calls \u201csensual\nempathy\u201d) or empathy with an emotion of the other (what he calls\n\u201cemotional empathy\u201d) will result in sympathetic\nfeeling-with. \nStein probably would also agree that \u201csharing\u201d the\nothers\u2019 emotional state, in the sense of affectively\nre-experiencing it, might enhance our understanding of the other.\nHowever, again, empathic understanding doesn\u2019t necessarily\nrequire such sharing. Moreover, to refer to (affectively)\nre-experiencing another\u2019s emotions as \u201csharing\u201d\nunduly deflates properly joint- or \u201cwe\u201d-forms of emotional\nsharing. This brings us to the final point, \nIt is certainly true that Stein acknowledges various forms of\n\u201cwe\u201d-intentionality, including experiential and emotional\nones (see\n sect. 2.4),\n and she also holds that the latter necessarily presuppose some form\nof empathy (see Zahavi 2014, 2015). But that just reiterates the point\nthat the two forms of relating to others are not identical.\n\n2.4 Collective Intentionality and Social Ontology\n\nStein\u2019s contribution to the philosophy of sociality goes far\nbeyond her investigation of interpersonal or empathic relations.\nThough empathy is a necessary basis for any form of sociality, it is\ncertainly not sufficient for all forms of being-together. Accordingly,\nin her two books, Beitr\u00e4ge zur philosophischen\nBegr\u00fcndung der Psychologie and Geisteswissenschaft (1922)\nand Eine Untersuchung \u00fcber den Staat (1925), Stein\ndiscusses a complex range of social entities and facts and the\nmechanisms that constitute them. Initially, Stein follows her\nphenomenological contemporaries (Scheler 1916/1926), as well as\nearlier social psychologists (Le Bon 1895) and sociologists\n(T\u00f6nnies 1887/1935; Simmel 1908; Litt 1919) in distinguishing\nthree general \u201ctypes of socialization\u201d\n(Vergesellschaftung) (1922: 110[130]): the \u201cmass\u201d\nor \u201ccrowd\u201d (Masse), \u201csociety\u201d\n(Gesellschaft), and \u201ccommunity\u201d\n(Gemeinschaft) (1922: 230\u2013246[283\u2013295]; see\nSzanto forthcoming). But Stein not only adds to this her systematic\nanalysis of the state (1925) (see\n sect. 4.1),\n in her treatise on \u201cIndividual and Community\u201d (1922), she\noffers an unprecedentedly fine-grained phenomenological analysis of\nthe cognitive, experiential, intentional, volitional, affective and\nmoral life of communities in general. Before elaborating the nature of\ncommunities, let us briefly demarcate it from the crowd and societies\nor associations.\n\nRoughly, crowds are ad-hoc and temporary social formations, chiefly\ncharacterized by automatic mimicry of one another\u2019s emotional\nexpression and behavior. These eventually converge, not by being\ncentered on a common goal or by sharing collective intentions, but by\nso-called \u201cpsychic\u201d or emotional \u201ccontagion\u201d\n(1922: 148\u2013159[175\u2013191]). Typically, individuals will not\neven be aware of the psychodynamics at play. This makes them prone to\n\u201cmass contagion\u201d and \u201cmass suggestion\u201d(Stein\n1922: 201\u2013212[241\u2013261]).\n\nIn sharp contrast to crowds stand the two main \u201ctypes of\nliving-together\u201d (1925: 5[2]): society, with its various forms\nof institutional associations, and community. Both involve what today\nis usually called \u201ccollective intentionality\u201d (Jankovic\n& Ludwig 2017). Though they are not exclusive and typically come\nin \u201cmixed forms\u201d, there are crucial differences between\nthe two: Societal formations are essentially instrumental associations\nof individuals who treat each other \u201cas objects\u201d;\nwhereas, in communities, individuals encounter each other \u201cas\nsubjects\u201d and as \u201cliving with one another\u201d\n(1922: 111[131]; cf. 236\u2013243[283\u2013291]). In associations\nindividuals are bound together by common, but often purely\negoistic, interests and pursue their common goal by way of\n\u201crational\u201d and \u201cmechanistic\u201d planning. In\ncontrast, communities are bound by \u201cthe bond of\nsolidarity\u201d (ibid.). This entails that the members are\n\u201copen\u201d (ge\u00f6ffnet) towards each other and\n\u201clet each other\u2019s attitudes and evaluations penetrate one\nanother and deploy their mutual influence on each other\u201d. Thus,\nsolidarity is not some \u201cstatic\u201d bond but must be\ndynamically maintained (1922: 177\u2013178[194]).\n\nFor Stein, the solidarity required for communal life is\nexperientially grounded. Members of a community can only\nconstitute a true community of solidarity if they are bound together\nby so-called \u201ccommunal experiences\u201d\n(Gemeinschaftserlebnisse), and jointly constitute a so-called\na \u201csupra-individual\u201d (\u00fcberindividuell) or\n\u201ccommunal stream of experiences\u201d (Erlebnisstrom der\nGemeinschaft) (1922: 112\u2013122[133\u2013145]). This stream\nhas its own motivational and psychic-causational laws (1922:\n140\u2013148[167\u2013175]) and its own life-power (1922:\n167\u2013174[201\u2013210]).\n\nCommunities, according to Stein, can share intentions and\nvolitions and jointly perform actions (1922:\n159\u2013163[191\u2013196]). Moreover, communities can also\n\u201cfeel together\u201d, i.e., share emotions. Further,\ncommunities can share values (1922:\n189\u2013191[226\u2013228]) and are \u201cmoved by common\nmotives\u201d (1922: 178[215]). Their members can take\n\u201cevaluative and practical stances\u201d\n(Stellungnahmen) that pertain to the community (1922:\n176\u2013179[211\u2013214], 244[292]). They may even engage in\ncollective practices of imagination (1922:\n126\u2013127[147\u2013148]; cf. Szanto 2017). And they bear, though\nonly in a restricted sense (see below), \u201ccommon\nresponsibility\u201d (1922: 162\u2013163[195]; see Szanto\n2015b). Finally, communities even exhibit certain intellectual\ncapacities and virtues (e.g., having a distinctive esprit)\n(1922: 188\u2013189[225\u2013226]), and indeed, as Stein discusses\nin detail, bear a certain \u201cpersonality\u201d or personal\n\u201ccharacter traits\u201d (1922: 199[238];\n219\u2013221[262\u2013264]; 227\u2013236[272\u2013283]). \n\nFor Stein, then, communities can exhibit the same types of\nintentional experiences that individuals can, and be\nattributed all the same spiritual, axiological, psychic, and indeed\npersonal features. In order to see the full implication of this bold\nclaim, and in particular, the genuinely collective dimension\nof communal experiences, consider the following example:\n\n I empathize or sympathize with your grief for\nyour dead child.\n I (individually/personally) grieve for our child.\n I, as a parent, grieve for our child.\n We, parents, grieve for our child.\n\n\nIn (a), we have an interpersonal relation founded on empathy,\nwith no form of sharing whatsoever (see\n sect. 2.3).\n In (b), there is a shared intentional object, but no shared\nexperience of relating to it. With (c), we are getting closer\nto the phenomenon, but we still only have a shared object and what\nmight be called \u201csocial identification\u201d, whereby an\nindividual\u2019s experience is in some sense affected by the fact\nthat she conceives of herself as a member of a group. \n\nIn Stein\u2019s account, communal experiences are experiences in the\nsense of (d). Stein offers a multi-dimensional account of communal\nexperiences. Following three core aspects of intentional acts, it has\nbecome customary to distinguish content or object,\nsubject and mode accounts of collective\nintentionality (see Schweikard & Schmid 2013). A distinctive\nfeature of Stein\u2019s account is that she refuses to locate the\nseat of sharedness in any of these three dimensions in isolation.\nInstead, she investigates their interconnections. What\u2019s more,\nshe offers an elaboration of the mechanisms responsible for\nconjoining both individual experiences into a communal stream\nand their various interconnections within that stream.\nSpecifically, Stein discusses the distinctively collective nature of\n\n\n supra-individual objects; \n the collective intentional acts directed upon these\nobjects and their sharedness; \n the irreducibly communal content of collective\nexperiences; and \n the nature and mechanisms underlying their integration into a\ncommunal stream of experiences. \n\n\nLet us elaborate these in turn:\n\n(1) Supra-individual objects: The first requirement for\ncollective experiences is fairly straightforward; as Stein puts it,\n\n\n\nthe essence of communal life [lies] precisely in the fact that the\nsubjects are not directed at one another, but jointly turned toward an\nobjectivity (einem Gegenst\u00e4ndlichen zugewendet). (1922:\n225[270]) \n\n\nThis delimits the range of possibly shared experiential states: Only\nexperiences that have intentional objects can be shared.\nConcerning affective experiences, only those that appraise objects,\nevents, etc. with evaluative properties can be shared, viz.\nintentional feelings (e.g., grief, joy, fear, etc.), moods and\nsentiments (e.g., confidence, trust, admiration). Purely sensory\nfeelings (e.g., pain, sensory pleasure or bodily excitement), tied to\nindividuals\u2019 felt body location and lacking extra-bodily\nintentional objects, cannot be shared (1922:\n137\u2013139[163\u2013165]). However, as we will see, communities\ncan indeed be attributed life-feelings and psychic and spiritual\nlife-power of their own.\n\n(2) Collective intentional acts: The second distinctive\nfeature of communal experiences for Stein is what might be called\ndouble-direction of collective intentionality. First, there\nis the ordinary intentional focus upon the shared, supra-individual\nobject. Second, in every communal experience, individual members\ninstantiate an \u201cintention upon the communal experience\u201d\n(Intention auf das Gemeinschaftserlebnis) (1922: 116[137]).\nFor example, when grieving together, my experience is not only about\nor directed upon \u201cour loss\u201d but at the same time on the\nfact that we share the experience of the loss.\n\n(3) Communal content: That individual intentions are jointly\ndirected upon the same object means also that they have a\n\u201ccontent of communal experience\u201d (Gehalt des\nGemeinschaftserlebnisses) (1922: 116[137]): \u201ca unity of\nsense.\u201d (1922: 117[138]). The unitary sense does not\nexclude, however, fine-grained individual variations in the\nexperiential content. All that is required of the individuals is that\ntheir experiences have the same \u201ccore of sense\u201d\n(Sinnkern) (1922: 117[136\u2013137];\n138\u2013139[164\u2013165]). This allows for \u201cmanifold\u201d\nindividual \u201cexperiential coloring\u201d\n(Erlebnisf\u00e4rbung) (1922: 113[134f.], 115[136]). On the\nother hand, individuals\u2019 experiences are just as much colored by\nthe fact that they don\u2019t have the respective experience\nprivately, but precisely as members or \u201cin the name\nof\u201d (1922: 114[134]) the community. This \u201creciprocal\nfeedback\u201d (R\u00fcckwirkung; 1922: 132[157]) or\ncoloring of the personal by the communal can be best understood\ncounterfactually: Individuals would not have the (same) experiences\nthey have if they were not members of a given community, or were there\nno community (at some time or another). And there is a normative\ndimension to this unity: shared intentionality has conditions of\nfulfillment that are determined by what is an appropriate intentional\nresponse, given (a) the specific intentional object and (b) the\nspecific community at stake (see Szanto 2015a):\n\n\nThe intention to realize the communal experience can be fulfilled much\nmore extensively than the intention to do justice to what is demanded\nby the object \u2013for instances in cases where the content of the\ncommunal experience falls considerably short of what is required of\nit. On the other hand, the content of the individual experience can\nvery closely approximate what is required by the supra-individual\nobject, and yet by no means does it need to coincide with the content\nof the communal experience. This can be the case because (\u2026),\nfor example the event in question (\u2026) can be falsely evaluated\nby single members as to its significance for the community. (\u2026)\n[In that case there is] divergence of the individual contents from the\nintended collective content (\u2026). (1922:\n116\u2013117[137\u2013138])\n\n\n(4) Communal stream of experiences: What about the\nsubject of the communal experiences and the notorious\ncommunal stream of experiences into which individual\nmembers\u2019 experiences are embedded? To begin with, notice that\nthe communal stream is founded upon the \u201ccontribution\u201d\nwith which the individual experiences \u201cfurnish\u201d it (1922:\n138[164\u2013165]; see also 119[141], 121\u2013122[143\u2013145]); it\ndoes not exist above and beyond these contributions.\n\u201cContribution\u201d must not be understood as a sort of\nsummative piling-up or aggregation of individual experiences (see also\nKrebs 2020): \u201cthe relation between individual and\ncommunal experiences is constitution, not summation\u201d (1922:\n122[144]). Moreover, Stein warns us not to misunderstand her notion of\n\u201ccommunal subject\u201d (Gemeinschaftssubjekt) as if\nthere were some supra-individual \u201cowner\u201d, or some\n\u201csuper-ego\u201d: \u201ca community-subject, as analogue of\nthe pure ego, does not exist\u201d (ibid.). Similarly, there is\nalways also a plurality of supra-individual\nexperiential streams, which do not unite into one single communal\nstream constituted by some \u201csuper-community\u201d or the entire\ncommunity of all conscious beings. (1922:\n139\u2013140[165\u2013166]).\n\nNow, the supra-individual stream must not be confused with a\ncollective consciousness. For consciousness is a\nconstituting rather than a constituted phenomenon;\nfollowing Husserl, Stein holds that the constituting\nconsciousness\u2014the \u201cultimately constituting stream\u201d\nof experiences (letztkonstituierender Flu\u00df)\u2014is\nessentially egoic, and ipso facto individual in nature (1922:\n118\u2013119[140\u2013141]). Accordingly, the communal stream is as\na constituted stream, constituted by individual\u2019s\n\u201cpure egos\u201d. And yet, in communal experiences, the\nrespective subjects of experience and the \u201cindividual\npersonality\u201d of the members are modified in a certain way and\nimpacted by the very communal experience. In terms of the modified\nsubject of communal experiences, we must assume a certain\n\u201ccollective personality\u201d\n(Gesamtpers\u00f6nlichkeit; 1922: 114[135], see also 227[272]). A\ngood way to understand this claim is by considering the distinction\nbetween the \u201cphenomenal\u201d and the \u201contic\nsubject\u201d of shared experiences (Schmid 2009: 65ff.). While the\nphenomenal subject of the communal stream is a communal one, its ontic\nbearers are the individual members (1922: 114[134]). (This\ncertainly should not imply that Stein holds that all\nconstitution, and in particular the constitution of the shared values\nand objects, or the life-world, is reducible to individual processes.\nQuite the contrary: Like virtually all phenomenologists, Stein\nstresses the importance of intersubjective constitution, which is\naccomplished precisely by communities of individuals acting together; 1922: 139\u2013140[165\u2013166].)\n\nLarge parts of Stein\u2019s treatise are devoted to further\nspecifying the \u201cstructure\u201d of communal experiences (1922:\n112\u2013122[133\u2013145]), the \u201celements\u201d it contains\n(such as imaginations, categorical acts, intentional feelings, etc.)\n(1922: 122\u2013139[145\u2013165]), the mechanisms integrating the\nindividual experiences into the unified communal stream (1922:\n139\u2013147[165\u2013175]; 159\u2013163[191\u2013196]), and\nfinally its own personal, psychic and spiritual life (1922:\n163\u2013199[196\u2013238]) (see also Burns 2015; Caminada 2015).\nRoughly, the communal stream has a temporally structured internal\ncoherence, with its own \u201cassociative\u201d,\n\u201cmotivational\u201d, and \u201ccausal\u201d mechanisms\nconjoining the individual experiences into an experientially coherent\n\u201cintegrate\u201d (1922: 141\u2013147[167\u2013175]).\nExperiences also affect one another by \u201cpsychic\u201d and\n\u201cvolitional causation\u201d (1922:\n159\u2013163[191\u2013196]). Accordingly, the communal stream\nexhibits its own life-feelings as well as psychic and spiritual\nlife-power (1922: 145\u2013147[172\u2013175]; 167\u2013185[201\u2013203]). Communities can be more or less\nproductive, energized, etc., depending on the contribution of the\nlife-power of the participating individuals. In turn, the communal\nlife-power feeds back on the individuals\u2019 life-power (see\nM\u00fcller 2020).\n\nThough the individuals\u2019 mental and psychic life (incl. their\nattitudes, life-power) are variously influenced\u2014and indeed, in\ntheir social identity, or as members of a community\nco-determined\u2014by communal life, their autonomous\n(affective and moral) psychology is never \u201coutflanked\u201d or\n\u201coverridden\u201d (Pettit 1993) by the community (1922:\n234[280], 247[296], 224\u2013227[268\u2013271]). Just as they never\nlose their \u201cindividual distinctiveness\u201d (1922: 226[271]),\nindividuals are never \u201ccleared\u201d of their (moral)\nresponsibility for their individual or communal deeds by the\ncommunity. Communal responsibility for Stein doesn\u2019t simply\n\u201csuspend\u201d individual responsibility (1922:\n162\u2013163[194\u2013196]; 225[269]) Thus, despite occasional\nappearances to the contrary, which may result from misleading notions\nsuch as a \u201ccharacter\u201d, or \u201cpersonality of the\ncommunity\u201d (1922: 227[272]), Stein\u2019s account of community\nsteers clear of any problematic form of collectivism (see Szanto 2015b\nand forthcoming).\n\nIn conclusion, Stein\u2019s account of collective intentionality is\nof continued interest to the contemporary landscape. In particular,\nshe offers a middle-way between the Scylla of methodologically\nindividualist or reductionist accounts and the Charybdis of\ncollectivist or fusional accounts (e.g., Schmid 2014; Krueger 2016) of\nshared experience. At the same time, she specifies different types and\nlayers of experiential sharing, their normative dimension and the\nvarious (intentional, cognitive, affective, etc.) mechanisms\nresponsible for integrating them.\n3. Phenomenological Ontology and Philosophical Anthropology\n3.1 The Question of Being\n\nFollowing her conversion in 1922, Stein immersed herself in Christian\nphilosophy, especially St. Thomas Aquinas, translating De\nVeritate (Stein 2008a,b). Having \u201cfound a home in\nAquinas\u2019s thought world\u201d (Stein 1931: 4[3]), but remaining\nloyal to phenomenology, she sought to integrate phenomenology with\nThomism which she did in an original way, connecting Husserl\u2019s\nconcept of spirit (Geist) with the Christian personal God.\nHusserl proceeds from the transcendental standpoint of the meditating\nego, Aquinas\u2019 position is naive realism. Stein, therefore,\ncriticized Husserlian transcendental philosophy for seeking to\nestablish objectivity from within subjectivity (1993: 33[32]). Her\nphenomenological ontology, furthermore, offered a Christian\nalternative (\u201cinfinite Being\u201d) to Heidegger\u2019s\naccount of being as finitude. Stein\u2019s ontology is found\nprimarily in Potency and Act (1931) and Finite and\nEternal Being (1950/2006), both of which contain original\ndiscussions of essence (Wesen) and of being (Sein)\nthat deserve fuller examination over and against Heidegger or\nConrad-Martius\u2019s accounts.\n\nStein defines ontology as the science of the \u201cbasic forms of\nbeing and of beings\u201d (2000c: 161[182]). In agreement with Aquinas\nand Husserl, she holds that ontological concepts can be discovered by\n\u201clogical reasoning\u201d (1931: 17[22]). She begins from\nHusserl\u2019s distinction between formal and material ontologies.\nFormal ontology, for Stein, considers being simply as\n\u201dbeing\u201d, that which is. Thus it arrives at the formal\nnotion of \u201csomething that is\u201d or just\n\u201csomething\u201d (1931: 22[28]). Formal ontology, for Stein,\nfollowing Husserl, studies formal principles such as\n\u201cact\u201d, \u201cpotency\u201d, \u201cobject\u201d,\n\u201cindividual\u201d, and so on. Formal ontology identifies a\npriori conceptual truths such as: \u201conly a perfectly simple whole\ncan be absolutely actual\u201d (1931: 38[52]). Stein identifies three\nfundamental ontological forms: \u201cobject\u201d\n(Gegenstand), \u201cwhat\u201d (Was), and\n\u201cbeing\u201d (Sein; 1931: 99[147]). Stein\ndistinguishes between the species and the concrete individual.\nIndividual entities have \u201cthisness\u201d or haeccitas\n(1931: 29[39]). Invoking Dun Scotus, Stein speaks of\nhaeccitas, and of \u201cindividual essence\u201d\n(Einzelwesen; 1950/2006: 79[81]), a concept she also finds in\nHusserl. Paradoxically, there is an essence that is responsible for\nsomething being an individual, a particular \u201cthis\u201d. Things\nhave a \u201cpossibility of essence\u201d\n(Wesensm\u00f6glichkeit, Stein 1950/2006: 80[83]), the\ncapacity to actualize their nature. For Stein, from consideration of\none\u2019s own being and non-being, one can grasp the notion of\nactuality and possibility and then argue for the possibility\nof full actuality as is found in divine being.\n\nFor Stein, \u201cGod is pure spirit and the archetype of all\nspiritual being\u201d (2003: 127[153]). The essence of divine being\nis to be \u201ctri-personal\u201d (1950/2006: 352). God is\n\u201cBeing-in-Person, indeed the\nBeing-in-three-Persons\u201d (1950/2006: 307[359]). Spirit in\ngeneral, furthermore, is \u201csuperabundant, diffusive life\u201d\n(1950/2006 351[380]). The life of spirit as such is non-spatial\n\u201cmovement\u201d (1931: 117[169]). Spirit is active and dynamic\nand divine being is \u201ca movement from the inside out (\u2026) a\ngenerating being (\u2026) eternal self-drawing and\nself-creating\u201d (Sich-selbst-sch\u00f6pfen; 1950/2006:\n300[351]). All forms of spirit possess \u201cinnerness\u201d\n(Inneres; Stein 1950/2006: 307[360]) and \u201cgoes out from\nitself\u201d. Spirit as such has \u201cself-shaping\u201d power\n(Gestaltungskraft; 1931: 122[175]) and its essence is to be\n\u201cself-giving\u201d. Spirit, for Stein, then, is\n\u201cbeing-in-itself\u201d (Sein in sich selbst),\n\u201cfor itself\u201d, and \u201cfrom itself\u201d (a\nse). All other beings that are spiritual are founded in this\ndivine spirit and have their \u201carchetypes\u201d there\n(Urbilder; 1950/2006: 307[360]). Ultimately, all forms of\nspirit form a unity.\n\nStein defends the reality of essences. An essence is not just a name,\nrather a name is an expression of an essence. Concepts are\nhuman inventions; essences are not (1950/2006: 62[66]). The formation\nof concepts is based on grasping the essences (Stein 1950/2006:\n72[73]). The being of essences, however, is inefficacious and\npotential. What is real or actual is the individual. Stein\u2019s\nexample of essence is \u201cjoy\u201d. Joy becomes actual and\nefficacious because of its essence, which is timeless (1950/2006:\n91[95]). There exists an individual\u2019s joy. There is no such\nthing in the real world as \u201cjoy in general\u201d (1950/2006:\n75[76]); nevertheless, joy has an \u201cessentiality\u201d\n(Wesenheit; 1950/2006: 77[78]) that defines it and\ndistinguishes it from other emotions. Stein claims essences belong to\nobjects (e.g. my joy) but \u201cessentialities\u201d are\nideal and are independent of objects (e.g., joy as such) (1950/2006:\n72[73]). An object without an essence is unthinkable (1950/2006:\n77[78]).\n\nStein, following both Husserl and Scheler, distinguishes between the\ngeneric or universal essence of a human being (the\n\u201cspecies\u201d \u2013 what all humans have in common) and the\nindividual essences of individual human beings. Explicitly departing\nfrom Aquinas, Stein defends the concept of the essence of the\nindividual, the differentiation of individuals through spiritual\nmatter, and the idea of the \u201cunfolding\u201d or\n\u201cblooming\u201d (Entfaltung; 1931: 139[209]) of the\nsoul from its core or seed. In Finite and Eternal Being,\nStein discusses the \u201cindividual essence\u201d\n(individuelles Wesen) of Socrates (1950/2006: 142[157]), a\ndeterminate form distinct from the general, specific form of\nbeing-human. The form of Socrates unfolds within specific\npossibilities contained in its quite determinate essence. The real\nSocrates may be different from the man depicted by Plato.\n\u201cBeing-Socrates\u201d and\n\u201cbeing-the-Platonic-Socrates\u201d are distinct essences,\ndifferent possible \u201cforms\u201d of unfolding of what Socrates\nis (1950/2006: 142\u2013143[157\u2013158]). The essence\nunfolds itself in its faculties and capacities (later called\nits \u201cpotentiality\u201d). Stein distinguishes between\n\u201cunfolding\u201d (Entfaltung) and\n\u201cdevelopment\u201d (Entwicklung). A person\nunfolds from an essence that is already there. Development\nrefers to other kinds of movement, including the Darwinian idea of\nevolution, with which Stein (and also Scheler) was broadly familiar\nand which she discussed in her anthropology.\n\nStein further distinguishes between \u201cspecies\u201d (understood\nas Aquinas\u2019 \u201cforms\u201d which are permanent and\nunalterable categories (2000c: 151[173]), and what she calls, following\nHusserl, \u201ctypes\u201d. Types can vary within the limits defined\nby the species. A single person can exemplify many types,\ne.g., by age, social status, etc. Stein maintains that each\nentity\u2014from a plant to an animal or human being\u2014has an\ninner \u201cform\u201d (Gestalt) that determines it to\nbecome the thing it is\u2014just as individual seeds become beech\ntrees or fir trees (2000c: 32[130]).\n\nThe subject is the \u201cbearer of spiritual life\u201d (1931:\n87[124]). Intentionality is the being of subjective spirit\n(1931 85[121]), i.e., it constitutes subjective spirit as such. There\nare two sides to spiritual being: \u201cbeing illumined\u201d\n(durchleuchtet) and \u201cbeing open\u201d\n(ge\u00f6ffnet) (1931: 104[154]). Intelligibility\n(intelligibilitas) is \u201cbeing illumined\u201d (1931:\n84[123]). \u201cKnowledge is something proper to spiritual\nbeing\u201d (1931: 111[165]) but spirit cannot be just knowing; it\nmust also have freedom of will (Stein 1950/2006: 341[402]). Stein\nclaims already in the Beitr\u00e4ge that spirit is openness\n(1922: 296[295\u2013296]; see also 1950/2006: 307\u2013308[360]):\nopenness for an objective world, which is experienced; and\nopenness for someone else\u2019s subjectivity, someone else\u2019s\nspirit. In Potency and Act, she maintains that \n\n\nbeing open for oneself and for what is other is the highest and hence\nalso the most proper form of spirit whereto all other spiritual being\nharks back. (1931: 175[255])\n\n\u201cBeing open\u201d means being able to engage what is other than\noneself, stand over against it, turn toward it intentionally. (1931:\n175[254]) \n\n\nStein\u2019s concepts of blooming, unfolding and openness are crucial\nfor understanding her \u201cessentialism\u201d in respect to gender\nor sex, as we shall discuss in\n Section 4.2\n below.\n3.2 The Nature of Persons\n\nStein was concerned with the nature of the \u201cperson\u201d from\nthe beginning of her career, inspired by her teachers Stern, Husserl,\nand Scheler. In Empathy, she argues for the\n\u201cconstitution\u201d of the person in emotional experiences;\nfeelings \u201cannounce personal attributes\u201d (Stein 1917:\n117[99]), whereas mere bodily sensations do not (see\n sect. 2.2).\n Persons are unities, and indeed instantiate value; and each person is\ncorrelated to a \u201cvalue-world\u201d (Wertwelt; 1917:\n136[108]). Her 1922 Beitr\u00e4ge extended her discussion of\npersons, developing a layered ontology of body, soul, and spirit, and\ndiscussing her concept of \u201clife-power\u201d in detail (see\n sect. 2.1).\n In her later works, Stein embeds her phenomenological account of\nconscious life into a more Thomistic metaphysical, but also\nexistential, conception of the person.\n\nStein agrees with Scheler that a person is\n\u201cvalue-sensitive\u201d or \u201cvalue-tropic\u201d\n(werthaftig; 1922: 190[227]) and has \u201cpermeability for\nvalues in general\u201d (1922: 190[227]). Persons are intrinsically\nvalue-dependent, value-recognizing, and value-producing beings:\n\u201cwe see what a person is when we see which world of value she\nlives in\u201d (1922: 190[227]). Love, for example, is an\napprehension of the value of the loved person. Emotions have the\ngreatest effect on the inner form of the self (1931: 260[381]).\nEmotions reveal reality in its \u201ctotality and in its\npeculiarity\u201d (2000c: 87[96]). The person is in part constituted\nthrough emotions; a non-emotive person is, for Stein, an\nimpossibility. The emotions, furthermore, enable us to grasp other\npersons as value-beings (see also\n sect. 2.2\n and\n sect. 2.3).\n\nFollowing Husserl, Stein maintains that the person actualizes itself\nin his or her uniquely personal acts, either self-directed acts, such\nas making a firm decision, or expressing oneself creatively, or\nother-directed acts, such as promising, forgiving, that recognize\nother persons as persons). Spiritual acts are acts that persons\naddress to each other as persons (something found also in\nHusserl\u2019s Ideas II). The whole person, however, is not\nexhausted in any of these acts (1931: 260[381]), but they spring from\nthe person\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d. A person has a depth beyond his\nor her acts. Having \u201cdepth\u201d is characteristic of the human\nsoul (1931: 266[390]). The soul can receive something at the depth\nappropriate to it; it has \u201cdepth-reception\u201d\n(Tiefen-Aufnahme, Stein 1931: 255[391]).\n\nStein also maintains that human beings are \u201cbeings in the\nworld\u201d (2000c: 155[177]). Persons are integrated into both the\nmaterial and the immaterial, spiritual worlds (1931: 147[221]):\n\u201cThe being of human beings is a composite of body, soul, and\nspirit\u201d (1950/2006: 310[363]). Humans are necessarily embodied;\nthe soul is \u201cbound to matter\u201d (stoffgebunden;\n1950/2006: 321[377]). Human spirits exhibit\n\u201cbeing-tied-to-the-body\u201d (Leibgebundenheit;\n1950/2006: 333[392]). Following Aristotle, she maintains that the body\nreceives its vitality through the soul (2000c: 86[94]). For Stein, the\nsoul is the principle of formation, animateness, nutrition, and\nreproduction. The soul, furthermore, grows primarily from its\naffective nature; he soul is conditioned by the body, but the spirit\ncan also condition and curb the emotions. In humans, the spirit is\ndependent on the senses for its natural activity. \u201cThe soul\ncannot live without receiving\u201d (Stein 1950/2006: 318[373]).\nHuman persons as spirits are intentionally influenced and formed\n\u201cfrom above\u201d(i.e., from purely spiritual motivations) and\nalso \u201cfrom below\u201d (1950/2006: 310[364]), i.e., from bodily\ndrives. Spirit arises from a \u201cdark ground\u201d, an\n\u201cobscure depth\u201d (1950/2006: 310[364]).\n\nFor Stein, the soul is not static and complete but evolving and\ndeveloping (Stein 2000c: 85\u20136[94]), fulfilling its innate\ncapacities. It is a living \u201croot\u201d (Wurzel) whose\ninnate capacities have to be activated. The human being actualizes\nitself in the acts that come from its subjectivity. Ordinary daily\nexistence conditions the soul and the spirit (Stein 2000c: 89[98];\n1931: 261[383]). Humans can repress actions and shape them. Stein\nmaintains that the soul has its own inner \u201copenness\u201d\n(1931: 266[390]): openness to other subjects but also, following\nScheler in particular, openness to value. The soul, however,\nmust be open to values to receive them (1922: 193[230]). The soul is\nmore important than the pure ego: \n\n\nThe pure ego is, as it were, only the portal through which the life of\na human being passes on its way from the depth of the soul to the\nlucidity of consciousness. (1950/2006: 420[501])\n\n\nPersons are psychic wholes or totalities that must be approached as\nsuch. \u201cEvery I is unique\u201d (Jedes Ich ist\nEinmaliges, 1950/2006: 294[343]) with its own\n\u201cpeculiarity\u201d (Eigent\u00fcmlichkeit), that is\nincommunicable, even though it also has a \u201cquid\u201d\nthat it shares with other egos. Every human being has\n\u201cunrepeatable singularity\u201d (2000c: 161[182]). In the human\nego, there is a contrast between \u201cego-life\u201d and\n\u201cbeing\u201d (1950/2006 296[345]). The ego is\n\u201ctransparent\u201d (durchsichtig) to itself\n(1950/2006: 296[345]). For Stein, every person is an ego, but not\nevery ego is a person. A person must be aware of itself and there may\nbe egos (e.g., animal egos) that do not have this self-awareness and\ntransparency. In this regard, to be a person requires a degree of\ndeveloping self-awareness.\n\nStein maintained throughout her work that each human being has an\nindividual personal \u201ccore\u201d (Kern der Person, see\n1931: 122[183]; Pers\u00f6nlichkeitskern; 1922: 80[92]) that\nremains unchanged and that contains potentiality that can be\nactualized. For the personal core, Stein drew on Teresa of Avila\n(\u201ccastle of the soul\u201d, die Seelenburg, Stein\n1950/2006: 315[370]), John of the Cross, Max Scheler, and Hedwig\nConrad-Martius. The person \u201cunfolds\u201d or\n\u201cripens\u201d but the personal core is never completely\n\u201cdisclosed or disclosable\u201d (1931: 139[200]). This core is\ndirectly knowable only by God. We only actualize some of it in our\nfinite lives, but, in contrast to Heidegger, we actually are\nthis deeper core. Our being has a wholeness which our finite life does\nnot exhaust.\n\nThe person\u2019s character properties are its capacities for\napprehending values, and in them the core unfolds itself outwards\n(entfaltet sich in ihnen nach au\u00dfen; 1922: 193[231]).\nKindliness as a character trait doesn\u2019t just show itself in kind\nactions; a person can be kindly even if he doesn\u2019t get to do\nkind actions (1922: 193[231]). Not everything in the person comes from\nthe core. Some experiences are \u201cproper to the I\u201d\n(ichlich) whereas others are \u201cforeign to the I\u201d\n(ichfremd, 1931: 129[186]). Here Stein draws heavily from\nHusserl. There are emotional and other sentient traits that are\n\u201cindifferent\u201d to the core (1922:\n191\u201392[228\u201329]). External impressions do not penetrate\ndeeply into my soul and have little personal involvement (1931:\n128[185]). The same sound can slip by me, but if I am concentrating,\nit can disturb me and make me angry (1931: 130[187]). It penetrates my\nperson and affects me inwardly. There are \u201cdepths of the\nI\u201d (1931 129[186]; also discussed in Empathy (1917) and\nBeitr\u00e4ge (1922) (see\n sect. 2.1\n and\n sect. 2.2).\n People live at different depth dimensions (1931: 130[188]). The more\na person lives at depth, the more his or her core will unfold. Stein\ndistinguishes not just between \u201csurface\u201d and\n\u201cdepth\u201d of the self but also between center and periphery.\nI may be concentrating and open a window to get air but don\u2019t\nfully notice myself doing it. Penetrating things with understanding is\na work of depth and is an \u201cachievement of the will\u201d (1931:\n131[190]).\n\nStein appropriated the notion of \u201clife\u201d (Leben)\nfrom Husserl, Scheler, Dilthey, and Bergson. Development of the person\ncontinues through life but the person does not cease after death\n(1931: 140[202]). The person enters eternity \u201cas what s/he has\nbecome\u201d (was sie geworden ist; 1931: 135[195]). In our\ninnermost feeling of being alive we remain the same\u2014from child\nto adult to old age (1931: 2[21]).\n4. Political and Feminist Thought\n4.1 Philosophy of State\n\nStein\u2019s treatise An Investigation Concerning the State\n(1925) completes her preoccupation with social reality\n(1917\u20131925). The aim of the book is to provide an\n\u201contic\u201d determination of the state as a form of sociality.\nThe guiding question Stein sets out to answer is what \u201ctype of\nliving together of subjects\u201d is distinctive of the state.\n\nAccording to Stein, the state cannot be grounded in either\n\u201csociety\u201d or in \u201ccommunity\u201d alone. Unlike\nsocieties or associations, a state cannot be brought into existence by\nany act of collective intentionality or \u201cvolition\u201d.\nPolitical entities, founded solely on such rational associations,\nwould at best be \u201cartificial\u201d quasi-states, permanently in\ndanger of dissolving, like the artificial territories drawn up on maps\nof colonial powers (1925: 81[107]). Stein aims to show that states\nwill be \u201cpeculiarly hollow and schematic\u201d if they are not\nin some sense or another grounded in communal forms of living together\n(1925: 32[37]). However, no \u201ccommunity of the\npeople\u201d\u2014be it an ethnically defined \u201cpeople\u201d\nor \u201cfolk\u201d or some other cultural community founded on\nshared values or languages\u2014is a necessary or sufficient\ncondition to constitute a state either. Accordingly, Stein argues both\nagainst classical contractualism \u00e0 la Rousseau, Locke or Hobbes\n(1925: 40[51]), that asserts a rational but decisionist creation\nof the state (Sch\u00f6pfung kraft eines Willk\u00fcraktes),\nand against traditionalist conceptions of some organic emergence of a\nstate. For Stein, there is no \u201ceither-or\u201d here: though\nstates may be factually \u201cgrounded\u201d in a community or a\nsociety, statehood is not constituted by either (1925:\n7\u20139[4\u20136]). The \u201cgravitational force [of a state]\nrests on its own\u201d (1925: 81[108]). Less metaphorically, a state\nconstitutes itself by its own sovereign act\n\nThe central thesis of the book, then, focuses on the\n\u201cequivalence of statehood and sovereignty\u201d (1925: 17[16]).\nSovereignty is not only the \u201cthe conditio sine qua non\nof the state\u201d (1925: 51[66]), it also represents its defining\nnature. A state is essentially a \u201csovereign sphere of\npower\u201d (Herrschaftssph\u00e4re) with its own\n\u201cgoverning state-power (Staatsgewalt)\u201d.\nSpecifically, the sovereignty of a state is a (self-)constitutive\npower, instituting not just the state as such, but also its law or\nrights (Recht). Hence, \u201cstate and law come to life at\nthe same time\u201d (1925: 48[62]). A state thus bears the exclusive\n\u201cright to institute laws\u201d (Recht, Recht zu\nsetzen) and determines the sphere of persons (and specific forms\nof their behavior) for whom those laws apply (1925: 34[40]).\n\nStein spends a considerable portion of the treatise specifying the\nnature of rights and law at stake. In particular, she differentiates\nbetween positive and pure law, subjective, natural, human and civil\nrights, discusses the function of the state in interpreting,\nenforcing, or adjudicating rights as well as the legal and ontological\nstatus of the state itself as a subject of law (1925: 40[51],\n56\u201373[73\u201396]). Drawing on Reinach (1913), she first distinguishes\n\u201cpure\u201d and \u201cpositive law\u201d. Pure law is\na-temporal and applies universally \u201cat all times and for all\npeoples\u201d (1925: 33[39]); whereas positive law is created by\nspontaneous decisions and hence can vary socio-historically. Based on\nthis distinction, Stein argues that, \u201cwherever there is no idea\nof a positive law, the idea of a state can (\u2026) neither be\ngrasped\u201d (1925: 64[84]).\n\nBut in what sense is the state, as a sovereign entity, the originator\n(Urheber) of its own (positive) rights and powers and in what\nsense is it a unitary \u201csubject of right\u201d\n(Rechtsubjekt) of its own? The gist of Stein\u2019s complex\nand somewhat ambivalent discussion (1925: 52\u201362[68\u201383]) is\nthat \u201cbeing a state means being a subject of\nrights\u201d (1925: 119[172]), namely in the sense of a\n\u201cjuridical person\u201d. Juridical persons are persons only in\na derivative sense; they derive their ability to perform \u201cfree\nacts\u201d, from fully-fledged individual (natural) persons (1925: 37[46]). The state, then, is the \n\n\nnon-personal entity, the subject, to which all [individual] rights,\ninasmuch they are of a positive-legal source, point back to as their\nultimate originator. (1925: 59[77]) \n\n\nOn the other hand, Stein applies her account of collective\nintentionality (see\n sect. 2.4)\n to the theory of the state as a \u201ccollective person\u201d\n(\u201cKollektiv-Person\u201d). A key assumption is that\nthe state can only be a unitary, sovereign subject \n\n\nif there is a sense, in which it can be claimed that it is, as a\ntotality (als Ganzes), author (Urheber) of\nits own acts. (1925: 37[46]) \n\n\nThe state, as a collective subject of right, represents individuals\nand communities, which empowers individuals, associations or\ninstitutions to act on behalf of the state. But they can only act on\nbehalf of the state if they are, in turn, \u201coffered\u201d to do\nso (angetragen) and thus legitimized by the state itself\n(1925: 38[47]). Moreover, individuals and communities must acknowledge\nor recognize (anerkennen) the state\u2019s self-institution\nand its executive and legislative powers.\n\nWith her detailed analysis of the sovereignty of the state and the\nspecific workings of its rule of law, Stein contributes in an original\nway to later\u2014and very different\u2014attempts to clarify the\nconcept of the state: in particular, Carl Schmitt\u2019s definition\nof politics in terms of state\u2019s unique sovereignty and ability\nto lead war (Schmitt 1932), and Hannah Arendt\u2019s account of the\nrole of nation states in integrating pluralities of individuals and\ncommunities into a single body politic, namely by\ntheir\u2014ever-vulnerable\u2014sovereignty to establish and enforce\nthe rule of law (e.g., in Arendt 1951).\n\nStein also discusses the ethical value and possible moral obligations\nof the state, as well as its role \u201cas a bearer of historical\nevents\u201d. For Stein, the state doesn\u2019t have any proper\nethical value; rather, values can only be attributed to their\nunderlying communities (1925: 111[152]). Accordingly, the state cannot\nbe an ethical subject (1925: 119[172]). The reason is that values and\nthe obligation to realize or facilitate them can only be\n\u201cacknowledged in acts of feeling\u201d (see also\n sect. 2.2);\n \u201cthe state is not capable of such acknowledgment\n(Kenntnisnahme), and in particular incapable of\nfeeling\u201d (ibid.). Ultimately, then, the state can act freely,\nand indeed remain a lawful or rightful state, without giving any\nconsideration to ethical norms. However, that doesn\u2019t exclude\nthat, via individual state representatives, the state remains\n\u201cin touch\u201d with the moral domain and is affected by\nethical demands.\n\nAgainst the German Idealist tradition, Stein argues that the ethical\nidea of the state does not lie in the historical development of\nindividual freedom (1925: 122[177]); freedom cannot\n\u201cdevelop\u201d but is either given or not, and can at best be\nonly secured by the state. Rather, the only ethical role of the state\nlies in the \u201cformation of a sensitivity\u201d for positive\nspiritual and ethical values and the facilitation of the freedom to\nrealize those values, or the \u201ccreation of culture\u201d (1925:\n124\u2013125[181]). This partly resonates with Arendt\u2019s famous\ndictum that \u201cfreedom is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre\nof politics\u201d (Arendt 1961: 146). Yet, and this is where Arendt\nand Stein would arguably part ways, the state has only a facilitating\nrole, even if the historically most powerful one, in \u201crealizing\nvalues\u201d\u2014which is the very \u201csense of history\u201d\n(1925: 126[184]). For Stein, there is nothing in the ontic nature of\nstate that could ethically demand this role.\n4.2 On the Nature and Education of Women\n\nStein\u2019s writings on the nature of woman (Stein 2000c) are\nconsistent with her overall anthropology. A committed feminist from\nher youth, she was aware of the \u201cgreat cultural upheaval\u201d\n(2000c: 133[152]) in which she, following the suffragettes in England\nand similar movements in Germany, was participating. She vigorously\ndefended the right of women to enter all professions and\nbranches of education without exception (2000c: 132[105]). She rejected\ndescriptions of women as \u201cthe weaker sex\u201d (2000c: 136[157])\nand defended their capacity to work in physically demanding jobs. But\nwomen also had special expertise and should also, for instance, be\ninvolved in framing laws that affected women or children. Stein\npersonally campaigned for women to be admitted to higher education,\nespecially for the Habilitation required for university teaching. As\nan educator of women at the Dominican boarding school in Speyer, she\nwrote on the nature, status, and calling of women. Most of her public\naddresses were given to the Catholic Women Teachers Association.\n\nStein criticized the one-sided development of women in contemporary\nsociety (2000c: 87[96]). The demand for equality has sometimes meant\nthat the unique nature of women is neglected or downplayed. Stein\ncriticized the early twentieth-century suffragettes, who, in their\ngoal to establish equality between men and women, were driven to deny\nthe distinctiveness of the feminine nature (2000c: 2[254]). Women have\nnatural vocations to be spouse and mother, but they also have\nother talents: scientific, technical, artistic, and so on. All must be\nnurtured. She recognized that women of her time had \u201cthe double\nburden of family duties and professional life\u201d (2000c: 26[54])\nwhich challenged the possibility of personal fulfillment.\n\nWomen are essentially different from men. For Stein, women\u2019s\nrelation of soul to body is different from man\u2019s; the\nwoman\u2019s soul is more intimately connected to the body (2000c:\n86[95]). Moreover, women have deeper and fuller emotional lives (2000c:\n87[96]); accordingly, women have a crucial political-social role as\nthe educators of humanity. Stein insists that all education must take\ncognizance of the specific nature of woman (2000c: 141[162]), their\nspecific spirituality. She claims, whereas men can be abstract, women\nare more interested in the concrete totality: \u201cabstraction\nin every sense is alien to the feminine nature\u201d (2000c:\n19[45]). Women, furthermore, are uniquely oriented to the\npersonal dimension\u2014something that can be a virtue or a\ndefect. Women have a unique sensitivity to moral values. Women also\nlive more intensely through their bodies (2000c: 86[95]). But there is a\ndanger of the body controlling the soul. Stein, following Aquinas,\nargues that the soul is the form of the body, and as men and women\nhave different bodies, so they must have different kinds of souls\n(2000c: 18[45]). It is not the case, as some maintain, that men and\nwomen differ in bodies only and that their minds are unaffected by\nthis difference (2000c: 162[183]). Men, for Stein, are focused on their\nown concerns, women are primarily focused empathetically on\nothers.\n\nStein discussed the meaning of \u201cprofession\u201d\n(Beruf) and \u201ccalling\u201d (Ruf), discussions\nwe also find in the later Husserl. For Stein, the essence of all\neducation is religious. Men and women are called, in the first\ninstance, by God. She defends the specifically religious profession\nfor women\u2014a \u201csupernatural\u201d vocation, requiring\ngrace. Entrusting the soul to God frees religious women of their\nburden; participation in the divine life is \u201cliberating\u201d.\nIndeed, she supported the idea that married women could practice their\nreligious vocation (2000c: 92[102]). In public talks, Stein even\ntackled the contentious topic of women priests (2000c:\n76\u201377[83]). The contemporary Church, Stein maintained, has need\nof \u201cfeminine energies\u201d (2000c: 77[83]), and there is no\ndogma preventing women\u2019s ordination (2000c: 77, 139[83, 160]).\n\n\nStein also endorses the traditional account of woman as serving and\nobedient to the spouse who protects her (2000c: 19[46]). Every soul is\nunique (Stein 2000c: 80[88]). Yet there are also different\n\u201ctypes\u201d (Arten) of \u201cwomen\u2019s\nsoul\u201d. While she acknowledges that the historical relationship\nbetween the sexes (since the biblical Fall) has been one of lordship\nand bondage (2000c: 67[72]), Stein defends the essential difference\nbetween men and women (attested, she believes, in the Genesis story of\nAdam and Eve). Male and Female are equal in that both made in the\nimage of God. For her the prototype for men was Jesus, for women it\nwas Mary (2000c: 176[198]). Yet, she was aware that \u201cmodern youth\nhas proclaimed its sexual rights\u201d (2000c: 130[149]) and believed\nit urgent for Catholics to have a broadminded approach to sexuality to\nanswer these demands (2000c: 131[150]). Therefore, sex education should\nbe provided in school for boys and girls alike (2000c: 131[150]).\n\nIn summary, Stein held firm views about women\u2019s and men\u2019s\nspecific natures. But woman\u2019s role is not limited to being\ncaretakers of the young and \u201chelpmate\u201d to man. Women have\ntheir own specific talents which may contribute to social and public\nlife in many different ways, based on their individuality. She also\nheld that women were by nature not just public actors but also had a\nspecific responsibility for children. Moreover, women were more in\ntune with their affective lives, and the highest expression of their\nessence was in self-giving love. Thus, she believed in the equal but\ncomplementary status of males and females.\n5. Spirituality and Theological Works\n\nStein\u2019s deep interest in spirituality was initiated by her\nreading of Theresa of Avila\u2019s Book of Her Life, but\ndeepened through her reading of Thomas Aquinas, St. John of the Cross,\nJohn Henry Newman, and Dionysius the Areopagite. Studying Aquinas\nconvinced her that it was possible to serve God and also do\nintellectual work, and she combined her spirituality with intellectual\nendeavors. She wrote several mystical studies, most notably\nScience of the Cross (Stein 2003). Science of the\nCross studies John of the Cross\u2019s mysticism, his search for\nspiritual oneness, and his devotion to love. Stein engages in a\npersonal meditation on the symbolism of the cross and of night (the\ndominant symbol in John of the Cross, Stein 2003: 31[38]). Night is\nsomething natural, invisible and formless, yet not nothing (2003:\n32[39]); it is like a foretaste of death (2003: 32[40]). For Stein,\n\u201cthe night denotes the profound darkness of faith\u201d\n(1950/2006: 35[27]). The mystical night comes not from without but\nfrom within (2003: 34[41]). Only by feeling the weight of the cross\ncan one learn the \u201cscience of the cross\u201d (scientia\ncrucis) which is \u201cburied in the soul like a seed\u201d\n(2003: 5[9\u201310]). The soul must be educated to know God and the\nspiritual side of human being must detach itself from the senses\n(2003: 95[115]). Surrendering to God in faith makes us pure spirits,\nfreed from all images and thus in darkness (2003: 97[118]).\n\u201cDark contemplation\u201d is the secret ladder to God.\n\nOne of Stein\u2019s posthumous publications was a scholarly essay,\n\u201cWays to Know God\u201d, (in Stein 1993) on the Christian\nmystic, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. For Stein, Dionysius\u2019\nmystical theology is not a scientific discipline but a way to speak\nabout God. Just as perception always points beyond itself, similarly\nour experience of the world points beyond itself to its divine source\n(1993: 27[99]). This world is the basis for natural theology. God is\nthe \u201cprimary theologian\u201d (Ur-Theologe; 1993:\n27[100]) and the whole of creation is his symbolic theology.\nAffirmative theology is based on the analogia entis; negative\ntheology is based on the dissimilarity between creatures and God. For\nStein, negative theology \u201cclimbs the scale of creatures\u201d\nto discover that at each level God is not found there: \u201cWe draw\nnear to God by denying what he is not\u201d (1993: 19[88]).\n\nBut Stein defends human freedom: \u201cthe soul has a right to make\ndecisions for itself\u201d (2003: 134[161]). She was aware that very\nfew people live in their inner depths and even less from out of their\ninner depths (2003: 132[159]). In her Ways to Stillness she\nwrote: \u201cEach of us is perpetually on the razor\u2019s edge: on\none side, absolute nothingness; on the other, the fullness of divine\nlife\u201d (1987: 12).\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe publication of the 27-volume Edith Stein Gesamtausgabe\nhas confirmed Stein as an independent, creative, and highly productive\nphilosopher, who made original contributions on such diverse topics as\npersonhood and the apprehension of others in empathy, collective\nintentionality and shared experiences, emotions and values, the nature\nof the state, the education of women and women\u2019s rights and the\nnature of being and essence. Stein was not only in critical discussion\nwith her contemporaries, including philosophers such as Pf\u00e4nder,\nScheler, Reinach, or Husserl, psychologists such as Lipps,\nM\u00fcnsterberg, or Stumpf, and sociologists such as T\u00f6nnies,\nLitt, or Simmel, but her work also harbors rich conceptual,\nmethodological and systematic resources that are of continued\nrelevance for a number of recent philosophical and interdisciplinary\ndebates. While in her earlier writings Stein pursued detailed\nphenomenological analyses, in her later work she engaged in\nmetaphysics, but also in philosophical and theological anthropology\nand mysticism. Integrating eidetic phenomenology and Thomistic\nmetaphysics, Stein ultimately developed a novel systematic account of\nsocial life that is the produce of the actions of free, individual\npersons, whose experiences and volitions are rooted in cognitions as\nwell as emotions and who can attain the level of rational and communal\nlife that is open to the possibility of a transcendence, lifting\nhumans beyond their finitude.\n",
