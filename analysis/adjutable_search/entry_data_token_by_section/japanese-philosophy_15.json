    "main_text": "Possible Contributions to Philosophy at Large || The Agency of No-I vs. Autonomous Self\n5.3 The Agency of No-I vs. Autonomous Self\n\nMost Western philosophies, as well as Abrahamic religious theologies,\nthink of personal identity as a discrete, independently existing,\nautonomous agency. That view in turn generates certain assumptions\nabout creative authorship, ethical responsibility, and religious faith\nin a transcendent reality. Such a view of personal identity is seldom\nfound in Japanese philosophy, however. Instead, the self is defined by\na field of interdependent relationships. Confucianism sees the\ndefining relations as a set of interpersonal roles, Buddhism as a\nbroader set of interdependent events or conditions. (Shint\u014d has\nmultiple theories, including sometimes an idea of an individual soul,\nbut even that is often considered holographically inscribed with a\ncollective soul.) If there is generally no independent \u201cI\u201d\nin Japanese philosophy, then how might we understand agency in such\nareas as artistic creativity, ethics, and religious faith?\n5.3.1 Artistic Agency\n\nAlthough there is an abundance of aesthetic theories in the Japanese\ntradition, artistic creativity is generally thought to originate not\nin the artist but in the artist\u2019s engagement within a field that\nincludes the medium, the auto-expressive character of reality, and the\naudience. All that together\u2014artist, medium, reality, and\naudience\u2014comprises kokoro in its fullest sense. The\ncreativity within art originates not in the individual\u2019s\nself-expression but in kokoro\u2019s auto-expression.\n(Kasulis 2008)\n\nHence, in creating the work of art, the rock gardener may speak of\n\u201clistening to the rocks,\u201d the ikebana master of\n\u201cworking with the flowers.\u201d In his theory of\npoetics, Motoori Norinaga stressed the importance of the audience as\npart of the field of kokoro, claiming that an unread poem is\nnot yet a poem. In the classical Western tradition, creativity was\nsometimes construed as the artist\u2019s being inspired by a muse, in\neffect a double agency. Yet, both agencies\u2014artist and\nmuse\u2014were discrete individuals. How would a philosophy of\nartistic creativity be different if it is one with no discrete\nindividuals, but instead a complex process of an auto-generative\nfield? That would seem to be a provocative question for comparative\naesthetics. (See entry on \n Japanese Aesthetics.)\n5.3.2 Ethics without Discrete Agents\n\nAs many Japanese theories of creativity recognize the agency arising\nwithin a field of engagement without the need for a discrete,\nindependently existing \u201cI,\u201d the same can be said for many\nethical theories. With their tenet of no-I, Japanese Buddhist\nphilosophers typically stress egoless responsiveness within a\nsituation rather than the individual\u2019s responsibility to follow\nrules, principles, or divine mandates. As mentioned in section 3.2.1\nabove, even the Chinese Confucian mandate of heaven (C.\ntianming; J. tenmei) never found a comfortable home\nin Japanese Confucianism. Yet, from a Western philosophical\nstandpoint, it may seem paradoxical to speak of an ethics without\neither principles or a sense of responsibility.\n\nOne way to open a dialogue with the West on this issue is to consider\nthe critique posed by the aforementioned medieval Pure Land\nphilosopher, Shinran, who argued against making rationality the basis\nfor ethics. Basically, he insisted that to try to rationally determine\nwhat is right is to distance oneself from the field of events, to make\nthe self an ego detached from the flow of reality by the very act of\ntrying to \u201cfigure it out\u201d (hakarai). Engagement\nwith the events as they occur, by contrast, enables a form of knowing\nthat allows a compassionate response, the true basis of ethics.\nDetachment from events not only feeds the ego (I know what is\nright) but also thwarts the internal relationships that make\ncompassion possible. So. Shinran argues, the attempt to know what is\nright and to apply rational principles undermines rather than enables\ntrue moral behavior. (See the entry on \n Japanese Pure Land Philosophy, section 4.4.)\n\nIn light of that analysis, on what grounds can we prefer an ethics of\nresponsibility over one of responsiveness or vice versa? The modern\nphilosopher Watsuji Tetsur\u014d claimed that ethics is the\nmanifestation of a philosophical anthropology (Watsuji 1996). That is,\nour ethical theories reflect our understanding of what it means to be\nhuman. Presumably, the same philosophical anthropology informing our\nethics would also underlie, for example, our theories of knowledge,\naesthetics, and politics. If that is correct, ethics cannot be a\nsubfield of philosophical inquiry separate from other subfields. For\nWatsuji, ethics is inseparable from the cultural milieu\n(f\u016bdo) from which we derive meaning as human beings in\nall aspects of our lives. As Watsuji put it, \u201cthe study of\nethics is the study of human being.\u201d (See the entry on \n Watsuji Tetsur\u014d, sections 2\u20133.) \nAgain Japanese philosophies often\nchallenge the sharp bifurcation between the prescriptive and\ndescriptive that has been assumed by much Western philosophy since\nDavid Hume.\n5.3.3 Faith without Self-Other\n\nThe Japanese notion of agency without an independent agent has\nramifications within religious philosophy as well, especially in\nrelation to faith. If there is no discrete self and no discrete\ntranscendent being, how can Shin Buddhism explain its central idea of\n\u201centrusting faith\u201d (shinjin)? Again, Shinran has\nthe most philosophically sophisticated explanation.\n\nFirst, it is crucial to underscore that entrusting faith is directed\nnot to Amida Buddha (as we might expect in a theistic religion) but\nrather to Amida\u2019s Vow to help bring to enlightenment those who\ncannot make it on their own. In fact, Amida Buddha as a person is only\na heuristic device allowing me a focal point for my entrusting faith\nso that I can surrender all senses of ego and self-agency to it. Once\nI do so, I as a discrete entity disappear into the field of as-ness,\nwhich is Amida in its true, impersonal form as infinite light. In\nother words as long as there is a subject having the entrusting faith,\nthat faith directs itself to depend on the power of the object (the\nVow of the personal Amida). But as the dependence on that objectified\nother-power becomes complete, the subject (the \u201cI\u201d who has\nthe entrusting faith) dissolves. Yet, if there is no subject, the\nobject must simultaneously disappear as well. The result is just the\nspontaneous naturalness of the agentless field, what Shinran calls the\n\u201cworking of nonworking\u201d (mugi no gi).\n\nShinran\u2019s account is certainly a powerful description for\nunderstanding \u201cfaith\u201d in a nontheistic religion. Yet, even\nsome theistic religions on the mystical end of the spectrum may speak\nof a God that disappears when engaged fully in a faith that overcomes\ndualism. The aforementioned Kyoto School includes thinkers like Ueda\nShizuteru and Nishitani Keiji who have pursued comparisons with\nMeister Eckhart on precisely those grounds (Ueda 2004).\n",
