    "main_text": "\nModern philosophy begins with Kant, and yet he marks the end of the\n\u201cModern\u201d epoch (1600\u20131800 AD/CE) in the history of\nphilosophy.[1]\nThe appearance of the Critique of Pure Reason in 1781 marks\nthe end of the modern period and the beginning of something entirely\nnew. Today his texts are read on all continents, and his thought has\nhad a profound impact on nearly all subsequent philosophical\ndiscussions. The 2004 bicentennial of his death, for instance, was\nreflected in conferences in Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany,\nHungary, Japan, Iran, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Paraguay, Poland,\nPortugal, Russia, Senegal, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and Turkey.\nLike other watershed figures, Kant has contributed to the shape of\nworld civilization, and the conceptualization we have of the world\ntoday. His practical ideas, such as the Categorical Imperative and its\nimplications (1785), informed the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights (1948), the Political and Economic Covenants (1966), and the\nInternational Criminal Court (2002). His exploration of natural\nsciences and his metaphysical ideas, particularly those of his\npre-critical period (1747\u20131770), are stunning. Kant gave the\nfirst account of the evolutionary reciprocity of spacetime and\nmomentum-energy, and formulated the first general law of free field\nradiation (1747). He suggested the conceptual solution of the three\nbody problem, which emerges in the interplay of Earth, Moon, and Sun\n(1754). He was the first to construct a detailed evolutionary\ncosmology (1755). His ideas on biospherical dynamics allowed him to\npredict the rhythms of the monsoon and the oscillation of coastal\nwinds (1755\u20131757). He suggested that the building blocks of\nmatter are energy bubbles (1756)\u2014an idea that is useful today in\nsuperstring theory in the guise of Calabi-Yau manifolds.\nA number of recent findings have helped to shed more light on\nKant\u2019s philosophical development.\nFirst, in terms of science, it now appears that his metaphysics has\nwithstood the test of time. While traditional scholars largely dismiss\nhis holistic ontology prior to the Critique, innovations in\nthe environmental and physical sciences have validated Kant\u2019s claims\nas realistic insights in the workings of nature. His evolutionary\ntheory of the universe is now seen as \u201cthe essence of modern\nmodels\u201d in cosmology (Coles 2001: 240), and his natural\nphilosophy is seen as the last milestone of western philosophy prior\nto its \u201ccomedown\u201d to skepticism (Hawking 2003, 166). In\nlight of climate change, it stands to reason that Kant\u2019s grasp on\nbiospherical dynamics and sustainable policies may well spur a\nphilosophical return to Kant in the near future.\nSecond, in terms of religion, important recent scholarship\nindicates an ambivalence, if not dislike of\nChristianity\u2014something that his early biographers, all of them\nLutheran theologians, took pains to avoid\nrevealing.[2]\nKant can be seen as defending pantheism, naturalism, evolution,\ncosmic expansion theory and holism, even when doing so was\nincompatible with an academic career.\nIn the 18th Century university system defending such\nviews often led to dismissal and/or lack of promotion. Kant, himself,\nwas always cautious when writing on such topics. In the context of\ncensorship, writers tend to become circumspect. To avoid trouble, they\nmay publish something anonymously; or they may make oblique remarks\ninstead of direct statements; or they may have second thoughts and\nretract earlier statements. Kant did all three things. But, for later\nreaders in increasingly secular ages, it is easy to miss Kant\u2019s\nsubtleties and implications.\nThird, in terms of culture, Kant\u2019s early views may be placed in a\nglobal rather than a purely Western context. Recent research suggests\nthat key ideas of Kant\u2019s natural philosophy also have sources in\nTaoist, Buddhist, Hindu and Confucian thought, which were\ndisseminated in continental Europe by Jesuits based in China,\npopularized by Leibniz and Wolff, and further developed by Wolff\u2019s\nSinophile student \nBilfinger.[3]\n One example is the idea of dialectics that\nBilfinger found in the Chinese classics, and which Kant encountered\nin the proceedings of the Russian academy.  Importation and serious\nconsideration of eastern thought was in its infancy during the end of\nthe modern period, and Kant was unaware of the Far Eastern roots of\nthe notions that influenced him. The historical irony is that he\ndismissed nonwestern cultures while being deeply influenced by their\ninsights.\nScholars split Kant\u2019s development into stages: \n\nthe pre-critical period (1745\u20131770), during which Kant works\nwithin the tradition of Leibniz/Wolff and writes his impressive early\nworks on natural phenomena; \n\u201csilent decade\u201d (1770\u20131781), during which Kant\nrefrained from publishing texts other than advertisements and\nendorsements for classes;\n the critical period (1781\u20131791), which marks the time of\ninsights or \u201cthe astonishing decade\u201d (Beck 1969: 433) of\nhis critical philosophy; and \nthe post-critical period (1798\u20131802), often cited as works\nof old age.[4] \n\n Recent studies indicate that Kant\u2019s philosophical development was\nfar more unified (Sch\u00f6nfeld 2000), and, in terms of its stages,\ninvolved deeper continuities (Edwards 2000) than previously\nrecognized. From the start, Kant was pushing quite a unique\nagenda. Recent scholarship contends Kant\u2019s earliest works are not\nonly commensurate and continuous with his late claims, but also offer\ninsight into some oddities of the critical period, such as the Third\nAnalogy of the \nCritique.[5]\n The new picture of Kant\u2019s development\nindicates that his intellectual trajectory was not as fractured and\nerratic as scholarship used to assume, and it also indicates that\nKant was not a late bloomer, but, rather, that he was innovative from\nthe start.\nThe following account covers Kant\u2019s development from his upbringing\nto the critical period. Its theme is his intellectual formation: the\ninfluences in his youth and education; his views on natural\nphilosophy, ontology and cosmology shaped during his early adulthood;\nthe questions subsequently pursued; and the historical fate of his\nanswers.[6]\n",
