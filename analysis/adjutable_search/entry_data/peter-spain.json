    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works: Some Comments on the Historiography\n\nPeter of Spain has been established as the medieval author of a work\nthat became widely known as Summule logicales magistri Petri\nHispani (Collection of Logic Matters of Master Peter of Spain).\nThe great number of manuscripts and printed editions is evidence of\nthe enormous success this work met with throughout European\nuniversities well into the seventeenth century. An interpolated\nversion of his Tractatus, by then known as the Summulae\nlogicales, was used by John Buridan as a basic text to comment\nupon. But finding out the true identity of the author of this\ninfluential Tractatus has proved to be a difficult task. For\na long time it was assumed that he was a Portuguese who became Pope in\n1276, under the name of John XXI. There is also another, earlier\ntradition, according to which the author of the Tractatus was\nregarded as Spanish, and a member of the Dominican order. Yet another\nattribution, dating from the fifteenth century, was to a Petrus\nFerrandi Hispanus, who died between 1254 and 1259; this attribution\nwould be consistent with the idea that Peter\u2019s works on logic\noriginated from the first half of the thirteenth century. According to\nstill another attribution, the Summule was compiled by a\nBlack Friar no earlier than in the late thirteenth or early fourteenth\ncentury.\n\nThe \u2018Dominican-thesis\u2019 can be divided into three\ntraditions:\n\nThe general view that Peter of Spain, author of the\nTractatus, is someone who belonged to Order of Black\nFriars,\nThe more specific view that the author of the Tractatus\nwas a frater Petrus Alfonsi Hispanus O.P.,\nAnother specific view that the Peter of Spain who created the\nTractatus was the same Peter of Spain as the one who wrote\nthe Legenda sancti Dominici and the Office of the\nSaint\u2019s Feast, namely Petrus Ferrandi Hispanus O.P., who died in\nthe 1250s.\n\n\nCurrent research on the identity of Peter of Spain has once again\ntaken up the idea that he must have been a member of the Dominican\nOrder instead of Pope John XXI (D\u2019Ors 1997, 2001, 2003).\nHowever, we are still in the dark about the true identity of Peter of\nSpain. The most recent information we have on this score is that a\nnumber of the Dominican candidates recently suggested as the author of\nthe Tractatus can be deleted from the list (Tugwell 1999,\n2006). The lack of further information also makes it difficult to\nestablish the dates and specifics of his carreer.\n\nIt is still not possible to establish the date of origin of the\nTractatus, the work that has enjoyed such enormous success.\nRecent scholarship suggests that it could have been written any time\nbetween the 1220s and the 1250s (Ebbessen 2013, 68\u201369). It has\nuniversally been recognised as a work by Peter of Spain. Another work\nthat has been identified as Peter of Spain\u2019s is a\nSyncategoreumata (Treatise on Syncategorematic Words), which\nwas probably written some years after the Tractatus.\nConsidering the fact that in all the thirteenth-century manuscripts\nthe Syncategoreumata directly follows the Tractatus,\nand given the number of similarities between doctrinal aspects of\nthese two works on logic, it is almost certain that they were written\nby the same author. Both works seem to have originated from Southern\nFrance or Northern Spain, the region where we also find the earliest\ncommentaries on these treatises.\n\nAn extensive list of writings ascribed to an author by the name of\nPetrus Hispanus is provided by Meirinhos (2018). Besides the two works\non logic, the Petrus Hispanus in the papa-tradition is the\nsupposed author of a famous medical work Thesaurus pauperum,\nas well as fourteen other works on medicine. Writings by (a) Peter of\nSpain in the field of natural philosophy include a Scientia libri\nde anima, and commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima, De morte et vita, De sensu et sensato,\nDe animalibus, and theological works include commentaries on\nworks by pseudo-Denys the Areopagite as well as a collection of\nsermons. As yet there is no certainty about whether the author of\nthese treatises also wrote the Tractatus and the\nSyncategoreumata, or about the dates of their origin.\n\nAnother Petrus Hispanus, referred to as Petrus Hispanus\nnon-papa, has been identified as the author of the Summa\n\u2018Absoluta cuiuslibet\u2019, a late twelfth-century\nhandbook on syntax closely linked with Priscian\u2019s\nInstitutiones grammatice, libb. XVII and XVIII, which became\nvery popular later in the Middle Ages under the name Priscianus\nminor (Kneepkens 1987). The chronology of this work seems to rule\nout that this Peter of Spain is the same author as the author of the\nTractatus.\n2. Origins of Peter\u2019s Works on Logic\n\nPeter\u2019s logic seems to have its origin in the continental\ntradition. Evidence of the educational carreer of the\nTractatus appears from two commentaries (see De Rijk 1968,\npp. 23\u201334 and De Rijk (ed.) 1972, Introduction, pp. LXXff.),\nwhich contain short lemmata and a number of questions\n(questiones) together with their solutions. The tracts as\ncontained in these texts are very similar to the ones in the\nTractatus. The Tractatus has features that are\ntypical of the Paris tradition, such as the separate treatment of\nampliation, restriction and distribution, as well as several other\ndoctrinal elements (see De Rijk (ed.) 1972, pp.\nLXXXIV\u2013LXXXVIII). We do not know whether Peter had any\nconnection with Paris, nor can we say anything definitive about the\nidentity of his teachers. Earlier sources for Peter\u2019s works on\nlogic can be traced back to Boethian-Aristotelian logic, and\nauthorities in the field of grammar such as Priscian and Donatus.\n\nLike the Tractatus, the Syncategoreumata also\ndisplays a continental origin. It appears to have continued along the\nlines of a similar work by Johannes Pagus. This work, which has been\ndated between 1225 and 1235, was later on further developed by\nNicholas of Paris, who wrote his Syncategoreumata between\n1240 and 1250 (see Braakhuis 1979, Vol. I, p. 248).\n3. The Tractatus\n\nThe Tractatus can be divided into two main parts. One part\ndeals with doctrines found in the so-called logica\nantiquorum\u2014i.e., the logica vetus (old logic) and\nlogica nova (new logic)\u2014and the other contains\ndoctrines covered by the logica modernorum\u2014viz. the\ntracts that discuss the proprietates terminorum (properties\nof terms).\n\nThe first main part of the Tractatus divides into five\ntracts. The first tract, De introductionibus (On introductory\ntopics), explains the concepts used in traditional\nlogic\u2014nomen (noun), verbum (verb),\noratio (phrase), propositio (proposition)\u2014and\npresents the divisions of and the (logical) relationships between\npropositions. The second tract, De predicabilibus (On the\npredicables), covers matters dealt with in Boethius\u2019s accounts\nof Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge. It gives an account of the\nconcept predicabile and the five\npredicables\u2014genus, species,\ndifferentia, proprium, accidens\u2014i.e.,\nthe common features of and differences between the predicables, as\nwell as of the terms \u2018predicatio\u2019 and\n\u2018denominativum\u2019. Tract three, De\npredicamentis (On the categories), discusses the ten Aristotelian\ncategories, as well as some items already dealt with in the previous\ntreatise. The fourth tract, De sillogismis (On syllogisms),\nmainly goes back to Boethius\u2019s De syllogismis\ncategoricis (On categorical syllogisms). It gives an explanation\nof the basic element of the syllogism, i.e., propositio, and\nof the syllogism, and then goes into mood and figure, the proper forms\nof syllogisms, and briefly deals with what are called paralogisms. The\nfifth tract, De locis (On topical relationships), is derived\nfrom Boethius\u2019s De topicis differentiis (On different\ntopical relationships) I and II. This tract starts off with an\nexplanation of the notions argumentum and\nargumentatio, and then proceeds to deal with the species of\nargumentation: syllogism, induction, enthymeme, and example. Next, it\ngives a definition of locus (the Latin translation of the\nGreek topos): a locus is the seat of an argument\n(i.e., the locus is supposed to warrant the inference by\nbringing it under some generic rule.) The intrinsic loci (=\nthe kinds of locus that occurs when the argument is derived\nfrom the substance of the thing involved) are covered first, followed\nby the extrinsic loci (= the kinds of locus that\noccur when the argument is derived from something that is completely\nseparate from the substance of the thing involved) and intermediary\nloci (= the kinds of locus that occur when the\nargument is taken from the things that partly share in the terms of\nthe problem and partly differ from it). Examples are:\nintrinsic\u2014the locus \u201cfrom definition\u201d:\n\u2018a rational animal is running; therefore a man is\nrunning\u2019; extrinsic\u2014the locus \u201cfrom\nopposites\u201d: \u2018Socrates is black; therefore he is not\nwhite\u2019; intermediary\u2014\u2018the just is good; therefore\njustice is good\u2019.\n\nThe second part of the Tractatus comprises subjects that were\nof major importance in the doctrine of the properties of terms. In the\nsixth tract, De suppositionibus, the theory of supposition is\ndealt with. The treatise begins with an exposition of\nsignificatio. The definition of significatio runs:\nsignificatio is the respresentation of a thing by means of a\nword in accordance with convention. Next it gives a definition of the\nrelated terms suppositio and copulatio, and the\ndifferences between the terms significatio,\nsuppositio and copulatio. Of these three\nsuppositio and significatio are the most important\nin Peter\u2019s semantics. Suppositio is defined as the\nacceptance of a substantive verb for some thing. Suppositio\nis dependent on significatio, because supposition can only\noccur via a term that already has some significatio. Put in\nother words, significatio pertains to a word by itself, and\nsupposition to a term as actually used in some context.\n\nThe tract concludes with a division of suppositio. The first\ndivision is into suppositio communis (common supposition) and\nsuppositio discreta (discrete supposition)\u2014e.g., the\nterms homo (man) and Sortes (Socrates)\nrespectively.\n\nThe second division, suppositio communis, is divided into\nnaturalis (natural) and accidentalis (coincidental).\nSuppositio naturalis is described as the acceptance of a\ncommon term for all those things that can share in the common\nuniversal nature signified by the term in question\u2014e.g.,\nhomo (\u2018man\u2019) taken by itself by its very nature\nis able to stand for all men, whether in the past, present or future;\nsuppositio accidentalis is the acceptance of a common term\nfor those things for which the term in question requires an additional\nterm\u2014e.g., in homo est (\u2018A man is\u2019) the\nterm homo stands for present men, whereas in homo\nfuit (\u2018A man has been\u2019) and in homo erit\n(\u2018A man will be\u2019) it stands for past men and future men\nrespectively, owing to the additional terms fuit and\nerit.\n\nThe third division, suppositio accidentalis, is divided into\nsuppositio simplex (simple supposition) and suppositio\npersonalis (personal supposition). Suppositio simplex is\nthe acceptance of a term for the universal \u2018thing\u2019 it\nsignifies, as in homo est species (\u2018Man is a\nspecies\u2019, animal est genus (\u2018Animal is a\ngenus\u2019), in which the substantive terms homo and\nanimal stand for the universal man and animal, and not for\nany one of their particulars. Suppositio simplex can occur\nboth in the subject- and in the predicate-term\u2014e.g., homo\nest species (\u2018Man is a species\u2019) and omnis homo\nest animal (\u2018Every man is an animal\u2019) respectively.\nSuppositio personalis is the acceptance of a common term for\none or more of its particulars, as in homo currit (\u2018A\nman is running\u2019).\n\nThe fourth division, suppositio personalis, is subdivided\ninto either derterminata (determinate = standing for a\ncertain particular) or confusa (confused = standing for any\nindividual falling under that name). Suppositio determinata\noccurs when a common term is taken indefinitely or in combination with\na particular sign\u2014e.g., homo currit (\u2018Man is\nrunning\u2019) or aliquis homo currit (\u2018A/some man is\nrunning\u2019). Suppositio confusa occurs when a common term\nis taken in combination with a universal sign (\u2019Every man is\nrunning\u2019).\n\nThe tract on supposition winds up with the discussion of a few\nquestions regarding the attribution of supposition in a few cases.\n\nThe seventh tract of the Tractatus, on fallacies, which forms\npart of the Aristotelian-Boethian logic, is written in the tradition\nof the Fallacie maiores (Major fallacies). The eighth tract,\nDe relativis (On relatives), deals with the relative pronouns\nas defined by Priscian in his Institutiones grammaticae. The\nrelative pronouns are devided into: relatives of substance, such as\nqui (who), ille (he), alius (another), and\nrelatives of accident, such as talis (of such a kind),\nqualis (of what kind), tantus (so much),\nquantus (how much). The former are subdivided into relatives\nof identity (qui and ille) and relatives of\ndiversity (such as alter and reliquus, both of which\ncan be translated as \u2018the other\u2019). The relative of\nidentity is defined in terms of supposition as what refers to and\nstands for the same thing. These relatives are either reciprocal or\nnon-reciprocal. With regard to the relatives of identity, Peter adds a\ndicussion of a number of questions about the rationale for using\ndemonstrative pronouns, and some problems concerning how the fallacy\nof a relative having two diverse referents comes about.\n\nThe tract on relatives continues with a brief discussion on the\nrelatives of diversity, accompanied by a rule about the supposition of\nthe relative when it is added to a superior and an inferior in a\npremiss and a conclusion, as in aliud ab animali; ergo\naliud ab homine (\u2018Something other than an animal; therefore\nsomething other than a man\u2019). With regard to relatives of\nidentity a rule of the \u201cancients\u201d, who deny that a\nproposition introduced by a relative can have a contradictory\nopposite, is discussed and rejected. Another rule is given about the\nidentity of supposition of a non-reciprocal relative and what it\nrefers to. The tract concludes with short accounts of relatives of\naccident.\n\nThe ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth tracts of the\nTractatus, i.e., the short tracts De ampliationibus\n(On ampliation), De appellationibus (On appellation), De\nrestrictionibus (On restriction) and De distributionibus\n(On distribution), are in fact elaborations of the theory of\nsupposition. Ampliation is an extension of the supposition of a term.\nIt occurs when an expression is combined with a modal term\u2014e.g.\nhomo potest esse Antichristus (\u2018A man can be the\nAntichrist\u2019), and homo necessario est animal (\u2018A\nman is necessarily an animal\u2019)\u2014in which case the\nsupposition of the term \u2018man\u2019 is extended to more than\njust individuals existing in the present. The tract on\nappellationes is very short: appellation is considered no\nmore than a special case of restriction, i.e., the restricted\nsupposition brought about by a present-tense verb. In this tract the\nrules of appellation are in fact specific kinds of rules of\nrestriction. The subject of restriction in general is discussed in the\neleventh tract. The rules of restriction are the same ones as were\npresented in the early Parisian textbooks on logic (see de Libera\n1982, pp. 176\u2013177). The final tract, on distribution, deals with\nthe multiplication of common terms as a result of their being combined\nwith universal signs. These universal signs are either distributive of\nsubstance (such as omnis, nullus), or of accidents\n(such as qualiscumque, quantuscumque). In this\ndescription \u2018substance\u2019 is defined as substistent modes of\nbeing, and \u2018accident\u2019 as accidental modes of being.\nSeparate attention is given to the universal sign omnis\n(\u2018all\u2019 or \u2018every\u2019) along with a discussion of\nthe common rule that the use of omnis requires three\nappellata (particular things). The most frequently cited\nexample in these discussions in the thirteenth century was the\nsophisma omnis phenix est (\u2018Every phoenix is\u2019).\nAccording to Peter of Spain, the use of omnis does not call\nfor at least three appellata; an exception to this rule is\nfound in cases in which there is only one appellatum, as is\nthe phoenix-case. The tract also pays attention to a number of\ntongue-twisting sophisma-sentences.\n4. The Syncategoreumata\n\nPeter\u2019s treatise on syncategorematic words forms part of a\nseparate genre that developed from the beginning of the thirteenth\ncentury. The term syncategorema comes from a famous passage\nin Priscian\u2019s Institutiones grammatice II, 15, which\nintroduces two types of wordclasses (partes orationis)\ndistinguished by logicians, viz. nouns and verbs on the one hand, and\nsyncategoremata, or consignificantia, on the other.\nThe latter are defined as words that do not have a definitive meaning\non their own, but acquire one only in combination with other,\ncategorematic words.\n\nLike the treatises of the Tractatus kind, the\nSyncategoreumata were developed from the (twelfth-century)\ntheories on fallacies, as well as from grammatical doctrines (from the\nsame period). From the second half of the twelfth century, there was a\ngrowing interest in the linguistic elements that are considered to lie\nat the basis of ambiguity and fallacious reasoning. Hence the increase\nof treatises presenting a systematic account of these terms. The\nconnection between these treatises and Priscian\u2019s grammar can be\ngathered from the attention different authors pay to the signa\nquantitatis (or quantifiers) and their interest in the meaning\nand function of syncategorematic terms.\n\nThe list of words to be included among the syncategoreumata\nwas not always the same. Generally speaking it comprised exclusive\nwords tantum (only), solus (alone), exceptive words\nsuch as preter (except), nisi (unless), consecutive\nwords such as si (if) and nisi (if not), the words\nincipit (begins) and desinit (ceases), the modal\nterms necessario (necessarily) and contingenter\n(contingently), the conjunctives an (or), et (and),\nnisi (unless), in eo quod (in that), and\nquin (that not). In Peter\u2019s work we also find a\ndiscussion of the terms quanto (\u2018how much\u2019 or\n\u2018as much as\u2019) quam (\u2018than\u2019 or\n\u2018as\u2019) and quicquid (whatever). Unlike that of\nsome other authors (such as William of Sherwood and Robert Bacon), his\nlist does not include the word omnis.\n\nIn the opening of his Syncategoreumata, Peter presents his\nrationale for this investigation, viz. that there is a close link\nbetween the use of these kinds of words in sentences and their\ntruth-value. His idea is that the syncategoreumata must have\nsome sort of signification, but not the same as the categorematic\nwords. For this special kind of signification he uses the words\nconsignificatio and dispositio.\n\nThe first two separate chapters of the Syncategoreumata are\ndevoted to the words est and non respectively, which\nare said to be implied in all other syncategorematic words.\nPeter\u2019s account of the first word focuses on the notion of\ncompositio (composition), which is explained in great detail,\nby looking into the signification of nouns and verbs (signifying a\ncomposition of a quality with a substance, and that of an act with a\nsubstance respectively). Considerable attention is given to the\ncomposition featuring in the verb \u2018is\u2019, in the form of the\nquestion of whether the composition involved can be counted among\nbeings or not, considering the fact that it can be used to express\ndifferent kinds of states of affairs. The chapter on negation\nintroduces the important distinction between an act as conceived of or\nin the manner of a concept (ut concepta sive per modum\nconceptus) and an act as carried out (ut exercita) (see\nNuchelmans 1988). Among the former type we acts as expressed by the\nnoun \u2018negation\u2019 and the verb \u2018to deny, whereas an\nact of the latter type is what is expressed by the negative particle\n\u2018not\u2019. The remainder of this chapter deals with the\nfunction of the negation, which is to remove the composition found in\nwhatever it covers, and discusses some well-known sophisma-sentences\nwhich turn on the specific function of negation.\n\nThe third chapter of the Syncategoreumata discusses the\nexclusive words solus and tantum. They are called\nexclusives because they carry out an exclusion, not because they\nsignify one. An exclusion, furthermore, requires four things, namely,\nwhat is excluded, what is excluded from, the respect in which it is\nexcluded, and the act of exclusion. The kinds of exclusion are divided\ninto general and specific: the former involves an exclusion from\nsomething generic, whereas the latter from something specific.\nQuestions that come up in this section have to do with the results of\nadding an exclusive term to different kinds of words, such as to a\nterm falling under the category of Substance: does it exclude only\nother substances, or does it also exclude from things listed under\nanother category? And what if it is added to a term listed under the\ncategory of Accident (such as colour, quantity, and so on)? The next\nquestion deals with the sorts of terms that can be meaningfully\nassociated with an exclusion. For example, is it possible to exclude\nsomething from \u2018being\u2019 (as in \u2018Only being is,\ntherefore nothing other than being is\u2019)? The tract proceeds with\nthe kinds of things that can qualify for an exclusion. The fourth\nchapter, which deals with exceptive words, is compiled in a similar\nmanner.\n\nThe fifth chapter is about the word si, which is said to\nsignify causality in or via antecedence. The chapter also discusses\nthe kinds of consecution or consequence, problems of inference\nconnected with the referents of terms used in consecutive sentences,\nand how to contradict a conditional sentence. Special attention is\ngiven to the problem whether from an impossible antecedent anything\nfollows.\n\nThe chapter on \u2018begins\u2019 and \u2018ceases\u2019 is a good\nexample of the way in which extra-logical considerations found their\nway into medieval treatises on logic. Thus, apart from the semantics\nand inferential problems connected with the use of these words in\npropositions, the chapter also looks into the notions of motion and\ntime. An important part of Peter\u2019s ontological views can be\ngathered from chapter seven, which covers issues connected with the\nuse of modal terms. Chapter eight discusses the signification and use\nof connectives, and the final chapter on syncategorematic words proper\nis concerned with the expressions quanto, quam and\nquicquid. A very short, concluding chapter of Peter\u2019s\nSyncategoreumata deals with a somewhat isolated topic, i.e.,\nthe proper modes of response in an argument. The topics looked into\nare solution, the quantity and quality of syllogisms, and the ways to\ngo about proving a syllogism.\n5. Doctrinal Elements in Peter\u2019s Logic\n\nOne of the most important elements in Peter\u2019s logic concerns the\ndoctrine of supposition. The theory of supposition has its origins in\nthe twelfth century, when the medievals showed a growing interest in\nthe ways in which words function in different contexts. This way of\ndealing with the semantics of terms has been dubbed the\n\u201ccontextual approach\u201d (see de Rijk 1962\u201367, Vol. II,\nPart I, pp. 113\u2013117).\n\nThe primary semantic property of a word is its significatio,\nin Peter\u2019s definition, the \u201crepresentation of a thing by a\nword in accordance with convention\u201d. It is a natural property of\na word, the presentation of some (universal) content to the mind. The\nsignificatio of a word depends on its imposition, i.e., the\napplication originally given to the word in question. A word can have\nmore than one significatio, if it was originally applied to\ntwo or more distinct (universal) natures.\n\nThe counterpart of significatio, the formal constituent of\nevery meaning, is the word\u2019s capacity to \u201cstand for\u201d\ndifferent things (even though its significatio remains the\nsame), depending on the context in which it is used. In the early\nstages of the development of the theory on the properties of terms,\nthis feature of a word was called appellatio. For instance,\nthe words \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018horse\u2019 can be used to\nstand for different individual men or horses. But they can also stand\nfor themselves, e.g., when they are used in sentences such as\n\u2018man is a noun\u2019, or \u2018horse is a noun\u2019.\nMoreover, their meaning can differ according as the words are used in\ncombination with verbs of different tenses.\n\nIn the final stages of the development of the theory, the notion of\nsupposition becomes the general label that covers all the uses of a\nnoun (substantive or adjectival), to which other recognised properties\nof terms (appellatio, ampliatio and\nrestrictio) are subordinated.\n\nThe theory of properties of terms shows a radical inconsistency, which\nhas been explained as \u201cthe persistent hesitation of medieval\nlogicians between the domains of connotation (universals) and\ndenotation (individuals)\u201d (De Rijk 1982, pp. 167\u2013168).\nThis inconsistency runs throughout Peter\u2019s account of\nsupposition, and comes to the fore most prominently in what he says\nabout natural supposition (suppositio naturalis). The main\nproblem is in what way the property of natural supposition is related\nto a term\u2019s significatio, which was defined as the\nacceptance of a word for a thing (res). By this definition,\nthe significatio of the term \u2018man\u2019 covers both\nits intension and extension, i.e., the universal nature of man and the\nindividuals that have this nature in common. Suppositio\nnaturalis, on the other hand, is described as \u201cthe\nacceptance of a common term for all those things that can share in a\ncommon universal nature\u201d; for example, the term\n\u2018man\u2019 taken by itself by its very nature stands for all\nthe individuals that fall under it, whether they existed in the past,\nexist in the present or will exist in the future. From this definition\nand the example just presented it appears that the extensional\nfeatures of significatio and suppositio naturalis\noverlap. The latter kind of suppositio has been explained by\ninterpreters as the natural capacity of a significative word to stand\nfor something.\n\nThere is a more telling difference between significatio and\nsuppositio naturalis, however. Significatio is the\nnatural property of any significative term to represent things, owing\nto its original imposition, whereas a term\u2019s supposition only\nenters the scene when it is used. The expression \u201ctaken by\nitself\u201d (per se sumptus) found in Peter\u2019s account\nof suppositio naturalis, does not mean that no context is\nrequired, as is the case in significatio, but it merely\nindicates that for the moment the actual context is being disregarded.\nThe link between significatio and suppositio is the\nfollowing. When some word has acquired a signification by an\nimpositor (= someone who bestows a meaning upon a word), then\nit connotes a univeral nature or essence, and acquires a natural\ncapacity to stand for all the actual and possible individuals that\nshare in this common nature; it owes this capacity to its\nsignificatio. If, however, we disregard for a moment the\nactual context in which the term in question is used and look upon the\nterm as taken by itself (per se sumptus), then its\nsupposition covers its entire extension. If we take the factual\ncontext in which the term is used into consideration, then its\nextension becomes limited, owing to the context. The context, or more\nprecisely, the added significative term, can be of three kinds: the\nadded significative term can be a predicate of a proposition in which\nthe term at issue occurs, the added significative term can be an\nadjective, or the context can be of a social nature (see de Rijk 1971\nand de Rijk 1985, pp. 183\u2013203).\n\nThe distinction between significatio and suppositio\nnaturalis persisted throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth\ncenturies. Behind it is the fundamental view that regardless of\nwhether a word is used in some context or not, it always has a\nsignificatum, i.e., the universal nature or essence it\nsignifies, which can be separated from what the word comes to mean in\na specific context.\n\nBesides suppositio naturalis, Peter\u2019s (and other\nmedievals\u2019) conception of suppositio simplex also seems\nto hover between connotation and denotation. In the expression\nhomo est species the term homo has suppositio\nsimplex, but this is precisely too what the term homo\nsignifies. So there scarcely seems reason to separate signification\nfrom supposition on this score. The specific use of suppositio\nsimplex found in Peter of Spain and other medieval authors, as\nthe representation of a universal nature, is rejected later on by\nauthors such as William of Ockham. For the latter, the term\nhomo in the example just given has suppositio\nsimplex (for Ockham a special case of suppositio\nmaterialis) in that it stands for the mental concept of man\n(Kneale & Kneale 1978, pp. 268\u2013269).\n\nPeter of Spain\u2019s logical works are commonly characterised as\nrevealing a moderately \u2018realistic\u2019 outlook. To explain the\ncontents of linguistic expressions and the function of logical terms,\nhe is inclined to focus on their relationships to some extra-mental\nreality. This can be shown from the way in which he discusses the use\nof the word est (is), his account of suppositio\nsimplex, and the way he analyses the occurrence of the word\n\u2018necessarily\u2019 in propositions. Moreover, his conception of\nthe consecutive expression \u2018if\u2019 clearly shows his tendency\nto put the domains of reality and language on a par. (However, not all\nlinguistic expressions are connected with extramental reality.\nAlthough ontology always plays a role in his accounts of language, it\nwould appear that Peter is especially interested in the contents of\nlinguistic epressions. In that regard it seems more appropriate to\nspeak of an intensionalist semantics.)\n\nIn his Syncategoreumata, Peter analyses the significative\nfunction of the word \u2018is\u2019. To a certain extent his\nfindings are not confined to that term alone, but cover all verbs, in\nwhich the verb \u2018is\u2019 is always understood. The most\nremarkable feature about his discussion of \u2018is\u2019 is his\nfocus on the notion of composition. What he is particularly interested\nin is the kinds of things affirmative propositions featuring that verb\ncan refer to, in his words, the type of composition involved in such\npropositions.\n\nThe notion of \u2018composition\u2019 plays a prominent role in\nPeter\u2019s semantics. Before embarking on the specifics of the word\n\u2018is\u2019, he first looks into the compositiones\ninvolved in the noun and the verb. When it comes to the composition\ninvolved in the use of \u2018is\u2019, the starting-point for his\naccount is the question whether the expression \u2018is\u2019 in a\nproposition of the form \u2018S is P\u2019 implies the\n\u2018being\u2019 of the composition. Whether it does or not depends\non how we consider the composition. If we are talking about any\ncomposition whatsoever, in his words, the composition in general, the\ncomposition can indiscriminately be connected with beings and\nnon-beings. This is because we can talk about both things that are and\nthings that are not by making use of the same affirmative\npropositions. Hence anything expressed by a proposition of the form\n\u2018S is P\u2019 is a being in a certain sense (ens\nquodammodo). The type of composition he is referring to here is\nthe mental content of some affirmation, which is something that only\nhas being to a certain degree. However, the composition in general,\nthat is, the state of affairs involved in such expressions, is\nprimarily connected with being rather than non-being. It is when we\ntalk about non-beings, such as chimaeras, that being in a certain\nsense once again enters the scene. Hence a distinction of the types of\nbeing referred to, or the types of composition involved in affirmative\npropositions into being in the absolute sense (ens\nsimpliciter) and being in a certain sense (ens\nquodammodo). The difference between these two types of being is\nillustrated by the distinction between two types of inference: from\n\u2018A man is an animal\u2019, in which the composition involved is\na being in the absolute sense, it follows \u2018Therefore a man\nis\u2019, but from \u2018A chimaera is a non-being\u2019, in which\nthe composition is a being in a certain sense only, it does not follow\n\u2018Therefore a chimaera is\u2019.\n\nThe counterpart of Peter\u2019s discussion of composition is the\nsection on negation. Peter specifically goes into the question of what\nit is the negation denies. In his words, the negation removes the\ncomposition. The composition in this connection is identified with the\naffirmed state of affairs (res affirmata). What the negation\nremoves is not the state of affairs, but the affirmation that goes\nalong with it. The basis of both composition and negation turns out to\nbe the same state of affairs, i.e., something that is formulated in\nthe mind, to which we can assent or which we can deny to be the\ncase.\n\nThe focus on matters of ontology is evidenced in other portions of\nPeter\u2019s logic as well. For Peter, as for Henry of Ghent (who\nalso wrote a Syncategoreumata) the expression homo\n(man) in homo est animal (\u2018Man is an animal\u2019) has\nsimple supposition: it stands for the universal nature of humanity.\nAccordingly, the expression is necessarily true, even if no man should\nexist. The term \u2018necessarily\u2019 thus has ampliative force:\nit enables the subject term \u2018man\u2019 to refer to individuals\nnot only existing in the present ( which is the normal case when a\npresent-tense verb is used), but also to those of the past and the\nfuture. This analysis runs contrary to what is found in some other\nSyncategoreumata authors, like Johannes Pagus and Nicholas of\nParis, who maintain that the term \u2018necessarily\u2019 does not\nhave ampliative force. Hence the expression homo necessario est\nanimal (\u2018A man is necessarily an animal\u2019) is only\ntrue on the condition that a man exists.\n\nA similar point is made in connection with the use of modal terms. For\nPeter of Spain, logical necessity is based upon ontological necessity,\nor, the necessity of propositions has its foundation in the necessity\nof the things spoken about. Necessity is associated with different\ntypes of things, such as the relationships between certain concepts\n(such as genera and species), and the specific things the notions of\nwhich we come across in the different kinds of (scientific) knowledge\n(such as mathematical entities and their properties). His outlook on\nnecessity is clearly revealed in his analysis of the inference\nhomo necessario est animal; ergo Sortes necessario est\nanimal (\u2018A man is necessarily an animal; therefore Socrates\nis necessarily an animal\u2019). In his view the inference is not\nvalid, because a transition is made from necessary being to a being at\na certain time. For Peter then, the notion of necessity ultimately\nrefers to a necessary state of affairs in reality, something that is\nalways the case.\n\nA fusion of the domains of language and reality also turns up in\nPeter\u2019s account of the consecutive \u2018if\u2019, which he\nexplains as signifying causality. Like his contemporaries he looks\ninto the question whether from something impossible anything follows.\nIn his account, the notion of \u2018impossibility\u2019 can be taken\nin two ways, viz. impossibility as such (or absolute impossibility),\nwhich amounts to nothing, or some impossible state of affairs, that is\na combination of notions that do have a real foundation but are\nincompatible. From the latter type of impossibility, such as \u2018A\nman is an ass\u2019, something, but not anything can follow, e.g.,\n\u2018Therefore a man is an animal\u2019. From impossibilities as\nsuch, e.g., \u2018You know that you are a stone\u2019, nothing can\nfollow. The fundamental idea is that in order for something to follow\nfrom an antecedent, the antecedent in the consecutive relationship\nmust be a something (res) of some sort (see Spruyt 1993, pp.\n161\u2013193).\n",
