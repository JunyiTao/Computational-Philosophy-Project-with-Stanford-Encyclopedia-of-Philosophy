    "main_text": "The Romantic Turn\n2. The Romantic Turn\n\nSchlegel\u2019s intellectual biography begins in what is usually\ninterpreted as a \u201cclassicist\u201d phase. In his early\nStudium essay, Schlegel claimed that Greek poetry was\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d while modern poetry was only\n\u201cinteresting\u201d (interessant): ancient poetry\nstrove for an ideal and was \u201cobjective,\u201d while modern\npoetry was \u201ccharacteristic\u201d and strove for an originality\nthat was \u201cindividual\u201d or \u201cmannered.\u201d (A\nsimilar distinction, as many critics have noted, can be found in\nSchiller\u2019s contemporaneous work On Naive and Sentimental\nPoetry. Schlegel apparently arrived at his distinction\nindependently, although when he did encounter Schiller\u2019s essay, it\nprompted him to reconsider his approach to more contemporary\nliterature: see Eichner 1970, chapter 2, and Schlegel\u2019s later preface\nto the Studium essay.)\n\nIn the years following the Studium essay, Schlegel moved not\nonly to a distinction between the classical and the romantic, as\nopposed to that between the ancient and modern, but moreover began\ndistinctly to privilege the romantic. What Schlegel meant by the term\n\u201cromantic\u201d (romantisch) and its apparent cognate\nRoman (usually translated as \u201cnovel,\u201d but having\namong the Romantics a much wider sense) has long been disputed.\nPerhaps under the influence of Herder (see Eichner 1956), Schlegel saw\nthe historical origins of \u201cthe romantic\u201d in the wide\nmixture of forms and genres that characterized medieval literature and\ntook it as the point of departure for a genre-transcending notion that\nallows even Shakespeare\u2019s plays or Dante\u2019s Commedia to be\nclassified as Romane. Seen from this historical perspective,\nthe Roman becomes the central dividing line between ancient\nliterature and the literature of the current age: Greek poetry, he\nclaimed in 1800, \u201cbegan with and finally again converged in\nepic; our poetry began with and finally again will converge in the\nRoman.\u201d\n\nThe shift between Schlegel\u2019s classicist and romantic phases presents\nan interpretive challenge that is frequently discussed in the\nliterature. On the one hand, scholars have stressed that what Schlegel\nnow commends in romantic poetry are the very same facets he had\npreviously condemned (for example, Eichner 1970, 49, who lists here\nthe tendency toward the purely imaginative; the mixing of genres; the\ntrend toward didacticism, irony and parody; the fusion of poetry and\nphilosophy). On the other hand, many have noticed that there are seeds\nin the Studium essay of the later view\u2014Schlegel\u2019s\npraise of poets like Dante, Goethe and Shakespeare often seems at odds\nwith the essay\u2019s valorization of ancient poetry.\n\nOne of the most important expressions of Schlegel\u2019s claims for the\nromantic can be found in the much-discussed\nAthenaeumsfragment 116: Romantic poetry is said there to be a\n\u201cprogressive, universal poetry, \u2026 the only kind of poetry\nthat is more than a kind, that is, as it were, poetry itself: for in a\ncertain sense all poetry is or should be romantic.\u201d The task of\nsuch poetry, he claims in this fragment, should be to \u201cfuse\npoetry and prose, inspiration and criticism, the poetry of art and the\npoetry of nature; and make poetry lively and sociable, and life and\nsociety poetical; poeticize wit and fill and saturate the forms of art\nwith every kind of good, solid matter for instruction, and animate\nthem with the pulsations of humor.\u201d In a similar vein, he raises\nthe stakes for what should be achieved by the genre that is not merely\na genre\u2014the novel: a \u201cgenuine theory of poetry would be a\ntheory of the novel,\u201d he claims.\n\nSchlegel does seem to acknowledge at times that his claims for the\nromantic border on the overly expansive (or, some would prefer, on the\ninherently incomplete or uncompletable). In a 1793 letter to his\nbrother, he said: \u201cI cannot send you my explanation of the word\n\u2018romantic\u2019 because it would be 125 sheets long\u201d\n(cited in Beiser, 1992, 410, n 67). Schlegel\u2019s bold envisioning of the\nromantic and the Roman are, however, part of a larger project\nin poetics and aesthetics concerned with finding a standard of\njudgment appropriate to the individuality of artistic and literary\nworks.\n",
