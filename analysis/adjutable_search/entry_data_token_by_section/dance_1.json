    "main_text": "Analytic Ontology of Dance as Art || Problem(s) of Identity and Reconstruction\n1.1 Problem(s) of Identity and Reconstruction\n\nAs mentioned briefly in the section above, there are many problems of\nidentity for dance that arise in analytic aesthetics (cf. Fraleigh\n2004 for an alternative usage of the word \u201cidentity\u201d for\ndance). One is that the moment that a dance is composed does not\n\u201cfix\u201d the dance for all time in that form. Dances are\nusually known by the name and date of their first performance but\nsubsequent performances and casts can change the structural and other\nqualitative features that were present in the original performance.\nFurther, as mentioned earlier, many dances have no notated score and,\nif they are preserved via video or other method, subsequent\nperformances can still deviate from these frameworks in significant\nand perhaps identity-changing ways. In addition, even where there is a\nscore, it may not result in performances from that score that are\nexperientially identifiable as the \u201csame\u201d work of art. A\ndance notation might also function as the jumping-off point from which\nto make a radically new kind of dance rather than a limitation on\ninnovation and changes to which a dance choreographer or set of\nperformers must adhere. There is also the issue that what a dance\n\u201cis\u201d in practice or for appreciation, in its\n\u201cessential\u201d features (if there are any), may not be\nidentical with what a dance \u201cis\u201d for purposes of numerical\nidentity and historical preservation. In this way dance is not unlike\nmusic (for more on this S. Davies 1991). (See Armelagos and Sirridge\n1978; D. Davies 2011b; Goodman 1976; McFee 2011b and 2018 for more on\nthis particular debate. Cf. S. Davies 1991 for a relevant discussion\nin the philosophy of music and Meskin 1999 for an alternative view of\ndancework ontology that holds that dance audiences experience\nthree works of art: 1) a choreographic-work, 2) a\nproduction-work, and 3) a performance-interpretation work.)\n\nFor more on the question of \u201cWhat is Dance?\u201d see D. Carr\n1997; Cohen 1982; Conroy 2015 (who provides an account of dance as\ngestural fiction); McFee 1994 and 1998a; Rubidge 2000; Sparshott 1988\nand 1995; Thomas 2018; and Van Camp 1981.\n",
