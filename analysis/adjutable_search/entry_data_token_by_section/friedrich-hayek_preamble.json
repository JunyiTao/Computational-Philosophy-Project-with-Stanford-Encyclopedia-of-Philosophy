    "main_text": "\n\nFriedrich Hayek was born in Vienna in 1899 into a family steeped in\nacademic life and scientific research. He worked as a statistician\nfrom 1927\u201331, became a Lecturer in Economics at the University\nof Vienna in 1929, then moved to the University of London in 1931, the\nUniversity of Chicago in 1950, and the University of Freiburg in 1962,\nretiring in 1967. He kept writing into the 1980s, dying in 1992.\n\nHayek worked in the areas of philosophy of science, political\nphilosophy, the free will problem, and epistemology. For all that,\nHayek was more hedgehog than fox. His life\u2019s work, for which he\nwon a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974, illuminated the nature and\nsignificance of spontaneous order. The concept seems simple, yet Hayek\nspent six decades refining his idea, evidently finding elusive the\ngoal of being as clear about it as he aspired to be.\n\nThis essay concentrates on this enduring theme of Hayek\u2019s work,\nand a question: why would the scholar who did more than anyone in the\ntwentieth century to advance our understanding of price signals and\nthe emergence of spontaneous orders also be driven to claim\n\u201cthat social justice is a mirage\u201d (Hayek 1978b, 57)?\n",
