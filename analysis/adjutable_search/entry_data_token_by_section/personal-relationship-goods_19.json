    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods and Distributive Justice || State Neutrality\n5.1 State Neutrality\n\nPeople vary in the weight they give to personal relationship goods in\ntheir views of how to live, and different ways of distributing\npersonal relationship goods will inevitably reflect some, but not\nother, individuals\u2019 conception of the good. There may be no\nneutral justification for particular ways of attempting to\ndistribute certain relationship goods\u2014even if there are some\nneutral justifications for wanting to distribute some of them in the\nfirst place. To decide on any particular set of institutions, one\nwould need to know how to balance the distribution of a relationship\ngood against the distribution of another, or perhaps against the\ndistribution of non-relational goods. More generally, including\npersonal relationship goods amongst the primary goods will raise the\nindexing problem (Brake 2017) by making it difficult to establish who\nare the worse off without assigning relative weights to different\ngoods such as money and personal relationship goods. Doing this would\ninvolve some kind of perfectionism.\n\nAgainst this worry, Brake thinks that making caring relationships and\ntheir goods available to all \u201cis relatively low cost and does\nnot interfere with implementing the existing principles\u201d (Brake\n2017, 141), and, in particular, \u201cit would not conflict with\ndistribution of income and wealth\u201d (Brake 2017, 143). Yet, it is\nnot clear this would solve the indexing problem, since trade-offs will\nstill be needed. Moreover, funding institutions and programs to\nfacilitate access to personal relationship goods (of the kind\ndiscussed in\n section 4)\n could be costly, partly because caring relationships and the personal\nrelationship goods they provide take time, and time is expensive. The\nprovision of most personal relationship goods cannot happen without\npeople spending enough time together. For instance, providing parents,\nor adult children, with care breaks and flexible working hours is\ngoing to be expensive.\n\nAlso, supporting these relationships could take particular forms, each\nof which may reflect different conceptions of the good. Should we\nensure that people may work shorter hours in order to have more time\nfor their personal relationships, or should the state create good\ncaring institutions to try and meet children\u2019s interests in\npersonal relationship goods outside the family, and possibly more\nefficiently? Adults who prefer to work (and earn) more will favor the\nlatter solution, while those who give more weight to personal\nrelationships will favor the former, and there may not be any neutral\njustification to prefer one solution over the other. Similarly, some\npeople will prefer that society be shaped such that the elderly have\nan opportunity to be cared for by their adult children, while others\nwill favor having opportunities to institutional care-giving, or\ncare-giving provided by strangers. In ideal circumstances, all these\npreferences could be equally accommodated\u2014but if and when this\nis not possible, how to decide?\n\nOne possibility is to appeal to a Dworkinian hypothetical insurance\nscheme (Dworkin 2000) to establish a way of distributing personal\nrelationship goods without violating state neutrality (see Bou-Habib\n2013 for an application of this device to the question of individual\naccess to the material resources needed for child-rearing). For this\nwe should be able to determine what opportunities for personal\nrelationship goods would the average person chose for herself, under\nconditions of perfect information and rationality.\n",
