Self-Consciousness in Experience\n\nSome philosophers maintain that, in addition to its manifestation in\nfirst-personal thinking, self-consciousness is also present in various\nforms of sensory and non-sensory experience (Berm\u00fadez 1998;\nHurley 1998: ch. 4; Zahavi 2005; Peacocke 2014; Musholt 2015). After\nall, self-consciousness is presumably a form of consciousness (see\nentry on\n consciousness).\n On the view that experience, like thought, has representational\ncontent, this can be understood as the view that experiences, like\nthoughts, can have content that is first-personal. On the further view\nthat the content of experience is non-conceptual (see the entry on\n non-conceptual\n mental content), the claim is that there is non-conceptual\nfirst-person content (for a conceptualist response, see No\u00eb\n2002). Berm\u00fadez also argues that there is a non-conceptual form\nof self-conscious thinking that arises from non-conceptual\nself-conscious experience, which he calls \u201cprotobelief\u201d\n(Berm\u00fadez 1998: ch. 5; cf. Berm\u00fadez 2003).\n\nThe claim that there is a form of self-consciousness in experience,\none which arguably grounds the capacity to entertain first-personal\nthought, can be understood in a number of ways. According to one view\nthere is a perceptual, or quasi-perceptual, consciousness of the self\nas an object of experience. On another, there is a\n\u201cpre-reflective\u201d form of self-consciousness that does not\ninvolve the awareness of the self as an object. A third claims that\nvarious forms of experience involve a distinctive \u201csense of\nownership\u201d in which each of us is aware of our own states as\nour own. In each case, the question is whether the mode of\nexperience in question can, in Peacocke\u2019s (2014: ch. 4) words,\nact as the \u201cnon-conceptual parent\u201d of the first-person\nconcept and associated phenomena, in particular that of immunity to\nerror through misidentification.\n",
