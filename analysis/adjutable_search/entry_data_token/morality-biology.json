Overview: Basic Issues, Questions, and Distinctions\n\nVery little in the study of human life has been left untouched by\ndevelopments in evolutionary biology, and inquiry into the nature of\nmorality is no exception. With the recognition that we, like all other\nliving things, belong to a species that has evolved through natural\nselection comes the acknowledgement that evolutionary processes have\nlikewise shaped us deeply. How deeply?\n\nEvolutionary explanations are commonplace when it comes to questions\nabout our physiological nature\u2014why we have opposable thumbs,\nsay, or a bipedal posture. But even a brief look at other animals\naffords countless examples of adaptive psychological and\nbehavioral traits as well\u2014appetites for food or sex,\nfear responses, patterns of aggression, parental care and bonding, or\npatterns of cooperation and retribution; and these traits are likewise\noften best explained as biological adaptations, i.e., traits that\nevolved through natural selection due to their adaptive effects. (We\nwill go through a striking example involving cooperative behavior in\nsection 2.2.) This raises the question: to what extent might human\npsychological and behavioral traits similarly reflect our own\nevolutionary heritage?\n\nWhen it comes to morality, the most basic issue concerns our\ncapacity for normative guidance: our ability to be motivated\nby norms of behavior and feeling through judgments about how\npeople ought to act and respond in various circumstances\n(Joyce 2006, Kitcher 2006a,b, 2011, and Machery and Mallon 2010). Is\nthis human capacity a biological adaptation, having perhaps conferred\na selective advantage on our hominin ancestors by enhancing social\ncohesion and cooperation? (\u2018Hominin\u2019 refers, as did\n\u2018hominid\u2019 until very recently, to Homo sapiens\ntogether with fossil species of ape to which Homo sapiens are\nmore closely related than we are to chimpanzees; these include the\nAustralopithecines, extinct species of Homo, etc., making up\nthe tribe Hominini within the sub-family Homininae.)\n\nIf so, then it would be part of evolved human nature\nto employ moral judgment in governing human behavior, rather than a\nmere \u201ccultural veneer\u201d artificially imposed on an amoral\nhuman nature (de Waal 2006). This would be a significant result, and\nit is only the beginning of the intriguing questions that arise at the\nintersection of morality and evolutionary biology. Researchers are\nalso interested in the possibility of more specific forms of\nevolutionary influence. Are there, for example, emotional adaptations\nthat influence the very content of moral judgments and\nbehavior, even today?\n\nFor example, many of us believe that among our various moral duties,\nwe have special and stringent duties toward family members. Might this\n\u2018moral intuition\u2019 be attributable, at least in part, to an\nevolved tendency to favor members of one\u2019s kin group over others,\nanalogous to similar traits in other animals? Even where moral beliefs\nare heavily shaped by culture, there might be such evolutionary\ninfluences in the background: evolved psychological traits may have\ncontributed to the shaping of cultural practices themselves,\ninfluencing, for example, the development of \u201cfamily\nfirst\u201d cultural norms that inform our judgments. Similarly with\na tendency more generally to favor members of one\u2019s own group\n(however defined) over outsiders.\n\nThe above sorts of questions, which are receiving growing attention in\nthe sciences, all pertain to morality understood as a set of\nempirical phenomena to be explained: it is an empirical fact\nabout human beings that we make moral judgments, have certain feelings\nand behave in certain ways, and it is natural for the sciences to seek\ncausal explanations for such phenomena. At the same time, however, it\nis a very complex matter\u2014and one often neglected outside of\nphilosophy\u2014how such empirical, explanatory projects are related\nto the very different sets of questions and projects pursued by\nphilosophers when they inquire into the nature and source of\nmorality.\n\nMoral philosophers tend to focus on questions about the justification\nof moral claims, the existence and grounds of moral truths, and what\nmorality requires of us. These are very different from the empirical\nquestions pursued in the sciences, but how we answer each set of\nquestions may have implications for how we should answer the other. As\nwe will see, though the two sets of issues are distinct, the\nscientific explanatory projects raise potential challenges for certain\nphilosophical views, and at the same time attention to philosophical\nissues raises doubts about some of the explanatory claims made in the\nname of science, which often rely on controversial\nphilosophical assumptions. Progress in this area will not be made\neither by doing moral philosophy in isolation from the sciences or by\ntaking morality out of the hands of philosophers and looking to\nscientific inquiry in isolation. More promising would be a careful\nexamination of the ways in which the scientific and philosophical\nprojects inform each other.\n1.1 Three Kinds of Appeal to Evolution in Evolutionary Ethics\n\nTalk of \u2018evolutionary ethics\u2019 may suggest a well-defined\nfield of inquiry, but in practice it can refer to any or all of the\nfollowing:\n\nDescriptive Evolutionary Ethics: appeals to evolutionary\ntheory in the scientific explanation of the origins of certain human\ncapacities, tendencies, or patterns of thought, feeling and behavior.\nFor example: the appeal to natural selection pressures in the distant\npast to explain the evolution of a capacity for normative guidance, or\nmore specifically the origins of our sense of fairness or our\nresentment of cheaters. (See section 2.)\nPrescriptive Evolutionary Ethics: appeals to evolutionary\ntheory in justifying or undermining certain normative ethical claims\nor theories\u2014for example, to justify free market capitalism or\nmale-dominant social structures, or to undermine the claim that human\nbeings have a special dignity that non-human animals lack. (See\nsection 3.)\nEvolutionary Metaethics: appeals to evolutionary theory\nin supporting or undermining various\n metaethical\n theories (i.e., theories about moral discourse and its\nsubject matter)\u2014for example, to support a non-cognitivist\naccount of the semantics of moral judgment (the idea that moral\njudgments do not purport to represent moral facts but instead just\nexpress emotions, attitudes or commitments), or to undermine the claim\nthat there are objective moral values, or to cast doubt on whether we\ncould have justified beliefs about such values. (See section 4.)\n\n\nAll three types of project have broadly to do with how\nneo-Darwinian evolutionary theory might bear on our understanding of\nethics or morality. The driving questions, concerns,\nmethodologies and implications, however, differ greatly among these\nthree lines of inquiry.\n\nImportantly, there are no simple or straightforward moves from the\nscientific projects in A to the philosophical projects in B or C.\nArguments for or against such moves require difficult philosophical\nwork. Moreover, philosophical issues relevant to C can have an\nimportant bearing on at least some of the scientific explanatory\nprojects in A. This puts important constraints on how much can\nconfidently be said in favor of such scientific explanations given\nongoing controversy over the philosophical issues.\n\nIt is, for example, a matter of live debate in contemporary metaethics\nwhether there are knowable moral truths\u2014correct answers\nto at least some questions about what is morally good or bad, right or\nwrong. If there are, as many philosophers (and non-philosophers)\nbelieve, then this will likely make a difference to the explanation of\nat least some of our moral beliefs and behaviors. Our belief\nin equal human dignity, for example, along with derivative beliefs\nabout the wrongness of slavery or rape, might be sufficiently\nexplained by our having grasped the moral truth that human beings have\nsuch dignity and so should not be treated as \u201cmere means\u201d\n(see section 2.4). Similarly, the belief that we have moral\nobligations to mitigate suffering even among distant strangers might\nbe explained at least in part by our having grasped the moral fact\nthat pointless suffering is intrinsically bad and that this gives us\ngood reason to mitigate it where we can.\n\nIf this is so, then scientists will be overreaching if they claim that\n\u201ccausal explanations of brain activity and\nevolution\u2026already cover most known facts about behavior we term\n\u2018moral\u2019\u201d (Wilson 1998, 54). Instead, a significant\namount of moral judgment and behavior may be the result of gaining\nmoral knowledge, rather than just reflecting the causal conditioning\nof evolution. This might apply even to universally held moral\nbeliefs or distinctions, which are often cited as evidence of an\nevolved \u201cuniversal moral grammar\u201d (Mikhail 2011). For\nexample, people everywhere and from a very young age distinguish\nbetween violations of merely conventional norms and\nviolations of norms involving harm, and they are strongly\ndisposed to respond to suffering with concern (Nichols 2004). But even\nif this partly reflects evolved psychological mechanisms or\n\u2018modules\u2019 governing social sentiments and responses, much\nof it may also be the result of human intelligence grasping\n(under varying cultural conditions) genuine morally relevant\ndistinctions or facts\u2014such as the difference between the\nnormative force that attends harm and that which attends mere\nviolations of convention.\n\nWe will look in more detail later at this and other possibilities for\nexplaining moral judgment and behavior. The point so far is just that\nthere are plausible philosophical accounts of at least some moral\njudgment and behavior that appeal to independent exercises of\njudgment\u2014perhaps in grasping moral truths, or perhaps just in\nforming reflective commitments\u2014rather than to causal\nconditioning by evolutionary factors. There is a danger, then, of\nbegging central questions if we draw general conclusions\nabout \u201cthe\u201d explanation of \u201cour\u201d moral thought\nand behavior based on scientific considerations\u2014as is common in\ndiscussions of scientific work in this area. We may instead need a\nplurality of explanatory models. The best explanation for deeply\nreflective moral judgments may look quite different from the\nexplanation for unreflective psychological dispositions we share with\nother primates, and there may be mixed explanations for much that lies\nin between.\n1.2 The Empirical and Normative Senses of \u2018Morality\u2019\n\nAs a final preliminary point, it is useful to clear up one persistent\nsource of confusion in discussions of morality and evolution by\ndistinguishing between two very different senses of\n\u2018morality\u2019 and describing more explicitly the different\nsets of questions associated with them.\n\nThe Empirical Sense of \u2018Morality\u2019\n\n\nPeople coming from a scientific perspective, who are interested in\ndescriptive evolutionary ethics, speak of morality as\nsomething to be explained scientifically\u2014as in familiar talk of\n\u201chow morality evolved\u201d. Here \u2018morality\u2019\nrefers, as noted earlier, to a certain set of empirical\nphenomena, such as the observed capacity of human beings to make\nnormative judgments, or the tendency to have certain sentiments such\nas sympathy or guilt or blame, or certain \u2018intuitions\u2019\nabout fairness or violence. Just as we can inquire into the origins\nand functions of other traits, such as human linguistic capacities, we\ncan inquire into the origins and functions of the various\npsychological capacities and tendencies associated with\n\u2018morality\u2019.\n\nThe sense of \u2018morality\u2019 in the above questions may be\ncalled the empirical sense of the term, and it is in this\nsense that scientists speak of \u201cthe evolution of\nmorality,\u201d using such tools as comparative genomics and primate\nstudies to shed light on it (Rosenberg 2006; de Waal 1996 and 2006).\nSuch explanatory projects will be discussed in section 2.\n\nThe Normative Sense of \u2018Morality\u2019\n\n\nIn contrast to the above, there is a very different use of the term\n\u2018morality\u2019 in what may be called the normative\nsense. Consider the question: \u201cDoes morality require\nthat we make substantial sacrifices to help distant strangers?\u201d\nSuch a question arises from the deliberative standpoint as we seek to\ndetermine how we ought to live, and it is a normative rather than an\nempirical question. We are not here asking an anthropological question\nabout some actual moral code\u2014even that of our own\nsociety\u2014but a normative question that might lead us to a new\nmoral code. When we use \u2018morality\u2019 in the normative sense,\nit is meant to refer to however it is we ought to live, i.e.,\nto a set of norms that ought to be adopted and\n followed.[2]\n\nPhilosophers employ this normative sense of \u2018morality\u2019 or\n\u2018moral\u2019 in posing a variety of both normative and\nmetaethical questions: What does morality require of us? Does morality\nhave a purely consequentialist structure, as utilitarians claim? What\nkind of meaning do claims about morality in the normative sense have?\nAre there moral truths\u2014i.e., truths about morality in the\nnormative sense\u2014and if so, what are they grounded in and how can\nwe come to know them? Is morality culturally relative or at least\npartly universal? (Note that this is not the same as the\nanthropological question whether or to what extent morality\nin the empirical sense varies from culture to\nculture.)\n\nWhile morality in the normative sense is not an empirical phenomenon\nto be explained, there are still important questions to ask about how\nevolutionary theory may bear on it. Can we look to our evolutionary\nbackground for moral guidance, gaining insight into the content of\nmorality in the normative sense (as claimed by proponents of\nprescriptive evolutionary ethics)? (Section 3) Does\nevolutionary theory shed light on metaethics, helping to resolve\nquestions about the existence and nature of morality\nin the normative sense (as claimed by proponents of evolutionary\nmetaethics)? Does it, for example, lend support to nihilism (the idea\nthat there is really no such thing as morality\nin the normative sense) or to skepticism (the idea that even if\nthere are truths about morality in the normative sense we cannot know\nthem, or at least could not know them if they were objective truths)?\n(Section 4)\n\nHaving distinguished various issues and questions, we may turn now to\nconsider first the scientific explanatory projects concerning morality\nin the empirical sense.\n2. Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics: Explaining Morality in the Empirical Sense\n\nEvolutionary explanations for morality in the empirical sense are\noffered at different levels, and this makes for very different\nexplanatory projects with different implications. Some typical\nexplananda in accounts of \u201cthe evolution of\nmorality\u201d are:\n\nThe general capacity for normative judgment and guidance, and the\ntendency to exercise this capacity in social life;\nThe capacity for certain sentiments and the ability to detect them\nin others;\nThe tendency to experience and to be motivated by certain\nsentiments in certain types of situation;\nThe tendency to make certain particular kinds of moral judgment or\ninference, or to have certain characteristic moral intuitions (i.e., a\n\u2018moral sense\u2019);\nThe tendency to exhibit certain particular types of behavior in\ncertain types of situation (as a result of D);\nThe tendency of societies to exhibit certain particular systems of\nnorms or types of practice (due to D and E).\n\n2.1 Levels and Types of Explanation: Some Possibilities\n\nIt is uncontroversial that there will be evolutionary explanations of\nsome sort for the very general capacities and tendencies in A\nand B: we are evolved creatures, and our psychological capacities,\nlike other complex capacities, are outcomes of evolutionary processes.\nBut this does not by itself settle whether these capacities and\ntendencies are themselves adaptations, having evolved through\nnatural selection because of their adaptive effects. That is the most\ncommon view (further explored below), but there are alternatives.\n\nIt is possible, for example, that our capacity to make moral judgments\nis a spin-off (side-effect or by-product) of our non-moral\nintellectual capacities, which latter are\n adaptations.[3]\n On this view, we tend to make moral judgments because we are\nintellectual and reflective creatures, not because natural selection\nhas specifically given us this moral capacity and tendency as an\nadaptation; the role of natural selection would be indirect, supplying\nmore general capacities as adaptations, from which specifically moral\ntendencies spring independently (Ayala 2006; Prinz 2008, Machery and\nMallon 2010).\n\nThe deeper point, however, is that whichever position one\ntakes on the role of natural selection in the emergence of generic\ncapacities for moral judgment, this does not settle how best to\naccount for other, more specific tendencies, such as C-F. In\nparticular:\n\nEven if (1) our capacity and tendency to make moral judgments\nis an adaptation that evolved through natural selection, it\nremains possible that (2) the content of particular moral\njudgments is derived autonomously, i.e., free from causal\nshaping by particular elements in our evolutionary background\u2014in\nroughly the way that the contents of our beliefs in physics or\nphilosophy seem to be (see section 2.4 below).\nAlternatively, even if (1*) our capacity and tendency to make\nmoral judgments is not itself an adaptation, it remains\npossible that (2*) the content of particular moral judgments\nis deeply shaped by evolved emotional dispositions that have\naffected the content of moral judgments since human beings began\nmaking them. Such emotional adaptations may thus have influenced\ncultural norms throughout history and may continue to influence our\nmoral judgments, and hence our behavior, today.\n\n\nAnd of course there are other possibilities: 1 might be combined with\n2*, or 1* might be combined with 2, and both 2 and 2* could also be\nweakened to apply only to some judgments, while others are\nexplained in other ways, as suggested earlier. There are, then, many\npossible stories to be told about the origins of our moral judgments\nand behavior.\n\nSince our concern is with morality, the crucial issue to\nbegin with is the origins of moral judgment: for morality has\nnot merely to do with certain emotions and behaviors (such as sympathy\nand altruism) as such, but with the exercise of moral\njudgment about how one ought to behave in various social\ncircumstances (Joyce 2006, ch. 2; Korsgaard 2006; Kitcher 2006c, 2011;\nMachery and Mallon 2010). Certain emotions and behaviors are then\nrelevant too insofar as they relate to the exercise of such judgment,\nbut in the absence of moral judgment they seem only to belong to\nproto-morality.\n\nStill, many discussions employ a looser notion of\n\u2018morality\u2019 that refers simply to certain kinds of socially\npositive emotion or behavior, such as psychological altruism\n(defined below). Since accounts of the origins of moral judgment rely\non these ideas as well, and these emotions or behavioral dispositions\nare also often appealed to as causal influences on the content of\nmoral judgment, it is worth starting with a look at the issue of\npsychological altruism, distinguishing it from merely biological\naltruism.\n2.2 Biological and Psychological Altruism\n\nMany discussions of morality and evolutionary biology focus largely on\nthe issue of altruistic feeling and behavior. This can be\nconfusing because in addition to psychological altruism there\nis also biological altruism, which is found in many species.\n(See Kitcher 2011, part I, for a comprehensive discussion.)\nPsychological altruism involves caring about others\u2019 welfare\nand deliberately benefiting them for their own sake,\nwith no restriction on the type of benefit involved. By contrast,\nbiological altruism has nothing essentially to do with intentions or\nmotives, and it pertains only to \u2018benefits\u2019 to others that\nincrease their reproductive fitness (boosting their genetic\ncontribution to future generations).\n\nThough psychological altruism is different from biological altruism,\nthere are a variety of possible explanations of the evolution of\npsychological altruism that appeal to the same factors that explain\nthe origins of biological altruism, namely:\n\nKin selection or \u2018inclusive fitness\u2019 theory\n(Hamilton 1964);\nSelection pressures leading to teamwork, reciprocal\naltruism (Trivers 1971; Maynard Smith 1982; Axelrod 1984) and\nindirect reciprocity (Alexander 1987; Joyce 2006); and\nGroup selection (Sober and Wilson 1998).\n\n\nIt would take us too far afield to survey all these biological\naccounts in detail, the background for which is already treated in the\nentry for\n biological altruism;\n there are also many excellent and accessible summaries of such\naccounts and their application to psychological altruism (e.g., Joyce\n2006, ch. 1). We will settle here for one detailed illustration of one\nway in which biological altruism can be given an evolutionary\nexplanation, followed by a sketch of the ways in which this and other\nevolutionary mechanisms might likewise explain the emergence of\npsychological altruism\u2014keeping in mind that this is all\njust one part of explaining morality proper, to which we\nreturn in the next sub-section.\n\nThe very idea that biological altruism can come about through natural\nselection may initially seem puzzling. One way of characterizing\nnatural selection, after all, is in terms of \u201cselfish\ngenes\u201d: natural selection occurs when a variant of a gene (an\nallele) at a given locus tends to cause a modification of a bodily or\nbehavioral trait (a phenotypic trait) in a way that, in the overall\nenvironment, tends to cause that variant of the gene to increase its\nrelative frequency in the next generation; this then increases the\nrepresentation of the associated trait modification as well. Typically\nthis happens when the phenotypic modification is one that causes the\norganism to have greater reproductive success: if, in the overall\ncontext, allele A causes its carrier to have a trait T that causes the\norganism to have more offspring than other organisms in the population\nwho carry rival allele A* and display alternative trait T*, then A\nwill be inherited and carried by more organisms in succeeding\ngenerations; and that means that T will likewise be displayed by more\norganisms (Dawkins, 1989). But how do we get from \u201cselfish\ngenes\u201d increasing their representation in the gene pool, via\nimproving the reproductive success of their carriers, to such things\nas cooperation and biological altruism? It turns out there are many\nways.\n\nTo take one dramatic example, consider social insect colonies, and in\nparticular, the Hymenoptera (bees, ants and wasps). In these colonies\nwe find such an extreme degree of cooperation\u2014division of labor\n(queen, workers, soldiers, etc.), food-sharing, information\nsharing\u2014that it is tempting to view the entire colony as a\nsingle functioning organism. Indeed, in the case of stinging worker\nhoney bees, there is not only cooperative labor but also, when\nnecessary, the ultimate sacrifice in defense of the hive (at least\nwhere the invader is a mammal, stinging of which proves fatal to the\nbee as the barbed sting is torn out upon being deposited in the\nvictim). How can such striking cooperation and self-sacrifice be\nexplained in evolutionary terms?\n\nOne important fact to notice is that the colony is one large family:\ntypically, the workers are sisters\u2014daughters of the queen.\nReturn to the idea of \u201cselfish genes\u201d described above:\nwhat ultimately increases an allele\u2019s representation in the gene\npool is its having some phenotypic effect that causes copies of that\nallele to be in more organisms in succeeding generations. That\nnormally happens when the phenotypic effect causes the organism to\nhave greater reproductive success, but it can equally happen if it\ncauses the organism\u2019s close kin to have greater reproductive\nsuccess: for close kin are likely to carry copies of that same allele,\nwhich means that greater reproductive success for kin likewise\npropagates copies of the allele. So while an allele that causes an\norganism to engage in sex more often may thereby spread, so might an\nallele that causes an organism to help a sibling to reproduce (as by\naiding survival); either way, that allele will be helping to propagate\ncopies of itself in the next generation, which in turn means that the\nhelping behavior it causes will likewise spread over time (Dawkins\n1989, 171\u201377).\n\nThis mechanism of \u201ckin selection\u201d can explain how worker\nbees evolved such apparently \u2018selfless\u2019 traits, focused on\naiding the queen\u2019s survival and reproduction. In fact, the\nsituation is even more interesting and extreme: workers have evolved\nto serve the queen\u2019s reproduction at the complete expense of their\nown, as they are sterile. This extreme biological altruism,\nhowever, may be explained by the same principles, with the addition of\nthe fact that due to a genetic peculiarity of the Hymenoptera (their\nhaplodiploidy), sisters are more closely related to each\nother genetically than they would be to their own\n offspring.[4]\n This means that natural selection will actually favor worker traits\nthat help their mother reproduce (thus making more sisters,\nwho are especially likely to carry copies of the gene for that same\ntrait, making it spread), over traits in workers aimed at personal\nreproduction. This could explain how worker sterility evolved, as\ntraits focused on helping the queen took precedence over personal\nreproduction, and it explains how even suicidal behavior could have\nbeen selected for as propagating the genes that cause it (Dawkins\n1989, 174\u201375). (It is worth noting, however, that the theory of\nkin selection and inclusive fitness is highly complex and has received\nrenewed critical scrutiny in recent years. For a recent special\ncollection of articles on the topic see\n Royal Society Open Science on Inclusive Fitness).\n\nThis is only one example of one way in which biological altruism can\nevolve: there are others, which are not restricted to kin and are\nexplained using game-theoretic or group dynamic models (again, see the\nentry on\n biological altruism\n for details). The crucial point is just that any kind of\ngenetically-based trait can evolve if it happens to have the right\nkind of feedback effect on the genes that influence it. This brings\nus, then, to the sort of trait we are more interested in: a\ndisposition for psychological altruism, as defined above.\n\nAgain, while it may initially seem puzzling that evolution should give\nrise to psychological altruism, rather than merely to selfishness,\nthere is nothing paradoxical about it: a genetically-based disposition\nfor psychological altruism will evolve just in case such a trait, in\nthe relevant circumstances, promotes the propagation of the genes that\nbring it about (and does so more effectively than alternative traits\nproduced by rival alleles). And this can again happen in various\nways.\n\nThe basic idea is that psychological altruistic dispositions can\nevolve as proximate mechanisms or \u201cmodules\u201d for\npromoting the biological advantages relevant to the forms of selection\nlisted above. In some cases, these adaptive psychological mechanisms\nwill involve specifically targeted or conditional altruistic\nmotivations, involving capacities for discrimination to focus benefits\non kin or on reciprocators. In other cases, the selection pressures\nwill give rise to less discriminating altruistic sentiments and\ntendencies as the simplest and most cost-effective mechanisms for\npromoting adaptive cooperative behaviors in a given environment. If\nour hominin ancestors tended to live in circumstances where the\nopportunities for \u2018wasting\u2019 altruism in\nnon-fitness-enhancing ways (e.g., on \u2018outsiders\u2019) were\nsufficiently few and far between, then a simple, undiscriminating\n(though limited) sense of concern and altruism may have promoted\nfitness at far less cost than more discriminating forms, evolving more\nreadily. One advantage of this hypothesis is that it might help\nexplain some sorts of concern and altruism that are otherwise hard to\nmake sense of in evolutionary terms.\n\nFor example, suppose you receive a letter from UNICEF soliciting\ncontributions for health and nutrition programs for children in\nDarfur, and you are moved to send a check. This is not merely\nselective altruism toward kin or likely reciprocators, but altruism\ntoward strangers who are in no position to reciprocate, and it might\ntherefore seem puzzling from a purely biological point of view: such\n\u2018indiscriminate altruism\u2019 isn\u2019t biologically adaptive\nin the way more selective altruism might be; your helping children in\nDarfur isn\u2019t helping to propagate your own genes, so it may seem\nmysterious how such a trait could have evolved through natural\nselection. But a trait that is not presently adaptive may once have\nbeen. In the environment in which our hominin ancestors lived, where\nthere was little positive contact with outsiders, even relatively\nindiscriminate altruism would tend to benefit kin or potential\nreciprocators, and so might have been a simple adaptive mechanism on\nthe whole.\n\nIf so, then your presently non-adaptive altruistic behavior in our\ncurrent global environment could in principle be an expression of an\nevolved, indiscriminate altruistic tendency\u2014an adaptation that\nis largely no longer adaptive, and so would amount to a kind of\n\u2018misfiring\u2019 of formerly adaptive instincts (Dawkins 2006,\n220\u201321; Kitcher 2006b). It would be in this way on a par with\nour taste for fatty foods\u2014originally evolved for its adaptive\neffects though it is no longer beneficial in today\u2019s fast food\neconomy\u2014though in the case of altruism the\n\u2018misfiring\u2019 has happier results. Of course, it\u2019s also\npossible (as discussed in section 2.4) that your altruistic tendency\nisn\u2019t itself an adaptation at all, but is instead rooted in values\nthat you\u2019ve developed, through moral reflection in your cultural\ncontext, independently of specific evolutionary influences. Or it may\nbe some combination of the two.\n\nThis area of inquiry remains largely speculative, since it is one\nthing to develop models for how psychological altruism could in\nprinciple evolve, and quite another to show convincingly that a given\nform of natural selection has in fact played the relevant role in\nactual human evolutionary history. There may be doubts, for example,\nwhether there was sufficient pair-wise engagement in iterated\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma games to explain the evolution of reciprocal\naltruism according to some of the most familiar game-theoretic models\n(Kitcher 2006a,b). In any case, it is time to return to the issue of\nmoral judgment, which is crucial to the explanation of\nmorality proper, and goes beyond mere altruistic feeling and\nbehavior. The following sub-section describes one leading\nhypothesis.\n2.3 Explaining the Origins of Morality: From Psychological Altruism to the Evolution of Normative Guidance\n\nKitcher (2006a,b; 2011) has proposed a three-stage account of the\nevolution of morality. It begins with the evolution of an early but\nfragile form of psychological altruism among hominins in the context\nof \u201ccoalition games\u201d in mixed adult groups. The social\nstructure would have been similar to that of contemporary chimpanzees\nand bonobos, where cooperation among the relatively weak (or those in\nweak stages of life) is beneficial to them, but strategic calculation\nis infeasible. These conditions may have led from simpler forms of\nbiological altruism developed through kin selection to the evolution\nof a psychological altruistic disposition involving \u201ca blind\ntendency to respond to the preferences of another animal with whom you\nmight engage in cooperative activity,\u201d as a simple but effective\nmechanism for promoting advantageous participation in coalitions and\nsubcoalitions (Kitcher 2006b). (This is the\n\u2018indiscriminate\u2019 altruism discussed in the previous\nsub-section.)\n\nBecause this disposition was both limited and unstable, however, and\ncompeted with powerful selfish drives, there was a continual threat of\nsocial rupture and loss of cooperative advantage. This in turn would\nhave made ongoing peacemaking a necessity, thus limiting the size of\nviable cooperative units and the scope of cooperative projects, as\nwell as imposing significant costs through the devotion of time and\nenergy to peacemaking activities. An example would be extensive mutual\ngrooming going well beyond what is necessary for hygiene, of the sort\nfound in chimpanzee societies.\n\nThe next phase, according to this hypothesis, was a transition to much\nlarger groups with more extensive cooperative activities, through the\nevolution of a capacity for emotionally laden normative\nguidance, without which such arrangements would not have been\npossible. (See also Gibbard 1990, ch. 4.) With the emergence of a\ncapacity to make and follow normative judgments, reinforced by\ncoevolved reactive emotions such as guilt and resentment, and the\ndevelopment of rules and social practices promoting and enforcing\ngroup loyalty and cooperation, a new psychological mechanism came into\nbeing for reinforcing the previously unstable altruistic tendencies\nand promoting large-scale social cohesion and stability. The\nadvantages of membership in coalitions and subcoalitions would be\nconferred on hominins who had facility with such normative\nguidance\u2014including a strong sense of obligation and tendency\ntoward social compliance\u2014and who thus acted consistently on\nthese altruistic tendencies, acquiring the reputation for being good\ncoalition partners and participating in a broader array of cooperative\nprojects.\n\nIf this hypothesis is correct, it might explain not only the origins\nof our general capacity for normative judgment and motivation, but\nalso the widespread tendency for social rules or norms historically to\nemphasize such things as group identity, loyalty and\ncohesion, and to focus largely on the regulation of\nviolence and sex; and it might help to explain\nwidespread dispositions toward social conformity, concern with\nreputation and social standing, tendencies for group-wise scorning or\npunishment of the disloyal, and the power of emotions such as\nresentment, guilt and shame.\n\nIn the final phase, this sort of \u201cproto-morality\u201d of norms\nand reactive emotions would then be supplemented over thousands of\nyears with various paths of\n cultural evolution,\n leading to the development and fleshing out of the much more\nsophisticated systems of moral beliefs, practices and institutions\nwith which we are familiar, from the earliest historical examples\nright up to our present moral cultures (Kitcher 2006a, 2011). There\nis, of course, a great deal of leeway in the last part, concerning the\ndetails of the transition through cultural evolution from hominin\nproto-moralities to contemporary moral systems, which allows for some\nvery different possible stories. Some accounts will attribute great\ninfluence to evolved, \u201cdomain-specific psychological\nmodules\u201d (such as a dedicated mechanism that automatically\ngenerates a feeling of concern when confronted with suffering) in\nshaping the content of our moral feeling, judgment and behavior, both\nthrough shaping our cultures and more directly; other accounts, while\nnot denying some such influence, will emphasize very different factors\nas influencing the content of at least some of our moral beliefs (such\nas the \u201ccapacity for open-ended normativity\u201d cited by\nBuchanan and Powell 2015, 2018, 2019). This brings us to the next\nmajor topic.\n2.4 Autonomous Moral Reflection and the Explanation of Reasoned Moral Judgment and Behavior\n\nSo far, we have focused on scientific projects that treat morality in\nthe empirical sense as calling simply for causal explanation, as by\nappeal to evolutionary influences. This is unexceptionable with regard\nto the origins of the general human capacity for moral judgment:\nclearly some causal explanation is required, and an evolutionary\nexplanation is plausible. But things are much more complicated when we\nconsider the explanation of the actual content of moral\njudgment, feeling and behavior.\n\nWe have had a taste above of the way in which scientists might propose\nto explain our particular moral attitudes or judgments by appeal to\nspecific evolutionary causes as filtered through cultural\ndevelopments. Human beings have a strong, emotionally-laden sense of\nbasic fairness, resentment of cheaters, and a desire that they be\npunished, all of which finds expression in both cultural norms and\nindividual moral judgments. You might experience such feelings if\nyou\u2019ve been the victim of a scam, morally condemning the\nperpetrators. And some of these psychological traits may have\nanalogues in other species. For example, Sarah Brosnan and Frans de\nWaal (2014) argue that \u201cevidence indicates that [inequity\naversion, i.e., negative reactions to unequal\nrewards for similar tasks] is widespread in cooperative species\nunder many circumstances\u201d--though some have disputed this and\noffered alternative hypotheses to explain the behavior, based on\nfurther research (Engelmann, Clift, Herrmann, and Tomasello\n2017).[5]\nIn the simplest case, an animal\nprotests when it sees a companion receive a superior reward for a\nsimilar task, as in a well-known study with brown capuchin monkeys,\nthough similar effects have now been observed even in non-primates,\nsuch as dogs and crows. In the more complex\ncase, chimpanzees sometimes react negatively to inequity even\nwhere they are the ones receiving the greater reward. A natural\nevolutionary hypothesis for the simpler case is that such a\ndisposition protected against \u2018wasting\u2019 cooperative\nefforts where they were not fitness-enhancing. Similarly, a natural\nexplanatory hypothesis for the more complex form of inequity\naversion is that it evolved in creatures with sufficient\npredictive capacities and emotional control because it\npreserved beneficial cooperative relationships that could be\nthreatened by such inequities, thus proving fitness-enhancing on the\nwhole given the benefits of continued cooperation (Brosnan and de\nWaal, 2014). All of this might suggest good prospects for causal\nexplanation of human moral traits in terms of evolved psychological\ntraits. Indeed, Brosnan and de Waal explicitly hypothesize that the\nevolved complex response observed in champanzees is what\n\u201callowed the development of a complete sense of fairness in\nhumans, which aims not at equality for its own sake but for the sake\nof continued cooperation\u201d (Brosnan and de Waal, 2014).\n\nCaution is needed here, however. Our moral judgments and resulting\nbehaviors cannot just be assumed to be mere causal upshots of\nsome such biological and psychological forces, on a par with the\ncooperative activity of bees or the resentment felt by capuchin\nmonkeys (or even the broader unease apparently felt by chimpanzees)\nover unequal rewards for equal work. When a rational agent makes a\njudgment, whether in the sphere of morality or in such areas as\nscience, mathematics or philosophy, the proper question is not in the\nfirst instance what caused that judgment to occur, but what\nreasons the person had for making it\u2014for thinking it to\nbe true. It is those reasons that typically constitute an explanation\nof the judgment. They explain by bringing out what the person\ntook (rightly or wrongly) to be the justification\nfor the belief in question\u2014the considerations showing the belief\nlikely to be true. All of this complicates the explanatory project in\nrelation to the thoughts, feelings and actions of rational agents.\n\nIt is helpful to illustrate the general point first with other kinds\nof judgment, and then to return to morality. Consider some judgments\nin mathematics, philosophy and science:\n\n\nM: There is at least one prime number between 5,000 and 10,000.\n\nP: If identity claims such as \u2018water = H2O\u2019 are\ntrue, then they are necessary truths (i.e., true in all\npossible worlds).\n\nS: There is no such thing as absolute simultaneity.\n\n\nHow do we explain someone\u2019s believing something like M, P or S? We\nnormally need to know her reasons for believing it to be\ntrue, which we can then go on to assess as good or bad reasons for\nsuch a belief. Either way, we typically take her reasons\u2014and the\nreasoning associated with them\u2014to explain her belief,\nwhich is why we engage seriously with her reasons as such in critical\ndiscussion, and go on to inquire into their merits. If, for example,\nwe ask a person why she believes M, and she cites a proof she has\nfound convincing, showing that for any natural number n >\n1 there is at least one prime number between n and\n2n, we normally take this as a sufficient explanation for why\nshe believes M. What we do not normally do is to appeal\ndirectly to independent causes, such as evolutionary or other\nbiological or psychological influences to explain people\u2019s beliefs\nin these areas. Such independent explanations for beliefs can\nsometimes be correct, as in the case of someone given a post-hypnotic\nsuggestion, in which case we may regard her judgment as merely\ncaused and the reasons offered as mere rationalization. But this\nis not the norm.\n\nThe reason why we normally explain beliefs such as M, P or S by appeal\nto the reasons the person gives for them is that we normally assume\nthat the person is capable of intelligent reflection and reasoning and\nhas arrived at her belief for the reasons she gives as a result of\nthat reflection (whether or not the belief is ultimately correct). We\nassume in general that people are capable of significant\nautonomy in their thinking, in the following sense:\n\nAutonomy Assumption: people have, to greater or lesser\ndegrees, a capacity for reasoning that follows autonomous\nstandards appropriate to the subjects in question, rather than in\nslavish service to evolutionarily given instincts merely filtered\nthrough cultural forms or applied in novel environments. Such\nreflection, reasoning, judgment and resulting behavior seem to be\nautonomous in the sense that they involve exercises of\nthought that are not themselves significantly shaped by specific\nevolutionarily given tendencies, but instead follow independent norms\nappropriate to the pursuits in question (Nagel 1979).\n\n\nThis assumption seems hard to deny in the face of such abstract\npursuits as algebraic topology, quantum field theory, population\nbiology, modal metaphysics, or twelve-tone musical composition, all of\nwhich seem transparently to involve precisely such autonomous\napplications of human intelligence. Even if there are\nevolutionary influences behind our general tendency to engage in\ncertain kinds of mental activity, or behind some of our motives in\nthese pursuits (e.g., if a given musician or poet is motivated to\ncompose music or poetry in order to impress a potential mate), this\nwould not show that the activity is governed in its details by such\ninfluences (cf. Buchanan and Powell 2015, 2018, and 2019). And again,\nthis assumption of autonomy is borne out in our normal explanations of\nbeliefs such as P above: we take a person at her word that what\nexplains her believing P, for example, is that due to philosophical\narguments she\u2019s read and has found convincing she takes\n\u2018water\u2019 to work like a proper name and thinks that it\nfollows from this that \u2018water\u2019 refers to whatever\nmolecular compound it picks out in the actual world in all possible\nworlds in which the compound exists.\n\nFew would deny the autonomy assumption altogether. To do so in the\nname of providing alternative evolutionary causal explanations of our\nbeliefs would risk self-defeat: for if we lack the relevant\nintellectual autonomy across the board, then even the\nbiologist\u2019s beliefs about evolutionary biology and its\nimplications would just be attributable to such biological\ncauses, rather than to reasons that provide real warrant for such\nbeliefs within a rational framework with truth-tracking integrity. The\nchallenge to the autonomy assumption is therefore more likely to come\nin a selective\n form.[6]\n\nThis brings us back to moral judgment. As with M, P and S, people\ntypically have reasons for their moral judgments, and whether\nor not we agree with them, we typically take those reasons to explain\nwhy they believe what they do. Consider again the moral judgment\nmentioned earlier:\n\nMJ: The person who cheated me did something wrong and should be\npunished.\n\n\nJust as with M, P and S, someone making this judgment will have\nreasons that she takes to justify this claim, ultimately tying into\nher overall conception of right and wrong. And we tend to take this at\nface value as an explanation of why she believes MJ, unless we have\nspecial reason to suspect distorting causes, such as prejudice leading\nto misperception and rationalization. We tend to think that a person\nhas the moral beliefs she does as a result of background moral\nreflection and reasoning, within her cultural context. In other words,\nwe tend to treat a person\u2019s moral beliefs much as we treat her\nreasoned mathematical, scientific, or philosophical beliefs, applying\nthe autonomy assumption in seeking to explain why she believes what\nshe does.\n\nOne potential lesson from evolutionary biology, however, is that even\nif the autonomy assumption equally applies in principle to\nthe sphere of moral judgment, it may be a mistake just to assume that\nmost moral judgment and behavior is in fact a result of the exercise\nof such autonomous reflection, reasoning and judgment. The autonomy\nassumption, after all, says only that we have the capacity for\nrelevantly autonomous reflection and judgment; it does not imply that\nwe always exercise it. Perhaps the human capacity for autonomous\nthinking is exercised only in some cases, while in others the process\nthat leads to moral belief is largely influenced by evolved\npsychological dispositions, such as emotional adaptations. While such\na situation may not tend to arise in relation to our mathematical,\nphilosophical, or scientific thinking, our evolutionary history may\nhave given rise to emotional dispositions that play a significant role\nin at least some of our moral thinking, feeling and behavior. (See\nsection 2.5 below.)\n\nOne plausible story, then, is that while many of our more reflective\nand reasoned moral judgments involve autonomous exercises of\ndomain-general intelligence, many other less reflective moral\njudgments are largely attributable to evolutionary\ninfluences\u2014both through direct conditioning of people\u2019s\nmoral judgments by evolved, domain-specific psychological dispositions\nand through background influences on cultural factors. On this\nhypothesis, we cannot treat moral judgments as a homogeneous set, but\nmust recognize that they can come about in very different ways,\nrequiring a plurality of explanatory models. While a model of\nautonomous reasoning might apply to some moral beliefs and behaviors,\na model appealing to evolutionary causal influences will apply to\nothers. And often some combination of models may be necessary, as in\ncases where both evolutionary influences and our own independent moral\nreflection might lead to similar judgments, overdetermining\nthem.\n\nFor example, even if it is true that evolutionary pressures favoring\ncaring for offspring have strongly influenced our attitudes towards\nour children, it does not follow that this is the complete explanation\nfor why we believe we have special obligations to care for our\nchildren and for why we behave as we do toward them. It may be\npart of the explanation, while another part may have to do\nwith an autonomous recognition of the appropriateness of\nspecial parental care: we see that we have good reasons to\ntake special care of our children, which ought to motivate us\neven if we weren\u2019t already motivated by instinctive feelings. We\nmight also employ autonomous, domain-general comprehensive moral\nreasoning to recognize that our instinctive feelings shouldn\u2019t\nalways be followed, e.g., in cases where considerations of justice\nconstrain certain pursuits of benefits for one\u2019s own children,\nproviding genuine overriding reasons to refrain from unjust actions.\n(We will consider another plausible example of overdetermination\ninvolving judgments about the much discussed \u2018Trolley\ncases\u2019 in section 3.)\n2.5 The Challenge to the Autonomous Reflection Model: Post Hoc Rationalization of Emotionally Caused Judgment\n\nAdvocates of an autonomous reflection model of moral judgment grant\nthat various causal influences\u2014likely including evolutionary\nones\u2014often play some role in moral thought and feeling.\nBut opponents who hold a deflationary view of the role of autonomous\nreflection seek to press the challenge here more fully. To expand the\npotential reach of the evolutionary influence model of moral judgment,\nthey typically combine that causal model with what may be called the\n\u2018mere rationalization hypothesis\u2019 with regard to the\nreasons people give for moral judgments that are really\nshaped by evolutionary factors.\n\nOn this view, our giving of reasons for our moral beliefs in\nsuch cases is interpreted as mere post hoc rationalization.\nRather than engaging in autonomous reflection and reasoning, and\ncoming to believe certain moral propositions for the reasons that\nemerge from that reflection (as with M, P and S), what is happening\ninstead according to this hypothesis is that (1) our moral beliefs are\nsimply caused by emotions or \u2018moral\ninstincts\u2019 we have largely due to our evolutionary background,\nand (2) we then invent rationalizations for these resulting\nbeliefs in order to try to make sense of them to ourselves, unaware of\ntheir real causal origins (Haidt 2001; Wheatley and Haidt 2005; Knobe\nand Leiter 2007; Leiter 2007).\n\nFor example, when someone judges that abortion is wrong, it may be\nthat \u201cthe anti-abortion judgment (a gut feeling that abortion is\nbad) causes the belief that life begins at conception (an ex post\nfacto rationalization of the gut feeling)\u201d (Haidt 2001,\n817). On this model, our moral reasonings and justifications (or at\nleast those to which the model is supposed to apply) are just so much\nwindow dressing for beliefs that are more like post-hypnotic\nsuggestions than they are like M, P or S; just as with post-hypnotic\nsuggestions, people go to great lengths to provide rationalizations in\nan attempt to render their moral beliefs intelligible to themselves.\nThe difference is that instead of a hypnotist, the causal agents are\nemotional dispositions stemming from our evolutionary past.\n\nThe basic idea that some moral beliefs are susceptible to\nthis sort of debunking explanation is not new. Moral philosophers have\nlong recognized that people have often been led to moral judgments\nbased on self-interest or prejudice, for example, and then\nrationalized their views, inventing justifications for positions held\ndue to other causes. A plausible example would be a judgment such\nas:\n\nMJ2: Interracial marriage is morally wrong.\n\n\nWhile such a judgment was not uncommon just a few generations ago,\nmost readers of this article will recognize MJ2 to be not only false,\nbut also likely to have stemmed from racial prejudice, with much of\nwhat was said to justify it being mere post hoc\nrationalization for a view more attributable to the causal influence\nof prejudice than to the workings of autonomous reflection and\nreasononing. Most philosophers today would say something similar about\na moral belief still held by many people, especially within\ntraditional religions:\n\nMJ3: Homosexuality is morally wrong.\n\n\nThe reason why philosophers tend to find a \u2018mere rationalization\nhypothesis\u2019 plausible for such beliefs as MJ2 and MJ3 is that\n(i) the justifications offered for them have consistently failed to\nstand up to critical reflection, and (ii) there are plausible\nalternative explanations for why people have really come to hold such\nbeliefs, such as that they have misconstrued personal feelings of\ndisgust as perceptions of objective moral wrongness, and projected\nthose feelings onto the world as \u2018moral\n impurity\u2019.[7]\n Together, these considerations lend support to the hypothesis that\nthe justifications offered are mere rationalizations, and that the\nbeliefs are best explained by appeal to emotional causes.\n\nThe central question is: How broadly does the deflationary model of\nthe \u2018mere rationalization hypothesis\u2019 apply to moral\njudgments, and to what extent are evolutionary influences implicated\nin those cases?\n\nAt one extreme, someone might deny that the autonomy assumption\napplies to the moral domain at all: we either lack these capacities in\nthe domain of moral thought, or at least never exercise them. Such a\nclaim seems to have little plausibility, however. Why should it be\nthat human intelligence and innovation know virtually no bounds in\nother domains\u2014as illustrated by feats of autonomous inquiry and\ncreativity in quantum field theory, algebraic topology, modal\nmetaphysics, or symphonic composition\u2014and yet when it comes to\nmoral thinking we remain stuck in ruts carved out for us by evolution,\nslavishly following patterns of thought prescribed for us by evolved,\ndomain-specific mechanisms, with all of our cultural developments\nproviding mere variations on those themes?\n\nThe very fact of human self-consciousness makes such a picture\nunlikely: for as soon as we are told that our thinking is constrained\nalong evolutionarily given paths, our very awareness of those\ninfluences provides the opening to imagine and to pursue new\npossibilities. If you are told, for example, that you are\nevolutionarily conditioned to favor your group heavily over outsiders\nin your moral judgments, you are able, as a reflective agent, to take\nthis very fact into account in your subsequent moral reflection,\ndeciding that this favoring is unwarranted and thus coming to a new,\nmore egalitarian moral\n view.[8]\n Analogously, it may be true that we possess dedicated mechanisms for\n\u2018reading\u2019 faces as trustworthy or threatening, and often\nmake split-second judgments on this basis; but this doesn\u2019t\npreclude our ability to revise such judgments, as when we reflect on\nthe behavior of someone with \u2018trustworthy facial features\u2019\nand realize that he is actually a scoundrel.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the leading proponent of the mere\nrationalization hypothesis, Jonathan Haidt (2001), does not\ntake the extreme position of denying the autonomy assumption. He\ngrants that such capacities exist and are sometimes exercised,\nsingling out the moral deliberations of philosophers as likely\nexamples (2001, 828\u201329). His claim is just that such exercise of\nautonomous reasoning in the production of moral judgment is rare; in\nthe vast majority of cases, our judgments result from immediate\n\u2018intuitions\u2019 reflecting emotional causation. But there are\nmany questions to raise even about this qualified claim (despite its\ngenerously letting philosophers, at least, off the hook).\n\nEven where our judgments are based on immediate\n\u2018intuitions\u2019, it may be that these intuitions are often\nthemselves informed by prior acts of reflection and\nreasoning (Pizarro and Bloom 2003), or are partly cognitive responses\nto objective features of situations that may outrun our ability (prior\nto philosophical reflection) to articulate them\u2014much as a chess\nmaster may \u2018see\u2019 that a certain move is best prior to\nbeing able to articulate exactly why (Kamm 1996, 2007). Similarly, the\ninput from the autonomous reasoning of philosophers and some religious\nleaders may well influence the background ethical sensibilities of\nwhole societies, thus influencing moral judgment even where there is\nno lengthy reasoning occurring in the particular case. There are also\nimportant philosophical worries about the methodologies by which Haidt\ncomes to his deflationary conclusions about the role played by\nreasoning in ordinary people\u2019s moral judgments.\n\nTo take just one example, Haidt cites a study where people made\nnegative moral judgments in response to \u201cactions that were\noffensive yet harmless, such as\u2026cleaning one\u2019s toilet with\nthe national flag.\u201d People had negative emotional reactions to\nthese things and judged them to be wrong, despite the fact that they\ndid not cause any harms to anyone; that is, \u201caffective reactions\nwere good predictors of judgment, whereas perceptions of harmfulness\nwere not\u201d (Haidt 2001, 817). He takes this to support the\nconclusion that people\u2019s moral judgments in these cases are based\non gut feelings and merely rationalized, since the actions, being\nharmless, don\u2019t actually warrant such negative moral judgments.\nBut such a conclusion would be supported only if all the subjects in\nthe experiment were consequentialists, specifically believing\nthat only harmful consequences are relevant to moral\nwrongness. If they are not, and believe\u2014perhaps quite rightly\n(though it doesn\u2019t matter for the present point what the truth is\nhere)\u2014that there are other factors that can make an\naction wrong, then their judgments may be perfectly appropriate\ndespite the lack of harmful consequences.\n\nThis is in fact entirely plausible in the cases studied: most people\nthink that it is inherently disrespectful, and hence wrong,\nto clean a toilet with their nation\u2019s flag, quite apart from the\nfact that it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone; so the fact that their moral\njudgment lines up with their emotions but not with a belief that there\nwill be harmful consequences does not show (or even suggest) that the\nmoral judgment is merely caused by emotions or gut reactions. Nor is\nit surprising that people have trouble articulating their reasons when\nthey find an action intrinsically inappropriate, as by being\ndisrespectful (as opposed to being instrumentally bad, which is much\neasier to explain).\n\nTo return to our central question: it remains unclear just how much of\nhuman moral judgment is susceptible to the mere rationalization\nhypothesis, or when it is, how much of a role is played by\nevolutionary influences on emotions. The mere rationalization\nhypothesis is best supported when we have independent reason to reject\nan appeal to autonomous reflection, as when a moral judgment is\nimplausible in itself and we have a very likely debunking causal\nexplanation of why someone might nonetheless be led to believe such a\nthing. Such is the case with MJ2 and MJ3 above, and perhaps many other\ntraditional moral judgments focused on sexual taboos, notions of\n\u2018impurity\u2019, in-group loyalty (from tribalism to\nnationalism), hierarchical authority relations, and rigid gender\nroles. But this does not provide grounds for a deflationary\napproach across the board.\n\nMany moral beliefs\u2014for example, concerning the moral irrelevance\nof sexual preference, the moral equality of persons of all races and\nnationalities, or moral obligations even to future generations in far\naway countries\u2014are much more plausible candidates for being\nupshots of autonomous moral reflection and reasoning. Indeed, many\nphilosophers take them to be plausible candidates for moral\ntruths, grasped through reflection that reveals good\nreasons for believing them, which is therefore what explains our\nmoral beliefs and behavior in these cases.\n\nThese claims may, of course, be disputed. Even if it is granted that\nour judgments are often the products of our reasoning, pace\nHaidt (2001), it remains possible that our reasoning itself is\ndistorted by evolutionary influences. This may be especially worrisome\ngiven the role played by intuitions in moral reasoning\n(unlike with mathematical reasoning, say), even in determining our\nacceptance of premises in arguments: insofar as there are concerns\nthat our intuitions may be distorted by evolutionary influences, there\nwill equally be worries about our moral reasoning (Sinnott-Armstrong\n2005).\n\nIt remains unclear, however, just how far such worries really extend,\neven if it is granted that moral intuition and reasoning are often\nsubject to such distorting influence. It is hard to see, for example,\nhow some people\u2019s moral belief that we should impoverish ourselves\nand limit our own reproduction in order to help distant strangers, or\neven that we should cease having children altogether, could be\nexplained in terms of the distortion of their reasoning by\nevolutionary influences. The striking range of moral beliefs itself,\nboth across and within cultures, seems like good evidence of\nsignificant input from autonomous moral reflection\u2014moral thought\ngoing beyond exercises of evolved \u201cneurocomputational\nsystems\u201d or \u201csocial contract algorithms\u201d or\n\u201cinference engines\u201d with domain-specific goals and special\ninference procedures designed for solving particular adaptive problems\n(Cosmides and Tooby 2008). Even if there are indeed such special\nmodules devoted to reasoning about obligation and entitlement, as\nposited by evolutionary psychologists, the question is how much they\nexplain, and whether they really exclude significant input from\nautonomous moral reasoning.\n\nThese issues remain challenging and controversial. But the\ncontroversies are as much ongoing philosophical ones as\nscientific ones, and it is therefore unlikely that scientific results\nwill settle them. Science will plainly not settle, for example,\nwhether or not there are moral truths; and if there are, they will\nlikely play an explanatory role with regard to at least some of our\nmoral beliefs\u2014something we will miss if we approach these issues\nfrom an exclusively scientific point of view.\n\nA duly cautious claim about the explanatory role of evolution with\nrespect to morality in the empirical sense might therefore be:\n\nThe Modest Evolutionary Explanatory Thesis: evolutionary\nforces may adequately explain certain capacities and\ntendencies associated with moral thinking, feeling and\nbehavior, and may explain or partially explain some\nof the content of our moral thought, feeling and behavior,\ninsofar as it is influenced (individually or via influences on\ncultural development) by those tendencies.\n\n3. Evolutionary Biology and Normative Ethics: Prescriptive Evolutionary Ethics, Corrective Evolutionary Ethics, and the Question of Moral Progress\n\nIn section 1.2, we distinguished between the empirical and normative\nsenses of \u2018morality\u2019. This section deals with morality\nin the normative sense. Does evolutionary biology shed light on\nthe content of morality in the normative sense? That is, in thinking\nabout how we ought to live, do we get any insight from evolutionary\ntheory? And does evolutionary biology have any significant\nimplications for thinking about the prospects for moral progress?\n3.1 Spencer\n\nThe project of attempting to derive normative conclusions from the\nfacts of evolutionary biology is most commonly associated with Herbert\nSpencer and his \u201cSocial Darwinist\u201d admirers. Spencer was,\nby all accounts, a more gifted and subtle thinker than he is typically\ngiven credit for today. (See the entry on\n Spencer.)\n Still, we may treat his views briefly here, as his arguments\nconcerning evolutionary biology and ethics were based on deep\nmisunderstandings of evolution. This is not to deny the historical\ninterest of his views. It may be surprising to learn, for example,\nthat Spencer himself gave a central place to harmony and mutual\naid in the \u201cpermanently peaceful societies\u201d he viewed\nas the pinnacle of evolution in its \u201chighest\nphase\u201d\u2014something one does not typically associate with\n\u201cSocial Darwinism\u201d, but which comes directly from\nSpencer\u2019s (largely non-Darwinian) conception of evolution.\n\nSpencer (1879) conceived of evolution as a teleological process,\ndirected toward the production of progressively \u201cmore\nevolved\u201d (in the sense of \u201csuperior\u201d) forms\nmanifesting a greater \u201ctotality of life\u201d, i.e., a greater\nrichness of thought, feeling and action, as well as greater length of\nlife. Human behavior is \u201cmore evolved\u201d than the behavior\nof other animals, and the harmonious and mutually supportive behavior\nof people in \u201cpermanently peaceful societies\u201d (where\n\u201cself-maintenance and race-maintenance\u201d is pursued without\nhindering others in the same pursuit) is \u201cmore evolved\u201d\nthan the behavior of savages or of members of less harmonious\nsocieties; that is, the former is the \u201chighest form of\nconduct\u201d because it subserves the greatest \u201ctotality of\nlife\u201d embodied by harmonious and happy human social life, where\nthe latter is taken to be the final end of evolution.\n\nAll of this, of course, is inconsistent with Darwinism, which denies\nthat evolution is a teleological or end-directed process, gives no\nmeaning to Spencer\u2019s notions of \u201cmore evolved\u201d forms\nor conduct (whereby human beings, for example, are \u201cmore\nevolved\u201d than other species, or ethical conduct is \u201cmore\nevolved\u201d than unethical conduct), and focuses on reproductive\nfitness rather than on Spencer\u2019s notion of the \u201cgreatest\ntotality of life in self, in offspring and in fellow man,\u201d among\nother fundamental differences (Rachels 1990). Spencer\u2019s views on\nmorality and evolution may therefore be set aside as historically\ninteresting but unhelpful to contemporary discussions based on a\nbetter understanding of evolutionary biology.\n3.2 Biology and the Autonomy of Ethics\n\nEven philosophers sympathetic to\n ethical naturalism\n (the view that moral facts are themselves natural facts of some sort)\nhave typically been wary of attempts to derive conclusions about\nmorality in the normative sense from facts about evolutionary\nhistory. This is especially so when they are clear (unlike Spencer)\nabout the principles governing Darwinian evolution through natural\nselection. From the fact that a certain trait is an adaptation, which\nevolved through natural selection by virtue of its positive feedback\neffects on germ-line replication of the alleles that generate the\ntrait, nothing at all seems to follow about whether it is morally good\nor right, or something we ought to embrace and foster. Certain\ndispositions may be present in us for good evolutionary reasons\nwithout any implication that these traits benefit us, or are moral\nvirtues or produce behaviors that are morally right.\n\nA brief survey of some of the traits that are likely biological\nadaptations in a number of species\u2014such as a tendency to kill\n\u2018step-children\u2019 or to philander\u2014ought to convince us\nthat even if similar tendencies are likewise adaptations in human\nbeings, present in us for similar evolutionary reasons, this would be\nno argument at all that we ought to engage in such behaviors.\nClearly the burden would be on the prescriptive evolutionary ethicist\nto explain why a trait\u2019s having been good at propagating the\nalleles coding for it tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago\nshould be thought to have anything at all with the rational or\nmoral justification of our embracing it. And the\nprospects for meeting this burden have never seemed strong: it is hard\nto see how such evolutionary facts can possibly have normative\nauthority or force for a rational agent (McDowell 1995).\nRegardless of why one has a given trait, the question for a rational\nagent is always: is it right for me to exercise it, or should I\ninstead renounce and resist it as far as I am able? (Korsgaard\n 2006).[9]\n\nThis suggests that ethics, like mathematics, is an autonomous\nsubject in the sense that it has its own \u201cinternal standards of\njustification and criticism\u201d, such that its conclusions cannot\nbe justified by other forms of inquiry such as evolutionary biology\n(Nagel 1979, 142; McDowell 1995 and 1997a,b). Normative ethical\nconclusions are justified through first-order ethical reflection and\nargument, just as mathematical propositions are justified through\nmathematical reasoning, rather than through learning more about our\nevolutionary past or about what is happening in our brains when we\nengage in these forms of reasoning (Rachels, 1990). It would seem to\nbe as much of a mistake to try to answer ethical questions by\nexamining fMRI scans or studying our evolutionary history as it would\nbe to try to solve mathematical problems by such means (except,\nperhaps, insofar as evolutionary theory may shed light on some\npresent, morally relevant empirical facts, as discussed below).\n\nStill, some have argued that empirical psychological studies (and\nrelated evolutionary hypotheses\u2014see section 4.2) can have\nnormative ethical implications. In particular, it has recently been\nargued that scientific evidence supports consequentialist\nethical theories over deontological ones (Greene 2003, 2008, Singer\n2005). Consider a famous pair of hypothetical cases much discussed by\nmoral philosophers (Thomson 1985):\n\n\nTrolley: a runaway trolley is heading toward five people on\nthe track ahead, who cannot get out of the way; it cannot be stopped,\nbut there is a switch you could flip that would divert it onto a side\ntrack containing only one person;\n\nBridge: a runaway trolley is heading toward five people on\nthe track ahead, who cannot get out of the way; you are standing on a\nbridge over the track, and if you shove the very large person next to\nyou off the bridge and in front of the trolley, the crushing of his\nbody will stop the trolley before it reaches the five.\n\n\nMost people respond to these cases by saying that Trolley is\npermissible while Bridge is not. But what explains this difference in\nmoral response? Many philosophers have argued for deontological\nconstraints prohibiting murdering some to save others, as in Bridge;\nthey regard the case of diverting a public threat toward lesser harm,\nas in Trolley, as an exception, and offer principled reasons for doing\nso, thus justifying our treating the two cases differently (e.g.,\nThomson 1985). Greene (2008, 42\u201344) dismisses such normative\nexplanations as unconvincing and takes a very different tack,\nhighlighting another difference between Trolley and Bridge: whereas\nthe harm done in Bridge (shoving a man to his death) is \u201cup\nclose and personal\u201d, the harm done in Trolley (by flipping a\nswitch) is not. This difference corresponds to a difference in the\nstrength of emotional response, the response to \u201cpersonal\u201d\nharm being much stronger; and this in turn corresponds to a difference\nin the brain regions most active when the cases are contemplated:\nBridge tends to activate areas associated with social/emotional\nprocessing (the posterior cingulate cortex, the medial prefrontal\ncortex, and the amygdala) while Trolley produces activity in areas\nassociated with higher cognition (the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nand the inferior parietal lobe).\n\nGreene takes this to support the hypothesis that what accounts for\npeople\u2019s different moral responses to Trolley and Bridge (and\ncountless other cases) is simply the difference in emotional response,\nwhich in turn ties in to evolutionary explanations. Given the need in\nour evolutionary past for mechanisms to restrain interpersonal\nviolence within cooperating groups, \u201cit should come as no\nsurprise if we have innate responses to personal violence that are\npowerful but rather primitive,\u201d predating the evolution of\ncomplex reasoning and now competing with our more reasoned responses\n(Greene 2008, 43). Deontological intuitions, such as our condemnation\nof the violence in Bridge, thus represent evolved \u201calarm-like\nemotional responses\u201d which are subsequently\nrationalized rather than resulting from moral reasoning (see\nthe discussion of Haidt in section 2.5); by contrast, our responses to\nmore abstract harm such as Trolley reflect complex cognitive\nprocesses, as do consequentialist responses generally, including cases\nwhere people overcome their initial negative emotional responses (in\ncases like Bridge) and decide that the right thing to do is whatever\nproduces the best overall consequences.\n\nGreene\u2019s claim, then, is that this casts doubt on deontological\nethical theory: far from giving us good reasons to refrain from\ncertain utility maximizing acts, it merely gives expression to\nemotional relics of our evolutionary history. A rational morality will\nmove beyond such alarm-like emotions and take us, through genuine\nreasoning, in the direction of consequentialism.\n\nAs with Haidt\u2019s claims about moral judgment (section 2.5), there\nare many philosophical questions to raise about such appeals to\nexperimental data to draw philosophically loaded conclusions (Appiah\n2008, Berker 2009, Dancy 2014, Railton 2014, FitzPatrick 2018). It is\nhardly surprising, after all, that people have strong emotional\nreactions to blatant rights violations such as shoving an innocent\nperson off a bridge in front of a trolley to be crushed for the\ngreater good. Such emotions would equally be expected on deontological\nmodels. Nor does the speed with which we make negative moral judgments\nin such cases show that the judgments are merely emotion-driven: even\nif there is not explicit reasoning going on in each case, the\nemotion-laden intuitive responses may be informed by background moral\nreflection and formation (Pizarro and Bloom 2003, Dancy 2014, Railton\n2014). Philosophers who are less skeptical of the normative\nexplanations for our judgments will find it plausible that such\nreflection has made us intuitively sensitive to morally relevant\ndistinctions\u2014such as the distinction between doing something to\na public threat to direct it toward least harm vs. assaulting an\ninnocent person and using his harm to bring about less overall harm;\nthat sensitivity then shows up in our intuitive moral judgments, which\nare no less justified just because they provoke strong emotions.\n\nIndeed, philosophers who believe there are good reasons for\ndistinguishing morally between Trolley and Bridge are unlikely to be\nconvinced by the above debunking explanation, for the following\nreason. Suppose we vary Bridge to equalize the cases for the factor\nGreene emphasizes: instead of having to shove the man off the bridge,\nall you have to do in Bridge Lever is flip a switch, and the switch\nwill activate a lever that knocks the bystander off the bridge in\nfront of the trolley. These cases are now equalized to be\n\u201cimpersonal\u201d: neither now involves violence that is\n\u201cup close and personal\u201d. But does this variation change\nour moral response? If it does not, and we find Bridge Lever again\nobjectionable (just like Bridge) while allowing for Trolley, then\nGreene\u2019s proposed explanation would not work: we would need a\ndifferent explanation for this pair of cases, such as the\nreason-giving explanation deontological philosophers would give. Even\nwith regard to the original pair of cases, while Greene may be right\nthat evolved dispositions against personal violence play some\nrole in explaining our reactions, this needn\u2019t be the whole\nexplanation. It may be that this is another case of\noverdetermination (see section 2.4).\n3.3 Corrective Uses of Evolutionary Biology in Normative Ethics\n\nA less problematic kind of appeal to evolutionary theory has been made\neven by those who fully recognize the autonomy of ethics and the role\nof autonomous moral reflection. Darwinian evolutionary theory implies\nthat many other beliefs about the natures and origins of living things\nare false. Human beings are not members of a species created by a\nspecial act of a divine designer, but members of an evolved species\nrelated by common ancestry to every other species on Earth. So insofar\nas certain ethical views rely on assumptions about special\ncreation, they will be refuted by the success of evolutionary theory.\nMore weakly, insofar as certain ethical views have traditionally been\nsupported by claims about special creation, they will to that\nextent lose some of their support. This would not show that they are\nfalse or even unjustified, as there may be alternative sufficient\nsupport for them. But in removing some of their common support,\nevolutionary theory would pose a significant challenge to those who\nhad relied on that support (Rachels 1990).\n\nRachels takes such an approach against the common belief that human\nbeings have a special moral dignity that is much higher than the\nstatus enjoyed by non-human animals. Such a belief has traditionally\nbeen rooted in the idea that we are separate from other living things,\nhaving been created specially in the image of God and endowed with\nsouls, giving us a special moral status. If evolutionary theory is\ntrue, however, then this support is undermined: since Homo\nsapiens evolved from other species, there is no sharp biological\nseparation between Homo sapiens and the rest of the living\nworld; there is instead a continuum through evolutionary history, with\nno species created separately, in a divine image, or infused with\nspecial souls. Thus, those who have based their beliefs about the\nspeical moral status of human beings on a creationist picture have a\nproblem: that picture is false, and the true picture does nothing to\nsupport such a view.\n\nAgain, however, this does not show that the common view of special\nhuman dignity is false or even unjustified. There may be other forms\nof support for it that do not depend on creationist assumptions. Many\nwould argue, for example, that although we are related to other\nanimals, we are very different from even our closest primate\nrelatives, as (not to put too fine a point on it) a trip to the zoo\nfollowed by a visit to the Library of Congress or the Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art will confirm. The vastness of the differences between\nhuman and other forms of life on Earth is not erased by pointing out\nthat human beings got to be the way we are through contingent\nevolutionary processes acting on brains similar to those of extant\napes, together with thousands of years of cultural evolution. It is\nthese real differences\u2014regardless of how they came\nabout\u2014that plausibly ground differences in the moral status of\nhuman beings and other\n animals.[10]\n\nThere are more straightforward ways in which evolutionary biology, as\nwell as results from empirical moral psychology, can play a corrective\nrole in normative ethics. Evolutionary biology and comparative\ngenetics might, for example, be used to undermine false claims about\nrace, which underlie racist ethical claims. Experimental psychology\nmight be used to cast doubts on the moral condemnation of\nhomosexuality by supporting the debunking hypothesis that such\njudgments stem from projected disgust. More generally, psychological\nexperiments can expose typical human pitfalls in moral judgment and\nbehavior\u2014tendencies toward cruelty in conditions of power\ninequality, or toward exaggerated moral condemnation when experiencing\ndisgust or stress. If we understand these facts about ourselves, we\ncan more effectively pursue and realize normative goals such as\nnon-violence or fairness by avoiding circumstances that lead to\ncruelty, or by watching for and correcting distorting influences on\nour judgment (Glover 2000; Appiah 2008, 49, 71\u201372, 110\u201311,\n124; Buchanan and Powell 2018). As noted earlier, however, the\nnormative goals themselves will not have been set for us by\nevolutionary biology or psychology. That task falls to informed moral\nreflection.\n3.4 The Question of Moral Progress\n\nThe idea of moral progress features prominently in reflection on the\nhistory and future of moral thought and practice. While it may be\ndifficult to assess whether a society has made moral progress on\nthe whole over some period, it is not hard to find plausible\nexamples of progress along particular dimensions. The elimination of\nthe Atlantic slave trade, for example, and the development of the\nmodern human rights movement are compelling examples of widespread\nmoral progress. There are also plausible avenues to further\nprogress through improved conformity with legitimate moral norms\nand through improvements in moral concepts, reasoning, and\nunderstanding. We might then wonder: what are the drivers of such\nmoral progress (and likewise of moral regression when it occurs)? And\nhow might evolutionary biology bear on the prospects and strategies\nfor achieving moral progress (and avoiding moral regression)? Allen\nBuchanan and Russell Powell take up these issues in wide-ranging\ntheoretical work that potentially has practical implications for a\nnumber of current social and political problems, as discussed below\n(Buchanan and Powell 2018, 2019; Buchanan 2020; see also the symposium\ndiscussion of the 2018 book in Analyse & Kritik 41(2),\n2019).\n\nDifferent metaethical stances (see section 4) yield different\nunderstandings of what moral progress might consist in as well as\ndifferent explanations for how moral progress has historically come\nabout. A moral realist, for example, will tend to conceive of moral\nprogress in terms of achieving a more accurate grasp of objective\nmoral truths and refining of our practices and institutions to align\nmore closely with them; and plausible examples, such as the widespread\nliberalization of moral practices over the past few centuries, will be\nexplained largely by appeal to growing insight into moral truth\n(Huemer 2016). By contrast, those who reject such appeals to objective\nmoral truths but wish to retain some notion of moral progress (perhaps\none that is extensionally very similar) will formulate a different\nconception of progress and offer socio-cultural explanations of\nprogressive changes that do not rely on appeals to improved insights\ninto moral truth (Kitcher 2011). We will here set aside the many\ncomplex issues attending these different approaches and focus on\nthis question: what bearing might our evolutionary past have on our\nprospects and strategies for achieving the sorts of changes most agree\nwould constitute moral progress?\n\nSuppose that the trend toward greater inclusivity with respect to the\nscope of moral consideration\u2014i.e., the elimination of racial and\ngender barriers to the attribution of full human moral status, and the\nextension of substantial moral considerability to a wide range of\nnon-human animals\u2014counts as moral progress. One pessimistic\nthought that might arise here on the basis of evolutionary\nconsiderations is that human moral psychology may have evolved in such\na way as to place inevitable constraints on the possibilities for\nachieving robust and sustained progress in these respects. While our\nevolved moral psychology may contain certain altruistic elements,\nthese may be ultimately parochial, given the nature of the selection\npressures faced by our Pleistocene ancestors and assuming, as most\ndiscussions do, that the long Pleistocene Epoch (roughly 2.6 million\nyears ago to 11,700 years ago, is the one primarily relevant to the\nbiological evolution of human psychological\n traits).[11]\n That is, these elements may be focused on kin and members of a\nperceived in-group, with other countervailing dispositions posing\nstrong obstacles to extending that altruism to outside groups. Even if\nwe have some capacity for autonomous moral thought, enabling at least\nsome to grasp more inclusive moral truths, there may be such powerful\nevolutionary constraints built into human moral psychology that such\nideas are unlikely to take hold and motivate progressive changes in a\nwidespread and sustainable way. There may be evolutionary limits to\nthe basic moral progress that we evolved primates can realistically\nhope to achieve: we may just be saddled with a largely\nexclusivist, tribalist morality.\n\nBuchanan and Powell refer to this pessimistic idea as\n\u201cevoconservatism,\u201d and they note that it has been used\nto argue against social and political movements organized around such\n\u201ccosmopolitan moral reform.\u201d And on the other side of\nthat same evolutionary coin, \u201cevoliberals\u201d share the same\npremise about the constraints imposed by evolution on human moral\npsychology but instead argue that since the progressive goals are\nsufficiently desirable, we should look for biotechnological\ninterventions to alter human nature in such a way as to make them\nrealistically achievable. Buchanan and Powell reject both views\nbecause they reject the underlying picture of evolved human moral\nnature. Instead, they argue that the striking shifts that have already\noccurred toward more inclusive morality, as well as consideration of\nthe conditions under which moral regression has occurred, support a\nvery different, more nuanced picture of evolved human moral\npsychology\u2014one without such pessimistic implications for deep\nand lasting moral progress.\n\nOn their \u201cbiocultural\u201d view, it is not just that human\nrationality allows significant scope for autonomous moral reasoning\nthat can lead to greater inclusivity (as discussed in section 2.4\nabove), but that our evolved moral psychology itself contains the\nseeds for such a shift (though it equally contains the seeds for\npotential moral regression). They key idea is that our evolved moral\nnature is neither inherently tribalist nor inherently inclusivist, but\ncontains both dispositions; their expression, however,\nis conditional on the particular socio-institutional environmental\nconditions that obtain (or are at least perceived to obtain). In some\nconditions tribalistic dispositions will be engaged, while in other\nconditions inclusivist dispositions can dominate. This is their\n\u201cadaptive plasticity\u201d model of evolved human moral\npsychology, according to which evolution has disposed us to think and\nbehave in certain ways under one set of (perceived) conditions, and in\nvery different ways under another set of (perceived)\nconditions\u2014this having been fitness-enhancing in our\nevolutionary history. In particular, our tribalist tendencies are\nactivated when \u201ccues of out-group threat\u201d are perceived\n(whether real or not), involving competition, disease, undermining of\nin-group cohesion, and so on; by contrast, our inclusivist tendencies\nare activated when such cues are less abundant or salient.\n\nThe hypothesis is that these adaptively plastic traits served the\nbiological interests of Pleiostocene humans well, achieving the joint\nbenefits of tribalism under conditions where it was fitness-enhancing\nand more inclusive morality under conditions where tribalism was\ncounterproductive and greater inclusivity was beneficial. For us\ntoday, this constitutes a mixed inheritance: on the one hand, it\nprovides us with the seeds for moral progress insofar as we can foster\nand maintain the socio-institutional contexts that allow more\ninclusive dispositions to flourish; on the other hand, it saddles us\nwith vulnerability to destructive tribalism when we find ourselves (or\neven just perceive ourselves to be) in circumstances\ncharacterized by sufficient out-group threat cues. Buchanan and Powell\nargue that this makes human beings dangerously susceptible to moral\nregression due to the manipulation of perceptions through demagogic\npopulism, for example\u2014a danger that is exacerbated where\ndisinformation is rapidly spread through social media. If they are\nright, then the situation is ripe for media-savvy politicians to\nmanipulate popular beliefs in ways designed to trigger the threat cues\nthat energize tribalist tendencies in thought, feeling and behavior\nfor political gain\u2014from reflexive anti-immigrant nationalist\nsentiment to racially charged scapegoating during a pandemic.\n\nWhile these dangers cast doubt on the conviction that moral\nprogress is inevitable or even the natural default, the model proposed\nby Buchanan and Powell leaves open a realistic hope for continued and\ndeepening moral progress: it is possible for humanity to make and\nsustain deep moral progress, without being hamstrung by any inbuilt\nevolutionary constraints; but it will require ongoing cultural efforts\nto foster and sustain the socio-institutional circumstances that\nenable the better aspects of human moral nature to predominate\n(Buchanan, forthcoming). This is the practical message of this\nbiocultural theory of moral progress: moral progress is possible for\nus without the need for biotechnological modifications of human\nnature; but such progress is also fragile and cannot be taken for\ngranted (Buchanan and Powell 2018).\n4. Evolutionary Metaethics\n\nWhile evolutionary facts may do little to illuminate the\ncontent of morality in the normative sense (apart from\nshedding light on morally relevant facts), they are sometimes thought\nto tell us something about the existence and nature\nof morality in the normative sense. (See section 1.2 for the notion of\nmorality in the normative sense.) A number of philosophers have\nclaimed that evolutionary theory can be used to debunk certain\nmetaethical theories and perhaps to support others. One\nrelatively modest project along these lines would be to use\nevolutionary biology to undermine Aristotelian appeals to natural\nteleology in human life to account for ethical facts, along the lines\nof Foot (2001). This evolutionary-based critique of\n\u201cteleological naturalism\u201d in ethics (FitzPatrick 2000) is\ndiscussed in the\n\nSupplement on Natural Teleology in Ethics.\n \n\nOther projects involve using evolutionary biology to try to undermine\ntraditional\n moral realism\u2014the\n view that moral judgments can be true (accurately representing moral\nfacts) when construed literally, that their truth does not depend on\nour evaluative attitudes, and that we can know at least some of these\ntruths. Such arguments are taken to support moral skepticism\n(according to which we cannot possess moral knowledge) or\n moral antirealism\n (for example, views that construe moral truths as functions of our\nevaluative attitudes, or expressivist views according to which moral\njudgments function to express attitudes, acceptance of norms, etc.,\nrather than to represent moral facts, or error theoretic views\naccording to which all moral judgments are false).\n4.1 General Evolutionary Debunking Arguments\n\nAs discussed in section 2, evolutionary accounts of the origins of our\ncapacity to be guided by moral judgments do not require any appeal to\nthe comprehension of moral truths by our hominin ancestors,\nor even to the existence of such truths. Such stories require only\nclaims about natural selection pressures having favored the\ndevelopment of such a capacity and tendency because of the positive\neffects such traits had on biological fitness (Kitcher 2006a, 176, and\n2011; Joyce 2006, 131, 184; Street 2006, 127 f.; Griffiths and Wilkins\n2015). Should this fact undermine our confidence in the existence of\nmoral truth or in the possibility of moral knowledge (at least if\nmoral truths are understood to be objective, i.e., independent of our\nevaluative attitudes)?\n\nProponents of epistemic \u2018evolutionary debunking arguments\u2019\nthink it should, arguing either that evolutionary considerations\nsupport moral skepticism (Joyce 2006, 2013, Forthcoming) or that they\nat least undermine traditional moral realism by providing a defeater\nfor our moral beliefs if correctness for moral beliefs is\nconstrued in a realist fashion as accurate representation of objective\nor independent moral truths (Street 2006, 2008). (For discussion of\nthese arguments, see Copp 2008, Kahane 2011, Enoch 2011, Skarsaune\n2011, Shafer-Landau 2012, Berker 2014, Fraser 2014, FitzPatrick\n2014a,b and 2017a,b, Vavova 2015, Rini 2016, Levi and Levi 2020, among\nmany others.)\n\nOn the face of it, the mere fact that natural selection would not have\n\u2018designed\u2019 our moral faculties to track moral truths\naccurately (as it plausibly designed our perceptual faculties to track\nfacts about medium sized objects in typical human environments) is not\nobviously problematic. There are, after all, lots of cases where we\nseem to be able to grasp genuine truths even though those truths play\nno role in the story of how our basic mental capacities evolved. We\nare able to grasp truths of quantum field theory or higher dimensional\ntopology or, for that matter, philosophy (or so we are assuming in\neven engaging in this debate) even though those truths had nothing to\ndo with why the basic mental capacities underlying these abilities\nevolved in our Pleistocene ancestors. Those capacities evolved in\nresponse to selection pressures in ancestral hunter-gatherer\nenvironments, and we have simply learned how to develop, train and\nexercise them in cultural contexts to discover truths that go far\nbeyond any that were relevant to the evolution of those underlying\ncapacities. Philosophers who endorse some form of moral realism have\ntypically believed that we\u2019ve done the same thing in grasping\nmoral truths (see sections 2.4\u20132.5).\n\nSuppose, however, that evolutionary influences not only did not design\nour faculties to track moral truths, but did positively shape\nthem in ways that have pervasively conditioned the content of\nour moral thought and feeling, through evolved emotional dispositions\nor \u201cdomain specific modules\u201d that provide us with\ninherited moral instincts that shape our beliefs. Debunkers have\nclaimed that this is the case and argued that it has deep metaethical\nimplications. Though there are a variety of formulations of such\narguments, with somewhat different targets (some attacking moral\nknowledge itself, others seeking only to undermine moral realism by\nshowing that it would saddle us with moral skepticism), a core\nargument based on the work of Sharon Street may be spelled out roughly\nlike this:\nEvolutionary Debunking Argument:\n\n\u201cOur system of evaluative judgments is thoroughly saturated with\nevolutionary influence,\u201d because of the role natural selection\nplayed in shaping our underlying psychological dispositions (Street\n2006, 114). But natural selection shaped those dispositions simply\naccording to which variations best contributed to the biological\nfitness of our hominin ancestors, rather than in ways that would be\nexpected to track independent moral truths as such, even if they\nexisted. That is, natural selection rewarded moral belief-forming\ndispositions that yielded whatever moral beliefs led to behaviors that\ncaused hunter-gatherers to out-reproduce their peers and propagate\ntheir genes more effectively, regardless of whether or not these\nbeliefs happened accurately to represent a realm of independent moral\ntruths. (The same would have been true for religious beliefs and\ntheological truths: all that mattered were the relevant effects on\ngenetic propagation, as through increased cooperation and rule\nfollowing based on belief in a watchful god, assuming the religious\nbelief-forming dispositions were under genetic control and subject to\nselection pressures. Theological truth or falsity was beside the\npoint.) But since realists do not understand moral truths simply to be\na function of what helped Pleistocene hunter-gatherers to maximize\ntheir reproductive output, it would be a sheer coincidence if\nour evolutionarily shaped moral beliefs happened to align with the\nmoral truths, accurately representing them. And we are not justified\nin thinking that any such sheer coincidence has taken place.\nTherefore, we cannot have any justified confidence that our moral\nbeliefs accurately represent independent moral truths of the sort\nposited by realists. That is, our justification for our moral beliefs\nwould be defeated by these evolutionary considerations, at least if\ntruth for moral beliefs consists in accurately representing\nindependent moral facts, as realists maintain. (Epistemic internalists\nmay deny that the facts cited above would by themselves render our\nmoral beliefs unjustified, even on a realist model. But even they\nshould agree that once we become aware of those facts our\nmoral beliefs would thereby be rendered unjustified, at least given a\nrealist model of what it would be for them to be true.) So realism\nsaddles us with skepticism. And if such skepticism is implausible,\nthen realism must be rejected in favor of an antirealist view (such as\nmoral subjectivism) that would still allow for justified moral beliefs\ndespite evolutionary influences and our awareness of them (Street\n2006, 2008).\n\nOne response to this argument, on behalf of naturalistic realism,\ngrants the claim of pervasive evolutionary influence on the contents\nof moral beliefs but challenges the claim that this should undermine\nour confidence in these beliefs. David Copp (2008), for example, has\nargued that on the conception of moral truths implied by his\nsociety-centered moral naturalism, it is plausible to suppose that a\nmoral psychology shaped by natural selection in social contexts would\nyield moral beliefs that track moral truths at least reasonably well\nas a first approximation. On such a view, moral truths are grounded in\nmoral standards having to do with codes that would enable societies to\nmeet their basic needs (continued existence, stable cooperation among\nmembers, internal harmony and peaceful relations with other\nsocieties). Given the account of the evolution of human moral\npsychology sketched in section 2.3, involving the evolution of a\ncapacity for normative guidance in connection with promoting social\nstability and cooperation (ultimately, of course, because of effects\non genetic propagation), and further contributions of cultural\nevolution toward the development of moral codes fostering those same\ngoals, many of our moral beliefs would naturally have to do with\nconditions for social stability and cooperation. Since on the proposed\nnaturalistic view this is just what moral truths are about, there\nwould thus be a tendency for our moral beliefs to have been shaped in\nways that do tend to track moral truths, especially combined with\ncontinued cultural developments for correcting beliefs or attitudes\nthat fail to contribute to these social goals.\n\nStreet (2008) has replied to this proposed way out of the problem, in\npart, by noting that Copp\u2019s strategy relies on his intuitions\nabout what the moral truths are, as reflected in his society-centered\nmoral theory. But those are precisely the intuitions of an\nevolved theorist, ex hypothesi influenced by the\nsame evolutionary factors that influenced the moral beliefs in\nquestion. So of course we can expect there to be a decent alignment\nbetween our evolutionarily shaped moral beliefs and the moral truths\ndescribed by a moral theory spun by the very same evolutionarily\nshaped mind. Such a move, she argues, therefore cannot really help the\nrealist. It would be different if God independently (and convincingly)\nrevealed to us what the moral truths are, so that we could then go\ncheck our moral beliefs against them and perhaps discover that they\nline up pretty well; but instead, all we\u2019re doing is comparing our\nmoral beliefs with a purported list of moral truths yielded by a\ntheory we find plausible precisely because it is appealing to our\nevolved sensibilities (though see Locke 2014 and FitzPatrick 2014b for\nsome complications here).\n\nSimilar and even worse worries arise for a subset of non-naturalists\nwho grant the debunkers\u2019 claims about pervasive evolutionary\ninfluence on our moral beliefs and also insist that moral properties\nand facts have played no role at any point in the formation of our\nmoral beliefs, which have instead been caused by some \u2018third\nfactor\u2019 that happens to have brought about the desired\ncorrelation (Wielenberg 2010, Enoch 2011). One can, of course, tell a\nstory about some such third factor: perhaps the \u2018evolutionary\naim\u2019, survival and reproduction, also happens to be good, so\nthat in giving us moral beliefs that promoted survival and\nreproduction evolution also happened to give us moral belief\ndispositions that are largely accurate (Enoch 2011). But the question\nis again how one is entitled to rely on moral intuitions (e.g., that\nsurvival and reproduction are good) in telling that story, even\nafter granting that those intuitions are simply the product\nof \u2018morally blind\u2019 causes, i.e., causes operating entirely\ninsensitively to moral properties and facts. There are also deeper\ndifficulties concerning oversimplifications in such accounts (e.g.,\nregarding the \u2018evolutionary aim\u2019) and the fact that on\nthis approach the correlations between moral beliefs and moral truths\nultimately rest on a mere accident, raising doubts about whether such\naccounts can really make sense of the kind of moral knowledge and\nunderstanding realists think we have (Bedke 2009, FitzPatrick\n2014b).\n\nRealists have further resources, however, which can be deployed to\nsupplement a move such as Copp\u2019s, in a way that blocks the above\ndialectical worry raised by Street. Street\u2019s objection to Copp,\nafter all, has teeth only if the realist has already granted the\nstrong claims about \u201ctremendous\u201d and pervasive\nevolutionary influence \u201csaturating\u201d our moral beliefs\nacross the board. It is far from clear, however, why realists should\naccept such strong claims to begin with. As discussed in section 2, it\nseems doubtful that the scientific evidence itself supports such\nstrong claims about the etiology of \u2018our\u2019 moral beliefs. Even\nif there is significant evolutionary influence on the content of many\nof our moral beliefs, it remains possible that many of our moral\nbeliefs are arrived at partly (or in some cases wholly) through\nautonomous moral reflection and reasoning, just as with our\nmathematical, scientific and philosophical beliefs.\n\nConsider how a moral realist will approach the above debunking\nargument. It is intended to show us that realism is untenable, which\nof course means that this conclusion cannot just be assumed\nfrom the start. Yet if we begin the argument allowing that there may\nbe independent moral truths, then why should we accept the initial\nclaim about the pervasive influence of evolutionary forces on the\ncontent of our moral thinking in the first place? If there are\nindependent moral truths, then we may plausibly have grasped many of\nthem through autonomous exercises of our capacities for moral\nreflection, whereby we have come to recognize good reasons for\nthinking certain moral propositions to be true, by correctly grasping\nthat certain features of actions are wrong-making, say.\n\nFor example, your belief that human trafficking is wrong is plausibly\nbest explained by citing your reasons for holding it: you believe\nit\u2019s wrong for the reasons you give, such as the fact that it\ncauses tremendous suffering and deprivation, violates the basic\ndignity and rights of its victims, and so on. From a realist\nperspective, these features you cite in giving your reasons for the\nbelief are in fact wrong-making features of human trafficking, i.e.,\nfeatures that make trafficking wrong and therefore make true\nthe moral proposition that human trafficking is wrong. On this\npicture, you therefore believe that trafficking is wrong because it\nis wrong and you\u2019ve come to recognize the moral fact that\nit is wrong by recognizing the reasons why it is wrong (FitzPatrick\n2016).\n\nUnless realism has already been rejected for other reasons,\nthen, this picture is an open possibility at the start of the debate,\nwhich means that the realist is entitled to hold that many of our\nmoral beliefs are in fact not merely caused by evolutionary and other\n\u2018morally blind\u2019 influences, but are instead well-grounded\nresponses to moral reality. That is, the realist need never grant the\ndebunker\u2019s strong claims to the effect that our moral beliefs\nacross the board are saturated with evolutionary influence (see\nsection 2). Perhaps some are and some aren\u2019t, and the proportions\nwill depend on the extent to which we\u2019ve successfully exercised\nautonomous reflection in arriving at our moral beliefs, which is a\nwide open question. If there are enough autonomous beliefs in the mix,\nand we can identify them, then the rest of the argument will not go\nthrough (FitzPatrick 2014a,b; 2016,\n 2017a,b).[12]\n\nThe debunking argument would be strengthened if we had good reason to\nbe skeptical about autonomous moral reflection. In this vein, Street\nclaims that whatever moral reflection and reasoning we engage in is\nlimited merely to assessing \u201cthoroughly contaminated\u201d\nevaluative beliefs using \u201ctools of rational reflection [that\nare] equally contaminated\u201d (Street 2006: 124). The problem,\nhowever, is that this claim is based upon the very premise in\nquestion: the tools of reflection are allegedly thoroughly\ncontaminated because of the \u201ctremendous\u201d\nevolutionary influence on the content of \u201cour\u201d moral\njudgments across the board; yet our question is why we should believe\nthe latter in the first place. Until we are given independent reason\nto discount the power of moral reflection so radically, treating it as\nnothing more than using some rotten apples to judge other rotten\napples, we seem to have little reason to dismiss the possibility of\nautonomous moral reflection, and therefore little reason to accept the\ninitial claim of pervasive \u201csaturation\u201d of our moral\nbeliefs with evolutionary influence.\n\nStreet actually casts her argument in terms of a \u201cDarwinian\ndilemma\u201d for realists, which centers around the following\nquestion: what is the relation between the evolutionary shaping of\nmoral judgments and the independent moral truths posited by realists?\n(Street 2006, 109). As already noted, the best scientific accounts\nsuggest that there would be no special relation here, even if such\nmoral truths existed. But if there is no special relation between this\nevolutionary shaping and independent moral truths, then we would have\nno reason to trust our moral beliefs, which are as likely to be\noff-track as on-track, leading to moral skepticism. So the realist\nseems to face a dilemma: reject the best available science or\nlose all justification for our moral beliefs.\n\nAs brought out above, one way out of the dilemma for a realist is\nsimply to deny that the evolutionary influence on the content of our\nmoral beliefs is as pervasive as Street claims. The realist can grant\nthat where such influence does exist we cannot assume that it would\nhave pushed our beliefs toward moral truth: it may accidentally have\ndone so in some cases (e.g., influencing us to think we have\nobligations to care for our children) and it might have been\ndistorting in others (e.g., influencing us to downplay obligations to\nthose who do not belong to our in-group). But this is not a problem if\nwe also have a culturally developed capacity for autonomous moral\nreflection and reasoning that allows us to attain moral knowledge\ndespite the presence of some unreliable influences. Realists\nwill claim that we don\u2019t need natural selection to have\ngiven us moral beliefs that track moral truths, any more than we need\nthis in science or philosophy: all we need is for natural selection to\nhave given us faculties that we can develop, train and use in ways\nthat reliably track moral truths, and enough freedom from\nevolutionarily given instincts that we can so exercise those\nfaculties.\n\nFinally, Street challenges the realist to specify what faculty or\ncapacity might ground our capacity to arrive at independent moral\ntruths, how the former evolved, and how the latter could plausibly\nhave arisen as a byproduct of it. She claims that there is no\nplausible story to be told here, since the capacity to grasp\nindependent moral truths would have to be \u201ca highly specialized,\nsophisticated capacity\u201d akin to the human eye, and no such\nentity could plausibly emerge \u201cas the purely incidental\nbyproduct of some unrelated capacity that was selected for on other\ngrounds entirely\u201d (Street 2006, 142\u201343). But the\nrealist\u2019s story needn\u2019t take that form. The claim will be just\nthat our capacity to grasp moral truths\u2014like our capacity to\ngrasp philosophical truths about metaphysical necessity, say\u2014is\nsimply a byproduct of our general capacities for critical reasoning,\ncombined with the evolved capacity for forming and employing normative\nconcepts in our thinking and decision-making.\n\nA related but somewhat different debunking argument focuses on the\norigins of moral concepts (Joyce 2006, chap. 6). It begins\nwith the claim that we have a complete non-moral\ngenealogy of our moral beliefs\u2014a complete explanation of how\nwe\u2019ve come to believe what we do, which does not require any\nappeal to moral truths. Instead, we explain the origins of\nour moral concepts\u2014such as fairness, justice, and guilt\u2014in\nevolutionary terms, recalling that natural selection would have\nrewarded genetic propagation, not the tracking of moral truths, in\nshaping them; and then we explain our beliefs employing those moral\nconcepts in familiar sociological and psychological terms. The claim\nis then that the existence of such a non-moral geneaology of moral\nbeliefs makes the notion of moral truths \u201cexplanatorily\nsuperfluous\u201d\u2014just as truths about witches are\nexplanatorily superfluous given a complete genealogy of beliefs about\nwitches that does not involve any appeal to truths about witches. And\nif moral truths are explanatorily superfluous, then we should not\nposit them, any more than we posit truths about witches: we should\nremain agnostic about moral truth and give up any claims to moral\nknowledge. In other words, evolutionary biology leads to moral\nskepticism.\n\nThe critical questions about this argument parallel those raised about\nthe previous one. Even if it is granted that crude versions of our\nconcepts of fairness or guilt originated through evolutionary\nprocesses in our hominin ancestors, independently of any connection to\nmoral truths, it remains possible that through cultural evolution we\nhave developed refined conceptions of fairness or guilt that\ncan be employed in epistemically respectable ways (FitzPatrick 2014a).\nRegardless of how and why the concept of fairness originated, why\nshould we doubt that we can today use a refined conception of fairness\nto state moral truths, such as the truth that race-based voting laws\nare unfair and wrong? If there are grounds of skepticism about this\nthey would have to lie in reasons to doubt the soundness of our\nfirst-order moral arguments about fairness, rather than in claims\nabout how and why a crude version of the concept first arose (Nagel\n1997).\n\nAbsent such doubts, it\u2019s not clear why the mere fact of historical\nevolutionary influence should undermine our confidence in our moral\nclaims. To draw an analogy, should a theist give up her belief just\nbecause crude, ancestral forms of religious belief can be causally\nexplained without appeal to theological facts? Perhaps she will if she\nfinds no good reasons for her own belief, and concludes that it is to\nbe explained along similar lines. But if she has reflected on the\nmatter and been persuaded by a \u201ccosmological argument from fine\ntuning,\u201d for example, then it seems she might reasonably\nmaintain her belief, taking her employment of the concept of a deity\nto be epistemically legitimate despite the fact that other employments\nare subject to debunking evolutionary, sociological and psychological\nexplanations.\n\nIn general, the worry about Joyce\u2019s debunking argument is similar\nto the worry about Street\u2019s: unless we start out already\nassuming (against the realist) that there are no knowable moral\ntruths, it is hard to see why we should accept Joyce\u2019s premise\nthat we possess a complete non-moral geneaology of\nmoral judgment, and hence that it is explanatorily superfluous to\nposit moral truths. Whether or not the non-moral geneaology is\ncomplete is precisely what is in question in ongoing metaethical\ndebates: realists, who posit knowable moral truths, can reasonably\nhold that the correct explanation for at least many of our moral\nbeliefs does appeal to moral truths or facts that we have\ngrasped, while anti-realists, who deny the existence of such truths,\nclaim that the correct explanation for all of our moral beliefs\ninvolves no such appeal. The issue remains controversial. So unless\none has independently settled that issue against realism, one is\nunlikely to accept the premise that there is a complete non-moral\ngenealogy of our moral beliefs: there may well be a partial\nnon-moral genealogy, for the sorts of reasons Joyce gives, but it will\nbe complete only if none of our moral beliefs are\nthe result of our having grasped moral truths; and this negative claim\nwill be very unlikely if there are in fact knowable moral truths\n(since we would plausibly have grasped some of them, and they would\nthus figure into the explanation of some of our moral beliefs). We\nshould therefore feel compelled to grant Joyce\u2019s premise that\nthere is such a complete non-moral genealogy only if we have\nalready given up on the idea of knowable moral truths. But\nthat makes it hard to see how the argument as a whole can be used to\npersuade anyone who doesn\u2019t already accept its conclusion.\n\nIt is worth noting that the appeal to evolution to support general\nskeptical worries about ethics is not in fact new: it goes all the\nback to Darwin himself. Consider the following provocative, fanciful\nreflection (later echoed closely by E.O. Wilson 1978, 204\u2013206),\nwhich at least suggests a skeptical argument closely related to the\ndebunking arguments examined above:\n\nIt may be well first to premise that I do not wish to maintain that\nany strictly social animal, if its intellectual faculties were to\nbecome as active and as highly developed as in man, would acquire\nexactly the same moral sense as ours. In the same manner as various\nanimals have some sense of beauty, though they admire widely different\nobjects, so they might have a sense of right and wrong, though led by\nit to follow widely different lines of conduct. If, for instance, to\ntake an extreme case, men were reared under precisely the same\nconditions as hive-bees, there can hardly be a doubt that our\nunmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty\nto kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile\ndaughters; and no one would think of interfering. Nevertheless the\nbee, or any other social animal, would in our supposed case gain, as\nit appears to me, some feeling of right and wrong, or a conscience\n(Darwin 1871, 73).\n\n\nThe argument at least suggested by this passage is that our moral\nsense, which generates our moral beliefs, has the shape and content it\nhas because of the contingencies of human ecology; had creatures with\na very different ecology, such as bees, come to be rational, they\nwould thus have developed a very different moral sense suitable to\ntheir ecology. But then which of these very different moral senses\ncould be expected reliably to track moral truths (if they exist)? The\nanswer seems to be: neither (unless we simply relativize\nmoral truths to various possible ecologies, taking such truths to\nreduce to facts about effective genetic propagation\u2014though as we\nsaw in section 3, such a move has little moral plausibility). For\nmoral senses are contingent products of particular ecologies in a way\nthat cannot be expected to track independent and stable moral truths.\nWe and the hypothetical rational bees will thus have very different\nmoral outlooks, each of which is explicable in terms of our respective\necologies and will seem quite natural to those who occupy the relevant\necology (while the other\u2019s outlook will seem bizarre), but neither\nof which seems to have any claim to be a reliable guide to moral\ntruth (as usually conceived). This imaginary exercise in\nperspective thus seems to support moral skepticism: the very idea of\nindependent, stable moral truths will seem suspect (playing no role in\nthe explanation of the origins of various possible moral senses), and\nour confidence that our moral sense would track them in any case will\nseem unwarranted.\n\nWhat such an argument overlooks, however, is precisely the factor of\nautonomous moral reflection that the bees\u2019 imagined\nrationality would bring with it (see sections 2.4\u20132.5, and\nMcDowell 1995). True, we might expect relatively unreflective and\ntradition-bound bees to speak of \u201csacred duties\u201d to kill\nbrothers or fertile daughters, in a way that lines up with the\nrelevant genetic relations that figured into the evolution of their\ngiven moral senses. But we could equally expect more reflective bees\n(the buzzing philosophers among them) to raise the question whether\nthey really had good reason to do everything that their\nevolution has disposed them to do in the service of maximizing their\ngenetic propagation. These more philosophical bees might consider the\npossibility that some potential goods of bee life, in the context of\nongoing innovations in rational bee culture, might be available to\nthem if they resisted certain impulses and acted differently; and this\nmight lead to the development of at least partly autonomous moral\nnorms, and hence moral senses that are a complex mixture of inherited\ndispositions and rational judgment.\n\nIf bees became rational, then, there is no reason to suppose that\ntheir moral sensibilities would simply reflect their ecology any more\nthan human moral sensibilities simply reflect human ecology: to the\nextent that they are really rational, we should expect some autonomous\nreflection, and perhaps even significant overlap with autonomous human\nmoral reflection, as we both strive for something beyond the merely\nbiologically useful (FitzPatrick 2000, 355\u201356, and 2017b). This\nis not to suggest, of course, that moral truths or objective moral\nnorms, if they exist, will be exactly the same for human life and for\nrational bee life, or for actual human life and human life imagined\nunder vastly different ecological circumstances. On any plausible view\nof morality, there will be significant variation in moral principles\nand/or their applications where there is significant variation in the\nbasic facts of life. Just as we could never live just like bees, bees\ncould never live just like humans, and no reasonable morality would\ndemand such a thing. Even a realist, then, will grant a significant\ndegree of cross-species moral relativism (or counterfactual moral\nrelativism for deeply different courses of human evolution). But it\nneedn\u2019t be the extreme and implausible relativism linking true\nmoral standards simply and directly to ecology, and whatever moral\ntruths might obtain for each species might well be accessible to\nmembers of each species through autonomous moral reflection, with at\nleast some points of convergence.\n4.2 Selective Evolutionary Debunking Arguments\n\nBefore leaving the topic of evolutionary debunking arguments, it\nshould be noted that in addition to the general arguments considered\nabove, which are aimed at debunking morality (or in Street\u2019s case,\ndebunking a realist construal of morality) as a whole, there\nare also evolutionary debunking arguments meant instead just to target\na selected range of moral beliefs as epistemically suspect.\nSuch selective debunking arguments may be deployed by moral realists\nwho reject general debunking arguments in this domain but nonetheless\nwish to use similar tactics to discredit certain kinds of moral belief\nas part of advancing their own normative ethical project.\nThey might argue, for example, that while the deontological beliefs\nheld by their opponents can be successfully debunked by appeal to\nevolutionary considerations, their own utilitarian ethical beliefs are\nimmune from such debunking, stemming from autonomous rational\nreflection rather than from evolved psychological modules shaped by\nthe distorting influences of natural selection.\n\nThis is the strategy adopted by Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek and Peter\nSinger (2014) in an effort to support Sidgwick\u2019s principle of\nUniversal Benevolence, i.e., impartial utilitarianism. That principle\nis inconsistent not only with moral egoism but with any moral\nstance that incorporates limited forms of partiality (such as special\nduties to family and friends even when not utility-maximizing, or\nconstraints against taking certain means\nwhen promoting utility, or moral permissions to favor\noneself or loved ones to some degree over strangers). So in order to\ndiscredit such competing moral views, they claim that one can tell\ndebunking evolutionary stories to \u2018explain away\u2019 these\nnon-utilitarian moral beliefs as unreliable products of distorting\nevolutionary influences: people believe such things only because\nnatural selection shaped human moral psychology in the direction of\nselfishness and at best parochial altruism, for Darwinian reasons\nhaving nothing to do with moral truth. Then, in effect, they treat the\npossibility of telling such debunking evolutionary stories as\nsufficient to undermine epistemic justification for the targeted moral\nbeliefs. At the same time, however, they maintain that their own\nfavored ethical beliefs, involving strict impartiality, are\ninvulnerable to any similar treatment, so that we can remain confident\nin the rationality of utilitarian morality.\n\nThere are reasons to doubt whether this sort of theoretically\nambitious but selective evolutionary debunking strategy is a viable or\nstable one (Kahane 2011 and 2014, Rini 2016, FitzPatrick 2017a).\nA natural worry is that if such debunking arguments really worked\nagainst opponents of utilitarianism in the manner suggested, then\nsimilar arguments could equally be deployed against\nutilitarianism if we play by the same rules. The selective\ndebunking arguments used by de Lazari-Radek and Singer give a great\ndeal of negative epistemic weight to the mere existence of possible\ndebunking explanations which, if true, would clearly pose a\nproblem for the targeted beliefs (even though it remains a wide open\nquestion whether such explanatory stories are in fact true). That is,\nthey give great weight to the mere ability to tell a plausible\ndebunking story according to which non-utilitarian moral beliefs\nwould turn out to be problematically rooted in \u2018contaminated\nstarting points\u2019 (psychological dispositions resulting from\nmorally blind evolutionary forces) that have merely been refined over\ntime by culturally conditioned causal influences operating equally\nblindly to moral truths. This raises problems for them, however,\nbecause one can easiliy enough come up with similar debunking stories\nabout utilitarian beliefs, according to which they would\nequally turn out to be problematically shaped by morally-blind\nevolutionary forces that contaminated the starting points.\n\nHere is just one way such a story could go (FitzPatrick 2017a). Recall\nthe possibility discussed in sub-sections 2.2 and 2.3, that in early\nancestral environments involving mostly small in-group interactions,\nwhere there were relatively few opportunities for \u2018wasting\u2019\naltruistic tendencies on outsiders, natural selection gave rise to\nsome fairly indiscriminate dispositions involving sympathy\nand altruism. (Or again, recall the adaptive plasticity model from\nBuchanan and Powell 2018, discussed in section 3.4, which posits\nenvironmentally sensitive inclusivist tendencies as part of evolved\nhuman psychology.) As long as such indiscriminate altruism contributed\nmore to fitness in that environment than it detracted from it through\noccasional \u2018misfirings\u2019 of such sentiments and behaviors\ndirected at non-cooperators, it could very well have evolved as a\nsimple fitness-enhancing mechanism (Kitcher 2006b). Someone who wishes\nto debunk impartial utilitarianism might then tell a story according\nto which the utilitarian\u2019s impartial sympathy and concern is\nnothing but an extension of this evolved psychological trait, whereby\nit is systematically \u2018misfiring\u2019 (from a biological point of\nview) in our current environment. More precisely, the story would be\nthat current utilitarian beliefs represent a cultural refinement of\nsuch evolved tendencies via an application of reasoning, such\nas the consistency reasoning utilitarians employ in arguing for an\n\u201cexpanding circle\u201d of moral concern and an increasingly\nimpartial altruism. The debunker will claim that however rational such\ninferential steps may be in themselves, they are still just operating\non certain moral starting points that are \u2018contaminated\u2019\nby evolutionary influence: namely, deeply ingrained moral intuitions\nabout the intrinsic badness of suffering wherever it occurs,\nor the goodness of pleasure, which trace back to evolved psychological\ndispositions to recoil at suffering and injury, and to feel sympathy\nfor others. Basic utilitarian moral intuitions, no less than\nnon-utilitarian intuitions, may ultimately be nothing but illusions\nfoisted on us by our evolutionary history, rooted in contaminated\nstarting points (Ruse 2006). In both cases, proponents of the moral\nviews in question have moved well beyond the original evolved\ndispositions, through culturally-developed reasoning that has refined\nthem in various ways. But if this doesn\u2019t save non-utilitarian\nmoral beliefs given the debunking story about the contaminated\nstarting points, then it won\u2019t save utilitarian moral beliefs\neither.\n\nNow de Lazari-Radek and Singer might reasonably wish to counter such\ndebunking attacks by claiming that even if there are such evolutionary\ninfluences at the root of their intuitions about the badness of\nsuffering or the propriety of impartial altruism, the reflection and\nreasoning that has taken place over centuries of sophisticated moral\ninquiry has not merely provided for more consistent applications of\nevolutionarily contaminated dispositions: it has instead amounted to\nthe intellectual discovery of good reasons to believe the\ncontents of utilitarian moral claims to be true. This\nphilosophical possibility certainly remains on the table and\nhasn\u2019t been shown not to obtain simply because an aspiring\ndebunker can tell a debunking story according to which it doesn\u2019t.\nAnd such a reply would indeed be a plausible response to the debunker,\nmaking precisely the point emphasized earlier in section 4.1, in\nresponding to general debunking arguments. The problem, however, is\nthat if they are entitled to make this response to the debunker on\nbehalf of utilitarian moral beliefs, then so are their opponents on\nbehalf of non-utilitarian moral beliefs: what\u2019s good for the\nutilitarian goose is good for the non-utilitarian gander.\n\nIn other words, to escape evolutionary debunking themselves, it seems\nthat de Lazari-Radek and Singer will have to allow that the mere\nexistence of a possible evolutionary debunking explanation for a set\nof moral beliefs does not undermine epistemic justification for them.\nIt matters whether or not that story is actually the correct\nexplanatory story, including its claim that the beliefs in question\nare exhaustively accounted for simply in terms of the\nmorally-blind, extraneous causes in question, rather than partly\nthrough rational grasp of good reasons for believing their contents to\nbe true; and merely being able to tell a debunking story does not\nestablish such a strong claim. Once this is recognized,\nhowever, the same principle applies to just the sorts of\ndebunking arguments they have deployed against non-utilitarians, who\ncan thus avoid them in the same way.\n\nOne or more of the debunking stories could, of course, still turn out\nto be true, and they do need to be taken seriously as\npossibilities. The critical points raised here are just,\nfirst, that it is unclear whether debunking arguments really have\ncompelling force against those who haven\u2019t already\nindependently rejected the positions being targeted (showing them that\ntheir beliefs are really bunk); and second, that it may be\nhazardous for those who reject general evolutionary debunking\narguments in ethics to attempt to use similar arguments selectively\nagainst competing normative ethical views. Such potential\nexplanations could, however, still play a supporting role within a\nbroader set of moral arguments, contributing a possible theory of\nerror helping to explain why some people may believe certain moral\nclaims or theories even though they are false.\n4.3 Evolutionary Biology and Expressivism\n\nA less ambitious claim made by some antirealists is that the account\nin section 2.3 of the origins of our capacity for normative guidance\nat least lends support to or fits naturally with an\nexpressivist metaethical view\u2014the view that moral\njudgments do not even purport to state moral facts, but instead\nexpress non-cognitive states such as attitudes or acceptance of\ncertain norms, etc. (Gibbard 1990; Kitcher 2006a). Suppose the human\ncapacity for normative guidance is indeed an adaptation that evolved\nin connection with social coordination, cooperation and stability.\nThis capacity involves being in the state of accepting a\nnorm, which we should thus expect to be a standard part of human\nmoral psychology and its capacity for \u201clinguistically infused\nmotivation\u201d (Gibbard 1990, 55). This may lend support to a\nnorm-expressivist approach to normative judgment, insofar as such an\napproach focuses precisely on the notion of accepting a norm, and the\nevolutionary story provides good reason to suppose that accepting a\nnorm is a \u201cnatural, biological phenomenon\u201d (61).\n\nIt is less clear, however, whether anything stronger than this can be\nsaid. Suppose it\u2019s true that we evolved a capacity and tendency\nfor normative guidance because of the coordinating social function\nachieved by the expression of norm acceptance. Not only does this\nleave open what we now use that capacity to do, but it even\nleaves open what exactly our ancestors did with it. One possibility is\nthat the activity they were engaged with was non-cognitive:\nthey were merely expressing non-cognitive states comprising attitudes\nand states of norm acceptance. Kitcher (2006a) suggests that this is\nthe metaethical picture best supported by the evolutionary story. But\nJoyce (2006, 175\u201376) has disputed this. Even granting that the\nbiological function of moral judgment is social coordination,\nthe linguistic function of moral judgments could go either\nway: it may be that the biological function was carried out through\nnon-cognitive expressions of norm acceptance, but it may equally\ninstead be that it was carried out through cognitive\njudgments involving claims to objective validity. Indeed, the\nsocial function might be all the better served if those making moral\njudgments firmly believe in objective values and assert those beliefs,\neven if they are in fact making a projective error in doing so, as\nerror theorists claim. Compare: even if religious belief has a\nbiological function (e.g., reducing anxiety), it wouldn\u2019t follow\nthat religious assertions are non-cognitive and so aren\u2019t really\nassertions, and the story might be more plausible if it is assumed\nthat they are genuine assertions (Joyce 2006, 176, 208; Ruse\n2006).\n\nThus, although the evolutionary story fits naturally with a merely\nnon-cognitivist metaethical view, it may fit equally well with a\ncognitivist view. If one rejects the existence of moral truths, the\nlatter would then lead to an error theory (Mackie 1977). But as\ndiscussed in section 4.1, it is far from clear how much support\nevolutionary biology itself lends to moral anti-realism or irrealism.\nIt is consistent with plausible evolutionary stories that although our\ncapacities for normative guidance originally evolved for reasons that\nhad nothing to do with moral truths as such, we now regularly employ\nthem to deliberate about and to communicate moral truths. So all three\nmetaethical views discussed here\u2014expressivism, error theory and\nmoral realism\u2014remain on the table.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alexander, R., 1987, <em>The Biology of Moral Systems</em>, New\nYork: Aldine de Gruyter.", "Appiah, K.A., 2008, <em>Experiments in Ethics</em>, Cambridge, MA:\nHarvard University Press.", "Axelrod, R., 1984, <em>The Evolution of Cooperation</em>, New\nYork: Basic Books.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2006, \u201cBiology to Ethics: An\nEvolutionist\u2019s View of Human Nature,\u201d in Boniolo, G. and De\nAnna, G., <em>Evolutionary Ethics and Contemporary Biology</em>, pp.\n141\u201358.", "Bedke, M., 2009, \u201cIntuitive Non-Naturalism Meets Cosmic\nCoincidence,\u201d <em>Pacific Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 90:\n188\u2013209.", "Berker, S., 2009, \u201cThe Normative Insignificance of\nNeuroscience,\u201d <em>Philosophy and Public Affairs</em>, 37:\n293\u2013329.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2014, \u201cDoes Evolutionary Psychology\nShow that Normativity is Mind-Dependent?\u201d in J.
