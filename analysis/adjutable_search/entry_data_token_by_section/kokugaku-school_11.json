    "main_text": "Meiji Period (1868\u20131912) Kokugaku\n6. Kokugaku after Meiji\n\nLooking beyond the scope of the current entry, during the early\ndecades of the twentieth century one observes the fragmentation of\nKokugaku into numerous fields analogous to the broader sense of\nJapanese studies that informed Kada no Azumamaro\u2019s Kokugaku two\ncenturies earlier: folklore and ethnographic studies that built on the\npioneering work of Yanagida Kunio and Orikuchi Shinobu; rationales for\nthe kind of organic imperial theocracy such as was memorialized in the\n1890 Imperial Rescript on Education; the effort to historicize the\nessentialist concept of Kokutai or unique National Polity; and so\non.\n\nIn the immediate years following Japan\u2019s surrender in 1945,\nKokugaku was virtually a taboo topic in Japan\u2019s academic circles\noutside a handful of Shinto seminaries like Kokugakuin Daigaku in\nTokyo. Specialized studies of Japanese history, literature and\nreligions were of course permitted and even encouraged, but efforts to\nhistoricize Japanese essentialism were off-limits. Further,\nexpressions of Japanese racial or cultural superiority such as those\nthat had fueled the international excesses of the Asia-Pacific War\nyears were replaced in popular discourse by alternative claims of\nJapanese uniqueness: that Japanese people were naturally or\nintrinsically inclined toward harmonious behavior, and are\ncharacterized by diligence, frugality, honesty, and sensitivity to\nseasonal change; that these qualities explain Japan\u2019s success in\neconomic development and social stability, and that those traditional\nqualities are uniquely configured in contemporary Japanese society.\nThis began to change from the mid-1970s when scholarly studies of\nKokugaku\u2019s political and social thought\u2014the so-called\nnative ancient Way\u2014resumed in Japan, as did academic\nappointments for scholars with these specialties at Japan\u2019s\nleading universities. \n\nTheories of Japaneseness, collectively referred to as\n\nNihonjinron, have figured prominently in Japanese popular\nculture since the 1970s. Notions of Japan as an animistic\nspirit-infused realm in which humans can commune with animals and\nother objects and forces of nature are ubiquitous in Japan, coursing\nthrough popular manga and anime. These enjoy not\njust enormous popular appeal in Japan and worldwide, but also\ngovernment support as forms of \u201csoft power\u201d fundamental to\nthe representation of Japanese society outside Japan.\n",
