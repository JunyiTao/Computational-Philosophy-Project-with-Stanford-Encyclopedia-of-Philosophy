    "main_text": "Major Themes in Emerson\u2019s Philosophy || Unity and Moods\n2.6 Unity and Moods\n\nAt some point in many of his essays and addresses, Emerson enunciates,\nor at least refers to, a great vision of unity. He speaks in\n\u201cThe American Scholar\u201d of an \u201coriginal unit\u201d\nor \u201cfountain of power\u201d (CW1: 53), of which each of us is a\npart. He writes in \u201cThe Divinity School Address\u201d that each\nof us is \u201can inlet into the deeps of Reason.\u201d And in\n\u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d the essay that more than any other\ncelebrates individuality, he writes of \u201cthe resolution of all\ninto the ever-blessed ONE\u201d (CW2: 40). \u201cThe Oversoul\u201d\nis Emerson\u2019s most sustained discussion of \u201cthe ONE,\u201d\nbut he does not, even there, shy away from the seeming conflict\nbetween the reality of process and the reality of an ultimate\nmetaphysical unity. How can the vision of succession and the vision of\nunity be reconciled?\n\nEmerson never comes to a clear or final answer. One solution he both\nsuggests and rejects is an unambiguous idealism, according to which a\nnontemporal \u201cOne\u201d or \u201cOversoul\u201d is the only\nreality, and all else is illusion. He suggests this, for example, in\nthe many places where he speaks of waking up out of our dreams or\nnightmares. But he then portrays that to which we awake not simply as\nan unchanging \u201cONE,\u201d but as a process or succession: a\n\u201cgrowth\u201d or \u201cmovement of the soul\u201d (CW2: 189);\nor a \u201cnew yet unapproachable America\u201d (CW3: 259).\n\nEmerson undercuts his visions of unity (as of everything else) through\nwhat Stanley Cavell calls his \u201cepistemology of moods.\u201d\nAccording to this epistemology, most fully developed in\n\u201cExperience\u201d but present in all of Emerson\u2019s\nwriting, we never apprehend anything \u201cstraight\u201d or\nin-itself, but only under an aspect or mood. Emerson writes that life\nis \u201ca train of moods like a string of beads,\u201d through\nwhich we see only what lies in each bead\u2019s focus (CW3: 30). The\nbeads include our temperaments, our changing moods, and the\n\u201cLords of Life\u201d which govern all human experience. The\nLords include \u201cSuccession,\u201d \u201cSurface,\u201d\n\u201cDream,\u201d \u201cReality,\u201d and\n\u201cSurprise.\u201d Are the great visions of unity, then, simply\naspects under which we view the world?\n\nEmerson\u2019s most direct attempt to reconcile succession and unity,\nor the one and the many, occurs in the last essay in the Essays,\nSecond Series, entitled \u201cNominalist and Realist.\u201d\nThere he speaks of the universe as an \u201cold Two-face\u2026of\nwhich any proposition may be affirmed or denied\u201d (CW3: 144). As\nin \u201cExperience,\u201d Emerson leaves us with the whirling\nsuccession of moods. \u201cI am always insincere,\u201d he\nskeptically concludes, \u201cas always knowing there are other\nmoods\u201d (CW3: 145). But Emerson enacts as well as describes the\nsuccession of moods, and he ends \u201cNominalist and Realist\u201d\nwith the \u201cfeeling that all is yet unsaid,\u201d and with at\nleast the idea of some universal truth (CW3: 363).\n",
