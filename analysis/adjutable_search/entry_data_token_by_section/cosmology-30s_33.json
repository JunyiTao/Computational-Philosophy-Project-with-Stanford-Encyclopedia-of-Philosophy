    "main_text": "Steady-state Cosmology || Return of the Cosmological Principle\n8.5 A Popperian Conclusion\n\nIn the end, the philosophical purity of Bondi\u2019s steady state\ntheory served him, and cosmology, well. Of course, the usual suspect,\nDingle, and others of his ilk, such as McVittie in particular, were\noutraged, and loudly, at Bondi\u2019s extension of Milne\u2019s\nmethods. A passage from Dingle\u2019s R.A.S. Presidential Address\nsuffices to show the tenor of the debate\u2019s declining days:\n\nEven idle speculation may not be quite valueless if it is recognized\nfor what it is. If the new cosmologists would observe this proviso,\ncalling a spade a spade and not a perfect agricultural principle,\none\u2019s only cause for regret would be that such great talents\nwere spent for so little profit. (Dingle 1953, p. 406)\n\n\nBut PCP and the theory which it engendered were exactly as described:\neminently falsifiable. No matter the extent of Dingle et\nal\u2019s disdain, Steady State theory stayed right out in\nfront, ready for whatever empirical observations might be slung at it.\nAs Bondi said \u201cShow me some fossils from an evolving universe,\nand I\u2019ll give it up.\u201d In 1965, the fossils arrived,\ncourtesy of the observations of the 3\u00b0 K remnant microwave\nradiation.\n\nAnd Bondi, true to his philosophy, gave it up.\n",
