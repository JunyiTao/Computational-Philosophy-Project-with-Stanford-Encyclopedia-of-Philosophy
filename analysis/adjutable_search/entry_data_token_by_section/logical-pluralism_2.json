    "main_text": "Case-Based Logical Pluralism || The Argument from Virtue\n1.2 The Argument from Virtue\n\nA different argument for logical pluralism invokes the view\u2019s\ncombined practical and theoretical virtues:\n\n\nOne virtue is that the plurality of the consequence relation comes at\nlittle or no cost. Another is that pluralism offers a more charitable\ninterpretation of many important (but difficult) debates in\nphilosophical logic than is otherwise available; we will argue that\npluralism does more justice to the mix of insight and perplexity found\nin many of the debates in logic in the last century. (Beall &\nRestall 2006: 31)\n\n\nPluralists have also stressed that their view encourages innovation in\nlogic (Carnap 1937: foreword), and allows one to study more\nmathematical theories, such as those that would be rendered trivial by\nclassical logic (S. Shapiro 2014: Ch. 3).\n\nSuch claims can be quite difficult to assess. Some important\ndistinctions need to be drawn between theoretical and practical\nreasons to endorse pluralism, and even once this has been done it can\nbe difficult to decide whether the view over all really possesses a\nvirtue\u2014it may depend on substantive empirical claims for which\nthe evidence has yet to be gathered. It can also be hard to determine\nwhether or not the view possesses a greater weight of virtues than\nrival theories (is not logical monism a simpler theory, and simplicity\na theoretical virtue too?), and finally whether or not that is a good\nreason to believe the view.\n\nFor example, one virtue claimed for logical pluralism is charity, but\nnot all instances of charity are theoretically virtuous; no-one should\nthink that deterministic physics is more likely to be correct because\nit allows a more charitable view of wrong-doers, or of Einstein.\nCharity can be misplaced. But one place where charity is taken\nseriously as a theoretical virtue is in the assessment of theories of\nmeaning and translation\u2014though even here it can be misplaced,\nsince it is not a virtue if a theory interprets infants as uttering\ntrue claims about quantum mechanics (Davidson 1973 [1984]). Logical\npluralism is not itself a thesis about translation or interpretation,\nbut one about logics and how many there are. Nonetheless, the version\noutlined above rests on some substantive claims about the meaning of\n\u201cvalid\u201d and \u201cfollows from\u201d and it might be\nargued that it is proper to invoke charity in adjudicating between\nthis theory and rival ones for that reason: we are deciding between\ntheories which interpret \u201cvalid\u201d and \u201cfollows\nfrom\u201d differently. Perhaps one of these interpretations seems to\nmake our informants (both ordinary language users and the experts who\nhave written about logic) responsible for fewer false claims.\n\nBut an opponent might respond that interpreting ordinary speakers as\nuttering truths concerning logic can look similar to attributing true\nbeliefs about quantum mechanics to infants. As the Wason selection\ntask experiments have shown in psychology, even educated speakers will\nfail to act as if the argument form modus tollens is correct in\ncertain circumstances (Wason 1966, 1968; Cosmides 1989). Though the\nmost charitable interpretation of their behaviour might be that they\ndo not mean by \u201cfollows from\u201d what the experimenters meant\nby it, by far the most natural understanding of what is going on here\nis that the subjects make mistakes. To interpret them as meaning\nsomething different by \u201cvalid\u201d misses what these\nexperiments reveal about human reasoning, and fails to explain why the\nsubjects later judge that their earlier answers were wrong.\n\nThe logical pluralist can agree with this, but distinguish between\nbeing charitable to ordinary speakers, and being charitable to expert\nlogicians. It is expert logicians, they might maintain, that we should\ninterpret charitably, including those experts who have proposed\napparently incompatible systems. Relevant logicians have written\n\u201cdisjunctive syllogism is not valid\u201d. Classical logicians\nhave written \u201cdisjunctive syllogism is valid\u201d.\nIntuitionist logicians say \u201cdouble negation elimination is not\nvalid\u201d. Classical logicians have retorted \u201cdouble negation\nelimination is so valid\u201d. If logical monism is correct, at least\ntwo or more of these parties have claimed falsehoods. Logical\npluralism would allow us to say that more than one, perhaps many more\nthan one, have been writing truths.\n\nBut logical pluralism is also uncharitable in ways that\nlogical monism is not, since it holds that the monist participants in\ndebates over which logic is correct have been arguing based on a\nconfusion. The upshot with respect to the argument from charity, and\nfrom virtue more generally, is that quite a lot remains to be done\nbefore it will be clear which virtues are desirable and the extent to\nwhich logical pluralism possesses them to a greater degree than its\nrivals.\n",
