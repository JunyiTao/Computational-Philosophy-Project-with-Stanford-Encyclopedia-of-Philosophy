    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nChauncey Wright was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, in 1830, where\nhis family had lived since colonial times and where his father had\nbeen a merchant and deputy-sheriff of the county. In 1848, he entered\nHarvard College. His education there included two years of advanced\nstudy in natural sciences. Graduating in 1852, he took employment with\nthe Nautical Almanac office in Cambridge as a computer.  This work\nconstituted his livelihood throughout his life. He concentrated his\nwork for each year into the last three months of the year, devoting\nthe rest of the time to his own studies in the logic of science and\nmetaphysics.\n\n\nThe first philosophical influence on Wright was the Scottish\nrealist, Sir William Hamilton, whose works formed the curriculum for\nFrancis Bowen's teaching of philosophy at Harvard. Wright was, however,\ngreatly influenced by John Stuart Mill's criticism of Hamilton, and the\ninfluence of Mill is evident in Wright's views on utility in science\nand ethics. The great conversion of his life came, however, with his\nreading of Darwin's Origin of Species, published in 1859.\nWright became an American defender of Darwin against his religious\nantagonists and also, like Harvard's Asa Gray, against Darwin's\nscientific critics in America.\n\n\nWright taught for a short time at Harvard, but was not successful as\na lecturer. He was an intellectual conversationalist and\nthrough his participation in a succession of study groups in Cambridge,\ninfluenced Charles S. Peirce, William James, and Oliver Wendell Holmes,\nJr., among others. In spite of his perspicacity and his dispassionate\nlogical approach to discussion, he also had a gentle, sometimes\nangelic, temperament. Children liked him and he was willing to spend\ntime entertaining them. He was close to Charles Eliot Norton and his\nfamily and exchanged many letters with Norton's sisters. When his\nfriends were away for extended periods, Wright's spirits and health\nsuffered. He endured two bouts of deep depression from which his\nfriends roused him. Among his friends Wright counted both William and\nHenry James. William James said of Wright, \u201cNever in a human head\nwas contemplation more separated from desire.\u201d Wright died of a\nstroke in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1875, at the age of \n 45.[3]\n",
