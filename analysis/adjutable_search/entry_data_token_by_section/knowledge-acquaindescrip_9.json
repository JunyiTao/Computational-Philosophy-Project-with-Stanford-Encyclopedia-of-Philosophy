    "main_text": "Criticisms || The Sellarsian Dilemma\n7.1 The Sellarsian Dilemma\n\nIn developing the view, we have already responded to one of its most\ncommon criticisms. As was noted above, it has been argued (most\nfamously by Sellars 1963) that even if there were such a thing as\nacquaintance with individuals, properties, or facts, that relation\nwouldn\u2019t give one knowledge of truths. The observation\nis correct (since acquaintance with something does not amount to a\njudgment, let alone a true judgment, about it), but it is irrelevant\nto the more sophisticated view according to which the acquaintance\nwith the relevant fact is only a constituent of the ground of\npropositional knowledge. As we have seen\n (section 3),\n acquaintance theorists typically add conditions that make the fact\nwith which one is acquainted directly relevant to the truth of some\nthought or belief\u2014e.g., by requiring awareness of the\ncorrespondence or fit (or perhaps some other relation) between the\nthought and the fact, or by requiring that the fact constitute part of\nthe content of the belief.\n\nThese sophisticated views also seem capable of handling a closely\nrelated, influential objection. Inspired by Sellars, BonJour (1978,\n1985) presented the following dilemma for any foundationalist view\nthat takes one\u2019s justification to consist in or depend\nessentially on some sort of awareness, acquaintance, or apprehension.\n(See also, Sellars 1963: Part I, 1975; Davidson 1983; McDowell 1994;\nand Williams 2005.) Is the awareness or acquaintance that is the\nalleged source of noninferential justification propositional or\nconceptual? That is, does it involve the acceptance of a proposition\nor thought, or at least the categorization of some sensory item or the\napplication of some concept to experience? If, on the one hand, the\nacquaintance or awareness is propositional or conceptual in this way,\nthen while such acts or episodes of awareness seem capable, in\nprinciple, of justifying other beliefs, they would surely need to be\njustified themselves. The episode of awareness would involve something\nlike the acceptance of a proposition, and such an attitude clearly\nneeds justification if it is to justify anything else. But then, the\nallegedly foundational belief is not foundational after all. If, on\nthe other hand, we can regard direct awareness as nonpropositional and\nnonconceptual, then while these acts or states of awareness do not\nrequire or even admit of justification\u2014for simply being aware of\nsomething is a mental state that is clearly neither justified nor\nunjustified\u2014they also don\u2019t seem capable on their own of\nproviding a reason or justification for propositional items like\nbeliefs. Therefore, the classical foundationalist\u2019s acquaintance\nor direct awareness cannot serve as a foundational source of knowledge\nor justified belief.\n\nMost sophisticated versions of classical foundationalism are perhaps\nbest understood as grasping the nonpropositional horn of the dilemma,\nsince acquaintance is a nonpropositional form of awareness. Fumerton\n(1995: 75) replies that while acquaintance itself is nonpropositional,\nthat does not rule out that propositions or thoughts are objects of\nacquaintance or constituents of objects of acquaintance, and if one is\nacquainted with a relation of correspondence between a thought and a\nfact, that would seem to provide all the justification one could need\nor want. As we have seen, BonJour (2003) gives a similar reply that\nappeals to direct awareness of some fact and a direct recognition of\nthe fit between the fact and the proposition believed. He regards this\nrecognition as judgmental or propositional, and that may lead some to\npush the propositional horn again: we need something further to\njustify the judgment of fit, and so the regress of justification has\nnot yet come to an end. (For a response, see BonJour 2003: 193. For\nsome critical discussion, see Bergmann 2006: Ch. 2.) McGrew, Chalmers,\nand others who adopt the demonstrative or phenomenal concept strategy\nmight reply that at least in the case of demonstratively formed\nbeliefs the relevance of the truth maker to the proposition believed\nis transparent and guaranteed by the manner in which the belief is\nformed: acquaintance simply picks out some feature of experience and\ntakes it up into the content of a belief or judgment that asserts that\nthe feature exists or is instantiated.\n",
