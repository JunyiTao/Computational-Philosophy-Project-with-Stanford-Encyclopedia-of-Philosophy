    "main_text": "Randomness Without Chance || Drawing Without Replacement\n5.4 Drawing Without Replacement\n\n\n The last objection draws on a remark made in\n \u00a74.4.\n Consider a large finite urn full of \nblack and white balls. The number of balls is sufficiently large that\nthe sequence of outcomes of draws is long enough to be random. So\nsuppose we make a random selection from this urn, drawing balls\nwithout replacement until the urn is empty. The resulting sequence of\noutcomes is, or at least could be, random\u2014it had better be,\nsince this sequence meets all the conditions to be a simple random\nsample from the population. (We could attach a number to each member\nof an experimental population, and give the \\(n\\)-th member a\npill of an active substance (respectively, a placebo) if\nthe \\(n\\)-th draw is black (white).) But in this process, the\noutcomes become less and less chancy as the number of balls\ndiminishes. Since there are only finitely many balls, there will a\ndraw such that the chance of it being black is either 1 or 0, and so\nwhatever outcome eventuates did not occur by chance. But then we have\na random sequence that includes an outcome (drawing a black ball,\nsay) which did not happen by chance, contrary to RCT.\n\n\nOne response is to say that this last outcome did happen by chance,\nsince at the start of the drawing there was a positive chance that a\nwhite ball would be drawn last, and a positive chance that a black ball\nwould be. This response neglects the time-dependence of chances. If\nthere were \\(n\\) balls initially, and we let \u2018Lastie\u2019\nname the ball that was in actual fact drawn last, then we can say: the\nchance that Lastie is drawn last was \\(1/n\\) initially, and after\nthe \\(m\\)-th draw it was \\(1/(n - m)\\), until\nit reached 1 and remained there. At that last stage it was no longer a\nmatter of chance whether Lastie would be drawn last; it is the only\nball left in the urn. RCT maintains that a given outcome happens by\nchance iff it is part of a random sequence. At every time, the event of\nLastie being drawn last is part of a random sequence. But then there is\nat least one time at which Lastie being drawn last is part of random\nsequence but, at that time, it did not happen by chance.\n(Alternatively, of course, it could be maintained that even events with\ntrivial chances happen by chance. But this would permit again the\nproblem of biased sequences; a string of all heads tossed by a\ntwo-headed coin could then be random, which it is not.)\n",
