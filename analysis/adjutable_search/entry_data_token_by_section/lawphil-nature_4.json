    "main_text": "The Methodology of Jurisprudence || Is Legal Theory Inherently Evaluative?\n2.2 Is Legal Theory Inherently Evaluative?\n\n\nA second widely-discussed question about jurisprudential methodology\nis whether first-order legal theories are inherently evaluative. The\nabove views about the proper target of first-order theories of law have\ndifferent implications about this second question. But before\nexplaining that, we must first get the relevant question more clearly\nin view.\n2.2.1 Preliminaries\n\n\nTo begin with, one might wonder where the interest in the question\nof whether legal theory is inherently evaluative comes from. Some of\nthis interest likely traces to the skeptical worry that legal theories\npurporting to be purely descriptive in fact are pushing some hidden\nideological or political agenda. (For more on this, see, e.g.,\nJohn Gardner\u2019s introduction to Dickson 2004.) A second source of\nthe interest in this question may be the suspicion (or hope) that if\nlegal theory proves to be inherently evaluative, that would be an\nindependent reason to adopt some version of natural law theory. Whether\nthis is so remains doubtful, however, since meta-questions about the\nmethodology of legal theory prima facie seem to be independent\nof questions in first-order legal theory like what the determinants of\nthe content of law are. What is more, legal scholars might be drawn to\nthe present issue through consideration of Dworkin\u2019s argument\nthat there is a very tight connection between the evaluative nature of\ntheorizing about the law and the evaluative nature of law itself,\nrendering the content of law inevitably dependent, at least in part, on\nmoral-political considerations. Regardless of the motivations for\nengaging in the debate about whether legal theory is inherently\nevaluative, however, this debate has taken on independent significance\nand has been a fruitful source of insight in its own right.\n\n\nTo avoid confusion, the question we are concerned with here must be\nclarified in several ways. For there are a number of\nuncontroversial ways in which legal theory plausibly is or\nmight be evaluative, and these do not go to the heart of the\nmethodological debates in jurisprudence.\n\n\nFirst, there are several trivial ways in which legal theory, like\ntheories about any topic, plausibly cannot be entirely\nvalue-free. In particular, it seems that one cannot engage in the\nbusiness of theorizing about law without evaluating the extent to which\nvarious theories are coherent, simple, clear, elegant, comprehensive,\nand so on (Dickson 2004, 32\u201333). Granted this means that legal\ntheorists must engage in a form of evaluation. But there is nothing\nspecial about legal theory in this regard. After all, these\nmeta-theoretical virtues are criteria for the success of theories about\nany subject matter.\n \n\nA second seemingly uncontroversial way in which legal theory is\nevaluative is that one cannot begin to develop a theory of law without\ndetermining which of its central features are to be accounted for\n(Dickson 2001, 38\u201345). John Finnis, for example, argues that one\ncannot do first-order legal theory without taking a stand on what the\nimportant features of law are that adequate theories must explain\n(e.g., the law\u2019s claim to authority). However, this seems to\nrequire evaluation (Finnis 1980, 9\u201315).\n\n\nNonetheless, it is not likely to be especially controversial that\nlegal theory is evaluative in this way. To see why, distinguish\nbetween (a) thick evaluative claims, which predicate some\nkind of moral goodness, or perhaps all-things-considered value, of an\nitem and (b) thin evaluative claims, which do not. (This\ndistinction roughly tracks Julie Dickson\u2019s distinction between\ndirectly evaluative propositions and indirectly evaluative\npropositions. See Dickson 2001, 51\u201355.) Thus, the simplest thick\nevaluative claims have the form: \\(X\\) is morally\n[all-things-considered] good [bad]. Such claims might also be\ncomparative in nature, such that they have the form: \\(X\\) is\nmorally [all-things-considered] better [worse] than \\(Y\\). By\ncontrast, thin evaluative claims judge how well some item fares\nrelative to a standard that is neither moral nor all-things-considered\nnormative. Such claims do not entail any thick evaluative claims\neither. Examples of thin evaluative claims thus would include\n\u201c\\(X\\) is important\u201d and \u201c\\(X\\) is\ninteresting\u201d. Accordingly, even if legal theorists must make\nthin evaluative claims in order to be able to begin the project of\ndeveloping a first-order legal theory, this does not mean that they\nmust make thick evaluative claims in order to do so. After all, one\nmight construct a theory that captures a range of legal phenomena that\nare deemed central or important, while still remaining agnostic about\nwhether these phenomena are themselves valuable.\n\n\nA third way in which legal theory could in principle be evaluative,\nthough uncontroversially so, is suggested by the prescriptive view\ndiscussed in section 2.1.3. If the job of a first-order theory of law is\nto identify the concept of law it would be most desirable for us to\nemploy, then there is a sense in which the resulting theory of law\nwould of course be evaluative. Nonetheless, as seen above, prescriptive\ntheories aim to answer a different question from theories in the\nconceptual analysis, reductive or interpretive categories. Thus, what\nmatters to the debate about whether legal theory is evaluative is not\nwhether legal theory in principle could be evaluative, but whether it\nis inevitably or necessarily so.\n\n\nNow we are in a position to fully appreciate the question of primary\ninterest here. In particular, it is whether theories about the nature\nof existing legal practice (or perhaps our concept of it) necessarily\ninvolve or entail thick evaluative claims about the law. That\nis, does offering a first-order theory of law of either the conceptual\nanalysis, reductive or constructive interpretation varieties require\none to accept claims about how valuable the law, or some feature of it,\nis? This is the question to be discussed in the remainder of this\nentry.\n2.2.2 Is Legal Theory Evaluative in the Relevant Sense?\n\n\nSome answers to the question that was discussed in section 2.1 suggest that\ntheories of law are inherently evaluative in the sense of committing\nadvocates of these theories to thick evaluative claims about the law.\nAs we will see, this is most plausibly the case on the constructive\ninterpretation view of methodology. By contrast, other answers to the\nquestion discussed in section 2.1 do not obviously entail that\nfirst-order legal theories commit their proponents to thick evaluative\nclaims. In particular, this is the case for the conceptual analysis and\nreductive views of jurisprudential methodology. At least on their face,\nboth these views seem to allow that there can be purely descriptive\naccounts of law\u2014i.e., accounts that capture the central\nfeatures of law without being committed to any moral or\nall-things-considered evaluation of the law. After all, one might think\nthat a particular account does a good job of capturing some widely\nshared concept of law, but this does not obviously commit one to saying\nthat law, on this concept of it, is good. Likewise, one might\nendorse a reduction of legal facts to some more foundational set of\nfacts (e.g., certain social facts) without this committing one\nto thinking that the law is valuable or morally justified.\n\n\nAs a result, at least on their face, both the conceptual analysis\nand reductive views seem to allow that there can be first-order\ntheories of law that are purely descriptive. Some argument would be\nneeded if one is to endorse the opposite conclusion. Accordingly, let\nus consider some prominent arguments for thinking that legal theory\nmust be inherently evaluative in nature. (For an overview, see Marmor\n2011, 122\u201335.)\nThe argument from legal functions\n\n\nOne central argument to the effect that legal theory must be\nevaluative in the relevant sense begins from the idea that\nunderstanding what the law is requires taking a view about\nwhat functions it serves (Finnis 1980, 12\u201317; Perry 1995,\n114\u201320).  Moreover, one might think that functions are\nevaluative in the sense that attributing a function to something is to\nendorse a standard by which that thing may be judged as successful or\nunsuccessful. In this way, one might think that legal theory, too, is\ninherently evaluative.\n\n\nWhile this line of thinking plausibly shows that legal theory requires\naccepting some evaluative claims, it does not obviously show that\nlegal theory necessarily involves thick evaluative claims\n(Dickson 2001, 114\u2013125). Claims of the form \u201cthe function\nof \\(X\\) is \\(F\\)\u201d are naturally classified together with\n\u201c\\(X\\) is important\u201d (or more precisely, \u201c\\(X\\) is\nimportant for some purpose \\(Y\\)\u201d) as thin evaluative\nclaims. Accordingly, asserting that the function of law is \\(F\\) does\nnot obviously entail any thick evaluative claims about law. After all,\nit is not obvious why attributing a function to something requires\nbelieving that performing that function is either\nall-things-considered or morally good.  Thus, attributing a\nfunction to law need not entail any thick evaluative claims.\nThe argument from the internal point of view\n\n\nA second natural argument in favor of seeing legal theory as\ninherently evaluative in the relevant sense relies on the idea that any\nadequate theory of law must take account of the internal point of view\nthat legal practitioners tend to adopt towards the law. More\nspecifically, taking the internal point of view towards the law is a\nmatter of adopting some kind of attitude of endorsement towards it,\nseeing it as in some sense justified or as providing reasons for\naction (Shapiro 2011, 96\u201397; Perry 1995, 99\u2013100;\n see also the entry on \n legal positivism).\n Moreover, it is common to think that a critical mass of the\nparticipants in legal practice must adopt the internal point of view\ntowards the practice in order for the practice to genuinely count as\nlaw. This is a fact that any adequate theory of law must account for,\none might think. Accordingly, since the internal point of view involves\na positive evaluation of the law, and since any adequate legal theory\nmust account for this point of view, one might infer that any adequate\ntheory of law must itself be inherently evaluative. (One finds versions\nof such an argument, e.g., in Perry 1995, 121\u201325; Waldron\n2001, 423\u201328.)\n\n\nIt is unclear whether this argument succeeds, however. After all, it\nseems in principle possible to explain what kinds of considerations\nlegal practitioners endorse, and why, without oneself\nendorsing those considerations. Similarly, a first-order legal theory\nmight be able to plausibly explain the truism that legal practitioners\ntend to take the internal point of view towards (i.e., endorse)\nthe law in their respective jurisdictions without the theory thereby\nbeing committed to the claim that the law in any particular\njurisdiction (or the law in general) is valuable or justified.\nAccordingly, it is not obvious why a theory of law cannot in principle\ncapture the internal point of view taken by legal practitioners towards\nthe law without itself being committed to any thick evaluative claims\nabout the law.\nThe argument from interpretation\n\n\nProbably the most influential argument for thinking that legal theory\nis inherently evaluative proceeds from the idea that legal theory is\nan interpretive endeavor in Dworkin\u2019s sense (Dworkin 1986; for\ncriticism, see Dickson 2001, 105; Marmor 2011, 126\u201330). To say\nthat legal theory is an interpretive project is to claim that fully\nunderstanding what the law is requires construing it as the\nbest instance it can be of the type of thing that it is. Moreover, one\nmight think that in order to construe legal practice as the best\ninstance of the kind of thing that it is requires making thick\nevaluative claims about the law. (See the entry\n on\n legal interpretivism.)\n\n\n\nOne might attempt to respond to this argument in two ways. A\nnatural, though ultimately unsuccessful, reply is that construing\nsomething as the best instance of its kind that it can be does not\nrequire taking that kind to be good. Saying that Bernie Madoff\nwas (for a time) the best fraudster in history does not entail that one\napproves of fraud. As a result, saying that the law must be thus-and-so\nin order to be a good instance of its kind does not commit one to any\nthick evaluative claims. Nonetheless, there is a deeper or more\ninteresting sense in which Dworkin\u2019s view renders legal theory\ninherently evaluative. For Dworkin, legal theory is an interpretive\nenterprise, and offering a constructive interpretation of legal\npractice requires construing it in its best moral light. Thus,\noffering an interpretation of legal practice would require taking a\nstand on which of the available ways of construing that practice is\nmorally better than the others. Of course, this does not necessarily\nrequire asserting that the law, on any particular construal, is\ngood\u2014full stop. But it does seem to require at least\nsaying that some construals of legal practice are morally\nbetter than other construals would be. This looks to be a\nthick evaluative claim, albeit a comparative one. Moreover, one cannot\nmake such comparative judgments without having a view about what would\nmake one construal of legal practice morally better than another. Thus,\nin at least this sense, taking legal theory to be an endeavor that is\ninterpretive in Dworkin\u2019s sense would make legal theory count as\ninherently evaluative in the sense we are concerned with here.\n\n\nAccordingly, if one wants to maintain the possibility of purely\ndescriptive first-order legal theories, a more promising strategy for\nresponding to the argument from interpretation would be to question its\nkey premise\u2014viz., that legal theory necessarily is an\ninterpretive endeavor in Dworkin\u2019s sense. In order for a\nproponent of the argument from interpretation to assert this premise,\nsome rationale would have to be given for it. That is, some argument\nwould be needed to explain why we should think that\nunderstanding law requires giving a constructive\ninterpretation of it. A critic of the argument from interpretation,\nthen, might claim that the argument\u2019s proponents have not carried\ntheir burden of providing a rationale for this premise, on which the\nargument crucially depends.\n\n\nOne possible rationale that might be offered here is that since\nsocial practices essentially involve communication, and understanding\nany form of communication necessarily involves interpreting\nspeakers\u2019 claims, understanding the social practice of law\nnecessarily involves interpreting it. However, this rationale is too\nquick. Even if it is true that understanding any social practice\nrequires interpretation of some kind or other, it does not\nfollow that doing so requires a constructive interpretation in\nDworkin\u2019s sense\u2014i.e., identifying a construal\nof the practice that casts it in its best moral light (Marmor 2011,\n127\u201328). But the latter claim, of course, is what proponents of the\nargument from interpretation need to establish in order to reach their\ndesired conclusion that legal theory is inherently evaluative.\n\n\nAccordingly, we seem to be left in the following dialectical\nsituation. Whether or not legal theory is inherently evaluative in the\nrelevant sense depends on whether the argument from interpretation\nsucceeds. Whether that argument succeeds, in turn, depends on its key\npremise, i.e., the claim that understanding the law necessarily\nrequires giving a constructive interpretation of it. If a\nnon-question begging argument can be given for this claim, then there\nwould be reason to think that legal theory necessarily is evaluative in\nnature. By contrast, if no non-question begging argument can be given\nfor thinking that understanding law requires a constructive\ninterpretation, then one would be free to maintain that there can be\npurely descriptive first-order legal theories.\n\n\nOf course, even if the argument from interpretation fails and purely\ndescriptive legal theories remain possible, it could still be\na worthwhile project to attempt to give a constructive interpretation\nof legal practice, and the output of this project would indeed be a\npartially evaluative theory. Nonetheless, these two types of theory\nwould not genuinely be in conflict, as they would be addressed to\nanswering different questions. In the end, therefore,\n\u201cmethodological pluralism\u201d may be the most apt\ncharacterization of the state of play in jurisprudence.",
