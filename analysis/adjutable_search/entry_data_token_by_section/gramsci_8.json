For him,\nthe complete absence of political leadership from the PSI had\nundermined the occupations\u2019 revolutionary potential. With the\nformation of the PCd\u2019I, he committed to a hierarchical,\ncentralized leadership and strict ideological discipline via a\nBolshevik model of the revolutionary party. This new position was,\narguably, less a wholesale volte face than a realization that\nthe PSI was culturally and organizationally incapable of responding to\nthe situation. Indeed, his understanding of the party\u2019s role\ncontinued to evolve thereafter. Nonetheless, his thinking from here\nonwards remained within a \u201cLeninist\u201d frame of reference\nconcerning revolutionary leadership, tactics, and organization.\n\nWhat is notable about Gramsci\u2019s writings on party strategy in\nthe period 1921\u201326 is not that they offer a coherent or novel\npolitical theory but, rather, that they show he was developing an\nindependent position that echoed fragments of his earlier thinking.\nThis involved: the rejection of \u201cformalistic\u201d reasoning\nthat neglected specific historical conditions; attention to the\nItalian social structure and the distinctive, cultural-political role\nof \u201cintellectuals\u201d; and the necessity of a mass-based\nparty that incorporated the southern peasantry. These topics were\ncentral points of reference in Gramsci\u2019s mature thinking about\nhegemony in the Notebooks.\n\nFor Gramsci, the critique of formalism underscored his growing concern\nthat the new party wasn\u2019t reading the \u201cobjective\nsituation\u201d but, rather, imposing a rigid view\n\u201cdeduced\u201d from abstract principle (SPWII: 360). The\nsurprising success of fascism in mobilizing part of the populace\nagainst the proletariat revealed just how intellectually and\npolitically unprepared communists had been. Gramsci now began to\nunderline the view that the received model of revolution\u2014a\nviolent seizure of power in the midst of a catastrophic\ncrisis\u2014needed to be adapted to conditions that had not applied\nin Russia. As he noted in September 1926:\n\n\nin the advanced capitalist countries, the ruling class possesses\npolitical and organizational reserves which it did not possess, for\ninstance, in Russia. (SPWII: 408)\n\n\nEconomic crises did not lead automatically to political instability\nbecause forces could be found to support the regime. In peripheral\nstates like Italy\u2019s, he observed, \u201ca broad stratum of\nintermediary classes\u201d\u2014middle classes of various\nkinds\u2014influenced the proletariat and the peasantry, steering\nthem away from revolution.\n\nIn his notes on the \u201cSouthern Question\u201d, written just\nprior to his arrest, Gramsci also explored the neglected problem of\nItaly\u2019s South, which he described as \u201ca great social\ndisintegration\u201d (SPWII: 454). He noted the influence of southern\nintellectuals, such as Benedetto Croce and Giustino Fortunato, in\nideologically legitimating the liberal regime. Croce, especially, had\nperformed a \u201cnational function\u201d by endorsing liberalism,\nhelping to prevent radical southern intellectuals from joining with\npeasants in opposition to the conservative agrarian bloc. Although he\nbelieved it unlikely in the short term, Gramsci argued the PCd\u2019I\nneeded to develop its own supporting intellectuals if it was to\nundertake an inclusive national strategy to overcome the agrarian\nbloc.\n\nEven within the constrained horizons of communist politics, then,\nGramsci was beginning to pose the question of revolution on a\ndifferent plane than others in the movement. The unplanned\ninterruption brought by his arrest and imprisonment permitted him to\nexplore many of these issues in much greater depth.\n",
