    "main_text": "An Anti-Meinongian First-Order View\n4. Conclusion\n\nThis entry began by noting that existence raises a number of deep and\nimportant problems in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and\nphilosophical logic. The entry has examined some of those problems and\nsurveyed a number of different accounts of existence. None of the\ntheories surveyed is wholly satisfying and without cost. The first\nview proposed by Frege and Russell treats existence as a second-order\nproperty and assimilates seemingly singular existentials to general\nexistentials.  The proposal requires descriptivism, the thesis that\nordinary proper names have descriptive equivalences, which many find\nto be a problematic thesis. The second Meinongian view requires\ncountenancing individuals that do not exist. We have seen the view\nface challenges in giving coherent and yet informative and compelling\nindividuation principles for nonexistent individuals and all versions\nof the view suffer from the problem of metaphysical\noverpopulation. Finally, the naive view that existence is a universal\nproperty of individuals was presented. That view faced the problem of\nhaving to reject the truth of highly intuitively true singular\nnegative existential sentences like \u2018Ronald McDonald does not\nexist\u2019. The view also faces difficulties in properly accounting\nfor the interaction of quantifiers and modal and tense\noperators. Existence remains, then, itself a serious problem in\nphilosophy of language, metaphysics, and logic and one connected to\nsome of the deepest and most important problems in those areas.\n",
