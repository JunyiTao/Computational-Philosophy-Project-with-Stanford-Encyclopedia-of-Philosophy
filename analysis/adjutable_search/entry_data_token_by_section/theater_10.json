    "main_text": "Evaluating a Theatrical Performance || Aesthetic and Artistic Evaluations\n4.3 Achievements in Theater\n\nA given piece of literary writing \u201cfor the stage\u201d may be\neither a work of dramatic literature or a script, either a writing to\nbe read for certain literary features and values or a writing to be\nused in a quite different way. That a bit of writing functions as a\nwork of dramatic literature does not alter the fact that the\nrelevant effects, features, and values to be analyzed and examined are\nexactly those that are analyzed and examined with respect to any other\nnarrative literary work. Crucially, a work of dramatic literature does\nnot require theatrical performance for the realization of those\neffects, features, or values (Worthen 2007, Hamilton 2009b).\n\nThis way of construing writing \u201cfor the stage\u201d does not\npreclude what may be called a \u201cliterary theater\u201d. If we\nthink of scripts as \u201cscores for action\u201d (Saltz 1991b), we\nmay also think of them as providing particular orderings of the\ninformation an audience will encounter (Stoppard 1999). Some scripts\ndo this to excellent effect; in theater parlance, they \u201chave\nlegs\u201d. Like some gymnastic or jazz routines, they are frequently\nrepeated and approximated because they yield performances that mark\ngreat achievements. Writing may contribute to this achievement for\ntheater because it allows greater control over the flow and order of\ninformation than do complex scenarios crafted for improvisational\nsequences or even than do scenarios and language passed down from\nperformer to performer over generations. Whatever the case may be with\nrespect to the value of scripted performances over performances\ngenerated in other ways, however, a script driven theater is likely to\nbe a literary theater simply because it will produce some written\nscripts that can\u2014indeed will\u2014also be taken to function as\nworks of literature.\n\nLiterary analyses of a work of dramatic literature that happens to get\nused as a script may or may not be useful for performers. The content\nof a theatrical performance is not fully governed, deliverable, nor\nretrievable by a written text. Texts\u2014which are relatively\n\u201cthin\u201d\u2014are underdetermined by performances (Ball\n1983; Worthen 2007, but see Goodman 1968: 210\u2013211 for a contrary\nview). If this is right, a quite different set of standards for\nmeasuring the achievements of performances, per se, is\nrequired.\n\nAs of this date, very little progress has been made in philosophy on\nwhat those particular standards might be. And perhaps that debate is\nbest left to practicing critics, performers, and performance or\ntheater theorists. But some philosophical headway can be made by\nconsidering what is required for assessing the achievements of\nperformances.\n\nTo ask what achievements are possible in theatrical performances\nrequires that we understand what an achievement is in the first place.\nOne source of thinking about this will certainly come from empirical\nwork on achievements in education\u2014correlating them with other\nfactors, but not specifying what achievement, per se,\nconsists in (for example, Burke and Sass 2013). Another source will\nundoubtedly come from those concerned with \n virtue epistemology,\n virtue ethics, or perhaps perfectionist\n accounts of value. Gwen Bradford has examined the basic idea of\n\u201cachievements\u201d in several publications (Bradford 2013,\n2015, 2016). Bradford describes achievements as requiring two\nthings:\n\n\nFirst, achievements are characterized by a process-product structure:\nall achievements have a process, which culminates in a\nproduct. Second, the process of an achievement is\ndifficult. Something must be difficult to some sufficient\ndegree in order to be an achievement; after all, if running a marathon\nand writing a novel were easy, we wouldn\u2019t be inclined to call\nthem achievements. \u2026[and] for now we will suppose that an\nactivity is difficult just in case it requires effort from the agent\nengaging in the activity. (Bradford 2013: 205)\n\n\nShe ultimately denies that it might make a difference if the product\nis independently valuable, on the grounds that at least as a matter of\ncodifying our everyday assessments of achievement we do count\nthings\u2014running a marathon, scoring well on an\nexamination\u2014as achievements even though they have less\nindependent value than, say, saving thirty lives from otherwise\ncertain death by fire, or finding a cure for polio (Bradford 2016:\n797). Accordingly, if one is to mark achievements in theatrical\nperformance, one must state clearly what the process of preparing a\nperformance involves, why the tasks undertaken in that process are not\neasy, and how these achievements are to be noticed and assessed.\n\nIn preparing and performing a routine, performers make choices\nabout what to utter and what to do. Performers also\nchoose how to utter what is uttered and how to do\nwhatever it is they do. And, performers determine what to do and how\nto do it for every moment of the performance. These\ndecisions, so far, concern what each performer utters and does\nindependently of other performers, but performers usually do not make\neven these decisions in isolation from each other. Another aspect of\nthese decisions requires concerted, perhaps collective, effort. Any\ncompany needs to decide where they wish to direct attention at each\nmoment and how they will do that. Some of those decisions involve\nthinking about such things as how performers are situated relative to\neach other and to the audience in the performance space. Many\ndecisions that determine how attention gets directed involve deciding\nthe manner and timing of each performer's utterances in relation to\nthe content, manner, and timing of the utterances of other performers.\nSimilarly, to regulate the attention of audiences, companies think\nabout how what each performer is doing relates to what the other\nperformers are\n doing.[2]\n Clearly, none of these tasks, especially the ones demanding\ncoordination among the performers, is particularly easy.\n\nBeyond this, spectators must be able to determine the style in which a\nperformance occurs in order to be guided to relevantly correct\nexpectations. Consequently, performers must make stylistic choices as\nwell. For it is actually sequences of features (resulting from\nsequences of choices) that give shape to a performance over time and\nguide spectators\u2019 expectations. This will be so if the sequence\nis a convention governed by some overall goal the performers have. And\nagain, none of these tasks, especially since stylistic choices demand\ncoordination among the performers, is particularly easy to succeed\n at.[3]\n\nThis leads to a set of ideas about how spectators measure success and,\nin particular, what they are able to say about performers, sets, and\noverall mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, when they detect\nfailures. If a spectator is unaware of a convention\u2014a\nsequence of choices governed by some overall goal\u2014as a\nconvention, and if the presence of that convention is responsible for\nthe aspects of the work that are present to be appreciated, then that\nspectator simply cannot appreciate that work, at least not for those\naspects. This is partly because appreciation depends on having some\nlevel of understanding of what one is experiencing. Understanding\nrequires spectators to offer hypotheses regarding what performers are\nup to in a performance, to test those hypotheses against the actual\ndetails of the performance, usually as it unfolds, and to assess the\nachievement the performance manifests given its aims and its context.\nOnly spectators who understand performances and their features are\nable to offer the relevant kinds of hypotheses.\n\nSuch spectators are able to detect and explain failures of skill. A\nsuitably backgrounded spectator who thereby understands the\nconventions and styles in play will know what to watch for. A\nperformer will fail who does not exhibit the relevant features in\nvoice, speech, mood, movement, or action. Such a failure may be a\nresult of lack of skill. A spectator who understands performances and\ntheir features will not only notice this but will also be able to\nexplain this failure due to lack of skill to other spectators.\n\nAt the level of style, failures in performance can occur in at least\nthree ways. They can occur if some of the features grouped together\ninto conventions do not clearly and coherently induce the\neffects\u2014the goals\u2014at which they appear to be aimed. Or they may\noccur if the performers do not understand what effects the conventions\nthey have adopted actually induce and, so, have made choices quite at\nodds with their own self-conscious aims. They may also occur if the\naims of the performers are unclear and they have selected a mix of\nconventions that is confusing to an audience. If a spectator is\ntracking the adequacy of hypothesis about what performers are doing\nand she understands performances and their features, she will notice\nthese failures and be able to explain them to others as well.\n\nThese are the basic achievements a theatrical performance aims at; and\nthese are the kinds of successes and failures that some audience members detect.\nArtistic evaluations of theatrical performances qua\nperformances are determinations that achievements of these sorts are\nmade or not made.\n",
