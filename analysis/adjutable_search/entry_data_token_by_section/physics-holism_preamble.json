    "main_text": "\n\nIt has sometimes been suggested that quantum phenomena exhibit a\ncharacteristic holism or nonseparability, and that this distinguishes\nquantum from classical physics. One puzzling quantum phenomenon arises\nwhen one performs measurements on certain separated quantum systems.\nThe results of some such measurements regularly exhibit patterns of\nstatistical correlation that resist traditional causal explanation.\nSome have held that it is possible to understand these patterns as\ninstances or consequences of quantum holism or nonseparability. Just\nwhat holism and nonseparability are supposed to be has not always been\nmade clear, though, and each of these notions has been understood in\ndifferent ways. Moreover, while some have taken holism and\nnonseparability to come to the same thing, others have thought it\nimportant to distinguish the two. Any evaluation of the significance\nof quantum holism and/or nonseparability must rest on a careful\nanalysis of these notions and their physical applications.\n",
