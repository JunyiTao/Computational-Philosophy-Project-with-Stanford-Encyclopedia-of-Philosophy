    "main_text": "Philosophical Aspects of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Logic || Quantification\n4.4 Quantification\n\n \nMuch has been written about the way in which Le\u015bniewski\nunderstood the quantifiers \u2018for some\u2019 \\((\\exists)\\) and\n\u2018for all\u2019 \\((\\forall)\\). There are three aspects to the\ncontroversy: (1) how the quantifiers are to be read; (2) how they are\nto be understood; and (3) the logical and philosophical significance\nof the way they are understood. The controversy arose principally\nbecause of a discrepancy between the way in which Le\u015bniewski and\nLe\u015bniewskians take the quantifiers to mean, and the orthodox way\nof understanding them, as formulated in particular by Quine.\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s student Lejewski recounts how after moving from\nPoland to Britain he was surprised to find that the local (Quinean)\nunderstanding was very different from the one he had grown up\nwith. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that Le\u015bniewski did\nnot produce or even envisage a semantics for his logic, considering,\nas had Frege and Russell, that his system was already meaningful and\nhad no need of a semantics to be grafted onto it from\noutside. Historically it is interesting that Quine\u2019s preoccupation\nwith the idea of ontological commitment and its connection to\nquantification and its domain, go back to discussions he had with\nLe\u015bniewski when he visited Warsaw in 1933. Quine relates that he\nand Le\u015bniewski stayed up until late at night disputing whether\nthe use of higher-order variables committed Le\u015bniewski to\nplatonic objects, as Quine thought, or not, as Le\u015bniewski\nthought. Obviously to a nominalist like Le\u015bniewski the thought\nthat his cherished system should involve him in unwanted ontological\ncommitments would be most repugnant.\n\n As to the reading of the quantifiers, while we note that in his\npre-symbolic writings Le\u015bniewski favored expressions like\n\u201cfor some meaning of the expression \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019\n\u201d and \u201cfor every meaning of the expression\n\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 \u201d, which may give us a hint as to how\nhe understood quantification, he later preferred the unadorned\n\u2018for some\u2019 and \u2018for all\u2019, followed by the\nrelevant variables, and it seems sensible simply to follow this.\n\n The meaning or interpretation of the quantifiers is a more subtle\nquestion. It seems very likely that Le\u015bniewski thought of the\nquantifiers as a notational necessity when a domain could be infinite,\nsince infinite disjunctions and conjunctions were not possible. In\nProtothetic, as its computational variant makes clear, there is\nstrictly no need for quantifiers, since each semantic category, no\nmatter how high in the hierarchy, has only finitely many possible\n(extensional) values. But in Ontology, where there is no logical\nrequirement that the domain of individuals be finite, the quantifiers\nare indispensable. One thing for sure is that they cannot be given an\nexistentially committed reading, where \u2018for some\u2019 means\n\u2018there exists\u2019. The reason is that the laws of\nquantification and the definability in Ontology of a necessarily empty\nterm \u2018\\(\\Lambda\\)\u2019, for which it is true that no \\(\\Lambda\\)\nexists, entail the truth of the quantified proposition \u2018for\nsome \\(a\\), no \\(a\\) exists\u2019 (cf. T.127 of\n\u201cDefinitions and Theses of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Ontology\u201d\nin S. Lesniewski\u2019s Lecture Notes in Logic). This would be\ncontradictory if \u2018for some\u2019 meant \u2018there\nexists\u2019. Le\u015bniewski always used the expression\n\u2018particular quantifier\u2019 rather than \u2018existential\nquantifier\u2019. So the question is how the quantifiers are to be\nunderstood if not in the standard way.\n\n Quine took from his discussions with Le\u015bniewski the idea that\nthe quantifiers were somehow substitutional. There is an element of\ntruth in this. A universally quantified formula\n\\(\\forall X\\ldots \\ulcorner\\)\u2014\\(X\\)\u2014\\(\\urcorner\\)\nlicenses the inference to any formula \u2014\\(C\\)\u2014\nobtained by substituting any well-formed expression \\(C\\) of the\nappropriate category in place of the bound variable \\(X\\), and\nlikewise for all the other variables occurring bound by the same\nquantifier. Dually, from \u2014\\(C\\)\u2014 one may infer\n\\(\\exists X\\ldots \\ulcorner\\)\u2014\\(X\\)\u2014\\(\\urcorner\\) for\nsuitable categories of bound variable. These are the usual quantifier\nrules, liberalized to apply to any categories of variable in batches\nof one or more. So for example if there is a theorem universally\nquantifying nominal variables, such as\n\u2018\\(\\forall a\\ulcorner\\)any \\(a\\) is an\n\\(a\\urcorner\\)\u2019, we can validly infer \u2018any \\(\\Lambda\\) is a\n\\(\\Lambda\\)\u2019 even though the name is empty. Quine assumed that the\nlack of ontological commitment must entail that the quantifiers range\nover expressions rather than things. This would not have been\nacceptable to Le\u015bniewski, because it would constitute use/mention\nconfusion, and because while it is true for the nominalist that there\nare only finitely many expressions, it is not known to be true, and\nmay in fact be false, that there are only finitely many things.\n\n Is there then a third way to understand the quantifiers that is\nneither referential nor substitutional? Such a way has been suggested\nby Guido K\u00fcng, based on the young Le\u015bniewski\u2019s reading of\nthe quantifiers as \u201cfor all [some] meanings of the variable\n\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 \u201d. Take this preamble to be what\nK\u00fcng calls a prologue functor, which mentions\nthe expression \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019, but takes its matrix (the part\nafter the quantifier, within the upper corners) to be a context of\nuse of the variable, and takes the variables to range over\nmeanings, in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s case, extensions (K\u00fcng 1977).\nAgain there is something right and something wrong about this. If\nextensions are (as standardly understood) various kinds of sets,\nnothing could be more abhorrent to Le\u015bniewski. He laid great\nstore on logic\nnot being committed to the existence of anything, being\nontologically neutral: no existence statement is a theorem of\nany of his systems. So to have found that after all he is committed, by\nthe back door as it were, to the hated sets, would have been a bitter\nblow. The correct insight of this understanding is that neither objects\nnor expressions are what quantifier expressions range over. They do\nnot range over extensions either: they do not range over\nanything. But for each category of expression there are numerous ways\nin which an expression of that category can mean. A sentence can be\ntrue or it can be false. A name can name one thing, or several\nthings, all things, or no things at all. Functor expressions mean\naccording to the way the outputs of their combinations mean when\ntheir inputs have certain meanings. Given a domain of individuals, in\nprinciple all possible ways of meaning are delimited for all categories\nof expression. Quantifiers tap into this potentiality. But it goes\nagainst the nominalist grain of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s thought to\nreify all the different potential ways an expression could mean as if\nthese were additional objects. So when Le\u015bniewski told Quine his\nuse of quantified variables in categories other than names did not\ncommit him to platonic objects, he was being truthful. What he was\ncommitted to, from the moment he accepted bivalence of truth and\nfalsity onwards, was that expressions of the various categories may be\nvariously meaningful.\n",
