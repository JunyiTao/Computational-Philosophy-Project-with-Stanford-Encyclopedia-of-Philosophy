    "main_text": "The Nature of the Evolutionary Unit Homo sapiens and its Specimens || The Nature of the Species Taxon\n2.1 The Nature of the Species Taxon\n\nThe theory of evolution transforms the way we should understand the\nrelationship between human organisms and the species to which they\nbelong. The taxonomic assumption of TP5 was that species are\nindividuated by means of intrinsic properties that are individually\ninstantiated by certain organisms. Instantiating those properties is\ntaken to be necessary and sufficient for those organisms to belong to\nthe species. Evolutionary theory makes it clear that species, as\npopulation-level entities, cannot be individuated by means of the\nproperties of lower-level constituents, in our case, of individual\nhuman organisms (Sober 1980: 355).\n\nThe exclusion of this possibility grounds a decisive difference from\nthe way natural kinds are standardly construed in the wake of Locke\nand Kripke. Recall that, in this Kripkean construal, lumps of matter\nare instances of chemical kinds because of their satisfaction of\nintrinsic necessary and sufficient conditions, viz. their atoms\npossessing a certain number of protons. The same conditions also\nindividuate the chemical kinds themselves. Chemical kinds are thus\nspatiotemporally unrestricted sets. This means that there are no\nmetaphysical barriers to the chance generation of members of the kind,\nindependently of whether the kind is instantiated at any contiguous\ntime or place. Nitrogen could come to exist by metaphysical\nhappenstance, should an element with the atomic number 14 somehow come\ninto being, even in a world in which up to that point no nitrogen has\nexisted (Hull 1978: 349; 1984: 22).\n\nIn contrast, a species can only exist at time \\(t_n\\) if either it or\na parent species existed at \\(t_{n-1}\\) and there was some\nrelationship of spatial contiguity between component individuals of\nthe species at \\(t_n\\) and the individuals belonging to either the\nsame species or the parent species at \\(t_{n-1}\\). This is because of\nthe essential role of the causal relationship of heredity. Heredity\ngenerates both the coherence across a population requisite for the\nexistence of a species and the variability of predominant traits\nwithin the population, without which a species would not evolve.\n\nFor this reason, the species Homo sapiens, like every other\nspecies taxon, must meet a historical or genealogical condition. (For\npluralistic objections to even this condition, see Kitcher 1984:\n320ff.; Dupr\u00e9 1993: 49f.) This condition is best expressed as a\nsegment of a population-level phylogenetic tree, where such trees\nrepresent ancestor-descendent series (Hull 1978: 349; de Queiroz 1999:\n50ff.; 2005). Species, as the point is often put, are historical\nentities, rather than kinds or classes (Hull 1978: 338ff.; 1984: 19).\nThe fact that species are not only temporally, but also spatially\nrestricted has also led to the stronger claim that they are\nindividuals (Ghiselin 1974; 1997: 14ff.; Hull 1978: 338). If this is\ncorrect, then organisms are not members, but parts of species\ntaxa. Independently of whether this claim is true for all biological\nspecies, Homo sapiens is a good candidate for a species that\nbelongs to the category individual. This is because the\nspecies is characterised not only by spatiotemporal continuity, but\nalso by causal processes that account for the coherence between its\ncomponent parts. These processes plausibly include not only\ninterbreeding, but also conspecific recognition and particular forms\nof communication (Richards 2010: 158ff., 218).\n\nImportantly, the genealogical condition is only a necessary condition,\nas genealogy unites all the segments of one lineage. The segment of\nthe phylogenetic tree that represents some species taxon begins with a\nnode that represents a lineage-splitting or speciation event.\nDetermining that node requires attention to general speciation theory,\nwhich has proposed various competing criteria (Dupr\u00e9 1993:\n48f.; Okasha 2002: 201; Coyne & Orr 2004). In the case of Homo\nsapiens, it requires attention to the specifics of the human\ncase, which are also controversial (see Crow 2003; Cela-Conde &\nAyala 2017: 11ff.). The end point of the segment is marked either by\nsome further speciation event or, as may seem likely in the case of\nHomo sapiens, by the destruction of the metapopulation. Only\nwhen the temporal boundaries of the segment have become determinate\nwould it be possible to adduce sufficient conditions for the existence\nof such a historical entity. Hence, if \u201chuman nature\u201d is\nunderstood to pick out the necessary and sufficient conditions that\nindividuate the species taxon Homo sapiens, its content is\nnot only controversial, but epistemically unavailable to us.\n",
