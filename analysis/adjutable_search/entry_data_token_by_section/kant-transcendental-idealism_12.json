    "main_text": "Kant as a Phenomenalist || The Problem of Things in Themselves\n3.4 The Problem of Things in Themselves\n\nNo discussion of Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism would be\ncomplete without a discussion of F.H. Jacobi\u2019s famous objection\nto the critique:\n\n\nwithout the presupposition of the [thing in itself] I cannot enter the\n[critical] system, and with that presupposition I cannot remain in it.\n(Jacobi, Werke, vol. II, p. 304)\n\n\nJacobi is referring to a number of quite serious problems for\nKant\u2019s transcendental idealist theory. They do not disappear on\nother interpretations, but they are especially serious for the\ntraditional phenomenalist reading. Unlike the problems we discussed\nearlier, however, which were specifically problems for the\nphenomenalist analysis of appearances, these problems, as\nJacobi indicates, concern the thing in itself, and the relation\nbetween things in themselves and appearances.\n3.4.1 The Unknowability of Things in Themselves\n\nKant is committed to both of the following theses:\n\n(Existence) There are things in themselves.\n\n(Humility) We know nothing about things in themselves.\n\nWhile these are not, strictly speaking, incompatible, they are in\ntension, for Humility appears to remove any warrant Kant\nmight have for asserting Existence.\n\nBut it gets worse for the traditional view. Kant does not merely claim\nthat things in themselves exist, he also asserts that,\n\n(Non-spatiality) Things in themselves are not in space and\ntime.\n\n(Affection) Things in themselves causally affect\n us.[31]\n\nMany of Kant\u2019s early readers concluded that Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy is inconsistent: he claims that we cannot know the very\nassertions he makes about things in themselves. Kant\u2019s own\ntheory renders itself\n unknowable.[32]\n\nIt would be over-hasty to suggest that each of these three\nproblems\u2014how to square Humility, with Non-Spatiality, Affection,\nand Existence\u2014are on a par. Since Non-spatiality makes only a\nnegative claim, it may be easier to make it consistent with Humility.\nFor instance, at B149 Kant writes:\n\n\nit is not yet a genuine cognition if I merely indicate what the\nintuition of the object is not, without being able to say\nwhat is then contained in it.\n\n\nThis suggests that, while Kant\u2019s usually unqualified statements\nof our ignorance of things in themselves (they are \u201cnot cognized\nat all\u201d A30/B45), his considered view might be more qualified:\nwe know nothing of the positive properties of things in\n themselves.[33]\n But Affection looks especially difficult to square with\nHumility (see Hogan 2009 and Stang 2013).\n3.4.2 Things in themselves as causes\n\nThe issue of things in themselves affecting us raises another\nproblem for Kant\u2019s theory, for Kant also argues that categories\nlike cause-effect cannot be meaningfully applied to things in\nthemselves. Without an intuition \u201c[the category] has no sense,\nand is entirely empty of content\u201d (A239/B298). Since things in\nthemselves cannot be intuited, categories (including\ncause-effect) have no sense or content when applied to things\nin themselves. Jacobi and others thought this was yet another\ninconsistency in Kant\u2019s philosophy: he denies that categories\ncan be applied to things in themselves, but then he applies the\ncategory cause-effect to them!\n\nHowever, one has to be careful in interpreting Kant\u2019s denial of\n\u201csense\u201d or \u201cmeaning\u201d to categories as applied\nto things in themselves. It is tempting to read this as meaning that\nthe thought of things in themselves falling under categories is\nliterally nonsense, but there is textual evidence that Kant is making\na weaker point: thinking of things in themselves under the categories\nhas no cognitive sense, i.e., in making such judgments we do\nnot cognize anything. For instance,\n\n\n[\u2026] the categories are not restricted in\nthinking by the conditions of our sensible intuition,\nbut have an unbounded field, and only the cognition\nof objects that we think, the determination of the object, requires\nintuition; in the absence of the latter, the thought of the object can\nstill have its true and useful consequences for the\nuse of reason [\u2026]\n (B166n)[34]\n\n\nWe can think of any objects whatsoever using the categories. In fact,\nthis is unavoidable; the categories are the most basic concepts of\nobjects in general, so we cannot think about anything whatsoever\nwithout using some categories to do so. But in thinking about the\nthings in themselves using categories we do not thereby (a)\nknow that there are things in themselves falling under the categories\nor (b) even that it is possible for there to be things in\nthemselves falling under the categories. The strongest form of\nJacobi\u2019s objection\u2014that Kant\u2019s view entails that the\ncategories cannot be applied, even in thought, to things in\nthemselves\u2014may rest on a misunderstanding (cf. Van Cleve 1999:\n137; Adams 1997: 820\u20131). This still leaves, though, the pressing\nproblem of how, given Kant\u2019s Humility doctrine, he could have\nany epistemic warrant for making the various substantive claims he\ndoes about things in themselves (Existence, Non-spatiality,\nAffection).\n3.4.3 The Problem of Affection\n\nJacobi raises yet another problem about Kant\u2019s theory of\nexperience. He notes Kant\u2019s definition of sensibility as the\ncapacity \u201cto receive representations through the manner in which\nwe are affected by objects\u201d (A19/B33) and poses a dilemma: are\nthe objects that affect our sensibility appearances or things in\nthemselves? They cannot be things in themselves, Jacobi argues,\nbecause that would involve applying the categories to things in\nthemselves. And they cannot be appearances, because appearances exist\nin virtue of the very experiences they are (allegedly) causing. He\nconcludes that Kant\u2019s system is inconsistent (Jacobi,\nWerke, vol. II, 291\u2013310; Fichte raises the same\nobjection in the Second Introduction to the\nWissenschaftslehre; cf. Fichte, Werke I, 488).\n\nWe have already discussed the argument of the first horn of\nJacobi\u2019s dilemma: we can think but not know that things\nin themselves causally affect us. But what about the second horn? Hans\nVaihinger concisely explains Jacobi\u2019s argument:\n\n\nOr one understands by affecting objects the objects in space; but\nsince these are only appearances according to Kant, and thus our\nrepresentations, one falls into the contradiction that the same\nappearances, which we first have on the basis of affection, should be\nthe source of that very affection. (Vaihinger 1881: vol. 2, p. 53)\n\n\n\u201cFirst\u201d here does not refer to temporal priority, but to\nmetaphysical priority: if p is true in virtue of q,\nthen q is \u201cprior\u201d to p. Jacobi and\nVaihinger assume that appearances exist in virtue of the contents of\nour experience of them:\n\n(Trans. Idealism) If x is an appearance, then\nx exists in virtue of the fact that subjects experience\nx.\n\nIf we are empirically affected, though, it follows that:\n\n(Empirical affection) For some x, x is one\nof the causes of subjects\u2019 experience of x.\n\nFor instance, this computer is one of the causes of my current\nexperience of it. But these assumptions are inconsistent if we assume\nthe following plausible principle:\n\n(Exclusion) If x exists in virtue of the fact that\np, then x cannot be even a partial cause of the fact\nthat p.\n\nIntuitively, this principle says that no object can be even a partial\ncause of the very fact in virtue of which it exists; if it were, it\nwould be a partial cause of its own existence. In the context of\nKant\u2019s theory of experience, it means that appearances cannot\n\u201creach back\u201d and cause the very experiences in virtue of\nwhich they exist. From the 1780s until today, many have taken this\nproblem to be fatal to Kant\u2019s theory of\n experience.[35]\n",
