    "main_text": "Regress Objections to LOTH || Learning a Language\n6.1 Learning a Language\n\nLike many cognitive scientists, Fodor holds that children learn a\nnatural language via hypothesis formation and testing.\nChildren formulate, test, and confirm hypotheses about the denotations\nof words. For example, a child learning English will confirm the\nhypothesis that \u201ccat\u201d denotes cats. According to Fodor,\ndenotations are represented in Mentalese. To formulate the hypothesis\nthat \u201ccat\u201d denotes cats, the child uses a Mentalese word\ncat that denotes cats. It may seem that a\nregress is now in the offing, sparked by the question: How does the\nchild learn Mentalese? Suppose we extend the hypothesis formation and\ntesting model (henceforth HF) to Mentalese. Then we must posit a\nmeta-language to express hypotheses about denotations of Mentalese\nwords, a meta-meta-language to express hypotheses about denotations of\nmeta-language words, and so on ad infinitum (Atherton and\nSchwartz 1974: 163).\n\nFodor responds to the threatened regress by denying we should apply HF\nto Mentalese (1975: 65). Children do not test hypotheses about the\ndenotations of Mentalese words. They do not learn Mentalese at all.\nThe mental language is innate.\n\nThe doctrine that some concepts are innate was a focal point\nin the clash between rationalism versus empiricism. Rationalists\ndefended the innateness of certain fundamental ideas, such as \ngod\nand cause, while\nempiricists held that all ideas derive from sensory experience. A\nmajor theme in the 1960s cognitive science revolution was revival of a\nnativist picture, inspired by the rationalists, on which many\nkey elements of cognition are innate. Most famously, Chomsky (1965)\nexplained language acquisition by positing innate knowledge about\npossible human languages. Fodor\u2019s innateness thesis was widely\nperceived as going way beyond all precedent, verging on the\npreposterous (P.S. Churchland 1986; Putnam 1988). How could we have an\ninnate ability to represent all the denotations we mentally represent?\nFor example, how could we innately possess a Mentalese word \ncarburetor\nthat represents carburetors?\n\nIn evaluating these issues, it is vital to distinguish between\nlearning a concept versus acquiring a concept. When\nFodor says that a concept is innate, he does not mean to deny that we\nacquire the concept or even that certain kinds of experience are\nneeded to acquire it. Fodor fully grants that we cannot mentally\nrepresent carburetors at birth and that we come to represent them only\nby undergoing appropriate experiences. He agrees that most concepts\nare acquired. He denies that they are learned. In\neffect, he uses \u201cinnate\u201d as a synonym for\n\u201cunlearned\u201d (1975: 96). One might reasonably challenge\nFodor\u2019s usage. One might resist classifying a concept as innate\nsimply because it is unlearned. However, that is how Fodor\nuses the word \u201cinnate\u201d. Properly understood, then,\nFodor\u2019s position is not as far-fetched as it may\n sound.[7]\n\nFodor gives a simple but striking argument that concepts are\nunlearned. The argument begins from the premise that HF is the only\npotentially viable model of concept learning. Fodor then\nargues that HF is not a viable model of concept learning,\nfrom which he concludes that concepts are unlearned. He offers various\nformulations and refinements of the argument over his career. Here is\na relatively recent rendition (2008: 139):\n\n\nNow, according to HF, the process by which one learns C must\ninclude the inductive evaluation of some such hypothesis as \u201cThe\nC things are the ones that are green or triangular\u201d. But\nthe inductive evaluation of that hypothesis itself requires (inter\nalia) bringing the property green or triangular before\nthe mind as such\u2026 Quite generally, you can\u2019t represent\nanything as such and such unless you already have the concept\nsuch and such. All that being so, it follows, on pain of\ncircularity, that \u201cconcept learning\u201d as HF understands it\ncan\u2019t be a way of acquiring concept C\u2026\nConclusion: If concept learning is as HF understands it, there can\nbe no such thing. This conclusion is entirely general; it\ndoesn\u2019t matter whether the target concept is primitive (like\ngreen) or complex (like green\nor triangular).\n\n\nFodor\u2019s argument does not presuppose RTT, COMP, or CTM. To the\nextent that the argument works, it applies to any view on which people\nhave concepts.\n\nIf concepts are not learned, then how are they acquired? Fodor offers\nsome preliminary remarks (2008: 144\u2013168), but by his own\nadmission the remarks are sketchy and leave numerous questions\nunanswered (2008: 144\u2013145). Prinz (2011) critiques Fodor\u2019s\npositive treatment of concept acquisition.\n\nThe most common rejoinder to Fodor\u2019s innateness argument is to\ndeny that HF is the only viable model of concept learning. The\nrejoinder acknowledges that concepts are not learned through\nhypothesis testing but insists they are learned through other\nmeans. Three examples:\n\n Margolis (1998) proposes an acquisition model that differs from\nHF but that allegedly yields concept learning. Fodor (2008:\n140\u2013144) retorts that Margolis\u2019s model does not yield\ngenuine concept learning. Margolis and Laurence (2011) insist that it\ndoes.\n Carey (2009) maintains that children can \u201cbootstrap\u201d\ntheir way to new concepts using induction, analogical reasoning, and\nother techniques. She develops her view in great detail, supporting it\npartly through her groundbreaking experimental work with young\nchildren. Fodor (2010) and Rey (2014) object that Carey\u2019s\nbootstrapping theory is circular: it surreptitiously presupposes that\nchildren already possess the very concepts whose acquisition it\npurports to explain. Beck (2017) and Carey (2014) respond to the\ncircularity objection.\n Shea (2016) argues that connectionist modeling can explain\nconcept acquisition in non-HF terms and that the resulting models\ninstantiate genuine learning.\n\n\nA lot depends here upon what counts as \u201clearning\u201d and what\ndoes not, a question that seems difficult to adjudicate. A closely\nconnected question is whether concept acquisition is a\nrational process or a mere causal process. To the\nextent that acquiring some concept is a rational achievement, we will\nwant to say that one learned the concept. To the extent that acquiring\nthe concept is a mere causal process (more like catching a cold than\nconfirming a hypothesis), we will feel less inclined to say that\ngenuine learning took place (Fodor 1981: 275).\n\nThese issues lie at the frontier of psychological and philosophical\nresearch. The key point for present purposes is that there are two\noptions for halting the regress of language learning: we can say that\nthinkers acquire concepts but do not learn them; or we can say that\nthinkers learn concepts through some means other than hypothesis\ntesting. Of course, it is not enough just to note that the two options\nexist. Ultimately, one must develop one\u2019s favored option into a\ncompelling theory. But there is no reason to think that doing so would\nreinitiate the regress. In any event, explaining concept acquisition\nis an important task facing any theorist who accepts that we have\nconcepts, whether or not the theorist accepts LOTH. Thus, the learning\nregress objection is best regarded not as posing a challenge specific\nto LOTH but rather as highlighting a more widely shared theoretical\nobligation: the obligation to explain how we acquire concepts.\n\nFor further discussion, see the entry on innateness.
