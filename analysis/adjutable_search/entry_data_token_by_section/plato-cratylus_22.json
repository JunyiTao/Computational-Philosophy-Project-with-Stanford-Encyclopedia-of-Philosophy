    "main_text": "Criticizing Naturalism (427d\u2013435d) || Socrates\u2019 Conclusion\n8.3 Socrates\u2019 Conclusion\n\nHaving established\n (CONV),\n Socrates makes a more general claim that is apparently supposed to\nwrap up his whole investigation (435b):\n\n(CONV*)\nConvention contributes to the correctness of names.\n\n\nTo lend further support to this conclusion, Socrates argues that there\nwould be a problem if one did not assume that convention has\n\u201csome authority concerning the correctness\u201d of the names\nfor the natural numbers (435b/c). But as he does not elaborate on the\nnature of this problem, the precise purport of his argument is\ncontested (see, e.g., Sedley 2003: 142 and Robinson 1956: 117). He\ngoes on, in any case, to state that while \u201che likes the idea\nthat names are, as far as possible, similar to the objects\u201d\n(435c), he sees no alternative to accepting\n (CONV*).\n\n(CONV*)\n is Socrates\u2019 last word on the correctness of names\u2014and a\ndisappointingly vague claim. How can one make sense of Socrates\u2019\nconcluding remarks despite their vagueness? One option, favoured by\nchampions of\n Reading A,\n is to argue that Socrates understates the true result of his\ninvestigation when he formulates (CONV*). What he could conclude after\npresenting the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument, and what\nPlato\u2019s readers are supposed to work out for themselves, is that\nthe correctness of all names is completely conventional. For while the\nskl\u00earot\u00eas argument and its conclusion (CONV)\nconcern only one name, it seems obvious that this argument could be\ngeneralized and would then vindicate a thoroughly conventionalist\nview. (To see why this may seem obvious, take another look at the\npremises of the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument.\n (P1)\n is about all correct names, and\n (P2)\n does not seem to concern the name skl\u00earon in\nparticular. But even when it comes to\n (P3),\n which is specifically about skl\u00earon as a name that\ndoes not successfully imitate hardness, a generalization seems to be\nwarranted. For even if it is granted that a given name succeeds at\nimitating hardness or any other way of being, it will still not seem\nto be this imitative success which guarantees that a hearer\nunderstands what a speaker is thinking of when using the name. As only\na shared convention would seem to ensure such understanding, (P3)\nappears to convey an insight that applies to all correct names. And if\none combines this insight with (P1) and a generalized version of (P2),\none will arrive at the conclusion that the correctness of all names is\ncompletely conventional.)\n\nBut of course, one could also take Socrates\u2019 endorsement of the\nvague\n (CONV*)\n to indicate that he is not convinced that the correctness of all\nnames is completely conventional and wants to stick to a suitably\nmodified version of\n (NAT**).\n This alternative assessment of Socrates\u2019 concluding remarks,\nwhich is favoured by champions of\n Reading B,\n can be elaborated in different ways. It has been argued, for\ninstance, that the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument concerns\nonly those names which\u2014like the name\nskl\u00earon\u2014contain letters that resemble a certain\nway of being and an equal number of letters that resemble the opposite\nway of being. While Socrates does indeed acknowledge that convention\nis crucial for the correctness of those names, he believes\nthat the correctness of all other names is completely dependent on\ntheir mimetic qualities or their etymological meaning (Sedley 2003:\n144f.). But the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument has also been\ntaken to show only that names fulfil some sort of minimal condition\nfor correctness in virtue of a convention, and thus to be compatible\nwith the idea that the degree of a name\u2019s correctness is a\nfunction of its mimetic qualities or its etymological meaning (Barney\n2001: 134\u2013142). There may be yet other elaborations of the idea\nthat Socrates\u2019 concluding remarks do not amount to a total\nrepudiation of\n (NAT**).\n They must all agree, however, in characterizing the import of the\nskl\u00earot\u00eas argument as more limited than it might\nappear to be.\n\nIs it also possible to maintain that Socrates rejects\n (NAT**)\n at 435b\u2013d, but not the more general claim that there is a\nnatural correctness of names? This is obviously how champions of\n Reading C\n would have to read Socrates\u2019 concluding remarks. Unfortunately,\nthere is no in-depth discussion of these remarks by any proponent of\nthis reading (see, however, Kretzmann 1971: 138, for some reflections\non the issue). Two conjectures about the shape that the suggested\ninterpretation would have to take seem reasonable, however:\n\nProponents of\n Reading C\n would have to read Socrates\u2019 official conclusion\n (CONV*)\n as the claim that while there is a natural correctness of names, the\nways in which correct names are composed of letters and syllables is\nconventional (see\n section 4.3).\nTo defend such an assessment of (CONV*), it would be necessary to\nexplain how the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument can justify a\nwholesale rejection of\n (NAT**)\n and yet fail to show that the correctness of all names is completely\nconventional.\n\n\nChoosing between these exegetical options is exceedingly difficult.\nThe fact that Socrates avowedly \u201clikes the idea that names are,\nas far as possible, similar to the objects\u201d might be thought to\nprove that he does not completely reject\n (NAT**).\n But a different reading is available: Socrates could be expressing\nthe conviction that most (etymologically simple) names are indeed\nsimilar to their referents while steering clear of the claim that this\nsimilarity constitutes their correctness (Ademollo 2011: 415). It is\ntrue, however, that it is not easy to make sense of 435b\u2013d, and\nespecially of the vague\n (CONV*),\n if one takes Socrates to believe that the correctness of all names is\ncompletely conventional. But on the other hand, it is harder to do\njustice to the skl\u00earot\u00eas argument if one does not\nascribe this belief to Socrates. Given the mixed signals Socrates\nsends, the debate about his conclusion is not likely to end anytime\nsoon.\n",
