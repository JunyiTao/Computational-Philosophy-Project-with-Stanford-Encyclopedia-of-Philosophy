One of the oldest such attempts is\ndue to John Stuart Mill (1996 [1843]), who presented a systematic\naccount of causal inference that consisted of five different so-called\n\u201cmethods\u201d: The Method of Agreement, the Method of\nDifference, the Joint Method of Agreement and of Difference, the\nMethod of Residues, and the Method Concomitant Variation. While some\nof these \u201cmethods\u201d pertain more to observation, the Method\nof Difference in particular is widely seen as encapsulating an\nimportant principle of scientific reasoning based on experiment. Mill\nhimself characterized it thus: \u201cIf an instance in which the\nphenomenon under investigation occurs, and an instance in which it\ndoes not occur, have every circumstance in common save one, that one\noccurring only in the former; the circumstance in which alone the two\ninstances differ, is the effect, or the cause, or an indispensable\npart of the cause, of the phenomenon\u201d (Mill 1996 [1843], Ch. 8,\n\u00a72). Thus, Mill\u2019s method of difference asks us to look at two\nsituations: one in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs,\nand one in which it does not occur. If a factor can be identified that\nis the only other difference between the two situations, then this\nfactor must be causally relevant.\n\nAs Mill noted, the method of difference is particularly germane to\nexperimental inquiry because such a difference as is required by this\nmethod can often be produced by an experimental intervention. Indeed,\naccording to a position known as interventionism about causality there\nis a tight connection between the concept of cause and experimental\ninterventions (Woodward 2003).\n\nMill\u2019s method of difference captures an important kind of reasoning\nthat is used frequently in biological experiments. Let\u2019s suppose we\nwant to find out if a newly discovered compound is an antibiotic,\ni.e., inhibits the growth of certain bacteria. We start by dividing a\nbacterial cell culture into several aliquots (samples of same size\nderived from a homogeneous solution). Then, we add to one group of\naliquots the suspected antibiotic that is dissolved in phosphate\nbuffer (\u201ctreatment\u201d). To the other group, we add only the\nphosphate buffer (\u201ccontrol\u201d). Then we record bacterial\ngrowth in all the samples (e.g., by measuring the increase in optical\ndensity as the culture medium clouds up due to the bacteria). This\nexperimental setup makes sure that the treatment and control samples\ndiffer only in the presence or absence of the antibiotic, thus ruling\nout that any observed difference in growth between the treatment and\ncontrol aliquots is caused not by the suspected antibiotic but by the\nbuffer solution. Let us denote the antibiotic as \u201cA\u201d and\nthe growth inhibition as \u201cW\u201d. Biologists would thus infer\nfrom this experiment that A is an antibiotic if W is observed in the\nsamples containing A but not in the samples not containing A.\n\nMill construed this \u201cmethod\u201d in terms of a principle of\ninductive inference that can be justified pragmatically.\nHowever, it is interesting to note that the principle can also be\nviewed as instantiating a form of deductive inference.\n\nTo this end, of course, the Method of Difference must be strengthened\nwith additional premises. Here is one way how this can be done\n(adapted from Hofmann and Baumgartner 2011):\n\nS1 and S2 are two homogeneous test\nsituations (assumption)\nTwo factors A and W both occur in S1 both not in\nS2 (exp. result)\nW is an effect in a deterministic causal structure\n(assumption)\nIn S1 there exists a cause of the occurrence of W (from\n2, 3)\nIn S2 there exists no cause of the occurrence of W\n(from 2,3)\nS2 contains no confounder of W (from 5)\nS1 contains no confounder of W (from 1,6)\nThe cause of W belongs to the set {A, W} (from 4, 7)\nW does not cause itself (assumption)\nA is the cause or a part of the cause existing in\nS1\n\n\nSome of the terms used in this deduction require explication. Two test\nsituations are homogeneous on the condition that, if a factor\nis causally relevant and is present in test situation S1,\nthen it is also present in test situation S2, and vice\nversa. A confounder would be a causally relevant factor that\ndoes not belong to the set {A, W}. The presence of such a confounder\nis excluded by the assumption of causal homogeneity (1). In practical\nsituations, a confounder might be an unknown or uncontrolled (i.e.,\nnot measurable or not measured) factor that is present in only one of\nthe test situations. In our antibiotics example, this could be some\nchemical that was put into just one aliquot inadvertently or without\nknowledge of the experimenter. In fact, the risk of a confounder is\nprecisely why our biological experimenter will divide up the mother\nculture into aliquots just before putting in the substance to be\ntested. This makes it unlikely that one aliquot contains an\nuncontrolled chemical that the other does not contain. Furthermore, a\nskilled experimenter will make sure that the cultures are well\nstirred, thus preventing a physical-chemical inhomogeneity of the\nculture (e.g., some chemical or temperature gradient). Thus, there are\ntypical laboratory manipulations and procedures that reduce the risk\nof confounders.\n\nIn spite of these control procedures, it is clear that the derivation\nof a causal factor from a Millean difference test presupposes strong\nassumptions. In particular, it must be assumed that we are dealing\nwith a deterministic causal structure (3) and that nothing happens\nuncaused (4). In our simple example, this amounts to assuming that the\nbacteria don\u2019t exhibit any kind of spontaneity, in other words, their\ngrowth behavior is assumed to be determined by their genetic\nconstitution and their environment (although most biologists are\nconvinced that their experimental organisms have good and bad days\njust like themselves!).\n\nIf we thus construe Millean causal reasoning as deductive reasoning,\nall the inferential risks are shifted from the induction rules into\nthe premises such as causal homogeneity, determinism and the principle\nof universal causality. It is a characteristic feature of inductive\ninference that this is always possible (Norton 2003). A justification\nof these premises, of course, does not exist. They may be viewed as\nbeing part and parcel of a certain kind of experimental practice that\nis vindicated as a whole by its fruitfulness for research (see\n Section 5).\n",
