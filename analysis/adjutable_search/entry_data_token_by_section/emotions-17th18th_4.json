    "main_text": "The Context of Early Modern Theories of the Passions || Philosophical Issues in Theories of the Emotions\n2.3 Philosophical Issues in Theories of the Emotions\n\nFew areas of early modern philosophy remained untouched by at least\nsome theory of the emotions. What follows is simply a cursory overview\nof some issues of general interest. But since early modern\nunderstandings of the emotions often made unexpected connections\nbetween diverse areas of philosophy, we may find that investigation\nreshapes our map of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century philosophy.\nCertainly, the understanding of the emotions produced in one area of\nphilosophy was not isolated from their treatment in other areas.\n\nThat is true of how the emotions figured in much of\nseventeenth-century metaphysics. Locating the emotions within their\ndistinctive ontologies was an important, but sometimes challenging\ntask for philosophers such as Descartes, Malebranche, and Spinoza. In\ndoing so, they often tapped a broad metaphysical distinction between\nthe active and the passive, which sometimes supported, and sometimes\nundermined those ontologies (see James 1997). The emotions also inform\nvarious approaches to the relation between mind and body, whether\nDescartes\u2019s dualism, Hobbes\u2019s materialism, Spinoza\u2019s parallelism, or\nthose of philosophers who refused to take a stand on the issue.\nIndeed, attempts to accommodate the emotions sometimes led to novel\nand intricate pictures of the relations between soul and body: Walter\nCharleton\u2019s Natural History of the Passions (1674,\n2nd ed., 1701), for instance, posits two souls, one that is\nrational and immaterial and one that is sensitive and extended,\nmediating between the rational soul and the body. The emotions were\nalso important in accounts of personal identity, whether that is\nunderstood ontologically in the cases of Descartes and Spinoza, or\npsychologically in the case of Hume.\n\nTheories of the emotions played a role \u2013 often a pivotal one\n\u2013 in the important early modern debates about causation and the\nproper forms of explanation. As part of their embrace of the new\nscience, many seventeenth century philosophers considered the emotions\nto be susceptible, at least in part, to mechanical explanation.\nAlthough Descartes offered a teleological defense of our propensities\nto experience emotions, his account of their physiological\nunderpinnings is mechanistic. Malebranche too considered the functions\nof the emotions and the way in which that functioning has been\ncorrupted, but emphasized that the emotions are communicated through\nstrictly mechanical operations. Hobbes and Spinoza went yet further,\nrejecting any talk of final causation in order to treat the behavior\nof the emotions as completely continuous with bodily movements, and\nindeed reducing the appearance of goal-driven behavior to the motions\nof the passions. In contrast, Shaftesbury criticized Locke and\nDescartes for failing to appreciate the natural teleology of our\nemotional constitution, and dismissed all physiological accounts as\nbeside the point. Many other British philosophers showed less interest\nin the metaphysics of explanation and more in defending an empiricist\naccount of the origins of our ideas. But the rejection of innate ideas\noften drove them to focus explanations of the emotions on the\nhydraulics by which pains and pleasures push our ideas. This\nnaturalistic approach was particularly marked in eighteenth-century\nassociationist psychology, often hand in hand with\n\u2018Newtonian\u2019 ambitions to produce a \u201cscience of\nman:\u201d examples include Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature\n(1739\u201340), and such lesser-known works as David Hartley\u2019s\nObservations on Man, his Frame, his Duty, and his\nExpectations (1749) and an anonymous tract of 1741, An\nEnquiry into the Origin of Human Appetites and Affections, Showing How\nEach Arises from Association: for the use of young gentlemen at the\nuniversities (cited in Gardiner 1970, 221), as well as in the\nworks of Condillac.\n\nAs we might expect, emotions loomed large in the philosophical\npsychology of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. One question\naddressed by almost every philosopher was where to locate the emotions\nin our psychological equipment. Following Descartes, seventeenth\ncentury philosophers tended to subsume the emotions under perception,\nalthough Hobbes was a bit of an exception, identifying passions with\nthe \u201csmall beginnings\u201d (motives) of voluntary,\n\u201canimal\u201d actions, while finding their origins in sense and\nimagination. \u2018Perception\u2019 must be broadly understood,\nhowever; what is crucial is that the emotions involve the exercise of\na receptive faculty, especially insofar as their causes lie in the\nbody, or more generally, outside of the receptive animal. Spinoza,\nadmittedly, allowed that we may be adequate causes of some of our\naffects, and took all our emotions to involve judgments. But on his\nview, judgments are not different in kind from perceptions, although\ntheir epistemic status depends on whether we are active and adequate,\nor merely passive, inadequate causes of our perceptions. Descartes,\ntoo, attributed a representative structure to emotions that could look\nproto-propositional. This structure, however, is independent of and\nprior to the volitions of assent or denial that generate real\njudgment. The emotions thus remain among the perceptions belonging to\nthe intellect, although they provide material for judgment.\nNonetheless, since perceptions were typically granted a complex\nrepresentational and intentional structure, most seventeenth century\nauthors could draw close connections between emotions and\njudgments.\n\nEighteenth century theorists, on the other hand, often identified\nemotions specifically with sense-perceptions. Indeed, Hutcheson\nmultiplied the number of our sense-faculties to accommodate the wide\nvariety of affects he recognizes, while DuBos spoke of the\n\u201csixth sense\u201d by which we evaluate poetry and painting.\nMany philosophers also supposed a haptic aspect to emotions,\napproaching them as a variety of feeling. Most notably, Hume\nmaintained that a distinctive feature of the passions and sentiments\nis that they touch, or strike upon the mind more forcibly than other\nperceptions.\n\nMore generally, eighteenth-century theories shift gradually from\ncharacterizing emotions primarily by how they represent their\nintentional contents to considering their qualitative phenomenology,\nthe special \u2018feel\u2019 of the emotions. Hume, for one,\nstressed that our passions are \u201csimple and uniform\nimpressions\u201d with characteristic affective qualities Still, this\nis at most a change in emphasis, since many did allow that emotions\ntypically have some kind of object. Hume, in particular, attributed a\nrather complicated structure to the indirect passions that show a\n\u201cdouble relation of impressions and ideas.\u201d But the\natomistic tendencies of British psychology following Locke spelled\ndifficulty for accounts of intentional content, and many philosophers\nemphasized features of our emotions that are non-intentional. Emotions\nstill retained important connections to judgment, however, since\njudgments themselves, especially moral, aesthetic and other\nevaluations, were often considered expressions of sentiment.\n\nFor all their disagreements about the nature of judgment, early modern\nphilosophers reached near-consensus in taking emotion to motivate our\npractical and theoretical endeavors either directly or indirectly.\nBecause they provide, or at least shape, motives for action, the\nemotions were central to investigations of our practical reasoning and\nto moral philosophy. In particular, eighteenth-century spectator- and\njudgment-centered moral theories gave the emotions a double role for\nour moral judgments: insofar as they represent the enduring\ndispositions of character expressed in actions, they are the objects\nof moral evaluations; but they also generate the judgments themselves.\nIn a somewhat different vein, many philosophers took our emotions to\nbe the engine driving our theoretical reasoning: both wonder (for\nDescartes) and curiosity (for Hume) perform this function. Indeed,\nalmost any philosopher investigating efficient causation in our\npsychology found an important place for our emotions, whether Hobbes\nconsidering our internal motions, or the associationist psychologists\nof the eighteenth century.\n\nAs crucial bits of our psychology, the emotions are also important to\nepistemology. Here, though, the position of many early modern\nphilosophers has often been misunderstood, especially when it is\nassumed that they oppose reason to the emotions, to the detriment of\nthe latter. (We might call this the \u2018Mr. Spock\u2019 gloss on\nearly modern philosophy.) It is true that many philosophers held that\nthe emotions can sometimes lead our reasoning astray, and they offer\nvarious epistemic techniques to minimize this cognitive interference.\nMalebranche, for instance, imbedded his account of the passions in the\nreforming project of The Search After Truth (1674\u20135), and\nmany accounts of method, e.g., Arnauld\u2019s and Nicole\u2019s Logic, or\nthe Art of Thinking (1662), or Part II of Mary Astell\u2019s\nSerious Proposal to the Ladies (1697), included an account of\nthe emotions as an indispensable part of their epistemic techniques.\nBut none of these accounts assumed that the emotions are inevitably\ndisruptive to our reason, however important it may be to temper them.\nDescartes particularly emphasized the functionality of our passions,\nfirst for practical, but also for theoretical reasoning, and suggested\nthat proper discipline should allow us to maximize the epistemic value\nof the emotions. Malebranche and Spinoza were less sanguine about our\nchances of doing so, but even Malebranche maintained that the passions\nare functional in several respects. Hobbes, on the other hand, mounted\na number of contrasts between passions and the \u201ccommon\nmeasure\u201d of reason. But these seem somewhat at odds with his\nclaims about the operation of the passions in driving mental activity.\nHere it is worth considering Spinoza\u2019s account of the relation between\nreason and the affects, for it offers a kind of gloss on Hobbes. It\nis, Spinoza maintained, only our passive emotions that can produce\nconflict with the dictates of our reason; our active affects accord\nwell with reason. Hume, of course, denied that it makes any sense to\nspeak of a conflict between reason and passion, when he declared that\nreason not only is, \u201cbut ought only to be\u201d the slave to\nthe passions \u2013 a dictum that seems to apply to theoretical as\nwell as practical reason. Later eighteenth-century philosophers\ndeveloped the view that our reasoning faculties, and particularly our\nlanguage, are a historical development from our emotions; this seems\nto have been the view of Condillac and Rousseau.\n\nOne of the most important contexts for understanding the epistemic\nstrengths and weaknesses attributed to the emotions lies in their\nrelation to the imagination. Accounts of what exactly this faculty is\nchanged dramatically from the seventeenth to the eighteenth centuries,\nbut in one way or another, the emotions were commonly understood to\ninteract closely with the imagination. On some views, the imagination\nprovides a conduit between the emotions and the body. Both pre-modern\nand modern folk medicine held that experiencing strong emotions could\naffect the imagination of a pregnant woman in such a way as to leave\nmarks on her fetus. Indeed, so close was the connection supposed to be\nthat simply imagining emotionally-fraught situations could mark the\ndevelopment of the fetus, and there was a substantial literature of\neighteenth-century manuals instructing mothers-to-be on the proper\ncontrol of their affective states. (See Smith 2006 and Kukla 2005.)\nDescartes made mention of such views, and more generally saw the\nimagination as an important tool for managing the emotions: picturing\nthings in the imagination could have affective results, so\nmanipulating the imagination is an effective way of controlling our\nemotions and their effects. The view taken of the interaction between\nemotions and imagination changed with shifts in how the faculty of the\nimagination \u2013 and the relation between mind and body in general\n\u2013 were understood. Hume, for instance, considered the\nimagination to be the faculty of composing, decomposing, and\nassociating ideas, in contrast to the impressions among which passions\nwere numbered. Nonetheless, there is still some role for the\nimagination in producing and manipulating affects, and vice-versa. The\nimagination is also a crucial mechanism in the social communication of\nthe passions, a topic considered by both Malebranche and Hume.\n\nThe physiology of the emotions and their implications for medicine was\nanother important theme in early modern philosophy. (Here too the\nimagination has a role to play.) Descartes considered the emotions\ncentral to the treatment of both mental and bodily illness. In doing\nso, he joined a long and popular medical tradition treating the\nemotions, including Robert Burton\u2019s Anatomy of Melancholy\n(1621) and William Falconer\u2019s A Dissertation on the Influence of\nthe Passions upon the Disorders of the Body (1788). Burton\u2019s work\nwas conservative, if eclectic, in its approach to understanding the\nsoul and using the machinery of humours and spirits to explain emotion\nand temperament. But many other writers borrowed piecemeal from the\nlanguage of humours and spirits, sometimes embedding it in new\nphysiological accounts, sometimes simply using it to describe various\naffects. Descartes and Malebranche, for instance, spoke of the animal\nspirits, but also used such new tools as Harvey\u2019s discovery of the\ncirculation of the blood to explain the bodily effects of\nemotions.\n\nThe affective aspects of mental disorders are matters of particular\ninterest. Some of that interest may have been personal, since\n\u2018melancholy\u2019 was widely taken to be a special affliction\nof the learned, a point that puts some of Hume\u2019s discussion of the\nemotional effects of skepticism in context. \u2018Enthusiasm,\u2019\nparticularly religious enthusiasm, also garnered a great deal of\nattention, considered as a matter of excessive and contagious emotion\nthat could be based in bodily disorders. But since many philosophers\nof the eighteenth century followed Shaftesbury in refusing to consider\nthe physiology of the emotions, they relegated the bodily causes,\ncomponents and effects to the attention of \u2018anatomists,\u2019\nrather than of philosophers. More generally, the sort of humour-driven\napproach to medicine and pathology that informed many\nseventeenth-century accounts of the emotions declined among eighteenth\ncentury philosophers.\n\nSome of the most important issues raised by the emotions in early\nmodern philosophy are practical, especially those concerning practical\nreason, the pursuit of happiness and moral philosophy. As we have\nseen, the emotions were generally tied closely to motivations for\naction. They are not necessarily the only, or the immediate sources of\nmotivation: Descartes and Malebranche considered reason to offer\nmotivations of its own, as did Pascal, who also admitted yet other\nsources of motivation. But many other philosophers, such as Hobbes,\nHutcheson and Hume took the emotions to be the driving source of our\npractical reason. None of them, however, maintained that the emotions\nwere immune to training and refinement, and indeed all early modern\nphilosophers took it as important for both morality and happiness that\nwe do train our emotions. The practical philosophies offered by\nDescartes, Malebranche and Spinoza are particularly concerned with the\npursuit of happiness, which they assume involves both managing and\ncultivating the emotions. Both Descartes and Spinoza sought\n\u201cremedies\u201d for the passions, which they take to be central\nto what Descartes called \u201cpursuing virtue\u201d and Spinoza\n\u201cfreedom from bondage.\u201d Spinoza criticized Descartes for\nthinking that such remedy could provide complete control, but they\nshared the view that remediated emotions are crucial to the good life,\nconceived both eudaimonistically and morally. Malebranche considered\ncorrupted passions to be \u201cinordinate\u201d and in need of\nregulation, a bit of language that Norris and Astell later picked up,\nalthough with less emphasis on the perversion of order through\nsin.\n\nThe pursuit of happiness was also an issue for British philosophers\nsuch as Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, although it sometimes paled next to\ntheir interests in moral evaluation. Shaftesbury argued vehemently\nthat \u201cvirtue and interest coincide,\u201d because he maintained\nthat happiness depends on a preponderance of pleasant affects, and the\nemotions carrying moral worth are themselves pleasant. To this end, he\nintroduced a notion of the \u201ceconomy\u201d of the passions\n(Inquiry 198). Yet he had to argue the point, since he did\nnot understand virtue primarily in terms of individual flourishing,\nbut within an overall economy and balance of nature. Hutcheson also\nconsidered how the passions contribute or detract from our happiness.\nAnd like Shaftesbury, he speaks of our search for a \u201cjust\nBallance and Oeconomy\u201d (Essay 47), in which our\npassions and affections are properly governed, although he takes\nachieving such economy to be difficult. Hutcheson\u2019s talk of\n\u201cthe government of the passions\u201d (see Essay 66)\nthus looks a bit different from the command that the passions in\ngeneral should be governed, a theme found in a number of sermons (see,\ne.g., Ayloffe, Clarke). Instead, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson and Hume\nincorporated the emotions into their efforts to explain how we make\njudgments of moral worth on the basis of our moral senses. It is our\nemotions that allow us to be responsive to the moral qualities we\nevaluate. For this reason, they may all seem committed to a\n\u2018sentimentalist\u2019 moral philosophy. Hutcheson and Hume did\nindeed oppose the moral \u2018rationalists,\u2019 arguing that there\nis no independent quality in actions or persons to which emotions are\nsensitive. But their position presupposes a very particular\nunderstanding of the nature of our senses and of the ontological\nstatus of the secondary qualities to which they are receptive. In\ncontrast, Shaftesbury often suggests both that there are moral and\naesthetic qualities intrinsic to the external world, and that we\naccess those qualities through our emotions. On this view, our\nemotions, at least when functioning as they should, are simply our\nnatural equipment for picking up salient features of the world.\n\nEarly modern philosophy held a special place for the emotions in its\npolitical and social theory (see Kahn, Saccamano & Coli, 2006).\nIndeed, there was a popular early modern genre of \u2018how-to\u2019\nbooks about techniques for governing others by managing their\nemotions. Likewise, a great deal of political philosophy concerned the\nmanagement of the emotions by social institutions and authorities,\nwith Hobbes and Mandeville being just two of the most obvious\nexamples. Hume picks up on the language of remedying our emotions to\ndiscuss how practices of justice and institutions of magistracy\nremediate our partial affections (see T 489). But there are also\ndeeper issues about what role the emotions might play in making social\norder possible. Many philosophers held that the emotions facilitated\nsocial interaction: Descartes suggested something of the sort in his\nanalyses of such passions as love and generosity. Malebranche was even\nmore clearly committed to the view, holding that the communication of\nthe emotions is crucial to social organization, ranking and cohesion.\nHobbes and Spinoza, in contrast, found the grounds of much\ninterpersonal conflict in the emotions, and even diagnosed specific\nemotions as inherently disruptive to social order, e.g., glory for\nHobbes. But by the same token, there are many passions that Hobbes\nstated \u201cincline us to peace,\u201d and Spinoza allowed that\ninsofar as people agree in affects, they agree in nature.\nEighteenth-century philosophers tended to evaluate the social effects\nof the emotions in terms of whether they were self- or other-directed,\nwith Shaftesbury and Hutcheson arguing against Mandeville that our\nmost natural emotions were other-directed. In his Philosophical\nEnquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful\n(1759), Edmund Burke distinguished between the passions directed at\nself-preservation and those belonging to society, but spends the\nlion\u2019s share of his time on the latter. The issue is somewhat more\ncomplicated in Hume, but he does seem to take the development of our\nemotions and their susceptibility to a standard of appropriateness to\nbe indispensable to many of the \u201cartifices\u201d that make\nsocial life possible. A different twist is provided by Rousseau\u2019s\ncontrast between two kinds of self-directed affection, amour de\nsoi and amour propre, of which the former, but not the\nlatter seems consistent with compassion for others.\n\nThe place of the emotions in early modern aesthetic theories deserves\na separate treatment. The representation of the emotions was\nconsidered a proper object, sometimes the object, of\naesthetic criticism. It was also the subject of many practical manuals\nin the arts; there is, for instance, an extensive seventeenth-century\nliterature stemming from discussions in the French Royal Academy of\nPainting and Sculpture about how to depict facial expressions and\nbodily gestures in ways that would allow the deciphering of emotional\nstates. Here the representation of the emotions serves both narrative\nand didactic purposes.\n\nAnother commonplace of early modern aesthetics was the importance of\nexciting emotions in the audience for a work of art. This is a common\ntheme in musical aesthetics, which borrowed heavily from rhetorical\ntreatises. Baroque composers developed an entire theory of affects,\nand of musical figures to express those affects, for just this end.\n(See the Grove Dictionary of Music.) Another version of this\ntheme appears in philosophical discussions of tragedy; since it is\nassumed that the dramatic depiction of emotions excites the same\nemotions in the audience, tragic drama presents a bit of a puzzle. It\nseems odd that we should enjoy the experience, and even enjoy it in\nproportion to the distress it invokes. Malebranche, Hutcheson and Hume\nare just a few to address this puzzle by developing accounts of the\nmeta-pleasures afforded to us by the exercise of our emotions.\n\nEighteenth-century aesthetics moved away somewhat from the view that\nthe arts should carefully control our emotions, although the notion\nthat artworks both express and excite emotions remained. Particularly\ninteresting in this regard is the development of the concept of the\nsublime. As Burke explains it, the experience of the sublime\ntransgresses categories of pain and pleasure and explains much of our\nresponse to dramatic tragedy. Here it seems that aesthetic, and other\ndistinctive experiences can produce emotions that are sui\ngeneris, a view that gives aesthetics a particular importance for\nany understanding of the emotions.\n\nSeveral of the most important discussions of the emotions in the early\nmodern period involved women, who sometimes raised specific concerns\nrelevant to their status as women. That is the case with Princess\nElisabeth of Bohemia, whose correspondence pushed Descartes to write\non the passions, while pursuing a lengthy discussion of the impact of\nthe emotions on health and reasoning and our ability to control them.\nElisabeth also seems to have inspired other writers on the emotions,\nserving as the dedicatee for the Treatise of the Passions and\nFaculties of the Soul of Man (1640) of Edward Reynolds, the\nBishop of Norwich. Both Mary Astell in Letters Concerning the Love\nof God (1695) and Damaris Cudworth, Lady Masham, in Discourse\nConcerning the Love of God (1696) took issue with the\nMalebranchean account of love offered by John Norris, albeit to very\ndifferent degrees and from different approaches. Later in the\neighteenth century, Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s criticisms of Rousseau\nspecifically addressed some of his views about emotional development\nand the sexual division of labor in the sentimental education of\nchildren. However, since some recent commentators have turned to early\nmodern discussions to understand how the emotions can be conceptually\ngendered, we should note that many women philosophers of this period\nshowed no unusual interest in the emotions. It does not seem to have\nbeen considered a special area of expertise for women.\n\nAlthough early modern philosophy did not seem to associate concepts of\nthe emotions as such with gender, there is still a great deal of\ngender-baggage to investigate. Many authors took the position that\nthere were important sexual differences in the disposition to feel\nspecific emotions. Malebranche allowed that there are many such\ndifferences, not just between the sexes, but for different ages,\nfortunes and stations in life; indeed, it is differences between\nindividuals\u2019 \u201cstations in life\u201d that do the most work for\nhim in explaining variations in affective susceptibilities. Other\nauthors laid such variations at the doorstep of bodily composition,\nespecially the constitution of the brain, and took the relevant\ndifferences to be especially and intrinsically marked between the\nsexes (although they could also typify class and rank). In Les\nCharacteres des Passions (1648\u201362), Marin Cureau de la Chambre\ndiscussed the effects that the liquid humours in the brain could have\non emotional temperament, taking it as an explanation of why some\npeople (women, as well as children and drunkards) cry more readily\nthan others.\n\nSome more distinctively gendered and more evaluatively loaded claims\nabout the emotions appeared in the eighteenth century, particularly in\naesthetic theory. Shaftesbury is a bit of a villain here, contrasting\ntrue taste with the trivial sentiments of merely feminine taste. Some\nauthors even distinguished aesthetic qualities and emotions through\ngendered contrasts, as when feminine beauty is opposed to the\nmasculine sublime (with, of course, the preference going to the\nsublime). By the end of the eighteenth century, Wollstonecraft\nbemoaned that women socialized to be ladies fall \u201cmore under the\ninfluence of sentiments than passions,\u201d suggesting a gendered\ndivision between sentiment and passion echoed in several other\npassages in the work (1792, 49). But that is not a contrast found in\nmany earlier authors.\n\nThe emotions did, however, play a special role for some philosophers\nwho defended women\u2019s intellectual aptitude. Feminist philosophers such\nas Fran\u00e7ois Poulain de la Barre and Mary Astell appealed to the\nemotions both to explain sexist prejudice and to make their case for\nwomen\u2019s pursuit of philosophy. Poulain de la Barre traces misogynist\nridicule to surprise at the unfamiliar in his On the Equality of\nthe Two Sexes (1673), while his On the Education of Ladies\n(1674) illustrates how women can develop the assurance and\nself-trust needed for the intellectual life. Astell posits the\ncultivation of the intellect, along with the development of\n\u201cgenerosity\u201d and \u201cto be passionately in Love with Truth\u201d (2002, 165)\nas the most important means to regulate the passions. In contrast, she\noften pairs \u201cprejudices\u201d and \u201cirregular passions\u201d as the obstacles for\npersons generally and women in particular that her serious proposals\nseek to overcome.\n",
