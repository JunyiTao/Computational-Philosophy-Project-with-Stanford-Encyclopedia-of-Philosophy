    "main_text": "Fazang (643\u2013712)\n4. Fazang (643\u2013712)\n\nFazang is Zhiyan\u2019s most accomplished and influential student,\nand became the third patriarch of Huayan. He is responsible for\nsystematizing and extending Zhiyan\u2019s teaching, and for securing\nthe prominence of Huayan-style Buddhism at the imperial court. He is\nknown especially for his definitive commentaries on the Avatamsaka\nSutra and Awakening of Faith in Mahayana, and for making\nHuayan doctrines accessible to laity with familiar technologies such\nas mirror halls and wood-block printing. These contributions support\nthe traditional regard for Fazang as the third patriarch of the Huayan\nSchool.\n\nFazang\u2019s ancestors came from Sogdiana (a center for trade along\nthe Silk Road, located in what is now parts of Uzbekistan and\nTajikestan), but he was born in the Tang dynasty capital of\nChang\u2019an (now Xi\u2019an), where his family had become\nculturally Chinese. Fazang was a fervently religious adolescent.\nFollowing a then-popular custom that took self-immolation as a sign of\nreligious devotion, Fazang burned his fingers before a stupa at the\nage of 16. After becoming a monk, he assisted Xuanzang\u2014famous\nfor his pilgrimage to India\u2014in translating Buddhist works from\nSanskrit into Chinese. Fazang had doctrinal differences with Xuanzang,\nthough, so he later became a disciple of Zhiyan, probably around 663\nCE. \n\nZhiyan\u2019s access to the imperial court gave Fazang access to\nEmpress Wu, with whom he quickly gained favor. He undertook a variety\nof public services, such as performing rain-prayer rituals and\ncollaborating in various translation projects. He traveled throughout\nnorthern China, teaching the Avatamsaka Sutra and debating\nDaoists. He intervened in a 697 military confrontation with the\nKhitans, gaining further favor when Empress Wu ascribed to his ritual\nservices an instrumental role in suppressing the rebellion. In\naddition, Fazang provided information to undermine plots by some of\nthe empress\u2019 advisors to secure power after her death. This\nsecured Fazang\u2019s status\u2014and the prominence of Huayan\nteachings\u2014with subsequent rulers. \n",
