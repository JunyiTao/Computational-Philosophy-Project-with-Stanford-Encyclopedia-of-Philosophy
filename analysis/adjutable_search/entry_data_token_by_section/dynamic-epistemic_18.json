    "main_text": "Applications of Dynamic Epistemic Logic || Connections to mainstream Epistemology\n6.3 Connections to mainstream Epistemology\n\nA number of works utilize tools and techniques from Dynamic Epistemic\nLogic for formal reasoning on topics in mainstream Epistemology. \n\n Baltag and Smets (2008b) use plausibility models\n (Section 4.3)\n and The Logic of Doxastic Actions\n (Section 4.4)\n to capture a number of notions of knowledge, including Aumann\u2019s\npartition-based notion and Stalnaker\u2019s (2006) formalization of\nLehrer\u2019s (1990, 2000) defeasibility analysis of knowledge. \nBuilding on the work mentioned in the previous item, Baltag,\nRenne, and Smets (2014) show that a theory \\(\\JBG\\) of Justified\nBelief with \u201cGood\u201d Evidence can be used to reason about\ncertain examples from mainstream Epistemology. For example, Gettier\n(1963) constructs a famous counterexample to the claim that\n\u201cknowledge\u201d may be equated with \u201cjustified true\nbelief\u201d (i.e., justified correct belief). In this\nexample, an agent\u2014let us call her a\u2014has evidence\nfor a propositional letter f, concludes via logical deduction\nthat \\(b\\lor f\\), and therefore has evidence for this disjunction;\nhowever, unknown to the agent, f is false but b is true.\nShe therefore has justified true belief but not knowledge that \\(b\\lor\nf\\) is true (since her reason for believing this disjunction is based\non her belief in the wrong disjunct). This example is easily\nreconstructed in \\(\\JBG\\), providing one formal account of an agent\nwhose justified belief is correct and yet the agent does not have\nknowledge (even in a weakly defeasible sense). See\n Appendix K\n for additional details. \nBaltag, Renne, and Smets (2012) analyze a Gettier-like example due\nto Lehrer (1990, 2000) in a variant of \\(\\JBG\\) that includes dynamic\noperations for addition of evidence, stepwise logical reasoning,\nannouncement-like addition of evidence with world elimination, and\nevidence-based plausibility upgrades of worlds. \nFitch\u2019s paradox (Fitch 1963) concerns the seemingly strange\nresult that the existence of unknown truths implies not all truths are\nknowable. Following the suggestion of van Benthem (2004), Balbiani et\nal. (2008) equate \u201cknowability\u201d with \u201cbeing known\nafter some announcement\u201d and show using Arbitrary Public\nAnnouncement Logic (see\n Appendix E)\n that it is jointly inconsistent to assume that \u201cp is an\nunknown truth\u201d and that \u201call truths are knowable\u201d.\nWe refer the reader to the discussions in van Benthem (2004), Balbiani\net al. (2008), and Brogaard and Salerno (2012) for further details.\n\n\n",
