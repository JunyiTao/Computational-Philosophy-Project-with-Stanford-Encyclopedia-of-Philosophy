    "main_text": "Processes of Reconciliation || Apologies\n3.1 Apologies\n\nApologizing is perhaps the most explicit way in which wrongdoing can\nbe acknowledged. A well-formed apology requires at least\nacknowledgement of both the fact of wrongdoing and responsibility by\nthe wrongdoer, as well as an expression of regret or remorse (Tavuchis\n1991). Ideally, the wrongdoer directly addresses the victim. This is\nnot possible in all cases, of course, as when victims have passed\naway. However, apologies made to indirect victims, such as the\nfamilies of the deceased, as well as apologies performed before\nbroader, interested communities are well established in practice. In\nrecent decades, official apologies, delivered by state entities or\ncorporations, have become more common, raising questions about the\nvalidity and significance of apologetic statements made by\nrepresentatives on behalf of groups (Harvey 1995, Gibney et al 2008),\nespecially when the events in question lie in the distant past\n(Pettigrove 2003).\n\nApologies are frequently valued, not merely as acknowledgements of\npast wrongdoing and gestures of respect to victims, but also as\nproviding evidence of a positive change in the wrongdoer or in the\nwrongdoers\u2019 group. Parties who have come to take responsibility\nfor and repudiate past wrongful actions are better candidates for\nrenewed relationships of cooperation and trust (de Greiff 2008). This\npotential is undermined, however, where apologies are overly vague,\nincomplete, or appear insincere. One may reasonably question whether\nmere admissions that \u201cmistakes were made\u201d (which do not\nown up to responsibility or specify what the mistakes themselves were)\nor that the speaker \u201cregrets if anyone took offense\u201d\n(which leaves open the question of whether the action was really\nwrong) qualify as apologies at all (Smith 2008). The importance of\nbeing sensitive to the gendered aspects of apology has also been\nhighlighted (MacLachlan 2013).\n\nWhile apologies are considered by some to make a significant\ncontribution to reconciliation (Brooks 2004, M. Murphy 2011), others\nworry that, in political cases, apologies may be used as a substitute\nfor more substantive forms of redress (Corntassel and Holder 2008).\nOfficial state apologies for systematic or historic injustices often\nresult only after protracted and heated debate, leaving little\npolitical will to move on to other forms of redress that may be more\nsignificant to the victimized group. Such dynamics give credence to\nthe view that apology may amount to a \u201cpolitics of\ndistraction\u201d (Corntassel and Holder 2008).\n",
