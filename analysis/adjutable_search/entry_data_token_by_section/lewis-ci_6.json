    "main_text": "The Given\n7. Action, the Good, and the Right\n\nIn contrast with those logical positivists who thought that statements\nof value merely express attitudes, pro or con, to\nobjects, persons, or situations, but are neither true nor false, Lewis\n(1946, 396\u201398) thought that statements of value were as true or\nfalse as other empirical statements, and every bit as empirically\nverifiable or falsifiable, confirmable or disconfirmable. True, felt\nvalue qualia, felt goodness and badness, are given to us and\ndirectly apprehended in experience or stretches of experience, and\n\u201cexpressive\u201d statements must be used to indicate or convey\nthem. However, such statements, like Lewis\u2019 other\n\u201cexpressive\u201d statements, may be true or false (see\nprevious section), and simply convey the occurrence of given\nqualia in experience and no more, instead of indicating the\nexistence of objects, situations, or persons, and expressing our\nattitudes to them. Moreover, there are also for Lewis terminating\njudgments of value concerning what the felt value of some experiences\nindicates about the felt value of further experiences. Finally, there\nare \u201cobjective\u201d judgements of value: judgements\nattributing value to persons, objects, and objective situations, in so\nfar as they have the potential, depending on circumstances, to produce\nfelt goodness or badness in us or others. These are non-terminating\njudgements of value and are empirically confirmable or disconfirmable\nby induction just like any other objective empirical judgement. Lewis\nthus claims that his theory of value is thoroughly naturalistic and\nhumanistic, rather than transcendental, but still objectivist. \n\nThe felt goodness of experience is what is intrinsically good or\nvaluable for its own sake. It is only experience in so far as it has\nsuch value quality that is intrinsically good rather than merely\nextrinsically valuable for its contribution to something else that is\nintrinsically valuable. Value and disvalue are modes or aspects of\nexperience to which desire and aversion are \u201caddressed\u201d\n(Lewis 1946, 403). Lewis denies that \u201cpleasure\u201d is\nadequate to the wide variety of what is found directly good in\nexperience, and thus thinks it inadequate as a synonym for\n\u201cgood\u201d. However, as Frankena (1964) argues, for Lewis\ndirectly found goodness still seems to be as natural a quality or\nproperty of certain experiences as any other qualia directly\napprehended in experience. Nonetheless, the value of a stretch of\nexperience, indeed a whole life, isn\u2019t just the value (and\ndisvalue) of the parts, and in AKV, Lewis criticized Bentham\u2019s\nattempt at a calculus of values. For Lewis, the intrinsic value found\nin the experience of a symphony isn\u2019t just the sum of the\nintrinsic value of the movements taken individually, but reflects the\ncharacter of the symphony as a temporal Gestalt. What is\nultimately good for Lewis is the quality of a life found good\nin the living of it. (Lewis 1952b in Lewis 1970, 179) The constituent\nexperiences thus might have value for their own sake, but also value\nfor their contribution to the value of the whole life of which they\nare parts.\n\nHowever, Lewis thought that judgements about how a valued experience\ncontributes to the value of a life as a whole, unlike some terminating\njudgements about how one valued experience will yield another valued\nexperience, are not decisively verifiable or falsifiable. First, any\nattempt to apprehend a life as a whole and the value of it as\nexperienced goes beyond the specious present of experience and relies\non memory and expectation of past and future experience and their\nvalues, and thereby leaves room for error. Second, any attempt to\nsimplify the problem by breaking a whole life into parts and\napprehending their value, and then calculating the probability of\ntheir contributing to a good life as a whole, also leaves room for\nerror.\n\nThe value of an object consists in its potentiality for conducing to\nintrinsically valuable experiences, and is thus a real connection\nbetween objects, persons, and the character of experience, which we\ncan be empirically warranted in accepting on the basis of the\nempirical evidence and the probability on the evidence of such objects\nyielding such intrinsically valuable experiences. For Lewis (1946,\n432), therefore, no object has intrinsic value. Nonetheless, objects\ncan have inherent value in so far as the good which they\nproduce is disclosable in the presence or observation of the object\nitself rather than some other object. Lewis (1946, Ch. 14) contrasted\naesthetic value with cognitive and moral value, not by virtue of\ndistinctive characters of their felt goods, but chiefly by distinctive\nattitudes to experience. The aesthetic attitude is one of\ndisinterested interest in the presented, attentiveness to the given in\nits own right, as opposed to the cognitive attitude\u2019s concern\nwith prediction and significance for future experience, and the\nconcern on the part of the attitude of action or morality with the\npursuit of absent but attainable goods. Thanks to these differences,\naesthetic values in experience tend to be of high degree and long\nlasting and don\u2019t require exclusive possession, and aesthetic\nvalues in objects are inherent ones.\n\nLewis recognized that potentialities are in various ways relative to\nparticular circumstances and manners of observation. There is thus a\nplurality of judgements of the value of objects, of the various ways\nin which they can contribute and fail to contribute to intrinsically\nvaluable experiences, and an apparent contradictory nature to\nincomplete verbal statements of them (e.g., \u201c\\(X\\) is\ngood\u201d, \u201c\\(X\\) isn\u2019t good\u201d). For Lewis\n(1946, 528), issues about the relativity or subjectivity of judgements\nof the value of objects aren\u2019t issues about the empirical truth\nof attributions of value to objects, but just issues about whether the\nconditions under which an object produces directly apprehended value\nare peculiar to the nature and capacities of a particular person and\nthus not indicative of the possibility of similar value finding on the\npart of other persons. Quine (1981) argued that variation within and\namong individuals and societies, and the variable and open ended\ncharacter of what they find valuable, means that predicates like\n\u201cpleases\u201d or \u201c feels good\u201d don\u2019t support\ninductive inferences from case to case in the way that\n\u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cconducts electricity\u201d do.\nSkepticism concerning the prospects for empirical content and\nempirical truth of attributions of value to objects is thus in order.\nLewis (1946, 323), on the other hand, seems to have thought that this\ncontention implies that no one could ever act with empirical warrant\nto improve his own lot in life or do others any good, an absurdity in\nhis view. Lewis argued at length for the possibility of empirically\nwarranted judgements of the social or impersonal value of objects. The\nkey is that \u201cvalue to more than one person is to be assessed as\nif their several experiences were to be included in that of a single\nperson\u201d (Lewis (1946, 550). Rawls (1971, 188\u201390)\ncriticized Lewis for mistaking impersonality for impartiality, and\ndenied the relevance of Lewis\u2019 account of impersonal value for\nquestions of justice, at least, for which impartiality is key. \n\nAn action, for Lewis (1955, 49), is subjectively right, and one we are\nnot to be blamed for doing, if we think it objectively right. An\naction is objectively right if it is correctly judged on the evidence\nthat its consequences are such as it will be right to bring about.\nThat requires that their pursuit violates no categorical\nrational imperative or principle.\n\nLewis (1952b, 1952c, 1955, Chapter 5) outlines categorical rational\nimperatives of doing and thinking, or versions of one rational\nimperative, in various ways, formulations, and detail. The general\nidea is laid out briefly in AKV (Lewis (1946, 480\u201382). To be\nsubject to imperatives is to find a constraint of action or thought in\nwhat is not immediate. To be rational is to be capable of constraint\nby prevision of some future good or ill, and subjection to imperatives\nis simply a feature of living in human terms. Rationality turns on\nconsistency, and the logical is derivative from the rational. Indeed,\nconsistency of thought is for the sake of and aimed at consistency in\naction, which in turn derives from consistency in willing, i.e., of\npurposing and setting a value on. Logical consistency turns on nowhere\nrepudiating that to which we anywhere commit ourselves to in our\nthought, and consistency in general consists in not accepting now what\nwe are unwilling to commit to elsewhere or later. Consistency in what\nwe think and do requires and is required by conformity to\nprinciples. \n\nSo there is a categorical rational imperative of consistency,\n\u201c Be consistent in valuation and in thought and action\u201d\n(Lewis 1946, 481) the basis of which is simply a datum of human\nnature, and a broader imperative of cogency or basing one\u2019s\nbeliefs on cogent reasoning from evidence (Lewis 1952b, 1952c), an\nimperative of prudence, \u201cBe concerned about yourself in future\nand on the whole\u201d, and an imperative of justice, \u201cNo rule\nof action is right except one which is right in all instances and\ntherefore right for everyone\u201d (Lewis 1946, 481\u20132). These\nprinciples are simply a priori explications of the rational\nor moral sense possessed by most humans. Certainly, this might be\nchallenged. In any case, Lewis thinks that where that sense is\nlacking, argument for the principles is pointless, and he concludes\nAKV by claiming that \u201cvaluation is always a matter of empirical\nknowledge\u201d but \u201cwhat is right and what is just can never\nbe determined by empirical facts alone\u201d (Lewis 1946, 554).\n\nThe problem remains of reconciling the imperatives of prudence and\n(social) justice in practice, of reconciling the good for oneself with\nthe good for others in our self-directed, principled, thinking and\ndoing. What aids us is that, through language and civilization, humans\nremember as a species and not merely as individuals. What we are\njustified in thinking thereby is that human achievement and social\nprogress require autonomous, self-criticizing and self-governing\nindividuals, and that individual achievement and realization of\ncherished goods requires membership in a social order of individuals\nco-operating in the pursuit of values cherished in common. The\ncontrast between individual prudence and social justice seems\nfundamental, Lewis concludes, perhaps rather optimistically, only by\nforgetting this (Lewis 1952b).\n",
