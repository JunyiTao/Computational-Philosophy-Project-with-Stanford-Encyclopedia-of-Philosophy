    "main_text": "The Rights and Duties of Gamete Donors || Arguments in Favour of Gamete Donor Parenthood\n1.1 Arguments in Favour of Gamete Donor Parenthood\n\nA common starting point for the claim that gamete donors acquire\nparental responsibilities is to highlight the strong intuitions we\nhave about parenthood in cases other than gamete donation. Normally we\nthink that those who wilfully engage in procreative acts acquire\nparental obligations if children are created as a result. This is true\neven when procreation is unintended, due to faulty contraception for\nexample. The strength of this intuition is used as motivation for\nadopting a causal view of parental obligations. On such views,\ncreating offspring in the right kind of way is sufficient for the\nacquisition of parental responsibilities. Those who think that gamete\ndonors have parental obligations proceed by arguing that the most\nplausible causal accounts of parenthood must include gamete donors\n(Nelson 1999; Fuscaldo 2006; Blustein 1997).\n\nFor instance, Nelson argues that our common-sense understanding of\nmoral responsibility is what best explains our intuitions about\nparenthood following unintentional procreation. On the common-sense\nview, individuals are morally responsible for the consequences of\ntheir free actions when (1) their actions are sufficient to bring\nabout those consequences, and (2) their actions are causally proximate\nto the consequence in question. Gamete donors satisfy these\nconditions. Nelson further argues that gamete donors\u2019 causal\ninvolvement in creating children does not significantly depart from\nthat of unintentional parents (at least not in morally relevant\nrespects) and therefore consistency demands that gamete donors be\nascribed parental responsibilities as well (Nelson 1999, 2014). \n\nAnother route is to argue that reproduction is a special kind of case,\nand that special rules apply when determining what moral\nresponsibilities arise for reproducers. Consider for example what\nDavid Benatar (1999) calls \u2018reproductive autonomy\u2019.\nBenatar argues that individuals\u2019 reproductive autonomy both\nentitles them to make reproductive decisions, and requires them to\ntake responsibility for the consequences of those decisions. He argues\nthat this is a special feature of our ability to reproduce that is not\nfully reducible to genetics or mere causality, and results in a\npresumptive duty to parent the children created from our gametes.\nThis, he argues, best explains why parental responsibilities arise in\naccidental pregnancy cases. Though in some circumstances the\npresumptive duty to parent one\u2019s genetic children may be\noverridden, this is not the case for most instances of gamete\nprovision (Benatar 1999). \n\nOne worry about Benatar\u2019s argument is that it relies heavily on\nstipulating that unique moral features attach to reproduction, and so\nrisks begging the question. Rivka Weinberg (2008) offers an argument\nfor a similar conclusion, but on more general grounds. Weinberg argues\nthat when individuals exercise control over materials that pose grave\nrisks to others (what she calls \u2018hazardous materials\u2019)\nthey are liable for the consequences that arise, regardless of the\nprecautions they take. For instance, the owner of a pet lion is liable\nfor damage done by the lion regardless of the precautions the owner\ntakes to keep the lion contained. Calling this the \u201cHazmat\nTheory\u201d, Weinberg argues that it applies to gametes because\ntheir use can have morally weighty consequences for third parties\n\u2013 namely the children that may result from the union of gametes.\nConsequently, Weinberg argues that gamete providers are obliged to\ncare for the children that result from the voluntary use of their\ngametes (Weinberg 2008). \n\nImportantly, none of the preceding arguments rely on genetic\nrelatedness as grounds for parenthood. It is not the genetic\nsimilarity between gamete donors and their biological offspring that\nis doing the work, but rather considerations about the kind of thing\ngametes are (things that can create people) and how gamete donors use\nthem.\n\nDavid Velleman (2005, 2008), however, does argue that being parented by\nclose genetic relations is of great importance to the wellbeing of\nchildren, and that for this reason we ought to be sceptical of the\nease with which society permits the separation of social parenthood\nfrom biological parenthood. \n",
