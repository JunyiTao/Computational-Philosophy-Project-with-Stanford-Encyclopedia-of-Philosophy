    "main_text": "Hermeneutics\n4. Hermeneutics\n\nA distinctive feature of Tsongkhapa's mature philosophy is the\ncentrality he accords hermeneutics, and the particular stratification\nof philosophical systems it occasions. His focus on hermeneutics stems\nin no small measure from his acceptance of the Kanjur as a true record\nof authentic statements of the Buddha, and also from his wish to\ndiscredit Dolpopa's views. According to Tsongkhapa, and worked out in\ndetail in his Essence of Eloquence, the given record of the\nBuddha's diverse statements seems to contain contradictions, so a\nreader must decide on criteria for interpreting them. No statement of\nthe Buddha can serve as a primary hermeneutic principle, so that\nprinciple necessarily becomes human reason (Sk. yukti, Tib.\nrigs pa).\n\nWhen human reason is brought to bear on the diverse statements of the\nBuddha, it concludes that all statements that an essential or\nintrinsic identity exists, or any statements that presupposes that,\ncannot be taken literally, at face value. This is because human\nreason, when it analyzes the ultimate truth of any object or\nstatement, finds it empty of anything intrinsic to it that would make\nit true. For Tsongkhapa, the line of reasoning that leads most clearly\nto this conclusion is dependent origination.\n\nStatements that require interpretation Tsongkhapa groups into those of\ndifferent Buddhist philosophical schools: in ascending order, Listener\n(Sk. \u015ar\u0101vaka) schools based on older Buddhist\nsources (the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and Sautr\u0101ntika),\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra schools following Asa\u1e45ga and\nDign\u0101ga/Dharmak\u012brti, and non-Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\nMadhyamaka schools following Bh\u0101viveka and\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita. The Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika-madhyamaka\nschool of Candrak\u012brti alone captures the final intention of the\nBuddha. Tsongkhapa was certainly not the first doxographer, but his\nclear and definitive categories had immense influence on later\nwriters, so much so they have anachronistically been read back into\nworks that were written before his time.\n\nTsongkhapa's particular hermeneutics, the primary means he employs to\nlead readers to his philosophical insight, allows him to characterize\nparticular, authentic, Buddhist philosophies as wrong (because they\nare wrong from a Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika perspective), yet right from\nthe perspective of those particular systems. They are right because\nthe philosophies have particular roles to play in a larger, grander\nscheme. This scheme is part of the larger philosophy of a perfect\nperson whose views are in perfect accord (Sk. tath\u0101gata)\nwith the way things are, i.e., dependently originated, and whose\nstatements are motivated solely by the benefit they have to those who\nhear them.\n\nIn this way, Tsongkhapa's hermeneutics lead to, or incorporate, a\nsecond principle, namely, bodhicitta (Sk.). The word\nbodhicitta has at least six different, but interrelated\nmeanings in different contexts (Wangchuk 2007). In his philosophical\nworks Tsongkhapa uses it to mean a universal, altruistic principle\n(not unlike the logos) that explains, primarily, the genesis\nof the Buddha's diverse statements, i.e., explains why a person with\nperfect intellect and powers of expression would make statements that\nseem to contain contradictions.\n\nThis principle plays a central role in Tsongkhapa's assertion that all\nauthentic attainments, without distinction, are based on an authentic\ninsight into emptiness (the seventh of the eight difficult points\nlisted above), and it leads him to assert that the\n\u201corigin\u201d of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na is located in\nbodhicitta, and bodhicitta alone\n",
