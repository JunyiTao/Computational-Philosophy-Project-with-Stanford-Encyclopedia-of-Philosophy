    "main_text": "Origen\u2019s life and work\n1. Origen\u2019s life and work\n\nThe Greek name Origenes signifies \u201cborn of Horus,\u201d an\nEgyptian falcon-headed deity. The Christian scholar of this name was a\nnative of Alexandria (Eusebius, Church History 6.1), though\nit is only his detractor Epiphanius who says that he was also by race\na Copt (Panarion 1.1). Eusebius records the jibe of the\nNeoplatonist Porphyry that Origen, though a Greek by education, became\na Christian, whereas his philosophy teacher Ammonius, having once been\na Christian, converted to a more lawful way of life (Church\nHistory 6.19.7). Although most scholars assume that this is\nAmmonius Saccas, the teacher of Plotinus, there was another\nphilosopher of the same name, who is credited with \u201cunequalled\npolymathy\u201d by the philosopher Longinus at Porphyry, Life of\nPlotinus 20.49\u201350. (For further information see Edwards\n1993: 179.) Eusebius, moreover, asserts that both Origen and his\nteacher were Christians throughout their lives (6.19.10); as evidence\nof the latter\u2019s Christianity in his youth, he records that his\nfather Leontius died as a martyr in 202, and that Origen himself, then\n17, not only exhorted Leontius to persevere but thirsted for the same\ndeath (6.2.7). His mother could curb his enthusiasm only by hiding his\nclothes so that he was ashamed to leave the house (6.2.6). Eusebius\nalso tells us that his sexual diffidence or his ascetic temper induced\nOrigen to make himself literally a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven\n(6.8.2); the act is not unparalleled (Markschies 2007: 15\u201334),\nbut Epiphanius was unable to verify the story (Panarion\n64.2).\n\nAfter his father\u2019s death, Origen devoted himself to scholarship\nand became a notable teacher, perhaps succeeding Clement as head of\nthe catechetical school in Alexandria (Eusebius, Church\nHistory 6.3.1 and 6.7\u20138.1; but cf. Osborn 2008:\n19\u201321). He appears to have studied Hebrew with a converted Jew\n(First Principles 1.3.4 etc.), and one of his letters alludes\nto his studies in philosophy with an unnamed teacher (Eusebius,\nChurch History 6.19.13). Among the works Eusebius says that\nhe composed at this time, dictating to \u201cmore than seven\nstenographers\u201d (6.23.2), were the first five books of his\nCommentary on John, eight books of a Commentary on\nGenesis, two books On the Resurrection and his major\nsurviving work, a synthesis of scriptural teaching under the name\nFirst Principles (6.24). Of these the last survives entire,\nbut only in the Latin of Rufinus. A few books of the Commentary on\nJohn survive in Greek, while portions of the work on the\nresurrection were preserved in a rejoinder by Methodius of Olympia,\nwhich itself survives only in the excerpts and epitomes of later\nauthors (see Dechow 1977). It was also in Alexandria, in imitation of\nthe Homeric scholars of the Hellenistic era, that Origen addressed\nhimself to the preparation of his great Hexapla, in which a corrected\nedition of the Septuagint, the original, allegedly inspired\ntranslation of the Hebrew scriptures (3rd c. BC?), stood in\nparallel to the Hebrew and the renderings of other Greek translators\n(Eusebius, Church History 6.16. See further Neusch\u00e4fer\n1987; Dorival 2013).\n\nAccording to Eusebius, his talents excited the jealousy of Demetrius,\nthe Bishop of Alexandria, who cited his self-castration as a reason\nfor refusing to ordain him as a presbyter (Eusebius, Church\nHistory 6.8.4\u20135). Nevertheless, when Origen left Alexandria\nin 216 to escape the ferocity of the Emperor Caracalla, Demetrius\nrecalled him from Caesarea, where he had already begun to increase his\nreputation (6.19.16\u201319). On a subsequent visit to Caesarea he\nwas ordained a presbyter, and took up residence in the city (6.8.5;\n6.23.4). Having commenced a commentary on the Song of Songs in the\ncourse of a sojourn in Athens (6.32.2), he completed this in Caesarea,\ntogether with his Commentary on Matthew and his refutation of\nthe True Logos, a pagan satire on Christianity written around\n170 by an otherwise unknown Celsus (6.36.2). Never rising above the\nrank of presbyter, he was often employed, according to the custom of\nthe times, as a mouthpiece of orthodoxy in trials of heretics before\nan episcopal synod. Eusebius commends his refutation of Beryllus of\nBostra (6.33), adding that he was summoned to play a similar role in\nArabia (6.37), and that in his books he tore the mask from heresies\nold and new. To this period of his life we should also date the\nDialogue with Heraclides, discovered at Tura in 1951\n(Chadwick 1959). Yet even at the height of his career, his orthodoxy\nwas impugned. Jerome knows of a letter in which he rebuts the\naccusation that he had prophesied the salvation of the devil (Crouzel\n1973); the same letter indicates, according to Jerome, that his\nteachings had given offence to Heraclas, his former student who had\nnow succeeded Demetrius as bishop of Alexandria. It is clear at least\nthat no censure was extended to Dionysius, the successor of Heraclas\nand another of Origen\u2019s pupils. In Caesarea the ageing\ntheologian suffered tortures under Decius in 251 (Eusebius, Church\nHistory 6.39.5) and, according to Eusebius, died as Gallus came\nto the throne in 253 (7.1.1). His assertion that Origen was then in\nhis seventieth year is inconsistent with the date implied for his\nbirth (185). Most scholars have elected to postpone the death of\nOrigen to 254 or 255, without explaining why they think the biographer\nmore likely to have erred with regard to the year of his\nsubject\u2019s birth than that of his death. \n\nHis library in Caesarea was inherited by his admirer Pamphilus, then\nby Eusebius as a disciple of Pamphilus and bishop of that city. It\nalso fell to Eusebius to finish the Apology which Pamphilus\nhad begun to write against Origen\u2019s first detractors. From this\nwork and the philippics of such enemies of Origen as Jerome,\nTheophilus of Alexandria, Epiphanius of Salamis, and the Emperor\nJustinian, we can cull fragments of writings that have otherwise\nperished (see further Clark 1992). We also possess an anthology of\nchoice excerpts from his writings the Philokalia (McLynn\n2004), and two short texts On Prayer and To the\nMartyrs. Much had already been lost by attrition in the time of\nEusebius (died c. 339); more may have perished after Origen was\nanathematized in or around the year 553. Many of Origen\u2019s\nCommentaries and Homilies, like the First Principles, survive\nonly in the Latin of Rufinus, who translated him in the fourth century\nwith reverence but not always with fidelity (see further Pace 1990).\nThe following synopsis of Origen\u2019s thought is based primarily on\nthe extant corpus in Greek and Latin, making use of polemical matter\nonly with the caution that is now enjoined by the most learned\nscholars.\n",
