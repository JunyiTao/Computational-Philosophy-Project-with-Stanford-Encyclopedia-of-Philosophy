    "main_text": "The Laozi Story\n1. The Laozi Story\n\n\nThe Shiji (Records of the Historian) by the Han dynasty (206\nB.C.E.\u2013220 C.E.) court scribe and historian Sima Qian\n(ca. 145\u201386 B.C.E.) offers a \u201cbiography\u201d of\nLaozi. Its reliability has been questioned, but it provides a point of\ndeparture for reconstructing the Laozi story.\n\n\nLaozi was a native of Chu, according to the Shiji, a southern\nstate in the Zhou dynasty (see map and discussion in Loewe and\nShaughnessy 1999, 594 and 597). His surname was Li; his given name was\nEr, and he was also called Dan.\n\n\nLaozi served as a keeper of archival records at the court of\nZhou. Confucius (551\u2013479 B.C.E.) had consulted him on certain\nritual matters, we are told, and praised him lavishly afterward\n(Shiji 63). This establishes the traditional claim that Laozi\nwas a senior contemporary of Confucius. A meeting, or meetings,\nbetween Confucius and Laozi, identified as \u201cLao Dan,\u201d is\nreported also in the Zhuangzi and other early Chinese\nsources.\n\n\n\u201cLaozi cultivated Dao and virtue,\u201d as Sima Qian goes on to\nrelate, and \u201chis learning was devoted to self-effacement and not\nhaving fame. He lived in Zhou for a long time; witnessing the decline\nof Zhou, he departed.\u201d When he reached the northwest border then\nseparating China from the outside world, he met Yin Xi, the official\nin charge of the border crossing, who asked him to put his teachings\ninto writing. The result was a book consisting of some five thousand\nChinese characters, divided into two parts, which discusses \u201cthe\nmeaning of Dao and virtue.\u201d Thereafter, Laozi left; no one knew\nwhere he had gone. This completes the main part of Sima Qian\u2019s\naccount. The remainder puts on record attempts to identify the\nlegendary Laozi with certain known historical individuals and\nconcludes with a list of Laozi\u2019s purported descendants (see W. T. Chan\n1963, Lau 1963, or Henricks 2000 for an English translation).\n\n\nFew scholars today would subscribe fully to the Shiji\nreport. Indeed, according to William Boltz, it \u201ccontains\nvirtually nothing that is demonstrably factual; we are left no choice\nbut to acknowledge the likely fictional nature of the traditional Lao\ntzu [Laozi] figure\u201d (1993, 270). Disagreements abound on every\nfront, including the name Laozi itself. Although the majority takes\n\u201cLaozi\u201d to mean \u201cOld Master,\u201d some scholars\nbelieve that \u201cLao\u201d is a surname. The Zhuangzi and\nother early texts refer to \u201cLao Dan\u201d consistently, but not\n\u201cLi Er.\u201d The name \u201cDan\u201d is generally\nunderstood to depict the bearer\u2019s \u201clong ears,\u201d a mark of\nlongevity in Chinese physiognomy. According to Fung Yu-lan, Sima Qian\nhad \u201cconfused\u201d the legendary Lao Dan with Li Er, who\nflourished later during the \u201cWarring States\u201d period\n(480\u2013221 B.C.E.) and was the \u201creal\u201d founder of the\nDaoist school (daojia) (1983, 171).\n\n\nIn an influential essay, A. C. Graham (1986) argues that the story of\nLaozi reflects a conflation of different legends. The earliest strand\nrevolved around the meeting of Confucius with Lao Dan and was current\nby the fourth century B.C.E. During the first half of the third\ncentury, Lao Dan was recognized as a great thinker in his own right\nand as the founder of a distinct \u201cLaoist\u201d school of\nthought. It was not until the Han dynasty, when the teachings of\nLaozi, Zhuangzi, and others were seen to share certain insights\ncentering on the concept of Dao, that they were classified together\nunder the rubric of philosophical \u201cDaoism.\u201d\n\n\nI cite these views here only to give a sense of the diversity and\nvolume of research on the Laozi story. It is clear that by 100\nB.C.E. if not earlier, Laozi was already shrouded in legends and that\nSima Qian could only exercise his judgment as an historian to put\ntogether a report that made sense to him, based on the different and\nsometimes competing sources at his disposal.\n\n\nThe fact that Laozi appears favorably in both Confucian and Daoist\nsources seems to argue against the likelihood that the figure was\nfabricated for polemical purposes. It is conceivable that a\nphilosopher known as Lao Dan attracted a following based on his novel\nreading of the Way and virtue. Deferentially, his followers would\nrefer to him as \u201cLaozi.\u201d\n\n\nConfucius had sought his advice presumably on mourning and funeral\nrites, given that the Confucian work Liji (Records of Rites)\nhas Confucius citing Lao Dan four times specifically on these\nrites. Indeed, various dates have been proposed for the\nencounter\u2014for example, 501 B.C.E., following the account in\nthe Zhuangzi (ch. 14). In any case, testifying to its appeal,\ndifferent accounts of the meeting circulated among the educated elite\nduring the Warring States period. Other details then came to be\nassociated with Lao Dan, which formed the basis of Sima Qian\u2019s\nreconstruction.\n\n\nAdmittedly, this is conjecture. Though I find little reason not to\naccept the traditional claim that Laozi was a senior contemporary of\nConfucius, the identity of the \u201cOld Master\u201d no doubt will\ncontinue to attract and divide scholarly opinion. In many popular\naccounts, Laozi is described as the \u201cfounder\u201d or\n\u201cfather\u201d of \u201cDaoism.\u201d This begs a number of\nquestions and therefore should not be taken uncritically, and this is\nthe reason why a fairly extended discussion of the Shiji\nLaozi story is offered here.\n\n\nThe story of Laozi occupies a cherished place in the Daoist\ntradition. It is important also because it raises certain hermeneutic\nexpectations and affects the way in which the Laozi is\nread. If the work was written by a single author, one might expect,\nfor example, a high degree of consistency in style and content. If\nthe Laozi was a work of the sixth or fifth century B.C.E.,\none might interpret certain sayings in the light of what we know of\nthe period. There is little consensus among scholars, however, on the\ndate or authorship of the Laozi, as we shall see below.\n\n\nWith the arrival of the \u201cWay of the Celestial Masters\u201d\n(tianshidao), the first organized religious Daoist\nestablishment (daojiao) in the second century C.E., the story\nof Laozi gained an important hagiographic dimension.\n\n\nThe founding of \u201cCelestial Master\u201d or \u201cHeavenly\nMaster\u201d Daoism was based on a new revelation of the Dao by Laozi\n(on which see Kohn 1998a and 1998b, Kleeman 2016, and the\nentry on \n  religious Daoism). In the eyes of\nthe faithful, the Dao is a\ndivine reality, and Laozi is seen as the personification of the\nDao. Lao Dan is but one manifestation of the divine Laozi, albeit a\npivotal one because of the writing of the Daodejing, which in\nreligious Daoism commands devotion as a foundational scripture that\npromises not only wisdom but also immortality and salvation to those\nwho submit to its power. During the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 C.E.),\nthe imperial Li family traced its ancestry to Laozi. Today, Laozi\u2019s\n\u201cbirthday\u201d is celebrated in many parts of Asia on the\nfifteenth day of the second lunar month.\n\n\nThe influence of the Laozi on Chinese culture is both deep\nand far-reaching. One indication of its enduring appeal and\nhermeneutical openness is the large number of commentaries devoted to\nit throughout Chinese history\u2014some seven hundred, according to\none count (W. T. Chan 1963, 77). The Laozi has inspired an\nintellectual movement known as xuanxue, \u201cLearning in\nthe Profound\u201d\u2014or \u201cNeo-Daoism,\u201d as some\nscholars prefer, emphasizing its roots in classical Daoism\u2014that\ndominated the Chinese elite or high culture from the third to the\nsixth century C.E. (See the entry on \u201cNeo-Daoism\u201d in\nthis Encyclopedia.) The Laozi played a significant\nrole in informing not only philosophic thought but also the\ndevelopment of literature, calligraphy, painting, music, martial arts,\nand other cultural traditions.\n\n\nImperial patronage enhanced the prestige of the Laozi and\nenlarged its scope of influence. In 733 C.E., the emperor Xuanzong\ndecreed that all officials should keep a copy of\nthe Daodejing at home and placed the classic on the list of\ntexts to be examined for the civil service examinations (see, e.g.,\nthe report in the official Tang history, Jiu Tang shu 8). In\nreligious Daoism, recitation of the Daodejing is a prescribed\ndevotional practice and features centrally in ritual\nperformance. The Daodejing has been set to music from an\nearly time. The term \u201cLaozi learning\u201d\n(Laoxue) has come to designate an important field of study. A\nuseful work in Chinese that sketches the major landmarks in this\ndevelopment is Zhongguo Laoxue shi (A History\nof Laozi Learning in China) (Xiong Tieji, et al. 1995); a\nfollow-up effort focusing on Laozi scholarship in the\ntwentieth century by the same lead author was published in 2002.\n\n\nThe influence of the Laozi extends beyond China, as Daoism\nreaches across Asia and in the modern period, the Western world. In\nHong Kong, Taiwan, and among the Chinese in Southeast Asia and beyond,\nDaoism is a living tradition. Daoist beliefs and practices have\ncontributed also to the formation of Korean and Japanese culture,\nalthough here the process of cultural transmission, assimilation, and\ntransformation is complex, especially given the close interaction\namong Daoism, Buddhism, and indigenous traditions such as Shint\u014d\n(see Fukui, et al. 1983, vol. 3).\n\n\nDuring the seventh century, the Laozi was translated into\nSanskrit; in the eighteenth century a Latin translation was brought to\nEngland, after which there has been a steady supply of translations\ninto Western languages, yielding a handsome harvest of some 250\n(LaFargue and Pas 1998, 277), with new ones still hitting bookstores\nand internet sites almost every year. Some of the more notable recent\ntranslations in English are Roberts 2001, Ivanhoe 2002, Ames and Hall\n2003, Wagner 2003, Moeller 2007, Ryden and Penny 2008, and Kim 2012. A\nforthcoming translation is Minford 2018.\n\n\nLaozi is an \u201caxial\u201d philosopher whose insight helps shape\nthe course of human development, according to Karl Jaspers (1974). The\ninfluence of the Laozi on Western thinkers is the subject of\nClarke 2000. Memorable phrases from the Laozi such as\n\u201cgoverning a large country is like cooking a small fish\u201d\n(ch. 60) have found their way into global political rhetoric. At the\npopular level, several illustrated or \u201ccomic\u201d versions of\nthe Laozi reach out to a younger and wider readership (e.g.,\nTsai Chih Chung, et al. 1995, now available also on YouTube). Some may\nhave come to learn about the Laozi through such best-selling\nworks as The Tao of Physics (Capra 1975) or The Tao of\nPooh (Hoff 1982); and there is also A Taoist Cookbook\n(Saso 1994), which comes with \u201cmeditations\u201d from\nthe Daodejing. From nature lovers to management gurus, a\ngrowing audience is discovering that the Laozi has something\nto offer to them. The reception of the Laozi in modern Asia\nand the West falls outside the scope of this article; nevertheless, it\nis important to note that the Laozi should be regarded not\nonly as a work of early Chinese philosophy, but also in a larger\ncontext as a classic of world literature with keen contemporary\nrelevance.\n\n\nThe next three sections are intended for readers who are interested in\nthe textual history and commentarial tradition of the Laozi,\nincluding the major manuscripts recovered through archaeological\nexcavations or from the antiquities market. They are important to\nunderstanding the Laozi, but one may go directly to section 5\non the main interpretive approaches to the text if one wishes to\nbypass them.\n",
