    "main_text": "\n\nWhy are you always lying? Why did the Ancient Egyptians mummify their\ndead? Should Huck Finn have turned Jim in? Why is she selling her car?\nQuestions that ask for reasons, and in particular, reasons for action,\nare among the commonest questions humans have. Philosophers have\nsought to understand the nature of such reasons. Most contemporary\nphilosophers start by distinguishing two types of reason for action:\n\u201cnormative\u201d reasons\u2014that is, reasons which, very\nroughly, favour or justify an action, as judged by a well-informed,\nimpartial observer; and \u201cmotivating\u201d reasons\u2014which,\nagain roughly, are reasons the \u201cagent\u201d (that is, the\nperson acting) takes to favour and justify her action and that guides\nher in acting. But there are, in addition, \u201cexplanatory\u201d\nreasons, reasons that explain an action without necessarily justifying\nit and without being the reasons that motivated the agent.\n\nA clear understanding of reasons for action in their justifying,\nmotivating and explanatory functions is of relevance to the philosophy\nof action, to ethics, political philosophy and the philosophy of law.\nThe essential issues about reasons\u2014what they are, and how they\nrelate to human actions\u2014are of wider concern.\n\nThis entry examines the various accounts that philosophers have given\nof these different kinds of reasons and their interconnections, as\nwell as the disagreements among them about these matters. The focus\nwill be on reasons for acting\u2014what are commonly called\n\u201cpractical reasons\u201d, leaving aside questions that are\nspecific to other reasons, for instance, reasons for believing,\nwanting, feeling emotions, and having attitudes, such as hope or\nresentment.\n",
