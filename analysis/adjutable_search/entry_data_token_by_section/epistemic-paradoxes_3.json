    "main_text": "The Surprise Test Paradox || The Problem of Foreknowledge\n1.3 The Problem of Foreknowledge\n\nPrior knowledge of an action seems incompatible with it being a free\naction. If I know that you will finish reading this article tomorrow,\nthen you will finish tomorrow (because knowledge implies truth). But\nthat means you will finish the article even if you resolve not to.\nAfter all, given that you will finish, nothing can stop you from\nfinishing. So if I know that you will finish reading this article\ntomorrow, you are not free to do otherwise.\n\nMaybe all of your reading is compulsory. If God exists, then He knows\neverything. So the threat to freedom becomes total for the theist. The\nproblem of divine foreknowledge raises the possibility that theism\n(rather than atheism) precludes free choice and thereby precludes our having any moral responsibility.\n\nIn response to the apparent conflict between freedom and\nforeknowledge, medieval philosophers denied that future contingent\npropositions have a truth-value. They took themselves to be extending\na solution Aristotle discusses in De Interpretatione to the\nproblem of logical fatalism. According to this truth-value gap\napproach, \u2018You will finish this article tomorrow\u2019 is not\ntrue now. The prediction will become true tomorrow.\nA morally serious theist can agree with the Rubaiyat of Omar\nKhayyam:\n\nThe Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\n\nMoves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit\n\nShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\n\nNor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.\n\n\nGod\u2019s omniscience only requires that He knows every true\nproposition. God will know \u2018You will finish this article\ntomorrow\u2019 as soon it becomes true \u2013 but not before.\n\nThe teacher has freewill. Therefore, predictions about what he will do\nare not true (prior to the examination). The metaphysician Paul Weiss\n(1952) concludes that the student\u2019s argument falsely assumes he\nknows that the announcement is true. The student can know that the\nannouncement is true after it becomes true \u2013 but not\nbefore.\n\nThe logician W. V. O. Quine (1953) agrees with Weiss\u2019 conclusion\nthat the teacher\u2019s announcement of a surprise test fails to give\nthe student knowledge that there will be a surprise test. Yet Quine\nabominates Weiss\u2019 reasoning. Weiss breeches the law of bivalence\n(which states that every proposition has a truth-value, true or\nfalse). Quine believes that the riddle of the surprise test should not\nbe answered by surrendering classical logic.\n",
