No one can deny that cultural\ninheritance is an important factor in explaining how our species has\nchanged over time. In spite of all this, one might still worry that it\nis a mistake to understand the importance of culture using the tools\nof evolutionary theory. This is because one may be skeptical of the\nexistence of a theory that is both general enough to cover all forms\nof cultural change and informative enough to be enlightening.\n\nThere is no doubt that it is often important to remind\noverly-enthusiastic orthodox Darwinians of the importance of culture.\nFor example, it seems that the increased incidence of\nlactose-tolerance among human populations has arisen as a consequence\nof a cultural innovation\u2014namely dairy farming. The relatively\nrecent appearance of this genetically-controlled adaptation\ndemonstrates that human physiological nature is something that\ncontinues to change, and it also demonstrates the causal impact of\nculture on genes (Richerson & Boyd 2005: 191\u201392). Such\nexamples by themselves show the rashness of any view that claims\neither that human nature has remained fixed since the Stone Age, or\nthat genes are somehow in the evolutionary driving seat. Yet none of\nthis shows that we can develop a general, informative theory of\ncultural evolution. One might fear that, in the end, the influence of\nculture on aspects of the human species is best understood through a\nseries of more idiosyncratic narratives.\n\nOur brief examination of memetics illustrated this concern. We gain no\nreal explanatory insight if we are told that ideas spread through\npopulations, some more successfully than others. We want to know what\nmakes some ideas fitter than others. And it is not clear that there\nwill be any general rules that can help us to answer this question. In\nthe biological realm, we need detailed accounts of local environmental\ncircumstances, species-specific physiology and anatomy, and so forth,\nto tell us what makes one organic variant fitter than another.\nSimilarly, in the cultural realm we need to look at local\npsychological dispositions to explain why some ideas are more likely\nto spread than others. Thus any explanatory value to be had from\ncultural evolution may be parasitic on conventional work done in\npsychology. And if individual preferences are subject to change over\ntime, then there may be no general and informative theory of cultural\nevolution to be had; rather, we will have to settle for local\nexplanations that look to shifting preferences. Rather than provide a\nnew scientific framework for an understanding of culture, cultural\nevolution will tend to degenerate into conventional narrative cultural\nhistory (Fracchia & Lewontin 1999).\n\nIn a useful article, Elliott Sober (1991) suggests that theories of\ncultural evolution may have limited value for the work of social\nscientists, on the grounds that social scientists are primarily\ninterested in explaining what makes individuals likely to adopt one\nidea, rather than another. Perhaps culture is composed of replicating\nentities struggling against various selection pressures, but what\ninsight does this offer us, if in the end it presents us with nothing\nmore than an alternative idiom in which to describe the various\nfactors that affect the evaluation of culture? Perhaps clothes\nfashions are memes, but even if that is the case, one still needs to\nexplain what makes one clothing meme fitter than another, and the fear\nis that once spelled out this will quickly boil down to a well-known\nappeal to consumer psychology.\n\nOnce again, Dennett (2017) has offered a response on behalf of the\nmemetic approach, but it serves as a potential response from cultural\nevolutionary theorists more broadly. He draws attention to the risks\nof assuming an overly rational perspective on the factors influencing\nthe uptake of cultural traits: one should not assume that ideas are\nwidely adopted because they are understood and explicitly endorsed by\nthose who adopt them; one should not assume that technological\ninnovation occurs because users or designers understand the nature of\nthe contribution made by some novel variant. If, as Darwin argued, the\nselection, preservation and augmentation of organic variation (in the\nearly stages of domestication, for example) can sometimes be\nunconscious, it follows that the selection, preservation and\naugmentation of cultural variation can sometimes be unconscious,\ntoo.\n\nRicherson and Boyd respond in a different, albeit complementary way.\nThey say that Sober\u2019s argument assumes, erroneously, that\n\u201cwe are all good intuitive population thinkers\u201d (Richerson\n& Boyd 2005: 97). In Sober\u2019s original article he points out\nthat population thinking might save cultural evolutionary models from\nvacuity in just this way:\n\n\nSo the question about the usefulness of these models of cultural\nevolution to the day-to-day research of social scientists comes to\nthis: Are social scientists good at intuitive population thinking? If\nthey are, then their explanations will not be undermined by precise\nmodels of cultural evolution. If they are not, then social scientists\nshould correct their explanations (and the intuitions on which they\nrely) by studying these models. (Sober 1991: 492)\n\n",
