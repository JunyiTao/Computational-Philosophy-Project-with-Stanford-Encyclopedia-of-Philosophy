    "main_text": "Applications of the Logistic Method || The Logic of Sense and Denotation\n3.5 The Logic of Sense and Denotation\n\nChurch\u2019s (1943a) review of Carnap\u2019s Introduction to\nSemantics (1942) constitutes an important early step in the\napplication of the logistic method to the subject of semantics (see\nalso Church 1943c, 1951b, 1952, 1956a). Like Frege, Church believed\nthat the Sinn or sense of an expression is an\nobjective\u2014i.e., mind-and-language\nindependent\u2014abstract entity (cf.\n \u00a73.3\n and\n \u00a76.3)\n and that senses are needed in semantics for their power to explain\nthe informative nature of identity statements containing\nco-designating names, as well as to explain the failure of the\nsubstitutivity of co-designating names in intensional contexts (1943a;\n1956a: \u00a701). Moreover, Church also shared Frege\u2019s highly\ncontroversial view that in addition to assigning senses to expressions\nin scientific language, one should also assign them to expressions in\nnatural language. (See\n supplement E\n for discussion.)\n\nHowever, given that senses and propositions are objective, one might\nwonder whether theorizing about them via the logistic method should\nreally proceed indirectly, via the study of\nintensional semantic theories of possible languages (again, see\n supplement E),\n or whether the logistic method should instead study senses\ndirectly by theorizing about how these entities are related\nto one another and to the designata that they determine.\nChurch himself distinguishes these two approaches and claims that if a\ntheory could be formulated in a satisfactory way using the direct\nmethod, then \u201cit should be a comparatively simple matter to\ndevise a language with the desired sort of semantics\u201d (1979 [BE:\n807]). He pursued this direct approach in his papers on the Logic\nof Sense and Denotation or \u201cLSD\u201d (1946b, 1951a,\n1973b, 1974a, 1993).\n\nThe fundamental difference between the intensional semantic approach\nto language and the direct LSD approach to senses can be seen from the\nfollowing. Church\u2019s view that the sense assigned to a name by a\nsemantic theory is univocal raises the question of\nwhich sense to assign to \u201cHesperus\u201d. Further,\nnames can occur not only in customary contexts like\n\n(1)\nHesperus is a planet\n\n\nbut also in indirect contexts such as:\n\n(2)\nHammurabi believes that (1).\n\n\nWhich sense do we assign to \u201cHesperus\u201d in (2)? From the\nperspective of a Fregean semantic theory, this question has the\nfollowing answer. First, we distinguish the expression\n\u201cHesperus\u201d from an occurrence of it in a\nnon-customary syntactic position such as in (2). Secondly, we assign a\nnon-customary sense to its occurrence in (2) so that this occurrence\nexpresses not the customary sense of \u201cHesperus\u201d (say,\nthe first planet visible in the evening) but its indirect\nsense. Thirdly, we claim that this indirect sense determines the\nexpression\u2019s customary sense as the designatum of the\nnon-customary occurrence (cf. Frege 1892a; Salm\u00f3n 1993).\nHowever, such subtleties will require us to complicate the background\nlogic. In this case, we have to prohibit the application of Leibniz\nlaw to indirect contexts; this is because names with the same\ncustomary designatum but different customary senses cannot be\nsubstituted salva veritate within contexts where they\ndesignate their customary senses. For example, (2) can be true while\n(2*) is false:\n\n(2*)\nHammurabi believes that Phosphorus is a planet.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of LSD, these complications pertaining to\nindirect contexts can be avoided by replacing the occurrence of\n\u201cHesperus\u201d in (2) with a new name; and likewise for all\nother occurrences that would be assigned a non-customary\ndesignatum were we still working in a semantic theory. For\nexample, we can replace the customary occurrence of\n\u201cHesperus\u201d in (1) with a constant \u201c\\(a_0\\)\u201d\nand replace the non-customary occurrence of \u201cHesperus\u201d in\n(2) with \u201c\\(a_1\\)\u201d. This raises the question of the\nrelationship between these constants.\n\nLSD was originally formulated in a simply typed \u03bb-calculus (of\nthe kind described in\n supplement D),\n which allows the subject matter of the theory to be sorted into\nvarious type hierarchies. Individuals (like Hesperus) are of type\n\\(\\iota_0\\). Senses (which Church calls \u201cconcepts\u201d) that\ndetermine individuals\u2014i.e., \u201cindividual\nconcepts\u201d\u2014are of type \\(\\iota_1\\) etc. In another\nhierarchy, truth values are of type \\(o_0\\), concepts of truth\nvalues\u2014i.e., propositions\u2014are of type \\(o_1\\), concepts of\npropositions\u2014i.e., \u201cpropositional\nconcepts\u201d\u2014are of type \\(o_2\\) etc. (Individuals are\ndesignated by constants, truth values are designated by sentences\nwhile propositions are designated by complex names corresponding to\n\u201cthat\u201d-clauses.) In addition to typed hierarchies of\nconcepts of individuals and concepts of truth values, there is also a\nhierarchy of functions and concepts of functions; for any types\n\\(\\alpha_k\\) and \\(\\beta_k\\), there exists a type\n\\(\\ulcorner\\)(\\(\\alpha_k\\) \\(\\beta_k )\\urcorner\\) of functions from\nentities of \\(\\beta_k\\) to entities of type \\(\\alpha_k\\).\n\nIn this framework, \u201c\\(a_0\\)\u201d designates an individual of\ntype \\(\\iota_0\\) and expresses an individual concept of type\n\\(\\iota_1\\). Further, \u201c\\(a_1\\)\u201d designates this individual\nconcept in virtue of expressing a concept of type \\(\\iota_2\\) of the\nindividual concept. However, and crucially, in LSD this concept of\ntype \\(\\iota_2\\) is not the Fregean indirect sense of\n\u201c\\(a_0\\)\u201d; rather, it is a distinct semantic primitive\nthat is assigned to \u201c\\(a_1\\)\u201d only. How, then, are these\nconcepts related?\n\nChurch tells us that there is a relation \\(\\Delta\\) that holds between\nconcepts of each type within a hierarchy and the entities of the type\nimmediately below it, for example between a concept of type\n\\(\\iota_2\\) and another concept of \\(\\iota_1\\). But something more\nneeds to be said to illuminate the nature of this relationship. This\nis because although it helps to increase the numerical value of a\nsubscript in order to remove ambiguity from our notation and indicate\na corresponding increase in type, this provides little or no\ninsight into the relationships among the concepts themselves,\nwhich are neither related by the numerical successor relation, nor\ndependent for their existence and identity on the notation for them.\nMoreover, expressing concepts may require adding new expressions to\nthe language, so not everything can be expressed using a fixed\nvocabulary like the numerals.\n\nThis bring us to an objection, which arises from the fact that\nintensional contexts can be iterated:\n\n(1)\nHesperus is a planet\n(2)\nHammurabi believes that (1)\n(3)\nMonica said that (2)\n\u00a0\nAd infinitum.\n\n\nReplacing such constructions with the corresponding ones in LSD\nrequires an infinity of independent names,\n\u201cHesperus0\u201d\u2014\u201cHesperusn\u201d,\ncorresponding to the occurrences of \u201cHesperus\u201d in (1),\n(2), (3), etc. If these names named an infinity of primitive and\nindependent concepts, Church\u2019s proposal would be subject to the\nobjection that a language for which LSD was a semantic theory could\nnot be learned (Davidson 1965). To meet this objection, something more\nneeds to be said about the nature of the relation \\(\\Delta\\). The\nissue is discussed in\n supplement E,\n as are Church\u2019s numerous other achievements in the philosophy\nof language.\n\nA more formidable problem is that John Myhill was able to derive a\nversion of the so-called \u201cRussell-Myhill paradox (RM)\u201d\nwithin Church\u2019s initial formulation of LSD (see Myhill 1958). In\nresponse, Church reformulated LSD by ramifying the relation \\(\\Delta\\)\n(1973\u20134). In response, Anderson (1987) showed that the source of\nthe inconsistency of LSD lay in its axioms. We turn to the subject of\nantinomy and paradox and their impact on Church\u2019s work in the\nnext section.\n\nBefore we do so, it should be noted that LSD had some influence on the\ndevelopment of intensional logic. Both Kaplan (1964) and Montague\n(1969, 1970b) built on Church\u2019s work, combining type theory with\nCarnap\u2019s (1947) notion of an intension as a function from worlds\nto extensions. However, to the extent that Kaplan and Montague favored\nCarnap\u2019s notion of an intension they disagreed with Church\nhimself, who rejected this notion and treated senses along the same\nlines as Frege (again, see\n supplement E).\n Anderson (1980, 1987, 2001), Klement (2002), T. Parsons (2001) and\nSalm\u00f3n (2010) follow Frege and Church more closely. Bealer\n(1982) also responded to Church. (See also the entry on\n intensional logic.)\n",
