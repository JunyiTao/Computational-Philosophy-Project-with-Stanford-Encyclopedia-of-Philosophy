    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Ethics and Politics || Late Romanticism\n4.5 Late Romanticism\n\nStatements such as Blake\u2019s claim, \u201cPrinces\u2026and\nHouses of Commons & Houses of Lords [are] something Else besides\nHuman Life\u201d (\u201cPublic Address\u201d (1809) in PPWB) clearly display\nthe revolutionary nature of the romantics. But the romantic transition\nfrom a more liberal framework to a more conservative one is explained\nprimarily by their reaction to the terror of the French revolution.\nThough many of the romantics kept allegiance to the revolution until\nfairly late (1798), the acknowledgement of its failures and the\ndangers involved in any revolutionary act led them to modify, though\nnot to renounce, their republican ideal. Even during this stage of\ntheir development, the romantics believed that the republic offered\nthe best political structure. But, while still involving democratic\nelements, a proper republic, they argued should also involve\naristocratic and monarchical elements because the educated should rule\nover the uneducated:\n\n\nA perfect republic would have to be not just democratic but\naristocratic and monarchic at the same time: to legislate justly and\nfreely, the educated would have to outweigh and guide the uneducated,\nand everything would have to be organized into an absolute whole. (F.\nSchlegel, AF: #214)\n\n\nRather than opposed to the original romantic ideal, this late view is\na natural outgrowth of the earlier ideal since it does not only\nmaintain the early republicanism, but also continues, through\nmodification, the early romantic emphasis on Bildung as a\nnecessary condition for a proper republic.\n\nSince even during this later period, the romantic political ideal\nconsisted of a republican, holistic community grounded in love, art\nand aesthetics still played significant ethical and political roles in\nthe late romantic phase. Even later on in their careers, the romantics\ninsisted that art and aesthetics were crucial models and resources for\nthe pursuit of ethical and political ends.\n",
