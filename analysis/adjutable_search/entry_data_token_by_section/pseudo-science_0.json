    "main_text": "The purpose of demarcations\n1. The purpose of demarcations\n\nDemarcations of science from pseudoscience can be made for both\ntheoretical and practical reasons (Mahner 2007, 516). From a\ntheoretical point of view, the demarcation issue is an illuminating\nperspective that contributes to the philosophy of science in much the same\nway that the study of fallacies contributes to our knowledge of informal\nlogic and rational argumentation. From a practical point of view, the\ndistinction is important for decision guidance in both private and\npublic life. Since science is our most reliable source of knowledge in\na wide range of areas, we need to distinguish scientific knowledge\nfrom its look-alikes. Due to the high status of science in present-day\nsociety, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of various\nclaims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the\ndemarcation issue pressing in many areas. The demarcation issue is\ntherefore important in practical applications such as the\nfollowing:\n\nClimate policy: The scientific consensus on ongoing\nanthropogenic climate change leaves no room for reasonable doubt (Cook\net al. 2016; Powell 2019). Science denial has considerably delayed\nclimate action, and it is still one of the major factors that impede\nefficient measures to reduce climate change (Oreskes and Conway 2010;\nLewandowsky et al. 2019). Decision-makers and the public need to know\nhow to distinguish between competent climate science and\nscience-mimicking disinformation on the climate.\nEnvironmental policies: In order to be on the safe\nside against potential disasters it may be legitimate to take\npreventive measures when there is valid but yet insufficient evidence\nof an environmental hazard. This must be distinguished from taking\nmeasures against an alleged hazard for which there is no valid\nevidence at all.  Therefore, decision-makers in environmental policy\nmust be able to distinguish between scientific and pseudoscientific\nclaims.\nHealthcare: Medical science develops and evaluates\ntreatments according to evidence of their effectiveness and\nsafety. Pseudoscientific activities in this area give rise to\nineffective and sometimes dangerous interventions. Healthcare\nproviders, insurers, government authorities and \u2013 most\nimportantly \u2013 patients need guidance on how to distinguish\nbetween medical science and medical pseudoscience.\nExpert testimony: It is essential for the rule of law\nthat courts get the facts right. The reliability of different types of\nevidence must be correctly determined, and expert testimony must be\nbased on the best available knowledge. Sometimes it is in the interest\nof litigants to present non-scientific claims as solid science.\nTherefore courts must be able to distinguish between science and\npseudoscience. Philosophers have often had prominent roles in the\ndefence of science against pseudoscience in such contexts. (Pennock\n2011) \nScience education: The promoters of some\npseudosciences (notably creationism) try to introduce their teachings\nin school curricula. Teachers and school authorities need to have\nclear criteria of inclusion that protect students against unreliable\nand disproved teachings.\nJournalism: When there is scientific uncertainty, or\nrelevant disagreement in the scientific community, this should be\ncovered and explained in media reports on the issues in\nquestion. Equally importantly, differences of opinion between on the\none hand legitimate scientific experts and on the other hand\nproponents of scientifically unsubstantiated claims should be\ndescribed as what they are. Public understanding of topics such as\nclimate change and vaccination has been considerably hampered by\norganised campaigns that succeeded in making media portray standpoints\nthat have been thoroughly disproved in science as legitimate\nscientific standpoints (Boykoff and Boykoff 2004; Boykoff 2008). The\nmedia need tools and practices to distinguish between legitimate\nscientific controversies and attempts to peddle pseudoscientific\nclaims as science.\n\n\nAttempts to define what we today call science have a long history, and\nthe roots of the demarcation problem have sometimes been traced back\nto Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics (Laudan\n1983). Cicero\u2019s arguments for dismissing certain methods of divination\nin his De divinatione has considerable similarities with\nmodern criteria for the demarcation of science (Fernandez-Beanato\n2020).  However it was not until the 20th century that influential\ndefinitions of science have contrasted it against\npseudoscience. Philosophical work on the demarcation problem seems to\nhave waned after Laudan\u2019s (1983) much noted death certificate\naccording to which there is no hope of finding a necessary and\nsufficient criterion of something as heterogeneous as scientific\nmethodology. In more recent years, the problem has been\nrevitalized. Philosophers attesting to its vitality maintain that the\nconcept can be clarified by other means than necessary and sufficient\ncriteria (Pigliucci 2013; Mahner 2013) or that such a definition is\nindeed possible although it has to be supplemented with\ndiscipline-specific criteria in order to become fully operative\n(Hansson 2013).\n",
