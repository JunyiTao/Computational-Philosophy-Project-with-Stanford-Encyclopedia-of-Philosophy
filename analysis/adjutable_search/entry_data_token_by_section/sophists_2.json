    "main_text": "Religion\n3. Religion\n\n\nFrom its beginnings, Greek speculations about the origin and nature\nof the cosmos had a theological dimension, in that various early\nthinkers attributed divinity either to the cosmos as a whole (as in\nHeraclitus\u2019 \u2018ever-living fire\u2019 (DK 31B30)) or to the\nfundamental cosmic principle or principles (so Anaximander is reported\nas regarding the Infinite (DK 12A15 (Aristotle)) and Anaximenes air (DK\n13A10 (Aetius, Cicero)) as divine, that is, eternal and intelligent).\nSuch speculations were not without their implications for the\ntraditional Olympian pantheon; Xenophanes clearly intends to mock the\ncultural relativity of anthropomorphism, pointing out that different\nraces of humans depict their gods in their own image, and suggesting\nthat if horses and cattle could draw they would do the same (DK\n21B15\u201316). On the positive side he proclaims a single supreme\nnon-anthropomorphic divinity, which appears to be identified either\nwith the cosmos itself or with its intelligent directive force (DK\n21B23\u20136). This type of theology is naturalistic, but non-reductive;\nHeraclitus is not saying that God is nothing but cosmic fire, implying\nthat that fire is not really divine, but rather that divinity, or the\ndivinities that matter, is not a super-hero like Apollo, but the\neverlasting, intelligent, self-directing cosmos itself. In the fifth\ncentury the naturalistic approach to religion exhibits a more reductive\naspect, with a consequent move towards a world-view which is not merely\nnaturalistic, but in the modern sense secular. Some sophists\ncontributed to that process of secularisation.\n\n\nIt is convenient to start with Anaxagoras, who, though not generally\ncounted as a sophist, in that he did not offer instruction in how to\nlive or teach rhetoric, nevertheless shared the scientific interests of\nsophists such as Hippias, and personified the growing rationalistic\napproach to natural phenomena. When he said that the sun was a molten\nrock, larger than the Peloponnese (Diogenes Laertius II.8, cf. Plato, Apology\n26d), he did mean that it was nothing other than a rock, i.e., not a\ndivine being, and he was rightly considered as challenging traditional\nviews of natural phenomena as divinely significant. Plutarch\u2019s\nstory (Life of Pericles 6) of the one-horned ram neatly\nencapsulates the opposed world-views: a ram with one horn in the middle\nof its forehead was brought to Pericles, and the soothsayer Lampon\ninterpreted it as a portent signifying the forthcoming triumph of\nPericles in his political struggle with his rival Thucydides.\nAnaxagoras dissected the animal\u2019s skull and showed that the\nsingle horn grew naturally out of a deformity of the brain. So,\nPlutarch reports, the people admired Anaxagoras (but admired Lampon\neven more when Thucydides was ostracized soon afterwards). The\nnaturalistic approach to meteorology etc. is not as such inconsistent\nwith belief in divinities, and though Anaxagoras does not explicitly\ndescribe his cosmic Nous as divine, his description of it as\nknowing, controlling and organizing everything (DK 59B12) strongly\nsuggests that he thought that it was. Among the phenomena for which\nreductive explanations were offered in the fifth century was the origin\nof religious belief itself. There is an indication of this in\nDemocritus DK 68B30 (preserved by Clement of Alexandria): \u2018A few\nlearned people, holding up their hands towards what we Greeks now call\nthe air, said \u201cZeus thinks of all things and he knows all things\nand gives and takes away, and he is king of all things\u201d\u2009\u2019,\nwhich is supported by the testimony of Sextus (Against the Mathematicians IX.24) that\nDemocritus said that belief in gods arose when primitive people were\nfrightened by thunder, lightning and other celestial phenomena. An\nalternative account, or rather two accounts, equally reductive, of the\norigin of religion is attributed to Prodicus, who is reported by\nvarious sources as holding that the names of gods were originally\napplied either to things which are particularly important in human\nlife, such as the sun, rivers, kinds of crops etc., or else to the\npeople who had originally discovered things of that kind (DK 84B5). It\nwas presumably on the basis of this that Prodicus was counted as an\natheist in antiquity (Aetius I.7.1, Cicero De Natura Deorum I.42.117); he\nwas understood, probably rightly, as meaning that in fact Demeter is\nnothing but corn, Dionysus nothing but wine, and so on. Most commentators agree that Prodicus was an atheist of some kind (for a dissenting view see Sedley 2013, at 329\u2013331), but there is some division of opinion on whether the atheism which he espoused was radical atheism, i.e. denial of the  existence of divine beings of any kind, or a more moderate version which denied the existence of the gods of popular and poetic tradition while allowing the divinity of cosmic items such as the heavenly bodies, water etc. (on the issue see Mayhew 2011, xvii, 183\u20134).  (For more recent discussions of Prodicus\u2019 views on religion, and of their connection with his views on cosmology and language see Kouloumentas 2018, Lebedev 2019 and Vassallo 2018.)\n    Atheism is more overt in the account of the origin of religion in a passage from a play\ncalled Sisyphus (DK 88B25), quoted by Sextus (Against the Mathematicians\nIX.54), attributed by DK and others on the authority of Sextus to the\nAthenian poet and oligarchic politician Critias, but now more usually\nthought to be by Euripides. The speaker (apparently Sisyphus himself)\nbegins with the picture of primitive human origins familiar from\nProtagoras\u2019 Great Speech: at first human life was bestial,\nunregulated by law, so humans invented laws to restrain mutual\naggression. But since legal sanctions were effective only when the\ncrime was discovered, someone \u2018stalwart and wise in his\nmind\u2019 invented the fiction that there are gods who live in the\nheavens, who see everything and punish evil-doing, even when it is\nsecret. Atheism is explicit; the stalwart and wise man \u2018concealed\nthe truth with a false account\u2019 (line 26). Of course atheism\nexpressed by a character in a play cannot be directly attributed to the\nauthor, whoever he was; this is merely one of the expressions in\nfifth-century drama of a wide range of attitudes to religion, ranging\nfrom outright atheism (e.g., Euripides Fragments 7, 286, \u2018Does then anyone say\nthere are gods in heaven? There are not, there are not, if a man is\nwilling not to give foolish credence to the ancient story\u2019) to\npious declaration of faith (Euripides Fragments 8, 912b, \u2018See, all you who think\nthe gods do not exist, how you are doubly in error with your poor\njudgment. They exist indeed, they exist\u2019). The significance of the\nSisyphus fragment is rather as further evidence of the fact\nthat in the late fifth century the rationalistic approach to the\nnatural world, including human nature, provided the intellectual\nfoundation of a range of views hostile to traditional religion,\nincluding explicit atheism. From Protagoras himself we have a\nfirst-person declaration, not of atheism, but of agnosticism, in what\nwas apparently the opening of his work On the Gods:\n\u2018Concerning the gods I am not able to know either that they exist\nor that they do not exist or what their nature is; for there are many\nthings which prevent one from knowing, both the unclarity (sc. of the\nsubject) and the short span of human life\u2019 (DK 80B4). According\nto some sources the outrage occasioned by this work led to his books\nbeing publicly burned and his being forced to flee from Athens to\nescape prosecution, and he is said by some to have drowned while trying\nto escape by sea (DK 80A1\u20134, 12). That story suggests that he was seen\nas a threat to traditional religion, much as Anaxagoras (and later\nSocrates) was, but the evidence of Plato\u2019s Meno 91e (see\nabove) gives an altogether different picture, since in that\npassage Socrates describes him as having had an unblemished reputation\nduring forty years of activity as a sophist, a reputation, moreover,\nwhich has lasted from his death till the present day, i.e., till the\ndramatic date of the dialogue in the last few years of the century.\nProtagoras\u2019 avowed agnosticism did not, then, provoke public\noutrage or even bring him into ill-repute, and it is worth considering\nwhy not. The answer may lie in his social relativism on matters of\nmorality (see above); it is probable that among the things which\n\u2018seem right and fine for each city\u2019 and which therefore\n\u2018are so for that city so long as it maintains them\u2019\n(Theaetetus 167c) are the prescriptions that it is right to honour\nthe gods by the traditional observances. (The verb nomizein,\nhere translated \u2018maintain\u2019, is regularly used to apply,\namong other things, both to religious belief and to ritual practice:\nthe wording of the accusation against Socrates, that \u2018he does not\nnomizei the gods whom the city nomizei\u2019 implies\nthat he neither believes in nor worships the gods of the city.) It is\nprobable, then, that Protagoras was supportive of traditional religious\npractice, while the wording of his proclamation of agnosticism does not\neven offer a direct challenge to conventional belief. He cannot know\nwhether or not the gods exist or what they are like; this presumably\n(though in the light of Protagorean subjectivism the inference is not\nas secure as it would otherwise be) implies that no-one can know these\nthings, but lack of knowledge is no bar to belief, particularly if that\nbelief is socially useful, as Protagoras probably thought it was.\nOverall, it is likely that Protagoras\u2019 position on religious\nbelief and practice was as conservative as his general social and moral\nviews. If Xenophon\u2019s portrayal of Hippias\u2019 moral stance\n(see above) is historically accurate, then he held a deeply traditional\nview of the gods as authors of the unwritten law.\n",
