Say there are some alternatives to choose among. They\ncould be policies, public projects, candidates in an election,\ndistributions of income and labour requirements among the members of a\nsociety, or just about anything else. There are some people whose\npreferences will inform this choice, and the question is: which\nprocedures are there for deriving, from what is known or can be found\nout about their preferences, a collective or \u201csocial\u201d\nordering of the alternatives from better to worse? The answer is\nstartling. Arrow\u2019s theorem says there are no such procedures\nwhatsoever\u2014none, anyway, that satisfy certain apparently quite\nreasonable assumptions concerning the autonomy of the people and the\nrationality of their preferences. The technical framework in which\nArrow gave the question of social orderings a precise sense and its\nrigorous answer is now widely used for studying problems in welfare\neconomics. The impossibility theorem itself set much of the agenda for\ncontemporary social choice theory. Arrow accomplished this while still\na graduate student. In 1972, he received the Nobel Prize in economics\nfor his contributions.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Will of the People?\nSome of the trouble with social orderings is visible in a simple\nbut important example. Say there are three\nalternatives \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) to choose\namong. There is a group of three people 1, 2 and 3 whose preferences\nare to inform this choice, and they are asked to rank the alternatives\nby their own lights from better to worse. Their individual preference\norderings turn out to be:\n\nABC\nBCA\nCAB\n\nThat is, person 1 prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B\\),\nprefers \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and prefers \\(A\\)\nto \\(C\\); person 2 prefers \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), and so\non. Now, we might hope somehow to arrive at a single\n\u201csocial\u201d ordering of the alternatives that reflects the\npreferences of all three. Then we could choose whichever alternative\nis, socially, best\u2014or, if there is a tie for first place, we\ncould choose some alternative that is as good as any other. Suppose,\ntaking the alternatives pair by pair, we put the matter to a vote: we\ncount one alternative as socially preferred to another if\nthere are more voters who prefer it than there are who prefer the\nother one. We determine in this way that \\(A\\) is socially\npreferred to \\(B\\), since two voters (1 and 3) prefer \\(A\\)\nto \\(B\\), but only one (voter 2) prefers \\(B\\)\nto \\(A\\). Similarly, there is a social preference for \\(B\\)\nto \\(C\\). We might therefore expect to find that \\(A\\) is\nsocially preferred to \\(C\\). By this reckoning, though, it is\njust the other way around, since there are two voters who\nprefer \\(C\\) to \\(A\\). We do not have a\nsocial ordering of the alternatives at all. We have\na cycle. Starting from any alternative, moving to a socially\npreferred one, and from there to the next, you soon find\nyourself back where you \nstarted.[1]\nThis is the \u201cparadox of voting\u201d. Discovered by the\nMarquis de Condorcet (1785), it shows that possibilities for\nchoosing rationally can be lost when individual preferences are\naggregated into social preferences. Voter 1 has \\(A\\) at the top\nof his individual ordering. This voter\u2019s preferences can\nbe maximized, by choosing \\(A\\). The preferences of 2 or\n3 can also be maximized, by choosing instead their maxima, \\(B\\)\nor \\(C\\). Pairwise majority decision doesn\u2019t result in a social\nmaximum, though. \\(A\\) isn\u2019t one because a majority prefers\nsomething else, \\(C\\).  Likewise, \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are\nnot social maxima. The individual preferences lend themselves to\nmaximization; but, because they cycle, the social preferences do\nnot.\nAre there other aggregation procedures that are better than\npairwise majority decision, or do the different ones have shortcomings\nof their own? Condorcet, his contemporary Jean Charles de Borda\n(1781), and later Charles Dodgson (1844) and Duncan Black (1948),\namong others, all addressed this question by studying various\nprocedures and comparing their properties. Arrow broke new ground by\ncoming at it from the opposite direction. Starting with various\nrequirements that aggregation procedures might be expected to meet, he\nasked which procedures fill the bill. Among his requirements\nis Social Ordering, which insists that the result of\naggregation is always an ordering of the alternatives, never a\ncycle. After the introduction in\n Section 2 of\nthe technical framework that Arrow set up in order to study social\nchoice,\n Section 3.1 sets out further conditions\nthat he imposed. Briefly, these are: Unrestricted Domain\nwhich says that aggregation procedures must be able to handle any\nindividual preferences at all; Weak Pareto, which requires\nthem to respect unanimous individual\npreferences; Non-Dictatorship, which rules out procedures by\nwhich social preferences always agree with the strict preferences of\nsome one individual; and finally Independence of Irrelevant\nAlternatives, which says that the social comparison among any two\ngiven alternatives is to depend on individual preferences among only\nthat pair. Arrow\u2019s theorem, stated in\n Section 3.2, tells us that, except in\n the very simplest of cases, no\naggregation procedure whatsoever meets all the requirements.\nThe tenor of Arrow\u2019s theorem is deeply antithetical to the\npolitical ideals of the Enlightenment. It turns out that Condorcet\u2019s\nparadox is indeed not an isolated anomaly, the failure of one specific\nvoting method. Rather, it manifests a much wider problem with the very\nidea of collecting many individual preferences into one. On the face\nof it, anyway, there simply cannot be a common will of all the people\nconcerning collective decisions, that assimilates the tastes and\nvalues of all the individual men and women who make up a society.\nThere are some who, following Riker (1982), take Arrow\u2019s theorem to\nshow that democracy, conceived as government by the will of the\npeople, is an incoherent illusion. Others argue that some conditions\nof the theorem are unreasonable, and from their point of view the\nprospects for collective choice look much brighter. After presenting\nthe theorem itself, this entry will take up some main points of\ncritical discussion. Section 4 considers the\nmeaning and scope of Arrow\u2019s conditions. Section 5\ndiscusses aggregation procedures that are available when not all of\nArrows conditions need be satisfied, or when different underlying\nassumptions are made about the nature of social\nchoice. Section 6 concludes with an overview of\nproposals to study within Arrow\u2019s technical framework certain\naggregation problems other than the one that concerned him. \nAmartya Sen once expressed regret that the theory of social choice\ndoes not share with poetry the amiable characteristic of communicating\nbefore it is understood (Sen 1986). Arrow\u2019s theorem is not especially\ndifficult to understand and much about it is readily communicated, if\nnot in poetry, then at least in plain English.  Informal presentations\ngo only so far, though, and where they stop sometimes\nmisunderstandings start. This exposition uses a minimum of technical\nlanguage for the sake of clarity.\n2.  Arrow\u2019s Framework\nThe problem of finding an aggregation procedure arises, as Arrow\nframed it, in connection with some given alternatives between which\nthere is a choice is to be made. The nature of these alternatives\ndepends on the kind of choice problem that is being studied. In the\ntheory of elections, the alternatives are people who might stand as\ncandidates in an election. In welfare economics they are different\nstates of a society, such as distributions of income and labour\nrequirements. The alternatives conventionally are referred to using\nlower case letters from the end of the alphabet\nas \\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\); the set of all\nthese alternatives is \\(X\\). The people whose tastes and values\nwill inform the choice are assumed to be finite in number, and they\nare enumerated \\(1, \\ldots, n\\).\nArrow\u2019s problem arises, then, only after some alternatives\nand people have been fixed. It is for them that an aggregation\nprocedure is sought. Crucially, though, this problem\narises before relevant information about the people\u2019s\npreferences among the alternatives has been gathered, whether that is\nby polling or some other method for eliciting or determining\npreferences. The question that Arrow\u2019s theorem answers is, more\nprecisely, this: Which procedures are there for arriving at a social\nordering of some given alternatives, on the basis of some given\npeople\u2019s preferences among them, no matter what these preferences turn\nout to be?\nIn practice, meanwhile, we sometimes must select a procedure for\nmaking social decisions without knowing for which alternatives and\npeople it will be used. In recurring elections for some public office,\nfor instance, there is a different slate of candidates each time, and\na different population of voters, and we must use the same voting\nmethod to determine the winner, no matter who the candidates and\nvoters are and no matter how many of them there happen to be. Such\nprocedures are not directly available for study within Arrow\u2019s\nframework, with its fixed set \\(X\\) of alternatives and people\n\\(1, \\ldots, n\\). Arrow\u2019s theorem is still relevant to them,\nthough. It tells us that even when the alternatives and\npeople are held fixed, then still there is no \u201cgood\u201d\nmethod for deriving social orderings. Now, if there is no good method\nfor voting even once, with the particular candidates and voters who\nare involved on that occasion, then nor, presumably, is there a good\nmethod that can be used repeatedly, with different candidates and\nvoters each time.\n2.1 Individual Preferences\nArrow assumed that social orderings will be derived, if at all,\nfrom information about people\u2019s preferences. This information is, in\nhis framework, merely ordinal. It is the kind of information\nthat is implicated in Condorcet\u2019s paradox of voting,\nin Section 1, where each person ranks the\nalternatives from better to worse but there is nothing beyond this\nabout how strong anybody\u2019s preferences are, or about how the\npreferences of one person compare in strength to those of another. In\nconfining aggregation procedures to ordinal information, Arrow argued\nthat:\n\n [I]t seems to make no sense to add the utility of\none individual, a psychic magnitude in his mind, with the utility of\nanother individual. (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 11)\n\n His point was that even if people do have\nstronger and weaker preferences, and even if the strengths of their\npreferences can somehow be measured and made available as a basis for\nsocial decisions, nevertheless ordinal information is all that\nmatters because preferences are \u201cinterpersonally\nincomparable\u201d. Intuitively, what this means is that there is no\nsaying how much more strongly someone must prefer one thing to\nanother in order to make up for the fact that someone else\u2019s\npreference is just the other way around. Arrow saw no reason to\nprovide aggregation procedures with information about the strength of preferences\nbecause he thought that they cannot put such information to\nmeaningful use. \nAccordingly, the preferences of individual people are represented\nin Arrow\u2019s framework by binary relations \\(R_{i}\\) among the\nalternatives: \\(xR_{i}y\\) means that individual \\(i\\) weakly\nprefers alternative \\(x\\) to alternative \\(y\\). That is, either\n\\(i\\) strictly prefers \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), or else \\(i\\)\nis indifferent between them, finding them equally good. Each\nindividual preference relation \\(R_{i}\\) is assumed to\nbe connected (for all alternatives \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), either\n\\(xR_{i}y\\), or \\(yR_{i}x\\), or both) and transitive (for all\n\\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\), if \\(xR_{i}y\\) and \\(yR_{i}z\\), then\n\\(xR_{i}z\\)). That these relations have these structural properties\nwas, for Arrow, a matter of the \u201crationality\u201d of the\npreferences they represent; for further discussion, see the entries on\nPreferences and Philosophy of Economics. Connected, transitive\nrelations are called weak orderings. They are\n\u201cweak\u201d in that they allow ties\u2014in this connection,\nindifference.\n\nA preference profile is a list \\(\\langle R_{1}, \\ldots,\nR_{n}\\rangle\\) of weak orderings of the set \\(X\\) of alternatives, one\nfor each of the people \\(1, \\ldots, n\\). The list of three\nindividual orderings in the paradox of voting is an example of a\npreference profile for the alternatives \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) and people\n1, 2, and 3. A profile is a representation of the individual\npreferences of everybody who will be consulted in the choice among the\nalternatives. It is in the form of profiles that Arrow\u2019s aggregation\nprocedures receive information about individual preferences. Often it\nis convenient to write \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) instead of \\(\\langle\nR_{1}, \\ldots, R_{n}\\rangle\\). Other profiles are written \\(\\langle\nR^*_{i}\\rangle\\), and so on.\nIn restricting individual inputs to weak orderings of the\nalternatives, Arrow overlooked the possibility that people could input\ninformation about their preferences in the form of ordinal scores or\ngrades. Graded inputs enable an \u201cescape\u201d from Arrow\u2019s\nimpossibility that is explained in Section\n5.3. Amartya Sen extended Arrow\u2019s framework to take into account\nnot only ordinal information about people\u2019s preferences among pairs of\nalternatives, but also cardinal information about the utility\nthey derive from each one. In this way he was able to investigate the\nconsequences of other assumptions than Arrow\u2019s about the measurability\nand interpersonal comparability of individual\npreferences. See Section 5.4 and the\nentry social choice theory for details\nand references.\n2.2 Multiple Profiles\nArrow required aggregation procedures to derive social orderings\nfrom more than just a single profile, representing\neveryone\u2019s actual preferences. In his framework they must\nreckon with many profiles, representing preferences that the\npeople could have.\nVariety among preferences is the result, in Arrow\u2019s account, of the\ndifferent standards by which we assess our options. Our preferences\ndepend on our \u201ctastes\u201d in personal consumption but\nimportantly, for social choice, they also depend on our socially\ndirected \u201cvalues\u201d. Now, we are to some extent free to have\nvarious tastes, values, and preferences; and we are free, also, to\nhave these independently of one another. Any individual can have a\nrange of preferences, then, and for any given sets of people and\nalternatives there are many possible preference profiles. One profile\n\\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) represents the preferences of these people\namong their alternatives in, if you will, one possible world.  Another\nprofile \\(\\langle\nR^*_{i}\\rangle\\) represents preferences of the same\npeople, and among the same alternatives, but in another possible world\nwhere their tastes and values are different.\nArrow\u2019s rationale for requiring aggregation procedures to handle\nmany profiles was epistemic. As he framed the question of collective\nchoice, a procedure is sought for deriving a social ordering of some\ngiven alternatives on the basis of some given people\u2019s tastes and\nvalues. It is sought, though, before it is known just what these\ntastes and values happen to be. The variety among profiles to be\nreckoned with is a measure, in Arrow\u2019s account of the matter, of how\nmuch is known or assumed about everybody\u2019s preferences a\npriori, which is to say before these have been elicited. When\nless is known, there are more profiles from which a social ordering\nmight have to be derived. When more is known, there are fewer of\nthem.\nThere are other reasons for working with many profiles, even when\npeople\u2019s actual preferences are known fully in advance. Serge Kolm (1996)\nsuggested that counterfactual preferences are relevant when we\ncome to justify the use of some given procedure.\nSensitivity analysis, used to manage uncertainty about errors in the\ninput, and to determine which information is critical in the sense\nthat the output turns on it, also requires that procedures handle a\nrange of inputs.\nWith many profiles in play there can be \u201cinterprofile\u201d\nconditions on aggregation procedures. These coordinate the results of\naggregation at several profiles at once. One such condition that plays\na crucial role in Arrow\u2019s theorem is Independence of Irrelevant\nAlternatives. It requires that whenever everybody\u2019s preferences\namong two alternatives are in one profile the same as in another, the\ncollective ordering must also be the same at the two profiles, as far\nas these alternatives are concerned. There is to be this much\nsimilarity among social orderings even as people\u2019s tastes and values\nchange. Sections 3.1\nand 4.5 discuss in more detail the meaning of\nthis controversial requirement, and the extent to which it is\nreasonable to impose it on aggregation procedures.\nIan Little raised the following objection in an early discussion\nof (Arrow 1951):\n\nIf tastes change, we may expect a new ordering of all the\nconceivable states; but we do not require that the difference between\nthe new and the old ordering should bear any particular relation to\nthe changes of taste which have occurred. We have, so to speak, a new\nworld and a new order; and we do not demand correspondence between the\nchange in the world and the change in the order (Little 1952:\n423\u2013424).\n\nLittle apparently agreed with Arrow that there might be a different\nsocial ordering were people\u2019s tastes different, but unlike Arrow he\nthought that it wouldn\u2019t have to be similar to the actual or current\nordering in any special way. Little\u2019s objection was taken to support\nthe \u201csingle profile\u201d approach to social welfare judgments\nof Abram Bergson (1938) and Paul Samuelson (1947), and there was a\ndebate about which approach was best, theirs or Arrow\u2019s.  Arguably,\nwhat was at issue in this debate was not\u2014or should not have\nbeen\u2014whether aggregation procedures must handle more than a\nsingle preference profile, but instead whether there should be any\ncoordination of the output at different profiles. Among others Sen\n(1977) and Fleurbaey and Mongin (2005) have made this point. If they\nare right then the substance of Little\u2019s objection can be accommodated\nwithin Arrow\u2019s multi-profile framework simply by not imposing any\ninterprofile constraints. Be this as it may, Arrow\u2019s framework is\nnowadays the dominant one. \n2.3 Social Welfare Functions\nSometimes a certain amount is known about everybody\u2019s preferences\nbefore these have been elicited. Profiles that are compatible with\nwhat is known represent preferences that the people could have, and\nmight turn out actually to have, and it is from these\n\u201cadmissible\u201d profiles that we may hope to derive social\norderings. Technically, a domain, in Arrow\u2019s framework, is a\nset of admissible profiles, each concerning the same alternatives \\(X\\)\nand people \\(1, \\ldots, n\\). A social welfare function \\(f\\)\nassigns to each profile \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) in some domain a binary\nrelation \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) on \\(X\\). Intuitively, \\(f\\) is an\naggregation procedure and \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) represents the\nsocial preferences that it derives from \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\).\nArrow\u2019s social welfare functions are sometimes called\n\u201cconstitutions\u201d.\nArrow incorporated into the notion of a social welfare function the\nfurther requirement that \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) is always a weak\nordering of the set \\(X\\) of alternatives.  Informally speaking, this\nmeans that the output of the social welfare function must always be a\nranking of the alternatives from better to worse, perhaps with\nties. It may never be a cycle. This requirement will appear here, as\nit does in other contemporary presentations of Arrow\u2019s theorem, as a\nseparate condition of Social Ordering that social welfare\nfunctions might be required to meet.  See\n Section 3.1. This way, we can consider the\n consequences of dropping this\ncondition without changing any basic parts of the framework.\nSee Section 4.2.\nArrow established a convention that is still widely observed of\nusing \u2018\\(R\\)\u2019 to denote the social preference derived from\n\u201c\\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\)\u201d. The social welfare function used to derive it\nis, in his notation, left implicit. One advantage of writing\n\u2018\\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\)\u2019 instead of \u2018\\(R\\)\u2019 is\nthat when we state the conditions of the impossibility theorem, in the\nnext section, the social welfare function will figure explicitly in\nthem. This makes it quite clear that what these conditions constrain\nis the functional relationship between individual and social\npreferences. Focusing attention on this was an important innovation of\nArrow\u2019s approach.\n3. Impossibility\nWith the conceptual framework now in\nplace, Section 3.1 sets out the\n\u201cconditions\u201d or constraints that Arrow imposed on social\nwelfare functions, and Section 3.2 states the\ntheorem itself.  Section 4 explains the\nconditions more fully, discusses reasons that Arrow gave for imposing\nthem, and considers whether it is proper to do so. \nArrow\u2019s conditions often are called axioms, and his approach is\nsaid to be axiomatic. This might be found misleading. Unlike axioms of\nlogic or geometry, Arrow\u2019s conditions are not supposed to express more\nor less indubitable truths, or to constitute an implicit definition of\nthe object of study. Arrow himself took them to be questionable\n\u201cvalue judgments\u201d that \u201cexpress the doctrines of\ncitizens\u2019 sovereignty and rationality in a very general form\u201d\n(Arrow 1951 [1963]: 31). Indeed, as we will see\nin Section 4, and as Arrow himself recognized,\nsometimes it is not even desirable that social welfare functions\nshould satisfy all conditions of the impossibility theorem.\nArrow restated the conditions in the second edition of Social\nChoice and Individual Values (Arrow 1963). They appear here in\nthe canonical form into which they have settled since then.\n3.1 These Conditions\u2026\nA first requirement is that the social welfare function \\(f\\) can\nhandle any combination of any individual preferences at all:\n\nUnrestricted Domain (U): The domain of \\(f\\)\nincludes every list \\(\\langle R_{1}, \\ldots, R_{n}\\rangle\\) of \\(n\\)\nweak orderings of \\(X\\).\n\nCondition U requires that \\(f\\) is defined for each\n\u201clogically possible\u201d profile of individual preferences. A\nsecond requirement is that, in each case, \\(f\\) produces an ordering of\nthe alternatives, perhaps with ties:\n\nSocial Ordering (SO): For any profile \\(\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle\\) in the domain, \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) is a weak\nordering of \\(X\\).\n\nNotice that, as the paradox of voting in\n Section 1 shows, these two conditions\n U and SO by\nthemselves already rule out aggregating preferences by pairwise\nmajority decision, if there are at least three alternatives to choose\nbetween, and three people whose preferences are to be taken into\naccount.\nTo state the next requirements it is convenient to use some\nshorthand. For any given individual ordering \\(R_{i}\\), let \\(P_{i}\\) be\nthe strict or asymmetrical part of \\(R_{i}: xP_{i}y\\)\nif \\(xR_{i}y\\) but not \\(yR_{i}x\\). Intuitively, \\(xP_{i}y\\) means\nthat \\(i\\) really does prefer \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), in that \\(i\\) is not indifferent\nbetween them. Similarly, let \\(P\\) be the strict part of \\(f\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle\\). The next condition of Arrow\u2019s theorem is: \n\nWeak Pareto (WP): For any profile \\(\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle\\) in the domain of \\(f\\), and any alternatives \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\), if for all \\(i\\), \\(xP_{i}y\\),\nthen \\(xPy\\). \n\nWP requires \\(f\\) to respect unanimous strict\npreferences. That is, whenever everyone strictly prefers one\nalternative to another, the social ordering that \\(f\\) derives must\nagree. Pairwise majority decision\nsatisfies \nWP.[2]\n Many other well-known voting methods such\nas Borda counting satisfy it as well (see\n Section 5.2). So WP requires\n that \\(f\\) is to this extent like\nthem.\nThe next condition ensures that social preferences are not based\nentirely on the preferences of any one person. Person \\(d\\) is\na dictator of \\(f\\) if for any alternatives \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and\nfor any profile \\(\\langle\\ldots, R_{d},\\ldots\\rangle\\) in the domain of\n\\(f\\): if \\(xP_{d}y\\), then \\(xPy\\). When a dictator strictly prefers one\nthing to another, the society always does as well. Other people\u2019s\npreferences can still influence social preferences. So can\n\u201cnon-welfare\u201d features of the alternatives such as, in\nthe case of social states, the extent to which people are equal,\ntheir rights are respected, and so on. But all these can make a\ndifference only when the dictator is indifferent between two\nalternatives, having no strict preference one way or the other. The\ncondition is now simply:\n\nNondictatorship (D): \\(f\\) has no dictator.\n\nTo illustrate, pick some person \\(d\\), any one at all, and from each\nprofile \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) in the domain take the ordering \\(R_{d}\\)\nrepresenting the preferences of \\(d\\). Now, in each case, let the social\npreference be that. In other words, for each profile \\(\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle\\), let \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) be \\(R_{d}\\).  This social\nwelfare function \\(f\\) bases the social ordering entirely on the\npreferences of \\(d\\), its dictator. It is intuitively undemocratic\nand D rules it out.\nTo state the last condition of Arrow\u2019s theorem, another piece of\nshorthand is handy. For any given relation \\(R\\), and any set \\(S\\), let\n\\(R|S\\) be the restriction of \\(R\\) to \\(S\\). It is that part of \\(R\\)\nconcerning just the elements of \n\\(S\\).[3]\n The restriction of \\(\\langle\nR_{1}, \\ldots, R_{n}\\rangle\\) to \\(S\\), written \\(\\langle\nR_{1}, \\ldots, R_{n}\\rangle|S\\), is just \\(\\langle R_{1}|S,\n\\ldots, R_{n}|S\\rangle\\). Take for instance the profile from the\nparadox of voting in Section 1:\n\n ABC\n BCA\n CAB\n\nIts restriction to the set \\(\\{A,C\\}\\) of alternatives is:\n\nAC\nCA\nCA\n\nNow the remaining condition can be stated: \n\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives (I): For\nall alternatives \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(X\\), and all profiles \\(\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle R^*_{i}\\rangle\\) in the domain of \\(f\\), if\n\\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle|\\{x,y\\} = \\langle R^*_{i}\\rangle|\\{x,y\\}\\), then\n\\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle |\\{x,y\\} = f\\langle R^*_{i}\\rangle\n|\\{x,y\\}\\).\n\nI says that whenever two profiles \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\)\nand \\(\\langle R^*_{i}\\rangle\\) are identical, as far as some\nalternatives \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are concerned, so too must the social\npreference relations \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) and \\(f\\langle\nR^*_{i}\\rangle\\) be identical, as far as \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are concerned. For\nexample, consider the profile:\n\nBAC\nCAB\nBCA\n\nIts restriction to the pair {\\(A\\),\\(C\\)} is identical to that of the\nprofile of the paradox of voting. Suppose the domain of a social\nwelfare function includes both of these profiles. Then, to\nsatisfy I, it must derive from each one the same social\npreference among \\(A\\) and \\(C\\). The social preference among \\(A\\) and \\(C\\)\nis, in this sense, to be \u201cindependent\u201d of anybody\u2019s\npreferences among either of them and the remaining\n\u201cirrelevant\u201d alternative \\(B\\). The same is to hold for any\ntwo profiles in the domain, and for any other pair taken from the set\n\\(X\\) = {\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\)} of all alternatives. Some voting methods do not\nsatisfy I (see Section 5.2), but\npairwise majority decision does. To see whether \\(x\\) is socially\npreferred to \\(y\\), by this method, you need look no further than the\nindividual preferences among \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \n3.2 \u2026are Incompatible\nArrow discovered that, except in the very simplest of cases, the\nfive conditions of Section 3.1 are\nincompatible.\n\nArrow\u2019s Theorem: Suppose there are more than two\nalternatives. Then no social welfare function \\(f\\)\nsatisfies U, SO, WP, D,\nand I.\n\nArrow (1951) has the original proof of this\n\u201cimpossibility\u201d theorem. See among many other works Kelly\n1978, Campbell and Kelly 2002, Geanakoplos 2005 and Gaertner 2009 for\nvariants and different proofs.\n4. The Conditions, again\nTaken separately, the conditions of Arrow\u2019s theorem do not seem\nsevere. Apparently, they ask of an aggregation procedure only that it\nwill come up with a social preference ordering no matter what\neverybody prefers (U and SO), that it will resemble\ncertain democratic arrangements in some ways (WP\nand I), and that it will not resemble certain undemocratic\narrangements in another way (D). Taken together, though,\nthese conditions exclude all possibility of deriving social\npreferences. It is time to consider them more closely. \n4.1 Unrestricted Domain\nArrow\u2019s domain condition U says that the domain of the\nsocial welfare function includes every list of \\(n\\) weak orderings of\n\\(X\\). For example, suppose the alternatives are \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), and\nthat the people are 1, 2, and 3. There are 13 weak orderings of three\nalternatives, so the unrestricted domain contains 2197 (that is,\n\\(13^{3}\\)) lists of weak orderings of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). A social\nwelfare function \\(f\\) for these alternatives and people, if it\nsatisfies U, maps each one of these \u201clogically\npossible\u201d preference profiles onto a collective preference among\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\).\nIn Arrow\u2019s account, the different profiles in a domain represent\npreferences that the people might turn out to have. To\nimpose U, on his epistemic rationale, amounts to assuming\nthat they might have any preferences at all: it is only when their\npreferences could be anything that it makes sense to require the\nsocial welfare function to be ready for everything. Arrow wrote in\nsupport of U:\n\n If we do not wish to require any prior knowledge\nof the tastes of individuals before specifying our social welfare\nfunction, that function will have to be defined for every logically\npossible set of individual orderings. (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 24)\n\nThere have been misunderstandings. Some think U requires\nof social welfare functions that they can handle \u201cany old\u201d\nalternatives. It does nothing of the sort. What it requires is that the\nsocial welfare function can handle the widest possible range\nof preferences among whichever alternatives there are to\nchoose among, and whether there happen to be many of these or only a\nfew of them is beside the point: the domain of a social welfare\nfunction can be completely unrestricted even if there are in \\(X\\) just\ntwo alternatives. One way to sustain this unorthodox understanding\nof U is, perhaps, to think of Arrow\u2019s \\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\) not as alternatives properly\nspeaking\u2014not as candidates in elections, social states, or what\nhave you\u2014but as names or labels that represent these on\ndifferent occasions for choosing. Then, it might be thought, variety\namong the alternatives to which the labels can be attached will generate\nvariety among the profiles that an aggregation procedure might be\nexpected to handle.  Blackorby et al. (2006) toy with this idea at one\npoint, but they quickly set it aside. It does not seem to have been\nexplored in the literature.\nOf course, there is nothing to keep anyone from reinterpreting\nArrow\u2019s basic notions, including the set \\(X\\) of alternatives, in any\nway they like; a theorem is a theorem no matter what interpretation\nit is given. It is important to realize, though, that to interpret\n\\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\) as labels is not standard, and can\nonly make nonsense of much of the theory of social choice to which\nArrow\u2019s theorem has given \nrise.[4]\nArrow already knew that U is a stronger domain condition\nthan is needed for an impossibility result. The free triple\nproperty and the chain property are weaker conditions\nthat replace U in some versions of Arrow\u2019s theorem (Campbell\nand Kelly 2002). These versions, being more informative, are, from a\nlogical point of view, better. U is simpler to state than\ntheir domain conditions, though, and might be found more\nintuitive. Notice that the weaker domain conditions still require a\nlot of variety among profiles. A typical proof of an Arrow-style\nimpossibility theorem requires that the domain is unrestricted with\nrespect to some three alternatives. In this case there is always a\npreference profile like the one implicated in the paradox of voting\nin Section 1, from which pairwise majority\ndecision derives a cycle.\nWhether it is sensible to impose U or any other domain\ncondition on a social welfare function depends very much on the\nparticulars of the choice problem being studied. Sometimes, in the\nnature of the alternatives under consideration, and the way in which\nindividual preferences among them are determined, imposing U\ncertainly is not appropriate. If for instance the alternatives are\ndifferent ways of dividing up a pie among some people, and it is known\nprior to selecting a social welfare function that these people are\nselfish, each caring only about the size of his own piece, then it\nmakes no obvious sense to require of a suitable function that it can\nhandle cases in which some people prefer to have less for themselves\nthan to have more. The social welfare function will never be called on\nto handle such cases for the simple reason that they will never arise.\nArrow made this point as follows:\n\n[I]t has frequently been assumed or implied in welfare economics\nthat each individual values different social states solely according\nto his consumption under them. If this be the case, we should only\nrequire that our social welfare function be defined for those sets of\nindividual orderings which are of the type described; only such should\nbe admissible (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 24).\n\nSection 5.1 considers some of the\npossibilities that open up when there is no need to reckon with all\n\u201clogically possible\u201d individual preferences.\n4.2 Social Ordering\nCondition SO requires that the result of aggregating\nindividual preferences is always a weak ordering of the alternatives,\na binary relation among them that is both transitive and connected.\nIntuitively, the result has to be a ranking of the\nalternatives from better to worse, perhaps with ties. There is never\nto be a cycle of social preferences, like the one derived by pairwise\nmajority decision in the paradox of voting,\nin Section 1.\nArrow did not state SO as a separate\ncondition. He built it into the very notion of a social\nwelfare function, arguing that the result of aggregating\npreferences will have to be an ordering if it is to \u201creflect\nrational choice-making\u201d (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 19). Criticized by\nBuchanan (1954) for transferring properties of individual\nchoice to collective choice, Arrow in the second edition of Social\nChoice and Individual Values gave a different rationale. There he\nargued that transitivity is important because it ensures that\ncollective choices are independent of the path taken to them (Arrow\n1951 [1963]: 120). He did not develop this idea further.\nCharles Plott (1973) elaborated a suitable notion of path\nindependence. Suppose we arrive at our choice by what he\ncalled divide and conquer: first we divide the alternatives\ninto some smaller sets\u2014say, because these are more\nmanageable\u2014and we choose from each one. Then we gather together\nall the alternatives that we have chosen from the smaller sets, and we\nchoose again from among these. There are many ways of making the\ninitial division, and a choice procedure is said to be path\nindependent if the choice we arrive at in the end is independent\nof which division we start with (Plott 1973: 1080). In Arrow\u2019s\naccount, social choices are made from some given\n\u201cenvironment\u201d \\(S\\) of feasible alternatives by maximizing a\nsocial ordering \\(R\\): the choice \\(C(S)\\) from among \\(S\\) is the set of\nthose \\(x\\) within \\(S\\) such that for any \\(y\\) within \\(S, xRy\\).  It is not\ndifficult to see how intransitivity of \\(R\\) can result in path\ndependence. Consider again the paradox of voting\nof Section 1.  \\(A\\) is strictly favoured above\n\\(B\\), and \\(B\\) above \\(C\\); but, contrary to transitivity, \\(C\\) is strictly\nfavoured above \\(A\\). Starting with the division \\(\\{\\{A,B\\}, \\{B,C\\}\\}\\),\nour choice from among \\(\\{A,B,C\\}\\) will be \\(\\{A\\}\\); but starting\ninstead with \\(\\{\\{A,C\\}, \\{B,C\\}\\}\\) we will arrive in the end at\n\\(\\{B\\}\\).\nPlott\u2019s analysis reveals a subtlety. The full strength\nof SO is not needed to secure path independence of\nchoice. It is sufficient that social preference is a (complete\nand) quasi-transitive relation, having a strict component\nthat is transitive but an indifference component that, perhaps, is\nnot transitive. Sen (1969: Theorem V) demonstrated the compatibility\nof this weaker requirement with all of Arrow\u2019s other conditions, but\nnoted that the aggregation function he came up with would not\ngenerally be found attractive. Its unattractiveness was no\naccident. Allan Gibbard showed that the only social welfare functions\nmade available by allowing intransitivity of social indifference,\nwhile keeping Arrow\u2019s other requirements in place, are what he\ncalled liberum veto oligarchies (Gibbard 1969, 2014). There\nhas in every case to be some group of individuals, the oligarchs,\nsuch that the society always strictly prefers one alternative to\nanother if all of the oligarchs strictly prefer it, but never does so\nif that would go against the strict preference of any\noligarch.[5] A\ndictatorship, in Arrow\u2019s sense, is a liberum veto oligarchy of\none. Relaxing SO by limiting the transitivity requirement to\nstrict social preferences therefore does not seem a promising way of\nsecuring, in spite of Arrow\u2019s theorem, the existence of acceptable\nsocial welfare functions.\n\n4.3 Weak Pareto\nCondition WP requires that whenever everybody ranks one\nalternative strictly above another the social ordering agrees. This\nhas long been a basic assumption in welfare economics and might seem\ncompletely uncontroversial. That the community should prefer one\nsocial state to another whenever each individual does, Arrow argued in\nconnection with compensation, is \u201cnot debatable except perhaps\non a philosophy of systematically denying people whatever they\nwant\u201d (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 34).\nBut WP is not as harmless as it might seem, and in\ncombination with U it tightly constrains the possibilities\nfor social choice. This is evident from Sen\u2019s (1970) demonstration\nthat these two conditions conflict with the idea that for each person\nthere is a personal domain of states of affairs, within which his\npreferences must prevail in case of conflict with others\u2019. This\nimportant problem of the \u201cParetian libertarian\u201d meanwhile\nhas its own extensive literature. For further discussion, see the\nentry social choice theory.\nWe may think of WP as a vestige of what Sen called:\n\nWelfarism: The judgement of the relative goodness of\nalternative states of affairs must be based exclusively on, and taken\nas an increasing function of, the respective collections of\nindividual utilities in these states (Sen 1979: 468).\n\nIn Arrow\u2019s ordinal framework, welfarism insists that individual\npreference orderings are the only basis for deriving social\npreferences. Non-welfare factors\u2014physical characteristics of\nsocial states, people\u2019s motives in having the preferences they do,\nrespect for rights, equality\u2014none of these are to make any\ndifference except indirectly, through their reflections in individual\npreferences. WP asserts the demands of welfarism in the\nspecial case in which everybody\u2019s strict preferences coincide. Sen\nargued that even these limited demands might be found excessive on\nmoral grounds (Sen 1979: Section IV). Section 4.5 \nhas further discussion of welfarism.\n\n\n4.4 Non-Dictatorship\nSomeone is a dictator, in Arrow\u2019s sense, if whenever he strictly\nprefers one alternative to another the society always prefers it as\nwell. The preferences of people other than the dictator can still make\na difference, and so can non-welfare factors, but only when the\ndictator is indifferent between two alternatives, having no strict\npreference one way or the other. Arrow\u2019s non-dictatorship\ncondition D says that there is to be no dictator. Plainly it\nrules out many undemocratic arrangements, such as identifying social\npreferences in every case with the individual preferences of some one\nperson. This apparently straightforward condition has attracted very\nlittle attention in the literature. \nIn fact there is more to the non-dictatorship condition than meets\nthe eye. An Arrovian dictator is just someone whose strict preferences\ninvariably are a subset of the society\u2019s strict preferences, and that\nby itself doesn\u2019t mean that his preferences form a basis for social\npreferences, or that the dictator has any power or control over\nthese. Aanund Hylland once made a related point while objecting to the\nunreflective imposition of D in single profile analyses of\nsocial choice:\n\nIn the single-profile model, a dictator is a\nperson whose individual preferences coincide with the social ones in\nthe one and only profile under consideration. Nothing is necessarily\nwrong with that; the decision process can be perfectly democratic, and\none person simply turns out to be on the winning side on all\nissues. (Hylland 1986: 51, footnote 10) \nThe non-dictatorship condition for this reason sometimes goes too\nfar. Even pairwise majority voting, that paradigm of a democratic\nprocedure, is in Arrow\u2019s sense sometimes a dictatorship. Consider\nZelig. He has no tastes, values or preferences of his own but\ntemporarily takes on those of another, whoever is close at hand. He is\na human chameleon, the ultimate\nconformist.[6]\nZelig one day finds himself on a committee of three that will choose\namong several options using the method of pairwise majority voting\nand, given his peculiar character, the range of individual orderings\nthat can arise is somewhat restricted. In each admissible profile, two\nof the three individual orderings are identical: Zelig\u2019s and that of\nwhoever is seated closest to him at the committee\nmeeting.[7] Now\nsuppose it so happens that Zelig strictly prefers one option \\(x\\) to\nanother, \\(y\\). Then someone else does too; that makes two of the\nthree and so, when they vote, the result is a strict collective\npreference for \\(x\\) above \\(y\\). The committee\u2019s decision procedure\nis, in Arrow\u2019s sense, a dictatorship, and Zelig is the dictator. But\nof course really Zelig is a follower, not a leader, and majority\nvoting is as democratic as can be. It\u2019s just that this one mad little\nfellow has a way of always ending up on the winning side.\nArrow imposed D in conjunction with the\nrequirement U that the domain is completely\nunrestricted. Perhaps this condition expresses something closer to its\nintended meaning then. With an unrestricted domain, a dictator, unlike\nZelig, is someone whose preferences conflict with everybody else\u2019s in\na range of cases, and it is in each instance his preferences that\nagree with social preferences, not theirs. However this may be, the\nexample of Zelig shows that whether it is appropriate to\nimpose D on social welfare functions depends on the details\nof the choice problem at hand.  The name of this condition is\nmisleading. Sometimes there is nothing undemocratic about having a\n\u201cdictator\u201d, in Arrow\u2019s technical sense.\n4.5 Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives\nArrow\u2019s independence condition requires that whenever all\nindividual preferences among a pair of alternatives are the same in\none profile as they are in another, the social preference among these\nalternatives must also be the same for the two profiles. Speaking\nfiguratively, what this means is that when the social welfare function\ngoes about the work of aggregating individual orderings, it has to\ntake each pair of alternatives separately, paying no attention to\npreferences for alternatives other than them. Some aggregation\nprocedures work this way. Pairwise majority decision does: it counts\n\\(x\\) as weakly preferred to \\(y\\), socially, if as many people weakly\nprefer \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) as the other way around, and plainly there is no\nneed to look beyond \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to find this out.\nCondition I is not Arrow\u2019s formulation. It is a simpler\none that has since become the standard in expositions of the\nimpossibility theorem. Arrow\u2019s formulation concerns choices made from\nwithin various \u201cenvironments\u201d \\(S\\) of feasible options by\nmaximizing social orderings:\n\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives (choice\nversion): For all environments \\(S\\) within \\(X\\), and all profiles\n\\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle R^*_{i}\\rangle\\) in the domain of\n\\(f\\), if \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle|S = \\langle R^*_{i}\\rangle|S\\), then\n\\(C(S)= C^*(S)\\).\n\nHere \\(C(S)\\) is the set of those options from \\(S\\) that are, in\nthe sense of the social ordering \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\), as good as\nany other; and \\(C^*(S)\\) stands for the maxima by \\(f\\langle\nR^*_{i}\\rangle\\). This is Arrow\u2019s Condition 3 (Arrow 1951 [1963]:\n27).[8] \nIain McLean (2003) finds a first statement\nof Independence, and appreciation of its significance,\nalready in (Condorcet 1785). Meanwhile much controversy has surrounded\nthis condition, and not a little confusion. Some of each can be traced\nto an example with which Arrow sought to\nmotivate it. When one candidate in an election dies\nafter polling, he wrote,\n\n[\u2026] the choice to be made among the set \\(S\\) of surviving\ncandidates should be independent of the preferences of individuals for\ncandidates not in \\(S\\). [\u2026] Therefore, we may require of our\nsocial welfare function that the choice made by society from a given\nenvironment depend only on the orderings of individuals among the\nalternatives in that environment (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 26).\n\nEvidently Arrow took this for his choice version\nof the independence condition. He continued:\n\nAlternatively stated, if we consider two sets of individual\norderings such that, for each individual, his ordering of those\nparticular alternatives in a given environment is the same each time,\nthen we require that the choice made by society from that environment\nbe the same when individual values are given by the first set of\norderings as they are when given by the second (Arrow 1951 [1963]:\n26\u201327).\n\nIt is not clear why Arrow thought the case of the dead candidate\ninvolves different values and preference profiles. As he set the\nexample up, it is natural to imagine that everybody\u2019s values and\npreferences stay the same while one candidate becomes unfeasible\n(\u201cwe\u2019d all still prefer \\(A\\), but sadly he\u2019s not with us any\nmore\u201d). Apparently, then, Arrow\u2019s example misses its mark. There\nhas been much discussion of this point in the literature. Hansson\n(1973) argues that Arrow confused his independence condition for\nanother; compare Bordes and Tideman (1991) for a contrary view. For\ndiscussion of several notions of independence whose differences have\nnot always been appreciated, see Ray (1973).\nThe following condition has also been called Independence\nof Irrelevant Alternatives:\n\n(\\(I^*\\)) For all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and all \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) and\n\\(\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle\\) in the domain of \\(f\\), if for all \\(i: xR_{i}y\\)\nif and only if \\(xR^*_{i}y\\), then \\(x f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle y\\) if and\nonly if \\(x f\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle y\\).\n\nIf the intention is to express Arrow\u2019s independence condition this\nis a mistake because \\(I^*\\), though similar in appearance\nto I, has a different content. I says that whenever\neverybody\u2019s preferences concerning a pair of options are the same in\none profile as they are in another, the social preference must also be\nthe same at the two profiles, as far as this pair is concerned. This\nis not what \\(I^*\\) says because the embedded antecedent \u2018for\nall \\(i: xR_{i}y\\) if and only if \\(xR^*_{i}y\\)\u2019 is satisfied\nnot only when everybody\u2019s preferences among \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the\nsame in \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) as they are in \\(\\langle\nR_{i}^*\\rangle\\), but in other instances as well.  For example,\nsuppose that in \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) everybody is indifferent\nbetween some social state \\(T\\) and another state \\(S\\) (in which case\nfor all \\(i\\), both \\(T R_{i} S\\) and \\(S R_{i} T\\)), while in\n\\(\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle\\) everybody strictly prefers \\(T\\) to \\(S\\)\n(for all \\(i\\), \\(T R^*_{i} S\\) but not \\(S R^*_{i} T\\)). Then the\nantecedent \u2018for all \\(i: T R_{i} S\\) if and only if \\(T R^*_{i}\nS\\)\u2019 is satisfied, although individual preferences among \\(T\\)\nand \\(S\\) are not the same in the two profiles. \\(I^*\\) sometimes\nconstrains \\(f\\) though \\(I\\) does not and it is a more demanding\ncondition.\nThe additional demands of \\(I^*\\) are sometimes excessive. Let \\(T\\) be\nthe result of reforming some tried and true status quo, \\(S\\). Now\nsuppose we favor reform if it is generally thought that change will be\nfor the better, but not otherwise. Then we will be on the lookout for\na social welfare function \\(f\\) that derives a strict social preference\nfor \\(T\\) above \\(S\\) when everybody strictly prefers \\(T\\) to \\(S\\), but a\nstrict preference for \\(S\\) above \\(T\\) when everyone is indifferent\nbetween these states. \\(I^*\\) rules out\nevery \\(f\\) that conforms to this desideratum because it requires a weak\nsocial preference for \\(T\\) to \\(S\\) in both cases or in neither.\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives might be said to\nrequire that the social comparison among any given pair of\nalternatives, say social states, depends only on individual\npreferences among this pair. This is correct but it leaves some room\nfor misunderstanding. I says that the\nonly preferences that count are those concerning just these\ntwo social states. That doesn\u2019t mean that preferences are the only\nthing that counts, though. And, indeed, as far as I is\nconcerned, non-welfare features of the two states may also make a\ndifference. \nThe doctrine that individual preferences are the only\nbasis for comparing the goodness of social states is welfarism\n(mentioned already in Section 4.3). An example\nillustrates how nasty it can be:\nIn the status quo \\(S\\), Peter is filthy rich and Paul is abjectly\npoor. Would it be better to take from Peter and give to Paul?  Let \\(T\\)\nbe the social state resulting from transferring a little of Peter\u2019s\nvast wealth to Paul. Paul prefers \\(T\\) to \\(S\\) (\u201cI need to\neat\u201d) and Peter prefers \\(S\\) to \\(T\\) (\u201cnot my\nproblem\u201d). This is one case. Compare it to another. Social state\n\\(T^*\\) arises from a different status quo \\(S^*\\), also by taking from\nPeter and giving to Paul. This time, though, their fortunes are\nreversed. In \\(S^*\\) it is Peter who is poor and Paul is the rich one,\nso this is a matter of taking from the poor to give to the rich. Even\nso, we may assume, the pattern of Peter\u2019s and Paul\u2019s preferences is\nthe same in the second case as it is in the first, because each of\nthem prefers to have more for himself than to have less. Paul prefers\n\\(T^*\\) to \\(S^*\\) (\u201cI need another Bugatti\u201d) and Peter\nprefers \\(S^*\\) to \\(T^*\\) (\u201cwish it were my problem\u201d). Since\neverybody\u2019s preferences are the same in the two cases, welfarism\nrequires that the relative social goodness is the same as well. In\nparticular, it allows us to count \\(T\\) socially better than \\(S\\) only if\nwe also count \\(T^*\\) better than \\(S^*\\).  Whatever we think about taking\nfrom the rich to give to the poor, though, taking from the poor to\ngive to the rich is quite another thing. As Samuelson said of a\nsimilar case, \u201c[o]ne need not be a doctrinaire egalitarian to be\nspeechless at this requirement\u201d (Samuelson 1977: 83).\nCondition I does not express welfarism. Applied to this\nexample, I states that there is to be no change in the social\ncomparison among the status quo \\(S\\) and the result \\(T\\) of\nredistribution unless Peter\u2019s preferences among these states change,\nor Paul\u2019s do (assume they are the only people involved). In this\nsense, the social preference among these states may be said to depend\n\u201conly\u201d on individual preferences among them. I\nsays the same about \\(S^*\\) and \\(T^*\\) or about any other pair of\nalternatives. But I is silent about any relationship between\nthe social comparison among \\(S\\) and \\(T\\), on the one hand, and the\nsocial comparison among \\(S^*\\) and \\(T^*\\), on the other. In particular,\nit leaves a social welfare function free to count \\(T\\) socially better\nthan \\(S\\) (for increasing equality), while also counting \\(T^*\\)\nworse than \\(S^*\\) (for decreasing equality). Intuitively\nspeaking, I allows a social welfare function to \u201cshift\ngears\u201d as we go from one pair of social states to the next,\ndepending on the non-welfare features encountered there. \nThe condition that expresses welfarism is:\n\nStrong Neutrality (SN): For all alternatives \\(x\\),\n\\(y\\), \\(z\\) and \\(w\\), and all profiles \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle\nR_{i}^*\\rangle\\): IF for all \\(i\\): \\(xR_{i}y\\) if and only if \\(zR^*_{i}w\\),\nand \\(yR_{i}x\\) if and only if \\(wR^*_{i}z\\), THEN \\(x f\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle y\\) if and only if \\(z f\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle w\\), and \\(y\nf\\langle R_{i}\\rangle x\\) if and only if \\(w f\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle\nz\\).\n\n SN is more demanding than \nI.[9]\nI requires consistency for each\npair of alternatives separately, as we go from one profile in the\ndomain to the next. SN also requires this, but in addition it requires consistency as\nwe go from one pair to the next, whether that is within a\nsingle profile or among several different ones. This is\nhow SN keeps non-welfare features from making any difference:\nby compelling the social welfare function to treat any two pairs of\nalternatives the same way, if the pattern of individual preference is\nthe same for both.\nSince \\(I^*\\) and SN are logically stronger than I,\nobviously a version of Arrow\u2019s theorem can be had using either one of\nthem instead of I. Such a theorem will be less interesting,\nthough\u2014not only because it is logically weaker but also because,\nas we have seen, these more demanding conditions often are unreasonable.\nThe meaning of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives is\nnot easily grasped, and its ramifications are not immediately obvious.\nIt is therefore surprising to see just how little has been said, over\nthe many decades that have passed since Arrow published his famous\ntheorem, to justify imposing this condition on social welfare\nfunctions. Let us turn, now, to some arguments for and against.\nWe have discussed Arrow\u2019s attempt to motivate I using the\nexample of the dead candidate in an election. In the second edition\nof Social Choice and Individual Values he offered another\nrationale. Independence, he argued, embodies the principle\nthat welfare judgments are to be based on observable behavior. Having\nexpressed approval for Bergson\u2019s use of indifference maps, Arrow\ncontinued:\n\nThe Condition of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives extends\nthe requirement of observability one step farther. Given the set of\nalternatives available for society to choose among, it could be\nexpected that, ideally, one could observe all preferences among the\navailable alternatives, but there would be no way to observe\npreferences among alternatives not feasible for society. (Arrow 1963:\n110)\n\nArrow seems to be saying that social decisions have to be made on\nthe basis of preferences for feasible alternatives because these are\nthe only ones that are observable. Arguably, though, this is\ninsufficient support. Arrow\u2019s choice version of Independence,\nas we have seen, concerns all environments \\(S\\). The\nobservability argument, though, apparently just concerns some\n\u201cgiven\u201d feasible alternatives. See Hansson (1973: 38) on\nthis point.\nGerry Mackie (2003) argues that there has been equivocation on the\nnotion of irrelevance. It is true that we often take nonfeasible\nalternatives to be irrelevant. That presumably is why, in elections,\nwe do not ordinarily put the names of dead people on ballots, along\nwith those of the live candidates. But I also excludes from\nconsideration information on preferences for alternatives that, in an\nordinary sense, are relevant. An example illustrates Mackie\u2019s\npoint. George W. Bush, Al Gore, and Ralph Nader ran in the United\nStates presidential election of 2000. Say we want to know whether\nthere was a social preference for Gore above Bush.  I\nrequires that this question be answerable independently of whether the\npeople preferred either of them to, say, Abraham Lincoln, or preferred\nGeorge Washington to Lincoln. This seems right. Neither Lincoln nor\nWashington ran for President that year. They were, intuitively,\nirrelevant alternatives.  But I also requires that the\nranking of Gore with respect to Bush should be independent of voters\u2019\npreferences for Nader, and this does not seem right because\nhe was on the ballot and, in the ordinary sense, he was a\nrelevant alternative to them. Certainly Arrow\u2019s observability\ncriterion does not rule out using information on preferences for\nNader. They were as observable as any in that election.\nA different rationale has been suggested for\nimposing I specifically\nin the case of voting. Many voting procedures are known to present\nopportunities for voters to manipulate outcomes by misrepresenting\ntheir preferences. Section 5.2 discusses the\nexample of Borda counting, which allows voters to promote their own\nfavorite candidates by strategically putting others\u2019 favorites at the\nbottom of their lists. Borda counting, it will be seen,\nviolates I. Proofs of the Gibbard-Sattherthwaite theorem\n(Gibbard 1973, Sattherthwaite 1975) associate vulnerability to\nstrategic voting systematically with violation of I, and Iain\nMcLean argues on this ground that voting methods ought to satisfy this\ncondition: \u201cTake out [I] and you have gross\nmanipulability\u201d (McLean 2003: 16). This matter of strategic\nvoting did not play a part in Arrow\u2019s presentation of the\nimpossibility theorem, though, and was not dealt with seriously in\nthe literature until after its publication. See the entry\non social choice theory for discussion\nof this important theme in contemporary theory of social choice.\n5. Possibilities\nArrow\u2019s theorem, it has been said, is about the impossibility of\ntrying to do too much with too little information. This remark directs\nattention towards two main avenues leading from Arrow-inspired gloom\ntoward a sunnier view of the possibilities for collective decision\nmaking: not trying to do so much, and using more information. One way\nof not trying to do so much is to relax the requirement, it is a part\nof SO, that all social preferences are\ntransitive.  Section 4.2 briefly considered this\nidea but found it unpromising. Another way is to soften the demand\nof U that there be a social ordering for each\n\u201clogically possible\u201d preference profile. That is, we can\nrestrict the domains of social welfare\nfunctions. Section 5.1 discusses this important\n\u201cescape route\u201d from Arrow\u2019s theorem in some detail. One\nway of using more information is to loosen the independence\nconstraint I. This allows social welfare functions to make\nuse of more of the information that is carried by individual\npreference orderings. See Section 5.2. Another\nway is to extend Arrow\u2019s framework so as to allow individuals to\ncontribute richer information than is carried by preference\norderings. This information can come in the form of scores or grades,\nas discussed in Section 5.3, or in the form of\ncardinal measurements of individual utilities,\nin Section 5.4.\n5.1 Domain Restrictions\nSometimes, in the nature of the alternatives under consideration\nand how individual preferences among them are determined, not all\nindividual preferences can arise. When studying such a case within\nArrow\u2019s framework there is no need for a social welfare function that\ncan handle each and every \\(n\\)-tuple of individual orderings. Some but\nnot all profiles are admissible, and the domain is said to\nbe restricted. In fortunate cases, it is then possible to find a\nsocial welfare function that meets all assumptions and conditions of\nArrow\u2019s theorem\u2014apart, of course, from U. Such domains\nare said to be Arrow consistent. This Section considers some\nimportant examples of Arrow consistent domains.\nFor a simple illustration, consider the following profile: \n\nABC\nABC\nCBA\n\nHere, two of the three people have the same strict preference\nordering. Reckoning the collective preference by pairwise majority\ndecision, it is easy to see that the result is the ordering of this\nmajority: ABC. Consider now a domain made up entirely of\nsuch profiles, in which most of the three voters share the same\nstrict preferences. On such a domain, pairwise majority decision\nalways derives an ordering and so it satisfies SO. This\nsocial welfare function is nondictatorial as well provided the\ndomain, though restricted, still retains a certain variety. In the\nabove profile, voter \\(3\\) strictly prefers \\(B\\) to \\(A\\). Both of the\nothers strictly prefer \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), though, and that is the\nsocial preference: with this profile in the domain, \\(3\\) is no\ndictator. Pairwise majority\ndecision satisfies \nD if each of the voters disagrees in this way with both of\nthe others, in some or other profile.[10]\nIt always satisfies WP\nand I. On such a domain, we have now seen, this aggregation\nprocedure satisfies all of Arrow\u2019s non-domain conditions. Such a\ndomain is Arrow consistent.\nFull identity of preferences is not needed for Arrow\nconsistency. It can be enough that everybody\u2019s preferences are\nsimilar, even if they never entirely agree. An example illustrates the\ncase of single peaked domains.\nSuppose three bears get together to decide how hot their common pot\nof porridge will be. Papa bear likes hot porridge, the hotter the\nbetter. Mama bear likes cold porridge, the colder the better. Baby\nbear most likes warm porridge; hot porridge is next best as far as he\nis concerned (\u201cit will always cool off\u201d), and he doesn\u2019t\nlike cold porridge at all. These preferences among hot, warm and cold\nporridge can be represented as a preference profile:\n\nPapa: Hot Warm Cold\nMama: Cold Warm Hot\nBaby: Warm Hot Cold\n\nOr else they can be pictured like this:\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nThis preference profile is single peaked. Each bear has a\n\u201cbliss point\u201d somewhere along the ordering of the options\nby their temperature, and each bear likes options less and less as we\nmove along this common ordering away from the bliss point, on either\nside. Single peaked preferences arise with respect to the\nleft-right orientation of political candidates, the cost of\nalternative public projects, and other salient attributes of\noptions. Single peaked profiles, in which everybody\u2019s\npreferences are single peaked with respect to a common ordering, arise\nnaturally when everybody cares about the same thing in the options\nunder consideration\u2014temperature, left-right orientation, cost,\nor what have you\u2014even if, as with the bears, there is no further\nconsensus about which options are better than which.\nDuncan Black (1948) showed that if the number of\nvoters is odd, and their preference profile is single peaked,\npairwise majority decision always delivers up an\nordering.[11]\nFurthermore, he showed, the maximum of this ordering is the bliss\npoint of the median voter\u2014the voter whose bliss point\nhas, on the common ordering, as many voters\u2019 bliss points to one side\nas it has to the other. In the example this is Baby bear, and warm\nporridge is the collective maximum.  This example illustrates the way\nin which single peakedness can facilitate compromise.\nSay the number of voters is odd. Now consider a\nsingle-peaked domain\u2014one that is made up entirely of\nsingle peaked profiles. Black\u2019s result tells us that pairwise\nmajority decision on this domain satisfies SO. Provided the\ndomain is sufficiently inclusive (so that for each \\(i\\) there is\nwithin the domain some profile in which \\(i\\) is not the median voter)\nit also satisfies D. Pairwise majority decision always\nsatisfies WP and I, so such a domain is Arrow\nconsistent. With an even number of voters, single peakedness\ndoes not ensure satisfaction of SO. For example, suppose\nthere are just two voters and that their individual orderings are:\n\nCAB\nBCA\n\nPairwise majority decision derives from this profile a weak social\npreference for \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), since there is one who weakly prefers \\(A\\)\nto \\(B\\), and one who weakly prefers \\(B\\) to \\(A\\). Similarly, it derives\na weak social preference for \\(B\\) to \\(C\\). Transitivity requires a weak\nsocial preference for \\(A\\) to \\(C\\), but there is none. On the contrary,\nthere is a strict social preference for \\(C\\) above \\(A\\), since that is\nthe unanimous preference of the voters.  Still, this profile is\nsingle peaked with respect to the common ordering \\(BCA\\):\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nMajority decision with \u201cphantom\u201d voters can be used to\nestablish Arrow consistency when the number of people is even. Let\nthere be \\(2n\\) people, and let each profile in the domain be single\npeaked with respect to one and the same ordering of the\nalternatives. Let \\(R_{2n+1}\\) be an ordering that also is single peaked\nwith respect to this common ordering.  \\(R_{2n+1}\\) represents the\npreferences of a \u201cphantom\u201d voter. Now take each profile\n\\(\\langle R_{1},\\ldots, R_{2n}\\rangle\\) in the domain and expand it\ninto \\(\\langle R_{1},\\ldots, R_{2n}, R_{2n+1}\\rangle\\), by adding\n\\(R_{2n+1}\\). The set of all the expanded profiles is a single peaked\ndomain and, because the real voters together with the phantom are odd\nin number, Black\u2019s result applies to it. Let \\(g\\) be pairwise majority\ndecision for the expanded domain. We obtain a social welfare function\n\\(f\\) for the original domain by assigning to each profile the ordering\nthat \\(g\\) assigns to its expansion. That is, we put:\n\n\\[\nf\\langle R_{1},\\ldots, R_{2n}\\rangle = \n g\\langle R_{1},\\ldots, R_{2n}, R_{2n+1}\\rangle.\n\\]\n\nThis \\(f\\) satisfies SO because \\(g\\) does. It\nsatisfies WP because there are more real voters than\nphantoms (\\(2n\\) to \\(1\\); we could have used any odd number of phantoms\nsmaller than \\(2n\\)). \\(f\\) satisfies I because the phantom\nordering is the same in all profiles of the expanded domain. If the\ndomain includes sufficient variety among profiles then \\(f\\) also\nsatisfies D and is Arrow consistent. This nice idea of\nphantom voters was introduced by Moulin (1980), who used it to\ncharacterize a class of voting schemes that are non-manipulable, in\nthat they do not provide opportunities for strategic\nvoting. \nDomain restrictions have been the focus of much\nresearch in recent decades. Gaertner (2001) provides a general\noverview. Le Breton and Weymark (2006) survey work on domain\nrestrictions that arise naturally when analyzing economic problems in\nArrow\u2019s framework. Miller (1992) suggests that deliberation can\nfacilitate rational social choice by transforming initial preferences\ninto single peaked preferences.  List and Dryzek (2003) argue that\ndeliberation can bring about a \u201cstructuration\u201d of\nindividual preferences that facilitates democratic decision making\neven without achieving full single-peakedness. List et al. (2013)\npresent empirical evidence that deliberation sometimes does have this\neffect.\nAs Samuelson described it, the single profile approach might seem\nto amount to the most severe of domain restrictions:\n\n\n[O]ne and only one of the [\u2026] possible\npatterns of individuals\u2019 orderings is needed. [\u2026]\nFrom it (not from each of them all) comes a social\nordering. (Samuelson 1967: 48\u201349)\n\n According to Sen (1977), though, the\nBergson-Samuelson social welfare function has more than a single\nprofile in its domain. It has in fact a completely unrestricted\ndomain, for while according to Samuelson only one profile is needed\n\u201cit could be any one\u201d (Samuelson 1967: 49). What\ndistinguishes the single profile approach, on Sen\u2019s way of\nunderstanding it, is that there is to be no coordinating the behavior\nof the social welfare function at several different profiles, by\nimposing on it interprofile conditions such as I\nand SN (see Section 4.5). Either\nway, though, and just as Samuelson insisted, Arrow\u2019s theorem does not\nlimit the single profile approach because one of its conditions is\ninappropriate in connection with it. Either U is\ninappropriate (if there is a single profile in the domain) or\nelse I is inappropriate (if there are no interprofile\nconstraints).\nCertain impossibility theorems that are closely related to Arrow\u2019s\nhave been thought relevant to single-profile choice even so. These\ntheorems do not use Arrow\u2019s interprofile condition \\(I\\) but\nuse instead an intraprofile neutrality condition. This\ncondition says that whenever within any single profile the\npattern of individual preferences for one pair \\(x\\),\\(y\\) of options is\nthe same as for another pair \\(z,w\\), the social ordering derived\nfrom this profile must also be the same for \\(x\\), \\(y\\) as it is for \\(z\\),\n\\(w\\):\n\nSingle-Profile Neutrality (SPN): For any \\(\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle\\), and any alternatives \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\) and \\(w\\): IF for all\n\\(i: xR_{i}y\\) if and only if \\(zR_{i}w\\), and \\(yR_{i}x\\) if and only if\n\\(wR_{i}z\\), THEN \\(x f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle y\\) if and only if \\(z f\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle w\\), and \\(y f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle x\\) if and only if \\(w\nf\\langle R_{i}\\rangle z\\).\n\nSPN follows from the strong neutrality (SN)\ncondition of Section 4.5, on identifying\n\\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) with \\(\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle\\). Parks (1976),\nand independently Kemp and Ng (1976), showed that there are\n\u201csingle profile\u201d versions of Arrow\u2019s theorem\nusing SPN instead of I. These theorems were\nsupposed to block the Bergson-Samuelson approach. In fact,\ncondition SPN is just as easily set aside as SN,\nand for the same reason: both exclude non-welfare information that is\nrelevant to the comparison of social states from an ethical\nstandpoint. Samuelson (1977) ridiculed SPN using an example\nabout redistributing chocolate. It is similar in structure to the\nexample of Peter and Paul, in\n Section 4.5.\n5.2 More Ordinal Information\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives severely limits\nwhich information about individual preferences may be used for\nwhat. It requires a social welfare function, when assembling the\nsocial preference among a pair of alternatives, to take into account\nonly those of people\u2019s preferences that concern just this pair. This\nSection discusses two kinds of information that is implicit in\npreferences for other alternatives, and illustrates their use in social\ndecision making: information about the positions of alternatives in\nindividual orderings, and information about the fairness of social\nstates. \nPositional voting methods take into account where the\ncandidates come in the different individual orderings\u2014whether it\nis first, or second, \u2026 or last. Borda counting is an\nimportant example. Named after Jean-Charles de Borda, a contemporary\nof Condorcet, it had already been proposed in the 13th\nCentury by the pioneering writer and social theorist Ramon\nLull. Nicholas of Cusa in the 15th Century recommended it\nfor electing Holy Roman Emperors. Borda counting is used in some\npolitical elections and on many other occasions for voting, in clubs\nand other organizations.  Consider the profile:\n\nABCD\nBACD\nBACD\n\nLet each candidate receive four points for coming first in some\nvoter\u2019s ordering, three for coming second, two for a third place and a\nsingle point for coming last; the alternatives then are ordered by the\ntotal number of points they receive, from all the voters. The Borda\ncount of \\(A\\) is then 10 (or \\(4+3+3\\)) and that of \\(B\\) is 11 \\((3+4+4)\\),\nso \\(B\\) outranks \\(A\\) in the social ordering. This method\napplies with the obvious adaptation to any election with a finite\nnumber of candidates.\nNow suppose voter \\(1\\) moves \\(B\\) from second place to last on his\nown list, and we have the profile:\n\nACDB\nBACD\nBACD\n\nThen \\(B\\) will receive just 9 points \\((1+4+4)\\). \\(A\\) receives\nthe same 10 as before, though, and now outranks \\(B\\). This example\nillustrates two important points.  First, Borda counting does not\nsatisfy Arrow\u2019s condition I, since while each voter\u2019s ranking\nof \\(A\\) with respect to \\(B\\) is the same in the two profiles, the\nsocial ordering of this pair is different. Second, Borda counting\nprovides opportunities for voters to manipulate the outcome of an\nelection by strategic voting. If everybody\u2019s preferences are as in the\nfirst profile, voter \\(1\\) might do well to misrepresent his\npreferences by putting \\(B\\) at the bottom of his list. In this way,\nhe can promote his own favorite, \\(A\\), to the top of the social\nordering (he will get away with this, of course, only if the other\nvoters do not see what he is up to and adjust their own rankings\naccordingly, by putting his favorite \\(A\\) at the bottom). The\nsusceptibility of Borda counting to strategic voting has long been\nknown. When this was raised as an objection, Borda\u2019s indignant\nresponse is said to have been that his scheme was intended for honest\npeople. Lull and Nicholas of Cusa recommended, before voting by this\nmethod, earnest oaths to tell the truth and stripping oneself of all\nsins.\n\nFor further discussion of positionalist voting methods, see the\nentries voting methods\nand social choice theory; for an\nanalytical overview, see Pattanaik\u2019s (2002) handbook article. Barber\u00e0\n(2010) reviews what is known about strategic voting. \nMark Fleurbaey (2007) has shown that social welfare functions need\nmore ordinal information than I allows them if they are to\nrespond appropriately to a certain fairness of social states. He gives\nthe example of Ann, who has ten apples and two oranges, and Bob, with\nthree apples and eleven oranges. This allocation is said to be\n\u201cenvy free\u201d if, intuitively, she is at least as happy with\nher own basket of fruit as she would be with his and, similarly, he is\nas happy with his own basket as he would be with hers. Let the\ndistribution of fruit in one social state \\(S\\) be as described, and\nconsider the state \\(S^*\\) in which the allocations are reversed. That\nis, in \\(S^*\\) it is Ann that has three apples and eleven oranges,\nwhile Bob has ten apples and two oranges. More technically, \\(S\\)\nis envy free if Ann weakly prefers \\(S\\) to \\(S^*\\), and Bob\ndoes too. We might expect that, other things being equal, the envy\nfreeness of a social state will promote it in the social ordering\nabove an alternative state that is not envy free. But I does\nnot allow this.\n\nTo see why not, consider whether it would be socially preferable,\nstarting from the status quo \\(S\\), to take one apple and one orange\nfrom Bob and give both of them to Ann. Let \\(T\\) be the state arising\nfrom this transfer. We assume for the sake of the example that Ann\nalways strictly prefers having more of everything for herself to\nhaving less, and that Bob\u2019s preferences are similarly self-interested,\nso that in all admissible profiles Ann strictly prefers \\(T\\) to\n\\(S\\), while Bob strictly prefers \\(S\\) to \\(T\\). Their preferences\namong these states are opposite and do not by themselves entail a\nsocial preference one way or the other. Now, consider first a profile\nin which the status quo \\(S\\) is envy free but \\(T\\) is not. (Let both\nAnn and Bob be indifferent between the baskets each one has in \\(S\\)\nbut not between those in \\(T\\), in which both agree that Bob is worse\noff.) Relative to this profile, a social welfare function promoting\nenvy freeness comes out against the transfer from Bob to Ann by\nranking \\(S\\) strictly above \\(T\\). But consider another profile, in\nwhich it is \\(T\\) that is envy free (now Ann and Bob are indifferent\nbetween the baskets in \\(T\\), and agree that in \\(S\\) Ann is worse off\nthan Bob). Relative to this second profile, \\(T\\) outranks \\(S\\) in\nthe social ordering. In direct conflict with I, the social\npreference among \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) switches as we go from one profile to\nthe other, although the individual preferences among \\(S\\) and \\(T\\)\nstay the same. The social ranking of \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) turns on\npreferences among these states and the \u201cirrelevant\u201d\n\\(S^*\\) and similarly defined \\(T^*\\), because the fairness of \\(S\\)\nand \\(T\\) does.\nFleurbaey recommends a weaker condition, attributing it to Hansson\n(1973) and to Pazner (1979):\n\nWeak Independence: Social preferences on a pair of options\nshould only depend on the population\u2019s preferences on these two\noptions and on what options are indifferent to each of these options\nfor each individual (Fleurbaey 2007: 23).\n\nFleurbaey (2007) discusses social welfare functions satisfying weak\nindependence together with Arrow\u2019s conditions apart, of course,\nfrom I. The approach to social welfare that is sketched there\nis developed at length in (Fleurbaey and Maniquet 2011).\n5.3 Even More Ordinal Information: Scores and Grades\n\nAnother way to have social orderings in spite of Arrow\u2019s theorem is to\nallow people to contribute more ordinal information about their\npreferences than is admissible within Arrow\u2019s framework. Arrow\u2019s\npurpose in limiting individual inputs to weak orderings of the\nalternatives was to exclude cardinal information about utilities. This\nlimitation, though, is too tight for its purpose. One way for people\nto communicate their preferences is to grade their\nalternatives. Now, although in general grades do not carry cardinal\ninformation, Arrow\u2019s framework has no provision for people to input\ntheir preferences using them. This might seeem a small oversight on\nArrow\u2019s part but it is critical, because there are ways of aggregating\ngraded inputs that are not avaliable for preferance orderings, and\nwith them comes another \u201cescape\u201d from Arrow\u2019s\nimpossibility. Showing how it goes requires a slight extension of\nArrow\u2019s framework.\n\nLet a grade language \\(L\\) be a strictly ordered collection\nof expressions, the grades. The grades could be adjectival expressions\nof a natural language, such as excellent, \ngood, acceptable, poor and terrible,\nor they could be characters such as the familiar letter grades of\nacademic evaluation. They could be numerals (then often\ncalled scores) or the strings of stars commonly used to\nevaluate hotels and restaurants. They could be any symbols that come\nin some fixed order (from \u201ctop\u201d to\n\u201cbottom\u201d).\n\nA grade function \\(G_{i}\\) maps the set \\(X\\) of alternatives\ninto some given grade language \\(L\\). Intuitively, \\(G_{i}(x)\\) is\n\\(i\\)\u2019s grade for alternative \\(x\\). A grade function \\(G_{i}\\)\ncontains as much information as some weak ordering \\(R_{i}\\)\nof the alternatives. This can be seen by putting \\(xR_{i}y\\) if\n\\(G_{i}(x) \\ge G_{i}(y)\\): \\(i\\) weakly prefers \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) if\n\\(i\\)\u2019s grade for \\(x\\) is at least as high as \\(i\\)\u2019s grade for\n\\(y\\). In general \\(G_{i}\\) contains more information than\nthe corresponding ordering because we cannot always go in reverse:\ndifferent grade functions correspond to the same ordering. For\ninstance, one way to convey that \\(A\\) is preferable to \\(B\\) is to\nsay that whereas \\(A\\) is good, \\(B\\) is\nmerely acceptable; another is to say that whereas \\(A\\)\nis good, \\(B\\) is terrible, but this doesn\u2019t come to\nthe same thing because acceptable and terrible\ndon\u2019t. The additional information in grades is in general not cardinal\ninformation because for instance the expressions \ngood, acceptable and terrible, ordinary\nadjectives of English, do not carry cardinal information about how\ngood \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are.\n\nA grade profile is a list \\(\\langle G_{1}, \\ldots,\nG_{n}\\rangle\\) of grade functions, one for each of the people \\(1,\n\\ldots, n\\). Notions of a multiprofile domain and a social welfare\nfunction \\(f\\) are defined as in Arrow\u2019s framework, putting grade\nprofiles instead of Arrow\u2019s profiles of weak orders (the output of a\nsocial welfare function is not a social grading of the alternatives\nbut a social ordering of them, just in Arrow\u2019s original\nframework). The conditions of Arrow\u2019s theorem are reformulated\naccordingly; for instance, the reformulated domain assumption is: \n\nUnrestricted Domain (U): The domain of \\(f\\)\nincludes every list \\(\\langle G_{1}, \\ldots, G_{n}\\rangle\\) of \\(n\\)\ngrade functions defined on \\(X\\).\n\n Arrow\u2019s independence condition becomes:\n\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives (I): For\nall alternatives \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(X\\), and all profiles \\(\\langle\nG_{i}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle G^*_{i}\\rangle\\) in the domain of \\(f\\), if\n\\(\\langle G_{i}\\rangle|\\{x,y\\} = \\langle G^*_{i}\\rangle|\\{x,y\\}\\), then\n\\(f\\langle G_{i}\\rangle |\\{x,y\\} = f\\langle G^*_{i}\\rangle\n|\\{x,y\\}\\).\n\n\nIntuitively, the reformulated independence assumption says that\nwhether one alternative ranks higher than another in the social\nordering depends only on everybody\u2019s grades for these two\nalternatives. Other alternatives are in this matter\n\u201cirrelevant.\u201d\n\nThere are social welfare functions that satisfy all conditions of\nArrow\u2019s theorem, reformulated for graded inputs. With an odd number\n\\(n\\) of people, for instance, the social welfare function median\ngrading fills the bill. Given a profile \\(\\langle G_{i}\\rangle\\)\nof grade functions, the median grade for an alternative \\(x\\)\nis the grade that is in the middle, when we list all the grades\n\\(G_{1}(x), \\ldots, G_{n}(x)\\) for \\(x\\) in order, from top to\nbottom. The social ordering associated with this profile goes by the\nalternatives\u2019 median grades: \\(x f\\langle G_{i}\\rangle y\\) means that\nthe median grade for \\(x\\) is either the same as the median grade for\n\\(y\\), or else it is higher.\n\nTo verify that median grading satisfies the reformulated conditions,\ntake for instance the nondictatorship condition. A person \\(d\\) is\na dictator of \\(f\\) if for any alternatives \\(x\\) and \\(y\\),\nand for any profile \\(\\langle\\ldots, G_{d},\\ldots\\rangle\\) in the\ndomain of \\(f\\): if \\(xP_{d}y\\), then \\(xPy\\). When \\(f\\) is median\ngrading, this means that whenever a dictator expresses a strict\npreference for one alternative over another, by giving it a higher\ngrade, this alternative also ranks strictly higher in the social\nordering, having a higher median grade. Except in the trivial case of\na language with only a single grade (which makes it impossible to\nexpress strict preferences, giving everybody vacuous dictatorial\npowers), and provided there are at least two alternatives and three\npeople, median grading on an unrestricted domain has no dictator. To\nsee that it is so, consider any given person \\(p\\), and any two\nalternatives \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). In an unrestricted domain there is some\nprofile in which \\(p\\)\u2019s grade for \\(A\\) is higher than \\(p\\)\u2019s grade\nfor \\(B\\), but in which everybody else\u2019s grades for these alternatives\nare just the other way around: everybody other than \\(p\\) gives to\n\\(B\\) the same grade that \\(p\\) gives to \\(A\\), and gives to \\(A\\) the\nsame grade that \\(p\\) gives to \\(B\\). In this profile, the median\ngrade for \\(A\\) is \\(p\\)\u2019s grade for \\(B\\), and the median grade for\n\\(B\\) is \\(p\\)\u2019s grade for \\(A\\), which is higher. So although \\(p\\)\nstrictly prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(B\\) ranks strictly higher than\n\\(A\\) in the social ordering, and \\(p\\) is not a dictator. Repeating\nthis demonstration for each person, no one else is a dictator\neither. Satisfaction of the other reformulated conditions on the\nunrestricted domain of grade profiles is similarly\nstraightforward.\n\nMichel Balinski and Rida Laraki (2007) showed that scoring and grading\nenable an \u201cescape\u201d from Arrow\u2019s impossibility while\nstaying within an ordinal framework. Their theory of majority\njudgment is a generalization of median grading that makes more\nuse than it does of the ordinal information in grade profiles\n(Balinski and Laraki 2010). Balinski and Laraki insist that people\nmust share what they call a \u201ccommon language\u201d of grades,\nwithout giving this notion a precise sense. Indeed it can be shown\nthat, when different people might have very different thresholds for\nawarding grades, there is in grade profiles no more information than\nin the corresponding profiles of weak orderings. Then a close relative\nof Arrow\u2019s impossibility returns (Morreau 2016).\n\nArrow came to realize, late in his life, that scoring and grading\ncreate possibilities for democracy that his framework unnecessarily\nrules out of consideration. In a 2012 interview he noted:\n\nNow there\u2019s another possible way of thinking about it, which is not\nincluded in my theorem \\(\\ldots\\) [E]ach voter does not just give a\nranking. But says, this is good. And this is not good. Or this is very\ngood. And this is bad. So I have three or four classes \\(\\ldots\\) This\nchanges the nature of voting.\n\n\nFor a transcript of this interview, see the Other Internet Resources.\n5.4 Cardinal Information\n\nAmartya Sen (1970) extended Arrow\u2019s framework by representing the\npreferences of individuals \\(i\\) as utility functions \\(U_{i}\\) that\nmap the alternatives onto real numbers: \\(U_{i}(x)\\) is the utility\nthat \\(i\\) obtains from \\(x\\).  A preference profile in Sen\u2019s\nframework is a list \\(\\langle U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{n}\\rangle\\) of utility\nfunctions, and a domain is a set of these. An aggregation function,\nnow a social welfare functional, maps each profile in some\ndomain onto a weak ordering of the alternatives.\nSen showed how to study various assumptions concerning the\nmeasurability and interpersonal comparability of utilities by\ncoordinating the social orderings derived from profiles that,\ndepending on these assumptions, carry the same information. For\ninstance, ordinal measurement with interpersonal\nnoncomparability\u2014built by Arrow right into his technical\nframework\u2014amounts, in Sen\u2019s more flexible set up, to a\nrequirement that the same social ordering is to be derived from any\nutility profiles that reduce to the same list of orderings. At the\nother extreme, utilities are measured on a ratio scale with full\ninterpersonal comparability if those profiles yield the same social\nordering that can be obtained from each other by rescaling, or\nmultiplying all utility functions by the same positive real number.\nSen explored different combinations of such assumptions.\nOne important finding was that having cardinal utilities is not by\nitself enough to avoid an impossibility result. In addition, utilities\nhave to be interpersonally comparable. Intuitively speaking, to put\ninformation about preference strengths to good use it has to be\npossible to compare the strengths of different individuals\u2019\npreferences. See Sen (1970: Theorem 8*2). Interpersonal comparability\nopens up many possibilities for aggregating utilities and preferences.\nTwo important ones can be read off from classical utilitarianism and\nRawls\u2019s difference principle. For details, see the entry\non social choice theory.\n6. Reinterpretations\n\nThe Arrow-Sen framework lends itself to the study of a range of\naggregation problems other than those for which it was originally\ndeveloped. This Section briefly discusses some of them. \n6.1 Judgment Aggregation\n\nOn an epistemic conception, the value of democratic institutions lies,\nin part, in their tendency to arrive at the truth in matters relevant\nto public decisions (see Estlund 2008, but compare Peter 2011). This\nidea receives some support from Condorcet\u2019s jury theorem. It tells us,\nsimply put, that if individual people are more likely than not to\njudge correctly in some matter of fact, independently of one another,\nthen the collective judgment of a sufficiently large group, arrived at\nby majority voting, is almost certain to be correct (Condorcet\n1785). The phenomenon of the \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d,\nfacilitated by cognitive diversity among individuals, provides further\nand arguably better support for the epistemic conception (Page 2007,\nLandemore 2012). But there are theoretical limits to the possibilities\nfor collective judgment on matters of fact. Starting with Kornhauser\nand Sager\u2019s (1986) discussion of group deliberation in legal settings,\nwork on the theory of judgment aggregation has explored paradoxes and\nimpossibility theorems closely related to those that Condorcet and\nArrow discovered in connection with preference aggregation. See List\n(2012) and the entry social choice\ntheory for overviews.\n6.2 Multi-Criterial Decision\nIn many decision problems there are several criteria by which to\ncompare alternatives and, putting these criteria in place of people,\nit is natural to study such problems within the Arrow-Sen framework.\nArrow\u2019s theorem, if analogues of its various assumptions and\nconditions are appropriate, then tells us that there is no procedure\nfor arriving at an \u201coverall\u201d ordering that assimilates\ndifferent criterial comparisons.\nThe Arrow-Sen framework has been used to study multi-criterial\nevaluation in industrial decision making (Arrow and Raynaud 1986) and\nin engineering design (Scott and Antonsson 2000; compare Franssen\n2005). Anandi Hattiangadi (forthcoming) argues that Arrow\u2019s theorem\nlimits the possibilities for an interpretationist metasemantics, in\nwhich the correct interpretation of linguistic expressions is the one\nthat is, judging by relevant criteria, overall best.\nKenneth May (1954) used Arrow\u2019s framework to study the\ndetermination of individual preferences. It had been found\nexperimentally that people\u2019s preferences, elicited separately for\ndifferent pairs of options, often are cyclical. May explained this by\nanalogy with the paradox of voting as the result of preferring one\nalternative to another when it is better by more criteria than not.\nMore generally, he reinterpreted Arrow\u2019s theorem as an argument that\nintransitivity of individual preferences is to be expected when\ndifferent criteria \u201cpull in different directions\u201d. Susan\nHurley (1985, 1989) considered a similar problem in practical\ndeliberation when the criteria are moral values. She argued that\nArrow\u2019s theorem does not apply in this case. One strand of her\nargument is that, unlike a person, a moral criterion can rank any\ngiven alternatives just one way. It cannot \u201cchange its\nmind\u201d about them (Hurley 1985: 511), and this makes it\ninappropriate to impose the analogue of the domain\ncondition U on procedures for weighing moral reasons.  \nThere are multicriterial problems in theoretical deliberation as\nwell. Okasha (2011) uses the Arrow-Sen framework to study the problem\nof choosing among rival scientific theories by criteria including fit\nto data, simplicity, and scope. He argues that the impossibility\ntheorem threatens the rationality of theory choice. See Morreau (2015)\nfor a reason to think that it does not apply to this problem, and\nMorreau (2014) for a demonstration that impossibility theorems\nrelevant to single profile choice (see \nSections 2.2 and 5.1) \nmight sometimes apply even so. In related work, Jacob Stegenga (2013)\nargues that Arrow\u2019s theorem limits the possibilities for combining\ndifferent kinds of evidence. Eleonora Cresto and Diego Tajer\n(forthcoming) counter that confirmational holism requires a\nrestriction on the domains of evidence-aggregation functions that\nblocks Stegenga\u2019s argument: they cast the Duhem problem in a positive\nlight as one aspect of a phenomenon that makes evidence aggregation\npossible.\n6.3 Overall Similarity\nThings are more similar to each other in one respect, less similar\nin another. Much philosophy relies on notions of aggregate or\n\u201coverall\u201d similarity and Arrow\u2019s framework has also been used\nto study these.\nOverall similarity lies at the foundation of David Lewis\u2019s\nmetaphysics (Lewis 1968, 1973a, 1973b). He wrote little about how\nsimilarities and differences in various respects might go together to\nyield overall similarities, though (Lewis 1979) gives some idea of\nwhat he had in mind. The Arrow-Sen framework lends itself to studying\nthis aggregation problem as well; and an impossibility theorem, if it\napplies, limits the possibilities for arriving at overall similarities\nof the sort that Lewis presupposes. Morreau (2010) presents the case\nthat a variant of Arrow\u2019s theorem does apply. Kroedel and Huber (2013)\ntake a more optimistic view of overall similarity.\nAccording to Popper (1963), some scientific theories, though false,\nare closer to the truth than others. Work on his notion\nof verisimilitude has distinguished \u201clikeness\u201d\nand \u201ccontent\u201d dimensions, and the question arises whether\nthese can be combined into a single ordering of theories by their\noverall verisimilitude. Zwart and Franssen (2007) argue that Arrow\u2019s\ntheorem does not apply to this problem but, using a theorem inspired\nby it, they argue that there is no good way to combine the different\ndimensions even so. See Schurz and Weingartner (2010) and Oddie (2013)\nfor constructive criticism of their views.\n",
