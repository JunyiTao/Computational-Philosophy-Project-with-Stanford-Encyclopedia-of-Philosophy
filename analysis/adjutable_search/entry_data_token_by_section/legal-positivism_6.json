    "main_text": "Law and Its Merits || The Separability Thesis\n4.3 The Neutrality Thesis\n\nThe preceding theses together establish that law is not\nvalue-neutral. Although some lawyers regard this idea as a revelation\n(and others as provocation) it is in fact banal. The thought that law\ncould be value neutral does not even rise to falsity\u2014it is\nincoherent. Law is a normative system, promoting certain values and\nrepressing others. Law is not neutral between victim and murderer or\nbetween owner and thief. When people complain of the law\u2019s lack\nof neutrality, they are in fact voicing very different aspirations,\nsuch as the demand that it be fair, just, impartial, and so forth. A\ncondition of law\u2019s achieving any of these ideals is that it is\nnot neutral in either its aims or its effects.\n\nPositivism is however sometimes more credibly associated with the idea\nthat legal philosophy is or should be value-neutral. Kelsen,\nfor example, says, \u201cthe function of the science of law is not\nthe evaluation of its subject, but its value-free description\u201d\n(1960 [1967: 68]) and Hart at one point described his work as\n\u201cdescriptive sociology\u201d (1961 [2012: v]). But a\ndescription of what? \u201cLaw\u201d is an anthropocentric subject,\ndependent not merely on our sensory embodiment but also, as its\nnecessary connections to morality show, on our moral sense and\ncapacities. Legal kinds such as courts, decisions, and rules will not\nappear in a purely physical description of the universe and may not\neven appear in every social description. (This may limit the prospects\nfor a \u201cnaturalized\u201d jurisprudence; though for a defense of\nthe contrary view, see Leiter 1997). Legal positivism, to be sure, is\nnot an \u201cevaluation of its subject\u201d, i.e., an evaluation of\nthe law. And to say that the existence of law depends on\nsocial facts does not commit one to thinking that it is a good thing\nthat this is so (nor does it preclude it: see MacCormick 1985 and\nCampbell 1996). But it does not follow that legal philosophy therefore\noffers a \u201cvalue-free description\u201d of its subject. There is\na sense, of course, in which every description is value-laden. It\nselects and systematizes only a subset of the infinite number of facts\nabout its subject. To describe law as resting on customary social\nrules is to omit many other truths about it including, for example,\ntruths about its connection to the demand for paper or silk. What\nforms the warrant for our prioritizing the former over the latter?\nFinnis (1980 [2011: 3\u201319]) thinks that the only possibility here\nhas to do with the moral reasons we might have for wanting law (that\nwe answer \u201cwhat?\u201d by answering \u201cwhy?\u201d) and\nthat the failure of methodological positivism, the failure to achieve\na value-free description of the subject, results in the failure of\nlegal positivism. But the question of social significance is not\nexhausted by our moral register, and especially not only by its\npositive valence (on which see Dickson 2001). Others point to the\nnotion of conceptual or metaphysical truth as setting the bounds of\nthe question that positivism seeks to answer (for discussion see Raz\n2004b). But however these difficult issues are to be resolved, we\nshould not expect legal positivism itself to contribute much. A thesis\nabout the nature of law is not at the same time a thesis about how to\nunderstand the nature of law.\n\nIt may seem, however, that legal positivism at least requires a stand\non the so-called \u201cfact-value\u201d problem. There is no doubt\nthat certain positivists, especially Kelsen, believe this to be so. In\nreality, positivism may cohabit with a range of views here\u2014value\nstatements may be entailed by factual statements; values may supervene\non facts; values may be kinds of fact. Legal positivism requires only\nthat it be in virtue of its facticity rather than its meritoriousness\nthat something is law, and that we can describe that facticity without\nassessing its merits.\n\nEvaluative argument is, of course, central to the philosophy of law\nmore generally. No legal philosopher can be only a legal\npositivist. A complete understanding of law requires also an account\nof what kinds of things could possibly count as the merits of law\n(must law be efficient or elegant as well as just?); of what role law\nshould play in adjudication (should valid law always be applied?); of\nwhat claim law has on our obedience (is there a duty to obey?); and\nalso the more practical questions of what laws we should have and\nwhether we should have law at all. Legal positivism does not aspire to\nanswer these questions (although cf. Murphy 2014: 88\u2013108 for the\nargument that the theory has important first-order implications for\nlegal practice). Nonetheless, positivism\u2019s claim that the\nexistence and content of law depends only on social facts does give\nthem shape.\n",
