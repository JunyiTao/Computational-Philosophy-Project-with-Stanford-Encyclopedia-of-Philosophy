    "main_text": "\n\nWilliam Heytesbury (c. 1313\u20131372/3), a member of Oxford\u2019s\nMerton College and the School of \u201cOxford Calculators\u201d, was\nmost likely a student of Richard Kilvington, who was a younger\ncontemporary of John Dumbleton. Heytesbury developed the works of\nThomas Bradwardine and Richard Kilvington, and he was also influenced\nby Walter Burley, William Ockham, and Roger Swyneshed (or Swineshead).\nHe authored a popular textbook Regulae solvendi sophismata\nand several other collections of sophisms. He linked interests in\nlogic, mathematics, and physics. He formulated the Middle Degree\nTheorem (also known as the Mean Speed Theorem) offering a proper rule\nfor uniformly accelerated motion, later developed by Galileo. His\nworks anticipated nineteenth-century mathematical analyses of the\ncontinuum. He influenced logic in Britain and Italy (where several\nlate fourteenth and early fifteenth-century editions of his texts were\nprinted) and his influence lasted until the sixteenth century, when\nthe debates he participated in declined.\n",
