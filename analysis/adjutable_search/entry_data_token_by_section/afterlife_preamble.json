    "main_text": "\n\nOne of the points where there is a significant, long-lasting\nintersection of the interests of many philosophers with the interests\nof many people of all kinds and conditions concerns the nature and\nsignificance of death. How should we understand the mortality of all\nliving things and, closer to home, how should we understand our own\nmortality? Is it possible for persons to survive biological death?\nThis is a topic that has occupied both analytic and continental\nphilosophy in the twentieth century (e.g., Fred Feldman, Martin\nHeidegger). When the topic of death is ignored or denied in popular\nculture, some philosophers, theologians, social and political critics\nrail against the inauthentic complacency of ignoring one of the most\nimportant facts about our lives (see, for example, S\u00f8ren\nKierkegaard\u2019s essay \u201cAt a Graveside\u201d or Ernest\nBecker\u2019s famous 1974 book, The Denial of Death). But\nwhat precisely are the facts of death? Is it true that a person is\nannihilated when she dies, or is there a possibility or even a\nlikelihood that she may survive death? Are any of the religious\nconceptions of an afterlife promising from a philosophical point of\nview?\n\nThere are five sections in this entry. In the first, we propose that\nbeliefs about death and the possibility of an afterlife are of\nenduring significance because of our care for persons here and now,\nand thus our concern for their future and our own. Just as it is\nreasonable to hope that those we love have a fulfilling future in this\nlife, it is natural to consider whether this life is the only life\nthere is and, if there is reason to believe that there is an afterlife\n(or a life beyond this life), it would be reasonable to hope that this\nmight involve a new, valuable environment or at least one that is not\nHellish in nature. We bring to the fore other reasons why the topic of\nan afterlife is philosophically interesting. In sections two and three\nwe consider the concept and possibility that persons survive death in\nlight of two substantial philosophies of mind: dualism (section two)\nand materialism (section three). Section four addresses the afterlife\nin terms of empirical evidence. In section five, reasons are advanced\nfor thinking that the reasonability of beliefs about an afterlife\ndepends on the reasonability of metaphysical convictions.\n",
