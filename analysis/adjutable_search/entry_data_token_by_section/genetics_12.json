The\nemergence of relatively fast and cheap gene-editing technologies like\nCRISPR-Cas9 has made the debates over genetic enhancement feel much\nmore pressing (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and\nMedicine 2017). The ethical stakes have not really changed, but the\nsense that discussions have shifted from purely hypothetical to\npotentially realistic has changed.\n\nPhilosophical critics of enhancement offer a number of cautions\nagainst the practice. Michael Sandel famously associated desires for\nenhancement with hubris, where contentment with what nature (and\nchance) present was the more virtuous attitude (Sandel 2002). Parental\nattempts to genetically enhance a child were also criticized on the\ngrounds that they violated the autonomy of the child because parents\nwere seeking too much control over the child\u2019s future (Habermas\n2003). Philosophers also warned of an unjust future made up of genetic\n\u201chaves\u201d (those who have benefited from enhancement) and\n\u201chave nots\u201d (those who remained unenhanced)\u2014a\nscenario popularized in the film GATTACA (entry:\n theory and bioethics).\n\nDefenders of enhancement were quick to point out that many of the\narguments against enhancing were not reasonably confined to just\ngenetic technologies. Parents control their child\u2019s future when\nthey send her to space camp rather than soccer camp; likewise, wealthy\nparents are able to enhance their children with all sorts of\neducational resources, like tutors, that poor parents cannot provide,\nand these surely contribute to disparities. But parents are given wide\nlatitude to decide what camp their child will attend and how much they\nwill (or won\u2019t) invest in their child\u2019s educational\ndevelopment. Julian Savulescu (2001) even argued that parents are\nobligated to take advantage of genetic technologies if they offer\nopportunities to increase the chances of a child living the best life.\nOf course, just what counts as the \u201cbest life\u201d is an\ninherently value-laden judgment, and critics pointed out that\nSavulescu\u2019s characterization of it looked frighteningly similar\nto the vision promoted by eugenicists a century ago (entries:\n parenthood and procreation;\n eugenics).\n",
