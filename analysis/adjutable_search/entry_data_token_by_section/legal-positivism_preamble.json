    "main_text": "\n\nLegal positivism is the thesis that the existence and content of law\ndepends on social facts and not on its merits. The English jurist John\nAustin (1790\u20131859) formulated it thus: \n\n\nThe existence of law is one thing; its merit and demerit another.\nWhether it be or be not is one enquiry; whether it be or be not\nconformable to an assumed standard, is a different enquiry. (1832\n[1995: 157]) \n\n\nThe positivist thesis does not say that law\u2019s merits are\nunintelligible, unimportant, or peripheral to the philosophy of law.\nIt says that they do not determine whether laws or legal systems\nexist. Whether a society has a legal system depends on the\npresence of certain structures of governance, not on the extent to\nwhich it satisfies ideals of justice, democracy, or the rule of law.\nWhat laws are in force in that system depends on what social standards\nits officials recognize as authoritative; for example, legislative\nenactments, judicial decisions, or social customs. The fact that a\npolicy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient\nreason for thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it\nis unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason\nfor doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has\nbeen posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.). Austin\nthought the thesis \u201csimple and glaring\u201d. While it is\nprobably the dominant view among analytically inclined philosophers of\nlaw, it is also the subject of competing interpretations together with\npersistent criticisms and misunderstandings.\n",
