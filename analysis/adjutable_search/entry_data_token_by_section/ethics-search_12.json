    "main_text": "Moral Accountability and Social-Responsibility Issues for Search Engine Companies || Commerce-Related Conflicts for SECs\n4.1 Commerce-Related Conflicts for SECs\n\n\nConsider one kind of conflict involving bias and profit\nfor SECs. Nicas (2011, 1) points out that while many SECs were\ninitially \u201ccontent to simply produce search results,\u201d some\nare now very much involved in diverse markets, \u201coffering\neverything from online music to local coupons to mobile phones.\u201d\nNicas also describes a bias-related concern affecting this trend by\nnoting that when Google entered into the online travel business, it\n\u201cbegan placing its new flight-search service atop general search\nresults\u201d \u2013 i.e., above those of other major players in the\nonline travel business such as Orbitz and Expedia. Because Google also\nengages in these kinds of practices in EU countries, where an estimated\n85% of users select Google either as their main or sole search engine,\nit has and continues to face charges of anti-trust violations. In\nEurope, Google has been formally charged with \u201csystematically\nfavoring its own comparison shopping product\u201d by prominently\ndisplaying that product/service in its search returns,\n\u201cirrespective of its merits\u201d and at the expense of its\ncompetitors (Chappell 2016). If the accounts provided by Nicas,\nChappell, and others are correct, it would seem that there are good\nreasons to be concerned about commercial conflicts involving major SECs such as Google.\n\n\nA relatively new bias-related conflict for SECs has recently surfaced\nin connection with \u201cvoice search,\u201d which is becoming\nincreasingly popular with users of mobile devices. Barysevich (2016)\nnotes that voice search is the \u201cfastest growing type of\nsearch,\u201d pointing to statistics in the U.S.showing that 55% of\nteenagers and approximately 40% of adults use this mode of search on a\ndaily basis.  Why are users\u2019 searches trending in the direction\nof voice versus (\u201ctraditional\u201d) text? Hawkins (2017, Other\nInternet Resources) offers two reasons: (a) voice search is faster\nthan text, since most people also tend to speak much more quickly than\nthey type; and (b) voice search is hands-free, which is convenient for\npeople using mobile devices. Given Google\u2019s preeminence \u2013\nand some might even say its \u201cdominance\u201d \u2013 in the\nonline \u201csearch industry\u201d to date, one might assume that\nGoogle has also been the lead player in the emerging area of voice\nsearch. But Hawkins points out that Bing has had an edge over Google\nin the voice-search market thus far. He attributes this to the fact\nthat Apple\u2019s Siri, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana, and Amazon\u2019s\nAlexa \u2013 three of the four major \u201cvirtual assistants\u201d\non the market \u2013 use Bing for their searches. Of course, one\nmight well expect that Microsoft\u2019s voice-assistant applications\nwould direct its users\u2019 searches to Bing, and that\nGoogle\u2019s voice assistants would do likewise in directing users\nto its search engine. But one could also question whether voice-search\nusers, especially of products/services other than Microsoft\u2019s\nand Google\u2019s, should be given an explicit option to set default\nvoice-search requests on their devices to a specific search engine of\ntheir choice?  Otherwise, companies like Amazon and Apple could be\nperceived as biased because of their tilting, even if unintentionally,\nthe voice-search market toward Bing (and away from Google)? However,\nsince Google has already cornered so much of the existing search and\nsearch-related markets, it might be difficult for us to view that SEC\nas somehow itself a victim of (search) bias.\n\n\nSome critics have pointed out that conflicts of interest involving\nSECs are not limited to bias and unfair business practices in the\ncommercial sector, but can also affect the free flow of knowledge in\nsociety. For example, Carr (2011, 163) worries that the commercial\ncontrol that Google and other major SECs now have over the\n\u201cdistribution of digital information\u201d could ultimately lead\nto \u201crestrictions on the flow of knowledge.\u201d And Hinman\n(2008, 67) believes that the control of knowledge that SECs have is\n\u201cin a very fundamental sense, a public trust, yet it remains\nfirmly ensconced in private hands and behind a veil of corporate\nsecrecy.\u201d Much of this secrecy, as we have seen, is closely tied\nto the proprietary search algorithms that major search engines use,\nwhich also raises the question of whether aspects of these algorithms\nshould be more transparent to the general public. But Elgesem (p. 241)\nbelieves that SECs should not be required to disclose information about\ntheir proprietary search algorithms, arguing instead that they should\nbe required to (a) make their policies known to users and (b) follow\nthose policies as closely as possible.\n\n\nWe conclude this section by noting that SECs continue to face some\ncritical challenges with respect to fulfilling their \u201cgatekeeper\nrole\u201d in a socially responsible way, while simultaneously\nprotecting both their proprietary algorithms and the interests of their\nshareholders to whom they also have legal and moral obligations. In the\nremainder of Section 4, we focus our attention on two different kinds\nof accountability-related ethical concerns affecting SECs: (i)\nmoral responsibility/legal liability issues arising\nin cases where search engines have provided links to Web sites whose\ncontent can be considered morally controversial; and (ii) questions\ninvolving trust. We begin with an analysis of (i).\n4.2 Legal Liability, a \u201cRight to Erasure,\u201d and Fake News in the Digital Era\n\n\nShould SECs be held accountable for directing users, even if\nunintentionally, to some Web sites whose content is either illegal or\nmorally controversial, or both? We should note that American SECs,\nincluding Google, claim that they provide only a service, and\nthus are not \u201ccontent providers.\u201d These companies believe\nthat it is not reasonable to hold them responsible/liable for the\ncontent on sites that they merely identify or provide links to in their\nlists of search returns. They also correctly point out that in the\nU.S., providers of online services \u2013 including major ISPs like\nVerizon and Comcast \u2013 are not held legally liable for the online\ncontent accessible through their services, provided they comply with\nofficial legal requests to remove content that explicitly violate U.S.\nlaws. Analogously, SECs believe that if they comply with official legal\nrequests to \u201cde-index,\u201d or remove links to, sites that\nwillingly and intentionally violate U.S. laws \u2013 e.g., laws\nviolating copyright, child pornography, and so forth \u2013 they too\nshould not be held legally liable for any content that users happen to\naccess via their services. However, many American-owned SECs operate\ninternationally, where laws and regulatory schemes differ from those in\nthe U.S. (as we saw in the case of Google in China).\n\n\nIt is worth noting that in Europe, SECs are viewed as\n\u201ccontrollers of personal data,\u201d as opposed to mere\nproviders of a service (see, for example, Google Spain SL, Google\nInc. 2013); as such, these companies, as well as ISPs that operate in\nEU countries, can be held responsible/liable for the content that is\naccessible through their services. One major difference regarding how\nSECs are viewed in the U.S. versus Europe came to the fore in the\nrelatively recent debate about whether users should have the\n\u201cRight to Be Forgotten,\u201d now commonly referred to as the\nRight to Erasure.\n4.2.1 The Right to Erasure (RtE)\n\n\nWhat is RtE, and why has it been controversial from the point of view\nof moral accountability issues for SECs? We can trace the origin of\nwhat eventually became the RtE debate to 2010, when Mario Costeja\nGonz\u00e1lez requested that Google remove a link included in its\nlist of returns for online searches of his name (see, for example,\nGoogle Spain SL, Google Inc. 2014). The link in question was to an\narticle in a Spanish newspaper (La Vanguardia) about a home\nforeclosure that occurred 16 years earlier. Gonz\u00e1lez, a Spanish\ncitizen, petitioned Spain\u2019s National Data Protection Agency, to\nhave the link removed. He argued that the information about his\nforeclosure, which was still prominently displayed in Google\u2019s\nlist of search returns for \u201cMario Gonz\u00e1lez,\u201d was no\nlonger \u201crelevant.\u201d Although the Spanish court ruled in\nGonz\u00e1lez\u2019s favor in 2010, many critics were unsure that\nthis court\u2019s ruling would also hold in other EU countries. So,\nthese critics were not surprised when Google appealed the Spanish\ncourt\u2019s ruling.\n\n\nAs the debate in Europe escalated, many RtE advocates argued that\nthe (former) EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC),\nwhich protects the privacy rights citizens of all EU countries,\nincludes language that indirectly supported RtE. For example, they\nnoted that Article 12 (\u201cRight of Access\u201d) of that directive\ngrants \u201cthe rectification, erasure, or blocking of data the\nprocessing of which does not comply with the provisions of the\nDirective because the information is\u2026inaccurate\u201d (see the\nEuropean Commission\u2019s \u201cFact Sheet on \u2018The Right to Be\nForgotten\u2019 Ruling\u201d). So, citizens of EU countries already\nhad an explicit legal right to have inaccurate personal\ninformation about them removed/erased from the Internet, or at least\nde-linked or de-indexed from search engines. Some RtE supporters also\nbelieved that Article 12 could be interpreted to imply a right to the\nerasure/de-linking of online personal information that is no longer\ndeemed to be relevant.\n\n\nSECs and other RtE opponents, including publishers and journalists,\nhave viewed RtE from a very different perspective. They argued that\nRtE would censor information, thereby limiting freedom of expression,\nand would degrade the overall quality of the Internet by limiting the\namount of online information available to users (see, for example,\nTavani 2018). Because of these and related concerns, they concluded\nthat the public would be\nharmed by RtE. However, some RtE supporters, including Bottis\n(2014, 2), suggested that RtE-related data protection was needed\nprecisely because it would help to eliminate harm \u2013 viz.,\n\u201cpsychological harm\u201d (and possibly even physical harm in\nsome cases) \u2013 that users might otherwise experience. Consider,\nfor example, that victims of \u201crevenge porn\u201d sites would\nhave explicit legal recourse regarding their requests to\nremove/de-index links that associated their names with those\ncontroversial sites (see the account of revenge porn vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe Right to Be Forgotten, now RtE, in Kritikos 2018).\n\n\nIn 2012, the European Commission (EC) proposed a revised\nData-Protection Regulation (Article 17) for the (former) EU Directive,\nwhich included specific provisions for the removal (i.e., the\n\u201crectification, erasure, or blocking\u201d) of personal data\nthat was irrelevant (as well as personal data that was\n\u201cinaccurate,\u201d \u201cinadequate,\u201d or\n\u201cexcessive\u201d). The EU Parliament approved the EC\u2019s\nrecommendations in 2013, after making a few minor modifications to\nArticle 17 and renaming the \u201cright\u201d in question the\n\u201cRight to Erasure.\u201d Perhaps not surprisingly, the newly\nrevised RtE regulation was challenged by Google and other corporations\noperating in Europe. However, in May 2014, the Court of Justice of the\nEuropean Union (CJEU) upheld the Spanish court\u2019s (2010) ruling in\nthe Gonz\u00e1lez case, also confirming Article 17 of the updated EU\nDirective on Data Protection. The high court\u2019s ruling confirmed\nthat citizens residing in all EU nations have the right, under certain\nconditions, to request that search engine operators remove links to\nsome kinds of personal information about them that are \u201cno longer\nrelevant.\u201d The CJEU also noted, however, that RtE is not an\nabsolute right; for example, this right would have to be balanced\nagainst other rights, including \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d\n(see the EU\u2019s \u201cFact Sheet on the \u2018Right to Be\nForgotten\u2019 Ruling\u201d).\n\n\nAlthough Google announced that it would comply with the CJEU\u2019s\nruling, it also worried that it would not be able to respond to all of\nthe users\u2019 requests that it would likely receive to\nremove/de-index links; doing so, it suggested, would not only be an\nonerous task but might also be a practical impossibility. Kelion (2019)\nnotes that in the time period between the CJEU\u2019s May 2014 ruling\nand September 2019, Google had received \u201cmore than 845,000\nrequests to remove a total of 3.3 million web addresses,\u201d which\nresulted in approximately \u201c45% of the links ultimately getting\ndelisted.\u201d So it would seem that Google and its supporters indeed\nhave a reasonable concern, given the magnitude of removal requests it\nhas received. But one can still reasonably ask, as Bottis has, whether\nthe sheer volume of these requests constitutes sufficient grounds for\nrepealing RtE.\n\n\nBottis points out we do not cease to enact and to comply with laws\nthat apply in physical space simply because their enforcement could not\npossibly eliminate crimes such as prostitution, drug dealing, etc. She\nfurther notes that in the digital world, protecting privacy and\ncopyright has sometimes seemed impossible to achieve, but we still\npropose, enact, and enforce laws to protect both as best we can. So on\nthis view, we could not justify \u201cde-legislating\u201d RtE solely\non the grounds that it is difficult to enforce. But it is also worth\nnoting that as in the case of Google\u2019s arguments for repealing\nRtE, many of the arguments advanced by RtE\u2019s supporters also\ninclude one or more logical fallacies; an analysis of some of those\nfallacious arguments is included in Tavani (2018).\n\n\nIn one sense, the debate about RtE (formerly referred to as the RTBF\ndebate) would now seem moot, in Europe at least, following the\nCJEU\u2019s 2014 ruling and its later approval of the General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR), which was adopted by the EU in April 2016\nand went into effect in May 2018. Yet, a new and different kind of\ndebate concerning RtE has since replaced the original \u2013 viz., a\ndispute about (i) how RtE should be implemented in the EU, especially\nin light of what some have criticized as the \u201cvague\u201d\nguidelines given to SECs; and (ii) whether RtE needs to be universally\napplied to be effective. With respect to (i), Google and other SECs\nclaimed that the CJEU did not provide sufficiently clear and precise\ncriteria for guiding them in determining which requests for\nremoval/deletion merit serious consideration and which do not. So,\nGoogle and other SECs continue to examine RtE requests on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n\n\nRegarding (ii), many privacy advocates argue that while RtE applies\nin all EU countries, it cannot be an effective law without strong\ninternational support; so, many members of the EC, as well as the\nprivacy regulators in the 28 EU nations (including the UK which will\nsoon exit the EU but will likely continue to support the principles\ncomprising RtE), have argued that RtE should apply beyond Europe. Even\nthough SECs operating in Europe are required to comply with GDPR (and\nits RtE provisions) in all EU countries, RtE can be very easily\ncircumvented both within and outside Europe. For example, a European\nuser who enters the keyword \u201cMario Gonz\u00e1lez\u201d on\nGoogle.com (or on non-local (European) versions of Bing, Yahoo,\nDuckDuckGo, etc.) will still find the link to the story about that\nperson\u2019s home foreclosure prominently listed, even though users\nof Google.es (in Spain), or Google users in other EU countries such as\nGermany (Google.de), will not see that link in their list of search\nreturns. So RtE supporters have petitioned for broader application of\nthe new law, while Google and other SECs have challenged that view in\ncourt. In September 2019, the EU\u2019s highest court ruled that\nGoogle did not have to apply RtE globally (Kelion 2019). So, many\nprivacy advocates in Europe and elsewhere believe that a universal or\nglobal version of RtE is still needed for it to be an effective\nlaw (see, for example, Global Partners Digital 2018).\n4.2.2 The Challenge of Fake News in the Digital Era\n\n\nNot only are SECs now required to comply with requests (from European\ncitizens living in EU countries) to de-index and remove links to\npersonal data that is deemed to be \u201cirrelevant,\u201d they\ncurrently face a somewhat similar challenge with respect to what to do\nabout indexing and providing links to false and/or misleading\ninformation included in online forums. This is especially apparent in\nthe case of Fake News (FN). What is FN, and why is it a challenge for\nSECs? Although there is no single, universally agreed upon definition\nof FN, it is generally understood to mean \u201cfabricated\nnews,\u201d \u201cfalse news stories,\u201d and so forth. According\nto the Cambridge English Dictionary, FN is defined as\n\u201cfalse stories that appear to be news, spread on the internet or\nother media, usually created to influence political views\u201d (see\nthe link in Other Internet Resources).  The prevalence of FN in online\nforums, and especially on social media sites and blogs, raises\nquestions about whether SECs are complicit in furthering the\ndissemination of this false information.\n\n\nIn the U.S., concerns about FN received considerable media attention\nfollowing the 2016 presidential election, when it was reported that\nactors in nations outside the US were deliberately posting false and\nmisleading information on social media sites such as Facebook to\ninfluence the outcome of the election against then-candidate Hilary\nClinton. In one sense, it would seem that the specific details of this\ncontroversy affect mainly, or possibly even solely, social media sites\nsuch as Facebook and Twitter as well as blogs, but not necessarily\nSECs. But we can also question whether SECs might share some\nresponsibility for exacerbating concerns about FN by providing users\nwith search results that \u2013 even if unintentionally \u2013 link\nto various FN stories included on social media sites and elsewhere on\nthe Internet.\n\n\nOne might be inclined to argue that since FN deliberately promotes\nerroneous and inaccurate information as truthful content, it should be\nmore closely regulated by governmental agencies. But as Lipinski\n(2018, 69) points out, \u201cwhile all Fake News possesses an element\nof untruth, not all Fake News is defamatory.\u201d He goes on to note\nthat in the U.S., the purveyor of non-defamatory FN is protected by\nthe First Amendment; so there is no legal recourse against the\n\u201cspeaker\u201d of non-defamatory FN or against the media\noutlets that post it. Thus, Lipinski\u2019s description of the law\ncould be interpreted to suggest that SECs, along with social media\nsites, should be exonerated from any legal liability when it comes to\nthe dissemination of FN. Yet, even if social media sites continue to\npermit the posting of FN on their platforms, we can still ask whether\nSECs might be held to a higher standard, given their privileged role\nas gatekeepers of knowledge on the Web to ensure that search engine\nusers users are directed to information that is\n\u201caccurate\u201d.  \n\n\nShould SECs be responsible for de-indexing links that happen to direct\ntheir users to some of the original sources of FN posts. An SEC, in\nits defense, could argue that it would be unfair to be held\nresponsible for pointing users to information that is legal and that\nis already freely available on the Internet. However, a critic might\nrespond that SECs operating in Europe have already agreed \u2013\nalbeit under the threat of law \u2013 to remove links to information\nthat has been deemed \u201cirrelevant,\u201d even though that\ninformation\u2019s content is truthful. So, a\nfortiori, the critic might ask: why shouldn\u2019t those\ncompanies also be required to remove links to information that is\nblatantly false and/or deliberately misleading? Perhaps the EU\ncountries \u2013 building on the rationale used in RtE (and also\nincluded in the broader GDPR) for allowing the erasure of personal\ninformation that is \u201cinaccurate,\u201d as well as no longer\n\u201crelevant\u201d \u2013 will take the lead in the future in\nrequiring SECs to respond to requests to remove links to at least some\nkinds of FN.\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that some major SECs have codes of ethics or\ncodes of conduct containing specific principles that can be\ninterpreted as conflicting with practices that contribute to or\nperpetuate the dissemination of FN, or any kind of information that\nhas been shown to be false or misleading. For example, Google\u2019s\nCode of Conduct (see link in Other Internet Resources), Section I\n(titled \u201cServe Our Users\u201d) states that because Google\ndelivers \u201cgreat products and services,\u201d it holds itself to\n\u201ca higher standard.\u201d And in Section I.1 (titled\n\u201cIntegrity\u201d), the Google Code states:\n\nOur reputation as a company that our users can trust is our most\nvaluable asset, and it is up to all of us to make sure that we\ncontinually earn that trust. All of our communications and other\ninteractions with our users should increase their trust in us.\n\n\n\nDoes Google\u2019s commitment to hold itself to a higher standard\n\u2013 i.e., to more than what is legally required of that corporation\nin a minimalist sense \u2013 imply that it has an obligation to avoid\ndirecting its users to sites that traffic in FN? And if Google is seen\nas enabling increased access to false and misleading information, could\nthat lead to an erosion of the \u201ctrust\u201d that this SEC now\nseems to enjoy? In its code of conduct, Google claims that it strives\n\u201ccontinually\u201d to \u201cearn\u201d the trust of its users.\nBut in an era of FN, we can wonder whether the sense of trust that\nGoogle, or any other major SEC, seeks to increase might instead begin to erode.\n\n\nIn Section 4.3 we further examine the concept of trust in the\ncontext of SECs. First, however, we conclude this section by noting\nthat as of this date, no clear and explicit policies have been adopted\nby major SECs regarding FN. In fact, there is no evidence to suggest\nthat SECs even see themselves as bearing any level of responsibility\nfor the rapid spread of FN. Many SECs would likely argue that if any\nentity ought to be held responsible for the widespread FN on the\nInternet, it should be the social media sites and the blogs on which\nmost of that misinformation is originally posted. Unfortunately,\nhowever, an adequate analysis of the role of social media sites and\ntheir specific responsibility in the FN controversy is beyond the scope\nof this entry; for more information about ethical issues affecting\nsocial media sites per se, see Vallor (2016).\n4.3 Some Questions Affecting Trust\n\n\nIn the preceding section, we saw how the rapid spread of Fake News\nonline raises one kind of trust-related concern for SECs: the accuracy\nof the information on some sites to which search engine users are\ndirected. We next briefly examine the concept of trust in more general\nterms, before considering whether and how it might be possible for\nusers to enter into trust relationships with SECs. As in the case of\nother key ethical issues affecting SECs, it is not possible to discuss\nhere the many aspects of trust in the detail that they would otherwise\nwarrant. For an excellent overview of trust (in general), see McLeod\n(2015). We limit our analysis to some current trust-related issues\ninvolving SECs, and suggest that the way SECs respond to these issues\ncould affect the sense of trust that users will have in the future for\nmajor SECs such as Google and Bing.\n\n\nWhat is trust, and why is it so important in the context of SECs?\nFollowing Baier (1986), many philosophers view trust as an\n\u201cattitude,\u201d while others see trust either in\n\u201crelational terms\u201d (Robbins 2016) or as a kind of\n\u201cexpectation\u201d (Walker 2006). And as Govier (1997, 35)\nnotes, one reason why trust is important is because \u201cattitudes of\ntrust and distrust affect the nature and quality of our social\nreality.\u201d When discussing the topic of trust, it is important to\nmake some key distinctions at the outset. For example, we need to\ndifferentiate trust from trustworthiness, which is often viewed either\nas a property of the trustee (rather than as an attitude of\nthe trustor) or a relation between trustor and trustee.\nAdditionally, it is important to distinguish between ethical\ntrust and epistemic trust (both of which are described below),\nin the context of SECs.\n\n\nAre contemporary SECs trustworthy organizations? If so, why is it\nthat we claim to trust them? Is it because (a) we perceive them as a\nreliable resource for directing us to the most relevant and\naccurate online information, in response to our search queries (i.e.,\nepistemic trust)? Or is it because (b) SEC\u2019s policies regarding\nwhat they do with our personal information, once collected, are\nperceived as transparent and fair (ethical trust)? Or is it\nbecause of both (a) and (b)? We can also ask whether there might be\nsome alternative/additional reasons why one could claim to trust or\ndistrust an SEC.\n\n\nOf course, one could reasonably question whether it is possible for\nhumans to enter into a trust relationship with an SEC, as a corporate\nentity, or even with a non-human entity of any kind. For example, some might assume\nthat a genuine trust relationship can only exist between humans\n(or perhaps more specifically, between \u201chuman agents\u201d). Others,\nhowever, believe that trust relationships can be extended to include\nsome non-human, or \u201cartificial,\u201d agents\u2014i.e., not\nonly corporations, which are sometimes viewed as aggregates of human\nagents, but also artificial electronic agents such as\n\u201cbots.\u201d Because issues affecting trust and responsibility\nfor SECs are distributed over a vast and diffuse network, many diverse\nkinds of agents can be involved\u2014e.g., from corporate CEOs and\nexecutives/boards, to customer-service representatives, to engineers\nand software developers, to the many (non-human) artificial (AI) agents\nor bots that can also \u201cmake some limited decisions\u201d on\nbehalf of an SEC. So what, exactly, is it that we trust/distrust when\nwe say we trust/distrust an SEC? In claiming to trust Google, for\nexample, we may, in effect, be saying that we trust all of the\ncomponent elements comprising that SEC.\n\n\nOne model that can help us to think about trust in contexts as vast\nand complex as major SECs is Margaret Urban Walker\u2019s framework of\n\u201cdiffuse default trust\u201d (Walker 2006). In Walker\u2019s\nscheme, trust relationships occur in environments (i.e., \u201cspaces\nand circumstances\u201d) that she calls \u201czones of default\ntrust.\u201d Walker differentiates trust from mere reliance by noting\nthat in a trust relationship between A and B, A not only expects B to\ndo X, but A expects it of B (Walker, 79). And because trust\n\u201clinks reliance to responsibility,\u201d Walker (p. 80) believes\nthat A has a \u201cnormative expectation\u201d of B. But she also\nnotes that we are not always conscious of these normative expectations,\nbecause they are typically \u201cunreflective and often\nnonspecific\u201d expectations where \u201cstrangers or unknown\nothers may be relied upon to behave in acceptable ways.\u201d Our\nreliance on the \u201cgood and tolerable behavior of others\u201d is\nat the core of Walker\u2019s notion of \u201cdefault trust\u201d (p.\n85).\n\n\nAn important feature of Walker\u2019s framework is that it allows\nfor trust relations between individuals who have not met, and who will\npossibly never meet, in person. And in her scheme, trust relationships\ncan occur not only between humans who are unknown to one another, but\nalso between humans and non-human entities such as corporations. Walker\nillustrates the latter point in an example where someone encounters\nparticularly bad service on an airplane operated by a major commercial\nairline. She points out that when we have such an experience of bad\nservice, it is appropriate to feel resentment, not necessarily toward\nspecific individuals who work for the airline, but toward the airline\nitself. So the entities comprising a zone of trust need not be limited\nto known (human) individuals.\n\n\nWalker (p. 85) extends her notion of default trust to include zones\nof \u201cdiffuse default trust,\u201d as also illustrated in her\nexample involving the major airline corporation. Consider the many ways\nthat responsibility can become \u201cdiffuse\u201d when distributed\nover a vast zone of trust such as a commercial airline (Walker), or a\nmajor SEC like Google which also qualifies as a zone of diffuse-default\ntrust comprising a diverse range of agents (both human and non-human).\nAmong the non-human entities in that zone are artificial electronic\nagents (bots) who \u201coperate behind the scenes,\u201d both with\nhumans and other artificial agents. The latter kinds of entities also\ninclude multi-agent systems that can \u201cact\u201d in limited ways\non behalf of an SEC. For a detailed description of how Walker\u2019s\nmodel can be applied in digital contexts, including zones of diffuse\ndefault trust comprising both humans and multi-agent systems, see the\nanalysis in Buechner and Tavani (2011).\n\n\nAs noted above, it is important to distinguish between epistemic\ntrust and ethical trust, both of which are essential for trusting SECs.\nWhereas concerns regarding the former sense of trust overlap with\nissues affecting an SEC\u2019s reliability, as well as with the\naccuracy of information contained on the Web sites it indexes and links\nto, ethical trust in the case of SECs can overlap with\nquestions/concerns pertaining to a search organization\u2019s user\npolicies and whether those policies are open, fair, and trustworthy.\nRecognizing and complying with the requirements of both aspects of\ntrust is crucial for an SEC like Google to realize a key objective\nstated in its code of conduct\u2014viz., to \u201cincrease\u201d and\n\u201ccontinually earn\u2026trust\u201d with its users (The Google\nCode of Conduct, 2018).\n\n\nWe conclude this section by acknowledging that much more could be\nsaid about the important role that trust plays in the context of SECs.\nBut we have at least identified some of the reasons why trust is very\nimportant for SECs and also showed how those companies can qualify as\n\u201czones of diffuse default trust\u201d (Walker). Although we have\nexamined only one model of trust \u2013 Walker\u2019s framework\n\u2013 in analyzing some of the many dimensions of trust affecting\nSECs, we have not argued that Walker\u2019s is the only, or even the\nbest, theory for understanding trust issues affecting SECs. Nor have we\nargued that Walker\u2019s theory is without internal problems.\nInstead, we put aside those kinds of questions in favor of using a\nspecific model to analyze trust-related questions affecting SECs in a\nsystematic way.\n\n\nWe began Section 4 by asking whether SECs have any special moral\nobligations because of their \u201cprivileged place\u201d in society\n(i.e., in light of their role as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of knowledge\non the Web), and in Section 4.1 we examined Hinman\u2019s concern about \nthe kind of control of knowledge that SECs currently have. In Section 4.2, we\nidentified a relatively recent trust-related challenge that SECs now\nface because of the proliferation of Fake News on the Web. And based on\nour further analysis of trust in Section 4.3, it would seem that an\nSEC\u2019s ability to establish and maintain trust with its users\nwill be crucial for that organization to thrive in the future.\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nIn this entry, we have seen how various ethical issues arose during\nkey developmental stages of search technology that eventually led to\ncontemporary \u201cWeb 2.0-era search engines.\u201d Search\ntechnology itself has evolved over the past 75 years\u2014i.e., from\npre-computer-based techniques (such as memex) intended to help\nscientists and professional researchers locate and retrieve important\ninformation in a timely manner, to an Internet-based technology that\nassisted ordinary users in locating (and linking directly to) relevant\nWeb sites in response to their manifold search queries, to a highly\nsophisticated technology that, in its current form, has become\nincreasingly commodified and personalized to the point that it might\nnow be regarded as a threat to some of our basic freedoms and\ndemocratic ideals.\n\n\nThe ethical issues examined in this entry are\nmainly from a deontological perspective, thus reflecting the published\nwork on this topic to date. However, in no way is our analysis of\nethical issues affecting search engines intended to be exhaustive;\nrather it merely reflects the standard or \u201cmainstream\u201d\napproach that applied ethicists and other scholars have taken thus far\nin their analyses of search engine controversies. One could easily\nimagine questions arising from other ethical perspectives as\nwell. From the vantage point of social justice, for example, one could\nreasonably ask whether search engine companies in the U.S. and other\ndeveloped nations are morally obligated to help bridge the\n\u201cinformation divide\u201d by providing easier and more\nubiquitous access (via search technologies) to users in developing\nnations, especially to non-English speaking users. Also, from a\nutilitarian or consequentialist perspective, one might ask whether the\noverall social consequences would be more beneficial if search engine\nusers were legally permitted to retrieve some forms of proprietary\ninformation (e.g. proprietary online information concerning health and\npublic-health studies that were made possible by tax-payer funding)\nfor personal use.\n\nAdditionally, some alternative ethical frameworks could also be used\nin analyzing ethical issues affecting search engines. These include,\nbut are not limited to, Hans Jonas\u2019 \u201cImperative of\nResponsibility\u201d (Jonas 1984), Bernard Gert\u2019s \u201cCommon\nMorality\u201d (Gert 2007), and John Rawls\u2019 \u201cjustice as\nfairness\u201d (Rawls 1999). For a very brief description of how\nethical aspects of search engines might also be approached from the\nperspectives of \u201crights,\u201d \u201cfairness,\u201d\n\u201ccommon good\u201d and \u201cvirtue,\u201d see the Markkula\nCenter for Applied Ethics (in the Other Internet Resources).\n\n\nEven though the primary focus has been on identifying and analyzing\nethical issues affecting search engines, in closing it is\nworth reiterating a point made in the introductory section\u2014viz.,\nthat search engine technology also has implications for some\nother kinds of philosophical issues. This is especially apparent in the\narea of epistemology, where some critics raise concerns related to our\nreceived notions of the nature and justification of knowledge claims,\nin an era of widespread use and dependence on search engines. For\nexample, Hinman (2008, 75) argues that search engines\n\u201ccontribute significantly to the social construction of\nknowledge\u201d\u2014i.e., not only do they provide access to\nknowledge, but they also increasingly \u201cplay a crucial role in\nthe constitution of knowledge itself.\u201d An analysis of this claim, however, as well as\nother epistemological and (broader) philosophical aspects of search engines, is beyond\nthe scope of the present entry.",
