    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Proofs of God\u2019s Existence\n5.1 Proofs of God\u2019s Existence\n\nWodeham\u2019s approach to philosophical theology begins with a\ntraditional attempt to determine whether or not God\u2019s existence\ncan be philosophically and demonstratively proved.\n\nIn both the Lectura secunda and the Ordinatio his\nstrategy is structured by two proofs. The first is taken from and\nexplicitly attributed to Scotus. Of the Scotist proof, Wodeham remarks\nthat it seems very persuasive and more evident than any reason that\ncan be brought against it. The second argument appears to be original\nto Wodeham.\n\nThe first proof taken from John Duns Scotus is found both in his\nOrdinatio and De Primo Principio. The argument\nfollows from an initial disjunctive premise: there is either some\nfirst uncaused cause or there is not. If the former, Scotus and\nWodeham argue that it is obvious that this is God. If the latter is\nchosen then unacceptable consequences follow. The most notable is that\nthere would be an infinite series of caused causes without a\nterminating point. Two reasons are offered for why such an infinite\nseries is impossible. The first is that, the whole of all\n\u201cessentially ordered\u201d causes must have a cause, but if the\ncause of this multitude comes from the totality of caused causes, then\nthis cause will be the cause of itself, which is impossible. The\nsecond reason that an infinite series of causes will not work is this\nwould require that there are an infinite amount of causes acting at\nthe same time. This requirement is built into Wodeham\u2019s (and\nScotus\u2019s) conception of essentially ordered causes\u2014which\nWodeham later sharply distinguishes from a series of accidentally\nordered causes.\n\nWodeham offers a second proof for the existence of God. Regarding this\nproof he states that it is sufficient to incline the intellect to\nassent, but he also acknowledges that it is still able to be doubted\nby \u201cshameful adversaries\u201d (LS II:121; OO I, d. 2, a. 1).\nAccording to Wodeham\u2019s description of different types of\nevidence, it is clear that this \u201cproof\u201d is not able to\ncompel a truly evident judgment because the proof remains open to\ndoubt and thus only reaches the second degree of evidence.\n\nThe proof begins from another disjunctive proposition inspired by\nAnselm\u2019s Proslogion. Either there is some most noble\nbeing about which no more noble thing is able to be thought, or there\nis no such most noble thing. Wodeham remarks that one possible\nconsequence that might follow is that there would be an infinite\nsuccession of more noble things, thus permitting an infinity of\nbeings. This conclusion, he says, is unpleasant to the mind; that is,\nthe intellect is not able to admit an infinity of beings without\n\u201cgrumbling\u201d (murmere). For this option at least,\nit is clear that the intellect can incline us to assent that God\nexists, but it is still possible to doubt it, which is the\ndistinguishing mark of the second degree of evidence. The other\nalternative is that there must be some most noble thing actually\nexisting (in actu existens), even though this is not the most\nnoble thing possible. Wodeham finds this alternative opposed by the\nmost evident of reasons\u2014something akin to Anselm\u2019s\nontological argument: whatever is actually existing (existens in\nactu) is de facto more noble than what is not in\nexistence. Thus, it is nonsensical to speak of something more noble,\nwhich is only potentially existing (LS II:121, ll.13\u201315).\n",
