    "main_text": "Theoretical Structure of Buddhist Ethics\n3. Theoretical Structure of Buddhist Ethics\n\nBuddhist texts don\u2019t often take up the question of the general\ntheoretical principles that differentiate between good and bad, or\nright and wrong; they more often tend to lay down a variety of\nparticular moral rules, guidelines, virtues, and vices, and leave the\nmatter there. But when the texts do address what differentiates right\nfrom wrong in general, they tend to focus on the consequences of our\ndecisions and actions. Take, for instance, this passage from the\nAdvice to R\u0101hula at Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101:\n\nWhen you reflect, if you know: \u2018This action that I wish to do\nwith the body would lead to my own affliction, or to the affliction of\nothers, or to the affliction of both; it is an unwholesome bodily\naction with painful consequences, with painful results,\u2019 then\nyou definitely should not do such an action with the body. But when\nyou reflect, if you know: \u2018This action that I wish to do with\nthe body would not lead to my own affliction, or to the affliction of\nothers, or to the affliction of both; it is a wholesome bodily action\nwith pleasant consequences, with pleasant results,\u2019 then you may\ndo such an action with the body. (\u00d1\u0101namoli and Bodhi\ntrans. 1995, 524\u201325)\n\n\nThis passage identifies the criterion of permissible action in terms\nof consequences, and in particular, consequences that consist of\nhappiness and suffering. Passages such as this one suggest the\npossibility of regarding Therav\u0101da ethics as having a\nconsequentialist foundation.\n\nMost Buddhist authors don\u2019t say enough about the overall\nstructure of their normative commitments to make it possible to\nattribute any particular ethical theory to them. One exception would\nbe \u015a\u0101ntideva (late 7th-mid 8th century CE), whose writings\ncontain a number of passages of great interest from the perspective of\nethical theory. Perhaps the most revealing of these can be found in\nthe Training Anthology\n(\u015aik\u1e63\u0101-samuccaya) at standard page 15 (see\nGoodman 2016a, 17). The passage reads:\n\nIf a bodhisattva does not make a sincere, unwavering effort in\nthought, word, and deed to stop all the present and future pain and\nsuffering of all sentient beings, and to bring about all present and\nfuture pleasure and happiness, or does not seek the collection of\nconditions for that, or does not strive to prevent what is opposed to\nthat, or does not bring about small pain and suffering as a way of\npreventing great pain and suffering, or does not abandon a small\nbenefit in order to accomplish a greater benefit, if he neglects to do\nthese things even for a moment, he undergoes a downfall.\n\n\nHere \u015a\u0101ntideva focuses our attention on the future\nconsequences that our actions can causally \u201cstop\u201d or\n\u201cbring about\u201d; at least in this passage, he seems to be\nadvocating consequentialism. In particular, what \u015a\u0101ntideva\nis concerned with here is the experienced quality of certain feelings;\nhe is trying to stop \u201cpain and suffering\u201d and bring about\n\u201cpleasure and happiness.\u201d Philosophers use the term\n\u201chedonism\u201d to refer to the view that takes the presence of\nhappiness and the absence of suffering to constitute well-being.\nMoreover, the view \u015a\u0101ntideva advocates is universalist,\nbecause it extends moral concern to all sentient beings. It\u2019s\nfairly clear, moreover, that \u015a\u0101ntideva is an advocate of\nmaximization: he regards it as mandatory to bring about a small amount\nof suffering to prevent a greater amount, and to sacrifice a small\namount of happiness to achieve a larger amount. And since he does not\nsay anything about constraints or important considerations arising\nfrom the distribution of happiness and suffering, the most plausible\nreading of this passage would involve accepting aggregation, in which\nthe happiness and suffering of all beings are considered together,\nwithout attaching significance to how these are distributed. Now the\nethical view called \u201cclassical utilitarianism\u201d can be\ndefined as aggregative, maximizing, universalist, hedonist\nconsequentialism. This passage, then, can most naturally be\ninterpreted as a statement of the classical utilitarian form of\nconsequentialism.\n\nThough this passage gives us strong reasons to accept that\n\u015a\u0101ntideva is committed to assigning impartial benevolence a\ncentral role in how we should live and behave toward others, a number\nof scholars have questioned whether we have enough evidence to\ninterpret him as a utilitarian (e.g., Harris 2015). And as Michael\nBarnhart and others have argued, even if \u015a\u0101ntideva himself\nactually was a utilitarian, it does not follow that such a view can be\nattributed to the Buddhist tradition as a whole (Barnhart 2012,\n19).\n\nAccording to many of the world\u2019s intellectual traditions, each\nperson is a real, individual substance with a true essence or self.\nAccording to Buddhism, this widely held view is false; you are not a\nsubstance. Instead, all there is to a person is a complex, rapidly\nchanging stream of mental and physical phenomena, connected by causal\nlinks and inextricably interrelated with the rest of the universe.\nThis view is known as the doctrine of no self (P\u0101li\nanatt\u0101; Skt. an\u0101tman.) \u015a\u0101ntideva\ndraws on this teaching to argue that egoism is irrational, and that we\nshould work for the benefit of all sentient beings. As he writes,\n\u201cWithout exception, no sufferings belong to anyone. They are to\nbe warded off simply because they are suffering. Why is any limitation\nput on this?\u201d (Crosby and Skilton trans. 1995, 97) If you are\nnot a real thing, there is no reason to place any greater intrinsic\nimportance on preventing your own future suffering than on preventing\nthe future suffering of others. As writers such as Mark Siderits\n(2003, ch. 9) have often noted, this strategy for justifying altruism,\nwhich many scholars now call the Ownerless Suffering Argument, closely\nresembles the arguments for consequentialism in Parfit 1984 (ch. 15).\nIn fact, it\u2019s hard to see how the Ownerless Suffering Argument\ncould support any moral view that is not some form of universalist\nconsequentialism.\n\nFrom the perspective of this argument, your suffering has no greater\nsignificance than that of anyone else, but it also has no less. You\nare one of the many sentient beings whose welfare is to be promoted.\nMoreover, you may have more effective means available to advance your\nown happiness than you do to advance the happiness of others. And you\noften know much more about yourself than you do about others. So there\nis scope within this view to justify prudential concern for your own\nfuture; in the early and middle stages of the path, you may end up in\npractice spending more time taking care of your own future needs than\nthose of others. This kind of prudential concern is compatible with\nthe doctrine of no self, and is not the same as egoism. Here egoism\nwould mean attaching more intrinsic significance to your own welfare\nthan to that of others, or even disregarding others\u2019 welfare and\nmerely making an effort to promote your own. Buddhists would see\negoism as reflecting a damaging lack of perception of the absence of\nself.\n\nAny interpretation of Buddhist ethics must find room for the\nabsolutely crucial role of intention. There are many contexts in which\nBuddhism seems to emphasize the intention with which an act was\nperformed much more than the benefit or harm that actually resulted.\nOne case often cited is that of Channa, who presented a gift of food\nto the Buddha which gave him dysentery and thus caused his death.\nSince Channa\u2019s intention was to perform a meritorious act of\ngenerosity, the Buddha tells his followers not to condemn Channa;\nsince he did not know that the food was contaminated, he actually\ngained goodness from this action.\n\nLess dramatically, the amount of good or bad karma generated by an\naction is said to be strongly dependent on the motivation with which\nit was carried out. Thus actions performed out of hatred are more\nkarmically damaging than those performed out of greed. Meanwhile, some\nBuddhist texts seem to say that any action performed with good\nintentions is a good action, whereas any action performed with bad\nintentions is a bad one. These suggestions may support a theoretical\nreconstruction that focuses more on motivation than on\nconsequences.\n\nAs we will see in Section 6, most forms of Buddhism also take a\nstrongly negative attitude to killing. Sometimes, this opposition is\ntaken to an extent which may be difficult to justify from a\nconsequentialist perspective. Many consequentialist theories, such as\nclassical utilitarianism, notoriously make it much easier to justify\nkilling than it would be on other moral perspectives. The most\nstraightforward application of utilitarianism would imply that it is\nsometimes morally permissible to kill someone when doing so would\nbring about benefits or prevent harms sufficient to outweigh the value\nof the future existence that would otherwise be enjoyed by the person\nto be killed. Many Buddhists, especially in the Therav\u0101da, would\nrecoil from this implication and place a much higher standard on the\njustification of killing, if it can be justified at all. This issue\nposes a significant problem that a consequentialist interpretation\nneeds to solve.\n\nAnother way of understanding Buddhist ethics is to read it as similar,\nnot to consequentialism, but to virtue ethics. This account was first\nproposed by Damien Keown (in Keown 1992) and has since been followed\nby several scholars. The virtue ethics approach begins from the\nundoubted fact that Buddhist texts devote a great deal of attention to\nwhat kind of people we should strive to be and what virtues we should\nseek to cultivate in ourselves. In this respect, Buddhist ethics may\nseem more similar to the views of ancient Greek thinkers such as\nAristotle than to more modern Western thought. For Aristotle, the goal\nwe should aim at in life is eudaimonia, often translated\n\u201chappiness\u201d or \u201chuman flourishing.\u201d This\ncondition of eudaimonia is the good for humans. Keown argues\nthat the role of Nirvana in Therav\u0101da ethics is analogous:\nNirvana is the good. The various abilities and virtues that are\ncultivated on the Buddhist path would then derive their value from\ntheir relation to this good, either as means to attaining Nirvana or\nas constituent aspects of the awakened life.\n\nOne way to settle the issue between consequentialist and virtue ethics\ninterpretations of Buddhist teachings would be to identify the most\nfundamental aim of the Buddhist worldview. Is it the perfection of the\nindividual\u2019s character, as in virtue ethics, or the welfare of\nall sentient beings, as in universalist, welfarist\nconsequentialism?\n\nNow on a traditional Buddhist view, the Law of Karma says that those\nof our actions that are intended to harm others will evolve into\nmisery for us, whereas those of our actions that are intended to\nbenefit others will evolve into happiness for us. Moreover, the\nhighest states of well-being we can attain are also characterized by\nlovingkindness and compassion for others. In all or nearly all cases,\nthen, the action that is best for the agent and the action that is\nbest for all beings will coincide, on this view. There is no deep\nconflict between self-interest and morality.\n\nThis is wonderful, if true, but it makes our theoretical task much\nharder. Should we say that the most fundamental aim of Buddhist\npractice is to benefit all sentient beings everywhere and advance\ntheir welfare, and that it so happens that the most effective way for\neach agent to do this is to work toward her own awakening? Or should\nwe say that the most fundamental aim of practice is the\npractitioner\u2019s own awakening, and that it so happens that\npursuing this aim will turn out to benefit others as well?\n\nMah\u0101y\u0101na texts are full of passages that focus on the\nimportance of the welfare of all beings and extol those who promote\nthis goal. Therefore, the virtue ethics interpretation appears more\nplausible when applied to the Therav\u0101da than when applied to the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na. And in fact, Keown proposed his account primarily\nin relation to the Therav\u0101da; he offers a rather different\ninterpretation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na, which in fact involves a\ncertain kind of consequentialism. We should not necessarily assume\nthat all forms of Buddhism have the same structure at the level of\nethical theory.\n\nIt is possible to construct an interpretation that acknowledges the\ncentral importance of virtue and the cultivation of character in\nBuddhism within an overall framework that is consequentialist. One\napproach is character consequentialism, in which the good consequences\nthat are to be maximized are defined by the welfare of sentient\nbeings, and the welfare of sentient beings is understood to consist in\nboth happiness and virtue. On this view, we have a non-instrumental\nreason to promote the virtue of ourselves and others. (This theory is\ndefended at length in Goodman 2009.) Character consequentialism thus\nrejects hedonism, the view that identifies welfare with happiness, and\nadvances a theory in which the good has two major components. This\napproach allows us to avoid some of the damaging philosophical\nobjections that have been raised against hedonism. But it also creates\nquestions about how to compare the value of greater virtue against the\nvalue of greater happiness, should these considerations ever\nconflict.\n\nAnother approach is aretaic consequentialism, an indirect form of\nconsequentialism in which the primary objects of evaluation are\ncharacter traits, not actions or rules. This theory tells us to\ndevelop in ourselves those states of character which are conducive to\nthe happiness of sentient beings. (See Siderits 2007, 292\u201393)\nThis elegant interpretation explains why Buddhist texts so often focus\non character traits, but it also retains a hedonist view of\nwell-being. It allows us to interpret instructions on moral discipline\nnot as inflexible rules, but as advice about what traits of character\nto cultivate.\n\nHow plausible is it to interpret Buddhist authors as committed to a\nhedonist view of well-being\u2013\u2013or indeed, to any view of\nwell-being at all? South Asian Buddhist texts often use terms such as\nartha and hita that plausibly express the same\nconcept as our term \u201cwell-being,\u201d so it is reasonable to\nask what account the authors of those texts might have given of what\nthey meant. Given the central importance of the prevention of\nsuffering in Buddhism, as expressed in such teachings as the First\nNoble Truth, it must be true that well-being in Buddhism includes\nfreedom from suffering as, at least, one of its components. Meanwhile,\ngiven the strongly negative Buddhist view of desire, it would not be\nplausible at all to regard Buddhism as holding a desire-fulfillment\ntheory of well-being. \n\nHowever, hedonism is not our only interpretive option.\n\u015a\u0101ntideva claims in several passages that the Buddhist\nvirtues work together and reinforce each other. This makes it possible\nto read him as holding a \u201chomeostatic cluster\u201d view of\nwell-being like that of Richard Boyd (see Goodman 2016b, 149-152.)\nThose who defend the analogy between Buddhist ethics and Aristotelian\nvirtue ethics could advance a nature-fulfillment theory as the proper\ninterpretation of well-being in Buddhism. Mark Siderits (2007) rejects\nthis interpretation on the grounds that it conflicts with the doctrine\nof no self, which implies that, ultimately, humans have no nature to\nfulfill. But Christopher Gowans has pointed out that, if we regard\nwell-being as existing at the conventional level of truth, this\nobjection may lose its force (see Gowans 2015, 117). \n\nSome scholars, such as Charles Hallisey (1996) and Jay Garfield, have\nconcluded that it is futile and misleading to try to interpret\nBuddhist ethics as a systematic theory fitting into one of the\nrecognized types of ethical theories in the West. Rather, they suggest\nthat Buddhist ethics is pluralist, in that it draws on various kinds\nof moral considerations in different cases, and particularist,\nrejecting the entire enterprise of formulating general moral\nprinciples to cover all cases. This view can easily accommodate\ntextual evidence of various kinds of moral reasoning used by Buddhists\nin different situations. But since the resulting interpretation lacks\nan overarching structure, it has few theoretical resources to\nadjudicate conflicts between different values, and it may become quite\nunclear what the view says about particular difficult cases.\n\nBuddhist texts say relatively little about metaethics, and attempts to\nconstruct metaethical views that would be consistent with Buddhist\nphilosophical commitments have encountered many difficulties. One\nfascinating recent attempt to provide a metaethics for early Buddhism,\nin the work of Jake Davis (2016 and Forthcoming,) takes statements\nabout what the wise would approve or criticize as indicating the\nsource of ethical normativity. This kind of formulation is frequently\nencountered in canonical texts, as for instance in the Metta\nSutta: \u201cLet them not do the slightest thing that the wise\nwould later reprove.\u201d Buddhists accept that a mind that is calm,\nclear and stable sees the truth more accurately than disturbed,\nfluctuating ordinary consciousness. For Davis, the ethical truth just\nconsists of those normative statements that would be accepted\nunanimously by those whose inner life exhibits, to a sufficient\ndegree, these qualities of mental clarity and insight. Thus, on his\nview, even if the wise would often approve of taking actions that\nwould have valuable consequences, it is not those consequences but the\napproval of the wise that makes those actions morally right.\n\nThe theoretical structure of Buddhist ethics is a subject of\ncontinuing research and debate among a number of scholars, and further\ndevelopments are likely in our understanding of this field.\n",
