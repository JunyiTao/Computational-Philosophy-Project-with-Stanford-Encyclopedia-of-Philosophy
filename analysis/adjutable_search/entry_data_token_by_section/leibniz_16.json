    "main_text": "Metaphysics: Leibnizian Idealism || Monads and the World of Phenomena\n5.1 Monads and the World of Phenomena\n\n\nThus far we have seen that Leibniz rejected the Cartesian account of\nmatter, according to which matter, the essence of which is extension,\ncould be considered a substance. Leibniz held instead that only beings\nendowed with true unity and capable of action can count as substances.\nThe ultimate expression of Leibniz's view comes in his celebrated\ntheory of monads, in which the only beings that will count as genuine\nsubstances and hence be considered real are mind-like simple substances\nendowed with perception and appetite. What was said above concerning\nthe unity and activity of simple substance should suffice to explain\nLeibniz's reasons for holding such a position. Now a fuller\nversion of Leibniz's idealism must be presented.\n\n\nAccording to Leibniz, if the only genuinely real beings are\nmind-like simple substances, then bodies, motion, and everything else\nmust result from or be derivative of those simple substances and their\nperceptual states. In a typical statement of his idealism, Leibniz\nsays, \u201cI don't really eliminate body, but reduce\n[revoco] it to what it is. For I show that corporeal mass\n[massa], which is thought to have something over and above\nsimple substances, is not a substance, but a phenomenon resulting from\nsimple substances, which alone have unity and absolute reality\u201d\n(G II 275/AG 181). Yet, this position, denying the reality of bodies and\nasserting that monads are the grounds of all corporeal phenomena, as\nwell as its metaphysical corollaries has shocked many. Bertrand\nRussell, for example, famously remarked in the Preface to his book on\nLeibniz that he felt that \u201cthe Monadology was a kind of\nfantastic fairy tale, coherent perhaps, but wholly arbitrary.\u201d\nAnd, in perhaps the wittiest and most biting rhetorical question asked\nof Leibniz, Voltaire gibes, \u201cCan you really believe that a drop\nof urine is an infinity of monads, and that each of these has ideas,\nhowever obscure, of the universe as a whole?\u201d (Oeuvres\ncompl\u00e8tes, Vol. 22, p. 434) Well, if you are Leibniz, you\ncan. But how so?\n",
