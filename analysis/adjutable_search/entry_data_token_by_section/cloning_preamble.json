    "main_text": "\n\nDolly the sheep, the first mammal cloned from a somatic (body) cell,\ncame into the world innocent as a lamb. However, soon after the\nannouncement of her birth in February 1997 (Wilmut et al., 1997) she\ncaused panic and controversy. An important, and for many people\ntroubling question arose: if the cloning of sheep is possible, will\nscientists soon start cloning humans as well; and if they did, would\nthis be wrong or unwise?\n\nFor most people, Dolly was really a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\nShe represented a first undesirable and dangerous step to applying\nreproductive cloning in humans, something that many agreed should\nnever be done. Only a small minority thought it was permissible, or\neven morally obligatory to conduct further research into human\nreproductive cloning. Some had no strong objections to it, but did not\nsee any reason to promote it either.\n\nDolly is now stuffed and set up for display in the National Museum of\nScotland. Many countries or jurisdictions have legally banned human\ncloning or are in the process of doing so. In some countries,\nincluding France and Singapore, reproductive cloning of humans is a\ncriminal offence. In 2005, UNESCO adopted a \u2018Declaration on\nHuman Cloning\u2019, which calls for a universal ban on human cloning\n(for an examination of the human cloning debate at UNESCO since 2008,\nsee Langlois, 2017). The debate on human reproductive cloning seems to\nhave drawn to a close. However, since reproductive cloning of mammals\nhas become routine in several countries, there is reason to believe\nthat at some point in the future, humans will be cloned too. Moreover,\neven if reproductive cloning will not be possible in the near\nfuture, cloning for research and therapeutic purposes is likely to\nbe.\n\nThis entry describes the most important areas of disagreement\nregarding the ethics of cloning. I will focus on human cloning (as\nopposed to animal cloning), since human cloning has been the focus of\nthe cloning debate.\n",
