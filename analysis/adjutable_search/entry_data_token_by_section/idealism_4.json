    "main_text": "German Idealism\n5. German Idealism\n\nKant can thus be seen to have made two major points about\ntranscendental idealism. (1) Although he never questions the existence\nof something independent of our representations of it, he can claim to\nhave shown that when it comes to the ultimate constitution of this\nreality as it may be considered independently of the way it appears to\nbeings endowed with reason and (human) sensibility we can know nothing\non theoretical grounds; on practical grounds, as we have seen, he\ninsisted that we can rationally believe, for example, that we really\nare free. We neither can know whether\u2014to use a Hobbesian\nexpression again\u2014\u201cwithout us\u201d or\u2014to\nuse Kant\u2019s own term \u201cin itself\u201d\u2014there\nare material objects that consist of substances and their attributes\nstanding in spatio-temporal or other (e.g., causal) relations to each\nother and constituting a law-governed whole called nature. Nor can we\nknow whether whatever we experience as an object is in the end some\nmental product of a divine mind having creative powers totally\ndifferent from those of which we can make sense. Thus we are bound to\nbe agnostic with regard to any metaphysical theoretical claims as to\nthe real constitution of the world, and this implies that there is no\nway to convince us of either idealism or determinate realism about the\ncharacter of things in themselves. (2) However, whenever we talk about\nobjects of cognition, i.e., of objects that are addressed by us in\nterms of concepts and judgments, we have to accept them as being\nconceptual constructions based on our subjective forms of intuitions\nand on very specific conceptual rules for bringing together or\nunifying data: an object of cognition is that \u201cin whose\nconcept a manifold of what is given through sensibility is\nunited\u201d (Critique of Pure Reason, B 137). This means,\naccording to Kant, that the assumption of the conceptual constitution\nof objects of cognition is unavoidable. This is the part of his\nposition that Kant calls empirical realism.\n\nKant\u2019s Solomonic verdict was not much appreciated by the main\nrepresentatives of post-Kantian German idealism. Friedrich Heinrich\nJacobi, as already mentioned, immediately criticized Kant\u2019s\nallowance of things in themselves of unknown determinations, and\nreplaced it with a straightforward fideism about external existence\n(which he alleged to find in Hume\u2019s rejection of the\npsychological possibility of skepticism). However, the general\ntendency of the idealists, beginning with Johann Gottlieb Fichte, was\nto reject Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism by arguing that there\nis no real opposition between what is traditionally taken to be a\nsubject-independent world that is present to us in the mode of\n\u201cgivenness\u201d and \u201cbeing\u201d and a world that is\nconceived of as subject-dependent in that it is formed by conceptual\ntools or other \u201cthought-ingredients\u201d stemming from some\nsubjective activity or other. In other words, Kant\u2019s successors\nremoved his restriction of a necessary isomorphism between knowledge\nand the known to the case of appearances, and took it to be a general\nrelation between thought and being. This led to a new conception of\nidealism whose distinguishing character consists in the endorsement of\nthe claim of the \u201cinseparability of being and thinking\u201d\nwhere the term \u201cinseparability\u201d is meant to cover\nsometimes reciprocal dependence and sometimes strict identity. This\nconception was established primarily by epistemological considerations\nand realized by introducing entirely new ways of thinking about what\nultimately constitutes reality based on a dynamic conception of\nself-consciousness that the German idealists took to be at the heart\nof Kant\u2019s theory of the transcendental unity of apperception\n(and had been arrived at by Kant on the basis of\nepistemological, not: ontological, considerations!).\nAccording to this conception, reality has to be conceived as a result\nof an activity paradigmatically manifested in the unique manner in\nwhich consciousness of oneself arises. Reality is essentially mental,\nwhile the mental is essentially active. In order to find out the true\nnature of reality one has to gain insight into the operations of this\nactivity.\n\nThis approach to answering fundamental metaphysical questions by\ncasting into doubt the traditional distinction between ontology and\nepistemology not only leads to a different conception of what idealism\nis all about. Above all, it means that one has to sketch out the\ndifference between idealism and whatever is taken to be its opposite\n(realism, naturalism, materialism, sensualism etc.) not in terms of\ndifferent kinds of \u201cstuff\u201d either material or mental but\nto turn away from any \u201cmatter\u201d whatsoever. Rather,\nidealism is now defined in terms of the opposition between dynamic\nelements like activities and forces as the primary constituents of\nreality and more substantial items like material objects and\n(spiritual) persons. Idealism understood in this fashion becomes the\nname of a \u201cmetaphysical\u201d (in a non-traditional sense)\nworld-view that is opposed to what especially Fichte and Schelling\nliked to call \u201cdogmatism\u201d and is rooted in assumptions\nabout dynamic processes that are operative in the course of self- and\nobject-constitution. There is thus a fundamental difference between\nthe idealism of German idealism and the immaterialism of Berkeley:\nwhere Berkeley\u2019s idealism focused on ideas as the\n\u201cstuff\u201d of existence and assumed minds, whether human or\ndivine, as their repository, the German idealists focused on the mind\nas active and largely tried to suppress the traditional ontology of\nsubstances and their accidents within which Berkeley still worked,\nwhich Hume questioned but for which he supplied no alternative, and\nwhich Kant again defended by conceiving of substance and accident as\nrelational categories.\n\nAlthough overcoming the distinction between thought and being by\nrelying on self-relating activities might be seen as a common goal of\nall the major German idealistic thinkers, they pursued this project in\nvery different directions. The first post-Kantian philosopher who\nembarked explicitly on the project to elaborate a dynamic idealistic\nconception of reality that was based on what he took to be conditions\nof knowledge/cognition and agency and that was built on a specific\nconception of self-consciousness was Johann Gottlieb Fichte\n(1762\u20131814) while he was a professor at the university of\nSaxe-Weimar in Jena from 1794 to 1799. In his Doctrine of\nScience (1794/95) and in the First and Second\nIntroduction into the Doctrine of Science (1797) he famously set\nout to demonstrate that the primordial act of self-positing lies at\nthe basis of all reality as far as it is an object of\nknowledge/cognition and agency. His starting-point is an\nepistemological question: how does it come that we cannot help but\nexperience objective reality the way we do, i.e., in terms of\nspatio-temporal objects standing in determinate relations? Where do\nthese representations of objects, of relations and especially the\nbelief that they exist come from? And (most importantly): how can we\nhave knowledge of objective reality that is not subject to skeptical\ndoubts? In order to answer these questions Fichte pursues at different\ntimes different strategies. The best known and most influential of\nthese attempts is documented in the first published version of his\nDoctrine of Science. In what follows we will focus primarily\non the line of thought presented in this text, although Fichte changed\nhis arguments considerably in the First and Second\nIntroductions into the Doctrine of Science.\n\nFollowing the early Doctrine of Science, we must, according\nto Fichte, accept three fundamental principles\n(Grunds\u00e4tze) of human knowledge without which we could\nnot even make sense of the idea that we can know that there is\nsomething real at all. The first states that self-consciousness or the\nI is a spontaneous (unconditioned) act that in taking place creates or\nposits the I as having existence or being (ein Akt, der im Vollzug\nsein eigenes Sein schafft). The I understood as this\nself-positing act that gives rise to its own being and reality Fichte\ncharacterizes as \u201cdeed-act\u201d, also translated as\n\u201cAct\u201d (Tathandlung), and it is through this\ndeed-act/Act that what we take to be real or having being comes to the\nfore. Fichte arrives at what he presents as his first principle of\nhuman knowledge on the basis of two assumptions. The first is that we\ncan only properly be said to know assertions (judgments or\npropositions) which exhibit the character of certainty\n[Gewissheit], or those which thus express what is actually\nand certainly the case; the second maintains that a regress in the\nprocess of justification with regard to such assertions can only be\navoided if we are able to furnish some principle or fundamental\nproposition which is \u201cutterly unconditioned\u201d\n[schlechthin unbedingt] (as Fichte puts it), one, that is,\nwhich cannot be derived from any other principle, and which, for its\npart, is of such a kind that it alone guarantees the utter certainty,\nand thus the indubitability, that is, the immunity to skeptical\nobjections, of a given proposition. This second assumption leads him\nto the claim that the unquestionable certainty of a proposition can\nnever be demonstrated discursively (by appeal to purely conceptual\nconsiderations) or intuitively (by appeal to any sensuous perception),\nand that, on the contrary, the ground of unconditional certainty can\nonly be found in the constitution of self-consciousness itself. Fichte\nidentifies as an appropriate method by means of which the principle in\nquestion can be derived a procedure which he calls \u201cabstractive\nreflection\u201d. This kind of reflection, according to Fichte, takes\nits point of departure from a proposition which everyone regards as\nunquestionably certain, from a so-called \u201cfact of empirical\nconsciousness\u201d. From this fact, this indubitable proposition,\nthe process of reflection isolates (abstracts) the elements which\nbelong to the content of such a proposition, i.e., belong to that\nabout which the proposition asserts something. What is supposedly\nleft, after this abstraction, is simply the form of the proposition\nwhich consists precisely in affirming the ascription, or\nnon-ascription, of a predicate to a subject. The proposition which\nFichte selects as the point of departure for his \u201cabstractive\nreflection\u201d is the logical law of identity in the form\n\u201cA = A\u201d, a law that is rightly regarded as\nutterly certain, i.e., certain without recourse to any further grounds\nand thus as intrinsically certain. This fact alone already shows that\nwe have the capacity (the faculty) of claiming something as certain\nwithout reference to any further grounds, or, in Fichte\u2019s own\nterminology, of \u201cpositing\u201d something absolutely [etwas\nschlechthin zu setzen]. Reflection on this fact shows according\nto Fichte that the utter certainty of the law of identity is grounded\nin the positing activity of the I (which in this case posits\nidentity), an activity which consists precisely in postulating the\nbeing of what has been posited as identical. Otherwise this activity\nwould not be real, would have no being.\n\nThis result, however, is not yet sufficient to give us the first\nunconditioned and fundamental principle of all knowledge. This is so\nbecause we have arrived at the I as the guarantee of the absolute\ncertainty of a proposition only on the basis of an empirical fact,\nnamely the proposition \u201cA is A\u201d which has\nbeen presupposed as utterly certain. Fichte now rightly observes that\nthe \u201cI am\u201d, as the condition of the certainty of an\nempirical fact, itself merely possesses the status of an empirical\nfact [Tatsache]\u2014if the utterly certain proposition were\nnot given, one would never be able to affirm the utter certainty of\nthe \u201cI am\u201d. Up to this point the \u201cI am\u201d has\n\u201conly been grounded on a fact, and possesses no other validity\nthan that attaching to a fact\u201d (GA I, 2, 257). But in order to discover\nthe first utterly unconditioned principle of all knowledge, we must\nestablish not only the utter certainty of the law of identity, but\nalso the unconditional certainty of the \u201cI am\u201d in such a\nway that this certainty does not depend upon the presence of a fact at\nall. In other words: we must be able to answer the question how the\nutterly unconditioned certainty of the proposition \u201cI am\u201d\nis possible. It is Fichte\u2019s reflections on this question which\nlead to his conception of the I as a deed-act/Act\n(Tathandlung). He reasons along the following lines: we know\nfrom our analysis of the conditions of certainty of the law of\nidentity that the I has the capacity to posit something absolutely in\nthe I. But in order to be able to posit something absolutely in the I,\nthe I itself must be posited. We have also already seen that the\nabsolute positing of the I consists in the activity of positing being.\nIf this is so, and if the \u201cI am\u201d is to depend on nothing\nelse as its condition, we must think of the I as the product of its\nown positing activity, since it would otherwise be quite impossible to\nexplain its being. Now this, in turn, is supposed to imply that we\nmust think the I as an activity which posits its own existence insofar\nas it is active: the I \n\n\nis at the same time the actor and the product of the act; the actor,\nand that which the activity brings forth; act and deed are one and the\nsame; and the \u201cI am\u201d is therefore the expression of an\nAct. (GA I, 2, 259) \n\n\nFor Fichte, a deed-act/Act is not supposed to be a fact, that is,\nsomething which is simply already discovered as given, since the Act\nis logically and ontologically prior to any facts insofar as it\nultimately constitutes (posits) everything which can be a fact for an\nI. The I, understood as Act, is supposed to be something absolutely\nposited precisely because it posits itself, and this self-positing\nconstitutes its essence and guarantees its being, its reality. Again,\nas Fichte says: \u201cThat whose being (essence) merely consists in\npositing itself as being, is the I, as absolute subject\u201d (GA I,\n2, 259). This means, for Fichte, that the I, so understood, displays\nall the characteristics which make it an appropriate candidate for the\nfirst utterly unconditioned principle of all knowledge. Fichte tries\nout various formulations for expressing this first principle in a\nreally adequate fashion. His most accessible formulation is certainly\nthe one he furnishes at the end of section 10 of the first paragraph\nof the Doctrine of Science: \u201cThe I originally posits\nits own being absolutely\u201d (GA I, 2, 261). This insight that the\nI must be conceived as self-positing activity, an activity whose\nperformance consists in its self-realization is meant to make any\ndistinction between epistemological and metaphysical idealism\nobsolete.\n\nThe second principle postulates a necessary act of counter-positing\n(Entgegensetzen) to the self-positing activity of the I\nresulting in what Fichte calls a Non-I, and the third focuses on an\nactivity that gives rise to the concept of divisibility. Fichte\nattempts to justify the introduction of these two principle on\nsystematic grounds, although these principles can only be described as\nunconditional in a qualified respect, by exploiting his own\ndistinction between the form and the content of a proposition.\nAccording to Fichte, every proposition (judgment) can be treated as\neither conditioned or unconditioned in relation to its content, or to\nits form, or to both. If a proposition is unconditioned in either or\nboth of these respects, then it can be described, in Fichte\u2019s\nterminology, as a fundamental principle [Grundsatz]. While\nthe second principle is meant to establish (as a condition of\nknowledge/cognition!) the possibility of the reality of\n\u201cotherness\u201d, of something which is not the I, the third\nprinciple shows how to mediate between the self-positing and the\ncounter-positing acts of the I by reciprocal limitation, thereby\nintroducing a subject-object opposition within the I. Both these\nprinciples are presented as codifications of two further unconditional\nacts of positing on the part of the I. According to Fichte, the I\npossesses, in addition to the capacity for self-positing that is\ncaptured in the first principle, the further capacity of positing a\nnon-I freely and simply (without any further ground). That is to say,\nit has the ability, through what Fichte calls an \u201cabsolute\nact\u201d [absolute Handlung], to posit something as non-I\nthat is opposed to the I. Fichte\u2019s second principle codifies this act\nof \u201ccounter-positing\u201d. Finally, the I is further\ncharacterized by a third capacity, that of freely and simply positing\nthe divisibility of the I and the non-I. The third principle\nspecifically captures this notion of divisibility.\n\nIt is not difficult to grasp what Fichte is attempting to accomplish\nwith the introduction of his second principle. It is supposed to do\njustice to our inexpungible everyday conviction that there is an\nexternal world independent of ourselves, the objects of which are\noutside of and distinguished from us, and to which we can relate in\nterms of knowledge and action alike. But for Fichte this conviction is\njustified not because an external world independent of ourselves\ncompels us to understand it as characterized in such and such a way.\nOn the contrary, it is justified because it belongs to the distinctive\nstructure of the I to organize its world dichotomously through the\nsubject-object distinction or the opposition of the I and the non-I.\nIt is more difficult, on the other hand, to grasp the significance\nwhich Fichte wishes to ascribe to the third principle of divisibility.\nThe motivation for introducing it is obviously to present the non-I\nnot only as the negation of the reality which the I claims to posit in\npositing its own being, but rather to ascribe independent reality,\nindependent being, to the non-I. In pursuing this purpose by recourse\nto the concept of divisibility, Fichte appears to make the implicit\npresupposition that being or reality should be regarded as a kind of\nquantity, as something given in degrees (intensively considered) or\nparts (extensively considered). Once we accept this presupposition,\nthen we cannot in fact avoid bringing something like Fichte\u2019s third\nprinciple into play. For the assumption that we have to conceive\nreality as a distributable plurality, together with the notion that\nthere are real objects possessed of an existence independent of the\nsubject, means that it is necessary, within the Fichtean model of\npositing, to identify a factor responsible for distributing reality\nbetween the I, understood as the knowing subject (and not as absolute\nself-positing ego), and the non-I, understood as the object that it is\nto be known. \n\nOn the basis of these three principles and by reflecting on the\npurported interplay between self-positing and counter-positing in a\nhighly original way, Fichte arrives at a portrait of reality in which\nall \u201cordinary\u201d objects, like walls, trees and people, and\ntheir \u201cnormal\u201d interactions and dependencies, like causal,\nspatio-temporal, and physical force relations, find a place. This\nportrait is claimed to be idealistic because it is the outcome of an\ninsight into the dynamics of these fundamental and opposed positing\nacts and because in the end these activities, according to Fichte,\nare, metaphysically speaking, all there is: \u201cfor the philosopher\nthere is acting, and nothing but acting; because, as a philosopher, he\nthinks idealistically\u201d (Second Introduction, section 7;\nWerke I, 498). Idealism thus starts to become what could be\ncalled from a traditional point of view a\n\u201chybrid\u201d position that intimately connects epistemological\nand ontological elements in that it \u201cexplains \u2026 the\ndeterminations of consciousness\u201d. i.e., our common sense\nconception of reality as an object of knowledge/cognition and agency,\n\u201cout of the acting of the intellect\n[Intelligenz]\u201d without thinking of the intellect as\nsome sort of existing subject:\n\n\nFor idealism the intellect is an acting and absolutely nothing else;\none should not even call it something active because by this\nexpression one points to something substantial which is the subject of\nthis activity. (First Introduction, section 7, Werke\nI, 440)\n\n\nA consequence that Fichte explicitly draws from this understanding of\nidealism is that one can no longer think of realism as a position that\nis opposed to idealism. Rather\n\n\nrealism, \u2026 i.e., the assumption that objects totally\nindependently of us exist outside of us, is contained in idealism\nitself and becomes explained and deduced in it. (Second\nIntroduction, footnote at end of section 1, Werke I,\n455)\n\n\nBecause in Fichte\u2019s philosophical world everything is based on\nthe I as a pure activity, it is not that surprising that his idealism\nvery often was called \u201csubjective idealism\u201d, even though\nhe would resist any identification with Berkeley\u2019s\nsubstance-accident form of immaterialism. He avoids that conception by\nintroducing what could be called an ontology of pure action.\n\nFichte\u2019s dynamic conception of idealism was adopted almost\nimmediately by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775\u20131854),\nwho in the first period of his philosophical career became next to\nFichte the most outspoken defender of this hybrid variety of idealism.\nIn doing so he transformed Fichte\u2019s I-centered approach to\nreality via an analysis of the conditions of knowledge/cognition and\nagency into an idealistic version of a monistic ontology. In this he\nwas followed by Hegel. Whereas Fichte had mainly struggled to find an\nadequate expression for his activity-based conception of a\nself-positing I and had referred to anything outside the I only as the\nnon-I posited by the I itself, in his early writings on the philosophy\nof nature Schelling tries to supplement Fichte\u2019s approach by\ngiving a much fuller account of nature, understood as everything that\nappears to be independent of us, in terms of the I-constituting\nactivities. Because of Schelling\u2019s elevation of nature to a\ncentral topic in his presentation of an idealistic worldview his\nposition became characterized, although somewhat misleadingly, as\n\u201cobjective idealism\u201d. On his account, we have to think of\nreality as an original unity (urspr\u00fcngliche Einheit) or\na primordial totality (uranf\u00e4ngliche Ganzheit) of\nopposites that is internally differentiated in such a way that every\nparticular item within reality can be seen as a partial, incomplete,\nor one-sided expression, manifestation, or interpretation of the most\nbasic dynamic opposition characteristic of the whole of reality. This\nview of reality, which in early Schelling is quite explicitly linked\nto Spinoza\u2019s one-substance ontology, obviously does not lead\ndirectly to any idealism whatsoever: one could just as well give it a\nnaturalistic reading. In order to connect a monistic ontology to\nidealism, one has to somehow identify the activities at work in the\nconstitution of the world-whole with mental or spiritual elements that\nare supposed to give conceptual structure to reality. This can be and\nwas done by Schelling at different stages of his philosophical career\nin different ways. In the first edition (1797) of his book Ideas\nfor a Philosophy of Nature (Ideen zu einer Philosophie der\nNatur), he set out to prove idealism by trying to show that\n\u201cthe system of Nature is at the same time the system of our\nmind\u201d (IP 30; SW 1, 134). This claim is not\nmeant to state a reciprocal relation of dependence between nature and\nmind and their characteristic features, i.e., according to Schelling,\nmatter and concept, thereby presupposing that nature and mind, matter\nand concept nevertheless have some reality independently of each\nother. He rather wants us to think of nature and mind, matter and\nconcept as being identical in the sense of being the same: the one is\nthe other and vice versa. The reason why we as finite minds have to\ndifferentiate between them at all lies in a double perspective which\nis forced on us by our natural predisposition to distinguish the\n\u201coutside us\u201d from the \u201cin us\u201d (cf. IP\n39; SW 1, 138) when looking at reality\u2014thus Schelling\nsees dualism as a psychological tendency but not a philosophical\noption. If this disposition and its conditions were understood in the\nright way, we would comprehend that, as he famously writes,\n\u201cNature should be made Mind visible, Mind the invisible\nNature\u201d (IP 42; SW 1, 151) thereby making room\nfor an idealistic conception of reality as World-Soul\n(On the World-Soul is also the title of a 1798 publication by\nSchelling.)\n\nAs a systematic counterpart to the construction of the phenomena of\nnature out of different dynamic factors (forces, activities), in 1800\nSchelling presented his System of Transcendental Idealism.\nHere he set out to demonstrate the development of mental phenomena out\nof these factors which he here calls the unconscious and the conscious\nactivity starting with sensation (Empfindung) and intuition\n(Anschauung) until he arrives via acts of willing at the\naesthetic activity manifested in works of art. He thinks of these\ntranscendental idealistic demonstrations as a necessary complement to\nhis philosophy of nature (cf. SW III, 331 f.) and describes\ntheir mutual relation thus:\n\n\nAs the philosophy of nature brings idealism forth out of realism, in\nthat it spiritualizes the laws of nature into laws of intelligence, or\nadds the formal to the material, so does transcendental philosophy\nbring realism out of idealism, by materializing the laws of\nintelligence into laws of nature, or adds the material to the\nform. (SW III, 352)\n\n\nOn this conception both together, philosophy of nature and\ntranscendental idealism, exhaust the entire scope of philosophy, which\nreveals itself in the end to be nothing but a \u201cprogressive\nhistory of self-consciousness\u201d (fortgehende Geschichte des\nSelbstbewusstseins) (SW III 331).\n\nThis early approach to establishing an idealistic monism and thereby\nvindicating a Fichte-inspired dynamic version of ontological idealism\nwas in turn given up by Schelling a couple of years later in the\nsecond edition of the Ideas and criticized by him as\nproviding a basis only for what he now calls \u201crelative\nidealism\u201d (IP 52; SW 1, 163). It is replaced\nby what he now names \u201cabsolute idealism\u201d (IP 50;\nSW 1, 162). Both his criticism of his earlier World-Soul\nconception and his endorsement of absolute idealism are at least to a\ncertain degree due to Hegel\u2019s discussion of Schelling\u2019s\nphilosophy in his Difference between Fichte\u2019s and\nSchelling\u2019s System of Philosophy (1801). Schelling\u2019s\nnew conception, which underlies what came to be known as his\n\u201cSystem of Identity\u201d (Identit\u00e4tssystem),\ntakes reality to be a dynamic whole which he describes as the\n\u201cundivorced\u201d (ungeschieden) or undifferentiated\nunity of the absolute-ideal or subjectivity and the absolute-real or\nobjectivity in an \u201ceternal act of cognition\u201d (IP\n47; SW 1, 157). This eternal act is all there is, it is\n\u201cthe absolute\u201d. It is disclosed in two fundamentally\ndifferent forms, one of which is characterized by the prevalence of\nsubjectivity whereas in the other form objectivity prevails. These two\nforms give rise to the distinction between an \u201cideal\nworld\u201d and \u201cNature\u201d (IP 49; SW 1,\n161). However, according to Schelling these forms have to be\ndistinguished from the \u201ceternal cognitive act\u201d or the\nabsolute from which the ideal world and Nature originate. This act is\npure activity of knowing that creates its objects in the very act of\ncognition by giving them a form. Because reality is conceived thus as\na dynamic self-organizing cognitive process that lies at the basis of\neven the most fundamental opposition between subject and object,\nSchelling thinks of his ontological monism as a version of idealism.\nHe writes:\n\n\nIf we therefore define philosophy as a whole according to that wherein\nit surveys and presents everything, namely the absolute act of\ncognition, of which even Nature is again only one side, the Idea of\nall ideas, then it is Idealism. Idealism is and remains, therefore,\nthe whole of philosophy, and only under itself does the latter again\ncomprehend idealism and realism, save that the first absolute Idealism\nis not to be confused with this other, which is of a merely relative\nkind. (IP 50; SW 1, 162)\n\n\nIn the end, then, after 1800 Schelling (arguably as well as Fichte in\nhis post-Jena period) seems pushed toward a \u201cnon-dogmatic\u201d\nidealism that combines ontological as well as epistemological idealism\nwithin a monistic framework.\n\nAlthough Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831) too embraces\na dynamical conception of idealism in the spirit of Fichte and\nSchelling, he deviates from both of them by not relying on mental\nactivities of some subject or other or on some primordial subjectless\ncognitive act as the most basic features of reality. He thus tries to\ntranscend any traditional form of idealism. Given his deep distrust of\nirreconcilable dichotomies, of anything unmediated and one-sided, one\ncannot expect Hegel to be an advocate of an idea of idealism that is\nconceived of in terms of an alternative to or an opposition against\nrealism or materialism or whatever else. He thus shares with Fichte\nand Schelling the hostility against any attempts to privilege idealism\nover and against realism (or something else) or the other way round,\nbut avoids the suspicion of a reversion to idealism in a monistic\nguise better than either of his predecessors. In the case of Hegel,\nthis hostility towards privileging idealism shows especially well in\nhis criticism of reductive programs as well as of\n\u201cbifurcating\u201d (entzweiend) or separating\npositions in metaphysics and epistemology. A reductive program\naccording to which either everything physical/material is reducible to\nsomething mental and thus confirms idealism or everything mental can\nbe reduced to something physical/material and thus gives rise to\nrealism or materialism is, in his eyes, \u201cridiculous\u201d (cf.\nGW 6, 290 ff). A bifurcating or separating position results\nfrom a project that is based on the claim that one has to distinguish\nbetween a world \u201cfor us\u201d and a world \u201cin\nitself\u201d, where the former is a subject-dependent and in this\nsense idealistic world while the latter is the \u201creal\u201d\nworld although it is essentially totally inaccessible by any\nsubjective cognitive means. It is because of its one-sidedness and its\nputting \u201cthe real\u201d outside of our grasp that such a\n\u201csubjective\u201d idealism is for Hegel unacceptable (see his\ncriticism of Kant in Faith and Knowledge, GW 4, 325\nff.). His objections to and his contempt for both idealism and realism\nin their mutually exclusive forms are well documented in almost all of\nhis writings throughout his philosophical career.\n\nThus, when Hegel in the second edition of his Science of\nLogic (1831) nevertheless claims that in the end \u201c[e]very\nphilosophy is essentially idealism or at least has it as its\nprinciple\u201d (GW 21, 142), he must mean by idealism\nsomething other than traditional idealism and certainly something\nother than Kant\u2019s indeterminate ontological realism. Rather, he\nmust mean by idealism a philosophical outlook that is immune against\nthe charge of grounding a philosophical system in a conception of\nreality that is committed to the acceptance of any irreconcilable\noppositions. Now, for Hegel the most fundamental opposition both from\na systematic and a historical perspective is the opposition between\nthinking and being, or rather, in the preferred terms, between subject\nand object. Looked at from a systematic perspective, this opposition\nis fundamental because of its apparent unavoidability, already at a\ndescriptive level, when it comes to an assessment of the ultimate\ncharacteristics of reality: after all, we want to be able to hold fast\nto the distinction between what is only (in) our (subjective) thought\nand what is (objectively) the case. Considered from a historical point\nof view it shows that\u2014at least within the tradition of\noccidental philosophy\u2014the opposition between thinking and being\nlies at the bottom of the most influential attempts (with very few\nexceptions like Parmenides and possibly Spinoza) to give a\nphilosophical account of the essence of reality and its multifarious\nways of appearing to us. The traditional conviction of the fundamental\nand irreconcilable opposition between thinking and being finds\nexpression in many different ways. These ways include the belief that\nthere is being that is totally independent of or without any relation\nto thinking, or the conviction that thinking is somehow external to\nbeing in that being is just the self-standing provider of material on\nwhich a by itself contentless (inhaltslos) thinking imposes a\ncertain conceptual form, or the assumption that even if there were no\nthinking there would be being and vice versa. However, according to\nHegel it can be demonstrated that to think of thinking and being as\nfundamentally opposed in any of these ways leads to inconsistencies\nresulting in contradictions, antinomies and other bewildering\ndeficiencies. Hence an idealistic philosophical system that is to\novercome these deficiencies has to get rid of the underlying\nfundamental opposition and to show that thinking and being are not\nopposed but ultimately the same. This claim as to the sameness or the\nidentity of thinking and being (subject and object) is the cornerstone\nof Hegel\u2019s metaphysical credo and together with some other\nassumptions leads relatively smoothly to a version of ontological\nmonism as the only convincing shape of an idealistic system.\n\nHowever, a closer look at how Hegel tries to realize a monistic\nidealism reveals that it proved rather complicated to establish a\nphilosophical system based on the identity of thinking and being or\nsubject and object. At the outset this project was to be realized\nwithin the boundaries of two conditions. The first was to present an\nargument in favor of the superiority of idealism that would not just\nmake the endorsement of idealism a question of individual character or\nwhat a person wants to be, a move he thought to be characteristic of\nboth Fichte\u2019s and Schelling\u2019s defense of idealism. The\nsecond was to abandon the view also, according to Hegel, sometimes to\nbe found in Fichte and Schelling, that one has to think of idealism as\nan alternative and in opposition to dogmatism/ realism/\nmaterialism. Not to meet these two conditions were in Hegel\u2019s\neyes two unacceptable shortcomings of any attempt to establish a\nconvincing idealistic worldview. He expressed his dissatisfaction with\nattempts of this kind to establish idealism as the superior approach\nin philosophy quite early (Faith and Knowledge, 1802) by\nreferring to them under the title \u201cphilosophy of reflection of\nsubjectivity\u201d (Reflexionsphilosophie der\nSubjektivit\u00e4t). This kind of philosophy of reflection,\nthough favoring subjectivity and hence giving priority to the\nconceptual and in this sense ideal contributions of the mind to what\nshows up as reality is still according to Hegel stuck in what he later\nused to call the \u201copposition of consciousness\u201d\n(Gegensatz des Bewusstseins) (in both the,\nPhenomenology and the Science of Logic). This kind\nof philosophy is committed to a mode of thinking that takes place\nwithin a framework in which the opposition of thinking and being or\nsubject and object is still basic, dissolved only superficially by\neither abstracting from one of the opposed sides or by establishing a\nrelation of domination between the elements opposed, without\ntranscending and transforming them into a whole, his renowned\n\u201cSubject-Object\u201d, a whole that is both constituted by\nthese elements, the subject and the object, and that at the same time\nconstitutes them as its own internal differentiations.  This way of\novercoming oppositions by thinking of the elements opposed as having\nsignificance only insofar as their mutual relation can be conceived of\nas being constituted by the unity they together form led Hegel to\nclaim that in order to avoid the idea of self-standing or irreducible\noppositions and hence to escape the charge of one-sidedness in cases\nwhere the prioritization of opposites is at stake, one has to follow\nthe methodological maxim that for every opposition there has to be a\nunity in place that consists of the elements opposed. Hegel took this\nprinciple to imply that the \u201cabsolute\u201d, the totality of\nwhat there is and can be, must be conceived of as what he sometimes\ncalls the \u201cidentity of identity and non-identity\u201d\n(Difference-Writing, beginning of Schelling chapter) or as\nthe \u201cunity of unity and multiplicity/diversity\u201d\n(Natural Law Essay, section II) where the terms\n\u201cidentity/unity\u201d in each of these formulations are meant\nto refer to both the whole that gives rise to what is opposed and to\none of the elements in opposition.\n\nBut does the acceptance of such a methodological recipe as a means by\nwhich to transcend oppositions in order to solve the problem of\none-sidedness not just give rise to a justification of an idealism\nthat is not just a one-sided alternative to\nrealism/dogmatism/materialism? It appears that on the basis of this\nmethodological device two sensible options are available both of which\ndo not settle the question of superiority. However, whereas the first\noption leads to a negative result regarding the alleged superiority of\nidealism, the second opens up at least the chance of a positive\nresult. Those favoring the negative option would start from the claim\nthat the very idea of a \u201cSubject-Object\u201d, i.e., of a whole\nthat is prior to and constitutive of its elements, cannot be defended\nby any rational means. They would end up recommending just giving up\non idealism as well as its opposites as positions whose superiority\ncan be defended philosophically, because there is no rational way to\ndecide which of them has to be favored over the other. It is in fact a\nreaction Hegel himself sometimes advocates when he states, e.g., in\nhis Lectures on the History of Philosophy (chapter on later\nskeptics) that both idealism and dogmatism have the status of\nproclamations/assurances and thus turn out to be equipollent.\nSupporters of the positive option would have to give credit to the\nrationality of the strategy, sketched above, of how to overcome\noppositions in a philosophically acceptable way and thus would allow\nfor a \u201cSubject-Object\u201d as the common whole in which the\nopposed sides can be united. But even such an admission would not lead\ndirectly to an argument for the superiority of idealism. It would only\nprovide a reason for favoring a position that could be described as\nreal-idealism (Real-Idealismus), a synthetic product that\nintegrates idealism and its opposites into a unity whose elements,\nthough still distinguishable, are at the same time in some sense\nidentical or (in Hegel\u2019s idiom) sublated (aufgehoben).\nIt is easy to show that most of the German idealists were strongly\nattracted by this positive solution. At some point in their\nphilosophical careers both Fichte and Schelling explicitly used the\nterm \u201cReal-idealism\u201d in order to characterize their views.\nEven Hegel late in life, in a review of a treatise by Ohlert\n(GW 16, 287 ff.), made use of this term as a name for his\nmetaphysical teachings.\n\nThis solution seems to have been in line with Hegel\u2019s way of\nconceiving of how to overcome oppositions in his early Jena writings.\nUnsurprisingly, however, he became dissatisfied with such a tactic\nbecause of its inherent limitations. This dissatisfaction shows\nexplicitly for the first time in the preface of the Phenomenology\nof Spirit. From then onwards he tried in different ways to find a\njustification of idealism in sensu stricto, i.e., a\njustification of a view that (1) attributes priority to non-sensible\nactivities, especially to the activity of thinking, that (2) makes\nrealism/materialism/dogmatism obsolete and that (3) allows for\nsubject-object identity without thereby being committed to\nReal-Idealism. The reasons for his dissatisfaction with attempts that\nlead to Real-Idealism (among them most of his own pre-phenomenological\nsystematic sketches) are quite simple. In the first place, it is\nrather obvious that the move to transcend oppositions by making the\nopposed elements parts of an integrating unity looks like a makeshift,\na terminological stipulation that cannot do justice to what it is\nmeant to achieve, namely, to allow the opposed elements to develop out\nof a unity that is prior to them. Instead of commencing with a\ndeveloping unity, this move, according to Hegel, remains damaged by\npresupposing the opposed components as self-standing, thereby making\nthe unity dependent on the elements and not the other way around.\nSecondly, the unity presented as resulting from a process of\nintegration of what is taken to be opposed cannot be conceived as\nrepresenting a real identity of opposites because of its status as a\nsynthetic product. Unities in order to qualify as real unities after\nHegel\u2019s taste could be pictured in analogy to the\n\u201cKippfiguren\u201d of Gestalt psychology.\nBoth these reasons (together with a couple of more idiosyncratic ones)\nled Hegel to believe that the method of overcoming oppositions by\nstipulating unities is not ultimately feasible for the task at hand,\nhence not able to solve the problem of one-sidedness and consequently\nof no use in the endeavor of justifying the superiority of\nidealism.\n\nThe question, then, is how to proceed in order to establish a version\nof the subject-object-identity idea that is neither subject to the\ncharge of one-sidedness nor to that of just postulating it without any\nargument as a given fact. Though this seems to be a purely technical\ntask, i.e., a task to conceptualize the Subject-Object unity/identity\nin a different way than had been done in the real-idealism approach,\nand although Hegel recognized early the insufficiencies of\nFichte\u2019s, Schelling\u2019s, and even his own initial\nsuggestions for overcoming oppositions, it took him quite a while to\ncome up with a proposal that both avoids the one-sidedness problem and\nthe suspicion that it operates with unfounded assumptions while at the\nsame time it supports the superiority of idealism as a metaphysical\ndoctrine. This is so because he had to realize that it is not just a\nmetaphysical/ontological question as to the status of the\nSubject-Object unity/identity that is at stake, but that there is an\nepistemological worry to be answered before the\nmetaphysical/ontological question can even be addressed. As became\nincreasingly clear to him, the task he had to face consists in\ndemonstrating two things: (1) that it is epistemologically\nwarranted to claim that there are indeed unities of basic oppositions\n(like subject-object, identity-nonidentity, unity-multiplicity,\nthinking-being) that precede their constitutive elements/parts in that\nthey are at the basis of their constitution while at the same time\nconsisting of them and (2) that it is\nmetaphysically/ontologically necessary to think of the most\nbasic unity/identity, i.e., that of subject and object in an\nidealistic fashion, i.e., as a spiritual/mental (geistig)\nitem paradigmatically realized in thinking. For Hegel it is the\nepistemological task that must be solved first before the\nmetaphysical task of giving an idealistic account of the\nsubject-object unity/identity in terms of the sameness of what is\ndifferent/opposed can be tackled. His idealism needs epistemology as\nwell as metaphysics.\n\nThe first task mentioned amounts to answering the question: how can\none convince what he calls in the Phenomenology a\n\u201cnatural consciousness\u201d (nat\u00fcrliches\nBewusstsein), i.e., an ordinary human being that is committed to\nthe common discursive/conceptual standards of reasoning\u2014how can\none convince such a subject by discursive means (and not just\nby appeal to some strange non-standard procedures like intellectual\nintuition or revelation) of the epistemic legitimacy of the assumption\nof a subject-object unity/identity that is prior to and constitutive\nof its parts/elements? Because the answer to this epistemological\nquestion is meant to ground the metaphysical/ontological claim\nconcerning the ultimate constitution of reality, Hegel thought fit to\naddress it in the form of an introduction to what subsequently had to\nbe elaborated in a systematic way as a metaphysical doctrine about\nwhat there ultimately is. This epistemological task turned out to be\nmuch more difficult than Hegel initially thought. This is documented\nby the surprisingly many numbers of different sketches of what he took\nto be an \u201cintroduction\u201d to his system even before he\npublished the best known version of this introduction, the\nPhenomenology of Spirit in 1807. Actually, the\nPhenomenology is not just the best known, it is the only\nversion of an introduction Hegel ever elaborated in detail, at least\nin print, that explicitly addressed the task at hand as an\nepistemological problem. In the second edition of the exposition\nproper of his system, the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical\nSciences in Outline published much later in 1827 (first edition\n1817) he chose a different introductory path to his metaphysical\nproject under the title \u201cPositions of Thought towards\nObjectivity\u201d (Stellungen des Gedankens zur\nObjektivit\u00e4t) for reasons that have to do with a different\nassessment of the epistemological task. However, the\nPhenomenology still remains the most straightforward attempt\nto settle the question as to the metaphysical priority of the\nsubject-object identity as an epistemological problem.\nAlthough looking at Hegel\u2019s different pre-phenomenological\nattempts to find a suitable introduction to his central\nmetaphysical/ontological doctrine is an interesting enterprise in its\nown right, it cannot be dealt with here in detail. It would lead to a\ndiscussion of why Hegel initially, i.e., from 1801 to maybe 1806,\nthought of what he in this early period called \u201clogic\u201d as\na discipline that could function as an introduction to his\nmetaphysics. Of all the fragments that were passed down to us from\nthis period the most complete \u201clogical\u201d version of an\nintroduction is the so-called Jena Systemdraft II from\n1804/05. This system-draft contains a so-called Logic as a\ndiscipline that is meant to present the process of\n\u201celevating\u201d (erheben) an epistemic subject\nequipped with traditionally accepted methodological and logical\nconvictions to the \u201cstandpoint of science\u201d (Standpunkt\nder Wissenschaft), i.e., to a standpoint that is based on the\nmetaphysical doctrine of Subject-Object identity. This process is\ndelineated by Hegel as an introductory logical process that proceeds\nby means of a criticism of standard logical forms like judgments and\ninferences as well as of object constituting concepts, i.e., of\nKantian categories.\n\nIn order to deal with the epistemological problem of demonstrating the\npriority of unities/identities over and against their opposed\nelements, in the Phenomenology Hegel starts with an analysis\nof the conditions of knowledge where knowledge is understood as an\nachievement of a subject\u2019s activity of dealing\ndiscursively/conceptually with the objective world or the world of\nobjects. For him an inquiry into the conditions of knowledge is the\nright starting point because knowledge understood as the activity of\ngaining conceptual access to the world is the only discursive\nattitude available to a subject towards determining what is\nobjectively real, i.e., towards the world. The approach Hegel is\npursuing in order to arrive at the desired result, i.e., the proof of\nthe priority of unity/identity, can be outlined thus: he first\nintroduces the conception of knowledge (Erkennen) that is\nleading his investigation. According to this conception knowledge is\nto be taken as a discursive/conceptual relation established between a\nsubject and an object that allows for some sort of correspondence\n(Entsprechung) between them. The possibility of this\ncorrespondence depends on getting hold of structural features that are\nshared by subject and object on the basis of which a knowledge\nrelation can be established. This is the assumption of isomorphism\nthat underlies any epistemologically-motivated move toward\nidealism.\n\nWith the concept of knowledge settled, Hegel chooses as the point of\ndeparture for his analysis a configuration of this knowledge relation\nbetween subject and object that proceeds on the assumption that the\nrelata of this relation, i.e., the subject and the object stand in\ncomplete opposition to each other, each of them being self-standing\nand a pure another to each other. This configuration is what Hegel\ncalls \u201csense certainty\u201d, a configuration in which the\nknowledge relation is supposed to obtain between two items, a\nsubject-this and an object-this, that are totally isolated from each\nother, have no conceptualizable internal connection whatsoever. Such a\nconception of the knowledge relation proves to be unwarranted because,\naccording to Hegel, it can be shown that the idea of a cognitive\nrelation between totally independent items makes no sense. Instead one\nhas to acknowledge that the very attempt to establish such a\n(unreasonable) conception already presupposes that there indeed is a\nstructural affinity between subject and object, an affinity that\nenables an object to be an object for a subject and that enables the\nsubject to relate to the object. Hegel wants us to think of this\nmutual affinity in terms of conceptual determinations necessary to\ncome up both with the concept of an object of knowledge and with a\ntenable account of a knowing subject. Thus in the case of e.g.,\n\u201csense certainty\u201d the affinity claim is expressed in the\nresult that in order to be an epistemic object an object of cognition\nhas to exhibit the conceptual characteristics of universality\n(Allgemeinheit) and singularity (Einzelnheit)\nprovided by the subject and that the subject itself in order to be\nthought of as an epistemic subject must have at its disposal the\nconceptual resources (in this case the concepts of universality and\nsingularity) necessary to determine the conceptual features of\nits object. The entire process run through in the\nPhenomenology is meant to enrich the features a subject and\nan object have to share in order to arrive at a complete concept of\nboth what a subject and an object are.\n\nIn the Phenomenology the initial scenario of \u201csense\ncertainty\u201d that is based on the absolute opposition between the\nknowing subject and the object known sets the stage for a long series\nof configurations or models of knowledge that is aimed at\ndemonstrating that knowledge in a complete or absolute sense can only\ntake place in a setting where subject and object share all\ntheir respective structural features, i.e., where both, the subject\nand the object, have the same conceptual determinations and thus are\nidentical. This amounts according to Hegel to the insight that if\nknowledge is analyzed in terms of a subject-object relation there is\nfor knowledge (Erkennen) in the end no difference\nbetween the subject and the object or, as he is fond of saying, that\nthere is a difference that is no difference (ein Unterschied, der\nkeiner ist). Among other things this means for Hegel that\nknowledge in the strict sense is ultimately self-knowledge or a state\nof affairs where a subject that stands in the relation of knowing\n(erkennen) to an object is \u201cin truth\u201d related to\nitself, or, as he famously puts it, in the act of knowing\n(Erkenntnisakt) the subject \u201cis in the other (the\nobject) with itself (exclusively related to itself)\u201d (im\nAnderen bei sich selbst sein).\n\nThis epistemological account presented in the Phenomenology\nof how the very possibility of discursive/conceptual knowledge is\nbased in an original identity of opposites or a subject-object\nunity/identity becomes metaphysical/ontological implications because\nof the conviction Hegel shares with the other post-Kantian idealists\nthat knowledge is a real relation. By this he and his idealistic\nallies mean (a) that knowledge is a relation between real relata and\n(b) that knowledge is real only if the relata are real. This\nconviction puts constraints on how to conceive of this unity/identity\nwhen it comes to its content (in a metaphorically analogous way in\nwhich, say, in propositional logic a semantics puts constraints on the\ninterpretation of its syntax). This unity/identity established as the\nbasis of knowledge has to meet (at least) two conditions. First of all\nit has to be such that the subject-object split can be grounded in it\nand secondly it must allow for an interpretation according to which it\nis real or has being (Sein). These conditions function as\nconstraints on how to conceive of subject-object-unity/identity\nbecause they specify what can count as an acceptable interpretation (a\nsemantics) of an otherwise purely structural item (a syntactic\nfeature). Without meeting these two conditions all we have by now\n(i.e., at the end of the Phenomenology) is a claim as to the\ngrounding function of a unity/identity of subject and object structure\n(a syntactic item) that is still lacking an interpretation as to the\ncontent (the semantic element) of all the terms involved in that\nstructure.\n\nIt is by providing an interpretation to the unity/identity structure\nthat Hegel arrives at a defense of idealism in a non-oppositional\nsense. Put somewhat distant from his terminology but relying heavily\non his own preliminary remarks on the question \u201cWith What must\nthe Beginning of Science be made?\u201d in the Science of\nLogic, his line of thought can be sketched roughly thus: the\nPhenomenology has demonstrated that knowledge can only be\nrealized if it establishes a relation between real items. These items\nhave to be structurally identical. Realized or \u201creal\u201d\nknowledge (wahres Wissen) in contradistinction to\nopinion/defective knowledge (what Hegel calls \u201cfalse\nknowledge\u201d) is a discursive/conceptual relation that can only be\nestablished by thinking. Hence if there is knowledge thinking must be\nreal, must have being (Sein haben). Now, thinking is an\nobjective, a real activity in the sense that it\ngives rise to determinations that constitute both the subject and the\nobject. Because it is a discursive/conceptual activity its\nreality/objectivity implies that what is constituted by it, i.e., the\nsubject and the object have to be conceived of as\ndiscursive/conceptual structures whose reality/being just consists in\nnothing else than their being thought\u2014not\ntheir being the object of thought. Conceived of that way\nthinking not only fulfills the two conditions mentioned above (i.e.,\nit grounds the subject-object divide and it is real, has being), it is\nat the same time the only candidate to satisfy them (because\nthere is no other discursive/conceptual activity available).\nTherefore, in order to account for a discursive/conceptual model of\nreality one has to start from the identity of thinking and being or\nfrom the fact that only thinking is real.\n\nFrom this argument as to the sole reality of thinking, it is easy to\nderive a new conception of idealism that is not subject to the\nobjections mentioned above that Hegel raised against (what were, in\nhis eyes) the one-sided attempts by his fellow post-Kantians, in\nparticular Fichte and Schelling. If all there is is thinking and if\nthinking is taken to be not only/primarily an activity of a (human)\nsubject or something that can be present to the senses, but is\nconceived of as self-standing discursive/conceptual and in this\nrespect ideal activity that opens up first and foremost a space for\nopposition in the general shape of subject and object then indeed, as\nhe puts it, \u201cevery philosophy is essentially idealism\u201d\n(GW 21, 142) as long as it shares (regardless of whether\nexplicitly or implicitly) this basic conviction of the reality of\nthinking. This idealism is non-oppositional, for it \u201cthe\nopposition between idealistic and realistic philosophy is therefore\nwithout meaning\u201d (GW 21, 142). One might doubt whether\nthe term \u201cidealism\u201d is a very fitting name for the\nposition Hegel endorses. In a way this term is rather misleading in\nthat it seems to suggest that for Hegel the term\n\u201cthinking\u201d has connotations that point in the direction of\nthe mental, the spiritual. Though Hegel definitely wants these\nconnotations to obtain in certain contexts, they play no role in his\nmetaphysical views. There the only relevant fact is the reality of\nthinking and the consequences of this fact. Hegel himself seems not to\nhave been too happy with the term \u201cidealism\u201d as a\ncharacterization of his philosophy. This is shown by the fact that he\nvery rarely uses it to this purpose. However, setting aside questions\nof terminology, it is safe to say that for Hegel\u2019s general\nconception and defense of idealism three points are the most important\nto acknowledge: (1) it is a metaphysical (and not primarily\nan epistemological) conception of idealism, (2) it is a conception\nthat establishes idealism by relying on the sole reality of thinking\nwhich in turn is taken to be an immediate fact, a given\n(Vorhandenes, cf. GW 21, 55f.) in an almost\nCartesian fashion, (3) however, contrary to the Cartesian \u201cI\nthink\u201d this real thinking is not conceived of as an activity of\na human or non-human subject but as an autochtonous activity that in\nthe process of its own determination gives rise to conceptions of both\nsubject and object founded in the primordial identity of thinking and\nbeing. Hegel certainly departs from Berkeley\u2019s substance-based\nidealism, on which all that exists is finite minds and their ideas and\nthe infinite mind and its, although it can certainly be asked what\npure thinking not grounded in thinkers is supposed to be.\n\nHegel\u2019s basic claim as to the identity of thinking and being\nmight be said to have some initial plausibility if one takes such a\nclaim to be a somewhat metaphorical expression of the view that in our\nways of thinking about objects some conceptual elements are invariably\ninvolved. Understood along these lines, Hegel\u2019s claim could be\nconsidered, as it often is, as nothing but a peculiar version of\nKant\u2019s empirical realism. Such an interpretation might even be\nsuggested by the impression that Hegel as well as Kant takes thinking\nto be an activity that is characterized by operating on and with\nconcepts and that what Hegel calls \u201cbeing\u201d can easily be\nidentified with what within Kant\u2019s epistemological framework is\ncalled \u201creality\u201d, that is, the empirical reality of\nintuited objects rather than their transcendent grounds. Although this\nimpression is by no means entirely groundless, it is still misleading\nbecause it does not do justice to the ontological connotations that\nHegel wants to connect with this claim. For Hegel\u2019s idealism it\nis indeed essential to convince us that it is a demonstrable fact that\nthe world ultimately has to be conceived of as a thought (and thus as\na conceptual item) that has objective existence or (in his\nterminology) that the world is the unique (because all-encompassing)\nConcept (written with a capital \u201cC\u201d) that is engaged in\nthe process of its own realization (its objective expression), i.e., a\nrealized concept. Therefore each individual object contained in the\nworld, be it a physical (a tree, a lemon), a social (a society, a\nstate) or a cultural (an artwork, a religion) object, has to be taken\nto be an element in this process, thus having the status of a partial\nmanifestation of the all-encompassing Concept/world (subject/object,\nthinking/being). Obviously this conception of what the world and the\nobjects it consists of really are\u2014if it is not meant to be just\nanother variation of either a dogmatic idealist claim in the spirit of\nBerkeley or a transcendental idealism \u00e0 la Kant\u2014has to\nuse the terms \u201cconcept\u201d and \u201creal\u201d in a way\nthat is different from their traditional or normal use in the history\nof modern philosophy since Descartes. And so it is. For Hegel a\nconcept is not a general representation in the mind of a subject nor\nis the term \u201creal\u201d meant to be restricted to hinting at\nthe presence of some type of matter either physical or mental. Rather,\nHegel thinks of a concept as providing what could be called a\n\u201cstructure plan\u201d for its own realization, and he takes the\nterm \u201creal\u201d to designate the successful realization of a\nstructure plan or a concept; thus Hegel attempts to use these terms in\na teleological sense without any mentalistic (i.e., psychological or\nrepresentationalistic) ontological commitments. Although these\nsomewhat unconventional connotations of Hegel\u2019s concepts of\n\u201cconcept\u201d and \u201creal\u201d (which have a certain\nbasis in a peculiar German use of these terms) might be confusing,\nthey are\u2014at least in his eyes\u2014by no means without\ndescriptive value. Thus, to use examples that Hegel mentions in the\nPreface to the Phenomenology of Spirit, it makes\nperfectly good sense to describe a fully grown oak-tree as the\nrealization of its concept, i.e., what is contained as genetic\nstructure in the acorn out of which the tree has developed, or to\nthink of a political state as a realization of what belongs to the\nconcept of a state, making the state the realization of a concept or\nan \u201cobjective thought\u201d. However, although these examples\ncan throw some light on why Hegel might think of his approach as\nleading to an ultimately idealistic conception of reality, the\nidealistic aspect of his view strictly speaking has to do with his\ntheory of what he calls \u201cthe Concept\u201d (with a\n\u201cC\u201d) whose realization is the world. It is this theory\nthat commits him not just to idealism because of its radical\nconceptualism but also to metaphysical monism because of the\nsingularity of the Concept, i.e., the world. Within the framework of\nthis theory the Concept is conceived of as providing something like\nthe master plan or the universal structure that governs not only the\nconceptual structure of individual kinds of objects but the structure\nof individual objects as well. This universal structure comes about by\nmeans of a process of conceptual self-determination that results in a\ncomplete exposition of the conceptual elements contained in the\nConcept, a process that is documented in Hegel\u2019s Science of\nLogic. This process of self-determination is understood by Hegel\nas the way in which the Concept realizes itself. After all, the\nConcept, being a thought-object or an object-thought itself, must also\nhave reality or being and thus has to realize itself.\n\nAlthough Hegel definitely wants to overcome what he takes to be\nshortcomings both of Kant\u2019s philosophy and of the positions of\nhis post-Kantian contemporaries Fichte and Schelling, at the same time\nhe does not want to give up on the post-Kantian project of\ntransforming Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism, which restricts\nknowledge to the subject\u2019s own experience, into a robust new\nidealism based on dynamic principles of world-constitution. He differs\nfrom Fichte and Schelling in that he does not ground these principles\neither in some activity of a subject (Fichte) or in a cognitively\ninaccessible primordial unity (Schelling) but in the idea of a\nthoroughly conceptual organization of reality giving rise to what he\ncalls in the introduction to the second edition of the Science of\nLogic an \u201cintellectual view of the universe\u201d\n(Intellektualansicht des Universums) (GW 21, 34). In\nthis way, Hegel does try to reconcile the need for conceptual elements\nconstitutive of traditional epistemological idealism with (most of)\nthe categorical commitments characteristic of traditional ontological\nidealism yet in a way that no longer requires the opposition between\nepistemology and ontology.\n",
