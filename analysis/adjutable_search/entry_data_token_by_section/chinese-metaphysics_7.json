Impartiality and Differentiation\n\nNo pre-Buddhist Chinese philosophers claimed that the qualitatively\ndifferentiated world we experience is an illusion, but their monistic\nmetaphysics privileged connectedness and unity. While patterns of\ndifferentiation may be objective, individuation\n(i.e., what counts as a thing) is provisional and contextual. It is\nalways possible to view all things as forming one whole or one body,\nand this unity tends toward equalizing things. From our contextual\npoint of view, one thing can be said to be bigger, better, or more\nbeautiful than another, but from a broader perspective all things have\nthe same status as parts of a single body. This could lead toward\nskepticism of absolute values (as in the Zhuangzi) or toward\nan imperative to care for all things. Hui Shi (c. 380\u2013305 BCE)\nis reported to have said: \u201cCare overflowingly for all the myriad\nthings; heaven and earth form one body [yiti\n\u4e00\u9ad4]\u201d (Guo 1978, 33: 1102; Ziporyn 2009: 124). This\ncan be seen as a radicalization of the Mohist claim that heaven\ngenerates all human beings and thus cares for them all equally, a\npoint rooted in the early Zhou view of heaven as protecting the\npeople. A progression toward more and more radical impartiality is\nmapped out in a passage from the L\u00fcshi chunqiu\n\u5442\u6c0f\u6625\u79cb, a text compiled around 239 BCE. The\npassage begins with a statement of nature\u2019s impartiality:\n\n\nThe world is not one person\u2019s world but the world\u2019s world.\nThe harmony of yinyang does not grow just one type. Sweet dew\nand timely rain are not partial to one thing. The birth of the myriad\npeoples does not favor one person.\n\n\nThis is followed by story contrasting Kongzi (Confucius) and Lao Dan\n(Laozi):\n\n\nA person of Jing lost a bow and was not willing to search for it,\nsaying, \u201cA person of Jing lost it, a person of Jing will find\nit, so why search?\u201d Kongzi heard this and said, \u201cIf you\nleave out \u2018Jing,\u2019 then it is acceptable\u201d. Lao Dan\nheard it and said, \u201cIf you leave out \u2018person,\u2019 then\nit is acceptable.\u201d Thus it was Lao Dan who reached the utmost\nimpartiality. (Chen Qiyou 1984, 1/4:\n 45)[6]\n\n\nThe level of impartiality attributed to Laozi eliminates the\npossibility of loss, leading to equanimity.\n\nAs the reference to Kongzi suggests, this tendency toward inclusivity\nthreatened the humanistic ethics of the Confucians. Their main\nresponse addressed a gap in the cosmogonies exemplified by the\nLaozi. These cosmogonies explained the dynamism inherent in\nparticular things and the broader patterns of nature, but they did not\naddress the differences between kinds of things\u2014what makes human\nbeings differ consistently from dogs? The concept that arose to fill\nthis gap and to justify Confucian humanism is xing \u6027.\nXing is most often translated as the \u201cnature\u201d of\na thing or kind of thing, but it refers specifically to the way a\nthing responds spontaneously to its environment. In human beings,\nxing manifests itself primarily as desires and emotions,\nbroadly labeled as qing \u60c5 (genuine affects). One of\nthe key questions debated by the Confucians was the degree to which\nethical concerns like care, respect, and shame were embedded in these\nnatural spontaneous affects.\n\nXing became a foundation for theories of motivation but its\nroots are in metaphysics. Xing derives from heaven and is\nclosely connected to sheng \u751f, the term meaning to live\nor generate. Xing moves from the generic creativity or\nvitality of nature to the specific life processes of kinds of things.\nMore concretely, xing was conceptualized as the dynamic flow\nof qi (vital energy). One recently discovered text from the\nlate 4th century BCE (known as the Xing zi ming\nchu \u6027\u81ea\u547d\u51fa) brings these levels\ntogether:\n\n\nAlthough all human beings have xing, the heart lacks a stable\nresolve. It awaits things and then stirs, awaits being pleased and\nthen acts, awaits practice and then stabilizes. The vital energies\n(qi \u6c23) of pleasure, anger, grief, and sadness are\nxing. Their appearing on the outside is because things\nstimulate them. Xing comes out from what is allotted\n(ming) and what is allotted comes down from heaven\n(tian). (S. Cook 2012, 697\u2013700, slips 1\u20133).\n\n\nThe term qi, translated here as \u201cvital energy\u201d,\nis already well known in English. It was originally taken as one of\nseveral kinds of stuff, connected with air and breath, but it\neventually became the dominant label for the basic stuff of the world,\nused to explain all kinds of dynamic processes, from the formation of\nheaven and earth to patterns of weather to the processes of the human\n heart.[7]\n It was closely connected with life and the generative power of\nnature. In this passage, human affects (including desires and a\ntendency to approve or disapprove) are the movement of this\nqi when stimulated by events in the world. This is part of\nthe Confucian response to the focus on wuwei and reducing\ndesires in texts like the Laozi and\nZhuangzi\u2014affects like sorrow and care arise\nspontaneously, by ziran. They are as natural for human beings\nas it is for water to flow downward or for trees to grow toward the\nsun.\n\nIt may seem that this topic has drifted from metaphysics into ethics,\nbut human actions are not different in kind from the movements of\nother things in the world, and human motivation expresses the tendency\ntoward growth inherent in the very nature of existence. The use of\nxing and ziran in relation to motivation differs\nfrom the concerns around free will in almost every way, but they all\narise as ways of explaining how human choices relate to the forces\ndriving change in the rest of the natural world, or even how human\nchoices relate to the very nature of being. In this way, they unite\nmetaphysics and ethics.\n\nBeyond its role in explaining motivation, xing helps explain\nthe organization of the world into individuals and kinds. In a series\nof passages arguing with a rival named Gaozi, Mengzi shows that\nwhatever would explain the natures of things must have its own\ndynamism and directionality, and it must explain the specific\ndifferences between kinds of things (6A1\u20133). On the one side,\nxing differentiates things in terms of coherent patterns of\nforce, providing a contextual and provisional basis for individuation.\nOne can refer to the xing of a human being but also the\nxing of the human mouth (6A7), to the xing of a\nmountain ecosystem (6A8) or the xing of a single tree (6A1).\nOn the other side, xing was generally used as a species\nconcept\u2014things of the same kind have the same xing.\nMengzi\u2019s ethical philosophy is based on his belief that human\nbeings share certain ways of responding to the world, all having the\nsame xing. The status of species, though, was a point of\ncontroversy, linked to the question of whether or not all human beings\ncould be held to the same standards. A more radical line of thought\ntook each individual as having its own unique xing, a view\nrooted in parts of the Zhuangzi and developed later by Guo\nXiang (?\u2013312 CE) (Chiu forthcoming).\n",
