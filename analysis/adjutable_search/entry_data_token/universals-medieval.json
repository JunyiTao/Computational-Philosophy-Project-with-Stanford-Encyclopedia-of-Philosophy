Introduction\n\nThe inherent problems with Plato\u2019s original theory were\nrecognized already by Plato himself. In his Parmenides Plato\nfamously raised several difficulties, for which he apparently did not\nprovide satisfactory answers. Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.), with all\ndue reverence to his teacher, consistently rejected Plato\u2019s\ntheory, and heavily criticized it throughout his own work. (Hence the\nfamous saying, amicus Plato sed magis amica\n veritas).[1]\n Nevertheless, despite this explicit doctrinal conflict, Neo-Platonic\nphilosophers, pagans (such as Plotinus ca. 204\u2013270, and\nPorphyry, ca. 234\u2013305) and Christians (such as Augustine,\n354\u2013430, and Boethius, ca. 480\u2013524) alike, observed a\nbasic concordance between Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s\napproach, crediting Aristotle with an explanation of how the human\nmind acquires its universal concepts of particular things from\nexperience, and Plato with providing an explanation of how the\nuniversal features of particular things are established by being\nmodeled after their universal\n archetypes.[2]\n In any case, it was this general attitude toward the problem in late\nantiquity that set the stage for the ever more sophisticated medieval\n discussions.[3]\n In these discussions, the concepts of the human mind, therefore, were\nregarded as posterior to the particular things represented by these\nconcepts, and hence they were referred to as universalia post\nrem (\u2018universals after the thing\u2019). The universal\nfeatures of singular things, inherent in these things themselves, were\nreferred to as universalia in re (\u2018universals in the\nthing\u2019), answering the universal exemplars in the divine mind,\nthe universalia ante rem (\u2018universals before the\n thing\u2019).[4]\n All these, universal concepts, universal features of singular things,\nand their exemplars, are expressed and signified by means of some\nobviously universal signs, the universal (or common) terms of human\nlanguages. For example, the term \u2018man\u2019, in English is a\nuniversal term, because it is truly predicable of all men in one and\nthe same sense, as opposed to the singular term\n\u2018Socrates\u2019, which in the same sense, i.e., when not used\nequivocally, is only predicable of one man (hence the need to add an\nordinal number to the names of kings and popes of the same name).\n\nDepending on which of these items (universal features of singular\nthings, their universal concepts, or their universal names) they\nregarded as the primary, really existing universals, it is customary\nto classify medieval authors as being realists,\nconceptualists, or nominalists, respectively. The\nrealists are supposed to be those who assert the existence of\nreal universals in and/or before particular things,\nthe conceptualists those who allow universals only, or\nprimarily, as concepts of the mind, whereas nominalists would\nbe those who would acknowledge only, or primarily, universal words.\nBut this rather crude classification does not adequately reflect the\ngenuine, much more subtle differences of opinion between medieval\nthinkers. (No wonder one often finds in the secondary literature\ndistinctions between, \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201cextreme\u201d\nversions of these crudely defined positions.) In the first place,\nnearly all medieval thinkers agreed on the existence of\nuniversals before things in the form of divine ideas existing\nin the divine\n mind,[5]\n but all of them denied their existence in the form of\nmind-independent, real, eternal entities originally posited by Plato.\nFurthermore, medieval thinkers also agreed that particular things have\ncertain features which the human mind is able to comprehend in a\nuniversal fashion, and signify by means of universal terms. As we\nshall see, their disagreements rather concerned the types of the\nrelationships that hold between the particular things, their\nindividual, yet universally comprehensible features, the universal\nconcepts of the mind, and the universal terms of our languages, as\nwell as the ontological status of, and distinctions between, the\nindividualized features of the things and the universal concepts of\nthe mind. Nevertheless, the distinction between \u201crealism\u201d\nand \u201cnominalism\u201d, especially, when it is used to refer to\nthe distinction between the radically different ways of doing\nphilosophy and theology in late-medieval times, is quite justifiable,\nprovided we clarify what really separated these ways, as I\nhope to do in the later sections of this article.\n\nIn this brief summary account, I will survey the problem both from a\nsystematic and from a historical point of view. In the next section I\nwill first motivate the problem by showing how naturally the questions\nconcerning universals emerge if we consider how we come to know a\nuniversal claim, i.e., one that concerns a potentially infinite number\nof particulars of a given kind, in a simple geometrical demonstration.\nI will also briefly indicate why a na\u00efve Platonic answer to these\nquestions in terms of the theory of perfect Forms, however plausible\nit may seem at first, is inadequate. In the third section, I will\nbriefly discuss how the specific medieval questions concerning\nuniversals emerged, especially in the context of answering\nPorphyry\u2019s famous questions in his introduction to\nAristotle\u2019s Categories, which will naturally lead us to\na discussion of Boethius\u2019 Aristotelian answers to these\nquestions in his second commentary on Porphyry in the fourth section.\nHowever, Boethius\u2019 Aristotelian answers anticipated only one\nside of the medieval discussions: the mundane, philosophical theory of\nuniversals, in terms of Aristotelian abstractionism. But the other\nimportant, Neo-Platonic, theological side of the issue provided by\nBoethius, and, most importantly, by St. Augustine, was for medieval\nthinkers the theory of ontologically primary universals as the\ncreative archetypes of the divine mind, the Divine Ideas. Therefore,\nthe fifth section is going to deal with the main ontological and\nepistemological problems generated by this theory, namely, the\napparent conflict between divine simplicity and the multiplicity of\ndivine ideas, on the one hand, and the tension between the Augustinian\ntheory of divine illumination and Aristotelian abstractionism, on the\nother. Some details of the early medieval Boethian-Aristotelian\napproach to the problem and its combination with the Neo-Platonic\nAugustinian tradition before the influx of the newly\nrecovered logical, metaphysical, and physical writings of Aristotle\nand their Arabic commentaries in the second half of the\n12th century will be taken up in the sixth section, in\nconnection with Abelard\u2019s (1079\u20131142) discussion of\nPorphyry\u2019s questions. The seventh section will discuss some\ndetails of the characteristic metaphysical approach to the problem in\nthe 13th century, especially as it was shaped by the\ninfluence of Avicenna\u2019s (980\u20131037) doctrine of common\nnature. The eighth section outlines the most general features of the\nlogical conceptual framework that served as the common background for\nthe metaphysical disagreements among the authors of this period. I\nwill argue that it is precisely this common logical-semantical\nframework that allows the grouping together of authors who endorse\nsometimes radically different metaphysics and epistemologies (not only\nin this period, but also much later, well into the early modern\nperiod) as belonging to what in later medieval philosophy came to be\nknown as the \u201crealist\u201d via antiqua, the\n\u201cold way\u201d of doing philosophy and theology. By contrast,\nit was precisely the radically different logical-semantical approach\ninitiated by William Ockham (ca. 1280\u20131350), and articulated and\nsystematized most powerfully by Jean Buridan (ca. 1300\u20131358),\nthat distinguished the \u201cnominalist\u201d via moderna,\nthe \u201cmodern way\u201d of doing philosophy and theology from the\nsecond half of the 14th century. The general, distinctive\ncharacteristics of this \u201cmodern way\u201d will be the discussed\nin the ninth section. Finally, the concluding tenth section will\nbriefly indicate how the separation of the two viae, in\naddition to a number of extrinsic social factors, contributed to the\ndisintegration of scholastic discourse, and thereby to the\ndisappearance of the characteristically medieval problem of\nuniversals, as well as to the re-mergence of recognizably the same\nproblem in different guises in early modern philosophy.\n2. The Emergence of the Problem\n\nIt is easy to see how the problem of universals emerges, if we\nconsider a geometrical demonstration, for example, the demonstration\nof Thales\u2019 theorem. According to the theorem, any triangle\ninscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle, as is shown in the\nfollowing diagram:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Thales\u2019 theorem\n\n\nLooking at this diagram, we can see that all we need to prove is that\nthe angle at vertex D of triangle ABD is a right angle. The proof is\neasy once we realize that since lines AC, DC, and BC are the radii of\na circle, the triangles ACD and DCB are isosceles triangles, whence\ntheir base angles are equal. For then, if we denote the angles of ABD\nby the names of their vertices, this fact entails that D=A + B; and\nso, since A + B + D=180o, it follows that 2A +\n2B=180o; therefore, A + B=90o, that is,\nD=90o, q. e. d.\n\nOf course, from our point of view, the important thing about this\ndemonstration is not so much the truth of its conclusion as\nthe way it proves this conclusion. For the conclusion is a\nuniversal theorem, which has to concern all possible triangles\ninscribed in any possible semicircle whatsoever, not just the one\ninscribed in the semicircle in the figure above. Yet, apparently, in\nthe demonstration above we were talking only about that triangle. So,\nhow can we claim that whatever we managed to prove concerning that\nparticular triangle will hold for all possible triangles?\n\nIf we take a closer look at the diagram, we can easily see the appeal\nof the Platonic answer to this question. For upon a closer look, it is\nclear that, despite appearances to the contrary, this demonstration\ncannot be about the triangle in this diagram. Indeed, in the\ndemonstration we assumed that the lines AC, DC, and BC were all\nperfectly equal, straight lines. However, if we zoom in on the figure,\nwe can clearly see that these lines are far from being equal; in fact,\nthey are not even straight lines:\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The result of zooming in on\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThe demonstration was certainly not about the collection of jagged\nblack surfaces that we can see here. Rather, the demonstration\nconcerned something we did not see with our bodily eyes, but what we\nhad in mind all along, understanding it to be a triangle, with\nperfectly straight edges, touching a perfect circle in three\nunextended points, which are all perfectly equidistant from the center\nof the circle. The figure we could see was only a convenient\n\u201creminder\u201d of what we are supposed to have in mind when we\nwant to prove that a certain property, namely, that it is a right\ntriangle, has to belong to the object in our mind in virtue of what it\nis, namely, a triangle inscribed in a semicircle. Obviously, the\nconclusion applies perfectly only to the perfect triangle we had in\nmind, whereas it holds for the visible figure only insofar as, and to\nthe extent that, this figure resembles the object we had in mind. But\nthis figure fails to have this property precisely insofar as, and to\nthe extent that, it falls short of the object in our mind.\n\nHowever, on the basis of this point it should also be clear that the\nconclusion does apply to this figure, and every other visible\ntriangle inscribed in a semicircle as well, insofar as, and to the\nextent that, it manages to imitate the properties of the perfect\nobject in our mind. Therefore, the Platonic answer to the question of\nwhat this demonstration was about, namely, that it was about a\nperfect, ideal triangle, which is invisible to the eyes, but is\ngraspable by our understanding, at once provides us with an\nexplanation of the possibility of universal, necessary knowledge. By\nknowing the properties of the Form or Idea, we know all its\nparticulars, i.e., all the things that imitate it, insofar as they\nimitate or participate in it. So, the Form itself is a universal\nentity, a universal model of all its particulars; and since it is the\nknowledge of this universal entity that can enable us to know at once\nall its particulars, it is absolutely vital for us to know\nwhat it is, what it is like, and exactly\nhow it is related to its particulars. However,\nobviously, all these questions presuppose that it is\nat all, namely, that such a universal entity exists.\n\nBut the existence of such an entity seems to be rather precarious.\nConsider, for instance, the perfect triangle we were supposed to have\nin mind during the demonstration of Thales\u2019 theorem. If it is a\nperfect triangle, it obviously has to have three sides, since a\nperfect triangle has to be a triangle, and nothing can be a triangle\nunless it has three sides. But of those three sides either at least\ntwo are equal or none, that is to say, the triangle in question has to\nbe either isosceles or scalene (taking \u2018isosceles\u2019\nbroadly, including even equilateral triangles, for the sake of\nsimplicity). However, since it is supposed to be the universal model\nof all triangles, and not only of isosceles triangles, this\nperfect triangle cannot be an isosceles, and for the same reason it\ncannot be a scalene triangle either. Therefore, such a universal\ntriangle would have to have inconsistent properties, namely,\nboth that it is either isosceles or scalene and that\nit is neither isosceles nor scalene. However, obviously nothing can\nhave these properties at the same time, so nothing can be a universal\ntriangle any more than a round square. So, apparently, no universal\ntriangle can exist. But then, what was our demonstration about? Just a\nlittle while ago, we concluded that it could not be directly about any\nparticular triangle (for it was not about the triangle in the figure,\nand it was even less about any other particular triangle not in the\nfigure), and now we had to conclude that it could not be about a\nuniversal triangle either. But are there any further alternatives? It\nseems obvious that through this demonstration we do gain universal\nknowledge concerning all particulars. Yet it is also clear that we do\nnot, indeed, we cannot gain this knowledge by examining all\nparticulars, both because they are potentially infinite and because\nnone of them perfectly satisfies the conditions stated in the\ndemonstration. So, there must have been something wrong in our\ncharacterization of the universal, which compelled us to conclude\nthat, in accordance with that characterization, universals could not\nexist. Therefore, we are left with a whole bundle of questions\nconcerning the nature and characteristics of universals, questions\nthat cannot be left unanswered if we want to know how universal,\nnecessary knowledge is possible, if at all.\n3. The Origin of the Specifically Medieval Problem of Universals\n\nWhat we may justifiably call the first formulation of \u201cthe\nmedieval problem of universals\u201d (distinguishing it from\nthe both logically and historically related ancient problems of\nPlato\u2019s Theory of Forms) was precisely such a bundle of\nquestions famously raised by Porphyry in his Isagoge, that\nis, his Introduction to Aristotle\u2019s Categories. As he\nwrote:\n\n(1) Since, Chrysaorius, to teach about Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories it is necessary to know what genus and difference\nare, as well as species, property, and accident, and since reflection\non these things is useful for giving definitions, and in general for\nmatters pertaining to division and demonstration, therefore I shall\ngive you a brief account and shall try in a few words, as in the\nmanner of an introduction, to go over what our elders said about these\nthings. I shall abstain from deeper enquiries and aim, as appropriate,\nat the simpler ones.\n\n\n(2) For example, I shall beg off saying anything about (a) whether\ngenera and species are real or are situated in bare thoughts alone,\n(b) whether as real they are bodies or incorporeals, and (c) whether\nthey are separated or in sensibles and have their reality in\nconnection with them. Such business is profound, and requires another,\ngreater investigation. Instead I shall now try to show how the\nancients, the Peripatetics among them most of all, interpreted genus\nand species and the other matters before us in a more logical fashion.\n[Porphyry, Isagoge, in Spade 1994 (henceforth, Five\nTexts), p. 1.]\n\n\nEven though in this way, by relegating them to a \u201cgreater\ninvestigation\u201d, Porphyry left these questions unanswered, they\ncertainly proved to be irresistible for his medieval Latin\ncommentators, beginning with Boethius, who produced not just one, but\ntwo commentaries on Porphyry\u2019s text; the first based on Marius\nVictorinus\u2019s (fl. 4th c.) translation, and\nthe second on his\n own.[6]\n\nIn the course of his argument, Boethius makes it quite clear what sort\nof entity a universal would have to be.\n\nA universal must be common to several particulars\n\n\nin its entirety, and not only in part\nsimultaneously, and not in a temporal succession, and\nit should constitute the substance of its\n particulars.[7]\n\n\n\nHowever, as Boethius argues, nothing in real existence can satisfy\nthese conditions. The main points of his argument can be reconstructed\nas follows.\n\nAnything that is common to many things in the required manner has to\nbe simultaneously, and as a whole, in the substance of these many\nthings. But these many things are several beings precisely because\nthey are distinct from one another in their being, that is to say, the\nact of being of one is distinct from the act of being of the other.\nHowever, if the universal constitutes the substance of a particular,\nthen it has to have the same act of being as the particular, because\nconstituting the substance of something means precisely this, namely,\nsharing the act of being of the thing in question, as the\nthing\u2019s substantial part. But the universal is supposed to\nconstitute the substance of all of its distinct particulars, as a\nwhole, at the same time. Therefore, the one act of being of the\nuniversal entity would have to be identical with all the distinct acts\nof being of its several particulars at the same time, which is\n impossible.[8]\n\nThis argument, therefore, establishes that no one thing can be a\nuniversal in its being, that is to say, nothing can be both one being\nand common to many beings in such a manner that it shares its act of\nbeing with those many beings, constituting their substance.\n\nThis can easily be visualized in the following diagram, where the tiny\nlightning bolts indicate the acts of being of the entities involved,\nnamely, a woman, a man, and their universal humanity (the larger\ndotted figure).\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the first part\nof Boethius\u2019 argument\n\n\nBut then, Boethius goes on, we should perhaps say that the universal\nis not one being, but rather many beings, that is, [the collection\n of][9]\n those constituents of the individual essences of its particulars on\naccount of which they all fall under the same universal predicable.\nFor example, on this conception, the genus \u2018animal\u2019 would\nnot be some one entity, a universal animality over and above the\nindividual animals, yet somehow sharing its being with them all\n(since, as we have just seen, that is impossible), but rather [the\ncollection of] the individual animalities of all animals.\n\nBoethius rejects this suggestion on the ground that whenever there are\nseveral generically similar entities, they have to have a genus;\ntherefore, just as the individual animals had to have a genus, so too,\ntheir individual animalities would have to have another one. However,\nsince the genus of animalities cannot be one entity, some\n\u2018super-animality\u2019 (for the same reason that the genus of\nanimals could not be one entity, on the basis of the previous\nargument), it seems that the genus of animalities would have to be a\nnumber of further \u2018super-animalities\u2019. But then again, the\nsame line of reasoning should apply to these\n\u2018super-animalities\u2019, giving rise to a number of\n\u2018super-super-animalities\u2019, and so on to infinity, which is\nabsurd. Therefore, we cannot regard the genus as some real being even\nin the form of [a collection of] several distinct entities. Since\nsimilar reasonings would apply to the other Porphyrian predicables as\nwell, no universal can exist in this way.\n\nNow, a universal either exists in reality independently of a mind\nconceiving of it, or it only exists in the mind. If it exists in\nreality, then it either has to be one being or several beings. But\nsince it cannot exist in reality in either of these two ways, Boethius\nconcludes that it can only exist in the\n mind.[10]\n\nHowever, to complicate matters, it appears that a universal cannot\nexist in the mind either. For, as Boethius says, the universal\nexisting in the mind is some universal understanding of some thing\noutside the mind. But then this universal understanding is either\ndisposed in the same way as the thing is, or differently. If it is\ndisposed in the same way, then the thing also must be universal, and\nthen we end up with the previous problem of a really existing\nuniversal. On the other hand, if it is disposed differently, then it\nis false, for \u201cwhat is understood otherwise than the thing is is\nfalse\u201d (Five Texts, Spade 1994, p. 23 (21)). But then,\nall universals in the understanding would have to be false\nrepresentations of their objects; therefore, no universal knowledge\nwould be possible, whereas our considerations started out precisely\nfrom the existence of such knowledge, as seems to be clear, e.g., in\nthe case of geometrical knowledge.\n4. Boethius\u2019 Aristotelian Solution\n\nBoethius\u2019 solution of the problem stated in this form consists\nin the rejection of this last argument, by pointing out the ambiguity\nof the principle that \u201cwhat is understood otherwise than the\nthing is is false\u201d. For in one sense this principle states the\nobvious, namely, that an act of understanding that represents a thing\nto be otherwise than the thing is is false. This is\nprecisely the reading of this principle that renders it plausible.\nHowever, in another sense this principle would state that an act of\nunderstanding which represents the thing in a manner which is\ndifferent from the manner in which the thing exists is false. In this\nsense, then, the principle would state that if the mode of\nrepresentation of the act of understanding is different from the mode\nof being of the thing, then the act of understanding is false. But\nthis is far from plausible. In general, it is simply not true that a\nrepresentation can be true or faithful only if the mode of\nrepresentation matches the mode of being of the thing represented. For\nexample, a written sentence is a true and faithful representation of a\nspoken sentence, although the written sentence is a visible, spatial\nsequence of characters, whereas the spoken sentence is an audible,\ntemporal pattern of articulated sounds. So, what exists as an audible\npattern of sounds is represented visually, that is, the mode of\nexistence of the thing represented is radically different from the\nmode of its representation. In the same way, when particular things\nare represented by a universal act of thought, the things exist in a\nparticular manner, while they are represented in a universal manner,\nstill, this need not imply that the representation is false. But this\nis precisely the sense of the principle that the objection exploited.\nTherefore, since in this sense the principle can be rejected, the\nobjection is not\n conclusive.[11]\n\nHowever, it still needs to be shown that in the particular case of\nuniversal representation the mismatch between the mode of its\nrepresentation and the mode of being of the thing represented does in\nfact not entail the falsity of the representation. This can easily be\nseen if we consider the fact that the falsity of an act of\nunderstanding consists in representing something to be in a\nway it is not. That is to say, properly speaking, it is only an act of\njudgment that can be false, by which we think something\nto be somehow. But a simple act of understanding, by\nwhich we simply understand something without thinking it to\nbe somehow, that is, without attributing anything to it, cannot\nbe false. For example, I can be mistaken if I form in my mind the\njudgment that a man is running, whereby I conceive a man\nto be somehow, but if I simply think of a man without\nattributing either running or not running to him, I certainly cannot\nmake a mistake as to how he\n is.[12]\n In the same way, I would be mistaken if I were to think that a\ntriangle is neither isosceles nor scalene, but I am certainly not in\nerror if I simply think of a triangle without thinking either that it\nis isosceles or that it is scalene. Indeed, it is precisely this\npossibility that allows me to form the universal mental\nrepresentation, that is, the universal concept of all particular\ntriangles, regardless of whether they are isosceles or scalene. For\nwhen I think of a triangle in general, then I certainly do not think\nof something that is a triangle and is neither isosceles nor scalene,\nfor that is impossible, but I simply think of a triangle, not thinking\nthat it is an isosceles and not thinking that it is a scalene\ntriangle. This is how the mind is able to separate in thought what are\ninseparable in real existence. Being either isosceles or scalene is\ninseparable from a triangle in real existence. For it is impossible\nfor something to be a triangle, and yet not to be an\nisosceles and not to be a scalene triangle either.\nStill, it is not impossible for something to be thought to be\na triangle and not to be thought to be an isosceles\nand not to be thought to be a scalene triangle\neither (although of course, it still has to be thought to be\neither-isosceles-or-scalene). This separation in thought of those\nthings that cannot be separated in reality is the process of\n abstraction.[13]\n In general, by means of the process of abstraction, our mind (in\nparticular, the faculty of our mind Aristotle calls active\nintellect (nous poietikos, in Greek, intellectus\nagens, in Latin) is able to form universal representations of\nparticular objects by disregarding what distinguishes them, and\nconceiving of them only in terms of those of their features in respect\nof which they do not differ from one another.\n\nIn this way, therefore, if universals are regarded as universal mental\nrepresentations existing in the mind, then the contradictions emerging\nfrom the Platonic conception no longer pose a threat. On this\nAristotelian conception, universals need not be thought of as somehow\nsharing their being with all their distinct particulars, for their\nbeing simply consists in their being thought of, or rather, the\nparticulars\u2019 being thought of in a universal manner. This is\nwhat Boethius expresses by saying in his final replies to\nPorphyry\u2019s questions the following:\n\n\n\u2026 genera and species subsist in one way, but are understood in\nan another. They are incorporeal, but subsist in sensibles, joined to\nsensibles. They are understood, however, as subsisting by themselves,\nand as not having their being in others. [Five Texts, Spade\n1994, p. 25]\n\n\nBut then, if in this way, by positing universals in the mind, the most\nobvious inconsistencies of Plato\u2019s doctrine can be avoided, no\nwonder that Plato\u2019s \u201coriginal\u201d universals, the\nuniversal models which particulars try to imitate by their features,\nfound their place, in accordance with the long-standing Neo-Platonic\ntradition, in the divine\n mind.[14]\n It is this tradition that explains Boethius\u2019 cautious\nformulation of his conclusion concerning Aristotelianism pure and\nsimple, as not providing us with the whole story. As he writes:\n\n\n\u2026 Plato thinks that genera and species and the rest are not\nonly understood as universals, but also exist and subsist apart from\nbodies. Aristotle, however, thinks that they are understood as\nincorporeal and universal, but subsist in sensibles.\n\nI did not regard it as appropriate to decide between their views. For\nthat belongs to a higher philosophy. But we have carefully followed\nout Aristotle\u2019s view here, not because we would recommend it the\nmost, but because this book, [the Isagoge], is written about\nthe Categories, of which Aristotle is the author. [Five\nTexts, Spade 1994, p. 25]\n\n5. Platonic Forms as Divine Ideas\n\nBesides Boethius, the most important mediator between the Neo-Platonic\nphilosophical tradition and the Christianity of the Medieval Latin\nWest, pointing out also its theological implications, was St.\nAugustine. In a passage often quoted by medieval authors in their\ndiscussions of divine ideas, he writes as follows:\n\n\n\u2026 in Latin we can call the Ideas \u201cforms\u201d or\n\u201cspecies\u201d, in order to appear to translate word for word.\nBut if we call them \u201creasons\u201d, we depart to be sure from a\nproper translation \u2014 for reasons are called \u201clogoi\u201d\nin Greek, not Ideas \u2014 but nevertheless, whoever wants to use\nthis word will not be in conflict with the fact. For Ideas are certain\nprincipal, stable and immutable forms or reasons of things. They are\nnot themselves formed, and hence they are eternal and always stand in\nthe same relations, and they are contained in the divine\nunderstanding. [Spade 1985, Other Internet Resources, p.\n 383][15]\n\n\nAs we could see from Boethius\u2019 solution, in this way, if\nPlatonic Forms are not universal beings existing in a universal\nmanner, but their universality is due to a universal manner of\nunderstanding, we can avoid the contradictions arising from the\n\u201cna\u00efve\u201d Platonic conception. Nevertheless, placing\nuniversal ideas in the divine mind as the archetypes of creation, this\nconception can still do justice to the Platonic intuition that what\naccounts for the necessary, universal features of the ephemeral\nparticulars of the visible world is the presence of some universal\nexemplars in the source of their being. It is precisely in virtue of\nhaving some insight into these exemplars themselves that we can have\nthe basis of universal knowledge Plato was looking for. As St.\nAugustine continues:\n\n\nAnd although they neither arise nor perish, nevertheless everything\nthat is able to arise and perish, and everything that does arise and\nperish, is said to be formed in accordance with them. Now it is denied\nthat the soul can look upon them, unless it is a rational one, [and\neven then it can do so] only by that part of itself by which it\nsurpasses [other things] \u2014 that is, by its mind and reason, as\nif by a certain \u201cface\u201d, or by an inner and intelligible\n\u201ceye\u201d. To be sure, not each and every rational soul in\nitself, but [only] the one that is holy and pure, that [is the one\nthat] is claimed to be fit for such a vision, that is, the one that\nkeeps that very eye, by which these things are seen, healthy and pure\nand fair and like the things it means to see. What devout man imbued\nwith true religion, even though he is not yet able to see these\nthings, nevertheless dares to deny, or for that matter fails to\nprofess, that all things that exist, that is, whatever things are\ncontained in their own genus with a certain nature of their own, so\nthat that they might exist, are begotten by God their author, and that\nby that same author everything that lives is alive, and that the\nentire safe preservation and the very order of things, by which\nchanging things repeat their temporal courses according to a fixed\nregimen, are held together and governed by the laws of a supreme God?\nIf this is established and granted, who dares to say that God has set\nup all things in an irrational manner? Now if it is not correct to say\nor believe this, it remains that all things are set up by reason, and\na man not by the same reason as a horse \u2014 for that is absurd to\nsuppose. Therefore, single things are created with their own reasons.\nBut where are we to think these reasons exist, if not in the mind of\nthe creator? For he did not look outside himself, to anything placed\n[there], in order to set up what he set up. To think that is\nsacrilege. But if these reasons of all things to be created and\n[already] created are contained in the divine mind, and [if] there\ncannot be anything in the divine mind that is not eternal and\nunchangeable, and [if] Plato calls these principal reasons of things\n\u201cIdeas\u201d, [then] not only are there Ideas but they are\ntrue, because they are eternal and [always] stay the same way, and\n[are] unchangeable. And whatever exists comes to exist, however it\nexists, by participation in them. But among the things set up by God,\nthe rational soul surpasses all [others], and is closest to God when\nit is pure. And to the extent that it clings to God in charity, to\nthat extent, drenched in a certain way and lit up by that intelligible\nlight, it discerns these reasons, not by bodily eyes but by that\nprincipal [part] of it by which it surpasses [everything else], that\nis, by its intelligence. By this vision it becomes most blessed. These\nreasons, as was said, whether it is right to call them Ideas or forms\nor species or reasons, many are permitted to call [them] whatever they\nwant, but [only] to a very few [is it permitted] to see what is true.\n[Spade 1985, Other Internet Resources, pp. 383\u2013384]\n\n\nAugustine\u2019s conception, then, saves Plato\u2019s original\nintuitions, yet without their inconsistencies, while it also combines\nhis philosophical insights with Christianity. But, as a rule, a really\nintriguing solution of a philosophical problem usually gives rise to a\nnumber of further problems. This solution of the original problem with\nPlato\u2019s Forms is no exception.\n5.1 Divine Ideas and Divine Simplicity\n\nFirst of all, it generates a particular ontological/theological\nproblem concerning the relationship between God and His Ideas. For\naccording to the traditional philosophical conception of divine\nperfection, God\u2019s perfection demands that He is absolutely\nsimple, without any composition of any sort of\n parts.[16]\n So, God and the divine mind are not related to one another as a man\nand his mind, namely as a substance to one of its several powers, but\nwhatever powers God has He is. Furthermore, the\nDivine Ideas themselves cannot be regarded as being somehow the\neternal products of the divine mind distinct from the divine mind, and\nthus from God Himself, for the only eternal being is God, and\neverything else is His creature. Now, since the Ideas are not\ncreatures, but the archetypes of creatures in God\u2019s mind, they\ncannot be distinct from God. However, as is clear from the passage\nabove, there are several Ideas, and there is only one God. So how can\nthese several Ideas possibly be one and the same God?\n\nAugustine never explicitly raised the problem, but for example\nAquinas, who (among others) did, provided the following rather\nintuitive solution for it (ST1, q. 15, a. 2). The Divine Ideas are in\nthe Divine Mind as its objects, i.e., as the things understood. But\nthe diversity of the objects of an act of understanding need not\ndiversify the act itself (as when understanding the Pythagorean\ntheorem, we understand both squares and triangles). Therefore, it is\npossible for the self-thinking divine essence to understand itself in\na single act of understanding so perfectly that this act of\nunderstanding not only understands the divine essence as it is in\nitself, but also in respect of all possible ways in which it can be\nimperfectly participated by any finite creature. The cognition of the\ndiversity of these diverse ways of participation accounts for the\nplurality of divine ideas. But since all these diverse ways are\nunderstood in a single eternal act of understanding, which is nothing\nbut the act of divine being, and which in turn is again the divine\nessence itself, the multiplicity of ideas does not entail any\ncorresponding multiplicity of the divine essence. To be sure, this\nsolution may still give rise to the further questions as to what these\ndiverse ways are, exactly how they are related to the divine essence,\nand how their diversity is compatible with the unity and simplicity of\nthe ultimate object of divine thought, namely, divine essence itself.\nIn fact, these are questions that were raised and discussed in detail\nby authors such as Henry of Ghent (c. 1217\u20131293), Thomas of\nSutton (ca. 1250\u20131315), Duns Scotus (c. 1266\u20131308) and\n others.[17]\n5.2 Illuminationism vs. Abstractionism\n\nAnother major issue connected to the doctrine of divine ideas, as\nshould also be clear from the previously quoted passage, was the\nbundle of epistemological questions involved in Augustine\u2019s\ndoctrine of divine illumination. The doctrine \u2014 according to\nwhich the human soul, especially \u201cone that is holy and\npure\u201d, obtains a specific supernatural aid in its acts of\nunderstanding, by gaining a direct insight into the Divine Ideas\nthemselves \u2014 received philosophical support in terms of a\ntypically Platonic argument in Augustine\u2019s De Libero\n Arbitrio.[18]\n The argument can be reconstructed as follows.\n\nThe Augustinian Argument for Illumination.\n\n\nI can come to know from experience only something that can be\nfound in experience [self-evident]\nAbsolute unity cannot be found in experience [assumed]\nTherefore, I cannot come to know absolute unity from experience.\n[1,2]\nWhatever I know, but I cannot come to know from experience, I came\nto know from a source that is not in this world of experiences.\n[self-evident]\nI know absolute unity. [assumed]\nTherefore, I came to know absolute unity from a source that is not\nin this world of experiences. [3,4,5]\n\n\nProof of 2. Whatever can be found in experience is some\nmaterial being, extended in space, and so it has to have a multitude\nof spatially distinct parts. Therefore, it is many in respect of those\nparts. But what is many in some respect is not one in that respect,\nand what is not one in some respect is not absolutely one. Therefore,\nnothing can be found in experience that is absolutely one, that is,\nnothing in experience is an absolute unity.\n\nProof of 5. I know that whatever is given in experience has\nmany parts (even if I may not be able to discern those parts by my\nsenses), and so I know that it is not an absolute unity. But I can\nhave this knowledge only if I know absolute unity, namely, something\nthat is not many in any respect, not even in respect of its parts,\nfor, in general, I can know that something is F in a certain respect,\nand not an F in some other respect, only if I know what it is for\nsomething to be an F without any qualification. (For example, I know\nthat the two halves of a body, taken together, are not absolutely two,\nfor taken one by one, they are not absolutely one, since they are also\ndivisible into two halves, etc. But I can know this only because I\nknow that for obtaining absolutely two things [and not just two\nmultitudes of further things], I would have to have two things that in\nthemselves are absolutely one.) Therefore, I know absolute unity.\n\n\nIt is important to notice here that this argument (crucially) assumes\nthat the intellect is passive in acquiring its concepts. According to\nthis assumption, the intellect merely receives the cognition of its\nobjects as it finds them. By contrast, on the Aristotelian conception,\nthe human mind actively processes the information it receives from\nexperience through the senses. So by means of its faculty\nappropriately called the active or agent intellect, it is able to\nproduce from a limited number of experiences a universal concept\nequally representing all possible particulars falling under that\nconcept. In his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De Anima\nAquinas insightfully remarks:\n\n\nThe reason why Aristotle came to postulate an active intellect was his\nrejection of Plato\u2019s theory that the essences of sensible things\nexisted apart from matter, in a state of actual intelligibility. For\nPlato there was clearly no need to posit an active intellect. But\nAristotle, who regarded the essences of sensible things as existing in\nmatter with only a potential intelligibility, had to invoke some\nabstractive principle in the mind itself to render these essences\nactually intelligible. [In De Anima, bk. 3, lc. 10]\n\n\nOn the basis of these and similar considerations, therefore, one may\nconstruct a rather plausible Aristotelian counterargument, which is\ndesigned to show that we need not necessarily gain our concept of\nabsolute unity from a supernatural source, for it is possible for us\nto obtain it from experience by means of the active intellect. Of\ncourse, similar considerations should apply to other concepts as\nwell.\n\nAn Aristotelian-Thomistic counterargument from\nabstraction.\n\n\nI know from experience everything whose concept my active\nintellect is able to abstract from experience. [self-evident]\nBut my active intellect is able to abstract from experience the\nconcept of unity, since we all experience each singular thing as being\none, distinct from another. [self-evident, common\n experience][19]\nTherefore, I know unity from experience by abstraction. [1,2]\nWhenever I know something from experience by abstraction, I know\nboth the thing whose concept is abstracted and its limiting conditions\nfrom which its concept is abstracted. [self-evident]\nTherefore, I know both unity and its limiting conditions from\nwhich its concept is abstracted. [3,4]\nBut whenever I know something and its limiting conditions, and I\ncan conceive of it without its limiting conditions (and this is\nprecisely what happens in abstraction), I can conceive of its\nabsolute, unlimited realization. [self-evident]\nTherefore, I can conceive of the absolute, unlimited realization\nof unity, based on the concept of unity I acquired from experience by\nabstraction. [5,6]\nTherefore, it is not necessary for me to have a preliminary\nknowledge of absolute unity before all experience, from a source other\nthan this world of experiences. [7]\n\n\n\nTo be sure, we should notice here that this argument does\nnot falsify the doctrine of illumination.\nProvided it works, it only invalidates the\nAugustinian-Platonic argument for illumination. Furthermore,\nthis is obviously not a sweeping, knock-down refutation of the idea\nthat at least some of our concepts perhaps could not so simply be\nderived from experience by abstraction; in fact, in the particular\ncase of unity, and in general, in connection with our transcendental\nnotions (i.e., notions that apply in each Aristotelian category, so\nthey transcend the limits of each one of them, such as the\nnotions of being, unity, goodness,\ntruth, etc.), even the otherwise consistently Aristotelian\nAquinas would have a more complicated story to tell (see Klima 2000b).\nNevertheless, although Aquinas would still leave some room for\nillumination in his epistemology, he would provide for illumination an\nentirely naturalistic interpretation, as far as the acquisition of our\nintellectual concepts of material things is concerned, by simply\nidentifying it with the \u201cintellectual light in us\u201d, that\nis, the active intellect, which enables us to acquire these concepts\nfrom experience by\n abstraction.[20]\n Duns Scotus, who opposed Aquinas on so many other points, takes\nbasically the same stance on this issue. Other medieval theologians,\nespecially such prominent \u201cAugustinians\u201d as Bonaventure,\nMatthew of Aquasparta, or Henry of Ghent, would provide greater room\nfor illumination in the form of a direct, specific, supernatural\ninfluence needed for human intellectual cognition in this life besides\nthe general divine cooperation needed for the workings of our natural\npowers, in particular, the abstractive function of the active\n intellect.[21]\n But they would not regard illumination as supplanting, but rather as\nsupplementing intellectual abstraction.\n\nAs we could see, Augustine makes recognition of truth dependent on\ndivine illumination, a sort of irradiation of the intelligible light\nof divine ideas, which is accessible only to the few who are\n\u201choly and pure\u201d.\n\nBut this seems to go against at least\n\n\n1. the experience that there are knowledgeable non-believers or\npagans\n\n2. the Aristotelian insight that we can have infallible comprehension\nof the first principles of scientific demonstrations for which we only\nneed the intellectual concepts that we can acquire naturally, from\nexperience by\n abstraction,[22]\n\n\nand\n\n\n3. the philosophical-theological consideration that if human reason,\nman\u2019s natural faculty for acquiring truth were not sufficient\nfor performing its natural function, then human nature would be\nnaturally defective in its noblest part, precisely in which it was\ncreated after the image of God.\n\n\nIn fact, these are only some of the problems explicitly raised and\nconsidered by medieval Augustinians, which prompted their ever more\nrefined accounts of the role of illumination in human cognition.\n\nFor example, Matthew of Aquasparta, recapitulating St. Bonaventure,\nwrites as follows:\n\n\nPlato and his followers stated that the entire essence of cognition\ncomes forth from the archetypal or intelligible world, and from the\nideal reasons; and they stated that the eternal light contributes to\ncertain cognition in its evidentness as the entire and sole reason for\ncognition, as Augustine in many places recites, in particular in bk.\nviii. c. 7 of The City of God: \u2018The light of minds for\nthe cognition of everything is God himself, who created\neverything\u2019.\n\nBut this position is entirely mistaken. For although it appears to\nsecure the way of wisdom, it destroys the way of knowledge.\nFurthermore, if that light were the entire and sole reason for\ncognition, then the cognition of things in the Word would not differ\nfrom their cognition in their proper kind, neither would the cognition\nof reason differ from the cognition of revelation, nor philosophical\ncognition from prophetic cognition, nor cognition by nature from\ncognition by grace.\n\nThe other position was apparently that of Aristotle, who claimed that\nthe entire essence of cognition is caused and comes from below,\nthrough the senses, memory, and experience, [working together] with\nthe natural light of our active intellect, which abstracts the species\nfrom phantasms and makes them actually understood. And for this reason\nhe did not claim that the eternal is light necessary for cognition,\nindeed, he never spoke about it. And this opinion of his is obvious in\nbk. 2 of the Posterior Analytics. [\u2026]\n\nBut this position seems to be very deficient. For although it builds\nthe way of knowledge, it totally destroys the way of wisdom.\n[\u2026]\n\nTherefore, I take it that one should maintain an intermediate position\nwithout prejudice, by stating that our cognition is caused both from\nbelow and from above, from external things as well as the ideal\nreasons.\n\n[\u2026] God has provided our mind with some intellectual light, by\nmeans of which it would abstract the species of objects from the\nsensibles, by purifying them and extracting their quiddities, which\nare the per se objects of the intellect. [\u2026] But this light is\nnot sufficient, for it is defective, and is mixed with obscurity,\nunless it is joined and connected to the eternal light, which is the\nperfect and sufficient reason for cognition, and the intellect attains\nand somehow touches it by its upper part.\n\nHowever the intellect attains that light or those eternal reasons as\nthe reason for cognition not as sole reason, for then, as has been\nsaid, cognition in the Word would not differ from cognition in proper\nkind, nor the cognition of wisdom would differ from the cognition of\nknowledge. Nor does it attain them as the entire reason, for then it\nwould not need the species and similitudes of things; but this is\nfalse, for the Philosopher says, and experience teaches, that if\nsomeone loses a sense, then he loses that knowledge of things which\ncomes from that sense. [DHCR, pp. 94\u201396]\n\n\nIn this way, taking the intermediate position between Platonism and\nAristotelianism pure and simple, Matthew interprets Augustine\u2019s\nPlatonism as being compatible with the Aristotelian view, crediting\nthe Aristotelian position with accounting for the specific empirical\ncontent of our intellectual concepts, while crediting the Platonic\nview with accounting for their certainty in grasping the natures of\nthings. Still, it may not appear quite clear exactly what the\ncontribution of the eternal light is, indeed, whether it is necessary\nat all. After all, if by abstraction we manage to gain those\nintellectual concepts that represent the natures of things, what else\nis needed to have a grasp of those natures?\n\nHenry of Ghent, in his detailed account of the issue, provides an\ninteresting answer to this question. Henry first distinguishes\ncognition of a true thing from the cognition of the truth of the\nthing. Since any really existing thing is truly what it is (even if it\nmay on occasion appear something else), any cognition of any really\nexisting thing is the cognition of a true thing. But cognition of a\ntrue thing may occur without the cognition of its truth, since the\nlatter is the cognition that the thing adequately corresponds to its\nexemplar in the human or divine mind. For example, if I draw a circle,\nwhen a cat sees it, then it sees the real true thing as it is\npresented to it. Yet the cat is simply unable to judge whether it is a\ntrue circle in the sense that it really is what it is supposed to be,\nnamely, a locus of points equidistant from a given point. By contrast,\na human being is able to judge the truth of this thing, insofar as he\nor she would be able to tell that my drawing is not really and truly a\ncircle, but is at best a good approximation of what a true circle\nwould be.\n\nNow, in intellectual cognition, just as in the sensory cognition of\nthings, when the intellect simply apprehends a true thing, then it\nstill does not have to judge the truth of the thing, even though it\nmay have a true apprehension, adequately representing the thing. But\nthe cognition of the truth of the thing only occurs in a judgment,\nwhen the intellect judges the adequacy of the thing to its\nexemplar.\n\nBut since a thing can be compared to two sorts of exemplar, namely, to\nthe exemplar in the human mind, and to the exemplar in the divine\nmind, the cognition of the truth of a thing is twofold, relative to\nthese two exemplars. The exemplar of the human mind, according to\nHenry, is nothing but the Aristotelian abstract concept of the thing,\nwhereby the thing is simply apprehended in a universal manner, and\nhence its truth is judged relative to this concept, when the intellect\njudges that the thing in question falls under this concept or not. As\nHenry writes:\n\n\n[\u2026] attending to the exemplar gained from the thing as the\nreason for its cognition in the cognizer, the truth of the thing can\nindeed be recognized, by forming a concept of the thing that conforms\nto that exemplar; and it is in this way that Aristotle asserted that\nman gains knowledge and cognition of the truth from purely natural\nsources about changeable natural things, and that this exemplar is\nacquired from things by means of the senses, as from the first\nprinciple of art and science. [\u2026] So, by means of the universal\nnotion in us that we have acquired from the several species of animals\nwe are able to realize concerning any thing that comes our way whether\nit is an animal or not, and by means of the specific notion of donkey\nwe realize concerning any thing that comes our way whether it is a\ndonkey or not. [HQO, a. 1, q. 2, fol. 5 E-F]\n\n\nBut this sort of cognition of the truth of a thing, although it is\nintellectual, universal cognition, is far from being the infallible\nknowledge we are seeking. As Henry argues further:\n\n\nBut by this sort of acquired exemplar in us we do not have the\nentirely certain and infallible cognition of truth. Indeed, this is\nentirely impossible for three reasons, the first of which is taken\nfrom the thing from which this exemplar is abstracted, the second from\nthe soul, in which this exemplar is received, and the third from the\nexemplar itself that is received in the soul about the thing.\n\nThe first reason is that this exemplar, since it is abstracted from\nchangeable things, has to share in the nature of changeability.\nTherefore, since physical things are more changeable than mathematical\nobjects, this is why the Philosopher claimed that we have a greater\ncertainty of knowledge about mathematical objects than about physical\nthings by means of their universal species. And this is why Augustine,\ndiscussing this cause of the uncertainty of the knowledge of natural\nthings in q. 9 of his Eighty-Three Different Questions, says\nthat from the bodily senses one should not expect the pure truth\n[syncera veritas]\n\n\u2026 The second reason is that the human soul, since it is\nchangeable and susceptible to error, cannot be rectified to save it\nfrom swerving into error by anything that is just as changeable as\nitself, or even more; therefore, any exemplar that it receives from\nnatural things is necessarily just as changeable as itself, or even\nmore, since it is of an inferior nature, whence it cannot rectify the\nsoul so that it would persist in the infallible truth.\n\n\u2026 The third reason is that this sort of exemplar, since it is\nthe intention and species of the sensible thing abstracted from the\nphantasm, is similar to the false as well as to the true [thing], so\nthat on its account these cannot be distinguished. For it is by means\nof the same images of sensible things that in dreams and madness we\njudge these images to be the things, and in sane awareness we judge\nthe things themselves. But the pure truth can only be perceived by\ndiscerning it from falsehood. Therefore, by means of such an exemplar\nit is impossible to have certain knowledge, and certain cognition of\nthe truth. And so if we are to have certain knowledge of the truth,\nthen we have to turn our mind away from the senses and sensible\nthings, and from every intention, no matter how universal and\nabstracted from sensible things, to the unchangeable truth existing\nabove the mind [\u2026]. [ibid., fol. 5. F]\n\n\nSo, Henry first distinguished between the cognition of a true thing\nand the intellectual cognition of the truth of a thing, and then,\nconcerning the cognition of the truth of the thing, he distinguished\nbetween the cognition of truth by means of a concept abstracted from\nthe thing and \u201cthe pure truth\u201d [veritas syncera vel\nliquida], which he says cannot be obtained by means of such\nabstracted concepts.\n\nBut then the question naturally arises: what is this \u201cpure\ntruth\u201d, and how can it be obtained, if at all? Since cognition\nof the pure truth involves comparison of objects not to their acquired\nexemplar in the human mind, but to their eternal exemplar in the\ndivine mind, in the ideal case it would consist in some sort of direct\ninsight into the divine ideas, enabling the person who has this access\nto see everything in its true form, as \u201cGod meant it to\nbe\u201d, and also see how it fails to live up to its idea due to its\ndefects. So, it would be like the direct intuition of two objects, one\nsensible, another intelligible, on the basis of which one could also\nimmediately judge how closely the former approaches the latter. But\nthis sort of direct intuition of the divine ideas is only the share of\nangels and the souls of the blessed in beatific vision; it is\ngenerally not granted in this life, except in rare, miraculous cases,\nin rapture, or prophetic vision.\n\nTherefore, if there is to be any non-miraculous recognition of this\npure truth in this life, then it has to occur differently. Henry\nargues that even if we do not have a direct intuition of divine ideas\nas the objects cognized (whereby their particulars are recognized as\nmore or less approximating them), we do have the cognition of the\nquiddities of things as the objects cognized by reason of some\nindirect cognition of their ideas. The reason for this, Henry says, is\nthe following:\n\n\n\u2026for our concept to be true by the pure truth, the soul,\ninsofar as it is informed by it, has to be similar to the truth of the\nthing outside, since truth is a certain adequacy of the thing and the\nintellect. And so, as Augustine says in bk. 2 of On Free Choice of\nthe Will, since the soul by itself is liable to slip from truth\ninto falsity, whence by itself it is not informed by the truth of any\nthing, although it can be informed by it, but nothing can inform\nitself, for nothing can give what it does not have; therefore, it is\nnecessary that it be informed of the pure truth of a thing by\nsomething else. But this cannot be done by the exemplar received from\nthe thing itself, as has been shown earlier [in the previously quoted\npassage \u2014 GK]. It is necessary, therefore, that it be informed\nby the exemplar of the unchangeable truth, as Augustine intends in the\nsame place. And this is why he says in On True Religion that\njust as by its truth are true those that are true, so too by its\nsimilitude are similar those that are similar. It is necessary,\ntherefore, that the unchangeable truth impress itself into our\nconcept, and that it transform our concept to its own character, and\nthat in this way it inform our mind with the expressed truth of the\nthing by the same similitude that the thing itself has in the first\ntruth. [HQO a. 1, q. 2, fol. 7, I]\n\n\nSo, when we have the cognition of the pure truth of a thing, then we\ncannot have it in terms of the concept acquired from the thing, yet,\nsince we cannot have it from a direct intuition of the divine exemplar\neither, the way we can have it is that the acquired concept primarily\nimpressed on our mind will be further clarified, but no longer by a\nsimilarity of the thing, but by the similarity of the divine exemplar\nitself. Henry\u2019s point seems to be that given that the external\nthing itself is already just a (more or less defective) copy of the\nexemplar, the (more or less defective) copy of this copy can only be\nimproved by means of the original exemplar, just as a copy of a poor\nrepro of some original picture can only be improved by retouching the\ncopy not on the basis of the poor repro, but on the basis of the\noriginal. But since the external thing is fashioned after its divine\nidea, the \u201cretouching\u201d of the concept in terms of the\noriginal idea does yield a better representation of the thing; indeed,\nso much better that on the basis of this \u201cretouched\u201d\nconcept we are even able to judge just how well the thing realizes its\nkind.\n\nFor example, when I simply have the initial simple concept of circle\nabstracted from circular objects I have seen, that concept is good\nenough for me to tell circular objects apart from non-circular ones.\nBut with this simple, unanalyzed concept in mind, I may still not be\nable to say what a true circle is supposed to be, and accordingly,\nexactly how and to what extent the more or less circular objects I see\nfail or meet this standard. However, when I come to understand that a\ncircle is a locus of points equidistant from a given point, I will\nrealize by means of a clear and distinct concept what it was that I\noriginally conceived in a vague and confused manner in my original\nconcept of\n circle.[23]\n\nTo be sure, I do not come to this definition of circle by looking up\nto the heaven of Ideas; in fact, I may just be instructed about it by\nmy geometry teacher. But what is not given to me by my geometry\nteacher is the understanding of the fact that what is expressed by the\ndefinition is indeed what I originally rather vaguely conceived by my\nconcept abstracted from visible circles. This \u201cflash\u201d of\nunderstanding, when I realize that it is necessary for anything that\ntruly matches the concept of a circle to be such as described in the\ndefinition, would be an instance of receiving illumination without any\nparticular, miraculous\n revelation.[24]\n\nHowever, even if in this light Henry\u2019s distinctions between the\ntwo kinds of truths and the corresponding differences of concepts make\ngood sense, and even if we accept that the concepts primarily accepted\nfrom sensible objects need to be further worked on in order to provide\nus with true, clear understanding of the natures of things, it is not\nclear that this further work cannot be done by the natural faculties\nof our mind, assuming only the general influence of God in sustaining\nits natural operations, but without performing any direct and specific\n\u201cretouching\u201d of our concepts \u201cfrom above\u201d.\nUsing our previous analogy of the acquired concept as the copy of a\npoor repro of an original, we may say that if we have a number of\ndifferent poor, fuzzy repros that are defective in a number of\ndifferent ways, then in a long and complex process of collating them,\nwe might still be able discern the underlying pattern of the original,\nand thus produce a copy that is actually closer to the original than\nany of the direct repros, without ever being allowed a glimpse of the\noriginal.\n\nIn fact, this was precisely the way Aristotelian theologians, such as\nAquinas, interpreted Augustine\u2019 conception of illumination,\nreducing God\u2019s role to providing us with the intelligible light\nnot by directly operating on any of our concepts in particular, but\nproviding the mind with \u201ca certain likeness of the uncreated\nlight, obtained through participation\u201d (ST1, q. 84, a. 5c),\nnamely, the agent intellect.\n\nMatthew of Aquasparta quite faithfully describes this view,\nassociating it with the Aristotelian position he rejects:\n\n\nSome people engaged in \u201cphilosophizing\u201d [quidam\nphilosophantes] follow this position, although not entirely, when\nthey assert that that light is the general cause of certain cognition,\nbut is not attained, and its special influence is not necessary in\nnatural cognition; but the light of the agent intellect is sufficient\ntogether with the species and similitudes of things abstracted and\nreceived from the things; for otherwise the operation of [our] nature\nwould be rendered vacuous, our intellect would understand only by\ncoincidence, and our cognition would not be natural, but supernatural.\nAnd what Augustine says, namely, that everything is seen in and\nthrough that light, is not to be understood as if the intellect would\nsomehow attain that light, nor as if that light would have some\nspecific influence on it, but in such a way that the eternal God\nnaturally endowed us with intellectual light, in which we naturally\ncognize and see all cognizable things that are within the scope of\nreason. [DHCR, p. 95]\n\n\nAlthough Matthew vehemently rejects this position as going against\nAugustine\u2019s original intention (\u201cwhich is unacceptable,\nsince he is a prominent teacher, whom catholic teachers and especially\ntheologians ought to follow\u201d \u2014 as Matthew says), this\nview, in ever more refined versions, gained more and more ground\ntoward the end of the 13th century, adopted not only by Aquinas and\nhis followers, but also by his major opponents, namely, Scotus and his\n followers.[25]\n\nStill, illuminationism and abstractionism were never treated by\nmedieval thinkers as mutually exclusive alternatives. They rather\nserved as the two poles of a balancing act in judging the respective\nroles of nature and direct divine intervention in human intellectual\n cognition.[26]\n\nAlthough Platonism definitely survived throughout the Middle Ages (and\nbeyond), in the guise of the interconnected doctrines of divine ideas,\nparticipation, and illumination, there was a quite general\nAristotelian\n consensus,[27]\n especially after Abelard\u2019s time, that the mundane universals of\nthe species and genera of material beings exist as such in the\nhuman mind, as a result of the mind\u2019s abstracting from\ntheir individuating conditions. But consensus concerning this much by\nno means entailed a unanimous agreement on exactly what the universals\nthus abstracted are, what it is for them to exist in the mind, how\nthey are related to their particulars, what their real foundation in\nthose particulars is, what their role is in the constitution of our\nuniversal knowledge, and how they contribute to the encoding and\ncommunication of this knowledge in the various human languages. For\nalthough the general Aristotelian stance towards universals\nsuccessfully handles the inconsistencies quite obviously generated by\na na\u00efve Platonist ontology, it gives rise precisely to these\nfurther problems of its own.\n6. Universals According to Abelard\u2019s Aristotelian Conception\n\nIt was Abelard who first dealt with the problem of universals\nexplicitly in this form. Having relatively easily disposed of putative\nuniversal forms as real entities corresponding to Boethius\u2019\ndefinition, in his Logica Ingredientibus he concludes that\ngiven Aristotle\u2019s definition of universals in his On\nInterpretation as those things that can be predicated of several\nthings, it is only universal words that can be regarded as\nreally existing universals. However, since according to\nAristotle\u2019s account in the same work, words are meaningful in\nvirtue of signifying concepts in the mind, Abelard soon arrives at the\nfollowing questions:\n\nWhat is the common cause in accordance with which a\ncommon name is imposed?\nWhat is the understanding\u2019s common conception of\nthe likeness of things?\nIs a word called \u201ccommon\u201d on account of the common\ncause things agree in, or on account of the common conception, or on\naccount of both together? [Five Texts, Spade 1994, p. 41\n(88)]\n\n\nThese questions open up a new chapter in the history of the problem of\nuniversals. For these questions add a new aspect to the bundle of the\noriginally primarily ontological, epistemological, and theological\nquestions constituting the problem, namely, they add a\nsemantic aspect. On the Aristotelian conception of universals\nas universal predicables, there obviously are\nuniversals, namely, our universal words. But the universality of our\nwords is clearly not dependent on the physical qualities of our\narticulate sounds, or of the various written marks indicating them,\nbut on their representative function. So, to give an account of the\nuniversality of our universal words, we have to be able to tell in\nvirtue of what they have this universal representative function, that\nis to say, we have to be able to assign a common cause by the\nrecognition of which in terms of a common concept we can give\na common name to a potential infinity of individuals\nbelonging to the same kind.\n\nBut this common cause certainly cannot be a common thing in\nthe way Boethius described universal things, for, as we have seen, the\nassumption of the existence of such a common thing leads to\ncontradictions. To be sure, Abelard also provides a number of further\narguments, dealing with several refinements of Boethius\u2019\ncharacterization of universals proposed by his contemporaries, such as\nWilliam of Champeaux, Bernard of Chartres, Clarembald of Arras,\nJocelin of Soissons, and Walter of Mortagne \u2013 but I cannot go\ninto those details\n here.[28]\n The point is that he refutes and rejects all these suggestions to\nsave real universals either as common things, having their own real\nunity, or as collections of several things, having a merely collective\nunity. The gist of his arguments against the former view is that the\nuniversal thing on that view would have to have its own numerical\nunity, and therefore, since it constitutes the substance of all its\nsingulars, all these singulars would have to be substantially one and\nthe same thing which would have to have all their contrary properties\nat the same time, which is impossible. The main thrust of his\narguments against the collection-theory is that collections are\narbitrary integral wholes of the individuals that make them up, so\nthey simply do not fill the bill of the Porphyrian characterizations\nof the essential predicables such as genera and\n species.[29]\n\nSo, the common cause of the imposition of universal words cannot be\nany one thing, or a multitude of things; yet, being a common\ncause, it cannot be nothing. Therefore, this common cause,\nwhich Abelard calls the\n status[30]\n of those things to which it is common, is a cause, but it is a cause\nwhich is a non-thing. However strange this may sound, Abelard observes\nthat sometimes we do assign causes which are not\nthings. For example, when we say \u201cThe ship was wrecked\nbecause the pilot was absent\u201d, the cause that we assign, namely,\nthat the pilot was absent is not some thing, it is rather\nhow things were, i.e., the way things were, which in\nthis case we signify by the whole proposition \u201cThe pilot was\n absent\u201d.[31]\n From the point of view of understanding what Abelard\u2019s\nstatus are, it is significant that he assimilates the causal\nrole of status as the common cause of imposition to causes\nthat are signified by whole propositions. These significata\nof whole propositions, which in English we may refer to by using the\ncorresponding \u201cthat-clauses\u201d (as I did above, referring to\nthe cause of the ship\u2019s wreck by the phrase \u201cthat the\npilot was absent\u201d), and in Latin by an\naccusative-with-infinitive construction, are what Abelard calls the\ndicta of propositions. These dicta, not being\nidentifiable with any single thing, yet, not being nothing, constitute\nan ontological realm that is completely different from that of\nordinary things. But it is also in this realm that Abelard\u2019s\ncommon causes of imposition may find their place.\n\nAbelard says that the common cause of imposition of a universal name\nhas to be something in which things falling under that name agree. For\nexample, the name \u2018man\u2019 (in the sense of \u2018human\nbeing\u2019, and not in the sense of \u2018male human being\u2019)\nis imposed on all humans on account of something in which all humans,\nas such, agree. But that in which all humans as such agree is that\neach one of them is a man, that is, each one agrees with all others in\ntheir being a man. So, it is their being human [esse\nhominem] that is the common cause Abelard was looking for, and\nthis is what he calls the status of man. The status\nof man is not a thing; it is not any singular man, for obviously no\nsingular man is common to all men, and it is not a universal man, for\nthere is no such a thing. But being a man is common in the\nrequired manner (i.e., it is something in which all humans agree), yet\nit is clearly not a thing. For let us consider the singular\npropositions \u2018Socrates is a man\u2019 [Socrates est\nhomo], \u2018Plato is a man\u2019 [Plato est homo],\netc. These signify their dicta, namely, Socrates\u2019s\nbeing a man [Socratem esse hominem], and Plato\u2019s being\na man [Platonem esse hominem], etc. But then it is clear that\nif we abstract from the singular subjects and retain what is common to\nthem all, we can get precisely the status in which all these\nsubjects agree, namely, being a man [esse hominem]. So, the\nstatus, just like the dicta from which they can be\nobtained, constitute an ontological realm that is entirely different\nfrom that of ordinary things.\n\nStill, despite the fact that it clearly has to do something with\nabstraction, an activity of the mind, Abelard insists that a\nstatus is not a concept of our mind. The reason for his\ninsistence is that the status, being the common\ncause of imposition of a common name, must be something real, the\nexistence of which is not dependent on the activity of our minds. A\nstatus is there in the nature of things, regardless of\nwhether we form a mental act whereby we recognize it or not. In fact,\nfor Abelard, a status is an object of the divine mind,\nwhereby God preconceives the state of his creation from\n eternity.[32]\n A concept, or mental image of our mind, however, exists as\nthe object of our mind only insofar as our mind performs the mental\nact whereby it forms this object. But this object, again, is not a\nthing, indeed, not any more than any other fictitious object of our\nminds. However, what distinguishes the universal concept from\na merely fictitious object of our mind is that the former\ncorresponds to a status of really existing singular things,\nwhereas the latter does not have anything corresponding to it.\n\nTo be sure, there are a number of points left in obscurity by\nAbelard\u2019s discussion concerning the relationships of the items\ndistinguished here. For example, Abelard says that we cannot conceive\nof the status. However, it seems that we can only signify by\nour words whatever we can conceive. Yet, Abelard insists that besides\nour concepts, our words must signify the status\n themselves.[33]\n A solution to the problem is only hinted at in Abelard\u2019s remark\nthat the names can signify status, because \u201ctheir\ninventor meant to impose them in accordance with certain\nnatures or characteristics of things, even if he did not know how to\nthink out the nature or characteristic of the thing\u201d (Five\nTexts, Spade 1994, p. 46 (116)). So, we may assume that although\nthe inventor of the name does not know the status, his vague,\n\u201csenses-bound\u201d conception, from which he takes\nhis word\u2019s signification, is directed at the status, as\nto that which he intends to\n signify.[34]\n However, Abelard does not work out this suggestion in any further\ndetail. Again, it is unclear how the status is related to the\nindividualized natures of the things that agree in the\nstatus. If the status is what the divine mind\nconceives of the singulars in abstraction from them, why\ncouldn\u2019t the nature itself be conceived in the same way? \u2013\nafter all, the abstract nature would not have to be a thing any more\nthan a status is, for its existence would not be\nreal being, but merely its being conceived.\nFurthermore, it seems quite plausible that Abelard\u2019s\nstatus could be derived by abstraction from singular\ndicta with the same predicate, as suggested above. But\ndicta are the quite ordinary significata of\nour propositions, which Abelard never treats as\nepistemologically problematic, so why would the status, which\nwe could apparently abstract from them, be accessible only to the\ndivine mind?\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that Abelard could not provide acceptable and\ncoherent answers to these and similar questions and\n problems.[35]\n But perhaps these problems also contributed to the fact that by the\n13th century his doctrine of status was no longer\nin currency. Another historical factor that may have contributed to\nthe waning of Abelard\u2019s theory was probably the influence of the\nnewly translated Aristotelian writings along with the Arabic\ncommentaries that flooded the Latin West in the second half of the\n12th century.\n7. Universal Natures in Singular Beings and in Singular Minds\n\nThe most important influence in this period from our point of view\ncame from Avicenna\u2019s doctrine distinguishing the absolute\nconsideration of a universal nature from what applies to the same\nnature in the subject in which it exists. The distinction is neatly\nsummarized in the following passage.\n\nHorsehood, to be sure, has a definition that does not demand\nuniversality. Rather it is that to which universality happens. Hence\nhorsehood itself is nothing but horsehood only. For in itself it is\nneither many nor one, neither is it existent in these sensibles nor in\nthe soul, neither is it any of these things potentially or actually in\nsuch a way that this is contained under the definition of horsehood.\nRather [in itself it consists] of what is horsehood\n only.[36]\n\n\nIn his little treatise On Being and Essence, Aquinas explains\nthe distinction in greater detail in the following words:\n\n\nA nature, however, or essence \u2026can be considered in two ways.\nFirst, we can consider it according to its proper notion, and this is\nits absolute consideration; and in this way nothing is true of it\nexcept what pertains to it as such; whence if anything else is\nattributed to it, that will yield a false attribution. \u2026In the\nother way [an essence] is considered as it exists in this or that\n[individual]; and in this way something is predicated of it per\naccidens [non-essentially or coincidentally], on account of that\nin which it exists, as when we say that a man is white because\nSocrates is white, although this does not pertain to man as such.\n\nA nature considered in this way, however, has two sorts of existence.\nIt exists in singulars on the one hand, and in the soul on the other,\nand from each of these [sorts of existence] it acquires accidents. In\nthe singulars, furthermore, the essence has several [acts of]\nexistence according to the multiplicity of singulars. Nevertheless, if\nwe consider the essence in the first, or absolute, sense, none of\nthese pertain to it. For it is false to say that the essence of man,\nconsidered absolutely, has existence in this singular, because if\nexistence in this singular pertained to man insofar as he is man, man\nwould never exist, except as this singular. Similarly, if it pertained\nto man insofar as he is man not to exist in this singular, then the\nessence would never exist in the singular. But it is true to say that\nman, but not insofar as he is man, may be in this singular or in that\none, or else in the soul. Therefore, the nature of man considered\nabsolutely abstracts from every existence, though it does not exclude\nany. And the nature thus considered is what is predicated of each\n individual.[37]\n\n\nSo, a common nature or essence according to its absolute consideration\nabstracts from all existence, both in the singulars and in the mind.\nYet, and this is the important point, it is the same nature\nthat informs both the singulars that have this nature and the minds\nconceiving of them in terms of this nature. To be sure, this sameness\nis not numerical sameness, and thus it does not yield numerically one\nnature. On the contrary, it is the sameness of several, numerically\ndistinct realizations of the same information-content, just like the\nsameness of a book in its several copies. Just as there is no such a\nthing as a universal book over and above the singular copies of the\nsame book, so there is no such a thing as a universal nature existing\nover and above the singular things of the same nature; still, just as\nit is true to say that the singular copies are the copies of the\nsame book, so it is true to say that these singulars are of\nthe same nature.\n\nIndeed, this analogy also shows why this conception should be so\nappealing from the point of view of the original epistemological\nproblem of the possibility of universal knowledge, without entailing\nthe ontological problems of na\u00efve Platonism. For just as we do\nnot need to read all copies of the same book in order to know what we\ncan find on the same page in the next copy (provided it is not a\ncorrupt\n copy),[38]\n so we can know what may apply to all singulars of the same nature\nwithout having to experience them all. Still, we need not assume that\nwe can have this knowledge only if we can get somehow in a mysterious\ncontact with the universal nature over and above the singulars; all we\nneed is to learn how \u201cto read\u201d the singulars in our\nexperience to discern the \u201ccommon message\u201d, the universal\nnature, informing them all, uniformly, yet in their distinct\nsingularity. (Note that \u201creading the singulars\u201d is not a\nmere metaphor: this is precisely what geneticists are quite literally\ndoing in the process of gene sequencing, for instance, in the human\ngenome project.) Therefore, the same nature is not the\nsame in the same way as the same individual having this\nnature is the same as long as it exists. For that same\nnature, insofar as it is regarded as the same, does not\neven exist at all; it is said to be the same only insofar as it is\nrecognizable as the same, if we disregard everything\nthat distinguishes its instances in several singulars. (Note here that\nwhoever would want to deny such a recognizable sameness in\nand across several singulars would have to deny that he is able to\nrecognize the same words or the same letters in various sentences; so\nsuch a person would not be able to read, write, or even to speak, or\nunderstand human speech. But then we shouldn\u2019t really worry\nabout such a person in a philosophical debate.)\n\nHowever, at this point some further questions emerge. If this common\nnature is recognizably the same on account of disregarding\nits individuating conditions in the singulars, then isn\u2019t it the\nresult of abstraction; and if so, isn\u2019t it in the abstractive\nmind as its object? But if it is, then how can Aquinas say that it\nabstracts both from being in the singulars and from\nbeing in the mind?\n\nHere we should carefully distinguish between what we can say about\nthe same nature as such, and what we can say about\nthe same nature on account of its conditions as it\nexists in this or that subject. Again, using our analogy, we can\ncertainly consistently say that the same book in its first edition was\n200 pages, whereas in the second only 100, because it was printed on\nlarger pages, but the book itself, as such, is neither 200 nor 100\npages, although it can be either. In the same way, we can consistently\nsay that the same nature as such is neither in the singulars\nnor in the mind, but of course it is only insofar as it is in the mind\nthat it can be recognizably the same, on account of the\nmind\u2019s abstraction. Therefore, that it is abstract and is\nactually recognized as the same in its many instances is something\nthat belongs to the same nature only on account of being conceived by\nthe abstractive mind. This is the reason why the nature is called a\nuniversal concept, insofar as it is in the mind. Indeed, it\nis only under this aspect that it is properly called a universal. So,\nalthough that which is predicable of several\nsingulars is nothing but the common nature as such, considered\nabsolutely, still, that it is predicable pertains to the same\nnature only on account of being conceived by the abstractive\nintellect, insofar as it is a concept of the mind.\n\nAt any rate, this is how Aquinas solves the paralogism that seems to\narise from this account, according to which the true claims that\nSocrates is a man and man is a species would seem to entail the\nfalsity that Socrates is a species. For if we say that in the\nproposition \u2018Socrates is a man\u2019 the predicate signifies\nhuman nature absolutely, but the same nature, on account of its\nabstract character, is a species, the false conclusion seems\ninevitable (Klima 1993a).\n\nHowever, since the common nature is not a species in its absolute\nconsideration, but only insofar as it is in the mind, the conclusion\ndoes not follow. Indeed, this reasoning would be just as invalid as\nthe one trying to prove that this book, pointing to the second edition\nwhich is actually 100 pages, is 200 pages, because the same book was\n200 hundred pages in its first edition. For just as its being 200\npages belongs to the same book only in its first edition, so its being\na species belongs to human nature only as it exists in the mind.\n\nSo, to sum up, we have to distinguish here between the nature existing\nin this singular (such as the individualized human nature of Socrates,\nwhich is numerically one item, mind-independently existing in\nSocrates), the universal (such as the species of human nature existing\nonly in the mind as its object considered in abstraction from the\nindividuating conditions it has in the singular humans), and the\nnature according to its absolute consideration (such as human nature\nconsidered in abstraction both from its existence in the singulars as\nits subjects and in the mind as its object). What establishes the\ndistinction of these items is the difference of what can be truly said\nof them on account of the different conditions they have in this or\nthat. What establishes the unity of these items, however, is that they\nare somehow the same nature existing and considered under different\nconditions. For the human nature in Socrates is numerically one, it is\nnumerically distinct from the human nature in Plato, and it has real,\nmind-independent existence, which is in fact nothing but the existence\nof Socrates, i.e., Socrates\u2019 life. However, although the human\nnature in Socrates is a numerically distinct item from the human\nnature in Plato, insofar as it is human nature, it is formally, in\nfact, specifically the same nature, for it is human nature, and not\nanother, specifically different, say, feline or canine nature. It is\nprecisely this formal, specific, mind-independent sameness of these\nitems (for, of course, say, this cat and that cat do not differ\ninsofar as they are feline, regardless of whether there is anyone to\nrecognize this) that allows the abstractive human mind to recognize\nthis sameness by abstracting from those individuating conditions on\naccount of which this individualized nature in this individual\nnumerically differs from that individualized nature in that\nindividual. Thus, insofar as the formally same nature is actually\nconsidered by a human mind in abstraction from these individualizing\nconditions, it is a universal, a species, an abstract object of a\nmental act whereby a human mind conceives of any individualized human\nnature without its individuating conditions. But, as we could see\nearlier, nothing can be a human nature existing without its\nindividuating conditions, although any individualized human nature can\nbe thought of without thinking of its necessarily conjoined\nindividuating conditions (just as triangular shape can be thought of\nwithout thinking its necessarily conjoined conditions of being\nisosceles or being scalene). So for this universal concept to be is\nnothing but to be thought of, to be an object of the abstractive human\nmind. Finally, human nature in its absolute consideration is the same\nnature abstracted even from this being, i.e., even from being an\nobject of the mind. Thus, as opposed to both in its existence in\nindividuals and in the mind, neither existence, nor non-existence, nor\nunity, nor disunity or multiplicity belongs to it, as it is considered\nwithout any of these; indeed, it is considered without considering its\nbeing considered, for it is considered only in terms of what belongs\nto it on account of itself, not considering anything that has to\nbelong to it on account of something else in which it can only be\n(i.e., whether in the mind or in reality). So, the nature according to\nits absolute consideration does not have numerical unity or\nmultiplicity, which it has as it exists in individuals, nor does it\nhave the formal unity that it has in the consideration of the mind\n(insofar as it is one species among many), but it has that formal\nunity which precedes even the recognition of this unity by the\nabstractive\n mind.[39]\n\nNevertheless, even if with these distinctions Aquinas\u2019 solution\nof the paralogism works and what he says about the existence and unity\nvs. multiplicity of a common nature can be given a consistent\ninterpretation, the emergence of the paralogism itself and the\ncomplexities involved in explaining it away, as well as the problems\ninvolved in providing this consistent interpretation show the inherent\ndifficulties of this account. The main difficulty is the trouble of\nkeeping track of what we are talking about when it becomes crucial to\nknow what pertains to what on account of what; in general, when the\nconditions of identity and distinction of the items we are talking\nabout become variable and occasionally rather unclear.\n\nIndeed, we can appreciate just how acute these difficulties may become\nif we survey the items that needed to be distinguished in what may be\ndescribed as the common conceptual framework of the\n\u201crealist\u201d via antiqua, the \u201cold way\u201d\nof doing philosophy and theology, before the emergence of the\n\u201cmodern way\u201d, the \u201cnominalist\u201d via\nmoderna challenging some fundamental principles of the older\nframework, resulting mostly from the semantic innovations introduced\nby William Ockham. The survey of these items and the problems they\ngenerate will then allow us to see in greater detail the main\nmotivation for Ockham\u2019s innovations.\n8. Universals in the Via Antiqua\n\nIn this framework, we have first of all the universal or common terms\nof spoken and written languages, which are common on account of being\nimposed upon universal concepts of the human mind. The concepts\nthemselves are universal on account of being obtained by the activity\nof the abstractive human mind from experiences of singulars. But the\nprocess of concept formation also involves various stages.\n\nIn the first place, the sensory information collected by the single\nsenses is distinguished, synthesized, and collated by the higher\nsensory faculties of the common sense [sensus communis] and\nthe so-called cogitative power [vis cogitativa], to be stored\nin sensory memory as phantasms, the sensory representations\nof singulars in their singularity. The active intellect\n[intellectus agens] uses this sensory information to extract\nits intelligible content and produce the intelligible species\n[species intelligibiles], the universal representations of\nseveral individuals in their various degrees of formal unity,\ndisregarding their distinctive features and individuating conditions\nin the process of abstraction.\n\nThe intelligible species are stored in the intellectual memory of the\npotential intellect [intellectus possibilis], which can then\nuse them to form the corresponding concept in an act of thought, for\nexample, in forming a judgment. The intelligible species and the\nconcepts themselves, being formed by individual human minds, are\nindividual in their being, insofar as they pertain to this or that\nhuman mind. However, since they are the result of abstraction, in\ntheir information content they are universal.\n\nNow insofar as this universal information content is common to all\nminds that form these concepts at all, and therefore it is a common\nintelligible content gained by these minds from their objects insofar\nas they are conceived by these minds in a universal manner, later\nscholastic thinkers refer to it as the objective concept\n[conceptus obiectivus], distinguishing it from the formal or\nsubjective concepts [conceptus formales seu subiectivi],\nwhich are the individual acts of individual minds carrying this\ninformation (just as the individual copies of a book carry the\ninformation content of the\n book).[40]\n It is this objective concept that is identified as the universal of\nthe human mind (distinguished from the universals of the divine mind),\nnamely, a species, a genus, a difference, a property, or an accident.\n(Note that these are only the simple concepts. Complex concepts, such\nas those corresponding to complex terms and propositions are the\nproducts of the potential intellect using these concepts in its\nfurther operations.)\n\nThese universals, then, as the objective concepts of the mind, would\nbe classified as beings of reason [entia rationis], the being\nof which consists in their being conceived (cf. Klima 1993b and\nSchmidt 1966). To be sure, they are not merely fictitious objects, for\nthey are grounded in the nature of things insofar as they carry the\nuniversal information content abstracted from the singulars. But then\nagain, the universal information content of the objective concept\nitself, considered not insofar as it is in the mind as its object, but\nin itself, disregarding whatever may carry it, is distinguished from\nits carriers both in the mind and in the ultimate objects of the mind,\nthe singular things, as the nature of these things in its absolute\nconsideration.\n\nHowever, the common nature as such cannot exist on its own any more\nthan a book could exist without any copies of it or any minds\nconceiving of it. So, this common nature has real existence only in\nthe singulars, informing them, and giving them their recognizably\ncommon characteristics. However, these common characteristics can be\nrecognized as such only by a mind capable of abstracting the common\nnature from experiencing it in its really existing singular instances.\nBut it is on account of the real existence of these individualized\ninstances in the singulars that the common nature can truly be\npredicated of the singulars, as long as they are actually informed by\nthese individualized instances.\n\nThe items thus distinguished and their interconnections can be\nrepresented by the following block-diagram. The dashed frames indicate\nthat the items enclosed by them have a certain reduced ontological\nstatus, a \u201cdiminished\u201d mode of being, while the boxes\npartly sharing a side indicate the (possible) partial identities of\nthe items they\n enclose.[41]\n The arrows pointing from the common term to the singulars, their\nindividualized natures and items in the mind on this diagram represent\nsemantic relations, which I am going to explain later, in connection\nwith Ockham\u2019s innovations. The rest of the arrows indicate the\nflow of information from experience of singulars through the sensory\nfaculties to the abstractive mind, and to the application of the\nuniversal information abstracted by the mind to further singular\nexperiences in acts of judgment.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. The via antiqua\nconception\n\n\nObviously, this is a rather complicated picture. However, its\ncomplexity itself should not be regarded as problematic or even\nsurprising, for that matter. After all, this diagram merely\nsummarizes, and distinguishes the main stages of, how the human mind\nprocesses the intelligible, universal information received from a\nmultitude of singular experiences, and then again, how it applies this\ninformation in classifying further experiences. This process may\nreasonably be expected to be complex, and should not be expected to\ninvolve fewer stages than, e.g., setting up, and retrieving\ninformation from, a computer database.\n\nWhat renders this picture more problematic is rather the difficulties\ninvolved in identifying and distinguishing these stages and the\ncorresponding items. Further complications were also generated by the\nvariations in terminology among several authors, and the various\ncriteria of identity and distinctness applied by them in introducing\nvarious different notions of identity and distinctness. In fact, many\nof the great debates of the authors working within this framework can\nbe characterized precisely as disputing the identity or distinctness\nof the items featured here, or the very criteria of identifying or\ndistinguishing them.\n\nFor example, already Abelard raised the question whether the concept\nor mental image, which we may identify in the diagram as the objective\nconcept of later authors, should be identified with the act of\nthought, which we may identify as the subjective concept, or perhaps a\nfurther act of the mind, called formatio, namely, the\npotential intellect\u2019s act of forming the concept, using the\nintelligible species as the principle of its action. Such distinctions\nwere later on severely criticized by authors such as John Peter Olivi\nand others, who argued for the elimination of intelligible species,\nand, in general, of any intermediaries between an act of the intellect\nand its ultimate objects, the singulars conceived in a universal\n manner.[42]\n\nAgain, looking at the diagram on the side of the singulars, most\n13th century authors agreed that what accounts for the\nspecific unity of several individuals of the same species, namely,\ntheir specific nature, should be something other than what accounts\nfor their numerical distinctness, namely, their principle of\nindividuation. However, one singular entity in a species of several\nco-specific individuals has to contain both the principle of the\nspecific unity of these individuals and its own principle of\nindividuation. Therefore, this singular entity, being a composite at\nleast of its specific nature and its principle of individuation, has\nto be distinct from its specific nature. At any rate, this is the\nsituation with material substances, whose principle of individuation\nwas held to be their matter. However, based on this reasoning,\nimmaterial substances, such as angels, could not be regarded as\nnumerically distinct on account of their matter, but only on account\nof their form. But since form is the principle of specific unity,\ndifference in form causes specific diversity. Therefore, on this\nbasis, any two angels had to be regarded as different in species. This\nconclusion was explicitly drawn by Aquinas and others, but it was\nrejected by Augustinian theologians, and it was condemned in Paris in\n 1277.[43]\n\nSo, no wonder authors such as Henry of Ghent and Duns Scotus worked\nout alternative accounts of individuation, introducing not only\ndifferent principles of individuation, such as the Scotists\u2019\nfamous (or infamous) haecceity, but also different criteria\nof distinctness and identity, such as those grounding Henry of\nGhent\u2019s intentional distinction, or Scotus\u2019s\nformal\n distinction,[44]\n or even later Suarez\u2019 modal\n distinction.[45]\n\nBut even further problems arose from considering the identity or\ndistinctness of the individualized natures signified by several common\nterms in one and the same individual. The metaphysical debate over the\nreal distinction of essence and existence from this point of view is\nnothing but the issue whether the individualized common nature\nsignified by the definition of a thing is the same as the act of being\nsignified by the verb \u2018is\u2019 in the same thing. In fact, the\nfamous problem of the plurality vs. unity of substantial forms may\nalso be regarded as a dispute over whether the common natures\nsignified by the substantial predicates on the Porphyrian tree in the\ncategory of substance are distinct or the same in the same individual\n(cf. Callus 1967). Finally, and this appears to be the primary\nmotivation for Ockham\u2019s innovations, there was the question\nwhether one must regard all individualized common natures signified in\nthe same individual by several predicates in the ten Aristotelian\ncategories as distinct from one another. For the affirmative answer\nwould involve commitment to a virtually limitless multiplication of\nentities.\n\nIndeed, according to Ockham, the via antiqua conception would\nentail that\n\na column is to the right by to-the-rightness, God is creating by\ncreation, is good by goodness, just by justice, mighty by might, an\naccident inheres by inherence, a subject is subjected by subjection,\nthe apt is apt by aptitude, a chimera is nothing by nothingness,\nsomeone blind is blind by blindness, a body is mobile by mobility, and\nso on for other, innumerable\n cases.[46]\n\n\nAnd this is nothing, but \u201cmultiplying beings according to the\nmultiplicity of terms\u2026 which, however, is erroneous and leads\nfar away from the\n truth\u201d.[47]\n9. Universals in the Via Moderna\n\nTo be sure, as the very debates within the via antiqua\nframework concerning the identity or non-identity of various items\ndistinguished in that framework indicate, Ockham\u2019s charges are\nnot quite\n justified.[48]\n After all, several via antiqua authors did allow\nthe identification of the significata of terms belonging to\nvarious categories, so their \u201cmultiplication of beings\u201d\ndid not necessarily match the multiplicity of terms. Furthermore,\nsince via antiqua authors also distinguished between various\nmodes or senses of being, allowing various sorts of\n\u201cdiminished\u201d kinds of being, such as beings of\nreason, their ontological commitments were certainly not as\nunambiguous as Ockham would have us believe in this passage. However,\nif we contrast the diagram of the via antiqua framework above\nwith the following schematic representation of the via\nmoderna framework introduced by Ockham, we can immediately\nappreciate the point of Ockham\u2019s innovations.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. The via moderna\nconception\n\n\nWithout a doubt, it is the captivating simplicity of this picture,\nespecially as compared with the complexity of the via antiqua\npicture, that was the major appeal of the Ockhamist approach. There\nare fewer items here, equally on the same ontological footing,\ndistinguished from one another in terms of the same unambiguous\ndistinction, the numerical distinction between individual real\nentities.\n\nTo be sure, there still are universals in this picture. But these\nuniversals are neither common natures \u201ccontracted\u201d to\nindividuals by some really or merely formally distinct principle of\nindividuation, nor some universal objects of the mind, which exist in\na \u201cdiminished\u201d manner, as beings of reason.\nOckham\u2019s universals, at least in his mature\n theory,[49]\n are just our common terms and our common concepts. Our common terms,\nwhich are just singular utterances or inscriptions, are common in\nvirtue of being subordinated to our common concepts. Our common\nconcepts, on the other hand, are just singular acts of our singular\nminds. Their universality consists simply in the universality of their\nrepresentative function. For example, the common term\n\u2018man\u2019 is a spoken or written universal term of English,\nbecause it is subordinated to that concept of our minds by which we\nconceive of each man indifferently. (See Klima, 2011) It is this\nindifference in its representative function that enables the singular\nact of my mind to conceive of each man in a universal manner, and the\nsame goes for the singular act of your mind. Accordingly, there is no\nneed to assume that there is anything in the individual humans,\ndistinct from these humans themselves, a common yet individualized\nnature waiting to be abstracted by the mind. All we need to assume is\nthat two humans are more similar to each other than either of them to\na brute animal, and all animals are more similar to each other than\nany of them to a plant, etc., and that the mind, being able to\nrecognize this similarity, is able to represent the humans by means of\na common specific concept, the animals by means of a common generic\nconcept, all living things by means of a more general generic concept,\n etc.[50]\n In this way, then, the common terms subordinated to these concepts\nneed not signify some abstract common nature in the mind, and\nconsequently its individualized instances in the singulars, for they\ndirectly signify the singulars themselves, just as they are directly\nconceived by the universally representative acts of the mind. So, what\nthese common terms signify are just the singulars themselves, which\nare also the things referred to by these terms when they are used in\npropositions. Using the customary rendering of the medieval logical\nterminology, the things ultimately signified by a common term are its\nsignificata, while the things referred to by the same term\nwhen it is used in a proposition are their (personal)\n supposita.[51]\n\nNow if we compare the two diagrams representing the respective\nconceptions of the two viae, we can see just how radically\nOckham\u2019s innovations changed the character of the semantic\nrelations connecting terms, concepts and things. In both\nviae, common terms are subordinated to common concepts, and\nit is in virtue of this subordination that they ultimately signify\nwhat their concepts represent. In the via moderna, a concept\nis just an act of the mind representing singulars in a more or less\nindifferent manner, yielding a more or less universal signification\nfor the term. In the via antiqua, however, the act of the\nmind is just one item in a whole series of intermediary\nrepresentations, distinguished in terms of their different functions\nin processing universal information, and connected by their common\ncontent, ultimately representing the common, yet individualized\nnatures of their\n singulars.[52]\n Accordingly, a common term, expressing this common content, is\nprimarily subordinated to the objective concept of the mind. But of\ncourse, this objective concept is only the common content of the\nsingular representative acts of singular minds, their subjective\nconcepts, formed by means of the intelligible species, abstracted by\ntheir active intellects. On the other hand, the objective concept,\nabstracting from all individuating conditions, expresses only what is\ncommon to all singulars, namely, their nature considered absolutely.\nBut this absolutely considered nature is only the common content of\nwhat informs each singular of the same nature in its actual real\nexistence. So, the term\u2019s ultimate significata will\nhave to be the individualized natures of the singulars. But these\nultimate significata may still not be the singulars\nthemselves, namely, when the things informed by these\nsignificata are not metaphysically simple. In the via\nmoderna conception, therefore, the ultimate significata\nof a term are nothing but those singular things that can be the\nterm\u2019s supposita in various propositions, as a matter\nof semantics. By contrast, in the via antiqua conception, a\nterm\u2019s ultimate significata may or may not be the same\nthings as the term\u2019s (personal) supposita, depending on\nthe constitution of these supposita, as a matter of\nmetaphysics. The singulars will be the supposita of the term\nwhen it is used as the subject term of a proposition in which\nsomething is predicated about the things informed by these ultimate\nsignificata (in the case of metaphysically simple entities,\nthe term\u2019s significata and supposita\n coincide).[53]\n\nNevertheless, despite the nominalists\u2019 charges to the contrary,\nthe via antiqua framework, as far as its semantic\nconsiderations are concerned, was no more committed to the real\ndistinction of the significata and supposita of its\ncommon terms than the via moderna framework was. For if the\nsemantic theory in itself had precluded the identification of these\nsemantic values, then the question of possible identity of these\nvalues could not have been meaningfully raised in the first place.\nFurthermore, in that case such identifications would have been\nprecluded as meaningless even when talking about metaphysically simple\nentities, such as angels and God, whereas the metaphysical simplicity\nof these entities was expressed precisely in terms of such\nidentifications. But also in the mundane cases of the\nsignificata and supposita of concrete and abstract\nuniversal terms in the nine accidental categories, several via\nantiqua authors argued for the identification of these semantic\nvalues both within and across categories. First of all there was\nAristotle\u2019s authority for the claim that action and passion are\nthe same\n motion,[54]\n so the significata of terms in these two categories could not be\nregarded as really distinct entities. But several authors also argued\nfor the identification of relations with their foundations, that is to\nsay, for the identity of the significata of relative terms with the\nsignificata of terms in the categories quantity and quality. (For\nexample, on this conception, my equality in height to you would be\njust my height, provided you were of the same height, and not a\ndistinct \u201cequality-thing\u201d somehow attached to my height,\ncaused by our equal\n heights.)[55]\n\nBy contrast, what makes the via moderna approach simpler is\nthat it \u201cautomatically\u201d achieves such identifications\nalready on the basis of its semantic principles. Since in this\napproach the significata of concrete common terms are just\nthe singulars directly represented by the corresponding concepts, the\nsignificata and (personal) supposita of terms are\ntaken to be the same singulars from the beginning. So these common\nterms signify and supposit for the same things\neither absolutely, provided the term is absolute, or in\nrelation to other singulars, provided the term is\nconnotative. But even in the case of connotative terms, such\nas relative terms (in fact, all terms in the nine accidental\ncategories, except for some abstract terms in the category quality,\naccording to Ockham) we do not need to assume the existence of some\nmysterious relational entities informing singular substances. For\nexample, the term \u2018father\u2019 need not be construed as\nsignifying in me an inherent relation, my fatherhood, somehow\nconnecting me to my son, and suppositing for me on that account in the\ncontext of a proposition; rather, it should merely be construed as\nsignifying me in relation to my son, thereby suppositing for me in the\ncontext of a proposition, while connoting my son.\n10. The Separation of the Viae, and the Breakdown of Scholastic Discourse in Late-Medieval Philosophy\n\nThe appeal of the simplicity of the via moderna approach,\nespecially as it was systematically articulated in the works of John\nBuridan and his students, had a tremendous impact on late-medieval\nphilosophy and theology. To be sure, many late-medieval scholars, who\nwere familiar with both ways, would have shared the sentiment\nexpressed by the remark of Domingo Soto (1494\u20131560, describing\nhimself as someone who was \u201cborn among nominalists and raised by\n realists\u201d)[56]\n to the effect that whereas the realist doctrine of the via\nantiqua was more difficult to understand, still, the nominalist\ndoctrine of the via moderna was more difficult to\n believe.[57]\n Nevertheless, the overall simplicity and internal consistency of the\nnominalist approach were undeniable, gathering a strong following by\nthe 15th century in all major universities of Europe, old\nand newly established\n alike.[58]\n\nThe resulting separation and the ensuing struggle of the medieval\nviae did not end with the victory of the one over the other.\nInstead, due to the primarily semantic nature of the\nseparation, getting the parties embroiled in increasingly complicated\nways of talking past each other, thereby generating an ever growing\ndissatisfaction, even contempt, in a new, lay, humanist\n intelligentsia,[59]\n it ended with the demise of the characteristically medieval\nconceptual frameworks of both viae in the late-medieval and\nearly modern period.\n\nThese developments, therefore, also put an end to the specifically\nmedieval problem of universals. However, the increasingly\nrarified late-medieval problem eventually vanished only to give way to\nseveral modern variants of recognizably the same\nproblem, which keeps recurring in one form or another in contemporary\nphilosophy as well. Indeed, one may safely assert that as long as\nthere is interest in the questions of how a human language obviously\nabounding in universal terms can be meaningfully mapped onto a world\nof singulars, there is a problem of universals, regardless of\nthe details of the particular conceptual framework in which the\nrelevant questions are articulated. Clearly, in this sense, the\nproblem of universals is itself a universal, the universal problem of\naccounting for the relationships between mind, language, and\nreality.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Aquinas, <em>Opera Omnia</em>, R.
