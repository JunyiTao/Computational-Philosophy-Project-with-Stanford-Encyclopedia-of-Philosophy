    "main_text": "Neurobiological Theories of Consciousness || Frontal or Posterior?\n3.5 Frontal or Posterior?\n\nIn recent years, one way to frame the debate between theories of\ngeneric consciousness is whether the \u201cfront\u201d or the\n\u201cback\u201d of the brain is crucial. Using this rough\ndistinction allows us to draw the following contrasts: Recurrent\nprocessing theories focus on sensory areas (in vision, the\n\u201cback\u201d of the brain) such that where processing achieves a\ncertain recurrent state, the relevant contents are conscious even if\nno higher-order thought is formed or no content enters the global\nworkspace. Similarly, proponents of IIT have recently emphasized a\n\u201cposterior hot zone\u201d covering parietal and occipital areas\n(Boly et al. 2017) as a neural correlate for consciousness, as they\nspeculate that this zone may have the highest value for \u03a6. For\ncertain higher-order thought theories, having a higher-order state,\nsupported by prefrontal cortex, without corresponding sensory states\ncan suffice for conscious states. In this case, the front of the brain\nwould be sufficient for consciousness. Finally, the global neuronal\nworkspace, drawing on workspace neurons that are present across brain\nareas to form the workspace, might be taken to straddle the\ndifference, depending on the type of conscious state involved. They\nrequire entry into the global workspace such that neither sensory\nactivity nor a higher order thought on its own is sufficient, i.e.,\nneither just the front nor the back of the brain.\n\nThe point of talking coarsely of brain anatomy in this way is to\nhighlight the neural focus of each theory and thus, of targets of\nmanipulation as we aim for explanatory neural correlates in terms of\nwhat is necessary and/or sufficient for generic consciousness. What is\nclear is that once theories make concrete predictions of brain areas\ninvolved in generic consciousness, neuroscience can test them.\n",
