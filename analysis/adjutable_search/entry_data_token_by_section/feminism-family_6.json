    "main_text": "How should family structures be evaluated? || Equality based evaluations\n2.2 Equality based evaluations\n\n Many egalitarian arguments agree with much of the choice\nbased perspective and hold that choice, liberty and privacy are all\nimportant elements of just families and reproductive practices. But\nfeminists making these arguments question whether a contractual,\nchoice based approach to these issues adequately captures other values\nthat are also important. The fact that an arrangement has been chosen\ndoes not make it just. In addition to choice, egalitarian feminists\nstress gender equality and the protection of the vulnerable.\n\n\nConsider the domestic division of labor. Drawing on the above\ndiscussion of labor market segregation, some feminists argue that the\ngendered division of labor in the family, even if freely chosen,\noperates in the context of a background system of injustice. The fact\nthat it is freely chosen then (if it is) does not seek to justify it.\nChoices are not all that is relevant to moral evaluation for two\nreasons. First, because we need to maintain just background social\nstructures, we must be attentive to choices that would undermine these\nstructures. If gendered families encourage the subordination and\ndeference of girls, and produce unequal opportunities for boys and\ngirls, then a just society must seek to redress those effects. Second,\nthe understanding of marriage as a choice does not by itself draw\nattention to the background social institutions \u2014 institutions which\nfeminists argue are unjust. It is not enough to allow people to choose\nif their choices are unfairly constrained by unequal family and\nworkplace structures, unequal pay for equal work, and inadequate social and welfare services which\ntogether render so many women vulnerable. Over a century ago, Mill had\npointed out that women's decision to marry could scarcely be called\n\u201cfree\u201d given women's low wages, and dim employment and\neducational prospects. The choice to marry was he said, a Hobson's\nchoice, that or nothing. Although the situation of women has improved,\nmarriage remains an economic necessity for many women today as well. We\nmust attend to the wider context in which choices are made.\n\n\nEgalitarians supplement and constrain the contract-based perspective\nwhere it renders woman subordinate or especially vulnerable. They might\nalso point out, with the critics of choice based views, that some\nchoices are not and cannot be fully informed. Consider, for example, a\ncontract based view of marriage and child-bearing that holds people\nfully responsible for the results of their choices. Contracts in\nmarriage and childbearing involve potentially long-term contracts, with\nimplications that are not easily known in advance. Can a woman who has\nnever been pregnant accurately predict the effects of ceding her\nparental rights to a child? Can an eighteen year old woman who agrees\nto a traditional gendered division of labor in her marriage know what\nshe will feel like as a fifty year old woman suddenly left by her\nhusband?\n\n\nFeminists differ on whether choices within the family that undermine\ngender equality should be respected. They also differ on how to deal\nwith those choices when it is agreed that they must be redressed. Some\nfeminists prefer to de-rail such choices indirectly, by\ncreating incentives for people to act so as to maintain just social\nstructures or by creating external counterweights to individual\nactions. Okin (1989) argues, for example, that spouses should be\nequally entitled to each other's earnings, that day care should be available to all\nfamilies, and that work should be made more flexible. She believes\nthat reconfiguring outward structures is the most appropriate way to\nshape individual choice inside the family. Alternative views give less\nroom for individual choice within the family. Consider proposals to\nlegally mandate shared domestic responsibilities. Other feminists\nconsider such a remedy worse than the malady it is designed to redress\n(Elshtain 1990).\n\n\nSome feminist scholars explicitly try to combine and balance a\ncommitment to choice with a commitment to equality. Molly Shanley\n(2003) advocates an \u201cequal status\u201d view of marriage that\ncombines a commitment to the public importance of marriage as an\ninstitution with elements of individual choice that broaden the idea\nof who can marry to groups that have been denied such status as a\nresult of their subordination and stigmatization. Shanley emphasizes\nthe public's interest in sustaining just marriages, as well\nas its interest in sustaining certain forms of family relationship in\nthe face of poverty or illness. Equal status requires attention to the\nbackground in which individual choices are made, especially to issues\nof poverty, workplace structure and job market segregation. But it\nalso attends to the value of intimacy and the role of choices as\nenabling or undermining that intimacy.\n\n\nChoice based arguments and equality arguments differ on the\nnature of the marriages they would allow. For example, while a choice\nbased contractual view favors plural marriages, egalitarian arguments\ndo not straightforwardly imply a right to legalized polygamy. For\negalitarians, the crucial question would be whether polygamy is\npossible without the subordination of women.\n\n\nThere is thus serious disagreement among feminists (and non\nfeminists!) as to how to balance freedom and equality, and more\nspecifically values based on freedom of association and freedom of\nreligion with the value of gender equality. This disagreement has\nimplications for the scope of legitimate state intervention in family\nlife. (For further discussion, see Nussbaum 2000.)\n",
