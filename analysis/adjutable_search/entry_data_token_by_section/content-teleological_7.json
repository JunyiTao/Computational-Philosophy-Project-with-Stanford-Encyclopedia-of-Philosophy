    "main_text": "Teleosemantic Theories || Other Views\n3.5 Other Views\n\nRecent years have seen a considerable revival of the naturalistic\nprogram in general, and teleosemantics in particular. In addition to\nnew work by Millikan, Neander and Papineau, there have been a number\nof significant contributions by other authors as well. Some of these\nare presented in this section; others, which are more closely\nconcerned with particular problems for the teleosemantic approach,\nwill be discussed in \n section 4. \n\nAmong the new approaches, one of the most influential is Nicholas\nShea\u2019s \u201cvaritel semantics\u201d, which is carefully\nworked out in his (2018). Although this theory stands firmly in the\ntradition of Millikan and Papineau, it has a number of novel and\ndistinctive features. According to Shea, representational systems are\ncharacterized by three features, which are usually found together in\nnature, and which have to do with the production of\n\u2018outcomes\u2019 (i.e. movements, actions, or the consequences\nof actions). More specifically, the outcomes produced by\nrepresentational systems are (i) \u201crobust\u201d, (ii)\n\u201cstabilized\u201d, and (iii) they are being brought about by\nmechanisms \u201cin which internal components stand in exploitable\nrelations to relevant features of the environment\u201d (Shea 2018,\n51). Let us look at these three characteristics in turn.\n\nFirst, the production of an outcome F is supposed to be\nrobust. In Shea\u2019s terminology, this means that F is\nproduced (a) \u201cin response to a range of different inputs\u201d\nand (b) \u201cin a range of different relevant external\nconditions\u201d (Shea 2018, 55). Depending on the ranges in\nquestion, the production of F can be described as more or less robust.\nOf particular importance is clause (a) of the definition, since it is\ndemanding enough to exclude certain outcomes completely. If, for\nexample, a plant closes its flowers only in response to a change in\ntemperature, then the flower-closing behavior does not qualify as a\nrobust outcome. However, if the plant also closes its flowers in\nresponse to some other input, e.g. a change in light levels, then the\nbehavior does count as (minimally) robust (Shea 2018, 213\u2013214).\n\nSecondly, the production of outcome F by system S is supposed to have\nbeen stabilized by a process of natural selection, a process of\nindividual learning, or by having contributed to the survival of S. In\nother words, F must be an etiological function of S, although it\nshould be noted that Shea expands the processes that can ground such\nfunctions by including past contributions to survival in addition to\nnatural selection and learning. (Furthermore, Shea allows that\nrepresentational systems may have design functions instead of\nstabilized functions, so stabilization is not strictly necessary for\nrepresentation; cf. Shea 2018, 64\u201365.)\n\nThirdly, the production of outcome F by system S must involve a\nmechanism with internal components (vehicles) that stand in\nexploitable relations to environmental features. In many cases, the\nexploitable relations in question are informational: the\nmechanism\u2019s internal components carry correlational information\nabout the presence of certain features in the environment (Shea 2018,\n ch. 4).[16] \n In other cases, the exploitable relations are relations\nof structural correspondence: the mechanism\u2019s internal\ncomponents stand in relations to each other that \u2018mirror\u2019\nrelations between entities in the external world (Shea 2018,\nch. 5). Furthermore, there may still be other types of exploitable\nrelations. This pluralism about the relations that are constitutive of\nrepresentational content is one of the reasons why Shea names his\napproach \u201cvaritel semantics\u201d (Shea 2018, 43). \n\nOne respect in which Shea\u2019s approach is very attractive is the\nfact that he pays close attention to the explanatory role of\nrepresentations, and offers a detailed argument for the claim that his\ntheory can account for the \u201cexplanatory purchase\u201d of\nrepresentational properties (Shea 2018, ch. 8). Another potential\nadvantage is the fact that Shea does not rely on the producer-consumer\nmodel that has long dominated in the teleosemantics literature, and\ninstead adopts a more flexible framework that allows for highly\ninterconnected representational systems that cannot be cleanly\nseparated into subsystems (Shea 2018, 19).\n\nHowever, there also several respects in which the theory may appear\nproblematic. Some critics object that Shea\u2019s way of drawing the\ndistinction between representational and non-representational systems\nis unconvincing, either because his requirements for representational\nstatus are too weak (Rescorla 2021, Kracauer 2022), or because the\ndistinction is not significant from an explanatory point of view\n(Ganson 2021b, 287). Other theorists have criticized Shea\u2019s\nclaims about the explananda (Rupert 2022) and the utility (Egan 2020)\nof representational explanations. (For replies to some of these\nobjections, cf. Shea 2020 and 2022.) Finally, given that Shea\u2019s\naccount of content determination resembles those of Millikan and\nPapineau, one may wonder whether some of their problems (especially\nthe problem of overly specific contents) are also problems for\nShea.\n\nThere is another family of views that has gained some prominence in\nrecent years, and that should be discussed in this section. What\ndistinguishes these views from standard teleosemantic theories is the\nfact that they combine a teleological theory of content with a\nnon-etiological account of function (Schroeder 2004; Nanay 2014; Bauer\n2017; Piccinini \n 2020a).[17]\n\n\nNanay\u2019s (2014) proposal, for instance, combines a broadly\nDretskean version of informational teleosemantics with Nanay\u2019s\nown modal theory of functions (Nanay 2010). Like Dretske, Nanay\nmaintains that representing something consists in \u201chaving the\nfunction to indicate (carry information about)\u201d it (Nanay 2014,\n799). However, it should be noted that he restricts this account to\n\u201cpragmatic representations\u201d, which are defined as the\nrepresentations that are most directly involved in the guidance of\nactions (Nanay 2014, 805). His account of content can thus be\nsummarized as follows: for any pragmatic representation R, R\nrepresents that p iff R has the function of indicating (carrying the\ninformation) that p. This account of content is then combined with\nNanay\u2019s modal theory of functions which says, roughly speaking,\nthat a (token) trait of an organism has the function to do X if doing\nX would contribute to the organism\u2019s fitness. Accordingly, a\nrough formulation of Nanay\u2019s theory says that a pragmatic\nrepresentation R of an organism O represents that p iff R\u2019s\nindicating (carrying the information) that p would contribute to\nO\u2019s fitness (Nanay 2014, 804). \n\nThe main advantage of Nanay\u2019s proposal is that it is a\nthoroughly non-historical account of content. As such, it avoids the\ndifficulties of standard teleosemantic accounts that arise from the\nassumption that content properties are determined by selectional\nhistory, like the Swampman problem \n (section 4.2), or problems\nconcerning our epistemic access to content properties. On the other\nhand, the modal theory of function that serves as the basis for\nNanay\u2019s account has been heavily criticized (Artiga 2014, Garson\n2019c), and there are also some more specific objections to his\ntreatment of representational content (cf. Bauer 2017; Hundertmark\n2018, 156\u2013170).\n\nA different non-etiological version of teleosemantics has recently\nbeen developed by Piccinini (2020a, 2020b). Piccinini (2020a) also\nstarts with a version of informational teleosemantics, restricted to\nsensory representations. Simplifying a bit, his account says that a\nsensory representation R has the content <p> if (i) R\u2019s\nproducer has the function of generating R so that R carries the\ninformation that p, and (ii) R can guide the agent\u2019s behavior\nwith respect to the fact that p (Piccinini 2020a, 263). (This account\nis extended to other types of representation in Piccinini 2020b.) In a\nfurther step, Piccinini combines his teleological analysis of content\nwith a so-called goal-contribution theory of function (Piccinini\n2020a, ch. 3; Maley & Piccinini 2017). This theory construes\nbiological functions as regular contributions to the (objective)\nbiological goals of an organism, where these goals include survival,\ndevelopment, reproduction and helping others (especially offspring and\nrelatives). \n\nThis theory of function is not completely ahistorical, since the\npopulation relevant for determining whether a trait makes a\nregular contribution to fitness may extend into the past\n(Maley & Piccinini 2017, 245, fn 10), but it does make functions\nmuch less dependent on historical facts than they are on etiological\naccounts. This fact may be used to argue that Piccinini\u2019s\naccount has advantages over standard teleosemantic theories when it\ncomes to problems concerning our epistemic access to contents. But\nwhether this is the case, and whether the theory can avoid the\ndifficulties that plague other non-etiological versions of\nteleosemantics, is a topic for future discussions.\n",
