At least since the Crusades and\nthe conquest of the Americas, political theorists have used theories\nof justice, contract, and natural law to both criticize and justify\nEuropean domination. In the nineteenth century, the contradiction\nbetween liberal ideals and colonial practice became particularly\nacute, as the dominion of Europe over the rest of the world reached\nits zenith. This entry begins with a definition of colonialism, and\nthe second section explains how European thinkers justified,\nlegitimized, and challenged the conquest of the Americas. The third\nsection focuses on liberalism and the fourth section briefly discusses\nthe Marxist tradition, including Marx\u2019s own defense of British\ncolonialism in India and Lenin\u2019s anti-imperialist writings. The\nfifth section provides an introduction to contemporary\n\u201cpost-colonial theory.\u201d This approach has been\nparticularly influential in literary studies because it draws\nattention to the diverse ways that postcolonial subjectivities are\nconstituted and resisted through discursive practices. The final\nsection will introduce Indigenous critiques of settler-colonialism\nthat emerge as a response to colonial practices of domination and\ndispossession of land, customs and traditional history and to\npost-colonial theories of universalism.

Definition and Outline\n\nColonialism is not a modern phenomenon. World history is full of\nexamples of one society gradually expanding by incorporating adjacent\nterritory and settling its people on newly conquered territory. In the\nsixteenth century, colonialism changed decisively because of\ntechnological developments in navigation that began to connect more\nremote parts of the world. The modern European colonial project\nemerged when it became possible to move large numbers of people across\nthe ocean and to maintain political control in spite of geographical\ndispersion. This entry uses the term colonialism to describe the\nprocess of European settlement, violent dispossession and political\ndomination over the rest of the world, including the Americas,\nAustralia, and parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nThe difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the\nterm is often used as a synonym for imperialism. Both colonialism and\nimperialism were forms of conquest that were expected to benefit\nEurope economically and strategically. The term colonialism is\nfrequently used to describe the settlement of North America,\nAustralia, New Zealand, Algeria, and Brazil, places that were\ncontrolled by a large population of permanent European residents. The\nterm imperialism often describes cases in which a foreign government\nadministers a territory without significant settlement; typical\nexamples include the scramble for Africa in the late nineteenth\ncentury and the American domination of the Philippines and Puerto\nRico. The distinction between the two, however, is not entirely\nconsistent in the literature. Some scholars distinguish between\ncolonies for settlement and colonies for economic exploitation. Others\nuse the term colonialism to describe dependencies that are directly\ngoverned by a foreign nation and contrast this with imperialism, which\ninvolves indirect forms of domination. Like colonialism, imperialism\nalso involves political and economic control over a dependent\nterritory. The etymology of the two terms, however, provides some\nclues about how they differ. The term colony comes from the Latin word\ncolonus, meaning farmer. This root reminds us that the\npractice of colonialism usually involved the transfer of population to\na new territory, where the arrivals lived as permanent settlers while\nmaintaining political allegiance to their country of origin.\nImperialism, on the other hand, comes from the Latin term\nimperium, meaning to command. Thus, the term imperialism\ndraws attention to the way that one country exercises power over\nanother, whether through settlement, sovereignty, or indirect\nmechanisms of control.\n\nThe confusion about the meaning of the term imperialism reflects the\nway that the concept has changed over time. Although the English word\nimperialism was not commonly used before the nineteenth century,\nElizabethans already described the United Kingdom as \u201cthe\nBritish Empire.\u201d As Britain began to acquire overseas\ndependencies, the concept of empire was employed more frequently.\nImperialism was understood as a system of military domination and\nsovereignty over territories. The day to day work of government might\nbe exercised indirectly through local assemblies or indigenous rulers\nwho paid tribute, but sovereignty rested with the British. The shift\naway from this traditional understanding of empire was influenced by\nthe Leninist analysis of imperialism as a system oriented towards\neconomic exploitation. According to Lenin, imperialism was the\nnecessary and inevitable result of the logic of accumulation in late\ncapitalism. Thus, for Lenin and subsequent Marxists, imperialism\ndescribed a historical stage of capitalism rather than a\ntrans-historical practice of political and military domination. The\nlasting impact of the Marxist approach is apparent in contemporary\ndebates about American imperialism, a term which usually means\nAmerican economic hegemony, regardless of whether such power is\nexercised directly or indirectly (Young 2001).\n\nGiven the difficulty of consistently distinguishing between the two\nterms, this entry will use colonialism as a broad concept that refers\nto the project of European political domination that began in the\nearly sixteenth century. While the national liberation movements of\nthe post-World War II era brought formal colonization to an end in\nmany parts of the world, Indigenous peoples still live in\nsettler-colonial states, and there are on-going struggles to reclaim\ncontrol of traditional territories. Post-colonialism will be used to\ndescribe the political and theoretical struggles of societies that\nexperienced the transition from political dependence to sovereignty.\nThis entry will use imperialism as a broad term that refers to\neconomic, military, political domination that is achieved without\nsignificant permanent European settlement.\n2. Natural Law and the Conquest of the Americas\n\nThe Spanish conquest of the Americas sparked a theological, political,\nand ethical debate about the use of military force to acquire control\nover foreign lands. This debate took place within the framework of a\nreligious discourse that legitimized military conquest as a way to\nfacilitate the conversion and salvation of indigenous peoples. The\nidea of a \u201ccivilizing mission\u201d was by no means the\ninvention of the British in the nineteenth century. The Spanish\nconquistadores and colonists explicitly justified their activities in\nthe Americas in terms of a religious mission to bring Christianity to\nthe native peoples. The Crusades provided the initial impetus for\ndeveloping a legal doctrine that rationalized the conquest and\npossession of lands that were held by non-Christians. Whereas the\nCrusades were initially framed as defensive wars to reclaim Christian\nlands that had been conquered, the resulting theoretical innovations\nplayed an important role in subsequent attempts to justify the\nconquest of the Americas. The core claim was that the \u201cPetrine\nmandate\u201d to care for the souls of Christ\u2019s human flock\nrequired Papal jurisdiction over temporal as well as spiritual\nmatters, and this control extended to non-believers as well as\nbelievers.\n\nThe conversion of the native peoples, however, did not provide an\nunproblematic justification for the project of overseas conquest. The\nSpanish conquest of the Americas was taking place during a period of\nreform when humanist scholars within the Church were increasingly\ninfluenced by the natural law theories of theologians such as St.\nThomas Aquinas. According to Pope Innocent IV, war could not be waged\nagainst infidels and they could not be deprived of their property\nsimply because of their non-belief. Under the influence of Thomism,\nInnocent IV concluded that force was legitimate only in cases where\ninfidels violated natural law. Nonbelievers had legitimate dominion\nover themselves and their property, but this dominion was abrogated if\nthey proved incapable of governing themselves according to principles\nthat every reasonable person would recognize. The Spanish quickly\nconcluded that the habits of the native Americans, from nakedness to\nunwillingness to labor to alleged cannibalism, clearly demonstrated\ntheir inability to recognize natural law. This account of native\ncustoms was used to legitimize the enslavement of the Indians, which\nthe Spanish colonists insisted was the only way to teach them\ncivilization and introduce them to Christianity.\n\nSome of the Spanish missionaries sent to the New World, however,\nnoticed that the brutal exploitation of slave labor was widespread\nwhile any serious commitment to religious instruction was absent.\nMembers of the Dominican order in particular noted the hypocrisy of\nenslaving the indigenous peoples because of their alleged barbarity\nwhile practicing a form of conquest, warfare, and slavery that reduced\nthe indigenous population of Hispaniola from 250,000 to 15,000 in two\ndecades of Spanish rule. Given the genocidal result of Spanish\n\u201ccivilization,\u201d they began to question the idea of a\ncivilizing mission. Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas and Franciscus de\nVictoria were two of the most influential critics of Spanish colonial\npractice. Victoria gave a series of lectures on Indian rights that\napplied Thomism to the practice of Spanish rule. He argued that all\nhuman beings share the capacity for rationality and have natural\nrights that stem from this capacity. From this premise, he deduced\nthat the Papal decision to grant Spain title to the Americas was\nillegitimate. Unlike the position of Pope Innocent IV, Victoria argued\nthat neither the Pope nor the Spaniards could subjugate the Indians in\norder to punish violations of natural law, such as fornication or\nadultery. He noted that the Pope had no right to make war on\nChristians and take their property simply because they were\n\u201cfornicators or thieves.\u201d If this were the case, then no\nEuropean king\u2019s dominion would ever be safe. Furthermore,\naccording to Victoria, the pope and Christian rulers acting on his\nmandate had even less right to enforce laws against unbelievers,\nbecause they were outside of the Christian community, which was the\ndomain of Papal authority (Williams 1990).\n\nDespite this strongly worded critique of the dominant modes of\njustifying Spanish conquest, Victoria concluded that the use of force\nin the New World was legitimate when Indian communities violated the\nLaw of Nations, a set of principles derivable from reason and\ntherefore universally binding. At first it might sound contradictory\nthat the Indians\u2019 supposed violation of the natural law did not\njustify conquest but their violation of the Law of Nations, itself\nderived from natural law, did. Victoria emphasizes that the Law of\nNations is binding because \u201cthere exists clearly enough a\nconsensus of the greater part of the whole world\u201d (391) and\nbecause the principles benefit \u201cthe common good of all.\u201d\nThis distinction seems to rely on the assumption that other principles\nusually associated with natural law (such as the prohibitions on\nadultery and idolatry) only affect those who consent to the practices,\nwhereas violations of the Law of Nations (e.g. prohibitions on\npeaceful travel and trade) have consequences for those who do not\nconsent. Ultimately, Victoria\u2019s understanding of the Law of\nNations led him to defend the practice of Spanish colonialism, even\nthough he emphasized that warfare should be limited to the measures\nrequired to attain the legitimate objectives of peaceful trade and\nmissionary work. Within Victoria\u2019s critique of the legality and\nmorality of Spanish colonialism was a rationalization for conquest,\nalbeit a restrictive one.\n3. Liberalism and Empire\n\nThe legitimacy of colonialism was also a topic of debate among French,\nGerman, and British philosophers in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies. Enlightenment thinkers such as Kant, Smith and Diderot were\ncritical of the barbarity of colonialism and challenged the idea that\nEuropeans had the obligation to \u201ccivilize\u201d the rest of the\nworld. The colonial system of slavery, land theft, and feudal labor\nwas antithetical to the principles of freedom and self-government. The\nrise of anti-colonial political theory, however, required more than a\nuniversalistic ethic that recognized the shared humanity of all\npeople. Given the powerful economic interests in the control of\nIndigenous land and the exploitation of Indigenous labor, universalism\nproved to be a relatively weak basis for criticizing colonialism.\n\nOne of the key issues that distinguished critics from proponents of\ncolonialism and imperialism was their view of the relationship between\nculture, history and progress. Many of the influential philosophers\nwriting in France and England in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies had assimilated some version of the developmental approach\nto history that was associated with the Scottish Enlightenment.\nAccording to the stadial theory of historical development, all\nsocieties naturally moved from hunting, to herding, to farming, to\ncommerce, a developmental process that simultaneously tracked a\ncultural arc from \u201csavagery,\u201d through\n\u201cbarbarism,\u201d to \u201ccivilization.\u201d\n\u201cCivilization\u201d was not just a marker of material\nimprovement, but also a normative judgment about the moral progress of\nsociety. (Kohn and O\u2019Neill 2006)\n\nThe language of civilization, savagery, and barbarism is pervasive in\nwriters as diverse of Edmund Burke, Karl Marx, and John Stuart Mill.\nIt would therefore be incorrect to conclude that a developmental\ntheory of history is distinctive of the liberal tradition;\nnevertheless, given that figures of the Scottish Enlightenment such as\nFerguson and Smith were among its leading expositors, it is strongly\nassociated with liberalism. Smith himself opposed imperialism for\neconomic reasons. He felt that relations of dependence between\nmetropole and periphery distorted self-regulating market mechanisms\nand worried that the cost of military domination would be burdensome\nfor taxpayers (Pitts 2005). The idea that civilization is the\nculmination of a process of historical development, however, proved\nuseful in justifying imperialism. According to Uday Mehta, liberal\nimperialism was the product of the interaction between universalism\nand developmental history (1999). A core doctrine of liberalism holds\nthat all individuals share a capacity for reason and self-government.\nThe theory of developmental history, however, modifies this\nuniversalism with the notion that these capacities only emerge at a\ncertain stage of civilization (McCarthy 2009). For example, according\nto John Stuart Mill (hereafter Mill), savages do not have the capacity\nfor self-government because of their excessive love of freedom. Serfs,\nslaves, and peasants in barbarous societies, on the other hand, may be\nso schooled in obedience that their capacity for rationality is\nstifled. Only commercial society produces the material and cultural\nconditions that enable individuals to realize their potential for\nfreedom and self-government. According to this logic, civilized\nsocieties like Great Britain are acting in the interest of\nless-developed peoples by governing them. Imperialism, from this\nperspective, is not primarily a form of political domination and\neconomic exploitation but rather a paternalistic practice of\ngovernment that exports \u201ccivilization\u201d (e.g.\nmodernization) in order to foster the improvement of native peoples.\nDespotic government (and Mill doesn\u2019t hesitate to use this term)\nis a means to the end of improvement and ultimately\nself-government.\n\nMill, a life-long employee of the British East India Company,\nrecognized that despotic government by a foreign people could lead to\ninjustice and economic exploitation. These abuses, if unchecked, could\nundermine the legitimacy and efficacy of the imperial project. In\nConsiderations on Representative Government (1861), Mill\nidentifies four reasons why foreign (e.g. European) peoples are not\nsuited to governing colonies. First, foreign politicians are unlikely\nto have the knowledge of local conditions that is necessary to solve\nproblems of public policy effectively. Second, given cultural,\nlinguistic, and often religious differences between colonizers and\ncolonized, the colonizers are unlikely to sympathize with the native\npeoples and are likely to act tyrannically. Third, even if the\ncolonizers really try to treat the native peoples fairly, their\nnatural tendency to sympathize with those similar to themselves (other\nforeign colonists or merchants) would likely lead to distorted\njudgment in cases of conflict. Finally, according to Mill, colonists\nand merchants go abroad in order to acquire wealth with little effort\nor risk, which means that their economic activity often exploits the\ncolonized country rather than developing it. These arguments echo\npoints made in Edmund Burke\u2019s voluminous writings assailing the\nmisgovernment in India, most notably Burke\u2019s famous Speech on\nFox\u2019s East India Bill (1783). Recent scholarship, however, has\nchallenged the view of Burke as an opponent of imperialism. Daniel\nO\u2019Neill has argued that Burke was a staunch supporter of the\nBritish Empire in the eighteenth century (2016). According to\nO\u2019Neill, Burke\u2019s defense of empire was ideologically\nconsistent with his conservative opposition to the French\nRevolution.\n\nMill\u2019s solution to the problem of imperial misgovernment was to\neschew parliamentary oversight in favor of a specialized\nadministrative corps. Members of this specialized body would have the\ntraining to acquire relevant knowledge of local conditions. Paid by\nthe government, they would not personally benefit from economic\nexploitation and could fairly arbitrate conflicts between colonists\nand indigenous people. Mill, however, was not able to explain how to\nensure good government where those wielding political power were not\naccountable to the population. In this sense, Mill\u2019s writing is\nemblematic of the failure of liberal imperial thought.\n\nNineteenth century liberal thinkers held a range of views on the\nlegitimacy of foreign domination and conquest. Alexis de Tocqueville,\nfor example, made a case for colonialism that did not rely on the idea\nof a \u201ccivilizing mission.\u201d Tocqueville recognized that\ncolonialism probably did not bring good government to the native\npeoples, but this did not lead him to oppose colonialism since his\nsupport rested entirely on the way it benefited France. Tocqueville\ninsisted that French colonies in Algeria would increase France\u2019s\nstature vis-\u00e0-vis rivals like England. Colonies would provide\nan outlet for excess population that caused disorder in France.\nTocqueville also suggested that imperial endeavors would incite a\nfeeling of patriotism that would counterbalance the modern centrifugal\nforces of materialism and class conflict.\n\nTocqueville was actively engaged in advancing the project of French\ncolonization of Algeria. Tocqueville\u2019s first analysis of French\ncolonialism was published during his 1837 electoral campaign for a\nseat in the Chamber of Deputies. As a member of the Chamber of\nDeputies, Tocqueville argued in favor of expanding the French presence\nin Algeria. He traveled to Algeria in 1841 composing an \u201cEssay\non Algeria\u201d that served as the basis for two parliamentary\nreports on the topic (Tocqueville 1841). Unlike the more na\u00efve\nproponents of the \u201ccivilizing mission,\u201d Tocqueville\nadmitted that the brutal military occupation did little to introduce\ngood government or advance civilization. In an apparent reversal of\nthe four-stages theory of the Scottish Enlightenment, he acknowledged\nthat \u201cwe are now fighting far more barbarously than the Arabs\nthemselves\u201d and \u201cit is on their side that one meets with\ncivilization.\u201d (Tocqueville 1841: 70) This realization, however,\ndid not imply a critique of French brutality. Instead, Tocqueville\ndefended controversial tactics such as the destruction of crops,\nconfiscation of land, and seizure of unarmed civilians. His texts,\nhowever, provide little in the way of philosophical justification and\nhe dismisses the entire just war tradition by stating, \u201cI\nbelieve that the right of war authorizes us to ravage the\ncountry.\u201d (Tocqueville 1841: 70). In Tocqueville\u2019s\nwritings on Algeria, the French national interest is paramount and\nmoral considerations are explicitly subordinate to political\ngoals.\n\nTocqueville\u2019s analysis of Algeria reflects little anxiety about\nits legitimacy and much concern about the pragmatics of effective\ncolonial governance. The stability of the regime, he felt, depended on\nthe ability of the colonial administration to provide good government\nto the French settlers. Tocqueville emphasized that the excessive\ncentralization of decision-making in Paris combined with the arbitrary\npractices of the local military leadership meant that French colonists\nhad no security of property, let alone the political and civil rights\nthat they were accustomed to France. Tocqueville was untroubled by the\nuse of martial law against indigenous peoples, but felt that it was\ncounterproductive when applied to the French. For Tocqueville, the\nsuccess of the French endeavor in Algeria depended entirely on\nattracting large numbers of permanent French settlers. Given that it\nwas proving impossible to win the allegiance of the indigenous people,\nFrance could not hold Algeria without creating a stable community of\ncolonists. The natives were to be ruled through military domination\nand the French were to be enticed to settle through the promise of\neconomic gain in an environment that reproduced, as much as possible,\nthe cultural and political life of France. After a brief period of\noptimism about \u201camalgamation\u201d of the races in his\n\u201cSecond Letter on Algeria\u201d (Tocqueville 1837: 25),\nTocqueville understood the colonial world in terms of the permanent\nopposition of settler and native, an opposition structured to ensure\nthe economic benefit of the former.\n4. Marxism and Leninism\n\nIn recent years, scholars have devoted less attention to the debates\non colonialism within the Marxist tradition. This reflects the waning\ninfluence of Marxism in the academy and in political practice.\nMarxism, however, has influenced both post-colonial theory and\nanti-colonial independence movements around the world. Marxists have\ndrawn attention to the material basis of European political expansion\nand developed concepts that help explain the persistence of economic\nexploitation after the end of direct political rule.\n\nAlthough Marx never developed a theory of colonialism, his analysis of\ncapitalism emphasized its inherent tendency to expand in search of new\nmarkets. In his classic works such as The Communist\nManifesto, Grundrisse, and Capital, Marx\npredicted that the bourgeoisie would continue to create a global\nmarket and undermine both local and national barriers to its own\nexpansion. Expansion is a necessary product of the core dynamic of\ncapitalism: overproduction. Competition among producers drives them to\ncut wages, which in turn leads to a crisis of under-consumption. The\nonly way to prevent economic collapse is to find new markets to absorb\nexcess consumer goods. From a Marxist perspective, some form of\nimperialism is inevitable. By exporting population to resource rich\nforeign territories, a nation creates a market for industrial goods\nand a reliable source of natural resources. Alternately, weaker\ncountries can face the choice of either voluntarily admitting foreign\nproducts that will undermine domestic industry or submitting to\npolitical domination, which will accomplish the same end.\n\nIn a series of newspaper articles published in the 1850s in the\nNew York Daily Tribune, Marx specifically discussed the\nimpact of British colonialism in India. His analysis was consistent\nwith his general theory of political and economic change. He described\nIndia as an essentially feudal society experiencing the painful\nprocess of modernization. According to Marx, however, Indian\n\u201cfeudalism\u201d was a distinctive form of economic\norganization. He reached this conclusion because he believed\n(incorrectly) that agricultural land in India was owned communally.\nMarx used the concept of \u201cOriental despotism\u201d to describe\na specific type of class domination that used the state\u2019s power\nof taxation in order to extract resources from the peasantry.\nAccording to Marx, oriental despotism emerged in India because\nagricultural productivity depended on large-scale public works such as\nirrigation that could only be financed by the state. This meant that\nthe state could not be easily replaced by a more decentralized system\nof authority. In Western Europe, feudal property could be transformed\ngradually into privately owned, alienable property in land. In India,\ncommunal land ownership made this impossible, thereby blocking the\ndevelopment of commercial agriculture and free markets. Since\n\u201cOriental despotism\u201d inhibited the indigenous development\nof economic modernization, British domination became the agent of\neconomic modernization.\n\nMarx\u2019s analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing\nmodernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent\nrationalization for foreign domination. His account of British\ndomination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that he shows\ntowards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Marx recognizes the\nimmense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to\nbourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both\nnecessary and ultimately progressive. He argues that the penetration\nof foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India. For Marx,\nthis upheaval has both positive and negative consequences. When\npeasants lose their traditional livelihoods, there is a great deal of\nhuman suffering, but he also points out that traditional village\ncommunities are hardly idyllic; they are sites of caste oppression,\nslavery, misery, and cruelty. The first stage of the modernization\nprocess is entirely negative, because poor people pay heavy taxation\nto support British rule and endure the economic upheaval that results\nfrom the glut of cheaply produced English cotton. Eventually, however,\nBritish merchants begin to realize that Indians cannot pay for\nimported cloth or British administration if they don\u2019t\nefficiently produce goods to trade, which provides an incentive for\nBritish investment in production and infrastructure. Even though Marx\nbelieved that British rule was motivated by greed and exercised\nthrough cruelty, he felt it was still the agent of progress. Thus,\nMarx\u2019s discussion of British rule in India has three dimensions:\nan account of the progressive character of foreign rule, a critique of\nthe human suffering involved, and a concluding argument that British\nrule must be temporary if the progressive potential is to be\nrealized.\n\nLenin developed his analysis of Western economic and political\ndomination in his pamphlet Imperialism: The Highest Stage of\nCapitalism (1917) (see Other Internet Resources). Lenin took a\nmore explicitly critical view of imperialism. He noted that\nimperialism was a technique which allowed European countries to put\noff the inevitable domestic revolutionary crisis by exporting their\nown economic burdens onto weaker states. Lenin argued that\nlate-nineteenth century imperialism was driven by the economic logic\nof late-capitalism. The falling rate of profit caused an economic\ncrisis that could only be resolved through territorial expansion.\nCapitalist conglomerates were compelled to expand beyond their\nnational borders in pursuit of new markets and resources. In a sense,\nthis analysis is fully consistent with Marx, who saw European\ncolonialism as continuous with the process of internal expansion\nwithin states and across Europe. Both Marx and Lenin thought that\ncolonialism and imperialism resulted from the same logic that drove\nthe economic development and modernization of peripheral areas in\nEurope. But there was one distinctive element of Lenin\u2019s\nanalysis. Since late capitalism was organized around national\nmonopolies, the competition for markets took the form of military\ncompetition between states over territories that could be dominated\nfor their exclusive economic benefit.\n\nMarxist theorists including Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Kautsky, and Nikolai\nBukharin also explored the issue of imperialism. Kautsky\u2019s\nposition is especially important because his analysis introduced\nconcepts that continue to play a prominent role in contemporary world\nsystems theory and post-colonial studies. Kautsky challenges the\nassumption that imperialism would lead to the development of the areas\nsubjected to economic exploitation. He suggests that imperialism is a\nrelatively permanent relationship structuring the interactions between\ntwo types of countries. (Young 2001) Although imperialism initially\ntook the form of military competition between capitalist countries, it\nwould result in collusion between capitalist interests to maintain a\nstable system of exploitation of the non-developed world. The most\ninfluential contemporary proponent of this view is Immanuel\nWallerstein, who is known for world-systems theory. According to this\ntheory, the world-system is a relatively stable set of relations\nbetween core and peripheral states. This international division of\nlabor is structured to benefit the core states (Wallerstein\n1974\u20131989) and transfers resources from the periphery to the\ncore.\n5. Theories of Decolonization and Post-colonial Theory\n\nFrantz Fanon was one of the leading theorists of the struggle for\ndecolonization. His two most influential works focused on anti-black\nracism and the impact of colonial violence. Black Skin, White\nMasks (2008 [1952]) describes racialized subjectivity and the\nstructural conditions that sustain racial domination. Drawing on\nexistentialism, psychoanalysis, and literary theory, Fanon\ndemonstrates the constitutive effects of European colonialism on\nidentity. It details the traumatic consequences of immersion in a\ncultural framework that pathologizes blackness, thereby dividing the\nracialized subject. Wretched of the Earth (1961) was the\nmost influential philosophical account of the anti-colonial struggle\nand the challenges of post-colonial governance. The book provides a\ncomplex account of the relationship between violence and liberation.\nViolence is the foundation of the colonial regime, and therefore\ninevitably plays a role in its overthrow, but Fanon also explores its\npsychological dimension. Revolutionary violence can be a productive\nredirection of the internalized violence characteristic of the\nexperience of oppression because it can bring about structural change.\nIt is also a praxis that generates political agency, group cohesion\nand national identity. Wretched of the Earth also includes\nincisive reflections on the way that colonial states continue to exert\neconomic power after independence. According to Fanon, the economic\nexploitation typical of colonialism can be secured in a new way\nthrough the leadership of the comprador bourgeoisie, a segment of the\nindigenous managerial class that is allied with foreign economic\ninterests. He also suggests that collective identity based on\nethnicity or national consciousness can have harmful effects, when it\nfunctions ideologically to mask class differences in service of elite\neconomic interests. Fanon\u2019s Marxist-influenced approach to\nanti-colonial critique is part of a black radical traditional that\nincludes other Caribbean thinkers such as Eric Williams, whose book\nCapitalism and Slavery (1994) demonstrated that the wealth\nextracted from sugar plantations bankrolled the industrial revolution\nand C.L.R James\u2019s The Black Jacobins (1989), which\nretold the story of the Haitian Revolution from the perspective of the\nvictorious revolutionaries. These books were foundational for\ntheories of racial capitalism, a position that holds that racialized\nexploitation and capital accumulation are mutually reinforcing.\n(Robinson 2000)\n\nAnother seminal critic of colonialism is Mahatma Gandhi. He is\nremembered for his leadership of the Indian independence movement, his\ncritique of British colonialism, and his theory of political\nresistance. Among his theoretical innovations is the concept of\nsatyagraha. While the literal meaning is closer to\n\u201cholding on to truth,\u201d the term is often used to describe\nnon-violent resistance or civil disobedience. According to Gandhi, it\nis through the practice of non-cooperation with oppression that the\nforce of truth is animated. The central place of non-violence in\nGandhi\u2019s theory and practice reflects the influence of the Hindu\nconcept ahimsa, or avoiding harm, but this principle was\ntransformed in the context of anti-colonial struggle. Gandhi was a\nprolific writer who was deeply engaged in theoretical and political\ndebates. Among his influential writings was the book Hind\nSwaraj (1997), published in 1909. It takes the form of a dialogue\nbetween a Reader and an Editor. The text provides an account of\nBritish domination in India, an analysis of the meaning of\nswaraj (self-rule), a discussion of political strategy, and a\ncritique of Western civilization. Gandhi denaturalizes \u201cWestern\ncivilization\u201d by showing that the underlying materialism is not\nnormatively justified and the alleged benefits of colonialism (modern\nmedicine, technology) are actually harmful to the human condition. He\nalso shows that the colonists fail in their own terms, pointing out\nthat the European colonists claimed to bring civilization but cemented\ntheir rule by engaging in brutal violence.\n\nContemporary literary theorists have also drawn attention to practices\nof representation that reproduce a logic of subordination that endures\neven after former colonies gain independence. The field of\npostcolonial studies was influenced by Edward Said\u2019s\npath-breaking book Orientalism. In Orientalism Said\napplied Michel Foucault\u2019s technique of discourse analysis to the\nproduction of knowledge about the Middle East. The term orientalism\ndescribed a structured set of concepts, assumptions, and discursive\npractices that were used to produce, interpret, and evaluate knowledge\nabout non-European peoples. Said\u2019s analysis made it possible for\nscholars to deconstruct literary and historical texts in order to\nunderstand how they reflected and reinforced the imperialist project.\nUnlike previous studies that focused on the economic or political\nlogics of colonialism, Said drew attention to the relationship between\nknowledge and power. By foregrounding the cultural and epistemological\nwork of imperialism, Said was able to undermine the ideological\nassumption of value-free knowledge and show that \u201cknowing the\nOrient\u201d was part of the project of dominating it.\nOrientalism can be seen as an attempt to extend the\ngeographical and historical terrain of the poststructuralist critique\nof Western epistemology.\n\nSaid uses the term orientalism in several different ways. First,\norientalism is a specific field of academic study about the Middle\nEast and Asia, albeit one that Said conceives quite expansively to\nencompass history, sociology, literature, anthropology and especially\nphilology. He also identifies it as a practice that helps define\nEurope by creating a stable depiction of its other, its constitutive\noutside. Orientalism is a way of characterizing Europe by drawing a\ncontrasting image or idea, based on a series of binary oppositions\n(rational/irrational, mind/body, order/chaos) that manage and displace\nEuropean anxieties. Finally, Said emphasizes that it is also a mode of\nexercising authority by organizing and classifying knowledge about the\nOrient. This discursive approach is distinct both from the materialist\nview that knowledge is simply a reflection of economic or political\ninterests and from the idealist view that scholarship is disinterested\nand neutral. Following Foucault, Said describes discourse as a form of\nknowledge that is not used instrumentally in service of power but\nrather is itself a form of power.\n\nThe second quasi-canonical contribution to the field of post-colonial\ntheory is Gayatri Spivak\u2019s \u201cCan the Subaltern\nSpeak?\u201d (1988). Spivak works within Said\u2019s problematic of\nrepresentation but extends it to the contemporary academy. Spivak\nquestions the idea of transparent subaltern speech. When well-meaning\nscholars want to let the subaltern \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d\nthey hope that removing the intermediary (the expert, the judge, the\nimperial administrator, the local elite) will enable some authentic\ntruth based on experience to emerge. But experience itself is\nconstituted through representation; therefore denying the problem of\nrepresentation does not make it go away but only makes it harder to\nrecognize. The central claim of the essay is that\n\u201crepresentation has not withered away.\u201d Since power is\neverywhere, even in language itself, transparency and authenticity are\nimpossible; this means that the messy and controversial work of\ninterpretation is necessary.\n\nAijaz Ahmad has argued that, despite Spivak\u2019s claims to be\nworking within the Marxist tradition, her essays exhibit contempt for\nmaterialism, rationalism, and progress, the core features of Marxism\n(Ahmad 1997). According to Ahmad, Spivak is concerned with narratives\nof capitalism rather than the institutional structures and material\neffects of capitalism as a mode of production. Spivak\u2019s sharp\ncriticism of movements that essentialize subaltern subjects casts\ndoubt on the basic premise of Marxist politics, which privileges the\nproletariat as a group with shared, true interests that are produced\nby the capitalist system.\n\nVivek Chibber (2013) and Dipesh Chakrabarty (2007) have taken up these\nissues. In his influential book Provincializing Europe,\nChakrabarty argues that distinctively European concepts such as\ndisenchanted space, secular time, and sovereignty inform the social\nsciences. When these standards are treated as universal, the third\nworld is seen as incomplete or lacking. Chibber challenges the\nposition. Chibber advances a critique of Subaltern Studies and defends\nuniversal categories such as capitalism, class, rationality, and\nobjectivity. He argues that these categories need not be reductionist\nor Eurocentric and that they are useful in illuminating the motivation\nof political actors and the structural constraints faced by leaders in\ncountries such as India.\n\nThis debate reflects a tension that runs through the field of\npostcolonial studies. Although some thinkers draw on both Marxism and\npoststructuralism, the two theories have different goals, methods, and\nassumptions. In the humanities, postcolonial theory tends to reflect\nthe influence of poststructuralist thought, while theorists of\ndecolonization focus on social history, economics, and political\ninstitutions. Whereas postcolonial theory is associated with the\nissues of hybridity, diaspora, representation, narrative, and\nknowledge/power, theories of decolonization are concerned with\nrevolution, economic inequality, violence, and political identity.\n\nSome scholars have begun to question the usefulness of the concept\npost-colonial theory. Like the idea of the Scottish four-stages\ntheory, a theory with which it would appear to have little in common,\nthe very concept of post-colonialism seems to rely on a progressive\nunderstanding of history (McClintock 1992). It suggests, perhaps\nunwittingly, that the core concepts of hybridity, alterity,\nparticularity, and multiplicity may lead to a kind of methodological\ndogmatism or developmental logic. Moreover, the term\n\u201ccolonial\u201d as a marker of this domain of inquiry is also\nproblematic in so far as it suggests historically implausible\ncommonalities across territories that experienced very different\ntechniques of domination. Thus, the critical impulse behind\npost-colonial theory has turned on itself, drawing attention to the\nway that it may itself be marked by the utopian desire to transcend\nthe trauma of colonialism (Gandhi 1998).\n6. Recognition and Revolt in Settler-Colonial States \n\nIndigenous scholars have articulated a critique of post-colonialism,\nnoting that the concept obscures the continued existence of settler\ncolonialism. Decolonization within setter states is framed through an\nethics of reconciliation, which recognizes the historical and ongoing\neffects of colonization and aims at establishing a mutually respectful\nframework for a sustainable nation to nation relationship between\nsettler and Indigenous peoples. The theoretical literature on settler\ncolonialism includes a diverse range of positions that offer different\nassessments of approaches focused on reconciliation and resurgence. A\npoint of controversy in contemporary Indigenous political theory\nliterature is the extent to which it is desirable to participate in\ncolonial and political institutions in order to transform them. A\ncentral tension that underlies this controversy is whether\ninstitutional accommodation aimed toward reconciliation advanced an\nidea of self-determination that is defined through Indigenous\ninterests, cosmologies, and ethics or further reproduces the\nconditions of domination that only perpetuate the historical\nsettler-colonial relationship.\n\nScholars such as Dale Turner suggests that it is possible to achieve\nsuccessful reconciliation through Western practices of democratic\ndeliberation and procedures. In This is Not a Peace Pipe: Toward a\nCritical Indigenous Philosophy (2006), Turner emphasizes that the\nway to undermine the power dynamics that perpetuate the conditions of\ncolonialism is through participation within the legal and political\ninstitutions of the state. He argues that \u201cword warriors,\u201d\nwho mediate between Indigenous communities and legal and political\ninstitutions, should ensure the preservation and expansion of\nIndigenous rights within the larger community. Turner further suggests\nthat an effective relationship between settler states and Indigenous\npeoples will only emerge from a dialogue grounded in democratic\npresumptions of equality and respect. This dialogue entails that\nIndigenous peoples, in order to establish claims of cultural\ndistinctiveness, must learn how to engage within settler states\u2019\nlegal and political discourses in more effective ways (2006:5).\n\nIn their essay \u201cDecolonization is Not a Metaphor\u201d (2012)\nEve Tuck and Wayne Yang criticize settler worldviews for failing to\nacknowledge the distinct, totalizing effect of settler colonialism.\nThey emphasize that settler colonialism operates through the\nexploitation and expropriation of Indigenous worlds by privileging\ncolonial economies while simultaneously involving the use of\nparticularized modes of control, such as schools and policing, to\nensure and legitimize progress and development in accordance with\nsettler epistemologies and ontologies. In this sense,\nsettler-colonialism is a structure rather than an event (Wolfe 1999)\nthat reinforces the total appropriation of Indigenous life and land.\nTuck and Yang describe contemporary approaches to reconciliation as\n\u201cmoves to innocence\u201d that reconcile settler guilt while\nsecuring the future of settler colonialism.\n\nA prominent idea that is brought up in the struggle for Indigenous\nself-determination is the Doctrine of Discovery. Settlers claimed\ndiscovery from the normative political and legal view of terra\nnullius, which translates to \u201cempty land.\u201d Scholars\nof Indigenous resurgence argue that doctrines of discovery and terra\nnullius persist in the present period within recognition-based methods\nof reconciliation, and they stifle movements of self-determination.\nTheorists of Indigenous resurgence advance an understanding of\ndecolonization that refuses contemporary settler-colonial methods of\ninstitutional and cultural accommodation while reviving Indigenous\nlegal and political institutions and ways of being. Leanne\nBetasamosake Simpson points out that rebuilding needs to start from\nwithin, and Indigenous people require not only the re-establishment of\npre-colonial history and languages but also the introduction of\nIndigenous custom and forms of governance that re-center a grounded\nnormativity, which is a norm guided by ancestral land-based\nrelationships and practices. This can build on the oral tradition of\nstorytelling, which is a framework that informs social experience.\nMost recently, in Short History of Blockades (2021) Simpson\nargues that practices of blockading represent both a negation of\nsettler colonial states and the affirmation or amplification of\nIndigenous futurity that directly addresses the implications of\ncontinual dispossession and domination by rebuilding relations of\nself-determination.\n\nIn Red Skin, White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of\nRecognition (2014), Glen Coulthard deepens the theoretical\nframework of resurgence and refusal by arguing that the current\nframework of reconciliation tends to dehistoricize and neutralize acts\nof dispossession, violence, and displacement of Indigenous peoples\nfrom their lands and culture. For Coulthard, settler colonialism is an\nongoing process emergent in settler institutions and structures of\nrecognition, not merely the legacy of past injustices. This is evident\nin unsettled land claims, the dispossession of land, the limitations\nplaced on Indigenous governments, and the displacement of Indigenous\nways of life that are tied to access to traditional territories.\nRather than relying on recognition from within the colonial-settler\nrelationship, Coulthard calls for an Indigenous sovereignty informed\nby an intellectual, social, political, and artistic movement that\nembodies a \u201cself-reflective revitalization\u201d of traditional\nvalues, principles, and cultural practices.\n\nThe title of Coulthard\u2019s book alludes to Black Skin, White\nMasks (2008), the path breaking work by Frantz Fanon. Writing in\n1950s, Fanon challenged the abstract universalism of Western\nphilosophy, showing how universalism serves to structure a\nhierarchical relationship between settler and colonized. Fanon\u2019s\ncritical theory challenges the assumption that European notions of\nprogress truly advance justice and secure mutual benefit. In Black\nSkin, White Masks, Fanon focuses on the development of Black\nconsciousness by exploring the psychological alienation and\ndisplacement caused by colonial domination. He describes a divided\nself who identifies with French culture even while experiencing\nexclusion from the ideals of universalism, equality, and reason.\nCoulthard\u2019s reading of Fanon informs his view that cultural\nrecognition by the colonial state is not a solution. Following Fanon,\nhe concludes the paternalist recognition serves to legitimize the\ncolonial state and further divide Indigenous subjects.\n\nWhile international recognition-based models have gained momentum\nsince the 2007 United Nations Declaration of Rights of Indigenous\nPeoples (UNDRIP), their potential to establish Indigenous sovereignty\nand self-determination remains contested. Scholars such as Sheryl\nLightfoot (2016) highlight the revolutionary potential of\ninternational movements to enable a collective voice where local\nstruggles may strategically coalesce on a global platform. Others are\ncritical of UNDRIP as it remains formulated within a Westphalian\nsystem that fails to universally recognize the sovereignty of\nIndigenous law and practices in cases where it conflicts with settler\nlaw or territorial sovereignty (see Hayden King).\n\nIn her book Restructuring Relations: Indigenous\nSelf-Determination, Governance, and Gender (2019) Rauna Kuokkanen\nis skeptical of the ability of human rights frameworks, such as\nUNDRIP, to inform and express Indigenous self-determination. Drawing\nfrom Indigenous and feminist political and legal theory, Kuokkanen\nhighlights the way human rights frameworks and current models of\nIndigenous self-government are limited in their ability to adequately\naddress violence against women because of their focus on civil and\npolitical rights. As an alternative, Kuokkanen proposes a relational\ntheory of self-determination that recognizes that social and political\norders as interconnected and interdependent, which she contrasts with\na rights-based framework that fosters values of autonomy. Kuokkanen\npositions self-determination as a core value and traces the way\ncertain ideas and rights of self-determination both structure social\nand political experience and how this value could be transformed if\ninformed and developed through Indigenous ontologies based on the idea\nof integrity of both the land and the body alongside a freedom from\nbodily harm and violence.\n\nResurgence scholars aim to unsettle settler perspectives of\ncivilization through the revitalisation of Indigenous practices of\nresponsibility and relations with the natural world. Theorists within\nthis field reject all stadial theories of human development and the\nidea that history\u2019s direction is irreversible. Similar to\nGandhi, some Indigenous thinkers critique modern civilization as a\nprofound sickness destroying what is meaningful in human life,\ncharacterizing modern civilization as ailing and on the threshold of\nself-destruction (Henderson, 2017). These thinkers challenge the idea\nof a single authoritative account of politics guided by the ideas of\nEnlightenment rationality. Instead, they make a case for a new way of\ndoing politics that provides an alternative to the materialism and\nconsumerism of modern Western societies that develops through a close\nstudy of the values destroyed through colonialism. John Borrows\n(2008), for example, challenges settler understandings that shape\nhuman relationships and obligations to the earth by re-telling the\nidea of seven generations that exists in many Indigenous legal and\npolitical traditions. According to this approach, when making\njudgments in the present, we have duties of obligation to seven\ngenerations in the past and seven generations in the future.\n\nAlong the lines of colonial and post-colonial thinkers, like Gandhi,\nAim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Fanon, Indigenous political theorists do\nnot necessarily advocate for a reversion to historical or traditional\nways of living. Rather, Indigenous thinkers describe a new humanism\nwithin the context of settler colonialism that requires politics\nguided by a practice of truth-seeking from various perspectives. In\ntheir work Resurgence and Reconciliation: Indigenous-Settler\nRelations and Earth Teachings (2019), Michael Ash, John Borrows,\nand James Tully compile a collection of work that brings forward a\ntheoretical framework of reconciliation that is empowered by practices\nof resurgence. Decolonization in this sense is likened to the activity\nof the ancient sweetgrass braiders, which brings various independent\nstrands of branches, roots, filaments and fibre together in a strong\nbraid. This act of weaving \u2013 a predominantly female\napprenticeship \u2013 necessitates a deep understanding of\ncommunity life and its history, with a knowledge of patterns,\nimpressions, and conventions in both the natural and human world\n(2019:10).\n\nIndigenous political theory has developed into a robust scholarship\nthat calls for the radical responsibility of Indigenous nations for\ntheir own self-determination. This scholarship advocates for the\nemergence of a new set of values that develops not through privileging\na European conception of universalism but by sketching a conception of\nuniversalism that emerges from the co-existence of many particulars.\nThis emergent universalism assembles different worlds and ideas of\ncivilization by addressing issues surrounding land rights and cultural\ndistinctiveness.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ahmad, Aijaz, 1994. <em>In Theory: Classes, Nations,\nLiteratures</em>, London: Verso.", "Asch, M., Borrows, J., Tully, J., 2018. <em>Resurgence and\nReconciliation: Indigenous-Settler Relations and Earth Teachings</em>,\nToronto: University of Toronto Press.", "Bell, Duncan, 2016. <em>Reordering the World: Essays on Liberalism\nand Empire</em>, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.", "Burke, Edmund, 2000. <em>On Empire, Liberty and Reform: Speeches\nand Letters</em>, David Bromwich (ed.), New Haven: Yale University\nPress.", "Borrows, John, 2008. \u201cSeven Generations, Seven Teachings:\nEnding the Indian Act\u201d National Centre for First Nations\nGovernance.", "C\u00e9saire, Aim\u00e9, 1972. <em>Discourse on\nColonialism.</em> New York: Monthly Review Press", "Chakrabarty, Dipesh, 2007. <em>Provincializing Europe:\nPostcolonial Thought and Historical Difference</em>, New Jersey:\nPrinceton University Press.", "Chibber, Vivek, 2013. <em>Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of\nCapital</em>, London: Verso.", "Coulthard, Glen, 2014. <em>Red Skin, White Masks: Rejecting the\nColonial Politics of Recognition</em>, Minneapolis: University of\nMinnesota Press.", "Fanon, Frantz. 2005. <em>The Wretched of the Earth</em>.\nTranslated by Richard Philcox.
