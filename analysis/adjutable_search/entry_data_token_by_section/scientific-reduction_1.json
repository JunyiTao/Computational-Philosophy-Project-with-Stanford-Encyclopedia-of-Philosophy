    "main_text": "Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of science\n2. Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of science\n\nThe philosophical discussion of reduction-relations in the sciences\nwas inspired by cases such as the alleged reduction of Newtonian\nmechanics to relativity theory, of chemistry to atomic physics, and of\ngas laws to statistical mechanics. However, in what respects these\nactual episodes of theory change count as reductions is a complex\nmatter. Many factors might be relevant, not merely logical and\nmetaphysical relations but also epistemic, psychological, and\npragmatic ones. Questions also arose about the generalizability of\nthese cases and their role in scientific progress or change, which led\nto the idea that an appropriate model of reduction should mainly focus\non cases of actual theory succession. The main target in the reduction\ndebate within the philosophy of science, however, was not a\nreconstruction of the process of scientific change, but rather an\nexplication of the relation between successive theories that justified\nthe relevant change, i.e., relations alleged to hold between pairs of\ntheories such as Newtonian mechanics and relativity theory, or\nthermodynamics and statistical mechanics. In this context, the relata\nof reductions were conceived of as theories or models, rather than\nproperties, events, or kinds. Thus, they are often referred to as\n\u2018theory reductions\u2019.\n",
