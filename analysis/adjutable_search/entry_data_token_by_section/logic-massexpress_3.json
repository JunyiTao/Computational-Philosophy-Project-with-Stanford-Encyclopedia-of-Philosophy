    "main_text": "The purely mereological approach\n2. The purely mereological approach\n\n\nWe first consider the purely mereological approach (Moravcsik 1973),\nwhich uses mereological sums as the denotata of mass nouns, and\ninterprets mass predication (e.g., This is water) in terms of\nparthood.\n\n\nTake the noun water. The view is that this noun denotes the\nsum of all the water that there is. The notion of sum involved here\ncan be characterized formally, as done in mereology (cf. Varzi 2016, Cotnoir & Varzi forthcoming).\nIntuitively, suppose there is some water in a bottle, a, and\nsome water in a cup, b. Then we can also refer to the water in\nthe bottle and the cup. This is a bigger portion of water, the sum of\na and b, noted a\u2228b (or\na+b). a is part of a\u2228b, and so\nis b. More generally, we can sum all the portions of water\ntogether. This is a very big portion of water, which is the denotation\nof the noun water. Mass predication is then interpreted in\nterms of these associated notions of sum and parthood:\n\nThis is M is true iff [this] \u2264 [M],\n\n\nwhere [\u2009\u00b7\u2009] is the denotation function,\n[this] is the sum of what is demonstrated and [M] is\nthe sum of all M.  For instance:\n\n\nThis is water is true\niff [this] \u2264 [water], the sum of all water.\n\n\n\nHowever, this quickly runs into a problem, since there are parts of\nwater (e.g., oxygen) that are too small to count as water. Water seems\nto have \u201cminimal parts\u201d, smallest parts that count as water. (As said\nin section 1.2, this is even clearer with mass nouns like\nfurniture.)\n\n\nParsons (1970, reprinted in 1979: 150) points out a related\ndifficulty, the \u2018WOOD = FURNITURE\u2019 problem. Suppose that\nall wood is used to make up furniture and all furniture is made of\nwood. Then it would seem that the sum of the wood is identical with the\nsum of the furniture. Therefore, all sentences of the form The wood\nP and The furniture P are predicted to have the same\ntruth-value, for any predicate P. Yet, it might well be that\nThe furniture is heterogeneous is true, intuitively, while\nThe wood is heterogeneous is false.\nRemark 1: The purely mereological approach is usually understood in\nterms of classical extensional mereology. However, such an approach\ndoesn\u2019t seem to require the full power of this theory. The notion of\nsum used could be the join operation \u2228 in a join semi-lattice.\nAnd the notion of parthood employed could be the order relation \u2264\ndefined in this way: x \u2264 y =def x \u2228 y =\ny. The notion of join semi-lattice is more general and far less\nconstrained than classical extensional\n mereology (see Moltmann 1997, ch. 1, for other criticisms of the mereological\nextensional view).\nRemark 2: Thus, against Parsons, one may well want to deny that the\n(sum or join of the) wood is identical to the (sum or join of the)\nfurniture. Indeed, if the furniture is broken, it ceases to exist,\nwhile the wood does not. This line of argumentation is adopted more\ngenerally by those who deny the identity of a ship and the wood it is\nmade of, of a man and its molecules, etc. (cf. Wasserman 2012).\nParsons\u2019 argument is based on a controversial metaphysical\nassumption, one that a semantics of mass nouns need not\n make.[5]\n(See Steen 2012, section 2.2 and\nsupplement 1, for other metaphysical considerations concerning the\npurely mereological approach.)\nRemark 3: Indeed, Moravcsik (1973) proposes to do something of this\nkind in order to avoid the problem of minimal parts. The idea is to\nassociate to any mass noun its own part-whole relation. Let M\nbe a mass noun, [M] the sum it denotes, and\n\u2264M the associated part-whole relation. The sentence\nThis is M is represented as: [this]\n\u2264M [M]. Then, the leg of a table isn\u2019t a furniture-part of the furniture, so the problem of minimal\nparts is avoided.\nRemark 4: However, this doesn\u2019t account for the validity of\nsyllogisms like the following (Burge 1972: 266\u2013267):\n\nThis is gold. Gold is metal. Therefore, this is metal.\n\nPresumably, it represents it as follows:\n\n[this] \u2264GOLD [gold] &\n[gold] \u2264METAL [metal] \u2192 \n[this] \u2264METAL [metal]\n\nThis is invalid, since only a uniform part-whole relation could\nguarantee\n transitivity.[6]\n\nRemark 5: The purely mereological approach faces yet another, very\ngeneral problem. One still needs a uniform framework for doing\nsemantics: for proper names, singular count nouns, plurals, mass nouns,\nadjectives, verbs, etc. This has to be set theory, or something as\npowerful like \u201cnon-singular\u201d or \u201cplural\u201d logic\n(see section 9).\n",
