    "main_text": "Death || Death and Existence\n2.6 Death and Existence\n\nWhat is the relationship between existence and death? May people and\nother creatures continue to exist after dying, or cease to exist\nwithout dying?\n\nTake the first question: may you and I and other creatures continue to\nexist for some time after our lives end? Fred Feldman (1992, p. 91)\ncoins the term termination thesis to refer to the view that\n\u201cwhen a person dies, he or she \u2026 goes out of existence;\nsubsequently, there is no such thing as that person.\u201d (A version\nof the thesis applies to any living thing.) We can call those who\naccept the termination thesis terminators, and those who deny\nit anti-terminators. One point anti-terminators such as\nFeldman (1992, 2000, 2013) cite is that people who encounter corpses\nsometimes call them dead animals, or dead people. Such talk may\nsuggest that we believe that animals continue to exist, as animals,\nwhile no longer alive. The idea might be that an animal continues to\ncount as the same animal if enough of its original components remain\nin much the same order, and animals continue to meet this condition\nfor a time following death (Mackie 1997). On this view, if you and I\nare animals (as animalists say), then we could survive for a time\nafter we are dead, albeit as corpses. In fact, we could survive\nindefinitely, by arranging to have our corpses preserved.\n\nHowever, this way of defending the anti-terminators\u2019s view may\nnot be decisive. The terms \u2018dead animal\u2019 and \u2018dead\nperson\u2019 seem ambiguous. Normally, when we use \u2018dead\npeople\u2019 or \u2018dead animal\u2019 we mean to speak of persons\nor animals who lived in the past. One dead person I can name is\nSocrates; he is now a \u2018dead person\u2019 even though his corpse\nsurely has ceased to exist. However, in certain contexts, such as when\nwe are standing inside morgues, we seem to use the terms \u2018dead\nanimal\u2019 and \u2018dead person\u2019 to mean \u201cremains of\nsomething that was an animal\u201d or \u201cremains of something\nthat was a person.\u201d On this interpretation, even in morgues\ncalling something a dead person does not imply that it is a\nperson.\n\nStill, the dispute between terminators and anti-terminators is\nunlikely to be settled on the basis of how we use terms such as\n\u2018dead animal\u2019 and \u2018dead person.\u2019 Metaphysical\nconsiderations must weigh in. For example, consider that the remarks\nmade in Section 1.3 about the persistence of objects are consistent\nwith the possibility that objects that are people may continue their\nexistence as corpses, which may be useful to anti-terminators. On the\nother hand, many theorists think that nothing is a person unless it\nhas various psychological features, which corpses lack, and some think\nthat nothing is an organism unless it is alive. Terminators may be\nable to exploit these thoughts.\n\nWhat about the second question: can creatures cease to exist without\ndying? Certainly things that never were alive, such as bubbles and\nstatues, can be deathlessly annihilated. Arguably, there are also ways\nthat living creatures can be deathlessly annihilated (Rosenberg 1983,\nFeldman 1992, Gilmore 2013). Perhaps an amoeba\u2019s existence ends\nwhen it splits, replacing itself with two amoebas, and the existence\nof chlamydomonas ends when pairs of them fuse to form a zygote. Yet\nwhen amoebas split, and chlamydomonas fuse, vital activities do not\ncease. If people could divide like amoebas, perhaps they, too could\ncease to exist without dying. (For a famous discussion of division,\nfusion, and their implications, see Parfit 1981.) If such\n\u2018deathless exits\u2019 are possible, we would have to modify\nthe loss of life account of death.\n\nHowever, proponents of the loss of life account can hold their ground.\nThey can say that division, fusion, and other apparent examples of\ndeathless exits are unusual ways of dying, because, in such cases,\nnonexistence is not brought about via the destruction of vital\nactivities, but they are not ways of escaping death altogether.\nProponents of the loss of life account might also turn the tables on\nits critics, and argue as follows: nothing can be alive unless it\nexists, so if something ceases to exist it ceases to be alive, but to\ncease to be alive is to die. So there are no deathless exits.\n",
