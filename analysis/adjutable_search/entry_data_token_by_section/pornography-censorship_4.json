    "main_text": "Feminist Approaches || Feminist Arguments against Pornography\n4.1 Feminist Arguments against Pornography\n\nAccording to anti-pornography feminists, pornography is not harmless\nentertainment or cathartic, therapeutic fantasy. Nor is the harm it\ncauses merely that of \u201coffense.\u201d Unlike moral\nconservatives, who object to pornography on the grounds of the\nobscenity of its sexually explicit content and its corrosive effect on\nthe conservative way of life, the primary focus of the feminist\nobjection to pornography is on the central role that pornography is\nthought to play in the exploitation and oppression of women\n(Lederer 1980; Itzin 1992; MacKinnon 1984, 1987, 1995; McGowan 2019;\nWatson 2018).\n\nThis concern is reflected in the distinctive way anti-pornography\nfeminists tend to define \u201cpornography.\u201d As we have seen,\nconservatives typically define \u201cpornography\u201d as including\nall sexually explicit material. This definition reflects the fact that\nconservatives object to pornography\u2019s sexual explicitness, which is\nobscene or appeals to \u201cprurient interests.\u201d\nAnti-pornography feminists, however, do not object to pornography\u2019s\nsexually explicit content per se. They typically draw a more\nfine-grained distinction within the class of sexually explicit\nmaterials between \u201cpornography,\u201d on the one hand, and\n\u201cerotica,\u201d on the other. \u201cErotica\u201d is generally\ndefined as sexually explicit material premised on equality, which\ndepicts women as genuinely equal and consenting participants in sexual\nencounters. \u201cPornography,\u201d in contrast, is typically\ndefined as that subset of sexually explicit material that depicts women\nbeing coerced, abused, dominated or degraded in such a way as to\nendorse their subordination. Unlike conservatives,\nanti-pornography feminists have no objection to material which is\nmerely sexually explicit, i.e., erotica, for sexually explicit material\nof this sort does not harm women. The objection is to\npornography \u2013 that subset of sexually explicit material that\nsubordinates women.\n\nIn 1983, two of the most prominent anti-pornography feminists in the\nUnited States, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, drafted an\nanti-pornography ordinance at the behest of the Minneapolis Council. A\nsimilar ordinance was passed by the Indianapolis City Council in 1984,\nbut later overturned on appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds\nthat the ordinance violated pornographers\u2019 First Amendment right\nto freedom of speech. Importantly, the ordinance did not seek to impose\ncriminal prohibitions or sanctions on pornography: It did not seek to\nmake the production, sale or consumption of pornography a criminal\noffence, punishable by imprisonment (as, for example, producing,\nselling or consuming heroin is a criminal offence). MacKinnon and\nDworkin thought that criminalizing the production, publication or\nconsumption of pornography would be counterproductive, serving to drive\nthe industry underground, thereby only further obscuring the harm it\ncauses to women. Rather, the ordinance sought civil remedies\nthat would enable women who are harmed in the making of pornography, or\nas a result of its consumption, to sue for a future ban on sexually\nexplicit material demonstrated to be harmful and to collect damages\nfrom pornographers for provable harm done by that material. There is\nsome argument about whether the proposed legislation would have\namounted to censorship, strictly speaking, since it did not seek to\nplace a prior ban on the publication of pornographic materials. But\ninsofar as the legislation allowed for courts to award and enforce\ninjunctions against publication of material demonstrated to be harmful,\nmany think that the legislation may have been functionally equivalent\nto censorship in practice (assuming that courts would in fact have been\nwilling to award and enforce injunctions).\n\nThe ordinance has been the subject of a heated debate among\nfeminists, many of whom are dubious both about the centrality of\npornography\u2019s role in the subordination of women and about the\ndesirability of employing strategies of legal regulation in the pursuit\nof feminist goals (e.g., Hunter and Law 1985; Lacey 1998, 71\u201397;\nCornell 2000; Strossen 1995). But the ordinance was significant, not\nleast for reconceptualizing the question of pornography in the public\narena in feminist terms: not as an issue about obscenity or public\nindecency, as it had hitherto tended to be viewed in legal and\npolitical contexts under the influence of moral conservatives, but as\nan issue about the civil rights of women. It also provided an\ninfluential definition of pornography that has featured prominently in\nmany subsequent discussions. The ordinance defined\n\u201cpornography\u201d as a civil rights violation, as a\nsystematic practice of sexual discrimination that violates\nwomen\u2019s right to equality:\n\n\nWe define pornography as the graphic sexually explicit subordination\nof women through pictures and words that also includes (i) women are\npresented dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; or\n(ii) women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or\npain; or (iii) women are presented as sexual objects experiencing\nsexual pleasure in rape, incest or other sexual assault; or (iv) women\nare presented as sexual objects tied up, cut up or mutilated or bruised\nor physically hurt; or (v) women are presented in postures or positions\nof sexual submission, servility, or display; or (vi) women\u2019s body parts\n\u2014 including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks\n\u2014 are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or\n(vii) women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals; or\n(viii) women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation,\ninjury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, or\nhurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual (MacKinnon\n1987,176).\n\nDworkin and MacKinnon allow that sexually explicit material that\ntreats men, children or transsexuals in sexually dehumanizing or\nsubordinating ways also counts as pornography.\n\nThe Dworkin-MacKinnon definition has two parts or stages. The first\npart of the definition defines \u201cpornography\u201d broadly in\nterms of a certain functional role or, as MacKinnon puts it, in terms\nof \u201cwhat it does\u201d: \u201cPornography\u201d is that\nsexually explicit material, whatever it is, that subordinates\nwomen.[4]\nThe second part of the definition, the\ncontent list (i)-(viii), goes on to list of the sorts of sexually\nexplicit material that MacKinnon and Dworkin think in fact\nfunctions to subordinate women, as revealed by the testimonial,\nexperimental, social and clinical evidence. The content list aims to be\nsufficiently precise so as to minimize the likelihood of legislation\nagainst pornography, so defined, threatening other forms of\nspeech \u2013 although many \u201canti-censorship\u201d feminists, along\nwith traditional liberal defenders of pornography, are not convinced\nthat it succeeds (Hunter and Law 1985; R. Dworkin 1993).\n\nI draw attention to the two-stages of the definition to reinforce a\npoint made in section 1: that one might agree with Dworkin and\nMacKinnon that pornography, defined purely functionally or conceptually\nas sexually explicit material that subordinates women, would be a bad\nthing, and yet disagree that the material with the features that they\ngo on to list in fact does this. (This might help to defuse some of the\nfrequently acrimonious debate in feminist circles surrounding\nMacKinnon\u2019s now famous claim that one cannot genuinely be a feminist\nand be pro-, or at least fail to be anti-, pornography. Feminists are,\nof course, opposed to anything that subordinates or oppresses women.\nYet there is surely room for reasonable disagreement about what, if\nany, sexually explicit material does this, and whether pursuing legal\nregulation of it is a desirable feminist strategy.)\n\nThe harms that most concern anti-pornography feminists fall into two\nbroad categories: 1) coercion and exploitation of women actors in the\nproduction of pornography; and 2) indirect harms to women, both as\nindividuals and as a group, resulting from the consumption of\npornography.\n\nOne particularly graphic example of the first sort of harm is\ndocumented in the book Ordeal (Lovelace and McGrady\n1980) about Linda Marchiano, who starred as \u201cLinda\nLovelace\u201d in the famous pornographic film Deep Throat.\nIn Ordeal, Marchiano tells of how she was abducted,\nhypnotized, drugged, beaten and tortured in order to perform her\nstarring role. Marchiano was one of a number of women who testified\nabout their experience of the harm caused by pornography at the\nMinneapolis City Council hearings into pornography in 1983. (The\ntranscript of the hearings is published as Pornography and Sexual\nViolence: Evidence of the Links (see Minneapolis City Council,\n1988). Marchiano\u2019s case is a particularly horrifying and extreme\nexample of how women may be harmed in the making of pornography; and\nmuch of what was done to Marchiano (the abduction, the beatings and\nthe torture) are criminal offences in their own right.  Many, both\nliberals and feminists, think that since these physical assaults\nshould not be allowed, enduring pornographic representations of these\ncrimes that cause further harm to the victim\u2019s interests should not be\npermitted to be distributed or consumed either (MacKinnon 1987;\nWendell 1983).\n\nOf course, not all women who perform in pornography are literally\nphysically coerced as paradigm slaves are, and as Marchiano was.\nNonetheless, many anti-pornography feminists are concerned that there\nis an important sense in which the \u201cchoice\u201d to participate\nin the making of pornography may not be a genuinely free one for many\nof the women who perform in it, who often come from underprivileged\nsocio-economic backgrounds and who have few alternative options for\nmaking a living. Under these circumstances, there may be an important\nsense in which the choice to perform in pornography is coerced, insofar\nas the women would not have chosen to perform in pornography had other\nreasonable options been available to them. The pornography industry may\ntake unfair advantage of underprivileged women, preying on their\npsychic and economic vulnerability, to reap enormous profits at their\nexpense. MacKinnon puts the point graphically: Pornography is a public\ninstitution of sexual slavery, trafficking in vulnerable women and\nchildren, and profiting from their suffering and subjugation.\n\nSome of the women who perform in pornography vigorously reject the\nclaim that they are exploited. At least in their own case, they argue,\nthe decision to become a porn star was a genuinely autonomous one\n(Gruen and Panichas 1997). They regard the claim that they are victims\nof exploitation as offensively patronizing and paternalistic, implying\nthat pornography is not a worthwhile or valid career choice, and\nportraying the women who act in pornography as hapless dupes of\npatriarchy. In reality, female porn actors may be fully autonomous and\nintelligent citizens pursuing a perfectly valid and rewarding career of\ntheir own choosing. Banning pornography, they argue, would constitute\nunjustified, paternalistic interference with their right to pursue\ntheir career of choice (McElroy 1995). Of course, that the decision to\npursue a career in pornography is a free and fulfilling one for\nsome women does not show that it is necessarily a free and\nfulfilling choice for all or even most of the women who\nperform in pornography.\n\nEven if the pornography industry does exploit some of the women who\nperform in it, however, there is a question about whether this\njustifies disallowing it. As a number of feminists and liberals have\nnoted in reply, other industries (such as supermarkets or fast-food\nchains) may likewise take advantage of workers with few alternative\nopportunities. Should these too be banned on grounds of exploitation?\nSurely not, they think. The best solution to such exploitation is\narguably not to ban pornography (or fast-food chains). For this would\nonly further deprive those already deprived of one more option, and one\nthat they might prefer over others of the limited range available to\nthem. We may do better to focus our efforts on redressing the\nunderlying economic and material conditions of disadvantage that make\nexploitation possible, so that the choice to perform in pornography\nmight be made, if it is made, as a genuinely free one, under fuller\nconditions of equality (R. Dworkin 1993; Wendell, 1983).\n\nSecond, anti-pornography feminists point to a range of indirect\nharms to women that result from the consumption of pornography. (For a\nvariety of analyses here, see A. Dworkin 1981; MacKinnon 1987; Jeffreys\n1990; Kappeler 1986; Coward 1984; Smart 1989, Ch. 6; Itzin 1998.) These\nmay include, but are not limited to, pornography\u2019s role as a cause of\nviolent sexual crime. Some feminists in the U.K. have argued for\nanti-pornography legislation on the model of existing U.K. laws\npreventing racial incitement: Pornography is speech that incites sexual\nviolence, and prohibition of such speech as incites sexual violence is\njustified for the same reason as prohibitions against racially\nincendiary speech, namely, to protect the physical security and bodily\nintegrity of individuals (Itzin 1992).\n\nOther feminist arguments focus instead, or as well, on the broader\nrole pornographic representations may play in harming other of women\u2019s\nsignificant interests. Some have suggested that pornography can be\nviewed as a sort of false advertising about women and sexuality, or as\nbeing akin to libelous speech \u2013 speech that defames women as a group,\ncausing corresponding harm to their reputation, credibility,\nopportunities and income expectations. They argue that women as a group\nhave a right to (civil) legal protection from these harms and to claim\ncompensation for such harm as pornographic speech can be demonstrated\nto have produced (Longino 1980; Hill 1987; MacKinnon 1995, 3\u201328;\nfor criticism, see Soble 1985). This is a promising strategy for\nanti-pornography feminists, since liberals already generally accept\nthat individuals have a right to protection from libelous or defamatory\nspeech.\n\nOther feminist arguments focus on the related role pornography may\nplay in restricting women\u2019s autonomy by reproducing and reinforcing a\ndominant public perception of the nature of women and sexuality that\nprevents women from articulating and exploring their own conceptions of\nsexuality and of the good life (Easton 1994; Dyzenhaus 1992).\n\nYet another line of feminist argument draws on the work of the\nprominent liberal philosopher, John Rawls, to suggest that regulation\nof pornography is justified insofar as rational, self-interested\nindividuals in the original position would not agree to basic social\ninstitutions that \u201casymmetrically either forced or gave strong\nincentives to members of one sex to become sex objects for the\nother\u201d (Okin 1987, 68). Rae Langton (1990) also seeks to use\nliberals\u2019 own theoretical commitments to make a (liberal) case for the\nlegitimacy of censorship, though her chosen liberal is Ronald Dworkin.\nLangton seeks to turn the tables on Dworkin\u2019s argument in an ingenious\nway, arguing that a consistent application of Dworkin\u2019s own principles\nactually supports a policy that prohibits pornography, rather than the\npermissive policy he himself favours. Preferences to consume\npornography necessarily depend on external preferences about the\ninferior worth of women that violate women\u2019s right to moral\nindependence. Furthermore, positive arguments for prohibiting\npornography may aim at securing social equality for women. If this is\nthe goal, then, by Dworkin\u2019s own lights, pornographers would have no\nrights against a prohibitive policy.\n\nMany of these concerns figure in a somewhat new light in a\nsignificant, rights-based strand of feminist argument associated\noriginally with Catharine MacKinnon. This approach has subsequently\nbeen developed by scholars in several different ways (e.g., Bianchi\n2008; Langton 1993, McGowan 2019, Mikkola 2017, Watson 2018). On one\ndistinctive version of this approach, pornography does not merely\ncause sexual discrimination and others harms; its production\nand consumption constitutes an act of sexual discrimination\n(Langton 1993; McGowan 2019). Since this approach has provoked\nparticular interest and discussion among both liberals and feminists,\nand has come to constitute a dominant framework for much of the\ncontemporary debate between liberals and feminists over pornography, it\nis worth examining it in more detail. According to MacKinnon,\npornography harms women in a very special and serious way: by violating\ntheir civil rights (MacKinnon 1984, 1987, 1992). In\nparticular, pornography subordinates women or violates their right\nto equal civil status; and it silences them or violates their\ncivil right to freedom of speech.\n\nPornography subordinates women by sexualizing their\ninequality. Pornography both expresses the view that women exist\nprimarily as objects for men\u2019s sexual gratification \u2013 that they are\nmen\u2019s sexual slaves, and frequently their willing sexual slaves \u2013 and it\npropagates this view by conditioning consumers to regard women\u2019s\nsubordination as a sexy, natural and legitimate feature of normal\nheterosexual relations. Pornography \u201csexualizes rape, battery,\nsexual harassment, prostitution and child sexual abuse; it thereby\ncelebrates, promotes, authorizes and legitimizes them\u201d (MacKinnon\n1987, 171\u2013172). By authorizing and legitimating the subjection of\nwomen, pornography makes the very real harm of women\u2019s subordination\ninvisible as harm: Rape, harassment and other forms of oppression come\nto be seen simply as sex. \u201cThe harm of pornography, broadly\nspeaking, is the harm of the civil inequality of the sexes made\ninvisible as harm\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 178). The view of women and\nsexuality that pornography helps to form and perpetuate manifests\nitself not simply in crimes of sexual violence against women, but in\ndiscrimination against women more generally: in the legal system, in\npolitics and public debate, and in the workplace. Pornography\n\u201cinstitutionalizes the sexuality of male supremacy\u2026Men\ntreat women as who they see women as being. Pornography constructs who\nthat is\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 172). By conditioning consumers to view\nand treat women as their sexual subordinates, pornography undermines\nwomen\u2019s ability to participate as full and equal citizens in public, as\nwell as private, realms.\n\nOne significant dimension of this inequality is that women\u2019s speech,\nwhere it occurs, lacks the credibility, authority and influence of\nmen\u2019s. Women as a group are systematically and differentially\nsilenced, MacKinnon thinks; and pornography contributes to\nthis in at least three ways (MacKinnon 1987, 1995; for further\ndiscussion, see Caponetto 2021; Maitra 2009; McGowan 2017, 2019; West\n2021).\n\nFirst, pornography silences women by helping to shape and reinforce\na hostile and uncomprehending social environment which makes many women\nreluctant to speak at all. Thus, for example, rape, sexual harassment\nand other violent sexual crime is significantly underreported by\nwomen.\n\nSecond, pornography creates a social climate in which, even where\nwomen do speak, their opinions are frequently paid little serious\nattention \u2013 especially where what women say contradicts the picture of\nwomen contained in pornography. Thus, women who do report sexual crime\nare often disbelieved, ignored, ridiculed, or dismissed. In MacKinnon\u2019s\nwords, pornography \u201cstrips and devastates women of credibility,\nfrom our accounts of sexual assault to our everyday reality of sexual\nsubordination. We are stripped of authority and reduced and devalidated\nand silenced\u201d (MacKinnon 1992, 483\u2013484).\n\nThird, pornography may silence women by causing their speech to fail\nto be understood, or to be misunderstood. For example, pornography may\nhelp to form and reinforce the general view that women who utter\n\u201cno\u201d in sexual contexts frequently do not intend to refuse\na man\u2019s sexual advantages by so speaking, and indeed may often intend\nto further encourage them in order to heighten sexual excitement. In a\nsocial environment in which this expectation is prevalent, women may\nnot be able to successfully communicate the idea of refusal to others:\nAlthough they may utter the appropriate sounds (e.g.,\n\u201cno\u201d), those sounds may frequently fail to communicate the\nidea they were intended to express. Pornography may thus prevent women\nfrom communicating their ideas to others, not by preventing them from\nproducing or distributing sounds and scrawls, but by preventing those\nsounds and scrawls from securing \u201cuptake\u201d\n(\u201cillocutionary disablement\u201d) or being understood by\nhearers as expressing the idea they were intended to express (Langton\n1993; Hornsby 1995; Hornsby and Langton 1998; Maitra 2009; McGowan\n2003, 2019; McGowan, Adelman, Helmers, Stolzenberg, 2011; Mikkola 2011;\nWest 2003, 2021; for criticism, see Anthony 2011, 2017; De Gaynesford\n2010; Jacobsen 2001; Bird 2002; Bauer 2015). If pornography silences\nwomen in this way, there may be some reason to be skeptical that the\nsolution preferred by many liberals (and feminists) of countering the\nharms of pornography with more speech \u2013 protest, satire, education and\npublic debate \u2013 will be effective, for pornography may make the relevant\nspeech acts \u201cunspeakable\u201d for women.\n\nFor MacKinnon, then, a desire for pornography and sexual violence is\nnot an epiphenomenal symptom or side-effect of other material and\nsocial conditions that lie at the root of women\u2019s subordinate position\nin society, as some other feminists are inclined to think. Rather, it\nis a central cause of the subordinate position of women in society. So\nlong as there is pornography, MacKinnon thinks, women will remain\nsubordinate and silenced.\n\nOne novel and strategically ingenious feature of MacKinnon\u2019s\nargument against pornography (and one that has provoked much of the\nmore recent interest and debate) is her conceptualization of the harm\nof pornography as the violation of women\u2019s civil rights, of\nwhich sexual violence against women may be but one, albeit significant,\ndimension. The violation of civil rights is a harm that most liberals\nhave special reason for taking very seriously. While some liberals\nunderstand the notion of \u201charm\u201d to others very narrowly, as\nincluding only physical interference with a person\u2019s bodily integrity\n(e.g., murder, battery, torture, kidnap, rape and other such physical\nassaults), most liberals nowadays are inclined to accept a slightly\nbroader interpretation of the harm principle. On this broader,\ninterest- or rights-based interpretation of the harm principle, any\nspeech or conduct that willfully or negligently interferes with\nimportant interests or rights of others is harmful conduct. On\nthis interest-based interpretation of the harm principle, the state is\nentitled to pass laws against conduct that deliberately or negligently\ninterferes with the rights of others, just so long as the\nrights-violation is sufficiently serious and the harm cannot\neffectively be prevented by other, less costly means (for example,\nthrough public education or debate). Of course, how this version of the\nharm principle applies depends crucially on the nature and relative\nimportance of the rights that individuals have; and this is the subject\nof much ongoing debate.\n\nSome liberals have accepted that pornography may contribute to\nwomen\u2019s subordination: if not by directly causing crimes of sexual\nviolence, then at least by conditioning consumers to view women as sex\nobjects, rather than as autonomous individuals worthy of equal concern\nand respect. They grant that this may contribute to discrimination\nagainst women in society and that it may prevent women from having the\nsame social and political influence that men generally possess. But,\nthey argue, this harm is not sufficiently great to justify interfering\nwith pornographers\u2019 freedom of speech. The right to freedom of\nexpression is a more important right. So, if we have to choose between\nthe right to equality (of women) and the right to freedom of speech (of\npornographers), we must choose freedom of\n speech.[5]\nBut MacKinnon\u2019s\nargument, if successful, would turn the tables on these traditional\nliberal defenses of pornography: Pornography could no longer be\ndefended simply on the grounds of the primacy of the right to freedom\nof speech, for permitting pornography violates\nwomen\u2019s right to freedom of speech too. We now seem to have a\nconflict of rights: not simply between pornographers\u2019 right to freedom\nof speech and women\u2019s right to equal civil status, but within the right\nto freedom of expression itself between pornographers\u2019 right to freedom\nof speech and women\u2019s right to freedom of speech. Why should\npornographers\u2019 right to freedom of expression take precedence over\nwomen\u2019s? The next section turns to the debates surrounding this\nquestion.\n",
