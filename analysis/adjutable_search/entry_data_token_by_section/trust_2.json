    "main_text": "The Nature of Trust and Trustworthiness || Non-motives-based theories\n1.2 Non-motives-based theories\n\nA final category are theories that base trustworthiness neither on the\nkind of motivation a trustworthy person has nor on the mere\nwillingness of this person to do what they are relied on to do. These\nare non-motives-based and also non-risk-assessment theories. The\nconditions that give rise to trustworthiness according to them reside\nultimately in the stance the trustor takes toward the trustee or in\nwhat the trustor believes they ought to be able to expect from this\nperson (i.e., in normative expectations of them). These theories share\nwith motives-based theories the goal of describing how trust differs\nfrom mere reliance.\n\nAn example is Richard Holton\u2019s theory of trust (1994). Holton\nargues that trust is unique because of the stance the trustor takes\ntoward the trustee: the \u201cparticipant stance\u201d, which\ninvolves treating the trustee as a person\u2014someone who is\nresponsible for their actions\u2014rather than simply as an object\n(see also Strawson 1962 [1974]). In the case of trust specifically,\nthe stance entails a readiness to feel betrayal (Holton 1994: 4).\nHolton\u2019s claim is that this stance and this readiness are absent\nwhen we merely rely on someone or something.\n\nAlthough Holton\u2019s theory has garnered positive attention (e.g.,\nby Hieronymi 2008; McGeer 2008), some do find it dissatisfying. For\nexample, some argue that it does not obviously explain what would\njustify a reaction of betrayal, rather than mere disappointment, when\nsomeone fails to do what they are trusted to do (Jones 2004; Nickel\n2007). They could fail to do it just by accident, in which case\nfeelings of betrayal would be inappropriate (Jones 2004). Others\nassert, by contrast, that taking the participant stance toward\nsomeone\n\n\ndoes not always mean trusting that person: some interactions [of this\nsort] lie outside the realm of trust and distrust. (Hawley 2014:\n7)\n\n\nTo use an example from Hawley, my partner could come to rely on me to\nmake him dinner every night in a way that involves him taking the\nparticipant stance toward me. But he needn\u2019t trust me to make\nhim dinner and so needn\u2019t feel betrayed if I do not. He might\nknow that I am loath for him to trust me in this regard: \u201cto\nmake this [matter of making dinner] a matter of trust\u201d between\nus (Hawley 2014: 7).\n\nSome philosophers have expanded on Holton\u2019s theory in a way that\nmight deflect some criticism of it. Margaret Urban Walker emphasizes\nthat in taking a participant stance, we hold people responsible (2006:\n79). We expect them to act not simply as we assume they will,\nbut as they should. We have, in other words, normative rather\nthan merely predictive expectations of them. Call this a\n\u201cnormative-expectation\u201d theory, which again is an\nelaboration on the participant-stance theory. Endorsed by Walker and\nothers (e.g., Jones 2004 and 2012a; Frost-Arnold 2014), this view\nexplains the trust-reliance distinction in terms of the distinction\nbetween normative and predictive expectations. It also describes the\npotential for betrayal in terms of the failure to live up a normative\nexpectation.\n\nWalker\u2019s theory is non-motives-based because it doesn\u2019t\nspecify that trustworthy people must have a certain kind of motive for\nacting. She says that trustworthiness is compatible with having many\ndifferent kinds of motives, including, among others, goodwill,\n\u201cpride in one\u2019s role\u201d, \u201cfear of penalties for\npoor performance\u201d, and \u201can impersonal sense of\nobligation\u201d (2006: 77). What accounts for whether someone is\ntrustworthy in her view is whether they act as they should, not\nwhether they are motivated in a certain way. (By contrast,\nCogley\u2019s normative-expectation theory says that the trustworthy\nperson both will and ought to act with goodwill. His theory is\nmotives-based.)\n\nProminent in the literature is a kind of normative-expectation theory\ncalled a \u201ctrust- (or dependence-) responsive\u201d theory (see,\ne.g., Faulkner and Simpson 2017: 8; Faulkner 2011, 2017; Jones 2012a,\n2017, 2019; McGeer and Petit 2017). According to this view, being\ntrustworthy involves being appropriately responsive to the reason you\nhave to do X\u2014what you are being relied on (or\n\u201ccounted on\u201d; Jones 2012a) to do\u2014when it\u2019s\nclear that someone is in fact relying on you. The reason you have to\ndo X exists simply because someone is counting on you; other\nthings being equal, you should do it for this reason. Being\nappropriately responsive to it, moreover, just means that you find it\ncompelling (Jones 2012a: 70\u201371). The person trusting you expects\nyou to have this reaction; in other words, they have a normative\nexpectation that the \u201cmanifest fact of [their] reliance will\nweigh on you as a reason for choosing voluntarily to X\u201d\n(McGeer and Pettit 2017: 16). This expectation is missing in cases of\nmere reliance. When I merely rely on you, I do not expect my reliance\nto weigh on you as I do when I trust you.\n\nAlthough trust-responsive theories might seem motives-based, they are\nnot. One might think that to be trustworthy, they require that you to\nbe motivated by the fact that you are being counted on. Instead, they\ndemand only that you be appropriately responsive to the reason you\nhave to do what you are being depended on to do. As Jones explains,\nyou could be responsive in this way and act ultimately out of\ngoodwill, conscientiousness, love, duty, or the like (2012a: 66). The\nreaction I expect of you, as the trustor, is compatible with you\nacting on different kinds of motives, although to be clear, not just\nany motive will do (not like in Walker\u2019s theory); some motives are\nruled out, including indifference and ill will (Jones 2012a: 68).\nBeing indifferent or hateful towards me means that you are unlikely to\nview me counting on you as a reason to act. Hence, if I knew you were\nindifferent or hateful, I would not expect you to be trust\nresponsive.\n\nTrust-responsive theories are less restrictive than motives-based\ntheories when it comes to defining what motives people need to be\ntrustworthy. At the same time, they are more restrictive when it comes\nto stating whether, in order to be trustworthy or trusted, one must be\naware that one is being counted on. One couldn\u2019t be trust\nresponsive otherwise. In trusting you, I therefore must \u201cmake\nclear to you my assumption that you will prove reliable in doing\nX\u201d (McGeer and Pettit 2017: 16). I do not have to do\nthat by contrast if, in trusting you, I am relying on you instead to\nact with a motive like goodwill. Baier herself allows that trust can\nexist where the trustee is unaware of it (1986: 235; see also Hawley\n2014; Lahno 2020). For her, trust is ubiquitous (Jones 2017: 102) in\npart for this reason; we trust people in a myriad of different ways\nevery single day, often without them knowing it. If she\u2019s right\nabout this fact, then trust-responsive theories are incomplete.\n\nThese theories are also vulnerable to objections raised against\nnormative-expectation theories, because they are again a type of\nnormative-expectation theory. One such concern comes from Hawley. In\nwriting about both trust and distrust, she states that\n\n\nwe need a story about when trust, distrust or neither is objectively\nappropriate\u2014what is the worldly situation to which (dis)trust]\nis an appropriate response? When is it appropriate to have\n(dis)trust-related normative expectations of someone? (2014: 11)\n\n\nNormative-expectation theories tend not to provide an answer. And\ntrust-responsive theories suggest only that trust-related normative\nexpectations are appropriate when certain motives are absent (e.g.,\nill will), which may not to be enough.\n\nHawley responds to the above concern within her \u201ccommitment\naccount\u201d of trust (2014, 2019). This theory states that in\ntrusting others, we believe that they have a commitment to doing what\nwe are trusting them to do (2014: 10), a fact which explains why we\nexpect them to act this way, and also why we fail to do so in cases\nlike that of my partner relying on me to make dinner; he knows I have\nno commitment to making his dinner (or anyone else\u2019s)\nrepeatedly. For Hawley, the relevant commitments\n\n\ncan be implicit or explicit, weighty or trivial, conferred by roles\nand external circumstances, default or acquired, welcome or unwelcome.\n(2014: 11)\n\n\nThey also needn\u2019t actually motivate the trustworthy person. Her\ntheory is non-motives-based because it states that to\n\n\nbe trustworthy, in some specific respect, it is enough to behave in\naccordance with one\u2019s commitment, regardless of motive. (2014:\n16)\n\n\nSimilarly, to trust me to do something, it is enough to believe that\nI\n\n\nhave a commitment to do it, and that I will do it, without believing\nthat I will do it because of my commitment. (2014: 16; her\nemphasis)\n\n\nNotice that unlike trust-responsive theories, the commitment account\ndoes not require that the trustee be aware of the trust in order to be\ntrustworthy. This person simply needs to have a commitment and to act\naccordingly. They don\u2019t even need to be committed to the\ntrustor, but rather could be committed to anyone and one could trust\nthem to follow through on that commitment (Hawley 2014: 11). So,\nrelying on a promise your daughter\u2019s friend makes to\nher to take her home from the party would count as an instance of\ntrust (Hawley 2014: 11). In this way, the commitment account is less\nrestrictive than trust-responsive theories are. In being\nnon-motives-based, Hawley\u2019s theory is also less restrictive than\nany motives-based theory. Trust could truly be ubiquitous if\nshe\u2019s correct about the nature of it.\n\nLike the other theories considered here, however, the commitment\naccount is open to criticisms. One might ask whether Hawley gives a\nsatisfactory answer to the question that motivates her theory: when\ncan we reasonably have the normative expectations of someone that go\nalong with trusting them? Hawley\u2019s answer is, when this person\nhas the appropriate commitment, where \u201ccommitment\u201d is\nunderstood very broadly. Yet where the relevant commitment is implicit\nor unwelcome, it\u2019s unclear that we can predict much about the\ntrustee\u2019s behavior. In cases like these, the commitment theory\nmay have little to say about whether it is reasonable to trust.\n\nA further criticism comes from Andrew Kirton (2020) who claims that we\nsometimes trust people to act contrary to what they are committed to\ndoing. His central example involves a navy veteran, an enlisted man,\nwhose ship sunk at sea and who trusted those who rescued them (navy\nmen) to ignore a commitment they had to save the officers first,\nbecause the officers were relatively safe on lifeboats compared to the\nenlisted men who were struggling in the water. Instead the rescuers\nadhered to their military duty, and the enlisted man felt betrayed by\nthem for nearly letting him drown. Assuming it is compelling, this\nexample shows that trust and commitment can come apart and that\nHawley\u2019s theory is\n incomplete.[8]\n\nThe struggle to find a complete theory of trust has led some\nphilosophers to be pluralists about trust\u2014that is, to say,\n\u201cwe must recognise plural forms of trust\u201d (Simpson 2012:\n551) or accept that trust is not just one form of reliance, but many\nforms of it (see also Jacoby 2011; Scheman 2020; McLeod 2020). Readers\nmay be led to this conclusion from the rundown I\u2019ve given of the\nmany different theories of trust in philosophy and the objections that\nhave been raised to them. Rather than go in the direction of\npluralism, however, most philosophers continue to debate what unifies\nall trust such that it is different from mere reliance. They tend to\nbelieve that a unified and suitably developed motives-based theory or\nnon-motives-based theory can explain this difference, although there\nis little consensus about what this theory should be like.\n\nIn spite of there being little settled agreement in philosophy about\ntrust, there are thankfully things we can say for certain about it\nthat are relevant to deciding when it is warranted. The trustor must\nbe able to accept that by trusting, they are vulnerable usually to\nbetrayal. Also, the trustee must be competent and willing to do what\nthe trustor expects of them and may have to be willing because of\ncertain attitudes they have. Last, in paradigmatic cases of trust, the\ntrustor must be able to rely on the trustee to exhibit this competence\nand willingness.\n",
