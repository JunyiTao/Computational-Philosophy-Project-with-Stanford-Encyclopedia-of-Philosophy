    "main_text": "Epistemological and Metaphysical Issues || Representationalist Accounts\n4.6 Representationalist Accounts\n\nRepresentational theories of consciousness\n link phenomenal consciousness with the\nrepresentational content of mental states, subject to some further\nfunctional criteria.  \n\nFirst-order representationalist accounts hold that if a particular\nstate of the visual system of an organism represents some property of\nthe world in a way that is functionally appropriate (e.g., not\nconceptually mediated, and operating as part of a sensory system),\nthen the organism is phenomenally conscious of that\nproperty. First-order accounts are generally quite friendly to\nattributions of consciousness to animals, for it is relatively\nuncontroversial that animals have internal states that have the\nrequisite functional and representational properties (insofar as\nmental representation itself is uncontroversial, that is). Such a view\nunderlies Dretske\u2019s (1995) claim that phenomenal consciousness is\ninseparable from a creature\u2019s capacity to perceive and respond to\nfeatures of its environment, i.e., one of the uncontroversial senses\nof consciousness identified above. On Dretske\u2019s view, phenomenal\nconsciousness is therefore very widespread in the animal kingdom.\nLikewise, Tye (2000) argues, based upon his first-order\nrepresentational account of phenomenal consciousness, that it extends\neven to honeybees. \n Driven by a variety of allegedly counter-intuitive consequences of\nfirst-order theories of consciousness, including skepticism about the\nrange of organisms it spans, a number of philosophers have offered a\nvariety of higher-order accounts of phenomenal consciousness. Such\naccounts invoke mental states directed towards other mental states to\nexplain phenomenal consciousness.  Carruthers\u2019 \u201chigher order\nthought\u201d (HOT) theory is that a mental state is phenomenally\nconscious for a subject just in case it is available to be thought\nabout directly by that subject (Carruthers 1998a,b, 2000). The term\n\u201cavailable\u201d here makes this a\n\u201cdispositionalist\u201d account. The contrast is an\n\u201cactualist\u201d account, which requires the actual occurrence\nof the 2nd order thought for subject to be conscious in the relevant\nsense. According to Carruthers, such higher-order thoughts are not\npossible unless a creature has a \u201ctheory of mind\u201d to\nprovide it with the concepts necessary for thought about mental\nstates. Carruthers\u2019 view is of particular interest in the current\ncontext because he has used it explicitly to deny phenomenal\nconsciousness to (almost) all nonhuman animals. \n\nCarruthers argues, there is little, if any, scientific support for\ntheory of mind in nonhuman animals, even among the great apes \u2014\nwith the possible exception of chimpanzees \u2014 from which he\nconcludes that there is little support either for the view that any\nanimals possess phenomenological consciousness. Further evaluation of\nthis argument will be taken up further below, but it is worth noting\nhere that if (as experiments on the attribution of false beliefs\nsuggest) young children before the age of four years typically lack a\ntheory of mind, Carruthers\u2019 view entails that they are not sentient\neither \u2014 fear of needles notwithstanding! This is a bullet\nCarruthers bites, although for many it constitutes a reductio\nof his view (a response Carruthers would certainly regard as\nquestion-begging).\n\n\nIn contrast to Carruthers\u2019 higher-order thought account of\nsentience, other theorists such as Armstrong (1980), and Lycan (1996)\nhave preferred a higher-order experience account, where\nconsciousness is explained in terms of inner perception of mental\nstates, a view that can be traced back to Aristotle, and also to John\nLocke. Because such models do not require the ability to conceptualize\nmental states, proponents of higher-order experience theories have\nbeen slightly more inclined than higher-order theorists to allow that\nsuch abilities may be found in other \nanimals[6].\n Gennaro (2004) argues, however, that a higher order thought theory is\ncompatible with consciousness in nonhuman animals, arguing that\nCarruthers and others have overstated the requirements for the\nnecessary mental concepts and that reentrant pathways in animal brains\nprovide a structure in which higher- and lower-order representations\ncould actually be combined into a unified conscious state.\n",
