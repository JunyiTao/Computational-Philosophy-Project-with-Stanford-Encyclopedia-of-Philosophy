Introduction: philosophical questions about space and time\n\nIn the context of interpreting Kant\u2019s views concerning space and\ntime, a number of philosophical questions are relevant. Kant himself\nprovides a litany of these questions in his so-called Inaugural\nDissertation of 1770, a text in which he broke with his previous\nbroadly \u201cLeibnizian\u201d views from the pre-critical period\n(Hatfield 2006, 72\u20136). He writes:\n\nSpace is not something objective and real, nor a substance, nor an\naccident, nor a relation; instead, it is subjective and ideal, and\noriginates from the mind\u2019s nature in accord with a stable law as\na scheme, as it were, for coordinating everything sensed externally.\n(Ak 2: 403)\n\n\nIn this one pithy sentence, we find a list of many important early\nmodern questions concerning space. Is space \u201creal,\u201d or is\nit \u201cideal\u201d in some sense? Is it a substance in its own\nright, a property of some substance, or perhaps neither? Is it somehow\ndependent on the relations among objects, or independent of those\nrelations? What is the relationship between space and the mind? And\nfinally, how do these various issues intersect with one another?\n\nThe passage from the Inaugural Dissertation hints at five\ndistinct questions or issues concerning space and time. First, there\nis the question of the ontology of space and time considered within\nthe framework of what Kant would regard as the dogmatic metaphysics of\nthe seventeenth century. This framework might suggest that if space\nand time are to exist, or to characterize the physical world, they\nmust be considered either substances in their own right, or else\nproperties of some substance. Neither option seems particularly\nattractive. Space and time seem distinct from substances because they\nare causally inert, causally inaccessible\u2014their aspects or\nproperties cannot be altered by interacting with any other\nsubstance\u2014and imperceptible. Since they are often regarded as\ninfinite, moreover, some thinkers have doubted that they could be\nsubstances, as God is often thought of as the sole infinite substance\n(Descartes may have conceived of space as \u201cindefinite\u201d for\nthis reason). However, it is also difficult to think of space and time\nas properties of any substance, for then they would presumably be\ndependent on that substance for their existence. If we regard them as\ndependent on any contingent substance, it seems that we would be\ncommitted to the idea that space and time could fail to exist, or\ncould disappear, depending on the happenings of that contingent\nsubstance. One might think instead that space and time depend on the\none necessary substance, but this obviously raises a host of other\nissues. To think of space and time as properties of God is potentially\nto regard God as spatiotemporal, which is verboten from the\npoint of view of many seventeenth-century thinkers (Janiak 2008,\nchapter five).\n\nA second topic arises if we consider the ontology of space and time\nindependently from the substance-property metaphysical framework,\ne.g. by considering the relationship of space and time to\nphysical objects. Following Newton\u2019s discussion in the first\n(1687) edition of the Scholium following the Definitions in the\nPrincipia, the modern debate concerning space\u2019s\nontology has been centered on two overarching conceptions: absolutism\n(now sometimes called \u201csubstantivalism,\u201d although that\nlabel raises certain issues), the view that space and time exist\nindependently of all possible objects and object relations, or perhaps\nthe view that space-time points exist; and relationalism, the view\nthat space and time depend for their existence on possible objects and\nrelations, or perhaps the view that space-time points do not exist\n(DiSalle 2006; Messina 2018).\n\nLeaving aside questions about ontology, there is a distinct\u2014or\nat least potentially distinct\u2014issue regarding space and time:\nwhat is the origin of our representation of space and of time? This\nthird issue arises from the sense in the early modern period that our\nidea or representation of space and time must somehow be importantly\ndistinct from our idea or representation of ordinary physical objects.\nMany believed that space and time are causally inert and therefore\nimperceptible\u2014how then are we are able to represent space and\ntime at all? Few are willing to deny that we have a representation,\nnot merely of spatial and of temporal objects, but also of space and\ntime themselves, so there is a genuine puzzle lurking here.\n\nThe fourth topic follows on the heels of the third: what is the\ncontent of our idea or representation of space and time? From\nKant\u2019s point of view, the content of a representation might\nprovide us with a guide to its possible origin. Alternatively, we\nmight be able to consider the origin of a representation as providing\nus with a clue as to what its content might be. In the case of space,\nthere may be reason to think that the content of our representation\nmust somehow reflect what we know about space from Euclidean\ngeometry.\n\nThe fifth and potentially final topic is closely connected with the\nthird and fourth, and indeed, connects all four previous topics with\none another: what is the relationship between space and time, on the\none hand, and the human mind, on the other? This question obviously\ncries out for clarification. Part of what this question might mean can\nbe characterized by the third and fourth questions above: if we think\nof the mind as representing space and time in a certain way, then\nperhaps this is part of our understanding of the mind\u2019s\nrelationship with space and time themselves. But within the context of\nKant\u2019s work, there is, at least prima facie, another\nissue lurking here\u2014are space and time somehow dependent upon the\nmind for their existence? It may be that some kind of dependence is\nsuggested by the origin\u2014or by the content\u2014of our\nrepresentation of space and time (or perhaps by these two jointly).\nBut Kant also seems to think that a view recognizing the dependence of\nspace and time on the mind might offer advantages in addressing the\nontological problems mentioned above.\n\nEach of these five philosophical issues concerning space and time is\nrelevant for understanding Kant\u2019s views. As we will see below,\npart of the difficulty in interpreting Kant arises from the fact that\nhe evidently transforms various aspects of the early modern debates\nconcerning space and time through the perspective presented in the\nfirst Critique (Allison 2004, 120\u20131). Within the context of\nthe first issue raised above, the view that space and time are\nreal may mean that space and time are substances in their own\nright, rather than merely properties; yet within the context of the\nabsolutism-relationalism debate, if space and time are real,\nthey exist independently of all objects and relations. But Kant uses\nthe terms real and ideal to express views concerning\nthe relation between space and time and the mind, leaving aside any\nviews concerning objects and relations. This entry aims to clarify\nmatters by separating these various considerations.\n",
