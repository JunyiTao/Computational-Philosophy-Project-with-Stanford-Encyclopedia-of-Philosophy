    "main_text": "A Progressive Alternative: The Higher-Brain Approach || The Claim that the Definition of Death is a Moral Issue\n2.3 The Claim that the Definition of Death is a Moral Issue\n\nAnother prominent argumentative strategy in support of the\nhigher-brain approach contends that the definition of death is a\nmoral issue and that confronting it as such vindicates the\nhigher-brain approach (see, e.g., Veatch 1975, 1993; Gervais\n1986, ch. 6). In asking how to determine that a human has died,\naccording to this argument, what we are really asking is when we ought\nto discontinue certain activities such as life-support efforts and\ninitiate certain other activities such as organ donation, burial or\ncremation, grieving, change of a survivor's marital status, and\ntransfer of property. The question, in other words, is when\n\u201cdeath behaviors\u201d are appropriate. This, the argument\ncontinues, is a moral question, so an answer to this question should\nbe moral as well. Understood thus, the issue of defining human death\nis best addressed with the recognition that irreversible loss of the\ncapacity for consciousness marks the time at which it is appropriate\nto commence death behaviors.\n\nIs the definition of death really a moral issue? To say that someone\nhas died does seem tantamount to saying that certain behaviors are now\nappropriate while certain others are no longer appropriate. But it\nhardly follows that the assertion of death is itself a moral claim. An\nalternative hypothesis is that the sense of moral import derives from\nthe fact that certain moral premises\u2014for example, that we\nshouldn't bury or cremate prior to death\u2014are shared by virtually\neveryone. Moreover, the concept of death is (at least originally) at\nhome in biology, which offers many instances in which a determination\nof death\u2014say, of a gnat or a clover\u2014seems morally\nunimportant. Rather than asserting that death itself is a moral\nconcept, it might be more plausible to assert that death, a biological\nphenomenon, is generally assumed to be morally important\u2014at\nleast in the case of human beings\u2014given a relatively stable\nbackground of social institutions and attitudes about \u201cdeath\nbehaviors.\u201d Furthermore, due to the moral salience of human\ndeath, discussions about its determination are often prompted by a\nmoral or pragmatic agenda such as interest in organ transplantation or\nconcerns about expensive, futile treatment. But these observations do\nnot imply that death is itself a moral concept.\n\nEven if it were, it would hardly follow that the higher-brain standard\nis preferable to other standards. A person with relatively\nconservative instincts might hold that death behaviors are morally\nappropriate only when the whole-brain or cardiopulmonary standard has\nbeen met. We need to ask, therefore, what grounds exist for the\nclaim\u2014advanced by proponents of the higher-brain\nstandard\u2014that death behaviors are appropriate as soon as someone\nhas irreversibly lost the capacity for consciousness. Perhaps the best\npossible grounds are that irreversible loss of consciousness entails\nan existence lacking in value for the unconscious individual\nherself. It appears, then, that the strongest specification of\nthe present line of reasoning actually relies upon the next (and\nfinal) argumentative strategy to be considered\u2014and might, as we\nwill see, lead to the conclusion that we should permit individuals to\nselect among several standards of death.\n",
