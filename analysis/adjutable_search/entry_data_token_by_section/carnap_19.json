    "main_text": "Semantics and Modality || From Syntax to Semantics\n6.1 From Syntax to Semantics\n\nCarnap had moved to Prague in late 1931, where he became a full\nprofessor at the German University, and wrote both drafts of the\nLogical Syntax of Language. The published book had tried to\nfuse the three major ideas of 1931\u20132. First, in January 1931,\nhad come the rejection of Wittgenstein\u2019s picture theory of\nmeaning and its replacement by Hilbert\u2019s sharp distinction\nbetween a language (a calculus, a purely formal symbol system) and its\ninterpretation, with the requirement that a language be entirely\nspecified by explicit rules. Closely bound up with this was the second\nidea, the insistence on the \u201cformal mode of speech\u201d and\nthe avoidance of talk of meaning in the metalanguage. And third, late\nin 1932, had come the principle of tolerance: no language is\ndefinitive or \u201ccorrect\u201d, there is no logical\n\u201creality\u201d for a language to \u201ccorrespond to\u201d.\nBut within a year of the book\u2019s publication, the second idea had\nbeen dropped; Carnap incorporated Tarski\u2019s new semantical\naccounts of designation and truth, and extended his view of language\naccordingly. The first and third ideas, however, survived for the rest\nof Carnap\u2019s career. What did not survive was the overreaction\nagainst \u201cmeaning\u201d that accompanied the original insight of\nJanuary 1931\u2014the exclusive emphasis on the \u201cformal mode of\nspeech\u201d in meta-discourse. In distinguishing between a language\nand its interpretation, Carnap\u2019s first response had been to\nrestrict extra-linguistic interpretation to the object language (and\nthere to one particular\u2014physicalistic\u2014interpretation) and\ndispense with it entirely in the \u201celucidatory\u201d\nmetalanguage. But this restriction was loosened when Tarski convinced\nhim in 1935 that interpretation could be completely specified by\nexplicit rules governing satisfaction, designation, and truth.\n\nBy this time, the storm clouds gathering in Europe were obvious for\nall to see, and like many of the Vienna Circle, Carnap sought an\nappointment in North America. In 1936 he landed at the University of\nChicago, where he would stay for nearly twenty years, longer than he\nspent anywhere else. While he felt personally and intellectually\ncomfortable in the United States, his written prose was never as\nelegant or forceful in English as it had been in German, and his\npublications were mostly quite technical. The larger context of his\nphilosophy was of course unknown to most colleagues and students, and\nremained obscure to the larger public. This decontextualization of\nlogical empiricism was reinforced by political factors. As new\nimmigrants, Carnap and his Vienna Circle friends felt vulnerable in\nthe United States, and many of them, having previously supported\nsocialist causes in Europe, were kept under observation by the FBI,\nincluding Carnap himself (Reisch 2005). It was thus in their interest\nto play down the larger significance of their philosophical\npreoccupations, and to pose as narrow specialists in technical\nsubjects.\n\nCarnap\u2019s first major publication in English, soon after his\narrival in the United States, was \u201cTestability and\nMeaning\u201d (1936\u201337), discussed in\n sections 1.5\u20136\n above, the first in a series of attempts to explicate\n\u201cempirical content\u201d or \u201cempirical\nreducibility\u201d more loosely than the strict reducibility\nenvisaged in the Aufbau. By the late 1930s, Carnap was\nwilling to countenance a theoretical language whose primitive terms\nare not constructed bottom-up from observation sentences at all but\nentirely top-down, \u201cfloating in the air, so to speak\u201d so\nthat these basic theoretical terms can have \u201conly an\nindirect interpretation, which is incomplete in a certain\nsense\u201d (Carnap 1939: 65). With these steps, Carnap began his\nreturn to a consideration of the theoretical language, which he had\nleft behind during the Vienna years. But his main focus, after\n\u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d, was the semantic framework\nitself. In the slim volume on Foundations of Logic and\nMathematics for the Encyclopedia of Unified Science (1939), the\ntripartite classification of linguistic theory into syntax, semantics,\nand pragmatics was first laid out. A five-volume series of Studies\nin Semantics was projected, of which the first two volumes,\nIntroduction to Semantics and Formalization of Logic\nwere published in 1942\u20133. Carnap then pursued a long-standing\ninterest in modal logic and intensional languages, and published\n\u201cModalities and Quantification\u201d in 1946, Meaning and\nNecessity in 1947. More details on Carnap\u2019s work in\nsemantics can be found in the supplement\n Semantics.\n\nCarnap had embraced semantics in 1935 because Tarski had convinced him\nthat designation and truth could be described and discussed in an\nentirely schematic and objective way, free from any psychological,\nsubjective, or epistemological entanglements or commitments (Carnap\n1936). As we have seen, the return to a schematic form of\n\u201cmeaning\u201d led many to regard Logical Syntax as\noutdated. Carnap himself (e.g., 1942: \u00a739) was careful to deny\nthis, but probably didn\u2019t emphasize enough that the return of\n\u201cmeaning\u201d did not mean a return to an explanatory\nconception of meaning like Russell\u2019s multiple relation theory of\nbelief or Wittgenstein\u2019s picture theory. This abstract and\nschematic approach to meaning disturbed many empiricists, giving them\nthe impression that Carnap had no interest in what actually underlay\nmeaning, i.e., wherein the relation between predicate and property\n(cf. Wilson 1982) actually consists. As B. Russell (1940: 314)\ncomplained, for instance, Carnap ignored \u201ccertain prior\nquestions to be considered\u201d before \u201cthe relation of\nempirical knowledge to non-linguistic occurrences\u201d could be\n\u201cproperly understood\u201d. But these \u201cprior\nquestions\u201d were just the ones Carnap had put aside in 1931\n(Pincock 2007). In this respect there is a seamless continuity in\nCarnap\u2019s \u201cminimalism\u201d with respect to language; even\nwith the embrace of semantics in 1935, these questions remained\nabsent, and only began to make a rather shadowy reappearance with\nCarnap\u2019s (1939) addition of pragmatics (the study of\nlanguage in use) to his conception of language. Semantics abstracts\nfrom use and focuses only on the expressions themselves and their\ndesignata, while syntax abstracts from designata as well (1939:\n3\u20134; 1942: 9).\n\nIn Carnap\u2019s work after 1935, it is important to distinguish\nbetween two different parts of the semantic enterprise. On the one\nhand, there are the repeated attempts to pin down the inferential\nrelations between observation-statements and more general ones\nwithin the general framework of semantics. In this work,\nmeaning and reference are considered particularly as they concern the\nempirical content (or meaning) of general statements, whether\nempirical generalizations or theories of more universal scope. This\nincludes \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d (Carnap 1936\u201337),\nthe later work on the theoretical language (Carnap 1956a, 1959a), and\nmuch of the work on inductive logic (see\n section 8\n below). On the other hand, there is the construction of the semantic\nframework itself, its logical delineation and development; even if\nthis was in principle to serve the first purpose, it became in effect\na distinct project. This includes the Studies in Semantics,\nthe modal logic systems (Carnap 1946), and the later version of his\nlogic textbook, Einf\u00fchrung in die symbolische Logik\n(Carnap 1968b). We discuss this second component in\n section 6.2,\n immediately following, and the first component in\n section 8\n below.\n",
