    "main_text": "The Chinese Room\n7. Brief Notes on Intelligence\n\nThere are radically different views about the measurement of\nintelligence that have not been canvassed in this article. Our concern\nhas been to discuss Turing (1950) and its legacy. But, of course, a\nmore wide-ranging discussion would also consider, for example,\nresearch on the measurement of intelligence using the mathematical and\ncomputational resources of Algorithmic Information Theory, Kolmogorov\nComplexity Theory, Minimum Message Length (MML) Theory, and so forth.\n(For an introduction to this literature, see Hernandez-Orallo and Dowe\n(2010), and the list of references contained therein. For a more\ngeneral introduction to research into AI, see Marquis et al.\n(2020).)\n\nMore broadly, there are radically different views about our\nconcept--or concepts--of intelligence that have not been canvassed in\nthis article. There is a dispute, for example, about whether Turing is\nbest interpreted as working with a response-dependent concept of\nintelligence. (Pro: Proudfoot (2013) (2020); contra: Wheeler (2020).)\nRelatedly, there is a dispute about whether intelligence bears some\nkind of necessary relationship to symmetrical relations of recognition\nbetween agents, as suggested in Mallory (2020) There is also a\nbroader dispute about whether we should think that useful notions of\nintelligence are always domain specific, or whether we should rather\nsuppose that there is something important in the idea of general,\ndomain independent intelligence.\n\nAnd there are radically different views about the most likely paths to\nbuilding general intelligence (assuming that there is such a thing as\ngeneral intelligence). For example, Crosby (2020) suggests that the\nbest way forwards may be to try to make machines that can pass animal\ncognition tests, i.e. that can create predictive models of their\nenvironment from sensory input. (There are clear precusors to this\nline of thought in, for example, Brooks (1990).)\n",
