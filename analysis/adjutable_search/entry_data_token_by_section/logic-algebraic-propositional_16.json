When a logic is algebraizable and what does this mean?\n\nThe algebraizable logics are purported to be the logics with the\nstrongest possible link with their algebraic counterpart. This\nrequirement demands that the algebraic counterpart of the logic should\nbe an algebraic semantics but requires a more robust connection\nbetween the logic and the algebraic counterpart than that. This more\nrobust connection is present in the best behaved particular logics\nknown. The mathematically precise concept of algebraizable logic\ncharacterizes this type of link. Blok and Pigozzi introduced that\nfundamental concept in Blok & Pigozzi 1989 and its introduction\ncan be considered the starting point of the unification and growth of\nthe field of abstract algebraic logic in the 1980s. Blok and Pigozzi\ndefined the notion of algebraizable logic only for finitary logics.\nLater, Czelakowski and Herrmann generalized it to arbitrary logics and\nalso weakened some conditions in the definition. We present here the\ngeneralized concept.\n\nWe said in\n Section 7\n that, roughly speaking, a logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable when 1) it\nhas an algebraic semantics, i.e., a class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) and a\nset of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) such that \\(\\bK\\) is a \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic\nsemantics for \\(\\bL\\), 2) this fact can be proved by using the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method slightly generalized and, moreover, 3) \\(\\bK\n\\subseteq \\bAlg^*\\bL\\). The generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski\nmethod (as we described it in\n Section 7)\n consists in allowing in step (5) (as already done in the definition\nof algebraic semantics) a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one variable\ninstead of a single equation \\(\\delta(p) \\approx \\varepsilon(p)\\) and\nin allowing in a similar manner a set of formulas \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in\nat most two variables to play the role of the formula \\(p\n\\leftrightarrow q\\) in the definition of the congruence of a theory.\nThen, given a theory \\(T\\), the relation \\(\\theta(T)\\),\nwhich has to be the greatest congruence on the formula algebra\ncompatible with \\(T\\) (i.e., the Leibniz congruence of\n\\(T)\\), is defined by \n\n\\[\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\theta(T) \\txtiff \\Delta(p/\\phi , q/\\psi) \\subseteq T.\\]\n\n\nWe need some notational conventions before engaging in the precise\ndefinition of algebraizable logic. Given a set of equations\n\\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one variable and a formula \\(\\phi\\), let \\(\\iEq(\\phi)\\)\nbe the set of equations obtained by replacing in all the equations in\n\\(\\iEq\\) the variable \\(p\\) by \\(\\phi\\). If \\(\\Gamma\\)\nis a set of formulas, let \n\n\\[\\iEq(\\Gamma) := \\bigcup_{\\phi \\in \\Gamma}\\iEq(\\phi).\\]\n\n\nSimilarly, given a set of formulas in two variables \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\)\nand an equation \\(\\delta \\approx \\varepsilon\\), let \\(\\Delta(\\delta ,\n\\varepsilon)\\) denote the set of formulas obtained by replacing \\(p\\)\nby \\(\\delta\\) and \\(q\\) by\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) in all the formulas in \\(\\Delta\\). Moreover, if\n\\(\\iEq\\) is a set of equations, let \n\n\\[\\Delta(\\iEq) = \\bigcup_{\\delta \\approx \\varepsilon \\in \\iEq} \\Delta(\\delta , \\varepsilon).\\]\n\n\nGiven a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p, q)\\) in two variables, this set\ndefines on every algebra \\(\\bA\\) a binary relation, namely the set of\npairs \\(\\langle a, b\\rangle\\) of elements of \\(A\\) that\nsatisfy in \\(\\bA\\) all the equations in \\(\\iEq(p, q)\\). In standard\nmodel-theoretic notation, this set is the relation \n\n\\[\\{\\langle a, b \\rangle : a, b \\in A \\textrm{ and } \\bA \\vDash \\iEq(p, q)[a, b]\\}.\\]\n\n\nThe formal definition of algebraizable logic is as follows. A logic\n\\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if there is a class of algebras\n\\(\\bK\\), a set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one variable and a set of\nformulas \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in two variables such that\n\n\\(\\bK\\) is an \\(\\iEq\\)-algebraic semantics for\n\\(\\bL\\), namely\n\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) and\nevery valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv[\\Gamma]\n\\subseteq \\tEq(\\bA)\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in \\tEq(\\bA)\\).\n \nFor every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\), the relation defined by the\nset of equations in two variables \\(\\iEq(\\Delta(p, q))\\) is the\nidentity relation on \\(A\\).\n\n\nA class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) for which there are sets \\(\\iEq(p)\\) and\n\\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) with these two properties is said to be an\nequivalent algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). The set of\nformulas \\(\\Delta\\) is called a set of equivalence formulas\nand the set of equations \\(\\iEq\\) a set of defining\nequations.\n\nThe conditions of the definition imply:\n\n\\(p\\) is inter-derivable in \\(\\bL\\) with the set of formulas \\(\\Delta(\\iEq)\\), that is \\[\\Delta(\\iEq) \\vdash_{\\bL } p \\textrm{ and } p \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(\\iEq).\\]\nFor every \\(\\bL\\)-theory \\(T\\), the Leibniz congruence of \\(\\langle \\bFm_L, T\\rangle\\) is the relation defined by \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\), namely \\[\\langle \\phi , \\psi \\rangle \\in \\bOmega_{\\bFm }(T)\\txtiff\\Delta(p/\\phi , q/\\psi) \\subseteq T.\\]\nIf \\(\\Delta\\) and \\(\\Delta '\\) are two sets of\nequivalence formulas, \\(\\Delta \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta '\\) and \\(\\Delta '\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta\\). Similarly, if \\(\\iEq(p)\\) and \\(\\iEq'(p)\\) are\ntwo sets of defining equations, for every algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bK,\n\\iEq(\\bA) = \\iEq'(\\bA)\\).\nThe class of algebras \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) also satisfies\nconditions\n (1)\n and\n (2),\n and hence it is an equivalent algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\).\nMoreover, it is an SP-class and includes every other class of algebras\nthat is an equivalent algebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\). Accordingly, it\nis called the greatest equivalent algebraic semantics of\n\\(\\bL\\).\nFor every \\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg^*\\bL\\) there is exactly one\n\\(\\bL\\)-filter \\(F\\) such that the matrix \\(\\langle\n\\bA, F\\rangle\\) is reduced, and this filter is the set \\(\\iEq(\\bA)\\).\nOr, to put it in other terms, the class of reduced matrix models of\n\\(\\bL\\) is \\(\\{\\langle \\bA, \\iEq(\\bA) \\rangle : \\bA \\in\n\\bAlg^*\\bL\\}\\).\n\n\nBlok and Pigozzi\u2019s definition of algebraizable logic in Blok\n& Pigozzi 1989 was given only for finitary logics and, moreover,\nthey imposed that the sets of defining equations and of equivalence\nformulas should be finite. Today we say that an algebraizable logic is\nfinitely algebraizable if the sets of equivalence formulas\n\\(\\Delta\\) and of defining equations \\(\\iEq\\) can both be taken\nfinite. And we say that a logic is Blok-Pigozzi algebraizable\n(BP-algebraizable) if it is finitary and finitely algebraizable.\n\nIf \\(\\bL\\) is finitary and finitely algebraizable, then \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\)\nis not only an SP-class, but a quasivariety and it is the quasivariety\ngenerated by any class of algebras \\(\\bK\\) which is an equivalent\nalgebraic semantics for \\(\\bL\\).\n\nWe have just seen that in algebraizable logics the class of algebras\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) plays a prominent role. Moreover, in these logics the\nclasses of algebras obtained by the two ways of generalizing the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method coincide, that is, \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL = \\bAlg\\bL\\)\n\u2014this is due to the fact that for any algebraizable logic\n\\(\\bL\\), \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) is closed under subdirect products. Hence, for\nevery algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) its algebraic counterpart\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) is its greatest equivalent algebraic semantics, whatever\nperspective is taken on the generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski\nmethod.\n\nConditions\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n of the definition of algebraizable logic (instantiated to\n\\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\)) encode the fact that there is a very strong link\nbetween an algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) and its class of algebras\n\\(\\bAlg\\bL\\), so that this class of algebras reflects the metalogical\nproperties of \\(\\bL\\) by algebraic properties of \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and\nconversely.\n\nThe definition of algebraizable logic can be stated, equivalently, in terms of\ntranslations between the logic and an equational consequence relation\n\\(\\vDash_{\\bK}\\) associated with any equivalent algebraic semantics\n\\(\\bK\\) for it \u2014that turns to be the same relation no matter\nwhat equivalent algebraic semantics we choose.\n\nThe equational consequence \\(\\vDash_{\\bK}\\) of a class of algebras\n\\(\\bK\\) is defined as follows.\n\n\n\\(\\{\\phi_i \\approx \\psi_i: i \\in I\\} \\vDash_{\\bK } \\phi \\approx \\psi\n\\txtiff\\)for every \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) and every valuation \\(v\\)\non \\(\\bA\\), if \\(\\bv(\\phi_i) = \\bv(\\psi_i)\\), for all\n\\(i \\in I\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) = \\bv(\\psi)\\).\n\n\nThe translations needed are given by the set of defining equations and\nthe set of equivalence formulas. A set of equations \\(\\iEq(p)\\) in one\nvariable defines a translation from formulas to sets of\nequations: each formula is translated into the set of equations\n\\(\\iEq(\\phi).\\) Similarly, a set of formulas \\(\\Delta(p, q)\\) in two\nvariables defines a translation from equations to sets of\nformulas: each equation \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\) is translated into\nthe set of formulas \\(\\Delta(\\phi , \\psi)\\).\nCondition (1) in the definition of algebraizable logic can be reformulated as \\[\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff \\iEq(\\Gamma) \\vDash_{\\bK } \\iEq(\\phi)\\] and condition (2) as \\[p \\approx q \\vDash_{\\bK } \\iEq(\\Delta(p, q)) \\textrm{ and } \\iEq(\\Delta(p, q)) \\vDash_{\\bK } p \\approx q.\\]\n\nThese two conditions imply\n\n\\(\\{\\phi_i \\approx \\psi_i : i \\in I \\} \\vDash_{\\bK }\n\\phi \\approx \\psi \\txtiff \\Delta(\\{\\phi_i \\approx \\psi_i : i \\in I\\})\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(\\phi , \\psi)\\)\n\n\nand condition\n (3)\n above is \n\n\\[p \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Delta(\\iEq(p)) \\textrm{ and } \\Delta(\\iEq(p)) \\vdash_{\\bL } p.\\]\n\n\nThus, an algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) is faithfully interpreted in the\nequational logic of its equivalent algebraic semantics (condition\n (1))\n by means of the translation of formulas into sets of equations given\nby a set of defining equations, and the equational logic of its\nequivalent algebraic semantics is faithfully interpreted in the logic\n\\(\\bL\\) (condition\n (9))\n by means of the translation of equations into sets of formulas given\nby an equivalence set of formulas. Moreover, both translations are\ninverses of each other (conditions\n (2)\n and\n (3))\n modulo logical equivalence. In this way we see that the link between\n\\(\\bL\\) and its greatest equivalent algebraic semantics is very strong\nand that the properties of \\(\\bL\\) should translate into properties of\nthe associated equational consequence relation. The properties that\nthis relation actually has of course depend on the properties of the\nclass of algebras \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\).\n\nGiven an algebraic semantics \\((\\bK, \\iEq)\\) for a logic \\(\\bL\\), a\nway to stress the difference between it being merely an algebraic\nsemantics and being an algebraic semantics that makes \\(\\bL\\)\nalgebraizable is that the translation of formulas into equations given\nby the set of equations \\(\\iEq\\) is invertible in the sense that there\nis a translation, say \\(\\Delta\\), of equations into formulas given by\na set of formulas in two variables that satisfies condition\n (9)\n above, and such that \\(\\iEq\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) provide mutually\ninverses translations (i.e., conditions\n (2)\n and\n (3)\n hold).\n\nThe link between an algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) and its greatest\nequivalent algebraic semantics given by the set of defining equations\nand the set of equivalence formulas allows us to prove a series of\ngeneral theorems that relate the properties of \\(\\bL\\) with the\nproperties of \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\). These kinds of theorems are called\nfrequently bridge theorems. We will mention as a sample  three of\nthem.\n\nThe first concerns the deduction theorem. To prove a general theorem\nrelating the existence of a deduction theorem with an algebraic\nproperty requires first that a concept of deduction theorem applicable\nto any logic has to be defined. A logic \\(\\bL\\) has the\ndeduction-detachment property if there is a finite set of\nformulas \\(\\Sigma(p, q)\\) such that for every set of formulas\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and all formulas \\(\\phi , \\psi\\) \n\n\\[\\Gamma \\cup \\{\\phi \\} \\vdash_{\\bL } \\psi\\txtiff\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\Sigma(\\phi , \\psi).\\]\n\n\nNote that this is a generalization of the standard deduction theorem\n(the direction from left to right in the above expression) and Modus\nPonens (equivalent to the implication from right to left) that several\nlogics have for a connective \\(\\rightarrow\\). In those cases\n\\(\\Sigma(p, q) = \\{p \\rightarrow q\\}\\).\n\nTheorem 1.\n\nA finitary and finitely algebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) has the\ndeduction-detachment property if and only if the principal relative\ncongruences of the algebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) are equationally\ndefinable.\n\nThe second theorem refers to Craig interpolation. Several notions of\ninterpolation are applicable to arbitrary logics. We consider only one\nof them. A logic \\(\\bL\\) has the Craig interpolation property\nfor the consequence relation if whenever \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\) and the set of variables of \\(\\phi\\) has nonempty intersection with the set of variables of formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\), \nthere is a finite set of formulas \\(\\Gamma '\\) whose set of variables is included in the set of variables\nshared by \\(\\phi\\) and the formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\) such that \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\Gamma '\\) and \\(\\Gamma ' \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\).\n\nTheorem 2.\n\nLet \\(\\bL\\) be a finitary and finitely algebraizable logic with the\ndeduction-detachment property. Then \\(\\bL\\) has the Craig\ninterpolation property if and only if \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) has the\namalgamation property.\n\nFinally, the third theorem concerns the Beth definability property.\nThe interested reader can find the definition in Font, Jansana &\nPigozzi 2003.  In the general setting we are in, the property is too involved to state it here.\n\nTheorem 3.\n\nA finitary and finitely algebraizable logic has the Beth property if\nand only if all the epimorphisms of the category with objects the\nalgebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and morphisms the algebraic homomorphisms are\nsurjective homomorphisms.\n\nOther results relating properties of an algebraizable logic with a\nproperty of its natural class of algebras can be found in Raftery\n2011, 2013. They concern respectively a generalization of the property\nof having the deduction-detachment property and the property that\ngeneralize the inconsistency lemmas of classical and intuitionistic\nlogic. Also an abstract notion of having a theorem like\nGlivenko\u2019s theorem relating classical and intuitionistic logic\nhas been proposed and related to an algebraic property in the case of\nalgebraizable logics in Torrens 2008. More recently Raftery 2016\npresents bridge theorems related to admissible rules and to structural\ncompleteness and L\u00e1vi\u010dka et al. 2021 studies bridge theorems for\nthe property of the weak excluded middle.\n\nFor several classes of algebras that are the equivalent algebraic\nsemantics of some algebraizable logic it has been known for a long\ntime that for every algebra in the class there is an isomorphism\nbetween the lattice of congruences of the algebra and a lattice of\nsubsets of the algebra with important algebraic meaning. For example,\nin Boolean algebras and Heyting algebras these subsets are the lattice\nfilters and in modal algebras they are the lattice filters that are\nclosed under the operation that interprets \\(\\Box\\). In all those\ncases, the sets are exactly the \\(\\bL\\)-filters of the corresponding\nalgebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\).\n\nAlgebraizable logics can be characterized by the existence of this\nkind of isomorphism between congruences and logic filters on the\nalgebras of their algebraic counterpart. To spell out this\ncharacterization we need a couple of definitions. Let \\(\\bL\\) be a\nlogic. The Leibniz operator on an algebra \\(\\bA\\) (relative\nto \\(\\bL)\\) is the map from the \\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\) to the set\nof congruences of \\(\\bA\\) that sends every \\(\\bL\\)-filter \\(D\\)\nof \\(\\bA\\) to its Leibniz congruence \\(\\bOmega_{\\bA\n}(D)\\). We say that the Leibniz operator of a logic \\(\\bL\\)\ncommutes with the inverses of homomorphisms between algebras\nin a class \\(\\bK\\) if for every homomorphism \\(h\\) from\nan algebra \\(\\bA \\in \\bK\\) to an algebra \\(\\bB \\in \\bK\\) and every\n\\(\\bL\\)-filter \\(D\\) of \\(\\bB, h^{-1}[\\bOmega_{\\bB\n}(D)] = \\bOmega_{\\bA }(h^{-1}[D]\\)).\n\nTheorem 4.\n\nA logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if and only if for every algebra\n\\(\\bA \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\) the Leibniz operator commutes with the inverses\nof homomorphisms between algebras in \\(\\bAlg\\bL\\) and is an\nisomorphism between the set of all \\(\\bL\\)-filters of \\(\\bA\\), ordered\nby inclusion, and the set of congruences \\(\\theta\\) of \\(\\bA\\) such\nthat \\(\\bA/\\theta \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\), ordered also by inclusion.\n\nThe theorem provides a logical explanation of the known isomorphisms\nmentioned above and similar ones for other classes of algebras. For\nexample, the isomorphism between the congruences and the normal\nsubgroups of a group can be explained by the existence of an\nalgebraizable logic \\(\\bL\\) of which the class of groups is its\ngreatest equivalent algebraic semantics and the normal subgroups of a\ngroup are its \\(\\bL\\)-filters.\n\nA different but related characterization of algebraizable logics is\nthis:\n\nTheorem 5.\n\nA logic \\(\\bL\\) is algebraizable if and only if on the algebra of\nformulas \\(\\bFm_L\\), the map that sends every theory \\(T\\)\nto its Leibniz congruence commutes with the inverses\nof homomorphisms from \\(\\bFm_L\\) to \\(\\bFm_L\\) and it is an\nisomorphism between the set \\(\\tTH(\\bL)\\) of theories of \\(\\bL\\),\nordered by inclusion, and the set of congruences \\(\\theta\\) of\n\\(\\bFm_L\\) such that \\(\\bFm_L /\\theta \\in \\bAlg\\bL\\), also ordered by\ninclusion.\n",
