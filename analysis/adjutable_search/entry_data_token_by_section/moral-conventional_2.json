    "main_text": "Turiel\u2019s Project\n3. Turiel\u2019s Project\n\nElliot Turiel (1938\u2013) was a student of Lawrence Kohlberg\n(1927\u20131987), who was, in turn, influenced by the work of Jean\nPiaget (1896\u20131980). All three have done seminal work on moral\ndevelopment in children and adolescents, and all three share the view\nthat reasoning and reflection on one\u2019s own experience plays a\ncentral role in that process. This view, often called\n \u201cconstructivism\u201d,[5]\n is commonly contrasted with nativist accounts of moral development\nthat focus on the role of the child\u2019s innate endowment, and with\nsocial learning accounts that emphasize the process of acquiring moral\nprinciples from parents and other important people in the\nchild\u2019s environment (Killen & Smetana\n2015:\u00a0705\u2013709; Killen & Dahl 2018: 23\u201325).\n\nImportantly, Piaget and Kohlberg also shared the view that over the\ncourse of development, normative reasoning emerges in stages.\nAccording to both Piaget and Kohlberg, in the first stage of this\nprocess young children\u2019s view of morality is\n\u201cheteronomous\u201d\u2014it is a set of rules imposed and\nenforced by others\u2014and moral behavior is simply a matter of\ncomplying with rules set by adults. On Kohlberg\u2019s account,\nchildren from about two and a half years of age to about six judge\nthat certain behaviors are wrong because they know those behaviors are\nlikely to be punished, and their understanding of wrongness is, near\nenough, exhausted by the idea of punishment: wrong behavior is seen as\nsimply behavior that is typically punished. Later, as the child\nmatures, different normative rules come to be viewed in different\nways. As Turiel portrays it,\n\n\n[t]his theoretical perspective can be referred to as a\n\u201cdifferentiation\u201d model in that moral reasoning emerges\nthrough its differentiation from nonmoral processes: At lower\ndevelopmental levels convention and morality are presumed to be\nundifferentiated, while at higher levels the two are\ndifferentiated\u2026. (Turiel 1977:\n 78)[6]\n\n\nTuriel was skeptical of the differentiation model and the claim that\nthere is only one sort of normative cognition in young children. He\nwas convinced that moral cognition is distinct from cognition about\nsocial conventions, that the distinction is present quite early in\ndevelopment, and thus\n\n\nthat social convention and morality should not be treated as part of\nthe same conceptual and developmental package, but as distinct\ndomains. (Turiel 1977: 79)\n\n\nIn order to make the case for this claim, he had to show that children\nmake characteristically moral judgments about some transgressions, and\nthat their judgments about conventional transgressions were\nsystematically different. To do that, Turiel needed an empirical test\nthat would indicate whether a normative judgment made by an\nexperimental participant\u2014child or adult\u2014was a moral\njudgment or a judgment about a conventional matter. In constructing\nhis test, Turiel drew inspiration from the philosophical literature on\nthe definition of morality. He focused on several of the necessary\nconditions for moral judgments that philosophers had proposed and used\nthem to guide the construction of the test he needed.\n\nOne of these was universalizability. Though Hare had relied on a\nlinguistic account of universalizability, Turiel interpreted\nuniversalizability as a claim about how a specific moral judgment\nmight be generalized to situations involving other people, other\nplaces, and other times. \u201cMoral prescriptions\u201d, he tells\nus, \u201care universally applicable in that they apply to\neveryone in similar circumstances\u201d (Turiel 1983: 36; italics in\nthe original). So if a young participant in an experiment judges that\nit is wrong for a child in her own school to push someone off a swing,\nand if that judgment is a moral judgment, we would expect the\nparticipant to judge that it is wrong for a child who attends a\ndifferent school in another town or in another country to push someone\noff a swing in similar circumstances. We\u2019d also expect the\nparticipant to judge that the same action\u2014pushing a schoolmate\noff a swing\u2014would be wrong if it happened sometime in the past\nor if it were to happen sometime in the future in similar\ncircumstances.\n\nA second feature discussed in the philosophical literature that was\nadopted by Turiel was the \u201ccategoricalness\u201d of moral\njudgments. To motivate this feature of his test he quotes the\nphilosopher Alan Gewirth:\n\n\nJudgments of moral obligation are categorical in that what persons\nought to do sets requirements for them that they cannot rightly evade\nby consulting their own self-interested desires or variable opinions,\nideals, or institutional practices. (Gewirth 1978: 24, quoted in\nTuriel 1983: 35)\n\n\nSince institutional practices cannot alter moral obligations, we\nshould expect that if an experimental participant has judged that it\nis wrong to push someone off a schoolyard swing, and that judgment is\na moral judgment, then the participant would judge that it would be\nwrong in another school where there was no rule against pushing people\noff a swing, and it would be wrong even if the principal in her own\nschool said that there was no rule against it. In the jargon that has\ndeveloped in the literature growing out of Turiel\u2019s work, these\nquestions are said to probe for \u201cauthority independence\u201d.\nThe test that Turiel proposed to determine whether a judgment is a\nmoral judgment includes one or more questions assessing whether the\nparticipant takes her judgment to be universalizable and one or more\nquestions assessing whether she takes her judgment to be authority\nindependent. The examples used and the details of the questions asked\nvary with the age of the participant and the details of the\nparticipant\u2019s culture (Turiel 1989).\n\nBoth universalizability and categoricalness are\n\u201cformal\u201d\u2014they do not impose any constraints on the\ncontent of moral rules or moral judgments. But Turiel also held that\nthere are substantive features that moral judgments share. Moral\njudgments, he maintained, deal with issues linked to harm, justice or\nrights. Thus if an experimental participant has made a genuinely moral\njudgment and is asked to explain why the behavior in question is\nwrong, she will typically appeal to the harm that has been done, or to\ninjustice or the violation of someone\u2019s rights. Though Turiel\nfound inspiration for his focus on harm, justice, and rights in the\nphilosophical literature he\n favored,[7]\n his choice of these features was largely motivated by his\nconstructivist account of how children acquire moral beliefs. In\nsimple \u201cprototypical\u201d cases, he maintained, the child can\nsee that the behavior has harmful consequences, and that leads the\nchild to recognize that the behavior is wrong.\n\n\nChildren\u2019s moral judgments are \u2026 derived \u2026 from\nfeatures inherent to social relationships\u2014including experiences\ninvolving harm to persons, violations of rights, and conflicts of\ncompeting claims. (Turiel 1983: 3)\n\nIf, for example, one hits another, thereby causing physical harm, an\nindividual\u2019s perception of that event as a transgression stems\nfrom features intrinsic to the event (e.g., from a perception of the\nconsequences to the victim). (Turiel 1977: 80)\n\n\nSince the hypothesis that Turiel hoped to establish is that children\ndistinguish moral judgments from judgments about social convention, he\nalso needed an account of the distinctive features of judgments about\nsocial convention. Here too, he sought guidance in the philosophical\nliterature, though his palette was more limited. There are occasional\nreferences to Lewis\u2019s Convention, and to other authors,\nbut much of his discussion of convention relies on the work of his\nBerkeley colleague, John Searle (1969) (see, for example, Turiel 1983:\n37\u201338). Social conventions, on Turiel\u2019s account, are\ntypically local\u2014they differ in different places and at different\ntimes. So if a young participant judges that an action is wrong at her\nschool, and if she takes the action to be a transgression of a social\nconvention, then she will not insist that it would be wrong in other\nschools or at other times. Social conventions are also alterable,\nsince people or their leaders can decide to change them. Thus if a\nparticipant views a transgression to be a violation of a conventional\nrule, she will agree that it would not be wrong if an appropriate\nauthority were to change the rule. The function of social conventions,\naccording to Turiel, is to facilitate social coordination. So if asked\nwhy a transgression of a social convention is wrong, a participant\nwill typically focus on the factors that sustain social coordination\nand the consequences of disrupting it.\n\nWith these putative features of moral and conventional judgments in\nhand, Turiel proceeded to construct an empirical test to determine\nwhether an experimental participant\u2019s judgment about a\ntransgression is a moral judgment or a conventional\njudgment. The test begins with a brief vignette describing a\nhypothetical transgression. Since Turiel was interested in determining\nwhether young children could distinguish moral transgressions from\nconventional transgressions, the transgressions typically involve\nevents that would be familiar to kids. Participants are then asked a\nseries of questions aimed at determining whether they think the action\ndescribed is wrong, whether they think the wrongness of the action is\n\u201cauthority independent\u201d, and whether they would\nuniversalize the judgment, making the same judgment if the\ntransgression occurred at another place or time. These questions can\nbe asked in a variety of ways depending on the age of the participants\nand the goals of the study. In the jargon favored by Turiel and other\nsocial domain theorists, the responses to these questions are called\n\u201ccriterion judgments\u201d, and criterion judgments are crucial\nin determining whether the participant takes the transgression to be\nmoral or conventional. If the action is judged to be wrong, authority\nindependent, and generalizable, the participant is classified as\nhaving viewed the transgression as moral, while if it is judged to be\nwrong, authority dependent, and not generalizable, the participant is\nclassified as having taken the transgression to be conventional\n(Turiel 1983:\u00a052; Smetana\u00a01993:\u00a0115). Participants are\nalso asked to explain why the transgression is wrong, and responses\nare assessed to determine whether they invoke harm, justice or rights,\nor whether they invoke factors, like social coordination, tradition,\ncustom, appeal to authority, or the likelihood of punishment, that\nTuriel maintains are the sorts of justifications to be expected if\nparticipants view the transgression as conventional. Turiel calls\nthese responses \u201cjustification categories\u201d (Turiel 1983:\n52\u201353,\n 66\u201368).[8]\n\nFrom the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s, this experimental format was\nused in a large number of studies where the vignettes recounted events\nthat the experimenters took to be clear cases of moral transgressions\n(like unprovoked hitting, stealing, and destroying someone\nelse\u2019s property) or clear cases of conventional transgressions\n(like chewing gum in class, talking without raising one\u2019s hand,\nand calling the teacher by her first name), and the results,\noverwhelmingly, accord with Turiel\u2019s prediction. The\ntransgressions that the experimenters took to be moral were typically\njudged to be wrong, authority independent, and generalizable to other\nplaces and times, and judgments that the transgressions are wrong were\nusually justified by appeal to the harm the transgression had caused.\nThe transgressions that the experimenters took to be conventional were\ntypically judged to be wrong and authority dependent, they were not\ngeneralized to other times or places, and they were justified by\nappeal to social expectations, the need for social coordination, the\ncommands of people in authority, the threat of punishment, and similar\n factors.[9]\n Moreover, these distinctions emerged very early in development. By\ntheir fourth birthday, and often earlier, most children had\nsystematically different reactions to the sorts of transgressions that\nwere used. These results were an overwhelming victory for Turiel in\nhis disagreement with Kohlberg and Piaget. It is not the case\nthat young children think of all normative rules in the same way;\ntheir normative cognition is not \u201cundifferentiated\u201d.\nNormative cognition in young children is much more subtle, more\nvaried, and more complex than Kohlberg and Piaget had portrayed it.\nThis was a major achievement in the study of child development. But\nthe experimental results and the way they have been interpreted raise\na number of important philosophical and psychological questions.\nWe\u2019ll address these questions in the sections that follow.\n",
