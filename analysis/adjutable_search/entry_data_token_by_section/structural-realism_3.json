    "main_text": "Epistemic Structural Realism (ESR) || Kantian ESR\n3.1 Kantian ESR\n\nAs mentioned above, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s structuralism had a\nKantian flavour. In particular, he thought that the unobservable\nentities postulated by scientific theories were Kant\u2019s noumena\nor things in themselves. He revised Kant\u2019s view by arguing that\nthe latter can be known indirectly rather than not at all because it\nis possible to know the relations into which they enter.\nPoincar\u00e9 followed the upward path to structural realism,\nbeginning with the neo-Kantian goal of recovering the objective or\nintersubjective world from the subjective world of private sense\nimpressions:\n\n\nwhat we call objective reality is\u2026 what is common to many\nthinking beings and could be common to all; \u2026 the harmony of\nmathematical laws. (1905 [1907: 14])\n\n\nHowever, he also followed the downward path to structural realism\narguing that the history of science can be seen as cumulative at the\nlevel of relations rather than objects. For example, between\nCarnot\u2019s and Clausius\u2019 thermodynamics the ontology changes\nbut the Second Law of Thermodynamics is preserved. While Worrall never\ndirectly endorses the Kantian aspect of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nthought, Zahar\u2019s structural realism is explicitly a form of\nKantian transcendental idealism according to which science can never\ntell us more than the structure of the noumenal world; the nature of\nthe entities and properties of which it consists are epistemically\ninaccessible to us (as in\n (2)\n above). Ivanova 2013 considers how Perrin\u2019s experiments\nconverted Poincar\u00e9 to atomism despite his previous opposition\nto it, but did not lead him to abandon his neo-Kantianism. Michela\nMassimi (2011) develops a different neo-Kantian perspective on\nstructural realism.\n\nFrank Jackson (1998), Rae Langton (1998), and David Lewis (2009) also\nadvocate views similar to ESR. Jackson refers to \u201cKantian\nphysicalism\u201d (1998: 23\u201324), Langton to \u201cKantian\nHumility\u201d, and Lewis to \u201cRamseyan Humility\u201d. Peter\nUnger (1979) also argues that our knowledge of the world is purely\nstructural and that qualia are the non-structural components of\nreality. Jackson argues that science only reveals the\ncausal/relational properties of physical objects, and that\n\n\nwe know next to nothing about the intrinsic nature of the world. We\nknow only its causal cum relational nature. (1998: 24)\n\n\nLangton argues that science only reveals the extrinsic properties of\nphysical objects, and both then argue that their intrinsic natures,\nand hence the intrinsic nature of the world, are epistemically\ninaccessible. Jackson points out that this inference can be blocked if\nthe natures of objects and their intrinsic properties are identified\nwith their relational or extrinsic properties, but argues that this\nmakes a mystery of what it is that stands in the causal relations.\nLewis\u2019 structuralism is based on the centrality he gives to the\nRamsey sentence reconstruction of scientific theories that is the\nsubject of the next section.\n",
