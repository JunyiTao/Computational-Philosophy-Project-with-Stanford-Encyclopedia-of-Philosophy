    "main_text": "\n\nDeontic\n logic[1]\n is a branch of logic that has been the most concerned with the\ncontribution that the following sorts of notions make to what follows\nfrom what (or what supports what, more\n generally):[2]\n\npermissible (permitted)\nimpermissible (forbidden, prohibited)\nobligatory (duty, required)\nomissible (non-obligatory)\noptional\nnon-optional\nmust\nought\nsupererogatory (beyond the call)\nindifferent / significant\nthe least one can do\nbetter than / best / good / bad\nclaim / liberty / power / immunity\nresponsibility\nblame / praise\nagency / action\n \n\nConsider\n\n\nYou are obligated to return your friend\u2019s car by noon, and the\nleast you can do is return it on time with the same level of battery\ncharge it had when you borrowed it, but it is beyond the call to buy\nyour friend a dinner on top of that.\n\n\nVarious things seem to follow: It is impermissible to not return your\nfriends car by noon; it is obligatory to return your friends car, it\nis optional to return it with a full charge, and doing the least you\ncan do precludes buying dinner. For deontic logic, the aim is to\ndevelop accounts of the logical contribution made by the key concepts\nlisted\n above.[3]\n\nAs a branch of logic, deontic logic is of theoretical\ninterest for some of the same reasons that\n modal logic\n (the logic of necessity and possibility), is of theoretical interest.\nAlso, although we need to be cautious about making too easy a link\nbetween deontic logic and practicality, many of the notions listed\nabove are typically employed in attempting to regulate and\ncoordinate our\n lives.[4]\n For these reasons, deontic logics often directly involve topics of\nconsiderable practical significance such as morality, law, social and\nbusiness organizations (their norms, as well as their normative\nconstitution), and security systems. To that extent, studying the\nlogic of notions with such practical significance adds\npractical significance to deontic logic itself. However, in this entry\nwe will focus on deontic logic itself, rather than its applications\nand practical relevance.\n\nIn Section 1 of this entry, we note certain simple formal\nrelationships between the first six concepts in our initial list\nabove, following the many-centuries old tradition of comparing (and\ncontrasting) basic deontic notions (e.g., obligation, permission) with\nmodal notions (e.g., necessity and possibility). In Section 2, we turn\nto a benchmark system of symbolic deontic logic, one that quickly\nbecame a reference point. In Section 3, we examine a closely related\napproach that reframes deontic notions by \u201creducing\u201d them\nto pure modal notions coupled with a so-called \u201cdeontic\nconstant\u201d. In a sense, the approaches discussed in Sections 2\nand 3 might be said to stand in the shadow of modal logic. In Section\n4, we turn to developments in deontic logic that emerged in the\nattempt to grapple with conditionalized deontic claims, and here\ndeontic logic comes more fully into its own. In Sections 5 and 6 we\nturn to a variety of perceived inadequacies of the benchmark systems\nintroduced in Sections 1\u20134. Section 5 focuses primarily on arguing for\nand specifying expansions of the limited expressive resources in the\nbenchmark\n systems.[5]\n Finally, Section 6, rather than expanding on the benchmark\napproaches, instead raises fundamental shortcomings in their modelling\nof the ideas they purport to represent, thereby seeking to dismantle\nsome of the principles of the systems and/or construct new systems in\ntheir place.\n",
