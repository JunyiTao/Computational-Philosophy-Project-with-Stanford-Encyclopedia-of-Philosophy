    "main_text": "Transworld identity and the transitivity of identity || The \u2018Four Worlds Paradox\u2019\n5.3 The \u2018Four Worlds Paradox\u2019\n\nChandler\u2019s transitivity argument can be adapted to produce a\npuzzle that is like those discussed in Sections 4.1\u20134.2 above in\nthat it involves the danger of \u2018bare identities\u2019, a puzzle\nthat Salmon (1982) has called \u2018The Four Worlds Paradox\u2019.\nTo illustrate the puzzle: suppose that the actual world\n(w1) contains a bicycle, a, that is\n(actually) originally composed of A1 + B1 + C1, and suppose that there\nis a possible world, w5, containing a bicycle,\nb (not identical with a), that is originally\ncomposed (in w5) of A2 + B2 + C1 (where A1 \u2260 A2\nand B1 \u2260 B2). Then, it seems, the application of the tolerance\nprinciple to each of a and b may generate two\nfurther possible worlds, in one of which (w6)\nthere is a bicycle with the original composition A1 + B2 + C1 that is\nidentical with a, and in the other of which\n(w7) there is a bicycle with the original\ncomposition A1 + B2 + C1 that is identical with b. Since\nthere need apparently be no further difference between the intrinsic\nfeatures of w6 and w7 on which\nthis difference in identities could depend, we appear to have a case\nof bare identities. This \u2018Four Worlds Paradox\u2019 is like\nChandler\u2019s original transitivity puzzle in that it does not seem\nthat an appeal to individual essences could solve it without\nconflicting with the tolerance principle. If that is so, the proponent\nof transworld identity (as opposed to counterpart theory) appears to\nbe left with two options consistent with the transitivity of identity:\nthe denial of the tolerance principle, and the acceptance of bare\nidentities. (But cf. Dorr, Hawthorne, and Yli-Vakkuri 2021.) It may be\nargued, however, that the acceptance of bare identities can be made\nmore palatable in this case by the adoption of a non-transitive\naccessibility relation between possible worlds. (See Salmon 1982,\n230\u2013252; and, for discussion, Roca-Royes 2016. For a defence of\nthe employment of counterpart theory to solve the Four Worlds Paradox,\nsee Forbes 1985, Ch. 7. For discussion of a radical response that\nretains the tolerance principle and yet avoids bare identities, but\nonly at the cost of claiming that two bicycles could completely\ncoincide in one possible world, simultaneously sharing all their\nparts, see Roca-Royes 2016, discussing Williamson 1990. On the\nrelevance to the Four Worlds Paradox to Kripke\u2019s principle of\nthe necessity (essentiality) of origin for artefacts, see also\nRobertson 1998 and Hawthorne and Gendler 2000.)\n",
