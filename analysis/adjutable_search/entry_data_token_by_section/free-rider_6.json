    "main_text": "Democracy\n6. Free Riding and Morality\n\n\nThe fact that people do organize for collective purposes is often\ntaken to imply the normative goodness of what they seek. If the\nby-product theory is correct, however, this conclusion is called into\nquestion. For example, we might join a union merely to obtain insurance\nat the inexpensive group rate even though we vote against all its\nstrike proposals, would never join a picket line, and might even be\nhostile to the idea of unions. Or we might go to a political\ndemonstration for varied reasons other than agreement with the\nostensible object of the demonstration; for example pro-war proponents\nmight join in a peace march on a glorious day to hear performances by\noutstanding singers in a large public park\u2014something they might\nhappily have paid to do.\n\n\nIt is also widely held that there are circumstances in which free riding on the provision of a collective good is morally wrong, because unfair. The two most prominent attempts to describe the conditions under which this kind of wrongness occurs are H.L.A. Hart\u2019s principle of \u201cmutuality of restrictions\u201d:\nwhen a number of persons conduct any joint enterprise according to rules and thus restrict their liberty, those who have submitted to these restrictions when required have a right to a similar submission from those who have benefited by their submission. (Hart 1955, 185)\n\n\nand John Rawls\u2019s \u201cprinciple of fairness\u201d:\na person is required to do his part as defined by the rules of an institution when two conditions are met: first, the institution is just (or fair), that is, it satisfies the two principles of justice; and second, one has voluntarily accepted the benefits of the arrangement or taken advantage of the opportunities it offers to further one\u2019s interests. (Rawls [1971] 1999, 96)\n\n\nHart (1955, 185) calls his formulation a \u201cbare schematic outline\u201d of the obligation one owes to other cooperators; and subsequent discussion has focused on examining what is required in order to make this outline fully accurate. As it stands, Hart\u2019s principle invites the kinds of objections emphasized by Robert Nozick (1974, 90\u201395):  I am not morally required to pay for books that are thrown into my house with bills attached, or to take a day off work to entertain the neighbourhood over a public address system after my neighbours have taken it in turns to do so. Rawls\u2019s formulation, which restricts the obligation to cases in which a benefit has been voluntarily accepted, avoids these objections. However, some writers argue that this is too tight a restriction (Arneson 1982; Cullity 1995; Trifan 2000): they maintain that when others are cooperating to produce a good that is compulsory, in the sense that once it is produced one cannot avoid receiving it (without excessive cost), one can still have an obligation of fairness to share the costs of producing it. If that is true, it keeps open the prospect (embraced by Hart but not Rawls) that political obligations can be grounded in an anti-free riding principle (Klosko 1992, 2005; Wolff 1995). However, the project of grounding political obligations in this way faces several significant obstacles. These include the objections that the operation of the state does not qualify as the kind of cooperative scheme to which a principle of fair contribution properly applies; that some citizens are sufficiently self-reliant that they do not receive a net benefit from the state; that grounding an obligation of fairness to contribute towards the cost of producing a collective good falls short of justifying the use of coercion to compel the contribution; and that an obligation to contribute to the production of a collective good does not apply when the question of which goods a group should be producing is itself contested.\n\n\nOne commonly claimed obligation of political participation is an obligation to vote. Support for this is sometimes attempted by appealing to a loose generalization argument that asks, \u201cWhat if everybody failed to vote?\u201d or, in the language here, \u201cWhat if\neverybody chose to free ride on the voting of others?\u201d The\npractical answer to that question, of course, is that everybody does\nnot choose to free ride, only some do, and that it is exceedingly\nunlikely that everyone will choose to do so. But if I think almost no\none else will vote, I should probably conclude that it is therefore\nthen in my interest to vote (that day has yet to come). Perhaps there\nis some number of citizens, k, such that, if fewer than k citizens\nvote, democracy will fail. If so, half of all citizens seems likely to\nbe a number significantly greater than k. Local elections in the US\noften turn out far less than half the eligible citizens and\npresidential elections turn out a bit more than half. One may question\njust what kind of democracy the US has, but it seems in some\nsignificant ways to work.\n\n\nThe generalization argument here is a variant of the fallacy of\ncomposition and it is logically specious in its presumed implication.\nYet many people assert such an argument in collective action contexts,\nand they may very well be motivated by the apparent moral authority of\nthe argument. An alternative question here would be something like:\n\u201cWhat if everybody failed to take into account the effect of\ntheir own vote on the election?\u201d The answer is that roughly half\nof Americans may well fail to take into account the effect of their own\nvotes on elections, and they vote. The rest ride free.\n",
