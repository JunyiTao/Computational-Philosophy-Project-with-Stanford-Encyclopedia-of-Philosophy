    "main_text": "Interdisciplinary Approaches || Indigenous Theory and Postcolonial Theory\n2.3 Indigenous Theory and Postcolonial Theory\n\nGaining a fuller analytic picture at the nexus of race and disability\ncalls for attention to indigenous persons. Literature on disabled\nindigenous experiences and related concepts is growing. For example,\nHuhana Hickey theorizes from the M\u0101ori perspective on the\npolitical and social circumstances of disabled indigenous persons\n(2001). Hickey demonstrates that, in addition to the fact that\nmultiply oppressed persons have difficulty getting their needs met\nthrough non-intersectional discourse and activism, M\u0101ori with\ndisabilities face additional barriers. Specifically, they experience\ninvalidation and minimization of their disabilities within M\u0101ori\ncommunities (2008: 1). Multiple factors create this situation,\nincluding the diversity of cultures within M\u0101ori communities,\nsome of which do not have words and concepts for disability identity\n(2008: 3). Economic oppression among M\u0101ori disproportionately\naffects disabled persons, influencing political and social access.\nYet, without the language to describe these issues, their lack of\naccess is not addressed (2008: 3\u20134). Further, some M\u0101ori\nattribute disability to spiritual or social causes, which leads to\nexclusion (2008: 3). Significantly, Hickey also cites the\npost-colonial status of M\u0101ori communities as a factor that\nfurther complicates questions of religion and contributes to the\nexclusion of disabled M\u0101ori (2008: 4\u20135). Rejecting both the\nmedical and social models of disability, Hickey advocates for a\ncommunities-based model that supports access and human rights (2006).\nShe seeks disability support options for Maori in her research\n(2004).\n\nMeanwhile, Lavonna Lovern theorizes indigenous disability from a\nNative American perspective, considering difference and inclusion\nwithin Native American communities in North America (2008, 2017). She\nargues that theorists and activists must address differences between\nthe dominant culture and Native American cultures; otherwise a choice\nto identify as disabled may further oppress those within Native\nAmerican cultures. Addressing differences includes paying critical\nattention to the ontology and epistemology in Native American\ncommunities when theorizing about indigenous disability or working in\nsolidarity with those communities (2008). Western conceptions of body\nand mind are different from Native American conceptions, and the\nhistory of colonization has made these differences especially complex\nto disentangle. Disability dialogues on a global scale would benefit\nfrom the engagement of indigenous voices, and the situation of\ndisabled indigenous persons would improve with their inclusion (2017).\nWith Carol Locust, Lovern explores the necessary translation work\namong cultures to work toward greater understanding, explicating\nNative American conceptions of difference (Lovern & Locust 2013).\nIn another significant example, Devi Mucina writes from the indigenous\nUbuntu perspective of South Africa; his work engages disability,\nincluding developmental disability, storytelling, and Blackness (e.g.,\n2010).\n\nPostcolonial theorists working in critical disability theory deal with\ncolonization and neo-colonization, treating disability within that\ncontext. As we have already seen, indigenous disability scholars are\ndealing with the tangled impacts of colonization. Postcolonial\nscholars seek to decolonize disability by centering the global South,\nchallenging neo-colonialism in capitalism, culture, and discourse, and\nre-engaging questions of disability from a diversity of cultures (cf.\nMeekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 54). For instance, Shaun Grech\ndetails the export of Western disability studies, noting that this\nsilences the majority of disabled people who live in the global South.\nGrech uncovers and critiques the related ways that the projects of\nneoliberal development are enacted on this global South majority\n(2011). In another notable instance, Fiona Kumari Campbell engages an\nimplicit critique of Western disability studies in Contours of\nAbleism (2009). As Dan Goodley writes in the book\u2019s\nforeword, \u201cCampbell not only takes to task ableism, she grabs it\nkicking and screaming from its perch aboard the good ship Empire and\ntears it apart\u201d (2009: ix).\n",
