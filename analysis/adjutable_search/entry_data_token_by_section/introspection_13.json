    "main_text": "The Accuracy of Introspection || Empirical Evidence on the Accuracy of Introspection\n4.2 Empirical Evidence on the Accuracy of Introspection\n\nThe arguments of the previous section are a priori in at least the\nbroad sense of that term (the psychologists\u2019 sense): They depend\non general conceptual considerations and armchair folk psychology\nrather than on empirical research. To these might be added the\nargument, due to Boghossian (1989) that \u201cexternalism\u201d\nabout the content of our attitudes (the view that our attitudes depend\nconstitutively not just on what is going on internally but also on\nfacts about our environment; Putnam 1975; Burge 1979) seems to\nproblematize introspective self-knowledge of those attitudes. This\nissue will not be treated here, since it is amply covered in the\nentries on\n externalism about mental content\n and\n externalism and self-knowledge.\n\nNow we turn to empirical research on our self-knowledge of those\naspects of our minds often thought to be accessible to introspection.\nSince character traits are not generally regarded as introspectible\naspects of our mentality, we\u2019ll skip the large literature on the\naccuracy or inaccuracy of our judgments about them (e.g., Taylor and\nBrown 1988; Paulhus and John 1998; Funder 1999; Vazire 2010; see also\nHaybron\u2019s 2008 skeptical perspective on our knowledge of how\nhappy we are); nor will we discuss self-knowledge of subpersonal,\nnonconscious mental processes, such as the processes underlying visual\nrecognition of color and shape.\n\nAs a general matter, while a priori accounts of the epistemology of\nintrospection have tended to stress its privilege and accuracy,\nempirical accounts have tended to stress its failures.\n4.2.1 Of the Causes of Attitudes and Behavior\n\nPerhaps the most famous argument in the psychological literature on\nintrospection and self-knowledge is Nisbett and Wilson\u2019s\nargument that we have remarkably poor knowledge of the causes of, and\nprocesses underlying, our behavior and attitudes (Nisbett and Wilson\n1977; Nisbett and Ross 1980; Wilson 2002). Section 2.1 above briefly\nmentioned their emblematic finding that people in a shopping mall were\noften ignorant of a major factor\u2014position\u2014influencing\ntheir judgments about the quality of pairs of stockings. In Nisbett\nand Bellows (1977), also briefly mentioned above, participants were\nasked to assess the influence of various factors on their judgments\nabout features of a supposed job applicant. As in Nisbett and\nWilson\u2019s stocking study, participants denied the influence of\nsome factors that were in fact influential; for example, they denied\nthat the information that they would meet the applicant influenced\ntheir judgments about the applicant\u2019s flexibility. (It actually\nhad a major influence, as assessed by comparing the judgments of\nparticipants who were told and not told that they would meet the\napplicant.) Participants also attributed influence to factors that\nwere not in fact influential; for example, they falsely reported that\nthe information that the applicant accidentally knocked over a cup of\ncoffee during the interview influenced \u201chow sympathetic the\nperson seems\u201d to them. Nisbett and Bellows found that ordinary\nobservers\u2019 hypothetical ratings of the influence of the various\nfactors on the various judgments closely paralleled the\nparticipants\u2019 own ratings of the factors influencing\nthem\u2014a finding used by Nisbett to argue that people have no\nspecial access to causal influences on their judgments and instead\nrely on the same sorts of theoretical considerations outside observers\nrely on (the self/other parity view described in Section 2.1). Despite\nsome objections (such as White 1988), both psychologists and\nphilosophers now tend to accept Nisbett\u2019s and Wilson\u2019s\nview that there is at best only a modest first-person advantage in\nassessing the factors influencing our judgments and behavior.\n\nIn series of experiments, Gazzaniga (1995) presented commissurotomy\npatients (people with severed corpus callosum) with different visual\nstimuli to each hemisphere of the brain. With cross-hemispheric\ncommunication severely impaired due to the commissurotomy, the left\nhemisphere, controlling speech, had information about one part of the\nvisual stimulus, while the right hemisphere, controlling some aspects\nof movement (especially the left hand) had information about a\ndifferent part. Gazzaniga reported finding that when these\n\u201csplit brain\u201d patients were asked to explain why they did\nsomething, when that action was clearly caused by input to the right,\nnon-verbal hemisphere, the left hemisphere would sometimes fluently\nconfabulate an explanation. For example, Gazzaniga reports presenting\nan instruction like \u201claugh\u201d to the right hemisphere,\nmaking the patient laugh. When asked why he laughed, the patient would\nsay something like \u201cYou guys come up and test us every month.\nWhat a way to make a living!\u201d (1393). When a chicken claw was\nshown to the left hemisphere and snow scene to the right, and the\npatient was asked to select an appropriate picture from an array, the\nright hand would point to a chicken and the left hand to a snow\nshovel, and when asked why they selected those two things, the patient\nwould say something like \u201cOh, that\u2019s simple. The chicken\nclaw goes with the chicken and you need a shovel to clean out the\nchicken shed\u201d (ibid.). Similar confabulation about motives is\nsometimes (but not always) seen in people whose behavior is,\nunbeknownst to them, driven by post-hypnotic suggestion (Richet 1884;\nMoll 1889 [1911]), and in disorders such as hemineglect (anosognosia),\nblindness denial (Anton\u2019s syndrome), and Korsakoff\u2019s\nsyndrome (Hirstein 2005).\n\nIn a normal population, Johansson and collaborators (Johansson et al.\n2005; Johansson et al. 2006) manually displayed to participants pairs\nof pictures of women\u2019s faces. On each trial, the participant was\nto point to the face he found more attractive. The picture of that\nface was then centered before the participant while the other face was\nhidden. On some trials, participants were asked to explain the reasons\nfor their choices while continuing to look at the selected face. On a\nfew key trials, the experimenters used sleight-of-hand to present to\nthe participant the face that was not selected as though it\nhad been the face selected. Strikingly, the switch was noticed only\n28% of the time. What\u2019s more, when the change was not detected\nparticipants actually gave explanations for their choice that appealed\nto specific features of the unselected face that were not possessed by\nthe selected face 13% of the time. For example, one participant\nclaimed to have chosen the face before him \u201cbecause I love\nblondes\u201d when in fact he had chosen a dark-haired face\n(Johansson et al. 2006, 690). Johansson and colleagues failed to find\nany systematic differences in the explanations of choice between the\nmanipulated and non-manipulated trials, using a wide variety of\nmeasures. They found, for example, no difference in linguistic markers\nof confidence (including pauses in speech), emotionality, specificity\nof detail, complexity or length of description, or general position in\nsemantic space. These results, like Nisbett\u2019s and\nWilson\u2019s, suggest that at least some of the time when people\nthink they are explaining the bases of their decisions, they are\ninstead merely theorizing or confabulating.\n\nWegner has found that people can often be manipulated into believing\nthat they willed or intended behavior that is in fact caused by\nanother person\u2019s manipulation and, conversely, that they exerted\nno control over movements that were in fact their own\u2014as with\nOuija boards, with or without a cheating, intentionally directive\nconfederate (Wegner and Wheatley 1999; Wegner 2002). The literature on\n\u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d is replete with cases in which\nparticipants\u2019 attitudes appear to change for reasons they do, or\nwould, deny. According to cognitive dissonance theory, when people\nbehave or appear to behave counternormatively (e.g., incompetently,\nfoolishly, immorally), they will tend to adjust their attitudes so as\nto make the behavior seem less counternormative or\n\u201cdissonant\u201d (Festinger 1957; Aronson 1968; Cooper and\nFazio 1984; Stone and Cooper 2001). For example, people induced to\nfalsely describe as enjoyable a monotonous task they\u2019ve just\ncompleted will tend, later, to report having a more positive attitude\ntoward the task then those not induced to lie (though much less so if\nthey were handsomely paid to lie in which case the behavior is not\nclearly counternormative; Festinger and Carlsmith 1959; but see Bem\n1967, 1972 for an argument that the attitude doesn\u2019t change but\nonly the report of it). Presumably, if such attitude changes were\nknown to the person they would generally fail to have their\ndissonance-reducing effect. Research psychologists have also confirmed\nsuch familiar phenomena as \u201csour grapes\u201d (Elster\n1983/2016; Lyubomirsky and Ross 1999; Kay, Jiminez, and Jost 2002) and\n\u201cself-deception\u201d (Mele 2001) which presumably also involve\nignorance of the factors driving the relevant judgments and actions.\nAnd of course the Freudian psychoanalytic tradition has also long held\nthat people often have only poor knowledge of their motives and the\ninfluences on their attitudes (Wollheim 1981; Cavell 2006).\n\nIn light of this empirical research, no major philosopher now holds\n(perhaps no major philosopher ever held) that we have infallible,\nindubitable, incorrigible, or self-intimating knowledge of the causes\nof our judgments, decisions, and behavior. Perhaps weaker forms of\nprivilege also come under threat. But the question arises: Whatever\nfailures there may be in assessing the causes of our attitudes and\nbehavior, are those failures failures of introspection,\nproperly construed? Psychologists tend to cast these results as\nfailures of \u201cintrospection\u201d, but if it turns out that a\nvery different and more trustworthy process underwrites our knowledge\nof some other aspects of our minds\u2014such as what our present\nattitudes are (however caused) or our currently ongoing or recently\npast conscious experience\u2014then perhaps we can call only\nthat process introspection, thereby retaining some robust\nform of introspective privilege while acceding to the psychological\nconsensus regarding (what we would now call non-introspective)\nfirst-person knowledge of causes. Indeed, few contemporary\nphilosophical accounts of introspection or privileged self-knowledge\nhighlight, as the primary locus of privilege, the causes of our\nattitudes and behavior (though Bilgrami 2006 is a notable exception).\nThus, the literature reviewed in this section can be interpreted as\nsuggesting that the causes of our behavior are not, after all, the\nsorts of things to which we have introspective access.\n4.2.2 Of Attitudes\n\nResearch psychologists have generally not been as skeptical of our\nknowledge of our attitudes as they have been of our knowledge of the\ncauses of our attitudes (Section 4.2.1 above). In fact, many of the\nsame experiments that purport to show inaccurate knowledge of the\ncauses of our attitudes nonetheless rely unguardedly on self-report\nfor assessment of the attitudes themselves\u2014a feature of those\nexperiments criticized by Bem (1967). Attitudinal surveys in\npsychology and social science generally rely on participants\u2019\nself-report as the principal source of evidence about attitudes (de\nVaus 1985/2002; Sirken et al. (eds.) 1999). However, as in the case of\nmotives and causes, there\u2019s a long tradition in clinical\npsychology skeptical of our self-knowledge of our attitudes, giving a\nlarge role to \u201cunconscious\u201d motives and attitudes.\n\nA key challenge in assessing the accuracy of people\u2019s beliefs or\njudgments about their attitudes is the difficulty of accurately\nmeasuring attitudes independently of self-report. There is at present\nno tractable measure of attitude that is generally seen by\nphilosophers as overriding individuals\u2019 own reports about their\nattitudes. However, in the psychological literature,\n\u201cimplicit\u201d measures of attitudes\u2014measures of\nattitudes that do not reply on self-report\u2014have recently been\ngaining considerable attention (see Wittenbrink and Schwarz, eds.,\n2007; Petty, Fazio, and Bri\u00f1ol, eds., 2009). Such measures are\nsometimes thought capable of revealing unconscious attitudes or\nimplicit attitudes either unavailable to introspection or erroneously\nintrospected (Wilson, Lindsey, and Schooler 2000; Kihlstrom 2004; Lane\net al. 2007; though see Hahn et al. 2014).\n\nMuch of the leading research on implicit attitude measures has\nconcerned racism, in accord with the view that racist attitudes,\nthough common, are considered socially undesirable and therefore often\nnot self-ascribed even when present. For example, Campbell, Kruskal,\nand Wallace (1966) explored the use of seating distance as an index of\nracial attitudes, noting that racially Black and White students tended\nto aggregate in classroom seating arrangements. Using facial\nelectromyography (EMG), Vanman et al. (1997) found (racially) White\nparticipants to display facial responses indicative of negative affect\nmore frequently when asked to imagine co-operative activity with Black\nthan with White partners\u2014results interpreted as indicative of\nracist attitudes. Cunningham et al. (2004) showed White and Black\nfaces to White participants while participants were undergoing fMRI\nbrain imaging. They found less amygdala activation when participants\nlooked at faces from their own group than when participants looked at\nother faces; and since amygdala activation is generally associated\nwith negative emotion, they interpreted this tendency suggesting a\nnegative attitude toward outgroup members (see also Hart et al 1990;\nand for discussion Ito and Cacioppo 2007).\n\nMuch of the recent implicit attitude research has focused on response\npriming and interference in speeded tasks. In priming research, a\nstimulus (the \u201cprime\u201d) is briefly displayed, followed by a\nmask that hides it, and then a second stimulus (the\n\u201ctarget\u201d) is displayed. The participant\u2019s task is to\nrespond as swiftly as possible to the target, typically with a\nclassification judgment. In evaluative priming, for example,\nthe participant is primed with a positively or negatively valenced\nword or picture (e.g., snake), then asked to make a swift judgment\nabout whether the subsequently presented target word (e.g.,\n\u201cdisgusting\u201d) is good or bad, or has some other feature\n(e.g., belongs to a particular category). Generally, negative primes\nwill speed response for negative targets while delaying response for\npositive targets, and positive primes will do the reverse. Researchers\nhave found that photographs of Black faces, whether presented visibly\nor whether presented so quickly as to be subliminal, tend to\nfacilitate the categorization of negative targets and delay the\ncategorization of positive targets for White participants\u2014a\nresult widely interpreted as revealing racist attitudes (Fazio et al.\n1995; Dovidio et al. 1997; Wittenbrink, Judd, and Park 1997). In the\nImplicit Association Test, respondents are asked to respond\ndisjunctively to combined categories, giving for example one response\nif they see either a dark-skinned face or a positively valenced word\nand a different response if they see either a light-skinned face or a\nnegatively valenced word. As in evaluative priming tasks, White\nrespondents tend to respond more slowly when asked to pair\ndark-skinned faces with positively valenced words than with negatively\nvalenced words, which is interpreted as revealing a negative attitude\nor association (Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz 1998; Lane et al.\n2007). However, it should be noted that despite its prominence, the\nImplicit Association Task has recently been criticized as having poor\ntest-retest reliability and weak correlations with other measures of\nracism (Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard, and Tetlock 2013;\nGawronski, Morrison, Phills, and Galdi 2017; Payne, Vuletich, and\nLundberg 2017; Singal 2017).\n\nAs mentioned above, such implicit measures are often interpreted as\nrevealing attitudes to which people have poor or no introspective\naccess. The evidence that people lack introspective knowledge of such\nattitudes generally turns on the low correlations between such\nimplicit measures of racism and more explicit measures such as\nself-report\u2014though due to the recognized social undesirability\nof racial prejudice, it is difficult to disentangle\nself-presentational from self-knowledge factors in self-reports (Fazio\net al. 1995; Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz 1998; Wilson, Lindsey,\nand Schooler 2000; Greenwald and Nosek 2009). People who appear racist\nby implicit measures might disavow racism and inhibit racist patterns\nof response on explicit measures (such as when asked to rate the\nattractiveness of faces of different races) because they don\u2019t\nwant to be seen as racist\u2014a motivation that might drive\nthem whether or not they have accurate self-knowledge of their racist\nattitudes. Still, it seems prima facie plausible that people have at\nbest limited knowledge of the patterns of association that drive their\nresponses on priming and other implicit measures.\n\nBut what do such tests really measure? In philosophy, Zimmerman (2018)\nand Gendler (2008a, 2008b) have argued that measures like the Implicit\nAssociation Test do not measure actual racist beliefs but rather\nsomething else, something under less rational control (Gendler calls\nthem \u201caliefs\u201d). Schwitzgebel (2010) argues that people who\nare implicitly prejudiced but explicitly egalitarian are \u201cin\nbetween\u201d believing and failing to believe the egalitarian\npropositions that they sincerely accept (see also Levy 2015). Machery\n(2016) argues that implicit measures reveal multi-track dispositions,\nrather than attitudes. Gawronski and Bodenhausen (2006) advance a\nmodel according to which there is a substantial difference between\nimplicit attitudes, defined in terms of associative processes, and\nexplicit attitudes which have a propositional structure and are guided\nby standards of truth and consistency (see also Wilson, Lindsey, and\nSchooler 2000; Greenwald and Nosek 2009). Mandelbaum (2016) and\nBorgoni (2016) also endorse views on which people who are implicitly\nprejudiced but explicitly egalitarian have contradictory attitudes,\nthough they argue that both the implicit and the explicit attitudes\nare propositionally structured and to some extent subject to norms of\nrationality. Payne, Vuletich and Lundberg (2017) argue that implicit\nmeasures capture the situationally-variable accessibility of\nculturally given concepts.\n\nHow one answers this question about the relation between implicit bias\nand belief or other attitudes bears on the question of the accuracy of\nintrospection of the belief or other attitude in question. On the\nassumption that people are unaware of the extent of their bias, or at\nleast have no direct introspective access to their bias, that failure\nof introspection of bias constitutes a failure of introspection with\nrespect to the attitude in question. On the other hand, if what is at\nstake is merely an association or trait-like disposition, rather than\nan attitude, failure of introspectibility is unsurprising and does not\nbear on the general question of the introspection of attitudes.\n\nThe issue generalizes beyond implicit bias. To the extent attitudes\nare held to be reflected in, or even defined by, our explicit\njudgments about the matter in question and also, differently but\nperhaps not wholly separably (see Section 2.3.4 above), our explicit\njudgments about our attitudes toward the matter in question,\nour self-knowledge would seem to be correspondingly secure and\nimplicit measures beside the point. To the extent attitudes are held\nto crucially involve swift and automatic, or unreflective, patterns of\nreaction and association, our self-knowledge of them would appear to\nbe correspondingly problematic, corrigible by data from implicit\nmeasures (Bohner and Dickel 2011; Schwitzgebel 2011a,\nforthcoming).\n\nSimilarly, Carruthers (2011; see also Bem 1967, 1972; Rosenthal 2001;\nCassam 2014) argues that the evidence of Nisbett, Gazzaniga, Wegner,\nand others (reviewed in Section 4.2.1 above) shows that people\nconfabulate not just in reporting the causes of their\nattitudes but also in reporting the attitudes themselves. For example,\nCarruthers suggests that if someone in Nisbett and Wilson\u2019s\nfamous 1977 study confabulates \u201cI thought this pair was\nsoftest\u201d as an explanation of their choice of the rightmost pair\nof stockings, they err not only about the cause of their choice but\nalso in self-ascribing the judgment that the pair was softest. On this\nbasis, Carruthers adopts a self/other parity view (see Section 2.1\nabove) of our self-knowledge of our attitudes, holding that we can\nonly introspect, in the strict sense, conscious experiences like those\nthat arise in perception and imagery.\n4.2.3 Of Conscious Experience\n\nCurrently ongoing conscious experience\u2014or maybe immediately past\nconscious experience (if we hold that introspective judgment must\ntemporally follow the state or process introspected, or if emphasize\nthe concerns raised in Section 3.2 about the self-undermining of the\nintrospective process)\u2014is both the most universally acknowledged\ntarget of the introspective process and the target most commonly\nthought to be known with a high degree of privilege. Infallibility,\nindubitability, incorrigibility, and self-intimation claims (see\nSection 4.1.1) are most commonly made for self-knowledge of states\nsuch as being in pain or having a visual experience as of the color\nred, where these states are construed as qualitative states, or\nsubjective experiences, or aspects of our phenomenology or\nconsciousness. (All these terms are intended interchangeably to refer\nto what Block [1995], Chalmers [1996], and other contemporary\nphilosophers call \u201cphenomenal consciousness\u201d.) If\nattitudes are sometimes conscious, then we might also be capable of\nintrospecting those attitudes as part of our capacity to introspect\nconscious experience generally (Goldman 2006; Hill 2009).\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to study the accuracy of self-ascriptions of\nconscious experience for the same reasons it\u2019s difficult to\nstudy the accuracy of our self-ascriptions of attitudes (Section\n4.2.2): There\u2019s no widely accepted measure to trump or confirm\nself-report. In the medical literature on pain, for example, no\nbehavioral or physiological measure of pain is generally thought\ncapable of overriding self-report of current pain, despite the fact\nthat scaling issues remain a problem within and especially between\nsubjects (Williams, Davies, and Chadury 2000) as does retrospective\nassessment (Redelmeier and Kahneman 1996). When physiological markers\nof pain and self-report dissociate, it\u2019s by no means clear that\nthe physiological marker should be taken as the more accurate index\n(for methodological recommendations see Price and Aydede 2005).\nCorresponding remarks apply to the case of pleasure (Haybron\n2008).\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.3 above, early introspective psychologists\nboth asserted the difficulty of accurately introspecting conscious\nexperience and achieved only mixed success in their attempts to obtain\nscientifically replicable (and thus presumably accurate) data through\nthe use of trained introspectors. In some domains they achieved\nconsiderable success and replicability, such as in the construction of\nthe \u201ccolor solid\u201d (a representation of the three primary\ndimensions of variation in color experience: hue, saturation, and\nlightness or brightness), the mapping of the size of \u201cjust\nnoticeable differences\u201d between sensations and the\n\u201climinal\u201d threshold below which a stimulus is too faint to\nbe experienced, and the (at least roughly) logarithmic relationship\nbetween the intensity of a sensory stimulus and the intensity of the\nresulting experience (the \u201cWeber-Fechner law\u201d).\nContemporary psychophysics\u2014the study of the relation between\nphysical stimuli and the resulting sense experiences or\npercepts\u2014is rooted in these early introspective studies.\nHowever, other sorts of phenomena proved resistant to cross-laboratory\nintrospective consensus\u2014such as the possibility or not of\nimageless thought (see the entry on\n \u201cmental imagery\u201d),\n the structure of emotion, and the experiential aspects of of\nattention. Perhaps these facts about the range of early introspective\nagreement and apparently intractable disagreement cast light on the\nrange over which careful and well-trained introspection is and is not\nreliable.\n\nEricsson and Simon (1984/1993; Ericsson 2003) discuss and review\nrelationships between the participant\u2019s performance on various\nproblem-solving tasks, their concurrent verbalizations of conscious\nthoughts (\u201cthink aloud protocols\u201d), and their immediately\nretrospective verbalizations. The existence of good relationships in\nthe predicted directions in many problem-solving tasks lends empirical\nsupport to the view that people\u2019s reports about their stream of\nthoughts often accurately reflect those thoughts. For example,\nEricsson and Simon find that think-aloud and retrospective reports of\nthought processes correlate with predicted patterns of eye movement\nand response latency. Ericsson and Simon also cite studies like that\nof Hamilton and Sanford (1978), who asked participants to make yes or\nno judgments about whether pairs of letters were in alphabetical order\n(like MO) or not (like RP) and then to describe retrospectively their\nmethod for arriving at the judgments. When participants\nretrospectively reported knowing the answer\n\u201cautomatically\u201d without an intervening conscious process,\nreaction times were swift and did not depend on the distance between\nthe letters. When participants retrospectively reported \u201crunning\nthrough\u201d a sequential series of letters (such as\n\u201cLMNO\u201d when prompted with \u201cMO\u201d) reaction times\ncorrelated nicely with reported length of run-through. On the other\nhand, Flavell, Green, and Flavell (1995) report gross and widespread\nintrospective error about recently past and even current (conscious)\nthought in young children; and Smallwood and Schooler (2006) review\nliterature that suggests that people are not especially good at\ndetecting when their mind is wandering.\n\nIn the 20th century, philosophers arguing against infallibilism often\ndevised hypothetical examples in which they suggested it was plausible\nto attribute introspective error; but even if such examples succeed,\nthey are generally confined to far-fetched scenarios, pathological\ncases, or very minor or very brief mistakes (e.g., Armstrong 1963;\nChurchland 1988; Kornblith 1998, with an eye to the distinction\nbetween mistakes about current conscious experience and other sorts of\nmistakes). In the 21st century, philosophical critics of the accuracy\nof introspective judgments about consciousness shifted their focus to\ncases of widespread disagreement or (putative) error, either among\nordinary people or among research specialists. Dennett (1991),\nBlackmore (2002), and Schwitzgebel (2011b), for example, argue that\nmost people are badly mistaken about the nature of the experience of\nperipheral vision. These authors argue that people experience visual\nclarity only in a small and rapidly moving region of about 1\u20132\ndegrees of visual arc, contrary to the (they say) widespread\nimpression most people have that they experience a substantially\nbroader range of stable clarity in the visual field. Other recent\narguments against the accuracy of introspective judgments about\nconscious experience turn on citing the widespread disagreement about\nwhether there is a \u201cphenomenology of thinking\u201d beyond that\nof imagery and emotion, about whether sensory experience as a whole is\n\u201crich\u201d (including for example constant tactile experience\nof one\u2019s feet in one\u2019s shoes) or \u201cthin\u201d\n(limited mostly just to what is in attention at any one time), and\nabout the nature of visual imagery experience (Hurlburt and\nSchwitzgebel 2007; Bayne and Spener 2010; Schwitzgebel 2011b; though\nsee Hohwy 2011).\n\nIrvine (2013, forthcoming) has argued that the methodological problems\nin this area are so severe that the term \u201cconsciousness\u201d\nshould be eliminated from scientific discourse as impossible to\neffectively operationalize or measure. Feest (2014) and Timmermans and\nCleeremans (2015) similarly highlight the substantial methodological\nchallenges using introspective reports in the science of\nconsciousness, though without being quite as pessimistic as\nIrvine.",
