Consent in other domains\n\nFor decades, bioethicists have discussed medical informed consent in\nrelative isolation from consent in political philosophy, contract\ntheory, and sexual ethics, where notions of consent are also pivotal.\nThis is finally changing, and it raises new technical and\nphilosophical questions about how to put these different discourses in\ndialogue with each other. For instance, is what bioethicists call\n\u201cpresumed consent\u201d the same thing as what political\nphilosophers call \u201chypothetical consent\u201d? Is what\nbioethicists call \u201cproxy consent\u201d one with what lawyers\ncall \u201cimpersonal consent\u201d? What bioethicists dub\n\u201cinvalid consent\u201d would often be described by contract law\nexperts as \u201clack of consent\u201d (Beauchamp 2010, 56; Kleinig\n2010, 13, 15).\n\nThis new development also raises substantive normative questions. For\nexample, imagine that the same basic principle underlies legitimate\npolitical regimes and legitimate medical experimentation. It may\nfollow that either tacit consent to a political regime, which\n Lockean contract theorists\n often cite, cannot successfully legitimize political regimes; or that\ntacit consent successfully legitimizes medical experimentation,\nrendering long consent forms unnecessary. Likewise, imagine that the\nsame basic principle underlies the legitimate procurement of income\nand that of organs for transplantation. Then perhaps either income\ntax\u2014without tax-payers\u2019 consent\u2014is illegitimate\n(Nozick 1986), or a \u201ckidney tax\u201d could be perfectly\nlegitimate (Fabre 2008, chs. 4\u20135). Either way, existing practice\nin one of these domains would be misguided.\n\nOn a different approach, fundamentally different right-making\nprinciples and rationales regarding consent apply in domains like\nmedicine, sex, and the marketplace, as might be indicated by the\nvariety of approaches to consent between these domains. For example,\nin most commercial transactions, unlike in the medical sphere, there\nare no legal requirements to disclose all relevant information and to\nverify that it is understood (Miller and Wertheimer 2010, 80; Joffe\nand Truog 2010, 351), perhaps indicating that fairness matters there\nmore than autonomous decision-making. Likewise, whereas once we\nconsent to sell a car or to support a political candidate (by signing\na contract or casting a vote) our consent is not retractable, invasive\nmedical intervention is usually considered illegitimate once a\npreviously consenting patient or research participant expresses a\nchange of mind\u2014as though the point of consent in the medical\narena were not simply autonomous authorization but ongoing control\n(compare Pateman 1990, 79 on the wrongness of forcing sexual\ninteraction even within otherwise consensual marital relations).\nFinally, if A mishears B\u2019s consent to sex as refusal yet\nproceeds with sexual advances, a third party who understands the full\npicture has strong reasons to stop A\u2019s advances (pace\nAlexander 2014, 105). But if a physician mishears a patient\u2019s\nconsent to medically beneficial treatment as refusal yet proceeds to\nit, it is far less clear that a third party who understands the full\npicture should thwart the treatment. The point of medical care is,\nafter all, not defeated by discordance of attitudes in quite the same\nway that the point of sex is. One possible conclusion from this\nvariety is that the very point of requiring informed consent, and\nhence what is fundamentally required and when, vary between\ndomains.\n",
