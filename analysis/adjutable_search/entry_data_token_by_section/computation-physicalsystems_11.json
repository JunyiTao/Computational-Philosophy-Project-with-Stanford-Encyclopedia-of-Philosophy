    "main_text": "Is Every Physical System Computational? || The Universe as a Computing System\n3.4 The Universe as a Computing System\n\nSome authors argue that the physical universe is fundamentally\ncomputational. The universe itself is a computing system; therefore,\neverything in it is a computing system too (or a part thereof). Unlike\nthe previous versions of pancomputationalism, which originate in\nphilosophy, this ontic pancomputationalism originates in\nphysics. It includes both an empirical claim and a metaphysical one.\nAlthough the two claims are logically independent, supporters of ontic\npancomputationalism tend to make them both.\n\nThe empirical claim is that all fundamental physical magnitudes and\ntheir state transitions are such as to be exactly described by an\nappropriate computational formalism\u2014without resorting to the\napproximations that are a staple of standard computational modeling.\nThis claim takes different forms depending on which computational\nformalism is taken to describe the universe exactly. The two main\noptions are cellular automata, which are a classical computational\nformalism, and quantum computing, which is non-classical.\n\nThe earliest and best-known version of ontic pancomputationalism is\ndue to Konrad Zuse (1970, 1982) and Edward Fredkin, whose unpublished\nideas on the subject influenced a number of American physicists (e.g.,\nFeynman 1982, Toffoli 1982, Wolfram 2002; see also Wheeler 1982,\nFredkin 1990). According to some of these physicists, the universe\nliterally is a giant cellular automaton. A cellular automaton is a\nlattice of discrete cells; each cell can be in one of finitely many\nstates, and each cell updates its state in discrete steps depending on\nthe state of its neighboring cells. For the universe to be a cellular\nautomaton, all fundamental physical magnitudes must be discrete, i.e.,\nthey must take at most finitely many values. In addition, time and\nspace must be fundamentally discrete or must emerge from the discrete\nprocessing of the cellular automaton. At a fundamental level,\ncontinuity is not a real feature of the world\u2014there are no truly\nreal-valued physical quantities. This flies in the face of most\nmainstream physics, but it is not an obviously false hypothesis. The\nhypothesis is that at a sufficiently small scale, which is currently\nbeyond our observational and experimental reach, (apparent) continuity\ngives way to discreteness. Thus, all values of all fundamental\nvariables, and all state transitions, can be fully and exactly\ncaptured by the states and state transitions of a cellular\nautomaton.\n\nAlthough cellular automata have been shown to describe many aspects of\nfundamental physics, it is difficult to see how to simulate the\nquantum mechanical features of the universe using a classical\nformalism such as cellular automata (Feynman 1982). This concern\nmotivated the development of quantum computing formalisms (Deutsch\n1985, Nielsen and Chuang 2000). Instead of relying on\ndigits\u2014most commonly, binary digits or bits\u2014quantum\ncomputation relies on qudits\u2014most commonly, binary qudits or\nqubits. The main difference between a digit and a qudit is that\nwhereas a digit can take only one out of finitely many states, such as\n0 and 1 (in the case of a bit), a qudit can also take an uncountable\nnumber of states that are a superposition of the basis states in\nvarying degrees, such as superpositions of 0 and 1 (in the case of a\nqubit). Furthermore, unlike a collection of digits, a collection of\nqudits can exhibit quantum entanglement. According to the quantum\nversion of ontic pancomputationalism, the universe is not a classical\ncomputer but a quantum computer\u2014a computer that manipulates\nqubits (Lloyd 2006) or, more generally, qudits.\n\nThe quantum version of ontic pancomputationalism is less radical than\nthe classical version. The classical version eliminates continuity\nfrom the universe, primarily on the grounds that eliminating\ncontinuity allows classical computers to describe the universe exactly\nrather than approximately. Thus, the classical version appears to be\nmotivated not by empirical evidence but by epistemological concerns.\nAlthough there is no direct evidence for classical ontic\npancomputationalism, in principle it is a testable hypothesis (Fredkin\n1990). By contrast, quantum ontic pancomputationalism may be seen as a\nreformulation of quantum mechanics in the language of quantum\ncomputation and quantum information theory (qubits), without changes\nto the empirical content of the theory (e.g., Fuchs 2004, Bub\n2005).\n\nBut ontic pancomputationalists do not limit themselves to making\nempirical claims. They often make an additional metaphysical claim.\nThey claim that computation (or information, in the physical sense\ndescribed in Section 2.3) is what makes up the physical universe. This\npoint is sometimes made by saying that, at the most fundamental\nphysical level, there are brute differences between\nstates\u2014nothing more need or can be said about the nature of the\nstates. This view reverses the traditional conception of the relation\nbetween computation and the physical world.\n\nAccording to the traditional conception, which is presupposed by all\naccounts of computation discussed above, physical computation requires\na physical medium, or substrate. Computation is an aspect of the\norganization and behavior of a physical system; there is no software\nwithout hardware. Thus, according to the traditional conception, if\nthe universe is a cellular automaton, the ultimate constituents of the\nuniverse are the physical cells of the cellular automaton. It is\nlegitimate to ask what kind of physical entity such cells are and how\nthey interact with one another so as to satisfy their cellular\nautomata rules.\n\nBy contrast, according to the metaphysical claim of ontic\npancomputationalism, a physical system is just a system of\ncomputational states. Computation is ontologically prior to physical\nprocesses, as it were. \u201c\u2018Hardware\u2019 [is] made of\n\u2018software\u2019\u201d (Kantor 1982, 526, 534), or\n\u201cit\u201d (the physical) comes from \u201cbit\u201d (the\ncomputational) (Wheeler 1989). According to this non-traditional\nconception, if the universe is a cellular automaton, the cells of the\nautomaton are not concrete, physical structures that causally interact\nwith one another. Rather, they are software\u2014purely\n\u201ccomputational\u201d entities.\n\nSuch a metaphysical claim requires an account of what computation, or\nsoftware, or physical information, is. If computations are not\nconfigurations of physical entities, the most obvious alternative is\nthat computations are abstract, mathematical entities, like numbers\nand sets. As Wheeler (1982, 570) puts it, \u201cthe building element\n[of the universe] is the elementary \u2018yes, no\u2019 quantum\nphenomenon. It is an abstract entity. It is not localized in space and\ntime\u201d. Under this account of computation, the ontological claim\nof ontic pancomputationalism is a version of Pythagoreanism. All is\ncomputation in the same sense in which more traditional versions of\nPythagoreanism maintain that all is number or that all is sets (Quine\n1976).\n\nOntic pancomputationalism may be questioned on both the empirical and\nthe ontological fronts. On the empirical front, there is little\npositive evidence to support ontic pancomputationalism. Supporters\nappear to be motivated by the desire for exact computational models of\nthe world rather than empirical evidence that the models are correct.\nEven someone who shares this desire may well question why we should\nexpect nature to fulfill it. On the metaphysical front, Pythagoreanism\nfaces the objection that the abstract entities it puts at the\nfundamental physical level lack the causal and qualitative properties\nthat we observe in the physical world\u2014or at least, it is\ndifficult to understand how abstract entities could give rise to\nphysical qualities and their causal powers (e.g., Martin 1997).\n",
