    "main_text": "Ethics and Ethical Theory || From Metaphysics to Ethics\n3.2 From Metaphysics to Ethics\n\nAs Amod Lele has pointed out (Lele 2015,) there are at least four\nsignificant passages in the BCA in which \u015a\u0101ntideva\nattempts to draw normative conclusions from descriptive, philosophical\npremises: that is, to argue from an account of how things actually are\nto conclusions about how we should feel and how we should live. The\narguments identified by Lele are, first, that because our actions and\ndecisions arise from causes, we should practice patient endurance and\nabandon the irrational emotion of anger (BCA VI.22\u201349);\nsecond, that because there is no body over and above its parts, we\nshould abandon lust and change how we think about protecting the body\n(BCA VIII.40\u201383); third, that because there is no\nsubstantial self, we should care as much about others\u2019\nwell-being as we do about the things we ourselves value (BCA\nVIII.90\u2013109); and finally, that because everything is empty, we\nshould let go of all forms of attachment (various passages in\nBCA IX).\n\nThe first of these arguments is embedded in a passage now seen by many\nscholars as the most sophisticated and well-developed discussion in\nthe entirety of premodern Indian literature of what we know today as\nthe problem of free will. The three verses that are perhaps most\ncrucial to this passage are:\n\n\nVI.25. Whatever transgressions (apar\u0101dha) and vile\nactions (p\u0101pa) there are, all arise through the power of\nconditioning factors, while there is nothing that arises\nindependently.\n\nVI.31. In this way everything is dependent upon something else. Even\nthat thing upon which each is dependent is not independent. Since,\nlike a magical display, phenomena do not initiate activity, at what\ndoes one get angry like this?\n\nVI.33. Therefore, even if one sees a friend or an enemy behaving\nbadly, one can reflect that there are specific conditioning factors\nthat determine this, and thereby remain happy. (translation slightly\nmodified from C&S: 52\u201353)\n\n\nThough some main features of this argument are clear enough, there are\ndifferent ways to understand its conclusion. On one interpretation,\n\u015a\u0101ntideva thinks that anger is always cognitively\ninappropriate because he holds a version of what we call hard\ndeterminism or hard incompatibilism (a view defended in Goodman 2002\nand in ch. 8 of Goodman 2009). On this first reading,\n\u015a\u0101ntideva thinks that an accurate understanding of how our\nbehavior is caused excludes the possibility of basic desert, in which\nit would be morally fitting or appropriate to inflict hard treatment\non someone solely because of their past actions. The rejection of\nbasic desert, though, is still compatible with the idea that it could\nsometimes be appropriate to criticize or punish someone in order to\nbring about good consequences. (For a powerful and sophisticated\nexposition of this kind of perspective, see Pereboom 2001.)\n\nA second interpretation, advanced by Mark Siderits, attributes to\n\u015a\u0101ntideva a special form of compatibilism known as\n\u201cBuddhist paleocompatibilism\u201d (see, e.g., Siderits 2013).\nSiderits holds that the hard incompatibilist position is incorrect\nbecause it illegitimately moves back and forth between the\nconventional and ultimate levels of truth. Though there is no agency\nwhatsoever at the ultimate level, a kind of free will could still be\npossible in the context of conventional truth; and on this view,\nconventional free will could still justify many of our practices of\nassigning blame and responsibility.\n\nThe crux of the disagreement between the two interpretations concerns\nverse VI.32:\n\n\nIf it is argued that to resist anger is inappropriate, for \u201cwho\nis it that resists what?\u201d, our view is that it is appropriate:\nsince there is dependent origination there can be cessation of\nsuffering. (C&S: 53)\n\n\nOn the paleocompatibilist reading, \u015a\u0101ntideva in this verse\ntakes back important elements of the view that he appears to present\nin verses VI.22\u201331, shifting his position to retain elements of\nautonomous agency as part of the worldview of a practicing\nbodhisattva. On the hard incompatibilist reading, this verse responds\nto an objection against \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s position without\nabandoning or even qualifying the main argument. The claim that there\nis no autonomy of the type that would generate basic desert, it can be\nargued, is perfectly compatible with the claim that it would be better\nfor me to resist anger whenever it arises (see Goodman \n2016).\n\nAmong the numerous subsidiary arguments against the rationality of\nanger presented in BCA VI, one is especially noteworthy.\n\u015a\u0101ntideva holds that those who harm us are not autonomous,\nand so not responsible, because they are under control of irrational\nemotional reactions that overpower their ability to respond\nappropriately, and instead cause them to engage in actions destructive\nboth to others and to themselves. So the most appropriate response to\nothers\u2019 transgressions is not to get angry at them, but to\narouse the aspiration to develop in ourselves the ability to set\nothers free from emotional reactivity and confusion. This argument\nwould be quite influential among later Buddhists. Thus Tsong kha pa\nwrites that \n\n\nAlthough many reasonings are set forth in [the BCA], it is\neasy to be certain of this one, and it is a very powerful remedy for\nanger\u2026 so meditate repeatedly on this remedy. (GT:\n161\u201362) \n\n\nThe second argument from metaphysics to ethics discussed by Lele draws\non \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s arguments that are intended to refute\nthe real existence of the body. These are not offered merely to\nsatisfy some form of pure intellectual curiosity; they are intended to\nhave important motivational effects. Many people are proud of their\nbodies, and almost all adults have felt sexual attraction towards the\nbodies of some other people. Both the pride and the attraction,\n\u015a\u0101ntideva holds, can operate only when we ignore the\ninsubstantial nature and disgusting character of our own and\nothers\u2019 bodies (see, e.g., BCA VIII.30\u201370;\n\u015aS 231). Moreover, ordinary people understandably feel\nintensely protective of their own bodies, and this attitude often\nleads to morally questionable behavior. According to\n\u015a\u0101ntideva, if we clearly understand what the body is, we can\ntransform our emotional relationship with it. This transformation\ninvolves coming to see the body as \u201clike a machine, a mechanical\nconstruct of interconnected bones and muscles\u201d (\u015aS\n231, SS-G: 225). Though it has no intrinsic value at all, the body is\ninstrumentally useful as a means to support spiritual practice and to\nassist other sentient beings; as such, it makes sense to protect the\nbody as long as it can play a useful role. And when it can no longer\ndo so, it can still become food for carnivorous animals.\n\nConsiderable scholarly attention has recently focused on the third of\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s arguments, from the absence of any self to\nthe rationality of altruism. This argument was already explored in an\ninsightful way by Luis G\u00f3mez in 1973, and became a major topic\nof discussion largely as a result of the criticisms directed at it by\nPaul Williams (see Williams 1998, Siderits 2000, and Williams 2000).\nThe argument continues to attract both critics and defenders (see\nespecially ch. 4, 6, and 8 of Cowherds 2016). \n\nCommentators have tended to analyze the passage in question as having\ntwo major parts. The first part presents a simple, clear, inspiring,\nand yet at the same time, profoundly radical and unsettling argument\nfor altruism:\n\n\nVIII.94. I should dispel the suffering of others because it is\nsuffering like my own suffering. I should help others too because of\ntheir nature as beings, which is like my own being.\n\n95. When happiness is dear to me and others equally, what is so\nspecial about me that I strive after happiness only for myself?\n\n96. When fear and suffering are disliked by me and others equally,\nwhat is so special about me that I protect myself and not the other?\n(translation slightly altered from C&S: 96)\n\n\nThis is a far more powerful argument than Mill\u2019s failed\n\u201cproof\u201d of utilitarianism. In highlighting the fundamental\nand undeniable similarity between ourselves and everyone else, it\ncalls us to broaden our concern and care without limit, and to\nrecognize the moral call of suffering and need, wherever they might be\nfound. It stands as a lasting challenge to all those who seek to limit\nthe scope or curtail the demands of morality. This argument was so\ncentral to \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s intellectual and religious\nproject that he made it the very first of the root verses of the\n\u015aS.\n\nYet, it seems, there is a possible answer available to the argument of\nBCA IX.94\u201396. I bear a special relation to my own\nfuture self, one that I do not bear to others. This is the relation of\npersonal identity. Just as it is widely acknowledged that I have\nespecially strong reason to benefit my friends, family members,\nstudents, or others to whom I bear special relations, the objection\ngoes, why should I not have an especially strong prudential reason to\nbenefit myself in the future, someone to whom I bear an even closer,\nsimpler, and more fundamental relation?\n\nThe second part of the passage answers this objection with a line of\nreasoning now commonly known as the Ownerless Suffering Argument. This\nargument draws on the reductionist metaphysics of the Buddhist\nphilosophical tradition known as the Abhidharma. \u015a\u0101ntideva\nwrites:\n\n\nIX.97. If I give them no protection because their suffering does not\nafflict me, why do I protect my body against future suffering when it\ndoes not afflict me?\n\n99. If you think it is for the person who has the pain to guard\nagainst it, a pain in the foot is not of the hand, so why is the one\nprotected by the other?\n\n101. The continuum of consciousness, like a queue, and the combination\nof constituents, like an army, are not real. The person who\nexperiences suffering does not exist. To whom will that suffering\nbelong?\n\n102. Without exception, no sufferings belong to anyone. They must be\nwarded off simply because they are suffering. Why is any limitation\nput on this? (see C&S: 96\u201397)\n\n\nIn response to the objection that personal identity justifies special\nconcern, \u015a\u0101ntideva simply denies that there is a real\nrelation of personal identity. This denial is based on a long\nphilosophical tradition within Buddhism, stretching back to its\nearliest days, of defenses and expositions of the doctrine of no self,\nthe most important and distinctive of all Buddhist teachings. But\n\u015a\u0101ntideva employs that doctrine in what may well have been a\nnovel way. It is quite common for Buddhist texts to assert that if we\ncan realize experientially that there is no substantial self, this\nrealization will cause us to be more altruistic. What\n\u015a\u0101ntideva argues here is that an intellectual understanding\nof the absence of any self can give us reason to affirm altruism as\nsupremely rational and egoism as rationally untenable. In this\nrespect, \u015a\u0101ntideva anticipates the central argument of Derek\nParfit\u2019s celebrated book Reasons and Persons (Parfit\n1984; see especially ch. 14\u201315).\n\nThe fourth argument from metaphysics to ethics analyzed by Lele relies\non the Madhyamaka view that, for \u015a\u0101ntideva, is the deepest\nexpression of the Buddha\u2019s message. This argument is in a way\nmuch simpler than the previous ones: It makes no sense to be attached\nto something that does not ultimately exist. But nothing at all exists\nultimately. So it makes no sense to be attached to anything. As\n\u015a\u0101ntideva writes at BCA IX.150\u201351,\n\n\nWhen all things are empty in this way, what can be received, what\ntaken away?\n\nWho can be honored or humiliated by whom?\n\nFrom what can there be happiness or misery, what can be liked and what\nloathed?\n\nWhat craving can there be? (C&S: 131; see Lele 2015: 32)\n\n\nThis profound reasoning could nevertheless be questioned. Once we\nunderstand that, as major Indian and Tibetan M\u0101dhyamika authors\nare at pains to insist, being empty of intrinsic nature is compatible\nboth with existence and with the capacity to perform a function (see\nTsong kha pa, GT: ch. 14\u201315), is the argument still convincing?\nMany Western scholars have had their doubts. Nevertheless, the view\nthat the ability to see the world of experience directly as empty will\nlead to the extinction of attachment and suffering in the\npractitioner\u2019s mind is a core commitment of Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhism, and its truth or falsity is an empirical matter of the\npsychology of meditation that does not depend on the cogency of\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s reasoning on the topic.\n",
