    "main_text": "Conceptual Matters\n2. Conceptual Matters\n\nIn the twentieth century political philosophers devoted themselves at\nleast as much to the analysis of the problem of political obligation,\nand to the concepts it involves, as to full-scale attempts to devise\ntheories of the obligation to obey the law. Some even argued that the\nexistence of political obligations could be established by conceptual\nanalysis alone \u2013 a point we return to in section 3. More often\nphilosophers working in this vein sought to clarify what was at issue\nin the assertion or denial of political obligations, or duties to obey\nthe law.\n",
