    "main_text": "Final and Formal Causation\n8. Final and Formal Causation\n\nIf Leibniz does not think that perceptions can function as efficient\nor productive causes, why does Leibniz even speak of later perceptions\nas natural consequences of earlier perceptions, if not causally? There\nseem to be two good reasons for this. First, there is a purpose or end\nguiding the unfolding of perceptions in each substance. The substance\n(or primitive power) acts efficiently in order to fulfill this end.\nSuch an end may be called a final cause. Second, Leibniz wishes to\nground his Law of Continuity\u2014that all change in nature is\ncontinuous (i.e., in nature there are no gaps). This points to formal\ncausation in substances. In other words, the picture we come away with\nin Leibniz is that a substance\u2019s perceptions, representing final\nand formal causes, rationally determine that substance\u2019s future\nstates. The object of a perception is a final cause insofar as each\nperception specifies why certain states should be produced rather than\nothers. Perceptions themselves are formal causes insofar as they\nspecify the content of a substance\u2019s future states.\n\nLet\u2019s first consider how the objects of perceptions operate as\nfinal causes. Leibniz speaks of perceptual states as unfolding\nspontaneously in monads according to a metaphysically basic order of\ncausal relations. But the fact that perceptions are automatically and\nirreducibly causally ordered need only mean that \u201cprior\u201d\nperceptions contain the reason for subsequent perceptions. This is the\nway Jan Cover puts it: Temporal priority depends on a relation of\n\u201cinvolves a reason for\u201d (Cover, 317). Now, according to\nLeibniz, \u201cA reason is a known truth whose connection with some\nless well-known truth leads us to give our assent to the latter. But\nit is called reason, especially and par excellence, if it is the cause\nnot only of our judgment but also of the truth itself\u2014which\nmakes it known as an a priori reason\u201d (New Essays A vi,\n6, 475). As mentioned earlier, Leibniz also speaks of appetitions as a\nsubstance\u2019s \u201ctendencies to go from one perception to\nanother\u201d (GP vi, 598/AG 207). That perceptions come and go\naccording to final causes is apparent in the following passage from\nthe Principles of Nature and Grace \u00a73:\n\u201cperceptions in the monad arise from one another by the laws of\nappetites, or by the laws of the final causes of good and evil, which\nconsist in notable perceptions, ordered or disordered\u201d (GP vi,\n598/AG 207). Leibniz writes in the same work: \u201cthe future can be\nread in the past; the distant is expressed in the proximate\u201d (GP\nvi, 605/AG 211). The moral is that perceptions function as\nteleological explananda, which is reminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s\naccount of final causation, where natural processes are completed and\nregulated by a final state or end, towards which they tend.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Leibniz does not limit his doctrine of\nfinal causation to the conscious activity of rational agents, for he\nholds that a mental state can function as a final cause without our\nbeing aware of it. In a letter to Sophie Charlotte, Leibniz writes:\n\u201cSo that even in our instinctive or involuntary actions, where\nit seems only the body plays a part, there is in the soul an appetite\nfor good or an aversion to evil which directs it, even though our\nreflection is not able to pick it out in the confusion\u201d (GP III,\n347; WF 224f.). Nor does Leibniz restrict final causation to rational\nagents. (Nor does Aristotle for that matter.) The final cause of a\nplant or an animal is not a plan or intention. Rather, it is whatever\nlies at the end of the regular series of developmental changes that it\nundergoes. \n\nLet\u2019s now explain the presence of formal causation in\nperception. Some thinkers contemporaneous with Leibniz, most notably\nPierre Bayle, found the apparent lack of continuity among our\nperceptions to be deeply problematic. We are often genuinely surprised\nby the content of our perceptions, some of which seem utterly\ndisconnected from and radically unlike prior perceptions. But, given\nthe Law of Continuity, Leibniz cannot allow perceptions to arise in a\nmonad that are radically unlike preceding perceptions. To solve this\nproblem, Leibniz offers his theory of petites or unconscious\nperceptions and says that this apparent lack of continuity in the\nactions of the individual substance results from our overlooking the\ncomplex multitude of unconscious perceptions, which flow, at every\nmoment, from the individual\u2019s nature. But the doctrine of petite\nperceptions alone is not sufficient to ground continuity. Rather, it\nis the rational relation among perceptions that serves to guarantee\ncontinuity in perceptual content. Leibniz speaks of the \u201cmarks\n[les marques]\u201d that each perception of a substance\ncontains for all other perceptions that substance will ever have\n(Discourse on Metaphysics \u00a78). I take it that this\nrelation among perceptions points to perceptions being formal causes;\nthat is to say, a substance\u2019s present states specify fully the\ncontent of its future states.\n\nSo, to summarize, what causes the changes in perceptions? Three\nspecies of cause: efficient causes (in accordance with laws of mind\nand active forces), final causes (in accordance with the law of\nappetites and ultimately God\u2019s aim of universal and maximum\nharmony), and formal causes (in accordance with the Law of\nContinuity). Leibniz\u2019s account of intrasubstantial causation\ntherefore involves a tight connection between efficient, final, and\nformal causes. This should not be surprising, since Leibniz tells us\nthat \u201c[a] cause in the realm of things corresponds to a reason\nin the realm of truths, which is why causes themselves\u2014and\nespecially final ones\u2014are often called reasons\u201d (New\nEssays A vi, 6, 475).\n\nNone of this should be surprising. Hume may have endorsed just one\nspecies of cause\u2014efficient\u2014but final and formal causation\ndid not die with the advent of mechanistic science and philosophy in\nthe seventeenth century. Besides Leibniz, Gassendi, Boyle, and Newton\nall accommodated final or teleological causation in their systems.\nSpinoza is really the only known philosopher in the seventeenth\ncentury who truly has no place for final causation in his philosophy,\nexcept in the sense that artifacts have final causes (e.g., chairs\nserve a purpose and carpenters create them in part to achieve that\npurpose). On the other hand, Spinoza probably does endorse formal\ncausation in his metaphysics of substance.\n",
