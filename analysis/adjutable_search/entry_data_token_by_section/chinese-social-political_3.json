    "main_text": "The Classical Era || Mozi: Theological or Utilitarian Justification?\n2.2 Mozi: Theological or Utilitarian Justification?\n\nRoughly contemporary with the Guanzi is the Mozi,\none chapter of which begins:\n\n\nIn ancient times, when people were first born and before there were\nany punishments or government, in their languages each had a different\nnotion of rightness (yi). One man had one notion, two men had\ntwo\u2026. Thus those with good doctrines would keep them secret and\nrefuse to teach them. (MZ ch. 11, p. 91, translation significantly\nmodified by author)\n\n\nThis of course led to chaos and suffering, the cause of which was the\nabsence of \u201ca leader to govern\u201d. A ruler was therefore\nselected, declared the \u201cSon of Heaven\u201d, and provided with\na staff of ministers to aid him. The ruler then established the single\nidea of rightness that all would heed. The text describes a\ncomprehensive hierarchy according to which each individual would heed\nhis or her superior\u2019s judgment as to what was \u201cgood\n(shan)\u201d, ultimately leading up to the ruler who would\nbase his judgment on Heaven.\n\n\u201cHeaven (tian)\u201d is a difficult term. It once\nclearly referred to a religious entity, but eventually comes to be\nunderstood in more naturalistic terms. Which it means in this chapter\nis a matter of scholarly disagreement. For the most part, Warring\nStates philosophers of governance do not appeal to supernatural\nstandards to justify their claims. Even in the Mozi, if one\ntakes evidence from other chapters into account, the interpretive\ndispute over \u201ctian\u201d may be moot. These other\nchapters record that just as carpenters can use a compass to determine\nwhat is circular, so an understanding of the \u201cwill of\nHeaven\u201d leads one to reliably judge what is right. The striking\nthing about a compass is that no special knowledge is needed to use\nit: it is a public, objective standard for circles. If the \u201cwill\nof Heaven\u201d is to be analogous, then there must be a public,\nobjective standard for right. Mysterious knowledge of the will of a\ndeity does not sound like a good candidate for such a public,\nobjective standard. The text offers an alternative, though: it\nregularly speaks of maximally \u201cbenefitting (li)\u201d\nthe people as a standard. A neat way of resolving all these loose\nends, then, is to conclude that the \u201cwill of Heaven\u201d is a\nmetaphorical reference to the standard of \u201cbenefit\u201d.\nProper Mohist governance thus would ultimately be a matter of\nutilitarian judgment. \n",
