    "main_text": "Essentialism\n5. Essentialism\n\n\u201cEssentialists\u201d claim that there is a \u201ccommon core\u201d to all\nmystical experiences independent of culture. That is, the common\nlow-ramified accounts of mystical experiences in different cultures\nand eras reveal that a universal mystical consciousness\n\u2014 the PCE \u2014 grounds all the different cultural\nexpressions. Alternatively, at least there is a shared\ncommonality of certain phenomenological features in all mystical\nexperiences that is invariant from culture to culture and era to era\neven if all mystical experiences are constructed and so each mystical\nexperience is flavored differently by a particular\nculture. This universal state of consciousness is\nindependent of any religion or culture and produces some\ncommon phenomenological features in all types of mystical experiences.\nThe common core is always culturally mediated in the\nexpressions of each mystic\u2019s culture, but this does not erase\nthe experiential uniformity since experience and interpretation can be\ndistinguished.\n\nThus, essentialists argue there is only one type of\nmystical experience or that all types of mystical experiences\nshare common phenomenological features. For many essentialists\ntoday, the common physiology or neurology of all people regardless of\nculture is responsible for this commonality, not any alleged\nobjects of mystical experiences.\n\nStace\u2019s essentialism has generated much discussion\n(Stace 1960). He proposes two mystical experiences found \u201cin all\ncultures, religions, periods, and social conditions.\u201d First,\nhe identifies a universal extrovertive experience that apprehends\nthe One or the Oneness of all in or through the multiplicity of the\nphenomenal world that is the inner life or consciousness of the\nworld. The Oneness is experienced as a sacred objective\nreality in a feeling of \u201cbliss\u201d or \u201cjoy.\u201d This universal\nextrovertive experience (or the experienced reality, it is not always\nclear which) is paradoxical, and possibly ineffable (Stace 1960,\n79). Second, Stace identifies a\nuniversal monistic introvertive experience that \u201clooks\ninward into the mind\u201d to achieve \u201cpure consciousness\u201d \u2014\ni.e., an experience phenomenologically not of anything but\nconsciousness (Stace 1960, 86) \u2014 i.e, a PCE. Stace calls\nthis the \u201cunitary consciousness\u201d or the \u201cvoid and empty unity\u201d\nthat is left when all empirical content is excluded (Stace 1960,\n110). Like his extrovertive experience, Stace\u2019s universal\nintrovertive experience involves a blissful sense of sacred\nobjectivity and is paradoxical and possibly ineffable. Stace\nconsiders the universal introvertive experience to be a ripening of\nmystical awareness beyond the halfway house of the universal\nextrovertive consciousness.\n\nStace assimilates theistic mystical experiences to the PCE by\ndistinguishing between experience and interpretation: theistic mystics\nare conditioned (perhaps subconsciously) by their surroundings to\nput a theistic interpretation on their empty introvertive experiences.\nNinian Smart (1965) concurs: descriptions of theistic mystical\nexperiences reflect an interpretive overlay upon an experiential base\ncommon to both theistic and non-theistic experiences.\n\nThe psychologist Ralph Hood (2006 and 2017)\nargues that psychometric studies provide \u201cstrong empirical\nsupport\u201d for the common core thesis. Does the fact that\nneuroscientists have found different patterns in the brain for\ndifferent types of mystical experiences and meditative practices (see\nSection 9.7) mean that the experiences must be different? Even if\nthere is a common neural basis to all mystical experiences, does it\nmean that the phenomenology of the experiences must be identical?\n\nStace has been strongly criticized for simplifying or distorting\nmystical reports (see Moore 1973 for a summary) and for failing\nto properly articulate the differences between extrovertive and\nintrovertive experiences (e.g., Almond 1982, chap. 4). Nelson\nPike (1992, chap. 5) criticized the Stace-Smart position\nbecause in Christian mysticism union with God is divided into\ndiscernible phases, which finds no basis in Christian theology. Thus,\nthese phases plausibly reflect experience, not a culturally-controlled\ninterpretation.\n\nIn contrast to Stace and essentialism in general, R. C. Zaehner\nidentified three distinct types of mystical consciousness: (1) a\n\u201cpanenhenic\u201d extrovertive experience in which\none experiences the oneness of nature, one\u2019s self\nincluded; (2) a \u201cmonistic\u201d experience of an undifferentiated unity\ntranscending space and time; and (3) the \u201ctheistic\u201d experience\nwhere there is a duality between the subject and the object of the\nexperience (Zaehner 1957). Zaehner thought that theistic\nexperiences are an advance over the monistic since the latter, he\nthought, express a self-centered interest of the mystic to be\nincluded in the ultimate. But in his typology he had to tell\nBuddhists what their experiences really were (type 2) despite their\nexplicit rejection of that position. He later admitted that Zen\nmystical experiences did not fit his typology.\n",
