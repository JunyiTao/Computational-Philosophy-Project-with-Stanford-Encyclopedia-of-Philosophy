    "main_text": "The Varieties of Contemporary Deflationism || Prosententialism\n3.3 Prosententialism\n\nAs emerges from the discussion of Grover, et al. (1975) in\nSection 2, prosententialism is the form of deflationism that contrasts\nthe most with inflationism, rejecting even the latter\u2019s initial\nassumption that the alethic locutions function as predicates. Partly\nin response to the difficulties confronting Grover, et\nal.\u2019s prosentential account, Robert Brandom (1988 and 1994)\nhas developed a variation on their view with an important\nmodification. In place of taking the underlying logic of\n\u2018true\u2019 as having this expression occur only as a\nnon-separable component of the semantically atomic prosentential\nexpressions, \u2018that is true\u2019 and \u2018it is true\u2019,\nBrandom treats \u2018is true\u2019 as a separable\nprosentence-forming operator. \u201cIt applies to a\nterm that is a sentence nominalization or that refers to or picks out\na sentence tokening. It yields a prosentence that has that tokening as\nits anaphoric antecedent\u201d (Brandom 1994, 305). In this way,\nBrandom\u2019s account avoids most of the paraphrase concerns that\nGrover, et al.\u2019s prosententialism faces, while still\nmaintaining prosententialism\u2019s rejection of the contention that\nthe alethic locutions function predicatively. As a consequence of his\noperator approach, Brandom gives quantificational uses of prosentences\na slightly different analysis. He (re)expands instances of truth-talk\nlike the following,\n\n(9)\nEverything Smith says is true.\n\n\n(10)\nSomething Jones said is true.\n\n\n\u201cback\u201d into longer forms, such as\n\n(8*)\nFor anything one can say, if Smith says it, then it is true.\n\n\n(11)\nFor something one can say, Jones said it, and it is true.\n\n\nand explains only the second \u2018it\u2019 as involved in a\nprosentence. The first \u2018it\u2019 in (8*) and (11) still\nfunctions as a pronoun, anaphorically linked to a set of noun\nphrases (sentence nominalizations) supplying objects (sentence\ntokenings) as a domain being quantified over with standard (as opposed\nto sentential or \u201cpropositional\u201d) quantifiers (ibid.,\n302).\n\nBrandom presents a highly flexible view that takes \u2018is\ntrue\u2019 as a general \u201cdenominalizing\u201d device that\napplies to singular terms formed from the nominalization of sentences\nbroadly, not just to pronouns that indicate them. A sentence like\n\u2018It is true that humans are causing climate change\u2019,\nconsidered via a re-rendering as \u2018That humans are\ncausing climate change is true\u2019, is already a\nprosentence on his view, as is a quote-name case like\n\u201c\u2018Birds are dinosaurs\u2019 is true\u201d, and an opaque\ninstance of truth-talk like \u2018Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture is\ntrue\u2019. In this way, Brandom offers a univocal and broader\nprosentential account, according to which, \u201c[i]n each use, a\nprosentence will have an anaphoric antecedent that determines a class\nof admissible substituends for the prosentence (in the lazy case, a\nsingleton). This class of substituends determines the significance of\nthe prosentence associated with it\u201d (ibid.). As a result,\nBrandom can accept both (ES-sent) and (ES-prop) \u2013 the latter\nunderstood as involving no commitment to propositions as entities\n\u2013 on readings closer to their standard interpretations, taking\nthe instances of both to express meaning equivalences. Brandom\u2019s\naccount thus seems to be located in both position \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and\nposition \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) in the chart from Section 1.1, although, as\nwith any prosententialist view, it still denies that the instances of\n(ES) say anything about either sentences or propositions.\n\nDespite its greater flexibility, however, Brandom\u2019s account\nstill faces the central worry confronting prosentential views, namely\nthat truth-talk really does seem predicative, and not just in its\nsurface grammatical form but in our inferential practices with it as\nwell. In arguing for the superiority of his view over that of Grover,\net al., Brandom states that \u201c[t]he account of truth\ntalk should bear the weight of \u2026 divergence of logical from\ngrammatical form only if no similarly adequate account can be\nconstructed that lacks this feature\u201d (ibid., 304). One might\nfind it plausible to extend this principle beyond grammatical form, to\nbehavior in inferences as well. This is an abiding concern for\nattempts to resist inflationism by rejecting its initial assumption,\nnamely, that the alethic locutions function as predicates.\n",
