    "main_text": "\n\nThe analysis of descriptions has played an important\u00a0role in\ndebates about metaphysics, epistemology, semantics, psychology, logic\nand linguistics ever since the publication of Bertrand Russell\u2019s paper\n\u201cOn Denoting,\u201d in 1905.\u00a0 Despite the apparent\nsimplicity of definite and indefinite descriptions, the past 100+\nyears have seen heated debates about their proper analysis. For\nexample, some philosophers and linguists treat definite descriptions\nas referential expressions, others treat them as quantificational\nexpressions, and some treat them as predicational expressions. Other\nanalyses of descriptions have held that the determiners\n\u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 do not make a semantical\ncontribution, but rather a pragmatic contribution to what is\ncommunicated. Some recent work in linguistics has even called into\nquestion the idea that definite and indefinite determiners correspond\nto logical elements in natural language.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs we will see, none of this undermines the idea that some expressions\nin natural language are referential and others quantificational, or\nthat the analysis of these questions isn\u2019t relevant to\nRussell\u2019s epistemological and metaphysical projects, but it is\nto suggest that the role of the English words \u2018the\u2019 and\n\u2018a\u2019 (and their counterparts in other languages) may be\nless clear than philosophers in the century following Russell\u2019s paper\nhave imagined.\n",
