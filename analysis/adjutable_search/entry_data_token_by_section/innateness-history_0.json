Prehistory: Empedocles vs. Anaxagoras\n\n\nEven before the competing positions on innateness were delineated,\nreflective thinkers were drawn to one or the other pole of the\ncontroversy. We can already see a precursor of the debate in the\nopposing theories of knowledge of the pre-Socratic philosophers\nEmpedocles and Anaxagoras.\n\n\nThe poetic Empedocles, who speculated that reality is the product of\never-recurring cycles of Love and Strife, held that sensation,\nperception, and even wisdom, is a matter of knowing \u201clike by\n like\u201d.[1]\nHis rival\nAnaxagoras held that \u201cperception is by\n opposites\u201d.[2]\n One way to read these obscure fragments is to see them as emblematic\nof two different ways of thinking about the mind. For Empedocles, the\nmind is made for the world. Mind grasps reality because it is\npre-tuned to the world and resonates with it. For Anaxagoras, the\nworld has to impress itself upon us; to shape our unformed minds into\nits form. This image of the world \u2018informing\u2019 the\nknower becomes the tabula rasa of 17th century\nEmpiricism. But there is another connection. Empedocles, with his\ncycles of Love and Strife, is unabashedly speculative.  Anaxagoras, on\nthe other hand, comes down to us as \u201cdry, clear-headed,\n\u2026[having a] common sense attitude\u201d. This difference in\nintellectual personality is reflected in the subsequent debate.\nEmpedocles would be very much at home with the Nativistic Rationalist\nphilosophers and their \u201crather dreamlike vision of the\nuniverse\u201d, as Bernard Williams has put it. The British\nEmpiricists are more likely to share Anaxagoras\u2019 commonsensical\nimpatience with such flights of fancy.\n\n\nOne last parallel worth noting while we have these early figures in\nview is the very radical nature of Empedocles\u2019 Nativism. The\nfragment can be read as saying that all our modes of\nunderstanding are somehow mirrored in our makeup. Despite their\nvery different philosophical commitments and interests, ancient,\nmodern, and contemporary Nativists are all drawn to this\ntotalistic version of the doctrine. It is not so much\nthat they all defend this radical position, but they are all at least\nattracted to it. The prevailing thought is that something about\nthe nature of concepts (ideas, knowledge etc.) per se pushes us to the\nNativist position.\n",
