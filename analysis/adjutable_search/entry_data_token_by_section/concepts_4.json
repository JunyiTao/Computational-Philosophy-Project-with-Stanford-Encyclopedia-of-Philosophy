    "main_text": "The structure of concepts\n2. The structure of concepts\n\nJust as thoughts are composed of concepts, many concepts are\nthemselves complex entities that are composed of other concepts or\nmore basic representational components. In this section, we look at\ndifferent proposals about the structure of what are often called\nlexical concepts. Roughly speaking, these are concepts that\ntend to be associated with individual words in natural\nlanguage\u2014concepts like BIRD and WALK as opposed to manifestly\ncomplex concepts like NOCTURNAL ANIMALS THAT LIVE IN TREES or TO WALK\nAIMLESSLY ON A NEWLY PAVED ROAD. With BIRD and WALK and similar\nconcepts, it isn\u2019t obvious what type of internal structure (if\nany) they have, and this has led to a great deal of controversy\n(Margolis & Laurence 1999, Murphy 2002). Accounts of the structure\nof lexical concepts have focused on concepts for categories of\nobjects, actions, and events rather than concepts for individuals. Our\ndiscussion will share this focus (see, e.g., Blok et al. 2005 and\nLevine 2010 for discussion of concepts of individuals).\n",
