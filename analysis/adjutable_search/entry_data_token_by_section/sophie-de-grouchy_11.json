    "main_text": "Philosophy || Moral Psychology\n4.1 Moral Psychology\n\nGrouchy\u2019s moral philosophy cannot be defined in terms of one\nparticular influence. Her arguments carefully weave together elements\nfrom what we would recognize now as distinct ethical theories: ancient\nvirtue ethics, stoicism, and utilitarianism.\n4.1.1 Early modern developmental psychology\n\nLocke was a major influence in eighteenth century moral psychology,\nespecially through his Thoughts on Education in which he\nargued that every aspect of an infant\u2019s experience contributes\nto her moral and cognitive development. Like him, Grouchy traces the\ndevelopment of morality to infancy, arguing that its first sources\noccur \u201cin the cradle\u201d when an infant experiences the pain\nof being separated from her nurse and the pleasure of being reunited\nwith her.\n\nFrom Locke, but also Condillac, Grouchy takes the idea that cognitive\ndevelopment is primarily physiological at source, but can lead, with\nthe proper education, to the development of moral sentiment on the one\nhand (the soul) and of abstract ideas on the other (the mind). The two\ntogether, for Grouchy, gives us the idea of justice.\n4.1.2 Physiology\n\nThe most important physiologist thinker during Grouchy\u2019s\nlifetime was her brother in law Pierre-Georges Cabanis. In 1796, two\nyears before the publication of the Letters, but four years\nafter they were first drafted, Cabanis presented a number of lectures\non a topic that was central to the most original parts of\nGrouchy\u2019s response to Smith, namely, the role of the sensations\nof pleasure and pain in bringing about sympathy, and ultimately\nmorality. His lectures were printed in 1802 under the title Les\nRapports du Physique et du Moral. Arguing that morality was the\nresult of reasoning about sensations, Cabanis proposed that\n\u201cmoral properties were nothing but physical properties\nconsidered from certain particular points of view\u201d and that\n\n\n[i]t is from that point of view that the physical study of man is\nprincipally interesting: this is where the philosopher, the moralist,\nthe legislator must direct their gaze, and where they can find at the\nsame time new lights on human nature, and fundamental ideas on its\nperfectioning. (Cabanis 1802: 78, 80)\n\n\nGrouchy agrees with Cabanis that the ultimate source of human\ndevelopment is physical, and this is how she departs from\nSmith\u2019s account of sympathy. Smith acknowledges that sympathy\nexists as part of human psychology, but Grouchy insists on tracing its\norigins and finds them in sensations of pleasure and pain. While\nCabanis is mostly interested in finding physiological correspondences\nfor particular moral or psychological phenomena, Grouchy, starting\nfrom simply physiological sources, builds a complex and complete\ntheory of moral development, which starts from particular and personal\nattachments and ends in the love of humanity in general.\n4.1.3 Pleasure and pain\n\nThe first causes of sympathy, Grouchy argues, are the sensations of\npains and pleasure one experiences as part of our relationship to\nanother. A baby who finds comfort at the breast of its nurse will\nexperience pain when it is separated from it, and later learn to\nrecognize and care for the pain experienced by the nurse. Grouchy\ndistinguishes between physical and moral pleasures and pains on the\none hand, and present and remembered pleasures and pains on the other.\nShe also argues that we can derive abstract ideas of pleasures and\npains.\n4.1.4 Stoicism\n\nThe principal Stoic element in the Letters on Sympathy is the\nway in which Grouchy describes the development of sympathy as\nreminiscent of the Stoic \u201ccradle arguments,\u201d that is,\noffering a description of infant behavior as evidence of what is\nnatural to human beings and not merely conventional. Stoic cradle\narguments often invoke the concept of oikeiosis. The Stoics\nclaim that what can be observed in infants is a natural concern for\nself-preservation. This tendency, oikeiosis, naturally grows\nto extend one\u2019s tendencies towards self-preservation to an\nimpartial concern for all (Annas 1993: 265). Animals and young\nchildren are capable of the early stages of the process\u2014that of\nrecognizing their own bodies as belonging to them, and learning how to\nuse them for their own survival. Mature animals are also able to\nengage in later stage of oikeiosis, that of caring for their\nyoung. Human oikeiosis starts as it does with animals, but\ndevelops further\u2014as far as cosmopolitanism.\n\nThe development of sympathy in Grouchy follows a similar pattern. We\nstart in infancy by recognizing our own pains and pleasures, those\nthat signal to us what we need to stay alive. From this the circle of\nsympathy is widened to include others who form part of our life,\nstarting with the observations of physical pleasures and pains, in\noneself and in others, then moving towards psychological sufferings,\nand extending the circle further to humanity in general.\n4.1.5 Utilitarianism\n\nGrouchy\u2019s strong emphasis on pain and pleasure might suggest\nthat her moral theoretical leanings are towards consequentialism\nrather than Stoicism. And indeed some of her discussions of what it\nmeans to do the right thing seem to be informed by consequentialism.\nIn Letter V, she claims that acts receive reason\u2019s approval\ndepending on the extent to which they benefit humanity. In Letter\nVIII, she suggests that the value of the law can be measured in part\nin terms of the pleasure and pain it produces.\n\nCabanis (C***) agreed with Grouchy that the ability to see and\nrecognize pain was central to sympathy and ultimately to morality, but\nhe also sought to reconcile this with a form of Stoicism. What\nattracted Cabanis\u2014and presumably Grouchy\u2014to Stoic\nphilosophy was the possibility it opened for a form of atheism that\nnonetheless saw something divinely pleasing in all living things.\nCabanis\u2019s last work is a defense of hylozoism rather than the\nmaterialism he is known for, i.e., the view that spirit, as reason, is\neverywhere, and most especially in humans and \u201chigher\u201d\nanimals. But nonetheless, Cabanis explicitly rejects the Stoic view\nthat pains and pleasure don\u2019t matter morally, and indeed,\nsuggests that even the Stoics did not believe this:\n\n\nWe cannot possibly agree with the Stoics that pain is not bad. Perhaps\npain is not always bad in its effects\u2014it can offer useful\nwarnings, sometimes even strengthens physical organs just as it\nimpresses greater energy and strength of will to morality. [\u2026]\nBut if pain was not an evil it would not be so for others anymore than\nfor ourselves. We should discount it in others and in ourselves. So\nwhy this tender humaneness that characterizes the greatest stoics much\nmore than the firmness and the constancy of their virtues? (Cabanis\n1824: 84)\n\n\nCabanis goes on to cite Cato, who gave up his horse for his companion\non a scorching road in Sicily, and Brutus, who gave his coat to a sick\nslave on a freezing winter night. Stoics themselves do not countenance\nthe view that pain should be ignored when it comes to acting.\nTherefore, one can be an ethical stoic and make the relief of pain\ncentral to one\u2019s morality.\n4.2 Political Philosophy\n4.2.1 Liberty\n\nSince the revival of neo-republican thought in contemporary political\nphilosophy, several philosophers of the past have been re-interpreted\nas republican thinkers. This is the case, for instance, with Mary\nWollstonecraft, who until recently was thought of as a liberal\nthinker, is now seen by many as an important source for feminist\nrepublicanism (Halldenius 2015; Berges & Coffee 2016). Although we\nshould be weary of reading too much contemporary political theory into\npast thinkers, in particular when it comes to very technical arguments\nand definitions, it is nonetheless often helpful to focus on the\ncentral themes of republican thought in order to understand these\nthinkers. In particular, the Revolutionary engagement with liberty was\nvery often framed in Roman terms with arguments that to become a\nrepublic was to become free from domination by an arbitrary power.\nThese thoughts resonated particularly strongly, and sometimes\ndifferently for women philosophers as they considered whether their\npositions as wives and daughters in a patriarchal society meant that\nthey too were dominated, and would carry on being so in a republic\nunless marriage and family laws were reformed. This was the focus of\nMary Wollstonecraft and Olympe de Gouges, but it was less so in the\ncase of Grouchy, who to some extent relied on her husband\u2019s more\npowerful and influential voice to propose feminist reforms.\n\nPlacing Grouchy in a republican context highlights the importance of\nher work for the French Revolution and vice versa. Few political\nphilosophers write in a vacuum; most are influenced by or wish to\ninfluence the events unfolding around them. But when the events are as\nremarkable as a revolution, then it makes no sense to ignore their\nimpact on the work we are looking at. In the case of Grouchy, it is\neven clearer that she wished to participate, through her writings, in\nthe making of the new Republic; in the summer of 1791, together with\nCondorcet and a few friends, she established a political journal,\nLe R\u00e9publicain, the purpose of which was to enlighten\nthe public as to what republicanism was.\n\nLe R\u00e9publicain lasted for just over a month, framed by\ntwo events: Louis XVI\u2019s attempted escape from France, and the\nChamp de Mars Massacre. The aim of Le R\u00e9publicain\nstated in its opening article, \u201cAvis aux Fran\u00e7ais,\u201d\nwas to promote the ideal of republicanism, attempting to make it more\nrespectable and better understood than it was at the time: \u201cto\nenlighten minds on the subject of republicanism, which is slandered\nbecause it is misunderstood\u201d. (Condorcet and Paine 1792, p.5\n\nA theme that is strongly present in all the articles of Le\nR\u00e9publicain, including the ones attributed to Grouchy, is\nthe threat to freedom constituted by any monarchy, no matter how\nwell-intentioned the monarch is. In this, Grouchy and the other\nauthors of the R\u00e9publicain differ from republicans\ninspired by Montesquieu, such as Siey\u00e8s, who believed that the\nform of government was incidental to a republican constitution as long\nas the ruler always acted in the public interest. Grouchy and others\ndisagreed on the grounds that the hereditary power granted to a\nmonarch is always arbitrary, so that even if it is benign, it is not\nreliably so. It does not matter, says Paine, whether a monarch is\n\u201ca fool a hypocrite or a tyrant\u201d\u2014what matters is\nthat this individual has \u201cabsolute power\u201d over everyone,\nincluding those who are not yet born (Condorcet and Paine 1792, p.5. A\nmonarch who is well intentioned may change his attitude for personal\nreasons and become a tyrant, or he may die and leave the power in the\nhands of a tyrannical successor.\n4.2.2 Equality\n\nPhilosophers of the French revolution were interested in equality as\nwell as liberty (fraternity was added later to the motto), but the\nequality that concerned them was equality of status, specifically\ncivic status, rather than political status. Very few of them even\nthought about economic equality. Sophie de Grouchy wrote that all\ncitizens are owed the same respect, and this implies that there should\nnot be extreme economic inequality.\n\nThe central argument of Grouchy\u2019s Letters is that\nvirtue, moral or political, is born out of sympathy, the ability and\npropensity to feel others\u2019 pain and to want to relieve it.\nGrouchy claims that we first experience sympathy as an infant in the\narms of a nurse, and that we learn progressively to feel sympathy for\nthe physical and mental pain that any other person experiences,\nwhether or not we are close to them. But in order for this to be\npossible, we do need to see the suffering other as a human being, as\nsomeone just as capable of experiencing pain as we are. Extreme\ninequality means that this does not happen: the very rich and the very\npoor do not regard each other as being part of the same species, so\nthat they cannot sympathize with each other and will not apply the\nlaws of morality and justice in their dealings with each other (Letter\nVIII).\n\nGrouchy\u2019s concrete proposal to reduce extreme inequality does\nnot include even the possibility of future inequality. She assumes\nthat without legally supported inequality, natural inequalities (in\nintelligence and fecundity) would result in three quarters of the land\nbeing distributed randomly according to luck and skill and one quarter\ndistributed equally between families. But this, she argues, with\nfigures at hand, would still exclude extreme poverty or extreme wealth\nand would be sufficient to ensure that all citizens recognized each\nother as equally worthy of respect.\n\nAlthough there is definitely a feminist background to Grouchy\u2019s\nLetters, one which reflects her husband\u2019s 1790 paper on\nthe inclusion of women to the rights of the city, and perhaps in fact\ninspired that paper, it does not have a clear or central feminist\nagenda. Humanity in general is the focus of her discussion; women are\nexplicitly included in the arguments (indeed, the very first teacher\nof sympathy is the wet-nurse, the most prominent example given of a\ngood teacher is Sophie\u2019s own mother, and mothers and fathers are\nequally enjoined to participate in a child\u2019s proper education)\nbut they are not given separate consideration. In her discussion of\nfamily law, she does mention reforms that would affect women more\nparticularly.\n4.3 Legal Philosophy\n4.3.1 Citizenship\n\nIn her defense of equality, Sophie de Grouchy considers the problems\nbrought about by inequality of status, privileges, and wealth and the\nway in which the law contributes to these problems by maintaining\nprivileges. She is in agreement with the principles debated in the\nearly days of the French revolution, in particular by Emmanuel\nSiey\u00e8s who argued that to be unequal in the eyes of the law is\nto be potentially dominated. That is, a citizen can use a privileged\nrelationship to the law to abuse another. Grouchy argues that this was\none the greatest wrongs of the Ancient R\u00e9gime, i.e., when the\nlaw is not applied equally to all, those who cannot manipulate it\nperceive themselves as dominated:\n\n\n[When the law allows for] privileges, hereditary, personal or local\nwhich offer a legal loophole, direct or indirect, [t]hen the people\nare tempted to see criminal laws as made against them and in favor of\nthe rich, as the result of an association designed to oppress them.\n(Letter VIII, p. 152\n\n4.3.2 Punishment\n\nMuch of Grouchy\u2019s discussion of the law focuses of the question\nof punishment. Before 1789, there were a number of ways in which the\nlaw could kill its criminals depending both on the kind of crime they\nhad committed and their station. Aristocrats were decapitated with a\nsword. This was regarded as the most honorable death, although it was\nnot always the least painful or horrible. The Count Lally-Tollendal,\nwho received the death penalty in 1766 for having betrayed the\nKing\u2019s interest at war, had to be hit three times by the sword\nbefore his neck could be broken and the head detached. Sanson, the\nexecutor of the Revolution, cited his example when defending the\nproposed new machine that would cut heads off neatly and instantly.\nNonetheless, decapitation was more honorable than the sentences\nreserved for commoners of death by hanging (murderers) or the wheel\n(thieves, highway robbers). The crime women were most commonly accused\nof was infanticide or performing abortions. These were punished by\nhanging when they were found guilty of having killed their infants,\nbut, as was most often the case, when evidence was lacking, they would\ndo prison time for fornication, or be freed until more evidence could\nbe found.\n\nGrouchy\u2019s discussion of punishment is clearly influenced by the\nwritings of the Milanese criminologist Cesare Beccaria. Beccaria had\nalready argued for the necessity of equal penalties for all as even\nprivileges must rest on an equal respect for the law. His book On\nCrimes and Punishment published in 1764 was translated in French\nthat same year and published with a lengthy commentary from Voltaire.\nBeccaria came to Paris and spent much of 1776 in Madame\nHelvetius\u2019s salon in Auteuil. His influence was no doubt still\npresent some years later when the Marquis de Condorcet, and their\nfuture brother-in-law Pierre-George Cabanis, and later\nCondorcet\u2019s wife Sophie de Grouchy also became frequent\nvisitors. This, as well as Condorcet\u2019s close connection with\nVoltaire, and his own engagement at the time Beccaria\u2019s book was\npublished in penal reform, goes some way towards explaining\nGrouchy\u2019s affinities with Beccaria\u2019s claims. In her\nLetters on Sympathy, she argues that:\n\n\nIn order for the fear of a sentence to be effective and beneficial the\nsentence must not outrage. Its justice must be perceptible to average\nreason, and it must especially awaken the conscience, at the same time\nas it punishes its silence and slumber. But this will not be so\n[\u2026] if a judge can arbitrarily harden or soften a sentence; if\nthere are privileges, hereditary, personal or local which offer a\nlegal loophole, direct or indirect. (Letter VIII)\n\n4.3.3 Marriage and family laws\n\nDivorce was legalized and made more accessible for a brief period\nduring the French Revolution before it was codified under Napoleon in\na way that made much more difficult to obtain, especially for women.\nGrouchy in her Letters argues in favor not only of divorce,\nbut of short-term, renewable marriage contracts and clear rights for\nchildren born outside marriage and for their mothers. In these she is\nin agreement with another woman philosopher of the Revolution, Olympe\nde Gouges. Grouchy derived these arguments at least in part from\nMontesquieu\u2019s analysis of the Roman law in the Spirit of the\nLaw.\n4.3.4 Commercial law\n\nGrouchy also argued that a heavily regulated market increased poverty,\nforcing the poor to remain poor, or even become poorer because they\ncouldn\u2019t regulate their exchanges or negotiate their work and\nproduction fairly. Grouchy, like Condorcet and Turgot, believed that\nshackling the market with strict laws was a form of domination and\nthat allowing farmers and merchants to set their own prices would go\nsome way towards relieving poverty in the country. Thus she can be\ninterpreted as one of the original defenders of commercial\nrepublicanism (Berg\u00e8s 2018a).",
