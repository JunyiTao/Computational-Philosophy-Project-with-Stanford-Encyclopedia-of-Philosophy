    "main_text": "Meritocratic Justice || The meritocratic distribution of income\n4.3 The meritocratic distribution of income\n\nMeritocrats most commonly hold that economies ought to compensate\npeople on the basis of their\n contributions.[5]\n That is, when it comes to the distribution of income (and thus\nwealth, being merely a stock of unspent income), \u201cmerit\u201d\nshould be interpreted as economic contribution. (For discussion of the\nmatters arising in this section, see Dekker 2010, Hsieh 2000, Mankiw\n2010, David Miller 1989 and 1999, Mulligan 2018b, Riley 1989, Sheffrin\n2013, Von Platz 2022, and Weinstein 2011.)\n\nImagine a garden which produces a harvest (the \u201coutput\u201d)\nas a result of citizens\u2019 contributions to it\u2014seeding,\nwatering, weeding, fertilizing, and so on (\u201cinputs\u201d). The\nmeritocrat holds that each citizen deserves a share of the harvest\nproportional to her contribution to it. If Lane contributes twice as\nmuch during the growing season as Rory, then Lane deserves twice as\nmuch in return. (This is, again, Aristotle\u2019s notion of\nproportional equality.)\n\nBefore we examine this metaphor\u2014its complexities and whether it\nis apposite in the first place\u2014it is worth noting that this\ndistributive principle is idiosyncratic, politically. To many, the\nidea that people who contribute more should be paid more, an obviously\ninegalitarian idea, sounds conservative. And it has been defended by\nconservatives (e.g., Mankiw [2013]).\n\nYet this is at the very same time the rule favored by Marx (in\n\u201cCritique of the Gotha Program\u201d) for his penultimate,\nsocialist phase of history. This is, in part, why it is fair to say\nthat \u201cMarx is more a meritocrat than Rawls, Nielsen, Dworkin,\nand most contemporary liberal political philosophers\u201d (Pojman\n1999: 93).\n\nAn obvious question for this distributive view is how to interpret\n\u201ccontribution\u201d. For some scholars, the proper index is\nwillingness-to-pay (WTP)\u2014the maximum price a person\nwill pay for some good or service. Thus, if a person P\nproduces X, by aggregating the WTP for X across\nconsumers we obtain a measure of P\u2019s contribution.\n\nA slightly different interpretation relies on the concept of\nconsumer surplus. Observe that if a consumer pays exactly her\nWTP for X, in a sense she has received no benefit. For at\nthat price she is, by definition, indifferent between buying\nX and saving her money. Whereas, if there is a large\ndifference between her WTP and X\u2019s price, then her\nwelfare (as measured in dollars) increases when she buys\n X.[6]\n That increase is the consumer surplus.\n\nThe typical person\u2019s WTP for a diamond ring is high and WTP for\na jug of water is low. But plausibly the producer of the latter\ncontributes more than the producer of the former.\n\nStandard (neoclassical) economic theory also provides an\ninterpretation of contribution, as marginal product. This is\nthe change in economic output a person\u2019s economic participation\ncreates, holding all else fixed. In simple models, this in fact is how\neconomies remunerate. In these models, compensation equals\ncontribution.\n\nStill, it is important that compensation be proportional to\ncontribution, since, in general, total output will not equal the sum\nof marginal products. (It\u2019s true only for the special case of\nconstant returns to scale.) But in all cases, proportional\ncompensation is possible.\n\nAll of these interpretations of \u201ccontribution\u201d rely on the\nstandard idea that economic value is subjective\u2014that\ngoods and services are valuable because, and only insofar as, they are\ndesired by consumers. That might be disputed. Perhaps producers of\nfirearms and social media make no contribution at all or indeed are\ndestructive. That possibility is not captured in any of the\naforementioned interpretations, and would require elaboration by a\nmeritocrat so inclined.\n\nAnother question is how to disentangle individuals\u2019\ncontributions from the collective economic effort. In particular,\npeople\u2019s contributions emanate not only from their labor, but\nfrom capital as well.\n\nSuppose a worker produces 100 widgets per day in a factory. On his\nown, the worker could produce nothing. Without workers, the factory\nwould sit idle. How many of those 100 widgets reflects the\nworker\u2019s contribution? How many reflect the contribution of the\ncapitalist who owns the factory?\n\nThis entanglement problem speaks to the essential role that\nequal opportunity plays in a meritocracy. If the capitalist inherited\nthe factory from his father, it is hard to see why he should be\nrewarded on meritocratic grounds. His contributions do not reflect\nhis merit. If, in contrast, the capitalist bought the factory\nhimself, with money he earned via his economic contributions,\nthat seems meritocratic.\n\nAn issue which has arisen in the literature, which is empirical rather\nthan philosophical, is how well actual economies approximate this\nmeritocratic ideal. One important way they do not is the presence of\neconomic rent (see Lamont 1997 and Mulligan 2018a).\n\nClassically, economic rents were payments for \u201cfree gifts of\nnature\u201d, like unimproved land. Imagine a wild orchard controlled\nby O, who charges people for the right to harvest it. That\nportion of O\u2019s income is economic rent. The orchard\nmakes its contribution\u2014bears fruit\u2014whether O\nreceives an income or not. This is obviously different from typical\ncompensation, which is necessary to bring factors of production into\nuse. If you want a person to make widgets, you have to pay him.\nEconomic rents are, thus, payments to a person unrelated to his\neconomic contribution. And unlike typical forms of income, economic\nrents can be taxed without loss of economic efficiency.\n\nIn contemporary economies, economic rents are diverse. They include\nincome that (i) executives receive by gaining control over their own\npay-setting (see, e.g., Bebchuk & Fried 2004); (ii) is obtained\nthrough luck (Bertrand & Mullainathan 2001); (iii) is connected to\nunproductive activity (think: hedge funds that exploit technical\ninefficiencies in markets, Bivens & Mishel 2013); and (iv)\nattractive people make because they are attractive\u2014the\nbeauty premium (Hamermesh & Biddle 1994).\n\nTypically, when economists and philosophers object to economic\nrent it is on the grounds that it is inefficient. For the\nmeritocrat, it is worse than that: It is unjust.\n\nThe most famous opponent of economic rent is Henry George, who states\nhis opposition in recognizably meritocratic terms:\n\n\nWhen all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community,\nthen will the equality ordained by nature be achieved. No citizen will\nhave an advantage over any other citizen save as is given by his\nindustry, skill, and intelligence; and each will obtain what he fairly\nearns. Then, but not till then, will labour get its full reward, and\ncapital its natural return. (1879: book VIII, chapter III, last\nparagraph)\n\n\nOne might wonder: Just how unequal would a meritocracy be? While the\nprecise distribution of jobs, income, and wealth will depend on the\nparticulars of the meritocratic theory, meritocracy would be\negalitarian by contemporary standards. Observe that, in a meritocracy,\ndifferences in merit may arise in only two ways: differences in\nnatural traits and differences in individual choice (about which\nskills to develop, what career to pursue, how much to work, etc.) (A\nmeritocrat could even hold that equal opportunity requires nullifying\ndifferences in natural\n traits\u2014\u00a72.3\u2014leaving\n individual choice as the sole source of inequality.)\n\nIn addition, in a meritocracy there is little to no inheritance of\nwealth. This is for the same reason that there is no inheritance of\nhereditary titles and their concomitant privileges: It violates equal\nopportunity. Inherited wealth also severs the critical connection\nbetween contribution and income. If one doesn\u2019t deserve some\nwealth\u2014which one doesn\u2019t, if it\u2019s\ninherited\u2014then one doesn\u2019t deserve the investment income\nit produces.\n\nFurther, the largest divergences between contribution and income are\nseen at the top of the distribution. Economic rents, for instance, are\nextracted by the very rich. Meritocratic policies to remedy the\nproblem of rent have the effect of redistributing wealth from the top\nof the distribution downward.\n",
