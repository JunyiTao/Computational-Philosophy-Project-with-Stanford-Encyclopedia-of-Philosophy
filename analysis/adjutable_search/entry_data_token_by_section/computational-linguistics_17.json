I'm on point, on task, on message and off drugs\u2026 I'm\nin the moment, on the edge, over the top and under the radar. A\nhigh-concept, low-profile, medium-range ballistic missionary.\u201d\n\u2013George Carlin\n(\u201cLife is worth losing\u201d, first broadcast on HBO, November\n5, 2005)\n\nWe have already commented on processing metonymy, which is\nconventionally counted as a figure of speech\u2014a word or phrase\nstanding for something other than its literal meaning. However, while\nmetonymy is essentially an abridging device, other figurative modes,\nsuch as metaphor, simile, idioms, irony, personification, or hyperbole\n(overstatement) convey meanings, especially connotative ones, not\neasily conveyed in other ways. We focus on metaphor here, as it is in\na sense a more general form of several other tropes. Moreover, it has\nreceived the most attention from computational linguists, because the\nargument can be made that metaphor pervades language, with no sharp\ndemarcation between literal and metaphorical usage (e.g., Wilks 1978;\nCarbonell 1980; Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Barnden 2006). For example,\nwhile \u201cThe temperature dropped\u201d can be viewed as involving\na sense of\ndrop that is synonymous with decrease, it can also\nbe viewed as a conventional metaphor comparing the decreasing\ntemperature to a falling object. As a way of allowing for examples of\nthis type, Wilks offered a processing paradigm in which selectional\nconstraints (such as a physical-object constraint on the subject\nof drop) are treated as mere preferences rather than firm\nrequirements.\nHowever, processing metaphor requires more than relaxation of\npreferences; it is both context-dependent and profoundly\nknowledge-dependent. For example,\n\n(5.14) He threw in the towel\n\n\n\n\ncan be a literal description of a mundane act in a laundromat setting,\na literal description of a symbolic act by a boxer's handler, or a\nstock metaphor for conceding defeat in any difficult endeavor. But to\ngrasp the metaphorical meaning fully, including the connotation of a\npunishing, doomed struggle, requires a vivid conception of what a\nboxing match is like.\nIn approaching metaphor computationally, some authors, e.g., Dedre\nGentner (see Falkenhainer et al.\n1989), have viewed it as depending on\nshared properties and relational structure (while allowing for\ndiscordant ones), directly attached to the concepts being compared. For\nexample, in comparing an atom to the solar system, we observe a\nrevolves-around relation between electrons and the nucleus on\nthe one hand and between planets and the sun on the other. But others\nhave pointed out that the implicit comparison may hinge on properties\nreached only indirectly. In this view, finding a metaphor for a\nconcept is a process of moving away from the original concept in a\nknowledge network in a series of steps, each of which transforms some\ncurrent characteristic into a related one. This is the process termed\n\u201cslippage\u201d by Hofstadter et al.  (1995). Others (e.g.,\nMartin 1990, drawing on Lakoff and Johnson 1980) emphasize preexisting\nknowledge of conventional ways of bridging metaphorically from one\nconcept to another, such as casting a nonliving thing as a living\nthing.\nIn view of the dependence of metaphor on context and extensive\nknowledge, and the myriad difficulties still confronting all aspects\nof language understanding, it is not surprising that no general system\nfor processing metaphor in context exists, let alone for using\nmetaphor creatively. Still, Martin's MIDAS program was able to\ninterpret a variety of metaphors in the context of a language-based\nUnix adviser, relying on knowledge about the domain and about\nmetaphorical mapping, hand-coded in the KODIAK knowledge\nrepresentation language. Also, several other programs have\ndemonstrated a capacity to analyze or generate various examples of\nmetaphors, including the Structure Mapping Engine (SME) (Falkenhainer\net al.  1989), Met* (Fass 1991), ATT-Meta (Barnden 2001), KARMA\n(Narayanan 1997) and others. More recently, Veale and Hao (2008)\nundertook an empirical study of a slippage-based approach to metaphor,\nusing attributes collected from WordNet and the web. In a similar\nspirit, but taking SME as his inspiration, Turney (2008) implemented a\n\u201cLatent Relation Mapping Engine\u201d (LRME) to find the best\nmapping between the elements of two potentially comparable\ndescriptions (of equal size); the idea is to use web-based\nco-occurrence statistics to gauge not only the attribute similarity of\nany two given concepts (such as electron and planet)\nbut also the relational similarity of any two given pairs of concepts\n(such as electron:nucleus and planet:sun), using\nthese as metrics in optimizing the mapping.\n",
