    "main_text": "Three-self Theories\n2. Three-self Theories\n\nOne-self Trinity theories are motivated in part by the concern that if\nthere are three divine selves, this implies that there are three gods.\nThree-self theories, in various ways, deny this implication. They hold\nthe Persons of the Trinity to be selves (as defined above, section\n 1.1).\n A major motivation here is that the New Testament writings seem to\nassume that the Father and Son (and, some also argue, the Holy Spirit)\nare different selves (e.g. Layman 2016, 131\u20132).\n",
