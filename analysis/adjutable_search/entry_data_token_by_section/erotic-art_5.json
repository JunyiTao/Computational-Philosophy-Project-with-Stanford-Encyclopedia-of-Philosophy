    "main_text": "Modern Aesthetics and the Problem of Erotic Art || The Aesthetic Rehabilitation of the Erotic\n2.3 The Aesthetic Rehabilitation of the Erotic\n\nModern aesthetics and its 20th century formalist and\nexperientialist heirs have been criticized from many sides. But\ninstead of offering a general critique, let us consider briefly some\nof the philosophers who, in attacking modern aesthetics, have\nexplicitly pleaded for the inclusion of the sexual within the domain\nof aesthetics.\n\nOne of the most vehement early critics was Friedrich Nietzsche. In an\noft-quoted passage in On the Genealogy of Morals (1887:\nIII.6) Nietzsche shifts attention to the artist\u2019s point of view\nto reveal a fundamental flaw in modern aesthetics:\n\n\nWhen our aestheticians tirelessly rehearse, in support of Kant\u2019s\nview, that the spell of beauty enables us to view even nude female\nstatues \u201cdisinterestedly\u201d we may be allowed to laugh a\nlittle at their expense. The experiences of artists in this delicate\nmatter are rather more \u201cinteresting\u201d; certainly Pygmalion\nwas not entirely devoid of aesthetic feeling.\n\n\n(NB: For Nietzsche\u2019s texts we have relied on the classic edition\nof Colli & Montinari, 1967\u201378. On the Genealogy of\nMorals is abbreviated as GM, The Will to Power is\nabbreviated as WP, and Twilight of the Idols is abbreviated\nas TI. The translations we have used are listed in the\nbibliography)\n\nPygmalion fell under the spell of the beautiful statue he had created,\nbut his enjoyment was certainly not bereft of any desire. For\nNietzsche, the case of Pygmalion is not exceptional, but rather\nemblematic: \u201cAll art works tonically, increases strength,\ninflames desire\u201d (WP \u00a7809). And, as he writes in\nTwilight of the Idols (1889),\n\n\nall beauty incites to procreation\u2014\u2026 precisely this is the\nproprium of its effect, from the most sensual regions up into\nthe most spiritual\u2026. (TI IX.22)\n\n\nTo believe, as Schopenhauer, Kant, Shaftesbury seem to have done, that\nin matters of beauty and art there is such a thing as\n\u201cimmaculate perception\u201d (an aesthetic regard pure of any\ndesire), is simply to deceive oneself.\n\nFar from building a wall between the aesthetic and the sexual,\nNietzsche sees them as intimately linked: \u201cThe demand for art\nand beauty is an indirect demand for the ecstasies of sexuality\u201d\n(WP \u00a7805). The two experiences really share the same structure\nand phenomenology. As with sexual experience, if there is to be\n\u201cany aesthetic doing or seeing, one physiological condition is\nindispensable: rapture\u201d (TI IX, 8). And the pleasure that one\nreceives is not a disembodied, cognitive pleasure\u2014a unique kind\nof experience that would set us apart from animals. No,\n\n\nart reminds (us) of states of animal vigour: it is on the one hand an\nexcess and overflow of blooming corporeality into the world\nof images and desires: on the other, an excitation of the animal\nfunctions through the images and desires of intensified life. (WP\n\u00a7802)\n\n\nThus, while the erotic masterpieces of the past must qualify as\nregrettable anomalies for someone like Schopenhauer, Nietzsche has no\ntrouble at all in giving them a place.\n\nWithin contemporary aesthetics, Alexander Nehamas and Richard\nShusterman have made a serious and sustained effort to make room for\nthe erotic within aesthetics and art. In the first few pages of his\nbook Only a Promise of Happiness (2007), Nehamas lays his\ncards on the table. Mentioning Kant and Schopenhauer as his\nadversaries, he states uncompromisingly that \u201cthe only reaction\nappropriate to beauty is eros\u2014love, the desire to\npossess it\u201d (2007: 6). While eros should not\nnecessarily be understood in a sexual sense here, Nehamas does think\nthat erotic encounters provide an instructive model for aesthetic\nexperiences in general:\n\n\nThe most abstract and intellectual beauty provokes the urge to possess\nit no less than the most sensual inspires the passion to come to know\nit better. (2007: 7)\n\n\nEach judgment of beauty is future oriented, is identical with the\nspark of desire, and contains, in the words of Stendhal, a promise of\nhappiness (Stendhal 1926: 74; Nehamas 2007: 55).\n\nFor Nehamas, too, erotic art is not at all a recalcitrant exception in\nneed of explanation. Quite the contrary, it offers the best possible\ninroad to understanding what beauty and art are all about. It\u2019s\nnot a coincidence that the touchstone work of art, to which Nehamas\nreturns again and again, is Manet\u2019s Olympia. Far from\nbeing an exercise in formal beauty, as Zola would have it, this is a\npainting that is precisely designed\n\n\nto jolt the audience, especially the men, into acknowledging that what\nthey were enjoying was not a painted canvas or an idealized figure\nwith an edifying message but a naked woman of their own place and\ntime. (Nehamas 2007: 27)\n\n\nIt is erotic in every sense of the word and for Nehamas it does what\nall great art should do: spark the audience\u2019s desire.\n\nIf Nehamas mainly takes issue with the disavowal of desire within\nmodern aesthetics, Richard Shusterman\u2019s main target is the\n\u201cidealist-rationalist repugnance for the body\u201d which he\nfinds is permeating the entire tradition of Western philosophy (2005:\n324; see also Irvin (ed.) 2016). To counter this, Shusterman proposes\na new discipline, \u201csomaesthetics,\u201d which aims to study the\n\u201cexperience and use of one\u2019s body as a locus of\nsensory-aesthetic appreciation and creative self-fashioning\u201d\n(1999: 302) and which has as one of its main subsidiary ambitions to\n\u201c(i)mprove our appreciation of the artistry, beauty, meaning\nthat sexual experience can offer\u201d (2008: 85). In several of his\nessays he argues that sexual experience itself can qualify as an\naesthetic experience, since most of the crucial features attributed to\naesthetic experiences are also attributable to erotic experiences:\nthey are pursued and valued for their own sake, they are rich in\nintensity and stand out distinctively from the flow of ordinary\nhumdrum experience, they display harmonies of structure and developing\nform, they are being subjectively savored but also intentionally\ndirected at an object, they deeply engage thought, feeling, and\nimagination, and stimulate both body and mind (2007: 57, 2008: 93).\nHence, instead of ignoring or disenfranchising the tradition of erotic\nart, Shusterman pleads for the reassertion of an \u201cars\nerotica\u201d which would not just involve a renewed attention for\ncertain works of the past, but would entail the development of genuine\nerotic art forms that could help increase our understanding of the\nrelation between aesthetics and sex, deliver aesthetically rewarding\nerotic experiences, and deepen our appreciation of the aesthetic\npotential of other somatic practices (2007: 57; 2021).\n",
