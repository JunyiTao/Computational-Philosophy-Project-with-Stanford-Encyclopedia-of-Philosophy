    "main_text": "Socrates and Plato || Socrates\u2019 Trial: The Political Philosophy of Citizenship\n3.2 Socrates\u2019 Trial: The Political Philosophy of Citizenship\n\nThat engagement with political philosophy was dramatically intensified\nwhen Socrates was, at the age of seventy, arraigned, tried, and\nsentenced to death by an Athenian popular jury. In a prosecution\nbrought by a group of his fellow citizens who claimed to be\nshouldering that burden for the sake of the city (the usual way in\nwhich prosecutions were brought in Athens), the charges laid were\nagainst him were three-fold: not acknowledging the city\u2019s gods;\nintroducing new gods; and corrupting the young (Apol. 24b).\nEach of these had a political dimension, given the civic control of\ncentral religious cults mentioned earlier, and the broad political\nimportance of educating the young to take their place in the civic\norder. Timed a few years after the overthrow of a short-lived\noligarchic regime (known as that of \u201cThe Thirty\u201d) which\nhad been led by several of Socrates\u2019 sometime associates Critias\nand Charmides (their oligarchic regime having been imposed after the\nignominious Athenian defeat in the war with Sparta which had earlier\nseen another associate of Socrates (Alcibiades) turn traitor to\nAthens), the trial must be suspected of having served as a substitute\nfor the prohibited political trials of the oligarchic partisans (such\ntrials having been generally barred by an amnesty passed in 403 BCE by\nthe restored democracy; see Cartledge 2009, Ch.7, Carawan 2013, Shear\n2011).\n\nSocrates\u2019 speeches in the court trial\u2014literary versions of\nwhich were produced by Plato, Xenophon, and a number of other\nfollowers\u2014forced him to confront directly the question of his\nrole in an Athens defined by its democratic institutions and norms.\nSocrates had played his part as an ordinary citizen, allowing his name\nto go forward for selection by lot to serve on the Council, and\nserving in the army when required. But he had not engaged actively in\n\u201cpublic affairs\u201d (ta pragmata, Apol.\n32e): he had not spoken in the Assembly (31c), nor, so far as we know,\nbrought any prosecutions in the law-courts. In Plato\u2019s account,\nafter countering the religious accusations, Socrates acknowledged this\nabstention from public affairs but claimed to have had a more\nsignificant mission laid on him by the god Apollo when his oracle at\nDelphi declared that no man was wiser than Socrates: his mission was\nto stir up the city like a gadfly (30e), discussing virtue and related\nmatters (38a), and benefiting each person by \u201ctrying to persuade\nhim\u201d to care for virtue rather than wealth for himself and for\nthe city (36c\u2013d). He went so far as to claim that as a civic\nbenefactor, he deserved not death but the lifelong publicly provided\nmeals commonly awarded to an Olympic champion (36e\u201337a).\nSocrates here depicts himself as a new kind of citizen,\nconceptualizing the public good in a new way and so serving it best\nthrough unprecedented actions, in contrast to the conventionally\ndefined paths of political contest and success (Villa 2001).\n\nWhile depicting himself in his defense speeches in Plato\u2019s\nApology as a new kind of virtuous citizen, Socrates makes\nthree remarks which have in modern times been seized upon as\nindications of the principled limits which he might have put on the\nrequirement to obey the law. The first two recalled political\nincidents: while serving on the Council, he had voted against an\nillegal proposal (32b\u2013c); and under the brief oligarchical\ndomination of \u201cThe Thirty\u201d, he had disobeyed an order of\nthe ruling body to arrest a democratic partisan for execution\n(32c\u2013d). The third is a hypothetical remark. If, he imagines,\nthe jurors were to say to him, \u201cwe acquit you, but only on\ncondition that you spend no more time on this investigation and do not\npractice philosophy, and if you are caught doing so you will\ndie,\u201d his reply would be: \u201cI will obey the god rather than\nyou, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to\npractice philosophy\u201d (both quotations excerpted from longer\nsentences, 29c\u2013d). Particularly in twentieth-century Anglophone\nscholarship, these remarks have engendered a view of Socrates as\nendorsing civil disobedience in certain circumstances, and so have\nframed the question of civil disobedience and the grounds for\npolitical obligation as arising in Plato. A significant debate on\nthese matters took shape in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s\nat the time of widespread civil disobedience relating to civil rights\nand the Vietnam War: see for example Konvitz 1964, Woozley 1972.\n\nThat debate has had to confront the fact that Socrates did not\nactually disobey his own death sentence with which his trial\nconcluded: when the time came, he drank the poisonous hemlock as\nprescribed by the jury. Before that moment, Plato imagines Socrates\nbeing visited in prison by his friend Crito (in a dialogue which bears\nthe latter\u2019s name), and urged to escape for the sake of his\nfriends and family, a practice which was frequently tolerated in\nAthens so long as the escapee fled into exile. Socrates is not\npersuaded by Crito\u2019s arguments. He begins his examination of\nthem by recalling principles to which he and Crito had in the past\nagreed, including the principle that it is better to suffer injustice\nthan to commit it (Cri. 47a\u201350a). He then goes on to\nventriloquize a series of speeches against escape, which he ascribes\nto the \u201cLaws of\n Athens\u201d.[6]\n These speeches articulate a set of special connections between\nSocrates and the Laws of Athens which, depending on one\u2019s\nreading, either flesh out the principle that it is better to suffer\ninjustice than to do it (by dramatizing reasons for which it would\nunjust for Socrates to escape), or else stand in tension with it by\ninvoking absolutist grounds with implications more extensive than such\na principle would authorize (Harte 1999). On any reading, it is\nimportant to bear in mind that Socrates is choosing to obey a jury\nverdict that has commanded him to suffer what is arguably an\ninjustice, but not to commit one, so that one of his fundamental\nethical principles here as elsewhere in Plato (that it is better to\nsuffer an injustice than to commit one) is at least compatible with\nhis acceptance of the jury\u2019s sentence.\n\nThe \u201cLaws of Athens\u201d appeal to a kind of social contract\nmade between themselves and Socrates. The contract is unequal: the\n\u201cLaws\u201d compare themselves to parents and slaveowners, and\nSocrates to child and slave. Obedience to them is owed, they claim,\nbecause the \u201cLaws\u201d have provided the whole basis for\nSocrates\u2019 education and life in the city, a city in which he has\nnotably chosen to remain, never traveling abroad except on military\nservice. But the \u201cLaws\u201d also speak of the opportunity they\nafford to Socrates to \u201cpersuade or obey\u201d them (51b;\n51e\u201352a). The meaning of this clause and its relevance to civil\ndisobedience is again much debated (Kraut 1984 remains a landmark).\nNevertheless, the image of Socrates tried, convicted, and made to die\n(by his own hand) at the city\u2019s command has come to be a vivid\nand powerful symbol of tension in the relationship between political\nphilosophy and political authority.\n",
