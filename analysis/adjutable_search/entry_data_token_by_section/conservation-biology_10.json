    "main_text": "What Are the Aims of Conservation Biology? || Inductive Risk and Value-Ladenness\n3.1 Inductive Risk and Value-Ladenness\n\nScientific decision-making involves values. Some however have argued\nthat the values present are merely epistemic values (Laudan 1986). For\nexample, Thomas Kuhn argued that scientific theories are evaluated in\nterms of accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness\n(Kuhn 1977). Moreover, he construed these as values because they are\nso vague as to require interpretation and they are many and thus\nrequire weighting. If they were merely methodological rules, then\nthese would not be problems. Nevertheless, they appear to be\nepistemic. Conservation biology serves as an interesting case because\nit appears that moral and sociopolitical values are to be found at its\ncore (Longino 1990). That is, they are not only epistemic.\n\nLet consider an argument from inductive risk (Douglas 2000; Hempel\n1965; Rudner 1953, and in the context of conservation biology see\nShrader-Frechette & McCoy 1993: Ch. 6). In standard Neyman-Pearson\nhypothesis testing we formulate a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) and an\nalternate \\(H_1\\) (Gotelli & Ellison 2013). The null states that,\n\u201c\\(C\\) does not have an effect \\(E\\)\u201d. The alternate is\nthe negation, which states that \u201c\\(C\\) has an effect\n\\(E\\)\u201d. Thus there are two relevant probabilities of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is true\n\\(H_0\\) is false \n\nAccept \\(H_0\\)\nCorrect\nType II error \n\nReject \\(H_0\\)\nType I error\nCorrect  \n\n\nTable 1: Type I and Type II errors\n\n\nWe can also represent them as, \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr(\\text{Rejecting } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\text{ is true}) &= \\alpha\\\\\n\\Pr(\\text{Accepting } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\text{ is false}) &= \\beta\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nSuppose we have the following null and alternate hypotheses (Noon and McKelvey 1996, Noon and Blakesley 2006).\n\n\n\\(H_0\\): Logging old growth forest will not reduce northern spotted\nowl populations\n\n\\(H_1\\): Logging old growth forest will reduce northern spotted owl\npopulations\n\n\nThus there are two errors again. We reject \\(H_0\\) and log old growth\nforests will not reduce northern spotted owl populations. We accept\n\\(H_0\\) and logging old growth forests will reduce northern spotted\nowl populations. For mathematical reasons, we cannot minimize both\nType I and Type II errors, and thus we must minimize \\(\\alpha\\) or\n\\(\\beta\\). By custom, scientists attempt to minimize Type I errors;\nthat is,\n\n\nReject \\(H_0\\) if, and only if, \\(\\Pr(\\text{Rejecting } H_0 \\mid H_0\n\\text{ is true}) \\lt 0.05\\)\n\n\nHowever, this requires that we evaluate which would be\nworse\u2014allowing logging though it reduces the owl population or\nnot allowing logging though it would not have reduced them anyway?\nThat is, we have a moral or sociopolitical question. Given habitat\nprotection affects both the owls and the livelihoods of loggers living\nin the Pacific Northwest, this is not merely a technical scientific\nquestion. Some have argued that when environmental harms are at stake,\nwe should minimize Type II errors (Shrader-Frechette & McCoy\n1993). This mode of reasoning is sometimes called the\n\u201cprecautionary principle\u201d (Steel 2015).\n\nNeyman-Pearson statistical hypothesis testing is a very common\nmethodology taught in statistics courses and used by practicing\nbiologists. However, some philosophers and statisticians reject it for\nan alternative, Bayesianism (Howson & Urbach 2006). According to\nBayesianism, we neither accept nor reject hypotheses (though one can\nwork out a notion of acceptance in the framework (see Levi 1974; Maher\n1993)). Rather, we compare the probability of hypothesis with regard\nto some evidence and determine how it affects its probability (see\nentry on\n philosophy of statistics).\n Whether the problem of inductive risk disappears in a Bayesian\ninferential frameworks is an interesting question. Insofar as\ncredences (i.e., subjective degrees of belief) are affected by\nattitudes towards risk, then arguably the problem arises in a\ndifferent guise.\n\nWhether one finds the argument from inductive risk persuasive, it is\nclear that ethical and sociopolitical values are brought into the\nscience itself by various scientists (see entry on\n scientific objectivity).\n Conservation biologists such as Paul Ehrlich, E. O. Wilson, Thomas\nLovejoy, etc. often advocated ethical values as scientists in order to\nraise awareness regarding ecological degradation and its effects on\nspecies including our own (Takacs 1996). Supposing that there are\nepistemic and moral values in conservation biology, what are the\nspecific ones present? One way to taxonomize those values is through\nHelen Longino\u2019s work (Longino 1990) (see entry on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science).\n She draws a distinction between constitutive and\ncontextual values in science. Constitutive values are those\nthat are essential to the scientific inquiry. For example, if Kuhn is\ncorrect that accuracy, simplicity, and scope are values and they are\nessential to scientific methodology, then these would be constitutive\nvalues. You simply cannot do science without them. Contextual values\nare those that are accidental to science; they come from the personal,\nsocial, and cultural context in which science occurs. It worth noting\nthe epistemic/non-epistemic values distinction is related to but\ndistinct from the constitutive/contextual value distinction. For\nexample, one might argue honesty is a constitutive ethical value of\nscientific inquiry (Pennock 2019). Likewise, one might argue that\ncertain scientists have differing contextual epistemic commitments\n(Segerstr\u00e5le 2000). \n\nSome of these contextual values arise from individuals because of\ntheir own commitments. E. O. Wilson has written a great deal arguing\nthat we should work against anthropogenic species extinction for\nexample (Wilson 1992). Group contextual values include \ncodes of ethics. For example, the Society for Conservation Biology has\na Code of Ethics (see the Other Internet Resources). It includes\nobligations like,\n\n\nActively disseminate information to promote understanding of and\nappreciation for biodiversity and the science of conservation biology.\n\nRecognize that uncertainty is inherent in managing ecosystems and\nspecies and encourage application of the precautionary principle in\nmanagement and policy decisions affecting biodiversity.\n\n\nThough one might argue about specific obligations included in the Code\nof Ethics, generally we the public agrees that one should act with\nintegrity in one\u2019s research and treat non-human animals with\nrespect. Still, there are more controversial societal values that play\na part in conservation biology. Conservation biologist Reed Noss\nwrites,\n\n\nConservation biology has been described throughout its history as\n\u201cvalue-laden\u201d, \u201cmission-oriented\u201d,\n\u201cnormative\u201d, and sometimes in less flattering terms. The\nentire field rests on the value assumption that biodiversity is good\nand ought to be conserved. Human actions that protect and restore\nbiodiversity are good; those that destroy or degrade biodiversity are\nbad. (Noss 2007: 18)\n\n\nRecently, many human lives have been lost to the virus Zaire\nebolavirus in the genus Ebolavirus. To exterminate this\nvirus or the genus one might argue is not morally wrong but morally\npermissible if not obligatory. Noss\u2019 claim is that this is\nmorally wrong, which many would find controversial.\n\nConsider the claim that biodiversity has intrinsic value (see entry on\n environmental ethics).\n Should conservation biologists accept this? Michael Soul\u00e9\nfamously claimed that conservation biology included a variety of\n\u201cnormative postulates\u201d including: diversity of organisms\nis good, ecological complexity is good, evolution is good, and biotic\ndiversity has intrinsic value (Soul\u00e9 1985: 730\u20131). He\nwrites,\n\n\nThis normative postulate is the most fundamental. In emphasizing the\ninherent value of nonhuman life, it distinguishes the dualistic,\nexploitive world view from a more unitary perspective: Species have\nvalue in themselves. a value neither conferred nor revocable, but\nspringing from a species\u2019 long evolutionary heritage and\npotential or even from the mere fact of its existence. (Soul\u00e9\n1985: 731)\n\n\nFirst, what does it mean to say biodiversity has intrinsic value\n(Vucetich, Bruskotter, & Nelson 2015)? Ethicists debate what is\nintrinsic value and what might have it (O\u2019Neill 1992). Some\nargue that intrinsic value is the value something has in virtue of its\nintrinsic properties (Moore 1903) A property is intrinsic roughly if\nit is had by something independent of other objects (see entry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties).\n However, many properties that make species valuable include ones like\nbeauty and rarity which are arguably extrinsic (Russow 1981). Other\nphilosophers argue that intrinsic value is what we value for its own\nsake (Ewing 1947; Lewis 1989). What is special about intrinsic value\nis how something is valued not the properties of thing so valued. But\nthis is says nothing about what the attitude of valuing is and it\nraises other difficult questions. Some think intrinsic value does not\ndepend on valuers whatsoever. But this appears to assume a strong form\nof moral realism about value, which some metaethicists would deny\n(Blackburn 1993; Gibbard 1992).\n\nSecond, conservation biologists themselves do not agree on the matter.\nHere are representative quotations from conservation biologists on the\nsubject (as quoted in Takacs 1996: 249\u2013252):\n\n\nDavid Ehrenfeld: \u201cFor biological diversity, value is.\nNothing more and nothing less\u2026. Well, I couldn\u2019t prove\nit, I guess. I just believe it.\u201d\n\nPaul Ehrlich: \u201c\u2026 I just can\u2019t have the feeling that\nthe only value they [species] might have is what they might mean to\nus. But you can\u2019t possibly defend that\nscientifically\u201d.\n\nJerry Franklin: \u201cOh, I basically think so, yes. But I\nhaven\u2019t given a whole lot of thought to it\u201d.\n\nDaniel Janzen: \u201cThe word value is anthropocentric\u2026.\nThat\u2019s a contradiction in terms\u201d.\n\nS. J. MacNaughton: \u201cI don\u2019t see how anything can have\nvalue outside of a value that human beings place on it, because value\nis really something uniquely human, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nDavid Pimmentel: \u201c[I]n trying to protect or conserve nature, to\nuse the argument of intrinsic value gets you\u2014well, I don\u2019t\nthink it sells very well\u201d.\n\n\nIf prominent conservation biologists disagree whether biodiversity has\nintrinsic value and what it means to claim it, one might ask how it\ncould be axiomatic in the first place.\n",
