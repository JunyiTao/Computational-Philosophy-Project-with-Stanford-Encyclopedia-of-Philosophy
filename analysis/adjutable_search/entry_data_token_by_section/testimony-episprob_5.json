    "main_text": "Knowledge Transmission and Generation || The Transmission View\n2.1 The Transmission View\n\nAccording to the Transmission View, testimonial knowledge can only be\ntransmitted from a speaker to a hearer. Here is one (but not the only)\nway of formulating this view in terms of necessity and\nsufficiency:\n\n\nTV-S: For every speaker, A, and hearer,\nB, if\n\nA knows that p,\nB comes to believe that p on the basis of\nA\u2019s testimony and\nB has no undefeated defeaters for believing that p,\nthen B comes to know that p too.\n\n\n(See Austin 1946 [1979]; Welbourne 1979, 1981, 1986, 1994; Evans 1982;\nE. Fricker 1987; Coady 1992; McDowell 1994; Adler 1996, 2002; Owens\n2000, 2006; Burge 1993; Williamson 1996, 2000; and Audi 1997).\n\nTV-N: For every speaker, A, and hearer,\nB, B knows that p on the basis of\nA\u2019s testimony only if A knows that p\ntoo.\n\n(See Welbourne 1979, 1981, 1986, 1994; Hardwig 1985, 1991; A. Ross\n1986; Burge 1993, 1997; Plantinga 1993; Williamson 1996, 2000; Audi\n1997, 1998, 2006; Owens 2000, 2006; Reynolds 2002; Adler 2002;\nFaulkner 2006; Schmitt 2006).\n\n\nOne of the main motivations for the Transmission View comes from an\nalleged analogy between testimony and memory: Just as I cannot acquire\nmemorial knowledge that p today if I did not know that p\nat some earlier point in time, I cannot acquire testimonial knowledge\nthat p from you today if you do not know that p\nyourself. (But see Barnett 2015 for a recent discussion of the\nimportant differences between memory and testimony, and see Lackey\n2005b for why memory can generate knowledge.)\n\nDespite the intuitive and theoretical appeal, the Transmission View\nhas challenged in a variety of ways.\n",
