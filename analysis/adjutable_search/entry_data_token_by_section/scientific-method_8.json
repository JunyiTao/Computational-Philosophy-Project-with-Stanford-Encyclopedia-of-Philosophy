    "main_text": "Discourse on scientific method\n6. Discourse on scientific method\n\nDespite philosophical disagreements, the idea of the\nscientific method still figures prominently in contemporary discourse\non many different topics, both within science and in society at large.\nOften, reference to scientific method is used in ways that convey\neither the legend of a single, universal method characteristic of all\nscience, or grants to a particular method or set of methods privilege\nas a special \u2018gold standard\u2019, often with reference to\nparticular philosophers to vindicate the claims. Discourse on\nscientific method also typically arises when there is a need to\ndistinguish between science and other activities, or for justifying\nthe special status conveyed to science. In these areas, the\nphilosophical attempts at identifying a set of methods characteristic\nfor scientific endeavors are closely related to the philosophy of\nscience\u2019s classical problem of demarcation (see the entry on\n science and pseudo-science)\n and to the philosophical analysis of the social dimension of\nscientific knowledge and the role of science in democratic\nsociety.\n",
