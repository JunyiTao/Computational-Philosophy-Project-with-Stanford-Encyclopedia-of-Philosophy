    "main_text": "The Shape of the Traditional Pornography Debate || The Traditional Liberal Defense of a Right to Pornography\n2.2 The Traditional Liberal Defense of a Right to Pornography\n\nTraditional liberal defenders of pornography famously disagree,\nrejecting both the principle of legal moralism and the principle of\nlegal paternalism, at least where consenting adults are concerned. This\nis not to say that liberal defenders of pornography necessarily approve\nof it. Indeed, they frequently personally dislike and disapprove of\npornography \u2013 especially violent and degrading pornography. Many concede\nthat pornography \u2013 by which they usually mean sexually explicit material\nwhose primary function is to produce sexual arousal in viewers \u2013 is\n\u201clow value\u201d speech: speech that contributes little, if\nanything, of intellectual, artistic, literary or political merit to the\nmoral and social environment. But this does not mean that it should not\nbe protected \u2013 quite the opposite. A vital principle is at stake for\nliberals in the debate over pornography and censorship. The principle\nis that mentally competent adults must not be prevented from expressing\ntheir own convictions, or from indulging their own private tastes,\nsimply on the grounds that, in the opinion of others, those convictions\nor tastes are mistaken, offensive or unworthy. Moral majorities must\nnot be allowed to use the law to suppress dissenting minority opinions\nor to force their own moral convictions on others. The underlying\nliberal sentiment here is nicely captured in the famous adage (often\nattributed to the French philosopher, Voltaire): \u201cI disapprove of\nwhat you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say\nit.\u201d[1]\n\nFor liberals, there is a very strong presumption in favor of\nindividual freedom and against state regulation that interferes with\nthat freedom. The only ground that liberals typically regard\nas providing a legitimate reason for state restrictions on individual\nfreedom is in order to prevent harm to others. Hence, in\ndebates over censorship and other forms of state regulation that\nrestrict the liberty of individuals against their will, the burden of\nproof is always firmly on those who argue for censorship to demonstrate\nthat the speech or conduct in question causes significant harm to\nindividuals other than those consenting adults directly involved in its\nproduction and use. It must either be shown to directly cause actual\nphysical violence to others (e.g., murder, rape, assault,\nbattery), on a narrower understanding of \u201charm\u201d; or to\ndeliberately or negligently violate sufficiently important\ninterests or rights of others, on a broader,\ninterest-based conception of \u201charm\u201d. (For further\ndiscussion of these different conceptions of harm to others, see\nDyzenhaus 1992; Feinberg 1987.)\n\nLiberals have traditionally defended a right to pornography on three\nmain grounds. (The \u201cright to pornography\u201d here, and in what\nfollows, means the negative right of consenting adults not to be\nprevented from making, publishing, exhibiting, distributing and\nconsuming pornography in private). The first ground is freedom of\nspeech or expression, which protects the freedom of individuals\n(in this case, pornographers) to express their opinions and to\ncommunicate those opinions to others, however mistaken, disagreeable or\noffensive others may find \nthem.[2]\nLiberals have tended to conceive of freedom,\nincluding freedom of expression, as negative freedom \u2013 as\nnon-interference by others \u2013 rather than as positive freedom, which\ninvolves having the positive goods and facilities required to exercise\nthe freedom.[3]\nFreedom is thus something that individuals\nhave just so long as there are no coercive external obstacles \u2013 notably,\nphysical or legal restrictions \u2013 in their way.\n\nFew liberals nowadays think that the (negative) right to freedom of\nspeech is an absolute right: a freedom that can never legitimately be\nrestricted by the state. If the speech causes sufficiently great harm\nto others, then the state may have a legitimate interest in regulating\nor preventing it. There is no simple general formula or algorithm for\ndetermining when the harm caused to others is \u201csufficiently\ngreat\u201d to justify legal restrictions in the case of speech and\nmore generally. This will depend on the outcome of a complex process of\ncarefully weighing and balancing the strength and nature of the harm\nand the competing interests at stake, and an analysis of the costs and\nbenefits of alternative policies, that needs to be undertaken on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n\nHowever, when it comes to legislation that interferes with free\nspeech, the liberal presumption against legislation is especially high.\nFor liberals take freedom of expression to be an especially important\nright that takes precedence over most other rights and interests\n(including equality) should they ever conflict. Levels of harm that\nwould normally be sufficient to justify regulating the conduct which\ncauses them may not be sufficiently great to justify restrictions in\ncases where the harm is caused by speech or expression. Hence, for\nliberals, justifying censorship of pornography requires that there is\nextremely reliable evidence to show that the publication or voluntary\nprivate consumption of pornography by consenting adults causes\nespecially great and serious harm to others. The harm caused\nby expression must be very certain and very great before it is\nlegitimate for a state to prohibit it. We would be justified in banning\na certain type of pornography (e.g., positive rape depictions) only\nwhen we are very sure that, on average, tokens of that type (i.e., most\nparticular positive rape depictions) cause very great harm.\n\nThis traditional free speech defense assumes (generally without much\nargument) that pornography is a form of speech or expression, in the\nsense of \u2018speech\u2019 relevant to a free speech principle. However, this\nassumption has been questioned. Frederick Schauer (1982) argues that a\nfree speech principle is designed to cover only acts of mental\ncommunication. \u201cHardcore\u201d pornography, however, is not\nprimarily in the business of mental communication: Its primary function\nis not to communicate ideas, but rather to arouse audiences sexually.\nIn this respect, it is more akin to a mechanical sex toy than a\npolitical pamphlet. If so, then just as production and use of sex toys\ncannot be defended on free speech grounds, so there is no free speech\ndefense of hardcore pornography since hardcore pornography is not\n\u201cspeech\u201d in the relevant sense. If this line of argument is\ncorrect, legal restrictions on production and consumption of\npornography should not be seen as raising any free speech concerns\nwhatsoever.\n\nSecondly, liberals have defended a right to pornography on the\ngrounds of a right to privacy (or \u201cmoral\nindependence,\u201d as one prominent liberal defender of pornography,\nRonald Dworkin [1985], calls it), which protects a sphere of private\nactivity within which individuals can explore and indulge their own\npersonal tastes and convictions, free from the threat of coercive\npressure or interference by the state and other individuals. Andrew\nAltman (2018) defends a right to pornography as part of a right to\nsexual autonomy. The specter of state intrusion into the private lives\nof individuals underpins much of the liberal discomfort about\ncensorship of pornography.\n\nLike the right to freedom of speech, the liberal commitment to\nprivacy is not absolute. It can be overridden if the private activities\nof individuals are such as to cause significant harm to others. Thus,\nif there is reliable evidence to suggest that the voluntary private\nconsumption of pornography causes sufficiently great harm to others\nthen \u2013 provided that this harm is sufficiently great and that state\nprohibitions are the only effective way of preventing it \u2013 the state\nwould have a legitimate interest in prohibiting it.\n\nBut \u2013 and this is the third prong of the traditional liberal\ndefense \u2013 pornography is comparatively harmless. Neither the\nexpression of pornographic opinions, nor the indulging of a private\ntaste for pornography, causes significant harm to others in the\nrelevant sense of \u201charm\u201d (i.e., crimes of physical violence\nor other significant, wrongful rights-violations). Hence, the\npublication and voluntary private consumption of pornography is none of\nthe state\u2019s business.\n2.2.1 The Harm Principle: When is the State Justified in Restricting Individual Liberty?\n\nThese three central ingredients in the liberal defense of\npornography find their classic expression in a famous and influential\npassage from John Stuart Mill\u2019s On Liberty (1859). In this\npassage, Mill sets out the principle that underpins the prevailing\nliberal view about when it is justified for the state to coercively\ninterfere with the liberty of its citizens. It is a principle that\ncontinues to provide the dominant liberal framework for the debate over\npornography and censorship. Mill writes:\n\n\nThe only principle for which power can be rightfully exercised over\nany member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent\nharm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a\nsufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear\nbecause it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him\nhappier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise or\neven right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or\nreasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for\ncompelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise.\nTo justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him,\nmust be calculated to produce evil to someone else. The only part of\nthe conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that\nwhich concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his\nindependence is, of right, absolute (Mill 1975, 15).\n\n\nMill\u2019s central claim is that society is justified in interfering\nwith the freedom of mentally competent adults to say and do what they\nwish only when their conduct will cause harm to others. This\nhas come to be known as the \u201charm principle\u201d; and it forms\nthe cornerstone of the traditional liberal defense of individual\nliberty. It protects the freedom of all mentally competent adults to\nlive however they choose, so long as they do not harm others in the\nprocess.\n\nMill goes on to stress that the harm principle is meant to apply\n\u201conly to human beings in the maturity of their faculties\u201d\n(Mill 1975,15). So, the principle permits paternalistic intervention in\nthe case of those who are not competent to make an informed decision\nabout what is in their best interests for themselves, and so who\n\u201cmust be protected against their own actions as well as external\ninjury\u201d (Mill 1975,15): for example, young children or those\nadults whose decision-making abilities are temporarily or permanently\nimpaired. Thus, if there is reliable evidence that consumption of\nviolent or misogynistic pornography impairs adolescents\u2019 ability\nto have successful long-term egalitarian sexual relationships, then\nthere is a strong liberal case for enforcing tighter age-restrictions\non consumption of pornography.\n\nIt is generally thought to follow that child pornography, which is\ntaken to involve the actual sexual abuse or exploitation of\nchildren (with or without their apparent consent), can legitimately be\nbanned in order to protect the interests of children, who are not yet\ncompetent to fully understand the nature of the choice they are making\nor to grasp the impact of their decisions on their present and future\ninterests. For the same reason, liberals think that children can quite\nrightly be prevented by parents or by the state from purchasing or\nviewing pornography if this is thought likely to harm them. That child\npornography should be banned is common ground between liberals and\nconservatives. However, pornography that involves the\nsimulated abuse of children (for example, virtual child\npornography, or consenting adult actors dressed up as schoolgirls)\ncannot legitimately be prohibited under the harm principle unless there\nis good evidence to suggest that consumption of this material causes\nsignificant harm to people other than those consenting adults involved\nin its production and consumption, for example, by causing those who\nconsume it to abuse children or by eroticizing inequality. The U.S.\nSupreme Court has ruled that virtual child pornography is protected\nspeech, partly on the basis that virtual child pornography does not\nharm actual children (Levy 2002).\n\nWe are now in a better position both to see what it would take for\nliberals to think that censorship of pornography is justified and why\nliberals have been so unsympathetic to the sort of argument against\npornography that conservatives make. Conservatives wish to prevent\nmentally competent adults from publishing and consuming pornography on\nthe grounds that the choice to consume pornography is deeply morally\nmisguided. But, as Mill insists, this is not a sufficient warrant for\ncoercive interference with individual liberty. Neither the state nor\nmoral majorities are entitled to restrict the private choices and\nactivities of individuals against their will simply because, in the\nopinion of state officials or the social majority, that way of life is\nunworthy or unrewarding. Mill thinks that this sort of legal moralism\nwill lead inevitably to a terrible \u201ctyranny of the\nmajority,\u201d crushing individual diversity and blocking human\nprogress and flourishing.\n\nHowever, following Mill, liberals are generally happy to allow that\nconsiderations of the individual or common good may entitle the state\nto use other, so-called non-coercive means to persuade\ncitizens to make wise or better choices. Thus, public education\ncampaigns designed to inform citizens of the dangers of smoking or\nexcessive alcohol consumption, or to persuade them to make\n\u201cwise\u201d choices (for example, to eat more fruits and\nvegetables) may be justified. While others cannot force an individual\nto do something (or to forbear from doing it) when they are not harming\nothers, it is entirely legitimate to seek to advise, instruct or\npersuade them. So, if there are reasons to think that pornography is\nnot good for the individual who consumes it (say, because it makes them\nless likely to be able to have successful loving or long-term\nrelationships), public education campaigns to warn consumers of these\ndangers may be justified. Indeed, education and debate is precisely the\nsolution that liberals typically recommend to counter any harm that\npornography may cause (e.g., Feinberg 1985; Donnerstein et al. 1987; R.\nDworkin 1985; for further discussion of the counter-speech response,\nsee Gelber 2021). This solution respects the freedom of rational agents\nto exercise their own rational capacities in deciding what to think and\nhow to live.\n\nHowever, liberals insist that if attempts at persuasion should fail,\nand where an individual\u2019s conduct poses no significant threat to the\nphysical security or interests of others, the state may not use\ncoercive legal mechanisms to enforce these \u201cwise\u201d choices.\n\u201cThe only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our\nown good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others\nof theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it\u201d (Mill 1975, 18).\nFor Mill, the individual person is in the best position to judge what\nis in their own best interests. Even if individuals may sometimes make\nbad choices, it is better in general that they be left free to make\nthese mistakes, for no one\u2019s opinion about the good life is infallible;\nand, in any case, a life lived \u201cfrom the inside,\u201d in\naccordance with values that the individual endorses, is more likely to\nbe happy and fulfilling than a life where the individual is forced\nagainst their will to live as others believe best.\n\nIn an influential liberal defense of pornography, Ronald Dworkin\nexpresses this commitment in terms of a right to \u201cmoral\nindependence.\u201d People, he says, \u201chave the right not to\nsuffer disadvantage in the distribution of social goods and\nopportunities, including disadvantages in the liberties permitted to\nthem by the criminal law, just on the ground that their officials or\nfellow-citizens think that their opinions about the right way for them\nto lead their own lives are ignoble or wrong\u201d (1985, 353). The\nfact, if it is one, that the majority of people in a society prefer\nthat pornography be banned because they regard it as immoral or\noffensive is not a legitimate reason for interfering with\n(pornographers\u2019) freedom of speech or for preventing consenting adults\nfrom consuming it in private. For allowing such illegitimate\n\u201cexternal\u201d preferences of a majority to dictate government\npolicy would violate the right to moral independence of the producers\nand consumers of pornography. It would give moral majorities the power\nto dictate how members of minority or non-mainstream groups can live on\nthe basis of the majority\u2019s opinions about what sort of people are most\nworthy and what sorts of lives are worth living, and this violates\nliberal ideals of state neutrality and the basic right of all\nindividuals to be treated with equal concern and respect.\n2.2.2 Pornography and Offense: Justifying Restrictions on the Public Display of Pornography\n\nHowever, Dworkin thinks, considerations of offense may provide some\njustification for preventing or restricting the public display of\npornography so as to avoid its causing offense to\nnon-consenting adults who might otherwise involuntarily or\nunwittingly be exposed to it. Joel Feinberg, another well-known liberal\ndefender of pornography, agrees. But Feinberg thinks that such\nrestrictions must be justified by a principle other than the harm\nprinciple, for he thinks that certain sorts of unpleasant psychological\nstates are not in themselves harms. Feinberg calls this additional\nprinciple the offense principle. The offense principle says\nthat \u201cIt is always a good reason in support of a proposed\ncriminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective way of\npreventing serious offense (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons\nother than the actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that\nend (i.e., there is probably no other means that is equally effective\nat no greater cost to the other values)\u201d (Feinberg 1999, 78; for\na more detailed discussion, see Feinberg 1985).\n\nLike Dworkin, Feinberg thinks that the voluntary private consumption\nof pornography does not cause harm to others. Hence, wholesale criminal\nprohibitions on the publication and private voluntary consumption of\npornography cannot be justified. But the public display of pornography\nmay nonetheless constitute an \u201coffensive nuisance\u201d to\nnon-consenting adults who are involuntarily exposed to it (just as\nneighbors who play loud music into the wee hours of the morning may be\nan \u201coffensive nuisance\u201d). Since the harm \u2013 or rather,\npseudo-harm \u2013 of pornography is the offense it may cause unwitting\nviewers involuntarily exposed to it, the solution is to restrict its\nexhibition to domains where such involuntary exposure will not occur,\nsuch as inside well sign-posted adult bookshops and cinemas where those\nwho will be offended will know not to venture (Feinberg 1983,\n105\u201313.) Although this may prevent pornographers from\ndistributing their opinions as widely as they might like and may also\ncause some minor inconvenience to consumers (who may have to go further\nout of their way to find and view pornography or suffer the\nembarrassment of having to sneak into known adult bookstores), these\ncosts may be relatively small compared with the level of offense that\ninvoluntary exposure is likely to cause. Such restrictions on the\npublic display of pornography would not amount to censorship, for\npornographers are still free to publish and distribute their opinions.\nNor would they violate consumers\u2019 right to privacy, for pornography\nwould be freely available for willing consumers to view in private. The\nWilliams Committee Report on Obscenity and Film Censorship in England\n(Williams 1981) made a similar recommendation, pointing to general\nconsiderations of public decency that prevent offensive public displays\nof conduct (e.g., nudity or sexual intercourse) that is appropriately\nseen or done only in private. Susan Wendell (1983) also agrees that the\npublic display of certain sorts of pornography \u2013 visual, audio and\nwritten material that depicts and condones the unjustified physical\ncoercion of women or other human beings \u2013 should be prohibited, although\nher particular concern is to remove the anxiety that involuntarily\nexposure to such coercive material is likely to cause women and the\nharm it is likely to do to their self-esteem.\n\nLiberal defenders of the right to pornography may thus allow that\nrestrictions on its public display may be justified. But only if\npornography can reliably be shown to cause significant harm to people\nother than those consenting adults involved in its production and\nconsumption will there be a legitimate case for prohibiting its\nvoluntary private consumption. When an individual\u2019s private\nactivities cause harm to others, they become no longer merely a private\nmatter but of legitimate public interest; and the state may be\njustified in regulating them. Thus, Dworkin says, were excessive\nconsumption of pornography shown to cause absenteeism from\nwork, then the public and the state might have some legitimate interest\nin preventing it. But, Dworkin thinks, there is as yet no reliable\nevidence that firmly establishes that the voluntary private production\nor consumption of pornography by consenting adults causes this or any\nother sufficiently significant harm to others in the relevant sense of\n\u201charm.\u201d Hence, pornography satisfies only harmless personal\npreferences for sexual gratification and is therefore none of the\nstate\u2019s business.\n2.2.3 Dangers of Censorship\n\nLiberals also have technical concerns about how censorship laws\nmight work in practice. Many liberal (and feminist) objections to\ncensorship of pornography point to the practical costs and dangers of\ncensorship, arguing that even if pornography does cause some harm to\nothers, the risks involved in censoring it are too great. They point to\nthe difficulties involved in formulating a legal definition of\n\u201cpornography\u201d that will be sufficiently precise to minimize\nthe danger that censorship laws targeting pornography will be used\n(intentionally or unintentionally) to censor other unpopular material,\nincluding valuable literary, artistic and political works. Censoring\npornography may thus place us on a dangerous slippery slope to further\ncensorship of other material; and may have a general chilling effect on\nexpression, making people reluctant to say or publish things that might\nbe construed as pornography and for which they could be prosecuted.\n(For further discussion, see Williams 1981; Schauer 1982; Easton,\n1994.)\n\nThese are significant dangers; and they need to be carefully taken\ninto account in weighing the costs and benefits of censorship as a\nsolution to any harm that pornography might cause. But it is worth\nnoting that they are inherent in many existing forms of legislation and\nare not always taken to be insoluble nor to constitute a decisive\nreason against censorship in themselves.\n",
