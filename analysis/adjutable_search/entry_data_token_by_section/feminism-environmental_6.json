    "main_text": "First Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: One Historically Associated with a Non-Feminist Environmental Philosophy || Expanded Environmental Philosophy: Feminist Philosophical Perspectives on Leopold's Land Ethics\n2.3 Expanded Environmental Philosophy: Feminist Philosophical Perspectives on Leopold's Land Ethics\nAn \u201cexpanded\u201d environmental philosophy is one that does\ntwo things: it retains some of the key features of revised\nenvironmental philosophy (e.g., consequentialist and rights-based\ntheories) while also introducing genuinely new features\u2014ones\nthat had not yet been part of a moral theory. This essay considers\nonly one \u201cexpanded\u201d environmental philosophy, Aldo\nLeopold's \u201cland ethic\u201d, published as an essay, \u201cThe\nLand Ethic\u201d, in his 1949 book The Sand County\nAlmanac. Many environmental philosophers consider Leopold's land\nethic the first genuinely environmental ethic (not just an\n\u201canimal ethic\u201d).  It is discussed here because many\nfeminist environmental philosophers defend positions that draw on\nLeopold's land ethic (e.g., Chris Cuomo 1998; Deane Curtin 1999;\nWarren 2000).\nLeopold's land ethic advances four key claims (stated here roughly\nas Leopold stated them): (1) the moral community should include soils,\nwaters, plants, and animals, or, what Leopold calls, collectively,\n\u201cthe land\u201d (Leopold 1949 [1977]: 204); (2) the role\nof homo sapiens should be changed from conqueror to plain\nmember of the land community (204); (3) we can be moral only in\nrelation to something we can see, feel, understand, love, respect,\nadmire, or otherwise have faith in (214, 223, 225); and (4) \u201ca\nthing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and\nbeauty of the biotic community; it is wrong when it tends\notherwise\u201d (224\u2013225), what some regard as Leopold's\nultimate moral maxim.\n\nMany environmental philosophers regard claim (4) as the moral maxim of\nLeopold's land ethic; it claims that the rightness or wrongness of\nactions is determined by reference to the consequences of those\nactions\u2014a familiar consequentialist ethical principle. However,\nfor Leopold, the relevant consequences are the \u201cintegrity,\nstability, and beauty of the biotic community\u201d. Since these\nconsequences are new to ethics, Leopold's land ethic expands ethics\ninto new territory\u2014territory beyond even revised environmental\nphilosophy. The same is true for the other three claims,\n(1)\u2013(3): they introduce moral concepts that go beyond those made\nby either canonical philosophy or revised environmental ethics (such\nas animal ethics). It is this \u201cgoing beyond\u201d feature that\nmakes Leopold's land ethic an expanded ethic.\n\n\nMany feminist environmental philosophers adopt key aspects of\nLeopold's land ethic. For example, many defend a notion of the self as\na relational, ecological being who is a member of the larger biotic\n(living, organic, ecological) community. Many agree that \u201cmoral\nemotions\u201d, such as empathy and care, are important to any ethic,\nincluding any environmental ethic (see, for example, Cuomo 2005;\nVrinda Dalmiya 2002; Mathews 1994b; Plumwood 1993; Warren 2000). In\naddition, many feminist environmental philosophers acknowledge that\nembryonic forms of a gendered environmental ethic can be\nfound in the opening lines of \u201cThe Land Ethic\u201d, where\nLeopold wrote, \u201cThe girls [Odysseus's slave girls] were\nproperty. The disposal of property was then, as now, a matter of\nexpediency, not of right and wrong\u201d (Leopold 1949 [1977]:\n201). Lastly, some feminist environmental philosophers endorse\nLeopold's understanding of the interconnections between cultural\ndiversity and ecological (or \u201cbio\u201d) diversity. Consider\nwhy and how understanding these interconnections is important to\nfeminist environmental philosophy.\n\n\n\nLeopold claimed that an ecological interpretation of history shows\nthat \u201cthe rich diversity of the world's cultures reflects a\ncorresponding diversity in the wilds that gave them birth\u201d (1949\n[1977]: 188). For example, Leopold wrote that cultural diversity is\n\u201coften based in wildlife. Thus the plains [sic] Indian not only\nate buffalo, but buffalo largely determined his architecture, dress,\nlanguage, arts, and religion\u201d (1949 [1977]: 177). Cultural\ndiversity reflects ecological diversity. Assuming that the\npreservation of the rich diversity of the world's\ncultures\u2014cultural diversity\u2014is a good thing, then\nunderstanding the connections between that and the preservation of\necological (or \u201cbio\u201d) diversity is also a good thing. The\nconverse is also true: ecological diversity reflects cultural\ndiversity. For example, many Western development projects in Asia and\nAfrica replace ecologically diverse (multispecies) indigenous\nforests\u2014forests that are managed by women and are integral to\nmaintaining subsistence (not money-based) economies\u2014with\nmonoculture eucalyptus and teak plantations that are managed by men\nand where trees are primarily a cash crop for export. Many feminist\nenvironmental philosophers argue against these development projects;\nthe loss of ecological diversity (provided by indigenous forests)\ndirectly and disproportionately harms women, subsistence economies,\nand the cultural communities to which women belong. These examples\nillustrate ways that Leopold's insightful awareness of the\ninterdependencies between cultural diversity and ecological (bio)\ndiversity informs a feminist environmental perspective on women-nature\nconnections (see also Sections\n 3.5 and 3.6).\n",
