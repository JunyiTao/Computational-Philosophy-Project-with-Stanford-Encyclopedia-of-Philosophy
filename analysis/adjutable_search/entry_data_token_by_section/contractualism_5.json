How does contractualism differ from other non-consequentialist ethical theories?\n\nAlthough it is not solely devoted to contractualism, Scanlon\u2019s\n2008 book Moral Dimensions: Permissibility, Meaning, Blame.\naddresses several issues of relevance to Scanlonian contractualism,\nnotably the irrelevance of intent for judgements of permissibility,\nthe distinction between two kinds of responsibility, and the analysis\nof blame. These issues help to differentiate contractualism from some\nof its non-consequentialist rivals.\n4.1. The irrelevance of intent to permissibility\n\nMany theorists distinguish non-consequentialist moral theories from\nconsequentialist rivals such as utilitarianism by emphasising the\nsignificance of agents\u2019 intentions. Otherwise\npermissible acts become impermissible when done for the wrong reason\nor in pursuit of the wrong aim. For instance, the doctrine of\ndouble effect forbids actions that aim at the death of an\ninnocent person either as an end or as a means to an end, even when\nthe same result could be permissible as a side-effect. Consider two\nfamiliar examples:\n\nDrug: \u201cIf the limited amount of a drug that is\navailable could be used either to save one patient or to save five\nothers, it is permissible to give it to the five, even though the one\nwill die. But it would not be permissible to withhold the same drug\nfrom the same person in order to save the five others by transplanting\nhis organs into them after he is dead.\u201d (Scanlon 2008, p. 1)\n\nMilitary Target: \u201cMany people believe that in war it\ncan be permissible to bomb a military target even though this will\nalso cause the deaths of some noncombatants living nearby, but that it\nwould not be permissible to bomb the same number of noncombatants in\norder to hasten the end of the war by demoralizing the\npopulation.\u201d (Scanlon 2008, p. 2)\n\nDespite its intuitive appeal, Scanlon rejects the doctrine of double\neffect, arguing that intention is not directly relevant to\npermissibility. Scanlon concedes that intentions have\npredictive significance \u2013 they help predict\nhow an agent will perform an action, and whether she is\nlikely to succeed in performing the action or in implementing any\nlarger plan of which this action might be a part. But such predictions\nare only indirectly relevant to judgements of permissibility. Scanlon\nalso agrees that intentions matter when assessing how an agent has\ndeliberated on a given occasion. But they are not relevant to\njudgements of permissibility, which ask instead\n\u201cwhether an agent may perform an action of a certain\nkind.\u201d (Scanlon 2008, p. 2.)\n\nDrawing on the work of Judith Thomson (Thomson 1986, pp.\n101\u2013102), Scanlon argues that a focus on intention can lead to\nimplausible conclusions about permissibility. Consider two familiar\nthought experiments.\n\nLoop: \u201cIn the well-known trolley-problem case it seems\npermissible to switch a runaway trolley onto a sidetrack on which it\nwill hit only one person rather than allow it to continue straight\nahead and hit five. But it also seems permissible to switch the\ntrolley in [Thomson\u2019s] Loop case \u2026 in which the sidetrack\nloops around and rejoins the main line, so that if the trolley does\nnot hit the one person and thereby come to a stop, it will continue\naround the loop and hit the five.\u201d (Scanlon 2008, p. 18.)\n\nDoctor:\u201cSuppose that a patient is fatally ill and in\ngreat pain. The only course of medication that will relieve this pain\nwill also cause the patient\u2019s death. Suppose that the patient\nwants to be given this drug. Does the permissibility of administering\nit depend on the doctor\u2019s intention in doing so?\u201d (Scanlon\n2008, p. 19.)\n\nMost people agree that switching the trolley is permissible in Loop\neven though \u201cone switches the trolley only because it will, by\nhitting the one person, be prevented from hitting the five\u201d.\n(Scanlon 2008, p. 18) But this verdict clearly violates the doctrine\nof double effect. Most also agree that it is permissible for the\ndoctor to administer the drug whatever his intention \u2013 whether\nto relieve the patient\u2019s pain, to hasten her death and thus end\nher suffering, or even to hasten the patient\u2019s death in order to\ninherit her wealth. This last intention affects our evaluation of the\ndoctor\u2019s character and deliberation. But it does not render his\naction impermissible. \u201cWhat makes an action wrong is\nthe consideration or considerations that count decisively against it,\nnot the agent\u2019s failure to give these considerations the proper\nweight.\u201d (Scanlon 2008, p. 23)\n\nFor the contractualist, justification to others provides the standard\nthat determines which considerations count decisively against\nparticular actions. In transplant cases, the contractualist question\nis whether the possibility of saving lives via transplant justifies an\nexception to the general duty to aid one\u2019s patients. Scanlon\nargues that it does not do so, because a principle permitting such an\nexception could reasonably be rejected by prospective patients. If\ndoctors withhold treatment because they intend to transplant their\npatients\u2019 organs, then this intention is wrongful because the\nact intended is wrong, and not vice versa.\n\nIt is worth noting that, while most philosophers who discuss Thomson\u2019s\nLoop share Scanlon\u2019s intuition that switching the trolley is\npermissible, this agreement is not unanimous. For instance, Liao et al.\n2012 argue that actual intuitions about Loop cases are highly variable\nand dependent on the context of presentation, and therefore that moral\ntheorists should be wary of putting too much weight on such\nintuitions. Scanlon could take this criticism on board, as his\ncontractualist framework is not wedded to any specific conclusion\nabout Loop. But he would then need to find other cases to illustrate\nhis general claims about the significance of intention. \n4.2. Blame and responsibility\n\nWhile they are not relevant for permissibility, intentions do affect\nthe meaning of actions, and thereby affect the ways that it is\nappropriate for others to respond to the agent. This brings us to\nScanlon\u2019s discussions of blame and responsibility. Scanlon\ndistinguishes two forms of responsibility.\n\n(1) Moral reaction responsibility is relevant when we ask\ncertain positive or negative moral reactions to a person \u2013 such\nas blame, resentment, praise, or gratitude \u2013 are appropriate.\nIntuitively, \u201cwhat a person has done makes such reactions\nappropriate only if the person was responsible for behaving in this\nway\u201d (Scanlon 2015, pp. 89\u201390). Scanlon originally called\nthis \u201cresponsibility as attribution\u201d, but he has come to\nprefer the label \u201cmoral reaction responsibility\u201d.\n\n(2) Substantive responsibility is relevant when we ask\nwhether a person\u2019s actions change her obligations to others, and\ntheir obligations to him or her. \u201cMaking a promise, handing over\nsome money, taking a risk, or choosing not to avail oneself of an\nopportunity can change a person\u2019s obligations to others, and\ntheirs to him or her, if the person is responsible for doing these\nthings.\u201d (Scanlon 2015, pp. 89\u201390) We return to the\ncontractualist account of substantive responsibility in section\n10.\n\nThe central question for the contractualist account of moral reaction\nresponsibility is \u201cwhat must be true for an agent to be\nidentified with a particular attitude, and thus eligible for moral\nresponses such as praise and blame\u201d. (Kumar 2015, p. 251) In the\nbackground, of course, lie traditional puzzles about free-will and\ndeterminism. Can agents fairly be blamed for actions or attitudes\nwhose ultimate causes lie beyond their control? It seems unfair to\nevaluate someone negatively for something she could not control. For\nthe contractualist, however, blame goes beyond mere evaluation. Blame\nis intimately linked to both the meaning of actions and our\nrelationships with others. \u201cThe meaning of our\ninteractions with others depends on what they see as the reasons\ngoverning those interactions. \u2026 we have reasons not to have\nattitudes of friendship or trust toward people whose attitudes toward\nus make these attitudes inappropriate.\u201d (Scanlon 2015, p.\n93)\n\nFor Scanlon, a person is blameworthy if her action shows\nsomething about her attitudes toward others that impairs the relations\nthey can have with her. I blame you if both (a) I judge you\nto be blameworthy, and (b) I take my relationship with you to be\nmodified in a way that this judgement of impaired relations holds to\nbe appropriate. (Scanlon 2008, pp. 128\u20139) Appropriate blame\nreactions include withdrawal of trust and decreased readiness to enter\ninto special relationships such as friendship or to help the person\nwith his projects. (Scanlon 2015, p. 92)\n\nSuppose I discover that my close friend Joe laughed at cruel jokes at\nmy expense at last week\u2019s party. (Scanlon 2008, pp.\n129\u201330) Joe\u2019s behaviour clearly reveals attitudes that are\ninconsistent with friendship. I may therefore conclude that my\nrelationship with Joe is impaired, and adjust my own attitudes or\nbehaviour accordingly.\n\nContractualist blame thus only makes sense within a relationship, such\nas friendship or family relationships. Impairment must be judged\nagainst the standard of what is appropriate within that\nrelationship. This raises an obvious problem. What\nrelationship could possibly ground judgements of\nblameworthiness and reactions of blame in the general moral case?\nSuppose a stranger steals my bag as I walk down the street.\nIntuitively, I can blame her. But what is my relationship to her?\n\u201cDo we have a relationship with every total stranger whom it\nmakes sense to blame?\u201d (Scanlon 2008, p. 138) Scanlon replies\nthat we do.\n\n\u201cThe contractualist claim is that all persons stand in a\nparticular kind of relationship to one another, the ideal form of\nwhich realizes a distinct value, that of mutual recognition.\u201d\n(Kumar 2015, p. 258) This idea sounds odd if we imagine a moral\nrelationship that is analogous to actual relationships such\nas a particular friendship. Contractualists instead treat the moral\nrelationship as \u201ca normative ideal, like a normative ideal of\nfriendship that specifies attitudes and expectations that we should\nhave regarding one another. \u2026 morality requires that we hold\ncertain attitudes toward one another simply in virtue of the fact that\nwe stand in the relation of \u2018fellow rational\nbeings\u2019.\u201d (Scanlon 2008, pp. 139\u201340) There are some\nbasic attitudes that we expect even from total strangers,and we are\nentitled to blame them if their behaviour demonstrates a lack of those\nattitudes.\n\nWithin contractualism, the idea of a universal moral relationship\nunifies the impersonal judgement that someone has failed to act on\nprinciples that no-one could reasonably reject with the personal\nreactions that characterise blame. Suppose I witness your bag being\nstolen. We both judge that you have been wronged. These judgements\nrest on \u201cthe general claim that it is impermissible for one\nperson to relate to another in the way she has in the type of\nsituation we find ourselves in.\u201d (Kumar 2015, p. 260) But when\nyou blame the perpetrator, you do something much more\npersonal, by also raising \u201can objection to her attitudes toward\nyou in particular, and what they say about your relationship.\u201d\n(Kumar 2015, p. 260)\n\nSome betrayals are so severe that they bring a friendship to an end.\nThe relationship cannot survive. Similarly, moral retributivists argue\nthat some horrendous actions can sever the moral relationship itself,\ncasting the person out of the sphere of mutual recognition that\ncharacterises morality. Contractualists disagree. \u201cEven those\nwho have no regard for the justifiability of their actions toward\nothers retain their basic moral rights \u2026 not to be hurt or\nkilled, to be helped when they are in dire need, and to have us honour\npromises we have made to them.\u201d (Scanlon 2008, p. 142)\nInstead,\u201cblame \u2026 involves a suspension \u2026 of\none\u2019s readiness to enter into \u2026 the range of interactions\nwith others that are morally important but not owed unconditionally to\neveryone\u201d. (Scanlon 2008, pp. 142\u20133) For instance, I might\nrefuse to make agreements with an untrustworthy person, to enter into\nother specific relations that involve trust and reliance, or to\nvoluntarily assist her pursuit of her projects even when I can do so\nat little cost to myself.\n\nScanlon\u2019s contractualist account of blame sets aside issues of\nfreewill and determinism. Because blame is a reaction to the attitudes\na person actually has, it is not undermined by the discovery that he\n\u201chad no control over the factors that made him the kind of\nperson that he is.\u201d (Scanlon 2008, p. 178) Even if you cannot\nhelp being callous, unreliable, and untrustworthy, I cannot be\nexpected to continue to treat you as if you had not revealed that, for\nwhatever reason, that is the kind of person you are.\n5. The convergence argument\n\nBefore turning to problems for contractualism, we first address a\nchallenge to its distinctiveness. In On What Matters, Derek\nParfit argues that rule consequentialism, contractualism, and the best\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s moral theory all coincide. The result\nis a triple theory, according to which \u201can act is wrong just\nwhen such acts are disallowed by some principle that is optimific,\nuniquely universally willable, and not reasonably rejectable\u201d\n(Parfit 2011, volume 1, p. 413). As contractualism presents itself as\nan alternative to both consequentialism and Kant, this would be a very\nsignificant result.\n\nThe convergence argument explicitly deals, not with Scanlon\u2019s\nown theory, but with \u201cwhat I believe to be the best version of\nScanlonian contractualism\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 1, p. 412).\nParfit defends two key \u2018improvements\u2019, by rejecting two\nrestrictions that Scanlon places on the reasons that can be offered\nfor rejecting a moral principle, namely:\n\n\u201cIndividualist Restriction: In rejecting some moral\nprinciple, we must appeal to this principle\u2019s implications only\nfor ourselves and for other single people\u201d (Parfit\n2011, volume 2, p. 193). Or, in Scanlon\u2019s own words: \u201cthe\njustifiability of a moral principle depends only on individuals\u2019\nreasons for objecting to that principle and alternatives to it\u201d\n(Scanlon 1999, p. 229).\n\u201cImpersonalist Restriction: In rejecting some moral\nprinciple, we cannot appeal to claims about the impersonal goodness or\nbadness of outcomes\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 214). Or, in\nScanlon\u2019s own words: \u201cimpersonal values are not themselves\ngrounds for reasonable rejection\u201d (Scanlon 1999, p. 222).\n\n\nIn other words, the convergence argument replaces Scanlon\u2019s\noriginal formulation of contractualism, where all reasons for\nrejection must be the personal complaints of specific individuals,\nwith a more impersonal version.\n\nIn\n section 2,\n we noted a number of differences between Kantian and Scanlonian\ncontractualism. Despite these differences, Parfit argues that\nScanlonian contractualism coincides with the best interpretation of\nKant. In a cumulative argument spread over several chapters, Parfit\nargues that the best interpretation of Kant\u2019s moral ideas yields\nthe following claim:\n\nKantian rule consequentialism: Everyone ought to follow the optimific\nprinciples, because these are the only principles that everyone could\nrationally will to be universal laws. (Parfit 2011, volume 1, p. 411)\n\n\nEven if we accept the convergence of Kant and rule consequentialism,\nit still remains to be shown that these optimific and uniquely\nuniversally willable principles are the only set of principles that\nno-one could reasonably reject. The key step in this second prong of\nthe convergence argument is the claim that \u201cwhen there is only\none relevant principle that everyone could rationally choose, no\none\u2019s objection to this principle could be as strong as the\nstrongest objection to every alternative\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume\n2, p. 245).\n\nThis key claim seems open to obvious counter-examples\u2014cases\nwhere contractualism seems to diverge from rule consequentialism. Most\nstriking are those cases where \u201cwe can either save one person\nfrom some great burden, or give much smaller benefits to many other\npeople, who are all much better-off\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p.\n246). \n\nProponents of the convergence argument must somehow explain away these\napparent counter-examples. Following Parfit, they will first will\ndivide such cases into two classes. In some cases, the optimific rule\nconsequentialist principles instruct us to favour the individual.\nConsider Scanlon\u2019s own example where we must choose between\nelectrifying an innocent person and disrupting millions of\npeople\u2019s enjoyment of a televised sporting event (Scanlon 1998,\np. 235). Here, many rule consequentialists will argue that the\noptimific rules do instruct us to save the innocent person. If so, the\nconvergence between rule consequentialism and contractualism is\nstraightforward. In its contest with rule consequentialism,\ncontractualism cannot draw its intuitive appeal from such cases.\n\nWe must turn, then, to those cases where the optimific rule\nconsequentialist principles do instruct us to provide the smaller\nbenefits to many others. Here, the convergence argument must deny that\nthe solitary individual can reasonably reject the optimific\nprinciples. This is where Parfit\u2019s \u2018improvements\u2019 on\ncontractualism are vital to the convergence argument. As originally\nformulated, contractualism departs from utilitarianism by allowing the\nindividual to reject the optimific principles whenever they place a\ngreater burden on her than her favoured principle places on\nany other single individual. Proponents of the convergence argument\nwill favour instead a more impersonal formulation. While the\nindividual\u2019s own complaint is left undiminished, other people\ncan now reject her principle on impersonal\ngrounds\u2014precisely because it fails to maximise everyone\u2019s\nwell-being. Faced with these impersonal reasons, the single individual\ncannot reasonably reject the optimific principles.\n\nDespite its provocative claims, the convergence argument is, in one\nrespect, quite modest. It does not set out to prove that rule\nconsequentialism, Kantian ethics and contractualism necessarily\ncoincide. Rather, the conclusion is merely that plausible versions of\nthe three theories do not necessarily conflict. For this\nmodest purpose, it would be sufficient to construct one plausible\nversion of contractualism on which the optimific principles cannot\nreasonably be rejected.\n\nThere is a methodological issue here. In his presentation of the\nconvergence argument, Parfit tests competing versions of\ncontractualism against intuitions regarding specific idealised cases.\nThis is not a peculiarity of Parfit\u2019s own presentation. Without\nintuitions of this kind, the convergence argument cannot get off the\nground. Proponents of individualist formulations of contractualism\nmight reply that, in some key cases, Parfit\u2019s intuitions are not\nneutral benchmarks, but rather reflect the considered moral judgements\nof a consequentialist mind. This leaves it open to Contractualists to\nsimply stick to their guns\u2014and argue that their view is\ndistinctive at the normative level, as well as the meta-ethical\nlevel.\n\nCommenting on Parfit\u2019s earlier claim that the best\ninterpretation of Kant coincides with the best form of rule\nconsequentialism, Scanlon observes that \u201cthe degree to which\nParfit\u2019s conclusion should seem surprising depends to a certain\nextent on how close the theories he is discussing are to\nKant\u2019s\u201d (Scanlon 2011, p. 117). Similar remarks apply to\nthe convergence argument. The appeal of contractualism is that it\npresents a genuine alternative to both consequentialism and Kantian\nethics. Those who are attracted to contractualism because, in certain\nkey cases, it coheres with distinctively non-utilitarian intuitions,\nare likely to regard the impersonal contractualism deployed in the\nconvergence argument as an abandonment of the core commitments of\ncontractualism. The convergence argument would then be of limited\nrelevance. We return to these issues below, when we consider the\nIndividual and Impersonal Restrictions in more detail. (See sections\n 8,\n 9, and\n 13.)\n\nParfit\u2019s convergence argument has not attracted as much\nattention as other aspects of either his work or Scanlon\u2019s. (One\nexception is Kumar 2011.) However, the general issue of the\nrelationship between contractualism and consequentialism is very\nrelevant to a number of objections to contractualism. It is always\nworth arking whether contractualism can cope adequately with new\nchallenges (such as aggregation, substantive responsibility, risk, or\nfuture people) without collapsing into rule consequentialism.\n6. Is contractualism circular or redundant?\n\nThe remainder of this entry examines problem cases for contractualism.\nThe first two concern the logical structure of\ncontractualism\u2014asking whether its account of wrongness is either\ncircular or incomplete. The next four are puzzle cases where the most\nobvious interpretation of contractualism seems to yield implausible\nresults. The last two are groups who should be included in the scope\nof morality, but who seem to be left out by contractualism: animals\nand future people.\n\nAs we saw in section 3.2, contractualism allows for the reasonable\nrejection of principles on grounds other than their direct impact on\nthe individual\u2019s well-being. However, this appeal to reasons\nbeyond well-being brings out a common objection to\ncontractualism\u2014that the whole apparatus of reasonable rejection\nis redundant. The objection is as follows. Contractualism says\nx is wrong if and only if x is forbidden by\nprinciples no-one can reasonably reject. Anyone can reasonably reject\na principle on the grounds that it permits actions that are wrong. So\na principle that no-one can reasonably reject is a principle that\npermits no actions that are wrong. If we don\u2019t already know\nwhich actions are wrong, then we cannot use the contractualist\napparatus. But if we do already know which actions are wrong, then we\ndon\u2019t need to use it.\n\nThere is a related objection using \u2018unfair\u2019 instead of\n\u2018wrong\u2019. Suppose, following our previous discussion in\n section 3,\n we agree that contractualism allows \u2018because it treats me\nunfairly\u2019 to count as a reason for rejecting a principle. We\nthen face the challenge that our judgments of unfairness are doing all\nthe real moral work, as contractualism now says that a principle is\nwrong if and only if it treats someone unfairly.\n\nTo respond to this objection, contractualists must explain why\n\u2018x is wrong\u2019 and \u2018x is\nunfair\u2019 are not the sort of claims that can feature as a reason\nfor rejecting a principle. They must also demonstrate that admitting\nreasons not based directly on well-being does not commit us to\nadmitting \u2018x is wrong\u2019 and \u2018x is\nunfair\u2019.\n\nThe Contractualist answer appeals to the conceptual link between\nwrongness and justification. Whether an act is wrong depends, not only\non its direct impact on individuals, but also on whether a principle\npermitting it can be justified to all concerned. \u2018Because it is\nwrong\u2019 is not the kind of reason that can be fed into the\ncontractualist apparatus, since it is not something that happens to\nindividuals. Instead, wrongness is something that is constructed out\nof individuals\u2019 reasons using that very apparatus. The same goes\nfor \u2018because it is unfair\u2019. In the example of the racist\nprinciple introduced in section 3.2, I reject the principle, not\nbecause it treats me unfairly overall, but because it illicitly places\nweight on an inappropriate moral distinction. My complaint\nconcerns how a principle treats me. To know whether an action\nis wrong, we must compare different people\u2019s complaints, which\nwe do by comparing one principle\u2019s treatment of me with the way\nalternative principles treat others.\n7. Is contractualism too tidy? (The pluralist challenge)\n\nAn advantage of contractualism is that it can capture the wide range\nof considerations that are relevant to moral deliberation. All the\nconsiderations that provide individuals with reasonable grounds for\nobjecting to a proposed principle are relevant. As we saw in section\n3.2, these considerations include more than the direct (and even the\nindirect) impact of a proposed principle on individual well-being.\nThis plurality of considerations is nevertheless unified by a\nsingle normative domain or subject matter: unjustifiability.\n\nSome opponents of contractualism will object that contractualism is\nnot pluralist enough. They will object to the unified account of\nwrongness. Is it plausible that all the considerations relevant to\nwhat we owe to each other are unified by their relevance to whether\nthe principle permitting the conduct could be reasonably rejected? In\nour moral deliberation about right and wrong actions, are all moral\nconsiderations only relevant in virtue of how they affect whether or\nnot a principle licensing the proposed action is justifiable?\n\nTake for example, the claim that it is wrong to inflict gratuitous\nsuffering on persons, and sentient beings in general. Imagine someone\ntorturing someone else. A utilitarian will object that, in our grasp\nof the wrongness of the action, the most salient fact is that the\nbehaviour would inflict gratuitous suffering. This is much more\nsalient than the fact that the person could reasonably reject a\nprinciple permitting such conduct. The utilitarian concludes that\nmorality is fundamentally about the avoidance of suffering. A\npluralist will conclude instead that morality is irreducibly\nplural\u2014some moral reasons are grounded on justifiability, but\nothers are grounded directly on suffering or pleasure.\n\nThe contractualist replies that what is most morally relevant in the\ncase of torture is that suffering is brought about through the\nagency of another\u2014not just that suffering occurs. This is\nwhy being tortured is morally much worse than suffering similar\ninjuries through a lightning strike\u2014the former is an affront to\nmy human dignity in a way that the latter is not. If we agree that\nthis is the really significant fact, then the advantage now lies with\nthe contractualist, whose moral theory explicitly gives a central\nplace to the notion of agency. (As ever, the dialectic can continue,\nas utilitarians can reply that torture is morally worse than a\nlightning strike because it involves a gross failure of benevolence).\nFor a foundational consequentialist account of morality (such as\nutilitarianism), the wrongness of the action is based solely and\ndirectly on the suffering it would cause. Against such an account, the\ncontractualist argues that the moral importance of promoting\nwell-being is always mediated via its effect on the justifiability of\nthe relevant principle: if an action fails to show sufficient concern\nfor someone\u2019s well-being then that person has strong grounds for\nobjecting to the principle.\n\nIt is, furthermore, important to recall that contractualism deals in\n\u2018could reasonably reject\u2019 not in \u2018does\nreject\u2019. Contractualism does not say that gratuitously causing\nsuffering is not wrong until someone objects to it, or that\ngratuitously causing suffering would not be wrong at all if\nno-one happened to object to it. There is nothing accidental about the\nfact that a particular act of gratuitously causing suffering is wrong.\nRather, gratuitously causing suffering is always intrinsically\nwrong\u2014because it is (always and everywhere) the kind of thing\nthat provides grounds for reasonable rejection.\n\nContractualism and consequentialism thus gloss what is objectionable\nabout the same conduct in different ways. Instead of a decisive\nintuition that counts against contractualism, we have a case of\ndistinctive intuitions, where different theorists, beginning from\ndifferent intuitive starting points, end up with different theoretical\npriorities.\n\n8. Can contractualism really avoid aggregation?\n We saw earlier that, unlike utilitarianism, contractualism rejects\naggregation. However, there are some cases where\ncontractualism\u2019s aversion to aggregation seems to lead to\nundesirable results. (For a variety of contractualist responses to\naggregation, see Reibetanz 1998, Norcross 2002, Kumar 2011, Fried\n2012a. See also sections 9 and 12, as contractualists and their\nopponents often discuss aggregation alongside either demandingness or\nrisk.)\n\nConsider the following situation, drawn from a\nfamous article by John Taurek (Taurek 1977).\n\n\nThe Rocks. Six innocent swimmers have become trapped on two\nrocks by the incoming tide. Five of the swimmers are on one rock,\nwhile the last swimmer is on the second rock. Each swimmer will drown\nunless they are rescued. You are the sole life-guard on duty. You have\ntime to get to one rock in your patrol-boat and save everyone on it.\nBecause of the distance between the rocks, and the speed of the tide,\nyou cannot get to both rocks in time. What should you do?\n\n\nSuppose you decide to save the lone swimmer on the second rock.\nIntuitively, this seems wrong. Surely you should have saved five\npeople instead of one. The challenge for contractualism is to explain\nwhy what you did is wrong. Utilitarians have a straightforward answer,\nbased on aggregation. You should save the five people instead of the\none simply because five deaths is a worse result than one death. This\ncase is tricky for contractualism because it rejects aggregation. The\nfive people will each want to reject the principle that\nallows you to save the one, by appealing to the fact that such a\nprinciple leaves them to die. But the lone person on the second rock\nwill want to reject any principle that allows you to save the five.\nAnd the reason for objecting to the principle is exactly the same in\neach case\u2014this principle leaves that person to die. The\nfive people cannot appeal to the fact that there are more of\nthem\u2014because this is not an individual reason. (Suppose you are\none of the five. The fact that four other people will die is not\nsomething you can object to, as it is not something that happens to\nyou.) It therefore looks as if we have reached a stalemate\u2014and\nperhaps the best solution (the principle that no-one can reasonably\nreject) is to toss a coin. That way, each of the six people gets a\nfifty-fifty chance of survival. No-one can reasonably reject\nthis principle on the grounds that it only gives\nthem a fifty-fifty chance of survival, because any alternative gives\nsomeone even less chance. Tossing a coin is the only principle that\nguarantees everyone at least a fifty-fifty chance. So it is\nthe only principle that no-one can reasonably reject.\n\nOne contractualist response is to bite the bullet, and accept that\ncoin tossing is the right answer. Many contractualists, however, wish\nto capture the intuition that you ought to save the five. Recall that\nan agent\u2019s reason for rejecting a principle can be based, not on\nits effect on her well-being, but on what that principle says about\nher or how it treats her. Imagine one of the five swimmers on the\nfirst rock arguing as follows: \u201cCoin tossing is clearly the\nright principle if there is one person on each rock, as it balances\ntheir competing reasons. If you apply the same principle when there\nare five on this rock, you are saying it makes no difference that\nthere are five rather than one. So you are acting exactly as if I\nwasn\u2019t here, facing this life and death situation. A principle\nthat allows you\u2014in effect\u2014to ignore my plight in this way\ndoesn\u2019t show respect for me. If there were one person on each\nrock, their claims to be rescued would cancel out. So we then look to\nsee whether there are other people on either rock. There are several\nsuch people, and I am one of them. My claim to be rescued remains\nun-trumped. So you should rescue the five.\u201d (For a critique of\nthis argument, see Otsuka 2001.)\n\nA further difficult kind of case for contractualism is where the\nburdens that different persons stand to suffer are unequal\u2014and\nso cannot balance each other and cancel each other out\u2014but are\nstill very severe in each case. The following example is suggested by\nDerek Parfit\u2019s discussion of contractualism and aggregation\n(Parfit 2003). Consider a choice between two scenarios. In the first,\none person suffers agony for a hundred years; while in the second a\nmillion people suffer agony for a hundred years minus a day. An\nadditional day of agony is a considerable burden. Therefore if we\nconsider the situation from the perspective of the single individuals\ninvolved, it would seem that the first person\u2019s complaint\n(\u2018I will suffer for a hundred years\u2019) outweighs the\ncomplaint of any other single individual (\u2018I will suffer for a\nhundred years minus a day\u2019). However, a utilitarian would argue\nthat, in this case, the second scenario is worse.\n\nA utilitarian might conclude that, while this ideal of choosing a\nscenario that is acceptable to each person from his or her personal\npoint of view is extremely appealing, it is not always attainable. In\nparticular, this ideal is not practical when we cannot avoid placing a\nsevere burden on at least one person. Contractualism focuses each\nperson\u2019s mind on the burdens imposed on himself or herself, and\non other individuals\u2014and invites us to withdraw our burdens if\nwe see other individuals suffering much more under a competing\nprinciple. However, in our present example, each of the individuals in\nthe second scenario would find the situation unacceptable from their\npersonal point of view, simply because of the magnitude of the\nsuffering it involves. It is not plausible that they would withdraw\ntheir complaint because the person in the first scenario stands to\nsuffer a slightly greater burden. It can be argued that in such cases\nwe should give intrinsic moral weight to the number of persons who\nsuffer a severe burden and so minimise the number of persons for whom\nthe situation is unacceptable.\n\nThe contractualist has several possible replies. They could simply\ndeny the utilitarian\u2019s intuition. Perhaps it is wrong to impose\na greater burden on a single person, even to save many others from a\nslightly worse burden. Contractualists who want to capture the\nutilitarian\u2019s intuition might argue that, just as complaints are\nnot always tied to well-being, the strength of an individual\u2019s\ncomplaint need not be proportional to the loss of well-being. Perhaps\na principle that allows me to suffer for a century minus a day is just\nas objectionable to me as one that allows me to suffer for a century.\nOnce the complaints are on a par, we can then appeal to our earlier\ntie-breaking method, and conclude that it is wrong to favour the one\nover the many. (A utilitarian will reply that in any context a day of\nagony is an enormous moral burden\u2014it is no less bad if the\nperson has already suffered for almost a century\u2014so that the\ncomplaint of the individual in the first scenario has to be seen as\nsignificantly greater than that of any individual in the second\nscenario.)\n\nIn chapter 21 of On What Matters, Parfit presents further\narguments that can be deployed against the individualist\nrestriction\u2014which limits the grounds for rejecting a principle\nto its implications for single people. First, Parfit presents\na series of cases where, he argues, \u201cany contractualism that\nincorporates the individualist restriction must conflict with all\nplausible views about the distribution of benefits and burdens\u201d\n(Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 198). One representative case is the\nfollowing (Parfit 2011, volume 2, pp. 199\u2013200):\n\nCase Six: The only possible alternatives are these:\n\n\n\n\nBlue will live to the age\nof:\nEach of some number of\nother people will live to: \n\nWe do nothing\n30\n30 \n\nWe do A\n70\n30 \n\nWe do B\n35\n35 \n\n\n\nFollowing Parfit, utilitarians will object that, if we endorse the\nindividualist restriction, then \u201cwe ought to give Blue her 40\nmore years of life rather than giving 5 more years to Blue and to as\nmany as a million of these other people. \u2026 this is\nclearly false\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 200).\n\nSecond, Parfit offers a new argument that, when the individualist\nrestriction does enable the contractualist to reach the right\nconclusions, it cannot do so for the right reasons. Consider the\nfollowing case (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 196):\n\nCase Three: The only possible alternatives are these:\n\n\n\n\nFuture days of pain \n\n\nfor Blue:\nfor each of some number of\nother people: \n\nWe do nothing\n100\n10 \n\nWe treat Blue\n0\n10 \n\nWe treat the others\n100\n0 \n\n\n\nHere, the utilitarian says that, if the number of other people exceeds\nten, then we should treat the others, as this maximises total\nwell-being. Parfit argues that \u201cmost of us would reject this\nutilitarian claim, believing instead that we ought to save Blue from\nher great ordeal. We might even believe that we ought to save Blue\nfrom her 100 days of pain rather than saving any number of\nsuch other people from their much smaller burden of 10 days of\npain\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 2, pp. 196\u20137).\n\nThe individualist restriction enables contractualism to diverge from\nutilitarianism in this case. Because the other people\u2019s reasons\ncannot be aggregated, they cannot ever outweigh Blue\u2019s reason.\nBut opponents of the individualist restriction will object that this\nis a coincidence. The real reason we should treat Blue is not because\nBlue\u2019s burden would otherwise be greater, but because Blue would\notherwise be so much worse-off. For instance, suppose instead that, if\nwe do nothing, everyone (Blue included) will suffer 100 days of pain\n[This is Parfit\u2019s Case Four]. We must now choose\nbetween relieving Blue of all of her 100 days, or relieving\neveryone (Blue included) of 10 of their 100 days of pain. Those who\nfavour a more impersonal formulation of contractualism will object\nthat the individualist restriction must instruct us to do the former.\n\u201cAnd [this conclusion] is clearly false\u201d (Parfit 2011,\nvolume 2, p. 202).\n\nIn Cases Four and Six, opponents of the individualist restriction will\nargue that we can only get the right result by allowing the other\npeople to pool their individual complaints\u2014otherwise, they\ncannot hope to overrule Blue. Those who find this intuition compelling\nmay conclude that contractualists must drop the individualist\nrestriction, and instead accommodate Case Three by saying that\n\u201cpeople have stronger moral claims, and stronger grounds to\nreject some principle, the worse off these people are\u201d (Parfit\n2011, volume 2, p. 202). Other contractualists may be prepared to bite\nthe bullet here, or to seek alternative ways to accommodate these\nintuitions, on the grounds that the individualist restriction is an\nessential feature of contractualism, without which contractualism\ncannot hope to escape the extreme and alienating demands of\nutilitarianism\u2014the topic of the next section.\n9. What does contractualism demand?\n\nImpartial theories are often accused of being unreasonably demanding.\nFor instance, consider the fact that there are very many very needy\npeople in the world. A variety of aid agencies, which currently rely\non donations from private individuals, can alleviate these needs. No\ndoubt governments, multinationals, and others could do far more than\nthey do. But the question still remains: faced with such urgent needs,\nat least some of which I could meet at comparatively little cost to\nmyself, how should I as an individual act?\n\nImpartial moral theories often seem to give very demanding answers to\nthis question. This is easiest to see for utilitarianism.\nUtilitarianism tells me to put my dollars wherever they will do the\nmost good. In the hands of a reputable aid agency, my dollar could\nsave a child from a crippling illness, and so I am obligated to donate\nit to the aid agency. I should give my next dollar to an aid agency,\nand I must keep donating till I reach the point where my own basic\nneeds, or my ability to keep earning dollars, are in jeopardy. Most of\nmy current activities will have to go. Nor will my sacrifice be only\nfinancial. According to utilitarianism, I should also spend my time\nwhere it will do most good. I should devote all my energies to aid\nwork, as well as all my money.\n\nPerhaps we would admire someone who behaved in this way. But is it\nplausible to claim that those of us who do not are guilty of\nwrongdoing; or that we have a moral obligation to devote all our\nresources to charity? Such conclusions strike many people as absurd.\nThis leads to the common objection that utilitarianism is unreasonably\ndemanding, as it leaves the agent too little room (time, resources,\nenergy) for her own projects or interests.\n\nThis is a serious objection to utilitarianism. If contractualism can\navoid a similar fate, then this will be a significant advantage. But\nis contractualism less demanding than utilitarianism? It certainly\nseems possible that contractualism will generate very demanding\nprinciples, as it seems reasonable for those who are starving to\nreject any principle permitting me to retain inessential resources\nrather than meeting their most basic needs. I would then be doing\nsomething wrong unless I do all that I can to save other\npeople\u2019s lives\u2014at least until I reach the level below\nwhich I would be giving up necessary components of my own\nwell-being.\n\nA similar problem for contractualism is presented by Thomas Nagel, who\nargues that, in the present state of the world, it may be impossible\nto construct any set of principles which no-one can\nreasonably reject. Any possible principle of aid will either make\nunreasonable demands on the affluent (from their point of view), or\npay inadequate attention to the basic needs of the destitute (from\ntheir point of view). If the notion of reasonable rejection is at\nleast partly determined by the agent\u2019s own perspective, then any\nprinciple will be reasonably rejected by someone. (Nagel 1991 and\n1999).\n\nContractualists might reply that principles of aid presuppose some\nbackground set of entitlements, guaranteeing me the free use of my own\nresources. This raises two problems. The first is that, from the fact\nthat I own something, it does not follow that I do not have an\nobligation to give it away. The most that might follow is that others\nmay not force me to do so. The second problem is that, if our overall\ntheory is Contractualist, then the property rights themselves must be\ngiven a Contractualist justification. We need a system of property\nrights no-one can reasonably reject. Any system where property rights\nare very unequally distributed will be rejected by those who miss\nout.\n\nHow might contractualism reply to this demandingness objection? Like\nany impartial moral theory, contractualism can bite the bullet, and\nargue that morality is very demanding. The contractualist apparatus\nexplains why morality is demanding\u2014if we seek to act in\na way that we could justify to others, then we must adopt principles\nthat no-one can reasonably reject. Given the state of the world, these\nprinciples will seem very demanding to those who are\naffluent\u2014but the alternative would be principles that place an\neven greater burden on those who are worst-off.\n\nFor instance, Scanlon himself reaches the following principle through\ncontractualist reasoning:\n\n\nThe Rescue Principle:\nIf we can prevent something very bad from happening to someone by\nmaking a slight or even moderate sacrifice, it would be wrong not to\ndo so (Scanlon 1998, p. 224).\n\n\nThis principle could make very significant demands, especially if we\nwere continually facing situations where a slight sacrifice would save\nsomeone\u2019s life. If my sacrifice is much less than the very bad\nthing I prevent, it is hard to see how I can reasonably reject this\nprinciple.\n\nMore controversially, one of us has argued previously that analogous\nreasoning leads to an even more demanding principle.\n\nThe Stringent Principle:\nIf we can prevent something very bad from happening to someone by\nmaking a great sacrifice (e.g., giving most of our income to aid\nagencies and spending a lot of our spare time on campaigning and\nfund-raising), it would be wrong not to do so (Ashford 2003, p.\n287).\n\n\nIf the \u2018great sacrifice\u2019 is nevertheless significantly\nless bad than the \u2018very bad thing\u2019 that might happen, it\nis hard to see how I can reasonably reject this principle. If the\n\u2018very bad thing\u2019 is an agonising death, this principle can\nbe very demanding indeed.\n\nIt may be argued that even if this stringent principle follows from\ncontractualism, that is not a problem for the theory. Perhaps, in the\ncurrent state of the world, we should expect any moral theory grounded\non each person\u2019s equal moral status to be extremely demanding,\ngiven the drastic and irrevocable impact on those in need if they are\nnot helped, and the fact that there are constantly so many in this\nposition (Ashford 2003, p. 292\u20132).\n\nHowever, many moral philosophers\u2014contractualists\nincluded\u2014seek a more moderate moral theory. If contractualism is\nto avoid being extremely demanding, the challenge is to stop short of\nthe stringent principle. We need to find a principle that allows me to\nchoose my own lesser good over a (significantly) greater good for\nsomeone else\u2014and then to show that this principle cannot be\nreasonably rejected. For instance, suppose I spend my spare evening\n(and spare income) going to the movies rather than donating the time\nand money to a charity which could thus have saved someone\u2019s\nlife. We need an explanation of why those who die as a result cannot\nreasonably reject the principle that permits this behaviour.\n\nThe most promising answer lies, once again, in the possibility that my\ngrounds for rejecting a principle are not necessarily confined to its\ndirect impact on my well-being. I might reject a principle requiring\nme to devote all my time and energy to charity, not simply because of\nthe burdens it imposes on me but because, in leaving me no room for my\nown personal projects, it fails to respect me as a person. (The\ndestitute person will reply that a principle allowing me to leave her\nto starve fails to respect her as a person. The challenge for the\ncontractualist is to distinguish these two complaints. For one\nattempt, see Kumar 2000.)\n\nResponding to Parfit\u2019s presentation of the convergence argument,\nand his critique of the individualist and impersonal restrictions,\nScanlon notes that, because it rejects those restrictions, any\nimpersonal reformulation of contractualism is much more demanding than\nthe original formulation of contractualism (Scanlon 2011). This charge\nhas a particular dialectical significance, as rule consequentialists\noften present their theory as a more moderate alternative to the\nextreme demands of act consequentialism. If it retains those\nrestrictions, contractualism will always be less demanding than these\nalternative theories\u2014even if its demands are greater than\ncommonsense morality might normally expect.\n10. The contractualist account of substantive responsibility\n\nQuestions of substantive responsibility arise when we must decide who\nwill bear what burdens. \u201cTo hold a person who has ended up\nburdened to be substantively responsible for that burden is to hold it\nto be hers to bear, ceteris paribus. No one owes it to her to share or\nalleviate it.\u201d (Kumar 2015, p. 252) Kumar explains the\ncontractualist account of substantive responsibility as follows.\n\u201cA person who ends up burdened is substantively responsible for\nit if no one owed it to her to do more to enable her to avert it. To\nhold her not to be wronged in ending up burdened just is to hold her\nto be substantively responsible for it. The reasons that are relevant\nto the justification of why she is not wronged are those that\nestablish that she has good reason to want what happens to her in that\ntype of situation to depend on how she responds to alternatives, and\nthat enough was done to secure that dependence.\u201d (Kumar 2015, p.\n253)\n\nContractualism claims to offer an intuitive account of when agents can\nreasonably be expected to bear burdens. Critics argue that this\npromise is illusory and that contractualism fails to respect our\nintuitive judgements of substantive responsibility. (Williams 2006,\nVoorhoeve 2008.)\n\nDiscussion often focuses on the following example:\n\nHazardous Waste: A city\u2019s officials need to remove and\ndispose of hazardous waste found near a residential area. This removal\nwill release some hazardous chemicals, but it is much less dangerous\nthan leaving the waste where it is. Even if the officials take all\nreasonable precautions, some hazardous material will be released\n\u2013 enough to cause lung damage to anyone directly exposed but not\nenough to pose a serious threat to anyone who stays indoors and away\nfrom the excavation site. (Scanlon 1998, p. 257; Kumar 2015, p.\n264)\n\nIntuitively, so long as they warn people to stay indoors while the\nwaste is being removed, the city officials can legitimately remove the\nhazardous waste. This does expose some people to a risk of serious\nharm. But all available alternatives are worse: the waste cannot be\nleft where it is, and evacuating the city is not feasible. A principle\npermitting officials to expose some people to a risk of harm in order\nto protect public health is one that no one can reasonably reject.\n\nSuppose the officials have done enough to reduce the risk. Leaflets\nhave been delivered to all households, announcements made on radio,\ntelevision, and social media, advertisements placed in newspapers,\nbarriers erected around the excavation site, warnings posted at all\nentrances, and so on. But now consider one citizen of the city (call\nher Curious), who is counter-suggestible. Warnings and barriers merely\nserve to pique her curiosity. Curious had no prior interest in\nhazardous waste. But she now develops a desire to see what all the\nfuss is about. Ignoring the warnings, Curious climbs over the barriers\nand exposes herself to a dangerous dose of hazardous chemicals.\n\nCurious\u2019s burden results, in a fairly predictable way, from her\nown reckless choice. Intuitively, this renders her substantively\nresponsible for that burden. Curious cannot hold others responsible\nfor her burden. For instance, she cannot sue the city (or its\nofficials) to cover her medical costs. One natural explanation for\nthis intuition is the Forfeiture View: by disregarding\nwarnings, Curious has forfeited her right to expect others either to\navoid exposing her to harm or to alleviate her burden if she is\nharmed.\n\nScanlon rejects the Forfeiture View in favour of a Value of\nChoice account, which emphasises: \u201cthe reasons that\nindividuals have to want what happens to them, and their obligations\nto others and others\u2019 obligations to them, to depend on how they\nrespond.\u201d (Scanlon 2015, p. 106) On this view, it is the\navailability of choice that matters, not whether the agent\nhas made any actual choice. If I am told that I must collect\nmy theatre tickets by a certain time and I then absentmindedly fail to\ncollect them in time, then I am responsible for the fact that I miss\nthe performance. What matters is that I had the opportunity to avoid\nthis situation, even though I made no conscious decision. (Scanlon\n2015, p. 108)\n\nContractualist principles must be justified to each person. This\njustification must cite some reason why a given principle makes sense\nto that person. In the Hazardous Waste case, contractualists argue\nthat each person has reason to value living in a society where her\nfate depends (in part) on her own choices, even if the result is that\nshe sometimes finds herself responsible for burdens that she could\nhave avoided and has not conscious chosen.\n\nCritics argue that contractualists who cite the Value of Choice cannot\njustify intuitive principles in the Hazardous Waste case. The\nopportunity to choose is not valuable for Curious. On the\ncontrary, that opportunity clearly makes her worse-off! Consider the\nfollowing variant of the original case.\n\nCautionary vs Covert: Officials have two options for dealing\nwith hazardous waste. Under a Cautionary Policy, officials\nissue public warnings, erect barriers, and so on. Under a Covert\nPolicy, officials remove the waste in secret, depriving the\npublic of any knowledge of the risk. Suppose officials know that,\nwhile the Cautionary Policy will result in a larger number of lung\ndamage cases, every afflicted person will be someone who heard the\nwarnings and failed to heed them. By contrast, while the Covert Policy\nwill result in a smaller number of lung damage cases, none of\nthose people will have had any opportunity to avoid harm.\nWhich policy should the officials choose? (Williams 2006, p. 253;\nKumar 2015, p. 269)\n\nIntuitively, the officials should choose the Cautionary Policy instead\nof the Covert one, even though more people will suffer harm. Critics\nobject that contractualists using the Value of Choice cannot capture\nthis result. (Williams 2006). Consider Curious. The Covert Policy\noffers her greater protection from harm than the Cautionary Policy,\nbecause her chance of suffering harm is higher under the latter than\nunder the former. And because she is impetuously curious, warnings and\nother information have negative value for Curious. The opportunity to\nchoose only makes her worse-off. Therefore, Curious can reasonably\nreject the Cautionary Policy.\n\nContractualists agree that the Cautionary Policy is \u201cthe only\nmorally defensible choice\u201d (Kumar 2015, p. 269). However, they\nargue that contractualism can deliver this result, for two reasons.\nFirst, even if the covert policy is instrumentally superior,\nall moral agents have strong symbolic reasons for \u201cnot\nwanting it to be permissible for public officials to hide important\ninformation because they decide that members of the public are not\ncompetent to assess it and respond appropriately\u201d (Kumar 2015,\np. 270). Covert paternalism clearly fails to treat people as\nresponsible adults, and therefore everyone has reason to reject it.\nSecond, Contractualists will appeal to the need to evaluate principles\nagainst generic standpoints, rather than against the eccentric\npreferences of particular individuals.\u201cOur assessment cannot be\nbased on the particular aims, preferences, and other characteristics\nof specific individuals. We must rely instead on commonly available\ninformation about what people have reason to want \u2026 about\ngeneric reasons.\u201d (Scanlon 1998, p. 203) What matters is not\nwhat Curious wants, but what a representative person\nin her situation would have reason to want. And people in general have\nreason to want control over their exposure to risk. Generic reasons\nalso play a key role in contractualist accounts of risk (section 11)\nand our obligations to future people (section 13).\n11. How does contractualism deal with risk?\n\nMoral philosophers often discuss artificial examples involving\ncertainty. In particular, discussion of the ethics of harm focuses on\ncases where each action will definitely harm some particular person.\nBut real-life ethics invariably involves widespread uncertainty. Most\nactual \u201charmful\u201d activities are socially productive ones\nthat impose some risk of harm on others. (Fried 2012a, 2012b) Can\nContractualists provide a plausible and distinctive account of when\nand why such activities are permitted? (For more detailed discussion\nof a variety of Contractualist accounts of risk, see Frick 2015, Fried\n2012a, Horton 2017, Kumar 2015.)\n\nWe begin with a simple example:\n\nDriving: Bob lives in a large city in the developed world.\nHis daily life is greatly enhanced by the fact that he and others are\nable to drive cars. Bob drives to work, drives out of town for the\nweekend, drives to the local shopping mall, enjoys goods and services\nthat are only available because others can drive, and so on. One\nmorning, while walking his dog along the street, Bob is killed in a\ntraffic accident. The driver was not at fault \u2013 she was not\nspeeding or drunk or otherwise irresponsible. Bob is just unlucky. In\na large city where millions of people drive every day, faultless fatal\naccidents like this are bound to happen from time to time.\n\nOver the course of his life, Bob received many benefits from his and\nothers\u2019 driving. But suppose these are outweighed by the cost of\nhis untimely death. As things turned out, Bob would have been\nbetter-off if driving had not been permitted. This seems to give Bob a\nreason to reject any principle that permits driving. And this reason\nseems to outweigh other people\u2019s reasons to want driving to be\npermitted. (After all, any inconvenience they suffered would not be as\nbad as an early death.) It therefore seems that contractualism cannot\npermit driving. Indeed, contractualism must prohibit all\nsocially useful activities that carry any risk of harm\n\u2013 on the grounds that, in a large population, over the course of\na lifetime, any such activity is virtually certain to lead to at least\none death.\n\nUtilitarians have an easy solution. Driving should be permitted if it\nmaximises expected aggregate welfare. A small risk of death is\noutweighed by a large number of individual benefits. If Contractualism\ncannot permit any risky activities, then this places it at a distinct\ndisadvantage against utilitarianism.\n\nOne simple solution is to restrict the scope of contractualism. If\ncontractualism deals only with cases where harm is certain, then it\nneed not address risk at all. We could then combine a contractualist\naccount of certain harm with a utilitarian account of risks of harm.\nUnfortunately, this solution has a high cost. Given the ubiquity of\nrisk, and the comparative rarity of cases of certain harm, this\npluralist option effectively sidelines contractualism.\n\nA second simple solution is to bite the bullet, and insist that risky\nsocial activities are never permitted. Few contractualists embrace\nthis extreme revisionism. And it too threatens irrelevance. People\nwill never abandon risk altogether, and we naturally turn to ethical\ntheory to guide us through our risky activities. If contractualism is\nsilent in this crucial area, then it loses any claim to be of\npractical relevance.\n\nThe challenge for contractualism is to steer a middle-way between\nbanning risk altogether and collapsing into utilitarianism.\n\nOne central question is whether our contractualist evaluation of risk\nshould be ex post or ex ante. Contractualism tells us to justify our\nmoral principles to each person. A principle permitting driving must\nbe justified to Bob. But when do we imagine this justification\noccurring? Suppose we were to offer Bob a choice between two\nprinciples: one permits driving and the other forbids it. When does\nBob make this choice? Does he choose in advance \u2013 perhaps before\nhe moves to the city or before his life begins? Or does he choose in\nretrospect \u2013 after he knows how his life has actually gone?\n\nIn cases involving risk and uncertainty, these two temporal\nperspectives represent very different epistemological standpoints. Ex\nante, Bob knows that living in a city where driving is permitted\nexposes him to a very small risk of death in a car accident where no\none is at fault. Ex post, Bob knows that living in a city where\ndriving is permitted has in fact resulted in his death.\n\nSome forms of contractualism explicitly favour ex ante rather than ex\npost evaluation. Rawls, for instance, asks his parties to choose\nprinciples to govern their society on the basis of general knowledge\nabout how their lives might go, rather than particular information\nabout their specific circumstances. Scanlonian contractualism, by\ncontrast, usually requires justification to actual people who are\naware of their own situation. In his 1998 book, Scanlon explicitly\nfavours ex post justification. However, most contractualists\n(including Scanlon himself) now favour either ex ante contractualism\nor some hybrid view combining both ex ante and ex post evaluations.\n(Scanlon 2013, Kumar 2015, Frick 2015.)\n\nIn our original Driving case, ex ante justification seems to delivers\nthe intuitively correct result. When he views the prospects in\nadvance, Bob may well conclude that the very small risk of death is\noutweighed \u2013 from his own perspective \u2013 by the large\nnumber of benefits he is almost certain to enjoy. If the imbalance is\nsufficiently great, we might conclude that it would not be reasonable\nfor Bob to reject a principle that permits driving. (Some extremely\nrisk-averse individuals will perhaps still object to driving, but\ncontractualists can reply that this rejection is not reasonable.)\n\nUnfortunately, there are two problems with this contractualist\nresponse. First, if all citizens face the same pattern of risks and\nbenefits, then this ex ante justification threatens to collapse into\nutilitarianism in practice. Contractualism thus risks losing its\ndistinctiveness. Second, if citizens face different risk profiles,\nthen even ex ante contractualism may still find itself unable to\njustify any risky behaviour. Consider a new example:\n\nFlying: Commercial air travel brings many benefits to many\npeople. However, it also brings small risks of death. Some of this\nrisk falls on people who benefit from air travel \u2013 notably\npassengers. But some people exposed to the same risks enjoy no\nbenefits. Jeb is an Amish farmer who completely eschews all the\n\u2018benefits\u2019 of modern life. Jeb lives under the flightpath\nof air traffic between two major cities. (Jeb was not consulted about\nthis flightpath.) One day, debris from a passing airplane falls on Jeb\nand kills him. (This example is adapted from Kumar 2015, which draws\non Ashford 2003.)\n\nJeb obviously has a strong ex post complaint against any principle\npermitting flying. But he also has an ex ante complaint. Even before\nhe knows that he will be killed by falling debris, Jeb expects no\nbenefit whatsoever from flying. (Indeed, he does not regard flying as\ntruly beneficial to anyone!) Jeb will want to reject in advance any\nprinciple that imposes on him a risk of death without any compensating\nbenefits. From a contractualist perspective, this rejection seems\nreasonable.\n\nThe two challenges for ex ante contractualists are (a) to offer a\nprincipled justification for rejecting Jeb\u2019s complaint; and (b)\nto ensure that that justification does not collapse into\nutilitarianism. One possibility is to argue that, like Curious, Jeb is\ntoo eccentric for contractualist purposes. We should be asking what\npeople in general have reason to reject, rather than examining the\nstrange predilections of singular individuals. However, unlike\nCurious\u2019s counter-suggestible risk-seeking, Jeb\u2019s\nrejection of modern life is considered and (prima facie) reasonable.\nIf contractualism rejects Jeb\u2019s considered worldview as\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d, then he might object that contractualism\nthereby fails to treat him with the respect due to a rational\nagent.\n\nA better alternative for the contractualist is to focus on broader\nprinciples that apply to all risky activities, rather than artificial\nprinciples relating only to flying. Jeb gains no benefit from air\ntravel. But he, along with everyone else, does benefit from living in\na society where everyone is free to pursue their own goals according\nto their own values. Jeb thus has reason to reject any principle that\nprevents people in general from pursuing reasonable lifestyle options,\neven if some of those options impose small risks of death on\nothers.\n\nAnother problem for ex ante contractualism is that, in some other\npossible cases, it is ex post evaluation that seems most appropriate.\nContrast two scenarios introduced by Frances Kamm (Kamm 2007, p. 273;\nFried 2012a, p. 47):\n\nAmbulance I: Should our city authorize its ambulances to\nspeed on the way to the hospital whenever it is the case that doing so\nwill save five sick passengers for every one pedestrian who is killed\nas a result of the speeding?\n\nAmbulance II: Should our city also prohibit its ambulance\ndrivers from braking to save an identifiable pedestrian\u2019s life\nwhenever it is the case that the time lost by braking will cause the\nfive passengers inside the ambulance to die?\n\nMany people judge that the first policy is permissible while the\nsecond is not. (Kamm 2007, Lenman 2008) This leads some\ncontractualists to favour hybrid view that combine ex post and ex ante\nevaluation. (e.g., Lenman 2008) It is one thing to ask everyone to\nagree in advance to a policy that will predictably result in the\ndeaths of some pedestrians, but another thing altogether to ask\nthis particular pedestrian to lay down her life for the\ngreater good!\n\nUnfortunately, critics of contractualism allege that hybrid views\nproduce implausible results of their own in cases where the parties\nhave asymmetric information about their fate. (Fried 2012a, pp.\n53\u201354) Consider a final case introduced by Sophia Reibetanz\n(Reibetanz 1998):\n\nUnexploded Mines: One hundred workers are working in a field\nknown to contain an unexploded mine. Another person, Z, is the only\none who could disarm the mine. If Z disarms the mine, then Z is\ncertain to get pneumonia. If Z doesn\u2019t disarm the mine, then it\nis certain that 1 of the 100 workers will be seriously injured. This\nserious injury is ten times worse than suffering pneumonia.\n\nZ faces a certainty of (minor) harm, while each worker faces a 1%\nchance of (greater) harm. If Z is allowed to appeal to this\ninformation asymmetry, then Z\u2019s complaint trumps the complaint\nof any individual worker. Z can thus reasonably reject any principle\nthat requires Z to disarm the mine. But this seems counter-intuitive,\nas the certain result is a much greater harm for someone else. The\nchallenge for hybrid contractualists is either to avoid this result or\nto explain why it is justified. (Ostuka 2011, Reibetanz 1998. For an\nargument that contractualism cannot solve this problem, see Fried\n2012a, p. 54)\n12. Can contractualism protect animals?\n\nSocial contract theories notoriously leave out non-human animals. If\nall moral obligations are between parties to the social contract, then\nwe have no obligations regarding animals who cannot be parties to the\ncontract. So (for instance) torturing non-rational animals cannot be\nwrong. By contrast, utilitarians have no difficulty explaining why it\nis wrong to torture animals. This seems to place contractualism at a\ncomparative disadvantage. Can contractualism provide an adequate\naccount of our moral obligations to animals? Does it need to?\n\nScanlon offers two solutions. The first is to limit the scope of his\naccount. Contractualism is not an account of the whole of morality,\nbut only an account of the morality of what we owe to other persons.\nThis leaves open the possibility that our obligations to animals fall\noutside this part of morality. Scanlon also explicitly puts aside any\nmoral obligations we might have in regard to the natural environment\n(Scanlon 1998, p. 179). \n\nScanlon also suggests a possible way that obligations to animals could\nbe accommodated within contractualism. This is via the notion of\ntrustees, to whom justifications of proposed principles can be\noffered, on behalf of the animals they represent (Scanlon 1998, p.\n183).\n\nUtilitarians will object that this second solution provides too\nindirect an account of what ultimately grounds our obligations to\nanimals. The fact that it is wrong to inflict unnecessary pain on\nanimals is not most plausibly explained via the notion of whether this\nbehaviour could be justified to a trustee of the animals. Rather, it\nis wrong simply because of the suffering the animal feels. A\nutilitarian will add that, once we realise that this is what is wrong\nin the case of animal suffering, we should draw the same conclusion\nabout human suffering. It is their capacity for suffering rather than\ntheir capacity for rational agency that plays the most salient role in\nexplaining the wrongness of torturing humans.\n\nA contractualist can reply as follows. Contractualism captures the\ncentral sense of wrongness, one that plays a role in how individuals\nunderstand what they are accountable to one another for. The case of\nanimals shows that this is not the only notion of wrongness. But, once\nwe reflect on the differences between the two cases, we see why our\nobligations to one another are so different from any obligations we\nmight have to animals\u2014precisely because we cannot meaningfully\njustify ourselves to them. Animals are not a special problem\nfor the contractualist, but rather an opportunity to explore what is\ndistinctive about the contractualist approach.\n13. Can contractualism protect future people?\n\nAnother problem facing any social contract theory concerns our\nobligations to future people. It is hard to see how we can have any\nobligations to such people, as they cannot be parties to our contract.\nThis is principally because of the absence of any possibility of\nmutually advantageous interaction between distant\ngenerations. The quality of life of future generations depends to a\nvery large extent on the decisions of the present generation. By\ncontrast, our quality of life is not affected at all by their\ndecisions. We can do a great deal to (or for) posterity but posterity\ncannot do anything to (or for) us. This power imbalance is often\ncharacterised in terms of the absence of Hume\u2019s\n\u201ccircumstances of justice\u201d. (The phrase is borrowed from\nRawls 1971, pp. 126\u2013130.)\n\nFor contractarians, for whom morality is an agreement for\nmutual advantage, it follows that we have no obligations to future\npeople with whom we cannot interact. A similar problem arises for\nthose like Rawls who seek to base the social contract on some\nmodification of self-interested behaviour\u2014such as self-interest\nbehind the veil of ignorance.\n\nContractualism, by contrast, easily avoids this particular problem, as\nit begins by assuming that moral agents are motivated by a desire to\njustify themselves to others. There is no reason why those others must\nbe currently existing people. When deciding how to act, I can ask\nmyself whether future people who are affected by my actions might\nreasonably reject a principle permitting those actions. For instance,\nif I want to construct a power plant that will leak radiation in the\nfuture, it makes perfect sense to ask whether those who will suffer as\na result might reasonably object to my behaviour. Because it works\nwith the possibility of reasonable rejection\u2014rather than actual\nbargaining\u2014contractualism can accommodate obligations to future\npeople. This is a significant advantage over other social contract\ntheories.\n\nHowever, there is a second problem regarding future people\u2014one\nthat does seem to apply to contractualism. This problem owes its\nprominence in recent philosophical debate to the work of Derek Parfit,\nto whom we owe the following example (Parfit 1984, pp.\n351\u2013379):\n\nThe Summer or Winter Child. Mary is deciding when to have a\nchild. She could have one in summer or in winter. Mary suffers from a\nrare condition which means that, if she has her child in winter, it\nwill suffer serious ailments which will reduce the quality of its\nlife. However, a child born in winter would still have a life worth\nliving, and, if Mary decides to have a child in summer, then an\naltogether different child will be born. It is mildly inconvenient for\nMary to have a child in summer. (Perhaps she doesn\u2019t fancy being\nheavily pregnant during hot weather.) Therefore, she opts for a winter\nbirth.\n\n\nMary\u2019s behaviour seems morally wrong. Utilitarians have a simple\naccount of why Mary\u2019s behaviour is wrong, as she brings about\nless human happiness than she could have done. Yet it seems that\ncontractualism cannot capture this intuition. Consider a principle\npermitting Mary\u2019s behaviour. If Mary\u2019s behaviour is wrong,\nthen this principle must be one that someone can reasonably reject.\nBut who? Not the Winter Child\u2014because he would otherwise never\nhave existed at all. And not the Summer Child\u2014because he\ndoesn\u2019t exist.\n\nPerhaps the most promising contractualist defence lies, once again, in\nthe possibility that my grounds for rejecting a principle are not\nnecessarily confined to its direct impact on my well-being. We might\nseparate two moves the contractualist can make here. They might argue\n(1) that the grounds for rejecting a principle need not be its impact\non my well-being; or (2) that it need not be its impact on\nmy well-being. Intuitively, what is objectionable about\nMary\u2019s behaviour is not anything to do with well-being, or with\nthe identity of future individuals. What is wrong is rather that Mary\nfails to show adequate respect for \u2018her future\nchild\u2019\u2014whoever that child may turn out to be. Even though\nthere is no particular individual who can be said to have been harmed,\nthere is still legitimate ground for a complaint that a principle\npermitting Mary\u2019s behaviour shows inadequate respect to future\npeople. The challenge for the Contractualist is to translate this\ncomplaint into one that can be made on behalf of the Winter Child.\n(For one recent attempt at such a translation, see Kumar 2003a, 2009.\nFor a critique, see Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 235)\n\nIn chapter 22 of On What Matters, Parfit argues that the\nimpersonalist restriction\u2014which rules out appeals to the\nimpersonal goodness or badness of outcomes\u2014leaves any form of\ncontractualism that incorporates the individualist restriction unable\nto respond to the non-identity problem.\n\nInstead, Parfit argues that contractualists should permit both\npersonal and impartial reasons as grounds for\nreasonable rejection. Impartial reasons, here, are grounded\nin the moral claims or the well-being of individuals. \u201cWe have\nsuch impartial reasons to care about the well-being of every\nindividual or person\u201d (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 238). The\ncrucial feature of impartial reasons is that they are not narrowly\nperson-affecting. In a different people choice, we have an impartial\nreason to maximise the well-being of future people\u2014even though\ndifferent possible futures include different groups of possible\npeople. \u201cSince [because of the non-identity problem] we cannot\nappeal to the personal reasons that are had by people who\nnever exist, we should appeal to the impartial\nreasons that are had by people who do exist\u201d (Parfit\n2011, volume 2, p. 240).\n\nAs with the individualist restriction, we might wonder whether the\nadmission of impartial reasons effectively abandons the spirit of\ncontractualism. If every present person has the same impartial\nreasons, and if those reasons cannot outweigh any individual\u2019s\npersonal reasons, then the resulting more impartial formulation of\ncontractualism will converge with rule consequentialism. But does this\nresult tell us anything interesting about Scanlon\u2019s\ncontractualism? More generally, will the resulting theory retain the\ndistinctive features of contractualism that appeal to those who are\nunsatisfied with familiar alternatives such as Kantian ethics or rule\nconsequentialism?\n\nDebates about future people also connect to other recent controversies\nwithin contractualism, especially the literature on risk. The divide\nbetween ex post and ex ante justification is especially significant in\nnon-identity cases, where ex post justification can be offered to\nparticular individuals while ex ante justification can only deal with\nperson types. Should contractualists give their person-affecting\nprinciples an ex post or ex ante interpretation? (Weinberg 2003 and\n2015 defends an ex post interpretation, albeit within a Rawlsian\nframework rather than a Scanlonian one; while Parfit 2017 clearly sets\nout the ex ante alternative.)\n\nAnother emerging debate is whether contractualism can deliver\nplausible verdicts in cases involving risks of human extinction. The\nprima facie problem for contractualism here is that, because the\noutcome where we fail to avoid imminent extinction contains no future\npeople at all, there is no (particular or representative) future\nperson who has the standing to reasonably reject principles\ninstructing present people to ignore extinction risks and focus\nentirely on meeting present needs.
