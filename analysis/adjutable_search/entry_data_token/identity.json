Various interrelated problems have been\nat the centre of discussion, but it is fair to say that recent work\nhas focussed particularly on the following areas: the notion of a\ncriterion of identity; the correct analysis of identity over time,\nand, in particular, the disagreement between advocates of perdurance\nand advocates of endurance as analyses of identity over time; the\nnotion of identity across possible worlds and the question of its\nrelevance to the correct analysis of de re modal discourse;\nthe notion of contingent identity; the question of whether the\nidentity relation is, or is similar to, the composition relation; and\nthe notion of vague identity. A radical position, advocated by Peter\nGeach, is that these debates, as usually conducted, are void for lack\nof a subject matter: the notion of absolute identity they\npresuppose has no application; there is only relative\nidentity. Another increasingly popular view is the one advocated by\nDavid Lewis: although the debates make sense they cannot genuinely be\ndebates about identity, since there are no philosophical problems\nabout identity. Identity is an utterly unproblematic notion. What\nthere are, are genuine problems which can be stated using the language\nof identity. But since these can be restated without the language of\nidentity they are not problems about identity. (For example, it is a\npuzzle, an aspect of the so-called \u201cproblem of personal\nidentity\u201d, whether the same person can have different\nbodies at different times. But this is just the puzzle whether\na person can have different bodies at different times. So\nsince it can be stated without the language of personal\n\u201cidentity\u201d, it is not a problem about personal\nidentity, but about personhood.)

Introduction\n\nTo say that things are identical is to say that they are the same.\n\u201cIdentity\u201d and \u201csameness\u201d mean the same; their\nmeanings are identical. However, they have more than one meaning. A\ndistinction is customarily drawn between qualitative and\nnumerical identity or sameness. Things with qualitative\nidentity share properties, so things can be more or less qualitatively\nidentical. Poodles and Great Danes are qualitatively identical because\nthey share the property of being a dog, and such properties as go\nalong with that, but two poodles will (very likely) have greater\nqualitative identity. Numerical identity requires absolute, or total,\nqualitative identity, and can only hold between a thing and itself.\nIts name implies the controversial view that it is the only identity\nrelation in accordance with which we can properly count (or number)\nthings: x and y are to be properly counted as one\njust in case they are numerically identical (Geach 1973).\n\nNumerical identity is our topic. As noted, it is at the centre of\nseveral philosophical debates, but to many seems in itself wholly\nunproblematic, for it is just that relation everything has to itself\nand nothing else \u2013 and what could be less problematic than that?\nMoreover, if the notion is problematic it is difficult to see how the\nproblems could be resolved, since it is difficult to see how a thinker\ncould have the conceptual resources with which to explain the concept\nof identity whilst lacking that concept itself. The basicness of the\nnotion of identity in our conceptual scheme, and, in particular, the\nlink between identity and quantification has been particularly noted\nby Quine (1964).\n2. The Logic of Identity\n\nNumerical identity can be characterised, as just done, as the relation\neverything has to itself and to nothing else. But this is circular,\nsince \u201cnothing else\u201d just means \u201cno numerically\nnon-identical thing\u201d. It can be defined, equally circularly\n(because quantifying over all equivalence relations including itself),\nas the smallest equivalence relation (an equivalence relation being\none which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, for example, having\nthe same shape). Other circular definitions are available. Usually it\nis defined as the equivalence relation (or: the reflexive relation)\nsatisfying Leibniz\u2019s Law, the principle of the indiscernibility\nof identicals, that if x is identical with y then\neverything true of x is true of y. Intuitively this\nis right, but only picks out identity uniquely if \u201cwhat is true\nof x\u201d is understood to include \u201cbeing identical\nwith x\u201d; otherwise it is too weak. Circularity is thus\nnot avoided. Nevertheless, Leibniz\u2019s Law appears to be crucial\nto our understanding of identity, and, more particularly, to our\nunderstanding of distinctness: we exhibit our commitment to it\nwhenever we infer from \u201cFa\u201d and\n\u201cNot-Fb\u201d that a is not identical with\nb. Strictly, what is being employed in such inferences is the\ncontrapositive of Leibniz\u2019s Law (if something true of a\nis false of b, a is not identical with b),\nwhich some (in the context of the discussion of vague identity) have\nquestioned, but it appears as indispensable to our grip on the concept\nof identity as Leibniz\u2019s Law itself.\n\nThe converse of Leibniz\u2019s Law, the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles, that if everything true of x is true of\ny, x is identical with y, is\ncorrespondingly trivial if \u201cwhat is true of x\u201d is\nunderstood to include \u201cbeing identical with x\u201d\n(as required if Leibniz\u2019s Law is to characterise identity\nuniquely among equivalence relations). But often it is read with\n\u201cwhat is true of x\u201d restricted, e.g., to\nqualitative, non-relational, properties of x. It then becomes\nphilosophically controversial. Thus it is debated whether a\nsymmetrical universe is possible, e.g., a universe containing two\nqualitatively indistinguishable spheres and nothing else (Black\n1952).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s Law has itself been subject to controversy in the\nsense that the correct explanation of apparent counter-examples has\nbeen debated. Leibniz\u2019s Law must be clearly distinguished from\nthe substitutivity principle, that if \u201ca\u201d and\n\u201cb\u201d are codesignators (if\n\u201ca=b\u201d is a true sentence of English)\nthey are everywhere substitutable salva veritate. This\nprinciple is trivially false. \u201cHesperus\u201d contains eight\nletters, \u201cPhosphorus\u201d contains ten, but Hesperus (the\nEvening Star) is Phosphorus (the Morning Star). Again, despite the\nidentity, it is informative to be told that Hesperus is Phosphorus,\nbut not to be told that Hesperus is Hesperus (\u201cOn Sense and\nReference\u201d in Frege 1969). Giorgione was so-called because of\nhis size, Barbarelli was not, but Giorgione was Barbarelli (Quine,\n\u201cReference and Modality\u201d, in 1963) . It is a necessary\ntruth that 9 is greater than 7, it is not a necessary truth that the\nnumber of planets is greater than 7, although 9 is the number of\nplanets. The explanation of the failure of the substitutivity\nprinciple can differ from case to case. In the first example, it is\nplausible to say that \u201c\u2018Hesperus\u2019 contains eight\nletters\u201d is not about Hesperus, but about the name, and the same\nis true, mutatis mutandis, of \u201c\u2018Phosphorus\u2019\ncontains ten letters\u201d. Thus the names do not have the same\nreferents in the identity statement and the predications. In the\nGiorgione/Barbarelli example this seems less plausible. Here the\ncorrect explanation is plausibly that \u201cis so-called because of\nhis size\u201d expresses different properties depending on the name\nit is attached to, and so expresses the property of being called\n\u201cBarbarelli\u201d because of his size when attached to\n\u201cBarbarelli\u201d and being called \u201cGiorgione\u201d\nbecause of his size when attached to \u201cGiorgione\u201d. It is\nmore controversial how to explain the Hesperus/Phosphorus and 9/the\nnumber of planets examples. Frege\u2019s own explanation of the\nformer was to assimilate it to the\n\u201cHesperus\u201d/\u201cPhosphorus\u201d case: in \u201cIt is\ninformative to be told that Hesperus is Phosphorus\u201d the names do\nnot stand for their customary referent but for their senses. A Fregean\nexplanation of the 9/number of planets example may also be offered:\n\u201cit is necessary that\u201d creates a context in which\nnumerical designators stand for senses rather than numbers.\n\nFor present purposes the important point to recognise is that, however\nthese counter-examples to the substitutivity principle are explained,\nthey are not counter-examples to Leibniz\u2019s Law, which says\nnothing about substitutivity of codesignators in any language.\n\nThe view of identity just put forward (henceforth \u201cthe classical\nview\u201d) characterises it as the equivalence relation which\neverything has to itself and to nothing else and which satisfies\nLeibniz\u2019s Law. These formal properties ensure that, within any\ntheory expressible by means of a fixed stock of one- or many-place\npredicates, quantifiers and truth-functional connectives, any two\npredicates which can be regarded as expressing identity (i.e., any\npredicates satisfying the two schemata \u201cfor all x,\nRxx\u201d and \u201cfor all x, for all y,\nRxy \u2192 (Fx \u2192 Fy)\u201d for any\none-place predicate in place of \u201cF\u201d) will be\nextensionally equivalent. They do not, however, ensure that any\ntwo-place predicate does express identity within a particular theory,\nfor it may simply be that the descriptive resources of the theory are\ninsufficiently rich to distinguish items between which the equivalence\nrelation expressed by the predicate holds (\u201cIdentity\u201d in\nGeach 1972).\n\nFollowing Geach, call a two-place predicate with these properties in a\ntheory an \u201cI-predicate\u201d in that theory. Relative to\nanother, richer, theory the same predicate, interpreted in the same\nway, may not be an I-predicate. If so it will not, and did not even in\nthe poorer theory, express identity. For example, \u201chaving the\nsame income as\u201d will be an I-predicate in a theory in which\npersons with the same income are indistinguishable, but not in a\nricher theory.\n\nQuine (1950) has suggested that when a predicate is an I-predicate in\na theory only because the language in which the theory is expressed\ndoes not allow one to distinguish items between which it holds, one\ncan reinterpret the sentences of the theory so that the I-predicate in\nthe newly interpreted theory does express identity. Every sentence\nwill have just the same truth-conditions under the new interpretation\nand the old, but the references of its subsentential parts will be\ndifferent. Thus, Quine suggests, if one has a language in which one\nspeaks of persons and in which persons of the same income are\nindistinguishable the predicates of the language may be reinterpreted\nso that the predicate which previously expressed having the same\nincome comes now to express identity. The universe of discourse\nnow consists of income groups, not people. The extensions of the\nmonadic predicates are classes of income groups, and, in general, the\nextension of an n-place predicate is a class of\nn-member sequences of income groups (Quine 1963:\n65\u201379). Any two-place predicate expressing an equivalence\nrelation could be an I-predicate relative to some sufficiently\nimpoverished theory, and Quine\u2019s suggestion will be applicable\nto any such predicate if it is applicable at all.\n\nBut it remains that it is not guaranteed that a two-place predicate\nthat is an I-predicate in the theory to which it belongs expresses\nidentity. In fact, no condition can be stated in a first-order\nlanguage for a predicate to express identity, rather than mere\nindiscernibility by the resources of the language. However, in a\nsecond-order language, in which quantification over all\nproperties (not just those for which the language contains predicates)\nis possible and Leibniz\u2019s Law is therefore statable, identity\ncan be uniquely characterised. Identity is thus not first-order, but\nonly second-order definable.\n3. Relative Identity\n\nThis situation provides the basis for Geach\u2019s radical contention\nthat the notion of absolute identity has no application and that there\nis only relative identity. This section contains a brief discussion of\nGeach\u2019s complex view. (For more details see the entry on\n relative identity,\n Deutsch 1997, Dummett 1981 and 1991, Hawthorne 2003 and Noonan 2017.)\nGeach maintains that since no criterion can be given by which a\npredicate expressing an I-predicate may be determined to express, not\nmerely indiscernibility relative to the language to which it belongs,\nbut also absolute indiscernibility, we should jettison the classical\nnotion of identity (1991). He dismisses the possibility of defining\nidentity in a second-order language on the ground of the paradoxical\nnature of unrestricted quantification over properties and aims his\nfire particularly at Quine\u2019s proposal that an I-predicate in a\nfirst-order theory may always be interpreted as expressing\nabsolute identity (even if such an interpretation is not\nrequired). Geach objects that Quine\u2019s suggestion leads\nto a \u201cBaroque Meinongian ontology\u201d and is inconsistent\nwith Quine\u2019s own expressed preference for \u201cdesert\nlandscapes\u201d (\u201cIdentity\u201d in Geach 1972: 245).\n\nWe may usefully state Geach\u2019s thesis using the terminology of\nabsolute and relative equivalence relations. Let us say that an\nequivalence relation R is absolute if and only if, if\nx stands in it to y, there cannot be some other\nequivalence relation S, holding between anything and either\nx or y, but not holding between x and\ny. If an equivalence relation is not absolute it is relative.\nClassical identity is an absolute equivalence relation. Geach\u2019s\nmain contention is that any expression for an absolute equivalence\nrelation in any possible language will have the null class as its\nextension, and so there can be no expression for classical identity in\nany possible language. This is the thesis he argues against Quine.\n\nGeach also maintains the sortal relativity of identity statements,\nthat \u201cx is the same A as y\u201d\ndoes not \u201csplit up\u201d into \u201cx is an\nA and y is an A and\nx=y\u201d. More precisely stated, what Geach denies\nis that whenever a term \u201cA\u201d is interpretable as a\nsortal term in a language L (a term which makes (independent)\nsense following \u201cthe same\u201d) the expression (interpretable\nas) \u201cx is the same A as y\u201d in\nlanguage L will be satisfied by a pair\n<x,y> only if the I-predicate of L is\nsatisfied by <x,y>. Geach\u2019s thesis of\nthe sortal relativity of identity thus neither entails nor is entailed\nby his thesis of the inexpressibility of identity. It is the sortal\nrelativity thesis that is the central issue between Geach and Wiggins\n(1967 and 1980). It entails that a relation expressible in the form\n\u201cx is the same A as y\u201d in a\nlanguage L, where \u201cA\u201d is a sortal term\nin L, need not entail indiscernibility even by the resources\nof L.\n\nGeach\u2019s argument against Quine exists in two versions, an\nearlier and a later.\n\nIn its earlier version the argument is merely that following\nQuine\u2019s suggestion to interpret a language in which some\nexpression is an I-predicate so that the I-predicate expresses\nclassical identity sins against a highly intuitive methodological\nprogramme enunciated by Quine himself, namely that as our knowledge\nexpands we should unhesitatingly expand our ideology, our stock of\npredicables, but should be much more wary about altering our ontology,\nthe interpretation of our bound name variables (1972: 243).\n\nGeach\u2019s argument is that in view of the mere possibility of\ncarving out of a language L, in which the relational\nexpressions, E1, E2,\nE3\u2026 are not I-predicates, sub-languages\nL1, L2,\nL3\u2026 in which these expressions are\nI-predicates, if Quine\u2019s suggested proposal of reinterpretation\nis possible for each Ln, the user of\nL will be committed to any number of entities not quantified\nover in L, namely, for each Ln,\nthose entities for which the I-predicate of\nLn (En)\ngives a criterion of absolute identity. This will be so because any\nsentence of L will retain its truth conditions in any\nLn to which it belongs, reinterpreted as\nQuine proposes, but \u201cof course, it is flatly inconsistent to say\nthat as a member of a large theory a sentence retains its\ntruth-conditions but not its ontological commitment\u201d\n(1973:299).\n\nThe crucial premiss of this argument is thus that sameness of\ntruth-conditions entails sameness of ontological commitment. But this\nis not true. The ontological commitments of a theory (according to\nQuine, whose notion this is) are those entities that must lie within\nthe domain of quantification of the theory if the theory is to be\ntrue; or, the entities the predicates of the theory have to be true of\nif the theory is to be true. A theory is not ontologically committed,\nwe may say, to whatever has to be in the universe for it to\nbe true, but only to whatever has to be in its universe for\nit to be true. Thus there is no argument from sameness of\ntruth-conditions to sameness of ontological commitments.\n\nThe later version of Geach\u2019s argument needs a different\nresponse. The difference between the earlier version and the later one\nis that in the later (to be found in Geach 1973) Geach\u2019s claim\nis not merely that Quine\u2019s thesis about possible\nreinterpretation has a consequence which is unpalatable, but that it\nleads to an out-and-out logical absurdity, the existence of what he\ncalls \u201cabsolute surmen\u201d (entities for which having the\nsame surname constitutes a criterion of absolute identity, i.e.,\nentails indiscernibility in all respects). Because Geach is now making\nthis stronger claim, the objection that his argument depends upon the\nincorrect assumption that sameness of truth-conditions entails\nsameness of ontological commitment is no longer relevant. In order to\nmake out his case Geach has to establish just two points. First, that\nthere are sentences of English supplemented by the predicate \u201cis\nthe same surman as\u201d (explained to mean \u201cis a man and has\nthe same surname as\u201d), which are evidently true and which,\nconsidered as sentences of that fragment of English in which \u201cis\nthe same surman as\u201d is an I-predicate, when this is interpreted\nin the way Quine suggests, can be true only if absolute surmen exist.\nAnd secondly, that the existence of absolute surmen is absurd.\n\nBut in the end Geach fails to establish these two points. Quine would\nsay that, for the fragment of English in question, the domain of the\nvariables can be considered to consist of classes of men with the same\nsurname and the predicates interpreted as holding of such classes.\nThus, the predicate \u201cis the same surman as\u201d will no longer\nbe true of pairs of men if we adopt Quine\u2019s suggestion\n(I am writing, remember in English, not in the fragment of English\nunder discussion), but rather of pairs of classes of men with the same\nsurname \u2013 these then will be Geach\u2019s \u201cabsolute\nsurmen\u201d. Now, Geach attempts to rule this out by the argument\nthat \u201cwhatever is a surman is by definition a man.\u201d But\nthis argument fails. The predicate \u201cis a man\u201d will also be\nin the language-fragment in which \u201cis the same surman as\u201d\nis the I-predicate; and so it, too, will, be reinterpreted, if we\nfollow Quine\u2019s suggestion, as holding of classes of men with the\nsame surname. Thus the sentence \u201cWhatever is a surman is a\nman\u201d will be true in the language fragment interpreted in\nQuine\u2019s way, just as it is in English as a whole. What will not\nbe true, however, is that whatever the predicate \u201cis a\nsurman\u201d is true of, as it occurs in the language-fragment\nreinterpreted in Quine\u2019s way, is a thing of which \u201cis\na man\u201d, as it occurs in English as a whole, is true of.\nBut Geach has no right to demand that this should be the case. Even\nso, this demand can be met. For the domain of the interpretation of\nthe language fragment in which \u201cis the same surman as\u201d is\nthe I-predicate can, in fact, be taken to consist of men, namely, to\nbe a class containing exactly one representative man for each class of\nmen with the same surname. Thus, as Geach says, absolute surmen will\nbe just some among men (1973, 100). Geach goes on, \u201cthere will,\nfor example, be just one surman with the surname \u2018Jones\u2019,\nbut if this is an absolute surman, and he is a certain man, then which\nof the Jones boys is he?\u201d But this question, which is, of\ncourse, only answerable using predicates which belong to the part of\nEnglish not included in the language fragment in which \u201cis the\nsame surman as\u201d is the I-predicate, is not an impossible one to\nanswer. It is merely that the answer will depend upon the particular\ninterpretation that the language fragment has, in fact, been given.\nGeach is, therefore not entitled to go on, \u201cSurely we have run\ninto an absurdity.\u201d It thus seems that his argument for the\nnon-existence of absolute identity fails.\n\nGeach\u2019s argument for his second thesis, that of the sortal\nrelativity of identity, is that it provides the best solution to a\nvariety of well known puzzles about identity and counting at a time\nand over time. The most well known puzzle is that of the cat on the\nmat, which comes in two versions.\n\nThe first version goes like this. (Wiggins 1968 contains the first\nappearance of this version in present-day philosophical literature; an\nequivalent puzzle is that of Dion and Theon, see Burke 1995.) Suppose\na cat, Tibbles, is sitting on a mat. Now consider that portion of\nTibbles that includes everything except its tail \u2013 its\n\u201ctail complement\u201d \u2013 and call it \u201cTib\u201d.\nTib is smaller than Tibbles so they are not identical. But what if we\nnow amputate the cat\u2019s tail? (A time-reversed, or\n\u201cgrowing\u201d, version can be considered in which a tail is\ngrafted on to a tailless cat; the same responses considered below will\nbe available, but may differ in relative plausibility.) Tibbles and\nTib will now coincide. If Tibbles is still a cat, it is hard to see by\nwhat criterion one could deny that Tib is a cat. Yet they are distinct\nindividuals, since they have different histories. But there is just\none cat on the mat. So they cannot be distinct cats. They must be the\nsame cat, even though they are distinct individuals; and so identity\nunder the sortal concept cat must be a relative identity\nrelation.\n\nThe second version (presented in Geach 1980, compare Unger 1980) goes\nas follows. Tibbles is sitting on the mat and is the only cat sitting\non the mat. But Tibbles has at least 1,000 hairs. Geach continues:\n\nNow let c be the largest continuous mass of feline tissue on\nthe mat. Then for any of our 1,000 cat-hairs, say\nhn, there is a proper part\ncn of c which contains precisely\nall of c except the hair hn; and\nevery such part cn differs in a\ndescribable way both from any other such part say\ncm, and from c as a whole.\nMoreover, fuzzy as the concept cat may be, it is clear that\nnot only is c a cat, but also any part\ncn is a cat:\ncn would clearly be a cat were the hair\nhn to be plucked out, and we cannot\nreasonably suppose that plucking out a hair generates a cat,\nso cn must already have been a cat.\n(Geach 1980, 215)\n\n\nThe conclusion, of course, is the same as in the previous version of\nthe argument: there is only one cat on the mat so all the distinct\nentities that qualify as cats must be the same cat.\n\nThis version of the argument can be resisted by insisting that the\nconcept of a cat is maximal, i.e. no proper part of a cat is a cat.\nThe first version may be resisted in a variety of ways. Some deny the\nexistence of the tail-complement at all (van Inwagen 1981, Olson\n1995); others deny that the tail-complement survives the amputation\n(Burke 1995). Another possibility is to say that certain of the\nhistorical and/or modal predicates possessed by Tibbles and not Tib\nare essential to being a cat, so that Tib is not (predicatively) a cat\n(Wiggins 1980). Again, it can be accepted that both Tib and Tibbles\nare cats, but deny that in counting them as one we are counting by\nidentity, rather, we are counting by \u201calmost identity\u201d\n(Lewis 1993). Another possibility is to accept that both Tib and\nTibbles are cats, but deny that they are distinct: rather\n\u201cTib\u201d and \u201cTibbles\u201d are two names of the same\ncat-stage (Hawley 2001, Sider 2001).\n\nThere is, then, no very compelling argument for Geach\u2019s sortal\nrelativity thesis to be based on such examples, given the variety of\nresponses available, some of which will be returned to below. On the\nother hand, no alternative solution to the puzzle of the cat on the\nmat stands out as clearly superior to the rest, or clearly superior to\nthe sortal relativity thesis as a solution. We should conclude that\nthis component of Geach\u2019s position, though not proven, is not\nrefuted either, and, possibly, that the linguistic data provide no\nbasis for a decision for or against.\n4. Criteria of identity\n\nA notion that Geach deploys extensively, and which is also in common\nuse by his opponents, is that of a criterion of identity, a standard\nby which identity is to be judged. This section will attempt to\nuntangle some of the complexities this notion involves.\n\nThe notion of a criterion of identity was introduced into\nphilosophical terminology by Frege (1884) and strongly emphasised by\nWittgenstein (1958). Exactly how it is to be interpreted and the\nextent of its applicability are still matters of debate.\n\nA considerable obstacle to understanding contemporary philosophical\nusage of the term, however, is that the notion does not seem to be a\nunitary one. In the case of abstract objects (the case discussed by\nFrege) the criterion of identity for Fs is thought of as an\nequivalence relation holding between objects distinct from\nFs. Thus the criterion of identity for directions is\nparallelism of lines, that is, the direction of line\na is identical with the direction of line b if and\nonly if line a is parallel to line b. The criterion\nof identity for numbers is equinumerosity of concepts, that\nis, the number of As is identical with the number of\nBs if and only if there are exactly as many As as\nBs. The relation between the criterion of identity for\nFs and the criterion of application for the concept\nF (the standard for the application of the concept to an\nindividual) is then said by some (Wright and Hale 2001) to be that to\nbe an F is just to be something for which questions of\nidentity and distinctness are to settled by appeal to the criterion of\nidentity for Fs. (Thus, when Frege went on to give an\nexplicit definition of numbers as extensions of concepts he appealed\nto it only to deduce what has come to be called Hume\u2019s Principle\n\u2013 his statement of his criterion of identity for numbers in\nterms of equinumerosity of concepts, and emphasised that he regarded\nthe appeal to extensions as inessential.) In the case of concrete\nobjects, however, things seem to stand differently. Often the\ncriterion of identity for a concrete object of type F is said\nto be a relation R such that for any Fs, x\nand y, x=y if and only if Rxy. In\nthis case the criterion of identity for Fs is not stated as a\nrelation between entities distinct from Fs and the criterion\nof identity cannot plausibly be thought of as determining the\ncriterion of application. Another example of the lack of uniformity in\nthe notion of a criterion of identity in contemporary philosophy is,\nin the case of concrete objects, a distinction customarily made\nbetween a criterion of diachronic identity and a criterion of\nsynchronic identity; the former taking the form \u201cx is\nat t the same F as y is at\nt\u2032 if and only if\u2026\u201d, where what fills the\ngap is some statement of a relation holding between objects x\nand y and times t and t\u2032. (In the\ncase of persons, for example, a candidate criterion of diachronic\nidentity is: x is at t the same person as y\nis at t\u2032 if and only if x at t is\npsychologically continuous with y at t\u2032.) A\ncriterion of synchronic identity, by contrast, will typically specify\nhow the parts of an F-thing existing at a time must be\nrelated, or how one F at a time is marked off from\nanother.\n\nOne way of bringing system into the discussion of criteria of identity\nis to make use of the distinction between one-level and two-level\ncriteria of identity (Williamson 1990, Lowe 2012). The Fregean\ncriteria of identity for directions and numbers are two-level. The\nobjects for which the criterion is given are distinct from, and can be\npictured as at a higher level than, the entities between which the\nrelation specified holds. A two-level criterion for the Fs\ntakes the form (restricting ourselves to examples in which the\ncriterial relation holds between objects):\n\nIf x is a G and y is a G then\nd(x) = d(y) iff Rxy\n\n\ne.g., If x and y are lines then the direction of\nx is identical with the direction of y iff\nx and y are parallel.\n\nA two-level criterion of identity is thus in the first place an\nimplicit definition of a function \u201cd(\u2009)\u201d\n(e.g., \u201cthe direction of\u201d) in terms of which the sortal\npredicate \u201cis an F\u201d can be defined (\u201cis a\ndirection\u201d can be defined as \u201cis the direction of some\nline\u201d). Consistently with the two-level criterion of identity\nstated several distinct functions may be the reference of the functor\n\u201cd\u201d. Hence, as emphasised by Lowe (1997: section\n6), two-level criteria of identity are neither definitions of\nidentity, nor of identity restricted to a certain sort (for identity\nis universal), nor even of the sortal terms denoting the sorts for\nwhich they provide criteria. They merely constrain, but not to\nuniqueness, the possible referents of the functor \u201cd\u201d they\nimplicitly define and they thus give a merely necessary condition for\nfalling under the sortal predicate \u201cis an F\u201d\n(where \u201cx is an F\u201d is explained to mean\n\u201cfor some y, x is identical with\nd(y)\u201d).\n\nOn the other hand, the criterion of identity for sets given by the\nAxiom of Extensionality (sets are the same iff they have the same\nmembers), unlike the criterion of identity for numbers given by\nHume\u2019s Principle, and Davidson\u2019s criterion of event\nidentity (events are the same iff they have the same causes and\neffects (\u201cThe Individuation of Events\u201d in his 1980)) are\none-level: the objects for which the criterion of identity is stated\nare the same as those between which the criterial relation obtains. In\ngeneral, a one-level criterion for objects of sort F takes\nthe form:\n\nIf x is an F and y is an F then\nx=y iff Rxy\n\n\nNot all criteria of identity can be two-level (on pain of infinite\nregress), and it is tempting to think that the distinction between\nobjects for which a two-level criterion is possible and those for\nwhich only a one-level criterion is possible coincides with that\nbetween abstract and concrete objects (and so, that a two-level\ncriterion for sets must be possible).\n\nHowever, a more general application of the two-level notion is\npossible. In fact, it can be applied to any type of object K,\nsuch that the criterion of identity for Ks can be thought of\nas an equivalence relation between a distinct type of object,\nK*s, but some such objects may intuitively be regarded as\nconcrete.\n\nHow general this makes its application is a matter of controversy. In\nparticular, if persisting things are thought of as composed of\n(instantaneous) temporal parts (see discussion below), the problem of\nsupplying a diachronic criterion of identity for persisting concrete\nobjects can be regarded as the problem of providing a two-level\ncriterion. But if persisting things are not thought of in this way\nthen not all persisting things can be provided with two-level\ncriteria. (Though some can. For example, it is quite plausible that\nthe criterion of identity over time for persons should be thought of\nas given by a relation between bodies.)\n\nAs noted by Lowe (1997) and Wright and Hale (2001) any two-level\ncriterion can be restated in a one-level form (though, of course, not\nconversely). For example, to say that the direction of line a\nis identical with the direction of line b if and only if line\na is parallel to line b is to say that directions\nare the same if and only if the lines they are of are parallel, which\nis the form of a one-level criterion. A way of unifying the various\ndifferent ways of talking of criteria of identity is thus to take as\nthe paradigmatic form of a statement of a criterion of identity a\nstatement of the form: for any x, for any y, if\nx is an F and y is an F then\nx=y if and only if Rxy (Lowe 1989,\n1997).\n\nIf the notion is interpreted in this way then the relation between the\ncriterion of identity and the criterion of application will be that of\none-way determination. The criterion of identity will be determined\nby, but not determine, the criterion of application.\n\nFor, in general, a one-level criterion of identity for Fs as\nexplained above is equivalent to the conjunction of:\n\nIf x is an F then Rxx\n and\n\n\nIf x is an F then if y is an F and\nRxy then x=y\n\n\nEach of these gives a merely necessary condition for being an\nF. And the second says something about Fs which is\nnot true of everything only if \u201cRxy\u201d does not\nentail \u201cx=y\u201d\n\nTogether these are equivalent to the proposition that every F\nis the F \u201cR-related\u201d to it. By its form\nthis states a merely necessary condition for being a thing of sort\n\u201cF\u201d. The one-level criterion of identity thus\nagain merely specifies a necessary condition of being an object of\nsort \u201cF\u201d.\n\nHence, once the necessary and sufficient conditions of being an\n\u201cF\u201d are laid down, no further stipulation is\nrequired of a criterion of \u201cF\u201d-identity, whether\none-level or two-level.\n\nThis conclusion is, of course, in agreement with Lewis\u2019s view\nthat there are no genuine problems about identity as such (Lewis 1986,\nCh. 4), but it is in tension with the thought that sortal concepts, as\ndistinct from adjectival concepts, are to be characterised by their\ninvolvement of criteria of identity as well as criteria of\napplication.\n\nA conception of identity criteria which allows this characterisation\nof the notion of a sortal concept, and which has so far not been\nmentioned, is that of Dummett (1981). Dummett denies that a criterion\nof identity must always be regarded as a criterion of identity for a\ntype of object. There is a basic level, he suggests, at which\nwhat a criterion of identity is a criterion of, is the truth of a\nstatement in which no objects are referred to. Such a\nstatement can be expressed using demonstratives and pointing gestures,\nfor instance, by saying \u201cThis is the same cat as that\u201d,\npointing first to a head and then a tail. In such a statement, which\nhe calls a statement of identification, in Dummett\u2019s view, there\nneed be no reference to objects made by the use of the demonstratives,\nany more than reference is made to any object in a feature-placing\nsentence like \u201cIt\u2019s hot here\u201d. A statement of\nidentification is merely, as it were, a feature-placing relational\nstatement, like \u201cThis is darker than that\u201d. A grasp of a\nsortal concept F involves both grasp of the truth-conditions\nof such statements of identification involving\n\u201cF\u201d and also grasp of the truth-conditions of\nwhat Dummett calls \u201ccrude predications\u201d involving\n\u201cF\u201d, statements of the form \u201cthis is\nF\u201d, in which the demonstrative again does not serve to\nrefer to any object. Adjectival terms, which have only a criterion of\napplication and no criterion of identity, are ones which have a use in\nsuch crude predications, but no use in statements of identification.\nSortal terms, as just noted, have a use in both contexts, and sortal\nterms may share their criteria of application but differ in their\ncriteria of identity since grasp of the truth-conditions of the crude\npredication \u201cThis is F\u201d does not determine grasp\nof the truth-conditions of the statement of identification \u201cThis\nis the same F as that\u201d (thus I can know when it is\nright to say \u201cThis is a book\u201d without knowing when it is\nright to say \u201cThis is the same book as that\u201d).\n\nOn Dummett\u2019s account, then, it may be possible to accept that\nwhenever a criterion of identity for a type of object is to\nbe given it must be (expressible as) a two-level criterion, which\nimplicitly defines a functor. Essentially one-level criteria\n(one-level criteria not expressible in a two-level form) are\nredundant, determined by specifications of necessary and sufficient\nconditions for being objects of the sorts in question.\n5. Identity over time\n\nAs noted in the last section, another source of apparent disunity in\nthe concept of a criterion of identity is the distinction made between\nsynchronic criteria of identity and diachronic criteria of identity.\nCriteria of identity can be employed synchronically, as in the\nexamples just given, to determine whether two coexistent objects are\nparts of the same object of a sort, or diachronically, to determine\nidentity over time. But as Lowe notes (2012: 137), it is an error to\nsuppose that diachronic identity and synchronic identity are different\nkinds of identity and so demand different kinds of identity criteria.\nWhat then is a criterion of identity over time?\n\nIdentity over time is itself a controversial notion, however, because\ntime involves change. Heraclitus argued that one could not bathe in\nthe same river twice because new waters were ever flowing in. Hume\nargued that identity over time was a fiction we substitute for a\ncollection of related objects. Such views can be seen as based on a\nmisunderstanding of Leibniz\u2019s Law: if a thing changes something\nis true of it at the later time that is not true of it at the earlier,\nso it is not the same. The answer is that what is true of it at the\nlater time is, say, \u201cbeing muddy at the later time\u201d, which\nwas always true of it; similarly, what is true of it at the earlier\ntime, suitably expressed, remains true of it. But the question remains\nhow to characterise identity through time and across change given that\nthere is such a thing.\n\nOne topic which has always loomed large in this debate has been the\nissue (in the terminology of Lewis 1986, Ch. 4) of perdurance\nversus endurance. (Others, for which there is no space for\ndiscussion here, include the debate over Ship of Theseus and\nreduplication or fission problems and associated issues about\n\u201cbest candidate\u201d or \u201cno rival candidate\u201d\naccounts of identity over time, and the debate over Humean\nsupervenience \u2013 see articles on relative identity, personal\nidentity, Hawley 2001 and Sider 2001.)\n\nAccording to one view, material objects persist by having temporal\nparts or stages, which exist at different times and are to be\ndistinguished by the times at which they exist \u2013 this is known\nas the view that material objects perdure. Other philosophers deny\nthat this is so; according to them, when a material object exists at\ndifferent times, it is wholly present at those times, for it has no\ntemporal parts, but only spatial parts, which likewise are wholly\npresent at the different times they exist. This is known as the view\nthat material objects endure.\n\nPerdurance theorists, as Quine puts it, reject the point of view\ninherent in the tenses of our natural language. From that point of\nview persisting things endure and change through time, but do not\nextend through time, but only through space. Thus persisting\nthings are to be sharply distinguished from events or processes, which\nprecisely do extend through time. One way of describing the position\nof the perdurance theorist, then, is to say that he denies the\nexistence of a distinct ontological category of persisting\nthings, or substances. Thus, Quine writes, \u201cphysical\nobjects, conceived thus four-dimensionally in space-time, are not to\nbe distinguished from events, or, in the concrete sense of the term,\nprocesses. Each comprises simply the content, however heterogeneous,\nof some portion of space-time, however disconnected and\ngerrymandered\u201d (1960:171).\n\nIn recent controversy two arguments have been at the centre of the\nendurance/perdurance debate, one employed by perdurance theorists and\nthe other by endurance theorists (for other arguments and issues see\nthe separate article on temporal parts, Hawley 2001 and Sider\n2001).\n\nAn argument for perdurance which has been hotly debated is due to\nDavid Lewis (1986). If perdurance is rejected, the ascription of dated\nor tensed properties to objects must be regarded as assertions of\nirreducible relations between objects and times. If Tabby is\nfat on Monday, that is a relation between Tabby and Monday, and if\nperdurance is rejected it is an irreducible relation between Tabby and\nMonday. According to perdurance theory, however, while it is still, of\ncourse, a relation between Tabby and Monday it is not irreducible; it\nholds between Tabby and Monday because the temporal part of Tabby on\nMonday, Tabby-on-Monday, is intrinsically fat. If perdurance is\nrejected, however, no such intrinsic possessor of the property of\nfatness can be recognised: Tabby\u2019s fatness on Monday must be\nregarded as an irreducible state of affairs.\n\nAccording to Lewis, this consequence of the rejection of the\nperdurance theory is incredible. Whether he is right about this is the\nsubject of intense debate (Haslanger 2003).\n\nEven if Lewis is right, however, the perdurance theory may still be\nfound wanting, since it does not secure the most commonsensical\nposition: that fatness is a property of a cat (Haslanger\n2003). According to perdurance theory, rather, it is a property of a\n(temporal) cat part. Those known as stage theorists (Hawley 2001,\nSider 2001), accepting the ontology of perdurance theory, but\nmodifying its semantics, offer a way to secure this desirable result.\nEvery temporal part of a cat is a cat, they say, so\nTabby-on-Monday (which is what we refer to by \u201cTabby\u201d, on\nMonday) is a cat and is fat, just as we would like. Stage theorists\nhave to pay a price for this advantage over perdurance theory,\nhowever. For they must accept either that our reports of the\ncross-temporal number of cats are not always reports of the counting\nof cats (as when I say, truly, that I have only ever owned three cats)\nor that two cat-stages (cats) may be counted as one and the\nsame cat, so that counting cats is not always counting in accordance\nwith absolute identity.\n\nAn argument against the perdurance theory that has been the focus of\ninterest is one presented in various guises by a number of writers,\nincluding Wiggins (1980), Thomson (1983) and van Inwagen (1990).\nApplied to persons (it can equally well be applied to other persisting\nthings), it asserts that persons have different properties, in\nparticular, different modal properties, from the summations of\nperson-stages with which the perdurance theory identifies them. Thus,\nby Leibniz\u2019s Law, this identification must be mistaken. As David\nWiggins states the argument: \u201cAnything that is a part of a\nLesniewskian sum [a mereological whole defined by its parts] is\nnecessarily part of it\u2026But no person or normal material object\nis necessarily in the total state that will correspond to the\nperson- or object-moment postulated by the theory under\ndiscussion\u201d (1980: 168).\n\nTo elaborate a little. I might have died when I was five years old.\nBut that maximal summation of person-stages which, according to\nperdurance theory, is me and has a temporal extent of at\nleast fifty years, could not have had a temporal extent of a mere five\nyears. So I cannot be such a summation of stages.\n\nThis argument illustrates the interdependence of the various topics\ndiscussed under the rubric of identity. Whether it is valid, of\ncourse, depends on the correct analysis of modal predication, and, in\nparticular, on whether it should be analysed in terms of\n\u201cidentity across possible worlds\u201d or in terms of Lewisian\ncounterpart theory. This is the topic of the next section.\n6. Identity across possible worlds\n\nIn the interpretation of modal discourse recourse is often made to the\nidea of \u201cidentity across possible worlds\u201d. If modal\ndiscourse is interpreted in this way it becomes natural to regard a\nstatement ascribing a modal property to an individual as asserting the\nidentity of that individual across worlds: \u201cSarah might\nhave been a millionaire\u201d, on this view, asserts that there is a\npossible world in which an individual identical with Sarah is a\nmillionaire. \u201cSarah could not have been a\nmillionaire\u201d asserts that in any world in which an individual\nidentical with Sarah exists that individual is not a\nmillionaire.\n\nHowever, though this is perhaps the most natural way to interpret\nde re modal statements (once it has been accepted that the\napparatus of possible worlds is to be used as an interpretative tool),\nthere are well-known difficulties that make the approach\nproblematic.\n\nFor example, it seems reasonable to suppose that a complex artefact\nlike a bicycle could have been made of different parts. On the other\nhand, it does not seem right that the same bicycle could have been\nconstructed out of completely different parts.\n\nBut now consider a series of possible worlds, beginning with the\nactual world, each containing a bicycle just slightly different from\nthe one in the previous world, the last world in the sequence being\none in which there is a bicycle composed of completely different parts\nfrom the one in the actual world. One cannot say that each bicycle is\nidentical with the one in the neighbouring world, but not identical\nwith the corresponding bicycle in distant worlds, since identity is\ntransitive. Hence it seems one must either adopt an extreme\nmereological essentialism, according to which no difference of parts\nis possible for an individual, or reject the interpretation of de\nre modal discourse as asserting identity across possible\nworlds.\n\nThis and other problems with cross-world identity suggest that some\nother weaker relation, of similarity or what David Lewis calls\ncounterparthood, should be employed in a possible world analysis of\nmodal discourse. Since similarity is not transitive this allows us to\nsay that the bicycle might have had some different parts without\nhaving to say that it might have been wholly different. On the other\nhand, such a substitution does not seem unproblematic, for a claim\nabout what I might have done hardly seems, at first sight, to\nbe correctly interpretable as a claim about what someone else\n(however similar to me) does in another possible world (Kripke 1972\n[1980], note 13).\n\nAn assessment of the counterpart theoretic analysis is vital not just\nto understanding modal discourse, however, but also to getting to the\ncorrect account of identity over time. For, as we saw, the argument\nagainst perdurance theory outlined at the end of the last section\ndepends on the correct interpretation of modal discourse. In fact, it\nis invalid on a counterpart theoretic analysis which allows different\ncounterpart relations (different similarity relations) to be invoked\naccording to the sense of the singular term which is the subject of\nthe de re modal predication (Lewis 1986, Ch. 4), since the\ncounterpart relation relevant to the assessment of a de re\nmodal predication with a singular term whose sense determines that it\nrefers to a person will be different from that relevant to the\nassessment of a de re modal predication with a singular term\nwhose sense determines that it refers to a sum of person-stages.\n\u201cI might have existed for only five years\u201d means on the\nLewisian account \u201cThere is a person in some possible world\nsimilar to me in those respects important to personhood who exists for\nonly five years\u201d; \u201cThe maximal summation of person stages\nof which this current stage is a stage might have existed for only\nfive years\u201d means \u201cThere is a summation of person stages\nsimilar to this one in those respects important to the status of an\nentity as a summation of stages which exists for only five\nyears\u201d. Since the two similarity relations in question are\ndistinct the first modal statement may be true and the second false\neven if I am identical with the sum of stages in question.\n\nCounterpart theory is also significant to the topic of identity over\ntime in another way, since it provides the analogy to which the stage\ntheorist (who regards all everyday reference as reference to momentary\nstages rather than to perdurers) appeals to explain de re\ntemporal predication. Thus, according to the stage theorist, just as\n\u201cI might have been fat\u201d does not require the existence of\na possible world in which an object identical with me is fat, but only\nthe existence of a world in which a (modal) counterpart of me is fat,\nso \u201cI used to be fat\u201d does not require the existence of a\npast time at which someone identical with (the present momentary stage\nwhich is) me was fat, but only the existence of a past time at which a\n(temporal) counterpart of me was fat. The problem of identity over\ntime for things of a kind, for stage theorists, is just the problem of\ncharacterizing the appropriate temporal counterpart relation for\nthings of that kind.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of the topic, see the entry\n transworld identity.\n Whether de re modal discourse is to be interpreted in terms\nof identity across possible worlds or counterpart theoretically (or in\nsome other way entirely) is also relevant to our next topic, that of\ncontingent identity.\n7. Contingent identity\n\nBefore Kripke\u2019s writings (1972 [1980]), it seemed a platitude\nthat statements of identity could be contingent \u2013 when they\ncontained two terms differing in sense but identical in reference and\nso were not analytic. Kripke challenged this platitude, though, of\ncourse, he did not reject the possibility of contingent statements of\nidentity. But he argued that when the terms flanking the sign of\nidentity were what he called rigid designators, an identity statement,\nif true at all, had to be necessarily true, but need not be knowable\na priori, as an analytic truth would be. Connectedly, Kripke\nargued that identity and distinctness were themselves necessary\nrelations: if an object is identical with itself it is necessarily so,\nand if it is distinct from another it is necessarily so.\n\nKripke\u2019s arguments were very persuasive, but there are examples\nthat suggest that his conclusion is too sweeping \u2013 that even\nidentity statements containing rigid designators can be, in a sense,\ncontingent. The debate over contingent identity is concerned with the\nassessment and proper analysis of these examples.\n\nOne of the earliest examples is provided by Gibbard (1975). Consider a\nstatue, Goliath, and the clay, Lumpl, from which it is composed.\nImagine that Lumpl and Goliath coincide in their spatiotemporal\nextent. It is tempting to conclude that they are identical. But they\nmight not have been. Goliath might have been rolled into a ball and\ndestroyed; Lumpl would have continued to exist. The two would have\nbeen distinct. Thus it seems that the identity of Lumpl and Goliath,\nif admitted, must be acknowledged as merely contingent.\n\nOne reaction to this argument available to the convinced Kripkean is\nsimply to deny that Lumpl and Goliath are identical. But to accept\nthis is to accept that purely material entities, like statues and\nlumps of clay, of admittedly identical material constitution at all\ntimes, may nonetheless be distinct, though distinguished only by\nmodal, dispositional or counterfactual properties. To many, however,\nthis seems highly implausible, which provides the strength of the\nargument for contingent identity. Another way of thinking of this\nmatter is in terms of the failure of the supervenience of the\nmacroscopic on the microscopic. If Lumpl is distinct from Goliath then\na far distant duplicate of Lumpl, Lumpl*, coincident with a statue\nGoliath*, though numerically distinct from Goliath will be\nmicroscopically indistinguishable from Goliath in\nall general respects, relational as well as non-relational,\npast and future as well as present, even modal and dispositional as\nwell as categorical, but will be macroscopically\ndistinguishable in general respects, since it will not be a statue,\nand will have modal properties, such as the capacity to survive\nradical deformation in shape, which no statue possesses.\n\nDavid Lewis (in \u201cCounterparts of Persons and their\nBodies\u201d, 1971) suggests that the identity of a person with his\nbody (assuming the person and the body, like Goliath and Lumpl, are at\nall times coincident) is contingent, since bodily interchange is a\npossibility. He appeals to counterpart theory, modified to allow a\nvariety of counterpart relations, to explain this. Contingent identity\nthen makes sense, since \u201cI and my body might not have been\nidentical\u201d now translates into counterpart theory as\n\u201cThere is a possible world, w, a unique personal\ncounterpart x in w of me and a unique bodily\ncounterpart y in w of my body, such that x\nand y are not identical\u201d.\n\nWhat is crucial to making sense of contingent identity is an\nacceptance that modal predicates are inconstant in denotation (that\nis, stand for different properties when attached to different singular\nterms or different quantifying expressions). Counterpart theory\nprovides one way of explaining this inconstancy, but is not\nnecessarily the only way (Gibbard 1975, Noonan 1991, 1993). However,\nwhether the examples of contingent identity in the literature are\npersuasive enough to make it reasonable to accept the certainly\ninitially surprising idea that modal predications are inconstant in\ndenotation is still a matter of considerable controversy.\n\nFinally, in this section, it is worth noting explicitly the\ninterdependence of the topics under discussion: only if the\npossibility of contingent identity is secured, by counterpart theory\nor some other account of de re modality which does not\nstraightforwardly analyse de re modal predication in terms of\nidentity across possible worlds, can perdurance theory (or stage\ntheory) as an account of identity across time be sustained against the\nmodal arguments of Wiggins, Thomson and van Inwagen.\n8. Composition as Identity\n\nA thesis that has a long pedigree but has only recently been gathering\nattention in the contemporary literature is the \u201cComposition as\nIdentity\u201d thesis. The thesis comes in a weak and a strong form.\nIn its weak form the thesis is that the mereological composition\nrelation is analogous in a number of important ways to the identity\nrelation and so deserves to be called a kind of identity. In\nits strong form the thesis is that the composition relation is\nstrictly identical with the identity relation, viz. that the parts of\na whole are literally (collectively) identical with the whole itself.\nThe strong thesis was considered by Plato in Parmenides and\nversions of the thesis have been discussed by many historical figures\nsince (Harte 2002, Normore and Brown 2014). The progenitor of the\nmodern version of the thesis is Baxter (1988a, 1988b, 2001) but it is\nmost often discussed under the formulation of it given by Lewis\n(1991), who first considers the strong thesis before rejecting it in\nfavour of the weak thesis.\n\nBoth the strong and the weak versions of the thesis are motivated by\nthe fact that there is an especially intimate relation between a whole\nand its parts (a whole is \u201cnothing over and above\u201d its\nparts), buttressed by claims that identity and composition are alike\nin various ways. Lewis (1991: 85) makes five likeness claims:\n\nOntological Innocence. If one believes that some object\nx exists, one does not gain a commitment to a further object\nby believing that something identical with x exists.\nLikewise, if one believes that some objects x1,\nx2, \u2026, xn\nexist, one does not gain a commitment to a further object by claiming\nthat something composed of x1,\nx2, \u2026, xn\nexists.\nAutomatic Existence. If some object x exists,\nthen it automatically follows that something identical with x\nexists. Likewise, if some objects x1,\nx2, \u2026, xn\nexist, then it automatically follows that something composed of\nx1, x2, \u2026,\nxn exists.\nUnique Composition. If something y is identical\nwith x, then anything identical with x is identical\nwith y, and anything identical with y is identical\nwith x. Likewise, if some things y1,\ny2, \u2026, yn\ncompose x, then any things that compose x are\nidentical with y1, y2,\n\u2026, yn, and anything identical with\nx is composed of y1,\ny2, \u2026,\nyn.\nExhaustive Description. If y is identical with\nx, then an exhaustive description of y is an\nexhaustive description of x, and vice versa. Likewise, if\ny1, y2, \u2026,\nyn compose x, then an exhaustive\ndescription of y1, y2,\n\u2026, yn is an exhaustive description\nof x, and vice versa.\nSame Location. If y is identical with\nx, then necessarily, x and y fill the same\nregion of spacetime. Likewise, if y1,\ny2, \u2026, yn\ncompose x, then necessarily, y1,\ny2, \u2026, yn and\nx fill the same region of spacetime.\n\n\nClearly not all will agree with each of Lewis\u2019s likeness claims.\nAnyone who denies unrestricted mereological composition, for example,\nwill deny 2. And the defender of strong pluralism in the material\nconstitution debate (i.e. one who defends the view that there can be\nall-time coincident entities) will deny 3. And some endurantists who\nthink that ordinary material objects can have distinct parts at\ndistinct times will deny 5. But there is a more general problem with\n1, as van Inwagen has made clear (1994: 213). Consider a world w1 that\ncontains just two simples s1 and s2. Now consider the difference\nbetween someone p1 who believes that s1 and s2 compose something and\nsomeone p2 who does not. Ask: how many objects do p1 and p2 believe\nthere to be in w1? The answer, it seems, is that p1 believes that\nthere are three things and p2 only two. So how can a commitment to the\nexistence of fusions be ontologically innocent? One recent suggestion\nis that although a commitment to the existence of fusions is not\nontologically innocent, it almost is: to commit oneself to\nfusions is to commit oneself to further entities, but because they are\nnot fundamental entities they are not ones that matter for the purpose\nof theory choice (Cameron 2014, Schaffer 2008, Williams 2010, and see\nalso Hawley 2014).\n\nIf one believes Lewis\u2019s likeness claims one will be tempted by\nat least the weak Composition as Identity thesis. If composition is a\ntype of identity this gives some kind of explanation of why the\nparallels between the two hold. But the strong thesis, that the\ncomposition relation is the identity relation, gives a fuller\nexplanation. So why not hold the strong thesis? Because, many think,\nthere are additional challenges that face anyone who wishes to defend\nthe strong thesis.\n\nThe classical identity relation is one that can only have single\nobjects as relata (as in: \u201cBillie Holiday = Eleanora\nFagan\u201d). If we adopt a language that allows the formation of\nplural terms we can unproblematically define a plural identity\nrelation that holds between pluralities of objects too. Plural\nidentity statements such as \u201cthe hunters are identical with the\ngatherers\u201d are understood to mean that for all x,\nx is one of the hunters iff x is one of the\ngatherers. But, according to the strong Composition as Identity\nthesis, there can also be true hybrid identity statements that relate\npluralities and single objects. That is, sentences such as \u201cthe\nbricks = the wall\u201d are taken by the defender of strong\nComposition as Identity to be well-formed sentences that express\nstrict identities.\n\nThe first challenge facing the defender of the strong thesis is the\nleast troublesome. It is the syntactic problem that hybrid identity\nstatements are ungrammatical in English (Van Inwagen, 1994: 211).\nWhilst \u201cBillie Holiday is identical with Eleanora\nFagan\u201d and \u201cthe hunters are identical with the\ngatherers\u201d are well-formed, it seems that \u201cthe bricks are\nidentical with the wall\u201d is not. However, there is in fact some\ndoubt about whether hybrid identity statements are ungrammatical in\nEnglish, and some have pointed out that this is anyway a mere\ngrammatical artefact of English that is not present in other languages\n(e.g. Norwegian and Hungarian). So it seems that the most this\nchallenge calls for is a mild form of grammatical revisionism. And we\nhave, at any rate, formal languages that allow hybrid constructions to\nbe made in which to express the claims made by the defender of the\nstrong Composition as Identity thesis. (Sider 2007, Cotnoir 2013) (NB\nThe claims regarding Norwegian and Hungarian are to be found in these\ntwo papers.)\n\nThe second challenge is more troublesome. It is the semantic problem\nof providing coherent truth-conditions for hybrid identity statements.\nThe standard way to provide the truth-conditions for the classical\nidentity relation is to say that an identity statement of the form\n\u201ca=b\u201d is true iff\n\u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d have the same\nreferents. But this account clearly does not work for hybrid identity\nstatements, for there is no (single) referent for a plural term.\nMoreover, the standard way of giving the truth-conditions for plural\nidentity statements (mentioned above) does not work for hybrid\nidentity statements either. To say that \u201cx is one of\nthe ys\u201d is to say that x is (classically)\nidentical with one of the things in the plurality, i.e., that\nx is identical with y1, or identical with\ny2\u2026 or identical with\nyn. But then \u201cthe bricks = the\nwall\u201d is true only if the wall is (classically) identical with\none of the bricks, i.e. with b1, or with\nb2\u2026 or with\nbn, which it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe third challenge is the most troublesome of all. In section 2 it\nwas noted that Leibniz\u2019s Law (and its contrapositive) appear to\nbe crucial to our understanding of identity and distinctness. But it\nseems that the defender of strong Composition as Identity must deny\nthis. After all, the bricks are many, but the wall is one. The onus is\nthus on the defender of strong Composition as Identity to explain why\nwe should think the \u201care\u201d in hybrid identity statements\nreally expresses the relation of identity.\n\nThe second and the third challenges have been thought by many to be\ninsurmountable (Lewis, for example, rejects strong Composition as\nIdentity on the basis of them). But, in recent semantic work in this\narea, accounts have emerged that promise to answer both challenges.\n(Wallace 2011a, 2011b, Cotnoir 2013). Whether they do so, however,\nremains to be seen.\n9. Vague identity\n\nLike the impossibility of contingent identity, the impossibility of\nvague identity appears to be a straightforward consequence of the\nclassical concept of identity (Evans 1978, see also Salmon 1982). For\nif a is only vaguely identical with b, something is\ntrue of it \u2013 that it is only vaguely identical with b\n\u2013 that is not true of b, so, by Leibniz\u2019s Law, it\nis not identical with b at all. Of course, there are vague\nstatements of identity \u2013 \u201cPrinceton is Princeton\nBorough\u201d (Lewis 1988) \u2013 but the conclusion appears to\nfollow that such vagueness is only possible when one or both of the\nterms flanking the sign of identity is an imprecise designator.\nRelatedly, it appears to follow that identity itself must be a\ndeterminate relation.\n\nBut some examples suggest that this conclusion is too sweeping \u2013\nthat even identity statements containing precise designators may be,\nin some sense, indeterminate. Consider Everest and some precisely\ndefined hunk of rock, ice and snow, Rock, of which it is indeterminate\nwhether its boundaries coincide with those of Everest. It is tempting\nto think that \u201cEverest\u201d and \u201cRock\u201d are both\nprecise designators (if \u201cEverest\u201d is not, is anything?\n(Tye 2000)) and that \u201cEverest is Rock\u201d is nonetheless in\nsome sense indeterminate.\n\nThose who take this view have to respond to Evans\u2019s original\nargument, about which there has been intense debate (see separate\narticle on vagueness, Edgington 2000, Lewis 1988, Parsons 2000, van\nInwagen 1990, Williamson 2002 and 2003), but also to more recent\nvariants. There is no space to go into these matters here, but one\nparticular variant of the Evans argument worth briefly noting is given\nby Hawley (2001). Alpha and Omega are (two?) people, the first of whom\nsteps into van Inwagen\u2019s (1990) fiendish cabinet which disrupts\nwhatever features are relevant to personal identity, and the second of\nwhom then steps out:\n\n(1) It is indeterminate whether Alpha steps out of the cabinet\n\n\n(2) Alpha is such that it is indeterminate whether she steps out of\nthe cabinet\n\n(3) It is not indeterminate whether Omega steps out of the cabinet\n\n(4) Omega is not such that it is indeterminate whether she steps out\nof the cabinet\n\n(5) Alpha is not identical to Omega.\n\n\nThis argument differs from the standard version of Evans\u2019s\nargument by not depending upon identity-involving properties (e.g.\nbeing such that it is indeterminate whether she is Omega) to establish\ndistinctness, and this removes some sources of controversy. Others, of\ncourse, remain.\n\nThe debate over vague identity is too vast to survey here, but to\nfinish this section we can relate this debate to the previously\ndiscussed debate about identity over time.\n\nFor some putative cases of vagueness in synchronic identity it seems\nreasonable to accept the conclusion of Evans\u2019s argument and\nlocate the indeterminacy in language (see the \u201cReply\u201d by\nShoemaker in Shoemaker and Swinburne 1984 for the following example).\nA structure consists of two halls, Alpha Hall and Beta Hall, linked by\na flimsy walkway, Smith is located in Alpha Hall, Jones in Beta Hall.\nThe nature of the structure is such that the identity statement\n\u201cThe building in which Smith is located is the building in which\nJones is located\u201d is neither true nor false because it is\nindeterminate whether Alpha Hall and Beta Hall count as two distinct\nbuildings or merely as two parts of one and the same building. Here it\nis absolutely clear what is going on. The term \u201cbuilding\u201d\nis vague in a way that makes it indeterminate whether it applies to\nthe whole structure or just to the two halls. Consequently, it is\nindeterminate what \u201cthe building in which Smith is\nlocated\u201d and \u201cthe building in which Jones is\nlocated\u201d denote.\n\nPerdurance theorists, who assimilate identity over time to identity\nover space, can accommodate vagueness in identity over time in the\nsame way. In Hawley\u2019s example they can say that there are\nseveral entities present: one that exists before and after the\nidentity-obscuring occurrences in the cabinet, one that exists only\nbefore, and one that exists only after. It is indeterminate which of\nthese is a person and so it is indeterminate what the singular terms\n\u201cAlpha\u201d and \u201cOmega\u201d refer to.\n\nThis involves taking on an ontology that is larger than we ordinarily\nrecognise, but that is not uncongenial to the perdurance theorist, who\nis happy to regard any, however spatiotemporally disconnected, region\nas containing a physical object (Quine 1960:171).\n\nBut what of endurance theorists?\n\nOne option for them is to adopt the same response and to accept a\nmultiplicity of entities partially coinciding in space and time where\nto common sense there seems to be only one. But this is to give up on\none of the major advantages claimed by the endurance theorist, his\nconsonance with common sense.\n\nThe endurance theorist has several other options. He may simply deny\nthe existence of the relevant entities and restrict his ontology to\nentities which are not complex; he may insist that any change destroys\nidentity so that in a strict and philosophical sense Alpha is distinct\nfrom Omega; or he may reject the case as one of vagueness, insisting\nthat, though we do not know the answer, either Alpha is Omega or she\nis not.\n\nHowever, the most tempting option for the endurance theorist, which\nkeeps closest to common sense, is to accept that the case is one of\nvagueness, deny the multiplicity of entities embraced by the\nperdurance theorist and reject Evans\u2019s argument against vague\nidentity.\n\nThat this is so highlights the fact that there is no easy solution to\nthe problem consonant in every respect with common sense. Locating the\nvagueness in language requires us to acknowledge a multiplicity of\nentities of which we would apparently otherwise have to take no\nnotice. Whilst locating it in the world requires an explanation of\nhow, contrary to Evans\u2019s argument, the impossibility of vague\nidentity is not a straightforward consequence of the classical\nconception of identity, or else the abandonment of that\nconception.\n10. Are there philosophical problems about identity?\n\nFinally in this entry we return briefly to the idea mentioned in the\nintroduction that although the debates about identity make sense they\ncannot genuinely be debates about identity, since there are no\nphilosophical problems about identity. This view has recently been\nreceiving increasing attention. Lewis is the most cited defender\nof this view. In the context of discussing the putative\n\u201cproblem\u201d of trans-world identity he says:\n\n[W]e should not suppose that we have here any problem about\nidentity. We never have. Identity is utterly simple and\nunproblematic. Everything is identical to itself; nothing is ever\nidentical to anything except itself. There is never any problem about\nwhat makes something identical to itself; nothing can ever fail to\nbe. (Lewis 1986: 192\u201393)\n\nLewis\u2019s argument here might be expanded as\nfollows: Consider any putative problem about the conditions under\nwhich a thing x is identical with a thing y. There\nare only two cases: either (i) x is identical with\ny, or (ii) x is not identical with y.\nConsider case (i). In this case the putative problem is about the\nconditions under which x is identical with itself. But there\ncannot be any such problem, because it is a conceptual truth that\neverything is identical with itself, and so x is identical\nwith itself under all conditions. To ask for the conditions under\nwhich something is identical with itself is like asking \u2018Under\nwhat conditions is one thing one thing, and not two things?\u2019\nThere can be no informative answer because necessarily, if something\nis one thing then it is one thing, and not two things, and nothing\nmore can be said. Now consider case (ii). The putative problem is now\nabout the conditions under which a thing x is identical with\na different thing y. But there cannot be any such problem,\nbecause it is a conceptual truth that one thing and a different thing\nare not identical, and so there are no conditions under which\nx and y are identical. To ask for the conditions\nunder which one thing and a different thing are identical is like\nasking \u2018Under what conditions are two things one thing, and not\ntwo things?\u2019 There can be no informative answer because\nnecessarily, if two things are two things, then they are two things,\nand not one thing, and nothing more can be said. And so, whether case\n(i) or case (ii) holds, there can be no problem about the conditions\nunder which a thing x is identical with a thing\ny.\n\nThe argument seems persuasive, but anyone who accepts it is committed\nto it being possible to state problems that seem to be about\nidentity (such as the \u201cproblem\u201d of trans-world identity)\nin terms that make it clear that such problems are not in fact about\nidentity. Furthermore, it seems that we do very often use the\nconcept of identity, and an explanation of how and why we use it\nso often seems to be required if the argument above is sound.\n\nMost seem to have accepted Lewis\u2019s view (see, e.g., Akiba\n2000, Hawthorne 2003, Noonan 2007, Noonan and Curtis 2018), but\nthere are some who dissent (Gallois 2005, Shumener 2020, Azzano\nand Carrara 2021). The question of how and why we use the concept of\nidentity was a central concern of Wittgenstein (see Fogelin 1983 for\nan overview), and has recently received attention from others (Burgess\n2018).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Akiba, K., 2000. \u201cIdentity is Simple\u201d,\n<em>American Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 37(4): 389\u2013404.", "Azzano, L. &amp; Carrara, M., 2021. \u201cThe Grounding of\nIdentities\u201d, <em>Philosophia</em>, 49(5): 1943\u20131952.", "Baxter, D.
