    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe science of ecology studies interactions between individual\norganisms and their environments, including interactions with both\nconspecifics and members of other species. Though ecology emerged in\nthe 19th century much of its theoretical structure only emerged in the\ntwentieth century. Though ecology includes a wide variety of\nsub-fields, philosophical analysis of ecology has so far been\nrestricted to population, community, and ecosystem ecology. Central\nphilosophical problems include the explication of relevant notions of\necological diversity and the relation between diversity and\nstability. Other debated questions are the nature of laws and theories\nin ecology, strategies of model-building, and reductionism.\nContemporary ecology is undergoing a conceptual upheaval because of\nincreased computational power. The recent emphasis on individual-based\nmodels, which embrace methodological individualism, should be viewed as\na return of reductionism in ecology. Other important developments\ninclude widespread interest in spatially explicit models and the advent\nof Geographical Information Systems.\n",
