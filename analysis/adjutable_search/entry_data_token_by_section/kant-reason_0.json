    "main_text": "Theoretical reason: reason\u2019s cognitive role and limitations\n1. Theoretical reason: reason\u2019s cognitive role and limitations\n\nIn the first half of the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues\nthat we obtain substantive knowledge of the world through two\ncapacities: sensibility and understanding. Empirical judgments depend\non both sensory experience and concept formation.\nKant emphasizes the solidity of empirical knowledge gained this\nway.\n\nIn the next large section, Kant discusses \u201ctheoretical\nreason\u201d\u2014especially philosophical reasoning. The\n\u201cTranscendental Dialectic\u201d attacks philosophical efforts\nto gain knowledge of a \u201ctranscendent\u201d world, that is, a\nworld beyond that revealed by the senses. \u201cDialectic,\u201d\nsays Kant, is \u201ca logic of illusion\u201d (A293/B349).\nHere, reason appears mainly as a source of empty or false ideas.\n\nMany readers fall away before the final section of the book, where\nKant reviews his overall method\u2014his own use of \u201cpure\nreason.\u201d The closing \u201cTranscendental Doctrine of\nMethod\u201d considers reason in terms of its\n\u201cdiscipline,\u201d \u201ccanon,\u201d\n\u201carchitectonic,\u201d and \u201chistory.\u201d\n\nThis makes it easy to interpret the Critique of Pure Reason\nas simply critical of reason\u2014as dismissing its claims to give us\nknowledge. But if this were all that Kant intended, how should we\nunderstand his own philosophical reasoning? Kant certainly wants to\nshow the limits of reason. But he also needs to show how reason can\nplay a constructive role. He does this in at least three ways: he\nrelates reason to empirical truth (\u00a71.1\n below); he explores reason\u2019s role in scientific enquiry\n (\u00a71.2\n below); and he explains the benefits of appreciating reason\u2019s\nlimits (\u00a71.3\n below).[2]\n\nIn addition, when we engage in philosophical reasoning, we ought to\nunderstand the capacity that we are using. As Kant puts it, reason\nmust take on \u201cthe most difficult of all its tasks, namely, that\nof self-knowledge\u201d (Axi). The first Critique begins\nthis task, but does not complete it (\u00a71.4\n below).\n",
