    "main_text": "Developments Towards a Retrocausal Model || The Two-Time Boundary Value Model\n6.5 The Two-Time Boundary Value Model\n\nSchulman (1997, 2012) proposes a solution to the quantum measurement\nproblem based on the possibility of future conditioning, which\noriginates from his analysis of the thermodynamic arrow of time.\nBeginning with Loschmidt\u2019s challenge to Boltzmann\u2014that it\nshould not be possible to derive irreversible dynamical behavior from\ntime-symmetric dynamics (see the entry on\n thermodynamic asymmetry in time)\u2014Schulman\n notes that successful \u201cretrodiction\u201d of past macroscopic\nstates of some thermodynamic system is indeed asymmetric to successful\n\u201cprediction\u201d of future macroscopic states. For successful\nretrodiction, rather than evolving each of the microscopic states of\nsome macroscopic state according to the dynamical laws (which is\nidentical to the process of prediction, and is the basis of\nLoschmidt\u2019s challenge), one instead hypothesizes a prior\nmacroscopic state to which the prediction process can be applied such\nthat the current macroscopic state of the system obtains with high\nlikelihood given the dynamical evolution of the prior microscopic\nstates. With respect to the set of possible microscopic states for the\ncurrent macroscopic state, since the evolution of the vast majority\n(on Liouville measure) of these states according to the dynamical laws\nresult in trajectories that conflict with the retrodiction hypothesis,\nthese states are effectively rejected in the process of retrodiction\nin favor of those special few microscopic states that correspond to\nthe dynamical evolution of acceptable hypothetical initial\nconditions.\n\nSchulman\u2019s proposal in response to this asymmetry is that, just\nas the set of possible final microscopic states must be restricted for\nsuccessful retrodiction, so should the permissible initial microscopic\nstates be restricted for the purposes of prediction. Thus, since final\nmicroscopic states are subject to conditioning from the past state of\nthe system, the initial microscopic states will be subject to\nconditioning from the future state of the system\u2014a conditioning\nthat is hidden in thermodynamic processes where the microscopic states\nof the system are indistinguishable macroscopically. This future\nconditioning is a central feature of Schulman\u2019s two-time\nboundary condition proposal and the hidden nature of this conditioning\nSchulman calls \u201ccryptic constraints\u201d.\n\nRegarding quantum theory, Schulman claims that quantum superpositions\nof macroscopically distinct states generated by quantum evolution,\nwhich are at the heart of many of the nonclassical elements of quantum\ntheory, are what he calls \u201cgrotesque\u201d states, and proposes\nthat these states are avoided in quantum systems due to future\nconditioning and cryptic constraints. Just like there are special\nmicroscopic states of thermodynamical systems that evolve\n\u201cagainst\u201d the second law of thermodynamics (which are\nidentified in the process of retrodiction), so too must there be\n\u201cspecial\u201d microscopic states of a quantum system which do\nnot lead to grotesque states when evolved according to the quantum\ndynamical laws, rather these states will lead to one particular\ndefinite state of the superposition. Schulman\u2019s solution to the\nquantum measurement problem is that, in every performed experiment,\nthe initial conditions of the quantum system are among these special\nstates which, through pure unitary quantum evolution, yield a single\noutcome to the experiment (Schulman 1997: 214). Grotesque states, the\nproblematic states of the quantum measurement problem, are thus\navoided.\n\nSchulman\u2019s proposal implicitly assumes that, in the preparation\nof an experiment, it is only the macroscopic state of the system which\nis under the control of the experimenter; it is impossible to control\nthe precise microscopic state. It is this initial microscopic state\nthat Schulman suggests is always a special state. Schulman envisages\nthe special-state constraint as correlated with future conditions and,\nsince these constraints are not apparent to the experimenter until the\nfuture conditions are \u201cmeasured\u201d at the end of the\nexperiment, these constraints are cryptic. As a result of the future\nconditioning of initial states, Schulman\u2019s proposal is a kind of\nretrocausal mechanism, understood in an interventionist sense.
