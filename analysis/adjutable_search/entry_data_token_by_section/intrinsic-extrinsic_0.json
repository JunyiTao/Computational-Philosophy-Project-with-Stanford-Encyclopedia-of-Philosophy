    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe standard way to introduce the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic properties is by the use of a few orientating\ncharacterisations. David Lewis provides the following list:\n\n\nA sentence or statement or proposition that ascribes intrinsic\nproperties to something is entirely about that thing; whereas an\nascription of extrinsic properties to something is not entirely about\nthat thing, though it may well be about some larger whole which\nincludes that thing as part. (Lewis 1983a: 197)\n\nA thing has its intrinsic properties in virtue of the way that thing\nitself, and nothing else, is. Not so for extrinsic properties, though\na thing may well have these in virtue of the way some larger whole is\n\u2026 (Lewis 1983a: 197)\n\nIf something has an intrinsic property, then so does any perfect\nduplicate of that thing; whereas duplicates situated in different\nsurroundings will differ in their extrinsic properties. (Lewis 1983a:\n197)\n\n\nThe other way to introduce the subject matter is by providing examples\nof paradigmatic intrinsic and extrinsic properties. One half of this\ntask is easy: everyone agrees that being an uncle is extrinsic, as is\nbeing six metres from a rhododendron. The other half is more\nchallenging, since there is much less agreement about which properties\nare intrinsic. Lewis (1983a, 1986a, 1988), for example, has insisted\nthat shape properties are intrinsic, but one could hold that an\nobject\u2019s shape depends on the curvature of the space in which it\nis located at, and this might not even be intrinsic to that space\n(Nerlich 1979), let alone the object (Bricker 1993, McDaniel 2007, and\nSkow 2007). Lewis also mentions charge and internal structure as being\nexamples of intrinsic properties. (For ease of exposition, we will\nassume below that shape properties are intrinsic. We will also assume\nthat properties like being made of tin, and having a mass of 500kg are\nintrinsic.)\n",
