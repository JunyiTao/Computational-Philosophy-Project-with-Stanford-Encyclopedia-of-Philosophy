The category of \u2018dangerous sport\u2019 includes\nnon-violent sports such as free solo rock-climbing and downhill skiing,\ncollision sports such as American football and rugby union, and combat\nsports such as boxing and mixed martial arts. What is the value of\ndangerous sports, and how, if at all, should the state regulate such\nactivities through public policy?\n\n\nRussell argues that dangerous sports manifest distinctive forms of\nvalue (2005). Their value lies in the perfectionist ideal of\n\u2018self-affirmation\u2019, whereby we challenge and resist the\nordinary bounds of our lives and attempt to extend those boundaries to\nsurpass the apparent limits of our being (Russell, 2005). Russell\nfurther argues that these kinds of sports can be of particular\npractical benefit for children. Such activities place children in a\ncontext in which they must confront danger, thereby preparing the child\nfor adulthood, as well as helping the child to discover and affirm\naspects of her selfhood (Russell, 2007).\n\n\nOthers have suggested that, in their current form, collision sports\nsuch as American football and combat sports such as boxing should be\nbanned by the state. Nicholas Dixon (2001) has argued on autonomy-based\ngrounds that boxing which involves blows to the head should be banned,\nbut boxing that limits the permissible target area to the area between\nthe waist and the head should be permitted. Others have defended the\nstatus quo on the grounds that any attempt to criminalise boxing will\nlead to the sport moving underground where more harm may result\n(Warburton, 1998).\n\n\nPam Sailors (2015) has argued that American football, both at the\nprofessional and amateur levels, is morally objectionable, though she\nstops short of proposing its prohibition. She grounds this objection on\nharm to the players, the objectification of the players, and the harms\ndone by players to non-players. Angelo Corlett (2019) has argued, more\nnarrowly, that a prohibition of American football at the\ninter-collegiate level could be justified on account of the large\nhealthcare and medical costs that must be borne by the general public\narising from associated injuries. Mike McNamee and Francisco Javier\nLopez Frias have called for caution regarding the proposed prohibition\nof American football and other collision sports that pose the risk of\npermanent brain injury. In particular, they critically analyze\narguments for the elimination of such sports that draw on Mill\u2019s\nconsensual domination principle. These arguments equate the decision of\nplaying football with that of selling oneself to slavery (consensual\ndomination). According to Lopez Frias and McNamee (2017), human beings\nshould be allowed to pursue the kind of lives that they have reasons to\nvalue, even if that involves consensual domination. For them, the\nnature of the goods people pursue in their lives might justify the\nsacrifice of future autonomy. Moreover, they challenge the idea that\nCTE-related injuries are morally equivalent to harms that arise from\nconsensual domination. In a latter paper, Lopez Frias and McNamee\npropose that one possible solution to the debate over the reform or\nprohibition of such sports should have at its centre the concept of\n\u2018social good\u2019 (Lopez Frias and McNamee, 2019).\n",
