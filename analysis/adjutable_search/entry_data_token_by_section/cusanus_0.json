    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nNicholas of Cusa (Nikolaus Cryfftz or Krebs in German, then Nicolaus\nCusanus in Latin) was born in 1401 in Kues (now Bernkastel-Kues) on\nthe Moselle River between Koblenz and Trier. He was one of four\nchildren in a bourgeois family. His father, Johan Cryfftz, was a\nprosperous merchant who became one of the landed gentry in Trier. The\nfirst record we have of Nicholas\u2019 early education comes from his\nstudy of the liberal arts at University of Heidelburg in\n1416\u201317. He then moved to the University of Padua where he\nstudied canon law, receiving his Doctor of Canon Law in 1423. In Padua\nhe met the physician and mathematician Paolo Toscanelli, the canonist\nGiuliano Caesarini, and the humanists Guarino da Verona and Vittorino\nda Feltre.\n\nIn 1425 he entered the service of the archbishop of Trier and, as his\nsecretary, received income from several benefices. By 1426 he was in\nCologne where he may have lectured on canon law, studied philosophy\nand theology, and began researches into original source material and\ninto the annals of German law. There he was able to prove that the\nDonation of Constantine was an eighth-century forgery, and he found\nmanuscripts of Pliny\u2019s Natural History and of\nPlautus\u2019 comedies. In Cologne he met Heimerich of Campo, who\nintroduced him to the writings of Ramon Llull, Albert the Great and\nhis commentary on Dionysius, and Proclus\u2019 commentary on\nPlato\u2019s Parmenides. In 1428 and 1435 Nicholas was\noffered positions teaching canon law at the University of Louvain, but\nhe turned them down to remain in church administration.\n\nOrdained a priest sometime during the 1430s, Nicholas first gained\nwider notice for his work as a conciliarist at the Council of Basel.\nThere he wrote De concordantia catholica (1433), arguing for\nthe authority of the council over that of the pope and stressing the\nnotions of consent and representation. After the turmoil at Basel\nsplit the council, Nicholas ultimately sided with the papal party and\nleft the conciliarists. In 1437 he was part of an embassy sent to\nConstantinople to seek reconciliation of the Greek Church with Rome.\nHe reported that, during the voyage home, the insights of De docta\nignorantia (1440) came to him as a kind of divine revelation. He\ncontinued as a papal legate to Germany from 1438\u201348. Named\ncardinal in 1446 by Eugenius IV, Cusanus was elevated to that position\nin 1448 by Nicholas V and was sent to Germany in 1451 as papal legate\nto reform the church.\n\nNicholas\u2019 most important philosophical works were written in the\ntwenty-four years between the appearance of De docta\nignorantia and his death. De coniecturis\n(1442\u201343), De dato patris luminum (1445), Apologia\ndoctae ignorantiae (1449), Idiota de sapientia, Idiota de\nmente, Idiota de staticis experimentis (all 1450) were among\nimportant works of the decade from 1440\u20131450, as were many\nsermons and works on mathematics. The final fourteen years of his life\nsaw the appearance of De visione Dei (1453), De\nberyllo (1458), De possest (1460), De li non\naliud (1461), De ludo globi (1462\u201363), De\nvenatione sapientiae (1462), Compendium (1464) and\nDe apice theoriae (1464), more works on mathematics and many\nmore sermons. Of particular note are two works he wrote during these\nyears that reached out to other religions, especially Islam, De\nPace Fidei (1453) and Cribatio Alchorani (1461).\n\nIn 1450 he was named bishop of Brixen in the Tirol. In 1452 he began\nactive administration in Brixen, but his attempts at reform led to\nthreats and clashes with Sigismund, the count of Tirol. Many of his\nover two hundred sermons date from this time in Brixen, though his\nreform efforts there and earlier in Germany mostly failed. Nicholas\nfinally retreated from the conflict in Brixen to Rome, where he\nremained in the papal curia advising Pius II. He died in 1464 in Todi\non his way from Rome to Ancona. His remains were buried in his titular\nChurch, St Peter in Chains, at Rome; his heart was sent to Kues and\nburied in the chapel of the hospice for elderly men there that he\nendowed in his will. The hospice survives and his remarkable library\nis housed there today.\n",
