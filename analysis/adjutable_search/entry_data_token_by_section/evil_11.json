    "main_text": "Attempted Total Refutations || Human Epistemological Limitations\n5.1 Human Epistemological Limitations\n\nThe most popular attempt at a total refutation of the argument from\nevil claims that, because of human cognitive limitations, there is no\nsound inductive argument that can enable one to move from the premise\nthat there are states of affairs that, taking into account only what\nwe know, it would be morally very wrong for an omnipotent and\nomniscient person to allow to exist, to the conclusion that there are\nstates of affairs such that it is likely that, all things considered,\nit would be morally very wrong for an omnipotent and omniscient\nperson to allow those states of affairs to exist.\n\nThe appeal to human cognitive limitations does raise a very important\nissue, and we have seen that one very natural account of the logical\nform of the inductive step in the case of a direct inductive argument\nis not satisfactory. But, as we have seen in sections 3.3 and 3.4,\nthere are other accounts of the type of reasoning involved in the\ncrucial inductive step in evidential forms of the argument from\nevil. First of all, the appeal to human cognitive limitations does\nnot itself show that there is anything wrong either with the\nreasoning that Draper offers in support of the crucial premise in his\nindirect inductive version of the argument from evil, or with the\ninference to the best explanation type of reasoning employed in the\nupdated version of Hume\u2019s indirect inductive formulation of the\nargument from evil. Secondly, the appeal to human cognitive\nlimitations provides no reason at all for rejecting the version of\nthe argument from evil that appeals to fundamental equiprobability\nprinciples of inductive logic, principles that arguably must obtain\nif any sort of induction is ever justified.\n\nShort of embracing compete inductive skepticism, then, it would seem\nthat an appeal to human cognitive limitations cannot provide an\nanswer to evidential versions of the argument from evil.\n",
