Introduction\n1.1 Terminology\nAs our preface suggests, the ordinary use of the phrase \u201chuman\nenhancement\u201d covers a wide range of practices, most of which are\nnot explored in the enhancement ethics literature. To orient our\ntour, both \u201chuman\u201d and \u201cenhancement\u201d merit some\ninitial clarification, even before we pursue the ways they are\ninterpreted and debated in the literature. For example, as\nsection 2.3 below shows, equivocations between biological and\nevaluative senses of the term \u201chuman\u201d are rich sources of\nmany superficial disagreements in these debates. Is there anything\nspecial about being a member of the biological species homo\nsapiens that enhancements could threaten, or are those who\ncriticize enhancement as \u201cdehumanizing\u201d really thinking\nabout the loss of other markers of the moral status we confer on\npersons? To look ahead, we think it will become clear in the sections\nbelow that the ethical issues at the heart of the debate about human\nenhancement are not about policing the biological boundaries of the\nspecies homo sapiens. At this point, however, it is enough to\nnote that we are foreclosing neither sense of \u201chuman\u201d from\nthe start, but will stay alert to both until it becomes important to\ndistinguish and relate them.\nWith \u201cenhancement\u201d, on the other hand, it is helpful to\nspecify a working definition from the start. We understand the\npractices that are being debated in the enhancement ethics literature\nto be biomedical interventions that are used to improve human form\nor functioning beyond what is necessary to restore or sustain\nhealth. This broad definition flows from and reflects the\nfoundational literature in this area (Parens 1998), but it also has\nseveral implications that are sometimes forgotten.\nFirst, it means that simple line-drawing exercises aimed at\nisolating \u201cenhancement technologies\u201d from other biomedical\ninterventions for special precautionary regulation or oversight are\ndestined to be ineffective (pace Anderson 1989). There\nare no \u201cenhancement technologies\u201d per se. Whether\na given biomedical intervention counts as an enhancement depends on how\nit is used. When ankle-strengthening surgery is used to improve a\nbicyclist\u2019s competitive edge, it might raise enhancement\nconcerns, but as a treatment for a bicyclist\u2019s ankle injury, it\ndoes not. This means that the developers of even the most outr\u00e9\nenhancement interventions will almost always be able to appeal to some\ncorrelative therapeutic uses to justify their research, testing, and\nrelease into the market (Mehlman 1999). On the other hand, simply\npointing out that biomedical technologies can have both therapeutic and\nenhancement uses does nothing to collapse the logical distinction\nbetween those uses, or to defeat the claim that those distinguishable\nuses might warrant different ethical responses (Buchanan 2011).\nSecond, the definition of \u201cenhancement\u201d used in this\nentry restricts the term to biomedical interventions, even though\nother methods of increasing normal human capacities raise ethical\nissues as well. Electronic and robotic tools that enable us to listen,\nobserve, help or harm at a distance, lifestyles designed to maximize\nparticular talents, and social practices that foster new forms of\nhuman relationship all come with their own trade-offs and moral\nconcerns. But the focus of the enhancement ethics literature is\noverwhelmingly on interventions that make biological changes in human\nbodies and brains, using pharmaceutical, surgical, or genetic\ntechniques (Clarke, Savulescu, Coady, et. al., 2016). Standard examples\ninclude:\n\ncosmetic surgery and the use of biosynthetic growth hormone to\nincrease stature (Miller, Brody and Chung, 2000; Little, 1998; White,\n1993; Conrad and Potter, 2004),\n\u201cblood doping\u201d and steroid use to improve athletic\nendurance and strength (Miah 2004; Murray 2009; Tolleneer, 2013),\npsychopharmaceutical approaches to increasing memory, elevating\nmood, and improving cognitive capacities (Elliott 1998; Whitehouse,\net. al., 1997; Sandberg 2011; Glannon 2008; Levy, Douglas, Kahane,\net. al. 2014a; Duncan 2016; Earp 2018), and\npotential genetic and neurological manipulations to increase the\nhuman life span, acquire new sensory-motor abilities, and, through\n\u201cmoral enhancement\u201d, live together in more peaceable,\ngenerous, and just ways (cf. Savulescu, ter Meulen and Kahane 2011;\nHarris 2016; Wiseman 2016; Johnson, Bishop and Toner 2019).\n\nOf course, the line between biomedical and other enhancements is\noften blurry. Caffeine is a drug that can heighten alertness, but\ncoffee drinking is a social practice outside the biomedical sphere.\nMeditation and prayer can have the same physiological effects as\ndrugs.  The \u201ccyborgs\u201d of science fiction blend human\nbodies with electronic and mechanical tools (Hughes 2004). The\nprospect of uploading minds into computers to create bodiless human\nlife is sometimes characterized as \u201cradical enhancement\u201d\n(Agar 2013). But as important and intriguing as these mixed cases are\nfrom ethical and conceptual perspectives (Hogle 2005), this essay will\nonly engage them in two ways. The first is when they help advance our\nunderstanding of core issues raised by the enhancement uses of the\nemerging biomedical technologies. The second is when, inevitably, our\ndiscussion of biomedical enhancements uncovers insights that reflect\nback upon the ethical dimensions of these other practices.\nFinally, our definition implies that enhancement interventions\nattempt to improve specific human capacities and traits, rather than\nwhole persons. Unlike such comprehensive personal-improvement\nstrategies such as prayer, psychoanalysis, or \u201cthe power of\npositive thinking\u201d, biomedical enhancements are, at best, a\npiecemeal approach to human perfectibility. As a result, most\nbiomedical enhancements involve trade-offs.  If extended life span comes\nwith prolonged frailty, or if enhanced altruism compromises survival\nskills, the overall value of the enhancement can be called into\nquestion (Shickle 2000).\n1.2 Background\nAn important part of the orientation for those new to thinking\nabout enhancement ethics is the ways in which current debates are\nshaped by the history of earlier efforts at perfecting people. At one\nlevel, perfectionist and meliorist impulses have deep roots in Western\nphilosophical and religious thinking, which both modern science and\nmedicine have inherited (Keenan 1999; Comfort 2012). Most advocates\nand critics of biomedical enhancement share these cultural\ncommitments, but have disagreeing visions of the ideal (Roduit,\nBaumann, and Heilinger 2013; Parens, 2005).  Other scholars, recalling\nthe historical imposition of hegemonic religious and political visions\nof salvation and citizenship, fear the elevation of any canonical\naccount of existing human virtues, in favor of visions that prize\npeople\u2019s capacity to shape their own ideals through reason,\nautonomy, and democratic deliberation (Sparrow, 2014; Buchanan\n2011). Others, pointing to the consequences of modern individualism\nfor the common good (Persson and Savelescu 2012), feel confident about\nbeing able to name the constellation of existing human traits that\nshould either be preserved (Kass 1997; Annas 1998; Agar, 2013) or\nenhanced (Bostrom 2003). However, almost no one in this literature\neschews the development and use of new medical tools for healing\npurposes (Kamm 2005; Kass 2003). Because of this, a first step in our\ndiscussion is to scrutinize the distinction between treatment and\nenhancement, to see if it can help demarcate where different\nmelioristic ideals diverge.\nAnother, perhaps more visible, backdrop for the enhancement ethics\nliterature is the history of the 20th century eugenics movement, which\nattempted to \u201cbreed better people\u201d and \u201cimprove the\nhuman gene pool\u201d through socially biased reproductive controls\nand inducements (Wikler 1999).  This background prompts questions\nabout the cultural authority of science and the social values it can\nperpetuate, and raises fears of slippery slopes that can lead to\negregious forms of oppression, by providing a vivid recent\ncounter-narrative to endorsements of enhancement as a way to fulfill\nour obligations to future generations (Sparrow 2011; Selgelid,\n2013). The eugenics backdrop tends to skew the burden of proof the\nother way in the debate, towards a more \u201cprecautionary\u201d\nstance that gives advocates of enhancement the burden of\ndistinguishing their proposals from old style eugenics in order to\ndefend the parts of that ideology that they share (Kitcher 1997;\nHarris, 2007; Agar 2004).\nFinally, in the historical foreground for enhancement ethics are\ncontemporary critiques of the commercialization (and homogenization) of\nbeauty through \u201caesthetic medicine\u201d (Bordo 1993), the\nevolving history of pharmaceutical performance enhancement in sports\n(Hoberman 1992), and the scientific career of human gene transfer and\n\u2018genetic engineering\u2019 (Friedman 1998). Each of these\nstories supports a literature of its own, which has contributed\nimportant insights to the broader discussion of enhancement ethics.\nFrom feminist and disability studies come critiques of the medicalization of\nhuman beauty, focusing on complicity with unjust social norms\nthat can turn ordinary welfare meliorism on its head to prioritize the\nenhancement uses of biomedicine over standard therapeutic applications\n(Silvers 1998). Meanwhile, discussions of \u201cdoping\u201d in\nsport have illuminated the ways in which enhancement interventions can\nundermine communal social practices that depend on presumptions of\nequality, lifting the discussion above the level of individual choices\nand transactions (Murray, 1987; 2009). Similarly the checkered career\nof human gene therapy has kept on the table the need to anticipate the\nphysical risks of putative improvements, and how daunting they would\nmake the foreseeable prospect of any intergenerational \u201cgerm\nline\u201d enhancement intervention (Walters and Palmer, 1997;\nKimmelman, 2009).\nAll of these contextual \u201cback-stories\u201d to the\ncontemporary enhancement debates are worth exploring further. They\nhave shaped contemporary thinking about and reactions to enhancement\nproposals and provide important cautionary tales to keep in mind when\nevaluating those proposals. At the same time, these back-stories bring\ntheir own assumptions and biases into the discussion, and can thereby\ncomplicate a fresh philosophical assessment.\n2. What are the Proper Limits of Health Care?\nWhile much of the enhancement ethics literature leans towards\nthought experiments set in the future, it is grounded in a set of\nimportant debates about how health care should be defined today.\nIn these debates, the claim is often made that the distinction between\nusing biomedical tools to combat human disease and attempting to use\nthem to enhance human traits can provide practical guidance on a range\nof issues, including the limits of health professionals\u2019\nobligations (Miller, Brody and Chung 2000), the scope of health care\npayment plans (Daniels and Sabin 1994), and the prioritization of\nbiomedical research protocols (Mehlman, Berg, Juengst and Kodish 2011).\nIn each of these cases, the line between treatment and enhancement is\ndrawn to mark an upper boundary of professional and social obligations.\nJust as the concept of futile treatment is used to indicate the limits\nof a doctor\u2019s obligations when further intervention no longer can\nachieve therapeutic goals, enhancement interventions are thought to\nfall outside health care\u2019s proper domain of practice by going\n\u201cbeyond therapy\u201d in pursuit of other non-medical goals.\nThis means that patients have no role-related right to demand such\nservices from health professionals, fair insurance coverage plans may exclude\nthem, and those who do provide them bear a burden of justification for\ndoing so that does not apply to \u201cmedically necessary\u201d\ninterventions.\nAs a biomedical boundary marker, the distinction between treatment\nand enhancement has been enshrined in policies at both professional and\ngovernmental levels, and continues to inform much of the public\ndiscussion of new biomedical advances. However, this distinction is\nexplicated in several different ways, which have different merits as\nboundary markers for biomedical research and practice. In fact, with\nphilosophical scrutiny, the distinction often seems in danger of\ncollapsing entirely under conceptual critiques even before the question\nof its moral merits is entertained.\nWhen it is used as a medical boundary concept, enhancement, like\nfutility, plays both descriptive and normative roles. To use these\nconcepts, we need to be able to identify our efforts as either futile\nor enhancing and we need to know what the boundary means for going\nfurther. Part of the practical challenge for policy-makers\nis that for enhancement interventions, these descriptive and normative\nimplications seem to be at cross-purposes. While futile treatments do\nno good, enhancements are by definition and description\nimprovements in personal welfare. Yet, the boundary function\nof calling them \u201cenhancements\u201d in health policy settings is\nto place them outside of sanctioned interventions. For a field\ndedicated to pursuing improved welfare for its patients, the fact that\nenhancements often look just like all the other improvements that\nhealth care strives to achieve makes it difficult to discern when an\nintervention transgresses the normative boundary that the concept\npurports to mark.\nThis has provoked three major ways of operationalizing the\nenhancement concept, each of which seeks to redress the weaknesses of\nits predecessor, which are covered in the next three subsections.\n2.1 Professional Domain Accounts\nThe first approach to defining the line between treatment and\nenhancement appeals to the health professions\u2019 conventional\nvision of their proper domain. Accordingly, \u201ctreatments\u201d\nare any interventions that the professional standards of care endorse,\nwhile \u201cenhancements\u201d are any interventions that the\nprofessions declare to be beyond their purview. Attempts by\nprofessional societies to police their own frontiers by discouraging\nparticular practices as \u201cenhancement\u201d rather than\n\u201ctreatment\u201d reflect this approach, as do appeals to\n\u201ccommunity standards\u201d by health care payers seeking to\ndistinguish \u201celective\u201d from \u201cmedically\nnecessary\u201d interventions for payment.\nFor those committed to a particular account of the goals of health\ncare, this approach can offer normative guidance for internal\ncriticism of suspect professional practices (Kass 1985). But of\ncourse, there are numerous competing philosophies of health care, none\nof which command universal allegiance within the health\nprofessions. In fact, this approach also resonates well with those who\nargue that the health professions have no intrinsic domain of\npractice, beyond that which they can negotiate with patients (Good\n1994). For those influenced by this libertarian view of professional\nautonomy, the normative lesson for professionals concerned about their\nobligations in specific cases can be simple: whatever interventions\ntheir patients will accept can be considered \u201ctreatments\u201d,\nwhile \u201cenhancements\u201d are simply those interventions which\nindividual health professionals refuse to provide (Engelhardt\n1990). Unfortunately, medical historians and sociologists point out\nthat the health professions have always been adept at adapting to the\ncultural beliefs and social values of the institutions and communities\nthey serve. This is done by \u2018medicalizing\u2019 new problems so\nthat they come to be seen as a legitimate part of medicine\u2019s\njurisdiction (Conrad 2007). Given the health professions\u2019\nphilosophical pluralism and political autonomy, their own conventions\nseem to provide no principled way to exclude new interventions from\ntheir domain. To the extent that useful \u201cupper-boundary\u201d\nconcepts are required at the policy level (e.g., for societies making\nhealth care allocation decisions) this impotence is an important\nfailing for this approach to drawing the distinction.\n2.2 Normal Function Accounts\nThere is another approach to interpreting the treatment/enhancement\ndistinction that seeks to provide a firmer theoretical foundation for\ndelimiting legitimate health care needs. On this approach, to be\nhealthy is to be able to do all that appropriately matched members of\none\u2019s own species can do, in our case what human beings of\nsimilar age and gender can do. Legitimate health care needs or\n\u201chealth problems\u201d or \u201cdiseases\u201d or\n\u201cmaladies\u201d are all characterized by a fall from that level\nof functional capacity. All proper health care services, therefore,\nshould be aimed at getting people back to \u201cnormal\u201d, e.g.,\nrestoring an individual\u2019s functional capability to the\nspecies-typical range for their reference class, and within that range\nto the particular capability level which was the patient\u2019s\ngenetic birthright. Interventions which take people to the top of\ntheir personal potential (like athletic training) or beyond their own\nbirth range (like growth hormone), or to the top of the range of their\nreference class, or to the top of the species-typical range, or beyond\n(!), are all to be counted as enhancements and fall successively\nfurther beyond the responsibility of medicine or health care.\nThe advantage of the normal function account is that it provides a\nsingle (relatively) unified goal for health care, towards which the\nburdens and benefits of various interventions can be relatively\nobjectively titrated, balanced, and integrated. Normal functionalists\ncan use physiology to determine when they\u2019ve achieved the\nspecies typical range and clinical histories to determine when\nthey\u2019ve brought a patient up to the baseline of his or her\npersonal capability range.\nSome critics of the normal function approach take issue with its\nfocus on the \u201cspecies-typical range\u201d, arguing that it is\ninsensitive to the diversity of ways in which human beings can\nflourish in life. They point out that those born with disabilities may\nbe wary of biomedicine\u2019s \u201cfatal attraction to\nnormalizing\u201d.( Silvers, 1998; Asch and Block, 2011) Moreover,\neven when no amount of treatment can give someone \u201cspecies\ntypical\u201d functioning, there may be compensatory technologies\nthat can actually expand their range of opportunities beyond the norm\n(Silvers 1998). Should powered wheelchairs be designed to slow and\nstop at the same distance that walking humans would succumb to\nfatigue, in order to keep them from \u201cenhancing\u201d their\nusers\u2019 abilities? By the same token, the naturally gifted may\nfind that they have no claim to treatment for injuries or accidents\nthat merely bring them down into the \u201cnormal range\u201d. If\nour champion thinkers, athletes and saints can legitimately claim\ntreatment for problems that impair their species-optimal functioning,\nbringing the rest of us up to their levels should count as proper\nhealth care as well. But that leaves only the most extreme\nimprovements on the other side of the \u201cenhancement\u201d\nboundary: if our species champions are the benchmark, only\ninterventions that create capacities no human has had before would\nfall beyond medicine\u2019s proper domain.  Individualizing the\noptimal functional range to individual genomic potentials will not\nresolve this problem, of course, to the extent that our genomes\nthemselves become biomedically malleable. Establishing the\n\u201cspecies-typical norm\u201d for a particular human function is\na difficult enough task, even where descriptive statistics can\nhelp. But when the boundary is \u201coptimal\u201d not\n\u201cnormal\u201d functioning, the evidentiary foundations of the\napproach begin to come apart (Sculley and Rehman-Sutter 2008).\nThe second serious problem for the normal function approach is the\nchallenge of prevention. While some efforts at health promotion, such\nas exercise, straddle the border of medical responsibility, many\npreventive interventions (i.e., vaccines) are widely accepted as\nlegitimate parts of medicine\u2019s mission and are located squarely\non the treatment side of the enhancement boundary. One of the ways to\nprevent disease is to strengthen the body\u2019s ability to resist\npathological changes before any diagnosable problem appears. But to the\nextent that prevention attempts to elevate bodily functions above the\nnormal range for the individual (and, in some cases, even the species\ntypical range), it seems to slide into what the normal function\napproach would call enhancement. If the normal function account is\ntaken seriously as a biomedical boundary marker, how does one defend\nthis kind of prevention? Conversely, if preventive interventions like\nthese are acceptable in medicine, what can it mean to claim that\nresearchers and clinicians should be \u201cdrawing the line\u201d at\nenhancement?\n2.3 Disease-Based Accounts\nProbably the most common rejoinder to the problem of prevention is\nto distinguish the problems to which they respond. Treatments are\ninterventions that address the health problems created by diagnosable\ndiseases and disabilities\u2014\u201cmaladies\u201d in the helpful\nlanguage of Gert, Culver and Clouser (2006). Enhancements, on the\nother hand, are interventions aimed at healthy systems and\ntraits. Thus, prescribing biosynthetic growth hormone to rectify a\ndiagnosable growth hormone deficiency is legitimate treatment, while\nprescribing it for patients with normal growth hormone levels would be\nan attempt at \u201cpositive genetic engineering\u201d or\nenhancement (Berger and Gert 1991). On this account, to justify an\nintervention as appropriate medicine means to be able to identify a\nmalady in the patient. If no medically recognizable malady can be\ndiagnosed, the intervention cannot be \u201cmedically\nnecessary\u201d and is thus suspect as an enhancement. This would\nclear the way for safe and effective genetic \u201cvaccines\u201d\nagainst predictable muscle damage (even if they provided better than\nnormal damage resistance) but would screen out as\n\u201cenhancements\u201d efforts to improve traits that were at no\ndiagnosable risk of deterioration (Juengst 1997).\nThese accounts have the advantage of being simple, intuitively\nappealing, and consistent with a lot of biomedical behavior. Maladies\nare objectively observable phenomena and the traditional target of\nmedical intervention. We can know maladies through diagnosis, and we\ncan tell that we have gone beyond medicine when no pathology can be\nidentified. Thus, pediatric endocrinologists discourage enhancement\nuses of biosynthetic growth hormone by citing the old adage \u201cIf\nit ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d. This interpretation is\nalso at work in the efforts of professionals working at the boundary,\nlike cosmetic surgeons, to justify their services. They claim to be\nrelieving \u201cdiagnosable\u201d psychological suffering\n(\u201cmental maladies\u201d) rather than satisfying the aesthetic\ntastes of their clients, and insurance companies insist on being\nprovided with that diagnosis before providing coverage for such\nsurgeries.\nOn the other hand, disease-based accounts also face at least two\nmajor difficulties. The first is one they share with the Professional\nDomain account: the problem of biomedicine\u2019s infamous nosological\nelasticity. It is not hard to coin new maladies for the purposes of\njustifying the use of enhancement interventions (Carey, Melvin and\nRanney 2008). Unless some specific (and usually contentious) theory\nof disease is employed to give this approach its teeth, it puts the\npower for drawing the boundary back into the profession\u2019s hands,\nand raises the same worries about the social consequences of\nmedicalization (Parens 2013).\nThe more important practical problem is that no matter how the line\nis drawn, most biotechnological interventions that could be seen as\nproblematic if used as enhancements will not need to be justified as\nenhancements in order to be developed and approved for clinical use.\nThis is because most such interventions will also have legitimate\ntherapeutic applications. Indeed, most biomedical tools with potential\nfor enhancement uses will first emerge as therapeutic agents. For\nexample, general cognitive enhancement interventions are likely to be\napproved for use only in patients with neurological diseases. However,\nto the extent that they are in high demand by individuals suffering the\neffects of normal aging, the risk of unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses\nwill be high (Whitehouse, et. al, 1997).\nThis last point is critical for policy purposes, because it suggests\nthat, in countries like the USA, the real challenge may not be\nregulation of the development of enhancement interventions, but rather\nthe regulation of downstream \u201coff-label\u201d uses of\ntherapeutic interventions for non-medical, enhancement purposes. The\npolicy problems then become problems about controlling access and use\nof certain interventions, rather than their development. Of course, the\nfact that a certain type of intervention is declared illegal for\nphysicians to dispense, does not immediately imply that it should be\nimmoral for everyone to pursue or other competent professionals to\nprovide. These realities have pressed those who would use the\ntreatment/enhancement distinction for policy purposes to articulate the\nmoral dangers of biomedical enhancement more clearly. Even if doctors\neschew such use on professional ethical grounds, are there independent\nmoral reasons why individual athletes, parents, students or other\n\u201cconsumers\u201d of enhancement interventions, should turn away\nfrom their availability?\n3. Is it Cheating to Use Enhancements?\nOne of the kinds of human enhancement that has received extensive\nphilosophical attention in recent years is the use of biomedical interventions to\nimprove the physical performance of athletes in the context of sports\n(Miah 2004; Murray 2009; Tolleneer 2013). One reason athletic\nperformance enhancement garners so much attention is because of its\ncurrency, given the epidemic of \u201cdoping\u201d scandals in\ncontemporary sport. Another reason, however, is that it seems to serve\nas a paradigm case for teasing out important dimensions of the problem:\nit involves measurable improvements in biological capacities in a\nsocial context that is both well outside health care and defined by\nclear rules of engagement.\nAt first impression, the ethical problem with performance\nenhancement in sport would seem to be simply a problem of cheating\n(Schermer, 2008a). If the rules of sport forbid the use of performance\nenhancements, then their illicit use confers an advantage to users\nagainst other athletes (who either accept the rules of the game or do\nnot have access to the enhancement interventions). That advantage, in\nturn, can create pressure for more athletes to cheat in the same way,\nundermining the basis for the competitions at stake and exacerbating\nthe gap between those who can afford enhancements and those who cannot\n(Murray 1987, Sparrow 2015). Extrapolating from sports to a\ncompetitive view of society at large, critics argue that the social\nacceptance of enhancement interventions in other spheres would also\ncreate unfair advantages for those with access to them, and perhaps\nlead to the development of new social divides between classes of\n\u201cgenobility\u201d and the \u201cgenpoor\u201d, raising\nfundamental justice and human rights concerns (Mehlman 2003, 2009;\nBuchanan, Brock, Wickler and Daniels 2000; Sparrow 2011).\n \nMuch of the rhetoric about \u201cdoping\u201d assumes the very\nclaim that needs to be established by argument: that the rules of\nsport (or the norms of social advancement) ought to ban the use of\nbiomedical enhancement. The rules of a game can be changed. In sports,\nnovel forms of performance enhancing equipment and training are\nroutinely introduced as athletic technology and expertise\nevolve. Where issues of athletes\u2019 equitable access arise, they\ncan be dealt with in one of two ways. Sometimes it is possible to\nensure fair distribution, as for example, when the International\nOlympic Committee negotiated an agreement with the manufacturer of the\nnew \u201cFastSkin\u201d swimming suit to provide suits to all the\nteams at the Sydney Olympics. In other cases, inequalities may simply\ncome to be accepted as unfortunate but not unfair. This is, for\nexample, how many people would view a story about an equatorial\ncountry that could not afford year-round artificial snow for its ski\nteam, and so could not compete evenly with the ski teams of northern\ncountries.  If enhancement interventions can either be distributed\nfairly or the inequities they create can be written into the rules of\nthe social game in question as part of the given advantages of the\nmore fortunate, then individual users no longer face a fairness\nproblem. For those who can afford it, for example, what would be\nethically suspect about mounting a mirror image of the \u201cSpecial\nOlympics\u201d for athletes with disabilities: a \u201cSuper\nOlympics\u201d, featuring athletes universally equipped with the\nlatest modifications and enhancements? (Munthe 2000) For answers to\nthat challenge, the critics of biomedical enhancement have to dig\nbeyond concerns about the fair governance of games to a deeper and\nbroader sense of \u201ccheating\u201d, in terms of the corrosive\neffects of enhancement on the integrity of admirable human practices\n(Loland 2002; Schermer 2008a).\nOn this view, to the extent that biomedical shortcuts allow specific\naccomplishments to be divorced from the admirable practices they were\ndesigned to reflect, the social value of those accomplishments will be\nundermined. If one\u2019s good grades are gained by drug fueled\n\u201ccramming\u201d rather than disciplined study, their value as\nevidence of learning diminish. This means that for institutions\ninterested in continuing to foster the social values for which they\nhave traditionally been the guardians, choices will have to be made.\nEither they must redesign their games to find new ways to evaluate\nexcellence in the admirable practices that are not affected by\navailable enhancements, or they must prohibit the use of the enhancing\nshortcuts. However, knowing which way to go suggests that one has a\ntheory of the social practice at risk and of the values that animate\nit. The case of sport again leads the way down this path in the\nliterature, perhaps because, unlike most important social practices\nthat might be susceptible to enhancement shortcuts (like child-rearing,\neducation, love, politics, and spiritual growth), the stakes are\nlow enough to allow for some deliberate policy-making at the\ninternational level.\nFor example, one prominent theory that has influenced the work of\nThe World Anti-Doping Association (WADA), the international\norganization committed to policing performance enhancement in elite\nsport, is the view that \u201cjust as healing is the point or goal or\nend of surgery, so the virtuous perfection of natural talents is the\npoint or goal or end of sport\u201d (Murray 2009). This statement has\nseveral important features for the enhancement debate. Sport is\nconcerned with celebrating differences in natural talents and the\nvirtues that can be displayed in attempts to differentiate one\u2019s\nown talents even further. The virtues that sport celebrates are\nsocially admirable habits and traits in and of themselves, and their\npromotion is what gives sport social value as a practice. However,\nwithin the practice, the virtues are instrumental (as either\nside-constraints or facilitators) to the perfection of the\nathlete\u2019s natural talents\u2014i.e., to their differentiation\nfrom other people\u2019s talents. Although the key role of\nhierarchical ranking in sport is often ignored in the rhetoric of\nsports organizations, philosophers of sport acknowledge that fixation\nwith hierarchical ranking\u2014with competition, contest,\nscore-keeping, record-breaking, championship, victory and\ndefeat\u2014is pervasive in the everyday practice of sport (Coakley\n1998) and that \u201ccomparing and ranking two or more\ncompetitors\u2026defines sports characteristic social\nstructure\u201d (Loland 2002, 10). Sport creates a system of values,\nvirtues, and practices that are designed to hierarchically grade people\nin terms of their (virtuously perfected) inherited traits and glorifies\nthe best specimens as champions. What is unfair about enhancement, on\nthis view, is that enhancement interventions undermine the ability of\nsport to distinguish those who passively inherited their talents from\ntheir progenitors from those who actively acquired them from their\nphysicians (Sandel 2004).\nBut this outcome seems to display the very problem that the\nfairness critique of enhancement was meant to combat: the danger of\nfomenting distributive injustice by creating social hierarchies of\nadvantage on arbitrary grounds (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2000;\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2005). On one hand, of the many ways humans use\ninherited traits to create interpersonal hierarchies, athletic\ncompetition is amongst the most benign. When it is \u201cjust a\ngame\u201d, comparative interpersonal ranking in terms of genetic\nidentity in sports is a welcome substitute for blood feuds, racism,\nand genocide. But when sport becomes a matter of national pride and a\nsource of economic opportunity, athletic losers risk more than simply\nadmiration and social status: like insurance applicants with genetic\nsusceptibilities, less naturally talented athletes risk access to\nimportant social benefits and potential life plans. In this regard,\nthe challenge that performance enhancement poses to sport is its\nindictment of the accepted social practice itself rather than its\nthreat to undermine it. The availability of biomedical abilities to\nundermine competition simply raises the question: are there ways to\nenjoy, appreciate and even show off our bodies and abilities without\nrequiring someone else to lose social standing on genetic grounds?\nFor the case of sports, it seems like this line of fairness\narguments ultimately backfires on the critics of enhancement. It opens\nthe door to thinking about enhancements as means to render the practice\nmore rather than less fair. Whether or not fairness arguments would\nhave a similar effect in debates about enhancement in the realm of\nother social practices, like parenting or diplomacy, is still an open\nquestion. But the theme of \u201ccheating\u201d has also been taken\nin another direction by the enhancement ethics literature, into\nconcerns about the authenticity of accomplishments achieved with the\nhelp of enhancements and the integrity of the enhanced individuals that\nclaim their rewards.\n4. Do Enhancements Compromise Authenticity?\nThe intuitive worry of authors who take this question seriously is that\nbiomedical enhancements might not only create corrosive short-cuts\nwithin valuable social practices, but also rob those who use them of\nthings they otherwise cherish about themselves\u2014endurance,\ndetermination, growth, faith, even luck\u2014by substituting \u201chollow\nvictories\u201d for authentic achievements. Losing the\nexperience of authentic achievements, in turn, diminishes the character\nof the user (Sandel 2007), alienating them from themselves and those\naround them (Agar 2013), and diminishing bonds of solidarity with\nnon-users (Sparrow 2014). Unpacking this intuitive concern into\narguments can take multiple paths.  It matters, for example,\nwhether the actors are parents enhancing their children or adults\nenhancing themselves (Habermas 2003), and whether accepted therapeutic\nuses of the same tools should face the same critique (Elliott\n2011).\nIn order to decide whether particular enhancements compromise\nauthenticity in the ways that these authors suggest, it is important to\nbe clear about what kinds of things are the appropriate targets of\nattributions of authenticity. Do enhancements undermine the\nauthenticity of one\u2019s self, agency, achievements or actions?\nAuthenticity is widely understood to be a matter of being \u201ctrue\nto oneself\u201d. Many authors in these debates do not take the time\nto carefully explicate their assumptions about \u201cthe self\u201d and what it\ntakes to be \u201ctrue to\u201d it. It is, of course, a challenge to\ncharacterize the self to which authentic individuals are true\n(Trilling, 1971; Taylor 1991; Guignon 2004). If there is a self,\nthen there are difficult synchronic identification questions (i.e., at\na given time, what features are constitutive of an agent?) and\ndiachronic identification questions (i.e., across time, what features\nmust persist in order for the self to survive?) that must be resolved.\nDerek Parfit, working in a tradition of \u201cbundle theories of the\nself\u201d, articulated the influential position that a person is\nnothing over and above a series of person-stages that are linked across\ntime by certain psychological continuity relations (Parfit 1984). Given\nthe controversy surrounding these debates about the nature of persons\nand personal identity, it is no surprise that there is little consensus\nabout whether enhancements undermine authenticity of the self.\nIn the enhancement debate it is important to distinguish the\nconcerns and the arguments that are provided for and against the moral\nand ethical significance of various types of enhancement. In this\nparticular domain, the rhetoric is often intense and feverish and it\nis important to be mindful of whether one is examining a\nconcern or an argument about the moral\npermissibility of a particular kind of enhancement (Buchanan\n2011). While evaluating these authenticity concerns, it is helpful to\nbear in mind the scope of the authenticity concern under\nscrutiny. That is, it is important to be clear about whether the\nauthenticity concern that is being expressed purports to (1)\u00a0show\nthat all enhancements are immoral, (2)\u00a0show that most\nenhancements are immoral, or (3)\u00a0show that a particular\nenhancement is, or would be, immoral (Buchanan 2011).\nOne style of argument for the claim that enhancements undermine\nauthenticity is to contend that we could claim no personal credit for\naccomplishments that are the result of biomedical enhancements,\nbecause the biomedical interventions that caused improvements in our\ncapacities would supersede our own agency in authoring the achievement\n(Sandel 2007). Defenders of this perspective argue that while, for\nexample, education, training, and practice proceed through\n\u201cspeech and deeds\u201d that are comprehensible by those who\nare learning a new skill, when biomedical enhancements are used they\nhave \u201ctheir effects on a subject who is not merely passive but\nwho plays no role at all. In addition, he can at best feel their\neffects without understanding their meaning in human terms\u201d\n(Kass 2003, 22). One reply to this argument is that if one has freely\nchosen to use an enhancement on the basis of \u201cspeech and\ndeeds\u201d, it is unclear how those enhancements are passive or less\nauthentic than traditional methods of improving one\u2019s capacities\n(Kamm 2005).  Moreover, just as we hold those with enhanced abilities\nto higher standards of responsibility for negligence and harm (Mehlman\n2003), our expectations for enhanced achievements may be\ncorrespondingly high (Carter and Pritchard 2019). But in both\nsituations neither the enhanced actors\u2019 agency in improving\nthemselves nor their authorship of the results seems to be in question\n(Cole-Turner 1998).\nOther critics of biomedical enhancements that appeal to\nconsiderations of authenticity acknowledge that enhanced individuals\ndo author their accomplishments, but question whether those successes\ncarry the same value as \u201cauthentic\u201d unenhanced\nachievements (Habermas 2003; Sandel 2007; Bublitz and Merkel\n2009). They maintain that when a marathon runner gains endurance\nchemically rather than through training, or when a mystic gains\nNirvana through psychosurgery rather than meditation, each misses the\npoint of these types of accomplishments. In the cases of marathon\nrunning and meditation, the outcomes of the activity cannot be\nseparated from the activity itself: the value of the accomplishment\nlies in the personal activities they reward as well as the benefits\nthey bring (Schermer 2008a; Spitzley 2018). However, even if these\ncriticisms show that authentic, unenhanced achievements are valuable\nfor reasons that do not apply to the enhanced achievement, they do not\nshow that the unenhanced approach is, overall, better. Such criticisms\nmerely establish that the two are valued differently. It is still\npossible that the enhanced achievement may have its own distinctive\ntype of value. As the history shows, the character-building struggles\nthat we admire seem adept at keeping pace with our tools.  Legend has\nit that Celtic warriors eschewed body armor (and even clothing!) in\nbattle because they thought it diminished the glory of a true\nvictory. Some authors used to insist that keyboards corrupt the\nwriting process.  According to this historical narrative, biomedical\nenhancements have provided humans with important tools for\nself-creation that should be embraced (DeGrazia 2000; Agar 2004).\nAnother set of authenticity concerns arises in arguments that focus\non enhancement interventions performed by parents in conceiving and\nraising their children (Habermas 2003). Here, the claim is that\noffspring who have no agency in deciding whether or not to be enhanced\nare (existentially) cheated of their authentic identities and the\nautonomy to create themselves as others normally do. Taken literally,\nthis argument runs into the logical problems of identity that plague\n\u201cwrongful birth\u201d suits in the law (these children have no\nprior identity to lose), and depends on too extreme a version of\ngenetic or biological determinism to be credible, given the plausible\ncausal efficacy of any of the possible enhanced interventions under\ndiscussion (these children\u2019s futures are no more restricted than\nany other participant in the natural genetic lottery) (Buchanan 2011).\nAs a result, a more common approach is to use such claims to draw\nattention to parental or social attitudes about procreation and\nparenting that seem morally problematic, whether or not their offspring\nare directly harmed or wronged by being enhanced (Davis, 2010)\nEvaluating these arguments also requires one to get clear about the\nnature and scope of the moral right to be a parent and the duties of\nparents to their children (LaFollette 1980; Liao 2006a).\n5. Are Enhancements Dehumanizing?\nIn the background of the debates over both the boundaries of\nmedicine and the ethics of self-improvement looms a third important\nset of philosophical concerns, which are about the implications of new\nbiomedical enhancement interventions for our common understanding of\nhuman nature and the future of our species. Critics emphasize\n\u201cdystopian nightmares\u201d and worry that enhancement\ninterventions may rob us of central normative features of our identity\nas human beings (Mehlman 2012). Enhancement enthusiasts, on the other\nhand, embrace the possibility that biomedicine might change human\nnature for the better, and some even look forward to the emergence of\nthe trans-humans or post-persons as the next step in (intentionally\ndirected) human evolution (Bostrom 2003; Harris 2007). At stake in\nthese debates is whether, or how much, normative weight to assign\nfeatures of the human condition that have traditionally been taken as\ngiven (e.g., the families into which we are born and our natural\ntalents and abilities) or inevitable (such as, pain and ageing).\nMoral philosophy has a long history of making normative appeals to\nhuman nature. There are thorny philosophical issues about whether such\nappeals are ever legitimate. Even since David Hume warned us not to\nderive an \u201cought\u201d from an \u201cis\u201d, philosophers\nhave been wary of making strong inferences about what ought to be done\ndirectly from claims about human nature. However, the tradition of\nvirtue ethics is much more comfortable with adopting a naturalistic\napproach that holds that human nature is the basis for what\nconstitutes human well-being and the virtues (for human beings)\n(Fitzgerald 2008; Keenan 1999). Explaining what is worth cherishing\nabout being human is an intuitive starting point for making sense of\nourselves, our relationships with other human beings, and the world\naround us. The task of getting clear about what we do and should value\nabout being human has important implications for the ethics of\nbiomedical enhancements.\nThree features of human nature are at the center of many debates about\nthe ethics of biomedical enhancement. The first feature is human\nvulnerability. According to one prominent view, human beings are\ncreatures that suffer, age and die, and our struggle to deal with this\nvulnerability is a central aspect of what makes human life valuable\n(Parens 1995). There are several sub-groups within the group of\ntheorists that emphasize the value of vulnerability in understanding\nthe value of being human. The first group consists of \u201clife cycle\ntraditionalists\u201d who criticize ambitions to control the human\nageing process and extend the human life span (Callahan 1995). The\nsecond group consists of the \u201cpersonalists\u201d, who valorize\nthe way in which human limitations are humbling and encourage modesty\n(Fitzgerald 2008). The third group consists of\n\u201cpsychopharmaceutical Calvinists\u201d who discourage easy fixes\nto melancholy and sadness (Elliot 1998). The second feature of\nhuman nature that is emphasized in these debates is discussed by\nspecies preservationists and environmentalists who stress our\nembodiment and place in nature alongside other organisms: \u201cby\nnature\u201d, we are biological creatures of a particular family,\ndefined by painfully evolved \u201cspecies barriers\u201d, and\nenhancements that blur or bend those boundaries by \u201cdirecting\nevolution\u201d do so at our peril (McKibben 2004). The third feature\nof human nature that is often discussed in these debates is our\nsociality. According to these theorists, human beings are social\ncreatures that relate to one another through a complex nexus of\ninterpersonal commitments and hierarchical structures (Liao 2006a; Liao\n2006b). Many sports theorists see the \u201cvirtuous perfection of\nnatural talents\u201d as the goal of athletic competitions. If one\naccepts this view, then victories fueled by biomedical enhancements\nthat subvert the natural interpersonal hierarchies that genetic\ndisparities in talent create can literally \u201cdehumanize\u201d\nsport (Tolleneer, Steryck and Bonte 2013).\nEach family of theories described above that emphasizes a feature\nof human nature as the basis for its position in the enhancement\ndebate utilizes a tool that is double-edged. As defenders of\ntrans-humanism point out, each feature of human nature that can\nproduce positive value for humans can just as easily be a source of\nhuman misery, which the history of technological progress has been\nlegitimately concerned with alleviating (Juengst 2004). In fact, the\nenthusiasts argue, there are no static features of the human\ncondition: human vulnerabilities to our environment have steadily\ndecreased over history, our moral kinship communities have expanded,\nand our tolerance for oppressive forms of social organization has\ndwindled (Bostrom 2003). Accordingly, to appeal to these features of\nhuman nature in abstraction cannot be helpful in deciding which\nvulnerabilities to honor, which family loyalties to respect, and which\nsocial arrangements to defend and develop. Where a biomedical\nintervention alters one of these dimensions of human nature, this is a\nsignal that the moral stakes are high. But those stakes are not always\nabout what might be lost from the human experience. There are also\nmoral dangers in what might be perpetuated, if we allow the\npreservation of these hallmarks of human nature to overshadow our\nother values.\nOne popular response to the enthusiasm of the trans-humanists is to\ndraw a line against interventions that might take their recipients out\nof our biological species altogether. This is usually framed as a\nminimal proposal to ban the clearest possible cases of immoral\nmanipulation, on which everyone could agree. From proponents of\n\u201cresponsible genetics\u201d (Council for Responsible Genetics\n1993) to defenders of our \u201cgenetic patrimony\u201d as the\n\u201ccommon heritage of all humanity\u201d (Knoppers 1991), to the\n\u201canti-post-humanist\u201d life cycle traditionalists, the\nprospect of \u201cspecies altering experiments\u201d which might\n\u201cdirect\u201d human evolution is provoking resistance (Mehlman,\n2012).\nA classic example of this resistance is the appeal for a UN\nconvention on genetic technologies framed in terms of \u201cthe\npreservation of the human species\u201d (Annas, Andrews, and Isasi\n2002). Its advocates claim that any intervention that would\n\u201calter the essence of humanity itself by taking human evolution\ninto our own hands and directing it toward the development of a new\nspecies sometimes termed the \u201cpost-human\u201d should be\nconsidered a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d because it would\nundermine the \u201cfoundation of human rights\u201d and set the\nstage for human extinction.\nOf course, species are not static collections of organisms that can\nbe \u201cpreserved\u201d against change like a can of fruit; they\nwax and wane with every birth and death and their genetic complexions\nshift across time and space (Robert and Bayliss 2003; Juengst\n2017). In our case, almost everything we do as humans has\nramifications on that process. To argue that everyone has the right to\ninherit \u201can untampered genome\u201d only makes sense if we are\nwilling to take a snap-shot of the human gene pool at some given\ninstant, and reify it as the sacred \u201cgenetic patrimony of\nhumankind\u201d\u2014which some come close to doing (cf. Mauron and\nThevoz 1991). \nThere is a risk here of confusing the biological sense of\n\u201chuman\u201d as an taxonomic term (like \u201ccanine\u201d or\n\u201csimian\u201d) and the word\u2019s normative use, as in\n\u201chuman rights\u201d. In the biological sense,\n\u2018human\u2019 refers to the biological species homo\nsapiens and to be human is to be a member of this biological\nspecies. In the evaluative sense, \u2018human\u2019 refers to a\nproperty that is the basis for having certain moral rights and a\nparticular kind of moral value. Obviously it is not enough to be\nbiologically human to enjoy human rights: human tissue cultures and\nhuman cadavers show us that. Is it even necessary to be biologically\nhuman to enjoy what we call human rights? There are many candidates for\nthe natural qualities that are the basis for moral rights, but none\nhinge on a biological designation. So why is it that interventions that\n\u201calter the species\u201d \u201cmight cause the affected\nchildren to be deprived of their human rights\u201d?\nOther opponents of directed evolution extend the argument\nfurther. They acknowledge that post-humans may be capable of\nclaiming the same natural rights as humans by virtue of their\ncapacities, but argue that creating such a species would challenge the\nnotion that being human is sufficient for claiming those rights, in the\nsame ways that discovering rational extraterrestrials would. This, in\nturn, would potentially disenfranchise the humans, like infants or the\nmentally disabled, who cannot show adequate functional capacities to\nqualify for equivalent species-neutral moral status. At the same\ntime, they argue, if the post-humans actually have expanded capacities,\nthey may claim natural rights to a proportionately expanded range of\nopportunities and freedoms, beyond those to which normal humans are\nentitled. This runs the risk of creating the kinds of oppressive\nhierarchical society against which human rights are supposed to be the\nantidote, and, potentially, to the return of coercive eugenic programs\naimed at the eventual extinction of the human species (Fukuyama, 2002;\nMehlman, 2012). \nOthers point out that while the conceit that our human species\ncould be preserved forever is as absurd as the hope of individual\nimmortality, those facts provide no reason to accelerate either\nsenescence or evolution (Robert and Baylis, 2003; Agar 2013). Even in\nthe face of the inevitability of a post-human species, they argue, we\nare justified in protecting our (admittedly)\n\u201cspecies-relativist\u201d values by rejecting enhancements that\nwould serve to alienate their recipients from their former selves,\ntheir families, and their communities. Normal evolutionary processes\nprovide the luxury of time for human populations to\n\u201cnegotiate\u201d their adaptations with the environments that\nprovoke them. Leaving evolution to these normal processes can thus\nensure that our evolution is both as deliberate and as tentative as\nour species\u2019 technological history\u2014and also that it is\nlike technological history in that key \u201cthreshold\u201d changes\ncan only be seen retrospectively. From this perspective, the danger is\nthe abrupt provocation of biological speciation which radical\nenhancements might provoke, if they created reproductive barriers\nbetween the enhanced and the unenhanced. However, given that almost\nnone of the single capacity enhancement interventions under\ndiscussion\u2014cognitive, physical, moral, etc. \u2014are likely to\nimmediately produce biological reproductive barriers in otherwise\nspecies-typical enhanced humans, it is not clear whether the\nintroduction of even the most \u201calienating\u201d enhancements\nwould create this risk. \nFinally, just as it is metaphysically impossible to\n\u201cpreserve\u201d our species from further evolution, it is\nimpossible for us to control the process \u201cfrom the inside\nout\u201d, because the genetic constitution of our species is shaped\nby environmental forces of selection beyond human abilities to control\nor even, as the phenomenon of emerging epidemics continues to\nillustrate, anticipate. Moreover, as disability studies scholars point\nout, humanity is in no better place to decide which human traits\ndeserve promotion today than during the heyday of the Eugenics\nmovement, even if society could tolerate the kinds of reproductive\npolicies it would require to manage just the human part of the\nevolutionary equation. The striking correspondence between the\naspirations of old style Eugenicists and some proposals of\ncontemporary Transhumanists, unfortunately, provides some evidence to\nback up this claim (Sparrow 2011). Such proposals assume that some\ngenotypes represent \u201cjewels in the genome\u201d (Sikela 2006)\nwhile others constitute a form of expensive \u201ctoxic waste\u201d\nthat could and should be cleansed from the gene pool (Buchanan, Brock,\nWikler, and Daniels 2000). According to critics of transhumanism, this\nway of thinking reduces the identities of people to their genotypes,\nand undermines our commitment to the moral equality of people despite\ntheir biological diversity (Asch and Block 2011).\nAs hard as they are to rationally reconstruct, it is important to\nlisten to concerns that some form of biomedicine violates\nhuman nature, even in public discussions of policy within a\npluralistic society. Whether the concern is the distortion of some\nconstant of the human condition, like senescence, or a \u201cspecies\naltering\u201d threat to our collective gene pool, or the corruption\nof practices designed to celebrate the inherited human traits we value\nmost, these appeals all signal that the intervention in question has\ndeep implications for who we want to be, given who we have\nbeen. However, respecting what we have (or have not) inherited from\nour parents does not in itself fulfill the need to decide which\npromises we would like to make to our children. Invocations of\nparticular vulnerabilities, loyalties, or forms of sociality from the\npast can provide fodder for arguing over the positive visions of human\nnature that should guide those promises. But in communities that\naccept the possibility of a pluralism of promises, such invocations\nshould also trigger another policy-making response: the need for\npolicy-makers to protect the interests of those excluded from their\nvisions, even while we discuss their merits. The natural human gene\npool has no top, bottom, edges or direction: it cannot be \u201cused\nup\u201d, \u201cdiverted\u201d, \u201cpurified\u201d or\n\u201cpolluted\u201d. The reservoir of human mutual respect, good\nwill and tolerance for difference, however, seems perennially in\ndanger of running dry. That is our human nature\u2019s truly fragile\nheritage that we should seek to preserve\u2014and some say even\nenhance\u2014in monitoring biomedical research on behalf of the\nfuture.\n6. Conclusion: Policy Perspectives\nNothing in the current debates over the ethics of human enhancement\nconvincingly supports the conclusion that the impulse that drives interest\nin biomedical enhancement is inauthentically human or morally evil. To\nthe extent that all technology is construed as an effort to extend and\nimprove our inherited human capacities, the impulse to enhance\nourselves is a hallmark of our species, as legitimate to celebrate as\nto disparage. On the other hand, just as specific technologies are\nnever \u201cvalue neutral\u201d in their design or use, specific\napplications of biomedical human enhancement can be dangerous, unfair,\nor vicious. Thus, it is reasonable to endorse the generic claim that\nbiomedical enhancement is morally acceptable as a human practice, and\nstill argue that specific biomedical enhancements would be unethical to\npursue.\nAs with other potent technologies, at some level the potential harms\nof unethical enhancements will also justify social efforts to formally\ncontrol their development and use through regulation, law and public\npolicy. Even though this topic moves quickly beyond the biomedical\ndomain to fundamental tensions in political and social philosophy, it\ndoes preoccupy enough of the practical ethics literature on biomedical\nenhancement to warrant a brief concluding discussion here.\nSome argue that firm lines should be drawn in public policy and\nprofessional practice, against particular degrees of\nenhancement, like \u201cspecies-altering interventions\u201d (Annas,\nAndrews and Isasi, 2002) or \u201cradical enhancements\u201d (Agar\n2013). The assumption here is that the moral problems raised by\nenhancement intensify as the enhanced move away from the human norm,\nand that a threshold can be identified beyond which prohibition would\nbe merited. Since drawing the line at all enhancement uses of\nmedical technologies would founder against too many contentious\nborderline and benign cases, this threshold is usually set at the\nboundary of our species identity, between the human and the\npost-human. As we have seen, this leaves many problematic\nenhancements in particular settings\u2014like \u201cgene\ndoping\u201d in sports\u2014unaddressed, and it is still not clear\nwhat moral salience sheer taxonomy can have, apart from other ethical\nconsiderations\u2014especially when one recalls the pernicious\npolicies other human taxonomies have supported in the past. In\npractice, such an approach would face all the classic line-drawing\nproblems, and the classic challenges of policing and enforcing\nprohibitions in a pluralistic and globalized society. Most importantly,\nhowever, if it is only those alterations that literally produce new\nbiological species that are of concern the vast bulk of potentially\nproblematic enhancement modifications would not fall within the\njurisdiction of this approach. \nAt the other extreme are those who support a libertarian position,\neschewing any blanket public regulation of enhancement in favor of\nfree markets involving those who would develop enhancement\ninterventions and individuals who would use them (Engelhardt 1990;\nFlanigan 2017). But this extreme position suffers the familiar\ndrawbacks of unregulated market economies: a toleration of severely\nharmful transactions (e.g., purchasing tickets to a match of\ngladiatorial combat), the exacerbation of economic inequalities, and a\npermissive stance to transactions with long-term adverse consequences,\nwhich lead to \u201ctragedies of the commons\u201d and environmental\ndevastation. As a result, even the more permissive authors qualify\ntheir \u201cutopian eugenics\u201d proposals with the sorts of\nregulatory protections that surround other consumer products in\nfree-market societies, in terms of safety, fraud, fair pricing and\nenvironmental protection (Bostrom 2003), and argue that the political\njustifications for those policies should support equivalent social\ncontrols for enhancement interventions (Kitcher 1997; Harris\n2007). Even with minimal legal regulations in place to ensure that\nmarkets for biomedical enhancement technologies will be\n\u201cfree\u201d, the libertarian emphasis on the legal\npermissibility of these transactions is a blunt instrument for dealing\nwith the subtle ethical complexities involved in deciding whether to\nuse a particular enhancement technology.\nBetween the extreme positions of prohibition or an open market is a\nmoderate position, which grounds enhancement policy in three of the\nobservations we have made in our conceptual and ethical analyses\nabove:\nFirst, policy will need to focus on governing the uses of technology\nrather than preventing its development in the first place. This is\nbecause of the conceptual flexibility of the boundary between\nenhancement and treatment. Almost all potential enhancement\ninterventions will be developed first as interventions to treat or\nprevent human health problems, pursuing goals that will easily offset\ntheir potential unethical applications. Beyond that, even to\nassess the potential harms of enhancement applications of approved\nmedical interventions will require research, even if it also helps pave\nthe way for their use. This means that interventions capable of being\nused for enhancements will be inevitably invented and perfected as\nby-products of biomedical scientific progress, and their social control\nwill have to focus on governing their dangerous, unjust or vicious uses\n(Mehlman 1999).\nSecond, there are at least two possible responses to harmful\ninterventions, and policy-makers should keep both in mind. If one\nwon\u2019t work, the other approach may. On the one hand, one\ncan try to police and punish unauthorized uses of technology, or\nalternatively one can focus on protecting the interests of those\ndisadvantaged by those uses. Thus, in sports, authorities screen for\nand punish \u201cdoping\u201d athletes, because they cannot fix the\nessential genetic injustice of the spirit of sport. In the workplace\nand in higher education, on the other hand, there may be more concern\nto reduce the competitive stresses that would tempt people to rely on\nstimulants rather than their native talents. In families and schools,\nmoreover, allowances are often made for those less capable in some\ndomains, like sports or music, in order to compensate for their\ndisadvantages there by enabling them to flourish in others. Affirmative\nAction campaigns, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other civil\nrights policies also attempt to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d\nin ways that compensate for disadvantaging biological differences\nrather than attempting to regulate the differences themselves. If we\nare not interested in policing the enhancement uses of biomedical\ntechnology, we may want to explore whether strategies like these might\nwork to undercut the incentives to enhance in unethical ways.\nOne trap that some authors have fallen into in pursuing this\ncompensatory course is to try to use the enhancement shovel to dig out\nof the enhancement hole. Worried that an unregulated surge in\nbiomedical enhancement might open the door to injustice and social\nharm, some are now arguing that the prerequisite for widespread access\nto enhancement should be the widespread enhancement of our moral\nfaculties. Improved moral discernment and reasoning, keener senses of\nempathy and fairness, and deeper sense of solidarity, it is argued,\nwill help mitigate the potential social harms by insuring that the\nusers of enhancement are equipped to do so responsibly (Tennison, 2012;\nPersson and Savulescu 2012).\nThe irony of this argument, of course, is that accomplishing these\nprerequisite moral upgrades would require a social gate-keeping system\nas intrusive and draconian as any attempts to police the use of\nparticular enhancements themselves (Sparrow 2014b; Harris 2016;\nAzevedo 2016). It would also open to debate the criteria by which such\nmoral upgrades would be made (Joyce 2013; Craigie 2014; Wiseman 2016;\nHauskeller and Coyne 2018; Johnson, Bishop and Toner 2019; Paulo and\nBublitz 2019). Would we still allow the enhanced to follow normal\nviews of when the obligatory becomes supererogatory, or expect more of\nthem?  Presumably, we need not aspire to require superhuman virtues,\nsuch as angels might possess. But should they at least be saints?\nAgainst whose account of sainthood? Once again, the panorama of\nalternative philosophical traditions opens up for exploration down\nthis road, offering no quick resolution for policy.\nHowever, it is worth remembering at this point that particular\nbiomedical enhancements will never yield comprehensive improvements in\nmoral character, if only because moral character is not reducible to\nits biological substrates in people\u2019s brains and\ngenes. Instead, enhancement will at best be able to change\nspecific biological functions in ways that improve the chances that a\nperson will act in a particular manner, like telling the truth, at the\nexpense of reducing the chances of some other reaction, like lying,\nwhich, in particular circumstances, may actually be the more virtuous\nthing to do. This piecemeal, double-edged feature of biomedical\nenhancement means that every morally enhancing intervention runs the\nrisk of being a morally disabling intervention at the same\ntime.\nThis point suggests a third observation from our review: despite\nthe claims of its defenders, biomedical enhancement is not a practice\nthat is not always especially well-suited to a melioristic ethic aimed\nat improving human welfare. Often a step forward for some purposes is\nalso a step back in other contexts. Many enhanced people are\ncorrespondingly disabled, and so by extension are their teams,\nfamilies, communities, etc. Consider, for example, an enhancement that\nmakes our reflexes faster.  Such an enhancement might increase the\nrisk of making mistakes in ways that would be considered an acceptable\ntrade-off for military pilots on solo combat missions, but not for\ncommercial pilots ferrying hundreds of passengers. If our policies\nwere to focus on reminding us that most enhancements come with\ntrade-offs, we might be able to orient our public policy away from\neither regulatory or compensatory approaches keyed to\n\u201cenhancement\u201d in the abstract, and towards the specific\nsocial and institutional contexts in which particular enhancement\ninterventions might be considered too risky or unfair.  Should, for\nexample, the Air Force consider the post-service consequences of a\nhyper-reflex enhancement for pilots in deciding whether to adopt such\nan intervention? Should enhanced veterans be able to claim\naccommodation from employers for their service-induced\nhyper-responsiveness?\nFocusing on trade-offs does not imply that no change is the best\npolicy; there is nothing sacred about the biology we inherit. Some\nenhancements may well be worth attendant deficits in particular\nsituations for particular individuals. But just as our inherited\nbiology provides no definitive criteria for \u201chuman nature\u201d\nthat can be used to curtail enhancement, enhancement cannot take our\nfuture biology down any path that offers unequivocal improvement in\nthe human condition.\nBut would a pluralistic and piecemeal approach to governing the\nenhancement uses of medical technologies serve the broader needs of\ndistributive justice with respect to enhancement interventions that\nare deemed acceptable in particular settings? As the enhanced use\ntheir improved capacities to gain power, wealth and status, justice\nmight require that access to those enhancements be afforded more\nbroadly, at least for those willing to bear the corresponding deficits\n(Sparrow 2016). Some authors have argued that a fair system of\nallocating enhancement opportunities will require a centralized,\nglobal agency akin to the World Trade Organization or the\nInternational Monetary Fund, capable of adjudicating all the interests\ninvolved (Buchanan 2011). But the assumption behind such proposals\nremains that \u201cenhancements\u201d will always give people\nfungible advantages over others, like wealth does. It remains to be\nseen how true this is.\nUnderstanding that enhancements are specific, often double-edged\nchanges\u2014beneficial in some settings for some purposes but not in\nothers\u2014suggests that a better analogy here may be the governance\nof health care itself. Good health care on the one hand and\npower, wealth and status on the other are positively correlated,\nthrough the expanded opportunity range that meeting specific health\nneeds can provide. That correlation helps support the case for\nequitable access to health care. But not all health care needs are\nequally \u201cprofitable\u201d in leveraging other social goods, and\nit is not the goal of a needs-based health care system to address\nthat disparity. Just as a fair system of health care\nshould be able to provide need-based access to specific therapeutic\ninterventions, a fair biomedical enhancement allocation system should\nbe geared to needs of people facing particular life challenges. In\nfact, in the end, as this tour of the enhancement literature suggests,\nwith sufficient renegotiation of the boundaries of health care, it\ncould be the same system. Again, the task of realizing\nsuch a system will continue to be daunting. But it is doubtful that\nthis will require a Brave New World of centralized global moral\nenhancement schemes: instead, managing our emerging biomedical\nenhancement abilities begins with the tedious real world tasks of\nlearning to live with human difference and meet human needs.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Agar, N., 2004. <em>Liberal Eugenics: In Defense of Human\nEnhancement</em>, Malden: Blackwell.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2013. <em>Humanity\u2019s End: Why We\nShould Reject Radical Enhancement</em>, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.", "Allhoff, F., Lin, P., Moor, J., and Weckert, J.,\n2009. \u201cEthics of human enhancement: 25 questions &amp;\nanswers\u201d, version 1.0.1., US National Science\nFoundation.
