    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Judgment: Transcendental Idealism || Judgment, transcendental idealism, and truth\n3.1 Judgment, transcendental idealism, and truth\n\nTranscendental idealism is the conjunction of two theses: (1)\ncognitive idealism, which says that all the proper objects of\nhuman cognition are nothing but mind-dependent sensory appearances or\nphenomena, not things-in-themselves or noumena (A369), and (2)\nrepresentational transcendentalism , which says that all\nrepresentations and their contents necessarily conform to the forms or\nstructures of our innate spontaneous cognitive capacities (Bxvi,\nA11/B25) (4: 373 n.). There are weaker and stronger interpretations of\nthese theses (see, e.g., Allais 2015), but in any case transcendental\nidealism in its strongest version directly entails that all\nthe objects of human experience are token-identical with\nobjectively-valid sensory representational contents:\n\nYou put the matter quite precisely when you say The content\n(Innbegriff) of a representation is itself the object; and\nthe activity of the mind whereby the content of a representation is\nrepresented is what is meant by \u2018referring to the object. (11:\n314)\n\n\nLonguenesse aptly dubs this Kantian thesis \u201cthe internalization\nto representation of the object of representation\u201d (Longuenesse\n1998, 20, 108). But perhaps even more importantly, Kant\u2019s\n\u201cinternalization to representation of the object of\nrepresentation\u201d entails that all the basic phenomenal forms or\nstructures of those objects of experience are type-identical with the\nforms or structures introduced into representations by the innately\npre-programmed spontaneous operations of our cognitive faculties, and\nin particular with the spatiotemporal structures of our subjective\nforms of sensory intuition. Indeed, Kant explicitly holds that space\nand time are nothing but our subjective forms of intuition,\nwhich is his controversial thesis of \u201cthe transcendental\nideality of space and time\u201d (A28\u201330/B44\u201345,\nA36/B52\u201353, A42\u201343/B59\u201360). The upshot is that\naccording to the strongest version of transcendental idealism, all the\nobjects of human experience are nothing but what we represent them\nto be, when we represent sensory objects according to the a priori\nnormative principles of our understanding and our reason: so our\ncognition does not conform to the objects we cognize, rather those\nobjects necessarily conform to our innate a priori\nnormatively-governed faculties of cognition (Bxvi,\nA92/B125\u2013126).\n\nNow assume that this strongest version of transcendental idealism is\ncorrect. Then add to this assumption Kant\u2019s centrality thesis,\nto the effect that judgment is the central human cognitive faculty,\nand also the priority-of-the-proposition thesis. It follows\nimmediately that all the objects of human experience are\ntoken-identical with the propositional contents of objectively\nvalid empirical judgments, and also that all the basic phenomenal\nforms or structures of objects of human experience are type-identical\nwith the spatiotemporal and logico-syntactic and logico-semantic forms\nor structures that are inherent in the propositional contents of\nempirical judgments, which we can now see to be forms or structures\nthat have been introduced directly into nature by the acts of the\ncognitive faculties of sensibility, imagination, understanding,\napperception, and reason, which are all brought together and fused\nin the unifying act of judgment or thought . In short, the\nstrongest version of Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism is also a\njudgment-based idealism, according to which actual or\nnon-actual/merely possible empirical objects or states-of-affairs are\nnothing but true or false empirical propositions, and according to\nwhich the basic phenomenal contours of the world we cognize are\nprecisely the same as the innate intuitional, formal-syntactic, and\nsemantic contours of the several cognitive faculties that jointly\ngenerate our judgments.\n\nKant\u2019s judgment-based idealism has some crucial consequences for\nhis theory of truth. If the strongest version of transcendental\nidealism is correct, then to every true empirical judgment there\nnecessarily corresponds an actual empirical fact, and conversely, and\nalso to every true a priori judgment there necessarily corresponds\nsome objectively real conceptually-represented or\nintuitionally-represented structure across a complete set of logically\nor experientially possible worlds. What this means is that whereas\nKant\u2019s theory of truth is explicitly realistic at the empirical\nlevel\u2014which is what he calls his \u201cempirical realism\u201d\n(A28/B44, A35/B52, A370\u2013373)\u2014in that actual empirical\nfacts or modal facts (whether these are conceptually-represented\nlogical world-structures or intuitionally-represented non-logical\nworld-structures) always present themselves as in some irreducible\nrespects external or extrinsic to our cognition, and therefore not\ncontrolled by us, nevertheless at the transcendental level his theory\nof truth is fully anti-realistic: transcendentally speaking, we\nimpose truth upon the world . In short, the strongest version\nof transcendental idealism plus the centrality thesis plus the\npriority-of-the-proposition thesis jointly necessarily\nguarantee that all and only the cognitively well-generated judgments\nare true. This is what Kant calls the \u201ctranscendental\ntruth\u201d of judgments (A146/B185). Transcendental falsity, by\ncontrast, is always the result of some special idiosyncrasy or\naccidental glitch in the cognitive generation of a given judgment, and\nthus represents a mere \u201cperformance error\u201d in the\noperation of our cognitive faculties, and not a gap in our\ntranscendental cognitive \u201ccompetence.\u201d Thus any sort of\nserious skepticism at the transcendental level of Kant\u2019s theory\nof judgment is automatically ruled out of court.\n",
