    "main_text": "Varieties of Desires || Stronger and Weaker Desires\n2.3 Stronger and Weaker Desires\n\n\nIt is generally held that desires come on a continuum of\nstrength: desires can be stronger or weaker. The strength of a\ndesire is typically said to be constituted by the desire's causal\npower regarding the control of action: for one desire to be stronger\nthan another is for the agent to be disposed to act upon it, rather than\nthe second desire, in a situation in which (a) all else is equal, and\n(b) the agent believes that each desire is satisfiable by a distinct\naction, and (c) the agent believes that the desires are not jointly\nsatisfiable. This way of characterizing desire strength is obviously\nmost suited to an action-based theory of desire. But for each theory of\ndesire there is a corresponding theory of desire strength available.\nDesire strength could be determined by the amount of pleasure or\ndispleasure apparent satisfaction of the desire would bring, or by the\ndegree to which a state of affairs seems good, or by the degree to\nwhich one's attention is drawn to the reasons to bring some state\nof affairs about, or by the amount of reward-based learning apparent\nsatisfaction of the desire would cause, or by some average of all of\nthese.\n\n\nMost theorists have little more to say about desire strength than\nwhat appears above. An exception is found in the work of decision\ntheorists: within decision theory, preference is given a formal\ncharacterization, and through this formal characterization, various\nresults can be proven. A foundational result about desire strength is\nthat, if a minimally rational person has set of pairwise preferences\n(for A over B, for C over D, and so on), these pairwise preferences can\nbe used to determine the strengths of preferences. That is, from a\nlarge set of basic facts about what is preferred to what, facts about\nhow much each thing must be preferred to the other can be derived\n(e.g., von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944).\n\n\nOne puzzle for most theories of desire strength is that desires seem\nto vary in their power to manifest the typical signs of strength even\nwhen it would seem that there is no variation in how much their ends\nare wanted. Think of a standard intrinsic desire: a desire for the\nwelfare of a child. My disposition to act so as to benefit Cecilia\nmight well be stronger when I am in a good mood than when I am feeling\nlow, it might well be stronger when I am wide awake than when I am very\nsleepy, might well be stronger when the change in welfare will happen\nright now rather than in a month, and so on. These changes in\ndisposition seem unlikely to mark changes in how much I desire\nCecelia's welfare, however. Rather, they would seem to mark\nchanges in how effectively my desire is poised to influence my actions.\nSimilarly, the idea of certain harms to Cecelia's welfare will\nmake me feel terrible (the idea of her being bitten by a dog, say)\nwhile others will make me feel less terrible (the idea of her getting\nchicken pox, say), even while my estimation of the harm to her welfare\nmight make the two scenarios quite similar. Again, this would seem to\nindicate some idiosyncrasy in how effectively my desire is poised to\ninfluence my feelings, rather than indicating a difference in strength\nof desire (in this case, getting chicken pox seems like an expected\nordeal of childhood, and that seems to blunt my felt response). And\nlikewise for appearances of goodness and dispositions to pay\nattention.\n\n\nAn advantage shared by learning-based theories and holistic theories\nof desire is that they are, in a natural way, able to hold that the\nstrength of a desire can be a constant even while the effect of the\ndesire on action, feelings, or thoughts seems disproportionate to the\ndesire's strength. In the case of learning-based theories of\ndesire, so long as there is a merely causal relation between the\nlearning signal and the ordinary signs of desire strength, there is no\ncontradiction in holding that a strong desire has effects like those of\na weak desire, or vice versa. In the case of holistic theories, so long\nas desire strength is not reduced to strength of a single phenomenon,\nthere is no contradiction in holding that a strong desire has one or a\nfew effects like those of a weak desire, or vice versa. It is when\ntheories reduce desires to a single observable core phenomenon that\napparently meaningless fluctuations in that phenomenon pose a\nproblem.\n",
