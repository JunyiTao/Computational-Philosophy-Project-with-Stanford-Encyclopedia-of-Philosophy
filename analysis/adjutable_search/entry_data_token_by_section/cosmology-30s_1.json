The Lead-up to the Debate\n\nSince about 1700 theories about the nature and structure of the\nUniverse were derived from Newtonian theory, most especially his\ntheory of gravitation, which was used to account for the behavior of\nheavenly bodies and their systems. Newton\u2019s theory hypothesized\na force\u2014gravitation\u2014acting upon material bodies, free to\nmove over time within the passive, inert \u2018container\u2019 of\nthree-dimensional space. Bodies, paths, and space itself exemplified\nthe classical geometry of Euclid. All these features changed with the\npublication of Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity,\n1915\u201317.\n",
