    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Is QBist Quantum Theory Explanatory?\n2.3 Is QBist Quantum Theory Explanatory?\n\nRealists often appeal to scientific explanation when arguing against\ninstrumentalists. Quantum theory is generally acknowledged to provide\nus with a wide variety of successful explanations of phenomena we\ncan\u2019t explain without it. Timpson (followed by Brown 2019)\nobjects that QBists cannot account for its explanatory success.\n\n\n\u2026 think of the question of why some solids conduct and some\ninsulate; why yet others are in between, while they all contain\nelectrons, sometimes in quite similar densities\u2026. Ultimately we\nare not interested in agents\u2019 expectation that matter structured\nlike sodium would conduct; we are interested in why it in fact\ndoes so. (Timpson 2008: 600)\n\n\nQBists face two problems here. In their view a user of quantum theory\ncan\u2019t appeal to a description of objective, physical quantum\nstates in explaining the phenomena; and quantum theory\u2019s Born\nrule outputs subjective probabilities for each user independently that\nbear not on what is objectively likely to happen but only on what\n(s)he should expect to experience, given her prior beliefs and\nexperiences.\n\nFuchs and Schack (2015) reply that explanations offered by quantum\ntheory have a similar character to explanations offered by probability\ntheory and give examples. This does not address the first problem. But\nQBists could rationalize biting that bullet by pointing to\nlong-standing problems of measurement and non-locality faced by\ninterpretations that take quantum states to be physically real that\ndon\u2019t arise in their view. To respond to the second problem they\ncould try to develop a subjectivist view of scientific explanation as\nultimately a matter of making an economical and effective unity out of\nall an agent\u2019s beliefs and expectations.\n",
