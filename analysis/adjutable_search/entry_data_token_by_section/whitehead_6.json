    "main_text": "Religion\n7. Religion\n\nAs Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy gave rise to the movement of\nprocess theology, most philosophers think that his take on religion\nwas merely positive. This commonplace is wrong. Whitehead wrote:\n\n\nReligion is by no means necessarily good. It may be very evil.\n(1926 [1996: 17])\n\nIn considering religion, we should not be obsessed by the idea of its\nnecessary goodness. This is a dangerous delusion. (1926 [1996:\n18])\n\nIndeed history, down to the present day, is a melancholy record of the\nhorrors which can attend religion: human sacrifice, and in particular,\nthe slaughter of children, cannibalism, sensual orgies, abject\nsuperstition, hatred as between races, the maintenance of degrading\ncustoms, hysteria, bigotry, can all be laid at its charge. Religion is\nthe last refuge of human savagery. The uncritical association of\nreligion with goodness is directly negatived by plain facts.\n(1926 [1996: 37])\n\n\nThis being said, Whitehead didn\u2019t hold that religion is\nmerely negative. To him, religion can be \u201cpositive or\nnegative, good or bad\u201d (1926 [1996: 17]). So after\nhighlighting that the necessary goodness of religion is a dangerous\ndelusion in Religion in the Making, Whitehead abruptly adds:\n\u201cThe point to notice is its transcendent importance\u201d\n(1926 [1996: 18]). In Science and the Modern World,\nWhitehead expresses this transcendent importance of religion as\nfollows:\n\n\nReligion is the vision of something which stands beyond, behind, and\nwithin, the passing flux of immediate things; something which is real,\nand yet waiting to be realized; something which is a remote\npossibility, and yet the greatest of present facts; something that\ngives meaning to all that passes, and yet eludes all apprehension;\nsomething whose possession is the final good, and yet is beyond all\nreach; something which is the ultimate ideal, and the hopeless quest.\n(1925 [1967: 191\u2013192])\n\n\nAnd after pointing out that religion is the last refuge of human\nsavagery in Religion in the Making, Whitehead abruptly adds:\n\u201cReligion can be, and has been, the main instrument for\nprogress\u201d (1926 [1996: 37\u201338]). In Science and\nthe Modern World this message reads:\n\n\nReligion has emerged into human experience mixed with the crudest\nfantasies of barbaric imagination. Gradually, slowly, steadily the\nvision recurs in history under nobler form and with clearer\nexpression. It is the one element in human experience which\npersistently shows an upward trend. It fades and then recurs. But when\nit renews its force, it recurs with an added richness and purity of\ncontent. The fact of the religious vision, and its history of\npersistent expansion, is our one ground for optimism.\n(1925 [1967: 192])\n\n\nWith respect to the relationship between science and religion,\nWhitehead\u2019s view clearly differs from Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s\nview that religion and science do not overlap. Gould wrote:\n\n\nThe lack of conflict between science and religion arises from a lack\nof overlap between their respective domains of professional\nexpertise\u2014science in the empirical constitution of the universe,\nand religion in the search for proper ethical values and the spiritual\nmeaning of our lives. (1997)\n\n\nWhitehead, on the contrary, wrote: \u201cYou cannot shelter theology\nfrom science, or science from theology\u201d (1926 [1996: 79]).\nAnd: \u201cThe conflict between science and religion is what\nnaturally occurs in our minds when we think of this subject\u201d\n(1926 [1967: 181]).\n\nHowever, Whitehead did not agree with those who hold that the ideal\nsolution of the science-religion conflict is the complete annihilation\nof religion. Whitehead, on the contrary, held that we should aim at\nthe integration of science and religion, and turn the impoverishing\nopposition between the two into an enriching contrast. According to\nWhitehead, both religion and science are important, and he wrote:\n\n\nWhen we consider what religion is for mankind, and what science is, it\nis no exaggeration to say that the future course of history depends\nupon the decision of this generation as to the relation between them.\n(1925 [1967: 181])\n\n\nWhitehead never sided with those who, in the name of science, oppose\nreligion with a misplaced and dehumanizing rhetoric of disenchantment,\nnor with those who, in the name of religion, oppose science with a\nmisplaced and dehumanizing exaltation of existent religious dogmas,\ncodes of behavior, institutions, rituals, etc. As Whitehead wrote:\n\u201cThere is the hysteria of depreciation, and there is the\nopposite hysteria which dehumanizes in order to exalt\u201d (1927\n[1985: 91]). Whitehead, on the contrary, urged both scientific and\nreligious leaders to observe \u201cthe utmost toleration of variety\nof opinion\u201d (1925 [1967: 187]) as well as the following\nadvice:\n\n\nEvery age produces people with clear logical intellects, and with the\nmost praiseworthy grip of the importance of some sphere of human\nexperience, who have elaborated, or inherited, a scheme of thought\nwhich exactly fits those experiences which claim their interest. Such\npeople are apt resolutely to ignore, or to explain away, all evidence\nwhich confuses their scheme with contradictory instances. What they\ncannot fit in is for them nonsense. An unflinching determination to\ntake the whole evidence into account is the only method of\npreservation against the fluctuating extremes of fashionable opinion.\nThis advice seems so easy, and is in fact so difficult to follow\n(1925 [1967: 187]).\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s advice of taking the whole evidence into account\nimplies taking the inner life of religion into account and not only\nits external life:\n\n\nLife is an internal fact for its own sake, before it is an external\nfact relating itself to others. The conduct of external life is\nconditioned by environment, but it receives its final quality, on\nwhich its worth depends, from the internal life which is the\nself-realization of existence. Religion is the art and the theory of\nthe internal life of man, so far as it depends on the man himself and\non what is permanent in the nature of things.\n\nThis doctrine is the direct negation of the theory that religion is\nprimarily a social fact. Social facts are of great importance to\nreligion, because there is no such thing as absolutely independent\nexistence. You cannot abstract society from man; most psychology is\nherd-psychology. But all collective emotions leave untouched the awful\nultimate fact, which is the human being, consciously alone with\nitself, for its own sake.\n\nReligion is what the individual does with his own solitariness.\n(1926 [1996: 15\u201316])\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s advice also implies the challenge to continually\nreshape the outer life of religion in accord with the scientific\ndevelopments, while remaining faithful to its inner life. When taking\ninto account science, religion runs the risk of collapsing. Indeed,\nwhile reshaping its outer life, religion can only avoid implosion by\nremaining faithful to its inner life. \u201cReligions commit\nsuicide\u201d, according to Whitehead, when do they not find\n\u201ctheir inspirations \u2026 in the primary expressions of the\nintuitions of the finest types of religious lives\u201d\n(1926 [1996: 144]). And he writes:\n\n\nReligion, therefore, while in the framing of dogmas it must admit\nmodifications from the complete circle of our knowledge, still brings\nits own contribution of immediate experience. (1926 [1996:\n79\u201380])\n\n\nOn the other hand, when religion shelters itself from the complete\ncircle of knowledge, it also faces \u201cdecay\u201d and, Whitehead\nadds, \u201cthe Church will perish unless it opens its window\u201d\n(1926 [1996: 146]). So there really is no alternative. But that\ndoes not render the task at hand any easier.\n\nWhitehead lists two necessary, but not sufficient, requirements for\nreligious leaders to reshape, again and again, the outer expressions\nof their inner experiences: First, they should stop exaggerating the\nimportance of the outer life of religion. Whitehead writes:\n\n\nCollective enthusiasms, revivals, institutions, churches, rituals,\nbibles, codes of behavior, are the trappings of religion, its passing\nforms. They may be useful, or harmful; they may be authoritatively\nordained, or merely temporary expedients. But the end of religion is\nbeyond all this. (1926 [1996: 17])\n\n\nSecondly, they should learn from scientists how to deal with continual\nrevision. Whitehead writes:\n\n\nWhen Darwin or Einstein proclaim theories which modify our ideas, it\nis a triumph for science. We do not go about saying that there is\nanother defeat for science, because its old ideas have been abandoned.\nWe know that another step of scientific insight has been gained.\n\nReligion will not regain its old power until it can face change in the\nsame spirit as does science. Its principles may be eternal, but the\nexpression of those principles requires continual development. This\nevolution of religion is in the main a disengagement of its own proper\nideas in terms of the imaginative picture of the world entertained in\nprevious ages. Such a release from the bonds of imperfect science is\nall to the good. (1925 [1967: 188\u2013189])\n\n\nIn this respect, Whitehead offers the following example:\n\n\nThe clash between religion and science, which has relegated the earth\nto the position of a second-rate planet attached to a second-rate sun,\nhas been greatly to the benefit of the spirituality of religion by\ndispersing [a number of] medieval fancies. (1925 [1967: 190])\n\n\nOn the other hand, Whitehead is well aware that religion more often\nfails than succeeds in this respect, and he writes, for example, that\nboth\n\n\nChristianity and Buddhism \u2026 have suffered from the rise of\n\u2026 science, because neither of them had \u2026 the requisite\nflexibility of adaptation. (1926 [1996: 146])\n\n\nIf the condition of mutual tolerance is satisfied, then, according to\nWhitehead: \u201cA clash of doctrines is not a disaster\u2014it is\nan opportunity\u201d (1925 [1967: 186]). In other words, if this\ncondition is satisfied, then the clash between religion and science is\nan opportunity on the path toward their integration or, as Whitehead\nputs it:\n\n\nThe clash is a sign that there are wider truths and finer perspectives\nwithin which a reconciliation of a deeper religion and a more subtle\nscience will be found. (1925 [1967: 185])\n\n\nAccording to Whitehead, the task of philosophy is \u201cto absorb\ninto one system all sources of experience\u201d (1926 [1996:\n149]), including the intuitions at the basis of both science and\nreligion, and in Religion in the Making, he expresses the\nbasic religious intuition as follows:\n\n\nThere is a quality of life which lies always beyond the mere fact of\nlife; and when we include the quality in the fact, there is still\nomitted the quality of the quality. It is not true that the finer\nquality is the direct associate of obvious happiness or obvious\npleasure. Religion is the direct apprehension that, beyond such\nhappiness and such pleasure remains the function of what is actual and\npassing, that it contributes its quality as an immortal fact to the\norder which informs the world. (1926 [1996: 80])\n\n\nThe first aspect of this dual intuition that \u201cour existence is\nmore than a succession of bare facts\u201d (idem) is that the quality\nor value of each of the successive occasions of life derives from a\nfiner quality or value, which lies beyond the mere facts of life, and\neven beyond obvious happiness and pleasure, namely, the finer quality\nor value of which life is informed by God. The second aspect is that\neach of the successive occasions of life contributes its quality or\nvalue as an immortal fact to God.\n\nIn Process and Reality, Whitehead absorbed this dual\nreligious intuition in terms of the bipolar\u2014primordial and\nconsequent\u2014nature of God.\n\nGod viewed as primordial does not determine the becoming of each\nactual occasion, but conditions it (cf. supra\u2014the initial\nsubjective aim). He does not force, but tenderly persuades each actual\noccasion to actualize\u2014from \u201cthe absolute wealth of\npotentiality\u201d (1929c [1985: 343)\u2014value-potentials relevant\nfor that particular becoming. \u201cGod\u201d, according to\nWhitehead, \u201cis the poet of the world, with tender patience\nleading it by his vision of truth, beauty, and goodness\u201d (1929c\n[1985: 346]).\n\n\u201cThe ultimate evil in the temporal world\u201d, Whitehead\nwrites,\n\n\nlies in the fact that the past fades, that time is a \u201cperpetual\nperishing.\u201d \u2026 In the temporal world, it is the empirical\nfact that process entails loss. (1929c [1985: 340])\n\n\nIn other words, from a merely factual point of view, \u201chuman life\nis a flash of occasional enjoyments lighting up a mass of pain and\nmisery, a bagatelle of transient experience\u201d (1925 [1967:\n192]). According to Whitehead, however, this is not the whole story.\nOn 8 April 1928, while preparing the Gifford Lectures that became\nProcess and Reality, Whitehead wrote to Rosalind Greene:\n\n\nI am working at my Giffords. The problem of problems which bothers me,\nis the real transitoriness of things\u2014and yet!!\u2014I am\nequally convinced that the great side of things is weaving something\nageless and immortal: something in which personalities retain the\nwonder of their radiance\u2014and the fluff sinks into utter\ntriviality. But I cannot express it at all\u2014no system of words\nseems up to the job. (Unpublished letter archived by the Whitehead\nResearch Project)\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s attempt to express it in Process and\nReality reads:\n\n\nThere is another side to the nature of God which cannot be omitted.\n\u2026 God, as well as being primordial, is also consequent \u2026\nGod is dipolar. (1929c [1985: 345])\n\nThe consequent nature of God is his judgment on the world. He saves\nthe world as it passes into the immediacy of his own life. It is the\njudgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved. (1929c\n[1985: 346])\n\nThe consequent nature of God is the fluent world become\n\u2018everlasting\u2019 \u2026 in God. (1929c [1985: 347])\n\n\nWhitehead\u2019s dual description of God as tender persuader\nand tender savior reveals his affinity with \u201cthe\nGalilean origin of Christianity\u201d (1929c [1985: 343]). Indeed,\nhis\n\n\ntheistic philosophy \u2026 does not emphasize the ruling Caesar, or\nthe ruthless moralist, or the unmoved mover. It dwells upon the tender\nelements in the world, which slowly and in quietness operate by love.\n(idem)\n\n\nOne of the major reasons why Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy is\npopular among theologians, and gave rise to process theology, is the\nfact that it helps to overcome the doctrine of an omnipotent God\ncreating everything out of nothing. This creatio ex nihilo\ndoctrine implies God\u2019s responsibility for everything that is\nevil, and also that God is the only ultimate reality. In other words,\nit prevents the reconciliation of divine love and human suffering as\nwell as the reconciliation of the various religious traditions, for\nexample, theistic Christianity and nontheistic Buddhism. In yet other\nwords, the creatio ex nihilo doctrine is a stumbling block\nfor theologians involved in theodicy or interreligious dialogue.\nContrary to it, Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy holds that there\nare three ultimate (but inseparable) aspects of total reality: God\n(the divine actual entity), the world (the universe of all finite\nactual occasions), and the creativity (the twofold power to exert\nefficient and final causation) that God and all finite actual\noccasions embody. The distinction between God and creativity (that God\nis not the only instance of creativity) implies that there is no God\nwith the power completely to determine the becoming of all actual\noccasions in the world\u2014they are instances of creativity too. In\nthis sense, God is not omnipotent, but can be conceived as \u201cthe\nfellow-sufferer who understands\u201d (1929c [1985: 351]). Moreover,\nthe Whiteheadian doctrine of three ultimates\u2014the one supreme\nbeing or God, the many finite beings or the cosmos, and being itself\nor creativity\u2014also implies a religious pluralism that holds that\nthe different kinds of religious experience are (not experiences of\nthe same ultimate reality, but) diverse modes of experiencing diverse\nultimate aspects of the totality of reality. For example:\n\n\nOne of these [three ultimates], corresponding with what Whitehead\ncalls \u201ccreativity\u201d, has been called\n\u201cEmptiness\u201d (\u201cSunyata\u201d) or\n\u201cDharmakaya\u201d by Buddhists, \u201cNirguna Brahman\u201d\nby Advaita Vedantists, \u201cthe Godhead\u201d by Meister Eckhart,\nand \u201cBeing Itself\u201d by Heidegger and Tillich (among\nothers). It is the formless ultimate reality. The other\nultimate, corresponding with what Whitehead calls \u201cGod\u201d,\nis not Being Itself but the Supreme Being. It is in-formed\nand the source of forms (such as truth, beauty, and justice). It has\nbeen called \u201cAmida Buddha\u201d, \u201cSambhogakaya\u201d,\n\u201cSaguna Brahman\u201d, \u201cIshvara\u201d,\n\u201cYaweh\u201d, \u201cChrist\u201d, and \u201cAllah\u201d.\n(D. Griffin 2005: 47)\n\n[Some] forms of Taoism and many primal religions, including Native\nAmerican religions [\u2026] regard the cosmos as sacred. By\nrecognizing the cosmos as a third ultimate, we are able to see that\nthese cosmic religions are also oriented toward something truly\nultimate in the nature of things. (D. Griffin 2005: 49)\n\n\nThe religious pluralism implication of Whitehead\u2019s doctrine of\nthree ultimates has been drawn most clearly by John Cobb. In\n\u201cJohn Cobb\u2019s Whiteheadian Complementary Pluralism\u201d,\nDavid Griffin writes:\n\n\nCobb\u2019s view that the totality of reality contains three\nultimates, along with the recognition that a particular tradition\ncould concentrate on one, two, or even all three of them, gives us a\nbasis for understanding a wide variety of religious experiences as\ngenuine responses to something that is really there to be experienced.\n\u201cWhen we understand global religious experience and thought in\nthis way\u201d, Cobb emphasizes, \u201cit is easier to view the\ncontributions of diverse traditions as complementary\u201d.
