    "main_text": "The Status of Instrumental Rationality || Hume on Instrumental Rationality\n4.4 Kant on Hypothetical Imperatives\n\nAn alternative to the narrow instrumentalism associated with Hume is\nfound in the work of Immanuel Kant, who thought that rationality\nrequired us not only to be instrumentally rational, but also to obey\nthe moral law. In his Groundwork for the Metaphysics of\nMorals (1785), Kant distinguishes two kinds of imperatives:\n\nNow all imperatives command either hypothetically or categorically.\nThe former represent the practical necessity of a possible action as a\nmeans for attaining something else one wants (or may possibly want).\nThe categorical imperative would be one which represented an action as\nobjectively necessary in itself, without reference to another end.\n(4:414\u2014citations use volume and pages from the Akademie Edition)\n\n\nFor example, \u201cIf you intend to go to law school, take the\nLSAT\u201d would be a hypothetical imperative since it commands an\naction (taking the LSAT) as a means to some end (going to law school).\nIf you didn\u2019t have any ends that would be served by taking the\nLSAT, the command for you to do so would be withdrawn. Categorical\nimperatives, such as \u201cIf someone is drowning nearby, offer\nassistance,\u201d differ in two ways. First, the command to offer\nassistance applies to you regardless of whether offering assistance\nserves any of your (desired or intended) ends. Second, you have a\nreason to offer assistance regardless of whether doing so serves any\nof your (desired or intended) ends. (Philippa Foot has argued that\nthis second feature doesn\u2019t follow from the first: a rule of\netiquette, or a club rule, may apply to you regardless of whether\ncompliance with it serves any of your ends, but you may nonetheless\nhave no reason to comply with it. See Foot 1972.)\n\nBy \u201cone wants\u201d in the passage above, Kant means \u201cone\nwills\u201d: something closer to \u201cone intends\u201d than\n\u201cone desires.\u201d (After all, it wouldn\u2019t be plausible\nto suggest that one is instrumentally irrational in not intending the\nnecessary means to what one merely wants. I want to own a\nBMW, but I don\u2019t intend to work the kind of job that would allow\nme to buy one. But there\u2019s nothing incoherent about my\ncontinuing to desire to own one.) According to Kant:\n\nHow an imperative of skill is possible requires no special discussion.\nWhoever will the end, wills (so far as reason has decisive influence\non his actions) also the means that are indispensably necessary to his\nactions and that lie in his power. This proposition, as far as willing\nis concerned, is analytic. (4:417)\n\n\nBut if Kant\u2019s view is to provide a plausible account of\ninstrumental coherence, it should instead refer to the means\nbelieved to be indispensably necessary, since there is\nnothing incoherent about not willing necessary means of which you are\nunaware, and something incoherent about not willing the means you\nbelieve are necessary, even when they actually aren\u2019t (Korsgaard\n1997, 236).\n\nKant\u2019s parenthetical remark in the passage above is important.\nFor Kant, when one fails to will the necessary means to one\u2019s\nends, then reason has failed to have decisive influence. In other\nwords, one is irrationally incoherent. Less guardedly, Kant says\n\u201cthe proposition (if I fully will the effect, then I will the\naction required of it) is analytic\u201d (4:417). But it is puzzling\nhow this proposition could be analytic. If it were analytic, then it\nwould be conceptually impossible to be instrumentally\nincoherent since whenever one doesn\u2019t will the means, then one\ndoesn\u2019t will the end. (For defense of this conceptual\nimpossibility, see Finlay 2009 and Lee 2022.) And if it\u2019s\nconceptually impossible to be instrumentally incoherent, we\u2019d be\nunable to make sense of why Kant formulates his account of\ninstrumental incoherence in terms of imperatives, which, on\nKant\u2019s view, are commands addressed to a will that is capable of\nboth following and not following the commands (Kant 1785, 4:414; Hill\n1973, 430; Korsgaard 1997, 236). So, perhaps we should read\nKant\u2019s claim as that if one wills the end, rationality\nrequires that one will the means. (For an alternative reading,\nsee Lee 2018.)\n\nEven so, there is a debate over the interpretation of Kant\u2019s\nclaim, particularly about the logical scope of \u201crequires.\u201d\nAccording to the wide-scope interpretation of Kant\u2019s claim, what\nreason requires is that one either will the means or\nnot will the end. In contrast, according the narrow-scope\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s claim, if one wills the end, then what\nreason requires is that one will the means. The wide-scope\ninterpretation posits a disjunctive requirement (that one either not\nwill the end or will the means) that, like Kant\u2019s categorical\nimperative, applies to every rational agent, regardless of\nthe particular ends she wills. But it\u2019s hard to square the\nexistence of such a universally applicable requirement with some other\nclaims Kant makes about how hypothetical imperatives are to be\ndistinguished from categorical ones, and how hypothetical imperatives\ncould be derived from an analysis of the concept of willing an end.\n(See Schroeder 2005b. For a defense of the wide-scope interpretation\nagainst Schroeder\u2019s objections, see Rippon 2014. For a related\ndiscussion of these issues, see Schwartz 2008.)\n\nBut the narrow-scope interpretation appears to leave Kant\u2019s view\nvulnerable to \u201cdetachment\u201d objections. Suppose you will\nsome immoral end but, irrationally, don\u2019t will the immoral means\nyou believe necessary to carry out this immoral end. On the\nnarrow-scope interpretation, reason would require that you will the\nimmoral means. But that seems implausible. At the very least, it would\nlead to something Kant wouldn\u2019t accept: reason issuing\ncontradictory commands. Your willing the immoral means would be\nrequired by a hypothetical imperative but forbidden by the categorical\nimperative (Hill 1973, 436).\n\nKant could avoid the detachment problem if he holds, as some\ninterpreters claim, that it is impossible to will (Wille)\nimmoral ends (Schroeder 2005b, \u00a73). If this interpretation is\nright, then reason would never require one to will immoral means. But\nit would also leave Kant without an account of instrumental\nincoherence, at least as we have been understanding it. After all,\nagents can display instrumental incoherence in the pursuit of\nboth moral and immoral ends. To use Kant\u2019s own\nexamples, the doctor who doesn\u2019t intend the means believed\nnecessary to making his patient healthy is instrumentally incoherent\nin the same way as is the poisoner who doesn\u2019t intend the means\nbelieved necessary to kill his victim (4:415). So, this interpretation\nwould have Kant avoiding the detachment objection, but at the cost of\nno longer presenting an account of instrumental incoherence that holds\nregardless of whether the end is reasonable or good.\n\nLet\u2019s now turn to Kant\u2019s explanation of the normative\nauthority of hypothetical imperatives. While Kant presents a\ncomplicated and intricate argument to explain the normative authority\nof the categorical imperative, he claims that hypothetical imperatives\nrequire \u201cno special discussion,\u201d and spends comparatively\nlittle time discussing them (4:417). Kant\u2019s approach\nhere\u2014which might seem to play into the hands of instrumentalists\n(see\n \u00a74.1\n above) who, while skeptical of the rational authority of the\ncategorical imperative, follow Kant in thinking that the authority of\nhypothetical imperatives is obvious and unproblematic\u2014has been\nchallenged. Although the \u201cought\u201d of a hypothetical\nimperative is contingent on an agent\u2019s ends, that\n\u201cought\u201d still needs to be explained. Additionally,\nit\u2019s not clear that a hypothetical \u201cought\u201d is any\nmore compatible with a naturalistic worldview than a categorical one.\nSpecifically, some of the same metaethical challenges that have been\nraised about the status of the categorical \u201cought\u201d could\nbe raised about normative claims in general, including the\nhypothetical \u201cought\u201d (Hampton 1998, Ch. 4; Shafer-Landau\n2006, \u00a76).\n\nSo, what is Kant\u2019s explanation of the normative authority of\nhypothetical imperatives? According to Korsgaard (1997), Kant\u2019s\nviews changed over the course of his philosophical development.\nKant\u2019s early \u201cdogmatic rationalist\u201d view (evident in\nthe Groundwork) held that we should comply with these\nhypothetical imperatives simply because they express what a perfectly\nrational agent would do. But the mature Kantian view\u2014which\nKorsgaard endorses\u2014explains the normative authority of\nhypothetical imperatives in terms of the commitments that are\nconstitutive of willing. According to this view, what\u2019s involved\nin willing some end (as opposed to merely desiring it) is\nbeing committed to taking the means to that end. It\u2019s not that\ncomplying with this commitment is constitutive of intention\n(this would render instrumental irrationality conceptually impossible)\nbut that having this commitment is constitutive of intention.\nSo, when one is instrumentally irrational, one fails to live up to\none\u2019s own commitments. Korsgaard writes:\n\n\u2026willing an end just is committing yourself to realizing the\nend. Willing an end, in other words, is an essentially first-personal\nand normative act. To will an end is to give oneself a law, hence, to\ngovern oneself. \u2026 What is constitutive of willing the end is\n\u2026 the inward, volitional act of prescribing the end along with\nthe means it requires to yourself. (Korsgaard 1997, 245)\n\n\nBut is Korsgaard right that willing an end necessarily involves\nprescribing that end to yourself? Korsgaard argues that to\nwill some end, you must at least take that end to be good in some\nsense, and you must also think that there is a reason for pursuing\nthat end (246, 250\u20131). But it seems possible for one to have\nsome akratic end while failing to see anything even pro tanto\ngood about it, or any reason to pursue it (Wallace 2006, \u00a71). And\nit\u2019s clear that one could display instrumental rationality or\nirrationality relative to these akratic ends. So, Korsgaard\u2019s\nview seems unable to explain the authority of instrumental rationality\nwith respect to such ends\u2014ends that an agent has but\ndoesn\u2019t prescribe to herself.\n\nKorsgaard offers a second Kantian explanation of the authority of\ninstrumental rationality. She argues that incessant instrumental\nirrationality threatens one\u2019s status as an agent:\n\nSo the reason that I must conform to the instrumental principle is\nthat if I don\u2019t conform to it, if I always allow myself\nto be derailed by timidity, idleness, or depression, then I never\nreally will an end. The desire to pursue the end and\nthe desires that draw me away from it each hold sway in their turn,\nbut my will is never active. The distinction between my will\nand the operation of the desires and impulses in me does not exist and\nthat means that I, considered as an agent, do not exist. (1997, 247)\n\n\nBut this argument doesn\u2019t provide a reason to conform to the\ninstrumental principle in every case in which the instrumental\nprinciple is applicable. Rather, it provides a reason to do so only\nwhen accompanied by enough other instances of non-conformity to\nthreaten one\u2019s status as an agent (Kolodny 2005, 544; Shaver\n2006, 342). So, like the previous Kantian argument, and like the\nHume\u2019s skepticism discussed in\n \u00a74.3,\n this argument also fails to explain why instrumental rationality\napplies in every case in which it does.\n",
