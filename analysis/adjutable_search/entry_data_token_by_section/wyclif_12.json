    "main_text": "Theology || The Eucharist\n4.3 The Eucharist\n\nWyclif\u2019s heretical theses concerning the Eucharist are the\nlogical consequence of the application of this philosophical apparatus\nto the problem of the real presence of the body of Christ in the\nconsecrated host. According to Catholic doctrine, after consecration\nthe body of Christ is really present in the host instead of the\nsubstance of the host itself, while the accidents of the host are the\nsame as before. St. Thomas\u2019s explanation of this process, called\n\u2018transubstantiation\u2019, was that the substance of the bread\n(and wine) was changed into the body (and blood) of Christ, whereas\nits quantity, through which the substance of the bread received\nphysical extension and the other accidental forms, was now the entity\nthat kept the other accidental forms physically in being. Duns Scotus\nand Ockham, on the contrary, had claimed that after consecration the\nsubstance of the bread (and wine) was annihilated by God, while the\naccidents of the bread (and wine) remained the same as before because\nof an intervention of divine omnipotence.\n\nWyclif rejects both solutions as well as the Catholic formulation of\nthe dogma, since he could not accept the ideas of the destruction of a\nsubstance by God and of the existence of the accidents of a given\nsingular substance without and apart from that singular substance\nitself \u2014 two evident absurdities within the metaphyisical\nframework of his system of thought. As a consequence, Wyclif affirms\nthe simultaneous presence in the Eucharist of the body of Crhist and\nof the substance of the bread (and wine), which continues to exist\neven after the consecration. According to him, transubstantiation is\ntherefore a twofold process, natural and supernatural. There is\nnatural transubstantiation when a substitution of one substantial form\nfor another takes place, but the subject-matter remains the same. This\nis the case with water that becomes wine. There is supernatural\ntransubstantiation when a miraculous transformation of the substantial\nentity at issue takes place. This was the case, for instance, with the\nincarnation of the second person of the Trinity, who is God and became\nman (De apostasia, p. 170). The Eucharist implies this second\nkind of transubstantiation, since the Eucharist, like Christ, has a\ndual nature: earthly and divine. According to its earthly nature the\nEucharist is bread (and wine), but according to its divine nature it\nis the body of Christ, which is present in the host spiritually or in\na habitudinal fashion, since it is in virtue and by means of faith\nonly that it could be received (De apostasia, pp. 180 and\n210; De eucharistia, pp. 17, 19, 51\u201352, and 230; for a\ndescription of the habitudinal presence, see the definition of the\nhabitudinal predication above, Section 2.3 \u2013 on the links\nbetween his realism and his eucharistic doctrine see P.
