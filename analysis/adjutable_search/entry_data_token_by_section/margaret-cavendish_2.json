One of her arguments for\nthis view begins with the assumption that our minds are housed in our\nbodies. She assumes that we are being serious when we say that our\nthinking takes place in the head, and concludes that to the extent to\nwhich we are speaking literally our thoughts must have figure and be\nspatially situated:\n\nI would ask those, that say the Brain has neither sense, reason, nor\nself-motion, and therefore no Perception; but that all proceeds from\nan Immaterial Principle, and an Incorporeal Spirit, distinct from the\nbody, which moveth and actuates corporeal matter; I would fain ask\nthem, I say, where their Immaterial Ideas reside, in what part or\nplace of the Body? \u2026[I]f it [the spirit] have no dimension, how\ncan it be confined in a material\n body?[11]\n\n\nSince \u201c[p]lace [is] an attribute that belongs onely to a\nBody\u201d (Cavendish 1664, 8), minds and their ideas are material.\nThinking does not take place only in the brain, according to\nCavendish. She will argue that it is ubiquitous in nature and that, in\nthe case of a human being, it pervades the brain and the rest of the\nbody.\n\nA related reason that Cavendish offers in favor of the view that\nthinking is material is that\n\nThough Matter might be without Motion, yet Motion cannot be without\nmatter; for it is impossible (in my opinion) that there should be an\nImmaterial Motion in\n Nature.[12]\n\n\nCavendish takes it to be obvious that only material things move. That\nis to say, there is no immaterial motion. She also takes it to be\nobvious that if a person is thinking and their body partakes of\nmotion, their mind partakes of motion as well. In the current day we\nmight be at the airport, thinking about a philosophical question, and\nthen we might continue to think about the question midflight, and then\nwe might finally give the question a rest when we have arrived at our\ndestination. Our thinking took place at the airport, and on the plane,\nand at our final stop. Taking issue with the ancient Greek philosopher\nProtagoras, she writes,\n\nI cannot conceive how it is possible, that \u2026 the Soul, being\nincorporeal, can walk in the air, like a body; for incorporeal beings\ncannot have corporeal actions, no more then corporeal beings can have\nthe actions of incorporeals. (Cavendish 1668d, 368)\n\n\nIf minds do travel, and Cavendish supposes that they do, then they are\nmaterial. Cavendish indeed supposes that minds partake of all kinds of\n motion.[13]\n She holds that the \u201crational\u201d parts of the mind\n\u201cmove freely without Burdens\u201d (Cavendish 1668b, 5) \u2013\nfor example, when the mind quickly assembles an image of an entity.\nIdeas are extremely active in their motions, according to Cavendish,\nand she supposes that only material things move. Note however that in\nholding that ideas move, she does not want to say that they move from\nplace to place. That is because strictly speaking Cavendish does not\nhold that there is such a thing as place or location that bodies\ninhabit. Instead, a body and its place are identical (Cavendish 1668a,\n4). For Cavendish, what it means to say that a body moves will be a\nfunction of its mereological relations to the bodies that surround it\n(Peterman 2019).\n\nIn bringing together the datum that minds move and the premise that\nimmaterial things do not partake of motion, Cavendish anticipates a\nline of argumentation that we later find in Locke:\n\nNo Body can imagine, that his Soul can think, or move a Body at\nOxford, whilst he is at London; and cannot but know,\nthat being united to his Body, it constantly changes place all the\nwhole Journey, between Oxford and London, as the\nCoach, or Horse does, that carries him; and, I think, may be said to\nbe truly all that while in motion\u2026. (Locke 1689, 307)\n\n\nLocke only hints at the conclusion that minds are material, but\nCavendish by contrast is not concerned to pull any\n punches.[14]\n The thesis that matter thinks is an unrevisable element of her\nphilosophical system. It is not an unwelcome appendage but instead is\na straightforward consequence of tenets that she takes to be obvious.\nCavendish is also cornering her opponent into explaining what the\nsense is in which minds move or are housed in our brains if they\nare not material. A figure like Leibniz is comfortable elucidating the\nnature of (immaterial) minds in terms of the language of mirrors,\ndizziness, and spatial perspective (Monadology, sections\n83, 21, 57). Cavendish is insisting that the language of dimension and\nmotion applies to bodies alone.\n\nAn objection of course is that there is something odd in saying that\nminds move or that they are spatial. There are plenty of figures in\nthe history of philosophy who have posited the existence of entities\nthat are not in space, even though these entities still in some way\napply to, or are a part of, everyday objects. Most famous, perhaps, is\nPlato\u2019s positing of the existence of numbers, perfect geometrical\nfigures, and other universal entities. Here Cavendish and her\nopponents are presumably at loggerheads. There may be something odd\nabout saying that minds move, she would insist, but there is something\neven more odd about saying that the entirety of person partakes of\nmotion without their mind partaking of motion as well. She might grant\nthat perhaps there are immaterial minds \u2013 and also numbers and\ngeometrical figures, etc. \u2013 that exist in a non-spatial Platonic\nrealm, but she would insist that these are not what we are referencing\nwhen we speak of the minds by which we deliberate on earth and have\nideas. The latter minds travel with us when we move and are material.\nCavendish is in effect imploring us to take seriously that the\nlanguage of moving minds is only unusual against the background of an\nimpoverished conception of matter.\n\nAnother argument that Cavendish puts forward for the view that\nthinking is material is from mind-body interaction. First, she\npresupposes a standard materialist premise: that nothing can interact\nwith or come into contact with a body but a body. She writes,\n\n\nIn fine, I cannot conceive, how a Spirit \u2026 can have the effects\nof a body, being none it self; for the effects flow from the cause;\nand as the cause is, so are its effects\u2026. (Cavendish 1664,\n197)\n\nit is, in my opinion, more probable, that one material should act upon\nanother material, or one immaterial should act upon another\nimmaterial, then that an immaterial should act upon a material or\ncorporeal. (Cavendish 1664, 207)\n\n\nThis is a standard kind of argument that we find in philosophers\nranging from Lucretius to Gassendi to Spinoza to Searle: that things\ncannot stand in causal relations with bodies unless they are material\n themselves.[15]\n Our minds interact with our bodies on a regular basis, but the\ninteraction of immaterials and materials is impossible, and so minds\nmust be material also.\n\nWe might worry that Cavendish has only provided reason to think that\nthe minds with which our bodies interact are material. Perhaps human\nbeings have bodies and material minds, and in addition we have an\nimmaterial mind (or soul) that is something above and beyond our\nmaterial mind. In a way she actually concedes the point:\n\n\nthere may be supernatural spiritual beings or substances in Nature,\nwithout any hinderance to Matter or corporeal Nature. The same I may\nsay of the natural material, and the divine and supernatural Soul; for\nthough the divine Soul is in a natural body, and both their powers and\nactions be different, yet they cause no ruine or disturbance to each\n other\u2026.[16]\n\n\nHere Cavendish is allowing that for all we know there exist immaterial\nentities like a divine and supernatural soul, but if so, we do not\ndetect any such entities, and they are not the things that we are\nreferencing when we talk about the minds by which we think and have\nideas. Those interact with bodies, and partake of motion, and\nhence they are material. If there is a divine and supernatural soul,\nour material minds (and bodies) cannot interact with it, and we cannot\ndetect it. Cavendish writes,\n\n\nWherefore no part of nature (her parts being corporeal) can perceive\nan immaterial; because it is impossible to have a perception of that\nwhich is not perceptible, as not being an object fit or proper for\ncorporeal\n perception.[17]\n\n[N]atural reason cannot know nor have naturally any perception or idea\nof an Incorporeal being. (Cavendish 1668a, 78)\n\nBut as for Immaterial, no mind can conceive that, for it cannot put it\nself into nothing, although it can dilate and rarifie it self to an\nhigher degree, but must stay within the circle of natural\n bodies\u2026.[18]\n\n\nThere might exist immaterial souls, Cavendish seems to be\nallowing in these passages, but if immaterial souls do exist we cannot\nperceive or form ideas of them. Furthermore, the entities that we\ndo conceive and discuss are not those immaterials but\nsomething else.\n\nSometimes Cavendish comes close to saying something even stronger:\nthat finite immaterial things have no being or reality at all. For\nexample, she writes,\n\n[Immaterial things are] Non-beings, for they are the weakest of all,\nand can do her [Nature] the least hurt, as not being able to obstruct\nreal and corporeal actions of Nature\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 242)\n\n\nHere she is agreeing with her contemporary Thomas Hobbes, who argued\nthat spirits exist but that the only existents are things that inhabit\nspace and have dimension, and so spirits are material. He holds\nthat\n\nThe World, (I mean no the Earth onely, that denominates the Lovers of\nit Worldly men, but the Universe, that is, the whole\nmasse of all things that are) is Corporeall, that is to say, Body; and\nhath the dimensions of Magnitude, namely, Length, Breadth, and Depth:\nalso every part of Body, is likewise Body, and hath the like\ndimensions; and consequently every part of the Universe, is Body; and\nthat which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: And because the\nUniverse is All, that which is no part of it, is Nothing; and\nconsequently no where. Nor does it follow from hence, that\nSpirits are nothing: for they have dimensions, and are therefore\nreally Bodies\u2026. (Hobbes 1651, xlvi.15, 463)\n\n\nHere Hobbes is suggesting that even God is a body, if God in fact has\nany reality, but Cavendish will not go quite that far. In one passage\nshe says that God is an immaterial, and is the only immaterial:\n\nan Immaterial, in my opinion, must be some uncreated Being; which can\nbe no other than GOD alone. Wherefore, created Spirits, and Spiritual\nSouls, are some other thing than an Immaterial; for surely, if there\nwere any other Immaterial Beings, besides the Omnipotent God, these\nwould be so near the Divine Essence of God, as to be petty gods,\nwould, almost, make the power of an Infinite God. But God is\nOmnipotent, and only God. (Cavendish 1668b, 239)\n\n\nIn the preponderance of passages Cavendish says that there are no\nnatural finite immaterials, and so she appears to allow that\nnon-natural finite immaterials might have some being or other. She\nsubsccribes to the view that only material things are real and\n substantial,[19]\n but perhaps she just holds that our word \u2018real\u2019 picks out\nthings that are tangible and spatial, even if there are other\nexistents as well. Cavendish suggests as much when she says that we\nmight be surrounded by immaterials, but that we cannot detect them.\nShe also writes,\n\n\nall that is called Immaterial, is a Natural Nothing, and an Immaterial\nNatural Substance, in my opinion, is non-sense\u2026. (Cavendish\n1664, 321)\n\n\nCavendish is committed to saying that the ideas and minds that we\nencounter are a part of nature and are material. Presumably she is\nright to hold that there might exist other things as well, even if\nthey are nothing to us.\n\nA problem that arises however is that as we have seen Cavendish holds\nthat we cannot form ideas of immaterials. If so, it is not clear how\n(on her view) we can have the thought that immaterials might exist.\nCavendish suggests very strongly that we can think and speak of\nimmaterials in her remark that they might in fact surround us; she\nsays that even if they did, we would be none the wiser. But still the\nquestion remains about how Cavendish can allow that we are able to\nthink or talk about immaterials at all, if we are not able to\nperceive, detect or have ideas of them.\n\nThere are a number of ways that Cavendish might maneuver here. One\nwould be to defend the thesis that although our natural (and hence\nmaterial) minds can form no conception of an immaterial, there is\nanother aspect of our minds \u2014 an aspect that is not material\n\u2014 and it can form conceptions of immaterials. Cavendish\nhints at this thesis when she states that natural reason cannot\nhave an idea of an incorporeal being, leaving open that non-natural\nreason could have an idea of an incorporeal being. A problem of course\nis that Cavendish does not seem to be able to allow that natural\nreason can have an idea of non-natural reason or that it can put\nforward the thesis that non-natural reason can form conceptions of\nimmaterials.\n\nAnother maneuver would be to make a distinction between knowledge and\nfaith and argue that although our minds cannot detect immaterials or\nhave any evidence for their existence, there must be some way in which\nour minds are able to conceive of immaterials (such as God), or else\nwe would not even be capable of faith. Cavendish writes for example\nthat\n\n\nthe rational [component of the mind] perceives some effects of the\nomnipotent power of God; which effects are perceptible by finite\ncreatures, but not his infinite nature, nor essence, nor the cause of\nhis infiniteness and omnipotency. (Ibid., 90)\n\n\nA problem of course is that if Cavendish is committed to the view that\nnatural reason can form no conception of an immaterial, then she can\nallow that we have ideas of things that are the effect of an\nimmaterial cause, but it is difficult to see how we could have an idea\nof that immaterial cause itself. So long as she \u201ctake[s]\nan idea to be the picture of some object\u201d (Cavendish 1668,\n74) and so long as immaterials cannot be captured in a figure or\nimage, it would appear that she is committed to saying that we can\nhave no ideas of immaterials at all.\n\nA third maneuver that Cavendish could make is to say that when she\ntalks in the language of immaterials, she is using terms that she does\nnot take to be referential, but that are still serving an important\ncommunicative role. For example, when she speaks of the immaterial\nsouls that might surround us, and the way in which they would be\nnothing to us, she might be trying to make a point in the language of\nher opponents. They speak in terms of immaterials, and\nCavendish might want to attempt to engage them. She says for example\nat the start of Philosophical Letters,\n\nI shall meerly go upon the bare Ground of Natural Philosophy,\nand not mix Divinity with it, as many Philosophers use to do, except\nit be in those places, where I am forced by the Authors Arguments to\nreflect upon it, which shall yet be rather with an expression of my\nignorance, then a positive declaration of my opinion of judgment\nthereof; for I think it not onely an absurdity, but an injury to the\nholy Profession of Divinity to draw her to the Proofs in Natural\nPhilosophy; wherefore I shall strictly follow the Guidance of\nNatural Reason, and keep to my own ground and Principles as\nmuch as I can\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 3)\n\n\nA potential problem for the view that Cavendish is making this third\nmaneuver in all cases in which she uses the word \u201cGod\u201d is\nthat there are texts outside of Philosophical Letters in\nwhich she uses the word but is not directly responding to the view of\na theistic opponent. But she is also clear in numerous passages that\nwe have no idea of God or any other immaterials, and no idea of\ninfinitude, and so it is likely that in those texts she is responding\nto a presumptive opponent, or perhaps just that she is being careful\nto articulate her piety.\n\nA final argument that Cavendish offers for the view that matter thinks\nand is intelligent is from the orderly behavior of bodies. One of the\nlongstanding puzzles of seventeenth-century philosophy and science was\nhow to explain this behavior. Cudworth lays out the puzzle very\nneatly. First, he offers a trilemma:\n\nsince neither all things are produced Fortuitously, or by the Unguided\nMechanism of Matter, nor God himself may reasonably be thought to do\nall things Immediately and Miraculously; it may well be concluded,\nthat there is a Plastick Nature under him, which as an\nInferior and Subordinate Instrument, doth Drudgingly Execute that Part\nof his Providence, which consists in the Regular and Orderly Motion of\nMatter. (Cudworth 1678, 150)\n\n\nCudworth settles on the third horn of the trilemma after ruling out\nthe other two. Bodies are dumb and dead, and so are not the source of\ntheir own order, and it would be beneath God to attend to bodily\naffairs Himself (Cunning 2003, 348\u201350). Cudworth also considers\na fourth option\u2014that the orderly behavior of bodies is secured\nby the existence of laws of\n nature.[20]\n He concludes that it is not an additional option after all but is\nsubsumed by the other three:\n\nThese men (I say) seem not very well to understand themselves in this.\nForasmuch as they must of necessity, either suppose these their\nLaws of Motion to execute themselves, or else be\nforced perpetually to concern the Deity in the Immediate Motion of\nevery Atom of Matter throughout the Universe, in Order to the\nExecution and Observation of them\u2026 we cannot make any other\nConclusion than this, That they do but unskillfully and unawares\nestablish that very Thing which in words they oppose; and that their\nLaws of Nature concerning Motion, are\nReally nothing else, but a Plastick Nature\u2026 (Cudworth\n1678, 151)\n\n\nHere Cudworth is pointing out, and Cavendish will agree, that we do\nnot account for the orderly behavior of bodies by positing laws of\nnature if we do not know what a law of nature is or how it operates.\nOn Cudworth\u2019s view, the orderly behavior of bodies is secured by\nimmaterial minds (or plastic natures) that attach to bodies and work\nto keep them on the rails. In something like the way that our\n(immaterial) minds intelligently guide our bodies, plastic natures\nintelligently guide the bodies that compose the plant and animal and\nmineral world. Cavendish agrees with a [highly modified] version of\nthis last statement. She will raise the objection, though, that minds\nthat move and come into contact with and attach to bodies must be\nmaterial themselves.\n\nLike Cudworth, Cavendish generates her view on the orderly behavior of\nbodies from a rejection of the Epicurean doctrine that the order that\nwe encounter in nature arises by chance. She writes,\n\n[T]hough the Opinion of Atoms is as Old as from the Time of Epicurus,\nyet my Conceptions of their Figures, Creating and Disposing, are New,\nand my Own. \u2026 It is not probable that the Substance of Infinite\nmatter is only Infinite, Small, Senseless Fibres, Moving and Composing\nall Creatures by Chance, and that Chance should produce all things in\nsuch order and Method, unless every Single Atome were Animated Matter,\nhaving Animated Motion, which is Sense and Reason, Life and\n Knowledge.[21]\n\n\nSomething is keeping bodies in line, according to Cavendish, and to do\nits job it must be active and knowledgeable and perceptive. It cannot\nbe immaterial, however, and so\n\nIf nature were not Self-knowing, Self-living, and also Perceptive, she\nwould run into Confusion: for there could be neither Order, nor\nMethod, in Ignorant\n motion\u2026.[22]\n\n\nCavendish rejects the view that matter is not capable of engaging in\norderly behavior on its own. It does not require the assistance of a\nplastic nature, for example, and it is not clear how such a thing\ncould be of any help anyway. Cavendish is indeed shocked at the\ntemerity of those who think that we can speak intelligibly of an\nimmaterial divine being but then allow that some of its creatures\nwould be dead and barren. She writes,\n\nI cannot imagine why God should make an Immaterial Spirit to be the\nProxy or Vice-gerent of his Power, or the Quarter-master General of\nhis Divine Providence, as your Author is pleased to style it, when he\nis able to effect it without any Under-Officers, and in a more easie\nand compendious way, as to impart immediately such self-moving power\nto Natural Matter, which man attributes to an Incorporeal Spirit.\n(Cavendish 1664, 215)\n\n\nCavendish does not appear to allow that we can speak intelligibly of\nGod (or other immaterials), and so here she is presumably just\ngranting some theistic assumptions for the sake of argument. She is\nsaying that if Cudworth and others are correct that God is an\nimpressive creator, He would not have created lousy bodies along with\nhigh-grade minds to keep them on the rails; he would have made\nhigh-grade bodies that are able to exhibit order on their\n own.[23]\n They would be knowledgeable of the order that they are supposed to\nrealize, and they would know the details of the bodies in their\n vicinity.[24]\n",
