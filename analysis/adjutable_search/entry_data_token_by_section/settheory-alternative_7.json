    "main_text": "Zermelo Set Theory and Its Refinements || Zermelo set theory\n4.1 Zermelo set theory\n\nThe original theory Z of Zermelo (1908) had the following\naxioms:\n\n\nExtensionality: Sets with the same elements are\nequal. (The original version appears to permit non-sets (atoms) which\nall have no elements, much as in my discussion above under naive set\ntheory).\n\nPairing: For any objects \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), there is a\nset \\(\\{a, b\\} = \\{x \\mid x = a \\lor x = b\\}\\). (the original axiom\nalso provided the empty set and singleton sets).\n\nUnion: For any set \\(A\\), there is a set \\(\\cup A =\n\\{x \\mid \\exists y(x \\in y \\amp y \\in A)\\}\\). The union of \\(A\\)\ncontains all the elements of elements of \\(A\\).\n\nPower Set: For any set \\(A\\), there is a set \\(\\wp(A)\n= \\{x \\mid \\forall y(y \\in x \\rightarrow y \\in A)\\}\\). The power set\nof \\(A\\) is the set of all subsets of \\(A\\).\n\nInfinity: There is an infinite set. Zermelo\u2019s\noriginal formulation asserted the existence of a set containing\n\\(\\varnothing\\) and closed under the singleton operation:\n\\(\\{\\varnothing ,\\{\\varnothing \\},\\{\\{\\varnothing \\}\\}, \\ldots \\}\\).\nIt is now more usual to assert the existence of a set which contains\n\\(\\varnothing\\) and is closed under the von Neumann successor\noperation \\(x \\mapsto x \\cup \\{x\\}\\). (Neither of these axioms implies\nthe other in the presence of the other axioms, though they yield\ntheories with the same mathematical strength).\n\nSeparation: For any property \\(P(x)\\) of objects and\nany set \\(A\\), there is a set \\(\\{x \\in A \\mid P(x)\\}\\) which contains\nall the elements of \\(A\\) with the property \\(P\\).\n\nChoice: For every set \\(C\\) of pairwise disjoint\nnonempty sets, there is a set whose intersection with each element of\n\\(C\\) has exactly one element.\n\n\nWe note that we do not need an axiom asserting the existence of\n\\(\\varnothing\\) (which is frequently included in axiom lists as it was\nin Zermelo\u2019s original axiom set): the existence of any object\n(guaranteed by logic unless we use a free logic) along with separation\nwill do the trick, and even if we use a free logic the set provided by\nInfinity will serve (the axiom of Infinity can be reframed to say that\nthere is a set which contains all sets with no elements (without\npresupposing that there are any) and is closed under the desired\nsuccessor operation).\n\nEvery axiom of Zermelo set theory except Choice is an axiom of naive\nset theory. Zermelo chose enough axioms so that the mathematical\napplications of set theory could be carried out and restricted the\naxioms sufficiently that the paradoxes could not apparently be\nderived.\n\nThe most general comprehension axiom of Z is the axiom of\nSeparation. If we try to replicate the Russell paradox by constructing\nthe set \\(R' = \\{x \\in A \\mid x \\not\\in x\\}\\), we discover that \\(R'\n\\in R' \\leftrightarrow R' \\in A \\amp R' \\not\\in R'\\), from which we\ndeduce \\(R' \\not\\in A\\). For any set \\(A\\), we can construct a set\nwhich does not belong to it. Another way to put this is that\nZ proves that there is no universal set: if we had the\nuniversal set \\(V\\), we would have naive comprehension, because we\ncould define \\(\\{x \\mid P(x)\\}\\) as \\(\\{x \\in V \\mid P(x)\\}\\) for any\nproperty \\(P(x)\\), including the fatal \\(x \\not\\in x\\).\n\nIn order to apply the axiom of separation, we need to have some sets\n\\(A\\) from which to carve out subsets using properties. The other\naxioms allow the construction of a lot of sets (all sets needed for\nclassical mathematics outside of set theory, though not all of the\nsets that even Cantor had constructed with apparent safety).\n\nThe elimination of the universal set seems to arouse resistance in\nsome quarters (many of the alternative set theories recover it, and\nthe theories with sets and classes recover at least a universe of all\nsets). On the other hand, the elimination of the universal set seems\nto go along with Cantor\u2019s idea that the problem with the\nparadoxes was that they involved Absolutely Infinite\ncollections\u2014purported \u201csets\u201d that are too large.\n",
