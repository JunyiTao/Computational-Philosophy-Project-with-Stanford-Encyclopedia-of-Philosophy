    "main_text": "Macaulay and America\n4. Macaulay and America\n\nApplying the principle that rights, if they exist at all, are\nuniversal, it is not surprising that Macaulay attempted to get her\nfellow country-men to see that injustice of taxing the colonies, while\nthey were not given any representation in the British Parliament. In\nher Address to the people of England, Scotland and Ireland on the\npresent important crisis of affairs, she called on the British\npeople to support the rights of the Americans, and to join with them\nin order to protect themselves from the encroachment of their own\nliberties. She held out to Britons what a loss it would be if, as a\nresult of a war of Independence they were to be deprived of all the\ncommercial advantages that flowed from the Empire, and were left\npossessing only their own \u201cfoggy islands\u201d (Macaulay 1775,\n27). But her fundamental appeal is not to the self-interest of her\ncountry-men, who she suspects may think that their own burden of\ntaxation is lightened by that placed on the Americans, but to the\nprinciple that it is only by supporting the rights of others that one\ncan in the long run support one\u2019s own rights. For her pains she was\nrepresented in the Westminster Magazine as a dagger-wielding\nhybrid of Roman matron and Indian chief, about to plunge her weapon\ninto Britannia\u2019s breast (Davies 2005, 152).\n\nDuring this period she corresponded with John and Abigail Adams, James\nOtis and Mercy Otis Warren, Benjamin Franklin and Sarah Prince-Gill,\namong numerous other colonists (Davies 2005, 127\u20139; Letzring\n1976; Macaulay 2019). In the second edition of her Loose Remarks she printed\nan exchange of letters with Benjamin Rush, in which he praised her\npolitical principles as well as offering some minor criticisms.\nMacaulay concludes her response to him by promoting to the Americans\n\u201cthe general principles of the rights of mankind inculcated in\nmy great work\u201d (Macaulay 1769, 35). Indeed, it is clear that the\nfirst five volumes of her eight volume history very clearly spell out\nthe principles that justified the War of Independence, and she was\nfeted when she travelled through nine of the thirteen states with her\nsecond husband. Despite her support for the Americans, as the actual\nConstitution was developed, she was not convinced that it would not be\ncorrupted, and in a correspondence with Mary Otis Warren the two women\nexpressed, with some prescience, their concerns that the arrangements\ndid not sufficiently protect against tendencies which would allow\naristocratic wealth, and the consequent corruption of the principles\nof liberty, to re-emerge (Hay 1994, 314).\n",
