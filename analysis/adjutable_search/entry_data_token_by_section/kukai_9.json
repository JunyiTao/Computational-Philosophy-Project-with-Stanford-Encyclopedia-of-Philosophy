Mantras denote the reality of all\ndharmas (shoh\u014d) \u2013 the elemental\nconstituents of reality \u2013 as themselves signifying the Dharma\npreached by the hosshin. (In Buddhism, the term\ndharma (h\u014d) has many meanings, among which are\nthe significances of truth itself and the elemental constituents of\nreality. When speaking of truth in its absolute sense as preached by\nDainichi or as embodied in the dharmak\u0101ya\n(hosshin), I have been capitalizing Dharma, and when\nspeaking of the elements that constitute reality, I leave\ndharma uncapitalized.) It represents the primordial speech of\nthe Buddha Dainichi uttering and expositing the Dharma, taken in both\nits restricted human significance and its broader cosmic significance.\nThat is, Dainichi\u2019s sermon as a mantra in the broad sense means\nall phenomena in general as vibrations emanating from\nDainichi\u2019s eternal samadhi through the interplay of the\nelements via the three media of body, speech, and mind.\nAll objects of the six senses as based upon those three media\nof visible and tangible forms, audible sounds, and thoughts, embody\nmantras as syllables uttered by Dainichi. And in its narrower sense\nthe mantra takes the abbreviated verbal form of syllables written in\nthe esoteric s\u016btras and uttered in esoteric ritual practice by\nthe practitioner. That is, the mantras uttered by practitioners in\nritual practice are to be taken as focused condensations of those\ncosmic vibrations in a particular sound. They are condensed\nmanifestations of the content of Dainichi\u2019s sermon, namely the\ntruth of enlightenment, the Dharma.\n3.7.1 Sh\u014djijiss\u014d: sound, sign, reality\n\nIn the broader sense of mantra, the whole cosmos is a language or text\nthat must be \u201cread\u201d if one is to receive its meaning (the\nDharma). K\u016bkai expresses this in the term\nsh\u014djijiss\u014d. Sh\u014dji means\n\u201csound-and-sign.\u201d Sh\u014d (or:\ns\u014d), meaning \u201csound,\u201d is the breath of\nDainichi, the vibrations of the five material elements in their\nmutually non-obstructively colliding interplay that resonate sounds\nthrough the air. In the narrower sense, this would be the mantras\nvoiced in ritual. Ji, meaning \u201csign,\u201d\n\u201cword,\u201d \u201cletter,\u201d or\n\u201ccharacter/graph,\u201d is sound in its signifying character as\nnaming or meaning something. As letter, it also provides a\nmaterial base whereby the sign\u2019s distinction from other signs\nbecomes retained and fixed. For what makes something a sign signifying\na specific meaning rather than another is difference\n(shabetsu). Anything that manifests its distinction from\nothers in virtue of its pattern (mon) \u2013 the various\ncombinations of shape, color, and movement among visual objects\n\u2013 then, for K\u016bkai, is a sign or letter (ji).\nMarking distinct patterns (mon), such things are\n\u201ccharacters\u201d (monji;\n\u201cpattern-letter\u201d). In the broadest and cosmic sense then,\nall phenomena of the six senses (i.e., the five physical senses plus\nthe thinking mind) as constituted by the inter-vibrations of the five\nmaterial elements and via their mutual distinctions\n(shabetsu), serve as letters of the cosmic (con)text,\nultimately signifying the Dharma but in its different aspects. In its\nnarrower significance, however, ji would be the written\nSanskrit letters as saturated with that esoteric meaning of the\nDharma. Jiss\u014d, meaning \u201creality,\u201d is that\nwhich is named, intended, meant, as evoked by sho becoming\nji. The ultimate referent or meaning of the world as text is\nthe Dharma in the spontaneous playing of its embodiment, the\nhosshin. In turn the process of articulation of the Dharma by\nthe hosshin generates everything in the cosmos, including the\nmyriad beings, their various realms, and its various forms of\nembodiment such as the celestial buddhas and the historical human\nbuddha. It also generates human languages in general which are thus\nseen as manifestations of this cosmic articulation. The cosmos as such\nis a text articulating the Dharma within the empty space of the vast\nlimitless and formless body of the hosshin. The cosmos as\nmantra is hence hosshin sepp\u014d.\n\nFrom the mantric articulation of the Dharma emerge ten realms and\ntheir respective languages (of hell dwellers, hungry ghosts, animals,\nasuras, humans, celestial heaven dwellers,\n\u015br\u0101vakas, pratyeka-buddhas,\nbodhisattvas, and buddhas). Each realm as an articulation of\nthe Dharma, has its own \u201csounds-and-signs,\u201d i.e., its own\nlanguage, in accordance with a specific perspective corresponding to\nthe degree of enlightenment and illusion of its inhabitants. But only\nthe language of the highest, the most comprehensive realm, i.e., the\nrealm of the Buddha, is identified with the \u201ctrue word\u201d\n(shingon, mantra), designating the Dharma as it is.\nThe nine other languages are by contrast \u201cillusory words\u201d\n(m\u014dgo). And yet they nevertheless do express the Dharma,\neach from its own relative and limited perspective. In this restricted\nsense, they are all mantras as well. For they take part in the cosmic\ntext of the hosshin written in the same inter-referential\ninterrelationships obtaining in all thing-events via the\ninterplay of the same universal elements. The difference is that while\nthe other languages are not conscious of their source, the most\ncomprehensive language, the \u201csounds-and-signs\u201d of the\nBuddha-realm, entails self-awareness of its mysterious origin.\n3.7.2. The cosmic text of the Dainichi-ky\u014d\n\nThe text of the Dainichi-ky\u014d itself is taken by\nK\u016bkai to be a condensation in scriptural form of that cosmic text\nof the mantra, comprising of the most comprehensive language of the\nBuddha-realm. And that same mantric text is then further condensed\ninto each syllabic-root letter of the Sanskrit alphabet itself, which\nthus serves as a means for meditation. In K\u016bkai\u2019s scheme\n(set out in his Dainichiky\u014d kaidai), the true\noriginal text of the Dainichi-ky\u014d is the eternal Dharma\nitself as the cosmic (con)text or mantra and cosmic mandala, existing\npermanently and comprising the universe and all phenomena. Within the\nworld, an abridged translation appeared that supposedly consisted of\n20,000 volumes and was circulated in India but became lost. The\nversion K\u016bkai brought back from China is a much smaller one, but\nhis claim is that every word, character, stroke or dot, within it in\nits mantric nature encompasses countless meanings and truths. Thus\nwhile the most abbreviated text is implaced within the original cosmic\ntext, the entire content of the cosmic text is itself encapsulated\nwithin the characters of its abridgment representing a condensation.\nThis \u201cinter-textuality\u201d exemplifies the Hua-yen (Huayan;\nJpn: Kegon) sense of interpenetration whereby the entire whole is\ncontained within each part, but here this Hua-yen idea is translated\nin mantric terms. This same scheme used in explaining the\nDainichi-ky\u014d was used by K\u016bkai to explain the\nrelationship of the Kong\u014dch\u014dgy\u014d and other\nesoteric texts to the world as well.\n3.7.3 Non-origination (honpush\u014d), emptiness (k\u016b), and difference (shabetsu)\n\nWhat exactly is the Dharma, the truth that all languages and all texts\npoint to as their mysterious source? K\u016bkai explicates its\nsignificance qua emptiness in terms of \u201cprimal\nnon-origination\u201d (Skrt: \u0101dyanutp\u0101da; Jpn:\nhonpush\u014d). What K\u016bkai means by\n\u201cnon-origination\u201d is related to his understanding of the\nemptiness of things and the differential referentiality of signs. By\nincorporating the Mah\u0101y\u0101na thought of emptiness,\nK\u016bkai\u2019s linguistic ontology of the mantra proves to be\nsimultaneously a linguistic \u201can-ontology\u201d (or:\n\u201cmeontology\u201d) of sorts. Every phenomenon of the cosmos,\nbeing empty of substantiality, is what it is through its\ninterdependent origination (Skrt:\nprat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da; Jpn: engi). Likewise\neach signifying letter of the cosmic text is what it is not\nbecause of its own substantial identity but rather through its\ndifference from other signifying letters. Its identity is constituted\nnot on the basis of a self-same essence but rather in reference to,\nand difference from, others. Signification then for K\u016bkai is\nnothing but differentiation (shabetsu), which is another way\nof speaking of the non-substantiality, i.e., emptiness, of phenomena.\nEvery thing \u2013 rocks, mountains, ants, etc. \u2013 is what it is\nin mutual distinction with everything else. And this differentiation\noccurs via its implacement into a specific situation or\ncontext vis-\u00e0-vis other things in an endless chain of mutually\nreferring (and differing) correlative thing-events. In reference to\nothers and without substantial self-presence, each thing-event is\nhence empty. In this respect, every thing, as signifying letter, is an\nembodiment of emptiness. And as such a sign or letter manifesting\nemptiness and differential referentiality, each thing-event is thus a\nmantra, Dainichi\u2019s \u201cseal of wisdom of\ndifferentiation\u201d (shabetsu chiin). The cosmic text\nconstituted of mutually differing signs is then the empty place of\nempty things, and as such, the ultimate scripture of emptiness. The\nhosshin as the embodiment of this truth, the Dharma, is thus\nitself differentiation, emptiness.\n\nThe world emerges in the articulation of the Dharma through such\nmutual differentiations in pattern. From out of the sea of emptiness,\nthrough Dainich\u2019s articulation qua mutual interplay of\nthe five material elements, the cosmos is ordered into distinct and\ndiscrete things and events, and the hosshin transforms itself\ninto a legible \u2013 albeit ambiguous \u2013 cosmic (con)text. This\nlinguistic cosmogeny is simultaneously ontological and me-ontological.\nFor each thing as sign in differential reference to the rest of the\ncosmic text, mirrors the infinity of all the other mutually referring\nand mutually differing thing-events. In its own emptiness, each\nthing-letter mirrors the emptiness of the cosmos, i.e., the Dharma.\nThey are traces of the hosshin\u2019s omnipresencing\nnon-substantiality, emptiness as the \u201cprimal\nnon-originating\u201d source of these thing-events in their\nbeginningless and endless interrelations. K\u016bkai takes this\nlinguistic cosmo-genesis in emptiness via the\nhosshin\u2019s world-play, to be the meaning behind the\n\u201cplayful striding of great emptiness,\u201d mentioned in the\nDainichi-ky\u014d (T18:21a) and which he quotes in his\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi. Furthermore this cosmogeny that is an\narticulation of truth, the writing of the cosmic text, is open-ended\nand on-going, dynamically being continuously reworked. This accounts\nfor the ambiguity of the cosmic text and every sign within it.\n\nThe ambiguity of the mantric nature of the cosmos and of all\nthing-events is in the fact that they entail simultaneously both hope\nand difficulty for enlightenment. The language of the hosshin\nin the form of thing-events may either guide one to enlightenment or\ndeceive one into delusion. For in spite of their emptiness, their\ninterdependent origination, thing-events can be easily reified in\nlight of human desires. When this happens the cosmic text they\nconstitute is misread under the pretext that the world as such is\nnothing but a system of substantial things, and that any corresponding\nlanguage is nothing but a system of signs representing those\nsubstantial things. Through the reification of their being, their\n\u201cprimal non-originating\u201d emptiness is ignored. And\ncorrespondingly one becomes predisposed to cling to them and hence\nsuffer. But this lack of essential origins in each and every\nphenomenon, the absence of their first cause, simultaneously means\nthat we ourselves, all sentient beings, are endowed with the original\nenlightenment of the hosshin (hongaku hosshin).\nHence there is hope for the realization of this enlightenment\nfor all.\n3.7.4 Mantra intonation\n\nShingon ritual practice attempts to trigger this realization through\nthe mantric pronunciations of the five basic syllables of Sanskrit\n\u2013 A,Va, Ra, Ha,\nKha, (and sometimes adding a sixth syllable\nH\u016b\u1e43) \u2013, emulating the primordial utterance\nof Dainichi. This is to attune the practitioner to the inter-resonance\nof the basic elements underlying all phenomena, so that he may hear\nthe \u201ctrue words\u201d being preached by Dainichi. The\nmantra\u2019s power is in its incomprehensibility to human\nunderstanding. Its significance cannot be explained analytically or\nunderstood conceptually; it is instead to be experienced in ritual.\nThrough ritualized experience, these intellectually incomprehensible\nsounds, in the self-deconstruction of any assumed or projected\nmeaningfulness, paradoxically evoke the emptiness they mean and the\nemptiness of their meaning, the emptiness of all in their mutual\nnon-obstruction and interdependence. Its incomprehension makes\nexplicit the materiality and dynamic process involved behind the\nemergence of signs. This undermines any linguistic assumption of the\nsubstantiality of things and hence any delusory attachments to them.\nWhat is invoked is a paradigm shift from seeing the surface pattern of\nthings to seeing their underlying emptiness. (Abe 1999, 297\u201398)\nIn addition to mantric intonations, another form of practice was\na-ji meditation, wherein the written form of the Sanskrit\nletter A is treated as an object of meditation. The purpose\nof such concentrated attention on the material form of a sign is to\ngain some sort of an experiential comprehension of its esoteric\nsignificance, somewhat similar to that of mantra incantation as just\ndiscussed. However we must note the special significance of the\nparticular letter A, which we shall discuss below.\n3.7.5 The mantric syllable of A\n\nThe two most important mantric syllables from Sanskrit\n\u2013 in the Siddham (Jpn: shittan) script system\npopularized in East Asia \u2013 emphasized in Shingon Buddhism, in\nboth sound and graph, are A and Un\n(H\u016b\u1e43). The former is the seed-syllable of Dainichi\nas explicated in the Dainichi-ky\u014d and the latter is the\nseed-syllable of the Kong\u014d-satta (Vajrasattva, a\nbuddha-being believed to have received instruction directly from\nMah\u0101vairocana) as explicated in the\nKong\u014dch\u014d-gy\u014d, and together seen as\nnon-dualistic in significance. In the following I will discuss the\nsignificance of these seed-syllables.\n\nK\u016bkai in several works (especially in\nSh\u014djijiss\u014dgi and Unjigi) explicates the\nsyllabic letter A as signifying the above-mentioned\n\u201cprimal non-originating\u201d character of all thing-events, as\nthe \u201cmother\u201d of all syllables, letters, and languages, and\nthe king of all mantras. The sound A is also the primal sound\nmade when the mouth first opens to exhale. And in its written form,\nA constitutes the first stroke of every other syllable.\nA is the first syllable of the Sanskrit alphabet as well as\nof the Sanskrit words for \u201corigin\u201d (\u0101di) and\n\u201cunborn\u201d (anutp\u0101da), combined in the\nSanskrit word \u201cprimal non-origination\u201d\n(\u0101dyanutp\u0101da). It is also the first letter of the\nroot mantra of Dainichi as depicted in the Taiz\u014d Mandara (which\nwe shall discuss below): A Vi Ra H\u016b\u1e43 Kham\n(Jpn: A Bira Un Ken). Furthermore in\nSanskrit, A is used as a negative prefix. All of these\nmanifold meanings are combined in Shingon\u2019s mantric use\nof A to represent the primal vocalization of Dainichi. Its\nomnipresence in form and sound symbolizes the Buddha-nature of the\nhosshin pervading everywhere, while condensing the\nsignificance of that all-prevalence within its singular form and\nsound. But its all-pervasiveness also means the origin of all things\nin their interdependence, that is, their interdependent origination,\nhence emptiness. This emptiness of substance is denoted by its use as\na negative prefix, i.e., the absence of self-presence in infinite\nreferentiality. As stated above, A signifies the\n\u201cprimal non-originating\u201d character of all being. For in\nsignifying the origin of all in their on-going dependent origination\nA is thus the \u201corigin of no origin.\u201d What this\npoints to is the endlessness of the chain of conditions behind each\nthing-event, never reaching an ultimate origin or first cause. But\nparadoxically this primal absence of any distinguishing origin, this\nubiquitous in-difference of all differentiation, is itself the\nultimate origin of all thing-events in their mutual differentiations\nand co-relativity. Or put differently, Dainichi\u2019s mind (along\nwith his body), making no discrimination between this and that, is\nlike a great space (\u201cemptiness\u201d; k\u016b) from\nout of which he transforms himself through self-differentiation into\nthe myriad thing-events and beings. This causeless cause is symbolized\nin the last letter in Sanskrit, the letter H, the first\nletter of the mantra H\u016b\u1e43 (Jpn: Un). Its\nmeaning thus coincides with the \u201cprimal non-origination\u201d\ndenoted by the first letter of the alphabet, A. The syllable\nA, together with H then embodies the meanings of\nemptiness, dependent origination, and primal non-origination, all\nexpressing the beginningless and endless dynamic non-substantiality of\nthe entire cosmos and all being, the empty space that is the body of\nthe hosshin, the Dharma of all dharmas.\n\nIt should be remembered however that while K\u016bkai thus links the\nhosshin\u2019s preaching to the mantric sound and\nletter of A, this same preaching, symbolized in A,\nin fact encompasses all movements of the cosmos, involving colors,\nshapes, silence, bodily movements, etc., not just the explicitly\nvocal. Dainichi preaches the Dharma via all phenomenal means\nthrough the three media, the \u201cthree mysteries,\u201d of body,\nspeech, and mind, omnipresencing himself through all objects of the\nsix senses (the five physical senses plus thought). The entire cosmos\nis hence the language of the Buddha, inseparable from the\nBuddha\u2019s body that is in fact the embodiment of the Dharma\n(i.e., hosshin, dharmak\u0101ya). We now turn to the\nmandalic aspect of the embodiment of the Dharma and of\nDainichi\u2019s preaching of the Dharma.\n",
