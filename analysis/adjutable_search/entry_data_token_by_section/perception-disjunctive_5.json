According to one\napproach what is fundamental to the nature of a veridical perception is\nthe fact that it belongs to an epistemically distinguished class of\nperceptual experiences. Those advocating this form of disjunctivism\nplace emphasis on the idea that when one veridically perceives the\nworld one has a distinctive form of epistemic contact with the\nmind-independent world, and one\u2019s experience provides one with\ngrounds for making knowledgeable perceptual judgements about the\nmind-independent world that would be lacking if one were merely\nhallucinating. On this view it is a mistake to assume that the\nepistemic grounds that a veridical perception can provide one with for\nmaking judgements about the world are no better than the epistemic\ngrounds that are available to one when one has a subjectively\nindistinguishible hallucination. Moreover, according to this view, the\nepistemic difference between a veridical perception and a subjectively\nindistinguishible hallucination is not to be explained by simply citing\nfactors that are external to the subjective experiential state one is\nin when one veridically perceives the world. Rather, the epistemic\ndifference is due to the fact that the kind of subjective experiential\nstate one is in when one veridically perceives the world is not the\nsame as the kind of subjective experiential state one is in when one\nhas a subjectively indistinguishible hallucination.\n\n\nByrne and Logue (2008) and Snowdon (2005a) argue that that this sort\nof epistemologically motivated view need not preclude the idea that it\nis possible to identify a perceptual state that is common to veridical\nperception and hallucination. The suggestion is that one can accept the\nclaim that there is an epistemically distinguished category of\nexperiential state that can only obtain when one veridically perceives\nthe world, and yet one can consistently maintain that it is also\npossible to identify a kind of perceptual state, of which some positive\naccount can be given, which can obtain whether one is veridically\nperceiving the world, or merely having a subjectively indistinguishible\nhallucination. One can therefore be an epistemological disjunctivist\nwithout accepting metaphysical disjunctivism. However, note that if one\nholds that the epistemological feature that is present in the case of\nveridical perception and lacking in the case of hallucination is\nfundamental to the kind of mental state it is, then this would make one\na fundamental kind disjunctivist (see section 2.1.1).\n\n\nJohn McDowell is an epistemological disjunctivist and some have\nsuggested that the view he espouses does not commit him to\nmetaphysical disjunctivism. (For discussion of this claim see Snowdon\n2005a, Byrne and Logue 2008, and Haddock and McPherson 2008b). Millar\n(2007 and 2008) explicitly endorses the claim that we should accept a\nform of epistemological disjunctivism about perceptual knowledge\nwithout being committed to metaphysical disjunctivism. (For more\ngeneral discussion of epistemological disjunctivism, see Pritchard\n2012, and see also the papers collected in Doyle, Milburn and\nPritchard 2019).\n",
