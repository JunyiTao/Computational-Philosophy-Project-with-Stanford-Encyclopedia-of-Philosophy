    "preamble": "\n\nWillard Van Orman Quine (1908\u20132000) worked in theoretical\nphilosophy and in logic. (In practical philosophy\u2014ethics and\npolitical philosophy\u2014his contributions are negligible.) He is\nperhaps best known for his arguments against Logical Empiricism (in\nparticular, against its use of the analytic-synthetic distinction).\nThis argument, however, should be seen as part of a comprehensive\nworld-view which makes no sharp distinction between philosophy and\nempirical science, and thus requires a wholesale reorientation of the\nsubject.\n\nIn what follows, a very brief section on Quine\u2019s life and\nphilosophical work will be followed by an overview, which will serve\nto orient the reader. We shall not comment in any detail on\nQuine\u2019s work in pure logic or set theory (for Quine\u2019s work\non set theory, see the entry on\n Quine\u2019s New Foundations),\n and also Morris 2018. The third section is devoted to Quine\u2019s\narguments against the use that the Logical Empiricists made of the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction, and the view that he worked out to\ntake its place. The subsequent three sections go systematically\nthrough Quine\u2019s own views; the final section is on Quine\u2019s\nplace in the history of philosophy.\n",

Quine\u2019s Naturalism and its Implications\n2.1 Introduction\n\nQuine\u2019s philosophical thought is remarkably consistent over the\ncourse of his long working life. There are developments, of course,\nbut outright changes of mind are relatively rare and mostly on\nrelatively minor points. We can, for the most part, treat him as\nhaving a single philosophical orientation, to which what he calls\n\u201cnaturalism\u201d is fundamental. This is not to say that his\nnaturalism is self-conscious and explicit from the start; it is,\nrather, something that he became clearer about over the years. (For\nthe development of Quine\u2019s naturalism, see Verhaegh, 2018; for\nthe very early Quine, see Sinclair 2022.)\n\nThe term \u201cnaturalism\u201d has been understood in various ways;\nwe need to see what Quine\u2019s naturalism comes to. At one point,\nhe describes naturalism as \u201cthe recognition that it is within\nscience itself, and not in some prior philosophy, that reality is to\nbe identified and described\u201d (1981, 21). Two points are\nimportant to note about the idea of \u201cscience\u201d here. First,\nit is less restrictive than it may seem. Quine certainly takes the\nnatural sciences, especially physics, as paradigmatic. As he says\nhimself, however, he uses the word \u201cscience\u201d broadly; he\nexplicitly includes psychology, economics, sociology, and history (see\n1995, 49). Second, Quine does not see scientific knowledge as\ndifferent in kind from our ordinary knowledge; he sees it, rather, as\nthe result of attempts to improve our ordinary knowledge of the world:\n\u201cScience is not a substitute for common sense but an extension\nof it.\u201d (1957, 229). The scientist, he says, \u201cis\nindistinguishable from the common man in his sense of evidence, except\nthat the scientist is more careful.\u201d (1957, 233). We might add\nthat the scientist is more narrowly focused on issues of truth and\nobjectivity and, in the hope of contributing to these goals, clearer\nand more systematic.\n\nMany philosophers would no doubt accept that the methods and\ntechniques of science are the best way to find out about the world.\n(With or without the points just noted about the word\n\u201cscience\u201d.) The distinctiveness of Quine\u2019s\nnaturalism begins to emerge if we ask what justifies this naturalistic\nclaim: what reason do we have to believe that the methods and\ntechniques of science are the best way to find out about the world?\nQuine would insist that this claim too must be based on natural\nscience. (If this is circular, he simply accepts the circularity.)\nThis is the revolutionary step: naturalism self-applied. There is no\nfoundation for Quine\u2019s naturalism: it is not based on anything\nelse.\n\nThe point here is that Quine denies that there is a distinctively\nphilosophical standpoint, which might, for example, allow\nphilosophical reflection to prescribe standards to science as a whole.\nHe holds that all of our attempts at knowledge are subject to those\nstandards of evidence and justification which are most explicitly\ndisplayed, and most successfully implemented, in the natural sciences.\nThis applies to philosophy as well as to other branches of knowledge.\nThe epistemologist, therefore, reflects on science from within\nscience; there is no theory of knowledge distinct from science.\n\u201cEpistemology\u201d, Quine says, \u201c\u2026is contained in\nnatural science, as a chapter of psychology\u201d (1969, 83). (For an\nalternative view of the relation of philosophy to science, based on\ndiscussion of the history of science, see Friedman, 1997.)\n\nIn Quine\u2019s view, philosophers can, therefore, do no better than\nto adopt the standpoint of the best available knowledge, i.e. science,\nin some suitably broad sense. We adopt what he calls \u201cthe\nfundamental conceptual scheme of science and common sense\u201d\n(1960, 276). Philosophers are thus to be constrained by scientific\nstandards. In (1974) he puts it this way: \u201cIn our account of how\nscience might be acquired we do not try to justify science by some\nprior and firmer philosophy, but neither are we to maintain less than\nscientific standards. Evidence must regularly be sought in external\nobjects, out where observers can jointly observe it\u2026.\u201d\n(1974, 34f.)\n2.2 Negative Aspects\n\nThe view sketched above has both positive and negative aspects. The\nlatter are better-known, and Quine is often thought of as a negative\nphilosopher, primarily concerned to criticize others. He casts doubt\non terms which many philosophers take for granted. He does not dismiss\nsuch terms as meaningless, but simply as not meriting a place in\nserious science, or in the objective account of the world at which\nscience aims. A well-known and important example is his criticism of\nthe idea of meaning, in the sense of the meaning of a particular\nsentence or statement. Quine says: \u201cMeaning\u2026 is a worthy\nobject of philosophical and scientific clarification and analysis,\nand\u2026 it is ill-suited for use as an instrument of philosophical\nand scientific clarification and analysis.\u201d (1981, 185). The\nterm is insufficiently clear, and putative explanations which employ\nit are in fact unexplanatory; by engendering the illusion of\nexplanation they tend to impede the progress of science. So\nphilosophers should not rely on the term. He makes similar remarks\nabout \u201cthought\u201d, \u201cbelief\u201d,\n\u201cexperience\u201d, \u201cnecessity\u201d, and other terms\nwhich many philosophers assume are legitimate and available for\nphilosophical use without themselves requiring explanation and\njustification in other terms. (For an illustration of Quine\u2019s\nattitude towards the term \u201cmeaning\u201d as used by one such\nphilosopher, see his reply to Pagin in Orenstein and Kokato,\n420f.)\n\nThis criticism of the scientific and philosophical use of certain\nordinary terms goes along with rejection of philosophical questions\nwhich make essential use of those terms. For example, many\nphilosophers hold that there are important philosophical problems\nconcerning knowledge: Do we really know anything at all? What exactly\nare the conditions on knowledge? (This latter question has seemed\nespecially pressing since Gettier, 1963.) Quine, by contrast, finds\nthe word \u201cknowledge\u201d vague, and consequently rejects it\nfor serious use, saying that the word is \u2018\u2018useful and\nunobjectionable in the vernacular where we acquiesce in vagueness, but\nunsuited to technical use because of lacking a precise\nboundary\u2019\u2019 (1984, 295). Accordingly, many such questions\nformulated using the term may simply be dismissed, even if it remains\neminently useful for making rough sorts of claim, when we say as above\nthat scientific knowledge is not different in kind from our ordinary\nknowledge.\n2.3 Positive Aspects (1): Knowledge\n\nAs we have just seen, Quine\u2019s views issue in very general\ncriticism of much philosophy and indeed of the assumption that the\nterm \u201cknowledge\u201d marks a clear subject of inquiry. It is,\nnevertheless, a mistake to think of him as primarily a critical or\nnegative thinker: his criticisms rely on his positive doctrine, which\nin turn generates further questions. As for whether those are\ngenuinely philosophical questions, it is implicit in what has\nalready been said that he would not acknowledge such a category as the\n\u2018genuinely philosophical\u2019 if that is meant to\nimply questions which are different in kind from those of science. But\ncertainly he accepts that some questions are sufficiently general,\nabstract, and remote from observation, that they may be classified as\nphilosophical. At times he assimilates the questions with which he is\nconcerned to those which have traditionally occupied philosophers.\nEpistemology\u2014the theory of knowledge\u2014is a clear example,\nalthough Quine\u2019s approach to that subject is quite different\nfrom that of many philosophers.\n\nIn some places, Quine approaches epistemology through the problem of\nscepticism about the external world. But he has no room for the kind\nof scepticism which asks the following kind of question: even if our\nalleged knowledge, our science, is completely successful in its\npredictions, how do we know that it tells us the way the world really\nis? (See Alston, 1993.) Thus Quine says:\n\nOur scientific theory can go wrong, and precisely in the familiar way:\nthrough failure of predicted observation. But what if\u2026 we have\nachieved a theory that is conformable to every possible observation,\npast and future? In what sense could the world then be said to deviate\nfrom what the theory claims? Clearly in none\u2026. (1981,\n22; emphasis added)\n\n\nThis dismissal of one kind of scepticism is an example of\nQuine\u2019s naturalism, and indicates how he understands that\nidea.\n\nThere is, however, a way of understanding the sceptical question which\nQuine takes seriously. Philosophers have been concerned with the gap\nbetween what is given in experience and the knowledge that we take\nourselves to have. Quine invokes gestalt psychology and argues that\nthe simple sensory ideas which Berkeley and Hume had claimed were\ngiven by the senses are not in fact given, that we see things in\nthree-dimensions, for example, instead of having to infer the third.\nHe does not, however, conclude that there is no problem at all here.\nRather, he says, \u201cthe problem was real but wrongly viewed\u201d\n(1974, 2). Epistemology, as he sees it, is here \u201cconfronting a\nchallenge to natural science that arises from within natural\nscience.\u201d (loc. cit.). What is the challenge? It starts\nwith what Quine takes to be \u201ca finding of natural science\nitself\u2026 that our information about the world comes only through\nimpacts on our sensory receptors\u201d (1990a, 19). The sceptical\nchallenge is then: \u201cHow\u2026 could one hope to find out about\nthat external world from such meager traces? In short, if our science\nwere true, how could we know it?\u201d (1974, 2).\n\nScepticism, understood in this fashion, is a challenge to\nQuine\u2019s form of naturalism. It questions whether our knowledge\ncan be accounted for in terms which are, by Quine\u2019s standards,\npurely naturalistic. Quine\u2019s response is thus to sketch an\nausterely naturalistic account of how our knowledge, and the cognitive\nlanguage in which that knowledge is embodied, arises, or might arise.\nThis project, as he sees it, is essential to the defence of his\nnaturalistic world-view. (Section 4. will go into more detail about\nthe project.)\n\nWhen Quine asks: \u201cHow\u2026 could one hope to find out about\nthat external world from such meager traces?\u201d this is not a\nrhetorical question. It is, rather, a serious question, to be answered\nby deploying the full resources of our knowledge; it is a scientific\nquestion. Quine recognizes that the question, thus construed, is not\nexactly what earlier epistemologists had in mind, but argues that the\nchange is justified: \u201cA far cry, this, from the old\nepistemology. Yet it is no gratuitous change of subject matter, but an\nenlightened persistence rather in the original epistemological\nproblem.\u201d (1974, 3).\n2.4 Positive Aspects (2): the Nature of the World\n\nThe defence and articulation of Quine\u2019s naturalism requires\nQuinean epistemology, an analogue of traditional epistemology but\ncarried out as a scientific enterprise. It also requires that he set\nout, in outline, what is to be included in a naturalistic account of\nthe world; in other words, it requires an account of the world, a\nleast in broad outline. Among other things, this account constrains\nhis epistemology, since that is to be a naturalistic account of\nknowledge.\n\nIn what follows, we shall sometimes speak of Quine\u2019s account of\nthe world as his \u201cmetaphysics\u201d, but it is metaphysics\nnaturalized: it is not carried out a priori, or by reflection\non the nature of Being qu\u00e2 Being, or anything of that\nsort. (Quine himself does not much use the word\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d. He puts forward views on metaphysical\ntopics\u2014such as ontology, time, and abstract objects\u2014but\nwithin the confines of his naturalism.)\n\nQuine approaches his naturalistic analogue of metaphysics through the\nidea of regimented theory. Regimented theory is our overall science,\nthe sum total of our best and most objective knowledge about the\nworld, reformulated in the clearest and simplest form. Quine sees this\nkind of reformulating as of a piece with ordinary scientific\nendeavours, but carried further than working scientists are likely to\nhave reason to do. He discusses the distorting effect which language\nis likely to have on our view of the world and comments:\n\nTo some degree\u2026the scientist can enhance objectivity and\ndiminish the interference of language, by his very choice of language.\nAnd we [meaning we philosophers, we scientists at the abstract and\nphilosophical end of the spectrum], concerned to distill the essence\nof scientific discourse, can profitably purify the language of science\nbeyond what might reasonably be urged upon the practicing scientist.\n(1957, 235)\n\n\nRegimented theory is, of course, an idealization. It is not a complete\nand finished object, available for us to examine. Quine\u2019s\nreflections on it might be considered as something like a\nthought-experiment: if we were to set about assembling our total\ntheory of the world and recasting it in the best form, what would it\nlook like? Since the enterprise is not in fact going to be carried out\nall the way we are not going to get a detailed answer. But on some\nimportant general issues, Quine holds, we can get answers. In\nparticular, he argues that the framework of regimented theory is\nfirst-order logic with identity (and so that theory is extensional);\nthat the variables of this theory range only over physical objects and\nsets; and that the predicates of the theory, the only non-logical\nvocabulary, are physicalistic, in his somewhat complicated sense. (See\nsection 5, below.) Although this is not traditional a priori\nmetaphysics, we should not underestimate the ambition of the project.\nHe says of his regimented theory that \u201call traits of reality\nworthy of the name can be set down in an idiom of this austere form if\nin any idiom\u201d (1960, 228) and speaks of \u201climning the true\nand ultimate structure of reality\u201d (1960, 221). The claim that\nthe variables of regimented theory range only over physical objects\nand sets is, as far as he is concerned, the claim that only physical\nobjects and sets really exist.\n3. The Analytic-Synthetic Distinction and the Argument Against Logical Empiricism\n\nThe philosophers who most influenced Quine were the Logical\nEmpiricists (also known as Logical Positivists), especially Rudolf\nCarnap. The distinction between analytic truths and synthetic truths\nplays a crucial role in their philosophy. Analytic truths might be\ncharacterized as those true solely in virtue of the meanings of the\nwords they contain, or of the rules of the language, or something of\nthe sort. Synthetic truths, by contrast, state matters of\nextra-linguistic fact, and are known by experience. The Logical\nEmpiricists accounted for truths which do not seem to be answerable to\nexperience, most obviously the truths of logic and mathematics, by\nsaying that they are analytic. This position was very widely held by\nthe 1940s. Quine, however, famously casts doubt on analytic-synthetic\ndistinction, and rejects the use made of it by the Logical Empiricists\nand other philosophers from the 1930s on. (Notable among the others is\nC. I. Lewis, first a teacher and then a colleague of Quine; his\ninfluence on Quine has perhaps been underestimated. See Baldwin 2013,\nBen-Menahem 2016, and Sinclair 2016.)\n\nThe issues here are complex, and the argument takes many twists and\nturns. The aim of this section is to give an account of Quine\u2019s\nmature view, and of the strongest arguments that he has for it.\n3.1 Carnap\u2019s Principle of Tolerance and Quine\u2019s Objections\n\nCarnap holds that the role of philosophy is to analyze and clarify the\nlanguage of science, and to formulate and recommend alternative\nlanguages. After 1932, he holds that there are languages which differ\nin expressive power, not merely as notational variants. The difference\nbetween intuitionistic logic and classical logic is an important\nexample here, as is the difference between the language of Newtonian\nmechanics and the language of relativistic mechanics. (Earlier, he\nsays, he had \u2018overlooked the fact that there is a multiplicity\nof possible languages\u2019, Carnap 1934, 245; cf. also 322 of the\nsame work.) Within a given language, there may be only one correct\ntheory on a given subject. But the choice of a language is in that\nrespect unlike the choice of a theory. In deciding which theory is\ncorrect, we will appeal to observations but also to the rules of the\nlanguage; no such appeal is possible when we are choosing a language,\nfor in this case it is the rules themselves that we are choosing. So\nCarnap holds that there is no one correct language. This idea\nhas become known as the Principle of Tolerance; from the 1930s on, it\nis fundamental to Carnap\u2019s view of what philosophy is and how it\ndiffers from science. (That there is such a difference is a point\nwhich Carnap never questions.) Because there is no one correct\nlanguage, it is no part of the philosopher\u2019s job to prescribe\nthis or that language, merely to analyze, to clarify, and to suggest\nalternatives.\n\nThe Principle of Tolerance requires the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. It requires that we can, in all cases, distinguish\nbetween theoretical changes which involve a change of meaning, and\nhence, strictly speaking, a change of language, and those which do\nnot. The former kind of change involves analytic sentences, and is a\nmatter for Tolerance; the latter involves only synthetic sentences,\nand Tolerance does not apply. The use of the Principle of Tolerance\nthus presupposes a clear distinction between the analytic sentences of\nthe language and its synthetic sentences.\n\nAt least as Quine sees the matter, the use of the Principle of\nTolerance puts analytic sentences on an entirely different\nepistemological footing from synthetic sentences. Synthetic sentences\nare answerable to evidence; analytic sentences are a matter of the\nchoice of language, which does not require theoretical justification.\nQuine, however, rejects the idea that there is such an epistemological\ndifference. Even if we can distinguish the analytic sentences from the\nsynthetic sentences, we may still have reasons to reject an analytic\nsentence. And those reasons may be of the same kind that lead us to\nreject synthetic sentences. This point is hard to see if one focuses\non examples such as \u201cAll bachelors are unmarried\u201d. The\nmatter is otherwise if one considers examples such as \u201cForce\nequals mass times acceleration\u201d. (See Putnam, 1962.) A change of\nmind about an analytic sentence would be a change in the language.\nStill, we might have reasons to make such a change, reasons that are\nof the same sort that lead us to make revisions to synthetic\nsentences. In that case, we have no more reason to apply Tolerance in\nthe one kind of case than in the other.\n\nThis is the view that Quine argues for. On the one hand, he emphasizes\nthe point (which Carnap largely accepts) that choice of language is\nnot theoretically neutral: some choices will make for a better theory\nthan others. On the other hand, he argues that \u2018pragmatic\u2019\nfactors, such as simplicity, which Carnap had accepted as playing a\nrole in choice of language, also play a role in the choice of a theory\nwithin a language. Hence, he claims, the two sorts of choice are on\nthe same epistemological footing, and the Principle of Tolerance is\nunjustified.\n\nQuine\u2019s argument for this position relies on holism.\nThis is the claim that most of our sentences do not have implications\nfor experience when they are taken one-by-one, each in isolation from\nthe others. What has experiential implication is, in most cases, not\nan individual sentence but a larger chunk of theory. Holism is not a\nvery controversial doctrine. (Carnap accepts it; see Carnap, 1934,\n318.) Quine claims that holism shows that most of our sentences are\nnot justified by the relation of the individual sentence, considered\nin isolation, to experience. Almost always, what matters is the\nrelation to experience of some larger chunk of theory (in principle,\nalthough perhaps never in practice, of the theory as a whole). This\nmeans that in principle the correctness of a given claim is almost\nnever settled simply by looking at the empirical evidence for that\nclaim alone. Other factors will play a role, in particular the way in\nwhich accepting the given claim would contribute to the efficacy and\nsimplicity of the theory as a whole. But these are precisely the\n\u2018pragmatic factors\u2019 which Carnap thought played a role in\nthe choice of language. In arguing that such factors play a role\nthroughout our knowledge, Quine accepts \u2018a more thorough\npragmatism\u2019 (1951, 46) which puts Carnap\u2019s external\nchanges on the same epistemological footing as his internal changes.\n(Quine\u2019s early account of these matters is extremely sketchy.\nFor elaboration, see Quine 1991 and 1996; for criticism of the sketchy\naccount, see Sober 2000.)\n3.2 Quine\u2019s Alternative\n\nIf logic, mathematics, and other putatively a priori parts of\nour knowledge, are not to be explained by analyticity, how are they to\nbe accounted for? Holism, which is central to Quine\u2019s argument\nagainst Carnap, also provides him with an alternative position. It\nseems as if logic and mathematics have a special status because they\nare independent of experience. They appear to be necessary and not\nsusceptible of refutation by what future experience brings; they\nappear to be a priori because we know them independent of\nexperience. Carnap sought to explain these appearances by appealing to\nthe idea that accepting an analytic sentence of a given language goes\nwith speaking that language, and to the Principle of Tolerance. Since\nchoice of language is not justified by experience, the truth of the\nanalytic sentences of a given language is not answerable to\nexperience.\n\nHow is Quine to explain the apparent necessity and a priori\nstatus of some truths without appeal to the Principle of Tolerance?\nQuine\u2019s holism is the view that almost none of our knowledge is\ndirectly answerable to experience. (The exceptions are what\nhe calls \u2018observation sentences\u2019; see 4.2, below.) In\nalmost all cases the relation is indirect: a given sentence is only\nanswerable to experience if a body of theory is presupposed. (When we\nsay that a given observation confirms or refutes a given theoretical\nclaim, we are tacitly presupposing other theoretical knowledge.) This\nis most easily seen if we consider a highly theoretical sentence, but\nin Quine\u2019s view it holds, of almost all our sentences. The\nreason to accept a sentence is its contribution to the success of\ntheory as a whole as an efficient and simple method of dealing with\nand predicting experience; in principle, this means the success of our\ntheory as a whole, the whole body of sentences that we accept, in\ndealing with experience as a whole.\n\nFor many of our sentences, this strong statement of holism holds only\nin principle. In practice, we may have a good idea what experiences\nwould lead us to change our minds about a given sentence, and what\nfurther changes in theory would follow. Elementary arithmetic (to take\nthat as an example) is different because it is involved in almost\nevery part of systematic knowledge. (In Quine\u2019s well-known\nmetaphor, it stands near the centre of the \u2018web of\nbelief\u2019.) Abandoning it would mean abandoning our whole system\nof knowledge, and replacing it with an alternative which we have not\neven begun to envisage. Nothing in principle rules out the possibility\nthat the course of experience will be such that our present system of\nknowledge becomes wholly useless, and that in constructing a new one\nwe find that arithmetic is of no use. But this is a purely abstract\npossibility, certainly not something we can imagine in any detail. So\nthe idea that we might reject arithmetic is likewise unimaginable;\nhence the truths of arithmetic appear to be necessary.\n\nFor similar reasons, arithmetic appears to be a priori. No\nparticular experience confirms \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019. (Quine is not\nadvancing what Frege derided as a \u2018gingerbread and pebble\u2019\naccount of arithmetic (Frege 1884, vii), in which the sentence is\njustified by our observations of cookies or stones.) Arithmetic is\nindependent of any particular experience, or any easily specifiable\nportion of experience; hence it appears as a priori. On\nQuine\u2019s account, it rests on our experience as a whole, and the\nfact that the theory which best accounts for that experience makes\nessential use of arithmetic.\n3.3 Meaning and Quinean Analyticity\n\nAs we have just seen, even sentences which we cannot imagine rejecting\nmight, in principle, be rejected. As Quine says: \u2018no statement\nis immune to revision\u2019 (1951, 43; see Ebbs 2017, Ch. 8). This\nclaim of Quine\u2019s has attracted a good deal of attention, and is\nsometimes thought to be shocking or even paradoxical. In the context\nof his debate with Carnap, however, it is not, by itself, at all\nsurprising. For Carnap too, any sentence can be revised; he would\ninsist, however, that in the case of some sentences, the analytic\nones, a revision involves a change of language, and thus of the\nmeaning of the words used in the sentence. So the idea of meaning, and\nsameness of meaning, occupies a crucial role in the debate over\nanalyticity.\n\nQuine\u2019s initial arguments against the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction seek to cast doubt on the idea that there is a notion of\nmeaning which is clear enough to use in defining a notion of\nanalyticity. He explores various proposals and finds them wanting.\n(See especially Quine 1951.) Here too a crucial role is played by\nholism. One apparently clear conception of meaning is that the meaning\nof a sentence is given by the experiences which would confirm it;\nholism, however, implies that the idea of confirmation does not apply\nto individual sentences, considered in isolation from the theories of\nwhich they are parts. (For criticism see Fodor and Lepore 1992; for a\ncounter to Fodor and Lepore see Heal 1994; for later Quine on holism\nsee his 1991.)\n\nQuine\u2019s scepticism about the idea of meaning is much criticized.\nWe will mention two criticisms. First, what standards of clarity is he\nemploying, when he says that the notion of analyticity is\ninsufficiently clear? The answer, not explicit in Quine (1951), is\nthat the standards are those indicated by our discussion in the\nprevious section; Quine is asking for an explanation which is\nacceptable by his naturalistic standards (see Lugg 2012). Such an\nexplanation would not presuppose an idea of meaning, and would use\nsuch ideas as definition or convention only in ways which are\njustified by the literal sense of those terms. Second, some responses\nto Quine\u2019s position here argue that it has obviously absurd\nconsequences, such as that meaningful discourse would be impossible or\nthat we could not understand our language. (See, for example, Grice\nand Strawson, 1956.) But Quine\u2019s scepticism about\nmeanings does not lead to any scepticism about\nmeaningfulness. If we think of meaningfulness as a matter of\nhaving a meaning then we may think that our words cannot be\nmeaningful unless there are meanings. But such a way of thinking is,\nQuine claims, quite misleading. In Quine 1953, he offers a rough and\nready behavioural account of meaningfulness; it is clear from the way\nthe account proceeds that the success of something along those lines\nwould be of no help at all in defining synonymy or analyticity.\n\nWe said above that Quine seeks \u2018to cast doubt\u2019 on the idea\nof meaning, and on the use of that idea to explain the distinction\nbetween those changes of doctrine which involve a change of meaning\nand those which do not, and thus also to explain analyticity. One\nmight read Quine 1951 and get the impression that he is not merely\ncasting doubt but wholly rejecting these ideas. In later works,\nhowever, he himself suggests a definition of analyticity. A sentence\nis analytic for a given native speaker \u2018if he learned the truth\nof the sentence by learning to use one or more of its words\u2019\n(Quine 1991, 270; see also Quine 1974, 78\u201380). It is analytic\nwithout qualification if it is analytic for all native speakers. By\nthis criterion, some obvious truths, such as \u2018Bachelors are\nunmarried\u2019, will presumably count as analytic. If we think of\nthe set of analytic sentences as closed under logical consequence, as\nQuine suggests, then, he says, all first-order logical truths\n\u2018would then perhaps qualify as analytic\u2019 (Quine 1991,\n270). Along with this, he comes to accept that certain revisions of\nbelief do involve a change of meaning, presumably in a sufficiently\nclear sense of meaning (Quine 1991, 270).\n\nNow it might seem as if Quine completely withdraws his earlier\ncriticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction and thus, presumably,\nof Logical Empiricism as a whole. But in fact this is not so. One\nconsideration here is the scope of Quinean analyticity. The idea will\nperhaps (as Quine says) include first-order logic, but it will not\ninclude mathematics; on this count alone, it is clear that it will not\ndo what Carnap requires of the idea of analyticity. An even more\nimportant consideration is that Quine\u2019s version of the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction is not an epistemological distinction.\nSome changes of doctrine involve changes of meaning, others do not. In\nQuine\u2019s view, however, this does not mean that the two sorts of\nchange must have different epistemological bases. To the contrary: as\nwe saw in 3.1, Quine rejects the Principle of Tolerance and, with it,\nthe idea that a change of language takes place on a different kind of\nepistemological basis from a change of theory within a language. His\nacceptance of a limited conception of analyticity does not change this\npicture. As he says: \u201cI recognize the notion of analyticity in\nits obvious and useful but epistemologically insignificant\napplications\u201d (1991, 271; emphasis added).\n\nOn the interpretation advanced here, Quine\u2019s rejection of the\nPrinciple of Tolerance is the deepest aspect of his disagreement with\nCarnap. Quine sees all our cognitive endeavours, whether they involve\nformulating a new language or making a small-scale theoretical change,\nas having the same very general aim of enabling us to deal with the\nworld better; all such endeavours have the same very general kind of\njustification, namely, as contributing to that end. In this picture,\nthere is no basis for Carnap\u2019s insistence that philosophy is in\nprinciple different from science. Philosophy, as Quine sees it, has no\nspecial vantage point, no special method, no special access to truth.\nHere we have the crucial idea of Quine\u2019s naturalism, discussed\nin the previous section.\n4. Quinean Epistemology\n4.1 The Epistemological Project\n\nAs we saw in section 2, Quine takes the fundamental epistemological\nproblem to be that of showing how we come to have knowledge of the\nworld. He seeks an account which is naturalistic in his austere sense,\nand thus starts with the idea that we know about the world only from\nimpacts of various forms of energy on our sensory nerves (see 2.3,\nabove). How do we get from such impacts to something recognizable as\nknowledge of the world? In the words of the title of Quine\u2019s\nlast monograph: how do we get from stimulus to science?\n\nThis question is central for Quine\u2019s scientific naturalism in\ngeneral. An answer would show that that world-view can accommodate an\naccount of human knowledge. If no answer is available, that world-view\nis cast in doubt. For these purposes it is perhaps enough if Quine can\nsketch an account, compatible with his naturalistic view, of how we\nmight acquire the knowledge which we take ourselves to have,\nwhether or not it is correct in detail. (See Quine 1990c, 291.)\n\nQuine treats knowledge as embodied in language. Apart from other\nconsiderations, language-use is observable and thus subject to\nscientific inquiry. Quine\u2019s concern with how we might acquire\nknowledge thus takes the form of a concern with how we might acquire\ncognitive language. But his interest here is in epistemology, rather\nthan in language for its own sake: \u201cI am interested in the flow\nof evidence from the triggering of the senses to the pronouncements of\nscience\u2026. It is these epistemological concerns, and not my\nincidental interest in linguistics, that motivate my\nspeculations.\u201d (1990b, 3).\n\nMuch of Quine\u2019s work in epistemology is thus a discussion of how\na child might acquire cognitive language. This genetic project may\nseem to be a long way from the traditional concerns of epistemology.\nQuine claims, however, that the project in fact affords us the best\nobtainable insight into the nature of the evidence for our theories,\nand into the relation between theory and evidence: \u201cthe\nevidential relation is virtually enacted, it would seem, in the\nlearning.\u201d (1975b, 74\u201375).\n4.2 Observation Sentences\n\nCentral to Quine\u2019s naturalistic account of knowledge is the idea\nthat all our knowledge is in some way based upon stimulations of our\nsensory nerves. For much of our knowledge, the relation is quite\nindirect. (This is one way of expressing holism; see 3.1, above.) Most\nsentences are not accepted because of a direct relation between the\ngiven sentence and stimulations of nerve endings; the connection goes\nvia other sentences, and may be quite indirect and remote. But then\nthere must presumably be some sentences which are directly related to\nstimulations. This is the role that observation sentences play in\nQuine\u2019s thought. Acts of uttering such sentences, or of\nassenting to them when they are uttered by others, are shared\nresponses to stimulation. (We shall enter some qualifications at the\nend of this sub-section.)\n\nObservation sentences are the starting point for our acquisition of\nknowledge, the child\u2019s entry into cognitive language. They are\nalso the sentences which are evidentially basic. What fits them to\nplay both roles is that they are (largely) independent of other parts\nof our language. Hence they can (largely) be mastered by a child\notherwise without linguistic competence, and known without\npresupposing other parts of our theory. (The reason for the\nqualification will become apparent at the end of this\nsub-section.)\n\nMany philosophers are content to take for granted the idea of an\nevidentially basic sentence. Quine, however, cannot take that\nattitude; he needs to show how we get \u201cfrom stimulus to\nscience\u201d. The first step is to show that we can give a purely\nnaturalistic account of how some linguistic utterances can be directly\ntied to the occurrence of stimulations of the sensory nerves---an\naccount of observation sentences, more or less. Quine expends enormous\nlabour on this point.\n\nQuine considers acts of assenting to sentences (or dissenting; but we\nshall mostly leave that as understood). He focuses, in particular, on\nour dispositions to assent to sentences. (We will briefly\nconsider the idea of a disposition in the next section.) To be an\nobservation sentence, a sentence must fulfill two criteria, one\nindividualistic and one social. The individualistic criterion is that\na sentence is an observation sentence for a given person if he or she\nis disposed to assent to it when, and only when, he or she is\nundergoing appropriate sensory stimulations, regardless of her\ninternal state (e.g. the ancillary information which he or she\npossesses). \u201cIt\u2019s warm in here\u201d presumably satisfies\nthis criterion; my willingness to assent to it perhaps depends only on\nwhich of my sensory nerves are stimulated at the given moment.\n\u201cThere\u2019s milk in the refrigerator\u201d presumably does\nnot; unless I am actually looking into the refrigerator at the time,\nmy willingness to assent to it depends not on what I am experiencing\nat the time but on my internal state, what I remember. The social\ncriterion is that the individualistic criterion should hold across the\nlinguistic community as a whole. To specify this more precisely is\ntricky, and we shall postpone the matter for a few paragraphs.\n\nEven the individualistic criterion raises considerable complications\nand difficulties. We speak of a disposition to assent (or dissent) in\nresponse to a pattern of stimulation but this is not quite accurate.\nSuch a pattern, a complete list of which sensory nerves are firing,\nand in which order, will hardly ever repeat itself. So what we need\nis, rather, the idea of a correlation of a response with a\ntype of stimulation\n pattern.[1]\n But the relevant idea of a type here is complicated. The physical\nresemblance of two stimulation patterns, what Quine calls\nreceptual similarity, is not enough to make them\nconstitute events of the same type, in the relevant sense; two such\npatterns may resemble each other very closely yet lead to quite\ndifferent responses. (Two occasions on which I am driving a car may be\nalmost identical in terms of my stimulation patterns, except that on\none occasion I see a red light and on the other I see a green light.\nAs far as my response goes, that small difference outweighs all the\nsimilarities.) What is wanted is a more complex notion which Quine\ncalls perceptual similarity. Very roughly, two stimulation\npatterns count as similar (for an animal, at a time) if they tend to\nlead to the same\n response.[2]\n\nWith the account of perceptual similarity in place, we can say what it\nis for a sentence to be observational for me: if I am disposed to\nassent to it on one occasion on which I have a certain neural intake,\nthen I will also be disposed to assent to it on any other occasion on\nwhich I have neural intake which is (sufficiently) perceptually\nsimilar for me at that time.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing the fact that the definition of the key notion\nof perceptual similarity is behavioural. It avoids any idea of\nexperience, of awareness, of what strikes the person (or other animal)\nas more similar to what. It is simply a matter of responses, and thus\nof behaviour. (Assent is also treated as behavior, as sound-making\npropensities; see 1975c pp. 87\u201388). This is in accord with\nQuine\u2019s insistence on what he takes to be scientific standards\nof clarity and rigour. One consequence of it is that the notion cannot\nbe invoked to explain behaviour. Quine is under no illusions\non this score. (See 1975c, 87, where the point is explicit.) The\nbehavioural account does not explain our understanding of\nobservation sentences; explanation, if possible at all, comes at the\nneuro-physiological level. What the behavioural account does is to\nmake clear exactly what behaviour constitutes that understanding and,\nhence, what the neuro-physiological account would have to explain. (It\nalso shows that there is indeed something to be explained.)\n\nSo far we have only an account of what it is for a sentence to be an\nobservation sentence for a particular person. But our language is\nshared, as it must be if it is to enable us to communicate with one\nanother. So we need to generalize the criterion across the linguistic\ncommunity. One might at first think that the social criterion would\nbe: if one person is disposed to assent to the sentence on any\noccasion on which he or she has a certain neural intake, then any\nother person having the same neural intake will also be disposed to\nassent to it. Quine gives essentially this account in (1960). As he\nquickly comes to see, however, it is not tenable, for it assumes that\nwe can make sense of the idea of \u201csame neural intake\u201d\nbetween different people. But different people have different sensory\nnerves (and there is no reason to suppose that one person\u2019s\nsensory nerves are homologous to those of others; see Quine 1969,\nchapter 6).\n\nQuine returned to this problem on and off over the next thirty-five\nyears. His eventual solution is that a sentence only counts as an\nobservation sentence if an occasion which leads to my having neural\nintake which disposes me to assent to it also leads to your having\nneural intake which disposes you to assent to it. Here there is no\ncross-person identification of neural intake or cross-person standards\nof perceptual similarity. On this account, however, there can only be\nobservation sentences if our standards of perceptual similarity line\nup in the right way. Two occasions which produce in me neural intakes\nwhich are perceptually similar by my standards must also (often\nenough) produce in you neural intakes which are perceptually similar\nby your standards. Quine is happy enough with this assumption of\nmutual attunement and suggests that it can be explained along\nevolutionary lines (see 1996, 160f., and for the whole story, Kemp\n2022, 805\u2013810).\n\nWe have been explaining the idea of our having shared responses to\nstimulation. For the most part, Quine assumes that assent to an\nobservation sentence simply is such a response. This assumption,\nhowever, cannot be quite correct. It may look for all the world as if\nthere were a rabbit in front of me, even though there is not. If I\nhave no reason to be suspicious I will be disposed to assent to\n\u201cRabbit?\u201d; if I know about the deception, however, I will\nnot be. So my disposition to assent does not, after all, depend solely\non my sensory stimulations at the time. It depends also on my internal\nstate, whether I know that in this case the rabbit-like appearance is\nmisleading. The difficulty arises because \u201cThere\u2019s a\nrabbit\u201d is corrigible, a feature which, on most accounts, it\nshares with just about every sentence other than those about the\nspeaker\u2019s current experience. If a sentence is corrigible then\nthere will be circumstances in which it is false, even though those\ncircumstances produce stimulation patterns which would generally lead\nobservers to assent to it. But then some observers may know that the\ncircumstances are of this deceptive kind and not be disposed to\nassent, while others have no such knowledge and are disposed to\nassent. The moral of this is that assent, even to observation\nsentences, is not a mere response to stimulation; the\nresponder\u2019s internal state (having ancillary knowledge, or not)\nmay also play a role.\n\nQuine does not seem to have fully appreciated this point, though some\nof his later discussions come close to doing so (see, in particular,\nQuine 1996). It is not fatal to his general account; it complicates\nthe story rather than requiring a radical change. There may be no\nsentences\u2014at least none that satisfy the social criterion for\nobservationality\u2014which can be wholly mastered simply by\nacquiring appropriate dispositions to assent and dissent in response\nto current stimulations. For some sentences, however, acquiring such\ndispositions comes close to mastering their use, because those\nsentences are almost always true in those cases where\nobservers receive sensory stimulations which dispose them to assent.\n(Clearly this will be a matter of degree.) So the acquisition of the\nrelevant dispositions, and partial mastery of the sentence, can be\nused as a basis on which the child can learn more of the language, and\nmore about the world. This further learning in turn allows the child\nto modify her or his original disposition to assent and dissent merely\nin response to current stimulation.\n4.3 More Complex Forms of Cognitive Language\n\nQuine\u2019s treatment of more sophisticated parts of language is\nnotably sketchier and more speculative than his detailed discussion of\nobservation sentences. In part this may be because he holds that it is\nmost important to understand the very first step into cognitive\nlanguage, how such language is possible at all. It may also be that\nthe difficulty of getting a satisfactory account of observation\nsentences impeded him.\n\nBeyond these points, however, there is, from a Quinean perspective, a\nlimit to how detailed an account we should expect to have of the\nacquisition of sophisticated cognitive language. Mastery of an\nobservation sentence corresponds (more or less) to a relatively\nstraightforward disposition: to assent when receiving a stimulation\npattern within a certain range. For most sentences, however, this is\nnot the case. What disposition must one have acquired in order to\ncount as understanding a sentence such as \u201cThe economy is in\nrecession\u201d? No doubt the disposition to assent in response to\nevidence is required, but what counts as evidence is almost\nunmanageably diffuse. In such a case, the links between sensory\nstimulation (such as that induced by the sight of words in a\nnewspaper) and assent are \u201cmultifarious [and] not easily\nreconstructed even in conjecture\u201d (1960, 11). A relatively\nclear-cut account, of the sort that Quine gives of observation\nsentences, is simply not available.\n\nSo Quine does not offer any sort of detailed account of the\nacquisition cognitive language beyond the observation sentences. (For\ncomparison of Quine\u2019s approach here with the very different\napproach of Chomsky, see Smith 2014.) Instead, he considers stages on\nthe way, forms of language which one might suppose could be easily\nacquired by a child who has mastered observation sentences and which\nmight provide steps leading to yet more advanced language.\n\nOne such step, which is emphasized in Quine\u2019s later work, is the\nmastery of what he calls observation categoricals (1981 p. 28) These\nare sentences of the form \u201cWhenever X [happens], Y\n[happens]\u201d, where the schematic letters are to be replaced by\nobservation sentences. (E.g. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s smoke,\nthere\u2019s fire.\u201d) It is plausible to suppose that a child\nwho has learnt the observation sentences can come by a mastery of the\nrelevant observation categorical. Observation sentences are what Quine\ncalls occasion sentences, true on some occasions and false on others,\nwhereas observation categoricals are eternal sentences, true or false\nonce for all. Quine suggests that we can think of observation\ncategoricals as a plausible first step towards a general mastery of\neternal sentences, which make up our serious theoretical\nknowledge.\n\nAnother step of the same kind is what Quine calls eternal\npredications, subject-predicate sentences true or false once for all,\nsuch as \u201cFido is a dog\u201d. Assuming the child has learnt\neach term as an observation sentence, the sight of the dog will\ndispose him to assent to each. Quine speculates that the sound of the\nword \u201cFido\u201d may have something of the same effect as the\nsight of the beast, inclining our learner to assent to\n\u201cDog\u201d and thus to \u201cFido is a dog\u201d. It is\nnotable that there is a sort of use-mention confusion operating here,\nif Quine\u2019s suggestion is correct. Language is learnt by\nconfusion and \u201cshort leaps of analogy\u201d rather than by\n\u201ccontinuous derivation\u201d (1975b, 77f.); indeed a holistic\nlanguage cannot be learnt without such leaps.\n\nA further advance, in Quine\u2019s view, takes place when the child\ncomes to use similar sentences but with two general terms, such as\n\u201cDogs are animals\u201d. Such a sentence, Quine remarks is\n\u2018\u2018really a universal categorical, \u2018Every \u03b1 is\na \u03b2\u2019.\u2019\u2019 (1974, 66). This kind of sentence, can\nbe represented using pronouns (\u201cIf something is a dog then it is\nan animal\u201d) or, more or less equivalently, using the logical\ndevice of quantifiers and variables. Such sentences have a particular\nimportance for Quine in connection with the idea of reference. Merely\nto be able to use a name, to be able to name Fido upon seeing him, for\nexample, is not yet to refer; one might simply be using the term as a\nresponse to the sight of the dog, hence as an observation sentence.\nReference, as Quine sees the matter, requires the capacity to\nreidentify the object over time and changing circumstances: if a dog\nis barking then it\u2014that very same dog\u2014is hungry; hence the\nimportance of pronouns.\n4.4 Other aspects of epistemology\n\nQuine also has things to say on more familiar epistemological themes.\nIn some cases he indicates how they can be integrated into his\napproach; thus he suggests that we can (albeit unrealistically)\nschematize the testing of a scientific theory by thinking of ourselves\nas deriving observation categoricals which can then be directly tested\nagainst observation sentences. In other cases he is content to adopt\nmore or less unchanged the account given by earlier authors, as in his\nlist of the virtues of a theory (see 1990a, 20). Our account above has\nstressed the most novel parts of his epistemology.\n\nOne issue left unaddressed above is the question whether Quine\u2019s\nnaturalized version of epistemology is normative. Some commentators\nhave claimed that it is not, and that this is a serious defect (see\nKim, 1988). Others claim that naturalized epistemology is normative\n(see Gregory, 2008). Quine himself has weighed in, saying that critics\n\u2018are wrong in protesting that the normative element\u2026goes\nby the board\u2019 (Quine 1990a, 19). He cites the \u2018finding of\nnatural science\u2026that our information about the world comes only\nthrough impacts on our sensory receptors\u2019 (Quine 1990a, 19) as\nbeing normative, \u2018warning us against telepaths and\nsoothsayers\u2019 (Quine 1990a, 19). More generally, naturalized\nepistemology is concerned with \u2018the whole strategy of rational\nconjecture in the framing of scientific hypotheses\u2019 (Quine\n1990a, 20).\n\nNaturalized epistemology is thus certainly normative in this sense: it\ntells us that in drawing up scientific theories we should\nrely on the evidence of the senses rather than on soothsayers; that we\nshould aim at simple theories, and so on. In telling us these\nthings, however, it relies on what we already know: it deploys some\nparts of our science to guide attempts in other areas. It does not\ntake a normative attitude towards science as a whole, criticizing or\njustifying it by wholly external, non-scientific standards. That would\nrequire a wholly extra-scientific position, an idea which Quine\nderogates as \u2018First Philosophy\u2019 (e.g. Quine 1981, 67). The\nrejection of any such idea is one way of phrasing the naturalism he\nadvocates.\n5. Metaphysics Naturalized\n\nQuine takes seriously the idea that \u201cit is within science\nitself, and not in some prior philosophy, that reality is to be\nidentified and described\u201d (1981, 21). It follows from this idea,\nas he construes it, that our best scientific theory of the world tells\nus as much as we know about reality. (Our best theory at given time\ntells us as much as we know at that time; no doubt our views will\nprogress.) So setting out the broad outlines of that theory is the\nQuinean version or analogue of metaphysics, though he does not much\nuse the word. This subject interacts with that of the last section:\nQuine\u2019s account of the world both lays down the constraints\nwithin which an account of knowledge must proceed, and is, in outline,\nthe knowledge that must be accounted for.\n5.1 Method: Regimented Theory\n\nHow does Quine think we should establish the sort of claims that we\nare calling \u201cmetaphysical\u201d? Some points are familiar from\nour discussion in section 2. First, we do not resort to any special\nkind of philosophical insight. Second, what matters is ordinary\nknowledge as refined and improved upon: science. Third, we rely upon\nthe idea of regimented theory, science formulated in a language that\nis clarified and simplified \u201cbeyond what might reasonably be\nurged upon the practicing scientist\u201d (1957, 235; see 2.4,\nabove). We rely upon ordinary usage where no better is to hand, but\naccept changes that are improvements (see 1960, 3). A further point is\nthat in striving for the clarity and simplicity of our theory we must\nconsider the whole theory; local gains may be offset by global losses.\nIt is thus to overall regimented theory that we look when we are\n\u201climning the true and ultimate structure of reality\u201d\n(1960, 221).\n\nWhat is Quine\u2019s justification for relying on the idea of\nregimented theory, rather than on our ordinary conceptual scheme? (Cf.\nStrawson, 1959, Introduction.) One part of the answer is that just as\nscience is in the same line of business as ordinary knowledge, but\ndoes it better, so regimented language is in the same business as\nordinary language, but does it better. Regimentation, that is to say,\nis not the imposition of a wholly foreign language; it is the adoption\nof a language that maximizes scientific virtues already partially\npresent in ordinary speech\u2014logical structure, reference, the\nready amenability to algorithmic methods. But another part of the\nanswer is the idea that \u201cour ordinary conceptual scheme\u201d\ndoes not pick out anything definite enough to answer metaphysical\nquestions. Thus Quine says: \u201c\u2026a fenced ontology is just\nnot implicit in ordinary language\u2026. Ontological concern is not\na correction of a lay thought and practice; it is foreign to the lay\nculture, though an outgrowth of it.\u201d (1981, 9).\n\nRegimentation, in Quine\u2019s view, involves paraphrase into logical\nnotation. Such paraphrase greatly clarifies and simplifies our theory.\nInferences which are a matter of logic will be revealed as such; where\nadditional assumptions are required it will be explicit just what is\nneeded. The logic which Quine takes as the structure of regimented\ntheory is classical (bivalent) first-order logic with identity.\nBivalence is justified on the grounds of simplicity. It is not that we\nhave some independent insight into the nature of the world which shows\nus that every sentence of regimented theory is either true or false.\nIt is, rather, that the simplicity that we gain from making this\nassumption, justifies our using a bivalent language; the metaphysical\nclaim follows along. (This reversal of direction should remind us of\nCarnap. The difference is that Quine does not accept the Principle of\nTolerance; see section 3, above.)\n\nQuine\u2019s choice of first-order logic, rather than second-order\nlogic, has been more controversial than his adoption of bivalence. One\nreason he gives for the decision is that every formalization of\nsecond-order logic (unlike first-order logic) is incomplete, relative\nto the standard semantics. A further reason is that one purpose of the\ncanonical framework is to enable us to assess the ontology of a\ntheory. From this point of view it is an advantage that first-order\nlogic has no ontological presuppositions of its own. (By adopting that\nlogic we do commit ourselves to there being some object or other, but\nnot to the existence of any particular entity.) Here again there is a\nclear contrast with second-order logic, which does have ontological\npresuppositions. Exactly what those presuppositions are is unclear,\nand has been debated; for Quine, this unclarity is a further reason to\navoid the subject entirely.\n\nParaphrasing a theory into classical logic imposes extensionality on\nit: a predicate may be replaced by a co-extensive predicate without\nchange of truth-value of the containing sentence; likewise an embedded\nsentence by a sentence of the same\n truth-value.[3]\n Extensionality imposes quite severe restrictions. It requires, for\nexample, that attributions of belief, and other propositional\nattitudes, be regimented into a form quite different from that which\nthey may appear to have. (For this reason, the commitment to\nextensionality is quite controversial; see F\u00f8llesdal 1986 and\nKaplan 1968, 1986.) So one might suppose that Quine accepts\nextensionality reluctantly, as the price to be paid for the advantages\nof the use of logic in regimenting theory. Such is not his attitude,\nhowever. To the contrary, he thinks of the clarity that extensionality\nbrings as a great advantage, and of theories that lack it as not fully\ncomprehensible: \u201cI find extensionality necessary, indeed, though\nnot sufficient, for my full understanding of a theory.\u201d (1995,\n90f.)\n5.2 Metaphysical Claims\n\nQuine\u2019s regimented theory, then, is the sum total of our\nknowledge, the best that we have, reformulated so as to fit into the\nframework of first-order logic. The extra-logical vocabulary consists\nonly of predicates. All metaphysical questions can thus be boiled down\nto two: What objects do the variables range over? and: What sorts of\nprimitive predicates are to be admitted?\n\nTo the first of these questions Quine offers a straightforward answer:\nhis ontology consists of physical objects and sets. We will say a\nlittle more about each. He counts as a physical object the matter\noccupying any portion of space-time, however scattered the portion and\nhowever miscellaneous the occupants; such an object need not be what\nhe calls a \u201cbody\u201d, such as a person or a tree or a\nbuilding (see 1981, 13). He briefly entertains the idea that we could\nmanage without postulating matter at all, simply using sets of\nspace-time points, where these are understood as sets of quadruples of\nreal numbers, relative to some co-ordinate system\u2014that is, an\nontology of abstract objects only. He seems to see no knock-down\nargument against this but abandons it, perhaps because the gain is too\nsmall to justify the magnitude of the departure from our ordinary\nviews. That he is willing to consider such a view, and take it\nseriously, shows something about his general attitude.\n\nBesides physical objects, Quine\u2019s ontology includes sets. Our\nordinary (unregimented) scientific theories require mathematical\nentities (numbers, functions, and so on). Set-theory enables us to\ndefine all those mathematical entities, and many non-mathematical\nentities, in clear and economical fashion; hence regimented theory\nadmits sets. Quine is often said to put forward an\n\u201cindispensability argument\u201d (sometimes known as \u201cthe\nQuine-Putnam indispensability argument\u201d) for the existence of\nmathematical entities. (And thus, it might be said, for Platonism,\nthough that is not a term that Quine favors.) The argument has been\nwell summed-up like this: \u201cthe indispensability of mathematics\nto empirical science gives us good reason to believe in the existence\nof mathematical entities\u201d (Quine 1976, 1991; see also the\nintroduction to the entry on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics).\n Taken very narrowly, it is correct to say that Quine endorses this\nargument. Our ordinary theories employ mathematical entities, and so\nregimented theory must give us some way of achieving the same effect;\nadmitting sets into our ontology is Quine\u2019s preferred method.\nBut ascribing that argument to Quine may be misleading if doing so is\ntaken to imply that he holds that there is some special problem about\nthe ontological status of sets, or mathematical entities, or abstract\nobjects in general, and that he employs the indispensability argument\nto solve that problem. For the mature Quine, there is no more of a\nproblem with realism about abstract entities than there is with\nrealism about concrete objects; indeed the distinction between the\nabstract and the concrete plays no significant role in his mature\nthought (see 1960, 233).  All questions of existence and reality\nare to be settled in the same way: entities exist if and only if the\nquantifiers of regimented theory range over them. \n\nQuine does not accept the existence of any abstract objects apart from\nsets. His ontology thus excludes other alleged abstracta, such as\nproperties, propositions (as distinct from sentences), and merely\npossible entities. The chief reason for his denial of the existence of\nsuch alleged entities is that he finds their identity-criteria\nunclear; he holds, quite generally, that we should not postulate\nentities without having clear identity-criteria for them. (This is the\nview that he sums up in the slogan \u201cno entity without\nidentity\u201d; see (1969, 23) and elsewhere.) Doing so would\nthreaten the clarity and definiteness which the notion of identity\nbrings to theory; local gains from postulating, say, propositions are\nnot worth this global loss. (For a contrary view about properties, see\nArmstrong 1980.)\n\nRegimented theory also has no place for mental entities, most\nobviously minds, if those are taken to be distinct from physical\nentities. The qualification is important. Many mental entities can be\nadmitted as special cases of physical objects. Thus my act of thinking\nabout Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem at a particular time can simply be\nidentified with my body during that period of time (see 1995, 87f.).\nThe things that we might want to say about my act of thinking (that it\nwas inspired, or stupid, or what have you) can simply be reconstrued\nas predicates true or false of physical objects. This is the view\nsometimes known as anomalous monism or as token-token identity theory,\nas distinct from type-type identity theory (see 1960, \u00a754, and\nDavidson 1980). I may think of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem  at\nmany times, over the years, and on each occasion that act is\nidentified with the physical state that I am in at the time.\nToken-token identity theory does not claim that these physical states\nhave anything in particular in common, still less that all acts of\nthinking about the theorem, including those of other people, have\nsomething in common. There is no claim that each act of thinking about\nthe theorem can be identified with, e.g. a repeatable pattern of the\nfiring of brain cells (hence the monism is \u2018anomalous\u2019).\nIt is enough for Quine\u2019s purposes that each particular act of\nthinking can be identified with a physical object. This ontological\nphysicalism might seem almost trivial; Quine speaks of it as\n\u201c[e]ffortless monism \u2026 form without substance\u201d\n(1995, 85). The view does, however, exclude disembodied minds and\nmental entities; Quine thinks that is no loss. Note that the view can\nbe construed either as eliminating mental entities or simply as\nidentifying them with physical objects. Quine prefers the latter\nphrasing but thinks there is no real difference here; cf. 1960,\n265.\n\nOn the issue of the admissibility of predicates, Quine\u2019s\nphysicalism is more complicated. (This is in keeping with his general\nidea that we can think of the predicates, rather than the ontology, as\n\u201cwhere the metaphysical action is\u201d; 1976, 504). The\nrequirement here is that the difference between a predicate\u2019s\nbeing true of a given object and its being false of it should, in all\ncases, be a physical difference: \u201cnothing happens in the world,\nnot the flutter of an eyelid, not the flicker of a thought, without\nsome redistribution of microphysical states\u2026. physics can\nsettle for nothing less\u201d (1981, 98). If a predicate such as\n\u201c\u2026is thinking about Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem\u201d\npicks out genuine events in the world then there is a physical\ndifference between its being true of a person and its not being true\nof them: a fact of the matter.\n\nA difficulty in making sense of this is that the idea of a\nphysical fact is not definitively specifiable. To tie the\nidea too closely to current physics would rule out fundamental changes\nin that subject; to leave it floating free might seem to allow\nanything at all to qualify. But clearly Quine does not mean just any\nsubject that someone might call by the name \u201cPhysics\u201d. He\nhas in mind a subject continuous with our physics, alike or superior\nin its coherence and in its explanatory power. (In particular, it\nwould not have \u201can irreducibly psychological annex\u201d:\n1986a, 403f.). If phenomena occurred which could not be explained by\nany theory of that kind, then Quine\u2019s physicalism would go by\nthe board.\n\nThe most controversial application of this view is to mental\nphenomena. Within that realm, Quine focuses on attributions of\npropositional attitudes, statements that so-and-so believes that\nsuch-and-such, or hopes that, or fears that, etc. (One reason for this\nfocus may be that his interest is primarily in human knowledge;\nanother that some other mental states, such as pain, can perhaps be\naccounted for by identifying them with certain types of\nneurophysiological events.)\n\nPropositional attitudes also raise a different kind of issue.\nAttributions of such attitudes violate extensionality. If Mary is the\nDean, still Tom\u2019s believing that the Dean sings well is not the\nsame as his believing that Mary sings well, since her accession to the\nDeanship may be unknown to him. Quine escapes this sort of problem by\ntaking an attribution of belief to express a relation between the\nbeliever and a sentence, understood to be, in the usual case,\nin the language of the ascriber (not the language of the believer,\nwhere the languages differ).\n\nIt is worth noting the idea of another sense of belief-ascription\nwhich would not be vulnerable even prima facie problems of\nextensionality: so-called de re belief, as distinct from\nde dicto belief. In the 1950s Quine argued that there must be\nsuch a sense. In the late 1960s, however, he abandoned the idea, for\nlack of clear standards of when it is correct to ascribe a de\nre belief to someone. (See Quine 1956 for a statement of the\ndistinction, and Quine 1973 for retraction.) Other philosophers,\nhowever, continue to hold the idea. (See, for example, Kaplan 1968,\nKripke 1979.)\n\nConstruing attributions of belief as statements of attitudes towards\nsentences gives them a syntax and an ontology that Quine can accept.\nThat does not, however, show that the idiom \u201cA believes\nthat p\u201d satisfies his physicalistic criterion, i.e.\nthat all statements of this form correspond to (physical) facts. The\nmatter is complicated. Quine certainly accepts that most uses of this\nidiom are factual. The relevant facts are neurophysiological states of\nthe person concerned, and those states are causally connected with\nactions which the person performs, or would perform under certain\ncircumstances, and which we would count as manifestations of the\nbelief, or lack of belief. (Assenting or dissenting when asked is one\nsuch action, but only one among a myriad.) In cases where we have\nevidence for or against the ascription of a belief to someone, the\nevidence consists in behaviour and there are presumably\nneurophysiological states which explain the behaviour. Those states\nare not in practice specifiable in neurophysiological terms.\nNevertheless, the person\u2019s being in those states is the physical\nfact in which the truth of the ascription consists. Even where there\nis no behaviour of the relevant kind, there may still be dispositions\nto behave in those ways under certain unrealized circumstances. The\ndispositions are the physical states in which the truth of the\nascription consists. So in most cases where we ascribe belief, there\nis a fact of the matter which makes the ascription true or false.\n(More on dispositions a few paragraphs hence.)\n\nThe belief idiom, however, also lends itself to use in other cases,\nwhere there is no fact of the matter. These are not merely cases in\nwhich we have no evidence. They are cases in which no behavioural\ntests which we might have carried out would have supplied evidence,\ncases in which there simply is nothing in the subject\u2019s\nneurophysiology, and hence nothing in their actual or potential\nbehaviour, which would decide the matter. Quine puts the point like\nthis: \u201cSome beliefs, perhaps belief in the essential nobility of\nman qua man, are\u2026 not readily distinguishable from mere lip\nservice, and in such cases there is no fact of the matter\u2026. But\nmost attributions or confessions of belief do make sense\u2026. The\nstates of belief, where real, are\u2026 states of nerves.\u201d\n(1986a, 429)\n\nQuine explicitly acknowledges that we could not in practice manage\nwithout idioms of propositional attitude, and that most uses of such\nidioms are entirely unobjectionable. But such idioms allow the\nformation of sentences which do not correspond to facts of the matter.\nFor that reason, Quine excludes them from regimented theory; they are\nnot be used when we are concerned with \u201climning the true and\nultimate structure of reality\u201d (1960, 221). (Some philosophers\nmight insist: \u2018Either you accept the concept of belief or you\ndon\u2019t\u2019. Quine would not agree; see 1986e for closely\nrelated remarks about the idea of knowing who someone is.)\n\nA somewhat similar point can be made about subjunctive or\ncounterfactual conditionals. Some are factual, but the general\ncounterfactual idiom allows for the formation of sentences which are\nnot factual. Like propositional attitudes, counterfactual conditionals\nhave an important role in our practical lives. They are also closely\nconnected with dispositions which, as we have seen, play a central\nrole in Quine\u2019s account of language and how it is learnt. The\nconnection is easily seen: to call an object fragile is to say that it\nwould break if it were dropped onto a hard surface\nfrom a significant height.\n\nQuine does not accept the general counterfactual idiom, \u201cif\nX were to happen then Y would happen\u201d, as part\nof regimented theory. As in the case of belief, the unrestricted use\nof this idiom allows us to form sentences whose truth-conditions are,\nat best, unclear. A famous example is the pair, presumably alluding to\nthe Korean war of the early 1950s: \u201cIf Caesar were in charge he\nwould use the atom bomb\u201d; \u201cIf Caesar were in charge he\nwould use catapults\u201d (see Quine 1960, 222); they seem equally\nplausible but they cannot both be true (for a response, see Lewis\n1973). In such cases, we have no reason to think that some (physical)\nfact is being claimed. Many dispositions, however, are perfectly\nacceptable by Quinean standards. To call the glass fragile is to\nattribute to it a structure which would lead its breaking under\ncertain circumstances; the structure is a physical state, even if we\ncannot in practice specify it in physical terms.\n\nQuine claims that the dispositions he relies on in his account of\nlanguage are like the case of fragility rather than the case of\nCaesar. The disposition to assent to an observation sentence when\nreceiving certain stimulations is a physical state of the person\nconcerned; in particular, presumably, of his or her brain. The claim\nthat a given person has such a disposition is thus a claim about the\nstate of a physical object. It is, moreover, a claim that we can test,\nat least under favourable conditions. There is no reason to exclude it\nfrom regimented theory.\n\nAnother idiom which Quine famously excludes from regimented theory is\nthat of modality, statements that such-and-such must be the\ncase, or cannot be the case, and so on. Such idioms have been\nthe subject of much discussion on the part of Quine and (especially)\nhis critics; the discussion here will be very brief. Technically,\nthere are similarities with the case of belief. There is prima\nfacie violation of extensionality which can, however, be avoided\nby taking necessity to apply to sentences; some philosophers have\nclaimed that there is a de re sense of necessity which does\nnot lead to even prima facie violations of extensionality.\nQuine allows that modal terms have a legitimate ordinary language use\n(\u2018possible\u2019 is sometimes used to mean something like: we\ncan\u2019t rule it out; see 1966, ch. 10). But his attitude towards\nthe philosophical use of the idea of modality, dividing truths into\nthe necessary and the possible, is far less sympathetic than his\nattitude towards belief; he is particularly unsympathetic towards the\nidea of de re necessity, which he sees as requiring\n\u201cAristotelian essentialism\u201d (Quine 1953, 155).\n\nWhat frames these critical points about necessity is that Quine holds\nthat regimented theory, the best and most objective statement of our\nknowledge, simply has no need for that notion. The benefit of\nincluding such idioms in regimented theory is not worth the cost in\nunclarity that it would bring.\n5.3 Truth\n\nTruth, in Quine\u2019s view, is immanent, as opposed to transcendent.\nIn accord with his fundamental naturalism, he sees judgments of truth\nas made from within our theory of the world. For this reason, he\nsympathizes with what is sometimes called disquotational theory of\ntruth: to say that a sentence is true is, in effect, to assert the\nsentence. Two qualifications must be made. First, the disquotational\nview is not a definition of \u201cis true\u201d. It enables\nus to eliminate the predicate from contexts in which it is applied to\na finite number of specific sentences, but not from contexts where it\nis applied to infinitely many. Contexts of the latter kind are of\nparticular importance to logical theory. We say, for example, that a\nconjunction is true just in case both conjuncts are true; here\n\u201cis true\u201d cannot be eliminated. (Unless, indeed, we ascend\nto a metalanguage and give a definition of truth for the object\nlanguage that we are concerned with, following Tarski 1933.) Second,\ncalling an eternal sentence true is in one way unlike asserting it. If\nwe subsequently change our verdict on it we say that we used to\nbelieve it but now we don\u2019t. We do not, however, say that it\nused to be true but now it isn\u2019t; rather we say that it was\nnever true. Quine, however, sees this as simply a point of usage, with\nno particular philosophical implications.\n6. Underdetermination of Theory by Evidence; Indeterminacy of Translation\n\nIn this section we take up two ideas much discussed by commentators.\nNeither is essential to Quine\u2019s overall philosophy, although in\neach case, but especially in the case of indeterminacy, the opposite\nclaim has been made. (See Ebbs, 1997; for a defense of the position\ntaken here, see Hylton, 2007.)\n6.1 Underdetermination\n\nThe basic idea of underdetermination is that two or more rival\ntheories might have all the same observational consequences, and thus\nbe empirically equivalent. Theory would thus be underdetermined by\nobservation. This might be held to call realism into question (as in\nvan Frassen 1980). Quine finds underdetermination harder to make sense\nof than might appear and, in any case, does not see a threat to\nrealism.\n\nIn Quine\u2019s idealized schematization of the relation between\ntheory and evidence, evidence for theory consists of observation\ncategoricals. (These latter can, in turn, be tested by observing or\ncontriving situations in which relevant observation sentences are\ntrue.) The case which most obviously poses a potential threat to\nrealism is that of a final global theory, a perfected and completed\nversion of our own. What if there are two or more such theories,\nequally simple, each of which implies all true observation\ncategoricals? (Note that the theory will not be implied by\nall the true observation categoricals; apart from other\nconsiderations, some sentences of the theory will essentially contain\nterms which do not occur in observation categoricals.)\n\nQuine is often thought to accept underdetermination. But in fact he\nholds that there is considerable difficulty in making non-trivial\nsense of the doctrine. He identifies theories with sets of sentences,\nnot with sets of sentence-meanings (propositions). So we can quite\ntrivially obtain an empirically equivalent alternative to any theory:\nsimply spell one of the theoretical terms differently at every\noccurrence. Strictly speaking, the result is a different set of\nsentences which implies all the same observation categoricals (1975a,\n319). The difference from the original theory, however, is merely\northographic; this possibility is clearly not of any philosophical\nsignificance.\n\nA closely related point can be made in terms of translation.\nTranslation of observation categoricals is quite unproblematic in\nprinciple. So we can count two theories as empirically equivalent not\nmerely if they imply the same observation categoricals but also if\nthey imply intertranslatable observation categoricals. So classical\nphysics as formulated in English (say) would, by this criterion, count\nas empirically equivalent to classical physics as formulated in\nGerman, yet the two formulations are, strictly speaking, different\ntheories. Quite generally, any theory is empirically equivalent to its\ntranslation into any other language. But this fact is also not of any\ngreat philosophical significance, and certainly poses no threat to\nrealism.\n\nIn order to threaten realism, a version of underdetermination would\nthus have to assert that our postulated complete global theory of the\nworld has empirically equivalent alternatives and that no translation\nfrom one theory to the other is possible. Since the predicates of the\ntheory are its only non-logical vocabulary, this is equivalent to\nsaying that we cannot obtain one from the other by reconstruing the\npredicates of the theory. Quine comments: \u201cThis, for me, is an\nopen question.\u201d (1975a, 327). Much of his subsequent discussion\nof underdetermination takes place in terms of the weaker idea that our\ntheory might have empirically equivalent alternatives and that\n\u201cwe would see no way of reconciling [them] by\nreconstrual of predicates\u201d (loc. cit, emphasis added;\ncf. also 1990a, 97).\n\nIf some version of underdetermination were true, how should we\nrespond? This is an issue on which Quine has not merely changed his\nmind but vacillated, going back and forth between what he calls the\n\u201csectarian\u201d and the \u201cecumenical\u201d responses.\nThe sectarian response is to say that we should not let the existence\nof the alternative in any way affect our attitude towards our own\ntheory: we should continue to take it seriously, as uniquely telling\nus the truth about the world. (We are assuming that the two theories\npossess all theoretical virtues to equal degree; clearly Quine would\nsay that if one theory were superior in some way then we would have\nreason to adopt it.) The ecumenical response, by contrast, counts both\ntheories as true. In almost his last word on the subject he suggests\nthat there may be little at stake since the \u201cfantasy of\nirresolubly rival systems of the world\u201d takes us \u201cout\nbeyond where linguistic usage has been crystallized by use\u201d\n(1990a, 100f).\n\nQuine can afford to vacillate because, in his view, nothing very much\nturns on the issue. In particular, he never holds that\nunderdetermination, in any version, would threaten realism; at no time\ndoes he suggest that it casts doubt on the truth of our theory. That\nis not what is in question between the sectarian and the ecumenical\npositions; all that is in question is whether the alternative theory\nshould also be counted as true. Nor is this surprising. The\nterms in which underdetermination is stated, such as observation\ncategoricals, are part of our theory, as would be the demonstration\nthat another theory was empirically equivalent. The point here is the\nnaturalism which we have emphasized throughout. Nothing in our\nepistemology pronounces on the status of theory from an independent\nstandpoint; to the contrary: it presupposes the truth of our theory.\nThis central idea is not cast in doubt by underdetermination. (See\nSevero 2008; for criticism, see Moore 2015 and for a rejoinder to\nMoore see Kemp 2016.)\n6.2 Indeterminacy of Translation\n\nThe general claim of the indeterminacy of translation is that there\nmight be different ways of translating a language which are equally\ncorrect but which are not mere stylistic variants. The claim includes\nwhat one might think of as the limiting case of translation, that in\nwhich a given language is \u2018translated\u2019 into itself.\n\nSome philosophers hold that the idea of indeterminacy is absurd, or\nthat it amounts to an extreme form of scepticism about whether we ever\nunderstand one another, or whether correct translation is possible at\nall. (See for example Searle, 1987; for a reply, see F\u00f8llesdal,\n1990.) It is not hard to see how such opinions arise. One picture of\ncommunication is like this: you have an idea, a determinate meaning,\nin your mind and convey it to me by your utterance. To those who have\nthat picture, indeterminacy threatens the whole idea of communication,\nfor it suggests that the conveying is always vulnerable to drastic\nfailure. In the case of translation, the analogous view is that\nsynonymy, or sameness of meaning, is the criterion of correct\ntranslation; in that case, indeterminacy may appear as a denial that\ntranslation is possible at all.\n\nSuch views, however, take for granted a view of communication, or of\ntranslation, which is very far from Quine\u2019s. For Quine, the\ncriterion of successful communication, whether or not it involves\ntranslation, is fluent interaction, verbal and nonverbal:\n\u201cSuccess in communication is judged by smoothness of\nconversation, by frequent predictability of verbal and nonverbal\nreactions, and by coherence and plausibility of native\ntestimony.\u201d (1990a, 43) This is a third person or external view\nof language and communication, as required by Quine\u2019s\nnaturalism. From this point of view, talk of synonymy and of ideas in\nthe mind is simply a theoretical gloss which is (at best) in need of\njustification. Quine doubts that the gloss is justifiable; scepticism\nabout the theorizing, however, is not scepticism about the data.\nSmooth communication certainly occurs, sometimes in cases where\ndifferent languages are involved. Quine says nothing that casts doubt\non the idea that successful translation (by his criterion) is\npossible; his claim, indeed, is that it may be possible in more than\none way.\n\nAt this point we need to distinguish two kinds of indeterminacy. Quine\nintroduces the general idea of indeterminacy, in Chapter Two of\n(1960), without explicitly distinguishing the two, but subsequently\ncomes to treat them quite differently. The first is indeterminacy\nof reference: some sentences can be translated in more than one\nway, and the various versions differ in the reference that they\nattribute to parts of the sentence, but not in the overall net import\nthat they attribute to the sentence as a whole. (Quine uses the terms\n\u201contological relativity\u201d and \u201cinscrutability of\nreference\u201d, as well as \u201cindeterminacy of reference\u201d.\nSome philosophers have sought to distinguish these doctrines, but in\nlater work Quine makes it clear that he uses the terms simply as\ndifferent names for the same thing. See Ricketts 2011, Roth, 1986, and\nQuine 1986d.) To use an example which has become famous, a given\nsentence might be translated as \u201cThere\u2019s a rabbit\u201d\nor as \u201cRabbithood is manifesting itself there\u201d or as\n\u201cThere are undetached rabbit parts\u201d, or in other ways\nlimited only by one\u2019s ingenuity. All that is needed is what\nQuine calls a proxy function, which maps each object onto another\nobject and each predicate onto one which is true of a given\nproxy-object if and only if the original predicate is true of the\noriginal object. For terms referring to physical objects, he suggests,\nwe can take the proxy-function to map each object onto its space-time\ncomplement. The change to the translation of singular terms and the\nchange to the translation of predicates cancel out, leaving the\noverall significance of the sentence unchanged. The claim of\nindeterminacy of reference is not in any way a claim about what goes\non in the language-user\u2019s mind (pace Wright 1997).\n(Note that it will not help to ask the person we are translating\nwhether she means to refer to the family dog or to its space-time\ncomplement: her answer is subject to the same indeterminacy.)\n\nIndeterminacy of reference is akin to a view of theoretical entities\nput forward by Ramsey: that there is no more to such an entity than\nthe role that it plays in the structure of the relevant theory (see\nRamsey, 1931). For Quine, however, the point holds for all objects,\nsince he \u201csee[s] all objects as theoretical\u2026. Even our\nmost primordial objects, bodies, are already theoretical\u201d (1981,\n20). Quine holds, moreover, that considerations akin to those of the\nprevious paragraph amount to a \u201ctrivial proof\u201d of\nindeterminacy of reference (1986c, 728).\n\nThe second kind of indeterminacy, which Quine sometimes refers to as\nholophrastic indeterminacy, is another matter. Here the claim\nis that there is more than one correct method of translating sentences\nwhere the two translations of a given sentence differ not merely in\nthe meanings attributed to the sub-sentential parts of speech but also\nin the net import of the whole sentence. (Hence the two translations\nwould express different propositions, in the abstract sense, or\ndifferent Fregean Gedanke; Quine claims that undermining\nthese ideas was part of his motivation in developing the doctrine; see\n1990d.) This claim involves the whole language, so there are no\nexamples, except perhaps of an exceedingly artificial kind. There is\nalso nothing resembling a proof; in some late works, indeed, Quine\nrefers to it as a \u201cconjecture\u201d (1986c, 728). At some\nearlier points, he seems to think that sufficiently clear-headed\nreflection on what goes into translation will suffice to make the idea\nat least plausible. All that can be required of a method of\ntranslation is that it enables us to get along with the speakers of\nthe other language: why should there not be more than one way\nto do it?\n\nArguments have been offered for holophrastic indeterminacy based on\nthe idea of underdetermination of theory by evidence (by Quine himself\nin his 1970) . Perhaps there is determinate translation of observation\nsentences, and thus of observation categoricals. Still, if each two\ndistinct theories is compatible with all observational truths, surely\nwe could plausibly attribute either theory to the speaker of the other\nlanguage. The weakness of this kind of argument is that translation\nmust presumably preserve more than links between sentences and\nstimulations, as captured by observation sentences; it must also\npreserve links among sentences, links which make it more or less\nlikely that a person who accepts a given sentence will also accept\nanother. Could there be methods of translation which preserved both\nkinds of links but nevertheless yielded different results?\nQuine\u2019s term \u201cconjecture\u201d seems apt.\n\nGiven the interpretation advanced in section 3, above, indeterminacy\nis not crucial for Quine\u2019s rejection of the sort of use that\nCarnap makes of the idea of analyticity. He has other arguments on\nthat score, as we saw. More generally, on the interpretation advanced\nhere, indeterminacy is not a crucial part of Quine\u2019s overall\nview. His coming to speak of it as conjectural, while not questioning\nother parts of his philosophy, suggests that he would accept this. If\nwe were sure that translation is determinate, we could perhaps use the\nidea to define a notion of synonymy. (Agnosticism here favours the\ncontrary position.) And, as Quine has indicated, we could then define\nthe meaning of an expression as the set of synonymous expressions.\nSuch a notion of meaning might make some difference. It might, for\nexample, provide a criterion of identity which enabled us to accept\nbeliefs as entities. It would not, however, play the most important\nroles in which philosophers have cast the idea of meaning. In\nparticular, it would not play a role in the explanation of how we\nunderstand our language, or of how communication between persons takes\nplace.\n7. Quine\u2019s place in the history of philosophy\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, many scientifically-oriented philosophers\ntended to assume some form of Logical Empiricism. One important aspect\nof Quine\u2019s influence on the course of philosophy is that he\ncalled that view or nexus of views into question (see section 3,\nabove). Some of his criticisms are detailed and technical. His target,\nhowever, was not a technical detail but the fundamental idea of\nLogical Empiricism, that there is a distinction between analytic\ntruths and synthetic truths which can account for a priori\ntruth. After Quine\u2019s work of the early 1950s, philosophers, even\nthose who did not accept his detailed arguments could no longer take\nit for granted that some form of Logical Empiricism is correct. This\nwas a very major change among scientifically-oriented\nphilosophers.\n\nQuine\u2019s rejection of Logical Empiricism leads him to two\n(connected) views which have been extremely influential. First, he\nrejects the idea of a distinction between philosophy on the one hand\nand empirical science on the other hand. To the contrary: he sees\nphilosophy as essentially in the same line of work as science, but\nmostly concerned with more theoretical and abstract questions. This is\nan integral part of his naturalism. Second, his criticism of Carnap,\nand of the Principle of Tolerance in particular, opens the way for\nsomething that might be called metaphysics: for very general\nreflections on the nature of the world, based on the best scientific\nknowledge that we have and on claims about how that knowledge might be\norganized so as to maximize its objectivity and clarity.\n\nBoth of these Quinean views, his naturalism and his acceptance of\nsomething like metaphysics, correspond to very important developments\nwithin analytic philosophy over the past half-century. His influence\nhas surely played a significant role here. (In the case of\nmetaphysics, in particular, it is notable that two leading figures,\nSaul Kripke and David Lewis, were students of Quine\u2019s.) For the\nmost part, however, those Quinean doctrines have led to work to which\nQuine himself would be strongly opposed.\n\nIn the case of naturalism, many philosophers have welcomed the idea\nthat they are free to use concepts and results drawn from empirical\nscience. Fewer have accepted that philosophy should also be\nconstrained by scientific standards of clarity, of evidence, and of\nexplanatoriness. The result is that while views which claim to accept\nnaturalism are common, those which accept Quine\u2019s standards of\nwhat counts as reputable naturalistic philosophy are not.\n\nThe case of metaphysics is similar but perhaps more extreme. Quine\naccepts that the philosopher is in a position to make very general\nclaims about the world (that there are sets but not properties, for\nexample). In his hands, such claims are answerable to the idea of a\ntotal system of our scientific knowledge, regimented so as to maximize\nclarity and systematicity. Many philosophers have welcomed the freedom\nto speculate about the nature of the world but have not accepted\nQuine\u2019s constraints on the process. The result is a flourishing\nof metaphysics, often based on ordinary (unregimented) language or on\nthe alleged deliverances of \u2018intuition\u2019; much of this work\nwould be anathema to Quine. (See Rosen 2014.)\n\nOn the one hand, then, Quine\u2019s work has been extremely\ninfluential and has done much to shape the course of philosophy in the\nsecond-half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. On the\nother hand, much of the work directly or indirectly influenced by\nQuine is of a sort that he would have thought quite misguided.\n",
