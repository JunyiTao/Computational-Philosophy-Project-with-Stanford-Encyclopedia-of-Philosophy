    "main_text": "The Definition of Logic\n5. The Definition of Logic\n\nIn his [Demonstration] (64.5\u20137)\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tells us:\n\n\nTwo arts or sciences differ through having different subjects\n(maw\u1e0d\u016b\u2018). If their subjects are identical\nthen the arts or sciences are identical; if their subjects are\ndifferent then the arts or sciences are different. Their subjects can\ndiffer either by having different features (a\u1e25w\u0101l,\nsingular \u1e25\u0101l) or in themselves. \n\n\nThus an art or science\u2014al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is very little\nexercised about the difference between the two\u2014studies some\nentities called its subjects, and it ascribes to these entities some\nfeatures. Like other Aristotelians, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b flips\nbetween saying (for example) that the subjects of arithmetic are\nnumbers and that the subject of arithmetic is number; the two\nlocutions mean the same.\n\nIn [Letters] sections 11\u201318 al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nundertakes to identify several arts or sciences in these terms, namely\n\u201cthe art of logic and the sciences of nature, politics,\nmathematics and metaphysics\u201d. The first step is to identify\ntheir subjects. In all these cases, he says, the \u201cprimary\nsubjects\u201d are the primary concepts ([Letters] 66.20f).\nFor example, in mathematics we study primary concepts from the point\nof view of quantity, abstracting from their other features\n([Letters] (15) 67.19\u201368.5). (See Druart 2007 and Menn\n2008 on the important question of how metaphysics fits into this\npicture.)\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tells us what features of the primary\nconcepts are studied in logic:\n\n\nInsofar as [the primary concepts] are signified by expressions, and\ninsofar as they are universals, and insofar as they are predicates or\nsubjects, and insofar as they are defined in terms of each other, and\ninsofar as they are asked about and taken in a question about them,\nthey are logical. They are taken so as to investigate the compounds of\nthem, one with another, where the aforementioned things attach to\nthem, and the features of the compounds after they have been\ncompounded. ([Letters] (12)\n 67.1\u20135).[13]\n\n\n\nHe gives no examples, but here is one. In his book\n[Syllogism] 27.6f he claims that the following argument is a\nvalid syllogism: \n\n\nNo stone is an animal. Some body is an animal.\n\nThis yields: Some body is not a stone.\n\n\nWe can paraphrase his claim: \n\n\n(*)\nIf a first sentence is taken as universal negative with subject\n\u201cstone\u201d and predicate \u201canimal\u201d, and a second\nsentence is existential affirmative etc., and a third sentence etc.,\nthen the third sentence follows from the first two.\n\n\n\nThis paraphrase (*) illustrates why \u201cpredicate\u201d and\n\u201csubject\u201d are listed among the logical features, and also\nwhy logic has to consider compounds of primary concepts (since the\nthree sentences express propositions, which are compounds of\nconcepts). Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s reference to being\n\u201casked about and taken in a question about them\u201d could\nrefer either to dialectical questions, or to the questions that\nextract information about concepts, or possibly to both.\n\nThe features listed as characterizing the art of logic are concepts\nthat classify other concepts, and so they are secondary concepts. This\ndistinguishes logic from mathematics and natural science. For example,\nnatural science finds causes, but these causes are \u201cnot outside\nthe categories\u201d ([Letters] (16) 68.17).\n\nBy describing simple primary concepts as the \u201cfirst\u201d or\n\u201cprimary\u201d subjects of logic, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nsuggests that there might be further subjects of logic. This makes\nsense; why shouldn\u2019t the rules of logic apply to secondary\nconcepts just as much as to primary concepts? In fact the way\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b has set things up would allow him to explain\nhow this should go. Laws about secondary concepts will need tertiary\nconcepts. But there is no need to restate the laws of logic using\ntertiary concepts, because \u201cthe features that attach to the\nprimary concepts are exactly the same as those that attach to the\nsecondary concepts\u201d, and so on all the way up\n([Letters] (9) 65.16f). \n\nThere is an obvious criticism of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\ndefinition of logic, namely that the features that he lists are too\nvague. For example, how could we use his list to determine whether the\nart of poetry is or is not a part of logic? The real problem is that\nfor al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b himself with his Neoplatonic heritage,\nlogic consists of whatever Aristotle said in the Organon, and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b never comes near finding any abstract way of\ncharacterizing this body of\n material.[14]\n\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b gives an even vaguer characterization of the\nsubjects of logic in his [Catalogue] (59.9\u201311):\n\n\nAs for the subjects of logic, about which it gives rules, they are\nconcepts insofar as expressions signify them, and expressions insofar\nas they signify concepts.\n\n\nThis definition could have been copied from a text in the Neoplatonic\ntradition.\n\nWe return briefly to the question why al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nincludes the subject of categories in a logic syllabus. Commentaries\nin the Alexandrian tradition normally started with a statement of the\npurpose of the material to be discussed.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s epitome [Categories] has no\nsuch statement, but the surviving fragments of the longer\n[Commentary on Categories] do address the question. They tell\nus (p. 196) that Aristotle\u2019s Categories was intended to\ncatalogue the simple universal primary concepts, but Aristotle found\nit sufficient to catalogue the ten supreme genera instead. Some people\n(p. 202) didn\u2019t think Categories was specifically\nintended for logic; but \u201cunder the conditions we have mentioned,\nthe contents of Categories turn out to be a specific part of\nlogic\u201d. But in fact no such conditions have been mentioned, at\nleast in the surviving fragments. What needs to be shown is that the\nfeatures (the a\u1e25w\u0101l) of categories studied in the\nfirst book of the syllabus are ones that will serve some purpose in\nlater books. But this issue is not addressed at all.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b does address it in [Rhetoric]\n87.16\u201389.4, where he says that the terms of premises can be in\nany of the ten supreme genera, in any combination. This only confirms\nthe suspicion that the supreme genera are irrelevant to logical\nreasoning.\n",
