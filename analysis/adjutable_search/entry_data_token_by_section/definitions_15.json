Thus, the traditional\ntheory allows the following definitions of, respectively,\n\u201cliar\u201d and the class of natural numbers\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\):\n\n(22)\n\\(z\\) is a liar \\(\\eqdf\\) all propositions asserted by \\(z\\) are\nfalse;\n(23)\n\\(z\\) belongs to \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) \\(\\eqdf\\) \\(z\\) belongs to every\ninductive class, where a class is inductive when it contains 0 and is\nclosed under the successor operation.\n\n\nRussell argued that such definitions involve a subtle kind of vicious\ncircle. The definiens of the first definition invokes, Russell\nthought, the totality of all propositions, but the definition, if\nlegitimate, would result in propositions that can only be defined by\nreference to this totality. Similarly, the second definition attempts\nto define the class \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) by reference to all classes, which\nincludes the class \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) that is being defined. Russell\nmaintained that such definitions are illegitimate. And he imposed the\nfollowing requirement\u2014called, the \u201cVicious-Circle\nPrinciple\u201d\u2014on definitions and concepts. (Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 had also proposed a similar idea.)\n\nVicious-Circle Principle. \u201cWhatever involves\nall of a collection must not be one of the collection\n(Russell 1908, 63).\u201d\n\nAnother formulation Russell gave of the Principle is this:\n\nVicious-Circle Principle (variant formulation).\n\u201cIf, provided a certain collection had a total, it would have\nmembers only definable in terms of that total, then the said\ncollection has no total (Russell, 1908, 63).\u201d\n\nIn an appended footnote, Russell explained, \u201cWhen I say that a\ncollection has no total, I mean that statements about all its\nmembers are nonsense.\u201d\n\nRussell\u2019s primary motivation for the Vicious-Circle Principle\nwere the logical and semantic paradoxes. Notions such as\n\u201ctruth,\u201d \u201cproposition,\u201d and\n\u201cclass\u201d generate, under certain unfavorable conditions,\nparadoxical conclusions. Thus, the claim \u201cCheney is a\nliar,\u201d where \u201cliar\u201d is understood as in (16), yields\nparadoxical conclusions, if Cheney has asserted that he is a liar, and\nall other propositions asserted by him are, in fact, false. Russell\ntook the Vicious-Circle Principle to imply that if \u201cCheney is a\nliar\u201d expresses a proposition, it cannot be in the scope of the\nquantifier in the definiens of (16). More generally, Russell held that\nquantification over all propositions, and over all classes, violates\nthe Vicious-Circle Principle and is thus illegitimate. Furthermore, he\nmaintained that expressions such as \u2018true\u2019 and\n\u2018false\u2019 do not express a unique concept\u2014in\nRussell\u2019s terminology, a unique \u201cpropositional\nfunction\u201d\u2014but one of a hierarchy of propositional\nfunctions of different orders. Thus the lesson Russell drew from the\nparadoxes is that the domain of the meaningful is more restricted than\nit might ordinarily appear, that the traditional account of concepts\nand definitions needed to be made more restrictive in order to rule\nout the likes of (16) and (17).\n\nIn application to ordinary, informal definitions, the Vicious-Circle\nPrinciple does not provide, it must be said, a clear method of\ndemarcating the meaningful from the meaningless. Definition (16) is\nsupposed to be illegitimate because, in its definiens, the quantifier\nranges over the totality of all propositions. And we are told that\nthis is prohibited because, were it allowed, the totality of\npropositions \u201cwould have members only definable in terms of the\ntotal.\u201d However, unless we know more about the nature of\npropositions and of the means available for defining them, it is\nimpossible to determine whether (16) violates the Principle. It may be\nthat a proposition such as \u201cCheney is a liar\u201d\u2014or, to\ntake a less contentious example, \u201cEither Cheney is a liar or he\nis not\u201d\u2014 can be given a definition that does not appeal to\nthe totality of all propositions. If propositions are sets of possible\nworlds, for example, then such a definition would appear to be\nfeasible.\n\nThe Vicious-Circle Principle serves, nevertheless, as an effective\nmotivation for a particular account of legitimate concepts and\ndefinitions, namely that embodied in Russell\u2019s Ramified Type\nTheory. The idea here is that one begins with some unproblematic\nresources that involve no quantification over propositions, concepts,\nand such. These resources enable one to define, for example, various\nunary concepts, which are thereby assured of satisfying the\nVicious-Circle Principle. Quantification over these concepts is thus\nbound to be legitimate, and can be added to the language. The same\nholds for propositions and for concepts falling under other types: for\neach type, a quantifier can be added that ranges over items (of that\ntype) that are definable using the initial unproblematic resources.\nThe new quantificational resources enable the definition of further\nitems of each type; these, too, respect the Principle, and again,\nquantifiers ranging over the expanded totalities can legitimately be\nadded to the language. The new resources permit the definition of yet\nfurther items. And the process repeats. The result is that we have a\nhierarchy of propositions and of concepts of various orders. Each type\nin the type hierarchy ramifies into a multiplicity of orders. This\nramification ensures that definitions formulated in the resulting\nlanguage are bound to respect the Vicious-Circle Principle. Concepts\nand classes that can be defined within the confines of this scheme are\nsaid to be predicative (in one sense of this word); the\nothers, impredicative.\n\nFor further discussion of the Vicious-Circle Principle, see Russell\n1908, Whitehead and Russell 1925, G\u00f6del 1944, and Chihara 1973.\nFor a formal presentation of Ramified Type Theory, see Church 1976;\nfor a more informal presentation, see Hazen 1983.
