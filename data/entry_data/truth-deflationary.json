    "preamble": "\n\nDeflationism about truth, what is often simply called\n\u201cdeflationism\u201d, is really not so much a theory of\ntruth in the traditional sense, as it is a different, newer sort\nof approach to the topic. Traditional theories of truth are part of a\nphilosophical debate about the nature of a supposed property of truth.\nPhilosophers offering such theories often make suggestions like the\nfollowing: truth consists in correspondence to the facts; truth\nconsists in coherence with a set of beliefs or propositions; truth is\nwhat is acceptable in the ideal limit of inquiry. According to\ndeflationists, such suggestions are mistaken, and, moreover, they all\nshare a common mistake. The common mistake is to assume that truth\nhas a nature of the kind that philosophers might find out\nabout and develop theories of. The main idea of the deflationary\napproach is (a) that all that can be significantly said about truth is\nexhausted by an account of the role of the expression\n\u2018true\u2019 or of the concept of truth in our talk and thought,\nand (b) that, by contrast with what traditional views assume, this\nrole is neither metaphysically substantive nor explanatory. For\nexample, according to deflationary accounts, to say that \u2018snow\nis white\u2019 is true, or that it is true that snow is white, is in\nsome sense strongly equivalent to saying simply that snow is white,\nand this, according to the deflationary approach, is all that can be\nsaid significantly about the truth of \u2018snow is white\u2019.\nPhilosophers looking for some underlying nature of some truth property\nthat is attributed with the use of the expression \u2018true\u2019\nare bound to be frustrated, the deflationist says, because they are\nlooking for something that isn\u2019t there.\n\nDeflationism comprises a variety of different versions, each of which\nhave gone by different names, including at least the following:\ndisquotationalism, minimalism, prosententialism, the redundancy\ntheory, the disappearance theory, the no-truth theory. There has not\nalways been terminological consensus in the literature about how to\nuse these labels: sometimes they have been used interchangeably;\nsometimes they have been used to mark distinctions between different\ndevelopments of the same general approach. The actual variety of\ndeflationary views has not always been clear in discussions of this\napproach, especially in the earlier literature, where important\ndifferences are occasionally missed. To help clear this up, we will\nuse \u2018deflationism\u2019 to denote the general approach we want\nto discuss and reserve other names for specific versions of that\napproach.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Central Themes in Deflationism\n1.1 The Equivalence Schema\n\nWhile deflationism can be developed in different ways, it is possible\nto isolate some central themes emphasized by most philosophers who\nthink of themselves as deflationists. These shared themes pertain to\nendorsing a kind of metaphysical parsimony and positing a\n\u201cdeflated\u201d role for what we can call the alethic\nlocutions (most centrally, the expressions \u2018true\u2019 and\n\u2018false\u2019) in the instances of what is often called\ntruth-talk. In this section, we will isolate three of these\nthemes. The first, and perhaps most overarching, one has already been\nmentioned: According to deflationists, there is some strong\nequivalence between a statement like \u2018snow is white\u2019 and a\nstatement like \u201c\u2018snow is white\u2019 is true,\u201d and\nthis is all that can significantly be said about that application of\nthe notion of truth.\n\nWe may capture this idea more generally with the help of a schema,\nwhat is sometimes called the equivalence schema:\n\n(ES)\n\\(\\langle p\\rangle\\) is true if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n\n\nIn this schema, the angle brackets indicate an appropriate\nname-forming or nominalizing device, e.g., quotation marks or\n\u2018the proposition that \u2026\u2019, and the occurrences of\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 are replaced with matching declarative sentences\nto yield instances of the schema.\n\nThe equivalence schema is often associated with the formal work of\n Alfred Tarski\n (1935 [1956], 1944), which introduced the schema,\n\n(T)\n\\(X\\) is true if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n\n\nIn the instances of schema (T) (sometimes called \u201cConvention\n(T)\u201d), the \u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 gets filled in with a name of the\nsentence that goes in for the \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019, making (T) a\nversion of (ES). Tarski considered (T) to provide a criterion of\nadequacy for any theory of truth, thereby allowing that there could be\nmore to say about truth than what the instances of the schema cover.\nGiven that, together with the fact that he took the instances of (T)\nto be contingent, his theory does not qualify as deflationary.\n\nBy contrast with the Tarskian perspective on (T)/(ES), we can\nformulate the central theme of deflationism under consideration as the\nview, roughly, that the instances of (some version of) this schema do\ncapture everything significant that can be said about applications of\nthe notion of truth; in a slogan, the instances of the schema\nexhaust the notion of truth. Approaches which depart from\ndeflationism don\u2019t disagree that (ES) tells us something about\ntruth; what they (with Tarski) deny is that it is exhaustive, that it\ntells us the whole truth about truth. Since such approaches add\nsubstantive explanations of why the instances of the equivalence\nschema hold, they are now often called inflationary\napproaches to truth. Inflationism is the general approach shared by\nsuch traditional views as the\n correspondence theory of truth,\n coherence theory of truth,\n pragmatic theory of truth,\n identity theory of truth, and primitivist theory of truth, These theories all share\na collection of connected assumptions about the alethic locutions, the\nconcept of truth, and the property of truth. Inflationary theories all\nassume that the expression \u2018is true\u2019 is a descriptive\npredicate, expressing an explanatory concept of truth, which\ndetermines a substantive property of truth. From that shared set of\npresuppositions, the various traditional inflationary theories then\ndiverge from one another by providing different accounts of the\nassumed truth property. On inflationary views, the nature of the truth\nproperty explains why the instances of (ES) hold. Deflationary views,\nby contrast, reject some if not all of the standard assumptions that\nlead to inflationary theories, resisting at least their move to\npositing any substantive truth property. Instead, deflationists offer\na different understanding of both the concept of truth and the\nfunctioning of the alethic locutions. A deflationist will take the\ninstances of (ES) to be \u201cconceptually basic and explanatorily\nfundamental\u201d (Horwich 1998a, 21, n. 4; 50), or to be direct\nconsequences of how the expression \u2018true\u2019 operates (cf.\nQuine 1970 [1986], Brandom 1988, and Field 1994a).\n\nIt is important to notice that even among deflationists the\nequivalence schema may be interpreted in different ways, and this is\none way to distinguish different versions of deflationism from one\nanother. One question about (ES) concerns the issue of what instances\nof the schema are assumed to be about (equivalently: to what the names\nin instances of (ES) are assumed to refer). According to one view, the\ninstances of this schema are about sentences, where a name for a\nsentence can be formulated simply by putting quotation marks around\nit. In other words, for those who hold what might be called a\nsententialist version of deflationism, the equivalence schema\nhas instances like (1):\n\n(1)\n\u2018Brutus killed Caesar\u2019 is true if, and only if, Brutus\nkilled Caesar.\n\n\nTo make this explicit, we might say that, according to sententialist\ndeflationism, the equivalence schema is:\n\n(ES-sent)\nThe sentence \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is true if, and only if,\n\\(p\\).\n\n\nNotice that in this schema, the angle-brackets of (ES) have been\nreplaced by quotation marks.\n\nAccording to those who hold what might be called a\npropositionalist version of deflationism, by contrast,\ninstances of the equivalence schema are about propositions, where\nnames of propositions are, or can be taken to be, expressions of the\nform \u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019, where\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is filled in with a declarative sentence. For the\npropositionalist, in other words, instances of the equivalence schema\nare properly interpreted not as being about sentences but instead as\nbeing about propositions, i.e., as biconditionals like (2) rather than\n(1):\n\n(2)\nThe proposition that Brutus killed Caesar is true if, and only if,\nBrutus killed Caesar.\n\n\nTo make this explicit, we might say that, according to\npropositionalist deflationism, the equivalence schema is:\n\n(ES-prop)\nThe proposition that \\(p\\) is true if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n\n\nInterpreting the equivalence schema as (ES-sent) rather than as\n(ES-prop), or vice versa, thus yields different versions of\ndeflationism, sententialist and propositionalist versions,\nrespectively.\n\nAnother aspect that different readings of (ES) can vary across\nconcerns the nature of the equivalence that its instances assert. On\none view, the right-hand side and the left-hand side of such instances\nare synonymous or analytically equivalent. Thus, for sententialists\nwho endorse this level of equivalence, (1) asserts that,\n\u201c\u2018Brutus killed Caesar\u2019 is true\u201d means just\nwhat \u2018Brutus killed Caesar\u2019 means; while for\npropositionalists who endorse analytic equivalence, (2) asserts that\n\u2018the proposition that Brutus killed Caesar is true\u2019 means\nthe same as \u2018Brutus killed Caesar\u2019. A second view is that\nthe right-hand and left-hand sides of claims such as (1) and (2) are\nnot synonymous but are nonetheless necessarily equivalent; this view\nmaintains that the two sides of each equivalence stand or fall\ntogether in every possible world, despite having different meanings.\nAnd a third possible view is that claims such as (1) and (2) assert\nonly a material equivalence; this view interprets the \u2018if and\nonly if\u2019 in both (1) and (2) as simply the biconditional of\nclassical logic.\n\nThis tripartite distinction between analytic, necessary, and material\nequivalence, when combined with the distinction between sententialism\nand propositionalism, yields six different possible (although not\nexhaustive) readings of the instances of (ES):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSentential\nPropositional  \n\n\nAnalytic\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) \n\nNecessary\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\) \n\nMaterial\n\\(\\mathbf{E}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{F}\\)  \n\n\nWhile different versions of deflationism can be correlated to some\nextent with different positions in this chart, some chart positions\nhave also been occupied by more than one version of deflationism. The\nlabels \u2018redundancy theory\u2019, \u2018disappearance\ntheory\u2019 and \u2018no-truth theory\u2019 have been used to\napply to analytic versions of deflationism: positions \\(\\mathbf{A}\\)\nor \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). But there is a sense in which position\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is also occupied by versions of what is called\n\u201cdisquotationalism\u201d (although the most prominent\ndisquotationalists tend to be leary of the notions of analyticity or\nsynonymy), and what is called \u201cprosententialism\u201d also\nposits an equivalence of what is said with the left- and right-hand\nsides of the instances of (ES). The latter version of deflationism,\nhowever, does this without making the left-hand sides about sentences\nnamed via quotation or about propositions understood as abstract\nentities. No deflationist has offered an account occupying position\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\), \\(\\mathbf{E}\\), or \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) (although the\nexplicit inspiration some disquotationalists have found in\nTarski\u2019s work and his deployment of material equivalence might\nmisleadingly suggest position \\(\\mathbf{E})\\). Paul Horwich (1998a)\nuses the label \u2018minimalism\u2019 for a version of\npropositionalist deflationism that takes the instances of (ES-prop) to\ninvolve a necessary equivalence, thereby occupying position\n\\(\\mathbf{D}\\). To a large extent, philosophers prefer one or another\n(or none) of the positions in the chart on the basis of their views\nfrom other parts of philosophy, typically their views about the\nphilosophy of language and metaphysics.\n1.2 The Property of Truth\n\nThe second theme we will discuss focuses on the fact that when we say,\nfor example, that the proposition that Brutus killed Caesar is true,\nwe seem to be attributing a property to that proposition, namely, the\nproperty of being true. Deflationists are typically wary of that\nclaim, insisting either that there is no property of being true at\nall, or, if there is one, it is of a certain kind, often called\n\u201cthin\u201d or \u201cinsubstantial\u201d.\n\nThe suggestion that there is no truth property at all is advanced by\nsome philosophers in the deflationary camp; we will look at some\nexamples below. What makes this position difficult to sustain is that\n\u2018is true\u2019 is grammatically speaking a predicate much like\n\u2018is metal\u2019. If one assumes that grammatical predicates\nsuch as \u2018is metal\u2019 express properties, then, prima\nfacie, the same would seem to go for \u2018is true.\u2019 This\npoint is not decisive, however. For one thing, it might be possible to\ndistinguish the grammatical form of claims containing \u2018is\ntrue\u2019 from their logical form; at the level of logical form, it\nmight be, as prosententialists maintain, that \u2018is true\u2019 is\nnot a predicate. For another, nominalists about properties\nhave developed ways of thinking about grammatical predicates according\nto which these expressions don\u2019t express properties at all. A\ndeflationist might appeal, perhaps selectively, to such proposals, in\norder to say that \u2018is true\u2019, while a predicate, does not\nexpress a property.\n\nWhatever the ultimate fate of these attempts to say that there is no\nproperty of truth may be, a suggestion among certain deflationists has\nbeen to concede that there is a truth property but to deny it is a\nproperty of a certain kind; in particular to deny that it is (as we\nwill say) a substantive property.\n\nTo illustrate the general idea, consider (3) and (4):\n\n(3)\nCaracas is the capital of Venezuela.\n\n\n(4)\nThe earth revolves around the sun.\n\n\nDo the propositions that these sentences express share a property of\nbeing true? Well, in one intuitive sense they do: Since they both are\ntrue, we might infer that they both have the property of being true.\nFrom this point of view, there is a truth property: It is simply the\nproperty that all true propositions have.\n\nOn the other hand, when we say that two things share a property of\nFness, we often mean more than simply that they are both\n\\(F\\). We often mean that two things that are \\(F\\) have some\nunderlying nature in common, for example, that there is a common\nexplanation as to why they are both \\(F\\). It is in this second claim\nthat deflationists have in mind when they say that truth is not a\nsubstantive property. Thus, in the case of our example, what, if\nanything, explains the truth of (3) is that Caracas is the capital of\nVenezuela, and what explains this is the political history of\nVenezuela. On the other hand, what, if anything, explains the truth of\n(4) is that the earth revolves around the sun, and what explains this\nis the physical nature of the solar system. The physical nature of the\nsolar system, however, has nothing to do with the political history of\nVenezuela (or if it does, the connections are completely accidental!)\nand to that extent there is no shared explanation as to why (3) and\n(4) are both true. Therefore, in this substantive sense, they have no\nproperty in common.\n\nIt will help to bring out the contrast being invoked here if we\nconsider two properties distinct from a supposed property of being\ntrue: the property of being a game and the property of being a mammal.\nConsider the games of chess and catch. Do both of these have the\nproperty of being a game? Well, in one sense, they do: they are both\ngames that people can play. On the other hand, however, there is no\ncommon explanation as to why each counts as a game (cf. Wittgenstein\n1953, \u00a766). We might then say that being a game is not a\nsubstantive property and mean just this. But now compare the property\nof being a mammal. If two things are mammals, they have the property\nof being a mammal, but in addition there is some common explanation as\nto why they are both mammals \u2013 both are descended from the same\nfamily of creatures, say. According to one development of\ndeflationism, the property of being true is more like the property of\nbeing a game than it is like the property of being a mammal.\n\nThe comparisons between being true, being a game, and being a mammal\nare suggestive, but they still do not nail down exactly what it means\nto say that truth is not a substantive property. The contemporary\nliterature on deflationism contains several different approaches to\nthe idea. One such approach, which we will consider in detail in\nSection 4.1, involves denying that truth plays an explanatory role.\nAnother approach, pursuing an analogy between being true and existing,\ndescribes truth as a \u201clogical property\u201d (for example,\nField 1992, 322; Horwich 1998a, 37; K\u00fcnne 2003, 91). A further\napproach appeals to\n David Lewis\u2019s\n (1983, 1986) view that, while every set of entities underwrites a\nproperty, there is a distinction between sparse, or\nnatural, properties and more motley or disjointed\nabundant properties. On this approach, a deflationist might\nsay that there is an abundant property of being true rather than a\nsparse one (cf. Edwards 2013, Asay 2014, Kukla and Winsberg 2015, and\nArmour-Garb forthcoming). A different metaphysical idea may be to\nappeal to the contemporary discussion of grounding and the distinction\nbetween groundable and ungroundable properties. In this context, a\ngroundable property is one that is capable of being grounded in some\nother property, whether or not it is in fact grounded; an ungroundable\nproperty is a property that is not groundable (see Dasgupta 2015, 2016\nand Rabin 2020). From this point of view, a deflationist might say\nthat being true is an ungroundable property. Hence it is unlike\nordinary, sparse/natural properties, such as being iron, which are\nboth capable of being grounded and are grounded, and it is also unlike\nfundamental physical properties, such as being a lepton, which are\ncapable of being grounded (in some other possible world) but are not\n(actually) grounded. We will not try to decide here which of these\ndifferent views of properties is correct but simply note that\ndeflationists who want to claim that there is a truth property, just\nnot a substantive one, have options for explaining what this\nmeans.\n1.3 The Utility of the Concept of Truth\n\nIn light of the two central ideas discussed so far \u2013 the idea\nthat the equivalence schema is exhaustive of the notion of truth and\nthe idea that there is no substantive truth property \u2013 you might\nwonder why we have a concept of truth in the first place. After all,\ncontrast this question with the explanation of why we have the concept\nof mammals. A natural suggestion is that it allows us to think and\ntalk about mammals and to develop theories of them. For deflationism,\nhowever, as we have just seen, being true is completely different from\nbeing a mammal; why then do we have a concept of truth? (An analogous\nquestion might be asked about the word \u2018true\u2019, i.e., why\nwe have the word \u2018true\u2019 and related words in our language\nat all. In the following discussion we will not discriminate between\nquestions about the concept of truth and questions about the word\n\u2018true\u2019 and will move back and forth between them.)\n\nThe question of why we have the concept of truth allows us to\nintroduce a third central theme in deflationism, which is an emphasis\nnot merely on the property of truth but on the concept of truth, or,\nequivalently for present purposes, on the word \u2018true\u2019 (cf.\nLeeds 1978). Far from supposing that there is no point having the\nconcept of truth, deflationists are usually at pains to point out that\nanyone who has the concept of truth is in possession of a very useful\nconcept indeed; in particular, anyone who has this concept is in a\nposition to express generalizations that would otherwise require\nnon-standard logical devices, such as sentential variables and\nquantifiers for them.\n\nSuppose, for example, that Jones for whatever reason decides that\nSmith is an infallible guide to the nature of reality. We might then\nsay that Jones believes everything that Smith says. To say this much,\nhowever, is not to capture the content of Jones\u2019s belief. In\norder to do that we need some way of generalizing on the embedded\nsentence positions in a claim like:\n\n(5)\nIf Smith says that birds are dinosaurs, then birds are\ndinosaurs.\n\n\nTo generalize on the relationship indicated in (5), beyond just what\nSmith says about birds to anything she might say, what we want to do\nis generalize on the embedded occurrences of \u2018birds are\ndinosaurs\u2019. So, we need a (declarative) sentential variable,\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019, and a universal quantifier governing it. What we\nwant is a way of capturing something along the lines of\n\n(6)\nFor all \\(p\\), if Smith says that \\(p\\), then \\(p.\\)\n\n\nThe problem is that we cannot formulate this in English with our most\nfamiliar way of generalizing because the \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 in the\nconsequent is in a sentence-in-use position, rather than mentioned or\nnominalized context (as it is in the antecedent), meaning that this\nformal variable cannot be replaced with a familiar English\nobject-variable expression, e.g., \u2018it\u2019.\n\nThis is where the concept of truth comes in. What we do in order to\ngeneralize in the way under consideration is employ the truth\npredicate with an object variable to produce the sentence,\n\n(7)\nFor all \\(x\\), if what Smith said \\(= x\\), then \\(x\\) is\ntrue.\n\n\nRe-rendering the quasi-formal (7) into natural language yields,\n\n(8)\nEverything is such that, if it is what Smith said, then it is\ntrue.\n\n\nOr, to put the same thing more colloquially:\n\n(9)\nEverything Smith says is true.\n\n\nThe equivalence schema (ES-prop) allows us to use (7) (and therefore\n(9)) to express what it would otherwise require the unstatable (6) to\nexpress. For, on the basis of the schema, there is always an\nequivalence between whatever goes in for a sentence-in-use occurrence\nof the variable \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 and a context in which that\nfilling of the sentential variable is nominalized. This reveals how\nthe truth predicate can be used to provide a surrogate for sentential\nvariables, simulating this non-standard logical device while still\ndeploying the standard object variables already available in ordinary\nlanguage (\u2018it\u2019) and the usual object quantifiers\n(\u2018everything\u2019) that govern them.\n\nThis is how the use of the truth predicate in (9) gives us the content\nof Jones\u2019s belief. And the important point for deflationists is\nthat we could not have stated the content of this belief unless we had\nthe concept of truth (the expression \u2018true\u2019). In fact, for\nmost deflationists, it is this feature of the concept of truth \u2013\nits role in the formation of these sorts of generalizations \u2013\nthat explains why we have a concept of truth at all. This is, as it is\noften put, the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the concept of\ntruth (cf. Field 1994a and Horwich 1998a).\n2. History of Deflationism\n\nAccording to Michael Dummett (1959 [1978]), deflationism originates\nwith\n Gottlob Frege,\n as expressed in this famous quote by the latter:\n\nIt is \u2026 worthy of notice that the sentence \u2018I smell the\nscent of violets\u2019 has just the same content as the sentence\n\u2018It is true that I smell the scent of violets\u2019. So it\nseems, then, that nothing is added to the thought by my ascribing to\nit the property of truth. (Frege 1918, 6)\n\n\nThis passage suggests that Frege embraces a deflationary view in\nposition \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (in the chart above), namely, an analytic\npropositionalist version of deflationism. But this interpretation of\nhis view is not so clear. As Scott Soames (1999, 21ff) points out,\nFrege (ibid.) distinguishes what we will call \u201copaque\u201d\ntruth ascriptions, like \u2018My conjecture is true\u2019, from\ntransparent truth-ascriptions, like the one mentioned in the quote\nfrom Frege. Unlike with transparent cases, in opaque instances, one\ncannot simply strip \u2018is true\u2019 away and obtain an\nequivalent sentence, since the result is not even a sentence at\nall.\n\nFrank Ramsey\n is the first philosopher to have suggested a position like\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (although he does not really accept propositions as\nabstract entities (see Ramsey 1927 (34\u20135) and 1929 (7)), despite\nsometimes talking in terms of propositions):\n\nTruth and falsity are ascribed primarily to propositions. The\nproposition to which they are ascribed may be either explicitly given\nor described. Suppose first that it is explicitly given; then it is\nevident that \u2018It is true that Caesar was murdered\u2019 means\nno more than that Caesar was murdered, and \u2018It is false that\nCaesar was murdered\u2019 means no more than Caesar was not murdered.\n\u2026. In the second case in which the proposition is described and\nnot given explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem, for we get\nstatements from which we cannot in ordinary language eliminate the\nwords \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019. Thus if I say\n\u2018He is always right\u2019, I mean that the propositions he\nasserts are always true, and there does not seem to be any way of\nexpressing this without using the word \u2018true\u2019. But suppose\nwe put it thus \u2018For all \\(p\\), if he asserts \\(p\\), \\(p\\) is\ntrue\u2019, then we see that the propositional function \\(p\\) is true\nis simply the same as \\(p\\), as e.g. its value \u2018Caesar was\nmurdered is true\u2019 is the same as \u2018Caesar was\nmurdered\u2019. (Ramsey 1927, 38\u20139)\n\n\nOn Ramsey\u2019s redundancy theory (as it is often called), the truth\noperator, \u2018it is true that\u2019 adds no content when prefixed\nto a sentence, meaning that in the instances of what we can think of\nas the truth-operator version of (ES),\n\n(ES-op)\nIt is true that \\(p\\) iff \\(p\\),\n\n\nthe left- and right-hand sides are meaning-equivalent. But Ramsey\nextends his redundancy theory beyond just the transparent instances of\ntruth-talk, maintaining that the truth predicate is, in principle,\neliminable even in opaque ascriptions of the form \u2018\\(B\\) is\ntrue\u2019 (which he (1929, 15, n. 7) explains in terms of sentential\nvariables via a formula along the lines of \u2018\\(\\exists\np\\) (\\(p \\amp B\\) is a belief that \\(p\\))\u2019) and in explicitly\nquantificational instances, like \u2018Everything Einstein said is\ntrue\u2019 (explained as above). As the above quote illustrates,\nRamsey recognizes that in truth ascriptions like these the truth\npredicate fills a grammatical need, which keeps us from eliminating it\naltogether, but he held that even in these cases it contributes no\ncontent to anything said using it.\n\nA.J. Ayer\n endorses a view similar to Ramsey\u2019s. The following quote shows\nthat he embraces a meaning equivalence between the two sides of the\ninstances of both the sentential (position \\(\\mathbf{A})\\) and\nsomething like (since, despite his use of the expression\n\u2018proposition\u2019 to mean sentence, he also considers\ninstances of truth-talk involving the prefix \u2018it is true\nthat\u2019, which could be read as employing\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses) the propositional (position\n\\(\\mathbf{B})\\) version of (ES).\n\n[I]t is evident that a sentence of the form \u201c\\(p\\) is\ntrue\u201d or \u201cit is true that \\(p\\)\u201d the reference to\ntruth never adds anything to the sense. If I say that it is true that\nShakespeare wrote Hamlet, or that the proposition\n\u201cShakespeare wrote Hamlet\u201d is true, I am saying\nno more than that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet. Similarly, if I\nsay that it is false that Shakespeare wrote the Iliad, I am\nsaying no more than that Shakespeare did not write the Iliad.\nAnd this shows that the words \u2018true\u2019 and\n\u2018false\u2019 are not used to stand for anything, but function\nin the sentence merely as assertion and negation signs. That is to\nsay, truth and falsehood are not genuine concepts. Consequently, there\ncan be no logical problem concerning the nature of truth. (Ayer 1935,\n28. Cf. Ayer 1936 [1952, 89])\n\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein,\n under Ramsey\u2019s influence, makes claims with strong affinities\nto deflationism in his later work. We can see a suggestion of an\nendorsement of deflationary positions \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{B}\\)\nin his (1953, \u00a7136) statement that \u201c\\(p\\) is true \\(=\np\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(p\\) is false = not-\\(p\\)\u201d, indicating\nthat ascribing truth (or falsity) to a statement just amounts to\nasserting that very proposition (or its negation). Wittgenstein also\nexpresses this kind of view in manuscripts from the 1930s, where he\nclaims, \u201cWhat he says is true = Things are as he says\u201d and\n\u201c[t]he word \u2018true\u2019 is used in contexts such as\n\u2018What he says is true\u2019, but that says the same thing as\n\u2018He says \\(\\ldquo p\\rdquo,\\) and \\(p\\) is the\ncase\u2019\u201d. (Wittgenstein 1934 [1974, 123]) and 1937 [2005,\n61]), respectively)\n\nPeter Strawson\u2019s\n views on truth emerge most fully in his 1950 debate with\n J.L. Austin.\n In keeping with deflationary position \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), Strawson (1950,\n145\u20137) maintains that an utterance of \u2018It is true that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 just makes the same statement as an utterance of\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019. However, in Strawson 1949 and 1950, he further\nendorses a performative view, according to which an utterance\nof a sentence like \u2018That is true\u2019 mainly functions to do\nsomething beyond mere re-assertion. This represents a shift\nto an account of what the expression \u2018true\u2019 does,\nfrom traditional accounts of what truth is, or even accounts of what\n\u2018true\u2019 means.\n\nAnother figure briefly mentioned above who looms large in the\ndevelopment of deflationism is\n Alfred Tarski,\n with his (1935 [1956] and 1944) identification of a precise criterion\nof adequacy for any formal definition of truth: its implying all of\nthe instances of what is sometimes called \u201cConvention (T)\u201d\nor \u201cthe (T)-schema\u201d,\n\n(T)\n\\(X\\) is true if, and only if, \\(p\\).\n\n\nTo explain this schema a bit more precisely, in its instances the\n\u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 gets replaced by a name of a sentence from the\nobject-language for which the truth predicate is being\ndefined, and the \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 gets replaced by a sentence that\nis a translation of that sentence into the meta-language in which the\ntruth predicate is being defined. For Tarski, the \u2018if and only\nif\u2019 deployed in any instance of (T) expresses just a material\nequivalence, putting his view at position \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) in the chart\nfrom Section 1.1. Although this means that Tarski is not a\ndeflationist himself (cf. Field 1994a, Ketland 1999, and Patterson\n2012), there is no denying the influence that his work and its\npromotion of the (T)-schema have had on deflationism. Indeed, some\nearly deflationists, such as\n W.V.O. Quine\n and Stephen Leeds, are quite explicit about taking inspiration from\nTarski\u2019s work in developing their \u201cdisquotational\u201d\nviews, as is Horwich in his initial discussion of deflationism. Even\ncritics of deflationism have linked it with Tarski: Hilary Putnam\n(1983b, 1985) identifies deflationists as theorists who \u201crefer\nto the work of Alfred Tarski and to the semantical conception of\ntruth\u201d and who take Tarski\u2019s work \u201cas a solution to\nthe philosophical problem of truth\u201d.\n\nThe first fully developed deflationary view is the one that Quine\n(1970 [1986, 10\u20132]) presents. Given his skepticism about the\nexistence of propositions, Quine takes sentences to be the primary\nentities to which \u2018is true\u2019 may be applied, making the\ninstances of (ES-sent) the equivalences that he accepts. He defines a\ncategory of sentence that he dubs \u201ceternal\u201d, viz.,\nsentence types that have all their indexical/contextual factors\nspecified, the tokens of which always have the same truth-values. It\nis for these sentences that Quine offers his disquotational view. As\nhe (ibid., 12) puts it,\n\n\nThis cancellatory force of the truth predicate is explicit in\nTarski\u2019s paradigm:\n\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 is true if and only if snow is white.\n\n\nQuotation marks make all the difference between talking about words\nand talking about snow. The quotation is a name of a sentence that\ncontains the name, namely \u2018snow\u2019, of snow. By calling the\nsentence true, we call snow white. The truth predicate is a device of\ndisquotation.\n\n\nAs this quote suggests, Quine sees Tarski\u2019s formal work on\ndefining truth predicates for formalized languages and his criterion\nof adequacy for doing so as underwriting a disquotational analysis of\nthe truth predicate. This makes Quine\u2019s view a different kind of\nposition-\\(\\mathbf{A}\\) account, since he takes the left-hand side of\neach instance of (ES-sent) to be, as we will put it (since Quine\nrejects the whole idea of meaning and meaning equivalence), something\nlike a mere syntactic variant of the right-hand side. This also means\nthat Quine\u2019s version of deflationism departs from inflationism\nby rejecting the latter\u2019s presupposition that truth predicates\nfunction to describe the entities they get applied to, the\nway that other predicates, such as \u2018is metal\u2019, do.\n\nQuine also emphasizes the importance of the truth predicate\u2019s\nrole as a means for expressing the kinds of otherwise inexpressible\ngeneralizations discussed in Section 1.3. As he (1992, 80\u20131)\nexplains it,\n\nThe truth predicate proves invaluable when we want to generalize along\na dimension that cannot be swept out by a general term \u2026 The\nharder sort of generalization is illustrated by generalization on the\nclause \u2018time flies\u2019 in \u2018If time flies then time\nflies\u2019\u2026. We could not generalize as in \u2018All men are\nmortal\u2019 because \u2018time flies\u2019 is not, like\n\u2018Socrates\u2019, a name of one of a range of objects (men) over\nwhich to generalize. We cleared this obstacle by semantic\nascent: by ascending to a level where there were indeed objects\nover which to generalize, namely linguistic objects, sentences.\n\n\nSo, if we want to generalize on embedded sentence-positions within\nsome sentences, \u201cwe ascend to talk of truth and sentences\u201d\n(Quine 1970 [1986, 11]). This maneuver allows us to \u201caffirm some\ninfinite lot of sentences that we can demarcate only by talking about\nthe sentences\u201d (ibid., 12).\n\nLeeds (1978) (following Quine) makes it clear how the truth predicate\nis crucial for extending the expressive power of a language, despite\nthe triviality that disquotationalism suggests for the transparent\ninstances of truth-talk. He (ibid., 121) emphasizes the logical role\nof the truth predicate in the expression of certain kinds of\ngeneralizations that would otherwise be inexpressible in natural\nlanguage. Leeds, like Quine, notes that a central utility of the truth\npredicate, in virtue of its yielding every instance of (ES-sent), is\nthe simulation of quantification into sentence-positions. But, unlike\nQuine, Leeds glosses this logical role in terms of expressing\npotentially infinite conjunctions (for universal generalization) or\npotentially infinite disjunctions (for existential generalization).\nThe truth predicate allows us to use the ordinary devices of\nfirst-order logic in ways that provide surrogates for the non-standard\nlogical devices this would otherwise require. Leeds is also clear\nabout accepting the consequences of deflationism, that is, of taking\nthe logically expressive role of the truth predicate to exhaust its\nfunction. In particular, he points out that there is no need to think\nthat truth plays any sort of explanatory role. We will return\nto this point in Section 4.1.\n\nDorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and Nuel Belnap (1975) develop a\ndifferent variety of deflationism that they call a\n\u201cprosentential theory\u201d. This theory descends principally\nfrom Ramsey\u2019s views. In fact, Ramsey (1929, 10) made what is\nprobably the earliest use of the term \u2018pro-sentence\u2019 in\nhis account of the purpose of truth-talk. Prosentences are explained\nas the sentence-level analog of pronouns. As in the case of pronouns,\nprosentences inherit their content anaphorically from other linguistic\nitems, in this case from some sentence typically called the\nprosentence\u2019s \u201canaphoric antecedent\u201d (although it\nneed not actually occur before the prosentence). As Grover, et\nal. develop this idea, this content inheritance can happen in two\nways. The most basic one is called \u201clazy\u201d anaphora. Here\nthe prosentence could simply be replaced with a repetition of its\nantecedent, as in the sort of case that Strawson emphasized, where one\nsays \u201cThat is true\u201d after someone else has made an\nassertion. According to Grover, et al., this instance of\ntruth-talk is a prosentence that inherits its content anaphorically\nfrom the other speaker\u2019s utterance, so that the two speakers\nassert the same thing. As a result, Grover, et al. would take\nthe instances of (ES) to express meaning equivalences, but since they\n(ibid., 113\u20135) do not take the instances of truth-talk on the\nleft-hand sides of these equivalences to say anything about\nany named entities, they would not read (ES) as either (ES-sent) or\n(ES-prop) on their standard interpretations. So, while their\nprosententialism is similar to views in position \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) or in\nposition \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) in the chart above, it is also somewhat\ndifferent from both.\n\nGrover, et al.\u2019s project is to develop the theory\n\u201cthat \u2018true\u2019 can be thought of always as part of a\nprosentence\u201d (ibid., 83). They explain that \u2018it is\ntrue\u2019 and \u2018that is true\u2019 are generally available\nprosentences that can go into any sentence-position. They consider\nthese expressions to be \u201catomic\u201d in the sense of not being\nsusceptible to a subject-predicate analysis giving the\n\u2018that\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019 separate references (ibid.,\n91). Both of these prosentences can function in the \u201clazy\u201d\nway, and Grover, et al. claim (ibid., 91\u20132, 114) that\n\u2018it is true\u2019 can also operate as a quantificational\nprosentence (i.e., a sentential variable), for example, in a\nre-rendering of a sentence like,\n\n(9)\nEverything Smith says is true.\n\n\nin terms of a \u201clong-form\u201d equivalent claim, such as\n\n(8\u2032)\nEverything is such that, if Smith says that it is true, then it is\ntrue.\n\n\nOne immediate concern that this version of prosententialism faces\npertains to what one might call the \u201cparaphrastic\ngymnastics\u201d that it requires. For example, a sentence like\n\u2018It is true that humans are causing climate change\u2019 is\nsaid to have for its underlying logical form the same form as\n\u2018Humans are causing climate change. That is true\u2019 (ibid.,\n94). As a result, when one utters an instance of truth-talk of the\nform \u2018It is true that \\(p\\)\u2019, one states the content of\nthe sentence that goes in for \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 twice. In\ncases of quotation, like \u201c\u2018Birds are dinosaurs\u2019 is\ntrue\u201d, Grover, et al. offer the following rendering,\n\u2018Consider: Birds are dinosaurs. That is true\u2019 (ibid.,\n103). But taking this as the underlying form of quotational instance\nof truth-talk requires rejecting the standard view that putting\nquotation marks around linguistic items forms names of those items.\nThese issues raise concerns regarding the adequacy of this version of\nprosententialism.\n3. The Varieties of Contemporary Deflationism\n\nIn this section, we explain the details of three prominent,\ncontemporary accounts and indicate some concerns peculiar to each.\n3.1 Minimalism\n\nMinimalism is the version of deflationism that diverges the least from\ninflationism because it accepts many of the standard inflationary\npresuppositions, including that \u2018is true\u2019 is a predicate\nused to describe entities as having (or lacking) a truth property.\nWhat makes minimalism a version of deflationism is its denial of\ninflationism\u2019s final assumption, namely, that the property\nexpressed by the truth predicate has a substantive nature. Drawing\ninspiration from Leeds (1978), Horwich (1982, 182) actually coins the\nterm \u2018deflationism\u2019 while describing \u201cthe\ndeflationary redundancy theory which denies the existence of surplus\nmeaning and contends that Tarski\u2019s schema [\u201d\\(p\\)\u201c\nis true iff \\(p\\)] is quite sufficient to capture the concept.\u201d\nMinimalism, Horwich\u2019s mature deflationary position (1998a [First\nEdition, 1990]), adds to this earlier view. In particular, Horwich\n(ibid., 37, 125, 142) comes to embrace the idea that \u2018is\ntrue\u2019 does express a property, but it is merely a \u201clogical\nproperty\u201d (cf. Field 1992), rather than any substantive or\nnaturalistic property of truth with an analyzable underlying nature\n(Horwich 1998a, 2, 38, 120\u20131).\n\nOn the basis of natural language considerations, Horwich (ibid.,\n2\u20133, 39\u201340) holds that propositions are what the alethic\nlocutions describe directly. Any other entities that we can properly\ncall true are so only derivatively, on the basis of having some\nrelation to true propositions (ibid., 100\u20131 and Horwich 1998b,\n82\u20135). This seems to position Horwich well with respect to\nexplaining the instances of truth-talk that cause problems for Quine\nand Leeds, e.g., those about beliefs and theories. Regarding truth\napplied directly to propositions, however, Horwich (1998a, 2\u20133)\nstill explicitly endorses the thesis that Leeds emphasizes about the\nutility of the truth predicate (and, Horwich adds, the concept it\nexpresses), namely, that it \u201cexists solely for the sake of a\ncertain logical need\u201d. While Horwich (ibid., 138\u20139) goes\nso far as to claim that the concept of truth has a\n\u201cnon-descriptive\u201d function, he does not follow Quine and\nLeeds all the way to their rejection of the assumption that the\nalethic predicates function to describe truth-bearers. Rather, his\n(ibid., 31\u20133, 37) point of agreement with them is that the\nmain function of the truth predicate is its role in providing\na means for generalizing on embedded sentence positions, rather than\nsome role in the indication of specifically truth-involving states of\naffairs. Even so, Horwich (ibid., 38\u201340) still contends that the\ninstances of truth-talk do describe propositions, in the sense that\nthey make statements about them, and they do so by\nattributing a property to those propositions.\n\nThe version of (ES) that Horwich (1998a, 6) makes the basis of his\ntheory is what he also calls \u201cthe equivalence schema\u201d,\n\n(E)\nIt is true that \\(p\\) if and only if \\(p\\).\n\n\nSince he takes truth-talk to involve describing propositions with a\npredicate, Horwich considers \u2018it is true that \\(p\\)\u2019 to be\njust a trivial variant of \u2018The proposition that \\(p\\) is\ntrue\u2019, meaning that his (E) is a version of (ES-prop) rather\nthan of Ramsey\u2019s (ES-op). He also employs the notation\n\u2018\\(\\langle p\\rangle\\)\u2019 as shorthand specifically for\n\u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019, generating a further\nrendering of his equivalence schema (ibid., 10) that we can clearly\nrecognize as a version of (ES-prop), namely\n\n(E)\n\\(\\langle p\\rangle\\) is true iff \\(p\\).\n\n\nHorwich considers the instances of (E) to constitute the axioms of\nboth an account of the property of truth and an account of the concept\nof truth, i.e., what is meant by the word \u2018true\u2019 (ibid.,\n136). According to minimalism, the instances of (E) are explanatorily\nfundamental, which Horwich suggests is a reason for taking them to be\nnecessary (ibid., 21, n. 4). This, combined with his view that the\nequivalence schema applies to propositions, places his minimalism in\nposition \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) in the chart given in Section 1.1. The\ninstances of (ES-prop) are thus explanatory of the functioning of the\ntruth predicate (of its role as a de-nominalizer of\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses (ibid., 5)), rather than being explained by\nthat functioning (as the analogous equivalences are for both\ndisquotationalism and prosententialism). Moreover, Horwich (ibid., 50,\n138) claims that they are also conceptually basic and a\npriori. He (ibid., 27\u201330, 33, 112) denies that truth admits\nof any sort of explicit definition or reductive analysis in terms of\nother concepts, such as reference or predicate-satisfaction. In fact,\nHorwich (ibid., 10\u20131, 111\u20132, 115\u20136) holds that these\nother semantic notions should both be given their own, infinitely\naxiomatized, minimalist accounts, which would then clarify the\nnon-reductive nature of the intuitive connections between them and the\nnotion of truth.\n\nHorwich (ibid., 27\u201330) maintains that the infinite axiomatic\nnature of minimalism is unavoidable. He (ibid., 25) rejects the\npossibility of a finite formulation of minimalism via the use\nof\n substitutional quantification.\n On the usual understanding of this non-standard type of\nquantification, the quantifiers govern variables that serve to mark\nplaces in linguistic strings, indicating that either all or some of\nthe elements of an associated substitution class of linguistic items\nof a particular category can be substituted in for the variables.\nSince it is possible for the variables so governed to take sentences\nas their substitution items, this allows for a type of quantification\ngoverning sentence positions in complex sentences. Using this sort of\nsentential substitutional quantification, the thought is, one can\nformulate a finite general principle that expresses Horwich\u2019s\naccount of truth as follows:\n\n(GT)\n\\(\\forall x\\, (x\\) is true iff \\(\\Sigma p (x = \\langle p\\rangle\n\\amp p)),\\)\n\n\nwhere \u2018\\(\\Sigma\\)\u2019 is the existential substitutional\nquantifier. (GT) is formally equivalent to the formulation that Marian\nDavid (1994, 100) presents as disquotationalism\u2019s definition of\n\u2018true sentence\u2019, here formulated for propositions instead.\nHorwich\u2019s main reason for rejecting the proposed finite\nformulation of minimalism, (GT), is that an account of substitutional\nquantifiers seems (contra David 1994, 98\u20139) to require an appeal\nto truth (since the quantifiers are explained as expressing that at\nleast one or that every item in the associated substitution class\nyields a true sentence when substituted in for the governed\nvariables), generating circularity concerns (Horwich 1998a,\n25\u20136).\n\nMoreover, on Horwich\u2019s (ibid., 4, n. 1; Cf. 25, 32\u20133)\nunderstanding, the point of the truth predicate is to provide a\nsurrogate for substitutional quantification and sentence-variables in\nnatural language, so as \u201cto achieve the effect of generalizing\nsubstitutionally over sentences \u2026 but by means of ordinary\n[quantifiers and] variables (i.e., pronouns), which range over\nobjects\u201d (italics original). Horwich maintains that the\ninfinite \u201clist-like\u201d nature of minimalism poses no problem\nfor the view\u2019s adequacy with respect to explaining all of our\nuses of the truth predicate, and the bulk of Horwich 1998a attempts to\nestablish just that. However, Anil Gupta (1993a, 365) has pointed out\nthat minimalism\u2019s infinite axiomatization in terms of the\ninstances of (E) for every (non-paradox-inducing) proposition makes it\nmaximally ideologically complex, in virtue of involving every other\nconcept. (Moreover, the overtly \u201cfragmented\u201d nature of the\ntheory also makes it particularly vulnerable to the Generalization\nProblem that Gupta has raised, which we discuss in Section 4.5,\nbelow.)\n\nChristopher Hill (2002) attempts to deal with some of the problems\nthat Horwich\u2019s view faces, by presenting a view that he takes to\nbe a newer version of minimalism, replacing Horwich\u2019s\nequivalence schema with a universally quantified formula, employing a\nkind of substitutional quantification to provide a finite definition\nof \u2018true thought (proposition)\u2019. Hill\u2019s (ibid., 22)\nformulation of his account,\n\n(S)\nFor any object \\(x\\), \\(x\\) is true if and only if \\((\\Sigma p)((x\n=\\) the thought that \\(p)\\) and \\(p)\\),\n\n\nis formally similar to the formulation of minimalism in terms of (GT)\nthat Horwich rejects, but to avoid the circularity concerns driving\nthat rejection, Hill\u2019s (ibid., 18\u201322) idea is to offer\nintroduction and elimination rules in the style of Gerhard Gentzen\n(1935 [1969]) as a means for defining the substitutional quantifiers.\nHorwich (1998a, 26) rejects even this inference-rule sort of approach,\nbut he directs his critique against defining linguistic\nsubstitutional quantification this way. Hill takes his substitutional\nquantifiers to apply to thoughts (propositions) instead of sentences.\nBut serious concerns have been raised regarding the coherence of this\nnon-linguistic notion of substitutional quantification (cf. David\n2006, Gupta 2006b, Simmons 2006). As a result, it is unclear that\nHill\u2019s account is an improvement on Horwich\u2019s version of\nminimalism.\n3.2 Disquotationalism\n\nLike minimalism, disquotationalism agrees with inflationary accounts\nof truth that the alethic locutions function as predicates, at least\nlogically speaking. However, as we explained in discussing\nQuine\u2019s view in Section 2, disquotationalism diverges from\ninflationary views (and minimalism) at their shared assumption that\nthese (alethic) predicates serve to describe the entities\npicked out by the expressions with which they are combined,\nspecifically as having or lacking a certain property.\n\nAlthough Quine\u2019s disquotationalism is inspired by Tarski\u2019s\nrecursive method for defining a truth predicate, that method is not\nwhat Quine\u2019s view emphasizes. Field\u2019s contemporary\ndisquotationism further departs from that aspect of Tarski\u2019s\nwork by looking directly to the instances of the (T)-schema that the\nrecursive method must generate in order to satisfy Tarski\u2019s\ncriterion of material adequacy. Tarski himself (1944, 344\u20135)\nsuggests at one point that each instance of (T) could be considered a\n\u201cpartial definition\u201d of truth and considers (but\nultimately rejects; see Section 4.5) the thesis that a logical\nconjunction of all of these partial definitions amounts to a general\ndefinition of truth (for the language that the sentences belonged to).\nGeneralizing slightly from Tarski, we can call this alternative\napproach \u201c(T)-schema disquotationalism\u201d, in contrast with\nthe Tarski-inspired approach that David (1994, 110\u20131) calls\n\u201crecursive disquotationalism\u201d. Field (1987, 1994a)\ndevelops a version of (T)-schema disquotationalism that he calls\n\u201cpure disquotational truth\u201d, focusing specifically on the\ninstances of his preferred version of (ES), the \u201cdisquotational\nschema\u201d (Field 1994a, 258),\n\n(T[/ES-sent])\n\u201c\\(p\\)\u201d is true if and only if \\(p\\).\n\n\nSimilar to the \u201csingle principle\u201d formulation, (GT),\nrejected by Horwich (but endorsed by Hill), Field (ibid., 267) allows\nthat one could take a \u201cgeneralized\u201d version of\n(T/ES-sent), prefixed with a universal substitutional quantifier,\n\u2018\\(\\Pi\\)\u2019, as having axiomatic status, or one could\nincorporate schematic sentence variables directly into one\u2019s\ntheorizing language and reason directly with (T/ES-sent) as a schema\n(cf. ibid., 259). Either way, in setting out his version of\ndeflationism, Field (ibid., 250), in contrast with Horwich, does not\ntake the instances of his version of (ES) as fundamental but instead\nas following from the functioning of the truth predicate. On\nField\u2019s reading of (T/ES-sent), the use of the truth predicate\non the left-hand side of an instance does not add any cognitive\ncontent beyond that which the mentioned utterance has (for the\nspeaker) on its own when used (as on the right-hand-side of\n(T/ES-sent)). As a result, each instance of (T/ES-sent) \u201cholds\nof conceptual necessity, that is, by virtue of the cognitive\nequivalence of the left and right hand sides\u201d (ibid., 258). This\nplaces Field\u2019s deflationism also in position \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) in\nthe chart from Section 1.1.\n\nFollowing Leeds and Quine, Field (1999, 533\u20134) sees the central\nutility of a purely disquotational truth predicate to be providing for\nthe expression of certain \u201cfertile generalizations\u201d that\ncannot be made without using the truth predicate but which do not\nreally involve the notion of truth. Field (1994a, 264) notes that the\ntruth predicate plays \u201can important logical role: it allows us\nto formulate certain infinite conjunctions and disjunctions that\ncan\u2019t be formulated otherwise [n. 17: at least in a language\nthat does not contain substitutional quantifiers]\u201d.\n\nField\u2019s disquotationalism addresses some of the worries that\narose for earlier versions of this variety of deflationism, due to\ntheir connections with Tarski\u2019s method of defining truth\npredicates. It also explains how to apply a disquotational truth\npredicate to ambiguous and indexical utterances, thereby going beyond\nQuine\u2019s (1970 [1986]) insistence on taking eternal sentences as\nthe subjects of the instances of (ES-sent) (cf. Field 1994a,\n278\u201381). So, Field\u2019s view addresses some of the concerns\nthat David (1994, 130\u201366) raises for disquotationalism. However,\nan abiding concern about this variety of deflationism is that it is an\naccount of truth as applied specifically to sentences. This opens the\ndoor to a version of the complaint that Strawson (1950) makes against\nAustin\u2019s account of truth, that it is not one\u2019s act of\nstating [here: the sentence one utters] but what thereby gets stated\nthat is the target of a truth ascription. William Alston (1996, 14)\nmakes a similar point. While disquotationalists do not worry much\nabout this, this scope restriction might strike others as problematic\nbecause it raises questions about how we are to understand truth\napplied to beliefs or judgments, something that Hill (2002) worries\nabout. Field (1978) treats beliefs as mental states relating thinkers\nto sentences (of a language of thought). But David (1994, 172\u20137)\nraises worries for applying disquotationalism to beliefs, even in the\ncontext of an account like Field\u2019s. The view that we believe\nsentences remains highly controversial, but it is one that, it seems,\na Field-style disquotationalist must endorse. Similarly, such\ndisquotationalists must take scientific theories to consist of sets of\nsentences, in order for truth to be applicable to them. This too runs\nup against Strawson\u2019s complaint because it suggests that one\ncould not state the same theory in a different language. These sorts\nof concerns continue to press for disquotationalists.\n3.3 Prosententialism\n\nAs emerges from the discussion of Grover, et al. (1975) in\nSection 2, prosententialism is the form of deflationism that contrasts\nthe most with inflationism, rejecting even the latter\u2019s initial\nassumption that the alethic locutions function as predicates. Partly\nin response to the difficulties confronting Grover, et\nal.\u2019s prosentential account, Robert Brandom (1988 and 1994)\nhas developed a variation on their view with an important\nmodification. In place of taking the underlying logic of\n\u2018true\u2019 as having this expression occur only as a\nnon-separable component of the semantically atomic prosentential\nexpressions, \u2018that is true\u2019 and \u2018it is true\u2019,\nBrandom treats \u2018is true\u2019 as a separable\nprosentence-forming operator. \u201cIt applies to a\nterm that is a sentence nominalization or that refers to or picks out\na sentence tokening. It yields a prosentence that has that tokening as\nits anaphoric antecedent\u201d (Brandom 1994, 305). In this way,\nBrandom\u2019s account avoids most of the paraphrase concerns that\nGrover, et al.\u2019s prosententialism faces, while still\nmaintaining prosententialism\u2019s rejection of the contention that\nthe alethic locutions function predicatively. As a consequence of his\noperator approach, Brandom gives quantificational uses of prosentences\na slightly different analysis. He (re)expands instances of truth-talk\nlike the following,\n\n(9)\nEverything Smith says is true.\n\n\n(10)\nSomething Jones said is true.\n\n\n\u201cback\u201d into longer forms, such as\n\n(8*)\nFor anything one can say, if Smith says it, then it is true.\n\n\n(11)\nFor something one can say, Jones said it, and it is true.\n\n\nand explains only the second \u2018it\u2019 as involved in a\nprosentence. The first \u2018it\u2019 in (8*) and (11) still\nfunctions as a pronoun, anaphorically linked to a set of noun\nphrases (sentence nominalizations) supplying objects (sentence\ntokenings) as a domain being quantified over with standard (as opposed\nto sentential or \u201cpropositional\u201d) quantifiers (ibid.,\n302).\n\nBrandom presents a highly flexible view that takes \u2018is\ntrue\u2019 as a general \u201cdenominalizing\u201d device that\napplies to singular terms formed from the nominalization of sentences\nbroadly, not just to pronouns that indicate them. A sentence like\n\u2018It is true that humans are causing climate change\u2019,\nconsidered via a re-rendering as \u2018That humans are\ncausing climate change is true\u2019, is already a\nprosentence on his view, as is a quote-name case like\n\u201c\u2018Birds are dinosaurs\u2019 is true\u201d, and an opaque\ninstance of truth-talk like \u2018Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture is\ntrue\u2019. In this way, Brandom offers a univocal and broader\nprosentential account, according to which, \u201c[i]n each use, a\nprosentence will have an anaphoric antecedent that determines a class\nof admissible substituends for the prosentence (in the lazy case, a\nsingleton). This class of substituends determines the significance of\nthe prosentence associated with it\u201d (ibid.). As a result,\nBrandom can accept both (ES-sent) and (ES-prop) \u2013 the latter\nunderstood as involving no commitment to propositions as entities\n\u2013 on readings closer to their standard interpretations, taking\nthe instances of both to express meaning equivalences. Brandom\u2019s\naccount thus seems to be located in both position \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and\nposition \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) in the chart from Section 1.1, although, as\nwith any prosententialist view, it still denies that the instances of\n(ES) say anything about either sentences or propositions.\n\nDespite its greater flexibility, however, Brandom\u2019s account\nstill faces the central worry confronting prosentential views, namely\nthat truth-talk really does seem predicative, and not just in its\nsurface grammatical form but in our inferential practices with it as\nwell. In arguing for the superiority of his view over that of Grover,\net al., Brandom states that \u201c[t]he account of truth\ntalk should bear the weight of \u2026 divergence of logical from\ngrammatical form only if no similarly adequate account can be\nconstructed that lacks this feature\u201d (ibid., 304). One might\nfind it plausible to extend this principle beyond grammatical form, to\nbehavior in inferences as well. This is an abiding concern for\nattempts to resist inflationism by rejecting its initial assumption,\nnamely, that the alethic locutions function as predicates.\n4. Objections to Deflationism\n\nIn the remainder of this article, we consider a number of objections\nto deflationism. These are by no means the only objections that have\nbeen advanced against the approach, but they seem to be particularly\nobvious and important ones.\n4.1 The Explanatory Role of Truth\n\nThe first objection starts from the observation that (a) in certain\ncontexts an appeal to the notion of truth appears to have an\nexplanatory role and (b) deflationism seems to be inconsistent with\nthat appearance. Some of the contexts in which truth seems to have an\nexplanatory role involve philosophical projects, such as the\n theory of meaning\n (which we will consider below) or explaining the nature of\n knowledge.\n In these cases, the notion of explanation at issue is not so much\ncausal as it is conceptual (see Armour-Garb and Woodbridge\nforthcoming, for more on this). But the notion of truth seems also\nsometimes to play a causal explanatory role, especially with\nregard to explaining various kinds of success \u2013 mainly the\nsuccess of scientific theories/method (cf. Putnam 1978 and Boyd 1983)\nand of people\u2019s behavior (cf. Putnam 1978 and Field 1987), but\nalso the kind of success involved in learning from others (Field\n1972). The causal-explanatory role that the notion of truth appears to\nplay in accounts of these various kinds of success has seemed to many\nphilosophers to constitute a major problem for deflationism. For\nexample, Putnam (1978, 20\u20131, 38) claims, \u201cthe notions of\n\u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018reference\u2019 have a\ncausal-explanatory role in \u2026 an explanation of the\nbehavior of scientists and the success of science\u201d, and\n\u201cthe notion of truth can be used in causal explanations \u2013\nthe success of a man\u2019s behavior may, after all, depend on the\nfact that certain of his beliefs are true \u2013 and the\nformal logic of \u2018true\u2019 [the feature emphasized by\ndeflationism] is not all there is to the notion of\ntruth\u201d.\n\nWhile a few early arguments against deflationism focus on the role of\ntruth in explanations of the success of science (see Williams 1986 and\nFine 1984a, 1984b for deflationary responses to Putnam and Boyd on\nthis), according to Field (1994a, 271), \u201cthe most serious worry\nabout deflationism is that it can\u2019t make sense of the\nexplanatory role of truth conditions: e.g., their role in explaining\nbehavior, or their role in explaining the extent to which behavior is\nsuccessful\u201d. While few theorists endorse the thesis that\nexplanations of behavior in general need to appeal to the notion of\ntruth (even a pre-deflationary Field (1987, 84\u20135) rejects this,\nbut see Devitt 1997, 325\u2013330, for an opposing position),\nexplanations of the latter, i.e., of behavioral success,\nstill typically proceed in terms of an appeal to truth. This poses a\nprima facie challenge to deflationary views. To illustrate\nthe problem, consider the role of the truth-value of an\nindividual\u2019s belief in whether that person succeeds in\nsatisfying her desires. Let us suppose that Mary wants to get to a\nparty, and she believes that it is being held at 1001 Northside\nAvenue. If her belief is true, then, other things being equal, she is\nlikely to get to the party and get what she wants. But suppose that\nher belief is false, and the party is in fact being held at 1001\nSouthside Avenue. Then it would be more likely, other things being\nequal, that she won\u2019t get what she wants. In an example of this\nsort, the truth of her belief seems to be playing a particular role in\nexplaining why she gets what she wants.\n\nAssuming that Mary\u2019s belief is true, and she gets to the party,\nit might seem natural to say that the latter success occurs\nbecause her belief is true, which might seem to pose a\nproblem for deflationists. However, truth-involving explanations of\nparticular instances of success like this don\u2019t really pose a\ngenuine problem. This is because if we are told the specific content\nof the relevant belief, it is possible to replace the apparently\nexplanatory claim that the belief is true with an equivalent claim\nthat does not appeal to truth. In Mary\u2019s particular case, we\ncould replace i) the claim that she believes that the party is being\nheld at 1001 Northside Avenue, and her belief is true, with ii) the\nclaim that she believes that the party is being held at 1001 Northside\nAvenue, and the party \\(is\\) being held at 1001 Northside Avenue. A\ndeflationist can claim that the appeal to truth in the explanation of\nMary\u2019s success just provides an expressive convenience\n(including, perhaps, the convenience of expressing what would\notherwise require an infinite disjunction (of conjunctions like ii)),\nby saying just that what Mary believed was true, if one did not know\nexactly which belief Mary acted on) (cf. Horwich 1998a, 22\u20133,\n44\u20136).\n\nWhile deflationists seem to be able to account for appeals to truth in\nexplanations of particular instances of success, the explanatory-role\nchallenge to deflationism also cites the explanatory role that an\nappeal to truth appears to play in explaining the phenomenon of\nbehavioral success more generally. An explanation of this sort might\ntake the following form:\n\n\n[1]\nPeople act (in general) in such a way that their goals will be\nobtained (as well as possible in the given situation), or in such a\nway that their expectations will not be frustrated, \u2026\nif their beliefs are true.\n[2]\nMany beliefs [people have about how to attain their goals]\nare true.\n[3]\nSo, as a consequence of [1] and [2], people have a tendency to\nattain certain kinds of goals. (Putnam 1978, 101)\n\n\n\nThe generality of [1] in this explanation seems to cover more cases\nthan any definite list of actual beliefs that someone has could\ninclude. Moreover, the fact that [1] supports counterfactuals by\napplying to whatever one might possibly believe (about attaining\ngoals) suggests that it is a law-like generalization. If the truth\npredicate played a fundamental role in the expression of an\nexplanatory law, then deflationism would seem to be\nunsustainable.\n\nA standard deflationary response to this line of reasoning involves\nrejecting the thesis that [1] is a law, seeing it (and truth-involving\nclaims like it) instead as functioning similarly to how the claim\n\u2018What Mary believes is true\u2019 functions in an explanation\nof her particular instance of behavioral success, just expressing an\neven more indefinite, and thus potentially infinite claim. The latter\nis what makes a claim like [1] seem like an explanatory law, but even\nconsidering this indefiniteness, the standard deflationary account of\n[1] claims that the function of the appeal to the notion of truth\nthere is still just to express a kind of generalization. One way to\nbring out this response is to note that, similar to the deflationary\n\u201cinfinite disjunction\u201d account of the claim \u2018What\nMary believes is true\u2019, generalizations of the kind offered in\n[1] entail infinite conjunctions of their instances, which\nare claims that can be formulated without appeal to truth. For\nexample, in the case of explaining someone, \\(A\\), accomplishing their\ngoal of getting to a party, deflationsts typically claim that the role\nof citing possession of a true belief is really just to express an\ninfinite conjunction with something like the following form:\n\nIf \\(A\\) believes that the party is 1001 Northside Avenue, and the\nparty is at 1001 Northside Avenue, then \\(A\\) will get what they want;\nand if \\(A\\) believes that the party is at 1001 Southside Avenue, and\nthe party is at 1001 Southside Ave, then \\(A\\) will get what they\nwant; and if \\(A\\) believes that party is at 17 Elm St, and the party\nis at 17 Elm St, then \\(A\\) will get what they want; \u2026 and so\non.\n\n\nThe equivalence schema (ES) allows one to capture this infinite\nconjunction (of conditionals) in a finite way. For, on the basis of\nthe schema, one can reformulate the infinite conjunction as:\n\nIf \\(A\\) believes that the party is 1001 Northside Avenue, and that\nthe party is 1001 Northside Avenue is true, then \\(A\\) will get what\nthey want; and if \\(A\\) believes that the party is at 1001 Southside\nAvenue, and that the party is at 1001 Southside Avenue is true, then\n\\(A\\) will get what they want, and if \\(A\\) believes that the party is\nat 17 Elm Street, and that the party is at 17 Elm Street is true, then\n\\(A\\) will get what they want; \u2026 and so on.\n\n\nIn turn, this (ES)-reformulated infinite conjunction can be expressed\nas a finite statement with a universal quantifier ranging over\npropositions:\n\nFor every proposition \\(x\\), if what \\(A\\) believes \\(= x\\), and \\(x\\)\nis true, then \\(A\\) will get what they want, other things being equal.\n\n\nThe important point for a deflationist is that one could not express\nthe infinite conjunction regarding the agent\u2019s beliefs and\nbehavioral success unless one had the concept of truth. But\ndeflationists also claim that this is all that the notion of truth is\ndoing here and in similar explanations (cf. Leeds 1978, 1995; Williams\n1986, Horwich 1998a).\n\nHow successful is this standard deflationary response? There are\nseveral critiques in the literature. Some (e.g., Damnjanovic 2005)\nargue that there is no distinction in the first place between\nappearing in a causal-explanatory generalization and being a\ncausal-explanatory property. After all, suppose it is a true\ngeneralization that metal objects conduct electricity. That would\nnormally be taken as sufficient to show that being metal is a\ncausal-explanatory property that one can cite in explaining why\nsomething conducts electricity. But isn\u2019t this a counter, then,\nto deflationism\u2019s thesis that, assuming there is a property of\ntruth at all, it is at most an insubstantial one? If a property is a\ncausal or explanatory property, after all, it is hard to view it as\ninsubstantial.\n\nThe reasoning at issue here may be presented conveniently by expanding\non the general argument considered above and proceeding from an\napparently true causal generalization to the falsity of deflationism\n(ibid.):\n\n\nP1.\nIf a person \\(A\\) has true beliefs, they will get what they want,\nother things being equal.\nC1.\nTherefore, if \\(A\\) has beliefs with the property of being true,\n\\(A\\) will get what they want other things being equal.\nC2.\nTherefore, the property of being true appears in a\ncausal-explanatory generalization.\nC3.\nTherefore, the property of being true is a causal-explanatory\nproperty.\nC4.\nTherefore, deflationism is false.\n\n\n\nCan a deflationist apply the standard deflationary response to this\nargument? Doing so would seem to involve rejecting the inference from\nC2 to C3. After all, the standard reply would say that the role that\nthe appeal to truth plays in P1, the apparent causal generalization,\nis simply its generalizing role of expressing a potentially infinite,\ndisjointed conjunction of unrelated causal connections (cf. Leeds\n1995). So, applying this deflationary response basically hinges on the\nplausibility of rejecting the initial assumption that there is no\ndistinction between appearing in a causal-explanatory generalization\nand being a causal-explanatory property.\n\nIt is worth noting two other responses beyond the standard one that a\ndeflationist might make to the reasoning just set out. The first\noption is to deny the step from P1 to C1. This inference involves the\nexplicit introduction of the property of being true, and, as we have\nseen, some deflationists deny that there is a truth property at all\n(cf. Quine 1970 [1986], Grover, et al. 1975, Leeds 1978,\nBrandom 1994). But, as we noted above, the idea that there is no truth\nproperty may be difficult to sustain given the apparent fact that\n\u2018is true\u2019 functions grammatically as a predicate.\n\nThe second option is to deny the final step from C3 to C4 and concede\nthat there is a sense in which truth is a causal-explanatory property\nand yet say that it is still not a substantive property (cf.\nDamnjanovic 2005). For example, some philosophers (e.g., Friedman\n1974, van Fraassen 1980, Kitcher 1989, Jackson and Pettit 1990) have\noffered different understandings of\n scientific explanation\n and causal explanation, according to which being a causal and\nexplanatory property might not conflict with being insubstantial\n(perhaps by being an abundant or ungroundable property). This might be\nenough to sustain a deflationary position.\n\nThe standard deflationary response to the explanatory-role challenge\nhas also met with criticisms focused on providing explanations of\ncertain \u201chigher-level\u201d phenomena. Philip Kitcher (2002,\n355\u201360) concludes that Horwich\u2019s (1998a, 22\u20133)\napplication of the standard response, in his account of how the notion\nof truth functions in explanations of behavioral success, misses the\nmore systematic role that truth plays in explaining patterns\nof successful behavior, such as when mean-ends beliefs flow from a\nrepresentational device, like a map. Chase Wrenn (2011) agrees with\nKitcher that deflationists need to explain systematic as opposed to\njust singular success, but against Kitcher he argues that\ndeflationists are actually better off than inflationists on this\nfront. Will Gamester (2018, 1252\u20135) raises a different\n\u201chigher-level factor\u201d challenge, one based on the putative\ninability of the standard deflationary account of the role of truth in\nexplanations of behavioral success to distinguish between coincidental\nand non-coincidental success. Gamester (ibid., 1256\u20137) claims\nthat an inflationist could mark and account for the difference between\nthe two kinds of success with an explanation that appeals to the\nnotion of truth. But it is not clear that a deflationist cannot also\navail herself of a version of this truth-involving explanation, taking\nit just as the way of expressing in natural language what one might\nformally express with sentential variables and quantifiers (cf. Ramsey\n1927, 1929; Prior 1971, Wrenn 2021, and Armour-Garb and Woodbridge\nforthcoming).\n4.2 Propositions Versus Sentences\n\nWe noted earlier that deflationism can be presented in either a\nsententialist version or a propositionalist version. Some philosophers\nhave suggested, however, that the choice between these two versions\nconstitutes a dilemma for deflationism (Jackson, Oppy, and Smith\n1994). The objection is that if deflationism is construed in\naccordance with propositionalism, then it is trivial, but if it is\nconstrued in accordance with sententialism, it is false. To illustrate\nthe dilemma, consider the following claim:\n\n(12)\nSnow is white is true if and only if snow is white.\n\n\nNow, does \u2018snow is white\u2019 in (12) refer to a\nsentence or a proposition? If, on the one hand, we take (12) to be\nabout a sentence, then, assuming (12) can be interpreted as making a\nnecessary claim, it is false. On the face of it, after all, it takes a\nlot more than snow\u2019s being white for it to be the case that\n\u2018snow is white\u2019 is true. In order for \u2018snow is\nwhite\u2019 to be true, it must be the case not only that snow is\nwhite, it must, in addition, be the case that \u2018snow is\nwhite\u2019 means that snow is white. But this is a fact\nabout language that (12) ignores. On the other hand, suppose we take\n\u2018snow is white\u2019 in (12) to denote the proposition\nthat snow is white. Then the approach looks to be trivial, since the\nproposition that snow is white is defined as being the one that is\ntrue just in case snow is white. Thus, deflationism faces the dilemma\nof being false or trivial.\n\nOne response for the deflationist is to remain with the\npropositionalist version of their doctrine and accept its triviality.\nA trivial doctrine, after all, at least has the advantage of being\ntrue.\n\nA second response is to resist the suggestion that propositionist\ndeflationism is trivial. For one thing, the triviality here does not\nhave its source in the concept of truth, but rather in the concept of\na proposition. Moreover, even if we agree that the proposition that\nsnow is white is defined as the one that is true if and only if snow\nis white, this still leaves open whether truth is a substantive\nproperty of that proposition; as such it leaves open whether\ndeflationism or inflationism is correct.\n\nA third response to this dilemma is to accept that deflationism\napplies inter alia to sentences, but to argue (following\nField 1994a) that the sentences to which it applies must be\ninterpreted sentences, i.e., sentences which already have\nmeaning attached to them. While it takes more than snow being white to\nmake the sentence \u2018snow is white\u2019 true, when we think of\nit as divorced from its meaning, that is not so clear when we treat it\nas having the meaning it in fact has.\n4.3 Correspondence\n\nIt is often said to be a platitude that true statements correspond to\nthe facts. The so-called \u201ccorrespondence theory of truth\u201d\nis built around this intuition and tries to explain the notion of\ntruth by appealing to the notions of correspondence and fact. But even\nif one does not build one\u2019s approach to truth around\nthis intuition, many philosophers regard it as a condition of adequacy\non any approach that it accommodate this correspondence intuition.\n\nIt is often claimed, however, that deflationism has trouble meeting\nthis adequacy condition. One way to bring out the problem here is by\nfocusing on a particular articulation of the correspondence intuition,\none favored by deflationists themselves (e.g., Horwich 1998a).\nAccording to this way of spelling it out, the intuition that a certain\nsentence or proposition \u201ccorresponds to the facts\u201d is the\nintuition that the sentence or proposition is true because of\nhow the world is; that is, the truth of the proposition is\nexplained by some fact, which is usually external to the\nproposition itself. We might express this by saying that someone who\nendorses the correspondence intuition so understood would endorse:\n\n(6)\nThe proposition that snow is white is true because snow\nis white.\n\n\nThe problem with (6) is that, when we combine it with deflationism\n\u2013 or at least with a necessary version of that approach \u2013\nwe can derive something that is plainly false. Anyone who assumes that\nthe instances of the equivalence schema are necessary would clearly be\ncommitted to the necessary truth of:\n\n(7)\nThe proposition that snow is white is true iff snow is white.\n\n\nAnd, since (7) is a necessary truth, under that assumption, it is very\nplausible to suppose that (6) and (7) together entail:\n\n(8)\nSnow is white because snow is white.\n\n\nBut (8) is clearly false. The reason is that the \u2018because\u2019\nin (6) and (8) is a causal or explanatory relation, and plausibly such\nrelations must obtain between distinct relata. But the relata in (8)\nare (obviously) not distinct. Hence, (8) is false, and this means that\nthe conjunction of (6) and (7) must be false, and that deflationism is\ninconsistent with the correspondence intuition. To borrow a phrase of\nMark Johnston\u2019s (1989) \u2013 who mounts a similar argument in\na different context \u2013 we might say that if deflationism is true,\nthen what seems to be a perfectly good explanation in (6) goes\nmissing; if deflationism is true, after all, then (6) is\nequivalent to (8), and (8) is not an explanation of anything.\n\nOne way a deflationist might attempt to respond to this objection is\nby providing a different articulation of the correspondence intuition.\nFor example, one might point out that the connection between the\nproposition that snow is white being true and snow\u2019s being white\nis not a contingent connection and suggest that this rules out (6) as\na successful articulation of the correspondence intuition. That\nintuition (one might continue) is more plausibly given voice by\n\n(6*)\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 is true because snow is white.\n\n\nHowever, when (6*) is conjoined with (7), one cannot derive the\nproblematic (8), and thus, one might think, the objection from\ncorrespondence might be avoided. Now, certainly this is a possible\nsuggestion; the problem with it, however, is that a deflationist who\nthinks that (6*) is true is most plausibly construed as holding a\nsententialist, rather than a propositionalist, version of\ndeflationism. A sententialist version of deflationism will supply a\nversion of (7), viz.:\n\n(7*)\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 is true iff snow is white.\n\n\nwhich, at least if it is interpreted as a necessary (or analytic)\ntruth, will conspire with (6*) to yield (8). And we are back where we\nstarted.\n\nAnother response would be to object that \u2018because\u2019 creates\nan opaque context \u2013 that is, the kind of context within\nwhich one cannot substitute co-referring expressions and preserve\ntruth. However, for this to work, \u2018because\u2019 must create an\nopaque context of the right kind. In general, we can distinguish two\nkinds of opaque context: intensional contexts, which allow\nthe substitution of necessarily co-referring expressions but not\ncontingently co-referring expressions; and\n hyperintensional\n contexts, which do not even allow the substitution of necessarily\nco-referring expressions. If the inference from (6) and (7) to (8) is\nto be successfully blocked, it is necessary that \u2018because\u2019\ncreates a hyperintensional context. A proponent of the correspondence\nobjection might try to argue that while \u2018because\u2019 creates\nan intensional context, it does not create a hyperintensional context.\nBut since a hyperintensional reading of \u2018because\u2019 has\nbecome standard fare, this approach remains open to a deflationist and\nis not an ad hoc fix.\n\nA final, and most radical, response would be to reject the\ncorrespondence intuition outright. This response is not as drastic as\nit sounds. In particular, deflationists do not have to say that\nsomeone who says \u2018the proposition that snow is white corresponds\nto the facts\u2019 is speaking falsely. Deflationists might do better\nby saying that such a person is simply using a picturesque or ornate\nway of saying that the proposition is true, where truth is understood\nin accordance with deflationism. Indeed, a deflationist can even agree\nthat, for certain rhetorical or conversational purposes, it might be\nmore effective to use talk of \u201ccorrespondence to the\nfacts\u201d. Nevertheless, it is important to see that this response\ndoes involve a burden, since it involves rejecting a condition of\nadequacy that many regard as binding.\n4.4 Truth-Value Gaps\n\nAccording to some metaethicists\n (moral non-cognitivists\n or expressivists), moral claims \u2013 such as the injunction that\none ought to return people\u2019s phone calls \u2013 are neither\ntrue nor false. The same situation holds, according to some\nphilosophers of language, for claims that presuppose the existence of\nsomething which does not in fact exist, such as the claim that the\npresent King of France is bald; for sentences that are vague, such as\n\u2018These grains of sand constitute a heap\u2019; and for\nsentences that are paradoxical, such as those that arise in connection\nwith the\n Liar Paradox.\n Let us call this thesis the gap, since it finds a gap in the\nclass of sentences between those that are true and those that are\nfalse.\n\nThe deflationary approach to truth has seemed to be inconsistent with\nthe gap, and this has been thought by some (e.g., Dummett 1959 [1978,\n4] and Holton 2000) to be an objection. The reason for the apparent\ninconsistency flows from a natural way to extend the deflationary\napproach from truth to falsity. The most natural thing for a\ndeflationist to do is to introduce a falsity schema like:\n\n(F-sent)\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is false iff \\({\\sim}p.\\)\n\n\nFollowing Holton (1993, 2000), we consider (F-sent) to be the relevant\nschema for falsity, rather than some propositional schema, since the\nstandard understanding of a gappy sentence is as one that does not\nexpress a proposition (cf. Jackson, et al. 1994).\n\nWith a schema like (F-sent) in hand, deflationists could say things\nabout falsity similar to what they say about truth: (F-sent) exhausts\nthe notion of falsity, there is no substantive property of falsity,\nthe utility of the concept of falsity is just a matter of facilitating\nthe expression of certain generalizations, etc.\n\nHowever, there is a seeming incompatibility between (F-sent) and the\ngap. Suppose, for reductio, that \u2018S\u2019 is a\nsentence that is neither true nor false. In that case, it is not the\ncase that \u2018S\u2019 is true, and it is not the case that\n\u2018S\u2019 is false. But then, by (ES-sent) and (F-sent), we can\ninfer that it is not the case that S, and it is not the case that\nnot-S; in short: \\({\\sim}\\)S and \\({\\sim}{\\sim}\\)S, which is a\nclassical contradiction. Clearly, then, we must give up one of these\nthings. But which one can we give up consistently with\ndeflationism?\n\nIn the context of ethical non-cognitivism, one possible response to\nthe apparent dilemma is to distinguish between a deflationary account\nof truth and a deflationary account of truth-aptitude (cf.\nJackson, et al. 1994). By accepting an inflationary account\nof the latter, one can claim that ethical statements fail the robust\ncriteria of \u201ctruth-aptitude\u201d (reidentified in terms of\nexpression of belief), even if a deflationary view of truth still\nallows the application of the truth predicate to them, via\ninstances of (ES). In the case of\n vagueness,\n one might adopt epistemicism about it and claim that vague sentences\nactually have truth-values, we just can\u2019t know them (cf.\nWilliamson 1994. For an alternative, see Field 1994b).\n\nWith respect to the Liar Paradox, the apparent conflict between\ndeflationism and the gap has led some (e.g., Simmons 1999) to conclude\nthat deflationism is hobbled with respect to dealing with the problem,\nsince most prominent approaches to doing so, stemming from the work of\nSaul Kripke (1975), involve an appeal to truth-value gaps. One\nalternative strategy a deflationist might pursue in attempting to\nresolve the Liar is to offer a non-classical logic. Field 2008 adopts\nthis approach and restricts the law of the excluded middle. JC Beall\n(2002) combines truth-value gaps with Kleene logic (see the entry on\n many-valued Logic)\n and makes use of both weak and strong\n negation.\n Armour-Garb and Beall (2001, 2003) argue that deflationists can and\nshould be\n dialetheists\n and accept that some truthbearers are both true and not true (see\nalso, Woodbridge 2005, 152\u20133, on adopting a\n paraconsistent logic\n that remains \u201cquasi-classical\u201d). By contrast, Armour-Garb\nand Woodbridge (2013, 2015) develop a version of the\n\u201cmeaningless strategy\u201d with respect to the Liar (based on\nGrover 1977), which they claim a deflationist can use to dissolve that\nparadox and semantic pathology more generally, without accepting\ngenuine truth-value gaps or giving up classical logic.\n4.5 The Generalization Problem\n\nSince deflationists place such heavy emphasis on the role of the\nconcept of truth in expressing generalizations, it seems somewhat\nironic that certain versions of deflationism have been criticized for\nbeing incapable of accounting for generalizations involving\ntruth (Gupta 1993a, 1993b; Field 1994a, 2008; Horwich 1998a\n(137\u20138), 2001; Halbach 1999 and 2011 (57\u20139); Soames 1999,\nArmour-Garb 2004, 2010, 2011). The \u201cGeneralization\nProblem\u201d (henceforth, \\(GP)\\) captures the worry that a\ndeflationary account of truth is inadequate for explaining our\ncommitments to general facts we express with certain uses of\n\u2018true\u2019. This raises the question of whether and, if so,\nhow, deflationary accounts earn the right to endorse such\ngeneralizations.\n\nAlthough Tarski (1935 [1956]) places great importance on the instances\nof his (T)-schema, he comes to recognize that those instances do not\nprovide a fully adequate way of characterizing truth. Moreover, even\nwhen the instances of (T) are taken as theorems, Tarski (ibid.) points\nout that taken all together they are insufficient for proving a\n\u2018true\u2019-involving generalization like\n\n(A)\nAll sentences of the form \u2018If \\(p\\), then \\(p\\)\u2019 are\ntrue.\n\n\nsince the collection of the instances of (T) is \\(\\omega\\)-incomplete\n(where a theory, \\(\\theta\\), is \\(\\omega\\)-incomplete if\n\\(\\theta\\) can prove every instance of an open formula\n\u2018\\(Fx\\)\u2019 but cannot prove the universal generalization,\n\u2018\\(\\forall xFx\\)\u2019).\n\nWe arrive at a related problem when we combine a reliance on the\ninstances of some version of (ES) with Quine\u2019s view about the\nfunctioning and utility of the truth predicate. He (1992, 81)\nconsiders the purpose of (A) to be to express a generalization over\nsentences like the following:\n\n(B)\nIf it is raining, then it is raining.\n(C)\nIf snow is white, then snow is white.\n\n\nQuine points out that we want to be able to generalize on the embedded\nsentences in those conditionals, by semantically ascending,\nabstracting logical form, and deriving (A). But, as Tarski (ibid.)\nnotes, this feat cannot be achieved, given only a commitment to (the\ninstances of) (T). From (T) and (A), we can prove (B) and (C) but,\ngiven the finitude of deduction, when equipped only with the instances\nof (T), we cannot prove (A). As a consequence of the Compactness\nTheorem of first-order logic, anything provable from the totality of\nthe instances of (T) is provable from just finitely many of them, so\nany theory that takes the totality of the instances of (T) to\ncharacterize truth will be unable to prove any generalization like\n(A).\n\nTo address the question of why we need to be able to prove these\ntruth-involving generalizations, suppose that we accept a proposition\nlike \\(\\langle\\)Every proposition of the form \\(\\langle\\)if \\(p\\),\nthen \\(p\\rangle\\) is true\\(\\rangle\\). Call this proposition\n\u201c\\(\\beta\\)\u201d. Now take \u2018\\(\\Gamma\\)\u2019 to stand\nfor the collection of propositions that are the instances of\n\\(\\beta\\). Horwich (2001) maintains that an account of the meaning of\n\u2018true\u2019 will be adequate only if it aids in explaining why\nwe accept the members of \\(\\Gamma\\), where such explanations amount to\nproofs of those propositions by, among other things, employing an\nexplanatory premise that does not explicitly concern the truth\npredicate. So, one reason it is important to be able to prove a\n\u2018true\u2019-involving generalization is because this is a\ncondition of adequacy for an account of the meaning of that term. One\nmight argue that anyone who grasps the concept of truth, and that of\nthe relevant conditional, should be said to know \\(\\beta\\). But if a\ngiven account of truth, together with an account of the conditional\n(along, perhaps, with an account of other logical notions), does not\nentail \\(\\beta\\), then it does not provide an acceptable account of\ntruth.\n\nHere is another reason for thinking that generalizations like\n\\(\\beta\\) must be proved. A theory of the meaning of\n\u2018true\u2019 should explain our acceptance of propositions like\n\\(\\beta\\), which, as Gupta (1993a) and Hill (2002) emphasize, should\nbe knowable a priori by anyone who possesses the concept of\ntruth (and who grasps the relevant logical concepts). But if such a\nproposition can be known a priori on the basis of a grasp of\nthe concept of truth (and of the relevant logical concepts), then a\ntheory that purports to specify the meaning of \u2018true\u2019\nshould be able to explain our acceptance of that proposition. But if\nan account of the meaning of \u2018true\u2019 is going to do this,\nit must be possible to derive the proposition from one or more of the\nclauses that constitute our grasp of the concept of truth.\n\nThis creates a problem for a Horwichian minimalist. Let us suppose\nthat \\(\\beta\\) is one of the general propositions that must be\nprovable. Restricted to the resources available through\nHorwich\u2019s minimalism, we can show that \\(\\beta\\) cannot be\nderived.\n\nIf a Horwichian minimalist could derive \\(\\beta\\), it would have to be\nderived from the instances of\n\n(E)\n\\(\\langle p\\rangle\\) is true iff \\(p.\\)\n\n\nBut there cannot be a valid derivation of a universal generalization\nfrom a set of particular propositions unless that set is inconsistent.\nSince, according to Horwich (1998a), every instance of (E) that is\npart of his theory of truth is consistent, it follows that there\ncannot be a derivation of \\(\\beta\\) from the instances of (E). This is\na purely logical point. As such, considerations of pure logic dictate\nthat our acceptance of \\(\\beta\\) cannot be explained by\nHorwich\u2019s account of truth. Since Horwich takes all instances of\nthe propositional version of (T) (i.e., (ES-prop)) as axioms, he can\nprove each of those instances. But, as we have seen, restricted to the\ninstances of the equivalence schema, he cannot prove the\ngeneralization, \\(\\beta\\), i.e., \\(\\langle\\)Every proposition of the\nform \\(\\langle\\)if \\(p\\) then \\(p\\rangle\\) is true\\(\\rangle\\).\n\nSome deflationists respond to the GP by using a version of (GT) to\nformulate their approach:\n\n(GT)\n\\(\\forall x\\) \\((x\\) is true iff \\(\\Sigma p(x = \\langle p\\rangle\n\\amp p)).\\)\n\n\nIn this context, there are two things to notice about (GT). First, it\nis not a schema but a universally quantified formula. For this reason,\nit is possible to derive a generalization like \\(\\beta\\) from it.\nSecond, the existential quantifier, \u2018\\(\\Sigma\\)\u2019, in (GT)\nmust be a higher-order quantifier (see the entry on\n second-order and higher-order logic)\n that quantifies into sentential positions. We mentioned above an\napproach that takes this quantifier as a substitutional one, where the\nsubstitution class consists of sentences. We also mentioned\nHill\u2019s (2002) alternative version that takes the substitution\nclass to be the set of all propositions. K\u00fcnne (2003) suggests a\ndifferent approach that takes \u2018\\(\\Sigma\\)\u2019 to be an\nobjectual (domain and values) quantifier ranging over propositions.\nHowever, parallel to Horwich\u2019s rejection of (GT) discussed in\nSection 3.1, all of these approaches have drawn criticism on the\ngrounds that the use of higher-order quantifiers to define truth is\ncircular (cf. Platts 1980, McGrath 2000), and may get the extension of\nthe concept of truth wrong (cf. Sosa 1993).\n\nAn alternative deflationist approach to the GP attempts to show that,\ndespite appearances, certain deflationary theories do have the\nresources to derive the relevant generalizations. Field (1994a,\n2001a), for example, suggests that we allow reasoning with schemas\ndirectly and proposes rules that would allow the derivation of\ngeneralizations. Horwich (1998a, 2001) suggests a more informal\napproach according to which we are justified in deriving \\(\\beta\\)\nsince an informal inspection of a derivation of some instance of\n\\(\\beta\\) shows us that we could derive any instance of it. For\nreplies to Horwich, see Armour-Garb 2004, 2010, 2011; Gupta 1993a,\n1993b; and Soames 1999. For responses to Armour-Garb\u2019s attack on\nHorwich 2001, see Oms 2019 and Cie\u015bli\u0144ski 2018.\n4.6 Conservativeness\n\nAn ideal theory of truth will be both consistent (e.g., avoid the Liar\nParadox) and adequate (e.g., allow us to derive all the essential laws\nof truth, such as those at issue in the Generalization Problem). Yet\nit has recently been argued that even if deflationists can provide a\nconsistent theory of truth and avoid the GP, they still cannot provide\nan adequate theory.\n\nThis argument turns on the notion of a conservative extension of a\ntheory. Informally, a conservative extension of a theory is one that\ndoes not allow us to prove anything that could not be proved from the\noriginal, unextended theory. More formally, and applied to theories of\ntruth, a truth theory, \\(Tr\\) is conservative over some theory \\(T\\)\nformulated in language \\(L\\) if and only if for every sentence\n\\(\\phi\\) of \\(L\\) in which the truth predicate does not occur, if \\(Tr\n\\cup L \\vdash \\phi\\), then \\(L \\vdash \\phi\\) (where\n\u2018\\(\\vdash\\)\u2019 represents provability). Certain\ntruth theories are conservative over arithmetic \u2013 e.g., theories\nthat implicitly define truth using only the instances of some version\nof (ES) \u2013 and certain truth theories are not \u2013 e.g.,\nTarski\u2019s (1935 [1956], 1944) compositional theory. Specifically,\nthe addition of certain truth theories allows us to prove that\narithmetic is consistent, something that we cannot do if we are\nconfined to arithmetic itself.\n\nIt has been argued (a) that conservative truth theories are inadequate\nand (b) that deflationists are committed to conservative truth\ntheories. (See Shapiro 1998 and Ketland 1999; Horsten 1995 provides an\nearlier version of this argument.) We will explain the arguments for\n(a) below but to get a flavor of the arguments for (b), consider\nShapiro\u2019s rhetorical question: \u201cHow thin can the notion of\narithmetic truth be, if by invoking it we can learn more about the\nnatural numbers?\u201d Shapiro is surely right to press deflationists\non their frequent claims that truth is \u201cthin\u201d or\n\u201cinsubstantial\u201d. It might also be a worry for\ndeflationists if any adequate truth theory allowed us to derive\nnon-logical truths, if they endorse the thesis that truth is merely a\n\u201clogical property\u201d. On the other hand, deflationists\nthemselves insist that truth is an expressively useful device, and so\nthey cannot be faulted for promoting a theory of truth that allows us\nto say more about matters not involving truth.\n\nTo see an argument for (a), consider a G\u00f6del sentence, \\(G\\),\nformulated within the language of Peano Arithmetic (henceforth,\n\\(PA)\\). \\(G\\) is not a theorem of PA if PA is consistent (cf. the\nentry on\n G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems).\n But \\(G\\) becomes a theorem when PA is expanded by adding certain\nplausible principles that appear to govern a truth predicate. Thus,\nthe resultant theory of arithmetical truth is strong enough to prove G\nand appears therefore to be non-conservative over arithmetic. If, as\nhas been argued by a number of theorists, any adequate account of\ntruth will be non-conservative over a base theory, then deflationists\nappear to be in trouble.\n\nUnderstood in this way, the \u201cConservativeness Argument\u201d\n(henceforth, \\(CA)\\) is a variant of the objection considered in\nSection 4.1, claiming that truth plays an explanatory role that\ndeflationism cannot accommodate. There are several deflationary\nresponses to the CA. Field (1999) argues that the worries that arise\nfrom the claim that deflationists are in violation of explanatory\nconservativeness is unfounded. He (ibid., 537) appeals to the\nexpressive role of the truth predicate and maintains that\ndeflationists are committed to a form of \u201cexplanatory\nconservativeness\u201d only insofar as there are no explanations in\nwhich the truth predicate is not playing its generalizing role. As a\nresult, he (ibid.) notes that \u201cany use of \u2018true\u2019 in\nexplanations which derives solely from its role as a device of\ngeneralization should be perfectly acceptable\u201d. For responses to\nField, see Horsten 2011 (61) and Halbach 2011 (315\u20136).\n\nResponding to the CA, Daniel Waxman (2017) identifies two readings of\n\u2018conservativeness\u2019, one semantic and the other syntactic,\nwhich correspond to two conceptions of arithmetic. On the first\nconception, arithmetic is understood categorically as given\nby the standard model. On the second conception, arithmetic is\nunderstood axiomatically and is captured by the acceptance of\nsome first-order theory, such as PA. Waxman argues that deflationism\ncan be conservative given either conception, so that the CA does not\ngo through.\n\nJulien Murzi and Lorenzo Rossi (2018) argue that Waxman\u2019s\nattempt at marrying deflationism with conservativeness \u2013 his\n\u201cconservative deflationism\u201d \u2013 is unsuccessful. They\n(ibid.) reject the adoption of this view on the assumption that\none\u2019s conception of arithmetic is axiomatic, claiming, in\neffect, that a deflationist\u2019s commitment to a conservative\nconception of truth is misguided (cf. Halbach 2011, Horsten 2011,\nCie\u015bli\u0144ski 2015, and Galinon 2015).\n\nJody Azzouni (1999) defends the \u201cfirst-order\ndeflationist\u201d, viz., a deflationist who endorses what Waxman\n(ibid.) calls \u201cthe axiomatic conception of arithmetic\u201d and\nwhose subsequent understanding cannot rule out the eligibility of\nnon-standard models. Azzouni accepts the need to prove certain\n\u2018true\u2019-involving generalizations, but he maintains that\nthere are some generalizations that are about truths that a\nfirst-order deflationist need not prove. He further contends that if\none does extend her theory of truth in a way that allows her to\nestablish these generalizations, she should not expect her theory to\nbe conservative, nor should she continue describing it as a\ndeflationary view of truth. For a response to Azzouni\n(ibid.), see Waxman (2017, 453).\n\nIn line with Field\u2019s response to the CA, Lavinia Picollo and\nThomas Schindler (2020) argue that the conservativeness constraint\nimposed by Horsten 1995, Shapiro 1998, Ketland 1999, and others is not\na reasonable requirement to impose on deflationary accounts. They\ncontend that the insistence on conservativeness arises from making too\nmuch of the metaphor of \u201cinsubstantiality\u201d and that it\nfails to see what the function of the truth predicate really amounts\nto. Their leading idea is that, from a deflationist\u2019s\nperspective, the logico-linguistic function of the truth predicate is\nto simulate sentential and predicate quantification in a first-order\nsetting (cf. Horwich 1998a, 4, n. 1). They maintain that, for a\ndeflationist, in conjunction with first-order quantifiers, the truth\npredicate has the same function as sentential and predicate\nquantifiers. So, we should not expect the deflationist\u2019s truth\ntheory to conservatively extend its base theory.\n4.7 Normativity\n\nIt is commonly said that our beliefs and assertions aim at truth, or\npresent things as being true, and that truth is therefore a\nnorm of assertion and belief. This putative fact about truth\nand assertion in particular has been seen to suggest that deflationism\nmust be false (cf. Wright 1992 and Bar-On and Simmons 2007). However,\nthe felt incompatibility between normativity and deflationism is\ndifficult to make precise.\n\nThe first thing to note is that there is certainly a sense in which\ndeflationism is consistent with the idea that truth is a norm of\nassertion. To illustrate this, notice (as we saw in examining\ntruth\u2019s putative explanatory role) that we can obtain an\nintuitive understanding of this idea without mentioning truth at all,\nso long as we focus on a particular case. Suppose that for whatever\nreason Mary sincerely believes that snow is green, has good evidence\nfor this belief, and on the basis of this belief and evidence asserts\nthat snow is green. We might say that there is a norm of assertion\nthat implies that Mary is still open to criticism in this case. After\nall, since snow is not green, there must be something\nincorrect or defective about Mary\u2019s assertion\n(and similarly for her belief). It is this incorrectness or\ndefectiveness that the idea that truth is a norm of assertion (and\nbelief) is trying to capture.\n\nTo arrive at a general statement of the norm that lies behind this\nparticular case, consider that here, what we recognize is\n\n(13)\nIf someone asserts that snow is green when snow is not green, then\nthat assertion is open to criticism.\n\n\nTo generalize on this, what we want to do is generalize on the\npositions occupied by \u2018snow is green\u2019 and express\nsomething along the lines of\n\n(14)\nFor all \\(p\\), if someone asserts that \\(p\\) when \\({\\sim}p\\),\nthen that assertion is open to criticism.\n\n\nThe problem of providing a general statement like (14) is the same\nissue first raised in Section 1.3, and the solution by now should be\nfamiliar. To state the norm in general we would need to be able to do\nsomething we seem unable to do in ordinary language, namely, employ\nsentential variables and quantifiers for them. But this is where the\nnotion of truth comes in. Because (ES) gives us its\ncontraposition,\n\n(ES-con)\n\\({\\sim}p\\) iff \\(\\langle p\\rangle\\) is not true.\n\n\nReading \u2018\\(\\langle p\\rangle\\)\u2019 as \u2018that\n\\(p\\)\u2019, we can reformulate (14) as\n\n(15)\nFor all \\(p\\), if someone asserts that \\(p\\) when that \\(p\\) is\nnot true, then that assertion is open to criticism.\n\n\nBut since the variable \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 occurs only in nominalized\ncontexts in (15), we can replace it with an object variable,\n\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019, and bind this with an ordinary objectual\nquantifier, to get\n\n(16)\nFor all \\(x\\), if someone asserts \\(x\\), and \\(x\\) is not true,\nthen that assertion is open to criticism.\n\n\nOr, to put it as some philosophers might:\n\n(N)\nTruth is a norm of assertion.\n\n\nIn short, then, deflationists need not deny that we appeal to the\nnotion of truth to express a norm of assertion; on the\ncontrary, the concept of truth seems required to state that very\ngeneralization.\n\nIf deflationists can account for the fact that we must apply the\nnotion of truth to express a norm of assertion, then does normativity\npose any problem for deflationism? Crispin Wright (1992, 15\u201323)\nargues that it does, claiming that deflationism is inherently unstable\nbecause there is a distinctive norm for assertoric practice that goes\nbeyond the norms for warranted assertibility \u2013 that the norms of\ntruth and warranted assertibility are potentially extensionally\ndivergent. This separate norm of truth, he claims, is already implicit\njust in acceptance of the instances of (ES). He points out that not\nhaving warrant to assert some sentence does not yield having warrant\nto assert its negation. However, because (ES) gives us (ES-con), we\nhave, in each instance, an inference (going from right to left) from\nthe sentence mentioned not being true to the negation of the sentence.\nBut the instance of (ES) for the negation of any sentence,\n\n(ES-neg)\n\\(\\langle{\\sim} p \\rangle\\) is true iff \\({\\sim}p,\\)\n\n\ntakes us (again, going from right to left) from the negated sentence\nto an ascription of truth to that negated sentence. Thus, some\nsentence not being true does yield that the negation of the\nsentence is true, in contrast with warranted assertibility. This\ndifference, Wright (ibid., 18) claims, reveals that, by\ndeflationism\u2019s own lights, the truth predicate expresses a\ndistinct norm governing assertion, which is incompatible with the\ndeflationary contention \u201cthat \u2018true\u2019 is only\ngrammatically a predicate whose role is not to attribute a substantial\ncharacteristic\u201d.\n\nRejecting Wright\u2019s argument for the instability of deflationism,\nIan Rumfitt (1995, 103) notes that if we add the ideas of denying\nsomething and of having warrant for doing so\n(\u201canti-warrant\u201d) to Wright\u2019s characterization of\ndeflationism, this would make \u2018is not true\u2019 simply a\ndevice of rejection governed by the norm that \u201c[t]he predicate\n\u2018is not true\u2019 may be applied to any sentence for which one\nhas an anti-warrant\u201d. But then truth-talk\u2019s behavior with\nnegation would not have to be seen as indicating that it marks a\ndistinct norm beyond justified assertibility and justifiable\ndeniability, which would be perfectly compatible with\ndeflationism.\n\nField (1994a, 264\u20135) offers a deflationary response to\nWright\u2019s challenge (as well as to a similar objection regarding\nnormativity from Putnam (1983a, 279\u201380)), pointing again to the\ngeneralizing role of the truth predicate in such normative desires as\none to utter only true sentences or one to have only true beliefs.\nField agrees with Wright that truth-talk expresses a norm beyond\nwarranted assertibility, but he (1994a, 265) also maintains that\n\u201cthere is no difficulty in desiring that all one\u2019s beliefs\nbe disquotationally true; and not only can each of us desire such\nthings, there can be a general practice of badgering other to into\nhaving such desires\u201d. Horwich (1996, 879\u201380) argues that\nWright\u2019s rejection of deflationism does not follow from showing\nthat one can use the truth predicate to express a norm beyond\nwarranted assertibility. Like Field, Horwich claims that Wright missed\nthe point that, in the expression of such a norm, the truth predicate\nis just playing its generalizing role. For other objections to\ndeflationism based on truth\u2019s normative role, see Price 1998,\n2003 and McGrath 2003.\n4.8 Inflationist Deflationism?\n\nAnother objection to deflationism begins by drawing attention to a\nlittle-known doctrine about truth that G.E. Moore held at the\nbeginning of the 20th Century. Richard Cartwright (1987, 73) describes\nthe view as follows: \u201ca true proposition is one that has a\ncertain simple unanalyzable property, and a false proposition is one\nthat lacks the property\u201d. This doctrine about truth is to be\nunderstood as the analogue for the doctrine that Moore held about\ngoodness, namely that goodness is a simple, unanalyzable quality.\n\nThe potential problem that this Moorean view about truth presents for\ndeflationism might best be expressed in the form of a question: What\nis the difference between the Moorean view and deflationism? One might\nreply that, according to deflationary theories, the concept of truth\nhas an important logical role, i.e., expressing certain\ngeneralizations, whereas the concept of goodness does not. However,\nthis doesn\u2019t really answer our question. For one thing, it\nisn\u2019t clear that Moore\u2019s notion of truth does not also\ncapture generalizations, since it too will yield all of the instances\nof (ES). For another, the idea that the concept of truth plays an\nimportant logical role doesn\u2019t distinguish the metaphysics of\ndeflationary conceptions from the metaphysics of the Moorean view, and\nit is the metaphysics of the matter that the present objection really\nbrings into focus. Alternatively, one might suggest that the\ndistinction between truth according to Moore\u2019s view and\ndeflationary conceptions of truth is the distinction between having a\nsimple unanalyzable nature, and not having any underlying nature at\nall. But what is that distinction? It is certainly not obvious that\nthere is any distinction between having a nature about which nothing\ncan be said and having no nature at all.\n\nHow might a deflationist respond to this alleged problem? The key move\nwill be to focus on the property of being true. For the Moorean, this\nproperty is a simple unanalyzable one. But deflationists need not be\ncommitted to this. As we have seen, some deflationists think that\nthere is no truth property at all. And even among deflationists who\naccept that there is some insubstantial truth property, it is not\nclear that this is the sort of property that the Moorean has in mind.\nTo say that a property is unanalyzable suggests that the property is a\nfundamental property. One might understand this in something like the\nsense that Lewis proposes, i.e., as a property that is sparse and\nperfectly natural. Or one might understand a fundamental property as\none that is groundable but not grounded in anything. But deflationists\nneed not understand a purported property of being true in either of\nthese ways. As noted in Section 1.2, they may think of it as an\nabundant property rather than a sparse one, or as one that is\nungroundable. In this way, there are options available for\ndeflationists who want to distinguish themselves from the Moorean view\nof truth.\n4.9 Truth and Meaning\n\nThe final objection that we will consider concerns the relation\nbetween deflationism and theories of meaning, i.e., theories about how\nsentences get their meanings.\n\nThe orthodox approach to this last question appeals to the notion of\ntruth, suggesting, roughly, that a sentence \\(S\\) means that \\(p\\)\njust in case \\(S\\) is true if and only if \\(p\\). This approach to\nmeaning, known widely as \u201ctruth-conditional semantics\u201d, is\nhistorically associated with\n Donald Davidson\u2019s\n (1967) thesis that the \u201c(T)-sentences\u201d (i.e., the\ninstances of the (T)-schema) generated by a Tarski-truth-definition\nfor a language give the meanings of the sentences they mention, by\nspecifying their truth conditions. In contemporary linguistics, a\nprominent approach to sentence meaning explains it in terms of\npropositions, understood (following Lewis 1970 and Stalnaker 1970) as\nsets of possible worlds, which amount to encapsulations of truth\nconditions (Elbourne 2011, 50\u201351).\n\nThis has led a number of philosophers to argue that, on pain of\ncircularity, deflationism cannot be combined with theories of meaning\nthat make use of the notion of truth to explain meaning \u2013 in\nother words, that deflationism is incompatible with truth-conditional\ntheories of meaning. This assessment of deflationism stems from\nDummett\u2019s (1959 [1978, 7]) claim that the (T)-sentences (or the\ninstances of any other version of (ES)) cannot both tell us what the\nsentences they nominalize mean and give us an account of\n\u2018true\u2019. As Horwich (1998a, 68) puts it, \u201cwe would be\nfaced with something like a single equation and two unknowns\u201d\n(cf. Davidson 1990, 1996; Horwich 1998b, Kalderon 1999, Collins\n2002).\n\nThe first thing to say regarding this objection is that, even if\ndeflationism were inconsistent with truth-conditional theories of\nmeaning, this would not automatically constitute an objection\nto deflationism. After all, there are alternative theories of meaning\navailable, and most deflationists reject truth-conditional semantics\nin favor of some \u201ctruth-free\u201d alternative. The main\nalternatives available include Brandom\u2019s (1994) inferentialism,\ndeveloped following\n Wilfrid Sellars\n (1974, 1979); Horwich\u2019s (1998b) use-theory of meaning, inspired\nby Wittgenstein 1953; and Field\u2019s (1994a, 2001b)\ncomputational-role + indication-relations account. There is, however,\na lot of work to be done before any of these theories can be regarded\nas adequate. Devitt 2001 makes this point in rejecting all of these\nalternative approaches to meaning, claiming that the only viable\napproach is (referential/)truth-conditional semantics.\n\nWhile the orthodoxy of truth-conditional accounts of meaning adds\nweight to this challenge to deflationism, it is still, contra Devitt,\nan open question whether any non-truth-conditional account of meaning\nwill turn out to be adequate. Moreover, even if there is no viable\n\u201ctruth-free\u201d account, several philosophers (e.g., Bar-on,\net al. 2005) have argued that deflationism has no more\nproblem with a truth-conditional theory of meaning than any other\napproach to truth does. Others have gone further, arguing positively\nthat there is no incompatibility between deflationism and\ntruth-conditional theories. Alexis Burgess (2011, 407\u2013410)\nargues that at least some versions of deflationism are compatible with\nmainstream model-theoretic semantics in linguistics (understood as\nproviding explanations of truth conditions) and the recognition of\n\u201cthe manifest power and progress of truth-conditional\nsemantics\u201d. Claire Horisk (2008) argues that\n\u201ccircularity\u201d arguments for incompatibility (or, as she\nprefers, \u201cimmiscibility\u201d) fail. The only circularity\ninvolved here, she claims, is a harmless kind, so long as one is (like\nsome proponents of truth-conditional semantics) offering a reciprocal,\nrather than a reductive, analysis of meaning. Mark Lance (1997,\n186\u20137) claims that any version of deflationism based on an\nanaphoric reading of \u2018is true\u2019 (as in Brandom 1988, 1994)\nis independent of, and thus compatible with, any underlying account of\nmeaning, including a truth-conditional one. Williams 1999 likewise\nclaims that the role of truth in meaning theories for particular\nlanguages is just the expressive role that deflationists claim\nexhausts the notion of truth\u2019s function. Of course, all of these\nclaims have been contested, but they seem to show that the thesis that\ndeflationism is inconsistent with a truth-conditional theory of\nmeaning is neither a forgone conclusion nor necessarily an objection\nto deflationism, even if the thesis is correct. (For further\ndiscussion of this issue, see Gupta 1993b, Field 2005, Gupta and\nMartinez-Fernandez 2005, Patterson 2005, and Horisk 2007.) That said,\none outstanding question that remains regarding the viability of any\ndeflationary approach to truth is whether that approach can be squared\nwith an adequate account of meaning.\n",
