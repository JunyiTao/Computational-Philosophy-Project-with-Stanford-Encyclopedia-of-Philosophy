    "main_text": "Important doctrines || . Semantics of universal affirmatives\n3. Influence\n\nBacon\u2019s approbation of Sherwood is not the only explicit reference we\nhave to him by his contemporaries. The copy of Chapter Five of the\nIntroduction found in MS Worcester Cath. Q. 13 mentioned\nearlier is followed by a collection of anonymous notes (also edited in\nPinborg & Ebbesen 1984 and there called the Dubitationes).\nPinborg and Ebbesen argue that these lecture notes, composed either\nfor a teacher\u2019s or a student\u2019s use, are unlikely to have been written\nin response to lectures given in the 1290s, i.e., when the manuscript\nwas copied, but rather date from the 1260s or the 1270s, favoring a\ndate around 1270 (Pinborg and Ebbesen 1984, p. 104). This text thus\nprovides evidence that Sherwood\u2019s works continued to be taught and\ncirculated.\n\nBeyond these explicit mentions, it is clear that Sherwood\u2019s works were\nwidely influential among logicians at the University of Paris in the\nsecond half of the 13th century. The most direct line of influence\nruns from William of Sherwood to his much better-known colleague Peter\nof Spain. It was for many years believed that Peter was the first\nperson to translate Psellus\u2019s text (Mullinger 1873, p. 176), prior to\nthe rediscovery of Sherwood\u2019s Introduction, which pre-dates\nPeter by two decades and which is closer to Psellus\u2019s work. Peter\u2019s\nSummary of Logic is clearly indebted to Sherwood. Kretzmann\nnotes that \u201cmany of the features of the Summulae that\nmade it far and away the most popular logic textbook in the Middle\nAges seem quite plainly to have developed as modifications of more\ndifficult discussions and less felicitous mnemonic devices in the\nIntroductiones\u201d (Kretzmann 1968, p. 6). On the other\nhand, Sherwood appears to have been influenced by Peter\u2019s treatise on\nsyncategorematic terms in writing his own; Kretzmann provides a\nsummary of passages in Sherwood\u2019s treatise which \u201ccan be read as\nallusions to positions taken by Peter\u201d (1968, p. 7). Other\ninfluences can be found in Albert the Great, who used Sherwood\u2019s\nnotion of appellation rather than Peter of Spain\u2019s (Kretzmann 1966, p.\n5), and Thomas Aquinas, whose analysis of modal propositions follows\nSherwood (Kretzmann 1966, p. 5; Uckelman 2008).\nThough Sherwood\u2019s indirect influence on the development of logic and semantics, via his influence on Peter of Spain, should not be underestimated, his direct influence beyond the 13th century was more minimal, in part because the influence of Peter of Spain was so great.  In the 14th century, any influence Sherwood\u2019s approach to the properties of terms might have still had was almost entirely eclipsed by figures such as William of Ockham, John Buridan, and Albert of Saxony (Bos 2011, p. 773).\n",
