Given two game structures,\nwhen are they representations of the same underlying game? The answer\nis that it very much depends on what aspects one is interested in.\n\nExample The same game, or not?\n\n\n\nFigure 4.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nConsider the two game forms above. If one cares about exact sequences\nof moves or the choices players have along the way, these games are\ndifferent. The game to the left has A move first, while\nE begins in the game on the right. In the game on the right,\nA may face a choice between p and q. This cannot\nhappen on the left.\n\nCaring about exact moves as done here constitutes a fine-grained\nperspective on games. There are others. When focusing on\nplayers\u2019 powers for bringing about certain outcomes, for\ninstance, the analysis changes. In the game on the left, A has\na strategy (playing left) that ensures the game to end up in\nan outcome satisfying p, and one (playing right) that\nrestricts possible outcomes to those satisfying \\(q \\lor r\\). With\nthis second strategy, the further choice which of \\(q or r\\) gets\nrealized is left up to player E. Also the second player,\nE, has two strategies in the game on the left, one (playing\nleft) ensuring the outcome to satisfy \\(p\\lor q\\), the other\n(playing right) guaranteeing that the outcome satisfies \\(p\n\\lor r\\).\n\nPerforming the same calculations for the game on the right, virtually\nthe same player powers emerge. More precisely, A\u2019s\nuniform strategies left-left and right-right yield\np and \\(q\\lor r\\) respectively, exactly the same powers as in\nthe left game. The two remaining strategies left-right and\nright-left yield \\(p\\lor q\\) and \\(p\\lor r\\), both of which\nare mere weakenings of A\u2019s power to achieve p.\nThus, at the level of players\u2019 powers, the above two game forms\nshould be considered the same.\n\nAs this example illustrates, there are several legitimate ways of\ncomparing games. When taking a fine-grained focus on the internal\nstructure of a game, a natural candidate is the notion of a\nbisimulation (cf. Blackburn, de Rijke,\n& Venema 2001). A bisimulation \\(Z\\subseteq G_1\\times G_2\\)\nrelates states of two game forms \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) subject to four\nconditions: States m and n may only be related when\n(i) the same player is to move in m and n,\n(ii) m and n do not differ in any of their\nbasic local properties, while (iiia) whenever there is an\navailable move of type a in \\(G_1\\) leading to a state \\(m'\\),\nthere is a matching available move of type a in \\(G_2\\) leading\nto a state \\(n'\\) with \\(m'Zn'\\), and vice versa (iiib)\nwhenever there is a move in \\(G_2\\) that leads to a state \\(n'\\),\nthere there is a move of the same type in \\(G_1\\) leading to a state\n\\(m'\\) with \\(m'Zn'\\).\n\n\nExample A bisimulation between games.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nThis particular notion of bisimulation is not the only invariance that\nmakes sense for games. A more coarse-grained perspective, for\ninstance, might not distinguish moves by their particular action\ntypes, but merely by which player is to perform them. A corresponding\nbisimulation can be defined by omitting references to particular\naction types in conditions (iiia) and (iiib)\nabove.\n\nFurther notions of bisimulation take an even coarser perspective on\nthe games\u2019 move structure, for instance by allowing to contract\nzones where the same player moves several times in a row. Finally,\ndropping all information about players and their choices, games can be\ncompared by the sequences of moves they admit. This purely\nobservational notion, known as trace equivalence in\ncomputation, may, however, be less relevant in the context of games.\nAn alternative approach to coarsening focuses on the players\u2019\npowers to control outcomes, cf.\n Section 2.5\n and van Benthem, Bezhanishvili and Enqvist\n(2019a).\n\nWhile most notions of invariance discussed so far related to extensive\nform games, a similar style of analysis applies to games in strategic\nform. Van Benthem, Pacuit, and Roy\n(2011) define modal bisimulations that connect outcome states\nof different matrices, and apply bisimulation\u2019s back-and-forth\nconditions to the relevant relations of players\u2019 choice,\nfreedom, and preference.\n\nThis may be a good point to stress once more that the present section\nis concerned with game forms only, omitting any player related aspect\nsuch as preferences between outcomes. When these are added,\nidentifying appropriate notions of invariance becomes more\nchallenging, as will be discussed in\n Section 3\n below.\n\n",
