    "main_text": "Arguments Against Eliminative Materialism || Eliminativism Eliminated?\n5. Concluding Comments\n\nEliminative materialism entails unsettling consequences not just about\nour conception of the mind, but also about the nature of morality,\naction, social and legal conventions, and practically every other\naspect of human activity. As Jerry Fodor puts it, \u201cif\ncommonsense psychology were to collapse, that would be, beyond\ncomparison, the greatest intellectual catastrophe in the history of\nour species \u2026\u201d (1987, p. xii). Thus, eliminative\nmaterialism has stimulated various projects partly designed to\nvindicate ordinary mental states and establish their respectability in\na sophisticated account of the mind. For example, several projects\npursued by philosophers in recent years have attempted to provide a\nreductive account of the semantic content of propositional attitudes\nthat is entirely naturalistic (i.e., an account that only appeals to\nstraightforward causal-physical relations and properties). Much of the\nimpetus for these projects stems in part from the recognition that\neliminative materialism cannot be as easily dismissed as earlier\nwriters, like C. D. Broad, had originally assumed.\n\nOf course, some claim that these concerns are quite premature, given\nthe promissory nature of eliminative materialism. After all, a pivotal\ncomponent of the eliminativist perspective is the idea that the\ncorrect theory of the mind, once discovered by psychologists, will not\nreveal a system or structure that includes anything like common-sense\nmental states. Thus, for eliminative materialism to get off the\nground, we need to assume that scientific psychology is going to turn\nout a certain way. But why suppose that before scientific psychology\ngets there? What is the point of drawing such a drastic conclusion\nabout the nature of mentality, when a central premise needed for that\nconclusion is a long ways from being known?\n\nOne response an eliminativist might offer here would be to consider\nthe broader theoretical roles eliminative materialism can play in our\nquest for a successful theory of the mind. Various writers have\nstipulated necessary conditions that any theory of the mind must meet,\nand on some accounts these conditions include the explication of\nvarious mental states as understood by common sense. According to this\nview, if a theory doesn\u2019t include states that correspond with\nbeliefs, or provide us with some sort of account of the nature of\nconsciousness, then it needn\u2019t be taken seriously as a complete\naccount of \u201creal\u201d mental phenomena. One virtue of\neliminative materialism is that it liberates our theorizing from this\nrestrictive perspective. Thus, the relationship between eliminative\nmaterialism and science may be more reciprocal than many have assumed.\nWhile it is true that eliminative materialism depends upon the\ndevelopment of a radical scientific theory of the mind, radical\ntheorizing about the mind may itself rest upon our taking seriously\nthe possibility that our common sense perspective may be profoundly\nmistaken.\n",
