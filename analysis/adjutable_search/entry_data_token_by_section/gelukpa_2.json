    "main_text": "Unique Assertions of the Consequence School\n3. Unique Assertions of the Consequence School\n\nTsongkhapa contends that the superiority of the Consequence School to\nall other Buddhist philosophical schools is reflected in a series of\ntheses unique to this school, each of which reflects a deeper\nunderstanding of the nature of reality and cognition. We now turn to\nseveral of these. The Consequence School squarely rejects idealism:\nneither objects nor minds have a privileged status in this tradition,\nand so there is no privileged level of consciousness, and no\nself-validating awareness. While the Mind-Only school asserts that all\nthought and all appearances are grounded in a \u201cfoundational\nconsciousness\u201d (kun gzhi rnam shes) and that each\nmoment of consciousness is reflexively aware (rang rig), the\nConsequence School rejects these claims. The foundational\nconsciousness, he argues\u2014posited as a ground for sensory\nconsciousness\u2014represents a mistaken attempt by other Buddhists\nto understand personal identity, one that ends up reifying the self.\nTsongkhapa dispenses with this notion of a substrate consciousness and\nsees it as simply another reification.\n\nThe Mind-Only school is committed to the reality of a special kind of\nreflexive awareness (rang rig), by means of which the mind\nknows itself, a way that is different from the way a mind knows any\nother object. Geluk scholars deny that there is any such distinctive\nmode of reflexive awareness; the mind is simply a dependently arisen\nphenomenon, just like any other, and is known in just the way that\nother phenomena are known. Moreover, nothing appears the way it really\nis to an ordinary being (Jamyang Zhepa in Hopkins 2003, 930). For this\nreason, this philosophy does not partake in ordinary phenomenology.\nInstead, it is primarily concerned with critical ontology, or what we\ncould call a form of \u201contological deflationism,\u201d in that\nit aims to undermine the foundations of the entire ontological project\n(MacKenzie 2008, 197). Philosophers in the Geluk tradition also point\nout that the posit of reflexive awareness attributes to the mind a\nspecial status as an independently existent, self-knowing entity. Yet\na unique, first-personal access to self-awareness, being simply given\nin experience, presumes immediate access to truth. Tsongkhapa and his\nfollowers take this as a further reason to reject this view, since\naccording to those in the Geluk tradition, conventional truths are\ninterdependent, and knowledge is always mediated and contingent.\nMoreover, they argue, reflexive awareness offers no explanatory power\nin the realms of either the conventional or ultimate truth. Indeed,\nTsongkhapa argues that in the Consequence School, neither this kind of\nfoundational consciousness nor reflexive awareness are taken to exist\neven conventionally\u2014they are simply philosophical errors.\n\nTsongkhapa argues that another distinctive feature of the Consequence\nschool is its recognition of the existence of \u201cdisintegration as\nan entity\u201d (zhig pa\u2019i dngos po) to account for\ncausality (Hopkins 2003, 934\u201335). The impetus for the theory\nthat disintegration is a distinct entity is to provide an account for\ncausality in the absence of substance. Tsongkhapa argues that an\nentity\u2019s disintegration\u2014which many other Buddhist\nphilosophical systems take to be a non-entity\u2014is just as real as\nany positive entity, and so itself is as causally efficacious as any\nother entity or event. While attributing causal power to\ndisintegration is an attempt to preserve a non-substantialist theory\nof causality, this theory invites other problems, such as the\nreification of absence (i.e., treating emptiness as a\n\u201cthing\u201d), which has been a frequent target for critics of\nthe Geluk tradition.\n\nThe Geluk tradition also sees the Consequence School as offering an\nunapologetic affirmation of conventional reality, including the\nreality of the person. The Geluk tradition holds that transformation\nand liberation do not require us to deny the reality of the world, but\nrather to cease the superimposition of essences onto the entities we\nencounter and onto ourselves as subjects. This is another way of\nsaying that emptiness\u2014the absence of essence\u2014is a negation\nnot of existence per se, but rather of intrinsic\nexistence, or essence. That is, this analysis in terms of\nemptiness in a significant way leaves conventional phenomena intact,\nand merely refutes the claim that they exist ultimately.\nSignificantly, the denial of self, too, does not mean the denial of\nthe \u201cmere I\u201d (bdag tsam), or the conventionally\nexistent person (Jinpa 2002, 71). The mere I or the conventional\nperson is also accepted as conventional existent in the Geluk\ntradition. Only its reification or true existence is denied.\n",
