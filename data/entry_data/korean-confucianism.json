    "preamble": "\n\nKoreans have been key players in Asian intellectual history and have\nhistorically been great propagators of intercultural adaptation. The\n\u201cThree Teachings\u201d of China, in the form of Buddhism,\nConfucianism, and Daoism (sometimes written \u201cTaoism\u201d), had\nall made their way into Korea by the fifth century CE, blending with\nthe pre-existing institutions and culture there. Korean Confucians had\nused Confucian ideas, especially those advocating hierarchy and moral\nleadership, to bolster a powerful state bureaucracy in order to\nprovide society with a rigidly structured and organised modus\nvivendi. In this context, philosophical thought was linked with\naction, and with concrete implications for oneself, one\u2019s\nfamily, and one\u2019s state (indeed, the world). Confucians, who\nwere not particularly concerned with the spiritual life of\nindividuals, sought an organised pathway to create an ethical and\nsocially guiding discourse. Inevitably, confrontations arose between\ndifferent groups, and intellectually, they gave rise to a series of\nphilosophical debates that have shaped Korean Confucianism, especially\nduring its phase of maturation during the Chos\u014fn dynasty\n(1392\u20131910), when its recalibrated form, Neo-Confucianism,\ndisplaced Buddhism as a rival intellectual and philosophical\nsystem.\n\nThe sections below will trace the main ideas and themes of Korean\nConfucianism, with in depth examinations of several philosophical\ndebates and key philosophical ideas, while underscoring one of the\nmore salient features of Korean Confucianism, sagehood, which has\npotential for our lives now in the twenty-first century.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Initial Observations\n\nThe tradition that is known as Confucianism in the West is known as\nYuhak in Korean (\u5112\u5b78; C. Ruxue) [the\nstudy of the \u201cRu\u201d scholars], or Yugyo\n\u5112\u654e, C. Rujiao) [the teachings of the scholars].\nKorean Confucians have contributed greatly to complex metaphysical\ndiscussions relating to the moral psychology of Confucian philosophy\nand its teachings. The goal of such teachings is to become a sage\n(\u8056\u4eba, C. Shengren, K. S\u014fngin), and\nthis is a salient feature of Korean Confucianism, referring to someone\nwho studies, and who morally transforms themselves through concerted\neffort. In this sense, one\u2019s moral cultivation, known in the\nConfucian texts as \u201cself-cultivation\u201d (\u4fee\u5df1,\nC. xiuji, K. sugi), meant that humans should depend\non themselves and their own inherent abilities to solve their own\nproblems (social and personal), ruling out the need for help from gods\nor deities. This becomes evident when we read the Korean philosophical\ntexts on sagehood discussed below.\n\nThe classical texts of Confucianism, which were later edited and\nprobably re-organised by Confucius himself, are known as the Five\nClassics (\u4e94\u7d93, C. Wujing, K.\nOgy\u014fng):\n\nYijing (\u6613\u7d93) [Classic of Changes],\nShujing (\u66f8\u7d93) [Classic of History],\nShijing (\u8a69\u7d93) [Classic of Poetry],\nLiji (\u79ae\u8a18) [Records of Rites], and\nChunqiu (\u6625\u79cb) [Spring and Autumn\nAnnals].\n\n\nLater, a new body of work would be grouped into a new set of texts\ncollectively known as The Four Books (\u56db\u66f8, C.\nSishu, K. Sas\u014f), by the great Southern Song dynasty\n(1126\u20131271) scholar Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200):\n\nLunyu (\u8ad6\u8a9e) [The Analects],\nDaxue (\u5927\u5b78) [The Great Learning],\nZhongyong (\u4e2d\u5eb8) [The Doctrine of the Mean],\nand\nMengzi (\u5b5f\u5b50) [The Mencius].\n(The Daxue and\nZhongyong were originally separate chapters in the\nLiji\u2014Record of Rites. See also\n Other Internet Resources\n for more information.)\n\n\nZhu, a harsh critique of Buddhism, synthesised the later metaphysical\ndevelopments of Confucianism, known as Neo-Confucianism, and his ideas\nshaped the trajectory of Korean Neo-Confucianism. Additionally, his\ncommentaries on the Four Books (and his re-organisation and\nre-wording in some cases) were considered \u201corthodox\u201d,\nwhile other interpretations were considered heterodox. Meanwhile,\nKorean Confucians clearly debated received ideas differently than\nConfucian scholars in China, and this gives the Korean contribution to\nConfucianism even greater significance.\n\nOne\u2019s social obligations calibrated through a distinct set of\nrelationships has been extremely important for Koreans, in the past as\nwell as in the present. The \u201cFive Cardinal Relationships\u201d\n(\u4e94\u502b, C. wulun, K. oryun) of\nConfucianism, where each relationship was related to a particular\nvirtue, are emphasised in Mencius:\n\n\nbetween father and son there should be affection; between ruler and\nminister there should be righteousness; between husband and wife there\nshould be attention to their separate functions; between old and young\nthere should be proper order; and between friends there should be\nfaithfulness. (3A:4; translated SB-Chan: 69\u201370)\n\n\nIn the Korean Confucian tradition, social position and age have\nimportant implications for maintaining social hierarchies, and women\nwere particularly disadvantaged through interpretations of these\nrelationships, expected always to be subordinate to men: fathers,\nhusbands and sons (see Cawley 2018). Adhering to these clearly\ndelineated relationships was associated with a well-functioning\n\u201charmonious\u201d society, whereby harmony was achieved through\nfulfilling one\u2019s specific role. Nevertheless, the\n\u201csuperior\u201d person in these relationships should\nbe a morally and socially responsible individual, especially the king,\nwho also has obligations to the population he governs, a theme that is\nrecurrent in the literature on \u201cSage Learning\u201d\n(\u8056\u5b78, C. shengxue, K. s\u014fnghak),\nthat shapes and defines Korean Neo-Confucianism. The other\nrelationship, emphasised much more in Korea than in China, is the idea\nof filial piety (\u5b5d, C. xiao, K. hyo).\nHyo remains one of the defining features of Korean\nConfucianism, where respect for one\u2019s parents and elders is\nstill emphasised. The eldest male is the most respected person in the\nfamily, which also highlights the gender bias that Confucianism has\nfacilitated on the peninsula, something that is contentious today in a\nKorea that is heavily debating this gender imbalance, gaining traction\nthanks to the #MeToo movement.\n\nRitual propriety (\u79ae, C. li, K. ye), or the\nuse of rituals a mechanism for ordering society, is something still\nprevalent in rituals related towards ancestors, known as\nchesa (\u796d\u7940, C. jisi) in Korea, which\nare still conducted by many Korean families. They, however, further\nreinforce other social norms related to patrilineality and the place\nof privilege for the eldest son, while preventing women from\nperforming these rituals. Naoaki Hiraishi (2003: 187) underscores the\nimportant function of rituals in society, noting their refining\ninfluence, and how they have\n\n\nthe advantage of inculcating people with social norms rather than\n[\u2026] social ordering with criminal law and other physical\npunishment.\n\n\nThe refining nature of moral education is another important feature of\nKorean Confucianism, something scholars asserted and accentuated, and\neven the king was indoctrinated with formal Confucian training with\nlectures on conformist Confucian morality (see Sohn 2000: ch. 1).\nKorean Confucians agreed with the Mencian tradition of education,\nshaped by the view of \u201chuman nature\u201d (\u6027, C.\nxing, K. s\u014fng) as something inherently good,\nwhereby education was a vehicle to refine and promote one\u2019s\nvirtuous nature. In relation to Korean Confucianism, it is not an\nunderstatement to say that Mencius\u2019 ideas became responsible for\na great deal of Chos\u014fn\u2019s metaphysical stimulation and\nrecalibration, while also ultimately leading to its philosophical\ndebates.\n2. Neo-Confucian Metaphysical Recalibration\n2.1 Principle, Human Nature, and Material Force\n\nEarlier Confucian scholars lacked a sophisticated metaphysical and\ncosmological basis for their ethical codes, and so were motivated to\n\u201coffer a cosmology that could compete with the Buddhists\u201d\n(Creel 1971: 205). This would eventually lead to the development of\nNeo-Confucianism, which had already permeated Korea by the end of the\nKory\u014f dynasty (918\u20131392), when discussions on human nature\n(K. s\u014fng) were starting to be discussed in great detail.\nThe Chinese scholar Han Yu (768\u2013824) initiated the resurgence of\ninterest in Confucianism, especially the ideas of Mencius, evident in\nAn Inquiry on Human Nature, while at the same time rejecting\nBuddhism. These ideas that would make their way into Korean diatribes\nagainst Buddhism, also propelling them towards debates about human\nnature (SB-Chan: 452\u2013455; SB-BB: 583\u2013585). One of Han\nYu\u2019s disciples, Li Ao (died ca. 844), also wrote on Mencian\nideas in Returning to the Nature, focusing on how to become a\nsage: a theme that would be developed by Koreans to a much more\nsophisticated degree during the Chos\u014fn dynasty (see Fung 1937\n[1983: 413\u2013415]). However, his writings are indebted to Buddhist\nideas about the recovery of one\u2019s inherent good nature or Buddha\nNature (\u4f5b\u6027, C. foxing, K.\nbuls\u014fng), influential at that time, although he\nreorients them to advocate Confucian sagehood, especially important\nfor Korean Confucianism.\n\nNeo-Confucianism can be traced to the writings of \u201cThe Five\nSages of Song\u201d: Shao Yong (1011\u20131077), Zhou Dunyi\n(1017\u20131073), Zhang Zai (1020\u20131077), and two brothers,\nCheng Hao (1032\u20131085) and Cheng Yi (1033\u20131107). However,\ntheir main ideas were recognised and appreciated\n\n\nonly later when their various contributions were synthesised by the\nimpressive scholar Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200),\n\n\nparticularly the ideas of the Cheng brothers (Fairbank & Goldman\n1999: 98). Ames and Rosemont (1998: 17) highlight how\n\n\nZhu Xi\u2019s commentaries [\u2026] became the definitive of the\n[Neo-Confucian] tradition from the early fourteenth century through\nthe twentieth centuries,\n\n\nand this influence also extended to Korea, becoming deeply rooted\nthere. Zhu\u2019s compendium on Neo-Confucian thought,\nJinsilu (\u8fd1\u601d\u9304) [Reflections on Things at\nHand], written with Lu Zu-qian (1137\u20131181), became the handbook\non this great philosophical synthesis, and was integral to the Korean\ndevelopment of those ideas. Zhu focused on self-cultivation, a\nnecessary ingredient in Confucian sagehood that became central to\nKorean\u2019s interpretation of those ideas (Chan 1987:\n122\u2013124; Tillman 1992: 114\u2013118).\n\nHowever, it was Zhu\u2019s adaptation of the Cheng brother\u2019s\nideas on Principle (\uf9e4, C. li, K. i)\nthat governed its reception in Korea (where Principle in\nitalics is used to distinguish this key Neo-Confucian term from\nWestern interpretations of the word). Principle was\nconsidered to be an original ideal governing source of all principles\nof reality in the world, where everything has its own individual\nprinciple that is a part of this greater immaterial and universally\norganising Principle. Cheng Yi even insisted that\nPrinciple is one but its manifestations (or sub-principles)\nare many, while underscoring that it reached its zenith in humans,\nespecially in the human mind, which was endowed with its\n\u201cgood\u201d human nature (SB-Chan: 544). In Korea,\nNeo-Confucianism is generally referred to as the School of\nPrinciple (\uf9e4\u5b78, K. ihak), or School of\nthe Principle and Human Nature (\u6027\uf9e4\u5b78, K.\ns\u014fngnihak), highlighting the interest in metaphysics\nthat was examined by the Korean scholars to a whole new microcosmic\nlevel (Keum 1980 [2000]; Kang 2003 [2006]).\n\nWhile Zhu had given primacy to Principle, at the same time he\nrecognised it as intertwined with the material force:\n\n\nFundamentally [Principle] and material force cannot be spoken\nof as prior or posterior. But if we trace their origin, we are obliged\nto say that [Principle] is prior. (SB-Chan: 634)\n\n\nThis stance was initially adapted by the majority of Neo-Confucian\nscholars in Korea, and developed by Kw\u014fn K\u016dn\n(1352\u20131409), who \u201chad the most sophisticated understanding\nof Neo-Confucian metaphysics\u201d in the fourteenth century,\nespecially his Diagrammatic Treatises for the Commencement of\nLearning (\u5165\u5b78\u5716\u8aaa, K. Iphak\ntos\u014fl), which consisted of some\n\n\nforty diagrams and explanations designed to help beginners grasp the\nfundamentals of [Human] Nature and Principle Learning.\n(SB-Lee: 449\u2013450)\n\n\nThese diagrammatic expositions reflect an important dimension of the\nKorean Neo-Confucian tradition, to use diagrams to explain complex\nmetaphysical ideas and how they related to moral psychology embedded\nwithin the mind. Kw\u014fn wrote that\n\n\n[Principle] is the fundamental basis of the mind and material\nforce. Therefore, [Principle] precedes Material Force,\n\n\nwhich allows him to uphold the idea that human nature is good, because\nPrinciple is good, and that what is not good is due to the\nmaterial force (see Choi M.-H. 1980: 37\u201338; slightly adapted\ntranslation). Furthermore, he was the first Neo-Confucian scholar in\nKorea to discuss Principle and material force in relation to\nthe human mind linked with the \u201cfour beginnings\u201d, and the\n\u201cseven feelings\u201d: The \u201cfour beginnings\u201d are\nreferred to by Mencius (2A:6; see SB-Chan: 65): the feeling\n[(\u60c5, C. qing, K. ch\u014fng)] of\ncommiseration, shame and dislike, deference and compliance, and the\nfeeling of right and wrong, which when developed lead to the cardinal\nvirtues of Confucianism (humanity, righteousness, propriety and\nwisdom). Humanity (\u4ec1, C. ren (sometimes jen),\nK. in) was seen as the greatest Confucian virtue, often\ntranslated as benevolence or kind-heartedness. The \u201cseven\nfeelings\u201d are referred to in the ninth chapter of the Book\nof Rites: joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, dislike and liking.\nKw\u014fn linked the four beginnings (which were always good) with\nPrinciple, and the seven feelings (which could be potentially\nbad) with the material force, starting a veritable meta-psychological\nchain reaction that continues until today. These ideas were\nconsolidated in his \u201cDiagram of the Unity and Oneness\nof Heaven, Human Beings, Mind, and Human Nature\u201d\n(\u5929\u4eba\u5fc3\u6027\u5408\u4e00\u4e4b\u5716, K.\nCh\u2019\u014fnin sims\u014fng habil-to), and in\nKw\u014fn\u2019s view \u201cHeaven\u201d referred to the working of\nPrinciple in all things, including the human mind, and so\n(wo)man\u2019s mind was linked to the moral Principle of the\nuniverse, embodied by the sage (see Halla Kim 2017: 1\u201323).\n\nFurther complicating the intellectual impetus of Korean Confucianism\nwas its reaction to (or rather against) Sinitic Chan meditational\ndevelopments that shaped the S\u014fn school in Korea. Korean S\u014fn\nideas had arguably reached their maturity in the teachings of the\nKory\u014f monk Chinul (1158\u20131210), especially his text On\nCultivating the Mind (\u4fee\u5fc3\u8a23, K. Susim\nky\u014fl). Chinul\u2019s approach recognises the mind as the\nessence (\u9ad4, K. che) of one\u2019s Buddha Nature,\nwhich requires continual practice and cultivation aids to refine its\nfunction (\u7528 K. yong), bringing together the important\nessence-function (che-yong) feature of Korea\u2019s Buddhist\ntradition, which would deeply influence the Neo-Confucian thought of\nChos\u014fn. The S\u014fn practice of seated meditation would also\nshape Neo-Confucianism\u2019s own mind-focused concept of\n\u201cquiet-sitting\u201d (\u975c\u5750; C. jingzuo, K.\nch\u014fngjwa), also known as ch\u014fngjwa chonsim\n(\u975c\u5750\u5b58\u5fc3): to sit quietly and preserve the\nmind (Palais 1996: 181).\n2.2 Neo-Confucianism and Social Transformation\n\nAn Hyang (1243\u20131306) was one of the most important Korean\nscholars responsible for introducing Neo-Confucian ideas into the\nKorean peninsula, he \u201ccopied [Confucian Classics] by hand, drew\n(Zhu Xi\u2019s) likeness and brought them back home\u201d (Deuchler\n1992: 17). Paek I-j\u014fng (1247\u20131323) and other Korean\nscholars also helped transmit the new philosophy to Korea as they\nbecame acquainted with many Chinese Neo-Confucian scholars, including\nthe direct successors of the Cheng-Zhu tradition, who met at the\nMan\u2019gw\u014fndang library (the hall of ten thousand scrolls)\nfounded by King Ch\u2019ungs\u014fn (1308\u20131313) in the Mongol\ncapital of the Yuan empire (Deuchler 1992: 19). Furthermore, Yi\nChe-hy\u014fn (1287\u20131367) endorsed the printing of The Four\nBooks and believed that a king should indeed be a\n\u201csage\u201d and interpreted the relationship between government\nand Neo-Confucianism as essential. Yi Saek (1328\u20131396), son of\nYi Che-hy\u014fn, was responsible for the dissemination of the texts\nin Korea where Neo-Confucian prestige was increasing rapidly, and he\nwas \u201cappointed educational intendant for the Yuan in\nKorea\u201d (De Bary & Haboush 1985b: 41). Hence,\nNeo-Confucianism was linked to education and governing the state,\nwhile shaped by a moral code of ethics.\n\nThese revitalised Confucian ethics would redefine the moral guiding\ndiscourse of the emerging Chos\u014fn dynasty (1392\u20131910).\nCh\u014fng Toj\u014fn (1342\u20131398), who helped to validate the\nnew kingship, instigated a rejuvenation of Confucian morality, that\nwould culminate in a renewal of society through the use of propriety,\nmanifest in specific rites (K. ye) (Deuchler 2004: 46). Lee\nSang-wha (2005) draws attention to the remodeling of patriarchal\npatterns of behaviour, validated through the metaphysics of the Yin,\nor \u016cm in Korean (as weak) and Yang (as strong), linked\nto the social functions of women (as passive) and men (as active),\nalso inculcated through the study of detailed ritual sourcebooks,\nespecially Zhuzi jiali (\u6731\u5b50\u5bb6\u79ae)\n[Zhu Xi\u2019s Family Rites], which linked personal self-discipline\nwith the cultivation of the mind through the rigid application of\npropriety. In the Korean context, propriety was embodied by four\nspecific rites that were to be put into practice to reorganise\nsociety: coming of age (also known as capping), wedding, mourning, and\nmost importantly, ancestral rites (Deuchler 1992: 108\u2013111). In\nKorea, rites were made a legal requirement and even encoded into the\nnational \u201cGrand Code for State Administration\u201d, known as\nthe Ky\u014fngguk taej\u014fn\n(\u7d93\u570b\u5927\u5178), first promulgated in the late\nfifteenth century. Failure to perform the prescribed rituals could\nlead to physical punishment, imprisonment, and even death (as would be\nthe case for thousands of Catholics during the nineteenth century).\nThese laws asserted and ingrained a newly prescribed Neo-Confucian\ncultural order into the social matrix, that suppressed and repressed\nany challenges to its authority, including Buddhism.\n3. Korea\u2019s Neo-Confucian Confrontation with Buddhism\n3.1 Early Criticisms of Buddhism\n\nOne of the first Confucian texts critical of the Buddhists was that of\nPaek Munbo (1303\u20131374), Ch\u2019\u014fkpulso\n(\u65a5\u4f5b\u758f) [In Rejection of Buddhism], which\nused Shao Yong\u2019s Daoist-inspired cyclical cosmological\nphilosophy to ratiocinate that it was again time for restoration of\nthe \u201cway\u201d of the sage Confucian rulers Yao and Shun\n(Deuchler 1992: 23). Kang (2003 [2006: 158\u2013164]) outlines the\nopposition to Buddhism towards the end of the Kory\u014f period,\nespecially among Confucian scholars such as Ch\u014fng Mongju\n(1337\u20131392) and Ch\u014fng Toj\u014fn. Ch\u014fng Mongju\nemphasised the practical \u201ceveryday life\u201d of the Confucians\nwho fulfilled social and sexual relations unlike the Buddhists who\n\n\npart with relatives, denounce the relationship between man and woman\n[\u2026] and revere the search for emptiness and Nirvana. (Kang 2003\n[2006: 160\u2013161])\n\n\nHe also was noted for his loyalty to last king of the Kory\u014f,\nwhich would cost him his life: this was how seriously Confucian\nphilosophers were dedicated to the moral principles they wrote\nabout\u2014ideas they were expected to practice in their lives. It\nwas Ch\u014fng Toj\u014fn, the \u201cgodfather\u201d of early\nChos\u014fn Neo-Confucianism, who had helped General Yi S\u014fnggye\n(1335\u20131408) to form a military alliance with other powerful\nNeo-Confucian scholars following Yi\u2019s decision to oust the last\nKory\u014f king from power in 1388, soon establishing the Chos\u014fn\ndynasty. Neo-Confucianism became the guiding socio-political ideology\nof Chos\u014fn with Ch\u014fng Toj\u014fn at the helm as its chief\narchitect, benefiting from military support and royal authority to\ncarry out his grand scheme (E. Chung 1995: 59). From the point of view\nof intellectual history, Ch\u014fng played a major role in the attempt\nto discredit and marginalise Buddhism, and Kw\u014fn K\u016dn (quoted\nin Deuchler 1992: 101 [Sambong-jib: 286]), commented on how\nCh\u014fng aspired to make\n\n\nthe elucidation of the Learning of the Way [Neo-Confucianism] and the\nrepulsion of heterodox teachings [i.e., Buddhism] his own\nresponsibility.\n\n\nConfucian philosophy was then used to undermine Buddhism during this\nearly stage of its development in Korea.\n3.2 Ch\u014fng Toj\u014fn\u2019s Neo-Confucian Critique of Buddhism\n\nCh\u014fng Toj\u014fn\u2019s arguments against Buddhism are\nencapsulated in his final treatise Pulssi Chappy\u014fn\n(\u4f5b\u6c0f\u96dc\u8fa8) [Array of Critiques of Mr.\nBuddha], while his shorter text, Simgiri\np\u2019y\u014fn (\u5fc3\u6c23\u7406\u7bc7) [On Mind,\nMaterial Force and Principle], also critiques the Buddhists and\nDaoists. Both texts have been translated and annotated along with the\noriginal Chinese characters by A. Charles Muller (2015) in\nKorea\u2019s Great Buddhist-Confucian Debate, as well as the\nrebuttal of Hamh\u01d2 Kihwa (1376\u20131433), an erudite Confucian\ntrained Buddhist, in his treatise entitled\nHy\u01d2nj\u01d2ng-non (\u986f\u6b63\u8ad6) [The\nExposition of the Correct].\n\nCh\u014fng, while investigating the phenomenological issues concerning\nhuman nature and their ethical implications, was completely unwilling\nto acknowledge any conceptual dependence on Buddhist doctrines, while\nreinforcing the staunch position of Neo-Confucians in Korea to link\nphilosophical principles to one\u2019s social reality (see Muller\n2015: introduction). For Confucians, Buddhists had cut themselves off\nfrom both social and filial obligations. His ideas, therefore,\n\u201cprovide grounded guidelines for individuals as social beings\nwho faced daily challenges\u201d and this is exemplified by the\nrecent translation of his writings as Seeking Order in a\nTumultuous Age (Robinson (trans.) 2016: here 5). These writings\nreflect the need to help the people, as well as the need to rectify\nthe mind of the ruler, but also the obligation to rectify oneself\nbefore trying to rectify others (Robinson (trans.) 2016:\n128\u2013129). They also recount the practical reasons behind his\nphilosophical attack of Buddhism:\n\n\nthe bulk of the Finance Commission is spent on Buddhism and deities.\nThere is no greater waste of fiscal resources. (trans. in Robinson\n2016: 53)\n\n\nThese are ideas that later scholars might refer to as \u201cpractical\nlearning\u201d or Sirhak, often described as a trend that\nemerged after the Hideyoshi invasions of the late sixteenth century,\nyet here we have very practical guidance from Ch\u014fng at the start\nof the Chos\u014fn dynasty, or rather the beginnings of a practical\nform of \u201csage\u201d learning applied to issues directly related\nto daily life.\n\nCh\u014fng\u2019s shorter rebuttal of Buddhism, On Mind, Material\nForce and Principle (Simgiri p\u2019y\u014fn:\n45\u201353), already highlights this intellectual nexus which\ndominates Neo-Confucianism in Korea. It introduces the main\nmetaphysical issues that were of great importance in Korea at this\ntime, namely, the mind (\u5fc3; also referred to in literature as\nthe heart-and-mind), the material force (\u6c23), and of course\nPrinciple (\u7406), which he describes as \u201cthe\ninherent virtue of the mind and that through which material force is\nproduced\u201d, and clearly states that \u201conly after there is\nprinciple is there material force\u201d (Simgiri\np\u2019y\u014fn: 50). He discusses what he considers to be the\nmisinterpretation and application of ideas in the teachings of the\nBuddhists and Daoists, vindicating his rebuttal with quotes from the\nMencius, the Analects, and the writings of Zhu Xi,\nas well as the Book of Rites. Ch\u014fng\u2019s arguments\nculminate in a radical espousal of Confucianism as an exclusivistic\ndiscourse, and he lauds the practical and direct social implications\nof these metaphysical ideas, juxtaposed to Buddhist and Daoist\nemphasis on emptiness and vacuity, which he considers to be devoid of\nmeaning when related to matters of the mundane world (Simgiri\np\u2019y\u014fn: 53). The philosophical implications of\nCh\u014fng\u2019s ideas are related to this-worldly affairs and not\nspeculative spiritual proclivities of other traditions, which he\nsuggests depended on deities who could then reward or punish.\nCh\u014fng asserts the need to investigate one\u2019s human nature\nand the mind for oneself, and not to rely on teachings that call upon\nspirits to do so, advocating the Confucian practice of preserving what\nis good in the mind and nourishing the material force to control\nbodily desires through proper Confucian education (Simgiri\np\u2019y\u014fn: 51). This bifocal approach would become greatly\nelucidated by later Neo-Confucian philosophers who would advocate an\napproach to fully develop the humanity (K. in) that our minds\nwere \u201cnaturally\u201d endowed with by Principle.\n\nCh\u014fng\u2019s Pulssi Chappy\u014fn is translated by\nMuller (2015) under the title An Array of Critiques of\nBuddhism. The text lists 19 critiques, which Ch\u014fng\nsystematically treats in turn, including important Buddhist doctrines,\nsuch as transmigration and karma. The goal of Confucianism, being\nfirmly focused on this life, was not interested in idle speculation\nabout an afterlife. Initially, Ch\u014fng (Pulssi\nChappy\u014fn: 59\u201361) sets out to critique the Buddhists\ninterpretations of the mind (K. sim), and human nature (K.\ns\u014fng), and criticises the Kory\u014f monk Chinul of\n\u201cnebulous supposition\u201d, lacking \u201chard facts\u201d,\naccusing Buddhists of \u201cword play\u201d, while lacking a\ndefinitive doctrine. Ch\u014fng explains that the Confucians consider\nthe mind to be made of the material force that \u201cone takes from\nheaven at birth\u201d, while the mind itself is endowed by\none\u2019s human nature through Principle at birth\n(Pulssi Chappy\u014fn: 59). He reinforces the\n\u201cconcrete\u201d aspect of the \u201cfunction\u201d of\nConfucianism in reality, which the Buddhists consider completely\nillusory, and refers to Cheng Yi\u2019s dictum,\n\n\nThe study of the Buddhists includes reverence to correct the internal,\nbut does not include justice to straighten the external. (Pulssi\nChappy\u014fn: 63)\n\n\nCheng Hao had similarly added that \u201cThe Buddhist way of internal\nand external life is incomplete\u201d (SB-Chan: 538). This Confucian\nrationale underpins Ch\u014fng\u2019s arguments in his\n\u201cCritique of the Buddhists\u2019 Abandonment of the Basic Human\nRelationships\u201d and the \u201cBuddhist Notion of\nCompassion\u201d, initiating his discourse (Pulssi\nChappy\u014fn: 64\u201367) on the Confucian virtue of humanity\n(K. in), which functions through social interactions,\nmanifested through \u201cThe Five Relationships\u201d. Furthermore,\nCh\u014fng denounces Buddhists for rejecting filial piety, adding that\nthey \u201cregard their most intimate family members like passers-by\non the street\u201d, despite having inherited their material force\nfrom their parents, illustrating how Neo-Confucians now used\nmetaphysics to validate their moral \u201creality\u201d (Pulssi\nChappy\u014fn: 66).\n\nAs Buddhists could take refuge in the Buddha, thereby rely on\nsomething external, the point is excoriated by Ch\u01d2ng in his\ncritique of S\u014fn Buddhists and their teachings (Pulssi\nChappy\u014fn: 72\u201373), who he insinuates,\n\n\ntook nothingness [\u7a7a, K. kong; this was the translation\nof the Sanskrit term \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101] as their cardinal\nteaching and abandoned the obligations of society,\n\n\ncontrasting it greatly with the practical \u201cway\u201d of\nConfucianism, further emphasised in his, \u201cCritique of the\nEquivalence and Differences between Confucianism and Buddhism\u201d\n(Pulssi Chappy\u014fn: 73\u201377). Ch\u014fng accuses\nBuddhists of being \u201cmasters of glibness, lewdness, trickiness,\nand evasiveness\u201d (Pulssi Chappy\u014fn: 77). In\ncontrast, the role of the Confucian \u201csage\u201d is also acutely\nheralded as a pragmatic pathway that has use for governing, to plan\nfor the welfare of the people and to \u201cavoid activities that\nwould bring harm to [them]\u201d, ideas that are also emphasised in\nhis practical handbook for governance, Seeking Order in a\nTumultuous Age, discussed above (Robinson (trans.) 2016: 81).\n\nCh\u014fng\u2019s text draws together multiple quotes by renowned\nConfucian scholars to fuel his arguments and support his overall view\nthat Buddhism had no practical social worth. As Muller (1999: 185)\nunderscores, such ideas were closely linked to the Confucian\nunderstanding that \u201cBuddhists regarded existence as illusory and\nthat only mind was real\u201d, hence they \u201cscorned human\nrelationships\u201d, while \u201conly quiet meditative inner\ncultivation was valued\u201d. The most important retort to this\ndiatribe would come from the monk Hamh\u01d2 Kihwa, who skillfully\ncounter-charges Ch\u014fng\u2019s caustic attack using Confucian\nideas and texts, while encouraging a much more inclusivistic, hence\nless divisive, approach. Kihwa (Hy\u01d2nj\u01d2ng-non:\n110\u2013111), argued for the \u201cunity of the Three\nTeachings\u201d, giving a valid piece of advice about what not to do\nthat is useful for us to hear today:\n\n\nHolding stubbornly onto one\u2019s own opinion while ignoring the\npositions of others, arbitrarily affirming this and rejecting\nthat.\n\n4. Sage Learning and The Four-Seven Debate\n\nTwo of the most preeminent scholars of the first half of the\nChos\u014fn dynasty, Yi Hwang (1501\u20131570), well known by his pen\nname T\u2019oegye, and Yi I (1536\u20131584), known by the pen name\nYulgok, are responsible for the deep level of metaphysical debates\nthat would mark Neo-Confucianism in Korea. Both would engage in\nattempts to analyse the macrocosmic Principle and its\nmicrocosmic interactions with material force (K. ki). More\nimportantly, they would initiate an intricate debate about what these\ninteractions meant for our minds and human nature, as actualised\nthrough our thoughts and actions, linked with a sense of psychological\nand social urgency. Korea\u2019s Neo-Confucian scholars propounded a\nsocial guiding discourse that is humanistic in essence (drawing on the\nConfucian in), reflected in how we are linked externally\n(through conduct) and internally (through thought). Sagehood itself is\nachieved through learning, or rather, \u201cSage Learning\u201d, a\nterm underscored by Oh Kangnam (1993: 313) as \u201cone of the\nessential components, if not the essence, of Korean Confucianism\n[\u2026]\u201d, adding that \u201cNeo-Confucianism\u2019s\nhallmark was its emphasis on sage-learning\u201d.\n\nBoth T\u2019oegye and Yulgok both wrote very specific texts on\nSagehood. In 1568, T\u2019oegye wrote S\u014fnghak sipto\n\u8056\u5b78\u5341\u5716 (The Ten Diagrams on Sage Learning),\nand in 1575 Yulgok wrote S\u014fnghak chipyo\n\u8056\u5b78\u8f2f\u8981 (Essentials of the Learning of the\nSages). According to Keum Jang-tae (1980 [2000: 40]), author of\nConfucianism and Korean Thoughts, these texts (the Ten\nDiagrams and the Essentials) reflect \u201cthe two main\nclassical works epitomizing Neo-Confucian learning in the Chos\u014fn\nera\u201d. They also embody the development of Korea\u2019s\nNeo-Confucian tradition. Kim Yung Sik (2017: 25) suggests that\n\n\nthe full understanding of [Zhu\u2019s thought] seems to have come\nquite late, only after Yi Hwang [\u2026] launched an all-out effort\nto come to grips with the entire scope of the Zhu Xi Learning.\n\n\nIn fact, Japanese Neo-Confucian scholars, such as Yamazaki Ansai\n(1618\u201382), considered T\u2019oegye to be \u201cthe greatest\nConfucian in Korea\u201d, even suggesting he was on a par with Zhu Xi\nhimself (Pak 1983: 69).\n\nT\u2019oegye\u2019s Ten Diagrams represents the finest\nsynthesis of this Neo-Confucian thought current in Korea at that time,\nand it was one of the most reproduced texts of the entire Chos\u014fn\ndynasty, overshadowing Yulgok\u2019s text. T\u2019oegye\u2019s text\nconsists of a collection of diagrams by Neo-Confucian scholars from\nChina and Korea, including three by T\u2019oegye himself, that\nelucidate Zhu Xi\u2019s main teachings, as well as\nT\u2019oegye\u2019s own synthesis and analysis of them, especially\nthrough his focus on the mind (K. sim), though guided by a\nmethodological approach that focuses on Ky\u014fng\n(\u656c). Ky\u014fng is often translated as seriousness,\nbut T\u2019oegye has reoriented this term\u2019s use, underscoring\nthe mind\u2019s mastery over one\u2019s thoughts and actions,\nleading Michael Kalton (1985: 212\u2013214) to translate it as\n\u201cmindfulness\u201d, while Kim Hyoungchan (2018: 27\u201332)\nuses the term \u201creverent mindfulness\u201d. Mindfulness, in this\nvery Confucian re-appropriation of a Buddhist concept, reflects\nT\u2019oegye\u2019s approach to sagehood: the daily practice of\nconstantly being aware of the mind, controlling its impulses so that\ngood thoughts can lead to good actions.\n\nThe first two diagrams reflect the underpinnings of Neo-Confucian\nontologico-cosmology:\n\nZhou Dunyi\u2019s Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate\n(\u592a\u6975\u4e4b\u5716, K. T\u2019aeg\u016dk\nchido), and\nZhang Zai\u2019s Western Inscription\n(\u897f\u9298\u5716, K. S\u014fmy\u014fngdo)\n(see\n Kalton\u2019s translations online).\n\n\nThey provide us with a clear outline of the interconnected\nNeo-Confucian vision of a morally interconnected universe. While the\nfirst diagram identifies the Supreme Ultimate\n(T\u2019aeg\u016dk) as Principle, which generates\nyin and yang, which then materialise through the Five Elements, the\nsecond diagram further concretises this organising aspect of the\ngreater originating Principle in the material world, showing\nits inherent order that inscribes itself hierarchically.\nPrinciple is reflected in all things, and therefore used to\nvalidate human social relations and the distinctions that exist\nbetween ruler and subjects, older and younger for example. The next\nthree diagrams are all concerned with the basic underpinnings of\nConfucian moral humanistic education: The Diagram of Elementary\nLearning, the Diagram of the Great Learning, and the\nDiagram of Rules of the White Deer Hollow Academy, the latter\nbeing the rules of Zhu Xi\u2019s own retreat centre for learning.\nThis education embodies Confucian morality which is the basis for\nunderstanding more complex issues of the mind and human nature.\nThe Elementary Learning is an original diagram by\nT\u2019oegye himself based on Zhu Xi\u2019s text of the same name,\nwhich was widely studied in Korea in its own right. Meanwhile, the\nDiagram of the Great Learning was by Kw\u014fn K\u016dn,\nappearing in his collection of diagrams mentioned above, bolstering\nthe importance of moral education within the Korean Neo-Confucian\ntradition.\n\nIt is the sixth diagram in T\u2019oegye\u2019s collection where we\nfind his view of the \u201cFour-Seven\u201d issue that was first\nmentioned by Kw\u014fn K\u016dn, but which really addressed the\nquestions: if human nature is completely good\u2014why do people do\nthings that are \u201cnot good\u201d and how/why are there negative\nfeelings? Is this due to Principle or the material force?\nThis was a conundrum for Neo-Confucians just as good and evil was for\nthe Scholastics in Europe trying to explain why there was evil if\ntheir God was good. Michael Kalton (1985: 119) describes the\nsubsequent debate, outlined below, as \u201cthe single most important\nintellectual controversy of the Yi dynasty\u201d, ultimately related\nto the different roles of Principle and material force, their\ninteractions and significance in regard to one\u2019s human nature\nand the mind. T\u2019oegye\u2019s sixth diagram is actually divided\ninto three parts, relating to the saying The Mind Combines and\nGoverns the Nature and the Feelings\n(\u5fc3\u7d71\u6027\u60c5\u5716) and they describe different\nbut interrelated aspects of the mind:\n\n\u201cthe not yet aroused state\u201d (\u672a\u767c, K.\nmibal), linked to the four beginnings, and pure\nPrinciple, and\nthe seven feelings linked to \u201cthe aroused state\u201d\n(\u5df2\u767c, K. ibal) when Principle interacts\nwith the material force.\n\n\nIn this instance, both Principle and material force\ninterpenetrate each other, but this was not T\u2019oegye\u2019s\ninitial interpretation, which had changed due to his\n\u201cFour-Seven\u201d debate with another scholar.\n\nThe \u201cFour-Seven\u201d debate (which was clearly deeply related\nto Principle and material force) originated from a series of\ncorrespondences between T\u2019oegye and Kobong, penname of Ki\nTaes\u016dng (1527\u20131572), and later it was continued on between\nYulgok and Ugye, penname of S\u014fng Hon (1536\u20131598).\nT\u2019oegye originally suggested that the four beginnings and seven\nfeelings had different origins, and this instigated the original\ndebate with Kobong, who did not agree with T\u2019oegye\u2019s\ndualistic approach: that Principle (i) was the\nsource of the four beginnings, while the material force was the source\nof the seven feelings. Kobong was more interested in\nki\u2019s moral and activating function, and considered\ni and ki as inseparable, especially when it came to\n\u201ctheir presence in actual things\u201d (Kalton 1994: 6). The\nissue at hand was how could the morally good Principle,\nmanifested to its highest form in (wo)mankind, be corrupt, or led\nastray, in the sense that people clearly do not always conduct\nthemselves in a kind-hearted manner towards others. Though\nT\u2019oegye revised his view, he still gave primacy to\nPrinciple and maintained that it always initially preceded\nki when we act morally, or rather that Principle\nguided ki, like a rider guiding a horse. Hence, T\u2019oegye\nupheld the moralistic perfection and integrity of Principle\nby suggesting that things could be less than perfect, and human\nbehaviour sometimes not good, as a result of the interaction with the\nmaterial force, which could be affected/corrupted depending on the\nconcrete circumstances of its actualisation in concrete\nform/action.\n\nFor T\u2019oegye Principle had been equated with the Supreme\nUltimate, and thus represented the source of the possibility for all\nexistence, whereby the very Principle (or potential) of a\nthing preceded its actual realisation, which would then interact with\nki. In this sense, the potential for life in the universe\npredated the actualisation of that life. T\u2019oegye suggests\nsomething quite idealistic: that Principle leads with what I\ndescribe as the \u201cpossibility for actualisation\u201d,\nwhile its interaction with ki enables the\n\u201cactualisation of the possibility\u201d. The\npossibility for actualisation was always \u201cperfect\u201d, but\nthe individual ki, in his opinion, could fluctuate and so\ndoes not always \u201cfunction\u201d to the optimum level of its\ninherent Principle (or potential). Let us consider this in\nterms of sexual reproduction to clarify this point: when a man and\nwoman mate (or using other medical techniques), there is the potential\nthat an egg will be fertilised by a sperm, and if so, given that the\nphysical conditions are optimum, a woman will carry a baby to term.\nHowever, sometimes there can be biological (material) issues that may\nprevent the woman from even getting pregnant (due to fertility issues\nwith the man or woman) or from carrying the baby to term.\nAdditionally, the baby may not always develop as healthily as\ntheoretically expected, which is not related to the Principle\n(i.e., that the fertilisation process itself produces a healthy baby),\nbut rather the actualisation of potential genetic codes that can\ndetermine physical and biological outcomes: hence, it is ki\nthat we inherit from our parents, and not their Principle. In\nrelation to the mind, T\u2019oegye referred to the mind of Dao, a\npure form, as well as the human mind, where less than perfect thoughts\ncould lead to less than perfect actions. However, one could use\nmindfulness as a way to guide our inner good nature to reflect the\nmind of Dao where Principle took control to divert us from\ndesires and negative feelings.\n\nContrary to T\u2019oegye and Ugye, Yulgok posited that ki\nwas both the activating factor of the seven feelings and four\nbeginnings, and in this sense was less idealistic in relation to\nPrinciple. He argued that Principle needed somewhere\nto settle before it could guide or affect things, and that was\nki, the material force. How can we relate this to daily life\nin some way? The man and woman needed to exist and to mate before the\n\u201cprinciple\u201d for fertilisation could take place, which is\nperhaps a more practical way of looking at things. This then had\nimplications for more important moral matters. Yulgok concluded that\nwhile the seven feelings included the four beginnings, the four\nbeginnings did not contain the seven feelings\u2014in order to\nmaintain human nature \u201cinnately\u201d good and intact. Bongrae\nSeok (2019: 24) clarifies that Yulgok (and Kobong, for that matter)\ndid not believe that\n\n\nthe goodness of the Four is a distinct moral property explained\nexclusively by [i] but a common property shared by the Seven\nexplained by both [i] and qi [ki],\n\n\nhence, in a sense \u201csmoothening the sharp distinction between the\nFour and the Seven\u201d as argued by T\u2019oegye and rearticulated\nby Ugye. Seok (2019: 19) also notes how Ugye interpreted the four\nbeginnings and the seven feelings as separate sets of emotions, with\nthe \u201cseven\u201d having the potential for evil, drawing on\nT\u2019oegye who clearly viewed Principle as the essence of\nthe mind and ki as the function (on which Principle\nmounts), again using the interrelationship between essence-function,\nor che-yong, discussed above in relation to Chinul. For the\nKorean Neo-Confucians, this only reinforced the need for proper moral\neducation and the incessant need for self-cultivations to guide one\nfrom falling prey of the shortcomings of one\u2019s physical,\nmaterial and environmental existence as it related to the mind and\none\u2019s human nature (see E. Chung 1995; Ro 1989; Cawley 2019:\n84\u201389). Though Yulgok was interested in the metaphysical aspects\nof Neo-Confucianism, Ro Young-Chan (2017: 74) underscores his interest\nin the practical side of \u201csagely learning\u201d.\n\nBoth T\u2019oegye\u2019s Diagrams and Yulgok\u2019s\nEssentials advocate pathways towards sagehood and promote the\nconcept of self-cultivation. Both scholars also emphasised the special\nrole of the king who was expected to be a paragon of Confucian\nmorality and humanity (ren), the living embodiment of the\nideals of \u201csagehood\u201d. T\u2019oegye and Yulgok elucidate\nour place in a morally directed universe, where one is expected to act\nresponsibly towards other members of the family and the larger\nsociety, or rather \u201cpractice\u201d a social vision of morality\nin our daily lives. For both scholars, sagehood represented a noble\nsavoir vivre, the goal of which was to benefit others, and\nthis in itself was the key to becoming a sage. T\u2019oegye\nand Yulgok provide us with archetypes of a sort of East Asian\nNeo-Confucian \u201cSocial Contract\u201d, to draw on Jean Jacques\nRousseau\u2019s (1712\u20131778) major work published in 1762. Both\nKorean scholars stress the moral and social responsibility of those in\npower, but also the moral responsibility of individuals to each other\nas members of an interconnected society\u2014and this is something\nthe world can appreciate now more than ever, as we face a global\npandemic in 2020/21, where through socially responsible distancing, we\nboth respect and protect others.\n5. The Horak Debate\n\nThe \u201cHo-rak\u201d debate, literally refers to the general\n\u201cProvincial-Capital\u201d divide among the different\nsub-factions of the \u201cNoron\u201d (Old Doctrine) Faction, which\nhad been initiated by scholars who had followed the metaphysical\nstance of Yulgok for the most part. As Kang (2003 [2006: 300]) points\nout,\n\n\nThe problem was that differences in academic opinions were associated\nwith antagonism between factions or regions.\n\n\nTherefore, scholars aligned themselves with either T\u2019oegye or\nYulgok\u2019s interpretations depending on their factional\naffiliation, and if one disagreed with the faction in power it could\nhave serious consequences (think Republicans/Democrats in the U.S.).\nIn this instance, like the Four-Seven Debate, it relates to a series\nof arguments raised in correspondence between two primary scholars of\nthis time, who were tightly aligned with different factions: Han\nW\u014fn-jin (1682\u20131751) from Ch\u2019ungch\u2019\u014fng\nprovince and Yi Kan (1677\u20131727) from Ky\u014fnggi province where\nSeoul is located. Seoh (1977:47) notes that both scholars are\n\n\nparticularly important because it was their debate over the definition\nof nature that precipitated a resurgence of the ki\nschool.\n\n\nThough Yi Kan underscored the central role of Principle, Han\nposited the operation of the human mind as dependent on\nki\u2014both original ki, and corrupted\nki. These ideas were related, not only to the emotions and\nhow they affect the actualised mind (thoughts/actions), but led to\nother speculative questions:\n\nHow should one describe the unaroused mind (mibal), in\nterms of ki or Principle, or a mixture?\nWhether sages and ordinary people have the same nature?, and\nIs the nature of human beings and nonhuman animals identical?\n(Richard Kim 2017: 90; Choi Y. 2011)\n\n\nRichard Kim (2017: 90) notes that such questions became the\ndebates\u2019 \u201cfoundational issue\u201d, thought it also\nbrought up some of issues related to the previous debate, in regard to\nthe effects of the emotions on the mind, and whether minds of sages\nand normal people were originally the same.\n\nThe notion of the unaroused mind appears in the Doctrine of the\nMean, one of the Four Books:\n\n\nBefore the feelings of pleasure, anger, sorrow and joy are aroused it\nis called equilibrium (chung [\u4e2d], centrality, mean).\nWhen these feelings are aroused and each and all attain due measure\nand degree, it is called harmony. (SB-Chan: 98)\n\n\nChoi Young-jin (2011: 9) describes this as \u201ca state of\nmoderation [\u2026] bent neither one way or another [\u2026] the\nstate of balance\u201d. This actual state of mind had never been\nanalysed in such minute detail before, nor had it been considered in\nsuch detail in relation to the sage, normal humans, and other animals:\nwere they the same, or not, at the microcosmic level of their mind in\nterms of ki or Principle? Han W\u014fn-jin\u2019s\nessay on the \u201cExplanation of the Original Nature and the\nPsycho-Physical Nature\u201d, sowed the seeds of the debate. In this\nessay he suggested that the original nature, even before being aroused\nin the mind (mibal, as argued by T\u2019oegye), was already\ninteracting with ki, in other words, energised by material\nforce, or as Richard Kim (2017: 92) puts it, Han viewed\n\u201cgi [ki] as constitutive of the inactivated\nmind\u201d. For Han, Principle required ki, so\nki already had to exist in the mind and this ki had\nto be originally good or in equilibrium, balanced and unmotivated by\ndesires. Clearly Han was \u201cadhering more strictly to the\nmaterialist core of the ki school\u201d, while claiming that\n\u201cnature is not an abstract [undifferentiated] entity\u201d, and\nthat Principle \u201cis nothing but a law of the dynamics of\nki,\u201d in other words, Principle had no concrete\nexistence of any sort (Seoh 1977: 48). He ultimately saw the nature of\na human and other animals as different even in their unaroused or\nmibal state where ki was inactive, and used their\ndifferent psycho-physical make-up (due to the variant manifestations\nof material force when activated) as the basis for his thesis. Han\nultimately considered the sage to possess a pure form of ki,\nalready balanced and pure even in an unaroused state, unlike other\nbeings (which for him also included women and children) and in this\nsense he is more hierarchically inclined in his approach, with a more\nidealistic vision of the sage\u2014something usually linked with\nproponents of Principle.\n\nYi Kan advocated the primacy of Principle in all living\nthings, and therefore the immanence of goodness embedded within the\nConfucian virtues. The idea of the immanence of Principle in\nall things is also addressed in a more macrocosmic sense in Zhang\nZai\u2019s Diagram of the Western Inscription, which appears\nin T\u2019oegye\u2019s Diagrams, though here again, in the Korean\ncontext these ideas are analysed in a more microcosmic manner. Yi\nasserted that human and nonhuman animals had the potential to manifest\nthe universal \u201coriginal mind\u201d (\u672c\u5fc3, K.\nbonsim). This, according to Yi, was not always manifest by\nhumans because their \u201cphysical nature\u201d and, thereby, their\npsycho-physical preponderances varied: some humans were good, but some\nacted badly, just as was the case for nonhuman animals. He rather\nsuggested that the apparent differences, were actually nothing other\nthan differences in temperaments due to the turbidity of ki\nafter feelings were aroused, but that the underlying\nPrinciple meant that they were morally unified in an\nunaroused state (R. Kim 2017). This also meant that theoretically,\nwomen too, even children, could aspire to be sages because their\n\u201coriginal mind\u201d, which was \u201cthe foundation of for\nhuman morality\u201d was no different from that of a sage, what\nmattered was that one controlled one\u2019s desires because\n\u201csages are those who maintain their moral self\u201d: those who\ndevelop themselves to the optimum level of humanity (Lee\n2011: 108). As Lee (2011: 111) asserts, Yi\n\n\nwent so far as to say that the original mind-heart [sim] is\nclearly present in anyone at any time, and the mind-hearts of sages\nand commoners are alike when aroused.\n\n\nFor Yi, what made one a sage was the fact that they\n\u201cacted\u201d morally\u2014being aware of what is good but not\nacting on it at all times was what made one a \u201ccommon\u201d\nperson.\n\nSeoh (1977: 43) summarises the debate as follows:\n\n\nYi Kan equated the nature of man with other creatures and stressed its\nuniversality, while Han maintained the uniqueness of the nature of man\nin contrast with other creatures.\n\n\nOne interesting contribution in regard to this debate, came from one\nof the few women of the Chos\u014fn period to write on\nNeo-Confucianism (hence trained in Classical Chinese), Im Yunjidang\n(1721\u20131793). She disagreed with Yulgok\u2019s interpretation of\nki, whom her own brothers had agreed with, and instead\nclaimed \u201cthat each thing [or species] in the universe possesses\na particularised and embodied nature\u201d, while ultimately\nconvinced of the role of \u201cHeaven endowed\u201d\nPrinciple (Kim Sungmoon 2017: 190\u2013191). Im also wrote\nabout the moral equality of both sexes, something highlighted by the\nearly Catholics in Korea. Kang Ch\u014fngiltang (1772\u20131832),\nanother female Confucian scholar from this period, emphasised that\nhuman nature is good, as well as the importance of putting Confucian\nideals into practice. Her short poem on \u201cConcentrating on\nMindfulness\u201d [or reverence] manages to capture with exquisite\nconciseness the main themes and the ultimate goal of Neo-Confucian\nlearning in Chos\u014fn, namely, sagehood (Kim Youngmin 2007: 226,\nslightly altered translation):\n\n\nMyriad Patterns [principles] originate from Heaven-and-Earth.\n\nOne mind unites nature and emotions.\n\nWithout concentrating on mindfulness,\n\nHow can you manage the long trip to sagehood?\n\n\nInterestingly, by this stage it is important to note that Catholicism,\nconsidered as part of \u201cWestern Learning\u201d\n(\u897f\u5b78, K. S\u014fhak), had already attracted the\ninterest of some Neo-Confucian scholars, directing them away from an\nunemotional Principle, towards a belief in an anthropomorphic\ncaring deity.\n6. Confucian Reactions to Early Catholicism\n6.1 Matteo Ricci and Reactions to Western Theology\n\nThe time frame of the Horak debate also coincided with Catholic texts\nbeing read by Korean Neo-Confucian philosophers. The most important\ntext from this period was Tianzhu shiyi\n(\u5929\u4e3b\u5be6\u7fa9; K. Ch\u014fnju sir\u016di)\n[The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven], which had a great impact in\nKorea after being read by scholars there (see Ricci 1985). It was\nactually written by Matteo Ricci (1552\u20131610), an Italian Jesuit\nmissionary who had lived for many years (and died) in China. Ricci\nweaved in the mediaeval Scholastic philosophy of his European\ntradition into a newly enlarged tapestry including his newly\ndiscovered Confucian ideas. He retraced the trajectory of\nNeo-Confucianism, revealing its Buddhist and Daoist legacy that has\nbeen carefully coloured over by Zhu Xi, whose ideas also dictated how\nKoreans received the Confucian canon, something that clearly irked the\nKorean scholars. These ideas and messages had serious repercussions in\nKorea, where, as Seoh Munsang (1977: 46\u201347) points out, the\nintellectual milieu had retained Zhu Xi\u2019s orthodoxy where\nmetaphysical speculation was \u201cstill a vital force polarising the\ni and ki schools\u201d.\n\nYi Sugwang (1563\u20131628) provides a short analysis of\nRicci\u2019s text, which is of value as it is the earliest commentary\non the text in Korea. He remarked that Ricci\u2019s God,\nTianzhu (pronounced Ch\u2019\u014fnju in Korean),\nhad created the world, hence was worshiped and praised, something he\ncriticised as he clearly understood Principle to be behind\nall things. He incorrectly indicates that Ricci, like Confucians,\nasserts that human nature is originally good: Ricci had actually\nsuggested that the Confucians had no unanimity of position in this\nregard, as Mencius had said it was good, but Xunzi regarded it as\nevil\u2014a point clearly avoided by Korean Neo-Confucian scholars\nalmost entirely (Yi 2000: 61). Yi Ik (1681\u20131763), who headed one\nof Chos\u014fn\u2019s many scholarly factions, the Namin\n(Southern) faction, in more recent times described as a proponent of\nSirhak \u201cpractical\u201d thought, also compiled a wide\nrange of encyclopedic texts and wrote commentaries on the Confucian\ncanon too. He engaged more intellectually with Ricci\u2019s ideas in\nhis critique entitled Ch\u2019\u014fnju sir\u016di-bal\n(\u5929\u4e3b\u5be6\u7fa9\u8dcb) [Reactions Against\nTianzhu zhiyi] (Kim Shin-ja [ed.] 1987: 22\u201323). Yi Ik,\nwho was also a follower of T\u2019oegye\u2019s metaphysics and wrote\ntreatises on the Four-Seven debate such as Sach\u2019il\nsinp\u2019y\u014f, (\u56db\u4e03\u65b0\u7de8) [New\nTreaty on the Four-Seven Debate], did not accept that\n\u201cGod\u201d had created the world, and outright rejects the idea\nthat this God had incarnated himself as a man. He also examined the\nmoral teachings of another Jesuit, Diego de Pantoja (1571\u20131618),\nand in his commentary on Pantoja\u2019s Qike\n(\u4e03\u514b) [Seven Victories], which described how to overcome\nthe seven deadly sins, he argued that if one removed what was written\nabout God and the devil, the morals could almost be considered\nConfucian. This reflects the non-theistic orientation of\nNeo-Confucianism in Korea, but also highlights how Yi was not about to\noverturn his onto-cosmological inheritance from T\u2019oegye (Yi Ik\nS\u014fngho sas\u014fl: 343).\n\nSome of Yi\u2019s associate Namin scholars were much more\ncritical of Western ideas in general, especially Sin Hudam\n(1702\u20131761) and An Ch\u014fngbok (1712\u20131783). Sin Hudam\nwas particularly scathing of Catholic teachings in his critique\nentitled S\u014fhak py\u014fn (\u897f\u5b78\u8fa8)\n[Critique of Western Learning]. There is a sub-stratum of thought at\nplay in Sin\u2019s text, which hopes to dissuade others from\nbelieving in Jesus as God, or God in the form of a man who spreads\nteachings to the poor. This idea would disengage God from the realm of\ninsensitive Neo-Confucian metaphysics and could potentially wreak\nhavoc for the king and society at large if the social hierarchy\ninscribed universally through Principle were to be\nrejected.\n\nThis foreboding is much more urgent in the writings of a fellow\nNamin scholar An Ch\u014fngbok, as his own son-in-law\nKw\u014fn Ilsin (1736\u20131791) was among the earliest Confucian\nconverts to Catholicism. These were the incentives behind his two\ncritiques of Catholicism: Ch\u2019\u014fnhakko\n(\u5929\u5b78\u8003) [Thoughts on Heavenly Learning], and\nCh\u2019\u014fnhak mundap (\u5929\u5b78\u554f\u7b54)\n[Questions and Answers on Heavenly Learning]. An Ch\u014fngbok draws\nour attention to the importance of the figure of Jesus and his message\nas the focal point of these young Korean Neo-Confucian scholars who\nhad overturned the onto-cosmology of Principle and\nki, which then also had no bearing on one\u2019s human\nnature and mind. In Ch\u2019\u014fnhak mundap, An upholds\nhis traditional Neo-Confucian horizon and suggests that Catholics\nmisused Confucian vocabulary when they discussed sagehood (in relation\nto Jesus), emphasising that Confucius did not discuss the supernatural\nand was concerned with this life (Kim Shin-ja [ed.] 1987:\n28\u201329).\n\nThese Confucians were all toeing the line of orthodox Confucian\nmorality, which was practical (not mystical), and where the onus for\nmorality was on oneself, inscribed into one\u2019s mind and human\nnature. For them, humans decided their own moral fate by mastering\none\u2019s desires, and neither the devil nor God had any part in\nthis. The \u201cthis-worldliness\u201d of the Confucian discourse\nwas something they championed, advocating its benefits for human\naffairs governed by \u201cmindfulness\u201d, and not by any sort of\ninterference from the spirit world. In this sense they were upholding\nthe agnostic stance of Confucius himself in the Analects:\n\n\nIf we are not yet able to serve man, how can we serve spiritual\nbeings? [\u2026] If we do not yet know about life, how can we know\nabout death? (SB-Chan: 36)\n\n6.2 Confucian-Catholics, Tasan and Moral Priorities\n\nThe earliest converts to Catholicism were all Confucian-trained\nscholars from aristocratic (yangban) families. Yi Py\u014fk\n(1754\u20131786), as well as Yi S\u016dnghun (1756\u20131801), were\nthe leaders of this group who were soon joined by other yangban\nscholars, such as the two Kw\u014fn brothers (including the son-in-law\nof An Ch\u014fngbok), and the three Ch\u014fng brothers. The youngest\nof the Ch\u014fng brothers, Yagyong (1762\u20131836), more generally\nknown by his penname Tasan (often written as Dasan), is one of the\nmost widely acclaimed philosophers in Korea\u2019s intellectual\nhistory, discussed below. His early Confucian mentor, Yi Py\u014fk,\nwrote the first lengthy outline of Christian doctrine in Korea,\nS\u014fnggyo yoji (\u8056\u654e\u8981\u65e8) [The\nEssence of the Divine Doctrine] in Classical Chinese for his\n\u201cConfucian\u201d entourage. However, his hymn,\nCh\u2019\u014fnju konggy\u014fng-ga\n(\ucc9c\uc8fc\uacf5\uacbd\uac00) [Hymn in Adoration of God],\nis considered one of the first hymns written in Han\u2019g\u016dl,\nthe vernacular script, which was first promulgated in the fifteenth\ncentury, though generally associated with women and men from the\npoorer classes. In fact, so poorly was this simplified script esteemed\nin elite circles that it was referred to as \u014enmun\n(\u8afa\u6587), meaning the vulgar script. But Yi\u2019s hymn was\nalso deeply Confucian, advocating loyalty to the king, emphasising\nfilial piety, and even encouraging adherence to the \u201cFive\nRelationships\u201d. This Confucian aspect of early Catholicism\nreflects an interesting transcultural interaction between both\ntraditions, highlighting their moral priorities. Ch\u014fng\nYakch\u014fn (1758\u20131816) and Ch\u014fng Yakchong\n(1760\u20131801), also wrote Catholic texts in Han\u2019g\u016dl,\nwhich also exhort Confucian morality: loyalty to the king, as well as\nfilial piety, tropes already found in Yi\u2019s hymn. In fact, in\nCh\u014fng Yakch\u014fn\u2019s Sipkyemy\u014fng-ga\n(\uc2ed\uacc4\uba85\uac00) [Hymn in Praise of the Ten\nCommandments], he writes that \u201cAmong all the things in the\nworld, filial piety is the most important\u201d, which also clarifies\nthe singular importance of filial piety in Korean Confucianism (Ha\n(ed.) 2000: 334). Ch\u014fng Yakchong wrote a much longer treatise on\nCatholicism in Han\u2019g\u016dl, called Chugyo\nyoji (\uc8fc\uad50\uc694\uc9c0) [The Essence of The\nLord\u2019s Teachings], obviously directed at a growing audience who\nwere not yangban scholars. In fact, many were women and members of the\nlower classes, overturning and destabilising entrenched hierarchical\nConfucian social norms, while at the same time advocating Confucian\nmorality, but supplemented with egalitarian Christian ideas (Cawley\n2015).\n\nTasan, like many others, renounced the religion after witnessing close\nrelations and friends brutally executed, and as a result his authorial\ncontrol had been clearly compromised through the fear of his own\nexecution, as well as the fact that his wife and children could have\nbeen sold as slaves (Cawley 2014b). Some scholars, such as Kim Shin-ja\n(2006 [2010: 92\u2013102]), comment on the philosophical inclinations\nin Tasan\u2019s writings, and consider him as having returned to the\n\u201coriginal theory of Confucius\u201d, known as Susahak\n(\u6d19\u6cd7\u5b78). However, Tasan\u2019s commentaries are\nfull of references to \u201cThe Sovereign on High\u201d,\nSangje (which is the Korean pronunciation of\nShangdi), despite the fact that the Analects never\nmention this term, not even a single time. It appears only five times\nin the entire Four Books! This term was used in the Five\nClassics, as highlighted by Matteo Ricci, and was of great\nimportance to the early Catholics in Korea, who, having read\nRicci\u2019s text, considered Sangje to be God. Why might\nthis be important? Seen in this light, Tasan\u2019s interest in\n\u201coriginal\u201d Confucianism (Susahak), may have been\nmerely a ploy to detract from his religious affiliation with\nCatholicism. The Sangje one encounters in Tasan\u2019s\nwritings is a personal, monotheistic, creator deity, and not\nan impersonal Principle. Indeed, Tasan\u2019s\n\u201cdis-assembling\u201d of Neo-Confucianism, extracting the\nZhu-Cheng influenced metaphysical discourse, and reorienting it\ntowards Sangje, resembles the strategy of Matteo Ricci,\nthough supplemented with a sense of active social morality (see Cawley\n2014a). Keum (1980 [2000: 189]) insists that\n\n\nCatholic Doctrine not only provided a bridge to a new understanding of\nthe universe, it also became a spring-board for the development of his\n[Tasan\u2019s] Neo-Confucianism,\n\n\nleading to a creative synthesis, which can also be described as\n\u201cPost-Confucian\u201d as it moves beyond the metaphysical\nparameters of Ihak (School of Principle) or\nS\u014fngnihak (School of Nature and Principle). It\nmight even be described as a sort of cryptic\n\u201cChristo-Confucianology\u201d, whereby Christian motifs inform\nhis discourse on morality, which is guided by an anthropomorphic\nSangje (discussed in detail in Cawley 2014b).\n\nIn Chungyong kang\u016dibo\n(\u4e2d\u5eb8\u8b1b\u7fa9\u88dc) [Supplement to Lectures on\nthe Doctrine of the Mean], Tasan (Kugy\u014fk\ny\u014fyudang ch\u014fns\u014f: vol. 1: 390) queries the link\nbetween the \u201cDiagram of the Supreme Ultimate\u201d (which had\nprovided the foundation for T\u2019oegye\u2019s onto-cosmology) and\noriginal Confucian ideas, noting that, \u201cit was written over a\nthousand years after Confucius\u201d, hence not found in\n\u201coriginal\u201d Confucianism at all. In another text,\nMaengja yo\u016di (\u5b5f\u5b50\u8981\u7fa9) [The\nEssentials of The Mencius] Tasan notes that\n\n\nthe circle in this diagram which represents the Supreme Ultimate does\nnot appear anywhere in the [Five] Classics. (Maengja\nyo\u016di: 383)\n\n\nTasan, similar to Matteo Ricci, reorients his ideas away from these\nwidely accepted Neo-Confucian metaphysical norms towards an all-seeing\nSangje to provide an alternative foundation for his moral\nframework. It is Sangje who re-stabilises Tasan\u2019s\nre-conceptualised ontotheological-cosmology, disentangling it from\nPrinciple, the Supreme Ultimate, yin and yang, as well as the\nfive elements. It is Sangje who makes Tasan\u2019s\nphilosophy theistic-oriented. In Ch\u2019unch\u2019u kojing\n(\u6625\u79cb\u8003\u5fb5) [Evidential Analysis of the\nSpring and Summer Annals] written circa 1812, he asks,\n\u201cWho is Sangje?\u201d, answering that\n\n\nSangje is a being that creates, governs and\nmaintains heaven, earth, spirits, humans and all things, but also\ntranscends them. (Ch\u2019unch\u2019u kojing,\na283_363a)\n\n\nFurthermore, this quote echoes the full title of Ricci\u2019s first\nchapter in the True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven:\n\n\nA Discussion on the creation of Heaven, Earth, and all things by the\nLord of Heaven and on the way he governs and sustains them. (Ricci\n1985:65)\n\n\nEarlier scholars such as Yun Hyu (1617\u20131680) and Pak Sedang\n(1629\u20131703) had dared to be critical of Zhu Xi\u2019s\ninterpretations of texts and rituals, but Mark Setton (1997:\n102\u2013103) notes how Tasan took this to another level, arguing\nthat even his conception of Confucian virtue was \u201cdiametrically\nopposed\u201d to Zhu Xi\u2019s. Setton also notes how Tasan even\nrejected the introspective aspects of self-cultivation, advocating an\noutward ethical practice based on our moral priorities. This then is\ncontingent upon free will, a radical idea in Tasan\u2019s work, where\ngood and evil are not aspects of one\u2019s material force, but\nrather, related to the psychological level, and only exist \u201cin\nthe context of concrete human relations\u201d (Setton 1989: 380).\nFree will is then the defining feature of the human being because\n\n\nThis ability to make moral choices, and consequently to shape his own\nmoral destiny, places man in an entirely different category from the\nanimals. (1989: 380)\n\n\nThis also shapes Tasan\u2019s other writings that highlight his\nprofound interest in reforming his society: Ky\u014fngse\nyup\u2019yo (\u7d93\u4e16\u907a\u8868) [Design for Good\nGovernment], Mongmin sims\u01d2\n(\u7267\u6c11\u5fc3\u66f8) [Admonitions on Governing the\nPeople], and H\u016dmh\u016dm sins\u01d2\n(\u6b3d\u6b3d\u65b0\u66f8) [Toward a New Jurisprudence]. These\nthree texts are generally considered to embody Tasan\u2019s practical\nSirhak ideology, though they too draw on commentaries and\nexamples from Confucian literature. However, Tasan\u2019s writings do\nnot necessarily eulogise Confucianism and its laws, rather, we often\nfind a harsh critique of it, which moves away from metaphysical\ndebates to deal with the actual matters at hand\u2014a society in\ndecay, and poor people suffering from harsh punishments and taxes (see\nB. Choi (trans.) 2010 [Mongmin sims\u01d2]). Justice, in\nTasan\u2019s writings, becomes a call for moral responsibility, a\ngesture of \u201cHumane\u201d government actively involved in\nloving the people, where we can again possibly find Christian\nundertones.\n7. Emergence of Modernisation and Confucian Challenges\n\nThe nineteenth century was a time of transformation in East Asia,\nparticularly in Korea, and Confucian scholars were still eager to\nvalidate their discourse, even if it meant persecuting rivals: between\n1866 and 1871, between 8,000 and 10,000 Catholics, men, women and\nchildren were tortured and executed by Confucian authorities. Choi\nMin-Hong (1980:191\u2013217) notes the re-emergence of philosophers\ninterested in Principle in the nineteenth century, many who\nhad been linked with the Namin faction, hence, proponents of\nthe T\u2019oegye\u2019s metaphysical ideas. This included Ki\nCh\u014fngjin (1798\u20131876) and Yi Hangno (1792\u20131868), the\nlatter who considered Principle to be the basic substance of\nthe universe, and \u201csomething spiritual\u201d (1980: 194). Ki\nCh\u014fngjin, who again returned to study the writings of Zhu Xi,\nalso re-engaged with studying sage learning and \u201cresearching the\nClassics\u201d. He regarded Principle as a sort of spiritual\nSupreme Ultimate, which then produced yin and yang (and the material\nforce)\u2014in other words, Principle preceded ki,\nand this Principle was reflected differently in men and\nanimals (Choi M.-H. 1980: 196\u2013198). Yi Chin-sang\n(1818\u20131885) also considered Principle as preceding\nki, but also as that which generated it, therefore,\nself-cultivation lay in the study of the mind and not in knowing\nexternal things due to man\u2019s \u201cHeaven-bestowed cognitive\npowers\u201d which depended on \u201ctranscendental Li\n[Principle]\u201d. Such idealistic ideas were hardly needed\nat a time when society was in such a state of disarray, already\nforeboded in the writings of Tasan.\n\nAt the same time, another branch emerged championing ki, such\nas Ch\u2019oe Han-ki (1803\u20131879), who was weary of being\ngoverned by prejudices. Ch\u2019oe\u2019s work has been re-evaluated\nin more recent times. Scholars underscore his empiricist philosophy\nthat investigated the role of experience in a methodologically\nsophisticated manner, reminiscent of John Locke (1632\u20131704), but\nused in Ch\u2019oe\u2019s work to undermine the idea of a naturally\ngood mind before learning from accumulated experiences (Park 2004). He\nwas very well acquainted with European science and observes a more\npractical interest in the material force. One can notice his ontology\nbased on a \u201cOne-Dimensional ki theory\u201d, which, in\nhis opinion, was what shaped all things, even preceding all forms,\nwhile at the same time \u201cdenying the [Zhu Xi\u2019s\nschool\u2019s] world of innate reasoning power\u201d (Choi M.-H.\n1980: 205). He was also influenced by the changing times, critical of\nthe class system and the inhumane treatment of the population, issues\nraised by Tasan earlier in the century.\n\nPark Chong-hong (2004: 396) critiques the trend of the (later-called)\nSirhak [Practical] scholars, who \u201cmade the mistake of\narranging encyclopedic knowledge\u201d and other \u201ctrivial\nmatters\u201d, clearly unable to fathom what was coming, and unable\nto provide Chos\u014fn with the tools it needed to survive the\n\u201cmodernisation\u201d that would soon be thrust upon the\npeninsula, leading to Japan\u2019s eventual colonial rule over the\npeninsula (1910\u20131945). As the situation on the peninsula\ndisintegrated, Koreans sought alternatives to Confucianism to deal\nwith social issues and inequality. The first of these New Religious\nMovements (NRMs) was known as Tonghak (\u6771\u5b78), or\nEastern Learning, to contrast directly with the foreign \u201cWestern\nLearning\u201d, and it attempted to help hopeless poor peasants whose\nlives were getting progressively worse, especially in the southern\nregions far from the capital. Tonghak was founded by Ch\u2019oe Che-u\n(1824\u20131864), known by his followers as Su-un, and while\nproviding an alternative to Confucianism, it used the name of the\n\u201cSovereign on High\u201d (Sangje) from the Confucian\nClassics to refer to its deity, while also using the Catholic term\n\u201cLord of Heaven\u201d (Ch\u2019\u014fnju) as well.\nThere were splinter groups formed out of this NRM such as\nCh\u016dngsando (more commonly written Jeungsando), and Daesoon\nJinrihoe, both worshipping different iterations of\nSangje\u2014a monotheistic Korean deity with Confucian\norigins (see Cawley 2019: ch. 5).\n\nAs the end of the Chos\u014fn dynasty drew nearer, and Korea opened up\nto Western countries, many Protestant missionaries would enter Korea\nby the late 1880s to make their mark on its religious culture. This\nmotivated some Confucian scholars to attempt to revitalise\nConfucianism, emphasising its religious aspects, while others sought\nto reform Confucianism to counter the attempts by the Japanese\ngovernment to \u201cJapanize\u201d the peninsula. Interestingly,\nKeum (1980 [2000: 219]) comments that \u201cIt goes without saying\nthat the idea of Confucian Religion was prompted by the Christian\nconcept of a transcendent God\u201d, as well as the idea of\n\u201cthe organisation of a religious community [and] their own\nreligious institutions\u201d. However, this did not really take off,\nlikely due to the elitism associated with Confucianism, and the way it\nhad been responsible for the unfair treatment of people from different\nclasses, and in particular, women, who were increasingly embracing\nProtestantism, which had facilitated their education in\n\u201cmodern\u201d schools.\n\nHan Hyong-jo (2016) articulates that more recent understandings of\nKorean Confucianism \u201chas mirrored its chief nemesis,\nmodernity\u201d and outlines three stages:\n\nDenial (1890s\u20131930s), where Confucianism was blamed for the\nloss of Korea\u2019s sovereignty;\nExcuse (1930s\u20131980s): Sirhak, whereby\n\u201cpractical\u201d ideas were \u201cfished\u201d out of the\ntradition as a sort of retrospective consolation had things gone\ndifferently;\nRehabilitation (1980s\u20131997): suggesting that Confucianism is\nbehind of the economic rise of Korea and linked to the emergence of\nits democracy, despite the fact that Confucians were against industry\nand labour, and they supported unelected rulers from a royal\nclan.\n\n\nIndeed, rulers\u2019 challengers were easily disposed of\u2014even\nif they should be senior members of their own\nfamily\u2014contravening teachings on filial piety. Confucianism has\nalso been linked with a resurgence of \u201cAsian\u201d values, or\nrecalibrated (yet again) to permit a feminist turn, and possibly even\nfound in some of the Juche ideas of North Korea\u2019s state\nideology, which commands undisputed loyalty (chung) to its\nDear Leader.\n\nConfucianism is currently at a crossroads as it interacts with other\ntraditions in the twenty-first century, nestling between them and\ninsinuating itself throughout them (Min 2016). In a sense, one might\nlook to recovering what Han Hyoung-jo (2016) describes as a lost art\nof Confucian ihak, a form of cultivation of the mind, whereby\nreengaging with it might just draw us closer to how it was understood\nfor centuries, and bring us closer to its goal, which is not\ndemocracy, but something more noble, sagehood. Han (2016) suggests\nthat this has the potential to cure us from \u201cself-oblivion and\nself-centredness\u201d, the deficiencies and flaws of our culture\ntoday, by helping us to rediscover our innate potential for humane\nco-existence, irrespective of our political or religious views. Korean\nConfucianism and its emphasis on sage learning, rather than being\noutmoded, may be the agnostic moral approach that has the potential to\nreconnect us to ourselves and each other, at a time when psychological\ndistress is on the rise in all modern \u201cdeveloped\u201d\ndemocracies.\n",
