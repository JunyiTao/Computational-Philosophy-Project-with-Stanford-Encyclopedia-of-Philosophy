    "main_text": "Pure Consciousness Events || Defenders of Pure Consciousness Events\n4.1 Defenders of Pure Consciousness Events\n\nDefenders of PCEs depend on alleged references to pure consciousness\nin the mystical literature. One example is the Buddhist\nphilosopher Paramaartha (499\u2013569) who stated\nexplicitly that all of our cognitions were \u201cconditioned\u201d\nby our concepts save for the\n\u201cunconditioned\u201d experience of the emptiness of\nphenomena (Forman 1989). Another example is Meister Eckhart\nwho described a \u201cforgetting\u201d that abandons concepts and\nsense-experience to sink into a mystical\n\u201coblivion\u201d (Forman 1990, 121\u2013159). In addition, Robert\nForman has testified to a PCE he himself underwent (Forman 1990,\nIntroduction).\n",
