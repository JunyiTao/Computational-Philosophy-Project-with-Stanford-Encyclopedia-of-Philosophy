    "main_text": "Significant Interactions Between Modalities || Dynamics of Intentions\n4.6 Dynamics of Intentions\n\nThe notion of\n intention\n is crucial in BDI systems, as it in some sense defines the\nchoices the agent will make, thus affecting her behavior. Thus, the\ndynamics of intention is also a crucial subject, as it\ndescribes the way intentions are generated, preserved, modified or\ndiscarded.\n\nFor an initial point, how do intentions change after the agent learns\na new piece of information? According to Roy (2008: Chapter 5), if the\noriginal intentions are compatible with the new information, then they\nare \u2018reshaped\u2019; otherwise, the agent discards them without\ncreating any new intention (or, analogously, generating an intention\nfor something that has been already achieved). Thus, after an\nannouncement of \\(\\chi\\) the agent intends to do \\(\\varphi\\) if and\nonly if \\(\\chi\\) is compatible with her intentions and \\(\\varphi\\) is\na restricted consequence of the agent\u2019s initial intentions, or\nelse \\(\\varphi\\) is a \u2018known\u2019 consequence of\n\\(\\chi\\)\u2019s announcement. In a formula, \n\\[\n[\\chi{!}]I\\varphi \\leftrightarrow \\left( \\left(\\hI\\chi \\land I\\left(\\chi \\rightarrow [\\chi{!}]\\varphi\\right)\\right) \\lor \\left(\\lnot \\hI\\chi \\land [\\chi{!}]A\\varphi\\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\n\nThere are other proposals. In van der Hoek, Jamroga, and Wooldridge\n(2007), intentions are defined, roughly speaking, as plans the agent\nbelieves have not yet been fulfilled. As a consequence of this,\nchanges in the agent\u2019s beliefs lead to changes on her\nintentions. For example, after any observation, the agent will drop\nintentions that she believes have been accomplished: \n\\[\n[\\chi{!}]B\\varphi \\rightarrow [\\chi{!}]\\lnot I\\varphi\n\\]\n\n\nMoreover, she will drop any intention she believes it is impossible to\nachieve: \n\\[\n[\\chi{!}]B\\lnot\\varphi \\rightarrow [\\chi{!}]\\lnot I\\varphi\n\\]\n\n\nBut, just as changes in the agent\u2019s information (knowledge,\nbeliefs) should trigger changes in her intentions, changes in her\nintentions may also trigger changes in (some of) her beliefs.\nIntuitively, having the intention to achieve a given \\(\\varphi\\)\nreduces the actions that the agent \u2018can\u2019 perform, from the\nones she can actually carry on, to those that will still allow (and\nmaybe assure) that \\(\\varphi\\) will be achieved. In other words, a\nchange in the agent\u2019s intentions triggers also a change in her\nbeliefs about the (sequence of) actions that will be available in the\nfuture. This is the idea followed in Icard, Pacuit, and Shoham (2010),\nwhich studies the interaction between intention revision and belief\nrevision by introducing postulates for both actions, with these\npostulates describing the two processes\u2019 interplay. In the\ninteresting case of intention revision, the postulates state that (i)\na new intention will take precedence over previous ones (and thus old\nones should be eliminated when in conflict), (ii) modulo coherence, no\nfurther change should be made on the agent\u2019s intentions (in\nparticular, no extraneous intentions should be added), and (iii)\nnon-contingent beliefs do not change with intention\n revision.[16]\n",
