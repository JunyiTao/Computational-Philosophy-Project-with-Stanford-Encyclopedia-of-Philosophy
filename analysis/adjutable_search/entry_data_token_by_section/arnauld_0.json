    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nAntoine Arnauld was born in Paris on February 6, 1612, the twentieth\nand last child of an important French family. He is often referred to\nin the French literature as Le Grand Arnauld. Another famous\nmember of the family was his sister, M\u00e8re Ang\u00e9lique\nArnauld. Installed by her wealthy and powerful father as abbess of the\nconvent of Port-Royal in 1602 at the age of eleven, she later reformed\nthe convent and it became a center of intense religious life. Several\nof Arnauld\u2019s sisters were nuns at Port-Royal, where his mother\njoined them after the death of his father in 1621.\n\nThe young Antoine attended the Coll\u00e8ge de\nCalvi-Sorbonne, where one of his fellow students was his nephew,\nIsaac Lema\u00eetre de Sacy. Arnauld went on to study philosophy at\nthe Coll\u00e8ge de Lisieux, and then decided to follow in\nhis father\u2019s steps as a lawyer. However, under the influence of\nhis mother and her confessor, Jean Duvergier, the abb\u00e9 de\nSaint-Cyran\u00b8 he changed his mind and began studies in\ntheology in 1633.\n\nAbout 1640, he joined a small group of solitaires who lived\nin the countryside near Port-Royal and were associated with the\nconvent. They included Pierre Nicole, Claude Launcelot, and Sacy. The\nsolitaires initiated the petites \u00e9coles de\nPort-Royal which continued in various locations from the late\n1630s until 1660. Their students included the dramatist Jean Racine.\nLater on, Arnauld cooperated with Sacy in the first important French\ntranslation of the\n Bible.[1]\n He also co-authored the Grammaire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et\nraisonn\u00e9e with Lancelot and La Logique ou l\u2019Art\nde penser (hereinafter Logic), with Nicole. All of these\ncollaborative projects had their origins in the petites\n\u00e9coles. Blaise Pascal was closely associated with the\nsolitaires beginning in 1655.\n\nThe year 1641 was an eventful one for Arnauld. He was ordained a\npriest on September 21. During the year, he completed the\n\u201cFourth Objections\u201d to Descartes\u2019\nMeditations and wrote De la Fr\u00e9quente\ncommunion (published in 1643). The first work established his\nreputation as a philosopher. The second went through many editions and\nhad an effect on Catholic sacramental practice up to the end of the\nnineteenth century. Jansen\u2019s Augustinus was also\npublished in Paris in 1641, having been published posthumously in the\nNetherlands a year earlier. It was attacked by the official theologian\nof Paris, Isaac Habert, who preached a series of sermons against\nJansen in the cathedral of Paris during Lent, 1643. Arnauld, who had\narrived at an interpretation of Augustine similar to, though not\nidentical with, that of Jansen, undertook, at the request of\nSaint-Cyran, to defend Jansen against the accusation of heresy. This\nhe did in his Premi\u00e8re Apologie pour Jans\u00e9nius,\n1644, and Seconde Apologie, 1645. Although Arnauld did not\nagree with important details of Jansen\u2019s view, he continued to\ndefend Jansen against the charge of heresy off and on for the rest of\nhis life.\n\nIn 1653 the famous five propositions attributed to Jansen were\ndeclared to be heretical by Pope Innocent X in the Constitution\n\u201cCum Occasione.\u201d Arnauld and most of the\nPort-Royal group claimed that the five propositions, although\nheretical on their most likely interpretation, were not in fact in\nJansen\u2019s work. The dispute led to Arnauld\u2019s expulsion from\nthe Sorbonne after a celebrated trial, which lasted from December 1,\n1655 to January 30, 1656. Pascal came to Arnauld\u2019s defense with\nthe Provincial Letters, published in installments from\nJanuary 23, 1656 to May, 1657. The dispute lasted until 1669, when the\nFrench bishops who supported Arnauld worked out a compromise with Pope\nClement IX, and Arnauld enjoyed almost a decade in the good graces of\nboth the court and the Pope. During this time, Arnauld wrote\nvoluminously on the Eucharist, but he also found time to co-author the\nPort-Royal Grammar and Logic, and to write his\nNouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie.\nHowever, in the late 1670s, the attacks on Port-Royal by civil and\nreligious authorities resumed, and in 1679 Arnauld fled to the\nNetherlands, where he remained until his death, in Li\u00e8ge, on\nAugust 8, 1694.\n\nThe last fifteen years of Arnauld\u2019s life, spent in self-imposed\nexile, were among his most fruitful in philosophy. During this period,\nhe carried on his debates with Malebranche and Leibniz, and also\nreexamined his position on human free will. Arnauld\u2019s published\ncriticism of Malebranche began in 1683 with On True and False\nIdeas (hereinafter Ideas). But the central topic of the\nexchange was Malebranche\u2019s use of occasionalism to explain how\nit is that not all human beings are saved. Arnauld provided a\nsystematic criticism of that position in the three volumes of\nR\u00e9flexions philosophiques et th\u00e9ologiques sur le\nnouveau syst\u00e8me de la nature et de la gr\u00e2ce\n(hereinafter R\u00e9flexions), published in 1685 and 1686.\nArnauld\u2019s famous correspondence with Leibniz was initiated by\nLeibniz in 1686, when he sent Arnauld the section headings of his\nprojected Discourse on Metaphysics.\n",
