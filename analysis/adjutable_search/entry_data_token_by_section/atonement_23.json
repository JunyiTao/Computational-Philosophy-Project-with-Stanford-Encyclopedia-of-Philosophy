    "main_text": "Recent Theories || Mashup Theories\n5.5 Mashup Theories\n\nMany people want to combine elements of different theories into one\nlarger theory. Sometimes this is done by centering one theory while\nbuilding elements of other theories around it (e.g., Packer 1974, who\ncenters penal substitution). But one could also attempt to bring\nseveral theories together without centering any one. Crisp (2020a)\ncalls these \u201cmashup theories\u201d. Examples include Boersma\n(2004; 2006), who uses Irenaeus\u2019s notion of recapitulation to\ntie together Christus Victor, penal substitution, and moral influence,\nand McNall (2019), who tries to integrate the same theories together\nusing the metaphor of a mosaic in which each theory depicts part of a\nmosaic of Christ. Some have objected to mashup theories on the grounds\nthat each theory has a different internal logic\u2014a different\n\u201ctarget\u201d of atonement\u2014and purports to present a\ncentral mechanism for how Christ atones (Weaver 2006). Baker and Green\nendorse a kaleidoscope approach to theories of atonement which,\nalthough superficially similar to mashup theories, regards all\ntheories as culturally conditioned and limited, although valuable,\nways to understand Christ\u2019s atonement (Baker & Green 2011;\nGreen 2006). Others have defended the mashup approach. Gunton (1989)\nconstrues the classic atonement theories as built around different\nguiding metaphors that can and should be combined to provide a fuller\nunderstanding of Christ\u2019s atonement. Thurow (2021b) argues that\nsince atonement aims at reconciliation, and there are various\ndimensions to reconciling, a theory of atonement could view different\nclassic theories as articulating different dimensions of atonement\ncorresponding to unique dimensions of reconciliation.\n",
