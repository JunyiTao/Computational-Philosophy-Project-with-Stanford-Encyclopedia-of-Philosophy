    "main_text": "Epistemology\n3. Epistemology\n\nThe metaphysics of artifacts is a fairly well delineated set of\ndiscussions, carried out by a fairly cohesive group of philosophers.\nIn contrast, the epistemology of artifacts is more interdisciplinary\nin nature, ranging over anthropology, archaeology, cognitive science,\nand psychology, in addition to philosophy. Within philosophy it runs\nthe gamut from environmental philosophy to philosophy of mind.\n Section 3.1\n returns in more detail to the methodological considerations already\nbroached in\n Section 2.2.\n Section 3.2 takes up issues concerning artifacts as objects of\nknowledge. Finally,\n Section 3.3\n covers issues arising in studies of cognition in which artifacts are\npresented as playing significant and sometimes controversial roles in\ncognitive processes themselves.\n",
