    "main_text": "Supervenience and Other Relations || Supervenience and Entailment\n3.2 Supervenience and Entailment\n\nIs supervenience a form of entailment? The two relations are logically\nsimilar in certain ways. The entailment relation is reflexive,\ntransitive, and non-symmetric, and so is supervenience. Supervenience\nis reflexive: for any set of properties A, there cannot be an\nA-difference without an A-difference (see, e.g., Kim\n1984). It is also transitive: if A-properties supervene on\nB-properties, and B-properties supervene on\nC-properties, then A-properties supervene on\nC-properties. However, supervenience is neither symmetric nor\nasymmetric; it is non-symmetric. Sometimes it holds\nsymmetrically. Every reflexive case of supervenience is trivially a\nsymmetric case; consider also the case of the volume and surface area\nof perfect spheres mentioned in\n Section 3.1.\n And sometimes it holds asymmetrically. For example, while the mental\nmay supervene on the physical, the physical does not supervene on the\nmental. There can be physical differences without mental differences.\nOne uncontroversial way to see this is to note that radically\nphysically different things\u2014a washing machine and a paper bag,\nsay\u2014can be mentally just alike in virtue of lacking mental\nproperties altogether. Thus supervenience, like entailment, is\nreflexive, transitive, and non-symmetric.\n\nNonetheless, that B-properties entail A-properties\nis neither necessary nor sufficient for A-properties to\nsupervene on B-properties. (The notion of property entailment\nin play is this: property P entails property Q just\nin case it is metaphysically necessary that anything that possesses\nP also possesses Q.) To see that such entailments do\nnot suffice for supervenience, consider the properties being a\nbrother and being a sibling. Possessing the former\nentails possessing the latter; every brother is a sibling. But\nbeing a sibling does not supervene on being a\nbrother. Two people can differ with respect to being a sibling\ndespite being exactly alike with respect to being a brother. To see\nthis, suppose that Sarah has a sister and Jack is an only child. Thus\nSarah is a sibling and Jack is not, though neither is a brother. So\nthe B-properties can entail the A-properties, even\nthough A does not supervene on B.\n\nTo see that supervenience does not suffice for entailment, recall that\nsupervenience can hold with only nomological necessity. In such cases,\nthere is no entailment; thermal conductivity properties do not\nentail electrical conductivity properties, for example.\n\nBut what about supervenience with metaphysical or\nlogical necessity? Even that does not in general guarantee\nthat there are B-properties that entail the\nA-properties. At best, the logical supervenience of\nA on B means that how something is B-wise\nentails how it is A-wise. But it does not follow that every\nA-property is entailed by a B-property, or even that\nsome A-property is entailed by a B-property.\nConsider two examples. First, on the assumption that there are\nnegative properties, every property F will supervene with\nlogical necessity on its complement not-F. After all, two\nthings cannot differ with respect to whether they are F\nwithout differing with respect to whether they are not-F, and\nconversely. But obviously being F does not entail being\nnot-F (McLaughlin 1995, 1997a). Second, consider a case in\nwhich the property set B contains only the property\nP and the property Q, and property set A is\nthe unit set of the conjunctive property P&Q.\nThat is, A = {P&Q}, and B =\n{P, Q}. A supervenes with metaphysical\nnecessity on B. But there is no property in B that\nentails the A-property.\n\nNow, there might be special sets of properties for which the\nsupervenience of A on B guarantees that there are\nB-properties that entail the\nA-properties\u2014namely, property sets that are closed\nunder the Boolean operations of complementation, infinitary\nconjunction, infinitary disjunction (see Kim 1984), and operations\ninvolving quantification. Closing {F} and {~F} under\nthese operations will result in the same set, namely {F,\n~F, F & ~F, F v\n~F\u2026}. In both cases just above, then, the\nclosure of B under these operations in fact contains\na property that entails the A-property.\n\nDiscussions of supervenience often appeal to property sets that are\nclosed under such operations. But this is not a trivial assumption,\nfor two reasons. First, it is controversial whether complementation,\nconjunction, and disjunction are legitimate property-forming\noperations. Whether they are largely depends upon what properties are\ntaken to be. If properties are just the semantic values of predicates,\nthen there are negative, conjunctive, and disjunctive properties,\nbecause negative, conjunctive, and disjunctive predicates can have\nsemantic values. But if properties are universals there may not be any\nsuch properties (Armstrong 1978, 1989). And if properties are ways a\nthing might be, then property sets cannot be closed under Boolean\noperations. That would entail that for any property F,\nbeing F and ~F is also a property. However,\nthat is not a way anything might be. (However, see Priest 2010 for an\nopposing view.) Second, even if it is assumed that the\nproperty-forming operations are legitimate, the fact is that we are\nquite often interested in property sets that are not closed under\nthem. Consider negation. Even assuming that there are negative\nproperties, the fact is that we do not standardly count cats as having\ngeological properties because they are neither ignaceous, sedimentary,\nnor metamorphic. And it seems strange to say that Descartes was\ncommitted to mental substances having physical properties simply\nbecause he thought they are not spatially extended. Since not every\nproperty set is closed under every property-forming operation,\nsupervenience is not in general sufficient for entailment. (For\nfurther discussion of supervenience and various property-forming\noperations, see Van Cleve 1990; Oddie and Tichy 1990; Bacon 1990,\n1995; Glanzberg 2001; Bader 2012.)\n\nOne particularly interesting case of entailment failure arises when\nthe property sets are not closed under quantification. This opens room\nfor cases in which the supervening set A contains properties\nformed by quantification, like being such that every F is a\nG, and the subvening set B does not. If B does\nnot include such properties, there are no properties in B\nthat entail them. As Bertrand Russell noted many years ago, \u201cyou\ncannot ever arrive at a general fact by [deductive] inference from\nparticular facts, however numerous\u201d (Russell 1918, 235; quoted\nin Bricker 2005). But general properties, nevertheless, logically\nsupervene on particular ones: no two possible worlds can differ in\nwhat general facts hold without differing in what particular facts\nhold (see Skyrms 1981, Lewis 1992, and Bricker 2005). Thus, general\nfacts logically supervene on particular facts, even though the latter\ndo not entail the former.\n\nThe upshot is that the logical supervenience of property set\nA on property set B will only guarantee that each\nA-property is entailed by some B-property if\nA and B are closed under both infinitary Boolean\noperations and property-forming operations involving\nquantification.\n",
