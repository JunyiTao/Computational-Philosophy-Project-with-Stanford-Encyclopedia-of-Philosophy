    "main_text": "\n\nMary Wollstonecraft (1759\u20131797) was a moral and political\nphilosopher whose analysis of the condition of women in modern society\nretains much of its original radicalism. One of the reasons her\npronouncements on the subject remain challenging is that her\nreflections on the status of the female sex were part of an attempt to\ncome to a comprehensive understanding of human relations within a\ncivilization increasingly governed by acquisitiveness and consumption.\nHer first publication was on the education of daughters; she went on\nto write about politics, history and various aspects of philosophy in\na number of different genres that included critical reviews,\ntranslations, pamphlets, and novels. Best known for her\nVindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her influence went\nbeyond the substantial contribution to feminism for which she is\nmostly remembered and extended to shaping the art of travel writing as\na literary genre; through her account of her journey through\nScandinavia as well as her writings on women and thoughts on the\nimagination, she had an impact on the Romantic movement.\n",
