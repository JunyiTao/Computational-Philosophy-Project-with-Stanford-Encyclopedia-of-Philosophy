    "main_text": "Semantic representation\n3. Semantic representation\n\nLanguage serves to convey meaning. Therefore the analysis of\nsyntactic structure takes us only partway towards mechanizing that\ncentral function, and the merits of particular approaches to syntax\nhinge on their utility in supporting semantic analysis, and in\ngenerating language from the meanings to be communicated.\n\nThis is not to say that syntactic analysis is of no value in\nitself\u2014it can provide a useful support in applications such as\ngrammar checking and statistical MT. But for the more ambitious goal\nof inferring and expressing the meaning of language, an essential\nrequirement is a theory of semantic representation, and how it is\nrelated to surface form, and how it interacts with the representation\nand use of background knowledge. We will discuss logicist approaches,\ncognitive science approaches, and (more briefly) emerging statistical\napproaches to meaning representation.\n",
