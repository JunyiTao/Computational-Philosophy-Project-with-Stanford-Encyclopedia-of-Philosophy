    "main_text": "The Classical Approach\n2. The Classical Approach\n\n\nThe Classical Utilitarians, Bentham and Mill, were concerned with\nlegal and social reform. If anything could be identified as the\nfundamental motivation behind the development of Classical\nUtilitarianism it would be the desire to see useless, corrupt laws and\nsocial practices changed. Accomplishing this goal required a\nnormative ethical theory employed as a critical tool. What is the\ntruth about what makes an action or a policy a morally good one, or\nmorally right? But developing the theory itself was also\ninfluenced by strong views about what was wrong in their society.\nThe conviction that, for example, some laws are bad resulted in\nanalysis of why they were bad. And, for Jeremy Bentham, what made\nthem bad was their lack of utility, their tendency to lead to\nunhappiness and misery without any compensating happiness. If a\nlaw or an action doesn't do any good, then it\nisn't any good.\n",
