    "main_text": "Organ Retrieval from Living Donors || Incompetent living donors\n2.4 Incompetent living donors\n\nAlthough rules and practices governing living donation have generally\nbecome more permissive in most respects, they have become stricter in\nthe case of incompetent donors (Price 2000). Only six living kidney\ndonations by minors were performed between 2000 and 2015 in the U.S.,\nfor example. Additionally, in the U.S., just 20 minors have donated a\nliver lobe or segment since 1987. In Europe, only three cases of\nliving kidney donation by minors have been reported, all involving\nadolescents and occurring in the U.K. prior to 2006 (Van Assche et\nal. 2016).\n\nAs the discussion above of psychosocial screening implies, competence\nis not always easily determined, but let us assume in this section\nthat we are considering clearly incompetent donors, namely\nrelatively young children and people with severe mental disabilities\nor illnesses.\n\nIf valid consent were a necessary condition of ethically permissible\norgan retrieval from the living, then retrieval from incompetent\ndonors would be wrong. However, it is not clear why consent should be\na necessary condition in all cases rather than only in those cases\nwhere people are capable of giving it.\n\nSeveral arguments have been given for permitting retrieval from\nincompetent people. Utilitarian arguments appear to permit retrieval\nbecause the donor loses less than the recipient gains. On the face of\nit, however, that argument would support organ conscription from\nliving competent people too. Some people have argued in specific cases\nthat the person would have wanted to donate, thus using the idea of\nsubstituted judgment familiar in other cases of deciding for\nincompetent patients. However, substituted judgment is misapplied in\ncases where the person is not, and never has been, competent (Buchanan\nand Brock 1990). More plausibly, it may be thought that, at least in\nsome cases, incompetent donors are not harmed by donating an organ. If\na child\u2019s donation would save the life of a sibling with organ\nfailure, the donor may gain in the psychosocial and vicarious senses\ndescribed above in the discussion of the \u201cdo no harm\u201d\nrule. Donors may be no worse off for donating, in which case organ\nretrieval would not infringe the \u201cdo no harm\u201d rule (T.M.\nWilkinson 2011).\n\nEven if organ retrieval from an incompetent donor were ethically\npermissible in a given case, it may be that policy considerations,\nsuch as the risk of abuse, would justify an outright ban. Some\nwriters, though, believe that legal safeguards would be enough to\nprotect incompetent donors from abuse (Munson 2002).\n",
