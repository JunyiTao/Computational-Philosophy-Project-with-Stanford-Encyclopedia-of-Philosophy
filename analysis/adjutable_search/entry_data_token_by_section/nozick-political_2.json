    "main_text": "Moral Rights and Side-Constraints || State of Nature Rights\n2.1 State of Nature Rights\n\nThese moral rights are understood as state of nature rights. That is,\nthey are rights that precede and provide a basis for assessing and\nconstraining not only the actions of individuals and groups but also\nthe conduct of political and legal institutions. These rights also\nprecede any social contract; they morally constrain the conduct of\nindividuals, groups, and institutions even in the absence of any\nsocial contract. In Locke\u2019s language, these rights constitute a\nlaw of nature\u2014or an especially important part of a law of\nnature\u2014that governs the pre-political and pre-contractual state\nof nature (Locke 1690: Second Treatise \u00a76).\n\nMoreover, to possess such a right is not merely to be in some\ncondition the promotion or maintenance of which is socially expedient.\nPart of the message of that opening proclamation is that there are\ncertain things that may not be done to individuals even if, by some\nstandard, they are socially optimizing. The rights that individuals\nhave are moral bulwarks against behavior that promotes even the most\nradiant\u2014or apparently radiant\u2014social end. In addition,\nthese state of nature moral rights are taken to be negative. They\nspecify types of conduct that may not be done to individuals rather\nthan types of conduct that must be done for people.\n\nFinally, since these rights are not granted by institutions, created\nby any contractual process, or accorded to individuals for the sake of\nadvancing some optimal social outcome, if they have any foundation,\nthat foundation must consist in some morally impressive fact about the\nnature of individuals qua individuals. Some morally\nimpressive fact about the nature of individuals\u2014e.g., that they\neach have ends or projects of their own to which they rationally\ndevote themselves\u2014must provide others with reason to not treat\nthem certain ways, e.g., as beings who ought to serve the ends of\nothers. We shall see that Nozick advances a claim of this sort in his\naccount of why agents should abide by moral side-constraints in their\nconduct toward others.\n\nRecourse to the familiar distinction between claim-rights and\nliberty-rights will enable us to be somewhat more precise about the\nstate of nature rights that Nozick ascribes to each individual.\nLiberty-rights are absences of obligations. You have a liberty-right\nto scratch your nose as long as you have no obligation not to.\nClaim-rights are moral (and enforceable) claims against others to\ntheir acting or not acting in certain ways. You have a claim-right\nagainst others not to be interfered with in the scratching of your\nnose if and only if others have an (enforceable) obligation\nnot to interfere with you in this way. Standardly, when we speak of\nrights we are speaking of composites of liberty-rights and\nclaim-rights. For instance, standardly, your right to scratch your\nnose consists in your having no obligation not to do so and others\nhaving (enforceable) obligations not to interfere with your doing so.\nYour moral liberty to scratch your nose is morally protected by your\n(enforceable) claim against others that they not interfere with your\ndoing so.\n\nWhen Nozick asserts that individuals possess pre-political,\npre-contractual moral rights against certain things being done to\nthem\u2014even for the sake of ends that are or purport to be\nsocially optimal\u2014he is most obviously ascribing claim-rights to\nindividuals correlative to which are pre-political and pre-contractual\nmoral obligations of each agent not to do certain\nthings to other individuals. Since, all state of nature obligations\n(that are rights-correlative and, hence, enforceable) are negative, in\nthe state of nature individuals are morally at liberty to engage in\nany conduct that does not transgress others\u2019 state of\nnature claim-rights. Thus, Nozick\u2019s opening proclamation of\nrights affirms for each individual extensive\nliberty-rights\u2014extensive freedom from obligations, especially\npositive obligations\u2014that are systematically protected against\ninterference by moral claim-rights. It needs to be mentioned that\nthese moral rights are taken to be people\u2019s baseline rights;\nthey are rights that are subject to contraction or expansion through\nan individual\u2019s actions and interactions. So, e.g., although\neach individual has a natural right against all others not to be\nstruck in her nose, each may waive that right by agreeing to take\nplace in a boxing match, and each may acquire a liberty-right to\nstrike the other party to the boxing contract.\n",
