    "main_text": "Basic Principles of Reality || Harmony\n2.2 Harmony\n\nAlready in Fragment 1, Philolaus appealed not just to limiters and\nunlimiteds in order to explain the world but asserted that the cosmos\nas a whole and everything in it only arose when limiters and\nunlimiteds were \u201charmonized\u201d or \u201cfitted\ntogether.\u201d Fragment 6 is even more explicit on the need for\nharmony:\n\n\u2026since these beginnings [i.e. limiters and unlimiteds]\npreexisted and were neither alike nor even related, it would not have\nbeen possible for them to be ordered, if a harmony had not come upon\nthem\u2026 Like things and related things did not in addition\nrequire any harmony, but things that are unlike and not even related\n\u2026 it is necessary that such things be bonded together by a\nharmony, if they are going to be held in an order.\n\n\nGraham suggests that harmony as a principle required to allow limiters\nand unlimiteds to combine prefigures Platonic participation and\nAristotelian ontological predication (Graham 2014: 53\u20134). In Fragment\n6a Philolaus goes on to describe this harmony and what he describes is\na musical scale, the scale known as the Pythagorean diatonic, which\nwas used later by Plato in the Timaeus in the construction of\nthe world soul. This scale provides Philolaus\u2019 only surviving explicit\nexample of the bonding together of limiters and unlimiteds by a\nharmony. A musical scale presupposes an unlimited continuum of\npitches, which must be limited in some way in order for a scale to\narise. The crucial point is that not just any set of limiters will do.\nWe cannot just pick pitches at random along the continuum and produce\na scale that will be musically pleasing. The scale that Philolaus\nadopts is such that the ratio of the highest to the lowest pitch is 2\n: 1, which produces the interval of an octave. That octave is in turn\ndivided into a fifth and a fourth, which have the ratios of 3 : 2 and\n4 : 3 respectively and which, when added, make an octave. If we go up\na fifth from the lowest note in the octave and then up a fourth from\nthere, we will reach the upper note of the octave. Finally the fifth\ncan be divided into three whole tones, each corresponding to the ratio\nof 9 : 8 and a remainder with a ratio of 256 : 243 and the fourth into\ntwo whole tones with the same remainder (for more on Fr. 6a see\nMcKirahan 2012 and Huffman 1993: 145\u2013165). Thus, in Philolaus\u2019\nsystem the fitting together of limiters and unlimiteds involves their\ncombination in accordance with ratios of numbers. Similarly the cosmos\nand the individual things in the cosmos do not arise by a chance\ncombination of limiters and unlimiteds; the limiters and unlimiteds\nmust be fitted together in a pleasing way in accordance with number\nfor an order to arise. Fragment 6a suggests that Philolaus saw the\ncosmos as put together according to the diatonic scale. This would be\nvery much in accord with the famous conception of the harmony of the\nspheres according to which the heavenly bodies make harmonious music\nas they move, but neither in Philolaus nor any other early source do\nwe get an explicit account of how the musical scale corresponds to the\nastronomical system (Huffman 1993, 279\u201383; Zhmud 2012: 343\u20134\ndenies that there was any connection between the harmony of the\nspheres and Philolaus\u2019 system ).\n\nMost scholars agree that Philolaus was not interested in harmonic\ntheory for its own sake as were Archytas, Aristoxenus and much later\nPtolemy (Barker 2007: 278\u2013286; Creese 2010: 104). There is also\nno evidence that he used a monochord in order to determine or\ndemonstrate harmonic relationships (Creese 2010: 104\u2013117).\nHowever, even if Philolaus\u2019 main interest was the application of\nharmonics to cosmology, the approach to harmonics found in Fragment 6a\nand in the disputed 6b and A26 has been of considerable interest to\nhistorians of harmonic theory, and their conclusions are highly\nrelevant to the issue of the authenticity of 6b and A26. By the end of\nthe fourth century there was a marked division between Pythagorean\nharmonic theorists who regarded musical intervals as corresponding to\nwhole number ratios and followers of Aristoxenus who regarded them as\nlinear magnitudes. For Aristoxenus the octave consisted of six equal\ntones added together and could be divided in half. For the\nPythagoreans the octave was made up of ratios which were combined not\nby addition but by multiplication (e.g. the octave [2 : 1] = the\nproduct of the fifth [3 : 2] and the fourth [4 : 3], not the sum). The\noctave was a little less than six tones (9 : 8), and neither it nor\nthe tone could be divided in halves. Fragment 6a of Philolaus mentions\nthe ratios that correspond to the intervals (e.g., the tone is 9 : 8)\nwhereas Fragment 6b and A26 present intervals as linear magnitudes\n(e.g., the tone is 27). Since 6a treats intervals as corresponding to\nratios in a properly Pythagorean way, it has usually been accepted as\nauthentic and the difference in approach found in 6b and A26 has been\nseen as incompatible with 6a and hence as indicative of their\nspuriousness. Recently some scholars, on the other hand, have\nsuggested that in Philolaus\u2019 time this split between regarding\nintervals as ratios and regarding them as linear magnitudes had not\nbeen fully developed and that Philolaus may have regarded the two\napproaches as compatible (Hagel 2009: 144; Creese 2010: 116, n. 119).\nBarker supports this point by arguing that Philolaus is employing both\napproaches already in Fragment 6a. Thus, while the fragment equates\ncertain ratios with certain intervals, Philolaus does nothing\nmathematically with those ratios and instead emphasizes that intervals\nhave size and can be combined to create the octave, which suggests\nthat he thinks of them as linear magnitudes (Barker 2007:\n264\u2013271). This same combination of intervals as ratios and\nintervals as linear magnitudes can be seen in Fragment 6b and A26,\nwhere there is the additional emphasis on halving intervals. The\nhalving of intervals seems to be directed at finding the mid-point of\nthe octave and this might have been important in Philolaus\u2019\napplication of the octave to the cosmos, where the center is important\nfor the symmetry of the whole system (Barker 2007: 277; cf. Hagel\n2009: 151). Moreover, Aristotle\u2019s description of fifth-century\nPythagoreanism seems to display the same odd mixture of ratios and\nindividual numbers (Barker 2007: 286). However, there are some\ndifficulties for this approach. While Fragment 6a does emphasize the\nsize of intervals and their combination to form the octave, size need\nnot mean linear magnitude and combination need not mean addition. In\nfact, no specific linear magnitudes (e.g. 27, which is equated with\nthe tone in A26) are mentioned. The only sizes of intervals mentioned\nare precisely the ratios. Nor is there any evidence in Fragment 6a of\nany interest on Philolaus\u2019 part in halving intervals. The situation is\nquite the reverse. He uniformly presents the octave and, indeed, all\nintervals as composed of unequal parts (e.g., the octave is composed\nof the fourth and the fifth). Thus, while it is impossible to deny\nthat Philolaus might have tried to embrace both concepts of the nature\nof a musical interval, Fragment 6a still differs from 6b and A26 in\nbeing totally intelligible on the assumption that intervals correspond\nto ratios and in making no overt use of linear magnitudes or halves of\nsuch magnitudes (Huffman 2012: 235; cf. McKirahan 2012).\n",
