    "main_text": "Necessity and Contingency || God\u2019s absolute and ordained power\n4.2 God\u2019s absolute and ordained power\n\nDivine omnipotence involves the absolute power to enact anything that\ndoes not involve a contradiction. But among the multitude of\npossibilities open to divine enactment, God chooses or ordains a\nsubset of compatible possibilities that constitute the world and its\nhistory as we know it. The relationship between God\u2019s absolute\npower and the ordained system in place at any given time provided a\nfault line for exploring questions of necessity and contingency.\nThirteenth century theologians formulated the relationship as one\nbetween what God has done and what he could have done otherwise,\nsafely relegating contingency to a now foreclosed past. Canon lawyers,\nhowever, appropriated the distinction to describe the powers of the\npope to set aside \u201cordained\u201d or enacted Church law through\nthe \u201cplenitude\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d power of his\noffice. Because papal power transcended enacted law, and popes (and\nmonarchs) who enacted laws were in some sense not subject to those\nlaws, they could provide for exceptions or change enacted laws without\ncontradiction. Such application of the distinction between absolute\nand ordained power raised the possibility that God might intervene in\nthe ordained system through his absolute power. Beginning with Scotus,\nthe formulation of the canonists began to enter into discussions of\nGod\u2019s exercise of absolute power. The appropriation of the legal\ntradition did not lead to the conclusion (at least for Scotus, Ockham\nand Holkot) that God uses his absolute power to act inordinately in\nthe ordained system, but rather it enables God (as it did in the\nchange from the Old to the New Law) to set aside one ordained system\nand replace it with another. Several different and incompatible\nsystems of divine legislation have operated at different times during\nhuman history. God\u2019s absolute capacity to transcend any given\nordained system and replace it with another has made such a switch\npossible without involving God in a contradiction of his nature.\nHolkot also invoked this dialectical relationship between God\u2019s\nabsolute and ordained power to explain how God provides for\ndispensations from his laws in particular cases. God never acts\ninordinately, but the system of divine ordinations is complex and\ninvolves multiple incompatible subsets capable of being in place at\nany given time (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 32\u201337).\n\nHolkot analyzed God\u2019s power in terms of sets of compatible\npropositions.\n\nIf all the propositions that can exist, were to exist, God cannot do\nwhat would entail contradictory propositions being true at the same\ntime, and He can do all those things that, having posed them perfectly\ninstantiated in being, entail no contradictory propositions being true\nat the same time. (Sent. II, q. 2, art. 6, f. i4va)\n\n\nHe then argued that talk of God\u2019s absolute and ordained power\nwas not about a two-fold power, but two ways of modifying the\nproposition: \u201cGod can produce A.\u201d The proposition\n\u201cGod can produce A from his ordained power,\u201d means that it\nis possible for God to produce A, and A will be compatible with his\nexisting statutes. The proposition \u201cGod can produce A from his\nabsolute power,\u201d means that it is possible for God to produce A\n(because A in itself entails no contradictory propositions being\nsimultaneously true), and A is not compatible with his existing\nstatutes. God has only one power, which is God himself, and which\nhuman beings can understand in two different ways: ordinately and\nabsolutely. (The stricture on propositional existence results from his\nview, which he shared with Ockham and a number of his contemporaries,\nthat only propositional tokens counted as real propositions capable of\nproducing a logical contradiction.)\n\nThe principle of non-contradiction served as the ultimate safeguard of\nrationality and certainty in Holkot\u2019s system. The role of the\nprinciple was particularly important because Holkot, more than perhaps\nany other late medieval theologian, underscored God\u2019s freedom to\nset aside ordained laws without incurring any fault or obstacle.\n\nGod can be obliged to no law but that without its observance he can be\nmorally good, because otherwise the divine goodness would depend on\ncreatures, and God would be less good than he is if he were to destroy\nevery creature; and similarly God would begin to be better than he was\nbefore the observance of the law. Whence, just as a prince who is\nabove the law can perform some act without sin or evil, which those\nexisting under the law in no way can do without sin, so God in not\nfulfilling what he promised acts without the evil of falsity or\nperjury, which someone existing under the law could in no way do\n(Quodl. III, q. 8, in Seeing the Future, 103, ll.\n537\u2013546).\n\n\nDivine promises, revelations, and enactments were all in\nHolkot\u2019s view ungrounded in divine goodness in the sense that\nGod was not under obligation because of his goodness to fulfill them\nor keep them in being. The contingency of the ordained system was a\nfact of the human condition. So what reassurance could human beings\nhave that keeping faith with God\u2019s precepts would result in\ntheir salvation? What would happen if God were to set aside the\ncurrent law and enact some incompatible alternative, as it would\nclearly seem to be in God\u2019s power to do? If God did not inform\npeople about such a change, then invincible ignorance would protect\nthem from being held accountable for not following the new laws.\nHolkot did not believe that God could ask people to obey laws of which\nthey were ignorant because that would require them to do what is\nimpossible and contradictory. And if God did inform people of the new\nlaws, then these laws would supersede the incompatible old set, and\nthe faithful could obey God without being held to contradictory\ncommands.\n",
