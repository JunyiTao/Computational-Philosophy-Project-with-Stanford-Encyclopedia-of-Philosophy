    "main_text": "Approaches to Feminism\n3. Approaches to Feminism\n\nImportant feminist philosophical work has emerged from all the current\nmajor philosophical traditions, including analytic philosophy,\ncontinental philosophy, and American pragmatist philosophy. It is also\nemerging from other new areas of inquiry, such as Latin American\nthought, which arises out of the context of colonialism. Entries in\nthe SEP under the heading \u201capproaches to feminism\u201d discuss\nthe impact of these traditions and constellations of thought on\nfeminist scholarship. The subsection also addresses how some work,\nsuch as psychoanalytic feminism, bridges two or more traditions. The\neditors of the feminist section of the SEP see these different\ntraditions as a rich array of methodologies rather than \u201ccontinental\ndivides.\u201d The array reflects a variety of beliefs about what kinds of\nphilosophy are both fruitful and meaningful. The different\nmethodologies bring their own ways of asking and answering questions,\nalong with constructive and critical dialogue with mainstream\nphilosophical views and methods and new topics of inquiry. \n\nAs the SEP continues to grow, we anticipate that this subsection on\napproaches to feminism will expand to address other traditions,\nincluding Black feminism. But for now, here are links to entries in\nthis subsection:\n\nanalytic feminism\ncontinental feminism\nLatin American feminism\npragmatist feminism\nintersections between pragmatist and continental feminism\nintersections between analytic and continental feminism\npsychoanalytic feminism\n\n\nThough not included along with these in the table of contents, another\nrelevant approach can be found in the entry on\n gender in Confucian philosophy.\n\nAll these approaches share a set of feminist commitments and an\noverarching criticism of institutions, presuppositions, and practices\nthat have historically favored men over women. They also share a\ngeneral critique of claims to universality and objectivity that ignore\nmale-dominated theories\u2019 own particularity and specificity.\nFeminist philosophies of almost any philosophical orientation will be\nmuch more perspectival, historical, contextual, and focused on lived\nexperience than their non-feminist counterparts. Unlike mainstream\nphilosophers who can seriously consider the philosophical conundrums\nof brains in a vat, feminist philosophers always start by seeing\npeople as embodied. Feminists have also argued for the reconfiguration\nof accepted structures and problems of philosophy. For example,\nfeminists have not only rejected the privileging of epistemological\nconcerns over moral and political concerns common to much of\nphilosophy, they have argued that these two areas of concern are\ninextricably intertwined. Part 2 of the entry on\n analytic feminism\n lays out other areas of commonality across these various approaches.\nFor one, feminist philosophers generally agree that philosophy is a\npowerful tool for, as Ann Garry states in that entry,\n\u201cunderstanding ourselves and our relations to each other, to our\ncommunities, and to the state; to appreciate the extent to which we\nare counted as knowers and moral agents; [and] to uncover the\nassumptions and methods of various bodies of knowledge.\u201d As\nsuch, philosophy is also a powerful tool for understanding how gender\nitself has been constructed, that is, why and to whose benefit it is\nto construct some people as lesser and less capable than others. Along\nthese lines, feminist philosophers are keenly attuned to male biases\nat work in the history of philosophy, such as those regarding\n\u201cthe nature of woman\u201d and supposed value neutrality, which\non inspection is hardly neutral at all. Claims to universality,\nfeminist philosophers have found, are usually made from a very\nspecific and particular point of view, contrary to their manifest\nassertions. Another orientation that feminist philosophers generally\nshare is a commitment to normativity and social change; they are never\ncontent to analyze things just as they are but instead look for ways\nto overcome oppressive practices and institutions.\n\nSuch questioning of the problems of mainstream approaches to\nphilosophy has often led to feminists using methods and approaches\nfrom more than one philosophical tradition. As Ann Garry notes in Part\n3 of the entry on\n analytic feminism\n (2017), it is not uncommon to find analytic feminists drawing on\nnon-analytic figures such as Beauvoir, Foucault, or Butler; and\nbecause of their motivation to communicate with other feminists, they\nare more motivated than other philosophers \u201cto search for\nmethodological cross-fertilization.\u201d Moreover, feminist\nphilosophers are generally inclined to incorporate the perspectives of\nall those who have been oppressed.\n\nEven with their common and overlapping orientations, the differences\nbetween the various philosophical approaches to feminism are\nsignificant, especially in terms of styles of writing, influences, and\noverall expectations about what philosophy can and should achieve.\nAnalytic feminist philosophy tends to value analysis and\nargumentation, though anyone trained in philosophy does so as well.\nContinental feminist theory puts more emphasis on interpretation and\ndeconstruction, and pragmatist feminism values lived experience and\nexploration. Coming out of a post-Hegelian tradition, both continental\nand pragmatist philosophers usually suspect that \u201ctruth,\u201d\nwhatever that is, emerges and develops historically. They tend to\nshare with Nietzsche the view that truth claims often mask power\nplays. Yet where continental and pragmatist philosophers are generally\nwary about notions of truth, analytic feminists tend to argue that the\nway to \u201ccounter sexism and androcentrism is through forming a\nclear conception of and pursuing truth, logical consistency,\nobjectivity, rationality, justice, and the good.\u201d (Cudd 1996:\n20).\n\nThese differences and intersections play out in the ways that various\nfeminists engage topics of common concern. One key area of\nintersection, noted by Georgia Warnke, is the appropriation of\npsychoanalytic theory, with Anglo-American feminists generally\nadopting object-relations theories and continental feminists drawing\nmore on Lacan and contemporary French psychoanalytic theory, though\nthis is already beginning to change as it becomes clearer that\ncontinental psychoanalytic theory is also interested, via Julia\nKristeva and Melanie Klein, in object-relations theory (see the entry\non\n intersections between analytic and continental feminism).\n The importance of psychoanalytic approaches is also underscored in\nShannon Sullivan\u2019s entry on\n intersections between pragmatist and continental feminism.\n Given the importance of\n psychoanalytic feminism\n for all three traditions, a separate essay on this approach to\nfeminist theory is included in this section.\n\nNo topic is more central to feminist philosophy than sex and gender,\nbut even here many variations on the theme flourish. Where analytic\nfeminism, with its critique of essentialism, holds the sex/gender\ndistinction practically as an article of faith (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender\n and Chanter 2009), continental feminists tend to suspect either (1)\nthat even the supposedly purely biological category of sex is itself\nsocially constituted (Butler 1990 and 1993) or (2) that sexual\ndifference itself needs to be valued and theorized (see especially\nCixous 1976 and Irigaray 1974).\n\nDespite the variety of different approaches, styles, societies, and\norientations, feminist philosophers\u2019 commonalities are greater\nthan their differences. Many will borrow freely from each other and\nfind that other orientations contribute to their own work. Even the\ndifferences over sex and gender add to a larger conversation about the\nimpact of culture and society on bodies, experience, and pathways for\nchange.\n",
