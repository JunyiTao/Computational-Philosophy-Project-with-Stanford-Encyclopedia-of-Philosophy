    "main_text": "The Logic of Counterfactuals || Philosophical Objections\n2.6 Philosophical Objections\n\nRecall Goodman\u2019s Problem\nfrom \u00a71.4: the truth-conditions of\ncounterfactuals intuitively depend on background facts and laws, but\nit is difficult to specify these facts and laws in a way that does not\nitself appeal to counterfactuals. Strict and similarity analyses make\nprogress on the logic of conditionals without directly confronting\nthis problem. But the discussion\nof \u00a7 2.5 makes salient a\nrelated problem. Lewis\u2019 (1979) System of\nWeights amounts to reverse-engineering a similarity relation to\nfit the intuitive truth-conditions of counterfactuals. While\nLewis\u2019 (1979) approach avoids\ncharacterizing laws and facts in counterfactual\nterms, Bowie (1979: 496\u2013497)\nargues that it does not explain why certain counterfactuals are true\nwithout appealing to counterfactuals. Suppose one asks why certain\ncounterfactuals are true and the similarity theorist replies with\nLewis\u2019 (1979) recipe for\nsimilarity. If one asks why those facts about similarity make\ncounterfactuals true, the similarity theorist cannot reply that they\nare basic self-evident truths about the similarity of worlds. Instead,\nthey must say that those similarity facts make those counterfactuals\ntrue. Bowie\u2019s (1979:\n496\u2013497) criticism is that this is at best uninformative,\nand at worst circular.\n\nA related concern is voiced by Horwich (1987:\n172) who asks \u201cwhy we should have evolved such a baroque\nnotion of counterfactual dependence\u201d, namely that captured\nby Lewis\u2019 (1979) System of\nWeights. The concern has two components: why would humans find it\nuseful, and why would human psychology ground counterfactuals in this\nconcept of similarity rather than our ready-at-hand intuitive concept\nof overall similarity? These questions are given more weight given the\ncentrality of counterfactuals to human rationality and scientific\nexplanation outlined in \u00a71. Psychological\ntheories of counterfactual reasoning and representation have found\ntools other than similarity more fruitful\n(\u00a71.2). Similarly, work on\nscientific explanation has not assigned any central role for\nsimilarity (1.3), and\nas H\u00e1jek (2014: 250) puts it:\n\n\nScience has no truck with a notion of similarity; nor does\nLewis\u2019 (1979) ordering of what\nmatters to similarity have a basis in science.\n\nMorreau (2010) has recently argued on\n formal grounds that similarity is poorly suited to the task assigned\n to it by the similarity analysis. The similarity analysis, especially\n as elaborated by D. Lewis (1979), tries\n to weigh some similarities between worlds against their differences\n to arrive at a notion of overall comparative similarity between those\n worlds. Morreau (2010: 471) argues\n that:\n\n\n[w]e cannot add up similarities or weigh them against differences. Nor\ncan we combine them in any other way\u2026 No useful comparisons of\noverall similarity result. (Morreau 2010:\n\u00a74)\n\n\narticulates this argument formally via a reinterpretation of\nArrow\u2019s Theorem in social choice theory. Arrow\u2019s Theorem\nshows that it is not possible to aggregate individuals\u2019\npreferences regarding some alternative outcomes into a coherent\n\u201ccollective preference\u201d ordering over those outcomes,\ngiven minimal assumptions about their rationality and autonomy. As\nsummarized in \u00a76.3\nof Arrow\u2019s\ntheorem, Morreau (2010) argues that\nthe same applies to aggregating respects of similarity and difference:\nthere is no way to add them up into a coherent notion of overall\nsimilarity.\n",
