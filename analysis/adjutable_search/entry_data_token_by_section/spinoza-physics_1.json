Overview of the Ethics as it bears on physical theory\n\nThe philosophical view that emerges from the Ethics, in so\nfar as it bears on physical theory, can be outlined as follows. God or\nNature is the unique substance (Ip14), existing essentially (Ip7),\ninfinite in power (Ip8), and characterized by infinite attributes,\neach constituting its essence (Id4). Finite things are but\nmodifications of that substance, and not themselves independent beings\n(Ip14); bodies in particular are modes of substance conceived under\nthe attribute Extension. God or Nature, as the ultimate cause of all\nthings, is also the cause of all the particular modifications of\nextended nature (Ip18). However, substance's power is not expressed\nthrough the operations of will and intellect; the one substance does\nnot act by conceiving a design in the intellect and bringing it to\nexistence through the will (Ip23cl, Appendix, I). Hence Nature is not\na teleological system, natural phenomena do not have purposes, and all\ncausation between modes is efficient, none final. Since things are\nconceived through their causes, and modes are conceived always through\nthe attribute to which they belong, there can be no trans-attribute\ncausation. Bodies and their modifications cannot cause ideas, and\nideas cannot cause modifications of bodies (IIp6). All modes are\nconceived through the substance in which they inhere; in this sense\nGod or nature is an indwelling cause of all things (Ip18). But the\nparticular modifications of Extension are causally necessitated\nentirely by the determining operation of prior modes of the same\nattribute, themselves so determined, ad infinitum (Ip28). The\nphysical domain is thus completely closed causally, impervious to\ninfluence from modes of other attributes and to intervention of divine\nwill, and fully deterministic (Ip29).\n\nThought is another attribute through which substance is conceived\n(IIp1). Since substance is unique, and the attributes simply various\nessences under which it is conceived, the series of finite modal\ncauses in each attribute must operate strictly in parallel with one\nanother (IIp7). For every modification of Thought there is a\nmodification of Extension it mirrors, and vice versa; and the causal\norder of the one is perfectly matched with that of the other. The\nmind, a finite mode of Thought, is, under this parallelism, simply the\nidea of the body to which it corresponds under the parallelism\n(IIp13). The economy of ideas is precisely as closed, necessitated and\ndeterministic as that of bodies.\n\nBodies are individuated one from the other, not by reason of\nsubstance, but rather by reason of motion and rest (IIp13sl1),\nindividual identity through time and change being a matter of the\ndynamic maintenance of a distinctive ratio of motion and rest of a\nbody's parts (IIp13s Def.). The human body is simply a particularly\ncomplex individual body, capable of maintaining its distinctive\nstructure through a wide variety of externally imposed modifications,\nand capable of forming corporeal images of those bodies that affect\nit. An affect that increases the body's ability to maintain its\ndistinctive ratio is paralleled in the mind by a modification that\nincreases that mind's power of thought, and the passage from lesser to\ngreater power is joy (IIIp11s, Affect Def. II). Modifications that\ndecrease the power of a body to maintain its individual ratio are\nparalleled by modifications decreasing the mind's power of thought,\nand such passages are sadness (IIIp11s, Affect Def. III). Further,\nindividuals, both minds and bodies, strive to persevere in their\nexistence as far as they can; that is to say, they strive to increase\nthe power by which they maintain their distinctive natures (IIIp6).\nBodies, then, have essences, which are powers of striving (IIIp7). The\ncausal interactions in which a body participates that are attributable\nto the action of that body increase its power of perseverance; it is\nin contrast passive with respect to those that diminish its power.\nEvidently, for Spinoza, strict necessitarian determinism is consistent\nwith a genuine distinction between action and passion, between doing\nand suffering an act.\n\nSeveral fundamental and distinctive issues of interpretation\npertaining to the physical arise from this picture. How are bodies to\nbe conceived, if not as independent substances? How are motion and\nrest to be conceived so as to make sense of the claim that bodies are\nindividuated by them? How are the principles of inertia and the\ncollision laws that follow from it to be accounted for, given that\nthey cannot be grounded in God's immutable will? What is the nature of\nthe individual striving of bodies, and how can it be reconciled with\nSpinoza's deterministic dynamics of Extension? These issues cannot be\naddressed independently of one another. The present discussion will\napproach them as they emerge from Spinoza's engagement with Cartesian\nphysics, beginning with the PCP\u2018s exposition of\nDescartes\u2019 views.\n",
