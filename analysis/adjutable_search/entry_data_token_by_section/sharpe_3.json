    "main_text": "Universals and Predication\n5. Universals and Predication\n\nThe core of Sharpe\u2019s metaphysics lies in his theory of\nuniversals. He is a realist, since he defends the extra-mental\nexistence of universals (ibid., p. 68), but he is open to\nnominalism, as he thinks that there is not a close correspondence\nbetween the elements and structures of language and elements and\nstructures of the world. His approach to the whole matter can be\ndefined as \u201canalytical,\u201d since he seems to believe that\n(i) any ontology has to be built up in relation to the resolution of\nsemantic problems, (ii) any philosophical explanation of reality has\nto be preceded by a semantic explanation of the function of our\nlanguage.\n\nSharpe wrote the most interesting treatise on universals of the late\nMiddle Ages other than those of Wyclif and Paul of Venice, arguing\nabout logic and metaphysics, explaining his positions on being and\nessence, universals, singulars, predication, identity and distinction,\nand truth and falsity. His tract is very similar to that of Paul of\nVenice with regard to many metaphysical theses supported, the\nstructure of the work, the textual material utilized, and the opinions\ndiscussed. In his Quaestio super universalia Sharpe lists\neight opinions on universals (Buridan, Ockham, Auriol, Albert the\nGreat and Giles of Rome, Plato, Duns Scotus, Burley, and Wyclif) and\nso does Paul of Venice in his Quaestio de universalibus\n(Ockham, Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, Auriol, Burley, Wyclif,\nPlato, and two other unidentified realist authors). Yet, there are\nsome noteworthy doctrinal differences between them and the other\nOxford realists, which testify to Sharpe\u2019s (and Paul of\nVenice\u2019s) independence of thought.\n\nThe starting point of Sharpe\u2019s theory of universals and\npredication (as well as identity and distinction) is the theory worked\nout by Wyclif and some of his Oxford successors, such as Alyngton and\nPenbygull. Like Duns Scotus and Walter Burley, Wyclif held that\nuniversals in re (or formal universals) exist outside our\nminds in actu and not in potentia, as moderate\nrealists thought. On the other hand, unlike Burley, he maintained that\nthey are really identical with their own individuals, thus accepting\nthe very core of the traditional realist account of the relationship\nbetween universals and individuals. According to Wyclif, since (1)\nuniversals and individuals share the same empirical reality, which is\nthat of individuals, but (2) have opposite constituent principles,\nwhen properly considered as universals and individuals, they are\nreally the same but formally distinct. On his view, because of this\nformal distinction, not everything predicable of individuals can be\ndirectly predicated of universals and vice versa, although an\nindirect predication is always possible. As a consequence, Wyclif\ndistinguished three main non-mutually exclusive types of predication\n(which he conceives as a real relation holding between metaphysical\nentities), each more general than the preceding one (or ones). In the\nTractatus de universalibus they are the following: formal\npredication, predication by essence, and habitudinal predication (see\nthe entry on Wyclif, \u00a72.3). Since habitudinal predication does\nnot require any kind of identity between the entity signified by the\nsubject-term and the entity signified by the predicate-term, but\nformal predication and essential predication do, the ontological\npresuppositions of the most general type of predication, implied by\nthe other types, are completely different from those of the other\ntwo.\n\nThe final result of this way of approaching the problem of universals\nwas a system of intensional logic where (1) the copula of (almost) any\nstandard (philosophical) proposition, such as \u2018Socrates is\nwhite\u2019 or \u2018man is an animal\u2019, has to be interpreted\nin terms of degrees of identity between the things signified by the\nsubject-term and the predicate-term; and (2) individuals and\nuniversals, considered qua beings, appear to be a sort of\nhypostatization of intensions, since they are what is signified by\nproper and common nouns respectively.\n\nSharpe shares the metaphysical view and principles of Wyclif\u2019s\nphilosophical system. His position on the problem of universals can be\nsummed up as follows.\n\nWe can count the following entities as universal: (1.1) those\ncauses that have a multiplicity of effects; (1.2) ideas in God; (1.3)\nthe universal quantifier (syncategorema universaliter\ndistributivum); (1.4) universal propositions, both affirmative\nand negative; (1.5) universal forms, or real universals ; and (1.6)\nuniversal signs, both mental and spoken (or written) (QsU.,\npp. 49\u201350).\nReal universals are naturally apt to be present in many things as\ntheir main metaphysical components.\nReal universals exist in actu outside the mind, since\ntheir being is the same as the being of individuals, which is\nactual.\nMental universals are partially caused in our mind by the common\nnatures existing outside.\n\n\nAs the being of real universals coincides with the being of their\ncorresponding individuals, real universals can be said to be\neverlasting because of the continuous succession of their individuals,\nand also really identical with them. But universals and individuals\nare also formally different from each other, as they have distinct\nconstitutive formal principles, and therefore different properties\n(ibid., pp. 91\u201392). The most important among universal\nsigns are mental universals, which are both the acts of intellection\nthrough which our mind grasps the nature of universal forms and the\nconcepts through which it connects general names with the things to\nwhich they refer (ibid., pp. 68\u201369).\n\nThe description of the relationship between universals and individuals\nin terms of real identity and formal distinction entails (i) that not\nall that is predicated of individuals can be directly\n(formaliter) attributed to their universals and vice\nversa, but (ii) that all that is predicated of individuals has to\nbe in some way or another attributed to universals and vice\nversa. Therefore, a redefinition of the standard kinds of\npredication was required.\n\nLike Alyngton, Penbygull, Tarteys, and Whelpdale, Sharpe modifies\nWyclif\u2019s theory. Agreeing with Alyngton, but against the others,\nhe divides real predication into formal predication (praedicatio\nformalis) and predication by essence (praedicatio essentialis\nvel secundum essentiam), removing habitudinal predication, as it\nis not homogeneous with the first two. According to him, predication\nby essence (1) shows a partial identity between the subject-thing and\nthe predicate-thing, which share some metaphysical component parts,\nand (2.1) does not require (or even (2.2) excludes) that the form\nconnoted by the predicate-term is directly present in the essence\nsignified by the subject-term. \u2018(What is) singular is (what is)\nuniversal\u2019 (\u2018singulare est universale\u2019) is\nan instance of predication by essence. Formal predication, on the\ncontrary, requires such a direct presence. \u2018Man is an\nanimal\u2019 and \u2018man is white\u2019 are instances of formal\npredication (ibid., pp. 89\u201391).\n\nAs is evident from his formulations, Sharpe does not explicitly divide\nformal predication into formal essential and formal accidental\npredication, and offers two different readings of the distinction\nbetween formal predication and predication by essence. According to\nthe common view, predication by essence is more general than formal\npredication. As a consequence, in the standard theory of the Oxford\nrealists, formal predication is a sub-type of predication by essence.\nSharpe introduces another interpretation, according to which the two\nkinds of predication at issue are complementary and mutually\nexclusive. This happens when predication by essence excludes the\nform connoted by the predicate-term being directly present in the\nessence signified by the subject-term (ibid., p. 91).\nAlthough, according to the latter reading, formal predication is not a\nkind of predication by essence, this reading nevertheless implies an\ninterpretation of the \u2018is\u2019 of predication in terms of\nidentity and, therefore, a new definition of the pair of antonymous\nnotions of identity and difference (or distinction).\n",
