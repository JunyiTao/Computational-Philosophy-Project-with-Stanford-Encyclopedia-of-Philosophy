Schiller\u2019s Response to Kant\u2019s Aesthetics: Grace, Dignity, and Aesthetic Education\n\nIn the history of ethics as well as aesthetics, mention of Kant is\noften quickly followed by mention of Friedrich Schiller\n(1759\u20131805), who criticized and developed Kant\u2019s views in both\nareas. Perhaps best known to the general public as the author of the\n\u201cOde to Joy\u201d (An die Freude) that provides the\ntext for the fourth movement of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth\nSymphony, as well as the source of materials for operas by Rossini\nand Verdi, in his lifetime Schiller was famous not only as a poet but\nalso as a dramatist, historian, and (at least during the first half\nof the 1790s ) as an aesthetician and philosopher. As a student in\nthe military college of the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg he trained as a\nphysician, and his earliest writings were on the mind-body\nrelationship. But he achieved instant fame with his play The\nRobbers (Die R\u00e4uber) in 1782, and then had to flee\nW\u00fcrttemberg in order to continue writing plays. Between 1783 and\n1787, he wrote Fiesko, Intrigue and Love\n(Kabale und Liebe), and Don Carlos. He met Goethe\nin 1787, and was professor of history in nearby Jena from 1789 to\n1799. During this period he wrote histories of the Thirty\nYears\u2019 War and the Dutch revolt against Spain. But he also\ndevoted several years in the early 1790s to an intensive study of\nKant, which then led to a series of essays including \u201cOn Grace\nand Dignity\u201d (\u00dcber Anmut und W\u00fcrde, 1793), Letters\non the Aesthetic Education of Mankind (1795), and \u201cOn\nNa\u00efve and Sentimental Poetry\u201d (1795\u20136), as well as the\nunpublished \u201cKallias\u201d letters on aesthetics (1793). After\nthis period, Schiller returned to his original calling, writing the\nhistorical dramas Wallenstein (1798\u20139), Maria\nStuart (1800), The Maiden of Orleans (Die Jungfrau\nvon Orleans, 1801), The Bride of Messina (1803),\nand Wilhelm Tell (1804). Like so many of the others who have\nbeen discussed here (Baumgarten, Sulzer, Herz, Moritz) his life was\ncut short by lung disease, presumably tuberculosis, and he died at\nforty-five in 1805.\n\n\nSchiller\u2019s \u201cKallias\u201d letters, written to his friend\nGottfried K\u00f6rner in January and February of 1793, were not\nhistorically influential, since they were not published for another\nhalf-century, but are fascinating reading today. In them Schiller\nargues that Kant\u2019s \u201csubjectivist\u201d conception of free play\nin aesthetic response has to be complemented with an\n\u201cobjectivist\u201d conception of beauty as the appearance of\nfreedom or self-determination in the object: a beautiful form\nis one that appears to us to be determined not by any forces outside\nof it but only by itself. For that reason \u201cA form is beautiful,\none might say, if it demands no explanation, or if\nit explains itself without a concept\u201d\n(\u201cKallias\u201d letter of 18 February 1793, p. 155).  Although\nSchiller does not mention his name, his theory could also be\ninterpreted as an attempt to refine Moritz\u2019s conception of beauty as\nthat which is complete within itself. Had Kant known these letters,\nhowever, he could have replied that Schiller\u2019s notions\nof appearing to be self- rather than other-determined\nand demanding no explanation are still subjective, that is,\nthey characterize how we respond to beautiful objects rather\nthan designating any properties that could be attributed to objects\nindependently of our response to them.\n\n\nUnlike the \u201cKallias\u201d letters, Schiller\u2019s essay \u201cOn\nNa\u00efve and Sentimental Poetry\u201d was immediately influential. Here\nSchiller describes the difference between \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and\n\u201csentimental\u201d art. The former is an expression of an\nimmediate emotional response to nature, where nature is thought of as\n\u201cthe subsistence of things on their own, being there according\nto their own immutable laws\u201d (a conception of nature that\nderives from the conception of beauty in the \u201cKallias\u201d\nletters). The latter self-consciously expresses a sense of our own\nseparation from nature and a feeling that the self-subsistent things\nin nature \u201care what we were\u201d and\n\u201cwhat we should become once more\u201d (\u201cNa\u00efve\nand Sentimental Poetry,\u201d pp.  180\u20131), or a longing for a\nwholeness with nature that we think humans once had but that we have\nlost. Schiller identifies na\u00efve poetry with antiquity and sentimental\npoetry (and the sense of alienation from nature it expresses) with\nmodernity.  This essay can be seen as the source for the genre of\nphilosophical histories of aesthetics that then flourished for several\ndecades, beginning with Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s \u201cOn the Study of\nGreek Poetry\u201d of 1797, continuing with Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph\nSchelling\u2019s lectures on The Philosophy of Art of\n1802\u20133, and culminating in the lectures on \u201cPhilosophy of\nArt or Aesthetics\u201d that Hegel gave in Berlin during the\n1820s\u2014lectures that decisively changed the sense of the name\n\u201caesthetics\u201d itself from its original meaning of a general\nscience of sensibility that included responses to nature as well as\nart to its modern meaning as the philosophy of art.\n\n\nHowever, the two theoretical works by Schiller with which philosophers\nhave most concerned themselves have been the 1793 essay \u201cOn\nGrace and Dignity\u201d and the epistolary series On the\nAesthetic Education of Man, first written as an actual series of\nletters to Schiller\u2019s patron the Danish Duke of Augustenberg in 1793\nand then rewritten for publication in 1795. These have typically been\nread as responses to Kant\u2019s moral philosophy, inspired by Kant in\ntheir general concern for autonomy as the essence of morality but\ncriticizing Kant for giving inadequate consideration to the r\u00f4le of\nsensibility in morality. \u201cOn Grace and Dignity\u201d has been\nheld to argue, in supposed opposition to Kant, for the necessity of\ndeveloping feelings as part of what it takes to comply fully with the\ndemands of morality, while Aesthetic Education has been read\nto argue that only the cultivation of aesthetic experience can\ntransform individuals and their society as morality demands; the first\nof these can be considered a constitutive claim, and the second a\ncausal claim. It will be argued here, on the contrary, that Kant\nactually makes greater claims for the significance and contribution of\nboth moral sentiments and aesthetic responses to the individual\nachievement of morality than Schiller does. Specifically, while\n\u201cOn Grace and Dignity\u201d argues that the moral determination\nof the will should be accompanied with certain moral sentiments on\nwhat are essentially aesthetic grounds, Kant argues that the\nvirtuous determination of the will should be accompanied by certain\nmoral sentiments on moral grounds. And while Aesthetic\nEducation asserts that the development of taste is a necessary\ncondition for the development of individual morality and social\njustice, which Kant never does, the variety of links that Kant\nrecognizes between aesthetics and morality, described in section\n7.2. above, show that the cultivation of taste can make a broader\ncontribution to the realization of morality than Schiller\nrealizes.\n",
