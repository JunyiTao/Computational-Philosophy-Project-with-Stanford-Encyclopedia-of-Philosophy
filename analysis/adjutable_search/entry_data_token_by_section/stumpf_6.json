Theory of Knowledge\n\nThe theory of knowledge occupies a central place in Stumpf\u2019s\nphilosophy in his later works, especially in Erkenntnislehre,\nand we know that this discipline has always been at the heart of his\nteaching up to the end of his career in Berlin. We saw that Stumpf\nassociates it both with the neutral sciences and the foundation of\nknowledge, specifically with the ultimate justification of knowledge.\n(Stumpf, 1939\u20131940, p. 7, 124) One of the central questions of\nthe theory of knowledge is psychologism, which is the main topic in\nStumpf\u2019s article \u201cPsychology and the Theory of\nKnowledge.\u201d (D. M\u00fcnch, 2002; G. Fr\u00e9chette, 2013)\nStumpf advocates a form of critical realism that he specifically\nopposes to Kantian idealism, and which maintains that the outside\nworld is always the object of a supposition or hypothesis. Moreover,\nhe claims that the only material that we have for formulating such an\nhypothesis are the concepts drawn from experience that enable us\n\u201cto calculate the course of events.\u201d One of the main tasks\nof the theory of knowledge, therefore, is to account for the most\ngeneral modes of knowledge of the outside world. (Stumpf, 1891, p.\n503) Stumpf distinguishes the theory of knowledge as a field of study\nfrom that of psychology on the basis of the cardinal distinction\nbetween the domain of concepts and that of propositions or necessary\ntruths, as elaborated in his habilitation thesis.\n\nInquiry on the origins of concepts, as we said, is a task specific to\npsychology. In contrast, the theory of knowledge is limited to the\nresearch and justification of \u201cthe most general and immediately\nevident truths\u201d (Stumpf, 1891, p. 501), such as laws and axioms\nnecessary for knowledge. Yet, these axioms are nothing but\npropositions that we assume to be true and necessary, and they have\ntheir origin in the content of a specific class of psychical\nfunctions, namely judgments. Since the contents of judgments are\nformations or products (Gebilde) which, as we said, belong to\neidology, the field of research of the theory of knowledge is\ntherefore linked to that of this neutral science which also includes\nstates of affairs. One must therefore avoid confusing the question\npertaining to the nature of axioms with that of the psychological\norigins of concepts, but one can no more entirely separate the theory\nof knowledge from descriptive psychology since axioms are originally\nthe contents of a specific class of psychical functions, i.e. the\ncontents of judgments or of propositional attitudes whose\njustification is the task of the theory of knowledge. (Stumpf, 1891,\np. 495\u2013496; 1939\u20131940, p 124)\n\nIn light of this distinction, one can better understand the\nsignificance of the debate on psychologism such as Stumpf describes it\nin his 1891 paper. Stumpf opposes two schools of thought on the\nquestion of the relationship between the theory of knowledge and\npsychology: Kantian criticism that dissociates the theory of knowledge\nfrom psychology, and psychologism which Stumpf defines in this paper\nas \u201cthe reduction of all philosophical investigation, and\nespecially all epistemological investigations, to psychology.\u201d\n(Stumpf, 1891, p. 468) The argument in favour of psychologism boils\ndown to the idea that \u201cknowledge is itself a mental process and\naccordingly the study of its conditions would be a psychological\ninvestigation.\u201d (Stumpf, 1891, p. 468) Critics of psychologism,\non the other hand, argue that a psychological investigation can never\nlead to \u201cknowledge of general and necessary truths.\u201d\n(Stumpf, 1891, p. 469) Now since the conditions of possibility of\nknowledge, i.e. the forms of intuition and thought, are themselves\na priori and therefore not analysable (Stumpf, 1891, p. 493),\npsychology is therefore useless for Kantian criticists.\n\nThe position adopted by Stumpf in this debate consists in conceding to\ncriticism that necessary truths are irreducible to facts while\nadmitting, with psychologists, that psychology is essential to the\ntheory of knowledge. Hence the main mistake he attributes to\nKantianism, which consists in refusing the assistance of psychological\nresearch in the theory of knowledge. (Stumpf, 1891, p. 493, 500) The\nfield of psychology is understood here in a sense that is broad enough\nas to include sensory phenomena and mental functions because, in 1891,\nStumpf did not explicitly distinguish the field of phenomenology from\nthat of descriptive psychology. Now the main criticism he addresses to\nKant focuses on the dichotomy between form and matter, and it is\nprimarily the Kantian doctrine of phenomena (the manifold of\nintuition) that he holds responsible for its most obvious\n\u201cmistakes.\u201d In this article, Stumpf reiterates the main\ncriticism that he addressed to Kant in his Raumbuch, namely\n\u201cthe doctrine of space as a subjective form and the Kantian\nconception of sensations as amorphous and unstructured matter designed\nto support the synthetic and unifying activity of the\nunderstanding.\u201d (Stumpf, 1873, p. 15 f.)\n\nHowever, this criticism of the Kantian theory of knowledge does not\nmake Stumpf an advocate of psychologism. For Stumpf acknowledges with\ncritical philosophy that we must maintain a strict concept of\nnecessity and thus oppose the reduction of the principles and laws of\nlogic and of science in general to simple empirical generalizations.\nStumpf here refers explicitly to J. S. Mill, and maintains that the\nlaws of nature and the principles of logic such as the principle of\nnon-contradiction, for example, cannot be obtained merely by induction\nand are irreducible as such to the process of empirical generalization\nor \u201can accumulation of observations.\u201d (Stumpf, 1891, p.\n499\u2013500) This raises the question as to what is the relationship\nbetween the position adopted by Stumpf in his 1891 article on the\ndebate on psychologism and the position adopted by Husserl and Frege\non the same issue several years later. M\u00fcnch (2002, p. 50) argues\nthat Stumpf\u2019s position not only comes close to that of Husserl,\nbut it also constitutes the background of Husserl\u2019s critique of\npsychologism in his Logical Investigations. Ewen (2008, pp.\n13, 22) argues instead that Stumpf is closer to the\nanti-psychologistic positions of Frege. But since they do not provide\na clear definition of what is meant by \u201cpsychologism\u201d and\ndo not clearly present Stumpf\u2019s, Frege\u2019s, and\nHusserl\u2019s respective arguments against psychologism, there is no\nway to settle this debate at the moment. (D. Fisette, 2015a)\n\nThat being said, there are parallels that can be drawn between the\npositions of Stumpf and of Frege on the foundations of mathematics and\non psychologism. (see W. Ewen, 2008, p. 97 f.) Several attempts have\nbeen recently made to explain these parallels, and these accounts all\nfocus on their mutual relationship with Lotze during their stay in\nG\u00f6ttingen in the early 1870s, while Stumpf, after his\nhabilitation, was Privatdozent (1870\u20131873), and Frege pursued\nhis studies in mathematics (1871\u20131873). Although it can be\nassumed that the two philosophers met during this period, we have no\nwritten evidence that confirms this. (W. Ewen, 2008, p. 97 f.)\nHistorical testimony does not say whether Frege attended\nStumpf\u2019s lectures in G\u00f6ttingen on Aristotle\u2019s\nmetaphysics, which he taught for three consecutive years, or his\nlectures on \u201cinductive logic with a particular focus on the\nproblem of natural science\u201d that he taught during the summer\nsemester of 1873. Nevertheless, the correspondence that Frege and\nStumpf exchanged in the early 1880s seems to testify that the two\nphilosophers knew each other. In any case, an explanation of the\nelective affinities between Stumpf and Frege might be found in the\nwork of Lotze. (Stumpf, 1918, p. 7; D. Fisette, 2015a)\n",
