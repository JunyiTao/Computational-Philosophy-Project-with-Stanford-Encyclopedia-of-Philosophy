(1975) present a classic example of Simpson\u2019s\nParadox involving a study of gender discrimination at Berkeley. The\ndata revealed that men were more likely than women to be accepted to\nthe university\u2019s graduate programs, but the authors were unable\nto detect a bias towards men in any individual department. The authors\nuse the paradox to explain why the higher university-wide acceptance\nrate for men does not show that any department discriminated against\nwomen. Specifically, women were more likely to apply to departments\nwith lower acceptance rates. This leads to a probabilistic association\nbetween gender and the partitioning variable (department), which we\nhave seen can lead to Simpson\u2019s reversals.\n\nWhile the probabilistic structure of the Berkeley case is similar to\nother instances of the paradox, it raises an additional question. On a\nnatural way to understand the case, the applicant\u2019s gender is a\ncause of his or her applying to a more or less selective departments.\nExactly what it means for demographic variables such as gender or race\nto be a cause is a longer story for another day (Glymour & Glymour\n2014; Sen & Wasow 2016). But assuming that gender is a cause here,\nthen the department variable is a mediator, and one should\nnot condition on mediators in evaluating the mediated causal\nrelationship. So what is the justification for conditioning on\ndepartment?\n\nThe answer is that in evaluating discrimination, what often matters\nare path-specific effects, rather than the net effect\nalong all paths (Pearl 2000 [2009: 4.5.3]; Zhang & Bareinboim\n2018). To give a different example (Pearl 2001), consider whether a\nhypothetical black job candidate was discriminated against based on\nher race. It is possible that as a result of prior racial\ndiscrimination, the candidate was denied opportunities to develop\njob-relevant qualifications, and as a result of lacking these\nqualifications was denied the job. This indirect effect of race hiring\nwould not be relevant for determining whether an employer\ndiscriminated against the candidate. Rather, what matters is whether\nthe employee would have been more likely to get the position had she\nbeen white, but had the same qualifications that she does as a result\nof being black. This is called the natural direct\neffect (Pearl 2001; Weinberger 2019). In determining whether\nthe employer discriminated, what matters is not whether being black\nmade any difference in the person\u2019s being hired, but\nrather whether their being black had a direct influence not via their\njob-relevant qualifications.\n",
