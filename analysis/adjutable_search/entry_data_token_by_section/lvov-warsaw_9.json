    "main_text": "Philosophy of Science\n4. Philosophy of Science\n\nThe philosophy of science was a favourite field of the LWS. Since\nscience is the most rational human activity, it was important to\nexplain its rationality and unity. Since most philosophers of the LWS\nrejected naturalism in the humanities and social sciences, the way\nthrough the unity of language (as in the case of the Vienna Circle)\nwas excluded. The answer was simple: science qua science is rational\nand is unified by its logical structure and by definite logical tools\nused in scientific justifications. Thus, the analysis of the\ninferential machinery of science is the most fundamental task of\nphilosophers science. Inductivism was a prevailing view about\njustification in empirical science. Hosiasson formulated an axiomatic\nsystem of inductive logic, anticipating Carnap\u2019s later work.\nOther attempts to establish the foundations of inductive inference\nwere undertaken by Ajdukiewicz (via statistics, decision theory and\ngame theory (he mainly investigated the problem of the rationality of\nmodes of fallible inference), Cze\u017cowski (via probability logic in\nthe sense of Reichenbach) and Zawirski (via a combination of\nmany-valued logic and probability theory).\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz worked on problems of the methodology of the\nempirical sciences in 1902\u20131910. At first, he tried to develop\nthe inverse theory of induction (induction as inversed deduction)\nproposed by Jevons and Sigwart. However, he abandoned this project\nvery soon and adopted a radical deductionist standpoint. For him,\ninduction plays no significant role in science. Deduction remains the\nonly credible mode of reasoning in all spheres of science. As applied\nin empirical science, it leads to negative results; that is, it can\nshow that some hypotheses are false in the face of empirical data.\n\u0141ukasiewicz also offered a formal argument against induction\nderived from probability theory. Assume that H is a universal\nhypothesis. Its a priori probability is equal (or close) to zero and\nno further empirical data can increase it. These ideas contain the\nmain points of Popper\u2019s philosophy of empirical science.\n\nTarski\u2019s semantic ideas converted most members of the LWS to\nscientific realism. Formerly, under the influence of conventionalism,\ninstrumentalism concerning scientific theories had adherents\n(Ajdukiewicz, \u0141ukasiewicz). A radical form of anti-realism was\ndeveloped by Pozna\u0144ski and Wundheiler in the 1930s. They pointed\nout that verification in empirical science is cyclic and principally\nanti-fundamentalistic. In particular, it is not possible to identify\nany data without a reference to theories. Hence, truth in science\ncannot consist in a correspondence with facts.\n\nOf many investigations concerning special problems, let me only\nmention Mehlberg\u2019s version of the causal theory of time and some\nworks on the causality problem in quantum mechanics. He admitted a\nuniversal time as a synthesis of physical (intersubjective) and\npsychical (subjective) time. The causal theory does not lead to the\nanisotropy of time. It can be that universal time is symmetric, but\nlocally asymmetry is possible. Mehlberg and Zawirski defended a\nmoderate causalism in quantum mechanics. In particular, Zawirski\nargued that the unpredictability of the future (Heisenberg) does not\nentail that the principle of causality fails.\n",
