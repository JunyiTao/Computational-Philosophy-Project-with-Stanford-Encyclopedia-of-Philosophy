    "main_text": "Two Kinds of Analysis of the Concept || Polythetic approaches\n2.2 Polythetic approaches\n\nThat a concept always corresponds to something possessing a defining\nproperty is a very old idea. This assumption undergirds Plato\u2019s\nEuthyphro and other dialogues in which Socrates pushes his\ninterlocutors to make that hidden, defining property explicit, and\nthis pursuit has provided a model for much not only of philosophy, but\nof the theorizing in all fields. The traditional assumption is that\nevery entity has some essence that makes it the thing it is, and every\ninstance that is accurately described by a concept of that entity will\nhave that essence. The recent argument that there is an alternative\nstructure\u2014that a concept need not have necessary and sufficient\ncriteria for its application\u2014has been called a \u201cconceptual\nrevolution\u201d (Needham 1975: 351), \u201cone of the greatest and\nmost valuable discoveries that has been made of late years in the\nrepublic of letters\u201d (Bambrough 1960\u20131: 207).\n\nIn discussions of the concept religion, this\nanti-essentialist approach is usually traced to Ludwig Wittgenstein\n(1953, posthumous). Wittgenstein argues that, in some cases, when one\nconsiders the variety of instances described with a given concept, one\nsees that among them there are multiple features that \u201ccrop up\nand disappear\u201d, the result being \u201ca complicated network of\nsimilarities overlapping and criss-crossing\u201d (Wittgenstein 1953,\n\u00a768).  The instances falling under some concepts lack a single\ndefining property but instead have a family resemblance to each other\nin that each one resembles some of the others in different ways. All\npolythetic approaches reject the monothetic idea that a concept\nrequires necessary and sufficient criteria. But unappreciated is the\nfact that polythetic approaches come in different kinds, operating\nwith different logics. Here are three.\n\nThe most basic kind of polythetic approach holds that membership in a\ngiven class is not determined by the presence of a single crucial\ncharacteristic. Instead, the concept maps a cluster of characteristics\nand, to count as a member of that class, a particular case has to have\na certain number of them, no particular one of which is required. To\nillustrate, imagine that there are five characteristics typical of\nreligions (call this the \u201cproperties set\u201d) and that, to be\na religion, a form of life has to have a minimum of three of them\n(call this the \u201cthreshold number\u201d). Because this\nillustration limits the number of characteristics in the properties\nset, I will call this first kind a \u201cbounded\u201d polythetic\napproach. For example, the five religion-making characteristics could\nbe these:\n\nbelief in superempirical beings or powers,\nethical norms,\nworship rituals,\nparticipation believed to bestow benefits on participants,\nand\nthose who participate in this form of life see themselves as a\ndistinct community.\n\n\nUnderstanding the concept religion in this polythetic way\nproduces a graded hierarchy of\n instances.[9]\n A form of life that has all five of these characteristics would be a\nprototypical example of a religion. Historically speaking,\nprototypical examples of the concept are likely to be instances to\nwhich the concept was first applied. Psychologically speaking, they\nare also likely to be the example that comes to mind first to those\nwho use the concept. For instance, robins and finches are prototypical\nexamples of a bird, and when one is prompted to name a bird, people\nare more likely to name a robin or a finch than an ostrich or a\npenguin. A form of life that has only four of these characteristics\nwould nevertheless still be a clear example of a\n religion.[10]\n If a form of life has only three, then it would be a\nborderline example. A form of life that has only two of these\ncharacteristics would not be included in the category, though such\ncases might be considered \u201cquasi-religions\u201d and they might\nbe the most interesting social forms to compare to religions (J. E.\nSmith 1994). A form of life that only had one of the five\ncharacteristics would be unremarkable. The forms of life that had\nthree, four, or five of these characteristics would not be an\nunrelated set but rather a \u201cfamily\u201d with multiple shared\nfeatures, but no one characteristic (not even belief in superempirical\nbeings or powers) possessed by all of them. On this polythetic\napproach, the concept religion has no essence, and a member\nof this family that only lacked one of the five\ncharacteristics\u2014no matter which one\u2014would still\nclearly be a\n religion.[11]\n As Benson Saler (1993) points out, one can use this non-essentialist\napproach not only for the concept religion but also for the\nelements within a religion (sacrifice, scripture, and so on) and to\nindividual religions (Christianity, Hinduism, and so on).\n\nSome have claimed that, lacking an essence, polythetic approaches to\nreligion make the concept so vague that it becomes useless\n(e.g., Fitzgerald 2000: 72\u20133; Martin 2009: 167). Given the\nfocused example of a \u201cbounded\u201d approach in the previous\nparagraph and the widespread adoption of polythetic approaches in the\nbiological sciences, this seems clearly false. However, it is true\nthat one must pay attention to the parameters at work in a polythetic\napproach. Using a properties set with only five elements produces a\nvery focused class, but the properties set is simply a list of\nsimilarities among at least two of the members of a class, and since\nthe class of religions might have hundreds of members, one could\neasily create a properties set that is much bigger. Not long after\nWittgenstein\u2019s death, a \u201cbounded\u201d polythetic\napproach was applied to the concept religion by William\nAlston who identified nine religion-making\n characteristics.[12]\n Southwold (1978) has twelve; Rem Edwards (1972) has fourteen and\nleaves room for more. But there is no reason why one might not work\nwith a properties set for religion with dozens or even\nhundreds of shared properties. Half a century ago, Rodney Needham\n(1975: 361) mentions a computer program that sorted 1500 different\nbacterial strains according to 200 different properties. As J. Z.\nSmith (1982: ch. 1) argues, treating the concept religion in\nthis way can lead to surprising discoveries of patterns within the\nclass and the co-appearance of properties that can lead to explanatory\ntheories. The second key parameter for a polythetic approach is the\nthreshold number. Alston does not stipulate the number of\ncharacteristics a member of the class has to have, saying simply,\n\u201cWhen enough of these characteristics are present to a\nsufficient degree, we have a religion\u201d (1967: 142). Needham\n(1975) discusses the sensible idea that each member has a\nmajority of the properties, but this is not a requirement of\npolythetic approaches. The critics are right that as one increases the\nsize of the properties set and decreases the threshold number, the\nresulting category becomes more and more diffuse. This can produce a\nclass that is so sprawling that it is difficult to use for empirical\nstudy.\n\nScholars of religion who have used a polythetic approach have\ntypically worked with a \u201cbounded\u201d approach (that is, with\na properties set that is fixed), but this is not actually the view for\nwhich Wittgenstein himself argues. Wittgenstein\u2019s goal is to\ndraw attention to the fact that the actual use of concepts is\ntypically not bound: \u201cthe extension of the concept is\nnot closed by a frontier\u201d (Wittgenstein 1953, \u00a767). We can\ncall this an \u201copen\u201d polythetic approach. To grasp the open\napproach, consider a group of people who have a concept they apply to\na certain range of instances. In time, a member of the group\nencounters something new that resembles the other instances enough in\nher eyes that she applies the concept to it. When the linguistic\ncommunity adopts this novel application, the extension of the concept\ngrows. If their use of the concept is \u201copen\u201d, however,\nthen, as the group adds a new member to the category named by a\nconcept, properties of that new member that had not been part of the\nearlier uses can be added to the properties set and thereby increase\nthe range of legitimate applications of the concept in the future. We\nmight say that a bounded polythetic approach produces concepts that\nare fuzzy, and an open polythetic approach produces concepts that are\nfuzzy and evolving. Timothy Williamson calls this \u201cthe\ndynamic quality of family resemblance concepts\u201d (1994: 86). One\ncould symbolize the shift of properties over time this way:\n\n\n\nReligion 1:\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE \n\nReligion 2:\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF \n\nReligion 3:\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG \n\nReligion 4:\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH \n\nReligion 5:\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI \n\nReligion 6:\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ \n\n\u2026  \n\n\nWittgenstein famously illustrated this open polythetic approach with\nthe concept game, and he also applied it to the concepts of\nlanguage and number (Wittgenstein 1953,\n\u00a767). If we substitute our concept as Wittgenstein\u2019s\nexample, however, his treatment fits religion just as\nwell:\n\n\nWhy do we call something a \u201creligion\u201d? Well, perhaps\nbecause it has a direct relationship with several things that have\nhitherto been called religion; and this can be said to give an\nindirect relationship to other things we call the same\nname. (Wittgenstein 1953, \u00a767)\n\n\nGiven an open polythetic approach, a concept evolves in the light of\nthe precedents that speakers recognize, although, over time, what\npeople come to label with the concept can become very different from\nthe original use.\n\nIn the academic study of religions, discussions of monothetic and\npolythetic approaches have primarily been in service of developing a\ndefinition of the\n term.[13]\n How can alternate definitions of religion be assessed? If\none were to offer a lexical definition (that is, a description of what\nthe term means in common usage, as with a dictionary definition), then\nthe definition one offers could be shown to be wrong. In common usage,\nfor example, Buddhism typically is considered a religion and\ncapitalism typically is not. On this point, some believe erroneously\nthat one can correct a definition by pointing to some fact about the\nreferents of the term. One sees this assumption, for example, in those\nwho argue that the western discovery of Buddhism shows that theistic\ndefinitions of religion are wrong (e.g., Southwold 1978:\n367). One can correct a real or lexical definition in this way, but\nnot a stipulative definition, that is, a description of the meaning\nthat one assigns to the term. When one offers a stipulative\ndefinition, that definition cannot be wrong. Stipulative definitions\nare assessed not by whether they are true or false but rather by their\nusefulness, and that assessment will be purpose-relative (cf. Berger\n1967: 175). De Muckadell (2014) rejects stipulative definitions of\nreligion for this reason, arguing that one cannot critique\nthem and that they force scholars simply to \u201caccept whatever\ndefinition is offered\u201d. She gives the example of a problematic\nstipulative definition of religion as \u201cice-skating\nwhile singing\u201d which, she argues, can only be rejected by using\na real definition of religion that shows the ice-skating\ndefinition to be false. However, even without knowing the real essence\nof religion, one can critique a stipulative definition, either for\nbeing less adequate or appropriate for a particular purpose (such as\nstudying forms of life across cultures) or, as with the ice-skating\nexample, for being so far from a lexical definition that it is\nadequate or appropriate for almost no purpose.\n\nPolythetic definitions are increasingly popular today as people seek\nto avoid the claim that an evolving social category has an ahistorical\n essence.[14]\n However, the difference between these two approaches is not that\nmonothetic definitions fasten on a single property whereas polythetic\ndefinitions recognize more. Monothetic definitions can be\nmultifactorial, as we have seen, and they can recognize just as many\nproperties that are \u201ccommon\u201d or even \u201ctypical\u201d\nof religions, without being essential. The difference is also not that\nthe monothetic identification of the essence of religion\nreflects an ethnocentrism that polythetic approaches avoid. The\npolythetic identification of a prototypical religion is equally\nethnocentric. The difference between them, rather, is that a\nmonothetic definition sorts instances with a Yes/No mechanism and is\ntherefore digital, and a polythetic definition produces gradations and\nis therefore analog. It follows that a monothetic definition treats a\nset of instances that all possess the one defining property as\nequally religion, whereas a polythetic definition produces a\ngray area for instances that are more prototypical or less so. This\nmakes a monothetic definition superior for cases (for example, legal\ncases) in which one seeks a Yes/No answer. Even if an open polythetic\napproach accurately describes how a concept operates, therefore, one\nmight, for purposes of focus or clarity, prefer to work with a closed\npolythetic account that limits the properties set, or even with a\nmonothetic approach that limits the properties set to one. That is,\none might judge that it is valuable to treat the concept\nreligion as structurally fuzzy or temporally fluid, but\nnevertheless place boundaries on the forms of life one will\ncompare.\n\nThis strategy gives rise to a third kind of polythetic approach, one\nthat stipulates that one property (or one set of properties) is\nrequired. Call this an \u201canchored\u201d polythetic definition.\nConsistently treating concepts as tools, Wittgenstein suggests this\n\u201canchored\u201d idea when he writes that when we look at the\nhistory of a concept,\n\n\nwhat we see is something constantly fluctuating \u2026 [but we might\nnevertheless] set over against this fluctuation something more fixed,\njust as one paints a stationary picture of the constantly altering\nface of the landscape. (1974: 77)\n\n\nGiven a stipulated \u201canchor\u201d, a concept will then possess a\nnecessary property, and this property reintroduces essentialism. Such\na definition nevertheless still reflects a polythetic approach because\nthe presence of the required property is not sufficient to make\nsomething a religion. To illustrate this strategy, one might stipulate\nthat the only forms of life one will consider a religion will\ninclude\n\n(A)\na belief in superempirical beings or powers\n\n\n(thereby excluding nationalism and capitalism, for example), but the\npresence of this property does not suffice to count this form of life\nas a religion. Consider the properties set introduced above that also\nincludes\n\n(B)\nethical norms,\n(C)\nworship rituals,\n(D)\nparticipation believed to bestow benefits on participants,\nand\n(E)\nthose who participate in this form of life see themselves as a\ndistinct community.\n\n\nIf the threshold number is still three, then to be a religion, a form\nof life would have to have three of these properties, one of which\nmust be\n (A).\n An anchored definition of religion like this would have the benefits\nof the other polythetic definitions. For example, it would not produce\na clear line between religion and nonreligion but would instead\narticulate gradations between different forms of life (or between\nversions of one form of life at different times) that are less or more\nprototypically religious. However, given its anchor, it would produce\na more focused range of\n cases.[15]\n In this way, the use of an anchor might both reflect the contemporary\ncosmological view of the concept religion and also address\nthe criticism that polythetic approaches make a concept too vague.\n",
