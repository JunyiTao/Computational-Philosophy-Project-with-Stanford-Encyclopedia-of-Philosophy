    "preamble": "\n\nEconomic discourse of the early modern period offers an analysis of\nspecific core phenomena: property, money, commerce, trade, public\nfinance, population growth, and economic development, as well as\ninvestigations into economic inequality and distributive justice. Many\nof the leading early modern philosophers, from Nicholas Copernicus to\nAdam Smith, made significant contributions to economics. This list\nincludes Jean Bodin, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, George Berkeley,\nMontesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, David Hume, \u00c9tienne Bonnot\nde Condillac, and Jeremy Bentham. Other philosophers of renown\naddressed the principles of property and commercial obligations,\nnotably Hugo Grotius, Samuel Pufendorf, Thomas Paine, Immanuel Kant,\nCondorcet, and Sophie de Grouchy. If economics is construed more\nbroadly as reflections on the moral dimensions of material betterment,\nthen the list much expands, to include, for example, Bernard\nMandeville, Frances Hutcheson, Voltaire, Thomas Reid, and Antonio\nGenovesi. If one expands the ambit of economics to include the complex\ninterplay between reason and the passions as directed at the pursuit\nof happiness, then countless men and women of letters in the early\nmodern period contributed to this discourse.\n\nThere were at least a dozen schools of economic thought in the early\nmodern period. Impressively, by the close of the eighteenth century,\nmany of the core principles and laws on money, markets, and trade had\nbeen articulated, and many of the methods of economics\u2014model\nbuilding, time series analysis, statistical estimation, game theory\nand decision theory\u2014were already extant. In sum, the\n\u201cscience of commerce\u201d as economics was mostly known at the\ntime, was a mature inquiry and, as held true of the natural sciences\nin the early modern period, drew substantially on its philosophical\nroots.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Schools of Economic Thought\n\nAdam Smith\u2019s An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the\nWealth of Nations (1776) is without question the single most\ninfluential tome, both for the early modern period and for the entire\nhistory of economics. Smith\u2019s analysis not only unpacked the\ncore features of money and markets, but also provided a dynamic\nanalysis of the \u201cprogress of opulence\u201d, sweeping across\nthe globe and reaching back to ancient times (see Rothschild & Sen\n2006). He covered the entire range of economics, from price theory to\npublic finance. Significantly\u2014and this may prove his greatest\ncontribution\u2014his first and only other book, The Theory of\nMoral Sentiments (1759), developed a moral psychology that served\nas the foundation for his economics and, arguably, for economics to\nthe present insofar as it still commits to the self-interest axiom\n(see Davis 2003; Schliesser 2017; Fleischacker 2013 [2020]).\nSmith\u2019s first book motivated the universal sympathetic regard\nthat binds us to one another, even to strangers, and it established a\nrestless desire for approbation and hence for wealth as the driving\nforce of human betterment. Finally, his essays on the history of\nscience served to elevate the epistemic standing of economics, and by\nthe first half of the nineteenth century the science of political\neconomy, as it came to be known, was widely esteemed (see Redman\n1997).\n\nSmith remains nonpareil, not only because of the breadth and depth of\nhis work, but also because he provided one of the most penetrating\nanalyses of human behavior to explain our economic condition. If\nHobbes offered a political solution to conflict and penury, Smith\ngrasped a century later that economic forces, the accumulation of\nwealth and the ever-expanding global trade, overrode the power of the\nmost ambitious of sovereigns. Recognition of the immense power of\nmarkets, both local and international, commenced in the seventeenth\ncentury, as a number of prominent twentieth-century economists came to\nrecognize. John Maynard Keynes paid tribute to the English\nMercantilists, John Locke, and William Petty; Friedrich Hayek honored\nthe insights of Bernard Mandeville and Richard Cantillon; Paul\nSamuelson admired Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay; and Milton Friedman praised\nJohn Law. All four\u2014Keynes, Hayek, Samuelson, and\nFriedman\u2014admired and wrote about David Hume\u2019s economics\n(see Schabas & Wennerlind 2020: Ch. 7).\n\nSmith owed a sizable debt to his immediate predecessors, above all to\nhis close friend Hume with whom he exchanged ideas for over\ntwenty-five years (see Harris 2015). There is a grain of truth to\nJoseph Schumpeter\u2019s harsh judgment that\n\n\nthe Wealth of Nations does not contain a single\nanalytic idea, principle, or method that was entirely new in\n1776. (Schumpeter 1954: 184)\n\n\nThis, however, is testament to the theoretical maturity of economics\nby the second half of the eighteenth century. The most robust verities\nof economics, even to this day, are to be found in the pre-Smithian\nliterature (see Hutchison 1988). The core elements of the theory of\nprices had been broached, its grounding in use-value and\nexchange-value, the appeal to the costs of labor and the imperative of\ncost-recovery, as well as the laws of supply and demand in various\nguises, including the concept of the price-elasticity of demand.\nPre-Smithian economists are renowned for contributions to monetary\ntheory, stipulating the form and function of money, the principles of\nbimetallism, debasement and devaluation, the quantity theory of money,\nthe specie-flow mechanism and the multiplier (see Murphy 2009; Arnon\n2010). Gresham\u2019s law, devised circa 1560, was extended from\ndomestic currencies to foreign exchange markets. Financial markets\nbecame increasingly sophisticated, with a wide array of equities,\nbonds, and discounted banknotes in circulation. The state issued\npublic debt in the form of bonds and Exchequer notes, and amassed\nsignificant funds through lotteries and annuities (see Neal 1990). In\nthe stock markets of Hamburg (1558), Amsterdam (1602), and London\n(1698), one could find short selling (windhandel),\nbond-equity swaps, and futures (see De Marchi & Harrison 1994). In\n1747, \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet is reputed to have devised and\nprofited from contracting a percentage of future tax revenues, a novel\ninstrument akin to a modern derivative (Bodanis 2006:\n217\u2013218).\n\nEconomists before Smith, such as Cantillon, Hume, James Steuart, and\nAnne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, discerned some of the key arguments for\nthe gains from trade and the dynamics of economic growth that stemmed\nfrom the division of labor, population growth, economies of scale and,\nabove all, capital accumulation (see Murphy 2009). Because of the\ngrowth of markets and factor mobility, eighteenth-century economists\nrecognized the regional manifestation of a uniform wage and profit\nrate, and thus made insights not only about the inverse relationship\nbetween profits and wages but also about the tendency of the profit\nrate to decline over time. Above all, they did what is essential to\nmost if not all philosophical thought\u2014drive a wedge between\nappearance and reality\u2014distinguishing prices from underlying\nvalues, and the nominal or money wage from the real wage, its\npurchasing power. Petty, Hume, and Smith firmly entrenched the central\ndistinction of the nominal and the real in economic discourse while\nalso grappling with efforts to measure inflation.\n\nAs a field of inquiry, economics was prodigious during the early\nmodern period. From the mid-sixteenth to the late eighteenth century,\nthe catalogue of French and English publications on economics exceeded\nfive thousand entries (see Massie 1760; Th\u00e9r\u00e9 1998;\nHoppit 2006). These took the form of books, short tracts, essays,\npamphlets, and dictionaries, as well as entries in periodicals such as\nthe Gentleman\u2019s Magazine or\n\u00c9ph\u00e9m\u00e9rides du citoyen.\n\nThere were at least a dozen distinct schools of economic thought in\nearly modern Europe (see Hutchison 1988). By far the largest and most\nlong-lived were the Cameralists, and their voluminous output is not\nincluded in the figure of five thousand given above. Cameralists were\nto be found across the Germanic, Scandinavian, and Italian\nprincipalities or republics for much of the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies. Kameralwissenschaft, or the economics of the\nchamber, was primarily a set of courses for young men as preparation\nfor government positions. They also studied philosophy, the\nmetaphysics of Christian Wolff for example, as well as botany,\nchemistry and metallurgy (see Tribe 1978; Wakefield 2009). Some of the\nleading Cameralists, notably Johann Joachim Becher, Joseph von\nSonnenfels, and Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi, advanced distinct\ndoctrines pertaining to autarky or public finance, vestiges of which\nendured in twentieth-century Fascism. Justi\u2019s last book,\nSystem des Finanzwesens (1766), synthesized much of the\nextant knowledge of Cameralism, specifically on fiscal policy. As a\ngroup, they concentrated on resource extraction\u2014mining and\nlogging\u2014as the means to enrichment and self-sufficiency, but\nthere were also schemes, particularly by the Swedish botanist and\nCameralist, Carl Linnaeus, to domesticate non-native plants as a means\nto reduce trade dependencies (see Koerner 1999).\n\nInnumerable writings on money, trade and commerce were posthumously\ngrouped by Adam Smith under the rubric of the \u201cMercantile\nSystem\u201d, or what eventually came to be known as Mercantilism.\nMany of the texts were polemical and self-serving, and endorsed Crown\nrights and monopolistic trade. Mercantilist writings sprang up across\nwestern Europe, particularly in seventeenth-century Sweden, Holland,\nand England (see Magnusson 1994; Stern & Wennerlind 2014). Among\nthese were important works by Gerard de Malynes (1622) and Edward\nMisselden (1623), each of whom made efforts to discover the underlying\nfactors for the economic depression of the 1620s (see Appleby 1978).\nThe two most influential English mercantilists, Thomas Mun (1664) and\nJohn Cary (1695) theorized about the gains from trade and its benefits\nfor national wealth and well-being, and were by no means crude\nbullionists (see Reinert 2011).\n\nOther schools were more localized and less enduring than the\nCameralists or Mercantilists. One of the first is the Salamanca school\nof mid-sixteenth-century Spain that included Luis de Molina,\nMart\u00edn de Azpilcueta, and Francisco Su\u00e1rez (see\nGrice-Hutchinson 1978). Another school drew inspiration from the\nnatural law theories of Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf, who had\naddressed the principles governing contractual obligations in general,\nand the complexities of property rights in particular (see Skinner\n1999). Johan De Wit and Christiaan Huygens of the Dutch Golden age\nrecorded important insights into commercial mathematics (see Daston\n1988; Sylla 2003). The Political Arithmeticians of seventeenth-century\nEngland and Ireland, notably William Petty, Edmund Halley, and John\nGraunt, devised ingenious methods for measuring population, the money\nsupply, and the movement of core prices (see Rusnock 1999). The\nStadialists of eighteenth-century Scotland, namely Lord Kames, Adam\nFerguson, and John Millar, offered a theory of economic development\nbased on four stages, hunting and gathering, shepherding, cultivation,\nand commerce and trade that was partly adopted by Hume and Smith (see\nWolloch 2011).\n\nEarly modern France spawned a number of distinct groups, each one\nadhering to the dictates of a single leader, namely the Colbertistes\n(Jean-Baptiste Colbert), the Gournay Circle\n(Jacques-Claude-Marie-Vincent de Gournay), and most famously, the\nPhysiocrats, who were also known as \u201cles\n\u00e9conomistes\u201d devoted to their founder Fran\u00e7ois\nQuesnay, court physician at Versailles (see Meek 1962; Larr\u00e8re\n1992; Faccarello 1989 [1999]). In the Italian cities, Milan and\nNaples, Enlightenment circles were renowned for espousing the ideals\nof pubblica felicit\u00e0 (public happiness) and\neconomia civile (civil economy). Some of the leading thinkers\nwere Antonio Genovesi, Cesare Beccaria, Pietro Verri, and Ferdinando\nGaliani (see Robertson 2005; Reinert 2018). Portugal housed an active\ngroup of economic thinkers, notably Ant\u00f3nio de Vasconcelos\nNogueira and Isaac da Pinto (Cardoso 1990). In colonial America and\nits early days as the republic of the United States of America,\nBenjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, Alexander Hamilton, and James\nMadison, among others, devised a distinct set of principles on money,\nbanking, capital markets, and property rights that were directly\nindebted to the teachings of Locke, Montesquieu, Hume, and Smith (see\nPocock 1985).\n\nFrom the standpoint of present mainstream economics, the legacy of the\nBritish utilitarians was by far the deepest and longest, starting with\nFrancis Bacon, Shaftesbury (Anthony Ashley Cooper), and Francis\nHutcheson, who coined the phrase \u201cthe greatest happiness for the\ngreatest number\u201d (1725 [1726: \u00a73.8]), a governing principle\nfor both Hume and Smith in their economic inquiries (see Gill 2006;\nDriver 2009 [2014]). Hume\u2019s quartet of \u201chappiness\nessays\u201d (1742 but collected in 1758), and Smith\u2019s two\nbooks (1759, 1776) are replete with insights on the ethical dimensions\nof the pursuit of wealth. Each one recognized that there were many\nimpediments to happiness, that humans are prone to self-deception, to\noverestimate their luck and to underestimate the adversities that life\nholds. They each positioned non-pecuniary goods, equanimity and\nfriendship, as more valuable than material wealth, and issued numerous\ninsights on the various paths one might take with one\u2019s life.\nWhile the debate about the degree to which either Hume or Smith\nadhered more to virtue ethics than to utilitarianism may never be\nresolved, when it comes to their respective economic analyses, their\nconsequentialist observations about untoward ambition or the value of\nforesight fits a utilitarian sensibility (see Sakamoto 2016: Schabas\n2015).\n\nThe early utilitarians, grounded in British empiricism, laid the\nfoundation for both the classical school of political economy and for\nneoclassical economics that commenced with the Marginal Revolution of\nthe 1870s. Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill and Henry Sidgwick made\nmajor contributions to the moral doctrine of utilitarianism and to\npolitical economy. It is important to distinguish the moral doctrine\nof utilitarianism from the utility theory of value that unpacks the\nformation of prices. Utilitarianism provided a framing for economic\nthought from the seventeenth century, whereas the utility theory of\nvalue, while broached multiple times in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, only replaced the labor theory of value in the 1870s.\n\nInterestingly, the majority of the leading contributors to nineteenth\neconomics lived in Britain. This list features David Ricardo, John\nStuart Mill, Alfred Marshall\u2014even Karl Marx, notwithstanding\nJean-Baptiste Say, L\u00e9on Walras, or the Austrians. The\nprevalence of economic discourse in Britain might partly reflect its\nhegemonic standing in global trade, but a more significant factor\nmight be its enlightened culture that fostered freedoms of the press,\nliberal mores, and religious toleration (see Winch 1996).\n\nEighteenth-century economic discourse was more evenly spread across\nthe Continent, but the empiricist school in Britain left the most\nenduring imprint. Locke, Hume and Smith made important contributions\nto economics, whereas scholars have yet to locate significant economic\ninsights in the work of the leading rationalists, Descartes, Spinoza,\nor Leibniz, although Leibniz also wrote extensively on politics. One\ndiscernible pattern is that the leading anglophone contributors to\neighteenth-century economics were, for the most part, not\nEnglish-born, but Dutch, Scottish or Irish; nor were they particularly\ndevout. Locke is the notable exception on both counts. It is important\nto point out that Mandeville (Dutch), Cantillon (Irish-French), and\nthe Scots Law, Hume, and Smith, were inclined to study and promote\ncommerce and trade as the progressive face of a more secular world. If\nmuch of modern economic thinking builds upon moral philosophy, it is\nand was, with a few exceptions, grounded in non-sacred sources.\n\nThis pattern of thinkers on the periphery of the religious status quo\nis also manifest in the nineteenth century, with Say, Ricardo, and the\nMills, p\u00e8re et fils. To engage in the study of economics\ndemands a willingness to overcome the Biblical restrictions on\ncommercial activities. As Voltaire observed, praising the degree of\nreligious diversity in the London stock market,\n\n\nwhere there is not liberty of conscience, there is seldom liberty of\ntrade, the same tyranny encroaching upon commerce as upon Religion.\n(Voltaire [1952: 43])\n\n\nThe fact that individual liberties and religious toleration were more\nprevalent in Britain might provide a more plausible explanation as to\nwhy mainstream economic thought was most cultivated in the English\nlanguage over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\n(see Mokyr 2009). This is in marked contrast to the natural sciences,\nwhich were most concentrated in France in the eighteenth century and\nin Germany in the nineteenth century.\n\nMany contributors to economics were actively engaged in scientific and\nphilosophical societies. The members of the Hartlib Circle of\nmid-seventeenth century England conjoined natural science with\neconomic objectives, not least alchemical pursuits as a solution to\nthe dire shortage of coins (see Wennerlind 2014). Its best known\nmember, the Irish philosopher William Petty, was a leading contributor\nto monetary theory and demography, as well as a founding member of the\nRoyal Society. His economic writings fill two large volumes and he\nbroached the concepts of the transactions level and the velocity of\nmoney, two key variables that cemented the core principle of the\nquantity theory of money. Two of the most renowned philosophers of the\nperiod, Locke and Isaac Newton, were actively engaged in debates over\nthe value of the currency, specifically when Newton served as Warden\nand then Master of the Mint (see Westfall 1981). Hume and Smith were\nmembers of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society (Hume was co-secretary)\nand were close friends of the leading contributors to mainstream\nscience, William Cullen, Joseph Black, and James Hutton in Scotland,\nas well as, in Hume\u2019s case, the French proto-evolutionist Comte\nde Buffon and, in Smith\u2019s case, the French botanist Charles\nBonnet. Smith\u2019s essays on the history of astronomy and of\nphysics, first sketched in the 1750s but updated and revised for the\nrest of his life, display a sophisticated command of science and the\nhistory and philosophy of science. His stance was one of fallibilism\nand instrumentalism, and he broached the possibility that the\nNewtonian system, while ascendant, would one day be superseded (see\nSchliesser 2017).\n\nIn France, the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences offered prizes for\ncontributions to economics, and the multi-volume\nEncyclop\u00e9die (1751\u20131780) produced by Denis\nDiderot and Jean le Rond d\u2019Alembert distinctly positioned\neconomics on the tree of knowledge, as one of the three branches of\nthe moral sciences (politics and natural jurisprudence were the other\ntwo). It contained numerous entries on mining, metallurgy and\ntextiles, including one that illustrated the production of metal pins\nthat most likely inspired Smith for his analysis of the division of\nlabor (Ross 1995, 273-274). There were important entries by Rousseau,\nentitled \u201c\u00e9conomie ou \u0153conomie\u201d (1755), by\nQuesnay, entitled \u201cfermiers\u201d (1756) and\n\u201cgrains\u201d (1757), and by Turgot, entitled\n\u201cfoire\u201d (1756). In sum, eighteenth-century economics was\nconjoined with natural philosophy, both theoretical and applied. It is\nnot by accident that Turgot, best known as an economist and as\nContr\u00f4leur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des finances (1774-1776),\ndevised one of the most critical breakthroughs for the Chemical\nRevolution. His concepts of expansibilit\u00e9 and\nvaporization recognized that each substance, when heated,\nunderwent state changes from solid, to liquid, to gas. A number of the\nleading contributors to eighteenth-century science, notably Carl\nLinnaeus, Leonhard Euler and Antoine Lavoisier, also wrote about\neconomics.\n2. Temporal Boundaries\n\nWhen writing the history of a segment of the past there is always a\ndegree of arbitrariness in demarcating its temporal boundary. Early\nmodern philosophy spans the early sixteenth century to the late\neighteenth century, but where to draw the precise boundaries will\nforever garner debate. In the history of economics, there is little\nquestion that Adam Smith constitutes the founding authority on the\nsubject. A few general treatises appeared before Adam Smith\u2019s,\nstarting with Antoine de Montchr\u00e9tien\u2019s\nTraict\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9conomie politique (1615),\nPierre de Boisguilbert, Dissertation de la nature des\nrichesses (1707) and culminating with Turgot\u2019s\nR\u00e9flexions sur la formation et la distribution des\nrichessess (1766), James Steuart\u2019s Principles of\nPolitical \u0152conomy (1767), and Condillac\u2019s Le\nCommerce et le gouvernement consid\u00e9r\u00e9s relativement\nl\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019autre (1776). Nevertheless, Adam\nSmith\u2019s Wealth of Nations (1776) was the definitive\nwork of the period, although it took about two decades to reach that\nstature, and serve as the founding text for the classical school of\npolitical economy of the nineteenth century.\n\nAs Michel Foucault discerned in Les mots et les choses\n(The Order of Things, 1966 [1970]), there was a significant\ntransformation in economic discourse circa 1800, but not for the\nreasons he gave. It was not that the concept of wealth was merely\nrepresented before 1800, and then gained materiality. What\ndistinguishes early modern economics from the classical period that\ntook hold in the early nineteenth century was that the latter\norganized their analysis around \u201cthe economy\u201d. Prior to\nthat, the various core phenomena were either treated separately or, if\nbundled together, were for the most part treated as part of the\nnatural order (see Schabas 2005).\n\nIt is important to recognize that \u201cthe economy\u201d is a\ntheoretical construct, an emergent order that sits upon patterns of\nhuman activity directed at production, distribution, and consumption.\nAs a social kind, recognition of \u201cthe economy\u201d took hold\nwith Ricardo (1817) and John Stuart Mill (1848), among others (see\nTribe 1981). This shift in part reflected the great economic\ntransformation of the time, what has come to be known as the\nIndustrial Revolution. Smith and his predecessors were still under the\ngrip of a pre-industrial world, one of mercantile and agrarian\ncapitalism, with only fleeting acknowledgments of the industrial\ntake-off that had commenced by the 1760s.\n\nFinally, the adjective \u201cpolitical\u201d became paramount in the\nnineteenth century, but was seldom used in the early modern period.\nThe primary name for economics in the eighteenth century was the\n\u201cscience of commerce\u201d, as is evident in the titles of a\nnumber of leading texts at the time, for example by Forbonnais,\nCantillon, Tucker, and Condillac. Moreover, the primary focus was on\npublic debt, and appeals to significant political reforms were\nperipheral rather than central. As Hume observed in 1741, \u201ctrade\nwas never esteemed an affair of state till the last century\u201d\n(\u201cOf Civil Liberty\u201d, [1987: 88])\u2014Niccol\u00f2\nMachiavelli made no mention of trade; moreover, it might prove too\nchallenging to arrive at \u201cgeneral truths in politics\u201d\n(ibid. [1987: 87\u201388]). When Smith took up the \u201cscience of\npolitical economy\u201d in Book Four of the Wealth of\nNations, he limited it to the policies of the legislator and\npublic finance. Notwithstanding attention to the political\nrestrictions on trade and commerce, the leading economists of the\nlatter half of the eighteenth century, namely Hume, Quesnay, Turgot,\nand Smith, were inclined to downplay the influence of politics, and\nwere conservative when it came to property rights. It was an age\ndominated by Montesquieu in France, and Edmund Burke in Britain, and\nthe revolutions of 1776 and 1789 were bourgeois rather than socialist\n(see Pocock 1985; Sonenscher 2007).\n\nIn this respect as well, political economy of the nineteenth century\nwas significantly different in tenor; it put center-stage the plight\nof the poor, the expansion of suffrage to working men, and their\nentitlement to form trade unions. Socialist economic thought only\nemerged in the beginning of the nineteenth century, particularly in\nFrance. There were antecedents, such as the English Levellers Gerrard\nWinstanley and John Lilburne, and the Dutch reformers Johan De Witt\nand Pieter de la Court, but they were not important contributors to\neconomic discourse. To a significant degree, Smith served as the\ninflection point, with his famous statement that \u201cno society can\nsurely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the\nmembers are poor and miserable\u201d, or that merchants \u201chave\nan interest to deceive and even to oppress the public\u201d (Smith\n1776 [1976: 96, 267]). British and French economic thought, with some\nexceptions, leaned primarily toward socialism throughout the\nnineteenth century. Ricardo exposed the parasitical standing of the\nlandowning class, and spawned a radical following that included both\nJames and John Stuart Mill, as well as a group known as the Ricardian\nsocialists. In fact, many of the early neoclassical economists, for\nexample William Stanley Jevons, Alfred Marshall, and L\u00e9on\nWalras, were democratic socialists of one stripe or another. It is not\na challenge to plaster a very different and far more conservative\ntenor to mainstream economics of the twentieth century, whether one\nlooks to Vilfredo Pareto, Irving Fisher, Schumpeter, Hayek or\nFriedman. Attending to the political hue of economic discourse serves\nall the more to distinguish the early modern period from the classical\nschool of political economy of the nineteenth century or the\nneoclassical school that persists to the present.\n\nWhile there is no single definition of economics, most of the\ndiscourse of the early modern period centered upon a set of phenomena\nsuch as prices, trade, taxes, money and banking. In the nineteenth\ncentury, most texts foregrounded the laws that govern production and\ndistribution and, starting in the 1870s, exchange and consumption. In\nthe twentieth century, the best known definition is the one offered by\nLionel Robbins in 1932:\n\n\nEconomics is the science which studies human behaviour as a\nrelationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative\nuses. (Robbins 1932: 15)\n\n\nConsumers maximize utility (preferences) and firms maximize profits\n(expected returns), and this seeps into virtually every facet of life.\nGiven some limiting assumptions, modern welfare theory can prove that\nan economy in general equilibrium attains Pareto optimality, that it\nis the most efficient and the most just.\n3. Pre-Modern Economic Thought\n\nAs with many sciences, Aristotle laid much of the groundwork for\neconomic thought, and his legacy, with the medieval scholastics, with\nthe early modern philosophers and last but not least with Karl Marx,\nwas profound and far-reaching (see Meikle 1995). Aristotle\u2019s\nunit of analysis was the oikos, or household, from which the\nword economy is derived, but he also issued important insights on\nmoney and prices, as well as property and slavery. Above all, he\nargued that commercial pursuits were, for the most part, unethical,\nbecause they distorted means and ends. He thus drove a wedge between\nmaterial betterment and the pursuit of virtue. Economic pursuits must\nalways be subsumed to the good life, or sustained happiness\n(eudaimonia). Usury was particularly problematic because it\nviolated the natural order, obtaining a yield from an object, money,\nthat was inanimate (Aristotle Politics 1258b).\n\nAristotle asked one of the most fundamental questions of economics:\nWhat is a price? The simple answer is a ratio of two goods, one of\nwhich might be the established currency, but he maintained that it\nmade no difference; a price in barter is the same as a money price.\nHowever, he qualified this claim with the recognition of the evolution\nof money over time and the fact that many mistake it as an end in\nitself rather than simply a means to facilitate barter. More\nremarkably, Aristotle grasped that a price masks the fact that no two\ncommodities are fully commensurable. Exchange of goods or services, he\nnoted, is grounded in fulfilling specific human needs, and no two of\nthose are ever the same.\n\n\nAlthough [two] things so different cannot become commensurate in\nreality, they can become commensurate enough in relation to our needs\n\u2026 Currency, then by making things commensurate as a measure\ndoes, equalizes them. (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics,\n1131b16-20)\n\n\nHe went further on this path and asserted what is one of the most\nenduring propositions in economics, namely that \u201ceverything must\nhave a price\u201d. (ibid.)\n\nAristotle identified the three functional properties of money that\nremain canonical: money serves as a unit of account (a measure), a\nmedium of exchange (replacing barter), and a store of value (stockpile\nof wealth). Furthermore, he noted that the denomination is purely\nconventional and that legal authorities might alter this at whim.\nMoney was but a yardstick to measure the exchange-value of goods but\nunlike those goods, lacked a use-value as the fable of Midas proved\nall too well. He also asserted that it made no difference what\nsubstance is used for money, but then went on to assert that the\nfetish for gold and silver had made metallic coins unique in human\nsociety. Moreover, precious metals offered certain advantages: they\nare durable, divisible, transportable, and easily stamped with the\nvalue of the coin. Finally, his analysis of monopolistic pricing\ndisplays a firm grasp of the principles of supply and demand.\n\nAquinas, Jean Buridan, and Nicole Oresme, among others of the late\nmedieval period, assimilated Aristotelian economic thought to Biblical\nteachings and, by and large, cast commercial activities in a negative\nlight (Jones 1989; Langholm 1998). To buy low and sell high was to\nengage in deception and hence to violate the Golden Rule. To practice\nusury contravened the Biblical dictum, to \u201clend, expecting\nnothing in return\u201d (Luke 6:35). The late medieval philosophers\ndug more deeply into the evolving legal practices of their time,\ninsofar as wholesale grain merchants, partnerships, and debasements\nhad become increasingly commonplace. Aquinas and Buridan each\naccepted, albeit with qualifications, that money is but a unit of\nmeasure set by men, and thus decreed that the crown might alter the\ndenomination to serve the common good (Kaye 1998; Hirschfeld 2018).\nOresme\u2019s Treatise on Money (1358) went further, acknowledging\nthe problematic shortage of specie and thereby promoting the use of\ncopper or \u201cblack money\u201d, since the coins had turned this\ncolor from overuse. He positioned the currency within the commercial\nsphere and thus broke all the more from the Christian view that the\nestablished coins emanated from God via divine rule, and were thus the\nsole property of the prince (Lapidus 1997).\n\nIn the case of commercial transactions, particularly of necessities,\nthe late scholastics recognized legitimate charges for mercantile\nservices of transportation, storage, and risk-taking, but condemned\nthe practices of price gouging and other types of market\nmanipulations, particularly the forestalling, regrating and engrossing\nof grain supplies. As for singular purchases of land or a luxury item,\nAquinas unpacked in considerable detail the question of whether or not\nit was ethical to sell a good for more than it is worth.\nNotwithstanding customary prices, he recognized numerous circumstances\nwhere this might prove not only legal but also ethical. While berating\nthe Roman maxim of caveat emptor, he endorsed the prevailing\nprinciple of laesio enormis which stipulated that the\ncontracted price could fall within a fifty percent range (plus or\nminus) of the customary price. The doctrine of the \u201cjust\nprice\u201d, one that covered costs but was also sensitive to local\nconditions of demand, was further developed in this period and is\nstill at the core of commercial law. Aquinas also reviewed four\ndifferent contexts that would permit the charging of interest. One\narticulated the concept of an opportunity cost, and another appealed\nto the arrangement of capital transfer known as a partnership still\nhonored today by Islamic authorities. Increasingly, commercial loans\nsaw the principal as a form of capital that had legitimate and\nalternative yields. In sum, the late scholastics offer many insights\non commerce and trade, the status of the Crown in managing legal\ntender, and the inherent tensions between commerce and virtue.\n4. Ethics of Commerce and Trade\n\nAs Albert O. Hirschman (1977) argued, philosophers in early modern\nEurope went to great lengths to position commerce, banking, and the\naccumulation of wealth in a positive light, and thus overturn the\nharsh judgments of Aristotle and Aquinas. The widespread doctrine of\ndoux commerce cast the pursuit of pecuniary interests in an\ninnocent light and tamed the other more untoward passions for\npolitical power or lust. The core idea was that the love of\ngain\u2014relishing the ever-increasing pile of coins\u2014eclipsed\ninclinations for other pleasures or more indolent pursuits. This in\nturn prompted industriousness, a virtue that had already been firmly\nestablished by Hobbes and Locke, among others. Furthermore, as Locke\nhad argued, money served to reduce the affront to God in the event\nthat plums or meat were left to rot rather than brought to market.\nThat said, the modern era was a far cry from Locke\u2019s vision of\nthe American frontier. Many merchants made vast sums from importing\nluxuries\u2014coffee, tea or tobacco\u2014and some European nations\nimposed sumptuary laws or hefty taxes to reduce this trade. Several\nphilosophers argued that the consumption of luxuries was unethical,\nJoseph Butler and Claude-Adrien Helv\u00e9tius for example (see\nBerry 1994). Mandeville and Hume were two of the first to argue that\nthe economic benefits of luxuries outweighed the potential deleterious\neffects (see Susato 2006). Hume also noted that goods that had once\nbeen luxuries, such as paper, had become not just conveniences but\neven necessities. Adam Smith condemned sumptuary laws as hypocritical,\nsince the extravagant consumption by the aristocrats who set the laws\ntended to be far more ruinous to the well-being of the state (Smith\n1776 [1976: 346]).\n\nMoney-making and material advancement also rendered human actions more\npredictable and transparent. The seventeenth-century maxim that\n\u201cinterest will not lie\u201d, first coined by Henri de Rohan,\nwas in wide circulation (Hirschman 1977: 36). The self-interest axiom\nalso began to germinate in economic discourse, enhanced by appeals to\nother virtuous traits, prudence and foresight (see Force 2003).\nSelf-interest did not eclipse other-regarding traits, however, nor\nentail selfishness. While serving their pecuniary interests, merchants\nmaintained that they also served God and Country, by increasing crown\nrevenues and by taming the open seas. Merchants also prompted the rise\nof artisanal techniques and hence the growth of towns. This in turn\nprompted more mild and moderate dispositions. As Montesquieu remarked\nin the Spirit of the Laws:\n\n\nit is an almost general rule that everywhere there are gentle mores,\nthere is commerce and that everywhere there is commerce, there are\ngentle mores. (1748: [1989: 338])\n\n\nCommerce induced civility and more feminine sentiments. As Hume\nobserved of those who\n\n\nflock into cities, \u2026 both sexes meet in an easy and sociable\nmanner; and the tempers of men, as well as their behaviour, refine\napace\u2026 it is impossible but they must feel an increase of\nhumanity, from the very habit of conversing together. (\u201cOf\nRefinement in the Arts\u201d [1987: 271])\n\n\nSmith observed in his Theory of Moral Sentiments that\n\u201chumanity is the virtue of a woman\u201d, and that\n\n\namong civilized nations, the virtues which are founded upon humanity,\nare more cultivated than those which are founded upon self-denial and\nthe command of the passions. (1759 [1976: 190, 204\u20135])\n\n\nSmith, however, also expressed the worry that the European upper crust\nsuffered from excessive \u201cflattery and falsehood\u201d, and that\nthe \u201cman of fashion\u201d lacked the more esteemed\n\u201cmasculine virtues\u201d (1759 [1976: 63]). Modern commercial\nlife, for Smith, was not unequivocally for the good.\n\nIn his overview of early modern economics, Hirschman foregrounded what\nhe called the Montesquieu-Steuart doctrine, namely that international\ntrade induced global peace. Montesquieu singled out the significance\nof the bill of exchange as a critical starting point. This was an\ninternational bank order that much expanded European trade in the\nearly modern period, and constituted an extensive network of trust\nbetween the major banking families in different countries. To trade\nover great distances requires considerable coordination and\ncooperation, if only because of the need to recognize different\ncurrencies or to contract deliveries at a later point in time. The\nbill of exchange averted the risky practice of shipping silver and\ngold from one port to another, and allowed paper representations to\ncirculate and hence the expansion of credit.\n\nHobbes had already grasped that the interdependency of nations for\nbasic goods, such as Swedish timber for English wool, might lessen\ninternational conflict, particularly if nations depended on one\nanother for necessities or conveniences. Conflict stemmed from the\ndesire for imported luxury goods; these goods tended to instill a new\ntype of cupidity that would endanger peaceful trade, or so Hobbes\nbelieved (see Sorell 2006). He thus endorsed the imposition of\nsumptuary laws. Montesquieu was of a different mind. War is always\nmore destructive and more costly than trade under peaceful terms. His\nargument pivoted on an appeal to the mutual gains from trade, and the\nensuing division of labor. Hume issued other worries. He observed that\neach war of his lifetime had lasted longer, and cost more in real\nterms, than was rational given the initial objectives (\u201cOf the\nBalance of Power\u201d [1987: 339]). Insofar as much of the funding\ncame from the excessive issuance of government bonds, the mounting\npublic debt was bound to cripple the British government. The best\nmeans to avoid state bankruptcy was to overcome protectionist policies\nand promote unrestricted global trade, thereby enriching the world and\ndiminishing military conquests.\n\nHowever myopic these theories might sound\u2014given the horrific\ntreatment of African slaves and Indigenous peoples throughout the\nearly modern period, and given the bloodbath of the twentieth century\nbetween purportedly civil trading nations\u2014it is important to\nunderscore that a widespread optimism for a more peaceful and\nprosperous world characterized early modern economic thought. Immanuel\nKant\u2019s celebrated appeal to a world of perpetual peace may be\nviewed as the capstone to this long line of thought (see Nakhimovsky\n2011). As Hirschman noted, Adam Smith was the exception, for exposing\nthe monopolistic and rapacious tendencies of European merchants and\ncolonizers. Smith deplored the European treatment of African slaves\nand Indigenous peoples, not only for the inherent injustices of their\nactions, but because this tended to inculcate deplorable traits in the\ncolonizers, such as tyranny, cowardice and inhumanity (Smith 1759\n[1976: 200\u2013211]; Rothschild 2001).\n\nAbove all, Smith reduced the pursuit of wealth to mere vanity and the\ndesire for the approbation of others. There may be a trickle-down\neffect to the lower orders, or a gradual enrichment of the globe, but\nthe inherent parasitical nature of men, particularly of\nlandlords\u2014\u201cwho love to reap where they never\nsowed\u201d\u2014and the oppressive actions of the merchants ensured\nthat our world would be permanently saddled with grave injustices and\ninequalities (Smith 1776 [1976: 67]). Smith was still a far cry from\nthe stronger despairing claims of later critics of capitalism, notably\nMarx\u2019s appeal to widespread alienation, Durkheim\u2019s caveats\nabout anomie, or Keynes\u2019s ridiculing of stock market\nfrenzies (see Hirschman 1977: Part 3). Nevertheless, there is a clear\nsense in Smith that, however entrenched our practices of commerce and\ntrade, their potential to elevate humans to a kinder and better world\nbeyond mere material gratifications is severely limited (see Griswold\n1998; Hanley 2009). Smith looms large as the voice of pessimism.\n5. Principles of Property and Contracts\n\nContracts lie at the very core of economic thought. A simple purchase\nis a type of contract, the use of money another. Property rights are\nalso grounded in the idea of a contract, at least since the early\nmodern period. Aristotle had argued in favor of private property,\nprimarily with appeals to security and superior stewardship. Aquinas\nreinforced these claims but also argued that in the case of a famine\nor siege, one might appropriate available foods to fulfil the\nChristian dictate of self-preservation. In the early modern period,\nBodin, Grotius, and Pufendorf reflected at length on the question of\nproperty rights, prompted by the breakdown of feudal land tenure and\never-expanding overseas trade. Grotius\u2019s De Mare\nLiberum (1609) addressed the possibility of unregulated naval and\nfishing rights. Hobbes (1651) and Locke (1689), with their respective\nappeals to the state of nature, motivated the formation of property\nrights and hence the government. Sovereign rule would alleviate\npenury, facilitate the spread of trade and commerce and, above all,\nfoster population growth, or so it was widely believed.\n\nPopulation growth, providing more hands as well as the demand for more\ncorn and cloth, was viewed as the primary source of economic\nprosperity for about two centuries, until the alarm bell sounded by\nThomas Robert Malthus\u2019s Essay on the Principle of\nPopulation (1798). Whereas for Hobbes, might made right, Locke\ngrounded property rights in consent and the virtue of industriousness;\nthose who enclosed and cultivated the land created a right to its\nyield that did no harm to one\u2019s neighbors (see Sreenivasan\n1995). Because children are one\u2019s property, this also\nlegitimated the transfer of accumulated wealth via inheritance. Over\ntime, inequality became salient, as some owned land while others, less\nfortunate, were compelled to enter into a wage contract to earn their\nbread and ale. Locke, however, underscored the volitional nature of\nthese arrangements, forged on equal terms and by \u201ctacit\nconsent\u201d.\n\nWhile a strong advocate of traditional property laws to insure\neconomic flourishing, Hume underscored their contingent nature,\npointing to the voluminous quantity of law books that meant\ninterpretation would never come to an end. In opposition to Locke,\nHume believed that the appeal to an ancient contract forming the\ncommonwealth was merely a myth. Ancient land rights were primarily\ngained by conquest and usurpation, and sustained by privilege, rather\nthan a reward to the sweat of one\u2019s brow. By contrast, the\nmodern commercial era that enabled the spread of capital and hence\nmoveable wealth, moved in step with the rise of representative\ngovernment, either in the form of a republic or a constitutional\nmonarchy such as his own (McArthur 2007; Harris 2015).\n\nIn his Treatise of Human Nature (Book Three) Hume unpacked\nthe essential components of a contract. He identified the implicit\nconventions in contracts and the importance of trust.\n\n\nYour corn is ripe to-day; mine will be so to-morrow. \u2019Tis\nprofitable for us both, that I shou\u2019d labour with you to-day,\nand that you shou\u2019d aid me to-morrow. (Hume 1739\u201340 [2000:\n334])\n\n\nSuch contractual arrangements might exist and spread among strangers\nas individuals came to discern their benefits. As Hume observed,\n\n\nthe freedom and extent of human commerce depend entirely on a fidelity\nwith regard to promises. (1739\u201340 [2000: 349])\n\n\nThis included the use of money, which Hume recognized symbolized a\nchain of pledges, extending backward and forward in time. Property,\nmoney, and markets were thus bundled together, as conventions that ran\nno deeper than the utility of promise-keeping and one\u2019s\nhonor.\n\nHume took up the matter of forging an honorable character in his\nEnquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (1751). Although\nthe sphere for exercising one\u2019s free will to reform one\u2019s\ncharacter was very limited, Hume adhered to the gradual evolution of\nbehavioral norms, forged by material conditions, particularly commerce\nand trade. Monkish virtues of the medieval period had given way to\ncommercial virtues of the modern period, honesty, probity and\nindustry. For Adam Smith, self-command, prudence, and courage were\nvirtues ranked more highly than others. For these reasons, those in\nthe middling ranks, merchants and bankers, were more likely to happen\nonto the road to virtue than those in the lower or upper classes. And\nbecause the nouveau riches were the ones to safeguard contractual\nsettlements, this meant that the core institutions of property and\ncommerce would, ceteris paribus, be sustained in the\ncenturies ahead. The merchant or banker, not the knight, had become\nthe paragon of honor, serving the national interests as much as\nthemselves.\n6. Philosophy of Money\n\nA cornerstone of monetary theory, and arguably the most robust and\nenduring law in economics, is the quantity theory of money that\ncommits to a causal and positive function between the price level and\nthe money supply, treating the latter as the independent variable,\nthat is, \\(P = f(M^s)\\) (see Schabas & Wennerlind 2020:\n151\u2013172). With the influx of silver from Latin America after\nColumbus, the money supply in Europe had more than doubled by 1510.\nWhile entering exclusively on Spanish ships, it spread rapidly, first\nto the Netherlands and then across Europe. Prices rose as well,\nalthough the underlying factors were not readily understood. Most\npurchases were of food, whose prices fluctuated with the harvests,\ngood and bad. Consumer durables tended to be purchased infrequently,\noften at seasonal fairs, which had complex systems for price\nnegotiations, pitching and haggling. The rise of middlemen, wholesale\nmarkets and retailing, became more prevalent in the seventeenth\ncentury, although the public was suspicious that these traders who\nlived well off their earnings were the cause of increasing prices.\nAlthough newspapers and broadsides posted prices, starting in the late\nseventeenth century, urban shopping still required negotiation. It was\nonly with the department stores of the late nineteenth century that\nprices were routinely posted.\n\nPause and reflect on how difficult it would be to discern inflation in\nthe early modern period, or perhaps even at present, and thus how\nbrilliant was the insight that the overall price level is a function\nof the money supply. In the 1520s, the Prussian Diet commissioned none\nother than Nicholas Copernicus to investigate the recent increase in\nprice instability. Drawing on his skills with handling large\nquantities of data, Copernicus\u2019s Monetae cudendae ratio\n(1526) established the proposition that the value of the currency (its\npurchasing power) had diminished due to its abundance. We thus have\nthe first inkling of a principle that is, in some respects, as central\nto economics as the principle of inertia is in physics.\n\nOthers in the second half of the sixteenth century, notably Navarrus,\nLuis de Molina, and Jean Bodin, arrived independently at a variant of\nthe quantity theory of money. A century later, John Locke and William\nPetty added two additional variables, the velocity and the\ntransactions level, to the core relation in the quantity theory of\nmoney. The velocity of money is something of a misnomer. It is the\naverage rate at which a given unit of currency turns over in a given\nperiod of time. The transactions level is the rate at which payments\nare made, for example wages (daily or weekly) or rents (quarterly).\nFor the capital bill, Petty estimated that five per cent of its value\nwas manifest in liquid terms at any point of the year, a sum\nequivalent to the interest payment. As a remedy for the shortage of\nmoney, a problem that beset not only Petty\u2019s Ireland but\nvirtually every nation, the best policy was to shorten the temporal\ninterval for the transactions level and hence increase the velocity.\nThese four variables were cemented by Irving Fisher in 1911, with his\nequation that MV = PT (money supply (M) times the velocity of money\n(V) is equal to the price level (P) times the transactions level (T)).\nFisher was also the first to measure the velocity of money. The\naverage rate for the turnover of one dollar in New Haven was twenty\ntimes per annum.\n\nThe quantity theory of money also entails the neutrality of money.\nHume broached a series of thought experiments, whereby the quantity of\nmoney in a nation doubled or halved overnight, or was reduced by an\neven greater amount, four-fifths (\u201cOf Interest\u201d [1987:\n299]; \u201cOf the Balance of Trade\u201d [1987: 311]). He argued\nthat this would have no lasting effect. In the case of an increase,\nprices would rise commensurate to the increase in money as dictated by\nthe quantity theory. As a result, imports would surge because foreign\ngoods were favorably priced, and the specie would flow out almost\nimmediately and prices return to their original level, hence what came\nto be known as the specie-flow mechanism. Earlier contributors, such\nas Mun, had already argued that money would follow trade, and hence\nthat the quantity of specie in England would reflect the balance of\ntrade. If the balance was favorable, such that exports exceeded\nimports, the nation\u2019s coffers would be augmented. Hume\nextrapolated from Mun\u2019s one nation to the entire globe. Imposing\nthe metaphor of the world\u2019s oceans, Hume argued that it was no\nmore possible to stockpile specie in a nation than to dam the oceans\nand raise them above sea-level. Each nation would see its domestic\nprices rise or fall in accordance with the quantity of money, and\nhence the strong propensity for the global supply of money to\nequilibrate in each nation in line with the balance of trade. It\nrested on a clear understanding of the distinction between the nominal\nand the real.\n\nNotwithstanding his brilliant argument for the neutrality of money,\nHume recognized that the specie-flow mechanism was never fully\nachieved; trade barriers, transaction costs, and other interferences\nwith the money supply limited its full operation. As a result, Hume\nendorsed the non-neutrality of money as more veridical. He argued\nthat, from roughly 1500 to 1750, the money supply had increased by a\nfactor of eight but the price level had only increased by a factor of\nfour. The simple reason was significant economic growth, a doubling of\noutput that required the extant money to service the significant\nincrease in transactions. The growth was stimulated by many factors,\nthe gains from trade, the division of labor, and the accumulation of\ncapital. Hume also acknowledged the importance of new technologies and\ntheir rapid spread once in place. Above all, he discerned that money\ncould engender growth, even though this remained mysterious and was\nnot \u201ceasily accounted for\u201d (Hume \u201cOf Money\u201d\n[1987: 288).\n\nHume articulated the various steps by which an influx of good Spanish\ncoins might magically stimulate economic growth. The circulation of\nthe additional coins could induce a multiplier effect that essentially\nincentivized weavers and farmers to work more intensively. They did\nthis for an interval of time, until prices and wages caught up to the\nadditional money stock and reached a level once more. In short, the\nspecie-flow mechanism was couched as an ideal (friction-free) process,\nunderstood as a thought experiment, whereas the injection of new money\nand its circulation resulted in genuine economic growth. Milton\nFriedman received the Nobel Prize for making these arguments, but he\npaid specific homage to Hume for the central analysis (Schabas &\nWennerlind 2020: 208, 232). Friedman also credits Hume with asking\nwhat the optimal quantity of money for a given nation would be, but in\nfact several before Hume had grappled with this question, Petty and\nBerkeley most notably. Hume\u2019s work is best known but there were\ndozens at the time who articulated one or more of the three core\nprinciples of monetary theory, the quantity theory, the specie-flow\nmechanism, and the multiplier.\n\nOnly the first of these three could be easily verified by empirical\nfindings. Because legal tender was issued by the royal mint, it was\npossible to estimate the money supply. Hume, for example, claimed that\nabout 90 million pounds circulated in Britain circa 1750. It was much\nmore difficult to measure changes to the price level. Consumer price\nindexing, a systematic method for measuring inflation that would serve\nto confirm the quantity theory of money, was first devised in the late\nnineteenth century and only undertaken by state agencies in the\ndecades after World War One. Nevertheless, early modern economists\ndevised clever means to measure the purchasing power of the currency,\nwhether by examining the price of corn (grains) or looking to other\nbenchmarks. William Fleetwood\u2019s Chronicon Preciosum; or an\nAccount of English Money, the Price of Corn and other Commodities for\nthe last 600 years (1707), proved an invaluable resource. He also\nmade estimates of purchasing power, noting that his stipend as a\nFellow of King\u2019s College Cambridge, which had been fixed at five\npounds in 1450 ought to be increased to thirty pounds to command the\nsame value. Adam Smith proposed the longterm silver price of corn as\nthe best metric for estimating inflation. His belief was that one must\ntake a weighted average over a longer period of time, 50 to 100 years\nin order to eliminate the seasonal variations in harvests or isolated\ndiscoveries of silver reserves.\n\nThe focus on corn prices also unleashed another central principle of\neconomics, the law of demand (quantity demanded is an inverse function\nof price). The so-called King-Davenant law, attributed to Gregory King\n(see Evans 1967) and Charles Davenant (1698) of the late seventeenth\ncentury, provided a time series analysis of corn prices (see Hutchison\n1988: 46\u201353). They argued that in the case of a severe shortage\nof corn, a fall by fifty per cent of the normal supply, the price\ncould increase by forty-five per cent. They also provided data in the\ncase of a bountiful harvest. Their chart established that the function\nwas an inverse one and, significantly, nonlinear.\n\nThe early modern period was plagued by a shortage of coins, and of\nthose in circulation, most were clipped or hammered. Gresham\u2019s\nlaw, that bad coins drive out the good ones, explained this phenomenon\nvery well. It was estimated that the average coin had only half of the\nmetallic content that had been stipulated by the mint. This meant that\ncountless people were filing the coins and melting the shavings into\nbullion for additional remuneration from the mint. It was illegal to\ntamper with coins, and for most countries of Western Europe, the death\npenalty applied, even if one was caught simply with the tools of the\ntrade. Other commonplace illegal activities were counterfeiting paper\nbanknotes, bribery, smuggling, and adulterating products for sale. It\nwould be difficult to estimate the overall level of such activities,\nbut a background assumption in the writings of most early modern\neconomists was the understanding that criminal methods were widespread\n(see Wennerlind 2011). The demise of Spain had become a trope, insofar\nas it had been illegally drained of its American silver. As Hume\nnoted, smugglers in the previous two centuries had taken the Spanish\nsilver over the Pyrenees where French prices were one-tenth those in\nSpain (\u201cOf the Balance of Trade\u201d [1987: 312]). The money\nhad saturated most where there was international trade. By the early\nseventeenth century, it was the Dutch East India Company that\ncommanded the envy of European traders, and its legacy was such that\nMexican silver coins continued to dominate Asian trade until the\nnineteenth century.\n\nEarly modern philosophers weighed in on legal monetary interventions,\nnotably debasement, devaluation, or recoinage. For most, the preferred\npolicy was to leave the money stock untouched, or restore its nominal\nmetallic value given the widespread hammering and clipping of coins.\nIn the fourteenth century, the French crown had altered the currency,\nmostly with debasements, more than eighty times. As Bodin recognized,\nthis increased the money supply and hence raised prices, but it also\nundermined confidence in the stability of the currency. There is no\ngreater incident of leading philosophers tampering with the money\nsupply than when Locke and Newton famously oversaw the Great Recoinage\nof 1696. Locke persuaded Newton to do the opposite of a debasement,\nnamely to restore the silver content of the shilling to the amount\nstipulated by Elizabeth I circa 1600 (see Appleby 1978; Vaughn 1980).\nNewton thus affirmed Locke\u2019s belief in essentialism (see\nCaffentzis 1989). This meant that those willing to break the law\nbenefitted from a de facto money pump, and the crown lost\nsome two million pounds (roughly thirty million pounds in total was in\ncirculation). This contraction of the money supply engendered an\neconomic downturn, but for other reasons the English economy began to\nexpand and flourish under the reign of Queen Anne.\n\nIn their analysis of the essential properties of money, a number of\nearly modern philosophers climbed several rungs of the ladder of\nmonetary abstraction. George Berkeley, in his short tract The\nQuerist (1725), recognized that the substance used for money was\nirrelevant, and thus promoted the concept of fiat money, a counter or\ntoken that was recognized as legal tender but not redeemable for a\nprecious metal. (Caffentzis 2000). Benjamin Franklin (1729) proposed a\nnovel schema whereby notes were issued with the land as the underlying\nasset, but the practice was short-lived in colonial Pennsylvania.\nHume, while secretary to the British ambassador in France in 1765,\noversaw the dismantling of a fiat-currency in Qu\u00e9bec that had\ncommenced in 1685 and the reinstatement of British Sterling in lower\nCanada.\n\nIn his Treatise, Hume broached the idea that money is\nanalogous to language, both in its commencement in a prehistoric age,\nand in the sense that its primary role is to represent value, much as\nwords represent objects (see Schabas & Wennerlind 2020:\n99\u2013101). Neither money nor language adequately refer to objects\nin this sense, but we tend to be duped into thinking that they do.\nBecause of this imperfect mapping, and the fact that money embodies a\npledge, a type of speech act, Hume was also inclined to appreciate\npaper banknotes, whether from private banks or the Exchequer. He did\nnot share Locke\u2019s view that nature had stamped an indelible\nvalue on gold and silver. Hume grasped that credit forms a continuum\nwith money, and noted that there was a range of degrees of liquidity:\nmortgages, bonds, equities, promissory notes, bills of exchange, and\nso forth. Hume praised the recent innovations of Scottish bankers, to\ndevise daily lines of credit so that merchants might monetize idle\ncapital, and to issue ten-shilling notes denominated such that\nordinary tradesmen might use them. He estimated that in 1750, over\nhalf the transactions in Britain were conducted with paper-notes, thus\nlubricating the wheels of trade that much the better.\n\nSmith was more inclined to see banking and credit as precarious, and\ncaptured this sentiment with his metaphor of paper money as a\n\u201csort of wagon-way through the air\u201d, bolstered by its\n\u201cDaedalian wings\u201d (Smith 1776 [1976: 321]). If banks were\nreckless with their issuance, their bills would soar in value and\nbecome over-heated, as witnessed in the serious bank failures of 1772.\nSmith in general was more circumspect about the benefits of merchants\nand overseas trade, and he argued for firm regulations to be imposed\non banks and credit markets.\n\nIn the early 1670s, Shaftesbury, who had become chancellor of the\nExchequer, encouraged Locke to oppose a measure that would set a legal\nceiling of four percent on the interest rate. Locke revisited the\ndebate in 1692, and in both cases, persuaded the government to keep a\nhigher ceiling. Locke argued that in a world of perfectly competitive\nbanking a \u201cnatural\u201d rate of interest would override the\nlegal one (see Vaughn 1980). Ironically, he made his arguments before\nthe monopolistic Bank of England was formed in 1694. Jeremy\nBentham\u2019s Defence of Usury (1787), in opposition to\nSmith, restored Locke\u2019s position that the interest rate ought to\nbe unregulated and hence subject solely to market forces (see Sigot\n2001). Smith\u2019s position has remained a puzzle, since for the\nmost part, interest rates were low and hence non-usurious, and because\nSmith in general embraced laissez-faire thinking (see\nHollander 1999). Both Hume and Smith recognized the longterm tendency\nof the interest rate to fall, from ten percent under Elizabeth I to\nthree or four percent in their day, and they arrived at the more\nprofound understanding that this was due to capital accumulation and\nsophisticated commerce and trade. They did not articulate the\nprinciple of zero profits, but they understood that in a perfectly\ncompetitive world, the profit rate would equal the interest rate, the\ncost of borrowing capital.\n\nThe most central leitmotif of early modern economics was its\nappreciation for the transformative effects of money. Hobbes, drawing\non William Harvey, had depicted money as the blood that courses\nthrough the body politic (see Christensen 1989; Apeldoorn 2017). Money\nvitalized a region, and was most effective if it was in circulation\nand \u201cquickened\u201d, that is, increased its velocity. Quesnay\nunderscored the importance of the circulation of money, particularly\nbullion, and its multiplier effects, again drawing an analogy to\nHarvey\u2019s great discovery. The French had initially, under the\ninspiration of the Scottish \u00e9migr\u00e9 John Law (1705),\nembraced private banknotes and equity swaps. But after the collapse of\nthe Mississippi Company in 1720, for which Law was blamed, they chose\nto hoard silver as household plate, and banking did not recover until\nthe end of the century. The Dutch and the British, looking to France,\nimposed a tax on silverware and promoted the use of chinaware as\nmeasures to reduce hoarding.\n\nIn the second of his Two Treatise of Government (1689), Locke\nprovided an important fable as to how money came into being as a store\nof wealth given the existence of perishable goods. Hume, conversely,\nemphasized money as a medium of exchange, as the \u201coil\u201d\nwhich lubricated the \u201cwheels of trade\u201d (\u201cOf\nMoney\u201d [1987: 281]). Hume\u2019s story looked more to the\nallure of luxury goods and the rise of towns and cities as prompting\nthe thorough monetization of the countryside, such that \u201cno hand\nis entirely empty of it [money]\u201d (ibid. [1987: 294]). Once this\nwas achieved, however, money took on a power of its own, one that no\ngovernment could adequately control. As a general maxim, Hume declared\nthat\n\n\na government has great reason to preserve with care its people and its\nmanufactures. Its money, it may safely trust to the course of human\naffairs, without fear or jealousy. (\u201cOf the Balance of\nTrade\u201d [1987: 326])\n\n\nMoney may well be a human artifact, but as Hume and Smith, among\nothers, argued, it operated according to laws that transcended\nindividual human agency. \u201cMoney answers all things\u201d, to\nquote the title of Jacob Vanderlint\u2019s influential book of 1734.\nMoney had become so complex and so deeply entrenched in the social\nfabric of modern commercial society that measures to retain or channel\nit were believed to be futile.\n7. Scientific Status of Economics and its Methodology\n\nNewton lay down the gauntlet in his well-known Query 31 to\nthe Opticks (1704), namely that his methods for deciphering\nthe natural world might prove efficacious in understanding the moral\nsphere. Many took up his plea to advance the moral sciences. In\nFrance, one could name Voltaire, Condillac and Condorcet, and in\nBritain, Hutcheson, Hume, and Smith. The common conviction was to\nidentify sufficient uniformities to human nature that resulted in\nmanifest patterns, whether in the economic or political sphere.\nHume\u2019s associationist psychology and the copy principle implied\nremarkable uniformity in the machinery of the human mind, while Smith\ntreated the sympathetic regard as akin to gravitational attraction.\nBoth believed that introspection meant that the moral sciences,\nincluding economics could become epistemically superior to the natural\nsciences. As both Hume and Smith pointed out, pre-modern philosophers\nhad endorsed a geocentric universe for thousands of years and in\nmodern times, mistakenly adhered to the system of Cartesian vortices\nfor almost a century. Nothing compared to the occasionalism of\nMalebranche, that Hume deemed \u201ca fairy land\u201d (Hume 1748\n[2000: 57]). In the moral realm, however, we could know right away if\nsomething is as fanciful as a system of vortices. Both Hume and Smith\nwere fallibilists about all knowledge, but they each argued that we\nare more likely to know when we are wrong in the moral sphere than in\nthe physical sphere. Introspection and experience of the world were\nimportant assets in this respect. But, as Hume averred, \u201cnature\nwill forever elude our grasp\u201d, and even if we dig more deeply\ninto the microphysical realm, this would simply expose the need for\nfurther investigations.\n\nThe scientific spirit that Hume and Smith brought to their economics\nwas already present a century earlier; both Hobbes and Petty voiced\nthe aspiration of rendering morals into a quantitative discourse.\n\u201cCommercial mathematics\u201d took hold during the first half\nof the seventeenth century and many of the formal methods that have\nbecome commonplace in postwar economics were first adopted in the\nearly modern period (see Redman 1997; Sylla 2003). Blaise\nPascal\u2019s wager to believe in God (1670 [1910]) and Daniel\nBernoulli\u2019s Saint Petersburg paradox (1738 [1954]) are\npreliminary examples of decision theory (see Hutchison 1988). Both\nimposed probability measures on expected utilities and thus provided\nthe scaffolding of what has become an important line of inquiry in\nmainstream economics. Pierre de Fermat (1654) [1962] and Christiaan\nHuygens (1657) also studied games of chance (see Klein 1997). Game\ntheoretical modes of thinking permeated the works of Hobbes and Hume\n(see Hampton 1986; Kavka 1986; Hardin 2007). Hume also articulated\ncore elements of decision theory, including the idea of time\ndiscounting (see Diaye & Lapidus 2019; Sugden 2021).\n\nUndergirding these preliminary efforts at both decision theory and\ngame theory was a clear appreciation for strategic behavior, more or\nless a given among early modern philosophers following in the wake of\nMachiavelli. No one was more vocal on the widespread tendency to\nstrategize for individual gain than Mandeville. As he observed,\neveryone in commercial society was duplicitous, dressing to a higher\nstation, and rationalizing their frequent breach of ethical norms. It\nwas well known that the hand holding the scales of justice \u201chad\noften dropt \u2018em, brib\u2019d with Gold\u201d (Mandeville 1714\n[1988: 8]). Smith would echo these sentiments of duplicity:\n\n\ncivil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of\nproperty, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against\nthe poor, or of those who have some property against those who have\nnone at all. (Smith 1776 [1976: 715])\n\n\nIt is important to see that the rise of game theory in mainstream\neconomics since the mid-twentieth century is to some extent an\nunwitting revival of ascriptions of strategizing and power imbalances\nthat were commonplace in the early modern period.\n\nProbability theory was developed in the early modern period, notably\nby Huygens and Abraham de Moivre (see Daston 1988). The early\neighteenth-century English mathematician, John Arbuthnot, undertook\ncalculations that resembled Neyman-Pearson testing (see Stigler 1986:\n226). Hume may have copied this method, as a young admirer of\nArbuthnot. Hume\u2019s 100-page essay on population pivoted around\nthe null hypothesis that ancient Rome was more populated than Europe\nin 1750, and he ably demonstrated that the likelihood that this was\nthe case was vanishingly small. Hume may also have appreciated the\ninsights of Thomas Bayes, who devised his theorem\u2014now known as\nBayesianism\u2014in the 1750s, with a posthumous publication in 1764\n(see Raynor 1980).\n\nHume appealed explicitly to the law of large numbers and invoked a\nnumber of mean-reverting tendencies, as in his commitment to uniform\nwages, prices and interest rates. Quantitative efforts to measure\npopulation or the money supply were undertaken with much regularity\nstarting in the 1660s, despite a paucity of data (Endres 1985;\nDerringer 2018). Many, such as Graunt, understood the value of\ntrimming outliers and seeking what Thomas Simpson (1755) coined as the\narithmetic mean (see Stigler 1986; Klein 1997). Smith\u2019s analysis\nof the wage spectrum was grounded in the belief that market forces had\nestablished stable and salient wages for each type of trade, and that\ndeviations could be reduced down to his list of six key factors (Smith\n1776 [1976: 82\u2013104]).\n\nThere were some efforts at model building in the eighteenth century.\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Melon (1734), whose work was widely known,\nconstructed a model based on three similar islands with two goods in\ncirculation (see Hont 2005: 30\u201332). Quesnay\u2019s tableau\n\u00e9conomique (1758) was the most celebrated model. His\ndisciple, Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours, published a treatise in\n1768 that promoted physiocracy as a \u201cnew science\u201d on equal\nstanding with the natural sciences. Adam Smith intended to dedicate\nthe Wealth of Nations to Quesnay, but he died too soon.\n\nQuesnay\u2019s model made stylized assumptions about the French\nnation, ascribing three distinct classes: a quarter were landowners\n(aristocrats), a quarter artisans, and half farmers. He showed\nvisually that after the initial payment of rent (the annual net\nproduct) by the farmers to the landowners, the entire unfolding of the\neconomy would reach mathematical closure by the time of the next\nharvest and, like a perpetual motion machine, prompt the next period\nof production and distribution. No sector would increase or decrease\nin size and each would have its just reward in accordance with its\nstation (a stylized assumption was that landowners consumed twice as\nmuch as the others, per capita). Quesnay also, brilliantly, introduced\ndisturbances, for example, an unduly high interest rate, a tax, or an\nincreased demand for artisanal goods, to demonstrate the rapid\ndisequilibration of his system (see Quesnay 1758-1759). Contemporary\nmodelling thrives on introducing slight variations or manipulations to\ndisclose the underlying structure and is much indebted to Quesnay (see\nHausman 2003 [2021]; Morgan 2012).\n8. Distributive Justice\n\nAs was recognized at the time, the transition from feudalism to\ncapitalism commenced by the early sixteenth century. In his\nHistory of England, Hume argued that commerce arose in\nBritain under Henry VII circa 1500, drawing on the Flemish trade.\nSmith shared this view, and both looked to the Italian city-states of\nFlorence and Genoa a century before as critical developments. The\nshift to capitalism intensified, as both Hume and Smith recognized,\nwith the rise of the joint-stock companies, particularly the East\nIndia companies of the Dutch, French and English.\n\nThere may be no single event or even decade to mark the transition to\ncapitalism. Aristotle\u2019s analysis of the agora in central Athens\nreminds us that markets and money were commonplace in antiquity. What\nsets capitalism apart is the emergence and central role of markets for\nthe three factors of production\u2014land, labour, and\ncapital\u2014and it was these that took hold during the sixteenth\ncentury. By the end of that century, possibly galvanized by other\nmajor transformations, notably the Reformation and the Scientific\nRevolution, it had become evident that prominent bankers and merchants\nwere wealthier than many aristocrats. By the mid-1600s, half the\npeople in the Netherlands lived in towns or cities and most were\nwage-earners.\n\nLand was still the primary source of wealth, and merchants were\nrenowned for retiring to a country estate. And there was widespread\nsuspicion of upstarts, not to mention appeals to the longstanding\nadage that the newly-acquired wealth would disappear by the third\ngeneration. Moreover, there was a deeply-rooted belief in the\nnecessity of ranks, most explicitly voiced by Millar and Smith.\nDespite the considerable expansion of domestic manufacturing in\nWestern Europe, there was a pronounced predilection, at least among\nthe Physiocrats and Adam Smith, to foreground the agrarian sector and\nview the aristocratic landowning class as an essential part of the\neconomic picture. Historical studies justify this emphasis. Until the\ntwentieth century, the majority of capital was invested in the\nagrarian sector, far more than in manufacturing or trade. If anything\nbest characterizes the early modern period, it was the sustained\nincrease in population due to improved fishing and agrarian\nyields.\n\nEgalitarian ideals reach back to ancient times, but in early modern\nphilosophy the arguments appeared to have more efficacy. Locke,\nRousseau, Paine, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft are just some\nof the more significant philosophers who left their mark on the modern\ntransition to a more equal society. Diderot was an important voice for\nthe abolition of the slave trade and slavery. Both Hume and Smith\nargued that wage labor was more efficient than slavery and thus gave\neconomic motivations for the significant end to slavery that came to\npass in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe primary emphasis in the early modern period was on the rights of\nthe \u201cmiddling sorts\u201d, merchants, bankers, and\nmanufacturers, in contrast to the landed aristocracy. Fiscal policy,\nas a means to address economic inequality and serve middle-class\ninterests, spawned a large body of thought, running from Hobbes to\nHume and finally to Smith, whose principles of taxation became\ncanonical until John Stuart Mill. Hume\u2019s essay \u201cOf the\nMiddle Station of Life\u201d, in conjunction with his writings on\neconomics, makes plain that this group would provide the impetus for\nfuture economic growth. The commercial class was far more likely to be\nindustrious and enterprising, and serve as the backbone of modern\ncivil society and the custodians of liberal values. In his Enquiry\nConcerning the Principles of Morals (1751), Hume portrays a\nhypothetical son-in-law, Cleanthes, as a paragon of virtue. He was\nalso a lawyer and businessman and, as the father of Hume\u2019s\nhypothetical grandchildren, the one most likely to insure that the\nfamily name would be sustained for at least one more generation.\n\nThe early modern philosophers reflected on the principles of\ninternational distributive justice and its implications for global\npeace. As Istvan Hont highlighted, the rich-country/poor-country\nquestion was vigorously debated in the eighteenth century (Hont 2005).\nGershom Carmichael and Hutcheson, for example, gave voice to these\nconcerns, but it was Hume and Smith who laid the analytic foundations.\nA country was wealthier than another not because of specie but because\nof its people and its accumulated capital in agriculture and\nmanufacturing. Josiah Tucker (1755) gave voice to the potential for\nunlimited growth, noting that higher wages were correlated with more\nskilled labor and capital infrastructure. Both Hume and Smith\nadvocated high wages, but feared that with time capital would be\nshifted to countries with lower wages until those regions were also\nenriched. Because of increasing demand worldwide, however, there was\nno reason to suppose that a nation with a healthy export sector would\ndecline. As was widely understood, Holland was testament to the\npotential of long-lived wealth, having sustained its significant\nfoothold in global trade since it reached its apogee as the most\npowerful economic nation in the 1620s.\n\nSmith is recognized as the critical figure to shift attention to the\nworking class and to advocate higher wages. He noted that merchants\nand manufacturers are strongly inclined to collude so as not to raise\nwages (Smith 1776 [1976: 267]). He noted the degradation of workers\nwho were compelled to spend their entire lives \u201cperforming a few\nsimple operations\u201d (1776 [1976: 782]). With pointed words, he\nunderscored the dehumanizing effects of unvaried work, such that a\ntypical person\n\n\ngenerally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human\ncreature to become. (1776 [1976: 782])\n\n\nSmith believed this would become widespread. In\n\n\nevery improved and civilised society this is the state into which the\nlabouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must\nnecessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent it.\n(1776 [1976: 782])\n\n\nSmith advocated widespread schooling, with mechanics and gymnastics,\nand the fostering of theatre or dancing on the day of rest. He\nbelieved that inventions often came from the shopfloor, and that a\nmore orderly standing army would be fostered by men who learned to\ndevelop both body and mind.\n\nAbove all, Smith exposed the emptiness of the pursuit of wealth, that\nit consisted primarily in \u201cthe parade of riches\u201d, which\nfeeds upon the envy of those without (Smith 1776 [1976: 190]). The\nrich garner far more pleasure from being observed riding in a carriage\nthan from the comforts a carriage might offer. Our efforts to pursue\nwealth and power stem from the universal desire for admiration and\napprobation. There is also a deep asymmetry in Smith\u2019s account\nof human sympathy, the act of fellow-feeling, in that we sympathize\nwith the rich and shun the poor. The reason is that we imagine\nourselves in their place and thus fill in the gaps of our otherwise\ninadequate lives. It is for this reason, Smith believes, that the\nstate must insure that royalty indulge in opulent displays. Ranks are\nof great importance in the world, for motivating us to strive, driven\nby \u201cthe desire of bettering our condition\u201d (Smith 1776\n[1976: 341]). Smith believed that we are a restless lot, that\n\n\nthere is scarce perhaps a single instant in which any man is so\nperfectly and completely satisfied with his situation, as to be\nwithout any wish of alteration or improvement of any kind. An\naugmentation of fortune is the means by which the greater part of men\npropose and wish to better their condition. (1776 [1976: 341])\n\n\nAs a result, there is nothing worse than a fall from grace and ensuing\nloss of admiration. Smith observes that \u201cbankruptcy is perhaps\nthe greatest and most humiliating calamity which can befall an\ninnocent man\u201d and its fear has thus fostered widespread prudence\nin the modern commercial world (Smith 1776 [1976: 342]).\n\nSmith\u2019s portrayal of human nature is tinged with these dark\nthoughts, similar to the cynicism of Mandeville. We spend our entire\nlife attempting to garner approval, grounded in the sympathetic\nregard, and are for the most part prone to vanity and greed. His\nparable about the poor man\u2019s son, who is driven by ambition to\nbecome wealthy only to realize at the end of his life that the\nindignities he suffered \u201cto serve those whom he hates\u201d and\nto be \u201cobsequious to those whom he despises\u201d have robbed\nhim of a \u201creal tranquillity\u201d that he might have achieved\nhad he known his place and remained poor. (Smith 1759 [1976: 181]).\nOnly at the end of his life does he grasp that \u201cwealth and\ngreatness are mere trinkets\u201d, and that the loss of friendship\nand the \u201cinjustice of his enemies\u201d that he has suffered as\nhe climbed upwards has left him bereft of peace of mind (ibid.). Smith\nremarks that the beggar on the highway sleeps better than the king,\nand that the better aim in life is to achieve inner equanimity. Adam\nSmith, the philosopher most readily associated with the voice of\ncapitalism, could not be more disparaging about its tendencies to\nreinforce the baser features of human nature. While he endorsed rising\nstandards of living for the lower orders, his stoicism was the more\ndominant sentiment. Life was a lottery and one had best prepare for\nadversity. As Smith aptly put it, wealth might \u201ckeep off the\nsummer shower, [but] not the winter storm\u201d (Smith 1759 [1976:\n183]). Early modern economics thus offered practical wisdom and served\nas a major resource for forging a wise and virtuous life.\n",
