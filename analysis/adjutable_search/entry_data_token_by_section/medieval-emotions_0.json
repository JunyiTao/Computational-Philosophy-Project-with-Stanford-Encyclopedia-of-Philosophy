    "main_text": "Ancient Sources\n1. Ancient Sources\n\nThe philosophical analysis of emotions was introduced by Plato and\ndeveloped further by Aristotle. In the fourth Book of his\nRepublic, Plato famously divided the soul into three parts:\nthe rational part (logistikon), the spirited part\n(thumoeides), and the appetitive part\n(epithum\u00eatikon). This terminology was also used by\nAristotle and later ancient philosophers, even though its\nphilosophical background assumptions varied. The Latin terms for the\ncorresponding parts were intellectus, irascibilis\nand concupiscibilis. Plato\u2019s view of emotions was\nbasically negative, with the exception of love in the\nPhaedrus and the educational capacity of the spirited part in\nthe Republic and the Laws. He regarded the emotions\nas irrational reactions of the lower psychosomatic levels of the soul,\nof which the appetitive part sought sensual pleasure and avoided\nsuffering and the spirited part was the seat of self-affirmation and\naggression. The immaterial reasoning part was the subject of knowledge\nand rational will. It was meant to govern the emotional parts by\nreducing the activity of the appetitive part as much as possible and\ncontrolling spontaneous suggestions of the spirited part and\nhabituating it to supporting good conduct. Plato supplied the\nemotional parts with a measure of non-intellectual cognitive\nevaluation with respect to perceptual representations and took them to\nbe accompanied by pleasant or unpleasant feelings and related\naction-initiating impulses. Plato\u2019s main reason for this\ntripartition was the phenomenon of acrasy: while the undisturbed\nknowledge of right conduct makes people behave accordingly,\nuncontrolled lower impulses may draw them in other directions, most\ntypically toward immediate pleasures or aggression. \n\nThe various aspects Plato associated with the dynamic movements of the\nlower soul were more systematically discussed in Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory of emotions as part of the human condition. Aristotle developed\na detailed model for analyzing the psychological structure of\noccurrent emotions, which included four basic aspects, most\nextensively discussed in the section on emotions in the second book of\nthe Rhetoric. First, the cognitive element is an\nunpremeditated evaluation (belief or phantasy) that something positive\nor negative happens or may happen to the subject or to someone else in\na way which concerns the subject. Second, the affective\nelement is a subjectively felt pleasant or unpleasant feeling about\nthe content of the evaluation. Third, the dynamic element is\na behavioral impulse towards action which typically accompanies\nemotional evaluation. Fourth, there are typical physiological\nreactions such as the changes in the heartbeat. (For emotions in Plato\nand Aristotle, see Cooper 1999; Fortenbaugh 2003; Lorenz 2006; Price\n2010; Dow 2015.)\n\nThe compositional approach has been very influential in Western\nthought. As for the first element, practically all ancient and\nmedieval theories were cognitive, associating some kind of evaluative\nrepresentation with an emotion as its principal constituent. While the\nStoics, following their reason-centered rationalist psychology, argued\nthat it is philosophically sufficient to treat emotions simply as\nmistaken value-judgments, it was more common in ancient and medieval\ntimes to follow the view of Plato and Aristotle, who distinguished\nbetween the non-emotional intellectual power and the lower emotional\nparts of the soul, which were eliminated by the Stoics. This was the\nprevailing medieval view until the Franciscan conception of the\npassions of the intellectual faculty of the will (Knuuttila 2004).\n\nAs distinct from Plato\u2019s control model, Aristotle proposed that\neducation may change the emotional dispositions so that their\naffective evaluations and inclinations support the quest for the good\nlife instead of disrupting it. This was the basis of his theory of the\nvirtues, which included the good emotional habits of the sensory soul\nand the good habits of the practical reason. As part of his\nphilosophical psychology, Aristotle developed a considered theory of\nhow the rational part may co-operate with the powers of the sensory\npart (Irwin 2017). \n\nPlato and Aristotle presented some lists of emotions, the most\nextensive being in Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric II.1\u201311\n(cf. Plato, Timaeus 69d; Laws I.644c-d; Aristotle,\nNicomachean ethics II.5, 1005b21\u201323), but they did not\ndevelop any systematic taxonomy of emotions except considering some as\nthe affects of the appetitive part and some of the irascible part.\nBecause of the feeling aspect always being associated with an\nemotional representation, Aristotle sometimes distinguished emotions\non the basis of whether the emotional evaluation was pleasant or\nunpleasant; see also Aspasius\u2019 commentary on the Nicomachean\nEthics (41.28\u201343.32). The first elaborated taxonomy was put\nforward by the Stoics, who divided emotions into four basic types,\ndepending on whether the object was regarded as a present or future\ngood or a present or future evil:\n\n\n\n\nTime \n\n\n\nPresent\nFuture \n\nValue\nGood\nPleasure\nDesire \n\nEvil\nDistress\nFear  \n\n\nThe Stoics produced longer lists of particular emotions included in\nthese four types. (See Pseudo-Andronicus of Rhodes, Peri\nPath\u00f4n, ed. Glibert-Thirry, I.1\u20135; Diogenes Laertius\nVII.110\u201314; Stobaeus II.90.7\u201392.17.) The fourfold\nclassification was quoted in many well-known works, such as\nAugustine\u2019s The City of God (XIV.5\u20139) and\nBoethius\u2019 Consolation of Philosophy (I.7, 25\u201328),\nand it was generally known in medieval times, although the Stoic\nexplanation of emotions as such did not garner followers. \n\nA well-known part of Stoic philosophy is the philosophical therapy of\nemotions (therapeia) described in works by Cicero, Seneca and\nEpictetus. Stoic therapy aimed at apatheia, the extirpation\nof emotions, as a consequence of learning to see things in accordance\nwith the Stoic conception of rational reality without self-centered\ncommitments. Emotions were typically regarded as false judgments about\nthe value of things and the behavioral reactions to them. The Stoics\noften described the types of emotion by referring to their typical\npsychosomatic reactions, but the positive beliefs about the propriety\nof these expressive movements and corresponding actions were regarded\nas irrational. The elements of the Stoic therapy were known in later\nLatin philosophy through Cicero\u2019s Tusculan\ndisputations, Seneca\u2019s On anger and some Christian\nsources. Other Hellenistic philosophers such as Plutarch generally\nfollowed the psychology of Plato and Aristotle, arguing for the\nmoderation of the emotions (metriopatheia). The Stoic\napatheia was regarded as impossible because of the emotional\npart of the soul and as inhumane insensitivity with respect to other\npeople. Plotinus and his Neoplatonic followers argued for\napatheia, though this did not involve the disappearance of\nthe emotional part\u2014earthly emotions became useless in higher\nNeoplatonic spheres (see Nussbaum 1994; Sorabji 2000). \n\nThe Alexandrian theologians Clemens and Origen combined Stoic and\nPlatonist ideas, arguing that freedom from emotion was part of\nChristian perfectibility and the precondition for divinization through\nparticipation in divine love (agap\u00ea). This mystical\nunion was described in highly emotional language, but supernaturally\ncaused spiritual feelings as experiences of the apathetic soul were\nnot called simply emotions. John Cassian made this combination of\ndivine love with freedom from mundane emotions known in Western\nmonasticism. It was employed in influential treatises by Gregory the\nGreat and Bernard of Clairvaux. While this approach was also present\nin the Cappadocian fathers and Augustine, they stressed the importance\nof Platonic control and moderation in everyday life to their\nnon-monastic audience. \n\nThe monastic literature on mystical ascent developed introspective\nanalysis of subjective feeling, which Bernard of Clairvaux called the\nsense of being affected by divine action (sentit intra se\nactitari, Opera II, 10, 28\u201329; K\u00f6pf 1980:\n136\u2013174). Many later theologians such as Albert the Great and\nThomas Aquinas wrote commentaries on the Pseudo-Dionysius\u2019s\nworks (late fifth century), which taught on mystical experience from\nthe point of view of Christian Neoplatonism. (For ancient Christian\ndiscussions, see Hadot 1995; Knuuttila 2004; for Augustine, see also\nByers 2013; Gao 2018; for Gregory the Great, see Straw 1988; Humphries\n2013; for medieval commentaries of Pseudo-Dionysius, see Coakley and\nStang (eds., 2009); Blankenhorn 2015.\n\nMonastic psychology also made use of the originally Stoic doctrine of\nfirst movements, which Origen, followed by Augustine and many others,\napplied to the Christian conception of sin. The Stoic idea, described\nby Seneca in On Anger (2.1\u20134), was that even apathetic\npeople might react quasi-emotionally on exceptional occasions, but\nthis was not really an emotion because it did not involve judgmental\nassent. Augustine taught that sinful thoughts which easily and\nfrequently came to mind because of original sin became sins through a\nsubsequent assent (Expositio quarundam propositionum ex Epistola\nad Romanos, 2066).\n\nAccording to Augustine\u2019s influential doctrine of sin, the\noriginal fall was followed by shame, which Adam and Eve felt when they\nfound themselves being moved by the movements of the lower soul and\nthe body, the functions of which they as rational beings should\ncontrol. Original disobedience of the higher part of the soul founded\nthe functional mode of the inherited original sin in the sense of\npenal disobedience of the lower part, the relative autonomy of which\ncontinuously reminds humans of their shameful condition of not being\nwhat they should be and demands continuous control (Augustine, De\ncivitate Dei, XIV.23). Augustine held that spontaneous emotional\nagitations are emotions even though they do not involve an assent to\nthe emotional evaluation or its behavioral suggestion. In his view,\nthe Stoics did not refer to these representations as emotions because\nof their sinful pride, which prevented them from realizing the\nweakness of the fallen soul in themselves (De civitate Dei\nIX.4). Augustine thought that the occurrence of evil thoughts and\ndesires is not directly under voluntary control. The temptations are\ntherefore not accountable as sins (culpa) before one can in\nprinciple expel them from the soul. If this is not immediately done,\nthey can be regarded as being freely consented to (as all sins are)\n(De sermone Domini in monte, 12.34\u201335).\nAugustine\u2019s doctrine of sin was later developed into a detailed\ntheory of the modes of assent as the degrees of venial and mortal sin.\nAs distinct from Augustine, sinfully oriented first movements were\nincreasingly regarded as venial sins even before a free choice. This\nwas also the view of Aquinas. See Knuuttila 2004: 178\u2013192.\n\nApart from the first sinful movements, love and compassion were other\ncentral emotions in medieval theology. Misericordia was a\nLatin translation of the term eleos used in Greek philosophy\nand literature. In the Vulgate translation of the Bible, the term\nmisericordia was used of divine mercy as well as of a human\nemotion of sorrow for the misery of another. Compassio was\nnot a Classical Latin word, but it came to be employed by some\nChristian authors and then increasingly used. The reason for this new\nterminology was apparently the need for an unambiguous word that would\napply to the human part of the meaning of misericordia which\ncontinued to be used as a term with divine and human references. (See\nKonstan 2001: 106; Konstan 2006: 201\u2013216.) It was usually\nassumed that God has no emotional sorrow or pity and no other emotion\nfor that matter. Augustine wrote that \u201cpity\n(misericordia) is a kind of compassion (compassio)\nin our hearts for the misery of others which compels us to help them\nif we can\u201d (De civitate Dei IX.5). Gregory the\nGreat\u2019s understanding of compassion was similar to that of\nAugustine, and he treated it as a Christian sentiment which is\nincluded in the virtue of charity love. Because of the influence of\nGregory\u2019s works, compassion became a central notion in medieval\ntheology (Straw 2013; Coolman 2008). Quoting Augustine\u2019s\ndefinition, Aquinas explains that compassion is an emotion which as\nsuch is ethically neutral. When it is connected with charity, it\nbecomes an affective part of misericordia (mercy), a virtuous\nconcern for the miseries of others (Summa theologiae\nII.2.30). Aquinas writes that a person should be compassionate in\naffect and helpful in effect (Summa theologiae II-2.45.6, ad\n3). (See also Miner 2016.)\n",
