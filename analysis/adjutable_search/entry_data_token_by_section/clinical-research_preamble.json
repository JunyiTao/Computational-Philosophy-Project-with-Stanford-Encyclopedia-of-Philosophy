    "main_text": "\n\nClinical research attempts to address a relatively straightforward,\nand important challenge: how do we determine whether one medical\nintervention is better than another, whether it offers greater\nclinical benefit and/or poses fewer risks? Clinicians may one day be\nable to answer these questions by relying on computer models, thereby\navoiding reliance on clinical research and the ethical concerns it\nraises. Until that day, clinical researchers begin by testing\npotential new medical interventions in the laboratory, and often in\nanimals. While these methods can provide valuable information and, in\nthe case of animal research, raise important ethical issues of their\nown, potential new interventions eventually must be tested in human\nbeings. Interventions which work miracles in test tubes and in mice,\noften leave humans untouched, or worse off.\n\nTesting medical interventions in humans typically poses some\nrisks to the participants, no matter how many laboratory and\nanimal tests precede it. In this way, the process of collecting\ndata through clinical trials to improve health and well-being\ninevitably exposes research participants to some risks for the benefit\nof future patients. This brings us to the central ethical challenge\nposed by clinical research: When is it ethically permissible to expose\nresearch participants to risks of harm for the benefit of others? The\npresent entry focuses on this concern, and canvasses the most\nprominent attempts to address it. The present entry largely brackets\nthe range of interesting and important ethical challenges that arise\nin the course of conducting clinical research: How should it be\nreviewed? Who may conduct it? What must potential participants\nunderstand to give valid consent? May it be conducted in countries\nthat will not be able to afford the intervention being tested? Do\ninvestigators have any obligations to treat unrelated medical\nconditions in participants that they uncover during the course of\ntheir research?\n\nOne might attempt to address the central ethical challenge by limiting\nclinical research to the medical setting, offering experimental\ninterventions to patients who want to try them. This approach, which\nhas the virtue of evaluating interventions in the process of trying to\nhelp individual patients, makes sense for comparisons of two or more\ninterventions that are widely accepted and already in clinical use. In\ncontrast, this approach poses enormous scientific and practical\nproblems with respect to testing new interventions. On the practical\nside, who would be willing to manufacture a new intervention without\nknowing whether it works? What dose should be used? How often should\nthe new drug be taken? More importantly, this approach might not yield\nreliable information as to whether the new treatment is useful or\nharmful until hundreds, perhaps thousands of people have received it.\nClinical research is designed to address these concerns by\nsystematically assessing potential new treatments in a small number of\nindividuals, including very sick ones, before offering them more\nwidely. As we go about our daily lives, driving cars, flushing our\nwaste down the drain, exhaling, getting a dog, we inevitably expose\nothers to risks of harm. Despite the fact that these practices pervade\nour lives, there has been surprisingly little philosophical analysis\nof the conditions under which they are acceptable (Hayenhjelm and\nWolff 2012). In addition to being of value in its own right,\nevaluation of the central ethical challenge posed by clinical research\nthus provides an opportunity to consider one of the more fundamental\nconcerns in moral theory: when is it acceptable to expose some\nindividuals to risks of harm?\n",
