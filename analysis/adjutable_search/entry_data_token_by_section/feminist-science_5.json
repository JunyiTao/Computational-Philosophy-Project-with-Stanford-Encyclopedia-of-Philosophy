    "main_text": "Feminist Methodology\n3. Feminist Methodology\n\nThe discussion of methodology in this section focuses on the social\nsciences, primarily because it is in these fields that most of the\ndebate on this topic has taken place. \u201cMethodology\u201d is\nunderstood following Harding\u2019s distinction between method,\nmethodology, and epistemology. Methods are \u201ctechniques for\ngathering evidence\u201d, whereas methodology is \u201ca theory and\nanalysis of how research should proceed\u201d. Epistemology is the\n\u201ctheory of knowledge or justificatory strategy\u201d that\nunderlies the methodology (Harding 1987: 2). This three-way\ndistinction provides a framework for thinking about the relationship\namong method, methodology, and epistemology. The framework is\nreflected in sociologist Joey Sprague\u2019s account of feminist\nmethodology. \n\n\nEach methodology is founded on either explicit or, more often,\nunexamined assumptions about what knowledge is and how knowing is best\naccomplished; together, these assumptions constitute a particular\nepistemology. That is, a methodology works out the implications of\na specific epistemology for how to implement a method. (Sprague\n2016: 5)\n\n\nSome feminists have been skeptical about the capacity of conventional\nresearch methods to address feminist interests and goals. But others\nhave chosen to use conventional methods in support of those goals.\nConsequently, a review of feminist social science gives no reason to\nthink that there are any particular methods that are distinctively\nfeminist. And indeed feminist research often uses a plurality of\nmethods or \u201cmixed methods\u201d\u2014usually the combined use\nof both qualitative and quantitative methods within a single research\nproject. Nonetheless, there are elements of methodology that do seem\ndistinctly feminist. Most notable among these is the core commitment\nto \u201cstart research from the lives of women\u201d\u2014their\nlived experience.\n\nThe idea that research should start from the lived experiences of\nthose who are studied suggests an ethnographic approach and it is\nperhaps for this reason feminists have been thought to favor\nqualitative methods. But the frequent use of statistical\n(quantitative) methods used to support feminist goals belies this\nidea. Londa Schiebinger offers an example from primatology. In the\n1970s Jeanne Altmann (1974) used representative sampling techniques to\neffectively change research. The opportunistic sampling that this\napproach replaced failed to note the frequency and duration of\nbehavior among primates and so gave a distorted picture of primate\nlife, emphasizing high drama events centering around reproduction and\nmale conflict over commonplace events. The role of females in the\ngroup and family life had thus been overlooked (Schiebinger 1999:\n7).\n\nThe rise of quantitative methods throughout the social sciences has\nbeen associated with the idea that greater objectivity can be achieved\nthrough numerical representation (see Porter 1995 for an account of\nthe history of this view). The notion that quantitative methods are\nmore objective is again closely tied to an understanding of science as\nvalue-free and the desire to make the social sciences more\n\u201cscientific\u201d. In comparison qualitative methods like those\ninvolved in ethnographic research\u2014interviews, participant\nobservation, and the like\u2014appear to be vulnerable to\nsubjectivity. A more accurate understanding of what feminist\nmethodology is, how it relates to the choice of method, and what this\nhas to do with epistemological commitments requires a more nuanced\naccount than focusing on quantitative/qualitative divide in method can\nprovide.\n\nWhat does it mean to say a methodology is feminist? As\nSprague puts it, \n\n\nwhile feminists are a very heterogeneous group and we disagree on many\nissues, there are two points on which we have consensus: (1) gender,\nin interaction with other forms of social relations such as\nrace/ethnicity, class, ability, and nation, is a key organizer of\nsocial life; and (2) understanding how things work is not\nenough\u2014we need to take action to make the social world more\nequitable. (Sprague 2016: 3) \n\n\nA feminist methodology is one that is shaped by and serves these\ncommitments. It requires adopting approaches and methods that are\nsensitive to the key structural elements of social life and it aims at\nproducing knowledge that can be used to further feminist goals.\nMinimally, meeting those requirements calls for starting research from\nthe lives of women\u2014that is, starting research from the daily\nexperiences of their lives. Feminist methodological approaches are\nstrongly unified in this respect and it is this aspect of feminist\nmethodology that much feminist epistemology is responsive to. We see\nthis particularly in philosophical accounts of feminist standpoint\ntheory with its thesis that all knowledge is situated (to be discussed\nin\n section 4.3),\n but arguably all feminist epistemology calls for a recognition of the\nsituated nature of knowledge.\n\nSprague notes that qualitative methods are often thought to be better\nsuited to challenge inequalities that are apparent from \u201cthe\ndownside of the social hierarchies\u201d\u2014that is, from the\nlives of those who are the subjects of research (Sprague 2016: 140).\nDoing science as a feminist means paying attention to the way that\ngender structures the differential distribution of power in society\nand consequently access to the means of production of knowledge. We\nsee evidence of this in the invisibility of those who are\nmarginalized, the silencing of their voices, and the failure to\nacknowledge them as trustworthy epistemic agents\u2014all of which\nare varieties of epistemic injustice (see\n feminist social epistemology,\n also Fricker 2007; Dotson 2011; Medina 2013). While the feminist\ncommitments that Sprague details are consistent with the idea that\nfeminist researchers are not confined to any specific methods, to\nstart from the lives of women when those lives are not among those who\nare producing knowledge or being listened to in the production of\nknowledge means that researchers should be thinking about the extent\nto which their methods will allow lived experience to be recognized as\nevidence. Consequently, feminist methodology calls for methods to be\nchosen consciously\u2014that is, with awareness of their strengths\nand weakness in relation to the lives of those researched and\nresearcher\u2019s feminist commitments and goals. Feminist\nmethodology is thus self-reflective in the sense that appropriateness\nof methods should always be considered.\n\nIt is not surprising then that methodological debates coincided with\nmore women entering the social sciences and finding that the tools\nthat they had been trained to use were not always adequate. In\nsociology we see several examples of this. The feminist sociologist\nMargaret DeVault altered her interview transcription practices,\nrejecting the traditional practices she had been taught, when she came\nto believe that the hesitations\u2014the \u201cums\u201d, and\n\u201cyou knows\u201d in the responses of those she\ninterviewed\u2014were relevant as evidence. Traditionally these would\nhave been eliminated or smoothed out in a transcription but DeVault\nfound that they often marked topics that needed to be returned to and\nreflected emotional factors that were relevant to the research\nquestions she was investigating (DeVault 1999: 78). DeVault starts\nfrom the lives of the women she studies as standpoint methodology\nurges, and in doing so she is attentive to the emotional valences of\ntheir lives (see\n section 4.3\n on standpoint theory). She chooses and adjust her methods in response\nto this guiding methodology.\n\nSociologists Dorothy Smith and Patricia Hill Collins also advocate\nstandpoint methodology. Smith notes the mismatch between the lived\nexperience of those who are researched and the concepts and methods\nsociology prescribes. She refers to this tension as producing\n\u201clines of fault\u201d and urges critical feminist sociologists\nto rethink practices in order to better capture experience. Smith\ndescribes this as problematizing everyday life, with the result that\nwhat was taken to be \u201cnatural\u201d is reassessed and\nreinterpreted (Smith 1987). Using a similar approach\u2014starting\nfrom the lives of women in the African American communities she\nstudies\u2014Collins finds that neither mainstream sociological\naccounts nor standard (white) feminist approaches fit the experiences\nof the women she studies\u2014nor should they all be thought of as\nall having the same experiences (Collins 1990 [2000/2009]). Thus the\nself-reflective nature of feminist methodology directs the researcher\nto question tools (methods), assumptions about how to support\nknowledge (epistemology), and standard assumptions about the nature\nof the objects of inquiry (ontology).\n\nMethods are not neutral. They carry with them assumptions about what\nit is to produce knowledge (epistemology) and the world that they are\nused to explore (ontology). If those assumptions are flawed or not\nadequate to research goals then they can result in a failure to take\nappropriate evidence into consideration, distorting both the results\nand interpretations of research. When researchers avail themselves of\na plurality of methods, they are more likely to think through the\nbenefits and drawbacks of the various techniques and reflect on their assumptions.\n\nMethods may also carry value commitments\u2014another reason for\nreflecting on their use. Quantitative methods in the social sciences\nare aimed at providing information about average effects in large\npopulations. When evidence is constrained by an epistemological\ncommitment to a method that only allows for evidence of average\neffects, then the method itself may result in treating characteristics\nof particular individuals as irrelevant. The methods force the\ndisappearance of differences which may be relevant with the result\nthat they may de-value minority populations or individuals. Methods\nthat produce evidence of average effects threaten to have a\ndisproportionate impact on those who are who are not\n\u201caverage\u201d in the requisite sense.\n\nThe adept use of quantitative methods may ameliorate these worries to\nsome extent. If populations are recognized as heterogeneous then\nresearchers might engage in further research on subpopulations. Some\naspects of the problem of erasure of difference could be addressed,\nbut which characteristics indicate relevant subpopulations will\nrequire attention to the lived experience of those who are studied.\nThe need to identify relevant subpopulations reinforces a need for\npluralism regarding methods, since recognition of relevant difference\ndepends on the sort of scrutiny most frequently provided through\nqualitative methods. Recent feminist attention to intersectionality\nand the ways power differentially structures society through gender,\nrace, ability, sexuality, socioeconomic class, ethnicity, and other\nsalient features of individuals raises a further worry. It is not\nentirely clear how a subpopulation strategy can address social justice\nissues intertwined in this way. There is some recent research that\nattempts to address intersectionality. Bright, Malinsky, and Thompson\n(2016) offer one approach to examining intersectional causality, for\nexample. But intersectional effects cannot be understood as\nadditive\u2014once again counting against reliance on exclusively\nquantitative approaches. Finally, there is the problem that further\npartitioning of the reference class may also decrease the sample size\nand thus undermine the power of the method. In any case, these worries\nfurther support the feminist intuition that methods must be chosen\nconsciously and with attention to the aims of research.\n\nIn summary, feminist methods sometimes reveal that standard\ndisciplinary conceptions of the objects of inquiry do not get at what\nis significant relative to feminist research questions. Furthermore,\nsome methods are suitable for studying large populations but not for\nrevealing what we may need to know about individuals or smaller\npopulations. (Longino makes this point as well in another context in\nPart 2 of Longino 2013.) Finally, what theory of evidence we\nhave\u2014how we understand scientific knowledge to be\njustified\u2014matters to how we understand the way gender matters to\nknowledge production. Thus we turn to feminist epistemology in the\ncontext of philosophy of science.\n",
