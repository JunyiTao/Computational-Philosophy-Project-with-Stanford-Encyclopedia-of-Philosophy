Applied Questions in Immigration\n\n\nAs the preceding discussion shows, there are a variety of promising\narguments in favor of a state\u2019s right to control immigration and many\nstrong considerations which suggest that countries are obligated to\nmaintain open borders. While some arguments are more popular than\nothers, critical questions can be raised about each of them.  Rather\nthan try to decisively defend either side here, let us conclude by\nbriefly surveying some of the more engaging applied issues related to\nthe morality of immigration. These include the definition and moral\nclaims of refugees, the conditions under which one may hire guest\nworkers, the permissibility of recruiting skilled professionals from\npoor countries where individuals with these talents are already in\nshort supply, the rights of irregular migrants, and what kinds of\nselection criteria a country may use to distinguish among applicants\nfor immigration\n",
