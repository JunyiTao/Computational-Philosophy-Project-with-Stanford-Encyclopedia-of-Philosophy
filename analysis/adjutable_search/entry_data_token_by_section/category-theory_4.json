    "main_text": "Brief Historical Sketch\n3. Philosophical Significance\n\n\nCategory theory challenges philosophers in two ways, which are not\nnecessarily mutually exclusive. On the one hand, it is certainly the\ntask of philosophy to clarify the general epistemological and\nontological status of categories and categorical methods, both in the\npractice of mathematics and in the foundational landscape. On the\nother hand, philosophers and philosophical logicians can employ\ncategory theory and categorical logic to explore philosophical and\nlogical problems. I now discuss these challenges, briefly, in turn.\n\n\nCategory theory is now a common tool in the mathematician\u2019s\ntoolbox; that much is clear. It is also clear that category theory\norganizes and unifies much of mathematics. Contemporary mathematical\nfields would not be what they are without category theory, for\ninstance algebraic topology, homological algebra, homotopy theory and\nhomotopical algebra, representation theory, arithmetic geometry and\nalgebraic geometry. (See for instance Mac\u2009Lane 1971, 1998 or\nPedicchio & Tholen 2004.) No one will deny these simple facts.\nFurthermore, vast portions of contemporary mathematics now rest on a\ndifferent practice which rely, in large part, on the manipulation of\nnew graphical notations, on the one hand, and on different levels of\nabstraction, on the other hand. It is not simply that category theory\nand the mathematical disciplines developed within that framework use\ncommutative diagrams, although this in itself leads to some\ninteresting philosophical explorations, as for instance in De Toffoli\n2017, but category theorists have seen the need to develop systematic\nand formal graphical languages to express directly various forms of\nargumentations. (See, for instance, Joyal & Street 1993; Joyal,\nStreet & Verity 1996; Fong & Spivak 2019, Other Internet\nResources.) Whereas since\nBourbaki, mathematics was done \u201cup to isomorphism\u201d, in\nsome cases, it is now done \u201cup to equivalence\u201d or up to\n\u201cbi-equivalence\u201d or even up to\n\u201cn-equivalence\u201d. (For an attempt at clarifying what these\nlevels of abstraction mean, see Marquis 2014, Marquis 2016.)\n\n\nDoing mathematics in a categorical framework is almost always\nradically different from doing it in a set-theoretical framework (the\nexception being working with the internal language of a Boolean topos;\nwhenever the topos is not Boolean, then the main difference lies in\nthe fact that the logic is intuitionistic). Hence, as is\noften the case when a different conceptual framework is adopted, many\nbasic issues regarding the nature of the objects studied, the nature\nof the knowledge involved, and the nature of the methods used have to\nbe reevaluated. We will take up these three aspects in turn.\n\n\nTwo facets of the nature of mathematical objects within a categorical\nframework have to be emphasized. First, objects are always given in a\ncategory. An object exists in and depends upon an ambient\ncategory. Furthermore, an object is characterized by the morphisms\ngoing in it and/or the morphisms coming out of it. Second, objects are\nalways characterized up to isomorphism (in the best cases, up to a\nunique isomorphism). There is no such thing, for instance, as\nthe natural numbers. However, it can be argued that there is\nsuch a thing as the concept of natural numbers. Indeed, the\nconcept of natural numbers can be given unambiguously, via the\nDedekind-Peano-Lawvere axioms, but what this concept refers to in\nspecific cases depends on the context in which it is interpreted,\ne.g., the category of sets or a topos of sheaves over a topological\nspace. Thus, it seems that sense does not determine reference in a\ncategorical context. It is hard to resist the temptation to think that\ncategory theory embodies a form of structuralism, that it describes\nmathematical objects as structures since the latter, presumably, are\nalways characterized up to isomorphism. Thus, the key here has to do\nwith the kind of criterion of identity at work within a categorical\nframework and how it resembles any criterion given for objects which\nare thought of as forms in general. One of the standard objections\npresented against this view is that if objects are thought of as\nstructures and only as abstract structures, meaning here that\nthey are separated from any specific or concrete representation, then\nit is impossible to locate them within the mathematical universe. (See\nHellman 2003 for a standard formulation of the objection, McLarty\n1993, Awodey 2004, Landry & Marquis 2005, Shapiro 2005, Landry\n2011, Linnebo & Pettigrew 2011, Hellman 2011, Shapiro 2011,\nMcLarty 2011, Logan 2015 for relevant material on the issue.)\n\n\nA slightly different way to make\nsense of the situation is to think of mathematical objects as\ntypes for which there are tokens given in different\ncontexts. This is strikingly different from the situation one finds in\nset theory, in which mathematical objects are defined uniquely and\ntheir reference is given directly. Although one can make room for\ntypes within set theory via equivalence classes or isomorphism types\nin general, the basic criterion of identity within that\nframework is given by the axiom of extensionality and thus,\nultimately, reference is made to specific sets. Furthermore, it can\nbe argued that the relation between a type and its token is\nnot represented adequately by the membership relation. A\ntoken does not belong to a type, it is not an element of a type, but\nrather it is an instance of it. In a categorical framework, one always\nrefers to a token of a type, and what the theory\ncharacterizes directly is the type, not the tokens. In this framework,\none does not have to locate a type, but tokens of it are, at least in\nmathematics, epistemologically required. This is simply the reflection\nof the interaction between the abstract and the concrete in the\nepistemological sense (and not the ontological sense of these latter\nexpressions.) (See Ellerman 1988, Ellerman 2017, Marquis 2000, Marquis\n2006, Marquis 2013.)\n\n\nThe history of category theory offers a rich source of information to\nexplore and take into account for an historically sensitive\nepistemology of mathematics. It is hard to imagine, for instance, how\nalgebraic geometry and algebraic topology could have become what they\nare now without categorical tools. (See, for instance, Carter 2008,\nCorfield 2003, Kr\u00f6mer 2007, Marquis 2009, McLarty 1994, McLarty\n2006.) Category theory has lead to reconceptualizations of various\nareas of mathematics based on purely abstract foundations. Moreover,\nwhen developed in a categorical framework, traditional boundaries\nbetween disciplines are shattered and reconfigured; to mention but one\nimportant example, topos theory provides a direct bridge between\nalgebraic geometry and logic, to the point where certain results in\nalgebraic geometry are directly translated into logic and vice versa.\nCertain concepts that were geometrical in origin are more clearly seen\nas logical (for example, the notion of coherent topos). Algebraic\ntopology also lurks in the background. (See, for instance, Caramello\n2018 for a systematic exploitation of the idea of toposes as bridges\nin mathematics.) On a different but important front, it can be argued\nthat the distinction between mathematics and metamathematics cannot be\narticulated in the way it has been. All these issues have to be\nreconsidered and reevaluated.\n\n\nMoving closer to mathematical practice, category theory allowed for\nthe development of methods that have changed and continue to change\nthe face of mathematics. It could be argued that category theory\nrepresents the culmination of one of deepest and most powerful\ntendencies in twentieth century mathematical thought: the search for\nthe most general and abstract ingredients in a given\nsituation. Category theory is, in this sense, the legitimate heir of\nthe Dedekind-Hilbert-Noether-Bourbaki tradition, with its emphasis on\nthe axiomatic method and algebraic structures. (For a different\nreading, see Rodin 2014.) When used to characterize a specific\nmathematical domain, category theory reveals the frame upon which that\narea is built, the overall structure presiding to its stability,\nstrength and coherence. The structure of this specific area, in a\nsense, might not need to rest on anything, that is, on some solid\nsoil, for it might very well be just one part of a larger network that\nis without any Archimedean point, as if floating in space. To use a\nwell-known metaphor: from a categorical point of view, Neurath\u2019s\nship has become a spaceship.\n\n\nStill, it remains to be seen whether category theory should be \u201con the\nsame plane,\u201d so to speak, as set theory, whether it should be taken as\na serious alternative to set theory as a foundation for mathematics,\nor whether it is foundational in a different sense altogether. (That\nthis very question applies even more forcefully to topos theory will\nnot detain us.)\n\n\nLawvere from early on promoted the idea that a category of categories\ncould be used as a foundational framework. (See Lawvere 1964, 1966.)\nThis proposal now rests in part on the development of\nhigher-dimensional categories, also called weak \\(n\\)-categories.\n(See, for instance Makkai 1998.) The advent of topos theory in the\nseventies brought new possibilities. Mac\u2009Lane has suggested\nthat certain toposes be considered as a genuine foundation for\nmathematics. (See Mac\u2009Lane 1986.) Lambek proposed the so-called\nfree topos as the best possible framework, in the sense that\nmathematicians with different philosophical outlooks might nonetheless\nagree to adopt it. (See Couture & Lambek 1991, 1992, Lambek\n1994.) He has also argued that there is no topos that can\nthoroughly satisfy a classical mathematician. (See Lambek 2004.) (For\nmore on the various foundational views among category theorists, see\nLandry & Marquis 2005.)\n\n\nArguments have been advanced for and against category theory as a\nfoundational framework. (Blass 1984 surveys the relationships between\ncategory theory and set theory. Feferman 1977, Bell 1981, and Hellman\n2003 argue against category theory. See Marquis 1995 for a quick\noverview and proposal and McLarty 2004 and Awodey 2004 for replies to\nHellman 2003.) The debate has advanced slowly but surely. It has been\nrecognized that it is possible to present a foundational framework in\nthe language of category theory, be it in the form of the Elementary\nTheory of the Category of Sets, ETCS, or a category of categories, of\nMakkai Structuralist foundations for abstract mathematics, SFAM. Thus,\nit seems that the community no longer question the logical and the\nconceptual autonomy of these approaches, to use the terminology\nintroduced by Linnebo & Pettigrew 2011. The main issue seems to be\nwhether one can provide a philosophically satisfying justification for\none of those framework. (See Hellman 2013, Landry 2013, Marquis 2013b,\nMcLarty 2018.)\n\n\nThis matter is further complicated by the fact that the foundations of\ncategory theory itself have yet to be clarified. For there may be many\ndifferent ways to think of a universe of higher-dimensional categories\nas a foundations for mathematics. It is safe to say that we now have a\ngood understanding of what are called \\((\\infty, 1)\\)-categories and important\nmathematical results have been obtained in that framework. (See, for\ninstance, Cisinski 2019 for a presentation.) An adequate language for\nthe universe of arbitrary higher-dimensional categories still has to\nbe presented together with definite axioms for mathematics. (See\nMakkai 1998 for a short description of such a language. A different\napproach based on homotopy theory but with closed connections with\nhigher-dimensional categories has been proposed by Voevodsky et\nal. and is being vigorously pursued. See the book Homotopy Type\nTheory, by Awodey et al. 2013.) \n\n\nIt is an established fact that category theory is employed to study\nlogic and philosophy. Indeed, categorical logic, the study of logic by\ncategorical means, has been under way for about 40 years now and still\nvigorous. Some of the philosophically relevant results obtained in\ncategorical logic are:\n\nThe hierarchy of categorical doctrines: regular categories,\ncoherent categories, Heyting categories and Boolean categories; all\nthese correspond to well-defined logical systems, together with\ndeductive systems and completeness theorems; they suggest that logical\nnotions, including quantifiers, arise naturally in a specific order\nand are not haphazardly organized (see Walsh 2017 for a philosophical\njustification of logical connectives using category theory and\nHalvorson & Tsementzis 2018 for a look from the point of view of\nscientific theories);\nJoyal\u2019s generalization of Kripke-Beth semantics for intuitionistic\nlogic to sheaf semantics (Lambek & Scott 1986, Mac\u2009Lane\n& Moerdijk 1992);\nCoherent and geometric logic, so-called, whose practical and\nconceptual significance has yet to be explored (Makkai & Reyes\n1977, Mac\u2009Lane & Moerdiejk 1992, Johnstone 2002, Caramello\n2011b, 2012a);\nThe notions of generic model and classifying topos of a theory\n(Makkai & Reyes 1977, Boileau & Joyal 1981, Bell 1988, Mac Lane\n& Moerdijk 1992, Johnstone 2002, Caramello 2012b);\nThe notion of strong conceptual completeness and the associated\ntheorems (Makkai & Reyes 1977, Butz & Moerdijk 1999, Makkai\n1981, Pitts 1989, Johnstone 2002);\nGeometric proofs of the independence of the continuum hypothesis\nand other strong axioms of set theory (Tierney 1972, Bunge 1974, Freyd\n1980, 1987, Blass & Scedrov 1983, 1989, 1992, Mac\u2009Lane &\nMoerdijk 1992);\nModels and development of constructive mathematics (see\nbibliography below);\nSynthetic differential geometry, an alternative to standard and\nnon-standard analysis (Kock 1981, Bell 1998, 2001, 2006);\nThe construction of the so-called effective topos, in which every\nfunction on the natural numbers is recursive (McLarty 1992,\nHyland 1982, 1991, Van Oosten 2002, Van Oosten 2008);\nCategorical models of linear logic, modal logic, fuzzy sets, and\ngeneral higher-order type theories (Reyes 1991, Reyes & Zawadoski\n1993, Reyes & Zolfaghari 1991, 1996, Makkai & Reyes 1995,\nGhilardi & Zawadowski 2002, Rodabaugh & Klement 2003, Jacobs\n1999, Taylor 1999, Johnstone 2002, Blute & Scott 2004, Awodey\n& Warren 2009, Awodey et al. 2013, Kishida 2018, Cockett &Seely 2018);\nA graphical syntax called \u201csketches\u201d (Barr & Wells\n1985, 1999, Makkai 1997a, 1997b, 1997c, Johnstone 2002).\nQuantum logic, the foundations of quantum physics and quantum\nfield theory (Brunetti et al. 2003, Abramsky & Duncan 2006, Heunen et al. 2009, Baez\n& Stay 2010, Baez & Lauda 2011, Coecke 2011, Isham 2011,\nD\u00f6ring 2011, Eva 2017, Coecke & Kissinger 2018).\n\n\n\nCategorical tools in logic offer considerable flexibility, as is\nillustrated by the fact that almost all the surprising results of\nconstructive and intuitionistic mathematics can be modeled in a proper\ncategorical setting. At the same time, the standard set-theoretic\nnotions, e.g. Tarski\u2019s semantics, have found natural generalizations\nin categories. Thus, categorical logic has roots in logic as it was\ndeveloped in the twentieth century, while at the same time providing a\npowerful and novel framework with numerous links to other parts of\nmathematics.\n\n\nCategory theory also bears on more general philosophical questions.\nFrom the foregoing disussion, it should be obvious that category\ntheory and categorical logic ought to have an impact on almost all\nissues arising in philosophy of logic: from the nature of identity\ncriteria to the question of alternative logics, category theory always\nsheds a new light on these topics. Similar remarks can be made when we\nturn to ontology, in particular formal ontology: the part/whole\nrelation, boundaries of systems, ideas of space, etc. Ellerman (1988)\nhas bravely attempted to show that category theory constitutes a\ntheory of universals, one having properties radically different from\nset theory, which is also seen as a theory of universals. Moving from\nontology to cognitive science, MacNamara & Reyes (1994) have tried\nto employ categorical logic to provide a different logic of\nreference. In particular, they have attempted to clarify the\nrelationships between count nouns and mass terms. Other researchers\nare using category theory to study complex systems, cognitive neural\nnetworks, and analogies. (See, for instance, Ehresmann 2018, Ehresmann &\nVanbremeersch 1987, 2007, Healy 2000, Healy & Caudell 2006,\nArzi-Gonczarowski 1999, Brown & Porter 2006.) Finally,\nphilosophers of science have turned to category theory to shed a new\nlight on issues related to structuralism in science. (See, for\ninstance, Brading & Landry 2006, Bain 2013, Lam & W\u00fcthrich\n2015, Eva 2016, Lal & Teh 2017, Landry 2007, 2012, 2018.)\n\n\nCategory theory offers thus many philosophical challenges, challenges\nwhich will hopefully be taken up in years to come.\n",
