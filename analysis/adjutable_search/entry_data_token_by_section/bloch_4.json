In this, the critical and normative function of utopia\nplays a major role (Levitas 1990; Moir 2019b): humans are defined as\ninherently utopian beings (GA 13: 239); the world is\namenable to change through human praxis; and the subjective\nutopian drive paired with objective tendencies condition this\nprocessual vision. In fact, Bloch\u2019s whole philosophy is the\ninvestigation into various forms of practical intentionality\u2014or,\nas Habermas (1969/1970) puts it, the way to redress Schellingian idea\nof potencies in a Marxist interpretation: in Bloch, a working\nsocialized human being realizing these potencies comes central stage.\nBloch\u2019s ontological emphasis on natura naturans is\nparalleled by the centrality of the productive force in the ontology\nof society (Bloch 2000a). It is this historical intersubjective\ndimension, always accompanying existential experience and prompting it\nto active transformation of its world, that, Bloch believes, makes his\nphilosophy so different from Heidegger\u2019s. Even his early\nspiritualist attempts focusing on subjectivity are always accompanied\nby the dialectical complement of worldly realization. Bloch\u2019s\nmysticism\u2014as well as his ontology\u2014was thus always\npolitical, it is used to stage the existential presence of the\nforthcoming freedom.\n\nThe world Bloch wants to liberate is the world of capitalist\nestrangement, which, in his Marxist phase, is also described as a\nmeaningless \u201chollow space\u201d. In it, the conflicts are due\nto the inherently unjust, class based social structure and private\nproperty. In the classless kingdom of the future, based on\n\u201cmorals without property\u201d (GA 15: 188), neither nature nor\ntechnology will be alienated from or alienating for humans (Bloch also\nexplores an emancipatory potential in technological utopias). The\nprevailing attitude would then be that of affectedness\n(Betroffenheit) (GA 9: 56).\n\nBloch\u2019s commitment to Marxism is visible already in his early\nwork (it is present in The Spirit of Utopia), but was never\northodox. The urge to emancipation, the critical perspective on the\nhuman social praxis, and the focus on the laboring individual as the\nmajor motor of history were the elements of Marxist doctrine Bloch was\nmostly keen to adopt. Indeed, only after Marx, Bloch believed, utopia\nbecame \u201cconcrete\u201d. Bloch\u2019s major theoretical\nproposal was to complement what he termed \u201ccold stream\u201d in\nMarxism (analysis of objective social conditions) with the \u201cwarm\nstream\u201d of utopian \u201csurplus\u201d. Bloch was thus\ncriticizing the lack of a normative and imaginative dimension in\nMarxist philosophy. His ultimate aim was not to find its way into\nMarxism, but rather to locate, in an Hegelian fashion, Marxist ideas\nin a broader realm of utopian thought.\n",
