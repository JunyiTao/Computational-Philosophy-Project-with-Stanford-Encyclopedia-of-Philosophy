    "main_text": "\n\nFor a number of years in the mid-nineteenth century, Ludwig Feuerbach\n(1804\u20131872) played a pivotal role in the history of\npost-Hegelian German philosophy, and in the emergence of various forms\nof naturalism, materialism, and positivism that is one of the most\ncharacteristic developments of this period (cf. Mandelbaum 1971:\n3\u201337 and Arndt & Jaeschke 2000). As a public intellectual in\nGermany during the decade that culminated in the revolutionary\nuprising of 1848, Feuerbach embodied many of the democratic and\nprogressive aspirations that were frustrated by its eventual failure.\nThereafter, during a decade of political reaction, he was an\ninspiration to such populizers of scientific materialism as Carl Vogt,\nJacob Moleschott, and Ludwig B\u00fcchner, whose role in the\nsecularization of modern culture in the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury was considerable (cf. Gregory 1977). By virtue of the enduring\ninfluence of his most famous book, The Essence of\nChristianity, which was translated into English by George Eliot,\nFeuerbach has continued, since the beginning of the twentieth century,\nto attract the interest of theologians. The theological reception of\nFeuerbach has been shaped to a considerable extent by the disputed\ncontention first expressed in the 1920s by the Neo-Orthodox\ntheologian, Karl Barth, that Feuerbach\u2019s atheistic account of\nChristianity only brought to their most logically consistent\nconclusion the foundational premises of the liberal Protestant\ntheological enterprise inaugurated by Friedrich Schleiermacher at the\noutset of the nineteenth century. This enterprise, which Barth and a\nnumber of his contemporaries sought to repudiate, had, in the wake of\nHume and Kant, shifted the starting point of theological reflection\nfrom divine revelation and metaphysics to human religious experience.\nIn the field of religious studies (as distinct from theology),\nFeuerbach is often considered to have produced a classical\n\u201cprojection\u201d theory of religion. Such theories seek to\nidentify the underlying psychological and cognitive mechanisms that\ngive rise to, and explain the persistence of, various religious\nbeliefs and\n behaviors.[1]\n\n\nTo the extent that Feuerbach is remembered today outside the context\nof theology and religious studies, it is mainly as the object of Karl\nMarx\u2019s criticism in his famous Theses on Feuerbach,\noriginally penned in 1845, but first published posthumously by\nFriedrich Engels as an appendix to his book, Ludwig Feuerbach and\nthe End of Classical German Philosophy (Engels 1888). These\ntheses are often thought to represent the first cursory articulation\nof the theory that subsequently came to be known as historical\nmaterialism. This theory began to be spelled out in more detail by\nMarx and Engels in The German Ideology, a lengthy work in\nwhich they sought to distance themselves from their erstwhile Young\nHegelian compatriots. Renewed philosophical attention paid to\nFeuerbach in the middle of the twentieth century is largely\nattributable to the publication for the first time, beginning in the\nlate 1920s, of Marx\u2019s early philosophical manuscripts, including\nThe German Ideology, which revealed the extent of\nFeuerbach\u2019s influence on Marx and Engels during the period\nculminating in its composition\n (1845\u201346).[2]\n In 1870, two years prior to his death, after having studied the first\nvolume of Marx\u2019s Capital (1867), Feuerbach became a\nmember of the Social Democratic Party, some financial support from\nwhich helped him to survive the penury to which he and his family were\nsubjected toward the end of his life. Feuerbach\u2019s funeral\nprocession in Nuremberg is said to have been attended by crowds waving\nred banners, the symbol of the worker\u2019s movement. Nevertheless,\nFeuerbach\u2019s direct public influence and popularity as a\nphilosophical writer declined rapidly in the 1850s in approximately\ninverse proportion to the rising, albeit belated, influence of\nSchopenhauer, whose spirit of pessimistic resignation was perhaps more\nin tune with the prevailing historical reality.\n\nApart from the influences outlined above, Feuerbach\u2019s importance\nfor the history of modern philosophy is due to the fact that the\npublication of The Essence of Christianity in 1841 can be\ntaken, as it was by Engels, to symbolically mark the end of the period\nof classical German philosophy that had begun sixty years earlier with\nthe appearance of Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure\nReason\u2014though some might want to question the assumption\ninvolved in this way of putting things that classical German\nphilosophy culminated in the Hegelian system that Engels thought of\nFeuerbach as having\n overthrown.[3]\n In any case, Feuerbach\u2019s intellectual biography; his initially\ndeep investment in, and subsequent effort to distance himself from,\nthe Hegelian cause; and his attempt to inaugurate a new, sensualistic\n\u201cphilosophy of the future,\u201d are all closely intertwined\nwith political and intellectual developments in Germany during this\n period.[4]\n Although Feuerbach ultimately failed to adequately develop the\naphoristically formulated \u201cprinciples\u201d of the new\nphilosophy that he set out in 1843, the emphases in his later essays\non corporeality, the senses, finitude, inter-subjectivity, and drive\npsychology nevertheless succeeded in introducing into the history of\nmodern European thought themes developed further by Marx, Friedrich\nNietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Max Scheler, Martin Buber, Karl L\u00f6with,\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty and Alfred Schmidt, among\n others.[5]\n\n",
