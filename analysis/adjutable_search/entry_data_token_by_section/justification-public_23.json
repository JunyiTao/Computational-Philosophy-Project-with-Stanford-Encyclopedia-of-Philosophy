    "main_text": "Objections || The Empty Set Objection\n6.9 The Empty Set Objection\n\nThe most powerful objection to the PJP is that it allows too many\nreasons to defeat proposed laws. The objection applies to various\ninterpretations of the PJP. But critics direct it most often at the\nconvergence views. (Eberle 2012; Enoch 2015, though see Schultz-Bergin\n2021) By allowing diverse defeaters into public justification, few\nproposals reach public justification. Few states can engage in their\nmost basic functions. Some public reason liberals admit that public\njustification is often beyond us. (Rawls 2005, D\u2019Agostino 2006).\nWe may need some degree of social development to establish a publicly\njustified polity. (Rawls 2005).\n\nGaus offers the most prominent response. The benefits of shared norms\ncan populate an otherwise empty set of proposals. The idea here is\nthat we all rank some rules ahead of no rule governing some issue.\nWhile we regard some rules as sub-optimal, they improve our relations\nwith others. This reply is a sociological response: people prefer\nsub-optimal ethical rules to no rules because empty sets are\ndebilitating. Both Rawls and Gaus provide such arguments. (Rawls 2002,\n124\u2013128, Gaus 2011, 303\u2013333, 389\u2013408,\n424\u2013447).\n\nIn short, each person may have a defeater for another\u2019s\npreferred moral rule. But most members of the public prefer some\nethical governance to none, and in that case, they may deem some moral\nrules acceptable but not optimal.\n6.10 The Insincerity Objection\n\nThis objection threatens convergence views. Quong thinks permitting\npersonal reasons allows citizens to be insincere with one another.\nConvergence citizens can offer others reasons they do not believe are\ngood reasons. (Quong 2011). This objection does not address the\ndistinction between shared reasons and standards. We are not insincere\nif we offer others reasons that follow our modes of inquiry but end up\nin a different place. If we share a scientific method, yet end up with\ndifferent theories, we may have varied reasons. But sharing diverse\nreasons is not insincere when our shared background is common\nknowledge.\n\nQuong\u2019s consensus constraints also appear to bar reasoning by\nconjecture. (Rawls 2002, Schwartzman 2012). Conjectural reasoning\nallows persons to appeal to the reasons of other comprehensive\ndoctrines. But both parties are aware of the nature of such appeals.\nThat said, sincerity requirements may still have an essential role in\npublic reason. (Schwartzman 2011)\n6.11 Theoretical Indeterminacy\n\nFred D\u2019Agostino (1996) argues that the PJP admits many variants.\n(We characterize the variants through values in the PJP.) We have\nreasons to favor a range of interpretations of the PJP. For example,\npublic justification appeals to idealization. But we have grounds to\nidealize radically, moderately, or not at all. (Macedo 1990 makes\nthese points.) Unfortunately, the case for idealizing, but not\nidealizing too much, is complicated and involves conflicting\ndesiderata. True, conflicting desiderata are common in any theoretical\ndomain. Still, D\u2019Agostino worries that conceptions of public\njustification arise from incompatible motivations, and theorists lack\nconceptual resources to weigh these considerations against one\nanother. In his final book, Gaus (2021) argues that even his earlier\nevolutionary model of public reason (Gaus 2011) would not lead to\nconvergence on rules in many cases; but with diverse agents in a free\nand interactive model of rule choice can converge on rules more\noften.\n6.12 Concerns about Idealization\n\nPublic reason liberals, again, feel intense pressure to idealize. But\nsome critics think idealization is always arbitrary.\n\nEberle (2002) claims idealizations reflect the biases and values of\ntheorists, which is why largely secular public reason liberals\nsuppress religious reasons. So, any version of the PJP that appeals to\nidealization is subject to this objection.\n\nDavid Enoch (2013) rejects Gaus\u2019s moderate idealization. Contra\nGaus, such idealization does not show that social-moral rules reduce\nauthoritarianism. Nicholas Wolterstorff (2007) argues that coercing\nsomeone based on an idealization is patronizing. Even disrespectful.\nFor recent papers on idealization, see Besch 2019, Donahue 2021,\nVallier 2020b.\n\nIn light of these objections, Fabian Wendt (2019) has tried to\nseparate public justification from public reason liberals. He hopes to\ncapture what is attractive about public justification while separating\nit from problems with public reason in liberal political thought.\n6.13 New Objections to Convergence\n\nIn recent years, consensus theorists have pushed back against\nconvergence views in detail. While these arguments are all unique,\nthey are worth noting as a general phenomenon. See Badano and Bonotti\n2020, Boettcher 2020, Tahzib 2021, Neufeld 2022. But the debate rages\non from convergence theorists; see Motchoulski 2020.\n7. Applied Issues\n\nTheorists often use public justification to address important applied\nquestions. Applied questions concern religion in liberal democracies,\nreligious exemptions, feminism, marriage policy, environmental issues,\nhealthy eating policies, and even public reason and Confucianism.\nApplied issues are the order of the day in much of the literature.\n\nOn the religion in politics literature, see the entry on\n religion and political theory.\n Also, see literature reviews in March 2013, Vallier 2014, and Bailey\nand Gentile 2014. While many public reason liberals have moved away\nfrom a restraint-based approach to religion in public life (Gaus and\nVallier 2009, Laborde 2017, newer work defends such principles (Watson\nand Hartley 2018). Some even focus public reason on discourse, setting\npublic justification aside (Leland 2019). Still other theorists have\nfocused on developing principles of restraint appropriate for managing\npartisanship and the conduct of political parties (Bonotti 2017).\n\nWe have seen the rapid expansion of the literature on public reason\nand religious exemptions, brought into clear focus in Cecile\nLaborde\u2019s (2017) work. (Also see Bespalov 2019.) Some of the\nexemption literature extends into medical exemptions. See McConnell\nand Card 2019.\n\nPublic reason and feminism discussions are now voluminous. (Okin 1994,\nRawls 2002, Nussbaum 2003, Baehr 2008, Hartley and Watson 2009,\nHartley and Watson 2010, Neufeld and Van Schoelandt 2014, and Watson\nand Hartley 2018).\n\nTo explore public justification and marriage policy, see Brake 2010,\nMacedo 2015, Chambers 2017, and Toop 2019.\n\nPublic reason methods have also been applied to environmental issues\n(Shahar forthcoming; Nielsen and Hauge-Helgestad 2021), as well as\nhealthy eating policy (Bonotti and Barnhill 2019).\n\nWe are also seeing the beginnings of a discussion about the\nintersection of public reason and the Confucian religion (Kim 2019;\nD\u2019Ambrosio 2019).\n\nWe have also seen the introduction of new formal methods into public\nreason, such as social choice theory (Kogelmann 2017, 2019; Chung\n2020), agent-based modeling (Muldoon 2019, Gaus 2021), and fixed-point\ntheorems (Schaefer 2022).",
