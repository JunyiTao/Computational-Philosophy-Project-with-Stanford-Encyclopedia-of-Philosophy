    "main_text": "Some Historical Episodes || Locke, Hume and Reid\n2.2 Locke, Hume and Reid\n\nIf the nineteenth century saw a surge in interest in\ntime-consciousness due to discoveries in a range of different\nfields\u2014see Canales (2009) for more of the story\u2014an\ninterest in these questions dates back far earlier. Saint\nAugustine\u2019s labours in Book XI of the Confessions led\nhim to espouse a position that is at least highly suggestive of a\nversion of the cinematic conception outlined in\n \u00a71.\n Augustine subscribed to the doctrine of presentism (as it\nhas latterly become known), i.e., he held that only what is present is\nreal:\n\n\nWhat now is clear and plain is, that neither things to come nor past\nare. Nor is it properly said, \u201cthere be three times, past\npresent and to come:\u201d yet perchance it might be properly said,\n\u201cthere be three times: a present of things past, a present of\nthings present, and a present of things future\u201d. For these three\ndo exist in some sort, in the soul, but otherwhere do I not see them;\npresent of things past, memory; present of things present, sight;\npresent of things future, expectation. (Confessions, bk XI,\nch XX, sect 26)\n\n\nSince for Augustine it was also clear that the present must be\nentirely without duration, and that our perception is restricted to\nwhat is present\u2014\u201cthat only can be seen, which is\u201d\n(bk XI, ch XVIII, sect 24)\u2014we are led swiftly to the conclusion\nthat we can perceive or experience only what is contained in a\nmomentary present.\n\nSince we evidently possess concepts of persistence,\nsuccession and suchlike, one would expect philosophers who believe\nthat our basic concepts derive their content from the content of our\nimmediate experience\u2014philosophers such as Locke and\nHume\u2014would incline in the direction of\n realism.[10]\n And generally speaking, albeit with certain complications, this is\nwhat we find. In the Essay (1689) Locke writes:\n\n\nIt is evident to anyone who will but observe what passes in his own\nmind, that there is a train of ideas which constantly succeed one\nanother in his understanding, as long as he is awake. Reflection on\nthese appearances of several ideas one after another in our minds, is\nthat which furnishes us with the idea of succession: and the distance\nbetween any parts of that succession, or between the appearance of any\ntwo ideas in our minds, is what we call duration. (Chapter XIV, 3)\n\n\nLike Locke, Hume believed that our conception of time is derived from\nour experience of the succession of our perceptions. In Book 1, Part\nII(\u00a73) of his Treatise (1739) Hume writes:\n\n\n\u2026 time cannot make its appearance to the mind, either alone, or\nattended with a steady unchangeable object, but is always discovered\nby some perceivable succession of changeable objects.\n(Treatise bk 1, pt 2, \u00a73 [1888: 35])\n\n\u2026 Five notes played on a flute give us the impression and idea\nof time; though time be not a sixth impression, which presents itself\nto the hearing or any other of the senses. [the mind] only takes\nnotice of the manner, in which the different sounds make the\nappearance \u2026 ([1888: 36])\n\n\u2026 the indivisible moments of time must be filled with some real\nobject or existence, whose succession forms the duration, and makes it\nconceivable by the mind. ([1888: 39])\n\n\nAlthough Hume agrees with Locke over the origin of our concept of\nsuccession, what he says about duration sits uneasily with\nLocke\u2019s contention that we arrive at the latter concept by\nobserving the distances between impressions. For Hume\n\n\nthe idea of duration is always derived from a succession of changeable\nobjects, and can never be conveyed to the mind by any thing steadfast\nand unchangeable. ([1888: 37])\n\n\nSince a period of (total) silence between the hearing of two sounds\nwould not itself contain any change or succession\u2014at least of an\nauditory kind\u2014the concept of duration cannot be derived from\nthis period of silence.\n\nFor Hume the fundamental ingredients of our streams of consciousness\nare momentary (durationless) experiences occupying \u201cinvisible\nmoments\u201d of time. If we were conscious of nothing beyond these\ndurationless episodes is not obvious how we could experience\nsuccession. But Hume also held that we apprehend the way\n(\u201cmanner\u201d) momentary perceptions are arranged or\norganized, and to these \u201ccompound impressions\u201d there are\ncorresponding \u201ccompound ideas\u201d. As Lorne Falkenstein\ninterprets Hume, compound ideas are themselves extended in time:\n\n\n[Hume] takes ideas to be objects in their own right, that represent\nsomething else by resembling it. \u2026 An idea of time represents\ntime by being itself extended in time. (Falkenstein 1997: 193)\n\n\nIf ideas of succession are themselves temporally extended, was Hume an\nearly advocate of extensionalism? For Adrian Bardon the answer is\nclear and in the affirmative: in the Treatise\n\n\nHume articulates an extensionalist account of our perception of space\nand time\u2014an almost entirely disregarded account that really\nought to be the locus classicus for extensionalism. (2019:\n 468)[11]\n\n\nIn his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (1785,\nhenceforth EIP) Thomas Reid questioned some of Locke\u2019s claims.\nFor Locke succession is a more basic concept than duration\u2014since\nwe arrive at the concept of duration by reflecting on the distances\nbetween parts of successions\u2014but Reid argues the reverse is the\ncase. For a succession to exist at all, its parts\u2014either\nparticular impressions or the intervals between them\u2014must\nthemselves already have duration: for if these parts were all entirely\nlacking in duration, we would be dealing with a purely momentary\nphenomenon, and hence something which could not contain any kind of\nsuccession. Hence succession presupposes duration, and not vice-versa.\nMoreover, Reid held that our direct awareness is incapable of spanning\neven a brief temporal interval: \u201cConsciousness, and every kind\nof thought, is transient and momentary, and has no continued\nexistence\u201d (EIP: III.6, p. 336). If our consciousness is\ninstantaneous and transient it is difficult to see how we could ever\nbe conscious of succession, and this is the stance Reid adopts:\n\n\nIt may here be observed that, if we speak strictly and\nphilosophically, no kind of succession can be an object either of the\nsenses or of consciousness; because the operations of both are\nconfined to the present point of time, and there can be no succession\nin a point of time; and on that account the motion of a body, which is\na successive change of place, could not be observed by the senses\nalone without the aid of memory. (EIP: III.5, pp. 325\u2013326)\n\n\nSince the claim that we are immediately aware only of what is present\ncan seem common sense of the plainest sort, it is not surprising to\nfind Reid endorsing it. Reid recognizes that it seems equally\ncommonsensical to say that we see bodies move\u2014after\nall, we often talk in such terms: e.g., \u201cI saw her waving her\narm\u201d. In response he argues that such talk is perfectly\nlegitimate, provided it is construed in loose or popular sense, and\nnot taken strictly and\n literally.[12]\n See Levanon (2016a) for a more detailed analysis of Reid\u2019s\nviews\u2014and his criticisms of Locke.\n",
