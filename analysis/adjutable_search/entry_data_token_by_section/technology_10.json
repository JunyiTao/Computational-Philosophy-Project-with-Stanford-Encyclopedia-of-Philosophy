The scholars\nstudying ethical issues in technology have diverse backgrounds (e.g.,\nphilosophy, STS, TA, law, political science, and STEM disciplines) and\nthey do not always consider themselves (primarily) ethicists of\ntechnology. To give the reader an overview of the field, three basic\napproaches or strands that might be distinguished in the ethics of\ntechnology will be discussed.\n3.2.1 Cultural and political approaches\n\nBoth cultural and political approaches build on the traditional\nphilosophy and ethics of technology of the first half of the twentieth\ncentury. Whereas cultural approaches conceive of technology as a\ncultural phenomenon that influences our perception of the world,\npolitical approaches conceive of technology as a political phenomenon,\ni.e., as a phenomenon that is ruled by and embodies institutional\npower relations between people.\n\nCultural approaches are often phenomenological in nature or at least\nposition themselves in relation to phenomenology as\npost-phenomenology. Examples of philosophers in this tradition are Don\nIhde, Albert Borgmann, Peter-Paul Verbeek and Evan Selinger (e.g.,\nBorgmann 1984; Ihde 1990; Verbeek 2000 [2005], 2011). The approaches\nare usually influenced by developments in STS, especially the idea\nthat technologies contain a script that influences not only\npeople\u2019s perception of the world but also human behavior, and\nthe idea of the absence of a fundamental distinction between humans\nand non-humans, including technological artifacts (Akrich 1992; Latour\n1992, 1993; Ihde & Selinger 2003). The combination of both ideas\nhas led some to claim that technology has (moral) agency, a claim that\nis discussed below in\n Section 3.3.1.\n\nPolitical approaches to technology mostly go back to Marx, who assumed\nthat the material structure of production in society, in which\ntechnology is obviously a major factor, determined the economic and\nsocial structure of that society. Similarly, Langdon Winner has argued\nthat technologies can embody specific forms of power and authority\n(Winner 1980). According to him, some technologies are inherently\nnormative in the sense that they require or are strongly compatible\nwith certain social and political relations. Railroads, for example,\nseem to require a certain authoritative management structure. In other\ncases, technologies may be political due to the particular way they\nhave been designed. Some political approaches to technology are\ninspired by (American) pragmatism and, to a lesser extent, discourse\nethics. A number of philosophers, for example, have pleaded for a\ndemocratization of technological development and the inclusion of\nordinary people in the shaping of technology (Winner 1983; Sclove\n1995; Feenberg 1999). Such ideas are also echoed in recent\ninterdisciplinary approaches, such as Responsible Research and\nInnovation (RRI), that aim at opening up the innovation process to a\nbroader range of stakeholders and concerns (Owen et al. 2013).\n\nAlthough political approaches have obviously ethical ramifications,\nmany philosophers who initially adopted such approaches do not engage\nin explicit ethical reflection. Also in political philosophy,\ntechnology does not seem to have been taken up as an important topic.\nNevertheless, particularly in relation to digital technologies such as\nsocial media, algorithms and more generally Artificial Intelligence\n(AI), a range of political themes has recently been discussed, such as\nthreats to democracy (from e.g. social media), the power of Big Tech\ncompanies, and new forms of exploitation, domination and colonialism\nthat may come with AI (e.g., Coeckelbergh 2022; Susskind 2022; Zuboff\n2017; Adams 2021). An important emerging theme is also justice, which\ndoes not just encompass distributive justice (Rawls 1999), but also\nrecognition justice (Fraser and Honneth 2003) and procedural justice.\nQuestions about justice have not only been raised by digital\ntechnologies, but also by climate change and energy technologies,\nleading to the coinage of new notions like climate justice (Caney\n2014) and energy justice (Jenkins et al. 2016).\n3.2.2 Engineering ethics\n\nEngineering ethics started off in the 1980s in the United States,\nmerely as an educational effort. Engineering ethics is concerned with\n\u201cthe actions and decisions made by persons, individually or\ncollectively, who belong to the profession of engineering\u201d (Baum\n1980: 1). According to this approach, engineering is a profession, in\nthe same way as medicine is a profession.\n\nAlthough there is no agreement on how a profession exactly should be\ndefined, the following characteristics are often mentioned:\n\nA profession relies on specialized knowledge and skills that\nrequire a long period of study;\nThe occupational group has a monopoly on the carrying out of the\noccupation;\nThe assessment of whether the professional work is carried out in\na competent way is done by, and it is accepted that this can only be\ndone by, professional peers;\nA profession provides society with products, services or values\nthat are useful or worthwhile for society, and is characterized by an\nideal of serving society;\nThe daily practice of professional work is regulated by ethical\nstandards, which are derived from or relate to the society-serving\nideal of the profession.\n\n\nTypical ethical issues that are discussed in engineering ethics are\nprofessional obligations of engineers as exemplified in, for example,\ncodes of ethics of engineers, the role of engineers versus managers,\ncompetence, honesty, whistle-blowing, concern for safety and conflicts\nof interest (Davis 1998, 2005). Over the years, the scope of\nengineering ethics has been broadened. Whereas it initially often\nfocused on decisions of individual engineers and on questions like\nwhistle-blowing and loyalty, textbooks now also discuss the wider\ncontext in which such decisions are made and pay attention to for\nexample, the so-called problem of many hands (van de Poel and\nRoyakkers 2011; Peterson 2020) (see also section 3.3.2). Initially,\nthe focus was often primarily on safety concerns and issues like\ncompetence and conflicts of interests, but nowadays also issues of\nsustainability, social justice, privacy, global issues and the role of\ntechnology in society are discussed (Harris, Pritchard, and Rabins\n2014; Martin and Schinzinger 2022; Taebi 2021; Peterson 2020; van de\nPoel and Royakkers 2011).\n3.2.3 Ethics of specific technologies\n\nThe last decades have witnessed an enormous increase in ethical\ninquiries into specific technologies. This may now be the largest of\nthe three strands discussed, especially given the rapid growth in\ntechnology-specific ethical inquiries in the last two decades. One of\nthe most visible new fields nowadays is digital ethics, which evolved\nfrom computer ethics (e.g., Moor 1985; Floridi 2010; Johnson 2009;\nWeckert 2007; van den Hoven & Weckert 2008), with more recently a\nfocus on robotics, artificial intelligence, machine ethics, and the\nethics of algorithms (Lin, Abney, & Jenkins 2017; Nucci &\nSantoni de Sio 2016; Mittelstadt et al. 2016; Bostrom & Yudkowsky\n2014; Wallach & Allen 2009, Coeckelbergh 2020b). Other\ntechnologies like biotechnology have also spurred dedicated ethical\ninvestigations (e.g., Sherlock & Morrey 2002; P. Thompson 2007).\nMore traditional fields like architecture and urban planning have also\nattracted specific ethical attention (Fox 2000). Nanotechnology and\nso-called converging technologies have led to the establishment of\nwhat is called nanoethics (Allhoff et al. 2007). Other examples are\nthe ethics of nuclear deterrence (Finnis et al. 1988), nuclear energy\n(Taebi & Roeser 2015) and geoengineering (Christopher Preston\n2016).\n\nObviously the establishment of such new fields of ethical reflection\nis a response to social and technological developments. Still, the\nquestion can be asked whether the social demand is best met by\nestablishing new fields of applied ethics. This issue is in fact\nregularly discussed as new fields emerge. Several authors have for\nexample argued that there is no need for nanoethics because\nnanotechnology does not raise any really new ethical issues (e.g.,\nMcGinn 2010). The alleged absence of newness here is supported by the\nclaim that the ethical issues raised by nanotechnology are a variation\non, and sometimes an intensification of, existing ethical issues, but\nhardly really new, and by the claim that these issues can be dealt\nwith the existing theories and concepts from moral philosophy. For an\nearlier, similar discussion concerning the supposed new character of\nethical issues in computer engineering, see Tavani 2002.\n\nThe new fields of ethical reflection are often characterized as\napplied ethics, that is, as applications of theories, normative\nstandards, concepts and methods developed in moral philosophy. For\neach of these elements, however, application is usually not\nstraightforward but requires a further specification or revision. This\nis the case because general moral standards, concepts and methods are\noften not specific enough to be applicable in any direct sense to\nspecific moral problems. \u2018Application\u2019 therefore often\nleads to new insights which might well result in the reformulation or\nat least refinement of existing normative standards, concepts and\nmethods. In some cases, ethical issues in a specific field might\nrequire new standards, concepts or methods. Beauchamp and Childress\nfor example have proposed a number of general ethical principles for\nbiomedical ethics (Beauchamp & Childress 2001). These principles\nare more specific than general normative standards, but still so\ngeneral and abstract that they apply to different issues in biomedical\nethics. In computer ethics, existing moral concepts relating to for\nexample privacy and ownership has been redefined and adapted to deal\nwith issues which are typical for the computer age (Johnson 2003). An\nexample is Nissenbaum\u2019s proposal to understand privacy in terms\nof contextual integrity (Nissenbaum 2010). New fields of ethical\napplication might also require new methods for, for example,\ndiscerning ethical issues that take into account relevant empirical\nfacts about these fields, like the fact that technological research\nand development usually takes place in networks of people rather than\nby individuals (Zwart et al. 2006). Another more general issue that\napplies to many new technologies is how to deal with the uncertainties\nabout (potential) social and ethical impacts that typically surround\nnew emerging technologies. Brey\u2019s (2012) proposal for an\nanticipatory ethics may be seen as a reply to this challenge. The\nissue of anticipation is also one of the central concerns in the more\nrecent interdisciplinary field of Responsible Research and Innovation\n(RRI) (e.g., Owen et al. 2013).\n\nAlthough different fields of ethical reflection on specific\ntechnologies might well raise their own philosophical and ethical\nissues, it can be questioned whether this justifies the development of\nseparate subfields or even subdisciplines. One obvious argument might\nbe that in order to say something ethically meaningful about new\ntechnologies, one needs specialized and detailed knowledge of a\nspecific technology. Moreover such subfields allow interaction with\nrelevant non-philosophical experts in for example law, psychology,\neconomy, science and technology studies (STS) or technology assessment\n(TA), as well as the relevant STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,\nMedicine) disciplines. On the other side, it could also be argued that\na lot can be learned from interaction and discussion between ethicists\nspecializing in different technologies, and a fruitful interaction\nwith the two other strands discussed above (cultural and political\napproaches and engineering ethics). In particular more political\napproaches to technology can be complementary to approaches that focus\non ethical issue of specific technologies (such as AI) by drawing\nattention to justice issues, power differences and the role of larger\ninstitutional and international contexts. Currently, such interaction\nin many cases seems absent, although there are of course\nexceptions.\n3.3 Some Recurrent Themes in the Ethics of Technology\n\nWe now turn to the description of some specific themes in the ethics\nof technology. We focus on a number of general themes that provide an\nillustration of general issues in the ethics of technology and the way\nthese are treated.\n3.3.1 Neutrality versus moral agency\n\nOne important general theme in the ethics of technology is the\nquestion whether technology is value-laden. Some authors have\nmaintained that technology is value-neutral, in the sense that\ntechnology is just a neutral means to an end, and accordingly can be\nput to good or bad use (e.g., Pitt 2000). This view might have some\nplausibility in as far as technology is considered to be just a bare\nphysical structure. Most philosophers of technology, however, agree\nthat technological development is a goal-oriented process and that\ntechnological artifacts by definition have certain functions, so that\nthey can be used for certain goals but not, or far more difficulty or\nless effectively, for other goals. This conceptual connection between\ntechnological artifacts, functions and goals makes it hard to maintain\nthat technology is value-neutral. Even if this point is granted, the\nvalue-ladenness of technology can be construed in a host of different\nways. Some authors have maintained that technology can have moral\nagency. This claim suggests that technologies can autonomously and\nfreely \u2018act\u2019 in a moral sense and can be held morally\nresponsible for their actions.\n\nThe debate whether technologies can have moral agency started off in\ncomputer ethics (Bechtel 1985; Snapper 1985; Dennett 1997; Floridi\n& Sanders 2004) but has since broadened. Typically, the authors\nwho claim that technologies (can) have moral agency often redefine the\nnotion of agency or its connection to human will and freedom (e.g.,\nLatour 1993; Floridi & Sanders 2004, Verbeek 2011). A disadvantage\nof this strategy is that it tends to blur the morally relevant\ndistinctions between people and technological artifacts. More\ngenerally, the claim that technologies have moral agency sometimes\nseems to have become shorthand for claiming that technology is morally\nrelevant. This, however, overlooks the fact technologies can be\nvalue-laden in other ways than by having moral agency (see, e.g.,\nJohnson 2006; Radder 2009; Illies & Meijers 2009; Peterson &\nSpahn 2011; Miller 2020; Klenk 2021). One might, for example, claim\nthat technology enables (or even invites) and constrains (or even\ninhibits) certain human actions and the attainment of certain human\ngoals and therefore is to some extent value-laden, without claiming\nmoral agency for technological artifacts. A good overview of the\ndebate can be found in Kroes and Verbeek 2014.\n\nThe debate about moral agency and technology is now particularly\nsalient with respect to the design of intelligent artificial agents.\nJames Moor (2006) has distinguished between four ways in which\nartificial agents may be or become moral agents:\n\nEthical impact agents are robots and computer systems that\nethically impact their environment; this is probably true of all\nartificial agents.\nImplicit ethical agents are artificial agents that have been\nprogrammed to act according to certain values.\nExplicit ethical agents are machines that can represent ethical\ncategories and that can \u2018reason\u2019 (in machine language)\nabout these.\nFull ethical agents in addition also possess some characteristics\nwe often consider crucial for human agency, like consciousness, free\nwill and intentionality.\n\n\nIt might perhaps never be possible to technologically design full\nethical agents, and if it were to become possible it might be\nquestionable whether it is morally desirable to do so (Bostrom &\nYudkowsky 2014; van Wynsberghe and Robbins 2019). As Wallach and Allen\n(2009) have pointed out, the main problem might not be to design\nartificial agents that can function autonomously and that can adapt\nthemselves in interaction with the environment, but rather to build\nenough, and the right kind of, ethical sensitivity into such\nmachines.\n\nApart from the question whether intelligent artificial agents can have\nmoral agency, there are (broader) questions about their moral status;\nfor example would they\u2014and if so under what\nconditions\u2014qualify as moral patients, to which humans have\ncertain moral obligations. Traditionally, moral status is connected to\nconsciousness, but a number of authors have proposed more minimal\ncriteria for moral status, particularly for (social) robots. For\nexample, Danaher (2020) has suggested that behaviouristic criteria\nmight suffice whereas Coeckelbergh (2014) and Gunkel (2018) have\nsuggested a relational approach. Mosakas (2021) has argued that such\napproaches do not ground moral status, and hence humans have no direct\nmoral duties towards social robots (although they may still be morally\nrelevant in other ways). Others have suggested that social robots\nsometimes may deceive us into believing they have certain cognitive\nand emotional capabilities (that may give them also moral status)\nwhile they have not (Sharkey and Sharkey 2021).\n3.3.2 Responsibility\n\nResponsibility has always been a central theme in the ethics of\ntechnology. The traditional philosophy and ethics of technology,\nhowever, tended to discuss responsibility in rather general terms and\nwere rather pessimistic about the possibility of engineers to assume\nresponsibility for the technologies they developed. Ellul, for\nexample, has characterized engineers as the high priests of\ntechnology, who cherish technology but cannot steer it. Hans Jonas\n(1979 [1984]) has argued that technology requires an ethics in which\nresponsibility is the central imperative because for the first time in\nhistory we are able to destroy the earth and humanity.\n\nIn engineering ethics, the responsibility of engineers is often\ndiscussed in relation to code of ethics that articulate specific\nresponsibilities of engineers. Such codes of ethics stress three types\nof responsibilities of engineers: (1) conducting the profession with\nintegrity and honesty and in a competent way, (2) responsibilities\ntowards employers and clients and (3) responsibility towards the\npublic and society. With respect to the latter, most US codes of\nethics maintain that engineers \u2018should hold paramount the\nsafety, health and welfare of the public\u2019.\n\nAs has been pointed out by several authors (Nissenbaum 1996; Johnson\n& Powers 2005; Swierstra & Jelsma 2006), it may be hard to\npinpoint individual responsibility in engineering. The reason is that\nthe conditions for the proper attribution of individual responsibility\nthat have been discussed in the philosophical literature (like freedom\nto act, knowledge, and causality) are often not met by individual\nengineers. For example, engineers may feel compelled to act in a\ncertain way due to hierarchical or market constraints, and negative\nconsequences may be very hard or impossible to predict beforehand. The\ncausality condition is often difficult to meet as well due to the long\nchain from research and development of a technology till its use and\nthe many people involved in this chain. Davis (2012) nevertheless\nmaintains that despite such difficulties individual engineers can and\ndo take responsibility.\n\nOne issue that is at stake in this debate is the notion of\nresponsibility. Davis (2012), and also for example Ladd (1991), argue\nfor a notion of responsibility that focuses less on blame and stresses\nthe forward-looking or virtuous character of assuming responsibility.\nBut many others focus on backward-looking notions of responsibility\nthat stress accountability, blameworthiness or liability. Zandvoort\n(2000), for example has pleaded for a notion of responsibility in\nengineering that is more like the legal notion of strict liability, in\nwhich the knowledge condition for responsibility is seriously\nweakened. Doorn (2012) compares three perspectives on responsibility\nascription in engineering\u2014a merit-based, a right-based and a\nconsequentialist perspective\u2014and argues that the\nconsequentialist perspective, which applies a forward-looking notion\nof responsibility, is most powerful in influencing engineering\npractice.\n\nThe difficulty of attributing individual responsibility may lead to\nthe Problem of Many Hands (PMH). The term was first coined by Dennis\nThompson (1980) in an article about the responsibility of public\nofficials. The term is used to describe problems with the ascription\nof individual responsibility in collective settings. Doorn (2010) has\nproposed a procedurals approach, based on Rawls\u2019 reflective\nequilibrium model, to deal with the PMH; other ways of dealing with\nthe PMH include the design of institutions that help to avoid it or an\nemphasis on virtuous behavior in organizations (van de Poel, Royakers,\n& Zwart 2015).\n\nWhereas the PMH refers to the problem of attributing responsibility\namong a collective of human agents, technological developments have\nalso made it possible to allocate tasks to self-learning and\nintelligent systems. Such systems may function and learn in ways that\nare hard to understand, predict and control for humans, leading to\nso-called \u2018responsibility gaps\u2019 (Matthias 2004). Since\nknowledge and control are usually seen as (essential) preconditions\nfor responsibility, lack thereof may make it increasingly difficult to\nhold humans responsible for the actions and consequences of\nintelligent systems.\n\nInitially, such responsibility gaps were mainly discussed in relation\nto autonomous weapon systems and self-driving cars (Sparrow 2007;\nDanaher 2016). As a possible solution, the notion of meaningful human\ncontrol has been proposed as a precondition for the development and\nemployment of such systems to ensure that human can retain control,\nand hence responsibility over these systems (Santoni de Sio and van\nden Hoven 2018). Nyholm (2018) has argued that many alleged cases of\nresponsibility gaps are better understood in terms collaborative\nhuman-technology agency (with humans in a supervising role) rather\nthan the technology taking over control. While responsibility gaps may\nnot impossible, the more difficult issue may be to attribute\nresponsibility to the various humans involved (which brings the PMH\nback on the table).\n\nMore recently, responsibility gaps have become a more general concern\nin relation to AI. Due to the advance of machine learning, AI systems\nmay learn in ways that are hard, or almost impossible to understand\nfor humans. Initially, the dominant notion of responsibility addressed\nin the literature on responsibility gaps was blameworthiness or\nculpability, but Santoni de Sio and Mecacci (2021) have recently\nproposed to distinguish between what they call culpability gaps, moral\naccountability gaps, public accountability gaps, and active\nresponsibility gaps.\n3.3.3 Design\n\nIn the last decades, increasingly attention is paid not only to\nethical issues that arise during the use of a technology, but also\nduring the design phase. An important consideration behind this\ndevelopment is the thought that during the design phase technologies,\nand their social consequences, are still malleable whereas during the\nuse phase technologies are more or less given and negative social\nconsequences may be harder to avoid or positive effects harder to\nachieve.\n\nIn computer ethics, an approach known as Value Sensitive Design (VSD)\nhas been developed to explicitly address the ethical nature of design.\nVSD aims at integrating values of ethical importance in engineering\ndesign in a systematic way (Friedman & Hendry 2019). The approach\ncombines conceptual, empirical and technical investigations. There is\nalso a range of other approaches aimed at including values in design.\n\u2018Design for X\u2019 approaches in engineering aim at including\ninstrumental values (like maintainability, reliability and costs) but\nthey also include design for sustainability, inclusive design, and\naffective design (Holt & Barnes 2010). Inclusive design aims at\nmaking designs accessible to the whole population including, for\nexample, handicapped people and the elderly (Erlandson 2008).\nAffective design aims at designs that evoke positive emotions with the\nusers and so contributes to human well-being. Van de Hoven, Vermaas,\nand van de Poel 2015 gives a good overview of the state-of-the art of\nvalue sensitive design for various values and application domains.\n\nIf one tries to integrate values into design one may run into the\nproblem of a conflict of values. The safest car is, due to its weight,\nnot likely to be the most sustainability. Here safety and\nsustainability conflict in the design of cars. Traditional methods in\nwhich engineers deal with such conflicts and make trade-off between\ndifferent requirements for design include cost-benefit analysis and\nmultiple criteria analysis. Such methods are, however, beset with\nmethodological problems like those discussed in\n Section 2.4\n (Franssen 2005; Hansson 2007). Van de Poel (2009) discusses various\nalternatives for dealing with value conflicts in design including the\nsetting of thresholds (satisficing), reasoning about values,\ninnovation and diversity.\n3.3.4 Technological risks\n\nThe risks of technology are one of the traditional ethical concerns in\nthe ethics of technology. Risks raise not only ethical issues but\nother philosophical issues, such as epistemological and\ndecision-theoretical issues as well (Roeser et al. 2012).\n\nRisk is usually defined as the product of the probability of an\nundesirable event and the effect of that event, although there are\nalso other definitions around (Hansson 2004b). In general it seems\ndesirable to keep technological risks as small as possible. The larger\nthe risk, the larger either the likeliness or the impact of an\nundesirable event is. Risk reduction therefore is an important goal in\ntechnological development and engineering codes of ethics often\nattribute a responsibility to engineers in reducing risks and\ndesigning safe products. Still, risk reduction is not always feasible\nor desirable. It is sometimes not feasible, because there are no\nabsolutely safe products and technologies. But even if risk reduction\nis feasible it may not be acceptable from a moral point of view.\nReducing risk often comes at a cost. Safer products may be more\ndifficult to use, more expensive or less sustainable. So sooner or\nlater, one is confronted with the question: what is safe enough? What\nmakes a risk (un)acceptable?\n\nThe process of dealing with risks is often divided into three stages:\nrisk assessment, risk evaluation and risk management. Of these, the\nsecond is most obviously ethically relevant. However, risk assessment\nalready involves value judgments, for example about which risks should\nbe assessed in the first place (Shrader-Frechette 1991). An important,\nand morally relevant, issue is also the degree of evidence that is\nneeded to establish a risk. In establishing a risk on the basis of a\nbody of empirical data one might make two kinds of mistakes. One can\nestablish a risk when there is actually none (type I error) or one can\nmistakenly conclude that there is no risk while there actually is a\nrisk (type II error). Science traditionally aims at avoiding type I\nerrors. Several authors have argued that in the specific context of\nrisk assessment it is often more important to avoid type II errors\n(Cranor 1990; Shrader-Frechette 1991). The reason for this is that\nrisk assessment not just aims at establishing scientific truth but has\na practical aim, i.e., to provide the knowledge on basis of which\ndecisions can be made about whether it is desirable to reduce or avoid\ncertain technological risks in order to protect users or the\npublic.\n\nRisk evaluation is carried out in a number of ways (see, e.g.,\nShrader-Frechette 1985). One possible approach is to judge the\nacceptability of risks by comparing them to other risks or to certain\nstandards. One could, for example, compare technological risks with\nnaturally occurring risks. This approach, however, runs the danger of\ncommitting a naturalistic fallacy: naturally occurring risks may\n(sometimes) be unavoidable but that does not necessarily make them\nmorally acceptable. More generally, it is often dubious to judge the\nacceptability of the risk of technology A by comparing it to the risk\nof technology B if A and B are not alternatives in a decision (for\nthis and other fallacies in reasoning about risks, see Hansson\n2004a).\n\nA second approach to risk evaluation is risk-cost benefit analysis,\nwhich is based on weighing the risks against the benefits of an\nactivity. Different decision criteria can be applied if a (risk) cost\nbenefit analysis is carried out (Kneese, Ben-David, and Schulze 1983).\nAccording to Hansson (2003: 306), usually the following criterion is\napplied: \n\n\n\u2026 a risk is acceptable if and only if the total benefits that\nthe exposure gives rise to outweigh the total risks, measured as the\nprobability-weighted disutility of outcomes.\n\n\nA third approach is to base risk acceptance on the consent of people\nwho suffer the risks after they have been informed about these risks\n(informed consent). A problem of this approach is that technological\nrisks usually affect a large number of people at once. Informed\nconsent may therefore lead to a \u201csociety of stalemates\u201d\n(Hansson 2003: 300).\n\nSeveral authors have proposed alternatives to the traditional\napproaches of risk evaluation on the basis of philosophical and\nethical arguments. Shrader-Frechette (1991) has proposed a number of\nreforms in risk assessment and evaluation procedures on the basis of a\nphilosophical critique of current practices. Roeser (2012) argues for\na role of emotions in judging the acceptability of risks. Hansson has\nproposed the following alternative principle for risk evaluation: \n\n\nExposure of a person to a risk is acceptable if and only if this\nexposure is part of an equitable social system of risk-taking that\nworks to her advantage. (Hansson 2003: 305) \n\n\nHansson\u2019s proposal introduces a number of moral considerations\nin risk evaluation that are traditionally not addressed or only\nmarginally addressed. These are the consideration whether individuals\nprofit from a risky activity and the consideration whether the\ndistribution of risks and benefits is fair.\n\nQuestions about acceptable risk may also be framed in terms of risk\nimposition. The question is then under what conditions it is\nacceptable for some agent A to impose a risk on some other agent B.\nThe criteria for acceptable risk imposition are in part similar to the\nones discussed above. A risk imposition may, for example, be (more)\nacceptable if agent B gave their informed consent, or if the risky\nactivity that generates the risk is beneficial for agent B. However,\nother considerations come in as well, like the relation between agent\nA and agent B. It might perhaps be acceptable for parents to impose\ncertain risks on their children, while it would be improper for the\ngovernment to impose such risks on children.\n\nRisk impositions may particularly be problematic if they lead to\ndomination or domination-like effects (Maheshwari and Nyholm 2022).\nDomination is here understood in the republican sense proposed by\nphilosophers like Pettit (2012). Freedom from domination does not just\nrequire people to have different options to choose from, but also to\nbe free from the (potential) arbitrary interference in the\n(availability of) these options by others. Non-domination thus\nrequires that others do not have the power to arbitrary interfere with\none\u2019s options (whether that power is exercised or not). Risk\nimposition may lead to domination (or at least dominating-like\neffects) if agent A (the risk imposer) by imposing a risk on agent B\n(the risk bearer) can arbitrary affect the range of safe options\navailable to agent B.\n\nSome authors have criticized the focus on risks in the ethics of\ntechnology. One strand of criticism argues that we often lack the\nknowledge to reliably assess the risks of a new technology before it\nhas come into use. We often do not know the probability that something\nmight go wrong, and sometimes we even do not know, or at least not\nfully, what might go wrong and what possible negative consequences may\nbe. To deal with this, some authors have proposed to conceive of the\nintroduction of new technology in society as a social experiment and\nhave urged to think about the conditions under which such experiments\nare morally acceptable (Martin & Schinzinger 2022; van de Poel\n2016). Another strand of criticism states that the focus on risks has\nled to a reduction of the impacts of technology that are considered\n(Swierstra & te Molder 2012). Only impacts related to safety and\nhealth, which can be calculated as risks, are considered, whereas\n\u2018soft\u2019 impacts, for example of a social or psychological\nnature, are neglected, thereby impoverishing the moral evaluation of\nnew technologies.",
