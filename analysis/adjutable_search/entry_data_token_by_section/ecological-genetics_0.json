    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nIn this entry, I review briefly the history of ecological genetic\nresearch and its recent integration with molecular genetic methods in\nthe sub-field of molecular ecology. Most studies in ecological\ngenetics begin with one or the other of the two most prominent\npatterns in nature: \n\nadaptation, the \u201cfit\u201d between an organism and its\nenvironment (see the entry on\n fitness);\n or, \npolymorphism, the maintenance of two or more phenotypic or genetic\nforms within a single population by natural selection. \n\n\nWith the development of molecular ecology, the latter can be\nsignificantly extended to explore phenotypic differences between\nspecies in a phylogenetic context. This permits a more incisive\ninvestigation of the environments that favor adaptive divergence of\nphenotypes between species. Moreover, the same molecular methods\nuseful in phylogenetics can often be modified to identify the genes or\nchromosomal regions responsible for those inter-specific phenotypes\n(Gibson et al. 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nThe earliest studies attempted to document the action of natural\nselection in wild populations in support of Darwinian\u2019s theory.\nIn so doing, these studies attempted to demonstrate that evolution by\nnatural selection was not only an historical causal force, but that it\nalso continued to act on the characteristics of wild populations in\nthe present day. Under the assumption of gradualism, it was not clear\nwhether natural selecting acting on phenotypes in wild populations\ncould be detected, let alone account for between species phenotypic\ndifferences. The starting observations of many of the earliest\necological genetic investigations, i.e., the phenotypes of most\ninterest, were conspicuous phenotypic polymorphisms, such as the\nspotting patterns on butterfly wings or banding patterns of snail\nshells or polymorphisms of chromosomal rearrangements. These were\neither known to have a genetic basis or could safely be assumed to\nhave one.\n\nAlthough natural selection is the only evolutionary force that can\naccount for adaptation, several evolutionary forces, acting alone or\nin combination, can sustain a genetic polymorphism, at least\ntransiently. Thus, assigning causal agency to a single evolutionary\nforce is often a more difficult problem when explaining polymorphism\nwithin species than it is for adaptations. In these studies of\nconspicuous polymorphisms, natural selection was\n\u201cprivileged\u201d among the four evolutionary forces as an\nexplanation for their maintenance, at least in part, because one of\nthe founders of ecological genetics, E. B. Ford, collaborated\nextensively with R. A. Fisher (see Ford 1975). In the early period\n(1928\u20131950), much of the problem of assigning causal agency to\nthe maintenance of genetic polymorphism was resolved by definition\nrather than by empirical observation (see section 2 below:\n Classical Ecological Genetics and Polymorphism).\n That is, only those polymorphisms where the rarest form was deemed\n\u201ctoo common\u201d to be accounted for by recurrent mutation\nwere considered suitable for study. Moreover, if the species was\nabundant, then random genetic drift could similarly be eliminated as a\nrelevant process. Indeed, the longest standing controversies in\necological genetics centered on whether natural selection could\naccount for the observed frequencies of polymorphism or whether the\nvariation in those frequencies indicated a significant role of random\ngenetic drift (see, for example, Schemske and Bierzychudek [2001]\nregarding the interpretation of flower color polymorphism in the\ndesert annual, Linanthus parryae).\n\nIn the later period (1966\u2013present), the advent of allozymes and\nmolecular genetics permitted investigation of a less biased sample of\ngenetic polymorphism. The modern characterization and analyses of\nallozymes and single nucleotide polymorphisms still retains the early\nemphasis on natural selection as the single most important\nevolutionary force shaping the hereditary material. Differently put,\nadaptive explanations for patterns of species divergence tend to be\nfavored over non-adaptive explanations (see recent review of the\ncauses of the rapid diversification among species of reproductive\ngenes by Dapper and Wade [2020].)\n\nEcological genetics began at a time when the major theoretical aspects\nof the Modern Synthesis were in place, when the marvels of adaptation\nwere clear, but when few empirical examples of natural selection in\naction were available. Achieving adaptive perfection by gradualism\nrequires long periods of time wherein \n\n\n\u2026 a very slight selective effect acting for a correspondingly\nlong time will be equivalent to a much greater effect acting for a\nproportionately shorter time. (R. A. Fisher 1921, in correspondence\nwith S. Wright, quoted by Provine [1986: 247]) \n\n\nVery weak natural selection, however, is an impediment to the goal of\necological genetics to illuminate natural selection in action in the\nwild. Thus, the shift in focus toward understanding the role of strong\nnatural selection in maintaining visible genetic polymorphisms is\nunderstandable. As put by its founder, E. B. Ford, \n\n\nIt [ecological genetics] supplies the means, and the only direct\nmeans, of investigating the actual process of evolution taking place\nin the present time. (1975: 3)\n\n\nThe focus of traditional ecological genetic research on the current\naction of natural selection has been broadened in several ways over\nthe last two decades. First, whereas the early studies tended to focus\non evolution in single populations, there is now a significant\nemphasis in ecological genetics on the population genetic structure of\nmetapopulations and the roles of migration, extinction, and\ncolonization on evolutionary and adaptive processes (e.g., Goodacre\n2002). Secondly, whereas the earliest studies emphasized conspicuous\npolymorphisms or chromosomal rearrangements and their influence on\nfitness, the advent of biochemical genetics in the late 1960s\nsignificantly broadened the phenotype, beginning with the application\nof electrophoretic methods to population studies. These studies\nrevealed abundant \u201chidden polymorphism\u201d in the new,\nbiochemical phenotype of enzyme mobility. These methods extended the\ndomain of ecological genetics from the classic \u201cconspicuous\nphenotypic polymorphisms\u201d in color, shape and behavior to the\nphysiological domain of enzyme function. The new emphasis on\nfunctional biochemical phenotypes, however, did not change the\nexplanatory or causal framework of the field. Determining the role of\nnatural selection in maintaining enzyme polymorphisms, such as the\nfast/slow polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase (an enzyme involved\nin the detoxification of environmental alcohols), superoxide dismutase\n(which catalyzes the removal of free oxygen radicals), or the\nesterases (which are involved in the detoxification of pesticides in\nmany insects), became a primary focus of investigation with the goal\nof finding a selective basis for the enzyme variants in terms\nof differences in their physical and kinetic properties. Indeed, the\nroots of controversy between the selectionist and neutralist schools\nover the maintenance of \u201cbalanced\u201d polymorphisms (see\nLewontin 1974) lie in the controversy over random genetic drift versus\nnatural selection in early ecological genetic research (see\nbelow).\n\nThe more recent advent of DNA sequencing initiated the growth of\nmolecular phylogenetics and molecular ecology. The new technology\nadded not only a new phenotype, but also a more pronounced historical\n(phylogenetic) dimension to ecological genetic research. Molecular\nphylogenics and comparative sequence analysis have become the primary\nmodern tools for the investigation of the evolutionary patterns and\nprocesses that shape DNA sequences. These methods have strengthened\ninferences regarding biogeography, speciation, and adaptation,\nespecially in regard to the diversification of taxonomic lineages that\nattends ecological release and adaptive radiations. They have shifted\nthe focus from polymorphism within species to diversification among\nclades (e.g., Kostyun et al. 2019) and permitted the investigation of\nthe history of individual genes (Gibson et al. 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n For example, ecological genomic data have permitted the\nreconstruction of the invasion of the Galapagos Islands by the wild\ntomato species, Solanum pimpinellifolium, through\nhybridization and introgression with a closely related endemic\nspecies, Solanum cheesmaniae. Moreover, an adaptive\nphenotype, orange fruit color similar to the endemic species, is\nassociated with two introgressed regions of the Solanum\ngenome which contain known fruit color loci, supporting the inference\nthat adaptive convergence was genetically facilitated by introgression\n(Gibson et al. 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nTwo new patterns in particular have been recognized by these DNA-based\nmethods. The first is the preponderance of \u201cpurifying\nselection\u201d, wherein the conservative power of natural selection\nis seen as a barrier to diversity. It is this conservative aspect of\nnatural selection acting at the molecular level that lends power to\nthe investigation of the genetic architecture of model organisms\nvis \u00e0 vis human genetics. The second pattern is the\ndiscovery of the existence of ancient polymorphisms,\nmolecular genetic variation whose age may be greater than that of the\nspecies or taxon in which it occurs. Natural selection remains the\nprivileged explanatory force in modern sequence studies. Indeed, the\nsearch for, characterization, and explanation of uniquely molecular\npatterns, such as codon bias (Behura & Severson 2013) and\nselective sweeps, has, if anything, elevated the focal explanatory\npower of natural selection in evolutionary studies. That is, nonrandom\nor biased use of redundant codons in DNA sequences is seen as evidence\nthat, although they have no effect on amino acid sequence, redundant\ncodons are not all functionally equivalent in that some permit more\nefficient gene expression. This is taken as evidence that natural\nselection is all powerful, reaching down into the genome to affect\neven the smallest and least significant components of the hereditary\nmaterial.\n\nIn this entry, I review classical ecological genetics and then discuss\nthe novel kinds of processes and explanations that accompanied the\nexpansion of the field from single populations to genetically\nstructured metapopulations and from phenotypic to biochemical and DNA\nsequence polymorphisms. I will show that the central early controversy\nover the roles of random genetic drift and natural selection in\nevolution has continued to this day, despite the apparent\ntechnological refinements afforded by the availability of biochemical\nand DNA sequence data. That is, finer scale or more reductionistic\ngenetic data has not yet led to a resolution of the original\nconceptual issues that lie at the foundation of ecological\ngenetics.\n",
