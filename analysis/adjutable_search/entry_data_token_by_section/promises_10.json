    "main_text": "Expectation Theory || Reliance\n3.2 Reliance\n\nA more demanding requirement is that a promisee must in fact suffer\nfrom some loss or harm in order for a wrong to have occurred, and this\nis what another expectational tradition, reliance views, propose. The\nparadigm of a contemporary reliance view is Thomson\u2019s\n(1990).\n\nFor Thomson, a promise is an invitation to rely on the\npromisor\u2019s performance, where that means expect and plan around\nthat future performance, and not merely come to believe or expect\nit.\n\nSomething like a reliance understanding of promises plausibly\nunderlies the private law doctrine of \u201cconsideration\u201d,\nwhich indemnifies promisees for costs incurred as a result of such\nreliance (see\n Promise and Contract section 6.2\n below).\n",
