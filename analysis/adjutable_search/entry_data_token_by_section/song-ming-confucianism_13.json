    "main_text": "Self-Cultivation || Mental Discipline\n4.2 Mental Discipline\n\nDue in part to the influence of Buddhism, Confucians in the Song-Ming\nperiod were interested in the many ways in which subtle or\nhard-to-detect psychological dispositions and phenomena can hamper our\nability to apprehend things clearly and correctly. Some thought that\nmost or all instances of moral failure could be credited to an\ninflated sense of one\u2019s own importance or self-centeredness\n(si), which manifests in selfish inclinations or desires that\nthen lead us astray (Shun 2010: 185\u2013187). Confucians in this era\nthus developed and argued about various techniques meant to help us\ndetect and undercut selfish inclinations and desires, and other\ntechniques which (much like Buddhist meditation) help quiet the mind\nso that it can respond to the world with more evenhandedness and\nequanimity.\n\nThe first set of techniques were concerned with detecting and\neradicating selfish thoughts or inclinations, a task they sometimes\ncharacterized as (or as part of) \u201covercoming the self\u201d\n(keji \u514b\u5df1). Many emphasized that it was most\nadvantageous to look for these thoughts and inclinations in liminal\nmoments of emotional incipience (ji \u6a5f), just as\nemotions are starting to enter consciousness but before they start to\nreshape other mental processes and dispositions (Smith et al. 1990:\n190\u2013199; Tiwald & Van Norden 2014: 282). Most Confucians in\nthe Song-Ming period endorsed this sort of self-monitoring, although\nsome seemed to think that it played a more important role in\nself-cultivation than others. Wang Yangming was among those who\nthought it central and indispensable for the work of improving\none\u2019s character and state of heartmind, sometimes saying that\nour selfish inclinations needed to be pursued like robbers and\nthoroughly eradicated (CXL 39, 60, 279). In contrast, Zhu Xi\nsaw self-monitoring as important but as somewhat less pervasively\ndemanding than Wang. On his view, much of the work of self-monitoring\nbecomes unnecessary if we fully realize or embody reverential\nattention (jing \u656c). Zhu likened the work of overcoming\nthe self to taking medicine for an illness: when one is in good health\n(instantiating proper reverential attention in all that one thinks\nabout) then taking medicine (self-monitoring) is unnecessary\n(ZZYL 9:151\u201352; Angle & Tiwald 2017: 146).\n\nSome Confucian debate in the Song-Ming period concerned the role of\nmeditation in achieving mental stability and insight. The most popular\nform for Confucians was known as \u201cquiet sitting\u201d\n(jingzuo \u975c\u5750), which many recommended as a way\nto achieve a state of quietude or tranquility (jing\n\u975c). Some Daoxue Confucians thought that we discover\nour virtuous inherent nature when the heartmind is in this state of\ntranquility, a view most notably held by Yang Shi (1053\u20131135), a\nstudent of the Cheng brothers. Zhu Xi rejected this conception of\nmeditation\u2019s role in self-cultivation, maintaining that we\ncannot experience or perceive our virtuous nature directly but only\nindirectly through its responses to worldly events, requiring a state\nof activity and responsiveness which isn\u2019t meditative (Angle\n& Tiwald 2017: 147\u2013149). Nevertheless, Zhu thought quiet\nsitting played important supporting roles in developing one\u2019s\ncapacities of mental discipline. He believed it an important\ncomplement to study and reflection and suggested that for some people\nwith particularly unruly heartminds it could be the most productive\npath to self-improvement (Chan 1989: 255\u2013270).\n\nAnother objection to over-reliance on meditation was that it would\nleave its practitioners ill-equipped to handle the demands of active\nlife, which (unlike quiet sitting) regularly tests our ability to\nmaintain control of our feelings in the face of provocations. Feelings\non the Confucian view should be both proportionate and responsive to\nthe correct events (for example, we should react with moderate anger\ntoward the moderate mistreatment of a friend and not react with fury\nto a minor, personal slight). For these purposes, Confucians suggested\nthat reverential attention (jing \u656c) is better suited\nto instill the right sort of self-control, one that they thought we\ncould use in both passive and active states. Zhu Xi described\nreverential attention both as a kind of concentration or focus and as\nan attitude showing respect and humility, and thus capable of putting\nprivate concerns in proper perspective and keeping selfish desires in\ncheck. He also recommended using reverential attention when reading\ntexts for ethical and philosophical insight (ZZYL 12; Chu\n1990: 170\u2013179; Zhu 2019: 28\u201332 and 49).\n",
