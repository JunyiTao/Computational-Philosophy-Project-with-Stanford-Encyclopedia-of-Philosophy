    "main_text": "Pragmatist Views || B\u00e4chtold\n4.2 B\u00e4chtold\n\nB\u00e4chtold (2008a,b) takes an approach to quantum theory he calls\npragmatist. Quoting C.S. Peirce\u2019s pragmatic maxim, he offers\nwhat he calls pragmatic definitions of terms used by researchers in\nmicrophysics, including \u201cpreparation\u201d,\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d, \u201cobservable\u201d, and\n\u201cmicroscopic system\u201d. His \u201cpragmatist\u201d\napproach to interpreting a theory is to isolate the pragmatic\nfunctions to be fulfilled by successful research activity in\nmicrophysics, and then to show that quantum theory alone fulfills\nthese functions.\n\nWhile acknowledging that his interpretation has an instrumentalist\nflavor, in his 2008a he distinguishes it from the instrumentalism of\nPeres (1995) and others, who all (allegedly) claim some metaphysical\nideas but seek to remove the expression \u201cmicroscopic\nsystem\u201d from the vocabulary used by quantum physicists. By\ncontrast, his \u201cpragmatic definition\u201d of that expression\nlicenses this usage, taking \u201cquantum system\u201d to refer to a\nspecified set of preparations.\n\nB\u00e4chtold (2008b: chapter 2) elaborates on his pragmatist\nconception of knowledge, appealing to a variety of philosophical\nprogenitors, including Peirce, James, Carnap, Wittgenstein, Putnam,\nand Kant. But his overall approach to quantum theory has strong\naffinities with operationalist approaches to the theory.\n",
