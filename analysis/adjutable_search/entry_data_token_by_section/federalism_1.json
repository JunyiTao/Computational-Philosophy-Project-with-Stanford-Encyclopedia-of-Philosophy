History of Federalism\n\nA wide-spread interest among political philosophers in topics\nconcerning the centralised nation state have fuelled attention to\nhistorical contributions on unitary sovereignty. However, we can also\nidentify a steady stream of contributions to the philosophy of\nfederalism, also by those more well known for their arguments\nconcerning centralised power (cf. Karmis and Norman 2005 for such\nreadings). Much of the Western literature on federalism has focused on\nthe unit of states. To underscore this bias, consider first some\nnon-Western practices and theories of federal features.\n",
