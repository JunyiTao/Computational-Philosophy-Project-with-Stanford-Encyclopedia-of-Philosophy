    "main_text": "Toward a Trans/Feminism || Evil Deceivers and Make-Believers\n11. Conclusion\n\n\nWhile early (non-trans) feminist perspectives on trans issues were\nmarked by hostility, trans studies and politics have emerged in\ncomplex reaction and interaction with feminist and queer theory and\npolitics as something to be recognized. As time has passed, it seems the\npossibility of productive interplay between feminist and trans theory\nand politics as well as solidarity between trans and non-trans\nfeminist is being realized. This suggests a promising future for trans\nfeminist philosophical investigations. In light of the history of\ntrans/feminist interaction, it seems that the self and its relation to\noppression and resistance will continue to be a fruitful topic of inquiry.\n",
