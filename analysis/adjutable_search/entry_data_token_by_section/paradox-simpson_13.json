    "main_text": "Applications || Decision Theory and the Sure-Thing Principle\n5.3 Decision Theory and the Sure-Thing Principle\n\nBlyth (1972) argued that Simpson\u2019s Paradox also constitutes a\ncounterexample to the sure-thing principle of decision theory, or at\nleast restricts its scope substantially. That principle is supposed to\nguide rational decisions under uncertainty, and has been stated by\nSavage as follows:\n\nSure-Thing Principle (STP) \u201cIf you\nwould definitely prefer \\(g\\) to \\(f\\) either knowing that the event\n\\(\\r{B}\\) obtained, or knowing that the event B did not obtain, then\nyou definitely prefer \\(g\\) to \\(f\\)\u201d. (Savage 1954:\n21\u201322)\n\nIn his purported counterexample, Blyth treats \\(\\r{B}\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\r{B}\\) as indicating the two subpopulations (e.g., two\ndifferent hospitals). Suppose that treatment \\(\\r{T}\\) is positively\nassociated with recovery \\(\\r{R}\\) for each subpopulation. In that\ncase, assuming equal odds, we would rather bet on the recovery of a\npatient in the treatment group (action \\(g\\)) than on the recovery on\nthe patient in a control group (action \\(f\\))\u2014regardless of\nwhether that person is in group \\(\\r{B}\\) or group \\(\\neg\\r{B}\\).\nThus, since we prefer \\(g\\) to \\(f\\) in either subpopulation, and\nsince all patients are either in group \\(\\r{B}\\) or in group\n\\(\\neg\\r{B}\\), we can infer, by the Sure-Thing Principle, that \\(g\\)\nis preferable to \\(f\\) also when we don\u2019t know whether a patient\nis in group \\(\\r{B}\\) or group \\(\\neg\\r{B}\\). But this inference is\nmistaken if association reversal occurs: it is perfectly compatible\nwith the above scenario that the overall frequency of recovery is\nhigher for non-treated than for treated patients! Blyth (1972: 366)\nconcludes that \n\n\nthe Sure-Thing Principle [\u2026] seems not applicable to situations\nin which any action taken within \\(f\\) or \\(g\\) [\u2026] is allowed\nto be based sequentially on events dependent with [\\(B\\)]. \n\n\nSee also Malinas (2001) for discussion.\n\nTo the extent that (conditional) degrees of belief just represent\n(conditional) dispositions to bet, Blyth\u2019s reasoning is\ncompelling. Association reversal means that  \n\n\\[p(\\r{R}\\mid \\r{T}) < (\\r{R}\\mid \\neg \\r{T})\\] \n\n\nalthough  \n\n\\[p(\\r{R}\\mid \\r{T}, \\r{B}) > (R\\mid \\neg \\r{T}, \\neg \\r{B})\\] \n\n\nand  \n\n\\[p(\\r{R}\\mid \\r{T}, \\r{B}) > (R\\mid \\neg \\r{T}, \\neg \\r{B}),\\]\n\n\nand thus preference for a conditional bet on \\(\\r{T}\\) (given the\nvarious levels of \\(B\\)) does not imply preference for the\nunconditional bet on \\(\\r{T}\\) (see\n Section 2).\n However, Savage certainly did not intend the sure-thing principle to\nbe a theorem of probability. To evaluate it as a principle that guides\nproper decision-making, we must consider cases where the predictor\nvariable (here: treatment/control) stands for a proper act\nthat affects the outcome via multiple paths.\n\nJeffrey (1982) recalls Savage\u2019s (1954: 21) example of a\nbusinessman who believes that it is advantageous to buy a property\nregardless of whether the Democratic or the Republican candidate will\nwin the upcoming mayor elections. Jeffrey\u2019s twist is that the\nbusinessman\u2019s utility depends not only on the property deal, but\nalso on the election outcome. Specifically, buying the property raises\nthe chances that the Democratic candidate, whom he dislikes, will win.\nIn that case he would certainly buy the property after the\nelection, regardless of the outcome, but he may refrain from buying it\nbefore the election.\n\nIn response to this challenge, Jeffrey (1982: 720) restricts the\nsure-thing principle to the case where \n\n\nchoice of one act or another is thought to have no tendency to\nfacilitate or impede the coming about of any of the possible states of\nnature, and [\u2026] this is reflected in a probabilistic\nindependence of states from acts. \n\n\nThat is, buying the property should not change our rational degree of\nbelief in who wins the election. Pearl (2016) considers this response\nan \u201coverkill\u201d and notes that probabilistic associations\nare not a good means of expressing causal tendencies. Therefore he\nproposes a causal sure-thing principle that we have encountered in\n Section 3.4:\n If one is considering two acts \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), and the\nprobability distribution of \\(\\r{B}\\) does not change depending on\nwhether one intervenes to choose \\(f\\) or \\(g\\), then if one\nprefers \\(f\\) to \\(g\\) whether or not \\(B\\) occurs, one prefers \\(f\\)\nunconditionally. The italicized condition ensures that the\npartitioning variable is not an effect of the intervention, and thus\nrules out Simpson\u2019s reversals (see\n section 3.4).\n Note that Pearl\u2019s formulation, but not Jeffrey\u2019s, allows\nto apply the (causal) sure-thing principle to observational data,\nwhere states and acts may be statistically dependent without\nindicating genuine causation (e.g., because of self-selection\neffects).\n\nThroughout this entry we have assumed knowledge of the causal facts\npertinent to a situation. Scenarios in which an agent lacks such\nknowledge raise additional complications for decision theory. An agent\ntypically cannot ensure that all confounders have been accounted for,\nand thus the possibility of repeated reversals raises questions about\nwhen one should adopt a promising policy that has not been\nexperimentally tested (Peters, Janzing, & Sch\u00f6lkopf 2017:\n174\u2013175). A distinct concern is that an agent may not be sure\nwhether her action counts as an intervention (e.g., in Newcomb\nscenarios), since it might not be clear whether she can manipulate a\nvariable to render it independent of its prior causes (Stern 2019).\nWhether Simpson\u2019s Paradox raises novel difficulties in such\ndecision-making contexts has not yet been explored. See the entries on\n decision theory\n and\n causal decision theory\n for further discussion.\n",
