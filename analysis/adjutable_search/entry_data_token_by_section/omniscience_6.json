    "main_text": "Further Difficulties for Omniscience || Omniscience and Knowledge de re\n4.3 Omniscience and Knowledge de re\nAnother question about omniscience is whether it is really complete knowledge unless it is extended to de re (see the supplement on the de re/de dicto distinction in the entry on propositional attitude reports) knowledge, that is, knowledge with respect to specific individuals that they have certain properties (or with respect to particular pairs of individuals that they stand in certain relations, etc.). This issue has not received much discussion in the literature, but Prior (1962) called attention to it by taking the claim that God is omniscient to entail\n\n(7) For every \\(f\\) and \\(x\\), if \\(f(x)\\) then God knows that \\(f(x)\\).\n\nPrior read (7) as \u201cGod knows everything about everything\u201d but it could be given a more explicitly de re formulation as \u201cevery property and every individual is such that if the individual has the property then God knows of that individual and property that the former has the latter\u201d. Despite the woodenness of the expression, it does seem, as Prior says, that this is a proposition \u201cwhich a believer in God\u2019s omniscience would wish to maintain\u201d. The question then becomes whether (D1) (or (D4)) includes such knowledge de re.\nOf course, if (D1) does not capture de re knowledge, it would be simple enough to add an another clause to it\n\n\u2026 and for every thing x and every property P, if x has P, then x is such that S knows that x has P.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps no such emendation is necessary. Many philosophers have defended an account of de re belief about an object in terms of having some de dicto belief about that object while also bearing a relation of acquaintance to it, that is, while being epistemically en rapport with the object (see Chisholm 1976, Lewis 1979, and Kaplan 1968). Perhaps, God has an immediate or direct awareness of everything and that relation is sufficiently intimate to put him into epistemic rapport with everything. In that case, if de re knowledge is thus reducible to de dicto, then God\u2019s satisfying (D1) (or (D4) would give him complete de re knowledge. On this last point, see Wierenga (2009: 134).\n",
