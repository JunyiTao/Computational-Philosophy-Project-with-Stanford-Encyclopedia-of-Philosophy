The\narticle was entitled \u201cCan Quantum Mechanical Description of\nPhysical Reality Be Considered Complete?\u201d (Einstein et\nal. 1935). Generally referred to as \u201cEPR\u201d, this paper\nquickly became a centerpiece in debates over the interpretation of\nquantum theory, debates that continue today. Ranked by impact, EPR is\namong the top ten of all papers ever published in Physical\nReview journals. Due to its role in the development of quantum\ninformation theory, it is also near the top in their list of currently\n\u201chot\u201c papers. The paper features a striking case where two\nquantum systems interact in such a way as to link both their spatial\ncoordinates in a certain direction and also their linear momenta (in\nthe same direction), even when the systems are widely separated in\nspace. As a result of this \u201centanglement\u201d, determining\neither position or momentum for one system would fix (respectively)\nthe position or the momentum of the other. EPR prove a general lemma\nconnecting such strict correlations between spatially separated\nsystems to the possession of definite values. On that basis they argue\nthat one cannot maintain both an intuitive condition of local action\nand the completeness of the quantum description by means of the wave\nfunction.

Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?\n1.1 Setting and prehistory\n\nBy 1935 conceptual understanding of the quantum theory was dominated\nby Niels Bohr\u2019s ideas concerning complementarity. Those ideas centered\non observation and measurement in the quantum domain. According to\nBohr\u2019s views at that time, observing a quantum object involves an\nuncontrollable physical interaction with a measuring device that\naffects both systems. The picture here is of a tiny object banging\ninto a big apparatus. The effect this produces on the measuring\ninstrument is what issues in the measurement \u201cresult\u201d\nwhich, because it is uncontrollable, can only be predicted\nstatistically. The effect experienced by the quantum object limits\nwhat other quantities can be co-measured with precision. According to\ncomplementarity when we observe the position of an object, we affect\nits momentum uncontrollably. Thus we cannot determine both position\nand momentum precisely. A similar situation arises for the\nsimultaneous determination of energy and time. Thus complementarity\ninvolves a doctrine of uncontrollable physical interaction that,\naccording to Bohr, underwrites the Heisenberg uncertainty relations\nand is also the source of the statistical character of the quantum\ntheory. (See the entries on the\n Copenhagen Interpretation\n and the\n Uncertainty Principle.)\n\nInitially Einstein was enthusiastic about the quantum theory. By 1935,\nhowever, while recognizing the theory\u2019s significant achievements, his\nenthusiasm had given way to disappointment. His reservations were\ntwofold. Firstly, he felt the theory had abdicated the historical task\nof natural science to provide knowledge of significant aspects of\nnature that are independent of observers or their observations.\nInstead the fundamental understanding of the quantum wave function\n(alternatively, the \u201cstate function\u201d, \u201cstate\nvector\u201d, or \u201cpsi-function\u201d) was that it only treated\nthe outcomes of measurements (via probabilities given by the Born\nRule). The theory was simply silent about what, if anything, was\nlikely to be true in the absence of observation. That there could be\nlaws, even probabilistic laws, for finding things if one looks, but no\nlaws of any sort for how things are independently of whether one\nlooks, marked quantum theory as irrealist. Secondly, the quantum\ntheory was essentially statistical. The probabilities built into the\nstate function were fundamental and, unlike the situation in classical\nstatistical mechanics, they were not understood as arising from\nignorance of fine details. In this sense the theory was\nindeterministic. Thus Einstein began to probe how strongly the quantum\ntheory was tied to irrealism and indeterminism.\n\nHe wondered whether it was possible, at least in principle, to ascribe\ncertain properties to a quantum system in the absence of measurement.\nCan we suppose, for instance, that the decay of an atom occurs at a\ndefinite moment in time even though such a definite decay time is not\nimplied by the quantum state function? That is, Einstein began to ask\nwhether the formalism provides a description of quantum systems that\nis complete. Can all physically relevant truths about systems be\nderived from quantum states? One can raise a similar question about a\nlogical formalism: are all logical truths (or semantically valid\nformulas) derivable from the axioms. Completeness, in this sense, was\na central focus for the G\u00f6ttingen school of mathematical logic\nassociated with David Hilbert. (See entry on\n  Hilbert\u2019s Program.)\n Werner Heisenberg, who had attended Hilbert\u2019s lectures, picked up\nthose concerns with questions about the completeness of his own,\nmatrix approach to quantum mechanics. In response, Bohr (and others\nsympathetic to complementarity) made bold claims not just for the\ndescriptive adequacy of the quantum theory but also for its\n\u201cfinality\u201d, claims that enshrined the features of\nirrealism and indeterminism that worried Einstein. (See Beller 1999,\nChapters 4 and 9, on the rhetoric of finality and Ryckman 2017,\nChapter 4, for the connection to Hilbert.) Thus complementarity became\nEinstein\u2019s target for investigation. In particular, Einstein had\nreservations about the uncontrollable physical effects invoked by Bohr\nin the context of measurement interactions, and about their role in\nfixing the interpretation of the wave function. EPR\u2019s focus on\ncompleteness was intended to support those reservations in a\nparticularly dramatic way. \n\nMax Jammer (1974, pp. 166\u2013181) locates the development of the\nEPR paper in Einstein\u2019s reflections on a thought experiment he\nproposed during discussions at the 1930 Solvay conference. (For more\non EPR and Solvay 1930 see Howard, 1990 and Ryckman, 2017, pp.\n118\u2013135.) The experiment imagines a box that contains a clock\nset to time precisely the release (in the box) of a photon with\ndeterminate energy. If this were feasible, it would appear to\nchallenge the unrestricted validity of the Heisenberg uncertainty\nrelation that sets a lower bound on the simultaneous uncertainty of\nenergy and time. (See the entry on the\n Uncertainty Principle\n and also Bohr 1949, who describes the discussions at the 1930\nconference.) The uncertainty relations, understood not just as a\nprohibition on what is co-measurable, but on what is simultaneously\nreal, were a central component in the irrealist interpretation of the\nwave function. Jammer (1974, p. 173) describes how Einstein\u2019s thinking\nabout this experiment, and Bohr\u2019s objections to it, evolved into a\ndifferent photon-in-a-box experiment, one that allows an observer to\ndetermine either the momentum or the position of the photon\nindirectly, while remaining outside, sitting on the box. Jammer\nassociates this with the distant determination of either momentum or\nposition that, we shall see, is at the heart of the EPR paper. Carsten\nHeld (1998) cites a related\n correspondence with Paul Ehrenfest\n from 1932 in which Einstein described an arrangement for the indirect\nmeasurement of a particle of mass m using correlations with a\nphoton established through Compton scattering. Einstein\u2019s reflections\nhere foreshadow the argument of EPR, along with noting some of its\ndifficulties.\n\nThus without an experiment on m it is possible to predict\nfreely, at will, either the momentum or the position\nof m with, in principle, arbitrary precision. This is the\nreason why I feel compelled to ascribe objective reality to\nboth. I grant, however, that it is not logically necessary.\n(Held 1998, p. 90)\n\n\nWhatever their precursors, the ideas that found their way into EPR\nwere discussed in a series of meetings between Einstein and his two\nassistants, Podolsky and Rosen. Podolsky was commissioned to compose\nthe paper and he submitted it to Physical Review in March of\n1935, where it was sent for publication the day after it arrived.\nApparently Einstein never checked Podolsky\u2019s draft before submission.\nHe was not pleased with the result. Upon seeing the published version,\nEinstein complained that it obscured his central concerns.\n\nFor reasons of language this [paper] was written by Podolsky after\nseveral discussions. Still, it did not come out as well as I had\noriginally wanted; rather, the essential thing was, so to speak,\nsmothered by formalism [Gelehrsamkeit]. (Letter from Einstein to Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger, June 19, 1935. In Fine 1996, p. 35.)\n\n\nUnfortunately, without attending to Einstein\u2019s reservations, EPR is\noften cited to evoke the authority of Einstein. Here we will\ndistinguish the argument Podolsky laid out in the text from lines of\nargument that Einstein himself published in articles from 1935 on. We\nwill also consider the argument presented in Bohr\u2019s reply to EPR,\nwhich is possibly the best known version, although it differs from the\nothers in important ways.\n1.2 The argument in the text\n\nThe EPR text is concerned, in the first instance, with the logical\nconnections between two assertions. One asserts that quantum mechanics\nis incomplete. The other asserts that incompatible quantities (those\nwhose operators do not commute, like the x-coordinate of\nposition and linear momentum in direction x) cannot have\nsimultaneous \u201creality\u201d (i.e., simultaneously real values).\nThe authors assert the disjunction of these as a first premise (later\nto be justified): one or another of these must hold. It follows that\nif quantum mechanics were complete (so that the first assertion\nfailed) then the second one would hold; i.e., incompatible quantities\ncannot have real values simultaneously. They take as a second premise\n(also to be justified) that if quantum mechanics were complete, then\nincompatible quantities (in particular coordinates of position and\nmomentum) could indeed have simultaneous, real values. They conclude\nthat quantum mechanics is incomplete. The conclusion certainly follows\nsince otherwise (if the theory were complete) one would have a\ncontradiction over simultaneous values. Nevertheless the argument is\nhighly abstract and formulaic and even at this point in its\ndevelopment one can readily appreciate Einstein\u2019s disappointment.\n\nEPR now proceed to establish the two premises, beginning with a\ndiscussion of the idea of a complete theory. Here they offer only a\nnecessary condition; namely, that for a complete theory \u201cevery\nelement of the physical reality must have a counterpart in the\nphysical theory.\u201d The term \u201celement\u201c may remind one\nof Mach, for whom this was a central, technical term connected to\nsensations. (See the entry on\n Ernst Mach.)\n The use in EPR of elements of reality is also technical but\ndifferent. Although they do not define an \u201celement of physical\nreality\u201d explicitly (and, one might note, the language of\nelements is not part of Einstein\u2019s usage elsewhere), that expression\nis used when referring to the values of physical quantities\n(positions, momenta, and so on) that are determined by an underlying\n\u201creal physical state\u201d. The picture is that quantum systems\nhave real states that assign values to certain quantities. Sometimes\nEPR describe this by saying the quantities in question have\n\u201cdefinite values\u201d, sometimes \u201cthere exists an\nelement of physical reality corresponding to the quantity\u201d.\nSuppose we adapt the simpler terminology and call a quantity on a\nsystem definite if that quantity has a definite value; i.e.,\nif the real state of the system assigns a value (an \u201celement of\nreality\u201d) to the quantity. The relation that associates real\nstates with assignments of values to quantities is functional so that\nwithout a change in the real state there is no change among values\nassigned to quantities. In order to get at the issue of completeness,\na primary question for EPR is to determine when a quantity has a\ndefinite value. For that purpose they offer a minimal sufficient\ncondition (p. 777):\n\nIf, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with\ncertainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a\nphysical quantity, then there exists an element of reality\ncorresponding to that quantity.\n\n\nThis sufficient condition for an \u201celement of reality\u201d is\noften referred to as the EPR\n Criterion of Reality.\n By way of illustration EPR point to those quantities for which the\nquantum state of the system is an eigenstate. It follows from the\nCriterion that at least these quantities have a definite value;\nnamely, the associated eigenvalue, since in an eigenstate the\ncorresponding eigenvalue has probability one, which we can determine\n(predict with certainty) without disturbing the system. In fact,\nmoving from eigenstate to eigenvalue to fix a definite value is the\nonly use of the Criterion in EPR.\n\nWith these terms in place it is easy to show that if, say, the values\nof position and momentum for a quantum system were definite (were\nelements of reality) then the description provided by the wave\nfunction of the system would be incomplete, since no wave function\ncontains counterparts for both elements. Technically, no state\nfunction\u2014even an improper one, like a delta function\u2014is a\nsimultaneous eigenstate for both position and momentum; indeed, joint\nprobabilities for position and momentum are not well-defined in any\nquantum state. Thus they establish the first premise: either quantum\ntheory is incomplete or there can be no simultaneously real\n(\u201cdefinite\u201d) values for incompatible quantities. They now\nneed to show that if quantum mechanics were complete, then\nincompatible quantities could have simultaneous real values, which is\nthe second premise. This, however, is not easily established. Indeed\nwhat EPR proceed to do is odd. Instead of assuming completeness and on\nthat basis deriving that incompatible quantities can have real values\nsimultaneously, they simply set out to derive the latter assertion\nwithout any completeness assumption at all. This\n\u201cderivation\u201d turns out to be the heart of the paper and\nits most controversial part. It attempts to show that in certain\ncircumstances a quantum system can have simultaneous values for\nincompatible quantities (once again, for position and momentum), where\nthese are definite values; that is, they are assigned by the real\nstate of the system, hence are \u201celements of reality\u201d.\n\nThey proceed by sketching an iconic thought experiment whose\nvariations continue to be important and widely discussed. The\nexperiment concerns two quantum systems that are spatially distant\nfrom one another, perhaps quite far apart, but such that the total\nwave function for the pair links both the positions of the systems as\nwell as their linear momenta. In the EPR example the total linear\nmomentum is zero along the x-axis. Thus if the linear\nmomentum of one of the systems (we can call it Albert\u2019s) along the\nx-axis were found to be p, the x-momentum\nof the other system (call it Niels\u2019) would be found to be\n\u2212p. At the same time their positions along x\nare also strictly correlated so that determining the position of one\nsystem on the x-axis allows us to infer the position of the\nother system along x. The paper constructs an explicit wave\nfunction for the combined (Albert+Niels) system that embodies these\nlinks even when the systems are widely separated in space. Although\ncommentators later raised questions about the legitimacy of this wave\nfunction, it does appear to guarantee the required correlations for\nspatially separated systems, at least for a moment (Jammer 1974, pp.\n225\u201338; see also Halvorson 2000). In any case, one can model the\nsame conceptual situation in other cases that are clearly well defined\nquantum mechanically (see\n Section 3.1).\n\nAt this point of the argument (p. 779) EPR make two critical\nassumptions, although they do not call special attention to them. (For\nthe significance of these assumptions in Einstein\u2019s thinking see\nHoward 1985 and also section 5 of the entry on\n Einstein.)\n The first assumption (separability) is that at the time when\nthe systems are separated, maybe quite far apart, each has its own\nreality. In effect, they assume that each system maintains a separate\nidentity characterized by a real physical state, even though each\nsystem is also strictly correlated with the other in respect both to\nmomentum and position. They need this assumption to make sense of\nanother. The second assumption is that of locality. Given\nthat the systems are far apart, locality supposes that \u201cno real\nchange can take place\u201d in one system as a direct consequence of\na measurement made on the other system. They gloss this by saying\n\u201cat the time of measurement the two systems no longer\ninteract.\u201d Note that locality does not require that nothing at\nall about one system can be disturbed directly by a distant\nmeasurement on the other system. Locality only rules out that a\ndistant measurement may directly disturb or change what is counted as\n\u201creal\u201c with respect to a system, a reality that\nseparability guarantees. On the basis of these two assumptions they\nconclude that each system can have definite values (\u201celements of\nreality\u201d) for both position and momentum simultaneously. There\nis no straightforward argument for this in the text. Instead they use\nthese two assumptions to show how one could be led to assign position\nand momentum eigenstates to one system by making measurements on the\nother system, from which the simultaneous attribution of elements of\nreality is supposed to follow. Since this is the central and most\ncontroversial part of the paper, it pays to go slowly here in trying\nto reconstruct an argument on their behalf.\n\nHere is one attempt. (Dickson 2004 analyzes some of the modal\nprinciples involved and suggests one line of argument, which he\ncriticizes. Hooker 1972 is a comprehensive discussion that identifies\nseveral generically different ways to make the case.) Locality affirms\nthat the real state of a system is not affected by distant\nmeasurements. Since the real state determines which quantities are\ndefinite (i.e., have assigned values), the set of definite quantities\nis also not affected by distant measurements. So if by measuring a\ndistant partner we can determine that a certain quantity is definite,\nthen that quantity must have been definite all along. As we have seen,\nthe\n Criterion of Reality\n implies that a quantity is definite if the state of the system is an\neigenstate for that quantity. In the case of the strict correlations\nof EPR, measuring one system triggers a reduction of the joint state\nthat results in an eigenstate for the distant partner. Hence any\nquantity with that eigenstate is definite. For example, since\nmeasuring the momentum of Albert\u2019s system results in a momentum\neigenstate for Niels\u2019, the momentum of Niels\u2019 system is definite.\nLikewise for the position of Niels\u2019 system. Given separability, the\ncombination of locality and the Criterion establish a quite general\nlemma; namely, when quantities on separated systems have strictly\ncorrelated values, those quantities are definite. Thus the strict\ncorrelations between Niels\u2019 system and Albert\u2019s in the EPR situation\nguarantee that both position and momentum are definite; i. e., that\neach system has definite position and momentum simultaneously.\n\nEPR point out that position and momentum cannot be measured\nsimultaneously. So even if each can be shown to be definite in\ndistinct contexts of measurement, can both be definite at the same\ntime? The lemma answers \u201cyes\u201d. What drives the argument is\nlocality, which functions logically to decontextualize the reality of\nNiels\u2019 system from goings on at Albert\u2019s. Accordingly, measurements\nmade on Albert\u2019s system are probative for features corresponding to\nthe real state of Niels\u2019 system but not determinative of them. Thus\neven without measuring Albert\u2019s system, features corresponding to the\nreal state of Niels\u2019 system remain in place. Among those features are\na definite position and a definite momentum for Niels\u2019 system along\nsome particular coordinate direction.\n\nIn the penultimate paragraph of EPR (p. 780) they address the problem\nof getting real values for incompatible quantities simultaneously.\n\nIndeed one would not arrive at our conclusion if one insisted that two\nor more physical quantities can be regarded as simultaneous elements\nof reality only when they can be simultaneously measured or predicted.\n\u2026 This makes the reality [on the second system] depend upon the\nprocess of measurement carried out on the first system, which does not\nin any way disturb the second system. No reasonable definition of\nreality could be expected to permit this.\n\n\nThe unreasonableness to which EPR allude in making \u201cthe reality\n[on the second system] depend upon the process of measurement carried\nout on the first system, which does not in any way disturb the second\nsystem\u201d is just the unreasonableness that would be involved in\nrenouncing locality understood as above. For it is locality that\nenables one to overcome the incompatibility of position and momentum\nmeasurements of Albert\u2019s system by requiring their joint consequences\nfor Niels\u2019 system to be incorporated in a single, stable reality\nthere. If we recall\n Einstein\u2019s acknowledgment to Ehrenfest\n that getting simultaneous position and momentum was \u201cnot\nlogically necessary\u201d, we can see how EPR respond by making it\nbecome necessary once locality is assumed.\n\nHere, then, are the key features of EPR.\n\nEPR is about the interpretation of state vectors (\u201cwave\nfunctions\u201d) and employs the standard state vector reduction\nformalism (von Neumann\u2019s \u201cprojection postulate\u201d).\nThe Criterion of Reality\n affirms that the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenstate of a\nsystem is a value determined by the real physical state of that\nsystem. (This is the Criterion\u2019s only use.)\n(Separability)\n Spatially separated systems have real physical states.\n(Locality)\n If systems are spatially separate, the measurement (or absence of\nmeasurement) of one system does not directly affect the reality that\npertains to the others.\n(EPR Lemma) If quantities on separated systems have strictly\ncorrelated values, those quantities are definite (i.e., have definite\nvalues). This follows from separability, locality and the Criterion.\nNo actual measurements are required.\n(Completeness)\n If the description of systems by state vectors were complete, then\ndefinite values of quantities (values determined by the real state of\na system) could be inferred from a state vector for the system itself\nor from a state vector for a composite of which the system is a\npart.\n In summary, separated systems as described by EPR have definite\nposition and momentum values simultaneously. Since this cannot be\ninferred from any state vector, the quantum mechanical description of\nsystems by means state vectors is incomplete. \n\n\nThe EPR experiment with interacting systems accomplishes a form of\nindirect measurement. The direct measurement of Albert\u2019s system\nyields information about Niels\u2019 system; it tells us what we\nwould find if we were to measure there directly. But it does this\nat-a-distance, without any physical interaction taking place between\nthe two systems.  Thus the thought experiment at the heart of EPR\nundercuts the picture of measurement as necessarily involving a tiny\nobject banging into a large measuring instrument. If we look back at\nEinstein\u2019s reservations about complementarity, we can appreciate\nthat by focusing on an indirect, non-disturbing kind of measurement\nthe EPR argument targets Bohr\u2019s program for explaining central\nconceptual features of the quantum theory. For that program relied on\nuncontrollable interaction with a measuring device as a necessary\nfeature of any measurement in the quantum domain. Nevertheless the\ncumbersome machinery employed in the EPR paper makes it difficult to\nsee what is central. It distracts from rather than focuses on the\nissues. That was Einstein\u2019s complaint about Podolsky\u2019s\ntext in his June 19, 1935 letter to Schr\u00f6dinger.\nSchr\u00f6dinger responded on July 13 reporting reactions to EPR that\nvindicate Einstein\u2019s concerns. With reference to EPR he\nwrote:\n\nI am now having fun and taking your note to its source to provoke the\nmost diverse, clever people: London, Teller, Born, Pauli, Szilard,\nWeyl. The best response so far is from Pauli who at least admits that\nthe use of the word \u201cstate\u201d [\u201cZustand\u201d] for\nthe psi-function is quite disreputable. What I have so far seen by way\nof published reactions is less witty. \u2026 It is as if one person\nsaid, \u201cIt is bitter cold in Chicago\u201d; and another\nanswered, \u201cThat is a fallacy, it is very hot in Florida.\u201d\n(Fine 1996, p. 74)\n\n1.3 Einstein\u2019s versions of the argument\n\nIf the argument developed in EPR has its roots in the 1930 Solvay\nconference, Einstein\u2019s own approach to issues at the heart of EPR has\na history that goes back to the 1927 Solvay conference. (Bacciagaluppi\nand Valentini 2009, pp. 198\u2013202, would even trace it back to\n1909 and the localization of light quanta.) At that 1927 conference\nEinstein made a short presentation during the general discussion\nsession where he focused on problems of interpretation associated with\nthe collapse of the wave function. He imagines a situation where\nelectrons pass through a small hole and are dispersed uniformly in the\ndirection of a screen of photographic film shaped into a large\nhemisphere that surrounds the hole. On the supposition that quantum\ntheory offers a complete account of individual processes then, in the\ncase of localization, why does the whole wave front collapse to just\none single flash point? It is as though at the moment of collapse an\ninstantaneous signal were sent out from the point of collapse to all\nother possible collapse positions telling them not to flash. Thus\nEinstein maintains (Bacciagaluppi and Valentini 2009, p. 488),\n\nthe interpretation, according to which |\u03c8|\u00b2 expresses the\nprobability that this particle is found at a given point,\nassumes an entirely peculiar mechanism of action at a distance, which\nprevents the wave continuously distributed in space from producing an\naction in two places on the screen.\n\n\nOne could see this as a tension between local action and the\ndescription afforded by the wave function, since the wave function\nalone does not specify a unique position on the screen for detecting\nthe particle. Einstein continues,\n\nIn my opinion, one can remove this objection only in the following\nway, that one does not describe the process solely by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger wave, but that at the same time one localizes the\nparticle during propagation.\n\n\nIn fact Einstein himself had tried this very route in May of 1927\nwhere he proposed a way of \u201clocalizing the particle\u201d by\nassociating spatial trajectories and velocities with particle\nsolutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. (See Belousek 1996 and\nHolland 2005; also Ryckman 2017.) Einstein abandoned the project and\nwithdrew the draft from publication, however, after finding that\ncertain intuitive independence conditions were in conflict with the\nproduct wave function used by quantum mechanics to treat the\ncomposition of independent systems. The problem here anticipates the\nmore general issues raised by EPR over separability and composite\nsystems. This proposal was Einstein\u2019s one and only flirtation with the\nintroduction of hidden variables into the quantum theory. In the\nfollowing years he never embraced any proposal of that sort, although\nhe hoped for progress in physics to yield a more complete theory, and\none where the observer did not play a fundamental role. \u201cWe\nbelieve however that such a theory [\u201ca complete description of\nthe physical reality\u201d] is possible\u201d (p. 780). Commentators\nhave often mistaken that remark as indicating Einstein\u2019s predilection\nfor hidden variables. To the contrary, after 1927 Einstein regarded\nthe hidden variables project \u2014 the project of developing a more\ncomplete theory by starting with the existing quantum theory and\nadding things, like trajectories or real states \u2014 an improbable\nroute to that goal. (See, for example, Einstein 1953a.) To improve on\nthe quantum theory, he thought, would require starting afresh with\nquite different fundamental concepts. At Solvay he acknowledges Louis\nde Broglie\u2019s pilot wave investigations as a possible direction to\npursue for a more complete account of individual processes. But then\nhe quickly turns to an alternative way of thinking, one that he\ncontinued to recommend as a better framework for progress, which is\nnot to regard the quantum theory as describing individuals and their\nprocesses at all and, instead, to regard the theory as describing only\nensembles of individuals. Einstein goes on to suggest difficulties for\nany scheme, like de Broglie\u2019s and like quantum theory itself, that\nrequires representations in multi-dimensional configuration space.\nThese are difficulties that might move one further toward regarding\nquantum theory as not aspiring to a description of individual systems\nbut as more amenable to an ensemble (or collective) point of view, and\nhence not a good starting point for building a better, more complete\ntheory. His subsequent elaborations of EPR-like arguments are perhaps\nbest regarded as no-go arguments, showing that the existing\nquantum theory does not lend itself to a sensible realist\ninterpretation via hidden variables. If real states, taken as hidden\nvariables, are added into the existing theory, which is then tailored\nto explain individual events, the result is either an incomplete\ntheory or else a theory that does not respect locality. Hence, new\nconcepts are needed. With respect to EPR, perhaps the most important\nfeature of Einstein\u2019s reflections at Solvay 1927 is his insight that a\nclash between completeness and locality already arises in considering\na single variable (there, position) and does not require an\nincompatible pair, as in EPR.\n\nFollowing the publication of EPR Einstein set about almost immediately\nto provide clear and focused versions of the argument. He began that\nprocess within few weeks of EPR, in the June 19 letter to\nSchr\u00f6dinger, and continued it in an article published the\nfollowing year (Einstein 1936). He returned to this particular form of\nan incompleteness argument in two later publications (Einstein 1948\nand Schilpp 1949). Although these expositions differ in details they\nall employ composite systems as a way of implementing indirect\nmeasurements-at-a-distance. None of Einstein\u2019s accounts contains the\n Criterion of Reality\n nor the tortured EPR argument over when values of a quantity can be\nregarded as \u201celements of reality\u201d. The Criterion and these\n\u201celements\u201d simply drop out. Nor does Einstein engage in\ncalculations, like those of Podolsky, to fix the total wave function\nfor the composite system explicitly. Unlike EPR, none of Einstein\u2019s\narguments makes use of simultaneous values for complementary\nquantities like position and momentum. He does not challenge the\nuncertainty relations. Indeed with respect to assigning eigenstates\nfor a complementary pair he tells Schr\u00f6dinger \u201cist mir\nwurst\u201d\u2014literally, it\u2019s sausage to me; i.e., he couldn\u2019t\ncare less. (Fine 1996, p. 38). These writings probe an incompatibility\nbetween affirming locality and separability, on the one hand, and\ncompleteness in the description of individual systems by means of\nstate functions, on the other. His argument is that we can have at\nmost one of these but never both. He frequently refers to this dilemma\nas a \u201cparadox\u201d.\n\nIn the letter to Schr\u00f6dinger of June 19, Einstein points to a\nsimple argument for the dilemma which, like the argument from the 1927\nSolvay Conference, involves only the measurement of a single variable.\nConsider an interaction between the Albert and Niels systems that\nestablishes a strict correlation between their positions. (We need not\nworry about momentum, or any other quantity.) Consider the evolved\nwave function for the total (Albert+Niels) system when the two systems\nare far apart. Now assume a principle of locality-separability\n(Einstein calls it a Trennungsprinzip\u2014separation\nprinciple): Whether a determinate physical situation holds for Niels\u2019\nsystem (e.g., that a quantity has a particular value) does not depend\non what measurements (if any) are made locally on Albert\u2019s system. If\nwe measure the position of Albert\u2019s system, the strict correlation of\npositions implies that Niels\u2019 system has a certain position. By\nlocality-separability it follows that Niels\u2019 system must already have\nhad that position just before the measurement on Albert\u2019s system. At\nthat time, however, Niels\u2019 system alone does not have a state\nfunction. There is only a state function for the combined system and\nthat total state function does not single out an existing position for\nNiels\u2019 system (i.e., it is not a product one of whose factors is an\neigenstate for the position of Niels\u2019 system). Thus the description of\nNiels\u2019 system afforded by the quantum state function is incomplete. A\ncomplete description would say (definitely yes) if a quantity of\nNiels\u2019 system had a certain value. (Notice that this argument does not\neven depend on the reduction of the total state function for the\ncombined system.) In this formulation of the argument it is clear that\nlocality-separability conflicts with\n the eigenvalue-eigenstate link,\n which holds that a quantity of a system has a value if and only if\nthe state of the system is an eigenstate (or a proper mixture of\neigenstates) of that quantity with that value as eigenvalue. The\n\u201conly if\u201d part of the link would need to be weakened in\norder to interpret quantum state functions as complete descriptions.\n(See the entry on\n Modal Interpretations\n and see Gilton 2016 for a history of the eigenvalue-eigenstate\nlink.)\n\nThis argument rests on the ordinary and intuitive notion of\ncompleteness as not omitting relevant truths. Thus, in the argument,\nthe description given by the state function of a system is judged\nincomplete when it fails to attribute a position to the system in\ncircumstances where the system indeed has a position. Although this\nsimple argument concentrates on what Einstein saw as the essentials,\nstripping away most technical details and distractions, he frequently\nused another argument involving more than one quantity. (It is\nactually buried in the EPR paper, p. 779, and a version also occurs in\nthe June 19, 1935 letter to Schr\u00f6dinger. Harrigan and Spekkens,\n2010 suggest reasons for preferring a many-variables argument.) This\nsecond argument focuses clearly on the interpretation of quantum state\nfunctions in terms of \u201creal states\u201d of a system, and not\non any issues about simultaneous values (real or not) for\ncomplementary quantities. It goes like this.\n\nSuppose, as in EPR, that the interaction between the two systems links\nposition and also linear momentum, and that the systems are far apart.\nAs before, we can measure either the position or the momentum of\nAlbert\u2019s system and, in either case, we can infer (respectively) a\nposition or a momentum for Niels\u2019 system. It follows from the\nreduction of the total state function that, depending on whether we\nmeasure the position or the momentum of Albert\u2019s system, Niels\u2019 system\nwill be left (respectively) either in a position eigenstate or in a\nmomentum eigenstate. Suppose too that separability holds, so that\nNiels\u2019 system has some real physical state of affairs. If locality\nholds as well, then the measurement of Albert\u2019s system does not\ndisturb the assumed \u201creality\u201d for Niels\u2019 system. However,\nthat reality appears to be represented by quite different state\nfunctions, depending on which measurement of Albert\u2019s system one\nchooses to carry out. If we understand a \u201ccomplete\ndescription\u201d to rule out that one and the same physical state\ncan be described by state functions with distinct physical\nimplications, then we can conclude that the quantum mechanical\ndescription is incomplete. Here again we confront a dilemma between\nseparability-locality and completeness. Many years later Einstein put\nit this way (Schilpp 1949, p. 682);\n\n[T]he paradox forces us to relinquish one of the following two\nassertions:\n\n(1) the description by means of the psi-function is complete\n\n(2) the real states of spatially separate objects are independent of\neach other.\n\n\nIt appears that the central point of EPR was to argue that any\ninterpretation of quantum state functions that attributes real\nphysical states to systems faces these alternatives. It also appears\nthat Einstein\u2019s different arguments make use of different notions of\ncompleteness. In the first argument completeness is an ordinary notion\nthat amounts to not leaving out any relevant details. In the second,\ncompleteness is a technical notion which has been dubbed\n\u201cbijective completeness\u201c (Fine 1996 ): no more than one\nquantum state should correspond to a real state. These notions are\nconnected. If completeness fails in the bijective sense, and more than\none quantum state corresponds to some real state, we can argue that\nthe ordinary notion of completeness also fails. For distinct quantum\nstates will differ in the values they assign to certain quantities.\n(For example, the observable corresponding to the projector on a state\ntakes value 1 in one case but not in the other.) Hence each will omit\nsomething that the other affirms, so completeness in the ordinary\nsense will fail. Put differently, ordinary completeness implies\nbijective completeness. (The converse is not true. Even if the\ncorrespondence of quantum states to real states were one-to-one, the\ndescription afforded by a quantum state might still leave out some\nphysically relevant fact about its corresponding real state.) Thus a\ndilemma between locality and \u201ccompleteness\u201c in Einstein\u2019s\nversions of the argument still implicates ordinary completeness. For\nif locality holds, then his two-variable argument shows that bijective\ncompleteness fails, and then completeness in the ordinary sense fails\nas well.\n\nAs we have seen, in framing his own EPR-like arguments for the\nincompleteness of quantum theory, Einstein makes use of\n separability\n and\n locality,\n which are also tacitly assumed in the EPR paper. Using the language\nof \u201cindependent existence\u201c he presents these ideas clearly\nin an article that he sent to Max Born (Einstein 1948). \n\nIt is \u2026 characteristic of \u2026 physical objects that they\nare thought of as arranged in a space-time continuum. An essential\naspect of this arrangement \u2026 is that they lay claim, at a\ncertain time, to an existence independent of one another, provided\nthese objects \u201care situated in different parts of space\u201d.\n\u2026 The following idea characterizes the relative independence of\nobjects (A and B) far apart in space: external influence on A has no\ndirect influence on B. (Born, 1971, pp. 170\u201371)\n\n\nIn the course of his correspondence with Schr\u00f6dinger, however,\nEinstein realized that assumptions about separability and locality\nwere not necessary in order to get the incompleteness conclusion that\nhe was after; i.e., to show that state functions may not provide a\ncomplete description of the real state of affairs with respect to a\nsystem. Separability supposes that there is a real state of affairs\nand locality supposes that one cannot influence it immediately by\nacting at a distance. What Einstein realized was that separability was\nalready part of the ordinary conception of a macroscopic object. This\nsuggested to him that if one looks at the local interaction of a\nmacro-system with a micro-system one could avoid having to assume\neither separability or locality in order to conclude that the quantum\ndescription of the whole was incomplete with respect to its\nmacroscopic part. \n\nThis line of thought evolves and dominates over problems with\ncomposite systems and locality in his last published reflections on\nincompleteness. Instead he focuses on problems with the stability of\nmacro-descriptions in the transition to a classical level from the\nquantum. \n\nthe objective describability of individual macro-systems (description\nof the \u201creal-state\u201d) can not be renounced without the\nphysical picture of the world, so to speak, decomposing into a fog.\n(Einstein 1953b, p. 40. See also Einstein 1953a.)\n\n\nIn the August 8, 1935 letter to Schr\u00f6dinger Einstein says that he\nwill illustrate the problem by means of a \u201ccrude macroscopic\nexample\u201d.\n\nThe system is a substance in chemically unstable equilibrium, perhaps\na charge of gunpowder that, by means of intrinsic forces, can\nspontaneously combust, and where the average life span of the whole\nsetup is a year. In principle this can quite easily be represented\nquantum-mechanically. In the beginning the psi-function characterizes\na reasonably well-defined macroscopic state. But, according to your\nequation [i.e., the Schr\u00f6dinger equation], after the course of a\nyear this is no longer the case. Rather, the psi-function then\ndescribes a sort of blend of not-yet and already-exploded systems.\nThrough no art of interpretation can this psi-function be turned into\nan adequate description of a real state of affairs; in reality there\nis no intermediary between exploded and not-exploded. (Fine 1996, p.\n78)\n\n\nThe point is that after a year either the gunpowder will have\nexploded, or not. (This is the \u201creal state\u201d which in the\nEPR situation requires one to assume separability.) The state\nfunction, however, will have evolved into a complex superposition over\nthese two alternatives. Provided we maintain the eigenvalue-eigenstate\nlink, the quantum description by means of that state function will\nyield neither conclusion, and hence the quantum description is\nincomplete. For a contemporary response to this line of argument, one\nmight look to the program of decoherence. (See\n Decoherence.)\n That program points to interactions with the environment which may\nquickly reduce the likelihood of any interference between the\n\u201cexploded\u201d and the \u201cnot-exploded\u201d branches of\nthe evolved psi-function. Then, breaking the eigenvalue-eigenstate\nlink, decoherence adopts a perspective according to which the (almost)\nnon-interfering branches of the psi-function allow that the gunpowder\nis indeed either exploded or not. Even so, decoherence fails to\nidentify which alternative is actually realized, leaving the quantum\ndescription still incomplete. Such decoherence-based interpretations\nof the psi-function are certainly \u201cartful\u201d, and their\nadequacy is still under debate (see Schlosshauer 2007, especially\nChapter 8).\n\nThe reader may recognize the similarity between Einstein\u2019s\n exploding gunpowder example\n and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat (Schr\u00f6dinger 1935a, p. 812). In the\ncase of the cat an unstable atom is hooked up to a lethal device that,\nafter an hour, is as likely to poison (and kill) the cat as not,\ndepending on whether the atom decays. After an hour the cat is either\nalive or dead, but the quantum state of the whole atom-poison-cat\nsystem at this time is a superposition involving the two possibilities\nand, just as in the case of the gunpowder, is not a complete\ndescription of the situation (life or death) of the cat. The\nsimilarity between the gunpowder and the cat is hardly accidental\nsince Schr\u00f6dinger first produced the cat example in his reply of\nSeptember 19, 1935 to Einstein\u2019s August 8 gunpowder letter. There\nSchr\u00f6dinger says that he has himself constructed \u201can\nexample very similar to your exploding powder keg\u201d, and proceeds\nto outline the cat (Fine 1996, pp. 82\u201383). Although the\n\u201ccat paradox\u201d is usually cited in connection with the\nproblem of quantum measurement (see the relevant section of the entry\non\n Philosophical Issues in Quantum Theory)\n and treated as a paradox separate from EPR, its origin is here as an\nargument for incompleteness that avoids the twin assumptions of\nseparability and locality. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s development of\n\u201centanglement\u201d, the term he introduced for the\ncorrelations that result when quantum systems interact, also began in\nthis correspondence over EPR \u2014 along with a treatment of what he\ncalled quantum \u201csteering\u201d (Schr\u00f6dinger 1935a, 1935b;\nsee\n Quantum Entanglement and Information).\n2. A popular form of the argument: Bohr\u2019s response\n\nThe literature surrounding EPR contains yet another version of the\nargument, a popular version that\u2014unlike any of\nEinstein\u2019s\u2014features the\n Criterion of Reality.\n Assume again an interaction between our two systems linking their\npositions and their linear momenta and suppose that the systems are\nfar apart. If we measure the position of Albert\u2019s system, we can infer\nthat Niels\u2019 system has a corresponding position. We can also predict\nit with certainty, given the result of the position measurement of\nAlbert\u2019s system. Hence, in this version, the Criterion of Reality is\ntaken to imply that the position of Niels\u2019 system constitutes an\nelement of reality. Similarly, if we measure the momentum of Albert\u2019s\nsystem, we can conclude that the momentum of Niels\u2019 system is an\nelement of reality. The argument now concludes that since we can\nchoose freely to measure either position or momentum, it\n\u201cfollows\u201d that both must be elements of reality\nsimultaneously.\n\nOf course no such conclusion follows from our freedom of choice. It is\nnot sufficient to be able to choose at will which quantity to measure;\nfor the conclusion to follow from the Criterion alone one would need\nto be able to measure both quantities at once. This is precisely the\npoint that Einstein recognized in his\n 1932 letter to Ehrenfest\n and that EPR addresses by assuming locality and separability. What is\nstriking about this version is that these principles, central to the\noriginal EPR argument and to the dilemma at the heart of Einstein\u2019s\nversions, are obscured here. Instead this version features the\nCriterion and those \u201celements of reality\u201d. Perhaps the\ndifficulties presented by Podolsky\u2019s text contribute to this reading.\nIn any case, in the physics literature this version is commonly taken\nto represent EPR and usually attributed to Einstein. This reading\ncertainly has a prominent source in terms of which one can understand\nits popularity among physicists; it is Niels Bohr himself.\n\nBy the time of the EPR paper many of the early interpretive battles\nover the quantum theory had been settled, at least to the satisfaction\nof working physicists. Bohr had emerged as the\n\u201cphilosopher\u201d of the new theory and the community of\nquantum theorists, busy with the development and extension of the\ntheory, were content to follow Bohr\u2019s leadership when it came to\nexplaining and defending its conceptual underpinnings (Beller 1999,\nChapter 13). Thus in 1935 the burden fell to Bohr to explain what was\nwrong with the EPR \u201cparadox\u201d. The major article that he\nwrote in discharging this burden (Bohr 1935a) became the canon for how\nto respond to EPR. Unfortunately, Bohr\u2019s summary of EPR in that\narticle, which is the version just above, also became the canon for\nwhat EPR contained by way of argument.\n\nBohr\u2019s response to EPR begins, as do many of his treatments of the\nconceptual issues raised by the quantum theory, with a discussion of\nlimitations on the simultaneous determination of position and\nmomentum. As usual, these are drawn from an analysis of the\npossibilities of measurement if one uses an apparatus consisting of a\ndiaphragm connected to a rigid frame. Bohr emphasizes that the\nquestion is to what extent can we trace the interaction between the\nparticle being measured and the measuring instrument. (See Beller\n1999, Chapter 7 for a detailed analysis and discussion of the\n\u201ctwo voices\u201d contained in Bohr\u2019s account. See too\nBacciagaluppi 2015.) Following the summary of EPR, Bohr (1935a, p.\n700) then focuses on the Criterion of Reality which, he says,\n\u201ccontains an ambiguity as regards the meaning of the expression\n\u2018without in any way disturbing a system\u2019.\u201d Bohr\nagrees that in the indirect measurement of Niels\u2019 system achieved when\none makes a measurement of Albert\u2019s system \u201cthere is no question\nof a mechanical disturbance\u201d of Niels\u2019 system. Still, Bohr\nclaims that a measurement on Albert\u2019s system does involve \u201can\ninfluence on the very conditions which define the possible types of\npredictions regarding the future behavior of [Niels\u2019] system.\u201d\nThe meaning of this claim is not at all clear. Indeed, in revisiting\nEPR fifteen years later, Bohr would comment, \n\nRereading these passages, I am deeply aware of the inefficiency of\nexpression which must have made it very difficult to appreciate the\ntrend of the argumentation (Bohr 1949, p. 234).\n\n\nUnfortunately, Bohr takes no notice there of Einstein\u2019s later versions\nof the argument and merely repeats his earlier response to EPR. In\nthat response, however inefficiently, Bohr appears to be directing\nattention to the fact that when we measure, for example, the position\nof Albert\u2019s system conditions are in place for predicting the position\nof Niels\u2019 system but not its momentum. The opposite would be true in\nmeasuring the momentum of Albert\u2019s system. Thus his \u201cpossible\ntypes of predictions\u201d concerning Niels\u2019 system appear to\ncorrespond to which variable we measure on Albert\u2019s system. Bohr\nproposes then to block the EPR Criterion by counting, say, the\nposition measurement of Albert\u2019s system as an \u201cinfluence\u201d\non the distant system of Niels. If we assume it is an influence that\ndisturbs Niels\u2019 system, then the Criterion could not be used, as in\nBohr\u2019s version of the argument, in producing an element of reality for\nNiels\u2019 system that challenges completeness.\n\nThere are two important things to notice about this response. The\nfirst is this. In conceding that Einstein\u2019s indirect method for\ndetermining, say, the position of Niels\u2019 system does not mechanically\ndisturb that system, Bohr departs from his original program of\ncomplementarity, which was to base the uncertainty relations and the\nstatistical character of quantum theory on uncontrollable physical\ninteractions, interactions that were supposed to arise inevitably\nbetween a measuring instrument and the system being measured. Instead\nBohr now distinguishes between a genuine physical interaction (his\n\u201cmechanical disturbance\u201d) and some other sort of\n\u201cinfluence\u201d on the conditions for specifying (or\n\u201cdefining\u201d) sorts of predictions for the future behavior\nof a system. In emphasizing that there is no question of a robust\ninteraction in the EPR situation, Bohr retreats from his earlier,\nphysically grounded conception of complementarity.\n\nThe second important thing to notice is how Bohr\u2019s response needs to\nbe implemented in order to block the argument of EPR and Einstein\u2019s\nlater arguments that pose a dilemma between principles of locality and\ncompleteness. In these arguments the locality principle makes explicit\nreference to the reality of the unmeasured system: the reality\npertaining to Niels\u2019 system does not depend on what measurements (if\nany) are made locally on Albert\u2019s system. Hence Bohr\u2019s suggestion that\nthose measurements influence conditions for specifying types of\npredictions would not affect the argument unless one includes those\nconditions as part of the reality of Niels\u2019 system. This is exactly\nwhat Bohr goes on to say, \u201cthese conditions constitute an\ninherent element of the description of any phenomena to which the term\n\u2018physical reality\u2019 can be properly attached\u201d (Bohr\n1935a, p. 700). So Bohr\u2019s picture is that these\n\u201cinfluences\u201d, operating directly across any spatial\ndistances, result in different physically real states of Niels\u2019 system\ndepending on the type of measurement made on Albert\u2019s. (Recall EPR\nwarning against just this move.) \n\nThe quantum formalism for interacting systems describes how a\nmeasurement on Albert\u2019s system reduces the composite state and\ndistributes quantum states and associated probabilities to the\ncomponent systems. Here Bohr redescribes that formal reduction using\nEPR\u2019s language of influences and reality. He turns ordinary local\nmeasurements into \u201cinfluences\u201d that automatically change\nphysical reality elsewhere, and at any distance whatsoever. This\ngrounds the quantum formalism in a rather magical ontological\nframework, a move quite out of character for the usually pragmatic\nBohr. In his correspondence over EPR, Schr\u00f6dinger compared ideas\nlike that to ritual magic. \n\nThis assumption arises from the standpoint of the savage, who believes\nthat he can harm his enemy by piercing the enemy\u2019s image with a\nneedle. (Letter to Edward Teller, June 14, 1935, quoted in\nBacciagaluppi 2015)\n\n\nIt is as though EPR\u2019s talk of \u201creality\u201d and its elements\nprovoked Bohr to adopt the position of Moliere\u2019s doctor who, pressed\nto explain why opium is a sedative, invents an inherent dormative\nvirtue, \u201cwhich causes the senses to become drowsy.\u201d\nUsually Bohr sharply deflates any attempt like this to get behind the\nformalism, insisting that \u201cthe appropriate physical\ninterpretation of the symbolic quantum-mechanical formalism amounts\nonly to predictions, of determinate or statistical character\u201d\n(Bohr 1949, p. 238).\n\nCould this portrait of nonlocal influences automatically shaping a\ndistant reality be a by-product of Bohr\u2019s \u201cinefficiency of\nexpression\u201d? Despite Bohr\u2019s seeming tolerance for a breakdown of\nlocality in his response here to EPR, in other places Bohr rejects\nnonlocality in the strongest terms. For example in discussing an\nelectron double slit experiment, which is Bohr\u2019s favorite model for\nillustrating the novel conceptual features of quantum theory, and\nwriting only weeks before the publication of EPR, Bohr argues as\nfollows.\n\nIf we only imagine the possibility that without disturbing the\nphenomena we determine through which hole the electron passes, we\nwould truly find ourselves in irrational territory, for this would put\nus in a situation in which an electron, which might be said to pass\nthrough this hole, would be affected by the circumstance of whether\nthis [other] hole was open or closed; but \u2026 it is completely\nincomprehensible that in its later course [the electron] should let\nitself be influenced by this hole down there being open or shut. (Bohr\n1935b)\n\n\nIt is uncanny how closely Bohr\u2019s language mirrors that of EPR. But\nhere Bohr defends locality and regards the very contemplation of\nnonlocality as \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201ccompletely\nincomprehensible\u201d. Since \u201cthe circumstance of whether this\n[other] hole was open or closed\u201d does affect the possible types\nof predictions regarding the electron\u2019s future behavior, if we expand\nthe concept of the electron\u2019s \u201creality\u201d, as he appears to\nsuggest for EPR, by including such information, we do\n\u201cdisturb\u201d the electron around one hole by opening or\nclosing the other hole. That is, if we give to \u201cdisturb\u201d\nand to \u201creality\u201d the very same sense that Bohr appears to\ngive them when responding to EPR, then we are led to an\n\u201cincomprehensible\u201d nonlocality, and into the territory of\nthe irrational (like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s savage).\n\nThere is another way of trying to understand Bohr\u2019s position.\nAccording to one common reading (see\n Copenhagen Interpretation),\n after EPR Bohr embraced a relational (or contextual) account of\nproperty attribution. On this account to speak of the position, say,\nof a system presupposes that one already has put in place an\nappropriate interaction involving an apparatus for measuring position\n(or at least an appropriate frame of reference for the measurement;\nDickson 2004). Thus \u201cthe position\u201d of the system refers to\na relation between the system and the measuring device (or measurement\nframe). (See\n Relational Quantum Mechanics,\n where a similar idea is developed independently of measurements.) In\nthe EPR context this would seem to imply that before one is set up to\nmeasure the position of Albert\u2019s system, talk of the position of\nNiels\u2019 system is out of place; whereas after one measures the position\nof Albert\u2019s system, talk of the position of Niels\u2019 system is\nappropriate and, indeed, we can then say truly that Niels\u2019 system\n\u201chas\u201d a position. Similar considerations govern momentum\nmeasurements. It follows, then, that local manipulations carried out\non Albert\u2019s system, in a place we may assume to be far removed from\nNiels\u2019 system, can directly affect what is meaningful to say about, as\nwell as factually true of, Niels\u2019 system. Similarly, in the double\nslit arrangement, it would follow that what can be said meaningfully\nand said truly about the position of the electron around the top hole\nwould depend on the context of whether the bottom hole is open or\nshut. One might suggest that such relational actions-at-a-distance are\nharmless ones, perhaps merely \u201csemantic\u201d; like becoming\nthe \u201cbest\u201d at a task when your only competitor\u2014who\nmight be miles away\u2014fails. Note, however, that in the case of\nordinary relational predicates it is not inappropriate (or\n\u201cmeaningless\u201d) to talk about the situation in the absence\nof complete information about the relata. So you might be the best at\na task even if your competitor has not yet tried it, and you are\ndefinitely not an aunt (or uncle) until one of your siblings gives\nbirth. But should we say that an electron is nowhere at all until we\nare set up to measure its position, or would it be inappropriate\n(meaningless?) even to ask? \n\nIf quantum predicates are relational, they are different from many\nordinary relations in that the conditions for the relata are taken as\ncriterial for the application of the term. In this regard one might\ncontrast the relativity of simultaneity with the proposed relativity\nof position. In relativistic physics specifying a world-line fixes a\nframe of reference for attributions of simultaneity to events\nregardless of whether any temporal measurements are being made or\ncontemplated. But in the quantum case, on this proposal, specifying a\nframe of reference for position (say, the laboratory frame) does not\nentitle one to attribute position to a system, unless that frame is\nassociated with actually preparing or completing a measurement of\nposition for that system. To be sure, analyzing predicates in terms of\noccurrent measurement or observation is familiar from neopositivist\napproaches to the language of science; for example, in Percy\nBridgman\u2019s operational analysis of physical terms, where the actual\napplications of test-response pairs constitute criteria for any\nmeaningful use of a term (see\n Theory and Observation in Science ).\n Rudolph Carnap\u2019s later introduction of reduction sentences (see the\nentry on the\n Vienna Circle)\n has a similar character. Still, this positivist reading entails just\nthe sort of nonlocality that Bohr seemed to abhor.\n\nIn the light of all this it is difficult to know whether a coherent\nresponse can be attributed to Bohr reliably that would derail EPR. (In\ndifferent ways, Dickson 2004 and Halvorson and Clifton 2004 make an\nattempt on Bohr\u2019s behalf. These are examined in Whitaker 2004 and Fine\n2007. See also the essays in Faye and Folse 2017.) Bohr may well have\nbeen aware of the difficulty in framing the appropriate concepts\nclearly when, a few years after EPR, he wrote,\n\nThe unaccustomed features of the situation with which we are\nconfronted in quantum theory necessitate the greatest caution as\nregard all questions of terminology. Speaking, as it is often done of\ndisturbing a phenomenon by observation, or even of creating physical\nattributes to objects by measuring processes is liable to be\nconfusing, since all such sentences imply a departure from conventions\nof basic language which even though it can be practical for the sake\nof brevity, can never be unambiguous. (Bohr 1939, p. 320. Quoted in\nSection 3.2 of the entry on the\n Uncertainty Principle.)\n \n3. Development of EPR\n3.1 Spin and The Bohm version\n\nFor about fifteen years following its publication, the EPR paradox was\ndiscussed at the level of a thought experiment whenever the conceptual\ndifficulties of quantum theory became an issue. In 1951 David Bohm, a\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Robert Oppenheimer and then an untenured\nAssistant Professor at Princeton University, published a textbook on\nthe quantum theory in which he took a close look at EPR in order to\ndevelop a response in the spirit of Bohr. Bohm showed how one could\nmirror the conceptual situation in the EPR thought experiment by\nlooking at the dissociation of a diatomic molecule whose total spin\nangular momentum is (and remains) zero; for instance, the dissociation\nof an excited hydrogen molecule into a pair of hydrogen atoms by means\nof a process that does not change an initially zero total angular\nmomentum (Bohm 1951, Sections 22.15\u201322.18). In the Bohm\nexperiment the atomic fragments separate after interaction, flying off\nin different directions freely to separate experimental wings.\nSubsequently, in each wing, measurements are made of spin components\n(which here take the place of position and momentum), whose measured\nvalues would be anti-correlated after dissociation. In the so-called\nsinglet state of the atomic pair, the state after dissociation, if one\natom\u2019s spin is found to be positive with respect to the orientation of\nan axis perpendicular to its flight path, the other atom would be\nfound to have a negative spin with respect to a perpendicular axis\nwith the same orientation. Like the operators for position and\nmomentum, spin operators for different non-orthogonal orientations do\nnot commute. Moreover, in the experiment outlined by Bohm, the atomic\nfragments can move to wings far apart from one another and so become\nappropriate objects for assumptions that restrict the effects of\npurely local actions. Thus Bohm\u2019s experiment mirrors the entangled\ncorrelations in EPR for spatially separated systems, allowing for\nsimilar arguments and conclusions involving locality, separability,\nand completeness. Indeed, a late note of Einstein\u2019s, that may have\nbeen prompted by Bohm\u2019s treatment, contains a very sketchy spin\nversion of the EPR argument \u2013 once again pitting completeness\nagainst locality (\u201cA coupling of distant things is\nexcluded.\u201d Sauer 2007, p. 882). Following Bohm (1951) a paper by\nBohm and Aharonov (1957) went on to outline the machinery for a\nplausible experiment in which entangled spin correlations could be\ntested. It has become customary to refer to experimental arrangements\ninvolving determinations of spin components for spatially separated\nsystems, and to a variety of similar set-ups (especially ones for\nmeasuring photon polarization), as \u201cEPRB\u201d\nexperiments\u2014\u201cB\u201d for Bohm. Because of technical\ndifficulties in creating and monitoring the atomic fragments, however,\nthere seem to have been no immediate attempts to perform a Bohm\nversion of EPR.\n3.2 Bell and beyond\n\nThat was to remain the situation for almost another fifteen years,\nuntil John Bell utilized the EPRB set-up to construct a stunning\nargument, at least as challenging as EPR, but to a different\nconclusion (Bell 1964). Bell considers correlations between\nmeasurement outcomes for systems in separate wings where the\nmeasurement axes of the systems differ by angles set locally. In his\noriginal paper, essentially using the lemma from EPR governing strict\ncorrelations, Bell shows that correlations measured in different runs\nof an EPRB experiment satisfy a system of constraints, known as the\nBell inequalities. Later demonstrations by Bell and others, using\nrelated assumptions, extend this class of inequalities. In certain of\nthese EPRB experiments, however, quantum theory predicts correlations\nthat violate particular Bell inequalities by an experimentally\nsignificant amount. Thus Bell shows (see the entry on\n Bell\u2019s Theorem)\n that the quantum statistics are inconsistent with the given\nassumptions. Prominent among these is an assumption of locality,\nsimilar to the locality assumptions tacitly assumed in EPR and\n(explicitly) in the one-variable and many-variable arguments of\nEinstein. One important difference is that for Einstein locality\nrestricts factors that might influence the (assumed) real physical\nstates of spatially separated systems (separability). For Bell,\nlocality is focused instead on factors that might influence outcomes\nof measurements in experiments where both systems are measured. (See\nFine 1996, Chapter 4.) These differences are not usually attended to\nand Bell\u2019s theorem is often characterized simply as showing that\nquantum theory is nonlocal. Even so, since assumptions other then\nlocality are needed in any derivation of the Bell inequalities\n(roughly, assumptions guaranteeing a classical representation of the\nquantum probabilities; see Fine 1982a, and Malley 2004), one should be\ncautious about singling out locality (in Bell\u2019s sense, or Einstein\u2019s)\nas necessarily in conflict with the quantum theory, or refuted by\nexperiment.\n\nBell\u2019s results have been explored and deepened by various theoretical\ninvestigations and they have stimulated a number of increasingly\nsophisticated and delicate EPRB-type experiments designed to test\nwhether the Bell inequalities hold where quantum theory predicts they\nshould fail. With a few anomalous exceptions, the experiments appear\nto confirm the quantum violations of the inequalities. (Brunner et\nal 2014 is a comprehensive technical review.) The confirmation is\nquantitatively impressive, although not fully conclusive. There are a\nnumber of significant requirements on the experiments whose failures\n(generally downplayed as \u201cloopholes\u201d) allow for models of\nthe experimental data that embody locality (in Bell\u2019s sense),\nso-called local realist models. One family of \u201cloopholes\u201d\n(sampling) arises from possible losses (inefficiency) between emission\nand detection and from the delicate coincidence timing required to\ncompute correlations. All the early experiments to test the Bell\ninequalities were subject to this loophole, so all could be modeled\nlocally and realistically. (The prism and synchronization models in\nFine 1982b are early models of this sort. Larsson 2014 is a general\nreview.) Another \u201cloophole\u201d (locality) concerns whether\nNiels\u2019 system, in one wing, could learn about what measurements are\nset to be performed in Albert\u2019s wing in time to adjust its behavior.\nExperiments insuring locality need to separate the wings and this can\nallow losses or timing glitches that open them to models exploiting\nsampling error. Perversely, experiments to address sampling may\nrequire the wings to be fairly close together, close enough generally,\nit turns out, to allow information sharing and hence local realist\nmodels. There are now a few experiments that claim to close both\nloopholes together. They too have problems. (See Bednorz 2017 for a\ncritical discussion.)\n\nThere is also a third major complication or \u201cloophole\u201d. It\narises from the need to ensure that causal factors affecting\nmeasurement outcomes are not correlated with the choices of\nmeasurement settings. Known as \u201cmeasurement independence\u201d\nor sometimes \u201cfree choice\u201d, it turns out that even\nstatistically small violations of this independence requirement allow\nfor local realism (Putz and Gisin 2016). Since connections between\noutcomes and settings might occur anywhere in the causal past of the\nexperiment, there is really no way to insure measurement independence\ncompletely. Suitably random choices of settings might avoid this\nloophole within the time frame of the experiment, or even extend that\ntime some years into the past. An impressive, recent experiment pushes\nthe time frame back about six hundred years by using the color of\nMilky Way starlight (blue or red photons) to choose the measurement\nsettings. (Handsteiner et al 2017). Of course traveling\nbetween the Milky Way and the detectors in Vienna a lot of starlight\nis lost (over seventy per cent), which leaves the experiment wide open\nto the sampling loophole. Moreover, there is an obvious common cause\nfor settings and outcomes (and all); namely, the big bang. With that\nin mind one might be inclined to dismiss free choice as not serious\neven for a \u201cloophole\u201d. It may seem like an ad hoc\nhypothesis that postulates a cosmic conspiracy on the part of Nature\njust to the save the Bell inequalities. Note, however, that ordinary\ninefficiency can also be modeled locally as a violation of free\nchoice, because an individual measurement that produces no usable\nresult can just as well be regarded as not currently available. Since\ninefficiency is not generally counted as a violation of local\ncausality or a restriction on free will, nor as a conspiracy (well,\nnot a cosmic one), measurement dependence should not be dismissed so\nquickly. Instead, one might see measurement dependent correlations as\nnormal limitations in a system subject to dynamical constraints or\nboundary conditions, and thus use them as clues, along with other\nguideposts, in searching for a covering local theory. (See Weinstein\n2009.)\n\nExperimental tests of the Bell inequalities continue to be refined.\nTheir analysis is delicate, employing sophisticated statistical models\nand simulations. (See Elkouss and Wehner 2016 and Graft 2016.) The\nsignificance of the tests remains a lively area for critical\ndiscussion. Meanwhile the techniques developed in the experiments, and\nrelated ideas for utilizing the entanglement associated with EPRB-type\ninteractions, have become important in their own right. These\ntechniques and ideas, stemming from EPRB and the Bell theorem, have\napplications now being advanced in the field of quantum information\ntheory \u2014 which includes quantum cryptography, teleportation and\ncomputing (see\n Quantum Entanglement and Information).\n\nTo go back to the EPR dilemma between\n locality\n and completeness, it would appear from the Bell theorem that\nEinstein\u2019s preference for locality at the expense of completeness may\nhave fixed on the wrong horn. Even though the Bell theorem does not\nrule out locality conditions conclusively, it should certainly make\none wary of assuming them. On the other hand, since Einstein\u2019s\n exploding gunpowder argument\n (or Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat), along with his later arguments over\nmacro-systems, support incompleteness without assuming locality, one\nshould be wary of adopting the other horn of the dilemma, affirming\nthat the quantum state descriptions are complete and\n\u201ctherefore\u201d that the theory is nonlocal. It may well turn\nout that both horns need to be rejected: that the state functions do\nnot provide a complete description and that the theory is also\nnonlocal (although possibly still separable; see Winsberg and Fine\n2003). There is at least one well-known approach to the quantum theory\nthat makes a choice of this sort, the de Broglie-Bohm approach\n (Bohmian Mechanics).\n Of course it may also be possible to break the EPR argument for the\ndilemma plausibly by questioning some of its other assumptions (e.g.,\n separability,\n the reduction postulate, the\n eigenvalue-eigenstate link,\n or measurement independence). That might free up the remaining\noption, to regard the theory as both local and complete. Perhaps some\nversion of the\n Everett Interpretation\n would come to occupy this branch of the interpretive tree, or perhaps\n Relational Quantum Mechanics.\n \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Bacciagaluppi, G., 2015, \u201cDid Bohr understand EPR?\u201d in\nF.
