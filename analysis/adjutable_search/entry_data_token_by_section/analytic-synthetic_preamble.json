    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cAnalytic\u201d sentences, such as \u201cPediatricians are\ndoctors,\u201d have historically been characterized as ones that are\ntrue by virtue of the meanings of their words alone and/or can be\nknown to be so solely by knowing those meanings. They are contrasted\nwith more usual \u201csynthetic\u201d sentences, such as\n\u201cPediatricians are rich,\u201d (knowledge of) whose truth\ndepends also upon (knowledge of) the worldly fortunes of\npediatricians. Beginning with Frege, many philosophers hoped to show\nthat the truths of logic and mathematics and other apparently a\npriori domains, such as much of philosophy and the foundations of\nscience, could be shown to be analytic by careful \u201cconceptual\nanalysis\u201d of the meanings of crucial words. Analyses of\nphilosophically important terms and concepts, such as \u201cmaterial\nobject,\u201d \u201ccause,\u201d \u201cfreedom,\u201d or\n\u201cknowledge\u201d turned out, however, to be far more\nproblematic than philosophers had anticipated, and some, particularly\nQuine and his followers, began to doubt the reality of the\ndistinction. This in turn led him and others to doubt the factual\ndeterminacy of claims of meaning and translation in general, as well\nas, ultimately, the reality and determinacy of mental states. There\nhave been a number of interesting reactions to this scepticism, in\nphilosophy and linguistics (this latter to be treated in the\nsupplement, Analyticity and Chomskyan Linguistics); but,\nwhile the reality of mental states might be saved, it has yet to be\nshown that appeals to the analytic will ever be able to ground\n\u201canalysis\u201d and the a priori in quite the way that\nphilosophers had hoped.

The mention vs. use of a\nterm will be indicated either by quotation marks or italics, depending\nupon which is most easily readable in the context.)\n",
