As Ernest Partridge wrote, \u201cafter death no events can\nalter a moment of a person's life\u201d (1981, p. 248). The dead may\nbe wronged, Partridge thought, but being wronged is not a kind of\nharm. (The claim that a person may be wronged by actions others take\nafter she is dead is itself quite controversial. Like Partridge, some\ntheorists think that people may be wronged but not harmed\nposthumously. Priorists typically argue that both are possible, while\nother, theorists, such as J.S. Taylor 2012, argue that neither is\npossible.)\n\nWe might also question the possibility of posthumous harm by drawing\non the assumption (made by Mark Bernstein 1998, p. 19, and Walter\nGlannon 2001, p. 138, among others) that something is intrinsically\ngood or bad for a person only if it reduces to her intrinsic,\nnon-relational properties. For simplicity, we can focus on one version\nof this view, namely intrinsic hedonism. Suppose we assume that a\nperson is harmed only by what is intrinsically or extrinsically bad\nfor her, that intrinsic hedonism is the correct account of intrinsic\nharm and comparativism is the correct account of extrinsic harm, and\nalso that the termination thesis (people do not exist while dead) is\ntrue. On these assumptions, it is impossible for an event that occurs\nafter a person dies to be bad for her. It cannot be bad for her in\nitself and it cannot be overall bad for her either. To be overall bad\nfor a person, a posthumous event would have to make her have fewer\ngoods or more evils or both than she would have had if that event had\nnot occurred. But nothing that happens after a person dies and ceases\nto exist has any bearing on the amounts of pleasure or pain in her\nlife. Nothing that occurs after she ceases to exist modifies\nany of her intrinsic properties.\n\nAlthough the above assumptions rule out the possibility of posthumous\nharm, they are entirely consistent, we have seen, with the possibility\nof mortal harm, the possibility that people are harmed by dying. (We\nmight think otherwise if, as some theorists do, we assume that a\nperson no longer exists at the time she dies. Joel Feinberg 1984,\nfollowing Barbara Levenbook 1984, defined death as \u201cthe first\nmoment of the subject\u2019s nonexistence,\u201d which makes death\nsomething that occurs after a person has ceased to exist, and suggests\nthat by ruling out the possibility that a person is harmed by things\nthat occur after she ceases to exist we rule out the possibility of\nmortal harm.)\n",
