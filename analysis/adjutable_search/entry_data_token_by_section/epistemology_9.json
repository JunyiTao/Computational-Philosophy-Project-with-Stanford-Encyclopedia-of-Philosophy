    "main_text": "What is Knowledge? || Knowing Facts\n2.3 Knowing Facts\n\nWhenever a knower (S) knows some fact (p), several\nconditions must obtain. A proposition that S doesn\u2019t even\nbelieve cannot be, or express, a fact that S knows. Therefore,\nknowledge requires\n belief.[14]\n False propositions cannot be, or express, facts, and so cannot be\nknown. Therefore, knowledge requires truth. Finally, S\u2019s\nbeing correct in believing that p might merely be a matter of\nluck. For example, if Hal believes he has a fatal illness, not because\nhe was told so by his doctor, but solely because as a hypochondriac he\ncan\u2019t help believing it, and it turns out that in fact he has a\nfatal illness, Hal\u2019s being right about this is merely\naccidental: a matter of luck (bad luck, in this\n case).[15]\n Therefore, knowledge requires a third element, one that excludes the\naforementioned luck, and so that involves S\u2019s belief\nbeing, in some sense, justifiably or appropriately\nheld. If we take these three conditions on knowledge to be not merely\nnecessary but also sufficient, then: S knows that p if\nand only if p is true and S justifiably believes that\np. According to this account, the three conditions\u2014truth,\nbelief, and justification\u2014are individually necessary and jointly\nsufficient for knowledge of\n facts.[16]\n\nRecall that the justification condition is introduced to ensure that\nS\u2019s belief is not true merely because of luck. But what\nmust justification be, if it can ensure that? It may be thought that\nS\u2019s belief that p is true not merely because of\nluck when it is reasonable or rational, from S\u2019s own\npoint of view, to take p to be true. Or it may be thought that\nS\u2019s belief is true not merely because of luck if that\nbelief has a high objective probability of truth, that is, if it is\nformed or sustained by reliable cognitive processes or faculties. But,\nas we will see in the next section, if justification is understood in\neither of these ways, it cannot ensure against luck.\n\nIt turns out, as Edmund Gettier showed, that there are cases of JTB\nthat are not cases of knowledge. JTB, therefore, is not\nsufficient for knowledge. Cases like that\u2014known as\nGettier\n cases[17]\u2014arise\n because neither the possession of adequate evidence, nor origination\nin reliable faculties, nor the conjunction of these conditions, is\nsufficient for ensuring that a belief is not true merely because of\nluck. Consider the well-known case of barn-facades: Henry drives\nthrough a rural area in which what appear to be barns are, with the\nexception of just one, mere barn facades. From the road Henry is\ndriving on, these facades look exactly like real barns. Henry happens\nto be looking at the one and only real barn in the area and believes\nthat there\u2019s a barn over there. So Henry\u2019s belief is true,\nand furthermore his visual experience makes it reasonable, from his\npoint of view, to hold that belief. Finally, his belief originates in\na reliable cognitive process: normal vision of ordinary, recognizable\nobjects in good lighting. Yet Henry\u2019s belief is true in this\ncase merely because of luck: had Henry noticed one of the barn-facades\ninstead, his belief would have been false. There is, therefore, broad\nagreement among epistemologists that Henry\u2019s belief does not\nqualify as\n knowledge.[18]\n\n\nTo state conditions that are jointly sufficient for knowledge, what\nfurther element must be added to JTB? This is known as the Gettier\nproblem. Some philosophers attempt to solve the Gettier problem\nby adding a fourth condition to the three conditions mentioned above,\nwhile others attempt to solve it by either replacing or refining the\njustification condition. How we understand the contrast between\nreplacing the justification condition and refining it depends, of\ncourse, on how we understand the justification condition itself, which\nis the topic of the next section.\n\nSome philosophers reject the Gettier problem altogether: they reject\nthe aspiration to understand knowledge by trying to add to JTB. Some\nsuch philosophers try to explain knowledge in terms of virtues: they\nsay that to know a fact is for the truth of one\u2019s belief to\nmanifest epistemic virtue (see Zagzebski 1996 and Sosa 1997). Other\nsuch philosophers try to explain knowledge by identifying it as a\ngenus of many familiar species: they say that knowledge is the most\ngeneral factive mental state operator (see Williamson 2002). And still\nother such philosophers try to explain knowledge by explaining its\ndistinctive role in some other activity. According to some, to know a\nfact is for that fact to be a reason for which one can do or think\n something.[19]\n According to others, to know a fact is to be entitled to assert that\nfact (see Unger 1975, Williamson 2002, DeRose 2002 for defenses of\nthis view; see Brown 2008b and 2010 for dissent). According to still\nothers, to know a fact is to be entitled to use it as a premise in\nreasoning (see Hawthorne & Stanley 2008 for defense of this view;\nsee Neta 2009 and Brown 2008a for dissent). And according to still\nothers, to know a fact is to be a trustworthy informant concerning\nwhether that fact obtains. Finally, there are those who think that the\nquestion \u201cwhat is it to know a fact?\u201d is misconceived: the\nverb \u201cto know\u201d does not do the work of denoting anything,\nbut does a different kind of work altogether, for instance, the work\nof assuring one\u2019s listeners concerning some fact or other, or\nthe work of indicating to one\u2019s audience that a particular\nperson is a trustworthy informant concerning some matter (see Lawlor\n2013 for an articulation of the assurance view, and Craig 1990 for an\narticulation of the trustworthy informant view).\n",
