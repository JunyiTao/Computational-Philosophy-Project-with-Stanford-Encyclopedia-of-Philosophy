    "main_text": "Achieving Personhood\n2. Achieving Personhood\n\n\nThe criteria for achieving personhood in Akan society are based on two\nkinds of considerations. The first is the natural fact that we tend to\ncare for our kin and feel responsible for those with whom we are in\nclose reciprocal relationships. The second is that societies need some\nway to encourage and support members' feelings of empathy for\nthose beyond their families.\n\n\nAccording to Wiredu, in Akan society marriage and procreation are a\nnecessary, but not a sufficient condition of personhood. It is\nimportant that an individual's household be administered by a\njoint equal partnership of spouses and that the children are healthy\nand well nourished. If an individual were to take responsibility for\nthe upbringing of distant relatives or were to shoulder the burden of\nrearing non-relatives and allow his household to become a magnet for\nrelatives and extended family, then such an individual will score very\nhigh in personhood, as indicated by references to him as oye\n\u2018nipa, meaning, he is \u201ca real person\u201d indeed.\nAccording to Wiredu,\n\n\nMore than this one is required to make concrete material contributions\nto the well-being of one's lineage, which is quite a sizeable\ngroup of people. A series of events in the lineage, such as marriage,\nbirths, illnesses and deaths, gives rise to urgent obligations. The\nindividual who is able to meet these in a timely and adequate manner\nis the true person (Wiredu & Gyekye 1992, 107 note 2).\n\n\nIndividuals failing to meet these standards attract opprobrium.\nOther members of Akan society will point to them and say\nonnye\u2019 nipa (\u201che is not a real person\u201d). As\na literal rendition from the Akan language, this expression could\nsimply mean that the person is not doing her part.\n\n\nCriteria pertaining to one's relationship to those in the\ncommunity beyond one's immediate family include being an active\nand unstinted participant in community projects (such as building\nbridges, constructing roads, and cleaning public spaces, as well as\nattending to the death, burial and mourning of a deceased member of the\ncommunity). Along with activity in community projects is involvement in\ncivic rituals (such as fellowship associations, rotating credit groups,\nextended family gatherings, secret societies, hunting groups, village\nwatch groups, and civil militia groups) that have face-to-face\nmeetings. Requiring participation in these practices, in effect, solves\nwhat economists refer to as \u201cfree rider\u201d problems by\nallowing information about each person's efforts and\ncontributions to spread quickly through the community. Everyone takes\nmental note of those missing from such events and repeated\nfoot-dragging during community work is rebuked. Although the emphasis\nis on negative scoring, when individuals score very high they receive\ncommunity titles that, on their death, bestows upon them special honors\nfrom other members. These departed individuals are treated as living on\nin a social sense, reincarnated in the ancestral world where they\ncontinue to guard the living. While there is no limit to how high one\ncan rise on the scale that indicates degrees of personhood achieved,\nthere is a limit to how far one can fall.\n\n\nAn adult \u2018do little\u2019 might descend to the level of simply a\nhuman with only the basic dignity and the unconditional rights inherent\nin that status. The fall ends there, because all individuals possess an\nokra which sets a lower bounds on how far they may descend on\nthe scale of personhood. In this sense all humans have moral value that\nentitles them to basic dignity and unconditional rights whether they\nhave attained personhood or not.\n",
