    "main_text": "Perspectives on connexive logic || Empirical perspective\n3.5 Empirical perspective\n\nIn McCall 2012 one can find some results on testing the endorsement of\nconnexive principles (AT\u2032, BT, and BT stated as a rule) given by\nindicative conditionals in English in concrete form on a group of 89\nnon-expert philosophy students at McGill University in Canada. These\nfindings support the intuition that laymen speakers of English\nsubscribe to those connexive principles to a rather high degree: 88%\nin the case of AT\u2032, 85% in the case of BT in rule form, and 84%\nin the case of BT.\n\nEmpirical studies on Aristotle\u2019s theses have been carried out by\nPfeifer (2012), Pfeifer and Tulkki (2017), and Pfeifer and Yama\n(2017). In one experiment, presented in Pfeifer 2012, the sample\nconsisted of 141 psychology students (110 females and 31 males) at the\nUniversity of Salzburg, Austria. Both AT and AT\u2032 were tested as\nabstract as well as concrete indicative conditionals. In a second\nexperiment, 40 students without training in logic (20 females and 20\nmales) had to solve tasks involving concrete indicative conditionals\nin English. In this case, scope ambiguities arising from the negation\nof conditionals were ruled out. Both experiments provide evidence\nagainst the interpretation of indicative conditionals in English as\nBoolean implication and support the connexive reading of negated\nimplications expressed by Aristotle\u2019s theses. Pfeifer sees these\nfindings as strong evidence for interpreting indicative conditionals\nas conditional events. This interpretation predicts that people should\nstrongly believe that Aristotle\u2019s theses are valid because the\nonly coherent assessment for them is the probability value 1.\n\nPfeifer and Tulkki (2017) tested the interpretation of subjunctive\nversus indicative conditionals among a group of 60 students of the\nUniversity of Helsinki, Finland, (30 females and 30 males) and found\nno statistically significant differences between the endorsement of AT\nand AT\u2032 (72%, respectively 77%). Another experiment presented in\nPfeifer and Yama 2017 found no cultural differences between the\nWestern samples and an Eastern sample when testing the endorsement of\nAT and AT\u2032 among 63 Japanese university students from the\nGraduate School of Literature and Human Behavioral Sciences at Osaka\nCity University, with an endorsement of AT and AT\u2032 by 65% and\n76% of the participants, respectively.\n\nKhemlani et al. 2014 report on an experiment testing a sample\nof 21 native English-speaking participants on denying concrete natural\nlanguage conditionals (against the background of Johnson-Laird\u2019s\nmental model theory, assuming classical logic). Whereas 28% of the\nparticipants endorsed denial conditions in accordance with classical\nlogic, 34% endorsed denial conditions according to Boethius\u2019\nthesis BT.\n\nAnother experiment on the negation of indicative conditionals is\npresented in Egr\u00e9 and Politzer 2013. They consider weakenings\nof the classical conjunctive understanding of ~(A \u2192\nB) as (A \u2227 ~B) and the connexive\nreading as (A \u2192 ~B), namely (A \u2227\n\u25ca~B), respectively (A \u2192 \u25ca~B).\nExploiting the flexibility of the \u201ctweaking of the falsity\nconditions\u201d-approach to connexive logic, presented in sections\n3.7 and 4.5, Omori 2019 interprets (A \u2192\n\u25ca~B) in a variant of the modal logic BK\nfrom Odintsov and Wansing 2010 by suitably adjusting the falsity\ncondition for implications (A \u2192 B), so that\n~(A \u2192 B) is provably equivalent with\n(A \u2192 \u25ca~B).\n",
