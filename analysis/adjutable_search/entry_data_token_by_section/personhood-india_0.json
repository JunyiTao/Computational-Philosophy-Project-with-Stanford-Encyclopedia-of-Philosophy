    "main_text": "Classical Indian Conceptions of Persons || Vedic Conception of Persons: Upani\u1e63ads\n1.1 Vedic Conception of Persons: Upani\u1e63ads\n\nHindu philosophical schools develop their philosophical position as an\nattempt to interpret and defend the various metaphysical theses that\nare found in the Vedas (the foundational Hindu scriptures) and more\nspecifically the Upani\u1e63ads. The Upani\u1e63ads, literally\n\u201cthe last chapters, parts of the Veda\u201d, are often thought\nof as expressing the crux or the purpose of the Veda. The concept of\n\u0101tman (soul, self) as the essence of individual persons\nand knowledge of that \u0101tman is the central focus in all of the\nUpanishads. The self (\u0101tman) is primarily conceived of\nin the Upani\u1e63ads as a pure subject of experiences, detached from\nthe objects of its consciousness, enduring and changeless and separate\nand independent of its mental and physical states. In the\nB\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad, the sage\nY\u0101j\u00f1avalkya says\n\n\nThe sages call it the eternal self. It is neither big nor small,\nneither long nor short, neither hot nor cold, neither bright nor dark,\nneither air nor space. It is without attachment, without taste, smell,\nor touch, without eyes, ears, tongue, mouth, breath, or mind, without\nmovement, without limitation, without inside or outside. It consumes\nnothing, and nothing consumes it.\n\nThe Self is the seer, Gargi, though unseen; the hearer, though\nunheard; the thinker, though unthought; the knower, though unknown.\nNothing other than the Self can see, hear, think, or know (BU 3.7, 8,\n11).\n\n\nThis picture of the self as a witnessing subject is in sharp contrast\nwith another Upani\u1e63adic conception: that of persons as agents,\nthe doers and the enjoyers of the fruits of their actions. This\nconception of persons is also found in the\nB\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad:\n\nWhat a man turns out to be depends on how he acts and on how he\nconducts himself. If his actions are good, he will turn into something\ngood. If his actions are bad, he will turn into something bad. A man\nturns into something good by good action and into something bad by bad\naction. And so people say: \u201cA person here consists simply of\ndesire.\u201d A man resolves in accordance with his desire, acts in\naccordance with his resolve, and turns out to be in accordance with\nhis action. (BU 4.4, 5)\n\n\nAnd again, in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad, we find\ntalk of person as an embodied soul. Chapter 5 explains the cycle of\nbirth and rebirth of individual persons as process of soul (self)\nbecoming embodied as a result of being entangled in the material\nqualities (Gu\u1e47as):\n\nOnly he [the person] who gets attached to the pleasurable qualities of\nthings does work for the sake of its fruits, and enjoys the fruits of\nhis own deeds. Though really the master of the senses, he becomes\nbound by Gu\u1e47as, and assuming various forms, wanders\nabout the three paths as a result of his own deeds.\n\n\nBy desire, contact, sight and delusion, the embodied soul assumes\nsuccessively various forms in various places according to his deeds,\njust as the body grows nourished by showers of food and drink.\n\n\nThe embodied soul chooses many forms, gross and subtle, based on the\nqualities belonging to himself, to the actions and to the mind. The\ncause of their combination is found to be still another. (\u015aVU 5.\n7, 10, 11)\n\n\nThe agential conception of persons assumes the Vedic doctrine of\nkarma, so it deserves to a short explication. The doctrine of\nkarma has two dimensions: a moral cosmology and a\npsychological dimension (Phillips 1997, 329). According to the thesis\nof moral cosmology, actions have immediate as well as non-immediate\nconsequences. The latter embody a moral dimension: good actions result\nin rewards, bad actions in punishments in the form of karmic\nresidues which ripen and bear fruit in this lifetime or in future\nlifetimes. According to the psychological thesis, actions create a\ntendency, a disposition to repeat that act. The two dimensions\ntogether might seem to entail fatalism, bad actions result in\nacquisition of bad karmic residues and bad habits that\ndispose the agent to repeat the same offences with the result that the\nagent is doomed to inferior rebirths with no possibility of liberation\nfrom the cycle of birth and rebirth. This impression is mistaken. The\nindividual person is free at all times to break the bad habits and\nperform novel good actions in accordance with duty (dharma)\nand thereby inculcate the right dispositions that incline the agent to\ngood actions and superior births and finally liberation. There is an\nimportant caveat though, \u201cduty has to be performed for the sake\nof duty alone\u201d not because of attachment to pleasures or fruits\nof actions because that results in bondage of the soul to the material\nqualities and many different rebirths follow. The quality of the\ndeeds, good or bad, determines the kind of embodiment (physical and\npsychological characteristics, caste), length of life, quality of\nexperiences, dreams and much else that is to be endured by person\nwhile it is entrapped in the cycle of birth and rebirth. Although the\nsoul is thought of as the controller of the senses, once it is\nembodied, the qualities of material form have the habit of taking over\nand driving individual persons on account of their attachments to\nsensual pleasures. And it is on account of the quality of its actions\nand their karmic fruits, in this birth, that the embodied\nsoul is reborn in (another) new form. The only way out of suffering in\nthe perpetual the cycle of birth and rebirth is knowledge the real\nnature of the individual person and its entanglement in the material\nworld.\n\nThe Upani\u1e63adic philosophers recognize the conception of the self\nas the pure detached subject of experiences separate and unaffected by\nthe material world (niv\u1e5btti) and the person as an\nactive agent engaged with the material world\n(prav\u1e5btti). The niv\u1e5btti tradition is the\nexemplified in the later Upani\u1e63adic renunciant tradition and is\nalso developed by Hindu schools such as the Ved\u0101nta and\nS\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga. In contrast the prav\u1e5btti\ntradition exemplified in the Vedic ritualistic tradition is\ndeveloped by the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 schools. This difference in emphasis is\nalso brought out in the various paths to liberation: the path of\naction (karma yoga) and the path of knowledge\n(j\u00f1\u0101na yoga). The niv\u1e5btti\ntradition stresses the importance of knowledge of the self\n(\u0101tma-vidy\u0101) sometimes equated with mystical\nawareness of Brahman (brahma-vidy\u0101). This, according to\nUpani\u1e63ads, is the most promising route to the supreme good,\nliberation (mok\u1e63a). But it is not exclusive or\nindependent of karma yoga, because knowledge of the self will\nresult in transformation of a person\u2019s attitudes towards sensual\npleasure and earthly goods, and desires which contribute to action.\nAnd conversely, the training in karma yoga together with the\ndoctrine of rebirth and transmigration will result in a transformation\nof how the person views the self.\n\nThe Upani\u1e63adic conception of person is that of an\n\u2018embodied soul\u2019. The soul is essence of the person and it\nis what makes us the same person over time (possibly even across\nlifetimes). The Hindu schools defend what is contemporary philosophers\ncall the Non-Reductionist view of persons. According to the\nNon-Reductionist view, the continued existence of persons is a deep,\nfurther fact, distinct from physical and psychological continuity, and\na fact that holds completely or not at all (Parfit 1984, 445). Parfit\nnotes that a Cartesian Ego, would be one such entity. The soul\n(\u0101tman) as described by the Vedas and explicated by\nHindu would be another. These ideas from the Upani\u1e63ads are\ndeveloped into various conceptions of persons by the Hindu\nphilosophical schools which will be discussed in turn Sections 1.2 and\n1.3 before we turn to unorthodox conceptions in Section 1.4.\n",
