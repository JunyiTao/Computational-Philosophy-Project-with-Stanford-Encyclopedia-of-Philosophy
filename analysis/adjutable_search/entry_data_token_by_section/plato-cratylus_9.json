As the above\nanalysis indicates, the purport of this conclusion is captured by\n (NAT).\n But (NAT) is still a highly abstract claim. It is far from clear what\nit takes to create a linguistic device in a way that guarantees that\nit is suited for picking out a given kind (or the being of its\nmembers); and consequently, it is far from clear how a correct name\nfor a given kind differs from a linguistic device that does not\ndeserve that title. This unclarity makes it very hard to say what\nexactly the tool analogy contributes to Socrates\u2019 investigation.\nOne widespread assumption is that the tool analogy\u2019s conclusion\nis a blueprint for the theory of the correctness of names that\nSocrates elaborates at 390e\u2013427d: that (NAT) anticipates the\nclaim that correct names need to be composed of letters and syllables\nin a way that ensures that they describe or imitate the being of their\nreferents. Champions of both\n Reading A\n and\n Reading B\n are committed to this assumption. That does not mean, however, that\nthey agree in their overall assessment of the tool analogy and its\nconclusion\u2014quite the contrary. Champions of Reading\nA contend that while the analogy between names and tools may\nbe highly suggestive, Plato wants his readers to realize that\ncomparing the introduction of a name for a given kind to the creation\nof a tool for a specific task is ultimately misleading\u2014and to\ndiscard the conclusion that there is a natural correctness of names.\nChampions of Reading B disagree strongly: They assume\nthat Plato wants his readers to accept the argument of the tool\nanalogy and its conclusion.\n\nOne way of dealing with the exceedingly abstract conclusion of the\ntool analogy is thus to construe it as an anticipation of the claim\nthat correct names need to be descriptions or imitations, and to ask\nin a next step whether Plato want his readers to accept this claim.\nBut there is also a radically different approach to the problem at\nhand. Champions of\n Reading C\n take the tool analogy\u2019s conclusion to boil down to the claim\nthat names are correct if they have been assigned to genuine kinds by\nadopting suitable conventions (whereas they are not correct if they\nhave been assigned to gerrymandered classes of things such as, e.g.,\nthe class that comprises all cats and all donkeys and nothing else).\nThey argue that Plato wants his readers to accept this\nclaim\u2014and to see that Socrates is going astray when he moves on\nto elaborate the theory that correct names are descriptions or\nimitations of their referents\u2019 being. It has been objected,\nhowever, that assigning a name to a kind and creating a correct name\nin the sense of\n (NAT)\n seem to be two very different things (Ackrill 1994: 18 f.; Smith\n2014). Whether Reading C\u2019s take on the tool\nanalogy is a viable alternative to\n Reading A\u2019s\n and\n Reading B\u2019s\n interpretation is thus a matter of debate (Mei\u00dfner forthcoming\na).\n",
