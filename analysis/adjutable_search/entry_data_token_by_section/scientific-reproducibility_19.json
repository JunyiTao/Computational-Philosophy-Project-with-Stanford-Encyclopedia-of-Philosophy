    "main_text": "Open Science Reforms: Values, Tone, and Scientific Norms || Values, Tone, and Scientific Norms in Open Science Reform\n4.5 Values, Tone, and Scientific Norms in Open Science Reform\n\nThere has long been philosophical debate about what role values do and\nshould play in science (Churchman 1948; Rudner 1953; Douglas 2016),\nand the reproducibility crisis is intimately connected to questions\nabout the operations of, and interconnections between, such values. In\nparticular, Nosek et al. (2017) argue that there is a tension between truth and\npublishability. More specifically, for reasons discussed in section 2\nabove, the accuracy of scientific results are compromised by the value\nwhich journals place on novel and positive results and, consequently,\nby scientists who value career success to seek to exclusively publish\nsuch results in these journals. Many others in addition to Nosek et\nal. (Hackett 2005; Martin 1992; Sovacool 2008) have taken also take issue\nwith the value which journals and funding bodies have placed on\nnovelty.\n\nSome might interpret the tension as a manifestation of how epistemic\nvalues (such as truth and replicability) can be compromised by\n(arguably) non-epistemic values, such the value of novel, interesting\nor surprising results. Epistemic values are typically taken to be\nvalues that, in the words of Steel \u201cpromote the acquisition of\ntrue beliefs\u201d (2010: 18; see also Goldman 1999). Canonical\nexamples of epistemic values include the predictive accuracy and\ninternal consistency of a theory. Epistemic values are often\ncontrasted with putative non-epistemic or non-cognitive values, which\ninclude ethical or social values like, for example, the novelty of a\ntheory or its ability to improve well-being by lessening power\ninequalities (Longino 1996). Of course, there is no complete consensus\nas to precisely what counts as an epistemic or non-epistemic value\n(Rooney 1992; Longino 1996). Longino, for example, claims that, other\nthings being equal, novelty counts in favour of accepting a theory,\nand convincingly argues that, in some contexts, it can serve as a\n\u201cprotection against unconscious perpetuation of the sexism and\nandrocentrism\u201d in traditional science (1997: 22). However, she\ndoes not discuss novelty specifically in the context of the\nreproducibility crisis.\n\nGiner-Sorolla (2012), however, does discuss novelty in the context of\nthe crisis, and he offers another perspective on its value. He claims\nthat one reason novelty has been used to define what is publishable or\nfundable is that it is relatively easy for researchers to establish\nand for reviewers and editors to detect. Yet, Giner-Sorolla argues,\nnovelty for its own sake perhaps should not be valued, and should in\nfact be recognized as merely an operationalisation of a deeper\nconcept, such as \u201cability to advance the field\u201d (567).\nGiner-Sorolla goes on to point out how such shallow\noperationalisations of important concepts often lead to problems, for\nexample, using statistical significance to measure the importance of\nresults, or measuring the quality of research by how well outcomes fit\nwith experimenters\u2019 prior expectations.\n\nValues are closely connected to discussions about norms in the open\nscience movement. Vazire (2018) and others invoke norms of\nscience\u2014communality, universalism, disinterestedness and\norganised skepticism\u2014in setting the goals for open science,\nnorms originally articulated by Robert Merton (1942). Each such norm\narguably reflects a value which Merton advocated, and each norm may be\nopposed by a counternorm which denotes behaviour that is in conflict\nwith the norm. For example, the norm of communality (which Merton\ncalled \u201ccommunism\u201d) reflects the value of collaboration\nand the common ownership of scientific goods since the norm recommends\nsuch collaboration and common ownership. Advocates of open science see\nsuch norms, and the values which they reflect, as an aim for open\nscience. For example, the norm of communality is reflected in sharing\nand making data open, and in open access publishing. In contrast, the\ncounternorm of secrecy is associated with a closed, for profit\npublishing system (Anderson et al. 2010). Likewise, assessing\nscientific work on its merits upholds the norm of\nuniversalism\u2014that the evaluation of research claims should not\ndepend on the socio-demographic characteristics of the proponents of\nsuch claims. In contrast, assessing work by the age, the status, the\ninstitution or the metrics of the journal it is published in reflects\na counternorm of particularism.\n\nVazire (2018) and others have argued that, at the moment, scientific\npractice is dominated by counternorms and that a move to Mertonian\nnorms is a goal of the open science reform movement. In particular,\nself-interestedness, as opposed to the norm of disinterestedness,\nmotivates p-hacking and other Questionable Research Practices.\nSimilarly, a desire to protect one\u2019s professional reputation\nmotivates resistance to having one\u2019s work replicated by others\n(Vazire 2018). This in turn reinforces a counternorm of organized\ndogmatism rather than organized skepticism which, according to Merton,\ninvolves the \u201ctemporary suspension of judgment and the detached\nscrutiny of beliefs\u201d (Merton, 1973).\n\nAnderson et al.\u2019s (2010) focus groups and surveys of scientists\nsuggest that scientists do want to adhere to Merton\u2019s norms but\nthat the current incentive structure of science makes this difficult.\nChanging the structure of penalty and reward systems within science to\npromote communality, universalism, disinterestedness and organized\nskepticism instead of their counternorms is an ongoing challenge for\nthe open science reform movement. As Pashler and Wagenmakers (2012)\nhave said: \n\n\nreplicability problems will not be so easily overcome, as they reflect\ndeep-seated human biases and well-entrenched incentives that shape the\nbehavior of individuals and institutions. (2012: 529)\n\n\nThe effort to promote such values and norms has generated heated\ncontroversy. Some early responses to the Reproducibility Project:\nPsychology and Many Labs projects were highly critical, not just of\nthe substance of the nature and process of the work. Calls for\nopenness were interpreted as reflecting mistrust, and attempts to\nreplicate others\u2019 work as personal attacks (e.g., Schnail 2014\nin\n Other Internet Resources).\n Nosek, Spies, & Motyl (2012) argue that calls for openness should\nnot be interepreted as mistrust: \n\n\nOpening our research process will make us feel accountable to do our\nbest to get it right; and, if we do not get it right, to increase the\nopportunities for others to detect the problems and correct them.\nOpenness is not needed because we are untrustworthy; it is needed\nbecause we are human. (2012: 626)\n\n\nExchanges related to this have become known as the tone\ndebate.[]\n\n",
