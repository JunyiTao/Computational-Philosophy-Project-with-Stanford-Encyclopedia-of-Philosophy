    "main_text": "Descartes and the Cartesians\n2. Descartes and the Cartesians\n\nA history of consciousness, in its modern sense, properly starts with\nDescartes. While it is true that some ancient and medieval\nphilosophers prefigured some aspects of the modern concept of\nconsciousness (see Hein\u00e4maa, et al. 2007), a significant\nshift took place in the seventeenth century, and starting with\nDescartes in particular, that corresponds with the linguistic shift\ndescribe above. So, it is worth asking what it is about\nDescartes\u2019s project that gave rise to a new way of thinking\nabout conscientia.\n",
