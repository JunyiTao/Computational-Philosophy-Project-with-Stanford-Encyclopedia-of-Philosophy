Logical consequence\n\nTarski presents his theory of logical consequence in Tarski (1936a)\n(German version, Tarski 1936b; English translation of the Polish,\nTarski 2002; English translation of the German, Tarski 1983c). This\nclassic paper begins with some general remarks on the possibility of a\nprecise definition of the concept of consequence. The essence of these\nremarks is that since the common concept is vague, it seems certainly\ndifficult, and perhaps impossible, to reconcile all features of its\nuse in the definition of a corresponding precise concept.\nNevertheless, Tarski says, logicians had thought until recently that\nthey had managed to define a precise concept that coincided exactly in\nextension with the intuitive concept of consequence. Tarski mentions\nthe extraordinary development of mathematical logic in recent decades,\nwhich had shown \u201chow to present mathematical disciplines in the\nshape of formalized deductive theories\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 409).\nIn these theories, consequences are extracted from axioms and theorems\nby rules of inference, \u201csuch as the rules of substitution and\ndetachment\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 410), of a purely syntactical (or\n\u201cstructural\u201d, in Tarski\u2019s word) nature.\n\u201cWhenever a sentence follows from others, it can be obtained\nfrom them\u2014so it was thought\u2014by means of the\ntransformations prescribed by the rules\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 410).\nAccording to Tarski, this belief of the logicians was justified by\n\u201cthe fact that they had actually succeeded in reproducing in the\nshape of formalized proofs all the exact reasonings which had ever\nbeen carried out in mathematics\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 410).\n\nBut Tarski goes on to claim that that belief of the logicians was\nwrong. There are some non-vague cases in which a certain sentence of a\nhigher-order language follows in the intuitive sense from a set of\nother sentences of that language but cannot be derived from them using\nthe accepted axioms and rules. These cases are provided by some\n\u03c9-incomplete theories, theories in which for some predicate\nP the sentences \n\n\nA0. 0 possesses the given property P,\n\nA1. 1 possesses the given property P,\n\n\nand, in general, all sentences of the form\nAn can be proved, but the universal\nsentence\n\nA. Every natural number possesses the given property\nP,\n\ncannot be proved on the basis of the accepted axioms and rules of\ninference. (LGTC provides an example of such a theory.) \u201cYet\nintuitively it seems certain that the universal sentence A\nfollows in the usual sense from the totality of particular sentences\nA0, A1, \u2026,\nAn, \u2026. Provided all these\nsentences are true, the sentence A must also be true\u201d\n(Tarski 1983c, p. 411).\n\nTarski considers the possibility of adding an \u03c9-rule to the\naccepted rules of inference, that is, a rule which allows us to deduce\na universal sentence of the form of A from the set of\nsentences A0, A1, etc.\nHowever, he says that such a rule would differ in very essential\nrespects from the old rules: it is not a finitary rule, while all the\naccepted rules in common deductive systems are finitary. Also, Tarski\nimmediately takes importance away from the further suggestion of\nsupplementing the old system of rules by means of a formalized\nfinitary \u03c9-rule. He points out that in view of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness results, no matter how many new\nfinitary rules or axioms we add to certain higher-order theories, they\nwill still remain incomplete theories, in fact \u03c9-incomplete\ntheories. This discussion is enough to show that \u201cin order to\nobtain the proper concept of consequence, which is close in essentials\nto the common concept, we must resort to quite different methods and\napply quite different conceptual apparatus in defining it\u201d\n(Tarski 1983c, p. 413). The different methods and the different\nconceptual apparatus that Tarski has in mind are going to be\n\u201cthe methods which have been developed in recent years for the\nestablishment of scientific semantics, and the concepts defined with\ntheir aid\u201d (Tarski 1983c, p. 414; a footnote refers us to\nTarski\u2019s monograph on truth).\n\nThe best way of appreciating the nature of Tarski\u2019s theory of\nlogical consequence and how it constitutes an application of the\nmethods of Tarskian semantics is to see how it applies to a particular\nformal language of a simple structure, of a kind that Tarski seems to\nhave primarily in mind in his paper of 1936. We will choose a simple\nlanguage of this kind for a fragment of elementary arithmetic. This\nlanguage, LAr, can be given this quick description:\n\nprimitive signs of LAr: \u2200, \u2192, \u00ac, (, ), x,\n\u2032 (a subindex accent to generate variables\nby suffixing to \u201cx\u201d; let\u2019s use again the\nnotation xn for the x followed\nby n accents), 0 (an individual constant), N (a monadic\npredicate), M (a dyadic predicate).\ngrammar of LAr: Atomic formulae are of the forms\nNt1 and\nMt1t2, where\nt1 and t2 are either variables\nor the constant 0. Complex formulae are obtained by negation,\nconditionalization and universal quantification relativized to\n\u201cN\u201d.\ninterpretation of LAr: The range of the variables is the set of\nall natural numbers. N stands for the set of natural numbers and M for\nthe relation of being less than among natural numbers. The other signs\nmean what you would expect.\n\n\nIn the 1936 paper Tarski seems to be thinking paradigmatically of\nlanguages in which (as in LAr) there is a predicate (\u201cN\u201d\nin the case of LAr) that applies exactly to the individuals in the\ndomain of the intended interpretation of the language. He says\nelsewhere that the variables of such a language range exclusively over\nthe individuals of that set (cf. Tarski 1937, p. 84). (This is not to\nsay that Tarski adopts these conventions with all the languages he\nconsiders. For example, he does not adopt them with languages which,\nlike LGTC, are used to talk about arbitrary individuals, as opposed to\nspecific sets of\n them).[2]\n\nIn the considerations preliminary to the presentation of his theory,\nTarski says that when a sentence X of a formal language\n(e.g., LAr) is a logical consequence of a set K of sentences\nof that language, the argument with premises K and conclusion\nX has the following property, that Tarski calls\n\u201ccondition (F)\u201d:\n\n(F) If, in the sentences of the class K and in the sentence\nX, the constants\u2014apart from purely logical\nconstants\u2014are replaced by any other constants (like signs being\neverywhere replaced by like signs), and if we denote the class of\nsentences thus obtained from K by\n\u201cK\u2032\u201d, and the sentence obtained from\nX by \u201cX\u2032\u201d, then the sentence\nX\u2032 must be true provided only that all sentences of the\nclass K\u2032 are true (Tarski 1983c, p. 415).\n\n\nLet\u2019s clarify the sense of condition (F) with an example.\nConsider a language LAr+ which is like LAr but has besides another\nindividual constant, \u201c2\u201d, and another dyadic predicate,\n\u201cPd\u201d, whose desired interpretations are the number 2 and\nthe relation of being the immediate predecessor of, respectively. Let\nK be the following set of sentences of LAr+:\n{\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acMx0)\u201d,\n\u201cN0\u201d} (these sentences are true); and let X be\nthe sentence \u201c\u00acM00\u201d. The argument with premises\nK and conclusion X is intuitively logically correct;\nthus, according to Tarski, it must verify condition (F). This means\nthat any argument obtained from it by uniform replacement of\nnon-logical constants by non-logical constants must be an argument\nwhere it is not the case that the premises are true and the\nconclusion false. Let\u2019s suppose that the non-logical\nconstants of LAr+ are \u201c0\u201d, \u201cN\u201d,\n\u201cM\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, and \u201cPd\u201d. Replace\n\u201c0\u201d with \u201c2\u201d and \u201cM\u201d with\n\u201cPd\u201d in the argument with premises K and\nconclusion X and call the resulting set of premises and\nconclusion \u201cK\u2032\u201d and\n\u201cX\u2032\u201d. That is, K\u2032 is\n{\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acPdx2)\u201d,\n\u201cN2\u201d} and X\u2032 is \u201c\u00acPd22\u201d. In\nvirtue of condition (F), the argument with premises K\u2032\nand conclusion X\u2032 must be an argument where it is not\nthe case that the premises are true and the conclusion false; and\nthat\u2019s in fact the case: the first premise is false, and the\nsecond premise and the conclusion are true.\n\nTarski wonders if it is possible to offer condition (F) as a\ndefinition of the relation of logical consequence, that is,\nif we can take (F) not only as a necessary but also a sufficient\ncondition for an argument to be an instance of logical consequence.\nHis answer is that we cannot. The reason is that condition (F)\n\nmay in fact be satisfied only because the language we are dealing with\ndoes not possess a sufficient stock of extra-logical constants. The\ncondition (F) could be regarded as sufficient for the sentence\nX to follow from the class K only if the\ndesignations of all possible objects occurred in the language in\nquestion. This assumption, however, is fictitious and can never be\nrealized (Tarski 1983b, pp. 415\u20136).\n\n\nTarski notes that in order for an argument to be an instance of\nlogical consequence it need not be sufficient that all arguments of\nthe same form be arguments where it is not the case that the premises\nare true and the conclusion false. It is conceivable that one may\ninterpret the non-logical constants of the argument by means of\ncertain objects (individuals, sets, etc.) in such a way that the\npremises thus reinterpreted become true and the conclusion becomes\nfalse, and that nevertheless (some of) those objects not be denoted by\nnon-logical constants of the language that is being considered; in\nsuch a case we would not say that the argument is an instance of\nlogical consequence, in spite of the fact that it would satisfy\ncondition (F).\n\nTo give an example, suppose that the language we are considering is\nLAr+. Since both the relation of being less than and the relation of\nbeing the immediate predecessor of are irreflexive over the domain of\nthe natural numbers, the sentence\n\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acMxx)\u201d\nwould be a logical consequence of every set of premises on criterion\n(F): no replacement of the non-logical constants \u201cN\u201d and\n\u201cM\u201d by other non-logical constants of LAr+ turns that\nsentence into a falsehood. But clearly\n\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acMxx)\u201d\nis not a logical consequence of, say, \u201cN0\u201d. This can be\njustified, e.g., keeping fixed the usual interpretation of\n\u201c0\u201d and \u201cN\u201d but observing that \u201cM\u201d\ncan be interpreted by means of the reflexive relation of being less\nthan or equal to; under this interpretation,\n\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acMxx)\u201d\nis false, although \u201cN0\u201d is true. (Tarski\u2019s remark\nthat the supposition that all objects have names in the language can\nnever be realized can be justified, for example, by observing that\nthere are non-denumerably many sets of natural numbers, but in the\nlanguages he considers there are only denumerably many constants.)\n\nTarski\u2019s proposal consists in making tighter the requirement\nexpressed by condition (F), so as to incorporate the idea that a\nlogically correct argument cannot be reinterpreted in such a\nway that the premises become true and the conclusion false; in other\nwords, the idea that a sentence X is a logical consequence of\na set of sentences K when every interpretation on which\nall the sentences of K are true is an interpretation on which X is\ntrue (or, to use a common terminology, when every interpretation\npreserves the truth of the premises in the conclusion). \n\nAs Tarski says, the idea of understanding the notion of logical\nconsequence by means of the notion of truth preservation on all\ninterpretations is not an original idea of his, but one implicit in\nthe logical and mathematical practice of his time (especially among\nmathematicians interested in offering independence proofs). What is\nnew to Tarski\u2019s proposal is that he makes precise the idea using\nthe apparatus he had developed for the mathematical characterization\nof satisfaction and truth. He does not give a detailed example, but it\nseems reasonably clear how he would proceed from the indications he\ngives in (1936a), (1936b) and (1937).\n\nTarski uses a certain precise notion of interpretation for a formal\nlanguage. In our example, an interpretation of LAr is a\nsequence <A, a, R> that assigns\nappropriate objects to the non-logical constants of LAr: a set of\nindividuals A to \u201cN\u201d, an individual a to\n\u201c0\u201d and a binary relation among individuals R to\n\u201cM\u201d. Besides, he always requires that the objects assigned\nby an interpretation to the other non-logical constants of a language\nbe drawn from the set assigned to the non-logical predicate that\nrestricts the range of quantification to a specific set of individuals\n(\u201cN\u201d in the case of LAr) (cf. Tarski 1937, \u00a734); so\nin the case of LAr the individual assigned to \u201c0\u201d must\nbelong to the set assigned to \u201cN\u201d and the relation\nassigned to \u201cM\u201d must be a relation among objects in the\nset assigned to \u201cN\u201d.\n\nTarski introduces the notion of a sentential function. A\nsentential function S\u2032 of a sentence S is the\nresult of uniformly replacing the non-logical constants appearing in\nS with corresponding variables of suitable types (and\ndifferent from the variables already existing in the language). For\nexample, the sentential function determined by the sentence\n\u201c\u2200x(Nx\u2192\u00acMx0)\u201d\nis the expression\n\u201c\u2200x(Px\u2192\u00acYxy)\u201d\n(in which \u201cP\u201d, \u201cY\u201d and\n\u201cy\u201d are new variables). It is equally possible to\ndefine the more general notion of a formula function, in an\nanalogous way, except that now S may be an open formula. The\nsentential functions of sentences of LAr will not in general be\nsentences, and so will not always be either true or false by\nthemselves. But they will always be either true or false with\nrespect to interpretations of LAr; or, as Tarski says, they will\nbe satisfied or not by interpretations of LAr.\n\nThe concept of satisfaction of a sentential function by an\ninterpretation can be defined using the Tarskian method for defining\nsatisfaction. Say that an interpretation <A, a, R> of LAr\nsatisfies the formula function X with respect to a sequence f\n(that assigns values from A to the original variables of LAr)\nif and only if: \n\n(i) X is Pxn (for\nsome n); or X is Py; or (ii)\nX is\nYxnxm\n(for some m and n) and\n<f(xn),f(xm)>\u2208R;\nor X is Yyxn\n(for some n) and\n<a,f(xn)>\u2208R;\nor X is Yxny\n(for some n) and\n<f(xn),a>\u2208R;\nor X is Yyy and\n<a,a>\u2208R; or\nthere is a formula function Y such that X is\n\u00acY and <A, a, R> does\nnot satisfy Y with respect to sequence f; or\nthere are formula functions Y and Z such that\nX is (Y\u2192Z) and either <A,\na, R> does not satisfy Y with respect to\nsequence f or <A, a, R>\nsatisfies Z with respect to sequence f; or,\nfinally,\nthere is a formula function Z and a number n\nsuch that X is\n\u2200xn(Pxn\u2192Z)\nand every sequence g that assigns values from A to\nthe (original) variables of LAr and that differs from f at\nmost in what it assigns to xn is such\nthat <A, a, R> satisfies Z\nwith respect to\n g.[3]\n\n\nThis is a recursive definition, entirely parallel to the definition of\nsatisfaction of formulae by sequences in the definition of\nsatisfaction for LCC in Tarski\u2019s monograph on truth, that we saw\nin section 1 above. In the same way that that definition, the one just\ngiven can be turned into an explicit one by the same method.\n\nThe notion of satisfaction of a sentential function is easy to\ncharacterize in terms of the defined notion of satisfaction of a\nformula function. Say that an interpretation <A,\na, R> satisfies sentential function X if\nand only if <A, a, R> satisfies\nformula function X with respect to every sequence. This\ndefinition is analogous to the Tarskian definition of truth.\n\nIn terms of the defined notion of satisfaction, Tarski introduces the\nnotion of a model of a sentence. A model of a sentence\nS is an interpretation that satisfies the sentential function\nS\u2032 determined by S; more generally, a model of\na set of sentences K is an interpretation that satisfies all\nthe sentential functions determined by sentences of K. And in\nterms of the defined notion of model Tarski proposes his defined\nnotion of logical consequence. A sentence X is a (Tarskian)\nlogical consequence of the sentences in set K if and only if\nevery model of the set K is also a model of sentence\nX (cf. Tarski 1983c, p. 417). Tarski proposes also a defined\nnotion of logical truth (he uses the expression \u201canalytic\ntruth\u201d) using the same apparatus: a sentence S is a\n(Tarskian) logical truth if and only if every interpretation of\nS is a model of S. Analogous notions of Tarskian\nlogical consequence and logical truth can be defined for other\nlanguages using the same method we have followed with LAr, just making\nthe obvious changes.\n\nAfter presenting his definition of logical consequence, Tarski\nimmediately adds that condition (F) can be shown to hold of arguments\nfalling under the defined notion: \n\nit can be proved, on the basis of this definition, that every\nconsequence of true sentences must be true, and also that the\nconsequence relation which holds between given sentences is completely\nindependent of the sense of the extra-logical constants which occur in\nthese sentences. In brief, it can be shown that the condition (F)\nformulated above is necessary if the sentence X is to follow\nfrom the sentences of the class K (Tarski 1983c, p. 417).\n\n\n(The proof that Tarski seems to have in mind is this: suppose that\nX is a Tarskian logical consequence of K; then there\nis no model of K which is not a model of X; so there\nis no substitution instance <K\u2032,\nX\u2032> of <K, X> such that the\nsentences in K\u2032 are true and X\u2032 is\nfalse; for if there was one such, it would readily provide an\ninterpretation\u2014constituted by the extensions of the\nextra-logical constants of <K\u2032,\nX\u2032>\u2014which would constitute a model of\nK that would not be a model of X. But whether this\nis the proof Tarski had in mind is a disputed exegetical\nquestion.)\n\nHence, as was to be desired, if the defined relation of logical\nconsequence holds for a given pair <K, X>,\nthen also condition (F) holds for it. (Although this can be shown, the\nconverse cannot; that is, it cannot be shown that if X and\nK satisfy (F) then X follows from K\naccording to Tarski\u2019s definition. But this is all right, since,\nas Tarski has already pointed out, (F) is not a sufficient condition\nfor the ordinary notion of consequence.)\n",
