    "main_text": "Life, Works, and General Overview\n1. Life, Works, and General Overview\n\nPrice was born in Llangeinor, Wales, the son of a dissenting minister.\nHe was initially educated privately, but after the death of his\nparents was encouraged by an uncle to attend the dissenting academy in\nMoorfields, London. In 1744 Price became family chaplain to George\nStreatfield at Stoke Newington. His duties were not onerous, leaving\nhim ample time for study. It was here that he began what became his\nmost important work: A Review of the Principal Questions in\nMorals (1758; 3rd. ed. 1787). In its main doctrines\nPrice was strongly influenced by Ralph Cudworth, whose Treatise\nConcerning Eternal and Immutable Morality was published\nposthumously in 1731. In 1757 Streatfield died and, his financial\ncircumstances having improved, Price married Sarah Blundell in June of\nthat year and became, shortly after, the minister in Newington Green,\nwhere he remained for most of his life.\n\nPrice became a leading figure in liberal intellectual groups,\nespecially the \u201cBowood Circle\u201d, which was named after the\nhouse of its leader, Lord Shelburne, and included Joseph Priestley and\nBenjamin Vaughan. He also belonged to the group that Benjamin Franklin\ndubbed the \u201cClub of Honest Whigs\u201d: a dining group\nrevolving round John Canton, which included some other members of the\nBowood Circle. Other prominent visitors or acquaintances included the\neminent politicians, Lord Stanhope, William Pitt the Elder, and the\nprison reformer John Howard, as well as David Hume, and Adam\nSmith.\n\nPrice was a keen supporter of both the American and French\nrevolutions. In early 1776 he published Observations on the Nature\nof Civil Liberty, followed by Additional Observations in\nthe next year. In 1784 he added Observations on the Importance of\nthe American Revolution. Price\u2019s support of the colonies\nearned him the friendship of many of the leading figures in the\nrebellion, including Franklin, Jefferson, Adams, and Paine. His\nsupport led to his being invited by the Continental Congress to assist\nin the financial administration of the States, and to his being\nawarded an honorary LL.D. by Yale University (1781, the other honoree\nthat year being George Washington), to add to the honorary doctorates\nhe had already received from Aberdeen and Glasgow Universities. When\nLord Shelburne became Prime Minister in 1782 he offered Price the post\nof his private secretary, which Price refused.\n\nHis published sermon, A Discourse on the Love of our Country\n(1789), defending the French revolution, ignited a pamphlet war,\nincluding Burke\u2019s famous and furious response in Reflections\non the Revolution in France (1790), as well as equally passionate\ndefenses by his friends Thomas Paine in Rights of Man (1791),\nand Mary Wollstonecraft in A Vindication of the Rights of Men\n(1790).\n\nA central aspect of Price\u2019s dissension from the doctrines of the\nChurch of England was his rejection of Trinitarianism. For the\nTrinitarian, the Godhead is three persons in one substance, so that\nChrist is fully God as well as fully man. For the Socinian, by\ncontrast, Jesus is merely human: a supreme teacher and exemplar of how\nto live, but nothing more. Price takes a position between these\nextremes. Christ is creator and judge, who descended from heaven and\nbecame man. He is not God, but the Messiah, and is on no account to be\nworshipped. When it comes to Christ\u2019s redemptive power, Price\nagain steers a middle course between the Socinian view that Christ\nsaves by precept and example, so that his death was not necessary to\nsalvation, and the Calvinist claim that redemption is wholly the work\nof God, who saves whom he will save, and damns whom he will damn (see\nRomans 9:18). For Price, salvation requires the cooperation\nof both parties. The sinner must of his own free will repent and\nstrive for righteousness, but God is not required to accept\nrepentant sinners, for repentance does not wipe out the consequences\nof sin. God wipes out all guilt as a reward to Christ for his perfect\nobedience.\n\nIn line with Cudworth, Clarke, and many others, Price rejected\ntheological voluntarism: the view that the precepts of morality depend\non God\u2019s will. The fundamental principles of morality are\nnecessary, and thus eternal and immutable. The standard objection to\nthis view is that it limits the sovereignty of God by making him\nsubject to moral demands that are not dependent on him. Price\u2019s\nresponse to this difficulty lies in his claim that, since God\nis eternal truth and reason, and since reason must recognize\nmoral obligations, moral constraints are part of God\u2019s nature,\nand not distinct from it. Nothing external to God constrains him.\n\nIn addition to his writings on ethics, theology, and politics, Price\ncorresponded at length with Joseph Priestley on the topic of free\nwill; their correspondence was published in 1778. He was also a\npioneer in probability theory, and edited Thomas Bayes\u2019 major\nwork An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of\nChances (1763). As a consequence of his important introduction to\nBayes\u2019 essay he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in\n1765. His statistical work led to an interest in demography and\nactuarial calculations. His foundational book, Observations on\nReversionary Payments (1771) was in use for about a century, as\nwas his life table compiled by data he drew from a study of\nNorthampton. His Essay on the Population of England\n(2nd ed. 1780) influenced Thomas Malthus. His concern about\nthe failure of successive governments to tackle the mounting national\ndebt led to his publication, in the same year, of his Appeal to\nthe Public on the Subject of the National Debt (1771), which may\nhave influenced William Pitt the Younger to re-establish the sinking\nfund for the extinction of the national debt.\n\nIt is Price\u2019s views on ethics that remain most relevant to\ncontemporary philosophy, so that will be the central focus of this\nentry, which will also cover his political theory, theology, and\nhis position on free will.\n",
