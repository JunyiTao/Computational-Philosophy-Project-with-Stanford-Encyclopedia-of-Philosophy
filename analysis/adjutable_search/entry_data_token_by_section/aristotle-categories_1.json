    "main_text": "The Four-Fold Division || Not Said-Of and Not Present-In\n1.1 Not Said-Of and Not Present-In\n\nThe pride of place in this classificatory scheme, according to\nAristotle, goes to those entities that are neither said-of nor\npresent-in anything. Such entities, Aristotle says, are primary\nsubstances (2a11). Although he only gives a negative characterization\nof primary substances in the Categories \u2014 they are\nneither said-of nor present-in \u2014 the examples\nof them that he provides allow us to form a more robust conception of\nwhat a primary substance is supposed to be. His favorite examples are\nan individual man and a horse (1a20, 2a11). So, it is natural to\ninterpret him as thinking that among primary substances are concrete\nparticulars that are members of natural kinds. Whether in the\nCategories Aristotle intended to restrict the class of\nprimary substances to just members of natural kinds turns out to be\namong the more controversial topics in Aristotle scholarship. But at\nthe very least, he seems to think that members of natural kinds\npresent enough of a paradigmatic case that he can use them as\nexamples.\n\nNow, given the above interpretation of the said-of and present-in\nrelation, a primary substance is a particular that is non-accidental.\nIt must be admitted that it is difficult to say exactly what it means\nto say that a particular is non-accidental. In highlighting the fact\nthat primary substances are not the sorts of beings that can be\naccidents, Aristotle seems to be indicating both that they are not\npredicated of anything accidentally and that they are not entities\nthat are manifestly temporary, accidentally characterized, or\nartificially unified, such as Socrates-seated-in-a-chair. Similarly,\nby treating them as not said-of anything, Aristotle draws attention to\nthe fact that primary substances are not predicated of anything\neither. Rather, they are themselves essential unities, and indeed not\npredicable at all. Beyond these few remarks, however, it is difficult\nto say exactly, given only what is made explicit in the\nPre-predicamenta what a primary substance is. But this, one might\nargue, is appropriate for a metaphysically fundamental entity \u2014\nwe can say of it what it is not, but because it is so basic, we lack\nthe vocabulary to say in an informative way what it is. And indeed,\nAristotle thinks that primary substances are fundamental in this way\nsince he thinks that all other entities bear some type of asymmetric\ndependence relation to primary substances (2a34\u20132b6).\n",
