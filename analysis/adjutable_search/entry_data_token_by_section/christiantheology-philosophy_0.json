    "main_text": "The Relationship Between Philosophy and Theology in the Christian Tradition\n1. The Relationship Between Philosophy and Theology in the Christian Tradition\n\nAlthough modern thought tends to assume a sharp disjunction between\nphilosophy and theology, it is not at all obvious how to distinguish\nthem in a principled way. Suppose that we take philosophy in the\nbroadest sense to be the systematic use of human reason in an effort\nto understand the most fundamental features of reality, and suppose\nthat we take theology in the broadest sense to be the study of God and\nall things in relation to God. Then we should expect to see\nconsiderable overlap between the two: after all, God, if there is a\nGod, is surely one of the fundamental features of reality, and one to\nwhich all the other features presumably relate.\n\nIn practice, when we survey the history of Christian thought, we do\nsee considerable overlap between philosophy and theology. With respect\nto their topics of inquiry, philosophers and theologians\nalike ask questions about epistemology, axiology, and political\ntheory, as well as about metaphysics and fundamental ontology.\nSimilarly, with respect to their methods of inquiry,\nphilosophers and theologians alike interpret authoritative texts,\ndeploy arguments, and marshal evidence to support their conclusions.\nHere one might insist that Christian theological claims are grounded\nby appeals to \u201cfaith\u201d or \u201cauthority\u201d, whereas\nphilosophical claims are grounded by appeals to \u201creason\u201d.\nThis contrast is promising when suitably developed, but it is not as\nsharp as one might initially suppose. Theology also makes appeals to\ncommon sense and ordinary human reason, and philosophy also has its\nversions of faith and authority.\n\nOf the making of typologies there is no end, but it is still worth\nexamining some of the most common ways that Christian thinkers\nthroughout the centuries have understood the relationship between\nphilosophy and theology. Without this historical background, it\nbecomes all-too-easy to draw the relationship in na\u00efve,\nanachronistic, and overly simplistic ways. In fact, no single\ninterpretation of the relationship between philosophy and theology can\nclaim overwhelming support from the Christian tradition. From outside\nthe Christian tradition, while many non-Christian thinkers see\nphilosophy and theology as quite distinct, others deliberately blur\nthe distinction between them\u2014because they think that theology is\nactually just misguided philosophy.\n\nAt the top-level of the proposed typology, we can distinguish between\n\u201cIntegration\u201d and \u201cContrast\u201d views.\nIntegration views do not distinguish philosophy and theology at all,\nwhereas Contrast views do. We can disambiguate the\n\u201cContrast\u201d category into \u201cCooperation\u201d views,\n\u201cDisjunction\u201d views, and \u201cConflict\u201d views. The\nmost prominent Cooperation views treat philosophy as a valuable,\nperhaps even necessary, tool for theological inquiry, and still allow\nsome degree of overlap between the two. Disjunction views, by\ncontrast, regard philosophy and theology as non-overlapping forms of\ninquiry, which feature distinct and ultimately unrelated goals and\nmethods. \u201cConflict\u201d views treat philosophy and theology as\nnot only distinct but mutually antagonistic. In fact, however, few\nChristian thinkers have endorsed outright conflict between philosophy\nand theology. But it is still worth discussing the Conflict view\nexplicitly, because some prominent Christian theologians throughout\nhistory\u2014for example, Tertullian, Martin Luther, or Karl\nBarth\u2014initially seem to advocate Conflict. Upon closer\ninspection, however, their views are closer to those in the\nDisjunction category.\n\nThese categories are crude. They could each be further divided, and\nsubdivided again. They focus mainly on different Christian\nattitudes toward the interaction of philosophy and theology, rather\nthan on the attitudes of non-Christian philosophers. Some non-empty\ncategories are omitted altogether. But these categories do capture\nmuch of the landscape, and at least show that there are more options\navailable than a na\u00efve conflict between faith and reason.\n",
