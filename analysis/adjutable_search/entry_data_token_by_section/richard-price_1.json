    "main_text": "Price\u2019s Moral Philosophy || Overview\n2.1 Overview\n\nPrice can be classified as an Ethical Intuitionist in two respects.\nFirst, he rejects empiricism about our acquisition of knowledge, and\nespouses an intuitionist epistemology in ethics. Empiricists are\nmistaken in thinking that all knowledge has its basis in experience.\nThere are a number of substantial necessary truths, essential to\nrational thought, which cannot be established by empirical methods,\nbut which are self-evident. Reflection on them is sufficient to\nestablish their truth. These include, as well as some mathematical and\nmetaphysical truths, a number of fundamental moral principles.\n\nEmpiricism is also mistaken in its account of concept acquisition.\nThere are certain simple concepts that cannot be acquired by\nabstraction from sensory data or from reflecting on the mind\u2019s\nown operations. Among these are the basic concepts of ethics denoted\nby words such as: \u201cright\u201d, \u201cwrong\u201d,\n\u201cgood\u201d, \u201cbad\u201d, \u201cobligation\u201d. While\nnothing in experience itself answers to these concepts, they can be\ngrasped and applied correctly by the understanding to pick out genuine\nproperties of agents and actions. Since we possess these moral\nconcepts, which cannot arise in the ways that empiricists allow, the\nempiricism to which Locke and Hume subscribe must be false.\n\nAre these sufficient grounds for rejecting empiricism as a\nmethodology? If moral concepts were alone in presenting a difficultly\nfor empiricism, then there might be grounds for maintaining that\nepistemology, and either denying that there are moral concepts, or at\nleast denying that we have moral knowledge. Price\u2019s main\nargument against empiricism about concept acquisition consists in\nfinding what Mackie later called companions in guilt; i.e., other\nconcepts which are indispensable, and which we happily use, that\ncannot be explained on empiricist epistemology of this sort.\nPrice\u2019s rather familiar examples include: solidity, substance,\npower, cause, duration, inertia, infinity, number, identity, equality,\nand all modal concepts. If empiricists are successfully to defend\ntheir methodology they must either show that the concepts in question\ncan be explained on their epistemology, or bite the bullet and deny\nthat we do have any clear understanding of concepts like these or, at\nleast, that our ideas about such matters are confused or misleading.\nFor Price, by contrast, it is the understanding (a branch of\nreason), and not sense experience, that is the source of such\nconcepts.\n\nPrice is also an Intuitionist in a second and quite different sense in\nthat he embraces pluralism about basic duties. Those of a utilitarian\npersuasion held that all our duties were founded in one fundamental\nduty: to be benevolent, in the sense of promoting the well-being of\nall parties impartially. Price denies this. He contends, first, that\nwe have a duty to give preference to the welfare of some rather than\nothers; second, that there are duties that are quite distinct from\nbenevolence. On the first count, we have positional duties to God, to\nourselves, and to those with whom we have a special relationship. On\nthe second, there are some duties, such as gratitude, veracity, and\njustice, which are quite distinct from benevolence. Indeed, Price\nclaims, our duties to God do not even include benevolence; it does not\nmake sense to suppose we can benefit God, or increase his\nhappiness, by our obedience and worship.\n\nPrice recognizes that our various duties may conflict in a particular\ncase: the only way to prevent harm may be to lie; acting justly may be\nimprudent, and so on. He maintains that in some cases one duty is\nclearly weightier than another and no perplexity arises. But there are\nmany cases where it is not clear what is the right thing to do, and\nconscientious people may differ as to which duty should give way in\nsuch cases. There is always a determinate answer to the question of\nwhich action is right, but as finite creatures we may lack penetration\nand wisdom to discern it. Doubt about what we should do in a\nparticular case should not, however, infect our confidence in the\nexistence of objective moral truth, for the fundamental principles\nthat we bring to bear on particular cases are self-evident.\n\nThese claims have been made familiar in more recent times by W. D.\nRoss, and consequently much debated, so the focus in what follows will\nbe on what is peculiar to Price\u2019s views.\n",
