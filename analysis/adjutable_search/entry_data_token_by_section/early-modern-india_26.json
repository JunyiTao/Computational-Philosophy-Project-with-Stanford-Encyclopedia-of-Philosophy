This states that the inferred property\nS pervades the reason property H just in case there\nis no place/entity where H is located but S is\nabsent. Formally:\n\nV1\nPervades (S, H) iff\n    \u00ac(\u2203x)(Hx &\n    S\u2032x).\n\n\nwhere S\u2032 is used to denote the complement of\nS. This definition is traceable both to the early Ny\u0101ya\nnotion of a \u2018deviating\u2019 pseudo-reason (i.e. one which\noccurs somewhere where the inferable property S is absent),\nand to Di\u1e45n\u0101ga\u2019s \u2018triple-condition\u2019\ntheory of the inferential sign, his third condition being that H must\nnot be located in any \u201cdisagreeing case\u201d (cf.\n\u2018vipak\u1e63a\u2019), i.e. a place where S\nis absent. In either case, the intuition is that a relation expressed\nby \u201cwhere there is smoke there is fire\u201d obtains just in\ncase there is no place where fire is absent but smoke is present, i.e.\nno counter-example. The first definition which Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nconsiders is of just this form. It is that S pervades\nH iff H has \u201cnon-occurrence in the loci of\nabsence of S\u201d\n(s\u0101dhy\u0101bh\u0101vavad-av\u1e5bttitvam), i.e.\nV1.\n\nWhy is this plausible-seeming interpretation of the notion of\npervasion rejected in Navya-Ny\u0101ya? There are two reasons:\n\nThe Problem of Partially Locatable Properties. The first\nproblem with the \u2018no counter-example\u2019 definition depends\non the Navya-ny\u0101ya notion of partial location\n(avy\u0101pya-v\u1e5btti). A property is said to occur\nwholly or completely in an object if it occurs in every part of that\nobject. For example, the property of being golden occurs completely in\na piece of (pure) gold; the object is \u2018saturated\u2019\n(abhivy\u0101pya) by the property, just as sesame oil\nsaturates a sesame seed. Some properties, however, occur in some parts\nof the object but not others\u2014these are called \u201cpartially\nlocatable\u201d. For example, the property of being molten occurs at\nthe centre of the Earth but not at the periphery. Note that the same\nproperty can be wholly located in some loci and partially located in\nothers\u2014e.g. redness occurs wholly in a ruby but partially in a\nred snooker ball. The distinction concerns two modes of\nproperty-possession, not two types of property. An important point is\nthat, if a property is partially located in an object, then so is its\nnegation. The Naiy\u0101yikas\u2019 standard example of a partially\nlocatable property, viz. \u201c\u2026is in contact with a\nmonkey\u201d (kapi-samyoga), illustrates the point. If the\nmonkey is sitting on a branch of a tree, then the following statements\nmay be true:\n\nThe tree is in-contact-with-the-monkey at time t,\nand\nThe tree is not-in-contact-with-the-monkey at time\nt,\n\n\n(2) being true because there are parts of the tree with which the\nmonkey is not in contact. Ny\u0101ya avoids the threatened violation\nof the law of non-contradiction by relativising the notion of\noccurrence. (1) is thus analysed as \u201cthe occurrence, of the\nproperty being-in-contact-with-the-monkey in the tree, is\ndelimited by (avacchinna) the branch\u201d. Since a different\ndelimitor appears in (2), there is no inconsistency between the two\nstatements.\n\nThe main effect of admitting partially located properties into the\nsystem is that it is no longer the case that a property, P,\nand its complement, P\u2032, are disjoint: they may now\nintersect. If the inferred property is partially located, then the\nclass of \u201cagreeing cases\u201d (sapak\u1e63as -\nplaces where the inferred property is present) and the class of\n\u201cdisagreeing cases\u201d (vipak\u1e63as\u2014places\nwhere the inferred property is absent) overlap rather than being\ndistinct classes. To put it another way, a property P should\nbe thought of as having both a \u201cpresence range\u201d\n(P+) and an \u201cabsence range\u201d (P\u2212),\nand the two may overlap. Consider now the standard inference\n\u201cThe mountain has fire, because it has smoke\u201d. Suppose we\nfind a place where smoke is present, and fire is both absent and also\npresent, e.g. the kitchen. Does this show the inference to be faulty?\nAccording to definition V1, it does, because the kitchen\nwill be a counter-example, a place where smoke is present and fire\nabsent. But this is wrong: since fire is also present there, it is not\na real counter-example to the rule \u201cwhere there is smoke there\nis fire\u201d. The upshot is that we must examine the \u201cpresence\nranges\u201d of the reason property and inferred properties, not\ntheir \u201cabsence ranges\u201d. A real counter-example to rule is\na case which is in the presence-range of the reason property but not\nin the presence range of the inferred property.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s second definition is designed to solve this\nproblem: H\u2019s \u201cnon-occurrence in the loci of\nabsence of S which are different from locus of\nS\u201d. In other words, a locus of absence of S\nwhich is also not a locus of S should not be a locus of\nH:\n\nV2\nPervades (S, H) iff\n      \u00ac(\u2203x)(Hx &\n      S\u2032x & \u00acSx).\n\n\nThe effect of the new clause is precisely to rule out the problem of\npartially locatable properties, by specifying more restrictively what\nconstitutes a counter-example.\n\nThe Problem of Universally Positive Inference. There are,\nclaim the Ny\u0101ya, patterns of legitimate inference in which the\nproperty inferred has as its extension the entire domain. Such\ninference are called \u2018keval\u0101nvayin\u2019 or\n\u2018universally positive\u2019 (cf. TS 55). The stock Ny\u0101ya\nexample is the inference \u201cThis is nameable, because it is\nknowable\u201d, nameability being regarded as a property of\neverything. Another example would be \u201cThis exists because it is\nproduced\u201d. If such an inference is sound, then its reason\nproperty and inferred property must exemplify the pervasion relation.\nAccording to the above definition, to say that nameability pervades\nknowability is to say that any locus of the property\nabsence-of-nameability is not a locus of knowability. The problem is\nthat, since nameability is a universal property,\nabsence-of-nameability is an uninstantiated (aprasiddha)\nproperty, and the Ny\u0101ya claim that such properties are\nontologically suspect. To put it another way, the statement \u201cany\nlocus of the property absence-of-nameability is not a locus of\nknowability\u201d includes a non-referring expression,\n\u201clocus-of-absence-of-nameability\u201d or \u201cunnameable\nthing\u201d, and hence is not truth-evaluable. The problem does not\narise for all uninstantiated properties, for some, e.g. being a\nsky-lotus, or being a square circle, can be shown to be constructs\nmade out of simpler instantiated properties. Thus, the statement\n\u201cThe square circle is circular\u201d can be taken not as\ncontaining a non-referring expression, but as meaning \u201cThe\ncircle is square and circular\u201d. However, \u2018unnameable\n(thing)\u2019 is not decomposable into two distinct properties this\nway.\n\nNone of the interpretations of the \u2018no counter-example\u2019\ndefinition considered by Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba can solve the problem of\nuniversally positive inferences, and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba accordingly\nrejects them all. His own definition uses a trick to get round the\nproblem.\n",
