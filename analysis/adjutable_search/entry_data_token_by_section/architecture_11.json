    "main_text": "Formalism and Anti-formalism || Formalism\n5.1 Formalism\nIn its most general sense, formalism works in architecture as it\ndoes (or doesn\u2019t) in other artforms. Thus, architectural\nformalism suggests that the sum total of aesthetic properties of an\narchitectural object are or arise from formal properties, such that\nour aesthetic judgments are warranted based on experience and\nassessment of just those properties. As architectural objects are\ntypically non-representational and designed with manipulation and\nrelation of forms as a primary task, it is natural that their formal\nproperties be seen as playing a central role in our aesthetic\nappreciation of them. The question posed to the traditional\n(\u201chard\u201d) formalist is whether those properties are\nunique or at least dominant drivers of aesthetic properties\nand judgment, a question underlined by important roles of history,\nstyles, and other contexts in our grasp of the architectural\nenterprise and individual architectural objects. Our aesthetic\njudgment of I. M. Pei\u2019s Louvre Pyramids is surely to some degree\nin reaction to their \u201cpure\u201d form but\u2014for the aware\nspectator\u2014perhaps just as much in reaction to their relationship\nto historical context (the Giza pyramids as emblematic of pyramidal\nform in architecture, and of monumental architecture altogether) or\nsetting (in contrast to the ornate neo-Baroque Louvre buildings that\nsurround them, but in keeping with traditional French emphasis on\ngeometric form in design).\nVariants of architectural formalism take formal properties as the\nproperties of (or arising from) the material or physical properties of\nbuilt structures (as consonant with concretism), or as the properties\nof (or arising from) the total properties specified by a set of formal\nparameters we identify with the architectural object (as consonant\nwith abstractism). Further architectural strains are characterized by\nmoderation (per Zangwill 2001), suggesting that some\narchitectural objects are best understood by appealing to their formal\nproperties, others not; or by assimilation of canonically non-formal\nproperties to a formalist scheme (in the manner of Levinson\u2019s\n\u201cindicated structures\u201d; see S. Fisher 2000b); or by a\n\u201cmereological\u201d view wherein some parts of a given\narchitectural object may be best understood and judged by their formal\nproperties, others not. For the merelogico-formalist, it might count\nin favor of considering such parts as independent architectural\nobjects that we can judge those parts on a formal basis alone.\nFormalism appears in some traditional architectural theories as a\nnormative practical or critical guideline, namely, that our best\ndesign thinking takes as central an architectural object\u2019s\nshape, color, and other formal elements. Other, non-formal aspects of\nan architectural object are discounted as contributing to its\nsuccess. Mitrovic (2011, 2013) embraces a normative formalist approach\nto criticism, on the grounds that the deeply visual nature of much\ncognition militates against basing appreciation or evaluation of\narchitectural objects exclusively or primarily on features we\nunderstand through non-visual means (such as context or history\nprovide). \n",
