But\ncan it explain how a law maker can do \u2018normative magic\u2019\n(Enoch 2014, 296), making mere words into law? Mark Greenberg has\nargued that:\n\nTrying to understand legislation on the model of communication is\nmisguided because legislation and legislative systems have purposes\nthat have no parallel in the case of communication and that may be\nbetter served if a statute\u2019s contribution to the content of the\nlaw is not constituted by what is communicated by the legislature.\n(Greenberg 2011, 221; for arguments against Greenberg\u2019s claim,\nsee Marmor 2014, 15\u201322, and Asgeirsson 2020, Chapter 1)\n\n\nThat can indeed be the case if, for example, the purposes of the law\nare best served if a court is authorised to depart from what the\nlegislature decided. But it is also possible for the law\u2019s\npurposes to be served by treating a law maker\u2019s contribution to\nthe content of the law as being just what the law maker communicated.\nConsider for simplicity the making of a particular legal norm. With a\ngesture of a hand, a police officer at the scene of an accident can\nwave to a driver to indicate that she can go ahead, or can direct the\ndriver to stop. The law, by authorising the officer to direct traffic,\nmakes the officer\u2019s gesture count as the law\u2019s decision as\nto whether the driver has permission to proceed or a duty to stop.\n\nLanguage facilitates the making of far more articulate legal norms.\nWhen the appeal court in Garner v Burr sent the matter back\nto the magistrate with instructions to convict, suppose that the\nmagistrate wrote \u2018fine: five shillings\u2019 on the court\ndocket. If the justice was authorised to impose such a fine, and\nwriting those words on the docket was a lawful way of exercising that\nlegal power, then how should we understand the contribution to the law\nof the act of the magistrate? That contribution would, in English law,\nbe just what the magistrate indicated by using the words: that Mr Burr\nwas thereby fined five shillings. A court bailiff would be treated by\nEnglish law as being authorised to collect five shillings, and not\nmore. The law\u2019s good reasons for such a way of proceeding are\nvery evident: after Mr Burr\u2019s presumably fair hearings in the\nmagistrate\u2019s court and the appeal court, when a magistrate (in\nthe exercise of a jurisdiction on behalf of a court) wrote those words\non the docket, the best way to proceed is for the bailiff to treat the\njudgment of the court as a fait accompli. Suppose, instead, that the\nbailiff treated the magistrate\u2019s decision as one weighty\nconsideration among others in the overall calculation concerning how\nmuch property to seize from Mr Burr. The loss of finality would be a\nsetback for the rule of law. The resulting discretionary power of\nbailiffs would likewise be a setback for the rule of law. And the\nshift of decision making power from the magistrates (subject to the\nappeal court\u2019s oversight) to a bailiff would be a setback for\nregulatory justice because of the loss of just and expert decision\nmaking as to the rights and the liabilities of the parties to a\ndispute.\n\nIt is the capacity of the law to regulate its own allocation of power\nin a just and effective way that explains why it is appropriate for\nthe law to give a court legal power to impose a fine by its act (that\nis, by what the judge says in the exercise of the power).\n\nNow consider the making of general legal norms. In England there is a\nValue Added Tax of 20 per cent. That is the case because the U.K.\nParliament enacted (in language that you may well consider rather\nperemptory) that \u2018VAT shall be charged at the rate of 20 per\ncent\u2019 (Value Added Tax Act 1994 s 2(1), as amended by the\nFinance (No 2) Act 2010, s 3(1)), and English law treats Parliament as\nhaving law-making authority. We can imagine a system in which the\ncontribution of that legislative act to the law of England is\nqualified by a discretion on the part of tax collectors to collect\nmore or less than 20 per cent. We can imagine a system in which judges\nare given an equitable jurisdiction to reduce the tax where a company\nsupplying goods and services is at risk of insolvency. There are sound\nand pressing reasons, instead, for English law to treat the decision\nof the legislature as having determined the tax. The central reason,\nof course, is the allocation of the taxing power to the Parliament;\nsubsidiary but very important reasons concern the rule of law values\nto be secured if taxpayers and enforcement officials and judges are\nall bound by the decision of Parliament.\n\nMark Greenberg writes, in the entry on\n legal interpretation,\n\nIt is crucial not to conflate a provision\u2019s linguistic meaning\nwith its contribution to the content of the law.... If, in addressing\nthe preliminary question of what legal interpretation seeks, we simply\nconflate a statute\u2019s contribution with its linguistic meaning,\nthen, among other mistakes, we miss the need for a substantive\nargument for that claim. (Greenberg 2021)\n\n\nHere is the substantive argument: the purposes of a legal system very\ncommonly include the allocation of decision-making power, enabling a\nperson or an agency not merely to take an action that they know will\nbe treated as legally consequential, but to decide what the law is to\nbe on some point. The law can authorise them to take an action that\nthe law itself treats as its decision of a matter of right or duty or\nliability. When, for example, the U.K. Parliament enacts that\n\u2018VAT shall be charged at the rate of 20 per cent\u2019, the\ncontribution to the law is that VAT shall be charged at the rate of 20\nper cent.\n\nThat argument, you might say, should not be overgeneralised, for not\nall legislation is like the Value Added Tax. Just as it is possible to\nmake law by the use of language, it is also possible to fail to do so:\nwhen the would-be lawmaker has no authority, or when the law deprives\nthe act of lawmaking effect because of a defect in the substance or\nthe process of the action of the would-be lawmaker, or when the law\nconfers on another agency the power to override or to change the law\nmade by the lawmaker. And it is possible for the law made by a\nlegislature or by the framers of a constitution to be morphed out of\nall recognition by a pattern of judicial acts that change its effect,\neven if the courts and all the lawyers describe the courts\u2019 role\nall along as \u2018interpretation\u2019. Moreover, in some\ncircumstances and for some purposes there is something to Ronald\nDworkin\u2019s picture of a judge in the United States as \u2018a\npartner continuing to develop, in what he believes is the best way,\nthe statutory scheme Congress began\u2019 (Dworkin 1986b, 313). For\nlegislation can create a scheme of regulation that cries out for\nelaboration in the course of the judicial resolution of disputes over\nits operation. But that work of reasoned elaboration is only an\noccasional aspect of a role in which a judge may be bound by a\nlegislative decision, where the law allocates a power of lawful\ndecision to the legislature.\n\nWe should conclude that it is not merely possible for an agency or a\nperson to make law by the use of language; it is a central technique\nof legal ordering (and of the rule of law) for the law to confer\nauthority on persons and agencies to make particular legal norms and\ngeneral rules of law. The reasons of political morality for doing so\nare indeed a dignified ground for the content of the law, although the\ntechniques that enable the effective allocation of legal power also\nlend themselves to abuse. And the moral value of the allocation of\nlegal power and its potential for abuse both depend on human language:\nthe most prodigiously useful set of tools for the articulation of a\npolicy and for the conferral and for the exercise of power.\n\nWhen lawmakers use those tools to make law, is it the linguistic\nmeaning of their action that determines the content of the law?\nGreenberg says that \u2018Linguistic meaning is the information that\nis reliably and systematically conveyed by words, sentences, and other\nlinguistic entities.\u2019 (see the entry on\n legal interpretation,\n section 2.1). But linguistic entities do not convey information, or\nmake law. We need to remind ourselves of J.L.Austin\u2019s slogan,\nand we need to remind ourselves of the lesson of the semantic sting:\nwhen an agency or a person has authority to make law, and exercises\nits authority lawfully (as Parliament did in imposing the Value Added\nTax, or as a court does in ordering the payment of a fine), it would\nbe absurd to think that the contribution to the law of its action is\ndetermined by the dispositions of speakers of the language to use the\nwords of the law maker in one way or another. The content of the law\nmade by the lawmaker is what the lawmaker did in the exercise of its\nlawmaking authority. That is, what it communicated by using the\nlanguage it used, in the way that it did, in \u2018the total speech\nsituation\u2019.\n",
