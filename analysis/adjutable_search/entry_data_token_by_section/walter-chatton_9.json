These English indivisibilists\nwere opposed by people such as Adam Wodeham (d. 1358) and Thomas\nBradwardine (d. 1349), basing themselves in Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics and in Ibn Sina (d. 1037) as transmitted through\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Maq\u0101\u1e63id\nal-fil\u0101sifa, which circulated widely in Latin translation,\nsometimes under the title Intentiones philosophorum. While\nmodern people often associate the infinite with mathematics,\nAristotle, Chatton, and Harclay's interests in the infinite and in\narguments about indivisibles usually operated in a roughly physical\ncontext. Despite this focus, critics of indivisibilism drew freely on\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s (borrowed) arguments against\nindivisibles, which were rather mathematical and Euclidean in\ncharacter, and Chatton and Harclay were bound to respond, especially\nsince these mathematical objections were discussed by John Duns Scotus\n(d. 1308), a towering figure for both men.\n5.2 What is Indivisibilism? Infinite Divisibility and Continuity\n\nIt is fairly easy to give a cursory statement of what an\nindivisible is supposed to be in this period, and to motivate, in a\ngeneral way, what lies behind disagreements concerning them. The root\nproblem involves a collision between the discrete and the continuous.\nThere are some things we want to see as absolutely smooth, gapless,\nand whole, call them continua; however, certain modes of\nthinking about continua force us to rely on discrete entities\nto measure or analyze them. A modern example might be the\ngeometric line and any set of numbers we lay against it; it is not\neasy to relate a set of discrete objects such as the real numbers to\nthe absolutely smooth line of geometry in a way that is practically\nand conceptually satisfying. The medieval debate reflects a similar\ncollision of intuitions. To take the physical side of the issue\nfirst, motion seems absolutely smooth, time seems absolutely smooth,\nspace seems likewise smooth (Aristotle declared this to be so in the\nPhysics, and moreover claimed that as it is with any one of\nthese three, motion/time/space, so too with the others). Again, the\nintensification of qualities seems smooth. So we have a handful of\nvery important quantities that come in various magnitudes as well as\nprocesses and alterations that are prima facie\ncontinuous. Mathematical examples of continua from the Euclidian side\ninclude geometrical objects like lines and planes and solids.\n\nHowever, measurement and analysis of these continua, physical or\nmathematical, make us want to posit discrete things, for example,\nlocations for motion and for space, discrete instants to analyze time,\npoints help us analyze lines, lines planes, and so on. If on the one\nhand such analyses are veridical, then the discrete entities\nmight be thought to be \u2018in\u2019 the continua somehow, but how\nexactly? Compositionally? Only analytically, in the mind? If\ncompositionally, then physically, or in some other way? What way? If\non the other hand these discrete things do not lie in or compose or\notherwise intimately relate to their continua, then how do they\nmeasure them? What else could they measure?\n\nThe stakes are not merely philosophical. Ancient mathematicians had\nsometimes conceived of a circle as a regular polygon with infinitely\nmany short side lengths, and Archimedes, no indivisibilist,\nnevertheless declared that surfaces were composed of all the lines in\nthem. If we think these discrete entities have an intimate connection\nto their continua, we may be drawn toward indivisibilism; but then we\nmust try to say how something absolutely smooth and infinitely\ndivisible can be related to the self-contained, distinct, indivisible,\nand discrete objects that constitute it or are at least in it somehow.\nIf on the other hand we are more impressed with the infinite\ndivisibility of the continuum we may have to reject composition by\nindivisibles, since while a geometrical line can be divided into other\nlines, points cannot be so divided.\n5.3 Why Argue for Indivisibilism as a Theologian?\n\nThe theological consequences of problems raised by continua are more\nfar-reaching and more practical than might be imagined. For example,\nan angel is indivisible, in some way analogous to a geometric point,\nbut we need to say angels move, and motion is continuous, like a\ngeometric line. Can a discrete point \u201cmove\u201d and by doing\nso trace out a continuous line? Aristotle argued strenuously that\nnothing indivisible can possibly move absolutely smoothly. But\ntheology requires us to assert that an angel exists in discrete place,\nthen subsequently and successively in another discrete place, even\nthough we cannot say that some of its \u201cparts\u201d were always\nheading to the new place because as an indivisible it has no parts.\nBut then any angelic motion we might be imagining is not absolutely\nsmooth, but rather jumpy. If angels are indivisible then angelic\nmotion must be \u201cgappy\u201d, and Aristotle teaches us that this\nis not motion at all.\n\nChatton wrote about indivisibles and continua chiefly in the context\nof angelic motion, although he sometimes touched on related issues of\nminima naturalia, condensation and rarefaction, and questions\nof whether a will can sin in an instant. Other indivisibilists in his\ntime used indivisibles to treat problems of celestial motion. All\nthese governing contexts are fundamentally physical. Chatton would\ndiscuss mathematical issues as required, especially in the face of\ncritique, but he advocated for belief in indivisibles in physical\ncontexts for theological reasons; since he thought that theology\nneeded recourse to real physics involving indivisibles, for him the\nconcept had to be defended and rehabilitated if possible. Opposing him\nin this were not only many of his contemporaries, but also the\nauthority of Aristotle.\n5.4 Chatton\u2019s (Rather Odd-Sounding) Opinions on the Continuum\n\nWhen Chatton was forced by critics to wander into mathematical issues\nhe did not always handle things skillfully. This fact, together with\nthe authority of Aristotle\u2019s anti-indivisibilism and the\nexplosion of technical and theoretical power dealing with the infinite\nin modern mathematics have led modern critics to see Chatton\u2019s\nindivisibilism as hopelessly na\u00efve. Moreover, his\nReportatio discussion on indivisibles sometimes displays\nconfusing exposition and abrupt changes of mind, perhaps under\npressure from contemporary critiques. If one reads only these texts\nand thinks of continua in modern terms, the negative assessment of him\nseems confirmed.\n\nMoreover, his views sound odd when baldly stated. Chatton claims, in\nrelation to the question whether angelic motion is continuous or\ndiscrete, that we must investigate the prior question \u201cIs a\nquantum composed from indivisibles, either permanent\nindivisibles or successive indivisibles?\u201d And his response is\nthat, yes, quanta are composed of indivisibles, but in\npotentia, where in potentia seems to imply\nan unusual part/whole relationship: these indivisibles are\nnot naturally separable from the wholes they compose, moreover they do\nnot exist separately and then aggregate to compose these wholes by\njoining with other indivisibles in making them be one thing per\nse. Indivisibles are in continua, they can be said to make up\nthat which they are a part of, but not by aggregation or\nconglomeration. Moreover, while God can complete the division of any\nfinite continua, such continua themselves are only finitely\ndivisible! It is this finitist claim that seems most baffling.\n\nOverall, we have an odd-sounding view, and it is hard to see why\nsomeone would hold it. The best way to understand Chatton\u2019s\nindivisibilism fairly is to turn from his Reportatio toward a\ndifferent text and to view his opinions as a direct response to\nAristotle\u2019s anti-indivisibilist arguments. Therefore some of\nthese arguments must be briefly exposited.\n5.5 How Aristotle Attacked Indivisibles\n\nAristotle\u2019s most famous arguments against the composition of\ncontinua out of indivisibles are in Physics, VI.1. His\ndiscussion is a bit disjointed. It can be difficult to untangle and\narrange the pieces for interpretation, or even to know how and when to\ndistinguish different arguments in the text. Chatton focuses on two\narguments in Chapter 1, the most famous of which is known as the\ntouching argument (Physics, VII.1, 231a21\u2013231b10)\nI present the reasoning of this argument as I think Chatton understood\nit below.\n\nThe main conclusion of the touching argument is this:\n\n\nThere can be no discrete indivisible entities composing a continuous\nextended magnitude.\n\n\nThe argument is by cases, and it tries to show that these three\nconcept-clusters\ndiscrete/indivisible\n/ composing a continuous extended magnitude\n\nare completely incompatible.\n\nUpon assuming for reductio that discrete indivisibles could\ncompose an extended continuum, there are four scenarios Aristotle\nthinks we must consider. To generate them, pick any two such alleged\nindivisibles composing a continuum. Then these indivisibles either (1)\ntouch a third indivisible or (2) do not touch a third indivisible.\nSuppose they do touch a third indivisible. Two subcases appear: they\ntouch it either (1a) both in the same spot, or (1b) each in different\nspots. On the other hand, if they do not touch a third indivisible it\nis for one of two reasons: either (2a) they have gaps in between them,\nor (2b) their extremities are one.\n\nThe touching argument is supposed to show that the assumptions of each\nsubcase pull apart the above concepts at some junction or other. In\narguing through each of the subcases we will boldface\nthe concepts which are being pulled apart or dislodged, and\nunderline the lever being used to do it. The destabilization\nalways comes at the expense of one of the concepts, as we will\ncarefully note.\n\nFor case (1), the lever that pries the concept cluster apart is the\nconcept of touching. Take supposed discrete indivisibles\nA and B, then consider discrete indivisible\nC. (It is easiest if we start by trying to imagine C\nin between them.) That they are all able to touch is presupposed by\nthe fact that they are all discrete. Since it is possible, let us\nassume it is actually the case that A and B touch\nC, and consider the two subcases.\n\n(1a) If they touch C in the same spot, then since C\nis indivisible, A and B must coincide, and hence\ncannot compose an extended magnitude, presumably because if two\ndiscrete indivisibles add nothing to the extension of the\nmagnitude then no amount of them can produce any extension at\nall. In this subcase the fact that they are discrete ensures the\npossibility of touching, but the\nindivisibility of C and its being touched\nin the same spot undermine the claim that they compose a\ncontinuous extended magnitude. The conflict is with the\nextended bit. Allowing \u201c\u21d4\u201d to symbolize\nindivisibles touching and \u201c=\u201d indivisibles coinciding, we\ncould picture the problem like this:\n\nA=B\u21d4C; therefore, A and\nB do not compose an extended magnitude\n\n(1b) If they touch C in different spots, then A and\nB can remain discrete, but we must conclude C has\nmore than one spot on it, hence is not indivisible. Here discrete\nensures the possibility of touching, but touching in\ndifferent spots makes discrete and\nindivisible come apart. We can picture the situation\nlike this:\n\nA\u21d4C\u21d4B; therefore, C is\nnot indivisible\n\n\nBy the law of excluded middle and dilemma, discrete\neither makes indivisible and composing a\ncontinuous extended magnitude inconsistent, or else makes\nitself inconsistent with\nindivisible, assuming that indivisibles touch.\nThe concept cluster is thus completely inconsistent under the\nassumption of touching.\n\nWhat happens when we assume they do not touch? There are two\npossibilities and so two non-touching cases to reason through: (2a)\nthey do not touch because they are separated, or (2b) they do\nnot touch because they have their extrema in\ncommon. Under either assumption we can again undermine at least\none element of the concept cluster.\n\nIf (2a) holds, then since they are separated, they can no\nlonger be seen as composing a continuous extended\nmagnitude. We can picture it like this:\n\nA   C   B; therefore,\nthey are not continuous\n\n\nThe problem now is obviously with the continuous bit\nof that complex concept; the magnitude they would compose is now\n\u2018gappy\u2019.\n\nIf (2b) holds then since A, B, and C have\ntheir extrema in common, they are really one, in which\ncase A, B, and C are no longer\ndiscrete. The situation can be pictured like this (we\ncan no longer really use distinct symbols to illustrate):\n\nABC; therefore, they are not discrete\n\n\nAristotle assumes from previous discussion that there are exactly\nthree ways things can be in a spatial or temporal order, as he puts\nit, can be in succession: two successive items either have\ntheir extremities as one (continuous; e.g., two halves of a\nline) or have their extremities together (contiguous; e.g., a\nbronze sphere immersed in water) or have their extremities such that\nnothing of the same kind intervenes between (merely in\nsuccession; e.g., two houses). Case (1) above shows what would\nhappen if two discrete indivisibles\u2019 extremities were not one but\nstill touched, that is, if they were contiguous but not continuous;\ncase (2a) shows what would happen if they were merely in succession,\nand case (2b) shows what would happen if their boundaries were one,\nthat is, if they were continuous. Hence Aristotle seems to feel he has\ncaptured all relevant cases here.\n\nLet us summarize the incompatibilities. Assuming there could be\ndiscrete indivisibles composing a continuous extended magnitude:\n\n\n(1a) their touching as a whole makes extended\nuntenable;\n\n(1b) their touching by parts makes indivisible\nuntenable;\n\n(2a) their being separated makes continuous\nuntenable;\n\n(2b) their having extremities as one makes\ndiscrete untenable.\n\n\nHence, we may conclude it is impossible that discrete indivisibles\ncompose an extended continuum.\n\nNotice every concept in the cluster gets its due, except the concept\ncomposing, which is never contradicted, but rather\nframes the whole argument; together with his discussion of \u201cin\nsuccession\u201d it gives us the four cases and helps insure they are\nexhaustive. We can detect a nice symmetry in the touching argument\nthus analyzed:\n\n\n(1) Discrete indivisibles that touch have a problem composing extended\ncontinua. There are two ways to view their touching, compositionally\nspeaking: (a) the first undermines the extension of the continuum they\nallegedly compose, (b) the second undermines their own\nindivisibility.\n\n(2) Discrete indivisibles that do not touch also have a problem\ncomposing extended continua. There are two ways to view their\nnon-touching, compositionally speaking: (a) the first undermines the\ncontinuity of the continuum they allegedly compose, (b) the second\nundermines their own discreteness.\n\n\nMoreover, in the same chapter of the Physics Aristotle gives\nanother anti-indivisibilist argument that supplements or works with or\nperhaps overlaps the touching argument (it is not easy to say exactly\nwhat he intended). Chatton tends to treat it as if it is somewhat\nseparable, or at least as if it requires additional response. We might\nview it as an attempt to address the concept of\ncomposing. This second argument connects\ncomposition and infinite divisibility in continua, but in an\nanti-indivisibilist vein, and can be reconstructed as follows:\n\n\nEverything composed of certain realities is divisible into those\nrealities as parts, and everything divisible into parts must have\nthose parts touching each other while they are in it. Now continua are\ncomposed either of divisible realities or indivisible realities. If\ninto divisible realities, then these parts touch by sharing a\nboundary, and there is no problem; they form a continuum and are\nthemselves divisible, in fact infinitely divisible. If into\nindivisible realities, then these realities must touch, and we have\nall the problems the touching argument brought out under cases (1a)\nand (1b). Therefore, continua are composed exclusively of divisibles,\nare divisible exclusively into divisibles, and are infinitely\ndivisible. (see Physics, VII.1, 231b10\u201317)\n\n\nWe can distill all of this into a single statement resembling a\nslogan:\n\n\nDiscrete indivisibles have a problem composing extended continua:\ninsofar as they are indivisible, they cannot compose anything\nextended; insofar as they are discrete, they cannot compose anything\ncontinuous.\n\n\nThe slogan makes it easy to understand why Aristotle\u2019s\nanti-indivisibilist arguments were felt by many in Chatton\u2019s\ntime to be decisive on the issue of indivisibles and the continuum.\nWhen stated in this way anti-indivisibilism sounds almost like common\nsense. But Chatton thought this was an illusion.\n5.6 Chatton\u2019s Response to Aristotle in Four Conclusions\n\nChatton thought the touching argument could be defanged in one move.\nLooking carefully at Aristotle\u2019s arguments Chatton notices that\nthe discreteness of the indivisibles and a kind of temporal notion of\ncomposition are really doing most of the work. Aristotle is imagining\nwhat would happen if small, discrete, separated, independently\nexisting things would come together and make a continuum; he is\nthinking of Democritus in particular, and of his atoms, existing\nin actu apart from anything they might compose. But this view\nhas very little relevance to what Chatton was trying to do with\nindivisibles in theology. Although the motion of an indivisible may be\nproblematic and needs to be clarified, the first step to getting\nindivisibles positively involved in the physics of angelic and\ncelestial motion is simply to reverse their banishment by Aristotle.\nChatton did not oppose the touching argument merely because he was\nforced to when his critics raised it against him; rather\nChatton\u2019s treatment of indivisibles denies the relevance of the\ntouching argument because he thinks the perceived universality of its\nconclusion is merely illusory.\n\nIn Quaestio de compositione continui, a text which dates from\nthe 1320\u2019s and which contains a better organized and clearer\ndiscussion than his Reportatio of the same time period,\nChatton (or possibly one of his followers) offers four conclusions,\neach of which sounds a bit strange in isolation, but which make sense\nin the context of the touching argument. First we quote him, then give\nsome analysis that may relieve some of the strangeness:\n\n\nConclusion #1: ...I hold three conclusions. First,\nthat no continuum is composed of indivisibles existing in\nactu, because there is a contradiction between the terms\n\u201ccontinuum\u201d and \u201can indivisible in\nactu\u201d. This is because if there is a continuum, its parts\nare so related that none exists on its own, actually [in\nactu] separated from the other parts; but if an indivisible did\nactually [in actu] exist, it would have to exist on its own,\nseparated from other parts of the same kind. Democritus says the\nopposite, positing the continuum to be composed from atoms, which form\na \u201ccontinuum\u201d merely through a kind of congregation.\nAristotle proceeds against him for this reason, but Aristotle\u2019s\narguments do not apply to someone who agrees that\n\u201ccontinuum\u201d and \u201cindivisible in actu\u201d\ncontradict, [as I do]. (Quaestio de compositione continui,\nparagraph 56)\n\n\nChatton\u2019s main concession here is that \u201cindivisible in\nactu entails discrete\u201d, and discrete does conflict with\ncontinuous, as Aristotle shows. This seems to mean that Chatton\nconcedes the whole of subcase (2a) in the touching argument but denies\nits relevance. Aristotle\u2019s case (2a) applies to Democritus, for\nexample, but not to those who believe instead in indivisibles in\npotentia:\n\n\nConclusion #2: The second conclusion is that the\ncontinuum is composed of indivisibles in potentia.\n(Quaestio de compositione continui, paragraph 57)\n\n\nHere Chatton claims, not surprisingly, that there is another kind of\nindivisible; these he calls \u201cindivisibles in\npotentia\u201d, which can compose a continuum. Given the\nconcession in the first conclusion, it must be the case that these\nindivisibles in potentia are not discrete.\n\nThis is the master key to understanding Chatton\u2019s critique of\nAristotle. For it is the discreteness of the contained indivisible\nthat Chatton denies, and which he views as doing all the work in the\ntouching argument, not only in case (2a), but even in cases (1a) and\n(1b). This fact about the touching argument is easy to miss, since it\nmay seem as if the conflict between discrete and continuous only\noccurs in case (2). But it is discreteness that insured the\npossibility of touching, and since both of subcases under case (1)\ndepend upon touching to get the inconsistencies, without the\nassumption of their discreteness (what Chatton calls their being\nin actu), none of the arguments in case (1) can even get\nstarted. Hence Chatton believes he has, with these two paragraphs,\ndispensed with cases (1a), (1b), and (2a) in the touching argument in\none go.\n\nBut really case (2b) is also taken care of, since in that subcase\nAristotle simply shows that indivisibles are not discrete, something\nChatton already conceded. Hence, he sidesteps the entire touching\nargument with these first two conclusions.\n\nTwo further conclusions that Chatton gives seemed strange to his\ncontemporaries and stranger still to us. They are aimed at the final\nargument sketched in 5.5 above, the one relating composition and\ninfinite divisibility in continua. That argument forces Chatton to\ntake a stand on how his indivisibles in potentia compose a\ncontinuum, and on infinite divisibility in such a way that he evades\nAristotle\u2019s reasoning in that argument. His next conclusion\nbegins the process:\n\n\nConclusion #3: The third conclusion is: while no\ncreature could, granting the way the world actually works, complete\nthe division of a continuum, or divide it into pieces without the part\nthey just divided having parts of its own, or see an indivisible\nentity on its own; nevertheless, God could do any of these things, and\nhe could confer upon a creature the power to do any of them as well.\nAnd why not, given that God can perfectly well make physical fire\naffect our souls [in hell], and can make it so that the human eye can\nsee a spiritual creature? (Quaestio de compositione continui,\nparagraph 58)\n\n\nChatton\u2019s third claim is that indivisibles in potentia\nare not naturally the bottom level of division of any\nextended magnitude. However, God can complete the division of a\ncontinuum into partless parts (indivisibles) and cause one of them, or\nindeed any indivisible, to be seen alone (he is thinking of angels\nhere). Such a thing would be an indivisible in actu. This\nsuggests that for him indivisibles in actu are, for example,\nwhat the bottom level would be if God supernaturally completed the\ndivision of an extended continuum; there is no contradiction involved\nwith such indivisibles \u201cbeing in\u201d an extended thing or\nwith them being the supernatural result of dividing it, there is only\na problem with them discretely composing it, which Chatton already\ndenied. The indivisible parts of true continua do not and cannot\nmetaphysically precede them in order to compose them. Chatton in\neffect denies the first premise of the argument, that\n\u201cEverything composed of certain realities is divisible\ninto those realities as parts\u201d; continua are composed of\nindivisibles in potentia, but divisible, and that only by\nGod, into indivisibles in actu. This leads to a surprising\ncorollary: God can break the geometric line into lowest constituents,\nbut he cannot restore it from those pieces, since this is a\ncontradiction.\n\nWhat recourse does the Aristotelian have at this point? Perhaps simply\nto point out that however it goes with divisibility and with the\ntouching of indivisibles, nevertheless continua are infinitely\ndivisible, and indivisibles aren\u2019t divisible, so they cannot be\nintegral parts of continua. This is practically to define\n\u201ccontinuous\u201d as \u201cinfinitely divisible\u201d, but\nnevertheless it is a powerful intuition, and Aristotle would certainly\nnot be the last to insist on it. Chatton\u2019s final conclusion is\naimed at this last gasp. He simply denies, on theological grounds,\nthat a finite continuum is infinitely divisible, and this helps\nexplain the motivation for what is otherwise his strangest claim:\n\n\nConclusion #4: I say, therefore, that in all existing\nthings there are only finitely many entities, whether of an\nindivisible or divisible kind. Nor could God make it be the case that\ninfinitely many things compose any continuum in the physical world,\nnor could He make it the case that, in any existing thing, there are\nparts composing it so numerous that there can\u2019t be more\n[absolutely]; but rather, [it is correct merely to say that]\nthe components will be so great a plurality that there cannot be more\nin the particular thing, because [absolutely speaking] God\ncan always make more of something beyond any given plurality.\n(Quaestio de compositione continui, paragraph 82)\n\n\nChatton\u2019s final conclusion breaks into four parts:\n\n(1) All existing things, because finite, have at most finitely many\nentities in them or composing them [naturally].\n\n(2) It is logically impossible for any existing thing [even a\ncontinuum] to have infinitely many entities in it or composing it,\nwhere \u201cinfinite\u201d means \u201cso many things that there\ncannot be more, absolutely speaking\u201d. Nothing can be an absolute\nplenum.\n\n(3) It is logically possible that a given thing cannot have any more\nentities in it as a particular individual thing. There is such a thing\nas relative fullness.\n\n(4) The reason for (2) and (3) is that God by his absolute power can\nmake more of a thing beyond any given number of that thing. Absolute\nfullness would restrict God\u2019s absolute power and so is\nimpossible, as (2) claims; while relative fullness is self-consistent\nand consistent with God\u2019s absolute power and so is possible, as\n(3) claims.\n\nThe upshot of these four clauses is that no finite thing is infinitely\ndivisible into parts; no physical thing because all such are finite,\nnor anything else if \u2018infinite\u2019 means so much there\ncannot be more in it, for a given object cannot always have more\nin it and remain the same object, and, speaking generally, even if\ncontinuum c were composed of infinitely many entities of type\ne, God can always make more e\u2019s.\nAristotle\u2019s argument connecting composition and infinite\ndivisibility uses an illegitimate view of infinity, given divine\npower.\n\nChatton had more to say about how indivisibles touch, and his ideas\nwere again original and useful enough that even Wodeham, his\nstaunchest critic, was willing to apply them in certain contexts,\nremarking that Chatton\u2019s arguments were a rational way to defend\nan unreasonable conclusion. But overall we should say that\nChatton\u2019s indivisibilism is not an organic theory of structure\nof continua meant to undergird mathematics or even physics, rather, it\nsimply shows a way to go against Aristotle in order to save the\ntheological situation.\n6. Future Contingents\n6.1 A Fatalist Argument\n\nWhat philosophers call the problem of future contingents goes\ntogether naturally with the related and more well-known problem of\nfree will and determinism. In the Middle Ages, as now, we really\nfind a cluster of several related problems radiating from a single\ncommon conundrum or paradox. One important difference is that the\nmediaeval problem has some theological branches that today receive\nless philosophical attention. For example, few modern philosophers\nseriously consider the seeming inconsistency between veridical\nprophecy and the contingency of the future, or whether angels of high\nrank can reveal future contingents to inferior angels, but these were\nimportant issues with their own test cases in the Middle Ages.\nMoreover, the problem was far more stark, severe, and difficult for\nmediaeval Christian thinkers than for modern secular philosophers,\nsince it was doctrinally unacceptable to solve the problem by ejecting\nsome element of the paradox \u2013 all elements of the\nparadox were important pieces of Christian doctrine. One felicitous\nconsequence of this struggle is that some very original and deep\nphilosophy was created and employed in an attempt to find a stable\nsolution. I will briefly present the conundrum at the heart of the\nmatter, and then examine Chatton\u2019s own radical and relatively\noriginal solution to the\n problem.[8]\n\nConsider the following grouping of ideas, objects, and events in our\nuniverse (Chatton\u2019s usual Latin terms for certain cognates are\ndistinguished in parentheses):\n\n\n\nRIGID\nOPEN \n\n1.\nnecessity\n8.\ncontingency (f. sg. contingentia, \u2013ae)\n\n\n2.\nuniversal causality\n9.\nhuman free will \n\n3.\nuniversal bivalence (=every proposition is determinately either\ntrue or false)\n10.\ncontingent things (n. pl.\ncontingentia,-um) \n\n4.\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge\n11.\nplanning and working for the future \n\n5.\nveridical prophecy\n12.\nfuture contingent propositions (propositiones contingentes\nde futuro) \n\n6.\npredestination\n13.\nthe undetermined future \n\n7.\nprovidence\n14.\nmerit for good acts, freely done  \n\n\nNo kind of strict paring between list entries across from each other\non the right and left is intended here. Rather, we should notice three\nthings. (1) All of the putative objects and phenomena on the left-hand\nunder the heading RIGID are elements of the universe that are firm and\nunchanging, and their existence seems to entail a kind of immutability\nof reality; the world cannot be otherwise. (2) Those putative objects\nunder OPEN, by contrast, seem indeterminate and loose, and their\nexistence demands recognition of alternatives; the world can be\notherwise. (3) It is common and quite attractive to believe in the\nexistence of many of the elements on the left and on the right\nsimultaneously, but it seems clear that the implications of that\nbelief are often contradictory, entailing that one and the same piece\nof reality both can be otherwise and cannot be otherwise in the same\nway at the same time. In short, certain mixtures of these elements,\nright and left, are nearly irresistible parts of our total outlook on\nthe universe, but unfortunately they seem to yield contradictions. Not\nevery pairing of items yields a paradox, e.g., 1 and 8 do not. There\ncan be both necessity and contingency in the world. The reader is\ninvited to consider, however, just how many left-right pairings from\nthese lists do seem both attractive and impossible.\n\nThere are as many possible solutions to these paradoxes as may be\nimagined, but there are really only three ways out; either: (1) accept\nthe rigid element of reality at the expense of the open element, or\n(2) accept the open element at the expense of the rigid element, or\n(3) show that the contradiction between the two is only a seeming\ncontradiction. Most mediaeval philosophers took this third approach in\ntheir solutions.\n\nBy the time Chatton was writing, it was quite common to present a\nbasic fatalist or necessitarian argument to show that God\u2019s\nforeknowledge, which seems deeply connected to his providence, is not\nconsistent with future contingent things and events. Here is\nChatton\u2019s version of this standard fatalist argument:\n\nHerein lies the difficulty of this question \u2013 if it were\nconsistent with the contingency of future events that God knows future\ncontingents, then this consequence would follow: \u2018God knew that\nthe Antichrist will come; therefore the Antichrist will come\u2019.\nThe antecedent of this consequence is necessary, as is the consequence\nitself, hence the consequent is necessary. But the [necessary]\nconsequent \u2018the Antichrist will come\u2019 is not consistent\nwith the contingency [of the future event the Antichrist\ncomes]. Therefore [God\u2019s knowledge is not consistent with\nthe contingency of the future]. (Reportatio I, 10\u201348,\nd. 38, paragraph 2, p. 347)\n\n\nTwo things to note. (1) The coming of the Antichrist is a\nstandard example of a future event that is anticipated but which seems\ncontingent; however, there is no special importance attached to the\ncontent of the example; equally popular was the less dramatic example\n\u2018Socrates will sit\u2019. (2) A consequence is what we\ncall a consecution today (something of the form \u2018\\(p\\)\ntherefore \\(q\\)\u2019), but in this case we can, without distortion,\nmodel the reasoning by treating it as a conditional. The fatalist\nargues that (IF God knew the Antichrist will come THEN the Antichrist\nwill come) is necessary, and moreover, the antecedent, \u2018God\nknows the Antichrist will come\u2019, is also necessary, since\nGod\u2019s knowledge is certain and firm. But if (IF \\(p\\) THEN\n\\(q)\\) is necessary, and furthermore the antecedent \\(p\\) is\nnecessary, it follows by uncontroversial logical principles that the\nconsequent \\(q\\) is necessary; hence we can conclude that the coming\nof the Antichrist is necessary, which violates our assumption that the\nfuture is open. Chatton summarizes the fatalist argument this way:\n\nThis whole thing can also be made more compact with the formula:\n\u2018God knew that \\(a\\) will be; therefore \\(a\\) will necessarily\nbe\u2019. (Reportatio I, 10\u201348, d. 38, paragraph 2, p.\n347)\n\n\nThis is the argument to be defeated. After brief consideration of some\nother views, including Peter Auriol\u2019s, which seems to have\ninfluenced him in certain respects, Chatton draws together the threads\nof his discussion into a solution that is quite original and radical,\nbut which he supports only hesitantly, not apparently out of\nintellectual reservations but out of fear of falling into heresy.\nAlthough his hesitation makes it difficult to pin him down, a\nreasonably secure reconstruction of his ideas seems possible. His\nsolution has two parts: (1) He offers a counter-argument to the\nfatalist\u2019s reasoning, and (2) he clarifies the way God\nknows future contingents.\n6.2 Chatton\u2019s Anti-Fatalist Argument\n\nI present the first part of his solution as an annotated argument.\nFirst, we should state the fatalist argument generally. For any\ncontingent object \\(a\\) we have:\n\nNecessarily (IF God knows that \\(a\\) will be THEN \\(a\\) will\nbe).\nNecessarily God knows that \\(a\\) will be.\nNecessarily \\(a\\) will be.\n\n\nOr, in modern notation:\n\n\\(\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)\\)\n\\(\\Box p\\)\n\\(\\Box q\\)\n\n\nThis argument is clearly valid by application of the K-axiom and modus\nponens, i.e., by the K-axiom we can go from the necessity of the\nconsequence, \\(\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)\\), to the necessity of both parts,\n\\(\\Box p\\rightarrow \\Box q\\), and then we just apply modus ponens at\nline\n (2).[9]\n\nChatton rebuts this argument by denying the second premise. He claims\nthat when \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 names a contingent thing, the sentence\n\u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019 is contingent, not\nnecessary. His counter-argument is based on two pieces of\nphilosophical analysis (premises 1 and 4 below), and a theory of\nequivalence (premise 7):\n\nTo assert a sentence of the form \u2018\\(a\\) will be\u2019\nreally means either to assert: (i) that \u2018\\(a\\) will be\u2019 is\ntrue, or (ii) that \u2018\\(a\\) is\u2019 will be true. These two\nexpositions are non-equivalent, since one can be true while the other\nis false. [Explicit premise. Chatton claims to borrow this analysis\nfrom an opinion that was making the rounds at Oxford when he studied\nthere.]\nIf \\(a\\) names a contingent thing, then option (i) is right out,\nsince this would entail that there is no reason to take trouble about\nthe future. [Explicit premise. Chatton draws the fatalistic inference\nfrom option (i) and thereby rejects that option.]\nTherefore, option (ii) holds: if \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 names a\ncontingent thing in \u2018\\(a\\) will be\u2019, we must understand\nthe sentence \u2018\\(a\\) will be\u2019 to be equivalent to the\nfollowing contingent sentence \u2018\u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d\nwill be true\u2019. [From 1 and 2. \u2018\u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d will\nbe true\u2019 must be contingent, because otherwise it is no\ndifferent in meaning or fatalistic consequences from option (i).]\nFrom now on let \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 name a contingent thing. Now,\nthe sentence \u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019, properly\nexposited, is equivalent to this conjunction: \u2018God knows \\(a\\)\nAND \\(a\\) will be\u2019. [Explicit premise. This analysis is\nChatton\u2019s original contribution.]\nTherefore the following expository equivalences hold: \u2018God\nknows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019 = \u2018God knows \\(a\\) AND \\(a\\)\nwill be\u2019 = \u2018God knows \\(a\\) AND \u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d\nwill be true\u2019. [From 3 and 4.]\n\u2018God knows \\(a\\) AND \u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d will be\ntrue\u2019 has a contingent conjunct, namely the second conjunct.\n[From 3.]\nWhen a proposition is exposited by a conjunction, if one of the\nconjuncts of the exposition is contingent, the original proposition is\nas well. [Implicit premise.]\n\u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019 is contingent. [From 5,\n6, and 7.]\n\n\nTo sum up, the first part of Chatton\u2019s response comes to\nthis:\n\n\u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019 is equivalent to the\nconjunction \u2018God knows \\(a\\) AND \u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d will be\ntrue\u2019.\nThe sentence \u2018God knows \\(a\\)\u2019 is of course necessary,\nbut \u2018\u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d will be true\u2019 is contingent,\ntherefore the conjunction of the two sentences is contingent.\nTherefore, since \u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019 is\nequivalent to a contingent sentence, it is itself contingent.\n\n\nTwo remarks need to be made. First, premise 4 seems to have originated\nwith Chatton, and he was followed in this by the next generation of\nOxford theologians, for example, Robert\n Holcot.[10]\n Second, even if we accept this argument, Chatton still owes us an\nexplanation of what the first conjunct means in the\nconjunction \u2018God knows \\(a\\) AND \u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d will be\ntrue\u2019. On the assumption that \\(a\\) is a contingent future\nthing, we can still sensibly ask, how can God possibly know\nthis future contingent \\(a\\)? Chatton admits that this conjunct is\nnecessary, but this fact, together with the firmness of divine\nknowledge, seems to violate our sense of \\(a\\)\u2019s contingency; it\nseems we can just raise the problem of future contingents all over\nagain, focusing on the left-hand conjunct. There is yet another\nproblem. Does the fact that God knows contingent \\(a\\) entail that his\nknowledge changes when \\(a\\) comes into existence in time?\nFortunately, Chatton is aware of these difficulties and tries to solve\nthem by distinguishing God\u2019s knowing a thing from his\ncognizing it.\n6.3 God\u2019s knowing versus God\u2019s cognizing\n\nChatton claims it can still be true that God knows \\(a\\) when \\(a\\) is\na future contingent object, provided we understand God\u2019s grasp\nof \\(a\\) as divine cognition:\n\n\u2026 [T]he larger proposition \u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will\nbe\u2019 is equivalent to this copulative sentence \u2013 \u2018God\nknows \\(a\\) and \\(a\\) will be\u2019. This I will concede, as long as\nthe \u2018knowing\u2019 referred to in the definiendum is taken to\nbe a cognition. (Reportatio I, 10\u201348, d. 38,\nparagraph 28, p. 352.)\n\n\nChatton explains his idea of divine cognition by recourse to an\nanalogy, a distinction, and a claim about all operations of the divine\nintellect.\n\nChatton\u2019s analogy is this: cognition is to knowledge as\napprehension is to assent or assertion. Just as apprehension\nimplies the mere grasp of something without additional judgment about\nit, so too cognition implies the mere grasp of something, without the\nadditional affirmative judgment implied in the term\n\u2018knowledge\u2019. Hence, when Chatton uses the phrase\n\u2018God knows \\(a\\)\u2019 in the above solution, it should be\nunderstood as \u2018God cognizes \\(a\\)\u2019, meaning that we are\nonly talking about God\u2019s grasp of \\(a\\), not about any\nkind of approval, disapproval, agreement, disagreement, etc.\n(Reportatio I, 10\u201348, d. 39, paragraph 14, p. 363). In\ncognizing, the divine intellect is somehow holding \\(a\\) without\nconfirming it, judging it, or creating it. Only one part of the divine\nintellect is in play, not divine assent or the divine will.\n\nAnother difference between knowledge and cognition is that\nknowledge is necessarily of a present existent, whereas cognition\ndoes not have this restriction (Reportatio I,\n10\u201348, d. 38, paragraph 42, p. 355). The upshot of the\ndistinction in this context is that God cannot know future\nobjects, for example, since they are not yet; however, he can\ncognize them.\n\nFinally (and this claim he intends to apply to both divine cognition\nand divine knowledge), God\u2019s knowledge and cognition are\nneither mediated by propositions nor are they generally of\npropositions (Reportatio I, 10\u201348, d. 39,\nparagraph 14, p. 363; Quodlibet, q. 1, paragraph 36). Chatton\nholds that God\u2019s intellectual activity is not discursive or\nrepresentative in any way, and that the usual objects of divine\nintellectual activity are not propositions, but rather real things,\nthat is, res. God does not require any mediator in the\noperation of his intellect with respect to creation; for example, he\nrequires no concepts or propositions in order to know or to cognize.\nRather, God directly cognizes (for example) the future contingent\nthings (res) that he cognizes, whether those things are\npeople, the shoes on their feet, or even occasionally and somewhat\ntrivially, the spoken, written, or mental propositions they talk,\nwrite, or think with. God sees them all through a kind of direct\nvision or intuition. As noted above, Chatton was a realist about\nrelations, and since relations are accidents inhering in their\nsubjects, for God to cognize a future res is also for him to\ncognize the relational accidents of that res. So, in\ncognizing a res, God cognizes everything about it, and so\ndirectly cognizes all the situations or states of affairs of this\nres as well, Thus, his grasp of it is complete. Because it\nhas no intermediary, God\u2019s cognition is not something separate\nfrom him; there is no determinate representation of a thing by\nwhich he cognizes. Consequently, divine cognition is, in a sense,\nnot really distinct from God himself.\n\nWith the idea of divine cognition thus developed, we can now return to\nthe problems we raised at the end of the last section. First, we\nasked: How can \u2018God knows \\(a\\)\u2019 be necessary when \\(a\\)\nis both future and contingent? After all, it seems the firmness of\nGod\u2019s knowledge of \\(a\\) and the determinacy of his concepts of\n\\(a\\) are a sign that \\(a\\) cannot be otherwise. But now we have our\nanswer. By \u2018God knows \\(a\\)\u2019 Chatton means only \u2018God\ncognizes \\(a\\)\u2019, and divine cognition is (1) non-judgmental and\nnon-voluntaristic, (2) not necessarily of determinate existents, and\n(3) a complete, though non-discursive, direct awareness. Consequently,\nwhen God cognizes some future \\(a\\), that cognition is in no way\njudgmental, confirming or otherwise approving of \\(a\\), nor does it\nentail the existence of \\(a\\), although it does grasp all that matters\nabout \\(a\\). In short, divine cognition is an omniscience that does\nnot interfere in any way with the natural operation or condition of\n\\(a\\), nor does it force \\(a\\) to exist, or imply it already does. The\ndivine will is out of the picture; mere cognition of \\(a\\) is not\ncausative of \\(a\\). Neither do we have to worry about the rigidity of\nsome structure called \u2018God\u2019s knowledge\u2019 and its\nrelation to \\(a\\). All divine intellection is direct, and so God does\nnot have a body of propositions about \\(a\\) or any intermediary\nconcepts of \\(a\\) by which he cognizes it.\n\nIn short, Chatton\u2019s view is that the necessity we detect in\n\u2018God knows \\(a\\)\u2019 attaches to God as a necessary\ncognizer, i.e., it attaches to the divine intellect alone, not to the\nobjects it cognizes or to some distinct, determinate body of truths\ncalled \u2018God\u2019s knowledge\u2019. It is almost as if, for\nChatton, \u2018God cognizes [future contingent] \\(a\\)\u2019 simply\nmeans, \u2018the all-seeing God exists and contingent \\(a\\) will\nexist\u2019.\n\nFrom these considerations we also get Chatton\u2019s answer to the\nsecond difficulty: Does God\u2019s knowledge of the world change when\nthe world changes? Chatton can formulate his answer with the same\nnotion of cognition. There is no change implied in God when contingent\n\\(a\\) comes into existence: (1) God\u2019s cognition has not changed,\ncertainly, since cognition is indifferent to existence, but (2)\nGod\u2019s knowledge has not changed either, at least not in any\nserious sense. For there are only three ways that God\u2019s\nknowledge could be said to change: (2a) it could be that the mental\nproposition \u2018Socrates is sitting\u2019 in God\u2019s intellect\ngoes from being false to true, say, when standing Socrates sits, i.e.,\nit literally changes truth value in God\u2019s mind; or (2b) it could\nbe that Socrates is now sitting and before he was not, and so before\nGod\u2019s knowledge contained the proposition \u2018Socrates is not\nsitting\u2019 but now it contains the proposition \u2018Socrates is\nsitting\u2019 instead; or similarly, (2c) it could be that Socrates\nis now sitting and before he was not, and so before God knew the\nnon-seated Socrates which was signified by \u2018Socrates is not\nsitting\u2019 but now he knows the seated Socrates signified by\n\u2018Socrates is sitting\u2019.\n\n(2a) and (2b) are not a problem because God\u2019s knowledge is not\ngenerally of propositions, nor is it mediated by them. And even when\nit is of propositions, there is nothing special about how he knows a\nproposition\u2019s shift from truth to falsity, as distinguished from\nany other form of change. (2c) is not a problem, because Chatton\nfamously held that the thing signified by \u2018Socrates is\nsitting\u2019, is exactly the same as the thing signified by\n\u2018Socrates is not\n sitting\u2019.[11]\n God cognizes of every proposition when it will be true; he cognizes\nthe \u201ctruth career\u201d of each proposition. But he cognizes\nthis at once, as of now. And when a proposition he cognizes becomes\ntrue, he knows it. But again, this is no change in God, who does not\nthink discursively, but rather sees every created thing, including\npropositions, as res.\n\nThere are still many questions we would like answered here, of course.\nFor example, what is the ontological status of the not-yet existing\nthings that God cognizes? Exactly what does God cognize when he\ncognizes a present non-existent? These issues require a more extensive\ntreatment than can be given here.\n7. The Intellectio Theory of Concepts\n\nIn the last half of the twentieth century the most documented and\ndiscussed aspect of Chatton\u2019s thought concerned his views on\nhuman cognition and the metaphysics of concepts. He was not especially\ninnovative on these topics, but he had considerable influence on\ncontemporary debates, having brought about a dramatic change of heart\nin Ockham concerning the nature of general concepts.\n\nOckham famously rejected the existence of anything metaphysically\nuniversal outside the human mind; he was an uncompromising nominalist\nin the mediaeval debate on universals. His rejection followed, not\nfrom his razor, but from his conviction, supported through long\nargumentation, that the very idea of a \u2018universal substance\nexisting outside the mind\u2019 was simply incoherent, contradictory,\nor false. No adequate theory of this idea had been or could ever be\ngiven; everything outside the mind is irreducibly individual, not on\naccount of some distinct individuating force, as Scotus had said, but\nsimply in se ipso. On his view, the only things in reality\nthat could in any way be truly denominated \u2018universal\u2019 are\nthe general concepts existing in the human mind, for example the\nconcept man or the concept white. The general\nconcept white is universal, but only in the following\nreduced, metaphysically innocuous sense: white applies to\nmany individual things.\n\nThis line of thought led Ockham quite naturally to offer an account of\nthe metaphysical status of general concepts. To what Aristotelian\ncategory do they belong? Are concepts in the human mind\nsubstances, that is, \u2018things\u2019 in their own right,\nand so are in their own way as real and independent as people and\nhorses? Or are they instead accidents, that is, not\nstand-alone entities, but rather modifications of stand-alone\nentities, the way for Aristotle tall is not a stand-alone\nsubject, but simply a way that a stand-alone subject can be?\nOckham began his career defending the first option, but ended it\ndefending the latter. The cause of this transformation was the\nsustained attacks of Walter Chatton.\n\nOckham\u2019s early theory of concepts, often dubbed \u2018the\nfictum theory\u2019, was probably influenced in some measure\nby the work or at least the terminology of Peter Auriol. According to\nOckham\u2019s first account, a concept is an Aristotelian substance,\nbut not a normal material substance, such as a human being, nor a\nnonmaterial substance, such as an angel \u2013 such beings can be the\nsubjects of accidents and so could be said to have esse\nsubjectivum (=subjective being) \u2013 rather, concepts are in\nan entirely different class of substances, which have the sort of\nexistence in the mind that an object fashioned by thought has, to wit,\nesse objectivum (the being of a thought-object), or, as he\nsometimes says, a concept is a fictum (=a mentally-fashioned\nbeing).\n\nChatton criticized this theory relentlessly, primarily on the ground\nthat concepts as ficta are an unnecessary intermediary\nbetween the cognizer and the thing cognized, such that the cognizer\nwould be immediately aware only of the general concept, and not of the\nindividuals picked out by the general concept. In short, the\nfictum theory is not consistent with direct realism, which\nwas a hallmark of Ockhamist epistemology. Chatton suggested that it\nmade the most sense from an Aristotelian point of view to treat\nconcepts as accidents, and not as substances at all. On\nChatton\u2019s view, concepts are modifications of the soul, and in\nparticular my concept of \\(X\\) is nothing more than my act of thinking\nabout \\(X\\). Concepts are not intermediaries that we then think with,\nbut are rather simply our very acts of thinking themselves, i.e., my\nconcept of \\(X\\) is just my intellectio (=act of thinking) of\ninstances of \\(X\\). In response to Chatton\u2019s criticism and his\npositive alternative, Ockham abandoned his fictum theory, at\nfirst with some hesitation, wavering between this early theory and\nChatton\u2019s new intellectio model, subsequently embracing\nit more fully, and finally, in his most mature philosophical\nreflection on the topic, even arguing against the old fictum\ntheory. The stages of Ockham\u2019s change of mind are well\ndocumented in the different versions of his commentary on the\nSentences, and are even an important source for our dating of\nthose different versions.\n8. Virtues and Intentions\n\nThroughout the late 1320s and into the 1330s Chatton became\nincreasingly interested in questions of virtue and vice, the objects\nof moral acts, and the role of intentions in\n ethics.[12]\n Much of what he says follows or agrees with Scotus and opposes\nOckham.\n\nMediaeval philosophers often made much of the distinction between\nwilling or intending to do a thing and actually doing it. Let \\(A\\) be\nany action that a human being might contemplate, choose, and want to\nexecute. Then person \\(P\\)\u2019s willing \\(A\\) is\nconsidered an interior act with respect to \\(A\\), because the\nwilling is internal to the human soul. This is meant to contrast with\nthe corresponding exterior act, that is, the event that \\(P\\)\nactually executes \\(A\\). Note that \\(A\\) itself may be in\nsome sense \u2018interior\u2019, e.g., let \\(A =\\) thinking well of\nmy enemy. Then, although \\(A\\) is itself internal inasmuch as thinking\ntakes place in my mind, nevertheless we can distinguish the interior\nact of willing to think well of my enemy from the exterior\nact thinking well of my enemy. Thus \u2018interior\u2019\nand \u2018exterior\u2019 here signify primarily the distinction\nbetween choosing to do \\(A\\) and doing \\(A\\), not so much the internal\nand external activities per se.\n\nIt was Ockham\u2019s considered view, evidenced in many of his\nwritings, that only the interior act was properly regarded as\nmeritorious or sinful; the corresponding exterior act makes no moral\ndifference. Ockham is unwilling to allow external factors to play any\nsignificant role in moral evaluation. Chatton argues against this in\nmany ways, the most effective being theological: for example, Christ\nalways willed to redeem humanity, so if willing were sufficient, then\nhis exterior act of being executed on the cross was unnecessary.\nSimilarly, intending to confess would be as meritorious as actually\nconfessing. However, Chatton also points out several philosophical\ndisadvantages to Ockham\u2019s overall position.\n\nOckham\u2019s insistence that the interior act alone is subject to\nmoral appraisal leads him to pack as much as he can into the act of\nwill to be evaluated, and Chatton often criticized this strategy as\ndisingenuous. For example, Ockham seemed to think of the objects of\nmoral acts as anything the intellect needs to consider in advising the\nwill to act, including even the circumstances under which the act is\ndone; acts are finely distinguished with circumstances as a part of\ntheir identity conditions. For example, we cannot evaluate the\ninternal act \u2018willing to tell a lie\u2019, since it is too\ngeneral; to properly identify and evaluate this interior act we must\nspecify it with all its morally relevant circumstances. So, strictly\nspeaking, we should rather evaluate whether it is right to will to\ntell a lie to cover up a certain fact, to a certain person, to whom we\nare related in a certain way, etc.\n\nChatton opposed this view. The objects of moral acts can (and often\nshould) be thought of in a far more reduced sense, including only the\nexterior action of the actor himself, which the intellect approves and\nwhich the will then wills (that is, the case of virtuous\nacts). Circumstances are, properly speaking, variables existing on the\nperimeter of a moral act, while the objects and goals of acts are,\nproperly speaking, more intimate to the act itself. Chatton admits\nthat sometimes, when the will has a complex object that includes\ntemporal, causal, or locative qualifiers, these\n\u2018circumstances\u2019 can be said in a certain way to be an\nobject of the act. But such conditions, insofar as they are objects of\nthe act, are therefore not in the same way the environment\nsurrounding the act, and so are no longer really\ncircumstances in those cases. There are two practical\nimplications of this point. (1) Ockham writes and argues as though in\nhis ethics he considers only internal factors in moral evaluation, and\nexcludes the external completely, but this result is obtained only by\nsneaking in external factors through the back door, and building them\ninto the objects of the will, making them internal only by ad\nhoc stipulation. (2) If, with Chatton and against Ockham, we\nreject the idea that every act of will must include all its\ncircumstances as a partial object, we thereby make it possible to say\nthat some acts of will are intrinsically good (or bad) no matter what\ncircumstances they are done in. This possibility is important for\nOckhamist ethics, because Ockham insists that there is (and indeed\nthat there must be) at least one intrinsically good act of will, which\nhe identifies with loving God for his own sake. But if we always roll\nthe circumstances of an act up with the intended object of the act,\nthen it is possible to make any seemingly virtuous act wicked by\n\u2018in-building\u2019 bad intent, and so no act can be\nintrinsically virtuous. Chatton constructs this example against\nOckham:\n\nFor example, when I love my neighbor for the sake of God, it is\nrequired that love of God move me toward a love of neighbor. But this\nfact can be understood in two ways. (1) It can be understood that the\nobject taken as a whole is loved, that is, the entire object\nneighbor for the sake of God. In this case the act that has\nthis as an object can be done malevolently, say for the sake of\ndesirability, or more for the sake of desirability than for the glory\nof God. (2) Alternatively, my friend could be loved by me for the sake\nof God in the sense that love of God itself is the very thing that\nmoves me and causes my love of him. In this second case the love is\nvirtuous. (Quodlibet question 12, paragraph 14.)\n\n\nSimilarly, a person could love God for his own sake for the sake of\nsomething unworthy:\n\nI say that the act of \u2018loving God for his own sake\u2019 can,\nas a whole, be done malevolently; therefore, in order that it be done\nbenevolently, some additional necessary factor must be present. It is\nclear that this act can be done malevolently, since a person can have\nas his total object loving God for his own sake for the sake of\nmoney. (Quodlibet question 12, paragraph 13)\n\n\nIt might be objected that loving God for his own sake for the sake\nof money is an impossible object for the will, since good and\nevil objects or motives cancel each other out. But it is not clear how\nthis affects Chatton\u2019s point, since the human will really can\n(and sometimes does) have impossible objects and motives associated\nwith it.\n9. Conclusion\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that Walter Chatton was not a very original\nphilosopher. There is some fairness in this claim, but it is also a\nlittle misleading. What is true is that he is not as recognizably\nimportant a figure today as Ockham or Aquinas, and that his philosophy\ntends to be negative (i.e., critical) and conservative in character,\nin the following respect: in many of his writings we find him\nattacking the novel work of others, frequently Ockham, and sometimes\ndefending the more accepted work of others, frequently Scotus.\nMoreover, he did not strive to develop and set out a unique systematic\nview of reality, that is, a system of his own. But, in\nfairness, such was not the goal of philosophical theology in the\nfourteenth century. Moreover, as the examples above show, Chatton was\nphilosophically quite creative, and incisive in his attacks on\nOckham\u2019s thought. So while we find no evidence of a large\nfollowing after his death (there was no large Chattonian\n\u2018school\u2019 or \u2018movement\u2019 that we know of), he\ndid have considerable influence well into the middle of the fifteenth\ncentury in England, particularly on those who reacted strongly to\nOckham\u2019s nominalism and semantic theory, and also in the\nintricate and intense debate over future contingents.",
