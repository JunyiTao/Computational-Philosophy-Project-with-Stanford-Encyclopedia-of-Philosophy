    "main_text": "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847) || Boole\u2019s Version Of Aristotelian Logic\n3.1 Boole\u2019s Version Of Aristotelian Logic\n\n\nIn pages 15\u201359, a little more than half of the 82 pages in\nMAL, Boole focused on a slight generalization of Aristotelian\nlogic, namely augmenting its four types of categorical propositions by\npermitting the subject and/or predicate to be of the form\nnot-\\(X\\). In the chapter on conversions, such as Conversion by\nLimitation\u2014All \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\), therefore Some \\(Y\\) is\n\\(X\\)\u2014Boole found the Aristotelian classification defective in\nthat it did not treat contraries, such as not-\\(X\\), on the same\nfooting as the named classes \\(X, Y, Z\\), etc. For example, he converted No \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\) into All\n\\(Y\\) is not-\\(X\\), and All X is Y into All not-Y is not-X.\n\n\n\nFor his extended version of Aristotelian logic he stated (MAL, p. 30) a set\nof three transformation rules which he claimed allowed one to construct all valid\ntwo-line categorical arguments. These transformation rules did not appear in LT. \nIt is somewhat\ncurious that when it came to analyzing categorical syllogisms, it was only\nin the conclusion that he permitted his generalized categorical propositions\nto appear.\nAmong the vast possibilities for hypothetical syllogisms, the ones \n that he discussed were standard, with one new example added.\n",
