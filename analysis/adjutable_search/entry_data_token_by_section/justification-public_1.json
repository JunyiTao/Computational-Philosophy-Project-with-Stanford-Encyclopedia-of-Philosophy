    "main_text": "The Public Justification Principle\n2. The Public Justification Principle\n\nPublic justification theories vary. But we can categorize them\naccording to the Public Justification Principle (PJP). Define\nthe PJP as follows:\n\n\nThe Public Justification Principle (PJP): A coercive law\n\\(L\\) is justified in a public \\(P\\) if and only if each member \\(i\\)\nof \\(P\\) has sufficient reason(s) \\(R_i\\) to endorse \\(L\\).\n\n\nThe principle permits individuals 1 and 2 to have different reasons to\nendorse \\(L\\). Public justifications can consist of reasons some in\n\\(P\\) reject. But in this case, \\(L\\) is still justified for the\npublic as a whole. The justification encompasses the public but as\ndistinct individuals. The justification also need not be public as\ncommon knowledge; an individual\u2019s reason \\(R_i\\) need not be\ncommon knowledge in \\(P\\).\n\nOne can analyze the PJP through answers to the following seven\nquestions:\n\nWhat makes a reason \u201csufficient\u201d?\nHow fine-grained is the specification by \\(L\\) of the conduct\nwhich is permitted or prohibited for members of the public?\nWhat types of justificatory reasons \\(R\\) do we recognize?\nHow are the parties to public justificatory arguments\nidealized?\nWhat is the scope of the public?\nWhat are the modalities of public justification? Or: by which\nprocess is public justification achieved?\nMust we publicly justify anything other than coercion?\n\n\nAgain, public justification does not require the presentation\nof reasons. A declaration may produce or uncover a public\njustification, but societies may generate public justifications in\nother ways (see 2.7). Thus, John can have a justifying reason even if\nno one presents it to him through explicit reasoning. We must\nnonetheless explain the ideas of a reason and of a sufficient reason\nto endorse some law \\(L\\).\n",
