    "main_text": "The Conditions, again || Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives\n4.5 Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives\nArrow\u2019s independence condition requires that whenever all\nindividual preferences among a pair of alternatives are the same in\none profile as they are in another, the social preference among these\nalternatives must also be the same for the two profiles. Speaking\nfiguratively, what this means is that when the social welfare function\ngoes about the work of aggregating individual orderings, it has to\ntake each pair of alternatives separately, paying no attention to\npreferences for alternatives other than them. Some aggregation\nprocedures work this way. Pairwise majority decision does: it counts\n\\(x\\) as weakly preferred to \\(y\\), socially, if as many people weakly\nprefer \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) as the other way around, and plainly there is no\nneed to look beyond \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to find this out.\nCondition I is not Arrow\u2019s formulation. It is a simpler\none that has since become the standard in expositions of the\nimpossibility theorem. Arrow\u2019s formulation concerns choices made from\nwithin various \u201cenvironments\u201d \\(S\\) of feasible options by\nmaximizing social orderings:\n\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives (choice\nversion): For all environments \\(S\\) within \\(X\\), and all profiles\n\\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle R^*_{i}\\rangle\\) in the domain of\n\\(f\\), if \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle|S = \\langle R^*_{i}\\rangle|S\\), then\n\\(C(S)= C^*(S)\\).\n\nHere \\(C(S)\\) is the set of those options from \\(S\\) that are, in\nthe sense of the social ordering \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\), as good as\nany other; and \\(C^*(S)\\) stands for the maxima by \\(f\\langle\nR^*_{i}\\rangle\\). This is Arrow\u2019s Condition 3 (Arrow 1951 [1963]:\n27).[8] \nIain McLean (2003) finds a first statement\nof Independence, and appreciation of its significance,\nalready in (Condorcet 1785). Meanwhile much controversy has surrounded\nthis condition, and not a little confusion. Some of each can be traced\nto an example with which Arrow sought to\nmotivate it. When one candidate in an election dies\nafter polling, he wrote,\n\n[\u2026] the choice to be made among the set \\(S\\) of surviving\ncandidates should be independent of the preferences of individuals for\ncandidates not in \\(S\\). [\u2026] Therefore, we may require of our\nsocial welfare function that the choice made by society from a given\nenvironment depend only on the orderings of individuals among the\nalternatives in that environment (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 26).\n\nEvidently Arrow took this for his choice version\nof the independence condition. He continued:\n\nAlternatively stated, if we consider two sets of individual\norderings such that, for each individual, his ordering of those\nparticular alternatives in a given environment is the same each time,\nthen we require that the choice made by society from that environment\nbe the same when individual values are given by the first set of\norderings as they are when given by the second (Arrow 1951 [1963]:\n26\u201327).\n\nIt is not clear why Arrow thought the case of the dead candidate\ninvolves different values and preference profiles. As he set the\nexample up, it is natural to imagine that everybody\u2019s values and\npreferences stay the same while one candidate becomes unfeasible\n(\u201cwe\u2019d all still prefer \\(A\\), but sadly he\u2019s not with us any\nmore\u201d). Apparently, then, Arrow\u2019s example misses its mark. There\nhas been much discussion of this point in the literature. Hansson\n(1973) argues that Arrow confused his independence condition for\nanother; compare Bordes and Tideman (1991) for a contrary view. For\ndiscussion of several notions of independence whose differences have\nnot always been appreciated, see Ray (1973).\nThe following condition has also been called Independence\nof Irrelevant Alternatives:\n\n(\\(I^*\\)) For all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and all \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) and\n\\(\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle\\) in the domain of \\(f\\), if for all \\(i: xR_{i}y\\)\nif and only if \\(xR^*_{i}y\\), then \\(x f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle y\\) if and\nonly if \\(x f\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle y\\).\n\nIf the intention is to express Arrow\u2019s independence condition this\nis a mistake because \\(I^*\\), though similar in appearance\nto I, has a different content. I says that whenever\neverybody\u2019s preferences concerning a pair of options are the same in\none profile as they are in another, the social preference must also be\nthe same at the two profiles, as far as this pair is concerned. This\nis not what \\(I^*\\) says because the embedded antecedent \u2018for\nall \\(i: xR_{i}y\\) if and only if \\(xR^*_{i}y\\)\u2019 is satisfied\nnot only when everybody\u2019s preferences among \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the\nsame in \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) as they are in \\(\\langle\nR_{i}^*\\rangle\\), but in other instances as well.  For example,\nsuppose that in \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) everybody is indifferent\nbetween some social state \\(T\\) and another state \\(S\\) (in which case\nfor all \\(i\\), both \\(T R_{i} S\\) and \\(S R_{i} T\\)), while in\n\\(\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle\\) everybody strictly prefers \\(T\\) to \\(S\\)\n(for all \\(i\\), \\(T R^*_{i} S\\) but not \\(S R^*_{i} T\\)). Then the\nantecedent \u2018for all \\(i: T R_{i} S\\) if and only if \\(T R^*_{i}\nS\\)\u2019 is satisfied, although individual preferences among \\(T\\)\nand \\(S\\) are not the same in the two profiles. \\(I^*\\) sometimes\nconstrains \\(f\\) though \\(I\\) does not and it is a more demanding\ncondition.\nThe additional demands of \\(I^*\\) are sometimes excessive. Let \\(T\\) be\nthe result of reforming some tried and true status quo, \\(S\\). Now\nsuppose we favor reform if it is generally thought that change will be\nfor the better, but not otherwise. Then we will be on the lookout for\na social welfare function \\(f\\) that derives a strict social preference\nfor \\(T\\) above \\(S\\) when everybody strictly prefers \\(T\\) to \\(S\\), but a\nstrict preference for \\(S\\) above \\(T\\) when everyone is indifferent\nbetween these states. \\(I^*\\) rules out\nevery \\(f\\) that conforms to this desideratum because it requires a weak\nsocial preference for \\(T\\) to \\(S\\) in both cases or in neither.\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives might be said to\nrequire that the social comparison among any given pair of\nalternatives, say social states, depends only on individual\npreferences among this pair. This is correct but it leaves some room\nfor misunderstanding. I says that the\nonly preferences that count are those concerning just these\ntwo social states. That doesn\u2019t mean that preferences are the only\nthing that counts, though. And, indeed, as far as I is\nconcerned, non-welfare features of the two states may also make a\ndifference. \nThe doctrine that individual preferences are the only\nbasis for comparing the goodness of social states is welfarism\n(mentioned already in Section 4.3). An example\nillustrates how nasty it can be:\nIn the status quo \\(S\\), Peter is filthy rich and Paul is abjectly\npoor. Would it be better to take from Peter and give to Paul?  Let \\(T\\)\nbe the social state resulting from transferring a little of Peter\u2019s\nvast wealth to Paul. Paul prefers \\(T\\) to \\(S\\) (\u201cI need to\neat\u201d) and Peter prefers \\(S\\) to \\(T\\) (\u201cnot my\nproblem\u201d). This is one case. Compare it to another. Social state\n\\(T^*\\) arises from a different status quo \\(S^*\\), also by taking from\nPeter and giving to Paul. This time, though, their fortunes are\nreversed. In \\(S^*\\) it is Peter who is poor and Paul is the rich one,\nso this is a matter of taking from the poor to give to the rich. Even\nso, we may assume, the pattern of Peter\u2019s and Paul\u2019s preferences is\nthe same in the second case as it is in the first, because each of\nthem prefers to have more for himself than to have less. Paul prefers\n\\(T^*\\) to \\(S^*\\) (\u201cI need another Bugatti\u201d) and Peter\nprefers \\(S^*\\) to \\(T^*\\) (\u201cwish it were my problem\u201d). Since\neverybody\u2019s preferences are the same in the two cases, welfarism\nrequires that the relative social goodness is the same as well. In\nparticular, it allows us to count \\(T\\) socially better than \\(S\\) only if\nwe also count \\(T^*\\) better than \\(S^*\\).  Whatever we think about taking\nfrom the rich to give to the poor, though, taking from the poor to\ngive to the rich is quite another thing. As Samuelson said of a\nsimilar case, \u201c[o]ne need not be a doctrinaire egalitarian to be\nspeechless at this requirement\u201d (Samuelson 1977: 83).\nCondition I does not express welfarism. Applied to this\nexample, I states that there is to be no change in the social\ncomparison among the status quo \\(S\\) and the result \\(T\\) of\nredistribution unless Peter\u2019s preferences among these states change,\nor Paul\u2019s do (assume they are the only people involved). In this\nsense, the social preference among these states may be said to depend\n\u201conly\u201d on individual preferences among them. I\nsays the same about \\(S^*\\) and \\(T^*\\) or about any other pair of\nalternatives. But I is silent about any relationship between\nthe social comparison among \\(S\\) and \\(T\\), on the one hand, and the\nsocial comparison among \\(S^*\\) and \\(T^*\\), on the other. In particular,\nit leaves a social welfare function free to count \\(T\\) socially better\nthan \\(S\\) (for increasing equality), while also counting \\(T^*\\)\nworse than \\(S^*\\) (for decreasing equality). Intuitively\nspeaking, I allows a social welfare function to \u201cshift\ngears\u201d as we go from one pair of social states to the next,\ndepending on the non-welfare features encountered there. \nThe condition that expresses welfarism is:\n\nStrong Neutrality (SN): For all alternatives \\(x\\),\n\\(y\\), \\(z\\) and \\(w\\), and all profiles \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle\nR_{i}^*\\rangle\\): IF for all \\(i\\): \\(xR_{i}y\\) if and only if \\(zR^*_{i}w\\),\nand \\(yR_{i}x\\) if and only if \\(wR^*_{i}z\\), THEN \\(x f\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle y\\) if and only if \\(z f\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle w\\), and \\(y\nf\\langle R_{i}\\rangle x\\) if and only if \\(w f\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle\nz\\).\n\n SN is more demanding than \nI.[9]\nI requires consistency for each\npair of alternatives separately, as we go from one profile in the\ndomain to the next. SN also requires this, but in addition it requires consistency as\nwe go from one pair to the next, whether that is within a\nsingle profile or among several different ones. This is\nhow SN keeps non-welfare features from making any difference:\nby compelling the social welfare function to treat any two pairs of\nalternatives the same way, if the pattern of individual preference is\nthe same for both.\nSince \\(I^*\\) and SN are logically stronger than I,\nobviously a version of Arrow\u2019s theorem can be had using either one of\nthem instead of I. Such a theorem will be less interesting,\nthough\u2014not only because it is logically weaker but also because,\nas we have seen, these more demanding conditions often are unreasonable.\nThe meaning of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives is\nnot easily grasped, and its ramifications are not immediately obvious.\nIt is therefore surprising to see just how little has been said, over\nthe many decades that have passed since Arrow published his famous\ntheorem, to justify imposing this condition on social welfare\nfunctions. Let us turn, now, to some arguments for and against.\nWe have discussed Arrow\u2019s attempt to motivate I using the\nexample of the dead candidate in an election. In the second edition\nof Social Choice and Individual Values he offered another\nrationale. Independence, he argued, embodies the principle\nthat welfare judgments are to be based on observable behavior. Having\nexpressed approval for Bergson\u2019s use of indifference maps, Arrow\ncontinued:\n\nThe Condition of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives extends\nthe requirement of observability one step farther. Given the set of\nalternatives available for society to choose among, it could be\nexpected that, ideally, one could observe all preferences among the\navailable alternatives, but there would be no way to observe\npreferences among alternatives not feasible for society. (Arrow 1963:\n110)\n\nArrow seems to be saying that social decisions have to be made on\nthe basis of preferences for feasible alternatives because these are\nthe only ones that are observable. Arguably, though, this is\ninsufficient support. Arrow\u2019s choice version of Independence,\nas we have seen, concerns all environments \\(S\\). The\nobservability argument, though, apparently just concerns some\n\u201cgiven\u201d feasible alternatives. See Hansson (1973: 38) on\nthis point.\nGerry Mackie (2003) argues that there has been equivocation on the\nnotion of irrelevance. It is true that we often take nonfeasible\nalternatives to be irrelevant. That presumably is why, in elections,\nwe do not ordinarily put the names of dead people on ballots, along\nwith those of the live candidates. But I also excludes from\nconsideration information on preferences for alternatives that, in an\nordinary sense, are relevant. An example illustrates Mackie\u2019s\npoint. George W. Bush, Al Gore, and Ralph Nader ran in the United\nStates presidential election of 2000. Say we want to know whether\nthere was a social preference for Gore above Bush.  I\nrequires that this question be answerable independently of whether the\npeople preferred either of them to, say, Abraham Lincoln, or preferred\nGeorge Washington to Lincoln. This seems right. Neither Lincoln nor\nWashington ran for President that year. They were, intuitively,\nirrelevant alternatives.  But I also requires that the\nranking of Gore with respect to Bush should be independent of voters\u2019\npreferences for Nader, and this does not seem right because\nhe was on the ballot and, in the ordinary sense, he was a\nrelevant alternative to them. Certainly Arrow\u2019s observability\ncriterion does not rule out using information on preferences for\nNader. They were as observable as any in that election.\nA different rationale has been suggested for\nimposing I specifically\nin the case of voting. Many voting procedures are known to present\nopportunities for voters to manipulate outcomes by misrepresenting\ntheir preferences. Section 5.2 discusses the\nexample of Borda counting, which allows voters to promote their own\nfavorite candidates by strategically putting others\u2019 favorites at the\nbottom of their lists. Borda counting, it will be seen,\nviolates I. Proofs of the Gibbard-Sattherthwaite theorem\n(Gibbard 1973, Sattherthwaite 1975) associate vulnerability to\nstrategic voting systematically with violation of I, and Iain\nMcLean argues on this ground that voting methods ought to satisfy this\ncondition: \u201cTake out [I] and you have gross\nmanipulability\u201d (McLean 2003: 16). This matter of strategic\nvoting did not play a part in Arrow\u2019s presentation of the\nimpossibility theorem, though, and was not dealt with seriously in\nthe literature until after its publication. See the entry\non social choice theory for discussion\nof this important theme in contemporary theory of social choice.\n",
