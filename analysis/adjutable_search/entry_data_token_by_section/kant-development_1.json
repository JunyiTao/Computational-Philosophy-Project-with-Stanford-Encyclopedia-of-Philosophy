After the\ndeath of his maternal grandfather (1729), the Kants suffered from a\nseries of events that would eventually ruin the family. The death\nleft the harness-shop downtown without leadership and Anna\u2019s mother\nwithout a provider. To compensate, the Kant\u2019s moved into the home of\nAnna\u2019s mother on the outskirts of the city, in\nthe Sattlerstrasse, the saddler-street, a less prosperous\npart of the city. The saddlers, a guild distinct from harness-makers\nwhile producing similar goods, did not welcome the\ncompetition. Johann Kant became the target of the saddle-makers\u2019\nhostility, and the business failed to prosper in the new\nlocation. Income steadily declined, and further hardship occurred\nwith the death of Anna Regina (1737). Just thirteen years old,\nImmanuel must have keenly felt the loss of his first tutor regarding\nnature and religious \nsentiment.[7]\nWhen Immanuel was six or seven, he went to\nthe Hospitalschule, a grammar school at the local clinic,\nwhose teacher was a Pietist candidate in theology. In 1732, Pastor\nSchulz, who knew the child through Anna, arranged for Immanuel, now\neight, to continue his education at the Collegium\nFridericianum. For a child of working-class parents, such as Kant,this was a\nfortunate opportunity. Instead of the traditional path,\napprenticeship at his father\u2019s shop and the eventual inheritance of\nthe workshop, Immanuel was given the opportunity for higher education,\nunder the assumption he would pursue a religious or civil\nvocation. Practically speaking, this would raise Kant in the eyes of\nsociety and offer him the opportunity to raise himself above the rank\nand economics into which he was born.  One might conjecture that the\nsensitive and bright Kant would look forward to the possibility of\nadvancement. Unfortunately, the tutelage he received there was a\nrather more stringent form of Pietism than the one he found at home\nunder the instruction of his mother.\nKant would later judge the time of youth as the hardest years of\nlife, ruled by discipline, loneliness, and lack of freedom\n(Lectures on Pedagogy, w. 1776\u201387, p. 1803;\n9:485.13\u201317). School, at the Collegium, was held six\ndays a week. Sundays were spent with homework and prayer. Primary\nsubjects of instruction were Latin and religion. Only male pupils were\nadmitted; there was no way to meet girls or socialize, and, as the son\nof a harness-maker, Kant was already at a significant social\ndisadvantage. The later stages of his primary education (what we \nwould call high school) definitely changed his life for the\nworse. Immanuel was to attend high school until 1740, when he was\nsixteen.\nMoreover, the education was not even of great quality. Only rather\nelementary math was offered, and natural philosophy (biology,\nchemistry, geology, physics, and astronomy) was not taught at all.\nPupils were groomed for administrative and clerical careers, so\nscience was considered a luxury not to be indulged. The sciences were\nalso suspect from the theological perspectives of his instructors.\nPietist indifference to inquiry and fundamentalist denial of facts\nresulted in contemptuous hostility\ntoward science. As late as the 1750s, the clergy rejected the\nheliocentric system and frowned on Newton\u2019s celestial mechanics as\nfiction. Pietist theologians such as Franz Budde (1667\u20131729),\nJoachim Lange (1670\u20131744), and Andreas R\u00fcdiger\n(1673\u20131731) argued that the Bible teaches everything worth\nknowing of nature. The later Pietist thinker Christian August Crusius\n(1715\u201375) essentially concurred. For Pietism, particularly in\nits Saxon center, Halle, education was for practical management of\nlife\u2019s affairs, not an endeavor with intrinsic worth. Mathematics was\nuseful for bookkeeping but worthless for describing reality. Physics\nwas acceptable as long as its findings did not undermine the\nBible. As independent research programs, however, the sciences were\ndeemed wellsprings of \nheresy.[8]\n Standard curriculum included a heavy dose\nof theology, catechism memorization and biblical stories. Although\nthe school did offer a variety of topics: Latin, Greek, Hebrew,\nlogic, history (both church and philosophy) and geography, the\nprimary use of this instruction was in preparation for further\ntheological study at the university. Education at\nthe Collegium was always in the service of the Pietist\nprogrammatic, conversion and salvation of souls.\nIn Halle, Pietism found its epicenter and religious temperament. In\nK\u00f6nigsberg, however, Pietism\u2014at the extent of its influence in\nthe 1730s\u2014was moderated by the task to proselytize to the\nmainstream. Under Schulz\u2019s guidance, ideological fervor was reined in\nby the need for flexibility when making converts.  Thus in K\u00f6nigsberg,\nit was not as monolithic as further south.  With his earliest\neducation at the Collegium, Kant was to suffer from the more\nsevere form of pedagogical ideals. During his university years, he\nwould enjoy more moderate educational ideals, as Kant\u2019s later\nuniversity teacher, Martin Knutzen (1713\u201351), illustrates. A\npassionate Pietist, Knutzen studied Newton and discussed the ideas of\nLeibniz and Wolff\u2014possible for Pietists in East Prussia, but\nimpossible for Pietists in Central Prussia and Saxony.\nDuring high school this moderation was not felt. The instructors at\nthe Collegium were stern. Pietist schooling involved a\nrigorous schedule, strict adherence to religious dogma, and\ninstruction by repetitive drills. The school\u2019s goals were two-fold, to\nsave it\u2019s pupils from \u201creligious corruption\u201d and to\nimprove their \u201cworldly well-being\u201d (Kuehn 2001a:\n46). Strict adherence to regimen, dogma and practical applications\nwere essential to these two goals. A former classmate, David Ruhnken,\ncriticized the \u201cdiscipline of the fanatics\u201d (letter to\nKant 10 Mar. 1771; 10:117.15); another classmate and life-long friend,\nTheodor Hippel (1741\u201396), spoke of Kant\u2019s \u201cterror and\nfear\u201d whenever Kant would later recall the \u201cslavery of his\nyouth\u201d (Malter 1992: 95; tr. Kuehn 2001a: 45).\nTypical penalties for infractions, next to physical punishment,\nwere what would be called \u201cguilt trips\u201d today. In contrast\nto Catholicism (where sins are forgiven in confession), Protestant\nsalvation depends on grace. The faithful cannot rely on a ritual for\nexoneration; non-Catholic Christians steadily collect sins. They can\nonly do their best and better their odds for deliverance by remorseful\nintrospection. Pietism honed remorse into a fine art. Essential to\nsalvation is a sense of guilt\u2014more an emotion, actually, than a\nsense (Schuldgef\u00fchl). God\u2019s grace will wipe the slate clean,\nbut grace is neither predictable nor verifiable. The only measure, if\nthere is any, is the intensity of shame\u2014the stronger the\ncultivated feelings of guilt, the better the chances for\nsalvation. The education at the Collegium institutionalized\nthis guilt and sought to properly instruct its charges with a contrite\nspirit and sense of conservative propriety. One should feel an\nenthusiastic guilt and sense of turpitude in an effort to become a\nbetter citizen, both spiritually and practically.\nWith the exception of a certain Heydenreich, a friendly Latinist\nwho introduced Kant to Lucretius\u2019s De rerum natura (Borowski\n1804: 38\u20139), high school stunted Kant\u2019s growth. He excelled at\nLatin, an emphasis at the school, and Greek, but struggled with\ntheology and arithmetic. He appears to have enjoyed classic authors\nunder the guidance of Heydenreich and many thought he would take up\nclassics at university.\nThe lack of scientific training would hamper his later explorations\nof nature. He tried to make up for it at the university in 1740, but\nhis mathematics instructor, Privatdozent Christian Ammon\n(1696\u20131742) was ignorant of the calculus (Kuehn 2001b:\n13\u201316)\u2014an essential tool for understanding the\ncutting-edge physical research of the day. Kant\u2019s quantitative skills\nwere to remain substandard; when he calculated, the results usually\ncame out all wrong (Adickes 1924a: 73\u201383; 1924b:\n1:38\u20139). This lack in mathematical training played into his\nbelated comprehension of Newton\u2019s work, yet did not harm Kant\u2019s\nappreciation for him. Such a substandard education in arithmetic,\nphilosophy and the sciences were the norm at the Collegium\nFridericianum, and Kant would have to continually work to make up\nfor this early deficit.\nHence Kant\u2019s later contributions to natural science would have to\nremain of a conceptual sort. They amounted to brilliant\naper\u00e7us\u2014but it was later physicists, not Kant, who articulated\nthem rigorously and substantiated them empirically.\nHigh school may have also affected the development of Kant\u2019s\nethics.  In the absence of data, this effect is conjectural. Still,\ncommon sense suggests that his later interest in dignity and the value\nof autonomy might have been influenced by the treatment he suffered\nand witnessed in school. It makes sense that a thinker who recalls the\n\u201cslavery of his youth\u201d with \u201cterror and fear\u201d\nwould insist that treating humanity as an end, instead of a means\nonly, is a Categorical Imperative.\nMoreover, these experiences may also explain Kant\u2019s exclusion of\nemotion from ethics; a curious exclusion, given his emphasis of the\nimportance of the good will (Foundations of the Metaphysics of\nMorals 1785; 4:393\u20135). Anna Kant died in 1737, when\nImmanuel was thirteen. From then on, the sensitive teenager associated\n\u201cmorality under the guidance of feeling\u201d only negatively.\nThis may be due, in part, to the daily exposure to the guilt\nassociated with the doctrines of morality to which Immanuel was\nexposed at the Collegium. And without a mother as an\naffectionate and sane counterweight, the oppressiveness and negative\nassociations of guilt and morality must have taken its toll. He\nsuffered the pious whim of teachers, eager to instill feelings of\nguilt for the sake of salvation.  His later contempt for emotion is\narguably unjustified, but his upbringing suggests an explanation.\n",
