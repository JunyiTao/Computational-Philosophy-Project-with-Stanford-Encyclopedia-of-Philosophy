    "main_text": "The Natural Kind Defense\n5. The Natural Kind Defense\n\nOne possible defense was sketched by Kelly et al. (2007), and\ndeveloped in more detail by Kumar (2015, 2016) and Stich (2019). The\ncore idea is that the term \u201cmoral judgment\u201d can be viewed\nas a natural kind term. In his widely discussed paper, \u201cThe\nMeaning of \u2018Meaning\u2019\u201d, Hilary Putnam (1975) argued\nthat it is the job of empirical science to determine the essential\nfeatures of natural kinds like water and gold, and that these\nessential features can be used to specify the meaning of the term\ndenoting the kind. Devitt (1996) and Kornblith (1998), have provided\ninsightful accounts of how this process works. Very roughly, their\nstory goes like this. To begin, the scientist focuses on what seem to\nbe intuitively obvious examples of the kind in question. She seeks to\ndiscover properties that are shared by most of these intuitively\nobvious examples, and that are absent in most things that,\nintuitively, are not members of the kind. If this process leads to the\ndiscovery of a cluster of properties that is present in most intuitive\nexamples and absent in most cases that, intuitively, are not members\nof the kind, the scientist then hypothesizes that this cluster of\nproperties are nomologically linked and that they are the essential\nfeatures of the kind.\n\nKelly and colleagues suggested that this idea might be useful in\ninterpreting Turiel\u2019s work. On this interpretation, the ordinary\nterm \u201cmoral judgment\u201d is hypothesized to be a\npsychological natural kind term, and it is the job of psychology to\ndetermine the essential features of the psychological natural kind\nthat the term denotes. The obvious way to do this would be for\npsychologists to discover a cluster of nomologically linked properties\nthat are shared by most instances of what they take to be intuitively\nclear cases of moral judgments, one or more of which is missing in\nmost cases of judgments that they intuitively take not to be\nmoral judgments. This, Kelly and colleagues suggested, looks to be\nexactly what Turiel and his colleagues have done. Turiel and other\nsocial domain theorists take some of the transgressions they use in\ntheir experiments to be intuitively obvious cases of moral\ntransgressions, and these are judged, by most participants, young and\nold, to be authority independent, and generalizable to different\nlocations and to different times. The experimenters take other\ntransgressions to be intuitively obvious cases of conventional\ntransgressions, and these are judged, by most participants, to be\nauthority dependent and not generalizable to different locations or to\ndifferent times. If all of that is true, then\u2014for the reasons\nset out by Putnam, Devitt, and Kornblith\u2014Turiel and his\ncolleagues can plausibly claim to have shown that both moral judgments\nand conventional judgments are indeed psychological natural kinds, and\nto have discovered the essential features of those kinds. And that\nwould provide an excellent reason to think that the pattern of\ncriterion judgments that is hypothesized to identify moral judgments\nactually does identify moral judgments, and that the pattern of\ncriterion judgments that is hypothesized to identify conventional\njudgments actually does identify conventional judgments.\n\nFor this natural kind defense to work it must, of course, be the case\nthat the features that are used to identify moral and conventional\njudgments actually do form nomological clusters, and that most\nintuitive cases of moral judgment evoke the moral pattern of criterion\njudgments while most intuitive cases of conventional judgment evoke\nthe conventional pattern of criterion judgments. Do the empirical\nfindings support the natural kind defense? There is a large literature\nindicating that they do. The pattern of criterion judgments that the\nnatural kind defense requires has been found in studies with\nparticipants ranging in age from toddlers to adults (Nucci &\nTuriel 1978; Smetana 1981; Nucci & Nucci 1982). It has also been\nfound in participants of a number of different nationalities and\nreligions (for reviews see Tisak 1995; Smetana 1993; Nucci 2001) and\nin children with a variety of developmental disorders, including\nautism (Blair 1996; Blair, Monson, & Frederickson 2001; Nucci\n& Herman 1982; Smetana, Kelly, & Twentyman 1984; Smetana,\nToth, et al. 1999). There have been a few studies that did not fit the\nexpected pattern, notably Nucci and Turiel (1993) who found that\northodox Jewish children judged that a variety of intuitively\nnon-moral religious norm transgressions were authority independent\nthough they were not generalizable, and Nichols (2002) who found that\nAmerican college students judged that an intuitively conventional\netiquette transgression was authority independent though not\ngeneralizable. But as Kumar notes, the nomological clustering that the\nnatural kind defense requires \u201cis not supposed to be\nexceptionless\u201d (Kumar 2015: \u00a75; 2016: \u00a73.2).\n\nHowever, in almost all of the studies cited in the previous paragraph,\nthe intuitively moral transgressions used were the sorts of behavior\nthat would be familiar to children. Kelly et al. (2007) dub them\n\u201cschoolyard\u201d transgressions. This was also the case in\nBlair\u2019s (1995) study in which the experimental participants\nincluded incarcerated psychopathic murderers! In a pair of more recent\nstudies Kelly et al. (2007) and Fessler, Barrett, et al. (2015) used a\nrange of more \u201cgrown-up\u201d intuitively moral transgressions\nincluding whipping, slavery, stealing, wife beating and rape. Both\nstudies found fairly dramatic departures from the pattern of criterion\njudgments that the natural kind defense requires.\n [11]\n Stich (2019) argues that these studies pose a major challenge to the\nnatural kind defense of the claim that Turiel\u2019s\n\u201cmoral\u201d pattern of criterion judgments can be used to\nidentify genuine moral judgments. But both the methods and the\nanalyses used in the Kelly et al. and the Fessler et al. studies have\nbeen challenged, and these critiques have led to lively\n debates.[12]\n So perhaps the best conclusion to be drawn at this writing is that\nthe success of the natural kind defense is very much an open\nquestion.\n",
