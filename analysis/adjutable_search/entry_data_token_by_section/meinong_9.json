    "main_text": "Object Theory \u2014 Ontology beyond Being and Non-Being || A Meinongian Table of Categories\n5.3 A Meinongian Table of Categories\n5.3.1 Outside-Being as a Borderline-Case of a Mode of Being\n\nMeinong repeatedly ponders the question of whether outside-being is a\nfurther mode of being or just a lack of being (1904b, \u00a74; 1910,\n\u00a712; 1917, \u00a72; 1978: 153\u20134, 261, 358\u20139, 377). He\nfinally interprets outside-being as a borderline case of a kind of\nbeing (1910: 80 [62]). Every object is prior to its\napprehension, i.e., objects are pre-given [vorgegeben] to the\nmind, and this pre-givenness is due do the (ontological) status of\noutside-being. According to Meinong\u2019s distinction between\njudgements that state that something is so and so\n[Soseinsurteile] and judgements about the mode of being of an\nobject [Seinsurteile], the most general determination of\nso-being is being an object, and the most general\ndetermination of being is outside-being. The concept of an\nobject cannot be defined in terms of a qualified genus and\ndifferentia. It does not have a negative counterpart, and\ncorrelatively outside-being does not seem to have a negation either\n(1921a, Section 2 B: 102\u20137).\n\nBut this claim is challenged in lecture notes from 1917/18 (1978:\n377\u20138), where Meinong discusses cases of negative outside-being,\nfor example so-called defective objects \u2014 objects that\ninvolve paradoxes like the liar or the apprehension of inapprehensible\nobjects. (See also 1917, \u00a72: 22\u20134 [20\u20131])\nwhere he states that there is a typical case of something that lacks\noutside-being, namely a round square concretely presented.) In lecture\nnotes from 1910 (1978: 227), Meinong also mentions absurdities,\nexamples of nonsense [Unsinn], and tries to contrast them\nwith cases of a kind of inconsistency [Widersinn] like the\nround square. Meinong tentatively defines such an inconsistency as\nsomething that involves incompatible determinations\n[Unvertr\u00e4gliches] but is still understandable, whereas\nnonsense would be something that cannot be understood at all. \u201cA\nblot of ink fiddled down on a piano\u201d, \u201cgreen\nvirtue\u201d, and \u201can automobile paved with therefore\u201d\nseem to be examples of incomprehensible nonsense. In the end, however,\nMeinong gives up the attempt to distinguish nonsense from mere\ninconsistency. Meinong\u2019s point, rather, is that although the\nfirst two examples mix determinations of different groups, his theory\nof objects can describe them as based on incompatibility, and it gives\nan account of this kind of incompatibility, whereas the last example\nhas only linguistic but no object theoretical relevance (cf. also\n1978: 385\u20136).\n5.3.2 Meinong\u2019s Non-Intentionalistic Table of Categories\n\nIf one puts the paradoxical and nonsensical cases aside,\nMeinong\u2019s table of categories according to the modes of being\nlooks as follows:\n\n\n\n\nI. Objects\n\n(Everything is an object, and every object has outside-being\n[Au\u00dfersein]) \n\nI.A. Objects that have being\nI.B. Objects that do not have being \n\nI.A.1.\n\nReal objects\n\n(which exist as well as subsist)\nI.A.2.\n\nIdeal objects\n\n(which only subsist)\nI.B.1.\n\nObjects that have non-being\nI.B.2.\n\nObjects that are not determined with respect to being \n\n\u2193\n\u2193\nI.B.1.a.\n\nNoncontradictory Objects\nI.B.1.b.\n\nContradictory Objects\n\u2193 \n\nComplete objects\nComplete objects\nComplete objects\nIncomplete objects; non-being is \u201cexplicitly\npresupposed\u201d ([ausdr\u00fccklich vorgegeben], 1915:\n740)\nComplete or incomplete objects\nIncomplete objects; not contradictorily determined and their\nnon-being is not \u201cexplicitly presupposed\u201d \n\nExamples:\n\nDoughnuts (like the one on the table in front of me), tables, stars,\netc.; occurrences such as my judging or desiring now\nExamples:\n\nThe objective (state of affairs) of my doughnut being on the table;\nthe state of affairs of my doughnut not being in the fridge; the\nnumber of doughnuts in front of me\nExamples:\n\nThe doughnut on the table but which is made of chocolate instead of\nvanilla; the state of affairs of my doughnut being in the fridge; the\nPlatonistic idea of \u201cdoughnuthood\u201d (if Platonism\nfails)\nExamples:\n\nThe mountain made of doughnuts; the golden mountain; the perpetual\nmotion machine\nExamples:\n\nThe ring-shaped doughnut without a hole; the round square; the set of\nall sets; the greatest prime number; the doughnut on the table but\nwith some property in addition to its complete set of\nproperties\nExamples:\n\nThe doughnut as such; the \u201cauxiliary\u201d object: my doughnut\n(see Sections 5.4.3 and 6 below); the object whose only property is\nbeing blue; The Triangle  \n\n\n\nBeing has two modes, to wit existence, which is linked with\ntime, and mere subsistence, which is timeless (1910: 64\n[52]). Nevertheless Meinong states that existence implies\nsubsistence, and non-subsistence implies non-existence (1896: 250;\n1910: 74 [58]; 1915, \u00a711: 63). All objects that subsist\n(and a fortiori all objects that exist) are completely\ndetermined, but not all complete objects exist or have being (1915,\n\u00a7\u00a725\u20137: 169\u2013202).\n\nThe ideal\u2013real distinction is to be explained by the terms\n\u201cexistence\u201d, \u201csubsistence\u201d, and \u201cmere\nsubsistence\u201d. In 1978, (252\u20133, 366\u20137), Meinong calls\nthose objects real (1) which exist (= \u201cexternally\nreal\u201d [\u00e4u\u00dferlich real]), my chair or my\ndesiring, for example, or (2) which could exist by their nature (=\ninternal reality [innere Realit\u00e4t], ibid.) as,\nfor example, my golden chair. Physical and psychological things as\nwell are real. If an object that subsists also exists, it is a\nreal object, but if an object that subsists cannot exist\n(i.e., can merely subsist), it is an ideal object. Hence, ideal\nobjects can never correctly be said to exist. There are also ideal\nobjects that do not subsist, for example the being of a biangle or the\nnon-identity between the morning star and the evening star. Absences,\nlimits, the number (of some existent or non-existent) chairs,\nsimilarities, and objectives are further examples of ideal objects\n(1899, \u00a76; 1910, \u00a712).\n",
