A Brief History of Descartes\u2019 Scientific Work\n\nDespite his fame as a philosopher of purely metaphysical problems,\nsuch as the relation of the soul and body, or God\u2019s existence,\nit would not be incorrect to conclude that Descartes was a scientist\nfirst and a philosopher second. Not only did Descartes\u2019 interest\nand work in science extend throughout his entire scholarly career, but\nsome of his most important metaphysical works (e.g., the\nMeditations) were prompted by a perceived need to equip his\nscience with a metaphysical foundation that would be acceptable to the\nAristotelian-influenced Scholastics. Yet, one must be careful not to\nimpose modern conceptions on the \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d of\nearlier centuries, for much seventeenth century science was\npractically indistinguishable from the more speculative metaphysics of\nthe era (and thus the label \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d is\nparticularly apt for describing seventeenth century science). In fact,\nmuch of Descartes\u2019 science is only part of a much larger system\nthat embraces all areas of philosophical investigation, including both\nhis physics and metaphysics.\n\nThe awakening of Descartes\u2019 interest in physics is often dated\nto late 1618, when Descartes first met Isaac Beeckman, an amateur\nscientist and mathematician who championed the new\n\u201cmechanical\u201d philosophy. The mechanical philosophy\u2019s\nexplanation of natural phenomena, which Descartes quickly adopted,\nrejected the use of Scholastic substantial forms (see\n Section 2).\n Rather, the mechanical approach favored a contact or impact model of\nthe interaction of small, unobservable \u201ccorpuscles\u201d of\nmatter (which possess only a limited number of mainly geometric\nproperties, such as size, motion, shape, etc.). Over the course of the\nnext decade, Descartes worked on a large number of problems in both\nscience and mathematics, with particular emphasis on the theory of\nlight, mechanics (including hydrostatics), and the free-fall of\nterrestrial bodies. Much of Descartes\u2019 output at this time is\nboth highly mathematical and concerns only specific physical problems,\nnot unlike the work of his contemporary Galileo. One of the\naccomplishments of these years includes his discovery of the law of\nrefraction, often called Snell\u2019s law: when light passes from one\nmedium into another, the sine of the angle of incidence maintains a\nconstant ratio to the sine of the angle of refraction. By the\nbeginning of the 1630s, however, Descartes embarked on a more\nambitious plan to construct a systematic theory of knowledge,\nincluding physics. The result was The World (1633), an\nimportant text in that it essentially contains the blueprints of the\nmechanical/geometric physics, as well as the vortex theory of\nplanetary motion, that Descartes would continue to refine and develop\nover the course of his scientific career. Before publishing the\ntreatise, however, he learned of the Church\u2019s (1633)\ncondemnation of Galileo for promoting Copernicanism, which prompted\nDescartes to withdraw his work from publication (since Descartes also\nadvanced Copernicanism in The World). In the 1630s, the\npublication of the Geometry, the Optics, and the\nMeteorology, along with a philosophical introduction,\nDiscourse on the Method (1637) further presented Cartesian\nhypotheses on such topics as the law of refraction, vision, and the\nrainbow. Yet, besides a brief sketch of his metaphysics and physics in\nthe Discourse (Parts IV and V), a comprehensive treatment of\nhis physics had to await the 1644 publication of the Principles of\nPhilosophy. This work not only represents Descartes\u2019 most\nfully developed and exhaustive investigation of physics, it also\nprovides the metaphysical underpinnings of his physical system (in\nPart I). As an embodiment of his mature views, the Principles\nwill thus form the basis of our examination of Cartesian physics.\n1.1 A Note on the Primary Texts\n\nThe translations, with minor variations, are from Descartes 1979,\n1983, 1984a, 1984b, 1991, but the passages are identified with respect\nto the Adam and Tannery edition of the Oeuvres de Descartes\n(1976) according to the standard convention: \u201cAT\u201d,\nfollowed by volume and page number. Passages cited from the\nPrinciples, however, will be identified by \u201cPr\u201d,\nfollowed by volume and article, and with a final \u201cF\u201d\nindicating the inclusion of new material from the French translation\nof 1647.\n1.2 Suggested Readings\n\nFor recent in-depth examinations of Descartes\u2019 physics, see\nGarber 1992a and Des Chene 1996. Schuster 2014 covers Descartes\u2019\nearly physics, from 1618 to 1633. A concise survey of Cartesian\nphysics can be found in Garber 1992b. The scientific career of\nDescartes, with special emphasis on his physics, is presented in Shea\n1991; see also Gaukroger, Schuster, Sutton 2000 for the many aspects\nof his natural philosophy. Gaukroger 2002 examines the Principles\nof Philosophy, especially the physics, whereas Slowik 2002\nfocuses primarily on Cartesian space and relational motion. The\nhistorical background to much in Descartes\u2019 physics is also\ntreated in Ariew 2011. On methodology in Descartes\u2019 natural\nphilosophy, see Smith 2009, while Hattab 2009 and Machamer and McGuire\n2009 cover the development of various ideas important to his physics.\nOn the reception of Descartes\u2019 work and early forms of\nCartesianism, with special attention devoted to physics, see Schmaltz\n2005, 2017, and Dobre 2017.\n2. The Strategy of Cartesian Physics\n\nLike many of his contemporaries (e.g., Galileo and Gassendi),\nDescartes devised his mechanical theory in large part to refute the\nwidely held Aristotelian-based Scholastic explanation of natural\nphenomena that employed an ontology of \u201csubstantial forms\u201d\nand \u201cprimary matter\u201d. Briefly, Scholastic natural\nphilosophy viewed a material body as comprising both an inert\nproperty-less substratum (primary matter) and a quality-bearing\nessence (substantial form), with the latter providing the body\u2019s\ncausal capacities. A quantity of matter, for example, possesses\nweight, color, texture, and all of the other bodily properties, only\nin virtue of being conjoined with a determinate form (of a billiard\nball, chair, etc.). Descartes admits that he had earlier held such a\nview of gravity, envisioning the substantial form as a kind of\ngoal-directed (teleological) mental property of bodies: \u201cwhat\nmakes it especially clear that my idea of gravity was taken largely\nfrom the idea I had of the mind is the fact that I thought that\ngravity carried bodies towards the centre of the earth as if it had\nsome knowledge of the centre within itself. For this surely could not\nhappen without knowledge, and there can be any knowledge except in a\nmind\u201d (AT VII 442). In a revealing passage from The\nWorld, Descartes declares the Scholastic hypothesis to be both an\nunintelligible and inadequate methodological approach to explaining\nnatural phenomena:\n\nIf you find it strange that I make no use of the qualities one calls\nheat, cold, moistness, and dryness\u2026, as the philosophers [of\nthe schools] do, I tell you that these qualities appear to me to be in\nneed of explanation, and if I am not mistaken, not only these four\nqualities, but also all the others, and even all of the forms of\ninanimate bodies can be explained without having to assume anything\nelse for this in their matter but motion, size, shape, and the\narrangement of their parts (AT XI 25\u201326).\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 plan is to reduce the class of metaphysically suspect\nproperties, such as heat, weight, taste, to the empirically\nquantifiable attributes of size, shape, and motion. In other words,\nDescartes intends to replace the \u201cmentally\u201d influenced\ndepiction of physical qualities in Scholastic natural philosophy with\na theory that requires only the properties of extension to describe\nthe manifest order of the natural world. Consequently, Descartes was\nan early exponent of what came to be known as the\n\u201cprimary/secondary\u201d property distinction, a concept that\nwas very much \u201cin the air\u201d among the critics of\nScholasticism.\n\nNevertheless, even if Descartes\u2019 mechanistic natural philosophy\nshunned the metaphysics of substantial forms, his underlying\nmethodology or approach to science remained very close to the\nScholastic tradition. By the time of the composition of the\nPrinciples, Descartes had formulated a method that, like the\nScholastics, strived to explain natural phenomena based on the\nallegedly simple and irrefutable \u201cfacts\u201d and/or\nobservations, drawn from rational reflection on concepts or from\neveryday experience, about the most fundamental aspects of reality.\nThese supposedly basic facts thereby provide the requisite\nmetaphysical foundation for his physical hypotheses: in other words,\none proceeds from our \u201cclear and distinct\u201d knowledge of\ngeneral metaphysical items, such as the nature of material substance\nand its modes, to derive particular conclusions on specific types of\nphysical processes, for instance the laws of nature. This method of\nconducting science is quite contrary to the modern approach, needless\nto say, since modern scientists do not first engage in a metaphysical\nsearch for first principles on which to base their work. Yet, this is\nexactly the criticism that Descartes leveled at Galileo\u2019s\nphysics (in a letter to Mersenne from 1638): \u201cwithout having\nconsidered the first causes of nature, [Galileo] has merely looked for\nthe explanations of a few particular effects, and he has thereby built\nwithout foundations\u201d (AT II 380; see, also, the Preface to the\nFrench translation of the Principles, AT IXB 5\u201311). The\nstructure of the Principles, Descartes\u2019 most\ncomprehensive scientific work, reflects these priorities: Part I\nrecapitulates the arguments (well-known from the Meditations)\nfor the existence of God, mental substance, and other metaphysical\ntopics; whereas the remaining Parts proceed to explain the nature of\nmaterial substance, physics, cosmology, geology, and other branches of\nscience, supposedly based on these fundamental metaphysical truths.\nThis preoccupation with metaphysical foundations, and the causal\nexplanations of natural phenomena derived from them, might also\naccount for the absence in the Principles of Descartes\u2019\nmore mathematical work in physics, such as his discovery of the law of\nlight refraction. As he argued in the Rules for the Direction of\nthe Mind (1628), pure mathematicians are only concerned with\nfinding ratios and proportions, whereas natural philosophers are\nintent on understanding nature (AT X 393\u2013395). The development\nof modern physics, which is inextricably intertwined with modern\nmathematics, thus stands in sharp contrast to the latent Scholasticism\nevident in Descartes\u2019 metaphysical approach to physics.\n3. Space, Body, and Motion\n\nDescartes\u2019 many hypotheses concerning space and body are best\nappreciated when viewed as a continuation of a long debate within\nMedieval/Renaissance philosophy centered upon the Aristotelian dictum\nthat whatever possessed dimensionality was body (see, Grant 1981).\nWhile some philosophers, such as Telesio, Campanella, and Bruno, held\nspace to be always filled with matter (i.e., a plenum) yet somehow\nindependent of matter, others, like Patrizi and Gassendi, endorsed a\nmore absolutist notion that allowed spaces totally devoid of matter\n(i.e., vacuum). Rejecting these anti-Aristotelian ideas of empty\nspace, Descartes equated the defining property, or\n\u201cessence\u201d, of material substance with three-dimensional\nspatial extension: \u201cthe extension in length, breadth, and depth\nwhich constitutes the space occupied by a body, is exactly the same as\nthat which constitutes the body\u201d (Pr II 10). Consequently, there\ncannot exist a space separate from body (Pr II 16), since all spatial\nextension simply is body (and he rejects the possibility of a vacuum\nthat is not extended). If, for example, God removed the matter within\na vessel (such that nothing remained), then the sides of the vessel\nwould immediately become contiguous (but not through motion; Pr II\n18). It is important to note that Descartes\u2019 claim, that the\nvessel\u2019s sides must become contiguos, was a fairly common view\namong the Scholastics, since they also accepted the idea that spatial\nextension required a substance to ground extension (see, Grant 1981,\n122). Descartes argues that, with respect to the empty vessel, that\n\u201cnothingness cannot possess any extension\u201d, since\n\u201call distance is a mode of extension, and therefore cannot exist\nwithout an extended substance\u201d (Pr II 18). While Descartes\naccepts a substance-property metaphysics, the rejection of the empty\nvessel scenario seems more motivated by his nominalism, which is the\nview that only particulars exist, whereas universals are only names\nand abstractions from particluar things. As he states in an earlier\nsection of the Principles as regards numbers, \u201cwhen\nnumber is not being considered in any created things, but only in the\nabstract or in general, it is merely a mode of thought\u201d (Pr I\n58).\n\nDescartes\u2019 actual concept of \u201cspace\u201d can be regarded\nas a sort of conceptual abstraction from this bodily spatial\nextension, which he also dubs \u201cinternal place\u201d:\n\nWe attribute a generic unity to the extension of the space [of a\nbody], so that when the body which fills the space has been changed,\nthe extension of the space itself is not considered to have been\nchanged or transported but to remain one and the same; as long as it\nremains of the same size and shape and maintains the same situation\namong certain external bodies by means of which we specify that space.\n(Pr II 10F)\n\n\nRelative to an arbitrarily chosen set of bodies, it is thus possible\nto refer to the abstract (generic) spatial extension of a portion of\nthe plenum that different extended bodies successively\n\u201coccupy\u201d; and, presumably, by this process of abstraction\nthe internal place of the entire plenum can be likewise constructed.\nDescartes takes a similar view of time, which is judged to be a\ngeneralized abstraction from the \u201cdurations\u201d of particular\nbodies (where duration is an attribute of substance; Pr I\n55\u201357; see Gorham 2007 for more on time in Descartes). Also like\nthe Scholastics, Descartes rejects any form of atomism, which is the\nview that there exists a smallest indivisible particle of matter.\nRather, he holds that since any given spatially extended length is\ndivisible in thought, thus God has the power to actually divide it (Pr\nII 20). The material entities that interact in Descartes\u2019\nphysics come in distinct units or corpuscles (see\n Section 7),\n which explains the \u201ccorpuscularian\u201d title often\nattributed to his mechanical system, but these corpuscles are not\nindivisible.\n\nDescartes\u2019 Principles of Philosophy also presents his\nmost extensive discussion of the phenomena of motion, which is defined\nas \u201cthe transfer of one piece of matter or of one body, from the\nneighborhood of those bodies immediately contiguous to it and\nconsidered at rest, into the neighborhood of others\u201d (Pr II 25).\nDescartes attempts to distinguish his \u201cproper\u201d conception\nof motion, as a change of the \u201cneighborhood\u201d of contiguous\nbodies, from the common or \u201cvulgar\u201d conception of motion,\nwhich is change of internal place (Pr II 10\u201315, 24\u201328).\nThe surface of these containing bodies (that border the contained\nbody) is also called the \u201cexternal place\u201d of the contained\nbody. Descartes notes that the vulgar concept of motion allows a body\nto simultaneously take part in many (possibly contradictory) motions,\nas when a sitting passenger on a ship views himself as at rest\nrelative to the parts of the ship, but not at rest relative to the\nshore (Pr II 24). Yet, when motion is viewed as a translation of the\ncontiguous neighborhood, a body can only partake in one motion, which\ndispels the apparent contradiction (since the body must either be at\nrest, or in translation away from, its contiguous neighborhood).\n\nNevertheless, Descartes\u2019 hypothesis of motion may sanction a\nspecies of relative motion, since his phrase, \u201cconsidered at\nrest\u201d, implies that the choice of which bodies are at rest or in\nmotion is purely arbitrary. According to the \u201crelational\u201d\ntheory (or at least the more strict versions of relationism), space,\ntime, and motion are just relations among bodies, and not separately\nexisting entities or properties that are in any way independent of\nmaterial bodies. Motion only exists as a \u201crelative\ndifference\u201d among bodies: that is, the bodies do not possess\nindividual, determinate properties of speed, velocity, acceleration\n(e.g., body C has the speed property of \u201c5 miles per\nhour\u201d); rather, all that really exists is a difference in their\nrelative speed, velocity, and acceleration (e.g., there is a speed\ndifference among bodies C and B of \u201c5 miles\nper hour\u201d). Several passages in Descartes\u2019 analysis of\nmotion seem to support this strong variety of relationism: \u201cwe\ncannot conceive of the body AB being transported from the\nvicinity of the body CD without also understanding that the\nbody CD is transported from the vicinity of the body\nAB\u201d (Pr II 29). Hence, \u201call the real and positive\nproperties which are in moving bodies, and by virtue of which we say\nthey move, are also found in those [bodies] contiguous to them, even\nthough we consider the second group to be at rest\u201d (Pr II 30).\nThis form of relational motion has been dubbed the \u201creciprocity\nof transfer\u201d in the recent literature. Yet, as will be discussed\nin a later section, Descartes also holds that rest and motion are\ndifferent bodily states, a view that is incompatible with a strict\nrelationism as regards motion. Therefore, Cartesian reciprocity of\ntransfer only satisfies relationism (along with its ban on individual\nbodily states of motion) for moving bodies (i.e., when there is a\ntranslation manifest between a body and its contiguous neighborhood).\nMany of the difficulties associated with Cartesian physics can be\ntraced to the enormous ontological burden that Descartes places on his\nhypothesis of motion. In a later section we will examine the problem\nof integrating his account of motion with the Cartesian laws of\nnature, but a brief discussion of the apparent circularity of\nDescartes\u2019 definitions of motion and body is required at this\npoint. After describing motion as the transference of a body from the\nsurrounding neighborhood of bodies, Descartes states that by\n\u201cone body, or one part of matter, I here understand everything\nwhich is simultaneously transported\u201d (Pr II 25). The problem, of\ncourse, is that Descartes has defined motion as a change of contiguous\nbodies, and then proceeds to define body as that which moves\n(translates, transports). Although this circularity threatens the\nentire edifice of Cartesian physics, it is possible that Descartes\nintended both motion and body to possess an equal ontological\nimportance in his theory, such that neither is the more fundamental\nnotion (which serves as the basis for constructing or defining the\nother notion). Yet, their intrinsic interrelationship entails that any\nattempted definition of one must inevitably incorporate the other. The\nproblem with this reconstruction of Descartes\u2019 reasoning,\nhowever, is that Descartes explicitly deems motion to be a\n\u201cmode\u201d of extension; where a mode is a lesser ontological\ncategory that, roughly, can be understood as a way that extension\nmanifests itself, or as a \u201cproperty\u201d of extension (Pr I\n53; shape is also mentioned as a mode of extension). Finally, another\ndifficulty implicit in Descartes\u2019 theory is the fact that a\nresting body, according to the definition of body and place, would\nseem to \u201cblend\u201d into the surrounding plenum: that is, if a\nbody is \u201ceverything which is simultaneously transported\u201d,\nthen it is not possible to discern a resting body from the surrounding\nplenum matter that forms the external place of that resting body. In\naddition, Descartes rejects any explanation of the solidity of a body\nthat employs a bond among its particles (since the bond itself would\nbe either a substance or property, and thus the solidity of the bond\nwould presumably need to be explained; Pr II 55). A macroscopic\nmaterial body is, essentially, held together just by the relative rest\nof its constituent material parts. This raises the obvious difficulty\nthat the impact of such bodies should result in their dispersion or\ndestruction (for there is nothing to hold them together). These sorts\nof complications prompted many later natural philosophers, who were\ngenerally sympathetic to Descartes\u2019 mechanical philosophy, to\nsearch for an internal property of matter that could serve as a type\nof individuating and constitutive principle for bodies; e.g.,\nLeibniz\u2019 utilization of \u201cforce\u201d.\n\nRelated to the alleged circularity of the definitions of motion and\nbody, as well as the problem of resting bodies, is the difficulty in\nreconciling Descartes\u2019 definition of \u201csubstance\u201d\nwith his claim that individual bodies are substances. If, as Descartes\nbelieves, substances are not dependent on other things in order to\nexist (Pr I 51), then any part of extension (which is a body, via Pr\nII 10, as explained above) would not qualify as a substance since it\ndepend on its contiguous neighbors to delimit and define its boundary.\nYet, Descartes often declares that individual bodies are substances;\ne.g., \u201cthe two halves of a portion of matter, no matter how\nsmall they may be, are two complete substances\u201d (AT III 447).\nOne of the most popular replies to this difficulty, from Spinoza\n(Ethics, Part I, Prop. 15) to many contemporary commentators\n(e.g., Keeling 1968, Lennon 1993, Sowaal 2004, Schmaltz 2020, and\nnumerous others), is to declare that only the whole plenum is a\nsubstance, and not any of its constituent parts. The problem with this\nattempted solution, however, is that it lacks textual support, as is\nevident in the Pr I 51 quotation above. Likewise, some of these\nreconstructions, such as Lennon\u2019s, would seem to violate central\naspects of Cartesian physics and metaphysics, for he interprets motion\nas a phenomenal contribution of the mind, such that the plenum and its\nparts do not move or change at all. Along these same lines, some\nscholars (e.g., Schaffer 2009) have concluded that Descartes was a\nsupersubstantivalist, i.e., the view that space (spacetime, in the\nmodern setting) is the only predicable or fundamental substance. While\nDescartes\u2019 identification of corporeal substance and space (see\nabove, Pr II 10) might seem to support this reading,\nsupersubstantivalism takes space as primary, and matter as secondary\nor derived from space (see Sklar 1974, 222). Descartes, on the\ncontrary, takes matter or body as primary and space as a derived,\nabstract concept: \u201cthe same extension which constitutes the\nnature of body also constitutes the nature of space, and . . . these\ntwo things differ only in the way that the nature of the genus or\nspecies differs from that of the individual\u201d (Pr II 11). Whereas\nspace is a genus or species concept for Descartes (which is a\nuniversal; Pr I 59), space is the individual for the\nsupersubstantivalist, and thus ascribing supersubstantivalism to\nDescartes violates his nominalism (Pr II 8). Indeed, the reason that\nDescartes seeks to equate bodily and spatial extension in this part of\nthe Principles is that he strives to reject any view that\ntreats space as a separate, usually incorporeal, entity that is\nindependent of matter (e.g., the popular imaginary space tradition,\nwhich was a forerunner to the absolutist or substantivalist\nconception): \u201cThat corporeal substance, when distinguished from\nits quantity or extension, is confusedly conceived as if it were\nincorporeal\u201d (Pr II 9).\n4. The Laws of Motion and the Cartesian Conservation Principle\n\nForemost among the achievements of Descartes\u2019 physics are the\nthree laws of nature (which, essentially, are laws of bodily motion).\nNewton\u2019s own laws of motion would be modeled on this Cartesian\nbreakthrough, as is readily apparent in Descartes\u2019 first two\nlaws of nature: the first states \u201cthat each thing, as far as is\nin its power, always remains in the same state; and that consequently,\nwhen it is once moved, it always continues to move\u201d (Pr II 37),\nwhile the second holds that \u201call movement is, of itself, along\nstraight lines\u201d (Pr II 39; these two would later be incorporated\ninto Newton\u2019s first law of motion). By declaring that motion and\nrest are primitive states of material bodies without need of\nfurther explanation, and that bodies only change their state when\nacted upon by an external cause, it is not an exaggeration to claim\nthat Descartes helped to lay the foundation for the modern theory of\ndynamics (which studies the motion of bodies under the action of\nforces). For the Aristotelian-influenced Scholastics who had\nendeavored to ascertain the causal principles responsible for the\n\u201cviolent\u201d motions of terrestrial bodies (as opposed to\ntheir \u201cnatural\u201d motions to specific regions of the\nplenum), the explanation for these forced, unnatural motions seemed to\nlie in some type of internal bodily property, or external agent, that\nwas temporarily possessed by, or applied to, a body\u2014an\nexplanation that accounts for the fact that the body\u2019s motion\nboth originates and concludes in a state of rest (since, while on the\nearth\u2019s surface, the terrestrial element has no natural\nmotions). According to the medieval \u201cimpetus\u201d theory, for\nexample, these violent motions occur when a quality is directly\ntransferred to a body from a moving or constrained source, say, from a\nstretched bow to the waiting arrow. This property causes the observed\nbodily motion until such time that it is completely exhausted, thus\nbringing about a cessation of the violent movement (and the\narrow\u2019s fall back to earth). Implicit in the Scholastic view is\nthe basic belief that a terrestrial body continuously resists change\nfrom a state of rest while situated upon the earth, since the\ndepletion of the impetus property eventually effects a corresponding\nreturn of the body\u2019s original motionless, earthbound condition.\nDescartes, on the other hand, interpreted the phenomena of motion in\nan entirely new light, for he accepts the existence of inertial motion\n(uniform or non-accelerating motion) as a natural bodily state\nalongside, and on equal footing with, the notion of bodily rest. He\nargues, \u201cbecause experience seems to have proved it to us on\nmany occasions, we are still inclined to believe that all movements\ncease by virtue of their own nature, or that bodies have a tendency\ntowards rest. Yet this is assuredly in complete contradiction to the\nlaws of nature; for rest is the opposite of movement, and nothing\nmoves by virtue of its own nature towards its opposite or own\ndestruction\u201d (Pr II 37). While one can find several natural\nphilosophers whose earlier or contemporary work strongly foreshadowed\nDescartes\u2019 achievement in the first and second\nlaws\u2014namely, Galileo and Isaac Beeckman (see Arthur\n2007)\u2014the precise formulation put forward in the Principles\nof Philosophy is quite unique (especially as regards the second\nlaw, since both Galileo and Beeckman appear to sanction a form of\ncircular inertial motion, which possibly betrays the influence of the\nScholastic\u2019s circular motion of the celestial element). A\nfascinating blending of Scholasticism and the new physics is also\nevident in the above quotation, since Descartes invokes the logic of\ncontrary properties in his statement that \u201cnothing moves by\nvirtue of its own nature towards its opposite or own\ndestruction\u201d. That is, rest and motion are opposite or contrary\nstates, and since opposite states cannot (via the Scholastic\nprinciple) transform into one another, it follows that a body at rest\nwill remains at rest and a body in motion will remains in motion.\nConsequently, Descartes has employed a Scholastic/Medieval argument to\nground what is possibly the most important concept in the formation of\nmodern physics, namely inertia. Yet, it is important to note that\nDescartes\u2019 first and second laws do not correspond to the modern\nconcept of inertia, since he incorrectly regards (uniform,\nnon-accelerating) motion and rest as different bodily states, whereas\nmodern theory dictates that they are the same state.\n\nWhile Descartes\u2019 first and second laws deal with the rest and\nmotion of individual bodies, the third law of motion is expressly\ndesigned to reveal the properties exhibited among several bodies\nduring their collisions and interactions. In short, the third law\naddresses the behavior of bodies under the normal conditions in his\nmatter-filled world; when they collide: \u201cThe third law: that a\nbody, upon coming in contact with a stronger one, loses none of its\nmotion; but that, upon coming in contact with a weaker one, it loses\nas much as it transfers to that weaker body\u201d (Pr II 40). In the\nfollowing sections of the Principles, Descartes makes\nexplicit the conserved quantity mentioned in this third law:\n\nWe must however notice carefully at this time in what the force of\neach body to act against another or resist the action of that other\nconsists: namely, in the single fact that each thing strives, as far\nas in its power, to remain in the same state, in accordance with the\nfirst law stated above\u2026.This force must be measured not only by\nthe size of the body in which it is, and by the [area of the] surface\nwhich separates this body from those around it; but also by the speed\nand nature of its movement, and by the different ways in which bodies\ncome in contact with one another. (Pr II 43)\n\n\nAs a consequence of his first law of motion, Descartes insists that\nthe quantity conserved in collisions equals the combined sum of the\nproducts of size and speed of each impacting body. Although a\ndifficult concept, the \u201csize\u201d of a body roughly\ncorresponds to its volume, with surface area playing an indirect role\nas well. This conserved quantity, which Descartes refers to\nindiscriminately as \u201cmotion\u201d or \u201cquantity of\nmotion\u201d, is historically significant in that it marks one of the\nfirst attempts to locate an invariant or unchanging feature of bodily\ninteractions. To give an example, if a body B of size 3 and\nspeed 5 collides with a body C of size 2 and speed 4, then\nthe total quantity of motion of the system is 23, a quantity which\nremains preserved after the collision even though the bodies may\npossess different speeds.\n\nMoreover, Descartes envisions the conservation of quantity of motion\nas one of the fundamental governing principles of the entire cosmos.\nWhen God created the universe, he reasons, a certain finite amount of\nmotion (quantity of motion) was transmitted to its material occupants;\na quantity, moreover, that God continuously preserves at each\nsucceeding moment. (For more on the difficult issue of God\u2019s\ncontinuous recreation or preservation of the material world, see,\ne.g., Gorham 2004, Hattab 2007, and Schmaltz 2008).\n\nIt is obvious that when God first created the world, He not only moved\nits parts in various ways, but also simultaneously caused some of the\nparts to push others and to transfer their motion to these others. So\nin now maintaining the world by the same action and with the same laws\nwith which He created it, He conserves motion; not always contained in\nthe same parts of matter, but transferred from some parts to others\ndepending on the ways in which they come in contact. (Pr II 62)\n\n\nIn the Principles, Descartes conservation law only recognizes\na body\u2019s degree of motion, which correlates to the scalar\nquantity \u201cspeed\u201d, rather than the vectorial notion\n\u201cvelocity\u201d (which is speed in a given direction). This\ndistinction, between speed and velocity, surfaces in Descartes\u2019\nseven rules of impact, which spell out in precise detail the outcomes\nof bodily collisions (although these rules only describe the\ncollisions between two bodies traveling along the same straight line).\nDescartes\u2019 utilization of the concept of speed is manifest\nthroughout the rules. For example:\n\nFourth, if the body C were entirely at rest,\u2026and if\nC were slightly larger than B; the latter could\nnever have the force to move C, no matter how great the speed\nat which B might approach C. Rather, B\nwould be driven back by C in the opposite direction:\nbecause\u2026a body which is at rest puts up more resistance to high\nspeed than to low speed; and this increases in proportion to the\ndifferences in the speeds. Consequently, there would always be more\nforce in C to resist than in B to drive, \u2026.\n(Pr II 49F)\n\n\nAstonishingly, Descartes claims that a smaller body, regardless of its\nspeed, can never move a larger stationary body. While obviously\ncontradicting common experience, the fourth collision rule does nicely\ndemonstrate the scalar nature of speed, as well as the primary\nimportance of quantity of motion, in Cartesian dynamics. In this rule,\nDescartes faces the problem of preserving the total quantity of motion\nin situations distinguished by the larger body\u2019s complete rest,\nand thus zero value of quantity of motion. Descartes conserves the\njoint quantity of motion by equipping the stationary object C\nwith a resisting force sufficient to deflect the moving body\nB, a solution that does uphold the quantity of motion in\ncases where C is at rest. That is, since B merely\nchanges its direction of inertial motion, and not its size or degree\nof speed (and C equals zero throughout the interaction), the\ntotal quantity of motion of the system is preserved. For Descartes,\nreversing the direction of B\u2019s motion does not alter\nthe total quantity of motion, a conclusion that is in sharp contrast\nto the later hypothesis, usually associated with Newton and Leibniz,\nthat regards a change in direction as a negation of the initial speed\n(i.e., velocity). Thus, by failing to foresee the importance of\nconjoining direction and speed, Descartes\u2019 law falls just short\nof the modern law for the conservation of momentum.\n\nIn this context, the complex notion of \u201cdetermination\u201d\nshould be discussed, since it approximately corresponds to the\ncomposite direction of a body\u2019s quantity of motion. In some\npassages, Descartes apparently refers to the direction of a\nbody\u2019s motion as its determination: \u201cthere is a difference\nbetween motion considered in itself, and its determination in some\ndirection; this difference makes it possible for the determination to\nbe changed while the quantity of motion remains intact\u201d (Pr II\n41). Yet, a single motion does not have just one determination, as is\nclear in his critique of Hobbes\u2019 interpretation of\ndeterminations: \u201cWhat he [Hobbes] goes on to say, namely that a\n\u2018motion has only one determination,\u2019 is just like my\nsaying that an extended thing has only a single shape. Yet this does\nnot prevent the shape being divided into several components, just as\ncan be done with the determination of motion\u201d (April 21, 1641;\nAT III 356). In the same way that a particular shape can be\npartitioned into diverse component figures, so a particular\ndetermination can be decomposed into various constituent directions.\nIn his Optics, published in 1637, Descartes\u2019 derivation\nof his law of refraction seemingly endorses this interpretation of\ndeterminations. If a ball is propelled downwards from left to right at\na 45 degree angle, and then pierces a thin linen sheet, it will\ncontinue to move to the right after piercing the sheet but now at an\nangle nearly parallel with the horizon. Descartes reasons that this\nmodification of direction (from the 45 degree angle to a smaller\nangle) is the net result of a reduction in the ball\u2019s downward\ndetermination through collision with the sheet, \u201cwhile the one\n[determination] which was making the ball tend to the right must\nalways remain the same as it was, because the sheet offers no\nopposition at all to the determination in this direction\u201d (see\nFigure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Diagram from the\nOptics.\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 determination hypothesis also incorporates a certain\nquantitative element, as revealed in a further controversial\nhypothesis that is often described as the \u201cprinciple of least\nmodal action\u201d. In a letter to Clerselier (February 17th, 1645),\nDescartes explains:\n\nWhen two bodies collide, and they contain incompatible modes,\n[either different states of speed, or different determinations of\nmotion] then there must occur some change in these modes in order\nto make them compatible; but this change is always the least that may\noccur. In other words, if these modes can become compatible\nwhen a certain quantity of them is changed, then no larger quantity\nwill change (AT IV 185).\n\n\nThis principle can be illustrated with respect to our previous example\ninvolving the fourth collision rule. If both B and C\nwere to depart at the same speed and in the same direction after\nimpact, it would be necessary for the smaller body B to\ntransfer at least half of its quantity of motion to the larger\nstationary body C. Yet, Descartes reasons that it is easier\nfor B in this situation to merely reverse it direction than\nto transfer its motion:\n\nWhen C is the larger [body], B cannot push it in\nfront of itself unless it transfers to C more than half of\nits speed, together with more than half of its determination to travel\nfrom left to right in so far as this determination is linked with its\nspeed. Instead it rebounds without moving body C, and changes\nonly its whole determination, which is a smaller change than the one\nthat would come about from more than half of this determination\ntogether with more than half of its speed (AT IV 186).\n\n\nConsequently, reversing B\u2019s direction of motion, a\nchange of one mode (determination), constitutes a lesser modal change\nthan a transference of motion between two bodies, which alters two\nmodes (speed and determination). In this passage, it is important to\nnote that if B were to transfer motion to C, it\nwould change both half of B\u2019s speed and half of its\ndetermination, even though the direction of B\u2019s\nquantity of motion is preserved. As a result, a body\u2019s\ndetermination is apparently linked to its magnitude of speed.\n5. The Problem of Relational Motion\n\nAs discussed in previous sections, there are various ways in which\nDescartes\u2019 laws of motion violate a strict relationism. One of\nthe most problematic instances involves the relational compatibility\nof the fourth and fifth collision rules. Whereas the fourth rule\nconcludes that a large object remains at rest during impact with a\nsmaller moving body, such that the smaller body is deflected back\nalong its initial path, the fifth rule concludes that a large body\nwill move a smaller stationary object, \u201ctransferring to [the\nsmaller body] as much of its motion as would permit the two to travel\nsubsequently at the same speed\u201d (Pr II 50). From a relational\nstandpoint, however, rules four and five constitute the same type of\ncollision, since they both involve the interaction of a small and\nlarge body with the same relative motion (or speed difference) between\nthem. One might be tempted to appeal to the basic Cartesian tenet that\nmotion and rest are different intrinsic states of bodies, or the\nreciprocity of transfer thesis, to circumvent this difficulty (see\nsection 3): i.e., there is an ontological difference between a body\nthat is, or is not, undergoing a translation with respect to its\ncontiguous neighborhood, and this is sufficient to distinguish the\ncase of rule four from rule five (since the large body is really at\nrest in four, and really in motion in five).\n\nThe problem with this line of reasoning, however, is that it only\nworks if one presupposes that the two bodies are approaching one\nanother, and this is not a feature of the system that can be captured\nby sole reference to the contiguous neighborhood of each individual\nbody. Even if there is reciprocity of transfer between a body and its\nneighborhood, it is still not possible to determine which collision\nrule the impact will fall under, or if the bodies will even collide at\nall, unless some reference frame is referred to that can compute the\nmotion of both bodies relative to one another. Suppose, for instance,\nthat a certain spatial distance separates two bodies, and that one of\nthe bodies is, and the other is not, undergoing a translation relative\nto its neighboring bodies. Given this scenario, it is not possible to\ndetermine if; (i) the translating body is approaching the\nnon-translating body, or (ii) the spatial interval between them\nremains fixed and the translating body simply undergoes a change of\nneighborhood (i.e., the neighborhood moves relative to a stationary\nbody). In short, Descartes\u2019 reciprocity of transfer thesis\nunderdetermines the outcome of his bodily collisions, as well as the\ncapacity to apply, and make predictions from, the Cartesian collision\nrules. The context of the collision rules also supports the view that\nthe motions of the impacting bodies are determined from an external\nreference frame, rather than from the local translation of their\ncontiguous neighborhoods. In elucidating the fourth rule, for\ninstance, Descartes states that B could never move C\n\u201cno matter how great the speed at which B might\napproach C\u201d (Pr II 49)\u2014and only an external perspective,\nnot linked to the bodily reciprocity of transfer, could determine that\nB \u201capproaches\u201d C. Such admissions make\nit very difficult to reconcile Descartes\u2019 physics with a strict\nrelational theory of space and motion, although it may be compatible\nwith weaker forms of relationism that can countenance various external\nreference frames, structures, or other methods for determining the\nindividual states of bodily motion. These weaker relationist\nstrategies (or even non-relational, absolutist interpretations) of\nDescartes\u2019 physics come at a high price, however, since the\nreciprocity of transfer thesis must be abandoned. For these reasons,\nit is more likely that Descartes\u2019 reciprocity of transfer thesis\nis intended to counter any interpretation that regards motion as\ncaused by a bodily property, as some Scholastics had held (such as\nBuridan), rather then defend relational motion (see Maier 1982 on\nthese earlier views of motion). That is, if there is nothing in the\nmoving body that differs from its neighborhood of contiguous bodies\n(see Pr II 30), then a body\u2019s motion is not due to it possessing\na special property that its neighborhood lacks.\n6. \u201cForce\u201d in Cartesian Physics\n\nDespite the mechanistic, non-teleological character of\nDescartes\u2019 analysis of motion and bodily interactions, there are\nmany seemingly metaphysical and qualitative traits in Cartesian\nphysics that do not sit comfortably with his brand of reductionism\n(i.e., that material bodies are simply extension and its modes). In\nfact, returning to the Cartesian laws of nature (section 4), it is\nevident that Descartes has allotted a fundamental role to the action\nof bodily \u201cforces\u201d or \u201ctendencies\u201d: for\nexample, the tendency of bodies to follow straight lines, the\nresistance to motion of a large resting body (to a smaller moving\nbody), etc. In The World, he states: \u201cthe virtue or\npower in a body to move itself can well pass wholly or partially to\nanother body and thus no longer be in the first; but it cannot no\nlonger exist in the world\u201d (AT XI 15). As an early remark\nconcerning his conservation principle, this explanation seems to\nenvision force much like a property or \u201cpower\u201d possessed\nby individual material objects, similar to the qualitative,\nmetaphysical properties of the Scholastics (as in the\n\u201cimpetus\u201d theory). For these reasons, the nature of bodily\nforces or tendencies is a philosophical question of much interest in\nthe study of Descartes\u2019 physics.\n\nIn order to better grasp the specific role of Cartesian force, it\nwould be useful to closely examine his theory of centrifugal effects,\nwhich is closely associated with the second law of nature. Besides\nstraight-line motion, Descartes\u2019 second law also mentions the\n\u201ccenter-fleeing\u201d (centrifugal) tendencies of circularly\nmoving material bodies: \u201call movement is, of itself, along\nstraight lines; and consequently, bodies which are moving in a circle\nalways tends to move away from the center of the circle which they are\ndescribing\u201d (Pr II 39). At first glance, the second law might\nseem to correspond to the modern scientific dissection of centrifugal\nforce: specifically, the centrifugal effects experienced by a body\nmoving in a circular path, such as a stone in a sling, are a normal\nconsequence of the body\u2019s tendency to depart the circle along a\nstraight tangential path. Yet, as stated in his second law, Descartes\ncontends (wrongly) that the body tends to follow a straight line away\nfrom the center of its circular trajectory. That is, the force exerted\nby the rotating stone, as manifest in the outward \u201cpull\u201d\non the impeding sling, is a result of a striving towards straight line\ninertial motion directed radially outward from the center of the\ncircle, rather than a striving towards straight line motion aimed\nalong the circle\u2019s tangent. Descartes does acknowledge, however,\nthe significance of tangential motion in explicating such\n\u201ccenter-fleeing\u201d tendencies, but he relegates this\nphenomenon to the subordinate status of a composite effect. By his\nreckoning, the tendency to follow a tangential path exhibited by a\ncircling body, such as the flight of the stone upon release from the\nsling, can be constructed from two more basic or primary inclinations:\nfirst, the tendency of the object to continue along its circular path;\nand second, the tendency of the object to travel along the radial line\naway from the center. Thus, Descartes is willing to admit that\n\u201cthere can be strivings toward diverse movements in the same\nbody at the same time\u201d (Pr III 57), a judgment that seems to\npresuppose the acceptance of some type of \u201ccompositional\u201d\ntheory of tendencies analogous to his dissection of determinations.\nYet, since he believes that \u201cthe sling, \u2026, does not\nimpede the striving [of the body along the circular path]\u201d (Pr\nIII 57), he eventually places sole responsibility for the production\nof the centrifugal force effects on the radially directed component of\n\u201cstriving\u201d. He states, \u201cIf instead of considering\nall the forces of [a body\u2019s] motion, we pay attention, to only\none part of it, the effect of which is hindered by the\nsling;\u2026;we shall say that the stone, when at point A,\nstrives only [to move] toward D, or that it only attempts to\nrecede from the center E along the straight line\nEAD\u201d (Pr III 57; see Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Diagram that accompanies Pr\nIII 57.\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 use of the terms \u201ctendency\u201d and\n\u201cstriving\u201d in his rotating sling example should not be\nequated with his previous concept of a determination of motion. A\ndetermination is confined to a body\u2019s actual motion, whereas a\nbody\u2019s tendency towards motion only occurs at a single instant.\nHe states: \u201cOf course, no movement is accomplished in an\ninstant; yet it is obvious that every moving body, at any given moment\nin the course of its movement, is inclined to continue that movement\nin some direction in a straight line,\u2026\u201d (Pr II 39). In\nanother passage in the Principles, Descartes identifies these\nstrivings as a \u201cfirst preparation for motion\u201d (Pr III 63).\nHence, while determinations necessitate a span of several instants,\ntendencies towards motion are manifest only at single instants. This\nis a crucial distinction, for it partitions Cartesian dynamics into\ntwo ontological camps: forces that exist at moments of time, and\nmotions that can only subsist over the course of several temporal\nmoments. In many parts of the Principles, moreover, Descartes\nsuggests that quantity of motion is the measure of these bodily\ntendencies, and thus quantity of motion has a dual role as the measure\nof non-instantaneous bodily motion as well as the instantaneous bodily\ntendencies (see Pr III 121).\n\nGiven his rejection of the Scholastic qualitative tradition in\nphysics, Descartes\u2019 depiction of centrifugal effects as due to a\n\u201ctendency\u201d or \u201cstriving\u201d of moving bodies thus\nraises a host of intriguing ontological questions (and may even reveal\na vestigial influence of his earlier Scholastic training). That is,\neven as his penchant for a geometrical world view increased, as\nmanifest in the identification of extension as matter\u2019s primary\nquality, Descartes continued to treat inertial motion and its\naccompanying force effects as if they were essential characteristics\nof bodies. Descartes\u2019 own remarks on the ontological status of\ninertial force, furthermore, disclose a certain degree of ambiguity\nand indecision. In a 1638 letter, (six years before the\nPrinciples), he concludes:\n\nI do not recognize any inertia or natural sluggishness in\nbodies\u2026; and I think that by simply walking, a man makes the\nentire mass of the earth move ever so slightly, since he is putting\nhis weight now on one spot, now on another. All the same, I agree\n\u2026that when the largest bodies (such as the largest ships) are\npushed by a given force (such as a wind), they always move more slowly\nthan others. (AT II 467)\n\n\nIn this passage, Descartes seems to deny the existence of inertial\nforce if conceived as a form of Scholastic quality that material\nbodies can possess; rather, bodies are \u201cindifferent to\nmotion\u201d, so even the slightest weight should move the entire\nearth. On the other hand, he is willing to acknowledge the commonly\nobserved fact that larger objects are much harder to set in motion\nthan smaller objects. Consequently, although Descartes finds the\nexistence of \u201cforces of resistance\u201d (or \u201cnatural\nsluggishness\u201d) problematic, as is the case with such similar\nproperties as weight, he does not entirely relegate inertia to the\nphenomenological status of the so-called secondary properties of\nmatter (such as color, taste, etc., which only exist in the mind). The\nmain reason for this inclusion of inertial force effects into\nscientific discourse can probably be traced to Descartes\u2019\nclassification of motion as an intrinsic characteristic or\n\u201cmode\u201d of extension (see\n Section 3).\n As the concluding sections of the Principles state: \u201cI\nhave now demonstrated [there] are nothing in the [material] objects\nother than\u2026certain dispositions of size, figure and\nmotion\u2026\u201d (Pr IV 200). Since inertial forces are a\nconsequence or a by-product of motion, as the product of the size\ntimes speed of bodies, Descartes apparently did not object to\nincorporating these phenomena within the discussion of the modes of\nmaterial substance.\n\nYet, even if Descartes described force as an intrinsic fact of\nmaterial interactions, the exact nature of the relationship between\nforce and matter remains rather unclear. In particular, is force a\nproperty actually contained or present within bodies? Or, is it some\nsort of derivative phenomenal effect of the action of speed and size,\nand thus not present within extension? On the former interpretation\n(as favored by Alan Gabbey 1980, and Martial Gueroult 1980), forces\nexist in bodies in at least one important sense as \u201creal\u201d\nproperties or modes whose presence occasions the Cartesian laws of\nnature. While many of Descartes\u2019 explanations might seem to\nfavor this interpretation (e.g., \u201c[a body] at rest has force to\nremain at rest\u201d, Pr II 43), Daniel Garber charges that such\nviews run counter to Descartes\u2019 demand that extension alone\ncomprise the essence of matter. Garber suggests that we view Cartesian\nforce as a sort of shorthand description of the dynamical regularities\nmaintained in the world by God, and not as some form of quality\ninternal to bodies: \u201cThe forces that enter into the discussion\n[of the Cartesian collision laws] can be regarded simply as ways of\ntalking about how God acts, resulting in the law-like behavior of\nbodies; force for proceeding and force of resisting are ways of\ntalking about how, \u2026, God balances the persistence of the state\nof one body with that of another\u201d (Garber 1992a, 298; see also\nHatfield 1979, Des Chene 1996, and Manchak 2009, for more approaches).\nIn various passages associated with the conservation principle,\nGarber\u2019s interpretation apparently gains credibility. For\ninstance: \u201cSo in now maintaining the world by the same action\nand with the same laws with which He [God] created it, He conserves\nmotion; not always contained in the same parts of matter, but\ntransferred from some parts to others depending on the ways in which\nthey come in contact\u201d (Pr II 42). In retrospect, however, it\nmust be acknowledged that Descartes\u2019 classification of material\nsubstance with extension, as exemplified in his demand that there\nexists nothing in bodies except \u201ccertain dispositions of size,\nfigure and motion\u201d, is so open-ended and equivocal as to easily\naccommodate both of the interpretations surveyed above. All that can\nbe safely concluded is that Descartes envisioned the forces linked\nwith bodily inertial states as basic, possibly primitive, facts of the\nexistence of material bodies\u2014a broad judgment that, by refusing\nto take sides, opts out of this difficult ontological dispute.\n7. Cartesian Cosmology and Astrophysics\n\nDescartes\u2019 vortex theory of planetary motion proved initially to\nbe one of the most influential aspects of Cartesian physics, at least\nuntil roughly the mid-eighteenth century. A vortex, for Descartes, is\na large circling band of material particles. In essence,\nDescartes\u2019 vortex theory attempts to explain celestial\nphenomena, especially the orbits of the planets or the motions of\ncomets, by situating them (usually at rest) in these large circling\nbands. The entire Cartesian plenum, consequently, is comprised of a\nnetwork or series of separate, interlocking vortices. In our solar\nsystem, for example, the matter within the vortex has formed itself\ninto a set of stratified bands, each lodging a planet, that circle the\nsun at varying speeds. The minute material particles that form the\nvortex bands consist of either the atom-sized, globules (secondary\nmatter) or the \u201cindefinitely\u201d small debris (primary\nmatter) left over from the impact and fracture of the larger elements;\ntertiary matter, in contrast, comprises the large, macroscopic\nmaterial element (Pr III 48\u201354). This three-part division of\nmatter, along with the three laws of nature, are responsible for all\ncosmological phenomena in Descartes\u2019 system, including gravity.\nAs described in Pr III 140, a planet or comet comes to rest in a\nvortex band when its radially-directed, outward tendency to flee the\ncenter of rotation (i.e., centrifugal force; see\n Section 6)\n is balanced by an equal tendency in the minute elements that comprise\nthe vortex ring. If the planet has either a greater or lesser\ncentrifugal tendency than the small elements in a particular vortex,\nthen it will, respectively, either ascend to the next highest vortex\n(and possibly reach equilibrium with the particles in that band) or be\npushed down to the next lowest vortex\u2014and this latter scenario\nultimately supplies Descartes\u2019 explanation of the phenomenon of\ngravity, or \u201cheaviness\u201d. More specifically, Descartes\nholds that the minute particles that surround the earth account for\nterrestrial gravity in this same manner (Pr IV 21\u201327). As for\nthe creation of the vortex system, Descartes reasons that the\nconserved quantity of motion imparted to the plenum eventually\nresulted in the present vortex configuration (Pr III 46). God first\npartitioned the plenum into equal-sized portions, and then placed\nthese bodies into various circular motions that, ultimately, formed\nthe three elements of matter and the vortex systems (see Figure\n3).\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Plenum vortices in the\nPrinciples, Pr III 53.\n\n\nBesides the ontological economy of only requiring inertial motion and\nits attendant force effects, Descartes\u2019 choice of circularly\nmoving bands of particles may have also been motivated by worries\nover, for lack of a better term, \u201cplenum crowding\u201d. In the\nPrinciples, he argues: \u201cIt has been shown\u2026that\nall places are full of bodies\u2026. From this it follows that no\nbody can move except in a complete circle of matter or ring of bodies\nwhich all move at the same time\u201d (Pr II 33). Circular motion is\ntherefore necessary for Descartes because there are no empty spaces\nfor a moving object to occupy. Although the world is described as\n\u201cindefinitely\u201d large (Pr I 26\u201327, with only God\nreceiving the more positive description, infinite), the non-circular\nmotion of a single body could violate the Cartesian conservation\nprinciple by resulting in an indeterminate material displacement. As\nan aside, it is enormously difficult to reconcile Descartes\u2019\ncollision rules with his claim that all bodily motion occurs in\ncircular paths; moreover, since the bodies that comprise the circular\npath all move simultaneously, it seems to follow from the definition\nof \u201cbody\u201d (see\n Section 3)\n that there is only one moving body (and not many).\n\nReturning to the vortex theory, Descartes allots a considerable\nportion of the Principles to explicating various celestial\nphenomena, all the while adopting and adapting numerous sub-hypotheses\nthat apply his overall mechanical system to specific celestial events.\nOne of the more famous of these explanations is the Cartesian theory\nof vortex collapse, which also provides an hypothesis on the origins\nof comets (Pr III 115\u2013120). Briefly, Descartes reckons that a\nsignificant amount of first element matter constantly flows between\nadjacent vortices: as the matter travels out of the equator of one\nvortex, it passes into the poles of its neighbor. Under normal\nconditions, primary matter flows from the poles of a vortex into its\ncenter, i.e., the sun, which is itself comprised of primary matter.\nDue to centrifugal force, these particles press out against the\nsurrounding secondary globules as they begin their advance towards the\nequator (Pr III 120\u2013121); the pressure exerted by the primary\nand secondary elements (on a person\u2019s optic nerve) also serving\nas the cause of light (Pr III 55\u201364, IV 195). Since the adjacent\nvortices also possess the same tendency to swell in size, a balance of\nexpansion forces prevents the encroachment of neighboring vortices. On\noccasion, however, a buildup of larger elements on the sun\u2019s\nsurface, identified as sunspots, may conspire to prevent the incoming\nflow of first element matter from the poles. If the sunspots\nultimately cover the entire surface of the sun, the vortex\u2019s\nremaining primary matter will be expelled at the equator, and thus it\nno longer has a source of outward pressure to prevent the encroachment\nof neighboring vortices. Once the vortex is engulfed by its expanding\nneighbors, the encrusted sun may become either a planet in a new\nvortex, or end up as a comet passing through many vortices.\n\nOn the whole, the vortex theory offered the natural philosopher a\nhighly intuitive model of celestial phenomena that was compatible with\nthe mechanical philosophy. The theory was regarded as superior to\nNewton\u2019s theory of universal gravitation since it did not posit\na mysterious, occult quality (gravity) as the cause of the planetary\norbits or the free-fall of terrestrial objects. The vortex theory\nlikewise provided a built-in explanation for the common direction of\nall planetary orbits. Additionally, the vortex theory allowed\nDescartes to endorse a form of Copernicanism (i.e., sun-centered\nworld) without running afoul of Church censorship. Since the alleged\nmotion of the earth was one of the Church\u2019s principal objections\nto Galileo\u2019s science, Descartes hoped to avoid this objection by\nplacing the earth at rest within a vortex band that circled the sun,\nsuch that the earth does not undergo a change of place relative to the\ncontaining surface of the neighboring material particles in its vortex\nband (Pr III 24\u201331; and section 3). Through this ingenious\nmaneuver, Descartes could then claim that the earth does not\nmove\u2014via his definition of place and motion\u2014and yet\nmaintain the Copernican hypothesis that the earth orbits the sun.\n\u201cThe Earth, properly speaking, is not moved, nor are any of the\nPlanets; although they are carried along by the heaven\u201d (Pr III\n28). In the long run, however, Descartes\u2019 vortex theory failed\nfor two fundamental reasons: first, neither Descartes nor his\nfollowers ever developed a systematic mathematical treatment of the\nvortex theory that could match the accuracy and predictive scope of\nthe (continuously improving) Newtonian theory; and second, many\nattempts by Cartesian natural philosophers to test Descartes\u2019\nvarious ideas on the dynamics of circularly moving particles (e.g., by\nusing large spinning barrels filled with small particles) did not meet\nthe predictions advanced in the Principles (see Aiton\n1972).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aiton, E.
