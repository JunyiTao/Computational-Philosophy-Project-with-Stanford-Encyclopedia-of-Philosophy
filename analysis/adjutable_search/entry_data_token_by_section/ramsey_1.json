    "main_text": "The Foundations of Logic and Mathematics\n2. The Foundations of Logic and Mathematics\n\nRamsey, as we saw in the previous section, was still an undergraduate\nwhen, aged 19, he completed a translation of the Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus (Wittgenstein 1922). Alas, C. K. Ogden\ngot all the credit and it has been known since as the \u2018Ogden\ntranslation\u2019. Ramsey\u2019s translation is usually considered\nto be superseded by the Pears-McGuinness translation (1961), but one\nshould not lose sight of the fact that it was carefully scrutinized by\nWittgenstein, who gave it his seal of approval. Ramsey then wrote a\nsearching review of the Tractatus (1923) in which he raised\nmany serious objections (Methven 2015, chapter 4) (Sullivan 2005). One\nsuch objections is the \u2018colour-exclusion problem\u2019 (1923,\n473), against Wittgenstein\u2019s claim in 6.3751 that it is\n\u201clogically impossible\u201d that a point in the visual field be\nboth red and blue. This claim was linked to the requirement that\nelementary propositions be logically independent (otherwise, the\nanalysis of the proposition would not be completed), a pillar of the\nTractatus. Wittgenstein\u2019s recognition in 1929 that he\ncould not sustain his claim (Wittgenstein 1929), probably under\npressure at that stage from discussions with Ramsey, was to provoke\nthe downfall of the Tractatus.\n\nIn 1923 and 1924, Ramsey also visited Wittgenstein, who was teaching\nat Puchberg am Schneeberg (Lower Austria). During these visits,\nWittgenstein made changes to the text and translation, that were\nincorporated in later editions. (Details are given in (Lewy 1967).) At\nfirst under the spell, Ramsey became disillusioned. In 1923, he wrote\nhome that he would \u201ctry and pump him for ideas for\n[Principia Mathematica\u2019s] further development which I\nshall attempt\u201d (Wittgenstein [LO], 78), but in 1924 he remarked\nlaconically: \u201cHe is no good for my work\u201d (Sahlin 1997,\n64).\n\nRamsey\u2019s first major self-assigned task in the foundations of\nmathematics was indeed to revise Whitehead and Russell\u2019s\nPrincipia Mathematica, partly in the hope that his version\nwould meet some of Wittgenstein\u2019s criticisms of its axioms and\ntreatment of identity, but also because of some further defects he\ndiagnosed in its treatment of the paradoxes and in its inability\nproperly to account for the \u2018extensionality\u2019 of\nmathematics (1925a, [PP] 177\u2013178). For further details about the\ncontent of the following paragraph, see the entry for Principia\nMathematica.\n\nRamsey drew a distinction between \u2018logical\u2019 and\n\u2018semantical\u2019 paradoxes, with Russell\u2019s paradox\nbelonging to the former category and Richard\u2019s or\nGrelling\u2019s paradoxes to the latter (1925a, [PP] 183\u2013184).\nAccording to him, the heart of the problem was in the way the theory\nof types was devised to deal with the paradoxes, as understood in\nterms of the \u2018vicious-circle principle\u2019 (\u2018whatever\ninvolves all of a collection must not be one of the\ncollection\u2019):\n\n\nThese contradictions it was proposed to remove by what is called the\nTheory of Types, which consists really of two distinct parts directed\nrespectively against two groups of contradictions. These two parts\nwere unified by being both deduced in a rather sloppy way from the\n\u2018vicious-circle principle\u2019, but it seems to me essential\nto consider them separately. (1925a, [PP] 187)\n\n\nRamsey rightly saw that a \u2018simple\u2019 theory of types\n(sometimes called \u2018ramseyfied\u2019) that distinguishes types\nof propositional functions by their arguments would deal with\n\u2018logical\u2019 paradoxes, but in order to deal with the other\nparadoxes, Whitehead and Russell had introduced a\n\u2018branched\u2019 or \u2018ramified\u2019 theory of types with\na hierarchy of levels of functions (and of propositions), that led to\nfurther difficulties, one of which being the inability even to\nformulate theorems of classical mathematics such as the least upper\nbound theorem, unless one introduced the \u2018Axiom of\nReducibility\u2019 according to which for any function at any level\nthere exists an equivalent one at the first level (1925a, [PP]\n187\u2013192). (Another worry, that one could not formulate\nmathematical induction in its full generality turns out to have been\nunfounded.) Wittgenstein had pointed out in the Tractatus\nthat it is not a tautology (6.1233), so that it could hardly serve as\nan axiom. To circumvent this, Ramsey introduced his own notion of\n\u2018predicative function\u2019 and showed that if one gets rid of\nthe \u2018vicious-circle principle\u2019, the levels can be\ncollapsed and the need for the \u2018Axiom of Reducibility\u2019 is\nobviated (1925a, [PP] 195\u2013205). Thus, Ramsey had in effect shown\nhow to deal with the paradoxes and the \u2018extensionality\u2019 of\nmathematics without the need for a \u2018ramified\u2019 theory of\ntypes. (In this he was preceded by Leon Chwistek (Chwistek 1921).)\nThis, Ramsey concluded, would secure mathematics against the\n\u201cBolshevik menace\u201d of the intuitionist critique of Brouwer\nand Weyl (1925a, [PP] 219).\n\nRamsey also took seriously Wittgenstein\u2019s critique\n(5.53\u20135.533) of the definition of identity in Principia\nMathematica (\u221713.01) in terms of indiscernibility (with\nF a predicative function): \n\\[ x\\! =\\! y \\;=_{df}\\; \\forall F(Fx \\to Fy) \\]\n\n\nWittgenstein argued that to say that two things are the same,\nx = y, is nonsense, while x = x is\nempty and showed how to get rid of identity with an\n\u2018exclusive\u2019 reading of the variables (Hintikka 1956),\n(Wehmeier 2008), (Wehmeier 2012), with the exception of some\npropositions such as the axiom of infinity that cannot be so read, and\nare thus to be rejected (5.535). To save the latter (and the axiom of\nchoice, which was then called the \u2018Multiplicative Axiom\u2019),\nRamsey introduced \u2018functions in extension\u2019 (including\narbitrary pairings of arguments with values, and indicated here with\nthe subscript \\(e\\)), replacing the above with: \n\\[ \\forall \\phi_e (\\phi_{e}x \\equiv \\phi_{e} y)\\]\n\n\nHe then argued that this is a tautology if \\(x = y\\), and a\ncontradiction if \\(x \\neq y\\). This is the subject on which he\neventually sparred with Wittgenstein, when the latter wrote a letter\nin 1927 (reproduced in [NP] 340\u2013341). Wittgenstein argued that\neither way this formula is nonsensical and cannot be substituted for\nx = y. Two drafts of a rejoinder by Ramsey are\npreserved ([NP] 342\u2013346), but the matter was dropped\nsubsequently, although Wittgenstein came back to it repeatedly after\nRamsey\u2019s death, for example in (Wittgenstein [BT], \u00a7 113).\n(For further discussion see Marion 1995; Sullivan 1995; and Methven\n2015, chapter 7.)\n\nIt is said that, when Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in January\n1929, it was primarily to discuss philosophy with Ramsey, who he\nobviously deemed a worthy interlocutor, and they reportedly met on a\nregular basis, until Ramsey\u2019s death the following January. They\nboth left behind manuscripts which show that Ramsey had shifted his\nviews on a number of topics, while Wittgenstein\u2019s thought was\nalso set in motion towards his later views. In the preface to the\nPhilosophical Investigations, he wrote:\n\n\nFor since I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen\nyears ago, I could not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out\nin that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes \u2013 to\na degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate \u2013 by the\ncriticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I\ndiscussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years\nof his\n life.[1]\n (Wittgenstein 1953 [PI, 4])\n\n\nAlthough one can at least point out with McGuinness that\n\u201cWittgenstein clearly learnt a lot from Ramsey\u201d\n(McGuinness 2006, 25), if one asks who made the larger contribution in\nthese discussions, there is considerable disagreement, with claims\nranging from the idea that literally none of the later\nWittgenstein\u2019s key ideas can be traced to Ramsey (Kienzler 1997,\n75\u201376), to claims of various degrees of a more substantial\ninfluence by Ramsey on Wittgenstein (Glock 2005, Majer 1991; Marion\n1998, chapters 4\u20135; Marion 2012; Methven 2015, chapter 9; Misak\n2016a, chapter 7; Misak 2016b; Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990; Sahlin 1997).\nIt is perhaps better simply to talk of a confluence of ideas, and the\nfollowing, being restricted to Ramsey, will show that he reasoned\nalong lines largely independent from Wittgenstein, and began shifting\nhis views before 1929.\n\nThis confluence is particularly visible in texts relating to the\nfoundations of mathematics, where Ramsey became disillusioned with\nPrincipia Mathematica, perhaps under the influence of\nWittgenstein, whose criticisms of the axioms of infinity and\nreducibility, he had already taken seriously in \u2018The Foundations\nof Mathematics\u2019, as was just pointed out. Ramsey initially\nadopted Wittgenstein\u2019s view of the quantifiers in the\nTractatus as \u2018logical products\u2019 and\n\u2018sums\u2019, with universality being expressed, for predicate\nF, as an infinite conjunction \n\\[Fa \\: \\wedge\\: Fb \\:\\wedge\\: Fc \\:\\wedge\\: \\ldots \\]\n\n\nAnd existence as an infinite disjunction \n\\[Fa \\: \\lor\\: Fb \\:\\lor\\: Fc \\:\\lor\\: \\ldots \\]\n\n\n(1926c, [PP] 240; 1927a, [PP] 48\u201349). In absence of a rule of\ngeneralization, one has at most that a universality implies any of its\ninstances: \n\\[\\tag{1.1} \\forall x Fx \\to Fa \\]\n\n\nand the product becomes infinite, and without a rule of existential\nelimination all one has is that an instance implies existence:\n\n\\[\\tag{1.2} Fa \\to \\exists xFx \\]\n\n\nThe disjunction being infinite, it cannot sum up all the\ndisjuncts.\n\nWittgenstein had hinted in the Tractatus at a logic-free\nequational calculus for arithmetic (6.02\u20136.031 & 6.241), but\nRamsey thought this to be a \u201cridiculously narrow view of\nmathematics\u201d (1925a, [PP] 180), and wanted the convenience\nafforded by quantifiers. He assessed two alternatives to Wittgenstein,\nThoralf Skolem\u2019s proposal simply to do away with the\nquantifiers, in a paper where he introduced primitive recursive\narithmetic (Skolem 1923 [1967]) and Hermann Weyl\u2019s suggestion in\n\u2018\u00dcber die neue Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik\u2019 (Weyl\n1921 [1998]) \u2013 the very paper in which he joined Brouwer in his\ncritique of classical mathematics, \u2013 that universality should be\nunderstood in analogy with bank drafts, as \u2018instructions for\njudgements\u2019, while existence would be a \u2018judgment\nabstract\u2019, classical existence being compared to a treasure map\nthat does not tell us where to find the treasure (Weyl 1921 [1998],\n97\u201398). These explanations happen to justify (1.1) and (1.2)\nabove. Weyl claimed further that (1.1) and (1.2) cannot be negated\nsince one could not, say, survey infinitely many disjuncts, so the law\nof excluded middle would not hold.\n\nIn two of his last papers, \u2018Principles of Finitist\nMathematics\u2019 and \u2018The Formal Structure of Intuitionist\nMathematics\u2019 ([NP] 197\u2013200), Ramsey sided with Weyl. It\nappears that he wanted to obtain arithmetic by adding quantifiers,\nwith Weyl\u2019s rules, to Skolem\u2019s primitive recursive\narithmetic. But he did not provide a rule of existential elimination\nand rules that he proposed in these papers appear to restrict formulas\nwith quantifiers to those that can be converted to prenex normal form\n(with quantifiers prefixed on the left, followed with a\nquantifier-free matrix). In intuitionism, the law of the excluded\nmiddle applies to atomic formulas and, if quantifiers are in prenex\nnormal form, the theory remains constructive. This is what Ramsey\ncaptured, but the result is not the full intuitionistic arithmetic, as\nnot all intuitionistic formulas are equivalent to prenex formulas. In\n\u2018Principles of Finitist Mathematics\u2019, he stated that his\nrules provide \u201call the logical modes allowed by the\nfinitists\u201d ([NP] 201), but if he meant\n\u2018intuitionism\u2019, the claim was inaccurate.\n\nRamsey already discussed Weyl earlier, for example in\n\u2018Mathematical Logic\u2019 (1926c, [PP] 230 & 233), without\napproving him, so one needs to explain why he changed his mind in\n1928\u201329. This may be the result of changes in his underlying\nconception of theories from his 1928 manuscript On Truth\n([OT] 33\u201334) to \u2018Theories\u2019 (1929). According to his\nlater view, a \u2018primary system\u2019 of true or false\nobservational statements is entailed, via a\n\u2018dictionary\u2019, by a \u2018secondary system\u2019 of\nhypotheses (1929a, [PP] 112\u2013115). This is a view that has roots\nin both the introduction to Heinrich Hertz\u2019s The Principles\nof Mechanics (Hertz 1899) and in chapter VI of Norman\nCampbell\u2019s Physics. The Elements (Campbell 1920), but\nRamsey described, as we shall see, hypotheses not as statements or\npropositions, but, adapting Weyl\u2019s expression, as \u2018rules\nfor judging\u2019.\n\nAt a deeper level, Ramsey\u2019s change of mind can be traced back to\nhis having read C. S. Peirce\u2019s Chance, Love and Logic\n(Peirce 1923). In \u2018Fact and Propositions\u2019 (1925) he had\nalready written: \u201cThe essence of pragmatism I take to be this,\nthat the meaning of a sentence is to be defined by reference to the\nactions to which asserting it would lead, or, more vaguely still, by\nits possible causes and effects\u201d (1927a, [PP] 51). This forms\npart of what Nils-Eric Sahlin called \u2018British Pragmatism\u2019\n(Sahlin 1997, 65; Marion 2012), and Cheryl Misak \u2018Cambridge\nPragmatism\u2019 (Misak 2016). This causal theory allowed him to tie\nlogical form with causal properties, for example when he argued that\ndisbelieving p and believing its negation \u00ac p\nhave the same causal properties (1927a, [PP] 44). (There is a link\nworth noticing here with his view on \u2018Universals\u2019 (1925),\nsince this suggestion allows him to avoid \u2018negative\nfacts\u2019.) Ramsey suggested at that stage that a causal theory of\nthis sort could accommodate the quantifiers as understood (as above)\nby Wittgenstein: \u201cFeeling belief towards \u2018For all \\(x\\),\n\\(fx\\)\u2019 has certain causal properties which we call its\nexpressing agreement only with the possibility that all the values of\n\\(fx\\) are true\u201d (1927a, [PP] 49). By 1928\u20131929, however,\nhis pragmatism finally led him to abandon this suggestion.\n\nIn his review of the Tractatus, Ramsey thought that\nWittgenstein\u2019s suggestion for eliminating the subject (5.542)\nwas \u201can important advance\u201d (1923, 469), but he assumed the\nopposite in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 (1928). In a passage\nwhere he admitted following Peirce (1926a, [PP] 90 n. 2), he argued\nthat the human mind \u201cworks essentially according to general\nrules or habits\u201d (1926a, [PP] 90):\n\n\nThe mind works by general laws; therefore if it infers \\(q\\) from\n\\(p\\), this will generally be because \\(q\\) is an instance of a\nfunction \\(\\phi x\\) and \\(p\\) the corresponding instance of a function\n\\(\\psi x\\) such that the mind would always infer \\(\\phi x\\) from\n\\(\\psi x\\). (1926a, [PP] 91)\n\n\nAnd, again in pragmatist manner, he argued that one judges habits in\nterms of their success: \u201cgiven a habit of a certain form, we can\npraise or blame it accordingly as the degree of belief it produces is\nnear or far from the actual proportion in which the habit leads to\ntruth\u201d (1926a, [PP] 92).\n\nIn \u2018General Propositions and Causality\u2019 (1929), Ramsey\nfollowed this with Peirce\u2019s idea that beliefs \u201cguide our\nactions\u201d (Peirce 1992, 114), describing a belief as a \u201cmap\nby which we steer\u201d (1929b, [PP] 146). It is for this very reason\nthat he could not countenance the belief qua map being\ninfinite: \u201cif we professedly extend it to infinity, it is no\nlonger a map; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over\nbefore we need its remoter parts\u201d (1929b, [PP] 146). He then\nintroduced the notion of \u2018variable hypotheticals\u2019 as\nforming the \u201csystem with which the speaker meets the\nfuture\u201d and described them in terms strongly reminiscent of\nWeyl:\n\n\nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n\u2018If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a \\(\\psi\\)\u2019.\nThis cannot be negated but it can be disagreed with\nby one who does not adopt it. (1929b, [PP] 149)\n\n\u2026 when we assert a causal law we are asserting not a fact, not\nan infinite conjunction, nor a connection of universals, but a\nvariable hypothetical which is not strictly a proposition at all, but\na formula from which we derive propositions. (1929b, [PP], 159)\n\n\nThere is indeed a definite connection here with his growing qualms, of\na \u2018finitist\u2019 nature, about the axiom of infinity:\n\u201cSo too there may be an infinite totality, but what seems to be\npropositions about it are again variable hypotheticals and\n\u2018infinite collection\u2019 is really nonsense\u201d (1929b,\n[PP] 160).\n\nRamsey\u2019s last papers thus show that he was moving towards an\noriginal synthesis of Weyl\u2019s intuitionism (or finitism) with\npragmatism (Majer 1989; Majer 1991; Marion 2012; Misak 2016a (chapter\n6); Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990, chapter 4). As for the confluence of\nideas, it is possible that Wittgenstein\u2019s notion of\n\u2018hypothesis\u2019 had other sources (Marion 2008), but he also\ncame to reject his own view of the quantifiers in the\nTractatus (for example in his Cambridge lectures\n(Wittgenstein [LC], 217 & 219)), and his own language bore strong\nresemblance to that of Weyl and Ramsey when he spoke of a hypothesis\nas a \u201claw for forming expectations\u201d (Wittgenstein [PR],\n\u00a7228).\n",
