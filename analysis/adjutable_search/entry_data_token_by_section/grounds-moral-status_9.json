These capacities\nmight be intellectual or emotional. Historically, the most famous\nsophisticated intellectual capacities account was given by Kant,\naccording to whom autonomy, the capacity to set ends via practical\nreasoning, must be respected (see the entry on\n respect)\n and grounds the dignity of all rational beings ([GMM], pp. 434, 436,\nPrussian Academy pagination). Beings without autonomy may be treated\nas a mere means (p. 428). For a contemporary version, see Quinn (1984,\npp. 49\u201352) who claims that the capacity to will (his term for\nautonomy) is sufficient for rights of respect. Other intellectual\ncapacities that have been suggested, even if not always embraced, as\ngrounding what we call FMS include the following: the capacity for\nself-awareness (McMahan 2002, pp. 45 and 242) or awareness of oneself\nas a continuing subject of mental states (Tooley 1972, p. 44); being\nfuture-oriented in one\u2019s desires and plans (one could draw on\nSinger 1993, pp. 95 and 100, though insofar as his own view is\nutilitarian it does not fall into section 5.1); capacity to value, or,\nmore specifically, \u201cto appreciate the value of valuable\nthings\u201d (Buss 2012, p. 352); \u201cbeing good for ourselves in\nvirtue of the capacity to value\u201d (Theunissen 2020, pp.\n126\u2013127); capacity to bargain, and to assume duties and\nresponsibilities (all part of a longer list in Feinberg 1980, p. 197).\nOn the emotional side, one sophisticated capacity that has been\nproposed is the capacity to care, as distinguished from the mere\ncapacity to desire. (Jaworska (2007) posits this as sufficient but\nperhaps not necessary for FMS.) There are also combination views that\nappeal to both intellectual and emotional sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities as necessary and sufficient for FMS (Feinberg 1980, p.\n197).\n\nAccording to Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities accounts, the feature\ngrounding FMS is not relational: the source of moral status is neither\na relation the individual stands in (e.g., membership in a species)\nnor a capacity whose exercise requires active participation of another\n(e.g., the capacity to relate to others in certain mutually responsive\nways). In some versions, the exercise of the relevant capacities does\nnot even require the existence of anyone else, while in others (as in\nthe case of caring about someone) it, at most, involves the presence\nof another being but not necessarily that being\u2019s active\nparticipation. Individuals have FMS solely because they can engage in\ncertain cognitively sophisticated acts or responses on their own.\n\nA being of any type that has these sophisticated cognitive capacities\nhas FMS, and so the accounts avoid anthropocentrism. However, since\nmost (but not necessarily all) animals lack sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities, they are not accorded the same moral status as an\nunimpaired adult human. Similarly, in the case of a living organism\nsuch as a redwood tree or a fetus, as well as non-individual entities,\nsuch as species and ecosystems, they would not have FMS on these\nviews.\n\nSome of these views (e.g., Kant\u2019s) do not allow for any moral\nstatus other than FMS, and so would hold that beings who don\u2019t\nmeet the threshold for FMS have no moral status at all. Other views\nare silent on this question and compatible with lower degrees of moral\nstatus for beings or entities that are not cognitively sophisticated.\nYet others (e.g., McMahan 2002) explicitly insist that all sentient\nbeings have some degree of moral status.\n\nA stock objection to Sophisticated Cognitive Capacities accounts is\ntheir underinclusiveness. Not only will some environmentalists and\nanimal activists find the view underinclusive, but so too will those\nwho subscribe to the \u201ccommonsense view\u201d articulated in\nsection 1. For example, infants lack sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities, and so fail to meet this necessary condition for FMS. The\nversions that offer only a sufficient condition for FMS seem more\nplausible since they leave open alternative routes to FMS. But such\naccounts still leave the moral status of infants unaccounted for, and\npossibly on a par with that of dogs and rabbits. Of course, these\nviews nevertheless allow that there are very strong reasons not to\nkill human infants: it would be disrespectful and harmful to the\ninfant\u2019s parents, it would likely cause psychological harm to\nthe killers, etc. But these reasons, as explained in section 2.4, have\nnothing to do with the moral status of infants, since they are not\nreasons for the infants\u2019 own sake (Feinberg 1980, p. 198 and\nMcMahan 2002, p. 232).\n",
