    "main_text": "The sense of body ownership\n4. The sense of body ownership\n\nAccording to Peacocke (2014, 2017), we must distinguish among three\ndegrees of self-representations:\n\nDegree 0: Mental states that do not represent anything as standing\nin certain relations to the subject. For example, a proprioceptive\nexperience with nonconceptual content of the type [this leg is\nbent].\nDegree 1: Mental states whose nonconceptual content represents the\nsubject as standing in relations to other objects and events. For\nexample, a proprioceptive experience with nonconceptual content of the\ntype [my leg is bent].\n Degree 2: Mental states that can use the conceptual first person.\nFor example, a proprioceptive judgment with conceptual content of the\ntype [my leg is bent].\n\n\nTheories of the sense of bodily ownership try to answer the\nfollowing question: how does one go from degree 0 to degree 2, from a\nproprioceptive experience with the nonconceptual content [this leg is\nbent] to a proprioceptive judgment with the conceptual content [my leg\nis bent]? These theories pursue two objectives. First, to avoid\npositing new phenomenal properties unless necessary (Wu forthcoming).\nSecondly, to account for empirical data. On the one hand, the rubber\nhand illusion provides an experimental window in what is required for\none to experience a hand as one\u2019s own. On the other hand, one\nneeds to understand how it is possible for an individual not\nto experience one\u2019s limb as one\u2019s own in disownership\nsyndromes, as in somatoparaphrenia (Romano & Maravita 2019), depersonalization disorder (Billon\n2017), Cotard syndrome (Billon 2015, 2016), and xenomelia (Brugger et\nal. 2013), as well as in chronic pain (Moseley et al. 2012) and\ncomplex post-traumatic disorder (Ataria 2018). The interpretation of\nthese various results, however, is controversial (Alsmith 2015; Wu\nforthcoming; Bradley forthcoming; Chadha 2018), and at most one can\nonly offer an inference to the best explanation.\n",
