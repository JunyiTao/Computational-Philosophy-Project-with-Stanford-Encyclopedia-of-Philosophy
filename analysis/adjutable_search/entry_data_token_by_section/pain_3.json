    "main_text": "The common-sense conception of pain || The tension between the two threads\n1.3 The tension between the two threads\n\nNow that the two threads in our ordinary conception of pain are in\nfull view, we can better appreciate why they are in tension.\nExperiences are in the head, if they are anywhere. Indeed, for most\nphysicalists, they are in the head by being realized in the brain or\nin the central nervous system. So we can\u2019t be locating pains\nqua experiences (or qua sensations, for that matter)\nin body parts when we correctly utter sentences such as (1) through\n(6) \u2014 discounting headaches perhaps. But then what are we\nlocating when we seem to attribute pains to body parts? Recall that,\nalthough the first thread in our common-sense conception treats pains\nas spatiotemporally locatable particulars or particular conditions of\nbody parts, it does not identify pains with them \u2014 it only\nexerts pressure towards such an identification in the light of the\nfact that there doesn\u2019t seem to be any other credible\nalternative (but see below). We have already conducted a little\nthought-experiment to bring this out in Section 1.1. Comparing the\nfollowing two sentences will help us understand the tension\nbetter:\n\n\n(5) I feel a sharp pain in the back of my right hand.\n\n(9) I see a dark discoloration on the back of my right hand.\n\n\nIt is reasonably clear that for (9) to be true, I have to stand in the\nseeing (perceiving) relation to a dark discoloration on the back of my\nright hand, i.e., to a certain surface region on the back of my hand\nmarked by a darker shade of the usual color of my skin, a certain\nregion that can be seen by others possibly in the same way in which I\nsee it. Note that if I am hallucinating a dark discoloration on the\nback of my hand, then (9) is simply false. Also note that although the\ntruth of (9) doesn\u2019t require the possession of any concept by me\nexpressed by the words making up the sentence, my uttering of (9) to\nmake a report typically does \u2014 if we take such\nutterances as expressions of one\u2019s thoughts and take thoughts to\nbe composed of concepts. So my seeing would typically induce me to\nconceptually identify something on the back of my hand as a\ndark discoloration. This is a typical case of categorization of\nsomething extramental under a concept induced by an exteroceptive\nexperience. Of course, my uttering of (9) does more than attribute a\nphysical property to a bodily region: it also reports that I am seeing\nit.\n\nWhat has to be the case for (5) to be true? Whatever the complete\nanalysis of sentences like (5) turns out to be, one thing seems\nreasonably clear: the truth-conditions of (5) put no constraints\nwhatsoever on how things physically are with my hand. Anyone\nwho has a sufficient mastery of our ordinary concept of pain has no\ndifficulty in understanding how (5) could still be true even though\nthere is nothing physically wrong with my hand, which is typically the\ncase in centrally caused chronic pain\n syndromes.[2]\n\nSo we standardly use sentences like (5) to make correct statements\nabout a pain felt in a bodily location even when there may be nothing\nwrong with that location. In other words, when we make claims about\nwhere it hurts (attribute pain to bodily locations), strictly speaking\nwe in fact refrain from logically committing ourselves to there being\nanything physically wrong in those locations \u2014 even though we\nnormally expect to find some physical disorder in them. Compare this\nto my uttering (9) on the basis of my having a very vivid visual\nhallucination of a discoloration on the back of my hand. In such a\ncase, my utterance would be incorrect, because in uttering (9) I\ncommit myself to finding some physical condition (namely, a dark\ndiscoloration) on the back of my hand. If and when I realize that I\nhave hallucinated, then I correct myself and revert to introspective\nmode by saying things like \u201cI seemed to see a discoloration on\nthe back of my hand\u201d or \u201cit appeared to me that there was\na discoloration,\u201d etc. Nothing of this sort happens when I\nrealize or am told that there is nothing physically wrong with my\nhand: I still correctly continue to report the pain I feel\nthere by uttering the very same sentence, (5), or its equivalents. I\ndon\u2019t need to make any correction in my pain report. This shows\nthat despite the pressure exerted by the first thread, it is the\nsecond thread that seems to capture the dominant common-sense\nconception of pain \u2014 as indeed the IASP definition above\nindicates.\n\nStill the puzzle remains: what is it that I am doing when I appear to\nbe attributing something to the back of my hand by correctly uttering\n(5) \u2014 if, as agreed, I am not attributing a mental experience or\na physical condition there? It is not clear whether there is a\ncommon-sense answer to this question. Just as the scientific\ndefinition doesn\u2019t touch on the issue of our common practice of\ncorrectly locating pains in healthy body parts, the common\nsense would probably draw a blank if the problem were articulated\nexplicitly and the question is pressed really hard.\n\nOr maybe not. Intuitively and somewhat naively, what common sense\nwould drive us to say when pressed hard might be something\nlike the\n following.[3]\n Granted, by uttering (5) I am not attributing any sort of physical\nthing or condition to the back of my hand, nor am I locating a mental\nexperience there \u2014 experiences and sensations are strictly\nspeaking in the head if they are anywhere. But when I attend to my\nhand with my mind\u2019s inner eye, so to speak, I clearly feel\nsomething there. I can introspectively examine different\nqualities of that thing such as its sharpness, volume, intensity,\nunpleasantness, burning quality, etc. I can in real time follow the\nchanges in it: it is now somewhat less intense and unpleasant, now\nmore; it is getting duller now, it was sharper and brighter a moment\nago; it seems to be moving toward my fingers, etc. Clearly, I seem to\nbe confronted or acquainted with spatially located something\nthat I can introspectively examine carefully in real time and report\non its various qualities. It is this thing, the object of my inner\nattention, which is located in the back of my hand, which seems\nessentially private, subjective, and about which I can\u2019t be\nwrong.\n\nIf this is what one might like to say intuitively and naively, one\nshould be prepared to swallow its strange consequences: this\nobject of my inner attention is both located in public space\nand logically private, that is, only I can have epistemic access to it\ndespite its being spatiotemporally located. Also, the existence of\nthis object seems to literally depend on my epistemic access to it: it\nseems to go out of existence when I cease to feel it\n(perceive it). In addition, if it is the object of my\nattention (separate from my attention), how could it be the case that\nI cannot be wrong about it? And importantly, if this object is not\nphysical, what sort of thing could it be? A ghostly mental particular\nthat I can introspectively attend to which is nevertheless\nspatiotemporally located beyond my head?\n\nThe act-object duality embedded in our ordinary concept of pain yields\nstrange results when followed intuitively and naively to its logical\nend. But perhaps this duality is a robust symptom of a deeper truth\nunderlying all perception and introspection. Perhaps pain is simply\nthe most paradigmatic example of a broad range of perceptual\nexperiences where this deep underlying iceberg shows its tip most\nprominently and revealingly \u2014 albeit confusedly. Indeed this is\nexactly the case according to so-called sense-datum theories.\n",
