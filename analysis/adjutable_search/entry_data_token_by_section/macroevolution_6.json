Passive vs. Driven Trends\n\nPaleontologists have long been interested in documenting and\nexplaining larger-scale evolutionary trends in the fossil record\n(McShea 1998). Perhaps the classic example of a macroevolutionary\ntrend, and one that paleontologists have studied extensively, is\nCope\u2019s rule of size increase. Paleontologists routinely\ndistinguish within-lineage trends (e.g., average size increase within\na single lineage) from among-lineage trends (e.g., increase in the\naverage size of mammals over the Cenozoic). The latter are\ndistinctively macro-level patterns. While it might be tempting to\nthink that trends such as evolutionary size increase are generally\nattributable to natural selection, Stanley (1973) pointed out that\nthese trends could be merely statistical phenomena. Suppose that a\nclade, such as mammals, starts out at or near a fixed lower boundary\non body size. And suppose that evolutionary size increases and\ndecreases are equally probable. As the clade evolves, the mean body\nsize might do a \u201crandom walk\u201d away from the fixed\nboundary\u2014an idea that Gould (1996) later popularlized. Many\nscientists also think of this as a passive diffusion model of\nevolutionary change.\n\nThe notion of a passive trend is closely related to other themes of\nmacroevolutionary theory. Gould, in particular, was enthusiastic about\nthe possibility that Cope\u2019s rule might be a passive trend. If\nthat were the case, then it would mean that evolutionary size increase\nis not attributable to natural selection. What\u2019s more, if we\nexplain size increase by supposing it to be a passive trend, then the\nexplanation need not reference any micro-level causes. The fixed\nboundary in the state space could be maintained by developmental\nconstraints\u2014another favorite theme of Gould\u2019s. And\nfinally, a trend resulting from a random walk away from a fixed\nboundary would not seem to be progressive at all. To the extent that\nlarger-scale evolutionary trends are passive, chance looks like a more\nsignificant factor in evolutionary history, and selection looks like a\nless significant one.\n\nMcShea (1994) gave one widely-cited formulation of the distinction\nbetween passive and driven trends, and also suggested several\napproaches for determining, empirically, whether a trend is passive or\ndriven. One such approach is the stable minimum test: track, say, the\nbody size of the smallest members of the clade. If that increases\nsteadily over time, it is a signal that the trend is driven.\nPaleobiologists now routinely try to determine whether trends are\npassive or driven, though this work can sometimes encounter\nunderdetermination issues (Turner 2009). Body size has received a lot\nof empirical attention, in part because it is easy to estimate from\nfragmentary fossil remains, and partly for the simple reason that it\nis a trait that every animal has.\n\nIn addition to its role in the development of macroevolutionary theory\nand its influence on scientific research, the passive/driven\ndistinction raises a number of philosophical issues. As noted already,\nthe notion of a passive trend links up with a traditional set of\nquestions about the role of chance or randomness in evolution\n(Millstein 2000). Indeed, the passive/driven distinction looks a lot\nlike the distinction between random genetic drift and selection in\npopulation genetics. Drift could be construed as a passive trend in\ngene frequencies. Grantham (1999) argues that the notion of a passive\ntrend points toward a certain sort of explanatory pluralism: a trend\nthat is best explained as a stochastic phenomenon at the macro-level\ncould receive a more deterministic explanation at a lower level, and\nthose explanations need not conflict. Turner (2014) suggests that the\nnotion of a passive trend poses a challenge to popular interventionist\nideas about causal explanation. Explaining a trend by showing that it\nis passive could turn out to be a non-causal explanatory strategy.\n\nOne issue that remains under-explored, philosophically, is how the\ndistinction between passive vs. driven larger-scale trends might\nintersect with philosophical disagreements about whether neo-Darwinian\nevolutionary theory is best understood as a causal theory (a view\ngiven its canonical formulation by Sober 1984) or a statistical theory\n(Matthen and Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew 2002). There may be\nsome question about whether it is best to understand the\npassive/driven distinction as a distinction between trends generated\nby different causal mechanisms, vs. a distinction between different\nsorts of statistical phenomena.\n",
