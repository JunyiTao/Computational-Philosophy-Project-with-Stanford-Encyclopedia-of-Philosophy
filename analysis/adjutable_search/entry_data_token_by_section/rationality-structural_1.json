    "main_text": "What is Structural Rationality? || Key Characteristics of Structural Rationality\n1.2 Key Characteristics of Structural Rationality\n\nAs we have already seen, evaluations of structural rationality concern\nthe coherence of one\u2019s mental states. However, we can get a\nsharper focus on the notion of structural rationality by identifying\nsome further often identified features of evaluations of structural\nrationality or irrationality, which are supposed to distinguish them\nfrom evaluations of substantive rationality or irrationality.\n\nFirst, structural rationality typically concerns combinations\nof attitudes (and absences thereof), rather than individual\nattitudes (and absences thereof). Consider someone who believes \\(p\\)\nand believes not-\\(p\\). Either or both beliefs may fail to be\nsubstantively rational if they are ill-supported by the agent\u2019s\nepistemic reasons. But the structural irrationality lies in the\ncombination, not in either individual belief. The same is true of, for\nexample, intending to \\(\\Phi\\), believing that in order to \\(\\Phi\\)\none must \\(\\Psi\\), but not intending to \\(\\Psi\\). Again, one or more\nof these states may fail to be individually substantively rational,\nbut the structural irrationality lies in the combination. However, it\nis controversial whether structural rationality always\nconcerns combinations of attitudes, rather than individual attitudes.\nBroome (2013: 153), for example, suggests that a belief in a\nconjunctive proposition of the form \\((p\\) & not-\\(p)\\) is, on its\nown, structurally irrational. Nor is it distinctive of\nstructural rationality that it concerns combinations of attitudes.\nThere may be failures of substantive rationality that obtain\nspecifically in virtue of a combination of attitudes: for example, it\nmight not be substantively rational to intend to go to a job interview\ntomorrow and intend to wear swim shorts tomorrow, even if\neither of these intentions is rationally permitted on its own.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, evaluations of the structural rationality of\nsome combination of attitudes can be made independently of judgments\nabout which (if any) of the individual attitudes within the\ncombination of attitude is substantively rational, or adequately\nsupported by reasons. For example, suppose that Ravi believes that all\ntaxes are illegitimate, while also believing that income taxes are\nlegitimate. A left-liberal might judge that Ravi has good reasons for\nthe second belief but not the first, while an anarcho-capitalist might\njudge the reverse, and a political agnostic might have no views about\nwhich of Ravi\u2019s beliefs, if either, is supported by good\nreasons. Yet this should be no barrier to all three agreeing that\nRavi\u2019s combination of beliefs is structurally\nirrational. Similarly, even when we disagree about whether some end is\nworth pursuing, we should be able to agree that intending that end\nwhile not intending the believed means to it is structurally\nirrational.\n\nThird, evaluations of structural rationality can be made without\nknowing anything about the situation of the agent being evaluated, or\nabout the agent\u2019s information about their situation. In this\nrespect, they again contrast with evaluations of substantive\nrationality. Whether it is substantively rational for you to intend to\ngo to medical school depends on the information available to you about\nyour likely chances of succeeding in medical school, the costs of\ngoing, whether being a doctor would be a career you\u2019d enjoy, and\nso on. We cannot possibly evaluate the substantive rationality of your\nintention to go to medical school without knowing what information is\navailable to you about these matters. But if you simultaneously intend\nto go to medical school, believe that to do so you must take the\nentrance exam, and yet do not intend to take the entrance exam, then\nwe can tell that you are structurally irrational, without needing to\nknow this sort of information.\n\nFinally, evaluations of structural rationality may be called\nformal in the sense that we can tell whether combinations of\nattitudes are structurally irrational even when abstracting at least\nsomewhat from their content. So, for example, it\u2019s always\nstructurally irrational to believe \\(p\\) and believe not-\\(p\\), for\nany proposition \\(p\\), regardless of its content. Similarly, the\nmeans-end requirement says (or entails) that it is irrational to\nintend to \\(\\Phi\\), to believe that to \\(\\Phi\\) one must \\(\\Psi\\), and\nnot intend to \\(\\Psi\\), for any actions \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\Psi\\),\nregardless of what they are.\n",
