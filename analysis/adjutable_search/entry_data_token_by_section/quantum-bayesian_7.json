    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Solipsist?\n2.1 Solipsist?\n\nA common reaction among those first hearing about QBism is to dismiss\nit as a form of solipsism. Mermin (2017) replies as follows:\n\n\nFacile charges of solipsism miss the point. My experience of you leads\nme to hypothesize that you are a being very much like myself, with\nyour own private experience. This is as firm a belief as any I have. I\ncould not function without it. If asked to assign this hypothesis a\nprobability I would choose 1.0.\nAlthough I have no direct personal access to your own experience, an\nimportant component of my private experience is the impact on me of\nyour efforts to communicate, in speech or writing, your verbal\nrepresentations of your own experience. Science is a collaborative\nhuman effort to find, through our individual actions on the world and\nour verbal communications with each other, a model for what is common\nto all of our privately constructed external worlds. Conversations,\nconferences, research papers, and books are an essential part of the\nscientific process. (84\u201385)\n\n\nIn his critical assessment of quantum Bayesianism, Timpson (2008)\noffers a more detailed defense against the charge of solipsism.\n\nBut even if one accepts the existence of other people and their\nexperiences, adopting QBism does seem severely to restrict one\u2019s\napplication of quantum theory to anticipations of one\u2019s own\nexperiences, with no implications for those of anyone else.\n",
