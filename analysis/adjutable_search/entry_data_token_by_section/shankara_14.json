    "main_text": "Contemplative Philosophical Methods || The Triple Process and the Means of Nondual Knowledge\n4.3 Self-Knowledge and Living While Liberated\n\nHow to exactly define liberation in \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s thought\nis inherently problematic. He does not provide a precise\nepistemological account of how knowledge of brahman takes\nplace. \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s conception of liberation removes\nitself from the boundaries of ordinary discourse, debate, and causal\nepistemology (See TaiUBh 2.9.1 for example). There is a metaphysical\nuncertainty about it, for on the one hand a liberating cognition may\nbe able to remove self-ignorance, but on the other it is problematic\nto reduce ever-present liberation to a cognition which is a product\nand a temporal event. From the empirical perspective liberation may be\ninexplicable and indeterminable due to its transition to ultimate\nnondual reality.\n\nPerhaps the greatest difficulty is describing what \u015aa\u1e45kara\nthought about the transition from what appears to be descriptive\nknowledge to direct knowledge, or from a type of modal knowledge to a\nknowledge of intrinsic being that is pure consciousness. In his view,\nunderstanding the Upani\u1e63adic identity statement generates a\nunique cognition revealing the veridical knowledge, \u201cI am\nbrahman\u201d\u2014that one is indiscernible from nondual\nconsciousness, numerically identical with brahman, and the\nreality of everything. This knowledge removes root ignorance to negate\nsuperimposition veiling one\u2019s true nature. It strips all\nqualifications and relationships from consciousness, deconstructs the\nI-sense and knower-ship as unreal, and deindividuates the individual\nfrom all conditioning adjuncts (see Ram-Prasad 2001b: ch. 4). Then\nsuffering, karma, and rebirth have no locus in which to cling\nbecause only nondual consciousness remains.\n\nNondual knowledge does not entail subject-object distinction like\nobject cognitions because its content is identical to the\nconsciousness illuminating the cognition. Its content is\nbrahman itself (see, e.g., TaiUBh 2.1.1; MuUBh 3.1.2, 4; and\nBrS\u016bBh 2.1.14). There is no call to apperceive this knowledge for\nthe sake of a truth certifying inference. Extrinsic certification\ncannot determine its veridicality because intrinsic consciousness\n(svar\u016bpaj\u00f1\u0101nam) is self-illuminating and\ncannot be known by a second cognition. Its self-illumination entails\nits self-certification when directly known. The cognition\u2019s\nmodal form (vrttij\u00f1\u0101nam), however, is analogous\nto a self-immolating match. By recognizing its content, it\ncannibalizes its own modal form. It reveals its own modal appearance\nas an appearance, which is only brahman. In this process it loses its\nstatus as a means of knowledge, akin to a means of knowledge in a\ndream (BhGBh 2.69).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara uses the analogy of waking up from dreaming to\nillustrate understanding nonduality and the non-realism of the world\n(BrS\u016bBh 2.1.14). He does not characterize this as a mystical\nstate of union, an extraordinary oceanic experience, or a state of no\nmind. In fact, one cannot describe this knowledge as an experiential\nstate because states are objectifiable cognitions. Furthermore, this\nknowledge ostensibly negates experiential agency. His liberation is a\npurely epistemic shift that removes false conceptual constructions.\nFrom an epistemic perspective, \u015aa\u1e45kara sees the liberated\nperson as having no more dealings concerned with actions, instruments,\nand results. They have no more perception of duality, and possess no\nmore self-identity with the mind and body (B\u1e5bUBh 2.4.14,\n4.5.15); however, from a phenomenal perspective, liberation does not\nentail an annihilation of one\u2019s experience of the world\n(BrS\u016bBh 3.2.21). This is like a magician who remains unconfused\ndespite perceiving their own magical illusions. The liberated person\nrecognizes nonduality but continues living as an embodied individual\nexperiencing the world. This lasts according to the ongoing\nfructification of karma in their present birth (ChUbh\n6.14.2). One who is \u201cliving while liberated\u201d\n(j\u012bvanmukti) seamlessly inhabits the apparent paradoxes\nof being disembodied in the midst of embodiment, of acting while\nrecognizing their non-agency, and of perceiving the world despite\ndeindividuation. (See Fort 1998 on j\u012bvanmukti).\n\nA lucid dream experience is an ideal illustration of\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s liberation, though not found in his work.\nFor experienced lucid dreamers, the recognition that one is dreaming\npossesses a conviction that completely cuts through the appearance of\nthe dream fabric, but does so without eliminating perceptual dream\nexperience. They are epistemically aware of two orders of reality,\nwaking and dreaming, while phenomenally remaining in the less real\ndreaming order. The lucid dreamer is deindividuated from the dream\nbody, yet remains embodied within the dream experience. They recognize\nthat the dream is not separate from themselves, that it cannot touch\nthem, and that there is nothing to fear or gain from it. In\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s metaphysical view however, the empirical\norder is analogous to \u012b\u015bvara\u2019s dream, not\none\u2019s own. This view accommodates the universe\u2019s identity\nwith \u012b\u015bvara, along with intersubjective agreement\nand veridical cognition, without falling into solipsism. The\nindividual is not creating empirical reality, but rather making a\nmistake about it. Like the dream, empirical reality is not illusory\nfrom within its own order of reality. It is known as a virtual\nappearance only from the more foundational perspective of knowing\nbrahman, analogous to awakening to the reality of the dream.\nThe liberated person is like a finite dream being within\n\u012b\u015bvara\u2019s cosmic dream who has awakened within\nthe dream. They recognize that the immediate presence of consciousness\nis the single foundation grounding all objects, the single self of all\nbeings, and the self of \u012b\u015bvara.\n",
