Grammar and Meaning\n\n\nIn \u201cLogik und Erkenntnistheorie,\u201d Schlick thought\nthe most important component of languages are grammatical rules, which\nare of two kinds. First of all, there are \u2018internal\nrules\u2019, which govern the use of expressions in relation to other\nexpressions, much like the formation and transformation rules of formal\nlogic. In addition, Schlick conceived of a second type of\ngrammatical rule, which he called \u2018application-rules\u2019\n(Anwendungsregeln), regulating the use of expressions in\nconnection with, or application to, observable extra-linguistic\nsituations. Of course, application-rules govern not only\ndescriptions of observable situations, but the use of indexicals and\ndemonstratives as well, thus legitimizing Schlick\u2019s affirmations\nby grounding them in grammar. And Schlick conceived grammar with\nsufficient breadth to encompass the natural languages of everyday life\nas well as the technical and highly regimented languages of\nscience. Concurring with Carnap\u2019s Principle of Tolerance,\nSchlick regarded the choice of grammatical rules, the choice of a\nparticular grammar rather than an alternative, as conventional and\ntherefore independent of extra-linguistic matters. And his\nendorsement of grammatical conventionalism was specifically intended to\naccommodate choices between languages which differed radically, as\ndemonstrated in his treatment of philosophical pseudo-problems\n(Oberdan 1996, Sec. 3).\n\n\nSchlick presented his latest conception of grammar as well as its\napplication to philosophical pseudo-problems in his 1936 essay on\n\u201cMeaning and Verification\u201d (Schlick 1979b,\n456\u2013481). In particular, he demonstrated that the criterion of\nverifiability is rooted in grammar and concerns any grammatically\nwell-formed proposition which is neither analytic nor\ncontradictory. He reiterated his conception of grammar as the\ncollection of rules governing the formation and use of meaningful\nexpressions, including the rules governing the use of language in\nconnection with experience, rules which are introduced by acts of\nostension (Schlick 1979b, 464\u20137). Although the result is an\nanalysis of language which provides a powerful treatment of many\n\u2018typical\u2019 metaphysical theses, like Platonism,\npsychologism, and phenomenalism, in \u201cMeaning and\nVerification\u201d Schlick demonstrated its utility by applying it to\nsolipsism. The upshot is that solipsism is a contingent truth which is\ntreated by its defenders as unfalsifiable. But statements which are\ninsulated from the possibility of falsification are object-language\n\u2018mis-expressions\u2019 of what are, at bottom, grammatical\nrules. The parallel with Carnap\u2019s analysis of pseudo-object sentences\nas metalinguistic assertions rather than \u2018real-object\u2019\nsentences could not be more striking. And just as Carnap regarded the\nformal mode translations of philosophical theses as proposals to adopt\na certain language form, Schlick contended that the solipsist\u2019s thesis\nwas not a bona fide contingent claim but simply an attempt to\nintroduce a particular mode of speech. Thus, by the time of\n\u201cMeaning and Verification\u201d, he had moved well beyond his\n\u2018Form and Content\u2019 stage, modulating the virulent\nPositivism of his earlier thinking, to arrive at a more mature and\nbalanced conception of the issues at the focus of his philosophical\nconcerns (Oberdan 1996, Sec. 5).\n",
