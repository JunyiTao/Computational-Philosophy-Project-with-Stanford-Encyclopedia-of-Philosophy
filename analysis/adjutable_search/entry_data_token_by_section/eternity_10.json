    "main_text": "Arguments against Divine Timelessness || Arguments from Divine Action\n5.2 Arguments from Divine Action\n\nOne might reason as follows. When God creates the universe, God begins\nto stand in the relation of coexisting with to the universe,\nand also in the relation of sustaining it in existence.\nAcquiring these and other relations to the universe makes God\ntemporal, because it constitutes a change that God undergoes at the\nmoment of creation. Even if God was timeless before, God is temporal\nafter creation (Craig 2009).\n\nThe problem with this line of thought is again that it is not clear\nhow to understand the notions of before and after, of acquiring, and\nof beginning, as applied to a timeless God.\n\nHowever, the point can be made in another way. God is thought to be\ncausally active in the world, where those causal relations include\nGod\u2019s responding to petitionary prayer and being actively\ninvolved in world history. Similarly, God coexists with the world and\nsustains it in existence at every moment. God loves, and knows about\nthe lives of, God\u2019s creatures. All these are relations. God\nstands in causal and other relations to a temporal world.\nDoesn\u2019t this make God temporal (Mullins 2016, Ch. 5)?\n\nEach version of divine timelessness tries to address this concern in\nsome way. One somewhat radical response, given by Aquinas and others,\nis that while the world is related to God, God is not related to the\nworld.\n",
