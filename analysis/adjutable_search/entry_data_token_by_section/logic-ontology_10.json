(O2)\n\nOne interesting view about the relationship between formal languages,\nontology, and meta-ontology is the one developed by Carnap in the\nfirst half of the 20th century, and which is one of the starting\npoints of the contemporary debate in ontology, leading to the\nwell-known exchange between Carnap and Quine, to be discussed below.\nAccording to Carnap one crucial project in philosophy is to develop\nframeworks that can be used by scientists to formulate\ntheories of the world. Such frameworks are formal languages that have\na clearly defined relationship to experience or empirical evidence as\npart of their semantics. For Carnap it was a matter of usefulness and\npracticality which one of these frameworks will be selected by the\nscientists to formulate their theories in, and there is no one correct\nframework that truly mirrors the world as it is in itself. The\nadoption of one framework rather than another is thus a practical\nquestion.\n\nCarnap distinguished two kinds of questions that can be asked about\nwhat there is. One are the so-called \u2018internal questions\u2019,\nquestions like \u2018Are there infinitely many prime numbers?\u2019\nThese questions make sense once a framework that contains talk about\nnumbers has been adopted. Such questions vary in degree of difficulty.\nSome are very hard, like \u2018Are there infinitely many twin prime\nnumbers?\u2019, some are of medium difficulty, like \u2018Are there\ninfinitely many prime numbers?\u2019, some are easy like \u2018Are\nthere prime numbers?\u2019, and some are completely trivial, like\n\u2018Are there numbers?\u2019. Internal questions are thus\nquestions that can be asked once a framework that allows talk about\ncertain things has been adopted, and general internal questions, like\n\u2018Are there numbers?\u2019 are completely trivial since once the\nframework of talk about numbers has been adopted the question if there\nare any is settled within that framework.\n\nBut since the internal general questions are completely trivial they\ncan\u2019t be what the philosophers and metaphysicians are after when\nthey ask the ontological question \u2018Are there numbers?\u2019 The\nphilosophers aim to ask a difficult and deep question, not a trivial\none. What the philosophers aim to ask, according to Carnap, is not a\nquestion internal to the framework, but external to it. They aim to\nask whether the framework correctly corresponds to reality, whether or\nnot there really are numbers. However, the words used in the\nquestion \u2018Are there numbers?\u2019 only have meaning within the\nframework of talk about numbers, and thus if they are meaningful at\nall they form an internal question, with a trivial answer. The\nexternal questions that the metaphysician tries to ask are\nmeaningless. Ontology, the philosophical discipline that tries to\nanswer hard questions about what there really is is based on\na mistake. The question it tries to answer are meaningless questions,\nand this enterprise should be abandoned. The words \u2018Are there\nnumbers?\u2019 thus can be used in two ways: as an internal question,\nin which case the answer is trivially \u2018yes\u2019, but this has\nnothing to do with metaphysics or ontology, or as an external\nquestion, which is the one the philosophers are trying to ask, but\nwhich is meaningless. Philosophers should thus not be concerned with\n(O2), which is a discipline that tries to answer meaningless\nquestions, but with (L1), which is a discipline that, in part,\ndevelops frameworks for science to use to formulate and answer real\nquestions. Carnap\u2019s ideas about ontology and meta-ontology are\ndeveloped in a classic essay (Carnap 1956b). A nice summary of\nCarnap\u2019s views can be found in his intellectual autobiography\n(Carnap 1963).\n\nCarnap\u2019s rejection of ontology, and metaphysics more generally,\nhas been widely criticized from a number of different angles. One\ncommon criticism is that it relies on a too simplistic conception of\nnatural language that ties it too closely to science or to evidence\nand verification. In particular, Carnap\u2019s more general rejection\nof metaphysics used a verificationist conception of meaning, which is\nwidely seen as too simplistic. Carnap\u2019s rejection of ontology\nhas been criticized most prominently by Quine, and the debate between\nCarnap and Quine on ontology is a classic in this field. Quine\nrejected Carnap\u2019s conception that when scientists are faced with\ndata that don\u2019t fit their theory they have two choices. First\nthey could change the theory, but stay in the same framework.\nSecondly, they could move to a different framework, and formulate a\nnew theory within that framework. These two moves for Carnap are\nsubstantially different. Quine would want to see them as fundamentally\nsimilar. In particular, Quine rejects the idea that there could be\ntruths which are the trivial internal statements, like \u201cThere\nare numbers\u201d, whose truth is a given once the framework of\nnumbers has been adopted. Thus some such internal statements would be\nanalytic truths, and Quine is well known for thinking that the\ndistinction between analytic and synthetic truths is untenable. Thus\nCarnap\u2019s distinction between internal and external questions is\nto be rejected alongside with the rejection of the distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic truths. On the other hand, Quine and Carnap\nagree that ontology in the traditional philosophical sense is to be\nrejected. Traditionally ontology has often, but not always, been an\narmchair, a priori, investigation into the fundamental building blocks\nof reality. As such it is completely separated from science. Quine\n(1951) rejects this approach to ontology since he holds that there\ncan\u2019t be such an investigation into reality that is completely\nseparate and prior to the rest of inquiry. See Yablo 1998 for more\non the debate between Quine and Carnap, which contains many references\nto the relevant passages. The view on ontological commitment discussed\nin section 4.1., which is usually attributed to Quine, was developed\nas a reaction to Carnap\u2019s position discussed in this\nsection. Simply put, Quine\u2019s view is that to see what we are\ncommitted to we have to see what our best overall theory of the world\nquantifies over. In particular, we look at our best overall scientific\ntheory of the world, which contains physics and the rest.\n\nCarnap\u2019s arguments for the rejection of ontology are presently\nwidely rejected. However, several philosophers have recently attempted\nto revive some parts or others of Carnap\u2019s ideas. For example,\nStephen Yablo has argued that an internal-external distinction could\nbe understood along the lines of the fictional-literal distinction.\nAnd he argues (Yablo 1998) that since there is no fact about this\ndistinction, ontology, in the sense of (O2), rests on a mistake and is\nto be rejected, as Carnap did. On the other hand, Thomas Hofweber has\nargued that an internal-external distinction with many of the features\nthat Carnap wanted can be defended on the basis of facts about natural\nlanguage, but that such a distinction will not lead to a rejection of\nontology, in the sense of (O2). See Hofweber 2016. Hilary Putnam\n(1987) has developed a view that revives some of the pragmatic aspects\nof Carnap\u2019s position. See Sosa 1993 for a critical discussion of\nPutnam\u2019s view, and Sosa 1999 for a related, positive\nproposal. Robert Kraut (2016) has defended an expressivist reading of\nthe internal-external distinction, and with it some Carnapian\nconsequences for ontology. And most of all, Eli Hirsch and Amie\nThomasson have defended different versions of approaches to ontology\nthat capture a good part of the spirit of Carnap\u2019s view. See in\nparticular Hirsch 2011 and Thomasson 2015. For various views about the\neffects of Carnap on the contemporary debate in ontology, see Blatti\nand Lapointe 2016.\n",
