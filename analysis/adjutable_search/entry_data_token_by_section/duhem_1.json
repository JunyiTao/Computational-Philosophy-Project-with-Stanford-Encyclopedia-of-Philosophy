    "main_text": "Philosophy of Science\n2. Philosophy of Science\n\n\nDuhem\u2019s early methodological views reflected late\nnineteenth-century positivism: Physical theory was no more than an aid\nto memory, summarizing and classifying facts by providing a symbolic\nrepresentation of them; the facts of physical theory are different from\ncommon sense and metaphysics, especially from the mechanical theories\nfashionable at the time. Duhem\u2019s position was immediately\nattacked by a Catholic engineer, Eug\u00e8ne Vicaire, on the grounds\nthat separating physics from metaphysics implied that physics was the\nonly real knowledge (another positivistic thesis), and thus conceded\ntoo much to skepticism. Vicaire raised an important point for\nturn-of-the-century Catholics because the Church was officially\ncommitted to neo-Thomism, with its generally rationalist apologetics\n(see Martin 1991, chap. 2). In his reply Duhem adopted a quasi-Thomist\nposition: metaphysics is a real form of knowledge, more excellent than\nphysics, but separated from it in that it has different objects and is\ngoverned by different methods. This immediate response fitted\nreasonably well into the framework of neo-Thomism, though it did not go\nas far as to reunite the disparate forms of knowledge into a\nhierarchical system of sciences including cosmology and metaphysics.\nDuhem\u2019s mature position was somewhat different, containing three\nkey ideas elaborated upon on various occasions: (1) the\nunderdetermination of theory by fact, often referred to as the Duhem\nThesis, (2) the rejection of metaphysics and models in physics, and (3)\nnatural classification as the endpoint of physical theory.\n",
