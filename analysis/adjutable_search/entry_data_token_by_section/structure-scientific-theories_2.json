    "main_text": "Introduction || Two Examples: Newtonian Mechanics and Population Genetics\n1.2 Two Examples: Newtonian Mechanics and Population Genetics\n\nTwo examples will be used to illustrate differences between the three\nviews: Newtonian mechanics and population genetics. While relativity\ntheory is the preferred theory of the Syntactic View,\nNewtonian mechanics is more straightforward. Somewhat permissively\nconstrued, the theory of Newtonian mechanics employs the basic\nconceptual machinery of inertial reference frames, centers of mass,\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion, etc., to describe the dynamics and\nkinematics of, among other phenomena, point masses acting\nvis-\u00e0-vis gravitational forces (e.g. the solar system) or with\nrespect to forces involved in collisions (e.g., pool balls on a pool\ntable; a closed container filled with gas). Newtonian mechanics is\nexplored in each section.\n\nPopulation genetics investigates the genetic composition of\npopulations of natural and domesticated species, including the\ndynamics and causes of changes in gene frequencies in such populations\n(for overviews, see Lloyd 1994 [1988]; Gould 2002; Pigliucci and\nM\u00fcller 2010; Okasha 2012). Population genetics emerged as a\ndiscipline with the early 20th century work of R.A. Fisher,\nSewall Wright, and J.B.S. Haldane, who synthesized Darwinian\nevolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics. One important part of\npopulation genetic theory is the Hardy-Weinberg Principle. HWP is a\nnull model mathematically stating that gene frequencies remain\nunchanged across generations when there is no selection, migration,\nrandom genetic drift, or other evolutionary forces acting in a given\npopulation. HWP peppers early chapters of many introductory textbooks\n(e.g., Crow and Kimura 1970; Hartl and Clark 1989; Bergstrom and\nDugatkin 2012). We return to HWP in Section 5 and here merely state\nquestions each view might ask about population genetics.\n\nThe Syntactic View focuses on questions regarding the highest\naxiomatic level of population genetics (e.g., Williams 1970, 1973; Van\nValen 1976; Lewis 1980; Tuomi 1981, 1992). Examples of such queries\nare:\n\nWhat would be the most convenient metamathematical axiomatization\nof evolutionary processes (e.g., natural selection, drift, migration,\nspeciation, competition)? In which formal language(s) would and could\nsuch axiomatizations be articulated (e.g., first-order predicate\nlogic, set theory, and category theory)?\nWhich single grammars could contain a variety of deep evolutionary\nprinciples and concepts, such as HWP, \u201cheritability,\u201d and\n\u201ccompetitive exclusion\u201d?\nWhich formal and methodological tools would permit a smooth flow\nfrom the metamathematical axiomatization to the mathematical theory of\npopulation genetics?\n\n\nInvestigations of the axiomatized rational reconstruction of theory\nshed light on the power and promises, and weaknesses and\nincompleteness, of the highest-level theoretical edifice of population\ngenetics. \n\nSecondly, the Semantic View primarily examines questions regarding the\nmathematical structure of population genetics (Lewontin 1974, Beatty\n1981; L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n 1987; Thompson 1989, 2007; Lloyd\n1994 [1988]). Very generally, this exploration involves the following\nquestions:\n\nWhat is the form and content of the directly presented class of\nmathematical models of evolutionary theory (e.g., HWP)? How could and\nshould we organize the cluster of mathematical models (sensu Levins\n1966) of population genetics?\nWhich additional models (e.g., diagrammatic, narrative, scale)\nmight be used to enrich our understanding of evolutionary theory?\nWhat are the relations among theoretical mathematical models, data\nmodels, and experimental models? How does theory explain and shape\ndata? How do the data constrain and confirm theory?\n\n\nThe main subject of investigation is mathematical structure, rather\nthan metamathematics or even alternative model types or modeling\nmethods. \n\nFinally, the Pragmatic View asks about the internal complexity of\npopulation genetic theory, as well as about the development and\ncontext of population genetics. In so doing, it inquires into how\npurposes and values have influenced the theoretical structure of\nevolutionary theory, selecting and shaping current population genetics\nfrom a wide variety of possible alternative theoretical articulations.\nThe following questions about the structure of population genetic\ntheory might be here addressed:\n\nWhat role did R.A. Fisher\u2019s interest in animal husbandry,\nand his tenure at Rothamsted Experimental Station, play in shaping his\ninfluential methodologies of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and\nexperimental design involving randomization, blocking, and factorial\ndesigns?\nHow did the development of computers and computational practices,\nstatistical techniques, and the molecularization of genetics, shape\ntheory and theorizing in population genetics, especially from the\n1980s to today?\nHow might normative context surrounding the concept of\n\u201crace\u201d impact the way concepts such as\n\u201cheritability\u201d and \u201clineage,\u201d or principles\nsuch as HWP, are deployed in population genetics?\n\n\nAs when studying an organism, the structure of theory cannot be\nunderstood independently of its history and function.\n",
