    "main_text": "Gamification || Special Topics\n7. Discussion and Further Directions\n\nThis entry presents an overview of current work at the interface of\nlogic and games. The topics surveyed fall in a number of strands\nincluding current logical analysis of games in the broadest sense,\ncontacts between logic and classical game theory, connections with\nprobability and with computation, and, lastly, the game-theoretic\ncontent of logic itself.\n\nAll this produced a perhaps bewildering variety of logical systems at\nthe interface with games. Yet, this entry also shows a certain unity\nin approach, since the same sort of (modal) logics turn out suitable\nto deal with quite different aspects of game structure and game play.\nMoreover, when we step back a little, broader perspectives across the\nspecific systems surveyed here arise.\n\nOne noteworthy phenomenon is the existence of two different styles of\nlogical analysis. Some logical systems \u2018zoom in\u2019 on\nparticular aspects of an activity or reasoning practice, providing\nmore detail than what is usually found in standard mathematical or\nphilosophical analysis. Other logical systems do the opposite, and\n\u2018zoom out\u2019 to general patterns that may not have been\nvisible at the more detailed level of the original practice.\n\nMost of the logical systems in this entry are of the fine-grained\n\u2018zooming-in\u2019 variety. Even so, coarse-grained logics of\nthe \u2018zooming-out\u2019 variety are interesting, too, as they\nmay highlight laws or general patterns in social behavior that lie\nbeyond the details attended to by games and game theory. One example\nis the current interest in logics for the abstract notion of\ndependence (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007;\nBaltag 2016). Many forms of dependence and independence\npermeate social life. Baltag and van Benthem\n(2021) present a simple modal base logic of functional\ndependence and independence which fits this perspective, suggesting an\nanalysis of strategies in extensive games as dynamic devices that\ncreate dependencies among players. Chen, Shi & Wang (2022, Other\nInternet Resources) then combine this framework, applied to strategic\ngames, with the modal preference logic discussed above to find a\ncommon logical structure underlying both competitive and cooperative\ngames. Another example of the logical search for generality in games\nis the proof-theoretic analysis of Hu and\nKaneko (2012) of the general postulates for social interaction\nin Johansen (1982).\n\nThe interface area of logic and games still is in statu\nnascendi. Correspondingly, there are obvious gaps and desiderata\non the logic side, which are reflected in the material in this\nentry.\n\nIn particular, one fundamental theme are syntactic perspectives on\ngame-theoretic reasoning. Samples of a proof-theoretic style of\nanalysis for play can be found in de Bruin\n(2005). More concretely, Zvesper\n(2010) analyzes classical results in epistemic game theory,\n(cf. Tan & Werlang 1988; Aumann\n1999), in terms of abstract modalities for belief and\noptimality, showing how a few simple proof rules from modal\n\u03bc-calculus can capture the essence of famous results in epistemic\ngame theory. Proof-theoretic aspects of logic have so far been\novershadowed by semantic analyses, although this situation is changing\nslowly (Artemov 2014; Kaneko 2002; Kaneko &\nSuzuki 2003). Model-based reasoning provides abstract semantic\nperspectives on games that can aid conceptual clarification, and the\ndiscovery of general laws. But it might turn out to be proof theory\nthat governs the concrete reasoning used in the semantics, and that\nmay be able to guide the context of justification in establishing\ngeneral facts about games.\n\nA further contact with logic that has been ignored in this entry is\nthe rich interface between games and descriptive set theory (Woodin\n2010; Kanamori 2003).\n\nIt should be stressed once more that logic is not the only formal\ndiscipline that throws light on games. Quantitative probability enters\nthe study of games in many ways, both in classical and in evolutionary\ngame theory. The interface of logic and games may well profit from the\nmany old and new contacts between logic and probability (Leitgeb\n2017; Lin & Kelly 2012;\nHarrison-Trainor, Holliday, & Icard 2016).\n\nAnother link that remained underrepresented in this entry are\ncomputational aspects. The study of games, play and players has\nnatural connections with computation and agency in computer science\nand AI (Gr\u00e4del, Thomas, & Wilke 2002;\nAbramsky 2008; Halpern 2013; Perea 2012; Brandenburger 2014).\nThe proper perspective on what has been presented here may well turn\nout to be a triangle of interfaces between logic, games, and\ncomputation.\n\nAs for still broader connections, we have not done justice to all\nlinks between logic, games and philosophy, of which more are found in\nStalnaker (1996, 1999). The same is true\nfor links to linguistics and psychology (Clark\n2012). In this language-oriented connection, one should also\nmention the work of Bjorndahl, Halpern, and\nPass (2017) on the natural language used in specifying games\nand reasoning about them, thus making game analysis more\ndescription-dependent.\n\nFinally, the main thrust of this entry is theoretical and\nfoundational. However, there also is a more practical aspect to logic\nand games. Logic plays a role in cognitive psychology and experimental\ngame theory, if only to identify testable hypotheses related to Theory\nof Mind or strategic reasoning (Ghosh,\nMeijering, & Verbrugge 2014; Ghosh & Verbrugge 2018; Bicchieri\n1993; Fagin, Halpern et al. 1995). Lastly, some work at the\ninterface of logic and games suggests outreach to the world of actual\nparlor games (van Ditmarsch & Kooi 2015;\nvan Benthem & Liu 2019).\n\nAll in all, the claim of this entry is a modest one. Logic and games\nform a natural combination, that may reveal interesting things when\npursued explicitly. Even so, too much logic may import too much of a\nformal apparatus, which may end up strangling the games perspective:\nlogical systems are infinite machineries that can easily overwhelm a\nconcrete game of interest. In short, the contact has to be managed\nwith care.\n",
