    "main_text": "Eriugena\u2019s Sources\n2. Eriugena\u2019s Sources\n\nDespite the claims of some nineteenth-century commentators, it is now\nclear that Eriugena did not have direct knowledge of the writings of\nPlotinus, Porphyry, or Proclus. He had almost no contact with pagan\nNeoplatonism in general (apart possibly from Priscianus Lydus and\nCalcidius\u2019 translation of the Timaeus). His familiarity\nwith Aristotle was also indirect\u2014through the anonymous but\nwidely circulated compilation, Categoriae decem, the\nPseudo-Augustinian paraphrase of Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories. He knew Boethius\u2019 trinitarian tracts\n(Opuscula sacra) and possibly the Consolation of\nPhilosophy, since a set of glosses on this work may be in\nEriugena\u2019s hand (although this is disputed). His chief\nauthorities in the Latin Christian Tradition were the works of the\nFathers, chiefly Augustine (especially his De Genesi ad\nlitteram), Ambrose, Hilary of Poitiers, and Jerome. His\noriginality is largely due to the manner in which he assimilated\n(often translating) the Neoplatonic thought of Eastern Christian\nwriters such as the Cappadocians, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa,\nGregory Nazianzus, as well as Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and\nMaximus Confessor. He also was familiar with Rufinus\u2019 Latin\ntranslation of Origen\u2019s On First Principles and was\noften linked with Origen in medieval times. Though he took the view\nthat the authorities of East and West were not in conflict,\nnevertheless he usually expressed a preference for the Eastern Church\nFathers. An especially important authority was Maximus Confessor,\nwhose account of the return of all things Eriugena copiously\nborrowed.\n\nEriugena\u2019s exceptional learning would be sufficient to\ndistinguish him from contemporary Carolingian scholars, such as Alcuin\nand Sedulius Scottus; but his true and lasting genius lay in his\nability to combine elements from these auctores into a new\ncosmological framework which is rationally argued to the highest\ndegree. Eriugena enthusiastically incorporated many Greek Christian\ntheological concepts: God, the One, creates by self-emanation;\ncreation is a timeless, and hence on-going and always contemporary,\nevent; human nature is originally a Platonic Idea in the mind of God;\nhuman nature is a certain intellectual concept formed eternally in the\nmind of God, Periphyseon, IV.768b). Humans fail to understand\ntheir true nature as image of God in God, because they are distracted\nby created, fleeting temporal \u201cappearances\u201d\n(phantasiai), which entrap the intellect in the clouded\nspatio-temporal realm of sense. However, through intellectual\ncontemplation (theoria, intellectus) and divine illumination\n(which is the receiving of a divine self-manifestation,\ntheophania), humans may achieve unification\n(henosis) with God, and the select few will even undergo\n\u201cdeification\u201d (deificatio, theosis) which\nEriugena interprets as complete identity with God.\n\nIn his discussion of this cosmological saga, Eriugena always appeals\nto dialectic and the order of reasons in order to mediate between the\nvarious sources. For Eriugena, true philosophy is vera ratio\nand indeed, all appeal to authority is nothing other than an appeal to\nright reason (Periphyseon, I.511b). Vera ratio\nunderlies both the cosmos and reason. Eriugena is therefore a strongly\nrationalistic (in the Medieval sense of the word) philosopher,\nattempting to make sense of divine revelation in scripture and nature\nin terms consistent with the evidence of reason based on the rules of\nDialectic. Dialectic, moreover, is not just about the organization of\nwords and thoughts but also describes the structure of reality itself.\nThus, in the Periphyseon IV.781c\u2013d, he makes the bold\nclaim that one need only introduce the \u201copinions of the holy\nFathers\u201d where \n\n\nthe gravest necessity requires that human reason be supported for the\nsake of those who, being untrained in it, are more amenable to\nauthority than reason.\n\n\nThe encounter with the Greek fathers and especially with Maximus\nConfessor has proven crucial for Eriugena\u2019s own thinking but\nalso for the development of intellectual history in Western Europe;\nEriugena was not only a translator or synthesizer but someone who\nappropriates creatively and constructively. The only other comparable\nprecedent is Anicius Boethius\u2019  grand project of translating the\ncorpus of Aristotle and of Plato; the only difference is that Eriugena\nactually carries out his translation project from the Greek: besides the Corpus\nDionysiacum, he translates Gregory of Nyssa\u2019s De\nOpificio Hominis (which he calls De Imagine) and parts,\nif not the entire, homilies on the Hexaemeron of Basil the\nGreat; above all, Eriugena translates a great part of the Maximian\ncorpus: the entire Questiones ad Thalassium and great parts\nof the Ambigua ad Iohannem.\n\nThese translations and the ideas about creation and nature,\nanthropology, philosophy and theology encountered in Eriugena\u2019s\nwritings will constitute an important undercurrent which will inform\nand influence many thinkers in Western thought (see below\n Section 4 on Influence).\n",
