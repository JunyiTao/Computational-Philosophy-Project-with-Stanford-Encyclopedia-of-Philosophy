    "main_text": "Varieties of Physicalism || A Priori and A Posteriori Physicalism\n3.2 A Priori and A Posteriori Physicalism\n\nWe have been assuming that supervenience is necessary for physicalism,\neven if it is not sufficient. But what follows from supervenience? One\nthing that is usually thought to follow is that the physical truths of\nthe world entail all the truths; hence physicalism is true at\nall (12) is true\n\n(12)\n The physical truths entail all the truths.\n\n\nNow suppose that S is a statement which specifies the\nphysical nature of the actual world and S* is a statement\nwhich specifies the total nature of the world. (It might be that\nneither S nor S* are expressible in languages we can\nunderstand, but let us set this aside.) Then physicalism tells us in\naddition that that: \n\n(13)\n S entails S*\n\n\nAnother way to say this is to say that if supervenience physicalism is\ntrue, the following conditional is necessarily true: \n\n(14)\n If S then S*\n\n\nIndeed, this is a general feature of supervenience physicalism: if it\nis true then there will always be a necessary truth of the form of\n(14). \n\nNow, if (14) is necessary the question arises whether it is a\npriori, i.e. knowable independent of empirical experience, or\nwhether it is a posteriori, i.e. knowable but not\nindependently of empirical experience. Traditionally, every statement\nthat was necessary was assumed to be a priori. However, since\nKripke\u2019s Naming and Necessity (1980), philosophers have\nbecome used to the idea that there are truths which are both necessary\nand a posteriori. Accordingly many recent philosophers have\ndefended a posteriori physicalism: the claim that statements\nsuch as (14) are necessary and a posteriori (cf. Loar 1997).\nMoreover, they have used this point to try to disarm many objections\nto physicalism, including those concerning qualia and intentionality\nthat we will consider below. Moreover, as we have just noted, some\nphilosophers have suggested that the necessary a posteriori\nprovides the proper interpretation of non-reductive physicalism.\n\nThe appeal to the necessary a posteriori is on the surface an\nattractive one, but it is also controversial. One problem arises from\nthe fact that Kripke\u2019s idea that there are necessary and a\nposteriori truths can be interpreted in two rather different\nways. On the first interpretation \u2014 I will call it the\nderivation view \u2014 while there are necessary a\nposteriori truths, these truths can be derived a priori\nfrom truths which are a posteriori and contingent. On the\nsecond interpretation \u2014 I will call it the non-derivation view\n\u2014 there are non-derived necessary a posteriori\ntruths, i.e. necessary truths which are not derived from any\ncontingent truths (or any a priori truths for that matter).\nThe problem is that when one combines the derivation view with the\nclaim that (14) is necessary and a posteriori, one encounters\na contradiction. If the derivation view is correct, then there is some\ncontingent and a posteriori statement S# that\nlogically entails (14). However, if S# logically entails (14)\nthen (since \u2018If C, then if A then\nB\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018If C &\nA, then B\u2019) we can infer that the following is\nboth necessary and a priori:\n\n(15)\n If S & S# then S*.\n\n\nOne the other hand, if physicalism is true, and S summarizes\nthe total nature of the world then\nS# is already implicitly included in S. In other\nwords, (15) is simply an expansion\nof (14). But if (15) is just an expansion of (14), then if (15) is\na priori, (14) must also be a priori. But that means\nour initial assumption is false: (14) is not a necessary a\nposteriori truth after all (see Jackson 1998). \n\nHow might an a posteriori physicalist respond to this\nobjection? The obvious response is to reject the derivation view of\nthe necessary a posteriori in favor of the non-derivation\nview. But this is just to say that if one wants to defend a\nposteriori physicalism, one will have to defend the\nnon-derivation view of the necessary a posteriori. However,\nthe non-derivation view is controversial, so it is not something that\nwe can hope to solve here.
