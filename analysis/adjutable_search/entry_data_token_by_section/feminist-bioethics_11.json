    "main_text": "Feminist Contributions to Bioethics Theory || Ethic of care/care ethics\n4.1 Ethic of care/care ethics\n\nThe idea that care could form the basis of a distinct approach to\nethical theory took shape after the publication of psychologist Carol\nGilligan\u2019s now-famous work on gender-based differences in moral\nevaluation, In a Different Voice (1982). Drawing on empirical\ndata Gilligan attempted to show that patterns of moral reasoning that\nprioritize care practices, chosen and unchosen relationships, and the\nacknowledgment of mutual responsibilities are more characteristic of\nwomen, while alternative modes focusing on justice, rights, and the\nelaboration of overarching moral principles are more likely to be used\nby men. Subsequent commentators, including some feminist bioethics,\nhave been highly critical of Gilligan\u2019s conclusions. Some, for\nexample, have complained about her own use of stereotypical gendered\nnorms in her work. Others are skeptical of the supposedly rigidly\ngendered distribution of care versus justice-based ethics,\nsuggesting that the difference is linked not to gender per se but to\nthe experience of being socially and politically marginalized, and\ntherefore more likely to turn to the relational networks of community\nfor support than to institutional justice-based systems (see, e.g.,\nCortese 1990). Other areas of continuing debate are whether the ethic\nof care counts as a form of virtue ethics, or whether conversely it\nonly appears so because it cannot be neatly slotted within the\ntraditional taxonomies of ethical theory (Halwani 2003; Groenhout\n2014; Sander-Staudt 2006).\n\nNevertheless, the basic idea of the importance of care has given rise\nto an extraordinarily rich body of work within feminist thought (Held\n2006; Gary 2022) and has had considerable influence beyond. By\ndifferentiating between various understandings of care and by paying\nattention to the moral subtleties of relational bonds, the ethics of\ncare exposes problems and suggests approaches that are overlooked by\njustice-oriented frameworks. Unsurprisingly, the ethics of care has\nproven to be especially appealing in biomedicine and public health,\nfields where the notion of \u201ccaring for\u201d is central\n(although often unexamined). In many ways, however, the value of the\nethic of care lies less in the centrality of care as a practice than\nin its ability to challenge the conventional understanding that\ndependence relationships are restricted to specific circumstances\n(such as infancy or illness) rather than something in which all of us\nare embedded at all points of our lives. In particular, care ethicists\nhighlight the fact that relationships involving care are often\nunchosen and always unbalanced. Moreover, by reframing care as\ndependency work, ethicists such as Kittay (1999) and Kittay and Feder\n(2003) demonstrate the ubiquity of dependency in the form of dependent\ninteractions in communities that do not involve obvious care\npractices. Positioning unbalanced relations as the norm rather than\nthe exception contrasts starkly with the view of ethical theories in\nwhich normal social and moral life consists mainly of reciprocal,\nnegotiated relationships between equals and dependence is invariably\nundesirable if not outright pathological.\n\nA longstanding criticism of the ethic of care is its potential naivety\nabout those care relationships that are themselves exploitative or\nunjust. Further, it has been attacked for lacking a robust political\nperspective that can adequately account for and unsettle larger-scale\npatterns of domination and oppression affecting women. In response,\nsome authors have visibly extended the ethic of care\u2019s reach to\ninclude structural, systemic, and global issues (Carse & Lindemann\nNelson 1996; Ruddick 1989; Noddings 2002; Held 2006). Joan\nTronto\u2019s Moral Boundaries: A Political Argument for an Ethic\nof Care (1993) was an early attempt to craft a political theory\nintegrating the practice of care into the organization of life in a\ndemocratic and pluralistic society, as was the anthology\nSocializing Care edited by Hamington and Miller (2006).\n\nOthers have teased out the connections between care and associated\nmoral concepts such as dependence, agency, and autonomy. An example is\na growing body of recent work on vulnerability as a useful moral\nconcept (Hurst 2008; Mackenzie, Rogers, & Dodds 2014; Luna 2014,\n2019; Miller 2020). The terminology of \u201cvulnerable\ngroups\u201d, to denote people who are collectively more likely to\nsuffer disadvantage, harm, or exploitation in research or other\ncontexts, is key to many aspects of research ethics especially\ninformed consent, and increasingly appears in public health ethics\ntoo. However, this use of vulnerability tends not to examine the\nforces that lead to the existence of vulnerable groups in the first\nplace. By contrast, feminist authors pay close attention to the way\nthat social and political circumstances can generate or exacerbate\nvulnerabilities. One example is provided by the intrinsic biological\nvulnerability of extreme old age: the extent to which it is\nexperienced as problematic is heavily influenced by other factors such\nas poverty, lack of secure housing and healthcare, and social\nisolation. Furthermore, a population\u2019s vulnerability to famine\nmay be the result of climate change (Macklin 2012; Reiheld 2016).\n",
