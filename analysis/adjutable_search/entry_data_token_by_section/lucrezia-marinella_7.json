    "main_text": "The evidence from bodies that the sexes have different natures || Beauty\n6. Methods and issues of interpretation\n\nMarinella demonstrated extraordinary scholarship by the standards of\nher day, particularly with respect to the variety of sources she was\nable to cite, and with greater accuracy than many of her\ncontemporaries. Many defenders of women had contented themselves with\nresponding to vaguely defined opponents; Marinella, by contrast, cited\nher authors and their texts with some precision. This indicates both\nthat she had access to the texts themselves, and not only to reports\non the texts, and also that she understood the scholarly force of\naccurately and precisely representing the claims of an author. This is\none aspect of her methodology that serves as a strength, and singles\nher out from the crowd of pro-woman writers (see Ross 2009, 289). Her\nextensive use of citation served not only to exhibit those claims with\nwhich she was to take issue, but also to allow her to interpret for\nher own purposes the claims of authors with whom she disagreed. She\noften cites the same author both as an authority in support of her\narguments, and as a target against whom she argues\u2014and the\neffect of this is to undermine the authority of that source.\n\nMarinella was then engaged in establishing the unreliability of the\nvery authorities whose work was supposed to support the inferiority of\nwomen. If Aristotle did not maintain a coherent account of the\nrelation between temperature and rational capacity, we should not\ntrust his assessment of the relative merits of men and women. \n\n\nWhat is unusual about Marinelli\u2019s historicism is that it\nundermines an important and representative authority for\npatriarchy, and consequently links historicism to feminism.\nShe denies the whole category of the authoritative with its implied\nopposition, the category of the specious, and substitutes her own\nconcept of the author\u2014one whose claim to the truth is no more\nthan contingent. (Jordan 1990, 258) \n\n\nMarinella\u2019s methodical use of oppositions in the work of a\nsingle author, the most powerful case being that of Aristotle, leaves\nroom for her to suggest that experience may be a better source of our\nknowledge of women, their capacities and natures.\n\nIf one effect of Marinella\u2019s marshalling of the evidence for\nboth sides of the woman question is to undermine the authority of\nthose authors most frequently cited by her opponents, another effect\nis to raise the possibility of a skeptical agenda. Like many pro-woman\nauthors, Marinella begins by accepting the claim that the rational\nsouls of men and women are the same, before going on to argue for the\nsuperiority of women. We might wonder why she, and others, were not\ncontent to rest with the claim of equality at the level of the\nrational soul. To put the question another way: Did Marinella truly\nbelieve that women are better than men, or did she argue for that\nposition for other reasons? It is possible that the arguments for\nsuperiority are intended to raise skeptical doubts in the minds of her\naudience, doubts which would make them reluctant to decide the\nquestion of superiority between men and women. If it seemed\npreposterous to argue that women were superior to men, and yet one\ncould do so using unimpeachable authorities, then arguments for the\nsuperiority of men over women, constructed on the foundations of those\nsame authorities, might seem less convincing. So, although many\ncontemporary and later interpreters assume that The Nobility\nis a treatise in support of the superiority of women, there is some\nevidence to suggest that Marinella may have argued for the claim of\nsuperiority not so much to establish its truth as to call into\nskeptical doubt the truth of the claim of superiority for men made by\nher opponents (see O\u2019Neill 2007 for an argument that skepticism\ninformed the work of another sixteenth century feminist, Marie de\nGournay).\n\nSome evidence that Marinella\u2019s methods are not entirely\ntransparent lies in her late work, Essortationi alle donne\n(Exhortations to women), which on the surface appears to be a\npalinode, a rejection of a lifetime dedicated to study and\nwriting\u2014she specifically urges women not to aspire to a literary\ncareer. Some interpreters have, however, detected in this work\n\u201ca residue of defiance combined with the possibility of\nunmasking male techniques of domination,\u201d (Kolsky 2001, 984).\nSeveral kinds of evidence point to the possibility that Marinella did\nnot intend to subvert the claims of The Nobility: her use of\n\u201cirony, paradox and contradiction,\u201d together with a\nprefatory remark instructing readers to look below the surface of the\ntext, and the reputation of the printer of the Essortationi\nas one who was infamous for publishing \u201clayered\ndiscourses\u201d (Ross 2009, 296\u20138; Malpezzi Price and Ristaino\n2008, 120\u201355).\n",
