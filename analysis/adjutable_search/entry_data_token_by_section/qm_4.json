Structures on Hilbert Space\n\n\nI remarked above that in the same way that all the information we have\nabout the relations between locations in a city is embodied in the\nspatial relations between the points on a map which represent them, all\nof the information that we have about the internal relations among (and\nbetween) states and quantities in quantum mechanics is embodied in the\nmathematical relations among the vectors and operators which represent\n them.[10]\n From a mathematical point of view, what\nreally distinguishes quantum mechanics from its classical predecessors\nis that states and quantities have a richer structure; they form\nfamilies with a more interesting network of relations among their\nmembers. \n\n\nAll of the physically consequential features of the behaviors of\nquantum mechanical systems are consequences of mathematical properties\nof those relations, and the most important of them are easily\nsummarized:\n\n(P1)\nAny way of adding vectors in a Hilbert space or\nmultiplying them by scalars will yield a vector that is also in the\nspace. In the case that the vector is normalized, it will, from (3.1),\nrepresent a possible state of the system, and in the event that it is\nthe sum of a pair of eigenvectors of an observable \\(B\\) with distinct\neigenvalues, it will not itself be an eigenvector of \\(B\\), but will be\nassociated, from (3.4b), with a set of probabilities for showing one or\nanother result in \\(B\\)-measurements.\n(P2)\nFor any Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space, there are\nothers, on the same space, with which it doesn\u2019t share a full set of\neigenvectors; indeed, it is easy to show that there are other such\noperators with which it has no eigenvectors in common.\n\n\n\nIf we make a couple of additional interpretive assumptions, we can say\nmore. Assume, for instance, that \n\n(4.1)\nEvery Hermitian operator on the Hilbert space\nassociated with a system represents a distinct observable, and (hence)\nevery normalized vector, a distinct state, and\n(4.2)\nA system has a value for observable \\(A\\) if, and only if, the\nvector representing its state is an eigenstate of the \\(A\\)-operator. The\nvalue it has, in such a case, is just the eigenvalue associated with\nthat\n eigenstate.[11]\n\n\n\nIt follows from (P2), by (3.1), that no quantum mechanical state is an\neigenstate of all observables (and indeed that there are observables\nwhich have no eigenstates in common), and so, by (3.2), that\nno quantum mechanical system ever has simultaneous values for all of\nthe quantities pertaining to it (and indeed that there are pairs of\nquantities to which no state assigns simultaneous values). \n\n\nThere are Hermitian operators on the tensor product\n\\(H_1 \\otimes H_2\\) of a pair of Hilbert spaces\n\\(H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\) ... In the event that \\(H_1\\) and\n\\(H_2\\) are the state spaces of systems \\(S1\\) and \\(S2\\),\n\\(H_1 \\otimes H_2\\) is the state-space of the complex\nsystem \\((S1+S2)\\). It follows from this by (4.1) that there are\nobservables pertaining to \\((S1+S2)\\) whose values are not determined by\nthe values of observables pertaining to the two individually.\n\n\nThese are all straightforward consequences of taking vectors and\noperators in Hilbert space to represent, respectively, states and\nobservables, and applying Born\u2019s Rule (and later (4.1) and (4.2)), to\ngive empirical meaning to state assignments. That much is perfectly\nwell understood; the real difficulty in understanding quantum mechanics\nlies in coming to grips with their implications \u2014 physical,\nmetaphysical, and epistemological.\n\nAnyone trying to come to an understanding about what quantum mechanics\nsays about the world has to grapple with one remaining fact. This\nproblem is not an issue with Hilbert spaces, but of the dynamics\n\u2013 the rules that describe the trajectories that systems follow\nthrough the space. From a physical point of view, it is far more\nworrisome than anything discussed to this point. It not only presents\ndifficulties to someone trying to provide an interpretation\nof the theory, but also seems to point to a logical inconsistency in\nthe theory\u2019s foundations.\n\n\nSuppose that we have a system \\(S\\) and a device \\(S^*\\) which measures an\nobservable \\(A\\) on \\(S\\) with values \\(\\{a_1,\na_2, a_3, ...\\}\\). Then there is some\nstate of \\(S^*\\) (the \u2018ground state\u2019), and some observable \\(B\\)\nwith values \\(\\{b_1, b_2,\nb_3, ...\\}\\) pertaining to \\(S^*\\) (its \u2018pointer\nobservable\u2019, so called because it is whatever plays the role of\nthe pointer on a dial on the front of a schematic measuring instrument\nin registering the result of the experiment), which are such that, if\n\\(S^*\\) is started in its ground state and interacts in an appropriate way\nwith \\(S\\), and if the value of \\(A\\) immediately before the interaction is\n\\(a_1\\), then \\(B\\)\u2019s value immediately thereafter is\n\\(b_1\\). If, however, \\(A\\)\u2019s value immediately before the\ninteraction is \\(a_2\\), then \\(B\\)\u2019s value afterwards is\n\\(b_2\\); if the value of \\(A\\) immediately before the\ninteraction is \\(a_3\\), then \\(B\\)\u2019s value immediately after\nis \\(b_3\\), and so on. That is just what it\nmeans to say that \\(S^*\\) measures \\(A\\). So, if we represent the\njoint, partial state of \\(S\\) and \\(S^*\\) (just the part of it which specifies\nthe value of [\\(A\\) on \\(S\\) & \\(B\\) on \\(S^*\\)], the observable whose values\ncorrespond to joint assignments of values to the measured observable on\n\\(S\\) and the pointer observable on \\(S^*\\)) by the vector\n\\(\\ket{A=a_i}_s \\ket{B=b_i}_{s^*}\\), and let \u201c\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u201d\nstand in for the dynamical description of the interaction between\nthe two, to say that \\(S^*\\) is a measuring instrument for \\(A\\) is to say\nthat the dynamical laws entail that,\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\ket{A=a_1}_s \\ket{B=\\text{ground state}}_{s^*} &\\rightarrow \\ket{A=a_1}_s \\ket{B=b_1}_{s^*} \\\\\n\\ket{A=a_2}_s \\ket{B=\\text{ground state}}_{s^*} &\\rightarrow \\ket{A=a_2}_s \\ket{B=b_2}_{s^*} \\\\\n\\ket{A=a_3}_s \\ket{B=\\text{ground state}}_{s^*} &\\rightarrow \\ket{A=a_3}_s \\ket{B=b_3}_{s^*}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nand so on.[12]\n\n\nIntuitively, \\(S^*\\) is a measuring instrument for an observable \\(A\\) just in\ncase there is some observable feature of \\(S^*\\) (it doesn\u2019t matter what,\njust something whose values can be ascertained by looking at the\ndevice), which is correlated with the \\(A\\)-values of systems fed into it\nin such a way that we can read those values off of \\(S^*\\)\u2019s observable\nstate after the interaction. In philosophical parlance, \\(S^*\\) is a\nmeasuring instrument for \\(A\\) just in case there is some observable\nfeature of \\(S^*\\) which tracks or indicates the \\(A\\)-values\nof systems with which it interacts in an appropriate way. \n\n\nNow, it follows from (3.1), above, that there are states of \\(S\\) (too\nmany to count) which are not eigenstates of \\(A\\), and if we consider what\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation tells us about the joint evolution of \\(S\\) and\n\\(S^*\\) when \\(S\\) is started out in one of these, we find that the state of the\npair after interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of [\\(A\\) on \\(S\\)\n& \\(B\\) on \\(S^*\\)]. It doesn\u2019t matter what observable on \\(S\\) is being\nmeasured, and it doesn\u2019t matter what particular superposition \\(S\\) starts\nout in; when it is fed into a measuring instrument for that observable,\nif the interaction is correctly described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\nequation, it follows just from the linearity of the \\(U\\) in that equation,\nthe operator that effects the transformation from the earlier to the\nlater state of the pair, that the joint state of \\(S\\) and the apparatus\nafter the interaction is a superposition of eigenstates of this\nobservable on the joint system.\n\n\nSuppose, for example, that we start \\(S^*\\) in its ground state, and \\(S\\) in\nthe state\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A = a_1}_s + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A=a_2}_s\n\\]\n\nIt is a consequence of the rules for obtaining the state-space of the\ncomposite system that the combined state of the pair is \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A=a_1}_s \\ket{B=\\text{ground state}}_{s^*} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A = a_2}_s \\ket{B = \\text{ground state}}_{s^*}\n\\]\n\nand it follows from the fact that \\(S^*\\) is a measuring instrument for \\(A\\),\nand the linearity of \\(U\\) that their combined state after\ninteraction, is \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A=a_1}_s \\ket{B=b_1}_{s^*} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ket{A = a_2}_s \\ket{B = b_2}_{s^*}\n\\]\n\n\n This, however, is inconsistent with the dynamical rule for contexts of\ntype 2, for the dynamical rule for contexts of type 2 (and if there are\nany such contexts, this is one) entails that the state of the\npair after interaction is either \n\n\\[\n\\ket{A=a_1}_s \\ket{B=b_1}_{s^*}\n\\]\n\n\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\ket{A=a_2}_s \\ket{B=b_2}_{s^*}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIndeed, it entails that there is a precise probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) that it\nwill end up in the former, and a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) that it will end up\nin the latter. \n\n\nWe can try to restore logical consistency by giving up the dynamical\nrule for contexts of type 2 (or, what amounts to the same thing, by\ndenying that there are any such contexts), but then we have\nthe problem of consistency with experience. For it was no mere blunder\nthat that rule was included in the theory; we know what a\nsystem looks like when it is in an eigenstate of a given observable,\nand we know from looking that the measuring apparatus after\nmeasurement is in an eigenstate of the pointer observable. And so we\nknow from the outset that if a theory tells us something else\nabout the post-measurement states of measuring apparatuses, whatever\nthat something else is, it is wrong.\n\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the Measurement Problem in quantum\nmechanics; any interpretation of the theory, any detailed story about\nwhat the world is like according to quantum mechanics, and in\nparticular those bits of the world in which measurements are going on,\nhas to grapple with it.\nLoose Ends\nMixed states are weighted sums of pure states, and\nthey can be used to represent the states of ensembles whose components\nare in different pure states, or states of individual systems about\nwhich we have only partial knowledge. In the first case, the weight\nattached to a given pure state reflects the size of the component of\nthe ensemble which is in that state (and hence the objective\nprobability that an arbitrary member of the ensemble is); in the second\ncase, they reflect the epistemic probability that the system in\nquestion to which the state is assigned is in that state.\n\n\n\nIf we don\u2019t want to lose the distinction between pure and mixed\nstates, we need a way of representing the weighted sum of a set of pure\nstates (equivalently, of the probability functions associated with\nthem) that is different from adding the (suitably weighted) vectors\nthat represent them, and that means that we need either an alternative\nway of representing mixed states, or a uniform way of representing both\npure and mixed states that preserves the distinction between them.\nThere is a kind of operator in Hilbert spaces, called a density\noperator, that serves well in the latter capacity, and it\nturns out not to be hard to restate everything that has been said about\nstate vectors in terms of density operators. So, even though it is\ncommon to speak as though pure states are represented by vectors, the\nofficial rule is that states \u2013 pure and mixed, alike \u2013 are\nrepresented in quantum mechanics by density operators.\n\n\nAlthough mixed states can, as I said, be used to represent\nour ignorance of the states of systems that are actually in one or\nanother pure state, and although this has seemed to many to be an\nadequate way of interpreting mixtures in classical contexts, there are\nserious obstacles to applying it generally to quantum mechanical\nmixtures. These are left for detailed discussion in the other entries\non quantum mechanics in the Encyclopedia.\n\n\nEverything that has been said about observables, strictly speaking,\napplies only to the case in which the values of the observable form a\ndiscrete set; the mathematical niceties that are needed to generalize\nit to the case of continuous observables are\ncomplicated, and raise problems of a more technical nature. These, too,\nare best left for detailed discussion.\n\n\nThis should be all the initial preparation one needs to\napproach the philosophical discussion of quantum mechanics,\nbut it is only a first step. The more one learns about the\nrelationships among and between vectors and operators in Hilbert space,\nabout how the spaces of simple systems relate to those of complex ones,\nand about the equation which describes how state-vectors move through\nthe space, the better will be one\u2019s appreciation of both the nature and\nthe difficulty of the problems associated with the theory. The funny\nbackwards thing about quantum mechanics, the thing that makes it\nendlessly absorbing to a philosopher, is that the more one learns, the\nharder the problems get.\n",
