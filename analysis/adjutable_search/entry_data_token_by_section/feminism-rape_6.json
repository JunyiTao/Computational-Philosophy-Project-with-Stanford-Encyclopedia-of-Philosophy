    "main_text": "The Wrongs and Harms of Rape\n3. The Wrongs and Harms of Rape\n\nAny legal definition of \u2018rape\u2019 implies some correlative\nidea of what is morally wrong with rape: its illegitimate use of\nforce, its disregard of the victim\u2019s nonconsent, and so on.\nFeminist theorists have often sought to articulate a more richly\ntextured sense of rape\u2019s wrongness, and of its distinctive\nharms, than the law alone can provide. They have thus developed a\nnumber of interpretive frames\u2014ideas about what rape is most\nclosely akin to, and/or a form of\u2014for understanding rape\u2019s\nwrongs and harms. No doubt both the wrong and the harm of rape are\ncomplex and multifarious; these interpretive frames suggest emphases\nthat may be illuminating in different contexts and for different\npurposes.\n",
