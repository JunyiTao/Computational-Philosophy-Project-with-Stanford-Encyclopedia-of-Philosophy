    "main_text": "Objections to Pacifism and Possible Replies || Pacifism is for Cowards, Free Riders, Traitors, and Other Vicious Persons\n6.1 Pacifism is for Cowards, Free Riders, Traitors, and Other Vicious Persons\n\nObjection: This objection holds that the reason\npacifists advocate nonviolence is that they are afraid of suffering\nfrom violence; or that they are too lazy or self-interested to take up\narms to fight. This objection focuses on the motivation and psychology\nof pacifists and accuses pacifists of the vice of cowardice. Moreover,\nsuch an objection may also argue that pacifists are egoists who are\ntoo selfish to do what is required to serve justice, protect the\ninnocent, and defend the nation. The free rider objection adds that\npacifists benefit from social goods that are produced through military\npower, while they contribute nothing substantial to the production of\nthese goods. This objection thus claims that pacifism is unjust since\npacifists share in social benefits, without also taking up the burdens\nand obligations that are tied to these benefits. Related to this is\nthe charge that pacifism is unpatriotic and even treasonous. The\nconcern here is that if pacifists are unwilling to fight to defend the\nnation, then they effectively betray the nation and help the enemy. As\nJan Narveson once put this, pacifists have \u201ctoo many\nfriends\u201d (Narveson 2003; also Narveson 2017) since they are\nunwilling to take up arms against their enemies. A more forceful ad\nhominem argument against pacifism can be found in Ward\nChurchill\u2019s idea that pacifism is a pathology of the privileged,\na point that has been reiterated by Derek Jensen. This objection holds\nthat it is easy for those who are not oppressed to advocate\nnonviolence and indeed, that the powerful can use the ideology of\npacifism as a tool with which to further oppress those who are\nunwilling to take up arms in defense of human rights. This idea can be\ntraced back to ideas found in Marcuse, who argued that the weaker\nparties in social conflict are forced by the stronger party to employ\nnonviolence and thus that resort to nonviolence is both ineffective\nand an admission of weakness.\n\nReply: One way that a pacifist might reply to this\nobjection is to argue that pacifism results from noble motives and not\nvicious ones. To support this reply, pacifists might show examples of\nthe virtuous individuals who have advocated pacifism, while also\nemphasizing the ethical basis on which pacifism is grounded. Indeed,\npacifists can avoid the cowardice objection by stressing that\npacifists are willing to suffer violence even though they refuse to\nparticipate in it. With regard to the free rider problem, a principled\npacifist can argue that her moral principles require that she be a\npacifist and that these principles also require that she work to\ntransform society. Moreover, pacifists can engage in productive social\nendeavors that do not necessitate the use of violence or war. This\nsort of compromise occurs when military states find ways to employ the\ntalents of conscientious objectors. Pacifists who refuse to fight can\nvolunteer their talents and energies in nonviolent activities that\nsupport the common good. With regard to the accusation of treason, a\npacifist might claim that there are higher goods than the state.\nIndeed some pacifists\u2014such as Tolstoy or Hauerwas\u2014are also\nanarchists who claim that Christian faith requires that one overcome\none\u2019s attachment to the state as well as one\u2019s hatred of\nenemies. A similar argument can be made against Churchill\u2019s\n\u201cpacifism as pathology\u201d objection, with principled\npacifists claiming that nonviolence is a moral requirement that\ntranscends class and national ideology. Finally, a consequentialist\npacifist can reply that she is concerned with the long-term interests\nof the community and not with the short-term question of winning a war\nor staging a revolution. While violence may create short term\nbenefits, the long term project of creating a stable peace will\nrequire nonviolent means and projects focused on reconciliation and\nrestorative justice. Contra the Churchill/Jensen objection, pacifists\nwill emphasize the moral and political importance of unifying means\nand end. And, as Jos\u00e9-Antonio Orosco has argued, nonviolent\nactivism can be an effective means of countering oppression (Orosco\n2017).\n",
