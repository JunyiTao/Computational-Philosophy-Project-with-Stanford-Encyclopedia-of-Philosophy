    "main_text": "What is Meant by \u201cMental Simulation\u201d? || Final Worries\n2.4 Final Worries\n\nIn this section, we shall finally consider three worries raised for\nadopting\n RES+REU\n as a definition of \u201cmental simulation of\u201d. If you have\nalready had enough of\n RES+REU,\n please feel free to move straight to\n section 3.\n\nHeal (1994) pointed out a problem with committing ST to a particular\naccount of the cognitive mechanisms that underlie it. Suppose that the\nhuman mind contains two distinct decision-making mechanisms:\nMec1, which takes beliefs and desires as input, and generates\ndecisions as output; and Mec2, which works by following\nexactly the same logical principles as Mec1, but takes\nimagined beliefs and imagined desires as input and generates imagined\ndecisions as output. Consider again Frank\u2019s decision to enter\nCentral Caf\u00e9 and my imagined decision to do so.\nAccording to the two mechanisms hypothesis, Frank desired to drink a\nbeer and believed that he could buy one at Central\nCaf\u00e9, fed these mental states into Mec1, which\ngenerated the decision to enter the caf\u00e9. As for me, I fed the\nimagined desire to drink a beer and the imagined belief that I could\nbuy one at Central Caf\u00e9 into a distinct (type of)\nmechanism, i.e., Mec2, which generated the imagined decision\nto enter Central Caf\u00e9. Here is the question: does my\nimagined decision to enter Central Caf\u00e9 count as a\nmental simulation of Frank\u2019s decision to do so? If your answer\nis \u201cYes, it does\u201d, then\n RES+REU\n is in trouble, since my imagined decision was not generated by\nreusing the same (type of) cognitive mechanism that Frank used to\ngenerate his decision; his decision was generated by Mec1, my\nimagined decision by Mec2. Thus, Heal concludes, a definition\n\u201cmental simulation of\u201d should not contain any commitment\nabout cognitive mechanisms\u2014it should not make any implementation\nclaim\u2014but should be given at a more abstract level of\ndescription.\n\nIn the face of this difficulty, a defender of\n RES+REU\n can say the following. First, she might reject the intuition that, in\nthe two mechanisms scenario, my imagined decision counts as a mental\nsimulation of Frank\u2019s decision. At a minimum, she might say that\nthis scenario does not elicit any robust intuition in one direction or\nthe other: it is not clear whether these two mental states stand in\nthe relation being a mental simulation of. Second, she might\ndownplay the role of intuitions in the construction of a definition\nfor \u201cmental simulation of\u201d and cognate notions. In\nparticular, if she conceives of ST as an empirical theory in cognitive\nscience, she will be happy to discount the evidential value of\nintuitions if countervailing theoretical considerations are\navailable. This, e.g., is Currie and Ravenscroft\u2019s (2002)\nposition, who write that \n\n\nthere are two reasons \u2026 why the Simulation Theorist should\nprefer [a one mechanism hypothesis]: \u2026 first, the postulation\nof two mechanisms is less economical than the postulation of one;\nsecond, \u2026 we have very good reasons to think that\nimagination-based decision making does not operate in isolation from\nthe subject\u2019s real beliefs and desires. \u2026 If imagination\nand belief operate under a system of inferential apartheid\u2014as\nthe two-mechanisms view has it\u2014how could this happen? (Currie\n& Ravenscroft 2002: 67\u201368)\n\n\nA second worry has to do with the fact that\n RES+REU\n appears to be too liberal. Take this case. Yesterday, Angelina had\nthe visual experience of a red apple. On the night of June 15, 1815,\nNapoleon conjured up the visual image of a red apple. Angelina used\nher visual mechanism to see, while Napoleon reused his to imagine. If\nwe add to this that Napoleon\u2019s mental state resembled\nAngelina\u2019s,\n RES+REU\n predicts that Napoleon\u2019s (token) visual image was a mental\nsimulation of Angelina\u2019s (token) visual experience. This might\nstrike one as utterly bizarre. In fact, not only did Napoleon not\nintend to simulate Angelina\u2019s experience: he could\nnot even have intended to do it. After all, Angelina was born\nroughly 150 years after Napoleon\u2019s death. By the same token, it\nis also impossible that Napoleon\u2019s visual image has been\ncaused by Angelina\u2019s visual experience. As a matter of\nfact, the visual image Napoleon had on the night of June 15, 1815 is\nentirely disconnected from the visual experience that\nAngelina had yesterday. Thus, how could the former be a mental\nsimulation of the latter? If you think about it, the problem is even\nworse than this.\n RES+REU\n has it that Napoleon\u2019s visual image of a red apple is a mental\nsimulation of all the visual experiences of a red apple that\nhave obtained in the past, that are currently obtaining, and that will\nobtain in the future. Isn\u2019t that absurd?\n\nAgain, a defender of\n RES+REU\n can give a two-fold answer. First, she can develop an argument that\nthis is not absurd at all. Intuitively, the following principle seems\nto be true:\n\n\n(TYPE): the mental state type visual image of a red apple is\na mental simulation of the mental state type visual experience of\na red apple.\n\n\nIf TYPE is correct, then the following principle has to be true as\nwell:\n\n\n(TOKEN): Any token mental state of the type visual image of a red\napple is a mental simulation of every token mental state of the\ntype visual experience of a red apple.\n\n\nBut TOKEN entails that Napoleon\u2019s (token) visual image of a red\napple is a mental simulation of Angelina\u2019s (token) visual\nexperience of a red apple, which is exactly what\n RES+REU\n predicts. Thus,\n RES+REU\u2019s\n prediction, rather than being absurd, independently follows from\nquite intuitive assumptions. Moreover, even though TOKEN and\n RES+REU\n make the same prediction about the Napoleon-Angelina case, TOKEN is\nnot entailed by\n RES+REU,\n since the latter contains a restriction on how visual images\nhave to be generated. Thus, if one finds TOKEN intuitively acceptable,\nit is hard to see how one can find\n RES+REU\n to be too liberal.\n\nThe second component of the answer echoes one of the answers given to\nHeal: for a Simulation Theorist who conceives of ST as a theory in\ncognitive science, intuitions have a limited value in assessing a\ndefinition of \u201cmental simulation of\u201d. In fact, the main\naim of this definition is not that of capturing folk intuitions, but\nrather that of offering a clear enough picture of the relation of\nmental simulation on the basis of which an adequate theory of\nmindreading can be built. So, if the proposed definition fails, say,\nto help distinguishing ST from TT, or is of limited use in\ntheory-building, or is contradicted by certain important results from\ncognitive science, then one has a good reason to abandon it. On the\ncontrary, it should not be a cause for concern if\n RES+REU\n does not match the folk concept MENTAL SIMULATION OF. The notion\n\u201cmental simulation of\u201d is a term of art\u2014like, say,\nthe notions of I-Language or of Curved Space. These notions\ndo poorly match the folk concepts of language and space, but\nlinguists and physicists do not take this to be a problem. The same\napplies to the notion of mental simulation.\n\nAnd here is the third and final worry.\n RES+REU\n is supposed to be a definition of \u201cmental simulation of\u201d\non the basis of which a theory of mindreading can be built. However,\nneither\n RES+REU\n nor\n PROC\n make any reference to the idea of representing others\u2019 mental\nstates. Thus, how could these definitions help us to construct a\nSimulation Theory of mindreading? The answer is simple: they\nwill help us exactly as a clear definition of\n\u201ccomputation\u201d, which has nothing to do with how the mind\nworks, helped to develop the Computational Theory of Mind (see entry\non\n computational theory of mind).\n\nHere is another way to make the point. ST is made up of two\ndistinct claims: the first is that mental simulation is\npsychologically real, i.e., that there are mental states and processes\nsatisfying\n RES+REU\n and\n PROC.\n The second claim is that mental simulation plays a central role in\nmindreading. Clearly, the second claim cannot be true if the first is\nfalse. However, the second claim can be false even if the first claim\nis true: mental simulation could be psychologically real, but play no\nrole in mindreading at all. Hence, Simulation Theorists have to do\nthree things. First, they have to establish that mental simulation is\npsychologically real. We consider this issue in\n section 3.\n Second, they have to articulate ST as a theory of\nmindreading. That is, they have to spell out in some detail the\ncrucial role that mental simulation is supposed to play in\nrepresenting others\u2019 mental states, and contrast the resulting\ntheory with other accounts of mindreading. We dwell on this in\nsections\n 4\n and\n 5.\n Finally, Simulation Theorists have to provide evidence in support of\ntheir theory of mindreading\u2014that is, they have to give us good\nreasons to believe that mental simulation does play a crucial role in\nrepresenting others\u2019 mental states. We discuss this issue in\n section 6.\n",
