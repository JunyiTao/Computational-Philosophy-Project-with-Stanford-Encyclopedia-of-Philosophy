    "main_text": "Further Issues || Non-ideal Conditions\n8.1 Non-ideal Conditions\n\nThe idea of public reason is often presented as a normative ideal, as\nthe way our moral or political rules ought, ideally, to be\njustified, and also as the way individuals ought, ideally, to\nengage in deliberation and discussion. Rawls, for example, stipulates\nthat his account of public reason \u201cbelongs to a conception of a\nwell-ordered constitutional democratic society\u201d (Rawls 1999b,\n573), by which he means a society where: (a) everyone accepts, and\nknows that others accept, the same conception of justice (or at least\neveryone accepts some member from the family of liberal conceptions);\n(b) the basic structure of society is publicly known to satisfy this\nconception and; (c) citizens have a normally effective sense of\njustice (Rawls 1996, 35).\n\nBut what does public reason entail in non-ideal circumstances, such as\nour own, where arguably none of the three conditions listed above are\nmet (Boettcher 2012, 174\u2013175)? Some proponents of public reason\nencourage us to observe the moral duty of civility in our political\nlife, but if the duty of civility has been designed for ideal\nconditions, it is unclear whether or how it might apply under less\nthan ideal conditions (Donahue 2021; Lister 2017). For example, many\naccounts of public reason include a sincerity principle that directs\nindividuals to only support those principles or rules they sincerely\nbelieve meet the test of public reason (Gaus 1996, 139\u2013140;\nRawls 1996, 241\u2013242; Schwartzman 2011. For an alternative view\nsee Carey 2018). But does this requirement still apply in conditions\nwhere many of those with whom we are debating do not embrace the idea\nof public reason, and may behave only strategically or cynically?\nSimilarly, if we believe our existing political institutions are not\npublicly justifiable or do not meet certain minimal requirements of\njustice, do the requirements of public reason nevertheless apply to\nour political deliberations and discourse, or do those requirements\nonly apply once reasonably just institutions have been secured (Rawls\n1996, 247\u2013252)?\n",
