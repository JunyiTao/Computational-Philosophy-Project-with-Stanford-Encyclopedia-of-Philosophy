    "main_text": "Semantics || Game Semantics\n1.3 Game Semantics\n\n\n\nWe discuss these in turn.\n1.1  Standard Logical Matrices\n\n\nThe most suitable way of defining a system \\(\\bS\\) of\nmany-valued logic is to fix the characteristic logical matrix for its\nlanguage, i.e. to fix:\n\nthe set of truth degrees,\nthe truth degree functions which\ninterpret the propositional connectives,\nthe meaning of the truth degree\nconstants,\nthe semantical interpretation of the quantifiers,\n\n\n\nand additionally,\n\nthe designated truth degrees, which form a subset of the\nset of truth degrees and act as substitutes for the traditional truth\nvalue \u201cverum\u201d,\nand occasionally also anti-designated truth degrees, which\nform a subset of the set of truth degrees and act as substitutes for\nthe traditional truth value \u201cfalsum\u201d.\n\n\n\nA well-formed formula \\(A\\) of a propositional language counts\nas valid under some valuation \\(\\alpha\\) (which maps the set of\npropositional variables into the set of truth degrees) iff it has a\ndesignated truth degree under \\(\\alpha\\). And \\(A\\) is logically\nvalid or a tautology iff it is valid under all\nvaluations.\n\n\nIn the case of a first-order language, such a well-formed formula\n\\(A\\) counts as valid under an interpretation \\(\\alpha\\) of\nthe language iff it has a designated truth degree under this\ninterpretation and all assignments of objects from the universe of\ndiscourse of this interpretation to the object variables. \\(A\\)\ncounts as logically valid iff it is valid under all\ninterpretations.\n\n\nLike in classical logic, such an interpretation has to provide\n\na (non empty) universe of discourse,\nthe meaning of the object constants of\nthe language,\nthe meaning of the predicate letters and the function symbols of the\nlanguage.\n\n\n\nA model of some set \\(\\Sigma\\) of well-formed formulas is a\nvaluation \\(\\alpha\\) or an interpretation \\(\\alpha\\) such that all \\(A\\)\n\u2208 \\(\\Sigma\\) are valid under \\(\\alpha\\) . That \\(\\Sigma\\) entails\n\\(A\\) means that each model of \\(\\Sigma\\) is also a model of\n\\(A\\).\n1.2 Algebraic Semantics\n\n\nThere is a second type of semantics for systems \\(\\bS\\)\nof many-valued logic which is based on a whole characteristic class\n\\(\\bK\\) of (similar) algebraic structures. Each such\nalgebraic structure has to provide all the data which have to be\nprovided by a characteristic logical matrix for the language of\n\\(\\bS\\).\n\n\nThe notion of validity of a formula \\(A\\) with respect to an\nalgebraic structure from \\(\\bK\\) is defined as if this\nstructure would form a logical matrix. And logical validity\nhere means validity for all structures from the class\n\\(\\bK\\).\n\n\nThe type of algebraic structures which form such a characteristic\nclass \\(\\bK\\) for some system \\(\\bS\\) of MVL\nusually may come from two different sources. A first source may be\ndetermined by extralogical considerations which distinguish some such\nclass of algebraic structures. If a system \\(\\bS\\) of MVL\nis, however, determined syntactically or by a single characteristic\nmatrix, such a class of algebraic structures often is determined by the\n(syntactical or semantical) Lindenbaum algebra of \\(\\bS\\),\nand in such a case often plays also a crucial role within an algebraic\ncompleteness proof. The algebraic structures in \\(\\bK\\) have\na similar role for \\(\\bS\\) as the Boolean algebras do for\nclassical logic.\n\n\nFor particular systems of MVL one has e.g. the following\ncharacteristic classes of algebraic structures:\n\nfor infinite valued \u0141ukasiewicz logic the class of\nMV-algebras,\nfor infinite valued G\u00f6del logic the class of all\nHeyting algebras which additionally satisfy prelinearity \n\\((x \\rightarrow y) \\cup (y \\rightarrow x) = 1,\\)\nfor Hajek\u2019s basic t-norm logic BL the class of all\nt-algebras, i.e. all those algebraic structures which are formed by the \nreal unit interval together with a left-continuous t-norm \\(T\\) and \ntheir residuation operation \\(I_{T}\\) defined as \n\\(I_{T}(x,y) =  \\sup \\{z\\mid T(x,z) \\le y\\}.\\)\n\n\n\nFor the first two of these examples one has, historically, the logic\ndetermined by a characteristic matrix, and the corresponding class of\nalgebraic structures determined later on. For the third example the\nsituation is different: BL was designed to be the logic of all\ncontinuous t-norms, and from this extralogical approach the class of\nall divisible residuated lattices which satisfy prelinearity was\nfound.\n\n\nFrom a philosophical point of view, however, it usually would be\npreferable to have a semantic foundation for a system of MVL which uses\na single characteristic logical matrix. But, from a formal point of\nview, both approaches are equally important, and the algebraic\nsemantics turns out to be the more general approach.\n1.3 Game Semantics\n\nThere are various ways in which\n logic and games can be related.\n Dialogical logic, e.g.,\n offers a game-theoretic semantics for classical as\nwell as for intuitionistic logic: a formula counts as valid if a\nproponent who states this formula has a winning strategy over possible\nattacks an opponent is allowed to realize.\n\n\nIn the context of the relationship between fuzzy sets and many-valued\nlogic, an approach toward a game-oriented look at logical validity was\noffered by Robin Giles. Starting in 1975, he proposed in a series of\npapers Giles (1975,1976,1979), and again in Giles (1988), a general\ntreatment of reasoning with vague predicates by means of a formal\nsystem based upon a convenient dialogue interpretation. He had already\nused this dialogue interpretation in other papers, such as Giles 1974,\nwhich deals with subjective belief and the foundations of physics. The\nmain idea is to let \u201ca sentence represent a belief by\nexpressing it tangibly in the form of a bet\u201d.  The betting\nconcerns the actual outcomes of dispersive experiments with different\npossible results of known probability. In this setting then a\n\u201csentence \\(\\psi\\) is considered to follow from sentences\n\\(\\phi_{1},\\ldots,\\phi_{n}\\) just when he who accepts\nthe bets \\(\\phi_{1},\\ldots,\\phi_{n}\\) can at the same\ntime bet \\(\\psi\\) without fear of loss\u201d.\n\n\nThe (formal) language obtained in this way is closely related to\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s infinite-valued logic \\(\\rL_{\\infty}\\): in fact\nthe two systems coincide if one assigns to a sentence \\(\\phi\\) the truth\nvalue \\(1-\\langle\\phi\\rangle\\), with \\(\\langle\\phi \\rangle\\) for the risk\nvalue of asserting \\(\\phi\\). And he even adds the remark \u201cthat,\nwith this dialogue interpretation, \u0141ukasiewicz logic is exactly\nappropriate for the formulation of the \u2018fuzzy set theory\u2019\nfirst described by L.A. Zadeh (1965); indeed, it is not too much to\nclaim that \\(\\rL_{\\infty}\\) is related to fuzzy set theory exactly\nas classical logic is related to ordinary set theory\u201d.\n\n\nDifferent versions and generalizations of these dialogue games have\nbeen studied recently. Various aspects of these developments are\ndiscuss, e.g., in Ferm\u00fcller (2008) and Ferm\u00fcller/Roschger\n(2014). Such approaches are not only able to provide game semantics\nfor e.g. G\u00f6del logics and product logic. There are also bridges\nwhich connect such games with the design of sequent calculi for\nmany-valued logics, cf. Ferm\u00fcller/Metcalfe (2009).\n\n\nThere is also a further type of dialogue games related to\n\\(m\\)-valued \u0141ukasiewicz logic: a proponent is asking for\ninformation, and the answering opponent is allowed to lie up to\n\\(m\\) times. Such \u201cUlam games with lies\u201d have been\nintroduced by Mundici (1992).\n",
