    "main_text": "\n\nExchange is fundamental to business. \u2018Business\u2019 can mean\nan activity of exchange. One entity (e.g., a person, a firm)\n\u201cdoes business\u201d with another when it exchanges a good or\nservice for valuable consideration, i.e., a benefit such as money.\n\u2018Business\u2019 can also mean an entity that offers goods and\nservices for exchange, i.e., that sells things. Target is a business.\nBusiness ethics can thus be understood as the study of the ethical\ndimensions of the exchange of goods and services, and of the entities\nthat offer goods and services for exchange. This includes related\nactivities such as the production, distribution, marketing, sale, and\nconsumption of goods and services (cf. Donaldson & Walsh 2015;\nMarcoux 2006b).\n\nQuestions in business ethics are important and relevant to everyone.\nAlmost all of us \u201cdo business\u201d, or engage in a commercial\ntransaction, almost every day. Many of us spend a major portion of our\nlives engaged in, or preparing to engage in, exchange activities, on\nour own or as part of organizations. Business activity shapes the\nworld we live in, sometimes for good and sometimes for ill.\n\nBusiness ethics in its current incarnation is a relatively new field,\ngrowing out of research by moral philosophers in the 1970\u2019s and\n1980\u2019s. But scholars have been thinking about the ethical\ndimensions of commerce at least since the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1750\nBC).\n\nThis entry summarizes research on central questions in business\nethics, including: What sorts of things can be sold? How can they be\nsold? In whose interests should firms be managed? Who should manage\nthem? What do firms owe their workers, and what do workers owe their\nfirms? Should firms try to solve social problems? Is it permissible\nfor them to try to influence political outcomes? Given the vastness of\nthe field, of necessity certain questions are not addressed.\n",
