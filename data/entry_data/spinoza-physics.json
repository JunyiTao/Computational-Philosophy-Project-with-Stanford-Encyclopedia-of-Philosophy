    "preamble": "\n\nSpinoza's thought stands at an uneasy and volatile period in the\ndevelopment of physical theory. His physical science is largely\nCartesian, both in content and rationalistic method. It is harshly\ndismissive of the \u201coccult qualities, intentional species,\nsubstantial forms, and a thousand other trifles\u201d (letter 60, to\nBoxel) of pre-revolutionary scholastic natural philosophy. It is\nlikewise antagonistic to the new Baconian experimentalism, holding\nthat empirical findings can at best present examples of what reason\nitself demonstrates.   Spinoza neither perceives the\nparticular difficulties for Cartesian physical theory that lead\nLeibniz to revive both finalism and substantial forms, nor foresees\nthe Newtonian theory of universal gravitation whose mathematical and\nempirical superiority to the Cartesian vortex theory lead to its\nuniversal acceptance, despite its own revival of occult powers in the\nform of forces operating at a distance.\n\nYet Spinoza is no orthodox Cartesian. He recognizes a variety of\nshortcomings in Descartes' physical views and moreover rejects much of\nthe metaphysical foundation upon which these views rest. In light of\nthese disagreements, Spinoza holds that bodies are not substances, but\nrather modifications of a single substance, and he develops a\ndistinctive and novel view of their individuation. He must also find\nan alternative basis for the basic principles that underlie and\nexplain the motion and interaction of bodies. The resulting physical\nview arguably contains anticipations of the fundamental character of\nmodern physics, and certainly anticipates modern theory of homeostatic\nsystems. Yet in spite of its express mechanistic and deterministic\ncharacter, Spinoza's physical theory appears to exploit an irreducible\nelement of finalism, and to accord an important explanatory role to\nindividual bodily essences.\n\nThis article first briefly discusses and places in context the textual\nsources most relevant to a consideration of Spinoza's physics. It then\npresent in brief summary those of Spinoza's philosophical views that\nbear most directly on his physical theory. Having identified the\ncentral issues for physical theory that emerge, it then clarifies\nthose issues by examining the sources in more detail. Finally, it\nsituates Spinoza's views vis-\u00e0-vis contemporary\nexperimental and mathematical science.\n\nNote on citation form. Citations to Spinoza's\nEthics give the part in roman capitals, then the proposition,\ndefinition, or axiom number, (e.g., p13, or d5)), and then specify\nwhether the cited material is in a scholium (s), corollary (c), or\nlemma (l). Citations to other works are given in the same style,\nexcept that they are prefaced by the abbreviated title of the work, in\nitalics (e.g., \u201cPCP\u2009\u201d for Principles\nof Cartesian Philosophy).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Sources and context\n\nWhile the other two great rationalists, Descartes and Leibniz, were\nphysical theorists and mathematicians of the first rank, who made\nsubstantial contributions to the development of physical science, the\nsame cannot be said of Spinoza. Nor was Spinoza a systematic\nexperimentalist. Indeed, his contributions to the historical\ndevelopment of physical theory are minimal. This is not because the\nphysical theory he presented was rejected or overlooked, but rather\nbecause Spinoza simply never presented a physical theory as such. Most\nof his writing concerning physical theory is instead in the service of\nother ends: exegetical, as an expositor of Descartes' philosophy;\nmetaphysical, in elaborating, for example, the relationships between\nGod or Nature as the single substance and the finite things he treats\nas \u201cmodes\u201d thereof; or psychological, in explaining the\ndistinctive characteristics and possible blessedness of the human mind\nas the idea of an especially complex individual body.\n\nThe main sources of evidence for Spinoza's thought concerning physical\nnature are his Principles of Cartesian Philosophy, the first\nhalf of his magnum opus the Ethics, and a number of important\nletters from his correspondence. The PCP contains by far the\nmost focused and detailed of Spinoza's writing on physics proper, but\nis officially billed as an exposition of Descartes. The first half of\nthe Ethics presents a physical theory only insofar as Spinoza\nfinds this necessary to serve his goals in that work to explicate the\nnature of God and the natures and origins of the human mind and its\naffects. Discussion of the physical in the correspondence, though\noften illuminating, is typically directed at providing either\nclarification or defense of his views in response to queries and\nobjections, or at discussing contemporary views and developments in\nexperimental and theoretical science in order to show that they are\neither mistaken or consistent with his own views.\n2. Overview of the Ethics as it bears on physical theory\n\nThe philosophical view that emerges from the Ethics, in so\nfar as it bears on physical theory, can be outlined as follows. God or\nNature is the unique substance (Ip14), existing essentially (Ip7),\ninfinite in power (Ip8), and characterized by infinite attributes,\neach constituting its essence (Id4). Finite things are but\nmodifications of that substance, and not themselves independent beings\n(Ip14); bodies in particular are modes of substance conceived under\nthe attribute Extension. God or Nature, as the ultimate cause of all\nthings, is also the cause of all the particular modifications of\nextended nature (Ip18). However, substance's power is not expressed\nthrough the operations of will and intellect; the one substance does\nnot act by conceiving a design in the intellect and bringing it to\nexistence through the will (Ip23cl, Appendix, I). Hence Nature is not\na teleological system, natural phenomena do not have purposes, and all\ncausation between modes is efficient, none final. Since things are\nconceived through their causes, and modes are conceived always through\nthe attribute to which they belong, there can be no trans-attribute\ncausation. Bodies and their modifications cannot cause ideas, and\nideas cannot cause modifications of bodies (IIp6). All modes are\nconceived through the substance in which they inhere; in this sense\nGod or nature is an indwelling cause of all things (Ip18). But the\nparticular modifications of Extension are causally necessitated\nentirely by the determining operation of prior modes of the same\nattribute, themselves so determined, ad infinitum (Ip28). The\nphysical domain is thus completely closed causally, impervious to\ninfluence from modes of other attributes and to intervention of divine\nwill, and fully deterministic (Ip29).\n\nThought is another attribute through which substance is conceived\n(IIp1). Since substance is unique, and the attributes simply various\nessences under which it is conceived, the series of finite modal\ncauses in each attribute must operate strictly in parallel with one\nanother (IIp7). For every modification of Thought there is a\nmodification of Extension it mirrors, and vice versa; and the causal\norder of the one is perfectly matched with that of the other. The\nmind, a finite mode of Thought, is, under this parallelism, simply the\nidea of the body to which it corresponds under the parallelism\n(IIp13). The economy of ideas is precisely as closed, necessitated and\ndeterministic as that of bodies.\n\nBodies are individuated one from the other, not by reason of\nsubstance, but rather by reason of motion and rest (IIp13sl1),\nindividual identity through time and change being a matter of the\ndynamic maintenance of a distinctive ratio of motion and rest of a\nbody's parts (IIp13s Def.). The human body is simply a particularly\ncomplex individual body, capable of maintaining its distinctive\nstructure through a wide variety of externally imposed modifications,\nand capable of forming corporeal images of those bodies that affect\nit. An affect that increases the body's ability to maintain its\ndistinctive ratio is paralleled in the mind by a modification that\nincreases that mind's power of thought, and the passage from lesser to\ngreater power is joy (IIIp11s, Affect Def. II). Modifications that\ndecrease the power of a body to maintain its individual ratio are\nparalleled by modifications decreasing the mind's power of thought,\nand such passages are sadness (IIIp11s, Affect Def. III). Further,\nindividuals, both minds and bodies, strive to persevere in their\nexistence as far as they can; that is to say, they strive to increase\nthe power by which they maintain their distinctive natures (IIIp6).\nBodies, then, have essences, which are powers of striving (IIIp7). The\ncausal interactions in which a body participates that are attributable\nto the action of that body increase its power of perseverance; it is\nin contrast passive with respect to those that diminish its power.\nEvidently, for Spinoza, strict necessitarian determinism is consistent\nwith a genuine distinction between action and passion, between doing\nand suffering an act.\n\nSeveral fundamental and distinctive issues of interpretation\npertaining to the physical arise from this picture. How are bodies to\nbe conceived, if not as independent substances? How are motion and\nrest to be conceived so as to make sense of the claim that bodies are\nindividuated by them? How are the principles of inertia and the\ncollision laws that follow from it to be accounted for, given that\nthey cannot be grounded in God's immutable will? What is the nature of\nthe individual striving of bodies, and how can it be reconciled with\nSpinoza's deterministic dynamics of Extension? These issues cannot be\naddressed independently of one another. The present discussion will\napproach them as they emerge from Spinoza's engagement with Cartesian\nphysics, beginning with the PCP\u2018s exposition of\nDescartes\u2019 views.\n3. Physical cartesianism and the consequences of metaphysical divergence\n3.1 Areas of agreement and divergence\n\nSpinoza agrees with the Cartesian conception of body as res\nextensa (Latin, extended thing), i.e., things necessarily and\nexhaustively conceived through\n extension.[1]\n He was, like Descartes, a plenist, rejecting the intelligibility of a\nvacuum. Furthermore, we know from Spinoza's correspondence that he\naccepted nearly all of Descartes' kinematic views, that is, the laws\nhe articulated describing the course of physical phenomena.\nHe likewise agrees with Descartes that physical nature should not be\nconceived as a teleological system, and that appeals to final causes\nshould be banished from physical theory.\n\nYet Spinoza had substantial disagreements with Descartes over a wide\nrange of metaphysical issues that bear on physical theory. Most\nobviously, he rejected Descartes' dualism of extended and mental\nsubstances in favor of substance monism, and correspondingly rejected\nCartesian mind-body interactionism. Some of these metaphysical\ndisagreements penetrate right to the grounds of the physical views the\ntwo thinkers share, revealing much of their agreement to be quite\nsuperficial. Consider, for example, their shared rejection of appeals\nto final causes in physics. Descartes held that final causal or\nteleological thinking is useless in physics, not because physical\nnature is not in fact teleological, but because our finite\nunderstanding cannot hope to understand the divine will, hence cannot\ngrasp the purposes with which physical nature is imbued. For Spinoza,\nin contrast, the problem is not epistemological but metaphysical. The\ndivine cause of the world has no will, and does not create things with\na plan in mind (1p32c, p33d, s2); hence nature is simply not a\nteleological system at all.\n\nSpinoza's agreement with the Cartesian laws of nature and collision\nprovides a telling set of further examples. Spinoza explicated and\nelaborated on these at length and in detail in the PCP.\nInterpreting this work as an expression of Spinoza's own thinking is a\ndelicate matter, since its explicit aim is to present and explicate\nDescartes' views, not Spinoza's own. Despite this, the PCP\nprovides a number of indications of where Spinoza diverges from\nDescartes on the metaphysical foundations of physics. In particular,\nthe demonstrations Spinoza offers of most of the basic principles of\nCartesian physics are often significantly different from or\nsupplementary to Descartes' own, and seem to presage important\nelements of Spinoza's mature thought as expressed in the\nEthics.\n\nOne such supplement involves Spinoza's attempt to extend the range of\napplication of Descartes' collision rules. Descartes' collision rules\nare limited in scope to the special case of bodies moving along a\nsingle line. In a scholium following a corollary Spinoza adds to\nDescartes' third rule, Spinoza explains that the vexed Cartesian term\n\u201cdeterminatio\u201d (determination) signifies not just\nthe direction of a motion, but also a force of motion along that\ndirection (PCP IIp27s). He then attempts to demonstrate how\nthe Cartesian collision laws can be extended to oblique collisions, by\nshowing how this force can be resolved into components by the rule of\nparallelograms. Spinoza's confused attempt fails, but this failure is\nnot of much interest on its own. Given that the oblique case is surely\nmore ordinary than the collinear case, and given that generality of\napplication is something one would surely want in collision laws, what\nis interesting is why Descartes did not himself attempt to provide\nrules of more general coverage, and why Spinoza felt that he had to do\nso.\n\nA plausible answer lies in a difference in their views as to the\ndegree and way in which physical nature forms a closed system.\nDescartes held that quantity of motion, conceived as the product of\nspeed and bulk, is conserved in all physical\n interactions.[2]\n This view allowed him to hold that mental substances can interact\nwith bodies and influence their motions, so long as they influence\nonly their direction. But given such influence, there can be no fully\ngeneral physical laws covering collisions. The precise state of a\nphysical system for Descartes cannot be determined by its prior state\nplus the laws of\n nature.[3]\n In this sense Descartes was not a physical determinist. Given that\nthe possible intrusion of extra-physical influence precludes fully\ngeneral collision laws, Descartes might not have thought it worthwhile\nto puzzle too much over the formulation of laws concerning non-linear\nmotion, thinking it sufficient to illustrate the application of the\nprinciples governing interaction only in the simplest cases.\n\nSpinoza emphatically rejected Cartesian interactionism. For him,\nextended nature is an entirely closed system. All the determinations\nof body, including not just quantity of motion but also direction, are\nwholly accounted for by the causal determination of other bodies,\ncombined with the nature of the body in question. Spinoza makes this\nquite clear in Ip28:\n\nEvery singular thing, or any thing which is finite and has a\ndeterminate existence, can neither exist nor be determined to produce\nan effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an effect by\nanother cause, which is also finite and has a determinate existence\n\u2026 and so on, to infinity.\n\n\nSince modes of distinct attributes cannot cause or explain one\nanother, and since God is the cause of modes only insofar as he is\nconsidered to be affected by another thing under the attribute of\nwhich they are modes (IIp6, IIp9), it follows that every determination\nof an extended thing results from the exclusive determining operations\nof other extended things. In this light, Spinoza should have felt more\nacutely than Descartes the need for a set of collision laws of fully\ngeneral application.\n\nUnbeknownst to him this need could only be met effectively by the\nrejection of Descartes' conservation law. Spinoza nowhere calls this\nlaw explicitly into question, and his acceptance of Descartes'\ncollision laws strongly suggests that he did in fact accept it. But he\ncannot have accepted the metaphysical grounds Descartes offers for it.\nFor Descartes, substances are dependent for their existence at every\nmoment upon God's concurrent creative activity, and since God's will\nis constant, he always recreates the whole of the extended world with\nexactly the same quantity of motion as he put there in the beginning.\nEach and every one of Descartes' laws of motion is for him\nmetaphysically grounded in the immutability of the divine will. But\nSpinoza's God has no will, and the world is not a product of creation,\nin the sense in which creation follows from a decision to act in\naccord with a conception formed in the understanding. Spinoza's own\ncommitment to rationalism nonetheless demands that there be some\nreason for the conservation of motion.\n3.2 The principle of least modal mutation\n\nThis divergence over the possible metaphysical grounds for natural\nlaws and collision rules is important for understanding what is\nfundamentally at stake in another of Spinoza's supplements to what\nDescartes had himself offered in his Principles of\nPhilosophy. In a letter to Clerselier, Descartes makes clear that\nof all of his rules of collision \u201cdepend on only a\nsingle principle, which is that when two bodies collide, and have in\nthem incompatible modes, there must undoubtedly occur some mutation of\nthese modes to make them compatible, but this mutation is always the\nleast possible\u201d (Descartes 1964\u201374: V, 185, emphasis\nadded). Following Gabbey (1996), call this the \u201cPrinciple of\nLeast Modal Mutation\u201d (PLMM). Despite is importance, Descartes\nneither mentions the PLMM is his Principles, nor offers a\njustification for it in the letter to Clerselier or elsewhere.\n\nIn the PCP, Spinoza includes the principle Descartes left\nout, and offers the demonstration Descartes never attempted.\nPCP IIp23 states: \u201cWhen the modes of a body are forced\nto undergo variation, that variation will always be the least that can\nbe.\u201d The demonstration consists of a concise and exclusive\nappeal to PCP IIp14, Spinoza's rendering of Descartes' law of\ninertia, according to which \u201cEach single thing, insofar as it is\nsimple and undivided and is considered only in itself, always\nperseveres in the same state, as far as it can\u201d. But just as\nDescartes never explains why the PLMM is true, Spinoza never explains\nwhy the principle of inertia supports the PLMM. Moreover, as\nformulated in PCP IIp14, it seems prima facie\ninadequate to do so. PCP IIp14 speaks of what happens to a\nbody only as it is considered in itself, simple and\nundivided, whereas PCP IIp23 speaks of bodies undergoing\nvariation imposed by other bodies, and is not limited to simple and\nundivided bodies. And even supposing PCP IIp14 relevant to\nwhat goes on with bodies when considered as affected by other bodies,\nit does not give any obvious guidance as to what then occurs. It seems\non the face of it quite possible that the least total modal variation\ncommanded by PCP IIp23 might involve a greater variation on\nthe part of each of the colliding bodies than would be consistent with\neither body in question persevering in its state as far as it can on\nits own. We are of course told they always remain in the same state\n\u201cas far as they can.\u201d But for this qualification to be of\nany relevance, it will obviously have to mean \u201cas far as they\ncan, in the face of the influence of external bodies\u201d; but until\nwe know the content of the collision laws, we are not entitled to say\nhow the influence of external bodies affects a body's inertial\ntendency. Yet it is just this content we need PCP IIp23 to\nderive.\n\nHow, then, might inertia be understood so that it supports the PLMM?\nIn good rationalist fashion, we should expect to come to a sound\nunderstanding of the principle of inertia by attending to the grounds\nfrom which it follows. But just as in the case of the Cartesian\nconservation law, Spinoza cannot himself have accepted the Cartesian\nstrategy of grounding inertia in the immutability of God's will.\nSpinoza offers his own principle of inertia in the so-called\n\u201cphysical interlude\u201d of the Ethics, at IIp13 L3C:\n\u201ca body in motion moves until it is determined by another body\nto rest; and a body at rest also remains at rest until it is\ndetermined to motion by another\u201d. Rather than appealing to\ndivine will, Spinoza's demonstration of this principle seems to\nproceed from causal rationalism alone.\n\nWhen I suppose, for example that a body A is at rest and I give no\nconsideration to other moving bodies, I can assert nothing about body\nA but that it is at rest. Now if it should thereafter happen that body\nA is in motion, this surely could not have resulted from the fact that\nit was at rest; for from that fact nothing else could have followed\nthan that body A should be at rest.\n\n\nSince nothing in the conception of a thing as moving or at rest,\nwithout regard to other things, could explain a change in its motion\nor rest, something outside that conception is required to do so. This\ndemonstration cites no previous propositions or axioms of the\nEthics; indeed Spinoza claims his principle of inertia is\n\u201cself-evident\u201d.\n\nBut it would be unsatisfying to take inertia as primitive\u2014to say\nthat bodies in fact do tend to persist in their states, though there\nis no reason to be discerned in their nature why they do so. To say\nthis would be to take it that Spinoza accepted the Cartesian principle\nas Descartes understood it, while rejecting the grounds Descartes\noffered for it, and without providing any substitute for it. This is\ndissonant indeed with the general tenor of Spinoza's\n rationalism.[4]\n Moreover, on this view, Spinoza would have taken the trouble to make\nexplicit the PLMM Descartes' rules require, only to justify it by a\ndirect and unelaborated appeal to a groundless principle of inertia,\nwhich seems, on Descartes' understanding of it, quite inadequate to do\nthe job. Yet Spinoza evidently did think that the PLMM followed from\nthe principle of inertia. This suggests that he had a different\nconception than did Descartes of both the nature and ground of that\nprinciple.\n3.3 The principle of inertia and striving\n\nAn intriguing shift in the language Spinoza uses in the PCP\nto articulate the Cartesian laws of motion is suggestive of how\nSpinozistic and Cartesian inertia may differ. In PCP IIp16,\nSpinoza states \u201cevery body which moves in a circle, as for\nexample, a stone in a sling, is continuously determined to go on\nmoving along a tangent.\u201d The immediately succeeding proposition,\nPCP IIp17, states, \u201cEvery body that moves in a circle\nstrives to move away from the center of the circle that it\ndescribes\u201d (emphasis added). Spinoza has substituted\n\u201cstrives\u201d for \u201cis continuously determined to\ndo\u201d, the Latin \u201cconari\u201d for the\n\u201ctendere\u201d of PCP IIp16, which is what\nDescartes had used in expressing his own version of the law of\ncentrifugal motion. This substitution arguably involves a shift in\ndynamical implication. Conari usually has the sense of the\nEnglish \u201cexertion\u201d, \u201ceffort\u201d\n\u201cundertaking\u201d, or \u201cimpulse\u201d; reading\nconari in accord with this usual sense, PCP IIp17\nnot only describes what a body moving circularly will do when it is\nnot compelled by an external cause, but attributes that action to the\neffort or impulse of the moving body. PCP IIp17's invocation\nof conari, if we read it in this active sense, signals an\nongoing effort, a continuous directedness, in this case, at\nhomeostasis.\n\nOne must be quite circumspect in drawing inferences from this\nterminological shift on Spinoza's part. For one thing, the word for\nwhich conari is substituted, tendere, can have\nsimilar connotations itself, carrying the sense of a try or an\nattempt. For another, \u201cconari\u201d is, as Curley\npoints out (Spinoza 1985, p. 280 n. 43), a perfectly good Cartesian\nword, and in Descartes' usage, it is quite clear that\n\u201cconari\u201d is not intended to imply anything really\nactive on the part of the \u201cstriving\u201d body. In\nPrinciples 3.56, Descartes tells us that the striving\n(conari) after some motion of inanimate things \u201cmerely\nmeans that they are positioned and pushed into motion in such a way\nthat they will in fact travel in that direction, unless they are\nprevented by some other cause\u201d. Spinoza faithfully reiterates\nthis passive sense of \u201cstriving\u201d on Descartes' behalf in\nPCP IIId3. On the other hand, \u201cconari\u201d\nis also cognate with a perfectly good Spinozistic word,\n\u201cconatus\u201d, which is his term in the\nEthics for an individual's inherent power of striving to\npersevere in its being (IIp6). Spinoza identifies this power as the\nessence of the individual (IIIp7), and further identifies its increase\nwith the individual's increased power of action, as opposed to\npassion, that is, with an increase in power of self-determination as\nopposed to external determination (IIIp11). This suggests that\n\u201cconari\u201d, as Spinoza intends it, involves\nsomething more than the mere passive tendency the term signifies for\nDescartes. Recalling once again that the inertial tendency of bodies\ndescribed in PCP IIp14 cannot, for Spinoza, be accounted for\nby appeal, in the manner of Descartes, to divine will, the\nsubstitution of \u201cconari\u201d for\n\u201ctendere\u201d in PCP IIp17 may signal the\nfact that Spinoza is all along thinking of inertia as resulting from\nan active principle in bodies as such.\n\nIf Spinoza's principle of inertia is to provide a ground for\nPCP IIp17 taken as involving \u201cconari\u201d in\nan active sense, then it must be taken to amount to the claim not just\nthat bodies will not in fact change their state unless externally\ndetermined to do so, but also that even while external causes are\nacting on a body (e.g., the sling holding the stone in circular\nmotion), the body's own impulse is at work actively endeavoring to\ndetermine it to move as it would in the absence of that external\ncause. And reading Spinozistic inertia this way, imputing to the body\na continuous effort to move so as to maintain the state it\nwould be in absent external determination, also suits it to ground the\nPLMM. Given the symmetry of interaction, each of the bodies to an\ninteraction, being externally determined to change by the other, will\nstrive to resist change as far as it is able. Plausibly, then, the\ntotal change of state resulting from the resolution of the opposition\nof the interacting bodies will be the least total possible. This\nsuggests, at least tentatively, that even in the PCP, Spinoza\nis at work attempting to shore up worries in the foundations of\nCartesian physics that stem from the unduly passive Cartesian\nconstrual of the equation of body with extension.\n\n3.4 Striving and teleology\n\nQuite apart from the question whether Spinoza intended to impose this\nmore active reading of inertial dynamics on Cartesian philosophy,\neither deliberately or unawares, he clearly made the striving conatus\nof individual modes an important centerpiece of the mature philosophy\nhe presented in the Ethics. IIIp6, which articulates the\nconatus doctrine according to which \u201ceach thing, as far as it\ncan by its own power, strives to persevere in its own being\u201d,\nhas been the subject of a great amount of interpretive puzzlement in\nthe literature. A main focus of this puzzlement is the extent to which\nIIIp6 represents a teleological element in Spinoza's natural\nphilosophy. It is certainly central to Spinoza's subsequent treatment\nof human psychology, according to which we strive to obtain those\nthings that increase our power and to avoid those that diminish it.\nSpinoza takes his conatus principle to license inferences from\nsentences of the form \u201cx would increase\nA\u2018s power\u201d to sentences of the form\n\u201cA does x so far as A is able\u201d;\nthis is genuine explanatory teleology, treating a state to be\nachieved\u2014the increase of power\u2014as an end towards which a\nthing's activity is directed, and thus as an explanatory ground for\nbehaviors.\n\nOne ground for reading teleology out of the conatus principle and for\nregarding both teleology and that principle as fundamentally\nirrelevant to Spinoza's physical theory is that the latter's first\nexplicit appearance in part III of the Ethics comes long\nafter Spinoza presents his accounts of extended nature and the basic\nmechanics of modes thereof, indeed in a way that makes it very hard to\nsee how any teleology could be involved at all. Ip28 denies that any\nsingular thing can be determined to exist or to produce an effect\nunless it has been so determined by a prior finite cause, ad\ninfinitum. The use made of Ip28 in IIp9 suggests that Spinoza intends\nIp28 to articulate not just a necessary condition on modal existence\nand determination, but the exclusive means by which finite modes are\nbrought to existence and determined to have any particular effects.\nThis seems to allow no room for action of bodies in their own right,\nno residual space for any contribution to the motions of bodies of the\nactive striving of the moving bodies themselves. Moreover, Spinoza\nexpressly denies that nature is a teleological system, and claims that\nfinal causal/teleological explanations \u201cturns nature completely\nupside down. For what is really a cause it considers as an effect, and\nconversely, what is an effect it considers as a cause\u201d\n(Appendix, I).\n\nIn this light, the problem from the standpoint of the metaphysics of\nExtension \u2014 the basis of physical theory\u2014is to explain why\nthe specific configuration of a given existing mode makes any\ncontribution at all to the determinations that result from the\noperation of external modal causes. It would be rash to read Ip28 in\nsuch a way that the causal powers of a body owe everything to the\ncontributions of extrinsic causes, and nothing to the intrinsic nature\nof the body itself. Spinoza says in IIp13s A1 that \u201call modes by\nwhich a body is affected by another body follow both from the nature\nof the body affected and at the same time the nature of the affecting\nbody, so that \u2026 different bodies may be moved differently by\none and the same body.\u201d (This is a key point in Spinoza's\naccount of corporeal imagination, mental representation and the first\nkind of knowledge, offered at IIp17\u201341.) So the nature of an\naffected body makes a difference to the way it is affected\nextrinsically. This is not surprising. But then what explains why a\nbody's nature makes a contribution to the way extrinsic influences\ndetermine it? As we saw in the previous sections, some answer to this\nquestion is required to make sense of the PLMM, and hence of all of\nthe collision laws. The notion, shared by the teleological reading of\nconatus and the active reading of Spinozistic inertia, that it is in\nthe nature of bodies actively to strive of their own power, would seem\nto help. But is it Spinozistic? At a minimum, any articulation of this\nnotion must be free from illicit teleology.  Carriero (2017)\nsuggests a non-teleological reading of the conatus doctrine that seems\nsuitable.  On his view, conatus should be understood as an\nexpression of the idea that it is constitutive of their finite\nindividuality that individuals maximize their being. \n\u201cDynamic constructions do tend to maximize their being.  But\nthis is not because their reality is their end or good; it is an\nartifact of their stability as real individuals in the plenum\u201d\n(152).  But what accounts for this stability?  We require a\nmore probing examination into Spinoza's conception of the nature of\nindividual bodies.\n4. Bodies as modes of substance and as individuals.\n\nAs noted above, Spinoza accepts the basic Cartesian view that physical\nthings are res extensa\u2014extended things. However,\nwhereas Descartes held that distinct bodies are distinct extended\nsubstances, Spinoza famously holds that there is but one\nsubstance\u2014God or nature\u2014and that distinct bodies are\nmerely modes of this one substance, considered as extended. Spinoza's\nsubstance monism is in part motivated by inadequacies in the Cartesian\nview. Descartes officially defines substance in terms of independence:\na substance is that whose existence depends upon no other thing. But\nonly God satisfies this definition, all other beings depending on God\nfor their existence. So Descartes also allows for finite\nsubstances\u2014minds and bodies\u2014that are dependent only upon\nGod. But it is only in an equivocal sense that both God and created,\nfinite bodies and minds are substances. Spinoza will have none of\nthis. For him, independence is the sine qua non of substance,\nand nothing that is not its own cause \u2014 nothing whose existence\nis not of its essence\u2014is independent. Hence nothing finite and\ncreated is substantial. Further, since everything is either in itself\nor in another (Ia1), finite things like bodies are in substance, that\nis, they are in some way features of the one substance.\n\nThis denial of substantiality to bodies gives rise to an important\ninterpretive issue. The traditional concept of a substance has at\nleast two important strands. One is the idea we have already seen, of\nsubstance as independent. Spinoza clearly means his\n\u2018demotion\u2019 of bodies to modal status to be a denial that\nthey are substances in this sense. But another is the idea of a\nsubstance as an ultimate subject of predication, that is, as something\nof which properties or relations may be predicated, but which is\nitself never predicated of anything else. Does Spinoza mean to deny to\nbodies and other finite things this status as an ultimate subject as\nwell? That is, is talk of bodies fundamentally to be construed for\nSpinoza as predicative or adjectival on substance? Or do bodies,\nthough they are not substances, nonetheless lie on the subject side of\nthe subject/predicate divide, themselves bearers of properties, but\nnot strictly properties of anything else? This matter is of the utmost\nimportance for the understanding of Spinoza's physical theory, since\ndeciding that Spinoza held bodies to be in fact ways substance is and\nadjectival on it, in accord with the former interpretation, requires\nthat bodies as ordinarily conceived must be thought of as arising from\nand reducible to some more fundamental qualitative variation in\nspatiotemporal regions of extension. This has the consequence, to some\ncommentators salutary, of rendering Spinoza physical theory strongly\nprescient of contemporary physical views, in which ultimately physical\nnature is conceived as a field of gradient forces, bodies being not\nultimate, but rather the consequences of particular local\nconcentrations of certain classes of those forces, yielding certain\ncharacteristic effects in interactions, which effects we take as\nmarking the presence of bodies.\n\nIn favor of the adjectival reading (promoted by Bennett 1984) is\nSpinoza's use of the term \u201cmodus\u201d, or \u201cmode\u201d,\nin connection with bodies; this term regularly signifies a way\nsomething is, or a feature it has, functioning to group what are\nclearly predicates of things, and in Cartesian usage it means both\nthis and a dependent being. Against the adjectival reading, and in\nfavor of the view (promoted by Curley 1988) that Spinozistic bodies\nand minds are ultimate subjects of predication, is Spinoza's\npersistent references to bodies as individuals and as \n things.[5]\n\nThe\nadjectival view of bodies, unlike the subjectival, must therefore face\nthe difficult general question how individuals or things can be\npredicated of other individuals or things. However, the question of\nhow bodies are individuated\u2014the principles according to which\nthey are distinguished from one another and maintain identity through\ntime and change\u2014presents especially interesting and thorny\ndifficulties for both the adjectival and subjectival views of\nbodies.\n5. Individuation of bodies and the variety in matter\n\nWhile Descartes does claim (at least most of the time) that individual\nbodies are distinct substances, he does not invoke this claim in his\nofficial account of the individuation of bodies. The account he does\noffer is highly problematic. Descartes holds \u201call the variety in\nmatter, and all the diversity of its forms, depends on motion\u201d\n(Principles 2.23). Thus the distinction between bodies is\nconstituted of distinctions in the motions of regions of extension. On\nthe other hand, Descartes defines motion \u201cin the strict sense of\nthe term\u201d, as the relative change of position of a body relative\nto those bodies with which it is immediate contact\n(Principles 2.25). The circularity here is obvious, and\ncrippling. Diversity and variety of bodies depends on motion, but\nmotion depends upon a prior distinction between bodies.\n\nThat Spinoza was aware of the problem Descartes' views had accounting\nfor variety in extension is clear: in the late and much discussed\nletter 83 to Tschirnhaus, Spinoza writes,\n\nWith regard to your question as to whether the variety of things can\nbe demonstrated a priori solely from the conception of Extension, I\nbelieve I have already shown sufficiently clearly that this is\nimpossible, and that therefore Descartes is wrong in defining matter\nthrough extension; it must be explicated through an attribute that\nexpresses eternal and infinite essence.\n\n\nSpinoza goes on to express the hope that he may live long enough to\ndiscuss these matter more clearly, since \u201cthere has been no\nopportunity \u2026 to arrange these matters in proper order.\u201d\nHe died before the opportunity arose.\n5.1 The Physical Interlude\n\nBut perhaps he did present all the elements of these matters, though\nin improper, hence inadequate, order. The obvious place to look for\nsuch a presentation is in the so-called \u201cPhysical\nInterlude\u201d (hereinafter PI) following IIp13s, in which Spinoza\ngives his most extended and detailed discussion of his own views about\nthe nature of bodies and their principles of distinction and\nindividuation. But the PI seems to offer little\n help.[6]\n First, at least at the time of letter 83, Spinoza thought that what\nwas needed to help explain variety in matter was an appeal to an\nattribute that expresses infinite and eternal essence. Yet the text of\nthe PI makes no appeal to the infinitude, eternality or expressive\nnature of extension or any other attribute. More importantly, at least\non the face of it, the account of the individuation of bodies\npresented in the PI moves in much the same futile circle as that\noffered by Descartes. That motion serves to individuate bodies is\nquite explicit in PIDL1: \u201cBodies are distinguished from one\nanother by reason of motion and rest, speed and slowness.\u201d PID5\ngoes on to define \u201cbody, or Individual\u201d, in terms of\nmotion, and in a way that presupposes a plurality of bodies:\n\nWhen a number of bodies, whether of the same or of different size, are\nso constrained by other bodies that they lie upon one another, or, if\nthey so move, whether with the same degree or different degrees of\nspeed, that they communicate their motions to each other in a certain\nfixed manner, we shall say that those bodies are united with one\nanother and that they all together compose one body or Individual,\nwhich is distinguished from the others by this union of bodies.\n\n\nSince \u201cbody or individual\u201d is here defined in terms of the\nrelations among a plurality of bodies, PID5, to the extent it is meant\nto cover all bodies, is at best an inductive step of an inductive\ndefinition of body. The obvious candidates for the base case are what\nSpinoza calls \u201cthe simplest bodies\u201d, but the description\nand differentiation of these is likewise in terms of their motion and\nrest. Indeed, they \u201care distinguished from one another\nonly by motion and rest\u201d (PIL7s, italics\nadded).[7]\nSpinoza, then, appears to\naccord with Descartes in taking bodies to be distinguished by their\nrespective motion and rest. But motion and rest seem in the first\ninstance to be determinations of bodies. So the motion of\nbodies seems to presuppose a prior ground of their individuation.\n\nCommentators have tried various strategies for finessing the apparent\ncircularity in the PI's account of the diversity in matter. Klever\n(1988) urges that the key to understanding Spinoza's concept of matter\nis to see that physical nature is not to be conceived as an infinite\nextended expanse that somehow is put into motion, but as,\nfundamentally, matter-in-motion (\u201cmoles in\nmotu\u201d). According to Klever, \u201cmovement and rest in\nextension are examples of immediate production by God, whereas the\nface of the universe with its infinite variations is an example of the\nmediate effects, which are a product of movement in its turn.\u201d\nOn this interpretation, Spinoza, rather than seeing motion as a\nreceived quality of matter, conceives \u201cmatter as consequence of\nmotion\u201d (Klever 1988, p. 171). This reading arguably answers\nSpinoza's call to explain the variety in matter through an attribute\nthat expresses eternal and infinite essence. If God creates extended\nmatter, and then, in a separate act, sets it in motion, the attribute\nof Extension would not suffice as an eternal expression of infinite\nessence, since it requires God's additional action in its expression\nof power.\n5.2 Interpreting \u201cmotion and rest\u201d\n\nBut if this is right, then \u201cmotion and rest\u201d of the\nphysical interlude cannot simply be the ordinary motion and rest of\nbodies. What then are they? Klever waxes vague and anachronistic here,\nstraightaway seeking to validate his claim rhetorically by citing it\nas precedent of the view of contemporary physics: \u201cin this\nreversal [Spinoza] anticipates modern physics by which mass is\nconsidered as product of energy\u201d (ibid). (Hampshire (1987)\ncontains similar remarks).\n\nJonathan Bennett's influential reading agrees that Spinoza's physical\ntheory anticipates contemporary views. He also agrees that when\nSpinoza talks about \u201cmotion and\n rest\u201d[8]\n he is not invoking these terms in their ordinary senses. But rather\nthan simply identifying motion and rest with energy or any other trope\nof contemporary physical theory, Bennett holds that the terms function\nas mere placeholders for some basic physical quality, unknown to\nSpinoza, but required to make sense of the appearance of\nbodies\u2014ostensible things or subjects of predication\n\u2014 in the context of a metaphysics that holds that bodies, as\nmodes rather than substances, are not things or subjects at all, but\nrather ways that the one substance is. According to Bennett, Spinoza's\nExtension is, at the fundamental metaphysical level, a four\ndimensional field whose regions differ in the distribution and degree\nof this basic quality. Bodies are appearances, at one or more levels\nremoved from this base, of the continuous path in this field\nconstituted by relatively consistent local patterns of distribution of\nthis quality. The ordinary \u201cmotion\u201d of an ordinary\n\u201cbody\u201d is to be understood on the analogy with the way a\nthaw traverses a terrain. When the snow line recedes, there is no\nthing that changes its place; rather, there is a change in which\nregions of the landscape have the quality of being snow-covered, and\nthat change describes a continuous path.\n\nOne might object to that this analogy is not clearly persuasive.\nShifts of temperature lead to a thaw only because\nbodies\u2014ice crystals and aggregates thereof\u2014melt as\ntemperature rises, and their boundaries recede along the backdrop of a\nvery bodily landscape. Indeed, to thaw is just to pass from a solid to\na liquid state, and solidity is a benchmark of the bodily. If we\nexcise these bodily aspects of the analogy, it is unclear how much of\nits explanatory force remains. But then it is unclear just how well\nqualitative variations of fields can explain the appearance of bodies.\nPerhaps if we knew more about this quality, the sense in which such\ncontinuous paths of patterns of it could appear as or constitute\nbodies would be clearer. Garrett (1994) adopts Bennett's field\nmetaphysic, and attempts to fill in the explanatory gap by providing\ndefinite senses to the PI's uses of the terms \u201cmotion\u201d and\n\u201crest\u201d. Relying on Spinoza's remark, following\nPCP IIp22, that \u201cby force of moving bodies, we\nunderstand a quantity of motion \u2026. In bodies at rest, we\nunderstand by force of resisting a quantity of rest\u201d, Garrett\nclaims that by \u201cmotion\u201d and \u201crest\u201d in the PI,\nSpinoza means a quantity of force that moves a thing and a quantity of\nforce resisting such imposed movement, respectively. Furthermore,\nthese quantities can be ascribed, he says, to the regions of extension\nthemselves, rather than to bodies, thus overcoming the circularity\nproblem we found in Descartes. But it is unclear that Spinoza's text\ncan support this interpretation. PCP IIp22 speaks of the\nforce or motion \u201cin\u201d a body. Spinoza elaborates: \u201cBy\nforce in moving bodies, we understand a quantity of motion, which must\nbe greater, in bodies of equal size, as the speed of motion\nis greater \u2026 . But in bodies at rest we understand by\nforce of resisting a quantity of rest\u201d (emphasis added). In each\nmention, the force or resistance is attributed to a body. This\nstrongly suggests that quantity of motion and rest, as force and\nresistance, are features of\n bodies.[9]\n Moreover, even supposing that it makes interpretive sense to ascribe\nforce and resistance directly to regions, what is being attributed to\nthese regions seems to be a power to move bodies or to slow\nbodies down. Rather than showing how bodies could just be, or\narise from, fields of such forces, the forces themselves seem to be\ncharacterized in ways that presuppose body; the circularity, then,\nremains.\n\nIndividual bodies have an inherent stability, or robustness. They\nresist destructive incursion or change in their distinctive mode of\nendurance; they tend to persist in their configuration and motion in\nthe face of opposition to this persistence. Spinoza certainly accepts\nthis, as PID and IIIp6 show. If bodies either are, or are appearances\nof, persistent patterns of qualitative variation of extended regions,\nthen it seems necessary, though hardly sufficient, that something\nabout such patterns would have to account for this stability. But what\nmight do so? In effect, this is to ask what would account for the fact\nthat distributions of \u201cmotion\u201d and \u201crest\u201d,\nconceived of as predicates of extended regions, do not vary randomly\nthrough time. One suggestion is that nothing accounts for this\nstability at all, and that the duration of a body is nothing more than\nthe time through which a given complex ratio of motion and rest\nhappens, de facto, to characterize regions of extension whose sum over\ntime describes what can be construed as a continuous path. There is\nnothing to prevent such spatiotemporally continuous patterns from\noccurring. But there is nothing in being a time slice of such a\npattern that explains why the same pattern should also characterize\nany other spatiotemporal region continuous with it. There may, indeed\nmust, be kinematic 'laws' describing how such patterns vary (the scare\nquotes cause the counterfactual supporting status of such 'laws' would\nbe secured only by Spinoza's necessitarianism), but nothing about any\ngiven time slice of such patterns accounts for the fact that they are\nsubject to just those descriptive 'laws'. Individual time-slices of\nsuch patterns would be wholly passive with respect to the persistence\nand trajectory of the pattern as a whole.\n\nA significant problem with this\n line[10]\n is that Spinoza uses manifestly active language to describe the\ndoings of individuals. For example, IIId3 defines \u201caffect\u201d\nas \u201caffections of the body by which the body's power of\nacting is increased or diminished, aided or restrained, and at\nthe same time the idea of these affections\u201d (emphasis added).\nAnd in IIIp6, on which the entire psychological theory of the second\nhalf of the Ethics depends, Spinoza claims that individual\nthings strive to persevere in their being; his subsequent\nuses of the IIIp6 seem clearly to suggest that Spinoza intends this\nstriving to be understood as an a active principle rather than a mere\ntendency. On the conception of individuals as ratios of motion and\nrest that simply happen to endure, none of this would make\nany sense at all.\n\nViljanen, who also adopts Bennett's field metaphysic, with its\nimplicit denial that Spinozistic \u201cmotion and rest\u201d is to\nbe granted an ordinary signification, attempts to accommodate this\nconception of bodies as active and potent by reading the spatial field\nas a field of power, and bodies as constituted by differences in the\nintensity or strength of this power (Valjanen 2007, p. 402), and\napparent motion as the redistribution in that field of various\npatterns of intensification of that power (ibid., p. 403). He\nfurther interprets the \u201csimplest bodies\u201d of the PI \u2014\nthe basic constituents of all complex individuals \u2014 to be\ndistinguished as \u201crudimentary intensifications of spatial power,\nor extended power quanta, that invariably change place\u201d (Ibid.,\np. 408). But the question arises once again what the powers of which\nthese quanta are \u201cintensifications\u201d are powers to\ndo. They cannot, for reasons already mentioned, be powers to move\nor to resist bodies. The most obvious answer, in the Spinozistic\ncontext, would be \u201cpowers to persevere in its own being\u201d.\nBut to let the matter stand there would be simply to name the problem\nrather than to explain it. To the questions \u201cwhy does this\ndegree of spatial power persevere and endure in the (continuous) place\nand time to the extent that it does?\u201d, the answer would seem to\nbe \u201cbecause of the degree of power to persevere that constitutes\nit\u201d. But that is just to say that it manifests the powers it\ndoes because of the powers it has to do so \u2014 not very\nilluminating. \u201cMotion and rest\u201d as power appears to\nprovide either an incomplete or vacuous theory of indivuation.\n\nMoreover, if a body's motion in a spatial field, including that of the\nsimplest bodies, is just a change of location at which a given degree\nof power is instantiated, then there seems to be no means of\nexplaining why a particular degree of power would necessarily change\nlocations \u2014 move \u2014 continuously, as opposed to\ndiscontinuously. But surely it is in the nature of bodies as\nexplananda here that they are spatiotemporally continuous.\nFurthermore, if what individuates \u201cquanta of power\u201d are\njust their degrees of intensity \u2014 their degrees of power to\npersevere \u2014 then anywhere that degree is instantiated, that very\nsame body should be. But this would be consistent with the unlikely\nidea of discrete, discontinuous motion of a body, and indeed with the\nbi-location of bodies, that is, with the idea that a single body might\nbe wholly present in each of multiple regions. Assuming that Spinoza\nwould not accept these possibilities, the theory of \u201cmotion and\nrest\u201d as signifying spatial regions of power distinguished by\ndegrees of power fails to account for signal characteristics of body.\nIt is thus doubtful that the inadequacy of Descartes' identification\nof body with extension can be overcome simply by predicating regions\nof extension with different degrees of \u201cpower\u201d.\n\nThere are, then, reasons to doubt that granting Spinoza's \u201crest\nand motion\u201d a non-ordinary signification\u2014energy, an\nunspecified basic quality, force of motion and resistance,\nintensifications of power \u2014 can in fact give us insight into the\nconstitution or appearance of persisting, resistant, active bodies.\nBut it is worth asking whether these doubts in fact rest on an\ninappropriate imaginative basis. It seems difficult imaginatively to\nrepresent variegated fields of energy, force, or any other quality in\nsuch a way as to make clear how bodies, with the persistent resistance\nand capacities for interaction we ordinarily represent them to have,\ncould possible appear from or be constituted by them. But this sort of\nfailure of imaginative thinking cannot count against the acceptability\nof a theory from a proper Spinozistic perspective. On his view, our\nknowledge of body as an object of imagination is inherently\ninadequate. Our imaginative ideas of bodies in their corporeality are\nlimited to the ideas of modifications of our own bodies. These in turn\nreflect only in a confused and partial way the natures of both the\nbodies with which we are affected and our own. At no time is the full\nnature of any body reflected in any of the ideas we have through these\naffections, hence through anything we can imagine. Hence our\nimaginations cannot grasp the nature of body, and failure of the\nfaculty of imagination to provide insight into the link between the\nfundamental basis for variety in matter and that variety itself is to\nbe expected. All of this is clear from IIp16\u201331. Any appearance\nof insight into the nature of body gleaned from the imagination is as\nlikely to be illusion as illumination.  And, as Schliesser (2017)\nremarks in emphasizing Spinoza's skepticism about knowledge of the\nnatural world, for Spinoza, \u201cwhen we locate things at a time and\nplace, we are always in the realm of the imagination\u201d\n(p. 175).\n\nBut if we cannot come to an imaginative grasp of how bodies or their\nappearances might be constituted out of fields, then through what sort\nof intellectual act might we do so? In the context of early modern\nphilosophy of physical nature, and in particular the Cartesian\nphilosophy in which Spinoza is steeped, the clarity and distinctness\nof mathematical ideas provides the contrast to the incompleteness and\nconfusion of ideas of the imagination and sensation. And certainly the\nquantifiability of properly physical qualities, and consequently their\ncomprehensibility within a closed system of mathematical laws, is of\nthe utmost importance to the credentials of the fundamental notions of\nthe contemporary physical theory Spinoza is alleged to have\nanticipated. The scientific success of classical mechanics, relativity\ntheory, and, especially, quantum mechanics owes much more to the\npredictive and formal success of these theories than it does to our\nabilities to represent phenomena in the imagination that answer to the\nbasic physical elements they countenance. Point masses, gravitational\nforces operating at a distance, curvatures of space time, finite but\nunsurpassable velocities, and wave-packets all seem to surpass our\npowers of imaginative representation. We have no real capacity to\nimagine how the solid table on which my computer rests can be\nidentical to both a swirling cloud of particles and a warp in the very\nfabric of space. On the other hand, these fundamental scientific\nnotions can be rendered mathematically, placed within a system of\nlaws, and employed to great effect in predicting and manipulating,\nhence effectively representing, the same nature we represent\nimaginatively.\n\nThus perhaps the proper criterion, or at any event a proper\ncriterion, for the success of an Spinozistic account of variety in\nmatter and its individuation into bodies is the quantifiability of the\nbasic properties in which it proceeds. Gabbey stresses this line with\nadmirable clarity.\n\nTo talk of bodies maintaining among themselves \u201cthe same\nproportion of motion and rest,\u201d or communicating motion to each\nother \u201cin a certain fixed proportion\u201d is to say nothing\neffective, unless a mathematical account is provided of those\nproportions and of the measures of motion and rest from which they are\nformed, and unless there is some account of the laws that ensure the\nclaimed invariance in proportionalities. Spinoza provides no such\nlaws, nor does he say how the proportions are to be mathematically\nexpressed (Gabbey 1996, p. 168).\n\n\nGabbey concludes that the theory of bodily individuation by ratio of\nmotion and rest \u201clacks quantitative anchoring\u201d, and is\nthus \u201ctoo vague to allow a assessment of what is being\nclaimed\u201d (Gabbey 1996, p. 169).\n\nThat Spinoza did not himself provide the mathematicization of his\nnotion of motion-and-rest that would render his theory of body\nnon-circular and sufficiently clear to be understood (or imagined)\ndoes not entail that this cannot be done. A number of commentators\nhave attempted to show that Spinoza's account of variety in matter by\nappeal to \u201cmotion and rest\u201d can be so rendered. Garrett,\nwhose account we have already examined, nods his head in this\ndirection. Recall that PId5 defines an individual as being composed of\nbodies that \u201ccommunicate their motions to one another in a\ncertain fixed manner\u201d. Later lemmas characterize this fixed\nmanner as a \u201cratio\u201d of motion and rest. Notwithstanding\nhis realization that, for a number of reasons, such a ratio must be\nunderstood as a pattern rather than a numerical proportion, Garrett's\nexpresses sanguine confidence that \u201cany such pattern could be\nexpressed by a mathematical formula\u201d (1994, p. 86). Matson\n(1990) also places weight on the possible quantifiability of motion\nand rest as a means of in rendering it a clear and distinct,\nnon-imaginary basis for our understanding of the individuation of\nbodies, taking the idea of an atomic number as his model:\n\nBeing element No. 16 \u201cpertains to the essence\u201d of sulfur,\nas being yellow and smelly do not. One can in a sense\n\u201cimagine\u201d sulfur by its color and odor; but only by\narticulating it into the attribute, as the atomic number does, can one\nunderstand it\u2026. \u2018Element No. 16\u2019, together with the\ncomprehensive theory in which this conception is embedded, is a\nspecification of \u2018motion and rest\u2019, indicating, in fact,\nthat particular unique \u2018proportion of motion and rest\u2019\nthat is the necessary and sufficient condition for being sulfur.\n(Matson 1990, pp. 88\u201389).\n\n\nMatson piggybacks on to this analogy the formula for the identity of\nany living thing supposedly found in its genetic code.\n\nIf it is right to think of atomic numbers as the specifications of\nmotion and rest for certain stuffs, in the case of the human being (or\nany living creature) the obvious analogue is the genetic code, the\nformula for the structure of the individual's (quasi-unique) DNA\nmolecule (Matson 1990, p. 89).\n\n\nTreating such structures as representable by formulae enhances the\nimpression that they are expressible in numerically quantifiable\nterms.\n\nSuch attempts to interpret motion and rest as numerically expressible\nquantities constitute efforts to make Spinoza's physical theory\nrelevant to contemporary science, by displaying how it can conform to,\nand even constitute a blueprint for, its mathematical structure. They\nstand, then, as responses both to Gabbey's implication that because\nSpinoza does not say how his notion of motion and rest can be\nexpressed mathematically, his views are too vague and sterile to be of\nsuch contemporary relevance, and to the difficulties we have seen, in\nconceiving how motion and rest, as we conceive them imaginatively,\ncould possibly serve to individuate bodies. But at the end of the\nfinal section of this article, we will see that, quite apart from the\nvagueness, anachronism (Spinoza anticipating not just Mendeleyev, but\nalso Watson and Crick?) and other interpretative difficulties faced by\nsuch attempts, there are reasons to suppose that any effort to render\nbasic principles of physical theory through numerical quantification\nmay run deeply counter to Spinoza's own attitude.\n5.3 Individuation by essence\n\nIn the previous sub-section, we saw reasons for doubting the adequacy\nof readings that treat the PI's talk of motion and rest as\nconstituting his entire account of \n  individuation.[11]\nThis section considers an\nalternative interpretation of Spinoza's approach to individuation.\nThis account appeals to the notion of individuating essences.\n\nIn IId2 Spinoza says:\n\nto the essence of a thing belongs that which, being given, the thing\nis necessarily posited and which, being taken away, the thing is\nnecessarily taken away; or that without which the thing can neither be\nnor be conceived, and which can neither be nor be conceived without\nthe thing.\n\n\nThis does not quite offer a definition of \u201cessence\u201d, but\nrather defines what belongs to it. IId2 speaks of the essences of\n\u201cthings.\u201d Individuals, or singular things, are surely\nthings. If what belongs to the essence of an individual is given (by\n\u201cgiven\u201d Spinoza means \u201cposited as existing\u201d),\nthen so too is the individual. This suggests that the essence of an\nindividual is particular to that individual, since otherwise, what\nbelongs to it could be given without that individual being posited, so\nlong as some other individual with that essence were\n posited.[12]\n\nBut how are we to conceive essences, and how can they help solve the\nproblems we have encountered with claiming the PI, with its talk of\nmotion and rest, provides Spinoza's full account of individuation? In\nthe Preface to Ethics Part IV, Spinoza writes:\n\nWhen I say that someone passes from a lesser to a greater perfection,\nand the opposite, I do not understand that he is changed from one\nessence, or form, to another\u2026 . Rather, we conceive that his\npower of acting, insofar as it is understood through his nature, is\nincreased or diminished.\n\n\nHere Spinoza writes as if a body's essence and its form are one and\nthe same. In each of PIl4, 5 and 6, Spinoza speaks of bodily\npersistence in terms of its parts keeping the same ratio of motion and\nrest. If the parts do so, the body, says Spinoza \u201cwill retain\nits nature, as before, with no change of form\u201d\n(emphasis added). PIl7 also speaks of a body's retaining its\n\u201cnature\u201d, despite change. These are plainly meant to state\nconditions on individual persistence. These lemmas seem to equate\nnature and form. So by transitivity of identity, form=nature=essence.\nMoreover, Spinoza implies that so long as this form or essence is\nretained, a thing is not destroyed. \u201cForm\u201d,\n\u201cnature\u201d and \u201cessence\u201d than, refer to\nsomething in virtue of the persistence of which an individual retains\nits identity.\n\nIn a series of propositions leading up to and supporting IIIp6's\narticulation of the conatus doctrine, Spinoza also treats\n\u201cessence\u201d and \u201cnature\u201d as synonyms, and\nassigns them to things independently of the attribute under which they\nare considered. IIIp4 is worthy of particular attention here. It\nstates: \u201cNo thing can be destroyed except through an external\ncause\u201d. Garrett (2002) persuasively argues that\n\u201cexternal\u201d here contrasts, not with \u201con the\ninside\u201d, but with \u201cinherent\u201d, where inherence is a\ntechnical notion referring to what belongs to a thing in virtue of its\nessence. This includes both the thing's essence and those properties\nfollowing from it. These are all \u201cin\u201d the thing. However,\na thing may also have accidental properties, which are\n\u201cin\u201d it in the general sense in which that which is\npredicated of a thing is in it, and may also be \u201cin\u201d it in\nthe sense in which one region surrounded by another is in it, but\nwhich do not inhere in it. Such properties, in the thing in one sense\nbut external to it in another, may be destructive of the thing. In\nIIIp4d, Spinoza writes \u201cwhile we attend only to a thing\nitself, and not to the external causes, we shall not be able to\nfind anything in it which can destroy it\u201d (emphasis\nadded). Reading \u201cin\u201d here in the sense of\n\u201cinherent\u201d, and \u201cexternal\u201d in the sense of\n\u201cnot inherent\u201d, this passage suggests that to attend to a\nthing itself is just to attend to its essence\u2014what is affirmed\nin its definition\u2014and what follows from it. To attend to what is\nnot inherent in it is to attend to what is external to it, to\nsomething else. An actually existing thing, then, such as an existing\nbody, is its essence brought to existence. So long as a thing retains\nits essence=nature=form, it retains whatever inheres in it, and\nendures as the same individual.\n\nThe appeal to individuating essences accounts for the robust\npersistence of bodies. In IIIp6 Spinoza says that \u201cEach thing,\nas far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in is own\nbeing\u201d. In arguing for this conatus doctrine, Spinoza states\nthat \u201csingular things\u201d are that \u201cby which God's\nattributes are expressed in a certain and determinate way, i.e.,\nthings that express, in a certain and determinate way, God's power, by\nwhich God is and acts\u201d. \u201cThings\u201d here takes the\nactive position. Things express power; they do the\nexpressing. They are not mere expressions of it. Power is\nexpressed by things, rather than merely through them. Because\nthis is an active expression of power, the thing not only persists\nthrough externally caused changes, but opposes those changes which\nwould tend to destroy it, i.e., to keep it from expressing God's power\nin the way which constitutes its essence. Finally, in IIIp7, Spinoza\nexpressly identifies this striving with the thing's essence;\n\u201cthe striving by which each thing strives to persevere in its\nbeing is nothing but the actual essence of the thing.\u201d\n\nThus the form or essence of a thing, which individuates it, and whose\nretention through change constitutes the persistence of an individual,\njust is its inherent and individual power of striving to retain just\nform, hence to resist those extrinsic determinants that would diminish\nits power and destroy it. In the case of body, striving is expressed\nby the active tendency of a pattern of relative motion and rest, in\ntheir ordinary sense, of its parts to persist. The active tendency of\nthat pattern to persist is the essence of the individual body. That\npattern is determined in its existence transiently and externally; now\nthis way, and now that, now larger, now smaller, now swifter, now\nslower, now with these parts, now those. Such transient, external\ndetermination may give it accidental properties that oppose and hinder\nthe power of action it has in virtue of what inheres in it, and hence\nlimit its power of action. Another virtue of the idea that essence as\nactive striving is what individuates bodies is that it would provide a\nbasis in the nature of body for the principle of inertia, in such a\nway that inertia could be taken as a ground for the PLMM we earlier\nsaw was needed to underwrite the collision laws.\n\nHowever, this view is certainly not without its \nproblems.[13]\nIndeed, one of its strengths\u2014helping to ground inertia in the\npersistent activity of bodies \u2014 is a weakness. We saw earlier\nthat it is not easy to square this active reading of inertia, grounded\nas it is in the idea of motion pertaining to the action proper to a\nbody, with a good deal of what Spinoza says in the first and second\nparts of the\nEthics about how no body can be determined to produce an\neffect unless is it so determined externally. Another, related problem\nfor this interpretation is that it represents Spinoza as, not an\navant-garde thinker anticipating modern physics, but as a rear guard\ndefender, despite his official anti-scholastic stance, of the\ntraditional neo-Aristotelian doctrines of essence and substantial\nform, open to the same charges of ad hoc theorizing and of\nappeal to occult powers that Modernity and the Scientific Revolution\nlevelled against that tradition in their rise to intellectual\ndominance. Indeed, the notion of the individual essence of a body\nconceived as a power to maintain itself is of dubious intelligibility.\nSpinoza clearly believes that an individual's power to persevere can\nincrease or diminish. But if this power is to constitute the thing's\nessence and identity, such changes in degree cannot alter the identity\nof the power. But what then constitutes the individuality and identity\nof a power? In this light, the account of individuation by essence\nseems unexplanatory: either it amounts to an elaborate name for the\nproblem of the individuation of bodies it is supposed to solve, or it\nsimply displaces the same sort of problem from bodies to powers.\n\nThe problem we have been addressing is to find in Spinoza a\nsatisfactory ground for the idea that modes of extension consititute\nbodies to which dynamical laws like the laws of collision should\napply.  We have characterized that problem in terms of the\n\u201crobust persistence\u201d of bodies \u2013 their resistance to\nchange.  Barry (2021) presents a detailed and complex treatment of\npossible ways Spinoza might be thought to account for the resistence\nto change bodies manifest in the dynamics of collision.  He argues\nthat neither Spinoza's account of inertia nor the conatus doctrine can\nsupport resistance, and that a more direct appeal to modes as\nexpressions of God's power or activity cannot do so either.  He\nsuggests tentatively that, via Spinoza's parallelism (EP27), the\nresistance characteristic of bodies might instead be read off of the\nresistance relatively adequate ideas have to alteration in the face of\nrelatively less adequate ideas.  This reverses the more usual\ndirection of reading off features of ideas from those of their modal\ncounterparts in extension; but, despite Spinoza's remark in letter 27\n(to de Vries) that ethics is to be founded on metaphysics and physics,\nturnabout here should be fair play.  As Barry recognizes, however,\nsince not all features of modes of one attribute can be applied to the\ncounterparts under the other attributes, there must be something\nidentifiable in bodies that corresponds to the adequacy of ideas in\nvirtue of which they resist other ideas if the strategy is to work.\nThe extended counterpart of adequacy Barry fixes on is the degree to\nwhich the collection of component bodies whose relation consitutues a\ncomposite individual body communicate their rest and motion to one\nanother in a fixed manner, as discussed in the PI.  One might argue\nthat, had Barry taked that idea seriously enough in his discussion of\ninertia and the PI, the detour through Thought via the parallelism\nwould have been unnecessary.  In any event, Barry worries here that\nappreal to adequacy explains at best resistance to change i.e., the\nability of a body to retain the same ratio of motion and rest in a\ncollision, but not the ability to produce a change; i.e., the power of\na body to move or alter another, both of which powers Spinoza clearly\nattributes to bodies.\n\nWhether there is a sufficient Spinozistic ground for for a unified\nconception of the power of modes both to resist and to bring about\nchanges in other modes of the the attribute under which they are\nconsidered remains an open question.  It seems likely, however,\nthat reading the PI, the conatus doctrine, and Spinoza's accounts and\njustifications of inertia and the dynamical laws in the light of\nthe fact that modes each express in their own way the\ninfinite actvity and power of the one substance provides the\nbest hope for illuminating such ground.  \n6. Spinoza and the experimental and mathematical sciences\n\nAttempts to find anticipations of contemporary scientific physics in\nSpinoza's thinking about the physical face a number of challenges\nbeyond simple anachronism. Contemporary physics is both resolutely\nexperimental and resolutely mathematical. However, there is reason to\nsuppose that Spinoza had dim views of both experimental method in\n science[14]\n and the prospects for an insightful mathematical description of\nnature.\n6.1 Observation\n\nIt is by now widely accepted that observation is \u201ctheory\nladen\u201d, and that therefore the idea that scientific theory\nproceeds through the neutral collection of data is bogus. Studies in\nthe logic of confirmation have likewise put an end to the\nsimple-minded idea that experimental method involves devising crucial\nexperiments whose results can, as a matter of logic, falsify a theory,\nor force a choice among competing theories. Nonetheless, modern\nscience is still thoroughly empirical, relying heavily and essentially\non observation and experimentation in the generation, development, and\ntesting of theories. The truism that one can always save a theory by\nrejecting auxiliary assumptions or discrediting data\u2014reports of\nobservation\u2014does not change the facts that, in practice,\nobservational results are taken to refute theories, and the ability to\npredict and explain a wide range of observable phenomena better than\nrivals remains the gold standard in scientific method.\n\nSpinoza, however, discounted the relevance of observational data to\nthe discovery of truths of nature. His conception of sense experience\nseems, in fact, to disqualify it from being a reliable source of\ninformation about the world altogether. He held that sense experience,\nin which the human body is affected by external bodies, can never\nprovide us with adequate ideas of either external bodies or our own.\nHe seems moreover to have denied that the method by which we discover\nnew truths involves either the collection of new sensory evidence or\nthe construction of crucial experiments. Indeed, much of the early\nTreatise on the Emendation of the Intellect is devoted to\nestablishing that \u201cthe fictitious, the false, and the other\n[ideas falling short of truth] have their origin in the imagination,\ni.e., in certain sensations that are fortuitous, and as it were\ndisconnected, since they do not arise from the very power of the mind,\nbut from external causes, as the body (whether awake or dreaming)\nreceives various motions\u201d (EMI, \u00b684). The intellect unaided\nby imagination, however construed, is the sole source of knowledge.\nObservation, which involves sensory ideas derived from external\ncauses, has no role in the true method for acquiring adequate\nknowledge.\n\nIn IIp25 Spinoza states \u201cThe idea of any affection of the human\nbody does not involve adequate knowledge of an external body\u201d.\nSense perception\u2014the basis of experimental observation\u2014is\na matter of the body's being affected by external bodies. So it would\nseem that, prima facie, Spinoza cannot have held that\nobservation can be a means to an adequate knowledge of things.\nScientific knowledge\u2014scientia\u2014would, for Spinoza,\nhave to be adequate. Hence it seems that experimental observation\nought to be, for Spinoza, irrelevant to science. There is strong\nconfirmation to be found for this conclusion in Spinoza's accounts of\nthe kinds of knowledge.\n\nIn IIp40s2, Spinoza discusses four kinds of knowledge or modes of\ncognition. These are I) knowledge from singular things; II) knowledge\nfrom signs; III) knowledge from common notions; and IV) intuitive\nknowledge. The first two are prone to falsity, as they generate\ninadequate ideas. Cognition of kind (I) arises from objects\nrepresented \u201cthrough the senses in a way that is mutilated,\nconfused, and without order for the intellect\u201d. This is\nperception from \u201cexperientia vaga\u201d, vague or\nrandom experience. Knowledge of kind (II) arises from hearsay, arising\n\u201cfrom the fact that having heard or read certain words, we\nrecollect things, and form certain ideas of them \u2026 through\nwhich we imagine them.\u201d Spinoza groups (I) and (II) together as\nknowledge of the first kind: opinion or imagination. Inadequate and\nconfused ideas pertain to knowledge of the first kind, and so it is\nthe sole cause of falsity. Both of the sorts of knowledge of the first\nkind depend upon what we would ordinarily call sense experience.\nSpinoza does not go so far as to assert explicitly that no true\nknowledge can ever arise from sense experience. It is only when the\nsenses present us with representations in a way that is\n\u201cmutilated, confused and without order for the intellect\u201d\n(IIp40s2), i.e., random, that our resulting conceptions are\ninadequate. But the question is whether there is any other way, on\nSpinoza's views about sense perception, that the senses can represent\nobjects to us. Knowledge of the third kind, intuitive knowledge, does\nnot appear to involve the senses at all. It is knowledge proceeding\n\u201cfrom an adequate idea of the formal essence of certain\nattributes of God to the adequate knowledge of the essence of\nthings\u201d (IIp40s2). This knowledge, then, arises from the\nintellectual consideration of the essence of an attribute itself,\nrather than from sensuous commerce with modes of that attribute.\nKnowledge of the second kind, reason, seems a more plausible candidate\nfor arising from experience. This is based on the so-called\n\u201ccommon notions\u201d. Common notions are conceptions of things\n\u201cwhich are common to all, and which are equally in the part as\nin the whole\u201d IIp38. Such conceptions can only be adequate, and\nthis would guarantee that the knowledge arising from such conceptions\nis true. Spinoza also allows that if there were something common and\npeculiar to the human body and external bodies by which it is\naffected, and equally in the part as in the whole of each, then the\nhuman mind will conceive that thing adequately. The problem, however,\nis that given Spinoza's views about sensation is it hard to see how\nsuch common notions could arise from sensation, and to the extent we\ncan make sense of this, the common notions seem limited to ideas of\nextremely general features of physical objects, far too general to be\na source of any of the kinds of particular observational knowledge\nrequired for experimental practice. The inadequacy of a conception of\na thing results from its not reflecting the entire nature of a thing's\ncauses. Knowledge of effects is by knowledge of causes, and while\nthings can interact causally only insofar as they share something in\ncommon, there can be aspects of the causes of things not reflected in\ntheir effects. However, if a conception is of something common to an\nobject and all other things, then there can be nothing in any of its\ncauses not reflected in the conception of it itself; whatever is\npresent in the cause will be present in it as well, hence reflected in\nthe idea of it. But what, we may ask, is even possibly shared by each\nthing and equally in the part of each as in the whole? The only\nobvious candidates are properties that, as Schliesser (2017, p. 15)\nputs it, \u201creflect the peculiar modal qualities of \u2026 a\nmode\u201d: in the case of extended modes, those sorts of properties\nthat follow from the nature of extension: e.g., motion and rest,\ntaking up space, being subject to motion and to the laws of geometry,\netc.. But the sorts of observational knowledge that are crucial to\nexperimental method in science are hardly exhausted by the knowledge\nthat pertains to bodies as such. Indeed, experimental observation\ndepends precisely on the observational knowledge of differences,\nrather than similarities.\n\nSpinoza characterizes experiential vaga as experience that is\n\u201cwithout order for the intellect\u201d and as \u201cexperience\nthat is not determined by the intellect\u201d (Treatise on the\nEmendation of the Intellect, \u00b619). This experience is called\n\u201crandom\u201d because \u201cit comes to us by chance, and\nsince \u201dwe have no other experiment to oppose it\u201c;\nperception attained in this mode it \u201dremains with us\nunshaken\u201c. Perception from random experience can, then, be\nshaken by opposing experiment, but there is nothing here that suggests\nthis is a matter of less random experience overruling more, rather\nthan multiple random experiences conflicting with one another.\nMoreover, Spinoza really never tells us what it would be for\nexperience to be \u201dordered for\u201c or \u201ddetermined\nby\u201c the intellect. It is tempting to suppose that he meant,\nfollowing Bacon, from whom the term \u201dexperientia\nvaga\u201c is borrowed, that experience is not vague insofar as\nit \u201dproceeds by fixed law, without interruption and in regular\norder\u201c. (Bacon, Novum Organon, Book I, Aphorism 100).\nBut it is unclear, given Spinoza's general denigration of sense\nexperience as generating only inadequate ideas of things, how the\nintellect could order the collection of sense experience by law, and\nit is equally unclear how the result of doing so would shore up the\ninadequacy of the resulting\n observations.[15]\n Bennett, who resists the standard view that Spinoza thought\nexperience irrelevant to knowledge, and cites the possibility of\nexperientia non-vaga, i.e., experience as directed\nby the intellect, as evidence for this, concedes that Spinoza is\nentirely silent about experientia non-vaga, offering\nno account of what it might be, other than \u201dthe experience of\nsomeone who puts to nature questions dictated to him by Spinoza's\nphilosophy\u201c (Bennett 1984, p. 24). Bennett's suggestion that a\ncharacterization of this might have to wait until we learn more about\nhow the senses function seems a non-starter, though. For if we\nconceive the senses as objects of empirical, experimental study, then\nwe cannot learn about them until we know how to order our experience,\nso the question is begged; and if we conceive of them as objects for\nnon-experiential, non-experimental philosophical reflection, then what\nmore by way of the Spinozistic carrying out of this sort of work is\nthere to be done than Spinoza does in the\n Ethics?[16]\n6.2 Experimentation\n\nSpinoza engaged in very little experimentation of his own, but he did\nshow some interest in the experimental results of others. His letters\ncontain several discussions of experimental and theoretical dioptrics,\nto be expected from a lens grinder and man of letters, as well as\ndiscussions of recent observations of comets and whether they can be\nexplained on Cartesian principles, of the new microscope, and of\nmedical and alchemical experiments. Far and away the most famous and\nsignificant discussion of experimentation are found in his exchanges\nwith Henry Oldenburg, the first Secretary of the Royal Society, who\noperated largely as the mouthpiece of Robert Boyle, and in particular\nthose concerning Boyle's experiments on solidity, fluidity, and on\nnitre. The latter of these is the most telling of Spinoza's attitude\ntowards the relevance of experiment to theorizing about nature. Boyle\nhad claimed to show that nitre (potassium nitrate) is a chemical\ncompound rather than a mixture, by having decomposed it into fixed and\nvolatile parts (potash and spirit of nitre), and then recombining them\ninto nitre with little or no loss of quantity. The disparate\nproperties of the components, he argued, showed that the nitre itself\nwas a compound, in which the components were altered and transformed,\nrather than a mere mixture. This, in turn, suggested that the basic\nconstituents of the components were preserved through the interaction,\nconfirming the corpuscular chemical theory over the scholastic view\nthat chemical transformation involves the substantial form of given\nmatter being destroyed and replaced by some other substantial\nform.\n\nSpinoza in fact agrees with Boyle that the scholastic view is\nbankrupt, but he rejects Boyle's claim that the separation of the\nnitre into two parts is actually a decomposition of a distinctive\nsubstance into two others; rather, he claims that the experiment is\nconsistent with the Cartesian view, itself based on reason, that\ndifferentiations among extended substance are always owing to\ndifferent quantities of motion and rest. He claimed that the\n\u201dfixed nitre\u201c (potash) was actually an impurity mixed into\nthe original sample, and that the spirit of nitre was simply the\nvolatile state of the pure, crystallized nitre portion of the original\nmix. Thus the different chemical properties of spirit of nitre and the\noriginal sample owe not to a difference of substantial\nstructure\u2014the basic shape of the particles of each is the\nsame\u2014but to a difference in their motion. In support of this\nreading and against Boyle's interpretation, Spinoza claimed that, if\nBoyle were actually to show what he claimed, \u201dfurther experiment\nseems to be required to show that Spirit of Nitre is not really Nitre,\nand cannot be reduced to solid state or crystallized without the help\nof salt of lye\u201c (Letters, p. 71). Spinoza then went on at some\nlength to show how, in the absence of such a demonstration, it is easy\nenough to explain the results of Boyle's experiments along Cartesian\nlines. He further explains several experiments he himself performed\nwhich he takes to support the Cartesian interpretation, claiming that\nhe \u201dmight have added further experiments which would perhaps\nmake the matter quite clear\u201c (Letters, p. 76).\n\nWhat matters here is not who is right in this dispute, nor whether\nSpinoza's Cartesian view is in fact coherent, but Spinoza's strategy.\nFor it is hardly an evenhanded assessment of the experimental results.\nSpinoza shows considerable ingenuity in interpreting the results of\nBoyle's own experiments to be consistent with the Cartesian view, and\nhis own as (nearly, anyway) proof positive of it. But he shows no\ninclination to pursue the question whether his own experimental\nresults can be interpreted along the lines of Boyle's hypothesis,\nwhich they can be, easily enough, as Boyle's response (letter 11)\nshows. Indeed, Boyle complains overall that Spinoza's interpretations\nof the experimental results are wholly driven by Cartesian theory,\nrather than a fair attempt to adjudicate between the two alternatives.\nFor example, far from proving the need for the \u201dvery fine\nmatter\u201c of Cartesian physics, this conclusion has been\n\u201dassumed\u201c, by Spinoza, \u201dsimply from the hypothesis\nof the impossibility of a vacuum\u201c. In other aspects of his\ninterpretation, claims Boyle, Spinoza \u2018presupposes Descartes'\ntheory of fire\u201d. Now Boyle's readings of the experimental data\nare hardly less theory driven than are Spinoza's. But where they\ndiffer strategically is in the fact that since the Cartesian theory\nthat drives Spinoza's interpretations is derived by the method of pure\nrational reflection on perceptions that are a priori clear\nand distinct, Spinoza clearly grants it a privileged standing in the\ncourt of experimentation. On his view, to prove a conclusion that is\nat odds with one dictated by reason itself, like Descartes', one has\nto establish impossibility experimentally\u2014which cannot,\nof course, be done. So long as it is possible to interpret results as\nconsistent with a theory determined by rational reflection alone,\nthose results cannot weigh at all against the theory. Yet experimental\nresults that conform to rationally determined theory confirm it.\n\nIndeed, where there are properly philosophical arguments to be had for\na thesis, experimentation is superfluous. In assessing Boyle's\nexperiments designed to prove that all tangible properties depend on\nthe mechanical features of objects, Spinoza wonders why Boyle\nbothered, since this conclusion \u201chas already been abundantly\nproved by Verulam, and later Descartes\u201d. (Letter 6). Descartes\nhad proved this a priori from the fact that the sole nature\nof body is extension, whose sole attributes are size, shape and\nmotion. Moreover, ordinary, mundane observations offer as good proof\nas any that might be afforded by controlled observation. Boyle's\ncareful experiments could not add any weight to the evidence already\navailable from such ordinary phenomena as the facts that even cold\nsticks will spark a fire when rubbed together, that water makes sound\nwhen it comes to a moving boil, and that stirring and warming foul\nsmelling bodies make them smell yet worse. Spinoza's attitude towards\nexperimental observation seems to be, then, that it can have no weight\nagainst a theory based in sound a priori philosophical intuition and\ngeometrical demonstration, and is easy available, though not\nnecessary, to confirm the results of such pure theorizing.\nExperimentation can help us discover new phenomena, but it cannot help\nus to prove any scientific propositions we do not already know to be\ntrue. As Gabbey (1996) puts it, experimentation \u201ccannot uncover\nthe nature of things; sensory knowledge belongs to the imagination,\nthe knowledge of essences and causes to the intellect alone\u201d\n(Gabbey 1996, p. 171).\n6.3 Mathematical science\n\nObservation and experimentation are no more central to contemporary\nscientific practice than is quantification. Contemporary physical\ntheory, which Spinoza is said to have anticipated, is thoroughly\nquantitative in character. Theories are expressed in quantitative\nterms; giving an explanation of a phenomenon is typically a matter of\ngenerating a mathematically formulated law that covers it. Unifying\ntheories is a matter of showing how the mathematical formulae that\ncomprise them can be derived from one another, how the phenomena they\nconcern can be commensurated. Indeed, observation itself is irrelevant\nto modern physical theory unless it is expressed in quantitative\nterms, since the prediction yielded by physical theories are\npredictions of what the observed measures of things will be. This, in\nturn, requires that the phenomena observed must be measurable.\n\nSpinoza is, in a fairly obvious way, a champion of a mathematical\napproach to understanding the physical world. But Spinoza's\nmathematical model is Euclidean geometry, and this is not a domain of\nmathematics that deals with quantities as measurable. And indeed,\nthere is strong evidence that Spinoza thought that a proper\nunderstanding of physical nature can never be expressed in terms of\nmeasurable quantities. For measure, both of spatial extent and\ntemporal duration, is a mere aid to the imagination, and not a means\nof intellectually understanding. In Letter 12 to Meyer, Spinoza\ndistinguishes two ways of conceiving quantity. One is abstract and\nsuperficial, as we have it is sensation and imagination; on this\nconception quantities can be finite, divisible, and composed of parts.\nThe other is through the intellect's grasp of substance in which\n\u201cwe apprehend the thing as it is in itself\u201d; on this\nconception, quantity is infinite, indivisible, and a unity. Spinoza\ngoes on to elaborate how measure of spatial and temporal quantity\nderives from the abstract, superficial conception of quantity, and\nleads to nothing but confusion in the attempt to understand physical\nnature. His discussion is worth quoting at length.\n\nFrom the fact that we are able to delimit Duration and Quantity as we\nplease, conceiving quantity in abstraction from Substance and\nseparating the efflux of duration from things eternal, there arise\nTime and Measure: Time to delimit Duration and Measure to delimit\nQuantity in such wise as enables us to imagine them easily, as far as\npossible. Again, from the fact we separate the affections of substance\nfrom substance itself, and arrange them in classes so that can easily\nimagine them as far as possible, there arises Number, whereby we\ndelimit them. Hence it can be seen clearly that measure, Time and\nNumber are nothing other than modes of thinking, or rather, modes of\nimagining. It is therefore not surprising that all who have attempted\nto understand the workings of nature by such concepts, and furthermore\nwithout really understanding these concepts, have tied themselves into\nsuch extraordinary knots that in the end they have been unable to\nextricate themselves except by breaking through everything and\nperpetrating the grossest absurdities. (Letter 12).\n\n\nAs if to emphasize that he is speaking not just of the understanding\nof nature as substance (natura naturans), but also of the\npassive nature of the existing finite modes (natura\nnaturata), Spinoza cites the troubles one gets into as soon as\none attempts to conceive duration through the abstraction of time. The\neternity of the attributes and active nature is to be contrasted with\nthe duration of existing modes. Yet to attempt to understand the\nduration of modes through the abstraction Time, and by implication, to\ntry to understand the spatial extension of modes through Measure and\nNumber, is to employ aids to the imagination only, and inevitably\nleads not to understanding, but to\n absurdities.[17]\n We must conclude that Spinoza's views of Measure, Time and Number\nconfound the easy impression that he thought that the variety in\nmatter could be accounted for by motion and rest considered as\nnumerical quantities. Even if we could satisfy Gabbey's demand for a\n\u201cmathematical account of \u2026 proportions of motion and rest\nand of the measures of motion and rest from which they are\nformed\u201d, that would not meet Spinoza's own demands for the\nintellectual understanding of the nature and existence of bodies.\n\nRelying largely on Spinoza's denial of the divisibility or\nmeasurability of extension as it is properly conceived (as opposed to\nimagined), Alison Peterman (Peterman 2012, 2015) has advanced the bold\nthesis that Spinoza's extension is not spatial or dimensional at all,\nand that, accordingly, Spinoza's bodies do not occupy space. On this\nview, Spinoza means something quite different by\n\u201cextension\u201d than Descartes or anyone else has meant. For\nPeterman, it is not just the apparent divisibility and measurability\nof extension that is an illusion of the imagination, but its very\nspatiality. Peterman argues that spatial extent would necessarily be,\nat least potentially, divisible, and that since Spinoza denies that\nextension is even potentially divisible, he must not understand\nextension as spatial (Peterman 2012, \np. 50).[18]\nShe further supports this\nview by noting that, while Spinoza explicitly characterizes extension\nin spatial terms in his exposition of Descartes' view in the\nPCP, he does not so define extension in expounding his own\nviews in the Ethics, but rather says that extension is\n\u201cconceived through itself\u201d .\n\nPeterman's view has the benefit of helping Spinoza avoid the\ndifficulties of making clear how something genuinely spatial cannot be\ndivided or measured. But this benefit comes at substantial costs. For\none thing, Spinoza is hardly shy in the Ethics about making\nhis heterodox views explicit. If he thought that the wildly heterodox\nclaims that extension is not dimensional and that bodies do not occupy\nspace followed from the indivisibility of extension, and endorsed\nthose claims, one would expect him to have made the inference\nexplicit, rather than leaving it for the reader to draw. Second, the\nview renders Spinoza's philosophy oddly irrelevant to the physical,\nwhich certainly concerns nature as a spatiotemporal domain, and which\nis a preoccupation of everyone with whom Spinoza is in intellectual\ncommerce. Third, and relatedly, even conceding, as one must, that no\nimaginative grasp of extension or bodies can constitute an adequate\nconception of them, if extension is not dimensional and bodies do not\noccupy space, the question arises why we so much as imagine them that\nway, that is, why the ideas of the affections of our bodies are\nimages at all. Leibniz, in the more idealistic phases in\nwhich he denies the ultimate reality of space and time, feels acutely\nthe obligation to explain why spatiotemporal phenomena are\nwell-grounded in what is ultimately real. And Kant, who denies the\nspatiotemporality of things in themselves, goes to great lengths to\nexplain why the phenomenal appearances of these things must be in\nspace and time, and conform to the categories as well. Even if Kant's\nclaim that space and time are the forms of intuition looks like a\nlabel for the problem rather than a genuine explanation, it least it\nis a recognition of the problem. But Spinoza, on Peterman's view,\nequally rejects the reality of space and its apparent occupants, but\nseems to have nothing at all to say about why the appearances are as\nthey are, i.e., imagined. Finally, it is obvious that, on Peterman's\nview, \u201cmotion and rest\u201d, which Spinoza invokes as an\ninfinite mode of extension and in the individuation of bodies, cannot\nhave their ordinary signification of local motion and rest. So she,\nlike others who deny that \u201cmotion and rest\u201d have their\nordinary sense for Spinoza (see section 5.2 above) owes an account of\nwhat they are. But the burden seems even greater for her view, since\nit is quite unclear just what extension might properly be conceived to\nbe, if not dimensional. The only characterizations available seem\npurely negative: not finite, not measurably, not spatial. But what,\nthen? Peterman argues that it is not surprising that the attribute of\nextension should be undefined, since it is \u201cconceived through\nitself\u201d. But to say that something is conceived through itself\nis surely not to say that it is conceived only negatively or in no way\nat all.\n\nFor these reasons, it seems preferable to take the interpretive path\nPeterman considers and rejects, of holding that Spinoza's extension is\nindeed dimensional and his bodies occupants of space, but that\nextension is not really, but only imaginatively, divisible and\nmeasurable. To reconcile the indivisibility of extension and the\nimmeasurability of bodies with the extension's spatiality, we can\nsimply say that one way of conceiving substance is as spatially\nexpended, but that so conceived, it is not divisible, in the sense\nthat it cannot be divided into multiple substances; and we can say\nthat bodies take up space, but cannot be measured, because there is no\nsense to be made of the idea that there is some definite portion of\nthe infinite extension any part thereof occupies, as there would be if\nextension were finite. To conceive  extension through itself\nwould just be to conceive spatiality; this secures the relevance of\nSpinoza's extension to the physical, and likewise provides a ground\nfor the spatiality of appearances in imagination. This preferable\npath, however, takes us no closer to a reconciliation of Spinoza's\nthinking about the physical with the observational, experimental, and\nmathematical character of modern and contemporary physical science.\nIndeed, it seems that, as Schiesser (2017, p. 186) remarks, \u201cit\nis \u2026 a mistake to understand Spinoza as a fellow traveler of\nthe scientific revolution.\u201d\n\nWe saw earlier that there are grounds, though hardly conclusive, for\nsupposing that Spinoza held a fundamental metaphysical view of\nphysical nature that is akin to the contemporary view of the physical\nworld as composed of fields of force, with bodies in some sense being\nconstituted by relatively stable patterns, relative to our own, of\nforce. However, Spinoza's hostility to observation as a source of\nknowledge, his view that experimentation can at best provide examples\nof what we know through reason, and his rejection of the idea that\nphysical nature is to be known through number and measurable\nquantities, suggest that his convergence with contemporary physical\nscience goes no farther than this possible anticipation of the theory\nof fields as fundamental.\n7. Conclusion\n\nIt is far from clear that any thorough and consistent account of\nSpinoza's physical theory can be found. He says too little that is\nfocused and direct, and the various partial and indirect discussions\nof such fundamental topics as inertia and the individuation of bodies\nare individually underdeveloped and problematic, as well as in\nprima facie tension with one another. A few general\ninterpretive strategies present themselves. We might take both his\nclaim that all determinations of extended modes of substance are\nextrinsically caused by other finite modes and his talk of essence and\nconatus seriously. On such a reading, Spinoza tried to develop an\necumenical account of bodies that both conformed to the mechanical\nprinciples of the Cartesian view and preserved the sense that bodies\nare centers of real activity; but his entitlement to that sense is\nhard to square with mechanism and only dubiously earned through the\nappeal to essences. We might, on the other hand, focus on either of\nthe two aspects of Spinoza's thinking about the physical, downplaying\nthe other. Focusing on conatus and essence might enable us to take the\nlatter, properly ethical and psychological half of the Ethics\nat face value, but only at the cost of being debarred from seeing how\nit fits with the mechanical view of the physical world, and those\nfield metaphysical refinements of it that form the basis of modern\nphysics. Focusing on the idea of wholly extrinsic modal determinism,\nwe will see Spinoza as a visionary thinker whose physical theory both\nanticipates and provides a metaphysical basis for contemporary\nphysical views, albeit without their central experimental and perhaps\nquantitative dimensions; but then the ethical and psychological half\nof Spinoza's thought, depending as it does on the idea that\nindividuals, including bodies, are centers of active striving, proper\nto themselves, is cut adrift. Or we might take each aspect seriously\nfor what they are worth in their own domains, seeing Spinoza as both a\nvisionary thinker about the physical and a subtle and original\ntheorist of the psychological, but one whose doctrines cannot be\nsquared with each other, or with the sort of naturalism that sees the\nacting subject as fitting seamlessly into physical nature. But in any\nof these cases, we lose the unity of Spinoza's thought, which was\nclearly of vital importance to him.\n\nIn retrospect, Spinoza's view of physical nature appears as an\nunstable hybrid, perhaps even incoherent. But it of great interest as\na testimony to the striking originality of its author and to the\nunsettled state of play in the open field that was mid-17th\ncentury natural philosophy.\n",
