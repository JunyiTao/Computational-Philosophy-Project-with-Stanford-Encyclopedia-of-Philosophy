    "main_text": "\n\nIn 1933 the Polish logician Alfred Tarski published a paper in which\nhe discussed the criteria that a definition of \u2018true\nsentence\u2019 should meet, and gave examples of several such\ndefinitions for particular formal languages. In 1956 he and his\ncolleague Robert Vaught published a revision of one of the 1933 truth\ndefinitions, to serve as a truth definition for model-theoretic\nlanguages. This entry will simply review the definitions and make no\nattempt to explore the implications of Tarski\u2019s work for\nsemantics (natural language or programming languages) or for the\nphilosophical study of truth. (For those implications, see the entries\non\n truth\n and\n Alfred Tarski.)\n",
