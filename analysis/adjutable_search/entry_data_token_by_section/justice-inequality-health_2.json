    "main_text": "Justice and Domestic Health Inequalities || Health Equity\n6.1 Health Equity\n\nThe concept of health equity is often used to refer to just\ndistributions of health, where health inequities are understood to be\ndifferences or disparities in health that are avoidable, unnecessary,\nand unfair (Whitehead 1992). Health inequalities are\ntherefore in principle observable differences in the health among\nindividuals and groups. Health inequities are health\ninequalities that are unjust. (For discussion of the ways in which\nhealth inequality metrics may themselves be value-laden see King 2016;\nsee Asada 2019 for a good discussion of challenges in measuring health\ninequities).\n\nWhile the concept of health equity is frequently invoked as a\nnormative standard by scholars, policymakers, and public health\npractitioners, there is a good deal of disagreement regarding its\nmeaning. There is disagreement, first, on which health differences are\navoidable. Some suggest that health differences are avoidable\nonly if they are caused by social processes rather than natural or\nbiological processes (Chang 2002; Whitehead 1992). Others argue that\nthis understanding is too constrained (Preda & Voigt 2015; Wilson\n2011). Even if health differences caused by natural processes are not\navoidable in the sense of being preventable, these critics suggest,\nthey may be avoidable in the sense of being treatable. Moreover, if\ninequalities in health are inequitable in part because they are\nunchosen, as luck egalitarians claim, then it makes sense to identify\navoidable health inequalities as those that are amenable to\nintervention (Preda & Voigt 2015: 30).\n\nThere is also disagreement regarding whether avoidability is a\ndistinct and necessary condition of unjust health inequalities. Sudhir\nAnand and Fabienne Peter (2000) suggest that unfairness entails\navoidability and so is not really separate from it. But avoidability\nis cleanly separable (in the other direction) from unfairness, and\nthat can be an analytic advantage. For example, it allows the justice\nof inevitable inequalities in health to be decided without having to\nengage the issue of fairness at all. Others question whether health\ndifferences must be avoidable if they are to count as unjust\n(Lippert-Rasmussen 2013: 59\u201360; Wilson 2011: 216). For luck\negalitarians, health differences due to natural processes can be\nunjust regardless of whether they can be prevented or treated. Even if\nperson A has lesser mobility compared to person B\ndue to a genetic condition that is neither preventable nor treatable,\nthe difference between A and B is unjust and\nA has a claim on society to rectify it, for example, through\nthe provision of a mobility aid or the restructuring of the social\nenvironment. Such inequalities are examples of natural\ninjustices\u2014injustices caused by natural processes\u2014rather\nthan social injustices\u2014injustices caused by social\nprocesses (Lippert-Rasmussen 2013: 59\u201360). (For a contrary view,\nsee Wester 2018).\n\nOne way to save the avoidability condition\u2014understood as\namenability to intervention\u2014is to stipulate that the concept of\nhealth equity is only concerned with social injustices\n(Sreenivasan 2015: 54). But, while luck egalitarianism is\ncontroversial, James Wilson (2011: 216) cautions that it would be a\nmistake to define the concept of health equity in a way that\npresupposes its falsity. Wilson (2011: 217) therefore concludes that\nhealth inequities are simply those health differences that are unjust\n(for an excellent overview of these and other debates regarding the\nconcept of health equity, see M. Smith 2015).\n\nWhile these debates regarding the avoidability condition implicitly\nraise questions of justice, the fairness condition does so explicitly.\nIf the concept of health equity is to function as a defensible\nnormative standard, we need an account of justice in the distribution\nof health.\n",
