    "main_text": "Existence Precedes Essence\n3. Existence Precedes Essence\nThis principle was initially introduced early on in\nHeidegger\u2019s Being and Time when he writes, \u201cThe\n\u2018essence\u2019 of Dasein lies in its existence\u201d (1927\n[1962,\n 42]).[3]\nSartre will later repackage this line with the pithy adage,\n\u201cexistence precedes essence\u201d (1946 [2001, 292]). What this\nstatement suggests is that there is no pre-given or essential nature\nthat determines us, which means that we are always other than\nourselves, that we don\u2019t fully coincide with who we are. We exist\nfor ourselves as self-making or self-defining beings, and we\nare always in the process of making or defining ourselves through the\nsituated choices we make as our lives unfold. This is, according to\nSartre, \u201cthe first principle of existentialism,\u201d and it\n\u201cmeans, first, that man exists, turns up, appears on the scene,\nand, only afterwards, defines himself\u201d (1946 [2001, 292\u20133]). The\npoint here is that there can be no complete or definitive account of\nbeing human because there is nothing that grounds or secures our\nexistence. Existence is fundamentally unsettled and incomplete because\nwe are always projecting forward into possibilities, \u201churling\nourselves toward a future\u201d as we imagine and re-imagine who we\nwill be. Existence, then, is not a static thing; it is a dynamic\nprocess of self-making.\nAcknowledging existence as a self-making process does not mean the\nexistentialist is denying that there are determinate aspects or\n\u201cfacts\u201d about our situation that limit and constrain us.\nThis is our givenness (or \u201cfacticity\u201d), and it includes\naspects of our being such as our embodiment and spatiality, our\ncreaturely appetites and desires, and the socio-historical context we\nfind ourselves in. But what distinguishes us as humans is that we have\nthe capacity to rise above or \u201ctranscend\u201d these facts in\nthe way we relate to, interpret, and make sense of them. If I am\ncompelled by a strong desire for sex, alcohol, or cigarettes, for\ninstance, I do not out of necessity have to act on these desires. I\nhave the freedom to question them and give them meaning, and the\nmeanings I attribute to them shape my choices and the direction my life\nwill take going forward. \nThis means, unlike other organisms, we are self-conscious beings\nwho can surpass our facticity by calling it into question, interpreting\nit in different ways, and making decisions about how to deal with it in\nthe future. This is what Kierkegaard means when he describes existence\nas \u201ca relation that relates to itself\u201d (1849 [1989, 43]).\nExistence is a reflexive or relational tension between\n\u201cfacticity\u201d and \u201ctranscendence,\u201d where we are\nconstrained by our facticity but simultaneously endowed with the\nfreedom to exceed or transcend it. The human being is, as Ortega y\nGasset writes, \u201ca kind of ontological centaur, half immersed in\nnature, half transcending it\u201d (1941, 111). We are not wholly\ndetermined by our nature because our nature is always a question or an\nissue for us. We have the capacity to reflect on and care about it. And\nthe way we care about our nature informs how we create ourselves.\nSartre will go so far as to say that human existence is fundamentally\n\u201cindefinable\u201d and that \u201cthere is no human\nnature\u201d because there is no aspect of our facticity that can\nfully describe us. Our facticity reveals itself to us only through the\nself-defining meanings and values that we give to it. \u201cIf man\n[\u2026] is indefinable, it is because at first he is\nnothing. Only afterward will he be something, and he himself\nwill have made what he will be\u201d (1946 [2001, 293]). This idea\nthat facticity can always be nullified or negated by our choices\nreveals the key to understanding the existentialist conception of\nfreedom.\n",
