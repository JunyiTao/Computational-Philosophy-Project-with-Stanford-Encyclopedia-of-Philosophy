    "main_text": "Practical reason: morality and the primacy of pure practical reason || The primacy of (pure) practical reason\n2.3 The primacy of (pure) practical reason\n\nKant does not give a complete account of the relation between\npractical reason and theoretical reason. However, the second\nCritique does include an important section, \u201cOn the\nprimacy of pure practical reason in its connection with speculative\nreason\u201d (5:119\u2013121). (See Gardner 2006 and Willaschek\n2010.)\n\nWe have already seen two reasons why Kant must give some priority to\n\u201cpure practical reason.\u201d First, assume that Kant is\ncorrect\u2014against rationalist philosophers\u2014that theoretical\nreason cannot have insight into the supersensible. This means that\nreason cannot have access to any transcendent authority (such as God\non many traditional conceptions) that might command thought or\naction.\n\nSecond, Kant says that practical reason can either be\n\u201cpure\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201cproceed from a priori\nprinciples\u201d\u2014or it can proceed \u201cfrom empirical\ndetermining grounds\u201d (5:90). Desires and inclinations are\nempirical, for Kant. Reasoning that helps us fulfill them is\n\u201chypothetical\u201d\u2014it applies only if you have those\ndesires. For Kant, merely following your desires represents\n\u201cheteronomy,\u201d especially when they conflict with morality.\nOn this view, reason is just an instrument to help you\nfulfill your desires. As Hume put it, in an especially horrible\nmetaphor, reason would be \u201cthe slave of the passions\u201d\n(Treatise, 2.3.3.4). It cannot issue its own\n commands.[21]\n\nThese two points suggest that neither theoretical nor instrumental\nreasoning can supply authoritative reasons for action. If there are\nsuch reasons\u2014as Kant\u2019s \u201cfact of reason\u201d\nsupposes\u2014then only pure practical reason can supply\nthem.\n\nNow, however, Kant makes a stronger claim. He argues that pure\npractical reason has \u201cprimacy\u201d even on the home territory\nof theoretical reason. That is, pure practical reason should guide\nsome of our beliefs, as well as our actions.\n\nKant defines primacy as \u201cthe prerogative of the interest of one\ninsofar as the interests of others is subordinated to it\u201d\n(5:119). He gives at least three considerations to support this\n\u201cprerogative\u201d of practical\n reason.[22]\n\nOne point just reflects Kant\u2019s talk of reason\u2019s\n\u201cinterests.\u201d \u201c[A]ll interest,\u201d says Kant,\n\u201cis ultimately practical and even that of speculative reason is\nonly conditional and is complete in practical use alone\u201d\n(5:121). In this sense, to accept the metaphor of\n\u201cinterests\u201d is to see reasoning as ultimately practical.\n(Cf. Kant\u2019s notion of philosophy as \u201cworld-oriented\u201d\nrather than\n \u201cscholastic\u201d\u2014\u00a71.3\n above. See also Neiman 1994: Ch. 3; Kleingeld 1998a; Rauscher\n1998.)\n\nSecond, practical reason can be \u201cpure\u201d or independent from\n\u201cpathological conditions,\u201d that is, our inclinations. As\njust noted, Kant holds that practical reason can be \u201cpure\u201d\nor \u201ca priori.\u201d That is, it\u00a0need not be governed by\nour inclinations.\u00a0By contrast, theoretical reason goes wrong when\nit seeks knowledge by itself\u2014for example, in merely\n\u201cspeculative\u201d proofs that God exists. Theoretical\nreasoning\u00a0can only gain knowledge through sensibility and\nunderstanding. Practical reason is independent in a way that\ntheoretical reasoning can never be.\n\nA third line of thought is less abstract, and rests on the specific\ninterests that Kant attributes to these two forms of reasoning. When\ntheir interests conflict, we must decide which are to come first.\n\nThe \u201cinterest\u201d of theoretical reason consists in expanding\nour knowledge and avoiding error. As Kant has argued, reason can help\nbroaden scientific knowledge, but it cannot justify speculative\nmetaphysical claims. However, practical reason has a conflicting\ninterest\u2014in beliefs that lie beyond the bounds of knowledge.\nKant writes:\n\nBut if pure reason of itself can be and really is practical, as the\nconsciousness of the moral law proves it to be [cf.\n \u00a72.2\n on the \u201cfact of reason\u201d], it is still only one and the\nsame reason which, whether from a theoretical or a practical\nperspective, judges according to a priori principles; it is then clear\nthat, even if from the first [theoretical] perspective its capacity\ndoes not extend to establishing certain propositions affirmatively,\nalthough they do not contradict it, as soon as these same\npropositions belong inseparably to the practical interest of pure\nreason[, then theoretical reason] must accept them. (5:121)\n\n\nIn other words, even if it is finally \u201cone and the same\nreason,\u201d reason seems divided. Used practically, reason has an\ninterest in \u201ccertain propositions\u201d\u2014specifically, the\nreality of freedom, immortality and God. But theoretical reasoning\nsays these cannot be proven. The practical interest has greater\nweight, because it is rooted in morality.\n\nHere, Kant introduces the idea of a \u201cpostulate.\u201d This is\n\u201ca theoretical proposition, though one not demonstrable\nas such, insofar as it is attached inseparably to an a priori\nunconditionally valid practical law\u201d (5:122). For Kant,\nthere is only one unconditional law: the Categorical Imperative or\n\u201cmoral law.\u201d He claims that three postulates are\n\u201cattached\u201d to it: \u201cimmortality, freedom considered\npositively (as the causality of a being insofar as it belongs to the\nintelligible world), and the existence of God\u201d (5:132).\n\nFreedom has a special status\u2014as discussed in\n \u00a72.2,\n the second Critique\u2019s \u201cfact of reason\u201d is\nmeant to establish this. But why does he think we must\n\u201cpostulate\u201d God and\n immortality?[23]\n (See also the entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophy of religion.)\n\nAs we have seen, Kant holds that we should act out of\n\u201crespect\u201d for morality\u2014for the sake of duty.\nMorality must have priority over my inclinations. (Remember:\ninclinations can motivate and explain actions, but\nthey are not enough to justify action.) This means\nthat\u00a0there is no guarantee that acting well will lead to my own\nhappiness, or even other people\u2019s. This creates a\nconflict\u2014in Kant\u2019s terms, a\n\u201cdialectic\u201d\u2014between happiness and morality. While\nmorality is the only unconditional good for human beings,\nKant does not deny that happiness is important. It is the natural and\nnecessary end of every human being (cf. 4:415); duty requires us to\nmake others\u2019 happiness our\n end.[24]\n\nKant expresses the combined importance of morality and happiness as\n\u201cthe highest\n good\u201d:[25]\n\nvirtue (as worthiness to be happy) is the supreme\ncondition of whatever can even seem to us desirable and hence of\nall our pursuit of happiness\u2026 and is therefore the\nsupreme good. But it is not the whole and complete good for\nfinite rational beings; for this, happiness is also required,\nand that not merely in the partial eyes of a person who makes himself\nan end, but even in the judgment of an impartial reason [in other\nwords, this is not about my subjective wish to be happy, but rather an\nobjective judgment that happiness is the natural end for human beings,\njust as goodness is our moral end\u2014GW]\u2026 happiness\ndistributed in exact proportion to morality (as the worth of a person\nand his worthiness to be happy) constitutes the highest good\nof a possible world. (5:110)\n\n\nThe argument here is bold but dubious. We must think of moral activity\nas resulting in happiness. Yet human agency cannot achieve this:\n\u201cI [or even all of us acting together\u2014GW] cannot hope to\nproduce this [highest good] except by the harmony of my will with that\nof a holy and beneficent author of the world\u201d (5:129). So, Kant\nargues, we must \u201cpostulate\u201d that God exists. We must also\npostulate immortality. Only this enables us to hope that we will\nfinally come close to virtue, hence become worthy of happiness.\n",
