    "main_text": "Models of Brahman, God, and the Dao || Models of God\n2.2 Models of God\n\nAs in Vedanta, the extant models of God disagree about the\nultimate-world relation and those disagreements spread them out in a\nrange, with dualisms on one end and monisms on the other, and\npanentheisms and\u2014for the first time in this\nentry\u2014merotheisms in between. The idea of God seems to be\nnothing if not flexible. Even the relatively common view that God is\nby definition a personal ultimate\u2014an ultimate that is conscious\nand self-aware\u2014has been on the move for millennia and is hotly\ndebated today.\n\nThe most venerable model of God that is often read dualistically is\nknown as \u201cperfect being theology\u201d, which bears traces of\nits origin in its name (this is model 8\u2014a general model, species\ncoming). The idea fully grown, as we have it today, defines God as\nthat which is perfect (whether personal or not), where perfection is\ntypically taken to entail being unsurpassable in power, knowledge, and\ngoodness, and several models add being immutable, impassible, a\nse, eternal, simple and necessary in some sense. Most perfect\nbeing theologians take God to have created the universe out of nothing\n(ex nihilo), and that view can be taken to entail dualism for\na variety of reasons. To offer one, as Brian Davies says, \u201cGod\nmakes things to be, but not out of anything\u201d (italics\nhis), including not out of Godself, so the cosmos is entirely fresh\nstuff\u2014a second kind of stuff, distinct from and radically\ndependent on God (2004:\n 3).[36]\n Perfect being theology was birthed during the Hellenistic era from\nthe fusing of the Jewish idea of a single God that acts in history\n(the theos in \u201cperfect being theology\u201d) with the\nGreek philosophical idea of perfect ultimacy (\u201cperfect\n being\u201d).[37]\n From the very start, there were conceptual tensions in the\ncombination: how can the God who led us out of Egypt, who hears our\nprayers and who intervenes in the world as the Jews say (Cohen 1987:\n44) also be immutable, impassible and a se as the Greeks say\n(e.g., Guthrie 1965: 26\u201339, 272\u2013279; Guthrie 1981: 254\u2013263)? This\nquestion is sometimes framed: how can \u201cthe God of Abraham, Isaac\nand Jacob\u201d be the \u201cGod of the philosophers?\u201d Even\nafter perfect being theology had passed for centuries from Judaism to\nChristianity to Islam\u2014with an important handoff in the midst by\nAnselm who amped up the Greek perfection by taking God to be that than\nwhich no greater can be conceived\u2014the great medieval theologians\nin all three faiths were still hitting up against the tensions and\nfinding ways to tamp them down. For instance, on the issue of\nanthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Bible and the Quran, both\nMaimonides and Aquinas read them as negations and said that God\n\u201cis not a body\u201d (Dorff 2013: 113; Kennedy 2013: 158) and\nboth Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and al-Ghazali parted with\n\u201ctheologians who took all these descriptions literally\u201d\nbecause \u201cbeings that have bodily form\u2026have\ncharacteristics incompatible with a perfect being\u201d (Hasan 2013:\n142).\n\nThe tensions continued into the modern era and are still felt in our\ntime. Perhaps as early as 1644, perfect being theology split into two\ncamps over them (see Davies 2004: chapter 1, and Page 2019). Both\ncamps take God to be absolutely perfect, but disagree over what it\ntakes to be perfect: \u201cclassical theists\u201d deny or weaken\nGod\u2019s personhood to save the Greek perfections such as\nimpassibility, immutability and simplicity, while \u201ctheistic\npersonalists\u201d (a species of \u201cneoclassical theists\u201d)\nconversely deny or weaken the Greek perfections to save God\u2019s\npersonhood. \u201cOpen theists\u201d (model 9 in this entry), for\nexample, are theistic personalists: they call for new readings of,\ne.g., omnipotence and omniscience and drop immutability and\nimpassibility to comport with God\u2019s desire \u201cto be in an\nongoing, dynamic relationship with us\u201d (Basinger 2013:\n264\u2013268, see also, e.g., Clark 1992; Pinnock et al. 1994;\nSanders\n 1998).[38]\n Other neoclassical theists aim merely to resolve inconsistencies\namong the perfections, as in Nagasawa\u2019s Maximal God Theism\n(2008, 2017; model 10). In addition to its old challenges, perfect\nbeing theology also hit new ones in the modern era from advances in\nscience. When it met Newtonian mechanics (and more) during the\nEnlightenment, the combination spawned \u201cdeism\u201d, the idea\nthat God set the initial conditions of the universe and then left it\nto play out on its own (model 11). Deism is a dualism because it\nassumes God can leave the world behind and thus is neither\n\u201cin\u201d it as in panentheism nor identical with it as in\npantheism. Picture all these theistic dualisms as close to Dvaita\nVedanta\u2019s image of the eternal builder building a house out of\nsomething different from itself and dwelling in it as it pleases, but\nmake the house not necessarily eternal (it may have had a start and\nmay end), and for classical theism, give the builder all the\nperfections; for neoclassical theisms, give it a few less and perhaps\nhave it throw better parties in the house; and for deism, have the\nbuilder abandon the house altogether once it is built and leave it to\nits own devices, like an \u201cabsentee landlord\u201d (Mitchell\n2008: 169).\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum from these varieties of theistic\ndualism, we find pantheism, the species of monism that takes the One\nto be God (a general model, 13). All monisms face a problem of\nunity: how are the many things in the world integrated enough\nto call them One? But pantheisms face an additional problem of\ndivinity: even if all is truly One, does the One have what it\ntakes to be God? Here we will focus on two contemporary pantheisms,\nboth in Buckareff & Nagasawa (2016): what we might call a\n\u201cone-thing\u201d pantheism by Peter Forrest (2016) (a specific\npantheism, model 14), where the One is a count noun (as in \u201ca\nwalrus is sleeping over there\u201d), so the cosmos as a whole is One\nthing, and a \u201cone-stuff\u201d pantheism by Karl Pfeifer (2016)\nwhere the One is a mass term (as in \u201cthat little lamb is made of\nbutter\u201d), so everything in the cosmos is made of the\nsame kind of One-stuff (model 15). Unlike the Advaita pantheists who\ntake the universe to be a mere appearance, Forrest and Pfeifer\ndefinitely take the universe to exist. So for them (and pantheists\nlike them), the One will have to be identical to the universe, and the\nwork is to show how the universe can be identical to God. In other\nwords, this is not all builder no house as in Advaita; the builder is\nthe house, and the builder-house is special enough to call it\n\u201cGod\u201d. Forrest\u2019s main move to effect this is to take\nthe universe to be a conscious self, by way of a \u201cproperly\nanthropocentric\u201d non-reductive physicalism: just as our brain\nprocesses correlate with our mental states, so also the\nuniverse\u2019s physical processes correlate with universal mental\nstates, which on the model involve a unity of consciousness and thus a\nsense of self. Forrest has a strong reply to the problem of unity\nhere: the One is an integrated Self precisely because of what emerges\nfrom the processes of the many. But is the Self conscious in high\nenough ways to meet the problem of divinity, to count as God? Though\nForrest does not argue like this, the resources for nascent\nperfections are here, such as omnipotence (the Self has all the power\nin the universe), omniscience (It could know the entire universe by\nbiofeedback), good will for all (since to hurt any part of the\nuniverse is to hurt Itself) etc.\u2014enough in theory to count as\nGod in the classical or at least neoclassical sense. For\nPfeifer\u2019s view, instead of picturing the universe as a person,\npicture it as an \u201cintentional field\u201d, like an\nelectromagnetic field except spread physical dispositional states\nacross space instead of magnetic forces and electrons. Because those\nphysical dispositional states have the same extension as intentional\n states,[39]\n intentional states are effectively spread everywhere too. That\nspreading means there is a kind of \u201cpanintentionalism\u201d,\nand if the intentions are divine enough, then a panGodism, i.e.,\npantheism. So if Forrest is right, the universe is God itself, and if\nPfeifer is right, the universe is made of God-stuff, this field of\ndivine intentional states\u2014both strong thoughts. How plausible,\nthough? On the plus side, Forrest\u2019s view is an instance of\n\u201ccosmopsychism\u201d (\u201cthe cosmos as a whole is\nphenomenal\u201d, i.e., the Cosmos as a whole has conscious states)\nand Pfeifer\u2019s an instance of \u201cpanpsychism\u201d\n(\u201ceverything in the cosmos is phenomenal\u201d, every\nparticular in the cosmos is conscious), both of which are receiving\ngrowing attention in philosophy of mind since, e.g., cosmopsychism may\nsolve physicalism\u2019s problem of strong emergence and\npanpsychism\u2019s combination problem at once (Nagasawa 2019, for\nmore on these views and their link with Hinduism and Buddhism see,\ne.g., Shani 2015, Albahari 2019, Mathews 2019). However, even if\neither the cosmo- or panpsychic aspect of Forrest\u2019s or\nPfeifer\u2019s views turns out to be true, the divine part seems\ndoubtful for a reason Pfeifer enunciates: the kind of intentionality\nthe universe would have within it (on Pfeifer\u2019s view) or that\nwould supervene on it (in Forrest\u2019s view) seems likely to be at\nbest the consciousness of an animal, or a comatose or schizoid human,\netc.\u2014not even close to the kind of consciousness that would make\nit count as God (see Pfeifer\u2019s footnote on 2016: 49).\n\nIn the middle, between the theistic dualisms and the pantheisms, stand\nthe merotheisms and the panentheisms (two general kinds of models, 16\nand 17, again, species coming). As indicated above, the merotheisms\nare rare, the \u201codd bird\u201d idea that God is in the world,\nbut the world goes beyond God. Though the term\n\u201cmerotheism\u201d was coined only recently by Paul Draper for\nhis own view (2019: 160), merotheisms have been around well before,\nfor example, in divine emergence theories such as Samuel\nAlexander\u2019s (1920, a specific model 18) on which the world is\nmetaphysically ultimate and God arises in\n it.[40]\n So on the metaphor, the house comes first, then God grows within it.\nAlexander, for instance, thinks the rock-bottom reality is space-time,\nand that when \u201cpatterns\u201d or \u201cgroupings\u201d of it\nbecome complex enough, matter comes to evolve in it, then life, then\nmind and then deity (257). The universe now is at mind, so we are\nwaiting for deity to emerge, not from small \u201cgroupings\u201d of\nthings as with the other levels, but from the universe as a whole.\nBecause things can think only about the things below\nthemselves in the hierarchy, we cannot know what deity will be like\nwhen it comes (Thomas 2016: 258)\u2014a nice way to explain why God\nis ineffable and unknowable, albeit one that gives no (other) content\nto say why Alexander\u2019s \u201cdeity\u201d should count as God.\nIn contrast to the emergence merotheisms, Draper (2019) offers a sheer\n\u201cmeros\u201d one (model 19), in which nature, instead of\ngrowing God, always has God as one proper part. Specifically, nature\nis composed of two parts which are both metaphysically ultimate:\nfundamental matter, and fundamental mind. So what there is not only\nall the familiar material stuff but also one and only one immaterial\nmind, i.e., God\u2014\u201cthe single subject of all phenomenally\nconscious experiences\u201d, located in and coextensive with space\n(2019: 163). Assuming that minds are the source of value, this one\nmind is the fundamental \u201csource of all the value there\nis\u201d, and hence is axiologically ultimate (2019: 163).\nInterestingly, just like prisms immersed in sunlight naturally\ndiffract the electromagnetic spectrum (2019: 167, originally from\nWilliam James), our brains, which are with everything else immersed in\nthis omnipresent universal mind, naturally diffract what we might\nthink of as the divine spectrum\u2014displaying aspects of the\nuniversal consciousness by generating one of its \u201cmultiple\nstreams\u201d, \u201cmaking use\u201d of it for our own ends,\ntuning in to it in mystical experiences, etc. (2019: 163, 170). So\nbrains don\u2019t produce consciousness\u2014they tap into\nit\u2014and God doesn\u2019t make the universe or emerge in\nit\u2014God is the mental part of it that gives it value, and gives\nus a hope for a form of life after death because the consciousness\nthat runs through our brains and that we mistakenly call our own\ncontinues to live on after the brain dies as the aspect of the\nenduring universal consciousness it always was. This hope secures some\nsoteriological ultimacy: though it makes sense to mourn our deaths, we\nshould \u201cnot despair\u201d (2019: 170) since, if we ally\nourselves with our consciousnesses, we are even after death still what\nwe always were, an aspect of the mental fundamental reality, as\nShankara and Ramakrishna and others would tell us.\n\nPanentheistic models of God (on which the world is in God but God goes\nbeyond the world) have been popular for millennia, to the point that\nJohn Cooper calls them \u201cthe other God of the Philosophers\u201d\nin the title of his book on panentheism (Cooper 2006, a general model,\n#20 in this entry). There are literally too many panentheistic models\nof God to count, from a star-studded list of historical thinkers\nincluding Plato, Pseudo-Dionysius, Ibn Arabi, Meister Eckhart,\nNicholas of Cusa, Kant, Hegel, Peirce and more, with a resurgence in\nthe last decade owing at least in part to Yujin Nagasawa and Andrei\nBuckareff\u2019s Pantheism and Panentheism Project (2017\u201319\n [see Other Internet Resources]). Though some complain\nthat the \u201cin\u201d in panentheism is so ambiguous it is not\nobviously a single view (see Gasser 2019), Chad Meister suggests that\nthe recent appeal of panentheism is a direct result of (1) some of the\nneoclassical revisions to the idea of God (more immanent, more\npassible, etc.) which can be explained by the world\u2019s being in\nGod, as well as (2) the advent of emergentist theories in science\nwhich make room not only for the emergence merotheisms sketched above\n(on which God emerges from the world) but also for their converse, the\nemergence panentheisms (on which the world emerges from God), among\nother reasons (Meister 2017: section 4).\n\nHartshorne\u2019s process theology is a great example of the first\nimpulse Meister identifies (so it is a specific panentheism, model\n21). Hartshorne\u2019s process view begins with Whitehead\u2019s\nmetaphysics from Process and Reality\u2014with the idea that\nthe world is dynamic, not static, and indeed that the fundamental\nunits are events, \u201cactual occasions\u201d, not substances,\nwhich\n\n\ndo not endure through a tiny bit of time unchanged but [take] a tiny\nbit of time to become\u2026concrete (\u201cconcresence\u201d, Cobb\n& Griffin 1976: 15)\n\n\nand which are thus dynamic all the way down. Hartshorne then places\nthis dynamic world of events in God, by taking a page from\nRamanuja\u2019s book and saying that all of it\u2014this\n\u201ctotality of individuals as a physical or spatial whole is\nGod\u2019s body, the Soul of which is God\u201d (Hartshorne\n1984: 94, quoted in Meister 2017: section 5, italics added)\u2014a\nmove which cements his view as a panentheism, since the world is\nliterally in God, but God, as Soul of the world, goes beyond the\nworld. The practical pay dirt of the view is that, in the same way we\nfeel our bodies, so also God as the Soul of the world feels the\nworld\u2014feels every last \u201cdrop of experience\u201d as\nWhitehead says, every last bit of change happening in every last\nactual occasion. Moreover, just as we respond to what we feel in our\nbodies, so also God responds to each felt occasion, and in that\ninstant does two things: runs through a catalog of all possible next\noccasions, next moves as it were, and then \u201clures the world\nforward\u201d with suggestions for the best next moves to actualize\nin the next occasion. The world can \u201clisten\u201d or not to\nthese suggestions as the next occasion concresces, and then God will\nregroup again, moment after moment after moment. This is the dynamic\nprocess of perfecting\u2014from the world to God back to the world\nagain\u2014which gives process theology its name, and makes it a kind\nof \u201cbecoming-perfect-being\u201d theology.\n\nJohn Bishop and Ken Perszyk (2016, 2017) propose a panentheism they\ncall a \u201ceuteleological conception of divinity\u201d (model 22\nhere), on which (1) divinity is the property or activity of being the\nsupreme good (\u201ceu\u201d in\n\u201ceuteleological\u201d) and (2) realizing this property or\nactivity is the point (\u201ctelos\u201d or final cause) of\nthe universe. In addition\u2014inspired by an unusual kind of\nefficient causation called \u201caxiarchism\u201d on which final\ncauses can function as efficient ones, an idea visible at least since\nPlato and having something of a revival in the last couple\ndecades\u2014Bishop and Perszyk (3) take concrete realizations of the\nsupreme good to be the efficient cause of the\n universe.[41]\n Thus, on (2) and (3), these realizations of the good are both the\nefficient and final cause of the universe, both alpha and\nomega. This model is, as its authors say, \u201cprone to be\nmet with incomprehension or blank incredulity\u201d (2017: 613): how\ncan effects in the universe be the cause the universe, and thus their\nown causes? Though Bishop and Perszyk do not answer this question in\n2016 or 2017, they do point out the eerie precedent in the Christian\ntradition, the model\u2019s home context, for efficient causes to\ndouble as final ones: Jesus is both the source and offspring of David,\nboth \u201croot and flower;\u201d Mary \u201cgives birth to her own\ncreator;\u201d the Divine word is both \u201cwithout which was not\nanything made that was made\u201d and \u201cborn late in time\u201d\n(2017: 614). They also identify the supreme good in Christianity as\nperfect love, take Jesus to have instantiated it in his person and\ntime and again in relationships, and take us to do so too when we\n\u201clove one another as he has loved us\u201d (2017: 613). Note\nsuch concrete occasions of love are per (1) literally divinity dotting\n(and hopefully eventually overrunning) the universe, and that they\ndeserve to count as divinity because they are triply ultimate:\nmetaphysically since they are the efficient and final cause of the\nuniverse; axiologically since they are the best of things, and\nsoteriologically since they are deeply fulfilling (to quote the\nBeatles, \u201call you need is love\u201d). Whether or not the\naxiarchism at its heart is a strike against euteleological theism, an\nenormous point in its favor is how profoundly it addresses the problem\nof evil: it makes God the force in nature that defuses evil instead of\nintending\n it.[42]\n\nThis section would be incomplete without at least mentioning\nTillich\u2019s \u201cground of being theology\u201d in closing\n(model 23). His view is not filed into the range of God-world\nrelations above because it is famously difficult to categorize:\nChristopher Demuth Rodkey (2013) says Tillich has been read variously\nas a panentheist, deist (i.e., dualist), and pantheist, and that it is\nin fact best to characterize him as none of the above but rather as an\n\u201cecstatic naturalist\u201d, where the Power of Being delivers\nthe naturalism (since this Power is \u201cthe power in every thing\nthat has power\u201d) and the Depth of Being delivers the ecstasy\n(persons experience this Power of Being ecstatically, as holy). This\ninterpretation tracks Tillich\u2019s method of correlative theology\nin Systematic Theology I and II: ecstasy is a \u201cstate of\nmind\u201d which is \u201can exact correlate\u201d to the\n\u201cstate of reality\u201d of the power of being which animates\nand transcends the finite world (see, e.g., Tillich 1957b: 13). So for\nTillich, God is the power or energy that animates the world which,\nwhen truly encountered, provokes ecstatic response. This view is spare\nenough that it is not obvious how someone might work up an\n\u201cultimate concern\u201d about God, another of Tillich\u2019s\ncentral ideas mentioned at the start of this entry (1957a, e.g.,\n10\u201311). Tillich will have to hypothesize that the ecstasy\nprovoked is, for believers, strong enough to rouse such a concern.\n\nThese are, then, several models of God, sorted mainly by how they see\nthe relationship between God and the world. Is the God that is modeled\nin each of these ways metaphysically, axiologically and\nsoteriologically ultimate, in Schellenberg\u2019s terms?\nInterestingly, the answers differ dramatically for each model. To\noffer just two examples, on classical theism we get a yes, yes, yes:\nGod as single-handed origin of the universe, making everything out of\nnothing, is metaphysically the fundamental fact; and, in\nAnselm\u2019s hands, God as the greatest not only actual but also\npossible being in every category of being, is as axiologically\nultimate as anything can be; and in Aquinas\u2019 idea, God as our\nvery telos, the point of our being, is soteriologically\nultimate as well. In contrast, God on Alexander\u2019s view gets a\nno, maybe, maybe. Alexander\u2019s deity is not metaphysically the\nmost fundamental fact in any of the ways collected in the models seen\nso far: it is neither the efficient cause of the universe (as in the\ndualisms), nor its material cause (as in the pantheisms and some\npanentheisms) nor its final cause (as in Bishop and\n Perszyk).[43]\n Alexander also cannot say if deity will be axiologically or\nsoteriologically ultimate when it arrives, since deity is by\ndefinition unknown for him. Thus, God as modeled in some ways is\nultimate and in others is not.\n",
