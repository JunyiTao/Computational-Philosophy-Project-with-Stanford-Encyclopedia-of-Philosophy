The Calm Between the Storms\n\nDuring the next several years, it became evident that Milne\u2019s\nmethods, and kinematic relativity as well, had reached respectability.\nOne important sign of this progress was exhibited at an early 1939\njoint meeting between the Royal Astronomical Society and the Physical\nSociety of London, The meeting had as its goal a thorough review of\nthe situation in cosmology. McVittie was chosen to present the\nobservational situation; his report was soon published (McVittie,\n1939). Reviewing the theoretical situation was George Temple, one of\nthe most highly respected mathematicians of the time. Temple\u2019s\nreport saw print almost immediately (Temple 1939). Within a short\ntime, Temple\u2019s paper took on the role of successor to\nRobertson\u2019s definitive 1933 \u201cRelativistic Cosmology\u201d\n(Robertson 1933b).\n",
