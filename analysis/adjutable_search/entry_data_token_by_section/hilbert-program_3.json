In September 1930,\nKurt G\u00f6del announced his first incompleteness theorem at a\nconference in K\u00f6nigsberg. Von Neumann, who was in the audience,\nimmediately recognized the significance of G\u00f6del\u2019s result\nfor Hilbert\u2019s program. Shortly after the conference he wrote to\nG\u00f6del, telling him that he had found a corollary to\nG\u00f6del\u2019s result. G\u00f6del had found the same result\nalready independently: the second incompleteness theorem, asserting\nthat the system of Principia does not prove the formalization\nof the claim that the system of Principia is consistent\n(provided it is). All the methods of finitary reasoning used in the\nconsistency proofs up till then were believed to be formalizable in\nPrincipia, however. Hence, if the consistency of\nPrincipia were provable by the methods used in\nAckermann\u2019s proofs, it should be possible to formalize this\nproof in Principia; but this is what the second\nincompleteness theorem states is impossible. Bernays also realized the\nimportance of G\u00f6del\u2019s results immediately after he studied\nG\u00f6del\u2019s paper in January 1931, writing to G\u00f6del that\n(under the assumption that finitary reasoning can be formalized in\nPrincipia) the incompleteness theorem shows that a finitary\nconsistency proof of Principia is impossible. Shortly\nthereafter, von Neumann showed that Ackermann\u2019s consistency\nproof is flawed and provided a counterexample to the proposed\n\\(\\varepsilon\\)-substitution procedure (see\n Zach 2003).\n\nIn\n (1936),\n Gentzen published a consistency proof of first-order Peano Arithmetic\n(\\(\\PA\\)). As G\u00f6del had shown was necessary, Gentzen\u2019s\nproof used methods that could not be formalized in \\(\\PA\\) itself,\nnamely, transfinite induction along the ordinal \\(\\varepsilon_0\\).\nGentzen\u2019s work marks the beginning of post-G\u00f6delian proof\ntheory and work on Relativized Hilbert Programs. Proof theory in the\ntradition of Gentzen has analyzed axiomatic systems according to what\nextensions of the finitary standpoint are necessary to prove their\nconsistency. Usually, the consistency strength of systems has been\nmeasured by the system\u2019s proof-theoretic ordinal, i.e.,\nthe ordinal transfinite induction along which suffices to prove\nconsistency. In the case of \\(\\PA\\), that ordinal is\n\\(\\varepsilon_0\\). (For further discussion, see the entries on\n proof theory\n and\n the development of proof theory.)\n",
