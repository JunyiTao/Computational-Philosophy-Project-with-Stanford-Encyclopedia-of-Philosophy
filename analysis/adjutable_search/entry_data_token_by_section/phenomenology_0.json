    "main_text": "What is Phenomenology?\n1. What is Phenomenology?\n\n\nPhenomenology is commonly understood in either of two ways: as a\ndisciplinary field in philosophy, or as a movement in the history of\nphilosophy.\n\n\nThe discipline of phenomenology may be defined initially as the\nstudy of structures of experience, or consciousness. Literally,\nphenomenology is the study of \u201cphenomena\u201d: appearances of things, or\nthings as they appear in our experience, or the ways we experience\nthings, thus the meanings things have in our experience. Phenomenology\nstudies conscious experience as experienced from the subjective or\nfirst person point of view. This field of philosophy is then to be\ndistinguished from, and related to, the other main fields of\nphilosophy: ontology (the study of being or what is), epistemology (the\nstudy of knowledge), logic (the study of valid reasoning), ethics (the\nstudy of right and wrong action), etc.\n\n\nThe historical movement of phenomenology is the philosophical\ntradition launched in the first half of the 20th century by\nEdmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul\nSartre, et al. In that movement, the discipline of\nphenomenology was prized as the proper foundation of all \nphilosophy\u2014as opposed, say, to ethics or metaphysics or epistemology. The\nmethods and characterization of the discipline were widely debated by\nHusserl and his successors, and these debates continue to the present\nday. (The definition of phenomenology offered above will thus be\ndebatable, for example, by Heideggerians, but it remains the starting\npoint in characterizing the discipline.)\n\n\nIn recent philosophy of mind, the term \u201cphenomenology\u201d is often\nrestricted to the characterization of sensory qualities of seeing,\nhearing, etc.: what it is like to have sensations of various kinds.\nHowever, our experience is normally much richer in content than mere\nsensation. Accordingly, in the phenomenological tradition,\nphenomenology is given a much wider range, addressing the meaning\nthings have in our experience, notably, the significance of objects,\nevents, tools, the flow of time, the self, and others, as these things\narise and are experienced in our \u201clife-world\u201d.\n\n\nPhenomenology as a discipline has been central to the tradition of\ncontinental European philosophy throughout the 20th century,\nwhile philosophy of mind has evolved in the Austro-Anglo-American\ntradition of analytic philosophy that developed throughout the\n20th century. Yet the fundamental character of our mental\nactivity is pursued in overlapping ways within these two traditions.\nAccordingly, the perspective on phenomenology drawn in this article\nwill accommodate both traditions. The main concern here will be to\ncharacterize the discipline of phenomenology, in a contemporary\npurview, while also highlighting the historical tradition that brought\nthe discipline into its own.\n\n\nBasically, phenomenology studies the structure of various types of\nexperience ranging from perception, thought, memory, imagination,\nemotion, desire, and volition to bodily awareness, embodied action, and\nsocial activity, including linguistic activity. The structure of these\nforms of experience typically involves what Husserl called\n\u201cintentionality\u201d, that is, the directedness of experience toward things\nin the world, the property of consciousness that it is a consciousness\nof or about something. According to classical Husserlian phenomenology,\nour experience is directed toward\u2014represents or \n\u201cintends\u201d\u2014things only through particular concepts, thoughts,\nideas, images, etc. These make up the meaning or content of a given\nexperience, and are distinct from the things they present or mean.\n\n\nThe basic intentional structure of consciousness, we find in\nreflection or analysis, involves further forms of experience. Thus,\nphenomenology develops a complex account of temporal awareness (within\nthe stream of consciousness), spatial awareness (notably in\nperception), attention (distinguishing focal and marginal or\n\u201chorizonal\u201d awareness), awareness of one\u2019s own experience\n(self-consciousness, in one sense), self-awareness\n(awareness-of-oneself), the self in different roles (as thinking,\nacting, etc.), embodied action (including kinesthetic awareness of\none\u2019s movement), purpose or intention in action (more or less\nexplicit), awareness of other persons (in empathy, intersubjectivity,\ncollectivity), linguistic activity (involving meaning, communication,\nunderstanding others), social interaction (including collective\naction), and everyday activity in our surrounding life-world (in a\nparticular culture).\n\n\nFurthermore, in a different dimension, we find various grounds or\nenabling conditions\u2014conditions of the possibility\u2014of\nintentionality, including embodiment, bodily skills, cultural context,\nlanguage and other social practices, social background, and contextual\naspects of intentional activities. Thus, phenomenology leads from\nconscious experience into conditions that help to give experience its\nintentionality. Traditional phenomenology has focused on subjective,\npractical, and social conditions of experience. Recent philosophy of\nmind, however, has focused especially on the neural substrate of\nexperience, on how conscious experience and mental representation or\nintentionality are grounded in brain activity. It remains a difficult\nquestion how much of these grounds of experience fall within the\nprovince of phenomenology as a discipline. Cultural conditions thus\nseem closer to our experience and to our familiar self-understanding\nthan do the electrochemical workings of our brain, much less our\ndependence on quantum-mechanical states of physical systems to which we\nmay belong. The cautious thing to say is that phenomenology leads in\nsome ways into at least some background conditions of our\nexperience.\n",
