    "main_text": "Arguments in Favor of the Representational Theory of Sensory Qualities || The Argument from Transparency\n3.3 The Argument from Transparency\n\nHarman (1990) offers the transparency argument: We normally \u201csee\nright through\u201d perceptual states to external objects and do not\neven notice that we are in perceptual states; the properties\nwe are aware of in perception are attributed to the objects perceived.\n\u201cLook at a tree and try to turn your attention to intrinsic\nfeatures of your visual experience. I predict you will find that the\nonly features there to turn your attention to will be features of the\npresented tree, including relational features of the tree \u2018from\nhere\u2019\u201d (p. 39). Tye (1995) and Crane (2003) extend this\nargument to bodily sensations such as pain.\n\nThe transparency argument can be extended also to the purely\nhallucinatory case. Suppose you are looking at a real, richly red\ntomato in good light. Suppose also that you then hallucinate a second,\nidentical tomato to the right of the real one. (You may be aware that\nthe second tomato is not real.) Phenomenally, the relevant two sectors\nof your visual field are just the same; the appearances are just the\nsame in structure. The redness involved in the second-tomato\nappearance is exactly the same property as is involved in the first.\nBut if we agree that the redness perceived in the real tomato is just\nthe redness of the tomato itself, then the redness perceived in the\nhallucinated tomato\u2014the red quality involved in the\nsecond-tomato appearance\u2014is just the redness of the hallucinated\ntomato itself.\n\nThe appeal to transparency makes it immensely plausible that visual\nexperience represents external objects and their apparent properties.\nBut as noted above, that weak representationalist thesis is not\nterribly controversial. What the transparency argument as it stands\ndoes not show, but only claims, is that experience has no other\nproperties that pose problems for materialism. The argument needs to\nbe filled out, and typically is filled out by a further appeal to\nintrospection. The obvious additional premises are: (i) If a\nperceptual state has relevant mental properties in addition to its\nrepresentational properties, they are introspectible. But (ii) not\neven the most determined introspection ever reveals any such\nadditional properties.\n\n(ii) is the transparency thesis proper. (Kind (2003) calls it\n\u201cstrong transparency\u201d and usefully distinguishes it from\nweaker claims, such as that we are very hard put to introspect\nadditional properties or that we only rarely or abnormally do.)\nTransparency is vigorously defended by Tye (1995, 2002) and by Crane\n(2003). Dretske (2003) endorses a radical version of it: that we\ncannot introspect anything about a perceptual experience, if\n\u201cintrospect\u201d has its usual meaning of internally attending\nto the experience.\n\nObjections to the transparency thesis typically take the form of\ncounterexamples, mental features of our experiences that can be\nintrospected but allegedly are nonrepresentational. Harman (1990) and\nBlock (1996) speak of \u201cmental paint,\u201d alluding to\nintrospectible intrinsic features of a perceptual representation in\nvirtue of which it represents what it does. Harman precisely denies\nthe existence of mental paint, but Block holds that, in particular, he\ncan introspect the nonintentional, nonfunctional items that he calls\n\u201cqualia\u201d in a sense quite different from that of sensory\nqualities. Loar (2003) grants that vision is normally transparent, but\nargues that we can therapeutically adopt what he calls the\n\u201cperspective of oblique reflection,\u201d perform a certain\nimaginative exercise, and thereby come to detect \u201cqualia\u201d\nin something like Block\u2019s heavily laden sense of that term.\n\nBlock further mentions bodily sensations and moods whose\nrepresentational contents are minimal but which are vividly\nintrospectible. Lycan (1998) argues on similar grounds that the\nqualities inhering in a sensory experience are only part of that\nexperience\u2019s \u201coverall feel\u201d or phenomenal character\nin sense (4). Kriegel (2017) adds that, in particular, sensory\nexperiences have affective components that are part of the mode or\nmanner of representing rather than of the representatum.\n\nTurning back to perception, Block notes that if one\u2019s vision is\nblurry, one can introspect the blurriness as well as the visual\nrepresentata. (More on blurriness in Section 4.5.2 below.) The point\nmay also be made that the vividness of a perception, say of color, can\nbe introspected over and above the sensed content, but Bourget (2017b)\noffers to explain vividness in terms of representata.\n\nA more straightforward objection to transparency is that in perceptual\nexperience, we can introspect the relevant sense modality in addition\nto the content, i.e., whether the representatum is sensed visually,\naurally, olfactorily, or whatever. It may be claimed, as by Lycan\n(1996), that those differences are functional only. However, Tye\n(2002) has maintained that they can be captured in terms of\nrepresentational contents. Moreover, Bourget (2017a) argues in some\ndetail that only by individuating the sense modalities in terms of\ncontents can we give the best account of \u201cmultimodal\u201d or\nmulti-sensory experiences, ones which unify distinct sub-experiences\noccurring in different modalities, such as those of drinking a cup of\ncoffee or encountering a barking dog. (Related arguments had been made\nby Tye (2007) and Speaks (2015).)\n\nFinally, it would seem that for any sensory quality, one can\nintrospect the higher-order property of what it is like to experience\nthat quality (cf. notion (4) listed in the fourth paragraph of this\nentry). Indeed, doing that seems to be one of introspection\u2019s\nstandard tasks.\n\nThese apparent counterexamples take a lot of overcoming. Tye (2003a)\naddresses some of them, arguing in each case that what appears to be a\nnonrepresentational difference between two experiences is actually a\ndifference in representata.\n\nAs representationalism has been defined here, it does not require the\ntransparency thesis. Representationalism itself is a claim only about\nsensory qualities, while transparency is about features of experience\nmore generally. Even if transparency fails and there are\nintrospectible nonrepresentational features of experiences, those\nfeatures are presumably not sensory qualities. (Though some of the\nforegoing examples have also been used against representationalism;\nsee Section 4.) Of course, if representationalism should be construed\nas applying to features of experience more broadly, then the existence\nof some such features may be troublesome for the view so construed;\nbut they may be acceptable to the materialist, e.g., because they are\nfunctional.\n",
