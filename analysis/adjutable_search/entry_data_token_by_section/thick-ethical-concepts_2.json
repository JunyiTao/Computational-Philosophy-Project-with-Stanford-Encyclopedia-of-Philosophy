    "main_text": "Do Thick Concepts Have Distinctive Significance? || The Is-Ought Gap and the Fact-Value Distinction\n2.1 The Is-Ought Gap and the Fact-Value Distinction\n\nIt is common to think that the intuitive contrast between is\nand ought marks an important gap between distinct domains,\nand sometimes this gap is identified as a distinction between\n\u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d. Thick concepts may be\nthought to challenge such dichotomies between facts and values\n(Murdoch 1970; Williams 1985: 140\u20135; Dancy 1995; Putnam 2002:\n34\u201345). To avoid misunderstanding, note that an important gap\ncan be held to exist even if values are a special kind of facts. For\ninstance, according to so-called Hume\u2019s Law, one cannot derive\nan ought from an is (Hume 1739\u201340:\n\u00a73.1.1). Any (non-trivial) valid argument for an evaluative\nconclusion must somehow (perhaps implicitly) involve evaluative\ncontent in its premises. This logical or conceptual barrier can be\ngeneralized to concern various relations of reasonable inference\nbetween the non-evaluative and the evaluative. The underlying thought\nis that evaluative and normative statements commend things and guide\naction, whereas purely non-evaluative statements play no such\npractical role by themselves. The resulting claim that there is no\nreasonable (non-trivial) inference to any evaluative conclusion from\nany set of purely non-evaluative premises is sometimes called\n\u201cthe autonomy of ethics\u201d (Rynin 1957; Prior 1960).\n\nEven if evaluative conclusions that deploy thin terms such as\nright and wrong cannot be derived from purely\nnon-evaluative premises, a conceptual gap between evaluative and\nnon-evaluative statements requires the same to be true also of\nevaluative conclusions that deploy thick terms. Philippa Foot argues\nthat thick terms such as rude undermine the is-ought\ngap: calling something rude is evaluative because it expresses\ncondemnation in the same kind of way as bad and\nwrong do, but this evaluation can be derived from a\nnon-evaluative description (Foot 1958). Consider the following\ninference:\n\nO: x causes offense by indicating lack of respect\n\n\u00a0So,\n\nR: x is rude\n\n\nFoot claims that it would be inconsistent to accept O but deny\nR (Foot 1958: 507\u20139). But then it would seem that a thick\nevaluative claim, namely that x is rude, is an analytic\nconsequence of a purely non-evaluative claim: part of what\nrude means is that anything that causes offense by indicating\nlack of respect is rude. (Foot targets her argument at\nnon-cognitivists such as R.M. Hare, but the issue arises wherever a\nstatement deploying a thick term is counted as evaluative in\nmeaning.)\n\nA common reply is that Foot\u2019s argument yields absurd\nconsequences when applied to thick terms that one regards as\nobjectionable, as embodying values that should be rejected. Many\npeople regard the thick terms chaste and lewd as\nobjectionable because they reject the kind of sexual morality these\nterms are normally used to convey. Atheists are likely to regard\nblasphemous and sinful as objectionable on similar\ngrounds, and a laissez-faire capitalist who thinks that there\nis nothing bad about selfishness may well regard selfish as\nobjectionable in its normal negative use. Whether one regards a\nconcept as objectionable depends on whether the values the concept is\nassociated with are ruled out by one\u2019s own values; a concept is\nin fact objectionable if the values it embodies ought in fact to be\nrejected. Consider now inferences that are identical in form to\nFoot\u2019s but deploy objectionable thick terms:\n\nO*: x is an overt sexual display\n\n\u00a0So,\n\nL: x is lewd\n\n\nIf O analytically entails R and R commits us to a\ncondemnation of its object, then O already commits us to this\nnegative attitude. O* should then likewise commit us to a\nnegative attitude towards its object. But there is no inconsistency in\naccepting that some actions are overt sexual displays and yet refusing\nto condemn anything merely for being an overt sexual display. The\npoint is clearer still if thick claims entail thinner claims to the\neffect that something is good or bad in a certain way.\n\n\nx causes offense by indicating lack of respect.\n\nSo, x is rude.\n\nSo, x is bad in a certain way.\n\nx is an overt sexual display.\n\nSo, x is lewd.\n\nSo, x is bad in a certain way.\n\n\nIf these entailments hold, then, by the transitivity of entailment,\nthe non-evaluative claim \u201cx is an overt sexual\ndisplay\u201d commits anyone who accepts it to the claim that\nx is bad in a certain way. But there is no inconsistency in\naccepting the former and rejecting the latter. What one seems to be at\nmost required to accept is that x is lewd in some\nnon-evaluative sense. The English language might have no other word\nfor expressing that evaluatively neutral sense, but there are various\nways to indicate that one means lewd in that way, such as\nusing scare quotes or a certain tone of voice. Exactly the same should\nthen go for rude. So Foot is mistaken about what\n\u201cx is rude\u201d entails. (This reply is modeled on R.M.\nHare\u2019s reply that Foot\u2019s argument delivers the wrong\nresults for formally identical inferences that involve racial or\nethnic slurs; see Hare 1963: 188\u20139, and also Eklund 2011.\nSubstituting slurs with objectionable thick terms allows us to bracket\nthe issue whether slurs and thick terms are evaluative in the same\nway. Hare\u2019s basic reply to Foot needn\u2019t suppose that they\nare. For discussion, see\n section 4\n of the supplementary document\n \u201cAdditional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance\u201d.)\n\nIt is unclear whether this reply shows that the is-ought\ninferences Foot asks us to consider are invalid. The fact that someone\nwho regards lewd as objectionable refuses to condemn overt\nsexual displays doesn\u2019t show that it is impossible for O*\nto be true while L is false. Perhaps someone who accepts\nO* but refuses to assert L (unless it is clear that she\nis using lewd in an evaluatively neutral sense) is like\nsomeone who refuses to say about prunes what she has already accepted\nabout dried plums (Foot 1958: 509). Refusing to call something a prune\nmakes it no less true that it is a prune. Perhaps the same is true of\nthick terms and the non-evaluative descriptions that Foot claims can\nbe used in their stead. Either way, these complications prompt the\nquestion of how tightly thick and thin terms are connected.\n\nWhether thick terms help undermine the is-ought gap depends\non the way in which thick terms are evaluative. If at least some thick\nterms are such that the sentences in which they figure are entailed by\nnon-evaluative sentences and the evaluations they convey belong to\ntheir meanings or truth-conditions, then thick terms would constitute\ncounterexamples to the is-ought gap. It couldn\u2019t be\nthat O is true but R is false. If thick terms like\nrude have truth-conditional equivalents such as O that\nare evaluatively neutral, the evaluation might attach to rude\nonly as a matter of linguistic convention and not be entailed by the\npropositions that rude is used to express. If the evaluative\ncontents of thick terms were in this way \u201cdetachable\u201d from\nthe propositions they are used to express, they would undermine at\nmost a linguistic is-ought gap at the level of thick terms\nand sentences, but not a conceptual is-ought gap at the level\nof thick concepts and propositions. Another possible view is that\nthick terms aren\u2019t evaluative even by linguistic convention, but\nare merely commonly used evaluatively. Then thick terms couldn\u2019t\nbe invoked to undermine even a linguistic is-ought gap. (Here\nnote a terminological matter. Some who think that evaluation is only\npragmatically associated with terms like courageous or\nrude take this to mean that there are no thick concepts, but\nonly loaded words; see Blackburn 1992 and, on the general phenomenon,\nStevenson 1938. This is what we should say if a thick concept must be\nboth evaluative and descriptive as a matter of meaning. Others who\naccept a pragmatic view are happy to talk about terms or concepts such\nas courageous or rude as thick, using\n\u201cthick\u201d to refer to terms and concepts that\ncharacteristically involve both evaluation and non-evaluative\ndescription in some way or other; see V\u00e4yrynen 2013. This entry\nadopts the latter usage.) This \u201clocation question\u201d\nconcerning how thick terms are related to the evaluations they\nnormally convey is the topic of\n section 4.\n\nThe is-ought gap discussed above is a gap between different\nkinds of representations, whether linguistic or conceptual. This kind\nof gap is what philosophers sometimes have in mind when they\ndistinguish \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cvalues\u201d. But\nsometimes they mean an ontological gap between facts and values or\nevaluative and non-evaluative facts and properties. Even if there is a\nlinguistic or conceptual gap among our evaluative and non-evaluative\nrepresentations, it doesn\u2019t directly follow that there are no\nthick evaluative properties that aren\u2019t separable into distinct\nevaluative and non-evaluative components (Eklund forthcoming). Such\nproperties would violate a sharp ontological distinction between\nvalues and non-evaluative facts. But that debate concerns moral\nmetaphysics rather than thick concepts.\n",
