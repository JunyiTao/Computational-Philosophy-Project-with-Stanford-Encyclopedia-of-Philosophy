    "main_text": "Philosophy of Race\n6. Philosophy of Race\n\nLocke understood race as primarily a product of social culture. Locke\ndenies as do nearly all contemporary race theorists that races are\nbiologically distinct categories of human beings. Locke maintained\nthat culture and race were distinct, but often overlapping categories.\nThere is no tight causal or otherwise necessary connection between\nrace and culture. The two are mutually exclusive even though they do\nsometimes vary together or otherwise correspond. Race, for Locke, is\nnot determinative of culture or civilization. Locke's position on race\ndoes not deny, as some of his contemporaries concerned with the notion\nof race and culture did, that there ever is a significant connection\nbetween racial and cultural factors, nor does it deny that \u201crace\nstands for significant social characters and culture-traits or\nrepresents in given historical contexts characteristic\ndifferentiations of culture-type\u201d (CRASC 188). This is primarily\na cautionary observation on Locke's part seeing as how\n\n[i]t is too early to assume that there is no significant relationship\nbetween race and culture because of the manifestly false and arbitrary\nlinkage which has previously been asserted. (CRASC 189)\n\n\nLocke has some hesitation about the prudence and possibility of\ncompletely eradicating racial categories. He states,\n\n[i]n some revised and reconstructed form, we may anticipate the\ncontinued even if restricted use of these terms as more or less\nnecessary and basic concepts that cannot be eliminated altogether, but\nthat must nevertheless be so safe-guarded in this continued use as not\nto give further currency to the invalidated assumption concerning\nthem. (CRASC 189)\n\n\nLocke attributes the original idea that race is a primary determining\nfactor in culture to the work of Arthur de Gobineau, though he thinks\nthe main scientific justification for the view has been offered by\nthose who seek to interpret culture in evolutionary terms such as the\nsocial evolutionism of Herbert Spencer. Positing a fixed link between\nrace and culture was useful for such theorists in developing a\nstep-by-step account of the development of cultures. But even in\nLocke's day, the supposed scientific foundations of such theoretical\npositions faced challenges. In light of that Locke thinks it\nunderstandable for some to want to correct this misinterpretation of\nthe facts by insisting that there is no connection at all between race\nand culture. We see here again perhaps some of the influence that\npragmatist thinkers, in this case Dewey, may have had on Locke, as\nDewey was apt to point out on numerous occasions the shortcomings of\nSpencer's social Darwinism, and chiefly its attempt to offer a\nuniversal account of all aspects of human development. Locke worried\nthat extreme cultural relativism\n\nleaves an open question as to the association of certain ethnic groups\nwith definite culture traits and culture types under circumstances\nwhere there is evidently a greater persistence of certain strains and\ncharacteristics in their culture than of other factors.\n\n\nIt is \u201c[t]he stability of such factors and their resistance to\ndirect historical modification\u201d Locke thought, which\n\nmarks out the province of that aspect of the problem of race which is\ndistinctly ethnological and which the revised notion of ethnic race\nmust cover. (CRASC 190)\n\n6.1 Theoretical and Scientific Conceptions of Race\n\nLocke postulates three conceptions of race: theoretical or scientific,\npolitical, and social or cultural. Scientific conceptions posit race\nas natural biological kinds. The existence of race and racial\ndifferentiation are explained in terms of biological or ethnological\nfeatures of human populations. Scientific theories frequently assert a\nnatural biological hierarchy between races and aim to explain\ndivergent cultural characteristics of groups though biological\nfactors. Locke argues that genetic inheritance varies both within and\nbetween human populations and cannot be the basis for the sociological\nconcept of race. The factors that create genetic subdivisions of the\nhuman species such as physical and social reproductive isolation\nproduce various consequences (Locke, 1989, 190 \u2013 92 see also\nLocke, 1992, 4\u20136) that may not vary conterminously with the\ngroup\u2019s social history. Genetic subdivisions produce population\nvariances that may not track the social distinctions that a given\nsociety deems salient in terms of group identity.\n\nLocke argues that biological race is an ethnic fiction. (Locke, 1992,\n11 \u2013 12). Putative biological races do not necessarily\ncorrespond with the racialized social identities operative in a given\nsociety. One way race can be an ethnic fiction is when\nnon-biologically determined ethnic or cultural groups are presumed to\nbe real biological populations, when in fact they are not. Locke does\nnot seem to think that this fictitious conception of race undermines\nthe social reality of the phenomenon. On Locke\u2019s view race\namounts to something significant even if many common conceptions of it\nare mistaken. Racialized populations can be comprised from various\ngenetic, cultural and ethnic intermixtures throughout its history.\nIsolating any one of the plurality of factors around which a\npopulation is racialized as the single factor constituting the race\ncan cause a significant divergence between one\u2019s conception of\nracial groups and any underlying reality. Such divergence can inform a\nwhole host of mistaken beliefs and misguided racial practices. Locke\nwrites: \u201c[a]s I pointed out, these groups, from the point of\nview of anthropology, are ethnic fictions. This does not mean that\nthey do not exist, but it can be shown [that these groups do] not have\nas [permanent] designations those very factors upon which they pride\nthemselves. (Locke, 1992, 11)\n\nLocke\u2019s understanding of race is influenced by the ethnology of\nhis time. The notion that racial types are not permanent he derives\nfrom Frantz Boas. (Locke, 1992, 75\u201376) Locke\u2019s belief that\nrace and culture vary independently of each and are thus not causally\nlinked stems from the work of R. H. Lowie. (Locke, 1989, 189\u201390)\nLocke agreed with Sapir that unique cultural or ethnic traits are best\nexplained historically; rather than, biologically or psychologically.\n(Locke, 1989, 190) His reading of Flinders-Petrie\u2019s account of\nassimilative processes initially informed his view of social race, and\nracial differentiation, though these are latter most influenced by his\nconcept of cultural pluralism. (Locke, 1989, 191\u201392) Finally, he\nderives the view that race practices are deeply rooted in imperialism\nfrom Lord Cromer. (Locke, 1992, 64)\n6.2 Political Conceptions of Race\n\nPolitical conceptions of race reject two basic assumptions of\nscientific theories, they reject that races are distinct biologically\ndetermined populations, and secondarily reject that biological\ndifferences of race account for cultural variation, or establish the\nrelative inferiority or superiority of putative race groups. Political\nconceptions of race contend that racism is constitutive of races.\nRacial groups result from political, economic, and social mechanisms\nthat create relative group advantage or disadvantage. Racial\ndifferentiation and hierarchy are the consequences of group exercise\nof political power.\n\nPolitical race, for Locke, is merely favorable or unfavorable social\ninheritance masquerading as genetic ethnic inheritance. Racial\ndifferences and inequalities are caused by these factors, and so, will\nnot account for the duration or amelioration of inequalities and\ndifferentiations. The permanence of racial groups, if it is to be\npromoted, must be based on something other than metaphysical realist\nnotions of race. Conversely, if racial inequalities are to be\neradicated, that too will likely require attention to, and control of,\nfactors and elements of putatively racial groups other than their\nsupposed biological or anthropological similarity.\n\nCharacteristically racial modes of living are wrongly regarded as\nbiologically, rather than, socially inherited. This social inheritance\ncan be either favorable or unfavorable. Locke observes that cultures\nare often racially diverse. Multiple races may share some larger\ncultural elements. (Locke, 1989, 193\u201394) Races are regarded as\n\u201cconcrete culture-types,\u201d according to Locke, which are\n\u201ccomposite racially speaking, and have only an artificial ethnic\nunity, of historical derivation and manufacture.\u201d (Locke, 1989,\n194) Race is a learned epistemic mode of being. A sense of race\nmembership is enculturated and socialized, and once acquired, the race\nsense partly conditions how one perceives and understands the\nworld.\n6.3 Social or Cultural Conceptions of Race\n\nLocke\u2019s social conception of race is a proto-social\nconstructionist account of race. Race, for him, is a\ncultural-historical phenomenon and not a natural kind distinction.\nRace, for Locke, is culture; or conversely, culture is race. The\ncultural conception views race as a learned socially inherited\nphenomenon. Culturally conceived, a race is a transactionally\nconstituted, and inherently transformational, subcultural variant, not\nfixed by biological determinants. Race for Locke is the characteristic\ndifferentiation of culture-type perpetuated through social heredity.\nLocke states that \u201c[r]ace in the vital and basic sense is simply\nand primarily the culture-heredity, and that in its blendings and\ndifferentiations is properly analyzed on the basis of conformity to or\nvariance from culture-type.\u201d (Locke, 1989, 192) Locke\u2019s\nview of social race implies that there are further distinctions to\nmake within current racial categories. Many groups commonly regarded\nas one race constitute several different races.\n\nLocke held that race was in point of fact a social and cultural\ncategory rather than a biological one. For this reason he developed\nthe notion of ethnic race or culture group. By ethnic race, I take\nLocke to mean a peculiar set of psychological and affective responsive\ndispositions, expressed or manifested as cultural traits, socially\ninherited and able to be attributed through historical\ncontextualization to a specifiable group of people. The concept of\nethnic race is a way of preserving the demonstrated distinctiveness of\nvarious groupings of human beings in terms of characteristic traits,\nlifestyles, forms of expression; without resulting to the\nscientifically invalidated notion of biological race.\n\u201cRace,\u201d Locke argues \u201cwould have been regarded as\nprimarily a matter of social [as opposed to biological]\nheredity,\u201d if only the science of his day had reached a more\ntenable understanding of the relationship of race to culture which\nwould likely have resulted from focusing more on the ethnic; rather\nthan, anthropological factors. The distinctiveness of a given race\nwould be understood as the result of \u201cthe selective\npsychological \u201cset\u201d of established cultural\nreactions\u201d (CRASC 191).\n\nThe notion of ethnic race is better able to capture the myriad\ndifferences between culture groups in terms of the actual social,\ncultural and historical conditions that give rise to such variation,\nand without the scientifically indefensible reliance on biological\nfactors. On this view, race is no longer thought to be the progenitor\nof culture; instead race is understood to be a cultural product. Locke\nheld that the more objective analysis of culture he advocated would\nlikely result in the development over time of distinctive\nculture-types for which it may prove possible to work out some\nprinciple of development or evolution. This he thought might\neventually make it possible to develop \u201ca standard of value for\nrelative culture grading\u201d (CRASC 194).\n\nNearly every culture is highly composite; consisting as most due in\nthe union of various social and historical influences; moreover, every\nethnic group in the unique outcome of a specific social history. A\nmore scientific understanding of man replaces the abstract artifice of\nbiological race, and requires that we deal with concrete culture-types\nwhich are frequently complex amalgamations of supposed races united\nprincipally by entrenchment of customary reactions, standardized\npractices, traditional forms of expression and interaction, in sum,\nthe specific history of a given people in a particular place. It is\nnoteworthy and perhaps illuminating of Locke's conception of ethnic or\nsocial race that the groupings of human persons formerly thought to\nconstitute \u201craces\u201d in the biological sense such as\n\u201cNegro,\u201d \u201cCaucasian,\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d\nare in fact each composed of several different social or ethnic races.\nOn Locke's view there are many so-called \u201cNegro,\u201d\n\u201cCaucasian,\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d races. This revised\nunderstanding of culture constitutes in Locke's estimation a\nfundamental paradigm shift in the study of human cultures \u201d[s]o\nconsiderable\u2026[in] emphasis and meaning that at times it does\nseem that the best procedure would be to substitute the term\nrace the term culture group\u201c (CRASC 194).\n\nLocke quickly notes while the notion of race has been invalidated as\nan explanation of culture groups understood as totalities, race does\nhelp to explain various cultural components within a given culture.\n\u201cRace operates as tradition,\u201d Locke noted, \u201cas\npreferred traits and values,\u201d changes in these aspects of\nculture in a distinctive way by a subset of a culture group\nconstitutes \u201cethnic remoulding\u201d (CRASC 195). Race becomes\na term that designates the specific outcome of the \u201cpeculiar\nselective preferences\u201d in favor of some, and against other,\nculture-traits of a given group. \u201cSuch facts\u201d Locke\nobserved\n\nnullify two of the most prevalent popular and scientific fallacies,\nthe ascription of a total culture to any one ethnic strain, and the\ninterpretation of culture in terms of the intrinsic rather than the\nfusion of its various constituent elements. (CRASC 195)\n\n\nTo illustrate Locke\u2019s view consider African Americans, they\nshare a common culture with white Americans in terms of language,\nreligion, aesthetic sense, and many other cultural elements. Even with\nthese cultural elements in common there are characteristic,\nqualitatively distinct, and phenomenologically unique forms that\ncommon language, religion, and aesthetic sense have among African\nAmericans that are not characteristic of white Americans.\nCharacteristic differences such as have produced the musical styles,\nliterary techniques, humor, oratorical idioms, mannerisms, forms of\nworship and religious expression, hair styles etc. and many other\nelements of culture that are the frequent objects of\nappropriation.\n\nA sense of kinship among members of a subcultural group which yields\nan understanding that \u201cdifferent practices [operate in] their\nsociety from those which [operate in other societies and therefore]\ndetermine their treatment of other groups,\u201d Locke argues is a\nkey element in racial differentiation. (Locke, 1992, 20) Racial\nconsciousness is not itself pernicious, but a group\u2019s sense of\nitself and its difference from other social races can be based on the\ndomination and oppression of other groups. (Locke, 1992, 20)\n\nA social group\u2019s sense of itself as a distinctive subculture\nyields the formation of peculiar values and beliefs, alongside\nspecific practices and forms of living. These produce over time\ndistinguishing qualities of the subculture in terms of elements that\nare noticeably present in one, or lacking from other groups. (Locke,\n1989, 194\u201396) Culture-traits\u2014ways of acting, speaking,\ninterrelating, worshipping, eating, expressing etc.\u2014establishes\na dominant and characteristic pattern in a population. This pattern\nconsists of social norms toward which members of the group conform.\nWith sufficient conformity around those norms a culture-type is\neventually established. (Locke, 1989, 194\u201395) Some people\nself-identify in racial terms, but the core elements with which they\nidentify may be illusory. Such identification can benefit a racialized\ngroup. Observing that some racial conceptions are ethnic fictions does\nnot lead Locke to deny the practical utility of racial\nidentification.\n6.4 Race Creeds, Race Practices, Racial Difference and Prejudice\n\nPolitical and social conceptions of race are more useful in explaining\nracial domination and cultural assimilation and pluralism than\nscientific theories of race, which have been thoroughly undermined as\nthe cause of cultural variation. Moreover, the distinctions made, the\nvery populations designated by, anthropological race, rarely if ever\ncoincide with those of ethnic race. The three conceptions carve up the\nworld differently, and of them, Locke finds the political analysis and\nsocial or ethnic conception of race more accurate historically and\nsociologically. This is a matter of some debate in recent work in the\nphilosophy of race. Also, advances in recent decades have raised\nimportant questions about the viability and usefulness of treating\ngenetically discernable populations of human beings as races. Locke\nprovides us further reason to doubt the viability of such projects.\nMoreover, he was adept enough to envision that even in the light of\nsuch advances it is a separate question whether the genetic\npopulations of evolutionary biologists track closely the social\npopulations putatively taken to be races.\n\nPutatively biological conceptions of race, Locke argues, are social\nfictions. This aligns his thinking with fictionalist, or antirealist\naccounts of race, and inclines him in the direction of racial\neliminativism. He argues that theoretical and scientific conceptions\nof race are misguided and ought to be eliminated for metaphysical,\nepistemological and normative reasons. Despite this he regards race as\na fundamental category for understanding human social interactions.\nThis informs his view that political conceptions of race are useful\nfor understanding the way a society\u2019s race creeds can rest on\nfalse beliefs, race practices are misguided and effectuate oppression,\nand understanding of the role of race in advancing imperialism and\ncolonialism. In good pragmatist fashion, Locke is careful not to\ninterpret political conceptions of race as postulating race as a\nmetaphysical reality. His political conception of race offers a model\nfor interpreting and analyzing a society\u2019s racial creeds and\nrace practices, it does not establish that race is a real biological\nor cultural factor of human populations or of individual persons.\nLocke argues that the only viable meaning of race is social. The\nconception of social race is for Locke the only plausible meaning of\nrace. This aligns him with contemporary social constructionist. Locke\nendorses a form of substitutionism by contending that metaphysically\nrealist conceptions of race should be abandoned in favor of ethnic or\nsocial race. His view is reconstructionist in that it aims to correct\nclassical racialist views as well as the prevailing metaphysically\nrealist views of his day.\n\nLocke distinguishes between racial conceptions and a society\u2019s\nrace practices. The social differentiations that produce various\nsocial groupings including races, result on his analysis from social,\npolitical, and economic causes. Locke does not deny that racial\ndifferences or racial prejudices exist. Racial differences, he\nthought, often parallel racial inequalities. (Locke, 1992, 1\u201314)\nLocke claims that \u201c[w]e should expect naturally that race theory\nshould be a philosophy of the dominant group.\u201d (Locke, 1992, 3)\nAs it was in the United States and other European colonial powers\nwhose members proffered racial theories that privileged dominant\ngroups. This leads Locke to argue that much of what has passed for\nrace theory in Western civilizations is \u201cbad science.\u201d\nSpecious justifications of exploitive and oppressive race practices\nabound, and such theories, Locke observes are resistant to correction\nby more accurate scientific investigation, or social scientific or\nhistorical facts.\n\nLocke is doubtful of the prospects of a thorough-going racial\neliminativism. He writes: \u201cI believe that a word and an idea\ncovering so indispensable, useful, and necessary a grouping in human\nsociety will never vanish, never be eradicated, and that the only\npossible way in which a change will come about will be through a\nsubstitution of better meanings for the meanings which are now so\ncurrent under the term.\u201d (Locke, 1992, 84\u201385) This is a\nclear articulation of Locke\u2019s racial substitutionism. He rejects\neliminativism as the appropriate response to problematic conceptions\nof race or pernicious race practices and creeds. But Locke, unlike Du\nBois, is not clearly a racial conservationist. He argues that\nprevailing conceptions of race are illegitimate, present race\npractices are pernicious, and contemporary race creeds unjust.\n\nLocke is arguably a qualified or partial eliminativist as he advocates\na radical redefinition of race in terms of culture, the elimination of\ncertain race practices, race creeds, and race prejudices. Race\nprejudices, Locke claims, are ultimately based on cultural differences\nand differences in the type of civilization. Racial difference is at\nbase a difference in the social consciousness of groups. Race\nprejudice erroneously assigns that variation to biological and\nanthropological factors that are unrelated to racial groups. This\nleaves racial prejudice in the paradoxical situation of being\n\u201can almost instinctive aberration in favor of anthropological\nfactors erected into social distinctions\u201d without any scientific\nwarrant for so doing. (Locke, 1992, 10)\n\nRace prejudices, Locke claims, result from aberrant psychological\npredispositions and tendencies. These habits often function\nunconsciously, but are not exempt from control and amelioration.\nMoreover, race creeds are for Locke distorted conceptual schemes and\nat the root of our notions of racial superiority and inferiority. Race\nprejudice and race creeds can and should be eliminated as features of\nrace practice. His racial eliminativism is partial or qualified\nbecause he advocates jettisoning the more pernicious forms of our race\npractice, and is adamant about substituting current racial conceptions\nfor the view of race as social culture.",
