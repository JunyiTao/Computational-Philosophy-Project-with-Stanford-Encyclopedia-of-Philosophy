    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nA problem being presented to an automated reasoning program consists\nof two main items, namely a statement expressing the particular\nquestion being asked called the problem\u2019s conclusion,\nand a collection of statements expressing all the relevant information\navailable to the program\u2014the problem\u2019s\nassumptions. Solving a problem means proving the conclusion\nfrom the given assumptions by the systematic application of rules of\ndeduction embedded within the reasoning program. The problem solving\nprocess ends when one such proof is found, when the program is able to\ndetect the non-existence of a proof, or when it simply runs out of\nresources.\n",
