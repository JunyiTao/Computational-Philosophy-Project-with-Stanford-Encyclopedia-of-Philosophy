    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Utilitarianism || Act Utilitarianism\n2.7 Act Utilitarianism\n\nSeveral of Mill\u2019s characterizations of utilitarianism endorse\nthe direct utilitarian claim that an action\u2019s moral status is a\nfunction of its utility. Chapter II, we saw, is where Mill purports to\nsay what the doctrine of utilitarianism does and does not say. In the\nopening paragraph, he tells us that utilitarians are \u201cthose who\nstand up for utility as the test of right and wrong\u201d (II 1).\nAccording to the Proportionality Doctrine, introduced in the next\nparagraph, utilitarianism holds \u201cthat actions are right in\nproportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to\nproduce the reverse of happiness\u201d (II 2). Later in that chapter,\nhe says that it requires that \u201cutility or happiness [be]\nconsidered as the directive rule of human conduct\u201d (II 8). Still\nlater in Chapter II, he describes utilitarianism as a \u201cstandard\nof what is right in conduct\u201d (II 17). Even Chapter V, which will\neventually introduce some indirect elements, begins with Mill\nasserting that utilitarianism is \u201cthe doctrine that utility or\nhappiness is the criterion of right and wrong\u201d (V 1).\n",
