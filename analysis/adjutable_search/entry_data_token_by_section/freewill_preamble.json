    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201cfree will\u201d has emerged over the past two\nmillennia as the canonical designator for a significant kind of\ncontrol over one\u2019s actions. Questions concerning the\nnature and existence of this kind of control (e.g., does it require\nand do we have the freedom to do otherwise or the power of\nself-determination?), and what its true significance is (is it\nnecessary for moral responsibility or human dignity?) have been taken\nup in every period of Western philosophy and by many of the most\nimportant philosophical figures, such as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine,\nAquinas, Descartes, and Kant. (We cannot undertake here a review of\nrelated discussions in other philosophical traditions. For a start,\nthe reader may consult Marchal and Wenzel 2017 and Chakrabarti 2017\nfor overviews of thought on free will, broadly construed, in Chinese\nand Indian philosophical traditions, respectively.) In this way, it\nshould be clear that disputes about free will ineluctably involve\ndisputes about metaphysics and ethics. In ferreting out the kind of\ncontrol at stake in free will, we are forced to consider questions\nabout (among others) causation, laws of nature, time, substance,\nontological reduction vs emergence, the relationship of causal and\nreasons-based explanations, the nature of motivation and more\ngenerally of human persons. In assessing the significance of free\nwill, we are forced to consider questions about (among others)\nrightness and wrongness, good and evil, virtue and vice, blame and\npraise, reward and punishment, and desert. The topic of free will also\ngives rise to purely empirical questions that are beginning to be\nexplored in the human sciences: do we have it, and to what degree?\n\nHere is an overview of what follows. In Section 1, we\nacquaint the reader with some central historical contributions to our\nunderstanding of free will. (As nearly every major and minor figure\nhad something to say about it, we cannot begin to cover them all.) As\nwith contributions to many other foundational topics, these ideas are\nnot of \u2018merely historical interest\u2019: present-day\nphilosophers continue to find themselves drawn back to certain\nthinkers as they freshly engage their contemporaries. In Section\n2, we map the complex architecture of the contemporary discussion\nof the nature of free will by dividing it into five subtopics: its\nrelation to moral responsibility; the proper analysis of the freedom\nto do otherwise; a powerful, recent argument that the freedom to do\notherwise (at least in one important sense) is not necessary\nfor moral responsibility; \u2018compatibilist\u2019 accounts of\nsourcehood or self-determination; and \u2018incompatibilist\u2019 or\n\u2018libertarian\u2019 accounts of source and self-determination.\nIn Section 3, we consider arguments from experience, a priori\nreflection, and various scientific findings and theories for and\nagainst the thesis that human beings have free will, along with the\nrelated question of whether it is reasonable to believe that we have\nit. Finally, in Section 4, we survey the long-debated\nquestions involving free will that arise in classical theistic\nmetaphysics.\n",
