    "main_text": "Positive Set Theories || Topological motivation of positive set theory\n7.1 Topological motivation of positive set theory\n\nWe will not attempt an exhaustive survey of positive set theory; our\naim here is to motivate and exhibit the axioms of the strongest system\nof this kind familiar to us, which is the third of the systems of\nclassical set theory which we regard as genuinely mathematically\nserviceable (the other two being ZFC and suitable strong\nextensions of NFU + Infinity + Choice).\n\nA positive formula is a formula which belongs to the smallest\nclass of formulas containing a false statement \\(\\bot\\), all atomic\nmembership and equality formulas and closed under the formation of\nconjunctions, disjunctions, universal and existential quantifications.\nA generalized positive formula is obtained if we allow\nbounded universal and existential quantifications (the\nadditional strength comes from allowing \\((\\forall x \\in A \\mid \\phi)\n\\equiv \\forall x(x \\in A \\rightarrow \\phi)\\); bounded existential\nquantification is positive in any case).\n\nPositive comprehension is motivated superficially by an attack on one\nof the elements of Russell\u2019s paradox (the negation): a positive\nset theory will be expected to support the axiom of extensionality (as\nusual) and the axiom of (generalized) positive comprehension:\nfor any (generalized) positive formula \\(\\phi , \\{x \\mid \\phi \\}\\)\nexists.\n\nWe mention that we are aware that positive comprehension with the\nadditional generalization of positive formulas allowing one to include\nset abstracts \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi \\}\\) (with \\(\\phi\\) generalized\npositive) in generalized positive formulas is consistent, but turns\nout not to be consistent with extensionality. We are not very familiar\nwith this theory, so have no additional comments to make about it; do\nnotice that the translations of formulas with set abstracts in them\ninto first order logic without abstracts are definitely not positive\nin our more restricted sense, and so one may expect some kind of\ntrouble!\n\nThe motivation for the kinds of positive set theory we are familiar\nwith is topological. We are to understand the sets as closed\nsets under some topology. Finite unions and intersections of closed\nsets are closed; this supports the inclusion of \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi \\lor\n\\psi \\}\\) and \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi \\amp \\psi \\}\\) as sets if \\(\\{x \\mid\n\\phi \\}\\) and \\(\\{x \\mid \\psi \\}\\) are sets. Arbitrary intersections\nof closed sets are closed: this supports our adoption of even bounded\nuniversal quantification (if each \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(y)\\}\\) is a set,\nthen \\(\\{x \\mid \\forall y\\phi(y)\\}\\) is the intersection of all of\nthese sets, and so should be closed, and \\(\\{x \\in A \\mid \\forall\ny\\phi(y)\\}\\) is also an intersection of closed sets and so should be\nclosed. The motivation for permitting \\(\\{x \\mid \\exists y\\phi(y)\\}\\)\nwhen each \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(y)\\}\\) exists is more subtle, since infinite\nunions do not as a rule preserve closedness: the idea is that the set\nof pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(\\phi(x, y)\\) is closed, and the\ntopology is such that the projection of a closed set is closed.\nCompactness of the topology suffices. Moreover, we now need to be\naware that formulas with several parameters need to be considered in\nterms of a product topology.\n\nAn additional very powerful principle should be expected to hold in a\ntopological model: for any class \\(C\\) whatsoever (any collection of\nsets), the intersection of all sets which include \\(C\\) as a subclass\nshould be a set. Every class has a set closure.\n\nWe attempt the construction of a model of such a topological theory.\nTo bring out an analogy with Mac Lane set theory and NF, we\ninitially present a model built by collapsing TST in yet\nanother manner.\n\nThe model of TST that we use contains one type 0 object\n\\(u\\). Note that this means that each type is finite. Objects of each\ntype are construed as better and better approximations to the untyped\nobjects of the final set theory. \\(u\\) approximates any set. The type\n\\(n + 1\\) approximant to any set \\(A\\) is intended to be the set of\ntype \\(n\\) approximants of the elements of \\(A\\).\n\nThis means that we should be able to specify when a type \\(n + 2\\) set\n\\(A^{n+2}\\) refines a type \\(n + 1\\) set \\(A^{n+1}\\): each (type \\(n +\n1)\\) element of \\(A^{n+2}\\) should refine a (type \\(n)\\) element of\n\\(A^{n+1}\\), and each element of \\(A^{n+1}\\) should be refined by one\nor more elements of \\(A^{n+2}\\). Along with the information that the\ntype 0 object \\(u\\) refines both of the elements of type 1, this gives\na complete recursive definition of the notion of refinement of a type\n\\(n\\) set by a type \\(n + 1\\) set. Each type \\(n + 1\\) set refines a\nunique type \\(n\\) set but may be refined by many type \\(n + 2\\) sets.\n(The \u201chereditarily finite\u201d sets without \\(u\\) in their\ntransitive closure are refined by just one precisely analogous set at\nthe next higher level.) Define a general relation \\(x \\sim y\\) on all\nelements of the model of set theory as holding when \\(x = y\\) (if they\nare of the same type) or if there is a chain of refinements leading\nfrom the one of \\(x, y\\) of lower type to the one of higher type.\n\nThe objects of our first model of positive set theory are sequences\n\\(s_n\\) with each \\(s_n\\) a type \\(n\\) set and with \\(s_{n+1}\\)\nrefining \\(s_n\\) for each \\(n\\). We say that \\(s \\in t\\) when \\(s_{n}\n\\in t_{n+1}\\) for all \\(n\\). It is straightforward to establish that\nif \\(s_{n} \\in t_{n+1}\\) or \\(s_{n} = t_{n}\\) is false, then \\(s_k \\in\nt_{k+1}\\) or (respectively) \\(s_k = t_k\\) is false for all \\(k \\gt\nn\\). More generally, if \\(s_m \\sim t_n\\) is false, then \\(s_{m+k} \\sim\nt_{n+k}\\) is false for all \\(k \\ge 0\\).\n\nFormulas in the language of the typed theory with \\(\\in\\) and \\(\\sim\\)\nhave a monotonicity property: if \\(\\phi\\) is a generalized positive\nformula and one of its typed versions is false, then any version of\nthe same formula obtained by raising types and refining the values of\nfree variables in the formula will continue to be false. It is not\nhard to see why this will fail to work if negation is allowed.\n\nIt is also not too hard to show that if all typed versions of a\ngeneralized positive formula \\(\\phi\\) in the language of the intended\nmodel (with sequences \\(s\\) appearing as values of free variables\nreplaced by their values at the appropriate types) are true, then the\noriginal formula \\(\\phi\\) is true in the intended model. The one\ndifficulty comes in with existential quantification: the fact that one\nhas a witness to \\((\\exists x.\\phi(x))\\) in each typed version does\nnot immediately give a sequence witnessing this in the intended model.\nThe tree property of \\(\\omega\\) helps here: only finitely many\napproximants to sets exist at each level, so one can at each level\nchoose an approximant refinements of which are used at infinitely many\nhigher levels as witnesses to \\((\\exists x.\\phi(x))\\), then restrict\nattention to refinements of that approximant; in this way one gets not\nan arbitrary sequence of witnesses at various types but a\n\u201cconvergent\u201d sequence (an element of the intended\nmodel).\n\nOne then shows that any generalized positive formula \\(\\phi(x)\\) has\nan extension \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\) by considering the sets of\nwitnesses to \\(\\phi(x)\\) in each type \\(n\\); these sets themselves can\nbe used to construct a convergent sequence (with the proviso that some\napparent elements found at any given stage may need to be discarded;\none defines \\(s_{n+1}\\) as the set of those type \\(n\\) approximants\nwhich not only witness \\(\\phi(x)\\) at the current type \\(n\\) but have\nrefinements which witness \\(\\phi(x)\\) at each subsequent type. The\nsequence of sets \\(s\\) obtained will be an element of the intended\nmodel and have the intended extension.\n\nFinally, for any class of sequences (elements of the intended model)\n\\(C\\), there is a smallest set which contains all elements of\n\\(C\\): let \\(c_{n+1}\\) be the set of terms \\(s_n\\) of sequences \\(s\\)\nbelonging to \\(C\\) at each type \\(n\\) to construct a sequence \\(c\\)\nwhich will have the desired property.\n\nThis theory can be made stronger by indicating how to pass to\ntransfinite typed approximations. The type \\(\\alpha + 1\\)\napproximation to a set will always be the set of type \\(\\alpha\\)\napproximations; if \\(\\lambda\\) is a limit ordinal, the type\n\\(\\lambda\\) approximation will be the sequence \\(\\{s_{\\beta} \\}_{\\beta\n\\lt \\lambda}\\) of approximants to the set at earlier levels (so our\n\u201cintended model\u201d above is the set of type \\(\\omega\\)\napproximations in a larger model).\n\nEverything above will work at any limit stage except the treatment of\nthe existential quantifier. The existential quantifier argument will\nwork if the ordinal stage at which the model is being constructed is a\nweakly compact cardinal. This is a moderately strong large cardinal\nproperty (for an uncountable cardinal): it implies, for example, the\nexistence of proper classes of inaccessibles and of \\(n\\)-Mahlo\ncardinals for each \\(n\\).\n\nSo for each weakly compact cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) (including \\(\\kappa =\n\\omega)\\) the approximants of level \\(\\kappa\\) in the transfinite type\ntheory just outlined make up a model of set theory with\nextensionality, generalized positive comprehension, and the closure\nproperty. We will refer to this model as the\n\u201c\\(\\kappa\\)-hyperuniverse\u201d.\n",
