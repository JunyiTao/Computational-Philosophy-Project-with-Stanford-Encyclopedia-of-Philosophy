    "main_text": "Maximizing Rationality\n6. Consequentialism, Value, and Moral Reason\n\n If maximizing rationality is not the unproblematic requirement of\npractical reason that it initially seemed to be, what are the\nalternatives to it? Let us begin with the assumption that critical\nassessment of an agent\u2019s individual ends is off-limits. This apparent\ntruism has been questioned by some philosophers, who point out that\nmany of our basic aims in life are rather inchoate; people want, for\ninstance, to be successful in their careers, and loyal to their\nfriends, without being clear about what exactly these ends require of\nthem.  To the extent one\u2019s ends are indeterminate in this way, they\nwill not provide effective starting points for instrumental,\nmaximizing, or even satisficing reflection. We need to specify such\nends more precisely before we can begin to think about which means\nthey require us to pursue, or to generate from them a rank-ordering of\npossible outcomes. Here is a possible task for practical reason that\ndoes not fit neatly into the categories of instrumental or maximizing\nreflection, however broadly construed (Kolnai 2001,Wiggins 1987,\nRichardson 1994).\n\n Practical deliberation about ends is not an easy or well-defined\nactivity.  There are no straightforward criteria for success in this\nkind of reflection, and it is often unclear when it has been brought\nto a satisfactory conclusion.  These considerations encourage the\nHumean assumption\u2014especially widespread in the social\nsciences\u2014that there is no reasoning about final ends. On the\nother hand, how is one supposed to clarify one\u2019s largest and most\nimportant ends, if not by reasoning about them in some way? Rather\nthan exclude such reflection because it does not conform to a narrowly\nscientific paradigm of reason, perhaps we should expand our conception\nof practical reason to make room for clarificatory reflection about\nthe ends of action. To do so would be to acknowledge that practical\nreason has an essentially heuristic dimension, one that is connected\nto the project of self-understanding. By working out the meaning and\nimplications of such antecedent commitments as loyalty or success, for\ninstance, we also help to get clear the values that define who we\nreally are (Taylor 1985).\n\n Humean models of practical reason rest on a basically\nconsequentialist account of the relation of action to value. According\nto this account, value inheres ultimately in states of affairs,\ninsofar as it is these that are the objects of subjective preference\nrankings. Actions are then judged rational to the extent they bring\nabout states of affairs that are valuable in this way. It is a matter\nof controversy, however, whether this is the most plausible way of\nthinking about the rationality of action. Defenders of satisficing\nmodels, for example, think that a given action can be rational even\nwhen it is acknowledged by the agent that an alternative action would\nbring about a more valuable state of affairs. Alternatively, it might\nbe maintained that we can judge an action rational without being able\nto arrive at any clear independent ranking of the state of affairs\nproduced by it, as better or worse than the alternatives. Perhaps our\njudgments of the value of actions are ultimately parasitic on our\nconvictions about the what there is reason to do or to admire; in that\ncase, we will not be able to derive conclusions about reasons from\nantecedent premises in the theory of value (Scanlon 1998,\nchap. 2). Related questions have been raised about the basic\nconsequentialist assumption that value attaches in the first instance\nto states of affairs. Thus it may seem to distort our understanding of\nfriendship, for instance, to maintain that what friends value\nfundamentally are states of affairs (involving, say, joint activities\nwith the friend); what people value as friends are rather concrete\nparticulars or relations, such as the persons with whom they are\nbefriended or their relationships with those persons. Building on this\nidea in the theory of value, it has been proposed that actions are\nrational insofar as they succeed in expressing the attitudes that it\nis rational to adopt toward the true bearers of intrinsic value:\npeople, animals, and things (Anderson 1993).\n\nA supposed advantage of this approach is its ability to explain the\nrationality of behaviors that seem intuitively sensible, but that are\nhard to fit into the consequentialist scheme (such as commitments\nderiving from one\u2019s past involvement in an activity or project,\nwhich can look like an irrational weighting of \u2018sunk\ncosts\u2019 to the consequentialist; compare Nozick 1993). But\ndefenders of the consequentialist model contend that we can account in\nterms of it for rational actions that appear to resist treatment in\nconsequentialist terms. For instance, if friends have special,\n\u2018agent-relative\u2019 reasons to attend to the interests of\neach other\u2014and not merely reasons to promote the neutral value\nof friendship wherever it may be instantiated\u2014this can be\nexpressed in consequentialist terms by introducing person-indexed\nvalue functions, which rank possible states of affairs in terms of\ntheir desirability from the agent\u2019s point of view (Sen\n2000).\n\nWhether or not we accept a consequentialist framework, questions in\nthe theory of value would seem to be an important focus for practical\nreflection.  Many philosophers are attracted to the idea that reasons\nfor action are ultimately provided by the values that can be realized\nthrough action (Raz 1999). If this is right, and if we assume as well\na realist or at least non-subjectivist conception of value, then a\ndifferent way of thinking about the task of practical reason comes\ninto view. This may be thought of not primarily as a matter of\nmaximizing the satisfaction of the agent\u2019s given ends, nor of\nspecifying ends that are still inchoate, but rather as the task of\nmapping the landscape of value. This task in turn admits of a number\nof different interpretations.  In the spirit of G. E. Moore, we might\nunderstand the evaluative reflection relevant to deliberation in\nconsequentialist terms, as reflection about a non-natural property of\ngoodness that is instantiated by states of the world; but this is not\na very popular approach today. An influential alternative to it,\ninspired by Aristotle, holds that the proper focus of practical\nreflection is the question of what it would be to act well (Lawrence\n1995, Foot 2001).  According to this view, the values that are\nrelevant to determining what an agent ought to do are those that are\nspecifically connected to human agency, specifying what it would be to\nbe good (or at least non-defective) as a human agent (Thompson 2008,\nThomson 2008).  Those attracted to pluralistic conceptions of the good\ntake a more expansive view, suggesting that any concrete dimension of\nvalue that might be affected by action falls within the purview of\npractical deliberation (Raz 1999, Raz 2011). \n\n\n Morality has provided an especially fertile source of examples and\nproblems for the theory of practical reason. A defining question of\nmoral philosophy is the question of the rational authority of moral\nnorms: to what extent, and under what conditions, do people have\ncompelling reasons to comply with the demands of conventional\nmorality? (Alternatively: to what extent, and under what conditions,\nare people rationally required to comply with those demands?)\nReflection on this question has produced some of the most significant\nand illuminating philosophical work in the theory of practical\nreason. Two divergent tendencies within this body of work can be\nsingled out. Some accounts of moral reasoning proceed by relating it\nto patterns of reflection appropriate to other, non-moral domains,\nparticularly the maximizing patterns canvassed in the section 5. Thus\nit has been argued that, though morality imposes constraints on the\ndirect pursuit of individual utility, these constraints can be\njustified in the terms of ordinary economic rationality; the strategy\nof morally-constrained maximization is recommended on grounds of\nenlightened self-interest, and this in turn accounts for the authority\nof moral considerations to govern the practical reflection of\nindividuals (Gauthier 1986). Other philosophers have tried to make\nsense of morality as a set of rational norms by assimilating it more\ndirectly to the maximizing conception. Consider utilitarianism and\nother consequentialist approaches to the normative structure of\nmorality, which interpret moral rightness in terms of the value of the\nconsequences (of actions, policies, institutions, or other objects of\nmoral assessment). These theories derive at least some of their appeal\nfrom the fact that they apply to the moral domain the maximizing model\nof rationality that seems both familiar and appealing outside of moral\ncontexts. Thus one way to argue for ethical consequentialism is to\nobserve that it is the theory that results when we combine the\nrequirement of maximization with a distinctively moral constraint of\nimpartiality, applying the requirement to a set of preferences that\nincludes those of all the persons (or other sentient creatures)\npotentially affected by our actions (Harsanyi 1982).\n\nOpponents of this kind of ethical consequentialism stress the\ndiscontinuities between moral and non-moral patterns of\nreasoning. They argue that morality is a source of demands (such as\nprohibitions on murder and deception) that cannot be represented\naccurately within the framework of maximizing rationality (for\nexample, Scanlon 1998, chap. 5). If this is correct, then we will be\nable to make sense of moral requirements, as norms that appropriately\ngovern the reflections of individual agents, only if we expand our\nconception of the forms and possibilities of practical reason.\n\nThere are two connected features of moral norms that seem particularly\nsignificant in this connection. First, they are intuitively understood\nto represent agent-relative reasons for action (Nagel 1978). Thus, if\nI have promised that I will take you to the airport tomorrow\nafternoon, this consideration has a significance for me that it does\nnot necessarily have for other agents. In particular, the importance\nto me of keeping my promise seems to be independent from the\nimpersonal end of promissory fidelity. This shows itself in the fact\nthat my reason to keep the promise I have made would be unaffected if\nI found myself in a scenario in which breaking my promise would lead\nfive other agents to keep promises they would otherwise have\nflouted. Second, these agent-relative considerations have a\ndistinctive function within practical deliberation. They are not\nmerely considerations that speak in favor of the actions they\nrecommend, but operate rather as practical requirements that\npresumptively constrain the agent\u2019s activities. The fact that I\nhave promised to take you to the airport tomorrow, for instance, is\nordinarily a decisive basis for concluding that that is to be done. I\ndo not need to weigh this consideration against other values that\nmight be pursued under the circumstances; rather, the promissory\ncommitment enters the deliberative field from the start in the deontic\nguise of an obligation.\n\n\nThere are divergent approaches that have been taken within ethical\ntheory for making sense of these salient features of moral\nreason. Kantians for instance, take rational agents to impose the\nmoral law on themselves when they act, where the law in question\nfunctions as a limiting condition on their pursuit of their ends\n(Korsgaard 1996b, O\u2019Neill 1989). Proponents of virtue theory\ntake it that compliance with some agent-centered requirements is\npartly constitutive of being a good human being (Foot 2001). A still\ndifferent class of approaches understands moral norms in essentially\ninterpersonal terms: either as demands that are imposed by agents on\neach other (Darwall 2009), or as relational requirements that define\nwhat we owe to each other, and that make possible relations of\nmutual recognition or regard (Scanlon 1998, Wallace 2019). These are\nvery disparate ways of conceptualizing morality as a sui genesis\ndomain of agent-centered obligations. They have in common, however, a\ncommitment to the idea that reflection on the nature of morality can\nbring to light structures of practical reason that would not otherwise\nbe salient.\n",
