    "main_text": "Leibniz\n6. Leibniz\n\nThere is a \u2018folk-reading\u2019 of Leibniz that one often finds\neither explicitly or implicitly in the philosophy of physics\nliterature which takes account of only some of his remarks on space\nand motion. For instance, the quantities captured by Earman\u2019s\n(1999) \u2018Leibnizian spacetime\u2019 do not do justice to\nLeibniz\u2019s view of motion (as Earman acknowledges). But it is\nperhaps most obvious in introductory texts (e.g., Huggett 2000).\nAccording to this view, the only quantities of motion are relative\nquantities, relative velocity, acceleration and so on, and all\nrelative motions are equal, so there is no true sense of motion.\nHowever, Leibniz is explicit that other quantities are also\n\u2018real\u2019, and his mechanics implicitly \u2013 but obviously\n\u2013 depends on yet others. The length of this section is a\nmeasure, not so much of the importance of Leibniz\u2019s actual\nviews, but the importance of showing what the prevalent folk view\nleaves out regarding Leibniz\u2019s views on the metaphysics of\nmotion and interpretation of mechanics. (For further elaboration of\nthe following points the reader is referred to the entry on\n Leibniz\u2019s philosophy of physics.)\n\nThat said, we shall also see that no one has yet discovered a fully\nsatisfactory way of reconciling the numerous conflicting things that\nLeibniz says about motion. Some of these tensions can be put down\nsimply to his changing his mind (see Cover and Hartz 1988 or Arthur\n2013 for explications of how Leibniz\u2019s views on space\ndeveloped). However, we will concentrate on the fairly short period in\nthe mid 1680\u201390s during which Leibniz developed his theory of\nmechanics, and was most concerned with its interpretation. We will\nsupplement this discussion with the important remarks that he made in\nhis Correspondence with\n Samuel Clarke\n around 30 years later (1715\u20131716); this discussion is broadly\nin line with the earlier period, and the intervening period is one in\nwhich he turned to other matters, rather than one in which his views\non space were evolving dramatically.\n",
