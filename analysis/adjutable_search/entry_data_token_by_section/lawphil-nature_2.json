    "main_text": "The Methodology of Jurisprudence\n2. The Methodology of Jurisprudence\n\n\nWhen it comes to the methodology of jurisprudence, we find two main\nissues. While one is not directly concerned with normativity, the\nsecond is. The first asks about the aims and success criteria for\nphilosophical theories about the nature of law:\n\n\nWhat is the target that first-order theories of\nlaw aim to capture, and when do they succeed in doing so?\n\n\nThe second asks about the role of evaluation in jurisprudential\nmethodology:\n\n\nAre first-order legal theories inherently or\nnecessarily evaluative or can they be purely descriptive?\n\n\nEach of these questions will be discussed in turn.\n",
