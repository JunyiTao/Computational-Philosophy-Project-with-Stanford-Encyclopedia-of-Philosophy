    "main_text": "Religious Epistemology || The Epistemology of Disagreement\n3.2 The Epistemology of Disagreement\n\nThe terrain covered so far in this entry indicates considerable\ndisagreement over epistemic justification and religious belief. If the\nexperts disagree about such matters, what should non-experts think and\ndo? Or, putting the question to the so-called experts, if you (as a\ntrained inquirer) disagree about the above matters with those whom you\nregard as equally intelligent and sensitive to evidence, should that\nfact alone bring you to modify or even abandon the confidence you hold\nconcerning your own beliefs?\n\nSome philosophers propose that in the case of disagreements among\nepistemic peers, one should seek some kind of account of the\ndisagreement. For example, is there any reason to think that the\nevidence available to you and your peers differs or is conceived of\ndifferently. Perhaps there are ways of explaining, for example, why\nBuddhists may claim not to observe themselves as substantial selves\nexisting over time whereas a non-Buddhist might claim that\nself-observation provides grounds for believing that persons are\nsubstantial, enduring agents (David Lund 2005). The non-Buddhist might\nneed another reason to prefer her framework over the Buddhist one, but\nshe would at least (perhaps) have found a way of accounting for why\nequally reasonable persons would come to different conclusions in the\nface of ostensibly identical evidence.\n\nAssessing the significance of disagreement over religious belief is\nvery different from assessing the significance of disagreement in\ndomains where there are clearer, shared understandings of methodology\nand evidence. For example, if two equally proficient detectives\nexamine the same evidence that Smith murdered Jones, their\ndisagreement should (other things being equal) lead us to modify\nconfidence that Smith is guilty, for the detectives may be presumed to\nuse the same evidence and methods of investigation. But in assessing\nthe disagreements among philosophers over (for example) the coherence\nand plausibility of theism, philosophers today often rely on different\nmethodologies (phenomenology, empiricism, conceptual or linguistic\nanalysis, structural theory, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, and\nso on). But what if a person accepts a given religion as reasonable\nand yet acknowledges that equally reasonable, mature, responsible\ninquirers adopt a different religion incompatible with her own and\nthey all share a similar philosophical methodology? This\nsituation is not an abstract thought experiment. In Christian-Muslim\ndialogue, philosophers often share a common philosophical inheritance\nfrom Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, and a broad range of shared views\nabout the perfection of God/Allah.\n\nOne option would be to adopt an epistemological pluralism, according\nto which persons can be equally well justified in affirming\nincompatible beliefs. This option would seem to provide some grounds\nfor epistemic humility (Audi 2011; Ward 2002, 2014, 2017). In an\nappropriately titled essay, \u201cWhy religious pluralism is not evil\nand is in some respects quite good\u201d, (2018) Robert McKim\npresents reasons why, from a philosophical point of view, it may be\ngood to encourage (and not merely acknowledge) ostensibly equally\nreasonable worldviews. For an overview of the current state of play in\nphilosophy of religion on the topic of religious disagreement, see\n\u201cDisagreement and the Epistemology of Theology\u201d (King\n& Kelly 2017). \n\nAt the end of this section, two observations are also worth noting\nabout epistemic disagreements. First, our beliefs and our confidence\nin the truth of our beliefs may not be under our voluntary control.\nPerhaps you form a belief of the truth of Buddhism based on what you\ntake to be compelling evidence. Even if you are convinced that equally\nintelligent persons do not reach a similar conclusion, that alone may\nnot empower you to deny what seems to you to be compelling. Second, if\nthe disagreement between experts gives you reason to abandon a\nposition, then the very principle you are relying on (one should\nabandon a belief that X if experts disagree about X)\nwould be undermined, for experts disagree about what one should do\nwhen experts disagree. For overviews and explorations of relevant\nphilosophical work in a pluralistic setting, see New Models of\nReligious Understanding (2018) edited by Fiona Ellis and\nRenewing Philosophy of Religion (2017) edited by Paul Draper\nand J.L. Schellenberg. Two other resources are also highly\nrecommended: In God, Knowledge, and the Good, Linda Zagzebski\ncommends the epistemic importance of practicing philosophy in a\ncommunal setting and in On Evidence in Philosophy William\nLycan offers a seasoned view of how to assess the epistemic\ncredibility of arguments by philosophers.\n",
