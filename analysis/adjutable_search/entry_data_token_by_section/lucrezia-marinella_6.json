    "main_text": "The evidence from bodies that the sexes have different natures || Beauty\n5.2 Beauty\n\nThe passionate love men experience for women is excited by the beauty\nof women, and that beauty is the second of the fundamental differences\nMarinella cites between the bodies of women and those of men, as\nevidence of the superiority of women\u2019s souls and ultimately of\nwomen themselves. While temperature is a cause of superiority, beauty\nis a manifestation of the superior character of the souls of women,\nand evidence of the nobility of the idea in the mind of God that is\nthe form of woman: \u201c\u2026the Idea of women is nobler than\nthat of men. This can be seen by their beauty and goodness, which is\nknown to everybody\u201d (1601b, 53). Marinella understands the body\nto manifest the character of the soul, so she believes that we can\nknow that women\u2019s souls are nobler than men\u2019s through\n\u201cthe effect they [the souls] have and from the beauty of their\nbodies,\u201d (55). The beauty is an effect of \u201ca grace or\nsplendor proceeding from the soul as well as from the body,\u201d\n(57). And Marinella states quite explicitly, \u201cThe soul\u2026is\nthe cause and origin of physical beauty,\u201d (58). Taken together,\nthese assertions suggest that the soul bestows grace or beauty on the\nbody, and that those qualities then \u2018proceed\u2019 from the\nbody as well as from the soul. If we accept that the soul is the cause\nof physical beauty, and we assume that effects resemble causes, then\nwe can learn something about the character of the soul from the\ncharacter of the body. To understand how Marinella conceives of\nbeauty, and her philosophical purposes in appealing to beauty as\nevidence of moral and intellectual superiority, we need to consider\nher sources, and also the relation between beauty, heat, and the\nvirtues of women as she contrasts them with the vices of men. We\nshould also notice that she claims on the one hand that all women are\nbeautiful, and that no man is: \u201cI say that compared to women all\nmen are ugly,\u201d (63); and on the other hand, that she allows that\nthere are variations in beauty between individual women, and that men\ncan be more or less beautiful (167).\n\nThe philosophical sources for the view that women\u2019s beauty is a\nsign of a virtuous soul are interpretations of Plato\u2019s dialogue,\nthe Symposium. Ficino\u2019s translation of the\nSymposium was especially influential at the time Marinella\nwas writing, and she does refer to it, but she seems to have based\nmuch of her discussion on Leone Ebreo\u2019s Dialoghi\nd\u2019amore. Two aspects of Platonic theory are pertinent here.\nThe first is the view that particular beings in this world have the\nfeatures they do by means of participation in ideal Forms. So women\nare beautiful because they participate in the Form of the Beautiful\nItself; and their beauty is itself a mark or sign of their\nparticipation. \u201cDivine beauty is\u2026the first and principal\ncause of women\u2019s beauty,\u201d (1601b, 60). The Platonist\nunderstanding of causation allows that while divine being is the first\nand principal cause, there are creaturely causes which mediate the\neffects of that first cause, so that the soul of a woman can be the\nimmediate cause and origin of her physical beauty while divine beauty\nis its first cause. Marinella cites Ebreo for the claim that corporeal\nbeauty is an image of divine beauty, and then argues: \n\n\nIf it [corporeal beauty] came solely from the body, each body would be\nbeautiful, which it is not. Beauty and majesty of body are, therefore,\nborn of superior reason. (1601b, 59)\n\n\nThe second aspect of Platonic theory that serves Marinella\u2019s\nargument from beauty to the superiority of women is the view that\nerotic desire, understood as a response to (and a desire for) beauty,\nis an impulse which leads us ultimately to the Form of Good Itself, by\nmeans of particular good things, which are identified with beautiful\nthings. Agrippa had made a similar argument, which may have influenced\nMarinella. He wrote\n\n\nSince beauty itself is nothing other than the refulgence of the divine\ncountenance and light which is found in things and shines through a\nbeautiful body, women\u2014who reflect the divine\u2014were much\nmore lavishly endowed and furnished with beauty than man (Agrippa\n1529, 50), \n\n\nand adds that \u201call are dazzled by her beauty and love and\nvenerate her on many accounts\u201d (51). Marinella reports that\n\u2018Platonists\u2019 say: \u201cExternal beauty is the image of\ndivine beauty,\u201d (1601b, 58). She agrees with the poets who say\nthat beauty is a path that guides us directly to the contemplation of\ndivine wisdom; and in her own voice asserts that beauty is a golden\nchain, that \u201calways raises us toward God, from whom it is\nderived,\u201d (64\u20135). So the fact that men experience desire\nfor women, because they perceive them as beautiful, is a sign that men\nrecognize that women are good, and indeed better than men. This is\nbecause we desire to possess the good forever, and we do not desire\nwhat we already have. If, then, men desire women it must be that women\nare better than men, and closer to the divine.\n\nMarinella\u2019s own account of beauty is simply this: it is \u201ca\nray of light from the soul that pervades the body in which it finds\nitself,\u201d citing Plotinus as the source. She also cites\nFicino\u2019s letters, and a variety of poets, in support of the view\nthat beauty is a kind of light\u2014or like a ray of light\u2014from\nthe soul, which is compared to the sun. On this account, then, beauty\ndoes not lie in the symmetry of features, or youth, or indeed in any\nmaterial feature of women\u2019s bodies. It is rather an ineffable\naura that pervades womankind. Marinella has support for this view from\nPlatonist philosophers, and indeed from those who oppose her and yet\nallow that \u201cwomen\u2019s lovely faces shine with the grace and\nsplendor of paradise\u201d and she uses it to undermine the claim for\nsuperiority of men. If men were in fact superior to women, then it\nwould be women who desired men, not men who desired women, whereas in\nfact, \n\n\nthey [men] are forced to love them [women] for this beauty, while\nwomen are not forced to love men, because that which is less\nbeautiful, or ugly, is not by nature worthy of being loved\u2026They\n[men] would not be loved by women were it not for our courteous and\nbenign natures, to which it seems discourteous not to love our male\nadmirers a little. (1601b, 63) \n\n\nMarinella thus appears to assert that women do not desire men, but\nexperience only a polite reciprocal affection for those men who love\nthem. This is likely to have been a strategic claim, aimed as a retort\nagainst Passi and other men writing against women, who often accused\nwomen of lasciviousness and promiscuity. Marinella is claiming that\nsexual desire is so foreign to women (at least to most women) that\nthey are incapable of lascivious sentiments or acts.\n\nIf women are beautiful and temperate in their bodies, it is because\ntheir souls are better organized than the souls of men; in particular,\nit is because their desires are obedient to reason. And men are\nsusceptible to woman\u2019s beauty because of the intemperate heat of\nthe male body, which is both produced by the deficiency of the male\nsoul, and a manifestation of that deficiency:\n\n\nI wish to go further and show that men are obliged and forced to love\nwomen, and that women are not obliged to love them back, except merely\nfrom courtesy. I also wish to demonstrate that the beauty of women is\nthe way by which those men who are moderate creatures are able to\nraise themselves to the knowledge and contemplation of the divine\nessence. (1601b, 62) \n\n\nSo Marinella turns the arguments of men\u2014both the argument that\nwomen are defective and colder, and the argument that women are\ndefective and weak of will\u2014to her own purposes, demonstrating\nthat women are better for being cooler, and are less weak of will than\nare men, who succumb to the passionate desire for beauty much more\nreadily than do women.\n",
