    "main_text": "Challenges and Replies || The Clairvoyance Problem\n2.1 The Clairvoyance Problem\n\nOne early challenge to reliabilist theories of justification was\nadvanced by Laurence BonJour (1980), concerning a hypothetical\nclairvoyant named \u201cNorman\u201d. Norman has a perfectly\nreliable clairvoyance faculty. But he has no evidence or reasons for\nor against the general possibility of a clairvoyant power or for or\nagainst his possessing such a power. One day Norman\u2019s\nclairvoyance faculty generates in him a belief that the President is\ncurrently in New York City, but with no accompanying perception-like\nexperience, just the bare belief itself. Intuitively, says BonJour,\nNorman isn\u2019t justified in holding this belief. Yet process\nreliabilism seems to imply otherwise. Since Norman\u2019s clairvoyant\npower has a high truth ratio, Norman\u2019s belief about the\nPresident must be justified. So reliabilism seems to get this wrong.\n(Similar examples were offered by Keith Lehrer (1990) and Alvin\nPlantinga (1993).)\n\nReliabilists have offered various responses to this challenge,\nincluding:\nApproved List Reliabilism\n\nOne response is to opt for a variant of simple process reliabilism,\nwhich goes by the names of \u201ctwo-stage reliabilism\u201d\n(Goldman 1992) or \u201capproved-list reliabilism\u201d (Fricker\n2016). Rather than directly giving an account of what justification\nis, this approach seeks to give a theory of how ordinary people make\njustification attributions. Approved-list reliabilists offer the\nfollowing conjecture about how this works. In a preliminary stage,\nattributors form opinions about the reliability or unreliability of\nassorted belief-forming processes, using observation and/or inference\nto draw conclusions about the track-records of these processes in the\nactual world. They thereby construct mental lists of reliable and\nunreliable processes: lists of approved and disapproved processes\n(respectively). In the second stage, they deploy these lists to make\njudgments about particular beliefs (actual or hypothetical). If\nsomebody\u2019s belief was caused by a process that is on their\napproved list\u2014or strongly resembles one on their approved\nlist\u2014they consider it justified. If it is caused by a process on\ntheir disapproved list, it is classed as unjustified.\n\nHow would approved-list reliabilism explain intuitive judgments in the\nclairvoyance case? Presumably, an ordinary attributor would not have a\nclairvoyance process on either of her lists. But she might well have\nprocesses like extra-sensory-perception or\ntelekinesis on her list, especially her disapproved list. The\nprocess or faculty that Norman uses to arrive at his belief about the\nPresident sounds very similar to one of those obscure and suspect\npowers. Hence, Norman\u2019s belief is intuitively classified as\nunjustified. This is despite the fact that\u2014as potential\nattributors are told\u2014Norman\u2019s clairvoyance process is\nthoroughly reliable.\n\nApproved list reliabilism is a theory of the factors that influence\nour attributions of epistemic justification. It is thus\nnaturally construed as an attributor theory\u2014a theory of\nthe conditions under which a justification attribution (that is, a\nsentence of the form, \u201cS is justified in believing\np\u201d) is judged to be true or false. In this regard, it\nparallels attributor theories of knowledge (e.g., DeRose 1992). There\nare different ways of developing an approved list attributor theory\nmore precisely. For instance, a contextualist implementation might\nhold that a justification attribution is true if and only if the\nsubject\u2019s belief-forming process belongs to the speaker\u2019s\napproved list. Alternatively, one could adopt an assessor-relativist\nimplementation, according to which the truth-conditions of\njustification attributions are relativized to contexts of assessment\n(cf. MacFarlane 2005). An assessor-relativist version of the approved\nlist might hold that a justification attribution is true at a context\nof assessment if and only if the subject\u2019s belief-forming\nprocess belongs to the assessor\u2019s approved list.\nAppealing to Primal Systems\n\nA different response to the clairvoyance problem is to concede that\nbeing the result of a reliable process is not sufficient for a belief\nto be prima facie justified. Rather, some further condition\nmust be met. One version of this approach has been developed by Jack\nLyons (2009, 2011) who argues that in order for a non-inferential\nbelief to be justified, it must be the result of a \u201cprimal\nsystem\u201d. Drawing on research in cognitive science, Lyons\nproposes that a primal system is any cognitive system that meets two\nconditions: (i) it is \u201cinferentially opaque\u201d\u2014that\nis, its outputs are not the result of an introspectively accessible\ntrain of reasoning, (ii) it develops as a result of a combination of\nlearning and innate constraints (2009: 144). For Lyons, our perceptual\nsystems are paradigmatic examples of such primal systems.\n\nHow does this help with the clairvoyance objection? According to\nLyons, BonJour\u2019s presentation of the Norman example invites the\nassumption that Norman\u2019s clairvoyance was the result of some\nrecent development\u2014e.g., \u201ca recent encounter with\nradioactive waste\u201d or a \u201cneurosurgical\nprank\u201d\u2014not the result of some combination of learning and\ninnate constraints (2009: 118\u2013119). Given this assumption,\nNorman\u2019s clairvoyance-based belief is not the result of a primal\nsystem, hence it is not prima facie justified.\n\nA third possible response to the clairvoyance objection\u2014which\ninvolves combining reliabilism with evidentialist elements\u2014will\nbe discussed in\n \u00a74.2\n below.\n",
