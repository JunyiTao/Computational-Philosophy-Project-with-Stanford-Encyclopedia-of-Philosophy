Though\nhe had met Schiller some two years earlier (in 1792), it was at this\ntime that he met Goethe and Herder and over the years became\nacquainted with Friedrich Schlegel and Schelling as well. While\nHumboldt mentions Kant, Schelling, Herder, and Schiller in his\nwritings, it was Goethe to whom he felt the greatest affinity, both in\nterms of personality and interests. As he put it in a letter composed\nsoon after their first encounter in March 1794, \u201che is in fact\nmy favorite here\u201d (JB 254, letter no. 388).\n\nDuring one of his visits, Humboldt undertook a number of experiments\nwith Goethe, which resulted in what has been touted as\nHumboldt\u2019s \u201cmajor work\u201d in morphology, Versuche\n\u00fcber die gereizte Muskel- und Nervenfaser [Essays on the\nIrritability of Muscle and Nerve Fibers] (1797\u20138)\n(Meyer-Abich 1970: 121). Following Goethe, Humboldt employs the notion\nof \u201ctype\u201d to explicate the structure of animal bodies and\nrelations among animal species.\n\nHumboldt went on to dedicate the German edition of\nG\u00e9ographie des Plantes (1805), Ideen zu einer\nGeographie der Pflanzen (1807), to Goethe. The dedication appears\nin a frontispiece based on a sculpture by the Danish artist Bertel\nThorvaldsen. It depicts Orpheus holding a lyre while unveiling the\nstatue of the Egyptian goddess, Isis: the goddess of fertility,\nsymbolizing nature. Sitting at the feet of Isis is Goethe\u2019s 1790\nessay Metamorphose der Pflanzen [The Metamorphosis of\nPlants]. The implication is clear: through his creative\nimagination Goethe, the poet-scientist, was able to reveal nature.\n\n\nAnother important figure in Humboldt\u2019s development during this\nperiod is Friedrich Schiller. In 1794 Schiller invited Humboldt to\nsubmit to his journal, Die Horen. The result was\nHumboldt\u2019s essay, \u201cDie Lebenskraft oder der Rhodische\nGenius: eine Erz\u00e4hlung\u201d (Life Force or the Rhodian\nGenius: A Tale; 1795). Though Humboldt went on to recant the idea of a\nlife force (by 1797, as he claims [DA 5: 325; VN: 265]), he\nrepublishes the essay some thirty years later in the second edition of\nAnsichten der Natur\u2014an indication of his admiration for\nSchiller and his desire to celebrate their connection (DA 5: xi).\nIndeed, it appears that Humboldt had originally planned to dedicate\nIdeen zu einer Geographie der Pflanzen not to Goethe, but to\nSchiller, and only changed his mind after learning of Schiller\u2019s\ndeath (Ette 2018: 225).\n\nHumboldt\u2019s affinity to Schiller\u2019s ideas is perhaps most\nevident in his response to Schiller invitation to write for Die\nHoren. Following a long list of tasks he aims to accomplish,\nHumboldt writes to Schiller, \u201cYou sense with me that there is\nsomething higher to look for, and to find\u201d. This something\nhigher, Humboldt continues, is \u201caesthetic sense and\neducation\u201d, which he connects to \u201ca more expansive\nperspective than that of our contemporary archivers of nature\n[Registratoren der natur]\u201d (JB: 346\u2013347, letter\nno. 238).\n",
