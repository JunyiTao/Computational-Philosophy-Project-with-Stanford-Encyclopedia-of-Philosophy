    "main_text": "Developments in England || Locke\n4.3 Locke\n\nJohn Locke famously makes use of consciousness in his theory of\npersonal identity, separating personal identity from identity of\nsubstance or identity of matter. This is a purely psychological\naccount of identity, which has implications for judgments of moral\nresponsibility (which Locke does develop), but consciousness\nitself is not to be equated with the moral sensibility. \n\nLocke\u2019s definition of \u201cperson\u201d contains in it a\ndefinition of consciousness:\n\n\n[A person] is a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason\nand reflection, and can consider it self as it self, the same thinking\nthing in different times and places; which it does only by that\nconsciousness, which is inseparable from thinking, and as it seems to\nme essential to it: It being impossible for any one to perceive,\nwithout perceiving, that he does perceive. (Essay 2.27.9)\n\n\nHere again we find commitments to the transparency of the mental and\nconnections between consciousness and reflection. The identification\nof consciousness with \u201cperceiving that [one] does\nperceive\u201d raises again the specter of the higher-order\n interpretation.[12]\n But there are good reasons to think that a higher-order theory\nwon\u2019t work for Locke (see Coventry and Kriegel 2008 and Weinberg\n2008). In just about every section of this entry, we have encountered\nsomeone as interpreting the relevant philosopher as a\nhigher-order theorist. But repeatedly this suggestion is countered\nexplicitly by the philosopher himself or implicitly by an obvious\nincoherence with other basic principles. One might hope that the\nfrequent objections in the literature will put an end to such\n speculations.[13]\n While expressions of accounts of consciousness in the seventeenth\ncentury might sound a lot like today\u2019s higher-order theories of\nconsciousness, there are almost always alternative ways of construing\nthe accounts that are more faithful to what\u2019s going on at the\ntime.\n\nRather, in Locke\u2019s case, it seems that the analysis of\nconsciousness allows only the inference that thoughts are\nself-intimating. \u201cWhen we see, hear, smell, taste,\nfeel, meditate, or will any thing, we know that we do so\u201d\n(2.27.9). And yet there has been a long history arguing that Locke\nequates consciousness and reflection (for this history of this\ninterpretation, see Kulstad 84\u201385). Of course, even if\nLocke\u2019s account of consciousness necessarily involves\nreflection, we have seen that this doesn\u2019t immediately entail a\nhigher-order theory. But, as Mark Kulstad argues, there is good reason\nto think that Locke distinguishes consciousness from reflection. One\ncan be conscious of something (namely, a sensible quality) without\nthereby reflecting on it (Kulstad\n 87\u201391).[14]\n\n\nFurther, like Descartes, Locke argues that this is the essence of\nthought\u2014one can\u2019t have a thought without \u201cbeing\nconscious of it\u201d (2.1.19). However, he will extend this idea\nonly as far as experience will allow\u2014it is not at all clear to\nhim that \u201cthe soul always thinks,\u201d since we often fail to\nhave conscious experience while asleep. And so, as Locke says,\n\u201cevery drowsy nod shakes their doctrine, who teach that the soul\nis always thinking\u201d (2.1.13; see 2.1.10\u201320 for the full\nargument). This argument resembles that offered by Cudworth, and, like\nCudworth, Locke will conclude that thinking is not the essence of the\nsoul. The soul can persist through a state in which there is no\nthinking\u2014this is the beginning of his separation of the\nunderlying substance from its psychological states. The consciousness\nof an individual bears no necessary relation to the substance it\ninheres in, and so the substance contributes nothing to the identity\nof the individual. \n\nShelley Weinberg has argued for an interpretation of Locke\u2019s\ntheory of consciousness that she thinks solves many of the most\npressing problems of interpretation. According to Weinberg, for Locke,\n\n\n\nConsciousness is self-consciousness. It is a non-evaluative\nself-referential form of awareness internal to all perceptions of\nideas. It is the perception that I am perceiving an idea, or the\nperception of myself as perceiving an idea. (xi)\n\n She takes Locke\u2019s account to entail that every act of\nperception is a complex state involving \u201dat the very least, an\nact of perception, an idea perceived, and consciousness (that I am\nperceiving)\u201c (xi).  Her defense of this view shows how such an\naccount of consciousness helps make sense of Locke\u2019s claims\nabout the knowledge of one\u2019s own existence, the knowledge of\nexternal objects, personal identity, and moral agency (Weinberg\n2016).\n",
