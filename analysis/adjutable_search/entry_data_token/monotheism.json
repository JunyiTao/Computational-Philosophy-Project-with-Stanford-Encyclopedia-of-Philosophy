Monotheism\u2019s Origins\n\n\nMost mainstream Old Testament scholars believe that the religion of\nthe early Israelites was neither monotheistic nor polytheistic but\n\u201cmonolatrous.\u201d While the existence of other gods was not\ndenied, Israel was to worship no god but Yahweh. In virtue of the\nMosaic covenant, Yahweh became the \u201cconfederate god\u201d of\nIsrael, and they become his people (Meek, 215). In part, this is\ncharacteristic of any \u201cnational religion: in practice only the\ngods of one\u2019s own nation are significant.\u201d Yet it was also\nunique, for \u201cone of the distinguishing characteristics of the\nIsraelite religion is the belief that there are not several gods of\nIsrael but only one, Yahweh, who claims exclusive devotion.\u201d\n(Ringgren, 67) There are no unambiguous assertions of monotheism from\nthe pre-exilic period, however. Even so, biblical scholars agree that\nthe religion of Israel was at least \u201cincipiently\u201d\nmonotheistic from its Mosaic beginnings. Why? Three things were\narguably decisive.\n\n\nIn the first place, \u201cwe encounter very early the idea that\nYahweh is the creator of heaven and earth.\u201d (Ringgren, 67).\nAlthough it is true that polytheistic religions frequently include a\ncreator in their pantheons, and these creators are often comparatively\nunimportant, there is a natural transition from the claim that a god\nhas created heaven and earth to the belief that he or she is\nlord of heaven and earth, and from there to monotheism. In the\nsecond place, there are \u201crepeated affirmations \u2026 that\nYahweh is the greatest and mightiest of the gods.\u201d (Ringgren, 99)\nFinally, the religion of Israel is unique in demanding exclusive\nworship; only Yahweh is to be worshiped by Israel. The extension of\nthis notion to the idea that Yahweh alone is to be worshiped by\neveryone is natural (although perhaps not inevitable). If\nthese considerations are correct, then the characteristics of Yahweh\nthat eventually led Israel to assert that Yahweh is the only God were\nhis creation of heaven and earth, his power and greatness, and his\nright to exclusive worship.\n\n\nParallel developments occurred elsewhere. Especially noteworthy is a\nphenomenon that sometimes occurs in polytheism, namely, that during\nworship the god is treated as if he or she were unlimited and supreme,\nand given epithets that properly belong to other members of the\npantheon. (This occurred at certain stages of Vedic polytheism, for\nexample.) More generally, the religious attitudes bound up with\ntheistic worship (whether monotheistic or polytheistic) appear\nto have a certain inner logic, tending to lead the devotee to magnify\nthe object of her devotion by denying limitations and adding\nperfections. The logical limit of this tendency is the ascription of\nsuch properties as universal sovereignty and unlimited power. The very\nsame attitudes also tend to lead her to unreservedly commit herself to,\nand center her life on, the god to whom she is devoted. It is therefore\nno accident that polytheistic systems often end up elevating one god or\nprinciple to the supreme position, and reinterpreting the others as its\nagents or manifestations; they become, in other words, essentially\nmonotheistic. This occurred, for example, both in late Paganism and in\nHinduism.\n\n\nA striking feature of these developments is that the ideas about the\nobject of worship which seem to have most directly led its devotees to\nexplicit affirmations of monotheism\u2014universal sovereignty,\nomnipotence, and a demand for total devotion\u2014are precisely\nthose underlying the three most powerful philosophical arguments for\nGod\u2019s unicity. We will discuss these shortly. But before doing so let\nus examine two historically important attempts to show that there can\u2019t\nbe two gods because nothing could distinguish them\u2014an argument\nfrom God\u2019s simplicity and another from his perfection.\n2. An Argument from God\u2019s Simplicity\n\n\nGod is often thought to be simple in the sense that each of God\u2019s\nreal properties is identical with each of his other real properties,\nand with his being or nature. For example, God\u2019s knowledge is identical\nwith his power, and both are identical with his being. Just as\n\u201cthe teacher of Plato\u201d and \u201cthe husband of\nXanthippe\u201d don\u2019t mean the same yet refer to the same individual\n(namely, Socrates), so \u201cthe wisdom of God\u201d and \u201cthe\npower of God\u201d have different meanings but refer to the same thing\n(namely, the infinitely perfect divine life or activity). If God\nis simple, however, it seems that there can be only one\ngod.\n\n\nFor consider the following argument. Suppose that there are two\nsimple beings, x and y. x has the property\nof simplicity, S, and whatever property, P, suffices\nfor identity with x. And because x is simple,\nS=P. But y, too has S. y\nmust therefore have P as well and, hence,\ny=x (Leftow, 199\u2013200).\n\n\nNotice, however, that God\u2019s simplicity is a second-order\nproperty, that is, a property of God\u2019s first-order properties such as\nwisdom, power, goodness, and the like. The doctrine of simplicity\nmay entail that God\u2019s (real) first-order properties are\nidentical. But does it entail that all of God\u2019s (real)\nsecond-order properties are identical with his (real) first order\nproperties (and thus that God\u2019s simplicity is identical with whatever\nfirst-order properties suffice for identity with God)? It isn\u2019t clear\nthat it does. Since simplicity and other divine second-order\nproperties supervene on his first-order properties, the latter entail\nthe former; nothing could instantiate each of God\u2019s (real) first-order\nproperties without instantiating such properties as simplicity. But the\nconverse may not be true. For couldn\u2019t a thing be simple in the defined\nsense (namely, having all its first-order real properties identical\nwith each other and with its being) without having the divine\nproperties? (Numbers might be an example.) If it could, then simplicity\nis not identical with the real first-order properties that suffice to\nmake God God.\n\n\nWe needn\u2019t suppose that God\u2019s second-order properties are identical\nwith his first-order properties to mount an argument from simplicity,\nhowever. Suppose that God is simple in the sense that, for any two of\nhis first-order properties, P and Q, either\nP is identical with Q or P is logically\nequivalent to Q (that is, it is impossible for him to possess\nP without possessing Q, and vice versa). Let us also\nsuppose that there are two gods. If both are God, then both possess the\nfirst-order properties essential to divinity. Call these D. If\nthe two differ, each possesses at least one first-order property which\nthe other lacks. Suppose, for example, that the first possesses a\nfirst-order property, H, and the second possesses its\ncomplement, non-H. Since each is God, each is simple. Hence,\neither H is identical with D and non-H is\nidentical with D, or H is logically equivalent to\nD and non-H is logically equivalent to D.\nTherefore, either H is identical with non-H or\nH is logically equivalent to non-H. But this is\nincoherent and, even if it were not, the possession of H and\nnon-H could not be used to distinguish the two, since either\nH and non-H are the same property or H and\nnon-H are logically equivalent properties. It therefore seems\nthat if God is simple, there can\u2019t be two gods.\n\n\nThere are at least two problems with this argument, though. First,\nthe doctrine of divine simplicity is highly controversial\u2014not\nall theists accept it. Second, even if the doctrine is accepted, the\nmost that may be required is that God\u2019s essential (real)\nproperties are either identical with each other or equivalent to each\nother. God also appears to have (real) contingent properties, however,\nand, if he does, these properties can\u2019t be identical with or equivalent\nto his essential properties. For consider the property of being the\nultimate cause of my existence or the property of knowing that I am the\nauthor of this entry. Since acting and knowing are paradigmatic cases\nof real properties, being the ultimate cause of my existence or knowing\nthat I am the author of this entry would seem to be real properties of\nGod. (Pace Thomas Aquinas and others who implausibly insist that they\naren\u2019t even though God really has them, that is, even though God really\ndoes stand in these relations to me.) But they are also\ncontingent properties of God, since there are possible worlds\nin which God exists and doesn\u2019t create me, and possible worlds in which\nGod exists but doesn\u2019t know that I am the author of this entry\n(because, for example, I never write it). Since God has his essential\nproperties in every possible world in which he exists and does not have\nhis contingent properties in every possible world in which he exists,\nhis contingent properties can\u2019t be identical with, or equivalent to,\nhis essential properties. It follows that if H and non-H are real but\ncontingent properties of two divine beings, they are neither identical\nwith nor equivalent to D. The argument from simplicity thus fails\nbecause it leaves open the possibility that two gods could be\ndistinguished by a difference in their real contingent properties.\n3. An Argument from God\u2019s Perfection\n\n\nJohn of Damascus argued that because God is perfect, he is\nnecessarily unique. The only way in which one god could be\ndistinguished from another would be by coming \u201cshort of\nperfection in goodness, or power, or wisdom, or time, or place,\u201d\nbut in that case \u201che would not be God\u201d (John of Damascus,\n173). Aquinas offers a similar argument: If there were several gods,\nthere would be several perfect beings but \u201cif none of these\nperfect beings lacks some perfection,\u201d and if none of them has\n\u201cany admixture of imperfection \u2026., nothing will be given\nin which to distinguish the perfect beings from one another\u201d\n(Aquinas, 158).\n\n\nArguments like this make two assumptions. The first is that\nproperties can be exhaustively divided into three classes. The first\nclass is the class of imperfections, that is, limitations (my inability\nto run a two minute mile, for instance) or privations (for example,\nblindness or sin\u2014properties that imply defects, some deviation\nfrom the standards appropriate for evaluating beings of the kind in\nquestion). The second is the class of mixed perfections, that is,\ngood-making properties that entail some limitation (for example, being\nhuman or being corporeal) or privation (repentance, for instance). The\nthird class is that of pure perfections\u2014perfections that entail\nno limitation or privation (for example, being, goodness, love,\nknowledge, power, unity, or independence). The second assumption is\nthat God possesses all and only pure perfections. With these\nassumptions in place, the argument works. Two gods couldn\u2019t be\ndistinguished by a difference in their pure perfections since both gods\nhave all of them. And they couldn\u2019t be distinguished by a difference in\ntheir other properties because they haven\u2019t any.\n\n\nUnfortunately, both assumptions seem false. For God appears to\npossess some properties which are neither imperfections, mixed\nperfections, nor pure perfections. If he does, then some properties\nbelong to none of our three classes, and not all of God\u2019s properties\nare pure perfections.\n\n\nThe property of being the ultimate cause of my existence appears to\nbe an example. The property isn\u2019t a (pure) perfection but, rather, a\ncontingent expression of a (pure) perfection, namely, the\nexercise of creative power. (God is perhaps better or more splendid for\nexercising creative power, but he is not better or more splendid for\nhaving created me.) But neither is it a limitation or\nprivation (though it is not, of course, a full or\ncomplete expression of the relevant divine perfection). Nor\ndoes it appear to be a mixed perfection. God\u2019s instantiating a possible\nworld containing me precludes his instantiating possible worlds which\nlack this interesting feature but entails no inherent limitation or\ndefect in his creative abilities. At least one real property, then, is\nneither an imperfection, mixed perfection, or pure perfection; and at\nleast one of God\u2019s real properties isn\u2019t a pure perfection. Both of the\nassumptions on which the argument is based are thus false.\n\n\nThe argument from divine perfection, like the argument from God\u2019s\nsimplicity, fails because God appears to possess some of his real\nproperties contingently. Yet the question remains, could two\ngods be distinguished on the basis of a difference in their contingent\nproperties? It is doubtful that the contingent properties we have\ndiscussed will serve our purpose. \u201cKnowing that Jones\nexists\u201d would (in a world containing Jones) be a property of any\nomniscient being existing in that world. And \u201cCreates\nSmith\u201d would (in a world containing Smith) be a property of any\ncreator of that world. Perhaps all of God\u2019s real but contingent\nproperties are expressions of his perfect knowledge, goodness, and\ncreative power. And perhaps it is impossible for two gods to exhibit\ndifferent expressions of this in the same possible world: In any\npossible world, w, two omniscient beings would know the same things;\nbeing supremely good their appreciations and valuations of the things\nin w would presumably be identical; and each would be the creative\nground of everything else that exists in w. If all of God\u2019s real but\ncontingent properties are expressions of his pure perfections and if,\nfor any possible world, two gods couldn\u2019t exhibit different expressions\nof those perfections in that world, then no possible world contains two\ngods.\n\n\nFurthermore, if there are individual essences, two individuals,\nx and y, couldn\u2019t differ only in their\ncontingent properties. (I is an individual essence of\nx if and only if x has I in every possible\nworld in which it exists and, for any individual, y, and any\npossible world, w, if y has I in w,\ny in w is identical with x.) For suppose\nthey did. Then their essential properties would be the same. A\nbeing\u2019s individual essence is an essential property of it, however.\nHence, if x and y had the same essential properties,\nthey would also have to have the same individual essence. But, in that\ncase, x and y wouldn\u2019t be two individuals\ncontrary to our supposition. And if no two beings can differ\nonly with respect to their contingent properties, two gods can\u2019t\neither. (For a sophisticated version of an argument of this type see\nZagzebski 1989.)\n\n\nCould two gods be distinguished by a difference in their\nessential properties, however? (The doctrine of simplicity may\nentail that they can\u2019t but\u2014as noted above\u2014the doctrine\nof simplicity is controversial.) Each god would obviously have to have\nall the properties essential to divinity (omniscience, omnipotence,\nperfect goodness, and the like). But could they be differentiated by\nessential properties peculiar to each? Could, in other words, the first\ngod have an essential property which the second god lacks, or vice\nversa? Zagzebski (1989) thinks that it can\u2019t. Human beings are\ndistinguished in virtue of their having different individual essences,\nand human rational beings and angelic rational beings are distinguished\nin virtue of their possessing the properties essential to humanity and\nto angelhood, respectively. But no individual human (way of being\nhuman) exhausts the fullness of humanity (the many ways of being\nhuman), and neither humanity nor angelhood exhaust the fullness of\nrationality (the many different ways of being rational). Being divine,\non the other hand, entails being \u201cwholly\u201d or\n\u201cperfectly\u201d divine, that is, being everything a divine\nbeing could possibly be. So \u201ctwo divine beings\u201d could not\ndiffer \u201cin an essential property\u201d in the way in which\nindividual human beings, or human beings and angelic beings, can.\n(Zagzebski 1989, 10\u201311)\n\n\nIs this argument entirely compelling, though? Arguably, it is\nimpossible for any individual to exemplify all the possible ways of\nbeing human or all of the possible ways of being rational. So why\nassume that it is possible for a being to exemplify all the possible\nways of being divine? Why think, in other words, that there aren\u2019t\ndifferent and mutually exclusive ways of exemplifying\ndivinity\u2014being Allah as depicted in the Quran, for example, or\nbeing the triune God of Christianity, or the Vishnu of the Shri\nVaishnavas? (For more on some of these possibilities see section 7\nbelow.) Or again, suppose that the relevant differentiating property\nis having a certain emotional or mental temper\u2014Yahweh\u2019s as\ndepicted in the Hebrew Bible, say, or Krishna\u2019s as depicted in the\nBhagavata Purana. Suppose further that neither of these emotional or\nmental tempers is better or more worshipful than the other. Isn\u2019t it\nan open question, at least, whether either of these emotional or\nmental tempers is essential to\ndivinity although they may be essential to being\nYahweh or being Krishna, respectively? If they aren\u2019t, then it is by no\nmeans clear that any being can exhaust the fullness of\ndivinity.\n\n\nWhile the arguments we have discussed in the last two sections are\nimpressive, they hinge on claims that would not be accepted by all\ntheists\u2014that God is simple, for example, or that there are real\nindividual essences, or that any wholly or perfectly divine being\nexhausts the fullness of divinity. By contrast, the three arguments\nthat we will examine next are firmly rooted in attributes which almost\nall theists ascribe to God\u2014his universal sovereignty,\nomnipotence, and demand for total devotion\u2014and are thus more\ncompelling.\n4. Two Arguments from God\u2019s Sovereignty\n4.1 The Argument from Causal Order\n\n\nOne of the most popular arguments for monotheism is drawn from the\nworld\u2019s unity. If there were several designers who acted independently\nor at cross-purposes, we would expect to find evidence of this in their\nhandiwork\u2014one set of laws obtaining at one time or place, for\nexample, and a different set of laws obtaining at a different time or\nplace. We observe nothing of the sort, however. On the contrary, the\nunity of the world, the fact that it exhibits a uniform structure, that\nit is a single cosmos, strongly suggests some sort of unity in its\ncause\u2014that there is either a single designer, or several\ndesigners acting cooperatively, perhaps under the direction of one of\ntheir number.\n\n\nThis evidence does not force us to conclude that there is only one\ndesigner, and the ablest proponents of the argument have recognized\nthis. Thus, William Paley asserts that the argument proves only\n\u201ca unity of counsel\u201d or (if there are subordinate agents)\n\u201ca presiding\u201d or \u201ccontrolling will\u201d (Paley 52).\nNevertheless, in the absence of compelling reasons for postulating the\nexistence of two or more cooperating designers, considerations of\nsimplicity suggest that we ought to posit only one designer. It isn\u2019t\nclear that there are any. Some have thought that the existence of evil\nand apparent disorder is best explained by postulating conflicts\nbetween two or more opposed powers. Whether this is true or not, evil\nand apparent disorder provides no reason for preferring the hypothesis\nof several cooperating designers to the hypothesis of a single\ndesigner. That is, having once decided that natural good and natural\nevil are consequences of the operation of a single system of laws, and\nthat their cause must therefore be unitary, the existence of\nevil and apparent disorder is to longer relevant to the question of\nmonotheism (although it may be relevant to the question of the\ngoodness of the cause).\n\nA posteriori arguments of this type can\u2019t be used to show\nthat there can be only one god, however\u2014that\nmonotheism is conceptually required by the theist\u2019s concept of\ndivinity. A more powerful argument from God\u2019s sovereignty remedies this\ndeficiency.\n4.2 An Argument from God\u2019s \u201cTotal Causality\u201d\n\n\nJohn Duns Scotus offers several proofs of God\u2019s unicity in his\nOrdinatio. Scotus\u2019s fourth proof is based on the theistic\nintuition that God is the complete or total cause of everything else.\nHis argument is roughly this:\n\nNecessarily, if anything is a god, its creative volition is the\nnecessary and sufficient causal condition of every other concrete\nobject.\n\n\n\nSuppose, then, that\n\nContingent beings exist and there are two gods.\n\n\n\nIt follows that\n\nEach is the necessary and sufficient causal condition of the set of\ncontingent beings. (From 1 and 2.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe first is a sufficient causal condition of the set of contingent\nbeings. (From 3.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nThe second is not a necessary causal condition of the set of\ncontingent beings. (From 4.)\n\n\n\nAgain,\n\nThe first is a necessary causal condition of the set of contingent\nbeings. (From 3.)\n\n\n\nSo\n\nThe second is not a sufficient causal condition of the existence of\nthe set of contingent beings. (From 6.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe second is neither a necessary nor a sufficient causal condition\nof the set of contingent beings. (From 5 and 7.)\n\n\n\nA similar argument will show that\n\nThe first is neither a necessary nor a sufficient causal condition\nof the existence of the set of contingent beings.\n\n\n\nIt follows that\n\nNeither god is either a necessary or a sufficient condition of the\nexistence of the set of contingent beings. (From 8 and 9.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nIf contingent beings existed and there were two gods, each would be\na necessary and sufficient causal condition of the existence of the set\nof contingent beings and neither would be a necessary and sufficient\ncausal condition of the existence of the set of contingent beings.\n(From 2 through 10.)\n\n\n\nBut since\n\nThe consequent of 11 is impossible,\n\n\nIts antecedent is impossible. (From 11 and 12. If p\nentails q, and q is impossible, then p is\nimpossible.)\n\n\n\nThus,\n\nIt is impossible that contingent beings exist and there are two\ngods. (From 13.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIf contingent beings exist, there cannot be two gods. (From 14.)\n(Scotus, 87)\n\n\n\nScotus\u2019s argument is firmly rooted in the theistic intuition that\nGod\u2019s creative volition is the necessary and sufficient causal\ncondition of everything that exists outside him. But as it stands it\nsuffers from two weaknesses.\n\n\nFirst, the argument doesn\u2019t show that God is necessarily\nunique but only that if contingent beings exist, only one God\nexists. The second, and more serious, difficulty arises from the fact\nthat there are at least two relevant senses of \u201csufficient causal\ncondition.\u201d\n\n\nStriking a match is a causally sufficient condition of the match\u2019s\nignition in a standard sense since, under normal conditions, if one\nstrikes the match, it will ignite. Many other conditions are causally\nnecessary for this event to occur, however\u2014the presence of\noxygen, the match\u2019s not being wet, and the like. But in a stronger\nsense, x is a causally sufficient condition of y if\nand only if given x alone, y exists or occurs. And in\nthat sense, striking the match is not causally\nsufficient for the match\u2019s ignition since other conditions are needed\nas well.\n\n\nThe problem with Scotus\u2019s argument, then, is this. The inferences\nfrom 4 to 5, and from 6 to 7, are valid only upon the assumption that\nif a cause is sufficient to produce an effect no other cause is a\nnecessary condition of that effect. But this is true only if a causally\nsufficient condition is such that it alone suffices to produce its\neffect, that is, if it is causally sufficient in the strong sense. If\n\u201ccausally sufficient condition\u201d is taken in the\nstrong sense, however, there are reasons to believe that the argument\u2019s\nfirst premise is false. Suppose, for example, that Abel would exist if\nand only if Adam and Eve were to freely copulate, and Adam and Eve\nwould freely copulate if and only if God were to create them. By\ncreating Adam and Eve, God brings about Abel\u2019s existence. Furthermore,\ngiven the truth of the relevant subjunctive conditionals, there is a\nclear sense in which God\u2019s doing so is not only a necessary but also a\nsufficient causal condition of Abel\u2019s existence. For if God creates\nAdam and Eve, Adam and Eve will beget Abel. It isn\u2019t sufficient in the\nstrong sense, however, because God\u2019s creating Adam and Eve won\u2019t, all\nby itself, ensure Abel\u2019s existence. For that to occur, Adam and Eve\u2019s\nfree decision to copulate is also needed. Theistic intuitions clearly\nsupport the claim that it is necessarily true that God\u2019s creative\nvolitions are a causally sufficient condition of the existence of every\nother concrete object in at least a weak sense. It is less clear that\nthey support the claim that it is necessarily true that God\u2019s creative\nvolitions are a causally sufficient condition of the existence of every\nother concrete object in the strong sense. (Theists with robust views\nof human freedom, for example, will deny that they are.)\n\n\nThe problem, in short is this. In order to be valid,\n\u201csufficient causal condition\u201d must be used in the same\nsense throughout the argument. If \u201ccausally sufficient\ncondition\u201d is taken in the weak sense, however, then the\ninferences from 4 to 5, and from 6 to 7, are illegitimate. Yet if\n\u201ccasually sufficient condition\u201d is taken in the strong\nsense, there are reasons to believe that its first premise is false. In\neither case, the argument is unsound.\n\n\nBoth defects can be remedied, though. Even theists with robust views\nof human freedom would presumably endorse\n\n\n1*.\nNecessarily, if any x is God, then for every concrete\nobject distinct from x, the activity of x is a\ncausally necessary condition for its existence, and if there are in\nfact one or more contingent beings distinct from x, then the\nactivity of x is causally sufficient (in the strong sense)\nfor the existence of at least one of them.\n\n\n\n\n(1*) is sufficient to yield our conclusion. For if the first god is\na causally necessary condition of the existence of every other concrete\nobject, then the second god is not a causally sufficient condition (in\nthe strong sense) of the existence of any contingent being.\nSimilarly, if the first god is a causally sufficient condition (in the\nstrong sense) of the existence of at least one contingent being, then\nthe second god is not a necessary condition of the existence of at\nleast one concrete object that is distinct from itself. And, of course,\nsimilar conclusions are true of the second god.\n\n\nMoreover, if God is a necessary being as many theists believe (that\nis, if God exists and is God in every possible world), then the\nargument\u2019s first defect can be remedied as well, since the mere\npossibility of the existence of contingent beings will be\nsufficient to establish God\u2019s necessary unicity. For consider the\nfollowing argument:\n\n\n1*.\nNecessarily, if any x is God, then for every concrete\nobject distinct from x, the activity of x is a\ncausally necessary condition for its existence, and if there are in\nfact one or more contingent beings distinct from x, then the\nactivity of x is causally sufficient (in the strong sense) for\nthe existence of at least one of them.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose, then, that\n\nThere are two gods and contingent beings are possible.\n\n\n\nIt follows that\n\nThere is a possible world, w, in which contingent beings\nexist (from 16), and that, because each god is necessary,\n\n\nBoth gods exist in w. (From 16.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nEach god is a necessary causal condition of the existence of each\ncontingent being in w, and each god is the sufficient causal\ncondition (in the strong sense) of the existence of at least one\ncontingent being in w. (From 1*, 17, and 18.)\n\n\n\nBut,\n\nIt is impossible that each god is a necessary causal condition of\nthe existence of each contingent being in w, and each god is\nthe sufficient causal condition (in the strong sense) of at least one\ncontingent being in w. (For, as we have seen, if one god is a\nnecessary causal condition of the existence of each contingent being in\nw, the other is not the sufficient causal condition [in the\nstrong sense] of any of them.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nIt is impossible that there are two gods and contingent beings are\npossible, that is, it is necessarily true that if contingent beings are\npossible, it is false that there are two gods. (From 1* through 20. If\na proposition [e.g., 16] together with one or more necessary truths\n[e.g., 1*] entails another [e.g., 19], and the second is impossible,\nthe first is impossible.)\n\n\n\nBut,\n\nIt is logically possible that contingent beings exist. (For they do\nexist.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nIt is necessarily true that it is logically possible that\ncontingent beings exist. (From 22. What is possible is necessarily\npossible.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is necessarily false that there are two gods. (From 21, 23, and\nthe principle that if one proposition entails another and the first is\nnecessarily true, then the second is necessarily true.)\n\n5. An Argument from Omnipotence\n\n\nAl-Ghazali argues that there can\u2019t be two gods, for \u201cwere\nthere two gods and one of them resolved on a course of action, the\nsecond would be either obliged to aid him and [sic] thereby\ndemonstrating that he was a subordinate being and not an all-powerful\ngod, or would be able to oppose and resist thereby demonstrating that\nhe was the all-powerful and the first weak and deficient, not an\nall-powerful god\u201d (Ghazali, 40). Ghazali\u2019s intuition is sound but\nhis argument can be more carefully formulated as follows:\n\nNecessarily, it is possible for the wills of distinct persons to\nconflict. (The possibility of conflict seems included in the concept of\na fully distinct person.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nNecessarily, if there are two distinct, essentially omnipotent\npersons, their wills can conflict. (From 1. Something has a property\nlike omnipotence essentially if and only if it has that property in\nevery logically possible world in which it exists.)\n\n\nIt is necessarily false that the wills of two omnipotent persons\nconflict.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is necessarily false that the wills of two essentially\nomnipotent persons can conflict. (From 3. If there is a possible world\nin which their wills can conflict, then, necessarily, there is a\npossible world in which both are omnipotent and their wills do\nconflict.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is impossible for there to be two distinct, essentially\nomnipotent, persons. (From 2 and 4.)\n\n\n\nIt follows that if, as most theists believe,\n\nIt is necessarily true that omnipotence is an essential attribute\nof God,\n\n\n\nthen\n\nIt is impossible for there to be two gods. (From 5 and 6.)\n\n\n\nPremise 3 is proved in this way:\n\nNecessarily, if the will of an omnipotent person conflicts with\nanother person\u2019s will, the latter\u2019s will is thwarted by the former\u2019s\n(since, if it were not, the omnipotent person would not be\nomnipotent.)\nNecessarily, if a person\u2019s will is thwarted by another\u2019s will, then\nthat person is not omnipotent.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nNecessarily, if there were two omnipotent persons and their wills\nconflicted, then (since each of their wills would be thwarted) neither\nwould be omnipotent. (From 8 and 9.)\nIt is impossible for there to be two omnipotent persons neither of\nwhom are omnipotent.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is impossible for the wills of two omnipotent persons to\nconflict. (From 10 and 11.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nIt is necessarily false that the wills of two omnipotent persons\nconflict. (From 12.)\n\n\n\nFour of the argument\u2019s five premises (namely, 6, 8, 9, and 11) are\nfairly noncontroversial. Premise 1 has been doubted, however. Thomas V.\nMorris has suggested that, for persons to be distinct, all that is\nneeded is the possibility that their wills differ. Suppose for\nexample, that it is impossible for x to will A and\nfor y to will not-A (and vice versa) but that it\nis possible for x to will A and for\ny to neither will A nor will not-A (and vice\nversa). Their wills could thus differ although they could not\nconflict.\n\n\nIs this sufficient to ensure distinctness of persons, though? It is\nnot clear that it is. If I somehow cannot will anything that\nis opposed to what some other person wills, my selfhood or identity as\na separate person appears endangered. And if the impossibility is not\nmerely contingent but logical or metaphysical, the threat to my\nindependent identity seems even greater.\n\n\nBut this aside, it is doubtful that the wills of two essentially\nomnipotent beings, at least, could differ in the manner\nMorris suggests. For suppose they can. Then, where x and\ny are both essentially omnipotent, and s is some\ncontingent state of affairs that is within the range of omnipotence,\nx can make y impotent with respect to s (and\nvice versa). For even though it is intrinsically possible for\ny to determine whether or not s will occur,\nx, merely by willing s, makes it impossible for\ny to will not-s. That is, x, as it were,\ntakes power over s out of y\u2019s hands. Whether or not\ns occurs, in other words, is no longer up to y. Yet\nsurely, if y is essentially omnipotent, and s is\nwithin the range of its power (as it must be if y is essentially\nomnipotent), no contingent circumstance of this sort could make it\nimpotent with respect to s. (For a similar argument see\nScotus\u2019s seventh proof of unicity [Scotus, 90\u20131].)\n\n\nPremise 1 thus emerges unscathed. Since the proof is valid and its\nother premises appear unexceptionable, the argument from omnipotence\nseems sound.\n6. An Argument from the Demand for Total Devotion\n\n\nAccording to William of Ockham, \u201cGod\u201d can be understood\nin two ways. By \u201cGod\u201d one may mean \u201csomething more\nnoble and more perfect than anything else besides him,\u201d or one\nmight mean \u201cthat than which nothing is more noble and more\nperfect.\u201d If God is understood in the first way, then there can\nbe only one god. For consider the following argument:\n\nNecessarily, if any being is God, it is more perfect than any other\nbeing.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nNecessarily, if there were two distinct beings and each were God,\nthe first would be more perfect than the second and the second would be\nmore perfect than the first. (From 1.)\n\n\n\nBut\n\nIt is impossible for there to be two beings each of which is more\nperfect than the other.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is impossible for there to be two gods. (From 2 and 3.)\n\n\n\nBut if God is understood in the second way, Ockham thinks that it\ncannot be shown that there is only one god. For it isn\u2019t clear that\nthere couldn\u2019t be two equally perfect beings, each of whom was such\nthat no actual or possible being surpassed it (Ockham, 139\u201340).\n\n\nEven if Ockham is right about this, it does seem impossible that\nthere be two gods. For it appears to be a conceptual truth\nthat God is unsurpassable. If he is, then, if there were two gods each\nwould be unsurpassable. But there can\u2019t be two unsurpassable beings\neach of which is God. For part of what it means to call\nsomething \u201cGod\u201d is that it is an appropriate object of\ntotal devotion and unconditional commitment. If there were two\nunsurpassable beings, however, our devotion and commitment should be\ndivided between them. (As Scotus says, if there were two infinite\ngoods, \u201can orderly will \u2026 could not be perfectly satisfied\nwith but one infinite good\u201d [Scotus, 87].) Since they are equally\nperfect, it would be inappropriate to be totally devoted or\nunconditionally committed to either one of them. But if it\nwould, then neither of them would be God. So if it is a conceptual\ntruth that God is unsurpassable, he must be unique.\n\n\nAn appeal to unsurpassability isn\u2019t really necessary, however, since\nGod\u2019s uniqueness follows directly from his being an appropriate object\nof total devotion and unconditional commitment. For consider the\nfollowing argument:\n\nGod is, by definition, a being worthy of worship (that is, of total\ndevotion and unconditional commitment).\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nNecessarily, if there were two gods, there would be two beings each\nof which was worthy of worship. (From 5.)\n\n\n\nIf so, then\n\nNecessarily, if there were two gods both of them ought to\nbe worshiped. (From 6. Cf. the inference from \u201cx is\nworthy of admiration\u201d to \u201ceveryone ought to admire\nx.\u201d)\n\n\n\nBut\n\nNecessarily, if we ought to worship both of these gods, then we\ncan worship both of them. (\u201cOught\u201d implies\n\u201ccan;\u201d we are only obligated to do what we are able to\ndo.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nNecessarily, if there were two gods, we could be totally devoted\nand unconditionally committed to the first, and totally devoted and\nunconditionally committed to the second. (From 7, 8, and the definition\nof \u201cworship.\u201d)\n\n\n\nHowever,\n\nIt is impossible to be totally devoted and unconditionally\ncommitted to each of two distinct beings.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is impossible for there to be two gods. (From 9 and 10.)\n\n\n\nThere are at least two possible problems with this argument,\nhowever. First, the inference from 6 to 7 might seem suspect. For if\n\u201cought\u201d does imply \u201ccan,\u201d and it\nis impossible to be totally devoted and unconditionally\ncommitted to each of two distinct beings (as 10 says), then we aren\u2019t\nunder any obligation to do so. The truth of 10 implies the falsity of\n7.\n\n\nMatters aren\u2019t so simple, however. \u201cI ought to return John\u2019s\ngun\u201d (since I promised to return it) and \u201cI ought not to\nreturn John\u2019s gun\u201d (since he is no longer in his right mind) do\nnot entail \u201cI can both return the gun and not return it.\u201d\nSo why think that if I ought to worship the first god and I ought to\nworship the second, I ought to worship both of them? Because the two\ncases are dissimilar. In the first, neither obligation is indefeasible;\neach can, in principle, be trumped by other stronger obligations. While\nI indeed have prima facie obligations both to return the gun and to not\nreturn it, the only actual obligation I have in the\ncircumstances that were described is the obligation to not return the\ngun. Because \u201cI ought to return the gun and I ought not to return\nthe gun (that is, I have a prima facie obligation to return it and a\nprima facie obligation to not return it)\u201d does not entail\n\u201cI have an actual obligation both to return and to not return the\ngun,\u201d there is no reason to infer that I can do both. By\ncontrast, both of the obligations referred to in 7 are indefeasible.\n(Their indefeasibility appears to be part of the very concept of divine\nworship; part of what it means to be God is to be such that no other\nobligation can take precedence over our obligation to be totally\ndevoted and unconditionally committed to him.) Both are therefore\nactual, and not merely prima facie, obligations. Now even though one\ncan have a prima facie obligation to do something one is unable to do,\nit is doubtful that one can have an actual obligation to do\nsomething one can\u2019t do. That I am obligated to worship both deities\nthus seems to entail that I can worship both deities. The inference\nfrom 6 to 7 seems sound.\n\n\nAnother possible problem concerns the truth of 10. Thus, Thomas\nMorris has objected that one could be unconditionally committed to each\nof two distinct beings provided that their wills were necessarily\nharmonious. For if their wills were necessarily harmonious,\nthey could not require of us conflicting acts. This objection should be\ndiscounted, however, because the wills of distinct persons are\nnecessarily opposable. (See discussion in section 5 above.)\n\n\nIt is perhaps less obvious why devotion can\u2019t be divided\nbetween two beings. But the best answer is probably this. The sort of\ndevotion appropriate to God involves centering one\u2019s life in God, and\nwhile one can center one\u2019s life in x-and-y, one can\u2019t center one\u2019s life\nin x and also center one\u2019s life in y. The devotion that God\nrequires appears, then, to be inherently indivisible.\n\n\nIn sum, neither of the two problems presents an unsurmountable\ndifficulty for the argument from total devotion.\n7. Are the \u201cMonotheistic Traditions\u201d Really Monotheistic?\n\n\nNo discussion of monotheism would be complete which failed to note\nthat some major theistic traditions contain strands which, on their\nface, seem at odds with their commitment to monotheism.\n7.1 The Kabbalah and Monotheism\n\n\nConsider the Kabbalah, for example. The Zohar (after 1275)\nidentifies the first principle with the En Sof or infinite (unlimited).\nThe En Sof is \u201cthe hidden God\u201d or \u201cinnermost\nbeing\u201d of God, without attributes or qualities. Because it lacks\nattributes, the En Sof is incomprehensible and thus, in a strict sense,\nnon-personal (although it reveals itself as personal).\n\n\nThe hidden God manifests itself in the sefirot, however. These are\nconceived as God\u2019s attributes, or as divine spheres or realms, or as\nstages (in his self-manifestation). They are also regarded as names\nwhich God gives himself, and together form his \u201cone great\nname,\u201d or as God\u2019s faces or garments, or as beams of his light.\nThey are also sometimes pictured as the branches of a tree whose root\nis the En Sof, \u201cthe hidden root of roots.\u201d (Alternatively,\nthe En Sof is depicted as the sap that circulates through, and\nmaintains, the branches.) These branches are thought of as extending\nthrough the whole of the created order; created things exist solely in\nvirtue of the fact that \u201cthe power of the sefirot lives and acts in\nthem.\u201d\n\n\nThere are ten sefirot or stages in God\u2019s self-manifestation. A brief\ndiscussion of the first three will be sufficient for our purposes. The\nfirst is, perhaps surprisingly, characterized as Nothing or the Abyss.\n(We are said to catch glimpses of it when things alter their form or\ndisappear; when things change or are destroyed, Nothingness or the\nAbyss becomes \u201cvisible\u201d for \u201ca fleeting \u2026\nmoment.\u201d) This mystical no-thing-ness is God\u2019s Supreme Crown.\n\n\nBoth Wisdom and Intelligence emerge or emanate from the Crown.\nWisdom is the \u201cideal thought\u201d of everything that will\nemerge in creation. The idea exists at this stage in a confused and\nundifferentiated form, however. Wisdom is sometimes pictured as a\nfountain which springs out of Nothingness (the Crown) and from which\nthe other sefirot will flow, sometimes as a seed or germ from which\neverything develops, and sometimes as a point. (The idea behind the\nlast image is that just as the movement of a point generates a line,\nand the movement of a line generates a surface, so the\n\u201cmovement\u201d of Wisdom [together with the\n\u201cmovement\u201d of Intelligence] generates the other sefirot.)\nIntelligence is the principle of \u201cindividuation and\ndifferentiation,\u201d and \u201cunfolds\u201d what is \u201cfolded\nup\u201d in wisdom. (If wisdom was the \u201cconfused\u201d or\nundifferentiated thought of creation, Intelligence is that thought\nbecome clear and distinct. [Scholem 1946, 207\u201309, 213\u201320; Epstein,\n236].)\n\n\nThe doctrine of the divine emanations or sefirot might already be\nthought to compromise God\u2019s unity. But matters become still more\nproblematic in an influential treatise that was composed in Provence\naround 1230, and (falsely) ascribed to Hai Goan.\n\n\nAccording to its pseudonymous author, \u201cthree hidden\nlights\u201d are found in the \u201croot of roots\u201d that exists\n\u201cabove the first sefirah\u201d\u2014\u201cthe inner\nprimordial light,\u201d the \u201ctransparent (or: ultra clear)\nlight,\u201d and \u201cthe clear light.\u201d These\n\u201clights\u201d are one thing and one substance that \u201care\nfound without separation and without union, in the most intimate\nrelation with the root of roots,\u201d or (more strongly) are the\nvery \u201cname and substance of the root of all roots.\u201d The\nthree lights are the immediate source of \u201cthe three supreme\nsefirot of \u2018Pure Thought,\u2019 \u2018Knowledge,\u2019 and\n\u2018Intellect,\u2019\u201d but whereas the sefirot\n\u201cthemselves are clearly created [or emanated?] \u2026 the\ntriad of the lights illuminate one another, uncreated [and\nunemanated?], without beginning, in the hidden root.\u201d According\nto the Pseudo-Hai, then, a triad exists in the hidden Godhead\nitself.\n\n\nLater Kabbalists were aware \u201cof a possible connection between\nthese ideas and the Christian Trinity,\u201d but explained the latter\nas a corruption of the former. Jesus and his disciples were themselves\n\u201creal Kabbalists, \u2018only their Kabbalah was full of\nmistakes\u2019\u201d\u2014their doctrine of the Trinity was the\nresult of their misinterpretation of the doctrine of the three lights!\nWhatever one thinks of this, there are striking similarities\nbetween the two doctrines. But there are also important differences.\nThe lights \u201care neither persons nor \u2018hypostases\u2019 in\nGod,\u201d for example, and there is no mention of \u201cspecific\nrelationships\u201d between them (such as begetting and being\nbegotten, or \u201cspiration\u201d and \u201cprocession\u201d) (Scholem\n1987, 349\u201354).\n The suspicion of Christian influence was by no means restricted to\nthe Pseudo-Hai\u2019s doctrine of the three lights, however, for\n\u201cphilosophical opponents of the Kabbalah\u201d had already\nsuggested \u201cthat the doctrine of the ten sefirot was [itself] of\nChristian origin\u201d (Scholem 1987, 354). Nor was this criticism\neasily laid to rest. Thus, Isaac bar Sheshet Parfat (1326\u20131408)\nsays (Gellman 2013, 46) that he had \u201cheard a philosopher speak\nin a defaming manner of the Kabbalists,\u201d saying\n\u201c\u2018The Gentiles [Christians] are believers in a trinity,\nand the kabbalists are believers in a ten-ity\u2019\u201d.\n\n\nThe general problem, of course, was that, on its surface at least, the\ndoctrine of the sefirot seems incompatible with God\u2019s unity. Rabbi\nAzriel of Gerona (d. 1238) addressed this issue in his\n\u201cExplanation of the Ten Sefirot.\u201d In the first place, the\nhigher sefirot, at least, have always existed \u201cin potentia\nin the Eyn Sof before they were actualized\u201d (Azriel,\n93, my emphasis) Moreover, because \u201cthe receptor [the sefirah]\n\u2026 unite[s] with the bestower [ultimately, the En Sof] into one\npower, \u2026 the two are really one.\u201d So the answer to our\ndifficulty is apparently this. The emanation of the sefirot is\ncompatible with God\u2019s unity because (unlike created beings) the\nsefirot are contained within the En Sof itself in a potential or\nundifferentiated form, and because (since their power is the\npower of the En Sof), there is ultimately only one power. Thus,\n\u201cno emanation is radiated forth except to proclaim the unity\nwithin the Eyn Sof\u201d (Azriel, 93\u201395). Or as Rabbi Moshe\nHaim Luzzatto claimed (Gellman 2013, 46) in the first half of the\neighteenth century, \u201cthe sefirot are not separate from the one\nwho emanates, for they are like the flame connected to the coal, and\nall is one, a unity that has within it no division.\u201d Whether\nconsiderations like these fully resolve the problem is a moot\nquestion.\n\n\nStill, the Kabbalah is only one strand within Judaism. By contrast,\nthe doctrine of the Trinity, and of the divinity of both Vishnu and\nLakshmi, are firmly rooted at the very heart of Christianity and Shri\nVaishnavism, respectively. Perhaps as a result, these traditions have\ndevoted much more thought to reconciling monotheism with elements\nwhich, on their face, seem at odds with it.\n7.2 Christianity and the Trinity\n\n\nThe question of the Trinity\u2019s compatibility with monotheism is best\napproached by seeing how that doctrine fares in the light of the three\nstrongest arguments for God\u2019s uniqueness\u2014the arguments from\nGod\u2019s sovereignty, from his omnipotence, and from the demand for total\ndevotion.\n\n\nThe crucial premise of the first argument is that God\u2019s will is the\ncausally necessary and sufficient condition of the existence of\ncontingent beings. (Or, alternatively, a causally necessary condition\nof the existence of every contingent being and the causally sufficient\ncondition [in the strong sense] of the existence of at least one of\nthem. For the sake of brevity we will focus exclusively on the simpler\ncase, however.) The argument from sovereignty can be deployed against\nthe Trinity only if the relevant property is regarded as an attribute\nof each member of the Trinity rather than of the Trinity as a whole\n(that is, of the Trinity considered as a single concrete entity). The\nWestern or Augustinian Tradition does not. On the contrary, the divine\nintellect and will are aspects of a single divine essence that subsists\nin three \u201cpersons\u201d or \u201chypostases.\u201d It is thus\nfalse that there are three distinct creative wills, and therefore false\nthat there are three distinct creative wills each of which is a\nnecessary and sufficient causal condition of the existence of\ncontingent beings.\n\n\nAnother view, though, is implicit in the position of many second and\nthird century church fathers, some western Christian Platonists, and\nthe Eastern Orthodox Church as a \n  whole.[1] \n The Trinitarian views of Ralph\nCudworth (1617\u201388) are fairly typical of this position. There are three\nhypostases or \u201cpersons.\u201d Each has its own individual\nessence. But all share a common specific or generic essence (namely,\ndivinity), so that each member of the Trinity is eternal, necessarily\nexistent, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and the like.\n\n\n\u201cThere is not a trinity of [independent] principles,\u201d\nhowever, \u201cbut \u2026 only one principle or fountain of Godhead\n[the Father] \u2026 from which the other[s, namely, the Son and the\nHoly Spirit] are derived.\u201d They together constitute one entity\n(\u201cone entire divinity\u201d), as \u201cthe root, and the stock\nand the branches\u201d constitute \u201cone tree,\u201d or as the\nsun, the light, and its splendor are \u201cundivided\u201d and form\none thing. Indeed, there is so \u201cnear a conjunction\u201d\nbetween the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as can be found nowhere else\nin nature. The relations between them are necessary and eternal; they\nare \u201cindivisibly and inseparably united.\u201d Moreover, each\nperson inheres or indwells in the others, and they are all \u201cad\nextra one and the same God, jointly concurring in all the same\nactions,\u201d they being all \u201cone creator\u201d (Cudworth,\n598, 616\u201320).\n\n\nOn the surface, the argument from sovereignty appears to preclude\nthe \u201cPlatonic Trinity.\u201d For, on Cudworth\u2019s view, the wills\nof the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are necessarily concurrent.\nFor example, \u201cThe Father wills that s\u201d entails\n\u201cThe Son wills that s,\u201d and vice versa. Because the\ncreative volition of any member of the Trinity entails that the other\ntwo will the same thing, if any one of them wills the\nexistence of a contingent being, then they all will it. So if\ntheir concurrent willings are a causally sufficient condition of\nthe existence of contingent beings, then the Father\u2019s (or the Son\u2019s or\nthe Holy Spirit\u2019s) willing the existence of contingent beings is itself\na causally sufficient condition of the existence of contingent beings\n(since it entails the concurrent willing). And, of course, the creative\nvolition of any member of the Trinity is also a necessary\ncausal condition of the existence of contingent beings. It would seem,\nthen, that there are three creative volitions, each\nof which is a causally sufficient and causally necessary condition of\nthe existence of contingent beings. There are thus three sovereign\ncreative wills, and this appears to contradict the monotheistic claim\nthat sovereignty is necessarily unique.\n\n\nAppearances may be deceiving, however. For even though the Father\u2019s\n(or the Son\u2019s or the Holy Spirit\u2019s) willing that s entails\nthat s, the Father\u2019s volition isn\u2019t, by itself,\nsufficient for s\u2019s occurrence. For s won\u2019t occur\nunless the Son and Holy Spirit also will it. It is therefore\nnot causally sufficient for the occurrence of s in\nthe strong sense of sufficient condition employed in the argument from\nsovereignty, namely, that x is a causally sufficient\ncondition of y in the strong sense if and only if, given\nx alone, y exists or occurs. In that sense,\nthere is only one causally sufficient condition of the\nexistence of contingent beings, and that is the joint\noperation of the\nnecessarily concurrent wills of the Father, Son, and Holy\nSpirit. So there is, as Cudworth says, only \u201cone creator.\u201d\nIt thus isn\u2019t clear that either the premises or conclusion of the\nargument from divine sovereignty precludes the existence of the\nPlatonic Trinity.\n\n\nNor does the omnipotence proof rule out the existence of the\nTrinity, since the hypostases are not distinct persons in the\nnontechnical sense of \u201cperson\u201d employed in that` argument.\nThey are not distinct persons in the ordinary sense of\n\u201cperson\u201d because their wills can\u2019t conflict. Either there\nis only one will (which is part of the one divine essence) or the\n(distinct) wills of the three hypostases necessarily concur.\n\n\nFinally, the third argument precludes the existence of the Trinity\nonly if each member is, in abstraction from the others, an appropriate\nobject of total devotion and unconditional commitment. In spite of the\naberrations of some Christians, it is reasonably clear that the object\nof the Christian\u2019s ultimate concern is the Trinity as a whole,\nand not one or more of its members considered in isolation. Christian\nattitudes towards the Father, for example, are inseparable from\nChristian attitudes towards the Son. Christ is worshiped as\nthe Son of the Father, for instance, and the Father is worshiped\nas the one who fully reveals himself in Christ. It follows\nthat Christians are only committed to regarding the triad as\nthe appropriate object of theistic attitudes, and that the argument\nfrom the appropriateness of these attitudes therefore cannot be used to\nshow that a trinity of divine \u201cpersons\u201d is impossible.\n7.3 The Shri Vaishnavas and Monotheism\n\n\nThe Shri Vaishnavas provide our third example of a monotheism that is\n\u201ctainted\u201d by elements apparently in tension with it. The\nShri Vaishnavas identify Vishnu with the Brahman. According to\nRamanuja (1017?\u20131137?), Brahman is personal. Indeed, he is\nthe supreme person (paratman), creator and Lord, who leads\nsouls to salvation. Far from having no (positive) attributes, as some\nVedantins maintain, Brahman is the sum of all \u201cnoble\nattributes\u201d\u2014omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, and\nall-merciful. He is also advitya (without rival). Shiva, Brahma, and\nthe other gods of the Hindu pantheon are Brahman\u2019s agents or servants,\ncreated and commissioned by him. (They have the same status, in short,\nthat angels have in the western religious traditions.)\n\n\n\u201cThe entire complex of intelligent and non-intelligent beings\n(souls and matter [prakriti]) \u2026 is real and constitutes the\nform, i. e., the body of the highest Brahman\u201d (Ramanuja 1962,\n88). The space-time world with all it contains is thus related to God\nas our bodies are related to our souls. A soul-body relationship,\naccording to Ramanuja, is a relationship between (1) support and\nsupported, (2) controller and controlled, and (3)\n\u201cprincipal\u201d and \u201caccessory.\u201d (Images of the\nlast relationship are provided by the relations between a master and\nhis \u201cborn servant\u201d or an owner and his disposable\nproperty.) A body is \u201centirely subordinate\u201d to its soul\n(Ramanuja 1962, 424), having no independent reality or value. If the\nspace-time world is Vishnu\u2019s body, then, it is absolutely dependent on\nVishnu, and has little or no value in comparison with him.\n\n\nThe Shri Vaishnava picture of reality is thus clearly monotheistic.\nProblems are created, however, by the fact that the scriptures on which\nthe Shri Vaishnavas draw closely associate Vishnu with his consort\nLakshmi. In the Pancaratras, for example, \u201cthe five functions\nassociated with God\u2019s oversight of the world,\u201d namely, creation,\npreservation, destruction, and \u201cobscuration\u201d and\n\u201cfavoring\u201d (roughly, withholding and bestowing grace) are\nsometimes ascribed to Vishnu and sometimes to Lakshmi (Kumar, 23f).\nAgain, while Ramanuja and his great predecessor, Yamuna, have little or\nnothing to say about Lakshmi in their philosophical writings, she plays\na significant role in their devotional works, where she is described as\nMediatrix between Vishnu and his devotees. Yamuna describes her as\ninseparable from the Lord, for example, and insists that while\nnon-intelligent and intelligent beings (including the gods such as\nBrahma and Shiva) are \u201conly a small part of God\u2019s reality,\n\u2026 the divine consort\u201d is \u201cthe equal match of the\nLord, \u2026 sharing the same auspicious qualities\u201d (Kumar,\n61). Ramanuja, too, claims that Vishnu and Lakshmi are \u201ceternally\nassociated,\u201d and asserts that both possess \u201c\u2018the\nmultitude \u2026 of unlimited, unsurpassed, and innumerable\nauspicious qualities\u2019\u201d (Kumar 66\u20137). All of this is\nregarded as compatible with the oneness or nonduality of \u201cthe\nultimate reality,\u201d however. Thus, Yamuna insists that Brahman\n(Vishnu) is the one without a second who \u201c\u2018neither has, nor\nhad, nor will have an equal or superior capable of being counted as a\nsecond\u2019\u201d (Kumar, 61). Nevertheless, the precise\nrelationship between Vishnu and Lakshmi was left undefined, and it\nremained for later generations to work out fuller accounts which both\nrespected Lakshmi\u2019s importance to ritual and devotion and at the same\ntime protected monotheism. There were two major resolutions.\n\n\nThe first is represented by Lokacarya (1213\u20131323). For Lokacarya,\nthe divine consort\u2019s role is subordinate and, perhaps, ultimately,\nnonessential. Lakshmi displays the \u201cthree essential attributes of\na mediator: mercy \u2026 , dependence on the Lord, \u2026 and\nnon-subservience [to] another [than the Lord].\u201d Her ability to\nmediate between souls and their Lord is thus ultimately dependent on\nher relation to Vishnu. In other words, Shri Lakshmi \u201cmediates\nnot as an equal partner of the Lord \u2026 but only as his dependent\nand subordinate.\u201d There is even a suggestion that Vishnu can\nhimself function as a mediator without Lakshmi\u2019s assistance. Thus,\nLokacarya \u201cpoints out that in the Mahabharata, Krishna himself\nbecomes the mediator, whereas in the Ramayana, Sita becomes the\nmediator.\u201d (The relevance of this remark becomes clear when one\nrecalls that both Krishna and Sita\u2019s consort, Rama, are avataras or\n\u201cdescents\u201d [very roughly, incarnations] of Vishnu.) (Kumar\n102\u201307) Lokacarya, then, preserves monotheism by more or less\ndowngrading Lakshmi\u2019s status.\n\n\nVenkatanatha (1268\u20131369) offers a different resolution. He does\ndistinguish \u201cthe two [salvific] functions of the Lord and his\nconsort,\u201d the Lord being \u201cdepicted as the father who\ndisciplines the sinner,\u201d and Lakshmi as the divine mother who\nintercedes for him. The distinction between these functions is not\nabsolute, however, for the divine consort merely \u201cbring[s] out\nthe \u2018Lord\u2019s natural compassion\u2019 so that that compassion\nbecomes the basis for the spiritual rebirth of the offending\ndevotee\u201d (Kumar 120\u201321). Moreover (and most important for our\npurposes), there is no real or ontological difference between the\ndivine father and the divine mother. Lakshmi is an inseparable\nattribute of Vishnu. Since a substance and its inseparable attributes\n\u201cshare in the same essential nature,\u201d and since one can\u2019t\nunderstand a substance without understanding its \u201cessential and\ninseparable attribute[s],\u201d the Lord and his divine consort form\n\u201ca single reality\u201d (Kumar 146\u20137). Thus\n\u201c\u2018whenever Bhagavan [i.e., Vishnu] is referred to, Lakshmi\nshould also be considered as referred to,\u2019\u201d and when one\noffers oneself to either one is offering oneself to both since the\ndeity to which one offers oneself \u201c\u2018is single [though] it\nrests with two\u2019\u201d (Kumar 124). In short, Venkatanatha\npreserves monotheism by denying that God and his divine consort are\nontologically distinct.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aquinas, St. Thomas, <em>On the Truth of the Catholic Faith:\nSumma Contra Gentiles, Book One</em>, Anton C.
