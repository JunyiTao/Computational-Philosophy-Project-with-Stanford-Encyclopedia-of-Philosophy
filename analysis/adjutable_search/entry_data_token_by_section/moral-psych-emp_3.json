Virtue Ethics and Skepticism About Character\n\nTo date, empirically informed approaches to moral psychology have been\nmost prominent in discussions of moral character and virtue. The focus\nis decades of experimentation in \u201csituationist\u201d social\npsychology: unobtrusive features of situations have repeatedly been\nshown to impact behavior in seemingly arbitrary, and sometimes\nalarming, ways. Among the findings that have most interested\nphilosophers:\n\n The Phone Booth Study (Isen & Levin (1972: 387):\npeople who had just found a dime in a payphone\u2019s coin return\nwere 22 times more likely than those who did not find a dime to help a\nwoman who had dropped some papers (88% v. 4%). \nThe Good Samaritan Study (Darley & Batson 1973: 105):\nunhurried passersby were 6 times more likely than hurried passersby to\nhelp an unfortunate who appeared to be in significant distress (63% v.\n10%).\nThe Obedience Experiments (Milgram 1974) subjects\nrepeatedly punished a screaming victim with realistic (but simulated)\nelectric shocks at the polite request of an experimenter.\nThe Stanford Prison Study (Zimbardo 2007): college\nstudents role-playing as \u201cguards\u201d in a simulated prison\nsubjected student \u201cprisoners\u201d to grotesque verbal and\nemotional abuse.\n\n\nThese experiments are part of an extensive empirical literature,\nwhere social psychologists have time and again found that\ndisappointing omissions and appalling actions are readily induced by\napparently minor situational\n features.[10]\n The striking fact is not that people fail standards for good conduct,\nbut that they can be so easily induced to do so.\n\nExploiting this observation, \u201ccharacter skeptics\u201d contend\nthat if moral conduct varies so sharply, often for the worse, with\nminor perturbations in circumstance, ostensibly good character\nprovides very limited assurance of good conduct. In addition to this\nclaim in descriptive psychology, concerning the fragility of\nmoral character, some character skeptics also forward a thesis in\nnormative ethics, to the effect that character merits less\nattention in ethical thought than it traditionally\n gets.[11]\n\n\nCharacter skepticism contravenes the influential program of\ncontemporary virtue ethics, which maintains that advancing\nethical theory requires more attention to character, and\nvirtue ethicists offer vigorous\n resistance.[12]\n Discussion has sometimes been overheated, but it has resulted in a\nlarge literature in a vibrantly interdisciplinary field of\n\u201ccharacter studies\u201d (e.g., Miller et al.\n 2015).[13]\n The literature is too extensive for the confines of this entry, but\nwe will endeavor to outline some of the main issues. \n\nThe first thing to observe is that the science which inspires the\ncharacter skeptics may itself be subject to skepticism. Given the\nuneven history of the human sciences, it might be argued that the\nrelevant findings are too uncertain to stand as a constraint on\nphilosophical theorizing. This contention is potentially buttressed by\nrecent prominent replication failures in social psychology. \n\nThe psychology at issue is, like much of science, unfinished business.\nBut the replication controversy, and the attendant suspicion of\nscience, is insufficient grounds for dismissing the psychology out of\nhand. Philosophical conclusions should not be based on a few studies;\nthe task of the philosophical consumer of science is to identify\ntrends in convergent strands of evidence (Doris\n2015: 49, 56; Machery & Doris forthcoming). The observation that\nmotivates character skepticism\u2014the surprising situational\nsensitivity of behavior\u2014is supported by a wide range of\nscientific findings, as well as by recurring themes in history and\nbiography (Doris 2002, 2005). The strong situational\ndiscriminativeness of behavior is accepted as fact by high proportion\nof involved scientists; accordingly, it is not much contested in\ndebates about character skepticism.\n\nBut the philosophical implications of this fact remain, after\nconsiderable debate, a contentious issue. The various responses to\ncharacter skepticism need not be forwarded in isolation, and some of\nthem may be combined as part of a multi-pronged defense. Different\nrejoinders have differing strengths and weaknesses, particularly with\nrespect to the differing pieces of evidence on which character\nskeptics rely; the phenomena are not unitary, and accommodating them\nall may preclude a unitary response. \n\nOne way of defusing empirically motivated skepticism\u2014dubbed by\nAlfano (2013) \u201cthe dodge\u201d\u2014is simply to deny that\nvirtue ethics makes empirical claims. On this understanding, virtue\nethics is cast as a \u201cpurely normative\u201d endeavor aiming at\nerecting ethical ideals in complete absence of empirical commitments\nregarding actual human psychologies. This sort of purity is perhaps\nless honored than honored in the breach: historically, virtue ethics\nhas been typified by an interest in how actual people become\ngood. Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics, 1099b18\u201319)\nthought that anyone not \u201cmaimed\u201d with regard to the\ncapacity for virtue may acquire it \u201cby a certain kind of study\nand care\u201d, and contemporary Aristotelians have emphasized the\nimportance of moral education and development (e.g., Annas 2011). More\ngenerally, virtue-based approaches have been claimed to have an\nadvantage over major Kantian and consequentialist competitors with\nrespect to \u201cpsychological realism\u201d\u2014the advantage of\na more lifelike moral psychology (see Anscombe 1958: 1, 15; Williams\n1985; Flanagan 1991: 182; Hursthouse 1999: 19\u201320). \n\nTo be sure, eschewing empirical commitment allows virtue ethics to\nescape empirical threat: obviously, empirical evidence cannot be used\nto undermine a theory that makes no empirical claims.\nHowever, it is not clear such theories could claim advantages\ntraditionally claimed for virtue theories with regard to moral\ndevelopment and psychological realism. In any event, they are not\ncontributions to empirical moral psychology, and needn\u2019t be\nfurther discussed here.\n\nBefore seeing how the debate in moral psychology might be advanced, it\nis necessary to correct a mischaracterization that serves to arrest\nprogress. It is too often said, particularly in reference to Doris\n(1998, 2002) and Harman (1999, 2000), that character skepticism comes\nto the view that character traits \u201cdo not exist\u201d (e.g.,\nFlanagan 2009: 55). Frequently, this attribution is made without\ndocumentation, but when documentation is provided, it is typically in\nreference to some early, characteristically pointed, remarks of Harman\n(e.g., 1999). Yet in his most recent contribution, Harman (2009: 241)\nsays, \u201cI do not think that social psychology demonstrates there\nare no character traits\u201d. For his part, Doris has repeatedly\nasserted that traits exist, and has repeatedly drawn attention to such\nassertions (Doris 1998: 507\u2013509; 2002: 62\u20136; 2005: 667;\n2010: 138\u2013141; Doris & Stich 2005: 119\u201320; Doris &\nPrinz 2009). \n\nWith good reason, to say \u201ctraits do not exist\u201d is\ntantamount to denying that there are individual dispositional\ndifferences, an unlikely view that character skeptics and antiskeptics\nare united in rejecting. Quite unsurprisingly, this unlikely view is\nseriously undersubscribed in both philosophy and psychology. It is\nendorsed by neither the most aggressive critics of personality,\nsituationists in social psychology such as Ross and Nisbett (1991),\nnor by the patron saint of situationism in personality psychology:\nMischel (1999: 45). Mischel disavows a trait-based approach, but his\nskepticism concerns a particular approach to traits, not\nindividual dispositional differences more generally. \n\nThen the question of whether or not traits exist is emphatically\nnot the issue dividing more and less skeptical approaches to\ncharacter. Today, all mainstream parties to the debate are\n\u201cinteractionist\u201d, treating behavioral outcomes as the\nfunction of a (complex) person by situation interaction (Mehl et al.\n2015)\u2014and it\u2019s likely most participants have always been\nso (Doris 2002: 25\u20136). Contemporary research programs in\npersonality and social psychology freely deploy both personal\nand situational variables (e.g., Cameron, Payne, & Doris 2013;\nLeikas, L\u00f6nnqvist, & Verkasalo 2012; Sherman, Nave, &\nFunder 2010). The issue worth discussing is not whether individual\ndispositional differences exist, but how these differences should\nbe characterized, and how (or whether) these individual\ndifferences, when appropriately characterized, should inform\nethical thought. \n\nAn important feature of early forays into character skepticism was\nthat skeptics tended to focus on behavioral implications of\ntraits rather than the psychological antecedents of behavior\n(Doris 2015: 15). Defenders of virtue ethics observe that character\nskeptics have had much to say about situational variation in behavior\nand little to say about the psychological processes underlying it,\nwith the result that they overlook the rational order in\npeople\u2019s lives (Adams 2006: 115\u2013232). These virtue\nethicists maintain that the behavioral variation provoking character\nskepticism evinces not unreliability, but rationally appropriate\nsensitivity to differing situations (Adams 2006; Kamtekar 2004). The\nvirtuous person, such as Aristotle\u2019s exemplary\nphronimos (\u201cman of practical wisdom\u201d) may\nsometimes come clean, and sometimes dissemble, or sometimes fight, and\nsometimes flee, depending on the particular ethical demands of his\ncircumstances.\n\nFor example, in the Good Samaritan Study, the hurried passersby was on\nthe way to an appointment where they had agreed to give a\npresentation; perhaps these people made a rational\ndetermination\u2014perhaps even an ethically defensible\ndetermination\u2014to weigh the demands of punctuality and\nprofessionalism over ethical requirement to check on the welfare of a\nstranger in apparent distress. However attractive one finds such\naccounting for this case (note that some of Darley and Batson\u2019s\n[1973] hurried passersby failed to notice the victim, which strains\nexplanations in terms of their rational discriminations), there are\nother cases where the \u201crationality response\u201d seems plainly\nunattractive. These are cases of ethically irrelevant influences\n (Sec. 2 above;\n Doris & Stich 2005), where it seems unlikely the influence could\nbe cited as part of a rationalizing explanation of the behavior:\nit\u2019s odd to cite failing to find a dime as\njustification for failing to help\u2014or for that matter,\nfinding a dime as justification for doing so.\n\nIt is certainly appropriate for virtue ethicists to emphasize\npractical rationality in their accounts of character. This is a\ncentral theme in the tradition going back to Aristotle himself, who is\nprobably the most oft-cited canonical philosopher in contemporary\nvirtue ethics. But while the rationality response may initially\naccommodate some of the troubling behavioral evidence, it encounters\nfurther empirical difficulty. There is an extensive empirical\nliterature problematizing familiar conceptions of rationality:\npsychologists have endlessly documented a dispiriting range of\nreasoning errors (Baron 1994, 2001; Gilovich et al. 2002; Kahneman et\nal. 1982; Tversky & Kahneman 1973; Kruger & Dunning 1999;\nNisbett & Borgida 1975; Nisbett & Ross 1980; Stich 1990;\nTversky & Kahneman 1981). In light of this evidence, character\nskeptics claim that the vagaries afflicting behavior also afflict\nreasoning (Alfano 2013; Olin & Doris 2014). \n\nResearch supporting this discouraging assessment of human rationality\nis controversial, and not all psychologists think things are so bleak\n(Gigerenzer 2000; Gigerenzer et al. 1999; for philosophical commentary\nsee Samuels & Stich 2002). Nevertheless, if virtue ethics is to\nhave an empirically credible moral psychology, it needs to account for\nthe empirical challenges to practical reasoning: how can the relevant\nexcellence in practical reasoning be developed? \n\nFaced with the challenge to practical rationality, virtue ethicists\nmay respond that their theories concern excellent reasoning,\nnot the ordinary reasoning studied in psychology. Practical\nwisdom, and the ethical virtue it supports, are expected to be\nrare, and not widely instantiated. This state of affairs, it\nis said, is quite compatible with the disturbing, but not\nexceptionlessly disturbing, behavior in experiments like\nMilgram\u2019s (see Athanassoulis 1999: 217\u2013219; DePaul 1999;\nKupperman 2001: 242\u20133). If this account is supposed to be part\nof an empirically contentful moral psychology, rather than unverified\nspeculation, we require a detailed and empirically substantiated\naccount of how the virtuous few get that way\u2014remember that an\nemphasis on moral development is central to the virtue ethics\ntradition. Moreover, if virtue ethics is supposed to have widespread\npractical implications\u2014as opposed to being merely a celebration\nof a tiny \u201cvirtue elite\u201d\u2014it should have an account\nof how the less-than-virtuous-many may at least tolerably\napproximate virtue. \n\nThis point is underscored by the fact that for some of the troubling\nevidence, as in the Stanford Prison Study, the worry is not so much\nthat people fail standards of virtue, but that they fail standards of\nminimal decency. Surely an approach to ethics that celebrates\nmoral development, even one that acknowledges (or rather, insists)\nthat most people will not attain its ideal, might be expected to have\nan account of how people can become minimally decent.\n\nRecently, proponents of virtue ethics have been increasingly proposing\na suggestive solution to this problem: virtue is a skill acquired\nthrough effortful practice, so virtue is a kind of expertise (Annas\n2011; Bloomfield 2000, 2001, 2014; Jacobson 2005; Russell 2015; Snow\n2010; Sosa 2009; Stichter 2007, 2011; for reservations, see Doris, in\npreparation). The virtuous are expert at morality and\u2014given the\nAristotelian association of virtue and happiness\u2014expert at life.\n\n\nAn extensive scientific literature indicates that developing expert\nskill requires extensive preparation, whether the practitioner is a\nnovelist, doctor, or chess master\u2014around 10,000 hours of\n\u201cdeliberate practice\u201d, according to a popular\ngeneralization (Ericsson 2014; Ericsson et al. 1993). The\n\u201c10,000\u2013hour rule\u201d is likely an oversimplification,\nbut there is no doubt that attaining expertise requires intensive\ntraining. Because of this, people rarely achieve eminence in more than\none area; for instance, \u201cbaseball trivia\u201d experts display\nsuperior recall for baseball-related material, but not for\nnon-baseball material (Chiesi et al. 1979). Conversely, becoming\nexpert at morality, or (even more ambitiously) expert at the whole of\nlife, would apparently require a highly generalized form of\nexpertise: to be good, there\u2019s a lot to be good at.\nMoreover, it\u2019s quite unclear what deliberate practice at life\ninvolves; how exactly does one get better at being good? \n\nOne obvious problem concerns specifying the \u201cgood\u201d in\nquestion. Expertises like chess have been effectively studied in part\nbecause there are accepted standards of excellence (the\n\u201cELO\u201d score used for ranking chess players; Glickman\n1995). To put it blithely, there aren\u2019t any chess skeptics. But\nthere have, historically, been lots of moral skeptics. And if\nthere\u2019s not moral knowledge, how could there be moral experts?\nAnd even if there are moral experts, there\u2019s the problem of how\nare they to be identified, since it is not clear we are possessed of\nstandard independent of expert opinion itself (like winning chess\nmatches) for doing so (for the \u201cmetaethics of expertise\u201d,\nsee McGrath 2008, 2011).\n\nEven if these notorious philosophical difficulties can be\nresolved\u2014as defenders of expertise approaches to virtue must\nthink they can\u2014matters remain complicated, because if moral\nexpertise is like other expertises, practice alone\u2014assuming we\nhave a clear notion of what \u201cmoral practice\u201d\nentails\u2014will be insufficient. While practice matters in\nattaining expertise, other factors, such as talent, also matter\n(Hambrick et al. 2014; Macnamara et al. 2014). And some of the\nrequired endowments may be quite unequally distributed across\npopulations: practice cannot make a jockey into an NFL lineman, or an\nNFL lineman into a jockey. \n\nWhat are the natural endowments required for moral expertise, and how\nwidely are they distributed in the population? If they are rare, like\nthe skill of a chess master or the strength of an NFL lineman, virtue\nwill also be rare. Some virtue ethicists believe virtue should be\nwidely attainable, and they will resist this result (Adams 2006:\n119\u2013123, and arguably Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics\n1099b15\u201320). But even virtue ethicists who embrace the rarity of\nvirtue require an account of what the necessary natural endowments\nare, and if they wish to also have an account of how the less\nwell-endowed may achieve at least minimal decency, they should have\nsomething to say about how moral development will proceed across a\npopulation with widely varying endowments.\n\nWhat is needed, for the study of moral character research to advance,\nis an account of the biological, psychological, and social factors\nrequisite for successful moral development\u2014on the expertise\nmodel, the conditions conducive to developing \u201cmoral\nskill\u201d. This, quite obviously, is a tall order, and the research\nneeded to systematically address these issue is in comparative\ninfancy. Yet the expertise model, in exploiting connections with areas\nin which skill acquisition has been well studied, such as music and\nsport, provides a framework for moving discussion of character beyond\nthe empirically under-informed conjectures and assumptions about\n\u201chabituation\u201d that have been too frequent in previous\nliterature (Doris 2015: 128).\n",
