    "main_text": "\n\nSkepticism about moral responsibility, or what is more commonly\nreferred to as moral responsibility skepticism, refers to a\nfamily of views that all take seriously the possibility that human\nbeings are never morally responsible for their actions in a particular\nbut pervasive sense. This sense is typically set apart by the notion\nof basic desert and is defined in terms of the control in\naction needed for an agent to be truly deserving of blame and\npraise. Some moral responsibility skeptics wholly reject this notion\nof moral responsibility because they believe it to be incoherent or\nimpossible. Others maintain that, though possible, our best\nphilosophical and scientific theories about the world provide strong\nand compelling reasons for adopting skepticism about moral\nresponsibility. What all varieties of moral responsibility skepticism\nshare, however, is the belief that the justification needed to ground\nbasic desert moral responsibility and the practices associated with\nit\u2014such as backward-looking praise and blame, punishment and\nreward (including retributive punishment), and the reactive attitudes\nof resentment and indignation\u2014is not met. Versions of moral\nresponsibility skepticism have historically been defended by Spinoza,\nVoltaire, Diderot, d\u2019Holbach, Priestley, Schopenhauer,\nNietzsche, Clarence Darrow, B.F. Skinner, and Paul Edwards, and more\nrecently by Galen Strawson, Derk Pereboom, Bruce Waller, Neil Levy,\nTamler Sommers, and Gregg D. Caruso. \n\nCritics of these views tend to focus both on the arguments for\nskepticism about moral responsibility and on the implications\nof such views. They worry that adopting such a view would have dire\nconsequences for our interpersonal relationships, society, morality,\nmeaning, and the law. They fear, for instance, that relinquishing\nbelief in moral responsibility would undermine morality, leave us\nunable to adequately deal with criminal behavior, increase anti-social\nconduct, and destroy meaning in life. Optimistic skeptics,\nhowever, respond by arguing that life without free will and basic\ndesert moral responsibility would not be as destructive as many people\nbelieve. These optimistic skeptics argue that prospects of finding\nmeaning in life or of sustaining good interpersonal relationships, for\ninstance, would not be threatened. They further maintain that morality\nand moral judgments would remain intact. And although retributivism\nand severe punishment, such as the death penalty, would be ruled out,\nthey argue that the imposition of sanctions could serve purposes other\nthan the punishment of the guilty\u2014e.g., it can also be justified\nby its role in incapacitating, rehabilitating, and deterring\noffenders.\n",
