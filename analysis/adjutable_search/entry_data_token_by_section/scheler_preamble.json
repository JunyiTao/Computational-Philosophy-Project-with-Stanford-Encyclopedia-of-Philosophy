    "main_text": "\n\nAt the time of his death, Max Ferdinand Scheler was one of the most\nprominent German intellectuals and most sought after philosophers of\nhis time. A pioneer in the development of phenomenology in the early\npart of the 20th century, Scheler broke new ground in many\nareas of philosophy and established himself as perhaps the most\ncreative of the early phenomenologists. Relative to the attention his\nwork received and the attention his contemporaries now enjoy, interest\nin Scheler\u2019s work and thought has waned considerably. This\ndecrease in attention is in part due to the suppression of\nScheler\u2019s work by the Nazis from 1933 to 1945, a suppression\nstemming from his Jewish heritage and outspoken denunciation of\nfascism and National Socialism. Nevertheless, his work has survived\nand continues to be read and translated throughout the world, serving\nas evidence of the creative depth and richness of his thought.\n",
