    "main_text": "Action and Mind || Ontology and Logical Form\n2.4 Ontology and Logical Form\n\nDavidson\u2019s accounts of action and of mind call upon a\nwell-developed set of analyses concerning psychological concepts such\nas belief, desire and intention \u2013 concepts whose analysis is\ntaken further in a number of papers that follow on from, and develop\nor modify, the ideas first set out in \u2018Actions, Reasons and\nCauses\u2019 (papers such as \u2018Agency\u2019 (1971) and\n\u2018Intending\u2019 [1978a]) as well as in Davidson\u2019s\ndiscussions of epistemological and semantic issues (see below). But\nDavidson \u2018s work in this area is also dependent on his account\nof the notions of cause, event, and law and, in particular, on his\ndefence of the view that events are particulars and so constitute a\nfundamental ontological category. If events are indeed particulars,\nthen an important question concerns the conditions of identity for\nevents. In \u2018The Individuation of Events\u2019 [1969a] Davidson\nargues that events are identical if and only if they have identical\ncauses and effects. In \u2018Reply to Quine on Events\u2019 [1985b]\nhe abandons this criterion in favour of the Quinean suggestion that\nevents are identical if and only if they occupy exactly the same\nlocation in space and time.\n\nA characteristic feature of Davidson\u2019s approach to such\nontological questions has been to focus on the logical structure of\nsentences about the entities at issue rather than on those entities as\nsuch. Davidson\u2019s approach to events, for instance, is grounded\nin an analysis of the underlying logical form of sentences about\nevents; in the case of causal relations, in an analysis of the logical\nform of sentences that express such relations (see \u2018Causal\nRelations\u2019 [1967a]); and in his approach to action also,\nDavidson\u2019s approach involves an analysis of the logical form of\nsentences about actions (see \u2018The Logical Form of Action\nSentences\u2019 [1967b]). This reflects a more general commitment on\nDavidson\u2019s part to the inseparability of questions of ontology\nfrom questions of logic. This commitment is spelt out explicitly in\n\u2018The Method of Truth in Metaphysics\u2019 (1977) and it\nprovides a further point of connection between Davidson\u2019s work\nin the philosophy of action, event and mind and his work on questions\nof meaning and language.\n",
