    "main_text": "Specific Consciousness || Neural Representation and Probabilistic Coding\n5.4 Neural Representation and Probabilistic Coding\n\nIn invoking neural content, the assumption is that neural content\nmirrors perceptual content, so that if one is experiencing dots moving\nin a certain direction, there is a neural representation with the same\ncontent. This is a simplification and does not cohere with a common\ncurrent approach to neural content that takes it to be\nprobabilistic. Consider again the tuning curve from an MT\nneuron, M\n (figure 5).\n\nIf asked to assign a determinate content to M, one might choose\nthe value that corresponds to its peak response, here,\n 0o.[16]\n This would be the most natural option if the tuning curve were\nessentially a sharp line at 0o, i.e., were the neuron only\nactive for its preferred stimulus but otherwise not. Of course, that\nis not the neuron\u2019s response profile, so what is the content of\nthe neural representation?\n\nOne approach that converges on a determinate content considers the\nactivity of a neural population. To evaluate more information, the\nbrain might integrate MT response by giving each MT neuron, \\(M_n\\),\none vote weighted according to the strength of its response.\nThus, the tuning curve represents how strongly the neuron votes for\nits preferred value (the value at the peak). The votes are tallied by\na downstream system, and the result can be represented as a\npopulation vector whose direction is understood to be the\ndirection represented by the neural population. This specific approach\nwas taken by Georgopoulos and colleagues to decode the direction of\nbodily movement from the activity of a population of motor neurons\n(Georgopoulos et al. 1982; for discussion of different coding\napproaches, see Pouget, Dayan, & Zemel 2003).\n\nIn recent perceptual neuroscience, an alternative picture of neural\nrepresentational content often tied to Bayesian approaches to\nperceptual computation has gained traction (for accessible\ndiscussions, see Colombo & Seri\u00e8s 2012; Rescorla 2015). On\nBayesian models, extracting information from populations of (say) MT\nneurons does not yield a specific value of motion direction but rather\na probability density function, across the space of possible\nmotion directions (for a philosophical discussion of neural\nprobabilistic codes, see Shea 2014). A key idea is not the generation\nof specific values as what neurons represent, say 0 degree motion as\nproposed earlier, but rather the conceptualization of the population\nresponse as reflecting uncertainty inherent in neural activity given\nnoise.\n\nIf we plot the activity of all MT neurons responding to a specific\nmotion stimulus, one hypothesis is that the population response codes\nthe likelihood, \\(\\pP(r\\mid s)\\), namely the conditional\nprobability that one has the observed MT response r given the\nstimulus s. A Bayesian approach to neural population codes then\nunderstands neural processing to involve computation of the\nposterior probability, \\(\\pP(s\\mid r)\\) from the likelihood\nand prior knowledge of the probability of the stimulus \\(\\pP(s)\\) in\naccordance with Bayes Theorem (this is normalized so that the\nprobabilities sum to one). The details of Bayesian computation need\nnot concern us since our main concern is with the possibility of\nneural content as probabilistic, something that seems counterintuitive\nrelative to the approach illustrated by Georgopoulos and\ncolleagues.\n\nKnill and Pouget contrast the two approaches:\n\n\nThis is the basic premise on which Bayesian theories of cortical\nprocessing will succeed or fail\u2014that the brain represents\ninformation probabilistically, by coding and computing with\nprobability density functions or approximations to probability density\nfunctions\u2026The opposing view is that neural representations are\ndeterministic and discrete, which might be intuitive but also\nmisleading. This intuition might be due to the apparent\n\u2018oneness\u2019 of our perceptual world and the need to\n\u2018collapse\u2019 perceptual representations into discrete\nactions, such as decisions or motor behaviors. (Knill & Pouget\n2004)\n\n\nHow might a probabilistic account of neural representation affect our\nthinking about phenomenal consciousness via neural\nrepresentationalism? Consider this possibility: What if probabilistic\ncontent is pervasive? Pouget, Dayan and Zemel note:\n\n\ndecoding is not an essential neurobiological operation because there\nis almost never a reason to decode the stimulus explicitly. Rather,\nthe population code is used to support computations involving\ns, whose outputs are represented in the form of yet more\npopulation codes over the same or different collections of neurons.\n(2003: 385)\n\n\nPut another way, the determinacy is apparent only at the output stage,\nthe goal of processing. In the case of motor action, neural content is\nprobabilistic until the actual movement when a determinate path is\nimplemented in a specific movement trajectory.\n\nYet perceptual content does not seem probabilistic. This\nemphasizes a prima facie disconnect between current theories\nof neural content and those of phenomenal content. The linking\nprinciples we have deployed assume a specific view of neural content\nthat might not cohere with current approaches to neural coding,\nleaving us with the challenge of explanatorily linking probabilistic\ncontent at the neural level with more determinate, nonprobabilistic\ncontent at the phenomenal level. One option is to find\nnonprobabilistic content at the neural level (e.g., as in the\npopulation vector approach). The other is to find probabilistic\ncontent at the phenomenal level (for related ideas, see Morrison 2017\nand response by Denison 2017; also Block 2018). Either way,\nexplanations of specific content will need to deal with this prima\nfacie disconnect between phenomenal content as revealed by\nintrospection and current theories of neural content.\n",
