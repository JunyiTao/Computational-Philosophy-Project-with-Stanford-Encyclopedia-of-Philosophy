    "main_text": "A Particular Intensional Logic\n3. A Particular Intensional Logic\n\n\nAs has been noted several times earlier, formal intensional logics\nhave been developed with a full hierarchy of higher types, Church, \nMontague, Bressan, Tich\u00fd for instance. Such logics can be rather\nformidable, but Carnap\u2019s ideas are often (certainly not always) at the\nheart of such logics, these ideas are simple, and are sufficient to\nallow discussion of several common intensional problems. Somehow,\nbased on its sense (intension, meaning) a designating phrase may\ndesignate different things under different conditions\u2014in\ndifferent states. For instance, \u201cthe number of the\nplanets\u201d was believed to designate 6 in ancient times (counting\nEarth). Immediately after the discovery of Uranus in 1781 \u201cthe\nnumber of the planets\u201d was believed to designate 7. If we take\nas epistemic states of affairs the universe as conceived by the\nancients, and the universe as conceived just after 1781, in one state\n\u201cthe number of the planets\u201d designates 6 and in the other\nit designates 7. In neither state were people wrong about the concept\nof planet, but about the state of affairs constituting the\nuniverse. If we suppress all issues of how meanings are determined,\nhow meanings in turn pick out references, and all issues of what\ncounts as a possible state of affairs, that is, if we abstract all\nthis away, the common feature of every designating term is that\ndesignation may change from state to state\u2014thus it can be\nformalized by a function from states to objects. This bare-bones\napproach is quite enough to deal with many otherwise intractable\nproblems.\n\n\nIn order to keep things simple, we do not consider a full type\nhierarchy\u2014first-order is enough to get the basics across. The\nfirst-order fragment of the logic of Gallin 1975 would be sufficient,\nfor instance. The particular formulation presented here comes from\nFitting 2004, extending Fitting and Mendelsohn 1998. Predicate\nletters are intensional, as they are in every version of Kripke-style\nsemantics, with interpretations that depend on possible worlds. The\nonly other intensional item considered here is that of individual\nconcept\u2014formally represented by constants and variables that can\ndesignate different objects in different possible worlds. The same\nideas can be extended to higher types, but what the ideas contribute\ncan already be seen at this relatively simple level. Intensional\nlogics often have nothing but intensions\u2014extensions are inferred\nbut are not explicit. However, an approach that is too minimal can\nmake life hard, so consequently here we explicitly allow both objects\nand individual concepts which range over objects. There are two kinds\nof quantification, over each of these sorts. Both extensional and\nintensional objects are first-class citizens.\n\n\nBasic ideas are presented semantically rather than\nproof-theoretically, though both axiom systems\nand tableau systems exist. Even so, technical details can become baroque,\nso as far as possible, we will separate informal presentation, which\nis enough to get the general idea, from its formal counterpart, which\nis of more specialized interest. A general acquaintance with modal\nlogic is assumed (though there is a very brief discussion to establish\nnotation, which varies some from author to author). It should be noted\nthat modal semantics is used here, and generally, in two different\nways. Often one has a particular Kripke model in mind, though it may\nbe specified informally. For instance, we might consider a Kripke\nmodel in which the states are the present instant and all past ones,\nwith later states accessible from earlier ones. Such a model is\nenlightening when discussing \u201cthe King of France\u201d for\ninstance, even though the notion of instant is somewhat vaguely\ndetermined. But besides this use of informally specified concrete\nmodels, there is formal Kripke semantics which is a mathematically\nprecise thing. If it is established that something, say\n\\(\\Box (X \\supset Y) \\supset (\\Box X \\supset \\Box Y)\\), is valid in all formal Kripke models, we can\nassume it will be so in our vaguely specified, intuitive models, no\nmatter how we attempt to make them more precise. Informal models\npervade our discussions\u2014their fundamental properties come from\nthe formal semantics.\n",
