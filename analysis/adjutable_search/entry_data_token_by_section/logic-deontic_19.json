    "main_text": "Revising the Foundations of Deontic Logic || Hyperintensionality of Deontic Modals and Truthmaker Semantics\n7. Conclusion\n\nPlainly, there are a number of outstanding problems for deontic logic.\nSome see this as a serious defect; others see it merely as a serious\nchallenge, even an attractive one. There is some antecedent reason to\nexpect that the challenges will be great in this area. Normativity is\nchallenging generally, not just in deontic logic. Normative notions\nappear to have strong pragmatic features. Normative notions must\ncombine with notions for agency and with temporal notions to be of\nmaximal interest\u2014which introduces considerable logical\ncomplexity. There is also reason to think that there are hidden\ncomplexities in the interaction of normative notions and conditionals.\nFinally, there appears to be a wide array of normative notions with\ninteresting interactions, some easily conflated with others (by\nethicists as much as deontic logicians). Clearly, there is a lot of\nwork to be done.\n",
