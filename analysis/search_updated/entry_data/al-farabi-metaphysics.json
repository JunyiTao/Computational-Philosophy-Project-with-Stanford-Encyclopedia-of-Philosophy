    "main_text": "\n1. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s project of reviving the sciences of the ancients\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does metaphysics, not by writing a commentary\non Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, but by trying to\nreconstruct Aristotle\u2019s aims and demonstrative method and to\nwrite the book that Aristotle would have written had he been writing\nin Arabic for a largely Muslim readership. This is a part of\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s approach to the \u201csciences of\nthe ancients\u201d, i.e., to Greek philosophy, mathematics, and\nmedicine, with all their sub-disciplines. A brief summary follows but,\nfor a fuller account, see\n Supplement: F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s project of reviving the sciences of the ancients.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, more than any other medieval philosopher,\ndistrusts the surface appearance of Greek philosophy as presented to\nhim in the Arabic translations. He tries to go beyond this surface to\nreconstruct the ancient authors\u2019 aims and methods, and even to\nreconstruct the structure of their Greek expressions, which he\nsuspects have been badly served by the Arabic translations. In some\ncases the Greek texts he is interested in were not available to him\neven in Arabic translation, but only in translations of later ancient\nsummaries or descriptions, but this does not stop him from trying to\nreconstruct their underlying thought. (He has access to translations\nof almost all of the texts of Aristotle that we have now, but\napparently to none of the texts of Plato.) He thinks this is worth the\neffort because he thinks that the Greeks, especially Plato and\nAristotle, developed sciences which have since decayed or have been\ntransmitted only imperfectly to the Arabic-writing Muslim-ruled lands,\nbut which it is still possible to reconstruct and to apply to the\nurgent questions of his own time.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is particularly interested in applying the\n\u201csciences of the ancients\u201d, and particularly metaphysics,\nto resolve the issues addressed and disputed by the \u201creligious\nsciences\u201d within Islam, especially kal\u00e2m or\n\u201cdialectical theology\u201d. These issues include whether the\nworld was created in time or has existed from eternity, proofs of\nGod\u2019s existence and of his having no partner or contrary,\nGod\u2019s attributes (knowledge, power, will \u2026) and his\naction in creating the world, and how his causality relates to the\ncausality of creatures. (F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee systematically\naddresses these issues, as well as kal\u00e2m issues about\nprophecy, the religious community, and the \u201creturn\u201d or\nafterlife, in his Principles of the Opinions of the Perfect\nCity: see\n Section 4\n below.) F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that the arguments about\nthese issues within the Muslim community (and other religious\ncommunities within the Muslim world) have been merely dialectical, so\nthat it is equally possible to argue on both sides of each issue. He\nthinks that if the sciences of the ancients, especially metaphysics,\ncan be reconstructed and practiced according to a demonstrative\nmethod, they will be able to resolve these disputes. He thinks,\nhowever, that earlier philosophers in the Muslim world, in practicing\nwhat they saw as Platonic or Aristotelian philosophy, have argued\nsub-demonstratively, and so have been unable to resolve the disputes.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee claims to be the first person in the Muslim\nworld to have mastered Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics\nand so recaptured Aristotle\u2019s demonstrative method. And he\nclaims to be the first to have understood Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, and to have mastered the science of being and\nits universal attributes which gives the only scientific foundation\nfor making judgments about God and his causality.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee and his contemporaries use the word\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d (in Arabic \u201cfalsafa\u201d),\nborrowed from the Greek, only for those schools and disciplines that\npresent themselves as continuing ancient Greek philosophy. Before\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s time this kind of philosophy was\nmainly practiced, in the Muslim world, by Christians, often\nSyriac-Arabic bilinguals (and almost all the translators of Greek\ntexts were Christian); although Christian philosophers also had Muslim\nand Jewish students, and although some Isma\u02bfili Shi\u02bfites had\nintegrated a version of Greek philosophy into their ideal of what the\nimam must know. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee wants to break the\nassociation of philosophy with particular (and often marginalized)\nlinguistic and religious communities. The Arabic grammarian\nS\u00eer\u00e2f\u00ee had accused F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nChristian teacher Ab\u00fb Bishr Matt\u00e2 of presenting as\nuniversal rules of logic, normative for any rational being, what were\nsimply rules of Greek grammar, as translated from Greek through Syriac\ninto Arabic and probably damaged in translation. Against this charge,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee wants to show that logic, and philosophy is\ngeneral, is not community-bound like Arabic grammar or Muslim\nkal\u00e2m. Logic is to thought as the grammar of a\nparticular language is to that language: its rules apply to all\nthought insofar as it is correct, whatever language it may be\nexpressed in, and they give the common core shared by all languages,\nabstracted from the merely conventional and community-relative aspects\nof particular languages. And philosophy is to religion as logic is to\ngrammar, giving rules for how to think about God and the physical\nworld and human beings, and therefore for how to act to achieve the\naim of human life, which apply to all humans insofar as they reason\nand act correctly; and these rules give the common core of doctrines\nand practical prescriptions shared by all religions, or at least by a\nplurality of correct religions, abstracted from the merely\nconventional and community-relative aspects of particular\nreligions.\n2. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee on metaphysics as a science and Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee aims to revive the sciences of the ancients,\nespecially the philosophical disciplines practiced by Plato and\nAristotle, to replace the (as he thinks) non-demonstrative disciplines\nof his contemporaries, and to resolve their otherwise interminable\ndisputes. This centrally includes a project of reviving scientific\nmetaphysics, because metaphysics (rather than physics or other\nsciences) offers the hope of a scientific demonstration that God\nexists and has no partner or contrary, and a scientific resolution of\nthe kal\u00e2m issues about God\u2019s attributes and acts,\nand the relation of God\u2019s acts to creatures and their\n acts.[1]\n Perhaps metaphysics can also determine whether the human soul, or\nsome part of it, survives death, and thus can resolve the\nkal\u00e2m issue about our \u201creturn\u201d to God. But\nalso, apart from whatever metaphysics may say about immortality,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks, following Aristotle, that the highest\nhuman happiness consists in the contemplation of God, so that\nmetaphysics will describe the content of our possible\nhappiness after death, and will come as close as we can come to\nanticipating it in this life.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee did not write any one systematic work on\nmetaphysics, corresponding to Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics,\nalthough his Book of Letters and On the One and\nUnity, taken together, stand in a close relation to some parts\nand aspects of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, and parts of\nhis Principles of the Opinions of the People of the Perfect\nCity and On the Political Constitution stand in close\nrelations to other parts and aspects of the Metaphysics\n(other parts of these treatises are closer to other Greek models).\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s starting-point in trying to revive\nthe science of metaphysics and to reconstruct and imitate its\nclassical texts (above all Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics) is\nhis discussion of the \u201caim\u201d or \u201cobject\u201d\n[Arabic ghara\u1e0d = Greek skopos] of metaphysics.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes over late ancient philosophers\u2019\nassumptions that each of Aristotle\u2019s treatises is devoted to\nteaching some one science, and that each science (and the treatise\nteaching it) has some one \u201caim\u201d, such that everything the\nscience treats is somehow related to that aim. Thus the\n\u201caim\u201d of medicine is health: the science of medicine also\ndiscusses, for instance, anatomy and pathology and pharmacology, but\nonly because they are somehow related to health. Much of\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s discussion of Aristotle\u2019s texts\npicks up late ancient discussions of what science each text transmits,\nthe \u201caim\u201d of the science and the text, how those sciences\nfunction together to attain the human good and what role each text can\nplay in that larger undertaking. In order to reconstruct what\nAristotle would say now, instead of what he said in Greek in the\nMetaphysics, if he were addressing a different linguistic and\nreligious community in a different historical situation,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee must start by understanding the aim of\nmetaphysics as a science and how each book of the Metaphysics\nis directed toward attaining that aim. He gives surveys of the Greek\nsciences in his Enumeration of the Sciences and\nAttainment of Happiness, and of Aristotle\u2019s works in\nthe Philosophy of Aristotle, all of which include brief\ndiscussions of metaphysics; he also has a brief discussion of\nmetaphysics and its relation to some other sciences in his Book of\nLetters, and he writes an entire short treatise On the aims\nof the Sage in each book of the treatise which is called the Book of\nLetters, that is, the determination of Aristotle\u2019s aim in his\ntreatise the Metaphysics (for short, On the Aims of the\nMetaphysics). In the bulk of the Book of Letters and\nOn the One and Unity he is not talking about\nmetaphysics as a science or about Aristotle\u2019s text, but rather\nimitating Aristotle in practicing this science. Some of On the\nAims of the Metaphysics is also imitating Aristotle, since, in\ndescribing the distinction between the different theoretical sciences\n(physics, mathematics, metaphysics) and the different things that\nmetaphysics considers, he is imitating Aristotle\u2019s discussion in\nMetaphysics VI,1.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee starts On the Aims of the\nMetaphysics by saying:\n\n\nOur intention in this book is to indicate the aim that is contained in\nthe treatise of Aristotle called Metaphysics, and [to\nindicate] its primary divisions. For many people have followed their\nfancy that the meaning and content of this treatise is the account of\nthe Creator (glory be to Him and be He exalted!) and the intelligence\nand the soul and the other things that are related to these, and that\nthe science of metaphysics and the science of\n theology[2]\n are one and the same. And thus we find that most of those who\ninvestigate [this treatise] are confused and go astray, since we find\nthat most of the account in it lacks this aim, indeed we do not find\nin it any special discussion of this aim except what is in the\neleventh book, which bears the sign lam [L or\n \u039b].[3]\n\n\nHere F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is referring to the discussion, which\nArabic writers had inherited from late ancient Greek commentators,\nabout the aim of the Metaphysics, or equivalently about what\nthe science of metaphysics is about: Aristotle himself does not use\nthe word or phrase\n \u201cmetaphysics\u201d,[4]\n but he speaks both of \u201cwisdom\n [sophia]\u201d[5]\n and of \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d, and Greek and Arabic\ncommentators assume that \u201cwisdom\u201d and \u201cfirst\nphilosophy\u201d are different names for the same science, and that\nthe Metaphysics as a whole is dedicated to this science,\nwhich can therefore also be called \u201cmetaphysics\u201d. For two\nreasons, there is an inherited problem about what this science is\nabout. The first reason is that Aristotle in different places says\ndifferent, not obviously compatible, things about what this science is\nabout: notably, in the Metaphysics I,1\u20132 he says that\nwisdom is the science of first causes and principles; in\nMetaphysics VI,1 and in several texts outside the\nMetaphysics he says that first philosophy is the science of\ndivine things (which he calls \u201ctheology\u201d) or the science\nof eternally unchangeable separately existing\n things;[6]\n in Metaphysics IV,1\u20132 he says that there is a science\nof being as such and its attributes, and in Metaphysics VI,1\nhe apparently identifies that science with first philosophy or\ntheology; and in Metaphysics IV,2 he also identifies the\nscience of being as such with the science of substance. So the\ncommentators try in different ways to reconcile these different things\nthat Aristotle says about wisdom or first philosophy. The second\nreason that there is a problem is that what Aristotle actually\ndoes in the different books of the Metaphysics does\nnot obviously fit with what he says that wisdom or first\nphilosophy will do. If, as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says here,\n\u201cmost people\u201d have concluded that \u201cthe meaning and\ncontent of this treatise is the account of the Creator \u2026 and\nthe intelligence and the soul and the other things that are related to\nthese\u201d\u2014i.e., an account of things that can be argued to be\neternal and separable from matter\u2014this is not because (as\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee puts it here) they have simply\n\u201cfollowed their fancy\u201d, or because they have confused\nGreek metaphysics with Islamic kal\u00e2m. Rather, it is\nbecause Aristotle repeatedly says that first philosophy is a\nscience of separate eternally unchanging things. The problem is that,\nas F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, most of the Metaphysics\noutside of Book XII (indeed, outside of roughly the second half of\nBook XII) does not seem to be talking about such things, except\ninasmuch as Metaphysics XIII\u2013XIV try to refute other\nphilosophers\u2019 candidates for separate eternally unchanging\nthings, namely Platonic Forms and mathematical objects. So\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s problem in On the Aims of the\nMetaphysics will not be simply to find a way of reconciling the\ndifferent things Aristotle says about wisdom or first\nphilosophy and show how these can all be referring to the same\nscience, but also to say what Aristotle actually does in each\nbook of the Metaphysics and to show how it contributes to\nthis science.\n\nIn his Enumeration of the Sciences F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ngives a description of \u201cthe divine science\u201d (corresponding\nto Aristotle\u2019s word \u201ctheology\u201d in\nMetaphysics VI,1, and his description of wisdom as\n\u201cdivine science\u201d in Metaphysics I,2), crowning\nhis previous descriptions of mathematics and physics. Here\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says the divine science is divided into three\nparts. The first part investigates \u201cbeings and the things that\nbelong to them inasmuch as they are beings\u201d: this reflects\nAristotle\u2019s programmatic declaration in Metaphysics\nIV,1. The second part, says F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, investigates\n(i.e., establishes) the principles of the particular sciences, and\nalso investigates (i.e., refutes) false opinions of earlier\nphilosophers about the principles of these sciences, among which\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee mentions the opinion that mathematical\nobjects are separately existing substances: the latter would reflect\nMetaphysics\n XIII\u2013XIV,[7]\n but F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is probably also thinking of the\nrefutation in Metaphysics IV,3\u20138 of people who deny the\nprinciple of noncontradiction. (There is little support in Aristotle\nfor the idea that metaphysics establishes principles of other\nsciences, except for universal axioms like noncontradiction and\nexcluded middle, but this idea can be found in late ancient\ncommentators. Aristotle does accept cases where one science can\nestablish principles that are assumed in another science\u2014for\ninstance, number theory establishes principles that are assumed in\nmathematical music theory, and geometry establishes principles that\nare used in astronomy and optics\u2014and Porphyry says that\nmetaphysics is related to physics in this\n way.)[8]\n The third part of the \u201cdivine science\u201d\u2014and here\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has much more to say\u2014shows that there\nare beings which neither are bodies nor exist in bodies, that these\nbeings are not one but many, and not infinitely but finitely many, and\nthat they do not all share the same degree of perfection, but rather\nsome are superior and others inferior. This then leads to the\nconclusion that these beings separate from bodies culminate in some\nfirst being which has nothing prior to it and thus has no further\ncause of its existence. And, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, this\nscience shows that this being also has no partner (nothing sharing its\ndegree of perfection) and no contrary; that there is no multiplicity\nin it in any way, and that it is one, being, and true in a stronger\nsense than everything else; and that it is the first cause which\nbestows being, unity and truth on everything else. Then,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, this science shows that this being\ndeserves the name \u201cGod\u201d, and satisfies the rest of the\ndivine attributes; and then it shows how other beings arise from God\nand how they form an ordered hierarchy (some beings arise from God\ndirectly, others indirectly through these), explains how God acts on\nother things, and refutes the false opinion that God is responsible\nfor evils. The description of this third part of the \u201cdivine\nscience\u201d reads like an analytical table of contents for much of\nwhat F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does in his Principles of the\nOpinions of the People of the Perfect City and Political\nRegime, but it is not closely related to anything in Aristotle.\nAt best, it is an enormously expanded version of some things that\nAristotle covers very quickly in Metaphysics XII,6\u201310:\nXII,6 shows that there are separate incorporeal substances, XII,7\njustifies the name \u201cgod\u201d, XII,8 argues that there is a\nfinite multiplicity of such substances but only one first among them,\nand then XII,10 identifies this first principle with the good itself\nand argues (very sketchily) that it is the cause of good order in the\ncosmos and that there is no evil principle contrary to it. Aristotle\ndoes not seem to say in Metaphysics XII that the first\nprinciple is one, being, and true in a stronger sense than everything\nelse, or that it bestows being, unity and truth on everything else\n(the best support for this view might be Metaphysics II,1\n993b23\u201331). But the more serious problem is that\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee here just gives a list of the things that the\nscience will investigate or prove, without explaining why these tasks\nall belong to the same science, and without explaining what principles\nthe science can draw on to demonstrate all these conclusions. His\naccount here looks like a wish-list of what he would like the science\nto do, especially as a Greek scientific alternative to Islamic\nkal\u00e2m, but it does not explain how a science can do all\nthis. Rather than solving the inherited problem of how a single\nscience can meet the different descriptions that Aristotle gives of\nwisdom or first philosophy, he aggravates the problem by adding more\nthings that the science must\n do.[9]\n\nIn On the Aims of the Metaphysics, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ntries to resolve the tension between \u201contological\u201d and\n\u201ctheological\u201d descriptions of metaphysics (science of\nbeings universally, vs. science of God or of separate immaterial\nsubstances), and the tension between Aristotle\u2019s mostly\n\u201ctheological\u201d descriptions of his task and his\nmostly \u201contological\u201d practice in the\nMetaphysics, in two fundamental ways.\n\nFirst, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes up Aristotle\u2019s contrast,\nin Metaphysics IV,1 and VI,1, between metaphysics and the\n\u201cparticular sciences\u201d such as physics and the mathematical\ndisciplines, each of which takes some one genus of beings and\ninvestigates what can be said of the things in that genus. By\ncontrast, says F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee,\n\n\nuniversal science is that which investigates what is common to all the\nthings that are, such as being and unity, and its kinds and its\nattributes, and things which are not accidents [proper to] any of the\nsubjects of the particular sciences, [i.e., things] like priority and\nposteriority and potency and act and the perfect and the deficient and\nwhat is like these, and the common principle of all the things that\nare: this is the thing that must be called by the name of\n God.[10]\n\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that there can be only one such\nuniversal science, because sciences are individuated by their\nsubject-domains: if there are two sciences, such that the\nsubject-domain of one includes something that is not within the\nsubject-domain of the other, then at least the second science is not a\nuniversal science; so any two universal sciences would have the same\nsubject-domain, and would therefore be the same science. So a\nuniversal science, if there is one, would be a science of being as\nsuch, and also of unity if (as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says,\nfollowing Aristotle in Metaphysics IV,2) unity is coextensive\nwith being, and also of any attributes (more literally\n\u201cconsequences\u201d) of being or unity, i.e., predicates that\ncan be shown to apply to every existing thing just because it exists\nor because it is one. (Since F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee cites pairs like\n\u201cthe perfect and the deficient\u201d, he apparently means to\ninclude, not just attributes that apply to all beings, but also pairs\nof attributes that apply disjunctively to all beings, in something\nlike the way that even and odd apply disjunctively to all numbers.)\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not argue here that there is a universal\nscience, beyond saying that \u201cit does not belong to any of [the\nparticular sciences] to investigate what is common to all the things\nthat are\u201d. Perhaps his view is that there is at least something\nto investigate here, namely \u201cwhat, if anything, is common to all\nthe things that are?\u201d. If that investigation yields no answer,\nor a negative answer, then there is no universal science; if we\ndiscover, for some value of P, that P belongs\nuniversally to all the things that are, then that proposition and the\narguments for it belong to the universal science, so there is a\nuniversal science. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is not assuming that being\nis univocal and so constitutes a single genus. He says in On the\nAims that Aristotle in Metaphysics V investigates\nwhether the terms for being and its attributes are univocal or not,\nand in his Book of Letters (see \n  Section 3 below) he says that\nbeing is not univocal, but is said of substances primarily and of\nother things derivatively. So if all beings have some attribute\nP, it will be because substances are P primarily,\nand other beings are P because substances are; but this is\nstill enough for \u201call beings are P\u201d to be a\ntheorem of the universal science.\n\nWe have seen that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee lists God as one of the\nthings investigated by the universal science. God is investigated by\nthe science that \u201cinvestigates what is common to all the things\nthat are\u201d because God is \u201cthe common principle of all the\nthings that are\u201d: he belongs to all beings in common, not\nbecause he is an attribute predicated of all beings, but because he is\na cause of all beings. More precisely, he is a cause of all beings\nqu\u00e2 being: that is, he is a cause, to the things that\nare, of the fact that they are, rather than of other facts\nabout them. As F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says a bit further down,\n\n\nthe divine science must enter into this science, since God is the\nprinciple of being simpliciter, not of one being as\ndistinguished from another being. And the division which gives the\nprinciple of being must be the divine science, since these concepts\nare not proper to physics but are higher than physics in generality.\nSo this science is higher than the science of nature, and\nafter the science of nature, and for this reason it should be\ncalled the science of metaphysics [lit. the science of what is after\nnature].\n\n\nHere F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is taking a stand on an issue that was\ncontroversial among Aristotelians, by saying that we do not come to\nknow God through the science of physics, even though Aristotle argues\nin his Physics 8 that the eternal circular motions are caused\nby eternally unmoved movers. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is saying that\nthe right way to come to know God is as a cause of existence rather\nthan as a cause of motion. On the face of it, this could be taken in\ntwo ways. (a) Perhaps F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee means that God is both\na cause of existence (to everything) and a cause of motion (to the\nthings that move, i.e., to bodies rather than to incorporeal\nsubstances), but that the right way to gain scientific knowledge of\nGod is to know him as the cause of existence.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s reason might be that, when we know\nabout God that he is a first cause of motion (an unmoved mover), we do\nnot thereby know what God is, since what God is must\napply only to God, and there are many unmoved movers, of the many\ncircular motions in the heavens. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\npoint may be that there is only one first cause of existence (although\nmany first causes of motion), and knowing about God that he is a first\ncause of existence gives us knowledge of what God is. (b) In\nfact, however, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that the first cause of\nexistence is prior to the first cause of motion in a stronger sense:\nknowing the first cause of motion does not give us knowledge of God,\nbecause God is not a cause of motion at all. On\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s account in the Perfect City\nand Political Regime, God is not the first of the unmoved\nmovers, but is rather a cause of existence to the unmoved movers and\nthus indirectly to everything else. So an ascent to the first cause of\nmotion does not get us to God at all, but only to some lower being:\nonly a study of the causes of being will get us to God.\n\nSo far, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s description of metaphysics is\nontological: theology is part of metaphysics, because theology is part\nof the study of being, namely the study of the first cause of\nexistence. This allows F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee to reconcile\nAristotle\u2019s saying in Metaphysics VI,1 that first\nphilosophy is a science of being qu\u00e2 being with his saying in\nthe same chapter that first philosophy is theology. Unfortunately,\nthis solution seems to conflict with something else Aristotle says in\nthe same chapter, namely that\n\n\nphysics is about things that are inseparate but not unmoved, some of\nmathematics about things that are unmoved, but probably not separate\nbut rather existing in matter, whereas first philosophy is about\nthings that are both separate and unmoved.\n (1026a13\u201316)[11]\n\n\nThis seems to mean, not just that the study of things that are\nseparate and unmoved belongs to first philosophy, but that first\nphilosophy is defined as the science of things that are\nseparate and unmoved. How then is first philosophy the science of\nbeing and its universal attributes? One possible answer would be that\nfirst philosophy is by definition the science of God (or perhaps the\nscience of separate unmoved things including God), and that it studies\nbeing and its universal attributes instrumentally, because starting\nwith them and investigating their causes is the only way we have to\ncome to knowledge of God. (This might imply that those aspects of the\nstudy of being and its universal attributes which are not useful for\ndrawing conclusions about God would not belong to first\nphilosophy.) But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives a different answer, by\nreinterpreting what Aristotle means by \u201cseparate\u201d. This is\nthe second way that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee tries to resolve\nthe tension between ontological and theological descriptions of\nmetaphysics.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee infers from the universality of the science\nhe has described, including its investigation of God as the cause of\nexistence universally, that\n\n\nthis science is higher than the science of nature, and after\nthe science of nature, and for this reason it should be called the\nscience of metaphysics [i.e., literally, the science of what is after\nnature].\n\n\nBut, as he admits, mathematics too \u201cis higher than the science\nof nature since its subjects are abstracted from matters\u201d: so\nwhy doesn\u2019t it count as metaphysics? Aristotle in\nMetaphysics VI,1 says that mathematics falls short of being\nfirst philosophy because its objects, although unchanging, do not\nexist separately but rather are thought in abstraction from the things\nthey really exist in, whereas the objects of first philosophy are not\nmerely thought in abstraction but really exist\nseparately. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes this up, and, like all\nancient and medieval interpreters, takes \u201cabstraction\u201d and\n\u201cseparation\u201d to mean abstraction and separation from\nmatter. It makes sense to say that God exists really separated\nfrom matter and triangles don\u2019t. But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nthinks that the objects of metaphysics include not only God but also\nbeing and unity. Why should being and unity be any more\n\u201cseparate\u201d than triangles are? Here\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee reinterprets the notion of separation.\nSome of the objects of metaphysics, like God, \u201care\nthings that have no existence at all in natural things\u201d. But\nothers, like being and its universal attributes, \u201care things\nthat exist in natural things but are imagined as abstracted from\nthem\u201d, and are to that extent like mathematical objects; but,\nunlike mathematical objects, they\n\n\ndo not exist per se in these [natural] things in such a way\nthat their existence could not be divested from them: these are the\nthings whose subsistence is in natural things but which exist both in\nnatural things and in non-natural things.\n\n\nSo because being and its universal attributes are attributes of\nnatural things but are also attributes of separately existing\nimmaterial things, they too can be said to be \u201cseparate\u201d\nfrom natural things and from matter.\n\nRecall that in the Enumeration of the Sciences\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee describes metaphysics as investigating three\nthings\u2014being and its attributes, the principles of the\nparticular sciences, and separate incorporeal beings (especially\nGod)\u2014but he does not explain why the three investigations fall\nunder a single science or what premisses the science can draw on to\nresolve the questions. In On the Aims of the Metaphysics he\ntries to explain how these investigations fit together. The science\nstarts by studying its primary subject, namely being and unity; then,\n\u201csince the science of opposites is the same\u201d, their\nopposites, non-being and multiplicity; then it divides being and unity\nand their opposites into their main species, or rather\nquasi-species\u2014\u201cquasi\u201d because substances, qualities,\nand the other categories are each called \u201cbeing\u201d in a\ndifferent sense, whereas if being were a genus and they were its\nspecies it would be said of them all in the same\n sense.[12]\n Then the science investigates the attributes and principles of being\nand unity and their opposites,\n\n\nand these things are divided and subdivided until the subjects of the\nparticular sciences are reached, and this science terminates and there\nare manifested in it the principles of all the particular sciences and\nthe definitions of their subjects.\n\n\nBecause being and unity are not univocal, we cannot just\nstraightforwardly investigate their attributes and causes, but once\nthey have been analyzed into their different senses, we can\ninvestigate the attributes and causes of each sense of being or unity\nin the same way that any other science investigates the attributes and\ncauses of some given genus. A given effect, say substantial being, may\nhave different kinds of causes (for instance, both a formal cause and\na material cause), and these different kinds of causes may not all\nconverge on a first principle which is a cause in all these ways at\nonce (there will not be a single first principle that is both a formal\nand a material cause). Some chains of causes may proceed upwards\nad infinitum without reaching a first principle (like the\nchain of my ancestors, if the world and species within it are\neternal); and chains of causes of some kind may lead to many first\ncauses which have no further causes of that kind, rather than to a\nsingle first cause (each animal has a soul as a first formal cause\nwhich has no higher formal cause, but there will be as many such\nsouls, not a single soul which is a first formal cause of all\nanimals). Nonetheless, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee claims that there is a\nsingle first cause of all beings, which does not itself have a cause\nof any kind; if so, such a thing would deserve the name\n \u201cGod\u201d.[13]\n If the science can show that there is such a single first principle,\nthe science would then try to deduce what this principle must be like\nin order to be a cause of all beings, and in order not to have any\nfurther cause itself, and would then try to deduce how it must acts in\norder to cause the existence of other things, some directly and others\nindirectly. Here in On the Aims F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says\nthat Aristotle does all these things in Metaphysics XII:\n\n\nThe eleventh book [i.e., Book XII, Lambda] is about the principle of\nsubstance and [thereby] of all existence, the existence [of this\nprinciple] and the confirmation that it is knowing by its essence and\ntrue by its essence, and about the separate beings which are after it,\nand about how the existence of beings depends on it.\n\n\nBut that is all that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says here, and he never\ngives any more detailed discussion of how he thinks Aristotle does\nthis in Metaphysics XII. But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee himself\ntries to deliver on this promise in his Perfect City and\nPolitical Regime, which we will turn to after discussing his\nanalysis of being and unity and other equally universal concepts in\nhis Book of Letters and On the One and Unity.\n3. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s ontology: the Book of Letters and On the One and Unity\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s most widely-known and perhaps\nbest-understood work, the Principles of the Opinions of the People\nof the Perfect City, and his often similar Political\nRegime, presuppose analyses of being and unity in arguing for\nconclusions about God and his attributes and his causality; but\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee makes these analyses fully explicit only in\ntwo much less widely known and less well-understood texts, the\nKit\u00e2b al-\u1e25ur\u00fbf = Book of Letters\nand On the One and Unity, which are intended to be read\ntogether. Both of these texts were edited for the first time by Muhsin\nMahdi, the Book of Letters in 1969 and On the One and\nUnity in 1989; only partial translations of the Book of\nLetters, and no translations at all of On the One and\nUnity, have been published in English or any western European\n language.[14]\n Both texts are difficult, and at least the Book of Letters\npresents serious textual problems; there have been few studies of\nOn the One and Unity, and most studies of the Book of\nLetters have focussed on its socio-political rather than\nmetaphysical\n sections.[15]\n So what is said here must remain tentative.\n3.1 F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s project in the Book of Letters\n\nThe most basic questions about the Book of Letters are what,\nif anything, the treatise is about overall, and how the different\nparts of the treatise contribute to knowledge of that aim. Mahdi 1969a\ndivides the text into three \u201cParts\u201d\n[abw\u00e2b]; in the manuscripts that have been studied so\nfar, the three Parts are probably not transmitted in the right order,\nsome parts of the text and perhaps in particular an introduction are\nmissing, and it is not obvious what the subject-matters of the three\nParts have to do with each other. The title Kit\u00e2b\nal-\u1e25ur\u00fbf = Book of Letters is the same title\nby which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in On the Aims cites\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (which presumably gets called\nBook of Letters because Arabic authors cite its individual\nbooks by the names of letters of the alphabet, just as we do now), so\nthe title suggests that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee intends this treatise\nto correspond to the Metaphysics; and there are heavy\noverlaps of content between the Book of Letters and\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, especially but not exclusively\nBook V, which make it very unlikely that the correspondence of titles\nis a coincidence. But the title Kit\u00e2b\nal-\u1e24ur\u00fbf can also mean something else, since\n\u201c\u1e25ur\u00fbf\u201d (sg. \u1e25arf),\nbesides meaning \u201cletters\u201d, can also mean grammatical\n\u201cparticles\u201d, i.e., any words that can neither be declined\nlike a noun nor conjugated like a verb, so pronouns and articles and\nprepositions and adverbs and\n conjunctions.[16]\n Parts I and III of the Book of Letters are organized\n\u201clexically\u201d (like F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s On\nIntelligence), around the many meanings of each of a series of\nterms, and the majority of the terms here are grammatically particles\nrather than nouns or verbs: once again, it seems very unlikely that\nthis is a coincidence. But how can the same book be Kit\u00e2b\nal-\u1e24ur\u00fbf both in the sense of filling the role of\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, and in the sense of being\nabout grammatical particles? And how would a study of the meanings of\nparticles (and of some selected nouns) contribute to metaphysics as\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has described it in On the Aims? To\nsee how this could work, we have to see something about the projects\nof the three Parts of the Book of Letters and how they fit\ntogether; and we have to start with Part II, which\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee probably intended to come first, and which\ncan be taken as programmatic for the whole treatise. After discussing\nthe project of the treatise, we will focus on its most remarkable\nclaims about the different senses of being [mawj\u00fbd] and\nthe corresponding senses of existence [wuj\u00fbd], and\nabout how they should be investigated, and the implications for\nmetaphysics. Finally, we will look more briefly at the corresponding\nclaims about one and unity in On the One and Unity.\n\nPart II of the Book of Letters gives an account of the\ndevelopment of the \u201csyllogistic arts\u201d (arts of reasoning\nsuch as rhetoric, dialectic and sophistic), culminating in\ndemonstrative science, within a given linguistic and religious\ncommunity, and their transmission from one community to another.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is especially interested in the\nlanguage of these arts, especially of demonstrative science.\nHe talks about the origin of language as such; but language as it\nnaturally arises is not well suited to being the vehicle of\ndemonstrative science, because it is chiefly devoted to naming and\ndescribing the objects of immediate practical interest to human\nbeings, which are not the main objects of theoretical interest. But\nnatural language can be extended in two main ways to provide the\nterminology of the syllogistic arts. First, terms of ordinary language\ncan be extended metaphorically to new meanings, and can then be frozen\nfor use as technical terms; and this process of metaphorical extension\nand freezing can be repeated indefinitely many times. Second, new\nterms can be formed from old ones by regular grammatical processes of\nmorphological derivation, and this type of extension too can be\nrepeated and combined with the first type. Special problems, however,\narise when the arts, especially demonstrative science, are transmitted\nfrom one community to another, and the translators must create a new\ntechnical vocabulary in the target-language. If the technical terms of\nthe source-text were derived by freezing metaphorically extended words\nin the source-language, the translator may try to create new technical\nterms either by imitating the metaphors of the source-language in the\ntarget-language, where they may be much less natural, or else by\nforming new terms from metaphors more natural to the target language:\neither way, there is a risk of misunderstanding.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee talks about these problems in general, but he\ndevotes special attention to the transmission of demonstrative\nphilosophy and its vocabulary from Greek into (Syriac and thus)\nArabic.\n\nAlthough F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not make explicit connections\nbetween the different Parts of the Book of Letters, Part II\ncan be seen as giving an implicit program for Parts I and III, each of\nwhich is organized lexically around a list of terms: in each case\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee lists the different meanings of the term,\nstarting with an ordinary-language meaning and then explaining how it\nis metaphorically extended to a series of further meanings, including\ntechnical meanings in the different arts and especially in philosophy.\nPart I treats in this way terms including the names of many of the ten\nAristotelian categories, or the interrogative particles from which\nnames of categories are derived (\u201ckamiyya\u201d =\nquantity is derived from \u201ckam?\u201d = \u201chow\nmuch?\u201d, and so on); it also discusses particles such as\n\u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cbecause\u201d and nouns such as\n\u201cbeing\u201d, \u201cessence\u201d, and\n\u201caccident\u201d, with a heavy overlap with the list of terms\ninvestigated in Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics V. Part Three\napplies the same lexical method to the four kinds of scientific\nquestion or investigation described in Posterior Analytics\nII, the questions \u201cwhether X is\u201d, \u201cwhat\nX is\u201d, \u201cthat S is P\u201d, and\n\u201cwhy S is P\u201d. In each of these cases\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee distinguishes the ways of investigating these\nquestions in different disciplines\u2014for instance, how they are\ninvestigated in dialectic vs. how they are investigated in\ndemonstrative science\u2014as if they turned on different meanings\nthat the particles, \u201cwhether\u201d or \u201cwhat\u201d or\n\u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d, have in different syllogistic\narts. There are clear connections between Parts I and III, notably\nbetween Part I on the senses of \u201cbeing\u201d\n[mawj\u00fbd] and Part III on the senses of \u201cwhether\nit is\u201d [hal mawj\u00fbd]. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nevidently thinks that people have gone wrong in the sciences through\nconfusing different meanings of the terms he discusses, in particular\nthrough confusing ordinary-language meanings of these terms with\ntechnical meanings in the syllogistic arts, or confusing meanings in\none syllogistic art with meanings in another. And he thinks these\nproblems are made worse when the technical terms of these arts are\nfirst developed in one language (Greek) and then translated into\nanother (Arabic) in the ways he has described in Part II: if a word\nwhich has a meaning in ordinary Arabic (or in the technical vocabulary\nof some native Arabic art), or a word morphologically derived from\nsuch an Arabic word, has its meaning extended to serve as the\nartificial Arabic equivalent of some Greek technical term, then there\nis a serious risk that it will be misunderstood by Arabic readers.\nThis explains why F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that the sort of\nwork Aristotle does in Metaphysics V, distinguishing\ndifferent meanings of a series of technical terms, would be even more\nnecessary in Arabic than it was in Greek.\n3.2 Logical and grammatical form, and the role of particles\n\nSomething more, however, is needed to explain why\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee concentrates so heavily on the meanings of\nparticles, and why he thinks (as he does) that this study\nwill lead to a scientific investigation of being and its causes.\n\nA crucial point is that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is worried not just\nabout lexical confusions (confusions between two meanings of a term or\nbetween two similar terms), but about confusions arising from the\nmisleading grammatical form of a term: he thinks that these confusions\nhave given rise to serious philosophical errors, and he thinks that\nthe translation process has made such confusions more likely. Part I\nof the Book of Letters distinguishes between the primitive\nterms of a language and the terms derived or \u201cparonymous\u201d\n[mushtaqq] from them. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes the\nnotion of paronymy ultimately from Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories 1 (1a12\u201315). A proper noun like\n\u201cSocrates\u201d, a common noun like \u201chorse\u201d, and an\nabstract accidental term like \u201cwhiteness\u201d are all\nprimitive terms, but the concrete accidental term \u201cwhite\u201d\nis paronymous or derived from \u201cwhiteness\u201d, not necessarily\nin the sense that it arises later in the history of the language than\n\u201cwhiteness\u201d, but in the sense that something is called\n\u201cwhite\u201d (rather than \u201cwhiteness\u201d)\nbecause there is a whiteness in it. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee,\nunlike Aristotle, also treats (finite) verbs as being paronymous from\ntheir infinitives, where the infinitive [ma\u1e63dar] in\nArabic is a noun expressing the action of the verb. The grammatical\nform of a paronymous term suggests that something is X by\nhaving an X-ness present in it, or V\u2019s by\nhaving an action of V-ing in it. But sometimes the\ngrammatical form of a term misleadingly fails to track its logical\nform, and in these cases there is a risk of being deceived by what\nAristotle in On Sophistical Refutations calls sophisms of\nskh\u00eama t\u00eas lexe\u00f4s: this is usually\ntranslated into English as \u201csophisms of figure of speech\u201d,\nbut they would more accurately be called \u201csophisms of\ngrammatical form\u201d, i.e., sophisms which arise because the\ngrammatical form of an expression fails to correspond to its logical\nform, and which can be solved only by diagnosing this\n discrepancy.[17]\n The Arabic translators of Greek philosophical texts, in trying to\nfind Arabic equivalents for the Greek source-terms, often use such\nawkward and potentially misleading expressions, and so do Arabic\nphilosophical texts written in imitation of the language of the\ntranslations. In particular, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that the\nGreek word for \u201cbeing\u201d was non-paronymous, but that some\ntranslators, not finding a good non-paronymous Arabic equivalent,\ninstead used the paronymous word, \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d,\nliterally \u201cfound\u201d, and that this gave rise to the\ngrammatical appearance that something is existent or\n\u201cfound\u201d [mawj\u00fbd] through an existence or\n\u201cfinding\u201d [wuj\u00fbd] present in it, as\nsomething is white through a whiteness present in it.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, applying a methodological principle of\ncharity, seems to assume that in each case the Greek original was free\nof such infelicities: this means that, in practice, his reconstructed\nGreek serves as an ideal logical language, i.e., a language in which\ngrammatical form always tracks logical form.\n\nWhere grammatical form tracks logical form, a non-paronymous noun will\nsignify either a substance or a being in one of the nine Aristotelian\ncategories of accidents, and a paronymous noun or a verb will signify\nthat such a being is present in or attributed to some underlying\nsubject. But metaphysics, as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee understands it,\nis not about things in the categories (Book of Letters\nI,11\u201317), but rather about the categories themselves (especially\nsubstance) and about trans-categorial concepts such as being, unity,\nessence, cause, and also God (who also, for F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee,\ndoes not fall under any category). And where grammatical form tracks\nlogical form, these concepts will be signified neither by\nnon-paronymous nouns, nor by paronymous nouns or verbs, but by\nparticles. Particles in an ideal logical language thus correspond\nroughly to what a modern philosopher would call logical constants. And\nit is clear that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that at least some\nimportant metaphysical notions were expressed in Greek by particles,\nor by terms morphologically derived from\n particles.[18]\n As noted above, the names of many of the Aristotelian categories in\nArabic (and of some of them in Greek) either are particles or are\nmorphologically derived from particles, and the scientific questions\nfrom Posterior Analytics II, which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ntreats in Book of Letters Part III, are distinguished by\ntheir different interrogative words (\u201cif/whether\u201d,\n\u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwhy\u201d), which in Arabic are all\nparticles. And F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee may well have thought that the\nGreek original of Metaphysics V was devoted to distinguishing\nthe many meanings of particles (not just of words in\ngeneral), not in the sense that the lexical items that head each\nchapter of Metaphysics V are in all cases themselves\nparticles or even nouns morphologically derived from particles\n(although some of them\n are),[19]\n but in the sense that the many meanings of these nouns would track\nthe many meanings of some particle, as the meanings of the noun\n\u201ccause\u201d (Metaphysics V,2) track the meanings of\nthe particle \u201cbecause\u201d. There is in fact good reason to\nthink this is true for a reasonable number of the chapters of\nMetaphysics\n V.[20]\nMetaphysics V also discusses the categories of quantity and\nquality (V,13\u201314), where, as noted, the name of the category is\nderived from an interrogative word which is a particle in Arabic and\nwhich F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee might well expect to be a particle in\nGreek (although in fact it is not), and the category of substance\n(V,8), where it is reasonable to say that the many meanings of\n\u201csubstance\u201d track the many meanings of the question\n\u201cwhat it is\u201d from Posterior Analytics II and\nBook of Letters Part III, where again the interrogative word\n\u201cwhat\u201d (ti in Greek, m\u00e2 in Arabic)\nis a particle in Arabic. We can also reasonably say that the many\nmeanings of \u201cbeing\u201d (V,7, on in Greek,\nmawj\u00fbd in Arabic) track the many meanings of the\nquestion \u201cwhether it is\u201d from Posterior Analytics\nII and Book of Letters Part III (ei esti in Greek,\nhal mawj\u00fbd in Arabic), where the interrogative word\n\u201cwhether\u201d is a particle in both languages. More\nsurprisingly, although F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee cites the Greek word\nfor \u201cbeing\u201d as ast\u00een = estin,\nwhich is in fact the third-person singular present-tense verb\n\u201cis\u201d, he says explicitly that this word is not a verb and\nthat it is not a paronymous noun: his description of its functions\nimplies that it also cannot be a non-paronymous noun, and so for\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee this word must be a\n particle.[21]\n3.3 F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee on the word for being, in Greek and Arabic\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s analysis of the Greek word for being\nas a particle is important in his reconstruction of the syntax of\nGreek as something close to a logically ideal language, in his\nreconstruction of the underlying logical syntax of any language, and\nin his diagnosis of the misunderstandings that can arise when the\ngrammatical form of an expression in some natural language fails to\ntrack its underlying logical form, as when the paronymous Arabic word\nmawj\u00fbd = \u201cbeing\u201d suggests that being is an\naccident. While F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives what we can think of as\nan Arabic analogue to Aristotle\u2019s discussion in\nMetaphysics V,7 of the many meanings of \u201cbeing\u201d,\nthe Arabic analogue focusses on several features that the Greek\noriginal does not: the paronymous form of the word\nmawj\u00fbd, the difficulties that led the translators to\ndraft the word mawj\u00fbd, literally \u201cfound\u201d,\ninto service as an equivalent to the Greek word for being, and the\nrelation between mawj\u00fbd = \u201cbeing\u201d in the\nsense of \u201cthat which is\u201d, and wuj\u00fbd =\n\u201cexistence\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d in the sense of\n\u201cthe being of that which is\u201d. Furthermore, while the use\nof mawj\u00fbd in the syllogistic arts to mean\n\u201cbeing\u201d is always a metaphorical extension from the\noriginal meaning \u201cfound\u201d, and its use,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also thinks that mawj\u00fbd =\n\u201cbeing\u201d has different meanings in different\nsyllogistic arts, and in particular that it has a distinctive meaning\nin demonstrative science, contrasting with its meaning in dialectic,\nand that the paronymous form of the word, while it has some\njustification in dialectic, is more seriously misleading in\ndemonstrative science. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that bringing\nout the distinctive scientific meaning of \u201cbeing\u201d, and the\ndistinctive logical form of the word \u201cbeing\u201d as used in\ndemonstrative science, will show the path to a scientific treatment of\nbeing, based on distinctively scientific ways of investigating (for a\ngiven X) both the question whether X is and\nthe question what X is.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says:\n\n\nin all other languages [i.e., other than Arabic], such as Persian and\nSyriac and Sogdian, there is an expression which they use to signify\nall things without specifying one thing as opposed to another thing\n[i.e., it is a predicate which is true of any subject whatever], and\nthey also use it to signify the connection\n[rib\u00e2\u1e6d, elsewhere translated\n\u201ccopula\u201d] between the predicate and what it is predicated\nof: this is what connects the predicate with the subject when the\npredicate is a noun or when they want the predicate to be connected\nwith the subject absolutely, without any mention of time. (Book of\nLetters I,82, p.111,4\u20138)\n\n\nA brief summary is given below of F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nview on how being is expressed in Greek and Arabic, and of the\ndifficulties faced by the Arabic translators, but for a fuller\ndiscussion see\n Supplement: F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee on the word for being, in Greek and Arabic\n\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee assumes that Greek (like Arabic)\ndistinguishes syntactically between tensed and tenseless sentences,\nand that (unlike Arabic) it expresses the copula in both kinds of\nsentences. Because, according to Aristotle\u2019s definition of\n\u201cverb\u201d in On Interpretation 3, a verb must\n\u201cconsignify a time\u201d, the tenseless copula cannot be a\nverb. Nor can it be a noun: if to predicate one noun of another we\nmust insert a third noun between them, there will be an infinite\nregress of copulas. So the tenseless copula estin (or\nast\u00een), in Greek as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nreconstructs it, must be a particle, although there will also be\ntensed copulas which are verbs paronymously derived from this\nparticle. He also thinks that the same particle can function, not only\nin 2-place contexts, i.e., in tenseless predicative statements\n\u201cX is Y\u201d, but also in 1-place contexts,\ni.e., in tenseless statements of existence \u201cX\nis\u201d: and he assumes that this is the word that Aristotle is\ndiscussing in the chapter on the meanings of being,\nMetaphysics V,7.\n\nWe have seen that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that all languages\nother than Arabic have a word with these functions. Since\nArabic has no word that does all these things, he thinks that the\nArabic translators of Greek philosophical texts have had trouble with\nthis word, and he discusses different strategies that they have\nadopted. The most common strategy is to use the Arabic passive\nparticiple \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d, literally\n\u201cfound\u201d, as a tenseless \u201cis\u201d in both 1-place\nor 2-place contexts, and to use passive forms of the verb\n\u201cwajada\u201d, \u201cfind\u201d, for the tensed\n\u201cis\u201d and \u201cwas\u201d and \u201cwill be\u201d. The\ndisadvantage of \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d is that then the\nArabic word for \u201cis\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d, unlike the\nGreek word it translates, is grammatically paronymous, so that its\ngrammatical form does not correspond to its logical form:\n\nthe expression \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d is, in its first\nimposition in Arabic, paronymous, and every paronymous term by its\nconstruction gives the impression that there is in what it signifies\nan implicit subject and, in this subject, the meaning\n[ma\u201bn\u00e2] of the ma\u1e63dar [the\ninfinitive, functioning in Arabic as an abstract noun] from which [the\nterm] was derived [i.e., as \u201cwhite\u201d implies, without\nexplicitly mentioning, a subject in which whiteness is present]. For\nthis reason the expression \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d has\ngiven the impression that there is in every thing a meaning/entity\n[ma\u201bn\u00e2] in an implicit subject, and that this\nmeaning/entity is what is signified by the expression\n\u201cwuj\u00fbd\u201d [\u201cfinding\u201d or\n\u201cbeing found\u201d]: so it gave the impression that\nwuj\u00fbd is in an implicit subject, and\nwuj\u00fbd was understood as being like an accident in a\nsubject. (Book of Letters I,84, p.113,9\u201314)\n\nThere is thus a grammatical appearance that X exists or is a\nbeing (\u201cX mawj\u00fbd\u201d) through an\naccident of existence or beingness which inheres in X, or an\nact of finding X; and F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that\nthis appearance gives rise to serious metaphysical errors. His account\nof the logical syntax of being in the Book of Letters is\ndesigned to expose and root out these errors. In particular, it will\nfunction as a critique of anyone who wants to understand God as\nsomething like a Platonic form of being, so that other things would\nexist by participating in this form. (Averroes, later, will adapt\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s account of the logical syntax of\nbeing to give a criticism of Avicenna\u2019s distinction between\nessence and existence, see Menn 2011.) But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nalso wants to give the ontological foundations for a positive\nmetaphysical account of God, which he thinks Aristotle was aiming at\nin Metaphysics XII and which he will try to reconstruct in\nhis Principles of the Opinions of the People of the Perfect\nCity and his Political Regime (see\n Section 4\n below).\n3.4 F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee on the senses of being [mawj\u00fbd] and the corresponding senses of existence [wuj\u00fbd]\n\nWe might expect F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee to say that the paronymous\nform of the Arabic word for being or \u201cexists\u201d\n[mawj\u00fbd] is a mere grammatical accident and that there\nis no such thing as the existence [wuj\u00fbd] through which\nthings exist. Instead he distinguishes (at least) two senses of being\n[mawj\u00fbd], each applicable in both 1- and 2-place\ncontexts, and says that in each case there is a corresponding sense of\nexistence [wuj\u00fbd]. But he thinks that only a conflation\nbetween these two senses of being would lead us to believe that a\nbeing X exists through an existence which is both independent\nof the mind and extrinsic to the essence of X.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee tries to connect these two main senses of\nbeing with differences in how the term \u201cbeing\u201d is\nunderstood in different disciplines, specifically in dialectic and\ndemonstrative science, and with differences in how dialectic and\ndemonstrative science investigate the questions whether X is\nand what X is, which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee discusses in\nBook of Letters III in connection with the particles\n\u201cwhether\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d. His discussion is\ncomplicated and difficult, but some of his main points seem to be as\nfollows.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in Book of Letters I,88\u201394\ndescribes the different senses of being [mawj\u00fbd] and\nthe corresponding senses of existence [wuj\u00fbd],\nconcentrating on 1-place\n contexts.[22]\n Aristotle in Metaphysics V,7 distinguishes four main senses\nof being (giving mostly 2-place examples), in some cases with\nsub-senses: being per accidens, being per se (with\nsubsenses corresponding to the different categories), being as the\ntrue, and being in actuality or potentiality. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nhas nothing in I,88\u201394 corresponding to being per\n accidens,[23]\n and his treatment of the other main senses of being corresponds only\nroughly to Aristotle\u2019s\u2014of course, his treatment is longer\nand more detailed, and includes the discussion of existence\n[wuj\u00fbd], which does not correspond to anything in\nMetaphysics V,7. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee starts in I,88 by\ndistinguishing three main senses of being, namely the sense of being\nwhich is divided into different senses for the different categories\n(pp.115,15\u2013116,3), being as the true, i.e., what \u201cis\noutside the soul and is in itself [bi-\u201baynihi] as it is\nin the soul\u201d (p.116,3\u20136), and being as what is\n\u201ccircumscribed [mun\u1e25\u00e2z] by some quiddity\noutside the soul, whether it has been represented in the soul or has\nnot been represented\u201d (p.116,6\u20137). But in I,90 he says\nthat these three senses of being can be reduced to two, \u201cthat it\nis true and that it has some quiddity outside the soul\u201d\n(p.117,18\u201319). In this discussion F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is\ngiving his interpretation of two of Aristotle\u2019s four senses of\nbeing, being per se and being as the true. (Later, in\nI,93\u201394, he discusses being in actuality and potentiality, but\nonly as a subdivision within being as what has a quiddity outside the\nsoul, and it does not seem to play a large role in the Book of\nLetters.) In I,89, starting from the I,88 enumeration of three\nmain senses of being, he discusses what kind of existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] corresponds to each of these senses of being\n[mawj\u00fbd]; and in I,92 he tries to show that being as\nwhat has a quiddity outside the soul (unlike being as the true) is\nsaid not univocally, but of some things in more primary senses and of\nother things in derivative senses, across different categories and\neven within the category of substance.\n\nClearly the foundation of F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s account of\nbeing is his distinction between being as the true and being as what\nis circumscribed by a quiddity outside the soul. It is not immediately\nobvious what he means by this distinction, and there is no obvious\nprecedent, either in Greek or in Arabic, for his notion of\n\u201ccircumscription\u201d. At first blush, \u201cbeing outside\nthe soul and in itself as it is in the soul\u201d and \u201cbeing\ncircumscribed by some quiddity outside the soul\u201d (or\n\u201chaving some quiddity outside the soul\u201d) sound similar,\nalthough it is clear that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee wants them to be\nvery different. We might guess that the main difference is something\ncan have a quiddity outside the soul even if it is not represented in\nthe soul (as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee notes p.116,7); and in this\nsense F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that \u201cwhatever is true is\nalso circumscribed by some quiddity outside the soul\u201d (I,91\np.117,20). But the deeper difference is that while \u201cbeing\ncircumscribed by some quiddity outside the soul\u201d is predicated\nof an external object, being in the sense of \u201ctrue\u201d, i.e.,\n\u201cbeing outside the soul as it is in the soul\u201d, is\npredicated of something in the soul, and asserts that what is in the\nsoul has something outside the soul corresponding to it. So in I,89,\nin discussing the kinds of existence [wuj\u00fbd]\ncorresponding to each sense of \u201cbeing\u201d\n[mawj\u00fbd], F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that \u201cthe\nexistence [wuj\u00fbd] of what is true is a certain relation\nwhich\n thoughts[24]\n have to something outside the soul\u201d (p.117,4\u20135).\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is explicit that being in the sense of\n\u201ctrue\u201d applies not only to the soul\u2019s judgments but\nalso to its concepts (I,88 p.116,3\u20135): to say of a concept that\nit \u201cis\u201d in the sense of \u201cis true\u201d is to say\nthat it is instantiated. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is apparently the\nfirst person to have said that existence, in one sense of existence,\nis a second-order predicate or second-order concept, a concept that is\npredicated only of concepts; but, unlike Frege, he understands\nconcepts psychologistically, as mental\n states.[25]\n\nDespite F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s saying in I,91 (cited just\nabove) that being-as-having-a-quiddity-outside-the-soul is more widely\nextended than being-as-true, it emerges from his later discussions\nthat, taking \u201cquiddity outside the soul\u201d in a strict\nsense, having a quiddity outside the soul is more demanding,\nand that we must first ask whether something is in the sense\nof true, i.e., whether a given concept is instantiated outside the\nsoul, and only then, if the answer is yes, ask whether what\ninstantiates it is also circumscribed by a quiddity outside the soul.\nIf a concept is not instantiated outside the soul, such as (for\nAristotle and F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee) the concept of vacuum, then,\nwhile there vacuum has a quiddity-in-an-extended sense, since we can\nask \u201cwhat is vacuum?\u201d and answer the question by giving an\nexplanation of the name \u201cvacuum\u201d, a so-called\n\u201cnominal definition\u201d which identifies what concept the\nword \u201cvacuum\u201d stands for, nonetheless vacuum has no\nquiddity in the proper sense, and certainly no quiddity outside the\nsoul (I,91 p.118,4\u20139). Even after we have determined \u201cthat\nwhat is understood by the expression is the same outside the\nsoul\u201d, we can still ask \u201cdoes it exist [hal\nmawj\u00fbd] or not?\u201d, meaning now not \u201cis it\ntrue?\u201d but rather \u201cdoes it have some thing by which its\nconstitution [qiw\u00e2m] [is] and which is present in\nit\u201d (III,229\n p.214,4\u20139).[26]\n This will be \u201cone of the causes of its existence\u201d, so\nthat \u201cour saying \u2018does the thing exist?\u2019 in the\nsecond way\u201d is equivalent to \u201cdoes it have a cause by\nwhich its constitution [is] in its essence?\u201d (III,229\np.214,11\u201313). For\n\n\nnot everything which is understood by some expression, such that what\nis understood by it is also outside the soul, is such that it also has\nan essence: like the meaning of \u201cprivation\u201d, for it is a\nmeaning which is understood, and it is outside the soul as it is\nunderstood, but it is not an essence and does not have an essence.\n(III,240 p.218,12\u201315)\n\n\nExamples of concepts which are instantiated, but whose instantiations\nare not circumscribed by a quiddity, might include on the one hand\nnegations like not-a-horse or privations like blindness, and on the\nother hand beings per accidens, i.e., accidental combinations\nlike white horse. Each of these will have a nominal definition which\nidentifies what concept the name stands for, but it will not have a\nreal definition expressing a real quiddity, \u201cthe thing by which\nits constitution [is] and which is in it\u201d: things can be\nnot-horses or blind through many different positive causes, and a\nwhite horse will have a cause of being white and a cause of being a\nhorse, but no one cause that constitutes it as a white horse.\n\nIn Book of Letters I,88\u201390 F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ndescribes not only the different senses of \u201cbeing\n[mawj\u00fbd]\u201d, but also the corresponding senses of\n\u201cexistence [wuj\u00fbd]\u201d, i.e., that through\nwhich a mawj\u00fbd in each sense is mawj\u00fbd.\nAs we have already seen, \u201cthe existence [wuj\u00fbd]\nof what is true is a certain relation which thoughts have to something\noutside the soul\u201d (p.117,4\u20135). The existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] of something which is a being\n[mawj\u00fbd] in the sense in which being is divided into\nthe categories will just be the category under which that thing falls,\nwhich licenses calling it a being. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\ntreatment of the existence [wuj\u00fbd] of something which\nis a being [mawj\u00fbd] in the sense of being circumscribed\nby some quiddity outside the soul depends on whether it is a complex\n(divisible) or a simple (indivisible) quiddity.\n\n\nAs for that whose quiddity is divisible, three [kinds of] things are\nsaid to be its quiddity: (i) its unarticulated whole, (ii) [its whole]\narticulated by the parts by which its constitution [is], (iii) each of\nthe parts of the whole, each of them through [?] the whole in turn.\nIts whole is what its name signifies, and what is articulated by its\nparts is what its definition signifies, and each of its parts is genus\nand differentia, each in turn, or matter and form, each in turn. (I,88\np.116,8\u201313)\n\n\nThe existence [wuj\u00fbd] of a being\n[mawj\u00fbd] circumscribed by a complex quiddity, but not\nof a being circumscribed by a simple quiddity, can therefore be\ndistinguished from the being itself:\n\n\nin the case of what is divided so that it has a whole and the\narticulated [result] of this whole, the being [mawj\u00fbd]\nand the existence [wuj\u00fbd] are different: the being is\n[the thing] as a whole (this is the possessor of the quiddity) and the\nexistence is the quiddity of this thing, either articulated or each of\nthe parts of the whole, either its genus or its differentia, and since\nits differentia is more proper to it, [the differentia] is more\nappropriately called the existence which is proper to it. (I,89\np.117,1\u20134)\n\n\n(F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee adds that since the existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] of something which is a being in the sense of\nfalling under a category is the category or highest genus under which\nit falls, this will also be its existence as a part of its quiddity,\nso that being in the sense of falling under a category reduces to\nbeing in the sense of having a quiddity, and the initial three senses\nof being reduce to two, I,89 p.117,5\u20138 and I,90\np.117,14\u201319.) By contrast, \u201ceverything whose quiddity is\nindivisible either is a being which does not exist [yak\u00fbna\nmawj\u00fbdan l\u00e2 y\u00fbjadu]\u201d\u2014because the\nfinite verb \u201cexists\u201d is paronymous and would imply that\nexistence belongs to it as an accident\u2014\u201cor else the\nmeaning of its existence and that it exists [ma\u02bfna\nwuj\u00fbdihi wa-annahu mawj\u00fbdun] are one and the same,\nand that it is an existence [wuj\u00fbd] and that it is a\nbeing [mawj\u00fbd] are one and the same meaning\u201d,\nsince its existence [wuj\u00fbd] is not a further entity\nexplaining the fact that it is a being [mawj\u00fbd], but is\njust that being, which is simple and not explained by any further\ncause to explain it (I,89 p.117,8\u201310). This will be true both of\neach of the categories or highest genera (each category is an\nundefinable highest genus, and not a composite of being as a genus and\nsome differentia added to being), and of \u201cwhatever is not in a\nsubject and is not a subject of anything at all, for it is forever\nsimple in its quiddity\u201d (I,89\n p.117,10\u201313).[27]\n\nIn all of this F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is broadly following the\nAristotelian idea that, for any composite object X, we can\nask \u201cwhat is X?\u201d and answer the question either\nby giving a definition of X spelling X out into many\nin-some-sense-constituents of X, or by giving some one such\nconstituent of X, which is a partial answer to\n\u201cwhat is\n X?\u201d.[28]\n F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is also following Aristotle in insisting\nthat all of the things which should be mentioned in the definition of\nX are causes of X\u2019s being (\u201cthe thing by\nwhich [X\u2019s] constitution [is]\u201d), and,\nfurthermore, essential causes, in the sense that it is not simply that\nsome instance of X happens for this reason, but that a thing\nwouldn\u2019t be X if it weren\u2019t caused in this way:\naccording to Aristotle in Metaphysics VIII,4, a scientific\ndefinition of X should mention all and only such causes of\nX. He is also following Aristotle in saying that this process\nmust come to a stop with simples, where there will be no further\ndefinition and no distinction between the thing and any further answer\nto \u201cwhat is it?\u201d. He also follows Aristotle further down,\nin Book of Letters III,244, in saying that in asking for the\ncause of X\u2019s being, we cannot look for a middle term\nbetween the subject and predicate of \u201cX is [X\nmawj\u00fbd]\u201d, or between the subject and predicate of\n\u201cX is X\u201d. Rather, we must unpack this\njudgment so that its subject and predicate are different, so that we\ncan seek a middle term connecting them (\u201cwhy are there\neclipses?\u201d might be unpacked as \u201cwhy is the moon\neclipsed?\u201d or \u201cwhy is the moon darkened at\nopposition?\u201d): if X is simple, so that\n\u201cX is\u201d cannot be unpacked into a judgment with\ndistinct subject and predicate, then there is no further investigation\ninto why X is, and therefore also not into what X\n is.[29]\n But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is putting all of this in the service of\nan argument which has no direct parallel in Aristotle, that, contrary\nto the linguistic appearance of the paronymous term\nmawj\u00fbd (being or existent), a thing does not exist\nthrough an accident of existence [wuj\u00fbd] as it is white\nthrough an accident of whiteness (so I,84, p.113,9\u201314, cited\nabove). If we say that X exists [mawj\u00fbd] in\nthe sense that X is true, then the existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] of X is not an attribute of the real\nthing X outside the mind, but only an attribute of the mental\nconcept of X, namely, that that concept is instantiated\noutside the mind. If we say that X exists\n[mawj\u00fbd] in the sense that X is circumscribed\nby a real quiddity, then the existence [wuj\u00fbd] of\nX is that quiddity: either it is the whole essence of\nX as spelled out by its definition, or it is some part of the\nessence of X, or if X is simple it is just\nX itself, but in no case is it an accident of X.\n(F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also says similar things about two-places\nuses of mawj\u00fbd as a tenseless copula \u201cX\nis Y\u201d: particularly in I,101 he argues that\n\u201cX is Y\u201d has a sense which does not\nassert, e.g., that the quiddity of X is to be Y, or\nthat either X or Y have real quiddities outside the\nmind. What it asserts is something like two-place being-as-truth, but\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that such a sentence need not assert\nthat something is outside the mind as it is in the mind,\nsince in some \u201cX is Y\u201d is true although\nneither X nor Y exists outside the mind.)\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s distinction between being-as-true and\nbeing-as-having-a-quiddity-outside-the-mind also allows him to resolve\nthe issue about whether being is univocal or whether it is said of one\nthing (or of one kind of thing) primarily and of other things in a\ndependent and derivative sense. Looking only at one-place cases,\nbeing-as-true must be univocal to beings in all categories, and also\nto beings in no category such as negations or privations and beings\nper accidens like white horse. For I must be able to ask\n\u201cis the concept of X instantiated?\u201d before I know\nwhat category the instances of X will fall under, or even\nwhether X will turn out to be merely a privation, or an\naccidental combination of two positive entities. (If X is\neclipse, we might reasonably start by keeping many of these options\nopen: only the investigation of actual eclipses, if it turns out that\nthere are some, will determine which option is right.) By contrast,\n\u201cwhat has a quiddity outside the soul, although [being in this\nsense] is general, is said by priority and posteriority in\norder\u201d (I,92 p.118,14\u201316), since if the quiddity of\nX involves a reference to Y as the cause of\nexistence to X, then Y has a prior and stronger\nclaim than X to have a quiddity outside the soul, rendering\nit capable of independent existence. First, substances will be prior\nin this way to accidents, since for an accident to be is for it to\nbelong to a substance, and the scientific definition of any kind of\naccident will mention the kind of substance that it can be predicated\nof. But then, within the category of substance, \u201cwhat requires a\ndifferentia or genus in this category in order for its quiddity to be\nrealized is more deficient with respect to quiddity than the thing in\nthis category which is a cause of the realization of its\nquiddity\u201d, and by pursuing causes of quiddities in this way we\ncan come to some first substance, \u201cwhether this is one or more\nthan one\u201d, which has a stronger claim to the title of\n\u201cbeing\u201d than all other substances, and a fortiori\nthan accidents (I,92 pp.118,18\u2013119,4).\n\n\nAnd if something is discovered outside all these categories which is\nthe\n cause[30]\n of the realization of the quiddity of the most\n fundamental[31]\n thing in this category [i.e., the category of substance], then this\n*is more deserving to be called \u201cbeing\u201d\n[mawj\u00fbd] than the most perfect thing in this category,\nand this is the first cause of existence [wuj\u00fbd] to the\nmost perfect thing in this category, and this most perfect thing [sc.\nwithin the category of substance] is the cause in the quiddity\n of*[32]\n the other things in this category, and what is in this category is\nthe cause in the quiddity of the other categories: thus the beings,\nwhere what is meant by \u201cbeing\u201d is what has a quiddity\noutside the soul, are ordered by this order. (I,92\np.119,4\u20138)\n\n\nIt was traditional enough to say that God (and only God) is being in\nthe strictest sense, and is the cause of existence to all other\nbeings. But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s version is importantly\ndifferent. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is taking up Aristotle\u2019s\nprogram of defining each thing through its essential cause, and\narguing that this kind of cause of X\u2019s existing (such\nthat something would not be an X if it were caused in some\nother way) is the existence [wuj\u00fbd] of\nX and has a stronger claim to the title of being\n[mawj\u00fbd] than X: if this causal chain leads\nultimately to God, so that God is ultimately involved in the quiddity\nof each other thing, then F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee will have a\nscientific Aristotelian way of filling in the program of the Aims\nof the Metaphysics, of showing how an analysis of being and of\nits causes (once we grasp the relevant senses of being and of cause)\nwill lead to God as the first cause of being and universal first\nprinciple. As this is presented in the Book of Letters, it is\njust a program for research, which might or might not lead up to a\nsingle first cause of existence from which all other beings can be\nderived carried out. But in the Perfect City and the\nPolitical Regime F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives at least a\nsketch of the upward causal argument to God as a single first cause of\nexistence, and of the downward path from God to all other beings.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee sees a charter for this causal investigation\nof the existence of thing especially in Aristotle\u2019s\nPosterior Analytics II.\n3.5 F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee on the scientific questions about being\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee further develops the discussion of the\nrelation between a being and its existence, in different senses of\n\u201cexistence\u201d, in Book of Letters III. Here he is\nofficially continuing the discussion of particles by explaining the\nmeanings of various interrogative particles in different\n\u201csyllogistic arts\u201d: the main interest is to explain the\ndistinctive meanings these particles have in demonstrative science,\nand to warn against confusing them with the meanings they have in\nother disciplines. This resembles the discussion in Book of\nLetters I, but the particles (and \u201clogical\u201d particles\nwhich are grammatically nouns in Arabic) discussed in Book of\nLetters I correspond roughly to those discussed in\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics V; Book of Letters\nIII, by contrast, picks up issues from Posterior Analytics\nII. There Aristotle discusses the different kinds of scientific\n\u201cquestion\u201d or \u201cinvestigation\u201d\n[z\u00eat\u00easis], and he specifies each one by an\ninterrogative particle (\u201cwhether\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d,\n\u201cwhy\u201d). But Aristotle is interested mainly in the methods\nthe scientist uses to answer these questions; nobody before\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee had thought there was a distinctive\nscientific meaning of the particles themselves. But Aristotle does\ntalk about how the scientist should investigate whether something is,\nwhat something is, and why something is, and F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ntakes this discussion as giving not just a methodology but a\nscientific account of existence and quiddity, i.e., of the scientific\nmeanings of the particles \u201cwhether\u201d and\n\u201cwhat\u201d.\n\nAristotle discusses there four types of scientific question or\ninvestigation, \u201cwhether X is\u201d, \u201cwhat\nX is\u201d, \u201cwhether X is Y\u201d,\nand \u201cwhy X is Y\u201d. His main claim is that\nthe investigation what X is stands to the\ninvestigation whether X is, as the investigation\nwhy X is Y stands to the investigation\nwhether X is Y. So in order to determine\nwhat X is, we must first investigate\nwhether X is, and then, if the answer is yes,\ninvestigate why X is. An answer to why\nX is can be converted into a scientific answer to\nwhat X is; where to discover why X\nis, we must reformulate the judgment \u201cX is\u201d as a\ntwo-place judgment with distinct subject and predicate terms, and then\nlook for a middle term connecting them. In the standard example, if\nX is (lunar) eclipse, before we can scientifically\ninvestigate what eclipses are, we must first investigate whether there\nare eclipses; if there are, and if the nominal definition of (lunar)\neclipse is \u201cdarkening of the moon at opposition\u201d, then we\ninvestigate why the moon is sometimes darkened at opposition; and if\nwe conclude that this is due to the interposition of the earth between\nthe moon and the sun, we can convert this into a scientific definition\nof eclipse as \u201cdarkening of the moon at opposition due to the\ninterposition of the earth between the sun and the moon\u201d.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes all this up in Book of Letters\nIII,226 and following, under the headings of the scientific meanings\nof the particles \u201cwhether\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, and\n\u201cwhy\u201d: or rather, when he says \u201cwhether X\nexists\u201d (or \u201cdoes X exist?\u201d, hal\nX mawj\u00fbdun), both the word\n\u201cwhether\u201d and the word \u201cexists\u201d are logically,\nif not grammatically, particles. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee follows\nAristotle in saying that there is an ordered series of questions or\ninvestigations: first we must ask whether X exists,\nand only then, if the answer is yes, can we ask what\nX is, by asking why X exists. But\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s story is more complicated than\nAristotle\u2019s, because he distinguishes different senses both of\n\u201cwhether X exists\u201d and of \u201cwhat X\nis\u201d. Fundamentally, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that there\nis a series of four questions: first \u201cwhat X is\u201d\nseeking the nominal definition of X, which spells out the\nconcept of X in the soul; then \u201cwhether X\nis\u201d in the sense of being-as-the-true, asking whether X\nexists outside the soul as it does in the soul; then \u201cwhether\nX is\u201d in the sense of being as having a quiddity\noutside the soul, asking rather \u201cdoes it have some thing by\nwhich its constitution [qiw\u00e2m] [is] and which is\npresent in it\u201d (III,229 p.214,6\u20137, cited above); then\n\u201cwhat X is\u201d seeking the quiddity of X\noutside the soul, namely this thing present in X which is the\ncause of X\u2019s constitution. The Posterior\nAnalytics has nothing corresponding to the distinction between\nthe two \u201cwhether X is\u201d questions, but\nPosterior Analytics II,2 does say that when we\nask/investigate whether X is Y, or whether\nX is, we are asking \u201cwhether there is a middle\nterm for it\u201d, and that when we then ask/investigate why\nX is Y, or what X is, we are\nasking \u201cwhat that middle term is\u201d (89b37\u201390a1). And\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee argues that this requires a distinctive\nmeaning of \u201cis\u201d in the question \u201cwhether X\nis\u201d, since X could exist in the sense that it is\noutside the soul as it is in the soul, without there being a middle\nterm between some subject and some predicate which would cause\nX\u2019s existence. There are at least two ways this could\nhappen. First, if X is a privation or even\n\u201cprivation\u201d in general (see III,240 p.218,12\u201315,\nquoted above), or presumably also if X is an ens per\naccidens like white horse, there simply is nothing outside the\nmind by which X is constituted. Second, if X has/is\na simple quiddity, then \u201cX is\u201d cannot be\nexpanded into a sentence \u201cY is Z\u201d where\nthere might be a middle term between the subject and the predicate. So\nonce we have established that X exists outside the soul, we\nmust still investigate whether X is constituted by some cause\noutside the soul, and then what that cause is.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee takes this result as indicating that\ndialectic and demonstrative science give different meanings, not only\nto the \u201cwhat is X?\u201d question and thus to quiddity\n(dialectic seeking a nominal definition, science a causal definition),\nbut also to the \u201cwhether X is\u201d question and thus\nto existence. So he says that, as in dialectic the two-place\ninvestigation \u201cwhether X is Y\u201d is only\nconcerned with the copula (not with whether it is essential\npredication), so in dialectic the one-place investigation\n\u201cwhether X is\u201d is asking only about being as the\ntrue, i.e., about whether the concept of X is instantiated\n(III,246\u20137). He connects this with an inherited problem in\nAristotle\u2019s dialectic: in the Topics Aristotle\nclassifies dialectical problems as asking whether Y is an\naccident of X, whether Y is the genus of X,\nwhether Y is proper to X, or whether Y is\nthe definition of X\u2014so how should we treat the question\nwhether X exists? As F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, Alexander\nof Aphrodisias in his commentary on the Topics classifies\nquestions of existence as questions of accident, treating the\nexistence of X as an accident of X. And\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that he is right to do so, since\ndialectic is asking whether the concept of X in the mind is\ninstantiated outside the mind, and this belongs as an accident to the\nconcept of X. However, if we mean whether the real thing\nX outside the mind is constituted by some quiddity, or\nwhether X falls under one of the categories, then we would be\nasking whether something belongs to X as its genus or\ndefinition. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also says that different\nparticular sciences give different meanings to these questions.\nNotably, in physics the questions \u201cwhether X is\u201d\nand \u201cwhat X is\u201d are asking for any kind\nof cause of X\u2019s existing, whether that cause is\ninternal to X or not (III,237)\u2014it could be an extrinsic\nefficient or final cause, like the earth blocking sunlight from\nreaching the moon, which would be incorporated into a physical\ndefinition, as in this case of eclipse. Most importantly, in\n\u201cthe divine science\u201d, if we ask whether God is,\nand if we mean by this whether there is some cause through which God\nis\n constituted,[33]\n then while this is a legitimate question the answer can only be no\n(III,238\u20139 and III,243). Nonetheless, we can still ask of God\n\u201cwhether he is some circumscribed essence\u201d (III,240,\np.218,11), and we can discover that he is, not because we can give a\ndefinition analyzing that essence into simpler terms, but because in\nanalyzing other beings and seeking their causal definitions, tracing\nthem back step by step to their causes, we discover that they all lead\nultimately to a single first cause of their existence, so that God\nenters into the fully spelled out quiddities of everything else\n(III,251). Because we learn in this way that God is simple and\ndependent on no cause, we can ask \u201cwhether his existence is an\nexistence which, in order for him to exist through it, needs nothing\nother than itself in any way\u201d (III,242 p.220,1\u20132), neither\na substratum nor an efficient cause, and the answer is yes. So too in\nthe divine science, if we ask \u201cwhether God is X\u201d\nfor some predicate X (whether God is an intelligence, is\nknowing, is one, is a maker or cause of something else\u2019s\nexisting, III,242 p.220,2\u20135), and if we mean by that\n\u201cwhether there is a middle term for it\u201d as Posterior\nAnalytics II,2 suggests, i.e., a cause to God of his being\nX, such as an accident inhering in God, or a part of\nGod\u2019s essence distinct from the whole essence, then again the\nanswer can only be no. But we can also mean\n\n\nwhether the existence by which his constitution is not by anything\nother than he, is that he is intelligence and knowing, and whether his\nessence is that he is intelligence,\n\n\nand in asking whether he is the cause or agent of something\nelse\u2019s existing we can mean\n\n\nwhether his existence by which he is existent, or his quiddity which\nspecifies him, or which belongs to him, necessitates that he is a\ncause of the existence of something other than he, or the maker of\nsomething other than he. (III,242 p.220,3\u20136)\n\n\nAnd again we discover, by tracing back the causes of things to a first\ncause which needs nothing beyond itself to know and to produce, that\nthe answer is yes. This text is a charter for the theological parts of\nthe Perfect City and Political Regime, discussed in\n Section 4\n below.\n3.6 On the One and Unity: senses of unity, different relations between one and many, and the circumscription of a thing by its quiddity\n\nTo F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s \u201cgeneral\nmetaphysics\u201d\u2014his study of being and its universal\nattributes, rather than of God as the first cause of\nbeing\u2014belongs not only the Book of Letters but also\nOn the One and Unity. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in On the\nAims of the Metaphysics had included unity alongside being in the\nobject of metaphysics; and when Book of Letters I follows the\nagenda and many of the subject-headings of Aristotle\u2019s\n\u201clexicon\u201d in Metaphysics V, it is strange that it\nleaves out unity, which Aristotle treats in Metaphysics V,6.\nBut the treatment of unity, missing from the Book of Letters,\nis supplied by On the One and Unity [henceforth On the\nOne]. Since the Book of Letters as is incompletely\ntransmitted, it is not entirely out of the question that On the\nOne is a missing part of the Book of Letters. Perhaps\nmore likely, On the One was originally intended as a part of\nthe Book of Letters, but got too long and complicated, and\nwas spun off as a separate treatise. The treatise is too complicated\nand too little-studied (with major editorial problems) to treat here\nin full detail, but we can describe some major themes. The treatise is\nhelpful in understanding the notion of circumscription by a quiddity,\nwhich is thematized both in the Book of Letters and On\nthe One and used without explanation in the Perfect City\nand Political Regime, and also in understanding\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s explanation of Aristotle\u2019s\nclaim in Metaphysics IV,2 that being and unity are\ncoextensive and mutually entailing, and his account in the Perfect\nCity and Political Regime of how unity is predicated of\nGod.\n\nMain themes of the treatise include distinguishing a whole family of\nsenses of \u201cone\u201d (in a few cases F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nalso gives the corresponding senses of the abstract\n\u201cunity\u201d), but also and especially distinguishing different\nways that senses of \u201cone\u201d are related to senses of\n\u201cmany\u201d. The treatise can read like a dry catalogue, and\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee rarely gives arguments or admits that his\nclaims might be controversial, but it is often clear that he has an\nopponent in mind. That opponent might be a type rather than a\nparticular earlier philosopher, but it seems likely that it is\nspecifically al-Kind\u00ee. Kind\u00ee had argued in On First\nPhilosophy that any thing other than God that is called\n\u201cone\u201d is many as well as one, and therefore that it is one\nnot essentially but only accidentally, indeed that it is one only\nimproperly or \u201cmetaphorically\u201d; and he argues that such a\nthing can be one only through participation in some unity extrinsic to\nit, which (to avoid infinite regress) must be purely one and not also\nmany. Kind\u00ee also argues that any many is a collection of ones:\nand since everything is either one or many, and any many depends on\nones, and any one depends on a pure one, and God is the only\npure one, everything owes its existence directly or indirectly to God.\nWhile Kind\u00ee, like F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, gives a long list of\ndifferent kinds of things that can be said to be one, and while he has\ndifferent reasons for disqualifying each of them from being a pure\none, i.e., a one that is not also many, typically he seems to think\nthat each of these senses of \u201cone\u201d is predicated of some\nsubject which is many, so that if the unity were removed, that\nunderlying multiplicity would remain. Kind\u00ee infers that each of\nthese ones is a many-that-is-one, and therefore that it has contrary\nattributes, and therefore that it is not essentially one, and even\nthat it is only metaphorically one, since (as he argues in a tradition\ngoing back to Zeno of Elea and to the first Hypothesis of\nPlato\u2019s Parmenides) for something to be truly one is\nfor it not to be many in any way, e.g., by having many\n constituents.[34]\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee by contrast maintains, following Aristotle in\nMetaphysics IV,2, that unity is coextensive with being, and\nthat both \u201cone\u201d and \u201cbeing\u201d are truly and\nproperly said of many things. Indeed, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee claims,\nnot just that these many things are each truly being and truly one,\nbut that they are essentially so, i.e., that they are not\nbeing and one [mawj\u00fbd, w\u00e2\u1e25id]\nthrough an existence or unity [wuj\u00fbd,\nwa\u1e25da] which is accidental to them or extrinsic to\ntheir quiddity, as something is white through an accident of\nwhiteness. There are senses of being, notably being as the true, in\nwhich existence is accidental, but in the primary sense of being, and\nthe sense of primary interest to the metaphysician, the things\u2019s\nexistence is its quiddity or part of its quiddity; and so too,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee claims, for the unity corresponding to the\nsense of \u201cone\u201d of primary interest to the metaphysician,\nwhich is convertible with this sense of \u201cbeing\u201d. In order\nfor F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee to deflect Kind\u00ee\u2019s arguments\nagainst the claim that there are many things that are each truly and\nessentially one, it is crucial for him not only to distinguish\ndifferent senses of \u201cone\u201d, but also to distinguish\ndifferent ways that senses of \u201cone\u201d can be related to\nsenses of \u201cmany\u201d. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee distinguishes\nbetween a many that is the subject of a one, a many that is\nopposite to a one, and a many that arises from a\none. When F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that some sense of\n\u201cmany\u201d is the opposite of some sense of\n\u201cone\u201d, he apparently means that these kinds of unity and\nmultiplicity are contraries or that one of them is the privation of\nthe other. When he talks about a many that arises from a one,\nhe seems to mean what Aristotle calls a many that is \u201cmeasured\nby\u201d a one, i.e., a many composed out of ones of this type, so\nthat the one or unit can be used to count the many. (Aristotle says in\nMetaphysics X that in this kind of one-many\nrelationship the unity and the multiplicity are correlatives,\nas the measure and the measured, whereas when one and many are related\nas indivisible and divisible, unity as indivisibility is a\nprivation of multiplicity as divisibility. Or perhaps he\nreally means that, although from the point of view of our language and\nour concepts divisibility is the more basic and indivisibility is its\nprivation, in reality indivisibility is basic and divisibility is its\nprivation. In Aristotle\u2019s terminology, possession and privation\nare one kind of opposites, contraries are another, contradictories are\nanother, and correlatives are yet another. But\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee apparently does not count correlatives here\nas opposites.)\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee grants to his implicit opponent that some\nsenses of \u201cone\u201d do presuppose a many as their subject, so\nthat if the one were removed the many would remain. There are\ntwo-place senses of \u201cone\u201d, as there are two-place senses\nof \u201cbeing\u201d: for instance, we can say \u201cX and\nY are one in species\u201d. Or perhaps it is better to say,\nnot that these are two-place senses of \u201cone\u201d, but that\nthey are plural-subject senses, since we can equally well say\n\u201cX and Y and Z are one in\nspecies\u201d. In any case F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee grants that there\nare several senses of \u201cone\u201d which presuppose a many as\ntheir subject. Perhaps surprisingly, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee includes\nhere not only \u201cone in species\u201d and the like but also\n\u201cone in number\u201d: he thinks that the appropriate expression\nis not, e.g., \u201cAristotle is one in number\u201d but\n\u201cPlato\u2019s best student and Alexander\u2019s teacher are\none in number\u201d. Also perhaps surprisingly, he tries to trace\nback the other plural-subject senses of \u201cone\u201d to\n\u201cone in number\u201d, saying for instance that if X\nand Y are one in species, then the species of X and\nthe species of Y are one in number (#1\u2013#8).\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also grants that there are some senses even\nof the one-place predication \u201cX is one\u201d which\npresuppose, not a plural subject, but still a subject consisting of\nmany parts, so that for X to be one is for X\u2019s\nparts to be related in an appropriate way. For instance, for\nX to be one as continuous is for X to have parts\nwhose limits are the same; for X to be one as contiguous is\nfor X to have parts whose limits, while not the same, are\nkept in contact by some bond; for X to be one as whole as for\nX to have all the parts it needs in order to perform its\nactivity well (#9\u2013#15). But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that\nwhere many things are said to be one, or where something is said to be\none in a way presupposing that it has many parts, this sense of\n\u201cmany\u201d and this sense of \u201cone\u201d are not\nopposite: nothing is predicated of its opposite. Thus the opposite of\none-in-number is many-in-number, but the subject of one-in-number is\nmany names or descriptions of the same thing; the opposite of\none-as-continuous is discretely many things disconnected from each\nother, but the subject of one-as-continuous is magnitude.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee insists equally emphatically that there are\nsenses of \u201cone\u201d that are not plural-subject senses and do\nnot presuppose a subject with many parts, and indeed in some cases\ncontradict having a subject with many parts. One sense of\n\u201cone\u201d is as \u201cundivided\u201d or\n\u201cindivisible\u201d (the Arabic phrase, like the Greek word, is\nambiguous between these two construals). Or perhaps rather, as\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee suggests at the end of the treatise, all\nsenses of \u201cone\u201d can be traced back in one way or another\nto being undivided (#95). Certainly there are many ways that something\ncould be divided, and filling them out leads to different senses of\none-as-undivided or one-as-indivisible. For instance, as\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee notes, \u201cone\u201d is said of something\nextended that is divisible but not actually divided; of something that\nis spatially located but quantitatively indivisible, i.e., a point; of\nwhat is not spatially located and is therefore quantitatively\nindivisible; of what has (or is) a simple quiddity not divisible into\nparts of a definition such as genus and differentia; and of what is\nnot \u201cdivided\u201d between a paronymously named subject\nX and an X-ness through which it is X\n(#20\u201324). Some of these senses of \u201cone\u201d, such as one\nin the sense of an indivisible point, are never predicated of\na many. Something can also be called one because it does not have a\npartner, i.e., because is the only F, for some predicate F,\nor if nothing else is F in the same way that it is F; and especially\nif F is its quiddity, as, e.g., the moon can be called\n\u201cone\u201d in the sense that there is nothing else of the same\nspecies as it (#25, pp.55\u20136). This sense of \u201cone\u201d,\ntoo, does not presuppose any plurality in its subject.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also talks about different senses of\n\u201cone\u201d as \u201ccircumscribed\u201d in some way (see\nbelow): at least some of these senses do not presuppose any plurality\nin their subject, and apparently in all these senses, if the subject\nthat is one were stripped of its unity, it would not become many\ninstead. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee apparently does not say that\n\u201cone\u201d in such a sense does not have an opposite, but it\ndoes not have an opposite that is a sense of \u201cmany\u201d: the\nopposite of \u201cone\u201d in such a sense would be the\ncontradictory, \u201cnot one\u201d, but not a contrary or\nprivative \u201cmany\u201d.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also insists that the many arising\nfrom some sense of \u201cone\u201d, i.e., a many composed out\nof things that are each one in this sense, is not the many\nopposite to this sense of \u201cone\u201d, although he\nadmits that in some cases the many arising from the one and the many\nopposite to the one are the same per accidens\n(#37\u2013#49). As before, there are senses of \u201cone\u201d that\ndo not have an opposite sense of \u201cmany\u201d. There are also\nsenses of \u201cone\u201d that do have an opposite sense of\n\u201cmany\u201d, but where the many that arises from the one is not\nthe same as the many that is opposite to the one. Thus the many\narising from the one as a point (the one as what is indivisible\nalthough spatially located) is many points, while the opposite of the\none as a point is a continuous extension. The many arising from the\none as having-no-partner-in-its-species might be a plurality like a\nunique moon and a unique sun (or a unique phoenix), each without a\npartner in its distinct species, whereas the opposite of\nhaving-no-partner-in-its-species is having-a-partner-in-its-species.\nThe opposite of the one as indivisible quiddity is a divisible\nquiddity; the many arising from the one as indivisible quiddity is\nseveral indivisible quiddities, which could be a divisible\nquiddity if, say, one of them is an unanalyzable genus and the others\nare successive unanalyzable differentiae of that genus, but the\nseveral indivisible quiddities need not be a single quiddity\nat all. But, beyond these examples, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nbasic point is that, in the many arising from a one, the one\nis an essential constituent of the many, \u201ca part by which its\nconstitution [is]\u201d (#62, p.75): and so it can no more be\nopposite to this one than a species can be opposite to its constituent\ngenera and differentiae. And likewise, if a one, in some sense of\n\u201cone\u201d, is what it is by being a unit, a constituent of a\nmany, then it cannot be opposite to that many, even if there is some\nother sense of \u201cmany\u201d which is its opposite.\n\nWhen F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that there are senses of\n\u201cone\u201d which do not presuppose any plurality and which have\nno opposite except a bare contradictory\u2014so that there is no\nsense of \u201cmany\u201d opposite to these senses of\n\u201cone\u201d, although there is a sense of \u201cmany\u201d\narising from each such sense of \u201cone\u201d\u2014he is\ninterested above all in the sense of \u201cone\u201d as\n\u201ccircumscribed by a quiddity\u201d (first introduced #17).\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not assume that the reader will already\nbe familiar with this analysis of a special sense of\n\u201cone\u201d: he tries to build up to it from other senses of\n\u201cone\u201d as \u201ccircumscribed\u201d in some other way. He\nstarts by talking about a \u201cbody circumscribed by a limit that\nspecifies [takhu\u1e63\u1e63u] it\u201d (#16, p.50).\n\u201cCircumscribed\u201d here has a straightforward literal sense:\nthe body is surrounded on all sides by its limit or boundary.\n\u201cSpecifies\u201d adds that everything inside that limit is the\nbody, and everything outside that limit is not the body. This may\nconnect with \u201cone\u201d as having no partner in some property,\nsince the body is the only thing inside its limit.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee passes from \u201cone\u201d as a body to a\ncircumscribed by a limit to \u201cone\u201d as a body circumscribed\nby a place, where a body\u2019s place is, on the Aristotelian\nanalysis, not the limit of the body itself but the limits of the\nbodies that surround it. Here again, everything that is in the place\nis the body, and everything that is not in the place is not the body.\nThus the limit, or the place, contributes in two ways to making the\nbody one: it makes the parts of the body one with each other, and it\nmakes the body one body distinguished from other bodies, with which it\nyields the many that \u201carises from\u201d this sense of one. The\nunity [wa\u1e25da] corresponding to these senses of\n\u201cone\u201d [w\u00e2\u1e25id] is presumably the\ncircumscription [in\u1e25iy\u00e2z] by the limit or the\nplace, which is an accident of an underlying\n subject.[35]\n But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee denies that if this unity were removed,\nits subject would thereby become a many: rather, it would fuse with\nother things into a larger one when the circumscription separating\nthem from each other is removed (#28). Still, these kinds of unity do\nalso unify a divisible subject, as do the unity of what is\none as continuous or contiguous or whole. But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nis building up to a less familiar but more fundamental, non-spatial\nkind of circumscription which has only the function of distinguishing\na one from other ones and not the function of uniting a plurality.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee talks about the circumscription of a thing by\nany attribute, which would include limits and places and other\naccidents such as qualities (some examples at #78), but he\nconcentrates overwhelmingly on the circumscription of a thing by its\nquiddity. This can happen at different levels of generality\u2014it\ncan be a specific or a generic quiddity (#27). What is circumscribed\nby a quiddity, unlike what is circumscribed by a limit or a place,\nneed not be a body and need not be divisible, but can be as general as\n\u201cbeing\u201d or \u201cthing\u201d (#64). In some cases, if a\nthing\u2019s circumscription by its quiddity were removed, it would\nfuse into a one with other ones when it the attributes distinguishing\nit from these others are removed, as a body circumscribed by a limit\nor place would fuse into a one with other bodies when its\ncircumscription by its limit or place is removed. If a thing\u2019s\ncircumscription by its specific quiddity were removed, it would still\nbe circumscribed by its generic quiddity, and would fuse into a one\nwith the other things in its genus, but if all\ncircumscription by a quiddity were removed from it, there would no\nlonger be anything left at all (#27). So there is no opposite to this\nsense of \u201cone\u201d except sheer non-being (#27): there is a\nsense of \u201cmany\u201d arising from this sense of\n\u201cone\u201d, but it is not opposite to this sense of\n\u201cone\u201d (#49). The cases of circumscription by a limit or a\nplace might wrongly lead us to think that whenever something is called\n\u201cone\u201d its unity is an accident attaching to some\nunderlying subject, but in the present case if the unity were removed\nthe quiddity would be destroyed. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does seem to\ndistinguish a thing\u2019s unity in this sense from its quiddity when\nhe says that the unity of a species, as circumscribed by its specific\nquiddity, is the differentia by which it is circumscribed from other\nspecies of its genus (#78): but this is still essential to the thing,\nand we know from the Book of Letters that the differentia can\nbe called the existence of the thing, as here it is called the unity\nof the thing.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that what is one in the strongest\n[a\u1e25r\u00e2] sense is what is circumscribed by a\nquiddity (#78). He says equally that what is circumscribed by a\nquiddity is \u201ccircumscribed by its portion [or allotment] of\nexistence [qis\u1e6d al-wuj\u00fbd]\u201d (#17), i.e., by\nits being what it is: this being-what-it-is is described in the\nBook of Letters as the existence [wuj\u00fbd] of\nthe thing, and On the One and Unity argues that it is also\nthe thing\u2019s unity [wa\u1e25da].\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee uses this analysis to try to make good on\nAristotle\u2019s programmatic claim in Metaphysics IV,2 that\nbeing and one are mutually entailing and in a way equivalent, or that\nthere is a sense of \u201cbeing\u201d and a sense of\n\u201cone\u201d, or a family of senses of \u201cbeing\u201d and a\ncorresponding family of senses of \u201cone\u201d which are mutually\nentailing and in a way equivalent. Thus here in On the One\n#17 he says that \u201cone\u201d in this meaning, i.e., the\nmeaning \u201ccircumscribed by a quiddity\u201d, is mutually\nentailing or equivalent [mus\u00e2wiq] with being. So\n\u201cone\u201d in this sense needs to apply to things in all\ncategories, not just substances, and indeed F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nsays that in #17, and he adds that it also applies to \u201cother\nthings, if there are any outside the categories\u201d (#17, p.51,\ncompare the Book of Letters on a possible ascent to a first\ncause of being to substances which would itself be outside all\ncategories including substance). Again, if \u201cone\u201d in this\nsense is necessarily coextensive with being, F\u00e2r\u00e2bi needs\nto say that not only species and genera but also individual substances\n(and individual qualities and so on) are each circumscribed by their\nown quiddity\u2014not merely by a shared quiddity and an individual\nplace or other accidental attributes\u2014so that there are\nmany things in each species, in the sense of\n\u201cmany\u201d arising from this sense of \u201cone\u201d.\n\n\nThe meaning [ma\u02bfn\u00e2] of human [i.e., the species\nhuman] is circumscribed and isolated from what is not human, i.e.,\nhorse and so on, and this human is circumscribed from\nthat human by a circumscription more perfect [or complete]\nthan the circumscription of human from horse. (#64, p.78)\n\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is thus committed to individual quiddities,\neven though our language does not allow us to formulate a\ndefinition of any individual. \u201cEvery being and every\nthing must have no partner in something which is attributed to\nit\u201d (#26, p.56), and \u201chaving no partner\u201d in turn is\nmutually entailing or equivalent [mus\u00e2wiq] with\n\u201ccircumscribed by a quiddity\u201d (#26, p.57).\n\n\n\u201cOne\u201d is said of everything that is circumscribed by a\nquiddity which specifies it [takhu\u1e63\u1e63uhu] and an\nexistence which specifies it, by which it is circumscribed from\neverything other than it, and it is one by a unity which is that by\nwhich it is circumscribed from other things. And if the quiddity of\neach thing is circumscribed from other things only by some category,\nit [i.e., this sense of \u201cone\u201d] is equivalent to the\n\u201cbeing\u201d that signifies the categories, and to whatever\nelse is equivalent to \u201cthing\u201d. (#94,\n pp.101\u2013102)[36]\n\n\nThus F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s analyses of the senses of\n\u201cbeing\u201d in the Book of Letters, and of the senses\nof \u201cone\u201d in On the One, give the basis for his\naccount of a \u201ctranscendental\u201d sense of \u201cone\u201d\nin which it is mutually entailing with \u201cbeing\u201d, and also\nfor his account of how unity and existence are predicated of God (see\nthe next section): once we distinguish the different senses, and\nunderstand how they are related, we will see that circumscription by a\nquiddity is both the strongest sense of existence and the strongest\nsense of unity. And since every being in every category, individual or\nuniversal, is circumscribed by a quiddity,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s analysis allows him to vindicate his\nclaim against Kind\u00ee that each of these things is truly one, and\nindeed essentially one.\n4. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s philosophical theology: the Perfect City and Political Regime\n\nFinally, we turn to metaphysical texts where F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ntries to do what in the Enumeration of the Sciences he says\nthat the \u201cthird part of the divine science\u201d does: namely,\nto show that there are beings separate from bodies, culminating in a\nfirst uncaused being which has no partner and no contrary, contains no\nmultiplicity, is one, being, and true in a stronger sense than\neverything else, is the first cause of existence, unity and truth to\neverything else, and satisfies (some interpretation of) the other\ntraditional divine attributes; and then to show how this first being\nacts to produce other beings directly or indirectly, and how its\naction relates to\n theirs.[37]\n This is also what F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee more briefly says in the\nAims of the Metaphysics that Aristotle does in\nMetaphysics XII:\n\n\nThe eleventh book [i.e., Book XII on our numbering] is about the\nprinciple of substance and of all existence, its existence and the\nconfirmation that it is knowing by its essence and true by its\nessence, and about the separate beings which are after it, and about\nhow the existence of beings depends on it.\n\n\nPresumably F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that Aristotle drew these\nconclusions on the basis of his analyses of the senses of being and\nunity, of the ways in which one kind of being [mawj\u00fbd]\ncould be prior to another being, of what a being\u2019s existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] is, of how one being can cause existence to\nanother being, and so on. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee himself undertakes\nsuch analyses in his Book of Letters and On the One,\nand in one section of the Book of Letters he sketches in a\npurely hypothetical way how they might lead to a first being that is\nbeing in the strongest sense.\n\nHowever, the two extant books where F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee tries to\ncarry out this part of metaphysics, the Perfect City and the\nPolitical Regime, are of a rather different character from\nthe texts that he wrote for an audience within the Baghdad\nphilosophical school, engaging with Aristotle\u2019s texts and trying\nto rewrite them for a modern audience. Neither of these books is\ndevoted exclusively to metaphysics: each first gives a long account of\nGod as first cause, and then an account of the heavenly and sublunar\nthings that proceed from God, before focussing on the human soul,\nhuman societies and their governance, prophecy, and the conditions for\nthe soul\u2019s successful \u201creturn\u201d to God or for more or\nless satisfactory approximations. Especially in the Perfect\nCity it is clear that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is adopting an\noverall sequence of topics from kal\u00e2m treatises, and is\ntrying to show that the methods of falsafa allow him to give\na scientific content to the knowledge of God, and a demonstrative\nresolution of the issues in dispute, which in his view the methods of\nkal\u00e2m cannot. The full titles of the two texts, the\nPrinciples of the Opinions of the People of the Perfect City\nand the Political Regime known as \u201cPrinciples of\nBeings\u201d suggest that he is trying to reconstruct and\nrewrite Plato\u2019s Republic (about which he has only\nindirect information), or perhaps a sequence of several Platonic texts\nincluding the\n Republic.[38]\n In Plato, the thesis that the best society will be ruled by\nphilosophers leads to a discussion of the objects the philosophers\nneed to know, Platonic Forms and especially the Good-itself, and this\nmay give F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee a model for including in these\ntreatises a metaphysical account of the first cause and how other\nthings proceed from it: the rulers of the best society will know these\ntruths, and other members of the society will either believe them\nwithout demonstration, or accept some imitation of\n them.[39]\n But while Plato starts with a discussion of the city and uses it to\nmotivate digressions into metaphysics, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee starts\nat the top, with metaphysics (in the Political Regime with a\nclassification of \u201cprinciples\u201d or non-bodily causes, in\nthe Perfect City with the first cause), with no prior context\nor motivation. He does not frame the metaphysics by saying\nthat this is what the people of the perfect city know or believe.\nRather, he starts from the first cause, explains how the various types\nof being in the cosmos, including human souls, depend on it, and draws\nconclusions about what sort of city would further human perfection and\nwhat its rulers or other inhabitants would have to know or believe:\nthis conforms to the structure of kal\u00e2m treatises,\nwhich typically start with God\u2019s existence and unity and\nattributes and acts, then talk about God\u2019s creation including\nhuman beings, and then about prophecy and the religious community and\nthe afterlife (\u00e2khira) or \u201creturn\u201d\n(ma\u02bf\u00e2d) to\n God.[40]\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not seem to know about the metaphysics\nof the Republic, and in any case it would not give him what\nhe needs. He fills in the content of the metaphysics from elsewhere,\nfrom Metaphysics XII as he would like it to be, guided by\nlater Greek interpreters\u2014Themistius\u2019 commentary, and texts\nof Plotinus and Proclus in their Arabic adaptations. This goes beyond\nthe actual Metaphysics XII both in that it infers to God as a\nfirst cause of existence rather than of motion, and in that it\nincludes a downward way from God to the beings that derive their\nexistence from\n him.[41]\n F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is also much more systematic than Aristotle,\nin the manner of a kal\u00e2m treatise, in showing that God\nis simple, i.e., free from all the different modes of composition, and\nis unique and has no contrary (all things that Metaphysics\nXII does briefly say), and in going through a whole series of\nattributes of God. It is plausible that both treatises are directed to\npotential princely patrons, perhaps after F\u00e2r\u00e2bi\u2019s\ndeparture from Baghdad for Aleppo and Damascus late in his life.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee would be trying to break falsafa out\nof its Christian (or Ism\u00e2\u02bf\u00eel\u00ee) ghetto and to\npresent it as a \u201creligious science\u201d superior to\nkal\u00e2m, not exclusively Muslim but suited for Muslim\nneeds: F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee presents falsafa as giving\nthe content of the ruler\u2019s or his adviser\u2019s religious\nknowledge, and implicitly presents himself as an adviser to\n princes.[42]\n Thus both the Perfect City and the Political Regime\nare supposed to be intelligible to a non-specialist audience. In\nneither case does F\u00e2r\u00e2bi show himself struggling with a\ndifficult Greek model, and while he draws on his technical analyses of\nbeing and unity from the Book of Letters and On the\nOne, this technical substructure is tastefully concealed. The\nPolitical Regime seems to stay closer to\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s Greek\n models,[43]\n and may thus be the earlier of the two texts, while in the\nPerfect City he seems to have more fully digested those\nmodels and to be presenting the results in a simpler and more\nindependent form, concentrating on the elements more central to\npresenting falsafa as a \u201creligious science\u201d to a\ncontemporary Muslim audience. But some passages remain verbally\nidentical or almost identical in the two\n treatises.[44]\n\nBoth treatises put human beings and their societies in an Aristotelian\ncosmological context, which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee describes in some\ndetail. Humans and other kinds of animals, and also plants, are\ncomposites of some kind of soul (including, for humans, a rational\nsoul) with a body composed out of the four sublunar elements, earth\nand water and air and fire; the whole sublunar world is governed,\nultimately by God, but proximately by a series of nested heavenly\nspheres (each moved by an incorporeal intelligence) and by the\n\u201cactive intelligence\u201d which is a source both of\nintellectual cognition to the human rational soul and of intelligible\norder to the sublunar world. But in what follows I will discuss only\nthe strictly metaphysical parts of these texts, not the cosmology or\nthe theories of the human soul, prophecy, or society. I will mainly\nfollow the Perfect City, while noting some interesting\ndifferences in the Political Regime. The Political\nRegime in general seems more interested in classification and\ncomparison. The human soul is introduced by being compared to various\nhigher and lower things, and the way it achieves its intended\nperfection is compared to the ways they do. Likewise, God is\nintroduced, in the prologue to the Political Regime, on a\nlist of six kinds of incorporeal \u201cprinciples\u201d of physical\nthings, and his causality is compared with the modes of causality of\nthese other\n principles.[45]\n\nThe Perfect City sweeps away this introductory framework, and\nstarts directly with the thesis-statement, \u201cThe first being\n[mawj\u00fbd] is the first cause of existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] to all other beings\n[mawj\u00fbd\u00e2t]\u201d.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s strategy is to argue that there is a\nunique \u201cfirst being\u201d, and then to derive its attributes,\nincluding that it produces other things, and indeed produces\neverything else either directly or indirectly; in the process he hopes\nto have shown that this first being has enough of the traditional\nattributes of God, suitably reinterpreted, that the readers will\nacknowledge it as God. The Perfect City never once uses the\nword \u201cGod\u201d, and this is surely a deliberate strategy. We\ncannot validly deduce \u201cGod exists\u201d, or \u201cGod is\nF\u201d for any value of F, unless we have at least one premise\ncontaining the term \u201cGod\u201d, and no such premises are\navailable. Especially in Islam it is very common to refer to God, not\nby the name \u201cGod\u201d, but by one of his attributes, and\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in the Perfect City consistently\nuses \u201cthe First\u201d, one of the standard Qur\u02be\u00e2nic\nattributes (Q\n 57:3).[46]\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not accompany the initial thesis of the\nPerfect City, \u201cThe first being [mawj\u00fbd]\nis the first cause of existence [wuj\u00fbd] to all other\nbeings [mawj\u00fbd\u00e2t]\u201d, by any explicit proof.\nWhat is his strategy for convincing the reader to accept it? On the\nface of it, there are several ways in which this thesis could be\nfalsified. There might be no first being, because every being has\nanother being prior to it, ad infinitum. Or there might be\nmany beings each of which is \u201cfirst\u201d in the weak sense\nthat it has nothing prior to it; in which case no being will be\n\u201cfirst\u201d in the strong sense that it is prior to everything\nother than itself. (We might also want clarification of what\npriority-relation F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is talking about. He does\nnot explicitly say, but he seems to mean roughly what Aristotle calls\npriority in being by contrast with priority in time and priority in\ndefinition. X is prior to Y in being if X\ncan exist without Y existing but not vice versa, or\nif neither can exist without the other existing but X is the\ncause of Y\u2019s existing.) If there is some X\nwhich is \u201cfirst\u201d in the strong sense that it is prior to\neverything other than itself, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee seems to think\nit will be clear that X is the first cause of existence,\neither immediately or by a chain of intermediate causes, to any other\nbeing Y, because every being other than the first will have\nsome cause (distinct from itself) of its existence, and because, if\n(as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee assumes) there can be no circles or\ninfinite regresses of such causes, the chain of its causes can only\nterminate in the first being X. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says\nnothing here about the infinite regress problem (although he is\ncertainly aware of the issue, and we can make plausible guesses about\nwhy he thinks the objectionable infinite regresses do not\n arise).[47]\n But he has a clear (although not obviously successful) strategy for\nshowing that there cannot be many things each of which is\n\u201cfirst\u201d in the weak sense that it has nothing prior to it,\nand therefore nothing which is prior to everything other than itself.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not immediately draw this\nconclusion: rather, it is supposed to follow from a series of\ninferences he makes about what anything that is \u201cfirst\u201d\nmust be like.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s general strategy is (1) to argue that\nanything that is \u201cfirst\u201d must not have any kind of cause,\nsince any such cause would be prior to it and it would not be first,\nand that it has no privation or potentiality (either of which would\nimply dependence on something prior); then (2) to infer that since it\nhas no cause it must be simple, i.e., that it is\n\u201cone\u201d in the sense of not having any of the different\nkinds of internal composition (e.g., out of matter and form, genus and\ndifferentia, or physically extended parts); then (3) to infer from its\nsimplicity and non-dependence that it has no partner and no contrary,\ni.e., that it is \u201cone\u201d in the sense of being unique; (4)\nthen to infer from its negative attributes (especially its\nimmateriality) to its being\n intelligence[48]\n and to the kind of intelligence it is, and then to derive its other\npositive attributes from its being this kind of intelligence (or\nsimply to reduce the other attributes to its being this kind of\nintelligence); and finally (5) to infer from its simplicity to the\nonly possible way that it can generate something outside itself. Since\nwe know that there are things other than the First, and since anything\nother than the First must derive its being directly or indirectly from\nthe First, it will follow that the First does immediately generate at\nleast one thing, a \u201cSecond\u201d; and F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nwill try to sketch how the First either directly or indirectly causes\nall the main types of constituents of the world.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s transitions from the First\u2019s\nsimplicity to its uniqueness, from its negative attributes to its\nbeing intelligence, and from its intrinsic attributes to its producing\nsomething outside it, are all high-risk moments, and will all be\nchallenged by other Arabic thinkers.\n\nWe will concentrate here on the stages of argument up through the\nuniqueness of the First, with a few comments at the end on how\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee hopes to get to its being intelligence (and\nto what kind of intelligence it is) and to its generating a Second.\nSometimes F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee just states his conclusions without\nexplicit argument, and sometimes he suggests what premisses the\nconclusion is supposed to follow from, while leaving it to the reader\nto figure out how it is supposed to follow. It is usually not\ntoo hard to fill in a broadly plausible argument. But the obvious ways\nof doing this, not drawing on any technical Farabian metaphysical\nnotions, are often disappointingly vague. We may be able to get more\nprecise, using notions from the Book of Letters and On\nthe One which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s terminology here\npoints back to.\n\nAt a first stab: F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee argues that, if something is\n\u201cfirst\u201d in the sense that nothing is prior to it, it\ncannot be dependent on anything for its existence or for its\ncontinuation in existence. Therefore it has existed without beginning\nand will exist without end, and has no potentiality for not existing.\nIt has no efficient cause, but also no material cause: if it had a\nmaterial cause, its matter would be prior to it, and presumably it\nwould also depend on an efficient cause to turn its matter into it. It\nis less obvious how F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee wants to infer that it is\nperfect, with no deficiency or privation, but perhaps the thought is\nthat if it were deprived of F, it would have to be of such a kind that\nit could be F, and therefore it (or its matter) would be\npotentially F. And F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee apparently thinks he can\nconclude, not just that a first being has no potentiality for not\nexisting, but that it has no potentiality for any predicate that it\ndoes not have by its\n essence:[49]\n perhaps his reason is that if it were potentially F, it would depend\non something else which is actually F to make it actually F, and this\nother thing would be prior to it. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also says\nthat a first being has no final cause, and while he\nofficially says here only that there is no final cause for its\nexistence, he also thinks that there is no final cause that\nit aims to achieve through its activities, again because it\nwould be in potentiality to some perfection that it does not have by\nits essence. It also has no form, because nothing can have a form\nunless it also has an underlying matter, which has already been\nexcluded. And F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee adds another argument, that\n\n\nif it had a form, its essence [dh\u00e2t] would be composed\nout of matter and form, and if it were so then its constitution\n[qiw\u00e2m] would be through its two parts out of which it\nis composed, and its existence [wuj\u00fbd] would have a\ncause. (Walzer 1985, 58,2\u20135\n\n\nThis allows him to generalize from the case of matter and form to\nother kinds of constituents: as he says when he comes back to this\nissue after the uniqueness arguments,\n\n\nit is not divisible in account [Arabic qawl = Greek\nlogos] into things by which it is\n substantified,[50]\n since it is impossible that each part of the account which explicates\nits meaning should signify a part of what it is substantified by. For\nif it were so, the parts by which it is substantified would be causes\nof its existence [wuj\u00fbd] in the way that the meanings\nwhich the parts of a thing\u2019s definition signify are causes of\nthe existence of the thing defined, and in the way that the matter and\nthe form are causes of the existence of what is composed out of them;\nand this is impossible for it, since it is first and its existence has\nno cause at all. And if it is not divisible by these divisions, it is\neven further from being divisible by divisions of quantity or the\nother ways of being divided. (Walzer 1985, 66,8\u201368,1)\n\n\nSo any kind of composition is incompatible with its being first, since\neach of its components would be prior to it and would be a (partial)\ncause of its existence; we could also argue that the components would\nneed a cause to unify them, and that this cause would cause the\nexistence of the composite.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives a series of arguments for the\nconclusions (central from a Muslim point of view) that a First can\nhave no partner and no contrary. He does not actually use the word\n\u201cpartner\u201d here, but uses phrases like \u201cnothing other\nthan it can have the existence [wuj\u00fbd] that it\nhas\u201d. While F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives a number of arguments\nfor these conclusions, we can reconstruct perhaps the central\narguments as follows. To conclude that, if X is first, no\nother being Y can have the same existence that X\nhas, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that, if this were so, X\nand Y would not differ, and so would be the same thing, not\ntwo things. But what justifies the claim that X and\nY would not differ? F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says,\n\n\nif there were a difference between them, then that by which they\ndiffer would be other than what they share, and the thing by which\neach of them differs from the other would be a part of that by which\ntheir existence is constituted, and what they share would be the other\npart: so each of them would be divided in account, and each of its\nparts would be a cause of the constitution of its essence, and so it\nwould not be first. (Walzer 1985, 58,13\u201360,3)\n\n\nAn obvious objection is that although X, being first, must be\nsimple, Y might not be: perhaps X is wholly\nconstituted by what X and Y share, but Y is\nonly partially constituted by this common element and is partially\nconstituted by something else. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee considers this\nobjection and replies that in that case\n\n\nthe existence of the latter is not the existence of the former, rather\nthe essence of the former is simple and indivisible and the essence of\nthe latter is divisible, and therefore the latter has two parts by\nwhich it is constituted, and therefore its existence has a cause, and\ntherefore its existence is inferior to the existence of the former and\ndeficient in comparison with it, and therefore it is not existence in\nthe first rank, (Walzer 1985, 60,9\u201313)\n\n\ncontrary to the hypothesis that Y has the same existence that\nX has.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives two arguments that, if X is\nfirst, it cannot have a contrary Y. Both arguments turn on a\ndefinition of \u201ccontrary\u201d: X and Y are\ncontrary if they cannot be together in the same place or substratum,\nso that X is present in some place or substratum through\nY\u2019s being absent from it, and X is absent from\na place or substratum through Y\u2019s being present in it.\nOn the basis of this definition, Far\u00e2b\u00ee argues, first,\nthat if the First, X, were contrary to Y, then\nX\u2019s being (in some place or substratum, or being at\nall) would be conditioned on Y\u2019s absence, and therefore\nX\u2019s substance would not be sufficient to explain\nX\u2019s continuing to exist, or X\u2019s existing\nat all: so, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, X\u2019s\nconstitution [qiw\u00e2m] would not be in X\u2019s\nsubstance (alone), but would be through something else, and so\nX would not be first. Second, X and Y would\nhave to have something common that is receptive of both of them, so\nthat this common thing would persist in being and X and\nY would succeed each other in it, and so this common thing\nwould be prior to them and neither of them would be first. These\narguments are recognizably developments of Aristotle\u2019s arguments\nin Metaphysics XII against there being a pair of contrary\nfirst principles like Empedocles\u2019 Love and Strife, although\nAristotle relies on the premiss that the first principle is pure\nactuality, while F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee makes relatively little use\nof the notion of actuality and relies on the premisses that the first\nprinciple is simple and that it does not depend on anything else for\nits\n existence.[51]\n F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s conclusion that the First has no\ncontrary is not simply a special case of his conclusion that the First\nhas no partner, or as he says that \u201cnothing other than it can\nhave the existence [wuj\u00fbd] that it has\u201d, since he\ndoes not assume that contraries would have the same existence or would\nbe members of the same species or genus.\n\nBut it would be unfair to summarize F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\narguments by saying\n\n\nthe First must have nothing to be prior to it, therefore it must be\nsimple; so there cannot be two Firsts, since if there were they would\nhave something in common and something that distinguishes them, and so\nthey (or at least one of them) would not be simple.\n\n\nThis argument seems open to an immediate objection: why would they\nhave to have anything in common, except that they are both first, in\nthe sense that neither of them has anything prior to it? And being\n\u201cfirst\u201d in this sense is a mere negation\u2014indeed\nmerely the negation of a relation to something else\u2014and so\nfirstness would not be a constituent of the thing that is\nfirst, and so would not threaten its simplicity. And, while it is not\nclear that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has an adequate reply to this\nobjection, his argument is more sophisticated than this quick summary\nwould suggest, and its extra sophistication may give him more\nresources to deal with objections, including the objection that\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has not ruled out the possibility of infinite\nregresses and that there may be no First, or that there could be a\nFirst and also other things independent of the First if the chains of\ntheir causes go back ad infinitum without leading to a\nFirst.\n\nIt should be clear already that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nargument in the Perfect City uses the word\n\u201cexistence\u201d [wuj\u00fbd] a great deal, in\ncontexts where it is not obviously necessary. Why say that \u201cthe\nfirst being is the first cause of existence to all other beings\u201d\nand not just \u201cthe first being is the cause of all other\nbeings\u201d? Why say \u201cnothing other than it can have the\nexistence that it has\u201d rather than \u201cnothing other than it\nis first\u201d or \u201cnothing other than it is in the same species\nor genus as it\u201d? Why say that if X and Y are\nsimilar in one respect and different in another respect,\n\n\nthe thing by which each of them differs from the other would be a part\nof that by which their existence is constituted, and what they share\nwould be the other part: so each of them would be divided in account,\nand each of its parts would be a cause of the constitution of its\nessence, and so it would not be first\n\n\nrather than \u201cthe thing by which each of them differs from the\nother would be a part of it, and what they share would be the other\npart, and then its parts would be prior to it, and so it would not be\nfirst\u201d?\n\nWhat does it mean, for F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, to say that\nX is the cause of existence to Y, or that X\nis the existence of Y, or that X enters into the\nconstitution [qiw\u00e2m] of Y or is part of that\nby which the existence of Y is constituted? At first blush,\nthe first sentence of the Perfect City, \u201cthe first\nbeing [mawj\u00fbd] is the first cause of existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] to all other beings\n[mawj\u00fbd\u00e2t]\u201d, seems to be taking the\nposition of al-Kind\u00ee that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee had\ncriticized in the Book of Letters, according to which the\nfirst being, God, would be a separately existing existence-itself,\nsuch that everything else would come to exist by participating in it:\nthings would exist [would be mawj\u00fbd] through an\nexistence [wuj\u00fbd] as they are white though a whiteness,\nand God would be that existence. Is he here, in the Perfect\nCity, slipping into the kind of popularizing philosophy that he\nhad criticized through a logical syntax of language in the Book of\nLetters? An immediate response is that\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s position in the Perfect City\nis not the same as Kind\u00ee\u2019s, since F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ndoes not say that God is the existence of anything else. But we would\nstill want to know how God is the cause of the existence of other\nthings, and more generally what it means to say that X is the\ncause of the existence of Y, and what role this plays in\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s argument in the Perfect\nCity. And F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s positive theory in the\nBook of Letters gives us resources for understanding\nthis.\n\nAs we saw in\n Section 3.4,\n on F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s analysis in the Book of\nLetters there are two main senses of being\n[mawj\u00fbd], with corresponding senses of existence\n[wuj\u00fbd]. If \u201cbeing\u201d [mawj\u00fbd]\nmeans \u201cbeing outside the mind as it is inside the mind\u201d,\nthen the subject of which is predicated is a thought in the mind (a\nconcept or judgment), and its existence [wuj\u00fbd] is its\nrelation to something extramental, and this existence holds univocally\nof all true thoughts. Clearly this cannot be what\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee means in the Perfect City\u2014it\nwould be pointless to ask, in this sense, whether something else has\nthe same existence [wuj\u00fbd] that the First has. On the\nother hand, if \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d means \u201cbeing\ncircumscribed by a quiddity outside the mind\u201d, then the subject\nof which it is predicated is a thing really existing outside the mind,\nand, according to Book of Letters I,89, its corresponding\nwuj\u00fbd is either its quiddity or part of its quiddity.\nInterpreting wuj\u00fbd as quiddity does not make sense of\nthe Perfect City\u2019s question whether anything else has\nthe same wuj\u00fbd as the First: it would be trivially true\nthat no two distinct things could have the same quiddity, or, if we\nsay that the quiddity of a thing is just its form without its matter,\nit would still be trivially true that no two distinct\nimmaterial things could have the same quiddity. But\n\u201cpart of a quiddity\u201d works, particularly if we reflect on\nwhat kind of part of the quiddity of X could be called the\nwuj\u00fbd of X, and why. As we saw in\n Section 3.4,\n F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in the Book of Letters, following\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics VII,17, analyzes\nX\u2019s existence [wuj\u00fbd = ousia in\nAristotle\u2019s Greek] as the cause of the fact that X\nexists, and, in order to search for this cause as a middle term, tries\nto reanalyze the existential judgment \u201cX exists\u201d\nas a predicative judgment, something like \u201cY is\nX\u201d where Y is the per se subject of\nX. If X is entirely simple, then \u201cX\nexists\u201d cannot be reanalyzed in this way, but in this case there\nis no cause of the fact that X exists, and X\u2019s\nexistence [wuj\u00fbd] is identical to X without\nremainder. In cases where X can be analyzed into a subject\nand a predicate, one meaning of \u201cX exists\u201d is\nthat there is a middle term explaining why the predicate belongs to\nthe subject: and this middle term (not the linguistic expression but\nthe reality it signifies) is one of the things that can be called\n\u201cthe existence [wuj\u00fbd] of X by which it\nis constituted\u201d or \u201cthe cause of existence to\nX\u201d or \u201ca part by which its existence [is\nconstituted]\u201d. In this sense the interposition of the earth\nbetween the sun and the moon is a partial existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] of eclipse, or a part of the quiddity of\neclipse which is a cause of existence to eclipse, or a cause of the\nconstitution of\n eclipse.[52]\n Since the First is entirely simple, its quiddity cannot be spelled\nout into a definition, and so the First\u2019s existence is identical\nto the First without remainder, and there is no way that two simple\nthings can share the same existence. But the First is a \u201ccause\nof existence\u201d to a Second, or is \u201cpart of that by which\nthe existence of the Second is constituted\u201d, and similar\nexpressions, if the First enters as a cause into the real causal\ndefinition of the Second, which it does, since (as we will see) the\nSecond is constituted by its act of cognizing the First. This makes\nsense of the different things F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says in the\nPerfect City about X being the cause of existence to\nY, or X being a part of the constitution\n[qiw\u00e2m] of Y, of X and Y\nsharing the same existence. It also helps to show what the extra\ncontent is to saying \u201cX is the cause of existence to\nY\u201d rather than just \u201cX is the cause of\nY\u201d, and helps to explain\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s ground for his assumption that there\nis a First, i.e., that there is not an infinite regress of causes of\nexistence: if X is the cause of Y, X counts\nas the cause of existence to Y only if X would be\nmentioned in a causal definition of Y, i.e., if it is\nessential to Y to be caused by X, so that a\nY not caused by X would not really be a Y.\nIf there were an infinite regress of causes of existence to\nX, it would follow that the causal definition of X\nwould be infinitely long, which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee presumably\nregards as absurd, as does Aristotle in Metaphysics II,2.\nThere may well be an infinite regress of causes of\ncoming-to-be, e.g., the infinite chain of my ancestors, but\nbecause these are not causes of existence, which would enter\ninto the quiddity of the effect and so would be mentioned in its\nscientific definition, they do not lead to the absurdity of an\ninfinitely long definition.\n\nAs we saw in\n Section 3.4,\n Book of Letters I,92 sketches out a program for finding a\nchain of causes of existence, where each cause enters into the\nquiddity of its effect and has a stronger claim to the title of\n\u201cbeing\u201d [mawj\u00fbd]. A substance is a cause of\nexistence to the accidents proper to it, and enters into their\nquiddity, but then there will be a hierarchy of causes of existence\nwithin the category of substance itself, until we reach some first\nsubstance, \u201cwhether this is one or more than one\u201d, which\nhas a stronger claim to the title of \u201cbeing\u201d than all\nother substances, and a fortiori than accidents.\n\n\nAnd if something is discovered outside all these categories which is\nthe cause of the realization of the quiddity of the most fundamental\nthing in this category [i.e., the category of substance], then this is\nmore deserving to be called \u201cbeing\u201d\n[mawj\u00fbd] than the most perfect thing in this category,\nand this is the first cause of existence [wuj\u00fbd] to the\nmost perfect thing in this category, and this most perfect thing [sc.\nwithin the category of substance] is the cause in the quiddity of the\nother things in this category, and what is in this category is the\ncause in the quiddity of the other categories: thus the beings, where\nwhat is meant by \u201cbeing\u201d is what has a quiddity outside\nthe soul, are ordered by this order. (Book of Letters\n I,92)[53]\n\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in the Perfect City and\nPolitical Regime claims to have shown that there is indeed\nexactly one such first being, which enters as an essential cause into\nthe quiddities of other things. The claim is not that the First acts\non each quiddity, from \u201coutside\u201d the quiddity, to give\nthat quiddity actual existence, but rather that whatever\nimmediately depends on the First is essentially constituted\nby its act of cognizing the First, so that a full account of what the\nSecond is necessarily involves the First; and lower things are\nessentially constituted by their relations to these higher things, and\nso are essentially dependent on the First.\n\nThe Perfect City and Political Regime make\nparticularly striking use of F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\n\u201cgeneral\u201d metaphysical treatises, the Book of\nLetters and On the One, in their accounts of the senses\nin which the First is one. The Perfect City and\nPolitical Regime go through a list of attributes of God, and\ntry to show that (and in what sense) each of them belongs to the\nFirst, and from a Muslim point of view one of God\u2019s most\nimportant attributes is that he is one\u2014first in the\nsense that there is no other god, and then also in the sense that he\ncontains no internal multiplicity. The Perfect City marks\nseveral senses in which the First is \u201cone\u201d. It is one in\nthat no other being shares its species of existence (66,5\u20137),\nand it is one in that it is \u201cundivided\u201d or\n\u201cindivisible\u201d, into quantitative parts or any other kind\nof parts (68,2\u20136); but then, finally,\n\n\nif the First is indivisible in its substance then the existence by\nwhich it is circumscribed [yan\u1e25\u00e2zu] from\nexistences other than it cannot be other than [the existence] by which\nit exists [is mawj\u00fbd] in itself, and therefore it is\ncircumscribed from what is other than it through a unity which is its\nessence [i.e., through a unity which it is, not through a\nunity distinct from itself]. For one of the meanings of unity is the\nspecific existence [wuj\u00fbd\n kh\u00e2\u1e63\u1e63][54]\n by which each being is circumscribed from what is other than it: this\nis that by which every being is called one inasmuch as it exists [is\nmawj\u00fbd] in respect of the existence which specifies it,\nand this is the meaning of \u201cone\u201d which is coextensive with\nexistence. So the First is one in this way too, and is more deserving\nof the name and meaning of \u201cone\u201d than any one other than\nit.\n\n\nHere the Perfect City is relying on the conclusion of the\nBook of Letters that \u201ccircumscribed by its\nquiddity\u201d is one of the meanings of \u201cbeing\u201d and the\nconclusion of the On the One that \u201ccircumscribed by its\nquiddity\u201d is one of the meanings of \u201cone\u201d, and using\nthese conclusions to interpret Aristotle\u2019s claim in\nMetaphysics IV,2 that \u201cbeing\u201d and\n\u201cone\u201d are mutually entailing. Any being X has a\n\u201cspecific existence\u201d which \u201ccircumscribes it\u201d,\ni.e., distinguishes it from all other things, and it is one\nin the sense that it is uniquely specified by this existence. If\nX is a member of a species, then X\u2019s\n\u201cspecific existence\u201d might include the matter or the place\nor other accidental attributes which distinguish X from other\nmembers of the same species. But, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is saying,\nif X is the First and therefore indivisible in its substance,\nit cannot have both a quiddity which it shares with other things and\nthen a distinct \u201cspecific existence\u201d which distinguishes\nit from those other things. So because it is one both as\n\u201cunique\u201d and as \u201cindivisible\u201d, its unity, that\nby which it is one, is completely identical with the quiddity by which\nit exists [is a being]. Here, as with the other attributes which he\ndemonstrates of the First, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is paralleling the\nMu\u02bftazilite pattern of asserting that, for any attribute F such\nthat we can say that God is F, the F-ness through which God is F is\nidentical with the divine essence. But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee claims\nto have based his account of the First and its attributes on\ndemonstrations grounded in analyses of the meanings of being, unity,\nintelligence and the other fundamental philosophical concepts;\nwhereas, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee would say, when the\nMu\u02bftazilites say that God is F through an F-ness which is\nidentical with his essence, and therefore is F in a different way from\ncreatures, this is bare assertion to save their theses that God is\nsimple and that he is nonetheless F, and does not rest on an analysis\nof a special sense of F that applies to God and how it relates to more\nordinary senses of F. In the cases of being and unity, the special\nmetaphysics of the Perfect City and Political Regime\nis supposed to rest on the general metaphysics of the Book of\nLetters and On the One, and is supposed to vindicate\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s claim that Aristotelian general\nmetaphysics, when properly understood, will give the path to a\nscientific special metaphysics.\n\nWe conclude by briefly sketching two further, and problematic, key\nsteps in the metaphysical section of the Perfect City and\nPolitical Regime, namely F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nargument that the First is both intelligence [\u02bfaql =\nGreek nous] and intelligible [ma\u02bfq\u00fbl =\nno\u00eaton], and his argument that the First is a cause of\nexistence to other things, and immediately to a single Second, the\nimmaterial intelligence which moves the outermost sphere (in the\nPerfect City), or to a small finite number of Seconds, the\nimmaterial intelligences which move the different heavenly spheres (in\nthe Political Regime). By arguing that the First is\nintelligence and intelligible, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee tries to\nderive versions of the attributes of knowledge and truth standardly\nascribed to God, and by arguing that it produces a Second he tries to\nderive a version of the act of creation standardly ascribed to God.\nBut he is deriving radically stripped-down versions of these\nattributes and acts, since the First directly knows only itself, and\ndirectly creates only the Second (or a few Seconds), even if it may be\nsaid as a consequence to indirectly know and create other things\ntoo.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s basic steps in arguing that the First\nis intelligence and intelligible are the premisses that\n\n\nwhat prevents the form from being intelligence and from actually\nintellectually cognizing is the matter in which the thing exists\n\n\nand that\n\n\nwhat prevents the thing from being intelligible in actuality [or\n\u201cfrom being intellectually cognized in actuality\u201d] and\nfrom being by its substance intelligible [or \u201cintellectually\ncognized\u201d] is also matter. (Walzer 1985, 70)\n\n\nSince the First has no matter, it would follow that it is actually\nintelligence and actually intellectually cognized.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s first premiss, that anything would be\nintellectually cognizing if it did not have a matter blocking it,\ninitially seems strange and ill-motivated. But\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee would see the second premiss, that matter is\nthe obstacle to something\u2019s being intellectually cognized, as\ngrounded in an Aristotelian analysis of intellectual cognition: the\nmind intellectually cognizes the form of a material thing precisely by\nabstracting it from its matter, and if the object had no matter to\nbegin with, then there is nothing further to do to it and it is\nalready intellectually\n cognized.[55]\n And F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee apparently sees the first premiss as\nfollowing from the second: if X is intrinsically without\nmatter, it is actually intellectually cognized intrinsically,\nand not through a relation to something else which would cognize it:\nand this can only because it actually intellectually cognizes\nitself, and does so intrinsically or essentially, not in\ndependence on some other\n cause.[56]\n Following this Aristotelian analysis, the First\u2019s act of\nintellectually cognizing its object would not be an accident\nof the First, but would be its essence; put the other way around, the\nFirst would be an intelligence, not by being a power for\nintellectually cognizing various objects, but by being an act\nof cognizing its object, namely the First itself. So, as\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says,\n\n\nthat it is intelligence [or \u201cintellectual cognition\u201d] and\nthat it is intellectually cognized and that it is intellectually\ncognizing are all a single essence and a single undivided substance.\n(Walzer 1985,\n 70)[57]\n\n\nOr, as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says in switching from the\nAristotelian language of \u201cintelligence\u201d to the\nQur\u02be\u00e2nic and kal\u00e2m language of God\u2019s\nattribute of knowledge, the First\u2019s knowledge does not require\nanything other than itself for it to know, and its knowledge is\nidentical with its essence (Walzer 1985, 72). This sounds like the\nMu\u02bftazilites in claiming to reconcile God\u2019s knowledge with\nhis simplicity. But while the Mu\u02bftazilites try to show how\nGod\u2019s knowledge can be simple and eternal despite God\u2019s\nknowing a vast plurality of things, some of which change,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee short-circuits the problem by saying that\nGod\u2019s knowledge is just knowledge of himself. Perhaps\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee would say that the problem just cannot be\nsolved if we assume that God is omniscient. Or perhaps he would say,\nwith Themistius (followed by many medieval philosophers), that God in\nknowing himself also implicitly knows other things because he is a\ncause of those other things.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also applies his groundwork from the Book\nof Letters to save the Qur\u02be\u00e2nic attribute that God is\n\u201ctrue\u201d or \u201ctruth\u201d [al-\u1e25aqq].\nThe First is \u201ctruth\u201d [\u1e25aq\u00eeqa] in the\nsense in which the \u1e25aq\u00eeqa of X is the\nquiddity of X, i.e., the existence [wuj\u00fbd]\nwhich specifies X as distinct from all other things, which\nmight be expressed by the definition or the ultimate differentia of\nX; and, as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has already argued, there\nis no distinction between the First itself and the existence by which\nthe First is distinguished from other things. Also, if S\nthinks X in a way that corresponds to the way X is\nin itself, S\u2019s thought of X can be called\n\u201ctrue\u201d [\u1e25aqq], and X can also be\ncalled true insofar as it corresponds to S\u2019s thought of\nX. Since the First knows itself, it can be called\n\u201ctrue\u201d in this sense through itself, apart from any\nrelation to anything outside itself; and because this is essential to\nit, the \u201ctruth\u201d [\u1e25aq\u00eeqa] through\nwhich it is \u201ctrue\u201d in this sense is not anything other\nthan itself (Walzer 1985, 74). For the First to be \u201ctruth\u201d\nin this second sense seems to be equivalent to its being essentially\nintellectually cognized.\n\nIn passing from the First as intelligence to the First as causing\nbeing, F\u00e2r\u00e2bi is passing, in kal\u00e2m terms,\nfrom God\u2019s attributes to God\u2019s acts. His account of the\nFirst as intelligence was perhaps less concerned to show that God has\nknowledge, more concerned to show that God\u2019s knowledge is\nidentical with his essence, and to show in consequence the differences\nbetween the way that God knows and the ways that other things know.\nHis account of the First as causing being to other things, or (in\nkal\u00e2m terms) of God\u2019s act of creation, does not\nattempt to deduce, starting from what we have shown about the First,\nthat it must create other things rather than remaining in isolation.\nHe does say that\n\n\nwhen the First exists with the existence which it has, it necessarily\nfollows that there exist from it all the other beings whose existence\nis not by human will and choice, with the existences which they have,\n(Walzer 1985, 88,11\u201314)\n\n\nbut he gives no argument that the First\u2019s existence entails the\nexistence of other things. Rather, he seems to rely on the argument\nthat since other things in fact exist, their existence must ultimately\nbe caused by the First; his main concern is not to show that\nthe First causes the existence of other things, but to show\nhow it causes the existence of other things, and in\nparticular to show that that by which the First causes the existence\nof other things is identical with its essence, just as that by which\nthe First knows is identical with its\n essence.[58]\n As F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, \u201cit is not divided into two\nthings, such that the substantiation of its essence is by one of them\nand something else\u2019s arising from it is by the other\u201d\n(Walzer 1985, 92,3\u20135): as he says a bit further down, the First\ndoes not require an accident or a motion in itself in order for\nsomething else to arise from it. (Nor is it affected or moved\nby something else\u2019s arising from it, since it cannot be\naffected or moved at all.) Nor, more generally, does the First require\nanything other than its essence\u2014whether an accident or\nmotion that would inhere in the First itself, or an external\ninstrument or material substrate that the First would cooperate with\nin producing some effect\u2014in order for something other than\nitself to arise from it. The First does cooperate with external\ninstruments and material substrata in producing some of its\neffects, and this is important for F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in\nexplaining how it can produce a plurality of effects, and how it can\nproduce more and less perfect effects, and how it can produce effects\nwhich are connected or \u201cordered\u201d rather than independent\nof each other. But the First must be able to produce at least some\nfirst effect without an instrument or substratum, or it would not be\nable to produce anything at all, and in that first case the existence\nof the First must be a sufficient cause of the existence of its\neffect.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives no further explanation of how or why\nthe existence of X can be a sufficient cause of the existence\nof Y. (He says that the existence of Y\n\u201cemanates\u201d [using the root f-y-\u1e0d] from the\nexistence of X, but this is just a technical term meaning\nthat X\u2019s existence, rather than some further act of\nX, causes Y to exist; the term\n\u201cemanation\u201d does not explain how this happens,\nand F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not pretend that it does.) He just\ninfers that this must happen in some cases, since more than one thing\nexists. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s situation is analogous to\nAristotle\u2019s in Metaphysics XII. After Aristotle has\nargued that the existence of motion presupposes a first cause which is\nessentially pure actuality, and which therefore cannot be changed or\nmoved, he faces the problem of explaining how such a cause can move\nsomething else. Aristotle answers that while an eternally unchanging\ncause cannot, by itself, cause changing motions, it can cause an\neternally constant motion (such as the eternal rotation of a heavenly\nsphere around its axis) if it causes it as a final cause, as\nan object desired by the object in motion. This leaves many\npuzzles\u2014why should this desire lead a heavenly sphere to move in\ncircles, how will that help it attain the desired object\u2014but\nAristotle can say that since every other kind of causality is\nimpossible, this is what must be happening even if we don\u2019t\nunderstand the details. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee faces a similar\ndifficulty in explanation, but he finds Aristotle\u2019s solution\nunsatisfying, not so much because these details are missing, as\nbecause it does not explain why the heavenly spheres, or their\nincorporeal movers other than the First exist\u2014at best, Aristotle\nassumes that the incorporeal substances and the spheres exist, and\nexplains why the spheres move. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, by contrast,\nhas undertaken to understand the First as a cause of\nexistence; and final causality, even if it is sufficient to\nexplain the motion of an already existent substance, does not seem\nsufficient to explain the existence of substances other than the\nFirst, either the heavenly spheres or their incorporeal movers. The\nFirst must cause existence before it can cause motion, and in fact\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not make it a mover at all, but rather\nsays that it is responsible for the existence of something which is in\nturn the first cause of motion. And if the First causes existence at\nall, it must first cause the existence of at least one thing simply by\nits own existence, not cooperating with any further attribute or\nmotion or instrument or matter. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not and\ncannot say anything about what the First does to cause the\nexistence of something else (he does not say that it causes the\nexistence of something else by thinking that thing, or even that it\ncauses the existence of something else as a byproduct of thinking\nitself); rather, he tries to describe how, and in what order, other\nthings are essentially dependent on the First.\n\nIn the Perfect City F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that the\nFirst causes existence, immediately and without cooperation with an\ninstrument or matter, only to a single thing, the Second; in the\nPolitical Regime, apparently, the First causes existence\nimmediately to several things, the Seconds. But in both treatises,\nwhen he introduces his discussion of the First as the cause of\nexistence to other things, he does not start by singling out a Second\nor Seconds. Rather, he starts by saying that \u201cthe substance of\n[the First] is a substance from which every existence emanates,\nwhatever this existence may be like, whether it is perfect or\ndeficient\u201d; (Walzer 1985,\n 94),[59]\n but he then immediately adds that \u201cwhen all the beings arise\nfrom it, they are ordered in their ranks, and each being receives from\nit the portion of existence which is due to it and the rank which is\ndue to it\u201d\n (ibid.).[60]\n But then there is a problem why the First\u2019s single simple\nexistence, assuming that it causes the existence of something else,\nshould cause a plurality of beings receiving greater or lesser\n\u201cportions\u201d of existence from it.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s answer to this problem seems to be\nless developed in the Political Regime than in the\nPerfect City. In the Political Regime, he says that\nthe Seconds (the intelligences that move the heavenly bodies), and\napparently also the \u201cactive intelligence\u201d that governs the\nsublunar world, \u201chave all received existence from the\nFirst\u201d (Butterworth 2015, 46, #34, translation modified); other\nthings depend on the Seconds or the active intelligence for their\nexistence, and for this reason receive lesser portions of existence.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says here that the Seconds, like the First,\nare such that their specific existence is sufficient for the existence\nof something else to emanate from them (ibid.): each Second produces a\nheavenly sphere composed of body and soul (it produces not merely the\nmotion but the existence of the sphere), and\nsublunar substances depend for their existence both on the heavenly\nspheres and on the active\n intelligence.[61]\n The Political Regime says that the Seconds have different\nranks (Butterworth 2015, 46, #34) but it does not say anything to\nexplain why there should be many of them or why they should differ in\nrank. In particular, it does not say that lower Seconds depend on\nhigher Seconds for their existence: each Second is described only as\nproducing a heavenly sphere, not as producing another Second, and as\nfar as we can tell each Second is produced immediately by the First\nwithout cooperation with any other cause. However, in the Perfect\nCity, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that the First, immediately\nand by itself alone, produces only a single Second (Walzer 1985, 100),\nand that all other beings are produced by the First in conjunction\nwith instruments or material substrata, where these must be either the\nSecond or things which are produced by the First in conjunction with\nthe Second. This allows F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee to explain why there\nshould be a plurality of separate immaterial substances, and why they\nshould differ in rank: the Second which is immediately produced by the\nFirst has a greater \u201cportion of existence\u201d than the Third\nwhich depends essentially on the Second, and so on, and all of these\nseparate intelligences (the movers of the heavenly spheres and then\nthe active intelligence that governs the sublunar world) have greater\nportions of existence than sublunar substances which essentially\ndepend on the heavenly spheres and on the active intelligence. Here\nF\u00e2r\u00e2bi is following out the program of Book of\nLetters I,92, discussed above, of finding a single first\nsubstance (here the Second, i.e., the mover of the outermost heavenly\nsphere) on which all other substances are essentially dependent, and\nthen tracing it back in turn to a single simple First: the causal\ndefinition of any other substance, if made fully explicit, would have\nto refer to the motion of the outermost sphere and to the Second as\nits cause, and thus ultimately to the First. But\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has the problem of explaining how a single\nSecond can be responsible for causing all this multiplicity of\nessentially differing beings. The Perfect City, like the\nPolitical Regime, stresses that the Seconds (or Second,\nThird, and so on), like the First, are each an intelligence which is\nessentially actually cognizing and is itself the object it cognizes,\nand whose specific existence is sufficient for the existence of\nsomething else to emanate from it; both treatises also stress that\nthese intelligences are also inferior to the First, notably in that\nthey do not have their full perfection purely in themselves, but only\nthrough a relation to the First, namely through intellectually\ncognizing the First. But if each of these intelligences, like the\nFirst, immediately produces only a single being like itself, they will\nnot be able to explain the multiplicity and complexity of the beings\nthat arise indirectly from the First. In the Political Regime\napparently each of the Seconds produces just a single being, namely\nthe heavenly sphere it governs (although this sphere has some\ncomplexity as a compound of body and soul, and although the active\nintelligence that governs the sublunar world has more complex\neffects), but in the Perfect City each of these intelligences\nhas to produce two beings, namely the heavenly sphere it\ngoverns and the next\n intelligence.[62]\n Thus\n\n\nfrom the First emanates the existence of the Second, and this Second\ntoo is a substance which is not embodied at all and is not in matter,\nand it intellectually cognizes itself [or \u201cits essence\u201d]\nand it intellectually cognizes the First, and its intellectual\ncognition of itself is not something other than its essence; and by\nits intellectually cognizing the First there follows necessarily from\nit the existence of a Third, and by its being substantified by the\nessence which is specific to it there follows necessarily from it the\nexistence of the first heaven. (Walzer 1985, 100)\n\n\nSo for the Perfect City, as in the Political Regime,\nthe Second, like the First, essentially cognizes itself, and there is\nno distinction between its act of cognizing itself, the existence by\nwhich it is substantially constituted, and that through which it gives\nrise to the existence of the heavenly sphere it governs. But the\nPerfect City can say that there is a distinction between this\nintelligence\u2019s cognition of itself, which is essential\nto it, and its cognition of the First, through which it\nattains a perfection, by relation to something else, exceeding what it\nhas just by itself. Or perhaps it would be better to say that its\nessence includes a relation to the First, and that its essence is\ntherefore compound, in something like the way that a species-essence\ncomposed of genus and differentia is compound.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not want to say that an immaterial\nintelligence is composed of two beings\n[mawj\u00fbd\u00e2t], such as substance and accident or\nmatter and form, but he wants to say that it has two\nexistences [wuj\u00fbd\u00e2t], that it\nis in two ways or in a compound way. His wager in the\nPerfect City is that he can explain this plurality of\nexistences in immaterial substances by the way in which they are\ncaused by the First, and that this plurality of existences will in\nturn explain how these immaterial substances can give rise to the many\ncomplex beings ultimately arise from the First.\n",
