    "main_text": "Motivating Naturalism || Current Success\n4.3 Current Success\n\n\nNaturalists are motivated by the thought that scientific or\nmathematical standards are the most successful standards we possess.\nBut what does success come to? Very roughly, the following could be\ntaken to be a mark of a discipline's success: (i) among its\npractitioners, there is a widely shared conception of the\ndiscipline's guiding questions and permissible methodology; and\n(ii) there is progress within the discipline in addressing its guiding\nquestions. One may then try to argue along these lines that physics is\nmore successful than metaphysics, that psychology is more successful\nthan parapsychology, and that astronomy is more successful than\nastrology.\n\n\nAn approach of this kind faces a twofold problem. If anything goes\nwhen it comes to methodology, all sorts of disciplines can achieve\nsuccess without thereby achieving credibility. Consider Guru-ology, the\ndiscipline that takes its guiding questions to be those enunciated by\nsome guru, and lays down as its methodology that acceptable answers are\nall and only the guru's pronouncements (perhaps assuming\nconsistency\u2014so let us assume for good measure that the guru is\nconsistent and more generally probabilistically coherent). These\nanswers could be as fanciful as you like: we leave it to the\nreader's imagination to devise examples of outlandish claims made\nby the guru. If we suppose that the guru answers each of the questions\nthat he raises, Guru-ology is therefore progressive\u2014it answers\nall the questions it raises\u2014and it is therefore successful. But\nits success speaks nothing of its credibility.\n\n\nIn general, if the success of any given set of standards S\nis gauged on its own terms, i.e., by using S-standards,\nseveral self-supporting but intuitively unacceptable sets of standards\ncount as successful. This relativism is clearly not what the naturalist\nwants. Likewise for the thought that success is to be determined by how\nwell the standards help us to \u2018cope with reality\u2019; several\nnon-scientific and non-mathematical naturalisms likewise self-vindicate\nunder this criterion. Perhaps success should instead be measured by how\nwell the standards explain and predict natural phenomena, i.e., with how\nthey cope with the subject matter of natural science. But adopting our\nusual view of how to judge success in this respect would be\nquestion-begging in favour of scientific naturalism, since scientific\nstandards are precisely the standards we have developed to cope with\nthis portion of reality. Compare an astrological naturalism motivated\nby the idea that success is to be measured by how well the standards\nexplain and predict \u2018astrological phenomena\u2019, understood as\nthe astrologers do. So if a naturalist argument based on success is to\nsucceed, some other naturalistically acceptable but non-question\nbegging understanding of \u2018success\u2019 must be found.\n\n\nThe second problem with a success argument is that success in one\nsphere is no indication of success in another. Biology is rather\nsuccessful at explaining and predicting biological phenomena. But why\nshould that give it authority over questions in mathematics or the\nphilosophy of mathematics? Likewise for other natural sciences. As we\nshall see, this point generalises.\n",
