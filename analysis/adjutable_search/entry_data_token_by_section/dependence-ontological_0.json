    "main_text": "Varieties of Ontological Dependence\n1. Varieties of Ontological Dependence\n\nA crucial notion in metaphysics is that of one entity depending\nfor its existence upon another entity\u2014not in a merely\ncausal sense, but in a deeper, ontological sense (but see Ingthorsson\n2002: 96 for discussion on the idea that causal relations could be\nunderstood as one-sided existential dependence; cf. also Bennett 2017:\nCh. 4, where it is argued that the line between causal and noncausal\ndetermination is not clear). The kind of dependence in question must\nalso be distinguished from any kind of logical dependence,\nbecause logical relations, strictly speaking, cannot obtain between\nconcrete objects, nor between abstract objects that are not\npropositional in nature. We should also distinguish ontological\ndependence, broadly conceived, from what is usually considered a\nstricter type of metaphysical dependence, namely metaphysical\ngrounding. The link between ontological dependence and\nmetaphysical grounding (or simply \u201cmetaphysical\ndependence\u201d, as it is sometimes called, see Rosen 2010 and the\nseparate entry on\n metaphysical grounding;\n see also Trogdon 2013 for discussion) will be discussed below, but\nthis entry concerns a somewhat broader family of relations of\ndependence. The notion of ontological independence is also\nimportant, and it is often used to describe the idea that something is\nfundamental. This idea as well will be discussed below (but\nsee also the separate entry on\n fundamentality).\n\nWhile much of the early work on ontological dependence was done\nprimarily in a setting where dependence was thought to be an\ninherently modal notion (e.g., Simons 1987), the recent trend\nin hyperintensional metaphysics (see Nolan 2014) has had an\nenormous impact for discussion surrounding dependence. The thought\nhere is that we need more fine-grained tools than mere necessary\nequivalence: two statements can apply to the very same entities across\nall possible worlds but not be equivalent. Here, the notion of\nessence is often invoked, and many would now regard the\nultimate basis of dependence (and indeed of modality itself) to be\nessence (see Fine 1994a, Lowe 1998, Correia 2005, and Koslicki 2012).\nFinally, it is entirely possible to deny both approaches and regard\nthe notion of ontological dependence itself as a primitive (see\nThomasson 1998: Ch. 2 and Barnes 2012: 879). Some would regard the\nnotions of metaphysical grounding or fundamentality to be similarly\nprimitive (see Fine 2012, Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005, Rosen 2010, Schaffer\n2009, and Wilson 2014). Primitivism does not mean that the notion is\nmysterious or obscure, as we can still illuminate it, e.g., by\ndescribing its instances. But it does mean that the notion is\nunanalyzable.\n\nIn what follows, the discussion will roughly follow the historical\ndevelopment, starting with the attempts to give a modal-existential\nanalysis of ontological dependence in\n \u00a72.\n As we will see in\n \u00a72.2,\n these attempts do have some serious shortcomings, even if they can be\nof use especially in certain restricted contexts. In\n \u00a73,\n we see that there are important cases where a more fine-grained,\nasymmetric notion of explanatory dependence seems warranted.\nWe will then proceed to the essentialist analysis of dependence in\n \u00a74,\n a discussion of the relationship between metaphysical grounding and\ndependence in\n \u00a75,\n finishing with a brief discussion of various other connections and\napplications in\n \u00a76.\n\nTo get us started, we may consider a few simplified examples. It is\nnot uncommon to see the notion of ontological dependence used in a\nrather coarse-grained manner, given that it encompasses a family of\nrelations. For instance, we often see claims such as:\n\n(1)\n\u201cSets ontologically depend on their members.\u201d\n(2)\n\u201cElectricity ontologically depends on electrons.\u201d\n(3)\n\u201cSocrates does not ontologically depend on singleton\nSocrates.\u201d\n\n\nWhile all of the above no doubt express some important type of\ndependence relationship, there are also important differences between\nthem. (1) may be understood as stating that a set {x, y,\nz} could not exist if its members, namely x, y,\nz, did not exist. One way to analyze the type of dependence in\nquestion is as rigid existential dependence, to be clarified\nin a moment. Another sense of dependence that could be at work in (1)\nis identity-dependence, but we will return to this later on.\nIn (2), we seem to have in mind a more general kind of dependence:\nthere could not be electricity, now or ever, if there were no\nelectrons. So the existence of electricity depends on the existence of\na very specific kind of particle, the electron. This second type of\ndependence is also existential, but to separate it from the rigid\ndependence in (1), we may call it generic existential\ndependence. (3) is a famous case borrowed from Fine (1994a,\n1994b). Singleton Socrates, expressed by \u201c{Socrates}\u201d, is\nthe set containing Socrates as its sole member. From (1) we see that\nthe set itself plausibly depends on Socrates, but since the set\nnecessarily exists when Socrates does, the dependence between them\nwould seem to be symmetric. However, (3) captures the very\nplausible idea that it is not any part of the essence or\nidentity of Socrates that it should belong to {Socrates}. So,\n(3) must refer to some form of essential dependence (or lack\nthereof in this case).\n\nWe will provide a more detailed analysis of these examples below, but\nwe can already see that a family of\u2014sometimes\ncompeting\u2014notions is beginning to emerge. However, we should\nformulate each notion somewhat more precisely. The first thing to note\nin defining ontological dependence is the modal-existential\nelement in dependence claims. For instance, we\u2019ve said that a\nset cannot exist unless its members do. So there is a sense\nin which the existence of a set necessitates the existence of\nits members. Indeed, it is common to talk about, e.g., rigid\nexistential necessitation as synonymous with rigid existential\ndependence. Typically, statements of ontological dependence are\nthought to refer to metaphysical modality (rather than, say,\nconceptual or logical modality), primarily because they concern\nmatters that are broader than just conceptual or logical. For\ninstance, substances are often considered to be entities that\ndo not depend, in a distinctively metaphysical sense, for\ntheir existence upon anything else (see Lowe 1998: Ch. 6). We can see\nthis already in Descartes, who asserts that\n\n\nby substance we can understand nothing other than a thing\nwhich exists in such a way as to depend on no other thing for its\nexistence. (The Philosophical Writings of Descartes: vol. I,\np. 210)\n\n\nThe idea of ontological dependence goes back further than Descartes\nthough, at least to Aristotle (see Corkum 2008, Koslicki 2013, and\nPeramatzis 2011), and it appears throughout the history of philosophy.\nFor instance, there is a notion of dependence operative in the\nphilosophy of John Duns Scotus, who uses it in his proof of the\nexistence of God (see the separate entry on\n John Duns Scotus,\n \u00a72.2 for details). Later, precursors to the contemporary work on\nontological dependence can be found in the work of Franz Brentano and\nEdmund Husserl; in particular, Husserl\u2019s work on the dependence\nbetween wholes and parts (for discussion, see Simons 1982 and\nJohansson 2004: Ch. 9).\n\nFinally, there are also those who are sceptical about the metaphysical\nimport of notions of ontological dependence. There are several reasons\nwhy one might consider ontological dependence relations to be\nunintelligible or unhelpful; for instance, one might think that they\nconflate other relations or that they are extraneous additions to\nbeing. However, it is commonly held among those working with\nontological dependence that these dependence relations, being\nformal ontological relations, are not additional elements of\nbeing (cf. Lowe 2006: Ch. 3). Such relations are typically thought to\nbe internal (see Armstrong 1978: 85, who defines two things\nto be internally related if and only if there exist properties of them\nwhich logically necessitate that the relation holds; for further\ndiscussion on internal and external relations, see the separate entry\non\n relations).\n Still, there is at least an ideological cost in some approaches to\nontological dependence and hence some would prefer a\ndeflationary approach. According to this type of approach, we\nmay be able to account for supposed ontological dependence relations\nin terms of a \u201ccluster\u201d of modal and mereological\nrelations (for a defense of this type of approach, see Kovacs\n2018).\n",
