Do Speech Acts Have a Logic?\n\nStudents of speech acts contend, as we have seen, that the unit of\ncommunicative significance is the Illocution rather than the\nProposition. This attitude prompts the question whether logic itself\nmight be enriched by incorporating inferential relations among speech\nacts rather than just inferential relations among Propositions.\nJust as two event-types E1 and E2 (such as running\nquickly and running) could be logically related to one another in that\nit is not possible for one to occur without the other; so too speech\nact types S1 and S2 could be\ninferentially related to one another if it is not possible to perform\none without performing the other. A warning that the bull is about to\ncharge is also an assertion that the bull is about to charge but the\nconverse is not true. This is in spite of the fact that these two\nspeech acts have the same propositional content: That the bull is\nabout to charge. If, therefore, warning implies asserting but not vice\nversa, then that inferential relation is not to be caught within the\nnet of inferential relations among propositions.\n\nIn their Foundations of Illocutionary Logic (1985), Searle\nand Vanderveken attempt a general treatment of logical relations among\nspeech acts.  They describe their central question in terms of\ncommitment:\n\nA theory of illocutionary logic of the sort we are describing is\nessentially a theory of illocutionary commitment as determined by\nillocutionary force. The single most important question it must answer\nis this: Given that a speaker in a certain context of utterance\nperforms a successful illocutionary act of a certain form, what other\nillocutions does the performance of that act commit him to? (1985,\np. 6)\n\nTo explicate their notion of illocutionary commitment, these\nauthors invoke their definition of illocutionary force in terms of the\nseven values mentioned in Section 2.3 above. On the basis of this\ndefinition, they define two notions pertinent to entailment relations\namong speech acts, namely strong illocutionary commitment\nand weak illocutionary commitment. According to the former\ndefinition, an illocutionary act S1 commits a\nspeaker to another illocutionary act S2 iff it is\nnot possible to perform S1 without\nperforming S2. Whether that relation holds between\na pair of illocutionary acts depends on the particular septuples with\nwhich they are identified. Thus suppose that S1 is\nidentical with <IP1, Str1, Mode1,\nCont1, Prep 1, Sinc1,\nStresinc1> (corresponding to illocutionary point,\nstrength, mode of achievement, propositional content, preparatory\ncondition, sincerity condition, and strength of sincerity condition,\nrespectively); and suppose that S2 is identical\nwith <IP1, Str2, Mode1,\nCont1, Prep1, Sinc1,\nStresinc1>. Suppose further that Str1 and\nStr2 differ only in that 1 is stronger than 2. Then it will\nnot be possible to perform S1 without\nperforming S2; whence the former strongly\nillocutionarily implies the latter. (This definition of strong\nillocutionary commitment generalizes in a straightforward way to the\ncase in which a set of speech acts S1,\n\u2026, Sn\u22121 implies a speech\nact Sn.)\n\nSearle and Vanderveken also define a notion of weak illocutionary\ncommitment such that S1 weakly illocutionarily\nimplies S2 iff every performance\nof S1 commits an agent to meeting the conditions\nlaid down in the septuple identical to S2 (1985,\np. 24). Searle and Vanderveken infer that this implies that\nif P logically entails Q, and an agent\nasserts P, then she is committed to believing\nthat Q. These authors stress, however, that this does not\nmean that the agent who asserts P is committed\nto cultivating the belief Q when P\nimplies Q. In lieu of that explication, however, it is\nunclear just what notion of commitment is at issue. It is unclear, for\ninstance, what it could mean to be committed to believing Q\n(rather than just being committed to Q) if this is not to be\nexplicated as being committed to cultivating the belief\nthat Q.\n\nOther approaches attempt to circumvent such problems by reductively\ndefining the notion of commitment in terms of obligations to action\nand liability to error and/or vindication. Performance of a speech act\nor set of speech acts can commit an agent to a distinct content, and\ndo so relative to some force. If P and Q jointly\nimply R, then my asserting both P and Q\ncommits me to R. That is not to say that I have also\nasserted R: if assertion were closed under deductive\nconsequence I would assert infinitely many things just by virtue of\nasserting one. By contrast, if I conjecture P and Q,\nthen I am once again committed to R but not in the way that I\nwould have been had I asserted P and Q. For\ninstance, in the assertion case, once my further commitment to R is\nmade clear, it is within the rights of my addressee to ask how I know\nthat R holds; this would not have been an acceptable reply to my\nmerely conjecturing P and Q. Developing this theme,\nlet S be an arbitrary speaker,\n<\u0394lAl,\n\u2026, \u0394nAn,\n\u0394B> a sequence of force/content pairs; then:\n\n<\u0394lAl, \u2026,\n\u0394nAn, \u0394B>\nis illocutionarily valid iff if speaker S is\ncommitted to each Ai under mode\n\u0394i, then S is committed\nto B under mode\n \u0394.[19]\n\nBecause it concerns what force/content pairs commit an agent to\nwhat others, illocutionary validity is an essentially deontic notion:\nIt will be cashed out in terms either of obligation to use a content\nin a certain way conversationally, or liability to error or\nvindication depending upon how the world is.\n\nOur discussion of the possibility of an illocutionary logic answers\none question posed at the end of Section 6.3, namely whether it is\npossible to perform a speech act without intending to do so. This\nseems likely given Searle and Vanderveken\u2019s definition of strong\nillocutionary commitment: We need only imagine an agent performing\nsome large number of speech acts, S1,\n\u2026, Sn\u22121, which, unbeknownst to\nher, jointly guarantee that she fulfills the seven conditions defining\nanother speech act Sn. Even in such a case she\nperforms Sn only by virtue of intentionally\nperforming some other set of speech acts S1,\n\u2026, Sn\u22121; it is difficult to see\nhow one can perform Sn while having no intention\nof performing a speech act at all.\n\nWe are also in a position to make headway on Cohen\u2019s Problem as\nformulated by Lycan. As argued in Green 2000, in an assertion of\n\u2018I (hereby) assert that p\u2019, a speaker commits\nherself to p even though her words do not logically entail that\nProposition; nor do they presuppose, or either conversationally or\nconventionally imply it. They do, however, illocutionarily entail it:\nanyone committed to \u2018I assert that p\u2019\nassertorically is thereby committed to p assertorically. By\ncontrast, one committed to \u2018I assert that p\u2019 as a\nsupposition for the sake of argument is not thereby committed\nto p. Accordingly, such a phrase as \u2018I assert that\u2019\nis semantically opaque (making a non-trivial contribution to the truth\nconditions of the sentences in which it occurs) but pragmatically\ntransparent in the sense that a speaker who undertakes assertoric\ncommitment to a sentence in which it has widest scope is also\nassertorically committed to its complement. Analogous remarks apply to\n\u2018I conjecture that\u2019 and the like.\n",
