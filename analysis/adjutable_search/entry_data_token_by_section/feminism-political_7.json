The philosophical debate is whether such identities are\nbased on some real difference or history of oppression, and also\nwhether people should embrace identities that have historically been\nused to oppress them. Identity politics in feminist practice is\nfraught because for some feminists, concerns about identity are\nthought to weaken feminist political unity and solidarity (Hooker\n2009; Zerilli 2005). As Emi Koyama writes in the introduction to\n\u201cThe Transfeminist Manifesto\u201d:\n\n\nThe latter half of the twentieth century witnessed an unprecedented\nbroadening of American feminist movement as the result of the\nparticipation of diverse groups of women. When a group of women who\nhad previously been marginalized within the mainstream of the feminist\nmovement broke their silence, demanding their rightful place within\nit, they were first accused of fragmenting feminism with trivial\nmatters, and then were eventually accepted and welcomed as a valuable\npart of the feminist thought. We have become increasingly aware that\nthe diversity is our strength, not weakness. (Koyama 2001: 11)\n\n\nMoreover, feminist theorists of color have shown (Davis 1981; hooks\n1981; Lorde 1984; Mohanty 1991) that the feminist movement has always\nelevated the interests of some groups and ignored or disfigured the\ninterests of others. What looks like unity or neutrality is often\nexclusion. Indeed, those for whom \u201cwoman\u201d is only one of\nseveral sources for group identification (e.g, Black women) have\nraised questions about which identity is foremost or whether either\nidentity is apt. Such questions play out with the question of\n political representation\u2014what\n aspects of identity are politically salient and truly representative,\nwhether race, class, or gender (Phillips 1995; Young 1997, 2000). The\nontological question of women\u2019s identity gets played out on the\npolitical stage when it comes to matters of political representation,\ngroup rights, and affirmative action. The 2008 U.S. Democratic Party\nprimary battle between Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\nturned this philosophical question into a very real and heated one\nfrom Black women throughout the United States. Was a Black woman who\nsupported Clinton a traitor to her race, or a Black woman who\nsupported Obama a traitor to her sex? Or did it make any sense to talk\nabout identity in a way that would lead to charges of treason?\n\nTheories of intersectionality emerged in the U.S. context from the\ngroundbreaking work of multiple thinkers (for an excellent history of\nthe emergence of \u201cintersectionality\u201d within Black feminist\nand womanist thought, see J. Nash 2019), including Kimberl\u00e9\nCrenshaw\u2019s \u201cDemarginalizing the Intersection of Race and\nSex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine,\nFeminist Theory and Antiracist Practice\u201d (Crenshaw 1989),\nPatricia Hill Collins\u2019s book Black Feminist Thought:\nKnowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment (Collins\n1990), Angela Davis\u2019s Women, Race, and Class (Davis\n1981), Audre Lorde\u2019s Sister Outsider (1984), and\nPatricia Williams\u2019s The Alchemy of Race and Rights\n(Williams 1991). While their specific language and emphasis varies,\nthese theorists and others generally agree that intersectionality is\nan analytic framework that helps to understand how oppression and\nprivilege along particular \u201caxes\u201d of identity (gender,\nrace, class, disability, and the like) do not work independently, but\nintermesh in complex ways that shape our social relations, identities,\ninterests, and experiences. The impact of this work was felt strongly\nwhere it originated in feminist legal theory (see\n feminist philosophy of law),\n and has continued to be an important concept for theories of power\nand oppression in and out of feminist political philosophy.
