    "main_text": "The Classical Republican Tradition || Republicanism and Liberalism\n3.2 Republicanism and Liberalism\n\nThe contemporary civic republican interpretation carries with it what\ncould be seen as a significant drawback, namely, that it reduces the\ndistance between classical republicanism and the mainstream liberal\ntradition. At one level, this should surprise no one. After all,\nclassical republicans and classical liberals shared many political\ncommitments (constitutionalism and the rule of law, for example), and\nmany figures are regarded as central to both traditions (Montesquieu,\nfor example). The difficulty arises, however, from the suggestion that\non the new instrumental interpretation, republicanism for all intents\nand purposes collapses into liberalism (Patten 1996; Larmore 2001).\nIndeed, at one point in his Political Liberalism, Rawls\nexplicitly states that his theory has \u201cno fundamental\nopposition\u201d with a non-perfectionist, instrumental\ninterpretation of republicanism (1993, 205). What then is the\nadvantage of civic republicanism over mainstream liberalism (Herzog\n1986; Goodin 2003; Brennan and Lomasky 2006)?\n\nThe standard reply among contemporary civic republicans is to argue\nthat there is indeed a connection between republicanism and\nliberalism, but that liberalism is \u201can impoverished or\nincoherent republicanism\u201d (Viroli 2002, 61)\u2014a bastard\noffshoot, so to speak, of what was originally a considerably more\nappealing political philosophy. The republican critique of liberalism\nis thus best understood as a critique of various problematic\ntendencies that developed within the liberal tradition as it\nincreasingly diverged from its republican roots.\n\nThe most important of these is the tendency in the liberal tradition,\nespecially beginning with Bentham, Paley, and Constant, to displace\nthe robust conception of liberty as independence from arbitrary or\nuncontrolled power with a weaker conception of liberty as\nnon-interference. The significance of this substitution will be easier\nto assess after the discussion below, but in the main it comes down to\nthis: because republican liberty is inherently incompatible with any\nform of dependency or mastery, its social implications are\nconsiderably more radical than those of mere negative liberty. This is\nprecisely why many liberal authors took pains to distance themselves\nfrom republicanism in the first place, as they openly admitted:\n\u201cthose definitions of liberty ought to be rejected, which, by\nmaking that essential to civil freedom which is unattainable in\nexperience, inflame expectations that can never be gratified,\u201d\nobserved Paley (1785, 315; cf. Pettit 1997).\n\nWhat is more, on the view of liberty as non-interference, any sort of\npublic law or policy intervention will count as an interference and,\nergo, as a reduction in freedom. Liberals committed to the received\nview of negative liberty will thus tend to be overly hostile to\ngovernment action (Pettit 1997, 2009). On the republican view, by\ncontrast, public laws or policy interventions need not always count as\nreductions in freedom. Provided the law or policy is adopted and\nimplemented in an appropriately non-arbitrary manner, the\ncitizens\u2019 freedom remains untouched. Indeed, if the law or\npolicy ameliorates dependency, or curtails the arbitrary powers some\nin the community exercise over others, freedom may be enhanced. In the\nclassical tradition, this idea was often expressed as the claim that,\nin the words of Blackstone, \u201claws, when prudently framed, are by\nno means subversive but rather introductive of liberty\u201d and thus\n\u201cwhere there is no law, there is no freedom\u201d (1765, 122).\nThe grounds for this claim will be explained further below.\n",
