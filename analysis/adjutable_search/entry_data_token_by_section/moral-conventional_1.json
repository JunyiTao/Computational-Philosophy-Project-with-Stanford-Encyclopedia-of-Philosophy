Two Facts About The Literature on the Definition of Morality\n\nThe first fact concerns the goal that philosophers who contributed to\nthe definition of morality literature were trying to\n achieve.[4]\n That goal is best explained with the help of a crucial distinction.\nOften, when we ask whether a person\u2019s judgment is moral, what we\nwant to know is whether her judgment on some moral matter is\ntrue\u2014or something in that vicinity: correct, or valid,\nor justified, or wise. What we are asking, to use Frankena\u2019s\n(1967) useful terminology, is whether the judgment is moral as opposed\nto immoral. But one point on which these philosophers were\ncrystal clear is that moral truth is not what they were\ntrying to explain. Rather, borrowing again from Frankena, what they\nwere trying to do was to distinguish moral judgments and principles\nfrom non-moral judgments and principles. They wanted to know\nhow to determine whether a person\u2019s judgment was a moral\njudgment rather than some other kind of judgment\u2014prudential, or\nreligious, or aesthetic, or legal. Whether the judgment was true, or\nvalid, or justified was simply not their concern. When considering the\nwork of Turiel and his followers, it is particularly important to keep\nthis distinction in mind, because it sometimes seems that these\nauthors, and some of their critics, don\u2019t. After\noffering evidence putatively establishing that a particular judgment\nis moral rather than conventional (and thus that it is moral rather\nthan non-moral), authors will sometimes go on to write as\nthough they had established that the judgment is true (see,\nfor example, Nucci 2001: 104\u2013106).\n\nThe second fact that will play an important role in our discussion of\nsocial domain theory concerns the outcome of the philosophers\u2019\nattempts to find a definition of morality. After decades of effort by\ndozens of authors, including some of the most eminent philosophers\nwriting in the second half of the twentieth century, the project\nfailed to reach anything close to consensus. Disagreements persisted\non just about every issue of methodology and substance. One central\nmethodological issue was whether the goal of the endeavor was\ndescriptive, aimed at characterizing how the concept of\nmorality is actually used, or normative, aimed at specifying\nhow the concept of morality should be used. Frankena took the\nproject to be normative, and he claimed a number of prominent\nphilosophers, including Richard Brandt and G.H. von Wright, as allies.\nBut other eminent figures, including R.M. Hare, H.L.A. Hart, and Alan\nGewirth, took the project to be descriptive (Frankena 1967 [1970:\n149\u2013151]).\n\nIn this philosophical literature, there is a long list of features\nthat were argued to be necessary if a judgment or a rule is to count\nas moral. Perhaps the most widely discussed of these was Hare\u2019s\nproposal that moral rules must be \u201cuniversalizable\u201d. As\nHare unpacked the notion, it required that there be no names or\ndefinite descriptions in moral rules. Another widely discussed\nproposal, also due to Hare, was that moral rules are\n\u201cprescriptive\u201d. What this means is that the\n\u201caction-guiding force [of moral rules] derives from the fact\nthat they entail imperatives\u201d (Wallace & Walker 1970b: 9). A\nthird proposal was that if an action guiding principle is a moral\nprinciple for a person, then she must regard it as \u201coverriding\nor supremely important\u201d (Frankena 1967 [1970: 155]). \u201cIn\ncases of conflict between moral and nonmoral principles, the former\nare necessarily overriding\u201d (Taylor 1978: 44; for a similar\nproposal, see Cooper 1970: 95). Yet another frequently discussed\nnecessary condition was that moral rules are behavior guiding rules\nwhose violation is met with social sanctions, \u201cthe reproach of\none\u2019s neighbors\u201d (Cooper 1966 [1970: 73]) or something\nmore serious, like ostracism (Sprigge, 1964 [1970: 129 ff]). This was\nsometimes paired with the idea that moral transgressions are followed\nby the transgressor sanctioning himself with feelings of guilt or\nshame or disliking himself (Wallace & Walker 1970: 14; Sprigge\n1964 [1970: 130]). All of these proposals were \u201cformal\u201d in\nthe sense that they did not impose any constraints on the contents of\nmoral rules or moral judgments. And this is far from a complete list\nof the formal conditions that were proposed; there were many more\n(Frankena 1963 offers an extensive list, along with many\nreferences).\n\nThere was no shortage of critics of these formal conditions.\nWittgensteinians, who maintained that \u201cmoral\u201d was a family\nresemblance term, denied that there are any necessary\nconditions for the application of the term. MacIntyre (1957), inspired\nby Sartre, argued that many moral judgments were neither\nuniversalizable nor (in Hare\u2019s sense) prescriptive. Sprigge\n(1964) offered a quite different argument against universalizability,\nas did Winch (1965). And so it went. Nothing on the long list of\nformal conditions that were proposed achieved anything even close to\nconsensus in the philosophical literature on the definition of\nmorality.\n\nEven more controversial was the question of whether more substantive\nsocial requirements should be built into the definition of morality.\nFor example, Toulmin (1950) argued that a concern for the harmony of\nsociety is part of the meaning of \u201cmoral\u201d, and Baier (1958\n[1970: 199ff]) proposed that moral rules \u201cmust be for the good\nof everyone alike\u201d. On these substantive principles, too, it is\nclear that no agreement was reached.\n",
