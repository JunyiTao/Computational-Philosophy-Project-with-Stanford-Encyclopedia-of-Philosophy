Since in political discourse there is always disagreement\nabout the possible courses of action, the identity of the\n\u201cwe\u201d that is going to be created through a specific form\nof action becomes a central question. By engaging in this or that\ncourse of action we are, in fact, entering a claim on behalf of a\n\u201cwe,\u201d that is, we are creating a specific form of\ncollective identity. Political action and discourse are, in this\nrespect, essential to the constitution of collective identities.\n\n\nThis process of identity-construction, however, is never given once\nand for all and is never unproblematic. Rather, it is a process of\nconstant renegotiation and struggle, a process in which actors\narticulate and defend competing conceptions of cultural and political\nidentity. Arendt\u2019s participatory conception of citizenship is\nparticularly relevant in this context since it articulates the\nconditions for the establishment of collective identities. Once\ncitizenship is viewed as the process of active deliberation about\ncompeting identities, its value resides in the possibility of\nestablishing forms of collective identity that can be acknowledged,\ntested, and transformed in a discursive and democratic fashion.\n\n\nWith respect to the second claim, concerning the question of political\nagency, it is important to stress the connection that Arendt\nestablishes between political action, understood as the active\nengagement of citizens in the public realm, and the exercise of\neffective political agency. This connection between action and agency\nis one of the central contributions of Arendt\u2019s participatory\nconception of citizenship. According to Arendt, the active engagement\nof citizens in the determination of the affairs of their community\nprovides them not only with the experience of public freedom and\npublic happiness, but also with a sense of political agency and\nefficacy, the sense, in Thomas Jefferson\u2019s words, of being\n\u201cparticipators in government.\u201d In her view only the\nsharing of power that comes from civic engagement and common\ndeliberation can provide each citizen with a sense of effective\npolitical agency. Arendt\u2019s strictures against political representation\nmust be understood in this light. She saw representation as a\nsubstitute for the direct involvement of the citizens, and as a means\nwhereby the distinction between rulers and ruled could reassert\nitself. As an alternative to a system of representation based on\nbureaucratic parties and state structures, Arendt proposed a federated\nsystem of councils through which citizens could effectively determine\ntheir own political affairs. For Arendt, it is only by means of direct\npolitical participation, that is, by engaging in common action and\ncollective deliberation, that citizenship can be reaffirmed and\npolitical agency effectively exercised.\n",
