Often,\nhowever, we are interested in predicting the value of Y that\nwill result if we intervene to set the value of X\nequal to some particular value x. Pearl (2009) writes \\(\\Pr(Y =\ny \\mid \\ido(X = x))\\) to characterize this probability. The notation\nis misleading, since \\(\\ido(X = x)\\) is not an event in the original\nprobability space. It might be more accurate to write \\(\\Pr_{\\ido(X =\nx)} (Y = y)\\), but we will use Pearl\u2019s notation here. What is the\ndifference between observation and intervention? When we merely\nobserve the value that a variable takes, we are learning about the\nvalue of the variable when it is caused in the normal way, as\nrepresented in our causal model. Information about the value of the\nvariable will also provide us with information about its causes, and\nabout other effects of those causes. However, when we intervene, we\noverride the normal causal structure, forcing a variable to take a\nvalue it might not have taken if the system were left alone.\nGraphically, we can represent the effect of this intervention by\neliminating the arrows directed into the variable intervened upon.\nSuch an intervention is sometimes described as \u201cbreaking\u201d\nthose arrows. As we saw in Section\n 3.1, in the\ncontext of a SEM, we represent an intervention that sets X to\nx by replacing the equation for X with a new one\nspecifying that \\(X = x\\).\n\nAs we saw in\n Section 3.2,\n there is a close connection between interventions and\ncounterfactuals; in particular, the antecedents of structural\ncounterfactuals are thought of as being realized by interventions.\nNonetheless, Pearl (2009) distinguishes claims about interventions\nrepresented by the do operator from counterfactuals. The former\nare understood in the indicative mood; they concern interventions that\nare actually performed. Counterfactuals are in the subjunctive mood,\nand concern hypothetical interventions. This leads to an important\nepistemological difference between ordinary interventions and\ncounterfactuals: they behave differently in the way that they interact\nwith observations of the values of variables. In the case of\ninterventions, we are concerned with evaluating probabilities such\nas \n\n\\[\\Pr(\\bY = \\by \\mid \\bX =\\bx, \\ido(\\bZ = \\bz)).\\]\n\n\nWe assume that the intervention \\(\\ido(\\bZ = \\bz)\\) is being performed\nin the actual world, and hence that we are observing the values that\nother variables take \\((\\bX =\\bx)\\) in the same world where the\nintervention takes place. In the case of counterfactuals, we observe\nthe value of various variables in the actual world, in which there is\nno intervention. We then ask what would have happened if an\nintervention had been performed. The variables whose values\nwe observed may well take on different values in the\nhypothetical world where the intervention takes place. Here is a\nsimple illustration of the difference. Suppose that we have a causal\nmodel in which treatment with a drug causes recovery from a disease.\nThere may be other variables and causal relations among them as\nwell.\n\n\nIntervention:\n\n\nAn intervention was performed to treat a particular patient with\nthe drug, and it was observed that she did not recover.\nQuestion: What is the probability that she recovered,\ngiven the intervention and the observed evidence?\nAnswer: Zero, trivially.\n\n\n\nCounterfactual: \n\n\nIt was observed that a patient did not recover from the\ndisease.\nQuestion: What is the probability that she would have\nrecovered, had she been treated with the drug?\nAnswer: Nontrivial. The answer is not necessarily\nzero, nor is it necessarily P(recovery | treatment).\nIf we know that she was in fact treated, then we could infer that she\nwould not have recovered if treated. But we do not know whether she\nwas treated. The fact that she did not recover gives us partial\ninformation: it makes it less likely that she was in fact treated; it\nalso makes it more likely that she has a weak immune system, and so\non. We must make use of all of this information in trying to determine\nthe probability that she would have recovered if treated.\n\n\n\n\nWe will discuss interventions in the present section, and\ncounterfactuals in\n Section 4.10\n below.\n\nSuppose that we have an acyclic structural equation model with\nexogenous variables \\(\\bU\\) and endogenous variables \\(\\bV\\). We have\nequations of the form \n\n\\[X_i = f_i (\\bPA(X_i), U_i),\\]\n\n\nand a probability distribution \\(\\Pr'\\) on the exogenous variables\n\\(\\bU\\). \\(\\Pr'\\) then induces a probability distribution P on\n\\(\\bV\\). To represent an intervention that sets \\(X_k\\) to \\(x_k\\), we\nreplace the equation for \\(X_k\\) with \\(X_k = x_k\\). Now \\(\\Pr'\\)\ninduces a new probability distribution P* on \\(\\bV\\) (since settings\nof the exogenous variables \\(\\bU\\) give rise to different values of\nthe variables in \\(\\bV\\) after the intervention). P* is the new\nprobability distribution that Pearl writes as \\(\\Pr(\u2022 \\mid \\ido(X_k\n= x_k))\\).\n\nBut even if we do not have a complete SEM, we can often compute the\neffect of interventions. Suppose we have a causal model in which the\nprobability distribution P satisfies MC on the causal DAG \\(\\bG\\) over\nthe variable set \\(\\bV = \\{X_1, X_2 ,\\ldots ,X_n\\}\\). The most useful\nversion of MC for thinking about interventions is MCFactorization (see\n Section 4.2),\n which tells us: \n\n\\[\\Pr(X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_n) = \\prod_i \\Pr(X_i \\mid \\bPA(X_i)).\\]\n\n\nNow suppose that we intervene by setting the value of \\(X_k\\) to\n\\(x_k\\). The post-intervention probability P* is the result of\naltering the factorization as follows: \n\n\\[\n\\Pr^*(X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_n) = \\Pr'(X_k) \\times \\prod_{i \\ne k} \\Pr(X_i \\mid \\bPA(X_i)),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Pr'(X_k = x_k) = 1\\). The conditional probabilities of the\nform \\(\\Pr(X_i \\mid \\bPA(X_i))\\) for \\(i \\ne k\\) remain unchanged by\nthe intervention. This gives the same result as computing the result\nof an intervention using a SEM, when the latter is available. This\nresult can be generalized to the case where the intervention imposes a\nprobability distribution \\(\\Pr^{\\dagger}\\) on some subset of the\nvariables in \\(\\bV\\). For simplicity, let\u2019s re-label the\nvariables so that \\(\\{X_1, X_2 ,\\ldots ,X_k\\}\\) is the set of\nvariables that we intervene on. Then, the post-intervention\nprobability distribution is: \n\n\\[\n\\Pr^*(X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_n) = \\Pr^{\\dagger}( X_1, X_2 ,\\ldots ,X_k) \\times \\prod_{k \\lt i \\le n} \\Pr(X_i \\mid \\bPA(X_i)).\n\\]\n\n\nThe Manipulation Theorem of SGS (2000: theorem 3.6)\ngeneralizes this formula to cover a much broader class of\ninterventions, including ones that don\u2019t break all the arrows\ninto the variables that are intervened on.\n\nPearl (2009: Chapter 3) develops an axiomatic system he calls the\ndo-calculus for computing post-intervention probabilities\nthat can be applied to systems with latent variables, where the causal\nstructure on \\(\\bV\\) is represented by an ADMG (including\ndouble-headed arrows) instead of a DAG. The axioms of this system are\npresented in\n Supplement on the do-calculus.\n One useful special case is given by the\n\n\nBack-Door Criterion. Let X and Y be variables\nin \\(\\bV\\), and \\(\\bZ \\subseteq \\bV \\setminus \\{X, Y\\}\\) such\nthat:\n\nno member of \\(\\bZ\\) is a descendant of X; and\nevery path between X and Y that terminates with an\narrow into X either (a) includes a non-collider in \\(\\bZ\\), or\n(b) includes a collider that has no descendants in \\(\\bZ\\);\n\n\nthen \\(\\Pr(Y \\mid \\ido(X), \\bZ) = \\Pr(Y \\mid X, \\bZ)\\).\n\n\nThat is, if we can find an appropriate conditioning set \\(\\bZ\\), the\nprobability resulting from an intervention on X will be the\nsame as the conditional probability corresponding to an observation of\nX.\n4.8. Interventionist Decision Theory\n\nEvidential Decision Theory of the sort developed by Jeffrey (1983),\nruns into well-known problems in variants of Newcomb\u2019s\nproblem (Nozick 1969). For example, suppose Cheryl believes the\nfollowing: She periodically suffers from a potassium deficiency. This\nstate produces two effects with high probability: It causes her to eat\nbananas, which she enjoys; and it causes her to suffer debilitating\nmigraines. On days when she suffers from the potassium deficiency, she\nhas no introspective access to this state. In particular, she is not\naware of any banana cravings. Perhaps she rushes to work every\nmorning, grabbing whatever is at hand to eat on her commute.\nCheryl\u2019s causal model is represented by the DAG in\n Figure 10.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10\n\n\n\\(K = 1\\) represents potassium deficiency, \\(B = 1\\) eating a banana,\nand \\(M = 1\\) migraine. Her probabilities are as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr(K = 1) & = .2\\\\\n\\Pr(B = 1 \\mid K = 1) & = .9, &\\Pr(B  = 1 \\mid K = 0) & = .1\\\\\n\\Pr(M = 1 \\mid K = 1) & = .9, & \\Pr(M = 1 \\mid K = 0) & = .1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nHer utility for the state of the world \\(w \\equiv \\{K = k, B = b, M =\nm\\}\\) is \\(\\Ur(w) = b - 20m\\). That is, she gains one unit of utility\nfor eating a banana, but loses 20 units for suffering a migraine. She\nassigns no intrinsic value to the potassium deficiency.\n\nCheryl is about to leave for work. Should she eat a banana? According\nto Evidential Decision Theory (EDT), Cheryl should maximize\nEvidential Expected Utility, where \n\n\\[\\EEU(B = b) = \\sum_w \\Pr(w \\mid B = b)\\Ur(w)\\]\n\n\nFrom the probabilities given, we can compute that: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr(M = 1 \\mid B = 1) & \\approx .65\\\\\n\\Pr(M = 1 \\mid B = 0) & \\approx .12\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nEating a banana is strongly correlated with migraine, due to the\ncommon cause. Thus \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\EEU(B = 1) &\\approx {-12}\\\\\n\\EEU(B = 0) & \\approx {-2.4}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nSo EDT, at least in its simplest form, recommends abstaining from\nbananas. Although Cheryl enjoys them, they provide strong evidence\nthat she will suffer from a migraine.\n\nMany think that this is bad advice. Eating a banana does not\ncause Cheryl to get a migraine; it is a harmless pleasure. A\nnumber of authors have formulated versions of Causal Decision\nTheory (CDT) that aim to incorporate explicitly causal\nconsiderations (e.g., Gibbard & Harper 1978; Joyce 1999; Lewis\n1981; Skyrms 1980). Causal models provide a natural setting for CDT,\nan idea proposed by Meek and Glymour (1994) and developed by Hitchcock\n(2016), Pearl (2009: Chapter 4) and Stern (2017). The central idea is\nthat the agent should treat her action as an intervention.\nThis means that Cheryl should maximize her Causal Expected\nUtility: \n\n\\[\\CEU(B = b) = \\sum_w \\Pr(w \\mid \\ido(B = b))\\Ur(w)\\]\n\n\nNow we can compute \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr(M = 1 \\mid \\ido(B = 1)) & = .26\\\\\n\\Pr(M = 1 \\mid \\ido(B = 0)) & = .26\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nSo that now \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\CEU(B = 1) &= {-4.2}\\\\\n\\CEU(B = 0) & = {-5.2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nThis yields the plausible result that eating a banana gives Cheryl a\nfree unit of utility. By intervening, Cheryl breaks the arrow from\nK to B and destroys the correlation between eating a\nbanana and suffering a migraine.\n\nMore generally, one can use the methods for calculating the effects of\ninterventions described in the previous section to compute the\nprobabilities needed to calculate Causal Expected Utility. Stern\n(2017) expands this approach to allow for agents who distribute their\ncredence over multiple causal models. Hitchcock (2016) shows how the\ndistinction between interventions and counterfactuals, discussed in\nmore detail in\n Section 4.10\n below, can be used to deflect a number of alleged counterexamples to\nCDT.\n\nThere is much more that can be said about the debate between EDT and\nCDT. For instance, if Cheryl knows that she is intervening, then she\nwill not believe herself to be accurately described by the causal\nstructure in\n Figure 10.\n Instead, she will believe herself to instantiate a causal structure\nin which the arrow from K to B is removed. In this\ncausal structure, if P satisfies MC, we will have \\(\\Pr(w \\mid B = b)\n= \\Pr(w \\mid \\ido(B = b))\\), and the difference between EDT and CDT\ncollapses. If there is a principled reason why a deliberating agent\nwill always believe herself to be intervening, then EDT will yield the\nsame normative recommendations as CDT, and will avoid counterexamples\nlike the one described above. Price\u2019s defense of EDT (Price\n1986) might be plausibly reconstructed along these lines. So the moral\nis not necessarily that CDT is normatively correct, but rather that\ncausal models may be fruitfully employed to clarify issues in decision\ntheory connected with causation.\n4.9 Causal Discovery with Interventions\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed how to use knowledge (or\nassumptions) about the structure of a causal graph \\(\\bG\\) to make\ninferences about the results of interventions. In this section, we\nexplore the converse problem. If we can intervene on variables and\nobserve the post-intervention probability distribution, what can we\ninfer about the underlying causal structure? This topic has been\nexplored extensively in the work of Eberhardt and his collaborators.\n(See, for example, Eberhardt & Scheines 2007 and Hyttinen et al.\n2013a.) Unsurprisingly, we can learn more about causal structure if we\ncan perform interventions than if we can only make passive\nobservations. However, just how much we can infer depends upon what\nkinds of interventions we can perform, and on what background\nassumptions we make.\n\nIf there are no latent common causes, so that the true causal\nstructure on \\(\\bV\\)\nis represented by a DAG \\(\\bG\\), then it will always be possible to discover\nthe complete causal structure using interventions. If we can only\nintervene on one variable at a time, we may need to separately\nintervene on all but one of the variables before the causal structure\nis uniquely identified. If we can intervene on multiple variables at\nthe same time, we can discover the true causal structure more\nquickly.\n\nIf there are latent common causes, so that the true causal structure\non \\(\\bV\\) is represented by an ADMG, then it may not be possible to\ndiscover the true causal structure using only single-variable\ninterventions.  (Although we can do this in the special case where the\nfunctions in the underlying structural equation model are all linear.)\nHowever, if we can intervene on multiple variables at the same time,\nthen it is possible to discover the true causal graph.\n\nEberhardt and collaborators have also explored causal discovery using\nsoft interventions. A soft intervention influences the value\nof a variable without breaking the arrows into that variable. For\ninstance, suppose we want to know whether increasing the income of\nparolees will lead to decreased recidivism. We randomly divide\nsubjects into treatment and control conditions, and give regular cash\npayments to those in the treatment condition. This is not an\nintervention on income per se, since income will still be\ninfluenced by usual factors: savings and investments, job training,\nhelp from family members, and so on. Soft interventions facilitate\ncausal inference because they create colliders, and as we have seen,\ncolliders have a distinct probabilistic signature. Counterintuitively,\nthis means that if we want to determine whether X causes\nY it is desirable to perform a soft intervention on Y\n(rather than X), to see if we can create a collider\n\\(I\\rightarrow Y\\leftarrow X\\) (where I is the intervention).\nSoft interventions are closely related to instrumental\nvariables. If there are no latent common causes, we can infer the\ntrue causal structure using soft interventions. Indeed, if we can\nintervene on every variable at once, we can determine the correct\ncausal structure from this one intervention. However, if there are\nlatent common causes, it is not in general possible to discover the\ncomplete causal structure using soft interventions. (Although this can\nbe done if we assume linearity.)\n4.10 Counterfactuals\n\nSection 3.3\n above discussed counterfactuals in the context of deterministic\ncausal models. The introduction of probability adds a number of\ncomplications. In particular, we can now talk meaningfully about the\nprobability of a counterfactual being true. Counterfactuals play a\ncentral role in the potential outcome framework for causal\nmodels pioneered by Neyman (1923), and developed by Rubin (1974) and\nRobins (1986), among others.\n\nCounterfactuals in the potential outcome framework interact with\nprobability differently than counterfactuals in Lewis\u2019s (1973b)\nframework. Suppose that Ted was exposed to asbestos and developed lung\ncancer. We are interested in the counterfactual: \u201cIf Ted had not\nbeen exposed to asbestos, he would not have developed lung\ncancer\u201d. Suppose that the processes by which cancer develops are\ngenuinely indeterministic. Then, it seems wrong to say that if Ted had\nnot been exposed to asbestos, he definitely would have developed lung\ncancer; and it seems equally wrong to say that he definitely would not\nhave developed lung cancer. In this case, Lewis would say that the\ncounterfactual \u201cIf Ted had not been exposed to asbestos, he\nwould not have developed lung cancer\u201d is determinately\nfalse. As a result, the objective probability of this\ncounterfactual being true is zero. On the other hand, a counterfactual\nwith objective probability in the consequent may be true:\n\u201cIf Ted had not been exposed to asbestos, his objective chance\nof developing lung cancer would have been .06\u201d. By contrast, in\nthe potential outcome framework, probability may be pulled out of the\nconsequent and applied to the counterfactual as a whole: The\nprobability of the counterfactual \u201cIf Ted had not been exposed\nto asbestos, he would have developed lung cancer\u201d can be\n.06.\n\nIf we have a complete structural equation model, we can assign\nprobabilities to counterfactuals, in light of observations. Let \\(\\bV\n= \\{X_1, X_2 ,\\ldots ,X_n\\}\\) be a set of endogenous variables, and\n\\(\\bU = \\{U_1, U_2 ,\\ldots ,U_n\\}\\) a set of exogenous variables. Our\nstructural equations have the form: \n\n\\[X_i = f_i (\\bPA(X_i), U_i)\\]\n\n\nWe have a probability distribution \\(\\Pr'\\) on \\(\\bU\\), which induces\na probability distribution P on \\(\\bU \\cup \\bV\\). Suppose that we\nobserve the value of some of the variables: \\(X_j = x_j\\) for all \\(j\n\\in \\bS \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots ,n\\}\\). We now want to assess the\ncounterfactual \u201cif \\(X_k\\) had been \\(x_k\\), then \\(X_l\\) would\nhave been \\(x_l\\)\u201d, where k and l may be in\n\\(\\bS\\) but need not be. We can evaluate the probability of this\ncounterfactual using this three-step process:\n\nUpdate the probability P by conditioning on the observations, to\nget a new probability distribution \\(\\Pr(\u2022 \\mid \\cap_{j \\in \\bS}\nX_j = x_j)\\). Call the restriction of this probability function to\n\\(\\bU\\) \\(\\Pr''\\).\nReplace the equation for \\(X_k\\) with \\(X_k = x_k\\).\nUse the distribution \\(\\Pr''\\) on \\(\\bU\\) together with the\nmodified set of equations to induce a new probability distribution P*\non \\(\\bV\\). \\(\\Pr^*( X_l = x_l)\\) is then the probability of the\ncounterfactual.\n\n\nThis procedure differs from the procedure for interventions (discussed\nin\n Section 4.7)\n in that steps 1 and 2 have been reversed. We first update the\nprobability distribution, then perform the intervention. This reflects\nthe fact that the observations tell us about the actual world, in\nwhich the intervention did not (necessarily) occur.\n\nIf we do not have a complete SEM, it is not generally possible to\nidentify the probability of a counterfactual, but only to set upper\nand lower bounds. For example, suppose that we believe that asbestos\nexposure causes lung cancer, so that we posit a simple DAG:\n\n\\[A \\rightarrow L.\\]\n\n\nSuppose also that we have data for people similar to Ted which yields\nthe following probabilities: \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid A = 1) & = .11,\\\\\n\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid A = 0) & = .06.\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n(We are oversimplifying, and treating asbestos and lung cancer as\nbinary variables.) We observe that Ted was in fact exposed to asbestos\nand did in fact develop lung cancer. What is the probability of the\ncounterfactual: \u201cIf Ted had not been exposed to asbestos, he\nwould not have developed lung cancer\u201d? Pearl (2009) calls a\nprobability of this form a probability of necessity. It is\noften called the probability of causation, although this\nterminology is misleading for reasons discussed by Greenland and\nRobins (1988). This quantity is often of interest in tort law. Suppose\nthat Ted sues his employer for damages related to his lung cancer. He\nwould have to persuade a jury that his exposure to asbestos caused his\nlung cancer. American civil law requires a \u201cmore probable than\nnot\u201d standard of proof, and it employs a \u201cbut for\u201d\nor counterfactual definition of causation. Hence Ted must convince the\njury that it is more probable than not that he would not have\ndeveloped lung cancer if he had not been exposed.\n\nWe may divide the members of the population into four categories,\ndepending upon which counterfactuals are true of them:\n\ndoomed individuals will develop lung cancer no matter\nwhat\nimmune individuals will avoid lung cancer no matter\nwhat\nsensitive individuals will develop lung cancer just in\ncase they are exposed to asbestos\nreverse sensitive individuals will develop lung cancer\njust in case they are not exposed to asbestos\n\n\nIt is easiest to think of the population as being divided into four\ncategories, with each person being one of these four types. However,\nwe do not need to assume that the process is deterministic; it may be\nthe case that each person only has a certain probability of falling\ninto one of these categories.\n\nMathematically, this is equivalent to the following. Let \\(U_L\\) be\nthe error variable for \\(L. U_L\\) takes values of the form \\((u_1,\nu_2)\\) with each \\(u_i\\) being 0 or 1. \\((1, 1)\\) corresponds to\ndoomed, \\((0, 0)\\) to immune, \\((1, 0)\\) to\nsensitive, and \\((0, 1)\\) to reverse. That is, the\nfirst element tells us what value L will take if an individual\nis exposed to asbestos, and the second element what value L\nwill take if an individual is not exposed. The equation for L\nwill be \\(L = (A \\times u_1) + ((1 - A) \\times u_2)\\).\n\nLet us assume that the distribution of the error variable \\(U_L\\) is\nindependent of asbestos exposure A. The observed probability of\nlung cancer is compatible with both of the following probability\ndistributions over our four counterfactual categories:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr_1(\\textit{doomed}) & = .06,  &\\Pr_2(\\textit{doomed}) &= 0,\\\\\n\\Pr_1(\\textit{immune}) & = .89,  &  \\Pr_2(\\textit{immune}) & = .83,\\\\\n\\Pr_1(\\textit{sensitive}) & = .05, & \\Pr_2(\\textit{sensitive}) & = .11, \\\\\n\\Pr_1(\\textit{reverse}) & = 0 & \\Pr_2(\\textit{reverse}) & = .06\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n \n\nMore generally, the observed probability is compatible with any\nprobability \\(\\Pr'\\) satisfying: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr'(\\textit{doomed}) + \\Pr'(\\textit{senstive}) & = \\Pr(L \\mid A) & = .11;\\\\\n\\Pr'(\\textit{immune}) + \\Pr'(\\textit{reverse}) & = \\Pr({\\sim}L \\mid A) &  = .89;\\\\\n\\Pr'(\\textit{doomed}) + \\Pr'(\\textit{reverse}) & = \\Pr(L \\mid {\\sim}A) & = .06;\\\\\n\\Pr'(\\textit{immune}) + \\Pr'(\\textit{senstive}) & = \\Pr({\\sim}L \\mid {\\sim}A) & = .94.\\\\\n \\end{aligned}\n    \\]\n\n\n\\(\\Pr_1\\) and \\(\\Pr_2\\) are just the most extreme cases. From the fact\nthat Ted was exposed to asbestos and developed lung cancer, we know\nthat he is either sensitive or doomed. The\ncounterfactual of interest will be true just in case he is\nsensitive. Hence the probability of the counterfactual, given\nthe available evidence, is P(sensitive | sensitive\nor doomed). However, using \\(\\Pr_1\\) yields a conditional\nprobability of .45 (5/11), while \\(\\Pr_2\\) yields a conditional\nprobability of 1. Given the information available to us, all we can\nconclude is that the probability of necessity is between .45 and 1. To\ndetermine the probability more precisely, we would need to know the\nprobability distribution of the error variable.\n\nA closely related counterfactual quantity is what Pearl (2009) calls\nthe probability of sufficiency. Suppose that Teresa, unlike\nTed, was not exposed to asbestos, and did not develop lung cancer. The\nprobability of sufficiency is the probability that she would\nhave suffered lung cancer if she had been exposed. That is,\nthe probability of sufficiency is the probability that if the cause\nwere added to a situation in which it and the effect was absent, it\nwould have resulted in the effect occurring. The probability of\nsufficiency is closely related to the quantity that Sheps (1958)\ncalled the relative difference, and that Cheng (1997) calls\nthe causal power. Cheng\u2019s terminology reflects the idea\nthat the probability of sufficiency of C for E is the\npower of C to bring about E in cases where E is\nabsent. As in the case of the probability of necessity, if one does\nnot have a complete structural equation model, but only a Causal Bayes\nNet or Semi-Markov Causal Model, it is usually only possible to put\nupper and lower bounds on the probability of sufficiency. Using the\nprobabilities from the previous example, the probability of\nsufficiency of asbestos for lung cancer would be between .05 (5/94)\nand .12 (11/94).\n\nDetermining the probabilities of counterfactuals, even just upper and\nlower bounds, is computationally demanding. Balke and Pearl\u2019s\ntwin network method (Balke and Pearl (1994a), (1994b); Pearl (2009,\npp. 213 - 215)) and Richardson and Robins\u2019 split-node method\n(Richardson and Robins (2016)) are two methods that have been proposed\nfor solving this kind of problem.\n5.

That\nentry contains in addition some discussion of the connection between\nprobabilistic causal models and earlier probabilistic theories of\ncausation.\n\nEberhardt 2017 is a short survey that provides a clear introduction to\nmany of the topics covered in\n Sections 4.2\n through 4.6, as well as Section\n 4.9. Spirtes and\nZhang 2016 is a longer and more technical overview that covers much of\nthe same ground. It has particularly good coverage on the issues\nraised in\n Section 4.5.\n\nThe entries on\n decision theory\n and\n causal decision theory\n present more detailed background information about some of the issues\nraised in\n Section 4.8.\n\nThis entry has focused on topics that are likely to be of most\ninterest to philosophers. There are a number of important technical\nissues that have been largely ignored. Many of these address problems\nthat arise when various simplifying assumptions made here (such as\nacyclicity, and knowledge of the true probabilities) are\nrejected. Some of these issues are briefly surveyed along with\nreferences in\n Supplement on Further Topics in Causal Inference.",
