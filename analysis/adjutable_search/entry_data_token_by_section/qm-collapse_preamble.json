    "main_text": "\n\nQuantum mechanics, with its revolutionary implications, has posed\ninnumerable problems to philosophers of science. In particular, it has\nsuggested reconsidering basic concepts such as the existence of a\nworld that is, at least to some extent, independent of the observer,\nthe possibility of getting reliable and objective knowledge about it,\nand the possibility of taking (under appropriate circumstances) at\nleast some properties to be objectively possessed by physical systems.\nIt has also raised many others questions which are well known to those\ninvolved in the debate on the interpretation of this pillar of modern\nscience. One can argue that most of the problems are not only due to\nthe intrinsic revolutionary nature of the phenomena which have led to\nthe development of the theory. They are also related to the fact that,\nin its standard formulation and interpretation, quantum mechanics is a\ntheory which is excellent (in fact it has an unprecedented success in\nthe history of science) in telling us everything about what we\nobserve, but it meets with serious difficulties in telling us\nwhat there is. We are making here specific reference to the\ncentral problem of the theory, usually referred to as the\nmeasurement problem, which is accompanying quantum theory since\nits birth. It is just one of the many attempts to overcome the\ndifficulties posed by this problem that has led to the development of\nCollapse Theories, i.e., to the Dynamical Reduction\nProgram (DRP). As we shall see, this approach consists in\naccepting that the dynamical equation of the standard theory should be\nmodified by the addition of stochastic and nonlinear terms. The nice\nfact is that the resulting theory is capable, on the basis of a single\ndynamics which is assumed to govern all natural processes, to account\nat the same time for all well-established facts about microscopic\nsystems as described by the standard theory, as well as for the\nso-called postulate of wave packet reduction (WPR), which accompanies\nthe interaction of a microscopic system with a measuring device. As is\nwell known, such a postulate is assumed in the standard scheme just in\norder to guarantee that measurements have outcomes but, as we\nshall discuss below, it meets with insurmountable difficulties if one\ntries to derive it by assuming the measurement itself to be a process\ngoverned by the linear laws of the theory. Finally, the collapse\ntheories account in a completely satisfactory way for the classical\nbehavior of macroscopic systems. \n\nTwo specifications are necessary in order to make clear from the\nbeginning what the limitations and the merits of the program are. The\nonly satisfactory explicit models of this type (the model proposed by\nGhirardi, Rimini, and Weber (1986), usually referred to as the GRW\ntheory, as well as all subsequent developments) are phenomenological\nattempts to solve a foundational problem. At present, they involve\nphenomenological parameters which, if the theory is taken seriously,\nacquire the status of new constants of nature. Moreover, the problem\nof building satisfactory relativistic generalizations of collapse\nmodels is very difficult, though some improvements have been made,\nwhich have elucidated some crucial points. \n\nIn spite of their phenomenological character, Collapse Theories are\nassuming a growing relevance, since they provide a clear resolution\nfor the difficulties of the formalism, to close the circle in\nthe precise sense defined by Abner Shimony (1989). Moreover, they have\nallowed a clear identification of the formal features which should\ncharacterize any unified theory of micro and macro processes. \n\nLast but not least, Collapse Theories qualify themselves as rival\ntheories of quantum mechanics and one can easily identify some of\ntheir physical implications which, in principle, would allow crucial\ntests discriminating between the two. Getting stringent indications\nfrom such tests requires experiments, whose technology has been\ndeveloped only very recently. Actually, it is just due to remarkable\nimprovements in the field of opto-mechanics and cold atoms, as well as\nnuclear physics, that specific bounds have already been obtained for\nthe parameters characterizing the theories under investigation; more\nimportant, precise families of physical processes in which a violation\nof the linear nature of the standard formalism might emerge have been\nclearly identified and are the subject of systematic investigations\nwhich might lead, in the end, to relevant discoveries.\n",
