    "main_text": "Race in Moral, Political and Legal Philosophy\n5. Race in Continental Philosophy\n\nWhile the debates in contemporary philosophy of race within the\nanalytic tradition have largely revolved around whether or not races\nexist along with criteria for determining realness or existence,\nphilosophers working in the Continental traditions have taken up the\nconcept of race along other dimensions (see Bernasconi and Cook 2003\nfor an overview). First, those working within the traditions of\nExistentialism and Phenomenology have called on Fanon, Merleau-Ponty,\nand Sartre, among others, to understand how race and functions within\nour lived, bodily experiences of everyday life. This strand of\nscholarship focuses on the materiality of race. As Emily S. Lee puts\nit, \u201cboth the social structural and the individual subconscious\nlevels of analysis rely on perceiving the embodiment of race\u201d\n(2014, 1). Second, philosophers building on the work of Michel\nFoucault have articulated genealogical understandings of race that\nfocus on its historical emergence as a concept and the ways that it\nhas functioned within discourses of knowledge and power.\n\nFrantz Fanon has been the primary influence for those understanding\nrace and racism within Existentialism and Phenomenology. In Black\nSkin, White Masks Fanon writes, \u201cI came into this world\nanxious to uncover the meaning of things, my soul desirous to be at\nthe origin of the world, and here I am an object among other\nobjects\u201d (2008/1952, 89). Furthermore, this \u201cinferiority\nis determined by the Other,\u201d by the \u201cwhite gaze\u201d\n(2008/1952, 90). Such a position is understood through the schema of\nthe body: \u201cIn a white world, the man of color encounters\ndifficulties in elaborating his body schema. The image of one\u2019s\nbody is solely negating. It\u2019s an image in the third\nperson\u201d (2008/1952, 90). Rather than being at home in his own\nbody, and moving \u201cout of habit,\u201d Fanon understands his\nbody as existing primarily as an object for others, requiring him to\nmove \u201cby implicit knowledge\u201d of the rules and norms of\nthat white world (2008/1952, 91).\n\nFanon critiques Sartre\u2019s understanding of race and racism by\npointing out that Sartre understands antiracism as a negative movement\nthat will be overcome (2008/1952, 111\u2013112). Sartre treats\nantiracism as the transition toward something else and not as an end\nin itself. Against this view Fanon writes, \u201c Sartre forgets that\nthe Black man suffers in his body quite differently from the white\nman\u201d (2008/1952, 117). He is trapped by his body schema,\n\u201ca toy in the hands of the white man\u201d (2008/1952,\n119).\n\nLewis Gordon draws on both Fanon and Sartre in articulating his\nAfricana existentialism. He distinguishes between Existentialism as a\nspecific historical European movement and philosophies of existence,\nor existential philosophies, which are preoccupied with\n\u201cfreedom, anguish, responsibility, embodied agency, sociality,\nand liberation.\u201d These concerns yield a focus on the\n\u201clived context of concern\u201d (2000, 10). For Gordon, due to\nthe history of racial oppression of Black peoples, an Africana\nexistential philosophy revolves around the questions, \u201cwhat does\nit mean to be a problem, and what is to be understood by Black\nsuffering?\u201d (2000, 8).\n\nAccording to Gordon, what is sometimes referred to as the \u201crace\nquestion\u201d is really a question about the status of Blackness,\nfor \u201crace has emerged, throughout its history, as the question\nfundamentally of \u2018the blacks\u2019 as it has for no other\ngroup\u201d (2000, 12). Rather than a denial that other groups have\nbeen racialized, the claim instead is that such other racializations\nhave been conditioned on a scale of European personhood to Black\nsubpersonhood (see also Mills 1998, 6\u201310). Blackness itself has\nbeen characterized as \u201cthe breakdown of reason\u201d and\n\u201can existential enigma\u201d in such a way that to ask after\nrace and racialization is to ask after Blackness in the first\ninstance.\n\nBoth Gordon and Zack use Sartre\u2019s notion of bad faith to\nunderstand race. We can understand bad faith as the evasion of\nresponsibility and fidelity to human freedom, and an understanding of\nthe human being as a for-itself. Bad faith falsely turns the human\nbeing into an object without agency, into an in-itself. For Gordon,\nantiblack racism conceives of Blackness itself as a problem so as to\navoid having to understand Black problems. As a result, actual Black\npeople disappear along with any responsibility to them (1997, 74).\nGordon gives the example of The Philadelphia Negro, Du\nBois\u2019 sociological study of the residents of\nPhiladelphia\u2019s Seventh Ward. Gordon recounts how those\ncommissioning the study set Du Bois up to fail so that he would only\nperpetuate the pathologizing of the Black population, presenting\nBlackness itself as a problem rather than attempt to understand the\nproblems of Black people and communities (2000, 69).\n\nWhereas Gordon uses bad faith to understand antiblack racism, Zack\ndoes so to deepen her eliminativism. For Sartre, authenticity is the\nantidote to bad faith \u2013 to live authentically is to understand\nand embrace human freedom rather than evade it. Zack\u2019s\neliminativism attributes bad faith to those who affirm that racial\ndesignations describe human beings when in fact they do not (1993,\n3\u20134). If racial identifications lack adequate support because\nraces do not exist, then identification as mixed race is also done in\nbad faith. Instead, Zack understands her position of\n\u201canti-race\u201d as true authenticity that looks to the future\nin the name of freedom and resistance to oppression in the name of\nracelessness (1993, 164).\n\nEmbodiment and visibility are central to these views. Gordon\nunderstands the body as \u201cour perspective in the world,\u201d\nwhich occurs along (at least) three matrices: seeing, being seen, and\nbeing conscious of being seen (1997, 71). In an antiblack world this\nmeans that the Black body is a form of absence, going unseen in the\nsame manner as Ralph Ellison\u2019s protagonist in Invisible\nMan (1997, 72\u20133). George Yancy tells us that he writes from\nhis \u201clived embodied experience,\u201d which is a \u201csite of\nexposure\u201d (2008, 65). Black embodiment here is the lens used to\ncritique whiteness and its normative gaze. For Yancy, Black resistance\nitself decodes and recodes Black embodied existence, affirming the\nvalue of the Black body in the face of centuries of white denial\n(2008, 112\u20133).\n\nLinda Mart\u00edn Alcoff offers a phenomenological account of race\nthat highlights a \u201cvisual registry,\u201d which is socially and\nhistorically constructed and that is \u201cdeterminant over\nindividual experience\u201d (2006, 194). Like Yancy, Alcoff locates\nrace in embodied lived experience. Drawing on Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s work, Alcoff notes how the way that our\nperceptual practices are organized affects the way we come to know the\nworld (2006, 188). When race operates through visibility, these ways\nof normalized perceptual knowing become racialized. As she notes,\n\u201cracial consciousness works through learned practices and habits\nof visual discrimination and visual marks on the body\u2026race\nexists there on the body itself\u201d (2006, 196).\n\nLee argues that racial meaning fits squarely within the space that a\nphenomenological framework seeks to explore, namely, the space between\nthe natural and the cultural, the objective and the subjective, and\nthinking and nonthinking (Lee 2014, 8). Furthermore, a\nphenomenological approach can illuminate how, even when race is\nunderstood as a social construction, it can nonetheless become\nnaturalized through \u201cthe sedimentation of racial meaning into\nthe very structures and practices of society\u201d (Lee 2019,\nxi).\n\nA second line of thought runs through the work of Michel Foucault. In\nhis 1975\u20131976 lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France,\npublished as Society Must Be Defended, Foucault details the\nemergence of a discourse on race beginning in early 17th Century\nEngland. According to Foucault, race war discourse emerges through\nclaims of illegitimacy against the Stuart monarchy. These claims were\ncouched in the language of injustice as well as foreign invasion, in\nwhich an indigenous race is pitted against in invading outsider (2003,\n60). Race, at this point, is not a biological concept, instead\nreferring to lineage, custom, and tradition (2003, 77). Only later\ndoes this cultural notion of race transform into the scientific notion\nof race.\n\nCornel West employs a Foucaultian methodology to produce a genealogy\nof modern racism (1982). West analyzes how the discourse of modernity\ncame into being to show how central white supremacy is to its\npractices of knowledge and meaning making (47). By modern discourse he\nmeans, \u201cThe controlling metaphors, notions, categories, and\nnorms that shape the predominant conception of truth and knowledge in\nthe modern West,\u201d which are driven by the scientific revolution,\nthe Cartesian transformation of philosophy, and the classical revival\n(50). It is a discourse comprising certain forms of rationality,\nscientificity, objectivity, and aesthetic and cultural ideals, the\nparameters of which exclude Black equality from the outset, marking it\nas unintelligible and illegitimate within the prevailing norms of\ndiscourse and knowledge (47\u201348). Notions of truth and knowledge\nproduced by these three forces are governed by a value-free subject\nthat observes, compares, orders, and measures in order to obtain\nevidence and make inferences that verify the true representations of\nreality.\n\nLadelle McWhorter uses Foucault\u2019s lectures to conduct a\ngenealogy of racism and sexual oppression of a more proximate time and\nplace. According to McWhorter, \u201cracism in twentieth-century\nAnglo-America [has] to be understood in light of Foucault\u2019s work\non normalization,\u201d where racism exists as a crusade against\ndeviance, abnormality, and pathology (2009, 12). Building on\nFoucault\u2019s analysis of race war discourse McWhorter carries out\na genealogy of race, ultimately arguing that race and sexuality\n\u201care historically codependent and mutually determinative\u201d\n(2009, 14). Anglo-American discourse on race is therefore linked to\ndiscourses on eugenics, the family, sexual predation, normality, and\npopulation management, all of which function within the networks of\npower that Foucault referred to biopower (2009, 15). Ann Laura Stoler\n(1995) offers an extended reconstruction and critique of\nFoucault\u2019s treatment of race in light of colonialism and empire.\nJoy James goes even further, arguing that Foucault is not useful for\nthinking about race at all (1996, chapter 1).\n",
