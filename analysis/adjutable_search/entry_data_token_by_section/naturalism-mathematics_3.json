    "main_text": "Recent History of Methodological Naturalism || Present context\n2.2 Present context\n\n\nThe past couple of decades have seen a great surge of interest in\nnaturalism. 1997 was an important year in recent philosophy of\nmathematics, as it saw the publication of four books articulating the\npositions of five leading philosophers of mathematics: John Burgess\nand Gideon Rosen's A Subject with No Object, Penelope\nMaddy's Naturalism in Mathematics, Michael\nResnik's Mathematics as the Science of Patterns, and Stewart\nShapiro's Philosophy of Mathematics.  All four books are to\nvarious degrees and amongst other things naturalistic: the first two\nare naturalist manifestos, the third advocates a Quinean scientific\nnaturalism, and the last, though mainly concerned with other matters,\nis sympathetic to naturalism. John Burgess's naturalism, first set out\nin his (1983) and in the past few years elaborated with his colleague\nGideon Rosen (1997, 2005), is perhaps most naturally construed as a\nversion of mathematical-cum-scientific naturalism (1997,\n211). Penelope Maddy's naturalism is a heterogeneous form of\nnaturalism which distinguishes between mathematics proper and the\nphilosophy of mathematics, embracing mathematical naturalism about the\nformer and scientific naturalism about the latter (section 5). Another\nposition suggested by Maddy (1997) is a thoroughgoing mathematical\nnaturalism that takes mathematical standards as authoritative within\nboth mathematics and its philosophy.\n\n\nIgnoring qualifications, the main contemporary versions of\nnaturalism, with their representative advocates, may be tabulated as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\nMathematics Proper\nPhilosophy ofMathematics\n\n\nScientific(Quine)\nScientific\nScientific\n\n\nMathematical-Cum-Scientific(Burgess)\nMathematical-cum-Scientific\nMathematical-cum-Scientific\n\n\nMathematical(?)\nMathematical\nMathematical\n\n\nHeterogeneous(Maddy 1997)\nMathematical\nScientific\n\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate the difference between statements in mathematics proper\nand the philosophy of mathematics, consider as an example of the\nformer the Green-Tao theorem, proved in 2004, which states that the\nsequence of prime numbers contains arbitrarily long arithmetic\nprogressions (but of course no infinitely long one); as examples of\nthe latter take the platonist claim that the number two exists and is\nabstract or the claim that because mathematical entities are created\nrather than discovered, impredicative definitions are not permissible.\nFor any given philosopher, the Green-Tao theorem and its proof are to\nbe assessed by the standards of the first column. For example, Quine\naccepts the theorem if and only if it is part of the best\nsystematisation of science (which it is assuming that the principles\nfrom which it is deduced and the logic by which it is deduced from those principles are). Similarly, for any given\nphilosopher, platonism and the stricture regarding impredicativity are\nto be assessed by the standards of the second column. For example,\nQuine accepts platonism because he takes it to be the scientifically\nsanctioned interpretation of mathematics: in his view, the mathematics\ncontained in the best systematisation of science is\nplatonic.\n\n\nThere are no clear exemplars of the view that mathematical standards\nshould be authoritative in philosophy of mathematics, hence the\nquestion mark. David Lewis flirted with this position in his monograph\non set theory (1991, viii\u2013ix, 54), but by the time of his (1993)\nhad already repudiated it. The position is suggested by remarks in\nMaddy (1997), though as we will see in section 5, Maddy (1997) is more\nnaturally interpreted as advancing a heterogeneous form of\nnaturalism. Several other philosophers of mathematics are also\nprofessed naturalists, notably Alan Baker (2001) and Mark Colyvan\n(2001).\n",
