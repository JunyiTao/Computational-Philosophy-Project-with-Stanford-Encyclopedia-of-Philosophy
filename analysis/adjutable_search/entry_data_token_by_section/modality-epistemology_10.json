    "main_text": "Induction and Abduction\n8. Modalism and Normativism\n\nSome authors have recently tried to solve the Integration and the\nReliability Challenge by rejecting well-established views in modal\nmetaphysics.\n\nOt\u00e1vio Bueno and Scott Shalkowski (2015) adopt\nmodalism about modality. They maintain that there is no\nreductive analysis of modality in terms of non-modal facts or\nproperties. For arguably one cannot reduce the truth of \u201cIt is\npossible that \\(P\\)\u201d to \u201cIt is true in some world, \\(w\\),\nthat \\(P\\)\u201d without wondering whether or not \\(w\\) itself is\npossible or impossible. The epistemological task for Bueno and\nShalkowski is thus to provide an account of how we come to know modal\ntruths while accepting a primitivist view of modality. In this way,\nBueno and Shalkowski aim to meet the Integration Challenge.\n\nBueno and Shalkowski describe their account of our knowledge of\nnon-actual possibilities as follows:\n\n\nOn our account, what grounds modal knowledge is ultimately our\nknowledge of the relevant modal properties of the objects under\nconsideration. \u2026 Suppose we are trying to determine whether we\nknow that the table Hemingway used to write on in his Key West house\nwould have broken had a 26,000-pound giant African bull elephant sat\non it. \u2026On our account, we know that it would have broken\nsimply by knowing the properties that such an elephant has and the\nproperties the table has, modal in character as they already are.\n(2015: 680).\n\n\nThe core idea is that in many cases we arrive at modal knowledge by\ninvestigating the relevant properties and objects in question rather\nthan turning to some special epistemic capacity, such as being\nconceivable. For example, one can know that it is possible for an\nunbroken table to break because it is breakable. How do we come to\nknow this piece of ordinary modal knowledge? We do so on the basis of\nour knowledge of wood, chemical bonds, and the physical relations the\ntable can find itself in, such as having a giant bull elephant sit on\nit.\n\nAmie Thomasson (2021) contends that we should reject a widespread\ndescriptivist picture of modality. According to\ndescriptivism, the primary function of modal discourse is to track and\ndescribe modal facts and properties, which supposedly exist\nindependently of our expressive capacities and make true our modal\nstatements. Instead, according to Thomasson\u2019s Modal\nNormativism (MN), modal discourse is distinctively\nnormative, in that it\n\n\nserves the function of expressing, teaching, conveying, or (re-)\nnegotiating semantic rules (or their consequences) in particularly\nadvantageous ways. (2021: S2087)\n\n\nPossibility and necessity are thus to be explained by reference to\nsemantic rules, not to some mind-independent modal reality. For\nexample, according to Thomasson, the fact that necessarily, all\nbachelors are unmarried shouldn\u2019t be explained in terms of\nsome modal fact involving male humans that are bachelors; but rather\nin terms of the rules for correct application of the terms\n\u2018bachelor\u2019 and \u2018unmarried\u2019; particularly, the\nrule that \u201cOne may only apply \u2018bachelor\u2019 where\n\u2018unmarried\u2019 may be applied\u201d. Once (MN) is in place,\nfor Thomasson we can then explain modal knowledge in a straightforward\nway. Speakers who can use the semantic rules correctly show\nimplicit modal knowledge. Whereas, speakers have\nexplicit modal knowledge when they develop the ability to\nexplicitly convey in the object language and indicative mood the\nsemantic rules: in our example, when they are able to express:\n\u201cNecessarily, all bachelors are unmarried\u201d. Importantly,\nfor Thomasson, we can still talk about modal truth. From the sentence\n\u201cNecessarily, all bachelors are unmarried\u201d we can infer\n\u201c\u2018Necessarily, all bachelors are unmarried\u2019 is\ntrue\u201d by applying the (deflationist) equivalence schema\n\u201c\\(\\langle p \\rangle\\) is true iff \\(p\\)\u201d (see Thomasson\n2021).\nCritical Questions for Modalism and Normativism\n\nThe Completeness Question: On Bueno and\nShalkowski\u2019s view we arrive at knowledge of modal propositions\nthrough knowledge of modal properties. But how do we gain knowledge of\nmodal properties in the first place? For Bueno and Shalkowski\nproperties are understood in a deflationary way, that is, they are not\ncharacterized in terms of universals or abstract entities. They are\nsimply traits of objects. We know that the vase is fragile because it\nis made out of glass and glass can be broken if struck. But\nknowledge of the fact that glass can be broken is itself modal\nknowledge. Hence, some knowledge of modal properties is yet\nto be accounted for.\n\nThe Scope Question and its Consequences: One might\nquestion whether Thomasson\u2019s Modal Normativism succeeds in\nexplaining knowledge of metaphysical modality, particularly\nas opposed to conceptual modality or epistemic\nanalyticity. Arguably, mastering the semantic rules determining\nthe actual application conditions of, say, \u201cwater\u201d, and\npossessing the relevant empirical information, won\u2019t suffice to\nsettle whether it is metaphysically possible for water to be XYZ or\ncontain carbon. As a consequence, because of its sole focus on\nsemantic rules, Modal Normativism might imply that classical\nmetaphysical debates in philosophy are merely a matter of verbal\ndisagreement and negotiation. While it is not clear whether this\nconstitutes a problem, in the eyes of the modal normativist, it does\nraise an important point of disagreement. For example, are\nparticipants in the debate on the mind-body problem really discussing\nthe nature of consciousness in relation to the physical body or are\nthey just renegotiating our rules for \u201cmind\u201d,\n\u201cbody\u201d, and \u201cconscious\u201d etc.? For some the\nmind-body problem is not about the words \u201cmind\u201d and\n\u201cbody\u201d but about minds and bodies (for discussion, see\nMallozzi forthcoming b).\n",
