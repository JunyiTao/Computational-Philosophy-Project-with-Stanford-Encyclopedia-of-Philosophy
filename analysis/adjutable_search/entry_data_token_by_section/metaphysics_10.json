    "main_text": "The Methodology of Metaphysics\n4. The Methodology of Metaphysics\n\nAs is obvious from the discussion in\n Section 3,\n the scope of metaphysics has expanded beyond the tidy boundaries\nAristotle drew. So how should we answer our original question? Is\ncontemporary metaphysics just a compendium of philosophical problems\nthat cannot be assigned to epistemology or logic or ethics or\naesthetics or to any of the parts of philosophy that have relatively\nclear definitions? Or is there a common theme that unites work on\nthese disparate problems and distinguishes contemporary metaphysics\nfrom other areas of inquiry?\n\nThese issues concerning the nature of metaphysics are further\nconnected with issues about the epistemic status of various\nmetaphysical theories. Aristotle and most of the Medievals took it for\ngranted that, at least in its most fundamental aspects, the ordinary\nperson\u2019s picture of the world is \u201ccorrect as far as it\ngoes\u201d. But many post-Medieval metaphysicians have refused to\ntake this for granted. Some of them, in fact, have been willing to\ndefend the thesis that the world is very different from, perhaps\nradically different from, the way people thought it was before they\nbegan to reason philosophically. For example, in response to the\npuzzles of coincidence considered in\n Section 3.3,\n some metaphysicians have maintained that there are no objects with\nproper parts. This entails that composite objects\u2014tables,\nchairs, cats, and so on\u2014do not exist, a somewhat startling view.\nAnd as we saw in\n Section 3.1,\n other metaphysicians have been happy to postulate the reality of\nconcrete merely possible worlds if this posit makes for a simpler and\nmore explanatorily powerful theory of modality. Perhaps this\ncontemporary openness to \u201crevisionary\u201d metaphysics is\nsimply a recovery of or a reversion to a pre-Aristotelian conception\nof a \u201cpermissible metaphysical conclusion\u201d, a conception\nthat is illustrated by Zeno\u2019s arguments against the reality of\nmotion and Plato\u2019s Allegory of the Cave. But no matter how we\nclassify it, the surprising nature of many contemporary metaphysical\nclaims puts additional pressure on practioners to explain just what\nthey are up to. They raise questions of the methodology of\nmetaphysics.\n\nOne attractive strategy for answering these questions emphasizes the\ncontinuity of metaphysics with science. On this conception,\nmetaphysics is primarily or exclusively concerned with developing\ngeneralizations from our best-confirmed scientific theories. For\nexample, in the mid-twentieth century, Quine (1948) proposed that that\nthe \u201cold/intermediate\u201d metaphysical debate over the status\nof abstract objects should be settled in this way. He observed that if\nour best scientific theories are recast in the \u201ccanonical\nnotation of (first-order) quantification\u201d (in sufficient depth\nthat all the inferences that users of these theories will want to make\nare valid in first-order logic), then many of these theories, if not\nall of them, will have as a logical consequence the existential\ngeneralization on a predicate \\(F\\) such that \\(F\\) is satisfied only\nby abstract objects. It would seem, therefore, that our best\nscientific theories \u201ccarry ontological commitment\u201d to\nobjects whose existence is denied by nominalism. (These objects may\nnot be universals in the classical sense. They may, for example, be\nsets.) Take for example the simple theory, \u2018There are\nhomogeneous objects, and the mass of a homogeneous object in grams is\nthe product of its density in grams per cubic centimeter and its\nvolume in cubic centimeters\u2019. A typical recasting of this theory\nin the canonical notation of quantification is:\n\n\\(\\exists Hx\\) & \\(\\forall x(Hx \\rightarrow Mx = Dx \\times Vx)\\)\n\n\n(\u2018\\(Hx\\)\u2019: \u2018\\(x\\) is homogeneous\u2019;\n\u2018\\(Mx\\)\u2019: \u2018the mass of \\(x\\) in grams\u2019;\n\u2018\\(Dx\\)\u2019: \u2018the density of \\(x\\) in grams per cubic\ncentimeter\u2019; \u2018\\(Vx\\)\u2019: \u2018the volume of \\(x\\) in\ncubic centimeters\u2019.) A first-order logical consequence of this\n\u201ctheory\u201d is\n\n\\(\\exists x\\exists y\\exists z(x = y \\times z)\\)\n\n\nThat is: there exists at least one thing that is a product (at least\none thing that, for some \\(x\\) and some \\(y\\) is the product of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\)). And a product must be a number, for the operation\n\u201cproduct of\u201d applies only to numbers. Our little theory,\nat least if it is recast in the way shown above, is therefore, in a\nvery obvious sense, \u201ccommitted\u201d to the existence of\nnumbers. It would seem, therefore, that a nominalist cannot\nconsistently affirm that theory. (In this example, the role played by\n\u2018the predicate F\u2019 in the abstract statement of\nQuine\u2019s \u201cobservation\u201d is played by the predicate\n\u2018\u2026=\u2026\u00d7\u2026\u2019.)\n\nQuine\u2019s work on nominalism inspired a much broader program for\napproaching ontological questions. According to\n\u201cneo-Quineans\u201d, questions about the existence of abstract\nobjects, mental events, objects with proper parts, temporal parts, and\neven other concrete possible worlds are united to the extent that they\nare questions about the ontological machinery required to account for\nthe truth of our best-confirmed theories. Still, many questions of the\nnew and old metaphysics are not questions of ontology. For example,\nmany participants in the debate over causation are not particularly\nworried about whether causes and effects exist. Rather, they want to\nknow \u201cin virtue of what\u201d something is a cause or effect.\nFew involved in the debate over the mental and physical are interested\nin the question whether there are mental properties (in some sense or\nother). Rather, they are interested in whether mental properties are\n\u201cbasic\u201d or sui generis\u2014or whether they are\ngrounded, partially or fully, in physical properties.\n\nIs there a unified methodology for metaphysics more broadly\nunderstood? Some think the task of the metaphysician is to identify\nand argue for explanatory relations of various kinds. According to\nFine (2001), metaphysicians are in the business of providing theories\nof which facts or propositions ground other facts or propositions, and\nwhich facts or propositions hold \u201cin reality\u201d. For\nexample, a philosopher might hold that tables and other composite\nobjects exist, but think that facts about tables are completely\ngrounded in facts about the arrangements of point particles or facts\nabout the state of a wave function. This metaphysician would hold that\nthere are no facts about tables \u201cin reality\u201d; rather,\nthere are facts about arrangements of particles. Schaffer 2010\nproposes a similar view, but holds that metaphysical grounding\nrelations hold not between facts but between entities. According to\nSchaffer, the fundamental entity/entities should be understood as the\nentity/entities that grounds/ground all others. On Schaffer\u2019s\nconception we can meaningfully ask whether a table is grounded in its\nparts or vice versa. We can even theorize (as Schaffer does) that the\nworld as a whole is the ultimate ground for everything.\n\nAnother noteworthy approach (Sider 2012) holds that the task of the\nmetaphysician is to \u201cexplain the world\u201d in terms of its\nfundamental structure. For Sider, what unites (good) metaphysics as a\ndiscipline is that its theories are all framed in terms that pick out\nthe fundamental structure of the world. For example, according to\nSider we may understand \u2018causal nihilism\u2019 as the view that\ncausal relations do not feature in the fundamental structure of the\nworld, and so the best language for describing the world will eschew\ncausal predicates.\n\nIt should be emphasized that these ways of delimiting metaphysics do\nnot presuppose that all of the topics we\u2019ve considered as\nexamples of metaphysics are substantive or important to the subject.\nConsider the debate about modality. Quine (1953) and Sider (2012) both\nargue from their respective theories about the nature of metaphysics\nthat aspects of the debate over the correct metaphysical theory of\nmodality are misguided. Others are skeptical of the debates about\ncomposition or persistence through time. So theories about the nature\nof metaphysics might give us new resources for criticizing particular\nfirst-order debates that have historically been considered\nmetaphysical, and it is common practice for metaphysicians to regard\nsome debates as substantive while adopting a deflationist attitude\nabout others.\n",
