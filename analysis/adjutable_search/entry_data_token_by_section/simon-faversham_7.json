    "main_text": "Psychology || Intellection as Abstraction and Apprehension\n4.3 Intellection as Abstraction and Apprehension\n\nIntellection is the proper operation of an intellect that comprises\nboth a passive and an active capacity. Hence, the psychological\nmechanisms of intellection include the abstraction performed by the\nagent intellect and the apprehension produced in the possible\nintellect (In De an.: q.16).\n\nThe primary object of intellection is a quiddity presented to the\nintellect in the form of an intelligible species (In De an.:\nq.10). Since forms are material and particular in both external things\nand sensory representations (phantasmata), and since the\nintelligible object must be immaterial and universal, the intellect\nmust produce an immaterial object to represent those forms under the\naspect of universality\u2014the intelligible species. The intellect\ndoes this through the act of abstraction performed by its active\ncapacity, the agent intellect (In De an.: q.12).\n\nThe agent intellect endows the quiddity with intelligibility: through\nits act of abstraction it makes universal and immaterial the material\nand particular quiddity in the sensory representation (In De\nan.: q.12 and q.16). Simon, however, wavers between different\ndescriptions of the act of abstraction. On one hand, he describes it\nas similar to the act of illumination, so that just as light enables\nthe eye to see and the visible object to be seen, so the agent\nintellect enables the possible intellect to think and the quiddity in\nthe sensory representation to be thought (In De an.: q.12).\nConsequently, he seems to consider intellection as similar to the act\nof vision. Nonetheless, the similarity is not complete, because the\nvisible object is visible in itself, whereas the quiddity in the\nsensory representation must be made intelligible by the agent\nintellect. On the other hand, Simon describes the act of abstraction\nas the extraction of an intelligible species from the sensory\nrepresentation, a species that is \u2018re-positioned\u2019 in the\npossible intellect, thus actualizing its act of apprehension (In\nDe an.: q.16). Later commentators would reject one or the other\nmodel of abstraction depending on the extent of their realism about\nessences. Thus, the Averroist master John of Jandun rejects the\nillumination model because there is no way for something that exists\nin a bodily organ to be made universal, whether by illumination or\notherwise, while remaining in that organ. Radulphus Brito, however,\nrejects the \u2018re-positioning\u2019 model because it fails to\nexplain the transfer of a form from the material to the immaterial\nrealm. Simon, it seems, is again unaware of the conflicts each model\nfaces, as well as of the difficulties that would arise from holding\nboth.\n",
