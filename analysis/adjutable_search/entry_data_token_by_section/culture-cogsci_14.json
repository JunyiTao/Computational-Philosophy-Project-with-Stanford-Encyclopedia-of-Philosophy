Henrich, Blasi, et al. forthcoming),\nhas also attracted the attention of epistemologists (Machery, Stich,\net al. 2017; Mizumoto et al. 2018; also see Figueroa & Harding\n2003, especially Wylie 2003; Feest & Sturm 2011). Western\nepistemology has traditionally focused on questions about what it is\nfor individuals to have knowledge, but the last several decades have\nseen a growing interest in socially-oriented approaches to epistemic\nphenomena and to knowers themselves. These social approaches, in turn,\nare better positioned to capture and account for the ways in which\naspects of culture are epistemologically significant (Carter, Clark et\nal. 2018a; Grasswick 2006 [2018]; Goldman & O\u2019Connor 2019\n[2021]).\n\nFor example, this social turn in epistemology has sparked research\ninto cognitive mechanisms for epistemic vigilance, especially those\nthat monitor and regulate communication (Sperber, Cl\u00e9ment, et\nal. 2010; Mercier 2020). It has also directed attention towards many\ndifferent aspects of epistemic norms, those informal rules of conduct\nthat regulate how people handle information, assess evidence of\nvarious kinds, make public assertions (Kneer 2021), etc. Epistemic\nnorms also underpin social trust, prescribing how one ought to assign\ncredence to testimony given by people who bear different social\nidentities, belong to different groups, and are associated with\ndifferent institutions and forms of expertise (Lackey 2008; Goldberg\n2010; Littlejohn & Turri 2014; Henderson 2020). An especially\nfruitful strand of this research has examined variation in such norms,\nand in the ways in which they can be unfair to members of marginalized\ncultural groups, and thus contribute to a myriad of forms of epistemic\ninjustice (Fricker 2007; Medina 2013; Dotson 2014). Other research at\nthe intersection of social epistemology and political philosophy\n(Edenberg & Hannon 2021) has looked at the way certain\nconfigurations of epistemic norms, together with the operation of\nselective learning heuristics like the my-side bias and tribal social\ninstincts mentioned in\n Section 3.3,\n can create filter bubbles and echo chambers (E. Anderson 2021; Nguyen\n2020), contribute to the spread of misinformation (O\u2019Connor\n& Weatherall 2019), and sustain extreme forms of polarization and\npartisanship (Rini 2017, also see Raymond, Kelly, & Hennes\nforthcoming). Work on the character of scientific inquiry has also\nlooked at the role of epistemic norms in the production of knowledge\nby scientific communities (Kuhn 1962; Barnes et al. 1996; Vaesen\n2021), including norms that specify what counts as acceptable evidence\n(Longino 1990) and norms that prescribe that empirical evidence be\naccorded a unique significance in the construction and evaluation of\nscientific argumentation (Strevens 2020).\n\nAnother strand in this research examines familiar tensions between\nindividual and collective levels of analysis as they emerge in\nepistemological contexts. For example, psychological tendencies that\nlook like biases or failures of rationality from the point of view of\nindividual reasoning may be the very same tendencies that, when widely\nshared, allow for the accumulation over time of group beneficial\ncultural traits and adaptive wherewithal. The tendency of humans to\nover-imitate, for example, may lead them to occasionally expend extra\ntime and energy mimicking unnecessary steps in a sequence of\nbehaviors. Considered individually, episodes of copying \u201ctoo\nmuch\u201d can look like a mistake, and the underlying propensity\nlike a source of irrationality and inefficiency. From a collective\nperspective, however, such a tendency, distributed across members of\nthe population, may be a key factor in the group\u2019s ability to\ncreate, sustain, and faithfully transmit cumulative culture and\nknowledge over the span of generations (Hoehl et al. 2019, also see J.\nHenrich 2016). Similarly, others have argued that what look like\nreasoning mistakes when examined in isolation are driven by heuristics\nlike a my-side bias that make important contributions to a\ngroup\u2019s ability reap the benefits of dividing cognitive labor\n(Mercier & Sperber 2011, 2017; also see Peters forthcoming on\nconfirmation bias). A similar perspective has been used to recast\nquestions about epistemic accountability, suggesting that while many\n\u2018biases\u2019 may facilitate collective reasoning and the group\nlevel production of knowledge, individuals who employ those biases\nfail to qualify as epistemically virtuous. Those individuals, that is,\ndo not deserve any epistemic credit for the knowledge their biases\nhelp produce (N. Levy & Alfano 2020; also see Palermos 2016 and\nAlfano 2021; cf. Rini 2017 for an argument that inverts the\nevaluation, holding that in some contexts partisanship in acceptance\nof testimony can be individually virtuous but lead to epistemic\noutcomes\u2014like the widespread circulation of fake news\u2014that\nare clearly vicious at collective levels).\n",
