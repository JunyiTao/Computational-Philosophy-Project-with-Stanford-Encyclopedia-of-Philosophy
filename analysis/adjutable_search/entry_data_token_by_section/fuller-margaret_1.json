    "main_text": "Major Themes in Fuller\u2019s Philosophy || Unitarianism and the Cultivation of the Self\n2.1 Unitarianism and the Cultivation of the Self\n\nCentral to both Margaret Fuller\u2019s theory and practice of life\nwas the cultivation of the self. The practice of\n\u201cself-improvement\u201d or \u201cself-culture\u201d was very\nwidespread among middle-class white Americans of the time. Even\nworking-class men like Abraham Lincoln labored for self-improvement in\ntheir individual character and talents as a pathway to security and\nprosperity. Conscious development of one\u2019s own integrity and\nabilities was regarded as a personal application of America\u2019s\nproud white male democracy. The most admired and sophisticated\nexponent of self-culture was the famous clergyman of the recently\nemerged Unitarian religious denomination, William Ellery Channing\n(1780\u20131842). Channing pioneered a form of Christian humanism.\nFuller regarded him as a heroic exemplar of her own ideal of\nself-culture. Channing\u2019s project included both genders and all\nraces of human beings (Fuller 1845: 60).\n\nMargaret Fuller was raised a Unitarian. The denomination originated in\nearly nineteenth-century New England in an intellectual rebellion by\ndescendants of the Puritans against Calvinist theology. The name\n\u201cUnitarian\u201d reflected their repudiation of the\nconventional Trinitarian Christian doctrine of a triune God of Father,\nSon, and Holy Spirit. The New England Unitarians ceased to regard\nJesus Christ as a unique divine personification of the Godhead.\nInstead, they emphasized the potential divinity in everyone: every\ngood person should seek to create their own Christlike, even Godlike,\ncharacter. As Channing explained in his sermon entitled\n\u201cLikeness to God\u201d: \u201cGod becomes a real being to us\nin proportion as his own nature is unfolded within us\u201d (D. Howe\n1970: 120; citing Channing 1828, in Works, III, 229).\n\nMargaret Fuller\u2019s personal quest for own self-realization as\nwell as her ardent feminist program for the self-realization of all\nwomen both took inspiration from Channing. Even though she abandoned\nthe Unitarian church and stopped attending any religious services,\nFuller never lost her admiration for Channing. Fuller set forth her\nmature religious principles in \u201cA Credo\u201d around June 1840\n(preserved in the Margaret Fuller Ossoli Collection, especially pp.\n97\u201398, in the Boston Public Library). \n\nFuller, Channing and many other American intellectuals of their time\nbased their conception of self-improvement on the faculty psychology\nof the Scottish moral philosophers Thomas Reid, Lord Kames, and Dugald\nStewart. The word \u201cfaculty\u201d, like the word\n\u201cfacility\u201d, is derived from the Latin word for\n\u201cpower\u201d, and faculty psychology throughout ancient,\nmedieval, and modern times has been the study of human powers. The\nconventional vision of human nature in Fuller\u2019s day was\nhierarchical, with reason being rightly superior to the emotions.\nConscience was considered a rational power. Channing Unitarians\nendorsed metaphysical dualism and sought to subordinate matter to mind\nin the process of self-culture. A key issue for self-improvement was\nsubordinating \u201cthe passions\u201d (including selfish, mercenary\nmotives) to reason, the divine quality in human nature. This version\nof Christian humanism took academic shape in the moral philosophy\ntaught at Harvard during Fuller\u2019s lifetime (D. Howe 1988,\nespecially chap. 2, \u201cThe Moral Nature of Man\u201d). Margaret\nFuller became the first woman granted library privileges at what was\nthen an all-male university.\n",
