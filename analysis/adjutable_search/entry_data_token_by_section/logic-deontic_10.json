    "main_text": "Conditional Obligations and Chisholm\u2019s Puzzle || Two Types of Detachment and Two Ways of Enriching SDL\n4.2 Two Types of Detachment and Two Ways of Enriching SDL\n\nIf von Wright launched deontic logic as an academic area of research,\nChisholm\u2019s paradox, and similar cases, were the booster rocket\nthat provided the escape velocity deontic logic needed from\n subsumption\n under normal modal logics, thus solidifying deontic logic\u2019s\nstatus as a distinct branch of\n logic.[44]\n It is now virtually universally acknowledged that Chisholm was right:\nthe sort of conditional deontic claim expressed in (3) can\u2019t be\nfaithfully represented in SDL, nor more generally by a composite of\nsome sort of unary deontic operator and material conditional.\nThe views diverge however where it comes to exactly what should be\nadded to SDL in order to represent conditional obligations. This\ndivergence in turn relates to a distinction between two types of\ndetachment in deontic\n reasoning.[45]\n\nLet \u201c\\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\)\u201d be shorthand for a conditional\nobligation or ought statement like that in the natural language\nsentence, (3), above. So we will read \\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\) as \u201cif\n\\(p\\), then it ought to be (or it is obligatory) that \\(q\\)\u201d.\nSuppose we also assume that monadic obligations are disguised dyadic\nobligations, per the following analysis: \n\n\\[ \\OB p \\eqdf \\OB (p\\mid \\top). \\]\n\n\nThis analysis has been widely\n employed.[46]\n\nWith this in mind, we distinguish between two relevant types\nof\u201cdetachment principles\u201d (Greenspan 1975) that we might\nascribe to these iffy-\u2018ought\u2019s:\n\n\nFactual Detachment (FD): \\(p \\amp \\OB (q\\mid p) \\vdash\n\\OB q\\)\nDeontic Detachment (DD): \\(\\OB p \\amp \\OB (q\\mid p)\n\\vdash \\OB\n q\\).[47]\n\n\n\nFactual detachment tells us that from \\(p\\), and a deontic\nconditional to the effect that if \\(p\\) then it ought to be that\n\\(q\\), we can conclude that it ought to be that \\(q\\). Deontic\nDetachment in contrast tells us that from it ought to be that\n\\(p\\) and if \\(p\\), then it ought to be that \\(q\\), we can conclude\nthat it ought to be that \\(q\\). If we interpret a deontic conditional\nas a material conditional with an obligatory consequent (as in\n(3\u2032) above), FD, but not DD is supported. Conversely, if we\ninterpret deontic conditionals as obligatory material conditionals (as\nin (2\u2032) above), DD, but not FD is supported. Although we have\nshown earlier that neither of these interpretations is acceptable, the\ncontrast reveals a general problem. Unrestricted endorsement of both\ntypes of detachment is not tenable, since it leads implausibly to the\nconclusion that Jones is both obligated to tell (the neighbor he is\ncoming) and obligated to not tell. Thus researchers tended to part\ncompany over which principle of the two to endorse (Loewer and Belzer\n1983).\n\nThe Factual Detachment camp typically endorses the view that the\nconditional in (3) in the Chisholm Quartet needs to be interpreted as\na non-material conditional, but otherwise things are as they seem in\n(3): we have a conditional obligation that is a simple composite of a\nnon-material conditional and a pure unary deontic operator in the\nconsequent:\n\n\n\\(\\OB (q\\mid p) \\eqdf p \\Rightarrow \\OB q\\), for some independent\n conditional.[48]\n\n\nTypically, the conditional \\(\\Rightarrow\\) is of the sort made famous\nby Stalnaker and Lewis (Stalnaker 1968, Lewis\n 1973).[49]\n It is then generally maintained that deontic detachment is flawed,\nsince the conditional obligations like those in (2) tell us only what\nto do in ideal circumstances, but they do not necessarily provide\n \u201ccues\u201d[50]\n for action in the actual world, where things are often\ntypically quite sub-ideal, as (4) combined with (1) indicate. Thus\nfrom the fact that Jones ought to go and he ought to tell if he goes,\nit doesn\u2019t follow that what he ought to actually do is\ntell\u2014that would be so only if it was also a fact that he goes to\ntheir aid. At best, we can only say that he ought ideally to\ngo.\n\nThis suggestion seems a bit more difficult when we change the\nconditional to something like \u201cIf Doe does kill his mother, then\nit is obligatory that Doe kills her gently\u201d (Forrester 1984).\nThe idea that my obligation to not kill my mother gently (say for an\ninheritance) merely expresses an \u201cideal\u201d obligation, but\nnot an actual obligation, given that I will kill her, seems hard to\nswallow. So this case makes matters a bit harder for those favoring a\nfactual detachment approach for generating actual obligations.\nSimilarly, it would seem that if it is impermissible for me to kill my\nmother, then it is impermissible for me to do so gently, or to do so\nwhile\n dancing.[51]\n So carte blanche factual detachment seems to allow the mere\nfact that I will take an action in the future (killing my mother) that\nis horribly wrong and completely avoidable now to render obligatory\nanother horrible (but slightly less horrible) action in the future\n(killing my mother gently). The latter action must be completely\navoidable if the former is, and the latter action is one that I would\nseem to be equally obligated to not perform intuitively.\n\nThe deontic detachment camp represented conditional obligations via\ndyadic non-composite obligation operators modeled syntactically on\nconditional probability, following Danielsson 1968; B. Hansson 1969;\nvon Wright 1956, 1964; Lewis 1973, 1974; and Feldman\n 1986.[52]\n On this view, deontic conditionals are viewed as idioms: the meaning\nof the compound is not a straightforward function of the meaning of\nthe parts. The underlying intuition regarding the Chisholm example is\nthat even if it might be true that we will violate some obligation,\nthat doesn\u2019t get us off the hook from obligations that derive\nfrom the original one that we will violate. If I must go help and I\nmust inform my neighbors that I\u2019m coming, if I do go help, then\nI must inform them, and the fact that I will in fact violate the\nprimary obligation does not block the derivative obligation any more\nthan it blocks the primary obligation.\n\nOne early semantic picture for the latter camp was that a sentence of\nthe form \\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\) is true at a world \\(i\\) iff the \\(i\\)-best\n\\(p\\)-worlds are all \\(q\\)-worlds. \\(\\OB q\\) is then true iff \\(\\OB\n(q\\mid \\top),\\) and so iff all the unqualifiedly \\(i\\)-best worlds are\n\\(q\\)-worlds (B. Hansson 1969). Note that this weds preference-based\nsemantic orderings with dyadic conditional\n obligations.[53]\n This reflects a widespread trend. Factual detachment does not work in\nthis case, since even if our world is an I-don\u2019t-go-help-world,\nand the best among the I-don\u2019t-go-help-worlds are\nI-don\u2019t-call-worlds, it does not follow that the\nunqualifiedly best worlds are I-don\u2019t-call-worlds. In\nthis example, these authors would maintain that the unqualifiedly best\nworlds are both I-go worlds and I-call worlds, and the fact that I\nwon\u2019t do what I\u2019m supposed to do won\u2019t change\nthat.\n\nBut one is compelled to ask those in the Deontic Detachment camp: what\nthen is the point of such apparent conditionals if we can\u2019t ever\ndetach them from their apparent antecedents, and how are these\nconditionals related to regular ones? This seems to be the central\nchallenge for this camp. Thus they often endorse a restricted form of\nfactual detachment, of which the following is a representative\ninstance:\n\n\nRestricted Factual Detachment: \\(\\Box p \\amp \\OB (q\\mid\np) \\rightarrow \\OB q\\).\n\n\n\nHere \\(\\Box p\\) might mean various things, for example that \\(p\\) is\nphysically unalterable or necessary as of this moment in\n history.[54]\n Only if \\(p\\) is settled true in some sense, can we conclude from\n\\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\) that \\(\\OB q\\). This certainly helps, but it still\nleaves us with a bit of a puzzle about why this apparent composite of\na conditional and a deontic operator is actually some sort of\nprimitive\n idiom.[55]\n",
