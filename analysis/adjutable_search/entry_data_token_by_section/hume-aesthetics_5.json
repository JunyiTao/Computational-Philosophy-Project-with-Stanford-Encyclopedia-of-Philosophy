Hume\u2019s Essay on Taste\u00a0\n\nHume tells us that \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d was written\nin some haste and exists only to permit publication of other essays\n(HL 2, 253). On the advice of Philip Stanhope, Hume removed \u201cOf\nthe Immortality of the Soul\u201d and \u201cOf Suicide\u201d from a\nplanned volume of new essays. His publisher informed him that the\nresulting volume was too slim to print, bind, and sell. Hume then\nbrought the book to an acceptable length by penning a new essay,\n\u201cOf the Standard of Taste.\u201d Hume made nearly two hundred\neditorial corrections over the subsequent twenty years and multiple\neditions, the majority of which involve punctuation. He never altered\nhis argument. The essay is his last word on any topic in\n\u201ccriticism.\u201d In addition to its importance as an\nelaboration of Hume\u2019s views, Kant read the essay in translation\nand it stands to Kant\u2019s mature aesthetic theory in much the way\nthat Hume\u2019s account of cause and effect stands to the\nCritique of Pure Reason. Succinct analyses of their\ncontrasting positions are provided by Kulenkampff (1990), Savile\n(1993, pp. 81\u201384), and Costelloe (2007, pp. 45\u201352).\n\nHume reminds us of the radical difference in kind between matters of\nfact and the pronouncements of sentiment. Verdicts of sentiment lack a\ntruth-value. So it is surprising to find him endorsing the position\nthat many judgments of taste are \u201cabsurd and ridiculous\u201d\n(SOT, 269). Small differences affect taste, yet most people notice\nonly \u201cthe grosser and more palpable qualities of the\nobject\u201d (SOT, 278). Only judges with a more refined taste will\nrespond to the \u201cuniversal\u201d appeal of superior art. Because\nrefinement demands considerable practice, such critics are few in\nnumbers.\n\nIt is tempting to read Hume\u2019s argument as a move away from his\nsignature subjectivism and toward some brand of normative realism. But\na careful reading of the text reveals that nothing is said to deny his\nearlier support for subjectivism and there are no direct endorsements\nof realism. The standard of taste should provide rules for\n\u201cconfirming one sentiment, and condemning another\u201d (SOT,\n268). On this topic, see Brown (1938), Jones (1976, 1984), Shelley\n(1994), and Costelloe (2007, pp. 3\u201317). However, the standard is\nnormative: it must explain why the sentiments of some critics are\nbetter and worse. It does not follow that sentiments are true and\nfalse in any absolute sense. These reflections lead Hume to postulate\nfive criteria for identifying good or \u201ctrue\u201d critics:\n\u201cStrong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by\npractice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice, can\nalone entitle critics to this valuable character\u201d (SOT,\n278).\n\nAfter several stabs at identifying the standard of taste, Hume\nidentifies it as the consensus or \u201cjoint verdict\u201d of\n\u201ctrue critics\u201d (SOT, 278\u201379). However, such critics\nare \u201crare\u201d (SOT, 280) and \u201cfew are qualified to give\njudgment on any work of art\u201d (SOT, 278). Consequently, it is not\nthe verdict of contemporary critics that constitutes the standard, but\nrather the consensus of qualified judges over time and from multiple\ncultures (SOT, 271; SOT, 280). The importance of the so-called\n\u201ctest of time\u201d is emphasized by Savile (1982) and Levinson\n(2002). Either way, the proposal has been criticized on the grounds\nthat it posits a viciously circular analysis of aesthetic value:\naesthetically superior artworks are those endorsed by true critics,\nbut true critics are identified by their endorsement of the best art.\nWhere earlier commentators tend to see circularity, as with Brown\n(1938) and Noxon (1961), more recent interpretations follow Kivy\n(1967) and see a regress problem. Circularity is avoided by\nidentifying good critics who satisfy the five criteria, but this\ngenerates new evaluative questions, for we must determine if their\nresponses are sufficiently delicate, grounded in the\nright comparisons, and so on. For further discussion, see\nCarroll (1984, pp. 189\u2013191), Gracyk (1994, pp. 175\u2013177),\nand Baceski (2013). Based on these problems, some readings of the\nessay reject the joint verdict of critics as Hume\u2019s standard.\nFor example, Costelloe (2007, pp. 2\u201314) argues that the\n\u201cgeneral rules of art\u201d are his actual standard.\n\nFurthermore, there is disagreement on the question of whether Hume\nholds that these true critics will be uniform in their verdicts.\nInterpretation of Hume\u2019s position is complicated by the way that\nhe consistently affirms his motivating insight, borrowed from\nHutcheson, that sentiment is the essence of evaluation. Even the worst\ncritic says nothing false in foolishly saying that one work is better\nthan another, however misguided their sentiment. Passages where even\nthe best critics will diverge in their evaluations are emphasized by\nWieand (1984), Savile (1993, pp. 70\u201371), and Mothersill (1997).\nMost notably, all critics have \u201cinnocent and unavoidable\u201d\npreferences (SOT, 281) and so they are better or worse at evaluating\ndifferent categories of art. Furthermore, these preferences change\nduring the lifetime of each critic. Consequently, the critical\njudgments of some critics will diverge from those of other highly\nqualified critics. But when critics\u2019 differences arise from\nunavoidable and \u201cblameless,\u201d preferences, there is no\ninterference of prejudice (SOT, 280). In short, the problem of finding\na standard of taste leads Hume to the problem of deciding which\ndisagreements are blameless, in order to distinguish them from\nprejudices that disqualify a sentiment as a public recommendation.\n\nThis reading of Hume is challenged by an interpretation that\nidentifies the standard of taste with ideal critics. (The phrase does\nnot appear in Hume.) That is, instead of real people who can guide us\ndespite their unavoidable and intransigent biases, Hume\u2019s true\ncritics are ideal or perfect evaluators. The case that Hume\u2019s\ncritics are ideal critics who never disagree is made by Shelley (1994,\n2003) and Costelloe (2007, pp. 17\u201318), and disputed in various\nways by Guyer (2005), Ross (2008), Galgut (2012), and\nDur\u00e0-Vil\u00e0 (2015).\n\nHume highlights only two sources that contribute to\n\u201cblameless,\u201d differences of sentiment among qualified\ncritics: basic dispositions of character, and moral differences\narising from cultural differences (SOT, 280). Today, we are more\nlikely to notice a third source of disagreement, Hume\u2019s\nrecognition that different objects reflect distinct species of beauty.\nBecoming a qualified judge of epic poetry does not contribute to being\na qualified judge of architecture. Addison is a better writer than\nJohn Locke, but the comparison assumes that they are both writing\nphilosophy (EHU, 7). We can compare John Milton and John Ogilby, and\nonly a false critic would rank Ogilby above Milton (SOT, 269). But it\nmakes no sense to compare Milton and Addison, for Milton is a poet,\nnot a philosopher.\n\nFurthermore, different cultures employ different customs when handling\nthe same artistic medium. \u201cYou will never convince a man, who is\nnot accustomed to Italian music, and has not an ear to follow its\nintricacies, that a Scotch tune is not preferable\u201d (S, 217). So\nthe good critic must overcome the challenge of cultural prejudice.\n\u201cA critic of a different age or nation, who should peruse this\ndiscourse, must have all these circumstances in his eye, and must\nplace himself in the same situation as the audience, in order to form\na true judgment of the oration\u201d (SOT, 276). Hume emphasizes the\ngreat difficulties involved in overcoming the prejudices of\none\u2019s time and place (SOT, 281\u201382).\n\nIn the wake of a post-Kantian tradition that endorses art\u2019s\nautonomy, many readers balk at Hume\u2019s strong endorsement of the\nrelevance moral judgment upon aesthetic evaluation (SOT,\n283\u201384). Hume discusses the moral failing of several plays (SOT,\n284) and of the Koran, considered as a literary\n\u201cperformance\u201d (SOT, 267). How can Hume reconcile this\nposition with his endorsement of Batteux\u2019s influential thesis,\nin which the mechanical arts are distinguished from fine art by the\nfact that the latter exists only to provide pleasure? (\u201cOf\nTragedy\u201d proceeds as if literature exists solely to provide the\npleasure of the experience.) But there is also a side of Hume that\nrefuses to distinguish between literature and other,\n\u201cpractical\u201d writing. Every work of art is evaluated\naccording to its distinctive purpose, with poetry alone singled out as\nhaving the purpose of \u201cpleasing\u201d the imagination (SOT,\n277). Ultimately, there is very little art that Hume might treat as\nart-for-art\u2019s-sake.\n\nThere should be no great surprise that Hume insists that moral\njudgments must sometimes enter into our aesthetic evaluations. (Good\nintroductions to Hume\u2019s view are provided by Mason (2001),\nDadlez (2002), and Winegar (2011).) Hume does not offer a sharp\ndistinction between moral and aesthetic taste. Evaluations that\nsubsequent aesthetic theories regard as a purely aesthetic are, for\nHume, concluding sentiments following numerous observations of\ncontributing strengths and weaknesses. When a work of art represents\nhuman activity, then Hume\u2019s account of moral evaluation requires\nthat moral sentiment accompany apprehension of the action. The\nfictional status of the work weakens our sympathetic response, but the\nmere sequence of ideas will be sufficient to produce weaker versions\nof the sentiments that one would have if one were faced with the\nactual events. Given Hume\u2019s moral theory, there is no\npossibility of suspending our moral response. Moral sentiments are\nnatural and immediate. At best, one can gain a better understanding of\nthe cultural context responsible for the work, so that one\u2019s\nmoral sentiments will not be negative through mere prejudice.\nHume\u2019s theory of sentiments requires that if we are going to\nhave an aesthetic evaluation of a play\u2019s plotting and language,\nthen we are also going to have a moral response to its display of\nvirtue and vice. Both must enter into our final sentiment of\napprobation or disapprobation.\n\nAlthough Hume emphasizes the variety of responses that different\ngroups and individuals have with the same works, some sources of\npreference are \u201cblameless\u201d (SOT, 280) and\n\u201cinnocent\u201d (SOT, 281). Despite myriad differences, there\nare two basic types of taste: vulgar taste and refined taste. Given\nhis thorough anti-realism about values, Hume cannot dismiss vulgar\ntaste as subjective and mistaken. Hume has a different strategy for\nrecommending refined taste as the more objective of the pair. Vulgar\ntaste is more idiosyncratic and capricious. Refined taste is more\nproperly rule-governed and stable. The two are equally subject to\n\u201crules,\u201d but the person of refined taste is better\ninformed about the material.\n\nHume\u2019s contrast of vulgar and refined taste parallels his\ngeneral treatment of the doxastic positions of the vulgar and the wise\n(T, 150; EHU, 110). Vulgar thinking is dominated by \u201cthe first\ninfluence of general rules\u201d upon the mind. Such rules are\ninstinctively but \u201crashly formed\u201d to regulate the\nimagination. If these rules are allowed to govern thought in the\nabsence of further reflection and refinement, the result is prejudice\ninstead of wisdom. (T, 146,150) The wise, in contrast, take care to\nsurvey the broadest possible range of experience, allowing a\n\u201csecond influence of general rules\u201d to supplant the first.\nIn this manner, the \u201ccapricious and uncertain\u201d ideas of\nthe vulgar give way to \u201cthe more general and authentic\noperations of the understanding\u201d and the superior judgments of\nthe wise (T, 150). As for the normative question of why the refined\njudgments of the wise are preferable to the rash prejudices of the\nvulgar, Hume is content that moral sense assigns approbation to the\n\u201coriginal instincts\u201d underlying moral and aesthetic taste\n(T, 619).\n\nHaving argued that we can overcome prejudice and make superior\nassessments of ordinary matters of fact, Hume imports his contrast of\nvulgarity and wisdom into his aesthetic theory. Sound understanding\nmakes inferences and arrives at a belief. Beliefs influence taste.\nAlthough a judgment of taste terminates in a reflective passion,\nrather than in a belief with a truth-value, taste employs operations\nof the imagination subject to rules internalized by the judging\nsubject. Consequently, the contrast between first and second\ninfluences of general rules applies as much to taste as to\n\u201cwisdom.\u201d Vulgar taste should betray the same degree of\ncapriciousness and prejudice as vulgar reasoning. Good taste, in\ncontrast, should be more stable, for it will display \u201ca certain\npoint of view\u201d appropriate to its object (SOT, 276). Refined\ntaste reflects what Hume elsewhere calls the \u201cmore\ngeneral\u201d view. As with moral response, good taste meets with\napprobation while a prejudiced taste \u201closes all credit and\nauthority\u201d (SOT, 277). However, as a matter of interpretation,\nHume\u2019s references to a requisite \u201cdelicacy of\nimagination\u201d (SOT, 272) complicate and obscure the account, for\nit is not clear what this delicacy is, nor how it contributes to a\nmore settled, general view. Recent explorations of this problem\ninclude Townsend (2001, pp. 204\u2013206), and Gracyk (2011).\n\nSo what are the rules of taste, over and above any rules or principles\ninvolved in sound judgment about the object of taste? Surprisingly,\nHume never offers a clear case of one. At least two proposals about\nsuch rules can be extracted from Hume\u2019s example of\nSancho\u2019s kin and the hogshead of wine, Hume\u2019s\n\u201cevidence\u201d that there are general rules of taste (SOT,\n272\u201373). On the one hand, it is tempting to read the rules as\nstrictly parallel with the empirical laws discussed in the\nTreatise and first Enquiry. If so, they are causal\nlaws specifying which properties and combinations of properties cause\nwhat kind and degree of pleasure. An example might be, \u201cAn\naftertaste of iron or leather reduces the pleasure taken in an\notherwise good wine.\u201d Unfortunately, such rules seem suitable\nonly for arriving at some probability about the likely effect of\ndrinking such wine. Applying such a rule may result in a belief about\nthe wine, but knowing the rule would not encourage the requisite\nsentiment. Where we can find them, rules of this sort are useful for\nseparating true from pretend critics, if only in allowing us to point\nout inconsistencies in critical response (SOT 273\u201374).\n\nBut general rules of taste have a second function. Even if rules\n\u201chad never been methodized\u201d (SOT, 273), their existence\nsupports the view that practice and comparison improves taste (SOT,\n275). Those with adequate experience of a particular art form will\nperceive cases with greater accuracy. The existence of rules gives\nreason to agree that practice heightens the subject\u2019s awareness\nof disruptive impressions (the taste of iron) and missing impressions\n(no fruity bouquet), resulting in a more reflective adjudication of\nthe whole experience. They will also direct the imagination to expect\nvarious combinations of properties in light of one\u2019s recognition\nthat it is a thing of a specific kind. Properly amended to reflect\nmental rather than bodily taste, the story of Sancho\u2019s kinsmen\nunderlies the whole argument of \u201cThe Standard of Taste.\u201d\nEven if the rule has not been formalized, the wine taster will operate\nas if reasoning from a rule (e.g., \u201csince this is red wine, it\nwill have a fruity bouquet but no hint of leather or iron\u201d). The\nexperienced reader or viewer will approach art with \u201cthe same\nexcellence of faculties which contributes to the improvement of\nreason\u201d (SOT, 278), discovering the true character of the object\nwithin \u201cthe disorder, in which they are presented\u201d (SOT,\n273).\n",
