He takes issue with a\ntendency in queer theory to represent gender/sex as performance and, in\nHalberstam's work, fictions. (As has been noted, for some trans\npeople, the view that gender is unreal or artificial seems to undo\ntheir very attempts to see themselves as \u201creal men\u201d or\n\u201creal women\u201d). Yet, while there may be some grounds for\nsome political complaint with this theoretical account, Prosser falls\nprey to a view which holds butch lesbian masculine presentation as\nmerely artificial or gender play, in contrast with the\n\u201creality\u201d and \u201cdepth\u201d present in the case of\nFTMs. In this way, he does not sufficiently differentiate between lived\nlives that may (or may not) be described as \u201cqueer\u201d (e.g.\nbutch masculinities) and an academic queer/postmodern theoretical\nstarting point (1995, 487). The latter may very well involve viewing\nall gender as performance and identity as fictional. However,\n\u201cqueer\u201d lives (involving butch masculinities) need not be\nviewed this way. To distinguish butch as artificial and transsexual as\nreal is to refuse to acknowledge the relationship of many butch\nindividuals to gender and identity.\n\nProsser's strategy for marking a trans theoretical vantage point\nis to draw a contrast between the centrality of performance (in queer\ntheory) and narrative (for transsexual people). He correctly notes a\ntendency in postmodern queer theory to raise questions about the\npolitical role of narratives (1995, 484). Such narratives may be seen\nto involve the illusion of a false unity and they may also involve\nexclusionary politics. Yet narratives, according to Prosser, are\ncentral to the accounts of transsexuals and such narratives involve the\nnotion of home and belonging (1995, 488). This appeal to narrative\nseems in tension with a picture which underscores the fragmentation of\ncoherent narratives into diverse performances and which identifies\nsubversion with the disruption of narrative-based identities. Coherent\nnarratives, even if ultimately fictional, play important\nintelligibility-conferring roles in the lives of transsexuals,\naccording to Prosser. And this cannot be well-accommodated in accounts\nwhich aim to undermine such coherence.\n\nIn Prosser's view, transsexual narratives are driven by a sense\nof feeling not at home in one's body, through a journey of\nsurgical change, ultimately culminating in a coming home to oneself\n(and one's body) (1995, 490). In this way, the body and bodily\ndiscomfort constitute the \u201cdepth\u201d or \u201creality\u201d\nthat stands in contrast to the view that body is sexed through\nperformative gender behavior which constitutes it as the container of\ngender identity. In light of this, Prosser concludes that queer\ntheory's use of transsexuals to undermine gender as mere\nperformance fails to do justice to the importance of narrative and\nbelonging in trans identities.\n\nDrawing on Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues, Prosser argues\nthat transgender (construed as a departure from traditional\ntranssexuality) likewise involves a narrative structure. In this case,\nhowever, the narrative involves making a home of the in-between space\nbetween man and woman (1995, 500). Since, however, it involves more\nthan mere performance (i.e., dysphoria concerning one's body) as\nwell as the centrality of narrative, it ought to be distinguished from\ngeneric understandings of queer. He later alters his view slightly,\nplacing transgender in a liminal space between queer and transsexual,\nadmitting far more ambivalence around the notion of home and belonging\n(1998, 177).\n\nWhile Prosser may be right to emphasize the importance of narratives in\nthe identities of transsexual and transgender people, however, it is\nhardly clear that he can maintain the fairly sharp lines he hopes to\ndraw between transsexual, transgender, and queer. The narrative\nstructure of identity (as well as notions of home and belonging) may be\nimportant for many people (including queer-identified ones). And, while\nfor Prosser what is distinctive about transsexual/transgender\nnarratives is that they involve a feeling of bodily unbelonging, it\nisn't clear why such dysphoria may not be present among non\ntrans-identified people. Moreover, his view seems to take for granted\nthe view that for trans people there is always a \u201chome\u201d to\nwhich one might return (or, at least, imagine). Yet this is to assume\nthat trans people have the means by which to find this belonging (in\ntheir bodies, etc.). Given economic realities, however, this is far\nfrom clear. Indeed, given the meagerness of linguistic resources to\neven explain trans experiences, it isn't obvious how, in some\ncases, so much as an imaginary home might be formulated.\n",
