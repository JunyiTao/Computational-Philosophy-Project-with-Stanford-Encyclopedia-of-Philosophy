Challenges to Identifying the Minimal Conditions of Personal Autonomy\n\n\nAll the proposals just considered contribute to our understanding\nof the various roles that agents can play in their\nown actions. They articulate various ideals that agents can realize to\nvarious degrees when they act. In so doing, they shed light on how,\nwith the proper training, a very young child, whose deference to the\nauthority of her own judgments is little more than the form of\nself-government, can develop into an exemplary self-governing agent.\n\n\nThis is a very important contribution. Nonetheless, it falls short\nof giving us everything we have reason to expect from an account of\npersonal autonomy. In particular, challenges to the different\napproaches sketched above suggest that they do not spell out the\nminimal conditions under which a person\u2019s exercise of authority over\nhow she behaves reflects her own power to determine how\nshe exercises this authority. Minimal self-government seems to\nrequire nothing more nor less than being the power behind whatever\nreasoning directly gives rise to one\u2019s behavior. Yet none of the\naccounts we have canvassed here seems to capture this important, most\nbasic, form of self-government. Nor, it seems, does any combination of\nthese accounts.\n\n\nThe worry that the coherence of one\u2019s contemporaneous attitudes does\nnot suffice for even minimal self-government is grounded in the\napparent possibility that a person could be brainwashed, or otherwise\ncompelled, to endorse a given motive. Indeed, her brain could be\nmanipulated in such a way that each of her endorsements is highly\nresponsive to reasons. This has led some philosophers to supplement\ncoherentist accounts of autonomy with additional conditions that place\nconstraints on the causal history of an agent\u2019s endorsements,\nconstraints of the very sort singled out in the\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning accounts. These supplements face a\nsignificant challenge, however: it is very difficult to spell out the\ndistinction between autonomy-conferring reasoning and\nautonomy-undermining reasoning without implicitly appealing to\nthe very phenomenon one is trying to explain.\n\n\nEven if historical approaches to autonomy can successfully overcome\nthis difficulty, they do nothing to address the fact that coherence is\nnot even necessary for autonomous agency. An agent need not sacrifice\nher autonomy in order to decide to act contrary to her long-term\ncommitments and concerns; acting \u201cout of character\u201d is not\na sufficient condition for failing to govern oneself.  Though a\n\u201cweak-willed\u201d agent is hardly a paradigm example of\nsomeone who governs herself when she acts, she too plays a decisive\nrole in the relative power of her own motives; she authorizes her\nbehavior, even though she believes that she has good reason to act\notherwise. It is notoriously difficult to make sense of such an\nexercise of\n authority.[13] \nFor our purposes here, however, it\nsuffices to note that if weakness of will is a genuine phenomenon,\nthen human agents have the capacity to govern themselves in a way that\nthey themselves take to be unjustified. They can assert an authority\nover themselves that challenges the authority of their very own\nreason.\n\n\nOf course, someone whose action is caused in this way does not\ngovern herself as thoroughly as someone whose will is\n\u201cstrong\u201d; she acts for a reason that she herself deems\ninadequate; and so she is not (adequately) governed by the norms of her\nown thought. Nonetheless, even under these conditions, the desires that\nmove her to act do so on her own authority. To use what is perhaps the\nmost important metaphor in the literature on personal autonomy, the\nweak-willed agent \u201cidentifies with\u201d her motives in whatever\nway she must in order to be accountable for their effects. It is not\nsimply that what she does is the result of an earlier autonomous\naction. Rather, her accountability is grounded in her contemporaneous\nrelation to what she is doing.\n\nThe possibility of weakness of will points to the more general fact\nthat an agent\u2019s authorization of her own motives need not take the\nform of the judgment that it would not be better to act otherwise.\nVarious forms of perversity are perfectly compatible with autonomous\nagency.  Some philosophers believe that it is also possible for agents\nto defy their own contemporaneous normative verdicts without defying\nanything very deep about themselves. A woman, for example, may\nconclude that even though she has an overriding reason to give up her\nchild for adoption, she cannot recognize herself in this action, and\nso cannot identify with the desire to perform\n it.[14]\nReasonable people will surely disagree about how best to interpret any\nparticular example. But human experience does seem to support the\ngeneral point: the human capacity for self-reflection enables human\nagents to distance themselves in thought from every aspect of their\nown psyches\u2014even their rational reflections. Given this\npossibility, a person\u2019s identification with her motives cannot be\ncashed out in terms of higher-order attitudes of approval and\ndisapproval, or in terms of the rational reflections that typically\nground these attitudes.\n\n\nSimilar concerns are raised by the appeal to plans. Though plans\noften enable a person to exercise some measure of control over her life\nas a whole, a person can govern herself at a particular time even while\ndefying her earlier attempts to place constraints on how she will\ngovern herself at this time. She can take it upon herself to abandon\nher plans, or to modify them in ways she did not anticipate when she\nfirst made them. She can even reject the counsel of the long-term\nvalues that provide the underlying rationale for these plans.\n\n\nReflections along these lines have led some to conclude that we are\nbound to come up empty-handed as long as we think of an agent\u2019s\nidentification with her motives as a self-relation she is responsible\nfor securing. For, as long as we take this approach, we appear to be\nstuck with the question: under what conditions does the agent govern\nher identification with some motive? what conditions must she satisfy\nin order to identify with the motives that move her to identify with\nsome of her motives and not others? under what conditions does she\nauthorize the attitudes and/or mental activities that issue in a given\nlower-order authorization? If we are to escape the regress such\nquestions evoke, it seems that there must be an attitude that can be\nidentified with the agent\u2019s point of view simply by virtue of being the\nattitude it is; there must be an attitude from which no agent can\npossibly be alienated. To be sure, if\u2014like most animals\u2014rational \nagents could not distance themselves from their own motives,\nthen they would be incapable of governing themselves. Self-government\nrequires two points of view: that of the governing authority, and that\nof the governed. Nonetheless, if there is to be an end to the potential\nregress of identifications, it seems that there must also be a limit to\nthe capacity for self-alienation.\n\n\nAs we have seen, no such limitation seems to apply where the mental\nstate at stake is an agent\u2019s highest-order desire, evaluative\njudgment, or plan, or even an integrated combination of such\nattitudes. The only attitude from which it seems that no agent can be\nalienated is the desire to have sufficient power to determine one\u2019s\nown motives\u2014the desire to be a self-governing\n agent.[15]\n Even if, however, we leave to one side the\nquestion of whether this desire can really be attributed to every\npotentially self-governing agent, it does not seem to be an adequate\nbasis for distinguishing motives whose power can be attributed to the\nagent herself from motives that are not in this sense internal. For if\na desire underlies every action performed by a potentially\nself-governing agent, then it plays a causal role even when an agent\nfails to govern her motives in the minimal way necessary to be\naccountable for them. It thus cannot be the key to any account of what\nis special about self-governing \n agency[16].\n\n\n\nPerhaps there is no attitude to which we can point in order to\ndistinguish between cases in which the power of an agent\u2019s motives can\nbe directly attributed to her and cases in which her authority\nover her motives is a mere formality. If so, then this might seem to be\na reason to favor accounts that tie autonomous agency to the agent\u2019s\nresponsiveness to reasons. Unfortunately, however, these accounts have\nproblems of their own. Most importantly, it seems as though a person\ncan govern herself even if she does not understand the significance of\nwhat she is doing. To be sure, if someone\u2019s ignorance is perfectly\nreasonable, then she may not be to blame if she does something wrong.\nBut under such circumstances, what frees her from blame is the fact\nthat she has good reason to be ignorant. There appears to be no basis\nfor assuming that, in addition to lacking certain relevant information,\nshe is not really the (ill-informed) power behind her authorization of\nher action.\n\n\nIn killing Desdemona, Othello fails to accomplish his aim of doing\nwhat he has good reason to do. But this does not prevent him from\nbeing the author of his own actions. Nor would he necessarily have\nbeen prevented from governing himself if, given his character and\ncircumstances, he had been unable to \u201ctrack\u201d the\nevaluative and nonevaluative facts: he would still have been\naccountable for what he did if his reason for doing it had been that\nhe was too jealous, or too stubborn, or too vain, or too hot-tempered\nto be capable of responding to the wide range of reasons against\nbelieving that his wife was unfaithful to him\u2014and the wide\nrange of reasons against killing her even if she was\n unfaithful.[17]\n More carefully, to\ninsist that he would not have been accountable under these\ncircumstances, we must abandon the assumption that autonomous agency is\npossible even if all actions can, in principle, be explained in terms\nof deterministic laws of nature. In other words, we must accept the\nincompatibilist thesis that if a person\u2019s character is the product of\nforces over which he never had any control, and if his character traits\ndetermine his choices, then even if his motives are responsive to\nreasons, he is not responsible for their motivating force.\n\n\nThe preceding reflections call attention to how difficult it is to\ndistinguish the conditions of ideal self-government from the\nconditions under which one is sufficiently self-governing to be\nresponsible for the motivating power of one\u2019s desires. The difficulty\nis manifested in the fact that as soon as we try to pin down the\nminimal, threshold conditions of autonomous agency, we seem to\ncome up against the conditions necessary for agency\nitself.\n\n\nConsider, for example, an alleged paradigm case of an agent who fails\nto govern herself: a person who takes drugs even though she would\nrather resist the motivating force of her addiction. It is widely\nagreed that, even if many people who fit this description are merely\nweak-willed, not all of them are: some unwilling addicts are not\nself-governing in even the minimal sense. According to coherentist and\nresponsiveness-to-reasoning accounts, this is because such addicts\nare, in effect, \u201cpassive bystanders\u201d to their own\nmotives. But even if we could find a satisfactory account of the\nrelevant passivity, this diagnosis would be problematic. For it\nassimilates the addict to someone whose behavior does not even qualify\nas an action\u2014someone, e.g., with Tourette\u2019s Syndrome,\nwhose verbal outbursts and bodily movements are not\neven voluntary. It thus fails to shed light on the conditions\nunder which someone acts\u2014intentionally, even \ndeliberately\u2014without being accountable for what she does. (The same problem\narises for the proposal that autonomous agents differ from other\nagents in virtue of their special way of understanding what they are\nup to.  Regardless of whether someone governs her intentional actions,\nshe knows what she is doing without having to observe her behavior.\nIf someone had to observe her own behavior in order to discover what\nshe was up to, then this behavior would not qualify as her action.)\n\n\n\nIf someone\u2019s motives directly defy her attempt to exercise authority\nover her actions, then their power is not only independent of her\nauthority; they bypass her agency altogether. Even if under these\nconditions a person can acknowledge that there is something to be said\nfor behaving as she does, she is as alienated from the power of her own\nmotives as she is from the power of the physiological states that\nproduce her reflex movements. She is not an autonomous agent because\nshe is not an agent at \n all[18].\n\n\n\nOf course, there is a sense in which the addict, but not the victim\nof Tourette\u2019s, is responsive to reasons. But even if we could spell out\nthis distinction in a satisfactory way, we still face the problem of\nexplaining why an agent\u2019s capacity to respond to external reality is\nrelevant to her capacity to govern herself. And there are other\nproblems too. If, for example, nonaction differs from action in virtue\nof being unresponsive to reasons, then it follows that nonrational\nanimals never really act, or that acting from instinct is acting for\nreasons. It is not clear what considerations could overcome the\nimplausibility of these implications.\n",
