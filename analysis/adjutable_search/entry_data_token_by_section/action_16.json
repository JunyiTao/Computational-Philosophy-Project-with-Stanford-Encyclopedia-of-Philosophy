    "main_text": "The Ontology of Actions || The Debate Over Basic Action\n5.3 The Debate Over Basic Action\n\nConsideration of cases like that of the pumper naturally raises a\nquestion about their structure: what kind of shape could such\na rationalizing explanation take? Could it go on forever? To answer\nthis, consider the pumper once more, and suppose he poisons the\ninhabitants of the house. It is true, then, that he poisoned the\ninhabitants of the house by pumping water, and he did this by moving\nhis hands. Because the poisoning and the pumping are done by doing\nsomething else, they are called \u201dnon-basic\u201c actions.\nHowever, it has been argued that there must be at least some actions\nthat are \u201dbasic\u2019\u201c, done not by doing anything else.\nOtherwise, we appear to be caught in various forms of a vicious\nregress.\n\nFor example, if to do A one must do B, and to do\nB one must do C, and so on ad infinitum,\ndoing anything would seem to require doing an infinite number of\nthings. More worrying, the beginning of action seems to be\n\u201dlogically out of reach\u201c for the agent, since there is\nalways something else that she would have to do before she begins to\ndo anything (Danto 1979, 471). Again, it seems that for an agent to\nknow what she is currently doing, she needs to know how to do the\nthings by which she does it; but unless there is something that she\ncan know how to do just by doing it, it will be impossible for her to\nknow what she is doing at all (Hornsby 2013).\n\nArguments of this sort convinced most scholars that there must be\nbasic actions (though see Baier 1971 and Sneddon 2001 for early\ndissent). The debate then centered on which actions are\nbasic. Many scholars held that simple bodily movements, like moving a\nfinger or raising an eyebrow, were basic, while others held that they\ncould be more complex (tying one\u2019s shoes), or that they must be\nsimpler: perhaps only mental actions, or tryings were basic. After\nall, I move my finger by attempting to move it; and we need to\ndistinguish between the attempt and the movement, since sometimes the\nattempt occurs without the movement (e.g. if my fingers are suddenly\nparalized) (Prichard 1945: Hornsby 1980; O\u2019Shaughnessy 1980; see\nCleveland 1997, ch.5 for criticism).\n\nAs several scholars have noted, part of what is at issue in this\ndebate are different notions of basicness, corresponding to different\nunderstandings of the clause \u201dby doing something else\u201c\n(Baier 1971; Annas 1978; Hornsby 1980). It is common to draw a\nthree-fold distinction: (i) know-how basicness; (ii) causal basicness;\nand (iii) teleological basicness. An action is know-how basic iff\nthere is no other (type of) action by which the agent knows how to do\nthe one in question. An action is causally basic iff there is no other\n(token) action that causes it. An action is teleologically basic iff\nthere is no other (token) action by means of which the agent does it.\nTo illustrate in a way that highlights the differences, consider\npitching a baseball. Arguably, this action is know-how basic, since\nthe pitcher may not know a more basic action by which to do it: of\ncourse, the agent may know how to move her hands independently, but\nshe may be unable to move her hands in the particular way in which she\ndoes when she throws the baseball unless she were actually throwing\nthe baseball. Whether the action is causally basic depends on whether\nwe think there is another action that causes it, such as the\npitcher\u2019s moving of his hands. Finally, and independently of the\nquestion of causation, the action appears to be teleologically\nnon-basic, since the moving of his hands is certainly both a means and\nan action by which the pitcher pitches. The consensus for many years\nwas that there must be basic actions in all three senses.\n\nHowever, this widespread consensus about teleological basicness has\nrecently been called into question by Michael Thompson and other\ndefenders of \u201dnaive\u201c action theory (Thompson 2008,\n107\u2013119). Thompson considers the case of a person, P,\nwho has pushed a stone from point \u03b1 to \u03c9. Let \u03b2 be\nthe halfway point between \u03b1 and \u03c9. It seems that if\nP pushed the stone from \u03b1 to \u03c9 intentionally,\nthen he pushed the stone from \u03b1 to \u03b2 intentionally. Now,\nlet \u03b3 be the halfway point between \u03b1 and \u03b2. Once\nagain, it seems that P pushed the stone from \u03b1 to\n\u03b3 intentionally. And so on. It seems, then, that there will\nalways be a further action by which P pushed the stone. In\nother words, there is no basic action. Moreover, as a number of\nauthors have noted (Small 2012; Lavin 2013), the argument can be\ngeneralized for virtually every action, since it can be presented in\nterms of a series of time-segments (instead of place-segments), and\nvirtually every action takes place over time. (For critical\ndiscussion, see Ford 2018.)\n\nBuilding on this argument, Lavin (2013) presents a further challenge\nto the view that there must be (teleological) basic action.\nLavin\u2019s argument centers on the relation of the agent to her\nactions. Consider first a non-basic action, like poisoning the\ninhabitants of the house. The agent\u2019s relation to this action is\nitself an agential matter, since the agent poisons the inhabitants by\ndoing something else intentionally (operating the pump). Now consider\nan arbitrary basic action, A. By definition, the agent\ndoesn\u2019t do A by doing anything else. However, this is\nan action that occurs through time, so, presumably there are\nhappenings h1, h2, \u2026,\nhn by which A takes place. But since\nh1, h2, \u2026, hn are\nmere happenings, this means that the agent relates to A\nnon-agentially. Now, Lavin grants that it may be possible sometimes\nfor us to relate to our actions non-agentially; but it would be\nalarming if this was necessarily the case, as defenders of basic\naction are committed to hold. It would mean that agents are\nnecessarily alienated from their actions, in the way labourers are\nalienated from their labour in Marx\u2019s critique of capitalism. In\nturn, Lavin argues that this would make it impossible for agents to\nhave self-knowledge of their own actions, since self-knowledge is\ngrounded on our agential relation.\n\nThere is a growing literature responding to Thompson\u2019s and\nLavin\u2019s challenges, both refining the arguments, or presenting\nobjections to it (Setiya 2012; Hornsby 2013; Lynch 2017; Frost 2019;\nSmall 2019). This is not surprising, since the debate about basic\nactions has important repercussions for other questions about the\nnature of intentional action. For example, Lavin (2013) holds that\ndefenders of (teleologically) basic action are committed to a\n\u201ddecompositional account\u201c of agency (see section 1). After\nall, if there are basic actions, we may be able to give an account of\nwhat makes something an action in terms of the non-agential relation\nan agent bears to her basic actions. Moreover, Ford (2017; 2018) notes\nthat Thompson\u2019s argument suggests a novel way to pursue action\ntheory, one that defines action not in terms of reasons for\naction but, in the first instance, in terms of the means by which\nan action is pursued.The latter, Ford holds, better captures the\nagential perspective: in the context of deliberation, what the agent\nasks is How to pursue a particular course of action, rather\nthan Why she is doing something. Finally, the debate may have\nrepercussions for our understanding of the relation between skill and\nintentional action. For example, both Frost and Small suggest that at\nthe most fundamental level, our agency depends on our exercise of\npractical skills by which we enter an instrumental order\nwithout consciously representing that order at the level of\npropositional thought (Small 2012; 2019; Frost 2019).\n",
