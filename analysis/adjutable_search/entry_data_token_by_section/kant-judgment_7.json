    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Judgment: Transcendental Idealism\n3. The Metaphysics of Judgment: Transcendental Idealism\n\nThere is a very real sense in which Kant\u2019s positive metaphysics\nin the Critique of Pure Reason is essentially an elaboration\nof his theory of judgment: \u201cit is not at all [traditional]\nmetaphysics that the Critique is doing but a whole new\nscience, never before attempted, namely the critique of an a priori\njudging reason\u201d (10: 340). This results directly from the\nconjunction of the centrality thesis and the transcendental idealism\nthesis: judgment is the central cognitive activity of the human mind,\nand judgments are objectively valid and true if and only if the\nmetaphysics of transcendental idealism is correct. In this section,\nthe crucial connection between judgment and transcendental idealism\nwill be spelled out in more detail.\n",
