    "main_text": "Ontological and Metaphysical Commitments in Biomedicine || Biomedical conceptions of health and disease\n2.2 Biomedical conceptions of health and disease\n\nThe preceding section on purpose in biomedicine leads directly to the\nrelated issue of how health and disease are conceptualized in\nbiomedicine. This is something that will only be dealt with very\nbriefly here, in part to avoid duplicating the content in the entry on\n Concepts of Health and Disease.\n Debates over the meaning of health and disease\u2014including how\nthe two are connected\u2014are central to philosophy of medicine.\nThis entry will not attempt to summarize that complex literature, and\nrather focus on how conceptions of health and disease relate to\nbiomedicine, including related disputes over how disease relates to\ndisability justice matters, and ways in which purportedly objective\nbiomedical conceptions of disease can be co-opted for dubious\npurposes.\n\nOf the different philosophical accounts of health and disease,\nChristopher Boorse\u2019s naturalistic Biostatistical Theory (BST) of\ndisease gives the account that is perhaps most tightly linked with the\nphilosophical commitments of biomedicine. Boorse\u2019s revised\naccount of the BST states:\n\n\nThe reference class is a natural class of organisms of\nuniform functional design; specifically, an age group of a sex of a\nspecies.\nA normal function of a part or process within members of\nthe reference class is a statistically typical contribution by it to\ntheir individual survival [or] reproduction.\nHealth in a member of the reference class is normal\nfunctional ability: the readiness of each internal part to\nperform all its normal functions on typical occasions with at least\ntypical efficiency.\nA disease [later, pathological condition] is a\ntype of internal state which impairs health, i.e., reduces\none or more functional abilities below typical efficiency (Boorse 2014:\n684, amending Boorse 1977: 562).\n\n\n\nThe idea is that we can wield insights of biochemistry, pathology, and\nevolutionary biology to together yield an objective means of\n\u2018reading\u2019 nature to tell us which states are pathological\nor diseased states, without the interference of messy and culturally\nrooted/biased evaluations. One line of rebuttal is that there is no\nprincipled way of objectively choosing a reference class against which\nto judge that a given part or process is falling short (my blood sugar\nlevels are objectively too high compared to\u2026what exactly?)\n(Kingma 2014). Even if that problem is resolvable, Krueger argues that\nan objective set of criteria for defining states as pathological or\nnot would be a very limited accomplishment. Knowing that my blood\nsugar levels are objectively pathological does not really tell me much\nabout what, if anything, I or my physician ought to do about that\n(Krueger 2015).\n\nFraught as it is to approach health via the functioning of components\nin the body, it is also quite conceptually difficult to measure health\nin a broader sense. Biomedical science practitioners tend to get\ntwisted into conceptual and epistemic knots when attempting to measure\ngeneral/overall health or well-being in a population (Hausman 2015).\nOne key philosophical dispute among health scientists engaged in\npatient health measurement activities is over what sorts/amounts of\nknowledge patients have about their own health states, and how this\nknowledge ought to be accessed (McClimans forthcoming). How much can\nwe glean about a patient\u2019s physical comfort by asking them to\nrate their level of pain on a scale of 1\u201310? How do we solicit\nsuch information without repeating unethical patterns of trust or\nmistrust, rooted in racist/sexist/etc. stereotypes about patients\n(Buchman, Ho, & Goldberg 2017)?\n\nThe notion of disease is biological malfunction is also tied to a pair\nof critiques of the \u201cmedical model\u201d of disability and of\n\u201cmedical model\u201d of mental health. Both models are\ncriticized for reducing the complexities of disability or\npsychological welfare to only the individual-level signs, symptoms,\nand variables recognized by biomedicine (see:\n Disability: Definitions, Models, Experience).\n As traced in Hogan\u2019s history of the concept, the medical model\nis either critiqued as insufficiently attentive to other dimensions\n(especially the social dynamics that drastically shape the relevant\nhealth experiences) or oppressive (since the model empowers biomedical\nexperts to unilaterally dictate the disability/psychiatric categories,\nrelevant evidence, diagnoses, treatments, etc.) (Hogan 2019). This is\nin part a dispute over functioning since debates over normality,\ndifference, and pathology depend on whether/how we commit to the\nnotion that bodies or parts thereof have functions at all. If\none\u2019s legs do not perform the function of walking, are the legs\npathological? Is the person with those legs inherently diseased?\nDisabled? Worse off than if they had legs that could walk? One\nsolution is to simply throw out the notion of normal functioning\n(Amundson 2000). Another related option is to embrace pluralism in the\nsense of accepting that the relationship between disability and\nwell-being or health is complex, variable, and dependent on\nindividual and social contingencies (Campbell & Stramondo\n2017).\n\nOne philosophical complication is that a naturalistic concept of\ndisease, like Boorse\u2019s, does not prevent social processes from\naltering the standards and practices of how the boundaries of these\nnatural categories are drawn in practice. Chronic diseases such as\ncardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes have been targeted by drug\ncompanies to not only create new treatments but to redraw the\nboundaries between healthy vs. pathological, including boundary zones\nsuch as \u201cprediabetes\u201d (Greene 2006). These efforts are in\npart accomplished via the design of clinical trials, which have the\ndangerous distinction of having very high epistemic value in the\nbiomedical community, while remaining highly susceptible to\nmanipulations to the experimental setup that push the evidence one\ndirection or another (Gonz\u00e1lez-Moreno, Saborido, & Teira\n2015).\n\nWhile a naturalistic concept of disease is the most consistent with\nthe ontological assumptions and methodological practices of\nbiomedicine, that has not prevented biomedicine from accommodating a\ncertain type of dissent from the biomedical tenet that biomedicine\nought to focus on diseases and (only) the biological, chemical, and\nphysical aspects thereof (Krieger 2011: 130). The World Health\nOrganization (WHO)\u2014founded in the same post-World War Two period\nas biomedicine\u2014adopted a holistic positive concept of health at\nits founding. i.e., it said that health is the presence of complete\nwell-being (including mental and social well-being) rather than just\nthe absence of disease. This created a direct tension with the core\ntenets of biomedicine, especially the reduction of disease to a set of\nconcrete observable and measurable physical bases (Valles 2018).\nHistorically, the tension was resolved in the case of the WHO by the\norganization, shortly after its founding, effectively self-suppressing\nthe use of its own definition of health in favor of pursuing a\nnarrower set of initiatives to combat particular diseases (e.g., the\ncelebrated Smallpox Eradication Program) (Irwin & Scali 2007).\nThis seems to have been in part because cold war politics made it\npragmatic to not antagonize the United States with pushing a health\nconcept concerned with \u201csocial\u201d well-being, sounding a bit\nreminiscent of socialism (Irwin & Scali 2007). While a\nWHO-type understanding of health is in genuine tension with the\nphilosophical tenets of biomedicine, the tension is manageable in this\ncase by simply pursuing areas of overlap between the different\nconceptions of disease (e.g., investing in infectious disease-control\nstrategies for a population) while ignoring any purported aspects of\nhealth beyond the absence of pathologies (e.g., declining to invest in\nassessing how human-environment relations contribute to a\npopulation\u2019s happiness or misery).\n",
