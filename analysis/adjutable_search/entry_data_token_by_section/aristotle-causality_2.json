    "main_text": "The Four Causes and the Study of Nature\n3. The Four Causes and the Study of Nature\n\nIn the Physics, Aristotle builds on his general account of\nthe four causes by developing explanatory principles that are specific\nto the study of nature. Here Aristotle insists that all four causes\nare involved in the explanation of natural phenomena. By his lights,\nthe job of \u201cthe student of nature is to bring the why-question\nback to them all in the way appropriate to the science of\nnature\u201d (Phys. II 7, 198 a 21\u201323). The best way\nto understand this methodological recommendation is the following: the\nstudy of nature is concerned with natural bodies insofar as they are\nsubject to change, and the job of the student of nature is to provide\nthe explanation of their natural change. The factors that are involved\nin the explanation of natural change turn out to be matter, form, that\nwhich produces the change, and the end of this change. Note that\nAristotle does not say that all four explanatory factors are involved\nin the explanation of each and every instance of natural change.\nRather, he says that an adequate explanation of natural change may\ninvolve a reference to all of them.\n\nAristotle goes on by adding a specification on his doctrine of the\nfour causes: the form and the end often coincide, and they are\nformally the same as that which produces the change (Phys. II\n7, 198 a 23\u201326). This is one of the several times where\nAristotle offers the slogan \u201cit takes a human being to generate\na human being\u201d (for example, Phys. II 2, 194 b 13;\nMetaph. VII 7, 1032 a 25; VII 8, 1033 b 32; IX 8, 1049 b 25;\nXII 3, 1070 a 8; XIV 5, 1092 a 16). This slogan is designed to draw\nattention to the following, fundamental fact: the generation of a\nhuman being can be understood only in light of the end of the process;\nthat is to say, the fully developed human being. The question thus\narises as to what it takes for a human being to be fully developed.\nAristotle frames his answer in terms of the human form, maintaining\nthat a human form is fully realized at the end of the generative\nprocess. This process does not end at birth but continues until the\nhuman being reaches its acme. But this does not explain why it takes\na human being to generate a human being. Note, however, that\na fully developed human being is not only the final outcome of the\ngenerative process; it is also what initiates the entire process. For\nAristotle, the ultimate moving principle responsible for the\ngeneration of a human being is a fully developed living creature of\nthe same kind; that is, a human being who is formally the same as the\nfinal result of the generative process. (A final clarification is in\norder here: Aristotle is committed to a hylomorphic explanation of\nanimal generation. His considered view is that the father supplies the\nform whereas the mother provides the relevant matter.) \n\nThus, the student of nature is often left with three types of causes:\nthe formal/final cause, the efficient cause, and the material cause.\nHowever, the view that there are in nature causes besides material and\nefficient causes was controversial in antiquity. According to\nAristotle, most of his predecessors recognized only the material and\nthe efficient cause. This explains why Aristotle cannot be content\nwith saying that formal and final causes often coincide, but he also\nhas to defend his thesis against an opponent who denies that final\ncausality is a genuine mode of causality.\n",
