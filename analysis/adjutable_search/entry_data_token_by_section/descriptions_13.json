    "main_text": "Objections to the Theory of Descriptions || Donnellan\u2019s distinction and the argument from misdescription\n5.2 Donnellan\u2019s distinction and the argument from misdescription\n\nDonnellan (1966) observed that there is a sense in which Strawson and\nRussell are both right (and both wrong) about the proper analysis of\ndescriptions. He argued that definite descriptions can be used in (at\nleast) two different ways. On a so-called attributive use, a sentence\nof the form \u2018The F is G\u2019 is used to\nexpress a proposition equivalent to \u2018Whatever is uniquely\nF is G\u2019. For example, on seeing murder victim\nSmith\u2019s badly mutilated corpse, Detective Brown might say\n\u201cThe murderer of Smith is insane\u201d thereby communicating\nthe thought that some unique individual murdered Smith and that\nwhoever that individual is, he/she is insane. Alternatively, on a\nreferential use, a sentence of the form \u2018The F is\nG\u2019 is used to pick out a specific individual,\nx, and say of x that x is G. For\nexample, suppose Jones is on trial for Smith\u2019s murder and is\nbehaving quite strangely at the defense table. I point at Jones and\nsay, \u201cThe murderer of Smith is insane\u201d, thereby\ncommunicating the thought that Jones is insane (whether or not Jones\nis the actual murderer).\n\nDonnellan suggested that Russell\u2019s quantificational account of\ndefinite descriptions might capture attributive uses, but that it does\nnot work for referential uses. In effect, we might take Donnellan as\nsaying that in some cases descriptions are Russellian and in some\ncases they are Strawsonian. Perhaps we could even say that the\ndefinite determiner \u2018the\u2019 is ambiguous between these two\ncases (it is not clear whether Donnellan himself intended to endorse a\nlexical ambiguity of this sort).\n\nKripke (1977) responded to Donnellan by arguing that the Russellian\naccount of definite descriptions could, by itself, account for both\nreferential and attributive uses; the difference between the two cases\ncould be entirely a matter of pragmatics. Here is the idea: Grice\nshowed us that there is an important distinction to be made between\nwhat one literally says by an utterance and what one intends to\ncommunicate (what one means) by that utterance. To take a famous\nexample of Grice\u2019s, I might write a letter of recommendation for\na student saying that he is very punctual and has excellent\nhandwriting. Now what I have said is something about the\nstudent\u2019s punctuality and handwriting, but what I meant was that\nthis is a very weak student.\n\nIn a similar vein, we could say that when I use a description\nreferentially\u2014say in Donnellan\u2019s courtroom case\u2014I am\nliterally making a general claim to the effect that there is a\nmurderer of Smith and that he is insane, but what I mean by that\nutterance is that Jones is insane. That is, when I say \u2018The\nmurderer of Smith insane\u2019 what I literally say is that exactly\none person, x, is such that x murdered Smith and\nx is insane, but in that context I would succeed in\ncommunicating the singular proposition (about Jones) that Jones is\ninsane. Kripke gave several reasons for thinking that this Gricean\nsolution was preferable to an ambiguity thesis. One reason was a\ngeneral methodological point that one should not introduce ambiguities\nblithely\u2014doing so is a kind of philosophical cheat.\n\nAlso, Kripke observed that these two uses of definite descriptions are\nreally just subspecies of the general distinction between what is\nmeant (speaker\u2019s reference in Kripke\u2019s terminology) and\nwhat is literally said (semantic reference) and not at all unique to\ndescriptions. Kripke noted that the distinction even applies to uses\nof proper names. So, for example, consider the case where I see a man\nin the distance raking leaves. I take the man to be Jones but it is\nactually Johnson. I say \u2018Jones is really working up a sweat\ntoday\u2019. Now what I have literally said is that Jones is working\nup a sweat, but what I have communicated (what I meant) is something\nabout Johnson. Clearly no one would argue that the name\n\u2018Jones\u2019 is ambiguous between referring to Jones and\nreferring to Johnson, so why opt for an ambiguity thesis when\ndescriptions are involved? It appears to be exactly the same\nphenomenon.\n\nOne of the advantages of employing the Gricean distinction between the\nproposition literally communicated and the proposition meant is that\nit offers an account for our being ambivalent about Donnellan\u2019s\n(1966) misdescription cases. In the courtroom case discussed above, I\nmight say \u201cSmith\u2019s murderer is insane,\u201d and still\nsay something true even if the crazy man at the defense table is\nentirely innocent of the charges and the actual murderer, who is miles\nfrom the courtroom, is quite sane. At the same time there is some pull\nto say that in such a case one is saying something false too. We can\nsay that this is a case where what we literally said was false, but\nthat what we intended to communicate\u2014the proposition\nmeant\u2014was true. The two-level theory thus accounts for our\nconflicting intuitions.\n\nSimilarly, Hornsby (1977) gave the case of my observing the man\nranting at the defense table and (me) saying, \u201cThe murderer of\nSmith is insane\u201d not realizing that the man at the table is both\ninnocent and quite sane, while the actual murderer is at large and\nquite insane. Again we are ambivalent about the truth of what I say,\nand as Neale (1990; 91\u201393) observed, the distinction between the\nproposition literally expressed and the proposition meant allows us to\nunderstand why. In this case, the proposition literally expressed is\ntrue, but what I intend to communicate is mistaken.\n\nUnfortunately, there are cases where the two-stage theory\ndoesn\u2019t appear to be sufficient. For example, there remains a\ndifficulty that Ludlow and Segal (2004) have called the residue of\nthe problem of misdescription. Consider a case where we are at\nthe crime scene, and unbeknownst to Detective Brown there is not one\nmurderer but several\u2014suppose there were several perpetrators and\nthey were all mad members of an evil cult. When Brown utters the\nsentence \u2018The murderer of Smith is insane\u2019 has he said\nsomething true or false? Again we are in two minds about the matter\nbut this time the distinction between what is literally said and what\nis meant is no help.\n",
