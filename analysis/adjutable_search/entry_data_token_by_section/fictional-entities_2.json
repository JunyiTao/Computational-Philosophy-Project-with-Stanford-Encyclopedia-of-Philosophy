    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Fictional Entities || Meinong and Neo-Meinongianism\n1.2 Meinong and Neo-Meinongianism\n\nAccording to possibilism (perhaps extended to allow some fictional\nobjects to be impossible objects), fictional objects are just like\nactual objects, except that they exist only in various non-actual\nworlds. Like actual objects, they are determinate down to the last\ndetail in worlds in which they exist (so long as the stories that\ncharacterize them represent the world as being determinate down to the\nlast detail). This is so even if the stories do not themselves fill in\nthese details. For example, in worlds in which the Holmes stories are\ntrue, Holmes is left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous, even\nthough the stories themselves do not tell us which (all that is true\nin the Holmes stories is that, having hands, he is\none of these).\n1.2.1 Meinong\u2019s theory of objects\n\nThe view that fictional objects are Meinongian objects\nconstitutes a very different metaphysical option. Meinong (1904)\nthought that among the entities that have some kind of being, there\nare real entities (entities with (spatio)temporal being\n\u2014 these can be physical or mental) and ideal entities\n(entities whose mode of being is non-temporal or abstract, such as\nnumbers and relations). In addition, there are the paradigmatic\nMeinongian objects that lack any kind of being, such as the golden\nmountain and the round square. Meinong himself used \u201c[mere]\nsubsistence\u201d (Bestand) for the non-temporal kind of\nbeing, reserving \u201cexistence\u201d (Existenz) for the\ntemporal kind. \u201cSein\u201d was his word for the most general\nkind of being, which includes both Bestand and\nExistenz, thus putting entities that do not have being in\neither sense outside the scope of Sein. To simplify\nterminological matters, unless we specify otherwise we will use\n\u201cexists\u201d for the most general mode of being, i.e.,\nMeinong\u2019s Sein. Meinong\u2019s view, then, is that\nthere are objects that have no form of existence, or being,\nwhatsoever.\n\nEven though Meinongian objects do not exist, they do have properties.\nIn particular, Meinong thought that their being such-and-so (their\nSosein) is independent of their being or Sein. These\nSosein-specifying properties, moreover, are precisely the\nproperties in terms of which the objects are descriptively given. This\nclaim is captured by the so-called Characterization\nPrinciple, whose explicit formulation is due to Routley (1980:\n46) but which is already implicit in Meinong 1904 (1960: 82).\nAccording to this Principle, objects, whether they exist or not, have\nthe properties in terms of which they are given or characterized;\nschematically, the thing that is characterized as being F is\nin fact F. Take, for instance, the golden mountain or the\nround square. The golden mountain does not exist, yet we can say that\nit is both golden and a mountain since these are the properties in\nterms of which the object is characterized; similarly, the round\nsquare is both round and square, even though it cannot\nexist.\n\nIt is commonly assumed that for Meinong fictional objects are just a\nsubset of his Meinongian objects\u2014they are Meinongian objects\nthat are given in terms of the properties they have in the stories\nthat feature them. Note that the problem for possibilism mentioned\ntowards the end of the last section disappears on this account. For,\nso conceived, fictional entities do in fact possess the properties in\nterms of which they are characterized in the relevant narratives:\nHolmes really does have a high degree of cleverness, higher, perhaps,\nthan that possessed by any actual detective, and so\n (1)\n might well be true. Note also that fictional entities so conceived\nare not completely determined with respect to their properties, unlike\nfictional entities conceived on the model of possibilism. Because\nConan Doyle\u2019s stories are quiet on these matters, Holmes on the\nMeinongian model is not right-handed; nor is he left-handed; nor is he\nambidextrous. He does, however, have the property of being one of\nthese. (One caution. Although this is the usual understanding of\nMeinong\u2019s conception of fictional objects, Meinong may not have\nendorsed it in precisely this form: his most complete account of\nfictional objects suggests that they are higher-order entities, that\nis, entities that are constructed out of simpler entities, in the same\nsense in which, for instance, a melody is an entity constructed out of\nits constituent sounds (cf. Raspa 2001 and Marek 2008 [2013]).\n1.2.2 Concrete and abstract neo-Meinongianism\n\nModern versions of Meinongianism accept much of what Meinong has to\nsay on the topic of nonexistent objects, but depart from his account\nat various points. Suppose we restrict our attention to properties\nappropriate to physical, spatiotemporal objects (for example,\nbeing a mountain or being a detective). What,\nfollowing Reicher (2023), we might call concrete\nneo-Meinongianism (Parsons 1980, Routley 1980, Jacquette 1996)\nmaintains that Meinongian objects characterized in terms of such\nproperties are concrete correlates of sets of such properties,\npossessing the properties in exactly the same sense as ordinary\nconcrete objects have properties. Corresponding to a set S of\nsuch properties, there is a concrete object that has (at least) the\nproperties contained in S. Corresponding to {being\ngolden, being a mountain}, for example, there is the\ngolden mountain, which has the properties of being a mountain\nand being golden (as well, perhaps, as all properties\nP such that necessarily, whatever is a golden mountain is\nP). These properties constitute the nature or essence of the\ngolden mountain. But the golden mountain also has other properties, in\nparticular properties that reflect its relationship to actual objects\nin the world (being often thought about by Meinong, for\nexample). Like Meinong himself, concrete Meinongians think that such\nobjects lack existence in the broad sense, i.e. the kind of existence\nappropriate to concrete or abstract objects. And while some are\nneutral on the question of whether there might be an even more\ninclusive mode of being possessed by nonexistent object (Parsons 1980:\n10), others are adamant that there is no such mode. Routley has the\nmost extreme version of this view; his \u201cnoneism\u201d holds\nthat the only mode of being is existence narrowly construed as the\npossession of causal powers and/or spatiotemporal location, a view\nshared by Priest\u2019s version of Modal Meinongianism (Priest 2005,\n2016). (Against such a Routley-style concrete neo-Meinongianism, David\nLewis has famously argued that we should repudiate any understanding\nof existence on which \u201c it can be a substantive thesis that only\nsome of the things there are exist\u2014or, for that matter, \u2026\na substantive thesis that everything exists\u201d (Lewis 1990:\n32).\n\nConcrete neo-Meinongians claim that fictional objects can similarly be\nregarded as concrete correlates of sets of properties. Consider\nHolmes, a cocaine-addicted detective who lives (lived) in London at\n221B Baker Street, solves many baffling crimes, has a friend called\n\u201cWatson\u201d, and so on (where the \u201cand so on\u201d\nincludes all the properties P such that it is true in the\nHolmes stories that Holmes has P). For concrete\nneo-Meinongians, Holmes is a concrete, albeit nonexistent, correlate\nof the set having those properties as members. (An interesting variant\nof these neo-Meinongian views is Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s\nguise-theory, according to which an existent individual is a bundle of\nguises\u2014particulars formed from sets of properties by a\nspecial concretizing operation\u2014related by a relation of\nconsubstantiation. An object like the golden mountain is a\nguise that is not consubstantiated with any guise, not even itself,\nand so doesn\u2019t exist. Casta\u00f1eda takes fictional objects\nto be bundles of guises related by a special relation of\nconsociation; see Casta\u00f1eda 1989: ch.11.)\n\nWhile agreeing that fictional objects form a subset of Meinongian\nobjects, abstract neo-Meinongians (the label is again from\nReicher 2023) maintain that Meinongian objects in general should be\nconceived of as objects that have a non-spatiotemporal mode of\nexistence, and hence as abstract rather than concrete (see especially\nZalta 1983)). And while they agree with the idea that for any\ncollection of properties there is an individual that has all these\nproperties, they do not take Meinongian objects to be correlates of\nsets of properties in anything like the way described by concrete\nneo-Meinongians. Instead, they take them to be something like generic\nobjects or roles, along the model of Platonic attributes. (Indeed,\nZalta and others have used his theory to model a range of\nphilosophical notions, including Platonic forms; see Zalta 1983:\n41\u20137, and Pelletier & Zalta 2000.) Consider the golden\nmountain again. For abstract neo-Meinongians, this object is not a\nmountain in the same sense that Mt Taranaki, for example, is a\nmountain. The golden mountain is an abstract object, and mountains are\nnot abstract objects. It is more akin to the object referred to as the\nU.S. President in the following statement:\n\n(3) The US\nPresident faces an election every four years,\n\n\nwhere the subject is not a particular US President like George W. Bush\nor Barack Obama, but rather the role or office of US President. (While\nZalta is the clearest example of an abstract neo-Meinongian in our\nsense, others come close. For example, Rapaport (1978) considers\nM-objects (his version of Meinongian objects) to be akin to\nplans rather than concrete individuals, and plans are presumably\nabstract objects.) Note finally that while abstract neo-Meinongians\ntake Meinongian objects like the golden mountain and Sherlock Holmes\nto exist in the broad sense, they agree on the importance of the\nnonexistence datum: Zalta, for example, emphasizes that while\nHolmes has being, i.e., existence in the broad sense, \u2018he\u2019\nlacks existence in the narrow, more salient, sense of having\nspatiotemporal location (Zalta 1988: 21).\n\nThere are other realist positions which, although admittedly not\nMeinongian, come close to this abstract form of neo-Meinongianism. The\nrealist view of Wolterstorff (1980), for example, takes fictional\nobjects to be Platonic kinds whose instances or examples are ordinary\nobjects that have properties like being a famous detective, living in\nLondon, being called \u2018Holmes\u2019, etc. (in the case of the\nfictional object Holmes); it thereby shares with abstract\nneo-Meinongianism a form of Platonism about fictional objects. Others\ntake them to be work-bound roles (Currie 1990), thereby holding a form\nof abstractionism that leads to a conception of fictional objects as\ndependent entities, like the conception explicitly defended by\ncreationists (see below). (Indeed, even the idea of fictional objects\nas kinds can be given a creationist rather than Platonist\ninterpretation; see Terrone 2017, which interprets fictional objects\nas abstract types dependent on mental files.)\n\nBefore turning to another important point of disagreement among\nneo-Meinongians, it is worth emphasizing that abstract\nneo-Meinongianism should be considered an unorthodox variant of\nMeinongianism on the usual understanding of Meinong\u2019s view.\nAfter all, if Meinongian objects are abstract then they must all have\nSein or existence in the broad sense, contrary to what\nMeinong is generally taken to have thought. (There is some evidence,\nhowever, that Meinong later also contemplated a more Platonist way of\nunderstanding such objects, taking them to function as abstract\nuniversals that serve as \u201cauxiliary\u201d objects for the\ncomprehension of real objects, see Meinong (1915 [1972]: 739f.)\n1.2.3 Two kinds of properties vs. two modes of predication\n\nThe distinction between concrete and abstract neo-Meinongians is drawn\nat the metaphysical level. It is closely linked to another distinction\nrelevant to Meinongian objects, and so to fictional objects conceived\nof as Meinongian objects: that between kinds of properties and modes\nof predication. Recall that on the one hand it seems natural to say\nthat fictional objects have the properties in terms of which stories\ncharacterize them (for instance, Anna Karenina was a woman driven to\nsuicide by her failed affair, and Sherlock Holmes a cocaine-addicted\ndetective living in London), and on the other hand not in the least\nnatural (Anna Karenina may have committed suicide, but it is no use\nlooking for news of her suicide in the newspapers of the day). Now,\nall neo-Meinongians accept Meinong\u2019s view that a Meinongian\nobject possesses the properties in terms of which it is characterized.\nFollowing what Meinong (1972 [1915]) himself came to say on the basis\nof a suggestion by his student Ernst Mally, some neo-Meinongians (for\nexample, Parsons 1980, Jacquette 1996) take these properties to be the\nobject\u2019s nuclear properties, where, in general, if M is\nthe Meinongian object correlated with a set of properties S,\nthe members of S are the object\u2019s nuclear properties.\nOn this view, being a detective, for example, is a nuclear\nproperty of Holmes, while being a king is a nuclear property\nof King Arthur. (Routley similarly talks of an object\u2019s\ncharacterizing properties; cf. Routley 1980: 507\u201310.)\nBut a Meinongian object also has other properties on this view: its\nextranuclear properties are those of its properties that are\nnot among its nuclear or characterizing properties. In the case of\nfictional objects, these are the properties that a fictional object\nhas outside the scope of the story in which it\nappears\u2014properties, we might say, that it has in virtue of the\nway the world really is, not properties that it has from the\npoint of view of that story. Consider, for example, the following two\nsentences:\n\n(4) Mickey\nMouse is a pop culture icon\n(5) Anna\nKarenina is a fictional character.\n\n\nThese sentences involve properties\u2014being a pop culture\nicon, being a fictional character\u2014that are being\nascribed to Mickey Mouse and Anna Karenina even though the properties\ndo not characterize these characters in the stories in which they\nappear. Mickey Mouse has the first property because of the effects of\nhis enormous popularity on pop culture, not because he is depicted as\na pop culture icon in the Mickey Mouse stories. Anna Karenina has the\nsecond property because of her status as the product of creative\nfiction, not because of what Tolstoy\u2019s story says about her\n(according to Tolstoy\u2019s story she is a woman, not a fictional\ncharacter). These two properties are typical instances of extranuclear\nproperties.\n\n(A cautionary comment. In light of what we have just said, the claim\nthat the properties true of a fictional object in a work count as the\nobject\u2019s nuclear properties needs qualification. It is true in\nthe Holmes stories, for example, that Holmes exists, even though\nHolmes doesn\u2019t actually exist. So non-existence is one of\nHolmes\u2019s (extranuclear) properties despite the fact that in the\nstories Holmes is as much an existent object as he is a detective\nliving in London. One way of dealing with this apparent tension is to\ninsist that Holmes does have a property like existence, but that this\nproperty should be understood as a weaker, \u2018watered-down\u2019,\nversion of its extranuclear counterpart, a notion first advanced by\nMeinong (cf. Parsons 1980: 44, 184\u20136). We return to the notion\nof watered-down versions of extranuclear properties below.)\n\nSome other neo-Meinongians claim instead that fictional and other\nMeinongian objects possess the very same kind of properties that\nordinary individuals possess, but possess them in a very different\nway. (This suggestion was first made by Mally (1912), but not adopted\nby Meinong.) When, for example, we say that Anna Karenina was a woman\nand Holmes an inhabitant of London, we use a different mode of\npredication from the one we use when we say that Marilyn Monroe was a\nwoman or Tony Blair an inhabitant of London. On Zalta\u2019s familiar\nformulation of this idea (Zalta 1983), fictional entities\nencode such properties while ordinary individuals simply\nexemplify them. Similarly, Casta\u00f1eda (1989) appeals to\nan internal as well as external mode of predication\nof properties, while Rapaport (1978) talks of properties that are\nconstituents of objects and properties that are exemplified by\nobjects. Both Anna Karenina and Marilyn Monroe, we might say, have the\nproperty of being a woman, but the former encodes the\nproperty (the property is predicated of Anna internally, or Anna has\nit as a constituent), while the latter exemplifies the property (she\nhas it externally).\n\nBut fictional objects also exemplify properties, perhaps some of the\nvery same properties they encode or have internally (this happens\nwhenever these properties are predicated of the objects in the stories\nin which they appear). Thus, what makes both\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n true is that the properties of being a pop culture icon and\nbeing a fictional character are exemplified, or possessed\nexternally, by Mickey Mouse and Anna Karenina respectively. Anna\nKarenina therefore turns out to be internally non-fictional (since it\nis true in the novel that she is a woman, not a fictional character),\nand externally fictional.\n\nThat said, note that there are important differences between the ways\nin which Zalta, on the one hand, and Casta\u00f1eda and Rapaport, on\nthe other, formulate these distinctions. For Zalta (1983: 12),\nencoding is a primitive notion that he embeds in a rigorous\nhigher-order modal theory which is then used to prove the existence,\nand derive the properties, of abstract objects, including fictional\nobjects. The fact that encoding is a primitive notion is not seen as a\ndrawback, given the fruitfulness of the notion once embedded in a\ngeneral theory of abstract objects (Bueno & Zalta 2017). For both\nCasta\u00f1eda (1989: 200) and Rapaport (1978: 162), on the other\nhand, internal predication applies to set-correlates, and so this mode\nof predication can be defined in terms of set-membership: a\n(fictional) entity F has P internally (or: has\nP as a constituent) if and only if P belongs to the\nproperty set that is correlated with F.\n\nOn the surface, the \u2018modes of predication\u2019 distinction\nappears to be in a better position to handle the data than the\n\u2018kinds of properties\u2019 distinction (for more on these\ndistinctions, see the exchange between Jacquette (1989) and Zalta\n(1992)). For one thing, there seems to be no workable criterion for\ndistinguishing nuclear and extranuclear properties: some properties\nseem to be both. Consider the property of being a fictional\ncharacter. Being a fictional character may seem to be\nthe prototypical candidate of an extranuclear property, as the case of\n(5) above testifies, but there may well be \u2018metafictional\u2019\nnarratives whose protagonists are not characterized in the usual way\nas flesh and blood individuals, but instead as fictional characters.\n(The fictional character The Father in Pirandello\u2019s Six\nCharacters in Search of an Author is a famous case in point.) So\nbeing a fictional character seems to qualify as both a\nnuclear and an extranuclear property. Defenders of the \u2018modes of\npredication\u2019 distinction have no problem here: they hold that we\ncan externally predicate being a fictional character\nof both Anna Karenina and Pirandello\u2019s The Father, while we can\nalso internally predicate this property of The Father. (It\nshould be pointed out that defenders of the \u2018kinds of\nproperties\u2019-distinction have their own way of responding to this\nproblem: they say that in such cases the nuclear property in question\nis the \u2018watered-down\u2019 counterpart of the corresponding\nextranuclear property. On this view, Pirandello\u2019s The Father has\nthe extranuclear property of being a fictional character as\nwell as its nuclear \u2018watered-down\u2019 correlate. But apart\nfrom the seemingly ad hoc character of this response, it is\nfaced by a more serious problem: it threatens to expose the\ndistinction to an endless regress of ever more \u2018watered-\ndown\u2019 nuclear properties (cf. Voltolini 2006).)\n\nIt is probably fair to say that at the current stage of the debate the\n\u2018modes of predication\u2019 distinction is more widely\naccepted, although as far as fictional entities at least are\nconcerned, both distinctions are taken to be problematic (Everett\n2013). We should remember, however, that this debate is internal to\nneo-Meinongianism, and that neo-Meinongianism as a theory of fictional\nobjects has important virtues that owe nothing to the outcome of this\ndebate. One such virtue is that the theory can account for the idea\nthat fictional entities necessarily have the properties that\nthey are characterized as having in the relevant stories. It is hard\nto see how Holmes could not have been a detective, for\nexample. Of course, Doyle might have written a story in which someone\ncalled \u2018Holmes\u2019 was a film director, but it is hard not to\ninterpret this thought as simply meaning that Doyle might have created\nanother character with the same name. At the same time, it is a plain\ntruth of the Holmes stories that Holmes might never have become a\ndetective, that this was a purely contingent choice on Holmes\u2019s\npart. No matter how it is formulated, neo-Meinongianism has a way of\ncapturing both these intuitions. On Zalta\u2019s formulation of the\n\u2018modes of predication\u2019 distinction, for example, Holmes\nexemplifies the property of being necessarily such that he encodes\nboth being a detective and being someone who might not have been a\ndetective. A neo-Meinongian advocating the \u2018types of\nproperty\u2019 distinction would say that Holmes has the extranuclear\nproperty of being necessarily such that he has the (nuclear)\nproperty of being a detective, but that he also has the\n(watered-down) nuclear property of being someone who might not\nhave been a detective.\n\nOn the basis of the essentialist idea that fictional objects\nnecessarily have the properties that they are characterized as having\nin the relevant stories, neo-Meinongians have suggested a simple\ncriterion for the identity of fictional entities, one which can be\ntraced back to the criterion for the identity of Meinongian objects in\ngeneral: If x has all the same nuclear properties as\ny (alternatively, if x and y internally\npossess the same properties), then \\(x = y\\) (cf., for example,\nParsons 1980: 28, 188).\n\nDespite the apparent attractions of such a view, there is an evident\nproblem facing the underlying thought that once you have a certain\ncollection of properties you ipso facto have a fictional\nentity. (Note that (most) neo-Meinongians accept this thought, since\nthey take fictional objects to be a subset of the class of objects\ngenerated on the basis of something like Meinong\u2019s Principle of\nthe Freedom of Assumption (cf. Meinong 1915 [1972: 282]), the\nprinciple that for any collection of (nuclear) properties there is a\nMeinongian object that has those properties.) But generating fictional\nentities is surely not quite that easy. Take an arbitrary\ncollection of properties, say {weighing more than 10kgs,\nbearing the name \u201cOscar\u201d, having a passion\nfor garden gloves, being a devotee of the number 17}.\nThe mere existence of this set of properties is not enough to generate\na fictional object, Oscar, with these properties. More has to happen.\n(Kripke (2013: 70\u20131) mentions the historical case of the\nBiblical term \u2018Moloch\u2019, which interpreters of the Bible\ntook to be a name for a mythical pagan god, whereas modern philology\nsuggests it was in fact used as a common noun either for kings or for\nhuman sacrifices. If modern philology is right and Bible-interpreters\nwere confused, there is no mythical god Moloch. This is so even though\nwe can agree that there is a collection of properties that past\ninterpreters mistakenly understood the Bible to assign to such a\ngod.)\n\nNeo-Meinongians have tried to circumvent this problem by stressing\nthat Meinongian objects, including fictional objects, are not sets of\nproperties, but correlates of such sets. Whether this move\nenables neo-Meinongians to avoid admitting objects like Oscar and\nMoloch into the overall domain of fictional objects will depend on how\nthis move is understood. (In Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s variant of\nneo-Meinongianism, fictional objects are systems of set-correlates,\nbuilt up, or put together, by a fiction maker (cf. Casta\u00f1eda\n1989: ch.11). But if this implies that the activity of fiction-making\nis essential to the identity of fictional objects, we no longer have a\npure neo-Meinongianism but a view that is closer to the\n\u2018creationist\u2019 view described in the next section.)\n\nEven if the idea of a set-correlate helps to solve this particular\nproblem, it seems that no neo-Meinongian theory is able to block\nanother problem that stems from letting the identity of such an object\ndepend on the properties in terms of which it is characterized. Take\nJorge Luis Borges\u2019s famous story of a man called Pierre Menard\nwho happens to write a text that is word for word identical with\nMiguel Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote. Assume, in this variant\nof Borges\u2019s story, that Menard and Cervantes are unknown to each\nother, even though they live in the very same town; one can even\nsuppose that they are neighbors. In that case, the Borges story\ndescribes a situation in which one and the same set of properties\ncorresponds to different fictional objects: Cervantes\u2019s Don\nQuixote and Pierre Menard\u2019s Don Quixote are two distinct\nfictional characters who, nonetheless, share all the properties they\nhave in the respective works. (The \u2018Menard\u2019 case was first\nmentioned in this context by Lewis (1978: 39). As a problem for the\nidentity of fictional objects, it was then exploited by Fine (1982:\n107); see also Thomasson (1999: 7, 56).) In this case, claiming that\nfictional objects are set-correlates rather than mere property sets\ndoes not solve the problem, for we have only one set-correlate, yet\ntwo distinct objects.\n\nIntuitively speaking, the problem is clear. Neo-Meinongianism in all\nits varieties tends to sketch a Platonistic picture of a fictional\nentity, either as something akin to a Platonic attribute, or as a\ncorrelate of something else that we tend to describe in Platonic\nterms\u2014a set of properties. Neo-Meinongianism thus sees a\nfictional object as something that pre-dates the story-telling\nactivities that intuitively bring fictional objects into being. To see\nthe tension between these conceptions, note that we often speak of\nfictional objects as the creations of storytellers or of the\nhuman mind more generally. Neo-Meinongianism, so it seems, leaves no\nsuch room for storytellers.\n1.3 Creationism\n\nThe intuition that story-tellers have some kind of creative role to\nplay is accounted for by so called artifactualist, or\ncreationist, accounts of fictional entities (see Searle 1979,\nSalmon 1998, Thomasson 1999, Voltolini 2006; the position was also\ndefended in Kripke 2013, and elements of the position are found in van\nInwagen\u2019s (1977) theory of fictional objects as posits of\nliterary criticism; Ingarden 1931 is a significant historical\nforerunner). According to such accounts, fictional objects are\nartifacts since they come into being once they are conceived by their\nauthors; to that extent, they are authorial creations. Moreover, they\nare abstract entities, just as abstract neo-Meinongians believe.\nUnlike Platonic abstracta, however, they not only have a\nbeginning in time, but they are also dependent entities since\nthey depend on other entities for their existence. (Roughly speaking,\nan entity O existentially depends on another entity\nO\u2032 just if O couldn\u2019t exist without\nO\u2032 existing (cf. Thomasson 1999). For a more\ndiscriminating account, one that avoids the consequence that\neverything existentially depends on necessary existents like natural\nnumbers, see Fine 1994.) More specifically, fictional objects depend\nhistorically rigidly on the authors who create them (necessarily, if\nO comes into being at t, then the author(s) who\ncreates O exists at some time t\u2032 before\nt) and constantly generically on the literary works that\nfeature them (necessarily, if O goes on existing, then some\nliterary work W or other featuring O exists during\nO\u2019s time of existence) (see Thomasson 1999 for an\nextended discussion of such dependencies). While historical rigid\ndependence accounts for a fictional object\u2019s coming into being,\nconstant generic dependence accounts for its continued existence or\npersistence. Such an account of the persistence of fictional objects\nseems as intuitive as the account of their generation. Not only do we\nsay that some given fictional object was created at a certain point of\ntime, but we might also describe it as having a certain age\n(Hamlet, we might point out, is now over 400 years old).\n\nNote that creationism thus characterized earns its keep from the\n\u2018obviousness\u2019 of the thought that authors somehow create\nfictional characters through the creation of fictional works in which\nthey appear. Language seems to support this thought: we routinely hear\nstatements like \u201cHamlet is one of Shakespeare\u2019s most\ncomplex creations\u201d. It is on the basis of this thought that\ncreationists then hypothesize that fictional objects literally are the\ncreations of their authors: not concrete creations, clearly, so\ntherefore non-concrete, abstract creations. But this move is far from\ninnocent. Yagisawa (2001), for example, argues that creationism\nconflicts sharply with other seemingly obvious thoughts, for example\nthe nonexistence datum that fictional characters like Hamlet\ndon\u2019t exist (for a response, see Goodman 2004). At an even more\nfundamental level, Brock (2010) argues that the creationist\u2019s\nappeal to creation is explanatorily void, leaving more questions than\nanswers. Not only is it left unclear when a fictional object\nis created, but also how it is created. Appealing to\nauthorial intentions, for example, is inadequate, for such intentions\nmay be lacking or overridden. (Brock considers an imaginary scenario\nin which Doyle intended Holmes and Watson to be the same character,\nbut died before writing the story that revealed this (361\u2013362).\nArguably, this wouldn\u2019t change the fact that Holmes is distinct\nfrom Watson.) Some creationists have responded to such cases by\narguing for models of creation on which the creation of fictional\nobjects may be inadvertent, perhaps because of the role played by\nreaders or because of authorial confusion. (Lee 2022, Zvolenszky\n2016).\n\nCreationists themselves claim that the appeal to creation does solve a\nnumber of significant problems that afflict other metaphysical\ntheories. There is, for example, no mythical god Moloch, for nobody\nhas created such an object by gathering various properties and\nembedding them in a certain narrative. And although they share all the\nproperties attributed to them in the respective renditions of Don\nQuixote, there are two Don Quixotes, Cervantes\u2019s\nand Menard\u2019s, not just one, because there were two utterly\nindependent acts of authorial generation (cf. Voltolini 2006: 32ff.).\nIt is not clear, however, how creationists can deal with a related\nproblem that affects their theory, the problem of indiscriminable\nfictional objects (Everett 2013: 191ff., Kroon 2015). Intuitively,\nthere were thousands of fictional dwarves who took part in\nTolkien\u2019s War between the Dwarves and Orcs, without\nTolkien\u2019s engaging in thousands of acts of dwarf-creation. (In\nresponse to this worry, some creationists have denied that there are\nsuch characters; see, for example, Voltolini 2006: 209\u201311,\nSchnieder & von Solodkoff 2009: 147.)\n\nIt is evident, then, that creationism is not without its problems.\nPerhaps the most significant ones have to do with the nature of the\ncreative process and the relation between the creative process and the\nidentity of fictional objects. It seems, for example, that what comes\ninto existence on the above account of the generating process (which\ntalks of authors\u2019 conceiving of their literary creations) is not\na fictional object as such, but rather a (mere) intentional object,\nthe target of a certain authorial thought. A mere intentional object\nis not yet a fictional object, as Thomasson (1999:89) agrees, so what\nmakes it one? Does it become one by being able to be\n\u2018shared\u2019 by more than one person through appearing in a\ntext (maybe not a physical copy but one stored in memory)? Or is there\na more discriminating criterion to single out which intentional\nobjects are fictional objects?\n\nThis question is perhaps best answered by giving a somewhat different\naccount of the generating process. Thus, some creationists (Schiffer\n1996, 2003; Thomasson 2003a,b) say that a fictional object comes into\nbeing as an abstract artifact not when an author first conceives of\nit, but only once a certain make-believe process has come to an end,\nnamely, the process in which someone\u2014typically, a\nstory-teller\u2014pretends that there is an individual who is\nsuch-and-such and does so-and-so. It is disputable whether this\nprovides a sufficient condition for ficta generation; perhaps\nsomething else is needed, such as a reflexive stance on the very\nmake-believe process itself (Voltolini 2006, 2015a, 2020a).\n\nCreationists may even choose to downplay the issue of ficta\ngeneration. Fictional objects can perhaps be construed as\ninstitutional entities along the model of baptisms and marriages,\nentities that figure in the general inventory of what there is, but do\nso for free. Just as one can allow for the existence of baptisms and\nmarriages simply by appealing to constitutive rules along the model of\nSearle\u2019s (1969) account of illocutionary acts, so one can say\nthat fictional objects come to exist once certain practices having do\nwith make-believe (and possibly also its recognition) are in force\n(Thomasson 2003a,b, 2014; Voltolini 2020b). Alternatively, one may\nappeal to regulative rules and say that, just like driving or\nqueueing, fiction requires an equilibrium solution to a coordination\nproblem in the communication, among consumers of fiction, of the\ncontent of their imaginings. Fictional objects arguably provide\nstability in such imaginings. On this picture, fictional objects,\nqua institutional entities, are simply generated by the fact\nthat giving expression to such imaginings also counts as declaring\nthat things stand in a certain way, thereby constituting the very fact\nthey declare, much like standard declarations such as a declaration of\nmarriage (Abell 2020). (It is of course important for this view to\njustify how the use of language resulting in ficta generation\ncan count as authoritative in the very same sense as the words of an\nofficer declaring, and thereby generating, a marriage.)\n\nBut whatever the right account, another question remains: even if we\nagree on the nature of the process-type that gives rise to a fictional\nobject, what is the thing that is purportedly generated in\nthis way? What are the identity conditions for fictional objects?\nCreationists typically do not think that a fictional object possesses\nthe properties that characterize it in the story in which it appears.\nA fictional object simply has those properties according to the\nstory. It is not true of Holmes, for instance, that\n\u2018he\u2019 (or it) is a detective\u2014only physical objects,\nnot an abstract artifact, can be a detective. In Williamson\u2019s\nterms (2000: 203), it is not true that Holmes, as a cultural artifact,\nis a detective that is fictional. Instead, what is true of Holmes is\nthat \u2018he\u2019 is a detective according to the Holmes stories\n(equally, Holmes is male according to those stories, and so deserving\nof the masculine pronoun \u201che\u201d). In general, for\ncreationists the only properties that fictional objects genuinely\npossess are the properties that neo-Meinongians would call\nextranuclear or take to be externally predicated: properties like\nbeing a fictional detective or being Doyle\u2019s\ncreation or even being a detective according to the Holmes\nstories (cf. Thomasson 1999). The approach thus fails to account\nfor the idea, mentioned earlier, that there must be a sense in which\nfictional objects actually have the properties that\ncharacterize them in the relevant stories.\n\nIn addition, the restricted nature of such properties makes it hard to\nsee how to individuate a fictional entity. Thomasson gives sufficient\nidentity conditions for fictional entities within a literary\nwork: x and y are the same fictional object\nF if x and y are ascribed exactly the same\nproperties in the work (1999: 63). But what do we say in the case of\nfictional objects that appear in different works? Thomasson admits\nthat in this case one can only provide a necessary condition:\nx and y are the same fictional object only if the\nauthor of the second work \\(W'\\) is competently acquainted with\nx of the previous work \\(W\\), and intends to import\nx into \\(W'\\) as y (1999: 67). The reason why she\nthinks this cannot be a sufficient condition is that, no matter what\nthe author\u2019s intentions are, he does not succeed in importing\nx (an entity that appears in W) into \\(W'\\) as\ny if he attributes properties to y that are too\nradically different from the properties that were attributed to\nx in W (1999: 68). (There are other cases that show\neven more clearly how authorial intention can be thwarted. Thus,\nconsider a case of a fusion of characters, in which an author\nintends to import into \\(W'\\) two characters x and\ny from a previous work W as a single character\nz. Clearly, given the transitivity of identity, z is\nnot identical with either x or y, so the author\nfails in her attempt. Analogous problems arise in the converse\nsituation of character fission: cf. Voltolini 2012.)\n\nThe problem of the reliability of authorial intentions also arises in\nanother account, close to creationism, that has recently been\ndeveloped: the hylomorphist account (Evnine 2016). Just as ordinary\nartifacts (chairs, tables, statues ...) amount to the particular\narrangements of certain materials in accordance with certain creative\nintentions, so fictional objects come into play by arranging material\nof a specific kind, viz., the properties predicated in a certain\nfiction, in accordance with certain authorial intentions. On this\nmodel, fictional objects have their characterizing properties, albeit\nmerely contingently (the authorial plan may change). Once again,\nhowever, what specific authorial intention is in play and how it may\nbe put into force is a matter of debate. As before, there may be no\ncreative intention, or it may be overridden (to come back to a\nprevious example, few would take Holmes to be assembled out of\nproperties that include being identical to Watson, even if\nConan Doyle had, perversely, intended this).\n\nTo conclude this discussion of the metaphysics of fictional objects,\nit is worth noting that neo-Meinongian and creationist theories seem\nto suffer from complementary defects. On the one hand, neo-Meinongians\nprovide exact identity criteria for fictional objects, but these\ncriteria are clearly insufficient in that they do not take into\naccount the fact that such objects are products of the human mind. On\nthe other hand, creationists do account for this fact, but they only\nprovide relatively non-specific identity criteria for such entities.\nThose theories are normally taken to be incompatible, for they appeal\nto different metaphysical models\u2014broadly speaking, a Platonic\nmodel as opposed to a constructivist one. This claim of\nincompatibility should not be taken as definitive, however; there may\nwell be ways in which the two theories, or perhaps the most promising\nelements of each theory, can somehow be combined (for recent attempts\nto go in such a direction, cf. Zalta 2000, Voltolini 2006).\n2. The Ontology of Fictional Entities\n\nThe metaphysical question about fictional entities asked what such\nentities are like, should there be any. We now turn to the ontological\nquestion, which simply asks whether there are any such entities.\n2.1 Semantical Arguments for and Against Realism\n\nObviously the important division at the ontological level lies between\nthose who believe that there are fictional\nentities\u2014fictional realists\u2014and those who believe\nthat there are no such entities\u2014fictional antirealists.\nFor a long time, the battlefield between those two parties has been\nordinary language. Realists have always been fascinated by the fact\nthat there are sentences in language that seem to commit one to\nfictional entities. Antirealists have instead insisted that such\nappearances are deceptive: whenever a sentence seems to commit one to\nfictional entities, one can always provide a paraphrase which has the\nsame truth-conditions as the original sentence but is not so\ncommitted. Realists in turn try to show either that those paraphrases\nare inadequate or that there are still further sentences for which no\nadequate paraphrases can be found. Antirealists will reply that,\ndespite appearances, these sentences can also be paraphrased in\nnoncommittal terms; and so the game goes on.\n2.1.1 Russell\u2019s anti-realism\n\nFrege (1892) is often taken to be the first champion of fictional\nantirealism within analytic philosophy, in so far as he held that in\ndirect (gerade) contexts such as \u201cOdysseus came\nashore\u201d the fictional name \u201cOdysseus\u201d has a sense\nbut no reference. But Frege also held that in oblique\n(ungerade) contexts such as \u201cJohn believed that\nOdysseus came ashore\u201d and \u201cThe author of the\nOdyssey says that Odysseus came ashore\u201d this sense\nbecomes the new referent of the fictional name. If senses of this type\ncan model the notion of a fictional entity, then Frege can be\nconstrued as a kind of fictional realist (K\u00fcnne 1990); otherwise,\nhe can\u2019t. (Parsons (1982) is doubtful; Zalta may be more\nsympathetic, since he thinks his abstract objects can model both the\nnotion of sense (Zalta 2001) and the idea of a fictional object.)\n\nThe modern form of the realism-antirealism debate, however, did not\noriginate with anything Frege said on the matter, but with a dispute\nbetween Meinong (1904) and Russell (1905a). Consider a sentence\nlike:\n\n(6) Apollo is\nyoung.\n\n\nAccording to Meinong, considered here as the paradigmatic realist, the\nvery meaningfulness of this statement commits one to a (broadly)\nfictional entity\u2014the deity of the Greek myths\u2014on the\ngrounds, roughly, that the thought expressed by the statement is\ndirected at this entity, and so requires there to be such an entity.\nThe statement itself expresses a truth rather than a falsehood about\nthis entity. For Russell, however, appearances in this case were\ndeceptive. First of all, he thought that \u201cApollo\u201d, like\nany other ordinary proper name, is short-hand for a definite\ndescription\u2014say, \u201cthe sun-god\u201d. Secondly, following\nhis discovery of the theory of definite descriptions Russell held that\na sentence containing a definite description has to be analyzed in\nterms of another sentence in which the description is eliminated in\nfavor of quantifiers, predicates, logical connectives, and genuine\nproper names. What (6) says on this account is given by a paraphrase\nin which the definite description for which \u201cApollo\u201d is\nshort-hand, namely \u201cthe sun-god\u201d, has disappeared on\nanalysis:\n\n(6R) There is\nat least one sun-god and at most one sun-god and every sun-god is\nyoung.\n\n\n(Put more simply: There is a unique sun-god, and he is young.)\n\nThirdly, there is no longer even the appearance of a singular term\n(\u201cApollo\u201d) that must designate something for the\nparaphrase to be meaningful. In fact, Russell saw that this result\nshowed the original statement to be both meaningful (because able to\nbe analyzed in this way) and false (given obvious facts). Say that a\ndefinite description has a Russellian denotation when the\nRussellian conditions for the description to have a denotation are\nfulfilled; that is, when there is at least one individual satisfying\nthe relevant predicate, but no more than one. Then we can say that the\ndefinite description for which \u201cApollo\u201d is short-hand does\nnot have a Russellian denotation since (6R)\u2019s first conjunct,\nnamely:\n\n(7) There is\nat least one sun-god\n\n\nis false. Far from making\n (6)\n meaningless, the absence of a denotation in this Russellian sense\nwhen taken in conjunction with Russell\u2019s eliminative strategy\nshows (6) to be false. Russell thought that his theory of definite\ndescriptions allowed him to show that all fictional names lacked\ndenotation in this way, and that sentences containing fictional names\nwere therefore true or false rather than meaningless.\n2.1.2 Metafictional sentences and \u201cin the fiction\u201d operators\n\nLet us accept, for argument\u2019s sake, that the adoption of\nRussell\u2019s theory of descriptions allows us to avoid ontological\ncommitment to such \u2018bizarre\u2019 entities as nonexistent\nfictional and mythological entities. (Although this is a widely\naccepted view, there is in fact reason to doubt it: David Kaplan\nargues that it is \u201cone of [the] virtues\u201d of\nRussell\u2019s theory that the theory is \u201cessentially neutral\nwith respect to ontological commitment\u201d, that it permits\ndescriptions to denote nonexistent entities if there are such entities\n(Kaplan 2005: 975\u20136; cf. also Voltolini 2006: 139ff.). Even if\nRussell\u2019s theory is ontologically potent in this way, however,\nthe theory as formulated faces a simple and seemingly devastating\nobjection: many intuitively true sentences come out as false\non their Russellian paraphrases. Consider sentence\n (6)\n again. If we use Russell\u2019s theory to dispense with an entity\nlike Apollo, it follows that (6) is false, insofar as its Russellian\nparaphrase is false. This is widely acknowledged to be\ncounterintuitive. Presented with (6), most would say that it is\nintuitively true, unlike, say:\n\n(8) Apollo is\na rock-star.\n\n\nAs it turns out, the antirealist who follows Russell has an easy way\nof circumventing this problem. She will point out that the reason why\n (6),\n but not (8), seems to be true is that in the Greek myth\nthings are exactly as (6) says. The impression that (6) is true can\nthen easily be accommodated by taking (6) to be elliptical for a\nlonger sentence, namely:\n\n(6I)\nAccording to the Greek myth, Apollo is young.\n\n\nHere the locution \u201caccording to the Greek myth\u201d works as\nan intensional operator, whereas the sentence following that operator,\nwhich is nothing but (6) itself, has to be analyzed in Russellian\nfashion:\n\n(6IR)\nAccording to the Greek myth, there is a unique sun-god and he is\nyoung.\n\n\n(A caveat. It would be more proper to say that it is a use of\n (6)\n that is taken to be elliptical for (6IR), rather than (6) itself. For\n(6) is a case of a fictional sentence, namely a sentence that\ncould easily occur in the body of a narrative (a myth, in this case).\nSuch sentences have a use on which they have merely fictional\ntruth-conditions, that is, truth-conditions from the stand-point of\nthe narrative or work of fiction, and on this kind of use even their\ntruth-values are merely fictional. Following Evans (1982), who here\nborrows a Quinean terminology, we may call this the conniving\nuse of such sentences: the use on which the utterer is engaged in\npretense or make-believe. But there is another use of the same\nsentences\u2014what Evans calls the non-conniving\nuse\u2014on which we take them to have real truth-conditions, hence\nreal truth-values: the kind of use on which we take\n (8),\n unlike (6), to express a real falsehood. A case in point would be an\nutterance of (8) in response to a request for information about Apollo\nin an exam on Greek mythology. We shall call sentences of the form\n (6I),\n even reshaped as (6IR), internal metafictional sentences,\nfor they purport to say how things stand in, or according to, a\ncertain fiction. They are meant as sentences that capture the\nnon-conniving use of fictional sentences like (6).)\n\nLet us now go back to the amendment to Russellianism we were\nconsidering. On the view being discussed, an expression like\n\u201caccording to the Greek myth\u201d is, qua intensional\noperator, a circumstance-shifting operator, one that shifts the\ncircumstance of evaluation of the sentence following it. Suppose, for\nthe sake of argument, that a sentence of the form \u201cAccording to\nstory S, p\u201d is true in the actual world if and\nonly if \u201cp\u201d is true at the closest possible\nworlds to the actual world in which S is true (cf. Lewis\n1978). Now, any sentence that this operator embeds has to be analyzed\nin Russellian terms if it contains a singular term. In that case, a\nsentence like\n (6I)\n is true in the actual world if and only if\n (6),\n i.e.,\n (6R),\n is true at the closest possible worlds in which the Apollo-myth is\ntrue. Insofar as (6R) is indeed true at such worlds, the singular term\nin question\u2014\u201cApollo\u201d, that is, \u201cthe\nsun-god\u201d\u2014has a (Russellian) denotation in those worlds,\neven though it lacks a denotation in the actual world. Hence, we again\nget the result Russell desired: the whole sentence is true although\nthe relevant singular term has no actual denotation but only a\npossible one. Thus, no commitment to fictional entities arises out of\nthe truth of that sentence.\n\nOr rather, no such commitment arises from Russell\u2019s theory on\nits own. If we assume Lewis\u2019s modal realism, then saying as we\ndid that a description has a possible denotation entails an\nontological commitment to fictional objects as possibilia.\nNormally, however, this intensionalist approach is taken in an\nantirealist sense (cf., e.g., Lamarque & Olsen 1994; Orenstein\n2003; Rorty 1982). For the Russellian, central to this antirealist\nunderstanding is the fact that a sentence like\n (6I)\n should be given a de dicto, not a de re, reading:\nwhat is said to be true in the fiction is a certain dictum or\nproposition, not the claim, about some given thing or res\nx, that x has a certain property. On Russell\u2019s\nway of understanding this distinction, the description \u201cthe\nsun-god\u201d for which \u201cApollo\u201d is short-hand should be\ninterpreted as having a secondary, not a primary, occurrence in the\nsentence, or, which is the same, the existential quantifier occurring\nin the Russellian paraphrase of the sentence should be assigned\nnarrow, not wide, scope. (6I), that is, should be read as:\n\u201cAccording to the Apollo-myth, there is exactly one sun-god, and\nhe is young\u201d rather than as \u201cThere is a unique sun-god,\nand according to the myth he is young\u201d. The reason for this is\nevident. If we adopt the wide-scope reading of the quantifier, the\nsentence turns out to be false, not true (given that there is no\nsun-god); and it is the truth of a sentence like (6I) that the\nRussellian aims to capture.\n\nSuppose that the Russellian amendment works for fictional sentences on\ntheir non-conniving use. Intuitively, however, there are many\nsentences that talk of fictional characters even though they do not\neven implicitly mention stories. Let us call these\nexternal metafictional sentences (some other commentators\ntalk of \u201ctransfictive\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d\nsentences).\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n above are typical examples. Clearly, (4) and (5) cannot be taken as\nelliptical for internal metafictional sentences such as:\n\n(4I)\nAccording to the Disney stories, Mickey Mouse is a pop culture\nicon\n(5I)\nAccording to Anna Karenina, Anna Karenina is a fictional\ncharacter.\n\n\nFor unlike\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n the latter sentences are simply false even on their de dicto\nreading (a point already stressed by Lewis (1978: 38)): Mickey Mouse\nhas the status of a pop culture icon in the actual world, not in the\nDisney stories; and according to Anna Karenina, Anna is a\nwoman, not a fictional character. Many realists, especially\ncreationists, have concluded that sentences of this kind really do\nestablish that we are committed to fictional characters. They argue\nthat even though fictional sentences on their non-conniving use can be\nparaphrased as internal metafictional sentences on their de\ndicto reading and thus do not commit us to fictional characters,\nexternal metafictional sentences cannot be paraphrased in this way,\nand their truth really does commit us to fictional characters (see,\nfor example, Schiffer 1996 and Thomasson 2003b).\n\nOne possible antirealist solution to this problem\u2014although not\none that Russellians themselves have promoted\u2014is to invoke a\nkind of fictionalism about fictional characters. On this strategy,\nsentences like (4) and (5) should be thought of as implicitly prefixed\nby another intensional \u201cin the fiction\u201d operator,\nso that even in this case the impression of reference to a fictional\nentity would turn out to be baseless. In cases of this type, the\noperator would appeal not to a story but rather to the realist\npresumption that such an impression seems to support. The suggestion,\nthen, is that external metafictional sentences are to be read as\nimplicitly prefixed by an operator like \u201caccording to the\nfiction of realism\u201d or \u201caccording to the realist\u2019s\nhypothesis\u201d:\n\n(4F)\nAccording to the realist\u2019s hypothesis, Mickey Mouse is a pop\nculture icon.\n(5F)\nAccording to the realist\u2019s hypothesis, Anna Karenina is a\nfictional character.\n\n\nOnce external metafictional sentences are read this way, any apparent\ncommitment to fictional entities seems to disappear, provided once\nagain that the resulting complex sentences are read de dicto\n(for such a move, see Brock 2002, Phillips 2000).\n2.1.3 The descriptivist problem for theories of fictional names\n\nThe appeal to intensional \u201cin the fiction\u201d operators is a\nwell-known strategy for dealing with the apparent truth of statements\nlike\n (6),\n and because it is available to Russell this may seem like good news\nfor Russell\u2019s antirealism, especially given the way the strategy\nmight be extended to external meta-fictional statements like\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n But such an amended version of Russellianism faces a problem already\nfaced by the unamended version of Russell\u2019s view. If such a\nRussellianism is to provide the correct analysis of sentences like\n(6), one has to assume that proper names are synonymous with definite\ndescriptions. This is because the strategy used in arriving at a\nsentence like (6IR) involves replacing a proper name\n(\u201cApollo\u201d) with an equivalent definite description\n(\u201cthe sun-god\u201d). But there are well-known, and widely\naccepted, arguments against such a descriptivist view of proper names\n(Donnellan 1972, Kripke 1972 [1980], 2013). In particular,\ndescriptions of the sort that speakers or communities standardly\nassociate with a name might simply fail to fit what the name really\nrefers to (in the actual world and relative to other possible worlds).\nOne response to this objection as far as fictional names like\n\u201cApollo\u201d, \u201cHolmes\u201d, etc., are concerned is to\nreject descriptivism about ordinary names but endorse it for fictional\nnames (see, for example, Currie 1990: 158\u2013162). On the surface,\nhowever, this looks like an unpromising move: for one thing, it is\npossible to attempt to engage in conversation about Apollo, believing\nhe is real, before coming to the realization that he is merely a\nmythological figure, a possibility that is hard to explain if ordinary\nnames and fictional names have entirely different sorts of\nmeanings.\n\nThis descriptivist problem presents itself as a potential challenge to\nany antirealist view that endorses a de dicto reading of\nsentences like\n (6I)\n and\n (4F)\n /\n (5F).\n For how else, if not in terms of some kind of descriptivist view of\nnames like Russell\u2019s, are we to understand such de\ndicto readings? If names are instead taken to be directly\nreferential\u2014that is, if they are taken to be terms that do not\nsecure their reference by means of descriptive meanings\u2014there\nseems to be no room left for a de dicto as opposed to a\nde re reading of such sentences, and, consequently, no room\nfor the thought that sentences containing (allegedly) empty names like\n\u201cApollo\u201d even have truth-conditions.\n\nA particularly stark form of this dilemma is faced by what is perhaps\nthe most widely accepted post-Kripkean alternative to descriptivism,\nnamely Millianism, which holds that what a name contributes\nsemantically to the propositions expressed through the use of\nsentences containing the name is just the name\u2019s referent. The\ncombination of Millianism and the antirealist view that fictional\nnames like \u201cApollo\u201d lack reference (and so make no\ncontribution to the expression of propositions) appears to imply that\nsentences like\n (6I)\n don\u2019t express any proposition, let alone true propositions.\nThere is now a lively industry devoted to finding Millianism-friendly\nsolutions to this quandary. Some Millians argue that what we see as\nmeaningful and even true concerns what is implicated rather than\nsemantically expressed by such sentences (e.g., Taylor 2000). Others\nappeal to gappy or unfilled propositions. These are proposition-like\nentities expressed by sentences containing empty names that can fail\nto be true because of the gaps (see Braun 1993, 2005; Adams et al.\n1997). Both Braun and Adams et al. argue that such gappiness\ndoesn\u2019t prevent internal metafictional sentences such as\n\u201cIn the Holmes stories, Holmes is a detective\u201d from\nexpressing truths. But they disagree about external metafictional\nsentences like \u201cHolmes is a fictional character\u201d, with\nAdams et al. insisting that these too can be true despite the names\nbeing non-referring, and Braun (2005) arguing that such statements\ncall for a creationist position on which the names in such sentences\nrefer to genuine, created fictional entities.\n\nMillians are not the only ones to have grappled with the implications\nthat the Kripke-Donnellan attack on descriptivism has for the\nsemantics of fictional names. Michael Devitt, for example, another\nearly critic of descriptivism, has used the problem of fictional and\nother empty names to argue against Millianism and in favor of his\nversion of a causal-historical theory of reference (cf. Devitt 1989).\nAnd Mark Sainsbury argues in Sainsbury 2005 that names, including\nfictional names, have singular but non-descriptive meanings that can\nbe specified in a Davidson-style truth theory whose background logic\nis a Negative Free Logic (that is, a logic that counts simple or\natomic sentences containing empty names as false). Given the role\nassigned to Negative Free Logic, it is scarcely surprising that the\ngreatest challenge for such a framework is again the problem of\nexternal metafictional sentences such as\n (4):\n\n(4) Mickey Mouse is a\npop culture icon.\n\n\nThe latter has the appearance of an atomic sentence and so should,\nimplausibly, count as false on such a logic. In (2009) and (2011),\nSainsbury uses the idea of presupposition- / acceptance-relative truth\nto deal with such problems, an idea that is related to ideas found in\nthe popular pretense-theoretic approach to fictional names. That is\nthe approach we turn to next.\n2.1.4 Pretense Theory\n\nFor the antirealist, the semantics of names presents an important\nhurdle to attempts to accommodate the truth of internal and external\nmetafictional sentences featuring fictional names. Such difficulties\nhave suggested the need to look in a completely different direction.\nAs we saw before, it is important to acknowledge the role of pretense\nin fictional talk and writing. A fictional sentence has a conniving\nuse when it is uttered within the context of a certain pretense\ninvolving the telling of a story. Call such a context a\nfictional context. Note that a sentence considered as uttered\nin such a context does in a sense carry ontological commitments: it\ncarries pretend ontological commitments. For within the\ncontext of the relevant pretense, the singular terms involved do refer\nto things. For instance, to utter\n (6)\n in the context of telling the Greek myth is to utter a sentence in\nwhich, from the perspective of the relevant pretense, the name\n\u201cApollo\u201d refers to a god. Consequently, the sentence has\nfictional truth-conditions in that context (the sentence is\ntrue in the world of that context just if the entity referred to as\n\u201cApollo\u201d in that context is young in that world) and has\nalso a fictional truth-value (considered as uttered in that\ncontext, the sentence is true, for in the world of that\ncontext\u2014the world of the Greek myth\u2014there is a god,\nApollo, who is indeed young). Outside that context,\nhowever\u2014that is, in a real context where there is no\npretense that the Greek myth is fact\u2014a name like\n\u201cApollo\u201d refers to nothing. No endorsement of\ndescriptivism is here required. Quite simply, if the singular terms in\nquestion are directly referential (currently the most popular view of\nnames), then a sentence containing a fictional proper name\nwill have no real truth-conditions, hence no real truth-value, since\nany such term is really empty. Take the case of \u201cApollo\u201d,\nwhich on this view has no referent when uttered in a real,\nnon-fictional context of utterance. Assuming it is a directly\nreferential term, it makes no truth-conditional contribution to\nsentences that contain it. Hence, when uttered in a real context (6)\nwill have no truth-conditions, hence no truth-value. (The kernel of\nthis proposal is in Walton 1990; see Recanati 2000 and Everett 2013\nfor refinements.)\n\nSo far, so good. Remember, however, that the intuition that a sentence\nlike\n (6)\n is really, not just fictionally, true\u2014hence, that it has real,\nnot just fictional, truth-conditions\u2014is a powerful one. How can\na pretense antirealist account for this intuition?\n\nAs a first attempt, a pretense antirealist may try to combine the\nvirtues of the pretense account with the virtues of the intensionalist\napproach. That is, she may first stick to the idea that on its\nnon-conniving use a sentence like (6) has to be taken as elliptical\nfor an internal metafictional sentence like\n (6I).\n But she may also insist that the \u201caccording to the story\u201d\noperator should be taken as a context-shifting operator, not\nsimply (like the familiar intensional operator \u201cIt is necessary\nthat\u201d) as a circumstance-shifting operator. That is, she may\ninsist that it is an operator that shifts not only the circumstances\nof evaluation of the sentence it embeds, but also the context relevant\nfor the interpretation of such sentence\u2014typically, the context\nof its utterance. More precisely, if we take a fictional sentence\n\u201cp\u201d on its non-conniving use as elliptical for\n\u201cAccording to the story S, p\u201d, then\n\u201cp\u201d so understood is true in the actual world if\nand only if \u201cp\u201d, taken as uttered in the context\nof the story S (that is, a fictional context), is true in the\nworld of that context.\n\nThe antirealist merits of this account are clear. It allows a proper\nname like \u201cApollo\u201d to be both genuinely empty, carrying no\ncommitment to any fictional entity, but also genuinely\nnon-descriptive. The embedded sentence containing the name ((6), say)\nis understood as being uttered in a fictional context, and in that\ncontext the name directly refers to an individual, the individual\nexisting in the world of the relevant pretense. Since this reference\noccurs only in that fictional context, not in a real context, the name\nreally does remain empty. (This proposal can be traced back to Walton\n1990; see also Adams et al. 1997.)\n\nDespite these virtues, the suggestion faces a well-known criticism.\nKaplan calls such context-shifting operators \u2018monsters\u2019,\nand claims that \u201cnone can be expressed in English (without\nsneaking in a quotation device)\u201d (1989a: 511). In the case of\nindexicals, for example, \u201cno operator can control \u2026 the\nindexicals within its scope, because they will simply leap out of its\nscope to the front of the operator\u201d (1989a: 510). To see how\nthis worry applies to a fictional sentence containing an indexical,\nconsider the famous first line of Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost\nTime:\n\n(9) For a long\ntime I used to go to bed early.\n\n\nWithin the fictional context mobilized by Proust\u2019s telling his\nstory, the first person pronoun \u201cI\u201d refers to the person\nnarrating the events that constitute the imaginary world of\nProust\u2019s Recherche\u2014an individual who exists only\nin that world, not the actual world. Now, suppose we want to capture\nthe sense in which (9) is really true by reporting that the claim\nexpressed by (9) is true according to In Search of Lost Time.\nOn the above pretense-intensionalist approach, we might formulate this\nsuggestion as:\n\n(9PI)\nAccording to In Search of Lost Time, for a long time I used\nto go to bed early.\n\n\nHowever, this equivalence clearly does not work. Assuming that you are\nthe person who utters (9PI), the sentence says that you used to go to\nbed early for a long time in the imaginary world of Proust\u2019s\nRecherche. But this is false, since you are not an inhabitant\nof this world.\n\nIt may be possible to obviate Kaplan\u2019s problem in some way, for\ninstance by claiming that the context-shift affects the whole\nsentence, not just the embedded one (Recanati 2000); but then one has\nto show how such sentences may nonetheless have real truth-conditions,\nand not merely fictional ones. Or the problem may turn out to be\nrestricted to the case of embedded indexicals, or even certain types\nof indexicals. Predelli, for example, has argued that there are\nexamples of discourse about fiction using modal and temporal\nindexicals that are best analyzed in terms of such context-shifting\nKaplanesque \u2018monsters\u2019 (Predelli 2008).\n\nBe that as it may, one might try to simplify the pretense-theoretical\nproposal by reversing the order of explanation. Rather than taking the\nfictional sentence on its non-conniving use as elliptical for an\ninternal metafictional sentence, we might take the internal\nmetafictional sentence to be really true just when the fictional\nsentence (on its non-conniving use) is really true. We might, that is,\nfollow Walton in treating the fictional sentence as\n\u201cprimary\u201d; cf. 1990: 401\u20132). It is in fact\nrelatively easy to discern the sense in which the fictional sentence\non its non-conniving use is really true. It is really true just in\ncase there is a pretense of a certain kind relative to which the\nsentence on its conniving use is fictionally true. In short, the\nfictional sentence is really true on its non-conniving use if and only\nif it is fictionally true (for this formulation, see Crimmins 1998:\n2\u20138). (Walton\u2019s 1990 own formulation of the point is\nweaker, for it gives the proposal a pragmatic twist: by being\nfictionally true, a sentence may be taken to assert, or to\nconvey, a real truth. See also Everett 2013.)\n\nOne advantage of such an antirealist move is that it can be used for\nboth fictional sentences and external metafictional sentences. For\nWalton, what distinguishes the two cases is simply the kind of\npretense that makes the relevant sentence fictionally true. In the\nformer case, the game of make-believe that the relevant fictional\ncontext singles out is an authorized one; that is, it is a\ngame authorized by what serves as a prop in that game (in the case of\na literary game of make-believe, the text written or narrated by the\nstoryteller); the prop dictates how things go in the world of that\ngame. In the latter case, the relevant game of make-believe is an\nunofficial, albeit standard, one (1990: 417); in this case,\nthere may be no constraints\u2014none, at least, provided by the\nprop\u2014that dictate how things stand in the world of that game\n(cf. Walton 1990: 51, 406, 409).\n\nTake (6) again. In order for (6) to be fictionally true, and hence for\nit to be really true on its non-conniving use, the world of the Greek\nmyth must contain a god (Apollo) who is young. This is a consequence\nof the fact that this is the way the myth is told. The myth-telling\nfunctions as a prop constraining how the \u201cApollo\u201d game of\nmake-believe has to be played; a person who makes believe that Apollo\nis a rock-star is not playing the game correctly, or is perhaps\nplaying another game. But now consider\n (4).\n In order for an utterance of (4) to be fictionally true, hence for it\nto be really true on its non-conniving use, it must allude to a game\nin which there is a fictional character named \u201cMickey\nMouse\u201d who has the special property of being a pop culture\nicon\u2014a \u2018Meinongian\u2019 pretense, as Recanati\n(2000) calls it. Now, such a game is not constrained by any text;\nthere is no Mickey Mouse story that describes Mickey Mouse in these\nterms. The game in question is instead one where facts about the\nimportant place occupied in popular culture by the Mickey Mouse\nstories are what make it fictionally true in the game that Mickey\nMouse has the special property of being a pop culture icon.\nTo that extent the game is an unofficial one.\n\nOn this account, then, external metafictional sentences enjoy no\nspecial status; in particular, they don\u2019t provide us with a\nreason for assuming the existence of fictional entities. Our final\nexample returns us to Pirandello\u2019s Six Characters in Search\nof an Author. Consider an utterance of:\n\n(10) The\nFather is a fictional character.\n\n\nOn the one hand, this is an external metafictional sentence of the\nvery same kind as (5), a sentence that the speaker uses to describe\nthe metaphysical status of one of the protagonists of\nPirandello\u2019s work. On the other hand, (10) may also be taken as\na fictional sentence, since Pirandello\u2019s play is characterized\nby the fact that its protagonists are not ordinary concrete\nindividuals but fictional characters. In such a case, the sentence has\ntwo distinct non-conniving uses. On its use as a fictional sentence it\nis allegedly equivalent to:\n\n(10\u2032)\nAccording to Six Characters in Search of an Author, the\nFather is a fictional character.\n\n\nIn this case,\n (10)\n is really true in so far as it is fictionally true relative to a game\nauthorized by the work Six Characters in Search of an Author.\nIn the other case, it is really true in so far as it is fictionally\ntrue relative to an unofficial game in which some entities count as\n\u2018real people\u2019 and some as \u2018fictional\ncharacters\u2019, with the Father correctly singled out as one of the\nlatter because \u2018he\u2019 originated in a work of fiction.\n\nWalton\u2019s pretense-based version of antirealism has been very\ninfluential (for a development of the view, see Everett 2013), but it\nhas also attracted a great deal of criticism. Some have doubted that a\nsentence\u2019s fictional truth on its conniving use can ground a\nsense in which it is really true on its non-conniving use (cf.\nVoltolini 2006), a move that is crucial to his antirealism. Others\nhave doubted that Walton\u2019s appeal to unofficial games of\nmake-believe can yield appropriate antirealist paraphrases for\nmetafictional sentences in general, perhaps because these critics deny\nthat such sentences involve either explicit or implicit appeals to\npretense (Thomasson 1999, van Inwagen 2003).\n2.1.5 Quantificational arguments for realism\n\nOf course, to show that some antirealist paraphrases of\nfictional sentences do not work does not mean that no such\nparaphrases will work. Perhaps it is always possible to find new\nparaphrases that do not raise any of the problems hitherto pointed\nout, whether such paraphrases are based on a new version of the\npretense-theoretic approach or on some other approach. To take this\npoint into account, some realists have pursued a different\nlinguistically-based strategy. To be, as Quine said, is to be the\nvalue of a variable (Quine 1948). Hence if we can locate existentially\nquantified discourse involving quantification over fictional\nentities\u2014either directly, as external metafictional sentences\nthat can themselves be used as premises to derive other metafictional\nsentences, or indirectly, as a result of a valid inference from\nexternal metafictional sentences\u2014then it seems that such\nontological commitment is unavoidable. In this connection, consider\nthe sentence:\n\n(11) There is\na fictional character who, for every novel, either appears in that\nnovel or is a model for a character who does.\n\n\nNot only can such a sentence be inferred from, say:\n\n(12) Sancho\nPanza is a model for at least one character in every novel, apart from\nthe novel Don Quixote, in which he himself\nappears,\n\n\nbut it also legitimizes an inference to:\n\n(13) If no\ncharacter appears in every novel, then some character is modelled on\nanother character\n\n\n(cf. van Inwagen 2000: 243\u20134).\n\nNow, it is certainly true that insisting on the need to preserve the\nvalidity of the above inferences in any account of external\nmetafictional sentences is a good antidote to the antirealist\n\u2018paraphrase\u2019 strategy. For there is no guarantee that\nvalidity is preserved once the above sentences are paraphrased (say,\nin a pretense-theoretic manner \u00e0 la Walton). This\nsuggests that such antirealist paraphrases may not capture the meaning\nof the original sentences, leaving the field to realist construals of\nsuch sentences (cf. again van Inwagen (ibid.); for\nWalton\u2019s response, see Walton 1990: 416ff.).\n\nStill, this may not be enough to show that antirealism should be\nrejected. For while existential sentences like (11) that quantify over\nfictional characters are common enough, there are other existential\nclaims with the same logical features as (11) that philosophers are\nfar less likely to take as evidence of realism. Thus consider:\n\n(14) While\nthere is an imaginary emperor who Nathan Salmon imagined took over\nFrance, there certainly is no imaginary emperor who Nathan Salmon\nimagined took over Canada.\n\n\nThis sentence is suggested by Nathan Salmon\u2019s account of\nallegedly empty names in Salmon 1998. Salmon suggests that while\nfictional names in general stand for abstract created fictional\nentities, certain other terms are thoroughly non-referring or empty.\nIn this connection, he contemplates the possibility of there being an\narmed fanatic who has just taken over the government of France by\ndeclaring himself emperor, and then stipulates that the name\n\u201cNappy\u201d is to refer to whoever is the present emperor of\nFrance if there is such a person (as there would be if this\nimaginative scenario were actual), and to nothing if there\nisn\u2019t. Such a name, he thinks, is clearly empty. Note, however,\nthat in Salmon\u2019s imaginative scenario,\n\n(15) Nappy is\na French emperor\n\n\nis true, but that there is no similar scenario involving a present\nemperor of Canada. A sentence like\n (14)\n is a natural way of recording this fact. But now we face a problem.\nAs Caplan (2004) points out, taking\n (11)\n as an evidence for the genuine existence of what van Inwagen calls\ncreatures of fiction suggests that we should, by parity of\nreasoning, take (14) as evidence for the genuine existence of sui\ngeneris creatures of the imagination. Or, to put the point the\nother way round, if we don\u2019t think that linguistically-based\nreasons such as the availability of an (apparently) true quantified\nsentence like (14) commit us to bizarre entities like Nappy, we should\nnot think that such reasons commit us to fictional entities either.\nFor variants of the problem and complications, see Kroon (2011, 2013,\n2015).\n\nNote that we do not even need quantificational locutions to see the\nproblem. If one thinks that the truth of the external metafictional\nsentence (5) commits us to the existence of a fictional character,\nAnna Karenina, then it is hard to resist the thought that the truth of\nthe non-quantified sentence:\n\n(16) That\nlittle green man is just a trick of the light\n\n\nuttered by someone who wants to describe the mistake made by those\naround him who think that they see a little green man, similarly\ncommits us to the existence of a certain creature of the imagination,\none who has the property of being a trick of the light (cf.\nKroon 1996: 186). Many would resist such an easy road to realism about\ncreatures of the imagination.\n2.2 Ontological Arguments for and Against Realism\n\nThe problems that one thus encounters in trying to let\nsemantic-linguistic arguments ground a commitment to fictional objects\ngive one reason to think that there is no semantical shortcut\navailable to the realist. That is to say, if a realist wants to claim\nthat our prima facie commitment to fictional entities is\njustified, she has to provide a genuine ontological argument to that\neffect.\n\nIn her 1999 book, Thomasson tried to provide just such an argument.\nHer argument claims that we cannot reject fictional objects if we\nadmit fictional works: given that fictional objects and fictional\nworks belong to the same genus of entities (the genus of created,\nartifactual objects) it would be false parsimony to accept the one and\nreject the other.\n\nThis argument has several problems. For one thing, it postulates an\nidentity of kind between fictional works and fictional entities that\nis far from intuitively clear. As Thomasson herself seems to admit\n(1999: 65), fictional works are syntactical-semantic entities, unlike\nfictional entities. But there is a similar argument that does not rely\non a parallelism between fictional works and fictional characters, but\non the fact that the identity conditions of the fictional works refer\nto fictional characters. In brief: if we admit a certain kind of\nentity, we cannot but admit all the other kinds of entities that\nfigure in the identity conditions of such an entity; we admit\nfictional works; so we cannot but also admit fictional objects because\nthey figure in the identity conditions of fictional works (cf.\nVoltolini 2003, 2006).\n\nIf the antirealist wants to challenge the realist on directly\nontological grounds, she has to discredit such arguments, and, better\nstill, provide an argument for the conclusion that there\ncannot be any fictional entities. Curiously enough, Russell,\nwho is usually remembered for having originated the\n\u2018paraphrase\u2019 strategy for eliminating apparent reference\nto nonexistent entities (see 2.11 above), also used\nnon-linguistically-based ontological arguments against admitting such\nentities. In fact, there is good reason to believe that he took his\nmain argument against Meinong to be that Meinongian entities\nare apt to violate the law of noncontradiction (cf. Russell\n(1905a,b)). In his (2005) and (2013), Everett reprises and extends\nRussell\u2019s ontological criticisms so that they become a critique\nof fictional entities in particular. He provides a number of arguments\nthat are intended to show that, first, such entities may violate some\nbasic logical laws\u2014not only the law of noncontradiction, but\nalso the symmetry of identity\u2014and, second, they may be\nproblematically indeterminate with respect to both their existence and\nidentity. These arguments are based on odd but intelligible stories in\nwhich, for example, one individual is both identical to and distinct\nfrom another, or in which it is indeterminate whether a certain\nindividual exists. The link to fictional characters is provided\nthrough certain bridging principles (more refined versions of such\nprinciples are provided in his 2013):\n\n(P1) If the world of a story concerns a creature a, and if\na is not a real thing, then a is a fictional\ncharacter.\n\n(P2) If a story concerns a and b, and if a\nand b are not real things, then a and b are\nidentical in the world of the story if and only if the fictional\ncharacter of a is identical to the fictional character of\nb.\n\nEverett\u2019s critique is interesting and innovative, and (given the\nworries expressed about language-focused arguments) in some ways a\nmodel of how an antirealist should really pursue the battle against\nwhat she believes are ontological illusions. But, not surprisingly,\nthe debate has not ended there. Although at least one influential\n(erstwhile) realist has conceded the power of Everett\u2019s\nargument, proposing an antirealist notion of assumption-relative truth\n(Howell 2011, 2015) in place of the realist absolute notion he\nchampioned earlier (Howell 1979), some other realists think that\nEverett underestimates the conceptual resources available to them.\n\n\nTake, for example, the case that seems to have exercised creationists\nthe most \u2014 the argument for indeterminate identity \u2014 and\nconsider an example like the following made-up nursery rhyme (from\nSchnieder & von Solodkoff 2009: 139):\n\nBah-Tale:\n\nThere once was a man called Bahrooh\n\nThere once was a man called Bahraah\n\nBut nothing determined if Bahraah was Bahrooh\n\nOr if they were actually two.\n\nGiven that \u201cBahraah\u201d and \u201cBahrooh\u201d are\nfictional names, it follows from (P1) and (P2) that it is\nindeterminate whether the fictional character Bahrooh is identical to\nthe fictional character Bahraah, contrary to philosophical consensus\nthat indeterminate identity is incoherent (see especially Evans 1980\nand the ensuing literature).\n\nPhilosophers of fiction have not been slow to respond to this\nargument. Few have been willing to accept fiction-generated ontic\nindeterminacy (Thomasson 2011 and Paganini 2023 are among the\nexceptions). Schnieder & von Solodkoff (2009) suggest that (P2)\nitself is to blame, and that there is a better default principle of\nidentity that lets story-relative ontic indeterminacy suffice for\ndeterminate ontic distinctness. Such a variation on (P2) would block\nBah-Tale from implying ontic indeterminacy, although some, siding with\nEverett, think the variation is ad hoc (Caplan & Muller\n2014). Others challenge the role played by principles of identity. Lee\n(2022), for example, argues that the identity of fictional characters\nis (usually) to be settled by appeal to authorial intentions rather\nthan principles of identity, and that this is enough to disarm alleged\nexamples of ontic determinacy. But even if we stress the importance of\nprinciples of identity, what such principles show may not be all that\nclear. One popular line of argument holds that Everett-style cases\nonly generate semantic, not ontic, indeterminacy (Thomasson 2011,\nCameron 2013, Woodward 2017). Some even think that an appeal to more\nor less familiar neo-Meinongian distinctions between i) predicative\nand propositional negation and ii) modes of predication\n(alternatively, kinds of property) is enough to block the inference to\nontic indeterminacy (Voltolini 2010). Of course, antirealists take\nsuch distinctions to be poorly understood and part of what makes\nrealism an unattractive option in the first place (they may also be\nunusable in complex fiction-involving sentences; see again Everett\n2013; for a reply, cf. Voltolini 2015b)). Hence even if such rebuttals\nare successful on their own terms, this is not likely to settle the\nrealism-antirealism debate.",
