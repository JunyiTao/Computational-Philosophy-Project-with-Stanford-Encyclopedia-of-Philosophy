    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nBorn in Rome most probably in the fifth decade of the thirteenth\ncentury, Giles was the first outstanding theologian of the relatively\nrecently founded Order of the Augustinian Hermits. Nothing more is\nknown about his origins: the statement that he belonged to the famous\nRoman family of the Colonna seems to go back to Jordan of Saxony\u2019s\nLiber Vitasfratrum (second half of the 14th century), but is\ncompletely missing from contemporary, 13th-century sources. From Giles\u2019\nwill we know that he was sent to Paris to study in the convent of his\nOrder. At the beginning he must have followed the courses either of a\nsecular master or of a theologian belonging to a different Order, as\nthe Augustinian friars did not have a regent master at the time.\nProbably he was a pupil of Aquinas\u2019 in the years 1269\u20131272. He\ncommented on the Sentences at the beginning of the 1270s. In following\nyears he most probably wrote also a large number of his commentaries on\nAristotle.\n\n\nThe year 1277 marked a turning-point in his career: Giles was\ninvolved in the condemnation of the heterodox Aristotelianism issued by\nthe Parisian bishop Etienne Tempier, although the process against him\nmust be distinguished from the famous decree of the 7 of March 1277, as\nRobert Wielockx has shown. After 1277 Giles must have abandoned Paris,\nbut his presence is attested in Italy not earlier than 1281. Before\nleaving Paris he completed his De regimine principum, which is\ndedicated to the young Philip, the future Philip the Fair.\n\n\nBetween 1281 and 1284 Giles played an important role in the\ngovernment of his Order, taking part in various chapters held in Italy.\nAt the provincial chapter of Tuscania (nowadays in Lazio, Italy) in\n1285 he acted as vicar of the prior general of his Order, Clement of\nOsimo.\n\n\nIn 1285, Giles\u2019 doctrine was examined again; after recanting only a\npart of what had been previously condemned in 1277, he was allowed to\nteach again; by 1287 he is referred to as a master of theology. His\nuniversity quodlibeta go back to this period, from the academic year\n1285/86 to 1292/93 (Pini 2006, Wielockx 2014).  This success enhanced\nGiles of Rome\u2019s authority even more in his Order, whose general\nchapter of Florence decreed that Giles\u2019 works (even future ones)\nshould be considered as the official doctrine of the Order, to be\ndefended by all Augustinian bachelors and masters. In 1292, at the\nGeneral Chapter of Rome he was elected prior general of his Order.\n\n\nBenedict Caetani\u2019s election to the papal see marked a further\nradical change in his career, as Boniface VIII appointed him archbishop\nof Bourges in 1295. As a matter of fact, Giles was very often absent\nfrom his see, spending extended periods of time at the papal curia. In\nhis De renuntiatione, he defended the legitimacy of\nCelestine\u2019s abdication, and, consequently, of Boniface\u2019 s\nelection. When the contrast between Boniface VIII and Philip IV reached\nits most critical point, he continued to side staunchly with the pope.\nAn important sermon defending the papal position has been\ndiscovered by Concetta Luna, and Giles\u2019 De ecclesiastica\npotestate undoubtedly ranks among the sources of Unam\nSanctam.\n\n\nGiles\u2019 prestige decreased after Boniface\u2019 death, and even more\nwith the rise of Clement V to the papal throne. Before being elected\npope, Betrand de Got, as archbishop of Bourdeaux, had had serious\nconflicts with Giles. This unfavorable change, however, did not prevent\nGiles from playing a significant role in the debates of his time.\nAround 1305\u20136 he took part in a commission which examined and condemned\nthe eucharistic doctrine of John of Paris, a former adversary of Giles\u2019\nduring the conflict between Philip the Fair and Boniface. In the\ndiscussions concerning the Templars which eventually led to the\nsuppression of the Order, Giles sided with Philip the Fair, attacking\nthe Templars and devoting a whole tract, Contra exemptos, to\nthe thesis that their exemption from episcopal jurisdiction was the\ncause of their abuses (Jordan 2005). During the Council of Vienne Giles was asked to\ndraw a list of errors extracted from the works of Peter John Olivi:\nthree of them were officially condemned by the Council. On December 22,\n1316 he died at the papal Curia at Avignon (For further details see Del\nPunta-Donati-Luna 1993, Briggs 2016).\n\nRelying on manuscript evidence and other sources, Giorgio Pini (2005)\ncould identify which kind of theological and philosophical works Giles\nread, studied and had copied for himself during his long intellectual\ncareer. Pini distinguishes three main periods. In the first one,\nbefore 1277, quite unsurprisingly, he reads Aquinas (not only the\nCommentary on the Sentences of the Dominican master, but also his\nlater works), Aristotle (e. g. in these years Giles owns and annotates\na copy of the Nicomachean Ethics), Avicenna and Averroes. He\nis also very well acquainted with the works of Ps. Denis the\nAeropagite. In the second period (1277\u20131285), when forced to leave the\nacademic milieu, Giles widens his interests. He studies many works of\nAnselm\u2019s (while most theologians of his time were very selective in\ntheir knowledge of this author), and makes acquaintance with works by\nAugustine, such as Confessions and Soliloquia, that were\nquite unusual readings for an academic theologian. In the this period\n(from his return to the Parisian Faculty of Theology [1285] to his\ndeath) Giles studies almost entirely the available works by Augustine\nand acquires also rare treatises by Proclus. Giles\u2019 increasing\nattention for Augustine is mirrored in his mature works and will\ninfluence also the theological orientation of his own Order in the\nfollowing decades (Pini 2012).\n",
