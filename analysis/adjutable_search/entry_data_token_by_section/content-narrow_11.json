    "main_text": "Conceptions of Narrow Content || Conceptual Role\n4.2 Conceptual Role\n\nA second approach to narrow content identifies narrow contents with\n\u201cconceptual roles.\u201d This approach was laid out in a\nprogrammatic way by Ned Block in his essay \u201cAdvertisement for a\nSemantics for Psychology\u201d (Block 1986). The general idea is that\nthe conceptual role of a particular state is a matter of its causal\nrelations to other states. As Block puts it, conceptual role \u201cis\na matter of the causal role of the expression in reasoning and\ndeliberation and, in general, in the way the expression combines and\ninteracts with other expressions so as to mediate between sensory\ninputs and behavioral outputs\u201d (p. 93). However, conceptual role\nshould not be understood to include all the causal relations\nbetween a given state and other states: \u201cConceptual role\nabstracts away from all causal relations except the ones that mediate\ninferences, inductive or deductive, decision making, and the\nlike\u201d (p. 94).\n\nThe easiest way to get a feeling for conceptual role semantics is to\nconsider the kind of example that it seems to fit most naturally.\nSuppose that we have a mental representation we will symbolize as\n\u2018*\u2019. Suppose further that \u2018*\u2019 stands in the\nfollowing causal relations with other mental representations.\n\nIf the subject bears the belief relation to sentential mental\nrepresentations P and Q, then the subject is likely to also acquire\nthe belief relation to the compound representation P*Q.\nIf the subject bears the belief relation to P*Q, then the subject\nis likely to also acquire the belief relation to P.\nIf the subject bears the belief relation to P*Q, then the subject\nis likely to also acquire the belief relation to Q.\n\n\nIf the representation \u2018*\u2019 is related in these ways to\nother mental representations, it seems reasonable to say that it\nexpresses the relation of conjunction, i.e. that\n\u2018*\u2019 should be interpreted as \u2018and\u2019. In fact,\nwe might want to go so far as to say that satisfying the conditions\nabove constitutes meaning conjunction. It is worth noticing\nthat these three conditions closely resemble the rules that typically\ncharacterize conjunction in natural deduction systems of propositional\nlogic. Reflecting on this similarity may suggest some potential\nproblems for conceptual role semantics.\n\nThese potential problems include the following. (1) Rules of inference\nare normative rather than descriptive. They tell us what inferences\nare permissible; they do not purport to provide an empirical account\nof what inferences people actually make. It is not clear how a\ndescription of the causal interactions between mental states can\ncapture this normative element (Williams 1990; for a critique of the\nidea that mental content is normative, see Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss\n2009). (2) One might wonder whether there is something backward about\nthe view that conceptual role determines meaning. In the case of\npropositional logic, a standard view is that the meaning of logical\nconnectives such as conjunction is given by a truth table,\nwhich shows how the truth or falsity of a compound sentence is\ndetermined by the truth values of its component sentences. The\nadequacy of a system of inference rules is then determined by whether\nit permits derivations of all and only those arguments that are\nsemantically valid. Similarly, perhaps the causal roles of mental\nstates should be explained in part by their semantics, instead of the\nother way around. (3) Conceptual role semantics seems more plausible\nfor logical connectives than for other sorts of representations. It is\none thing to regard the meaning of a mental symbol for conjunction as\ndetermined by the inferences a subject will make between mental\nrepresentations that contain the symbol and those that do not. After\nall, that is what conjunction is for. It is another and much\nbolder thing to regard more empirical mental representations as having\ntheir meanings determined in this way.\n\nTwo additional problems, already identified in Block\u2019s essay,\nhave been much discussed since. First, conceptual role semantics seems\nto lead to a very extreme holism. If all or nearly all of the\ninferential relations between mental representations are included in\ntheir conceptual role, then it seems that a change in the meaning of\nany representation will also change the meanings of all or nearly all\nthe others, and also that nearly any change in belief will result in a\nchange in the meaning of one\u2019s representations. We ordinarily\nthink that there is an important difference between changes of belief\nand changes of meaning, but it is hard to see how to capture this\ndifference within conceptual role semantics. Second, conceptual role,\nas understood by Block and others, may seem too\n\u201csyntactic\u201d to constitute a conception of content at all.\nIn particular, conceptual role does not naturally give rise to an\naccount of truth conditions. As Block puts it, \u201cis narrow\ncontent really content?\u201d Block himself regards conceptual role\nas a determinant of content, and leaves it an open question\nwhether it is also a kind of content. But if conceptual role\nis not actually a kind of content, then it does not satisfy all of the\noriginal motivations for introducing a notion of narrow content.\n",
