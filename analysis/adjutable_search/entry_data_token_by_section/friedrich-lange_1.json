    "main_text": "Pedagogy\n2. Pedagogy\n\nOne of Lange\u2019s earliest intellectual interests was in\ntheoretical questions about the purpose and method of education.\nBefore he had even taken up his first job as a high school teacher in\nCologne, he was already thinking and writing about reforming the\nGerman Gymnasium system. Like others, he was concerned that the\nemphasis on the classics in the Gymnasia failed to prepare students\nfor a time in which the natural sciences were increasingly important\n(Lange 1865a, 401).\n\nLange returned throughout his career to questions of pedagogy and the\nhistory of pedagogy. Knoll concludes that, despite his many\npublications and lectures on pedagogy, despite his collaboration with\nK. A. Schmid on the Encyklop\u00e4die des gesammten Erziehungs-\nund Unterrichtswesens, Lange appears not to have made a\nsignificant impact, either on his contemporaries or in the history of\npedagogy (Knoll 1975a, 8). He attempted to give lectures on pedagogy\nwhen he started teaching at the University of Bonn, but failed to\ngenerate any interest among the students for his lectures (Knoll\n1975b, 112\u201313). Knoll\u2019s claims are dubious, however. As\nBeiser (2014a) points out, almost all professors in Jena at the time\nhad trouble attracting students to their lectures because \u201cthere\nwere not enough students\u201d, and it is hard to imagine that Bonn\nwas much different (p. 41). Moreover, Jacobsen (1999), K\u00f6hnke\n(1991), and others observe that Max Weber counted Lange\u2019s\nlectures among his favorites (Jacobsen 1999, 7 and passim), and that\nthe pedagogist Friedrich Paulsen, and the philosophers and pedagogists\nPaul Natorp and Hans Vaihinger, among others, were influenced\nsignificantly by Lange\u2019s work (K\u00f6hnke 1991, 211\u2013213\nand passim). Ultimately, Lange was to have a profound influence on Max\nWeber (Jacobsen 1999). Finally, Lange\u2019s colleague in Bonn,\nFriedrich \u00dcberweg, wrote in his well-known and widely used\ntextbook Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie notes\nLange\u2019s influence on the pedagogist and educator Theobald\nZiegler (1846\u20131918) (p. 249).\n\nLange claimed that the purpose of education should be to produce\nrational, cultured citizens. Lange tried to show that turning to both\nthe history of education and the history of pedagogy would throw light\non the question of how to produce such citizens. The history of\neducation would help us understand the way in which social, cultural\nand political conditions interact to bring about specific kinds of\neducation in particular historical contexts (Lange 1855).\n\nCreating free citizens and leaders requires that the teachers\nthemselves be actively engaged in their communities as citizens.\nTeachers should not be prevented from political engagement, as only\npolitically engaged teachers will be able to communicate to their\nstudents the love of freedom and fatherland. As he was later to\nemphasize in his History of Materialism, simply instructing\npeople, including students, to be ethical\u2014to be concerned with\nthe good of humanity in general\u2014does not have much of an impact.\nIn the case of education one can have an impact by presenting a role\nmodel and by being a personal inspiration for one\u2019s students.\nHis example is that of Thomas Arnold of Rugby, whom he believed was\nable to shape his students\u2019 ethical views precisely because he\nwas so impressive as a person. This personality was the result of, and\nconstituted by, his active engagement with the political issues of his\ntime (Lange 1862).\n\nChristian virtues were for Lange an essential part of education;\nhowever, the relevant form of Christianity seems to be quite vague,\nindeed bordering at times on some form of \u201cindeterminate\npantheism\u201d (Knoll 1975a, 13). This is no surprise given his\nlater discussions of religion (see below). Education, in the inclusive\nsense of Bildung, also required instruction in philosophy.\nExposure to philosophy is an essential part of learning how to make\nreasoned decisions. There must also be education in politics. This\ngives one the requisite knowledge to participate in political affairs\nand helps prepare one for being a citizen (Knoll 1975b, 123).\n\nThe importance of education, and the crucial role of the freedom of\nthought in education, implied, for Lange, that any social entity\nshould have the right to set up schools and decide what should be\ntaught in them. The state should set up schools only where existing\nstructures of civil society have failed to generate enough schools.\nThe state should restrict the opening of a school only when it poses a\ngenuine threat to a legitimate state or explicitly promotes criminal\nactivity. There should be no requirement that there be any religious\ninstruction, let alone a requirement that any particular religion be\ntaught. In state schools, there should be no religious instruction\n(Lange 1968b, 125\u2013127).\n\nLange tries to take a middle position on the relative importance of\nnatural talent and social environment for both the method and results\nof education. He grants that there probably are given differences in\ndispositions, but maintains that the environment has a significant\ninfluence on how these dispositions express themselves and on how\nstudents\u2019 talents develop. He criticizes social Darwinist\ntheories that think there is no need to pay attention to the barriers\nto development created by the lack of economic or social privileges\n(Lange 1873\u201375, 255; Lange 1894a, 48\u201349). On the other\nhand, he warns against an idealism that assumes fundamental human\nequality of ability (Knoll 1975a, 19\u201320).\n\nFinally, Lange went against contemporary trends to argue that pedagogy\nshould be informed by the emerging science of empirical psychology;\nthough he granted that empirical psychology was a very young\ndiscipline that had so far failed to produce many compelling results\n(Lange 1859\u20131875, \u201cSeelenlehre\u201d, 142; Knoll 1975a,\n16). He emphasized the importance of statistical methods\u2014an\nemphasis that was also quite prescient for the later development of\npedagogy (Knoll 1975a, 19).\n",
