    "main_text": "Five Problems || The problem of uniform semantics\n2.3 The problem of uniform semantics\nOne of the most significant features of platonism is the fact that\nit allows us to adopt the same semantics for both mathematical and\nscientific discourse. Given the existence of mathematical objects,\nmathematical statements are true in the same way as scientific\nstatements are true. The only difference emerges from their respective\ntruth makers: mathematical statements are true in virtue of abstract\n(mathematical) objects and relations among them, whereas scientific\nstatements are ultimately true in virtue of concrete objects and the\ncorresponding relations among such objects. This point is idealized in\nthat it assumes that, somehow, we can manage to distill the empirical\ncontent of scientific statements independently of the contribution\nmade by the mathematics that is often used to express such\nstatements. Platonists who defend the indispensability argument insist\nthat this is not possible to do (Quine 1960; Colyvan 2001a); even some\nnominalists concur (Azzouni 2011).\nMoreover, as is typical in the application of mathematics, there\nare also mixed statements, which involve both terms referring\nto concrete objects and terms referring to abstract ones. The\nplatonist has no trouble providing a unified semantics for such\nstatements either\u2014particularly if mathematical platonism is\nassociated with realism about science. In this case, the platonist can\nprovide a referential semantics throughout. Of course, the platonist\nabout mathematics need not be a realist about\nscience\u2014although it's common to combine platonism and realism in\nthis way. In principle, the platonist could adopt some form of\nanti-realism about science, such as constructive empiricism (van\nFraassen 1980; Bueno 2009). As long as the form of anti-realism\nregarding science allows for a referential semantics (and many do),\nthe platonist would have no trouble providing a unified semantics for\nboth mathematics and science (Benacerraf 1973).\nIt is not clear that the nominalist can deliver these benefits. As\nwill become clear shortly, most versions of nominalism require a\nsubstantial rewriting of mathematical language. As a result, a\ndistinct semantics needs to be offered for that language in comparison\nwith the semantics that is provided for scientific discourse.\n\n",
