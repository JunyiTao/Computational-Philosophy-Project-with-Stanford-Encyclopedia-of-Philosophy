Altruism and the Levels of Selection\n\n\nThe problem of altruism is intimately connected with questions about\nthe level at which natural selection acts. If selection acts\nexclusively at the individual level, favouring some individual\norganisms over others, then it seems that altruism cannot evolve, for\nbehaving altruistically is disadvantageous for the individual organism\nitself, by definition. However, it is possible that altruism may be\nadvantageous at the group level. A group containing lots of\naltruists, each ready to subordinate their own selfish interests for\nthe greater good of the group, may well have a survival advantage over\na group composed mainly or exclusively of selfish organisms. A process\nof between-group selection may thus allow the altruistic behaviour to\nevolve. Within each group, altruists will be at a selective\ndisadvantage relative to their selfish colleagues, but the fitness of\nthe group as a whole will be enhanced by the presence of altruists.\nGroups composed only or mainly of selfish organisms go extinct,\nleaving behind groups containing altruists. In the example of the\nVervet monkeys, a group containing a high proportion of alarm-calling\nmonkeys will have a survival advantage over a group containing a lower\nproportion. So conceivably, the alarm-calling behaviour may evolve by\nbetween-group selection, even though within each group, selection\nfavours monkeys that do not give alarm calls.\n\n\nThe idea that group selection might explain the evolution of\naltruism was first broached by Darwin himself. In The Descent of\nMan (1871), Darwin discussed the origin of altruistic and\nself-sacrificial behaviour among humans. Such behaviour is obviously\ndisadvantageous at the individual level, as Darwin realized: \u201che\nwho was ready to sacrifice his life, as many a savage has been, rather\nthan betray his comrades, would often leave no offspring to inherit his\nnoble nature\u201d (p.163). Darwin then argued that self-sacrificial\nbehaviour, though disadvantageous for the individual\n\u2018savage\u2019, might be beneficial at the group level: \u201ca\ntribe including many members who...were always ready to give aid to\neach other and sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be\nvictorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural\nselection\u201d (p.166). Darwin's suggestion is that the altruistic\nbehaviour in question may have evolved by a process of between-group\nselection.\n\n\nThe concept of group selection has a chequered and controversial\nhistory in evolutionary biology. The founders of modern \nneo-Darwinism\u2014R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. \nHaldane and S. Wright\u2014were all aware that\ngroup selection could in principle permit altruistic behaviours to\nevolve, but they doubted the importance of this evolutionary\nmechanism.  Nonetheless, many mid-twentieth century ecologists and\nsome ethologists, notably Konrad Lorenz, routinely assumed that\nnatural selection would produce outcomes beneficial for the whole\ngroup or species, often without even realizing that individual-level\nselection guarantees no such thing. This uncritical \u2018good of the\nspecies\u2019 tradition came to an abrupt halt in the 1960s, due\nlargely to the work of G.C. Williams (1966) and J. Maynard Smith\n(1964). These authors argued that group selection was an inherently\nweak evolutionary force, hence unlikely to promote interesting\naltruistic behaviours. This conclusion was supported by a number of\nmathematical models, which apparently showed that group selection\nwould only have significant effects for a limited range of parameter\nvalues.  As a result, the notion of group selection fell into\nwidespread disrepute in orthodox evolutionary circles; see Sober and\nWilson 1998, Segestrale 2000, Okasha 2006, Leigh 2010 and Sober 2011 for details of the\nhistory of this debate.\n\n\nThe major weakness of group selection as an explanation of altruism,\naccording to the consensus that emerged in the 1960s, was a problem\nthat Dawkins (1976) called \u2018subversion from within\u2019; see\nalso Maynard Smith 1964. Even if altruism is advantageous at the\ngroup level, within any group altruists are liable to be exploited by\nselfish \u2018free-riders\u2019 who refrain from behaving\naltruistically. These free-riders will have an obvious fitness\nadvantage: they benefit from the altruism of others, but do not incur\nany of the costs. So even if a group is composed exclusively of\naltruists, all behaving nicely towards each other, it only takes a\nsingle selfish mutant to bring an end to this happy idyll. By virtue of\nits relative fitness advantage within the group, the selfish mutant\nwill out-reproduce the altruists, hence selfishness will eventually\nswamp altruism. Since the generation time of individual organisms is\nlikely to be much shorter than that of groups, the probability that a\nselfish mutant will arise and spread is very high, according to this\nline of argument. \u2018Subversion from within\u2019 is generally\nregarded as a major stumbling block for group-selectionist theories\nof the evolution of altruism.\n\n\nIf group selection is not the correct explanation for how the\naltruistic behaviours found in nature evolved, then what is? In the\n1960s and 1970s a rival theory emerged: kin selection or\n\u2018inclusive fitness\u2019 theory, due originally to Hamilton\n(1964). This theory, discussed in detail below, apparently showed how\naltruistic behaviour could evolve\nwithout the need for group-level selection, and quickly\ngained prominence among biologists interested in the evolution of\nsocial behaviour; the empirical success of kin selection theory\ncontributed to the demise of the group selection concept. However, the\nprecise relation between kin and group selection is a source of\nongoing controversy (see for example the recent exchange\nin Nature between Nowak, Tarnita and Wilson 2010 and Abbot\net. al. 2011). Since the 1990s, proponents of \u2018multi-level\nselection theory\u2019 have resuscitated a form of group-level\nselection\u2014sometimes called \u2018new\u2019 group selection\u2014and\nshown that it can permit altruism to evolve (cf. Sober and Wilson\n1998). But \u2018new\u2019 group selection turns out to be\nmathematically equivalent to kin selection in most if not all cases,\nas a number of authors have emphasized (Grafen 1984, Frank 1998, West\net al. 2007, Lehmann et al. 2007, Marshall 2011); this point was\nalready appreciated by Hamilton (1975). Since the relation between\n\u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 group selection is itself a\npoint of controversy, this explains why disagreement about the\nrelation between kin and group selection should persist.\n",
