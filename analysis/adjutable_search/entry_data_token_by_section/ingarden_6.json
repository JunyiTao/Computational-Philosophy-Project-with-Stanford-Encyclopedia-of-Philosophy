    "main_text": "Aesthetics || The Musical Work, The Picture, The Architectural Work\n3.3 Aesthetic Objects, Aesthetic Values, and Aesthetic Experience\n\n\nIn addition to his work on the ontology of art objects of various\nkinds, Ingarden also undertook general work on the ontological status\nof the aesthetic object and the nature of aesthetic values, as well as phenomenological work on the experience of works of art of various kinds. On the\nobject side, as we have seen he distinguishes in each case between the\nmere physical object and the work of art; but he also distinguishes\nboth of these from what he calls the \u201cconcretization\u201d\n(sometimes translated as \u201cconcretion\u201d) of the work of art,\nwhich he considers to be the true \u2018aesthetic object\u2019. The\nwork of art itself, in the case of most forms of art such as\nliterature, painting, or music, is what Ingarden calls a\n\u201cschematic formation.\u201d That is, it has certain\n\u2018places of indeterminacy\u2019, many of which are filled in by\nan individual interpretation or \u2018reading\u2019 of the work. Thus\nin the case of literature, there are many places of indeterminacy at\nthe level of character and plot \u2014 unlike in the case of real people,\nit is often simply indeterminate what a literary character had for\nbreakfast, how far she sat back from the table, what the table was made\nof, etc. Such indeterminacies are generally partially filled in by the\nreader in reconstructing the work, as the reader\u2019s background\nassumptions help (at least partially) flesh out the skeletal imaginary\nscene directly presented by the words of the text. Similarly, a\nrepresentational painting generally leaves indeterminate, e.g., what\nthe back of the person\u2019s head looks like in the case of a portrait,\nwhat they are thinking, or what happens immediately before or after the\nmoment visually represented in paintings of historical events. Yet\nagain, viewers\u2019 reconstructive acts typically supplement these\nindeterminacies in various ways, e.g. automatically grasping the lower\nright corner of Breugel\u2019s \u2018Fall of Icarus\u2019 as presenting\nthe moment between a fall from the sky and the complete disappearance\nof the body under water (not, e.g., as presenting an attempt at an\nunderwater handstand). Finally, in the case of music, a score leaves\nindeterminate various elements such as the precise timbre and fullness\nof tone, and these are filled out in different ways in different\nperformances of the work. In each case, (at least partially) filling in\nthe indeterminacies of the work through a reading, performance, or\nviewing renders the work more \u2018concrete\u2019. Each work of art\npermits of a variety of legitimate concretizations which, unlike the\nwork of art itself, may vary from viewer to viewer. If the concretion\noccurs within the aesthetic attitude, an aesthetic object is formed\n[Selected Papers, 93], and so many aesthetic objects may be\nbased on one and the same work of art.\n\n\nCorresponding to this three-fold distinction between physical\nobject, work of art, and aesthetic object, Ingarden posits a three-fold\ndistinction among properties. While the mere physical object possesses\nonly value-neutral physical properties, the work of art may possess\nboth \u2018axiologically neutral\u2019 properties such as having a\ncertain sentence structure or bearing patches of color arranged in\ncertain ways, and artistic value qualities founded on these, such as\nclarity or obscurity of expression, technical mastery in the way the\nmaterials are worked, balance of composition, etc. Aesthetic values\nsuch as serenity, sublimity, profundity, etc., though they exist\n\u2018potentially\u2019 in the work of art, only manifest themselves\nin the aesthetic objects created through concretizing the work of art,\nand characterize the aesthetic object as a whole, although their\nappearance may depend on that of many particular properties of the work\nof art and physical object. Since various aesthetic objects may be\nbased on one and the same work of art, these may also differ in their\naesthetic values. This can, at least in part, help account for the\nvariety of aesthetic judgments that may be formed apparently concerning\nthe same work of art.\n\n\nYet as usual, Ingarden is concerned to account for the role of\nconsciousness in constituting aesthetic values and the variations in\naesthetic judgments without embracing a subjectivism that would deny\nthat there is any better or worse in aesthetic judgment, each being a\nmere report of the pleasure experienced by the one judging. Such\nsubjectivism is to be avoided by noting first, that some\nconcretizations are better suited to the work\u2019s demands than others,\nmore faithful, or better able to bring out the potential values in the\nwork. A careful interpreter and evaluator can, through repeated contact\nwith the work, come increasingly close to separating out idiosyncratic\nelements of her interpretations from what is proper to the work.\nSecondly, the aesthetic properties of the resulting concretization are\nnot arbitrary inventions of the viewer, nor are they based on the\npleasure she derives from the experience. Instead, their appearance\nsimply requires a competent viewer to observe the work\u2019s neutral and\nartistic values in an aesthetic attitude. Thus here, as elsewhere,\nIngarden\u2019s goal is ultimately to account for the legitimate role of\nconsciousness in constituting many of the objects and properties\nexperienced by us, while also avoiding a pure subjectivism or universal\nsocial constructivism by acknowledging the role of an independent\n\u2018real\u2019 world in founding the cultural objects and value\nproperties we so often concern ourselves with in daily life.\n\nIn addition to his work on the ontology of works of art and their values, Ingarden also engaged in directly phenomenological investigations into the nature of our experience of works of art of various kinds. For example, he examines our experience of literature in The Cognition of the Literary Work of Art, of music in The Work of Music and the Problem of its Identity, and of aesthetic experience more generally (including experience of sculpture) in \u201cAesthetic Experience and Aesthetic Object\u201d. In each case he is concerned not only to offer a detailed analysis of the development of the relevant aesthetic experience (including its development over time), but also to contrast such aesthetic experiences with cases of ordinary sense perception, undertaken in what he calls a \u2019practical\u2019 or an \u2018investigating attitude\u2019 (1961, 295). \n\n\nThanks to Ira Richardson for research assistance with the 2020 updated version of this entry.\n\n",
