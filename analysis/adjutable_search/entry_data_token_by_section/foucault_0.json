    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nFoucault was born in Poitiers, France, on October 15, 1926. As a\nstudent he was brilliant but psychologically tormented. He became\nacademically established during the 1960s, holding a series of\npositions at French universities, before his election in 1969 to the\nprestigious Coll\u00e8ge de France, where he was Professor of the\nHistory of Systems of Thought until his death. From the 1970s on,\nFoucault was very active politically. He was a founder of the\nGroupe d\u2019information sur les prisons and often\nprotested on behalf of marginalized groups. He frequently lectured\noutside France, particularly in the United States, and in 1983 had\nagreed to teach annually at the University of California at Berkeley.\nAn early victim of AIDS, Foucault died in Paris on June 25, 1984. In\naddition to works published during his lifetime, his lectures at the\nColl\u00e8ge de France, published posthumously, contain important\nelucidations and extensions of his ideas.\n\nOne might question whether Foucault is in fact a philosopher. His\nacademic formation was in psychology and its history as well as in\nphilosophy, his books were mostly histories of medical and social\nsciences, and his passions were literary and political. Nonetheless,\nalmost all of Foucault\u2019s works can be fruitfully read as\nphilosophical in either or both of two ways: as carrying out\nphilosophy\u2019s traditional critical project in a new (historical)\nmanner; and as a critical engagement with the thought of traditional\nphilosophers. This article will present him as a philosopher in these\ntwo dimensions.\n",
