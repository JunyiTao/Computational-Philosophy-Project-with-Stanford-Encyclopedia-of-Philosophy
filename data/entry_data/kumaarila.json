    "preamble": "\n\n\nKum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, who likely flourished around 660\nce, was a proponent of the orthodox\nBrahmanical school of P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. Among\nthe most influential thinkers in the history of Indian philosophy, he\nmade significant contributions regarding the full range of issues that\nfollow from that school\u2019s constitutive concern with Vedic authority\nand exegesis; virtually all Indian philosophers writing subsequent to\nhim\u2014and particularly Buddhist philosophers, whose positions were\nmost completely antithetical to his\u2014found it necessary to reckon\nespecially with his work in epistemology and philosophy of\nlanguage. Among the areas in which he exercised lasting influence are\nhermeneutics, poetics, jurisprudence, and (arguably) historiography.\nChief among the doctrines that have occasioned philosophical\ninterest in him is that of svata\u1e25\npr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya\u2014\u201cintrinsic\nreliability,\u201d which might be understood as immediate justification\u2014which\nsurely represents Kum\u0101rilas most significant epistemological\ncontribution; occasionally dismissed as fundamentalist in spirit, this\nhas come to be appreciated (sometimes in light of the \u201creformed\nepistemology\u201d advanced by contemporary thinkers such as William\nAlston and Nicholas Wolterstorff) as a cogent working-out of the kinds\nof commonsensical epistemic intuitions characteristic of Thomas\nReid. Together with a robust realism about linguistic universals and\nthe peculiarly M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka conviction that the Vedic\ntexts are eternal, this epistemology was effectively deployed by\nKum\u0101rila to show that a commitment to the uniquely authoritative\nstatus of the Vedas (and to the ritual practices enjoined thereby) was\nrationally held.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life, works, and influence\n1.1 Indian philosophical debate in the middle of the first millennium\n\n\nHaving flourished in the latter part of the seventh\ncentury ce, Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\nwas roughly contemporaneous with the Buddhist philosopher\nDharmak\u012brti, whose own predecessor Dign\u0101ga was among the philosophical rivals whom Kum\u0101rila critically engaged; Kum\u0101rila has long been recognized as a significant influence on his younger contemporary \u015aa\u1e45kara\n(fl. c. 710). Kum\u0101rila thus wrote at a time of profoundly significant\nphilosophical activity in India, contributing much to a pan-Sanskritic\ndiscourse\u2014sometimes referred to as\npram\u0101\u1e47a-\u015b\u0101stra, or the \u201cdiscipline of epistemic warrants\u201d\u2014that was\ncharacterized by shared standards of rationality and inter-traditional\ndebate. Pressed from all sides by opponents from rival schools of thought, Indian philosophers at this time were keen to maintain the consistency of their various commitments in the face of critique; with all these disputants sharing a Sanskritic philosophical vocabulary that had been refined particularly by Buddhists, India\u2019s philosophical traditions quickly developed in subtlety and sophistication from this point on.\n\n\nCharacteristic of this period of inter-traditional debate is the\nlegendary account of Kum\u0101rila as having studied for a time at the\nfamous Buddhist monastic university at N\u0101land\u0101, then in its\nprime. Based on the mastery of Buddhist doctrine he thus gained,\nKum\u0101rila went on to decisively counter Buddhist\nphilosophical positions. According to a Buddhist variation on such\nlegendary reflections of the state of philosophical contestation (one\nrecorded by the 17th-century Tibetan historian T\u0101ran\u0101tha),\nKum\u0101rila is indeed represented as having defeated various lesser\nBuddhist thinkers in debate. However, his renown prompted the Buddhist\nDharmak\u012brti, in turn, to go in disguise to study with\nKum\u0101rila,\nfrom whom Dharmak\u012brti learns\nthe key to Kum\u0101rila\u2019s thought and then bests him in debate,\nconverting Kum\u0101rila and his followers to Buddhism. As history,\nsuch accounts are surely as suspect as the view (still attested\nin some Indian scholarship) that Kum\u0101rila\u2019s dialectical\nsuccesses are chiefly to be credited for the decline of Indian\nBuddhism. Nevertheless, these traditions confirm at least that\nKum\u0101rila was a formidable philosophical opponent of his Buddhist\ncounterparts. It is fitting, then, that among the sources for studying\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s thought should be not only the texts of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka commentators on his work\u2014particularly U\u1e43veka\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da (fl. c. 710), P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra (fl.\nc. 1075), and Sucaritami\u015bra (c.1120)\u2014but also the work of the scholar Buddhist\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (c.725\u2013788), whose massive\nTattvasa\u1e43graha extensively engages (and quotes from the\nworks of) Kum\u0101rila.\n1.2 The Brahmanical tradition of P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\n\n\nIt is sometimes surmised from his evident knowledge of Dravidian\nlanguages (his Tantrav\u0101rttika includes some discussion of\nTamil word forms) that Kum\u0101rila may have been south Indian; as\nis typically the case for the figures of classical Indian philosophy, though,\nhe is really known to us only in the stylized terms of traditional\nhagiographies. What is certain is that Kum\u0101rila was one of the two\nmost significant commentators on the foundational texts of the\ntradition of P\u016brva M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101; indeed, this\northodox Brahmanical tradition of thought divides chiefly along two\nlines of seventh- and eighth-century commentary, with those\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas who take their bearings from Kum\u0101rila\nhaving been styled Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6das (\u201cfollowers of\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u201d), while those who defer instead to\nPrabh\u0101kara\u2014who flourished around 700, and who is sometimes\nsaid to have been Kum\u0101rila\u2019s student\u2014are\ncomparably called \u201cPr\u0101bh\u0101karas.\u201d\n\n\nInsofar as this central divergence between Kum\u0101rila and\nPrabh\u0101kara involves reference to a shared foundation of texts, it\nis important to appreciate the traditional Brahmanical context for\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s thought. \u201cM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u201d literally means something like \u201cinvestigation\u201d or \u201cinquiry,\u201d but here refers particularly to hermeneutical inquiry. Kum\u0101rila\u2019s tradition of\nP\u016brva (\u201cprior\u201d) M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101,\nthen, is typically so denominated in contrast to\n\u201cUttara,\u201d or \u201csubsequent,\u201d\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. \n\nBoth strands of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 have as their guiding concern the\ninterpretation and right application of Vedic texts, which these two\nschools agree in thinking to be uniquely authoritative for matters of\nultimate concern. These schools differ chiefly over which portion of\nthis vast corpus of texts should be thought definitive; for\n\u201cVeda\u201d\u2014a scriptural category that is arguably\ndefinitive of \u201cHinduism\u201d\u2014represents a status\ntraditionally claimed for a huge range of texts, composed over a large\nperiod of time (from c. 1200 bce to early in the first millennium\nand even later), and comprising a wide spectrum of literary genres and\ncharacteristic doctrines. Advocacy of the \u201cP\u016brva\u201d\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 position is defined by commitment to the\nauthority particularly of the earlier portion of the Vedic corpus\n(culminating with texts called Br\u0101hma\u1e47as), which\nchiefly concerns the performance of ritual sacrifice; hence, the school\nof thought advanced by Kum\u0101rila was also well known as Karma\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (\u201chermeneutics of ritual action\u201d) or Adhvara\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (\u201chermeneutics of sacrifice\u201d). In contrast, Uttara\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 takes its bearings from that portion\nof the Vedic corpus that comprises the Upani\u1e63ads, which were\ntraditionally styled \u201cVed\u0101nta\u201d (\u201cculmination of\nthe Veda\u201d); indeed, the same word is more familiar to many modern readers as denoting Uttara M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 itself. \n\n(On relations between these two\ntraditions of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, see the essays in Bronkhorst 2007.)\n\n\nJust as texts in the many strata of the Vedic corpus mostly represent\nthemselves as in some sense interpreting the texts that precede them,\nso, too, the philosophical tradition of P\u016brva\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (henceforth, simply\n\u201cM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u201d), in this regard typifying the generally scholastic character of first-millennium Indian philosophy, developed in the form of commentaries on the foundational texts of the tradition (and\ncommentaries on the commentaries, etc.). M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, as\nadherents of this school are called, thus take their bearings from the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 S\u016btras attributed to a\ncertain Jaimini, who is thought to have flourished near the beginning\nof the first millennium ce. The first of Jaimini\u2019s\ns\u016btras (\u201caphorisms\u201d) names \u201cthe desire\nto know dharma\u201d\n(dharmajij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101) as the constitutive concern\nof M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, where dharma is represented\nin early commentary simply as what \u201cconnects a person with the\nhighest good.\u201d Among the salient points about the goal thus\ncommended by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s foundational text is\nthat dharma, as here imagined, denotes a constitutively future\nstate of affairs; dharma, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas typically\nsay, is always \u201cyet to be\u201d (bhavi\u1e63yat).\n\n\nThis characterization of dharma can be taken to suggest that\nit has something to do with post-mortem existence states of affairs, which\nwere indeed among the expected results of certain Vedic rites.\n(Early proponents of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 differed from most other\nIndian philosophical schools in not taking liberation from\nsa\u1e43s\u0101ra to be the ultimate desideratum.) The\nperennially subjunctive character of talk of dharma perhaps\nmore significantly reflects, however, the view that Vedic injunctions\nessentially enjoin the ongoing bringing into being\n(bh\u0101van\u0101) of a ritual world that must continually be\nrenewed; it is insofar as no one ever finishes bringing this\nworld into being that its realization is always still to come. (See, on\nthis idea, Clooney 1990, 129\u2013161.) Philosophically, the significant\npoint is that, as always yet to be realized, the summum\nbonum for M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas is essentially inaccessible\nto perception, and only language can be thought to represent a way of\nknowing it. This is surely the paramount intuition informing the entire\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka project, which centers on confidence in the\nepistemic status of Vedic injunctions and the mind-independent reality\nof language.\n1.3 The works of Kum\u0101rila as commentaries on foundational texts\n\n\nTypifying the \u201cs\u016btra\u201d genre of mnemonic concision,\nJaimini\u2019s aphorisms are often intelligible only with reference to\ncommentaries; the earliest of the completely extant commentaries on\nJaimini\u2019s s\u016btras is that of \u015aabara (fl. c. 400 c.e.),\nwhose commentary (which itself quotes from at least one\nno-longer-extant earlier commentary) defines the basic parameters of\nthe tradition\u2019s unfolding. The divergent elaborations of the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka project represented by Kum\u0101rila and\nPrabh\u0101kara are therefore framed, in turn, as commenting on\n\u015aabara\u2019s interpretation of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nS\u016btras. It is typical, then, for passages from\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s corpus to be cited with reference to the section\nof \u015aabara\u2019s commentary from which they depart\u2014which\neffectively means that Kum\u0101rila\u2019s topics can usually be\nreferred to by the particular s\u016btras of Jaimini upon which\n\u015aabara was himself commenting. So, for example,\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s elaboration of the svata\u1e25\npr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya (\u201cimmediate justification\u201d)\ndoctrine in epistemology is framed in terms of \u015aabara\u2019s\ncommentary on Jaimini\u2019s \u201ccodan\u0101\ns\u016btra\u201d\u2014the s\u016btra, that is, that specifies\nthat Vedic \u201cinjunction\u201d (codan\u0101) is the only\nvalid way of knowing dharma. References, then, to the passages\nin which Kum\u0101rila develops his signal epistemological contribution\nare typically to the numbered verses of the \u201ccodan\u0101\ns\u016btra\u201d chapter of his\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika.\n\n\nThe latter title names one of four works attributed to Kum\u0101rila,\nand one of the two most important; it is the\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika that is typically taken to be of\ngreatest philosophical significance, and it was surely this work that\nwas most recurrently engaged by other Indian philosophers. The\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika is framed by \u015aabara\u2019s\ncommentary on the beginning of the first chapter of Jaimini\u2019s\nwork\u2014the part of \u015aabara\u2019s commentary traditionally\nstyled \u201cTarkap\u0101da,\u201d or the \u201cpart\nconcerning reasoning,\u201d wherein \u015aabara considers as a\npreliminary matter questions pertaining to whether Vedic texts\nought in the first place to be thought an epistemically reliable basis\nfor action. It is thus in the \u015alokav\u0101rttika\nthat Kum\u0101rila argues for the epistemological and metaphysical\ncommitments relevant to the governing claim that the Vedas are uniquely\nauthoritative for matters of ultimate concern. Typically of the\n\u201cv\u0101rttika\u201d genre of commentary,\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s \u201ccommentary\u201d often significantly\nrevises or elaborates on the thoughts advanced in \u015aabara\u2019s\ntext, and the novelty of some of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s arguments is\ntherefore often clear. Typically, as well, of the inter-traditionally\ncontested period in which he wrote, the epistemological and other\narguments of the \u015alokav\u0101rttika generally involve\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s heavily engaging rival Indian schools of thought\nand showing their alternative positions to fail as defeaters. While the\narguments are in the service of claims (such as that the Vedas are\neternal) that are unlikely to be attractive to modern readers, this\ntext is often a model of philosophical subtlety and sophistication.\n\n\nThe philosophically rich \u015alokav\u0101rttika can be\nunderstood, however, as a prolegomenon to the real, hermeneutical\nbusiness of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, which is most significantly\nadvanced in Kum\u0101rila\u2019s Tantrav\u0101rttika. Framed\nas a commentary on the remainder of \u015aabara\u2019s chapter 1\nthrough his chapter 3, this massive work addresses questions raised by\nthe different kinds of sentences to be found in the Vedas, the status\nof Brahmanical literature that is not part of the Vedic corpus, and all\nmanner of grammatical and metaphysical issues pertaining to the\nperformance of Vedic ritual as that is enjoined by sometimes\ninterpretively obscure Vedic texts. In this under-studied text, then,\nthere is much to be learned about Kum\u0101rila\u2019s highly ramified\nphilosophy of language, as well as about the ideological and practical\nparticulars of the ritualistic Vedic worldview. In addition to the\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika and the Tantrav\u0101rttika,\nKum\u0101rila authored the Tup\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, which\ncomments on the remaining balance of \u015aabara\u2019s commentary;\nand the no-longer-extant B\u1e5bhat\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101,\nwhose extensive treatment of many of the concerns of the\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika is recoverable from the large parts of\nit that are preserved in the Buddhist\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Tattvasa\u1e43graha (see\nFrauwallner 1962).\n2. Epistemology: Direct realism and the doctrine of immediate justification\n2.1 Early M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas on the epistemic status of Vedic testimony\n\n\nIt is relevant to begin with Kum\u0101rila\u2019s characteristic\nepistemological doctrine not only because this is widely thought to be among his most characteristic philosophical contributions, but also\nbecause Kum\u0101rila appeals to the epistemological intuitions\nelaborated in this doctrine in arguing, as well, for a great many of\nhis other claims; indeed, the commonsense realism reflected in\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology represents a useful way into his overall\nphilosophical project, which is shot through with essentially realist\ncommitments. Thus, for example, Kum\u0101rila was strongly critical of\nthe doctrine of svasa\u1e43vitti\n(\u201cself-awareness\u201d), which is arguably foundational for the\nBuddhists Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti; it is particularly\ninsofar as that doctrine figures in a generally representationalist\nepistemology\u2014one that is to be understood as part of a larger\nBuddhist case for epistemic and perhaps even metaphysical\nidealism\u2014that Kum\u0101rila will have no truck with the idea,\ninstead affirming that what we are immediately aware of is just the\nordinary objects we typically take ourselves to be aware of.\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s guiding intuition, then, is that we are generally\njustified in taking awareness as veridically disclosing precisely the\nkind of world it seems to us to disclose.\n\n\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s development of a comprehensive epistemological\norientation along these lines is occasioned by \u015aabara\u2019s\ncommentary on the second of Jaimini\u2019s\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 S\u016btras. So, having announced\nin the first s\u016btra that the \u201cdesire to know\ndharma\u201d is the constitutive concern of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, Jaimini then says in the second\ns\u016btra that \u201cdharma is a goal defined by [Vedic]\ninjunction (codan\u0101)\u201d\u2014that, in other words,\nwhat is epistemically authoritative with respect to what\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas take to be the summum bonum is just\nthe texts of the Vedas (and more precisely, those injunctive passage\nthat enjoin the execution of particular ritual acts). This amounts to\nthe generally epistemological claim that among the various ways of\nknowing available to us, the linguistic items that are Vedic texts\nuniquely represent \u201creliable epistemic warrants\u201d\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) with regard to dharma.\n\n\nIndian philosophers, particularly under the influence of the Ny\u0101ya\ntradition of thought (and of the appropriation and systematization of\nits main terms of art by the Buddhists Dign\u0101ga and\nDharmak\u012brti), were generally preoccupied by Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ntime with the issue of pram\u0101\u1e47as\u2014with the\nquestion of which doxastic practices (perception, inference, testimony,\netc.) should be reckoned as \u201cepistemic criteria\u201d or\n\u201creliable doxastic practices\u201d (as we might render\npram\u0101\u1e47a), and with characterizing the criteria so\nidentified. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s Buddhist opponents\ncharacteristically affirmed, in this regard, that only perception and\ninference had this status, and that all other ways of arriving at\nbeliefs were somehow reducible to one of these. Proponents of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 chiefly affirmed, in contrast, not\nonly that there is an irreducibly and distinctively linguistic\nway of knowing, but indeed that it is this (and not perception) that\nshould be understood as most significant. For while it is in\nthe nature of perception to bear only on actually present states of\naffairs\u2014the salient point of Jaimini\u2019s fourth s\u016btra,\non perception, is that this consists in the kind of sensory cognition\nhad when there is contact with something present\n(satsa\u1e43prayoge)\u2014language alone has the capacity\nto engender awareness of future, or \u201cto-be-realized\u201d\n(bh\u0101vya), states of affairs. Insofar, then, as the\ndharma that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas are most interested in\nis just such a state of affairs, the fact of perception\u2019s bearing\nonly on what is (as it were) ready-to-hand is to be reckoned a\ndeficiency. The epistemological project for proponents of this school\nthus becomes that of making sense of the unique epistemic authority of\nthe kinds of Vedic injunctions (paradigmatically, \u201cone desirous\nof heaven should perform the agnihotra sacrifice\u201d) that\nwould not fare well on any account that instead privileged\nperception.\n\n\nTo that end, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s predecessor \u015aabara argued that\nlinguistic utterances engender some cognition\n(avabodhayati), and that as long as the idea thus engendered\nis clear or \u201cdeterminate\u201d (ni\u015bcita), one is\nentitled to accept it as a basis for action. Of a sentence such as\n\u201cone desirous of heaven should perform a sacrifice,\u201d then,\n\u015aabara would mainly ask:\u00a0 do you understand the\nsentence? If not, then the sentence is reasonably disregarded\nowing to its engendering an essentially doubtful\n(sa\u1e43digdham) cognition; but insofar as the sentence\nmakes an epistemically contentful claim, we are entitled to judge the\nprima facie unambiguous cognition thus brought about to be\nfalse only if it is explicitly falsified\u2014only if we have, that is, knowledge to the effect that someone has not gone\nto heaven as a result of having performed the agnihotra\nsacrifice. Determinately contentful linguistic cognitions that have not\nbeen falsified are reasonably taken, then, as bases for action.\n2.2 Kum\u0101rila\u2019s development of a general epistemological doctrine\n\n\nDespite, however, \u015aabara\u2019s probably warranted confidence\nthat his interlocutors could never be in a position to show\nthat sentences regarding the post-mortem careers of Vedic practitioners\nare falsified, the burden of proof will surely be thought by most to\nremain on him. It is at this point, though, that Kum\u0101rila more\nconvincingly shifted, in effect, the burden of proof. His\nground-breaking approach to epistemology involves raising a\nsecond-order question about the doxastic practices we take to be\nreliable (about, that is, pram\u0101\u1e47as). Of any way of\nknowing, then, that might be thought relevant to the adjudication of a\nclaim such as \u015aabara\u2019s (and Kum\u0101rila recognized that it\nis strategically advantageous in this regard to focus especially on\nperception), Kum\u0101rila asks:\u00a0 does it have its status\nas epistemically reliable\u2014does it have, as\nKum\u0101rila puts it, its pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya, or\n\u201cbeing\na pram\u0101\u1e47a\u201d\u2014\u201cintrinsically\u201d\n(svata\u1e25), or does it have this property only on account of something else (parata\u1e25)? What\nKum\u0101rila thus asks is whether any cognition\u2019s having the\nepistemic qualities in virtue of which it is to be reckoned a reliable\nwarrant\u2014truth-conduciveness, say, or the capacity to confer\njustification\u2014is something that obtains immediately, or\nwhether instead justification is necessarily mediated by one\u2019s having\nhigher-order reasons for confidence in one\u2019s first-order\ncognitions.\n\n\nThe locus classicus for Kum\u0101rila\u2019s argument here\nis verse 47 of the codan\u0101 s\u016btra chapter of the\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika:\u00a0 \u201cIt should be understood\nthat all pram\u0101\u1e47as\u2019 have the property of\nbeing pram\u0101\u1e47as intrinsically; for a capacity not\nalready existing by itself (svata\u1e25) cannot be produced\nby anything else.\u201d (All of the passages given here from\nKum\u0101rila and his commentators can be found in Arnold 2005,\n57\u2013114.)  The argument Kum\u0101rila concisely expresses here in\nverse form is straightforward but compelling: if it is thought that\nany cognition finally counts as a reliable warrant only insofar as it\ncan be demonstrated to be such (for example, by appeal to a subsequent\ncognition of the causes of the initial one), infinite regress ensues;\nfor the subsequent, justifying cognition would, as itself a cognition,\nsimilarly require justification, and so on. Or, as Kum\u0101rila here\nsuggests, if the initial cognition isn\u2019t credited with the\nintrinsic \u201ccapacity\u201d for conferring justification, then no\nfurther cognition could be able to bestow that, either\u2014unless,\nof course, the further cognition is itself credited with immediately\nhaving that capacity, in which case, why not simply allow this with\nrespect to the initial cognition? As Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ncommentators like to put it, if it is thought that we must await\nsecond-order justification before thinking we are justified in\ncrediting first-order cognitions, then \u201cthe whole world would be\nblind.\u201d\n\n\nAmong Kum\u0101rila\u2019s guiding intuitions here is the commonsensical\nthought that radical skepticism is not a tenable idea\u2014that, in\nother words, it is to be presumed that we\nare, simply as a matter of empirical fact, already justified\nin believing a great deal, and that the task of epistemology is\ntherefore to consider what must be the case in order for that to make sense.\nThe thrust of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s argument can be brought out by\nbriefly contrasting this epistemological position with what\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas not unreasonably took to be the\ncharacteristically Buddhist position in this regard (with its being\nparticularly the thought of Buddhists like Dign\u0101ga and\nDharmak\u012brti that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas targeted with their epistemological arguments). Against the kind of\ncommon-sense realism exemplified by proponents of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, these Buddhists were inclined to\nencourage wariness with regard to our ordinary epistemic intuitions;\nBuddhists, after all, are chiefly concerned to argue that we are\nmistaken in inferring (what is perhaps among our most unshakable\nconvictions) that our manifestly episodic cognitions are the states of\nan underlying self. To that end, Buddhists like Dign\u0101ga\nand Dharmak\u012brti privileged what they took to be the constitutively\nnonconceptual, perceptual awareness that ultimately discloses,\nthey take it, only fleeting particulars. Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nintuition in this regard was that it is especially in virtue of the\ncausally describable character of perception that it is thus to be\nprivileged, since on his view, the capacity to interact causally with\nother particulars is what distinguishes anything as really\nexistent. (This intuition means, among other things, that\nBuddhists would also attack the strong linguistic realism of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, since the kinds of abstract objects posited\nto make sense of language cannot be thought to have causal\nefficacy.)\n\n\nIn characterizing what he takes to be the Buddhist position with regard\nto the issues we are here scouting following Kum\u0101rila, the later\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka commentator P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra\ninvokes these central commitments of Dharmak\u012brti to motivate a\ncase for the direction of explanation that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas\nwould reverse:\u00a0 \u201cSince we see that there is cognition of\na jar that is sometimes based on a jar, and sometimes not\nbased on a jar, a jar cannot be ascertained only by that [i.e., only by\na cognition that seems to us to have a jar as its content].\nAccordingly, it must be ascertained that the arising of a cognition of\na jar really is based on a jar only after ascertainment that there is a\njar which really exists as the cause of that cognition, [which\nascertainment can be] based only on perception of pragmatic\nefficacy.\u201d This credibly represents Buddhists in the tradition of\nDign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti as holding that we reach epistemic\nbedrock only when we have \u201ccognition whose phenomenal content is\npragmatic efficacy\u201d (arthakriy\u0101nirbh\u0101sa\u1e43\nj\u00f1\u0101nam)\u2014that, in other words, it is reasonable\nto doubt whether things really are as represented in cognition until we\nhave arrived at the kind of awareness that is causally related to what\nit is of (as, for example, when one not only sees that there is a jar,\nbut actually carries water with it).\n\n\nThat is what it might look like to suppose, against\nthe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, that the status of first-order\ncognitions as epistemically reliable should be thought to\nrequire demonstration with reference to something over and above the\ninitial cognitions. Against this, Kum\u0101rila argues that the problem with\nsuch an appeal is that the second-order awareness that the\nthing perceived is pragmatically efficacious is itself just another\ncognition. Kum\u0101rila would allow, then, that a subsequent\ncognition concerning pragmatic efficacy could count as a potential\nsource of falsification; the impossibility of carrying water with what\nhad seemed to be a jar would indeed count as overriding the previously\njustified belief that one had seen a jar. What he refuses, however, is the\nclaim that the cognition of pragmatic efficacy provides a fundamentally\ndifferent kind of justification than the initial cognition.\nConfidence, to the contrary, that pragmatic efficacy does\nprovide something more\u2014that it tells us, e.g., that an\ninitially justified belief is also true\u2014could\nonly be based on the presupposition that \u201cpragmatic\nefficacy\u201d is somehow more immediately available to awareness\nthan, say, a jar; but this begs precisely the question at issue, and\nKum\u0101rila can not unreasonably ask why the Buddhist is willing to\ncredit the second-order cognition as intrinsically valid, but not the\nfirst.\n2.3 The significance of falsification for Kum\u0101rila\u2019s doctrine\n\n\nIt is important to appreciate the extent to which Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nepistemology involves essentially phenomenological\nconsiderations about the credibility of cognition. He says in this\nregard (at codan\u0101 verse 53) that \u201cthe epistemic\nreliability of cognition is obtained just by virtue of its consisting\nof cognition\u201d\u2014that, in other words, it is simply in the\nnature of contentful awareness to make an epistemic claim on the\nsubject thereof, and that these claims are to be suspended or set aside\nonly when specifically countervailing cognitions are forthcoming.\nMoreover, one typically does not go seeking knowledge that\none\u2019s first-order cognitions are false; rather, it is only when\npresented with overriding cognitions\u2014cognitions,\nKum\u0101rila says, typically brought about \u201ceffortlessly,\u201d i.e.,\nwithout any ostensibly justificatory search on the part of the\nsubject\u2014that one sometimes finds it necessary to revise one\u2019s\njudgments. Kum\u0101rila does not propose, then, that one must first\nconsider and rule out all possible defeaters before arriving at\nconviction; the point, rather, is that one\u2019s judgment is justified\nuntil and unless some specifically overriding cognition happens to be\nforthcoming.\n\n\nAn account of the possible overriding of prima facie justified beliefs\nturns out, then, to be integral to Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology.\nOne might, in this regard, worry that on the view he thus proposes,\nsecond-order cognitions of defeaters end up themselves having a\nprivileged status; that is, Kum\u0101rila might be thought to credit\n\u201coverriding cognitions\u201d\n(b\u0101dhakaj\u00f1\u0101na) with a capacity for effecting\nepistemic closure such as he does not allow for the initial cognitions\nthus overridden (which, as with scientific hypotheses for Popper, are\ntaken as never able to provide any definitive epistemic\nclosure). Thus, for example, it could be supposed that one might just\nas well conclude, from the fact that two contradictory cognitions have\narisen, that the second one is suspect\u2014and that it\nwould therefore be unwarrantedly privileging \u201coverriding\u201d\ncognitions to suppose that second-order cognitions ipso facto\ncount as evidence of the falsity of the prior cognitions on which they\nbear.  Here, though, it matters that Kum\u0101rila\u2019s account\ninvolves essentially phenomenological considerations; his point is\njust that a subsequent cognition calls for the revision of a preceding\none only if it seems to a subject to do so. Thus, to\nhave some prima facie justified belief subsequently called into\nquestion just is for the subsequent cognition to present\nitself as having, phenomenologically, the force of overriding the\npreceding; if that is not how the second awareness seems, then its\nphenomenological content will not be that of an overriding\ncognition in the first place, and it therefore will not present itself\nto the subject thereof as undermining any already-held belief.\n\n\nIt might also be worried that Kum\u0101rila\u2019s account of\nfalsification leaves the epistemic process infinitely open, with\nsomething like an infinite regress of potential revisions\u2014that\nwe could never be entitled, on this account, to claim anything like\nknowledge. Regarding this line of objection,\n Kum\u0101rila\n and his\ncommentators finally fall back on an appeal to common sense, urging\nthat it is unreasonable to encourage doubt where no specific cognition\nof any deficiencies explicitly raises one; otherwise, as the\ncommentator Sucaritami\u015bra puts it, \u201cthere would be the\nunwanted consequence of annihilating all worldly discourse.\u201d The\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas thus take it that skeptical concerns can\nreasonably be pressed only so far, and that if it is thought that we\nare entitled only to those beliefs that have been decisively secured\nagainst all such doubts, then it would turn out that we know very\nlittle indeed. This thought reflects, again, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ncommonsense realism, according to which it is beyond doubt that we\ndo know a great deal, and that any epistemology according to\nwhich that turns out to be problematic is, ipso facto, to be\nthought suspect.\n2.4 Alternative interpretations of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology\n\n\nThe foregoing reading, on which Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ncharacteristic epistemological doctrine centrally involves the claim\nthat phenomenologically determinate cognitions immediately confer\nprima facie justification, is informed by one of a couple of\nsignificant lines of traditional interpretation of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ntexts; in particular, this reflects the interpretation of the\ncommentator P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra, which is arguably\npreferable both in terms of its exegetical adequacy to Kum\u0101rila,\nand in terms of its philosophical cogency. (See, however, McCrea 2018 for a different perspective on the matter.) There is, however, an\nalternative line of interpretation to be gleaned from the commentary\nof Kum\u0101rila\u2019s near-contemporary U\u1e43veka Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\n(whose commentary is referred to in the Buddhist\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s engagements with Kum\u0101rila).  Among\nthe salient points of U\u1e43veka\u2019s reading is the worry that\nKum\u0101rila cannot, as has so far been suggested, have meant to\nargue that all phenomenologically credible cognitions are to\nbe credited with being truth-conducive; seemingly counter, then, to\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s own suggestion (quoted above) that \u201cthe validity\nof cognition is obtained just by virtue of its consisting of\ncognition,\u201d U\u1e43veka notes that the fact of \u201cbeing a\ncognition\u201d (bodhakatva) commonly characterizes both\nveridical and erroneous cognitions.\n\n\nU\u1e43veka worries, then, that if Kum\u0101rila is understood as\nsaying that a cognition\u2019s being truth-conducive follows simply\nfrom its being a cognition, there would be the unwanted\nconsequence that if one mistook the glint of mother-of-pearl for that\nof a piece of silver (a stock example of error in Indian philosophy),\nthis erroneous cognition would have to be credited as a\n\u201cveridical cognition\u201d (pram\u0101\u1e47a). (It\nmatters for this discussion that the word pram\u0101\u1e47a\nis equivocal, alternately referring to reliable doxastic practices, and\nto episodes of veridical cognition such as result from the\nexercise thereof.) U\u1e43veka\u2019s intuition, then, is that\n\u201cbeing a pram\u0101\u1e47a\u201d can only\ncharacterize, as it were, the certified outcome of the\nepistemic process; he is therefore concerned to interpret\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s doctrine in such a way that \u201cbeing\nintrinsically truth-conducive\u201d ends up being predicated only of\nwhat are clearly veridical cognitions.\n\n\nTo that end, U\u1e43veka urges that Kum\u0101rila be understood as\narguing that what produces the truth-conduciveness intrinsic to some\ncognitions just is the causes of those cognitions that are\nveridical\u2014that, in other words, the point of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ncharacteristic claim is that the truth-conduciveness of any\ncognition originates intrinsically, arising from the same\ncausal factors in virtue of which it is rightly said to be\nveridical. With respect, then, to Kum\u0101rila\u2019s claim\n(at codan\u0101 47) that \u201ca capacity not already\nexisting by itself cannot be produced by anything else,\u201d\nU\u1e43veka glosses Kum\u0101rila\u2019s \u201cby anything else\u201d as\nsuggesting that a cognition\u2019s capacity for truth-conduciveness cannot\nbe produced by anything over and above the causal factors\nrelevant to cognition. From the perspective of an interpretation informed by P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra, it thus seems that U\u1e43veka retains precisely the idea\nKum\u0101rila means to call into question, which is that veridical\ncognitions can be distinguished particularly with reference to the\ncauses thereof; for on U\u1e43veka\u2019s view, what distinguishes a\nveridical cognition of silver from mistaking mother-of-pearl for\nsuch is the fact that in the former case alone, silver really is\npresent as the\ncause of the cognition. U\u1e43veka thus takes it that what\nimmediately or \u201cintrinsically\u201d attaches to cognitions is to\nbe understood not in terms of what may be the case prima facie\n(not in terms of how cognitions may at first appear), but in\nterms of what we end up with. The status of truth-conducive cognitions\nas truth-conducive, then, is understood as by U\u1e43veka as \u201cintrinsic\u201d only in the sense that this status results from the same causes that give rise to the cognitions so characterized\u2014which means we can determine which cognitions those are by identifying the relevant causes.\n\n\nIn contrast to this interpretation of Kum\u0101rila, the\neleventh-century commentator\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra\u2014who also wrote an independent\nessay on the doctrine here in view\n(entitled Svata\u1e25pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47yanir\u1e47aya,\n\u201cAscertainment of Intrinsic Validity\u201d; see A. Subrahmanya\nShastri 1982, Arnold 2002)\u2014embraced just the view that\nU\u1e43veka thought so problematic. P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra emphasizes that it was\nprecisely Kum\u0101rila\u2019s point to argue that all\nphenomenologically credible cognitions\u2014all cognitions, that is,\nthat first present themselves as candidates for the status of reliable\nepistemic warrants\u2014should be thought intrinsically or\nimmediately to have that status. This is, on one view of the matter, because\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra takes the fact of any cognition\u2019s\n\u201cbeing truth-conducive\u201d\n(pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya) essentially to concern not\ntruth, but justification\u2014not, that is, the\noutcome of the epistemic process, but what gets it off the\nground in the first place. Kum\u0101rila\u2019s reference, then, to\nthe \u201ccapacity\u201d that cognitions immediately have in this\nregard is to be understood as a capacity for conferring\njustification\u2014a thought that\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra expresses by saying he takes\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s doctrine to affirm (against U\u1e43veka) not\nthat this status intrinsically exists (bhavati), but\nthat it intrinsically \u201cappears\u201d (bh\u0101ti). The\npoint of departure on this understanding of Kum\u0101rila, then, is the\nkind of epistemic claim that any cognition seems to a subject\nto make upon him.\n\n\nAmong the points P\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra adduces in favor of\nthis interpretation is that U\u1e43veka cannot make sense of the\naccount of falsification that figures in Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nelaboration of his epistemology. On the reading of\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology proposed by U\u1e43veka,\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathi says, Kum\u0101rila would have to be understood\nas claiming, with regard to cognitions that turn out to be overridden,\nthat their truth-status had changed. In other words, on the\nview that \u201cbeing truth-conducive\u201d\n(pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya) is intrinsically produced\n(i.e., by the same causes that produce the cognition), any subsequent\nrevision in judgment would have to consist in the actual transformation\nof the initially known state of affairs\u2014what had been\ntrue, that is, would now be false. Against this,\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathimi\u015bra urges that \u201cthis doesn\u2019t\nmake sense, because of [the cognition\u2019s having been]\nnon-veridical from the outset.\u201d This rejoinder virtually amounts\nto the statement of a realist conception of truth:\u00a0 in cases where\nour initial cognition is overridden, the initial cognition was false\nall along; all that changes is our awareness thereof.\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathi thus separates the (subjective, epistemic)\nstate of justification from the (objective) fact of\ntruth, and clarifies that what is intrinsic to cognition has\nto do with the former. This is why P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi can\ncoherently take the whole doctrine of intrinsic validity precisely to\ndepend on what U\u1e43veka took to be an unwanted\nconsequence:\u00a0 its being all determinately contentful\ncognitions that can reasonably be assumed immediately to confer\njustification.\n\n\nOn this reading, then, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s doctrine is to be\nunderstood as holding that it is characteristic of contentful\ncognitions immediately to confer justification, with the\nmediation of higher-order cognitions capable not of conferring anything\nessentially different in kind, but only of calling for revision. If,\nabsent the arising of any overriding cognition, the prima facie\njustification holds, then the initial cognition stands as veridical\nin virtue of the fact that it was truth-conducive\u2014in\nvirtue of the fact, as P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi puts this point, that\n\u201cbeing truth-conducive\u201d (pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya)\nis the \u201cmotivator of the concept and the word\n\u2018pram\u0101\u1e47a\u2019\u201d\n(pram\u0101\u1e47abuddhi\u015babdayor bh\u0101vakatay\u0101).\nThis effectively reverses the direction of explanation favored by\nU\u1e43veka, who is instead concerned to argue that the status of\nbeing truth-conducive is caused by the same factors that cause\nveridical cognitions.\n\n\nIf it seems like settling for less thus to argue, with\nP\u0101rthas\u0101rathi, that defeasible justification is all that can\nbe yielded by our epistemic practices, he can rejoin by asking whether it could make sense to want anything more\nthan that; what could it look like, epistemically, not only to be\njustified in holding a belief, but also to know it is\ntrue? In fact, this is already just what one is entitled to\nthink in virtue of being justified, and it is hard to imagine what\nsense it could make to think we might be, with respect to any\nparticular belief, in a better epistemic position than already\nentitled to think it true. Indeed, it is arguably just the\npoint of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology thus to challenge the\nintuition that \u201cknowing\u201d could only consist in knowing\nthat one knows. Just, then, as with the influential efforts\nof contemporary \u201creformed epistemologists\u201d to undermine\nthe threat of \u201cevidentialist\u201d challenges (see, especially,\nAlston 1991, as well as Arnold 2005), Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology\namounts to a critique of empiricist foundationalism\u2014one that\ngets its purchase largely by showing that the foundationalist impulse\nends up leading to intractable skeptical problems such as can only be\nforeclosed by an appeal to common sense.\n3. Metaphysics and philosophy of language\n3.1 On the eternality of the Vedas, and of language in general\n\n\nOf course, there are, in addition to the foregoing philosophical\nconsiderations in favor of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology,\nspecifically M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka concerns driving the project. In\nthis regard, P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi has a particularly cogent point in\nfavor of the interpretation on which Kum\u0101rila has, as suggested\nabove, effectively reversed the standard order of epistemological\nexplanation. Thus, P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi urges that\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas cannot proceed on the assumption\nthat Kum\u0101rila meant to ask about the status only of\npram\u0101\u1e47as (i.e., only of those cognitions that are\nalready known to be veridical); for that would effectively disqualify\nthe Vedas from coming under the purview of this discussion, since\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s opponents will not grant that the\nVedas count as epistemically reliable (as a\npram\u0101\u1e47a) in the first place. Indeed, whether or not\nwe are entitled to think the Vedas epistemically reliable is just\nthe issue in question; it would therefore be to little avail to\nask how it is simply that cognitions already known to be reliable have\nthe status they do, since it must first be established that Vedic\ninjunction is a rational basis for action in the first place. And the\nonly way to further this goal, P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi argues, is to\nshow that all contentful cognitions (even those that turn out\nnot to have been veridical) should be recognized as immediately\nconferring justification. Aptly expressing the reversed direction of\nepistemological explanation commended by this interpretation, William\nAlston has asked to similar effect: if a subject\n\u201cwere not often really perceiving X why should the experience\ninvolved provide justification for beliefs about X?\u201d (1991: 10)\nSimilarly, P\u0101rthas\u0101rathi can ask: if it were not really the\ncase that one desirous of heaven should perform a Vedic sacrifice, then\nwhy (as this epistemological program is concerned to show) would the\nexperience of a Vedic injunction to that effect provide justification\nfor that belief?\n\n\nOn the view, then, that Kum\u0101rila\u2019s doctrine reverses the\nusual order of epistemological explanation, the claim is that insofar\nas any cognition engendered by a Vedic injunction intrinsically confers\njustification simply in virtue of its being a cognition, Vedic\ninjunction first becomes a candidate for the status of \u201creliable\ndoxastic practice\u201d (pram\u0101\u1e47a)\u2014and the\npoint of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology is that this is a status\nthat any reliable doxastic practice should then be thought to enjoy\nuntil or unless it is overridden. Here, though, is where other\ncharacteristically M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka commitments significantly\ncome into play\u2014chiefly, the commitment to the view that the\nVedic texts are, like language itself, eternal or primordial.\nJaimini\u2019s fifth M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 S\u016btra\nspecifies in this regard that \u201cthe relations between words and\ntheir referents are primordial (autpattika)\u201d\u2014a\nview meant to underwrite the claim that the Vedas themselves are\ntranscendent or \u201cimpersonal\u201d (apauru\u1e63eya).\nIt is, then, particularly together with this view that\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology can be taken to warrant the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka claim that the Vedas are, in fact,\nuniquely authoritative; for insofar as they are thus taken\nessentially to transcend any human perspective, Vedic injunctions,\nuniquely among reliable doxastic practices, therefore cannot\nbe falsified.\n\n\nThat the claims expressed by or implicit in Vedic texts cannot be\nfalsified has to do with the distinctive capacity of language to bear\non imperceptible states of affairs such as are not ready to hand, but\nalways \u201cgoing to be realized\u201d (bh\u0101vya or\nbhavi\u1e63yat). Thus, to the extent that any linguistic\nepisode reflects or expresses something of the epistemic perspective of\na particular language-user, the claim it makes is always such as can be\noverridden based on considerations involving that limited epistemic\nperspective\u2014based, e.g., on the speaker\u2019s mendacity, or\non his reporting a perceptual or inferential claim that turns out\nitself to be mistaken. Language itself, however, is not thus\nlimited by any particular perspective; to the extent, then, that one\njoins M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas (as Heidegger sometimes seems to do!)\nin finding intelligible the idea that language itself might,\nas it were, utter the Vedas, the fact of there being no epistemically\nlimited author whose intentions the Vedas would express means there\ncan, in this case alone, be no basis for overriding the claims that\nissue from these texts. (That M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas argued\nstrenuously against Buddhist and Jaina claims about the possible\ncultivation of omniscience reflects the stake they thus had in denying\nthat there could be any epistemically unlimited perspective;\nlanguage as such, in contrast to such individual knowers as\nthe Buddha and the Jina, is not itself a limiting perspective.)\n\n\nIt is important to note (what is sometimes overlooked) that the\nforegoing claims about the eternality of language and of the Vedas are\nlogically independent of the epistemological position Kum\u0101rila has\nelaborated; the epistemological doctrine of \u201cimmediate\njustification\u201d does not, that is, by itself support the claim\nthat the Vedas are uniquely authoritative. While Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nepistemology may, then, by itself show that Vedic texts are\njustifiably credited as epistemically reliable (that, in other\nwords, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka beliefs are rationally held),\nit is logically independent claims about the eternality of the Vedas\nthat are taken by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas to warrant the stronger\nconclusion that Vedic injunctions are uniquely so. It is\nimportant to appreciate the independence of these positions from one\nanother, and accordingly to note that the assessment of\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology (both traditionally and among modern\nscholars) is sometimes driven more by resistance to the eternality\nclaim than to anything integral to Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nepistemology.\n\n\nThus, for example, the tenth-century Ny\u0101ya thinker Jayanta\nBha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2014who was himself much influenced by the\nthought of Kum\u0101rila, and who was inclined to cede to\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas authority in hermeneutical\nmatters\u2014was worried, as a theist, about Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nepistemological case for the authoritative status of the\nVedas. Jayanta thought Kum\u0101rila\u2019s defense of the Vedas\nproblematic, however, chiefly insofar as Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology\ndovetails with claims about the eternality of the Vedas, thus making\nfor an essentially atheistic case for the eternality of the\nVedas.  So, while Ny\u0101ya thinkers like Jayanta characteristically\nheld that authorship of the Vedas is to be attributed to\n\u012b\u015bvara, \u201cGod,\u201d Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ndefense of the eternality of language involves critiques of\ntheism that are, indeed, very much like some characteristically\nBuddhist critiques of theism. (On this, see Krasser 1999.) But while\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemological doctrine is clearly meant to\ndovetail with these other commitments to secure a unique epistemic\nstatus for the Vedas, the claimed eternality of language (and the\nconsequent critique of theism) is not itself a point that is advanced\nby Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemological case for the immediately\njustificatory status of contentful cognitions; indeed, that there is\nnothing intrinsically anti-theistic about his epistemology is suggested\nby the fact that William Alston (1991) has elaborated a strikingly\nsimilar epistemology precisely in order to show specifically\ntheistic practices to be justified. To the extent, then, that\nJayanta attacks Kum\u0101rila\u2019s epistemology chiefly by pressing\nthe point that it is problematic to suppose there could be authorless\ntexts (as, for example, in his philosophical play\n\u0100gama\u1e0dambara; see Dezso 2005, 213\u201317), it should\nbe recognized that he misses the mark.\n\n\nDespite the importance of thus distinguishing these two moments in\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s case for Vedic authority\u2014the\nepistemological moment, that is, and the case for the\nessentially transcendent character of the Vedas\u2014it should be\nallowed that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka commitments regarding the\neternality of language in general (and of the Vedas in particular) are\nhardly incidental to their overall position. While, however, few modern\nreaders are likely to be favorably inclined towards the view that the\nVedic texts are authorless, these commitments reflect often profound\nintuitions, elaborated by Kum\u0101rila and other\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, about the irreducibly linguistic character\nof thought, and about the reality of the kinds of universals that must\nbe posited to make sense of the objectivity of language. Arguing, in\nthis regard, for the eternality of language, Kum\u0101rila challenged\n(chiefly Buddhist and Ny\u0101ya) proponents of contract- or\nconvention-theories of linguistic origins to explain how any\nparticular linguistic act could coherently be imagined as\nthe first such act. The problem he raises is that any\nparticular linguistic act is intelligible as a linguistic\nact\u2014intelligible, that is, as instituting linguistic\npolicies\u2014only given the prior understanding that the\nmeaning-creating utterance itself means something. One person\ncould, that is, propose to another that (for example) this thing here\nbe called a \u2018cow\u2019 only by telling her\nso\u2014but the possibility of his doing so is just what we are in\nthis case trying to explain.\n\n\nKum\u0101rila can be said in this regard to share Wittgenstein\u2019s\nfamously expressed intuition about the problem with Augustine\u2019s\naccount of language-acquisition. With regard to Augustine\u2019s contention that language-learning is explicable in terms of foundational moments of deictic usage, Wittgenstein says that \u201cAugustine describes the\nlearning of human language as if the child came into a strange country\nand did not understand the language of the country; that is, as if it\nalready had a language, only not this one. Or again: as if the child\ncould already think, only not yet speak. And\n\u2018think\u2019 would here mean something like \u2018talk to\nitself\u2019.\u201d (Wittgenstein 1958, \u00a732) Kum\u0101rila can\nbe taken similarly to have urged, in pressing his case for the\neternality of language, that we can only imagine thinking to\nconsist in \u201ctalking to oneself\u201d\u2014and that to\nunderstand that is to understand something more than just\nwhat things are called. What Kum\u0101rila challenges his\nNy\u0101ya and Buddhist opponents to explain, then, is where we get the\nvery idea of meaning\u00a0 something, and in what that\nconsists.\n\n\nKum\u0101rila thus argues that the irreducible givenness of\nlanguage\u2014its always already being there\u2014is a condition\nof the possibility of there being any particular speech acts, and of\nany thought such as might explain these. Particularly as\nagainst the essentially psychologistic account of language to be\ngleaned from the Buddhist Dharmak\u012brti, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s view\ncan be understood to credit something of the irreducibly social\ncharacter of language, which is to be understood on this view as having\nan essentially mind-independent reality; the possibility of\nmeaning anything cannot be explained with reference to the\ngoings-on in any particular minds. It might reasonably be\nsaid, then, that while Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s apoha doctrine\namounts to a paradigm case of what V. N. Volosinov characterized as\n\u201cindividualistic subjectivism,\u201d Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\naccount paradigmatically exemplifies the alternative pole that\nVolosinov characterized as \u201cabstract objectivism.\u201d (On\nthese arguments, see Arnold 2006, and 2012, Chapter 4; Taber\n[forthcoming]. See, as well, Volosinov 1986, 45\u201363.)\n3.2 On the reality of linguistic universals\n\n\nIt is important to note, with respect to Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ncharacteristically M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka intuitions about language,\nthat the word \u015babda\u2014which often means\n\u201cword,\u201d as in the fifth of Jaimini\u2019s\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 S\u016btras, where it is\nrelations between \u015babda and referents (artha)\nthat are said to be primordial\u2014is essentially ambiguous between\nwhat Saussure distinguished as langue and parole.\nThus, the same word can also refer generally to\n\u201csound,\u201d in the sense denoting any object of the\nauditory sense faculty. To that extent, \u015babda can be\nunderstood as referring either to language as such\n(Saussure\u2019s langue), or to particular, temporally describable\noccasions of linguistic utterance (Saussure\u2019s\nparole). It thus becomes clear that arguments for thinking that\n\u015babda is eternal will seem rather different depending on\nwhich of these senses one takes to be in play. Buddhists, especially\ninsofar as they are typically apt to focus on particular occasions of\nuse, find it obviously true that (as on one favored Buddhist example of\na formally stated inference) \u201c\u015babda is impermanent,\nbecause it is produced,\u201d just like artifacts like jars (which we\nknow to be both produced on particular occasions, and essentially\nimpermanent). The Buddhist claim is less obviously compelling, however, if instead\none takes it that \u015babda denotes always already available\nconditions of the possibility of any particular utterance\u2019s\ncounting as linguistic.\n\n\nStill, while it is surely appropriate thus to credit\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s arguments for the eternality of language with\ncapturing profound insights regarding our linguistic being, the case\nfor his account of the eternality of language is greatly complicated by\nthe fact that Kum\u0101rila actually holds, in a way, that it is in\nboth of the foregoing senses of the word that\n\u015babda should be understood as eternal; on his view, that\nis, it is not only linguistic universals that are timeless, but also\nthe phonemes that manifest these. This view reflects, no\ndoubt, characteristically M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka commitments,\ncentering on the category of mantra, about the\nVedas\u2014commitments, in particular, about the inherent power not\nonly of language as such, but of properly uttered Sanskrit sentences\nto\nbring into being the states of affairs they concern. Many\nBrahmanical texts preserve, in this regard, a famous story of the\nsignificance of precise transmission of the text:\u00a0 wishing, by\nuttering the nominal compound Indra*ndash;\u015batru (which could\nmean \u201cconqueror of Indra\u201d), to make his son triumphant, the\nmythical figure of Tva\u1e63\u1e6dar instead ensured his son\u2019s\ndeath by pronouncing the compound so that it had the sense of an\nadjectival, bahuvr\u012bhi compound (\u201chaving Indra as\nconqueror\u201d)\u2014with the latter state of affairs then brought\ninto being by his utterance.\n\n\nIt is perhaps insofar as he was attuned to such a view of the\nsignificance of Vedic language that Kum\u0101rila was apt to eschew\ntypically holistic understandings of meaning, and instead to hold the\nkind of atomistic view on which individual phonemes can be thought part\nof what is eternal about language. Kum\u0101rila was, in this regard,\ncritical of the Sanskrit grammarians\u2019 spho\u1e6da\n(\u201cbursting forth\u201d) theory of meaning, which had been\nelaborated precisely to account for the expression of meaning in light\nof the manifestly temporal character of linguistic utterance.\nThe considerations here in play are not unlike those that preoccupied\nHusserl in his On the Phenomenology of the Consciousness of\nInternal Time (1991); just, then, as Husserl was led to venture\nthat the seemingly instantaneous present of consciousness must somehow\ncomprise something of the past and future if we are to account for\nthings like the musical experience of melody, so, too, Sanskritic\nthinkers had wondered how to account for the dawning of\nmeaning relative to the necessarily temporal unfolding of any\nsentence one could encounter. At the moment, for example, when the last\nphoneme of a sentence is uttered, the initial phonemes are no longer\npresent; at what point, then, are we to say that the sentence\u2019s\nmeaning is experienced, and how are we to account for that\nwith regard to the necessarily vanished moments that are involved?\n\n\nWhile proponents of the spho\u1e6da (or \u201cbursting\nforth\u201d) theory had urged that we must, in this regard, posit the\nsudden dawning of something akin to a unitary proposition\n(which might, indeed, be taken as the sense of the word\nspho\u1e6da in this context), Kum\u0101rila instead argued\nthat understanding\u2014whether of sentences, or just of\nindividual words\u2014can be explained with reference to\nmemory of discrete phonemes, and that reference to anything over and\nabove the phonemes was therefore unnecessary. Similarly, Kum\u0101rila\neschewed the holistic account of sentence-meaning\u2014called\nanvit\u0101bhidh\u0101nav\u0101da, the doctrine that a\nsentence is \u201cthe expressed meaning of a series [of words]\u201d\n(per Brough, 1953, 416)\u2014advanced by Prabh\u0101kara, who\nwould argue that complete sentences represent the basic unit of\nmeaning. Instead, Kum\u0101rila held the so-called\nabhihit\u0101nvayav\u0101da doctrine\u2014the view that a\nsentence is \u201ca series of expressed word-meanings\u201d (Brough,\n416)\u2014on which sentence-meaning is essentially analyzable in\nterms of word-meanings that are independently intelligible. Against,\nthen, the kind of holistic view on which the sense of a word is to be\nknown chiefly from substitution in sentences, Kum\u0101rila argued\n(just as he had against the spho\u1e6da theory) that\n\u201cas the words are uttered in a sentence, each word performs its\ntask of expressing its meaning, and the sentence is the summation of\nthese meanings.\u201d (Brough, 415; see, as well, Kunjunni Raja\n1963, Matilal 1990, Siderits 1991.)\n\n\nWhile such atomistic views might not be judged very promising, and\nwhile they are not obviously required by (and may even seem in tension\nwith) such intuitions as that language essentially transcends\nindividual occasions of use, they fit well with Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nadditional commitment to thinking that the phonemes of Vedic Sanskrit\nare part of what is eternal in language\u2014though it is surely\ndifficult to imagine how something as eminently temporal as\nsound could thus be reckoned as in any sense\ntimeless. Notwithstanding his counter-intuitive commitment to\neternally existent phonemes, Kum\u0101rila was also an uncompromising\nrealist about more clearly abstract universals, taking it, for example,\nthat the referents of kind-terms are real properties such as being\na cow. (See Scharf 1996.) This comes through not only in\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s philosophy of language, but also in his\nepistemology; against, then, Buddhists who argued (with Dign\u0101ga\nand Dharmak\u012brti) that perception is essentially non-conceptual,\nKum\u0101rila firmly held that perceptions, properly speaking,\nimmediately yield justified beliefs regarding things as the\nkinds of things they are; that perception thus discloses things\nunder some description shows, among other things, that the\nkinds of conceptual items that figure in descriptions are real.\n\n\nOne can really see, that is, not only particular bovine\ncritters, but also the fact of their exemplifying go-tva, the\nproperty of \u201cbeing a cow\u201d; this is just what it means to\nperceive any such particular as a cow. This is among\nthe points regarding which Kum\u0101rila found it apt to deploy the\nepistemological doctrine of immediate justification; thus, among the\nreasons why it cannot reasonably be denied that properties like\nbeing a cow are real is that there is nothing that finally\nfalsifies the many justified beliefs we have concerning things that are\nperceived as exemplifying just such properties. Insofar, that is, as we\nare prima facie justified in thinking of something perceived as\nbeing a cow really to be cow, and insofar as no overriding\ncognition is forthcoming, we are entitled to think the perceived fact\nof its being a cow is real. (See, on these lines of thought,\nTaber\u2019s 2005 translation of the\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika\u2019s chapter on perception.)\n\n\nWith respect to the question of how timeless properties like being\na cow relate to the individuals that \u201cmanifest\u201d them\n(tokens are in this context referred to as vyakti,\n\u201cmanifestations\u201d of types), Kum\u0101rila aimed to finesse\nthe issue that bedeviled Brahmanical proponents of the Ny\u0101ya\nschool. Thus, Naiy\u0101yikas characteristically invoked the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika category of \u201cinherence\u201d\n(samav\u0101ya), holding that an \u201cinherence\u201d\nrelation obtained between universals and the particulars that\ninstantiate them. Criticizing the Ny\u0101ya account on the grounds\nthat thus positing an intermediary category to do the work of\nrelating the two different kinds of things just opens up an\ninfinite regress, Kum\u0101rila instead held a view with affinities to\nthe kind of perspectivalism that is generally characteristic of Jaina\nphilosophy; on this view, \u201cuniversal\u201d and\n\u201cparticular\u201d represent different aspects of the same\nthings, with neither aspect being finally intelligible apart from the\nother. (See, e.g., \u015alokav\u0101rttika,\n\u0101k\u1e5btiv\u0101da 8, ff.; Jha, trans., 1983, 282,\nff.)\n3.3 Presumption, \u201cap\u016brva,\u201d and the nature of the self\n\n\nAmong the grounds for certain of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s claims regarding\nuniversals is the epistemic practice of arth\u0101patti, or\n\u201cnecessary presumption.\u201d This represents a doxastic\npractice admitted as distinct (i.e., as a pram\u0101\u1e47a)\nonly by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, with proponents of other schools of\nthought having regarded this as indistinct from inference\n(anum\u0101na). If there is a difference from inference as\nthat doxastic practice was systematized by Indian philosophers, it is\nperhaps that arth\u0101patti will not as readily admit of\nformalization; this represents, then, something more like inference\nto the best explanation\u2014the presumption or\n\u201cpositing\u201d (kalpan\u0101) of something without\nwhich some explanandum would not make sense. According to a stock\nexample, it must be supposed, of a corpulent person who never eats\nduring the daytime, that he eats at night. Kum\u0101rila appealed to\nthis mode of reasoning to argue, for example, for the necessity of\npositing universals as the referents of words; thus, what one\nunderstands, on rightly taking the meaning of a word, is that\n(a universal) without which the word\u2019s communicative\ncapacity would not be intelligible.\n\n\nThe same epistemic procedure is invoked, as well, to offer a peculiar\nalternative to the characteristically Buddhist view that awareness is\ninherently reflexive (that all awareness, that is, involves\nsvasa\u1e43vitti, or \u201cself-awareness\u201d).\nProfoundly wary of the significance of self-awareness in Buddhist\narguments for idealism\u2014Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s arguments for\nthe foundational character of self-awareness, for example, amount to a\ncase at least for the kind of epistemic idealism on which the\ndirect objects of awareness are mental representations (see Arnold\n2008)\u2014Kum\u0101rila was at pains to disallow that awareness is\nessentially reflexive. Against that idea, he held the counter-intuitive view that\nour awareness of ourselves as being aware is in fact a\npresumption from j\u00f1\u0101tat\u0101, the fact of\nsomething\u2019s \u201cbeing known.\u201d From the occurrence of an\nact of \u201cbeing known,\u201d that is, we presume there to have\nbeen an act of knowing, though that is not itself part of the\ncontent of our awareness. Lest this seem a manifestly untenable idea,\nit is worth noting that the broadly Sanskritic discussion of these\nissues typically took its bearings from grammarians\u2019 analyses of\nthe various factors relatable to a verb in any sentence; thus,\nKum\u0101rila, like other Indian philosophers who argued against the\nBuddhist doctrine of self-awareness, urged that it is incoherent to\nhold that the same thing could at once be agent and\npatient of a single act\u2014and if it is counter-intuitive\nto think, with Kum\u0101rila, of something\u2019s \u201cbeing\nknown\u201d prior to or independently of a subject\u2019s\nknowing that, it may make a difference that the guiding\nidea of \u201cbeing known\u201d is that of an act such as can be\nreferred to. \u201cBeing known,\u201d then, is here thought to\ncharacterize the objects of such acts, and is therefore not\nsomething itself to be known by introspection. (For a sympathetic reconstruction of this doctrine in a different context, see Siderits 2011.)\n\n\nMost controversially, Kum\u0101rila invoked the epistemic practice of\n\u201cnecessary presumption\u201d in arguing (at great length in the\nTantrav\u0101rttika) for the category of ap\u016brva,\nwhich it is hard not to consider a basically ad hoc category\nmeant to account for the efficacy of Vedic sacrificial rites.\nAp\u016brva denotes, then, the temporally remote consequences\nof ritual acts\u2014what it is, in other words, in virtue of which a\ncorrectly performed Vedic rite can be judged efficacious, even in the\nabsence of any immediately observed effect of the expected kind. The\nfelt need to posit such an entity follows from Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nconvictions regarding the epistemic claim that is made (at least upon\nthe right kind of person) by Vedic injunctions. Thus, insofar as one\ncan (as Kum\u0101rila argued in elaborating the epistemology sketched\nin \u00a72, above) justifiably hold that Vedic injunctions make\ncontentful claims about matters of ultimate importance, and insofar as\nthe rites enjoined thereby are manifestly temporal events that are yet\nsaid to bear on always \u201cyet-to-be-realized\u201d states of\naffairs, it must be the case that something relates present, temporally\noccurrent ritual performances to the essentially imperceptible realm of\ndharma; for otherwise, the Vedic injunctions would be\nmeaningless.\n\n\nHere again, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s arguments relate closely to\nlinguistic preoccupations in light of which the point he makes can seem\nmore interesting than it might at first. With respect, then, to the\nquestion of what, in the Vedic texts, refers to the obscure\n\u201cap\u016brva\u201d he has thus posited, Kum\u0101rila\nholds that this should finally be understood as the referent of\nverbs; for nouns essentially denote already present things,\nwhereas it is verbs in virtue of which injunctive sentences enjoin\nactions that are always to be completed. (See, e.g.,\nTantrav\u0101rttika 2.2.1, ff.; and\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika,\nv\u0101ky\u0101dhikara\u1e47a, 330, ff.)\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s arguments here track, then, an often-cited\nhermeneutical maxim favored by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas:\u00a0\n\u201cwhat exists conduces to what is to be brought into being\u201d\n(bh\u016bta\u1e43 bhavy\u0101ya kalpate). It is, in other\nwords, the state of affairs whose \u201crealization\u201d\n(bh\u0101van\u0101) is expressed by the verb that should be\njudged predominant particularly in the injunctive sentences that\nrepresent, for M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43akas, the most important parts of\nthe Vedas. (See McCrea 2000.) So, just insofar as they refer to\nalready-present things, nouns refer to things that are essentially\nsubordinated to the realization (the\nbh\u0101van\u0101, or \u201cmaking real\u201d) of the\nacts that are what such sentences primarily enjoin; insofar,\nthen, as it is reasonable to think that verbs, too, must have\nreferents, and insofar as these referents are always essentially\nyet to be realized, Kum\u0101rila thinks it necessary to posit\nap\u016brva (the temporally remote consequence of ritual acts)\nas being, as it were, the \u201creferents\u201d of verbs. (See\nClooney 1990, 239, ff.; Halbfass 1991, 300\u2013307)\n\n\nOnce again, Kum\u0101rila can here be seen to take his bearings\nfrom the thought that what matters most is what is disclosed by the\nunique capacity of language somehow to bring into view\u2014indeed,\nto bring into being\u2014a world beyond what is actually\npresent. Kum\u0101rila\u2019s richly elaborated sense of our linguistic\nbeing thus reflects, above all, a guiding commitment to the view that\nVedic injunctions essentially enjoin the ongoing bringing into\nbeing of a ritual world that must continually be\nrenewed\u2014that, indeed, the world itself is sustained by Vedic\nsacrifice, which is rationally undertaken chiefly insofar as the texts\nthat enjoin this essentially transcend any particular human\nperspective.\n\n\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s confidence in the genuinely referential nature of\nlanguage is also reflected, finally, in his characteristic arguments\nfor the idea that it is an enduring \u0101tman\n(\u201cself\u201d) that is the underlying subject of all of our\nactions (and that therefore stands to realize, in the future, the\nfruits of Vedic practices). Like thinkers in the Brahmanical Ny\u0101ya\ntradition of philosophy, Kum\u0101rila (here closely following\n\u015aabara) was concerned to vindicate this conviction particularly in\nthe face of Buddhist arguments to the contrary (the claim that persons\nare \u201cwithout self,\u201d or an\u0101tma, being a\ncardinal Buddhist doctrine). Kum\u0101rila\u2019s intuitions in this\nregard center on the thought that \u201cthe notion\n\u2018I\u2019\u201d (aha\u1e43-pratyaya) must have a real\nreferent. That this is so, he argues, is directly experienced in the\ncase of memory, the content of which constitutively involves reference\nto \u201cI\u201d as the subject of past experiences now remembered.\nIn contrast, then, to arguments (such as those offered by many\nproponents of Ny\u0101ya) to the effect that memory\npresupposes an enduring subject, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ndistinctive claim is that in the always first-personally indexed\ncontent of mnemonic experience we really\n\u201cencounter\u201d the referent of the first-person pronoun.\nInsofar, that is, as it doesn\u2019t make sense to think one might\nremember an experience, and at the same time be uncertain about\nwhose experience it is that\u2019s remembered, it must be\nthought that there is in this case genuine \u201crecognition\u201d\n(pratyabhij\u00f1\u0101) of the referent of \u201cthe\nnotion \u2018I\u2019.\u201d (See, especially,\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika, \u0101tmav\u0101da, verses\n107\u2013110; Jha 1983, trans., 401\u201302; Taber 1990.)\n\n\nInterestingly, Buddhists like Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti take\nthe phenomenologically second-order character of memory here identified\nby Kum\u0101rila\u2014the fact, that is, that mnemonic awareness is phenomenologically\ndistinct from present awareness in virtue of the explicitly reflexive character of memory\u2014as evidence only that moments of awareness have a reflexive aspect. That momentary mental states are thus characterized by their \u201cself-awareness\u201d is, for these Buddhists, nothing like awareness of a self; rather, it is something like the fact that moments of cognition are self-intimating. (On svasa\u1e43vitti, see Ganeri 1999, Kellner 2010, Thompson 2011.)\n\n\nKum\u0101rila, we noted at the beginning of this section, is deeply\nresistant to the Buddhist doctrine of self-awareness, insofar as that\nis enlisted by these Buddhists as evidence for the idealist claim that\nwe are, finally, indubitably aware only of the content of our own\nmental states. Against, though, the Buddhist appeal to the\nphenomenologically distinctive character of memory, Kum\u0101rila can\nargue that it is not moments of subjectivity that we encounter in memory, but rather the fact that the subject who now remembers is the same\nas the subject disclosed in the remembered experience. Not momentariness but continuity is the most phenomenologically salient feature of memory\u2014and insofar as Kum\u0101rila here again takes his bearings from the guiding epistemological intuition that we are generally justified in taking awareness\nas veridically disclosing just what it seems to us to disclose. While Buddhists like Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti propose, then,\nan explanation of personhood that is counter-intuitive in light of the\nphenomenally continuous character of awareness, Kum\u0101rila\ncan again invoke his characteristic epistemological doctrine; thus, he\nargues not only that we are prima facie justified in believing\nourselves really to be as we seem (particularly in the case of\nmemory) to ourselves to be, but also that there is finally nothing that\ncan be taken to override that conviction. (See \u0101tmav\u0101da\nverses 125\u201326 [Jha 1983, 405], and, as well, Taber 1990.)\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s account of the self, then, represents another expression of the common-sense realism that informs his entire project.\n4. Ideology and ethics\n\n\nThat Kum\u0101rila can so often enlist common-sense intuitions in\ndefense of his project, however, might be thought in tension with such\nsurely non-commonsensical ideas as that there is a mysterious\n\u201cap\u016brva\u201d connecting the eminently temporal\nacts of Vedic practitioners to the always \u201cyet-to-be\u201d\ndharma from which M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas take their\nbearings\u2014and in tension, as well, with\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s foundational appeal to an\nessentially authorless corpus of Sanskrit texts. Indeed,\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s philosophically sophisticated efforts thus to\ndetach characteristically Vedic claims from any finite human\nperspective can be understood as rather insidious. It is not beside the\npoint to note in this regard that the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\ntradition he advanced can be characterized (as by Sheldon Pollock) as\n\u201cthe dominant orthodox discourse of traditional India\u201d\n(1989, 604); for it is at least arguably the case that it is\nprecisely the appeal to the transcendent character of the Vedas that\nsecured M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s dominance, and that\nthe securing of dominance was just the point of that\nappeal. That is surely as some of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s critics argued; proponents of the skeptical\n\u201cC\u0101rv\u0101ka\u201d school of thought, for example, argued that the various\naspects of the Vedic worldview were all introduced by Brahmins simply in\norder to secure their own livelihood as the adjudicators of that\ntradition. Whether or not that represents a reasonable account of the\naims of Kum\u0101rila and other M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, it is\nsurely a defensible view at least that such ideological effects were\namong the upshots of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka influence. Sheldon\nPollock has recurrently argued, in this vein, that the dominance\nachieved by proponents of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka project is\nreflected in widespread Indic conceptions of authoritative discourse in\ngeneral\u2014conceptions such as Kum\u0101rila himself advanced with\nhis arguments concerning, e.g., the epistemic status of the vast corpus\nof Brahmanical literature (generally styled sm\u1e5bti,\n\u201ctradition\u201d) that extends beyond the Vedic corpus\n(contrastively styled \u015bruti,\n\u201crevelation\u201d).\n\n\nThus, Kum\u0101rila argued at length in the\nTantrav\u0101rttika (e.g., 1.3.1, ff.) that traditional\nliterature can be accepted as authoritative just insofar as it\nexhibits the property of \u201cbeing rooted in the Vedas\u201d\n(vedam\u016blatvam)\u2014even if that means, in some cases,\ninferring the reality of a no-longer-accessible Vedic text as the\nbasis for retaining manifestly important traditions that do not\nobviously stem from any extant Vedic text. Chief among the upshots of\nthis is that what Kum\u0101rila and other M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas\ntook to be the basis for the distinctive epistemic status of the\nVedas\u2014namely, their being transcendently\n\u201cimpersonal\u201d (apauru\u1e63eya)\u2014was\neffectively claimed, as well, for whole traditions of learning\nostensibly relatable to the Vedas. As Pollock has suggested,\n\u201cother sorts of Brahmanical intellectual practices seeking to\nlegitimate their truth-claims had perforce to conform to this special\nmodel of what counts as knowledge, and so to suppress the evidence of\ntheir own historical existence.\u201d (1989, 609; see, as well,\nHalbfass 1991, passim)\n\n\nThe characteristically M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka claim that the Vedas\nare eternal can thus be understood to inform a pan-Sanskritic episteme\nsuch as lends itself to the sort of analysis that is characteristic of\nPierre Bourdieu, according to whom \u201cevery established order tends\nto produce (to very different degrees and with very different means)\nthe naturalization of its own arbitrariness.\u201d (Bourdieu 1977,\n164) The enormous influence of philosophical projects such as\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s, that is, arguably had the effect of masking the\nspecifically located and interested character particularly of\nBrahmanical claims to authority, giving historical and contingent\nclaims the status that goes with their supposedly just reflecting\nthe way things are. It is not unreasonable, then, to see in\nthe success of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s project a paradigm case of the\nkind of historical situation in which, as Bourdieu puts it, \u201cthe\nestablished cosmological and political order is perceived not as\narbitrary, i.e. as one possible order among others, but as a\nself-evident and natural order which goes without saying and therefore\ngoes unquestioned.\u201d (ibid., 165\u20136) To that extent,\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s philosophy would seem readily to admit of the\nkind of ideology critique advanced, following Bourdieu, by Pollock.\n\n\nWhile that is not an unreasonable characterization of the context and\nimplications of his philosophy, Kum\u0101rila can also be read as\narguing for a radical de-centering of individual aims and\nprojects\u2014for the relativization of all claims and goals to an\nessentially linguistic reality that is above all distinguished by its\nvastly exceeding any particular\nperspective. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas typically distinguished, in\nthis regard, between dimensions of Vedic practice that are essentially\n\u201cfor the sake of the person\u201d\n(puru\u1e63\u0101rtha), and those that are \u201cfor the\nsake of the sacrifice\u201d (kratvartha)\u2014and in the\nfinal analysis, it is the latter dimensions that are of ultimate\nsignificance for proponents of the Vedic worldview defended by\nKum\u0101rila. (This interpretation is advanced by Clooney 1990,\n163, ff.) While Kum\u0101rila\u2019s robust realism surely extended,\nthen, to the thought that the selves persons typically take\nthemselves to be are real\u2014that, e.g., the referential character\nof the first-person pronoun discloses something that is really the\ncase\u2014there is an important sense in which his project can be\ntaken finally to cut against the pursuit of any self-centered\nagenda. Emphasizing, to similar effect, some profound intuitions that\ncan be understood as reflected in the doctrine of the transcendence of\nthe Vedas, J. N. Mohanty has suggested that the salient point of this\nclaim is that \u201cthe intention of the author is not relevant for\nunderstanding the texts. The text itself is primary and\nautonomous.\u201d (2007, 65)\n\n\nExemplifying, that is, a long-standing tradition that has always\nalready preceded the individuals who find themselves constituted\nthereby, the Vedas, on the understanding of them commended by Mohanty,\n\u201cconstitute the founding texts for the Hindu world by opening up\nthe horizon \u2026 within which the tradition has understood itself\nand [within which] we who belong to that tradition have understood\nourselves.\u201d (ibid.) Mohanty, then, not implausibly finds\nit possible to see a basically Gadamerian thought reflected in the idea\nof the Vedas as authorless, and thus to emphasize the character of\nthese as representing a horizon for (rather than a constraint\non) ethical thinking:\u00a0 \u201cThe Hindu understanding of\ndharma as embodied in the imperatives laid down in the [Vedas]\npreserves the idea of ethics as rooted solidly in that tradition which\nwas founded by those texts, but which those texts have permitted us to\nreinterpret ever anew.\u201d (ibid.) While this is an\ninterestingly profound characterization of some of the insights driving\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s project, it is no less reasonable to emphasize,\nas well, that insofar as Kum\u0101rila\u2019s arguments helped secure\nfor M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas the status of privileged arbiters of\nthis ongoing \u201creinterpretation,\u201d questions of power and\nauthority remain ineliminable from an understanding of what he was up\nto.\n",
