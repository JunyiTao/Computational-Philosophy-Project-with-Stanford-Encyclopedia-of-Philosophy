    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nAs with many of his contemporaries, we know very few dates with\ncertainty in the life of Peter Auriol (a.k.a. Peter Auriole, Peter\nAureol, Petrus Aureoli, the Doctor Facundus). On the basis of\nhis later career it seems reasonable to suppose that Auriol was born\naround 1280, and we have evidence that he originated in the region\nnear the city of Cahors in France. We know that Auriol joined the\nFranciscan order in the order\u2019s province of Aquitania, and we\nsurmise that this took place sometime before 1300. From the structure\nof the contemporary Franciscan educational system we can deduce that\nhe studied in Paris sometime in the first decade of the fourteenth\ncentury, but evidence that some scholars have presented that Auriol\nheard Scotus in Paris or was definitely in Paris in 1304 is\ninconclusive. Auriol\u2019s first written work, dealing with the\nissue of Franciscan poverty (Tractatus de paupertate et usu\npaupere), seems to have been composed in 1311 or at latest early\n1312. In the latter year we know that Auriol was teaching in Bologna,\npresumably at the Franciscan convent in that city. It was here that he\nauthored his Tractatus de principiis naturae (Treatise on\nthe principles of nature), his only non-theological work. By the\nend of 1314, Auriol was in Toulouse, again apparently teaching at the\nFranciscan convent, and it seems that the two treatises that he\nauthored in support of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary\n(and in opposition to Dominican critics of that view) stem from this\ntime (Tractatus de conceptione Beatae Mariae Virginis and\nRepercussorium). In one or both of these cities, Auriol must\nhave also been lecturing on the standard medieval theological\ntextbook, the Sentences of Peter Lombard, and his massive\ncommentary on the first book of the Sentences, his\nScriptum super primum Sententiarum \u2014 more than 1100\nfolio pages in its early modern printing (Rome 1596) \u2014 was\nalmost certainly substantially finished by the autumn of 1316 when\nAuriol arrived in Paris, sent by the Franciscan order to earn his\ndoctorate. We used to think that Auriol read the Sentences at\nParis 1316\u201318, but new research has shown that he did this there\nover the sole academic year 1317-18 (Duba and Schabel 2017, esp. pp.\n159-165). No less a figure than Pope John XXII, Auriol\u2019s mentor,\nwrote to the Chancellor of Paris in a letter dated July 14, 1318,\nasking that Auriol be granted the doctorate. The letter served its\npurpose, and by late 1318 he was the Franciscan regent master in\ntheology there. Auriol served as regent master in Paris until 1320 or\n1321, lecturing on the Bible (from which resulted several extant\nbiblical commentaries), and holding at least one series of quodlibetal\ndisputations. In 1321, he was elevated by John XXII to the position of\nArchbishop of Aix-en-Provence, but Auriol died soon after taking\noffice, probably on January 22, 1322. (See, for more details, Teetaert\n1935, and esp. Buytaert 1952).\n\nAs should be clear from the above, Auriol\u2019s extant works are\npredominantly theological in nature, having been composed in\nconnection with his duties as a theological student and teacher.\nNevertheless, especially his commentary on Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences is a treasure trove of philosophical thought\nspanning a vast range of issues in metaphysics, epistemology and\nphilosophy of mind, natural philosophy, and ethics; it is in addition\nhis most important and influential work. We possess several versions\nof Auriol\u2019s Sentences commentary. Besides the\nScriptum, which, as mentioned above, was mostly composed\nbefore Auriol arrived in Paris in the autumn of 1316, we have\nreportationes (student transcripts) of lectures that Auriol\nheld on all four books of the Sentences, some of which have\nobviously been reworked to one degree or another by Auriol himself and\nsome of which are still found only in medieval manuscripts. A version\nof his commentary on books II-IV was published in Rome in 1605 (along\nwith Auriol\u2019s single Quodlibet of sixteen questions).\nIn part because the project to critically edit all of Auriol\u2019s\nworks has been initiated only recently, the complex relationship\nbetween these published texts and other versions, found only in\nmanuscripts, as well as the relationship between the published\nScriptum and the extant reportationes on book I of\nthe Sentences, is not entirely clear. (See however, Nielsen\n2002; Schabel 2000a, pp. 67\u201376; Schabel 2000b; Duba 2000; for\nmore information on Auriol\u2019s works, see the bibliography on the\nPeter Auriol Homepage (Other Internet Resources).)\n",
