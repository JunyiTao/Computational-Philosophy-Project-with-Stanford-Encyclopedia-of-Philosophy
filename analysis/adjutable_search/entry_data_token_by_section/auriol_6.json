Cognition and Reality: Conceptualism and the esse apparens\n\nIf there is one thing that is known about Peter Auriol, it is that he\nwas a \u201cconceptualist.\u201d Indeed, Auriol has often been\nviewed as a forerunner of William Ockham precisely on account of his\nconceptualism. What is probably the very first monograph ever devoted\nto Auriol (Dreiling 1913) deals with his conceptualism. Thus,\nunderstanding Auriol\u2019s conceptualism is a good place to start\nwhen dealing with Auriol\u2019s thought.\n\nIn fact, Auriol is a conceptualist. By this it is merely\nmeant that, for Auriol, only singulars (i.e. individuals) have real,\nextra-mental existence. As Auriol writes: \u201cevery thing, insofar\nas it exists, exists as a singular\u201d (omnis res, eo quod est,\nsingulariter est). Moreover, Auriol states explicitly that there\nis no principle of individuation \u2014 individuals just are\nindividuals and their individuality needs no further explanation. This\nis one of the most basic of Auriol\u2019s metaphysical principles,\nand it necessarily entails that universality and universals are mental\nphenomena, fabricated in some way by the intellect. Thus, for Auriol,\nthe individuality of singular things does not need explaining, but the\nformation of universal concepts on the basis of these individuals does\nneed explaining. What is important for understanding Auriol\u2019s\nconceptualism, then, is explicating his theory of intellectual\ncognition: determining the process by which the intellect fabricates\nthese universal concepts, determining what these universal concepts\nare, and what relation they have to really existing singulars in the\nworld.\n\nWhile only individuals have real, extra-mental existence, every\nindividual by its very nature has several different ontological or\nquidditative aspects. Auriol calls these quidditative aspects\nrationes (a term that will remain untranslated in the rest of\nthis entry). Thus, Auriol claims that, e.g., Socrates has the\nrationes substance, corporeality, sensitivity, rationality.\nMoreover, rationes of the same kind found in different\nindividuals are \u201cmaximally similar\u201d (simillimae).\ne.g., Socrates\u2019 corporeality is totally like Plato\u2019s\ncorporeality, which is totally like the donkey Brunellus\u2019\ncorporeality. It should be noted that these rationes are\nnon-universal characteristics, i.e. a ratio belongs to one\nand only one individual. This is why Auriol emphasizes the maximal\nsimilarity of rationes of the same kind: they are not the\nsame and they are not shared, they are merely as alike as they can be.\nWhat is most important about these rationes in the present\ncontext is that they are the basic unit of intellectual acquaintance:\nevery ratio of its very nature is able to serve as the basis\nfor a concept, although the concept that results from the intellection\nof a ratio can be modified by the way that we conceive it\n(our modus concipiendi), a purely psychological difference\nwith no immediate grounds in extra-mental reality. We might say that a\nratio directs our intellect to form one certain concept, this\ncore concept undergoing modification according to the way we conceive\nit. Our universal concepts, then, have in these rationes a\ndirect basis in extra-mental individuals. (See, for more on this,\nFriedman 1999, W\u00f6ller 2015, pp. 36\u201379; for the term\n\u2018maximally similar\u2019 [as it is used in Ockham], see\nPanaccio 1992, pp. 258\u201367.) What universal concept we actually\nform, according to Auriol, depends on how closely our will makes the\nintellect focus on the information we receive from the object of\ncognition, and hence how strong an impression the object makes on the\nintellect: the more closely focused, the stronger the impression, the\nmore specific the universal concept that is formed.\n\nTo understand further what universal concepts are, we need to know\nwhat Auriol thinks concepts in general are. Central to this is\nAuriol\u2019s theory of apparent existence or esse apparens,\nthat, at all levels, our cognitive faculties, in the very process of\ncognizing, put the object of cognition into a special type of\nexistence, termed by Auriol \u201capparent existence\u201d (esse\napparens). For Auriol, in line with the general medieval view,\nour cognitive apparatus is divided into a sensory part (including the\nfive external senses, the common sense, which puts the sense data from\nthe five external senses together, and the imagination, which stores,\nretrieves, and sometimes manipulates the sense data, as well as sends\nthem on to the intellect) and an intellectual part (including the\nagent and the possible intellect). According to Auriol, in any\ncognitive act \u2014 whether sensory or intellectual \u2014 the\ncognitive power puts the object of cognition into this special type of\nexistence, and the object of cognition in this special type of\nexistence is the object as perceived. Thus concepts as well\nas sensations are simply cognized things themselves in a type of\nexistence different from that which they have in extra-mental reality.\nAuriol employs at least two different approaches to argue for this\nview: one based on intellectual cognition, the other based on sensory\ncognition. (Auriol\u2019s trinitarian theology provides further\narguments for this view; see Friedman 2013, esp. Ch. 9, section 4.)\nWe\u2019ll look at each of these in turn, in the process sketching\nwhat it was about the theory of esse apparens that made it\nquite radical and disturbing to Auriol\u2019s medieval readers. (For\nthe sake of precision, esse apparens will go untranslated\nhereafter.)\n\nIntellectual cognition (see Friedman 1999;\nAdriaenssen 2014, esp. pp. 85\u201395; Friedman 2015; Adriaenssen\n2017a, pp. 82\u201399): Auriol\u2019s solution to the question of\nwhat a concept is takes its point of departure in the necessity of\nexplaining three things at once: essential predication; intellectual\nacquaintance with extra-mental objects; and necessary, scientific\nknowledge. Auriol holds that the first of these explanatory\nrequirements would not be fulfilled by any theory of concepts\naccording to which the concept is a type of representation or token of\nthe thing, if this representation has real \u2014 albeit mental\n\u2014 being. Examples that he gives of solutions of this sort are\nthat a concept might be the intellectual act or an intelligible\nspecies or any type of accident terminating an act of the\nunderstanding. All of these representations have some real being of\ntheir own. According to Auriol, these types of representational\ntheories of concepts would make explaining essential predication\nimpossible, since, assuming any of them, when I predicated, e.g.,\nanimal of human being, I would make a false predication, inasmuch as\nthe concept human being would not be the concept animal. The\nultimate problem with theories of universals of this sort, according\nto Auriol, is that if they were correct, then universals would not be\nuniversals at all, but would be particulars with their own real being.\nMoreover, not only these same types of representational views of\nconcepts, but also any theory that holds concepts to be Platonic\nIdeas, would hinder us in having intellectual acquaintance with\nextra-mental objects, Auriol\u2019s second explanatory requirement.\nOn both these types of theories, our knowledge would extend only to\nthese really existing entities. We would, according to Auriol, be\nintellectually blind to extra-mental reality. On the other hand, we\ncould certainly have intellectual acquaintance with extra-mental\nobjects, if our concepts were particular things in the extra-mental\nworld as they exist extra-mentally \u2014 a final position Auriol\ncriticizes \u2014 but we would be unable to have necessary,\nscientific knowledge, Auriol\u2019s third explanatory requirement. In\nfact, we would be unable to make universal judgments of any kind,\nsince there would be nothing universal about our knowledge; instead of\nknowing that all mules are sterile, we would know only that this mule\nis sterile and that that mule is sterile.\n\nHaving considered all these views and found them wanting, Auriol\noffers his own alternative: the only way to explain at once essential\npredication, intellectual acquaintance with extra-mental objects, and\nnecessary, scientific knowledge is to maintain that concepts\nare extra-mental particulars, but having a different type of\nexistence (modus essendi) from the real existence they have\nextra-mentally. This special type of existence Auriol terms esse\napparens, apparent being, but he uses many synonyms for it,\nincluding \u201cintentional\u201d or \u201cobjective\u201d\nexistence. (For other synonyms, see Tachau 1988, p. 90.) What\ncharacterizes this type of existence is that it is a particular\nextra-mental object, e.g., Socrates, but indistinguishably mixed\ntogether (indistinguibiliter immiscetur) with\npassive conception, i.e. the formation of a concept of Socrates. A\nconcept of Socrates is Socrates as conceived.\n\nFor Auriol, Socrates and a concept grasping Socrates, then, are the\nsame thing with differing types of existence. That they are \u201cthe\nsame thing\u201d Auriol means quite literally. He says that \u201ca\nthing and its intention do not differ numerically with respect to\nanything absolute\u201d; they are the same thing strictly speaking.\nWhat thing and intention differ by is a respect or a relation. And\nthis is no ordinary respect \u201cfixed to or superimposed upon that\nthing, as are other relations, rather it is utterly intrinsic and\nindistinguishably joined to it.\u201d This intrinsic relation, Auriol\ntells us, is the appearance of the thing as an object of perception\n(apparere) to a perceiver (hence the term esse\napparens). For Auriol, then, it is intrinsic to each and every\nthing to have two different types of being: real or extra-mental being\non the one hand, and intentional or objective being on the other.\nUnlike real being, the thing\u2019s intentional being needs a\nperceiver in order to actualize it. This is only to say that it is\nthrough the act of conceiving that a thing is put into intentional\nbeing.\n\nIn fact \u2014 and here we return to conceptualism \u2014 on the\nbasis of what Auriol has said, we can deduce that every particular\nthing, e.g. Socrates, has several potential intentional existences:\none for each of Socrates\u2019 rationes, those basic units\nof intellectual acquaintance that direct the mind to form certain\nconcepts of him. And, according to Auriol, all of these different\nconcepts of Socrates are Socrates. On Auriol\u2019s account,\nthis makes good sense: rationes are quidditative or essential\naspects without which a particular thing would not be the particular\nthing that it in fact is. Thus, Socrates is not Socrates without being\na rational animal, i.e. without having the rationes\nsensitivity and rationality. Socrates is every bit as much a human\nbeing as he is Socrates, and on Auriol\u2019s theory the concept\n\u2018human being\u2019 is every bit as much Socrates as is the\nconcept \u2018Socrates\u2019. Thus upon intellectual acquaintance,\nSocrates (and in particular his ratio of rationality) directs\nus to form the concept \u2018human being\u2019, and that concept\nis Socrates, one of Socrates\u2019 several potential\nintentional existences.\n\nIn this way Auriol attempts to deal with the problems he saw in other\ntheories of concepts. On the one hand, he attempts to get our\nknowledge grounded as firmly as possible on extra-mental things: a\nconcept simply is the intellected extra-mental particular in\na different type of being from that which it has extra-mentally, a\ntype of being that is nevertheless intrinsic to the extra-mental\nparticular; the concept offers no barrier whatsoever between\nconceiving mind and conceived object. At the same time, however,\nAuriol wants to preserve the universality of universal concepts and\ntheir use in essential predications and necessary, scientific\nknowledge, and he thinks that his theory of concepts does just that.\nBecause rationes of the same kind found in different\nindividuals are \u201cmaximally similar,\u201d they all direct the\nmind to form the same concept. Thus the concept \u2018human\nbeing\u2019 arising from Socrates is the same as the concept\n\u2018human being\u2019 arising from Plato, since they are both\nbased on the maximally similar ratio of rationality. Auriol\nis clear that a universal concept is all of its particulars,\nrose is all particular roses, animal is all\nparticular animals. That is to say, animal is the concept and every\nreally existing animal at the same time.\n\nSensory Cognition (Wood 1982, pp. 214\u201317,\n220\u201323; Tachau 1988, pp. 89\u2013100; Denery 1998, pp.\n28\u201339; Li\u010dka 2016; Pickav\u00e9 2017; Bolyard 2021,\nsection 4.2.2): The intellect is not the only cognitive faculty that\nfunctions by putting the cognized thing into esse apparens:\nthe sensitive faculties also work in this way according to Auriol. In\nfact, Auriol uses sensory cognition, and his claim that the senses\nform esse apparens, as further proof that the intellect does\nso as well. In a famous passage in Auriol\u2019s works\n(Scriptum, d. 3, q. 3, a.1, ed. Buytaert, vol. 2, pp.\n696\u201399), one that was known to and criticized by William Ockham,\nAuriol creates an account of sensory cognition that takes its point of\ndeparture in a group of \u201cexperiences\u201d that Auriol thinks\nprove that the senses cognize by actively placing the object sensed in\nesse apparens. Thus, if someone were on a ship moving down a\nriver, it would appear to that person that the trees on the shore were\nmoving; when a baton is twirled extremely rapidly, it appears to the\nviewer that a colored circle hovers in the air; a stick placed halfway\ninto a bucket of water appears to be broken; if I press on my eye\nwhile looking at a candle, it will appear that I see two candles; upon\nlooking directly at the sun, an afterimage appears. Auriol gives eight\nexperiences like these, but for him all of them lead to the same\nconclusion: that in each of these cases, what appears to us\n(i.e. our erroneous perception) does not correspond directly to\nreality but is a result of the senses\u2019 putting the object into\nesse apparens. Take the case of the twirling baton: what is\nthe circle that appears in the air? It can\u2019t be anything real\nexisting in the baton itself, since the baton is straight. Nor,\nclearly, is the circle something real hovering in the air. Finally,\nthe circle is not something in vision or in the eye, since we are\nseeing the circle and not our vision of it, and also since the circle\nappears to be in the air. For Auriol, the only possible explanation\nfor the circle is that it appears to us because our sense of sight has\nactively put the baton into esse apparens. More generally,\nwhat we see in these cases is \u201conly the appearance of the thing\nor the thing in esse apparens.\u201d Sensory error, for\nAuriol, is explained by appealing to the fundamental activity of the\nsenses. And Auriol insists that the senses are just as active in cases\nwhere they function correctly; this is because, since activity is a\nnoble trait to have, if in erroneous visions our sense of sight\nactively places the thing seen in esse apparens, it will\ncertainly do so in veridical visions. The difference between a\nveridical sensory experience and an erroneous one is that in a\nveridical one the way the object of cognition appears and the\nway it is in extra-mental reality coincide. So in veridical\nsensory experience we have no way to tell that the senses are placing\nthe thing into esse apparens. Thus, these experiences of\nsensory error are of immense importance, since it is only through them\nthat we can discern the necessary role that esse apparens and\nthe activity of the senses play in all sensory cognition.\n\nFor Auriol, then, the senses necessarily put the cognized object into\nesse apparens or intentional being; this is a condition of\nour perceiving. Moreover, Auriol makes clear in this context that this\nesse apparens is not a representation of the thing with its\nown real being; rather it is the thing itself merely placed\nin another type of existence. The esse apparens of a sensed\nobject is merely that object as sensed. (See on this particularly\nDenery 1998, pp. 34\u201339.) Obviously, this corresponds to the\ntheory we have already seen Auriol holds concerning esse\napparens in intellectual cognition, and Auriol makes the\ncorrespondence explicit. To go from sensory perception to intellectual\ncognition, Auriol uses a common scholastic principle called by\nPhilotheus Boehner \u201cThe Principle of Hierarchy\u201d (Boehner\n1949, p. 298): given two faculties, one lower and one higher (like\nsense and intellect), if the lower faculty can do something noble,\nthen the higher faculty can certainly do the same. The activity of the\nsenses, then, i.e. the fact that the senses put the object into\nesse apparens, since it is noble, shows that the intellect\nalso puts its object into esse apparens. (Auriol\u2019s\ntheory of sensory perception is complicated by the fact that Auriol\nseems to claim that some of the illusory sensory experiences he\nmentions exist outside the mind, e.g., that the colored circle is\n\u201cin\u201d the air and not \u201cin\u201d the mind. For\napproaches to this complication, see Pasnau 1997, pp. 69\u201376;\nDenery 1998, pp. 36\u201337; Li\u010dka 2016).\n\nThree general claims can be made on the basis of this examination of\nAuriol\u2019s ideas on cognition and reality. First, Auriol is a\nconceptualist, holding that universals are nothing more than concepts\nformed by the mind, although these universal concepts do have a direct\nbasis in the particular thing cognized (the rationes).\nSecond, a principle underlying Auriol\u2019s theory of cognition is\nthat cognitive faculties are fundamentally active. All cognition takes\nplace because a cognitive faculty places the object of\ncognition into esse apparens, which is merely the object of\ncognition in a different type of being than it has extra-mentally, the\nbeing of being perceived. Thus, Auriol is part of one pronounced\nstrain of medieval thought (deriving from Augustine and ultimately\nfrom Plato) that rejects that the soul and its powers are passively\naffected by extra-mental objects. (See on this Tachau 1988, Friedman\n2000.) Cognitive powers are, for Auriol, active. A third point, and\none that has been noted in a great deal of the secondary literature\n(e.g., Tachau 1988; Denery 1998; Bolyard 2000; Friedman 2000) is that\nby appealing to erroneous visions to show that both sense and\nintellect produce esse apparens or make things appear, Auriol\nhas given error a central place in his account of cognition. To put\nthis in another way, Auriol does not have a real problem explaining\nhow we can have erroneous perception and intellection (in contrast to\nmany theories of knowledge); rather he needs to explain how we can\nhave veridical ones and just as importantly how we can know when we\nare having veridical ones. This is roughly one of the functions that\nthe distinction between intuitive and abstractive cognition served for\nsome medieval authors (in e.g., John Duns Scotus and William Ockham),\nalthough as we will see, Auriol does not use it in this way. Indeed it\nseems best to describe Auriol as a \u201creliabilist,\u201d holding\nas a type of axiomatic principle that under normal circumstances our\nGod-given cognitive faculties represent the world in an adequate\nmanner. (See Bolyard 2000, p. 175; that Auriol is not the only\nmedieval thinker with this reliabilist attitude, see e.g., Stump 1998,\npp. 306\u201307.) No matter what Auriol thought, however, the\nskeptical implications of Auriol\u2019s theory of esse\napparens did worry many of his medieval readers, and the theory\nelicited a critical response because some thought that it posed too\nsharp a break between cognition and reality.
