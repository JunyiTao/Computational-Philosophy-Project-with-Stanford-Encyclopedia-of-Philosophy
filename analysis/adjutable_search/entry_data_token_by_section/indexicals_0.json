The items on this list\ncome mostly from David Kaplan\u2019s influential work on indexicals,\nDemonstratives (Kaplan 1989a).\n\n\nIndexicals are commonly called context-sensitive\nexpressions (or context-dependent expressions) but the\ntwo terms tend to be used differently. The term \u2018indexical\u2019\ntends to be restricted to simple expressions, such as \u2018I\u2019\nand \u2018today\u2019. The term \u2018context-sensitive\u2019,\nhowever, is commonly applied both to simple indexicals and to complex\nexpressions that contain simple indexicals, for example, the definite\ndescription \u2018the dog she is looking at\u2019, the verb phrase\n\u2018sat next to me\u2019, and the sentence \u2018He is\nstanding\u2019.\n\n\nThe rough characterization of indexicals in the first sentence of\nthis article might be rejected by some theorists, for it relies on the\nnotion of a linguistic expression (such as \u2018you\u2019)\nvarying in reference, and content, among contexts. But some\ntheorists instead describe indexicality in terms of expressions varying\nin reference or content relative to utterances or other sorts\nof speech acts, such as assertions. Other theorists speak of\nutterances or tokens varying in reference or content,\nwithout any relativization to context or speech act. Some theorists\nspeak several ways. The differences may be theoretically significant,\nand more will be said about them below. In addition, some philosophers\nwould prefer to speak entirely about shifts in extension, rather than\nshifts in reference, from context to context. Some theorists, for\ninstance, hold that \u2018you\u2019 is not a singular term that\nrefers to an individual in a context. Rather, it is a quantifier\nphrase, and so its extension, in a context, is not an individual, but\nrather a certain sort of set. (See section 5.2 below for an analogous\nview of complex demonstratives.) Such a theorist may also wish to use\nthe term \u2018reference\u2019 only for expressions whose extensions\nare individuals. This article, however, will use\n\u2018reference\u2019 and \u2018extension\u2019 more-or-less\ninterchangeably. On this use of \u2018reference\u2019, the word\n\u2018you\u2019 varies in reference from context to context, even if\nit is a quantifier phrase whose extension, in a context, is not an\nindividual, but a set.\n\n\nIndexicality should be distinguished from ambiguity.\nAmbiguous simple expressions, such as \u2018bank\u2019 and\n\u2018bat\u2019, have a fixed, limited number of different meanings\ndetermined by linguistic convention. Indexicals, by contrast, seem to\nhave a single linguistic meaning that is fixed by linguistic\nconvention, but also another sort of meaning (content) that varies from\noccasion to occasion, or context to context. For instance, it seems that\n\u2018you\u2019 has a single meaning fixed by linguistic convention,\nand it is because of this fixed linguistic meaning that the sentence\n\u2018You are hungry\u2019 can have a virtually unlimited number of\ncontents, in different contexts.\n",
