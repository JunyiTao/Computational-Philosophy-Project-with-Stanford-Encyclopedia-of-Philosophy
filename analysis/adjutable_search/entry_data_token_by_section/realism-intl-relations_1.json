    "main_text": "The Roots of the Realist Tradition || Machiavelli\u2019s Critique of the Moral Tradition\n1.2 Machiavelli\u2019s Critique of the Moral Tradition\n\nIdealism in international relations, like realism, can lay claim to a\nlong tradition. Unsatisfied with the world as they have found it,\nidealists have always tried to answer the question of \u201cwhat\nought to be\u201d in politics. Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero were all\npolitical idealists who believed that there were some universal moral\nvalues on which political life could be based. Building on the work of\nhis predecessors, Cicero developed the idea of a natural moral law\nthat was applicable to both domestic and international politics. His\nideas concerning righteousness in war were carried further in the\nwritings of the Christian thinkers St. Augustine and St. Thomas\nAquinas. In the late fifteenth century, when Niccol\u00f2\nMachiavelli was born, the idea that politics, including the relations\namong states, should be virtuous, and that the methods of warfare\nshould remain subordinated to ethical standards, still predominated in\npolitical literature.\n\nMachiavelli (1469\u20131527) challenged this well-established moral\ntradition, thus positioning himself as a political innovator. The\nnovelty of his approach lies in his critique of classical Western\npolitical thought as unrealistic, aiming too high, and in his\nseparation of politics from ethics. He thereby lays the foundations\nfor modern politics focussed on self-interest. In chapter XV of\nThe Prince, Machiavelli announces that in departing from the\nteachings of earlier thinkers, he seeks \u201cthe effectual truth of\nthe matter rather than the imagined one.\u201d The \u201ceffectual\ntruth\u201d is for him the only truth worth seeking. It represents\nthe sum of the practical conditions that he believes are required to\nmake both the individual and the country prosperous and strong.\nMachiavelli replaces the ancient virtue (a moral quality of\nthe individual, such as justice or self-restraint) with\nvirt\u00f9, ability or vigor. As a prophet of\nvirt\u00f9, he promises to lead both nations and\nindividuals to earthly glory and power.\n\nMachiavellianism is a radical type of political realism that\nis applied to both domestic and international affairs. It is sometimes\ncalled realpolitik, and is a doctrine which denies the\nrelevance of ethics in politics, and claims that all means (moral and\nimmoral) are justified to achieve certain political ends. Although\nMachiavelli never uses the phrase ragione di stato or its\nFrench equivalent, raison d\u2019\u00e9tat, what\nultimately counts for him is precisely that: whatever is good for the\nstate, rather than ethical scruples or norms\n\nMachiavelli justified immoral actions in politics, but never refused\nto admit that they are evil. He operated within the single framework\nof traditional morality. It became a specific task of his\nnineteenth-century followers to develop the doctrine of a double\nethics: one public and one private, to push Machiavellian realism to\neven further extremes, and to apply it to international relations. By\nasserting that \u201cthe state has no higher duty than of maintaining\nitself,\u201d Hegel gave an ethical sanction to the state\u2019s\npromotion of its own interest and advantage against other states\n(Meinecke 357). Thus he overturned the traditional beliefs about\nmorality. The good of the state was perversely interpreted by him as\nthe highest moral value, with the extension of national power regarded\nas a nation\u2019s right and duty. Then, referring to Machiavelli,\nHeinrich von Treitschke declared that the state was power, precisely\nin order to assert itself as against other equally independent powers,\nand that the supreme moral duty of the state was to foster this power.\nHe considered international agreements to be binding only insofar as\nit was expedient for the state. The idea of an autonomous ethics of\nstate behavior and the concept of realpolitik were thus\nintroduced. Traditional, customary ethics was denied and power\npolitics was associated with a \u201chigher\u201d type of morality.\nThese concepts, along with the belief in the superiority of Germanic\nculture, served as weapons with which German statesmen, from the\neighteenth century to the end of the Second World War, justified their\npolicies of conquest and extermination.\n\nMachiavelli is often praised for his prudential advice to leaders\n(which has caused him to be regarded as a founding master of modern\npolitical strategy) and for his defense of the republican form of\ngovernment. There are certainly many aspects of his thought that merit\nsuch praise. Nevertheless, it is also possible to see him as the\nthinker who bears foremost responsibility for the de-moralization of\nEurope. The argument of the Athenian envoys presented in\nThucydides\u2019 \u201cMelian Dialogue,\u201d that of Thrasymachus\nin Plato\u2019s Republic, or that of Carneades, to whom\nCicero refers\u2014all of these challenge the ancient and Christian\nviews of the unity of politics and ethics. However, before\nMachiavelli, this amoral or immoral mode of thinking had never\nprevailed in the mainstream of Western political thought. It was the\nforce and timeliness of his justification of resorting to evil as a\nlegitimate means of achieving political ends that persuaded so many of\nthe thinkers and political practitioners who followed him. The effects\nof Machiavellian ideas, such as the notion that the employment of all\npossible means was permissible in war, would be seen on the\nbattlefields of modern Europe, as mass citizen armies fought against\neach other to the bitter end without regard for the rules of justice.\nThe tension between expediency and morality lost its validity in the\nsphere of politics. The concept of a double ethics that created a\nfurther damage to traditional morality, was invented. The doctrine of\nraison d\u2019\u00e9tat ultimately led to the politics of\nLebensraum, two world wars, and the Holocaust.\n\nPerhaps the greatest problem with realism in international relations\nis that it has a tendency to slip into its extreme version, which\naccepts any policy that can benefit the state at the expense of other\nstates, no matter how morally problematic the policy is. Even if they\ndo not explicitly raise ethical questions, in the works of Waltz and\nof many other of today\u2019s neorealists, a double ethics, public\nand private, is presupposed, and words such realpolitik no\nlonger have the negative connotations that they had for classical\nrealists, such as Hans Morgenthau.\n",
