    "main_text": "Feminist Reconstructions of Transcendence || A Process Feminist Proposal\n4.1 A Process Feminist Proposal\n\nOn the question of the meaning and reference of God-talk, two\ncontemporary schools of philosophy of religion stand out as apparent\nresources for feminist reconstruction. Both (1) the tradition that\nemploys the classical ontology of being, extending from Thomas Aquinas\nto Paul Tillich and the early Mary Daly, and (2) the tradition that\nemploys an ontology of becoming, extending from Alfred North Whitehead\nto Charles Hartshorne, John Cobb, Jr., David Griffin, Marjorie\nSuchocki, and Catherine Keller, afford systematic conceptual schemes\nfor explicating the metaphors that appear in various contemporary\nwritings concerning \u201cthe divine\u201d and any of its variants,\nsuch as \u201cthe sacred\u201d, \u201cspirit\u201d,\n\u201cGod\u201d, \u201ctranscendence\u201d, or \u201chigher\npower\u201d. Both traditions can be modified, moreover, according to\nqualifications suggested in this section. They can then be understood\nas converging in a single conceptual model, rendered as\n\u201ccreativity\u201d in Whitehead\u2019s system and as\n\u201cbeing\u201d (esse) in Aquinas\u2019s. This model can be\nseen as a coherent way of reconciling the Whiteheadian and the\nThomistic accounts, while also providing a conceptual alternative to\nanthropomorphic images of God as Loving Father, Cosmic Monarch,\nCreator and Intervener, and so forth.\n\nThe school of thought known as process philosophy rewrites philosophy\nof religion in a radically revisionist mode that accents evolution,\norganismic connectedness, and the primacy of becoming. Its theism is\ntermed \u201cpanentheism\u201d, or all-in-god. Process philosophers\nof religion were preeminent among those who labored in the twentieth\ncentury to construct a coherent philosophy of God that would also be\nconsistent with scientific cosmology and evolutionary theory. They\nproduced, in addition, a model relatively free of sexism and\nandrocentrism. The underlying values of the process worldview are\norganic, relational, dynamic, and embodied. Whitehead\u2019s elaboration of\nthe idea that \u201cit is as true to say that God creates the World,\nas that the World creates God\u201d (1929 [1978: 348]) anticipated\nthe themes of interrelatedness and mutual conditioning that feminist\nphilosophy has developed in multiple ways in recent decades.\n\nIn the process paradigm everything comes into being by grasping or\n\u201cprehending\u201d antecedently actualized things to integrate\nthem into a new actualized thing, its own self. Supplanting substance\nphilosophy\u2019s idea that it takes an agent to act, process philosophy\nproposes a model whereby agents are the results of acts and subjects\nare constituted out of relations. Throughout the entire universe, at\nboth macrocosmic and microcosmic levels, quantum units of becoming\nachieve momentary unity out of a given multiplicity in a never-ending\nrhythm of creative process whereby \u201cthe many become one and are\nincreased by one\u201d (1929 [1978: 21]).\n\nCreativity within each occasion is spontaneous, the mark of actuality,\nand free, within the limits determined by its antecedent causes.\nCreativity unifies any many and is creative of a new unifying\nperspective which then becomes one among the many. In a process\nontology, creativity is ultimate reality not in the sense of something\nmore ultimate behind, above, or beyond reality, but in the sense of\nsomething ultimately descriptive of all reality, or what the biologist\nCharles Birch and the theologian John B. Cobb, Jr. have called\n\u201cthe Life Process\u201d (1982). As a category, creativity is the \u201cultimate of\nultimates\u201d in Whitehead\u2019s words, but as such it is an\nabstraction, the formal character of any actual occasion. Creativity\nas concrete, however, signifies a dynamism which is the very actuality\nof things, their act of being there at all. Everything exists in\nvirtue of creativity, but creativity is not any thing,\naccording to process feminist philosophers of religion.\n\nThe idea that the category of the divine or transcendence can be\ncorrelated with the category of creativity in Whitehead\u2019s philosophy\nmarks a departure from Whitehead\u2019s own notion of God as an actual\nentity in process of becoming at the same time that it joins with the\nThomistic tradition that has employed the language of being, rather\nthan becoming, to explicate the meaning of the divine. In its\nclassical medieval synthesis in Aquinas, this tradition conceptualized\nthe divine as esse ipsum, and held that in God essence and\nexistence are one; that is, God\u2019s very nature is esse, to be.\nEverything that exists was thought to do so through participation in\ndivine being, or being itself. For Aquinas and classical thinkers,\nbeing was already concretized in a single source that was supremely\nactual. It is this crucial assumption, Frankenberry has argued, that\nundergoes modification in the shift from a substance metaphysics to\none in which processive-relational categories are taken as ultimate\n(1993). The result is radical. De-substantialized and freed from\nstatic fixity in neo-scholastic metaphysics, being signifies the\nsource and power of all that exists. Dynamized and pluralized\naccording to the process paradigm, being does not repose in an\noriginary source antecedent to every event; rather, it constitutes the\nvery act of be-ing, of liv-ing, of ex-isting in the present moment as\na new one emergent from an antecedent many. As such, being or\ncreativity is inherently relational and processive. It is immanent\nwithin each momentary event as its spontaneous power; and it is also\ntranscendent to that event of becoming in the sense that it is never\nexhausted by the forms in which it is found, but is always potentially\na \u201cmore\u201d that is \u201cnot yet\u201d actualized. As long\nas being, like creativity, is not construed as something a being\nhas but rather as what it means to be at all, the\nlong identification of God with being in Western thought can be\nunderstood to point to sheer livingness or that which energizes all\nthings to exist. Although no-thing particular in its own right, being\nis the very actuality of things, their act of being there at all.\nNevertheless, Being-itself should not be construed as a particular\nbeing, thus ruling out pictorial theism\u2019s anthropomorphism. Neither is\nit the sum of all beings, thus ruling out simple aggregation or\ntotality. It is not a property of things nor an accidental quality,\nnot a substance, and not a class of things. Instead, the religious\nsymbol \u201cGod\u201d can be understood to pertain to the creative\nground of all that is\u2014that which energizes all\nthings\u2014conceived as dynamic, immanent, and plural.\n\nThe philosophical concepts of creativity (as explicated by Whitehead)\nand of esse (as explicated dynamically) are useful for any\nfeminist philosophy of religion that seeks to interpret the meaning of\n\u201cdivine reality\u201d, \u201choly mystery\u201d,\n\u201cempowering spirit\u201d, and a variety of other metaphors and\nsymbols that abound in feminist theology. The concept of God as\nesse refers to the utter actuality of things, an act common\nto all things. Dynamic and living, be-ing is yet elusive. It signifies\nthe moment to moment reality in virtue of which everything exists, a\nprocess that Whitehead\u2019s category of creativity describes as the many\nbecoming one, and as increased by one. Be-ing is no more real or\nunitary than beings, just as creativity in process philosophy is only\nactual in virtue of its accidents. As a model for feminist work, this\nnotion of transcendence is dialectically related to immanence, neither\ndissolved into it as identical, nor divorced from it as wholly\nother.\n",
