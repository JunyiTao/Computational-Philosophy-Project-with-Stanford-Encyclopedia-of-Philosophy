One of the main\nactivities of Senghor when he first arrived in Paris at the end of the\n1920s was to visit the ethnographical museum at Place Trocad\u00e9ro\nin Paris. By then the vogue of art n\u00e8gre (black art)\nhad already produced its effects on modern European art. Pablo\nPicasso, in particular, in 1906 had made the turn of making African\nsculptures and masks part of his artistic pursuit: his Demoiselles\nd\u2019Avignon, painted in 1906, manifested that move. The\n1930s, the years when Senghor, C\u00e9saire and Damas started\nwriting, is the time when what was labeled \u201cprimitive\nobjects\u201d were now more widely perceived as art, beyond the\ncircles of the artistic avant-garde. The Universal Exposition in Paris\nin 1931 showed that new\n \u201csensibility\u201d.[10]\n\nSenghor wanted N\u00e9gritude to be the philosophy of the\ngeometrical forms so characteristic of African masks and sculptures\nacross different regions and cultures. He would often explain that the\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre of art in Africa is not to reproduce or\nembellish reality but to establish the connection with what he labeled\nthe sub-reality that is the universe of vital forces. What\nmodern art understood from the consideration of art\nn\u00e8gre is that the issue was not anymore to simply\nreproduce sensible appearances but to deal with the forces hidden\nbeneath the surface of things. That is why the African objects at the\nTrocad\u00e9ro museum were at once religious and artistic\nartifacts.\n\nPlastic forms are life forces, they are rhythms. So objects such as\nmasks or sculptures are to be read as combinations of rhythms as we\ncan see in the following aesthetic analysis by Senghor of a feminine\nstatuette from Baule culture (in today Ivory Coast): \u201cIn it, two\nthemes of sweetness sing an alternating song. The breasts are ripe\nfruits. The chin and the knees, the rump and the calves are also\nfruits or breasts. The neck, the arms and the thighs are columns of\nblack\n honey.\u201d[11]\n This reading establishes the object as a composition of two rhythmic\nseries (what is referred to here, poetically, as two themes of\nsweetness): the concave forms of the breasts, chin, knees, rump and\ncalves, on the one hand; on the other hand, the cylindrical forms that\nare the neck, the arms and the thighs. This example indicates what\nSenghor understands by \u201crhythm\u201d and illustrates what he\nsees as its omnipresence in Black aesthetic products, as he certainly\nremembers here the notion expressed, ten years before by Jane Nardal,\nof a \u201crule of rhythm, the sovereign master of [black]\nbodies\u201d (Nardal, 2002, 105). In his first essay on\nN\u00e9gritude, \u201cWhat the Black Man Contributes\u201d,\nSenghor wrote:\n\nThis ordering force that constitutes Negro style is rhythm.\nIt is the most sensible and the least material thing. It is the vital\nelement par excellence. It is the primary condition for, and sign of,\nart, as respiration is of life \u2013 respiration that rushes or\nslows down, becomes regular or spasmodic, depending on the\nbeing\u2019s tension, the degree and quality of the emotion. Such is\nrhythm, originally, in its purity, such is it in the masterpieces of\nNegro art, particularly in sculpture. It is composed of one theme\n\u2013 sculptural form \u2013 that is opposed to a brother theme,\nlike inhalation is opposed to exhalation, and that is reprised. It is\nnot a symmetry that engenders monotony; rhythm is alive, it is free.\nFor reprise is not redundancy, or repetition. The theme is reprised at\nanother place, on another level, in another combination, in a\nvariation. And it produces something like another tone, another\ntimbre, another accent. And the general effect is intensified by this,\nnot without nuances. This is how rhythm acts, despotically, on what is\nleast intellectual in us, to make us enter into the spirituality of\nthe object; and this attitude of abandon that we have is itself\nrhythmic. (Senghor 1964, 296)\n\n\nSeventeen years later he would reiterate the same credo:\n\nWhat is rhythm? It is the architecture of being, the internal\ndynamism that gives it form, the system of waves it emanates toward\nthe Others, the pure expression of vital force. Rhythm is the\nvibrating shock, the force that, through the senses, seizes us at the\nroot of being. It expresses itself through the most material\nand sensual means: lines, surfaces, colors, and volumes in\narchitecture, sculpture and painting; accents in poetry and music;\nmovements in dance. But, in doing so, it organizes all this\nconcreteness toward the light of the Spirit. For the Negro\nAfrican, it is insofar as it is incarnate in sensuality that rhythm\nilluminates the\n Spirit.[12]\n\n\nIn 1966, L.S. Senghor, then the President of Senegal since the country\nbecame independent in 1960, organized in Dakar an international event\nthat he obviously intended to be a great moment of celebration of what\nhe had been pursuing his whole life: the World Festival of Black Arts,\nmeant to be the concrete manifestation of black aesthetics in all its\ndimensions. Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, one of the most celebrated\nguests of honor at the Festival, was invited to give a \u201cLecture\non African Art\u201d (\u201cDiscours sur l\u2019art\n africain\u201d).[13]\n He first insisted on the question of the role and significance of art\nin general in the modern world, quoting the poet Saint-John Perse:\n\u201cWhen mythology falls apart, it is in poetry that the divine\nfinds refuge \u2026 it is from poetic imagination that the fierce\npassion of people seeking light gets its flame\u201d\n(Th\u00e9bia-Melsan 2000, 22). What N\u00e9gritude poets did even\nif he does not like the word N\u00e9gritude at all, declares\nC\u00e9saire, and in spite of their failings, was just that: to be\nlight bearers for Africa. Then he proceeded to ask whether African art\nof the past will be a catalyst for African art in the present and the\nfuture the way it had been for European art at the beginning of the\ntwentieth century. That was a way for him of calling the attention on\nthe questions at the core of his thinking about aesthetics (but also\npolitics): how to regain initiative? How to avoid the lack of\nauthenticity of sheer imitation or mimesis: mimesis of Europe\nas well as mimesis of one\u2019s own artistic tradition.\n\nAs to his philosophy of art as such, C\u00e9saire\u2019s views\nfollow consistently from his surrealist poetics and eventually\nconverge with his friend Senghor\u2019s. C\u00e9saire\u2019s\nnotion of the primordial role that should be played by the\nDionysian in art versus the Apollonian. These are\ncategories that C\u00e9saire and Senghor adopted from\nNietzsche\u2019s philosophy (Nietzsche\u2019s Birth of\nTragedy) to express the opposition between the primal, obscure\nforce of life considered as an organic whole (the Dionysian) on the\none hand, and on the other hand the plastic beauty or the form which\nbrings into light the individuality of the object (the Apollonian):\nthe Dionysian speaks to our emotion while the Apollonian speaks to our\nintellectuality. C\u00e9saire evokes such a contrast when he states\nthat: \u201cThe poetically beautiful is not merely beauty of\nexpression or muscular euphoria. A too Apollonian or gymnastic idea of\nbeauty paradoxically runs the risk of skinning, stuffing, and\nhardening it.\u201d This is the seventh and final thesis of the\npropositions summarizing his views about Poetry and\n Knowledge[14]\n and it is in perfect resonance with Senghor\u2019s view of African\nart as the language of the ontology of vital forces.\n\nIn conclusion, N\u00e9gritude as aesthetics is predicated on such\noppositions as those between sub-reality (or sur-reality) and\nappearance, force and form, emotion and intellect, Dionysian and\nApollonian. C\u00e9saire, Damas (as shown in the preface of his\nanthology) and Senghor all agreed that art was a vital\nresponse to the mechanistic and de-humanizing philosophy that produced\n(and was produced by) modern Europe. And like Nietzsche, they believed\nthat art was another approach by which a sense of the world as\ntotality would be restored. These lines from C\u00e9saire\u2019s\n\u201cDiscourse on African Art\u201d delivered in Dakar on April 6,\n1966, at the opening of the \u201cWorld Festival of Negro Arts\u201d\nsummarize N\u00e9gritude philosophy of the significance of art,\nespecially black art: \u201cThrough art, the reified world becomes\nagain the human world, the world of living realities, the world of\ncommunication and participation. From a collection of things, poetry\nand art remake the world, a world which is whole, which is total and\nharmonious. And that is why poetry is youth. It is the force that\ngives back to the world its prime vitality, which gives back to\neverything its aura of marvelous by replacing it within the original\ntotality\u201d (Th\u00e9bia-Melsan, 2000, 21).\n\nAnd it can be argued that it is because of that significance of art\nthat N\u00e9gritude also presented itself as another type of\nknowledge or epistemology and as another politics.\n",
