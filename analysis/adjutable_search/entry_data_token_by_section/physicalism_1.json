The first\nsentence of\n Friedrich Lange\u2019s\n The History of Materialism, which was the standard work on the\nsubject in the 19th century is: \u201cMaterialism is as old as philosophy,\nbut not older\u201d (1925, 3). What Lange has in mind is the pre-Socratic\nphilosopher\n Democritus,\n who is usually thought of defending a kind of physicalism or\nmaterialism when he said or allegedly said, \u201call is atoms and the\nvoid.\u201d This view casts a long shadow over subsequent formulations of\nphysicalism. A position like that of Democritus was revived in the\nearly modern period just prior to Newton, by philosophers and\nscientists such as\n Hobbes\n or\n Gassendi.\n In the eighteenth century, French philosophers like\n D\u2019Holbach\n and La Mettrie thought of themselves as materialists (and would be\nnow classified as physicalists) somewhat in the same way since they\nheld that each human being is a complicated sort of machine. In the\nnineteenth century, while\n Karl Marx\u2019s\n \u2018dialectical materialism\u2019 is something different from the\nmetaphysical thesis we will focus on, he nevertheless developed his\nsocial philosophy against the background of what we would call\nphysicalism; in fact, Marx\u2019s doctoral dissertation was a comparison of\nDemocritus and\n Epicurus.  And in the twentieth century,\n analytic philosophers such as Smart and Lewis self-consciously\n defended their views in a way that acknowledges, as Lewis put it,\n \u201cour intellectual ancestors\u201d (1994, 293).\n\nHowever, while there is certainly something in common here, the\nunderlying historical issues are extremely complicated, since they\ninvolve subtle questions of scientific and philosophical change. We\nwon\u2019t discuss them in detail in this entry. It is worth emphasis,\nthough, that we should be careful in lumping different people in\ndifferent epochs together. The precise views they held are often\ndifferent from one another. As we noted above, and as Lange himself\nemphasises, Newton did not think that, even in the physical world, all\nis atoms and the void, since for him there are also forces such as\ngravity. It follows that any post-Newtonian philosophers who think of\nthemselves as physicalists must have a different thesis in mind from\nDemocritus.\n",
