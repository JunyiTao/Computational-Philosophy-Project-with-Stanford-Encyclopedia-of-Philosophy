    "main_text": "Intuition and Expression || The Role of Feeling\n4.2 The Role of Feeling\n\nFeeling, for Croce, is necessarily part of any (mental)\nactivity, including bare perception\u2014indeed, feeling is\na form of mental activity (it is part of his philosophy that there is\nnever literally present to consciousness anything passive). We are\naccustomed to thinking of \u2018artistic expression\u2019 as\nconcerned with specific emotions that are relatively rare in the\nmental life, but again, Croce points out that strictly speaking, we\nare thinking of a quantitative distinction as qualitative. In fact\nfeeling is nothing but the will in mental activity, with all its\nvarieties of thought, desire and action, its varieties of frustration\nand satisfaction (Aes. 74\u20136). The only criterion of\n\u2018art\u2019 is coherence of expression, of the movement of the\nwill (for a comparison with Collingwood\u2019s similar doctrine, see\nKemp 2003: 173\u20139).\n\nBecause of this, Croce discounts certain aesthetic applications of the\ndistinction between form and content as confused. The distinction only\napplies at a theoretical level, to a posited a priori\nsynthesis (EA 39\u201340). At that level, the irruption of\nan intuition just is the emergence of a form (we are right to\nspeak of the formation of intuition, that intuitions are\nformed). At the aesthetic level\u2014one might say at the\nphenomenological level\u2014there is no identification of content\nindependently of the forms in which we meet it, and none of form\nindependently of content. It makes no sense to speak of a work of\nart\u2019s being good on form but poor on content, or good on content\nbut poor on form.\n",
