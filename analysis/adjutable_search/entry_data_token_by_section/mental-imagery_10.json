    "main_text": "Mental imagery in perception || Pain mental imagery\n2.4 Pain mental imagery\n\nPerhaps the most useful application of multimodal mental imagery\ninvolves pain management. More specifically, one of the most efficient\nways of alleviating (chronic) pain is by means of the use of mental\nimagery in other sense modalities (Fardo et al. 2015, MacIver et al.\n2008 and Volz et al. 2015). This presents something of a conundrum:\nwhy does mental imagery in, say, the visual sense modality help us\nwith pain?\n\nPain perception, in textbook cases, starts with the stimulation of\npain receptors, known as nociceptors, and this input is then processed\nin the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. But sometimes\npain processing in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices is\nnot directly triggered by nociceptors. This would be the equivalent of\nmental imagery in the context of pain perception \u2013 something we\ncould call pain imagery.\n\nThe question is then about the relation between pain perception and\npain imagery: between processing in the primary and secondary\nsomatosensory cortices that is directly triggered by nociceptors and\nprocessing that is not. And the claim that would be structurally\nsimilar to the Kantian claim we considered in Section 2.1 and Section\n2.2 is that just as visual mental imagery is a crucial ingredient of\nvision and multimodal mental imagery is a crucial ingredient of\nperception, pain mental imagery (representation formed as a result of\nperceptual processing in the primary and secondary somatosensory\ncortices that is not triggered directly by nociception) is a crucial\ningredient of pain perception (in fact, it may even be partly\nconstitutive of it, see Nanay 2017b).\n\nIn some instances of pain perception, mental imagery plays an even\nmore central role: for example, phantom limb pain (pain some subjects\nfeel in amputated limbs) consists of cortical pain processing (in\nS1/S2) that is not triggered by nociceptors (Ramachandran et al. 1995)\nfor the simple reasons that the relevant nociceptors are missing (they\nhave been cut off with the rest of the limb). Further, the thermal\ngrill illusion (where applying warmth to the index and the ring finger\nand cold to the middle finger triggers strong pain sensation in the\nmiddle finger) is also an instance of sensory pain processing that is\nnot triggered by nociception (Defrin et al. 2002). In both cases, as\nthe nociception is missing, there is no pain perception, but only pain\nimagery.\n\nThere may be reasons to generalize the importance of pain mental\nimagery in pain perception. One important feature of pain perception\nis that it is extremely dependent on expectations (when you expect\npainful sensation, a non-painful stimulus can lead to pain sensation,\nsee Sawamoto et al. 2000; Keltner et al. 2006; Ploghaus et al. 1999).\nIf we consider at least some forms of expectations to be\n(future-oriented) temporal mental imagery (see Section 5.2 for more on\nexpectations and mental imagery), then these results are easily\nexplained.\n",
