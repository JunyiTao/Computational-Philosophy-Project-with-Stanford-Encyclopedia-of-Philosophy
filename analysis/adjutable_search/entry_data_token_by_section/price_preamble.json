    "main_text": "\n\nHenry Habberley Price, who published as H. H. Price, was born in 1899.\nFrom 1935 to 1959 he was Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford\nUniversity. Price was a major figure in his lifetime well-known\nespecially for the \u201cclarity and elegance of style\u201d, which,\naccording to Martha Kneale (1996: xix), make his works readable in\nspite of changing fashions in philosophy. Many people\u2019s\nacquaintance nowadays with Price\u2019s philosophical work derives\nfrom his being a target in Austin\u2019s (1962) famous attack on the\nsense-datum theory. This restricted acquaintance with his output is\none reason that Price has been ignored in recent philosophy.\n\nMainstream philosophy neglected him after the Second World War,\nperhaps partly because, when articulating his ideas, he mainly engaged\nwith philosophers of the past, such as Locke and Hume. His thought\nwas, however, valued by fellow philosophers such as Broad, Moore,\nAyer, and generations of his students at Oxford, including Sellars,\nArmstrong, and Anscombe.\n\nAlthough Price is seen mainly as a philosopher of perception, only two\nof his six books are about perception and he had a major influence,\nalso publishing many articles, on a variety of topics, including some\nwe cannot focus on here, e.g., our evidence of other minds (1938;\n1930b: 195) and psychical research (1940c; 1953b; 1972; 1995; an\ninterest he claims to share with Neo-Platonists [1968a: 447]). We can\nonly provide a sketch of his rich contributions. After briefly\nsketching his life (\u00a71), we discuss his philosophy\u2019s\ngeneral features (\u00a72), contributions to the studies of perception\n(\u00a73), properties (\u00a75.1), recognition (\u00a75), belief\n(\u00a76), religious belief (\u00a76.8), his revival and serious study\nof Hume (\u00a74), and some remarkable anticipations (\u00a77).\n",
