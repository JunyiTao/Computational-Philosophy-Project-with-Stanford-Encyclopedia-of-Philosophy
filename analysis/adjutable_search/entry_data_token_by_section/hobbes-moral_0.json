    "main_text": "Major Political Writings\n1. Major Political Writings\n\nHobbes wrote several versions of his political philosophy, including\nThe Elements of Law, Natural and Politic (also under the\ntitles Human Nature and De Corpore Politico)\npublished in 1650, De Cive (1642) published in English as\nPhilosophical Rudiments Concerning Government and Society in\n1651, the English Leviathan published in 1651, and its Latin\nrevision in 1668. Others of his works are also important in\nunderstanding his political philosophy, especially his history of the\nEnglish Civil War, Behemoth (published 1679), De\nCorpore (1655), De Homine (1658), Dialogue Between a\nPhilosopher and a Student of the Common Laws of England (1681),\nand The Questions Concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance\n(1656). All of Hobbes\u2019s major writings are collected in The\nEnglish Works of Thomas Hobbes, edited by Sir William Molesworth\n(11 volumes, London 1839\u201345), and Thomae Hobbes Opera\nPhilosophica Quae Latina Scripsit Omnia, also edited by\nMolesworth (5 volumes; London, 1839\u201345). Oxford University Press\nhas undertaken a projected 26 volume collection of the Clarendon\nEdition of the Works of Thomas Hobbes. So far 3 volumes are\navailable: De Cive (edited by Howard Warrender), The\nCorrespondence of Thomas Hobbes (edited by Noel Malcolm), and\nWritings on Common Law and Hereditary Right (edited by Alan\nCromartie and Quentin Skinner). Recently Noel Malcolm has published a\nthree volume edition of Leviathan, which places the English\ntext side by side with Hobbes\u2019s later Latin version of it.\nReaders new to Hobbes should begin with Leviathan, being sure\nto read Parts Three and Four, as well as the more familiar and often\nexcerpted Parts One and Two. There are many fine overviews of\nHobbes\u2019s normative philosophy, some of which are listed in the\nfollowing selected bibliography of secondary works.\n",
