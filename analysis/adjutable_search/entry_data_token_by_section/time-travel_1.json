    "main_text": "What is Time Travel? || Time Discrepancy\n1.1 Time Discrepancy\nOne objection to the possibility of time travel flows directly from\nattempts to define it in anything like Lewis\u2019s way. The worry is\nthat because time travel involves \u201ca discrepancy between time\nand time\u201d, time travel scenarios are simply incoherent. The time\ntraveller traverses thirty years in one year; she is 51 years old 21\nyears after her birth; she dies at the age of 90, 200 years before her\nbirth; and so on. The objection is that these are straightforward\ncontradictions: the basic description of what time travel involves is\ninconsistent; therefore time travel is logically\nimpossible.[9]\n\n\nThere must be something wrong with this objection, because it would\nshow Einstein to be logically impossible\u2014whereas this\nsort of future-directed time travel has actually been observed (albeit\non a much smaller scale\u2014but that does not affect the present\npoint) (Hafele and Keating, 1972b,a). The most common response to the\nobjection is that there is no contradiction because the interval of\ntime traversed by the time traveller and the duration of her journey\nare measured with respect to different frames of reference: there is\nthus no reason why they should coincide. A similar point applies to\nthe discrepancy between the time elapsed since the time\ntraveller\u2019s birth and her age upon arrival. There is no more of\na contradiction here than in the fact that Melbourne is both 800\nkilometres away from Sydney\u2014along the main highway\u2014and\n1200 kilometres away\u2014along the coast\nroad.[10]\n",
