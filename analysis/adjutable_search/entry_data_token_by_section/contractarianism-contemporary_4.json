    "main_text": "Modeling the Parties || Doxastic vs. Evaluative\n2.4 Doxastic vs. Evaluative \n\nAny representation of the reasoning of the parties will have two\nelements that need to be specified: 1) doxastic and 2) evaluative.\nThese elements, when combined, create a complete model that will\nspecify how and why representatives in the contractual model choose or\nagree to some set of social rules. The first (doxastic) is the\nspecification of everything the representatives in the original\nposition know or at least believe. Choice in the contractual model in\nthe broadest sense, is an attempt by the parties to choose a set of\nrules that they expect will be better than in some baseline condition,\nsuch as \u201cgeneralized egoism\u201d (Rawls, 1999: 127) a\n\u201cstate of nature\u201d (Hobbes 1651) or the rules that they\ncurrently have (Binmore, 2005; Buchanan 2000 [1975]). To do this, they\nneed representations of the baseline and of state of the world under\ncandidate set of rules). Without either of these doxastic\nrepresentations, the choice problem would be indeterminate. Rawls\nfamously imposes severe doxastic constraints on his parties to the\nsocial contract by imposing a thick veil of ignorance that eliminates\ninformation about the specific details of each individual and the\nworld they live in. James Buchanan imposes a similar, but less\nrestrictive \u201cveil of uncertainty\u201d on his representative\nchoosers (Buchanan and Tullock 1965 [1962]; Buchanan 1975; see also\nRawls, 1958).\n\nIn addition to specifying what the representatives believe to be the\ncase about the world and the results of their agreement, there must\nalso be some standard by which the representative parties can evaluate\ndifferent contractual possibilities. They must be able to rank the\noptions on the basis of their values, whatever those may be. Rawls\nmodels parties to the contractual situation as, at least initially,\nhaving only one metric of value: primary goods. They choose the\nconception of justice they do insofar as they believe it will likely\ngenerate the most primary goods for them and their descendants. This\nspecification of the evaluative parameter is uniform across choosers\nand therefore, choice in the original position can be modeled as the\nchoice of one individual. Insofar as there is evaluative diversity\nbetween the representatives, more complex models of agreement will be\nneeded (see \u00a73). If we think in terms of decision theory, the\ndoxastic specification individuates the initial state of affairs and\nthe outcomes of the contractual model, while the specification of the\nevaluative elements gives each representative party a ranking of the\noutcomes expected to result from the choice of any given set of rules.\nOnce these elements are specified, we have a model of the parties to\nthe contract.\n",
