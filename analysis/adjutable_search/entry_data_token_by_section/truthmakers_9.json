    "main_text": "Which range of truths are eligible to be made true (if any are)? || Truth Supervenes Upon Being\n2.3 Truth Supervenes Upon Being\n\nOptimalism retains the original demand for truth-makers but restricts\nit to atomic statements. Optimalism accordingly disavows a commitment\nto truth-makers for negative statements and statements of generality.\nBut Bigelow\u23afalso wary of the commitments that maximalism\nengenders to negative and totality facts\u23af weakens what\ntruth-making means to a point where negative and general statements\ndon\u2019t require bespoke truth-makers of their own (1988:\n131\u20133). He offers the following principle to capture the kernel\nof truth in truth-making worth saving.\n\n(Truth Supervenes on Being) \nIf something is true then it would not be possible for it to be\nfalse unless either certain things were to exist which don\u2019t, or\nelse certain things had not existed which do (1988: 133).\n\n\nThis principle allows atomic truths to have truth-makers\u23afbecause\nit would only be possible for them to be false if certain things had\nnot existed: their truth-makers. But it also allows negative truths to\nbe true without them. The statement that there are no dragons gets to\nbe true because it would only be possible for that statement to be\nfalse if something which hadn\u2019t existed (dragons) did exist.\nSuch statements are true not because they have truth-makers but\nbecause they have no counterexamples, \u201cthey lack\nfalse-makers\u201d (Lewis 1992: 216, 2001: 610).\n\nGeneral truths are also true for lack of false-makers. The statement\nthat everything is physical (if true) is true because it would only be\npossible for the statement to be false if something that hadn\u2019t\nexisted did, viz. something that wasn\u2019t physical. So\nwhen truth-making is understood in this weakened sense there is no\nneed to acknowledge, e.g., an additional totality fact to make it true\nthat there are only five coins in my pocket; it\u2019s enough that if\nI hadn\u2019t stopped adding coins that statement would have been\nfalse because then there would have been at least one other coin in my\npocket (Heil 2000: 236\u2013240, 2003: 68\u201372, 2006:\n238\u201340; Bricker 2006).\n\nDespite their differences, optimalism and (Truth Supervenes Upon\nBeing) share a key idea in common\u2014that a negative\nexistential truth isn\u2019t true because something exists, but\nbecause something doesn\u2019t, viz. a truth-maker for its\ncontradictory, a false-maker for it. C.B. Martin has objected that\nthis doesn\u2019t obviate the need to posit truth-makers for negative\nexistentials. This is because a statement that there are no\nfalse-makers for a negative existential truth is itself a negative\nexistential truth. So this statement \u201ccan\u2019t be used to\nexplain or show how the latter needs no truth-making state of the\nworld for it to be true\u201d (1996: 61). Lewis takes Martin\u2019s\nobjection to be that this account of the truth of negative truths\nisn\u2019t informative. Take the statement that there are no\nunicorns. Why is it true? Well because there are no\nunicorns. That\u2019s not much of an explanation! But, Lewis retorts,\nthe positive existential statement that there is a cat is true because\nthere is a cat. That\u2019s \u201cNo explanation at all, and none\nthe worse for that\u201d (Lewis 2001: 611\u201312). Fair enough; but\nperhaps Martin meant that optimalists and their fellow-travellers were\npresupposing what they set out to show\u2014because they assumed\nwithout argument that a special class of negative claims stood in no\nneed of truth-makers, those according to which other negative\nstatements lacked false makers.\n",
