    "main_text": "Protagoras\n1. Protagoras\n\n\nA key figure in the emergence of this new type of sophist was Protagoras of Abdera, a subject\ncity of the Athenian empire on the north coast of the Aegean. Abdera was\nalso the birthplace of Democritus, whom some later sources represented\nas the teacher of Protagoras. In all probability Democritus was the\nyounger of the two by about thirty years, and the only solid evidence\nof intellectual relations between them is a statement by Plutarch\n(Against Colotes. 1108F) that Democritus argued against Protagorean\nsubjectivism (see below), complemented by Sextus, who reports\n(Against the Mathematicians VII.389\u201390) that Democritus\u2019 arguments included the\nargument that Protagoras\u2019 subjectivism is self-refuting.\nProtagoras was one of the earliest sophists; as presented in\nPlato\u2019s Protagoras (one of our principal sources for\nProtagoras\u2019 life and activities as a teacher) he says (317c) that\nhe is old enough to be the father of anyone present, who included rival\nsophists Hippias and Prodicus, while another Plato passage\n(Meno 91e) says that he practised as a sophist for over forty\nyears till his death at about seventy (probably about 420 BC). In the\nProtagoras he also says (316d\u2013317b) that while the activity of\nsophistry has been practised by poets and other experts from ancient\ntimes, he is the first person to have openly proclaimed himself a\n\u201csophist\u201d and claimed to teach people (sc. how to achieve\nsuccess in life); he thus claims for himself recognition of his\nprofessional status in a role, that of teacher of human excellence as a\nmeans to success in life, which was traditionally claimed by the\npoets\n\n\nSpecifically, in the Protagoras he claims to teach\n\u2018the proper management of one\u2019s own affairs, how best to\nrun one\u2019s household, and the management of public affairs, how to\nmake the most effective contribution to the affairs of the city by word\nand action\u2019, and he accepts Socrates\u2019 account of that\nsubject as \u2018the art of running a city\u2019, which he promises\nwill \u2018make men into good citizens\u2019 (319a). Can we form any\nconception of the means by which this ambitious project of education in\nself-improvement and good citizenship was to be put into effect? In his\n\u2018Great Speech\u2019 in the dialogue (320c\u2013328d) Protagoras\npresents an account of the development of human civilization, with the\naim of showing that the essence of good citizenship consists in justice\nand self-restraint, which are natural to humans in that the\npreservation of the social order, and ultimately the survival of the\nspecies, depend on their being universally inculcated. It is at least\nplausible that this complex of themes, including the development of\ncivilization from primitive beginnings, the nature of social virtue and\nits foundation in human nature, represents some of the content of\nProtagoras\u2019 actual teaching; the list of titles of his works\npreserved by Diogenes Laertius (IX.55) includes \u2018On the\nVirtues\u2019, \u2018On (the) Constitution\u2019 (Peri\nPoliteias) and \u2018On the State of Things in the\nBeginning\u2019. Later in the dialogue he provides a critical reading\nof a poem of Simonides, saying that the ability to specify the good and\nbad parts of a poem and to justify one\u2019s criticisms is a very\nimportant part of education (338e\u2013339a). Relevantly to this, he is\nreported as a pioneer of some aspects of linguistic theory, and of its\napplication to literary criticism. He wrote on correctness in language\n(orthoepeia, Plato, Phaedrus 267c): he is said to\nhave devised a taxonomy of speech acts into assertion, question,\nanswer, command etc. (Diogenes Laertius IX.53\u20134), and to have criticised the opening\nof the Iliad \u2018Sing, goddess, of the wrath of\nAchilles\u2019 on the ground that instead of a prayer, as it ought to\nbe, the phrase is a command (Aristotle Poetics 1456b15\u201316). He is\nalso said both to have classified grammatical genders (Aristotle\nRhetoric 1407b6\u20137) and to have suggested that gender should be\nmodified to fit the sense, so that \u2018wrath\u2019\n(m\u0113nis) in the same line of Homer, which is a\ngrammatical feminine, should be masculine, since wrath is\ncharacteristic of males rather than females (Aristotle Sophistici\nElenchi 173b19\u201320). It is unclear whether these topics and their\napplication to literary criticism are seen primarily as part of an\nindividual\u2019s cultural refinement, something valuable for its own\nsake, or whether the aim is to be able to incorporate exegesis and\ncriticism of poets in forensic or political speeches, as one tactic in\nargument and persuasion.\n\n\nIn any event, we do have some evidence for Protagoras\u2019\nteaching of techniques of argument. Diogenes Laertius\u2019 list of\ntitles includes one, \u2018The Technique of Eristics\u2019\n(Techn\u0113 Eristik\u014dn) which certainly\ndesignates a handbook of argumentative techniques, and another which\nprobably does. The literal title is \u2018On Wrestling\u2019, but it\nis more likely that the wrestling in question is intellectual than\nphysical; there is nothing in our other evidence to suggest that\nProtagoras set himself up as an athletic coach. (It is relevant that\nProtagoras\u2019 celebrated work \u2018Truth\u2019, which began with\nthe famous \u2018Man the Measure\u2019 sentence (see below)\napparently had the alternative title \u2018Overthrowing\u2019 (sc.\nArguments) (Kataballontes).) So Protagoras taught\nargumentative strategies, but we have comparatively little evidence of\nwhat these actually were. The critique of Simonides\u2019 poem\nmentioned above suggests that eliciting a contradiction from\none\u2019s opponent\u2019s statements was one such strategy, since\nwhat Protagoras actually does is to seek to show that Simonides\ncontradicts himself in first asserting that it is hard to become good\nand then in finding fault with Pittacus, one of the so-called\n\u2018Seven Sages\u2019, for saying that it hard to be good.\nSocrates\u2019 description of the audience\u2019s loud applause\n(339d10\u2013e1) is one of the many indications that sophistic argumentative\ncontests had the status of a spectator sport, even to the extent of\nfiguring among the sideshows at the great athletic festivals; in\nPlato\u2019s Lesser Hippias (363c\u2013364a) Hippias\ndescribes how he goes regularly to the Olympic Games to take part in\ncontests of question and answer and has never yet been beaten, and\nsimilarly Protagoras says that he has had verbal contests with many\npeople, and that he would never have become celebrated if he had\nallowed his opponents to dictate the rules of the contest\n(Prot. 335a). According to Diogenes Laertius IX.52 Protagoras\nwas the first to institute such contests. The technique of adversarial\nargument clearly has some connection with two specific claims for which\nProtagoras was famous (or notorious). According to Diogenes Laertius he\nwas the first to maintain that on any matter there are two theses,\nstatements (or perhaps arguments) (logoi) opposed to one\nanother (IX.51 (=DK 80B6a)), and according to Aristotle he claimed\n\u2018to make the weaker (or inferior) logos stronger (or\nsuperior) (ton h\u0113tt\u014d logon\nkreitt\u014d poiein)\u2019 (Rhetoric 1402a23\u20135 (=DK\n80B6b)), for which claim he was, Aristotle says (ibid.), rightly\ncensured. Investigation of what Protagoras may have meant by these\nclaims leads to consideration of his views on truth and reality, and\nspecifically to the \u2018Man the Measure\u2019 doctrine and the\nissue of relativism.\n\n\nWhile relativism, particularly in the area of morality, is popularly\nseen as characteristic of sophists generally (see Bett 1989), in fact\nProtagoras is the only sophist to whom ancient sources ascribe\nrelativistic views, and even in his case the evidence is ambiguous. A\nkey text is the famous \u2018Man the Measure\u2019 sentence, the\nopening sentence of his work entitled \u2018Truth\u2019, which runs\n\u2018Man is the measure of all things, of the things that are that\nthey are and of the things that are not that they are not\u2019\n(Plato, Theaetetus 151e, Sextus Against the Mathematicians VII.60 (=DK 80B1)). In\nthe Theaetetus (our principal source for this aspect of\nProtagoras\u2019 teaching) this is interpreted as a claim of the\nrelativity of the truth of all judgments to the experience or belief of\nthe individual making the judgment, i.e., as subjectivism. On that\ninterpretation, the way things seem to an individual is the way they\nare in fact for that individual. First illustrated by Socrates, who\nquotes this sentence, as a claim concerning sensory appearances, e.g.,\nthat if the wind feels cold to me and warm to you then it is cold for\nme and warm for you, in the course of the dialogue Socrates expands it\nto apply to all judgments, including itself, yielding the result that\nevery belief is true for the person who holds it (and only for them),\nand hence that there is no objective truth on any matter. That this\nsubjectivist interpretation was current in antiquity is shown by\nAristotle\u2019s attribution to Protagoras of the view that \u2018it\nis equally possible to affirm and to deny anything of anything\u2019\n(Metaphysics 1007b20\u201322) and by Sextus\u2019 evidence of\nDemocritus\u2019 critique of Protagoras mentioned above; Sextus\nreports Democritus (and Plato, see Theaetetus 170e\u2013171c) as having\nargued that, given Protagoras\u2019 thesis that every appearance\n(phantasia) is true, the thesis that it is not the case that\nevery appearance is true, \u2018which is itself in accordance with\nappearance (kata phantasian huphistamenon)\u2019 is\ntrue; hence Protagoras\u2019 thesis is self-refuting. But elsewhere in\nthe Theaetetus (167c) Socrates explains Protagoras\u2019 view\nby claiming on his behalf that \u2018whatever things seem to each city\nto be fine and just are so for that city, so long as it maintains them\n(he\u014ds an auta\nnomiz\u0113i)\u2019: i.e., the truth about what\nis fine and just (which appears to indicate the truth of moral\njudgments generally) is relative not to the judgment of the individual,\nbut to that of the society to which the individual belongs. If the wind\nfeels cold to me, and I consequently believe that it is cold, there is\nno objective fact of the matter by reference to which that belief can\nbe false; but if I believe that infanticide is wrong, whereas\ninfanticide is sanctioned by the laws and customs of the state of which\nI am a citizen, then my belief is straightforwardly false, though of\ncourse it would come to be true if the state of which I am a citizen\nchanged its laws and customs so as to condemn infanticide. Within a\nsingle Platonic dialogue, then, Protagoras is represented as\nmaintaining both universal subjectivism and limited social relativism,\nthough those two versions of relativism are mutually inconsistent. And\nthere is a further twist. In the very passage of the\nTheaetetus where, according to Socrates, Protagoras maintains\nthe social relativity of moral judgments (167b\u2013c), he gives a pragmatic\njustification of the role of the expert, both in the individual and in\nthe social context. In the individual case, while no appearance is\ntruer than any other, some appearances are better than others, and it\nis the role of the expert (for instance, the doctor) to produce better\nappearances instead of worse (as those appearances are then judged even\nby the patient); while in the case of cities, some judgments of what is\njust etc. are better than others, and it is the role of the expert (in\nthis case the expert orator) to persuade the city to adopt the better\njudgment. (He adds (167c7\u2013d1) that the sophist improves those whom he\neducates in the same way, implying that not merely collective judgments\nbut also individual judgments (about what?) may be better or worse.)\nThis account of the role of the expert may imply that there are matters\nof fact of what is better and worse independent of the judgement of\nthose whom the expert persuades. E.g., a city might initially judge it\nright to pursue its individual interest without any consideration of\nobligations to other cities, but then be persuaded that it was more in\nits long-term interest to respect treaties. That persuasion presupposes\nthat the question of what is in the city\u2019s long-term interest is\na matter of fact, not merely a matter of how it now seems to the\ncity.\n\n\nThe evidence of the Theaetetus on Protagorean relativism is\ntherefore ambiguous, since in that dialogue he is represented as\nmaintaining a) universal subjectivism, b) social relativism in morality\nand c) objective realism on questions of advantage. The evidence of\nAristotle and Democritus (transmitted by Sextus) indicates that he did\nin fact maintain a), but leaves it open whether the attribution to him\nof b) and c) is historically accurate, thereby indicating inconsistency\non his part, or is due to misinterpretation, deliberate or inadvertent,\non the part of Plato. It should also be recognized that in the\nTheaetetus Socrates only attributes b) and c) to Protagoras in\nhis overarching effort, on Theaetetus\u2019 behalf, to explicate and\ndefend as plausibly as possible the \u2018Man the measure\u2019\ndoctrine before refuting it. The portrayal in the Protagoras\nshows little trace of relativism, either individual or social; instead\nhe maintains that the essential social virtues are justice and\nself-restraint, and that without universal inculcation of those virtues\nthe survival of society is impossible. These claims are presented as\nuniversal truths; there is not the slightest suggestion that in making\nthem Protagoras is merely expressing a preference for these virtues\nwhich happens to prevail, e.g., in Athens, but which might be absent from\nthe mores of some other city. It is clearly implied by his exposition\nthat no such city could exist. On the assumption, adopted above, that\nthe presentation of Protagoras\u2019 social teaching in the dialogue\nis in essentials intended to be historically accurate, we must conclude\nthat Protagoras recognised certain objective truths, not merely on\nquestions of advantage, but in some fundamentals of morality, and\nconsequently that his basic position was inconsistent.\n\n\nYet a further epistemological position is attributed to Protagoras in\na papyrus fragment of the biblical commentator Didymus the Blind\n(fourth century CE), published in 1968. In this he appears neither as\na subjectivist nor as a social relativist, but as a sceptic. In the\nfragment he is represented as saying \u2018To you who are present I\nappear to be sitting, but to someone who is not present I do not\nappear to be sitting. It is unclear whether I am sitting or\nnot\u2019. On this account there is an objective fact of the matter,\nwhich is undiscoverable because different individuals have different\nappearances of what is the case, whereas given subjectivism there is\nno fact of the matter over and above the individual appearances which\nestablish how each thing is for the one being appeared to. This might\nbe yet another inconsistency on the part of Protagoras, but if so it\nis one which has no confirmation from any other source. It is more\nlikely that what the fragment presents is a garbled instance of\nProtagorean subjectivism.  Instead of the genuinely Protagorean\nargument \u2018It seems to A that I am sitting and\nto B that I am not sitting, so I am sitting for A\nand I am not sitting for B\u2019 we have the argument given\nin the fragment. Since the subjectivist thesis is that every belief is\ntrue for the person who has it, from the premisses that A\nbelieves that I am sitting and B does not believe that I am\nsitting (because B has no belief one way or the other), the\ncorrect Protagorean conclusion is not that it is unclear whether I am\nsitting or not sitting, but that it is true for A that I am\nsitting and that it is neither true for B that I am sitting\nnor true for B that I am not sitting.\n\n\nAll of this leaves it unclear what we are to make of the assertion\nthat on every matter there are two logoi opposed to one\nanother, and the claim to make the weaker logos (the)\nstronger. The former cannot be understood as the assertion of universal\nsubjectivism, since it is in fact inconsistent with it. Given universal\nsubjectivism, the claim that the wind is cold for me is not opposed to\nthe claim that it is warm for you, since both are (relatively) true.\nNor, for the same reason, can it be understood as an assertion of\nsocial relativism: the assertion that for girls to exercise naked is\nshameful in Athens is not opposed to the claim that it is not shameful\nin Sparta. Perhaps we should not try to tie this claim tightly to any\ngeneral metaphysical position, but interpret it more loosely as the\nclaim that that on a great many matters there are two sides to the\nquestion. What this might involve is perhaps indicated by the so-called\nDissoi Logoi (i.e., Arguments on Either Side), a short\ntext found appended to some manuscripts of Sextus, generally dated to\nthe end of the fifth century. This text consists for the most part of a\nseries of short discussions of pairs of standardly opposed moral\nproperties, e.g., the good and the bad, the just and the unjust, the\nmost general pattern being a series of arguments to show on the one\nhand that the opposed properties are in fact identical, followed by a\nseries to show that on the other they are non-identical. Mostly the\narguments for identity depend on the relativity of the application of\nthe property, e.g., the bad is the same as the good because disease is\nbad for the patient but good for the doctor, while the arguments for\nnon-identity rely on the absence of relativity, e.g., doing what is good\nfor one\u2019s parents is not the same thing as doing what is bad for\none\u2019s parents. Plainly, there is no inconsistency between the\ntheses of identity and of non-identity, and it is not clear that the\nreader is supposed to be required to choose one rather than the other.\nPerhaps the point is simply to see that, given the appropriate\ndistinctions, there is something to be said either way, with the\nimplication that the correct answer to the question \u2018Is the good\nthe same as the bad, or different?\u2019 is \u2018In one way (i.e.,\nrelative to different things) the same, in another (i.e., relative to\nthe same thing) different\u2019 (see Protagoras 334a\u2013c.).\nThat could be a useful tactic to employ against an opponent who\ninsisted on a \u2018Yes or No\u2019 answer.\n\n\nSimilarly, the claim to make the weaker logos the stronger\nhas nothing to do with relativism, either individual or social. Since,\nas we have seen, relativized beliefs are not in conflict with one\nanother, arguments in favor of them are not in conflict either, and\nhence neither the beliefs themselves nor the arguments in favor of them\ncan be weaker or stronger than one another. Aristotle\u2019s evidence\nin the Rhetoric passage cited above indicates that the context\nof the claim is that of forensic oratory, and specifically that the\narguments in question are arguments from what is likely or plausible,\ne.g., on the one side that it is not likely that a weakling would\nassault a strong man, since he would expect to be beaten up himself\ninstead, and on the other side that it is not likely that a strong man\nwould assault a weakling, since everyone would assume precisely that it\nwas likely that he would do so, hence he would know that he would\nalmost certainly be found guilty, hence in those circumstances it is\nunlikely that he would actually commit the crime. In any case\nof this kind, where it is assumed that the facts cannot be established\nwith certainty, considerations of what is plausible may, given\nsufficient ingenuity, be adduced on either side, and similar arguments\ncan be adduced in the context of political deliberation, where the\nfuture outcome cannot be certain and the decision has to turn on the\nbalance of probabilities. It is likely, then, that this slogan was a\nsales pitch for Protagoras as a teacher of forensic and deliberative\nrhetoric. How ambitious the claim was is hard to determine. It is hard\nto believe that he ventured to claim always to make the prima facie\nweaker case carry the day (which is equivalent to the claim to make\nevery case whatever carry the day), but equally implausible that he\nmerely claimed to make the weaker case stronger than it was before he\ndevised arguments in its favor. Perhaps he simply claimed that he was\ncapable, in the appropriate circumstances, of devising arguments which\nwould turn the weaker case into the stronger one. If so, the claim was\nboth reasonable and, despite Aristotle\u2019s strictures, not\nnecessarily morally discreditable. E.g., the prosecution may have a\nstrong case that Leon committed a theft, since a number of\neye-witnesses identified him as the thief, but if the defence can show\nthat he has an identical twin brother, Pantaleon, who was in the\nvicinity, and further that Pantaleon is a known thief, whereas Leon has\nan unblemished record, the case that Leon is innocent, which was\npreviously the weaker, is now the stronger, and the defence is not\nnecessarily guilty of any sharp practice (even if Leon was in fact\nguilty of the crime). (Of course, a defence counsel who secured an\nacquittal on these grounds while knowing independently that Leon was\nguilty would deserve Aristotle\u2019s disapproval.)\n\n\nTo complete our account of Protagoras\u2019 views on language and\nreality we need to mention the thesis that it is impossible to say what\nis false, which occurs in three Platonic passages, Euthydemus\n284a\u2013c, Theaetetus 188d\u2013189a and Sophist 236e\u2013237e. According\nto this argument falsehood is impossible, since to say what is false is\nto say what is not (legein to m\u0113 on),\nwhereas anyone who speaks has to say something that is (on\nti); hence saying what is not is saying what is not anything, i.e.,\nnot saying anything. Hence, since of contradictory statements one must\nbe false, it is not possible to contradict (ouk estin\nantilegein  (Euthydemus 286b)). This argument has its origin\nin Parmenides\u2019 claim (DK 28B2) that \u2018You could not know\nwhat is not \u2026 nor could you say it\u2019, and its application\nto falsehood and the impossibility of contradiction is ascribed to\nvarious fifth-century figures, including \u2018Protagoras and his\nassociates and even earlier people\u2019 (hoi amphi\nPr\u014dtagoran \u2026 kai hoi eti palaioteroi\n(Euthydemus 286c2\u20133)), Prodicus (in another fragment of Didymus,\npublished in 1966), Cratylus (Cratylus 429d) and Antisthenes (Aristotle\nMetaphysics 1024b32\u20134). In the case of the latter two the\nthesis connects with other more general theses about language which\nthey are reported to have held. Thus Cratylus has attributed to him by\nPlato the thesis that each thing has its own proper name, which\nexpresses, through its etymology, the nature of the things it names,\nand which has significance only when correctly applied, but is\notherwise a mere empty sound. Hence there can no such thing as the\nmisapplication of a name (since a misapplied name is not a name, but a\nmere sound), and hence no such thing as a false statement, since (it is\nassumed) every false statement involves the misapplication of some\nname. Similarly Antisthenes held that each thing has its own proper\ndefinition or description, which cannot be applied to anything else,\nfrom which again the impossibility of falsehood follows. In the case of\nProtagoras it is hard to find any such connection. On the most\nplausible construal of subjectivism no one\u2019s belief can\ncontradict anyone else\u2019s belief, but that does not appear to rule\nout an individual\u2019s having inconsistent beliefs. Further,\nsubjectivism does not rule out false statements; I can falsely assert\n\u2018The wind is cold for me\u2019 when in fact it is not cold for\nme. Though Protagoras seems to have had a fairly high tolerance\nthreshold for inconsistency, it is hard to see how one and the same\nperson could assert both that it is impossible to contradict and that\non every matter there are two opposed logoi. The wording of\nthe attribution to Protagoras in the Euthydemus is\nsuspiciously vague, suggesting that Plato is attributing to Socrates a\nvague memory of Protagorean subjectivism, rather than precise recall of\nany particular doctrine.\n",
