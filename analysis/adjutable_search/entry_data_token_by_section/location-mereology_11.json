To conceive of an extended simple, think of an\nextended\u2014say, cubical\u2014object that has no proper parts. The\nidea is not, or not merely, that the cube cannot be physically\nsplit or cut up. Whether or not it can be split is a separate\nquestion. The idea is that there are no proper parts of the cube.\nAlthough the object is cubical, it has no top half or bottom half, no\nleft half or right half. All there is, in the relevant vicinity, is\nthe cube itself\u2014together with the region at which it is exactly\nlocated and the parts of that region.\n\nDebates about extended simples typically focus on the question of\nwhether extended simple material objects are possible. But entities in\nother ontological categories (tropes, universals, sets, regions) are\nsometimes thought to be located. So it is worth keeping in mind that,\nwhatever one thinks about material objects, one might hold that\nextended simples in other categories are possible. With that said, we\nwill focus on material objects for the remainder of this section.\n",
