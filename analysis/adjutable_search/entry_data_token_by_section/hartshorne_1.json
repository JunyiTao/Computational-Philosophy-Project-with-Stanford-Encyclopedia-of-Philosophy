    "main_text": "Method\n2. Method\n\nThree primary methodological devices or procedures are at work in\nHartshorne\u2019s metaphysics. First, he very often uses a systematic\nexhaustion of theoretical options\u2014or the development of position\nmatrices, sometimes containing thirty-two alternatives(!)\u2014in\nconsidering philosophical problems. This procedure is evident\nthroughout his philosophy, but it is most apparent in his various\ntreatments of the ontological argument. To take another example, he\nthinks it important to notice that regarding the mind-body problem\nthere are three options available to us, not two, as is usually\nassumed: some form of dualism, some form of the materialist view that\npsyche is reducible to body, and some form of the panpsychist\n(or, as he terms it, psychicalist) view that body is in some way\nreducible to psyche if all concrete singulars (e.g., cells or\nelectrons) in some way show signs of self-motion or activity. Thomas\nNagel famously considers this third option, but Hartshorne actually\ndefends it. The recent surge of interest in panpsychism indicates that\nHartshorne was ahead of his time by several decades in his ideas in\nphilosophy of mind.\n\nSecond, Hartshorne frequently uses the history of philosophy to see\nwhich of the logically possible options made available by position\nmatrices have been defended before so as to avail ourselves of the\ninsights of others in the effort to examine in detail the consistency\nof these positions and to assess their consequences. Nonetheless,\nthose logically possible options that have not historically found\nsupport should be analyzed both in terms of internal consistency and\npractical ramifications. It should be noted that Hartshorne\u2019s\nuse of the history of philosophy often involves lesser known views of\nfamous thinkers (like Plato\u2019s belief in God as the soul for the\nbody of the whole natural world, or Leibniz\u2019s defense of\npanpsychism) as well as the thought of lesser known thinkers (such as\nFaustus Socinus, Nicholas Berdyaev, Mohammed Iqbal, or Jules\nLecquier).\n\nThird, after a careful reading of the history of philosophy has\nfacilitated the conceptual and pragmatic examination of all the\navailable options made explicit by a position matrix, the (Greek)\nprinciple of moderation is used by Hartshorne as a guide to negotiate\nthe way between extreme views on either side. For example, regarding\nthe issue of personal identity, the view of Hume (and of Bertrand\nRussell at one stage in his career) is that, strictly speaking, there\nis no personal identity in that each event in \u201ca person\u2019s\nlife\u201d is externally related to the others. This is just as\ndisastrous, Hartshorne thinks, as Leibniz\u2019s view that all such\nevents are internally related to the others, so that implicit in the\nfetus are all the experiences of the adult. (This Leibnizian view\nrelies on the classical theistic, strong notion of omniscience,\nwherein God knows in minute detail and with absolute assurance what\nwill happen in the future.) The Humean view fails to explain the\ncontinuity we experience in our lives and the Leibnizian view fails to\nexplain the indeterminateness we experience when considering the\nfuture. The truth lies between these two extremes, Hartshorne thinks.\nHis view of personal identity is based on a conception of time as\nasymmetrical in which later events in a person\u2019s life are\ninternally related to former events, but they are externally related\nto those that follow, thus leading to a position that is at once\npartially deterministic and partially indeterministic. That is, the\npast supplies necessary but not sufficient conditions for human\nidentity in the present, which always faces a partially indeterminate\nfuture.\n\nOnly the first of these methodological devices or procedures supports\nthe widely held claim that Hartshorne is a rationalist. His overall\nmethod is a complex one that involves the other two methods or\nprocedures, where he does borrow from the rationalists, but also from\nthe pragmatists and the Greeks. It must be admitted, however, that\nHartshorne was educated in a philosophic world still heavily\ninfluenced by late nineteenth and early twentieth century\nidealism.\n",
