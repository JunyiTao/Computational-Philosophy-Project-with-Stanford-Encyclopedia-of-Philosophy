    "main_text": "The Prince: Analyzing Power\n2. The Prince: Analyzing Power\n\nTraditionally, political philosophers of the past posited a special\nrelationship between moral goodness and legitimate authority. Many\nauthors (especially those who composed mirror-of-princes books or\nroyal advice books during the Middle Ages and Renaissance) believed\nthat the use of political power was only rightful if it was exercised\nby a ruler whose personal moral character was strictly virtuous. Thus\nrulers were counseled that if they wanted to succeed\u2014that is, if\nthey desired a long and peaceful reign and aimed to pass their office\ndown to their heirs\u2014they must be sure to behave in accordance\nwith conventional ethical standards, that is, the virtues and piety.\nIn a sense, it was thought that rulers did well when they did good;\nthey earned the right to be obeyed and respected on account of their\nmoral and religious rectitude (see Briggs and Nederman 2022).\n\nMachiavelli criticized at length precisely this moralistic view of\nauthority in his best-known treatise, The Prince. For\nMachiavelli, there is no moral basis on which to judge the difference\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate uses of power. Rather, authority\nand power are essentially coequal: whoever has power has the right to\ncommand; but goodness does not ensure power and the ruler has no more\nauthority on account of being good. Thus, in direct opposition to\nmorally derived theories of politics, Machiavelli says that the only\nreal concern in politics is the acquisition and maintenance of power\n(although he talks less about power per se than about\n\u201cmaintaining the state\u201d). In this sense, Machiavelli\npresents a trenchant criticism of the concept of authority by arguing\nthat the notion of legitimate rights of rulership adds nothing to the\nactual possession of power. The Prince purports to reflect\nthe self-conscious political realism of an author who is fully\naware\u2014on the basis of direct experience in the service of the\nFlorentine government\u2014that goodness and right are not sufficient\nto win and maintain political supremacy. Machiavelli thus seeks to\nlearn and teach the rules of political power. For him, it necessary\nfor any successful ruler to know how to use power effectively. Only by\nmeans of its proper application, Machiavelli believes, can individuals\nbe brought to obey and will the ruler be able to maintain the state in\nsafety and security.\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s political theory, then, excludes issues of moral\nauthority and legitimacy from consideration in the discussion of\npolitical decision-making and political judgment. Nowhere does this\ncome out more clearly than in his treatment of the relationship\nbetween law and force. Machiavelli acknowledges that good laws and\ngood arms constitute the dual foundations of a well-ordered political\nsystem. But he immediately adds that since coercion creates legality,\nhe will concentrate his attention on force. He says, \u201cSince\nthere cannot be good laws without good arms, I will not consider laws\nbut speak of arms\u201d (Prince CW 47). In other words,\nvalid law rests entirely upon the threat of coercive force; authority\nis impossible for Machiavelli as a right apart from the power to\nenforce it. Machiavelli is led to conclude that fear is always\npreferable to affection in subjects, just as violence and deception\nare superior to legality in effectively controlling them. He observes\nthat\n\none can say this in general of men: they are ungrateful, disloyal,\ninsincere and deceitful, timid of danger and avid of profit\u2026.\nLove is a bond of obligation which these miserable creatures break\nwhenever it suits them to do so; but fear holds them fast by a dread\nof punishment that never passes. (Prince CW 62; translation\nrevised)\n\n\nAs a result, Machiavelli cannot really be said to have a theory of\nobligation separate from the imposition of power; people obey only\nbecause they fear the consequences of not doing so, whether the loss\nof life or of privileges. And of course, power alone cannot bind one,\ninasmuch as obligation is voluntary and assumes that one can\nmeaningfully do otherwise. Someone can choose not to obey only if he\npossesses the power to resist the ruler or is prepared to risk the\nconsequences of the state\u2019s superiority of coercive force.\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s argument in The Prince is thus designed\nto demonstrate that politics can only properly be defined in terms of\nthe effective employment of coercive power, what Yes Winter (2018) has\ntermed \u201cthe orders of violence.\u201d Authority as a right to\ncommand has no independent status. He substantiates this assertion by\nreference to the observable realities\u2014historical and\ncontemporary\u2014of political affairs and public life as well as by\narguments revealing the self-interested tendencies of all human\nconduct. For Machiavelli it is meaningless and futile to speak of any\nclaim to the authority to command detached from the possession of\nsuperior political power. The ruler who lives by his supposed rights\nalone will surely wither and die by those same rights, because in the\nrough-and-tumble of political conflict those who prefer power to\nauthority are more likely to succeed. Without exception the authority\nof states and their laws will never be acknowledged when they are not\nsupported by a show of power which renders obedience inescapable.\n",
