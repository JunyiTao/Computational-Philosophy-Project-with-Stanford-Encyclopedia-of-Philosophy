    "main_text": "Pluralism and Rational Choice || Accepting Incomparability\n4.4 Accepting Incomparability\n\nOne philosopher who is happy to accept that there may be situations\nwhere we just cannot make reasoned choices between plural values is\nIsaiah Berlin, who claimed that goods such as liberty and equality\nconflict at the fundamental level. Berlin is primarily concerned with\npolitical pluralism, and with defending political liberalism, but his\nviews about incomparability have been very influential in discussions\non moral pluralism. Bernard Williams (1981), Charles Larmore (1987),\nJohn Kekes (1993), Michael Stocker (1990 and 1997), David Wiggins\n(1997) have all argued that there are at least some genuinely\nirresolvable conflicts between values, and that to expect a rational\nresolution is a mistake. (See also the entry on\n moral dilemmas).\n For Williams this is part of a more general mistake made by\ncontemporary moral philosophers\u2014he thinks that philosophy tries\nto make ethics too easy, too much like arithmetic. Williams insists\nthroughout his writings that ethics is a much more complex and\nmulti-faceted beast than its treatment at the hands of moral\nphilosophers would suggest, and so it is not surprising to him that\nthere should be situations where values conflict irresolvably. Stocker\n(1990) discusses the nature of moral conflict at great length, and\nalthough he thinks that many apparent conflicts can be dissolved or\nare not serious, like Williams, he argues that much of contemporary\nphilosophy\u2019s demand for simplicity is mistaken. Stocker argues\nthat ethics need not always be action guiding, that value is much more\ncomplex than Kantians and utilitarians would have us think, and that\nas the world is complicated we will inevitably face conflicts. Several\npluralists have argued that accepting the inevitability of value\nconflicts does not result in a breakdown of moral argument, but rather\nthe reverse. Kekes (1993), for example, claims that pluralism enables\nus to see that irresolvable disagreements are not due to wickedness on\nthe part of our interlocutor, but may be due to the plural nature of\nvalues.\n",
