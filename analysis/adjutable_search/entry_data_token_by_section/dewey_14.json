    "main_text": "Experience and Metaphysics || The Project of Experience and Nature\n3.6 The Project of Experience and Nature\n\nExperience and Nature provides both extended criticism of\npast metaphysical approaches, especially their quest for certainty and\nassumption of an Appearance/Reality framework, and a positive, general\ntheory regarding how human existence is situated in nature. It is\nproffered as empirical, descriptive, and hypothetical; it eschews\nclaims of special access beyond \u201cexperience in unsophisticated\nforms\u201d, which, Dewey argued, give us \u201cevidence of a\ndifferent world and points to a different metaphysics\u201d\n(EN, LW1: 47). EN looks to existing characteristics\nof human culture, anthropologically, to see what they reveal, more\ngenerally, about nature. The isolation, analysis, and description of\nthe \u201cgeneric traits of existence\u201d and their relations to\none another, is one significant outcome.\n\nWhile this entry lacks space for even a bare summary, it is worth\nnoting that EN begins with an extensive discussion of method\nand experience as a new starting point for philosophy. An extensive\npresentation of the generic traits follows, which, in due course,\nevokes and informs discussions regarding science, technology, body,\nmind, language, art, and value. While the traits are not presented\nsystematically (\u00e0 la other metaphysicians such as Spinoza or\nWhitehead) there is a progression moving from the more basic to the\nmore\n complex.[17]\n",
