    "main_text": "Perception and Knowledge of the World || The Way of Ideas and Representational Theories of Perception\n3.1 The Way of Ideas and Representational Theories of Perception\n\n\nWhen discussing Reidian conception, we contrasted Reid's analysis of\nthis faculty with the Way of Ideas'. For Reid, conceptions or \u2018simple\napprehensions\u2019 possess intentional content in virtue of which these\nmental states are about other things. Conceptions can be about a wide\nvariety of thing: I can conceive of pain, a shooting pain Descartes'\nfoot, penne, and fictional characters like Podrick Payne. However,\naccording to the Way of Ideas, I can conceive only of one type of\nthing: Ideas. According to the Way of Ideas, this holds true not\nonly for conception but for all other faculties. If I tactilely\nperceive a pillow, my perceptual mental state is not about the pillow\nbut rather it is about my idea or mental representation of the\npillow. The basic structure of the representational theory of\nperception (and conception, memory, etc.) is explicitly endorsed by\nDescartes, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and many other Early Modern\nphilosophers, as well as many living philosophers. We doubt that there\nis any other philosophical commitment that more exercised Reid's mind\nthan this one, which he thought to be a source of ruin for many\nreasons. Both Reid and Richard Rorty see the Way of Ideas'\nrepresentationalism as the key player in the story of Early Modern\nWestern philosophy (Rorty 1981), which would continue as the story of\ncontemporary analytic philosophy.\n\n\nTo the basic structure of the representational theory of perception,\none of many components can be added to explain how we are \u2018aware\u2019 of\nexternal, physical objects even though the immediate object of\nperception is an idea. Here are three possibilities: (1) we are aware\nof external objects directly by perceiving\nrepresentations of them, ideas; (2) we infer the existence\nand nature of external objects by perceiving ideas of them; or (3)\nthere is no distinction between external objects and ideas, and, thus,\nwhen we perceive ideas we are perceiving external objects.\n\n \nOn option (1), the representationalist would need to offer an\nexplanation of what it is that is so special about ideas that makes it\nthe case that whenever we are perceiving an idea, we are directly\naware of that which it represents. If this burden can be discharged,\nthen it is possible to say that we are aware of external objects and\nremain consistent with the representational theory. In the history of\nphilosophy Reid documents a series of failed efforts to explain how it\nis that perception of something in the mind could amount to any direct\nperception or awareness of some external object. These attempts make\nthe mistake, he thinks, of giving unexplained and unexplainable powers\nto ideas: how could they possibly, all by themselves, attach our minds\nto objects whenever they are perceived? This question cannot be\nanswered, so he thinks.\n\n\nAs to (2), Reid thinks that nobody who has absorbed Hume's lessons\nregarding causation would think that we can avoid skepticism about the\nexternal world while insisting that we infer its nature from the\nfeatures of directly perceived ideas. On the representational model,\nexternal objects are the causes of our ideas. But if Hume is right\nabout causation then we can only infer the nature of a particular\nunobserved cause of a particular observed effect when we have had\nrepeated experience of conjunction of similar causes with similar\neffects. But according to the Way of Ideas we have never in fact had\nany experience of the relevant causes, namely physical objects and\ntheir qualities; we have only experienced their effects on our minds,\nideas. Therefore, we can infer nothing about external objects by\nexamination of the ideas which they cause in us. Option (2) appears to\ngive skepticism a foothold.\n\n\nAs to (3), Reid believes that it amounts to an endorsement of\nidealism. Reid finds this theory implausible on its own, and in\nviolation of a host of common sense principles, despite the fact that\nhe admires Berkeley's efforts to pursue its full implications. Reid's\narguments against representationalist attempts to recover the\nawareness of the external world through perception via options (1),\n(2) and (3) are by no means all of his arguments against the\nrepresentationalist theory of perception or the Way of Ideas. We now\nintroduce a few additional considerations for which Reid rejects that\ntheory.\n",
