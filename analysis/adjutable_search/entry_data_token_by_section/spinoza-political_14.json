    "main_text": "The Tractatus Politicus\n4. The Tractatus Politicus\n\n\nOne might wonder why Spinoza, having published the TTP in 1670, spent\nthe last years of his life (until his death in 1677) working on a\nsecond political treatise that covers some of the same ground as the\nfirst. It is tempting to suppose that he must have come to reject many\nof his earlier views. However, with the possible exception of his view\nof the social contract (see 4.1), there is little evidence that\nSpinoza came to reject any of the central claims of his earlier\ntreatise. Rather, the TP is distinguished from the earlier treatise\nchiefly by its aims and rhetorical style. Whereas the TTP was an\noccasional piece, written for an audience of liberal Christian\ntheologians to address the problems posed by officious Calvinist\ntheocrats, the TP is concerned with the general organization of the\nstate and was written for philosophers. In the later treatise, Spinoza\nabandons what has been described as the \u201ctheological idiom of\npopular persuasion\u201d in favor of the dispassionate style of a\npolitical scientist (Feuer 1987, 151; cf. Balibar 1998, 50).\n\n\nThe TP is a fitting sequel to the Ethics (Matheron 1969).\nWhereas the Ethics reveals the path to individual freedom, the\nTP reveals the extent to which individual freedom depends on\ncivil institutions (Steinberg 2018a). We should not be surprised to find Spinoza\u2019s philosophy taking a civic turn near the end of his life. From his earliest writings, he claims that he is\nconcerned not just to perfect his own nature but also \u201cto form a\nsociety of the kind that is desirable, so that as many as possible may\nattain [a flourishing life] as easily and surely as possible\u201d\n(TdIE, \u00a714). The TP may be seen as Spinoza\u2019s\nattempt to articulate some of the conditions for the possibility of such a\nsociety.\n\n\nThe work can be divided into three sections. In the first section\n(roughly through Chapter 4), Spinoza discusses the metaphysical basis\nof the state and the natural limits of state power. In the second\nsection (Chapter 5), Spinoza lays out the general aims of the state.\nAnd in the third section (Chapter 6 to the end), Spinoza gives specific\nrecommendations for how various regime forms\u2014monarchy,\naristocracy, and democracy\u2014are to be constituted so as to satisfy\nthe aims of the state as set out in section two.\n",
