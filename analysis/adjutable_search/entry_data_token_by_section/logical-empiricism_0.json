    "main_text": "Mapping the Movement\n1. Mapping the Movement\n\nThe term \u2018logical empiricism\u2019 has no very precise\nboundaries and still less that distinguishes it from \u2018logical\npositivism\u2019. It is therefore hard to map. \u2018Logical\nempiricism\u2019 here includes three groups: (1) the Vienna Circle,\nhere taken broadly to include those who were part of various private\ndiscussion groups, especially that around Moritz Schlick, and also the\nmembers of the more public Ernst Mach Society (Verein Ernst Mach), (2)\nthe smaller, but perhaps more influential Berlin Society for Empirical\nPhilosophy (later called the Berlin Society for Scientific\nPhilosophy), and (3) those influenced by or who interacted with\nmembers of the first two groups and shared an intellectual kinship\nwith them. Besides Vienna and Berlin, there were important centers of\nthe movement in England, France, Scandinavia, at several universities\nin the U.S., and even China. This characterization includes thinkers\nwho disagreed with doctrines espoused by members of the original\ngroups and even some who defined themselves in opposition to the\nmovement. This results in a vague boundary, but it suffices to\nidentify a movement in which a large number of able philosophers\nself-consciously participated and to distinguish logical empiricism\nfrom other movements.\n\nIt does not, however, distinguish logical empiricism from logical\npositivism, and it is doubtful that any principled such boundary can\nbe drawn along doctrinal or sociological lines (Uebel 2013). Usually\nwhen distinctions are drawn, \u2018logical empiricism\u2019 is the\nwider term. Members of the Berlin group never used the term\n\u2018positivism\u2019 about themselves, but did use it concerning\nsome unnamed Viennese in stressing their differences from the latter.\nIn any case, these differences, even if real, were smaller than the\ndifferences within the Vienna Circle on one hand or within the Berlin\ngroup on the other. \u2018Positivist\u2019 is a term usually applied\nby opponents of various doctrines. It was used by some of the Viennese\nlogical empiricists about themselves but generally with caution and in\nstressing the differences between their own views and those of the\n19th century positivists. The one philosopher who would\nhave unhesitatingly described himself as (having been) a logical\npositivist was A.J. Ayer.\n\nAnother way of mapping the boundaries of logical empiricism is to list\nthe specific philosophers who were centrally or peripherally part of\nit. This included many of the most important philosophers of the\nmid-twentieth century. Hans Hahn, Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and\nOtto Neurath were leaders of the Vienna Circle, and Kurt G\u00f6del\nregularly attended its meetings. The list of its members, visitors,\nand interlocutors is staggering, including A.J. Ayer, Herbert Feigl,\nPhilipp Frank, Hans Hahn, Carl Hempel, Karl Menger, Richard von Mises,\nErnest Nagel, Karl Popper, W.V. Quine, Frank Ramsay, Hans Reichenbach,\nAlfred Tarski, Friedrich Waismann, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among many\nothers. Not all of these would admit to being part of the logical\nempiricist movement, of course, but a case can be made that all\ncontributed to it. The Berlin Society for Empirical (or Scientific)\nPhilosophy was, as stated, smaller but perhaps more influential. Led\nby Hans Reichenbach, it included Kurt Grelling, Walter Dubislav, Kurt\nLewin, Richard von Mises, Paul Oppenheim, and others. Hempel took his\ndoctorate in Berlin, working with Reichenbach until the latter was\nforced to leave in 1933. Hempel also spent time in Vienna and Prague.\nOf course, among the foremost associates of the Berlin Society was\nAlbert Einstein, who was also in Berlin also until 1933.\n\nThere was also an important group of logicians in Warsaw of which\nAlfred Tarski is the best known. Tarski interacted significantly with\nthe logical empiricists in Vienna, Berlin, and the U.S., but it is\nmore reasonable to classify the Polish logicians as an allied group\nrather than include them within the logical empiricist movement.\n\nBecause of the catastrophic dislocations of Europe in the 1930s, the\nmain focus of the logical empiricism moved from central Europe to\nAmerica by the close of that decade. Erkenntnis, the main\njournal of the movement, which had been edited by Reichenbach and\nCarnap, ceased publication by 1940. In 1930 Feigl moved to the U.S.,\nand Carnap moved to Chicago in 1936. Hempel came to Chicago and Menger\nto Notre Dame in 1937. The ensuing years witnessed a massive exodus to\nAmerica from central Europe. Reichenbach arrived in the U.S. in 1938\nafter five years in Turkey. Also in 1938 Gustav Bergmann and Philipp\nFrank emigrated. Edgar Zilsel came in 1939. Alfred Tarski was on a\nvisit to the U.S. when Poland was invaded in 1939, and so he stayed.\nAnd by 1940 Richard von Mises was also in America.\n\nIn the U.S., these exiles were joined by the Americans Nelson Goodman,\nCharles Morris, W.V. Quine, Ernest Nagel, and, after the war, by\nReichenbach\u2019s UCLA students Hilary Putnam and Wesley Salmon.\nAdolf Gr\u00fcnbaum can also be considered as clearly in the\nReichenbach lineage. And Wilfrid Sellars was, in his early years, a\nclose associate of Feigl. The American incarnation of the logical\nempiricist movement enjoyed generally good relations with the American\npragmatists, not only because many of the logical empiricists had a\nstrong pragmatist component to their philosophy, but also because the\npragmatists and logical empiricists shared a common concern for\nempirical methodology in the service of social reform.\nInstitutionally, the movement was represented in most major American\nuniversities, and such journals as Philosophy of Science\n(with Carnap and Feigl on the Editorial Board and Reichenbach and\nSchlick on the Advisory Board) and Philosophical Studies\n(founded and edited for many years by Feigl and Sellars) provided\nample outlet for their publications. In addition, the Inter-Scientific\nDiscussion Group was founded by Philipp Frank at Harvard. That grew\ninto the Institute for the Unity of Science, called by some the Vienna\nCircle in exile. Meanwhile in Chicago the Encyclopedia of Unified\nScience was established with Neurath, Carnap, and Morris as its\neditors.\n\nBut even from late 30s onward the movement was hardly limited to\nAmerica. Ayer remained in England. Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge\nin 1929, but with regular visits to Vienna, including those on which\nhe discussed issues surrounding a strong version of verificationism\nwith Schlick and Waismann. Popper fled to New Zealand in 1937, and in\n1946 moved to the London School of Economics. Neurath fled from Vienna\nto the Hague and then again in 1940 to England, where he remained till\nhis death in 1945. Friedrich Waismann went to England in 1937. In 1939\nRose Rand, a less well-known member of the Vienna Circle, fled to\nEngland and then in 1954 emigrated once more to the U.S. There were\nlike-minded thinkers in Scandinavia (such as J\u00f8rgen\nJ\u00f8rgensen, Eino Kaila, and Arne Naess) and as far away as\nArgentina (H.A. Lindemann) and China (Tscha Hung).\n\nIt is impossible to say when logical empiricism ceased to be\nsufficiently cohesive to be identifiable as a continuing movement.\nCertainly by 1960 a great many philosophers, including many who had\nearlier clearly been part of the movement, were identifying themselves\nin opposition to what they took to be logical empiricism. And some\nmembers simply changed their minds or pursued different projects.\nLogical empiricism probably never commanded the assent of the majority\nof philosophers in either Europe or America, and by 1970 the movement\nwas pretty clearly over\u2014though with lasting influence whether\nrecognized or not. In the 1980s there was a resurgence of historical\ninterest in logical empiricism. That historical interest continues to\nclear away many of the caricatures and misconceptions about the\nlogical empiricists. Among the major results of this work is the\nrecognition of the tremendous variety and subtlety of views\nrepresented within the movement and the fact that many of the\narguments later deployed by critics of logical empiricism had been\npioneered by the logical empiricists themselves.\n\nGiven the emphasis on science and its technical apparatus, social\nrenewal, clarity and rationality of belief, functionality, and above\nall the palpable sense of doing philosophy in an importantly new way,\nit is reasonable to associate logical empiricism with other forms of\nEuropean modernism in the 1920s and 30s, such as Neue Sachlichkeit in\nart and the Bauhaus in architecture and design, and with mid-century\nmodernism as well as with political liberalism, from the New Deal to\nthe Great Society in the United States. There have been recognizably\nmodernist developments in various fields including philosophy for\ncenturies.\n",
