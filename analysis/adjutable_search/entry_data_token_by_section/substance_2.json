    "main_text": "History of the Philosophical Debate on Substance || Substance before Aristotle\n2.1 Substance before Aristotle\n\nMany of the pre-Socratic philosophers in fact had a concept of\nsubstance rather like that above attributed to chemistry: that is,\ntheir emphasis was on criterion (vi) above. They thought, that is,\nthat the being of the universe (hence they were pursuing substance in\nsense (i)) consisted in some kind or kinds of stuff. Thales, for\nexample, thought that everything was essentially water, and Anaximenes\nthat everything was a form of air. For Anaximander, the\n\u2018stuff\u2019 in question was indeterminate, so that it could\ntransmute into the various determinate stuffs such as water, air earth\nand fire. By contrast, atomists such as Democritus took those\ndeterminate particular objects they called \u2018atoms\u2019 to be\nthe substance of the universe. Atoms are objects in our ordinary\nsense, though they are not our ordinary objects: they are not dogs and\ncats or tables and chairs. They are the subjects of predication, but\nthey do not change their intrinsic properties. Classical atoms are,\ntherefore, strong instances of (i) and (ii), but somewhat deviant\ncases of (iii) and (v).\n\nPlato rejected these materialist attempts to explain everything on the\nbasis of that of which it was made. According to Plato, the governing\nprinciples were the intelligible Forms, which material objects\nattempted to copy. These Forms are not substances in the sense of\nbeing either the stuff or the individuals or the kinds of individuals\nout of which all else is constructed. Rather they are the driving\nprinciples that give structure and purpose to everything else. In\nitself, the rest would be, at most, an unintelligible chaos. The Forms\nmeet criterion (i)\u2014ontological basicness\u2014but in a slightly\neccentric way, because they do not, in a normal sense, constitute\nthings. They meet (ii)\u2014durability\u2014in a strong fashion, for\nthey are eternal. They are not, in the intended senses, the subjects\nof predication, and in no sense the subjects of change, so they do\nbadly on (iii) and (iv). They do not do well on (v) for they are not\nindividual things in any normal sense, though they are individuals, of\na very unusual kind. (Aristotle\u2019s main criticism of\nPlato\u2019s Forms was that they are a bastard confusion of universal\nand particular; see Fine 1993.) They are in no way kinds of stuff,\nhence failing (vi). But failure to meet these standards is not\ncarelessness on Plato\u2019s part. It reflects his emphasis on\ncriterion (i), together with his particular view about the way in\nwhich forms are basic.\n2.2. Aristotle\u2019s account of substance\n\nThere are two main sources for Aristotle\u2019s approach to\nsubstance, the Categories and Metaphysics Z. These\nwill be discussed in turn.\n2.2.1 Categories\n\nAristotle\u2019s account in Categories can, with some\noversimplification, be expressed as follows. The primary\nsubstances are individual objects, and they can be contrasted\nwith everything else\u2014secondary substances and all other\npredicables\u2014because they are not predicable of or attributable\nto anything else. Thus, Fido is a primary substance, and\ndog\u2014the secondary substance\u2014can be predicated of\nhim. Fat, brown, and taller than Rover are\nalso predicable of him, but in a rather different way from that in\nwhich dog is. Aristotle distinguishes between two kinds of\npredicables, namely those that are \u2018said of\u2019 objects and\nthose that are \u2018in\u2019 objects. The interpretation of these\nexpressions is, as usually with Aristotelian cruxes, very\ncontroversial, but a useful way of looking at it is as follows.\nDog is said of Fido because it characterises him as\na whole. Fat and the others are described as being\nin because they pick out a constituent feature that could be said\nto be, in a logical though not a physical sense, part of, or\nin him. Fido the individual is not attributable to any\nfurther thing at all.\n\nThis account is intuitive, but perhaps it cannot be treated as a\nformally adequate definition of the notion of primary substance or\nindividual. Fido the individual could be said to be in a\ncertain location and so attributed to something, namely a place. It is\nnatural to reply to this that an object is not an attribute of a place\nin the same way as a property is an attribute of a thing: the property\nis in a thing \u2018as a subject\u2019, but a place is not a subject\nto which a thing is attributed: the place does not\n\u2018underlie\u2019 the thing as a thing \u2018underlies\u2019\nits properties. Although this may be true, it presupposes that we\nalready have a grasp on the sense in which properties belong to\nobjects and how this differs from the various ways that objects belong\nto or can be attributed to things, and that we can call upon this\ninformal understanding in interpreting the theoretical account.\nWhether this is legitimate might depend on what the objective is. If\nthe objective is to explain the difference between substance and\nproperty in an entirely non-circular way by appealing to the fact that\nproperties are in substances but substances are not in things, this\nwould involve taking the notion of being in as primitive. If\nwe have to distinguish the sense in which properties are in substances\nfrom the way in which substances can be in things\u2014such as\nplaces\u2014before we can make the original point, then there has not\nbeen a non-circular account. If, on the other hand, the objective is\nsimply to differentiate between concepts already in play, then\nCategories achieves its objective.\n\nPerhaps it is better, therefore, to see Aristotle in\nCategories not as defining \u2018substance\u2019, so that\nsomeone wholly lacking the concept might come to understand it, but as\nexhibiting the marks and characteristics of a primitive concept on\nwhich we have an intuitive grasp. If we understand his project in this\nway, we can see Aristotle as presenting various marks of substance in\nCategories. The marks of primary substance are:\n\nBeing objects of predication but not being themselves predicable\nof anything else (at least, not in the way entities in the other\ncategories are: see the problem about attribution to location\nabove).\nBeing able to receive contraries (4 a10). A substance can go from\nbeing hot to being cold, or from being red to being blue, but the\ninstance of blue in an object cannot similarly take on and lose a wide\nrange of attributes.\nIf substance did not exist it would be impossible for things in\nany of the other categories to exist. There could be no instances of\nproperties if there were no substances to possess them.\n\n\nBut these criteria do not show why \u2018dog\u2019 is a secondary\nsubstance term and \u2018brown thing\u2019 is not. So we need marks\nfor being a secondary substance, or substance concept. On\nthis he says two things.\n\n\u201cIt is reasonable that, after the primary substances, their\nspecies and genera should be the only other things called (secondary)\nsubstance. For only they, of things predicated, reveal the primary\nsubstance\u201d. (2 b28\u201330)\n\u201cOf the secondary substances the species is more a substance\nthan the genus, since it is nearer to the primary substance. For if\none is to say of the primary substance what it is, it will be more apt\nto give the species than the genus\u201d. (2 b8\u201311)\n\n\nThe second of these two points is more uncontroversial than the first,\nfor it is indubitable that species terms focus more precisely on\nparticular things than generic terms. The first is, however, once\nagain intuitive but not compelling. It appeals to the fundamental\nintuition that \u2018dog\u2019 tells you what Fido is\nbetter than \u2018brown thing\u2019 does, but does not really give a\nreason for this claim. Only in\n section 3.3,\n when we discuss Wiggins\u2019s theory, will we find more formal\nreasons for treating species or sortal concepts as more revealing of\n\u2018what something really is\u2019 than are other terms.\n\nThe division between being said of and being\nin\u2014that is, between substance concepts and other\nproperties\u2014seems intuitively clear enough until one remembers\nthat substance concepts are complex and are definable in terms of\nother properties. Thus, \u2018man\u2019 is defined as\n\u2018featherless biped\u2019 or \u2018rational animal\u2019, and\nit would seem that \u2018featherless\u2019, \u2018two-footed\u2019\nor \u2018rational\u2019 are properties and hence the kinds of things\nthat are in objects. Aristotle denies that this is so when\nthey enter into the definition of a substance. The features that\nspecifically make an object the kind of substance that it is, are\ncalled differentiae, and Aristotle says\n\nthe differentia also is not in a subject. For footed and two-footed\nare said of man as subject, but are not in a subject; neither footed\nnor two-footed is in man. (3 a23\u20135)\n\n\nIt would seem that these properties belong to objects in different\nways when they are part of a definition from when they are not. The\nissue is what constitutes the unity of the species or secondary\nsubstance: why is it not just a collection of properties and, if it is\njust such a collection, why is it so different from any other\ncollection of properties? In order to begin to see how Aristotle\ntackled this problem we need the apparatus of form and matter, which\ndoes not appear in the Categories. (We will see when\ndiscussing contemporary theories in\n section 3.1,\n however, that it is not clear that even now can we provide a wholly\nnon-circular account of substance.)\n2.2.2 Metaphysics\n\nThe Categories sets out important logical distinctions\nbetween different kinds of attribute, but it does not enter into a\nmetaphysical analysis of substance itself. This takes place mainly in\nMetaphysics, Book Z. In the latter, the analysis of\nsubstances in terms of form and matter is developed, whereas these\nnotions have no place in Categories. The distinction has led\nsome commentators to talk of Aristotle\u2019s \u2018two\nsystems\u2019, containing two radically different conceptions of\nsubstance (Graham 1987). In the earlier, Categories,\nsubstances are simply individuals; in the later work they are\ncomplexes of form and matter. Whether this represents a change of\nview, or whether the purposes of the Categories simply did\nnot require reference to the metaphysical analysis of substance is a\nmoot point. It seems unlikely, however, given Aristotle\u2019s\nPlatonic background, that his early thought was oblivious to the role\nof form in substance. Whichever interpretation of the development of\nAristotle\u2019s thought is correct, the introduction of\nsubstantial form is what gives the fully developed\nAristotelian account of substance.\n\nAristotle analyses substance in terms of form and matter. The form is\nwhat kind of thing the object is, and the matter is what\nit is made of. The term \u2018matter\u2019 as used by Aristotle\nis not the name for a particular kind of stuff, nor for some ultimate\nconstituents of bodies, such as atoms (Aristotle rejects atomism).\n\u2018Matter\u2019 is rather the name for whatever, for a given kind\nof object, meets a certain role or function, namely that of being that\nfrom which the object is constituted. Relative to the human body,\nmatter is flesh and blood. The matter of an axehead is the iron from\nwhich it is made. Relative to the elements, earth, fire, air, and\nwater, matter is an intrinsically characterless \u2018prime\nmatter\u2019 that underlies the qualities of them all.\n\nAristotle acknowledges that there are three candidates for being\ncalled substance, and that all three are substance in some sense or to\nsome degree. First, there is matter, second, form and third, the\ncomposite of form and matter. Aristotle acknowledges that matter can\nbe a subject of predication and of change, thereby meeting one of the\nmain criteria set up in Categories (1028 b35ff). This\nsuggests an inadequacy or incompleteness in the account in\nCategories, for there he had seemed to assume that being the\nsubject of predication belonged peculiarly to substance, and also that\na subject is an individual of an appropriate kind\u2014what he calls\na \u2018this such\u2019: and matter is not an individual, but that\nfrom which an individual is made. Two of the criteria of substancehood\npresented in the Introduction above are: (v) being individuals and\nkinds of individual; (vi) being stuffs and kinds of stuff. Aristotle\nacknowledges that things under (vi)\u2014\u2018natural bodies such\nas fire and water and everything of that sort\u2019 (1028\nb10\u201311)\u2014are, or are thought to be, substances. But,\nwithout seeming to give much argument, he strongly favours (v) over\n(vi).\n\nThe elimination of matter as a good candidate for being substance,\nleaves either form alone or the composite of form and matter. The\ncomposite seems more consonant with the doctrine of\nCategories, for the composite is the individual. Aristotle,\nhowever, chooses the form as more paradigmatically substance. This has\npuzzled some commentators. Wiggins (1998: 232ff), for example, thinks\nthat the change in doctrine between Categories and\nMetaphysics is wholly unhelpful. The choice of form as\nsubstance causes perplexity because the form seems to be a universal\nand equivalent to the secondary substance, and so not the most\nfundamental case of substance. But whether substantial forms are\nuniversals in Aristotle is a controversial matter. Interpreters\ndisagree about whether the doghood that is in Fido is best regarded as\nthe universal, or as the particular instance of the universal\ndoghood, other dogs exemplifying numerically different instances of\nthe same universal (for example, Lloyd 1981, Irwin 1988, Woods 1991,\nand Bostock\u2019s commentary to Aristotle 1994). On this view, the\nmost perspicuous way of regarding the individual substance is not as\nthe composite of form and matter (though this is not wrong) but as the\nform individualised in the matter. The matter is still an essential\ncomponent in the substance, but not, so to speak, as an equal partner\nwith the form, but as the catalyst by means of which the form becomes\nan individual substance. It is clear, however, that if one holds that\nAristotle thinks that forms are universals, then forms are not\nsubstance, for, in his attacks on Plato, Aristotle makes it plain that\nuniversals are not substance. Substances for Aristotle are\nindividuals, but it is much debated whether they are individualised\nforms or composites of form and matter.\n\nThere are at least three serious questions about Aristotle\u2019s\nsubstantial forms. One we have already noticed, namely (i) whether\nsuch forms are universals or particulars. The others are (ii) what is\nthe relationship between the substantial form and the properties that\nenter into its definition? We have already noticed this question when\ndiscussing Categories. (iii) What is the ontological status\nof such forms? This is connected with the second question, for it is\nconnected with the question of what the substantial form is over and\nabove the properties essential to it. What I mean by this is as\nfollows. Let us agree, for purposes of argument, that human\nbeing is a kind of substance and that rationality and\nanimality are the properties in terms of which that substance\nis defined. It is uncontroversial that these properties are meant to\nbe objective features of the external world. But what is the relation\nbetween the substantial form and those properties? Is the presence of\nthe substantial form human being nothing more than the\npresence of those properties, or is the form something further that\nis, in some sense responsible for the presence of those\nproperties? We saw in the previous section that the differentia in\nterms of which a substance is defined is not treated as being\n\u2018in\u2019 objects, as other properties are. This seems to\nsuggest that calling an object a substance of a certain sort is not\njust a way of attributing to it the properties in terms of which it is\ndefined. Aristotle is undoubtedly a realist about substantial forms,\nin the sense of thinking them to be something more than a mere\ncollection of properties, but how are we to understand this\n\u2018more\u2019?\n\nIt would be universally agreed by scholars that substantial forms are\nreal in the sense that they play an irreducible and ineliminable\nexplanatory role in the behaviour of the things in which they are the\nform. There are two interpretations of what Aristotle meant by this,\none of which seems compatible with modern science and the other not.\nFirst the compatibilist one. Empiricist philosophers of science used\nto believe that the concepts in higher order sciences could be\nreduced, either by means of reductive definition or by \u2018bridging\nlaws\u2019, to those in the more basic sciences (see, for example,\nNagel 1961). By such means, everything could be understood in terms of\nthe most basic science\u2014presumed to be physics. Concepts in the\nother sciences are thus only a kind of shorthand for laborious\ndescriptions in the language of physics. Few, if any, philosophers of\nscience believe this now. They agree that, even if the world is\n\u2018closed under physics\u2019\u2014every event has a complete\nset of physical causes\u2014the concepts of the other sciences are\nirreducible and do autonomous explanatory jobs. Even if dogs are\nwholly physical objects and even if all the atoms in dogs follow very\nprecise laws of physics, nevertheless when doing the biology of dogs\none will need concepts not to be found in a physics textbook. This is\nnot for mere shorthand convenience, but because of the kinds of things\nin which, for example, the biologist or veterinary scientist is\ninterested. There are interpreters of Aristotle who think that this\nkind of irreducibility is all that Aristotle means\u2014or needs to\nmean\u2014by postulating an explanatory role for substantial form.\nHis theory is at least neutral on the question of whether there is a\nclosed system at the level of basic physics (Nussbaum 1978, 1984).\n\nThe stronger, incompatibilist interpretation is that Aristotle did not\nbelieve that the behaviour of complex entities followed from the laws\nthat govern their parts or their matter (Gotthelf 1987, Robinson\n1983). By contrast, the behaviour of the matter is influenced by what\nit is the matter of. The nature of the matter places restrictions on\nwhat the enmattered thing can do\u2014an animal can only be made from\nliving tissue, not of stone or fire\u2014but exactly how that matter\nbehaves depends on the substantial form present in it. The substantial\nform plays, therefore, an essential role, not merely in certain kinds\nof scientific explanation, but by being a fundamental efficient cause\nin its own right. Whichever of these is the correct interpretation of\nAristotle, it was the second that was the core of \u2018Aristotelian\nscience\u2019 as found in scholastic philosophy, and it was this\naspect of the Aristotelian doctrine of substance that aroused most\nopposition amongst seventeenth century philosophers and scientists.\nThey insisted that bodies behave as they do because of the mechanical\nconsequences of the nature of the matter from which they are made: the\nmatter is not \u2018pushed around\u2019 or organised by a\nsubstantial form. Philosophers and scientists of the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries believed that in rejecting such influences they\nwere rejecting the Aristotelian doctrine of substance.\n\nFinally, let us consider how Aristotle fares according to the criteria\nof substance with which we ended the introduction. Aristotelian\nsubstance, whether construed as individualised form or composite of\nform and matter meets (i), the criterion of ontological basicness. It\nalso meets (ii), relative durability, although in a rather modest\nmanner. Individual substances are more durable than instances of the\nproperties in the other categories, for it is substances that can take\non and lose those other properties. Individuals are not, however, very\nlong-lived and on this criterion Aristotle makes what could be\nregarded as a concession to Plato, for it is form as universal, which\nAristotle does not consider properly substance, that is most durable.\nThere are at least two senses in which substantial forms are eternal.\nFirst, Aristotle believes the world to be eternal and all the same\nspecies to exist eternally. So that, even though particular objects\nare subject to degeneration and decay, the species as such are\neternal. Second, generation and decay depend on the material component\nin composites. Any form that does not require matter for its activity\nwill be eternal by nature. This applies to the active intellect, which\nis an essential feature of all human intellects, and to the immaterial\nmovers of the cosmos described in Metaphysics, Book Lambda.\n(Further consideration of these topics would take us into\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy of mind and his theology.)\n\nAs we have seen, substances are the paradigm subjects of predication\nand change, so (iii) and (iv) are met. As Aristotle\u2019s substances\nare individual things and kinds of things (v) is met. A nod is made in\nthe direction of stuffs and kinds of stuff, but Aristotle does not\ndevelop this thought, so (vi) is barely met.\n\nThere are two major problems that the Aristotelian tradition has faced\nin the modern period. They are: (1) explaining and justifying the\nsense in which substantial forms have causal or explanatory power,\nespecially in light of a developed mechanistic chemistry or physics;\n(2) the difficulty in understanding the relation of substantial form\nto properties, especially those in terms of which a given substance is\ndefined. These are connected. It is because the substantial form has\ngenuine causal force that it is conceived of by Aristotle as a unified\nentity in its own right, and not just as a name for the collocation of\nproperties in terms of which it is defined.\n\n(One subject that has not been discussed is the connection between the\ndoctrine of substance and teleology. Aristotle regards this relation\nas important, but in this entry it will have a section of its own,\n 3.5\n below.)\n2.3 Medieval accounts of substance\n\nThe standard account of the medieval treatment of the topic is that S.\nThomas Aquinas is the only important figure and what he says differs\nlittle from Aristotle, except for making things more rigid and formal.\nIt is clear, however, that this is a serious oversimplification. For a\nmore nuanced and sophisticated view, see Lagerlund (2012), on which\nthis section draws extensively.\n\nOur discussion of Aristotle ended by returning to the issue of the\nunity of substantial form\u2014what is the difference between a\ncollection of \u2018essential\u2019 properties and the form as a\nunitary entity. Various aspects of this issue of the unity of\nsubstantial form preoccupied medieval philosophers. According to\nAquinas, a substance possessed only one form, and its matter was the\nessentially characterless prime matter. In other words the informed\nparts of an object\u2014in the case of a living creature, its organs,\nand the various kinds of stuff that constituted it (in the end,\nquantities of earth, fire, air, and water) did not possess their own\nforms, but were informed by the overall substantial form. Others\ndisagreed. Some of the disagreements were internal to the hylomorphic\nsystem. Duns Scotus, for example, argued that a dead person\u2019s\nbody was the same body as had existed when that person was alive. The\nsoul had departed, so the form that was the immortal soul could not be\nidentical with the form of the body. This argument may seem to be\nspecialised to the case of the human immortal soul, but, presumably, a\nsimilar problem applies to a dead parrot: it has lost its perceptive\nand vegetative souls, yet is the same body\u2014even if it is no\nlonger a parrot.\n\nThis line of thought proved to be a slippery slope, and, as so often,\nthe downward slide was led by William of Ockham. On the one hand,\nOckham was committed to hylomorphism, in that a substance is composed\nof form and matter. But he reverses the priorities of Aquinas and\nScotus by saying that the parts are actual in their own right and do\nnot derive their actuality from the whole: rather, the whole is\nnothing but the sum of its parts. This line of thought opened the way\nto atomism and to treating the unity of wholes as a matter of\nconvention or degree. Buridan, who represents a further development in\nthis direction, says\n\nIn this sense, I am not the same as I was yesterday, because something\nwas part of my integrity yesterday, which has already been used up,\nand something was not part of my integrity, which has meanwhile been\nadded by nourishment. (Buridan, Physics I,q.10, f. xiii;\ncited Lagerlund 2012: 476)\n\n\nIt is clear that this way of thinking paves the way for atomism and\nits associated problems as they emerged in early modern\nphilosophy.\n2.4 Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz\n\nThe concept of substance figures centrally in a positive way for the\nrationalist philosophers, in a way that it does not for the\nempiricists. The rationalists\u2019 substances are not, however, the\nindividual objects of everyday life.\n\nDescartes believed in only two kinds of substance: material body,\nwhich is defined by extension, and mental substance, which is defined\nby thought, which, in this context, is more or less equivalent to\nconsciousness. Descartes (like Aristotle and unlike most of his\ncontemporaries and immediate successors) was not an atomist. He did\nnot believe in a void between bodies, so there is a sense in which\nthere is just one material substance, numerically as well as\nspecifically. For Descartes, therefore, material substance falls more\nnaturally into the stuff category, rather than into the\nthing category. The situation is different for mental\nsubstance. The cogito shows that Descartes definitely\nbelieves that each person is a different individual mental\nsubstance.\n\nDescartes, like the atomists, believed that matter operates in an\nentirely mechanical way. There is, therefore, no causal role for\nsubstantial form to play and, hence, no need for such forms. His two\nsubstances are each defined in terms of one property (extension for\nmatter and thought for mind), hence there is no problem about the\nrelation between substance and the properties in terms of which it is\ndefined. As he does not have substances as individuals made of kinds\nof stuff, there is no conflict between individuals and stuffs.\n\nFor Spinoza, there is only one substance, the existence of which is\ndemonstrated by a version of the ontological argument, that is thought\nof as being both God and Nature. It is an unending controversy whether\nSpinoza was a pantheist, or an atheist who called nature\n\u2018God\u2019 because it was the one true substance and existed\nnecessarily. Everything else is a mode of this one substance. The view\nis analogous to a claim that the universe is space-time as a whole,\nwith matter as distortions in it. If this were true, material objects\nwould be modes of space-time. The analogy would be more exact if one\nalso thought of the laws of nature as equivalent to the divine\nintellect immanent in nature. Spinoza\u2019s view represents the\nextreme end of stressing the status of substance as the fundamental\nexistent conceived of as wholly necessary and self-subsistent: that\nis, criteria (i) and (ii) in the original list come to take on maximum\nweight. Nothing but the universe as a whole meets this criterion\nfully.\n\nLeibniz was not satisfied by this conception of divine substance, at\nleast in part because it confines God to what actually exists. For\nLeibniz, God contains within himself all possibilities, not just the\nactual world: this latter is just that maximal set of possibilities\nthat he has best reason to actualise. Leibniz acknowledges created\nsubstances, though they are very intimately dependent on God. In the\nDiscourse on Metaphysics (Section 14), he says:\n\nit is clear that created substances depend on God, who conserves them\nand indeed who produces them continuously by a kind of emanation, just\nas we produce our thoughts. (1998: 66)\n\n\nThe analogy with thought hardly emphasises the independence of\nsubstance! Nevertheless, created substances do constitute the created\nworld, and do, in that sense, meet criterion (i) for being substance.\nThey are also the subjects of predication, so they meet criterion\n(iii). Leibniz\u2019s substances, however, are the bearers of change\n(criterion (iv)) in a very different way from Aristotle\u2019s\nindividual substances. An Aristotelian individual possesses some\nproperties essentially and some accidentally. The accidental\nproperties of an object are ones that can be gained and lost over\ntime, and which it might never have possessed at all: its essential\nproperties are the only ones it had to possess and which it possesses\nthroughout its existence. The situation is different for\nLeibniz\u2019s monads\u2014which is the name he gives to\nindividual substances, created or uncreated (so God is a monad).\nWhereas, for Aristotle, the properties that an object has to\npossess and those that it possesses throughout its existence\ncoincide, they do not do so for Leibniz. That is, for Leibniz, even\nthe properties that an object possesses only for a part of its\nexistence are essential to it. Every monad bears each of its\nproperties as part of its nature, so if it were to have been different\nin any respect, it would have been a different entity.\n\nFurthermore, there is a sense in which all monads are exactly similar\nto each other, for they all reflect the whole world. They each do so,\nhowever, from a different perspective.\n\nFor God, so to speak, turns on all sides and considers in all ways the\ngeneral system of phenomena which he has found it good to\nproduce\u2026And he considers all the faces of the world in all\npossible ways\u2026the result of each view of the universe, as\nlooked at from a certain position, is\u2026a substance which\nexpresses the universe in conformity with that view. (1998: 66)\n\n\nSo each monad reflects the whole system, but with its own perspective\nemphasised. If a monad is at place p at time t, it will contain all\nthe features of the universe at all times, but with those relating to\nits own time and place most vividly, and others fading out roughly in\naccordance with temporal and spatial distance. Because there is a\ncontinuum of perspectives on reality, there is an infinite number of\nthese substances. Nevertheless, there is internal change in the\nmonads, because the respect in which its content is vivid varies with\ntime and with action. Indeed, the passage of time just is the change\nin which of the monad\u2019s contents are most vivid.\n\nIt is not possible to investigate here Leibniz\u2019s reasons for\nthese apparently very strange views. Our present concern is with\nwhether, and in what sense, Leibniz\u2019s substances are subjects of\nchange. One can say that, in so far as, at all times, they reflect the\nwhole of reality, then they do not change. But in so far as they\nreflect some parts of that reality more vividly than others, depending\non their position in space and time, they can be said to change.\n2.5 Locke\n\nAccording to Locke, we have two conceptions of substance. One is a\n\u2018notion of pure substance in general\u2019\n(Essay II xxiii 2), the other \u2018ideas of particular\nsorts of substance\u2019 (II xxiii 3). Both these conceptions of\nsubstance provide difficulties of interpretation. They also both\nrelate to issues in contemporary philosophy of substance, in which\nLocke\u2019s influence is almost as important as\nAristotle\u2019s.\n2.5.1 Locke on \u2018pure substance in general\u2019\n\nLocke expresses this idea as follows:\n\nThe idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance,\nbeing nothing, but the supposed, but unknown support of those\nqualities, we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist, sine\nre substante, without something to support them, we call that\nsupport substantia, which, according to the true import of\nthe word, is in plain English, standing under or\nupholding. (II xxiii 2)\n\n\nThe traditional rationale of Locke\u2019s doctrine of\n\u2018substance in general\u2019 is as follows. Properties\u2014or,\nin Locke\u2019s terms qualities\u2014must belong to\nsomething\u2014\u2018cannot subsist\u2026without something to\nsupport them\u2019. Of course, they belong to objects, but what are\nobjects over and above their properties? The special category of\nsubstantial form, as found in Aristotle, is rejected. All that seems\nto be left is a bare \u2018something\u2019, which on pain of\nregress, has no properties in its own right, except the property of\nbeing the owner or support of other properties.\n\nThis interpretation of Locke\u2019s notion of \u2018substance in\ngeneral\u2019 is, however, a matter of controversy. It is contested\nwhether Locke actually believed in substance as a characterless\nsubstratum. Although the first quotation above seems to affirm it,\nLocke also in the same section speaks disparagingly about the idea,\ncomparing it to the notion that the world rests on an elephant, which\nrests on a tortoise, and so on: in other words, as not constituting a\nreal explanation at all. Michael Ayers (1975, 1991b: 39\u201350)\nbelieves that the only substratum that Locke acknowledges is the\nunknown\u2014and, Locke thinks, unknowable by us\u2014structure of\nthe minute parts. This is what he elsewhere characterises as the\nreal essence. It is clear from the text that Locke is at\nleast uneasy with the idea of \u2018pure substance in general\u2019,\nbut it is less clear whether he feels obliged to accept an idea he\ndislikes, or whether he rejects it. (For the view that he accepts it,\nand why, see Bennett 1971 and 1987.)\n\nThere are indications that Locke is confused about what he means by\n\u2018substratum\u2019. He argues that the notion of spiritual\nsubstance is in no worse a predicament than material substance,\nbecause\n\nwe have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit as we have of\nbody: the one being supposed to be (without knowing what it is)\nthe substratum to those simple ideas we have from without;\nand the other supposed (with a like ignorance of what it is) to be the\nsubstratum to those operations which we experiment in\nourselves within. \u2018Tis plain then, that the idea of corporeal\nsubstance in matter, is as remote from our conceptions, and\napprehensions, as that of spiritual substance, or\nspirit;\u2026. (II 23 v)\n\n\nThis argument seems to conflate the notions of substratum as\npure logical support with that as minute parts. If he means minute\nparts, then, though it is true that we do not and, in his view, cannot\nknow in detail what they are, we have a theory, which he endorses,\nthat they are probably minute parts as conceived by the atomists,\nwhich means they have primary qualities similar in kind though not in\nscale to those possessed by macroscopic objects. This gives a\ncoherent, though speculative, conception of material substance. Of\nspiritual substance, we have no similar hypothesis. If, on the other\nhand, he means pure logical substratum, there is nothing to know, for\nthere is no more to it, in either the material or spiritual case, than\nits role as substratum. He seems to conflate the ignorance we have of\nminute parts with the logical emptiness of the idea of pure\nsubstratum.\n\nIn fact there are three issues concerning the material underpinning of\nthings that Locke regards as mysterious, and he seems to move\nindifferently from one to the other. First, there is organisation of\nthe minute parts of particular kinds of objects, which is responsible\nfor the manifest properties of those objects, and which he thinks will\nalways fall beyond our knowledge. Second is the mystery of what holds\nthe minute parts together: the problem of explaining attraction in a\nsystem that only understands influence by impact (xxiii 23). Third, is\nthat idea of substance as a bare substratum, which is \u201ca\nsupposed, I know not what, to support those ideas we call\naccidents\u201d (xxiii 15).\n\nPerhaps it is more profitable to ask whether, in his own terms, Locke\nought to have accepted bare substratum. If we accept that the\nquestion of what binds together the qualities of a macroscopic object\ncan be answered by appeal to the minute parts, the issue would then be\nwhat binds the primary qualities of atoms. Do the size, shape, mass,\nsolidity of a particular atom require a bare substratum to inhere in\nfor them to constitute a coherent object? Would they, without such a\nsubstratum be just a stack of qualities, a house of cards with nothing\nholding them together? There does not seem to be anywhere in the text\nwhere Locke discusses this problem\u2014that is, the coherence of\natoms as opposed to composite objects\u2014explicitly. One possible\nresort is to treat solidity as the core or master quality and all the\nothers as features of it. One would never ask what binds together a\npatch of colour and its shape, because the shape is the shape\nof the colour patch, and, though the shape of something can\nchange, its shape cannot come away from it, like a separable\ncomponent. Perhaps the shape, size and density of an atom are\nsimilarly features of the solidity. The quality solidity would then\nbecome equivalent to the notion of material stuff or material\nsubstance and Locke shows no sign of wanting to elide the ideas of\nquality and substance in this way, though it should be noted that this\nis what Descartes does with extension. Because he does not believe in\nvoid, extension carries with it the other basic properties of matter\nas features of it.\n2.5.2 Locke on \u2018ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2019\n\nThe ideas of particular sorts of substance\u2014called\nsortals\u2014are formed\n\nby collecting such combinations of simple ideas, as are by experience\nand observation of men\u2019s senses, taken notice of to exist\ntogether, and are therefore supposed to flow from the particular\ninternal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance. Thus we\ncome to have the ideas of a man, horse, gold, water,\netc\u2026 (II xxiii 3)\n\n\nThus, for Locke, the real essence is an unknown atomic constitution.\nThe types that we categorise them in depend on the properties we\nhappen to be able to perceive and kinds or sorts are defined in terms\nof these observable properties. Definition in these terms he calls\n\u2018nominal essence\u2019. Our concepts of natural substances\npresuppose that the nominal essence hides a real essence\u2014that\nis, that all water, gold, horses etc are in some way similar at a\nmicroscopic level. But he both denies that these real essences play\nany role in the formation of our concepts and is deeply sceptical of\nour ever being able to discover what they are. His attitude towards\nthe Aristotelian view is expressed later in the paragraph just\nquoted:\n\n\u2026a philosopher\u2026whatever substantial forms he may talk\nof, has no other idea of those substances than what is framed by a\ncollection of those simple ideas which are found in them\u2026.\n\n\nLocke\u2019s doctrine of sortals is in some respects realist and in\nsome conceptualist or conventionalist. It is realist in at least the\nfollowing ways.\n\nThe properties [ideas] in terms of which sortals are defined do\ncorrespond to real qualities and powers in the world. There is no\nsense in which these building blocks of reality are creatures of our\nconceptual scheme.\nThe properties invoked by nominal essences are \u201csupposed to\nflow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of\nthat substance\u201d(xxiii 3). This internal constitution\n\u201cmakes the whole subsist by itself\u201d (xxiii 6).\n\n\nThus Locke is entirely realist about individual bodies and their\nproperties. He is more conventionalist, however, about their\nclassification under particular sortals. There are four ways in which\nhe is a conceptualist about particular substances, as we classify\nthem.\n\nThere is nothing over and above the properties of an object\ncorresponding to our substance concepts\u2014nothing, that is, like a\nsubstantial form\u2014present in the world. Sortals are entirely\nformed by our minds, in the light of the properties perceived to be in\nthe world.\nThe boundaries we draw between kinds of things are, to some degree\nat least, arbitrary and concept relative.\n\n\nI do not deny, but nature, in the constant production of particular\nbeings, makes them\u2026 very much alike and of kin one to another:\nbut I think it nevertheless true, that the boundaries of the\nspecies, whereby men sort them, are made by men\u2026. (III vi\n37: italics in original)\n \nThe situation in (ii) is greatly aggravated by our ignorance of\nreal essences. If we could know those more accurately, we would know\nbetter where to draw the boundaries.\nThe disposition of properties in nature need not have been as it\nis and might actually contain oddities not corresponding to any of our\nsortals. Sortals, unlike Aristotelian species, place no constraints on\nhow individual objects must or ought to be.\n\n\nLocke\u2019s contribution is, therefore, three-fold. He brings to\ncentre stage the question of whether properties require some\nsubstratum or bare particular to inhere in or belong to. He asserts\nthat the substantial nature of the physical world is the unknown\nstructure of atomic parts, not a substantial form which reflects our\nusual concepts. Third, he develops a theory of substance which is\nrealist about particular objects and their properties, but\nconceptualist or conventionalist about our classifications, within the\nconstraints that the facts about particulars and properties\nimpose.\n\nThere is one important context, however, where Locke does not appear\nto talk in a conventionalist way about sortal identity, but in a way\nthat seems to be reminiscent of substantial forms. This is when he is\ndiscussing the individuation of living things. He understands ordinary\nbodies as mereological sums of atoms. As such, any change of particle\nconstitutes a new object, for a mereological sum is individuated by\nits parts and a change of parts means a change of the object\nconstituted by those parts. Treating ordinary, non-living, bodies as\ncomplex enduring objects is a matter of convention determined by the\nconcepts we happen to possess. Living things, however, have a deeper\nprinciple of unity.\n\nThat being then one plant which has such an organization of parts in\none coherent body, partaking of one common life, it continues to be\nthe same plant as long as it partakes of the same life, though that\nlife be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to the\nliving plant\u2026. (Essay II.27.4)\n\n\nOne might wonder what this \u2018common life\u2019 is supposed to\nbe, especially in the light of his rejection of Aristotelian\n\u2018substantial forms\u2019. Furthermore, it is tempting to argue\nthat all coherent, solid bodies\u2014such as a lump of rock or\nplasticene\u2014have some principle of organisation that persists\nthrough change. Living objects are simply the most dramatic case of\nthis. (Though Peter van Inwagen (1990) defends the view that only\nliving things and atoms are real entities: inanimate complex bodies\nare not true individuals.) Nevertheless, though the appeal to\n\u2018life\u2019 seems to modify Locke\u2019s conventionalism, it\nstill leaves open the possibility that the divisions we make between\ndifferent species are conventions, because, though we can recognise\nlife (or a \u2018continuing principle of organisation\u2019) itself,\nit is still relatively arbitrary and concept-dependent where life (or\n\u2018principle of organisation\u2019) of one kind ends and another\nstarts. So our division of things into species, though grounded in\nreal continuities in the way that our non-biological (or non-natural)\nconcepts are not, is still nominal.\n\nAs we shall see, the idea that there is a real unity that is passed on\nthrough the life of an object or through any principle of organisation\nis something that Hume criticises and rejects.\n\nThe potential for a stronger realism in Locke has been exploited by\nPutnam and Kripke in their development of a modern, essentialist\nconception of natural kind terms. Locke was pessimistic in two\nconnected respects. First he was sceptical about the possibility of\nscience discovering the nature of the real essences\u2014the\nstructures of atoms or molecules\u2014that underlie kinds of\nsubstance picked out by our ordinary sortals. Second, he doubted\nwhether the objects picked out by our actual substance concepts really\nshared a real essence in the way we assume that they do. He was not\nconfident, that is, that everything we call gold, or iron, or a\nmonkey, was actually interestingly similar at a non-superficial level.\nBoth these forms of pessimism proved largely unfounded. The\nconsequence of this is the possibility of bringing together real\nessence and the sortal concepts originally picked out by a nominal\nessence. We now know water to be H2O and iron to be the\nelement of atomic weight 56. Our substance concepts were, often at\nleast, tracking real essences in the world. This involves\nreinterpreting the rationale of our substance concepts. Locke thought\nthat our concept of gold was properly expressed as \u2018anything\ngold in colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia\u2019. He thought\nthat we add the optimistic assumption that there will be similarity at\nthe microscopic level. What many philosophers, under Putnam\u2019s\ninfluence, now think he should have said is that gold is that kind\nof thing which is individuated by a particular kind of minute\nstructure that underlies the stuff that is gold in colour,\nmalleable, soluble in aqua regia. In other words, our confidence that\nthese kinds have a genuine real essence is built into the concept. If\nthis is correct, then our ordinary \u2018natural kind\u2019\nconcepts, like water and gold, have built into them\nintimations of a deeper unity than that supplied by superficial\nfeatures, even if it be allied to a complete agnosticism about what\nthat unity might consist in or whether we might ever uncover it.\n\nHow does Locke, then, rate against the six criteria for substancehood\nthat were set up in the introduction? Accepting, for these purposes,\nthat Locke believed in substratum, we can apply these tests both to\nsubstratum, and to his \u2018ideas of particular sorts of\nsubstance\u2019.\n\nFirst, consider substratum. (i) Ontological basicness. There is a\nsense in which it is ontologically basic, but it is a rather empty\nsense: it is the substancehood of everything, without\nexplaining the nature of anything. (ii) Durability. Again, it meets\nthe criterion, but in an empty way. It is difficult to see how it\ncould be destroyed (like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter) but it has no\npositive nature. (iii) and (iv) Bearer of predication and subject of\nchange. As with matter for Aristotle, it meets the first of these\nstandards well, but, in so far as it is a component only in atoms, it\nis not the subject of change. (v) and (vi) Kinds of individuals and\nstuffs. Although in everything, it is itself no kind of thing and\ntherefore no kind of individual or stuff. Substratum\u2019s claim to\nsubstancehood does not rest, however, on meeting the tests itself, but\non being what enables particular kinds of substances to be\nsubstances. According to the believer in substratum, it is in virtue\nof their inhering in a substratum that a collection of properties can\nconstitute an enduring, change-sustaining thing of a certain kind.\nWithout that support, individual instances of properties could, if\nthey could exist at all, be no more than ephemeral events.\n\nWe have seen that Locke\u2019s particular substances are\nkinds of things, and because they are kinds they correspond\nto Aristotle\u2019s secondary substances. But we have also\nseen that the boundaries between these kinds are largely a matter of\nconvention, which is not true of Aristotle\u2019s secondary\nsubstances. In so far as their individuation is dependent on human\nconvention, they are not ultimately real in their own right. But\nthough they are not real as kinds, the individual parcels of matter\nthat we classify in these ways are perfectly real. Locke does not, as\nfar as I can see, refer to these individuals as\n\u2018substances\u2019. Substances, considered as kinds, or\ninstances of kinds, can sustain change\u2014living things, for\nexample, change in size throughout their lives. Most individual\nparcels of matter, however, become different individuals if they\nchange any of their parts; although we have seen that this does not\napply to living things, where there seems to be a metaphysical\ncomponent called sameness of life.\n\nIn general, Locke\u2019s particular substances are not ontologically\nbasic, because their essences are nominal, though this is not so\nclearly true for sortals naming biological kinds. Locke\u2019s\nconceptualism about such substances makes most of the tests\nirrelevant, which are cast within a realist framework. Locke\u2019s\n\u2018particular substances\u2019 are kinds that are individuated\nconventionally, and so are not real substantial kinds, by Aristotelian\nstandards. But Locke is not without substance other than substratum,\nfor his real essence\u2014that is, the atoms and their\nstructures\u2014are his real substances, and what we say above about\nthe substantiality of atoms also goes for Locke.\n2.6 Hume and Kant on substance\n\nIt is plausible to maintain the general thesis that there are many\nissues on which Hume was a sceptic or nihilist, but where his legacy\nis more reductionist than sceptical or nihilist. This general thesis\ncan be explained and illustrated by considering his treatment of\nsubstance, for it is a case in question.\n\nAccording to Hume, in the Treatise, our belief in substance\nis the result of a mistake or illusion.\n\nWhen we gradually follow an object in its successive changes, the\nsmooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity to the\nsuccession\u2026When we compare its situation after a considerable\nchange the progress of the thought is broken; and consequently we are\npresented with the idea of diversity: In order to reconcile which\ncontradictions, the imagination is apt to feign something unknown and\ninvisible, which it supposes to continue the same under all these\nvariations; and this unintelligible something it calls a\nsubstance, or original and first matter. (1978: 220)\n\n\nHume\u2019s target is any account that postulates a unifying\n\u2018something\u2019 that underlies change, whether this be a\ncharacterless substratum, a substantial form or (though this is not\nexplicitly mentioned) something like the \u2018continuing life\u2019\nthat Locke sees as passed on in living things. The crucial point is\nthat a succession of very similar things does not constitute the real\ncontinuation of anything, only the illusion of real continuation.\n\nThus Hume\u2019s treatment of substance is like his treatment of\ncausation, in that he sees both as the projection onto the world of a\ntendency of our minds either to pass from one thing to another or to\nassociate them in some way. He either doubts that there are such\nthings as substance or causation (scepticism) or even positively\ndenies that there are (nihilism). Out of Hume\u2019s very forthright\nnegative attitude there developed two more subtle variants. One of\nthese variants is in the empiricist tradition. That tradition modified\nHume\u2019s approach by developing it into a form of reductionism.\nThe experiences that gave rise, through habit, to the mistaken belief\n(in, for example, substance or causation) are presented as what the\nbelief really affirms. That is, the empirical basis for what Hume\ndeems to be an illusion, is reinterpreted as the reductive account of\nthe concept. Causation then becomes constant conjunction, or substance\na name for a bundle of properties organised in a certain way or the\ncontinuing of the possibility of certain sensations.\n\nKant developed the other variant. He took Hume\u2019s\n\u2018tendencies of the mind to pass\u2019 from one idea to another,\nwithout which we could not construct the world, and canonised them as\na priori categories of the understanding. Hume\u2019s empiricist\nemphasis is psychological. It concerns what we are habituated to do.\nBecause of his empiricism, he will not bring non-psychological\nnecessity into it. Nevertheless, there is the implication that making\nthese transitions is the only way in which one can understand\nthe world. Kant drops the empirical psychology and makes it a matter\nof a priori psychology, that only by employing certain categories\ncould we have experience as of a physical world. It is only by\nunderstanding the world as possessing enduring spatio-temporal\nobjects, which enter into causal relations with each other (that is,\nit is only by applying the categories of substance and causation) that\nwe can have intelligible experience. Substances\u2014that is, a\nframework of stable, enduring objects\u2014are essential, but the\nsource of this necessity lies not in how the world is in itself, but\nin the framework that we are obliged to impose.\n\nIn the Kantian philosophy of P. F. Strawson (1959, 1966), this\nframework of necessity is taken in a more common-sense and realist\nspirit. The world must possess such enduring objects for it to be\nintelligible for us\u2014indeed, for us to be part of it, for we are\nessentially stable bodies amongst other stable bodies. The important\npoint for both Strawson and Kant is that there must be substances for\nthere to be a coherent empirical, spatio-temporal world.\nSubstance has become a formal concept of central\nimportance\u2014that is a concept with a special central role in the\nstructure of our conceptual scheme\u2014rather than being the name\nfor certain kinds of important things in the world. This distinction,\nhowever, is one that has to be handled carefully, especially within a\nrealist Kantian framework, such as Strawson provides. This should\nbecome clear below when we discuss Wiggins\u2019s theory, which is\nboth Aristotelian and Strawsonian. Nevertheless, it gives ground for\nadding the seventh of the marks of substance mentioned in the\nIntroduction, namely that substances are those enduring particulars\nthat give unity to our spatio-temporal framework and individuation and\nre-identification of which enables us to locate ourselves in that\nframework.\n3. Contemporary Controversies\n\nTwo major areas of controversy require attention. First, there are the\nissues concerning how to characterise substance in contradistinction\nto properties and the other categories. There are at least two major\nquestions here. One concerns defining the notion of substance. In\nparticular, there has been much debate about whether substance can be\naccounted for in terms of its special kind of independence.\nThe other is whether substancehood requires some extra component\nbeyond properties, (and, if so, what?) or whether a \u2018bundle of\nproperties\u2019 theory of substance is adequate. Second there is the\nrelation between substances and our practices of individuation and\nreidentification. In particular, we shall look at the issue of whether\nobjects must be individuated under the kind of sortal expressions that\ncorrespond to Aristotelian substance concepts, or whether a more\ngeneric notion, such as physical body, will suffice. This\nlatter concern will lead on to a consideration of the connection\nbetween substance and teleology.\n3.1. How substances are distinguished from things in other categories\n\nOne natural response to the question of what distinguishes substances\nfrom properties is that properties depend for their existence on\nsubstances, for they are properties of objects (that is, of\nindividual substances), but that substances do not similarly depend on\nproperties for their existence. The point cannot be made quite so\nsimply, however. Properties could not exist without objects to be\nproperties of, but neither could substances exist without properties,\nso the dependence appears to be mutual.\n\nThis problem can be overcome by more careful expression of the point,\nmaking it clear that we are not talking about properties in general\nand substances in general, but about particular instances or cases of\na property and the particular objects to which they belong. A\nparticular property instance cannot exist and could not have existed\nwithout the substance of which it is a property, but the particular\nsubstance can exist and could have existed without that property\ninstance. Thus, a particular instance of colour cannot exist, and\ncould not have existed, without the object of which it is the colour,\nbut the object can exist without the colour instance, for it may\nchange colour and remain the same object, or it could have had a\ndifferent colour from the start.\n\nVarious problems can be raised for this account. The most obvious is\nthat it does not, as stated, distinguish between substances and\nevents. Some property-instances belong to events rather than\nsubstances. The performance of a symphony, for example, is an event,\nand it may possess the property, in one of its movements, of being\nallegro. It seems plausible that this particular case of\nsomething\u2019s being allegro could not have been exemplified by\nanother performance, but the performance might go on to be andante in\nanother movement, so the event can continue to exist without that\noriginal property. The assimilation of events with substances in this\nway seems strained, however. It does not seem natural to say that the\nsame event was first allegro, then andante, because it is more natural\nto attribute the different properties to different parts of the event,\nwhich are themselves events (in this case, movements). This\nbrings out a major difference between substances and events, namely\nthat the temporal parts of events are themselves events in their own\nright, but the temporal parts of objects\u2014meaning by that\nexpression the temporal phases of an object\u2019s\nexistence\u2014are not themselves objects. Indeed, it is not natural\nto talk of the temporal parts of objects, though some philosophers\n(led by David Lewis (1986), but see also Sider (2001), Hawley (2001)\nand the entry on\n temporal parts)\n think that there are compelling philosophical reasons for doing so.\nThe rationale implicit in our ordinary concept is that an object is\nwholly present at all the temporal points of its existence. I say\n\u2018implicit rationale\u2019, because it seems no more natural to\nspeak of an object as being \u2018wholly present at all temporal\npoints of its existence\u2019 than it is to say that it has objects\nas its temporal parts. Nevertheless, one does not think of a\nlong-lived object as consisting of a series of short-lived objects\nstacked end to end, but one does think it natural to think of a\ndrawn-out event as consisting of a series of shorter events. If it is\nnot natural to think of objects as having objects as their temporal\nparts, this seems to commit one to thinking of objects as wholly\npresent at all times of their existence, strange though this form of\nexpression may also be.\n\nThe difference between substances, events and properties can now be\nexpressed as follows. Substances and events are distinguished from\nproperties by the fact that properties are the kinds of things the\ninstances of which depend for their existence on the particular\nsubstance or event by which they are instantiated, whereas substances\nand events are such as not to depend for their existence on particular\ninstances of properties. And substances are distinguished from events\nin the following way: events are those property-instantiators that,\nwhen they exist through time, are temporally composed of further\nthings of the same category (i.e., events): substances are those\nproperty-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are not\ntemporally composed of things of the same category (i.e., of\nsubstances) but endure singly through the period.\n\nLowe, in his (1998), which contains a very thorough discussion of all\nthe topics discussed in this section, defends an\n\u2018independence\u2019 account of substance, which he states in\nterms of identity, as follows:\n\nx is a substance if and only if x is a particular\nand there is no particular y such that y is not\nidentical to x and the identity of x depends on the\nidentity of y.\n\n\nHe considers two objections to his own account which would seem to\napply to all independence accounts. One is that it cannot\ncope with essential properties, for it seems to imply that, for any\ngiven property-instance, a substance can exist without it, which is\nnot true of essential properties. The other is that it cannot cope\nwith the necessity of origin for individual identity.\n\nLowe responds to the former objection by saying that essential\nproperties are identical with the substance, so cannot be cited as\nsomething other than substance that meets his criterion for being\nsubstance. It is not clear that this will work. The idea that the\nessence is identical with the substance is Aristotelian, but\nit is not clear how this applies to essential properties, taken\nindividually. We have already seen, in our discussion of Aristotle,\nthat the relation between the essence as some kind of unity and the\nproperties that seem to constitute it is not clear. He copes with the\nsecond by denying that origin is essential to identity. Unfortunately,\nhe argues for this position by citing human subjects: Socrates, for\nexample, would still have been who he was even if he had had different\nparents. This is, of course, controversial about humans, but it is our\nCartesian intuitions that make it plausible in that case. That this\ntable, for example, could have been the same object even if made from\ndifferent material does not have the same plausibility. \n\nWhether these objections to the above versions of the\nindependence account can be answered is unclear. Hoffman and\nRosenkrantz (1994 and 1997) develop a different, though probably not\nincompatible, conception of the relative independence of substances\ncompared to other categories. Substance, they say, is the only\ncategory of thing that might have only one instance through at least a\nminimally extended period of time. Thus, for example, there is no\npossible world that has, in a given period of time, only one event,\nfor any non-instantaneous event will be made of events that are its\nparts. Similarly for properties or tropes, there can never be only one\nbecause any one entails the existence of others, as, for example, the\nexistence of a red property (instance) entails the existence of (an\ninstance of) the property colour. By contrast, there could exist\nthrough a period of time just one substance, provided that it was\natomic.\n\nAs Mackie (2000) points out, the full statement of this theory\ninvolves various relatively ad hoc restrictions. More importantly, it\ndoes not seem to explain what unifies the category of substance, for\nit does not say that it is true of any substance that it could\nconceivably be the only substance existing for a period of\ntime\u2014indeed, it could not apply to non-atomic substances, for\ncomplex ones can exist only if other substances\u2014those that\nconstitute their parts\u2014also exist. It implies only that\nsomething from the category of substance might so exist and\nthat this could not be true of any other category. One might wonder\nwhat enabled substances that could not exist alone to count as\nsubstances at all.\n\nIf either of the above accounts are successful, substances, properties\nand events are distinguished. The question remains, however, how far\nthese are nominal and how far real distinctions. That there is a\ndifference between substance concepts and property concepts has\ndefinitely been shown, but does it follow that there are, in reality\ntwo different kinds of thing, namely properties and\nsubstances? The answer might seem to be obvious. Given that there are\nsubstance concepts, if those concepts are instantiated, then there are\nsubstances in reality. Cat, table, human\nbeing, are substance concepts by the above accounts, and there\nare cats, tables and humans, so there are substances in reality as\nwell as properties.\n\nThe matter is not so simple, however. It is possible, and not\nuncommon, for concepts of a certain kind to be exemplified, but for it\nto be the case that, nevertheless, entities answering directly to\nthose concepts are not included in the most economical statement of\none\u2019s ontology. This is reductionism, and it can operate in\neither of two ways, namely either analytical reductionism or what one\nmight call de facto or \u2018nothing but\u2019 reductionism. In the\npresent case, it would conform to the analytical option if the concept\nof substance could be analysed in terms of properties or events (e.g.,\n\u2018to be a substance =df to be a collection of properties bound\ntogether in way W\u2019). But one might still hold that, though the\nconcept of substance is not precisely analysable and is indispensable,\nsubstances in fact are nothing but collections of properties.\nThis latter is the de facto option. So the existence of substances\ndoes not show that the concept is important from a philosophical\nperspective, or, if it has some significance, whether this is just as\na necessary part of our conceptual scheme, or as an ineliminable\nfeature of reality itself.\n3.2 Bundle theories versus substratum and \u2018thin particulars\u2019\n3.2.1 Bundle theories and their problems\n\nWe have just noted that there could be analytically reductionist or de\nfacto reductionist accounts of substance in terms of properties. It is\nalso the case that the properties might be conceived of as universals,\nor as individuals\u2014that is, property-instances, which are\nsometimes called \u2018tropes\u2019. There are, therefore, four\noptions for the bundle theorist.\n\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of some relation\nbetween properties conceived of as universals.\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of properties\nconceived of as individuals, e.g., as property-instances or\ntropes.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties\nconceived of as universals.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties\nconceived of as individuals.\n\n\nThe main objections to the \u2018universals\u2019 form of the theory\nrest on its apparent commitment to the Identity of Indiscernibles, for\nif an object is no more than a bundle of properties, then if\na and b have exactly the same properties, they are\nthe same bundle. Whether it does carry this commitment may depend on\nwhether one allows spatial points as particulars, in addition to the\nproperties that are universal. If one did, then the universal theories\nwould not entail the identity of indiscernibles, for the same\nuniversals could be in two bundles by being at two different\nlocations.\n\nIf properties are conceived of as individuals\u2014otherwise known as\ntropes, property-instances or individualised forms\u2014then there\ncannot be a problem about the distinctness of exactly similar bundles,\nfor the difference is built into the identity of the elements of the\nbundle, as it is not if the bundle is made of universals. The problem\nfor this version of the bundle theory seems to be that it is difficult\nto individuate or distinguish tropes in a way that makes them suitable\nto be individuals\u2014in one sense, the substances\u2014from which\nobjects are made (Armstrong 1989: 115ff). For example, if an object\nhas a size, a mass, and a motion, are the size and the mass different\ntropes and is it not strange to think of the size alone as a genuine\nparticular suited to be treated as an \u2018atomic\u2019 component\nof the whole? One way out of this problem may be to resort to the\nnotion of a master property that was invoked in the discussion of\nLocke on substratum\n (section 2.5.1);\n that is, to the notion of one property of which all the others are\nmodes, as visual shape is a mode of colour, or extension is the master\nproperty of matter for Descartes. In the Newtonian model, solidity\nmight fill this role, for shape is merely the outline of the solidity\nwhich constitutes the heart of the object. In a sense, theories of\nthis kind are not ordinary bundle theories, for one property is chosen\nto fill the role of substratum, because the other properties inhere\nin, or are modes of, it. Whether anything could perform this role from\namongst the properties that are basic to modern, post-Newtonian\nphysics\u2014properties such as charm, energy, spin and mass\u2014is\nnot easy to judge.\n\nOne objection often made against the theory is that bundles are\nmereological sums, rather like Locke\u2019s \u2018masses of\nmatter\u2019, and that, therefore, any change of property is a change\nin the identity of the object. Various forms of essentialist solutions\nto this problem have been suggested, for example, by Simons (1994),\nand Barker and Jago (2018). I must admit to having difficulties seeing\nwhy the view that objects are constituted solely out of\nproperty-instances should commit one to a mereological view, any more\nthan the theory that they are constituted solely from material\nparticles would, so I do not see this as a special problem for the\nbundle theory.\n3.2.2. The concept of substratum or \u2018thin particular\u2019\n\nIf one is not satisfied with a bundle theory of substance, so that one\nthinks that an individual substance is more than a collection of\nproperties, how is one to understand this \u2018more\u2019? This\nquestion can be given a deflationary or a substantive answer. The\ndeflationary answer is that a substance is a thing which has\nproperties, and that is all one needs to say (see, for example, Crane\nand Farkas 2004, 143f, and Chisholm 1969). An object is not composed\nof properties and some further ingredient\u2014the\n\u2018thingy\u2019 bit\u2014an object is something that simply has\nproperties. Any feature of it can, of course, be regarded as a\nproperty, but that does not render an object nothing but a collection\nof properties. There seems to be a clash of intuitions at this point\nabout what makes sense. An opponent of the deflationary view will say\nthat properties, however understood, must be components of objects,\nconceptually or formally speaking. If they are not the only components\nin this sense, one must say something about the nature of the rest.\nThe deflationist thinks that this line of thought embodies some kind\nof category mistake in the way it handles the idea of a component. The\nanti-deflationist will argue that the fact that we are talking about\ncomponents only in a conceptual sense does not alter the fact that we\nare obliged, once we start, to offer an account that is complete and\ndistinguishes the various elements.\n\nBennett offers one way out of the need to postulate a mysterious\nsubstratum:\n\nWhen I say \u2018This is an orange\u2019 I mean that there are here\ninstances of certain properties such as orangeness, sphericality etc.,\nand I indicate that I am operating on my ideas of those instances\nin a certain combining manner. (1987: 202; italics added)\n\n\nThis solution, as Bennett recognises, makes substancehood a function\nof how we operate on the properties we perceive. It is, in that sense,\nmore Kantian than realist. As what it recognises as out there in the\nworld is just a bundle of properties, it does not dissolve the problem\nin the way that a deflationist would require.\n\nSubstantive theories take the thought of a further component\nseriously, and, though they do not seem to be generally distinguished,\nthere are two main conceptions of this extra element, which I will\ncall the \u2018thin particular\u2019 and the\n\u2018substratum\u2019 conceptions. \u2018Thin particular\u2019 is\nan expression of D. M. Armstrong\u2019s. It is the particular in\nabstraction from its properties. When considered with its properties\nit is a thick particular. The important point is that thin\nparticulars really are particulars. \u2018Bertrand Russell might have\nbeen a fried egg\u2019: that is, the thin particular associated with\none set of properties and, hence, with one thing, might have belonged\nto another. Different properties might have been hung on this hook. It\nis not so clear, by contrast, that a substratum of the kind Locke\nconsiders, or like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter, is a particular in\nthis sense. It is more like a kind of stuff\u2014the substantiveness\non to which properties are stuck. On this conception, the suggestion\nthat the \u2018piece\u2019 of substratum or \u2018prime\nmatter\u2019 that is here in object a, might always\ninstead have been there in object b, seems to lack\ncontent.\n\nIt is useful at this point to take note of the three different\nfunctions the thin particular or substratum might fulfil. Its role\nmight be (i) to bind the properties into a unity, so that they do not\n\u2018fall apart\u2019: (ii) to individualise them, if they are\nuniversals: (iii) to carry one across the categorial barrier from\nproperty to substance; that is, to be what it is that makes something\nto be in the category of substance.\n\nThe first role will not be necessary if one thinks that there is a\n\u2018master property\u2019 of which the others are modes, or if one\nthinks that unity can come from some causal or organisational\nconnection. (ii) will not apply to a tropist theory, or if one thinks\nthat location will do the job. (iii) rests on the intuition that no\ncollection of properties could, in themselves, amount to a\nsubstance: the very idea is a category mistake, and only the\npresence of a special \u2018substantializing\u2019 element could do\nthat. It might be argued that this intuition begs the question against\nthe bundle theory. At the current state of the debate, it looks as if\nthere is no compelling reason for accepting substratum.\n3.3 Substances and sortals\n\nThe Aristotelian tradition anchors the concept of substance, at least\nin nature, primarily to instances of species of natural object. The\nKantian tradition ties it to those enduring bodies the individuation\nof which gives sense and structure to our spatio-temporal framework.\nDavid Wiggins (1967, 1980, 2001) has made a sustained attempt to prove\nthat these two objectives necessarily go together and to make the\nAristotelian notion of substance, even including its bias towards the\nbiological, central to our practice of individuating objects.\n\nWiggins assumes that individuating a temporally enduring object\ninvolves being able to re-identify it at different times and under\ndifferent descriptions. This assumption makes it possible to state\nsubstance individuation using the language of identity. Within the\nscope of this assumption, he makes two claims. The first is the sortal\nrelativity of identity: that is, when any a and b\nare asserted to be the same thing, they must be the same\nsomething-or-other, and the something-or-other must\nbe the kind of concept that answers \u2018what is it?\u2019\nquestions. In other words, there is no such a thing as \u2018bare\nidentity\u2019\u2014identity under no concept at all. Furthermore,\nthe relevant concept must be an Aristotelian substance concept or\nsortal. More formally, this can be expressed as follows:\n\nIf a = b then (a) there is a sortal F such\nthat:\n\n\na is an F\nb is an F\na is the same F as b.\n\n\n\nThe second claim is that is that if the object picked out by\n\u2018a\u2019 also falls under another sortal, G,\nthen so will the object picked out by \u2018b\u2019, and it\nwill be the same G as a. This is represented as an\napplication of Leibniz\u2019s Law, for if a is\nthe-same-G-as-a (as it must be) then, as a\n= b, b must be\nthe-same-G-as-a.\n\n(b) for any sortal G,\n\n\na is G iff b is G,\nif a is G then b is the same G\nas a.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion is striking because it is a denial that a and\nb might be identical under one form of identification, but\nnot under another. In fact it implies that every individuable object\nfalls under just one ultimate sortal. (Wiggins admits this in 2001: 67\nn.7. What is meant by ultimate sortal will emerge below.) For\nevery ultimate sortal has its own principle of individuation, and if\nan object fell under more than one, there could be a time at which it\nsatisfied the criteria for one and not for the other. Wiggins\u2019s\nthesis is a very strong claim, apparently backed up by a powerful\nargument. It is a strong claim for it purports to prove that any world\nwith individuable objects must be constituted by Aristotelian\nsubstances. The argument is powerful because it follows by simple\nlogic, granted seemingly plausible claims about identity, and\nLeibniz\u2019s Law.\n\nOn the other hand, there seem to be many cases of objects, which can\nbe identified under a variety of concepts, leading to different life\nhistories. This is termed relativity of identity. For\nexample, a and b may be the same person but not the\nsame child because b is a grown up and no longer a child. Or\na and b may be the same lump of clay but not the\nsame statue because b is the lump after it has been reshaped\nout of its statue shape. These are the most typical kinds of counter\nexamples and Wiggins has responses to both. He deals with the first by\ninvoking the concept of a phase sortal. A phase sortal is one\nthat, by its meaning, denotes part of the life history of something,\nwhich, as a whole, is denoted by another sortal. So child is\na phase sortal that applies to a phase of the things fully designated\nby human being. This illuminates an important aspect of the\nconcept of a sortal. It is a necessary condition for\nF\u2019s being an ultimate sortal that, whenever it applies\nto something, it applies in a present-tensed manner to the thing\nthrough the whole of its existence.\n\nThe statue and the lump of clay are dealt with by denying that the\nlump and the statue are identical: the lump of clay\nconstitutes the statue, but is not identical with it. Notice\nthat he could have argued that the statue was just a phase of the\nlump, but he does not do so because statue is not, by its\nvery meaning, a phase sortal: statue, unlike child,\ndoes not indicate by its meaning a period in the existence of\nsomething.\n\nSo Wiggins deals with objections mainly by two distinctions. One is\nbetween sortals that apply to objects through the whole of their\nexistence, and sortals appropriate only to a phase of their existence:\nthe other is between the \u2018is\u2019 of identity and the\n\u2018is\u2019 of constitution. Correspondingly, criticism centres\non whether the concepts under which we pick things out behave in as\nregimented a way as Wiggins requires, and on whether the\n\u2018is\u2019 of constitution is sufficiently different from the\n\u2018is\u2019 of identity to perform the task he wants of it.\n3.3.1 The discipline of sortal identification\n\nThere are certain kinds of counter-example that Wiggins does not\ndiscuss in print. There might, for example, be a sword-stick, which\nhas its blade removed and the inside of the cane filled with resin, so\nthat it ceases to be a sword but remains the same walking stick.\nWalking stick and sword are perfectly good concepts\nfor picking out objects, if any artefactual terms are, and, on pain of\nexcessive artificiality, a sword-stick is both a sword and a walking\nstick. This kind of example does not appear to occur amongst natural\nobjects, but, as a sword-stick is a perfectly good reidentifiable\nobject, this fact about natural objects would seem to be a contingent\ntruth about them. Of course, it is not an accident that\nnature works that way, but neither is it a conceptual requirement.\nWiggins\u2019s original proof was a priori, and it should allow no\nexceptions. Wiggins\u2019s response to this example (in personal\ncommunication) is that the sword-stick ceases to exist when it loses\nits ability to function as a sword and is replaced by a walking stick.\nBut this response too is ad hoc. It embodies the principle\nthat if anything is both an F and a G, where\nF and G are normally ordinary sortals, then it is\nreally an F/G and ceases to exist if it loses either\nits F or its G features and is replaced by something\nthat is either just an F or just a G.\n\nOne possible way out of this kind of case is to say that the sword is\na phase of the walking stick, thereby introducing ad hoc phase\nsortals. By the expression \u2018ad hoc phase sortal\u2019 I mean a\nsortal that can be used sometimes as a phase sortal, designating an\nobject only through part of its existence, and sometimes as an\nultimate sortal, designating an object through the whole of its\nexistence. Of course, even a normal phase sortal might, contingently,\nin a given instance, designate an object through the whole of its\nexistence. One might say that the phase sortal baby could\ndesignate something through the whole of its existence if, for\nexample, a human being died at the age of six months and hence never\ngot beyond babyhood. But it remains the case that, by dint of the\nmeaning of the term, a baby is a phase of a human being (or, perhaps,\nsome other animal) even when a particular creature fails to get beyond\nthat phase. A sword is not, however, in virtue of the meaning of the\nword \u2018sword\u2019, a phase of anything, and to use the term to\nname a phase of something in a given case, when it suits, is ad hoc.\nAllowing sortals of this kind would put the concept of sortal under\npressure, for an ultimate sortal was originally thought to be a kind\nof concept that necessarily characterises an object present-tensedly\nthroughout its existence, not a concept that sometimes does and\nsometimes does not. If it were possible for a given sortal, such as\nsword, sometimes to be an ultimate sortal and sometimes a\nphase sortal, it is not clear how such an expression would differ from\nan expression such as brown thing, which may or may not\ncharacterise something through the whole of its existence. But it is\nvital that the distinction between sortals, phase or ultimate, and\nexpressions such as brown thing be clearly maintained, if the\nnotion of sortal is to serve any formal purpose.\n\nMore importantly, that there are no ad hoc sortals is essential to the\nsignificance of the formal proof that there is no such thing as\nrelative identity. In logic and in the application of Leibniz\u2019s\nLaw, \u2018a is F\u2019 is normally equivalent to\n\u2018a was, is or will be F\u2019, otherwise the\nLaw would not apply to such accidental properties as \u2018is\nbrown\u2019. This is also the way phase sortals work: a human being\nis, was, or will be a baby. The argument against relative identity\nworks by arguing that, if one allowed relative identity, a\ncontradiction would follow, namely that one would get a situation in\nwhich a is G, a = b and b\nis not G. For this to be a contradiction, \u2018is\nG\u2019 must be univocal in both cases as either\n\u2018\u2014was, is or will be G\u2019 or \u2018\u2014is\nat all times G\u2019. For there is no inconsistency in\na is, was, or will be G, a = b,\nand b is not at all times G. But if, whenever a\ncontradiction is generated, one deems one of the sortals to be a phase\nsortal, and so to fall under the \u2018is, was, or will be\u2019\nrubric, and the other to be the ultimate sortal which applies at all\ntimes, no contradiction will ever arise. All the cases of putative\nrelative identity could be reconciled with Leibniz\u2019s Law by\ndeeming one of the sortals to be operating as a phase sortal in this\ninstance.\n\nAnother possible line is that a sword-stick is not one object, but two\nobjects that share some of their matter. This introduces a category of\nwhat one might call Siamese objects. It can be argued,\nhowever, that allowing this kind of entity undermines Wiggins\u2019s\nopposition to those, like Ayers, who think that the concept for\nreidentifying objects is, or often is, something more generic than\nsortal concepts; something akin to material body. To see how\nthis may come about, we must consider the rationale for Ayers\u2019s\ntheory.\n\nThe fact that sortals do not seem to follow the discipline that\nWiggins wishes for them might be taken to support the view that\nsubstances can be individuated under much more generic notions, such\nas same body or same material thing (Ayers 1991a).\nOn this view, material cohesion is what picks out paradigmatic\nphysical things. Wiggins regards these ideas as too generic to be\nadequate on their own. Such a concept cannot be \u201cunderstood\nexcept as determinable that has dog, horse,\nball, [etc] among its determinations\u201d (1997:\n417\u20138).\n\nAyers, on the other hand, thinks that Wiggins takes the notion of body\ntoo loosely, because he [Wiggins] classifies as \u2018lump-mass\nterms\u2019 everything from bars of soap and pats of butter to pools\nof water and pots of stew (Ayers 1991b: 229\u201330). Wiggins, in\nother words, does not take seriously enough the cohesiveness of real\nbodies, conflating them too easily with looser masses of matter. One\nnatural thought is that we can reidentify middle-sized physical bodies\nthat have fairly stable properties, irrespective of whether there is\nany interesting sortal term under which they fall. This is not to say\nthat they could be reidentified under the purely generic notions\nbody or physical thing, if there were no continuity\nof manifest properties.\n\nThat this may be a powerful criticism of Wiggins\u2019s view can be\nseen by considering the notion of a Siamese object, which seemed to be\nnecessary to answer the kind of problem posed by the sword-stick. The\nphysical mass that houses both the sword and the walking stick can be\nidentified independently of either. If this were not the case it is\ndifficult to see how one could even make the mistake of thinking of it\nas one thing. The composites Siamese entities form are quite\nidentifiable, and yet that entity is not supposed to fall under a\nsortal in its own right.\n\nThe ontological status of complex bodies and \u2018masses of\nmatter\u2019 (in Locke\u2019s phrase) is an issue very much under\ndispute and we shall return to it below.\n3.3.2 The \u2018is\u2019 of constitution\n\nA statue and a lump of clay occupy the same place at a given time.\nWhat is their relation to each other? The apparent options are (i)\nthey are identical (ii) they are not identical, but the clay\nconstitutes the statue. (i) appears to be ruled out because they have\ndifferent identity conditions. (ii) has seemed to many philosophers to\nbe the natural solution to the problem, but it, too, faces\ndifficulties. First, it has the intuitive disadvantage that it\nallocates two solid physical objects to the same place. Each of them\nweighs, say, ten pounds, yet the total of their weight is only ten\npounds. It might seem natural to think\u2014and it was formerly a\nwell established maxim\u2014that there can be only one solid physical\nthing at one place at a given time. Someone impressed by the idea that\ntwo bodies cannot be in the same place at the same time might think it\nmore natural to say that there are two different ways of\nconceptualising the material presence at that point, than that there\nare two material things. That way it is easy to see why two ten pound\nobjects need not add up to twenty pounds when put together.\n\nSecond, the language of constitution is more natural if the situation\nis described in some ways rather than others. It is natural to say\nthat the statue is made of clay or even from a piece of clay.\nBut suppose one characterises the clay more exactly, in terms of the\nparticular atoms in a particular arrangement. Strictly, on modal\ngrounds, this structured collection and the statue are different. The\nstatue could have been made of a collection of atoms with at least\nsome different members, but the entity defined as containing just\nthose atoms could not. This entity\u2014atoms\nA1\u2026An in given spatial arrangement\nS\u2014is not a very natural kind of object, but it is a real body,\nin a way that something arbitrarily composed of, for example, half of\nthis table and two toes from President Bush\u2019s left foot is not.\nThis collection of atoms in this structure is what investigation would\nshow to be really there. Though it is natural to say that the statue\nis constituted by the atoms, it is less natural to say that the atoms\nand the structure taken together, are what it is made from: rather it\nmight seem natural to say that that is what it is. To use the\nAristotelian terminology, there is strong pressure to say that atoms\nand structure together are matter and form, and hence are the\ncomplete individual.\n\nAll these issues are very controversial, and different philosophers\nhave different intuitions (see, for example, Rea 1997). But, if one\nwere to conclude that the statue and the lump are neither identical\nnor stand in the constitution relation, what else could one say? One\nstrategy is to take the notion of body or material\nobject as basic. In the next section, this possibility is\ncompared with other options.\n3.3.3 A possible reconciliation of Wiggins and Ayers.\n\nAs we saw above, for Wiggins the concept \u2018body\u2019 is always\ngeneric, never sufficient in its own right to sustain identification,\nneeding to be filled out by appeal to a more determinate sortal, such\nas \u2018dog\u2019 or \u2018table\u2019. Call this\n\u2018sortalism\u2019.\n\nFor Ayers, on the other hand the notion of a coherent, unified body or\nmaterial object is the basic notion for individuating objects and is\npresupposed by sortal concepts. It is only in so far as dogs and\ntables are unified bodies that these notions can be used to\nindividuate objects. Call this \u2018somatism\u2019.\n\nWe saw, briefly, in\n section 3.3.1,\n why Wiggins and Ayers think as they do. Although van Inwagen\u2019s\nposition is different from both, his reasons for thinking that the\nconcept of a complex body is, of its own, an inadequate\nconcept, are consistent with Wiggins\u2019s claim that the idea is\ntoo determinable to function in its own right. Van Inwagen, therefore,\nmore directly challenges Ayers. (For a brief discussion of van\nInwagen\u2019s argument, see\n section 3.4\n below.)\n\nHow might we choose between sortalism and somatism? The dispute\nbetween them can seem difficult to pin down. Perhaps an irenic\ncompromise is possible. Metaphysically, this compromise favours the\nsomatist, but seems to give the sortalist everything he should want.\nThe principle of the compromise is that Wiggins\u2019s formal\nargument is correct: and hence it is necessarily true that Relative\nIdentity is not possible. But it is only a contingent truth that the\nterms that can substitute for F in his formal proof are\ngenerally\u2014but not always\u2014sortals of an Aristotelian kind.\nAnything can be substituted for F that picks the object out\nas a unified body.\n\nTake Wiggins\u2019s formula, a =F\nb, where it is assumed that the F is a material\nobject (not God or a spirit etc). The following theses might plausibly\nbe maintained.\n\nFor any identifiable and re-identifiable object, there must be\nsome predicate F that applies to it in a present-tense manner\nthrough the whole of its existence, and that, by its meaning, picks\nthe object out as a unified physical whole.\nAll natural ultimate sortals designate unified physical bodies in\nthe manner prescribed in (1), and so are very suitable as\nsubstitutions for F. It is logically possible, however, that\nthis might not have been so (there might logically have been natural\nsortals that worked like sword-stick), but that they do\nfollow this model, and are not like sword-stick, is a pretty deep fact\nabout our world and about any world with similar laws of nature to\nthose that hold in our world.\nArtefactual sortals generally designate distinct, unified bodies\n(as do \u2018sword\u2019 and \u2018walking stick\u2019 in the\nordinary cases), though exceptions (as in the case of the sword-stick\nconsidered above) are more common and less fantastic than in the\nnatural cases.\nThere are acceptable substitutions for F that would not\nnormally be classified as sortals, but using concepts such as\npiece, or hunk or lump of stuff. In at\nleast some of these cases, there is no sortal available.\n\u2018[Unified] body\u2019 could always do the job of\nF, because other, more specific, terms work just because the\nthings they designate are unified bodies. On its own, \u2018same\nbody\u2019 is just not very explanatory.\n\n\nThe account given in these five points has the advantage that it is\ncompatible with the fact that most identities involving\nreidentification are categorisable under sortals, but that there are\nother cases\u2014such as \u2018piece of\u2026\u2019, \u2018hunk\nof\u2026\u2019\u2014where this is not so. It also avoids the need\nto employ the \u2018\u201cis\u201d of constitution\u2019 to link\nsortals and particulars, like lumps and hunks, rather than just mass\nterms, such as \u2018clay\u2019 or \u2018gold\u2019. The case\nwhere the lump and the sortally individuated object do not coincide,\napplies only to some problematic artefactual cases, and in those cases\nthe sortal name of the artefact will not be suitable substitute for\nF, but the \u2018lump\u2019 expression will be. In that\nway, it will be possible to avoid the need to have two material\nobjects in the same place.\n3.4 Contemporary hylomorphism\n\nSince about the mid 1990s there has developed a debate covering\nsimilar territory to that disputed by Wiggins and Ayers, but having\nrather different roots. It claims to be a revival of a broadly\nAristotelian hylomorphism, but it comes mainly from disputes in\nmereology.\n\nDavid Lewis famously propounded the doctrine of Unrestricted\nComposition: that is, any combination of things in the world\nconstitutes a further thing (e.g., 1986, 211). So my left foot and any\narbitrary stone at the bottom of the sea constitutes an object, though\nan object of no descriptive or explanatory interest. In the opposite\ncorner, Peter van Inwagen (1990) denied that there was any such thing\nas composition, at least for inanimate material objects.\n\nVan Inwagen\u2019s main argument is that necessary and sufficient\n(particularly sufficient) conditions cannot be given for the kind of\ncohesion of parts that is supposed to bind atoms into complexes. None\nof the standard candidates\u2014contact, fastening, adhesion, fusion,\nnor any acceptable disjunction of them\u2014will suffice. They all\nhave counterexamples. So the notion cannot be well defined. The\narguments are subtle and interesting. The question might be raised\nwhether van Inwagen gives sufficient consideration to the possibility\nof taking a line similar to that taken by Putnam on natural kinds. One\nfixes putative paradigm cases of non-living complexes, and says that\nthe kind of cohesion required is whatever sort of bonding holds in\nthose cases. It seems unlikely that there will not be a reasonably\ntidy, scientific account of how atoms bond. Nevertheless, van\nInwagen\u2019s mereological nihilism has a stopping point, namely\nthat he believes that he, though a composite material object, really\ndoes exist. So organisms do exist.\n\nVan Inwagen\u2019s unwillingness (unlike the early Unger (1975)) to\napply the nihilism to himself, and others like him, prompted the\nthought in other philosophers that there may be a way of having a\ndoctrine of Restricted Composition on the basis of being things of the\nright kind\u2014namely having a structure of the right kind\u2014and\nthat this idea resembled Aristotle\u2019s notion of form and his\ndoctrine of hylomorphism. Philosophers following this line of thought\nincluded Fine (1999, 2010), Johnston (2006), Lowe (2011), Koslicki\n(2008), Rea (2011) and Jaworski (2011, 2012). It is difficult to\nprovide a compact account of these philosophers\u2019 positions, as\nit can seem that all they have in common is a belief in some form of\nrestricted composition and a sense that the Aristotelian label\n\u2019hylomorphism\u2019 helps to give their theories a pedigree. My\nstrategy here will be to illustrate modern hylomorphism mainly using\nthe examples of Jaworski and Johnston, then citing a major problem for\nany theory of this general kind, and illustrating this by reference to\nMarmodoro (2013), where good discussions of Lowe, Koslicki and Rea can\nbe found.\n\nIf there is a single notion that plays a role in the rationale of the\nrestriction of composition, it is probably structure. Jaworski\nprobably deploys this notion in the most straightforward way. He and\nRea both use the following illustration. If you compact a human being\nin a machine or waterproof bag, you retain the same matter, but lose\nthe human being, because you have destroyed the structure. Structure\nis, therefore, a real and essential element in many or most complex\nobjects. He explains his theory as follows. \n\n\nHylomorphism claims\u2026[t]hat structure is a basic ontological and\nexplanatory category. (2011: 169)\n\nStructure is also a basic explanatory principle in that it explains\nwhy members of this or that kind are able to engage in the behaviors\nthey do. It is because humans are organized as they are, for instance,\nthat they are able to speak, to learn, to engage in the range of\nactivities that distinguish them from other living things and from\nnon-living ones. (2011: 172)\n\n\nI think all the hylomorphists would agree with these statements, but\nthey each have their own way of stating the theory and it is not easy\nto fit them together. Johnston\u2019s central account is as follows.\n\n\n\nA statement of the genuine parts and principle of unity of an\nitem\u2026takes the following canonical form:\n\nWhat it is for\u2026(the item is specified here)\u2026to\nbe is for\u2026(some parts are specified here)...to have the\nproperty or stand in the relation\u2026(the principle of unity\nis specified here).\n\n\nAs in: What it is for this hydrochloric acid molecule to be\nis for this positive hydrogen ion and this negative chlorine ion\nto be bonded together. \u2026 The idea that each complex item\nwill have some such canonical statement true of it might be fairly\ncalled \u2018Hylomorphism\u2019. For it is the idea that each\ncomplex item admits of a real definition, or statement of its essence,\nin terms of its matter, understood as parts or components, and its\nform, understood as a principle of unity. (2006: 658)\n\n\nBut Johnston\u2019s notion of a \u2018principle of unity\u2019\nturns out to be so generous that his theory almost collapses into\nLewis\u2019s.\n\nConsider then all the myriad ways of constructing putative wholes from\nitems gravitationally related to other items. Are they all genuine\nwholes? Given Hylomorphism, there does not seem to be any happy way to\ninsist that they are not all wholes, even though very few of\nthem will be material objects or stable physical systems\u2026A\nwhole consisting of your eyeglasses and Pluto is too far from [normal\nphysical object] paradigms in respect of compactness and maximality to\ncount as a genuine whole in the ordinary sense. But it is fully,\ncompletely and genuinely true that it is a whole. (2006: 697)\n\n\nOne might wonder whether such an apparatus preserves what one might\nwant to save from a common-sense notion of composition.\n\nA general worry about the hylomorphist approach might be put as\nfollows. The modern hylomorphists do not claim to be interpreting\nAristotle, but to be inspired by his concept of form. This means that\nit is out of place simply to argue that they have not interpreted him\nin a scholarly fashion. Nevertheless, it is relevant to point it out\nif they have totally misunderstood his deployment of the concept of\nform, for if this is the case, it might suggest that they are\npretending to a solution to the composition problem that they do not\npossess. Someone who was sceptical about their claim to a solution\nmight start by pointing out that all the moderns reject the\n\u2019traditional\u2019 Aristotelian idea that form has a role as an\nefficient cause, actually making a difference to the way that its\nmatter behaves. They deny this because they all want their theories to\nbe consistent with the closure of the world under physics. At the same\ntime, they seem to intend their composites to have full ontological\nweight, and to have causal efficacy.\n\nJaworski is particularly clear in emphasising that he is a causal\npluralist and that the structural level is in no sense\nepiphenomenal or a mere logical construct out of the lower properties\n(see his 2011: 174). But one might query whether this is consistent\nwith accepting the possibility of closure under physics. Such closure\nnaturally raises the question of the causal claims made for form or\nstructure, and, hence, for their ontological weight. The importance of\nexplanations at the level of complex structures is not\ndisputed, but whether these represent just ways of\nconceptualising a fundamental level that we cannot normally\naccess, is another matter. Johnston raises this question (2006:\n660\u201362) but leaves it unresolved. Jaworski insists on causal\npluralism, but admits \u201call forces are operating at a fundamental\nphysical level\u201d: This latter remark seems to concede that what\none has in fact is an explanatory pluralism, with causation\nincluded in the domain of explanation, but all the brute force\nis confined to physics. Johnston is keen to deny that\nexplanation is a subjective or psychological phenomenon, but\nadmitting this does not place explanation in the world, in the sense\nin which the forces that actually make things happen are in the world:\nit only gives them the Platonic objectivity of propositions or\ntheories. \n\nIt seems that modern hylomorphism faces the following dilemma. The\nfollowing argument has appeal. \n\nThe concept of structure is essential to all or most natural\nsciences.\nIf something is essential to a valid mode of explanation or\nunderstanding, then it should be conceived realistically.\n\n\ntherefore\n\nThere are real structures in the world.\n\n\nBut the following also has appeal.\n\nIt is sufficient for the concept of structure to be applicable\nthat elements be appropriately arranged in the world, and these\narrangements can be characterised without employing the notion of\nstructure. This could be done by specifying the spatio-temporal\nlocation of the elements and their causal influence on each\nother.\n\n\nIf (4) is correct, it looks as if, though our structural concepts are\nwell grounded in reality, structures are not part of the basic\nfurniture of the world. This is, in fact, the same issue as whether\nKim\u2019s exclusion principle applies to the special sciences: that\nis, if physics gives a sufficient causal account of the location of\nall matter, are the other sciences merely heuristics, but strictly\nepiphenomenal? (see Kim 2005 and Robinson 2014). Perhaps the status of\nform and structure cannot be solved in a modern context without\nsolving the exclusion issue. \n\nAnna Marmodoro (2013) argues that the modern hylomorphists have\nmisunderstood Aristotle in a radical fashion, in a way that is\ndirectly connected with their concern about the unity and hence\nreality of composites. She claims, with strong backing from the text,\nthat form is not structure, because it is not a combination of parts.\nThe essence of form is its unity, and its unity depends essentially on\nthe fact that the matter that comes to compose it loses its previous\nidentity. By contrast, in any kind of structure of parts this identity\nis not lost; the parts are merely organised in a certain way.\n\nOn this interpretation, Aristotle must deny the core of (4), which is\nthat the behaviour of complexes derives necessarily from the primitive\ncausal powers of the elements and their spatial relations\u2014this\nis a \u2019bottom up\u2019 atomist principle., and presupposes that\nthe parts retain their identity within composites. But without this\ncore idea in (4), it is difficult to see how there can be\n\u2018closure under physics\u2019, for if the atoms did not retain\ntheir identity, how could the nomic structure that rests on them be\npreserved?\n\nThere seems to be, therefore, a tension between two principles the\nmodern hylomorphists seem to want to preserve. The tension is between\nthe role of form as the creator of a genuine, non-conventional unity\nin composites, and an openness to the modern belief in the closure of\nthe world under physics.\n\nMarmodoro\u2019s concern about Aristotelian unity also indicates a\ndifference between hylomorphism and the actual nature of substances,\nnamely concerning the vagueness that attaches to most of our substance\nconcepts. For most of our concepts, there are paradigm cases, but also\nmarginal cases. This is an almost inevitable consequence of taking\nseriously the atomic constitution of objects, for there will be no\nvery neat constraints on how they might combine. There are many\ntheories about how one should react to vagueness, but one of the most\ncommon and intuitive is to say that it is a conceptual\nmatter\u2014reality itself cannot be vague. This tends against a\nrealist and in favour of a conceptualist approach to our substance\nconcepts: if our macro\u2013substance concepts are prone to\nvagueness, and if vagueness is a sign that the concept in question is\nnot to be taken in a realist fashion, then Locke would be right that\nwhat we normally regard as substances are just our ways of classifying\nthings.\n\nThis conceptualist approach is reinforced if one accepts both what has\nbeen called the Eleatic Principle, namely that something can be a\nreal, concrete entity only if it has causal powers of its own, and,\nthat the physical world is \u201cclosed under physics\u201d. The\nlatter entails that only the entities of physics influence the\ndistribution and motion of matter, so that higher-order entities,\nthough they may figure in essential forms of explanation, have no\ninfluence on that on which everything physical supervenes. Applying\nthe Eleatic Principle to this, macro \u201centities\u201d are not\nreal in the way that anything worth calling hylomorphism, in the\nAristotelian tradition, requires (Robinson 2016: Part II).\n3.5 Substance and teleology\n\nThere is one mark of substance that was important to Aristotle that we\nhave not discussed. This is the connection between substance and\nteleology; that is, the notion that what something is is\nintimately connected with its natural purpose, end or function. The\nassociation with teleology does not naturally recommend itself to the\nmodern mind. Wiggins, for example, says that \u201cit would have been\nboth possible and advantageous for Aristotle to distance [his account\nof substance] from his concern with final causes\u2026\u201d (2001:\n80). The concern with teleology is presumably thought to be too\nclosely connected with Aristotle\u2019s theology, or the idea that it\nis divine design or intelligence that gives natural objects their\nends. Nevertheless, it is not easy for an Aristotelian to make a\ncomplete break from teleology. Teleology is what distinguishes living\nthings that act for purposes and have organs with functions from lumps\nand rocks, and it is the former that Aristotelians see as the paradigm\nsubstances. It is no accident, therefore, that artefacts, which are\ngenerally defined by their function, are often cited as good\nillustrations\u2014even if not paradigm cases\u2014of substances. So\nwe have a tension developing. On the one hand, lumps and rocks are\ngood paradigm cases of our notion of natural enduring objects. But\nthey are bad cases of objects with purposes or ends. Artefacts are\ngood cases of things with purposes, and are reasonably enduring, but\nare not natural objects. Living things come near to getting the best\nof both worlds. They are natural and enduring, and they have purposes,\nin the sense of natural goals in their behaviour. (Although, according\nto the modern perspective they do not possess a final end, unlike\nartefacts: a knife is for cutting, but there is nothing a dog is\nfor, though it has many ends en passant.)\n\nThis teleological approach to substance could be expressed as\nfollows.\n\nThe substances in a given system are those entities crucial from\nthe teleological or design perspective of that system.\n\u2018Crucial\u2019, here, means that other things exist either to\nconstitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.\n\n\nThe tension between the teleological mark of the substantial and the\nothers we have considered might make it useful to distinguish between\ndescriptive ontological priority and teleological\nontological priority. The former is interested in a purely\ndescriptive account of what exists, and it, therefore, rates as the\nsubstances those entities that a purely descriptive science would\ncount as basic. The latter, however, counts as substances those things\nthat are deemed fundamental because of the role or function they play\nin the world. This contrast is most plain in the case of artefacts. An\nartefact is made of its parts, and, in a sense, they are more basic\nthan it because they constitute it. But if there were not artefacts of\nthe appropriate kind, those parts would never have come into\nexistence: if there were no motor cars, there would be no steering\nwheels or accelerator pedals. Thus, like Aristotle\u2019s severed\nfinger (Metaphysics 1035b 23\u20135), these latter do not\ncount as substances. But it is not true that the parts would not exist\nwithout the whole if one takes parts right down to the\nnatural elements and atoms that make the artefact. Then one has a\nconflict about what is deemed basic between the descriptive and the\nteleological criteria. It is to avoid this conflict that Aristotle\nrejects atomism, by allowing that there are no true entities, only\nstuffs, more basic than those he wants to treat as substances by the\ncriteria of teleological significance. He avoids having to face the\nproblem that one set of things is basic or substantial descriptively,\nnamely the atoms from which everything is constituted, and another set\nof things\u2014the macroscopic objects of our ordinary\nlives\u2014are substances by the criterion of teleological\nimportance. Because matter is stuff, not individuals, the objects that\nare teleologically important are also the descriptively basic objects,\nbecause what they are made of are not objects at all.\n\nIt could be argued that atomism can be reconciled with treating the\nthings that are significant for us as substances only if one thinks of\nthe atoms as existing only in order to constitute such objects. This\nwould be so if God had created the atoms so as to construct\nmacroscopic objects from them, just as we create the parts of\nartefacts only for the sake of the artefacts. It might be argued that\nthe same objective could be reached without theism if there is\nirreducible teleology in nature that gives significance to the rest.\nThomas Nagel\u2019s view in his (2012) either adopts or comes close\nto this position. But Nagel\u2019s position seems to challenge\nnatural science within its own realm, whereas the \u201ctheological\nartefact\u201d model does not. It is uncontroversial that an\nartefact, such as a clock, can be both mechanical and defined as the\nkind of thing that it is by its function. Applying this model to\nnature as a whole would involve bringing theology into\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysics more directly than he, or indeed\nAquinas, intended. The notion that an object is what it is because of\nits use is found in Heidegger (1927 [2008]) but this is the use to\nwhich we put objects, not a divinely ordained teleology;\nHeidegger\u2019s theory imports the subjective perspective implicit\nin phenomenology, and this runs counter to Aristotle\u2019s\nobjectivism. If, however, one takes the teleology to be designed into\ncreation, this subjectivism is eliminated, and if one thinks that\nteleology is the key determinant of substantial identity, as with\nartefacts, then one has preserved the doctrine of substance, rather\nthan replacing it by a mere theory of function. This would have the\nconsequence that if the designer could change the purpose of an object\nwhilst leaving it physically unchanged\u2014as we do if we use a\nknife as a screwdriver\u2014then its substantial identity will change\n(Schillebeeckx, 1968, Dummett, 1987, Robinson, 2016)\n4. Conclusion\n\nAll non-relativist philosophical systems acknowledge substances in the\nmost generic sense of that term, for that is only to acknowledge that\nthere are some fundamental entities in their system. Most, if not all,\nphilosophers acknowledge that we cannot function without using\nsubstance concepts in the narrower sense, for the notion of an\nenduring particular or individual substance is essential to our making\nsense of the world as we live in it. But three things at least remain\ncontroversial. First, it is disputed what kinds of concepts need to be\ndeployed to characterise these enduring things: are they the rich\nvariety of traditional or \u2018Aristotelian\u2019 substance\nconcepts, or will various ways of identifying things simply as\nphysical bodies with certain characteristics do the job? Second, it is\nstill unclear how far our substance concepts purport to reflect a\ncomponent in reality (real or imagined) over and above the bundle of\nproperties that constitute its intelligible aspects. Third, the\nunclarity of the connection between what a thing is and\nwhat it does leaves unresolved the degree of interdependence\nbetween substance concepts and notions of purpose and final\ncausation.",
