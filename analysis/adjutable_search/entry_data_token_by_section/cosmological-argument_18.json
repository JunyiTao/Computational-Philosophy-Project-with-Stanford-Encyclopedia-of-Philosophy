    "main_text": "An Inductive Cosmological Argument\n8. An Inductive Cosmological Argument\n\nRichard Swinburne contends that the cosmological argument is not\ndeductively valid; if it were, \n\n\nit would be incoherent to assert that a complex physical universe\nexists and that God does not exist. There would be a hidden\ncontradiction buried in such co-assertions\u2026. [A]ttempts to\nderive obviously incoherent propositions from such co-assertions have\nfailed through commission of some elementary logical error. (2004:\n136) \n\n\nSwinburne is correct that if someone believes that a deductive\ncosmological argument (proof) for God\u2019s existence is sound, then\nit would be incoherent for that same person to then deny that God\nexists. However, in their respective proofs defenders of the deductive\ncosmological arguments make a claim about incoherence, namely, that it\nwould be contradictory for the same person to affirm the premises of\nthe argument and to claim that God or a personal necessary being does\nnot exist. And they believe both that the respective premises have the\nintuitiveness that Swinburne deems necessary and that the argument has\nnot committed some \u201celementary error of logic\u201d. \n\nHas Swinburne shown incoherence? Whereas propositions are true and\ndeductive arguments are valid independent of anyone\u2019s beliefs\nthat they are true and valid (the proposition that the earth orbits\nthe sun is true regardless of whether anyone believes it), the\nacceptance of premises as true, of deductive arguments as valid, and\nof an argument\u2019s use as a proof is not independent of those same\nbeliefs. An argument that one person takes as being sound another\nmight believe not to be sound, in that the person rejects one or more\nof the premises or holds that the conclusions fail to properly follow;\narguments are person-relative in their persuasive value or assessment\nof coherence. Swinburne himself notes that arguments of coherence and\nincoherence are persuasive only to the extent that someone accepts\nother statements inherent to the proof as coherent or incoherent and\nthat one statement entails another (1993: 39). Elsewhere Swinburne\nadmits to having \n\n\nsome doubt about whether men have enough initial consensus about what\nis coherent and what entails what, are clever enough and have enough\nimagination to reach agreed proofs which would settle all disputes\nabout whether a statement is coherent or incoherent. (1993: 45) \n\n\nAs such, Swinburne cannot so easily dismiss deductive cosmological\narguments, although he is justified in wondering whether\n\u201creasons less strong than compelling proofs can be given for\nthinking some statements coherent and others incoherent\u201d (1993:\n45).\n\nIn place of a deductive argument, Swinburne develops an inductive\ncosmological argument that appeals to the inference to the best\nexplanation. Swinburne distinguishes between two varieties of\ninductive arguments: those that show that the conclusion is more\nprobable than not (what he terms a correct P-inductive argument) and\nthose that further increase the probability of the conclusion (what he\nterms a correct C-inductive argument). In The Existence of\nGod (1979) he presents a cosmological argument that he claims\nfalls in the category of C-inductive arguments. However, for him this\nargument is part of a larger, cumulative case for a P-inductive\nargument for God\u2019s existence that includes as its evidence the\norderliness of the universe, the existence of consciousness, miracle\nreports, and religious experience.\n\nSwinburne notes that \u201ca cosmological argument argues that the\nfact that there is a universe needs explaining\u201d (2004:\n9\u201310). However, he emphasizes that his approach differs from\nthose we have already considered in that he rejects the Principle of\nSufficient Reason understood as \u201ceverything not\n\u2018metaphysically necessary\u2019 has an explanation in something\n\u2018metaphysically necessary\u2019\u201d (2004: 148), for the PSR\nleads, as it does in Leibniz, to a being that is logically necessary,\nand such a being cannot explain the logically contingent. From the\nlogically necessary only the logically necessary follows. In place of\nusing the PSR to construct a deductive argument, he employs a\n\u201cbasic theorem of confirmation theory\u201d, Bayes\u2019\nTheorem, to construct an inductive argument (2004: 67). (In making\nthis claim about the need for an explanation of the universe,\nhowever, it is hard not to see that he invokes some formulation of the\nPSR.)\n\nSwinburne begins his discussion with the existence of a physical\nuniverse that (a) contains odd events that cannot be fitted into the\nestablished pattern of scientific explanation (e.g., miracles, the\nappearance of conscious beings), (b) is too big in that science cannot\nexplain why there are states of affairs at all or why the fundamental\nnatural laws to which science appeals to explain things hold, and (c)\nis complex (its matter-energy has relevant powers) (2004: 74, 150).\n\n\nIt is not logically necessary that the existence of the universe needs\nexplanation; we could accept this universe as a brute, inexplicable\nfact, but Swinburne thinks that to do so fails to accord with the\nexample of the sciences, which seek the best explanation for any given\nphenomena. Since \u201cit is reasonable to suppose\u201d that there\nis an explanation (2004: 75), the issue, then, is which view is more\nreasonable: that science can provide a natural explanation for the\nexistence of this universe, or whether the universe and its phenomena\nexist because of the intentional, causal activity of a personal being\nwhose existence also is a brute fact.\n\nTo find the explanatory hypothesis most likely to be true, especially\nabout something that might be unobservable, he claims to follow the\nexample of science. Using Bayes\u2019 Theorem, he looks for a\nhypothesis \\(h\\) such that \\(p(e\\mid h \\amp k) \\gt p(e\\mid k)\\) where\n\\(p\\) is probability, \\(e\\) is the existence of a complex universe,\nand \\(k\\) is the background data. A hypothesis is more likely to be\ntrue (1) in so far as it has high explanatory power, in that it makes\nprobable the evidence of the observation; this may be predictive but\ncan be postdictive as well (Swinburne 1996: 34, 2001: 80\u201381),\nand insofar as the evidence is very unlikely to occur if the\nhypothesis is false. And (2), it has a greater prior probability. The\nprior probability of a hypothesis encompasses three features: (a) how\nwell it fits with our background knowledge (2001: 81). The broader the\nscope, the less relevant this criterion becomes (2004: 60). Since\nthere are no \u201cneighboring fields of inquiry related to the\norigin of the universe\u201d, Swinburne treats this condition in the\ncosmological argument as irrelevant or reducing to the feature of\nsimplicity (1996: 29). (b) The scope of the hypothesis (the extent of\nits claims)\u2014the broader the scope, the less likely it is to be\ntrue. For example, all crows are black is less likely to be true than\nall crows along the upper Mississippi River are black. Since both\nscientific naturalism and theism have the same scope\u2014explaining\nthe universe, this does not factor into his calculations for\nexplaining the complex universe (2001: 82); and (c) simplicity, which\nfor Swinburne holds the key (2001: 82\u201383).\n\nHe holds that we are looking for a complete explanation, where \n\n\nwe may reasonably conclude that the criteria for supposing that\nfactors have no further explanation (scientific or personal) in terms\nof factors acting at the time and so that any explanation is a\ncomplete explanation over all (not just a complete explanation within\nscientific or within personal explanation) are that any attempt to go\nbeyond the factors that we have would result in no gain of explanatory\npower or prior probability. (2004: 89) \n\n\nA scientific explanation fails to give a complete explanation. It\nleaves us not with a simple but with a very complex explanatory\nhypothesis, in that \u201cultimate explanation stops at innumerable,\ndifferent stopping points, many of them \u2026 having exactly the\nsame powers and liabilities as each other\u201d (1996: 42). It\npresents us with the brute fact of the existence of the universe, not\nan explanation for it. It explains in terms of a full cause the events\nat any moment, but it cannot provide a complete explanation of the\nuniverse, \u201cfor there are no physical causes apart from the\nuniverse itself and parts thereof\u201d (1984: 144).\n\nOn the other hand, a personal explanation, given in terms of the\nintentional actions of a person, is simpler and no explanatory power\nis lost. Further, a personal explanation can be understood, as in the\ncase of explaining basic actions, without knowing or understanding any\nof the natural causal conditions that enable one to bring it about. In\nthe case of the cosmological argument, personal explanation is couched\nin terms of a being that has beliefs, purposes, and intentions, and\npossesses both the power to bring about the complex universe and a\npossible reason for doing so.\n\nSwinburne argues that a personal explanation of the universe satisfies\nthe above probability criteria. It satisfies condition (1) in that\nappealing to God as an intentional agent has explanatory power. It\nleads us to have certain expectations about the universe: that it\nmanifests order, is comprehensible, and favors the existence of beings\nthat can comprehend it. It makes probable the existence of the complex\nuniverse because God could have reasons for causing such a universe,\nwhereas we would have no reasons at all if all we had was the brute\nfact of the material universe. Among these reasons is that the\nuniverse would be \u201ca theatre for finite agents to develop and\nmake of it what they will\u201d (Swinburne 1979: 131).\n\nMichael Martin objects at this point. Martin contends that if\nSwinburne is to compare the a priori probability of there\nbeing a complex universe given our background knowledge with the a\npriori probability of a complex universe given our background\nknowledge and the existence of God, he has to be clear on how he\ninterprets the probability. Martin notes that herein lies crucial\nambiguity that disables calculating the a priori probability.\nIf one compares the very many possible complex universes with there\nbeing no universe, on the basis of assigning equal\nprobability to all possibilities the probability of there being a\ncomplex universe is nearly 1. However, if one compares the probability\nof there being a complex universe with there being no universe at all,\nit is 50 percent (Martin 1986: 155). Furthermore, Martin wonders\nwhether complexity is an issue at all. According to Swinburne, as free\nGod can create any kind of world or no world at all. But then the\nexistence of God is compatible with any number of scenarios: the\nexistence of no world, a simpler world than we have, one like ours, or\nany number of more complex universes. Consequently, the complexity of\nthis world does not matter in constructing an inductive\nargument for God\u2019s existence (1986: 155). Put another way,\nadding the existence of God to our background knowledge does not\nincrease the likelihood of there being a complex universe, let alone\nof there being this particular universe or a universe at all (1986:\n158). \n\nIn short, Martin does not see how Swinburne can establish an a\npriori probability for the existence of a complex universe, to be\ncompared with an a priori probability for the existence of\nGod based on simplicity, a feature of Swinburne\u2019s Bayesian\nargument. This introduces the theme of simplicity, to which Swinburne\ndevotes much attention.\n\nSwinburne goes on to argue that a personal explanation in terms of God\nsatisfies condition (2) because of its simplicity. If one is going to\nconstruct an explanatory hypothesis using the criterion of simplicity,\nGod rather than science is more likely to be the focus of the true\nexplanatory hypothesis. God is one and of one kind; polytheism is\nruled out. Moreover, God is the simplest kind of person there can be\nbecause a person is a being with power (to do intentional actions),\nknowledge, and freedom (to choose, uncaused, which actions to do), and\nin God these properties are infinite, and having infinite properties\nis simpler than having properties with limits, as humans do. \u201cIt\nis always simpler to postulate infinite or zero degrees of some\nproperty than a certain precise finite value of it\u201d (Swinburne\n1983: 385). Furthermore, God engages in simple causation, that is,\ncausation by simple intention. Swinburne concludes that although the\nprior likelihood of neither God nor the universe is particularly high,\nthe prior probability of a simple God exceeds that of a complex\nuniverse. Hence, if anything is to occur unexplained, it would be God,\nnot the universe.\n\nConsequently, if we are to explain the universe, we must appeal to a\npersonal explanation \n\n\nin terms of a person who is not part of the universe acting from\nwithout. This can be done if we suppose that such a person (God)\nbrings it about at each instant of time, that (the laws of nature)\n\\(L\\) operate. (Swinburne 1979: 126, 2004: 142) \n\n\nAlthough for Swinburne this argument does not make the existence of\nGod more probable than not (it is not a P-inductive argument), it does\nincrease the probability of God\u2019s existence (is a C-inductive\nargument) because it provides a more reasonable explanation for the\nuniverse than merely attributing it to the brute fact of the\nuniverse\u2019s existence. \n\n\nTheism does not make [certain phenomena] very probable; but nothing\nelse makes their occurrence in the least probable, and they cry out\nfor an explanation. A priori, theism is perhaps very\nunlikely, but it is far more likely than any rival supposition. Hence,\nour phenomena are substantial evidence for the truth of theism.\n(Swinburne 1979: 290)\n\n\nIn his critique of Swinburne, J. L. Mackie wonders whether personal\nexplanations are reducible to natural, scientific explanations. To\nimplement intentionality requires an entire system of neurological and\nmacro-biological conditions. Not only does God as nonphysical lack\nthese biological conditions, but these conditions are exceedingly\ncomplex, not simple. \u201cOnly by ignoring such key features [the\nrole of the body] do we get an analogue of supposed divine\naction\u201d (Mackie 1982: 100). When we incorporate these features,\nthe simplicity disappears.\n\nSwinburne replies that Mackie has misunderstood his argument.\n\u201cThe simplicity of the relation between intention and its\nrealization has nothing to do with how our will or intentions are\nrealized in practice\u201d (Swinburne 1983: 386). Even if we\nunderstand all the neural connections and firings, we may not achieve\nany better explanation of why persons intended to act as they did than\nsimply asking them why they acted as they did. This indicates that the\nexistence of intermediate physical causal links is not an essential\npart of personal explanation. In fact, Swinburne argues, since it is\neasier to understand the function of intention without invoking any\nphysical causal limitations, it makes it easier to understand the case\nof God who as nonphysical has no need for intermediary physical\nprocesses. Thus, he claims, Mackie missed the point about God when he\ninvokes the complexity of physical accounts. The point is that God can\nwill to act on his intentions directly, and this provides a simple\naccount or explanation of why things came to exist.\n\nThe critical aspect of Swinburne\u2019s argument is his almost total\nreliance in his inductive cosmological argument on simplicity as the\ndeciding factor between competing hypotheses regarding the cause of\nthe existence of the universe (2004: 333\u201334; 2010, 9;\nOstrowick). Swinburne has at least six understandings that one\nhypothesis is simpler than another. (1) It invokes the fewest number\nof entities (2004: 106; 1983: 386; 2001: 87; 2010, 5). This is a\nquantitative understanding. (2) It invokes the fewest kinds of\nentities\u2014a qualitative understanding (1983: 386, 2001: 87). (3)\nIt invokes entities with simple or few properties (1983: 386)\nSwinburne invokes a subcriterion that explanations are simpler when\nthe properties they invoke are observable (2010, 6). (4) It invokes\npowers, acquisition of beliefs, and consistency of intentions similar\nto ours when applied to personal explanation of rational behavior\n(2004: 61\u201364). (5) The explanation invokes the simplest\norganization of the features functioning in the explicans, e.g., laws\nor variables (2001: 83, 89\u201390). (6) Simplicity can be found in\nthe explicans in that it does not invoke extraneous features that are\nnot necessary to explain the effect (2001: 81).\n\nSwinburne holds that the appeal to God as an explanation is simpler in\nall of these\n ways.[4]\n Not only is there one entity and that entity is simple, the\nexplanation effectively has no organization of the features. The\nexplanation itself is simple. The appeal to God\u2019s causal\nactivity satisfies understanding or interpretation 6 in that it\ninvolves no extraneous entities to do the explaining and requires no\nintermediaries. God can bring about the effect by himself alone.\n\nSeveral important questions about simplicity arise. First, is\nsimplicity the criterion we should use to decide between hypotheses?\nFor one thing, simplicity is not always a reliable criterion for\ndetermining which hypothesis is true or which hypothesis provides the\nbest explanatory account. The rise of quantum explanations suggests\nthat the simplest account of the universe, for example, that of\nNewton, is not a complete and fully adequate account. The events in\nthe subatomic realm are far from explained simply. For another,\nalthough an explanation in terms of four factors might make an\nexplanation simpler, the reverse might hold: an explanation in terms\nof ten factors might be simpler than an explanation in terms of four\nbecause the relationships that hold between the ten factors are less\ncomplex than those that hold between the four, making for a simpler\nexplanation (Ostrowick 2012). In reply, Swinburne might grant this,\nbut argue that in these much more limited cases explanatory power,\nbackground knowledge, and scope now come into significant play in a\nway that they don\u2019t when addressing hypotheses explaining the\noddness, bigness, and complexity of the universe.\n\nSecond, why think that theism is simpler than naturalism? Oppy argues\nthat whereas both naturalism and theism equally fit the data and have\nthe same scope, naturalism is simpler, for theism is \n\n\ncommitted to two kinds of entities (the natural and the supernatural),\ntwo kinds of external relations (the natural and the supernatural),\ntwo kinds of causation (the natural and the supernatural), two kinds\nof non-topic-neutral properties (the natural and the supernatural),\nand so on, whereas naturalism is committed to only one kind in each of\nthese categories. (2013: 52) \n\n\nIn conclusion, Swinburne contends that it is very unlikely\nthat a universe would exist uncaused, but more likely that\nGod would exist uncaused. It is likely that if there is a\nGod, he will make something like the finite and complex universe. The\npuzzling existence of the universe can be made comprehensible\n(explicable) if we suppose it is brought about by a personal God with\nintentional beliefs and the power to bring intentions to fruition\n(2004: 152). Whether simplicity can bear the weight of his argument is\nthe key matter in question.\n",
