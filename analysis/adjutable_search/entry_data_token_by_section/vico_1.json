    "main_text": "Vico\u2019s Early Works\n2. Vico\u2019s Early Works\n\nVico\u2019s earliest publications were in poetry rather than\nphilosophy-the Lucretian poem \u201cAffetti di un disperato\u201d\n(\u201cThe Feelings of One in Despair\u201d) (composed in 1692) and\n\u201cCanzone in morte di Antonio Carafa\u201d (\u201cOde on the\nDeath of Antonio Carafa\u201d) both published in 1693. After his\nappointment to Professor of Rhetoric in 1699, Vico began to address\nphilosophical themes in the first of six Orazioni Inaugurali\n(Inaugural Orations). In 1707 Vico gave a seventh\noration-intended as an augmentation of the philosophy of Bacon that he\nsubsequently revised and published in 1709 under the title De\nnostri temporis studiorum ratione (On the Study Methods of\nOur Time). Two years later his projected but uncompleted\nstatement on metaphysics appeared, De antiquissima Italorum\nsapientia ex linguae latinae originibus eruenda libri tres\n(On the Most Ancient Wisdom of the Italians Unearthed from the\nOrigins of the Latin Language). The years that followed saw the\npublication of various works, including two replies to critical\nreviews of De antiquissima (1711 and 1712), a work of royal\nhistoriography-De rebus gestis Antonii Caraphaei libri\nquattuor (The Life of Antonio Caraffa) (1716)-Il\ndiritto universale (Universal Right) (1720\u201322),\nand in 1725 and 1731 the two parts of his autobiography which together\ncompose the Vita di Giambattista Vico scritta da se medesimo\n(Life of Giambattista Vico Written by Himself). Over the\ncourse of his professional career, Vico also composed and delivered\nlectures on rhetoric to students preparing to enter into the study of\njurisprudence. These survive as student transcriptions or copies of\nthe original lectures, and are collected under the title\nInstitutiones Oratoriae (1711\u20131741) (translated as\nThe Art of Rhetoric) in which Vico\u2019s develops his views\non rhetoric or eloquence, \u201cthe faculty of speaking appropriate\nto the purpose of persuading\u201d through which the orator aims to\n\u201cbend the spirit by his\n speech.\u201d[3]\n\nAlthough these early writings are increasingly studied as significant\nworks in their right, they have generally been regarded as important\nfor tracing the development of various themes and ideas which Vico\ncame to refine and express fully in his major and influential work,\nThe New Science. In De nostri temporis studiorum\nratione, for example, Vico takes up the theme of modernity and\nraises the question of \u201cwhich study method is finer or better,\nours or the Ancients?\u201d and illustrates \u201cby examples the\nadvantages and drawbacks of the respective\n methods.\u201d[4]\n Vico observes that the Moderns are equipped with the\n\u201cinstruments\u201d of \u201cphilosophical\n\u2018critique\u2019\u201d and \u201canalytic geometry\u201d\n(especially in the form of Cartesian logic) (DN, 7\u20139), and that\nthese open realms of natural scientific inquiry (chemistry,\npharmacology, astronomy, geographical exploration, and mechanics) and\nartistic production (realism in poetry, oratory, and sculpture) which\nwere unknown and unavailable to the Ancients (DN, 11\u201312).\nAlthough these bring significant benefits, Vico argues, modern\neducation suffers unnecessarily from ignoring the ars topica\n(art of topics) which encourage the use of imagination and memory in\norganizing speech into eloquent persuasion. The result, Vico argues,\nis an undue attention to the \u201cgeometrical method\u201d modeled\non the discipline of physics (DN, 21ff.), and an emphasis on abstract\nphilosophical criticism over poetry. This undermines the importance of\nexposition, persuasion, and pleasure in learning; it\n\u201cbenumbs...[the] imagination and stupefies...[the] memory\u201d\n(DN, 42), both of which are central to learning, complex reasoning,\nand the discovery of truth. Combining the methods of both Ancients and\nModerns, Vico argues that education should aim ideally at cultivating\nthe \u201ctotal life of the body politic\u201d (DN, 36): students\n\u201cshould be taught the totality of the sciences and arts, and\ntheir intellectual powers should be developed to the full\u201d so\nthat they \u201cwould become exact in science, clever in practical\nmatters, fluent in eloquence, imaginative in understanding poetry or\npainting, and strong in memorizing what they have learned in their\nlegal studies\u201d (DN, 19).\n\nThis defense of humanistic education is expanded in the\nOrations, directed \u201cto the flower and stock of\nwell-born young\n manhood,\u201d[5]\n where Vico makes a case for modern humanistic education and focuses\non a certain kind of \u201cpractical wisdom\u201d or\nprudentia which the human mind, with the appropriate\ndiscipline and diligence, is able to attain. This theme is continued\nin De Antiquissima, where Vico traces the consequences of his\ninsight that language can be treated as a source of historical\nknowledge. Many words of the Latin language, Vico observes, appear to\nbe \u201cderived from some inward learning rather than from the\nvernacular usage of the\n people.\u201d[6]\n Treated as a repository of the past, Latin might be investigated as a\nway of \u201cseek[ing] out the ancient wisdom of the Italians from\nthe very wisdom of their words.\u201d(DA, 40).\n\nIn the course of pursuing this task, Vico also develops two central\nthemes of his mature philosophy: the outlines of a philosophical\nsystem in contrast to the then dominant philosophy of Descartes\nalready criticized in De nostri temporis studiorum ratione,\nand his statement of the principle that verum et factum\nconvertuntur, that \u201cthe true and the made\nare...convertible,\u201d or that \u201cthe true is precisely what is\nmade\u201d (verum esse ipsum factum). Vico emphasizes that\nscience should be conceived as the \u201cgenus or mode by which a\nthing is made\u201d so that human science in general is a matter of\ndissecting the \u201canatomy of nature\u2019s works\u201d (DA, 48),\nalbeit through the \u201cvice\u201d of human beings that they are\nlimited to \u201cabstraction\u201d as opposed to the power of\n\u201cconstruction\u201d which is found in God alone (DA,\n50\u201352). Given that \u201cthe norm of the truth is to have made\nit\u201d (DA, 52), Vico reasons, Descartes\u2019 famous first\nprinciple that clear and distinct ideas are the source of truth must\nbe rejected: \u201cFor the mind does not make itself as it gets to\nknow itself,\u201d Vico observes, \u201cand since it does not make\nitself, it does not know the genus or mode by which it makes\nitself\u201d (DA, 52). Thus the truths of morality, natural science,\nand mathematics do not require \u201cmetaphysical\njustification\u201d as the Cartesians held, but demand an analysis of\nthe causes-the \u201cactivity\u201d-through which things are made\n(DA, 64).\n\nVico\u2019s Vita di Giambattista Vico is of particular\ninterest, not only as a source of insight into the influences on his\nintellectual development, but as one of the earliest and most\nsophisticated examples of philosophical autobiography. Vico composed\nthe work in response (and indeed the only response) to a proposal\npublished by Count Gian Artico di Porc\u00eda to Italian scholars to\nwrite their biographies for the edification of students. Referring to\nhimself in the third person, Vico records the course of his life and\nthe influence of various thinkers which led him to develop the\nconcepts central to his mature work. Vico reports on the importance of\nreading Plato, Aristotle, the Hellenics, Scotus, Suarez, and the\nClassical poets, and traces his growing interest in jurisprudence and\nthe Latin language (Vita, 116ff. passim). Vico describes how he came\nto \u201cmeditate a principle of the natural law, which should be apt\nfor the explanation of the origins of Roman law and every other\ngentile civil law in respect of history\u201d (Vita, 119) and how he\ndiscovered that \u201can ideal eternal law...should be observed in a\nuniversal city after the idea or design of providence\u201d (Vita,\n122). According to Vico\u2019s own account, his studies culminated in\na distinction between ideas and languages. The first, he says,\n\u201cdiscovers new historical principles of geography and\nchronology, the two ideas of history, and thence the principles of\nuniversal history lacking hitherto\u201d (Vita, 167), while the\nlatter \u201cdiscovers new principles of poetry, both of song and\nverse, and shows that both it and they sprang up by the same natural\nnecessity in all the first nations\u201d (Vita, 168). Taken together,\nthese form the central doctrine of The New Science, namely,\nthat there is a \u201cphilosophy and philology of the human\nrace\u201d which produces \u201can ideal eternal history based on\nthe idea of...providence...[and] traversed in time by all the\nparticular histories of the nations, each with its rise, development,\nacme, decline and fall\u201d (Vita, 169).\n",
