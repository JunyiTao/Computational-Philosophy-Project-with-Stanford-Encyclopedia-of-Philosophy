    "main_text": "Adjacent Concepts || Introduced\n2.1 Introduced\n\nIt may be helpful to say something about the relation of alienation to\nwhat can be called \u2018adjacent\u2019 concepts. The two examples\ndiscussed here are both drawn from Hegelian and Marxist traditions;\nnamely, the concepts of fetishism and objectification. Disambiguating\nthe relationship between these various concepts can help clarify the\ngeneral shape of alienation. However, they are also discussed because\nparticular accounts of alienation, both within and beyond those two\ntraditions, are sometimes said\u2014more or less plausibly\u2014to\nconflate alienation either with fetishism, or with objectification. Even if some particular treatments of alienation\ndo equate the relevant concepts with each other, alienation is better\nunderstood as synonymous with neither fetishism nor\nobjectification. Rather, fetishism is only one form that alienation can take, and not all objectification involves alienation.\n",
