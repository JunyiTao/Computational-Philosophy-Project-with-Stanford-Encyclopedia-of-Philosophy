    "main_text": "Inverted qualia scenarios || Locke\u2019s Inverted Spectrum Scenario\n2.2 Locke\u2019s Inverted Spectrum Scenario\n\n\nLocke appears to have been the first to formulate explicitly an\ninverted spectrum scenario. (An immediate precursor is \nMalebranche.[12]) \nIn the chapter of the Essay titled\nOf True and False Ideas, Locke writes:\nNeither would it carry any Imputation of Falshood\nto our simple Ideas, \\(if\\) by the different Structure of\nour Organs, it were so ordered, That the same Object should produce\nin several Men\u2019s Minds different Ideas at the same time;\nv.g. if the Idea, that a Violet produced in\none Man\u2019s Mind by his Eyes, were the same that a Marigold\nproduces in another Man\u2019s, and vice vers\u00e2. For since\nthis could never be known: because one Man\u2019s Mind could not pass into\nanother Man\u2019s Body, to perceive, what Appearances were produced by\nthose Organs; neither the Ideas hereby, nor the Names, would\nbe at all confounded, or any Falshood be in either. For all\nThings, that had the Texture of a Violet, producing constantly\nthe Idea, which he called Blue, and those which had\nthe Texture of a Marigold, producing constantly the\nIdea, which he as constantly called Yellow, whatever\nthose Appearances were in his Mind; he would be able as regularly to\ndistinguish Things for his Use by those Appearances, and understand,\nand signify those distinctions, marked by the Names Blue and\nYellow, as if the Appearances, or Ideas in his Mind,\nreceived from those two Flowers, were exactly the same, with the\nIdeas in other Men\u2019s Minds. (1689/1975, II, xxxii,\n15)\n\n\nLocke\u2019s description of this inverted spectrum scenario is laden with\nhis own commitment to \u201cIdeas\u201d, which (on one\ninterpretation) are sense-data, some of which possess both color and\n shape.[13]\n On this view, spectrum inversion is a case\nof \u201csense-datum inversion\u201d: when Invert looks at a violet\nshe becomes acquainted with the kind of sense-datum Nonvert is\nacquainted with when he looks at a marigold. Setting this tendentious\ntheoretical gloss aside, Locke\u2019s scenario has three notable features.\nFirst, it is a case of spectrum inversion from birth. Second,\nit is a case of inversion within the same linguistic\ncommunity. Third, it is (or is naturally read as being) a case in\nwhich Invert and Nonvert are behaviorally alike\u2014a\nbehaviorally undetectable spectrum inversion.\n\n\nLocke does not fill in the details of his scenario, so it is left\nunclear whether, for example, the leaves of marigolds and violets would\nproduce \u201cRed Ideas\u201d in the mind of the inverted subject.\nBut suppose, reasonably enough, that Locke\u2019s scenario involved a\nrotation of the hue circle. Locke evidently thought that the hypothesis\ncorresponding to his scenario was true: that his scenario is possible.\nWas he right?\n\n\nIf we assume that Invert is otherwise like a normal human perceiver,\nthen a major asymmetry in color space shows that Locke was incorrect.\nHue (red, green, bluish-red, etc.) is not the only perceptually salient\ndimension along which colors can vary: there are (usually taken to be)\ntwo other dimensions, saturation and\n lightness.[14]\n A color is saturated to the extent to\nwhich its hue is intense or vivid: pastels are desaturated, and\nachromatic colors (blacks, whites, and grays) have no saturation.\nColors become lighter as they become less grayish or blackened.\nArranging the colors along these three dimensions produces a color\nsolid, an example of which is shown in figure 5:\n\n\nFigure 5:\n3D color space: the Munsell color solid[15]\n\n\n\n\nThe lightness dimension corresponds to the central vertical axis,\nwith white at the top. The hue and saturation dimensions correspond,\nrespectively, to the angle around the vertical axis, and to the\ndistance from it. Thus the shades of maximum saturation are on the\noutside of the solid. Notice that the yellows have their maximum\nsaturation at higher levels of lightness than the reds and the blues.\nSo, assuming that Invert\u2019s judgments of the relations between colors\nare\u2014modulo the inversion\u2014normal, a possible Lockean\n180\u00b0 hue rotation scenario would be behaviorally detectable. Invert\nwould judge the maximally saturated colors she calls \u2018shades of\nblue\u2019 to be lighter than the maximally saturated colors she calls\n\u2018shades of yellow\u2019. Further, there are more distinguishable\nhue steps between blue and red than there are between yellow and \ngreen\u2014a fact that is reflected in the Munsell space, whose hue circle\nhas five hues equally spaced: red, yellow, green, blue, purple.\n(Contrast the NCS space mentioned in the previous subsection.) Hence\nthe Lockean inversion function \\(I\\), assuming it is defined on\nall hues, would map some distinct hues (in particular, some bluish\nreds) to the same hue (in particular, the same yellowish green). The\nrange of \\(I\\) would therefore contain fewer hues than its domain.\nInvert would not be able to distinguish some stimuli (those she calls\n\u2018bluish red\u2019) that Nonvert could tell apart, and so again\nthe inversion would be behaviorally detectable.\n",
