    "main_text": "The restriction to concrete entities\n4. The restriction to concrete entities\n\nVan Inwagen\u2019s answer is that we are actually interested in\nconcrete things. A grain of sand, a camel, and an oasis are\neach concrete entities. Each is part of the causal order. In contrast,\nabstract entities (numbers, sets, possible worlds) do not cause\nanything. Those who adopt the principle that only causes are real will\nbecome nominalists; everything is concrete.\n\nA second characterization of concrete entities is in terms of\nlocatability; a concrete entity has a position in space or time. Since\nconcrete entities are situated, they have boundaries with their\nenvironment. (The only exception would be an entity that took up all\nspace or all time, say the perfect animal described in Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus.)\n\nAdmittedly, points in space and time have locations. But concrete\nentities are only accidentally where and when they are. All concrete\nentities have intrinsic properties (which make their boundaries\nnatural rather than conventional, say Efird and Stoneham (2005, 314)).\nTheir natures are not exhausted by their relationships with other\nthings. Max Black imagines twin iron spheres in an otherwise empty\nuniverse. The spheres are distinct yet have the same relationships and\nthe same intrinsic properties.\n\nAll material things are concrete but some concrete things might be\nimmaterial. Shadows and holes have locations and durations but they\nare not made of anything material. There is extraneous light in\nshadows and extraneous matter in holes; but these are contaminants\nrather than constituents. Cracks can spread, be counted, and\nconcealed. Once we acknowledge the existence of cracks, we get an\nunexpected transcendental explanation of why there is something:\nIf there is nothing then there is an absence of anything.\nTherefore, there exists something (either a positive concrete entity\nor an absence).\n\nOntological pluralists do not dismiss this proof as sophistry. Kris\nMcDaniel (2013, 277) thinks the proof is trivially correct. To address\na more interesting question, McDaniel follows Aristotle\u2019s\nprinciple that there are many ways of being. From the\npluralist\u2019s perspective, debate over whether holes exist is\nequivocal. The friends of absences use a broad sense of\n\u2018being\u2019. The enemies of holes speak from a higher link in\nthe chain of being. From this altitude, holes depend on their hosts\nand so cannot be as real. Alexius Meinong\u2019s talk of subsistence\nalludes to the lowest level of being. \u201cWhy does anything\nsubsist?\u201d is a perfectly legitimate question, according to\nMcDaniel.\n\nIf there are souls or Cartesian minds, then they will also qualify as\nimmaterial, concrete entities. Although they do not take up space,\nthey take up time. An idealist such as George Berkeley could ask\n\u2018Why is there something rather than nothing?\u2019 even though\nhe was convinced that material things are not possible.\n\nWilliam James denied that his defense of parapsychology provided a\nresource for answering, \u2018How comes the world to be here at all\ninstead of the non-entity which might be imagined in its place?\u2019\nPhilosophy, be it natural or supernatural, can make no progress on\nthis issue \u201cfor from nothing to being there is no logical\nbridge\u201d (1911, 40). James concludes: \u201cThe question of\nbeing is the darkest in all philosophy. All of us are beggars here,\nand no school can speak disdainfully of another or give itself\nsuperior airs\u201d (1911, 46).\n\nAlthough all concrete things are in space or time, neither space nor\ntime are concrete things. Where would space be? When would time occur?\nThese questions can only be answered if space were contained in\nanother higher space. Time would be dated within another time. Since\nthe same questions can be posed for higher order space and higher\norder time, we would face an infinite regress.\n\nThere is no tradition of wondering \u2018Why is there space and\ntime?\u2019. One reason is that space and time seem like a framework\nfor there being any contingent things.\n\nAbsolutists think of the framework as existing independently of what\nit frames. For instance, Newton characterized space as an eternal,\nhomogeneous, three dimensional container of infinite extent. He\nbelieved that the world was empty of objects for an infinite period\nprior to creation (setting aside an omnipresent God). An empty world\nwould merely be a continuation of what creation interrupted.\n\nOthers think the framework depends on what it frames. Like Leibniz,\nAlbert Einstein pictured (or \u201cpictured\u201d) space as an\nabstraction from relations between objects. Consequently, space can be\ndescribed with the same metaphors we use for family trees. Maybe space\ngrows bigger. Maybe space is curved or warped or has holes. There is\nmuch room to wonder why space has the properties that it has. But\nsince space is an abstraction from objects, answers to any riddles\nabout space reduce to questions about objects. One can wonder why\nthere is space. But this is only to wonder why there are objects.\n",
