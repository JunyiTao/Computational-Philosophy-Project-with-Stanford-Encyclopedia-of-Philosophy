    "main_text": "\n\n\nIn the quantum realm, there are curious correlations between the\nproperties of distant systems. An example of such correlations is\nprovided by the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen/Bohm experiment. The\ncorrelations in the EPR/B experiment strongly suggest that there are\nnon-local influences between distant systems, i.e., systems between\nwhich no light signal can travel, and indeed orthodox quantum\nmechanics and its various interpretations postulate the existence of\nsuch non-locality. Yet, the question of whether the EPR/B correlations\nimply non-locality and the exact nature of this non-locality is a\nmatter of ongoing controversy. Focusing on EPR/B-type experiments, in\nthis entry we consider the nature of the various kinds of non-locality\npostulated by different interpretations of quantum mechanics. Based on\nthis consideration, we briefly discuss the compatibility of these\ninterpretations with the special theory of relativity.\n",
