    "main_text": "Epistemology || Knowledge (cognitio)\n3.2 Knowledge (cognitio)\n\nThe common English translation of Spinoza\u2019s cognitio as\n\u201cknowledge\u201d does not do justice to his understanding of the term,\nwhich includes not just true and adequate ideas, but also inadequate\nand false ones.\n3.2.1 Cognition and causation\n\nPerhaps the most important epistemological principle standardly\nascribed to Spinoza is that to conceive of or cognize x, one\nmust conceive of or cognize its causes. The text cited most\nfrequently in support of this causal interpretation of Spinozistic\ncognition is E1ax4: \u201cCognition of an effect depends on, and\ninvolves, cognition of its cause\u201d (transl. altered). The\ninterpretation finds further support in what has come to be known as\nSpinoza\u2019s \u201cparallelism doctrine\u201d, the proposition\nstating that \u201cThe order and connection of ideas is the same as\nthe order and connection of things\u201d (E2p7). Spinoza\u2019s\nappeal to E1ax4 in the demonstration of this proposition makes clear\nthat the \u201corder and connection of things\u201d he has in mind\nin E2p7 is a causal order and connection (cf.\nE2p9d). The idea that at least for the omniscient\n\u201cinfinite intellect\u201d the connections between ideas\nperfectly mirror the causal connections between things in nature\nfurther supports the thought that for Spinoza cognizing something\nrequires tracking its causes.\n\nDespite the fact that commentators often appeal to E1ax4, the meaning\nof this important axiom is far from clear. There are two main\ninterpretive problems (leaving aside the question of what sorts of\ncauses, out of the rich panoply envisioned by the Aristotelians,\nSpinoza might allow in his metaphysics). The first problem concerns\nthe kind of cognition at stake in E1ax4. Some readers (e.g.\nBennett 1984; Gueroult 1969) have proposed that the axiom governs\nadequate cognition alone. So understood, the axiom expresses\na version of the traditional view that truly \u201cscientific\u201d\nknowledge requires a knowledge of causes \u2013 the knowledge\nwhy something happened, not merely that it happened.\nBut, as Margaret Wilson points out (1999: ch.10), this restricted\nreading of the scope of the axiom can\u2019t be correct, since in\nSpinoza\u2019s view even inadequate ideas formed in sense\nexperience \u201cinvolve\u201d their causes. (For example, the\ninadequate knowledge I have of any bodily change\n\u201cinvolves\u201d the inadequate knowledge of its external cause\n[E2ax1\u2019, E2p25, E2p28].)\n\nA second interpretive problem concerns the meaning of the two terms\n\u2013 \u201cdependence\u201d and \u201cinvolvement\u201d \u2013\nused by Spinoza to characterize the relation between causes and\ncognitions in E1ax4. \u201cInvolvement\u201d is most often glossed\nas \u201cimplication\u201d. But Wilson has argued that in key\npassages (e.g. E2p45) involvere stands more specifically for\nthe relation of implication between an attribute concept\n(e.g. extension, thought) and cognition of a mode (1999:\nch.10). On this reading of \u201cinvolvement\u201d, Spinoza\u2019s\nclaim in E1ax4 that cognition of effects \u201cinvolves\u201d a\ncognition of causes amounts to the relatively intuitive claim that\nconceiving of extension or thought is necessary for conceiving of any\nparticular mind or body. So understood, the axiom doesn\u2019t direct\nus to discover the causes of things so that we may have truly\nscientific knowledge of them, but instead merely describes what is\nentailed by even the most minimal and inadequate conception of\nanything whatsoever.\n\nIn addition to E1ax4 and E2p7, the claim that for Spinoza all\ncognition is cognition of causes also fits with his definition of\n\u201cadequate cause\u201d as one \u201cwhose effect can be clearly\nand distinctly perceived through it\u201d (E3def1), which suggests\nthat causes are at least sufficient for adequately conceiving\nof a thing. Likewise, in E1p11altd1, Spinoza appears to\nidentify the \u201ccauses\u201d of a thing\u2019s\nexistence or nonexistence with \u201creasons [ratio]\u201d\nfor that existence or nonexistence by means of the conjunction\nsive.\n\nNonetheless, the claim that for Spinoza to conceive of x, one\nmust conceive of its causes, faces at least two problems.\nFirst, it\u2019s not clear how to reconcile this position with\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the human mind. As we saw (2.2), cognition\nof the essence of human minds requires reference to actually existing\nbodies; yet, given Spinoza\u2019s commitment to the attribute barrier\n(1.2), bodies cannot stand in a causal relation to anything mental. So\neither Spinoza\u2019s account of the human mind is invalid by his own\nlights or (more likely) Spinoza allows for cognitions that do\nnot depend on a thing\u2019s causes. Second, since each\nfinite thing depends on an \u201cinfinite\u201d series of prior\nfinite causes (E1p28), if cognition of a thing (or at least\nadequate cognition of it) requires a grasp of all\nits causes, this would put an implausible, \u201cstratospherically\nhigh\u201d (Bennett 1984) requirement on cognition. Indeed it would\nput such cognition outside the reach of minds like ours, since, as\nSpinoza admits, we simply cannot know the entire infinite series of\nfinite things responsible for any given state of affairs in nature\n(TIE \u00a7100). Here Wilson\u2019s insight about how Spinoza uses\n\u201cinvolvement\u201d is helpful: we can have adequate\ncausal cognition of particular things, as long as we look to God (the\nfirst and universal cause of all things) and not to the infinite\nseries of prior finite things as the relevant cause, and as\nlong as we attempt to explain the essence of the particular,\nnot its durational states. Spinoza\u2019s doctrine of \u201ccommon\nnotions\u201d (see 3.2.3) guarantees that we have adequate ideas of\nGod under the attributes of extension and thought. And to know God as\nthe cause of the essence of a particular thing is just to have what\nSpinoza calls \u201cintuitive cognition\u201d (see 3.2.5.)\n\n(On causal cognition, see e.g. Koistinen 1996, Morrison 2013, 2015; on\nreconciling it with mind-body account, Della Rocca 1996, H\u00fcbner\n2020; on possibility of adequate cognition, e.g. Marshall 2013.)\n3.2.2 Kinds of cognition I: Imagination and falsity\n\nSpinoza divides cognition into three kinds: imagination;\nreason [ratio]; and intuition [scientia intuitiva].\nThis section focuses on the first of these.\n\nFirst, a terminological warning: what Spinoza calls\n\u201cimagination\u201d shouldn\u2019t be confused with what\nwe are likely to mean by that term today. By\nimaginatio Spinoza understands sense experience (including\ncognition from signs and testimony) and derivative mental processes\n(including memory and the sort of manipulation of mental imagery we\nindeed might call \u201cimagination\u201d). Spinozistic\nimaginatio is distinct in virtue of both its content and its\ncauses. First, it is cognition of external bodies as\npresent; secondly, it is cognition acquired through ideas of\naffections, i.e., changes, of our own body, caused by\nother bodies:\n\naffections of the human body whose ideas present external bodies as\npresent to us, we shall call images of things, even if they do not\nreproduce the [NS: external] figures of things. And when the mind\nregards bodies in this way, we shall say that it imagines (E2p17s;\nG/II/106)\n\n\n(NB: \u201cimage\u201d is another potential terminological trap for\ntoday\u2019s readers: it\u2019s Spinoza\u2019s label for something\nphysical, a modification of the body. In contrast,\n\u201cimagination\u201d names something mental: the act or operation\nof representing, or forming ideas of, these physical\n\u201cimages\u201d.)\n\nOne of the most important claims Spinoza makes about imaginative\ncognition is that it comprises \u201call those ideas which are\ninadequate and confused and so\u2026is the only cause of\nfalsity\u201d (E2p41d). That is, only ideas derived from sense\nexperience alone can give rise to false beliefs. The list of\nobjects of which, Spinoza thinks, we have only such inadequate and\nconfused cognition is staggering: it includes our own bodies; external\nbodies; the affections, parts, and durations of both; finally, even\nour minds (E2p19\u201331) (cf. 2.2.1). As Spinoza concludes\npessimistically, \u201call the notions by which ordinary people are\naccustomed to explain nature are only modes of imagining, and do not\nindicate the nature of anything\u201d (E1app; G/II/83).\n\nWhat sort of \u201cconfusion\u201d does Spinoza have in mind in\nE2p41d? Recall that imaginative cognition consists in ideas of\naffections of, or changes in, our own bodies that also\npresent us, indirectly, with the external causes of\nthese changes. (As Spinoza puts it, all our ideas of our own,\nexternally-caused bodily affections \u201cinvolve\u201d the nature\nof the external cause [E2p16].) So the \u201cconfusion\u201d\ninherent to imaginative cognition seems to do, first, with the fact\nthat imaginative ideas have a content that is an amalgam of\ntwo distinct things: the current condition of some part of my body\nand the properties of the external cause (E2p16, E2p25; cf.\nDella Rocca 1996). For example, when I\u2019m warmed by the sun, the\nnature of that bodily change depends on the nature of the sun\ntogether with the nature and current state of my own body. My\nperception of the bodily affection \u2013 of the increased warmth\n\u2013 tells me something about my own body and\nsomething about the sun; I have some insight into the\nrelative properties of both things. But it doesn\u2019t tell\nme about the intrinsic or fundamental nature either of my own body or\nthe sun. It also doesn\u2019t allow me to clearly separate out the\nrelative contributions of the external cause and of my own body.\n(Indeed, Spinoza goes so far as to propose that that such ideas\n\u201cindicate the condition of our own body more\nthan the nature of the external bodies\u201d [E2p16c2;\nemphasis added].)\n\nWhat about Spinoza\u2019s characterization of imaginative ideas as\n\u201cinadequate\u201d (E2p41d)? Recall that \u201cadequate\u201d\nideas are manifestly true ideas fully explained by the\nmind they help constitute (3.1). So, first, a lack of\nadequacy is a lack of an intrinsic marker of truth, and hence of\ncertainty that we are dealing with true ideas. Hence when\ndealing with imaginative ideas we\u2019re not yet able to\n\u201cdistinguish\u201d with certainty \u201cbetween the true and\nthe false\u201d (E2p402). Of course, we may stumble on the right\nresult (as when we correctly apply a memorized mathematical rule\naccepted on authority [cf. E2p40s2]). But we cannot yet be sure that\nour ideas manage to \u201cagree\u201d with, or correspond to,\nreality.\n\nSecond, as inadequate, imaginative ideas won\u2019t fully\nexplain what they purport to be about. Arguably, the mind thinking\nthem won\u2019t possess all of the \u201cpremises\u201d that\nnecessarily conclude in the idea in question. Instead, that idea will\nhave been produced by, and so will \u201cinvolve\u201d, the natures\nof the external causes that brought about the relevant affection of\nthe body. Instead of being orderly connected to all their premises in\nthe mind (according to what Spinoza calls the \u201corder of the\nintellect\u201d), imaginative ideas will be connected to one another\naccording to the \u201ccommon order of Nature\u201d (E2p29s), that\nis in a way that reflects the order of our happenstance encounters\nwith other bodies, and the idiosyncratic psychological associations\nsuch encounters generate:\n\nFor example, a soldier, having seen traces of a horse in the sand,\nwill immediately pass from the thought of a horse to the thought of a\nhorseman, and from that to the thought of war, etc. But a Farmer will\npass from the thought of a horse to the thought of a plow, and then to\nthat of a field, etc. And so each one, according as he has been\naccustomed to join and connect the images of things in this or that\nway, will pass from one thought to another. (E2p18s)\n\n\nIt is fairly easy to see how ideas whose premises are only partially\ngrasped, and which are haphazardly connected together, could become a\n\u201ccause of falsity\u201d \u2013 that is, could easily generate\nerroneous inferences and associations, as long as we have not yet\ngrasped ideas that would be needed to offset or \u201cexclude\u201d\n(see 2.4) such erroneous inferences and associations:\n\nthe mind does not err from the fact that it imagines, but only insofar\nas it is considered to lack an idea which excludes the existence of\nthose things which it imagines to be present to it (E2p17s)\n\n\nTo take an example important for the history of philosophy, our belief\nin free will, on Spinoza\u2019s analysis, is precisely a false belief\nthat follows from sense experience not offset by countervailing ideas:\nit arises because \u201cwe are conscious of [our] actions and\nignorant of [their] causes\u201d (E2p35s). Any perception of my own\naction will be \u201cinadequate\u201d (i.e., merely partial or\n\u201cmutilated\u201d by comparison to God\u2019s infallible idea\nof that same action) if the ideas of all the necessitating causes of\nthat action are not also part of my mind. Such a\n\u201cmutilated\u201d and \u201cinadequate\u201d idea of my own\naction can generate a false belief in free will as long as I lack\npotentially offsetting ideas \u2013 say, of the general\nnecessity of all actions in nature (e.g. E1p33), together with an\nunderstanding of myself as subject to the very same laws as\nany other natural thing (E3pref; G/II/138).\n\nThis picture of falsehood as the result of the confusion and\nmutilation of ideas generated by sense experience, combined with the\nabsence of countervailing ideas, is behind Spinoza\u2019s claim that\n\u201cfalsity\u201d is \u201cnothing positive\u201d, only a\nrelative \u201cprivation of knowledge\u201d (E2p35) about the matter\nat hand. (Falsity so understood must also be distinguished from an\n\u201cabsolute\u201d \u201cignorance\u201d of something\n[E2p35d].)\n\nThe lack of ideas that could exclude or offset false conclusions\ncarries another epistemic danger, and contributes to the loss of our\n\u201cpower\u201d to think in yet another way: any ideas we have\nfailed to exclude lie in the mind ready to be combined with any\nadequate ideas we\u2019ve managed to secure, thereby\nundermining the epistemic good that the latter bring with them. For\nexample, if we have not yet excluded the ideas of divine\ngoodness or divine purposiveness from our\nminds (see E1app), we can easily \u201cjoin\u201d such inadequate\nideas to the concept God.\n3.2.3 Kinds of cognition II: Intellect, common notions and reason\n\nSpinoza contrasts confused and falsehood-inviting imagination with\n\u201cintellect\u201d, which he subdivides further into\n\u201creason\u201d and \u201cintuition\u201d. Given\nSpinoza\u2019s bundle-theoretic approach to minds (2.1.1), talk of\n\u201cintellect\u201d is not intended to conjure up here some sort\nof mental \u201cfaculty\u201d over and above particular ideas.\n\u201cIntellect\u201d is instead Spinoza\u2019s name for a certain\ntype of cognition, namely cognition that is \u201cnecessarily\ntrue\u201d (E2p41). That is, intellectual ideas necessarily\n\u201cagree\u201d with, or correspond to, represented objects\n(E1ax6; see 3.1). This \u201cagreement\u201d with how things really\nare in the world allows intellectual ideas to both be \u201cthe same\nin all men\u201d (E2p18s), and to reflect the actual causal order of\nthings in nature. Hence Spinoza can also describe intellect as\ncognition of things \u201cthrough their first causes\u201d (E2p18s,\ncf. E2p7), that is, ultimately through the all-necessitating divine\nessence that determines the causal order of things (E1p15, E1p16).\nIntellectual ideas are also \u201cadequate\u201d (E2p41d), that is,\nmanifestly true and fully explained by the mind they help constitute\n(3.1). Because intellectual ideas of truth and falsity in particular\nare manifestly true, intellectual cognition enables us to\n\u201cdistinguish the true from the false\u201d with certainty\n(E2p42).\n\nSo how do we get our hands on this cornucopia of epistemic goods?\nSpinoza warns that \u201cideas which are clear and distinct in\nus\u201d (i.e., \u201cadequate\u201d, or manifestly true, ideas)\n\u201ccannot follow from mutilated and confused ideas\u201d\n(E5p28d; emphasis added). This would seem to preclude any\npossibility of progressing from imagination to intellect. Fortunately\nSpinoza leaves an escape hatch in the form of \u201ccommon\nnotions\u201d, which he calls, appropriately, the\n\u201cfoundations\u201d of reason, i.e., of the first of two kinds of\nintellectual cognition (E2p40s1). We may not be able to generate clear\nand distinct ideas from confused ideas, but not all is yet\nlost, because according to Spinoza even brute sense experience\nfurnishes us with some necessarily true and adequate ideas\n(or, on innatist readings [see 3.1], triggers or activates such\nideas).\n\nMore precisely, in Spinoza\u2019s view, in every encounter with\nanother thing, not matter how confused my ideas of both my own body\nand the external body (3.2.2), I also form necessarily\nadequate ideas of any properties that are both 1)\n\u201ccommon\u201d to the interacting bodies and 2) \u201cequally\nin the part and in the whole\u201d (E2p38). That is, I form\nnecessarily adequate ideas of any properties wholly and without\ndistinction present in each particular thing. For example, the\nproperty of being extended is one such property: extension is\nextension is extension, whether it belongs to me or to a mosquito\nbiting me; I am neither more nor less of a physical thing than a\nmosquito is. Likewise, every body possesses the property of having a\ncapacity for \u201cmotion and rest\u201d (\u201call bodies\nagree\u2026in that they can move now more slowly, now more quickly,\nand that now they move, now they are at rest\u201d [E2Ld]). For\nSpinoza, all such properties that are both universally instantiated\n(\u201ccommon\u201d to all things) and non scalar (\u201cequally in\nthe part and in the whole\u201d) are necessarily grasped correctly by\nany mind. And all ideas of such properties \u2013 all\n\u201ccommon notions\u201d \u2013 are necessarily adequate.\n\nWhat is Spinoza\u2019s argument for this rather implausible claim,\nthat we simply cannot get certain properties (such as extension,\nthought, motion and rest) wrong? As we have seen, a lot\nhinges on this doctrine: nothing less than the very possibility of\nintellectual emendation, of transcending the confusion and inadequacy\nof mere imagination. The answer has to do with how Spinoza thinks\nabout what is responsible for the absence of adequacy. As we\nsaw above (3.2.2), in his view, any ideas of external bodies that I\nform through mere sense experience will in fact be ideas of how those\nbodies affect me. (For example, my empirical idea of the sun\nin fact only represents one way the sun can affect my body in its\ncurrent state.) But common properties like extension are\n\u201cequally in the part and in the whole\u201d: wholly and without\ndistinction in each thing. So for the adequacy of my idea of the sun\nas extended it does not matter if I\u2019m representing\nextension as it is in the sun, or as it is in my body, or as it is in\nthe \u201cconfused\u201d amalgam of the two. Extension is extension\nis extension. Because common notions are insulated against error in\nthis way, and because no idea inferable from an adequate idea can\nitself be inadequate (E2p40), these notions can indeed form a\n\u201cfoundation\u201d of reasoning, and so be our entry point into\nthe realm of the intellect.\n\nWhat is sometimes overlooked in discussions of common notions is that\nSpinoza allows for two kinds of common notions: what we could\ncall 1) universal common notions, notions of truly\nuniversally instantiated non-scalar properties, such as extension; and\n2) relative common notions, ideas of properties \u201ccommon\nto, and peculiar to [proprium], the human body and certain\nexternal bodies by which the human Body is usually affected\n[affici solet], and is equally in the part and in the whole\nof each of them\u201d (E2p39). It\u2019s not obvious what to make of\nthis characterization of the second type of common notion. What counts\nas being \u201cpeculiar\u201d to what \u201cusually\u201d affects\nus? For example, are the general ideas Spinoza relies on in his\naccount of the human mind and human emotions (\u201caffects\u201d)\ncommon notions in this more circumscribed sense? We could pose the\nsame question of universal common notions: what should we\ninclude in that list, beyond the fairly uncontroversial examples of\nextension, thought, motion-and-rest?\n\nOne interesting upshot of Spinoza allowing for this second, relative\ntype of common notion is that our ability to transcend mere sense\nexperience into the realm of reason is not simply a function of the\ninvariable ontological make-up of the world, of there being only so\nmany truly universal on/off properties. We can also do\nsomething to increase the number of common notions that it is possible\nfor beings like us to have given our \u201cusual\u201d environments.\nThe more we can make it the case that we have something in common with\nthings around us \u2013 and in part this means, the more diverse\nwe ourselves are (cf. Sharp 2011: 98\u20139) \u2013 the\nbroader the epistemic \u201cfoundation\u201d on which we can rely in\nreasoning.\n\nFinally, once again, the fact that no common notion on its\nown can be a cause of falsity doesn\u2019t mean that we cannot\nput common notions, of either kind, to bad use: we can still\n\u201cjoin\u201d adequate ideas to ideas of more dubious value,\nproducing more complex inadequate representations (cf.\n3.2.2). Hence even if we necessarily adequately conceive of God as\na thinking thing, we still are in danger of joining this adequate\nidea to that of a benign or vengeful ruler as the referent of the name\nGod.\n\n(On reason, see e.g. Kisner 2011; LeBuffe 2017, Malinowski-Charles\n2010; on common notions, Donagan 1988; Primus 2017.)\n3.2.4 Generality and abstraction\n\nSpinoza\u2019s doctrine of common notions is inseparable from a\nlarger interpretative puzzle. This puzzle concerns Spinoza\u2019s\nstance on the validity of general concepts more broadly\n\u2013 in particular, of concepts of kinds, such as horse,\nanimal, or being.\n\nCertain things are fairly clear. For example, it\u2019s clear that in\nhis ontology, Spinoza is committed to the existence of particulars\nalone (that is, roughly, things that cannot exist in many places at\nthe same time). It is also clear that, in his view, conceptual\ngenerality \u2013 and in particular the operation of\nabstracting from particulars \u2013 are rife with the\npossibility of error. (For example, we can be led to overlook\ndifferences among particulars [TIE \u00a776], or mistake the products\nof our own abstraction for \u201creal beings\u201d, when in fact the\nresulting ideas present only mind-dependent \u201cbeings of\nreason\u201d [Metaphysical Thoughts [= CM]\n1.1; TIE \u00a793]). Finally, it\u2019s also clear that for Spinoza\nideas of universals and abstractions often have lower\nepistemic value than ideas of particulars (e.g. TIE \u00a793).\n\nThese considerations have led some readers to take Spinoza to reject\nall general and abstract ideas as inadequate (e.g. Curley\n1973; Savan 1958). Such readings have trouble explaining\nSpinoza\u2019s own reliance on words that seem to refer to general\nconcepts (such as mode, idea, body, etc.). In particular,\nmany of Spinoza\u2019s moral and socio-political doctrines \u2013\nand so the whole enterprise of the Ethics (see 1.4) \u2013\nseem to hinge on the validity of the general idea of \u201chuman\nnature\u201d. Spinoza seems to believe that human beings share an\nessential nature, even if they realize it to different degrees, and\nhence also a common good. Here is a representative passage:\n\nthe greatest good of those who seek virtue is to know God,\ni.e.\u2026a good that is common to all men, and can be possessed\nequally by all men insofar as they are of the same nature (E4p36d; cf.\nE4p35, E4AppIX)\n\n\nOne interpretative option here is to conclude that for Spinoza general\nand abstract ideas such as \u201chuman nature\u201d have only some\npragmatic value (cf. Carriero 2005). Spinoza clearly\nrecognizes usefulness as an epistemic good (for example, he describes\nAristotelian ideas of genera and species as handy mnemonic devices\n[CM1.1]). On such a reading, it might not be strictly speaking true\nthat there is a common human nature, instantiated by each particular\nhuman being; nonetheless, for ethical or political ends it might be\nuseful to invoke such an idea. But even this reading will have trouble\nexplaining how Spinoza can nonetheless insist that the \u201ctrue\nknowledge we have of good and evil\u201d \u2013 again, hardly a\nminor issue for an Ethics \u2013 is \u201cabstract,\nor universal\u201d (E4p62s; G/II/257).\n\nIt helps to be precise about the nature of Spinoza\u2019s\ncriticisms of general and abstract ideas: falling short of an\nepistemic ideal is not the same as utter inadequacy. Likewise,\nmind-dependence is not the same as illusion or error. (Neither Leibniz\nnor Kant, for example, would want to say that the idea or form of\nspace is an error or an illusion.) Finally, Spinoza\u2019s most\nextensive criticism of general ideas, in E2p40s2, is not a criticism\nof general ideas simpliciter, but only of most general ideas\nderived from sense experience (cf. Bennett 1984). In Spinoza\u2019s\nview, as finite and embodied beings whose minds are essentially ideas\nof what happens to our bodies (2.2.1), we can\u2019t avoid\nthinking in general terms. When our bodies interact with other bodies\n\u2013 when we smell roses, or stub our toes \u2013 these encounters\nleave impressions (\u201cimages\u201d) on our bodies; the finitude\nof our bodies allows them to retain only a limited number of\ndistinct \u201cimages\u201d since over time they get\noverlaid and confused. The ideas we form by thinking the resulting\ncomposite \u201cimages\u201d, and then predicate of indefinitely\nmany other entities \u2013 ideas such as horse,\nanimal, or being \u2013 represent distinctly only\nwhat the bodies we happen to come across have in common insofar as\nthey can affect a human body. General ideas formed in this way are\njust as \u201cconfused\u201d, inadequate and idiosyncratic, as any\nother imaginative idea (see 3.2.2). So, contrary to what the\nAristotelians held, sense experience doesn\u2019t suffice\nfor true ideas of the essences of things. (Rather it gives rise to\nunending philosophical controversies, as each one of us fashions\ngeneral types according to what we have experienced.)\n\nMoreover, we also can\u2019t forget that, as we know from our\ndiscussion of common notions (3.2.3), Spinoza doesn\u2019t think that\nall general ideas grounded in sense experience alone result\nin confused representations. Indeed, beyond this foundational\nsphere of common notions, Spinoza seems to think of\n\u201creason\u201d on the whole as a necessarily adequate\nway of forming general ideas:\n\nit is clear that we perceive many things and form universal\nnotions: I. from singular things which have been\nrepresented to us through the senses\u2026 II. from\nsigns\u2026 These two ways of regarding things I shall henceforth\ncall knowledge of the first kind, opinion or imagination. III.\nFinally, from the fact that we have common notions and adequate\nideas of the properties of things\u2026This I shall call reason\nand the second kind of knowledge (E2p40s2; emphases added)\n\n\nIn other words, for Spinoza both (confused and inadequate) imagination\nand (necessarily adequate) reason are ways of forming general ideas;\nwhat distinguishes reason and imagination is in part the epistemic\nvalue of their respective \u201cuniversal notions\u201d. The general\nideas that belong to imagination are, as we have seen, confused and\ninadequate and can lead us into error (3.2.2). The general ideas that\nbelong to reason \u2013 in particular, common notions and their\nderivatives \u2013 are, like all ideas of reason, necessarily\nadequate (3.2.3). The question that remains is whether Spinoza\nrecognizes any other rational and general \u201cadequate ideas of\nproperties\u201d beyond those implied by common notions.\n\n(See also e.g. Newlands 2015, H\u00fcbner 2016.)\n3.2.5 Kinds of cognition III: Intuition\n\nSpinoza characterizes scientia intuitiva as the kind of\ncognition that \u201cproceeds from an adequate idea of the formal\nessence of certain attributes of God to the adequate knowledge of the\n[NS: formal] essence of things\u201d (E2p40s2). Given Spinoza\u2019s\nclaim that only infinite things can follow from infinite things\n(E1p21\u201323), it seems that the \u201cformal essences\u201d of\nparticular things that intuition infers from the essences of divine\nattributes must themselves be infinite (D. Garrett 2018:ch.7).\n\nAs noted above (3.2.3), Spinoza classifies intuition, alongside\nreason, as intellectual rather than imaginative cognition. As such,\nintuition is \u201cnecessarily true\u201d (E2p41); allows us to\n\u201cdistinguish the true from the false\u201d (E2p42); is\n\u201cthe same in all men\u201d (E2p18s); and is cognition of things\n\u201cthrough their first causes\u201d (E2p18s). Yet intuition also\nclearly exceeds reason as an epistemic achievement in\nSpinoza\u2019s eyes: it is intuition and not reason that he describes\nas \u201cthe greatest virtue of the mind\u201d (E5p25) and the\n\u201cgreatest human perfection\u201d (E5p27d), capable of affecting\nthe mind with a unique degree of force (E5p36s). Intuition is also the\nonly cognition on which Spinoza bestows the traditional honorific of\n\u201cscientia\u201d (D. Garrett 2018:ch.7).\n\nWhat is responsible for this singular place of intuition? Commentators\nare divided. Some (e.g. Soyarslan 2016) propose that it allows us to\nknow truths that reason doesn\u2019t. Others (e.g. Nadler 2003) think\nintuition is superior to reason as an epistemic method alone.\nThis latter interpretation is a natural way to understand\nSpinoza\u2019s own mathematical illustration of the ways all\nkinds of cognition, from imagination to intuition, can achieve the\nsame correct result (E2p40s2). Likewise, as many of Spinoza\u2019s\npredecessors have also held, intuition is an immediate\nknowledge, an insight \u201cin one glance\u201d (E2p40s2) into\nessences. The principal superiority of intuition seems to stem from\nthe fact that it is in the business of cognizing essences\ndirectly, without the mediation of ideas of mere properties\nof things, whether \u201ccommon\u201d properties or other\n\u201cadequate ideas of properties\u201d, which form, as we have\nseen, the foundations of reason (3.2.3).\n\n(See also e.g. Carriero 2020, Primus 2017, Wilson 1999: ch.11.)\n4. Eternity of the mind\n\nSpinoza\u2019s doctrine of the eternity of the mind, one of last\nsubjects of the Ethics, has occasioned some of the most\nimpatient and uncharitable comments on the part of his readers (most\nfamously perhaps, Bennett 1984 describes it as \u201crubbish\u201d\nleading others to write rubbish). The cause for this impatience is\nSpinoza\u2019s declaration that in Part 5 he will discuss \u201cthe\nmind\u2019s duration without relation to the body\u201d (E5p20s), a\ndeclaration some see as a blatant violation of his commitment to\nmind-body identity in Part 2 (E2p7s). But of course an identity of one\nthing with another doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility of\ndiscussing one but not the other, a procedure in which\nSpinoza engages again and again (for example, in introducing the\npossibility of ideas of ideas [see 2.3]). Spinoza is moreover quite\nexplicit that there is no eternity of human minds without a\ncorresponding eternity of bodies, and, far from contradicting any\ncommitments about mind-body relations made in Part 2, the doctrine of\nthe eternity of the mind in Part 5 arguably brings to light the full\nmeaning of those earlier commitments.\n\nTo recall (2.2.1), in Part 2 Spinoza proposes that the \u201cfirst\nthing\u201d that constitutes this \u201cactual being\u201d of a\nhuman mind is an idea of an \u201cactually exist[ing]\u201d body\n(E2p11\u201313). Only in Part 5 does Spinoza clarify that\n\u201cactual\u201d being or existence can be understood in two ways:\nfirst, in the temporal or durational sense key to the claims made in\nPart 2, and second, in an atemporal or purely ontological sense of\nsimply having being or reality at all (as opposed to, for example,\nbeing merely possible):\n\nWe conceive things as actual in two ways: either insofar as we\nconceive them to exist in relation to a certain time and place, or\ninsofar as we conceive them to be contained in God and to follow from\nthe necessity of the divine nature. But the things we conceive in this\nsecond way as true, or real, we conceive under a species of\neternity (E5p29s)\n\n\nGiven these two senses of \u201cactuality\u201d, Spinoza\u2019s\noriginal claim in Part 2 that the \u201cactual being\u201d of the\nhuman mind is an idea of an \u201cactually exist[ing]\u201d body can\nalso be understood in two ways. First, it can be understood as a claim\nabout what it takes for a human mind to begin existing in\ntime, as we have done in 2.2.1: any human mind starts to\nactually exist in a durational sense when the nexus of bodily causes\nin nature generates a new body, which then begins to be variously\naffected or changed by external causes. The infinite intellect, in its\nindefatigable omniscience, begins to represent these affections or\nchanges. The relevant \u201cpart\u201d of God\u2019s omniscient\nidea (see 2.1.2) is a new, temporally existing human mind. More\nplainly put, a human \u201cinfant\u201d is born, with \u201ca body\ncapable of very few things, and\u2026a mind\u2026conscious of\nalmost nothing\u201d (E5p39s).\n\nThis is the first, more intuitive sense in which human minds can be\nsaid to \u201cactually exist\u201d, the sense in which your mind\nexists now when processing these words. But however much we may be\nattached to our temporal selves and all that they feel, for Spinoza\nthere is another sense of \u201cactual existence\u201d. In that\nsecond sense, a human mind is still essentially an \u201cactually\nexisting\u201d idea of a certain \u201cactually existing\u201d bit\nof extension. But the relevant bit of extension is not the living\nhuman body, but its eternal essence \u2013 a certain\neternally possible way that divine extension can modify itself to take\non a certain ratio of motion and rest (cf. E2def[8]; G/II/100), i.e., a\ncertain determinate functional pattern of physical activity. In its\nomniscience, the divine substance eternally understands itself as\nbeing capable of being modified in such more determinate ways \u2013\nthat is, of manifesting its own physical being as this or that snail\nor sunflower or human infant. Ideas of these eternal bodily\nessences are eternal \u201cparts\u201d of substance\u2019s\ninfinite intellect (E2p8). That is, for each bodily essence there is a\ndivine idea that \u201cexpresses the essence of the body under a\nspecies of eternity\u201d (E5p23s), as an eternal part of the\ninfinite intellect.\n\nThe eternal idea of a bodily essence is not only a part of God\u2019s\nintellect (as all ideas are), it is also an eternal \u201cpart\u201d\nof the relevant human mind, a \u201cpart\u201d that\n\u201cremains\u201d (E5p23) even after the body\u2019s demise, when\nthere are no more ideas of bodily affections to be \u201cfelt\u201d.\nThis then is all there is also to human immortality, in\nSpinoza\u2019s view: the eternal existence of the essences of our\nbodies, and of ideas of those bodies. As Nadler emphasizes (2002), we\nare far here from any traditional doctrine of personal immortality:\nnothing that does not belong to us essentially, and nothing that\ndepends on sense experience, such as memories, persists beyond\ndeath.\n\nSpinoza attaches an epistemic challenge to this ontological\npicture. He writes that we always \u201cunderstand\u201d and\n\u201cfeel\u201d \u201cthat we are eternal\u201d (E5p23s):\npresumably this means that we have some joyful, i.e., empowering\n(E3p11d), intellectual grasp of our own eternity (even if we often\njoin these adequate ideas with inadequate ones [see 3.2.2], such as\nreward or punishment). But he also suggests, prima\nfacie puzzlingly, that we can increase the degree of our own\neternity: \u201cthe more the mind understands things by the second\nand third kind of cognition, the greater the part [maxima\npars] of it that remains\u201d after the destruction of the body\n(E5p38d). This suggestion might seem puzzling if we assume that the\n\u201ceternal part\u201d of my mind is just the eternal\nidea of the eternal essence of my own body. For then there\nseems to be nothing that would be subject to improvement or\nenlargement: my eternal essence just is my eternal essence.\n\nBut arguably this is not how Spinoza understands the eternal part of\nthe mind. The idea of the eternal essence of the body is just the\n\u201cfirst thing [primum]\u201d (cf. E2p11) that grounds\nmy mind\u2019s eternal existence: it is the foundation of\neternal ideas of other things, just as the durational idea of this\nbody as changing is the foundation of imaginative ideas of other\nthings. \u201c[T]he Mind is eternal, insofar as it conceives things\nunder a species of eternity\u201d (E5p31s). Since for Spinoza any\nhuman mind is essentially an idea of a certain \u201cactually\nexisting\u201d body, cognition of that body is the foundation of\nall cognition whatsoever. This is true whether we are talking\nabout imaginative cognition of the external bodies we bump up against\nin duration; or about intellectual cognition of eternally existing\nessences: \u201cWhatever the mind understands under a species of\neternity, it understands\u2026from the fact that it conceives the\nbody\u2019s essence under a species of eternity\u201d (E5p29). In\nshort, for Spinoza all cognition of eternal truths rests on a\ncognition of our own body as an eternal essence. We can thus\nunderstand the idea of enlarging or maximizing the eternal\n\u201cpart\u201d of our minds in terms of the number of eternal\ntruths, intuitive and rational, that we can acquire in the course of\nour existence \u2013 or, as on innatist readings (see 3.1), the\nnumber of eternal truths that we can make into powerful\n\u201cparts\u201d of our minds.\n\n(On consciousness, see 2.3; on imaginative cognition of the body see\n2.2 and 3.2.2.
