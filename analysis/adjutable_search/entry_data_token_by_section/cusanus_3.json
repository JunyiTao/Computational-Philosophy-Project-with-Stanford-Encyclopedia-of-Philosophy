    "main_text": "Nicholas\u2019 Thought || The Mind and Human Knowing\n2.2 The Mind and Human Knowing\n\nNicholas of Cusa does not neatly divide ontology from epistemology any\nmore than he separates faith and reason, so it seems fitting that his\nideas on human knowing emphasize the metaphor of mind as measure\n(mens/mensura) already mentioned in On Learned\nIgnorance. This becomes the significant way that human minds are\nimages of the divine mind. In his 1450 dialogue, Idiota de mente:\nThe Layman: About Mind, the first \u201cdefinition\u201d\nproposed for mind may fit the divine mind better than the human:\n\u201cMind is the limit and measure of all things\u201d (c.1).\nCusanus proceeds to employ the quasi-technical metaphor from On\nLearned Ignorance,\n\u201cenfolding/unfolding\u2014complicatio/explicatio,\u201d\nto spell out just how our minds are images of God\u2019s mind. These\nmoves already separate his ideas about human knowing from those of\nboth his scholastic predecessors and his post-Renaissance successors.\nHe writes:\n\nYou know how the divine Simplicity enfolds all things. Mind is the\nimage of this enfolding Simplicity. If, then, you called this divine\nSimplicity infinite Mind, it will be the exemplar of our mind. If you\ncalled the divine mind the totality of the truth of things, you will\ncall our mind the totality of the assimilation of things, so that it\nmay be a totality of ideas. In the divine Mind conception is the\nproduction of things; in our mind conception is the knowledge of\nthings. If the divine Mind is absolute Being, then its conception is\nthe creation of beings; and conception in the human mind is the\nassimilation of beings. (c.3)\n\n\nThis extension of the metaphor used in metaphysics to capture how\nthings simultaneously proceed from and return to God spells out where\nhuman knowledge stands. God\u2019s utterly simple divine mind enfolds\nthe true natures of all the actual things \u201cunfolded\u201d from\nit in the created universe. The human mind is a parallel though\nlimited oneness that can enfold or encompass the concepts of all it\nknows while unfolding them in a conceptual universe. While divine\nknowing amounts to the creating of beings, human knowing amounts to\nthe creating of concepts that are \u201cthe assimilation of\nbeings.\u201d The idiota/layman continues:\n\nWhat suits the divine Mind as infinite Truth suits our mind as its\nclose image. If all things are in the divine Mind as in their exact\nand proper Truth, all things are in our mind as in the image or\nlikeness of their proper Truth, that is, as known; for knowledge takes\nplace by likeness. All things are in God, but there as exemplars of\nthings. All things are in our mind, but there as likenesses of things.\n(c.3)\n\n\nTwo points here are essential. First, the conceptual content of our\nknowledge is tied to the things God created as to their epistemic\nlikenesses. Nicholas thus stands in the tradition of Christian\nrealism. Second, the correspondences between divine mind and human\nmind are severely modified by the fact that God\u2019s purported\n\u201cconcepts,\u201d the \u201cexemplars\u201d of things, are\nreally nothing else in God but God\u2019s undifferentiated oneness.\nOneness is primary in God\u2019s knowledge, \u201cmanyness\u201d\nand \u201cotherness\u201d characterize our conceptual domain. At\nbest we humans are unitary sources of our own knowledge and can give\nour ideas an overall oneness as a more or less organized whole\u2014a\nquite imperfect and faint mirroring of God\u2019s mind.\n2.2.1 Human Knowing is Conjecturing\n\nNicholas\u2019 second major treatise (1442\u201343) that again\nexplains his vision of all there is in Neoplatonic Christian terms is\nentitled De coniecturis: On Conjectures. Here he employs the\ncontrasting terms of unitas/alteritas: oneness/otherness, as\nwell as enfolding/unfolding to propose how we might understand from a\nsomewhat different viewpoint God, the universe and human beings.\nOneness is characteristic of God, while otherness stands for the\ncontingent plurality and variety of limited created things. In this\nwork Nicholas also introduces an explicit contrast between the human\ncapacities of ratio and intellectus. Ratio\nor discursive reason is our capacity for thinking, using concepts and\njudgments. Intellectus, by contrast, is a direct intellectual\nvision. Nicholas parallels the way our plural capacities for reason,\nimagination and sensation are founded in \u201cintellectus\u201d as\ntheir single source to the simultaneous outflow and return of the\nplurality of creatures to their single divine Source. (Ratio\nand intellectus may recall in some ways dianoia and\nnoesis in Plato\u2019s famous image of the divided\nline.)\n\nThe title, On Conjectures, is also intriguing because here\nCusanus makes explicit the limits of human knowing only hinted at in\nOn Learned Ignorance and in his later The Layman: On\nMind. As his Prologue puts it, \u201cYou have seen that the\nexactness of truth cannot be attained. The consequence is that every\npositive human assertion of the truth is a conjecture\u2026. And so\nthe unattainable Oneness of truth is known in conjectural otherness\nand the conjecture of otherness is itself known in the most simple\nOneness of truth.\u201d Here the Neoplatonic dialectical principle\nthat insists we never think anything apart from the First is applied\neven to human knowing. And such knowing is conjecturing.\n\nCusan \u201cconjecture\u201d is not to be taken as what we normally\nmean by the word in contemporary English where it covers the range\nfrom a guess or hunch to a typical surmise to a provisional proposal\nto be investigated or checked against usually empirical evidence.\nNicholas only considers \u201ctrue\u201d conjectures and believes\nthat our conceptual and judgmental knowledge is conjectural or\nprovisional because human reason never grasps the essence of anything\nprecisely as it is. This does not mean we cannot improve our\nunderstanding or that we are simply making things up; rather, it\nfollows from the fact that our knowledge is a likeness of actual\nthings and real characteristics whose complete and \u201ctrue\u201d\nnatures are only known to their Creator. To quote the Prologue again,\n\u201cwhile our actual knowledge is incommensurable with the greatest\nknowledge, something humanly unattainable, the unsure falling away of\nour weak apprehension from the purity of truth makes our assertions of\nwhat is true conjecture.\u201d\n\nNicholas composed On Conjectures as a letter treatise\naddressed to Cardinal Cesarini. In chapter 11 of Book One he proposes\na scenario where the cardinal views the pope. This scenario leads into\nhis sole explicit description of coniectura. This example of\nvisual perception lets us recognize that we readily make perceptual\nassertions about what we see or hear. And when we reflect on these\nperceptual judgments we realize that we go beyond what sensation alone\ndelivers, for we use reason to interpret and make sense of what we\nsee. Reason and sense operate inseparably in our perceptual\nexperience. Reason discriminates, recognizes and may explicitly\nformulate in language or thought what the experience comes to, for\ninstance, \u201cThere\u2019s the pope.\u201d\n\nFurther reflection enables us to realize that what visual perception\ndelivers is limited, that is, partial and perspectival, because our\nperceptual judgments reflect at least the constraints of the\nperceiver\u2019s bodiliness. These constraints include what physical\neyes can see, as well as one\u2019s physical location and viewpoint.\nNicholas terms this a twofold \u201cotherness\u201d that conditions\nand limits all sensory perception, limitations that we are implicitly\naware of in making perceptual judgments. So Nicholas\u2019\ndescription of coniectura reflects the\n\u201cotherness\u201d of our finite human estate. As he writes,\n\u201cA conjecture, then, is a positive assertion that participates\nin truth as it is, but in otherness.\u201d (Bk. I, c. 11)\n\u201cTruth as it is\u201d refers, of course, to what is enfolded in\nthe divine Mind. What is unfolded in our concepts and assertions\nshares that truth but only approximately, \u201cin\notherness.\u201d\n\nTwo other sources of \u201cotherness\u201d besides bodiliness\nunderlie the limitations on perceptual knowledge. One is the fact that\nthe objects of perception are themselves limited. The cardinal\u2019s\nsight of the pope has to be conjectural because anything extended can\nshow, as it were, but one side of itself to another embodied viewer. A\nsecond \u201cotherness\u201d in perception is due to the\n\u201cotherness\u201d of the mental and linguistic signs, images,\nand symbols we use to think and talk about what we perceive. These\ndiffer from both our mental capacities and what we are looking at or\nlistening to. This means the terms in which perceptual judgments are\nexpressed reflect the broader historical background and interests of\nthe perceiver as well as his or her linguistic community.\n\nGiven all these constraints we may wonder why Nicholas believes that\nconjectural knowledge \u201cparticipates in the truth as it\nis.\u201d Fundamentally, he is convinced that our status as images of\nGod\u2019s mind and its oneness secures the cognitive validity of\nwhat we know. Our knowledge is \u201cconjectural\u201d in contrast\nto God\u2019s knowledge, for divine knowledge is complete and exact,\nboth aperspectival and omniperspectival, where knower and known\ncoincide in infinite Oneness. Our recognition of the limits in our own\nknowing and its contents can keep us in touch, at least implicitly,\nwith what is beyond our ken in that ideal oneness of knower and known.\nThe separation of the human mind from the universe of knowable things\nis at the same time a connection that results in conjectural\nknowledge. Just so, conjectural knowledge is also an outcome of the\nseparation and connection of the human mind and the divine Mind, of\nimage and Original.\n2.2.2 Knowing as Assimilative Measuring\n\nRecall once more the Cusan \u201cdefinition\u201d of mind already\nalluded to in The Layman: About Mind: Mind is \u201cthat\nfrom which comes the limit and measure of all things.\u201d (c.1) If\nwe set this beside the comment quoted above that \u201cconception in\nthe human mind is the assimilation of beings,\u201d it is clear that\n\u201cassimilating\u201d and \u201cmeasuring\u201d are the\ndominant metaphors Nicholas uses to understand what we do as knowers.\nAs knowers we measure the things we know and we also are\nassimilated or likened in some way to the objects of\nknowledge. Along with the \u201chorizontal\u201d notion of our\nconcepts being images of things as well as of the mind\u2019s own\noneness, assimilatio also has a \u201cvertical\u201d\ndimension because in knowing we liken ourselves to our divine\nOriginal.\n\nWhat is at issue is the connection and tension between the two\nmetaphors. Supposedly complementary, assimilatio and\nmensura give no obvious answer to what provides the measure\nfor the content and validity of our knowledge\u2014is it the things\nknown or our knowing minds? Nicholas never questioned that the varied\nthings we discover in the natural universe and fashion ourselves in\nthe social and cultural milieu exist independently of our minds (if\nnot of God\u2019s). But the question here is whether our knowledge is\nderived from what is independent of mind or is in whole or part the\nresult of the linguistic and conceptual measures we learn, construct\nand employ in dealing with reality. If knowing is creative or\nproductive, solely a matter of our \u201cmeasuring,\u201d it is easy\nto see how it is an image of God\u2019s creating, but not how it is a\nlikening to extra-mental things. If things outside measure and cause\nwhat we know, we can see why human knowledge is a likening to things,\nbut not how it is an image of God\u2019s creative mind. The two\nmetaphors may well run counter to each other.\n\nBecause Nicholas himself does not frame the question in this way, he\nprovides ample evidence for both answers. Some interpreters, such as\nJ. Hopkins (1996), see his use of medieval scholastic language for the\npowers and activities of the mind as placing him mainly in the\nmedieval Aristotelian-Thomist tradition of critical realism, while\nemphasizing anew the active character of knowing at all levels and\nthus stressing that the mind is an active power. Those interpreters\nwhose proclivities are more Kantian, for instance, K. Flasch (1998)\nand K. Kremer (1978, 2000), find in his texts gestures towards what\nwould in Kant become \u201cthe transcendental unity of\napperception\u201d and \u201ca priori\u201d concepts of the\nunderstanding, not to mention the stress on active judgment. The view\nof the present author is that both of these interpretations may miss\nthe Neoplatonic context in which Nicholas discusses human knowledge\nand may underestimate how important philosophical theology is to the\nCusan exposition of knowing.\n\nWhat are the clues we need to connect the metaphors of likening and\nmeasuring in a complementary way? We must return to Nicholas\u2019\nunderlying conviction that our minds are images of God\u2019s mind\nand that this connection between them is constant and thoroughgoing\nand thus should never be overlooked. Then we may begin to understand\nthat just as God\u2019s creative measuring sets the ontological\nlimits of everything God creates, so our corresponding measuring can\nat best be assimilative of the mind-independent things we wish to know\nbut do not create or place in reality, and yet be creative in\nmeasuring and adjudicating the conceptual domain that results from our\nknowing them.\n\nBoth of these strands can seen to be operative in chapter 7 of The\nLayman: About Mind. There Cusanus gives a somewhat more detailed\naccount of how he sees the mind\u2019s cognitive functions operating\nat the levels of sensation, imagination, reasoning and intellectual\nvision or intuition. Here, as in his later work entitled\nCompendium, we find that Nicholas inherited a technical\nvocabulary and conceptual framework for human knowing that embodies\nthe medieval Aristotelian view that natural things are the causes and\nmeasures of perceptual and conceptual human knowledge. On that view,\nwhat we understand is to correspond to the intelligible aspects of\nthings that are mind-independent so that an identity in\nintelligibility between mind and thing results\u2014the mind is\nmeasured by things. While Nicholas insists that the active,\nself-moving mind directs and integrates the joint operation of our\nknowing capacities, he also agrees that the mind has no innate ideas\nand that mental life has to be awakened or stimulated by direct\ncontact with the perceptible world. He never questions that the\nperceptible world (\u201cthe plurality of things\u201d) exists and\nis independent of our minds and our knowledge.\n\nIt is the mind\u2019s power to discriminate and make sense of what we\nperceive, imagine or remember that Cusanus emphasizes. He writes,\nspeaking of imagination, \u201cWhen sensible things are not present,\nit [imagination] conforms itself to things in a confused way and\nwithout discriminating one condition from another. But [when]\nfunctioning with thinking imagination conforms itself to things while\ndiscriminating one condition from another.\u201d (Idiota de\nmente, c.7)\n\nTo help us understand the mind\u2019s engagement in perceptual\n\u201cassimilation,\u201d Nicholas turns to the work of sculptors\nand craftsmen who use wax or clay to make an impression of some shape\nso they can work from that likeness. When it is a matter of planning\nsomething to do or make, it is easy to see our minds as active. What\nabout perceptual experiences where what we encounter is not up to us?\nNicholas returns to the wax, asking us to imagine wax informed by mind\nin the way mind informs our capacities for sensing and proposing that\nmind so imagined could \u201cform the wax to every shape presented to\nit.\u201d (c.7) Nicholas is saying, in effect, that\n\u201cassimilation\u201d in perception is indeed a matter of\nreason\u2019s active selecting and managing the deliverances of sense\nand imagination that result from our encounters with perceptible\nthings. We are not mere passive recipients of colors, sounds, textures\nand so on, but our minds differentiate and connect perceptions and\nimages in order to form concepts based on the discriminations of\nreason.\n\nNicholas avers that our knowledge of the natural and cultural world\nembodied in and made systematic in the technical and mechanical and\nliberal arts will remain \u201cconjectural.\u201d The reason is that\nwe are not dealing with the true reality of mind-independent things\nwhose true forms are one with God. We only encounter the physically\nlocated temporal realities that are images of the really real. As he\nremarks, \u201cthe notions that are attained through the\nassimilations of reason are uncertain, because they are in accord with\nthe images of forms rather than with their true [forms].\u201d\n(ibid., c.7) Only the concepts of mathematics are not\nconjectural because we fashion or construct these ideas ourselves.\nConsequently our conceptions of them can be precise and certain, for\nas conceptual entities they escape the sorts of change and bodily\nlimits characteristic of the physical world.\n2.2.3 The Measure of Knowledge\n\nBut this sketch of our knowing powers as assimilative does not settle\nwhat is normative for human knowing or what it means to take the mind\nas a measure. Nicholas takes up this explicitly a bit later in chapter\n9 of The Layman: About Mind. When he is questioned how the\nmind can be a measure adequate to such a variety of things, the layman\nresponds somewhat cryptically:\n\nIn the way an \u201cabsolute\u201d face would make itself the\nmeasure of all faces. For when you attend to the fact that mind is a\ncertain absolute measure that cannot be greater or smaller since it is\nnot restricted to quantity, and when you attend to the fact that this\nmeasure is alive so that it measures by itself (as if a living compass\nwere to measure by itself), then you grasp how it makes itself into a\nconcept, measure, or exemplar so that it attains itself in everything.\n(c.9)\n\n\nEarlier the layman had described the human mind as a measure that sets\nlimits, conceptual and linguistic boundaries, to all that it knows.\nWhat this presupposes are the requirements of any measuring,\nquantitative or qualitative: (1) something measurable to be\nascertained, (2) a measure, that is a criterion or norm embodying\nstandard units, (3) the actual measuring that employs the norm, (4)\nthe results of the process, the measure taken.\n\nAll these requirements can be found in the passage above. What we want\nto know counts as the cognitively measurable (\u201csuch a variety of\nthings\u201d). These knowables span items in the natural world and\nthe cultural sphere and their features, as well as concepts in the\nrealm of thought itself. The \u201cconcept, measure, or\nexemplar\u201d is the qualitative norm the mind employs and of which\nit is the source. The mind does the actual measuring (\u201cmeasures\nby itself\u201d) and \u201cmakes itself a measure\u201d or norm in\njudging and taking the measure of each item across the range of things\nit knows. What results is the knowledge we obtain when the mind\nbecomes \u201cequal to such a variety of things\u201d and\n\u201cattains itself in everything.\u201d Our knowledge includes\nwhat we gain from everyday experience in society, from the natural and\nhuman sciences, and from literature and the other arts.\n\nWhat does the reference to \u201cabsolute face\u201d in the passage\nquoted come to? \u201cAbsolute\u201d is a term Cusanus usually\nreserved for God as the infinite One free from every limitation and\nrestriction. Here it is transferred to our minds as images of God. Our\nminds are not limited to quantitative measures and thus can determine\nthe conceptual measures or \u201cunits\u201d that best fit or are\nadequate to the different sorts of things we want to know. We can\nanswer questions of \u201cwhat sort,\u201d not just of \u201chow\nmuch.\u201d Our concepts and judgments are assimilative or actively\nlikened to what we know because we construct the conceptual measures\nappropriate, if never wholly adequate, to what we are investigating or\nthinking about. As thus relatively unrestricted or\n\u201cabsolute,\u201d our minds can be conformed to whatever is\nknowable in whatever way we can grasp it. Just as the absolute divine\n\u201cface\u201d or mind is the infinite measure of all the\ncreaturely minds that are its images, so the human mind measures the\ndeterminate conceptual realities that reflect its own finite unity or\noneness.\n\nHuman concepts are measures insofar they involve choice and\nconstruction, application and interpretation, whether quantitative or\nqualitative. The use of a given group of concepts or a particular\nscheme of ideas or interpretative framework is a matter of human\ncreating. If we recognize some mind-independent phenomena we want to\nexplore and come to know, whether in nature or in culture, we should\nalso recognize that it is up to us to construct and employ the\nappropriate cognitive measures in order to \u201ctake the\nmeasure\u201d of the state of affairs in question. Being introduced\nto some cognitive domain or area of practice we are unfamiliar with\ninvolves learning \u201ca new vocabulary\u201d and set of ideas\nalready utilized and standard in that area. Unless and until we can\nunderstand the concepts and language in question, we cannot make sense\nout of what we perceive and continue to understand in our previous\nterms.\n\nThat Nicholas is using \u201cmeasuring\u201d in this sense is\nbrought home to us by the metaphor he employs in the passage quoted\nabove from chapter 9 where he says the mind is \u201ca living compass\nthat measures by itself.\u201d In contrast with a fixed or\nnon-adjustable straight ruler, a compass or caliper can be adjusted to\nfit a range of sizes and shapes. Cusanus\u2019 fanciful\n\u201cliving\u201d compass reminds us that as knowers we can\nactively accommodate our ideas to what we want to know. As a compass\ncan be adjusted to find the quantitative measure of a variety of sizes\nand shapes, so our minds are able to fashion, adopt, modify and\nutilize both the literal and the symbolic ideas and concepts available\nto us for exploring and understanding the natural, social and\nconceptual worlds we inherit and extend.\n\nThis may help us understand why Nicholas\u2019 sketch of\nmens involves both the mind-independent things and the mind\nitself as normative measures of the assimilation that is human\ncognition. We become like the knowable features of the things we know\nand we fashion the conceptual and judgmental measures whereby we take\nthem into ourselves as known. The full determinate intelligibility of\nmind-independent things and states of affairs provides a kind of ideal\nlimit that we acknowledge in recognizing the inadequacy and\nshortcomings of what we do know about them. That is why Nicholas deems\nour knowledge \u201cconjectural.\u201d\n\nAlong with providing this ideal limit to what we know, things outside\nthe mind also stand as referents that themselves measure our cognitive\nassimilating. Recognizing that they exist, we also acknowledge that\nthey are what our knowledge is about. And we constantly return to what\nwe seek to understand to assess the adequacy of our conceptions and to\ncorrect any mistakes or misinterpretations in our interpretations.\nDeprived of these independent measures, our knowledge has no reference\noutside the mind and no standard for revising or improving our\nconceptual measures as more or less adequate to what we are trying to\nunderstand.\n\nThe Cusan answer, then, to the question of whether mind or the\nmind-independent realities are the \u201cmeasures\u201d of what we\nknow may thus be seen as an attempt to have it both ways. We are both\nmeasured by the things we know and we construct the concepts and\nconceptual frameworks whereby we measure them, however\n\u201cconjecturally.\u201d There are situations and realities we\nwant to understand that challenge us to adjust to what we perceive,\nexamine, and experience. So, too, there are situations and realities\nthat require us to modify our ideas and concepts and symbols so that\nthey will be consistent one with another and with the rest of our\nbeliefs.\n\nNicholas of Cusa thus combines the metaphors of assimilatio\nand mensuratio in his account of what provides the cognitive\nnorms or criteria for human knowing. We cannot resolve the tension\nbetween the two that we find in what he says, but must hold onto it.\nThe reason is that, as God\u2019s images, we do not create but must\nrecognize what God has created as independent of human knowledge. We\nmay fashion the interpretative measures whereby we know created\nthings, but we do this while acknowledging that the full\nintelligibility of each determinate reality is ultimately identical\nwith God\u2019s unknowable Oneness. We may aspire to full\nintelligibility but can reach it only in mathematics. That is why our\nbest knowledge, even of the mind itself, remains conjectural, sharing\nGod\u2019s truth but limited to human ways of knowing.\n",
