    "main_text": "Sir William Hamilton (1788\u20131856)\n3. Sir William Hamilton (1788\u20131856)\n\nSir William Hamilton was a graduate of the Universities of Glasgow and\nOxford. At Glasgow he studied logic and moral philosophy under George\nJardine and James Mylne. Though neither published anything of\nsignificance, they both transmitted to a new generation the\nphilosophical legacy of Reid \u2013 though not uncritically. Mylne in\nparticular seems to have viewed Reid with detachment. In 1807 at\nBalliol College Oxford Hamilton held the Snell Exhibition, a\nscholarship that regularly allowed Scottish students of philosophy to\nspend time at England's oldest university, and though he found the\nintellectual life there uninspiring compared to Edinburgh, he gained\nan extensive knowledge of Aristotelianism . From 1811\u201321 he\nworked at the Scottish Bar (with limited success) until being\nappointed Professor of Universal and Civil History at the University\nof Edinburgh, where he transferred to the Chair of Logic and\nMetaphysics in 1836, a post he held until his death in 1856.\n\nAt the height of his powers, Hamilton was regarded as a major\nintellectual figure of international importance. In a memoir, Noah\nPorter, President of Yale, records that in America Hamilton \u201cwas\nregarded as the greatest writer and teacher among living Englishmen\n[sic!]\u201d. Further evidence of this towering stature lies in the\nfact that a volume on Hamilton was included in the series\nPhilosophical Classics, edited by William Knight, Professor\nof Moral Philosophy at St Andrews. The inclusion ranked him alongside\nDescartes, Berkeley, Locke, Kant and Hegel. Such an estimation must\nnow strike us as strange, yet there is point in asking why his times\nregarded him in such a favorable light. The answer has several\nsources. First there was his personal charisma and enormous\nerudition\u2014\u2018possibly the most learned Scot that ever\nlived\u2019 according to Alexander Campbell Fraser, his successor in\nthe Chair at Edinburgh. Secondly, (as Porter records) by the early\n19th century, a measure of intellectual exhaustion had set in in\nphilosophical circles, and this provided a ready audience for his\nvigorous style of writing. Thirdly, there was his almost unique\nknowledge of German philosophy. Thanks to two trips he made to Germany\nduring his years as a lawyer, Hamilton acquired an extensive knowledge\nof Kant and his immediate successors, little of which had been\ntranslated into English but which Hamilton was able to read in the\noriginal language. At the same time, he was not only thoroughly versed\nin the Scottish tradition of philosophy that he had acquired from\nJardine and Mylne, but an enthusiastic exponent of Reid, whose\ncollected works he edited and annotated extensively. He was thus\nperfectly placed to broaden the horizons of Scottish philosophy, to\npush it beyond the narrower confines of Common Sense by bringing to\nwider attention the importance of Kant, while doing so as one\nprofoundly sympathetic to the native tradition. It is precisely for\nthese reasons, in fact, that he is praised by John Veitch in the\nPhilosophical Classics volume devoted to his philosophy.\n\nHamilton's published relatively little during his lifetime, and though\ntwo volumes of lectures appeared after his death, his philosophical\nviews can be adequately ascertained from three long essays that he\nwrote for the Edinburgh Review\u2014\u201cThe Philosophy of\nthe Unconditioned\u201d (1829), \u201cThe Philosophy of\nPerception\u201d (1830) and \u201cLogic\u201d (1833), subsequently\nrepublished in a collection of his papers. In the first of these\nHamilton recounts the course philosophy had taken in France after\n\u201cthe philosophy of Descartes and Malebranche had sunk into\noblivion\u201d (Hamilton 1853, 2). It began with the emergence of a\nhighly materialist version of Lockean empiricism \u201ca doctrine so\nmelancholy in its consequences, and founded on principles thus partial\nand exaggerated, [that it] could not be permanent\u201d (ibid., 3).\nRescue came from two sources. The first of these was the Scottish\nPhilosophy of Common Sense which showed that there are mental\nphenomena that cannot be interpreted as any form of sensation and that\n\u201cintelligence supposes principles, which, as conditions\nof its activity, cannot be the results of its\noperation\u201d (ibid., 3 emphasis original). The other source of\nrenewal was German philosophy after Kant, and in particular the\nAbsolute Idealism that was \u201cfounded by Fichte, but evolved by\nSchelling\u201d (ibid., 6). \u201cThe Philosophy of the\nUnconditioned\u201d is ostensibly a review of Victor Cousin's Course\nde Philosophie, which had been published in Paris the previously year\n(1828), but the \u2018review\u2019 is chiefly important in its\nproviding an occasion for Hamilton to formulate his own solution to\nthe tension between the philosophy of common sense and the way of\nideas.\n\nThe question at issue can be expressed in a number of different ways.\nKant held that we can only have knowledge of phenomena, never of\nnoumena or things in themselves. Clearly this version of\nphenomenalism, though in many ways the antithesis of empiricism, has\nelements in common with the \u201cway of ideas\u201d to which Reid\nobjected, which holds that the mind apprehends the world indirectly,\nthrough \u201cimpressions\u201d. The alternative position, referred\nto in the 19th century as \u201cpresentationism\u201d is\noften called \u201cdirect realism\u201d and holds, as Reid contends,\nthat we directly apprehend the world of real things. Both positions\nhave their difficulties. Those who followed Kant, notably Fichte and\nSchelling, sought to escape the \u201cscandal\u201d of unknowable\nthings-in-themselves, and those who followed Reid sought to overcome\nthe contention implicit in his approach that our knowledge of the\nworld is \u201cconditioned\u201d by the principle of common sense.\nHence the pursuit of a philosophy of the\n\u201cunconditioned\u201d.\n\nHamilton argues that the age-old search for a philosophy of the\nunconditioned is futile, and he contends that what is in effect a\ncombination of phenomenalism and presentationism will supply\neverything that a properly grounded understanding of reality requires.\nIn \u201cThe Philosophy of Perception\u201d he engages in the debate\nby defending Reid against criticisms in Thomas Brown's posthumously\npublished Lectures, and in a very vigorous\nmanner\u2014\u201cIt is always unlucky to stumble on the threshold.\nThe paragraph (Lect. xxvii) in which Dr Brown opens his attack on Reid\ncontains more mistakes than sentences\u201d (ibid. 69). Brown claimed\nthat a close analysis of Reid's writings showed that his position on\nperception was not really that of direct realism but\n\u201chypothetical realism\u201d, that is the belief in an external\nworld that cannot be known directly. It is this contention that\nHamilton aims to refute, but it is arguable that he misinterprets\nBrown. Moreover in his notes to Reid's Collected Works, which\nwere composed rather later, he appears to come round to something very\nlike Brown's interpretation and to hold that Reid was not, strictly\nspeaking, a direct realist after all.\n\nIf we construe Reid as holding that in the act of perception there are\nthree elements\u2014the physiological modification of the organ, a\nmental sensation and the perception of an object\u2014then we can\ncontrast this with Hamilton's position which holds that the mental\nsensation and the perception are simultaneous and in a sense two sides\nof the same coin. Reid holds, of course, that we do not reason from\nsensation to perception; the apprehending mind moves from one to the\nother by a natural, inbuilt instinct\u2014one of the principles of\ncommon sense. Hamilton too holds that there is no reasoning process\nhere, but he also thinks that the continuing division that Reid is\nemploying between sensation and perception is incompatible with the\nidea of immediate perception or direct realism. Hence his amendment,\nwhich so to speak ties the sensation and perception together. But how\nis this further contention to be sustained? Is it a conceptual truth\nof some kind, or an empirical observation about how the mind works?\nHamilton's writings in general tend to assertion more than argument,\nand while he has a great deal to say on this point, it does seem that\nhis \u201csolution\u201d to the problem of perception is an\narbitrary stipulation designed to overcome it. At any rate, if we do\npress the question of its defence, we quickly encounter a new version\nof the old division, namely whether the perception is to be identified\nas a manifestation of self-evident principles of common sense, or as a\npsychological association of ideas. In this sense Hamilton's thesis is\nstill set within the fundamental parameters of the Hume/Reid debate.\n\n\nAt the time of his death, Hamilton's philosophical endeavors were\nwidely regarded as offering the most profound treatment to date of\nsome of philosophy's deepest and most perennial problems. This\nestimation did not persist for long. Two devastating attacks, from\nstrikingly different philosophical perspectives, appeared in print\nwithin a decade. The best known of these was John Stuart Mill's\nExamination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy (1865).\nMill's two volume work constituted a detailed and highly critical\nexamination of Hamilton's philosophical contentions (as well as his\nexcursions into logic) largely from the point of view of empiricism in\ngeneral, and empirical psychology in particular. In the same year, the\nScottish philosopher Hutchison Stirling, in Sir William Hamilton:\nBeing the Philosophy of Perception an Analysis published the\nfirst (and ultimately only) part of an equally strenuous attack from\nan Idealist point of view. Hamilton's defenders leapt into print,\nnotably the Oxford philosopher H L Mansel (whom Mill had also\nattacked) and John Veitch, Hamilton's student and amanuensis. James\nMcCosh, then Professor of Logic at Belfast, also joined the fray with\nAn Examination of Mr J S Mill's Philosophy (1866), though\nthis was much more an attack on Mill than a defence of Hamilton.\n\nDespite these vigorous voices, Hamilton's philosophical reputation\ndeclined rapidly. In terms of the tradition of Scottish philosophy,\nhowever, it was not Mill who mattered most, but Hamilton's student and\nfriend James Frederick Ferrier. It was Ferrier who strove most\nobviously, in the name of Scottish philosophy, to take a different\ntack from both Reid and Hamilton.\n",
