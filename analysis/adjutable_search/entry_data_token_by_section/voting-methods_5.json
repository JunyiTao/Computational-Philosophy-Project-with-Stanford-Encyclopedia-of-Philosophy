    "main_text": "Examples of Voting Methods || Quadratic Voting and Liquid Democracy\n2.3 Quadratic Voting and Liquid Democracy\n\nIn this section, I briefly discuss two new approaches to voting that\ndo not fit nicely into the categories of voting methods introduced in\nthe previous sections. While both of these methods can be used to\nselect representatives, such as a president, the primary application\nis a group of people voting directly on propositions, or referendums.\n\n\nQuadratic Voting: When more than 50% of the voters support an\nalternative, most voting methods will select that alternative. Indeed,\nwhen there are only two alternatives, such as when voting for or\nagainst a proposition, there are many arguments that identify majority\nrule as the best and most stable group decision method (May 1952;\nMaskin 1995). One well-known problem with always selecting the\nmajority winner is the so-called tyranny of the majority. A\ncomplete discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this article.\nThe main problem from the point of view of the analysis of voting\nmethods is that there may be situations in which a majority of the\nvoters weakly support a proposition while there is a sizable minority\nof voters that have a strong preference against the proposition. \n\nOne way of dealing with this problem is to increase the quota required\nto accept a proposition. However, this gives too much power to a small\ngroup of voters. For instance, with Unanimity Rule a single voter can\nblock a proposal from being accepted. Arguably, a better solution is\nto use ballots that allow voters to express something about their\nintensity of preference for the alternatives. Setting aside issues\nabout interpersonal comparisons of utility (see, for instance, Hausman\n1995), this is the benefit of using the voting methods discussed in\nSection 2.2, such as Score Voting or Majority Judgement. These voting\nmethods assume that there is a fixed set of grades that the\nvoters use to express their intensity of preference. One challenge is\nfinding an appropriate set of grades for a population of voters. Too\nfew grades makes it harder for a sizable minority with strong\npreferences to override the majority opinion, but too many grades\nmakes it easy for a vocal minority to overrule the majority opinion.\n\n\nUsing ideas from mechanism design (Groves and Ledyard 1977; Hylland and\nZeckhauser 1980), the economist E. Glen Weyl developed a voting method\ncalled Quadratic Voting that mitigates some of the above issues\n(Lalley and Weyl 2018a). The idea is to think of an election as a\nmarket (Posner and Weyl, 2018, Chapter 2). Each voter can purchase\nvotes at a costs that is quadratic in the number of votes. For\ninstance, a voter must pay $25 for 5 votes (either in favor or against\na proposition). After the election, the money collected is distributed\non a pro rata basis to the voters. There are a variety of\neconomic arguments that justify why voters should pay \\(v^2\\) to\npurchase \\(v\\) votes (Lalley and Weyl 2018b; Goeree and Zhang 2017).\nSee Posner and Weyl 2015 and 2017 for further discussion and a\nvigorous defense of the use of Quadratic Voting in national elections. \nConsult Laurence and Sher 2017 for  two arguments against the use of Quadratic Voting.   \nBoth arguments are derived from the presence of wealth inequality.   The first \nargument is that it is ambiguous whether the Quadratic Voting decision really  outperforms a decision using majority rule from the perspective of utilitarianism \n(see Driver 2014 and Sinnott-Armstrong 2019 for overviews of utilitarianism).  \nThe second argument is that any vote-buying mechanism will have a hard \ntime meeting a legitimacy requirement, familiar from the theory of democratic \ninstitutions (cf. Fabienne 2017). \n\n\n\n\nLiquid Democracy: Using Quadratic Voting, the voters\u2019 opinions\nmay end up being weighted differently: Voters that purchase more of a\nvoice have more influence over the election. There are other reasons\nwhy some voters\u2019 opinions may have more weight than others when making\na decision about some issue. For instance, a voter may have been\nelected to represent a constituency, or a voter may be recognized as\nan expert on the issue under consideration. An alternative approach to\ngroup decision making is direct democracy in which every\ncitizen is asked to vote on every political issue. Asking the citizens\nto vote on every issue faces a number of challenges, \n nicely explained by Green-Armytage (2015, pg. 191):\n\nDirect democracy without any option for representation is problematic.\nEven if it were possible for every citizen to learn everything they\ncould possibly know about every political issue, people who did this\nwould be able to do little else, and massive amounts of time would be\nwasted in duplicated effort. Or, if every citizen voted but most\npeople did not take the time to learn about the issues, the results\nwould be highly random and/or highly sensitive to overly simplistic\npublic relations campaigns. Or, if only a few citizens voted,\nparticular demographic and ideological groups would likely be\nunder-represented\n\n\nOne way  to deal with some of the problems raised in the above quote is to \nuse proxy voting, in which voters can delegate their vote \non some issues (Miller 1969). Liquid Democracy is a form of proxy voting \nin which voters can delegate their votes to other voters (ideally, to voters that are\nwell-informed about the issue under consideration). What distinguishes\nLiquid Democracy from proxy voting is that proxies may further\ndelegate the votes entrusted to them. For example, suppose that there\nis a vote to accept or reject a proposition. Each voter is given the\noption to delegate their vote to another voter, called a proxy. The\nproxies, in turn, are given the option to delegate their votes to yet\nanother voter. The voters that decide to not transfer their votes cast\na vote weighted by the number of voters who entrusted them as a proxy,\neither directly or indirectly. \n\nWhile there has been some discussion of proxy voting in the political\nscience literature (Miller 1969; Alger 2006; Green-Armytage 2015),\nmost studies of Liquid Democracy can be found in the computer science\nliterature. A notable exception is Blum and Zuber 2016 that justifies\nLiquid Democracy, understood as a procedure for democratic\ndecision-making, within normative democratic theory. An overview of\nthe origins of Liquid Democracy and pointers to other online\ndiscussions can be found in Behrens 2017. Formal studies of Liquid\nDemocracy have focused on: the possibility of delegation cycles and\nthe relationship with the theory of judgement aggregation (Christoff\nand Grossi 2017); the rationality of delegating votes (Bloembergen,\nGrossi and Lackner 2018); the potential problems that arise when many\nvoters delegate votes to only a few voters (Kang et al. 2018; Golz et\nal. 2018); and generalizations of Liquid Democracy beyond binary\nchoices (Brill and Talmon 2018; Zhang and Zhou 2017). \n",
