    "main_text": "Life and Political Activity || Turin (1911\u20131922)\n1.2 Turin (1911\u20131922)\n\nTurin contrasted radically with Gramsci\u2019s southern upbringing:\nit was an advanced industrial city, dominated by the FIAT car\nfactories and connected to wider European cultures. For some years,\nGramsci endured the precarious existence of an impoverished student;\nhis education was frequently interrupted by poverty, nervous\nexhaustion, and ill-health. At university he studied philology, or\nlinguistics, and worked under the guidance of the socio-linguist\nProfessor Matteo Bartoli, who was drawn to Gramsci\u2019s native\nfamiliarity with Sardinian dialect (see Ives 2004). Bartoli envisaged\nGramsci becoming a linguist. Studying in the Humanities,\nGramsci\u2019s own ambitions were, originally, to train as a teacher.\nAt university, he contributed to reviews with articles on Futurism\n(SCW: 46\u201349).\n\nGramsci did not formally complete his university studies. He abandoned\neducation in 1915 and became a full-time journalist and socialist\nactivist. Joining the Italian Socialist Party (Partito socialista\nitaliano, or PSI) in 1913, he became involved in worker\u2019s\neducation. Two years later, he was offered a position as a journalist\nfor the Turin edition of the PSI daily newspaper, Avanti!\nAlready a contributor to the weekly Il Grido del Popolo\n(\u201cThe People\u2019s Cry\u201d), he accepted the offer and\nbegan writing political commentaries and theatre reviews under a\nregular column, titled \u201cSotto la Mole\u201d (\u201cIn the\nshadow of the Mole Antoniella\u201d, a landmark in Turin, designed\noriginally as a synagogue, near to where Gramsci lodged). In 1917, he\nco-published a single issue socialist cultural review, aimed at young\nsocialists, entitled La Citt\u00e0 futura (\u201cCity of\nthe Future\u201d).\n\nThe prospect of world war deeply split the Italian public and\npolitical parties into \u201cinterventionists\u201d and\n\u201cneutralists\u201d. The firebrand revolutionary socialist,\nBenito Mussolini, came out for intervention against the PSI\u2019s\nofficial neutrality. Entering the war, he hoped, would initiate a\nwider collapse of the liberal order and ignite social revolution.\nMussolini was eventually forced out of the party. The young Gramsci\nwas also tempted by that stance and declared his preference not for\nintervention but for an \u201cactive neutrality\u201d that took the\nwar as a moment to prepare for radical transformation (SPWI:\n6\u20139). For this milder resistance to the party\u2019s formal\nposition, he was thereafter treated with some suspicion by fellow\nsocialists.\n\nInspired by the Russian Revolutions of February and October 1917,\nGramsci aligned himself with the \u201cintransigent\nrevolutionary\u201d faction in the PSI, urging it to pursue its\n\u201cmaximalist\u201d program of radical transformation. He became\nsecretary of the executive committee of the Turin socialists and, in\nthe same year, took up the role of editor of Il Grido del\nPopolo. In December 1917 he published \u201cThe Revolution\nAgainst Capital\u201d in Avanti!, and used Il\nGrido to publicize news and commentary on events in Russia,\nincluding texts by Lenin and Trotsky (SPWI: 34\u20137). He made\nvarious efforts to organize a local proletarian cultural association\nto galvanize political and economic struggles into a general\nrevolutionary project, although they did not take off.\n\nAfter the war Gramsci joined with university and socialist friends to\nfound and edit a new review, L\u2019Ordine Nuovo (\u201cThe\nNew Order\u201d). Intended, initially, as a journal of\n\u201csocialist culture\u201d it became a medium to discuss the\nindustrial factory struggles then underway in Turin. In Ordine\nNuovo, Gramsci presented a theory of a workers\u2019 state\ninspired by the efforts at self-management by skilled workers (see\nSPWI: 65\u2013124). Spurred on by the workers\u2019 disputes and\nfactory occupations across the years 1919 and 1920, he published\nwritings by syndicalist thinkers, participated in debates, and set out\nhis own views on the potential for the factories to become the locus\nof proletarian state institutions (see Clark 1977).\n\nAfter the occupations ended in defeat, Gramsci aligned with the\ncommunist faction of the PSI, calling for the party to be renewed as a\nrevolutionary organization. In January 1921 in Livorno, the communists\nformally split from the PSI and established the Communist Party of\nItaly (Partito comunista d\u2019Italia or PCd\u2019I). Led\nby the militant, Amadeo Bordiga, the new party required rigid\ndiscipline and had firm ideological roots in Marxist doctrine. Gramsci\nwas elected to its central committee and Ordine Nuovo was\ntransformed into the party\u2019s daily paper.\n\nThe PCd\u2019I remained too small to have any serious impact on\nevents. Despite substantial success in the 1919 elections, the now\ndivided left were increasingly outwitted by the maneuverings of\nMussolini, and his \u201cfascist\u201d movement. Throughout 1921 and\n1922, fascist \u201csquads\u201d terrorized trade unions across the\nnorth of Italy, burning down their offices and sending armed gangs to\nviolently assault workers and peasants. In October 1922, Mussolini was\ninvited by the King to lead a coalition government, supported by\nconservative politicians increasingly alarmed at the intensity of\nsocial disorder and the prospect of a workers\u2019 revolution.\n",
