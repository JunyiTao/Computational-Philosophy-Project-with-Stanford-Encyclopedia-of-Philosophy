    "main_text": "A Brief History of the Field || Milestones\n1.3 Milestones\n\nThe idea of a computational device based on quantum mechanics was\nexplored already in the 1970s by physicists and computer scientists.\nAs early as 1969 Steven Wiesner suggested quantum information\nprocessing as a possible way to better accomplish cryptologic tasks.\nBut the first four published papers on quantum information (Wiesner\npublished his only in 1983), belong to Alexander Holevo (1973), R. P.\nPoplavskii (1975), Roman Ingarden (1976), and Yuri Manin (1980).\nBetter known are contributions made in the early 1980s by Charles H.\nBennett of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Paul A. Benioff\nof Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, David Deutsch of the\nUniversity of Oxford, and Richard P. Feynman of the California\nInstitute of Technology. The idea emerged when scientists were\ninvestigating the fundamental physical limits of computation. If\ntechnology continued to abide by \u201cMoore\u2019s Law\u201d (the\nobservation made in 1965 by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, that\nthe number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had\ndoubled every 18 months since the integrated circuit was invented),\nthen the continually shrinking size of circuitry packed onto silicon\nchips would eventually reach a point where individual elements would\nbe no larger than a few atoms. But since the physical laws that govern\nthe behaviour and properties of the putative circuit at the atomic\nscale are inherently quantum mechanical in nature, not classical, the\nnatural question arose whether a new kind of computer could be devised\nbased on the principles of quantum physics.\n\nInspired by Ed Fredkin\u2019s ideas on reversible computation (see\nHagar 2016), Feynman was among the first to attempt to provide an\nanswer to this question by producing an abstract model in 1982 that\nshowed how a quantum system could be used to do computations. He also\nexplained how such a machine would be able to act as a simulator for\nquantum physics, conjecturing that any classical computer could do the\nsame task only inefficiently. In 1985 David Deutsch proposed the first\nuniversal quantum Turing machine and paved the way to the quantum\ncircuit model (Deutsch 1989). The young and thriving domain also\nattracted philosophers\u2019 attention. In 1983 David Albert showed\nhow a quantum mechanical automaton behaves remarkably differently from\na classical automaton, and in 1990 Itamar Pitowsky raised the question\nof whether the superposition principle may allow quantum computers to\nefficiently solve NP-complete problems. He also\nstressed that although one could in principle \u2018squeeze\u2019\ninformation of exponential complexity into polynomially many quantum\nstates, the real problem lay in the efficient retrieval of this\ninformation.\n\nProgress in quantum algorithms began in the 1990s, with the discovery\nof the Deutsch-Josza algorithm (1992) and of Simon\u2019s algorithm\n(1994). The latter supplied the basis for Shor\u2019s algorithm for\nfactoring. Published in 1994, this algorithm marked a\n\u2018phase transition\u2019 in the development of quantum computing\nand sparked a tremendous interest even outside the physics community.\nIn that year the first experimental realisation of the quantum\nCNOT gate with trapped ions was proposed by Cirac and Zoller\n(1995). In 1995, Peter Shor and Andrew Steane proposed (independently)\nthe first scheme for quantum error-correction. In that same year the\nfirst realisation of a quantum logic gate was done in Boulder,\nColorado, following Cirac and Zoller\u2019s proposal. In 1996, Lov\nGrover from Bell Labs invented a quantum search algorithm which yields\na provable (though only quadratic) \u201cspeed-up\u201d compared to\nits classical counterparts. A year later the first model for quantum\ncomputation based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques was\nproposed. This technique was realised in 1998 with a 2-qubit register,\nand was scaled up to 7 qubits in the Los Alamos National Lab in\n2000.\n\nSince 2000 the field has seen tremendous growth. New paradigms of\nquantum algorithms have appeared, such as adiabatic algorithms,\nmeasurement-based algorithms, and\ntopological-quantum-field-theory-based algorithms, as well as new\nphysical models for realising a large scale quantum computer with cold\nion traps, quantum optics (using photons and optical cavity),\ncondensed matter systems and solid state physics (meanwhile, the first\nNMR model had turned out to be a dead-end with respect to scaling; see\nDiVincenzo (2000)). The basic questions, however, remain open even\ntoday: (1) theoretically, can quantum algorithms efficiently solve\nclassically intractable problems? (2) operationally, can we actually\nrealise a large scale quantum computer to run these algorithms?\n",
