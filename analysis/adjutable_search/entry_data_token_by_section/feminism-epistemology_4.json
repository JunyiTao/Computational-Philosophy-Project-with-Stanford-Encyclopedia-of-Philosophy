Interactions of Feminist Standpoint Theory, Postmodernism, and Empiricism\n\nHarding\u2019s (1986) tripartite classification of feminist\nepistemologies cast them as three contrasting frameworks. In the last\nthirty years, feminist epistemologists have blurred the distinctions\namong these views, as Harding both predicted and promoted (1990, 1991,\n1998). Early theorizing in feminist epistemology tended to explore\nglobal questions about gender and knowledge: are dominant conceptions\nor practices of science, objectivity, and knowledge masculine or\nandrocentric? The field has evolved toward local investigations of the\nways gender affects inquiry in specific investigations by particular\ncommunities using distinct methods. This turn to the local has\nfacilitated the convergence of the three types of feminist\nepistemology.\n\nFeminist standpoint theory.\n The postmodernist critique of standpoint theory, in conjunction with\nthe proliferation of subaltern women\u2019s standpoints (black,\nLatina, lesbian, postcolonial, etc.) has led most standpoint theorists\nto abandon the search for a single feminist standpoint. They\nacknowledge plural standpoints of intersecting marginalized groups\n(Harding 1991, 1998; Collins 1990). Inquiry that draws on their\ninsights and starts from their predicaments is more fruitful than\ninquiry that draws only on the insights and starts from the\npredicaments of relatively privileged groups (Harding 1993, 1998). It\nalso offers pragmatic advantages in enabling us to envision and\nrealize more just social relations (Hartsock 1996). Standpoint\ntheorists (Collins 1996; Harding 1996; Hartsock 1996) have shifted\nfrom claims of general epistemic privilege to claims of practical\nadvantage in response to postmodernist critics such as Hekman (1996).\nWylie (2003) argues that consensus has emerged among feminist\nepistemologists on two points: (1) rejection of essentialism (the idea\nthat the social groups defining any standpoint have a necessary and\nfixed nature, or that their members do or ought to think alike) and\n(2) rejection of attempts to grant automatic epistemic privilege to\nany particular standpoint. Instead, the social situation of\n\u201cinsider-outsiders\u201d (members of subordinated groups who\nneed accurate knowledge of the worlds of the privileged to navigate\nthem) sometimes affords a contingent epistemic advantage in\nsolving particular problems. Standpoint theorists\u2019 pluralism\nreflects a productive interaction with feminist postmodernism; their\nshift toward pragmatism and contingent epistemic advantages of the\noppressed reflects convergence with feminist empiricism.\n\nTheorists have devoted effort to specifying the contingent cognitive\nadvantages claimed by a feminist standpoint with sufficient precision\nthat these claims are empirically testable. Solomon (2009) suggests\nthat the achievement of a feminist standpoint involves characteristics\nempirically associated with creative thinking. Ruetsche (2004)\nsuggests that it could involve Aristotelian second-nature capacities\nto recognize certain kinds of evidence\u2014for example, social\ninteractions among primates\u2014relevant for understanding primate\nsocial organization. Other standpoint theorists stress the cognitive\nadvantages of a feminist standpoint for revealing and uncovering\nphenomena in domains of interest to feminists. Rolin (2009) points to\nthe superior capacity of a feminist standpoint to reveal how power\nrelations obscure their operations and effects, and enable inquirers\nto overcome these obstacles to understanding by empowering those\nsubordinated by power relations. Scientists who have investigated the\ncauses of women\u2019s underrepresentation in the sciences from a\nfeminist standpoint have produced more empirically adequate theories,\nusing more normatively adequate conceptions of bias and\ndiscrimination, than nonfeminist researchers (Rolin 2006, Wylie\n2009).\n\nFeminist postmodernism. Haraway (1989) stands out among\nfeminist postmodernists for the tributes she pays to the achievements\nof feminist scientists working within empiricist standards of\nevaluation. Fraser and Nicholson (1990) urge a reformulation of the\nlessons of postmodernism toward pragmatism, fallibilism, and\ncontextualization of knowledge claims\u2014all features compatible\nwith naturalized feminist empiricism.\n\nFeminist empiricism. While early feminist science criticism\nby working scientists may have presupposed a naive version of\nempiricism, feminist empiricists today stress the pervasiveness of\nsituated knowledge, the interplay of facts and values, the absence of\ntranscendent standpoints, and the plurality of theories. These themes\nconverge with postmodernism. After thirty years of development, it is\nalso getting harder to identify points of disagreement between\nfeminist empiricism and feminist standpoint theory. Intemann (2010,\n2016) proposes feminist standpoint empiricism as a synthesis\nof the two theories, arguing that feminist empiricists should accept\nstandpoint theory\u2019s claim that better (i.e., feminist) values\nproduce better theories. Feminist empiricists have already done so, as\nlong as these claims are kept contingent and local (Anderson 2004,\nWylie and Nelson 2007). Some feminist standpoint theorists, however,\nalso claim that exclusion of sexist standpoints, or bad values, can be\nepistemically justified (Intemann 2010, Hicks 2011).\n",
