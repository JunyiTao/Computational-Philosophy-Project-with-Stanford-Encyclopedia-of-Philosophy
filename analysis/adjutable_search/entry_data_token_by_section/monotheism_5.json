    "main_text": "An Argument from Omnipotence\n5. An Argument from Omnipotence\n\n\nAl-Ghazali argues that there can\u2019t be two gods, for \u201cwere\nthere two gods and one of them resolved on a course of action, the\nsecond would be either obliged to aid him and [sic] thereby\ndemonstrating that he was a subordinate being and not an all-powerful\ngod, or would be able to oppose and resist thereby demonstrating that\nhe was the all-powerful and the first weak and deficient, not an\nall-powerful god\u201d (Ghazali, 40). Ghazali\u2019s intuition is sound but\nhis argument can be more carefully formulated as follows:\n\nNecessarily, it is possible for the wills of distinct persons to\nconflict. (The possibility of conflict seems included in the concept of\na fully distinct person.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nNecessarily, if there are two distinct, essentially omnipotent\npersons, their wills can conflict. (From 1. Something has a property\nlike omnipotence essentially if and only if it has that property in\nevery logically possible world in which it exists.)\n\n\nIt is necessarily false that the wills of two omnipotent persons\nconflict.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is necessarily false that the wills of two essentially\nomnipotent persons can conflict. (From 3. If there is a possible world\nin which their wills can conflict, then, necessarily, there is a\npossible world in which both are omnipotent and their wills do\nconflict.)\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is impossible for there to be two distinct, essentially\nomnipotent, persons. (From 2 and 4.)\n\n\n\nIt follows that if, as most theists believe,\n\nIt is necessarily true that omnipotence is an essential attribute\nof God,\n\n\n\nthen\n\nIt is impossible for there to be two gods. (From 5 and 6.)\n\n\n\nPremise 3 is proved in this way:\n\nNecessarily, if the will of an omnipotent person conflicts with\nanother person\u2019s will, the latter\u2019s will is thwarted by the former\u2019s\n(since, if it were not, the omnipotent person would not be\nomnipotent.)\nNecessarily, if a person\u2019s will is thwarted by another\u2019s will, then\nthat person is not omnipotent.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nNecessarily, if there were two omnipotent persons and their wills\nconflicted, then (since each of their wills would be thwarted) neither\nwould be omnipotent. (From 8 and 9.)\nIt is impossible for there to be two omnipotent persons neither of\nwhom are omnipotent.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nIt is impossible for the wills of two omnipotent persons to\nconflict. (From 10 and 11.)\n\n\n\nHence,\n\nIt is necessarily false that the wills of two omnipotent persons\nconflict. (From 12.)\n\n\n\nFour of the argument\u2019s five premises (namely, 6, 8, 9, and 11) are\nfairly noncontroversial. Premise 1 has been doubted, however. Thomas V.\nMorris has suggested that, for persons to be distinct, all that is\nneeded is the possibility that their wills differ. Suppose for\nexample, that it is impossible for x to will A and\nfor y to will not-A (and vice versa) but that it\nis possible for x to will A and for\ny to neither will A nor will not-A (and vice\nversa). Their wills could thus differ although they could not\nconflict.\n\n\nIs this sufficient to ensure distinctness of persons, though? It is\nnot clear that it is. If I somehow cannot will anything that\nis opposed to what some other person wills, my selfhood or identity as\na separate person appears endangered. And if the impossibility is not\nmerely contingent but logical or metaphysical, the threat to my\nindependent identity seems even greater.\n\n\nBut this aside, it is doubtful that the wills of two essentially\nomnipotent beings, at least, could differ in the manner\nMorris suggests. For suppose they can. Then, where x and\ny are both essentially omnipotent, and s is some\ncontingent state of affairs that is within the range of omnipotence,\nx can make y impotent with respect to s (and\nvice versa). For even though it is intrinsically possible for\ny to determine whether or not s will occur,\nx, merely by willing s, makes it impossible for\ny to will not-s. That is, x, as it were,\ntakes power over s out of y\u2019s hands. Whether or not\ns occurs, in other words, is no longer up to y. Yet\nsurely, if y is essentially omnipotent, and s is\nwithin the range of its power (as it must be if y is essentially\nomnipotent), no contingent circumstance of this sort could make it\nimpotent with respect to s. (For a similar argument see\nScotus\u2019s seventh proof of unicity [Scotus, 90\u20131].)\n\n\nPremise 1 thus emerges unscathed. Since the proof is valid and its\nother premises appear unexceptionable, the argument from omnipotence\nseems sound.\n",
