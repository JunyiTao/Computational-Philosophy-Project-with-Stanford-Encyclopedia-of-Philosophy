    "main_text": "Memory and Personal Identity || Reid on Personal Identity\n5.2 Reid on Personal Identity\n\n\nReid's theory of memory informs his theory of personal identity, as\ndoes his three criticisms of Locke's theory of personal\nidentity. First, Reid argues that Locke's account is misleading due to\nconfusion between the concepts of consciousness, memory and personal\nidentity (IHM 1.3, 17; see John Locke, Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding 2.27.24, 345). Reid believes that using\n\u2018consciousness\u2019 to describe awareness of past events is a misnomer\nbecause we are only conscious, in such cases, of our remembrance of\nthose events. Second, Reid offers his \u2018Brave Officer\u2019 thought\nexperiment as a counterexample to Locke's account (EIP 3.6, 276). The\npoint of the thought experiment is to show that Locke's theory does\nnot adequately preserve the transitivity of the personal identity\nrelation. Put in other words, Reid argues that \u2018identity\u2019 in Locke's\ntheory of personal identity cannot refer to numerical identity. Third,\nReid follows Bishop Butler in arguing that Locke's justification of\nhis theory of personal identity is circular (EIP 3.6, 277). Reid's\nopposition to Locke (and to Hume's bundle theory) inform Reid's\ncommonsense account of personal identity.\n\n\nReid affirms that humans have diachronic personal identity, and denies\nHume's so-called \u2018bundle theory\u2019. Reid asserts the relation between\nmemory and personal identity in the second of his first principles\ndealing with these issues: \u201cAnother first principle is our own\npersonal identity and continued existence, as far back as we remember\nanything distinctly. This we know immediately, and not by\nreasoning. It seems, indeed, to be a part of the testimony of\nmemory\u201d (EIP 6.5, 476). (See 1.1\nCommon Sense and First Principles above for discussion of Reid's\nfirst principles.)\n\n\nDespite Reid's certainty on this point, he gives few further details\nabout the nature of personal identity and the self. Personal identity\nimplies the \u201ccontinued existence of that indivisible thing which\nI call myself. Whatever this self may be, it is something which\nthinks, and deliberates, and resolves, and acts, and suffers. I am not\nthought, I am not action, I am not feeling; I am something that\nthinks, and acts, and suffers. ...that self or I, to which they\nbelong, is permanent... Such are the notions that I have of my\npersonal identity\u201d (EIP 3.4, 264). Here Reid echoes Descartes'\noperational definition of the self in Meditation 2. Reid also\nargues that persons are not identical to their bodies (EIP 3.4,\n264). (For more on Reid's theories of memory and personal identity,\nsee Reid on Memory and Personal Identity.)\n\n\nReid refuses to speculate on the substance of the enduring self,\nhowever. Despite the fact that Reid is a substance dualist who\nbelieves that selves are eternal souls, he does not defend that view\nin the work that he published. In manuscript lectures he describes\nsouls as \u201cbeings of a quite different Nature\u201d than\nmaterial bodies and says that the death of the body does not imply the\ndeath of the soul (Animate Creation 617\u2013618). As Reid spells\nout his metaphysics of the self and soul here, his arguments become\ntheological and appeal to God's existence, love and justice. He offers\na moral argument about the necessity of reward and punishment for the\nthesis that the self survives bodily death (Animate Creation\n623). Though survival of the self after bodily death is \u201cof the\nhighest Importance to Mankind yet it must be acknowledged that [all]\nthe Arguments that Philosophy suggests upon this head are not of such\nStrength but that they may leave some doubt even in the Minds of wise\nand thinking Men\u201d (Animate Creation 629).\n",
