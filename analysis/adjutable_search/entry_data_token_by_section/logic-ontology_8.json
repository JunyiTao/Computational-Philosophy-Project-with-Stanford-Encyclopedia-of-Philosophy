(L2) meets (O2)\n\nLogically valid inferences are those that are guaranteed to be valid\nby their form. And above we spelled this out as follows: an inference\nis valid by its form if as long as we fix the meaning of certain\nspecial expressions, the logical constants, we can ignore the meaning\nof the other expressions in the statements involved in the inference,\nand we are always guaranteed that the inference is valid, no matter\nwhat the meaning of the other expressions is, as long as the whole is\nmeaningful. A logical truth can be understood as a statement whose\ntruth is guaranteed as long as the meanings of the logical constants\nare fixed, no matter what the meaning of the other expressions is.\nAlternatively, a logical truth is one that is a logical consequence\nfrom no assumptions, i.e. an empty set of premises.\n\nDo logical truths entail the existence of any entities, or is their\ntruth independent of what exists? There are some well known\nconsiderations that seem to support the view that logic should be\nneutral with respect to what there is. On the other hand, there are\nalso some well known arguments to the contrary. In this section we\nwill survey some of this debate.\n\nIf logical truth are ones whose truth is guaranteed as long as the\nmeaning of the logical constants is kept fixed then logical truths are\ngood candidates for being analytic truths. Can analytic truths imply\nthe existence of any entities? This is an old debate, often conducted\nusing \u201cconceptual truths\u201d instead of \u201canalytic\ntruths\u201d. The most prominent debate of this kind is the debate\nabout the ontological argument for the existence of God. Many\nphilosophers have maintained that there can be no conceptual\ncontradiction in denying the existence of particular entities, and\nthus there can be no proof of their existence with conceptual truths\nalone. In particular, an ontological argument for the existence of God\nis impossible. A famous discussion to this effect is Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of the ontological argument (Kant 1781/7, KrV\nA592/B620 ff). On the other hand, many other philosophers have\nmaintained that such an ontological argument is possible, and they\nhave made a variety of different proposals how it can go. We will not\ndiscuss the ontological argument here, however, it is discussed in\ndetail in different formulations in the entry on\n ontological arguments\n in this encyclopedia.\n\nWhatever one says about the possibility of proving the existence of an\nobject purely with conceptual truths, many philosophers have\nmaintained that at least logic has to be neutral about what\nthere is. One of the reasons for this insistence is the idea that\nlogic is topic neutral, or purely general. The logical truths are the\nones that hold no matter what the representations are about, and thus\nthey hold in any domain. In particular, they hold in an empty domain,\none where there is nothing at all. And if that is true then logical\ntruths can\u2019t imply that anything exists. But that argument might\nbe turned around by a believer in logical objects, objects whose\nexistence is implied by logic alone. If it is granted that logical\ntruths have to hold in any domain, then any domain has to contain the\nlogical objects. Thus for a believer in logical objects there can be\nno empty domain.\n\nThere is a close relationship between this debate and a common\ncriticism that standard formal logics (in the sense of (L1))\nwon\u2019t be able to capture the logical truths (in the sense of\n(L3)). It is the debate about the status of the empty domain in the\nsemantics of first and second order logical systems.\n\nIt is a logical truth in (standard) first order logic that something\nexists, i.e., \u2018\\(\\exists x\\,x=x\\)\u2019. Similarly, it is a\nlogical truth in (standard versions of) second order logic that\n\u2018\\(\\exists F\\forall x\\,(Fx \\vee \\neg Fx)\\)\u2019. These are\nexistentially quantified statements. Thus, one might argue, logic is\nnot neutral with respect to what there is. There are logical truths\nthat state that something exists. However, it would be premature to\nconclude that logic is not neutral about what there is, simply because\nthere are logical truths in (standard) first or second order logic\nwhich are existential statements. If we look more closely how it comes\nabout that these existential statements are logical truths in these\nlogical systems we see that it is only so because, by definition, a\nmodel for (standard) first order logic has to have a non-empty domain.\nIt is possible to allow for models with an empty domain as well (where\nnothing exists), but models with an empty domain are excluded, again,\nby definition from the (standard) semantics in first order logic. Thus\n(standard) first order logic is sometimes called the logic of first\norder models with a non-empty domain. If we allow an empty domain as\nwell we will need different axioms or rules of inference to have a\nsound proof system, but this can be done. Thus even though there are\nformal logical systems, in the sense of (L1) in which there are\nlogical truths that are existential statements, this does not answer\nthe question whether or not there are logical truths, in the sense of\n(L2), that are existential statements. The question rather is which\nformal system, in the sense of (L1), best captures the logical truths,\nin the sense of (L2). So, even if we agree that a first order logical\nsystem is a good formal system to represent logical inferences, should\nwe adopt the axioms and rules for models with or without an empty\ndomain?\n\nA related debate is the debate about free logic. Free logics are\nformal systems that drop the assumption made in standard first and\nhigher order logic that every closed term denotes an object in the\ndomain of the model. Free logic allows for terms that denote nothing,\nand in free logic certain rules about the inferential interaction\nbetween quantifiers and terms have to be modified. Whether free or\nun-free (standard) logic is the better formal model for natural\nlanguage logical inference is a further question. For more discussion\nof logic with an empty domain see Quine 1954 and Williamson 1999.\nFor a sound and complete proof system for logic with an empty domain,\nsee Tennant 1990. For a survey article on free logic, see Lambert\n2001.\n\nHow innocent logic is with respect to ontology is also at the heart of\nthe debate about the status of second order logic as logic. Quine\n(1970) argued that second order logic was \u201cset theory in\nsheep\u2019s clothing\u201d, and thus not properly logic at all.\nQuine was concerned with the questions of whether second order\nquantifiers should be understood as ranging over properties or over\nsets of individuals. The former were considered dubious in various\nways, the latter turn second order logic into set theory. This\napproach to second order logic has been extensively criticized by\nvarious authors, most notably George Boolos, who in a series of\npapers, collected in part I of Boolos 1998, attempted to vindicate\nsecond order logic, and to propose a plural interpretation, which is\ndiscussed in the article on\n plural quantification.\n\nA particularly important and pressing case of the ontological\nimplications of logic are logicist programs in the philosophy of\nmathematics, in particular Frege\u2019s conception of logical objects\nand his philosophy of arithmetic. Frege and neo-Fregeans following him\nbelieve that arithmetic is logic (plus definitions) and that numbers\nare objects whose existence is implied by arithmetic. Thus in\nparticular, logic implies the existence of certain objects, and\nnumbers are among them. Frege\u2019s position has been criticized as\nbeing untenable since logic has to be neutral about what there is.\nThus mathematics, or even a part thereof, can\u2019t be both logic\nand about objects. The inconsistency of Frege\u2019s original\nformulation of his position sometimes has been taken to show this, but\nsince consistent formulations of Frege\u2019s philosophy of\narithmetic have surfaced this last point is moot. Frege\u2019s\nargument for numbers as objects and arithmetic as logic is probably\nthe best known argument for logic implying the existence of entities.\nIt has been very carefully investigated in recent years, but whether\nor not it succeeds is controversial. Followers of Frege defend it as\nthe solution to major problems in the philosophy of mathematics; their\ncritics find the argument flawed or even just a cheap trick that is\nobviously going nowhere. We will not discuss the details here, but a\ndetailed presentation of the argument can be found in the entry on\n Frege\u2019s theorem and foundations of arithmetic\n as well as Rosen 1993, which gives a clear and readable\npresentation of the main argument of Wright (1983), which in turn is\npartially responsible for a revival of Fregean ideas along these\nlines. Frege\u2019s own version is in his classic Grundlagen\n(1884). A discussion of recent attempts to revive Frege can be found\nin Hale and Wright 2001, Boolos 1998 and Fine 2002. A discussion\nof Frege\u2019s and Kant\u2019s conceptions of logic is in\nMacFarlane 2002 which also contains many historical references.\n",
