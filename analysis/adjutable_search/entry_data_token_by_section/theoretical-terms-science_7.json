    "main_text": "Formal Accounts\n4. Formal Accounts\n\nA few notational conventions and preliminary considerations are\nnecessary to explain the formal accounts of theoretical terms.\nEssential to all of these accounts is the division of the set of\ndescriptive symbols into a set \\(V_o\\) of observational and another\nset \\(V_t\\) of theoretical terms. (The descriptive symbols of a formal\nlanguage are simply the non-logical ones.) A scientific theory thus be\nformulated in a language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\). The division of the\ndescriptive vocabulary gives rise to a related distinction between\nT- and C-axioms among the axioms of a scientific\ntheory. The T-axioms contain only \\(V_t\\) symbols as\ndescriptive ones, while the C-axioms contain both \\(V_o\\) and\n\\(V_t\\) symbols. The latter axioms establish a connection between the\ntheoretical and the observational terms. TC designates the\nconjunction of T- and C-axioms and \\(A(\\TC)\\) the\nset of these axioms. Let \\(n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k\\) be the elements of\n\\(V_o\\) and \\(t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n\\) the elements of \\(V_t\\). Then,\nTC is a proposition of the following type: \n\n\\[\\tag{\\(\\TC\\)} \\TC(n_1 ,\\ldots ,n_k, t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n).\\]\n\n\nRamsey ([1929] 1931) assumes that there is but one domain of\ninterpretation for all descriptive symbols. Carnap (1956, 1958), by\ncontrast, distinguishes between a domain of interpretation for\nobservational terms and another for theoretical terms. Notably, the\nlatter domain contains exclusively mathematical entities. Ketland\n(2004) has emphasized the importance of distinguishing between an\nobservational and a theoretical domain of interpretation. TC\nis a first-order sentence in Ramsey\u2019s seminal article\n\u201cTheories\u201d ([1929] 1931). Carnap (1956; 1958), however,\nworks with higher-order logic to allow for the formulation of\nmathematical propositions and concepts.\n",
