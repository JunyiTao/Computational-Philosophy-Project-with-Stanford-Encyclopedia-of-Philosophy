    "main_text": "Solving Dynamic Choice Problems || The Arrangement of External Incentives\n2.2 The Arrangement of External Incentives\n\nThe other above-mentioned strategy that is often useful for dealing\nwith certain dynamic choice problems is the arrangement of external\nincentives that make it worthwhile for one\u2019s future self to\ncooperate with one\u2019s current plans. This strategy can be\nparticularly useful in dealing with discounting-induced preference\nreversals. Consider again the agent who wants to save for a decent\nretirement but, as each opportunity to save approaches, prefers to\nspend her potential retirement contribution on just one more trivial\nindulgence before finally tightening her belt for the sake of the\nfuture satisfaction she feels is essential to her well-being. If this\nagent\u2019s plans are consistently thwarted by her\ndiscounting-induced preference reversals, she might come to the\nconclusion that she will never manage to save for a decent retirement\nif she doesn\u2019t supplement her plans with incentives that will\nprevent the preference reversals that are causing her so much trouble.\nIf she is lucky, she may find an existing precommitment device that\nshe can take advantage of. Suppose, for example, that she can sign up\nfor a program at work that, starting in a month, automatically\ndeposits a portion of her pay into a retirement fund. If she cannot\nremove deposited funds without a significant penalty, and if she must\nprovide a month\u2019s notice to discontinue her participation in the\nprogram, signing up for the program might change the cost-and-reward\nstructure of spending her potential retirement contributions on\ntrivial indulgences enough to make this option consistently\ndispreferred. If no ready-made precommitment device is available, she\nmight be able to create a suitable one herself. If, for example, she\nis highly averse to breaking promises, she might be able to solve her\nproblem by simply promising a concerned friend that she will\nhenceforth deposit a certain percentage of her pay into a retirement\nfund.\n\nIn some cases, one might not be confident that one can arrange for\nexternal incentives that will get one\u2019s future self to\nvoluntarily cooperate with one\u2019s current plans. One might\ntherefore favor the related but more extreme strategy of making sure\nthat one\u2019s future self does not have the power to thwart\none\u2019s current plans. Rather than simply making cooperation more\nworthwhile (and thus, in a sense, more compelling), this strategy\ninvolves arranging for the use of force (which compels in a\nstronger sense of the term). A fictional but particularly famous\nemployment of the strategy (which is discussed in, for example, Elster\n1984) is its employment by Odysseus in Homer\u2019s Odyssey.\nBecause he longed to hear the enchanting singing of the Sirens, but\nfeared that he would thereby be lured into danger, Odysseus instructed\nhis companions to tie him to the mast of his ship and to resist his\n(anticipated) attempts at freeing himself from the requested\nbonds.\n",
