Critique of Authenticity\n\nThe idea of autonomy\u2014the view that each individual must decide\nhow to act based on his or her own rational deliberations about the\nbest course of action\u2014has in many ways paved the way for the\nidea of authenticity. However, authenticity goes beyond autonomy by\nholding that an individual\u2019s feelings and deepest desires can\noutweigh both the outcome of rational deliberation in making\ndecisions, and our willingness to immerse ourselves into the reigning\nnorms and values of society. Whereas sincerity generally seems to\naccept a given social order, authenticity becomes an implicitly\ncritical concept, often calling into question the reigning social\norder and public opinion. In Rousseau\u2019s optic, one of our most\nimportant projects is to avert from the social sphere and to unearth\nwhat is truly us underneath the \u2018masks\u2019 that\nsociety forces on us. But when authenticity comes to be regarded as\nsomething like sincerity for its own sake (Ferrara 1993: 86), it\nbecomes increasingly hard to see what the moral good is that it is\nsupposed to bring into being.\n\nA frequently mentioned worry with the ideal of authenticity is that\nthe focus on one\u2019s own inner feelings and attitudes may breed a\nself-centered preoccupation with oneself that is anti-social and\ndestructive of altruism and compassion toward others. Christopher\nLasch (1979) points out similarities between the clinical disorder\nreferred to as Narcissistic Personality Disorder and authenticity.\nAccording to Lasch, narcissism and authenticity are both characterized\nby deficient empathic skills, self-indulgence and self-absorbed\nbehavior. Similarly, Allan Bloom (1987: 61) maintains that the culture\nof authenticity has made the minds of the youth \u201cnarrower and\nflatter,\u201d leading to self-centeredness and the collapse of the\npublic self. While Lasch and Bloom worry about the threat that the\nself-centeredness and narcissism of the \u201cculture of\nauthenticity\u201d poses to morality and political coherence, Daniel\nBell voices worries about its economic viability. What Bell fears is\nthat the \u201cmegalomania of self-infinitization\u201d that comes\nwith the culture of authenticity will erode the foundations of market\nmechanisms that are \u201cbased on a moral system of reward rooted in\nthe Protestant sanctification of work\u201d (Bell 1976: 84). More\nrecently, critics have argued that when properly analyzed,\nauthenticity demands positing the existence of a \u201ctrue\nself.\u201d It requires positing an essentialist structure leading to\nmetaphysical problems that current accounts of authenticity fail to\nsolve (Bialystok 2014). Correspondingly, Feldman (2014) argues in\nfavor of abandoning the ideal of authenticity because it builds on\nconfused assumptions about the self, the value of one\u2019s\n\u201cgut feelings\u201d in revealing one\u2019s values, and the\nsupposedly corrupting influence of the \u201cexternal\u201d social\nrealm (for a critique of this position, see Bauer 2017; Ferrara 2009)\n\n\nHowever, one might argue that this only becomes a problem if one\nthinks of authenticity as entirely a personal virtue. In other words,\nthere is only a clash between morality and social life and being\nauthentic if the \u201ctrue\u201d self is regarded as fundamentally\nprone to anti-social behaviour. But many thinkers at this time\nunderstood human nature as fundamentally disposed toward beneficence,\nso that evil was seen as arising from socialization and upbringing\nrather than from deep drives within the human being. For instance,\nRousseau holds that certain immoral characteristics are immanent in\nman but were produced by the dynamics of modern society, which is\ncharacterized by a competitive way of relating to others and striving\nfor acknowledgement in the public sphere. Rousseau thus externalizes\nthe origins of societal evil and alienation from the original nature\nof man. The undistorted self-relation of natural man inspires sympathy\nand considerate relations with others, sensitive to \u201cseeing any\nsentient being, especially our fellow-man, perish or suffer,\nprincipally those like ourselves\u201d (Rousseau 1992 [1754]: 14). In\nsomewhat the same way, economic theorists of the time supposed that\nunregulated markets are self-correcting, as human beings are naturally\ninclined to engage in mutually advantageous commercial activities\n(Taylor 2007: 221\u2013269). On this view, authenticity does not\namount to egoism or self-absorption. On the contrary, the prevailing\nview seems to have been that, by turning inward and accessing the\n\u201ctrue\u201d self, one is simultaneously led towards a deeper\nengagement with the social world. This is why Taylor (1989:\n419\u2013455) describes the trajectory of the project of authenticity\nis \u201cinward and upward\u201d.\n\nIt might however be objected that supposing that the\n\u201cinner\u201d is a morally worthy guide is deeply misguided and\nbuilds upon an overly optimistic idea of human nature. It may be\nargued that once the idea of rational deliberation is set aside, the\npowerful impact of the non-rational becomes apparent. Thinkers such as\nNietzsche and Freud have put in question the conception of human\nnature, and especially of our \u201cinner\u201d nature, as\nfundamentally good. Following their \u201chermeneutics of\nsuspicion\u201d (Ricoeur 1970), human nature comes to be seen as\nincluding forces of violence, disorder and unreason as well as\ntendencies toward beneficence and altruism. In that case, any idea of\nan ethic based primarily on the ideal of authenticity is simply\nuntenable.\n\nOthers have expressed serious concerns not about the optimistic view\nof human nature, but about the conception of the self that underlies\nthe idea of authenticity. Some argued that the dichotomies that the\nconcept authenticity was built on, like conformity vs. independence,\nindividual vs. society, or inner-directedness vs. other-directedness,\nwere entirely misguided. The underlying assumption that considers the\nindividual separate from the environment is an absurd assumption that\nerodes that bond between the individual and community, which\nultimately is the source of the authentic self (Slater 1970: 15; Sisk\n1973). In agreement with Slater (1970) and Yankelovich (1981), Bellah\net al. (1985) and Fairlie (1978) contend that such a pursuit of\nauthenticity is self-defeating, for with the loss of the bond with\ncommunity, the sense of self is also diminished.\n\nAdditionally, in The Jargon of Authenticity, Adorno contended\nthat the \u201cliturgy of inwardness\u201d is founded on the flawed\nidea of a self-transparent individual who is capable of choosing\nherself (Adorno 1973: 70). The doubtful picture of the self-centered\nindividual covers up the constitutive alterity and mimetic nature of\nthe self. In the concluding part of The Order of Things,\nFoucault maintained that present society was witnessing a crisis, not\nonly of authenticity but also of the whole idea of the subject in its\ntemporary historically contingent constitution, foreseeing that\n\u201cman would be erased, like a face drawn in sand at the edge of\nthe sea\u201d (Foucault 1994: 387). Foucault clearly opposed the idea\nof a hidden authentic self, which he critically referred to as the\n\u201cCalifornian cult of the self\u201d (1983: 266). The\nrecognition that the subject is not given to itself in advance leads\nhim to the practical consequence that it must create itself as a work\nof art (Foucault 1983: 392). Rather than searching for a hidden true\nself, one should attempt to shape one\u2019s life as a work of art,\nproceeding without recourse to any fixed rules or permanent truths in\na process of unending becoming (Foucault 1988: 49). In a similar vein,\nRichard Rorty has argued that the idea of coming to \u201cknow a\ntruth which was out there (or in here) all the time\u201d (Rorty\n1989: 27) is simply a myth. Postmodern thought raises questions about\nthe existence of an underlying subject with essential properties\naccessible through introspection. The whole idea of the authentic as\nthat which is \u201coriginal\u201d, \u201cessential\u201d,\n\u201cproper\u201d, and so forth now seems doubtful. If we are\nself-constituting beings who make ourselves up from one moment to the\nnext, it appears that the term \u201cauthenticity\u201d can refer\nonly to whatever feels right at some particular moment.\n\nYet others have based their criticism of authenticity especially on\nthe emergence of a pervasive \u201cculture of authenticity\u201d.\nCultural critics have argued that the ostensible \u201cdecline\u201d\nof modern society might not primarily be a result of economical or\nstructural transformations, but as the outcome of an increasingly\nubiquitous ideal of authenticity. Before we turn to these critiques,\nit is helpful to understand how the ideal of authenticity became so\nwidespread. First, we should mention that Rousseau\u2019s work, made\na significant contribution to the popularization of authenticity.\nIndeed, some argue that authenticity can be seen as a\n\u201ckeystone\u201d in Rousseau\u2019s work, giving unity to his\nreflections on sociality, political order, and education (Ferrara\n2017: 2). Particularly The New Heloise (1997 [1761]) was\nenormously influential, with at least 70 editions in print before 1800\n(Darnton 1984: 242). This dispersion of the ideal of authenticity into\npopular culture was further strengthened by several factors. For\ninstance, a wide array of intellectuals of the nineteenth and the\nearly twentieth century had embraced the idea of authenticity, and\neven radicalized it by resisting established codes and publicly\ndefending alternative, \u201cartistic\u201d or\n\u201cbohemian\u201d modes of life.\n\nThe reception of the work of Sartre and Heidegger has surely\ncontributed to the popularization of the idea of authenticity, and the\ndecisive impact of this idea first began to manifest itself after the\nSecond World War (Taylor 2007: 475). Rossinow contends that the\npolitics of the 1960s were centered on questions of authenticity.\nFollowing his account, the main driving force towards political and\nsocial changes of the New Left movement in the 1960s was \u201ca\nsearch for authenticity in industrial American life\u201d (Rossinow\n1998: 345). Both J. Farrell (1997) and Rossinow argue that the New\nLeft emerged partly as a reaction to traditional American liberalism\nand Christian existentialism, replacing the negative concept of\n\u201csin\u201d with \u201calienation\u201d and the positive goal\nof \u201csalvation\u201d with that of \u201cauthenticity\u201d.\nConfronted with what they understood as alienation that\n\u201cisn\u2019t restricted to the poor\u201d (Rossinow 1998: 194),\nNew Left activism reached beyond civil rights to moral rights and\nattempted to bring about a recovery of a sense of personal wholeness\nand authenticity by curing the institutions of American society.\n\nThe emerging youth culture was characterized by a severe\ndissatisfaction with the \u201cmorass of conformity\u201d of the\nparental generation (Gray 1965: 57). The critique of the growing\nconformity of life got more persistent during the 1950s, and a number\nof social scientists in widely read books criticized what they saw as\nwidespread conformity and inauthenticity. Among these, The Lonely\nCrowd (1950) by Riesman and The Organization Man (1956)\nby Whyte received the most attention. Riesman points out that the\nefficacious functioning of modern organizations requires\nother-directed individuals who smoothly adjust to their environment.\nHowever, he also notes that such people compromised themselves, and a\nsociety consisting mostly of other-directed individuals faces\nsubstantial deficiencies in leadership and human potential.\n\nOn the background of this development, it seems that at a time when\nrelativism appears difficult to surmount, authenticity has become a\nlast measure of value and a common currency in contemporary cultural\nlife (Jay 2004). So, under the impact of existentialism on Western\nculture, the ubiquitous desire for authenticity has emerged in modern\nsociety as \u201cone of the most politically explosive of human\nimpulses,\u201d as Marshall Berman argues (1970: xix). \n",
