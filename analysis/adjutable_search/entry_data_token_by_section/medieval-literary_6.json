The De Fallaciis attributed to\nAquinas defines a disputed question as a set of syllogistic arguments\non different sides of a question to be resolved (Baz\u00e1n 1985,\n22). Baz\u00e1n gives a more complete definition as follows:\n\u201ca disputed question is a regular form of teaching,\napprenticeship and research, presided over by a master, characterized\nby a dialectical method which consists of bringing forward and\nexamining arguments based on reason and authority which oppose one\nanother on a given theoretical or practical problem and which are\nfurnished by participants, and where the master must come to a\ndoctrinal solution by an act of determination which confirms him in\nhis function as master\u201d (Baz\u00e1n 1985, 40). Disputations\ntook place both privately between a master and his students, and\npublicly or \u201csolemnly\u201d at an event that replaced regular\nclasses at the university and was attended by the larger university\ncommunity. The latter practice was eventually codified by university\nstatute, which prescribed that masters would hold a certain number of\ndisputations at various times of the year, sometimes as frequently as\nonce a week. Most scholars agree that the process came to be divided\ninto two sessions. In the first session, supporting and opposing\narguments for a given thesis or question were brought forward, and, in\na preliminary way, clarified and determined by a student serving as\nthe respondens under the supervision of the master. During\nthe second session, the master himself would make the determination,\ngive his answer and respond to all the opposing arguments. Some\ndisputed questions we have in written form are clearly taken from the\ndifferent stages in this process, either a reportatio of the\nfirst day\u2019s session, some abbreviation of the debate, or one\nreflecting the master\u2019s answer and response to opposing\nobjections, redacted after the second day\u2019s debate.\n\nDisputation arises out of and is an academic formalization of the\nphilosophical dialogue (Novikoff 2012) and comes into the classroom as\nan outgrowth of the lectio, the careful reading and\ncommentary on authoritative texts (Kenny and Pinborg 1982,\n20\u201325). This type of reading involved the consultation of\nauthoritative sources on those texts. From the differences among\nsources came the need to resolve such differences, a process\neventually formalized into the posing of a question. A question is\ntied to a specific textual problem or conflict, but has, like the\ndisputation, arguments on opposing sides and the response or\nresolution and replies to opposite objections by the master. The\ndisputation is centered around a systematic rather than a textual\nquestion, and the supporting and opposing arguments are supplied by\nstudents.\n\nA special form of disputation, quodlibetal (quodlibet = any,\nwhatever) questions, differed from ordinary disputations in that they\nwere open to the broader public \u2014 other masters, students from\nother schools, other church and civil authorities \u2014 and took\nplace only during Advent and Lent. The questions were not set by the\nmaster but could be posed by any member of the audience and without\nany prior notice to the master who would determine the question. These\nquestions might reflect contemporary controversies or might be\ndesigned to pose a question that brought to the fore a difficulty for\nthe particular master of whom it was asked because of his other stated\nviews. The popularity of these public spectacles shows the importance\nand influence of scholastic disputation on the larger culture.\n(Novikoff 2012, 2013).\n\nAn important function of the master in both quodlibetal and disputed\nquestions is the determinatio, in which the master ordered\nthe various smaller questions into articles of a given question. Like\nthe division of the text that is part of the work of commentary, this\nstrategy involves both making distinctions, for which medieval\nscholastics are well-known, but also a synthesis, finding the unity of\na text and the unity of a set of diverse questions under larger\nquestions in the disputation. The collections that have been made of\nthe quodlibetal literature show how diverse the questions posed were\nand how much less unified the treatment (Glorieux 1925\u201335;\nSchabel 2006\u20137). We can also see, by contrast, how much more a\nmatter of literary art the more unified and organized disputed\nquestions are that are based on questions set by and organized in\nsequence by a master.\n\nAll of these forms, disputation, quaestio, and quodlibetal\nquestion, represent what has been called \u201cthe\ninstitutionalization of conflict\u201d in medieval intellectual life.\nRaising questions or objections about anything from basic matters of\nChristian belief \u2014 the existence of God, the coherence of the\ndoctrine of the Trinity \u2014 to important contemporary\ncontroversies \u2014 the power of the papacy or secular princes,\necclesiastical corruption \u2014 was not only permitted but\nencouraged as part of the structure of university life. Thus, there\nwas an important kind of intellectual and academic freedom enshrined\nin these practices of formal and public debate. On the other hand,\nthose questions were also in some ways controlled exactly because they\nwere brought into an existing institution and structured in a\nparticular way. Thus, the questions, even though asked, were in\nanother way made less dangerous and subversive by being posed and\ncontrolled from within the university, which itself operated under the\nwatchful eye of the Church. (For a study of the ways in which medieval\nphilosophical disputation made its way out of the university,\naffecting the larger culture, see Novikoff 2013.)\n\nThe disputation also develops in a different direction within the\nuniversities, into forms whose function was training in argumentative\ntechniques in which the goal is besting an opponent. Different forms\ndeveloped, with different rules for the opponent and respondent. In\nthe better known ars obligatoria, the opponent poses a\nquestion and the respondent answers, while in another form, the\nopponent constructs arguments to refute something held by the\nrespondent, and the respondent must react to the opponent\u2019s\nclaims (Angellelli 1970; P\u00e9rez-Ilzarbe 2011, 130\u20131).
