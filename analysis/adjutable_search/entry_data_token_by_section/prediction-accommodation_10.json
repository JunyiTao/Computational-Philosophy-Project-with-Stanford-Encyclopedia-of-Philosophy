    "main_text": "The Null Support Thesis || The Archer Analogy\n6.6 The Archer Analogy\n\nA common argument for predictivism is that we should avoid inferring\nthat a theory T is true on the basis of evidence E that\nit is built to fit because we can explain why T entails\nE by simply noting how T was built\u2014but if T\nwas not built to fit E then only the truth of T can\nexplain the fact that T fits E. Various philosophers\nhave noted that this reasoning is fallacious. As noted above it makes\nno sense to offer an explanation (for example, in terms of how the\ntheory was built) for the fact that T entails\nE\u2014for this latter fact is a logical fact for which no\ncausal explanation can be given. Insofar as there is an\nexplanandum in need of an explanans here it is\nrather the fact that the theorist managed to construct or\n\u2018choose\u2019 a theory (which turned out to be T) that\ncorrectly entailed E (Collins 1994; Barnes 2002)\u2014that\nexplanandum could be explained by noting that the theorist\nbuilt a theory (which turned out to be T) to fit E, or\nendorsed it because it fit E. \n\nWhite (2003) offers a theory of predictivism that begins with this\nsame insight\u2014the relevant explanandum is:\n\n(ES) The theorist\nselected a datum-entailing theory.\n\n\nThis explanandum could be explained in one of two ways:\n\n(DS)The theorist\ndesigned her theory to entail the datum.\n(RA) The\ntheorist\u2019s selection of her theory was reliably aimed at the\ntruth.\n\n\nWhite explains that (RA) means \u201croughly that the mechanisms\nwhich led to her selection of a theory gave her a good chance of\narriving at the truth\u201d (2003: 664). (Thus White analogizes the\ntheorist to an \u2018archer\u2019 who is more or less reliable in\n\u2018aiming\u2019 at the truth in selecting a theory.) Then White\noffers a simple argument for predictivism: assuming ~DS, ES provides\nevidence for RA. But assuming DS, ES provides no evidence for RA.\nThus, heuristic predictivism is true.\n\nInterestingly, White bills his account as a strong heuristic account.\nIn making this claim he is claiming that the epistemic advantage of\nprediction would not be entirely erased for an observer who was\ncompletely aware of all relevant evidence and background knowledge\npossessed by the scientific community at the relevant point in time.\nThis is because the degree to which theorizing is reliable depends\nupon principles of evidence assessment and causal relations (including\nthe reliability of our perceptual faculties, accuracy of measuring\ninstruments, etc.) that are not entirely \u201ctransparent\u201d to\n us.[12]\n Insofar as fully informed scientists may not be fully convinced of\njust how reliable these principles and relations are, evidence that\nthey lead to the endorsement of theories which are predictively\nsuccessful continues to redound to their assessed reliability. Thus,\nWhite concludes, strong heuristic predictivism is vindicated (2003:\n671\u20134). \n",
