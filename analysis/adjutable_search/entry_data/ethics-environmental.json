    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction: The Challenge of Environmental Ethics\n\nSuppose putting out natural fires, culling feral animals or removing\nsome individual members of overpopulated species is necessary for the\nprotection of the integrity of a certain ecosystem. Will these actions\nbe morally permissible or even required? Is it morally acceptable for\nfarmers in non-industrial countries to practise slash and burn\ntechniques to clear areas for agriculture? Consider a mining company\nwhich has performed open pit mining in some previously unspoiled area.\nDoes the company have a moral obligation to restore the landform and\nsurface ecology? And what is the value of a humanly restored\nenvironment compared with the originally natural environment? Many\npeople think that it is morally wrong for human beings to pollute and\ndestroy parts of the natural environment and to consume a huge\nproportion of the planet\u2019s natural resources. If that is wrong,\nis it simply because a sustainable environment is essential to human\nexistence and well-being? Or is such behaviour also wrong because the\nnatural environment and/or its various contents have certain values in\ntheir own right so that these values ought to be respected and\nprotected in any case? These are among the questions investigated by\nenvironmental ethics. Some of them are specific questions faced by\nindividuals in particular circumstances, while others are more global\nquestions faced by groups and communities. Yet others are more\nabstract questions concerning the value and moral standing of the\nnatural environment and its non-human components.\n\nIn the literature on environmental ethics the distinction between\ninstrumental value and\n intrinsic value\n (in the sense of \u201cnon-instrumental value\u201d) is of\nconsiderable importance. The former is the value of things as\nmeans to further some other ends, whereas the latter is the\nvalue of things as ends in themselves regardless of whether\nthey are also useful as means to other ends. For instance, certain\nfruits have instrumental value for bats who feed on them, since\nfeeding on the fruits is a means to survival for the bats. However, it\nis not widely agreed that fruits have value as ends in themselves. We\ncan likewise think of a person who teaches others as having\ninstrumental value for those who want to acquire knowledge. Yet, in\naddition to any such value, it is normally said that a person, as a\nperson, has intrinsic value, i.e., value in their own right\nindependently of their prospects for serving the ends of others. For\nanother example, a certain wild plant may have instrumental value\nbecause it provides the ingredients for some medicine or as an\naesthetic object for human observers. But if the plant also has some\nvalue in itself independently of its prospects for furthering some\nother ends such as human health, or the pleasure from aesthetic\nexperience, then the plant also has intrinsic value. Because the\nintrinsically valuable is that which is good as an end in itself, it\nis commonly agreed that something\u2019s possession of intrinsic\nvalue generates a prima facie direct moral duty on the part of moral\nagents to protect it or at least refrain from damaging it (see\nO\u2019Neil 1992 and Jamieson 2002 for detailed accounts of intrinsic\nvalue).\n\nMany traditional western ethical perspectives, however, are\nanthropocentric or human-centered in that either they assign\nintrinsic value to human beings alone (i.e., what we might call\nanthropocentric in a strong sense) or they assign a\nsignificantly greater amount of intrinsic value to human beings than\nto any non-human things such that the protection or promotion of human\ninterests or well-being at the expense of non-human things turns out\nto be nearly always justified (i.e., what we might call\nanthropocentric in a weak sense). For example, Aristotle\n(Politics, Bk. 1, Ch. 8) apparently maintains that\n\u201cnature has made all things specifically for the sake of\nman\u201d. Such purposive or teleological thinking may encourage the\nbelief that the value of non-human things in nature is merely\ninstrumental. It is difficult for anthropocentric positions to\narticulate what is wrong with the cruel treatment of non-human\nanimals, except to the extent that such treatment may lead to bad\nconsequences for human beings. Immanuel Kant (\u201cDuties to Animals\nand Spirits\u201d, in Lectures on Ethics), for instance,\nsuggests that cruelty towards a dog might encourage a person to\ndevelop a character which would be desensitized to cruelty towards\nhumans. From this standpoint, cruelty towards non-human animals would\nbe instrumentally, rather than intrinsically, wrong. Likewise,\nanthropocentrism often recognizes some non-intrinsic wrongness of\nanthropogenic (i.e. human-caused) environmental devastation. Such\ndestruction might damage the well-being of human beings now and in the\nfuture, since our very existence and well-being is essentially\ndependent on a sustainable environment. This argument was made in the\nprevious century (see Passmore 1974; Bookchin 1990; Norton et\nal. (eds.) 1995), and seems subsequently to have garnered wide\npublic support (see the results of surveys in Pew 2018).\n\nWhen environmental ethics emerged as a new sub-discipline of\nphilosophy in the early 1970s, it did so by posing a challenge to\ntraditional anthropocentrism. In the first place, it questioned the\nassumed moral superiority of human beings to members of other species\non earth. In the second place, it investigated the possibility of\nrational arguments for assigning intrinsic value to the natural\nenvironment and its non-human contents. It should be noted, however,\nthat some theorists working in the field see no need to develop new,\nnon-anthropocentric theories. Instead, they advocate what may be\ncalled enlightened anthropocentrism (or, perhaps more\nappropriately called, prudential anthropocentrism). Briefly,\nthis is the view that all the moral duties we have towards the\nenvironment are derived from our direct duties to its human\ninhabitants. The practical purpose of environmental ethics, they\nmaintain, is to provide moral grounds for social policies aimed at\nprotecting the earth\u2019s environment and remedying environmental\ndegradation. Enlightened anthropocentrism, they argue, is sufficient\nfor that practical purpose, and perhaps even more effective in\ndelivering pragmatic outcomes, in terms of policy-making, than\nnon-anthropocentric theories given the theoretical burden on the\nlatter to provide sound arguments for its more radical view that the\nnon-human environment has intrinsic value (cf. Norton 1991, de Shalit\n1994, Light and Katz 1996). Furthermore, some prudential\nanthropocentrists may hold what might be called cynical\nanthropocentrism, which says that we have a higher-level\nanthropocentric reason to be non-anthropocentric in our day-to-day\nthinking. Suppose that a day-to-day non-anthropocentrist tends to act\nmore benignly towards the non-human environment on which human\nwell-being depends. This would provide reason for encouraging\nnon-anthropocentric thinking, even to those who find the idea of\nnon-anthropocentric intrinsic value hard to swallow. In order for such\na strategy to be effective one may need to hide one\u2019s cynical\nanthropocentrism from others and even from oneself. The position can\nbe structurally compared to some indirect form of\n consequentialism\n and may attract parallel critiques (see\n Henry Sidgwick\n on utilitarianism and esoteric morality, and\n Bernard Williams\n on indirect utilitarianism).\n2. The Development of Environmental Ethics\n\nAlthough nature was the focus of much nineteenth and twentieth century\nphilosophy, contemporary environmental ethics only emerged as an\nacademic discipline in the 1970s. The questioning and rethinking of\nthe relationship of human beings with the natural environment over the\nlast thirty years reflected an already widespread perception in the\n1960s that the late twentieth century faced a human population\nexplosion as part of a serious environmental crisis. Among the\naccessible work that drew attention to a sense of crisis was Rachel\nCarson\u2019s Silent Spring (1963), which consisted of a\nnumber of essays earlier published in the New Yorker magazine\ndetailing how pesticides such as DDT, aldrin and dieldrin concentrated\nthrough the food web. Commercial farming practices using these\nchemicals to maximize crop yields and profits, Carson speculates, are\ncapable of impacting simultaneously on environmental and public\nhealth. Their use, she claims, can have the side effects of killing\nother living things (besides the targeted insects) and causing human\ndisease. While Carson correctly fears that over-use of pesticides may\nlead to increases in some resistant insect species, the\nintensification of agriculture, land-clearing and massive use of\nneonicotonoid pesticides has subsequently contributed to a situation\nin which, according to some reviews, nearly half of insect species are\nthreatened with extinction (S\u00e1nchez-Bayo and Wickhuys 2019, and\ncompare van der Sluijs and Vaage 2016, Komonen, Halme and Kotiaho\n2019). Declines in insect populations not only threaten pollination of\nplant species, but may also be responsible for huge declines in some\nbird populations (Goulson 2021) and appear to go hand in hand with\ncascading extinctions across ecosystems worldwide (Kehoe, Frago and\nSanders 2021).\n\nIn a much cited essay (White 1967) on the historical roots of the\nenvironmental crisis, historian Lynn White argued that the main\nstrands of Judeo-Christian thinking had encouraged the\noverexploitation of nature by maintaining the superiority of humans\nover all other forms of life on earth, and by depicting all of nature\nas created for the use of humans. White\u2019s thesis was widely\ndiscussed in theology, history, and has been subject to some\nsociological testing as well as being regularly discussed by\nphilosophers (see Whitney 1993, Attfield 2001). Central to the\nrationale for his thesis were the works of the Church Fathers and The\nBible itself, supporting the anthropocentric perspective that humans\nare the only things on Earth that matter in themselves. Consequently,\nthey may utilize and consume everything else to their advantage\nwithout any injustice. For example, Genesis 1: 27\u20138\nstates: \u201cGod created man in his own image, in the image of God\ncreated he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them,\nand God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the\nearth, and subdue it: and have dominion over fish of the sea, and over\nfowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the\nearth.\u201d Likewise, Thomas Aquinas (Summa Contra\nGentiles, Bk. 3, Pt 2, Ch 112) argued that non-human animals are\n\u201cordered to man\u2019s use\u201d. According to White, the\nJudeo-Christian idea that humans are created in the image of the\ntranscendent supernatural God, who is radically separate from nature,\nalso by extension radically separates humans themselves from nature.\nThis ideology further opened the way for untrammeled exploitation of\nnature. Modern Western science itself, White argued, was \u201ccast\nin the matrix of Christian theology\u201d so that it too inherited\nthe \u201corthodox Christian arrogance toward nature\u201d (White\n1967: 1207). Clearly, without technology and science, the\nenvironmental extremes to which we are now exposed would probably not\nbe realized. The point of White\u2019s thesis, however, is that given\nthe modern form of science and technology, Judeo-Christianity itself\nprovides the original deep-seated drive to unlimited exploitation of\nnature. Nevertheless, White argued that some minority traditions\nwithin Christianity (e.g., the views of St. Francis) might provide an\nantidote to the \u201carrogance\u201d of a mainstream tradition\nsteeped in anthropocentrism. This sentiment is echoed in later\nChristian writings on attitudes to nature (see for example Berry 2018,\nchs 10, 11, and compare Zaheva and Szasz 2015).\n\nAround the same time, the Stanford ecologists Paul and Anne Ehrlich\nwarned in The Population Bomb (Ehrlich 1968) that the growth\nof human population threatened the viability of planetary life-support\nsystems. The sense of environmental crisis stimulated by those and\nother popular works was intensified by NASA\u2019s production and\nwide dissemination of a particularly potent image of Earth from space\ntaken at Christmas 1968 and featured in the Scientific\nAmerican in September 1970. Here, plain to see, was a living,\nshining planet voyaging through space and shared by all of humanity, a\nprecious vessel vulnerable to pollution and to the overuse of its\nlimited capacities. In 1972 a team of researchers at MIT led by Donella\nMeadows published the Limits to Growth study, a work that\nsummed up in many ways the emerging concerns of the previous decade\nand the sense of vulnerability triggered by the view of the earth from\nspace. In the commentary to the study, the researchers wrote:\n\nWe affirm finally that any deliberate attempt to reach a rational and\nenduring state of equilibrium by planned measures, rather than by\nchance or catastrophe, must ultimately be founded on a basic change of\nvalues and goals at individual, national and world levels. (Meadows et\nal. 1972: 195)\n\n\nThe call for a \u201cbasic change of values\u201d in connection to\nthe environment (a call that could be interpreted in terms of either\ninstrumental or intrinsic values) reflected a need for the development\nof environmental ethics as a new sub-discipline of philosophy. The aim\nof facing up to the challenge of limited resources was fostered\nsubsequently by studies of the growing human \u201cecological\nfootprint\u201d on the earth (Rees 1992, Wackernagel et al.\n2018) and by the exploration of \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d and\nthe concept of a \u201csafe operating space for humanity\u201d\n(Rokstr\u00f6m et al. 2009, Biermann and Kim 2020).\n\nThe new field emerged almost simultaneously in three\ncountries\u2014the United States, Australia, and Norway. In the first\ntwo of these countries, direction and inspiration largely came from\nthe earlier twentieth century American literature of the environment.\nFor instance, the Scottish emigrant John Muir (founder of the Sierra\nClub and \u201cfather of American conservation\u201d) and\nsubsequently the forester Aldo Leopold had advocated an appreciation\nand conservation of things \u201cnatural, wild and free\u201d. Their\nconcerns were motivated by a combination of ethical and aesthetic\nresponses to nature as well as a rejection of crudely economic\napproaches to the value of natural objects (a historical survey of the\nconfrontation between Muir\u2019s reverentialism and the\nhuman-centred conservationism of Gifford Pinchot (one of the major\ninfluences on the development of the US Forest Service) is provided in\nNorton 1991; also see Cohen 1984 and Nash (ed) 1990). Leopold\u2019s\nA Sand County Almanac (1949), in particular, advocated the\nadoption of a \u201cland ethic\u201d:\n\nThat land is a community is the basic concept of ecology, but that\nland is to be loved and respected is an extension of ethics. (Leopold\n1949: vii\u2013ix)\n\n\nA thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability,\nand beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends\notherwise. (Leopold 1949: 224\u20135)\n\n\nHowever, Leopold himself provided no systematic ethical theory or\nframework to support these ethical ideas concerning the environment.\nHis views therefore presented a challenge and opportunity for moral\ntheorists: could some ethical theory be devised to justify the\ninjunction to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the\nbiosphere?\n\nThe land ethic sketched by Leopold, attempting to extend our moral\nconcern to cover the natural environment and its non-human contents,\nwas drawn on explicitly by the Australian philosopher Richard Routley\n(later Sylvan). According to Routley (1973 (cf. Routley and Routley\n1980)), the anthropocentrism imbedded in what he called the\n\u201cdominant western view\u201d, or \u201cthe western\nsuperethic\u201d, is in effect \u201chuman chauvinism\u201d. This\nview, he argued, is just another form of class chauvinism, which is\nsimply based on blind class \u201cloyalty\u201d or prejudice, and\nunjustifiably discriminates against those outside the privileged\nclass. Echoing the plot of a popular movie some three years earlier\n(see Lo and Brennan 2013), Routley speculates in his \u201clast\nman\u201d (and \u201clast people\u201d) arguments about a\nhypothetical situation in which the last person, surviving a world\ncatastrophe, acts to ensure the elimination of all other living things\nand the last people set about destroying forests and ecosystems after\ntheir demise. From the human-chauvinistic (or absolutely\nanthropocentric) perspective, the last person would do nothing morally\nwrong, since his or her destructive act in question would not cause\nany damage to the interests and well-being of humans, who would by\nthen have disappeared. Nevertheless, Routley points out that there is\na moral intuition that the imagined last acts would be morally wrong.\nAn explanation for this judgment, he argues, is that those non-human\nobjects in the environment, whose destruction is ensured by the last\nperson or last people, have intrinsic value, a kind of value\nindependent of their usefulness for humans. From his critique, Routley\nconcluded that the main approaches in traditional western moral\nthinking were unable to allow the recognition that natural things have\nintrinsic value, and that the tradition required overhaul of a\nsignificant kind.\n\nLeopold\u2019s idea that the \u201cland\u201d as a whole is an\nobject of our moral concern also stimulated writers to argue for\ncertain moral obligations toward ecological wholes, such as species,\ncommunities, and ecosystems, not just their individual constituents.\nThe U.S.-based theologian and environmental philosopher Holmes Rolston\nIII, for instance, argued that species protection was a moral duty\n(Rolston 1975). It would be wrong, he maintained, to eliminate a rare\nbutterfly species simply to increase the monetary value of specimens\nalready held by collectors. Like Routley\u2019s \u201clast\nman\u201d arguments, Rolston\u2019s example is meant to draw\nattention to a kind of action that seems morally dubious and yet is\nnot clearly ruled out or condemned by traditional anthropocentric\nethical views. Species, Rolston went on to argue, are intrinsically\nvaluable and are usually more valuable than individual specimens,\nsince the loss of a species is a loss of genetic possibilities and the\ndeliberate destruction of a species would show disrespect for the very\nbiological processes which make possible the emergence of individual\nliving things (also see Rolston 1989, Ch 10). Natural processes\ndeserve respect, according to Rolston\u2019s quasi-religious\nperspective, because they constitute a nature (or God) which is itself\nintrinsically valuable (or sacred).\n\nMeanwhile, the work of Christopher Stone (a professor of law at the\nUniversity of Southern California) had become widely discussed. Stone\n(1972) proposes that trees and other natural objects should have at\nleast the same standing in law as corporations. This suggestion was\ninspired by a particular case in which the Sierra Club had mounted a\nchallenge against the permit granted by the U.S. Forest Service to\nWalt Disney Enterprises for surveys preparatory to the development of\nthe Mineral King Valley, which was at the time a relatively remote\ngame refuge, but not designated as a national park or protected\nwilderness area. The Disney proposal was to develop a major resort\ncomplex serving 14000 visitors daily to be accessed by a purpose-built\nhighway through Sequoia National Park. The Sierra Club, as a body with\na general concern for wilderness conservation, challenged the\ndevelopment on the grounds that the valley should be kept in its\noriginal state for its own sake.\n\nStone reasoned that if trees, forests and mountains could be given\nstanding in law then they could be represented in their own right in\nthe courts by groups such as the Sierra Club. Moreover, like any other\nlegal person, these natural things could become beneficiaries\nof compensation if it could be shown that they had suffered\ncompensatable injury through human activity. When the case went to the\nU.S. Supreme Court, it was determined by a narrow majority that the\nSierra Club did not meet the condition for bringing a case to court,\nfor the Club was unable and unwilling to prove the likelihood of\ninjury to the interest of the Club or its members. In dissenting\nminority judgments, however, justices Douglas, Blackmun and Brennan\nmentioned Stone\u2019s argument: his proposal to give legal standing\nto natural things, they said, would allow conservation interests,\ncommunity needs and business interests to be represented, debated and\nsettled in court. Stone\u2019s work was later cited in the successful\narguments to grant personhood to rivers and other natural features in\nvarious parts of the world. In some of these cases, Stone\u2019s\narguments\u2014along with those of Arne N\u00e6ss (see\nbelow)\u2014have been said to provide analogues to indigenous\nunderstandings of the intrinsic value of the land and the\ninterconnections of such understandings with human actions and\nancestral spirituality (Morris and Ruru 2010, Kramm 2020). Similar\nsuggestions have also been made about Leopold\u2019s work, but such\nclaims need to be interpreted with caution (White 2015).\n\nReacting to Stone\u2019s proposal, Joel Feinberg (1974) raised a\nserious problem. Only items that have interests, Feinberg argued, can\nbe regarded as having legal standing and, likewise, moral standing.\nFor it is interests which are capable of being represented in legal\nproceedings and moral debates. This same point would also seem to\napply to political debates. For instance, the movement for\n\u201canimal liberation\u201d, which also emerged strongly in the\n1970s, can be thought of as a political movement aimed at representing\nthe previously neglected interests of some animals (see Regan and\nSinger (eds.) 1976, Clark 1977, and also the entry on\n the moral status of animals).\n Granted that some animals have interests that can be represented in\nthis way, would it also make sense to speak of trees, forests, rivers,\nbarnacles, or termites as having interests of a morally relevant kind?\nThis issue was hotly contested in the years that followed. Meanwhile,\nJohn Passmore (1974) argued, like White, that the Judeo-Christian\ntradition of thought about nature, despite being predominantly\n\u201cdespotic\u201d, contained resources for regarding humans as\n\u201cstewards\u201d or \u201cperfectors\u201d of God\u2019s\ncreation. Skeptical of the prospects for any radically new ethic,\nPassmore cautioned that traditions of thought could not be abruptly\noverhauled. Any change in attitudes to our natural surroundings which\nstood the chance of widespread acceptance, he argued, would have to\nresonate and have some continuities with the very tradition which had\nlegitimized our destructive practices.\n\nIn sum, then, Leopold\u2019s land ethic, the historical analyses of\nWhite and Passmore, the pioneering work of Routley, Stone and Rolston,\nand the warnings of scientists, had by the late 1970s focused the\nattention of philosophers and political theorists firmly on the\nenvironment. The confluence of ethical, political and legal debates\nabout the environment, the emergence of philosophies to underpin\nanimal rights activism and the puzzles over whether an environmental\nethic would be something new rather than a modification or extension\nof existing ethical theories were reflected in wider social and\npolitical movements. The rise of environmental or \u201cgreen\u201d\nparties in Europe in the 1980s was accompanied by almost immediate\nschisms between groups known as \u201crealists\u201d versus\n\u201cfundamentalists\u201d (see Dobson 1990). The\n\u201crealists\u201d stood for reform environmentalism, working with\nbusiness and government to soften the impact of pollution and resource\ndepletion especially on fragile ecosystems or endangered species. The\n\u201cfundies\u201d argued for radical change, the setting of\nstringent new priorities, and even the overthrow of capitalism and\nliberal individualism, which were taken as the major ideological\ncauses of anthropogenic environmental devastation. It is not clear,\nhowever, that collectivist or communist countries do particularly well\nin terms of their environmental record (see Dominick 1998). At the\nsame time, the rise of \u201cenvironmental authoritarianism\u201d in\nsome non-democratic countries appears to show that liberal democracies\nmay not have a monopoly on effective action to support sustainability\nand biodiversity (Beeson 2010, Shahar 2015).\n\nUnderlying these political disagreements was the distinction between\n\u201cshallow\u201d and \u201cdeep\u201d environmental movements,\na distinction introduced in the early 1970s by another major influence\non contemporary environmental ethics, the Norwegian philosopher and\nclimber Arne N\u00e6ss. Since the work of N\u00e6ss has been\nsignificant in environmental politics, the discussion of his position\nis given in a separate section below.\n3. Environmental Ethics and Politics\n3.1 Deep Ecology\n\n\u201cDeep ecology\u201d was born in Scandinavia, the result of\ndiscussions between N\u00e6ss and his colleagues Sigmund\nKval\u00f8y and Nils Faarlund (see N\u00e6ss 1973 and 1989; also\nsee Witoszek and Brennan (eds.) 1999 for a historical survey and\ncommentary on the development of deep ecology). All three shared a\npassion for the great mountains. On a visit to the Himalayas, they\nbecame impressed with aspects of \u201cSherpa culture\u201d\nparticularly when they found that their Sherpa guides regarded certain\nmountains as sacred and accordingly would not venture onto them.\nSubsequently, N\u00e6ss formulated a position which extended the\nreverence the three Norwegians and the Sherpas felt for mountains to\nother natural things in general.\n\nThe \u201cshallow ecology movement\u201d, as N\u00e6ss (1973) calls\nit, is the \u201cfight against pollution and resource\ndepletion\u201d, the central objective of which is \u201cthe health\nand affluence of people in the developed countries.\u201d The\n\u201cdeep ecology movement\u201d, in contrast, endorses\n\u201cbiospheric egalitarianism\u201d, the view that all living\nthings are alike in having value in their own right, independent of\ntheir usefulness to others. The deep ecologist respects this intrinsic\nvalue, taking care, for example, when walking on the mountainside not\nto cause unnecessary damage to the plants.\n\nInspired by Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics, another key feature of\nN\u00e6ss\u2019s deep ecology is the rejection of atomistic\nindividualism. The idea that a human being is such an individual\npossessing a separate essence, N\u00e6ss argues, radically separates\nthe human self from the rest of the world. To make such a separation\nnot only leads to selfishness towards other people, but also induces\nhuman selfishness towards nature. As a counter to egoism at both the\nindividual and species level, N\u00e6ss proposes an alternative\nrelational \u201ctotal-field image\u201d of the world.\nAccording to this relationalism, organisms (human or otherwise) are\nbest understood as \u201cknots\u201d in the biospherical net. The\nidentity of a living thing is essentially constituted by its relations\nto other things in the world, especially its ecological relations to\nother living things. If people conceptualise themselves and the world\nin relational terms, the deep ecologists argue, then people will take\nbetter care of nature and the world in general.\n\nAs developed by N\u00e6ss and others, the position also came to focus\non the possibility of the identification of the human ego\nwith nature. The idea is, briefly, that by identifying with nature I\ncan enlarge the boundaries of the self beyond my skin. My\nlarger\u2014ecological\u2014Self (the capital \u201cS\u201d\nemphasizes that I am something larger than my body and consciousness),\ndeserves respect as well. To respect and to care for my Self is also\nto respect and to care for the natural environment, which is actually\npart of me and with which I should identify. N\u00e6ss quotes the\nexample of Saami people and their identification with the rivers on\nwhich they depend for sustenance. Recognition of such identification\nhas underpinned the establishment in New Zealand of legal personhood\nfor some rivers and other natural areas (Kramm 2020).\n\u201cSelf-realization\u201d is thus the realization of a wider\necological Self. N\u00e6ss maintains that the deep satisfaction that\nwe receive from identification with nature and close partnership with\nother forms of life in nature contributes significantly to our life\nquality. (One historical antecedent to this kind of nature\nspiritualism is the romanticism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau as expressed\nin his last work, the Reveries of the Solitary Walker)\n\nWhen N\u00e6ss\u2019s view crossed the Atlantic, it was sometimes\nmerged with ideas emerging from Leopold\u2019s land ethic (see Devall\nand Sessions 1985; also see Sessions (ed) 1995). But\nN\u00e6ss\u2014wary of the supposed totalitarian political\nimplications of Leopold\u2019s position that individual interests and\nwell-being should be subordinated to the holistic good of the\nearth\u2019s biotic community (see section 4 below)\u2014took care\nto distance himself from advocating any sort of \u201cland\nethic\u201d. (See Anker 1999 for cautions on interpreting\nN\u00e6ss\u2019s relationalism as an endorsement of the kind of\nholism displayed in the land ethic; cf. Grey 1993, Taylor and\nZimmerman 2005). Some critics have argued that N\u00e6ss\u2019s deep\necology is no more than an extended social-democratic version of\nutilitarianism, which counts human interests in the same calculation\nalongside the interests of all natural things (e.g., trees, wolves,\nbears, rivers, forests and mountains) in the natural environment (see\nWitoszek 1997). However, N\u00e6ss failed to explain in any detail\nhow to make sense of the idea that oysters or barnacles, termites or\nbacteria could have interests of any morally relevant sort at all.\nWithout an account of this, N\u00e6ss\u2019s early \u201cbiospheric\negalitarianism\u201d\u2014that all living things whatsoever had a\nsimilar right to live and flourish\u2014was an indeterminate\nprinciple in practical terms. It also remains unclear in what sense\nrivers, mountains and forests can be regarded as possessors of any\nkind of interests. This is an issue on which N\u00e6ss always\nremained elusive.\n\nBiospheric egalitarianism was modified in the 1980s to the weaker\nclaim that the flourishing of both human and non-human life has value\nin itself, without any commitment to these values being equal. At the\nsame time, N\u00e6ss declared that his own favoured ecological\nphilosophy\u2014\u201cEcosophy T\u201d, as he called it after his\nTvergastein mountain cabin\u2014was only one of several possible\nfoundations for an environmental ethic. Deep ecology ceased to be a\nspecific doctrine, but instead became a \u201cplatform\u201d of\neight simple points on which N\u00e6ss hoped all deep green thinkers\ncould agree. The platform was conceived as establishing a middle\nground, between underlying orientations, whether indigenous,\nChristian, Buddhist, Daoist, process philosophy, or whatever, and the\npractical principles for action in specific situations, principles\ngenerated from the underlying philosophies. Thus the deep ecological\nmovement became explicitly pluralist both morally and\nepistemologically (see Brennan 1999; c.f. Light 1996, Akamani\n2020).\n\nWhile N\u00e6ss\u2019s Ecosophy T sees human Self-realization as a\nsolution to the environmental crises resulting from human selfishness\nand exploitation of nature, some of the followers of the deep ecology\nplatform in the United States and Australia further argue that the\nexpansion of the human self to include non-human nature is supported\nby the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, which is said to\nhave dissolved the boundaries between the observer and the observed\n(see Fox 1984, 1990, and Devall and Sessions 1985; cf. Callicott\n1985). These \u201crelationalist\u201d developments of deep ecology\nare, however, criticized by some feminist theorists. The idea of\nnature as part of oneself, they argue, could justify the continued\nexploitation of nature instead. For one is presumably more entitled to\ntreat oneself in whatever ways one likes than to treat another\nindependent agent in whatever ways one likes. According to these\nfeminist critics, the deep ecological theory of the \u201cexpanded\nself\u201d is in effect a disguised form of human colonialism, unable\nto give nature its due as a genuine \u201cother\u201d independent of\nhuman interest and purposes (see Plumwood 1993, Ch. 7, 1999, and\nWarren 1999).\n\nMeanwhile, other critics accuse deep ecology of being elitist in its\nattempts to preserve wilderness experiences for only a select group of\neconomically and socio-politically well-off people. Ramachandra Guha\n(1989, 1999) for instance, depicts the activities of many\nwestern-based conservation groups as a new form of cultural\nimperialism, aimed at securing converts to conservationism (cf.\nBookchin 1987 and Brennan 1998a). \u201cGreen missionaries\u201d, as\nGuha calls them, represent a movement aimed at further dispossessing\nthe world\u2019s poor and indigenous people. \u201cPutting deep\necology in its place,\u201d he writes, \u201cis to recognize that\nthe trends it derides as \u201cshallow\u201d ecology might in fact\nbe varieties of environmentalism that are more apposite, more\nrepresentative and more popular in the countries of the South.\u201d\nAlthough N\u00e6ss himself repudiates suggestions that deep ecology\nis committed to any form of imperialism (see Witoszek and Brennan\n(eds.) 1999, Ch. 36\u20137 and 41), Guha\u2019s criticism raises\nimportant questions about the application of deep ecological\nprinciples in different social, economic and cultural contexts.\nFinally, in other critiques, deep ecology is portrayed as having an\ninconsistent utopian vision (see Anker and Witoszek 1998).\n3.2 Feminism and the Environment\n\nBroadly speaking, a feminist issue is any that contributes in some way\nto understanding the oppression of women. Feminist theories attempt to\nanalyze women\u2019s oppression, its causes and consequences, and\nsuggest strategies and directions for women\u2019s liberation. By the\nmid 1970s, feminist writers had raised the issue of whether\npatriarchal modes of thinking encouraged not only widespread\ninferiorizing and colonizing of women, but also of people of colour,\nanimals and nature. Sheila Collins (1974), for instance, argued that\nmale-dominated culture or patriarchy is supported by four interlocking\npillars: sexism, racism, class exploitation, and ecological\ndestruction.\n\nEmphasizing the importance of feminism to the environmental movement\nand various other liberation movements, some writers, such as Ynestra\nKing (1989a and 1989b), argue that the domination of women by men is\nhistorically the original form of domination in human society, from\nwhich all other hierarchies\u2014of rank, class, and political\npower\u2014flow. For instance, human exploitation of nature may be\nseen as a manifestation and extension of the oppression of women, in\nthat it is the result of associating nature with the female, which had\nbeen already inferiorized and oppressed by the male-dominating\nculture. But within the plurality of feminist positions, other\nwriters, such as Val Plumwood (1993), understand the oppression of\nwomen as only one of the many parallel forms of oppression sharing and\nsupported by a common ideological structure, in which one party (the\ncolonizer, whether male, white or human) uses a number of conceptual\nand rhetorical devices to privilege its interests over that of the\nother party (the colonized: whether female, people of colour, or\nanimals). Facilitated by a common structure, seemingly diverse forms\nof oppression can mutually reinforce each other (Warren 1987, 1990,\n1994, Cheney 1989, and Plumwood 1993).\n\nNot all feminist theorists would call that common underlying\noppressive structure \u201candrocentric\u201d or\n\u201cpatriarchal\u201d. But it is generally agreed that core\nfeatures of the structure include dichotomies, hierarchical thinking,\nand a \u201clogic of domination\u201d, which are typical of, if not\nessential to, male-chauvinism. These patterns of thinking and\nconceptualizing the world, many feminist theorists argue, also nourish\nand sustain other forms of chauvinism including human-chauvinism\n(i.e., anthropocentrism), which is responsible for much human\nexploitation of, and destructiveness towards, nature. Writers comment\non dichotomous forms of thinking which depict the world in polar\nopposite terms, such as male/female, masculinity/femininity,\nreason/emotion, freedom/necessity, active/passive, mind/body,\npure/soiled, white/coloured, civilized/primitive,\ntranscendent/immanent, human/animal, culture/nature. When these\ndichotomies involve hierarchy and domination they are often labelled\n\"dualisms\". Under the influence of such dualisms all the first items\nin these contrasting pairs are assimilated with each other, and all\nthe second items are likewise linked with each other. For example, the\nmale is seen to be associated with the rational, active, creative,\nCartesian human mind, and civilized, orderly, transcendent culture;\nwhereas the female is regarded as tied to the emotional, passive,\ndetermined animal body, and primitive, disorderly, immanent nature.\nThese interlocking dualisms are not just descriptive dichotomies,\naccording to the feminists, but involve a prescriptive privileging of\none side of the opposed items over the other. Dualism confers\nsuperiority to everything on the male side, but inferiority to\neverything on the female side. The \u201clogic of domination\u201d\nthen dictates that those on the superior side (e.g., men, rational\nbeings, humans) are morally entitled to dominate and utilize those on\nthe inferior side (e.g., women, beings lacking in rationality,\nnon-humans) as mere means.\n\nThe problem with dualistic modes of thinking, however, is not just\nthat they are epistemically unreliable. It is not just that the\ndominating party often falsely sees the dominated party as lacking (or\npossessing) the allegedly superior (or inferior) qualities, or that\nthe dominated party often internalizes false stereotypes of itself\ngiven by its oppressors, or that stereotypical thinking often\noverlooks salient and important differences among individuals. More\nimportant, according to feminist analyses, the very premise of\nprescriptive dualism\u2014the valuing of attributes of one polarized\nside and the devaluing of those of the other, the idea that domination\nand oppression can be justified by appealing to attributes like\nmasculinity, rationality, being civilized or developed, etc.\u2014is\nitself problematic.\n\nFeminism represents a radical challenge for environmental thinking,\npolitics, and traditional social ethical perspectives. It promises to\nlink environmental questions with wider social problems concerning\nvarious kinds of discrimination and exploitation, and fundamental\ninvestigations of human psychology. However, whether there are\nconceptual, causal or merely contingent connections among the\ndifferent forms of oppression and liberation remains a contested issue\n(see Green 1994). The term \u201cecofeminism\u201d (first coined by\nFran\u00e7oise d\u2019Eaubonne in 1974) or \u201cecological\nfeminism\u201d was for a time generally applied to any view that\ncombines environmental advocacy with feminist analysis. However,\nbecause of the varieties of, and disagreements among, feminist\ntheories, the label may be too wide to be informative (see the entry\non\n feminist environmental philosophy).\n3.3 Disenchantment and the New Animism\n\nAn often overlooked source of ecological ideas is the work of the\nneo-Marxist Frankfurt School of critical theory founded by Max\nHorkheimer and Theodore Adorno (Horkheimer and Adorno 1969). While\nclassical Marxists regard nature as a resource to be transformed by\nhuman labour and utilized for human purposes, Horkheimer and Adorno\nsaw Marx himself as representative of the problem of \u201chuman\nalienation\u201d. At the root of this alienation, they argue, is a\nnarrow positivist conception of rationality\u2014which sees\nrationality as an instrument for pursuing progress, power and\ntechnological control, and takes observation, measurement and the\napplication of purely quantitative methods to be capable of solving\nall problems. Such a positivistic view of science combines determinism\nwith optimism. Natural processes as well as human activities are seen\nto be predictable and manipulable. Nature (and, likewise, human\nnature) is no longer mysterious, uncontrollable, or fearsome. Instead,\nit is reduced to an object strictly governed by natural laws, which\ntherefore can be studied, known, and employed to our benefit. By\npromising limitless knowledge and power, the positivism of science and\ntechnology not only removes our fear of nature, the critical theorists\nargue, but also destroys our sense of awe and wonder towards it. That\nis to say, positivism \u201cdisenchants\u201d nature\u2014along\nwith everything that can be studied by the sciences, whether natural,\nsocial or human.\n\nThe progress in knowledge and material well-being may not be a bad\nthing in itself, where the consumption and control of nature is a\nnecessary part of human life. However, the critical theorists argue\nthat the positivistic disenchantment of natural things (and, likewise,\nof human beings\u2014because they too can be studied and manipulated\nby science) disrupts our relationship with them, encouraging the\nundesirable attitude that they are nothing more than things to be\nprobed, consumed and dominated. According to the critical theorists,\nthe oppression of \u201couter nature\u201d (i.e., the natural\nenvironment) through science and technology is bought at a very high\nprice: the project of domination requires the suppression of our own\n\u201cinner nature\u201d (i.e., human nature)\u2014e.g., human\ncreativity, autonomy, and the manifold needs, vulnerabilities and\nlongings at the centre of human life. To remedy such an alienation,\nthe project of Horkheimer and Adorno is to replace the narrow\npositivistic and instrumentalist model of rationality with a more\nhumanistic one, in which the values of the aesthetic, moral, sensuous\nand expressive aspects of human life play a central part. Thus, their\naim is not to give up our rational faculties or powers of analysis and\nlogic. Rather, the ambition is to arrive at a dialectical synthesis\nbetween Romanticism and Enlightenment, to return to anti-deterministic\nvalues of freedom, spontaneity and creativity.\n\nIn his later work, Adorno advocates a re-enchanting aesthetic attitude\nof \u201csensuous immediacy\u201d towards nature. Not only do we\nstop seeing nature as primarily, or simply, an object of consumption,\nwe are also able to be directly and spontaneously acquainted with\nnature without interventions from our rational faculties. According to\nAdorno, works of art, like natural things, always involve an\n\u201cexcess\u201d, something more than their mere materiality and\nexchange value (see Vogel 1996, ch. 4.4 for a detailed discussion of\nAdorno\u2019s views on art, labour and domination). The\nre-enchantment of the world through aesthetic experience, he argues,\nis also at the same time a re-enchantment of human lives and purposes.\nAdorno\u2019s work remains largely unexplored in mainstream\nenvironmental philosophy, although the idea of applying critical\ntheory (embracing techniques of deconstruction, psychoanalysis and\nradical social criticism) to both environmental issues and the\nwritings of various ethical and political theorists has spawned the\nfield of \u201c\u00e9cocritique\u201d or\n\u201cecocriticism\u201d (Vogel 1996, Luke 1997, van Wyk 1997,\nDryzek 1997, Garrard 2014).\n\nSome students of Adorno\u2019s work have argued that his account of\nthe role of \u201csensuous immediacy\u201d can be understood as an\nattempt to defend a \u201clegitimate anthropomorphism\u201d that\ncomes close to a weak form of animism (Bernstein 2001, 196). Others,\nmore radical, have claimed to take inspiration from his notion of\n\u201cnon-identity\u201d, which, they argue, can be used as the\nbasis for a deconstruction of the notion of nature and perhaps even\nits elimination from ecocritical writing. For example, Timothy Morton\nargues that \u201cputting something called Nature on a pedestal and\nadmiring it from afar does for the environment what patriarchy does\nfor the figure of Woman. It is a paradoxical act of sadistic\nadmiration\u201d (Morton 2007, 5), and that \u201cin the name of all\nthat we value in the idea of \u2018nature\u2019, [ecocritique]\nthoroughly examines how nature is set up as a transcendental, unified,\nindependent category. Ecocritique does not think that it is\nparadoxical to say, in the name of ecology itself: \u2018down with\nnature!\u2019\u201d (ibid., 13). In this vein, some thinkers have\ninsisted that environmental ethics makes a mistake in drawing a\nsignificant distinction between the natural and the artificial (Vogel\n2015). Such an idea, however, has drawn fierce criticism from some\nMarxist theorists who argue that the \u201cend of nature\u201d\nthesis is deeply confused (for example Malm 2018). It remains to be\nseen, however, whether the radical attempt to purge the concept of\nnature from ecocritical work meets with success. Likewise, it is\nunclear whether the dialectic project on which Horkheimer and Adorno\nembarked is coherent, and whether Adorno, in particular, has a\nconsistent understanding of \u201cnature\u201d and\n\u201crationality\u201d (see Eckersley 1992 and Vogel 1996, for a\nreview of the Frankfurt School\u2019s thinking about nature, and on\nrationality see also the entry on\n critical theory).\n\nOn the other hand, the  new animists have been much inspired\nby the serious way in which some indigenous peoples placate and\ninteract with animals, plants and inanimate things through ritual,\nceremony and other practices (for examples see Kimmerer 2020).\nAccording to the new animists, the replacement of traditional animism\n(the view that personalized souls are found in animals, plants, and\nother material objects) by a form of disenchanting positivism directly\nleads to an anthropocentric perspective, which is accountable for much\nhuman destructiveness towards nature. In a disenchanted world, there\nis no meaningful order of things or events outside the human domain,\nand there is no source of sacredness or dread of the sort felt by\nthose who regard the natural world as peopled by divinities or demons\n(Stone 2006). When a forest is no longer sacred, there are no spirits\nto be placated and no mysterious risks associated with clear-felling\nit. A disenchanted nature is no longer alive. It commands no respect,\nreverence or love. It is nothing but a giant machine, to be mastered\nto serve human purposes. The new animists argue for reconceptualizing\nthe boundary between persons and non-persons. For them, \u201cliving\nnature\u201d comprises not only humans, animals and plants, but also\nmountains, forests, rivers, deserts, and even planets.\n\nWhether the notion that a mountain or a tree is to be regarded as a\nperson is taken literally or not, the attempt to engage with the\nsurrounding world as if it consists of other persons might possibly\nprovide the basis for a respectful attitude to nature (see Harvey 2005\nfor a popular account of the new animism). If disenchantment is a\nsource of environmental problems and destruction, then the new animism\ncan be regarded as attempting to re-enchant, and help to save, nature.\nMore poetically, David Abram has argued that a phenomenological\napproach of the kind taken by Merleau-Ponty can reveal to us that we\nare part of the \u201ccommon flesh\u201d of the world, that we are\nin a sense the world thinking itself (Abram 1995).\n\nIn her work, Freya Mathews has tried to articulate a version of\nanimism or panpsychism that captures ways in which the world (not just\nnature) contains many kinds of consciousness and sentience. For her,\nthere is an underlying unity of mind and matter in that the world is a\n\u201cself-realizing\u201d system containing a multiplicity of other\nsuch systems (cf. N\u00e6ss). According to Mathews, we are meshed in\ncommunication, and potential communication, with the \u201cOne\u201d\n(the greater cosmic self) and its many lesser selves (Mathews 2003,\n45\u201360). Materialism (the monistic theory that the world consists\npurely of matter), she argues, is self-defeating by encouraging a form\nof \u201ccollective solipsism\u201d that treats the world either as\nunknowable or as a social-construction (Mathews 2005, 12). Mathews\nalso takes inspiration from her interpretation of the core Daoist idea\nof  wuwei as \u201cletting be\u201d and bringing about\nchange through \u201ceffortless action\u201d. The focus in\nenvironmental management, development and commerce should be on\n\u201csynergy\u201d with what is already in place rather than on\ndemolition, replacement and disruption. Instead of bulldozing away old\nsuburbs and derelict factories, the synergistic panpsychist sees these\nartefacts as themselves part of the living cosmos, hence part of what\nis to be respected. Likewise, instead of trying to eliminate feral or\nexotic plants and animals, and restore environments to some imagined\npristine state, ways should be found\u2014wherever possible\u2014to\npromote synergies between the newcomers and the older native\npopulations in ways that maintain ecological flows and promote the\nfurther unfolding and developing of ecological processes (Mathews\n2004). Panpsychism, Mathews argues, frees us from the\n\u201cideological grid of capitalism\u201d, can reduce our desire\nfor consumer novelties, and can allow us and the world to grow old\ntogether with grace and dignity. Again, some of Mathews work echoes\nindigenous understandings of an enlarged subjectivity. As Deborah Rose\nputs it: \u201csubjectivity in the form of sentience and agency is\nnot solely a human prerogative but is located throughout other species\nand perhaps throughout country itself\u201d (Rose 2005, 302).\n\nIn summary, if disenchantment is a source of environmentally\ndestructive or uncaring attitudes, then both the aesthetic and the\nanimist/panpsychist re-enchantment of the world are intended to offer\nan antidote to such attitudes, and perhaps also inspirations for new\nforms of managing and designing for sustainability. The general\nproject of re-enchanting the world has surprising resonances with the\nviews of others who draw more explicitly on scientific understandings\nof life on earth. Earth systems science, for example, draws on the\nGaia hypothesis proposed by James Lovelock (Lovelock 1972,\n1979) suggesting that living things acting together regulate\nsignificant aspects of the global environment (Lovelock and Margulis\n1974). Later writers describe the Gaia hypothesis as conjecturing that\nsomething overlooked by previous scientific thinking was of vital\nimportance to understanding the one thing that supports all life on\nearth, namely a great stabilizing feedback system which regulates\nitself in a way that maintains the habitability of the planet (Lenton\net al. 2020). This feedback system is itself under threat\nfrom a changing climate, human overpopulation and reductions in\nbiodiversity (see further section 6 below and also Latour 2017). In\nplace of a vision of a grand cosmic self, champions of Gaia theory\nargue for recognizing the value of Life itself, where the capital \"L\"\ndraws attention to the great feedback system\u2014a single entity\ncomprising all the living things descended from the last universal\ncommon ancestor (Mariscal and Dolittle 2008).\n3.4 Social Ecology and Bioregionalism\n\nApart from feminist-environmentalist theories and N\u00e6ss\u2019s\ndeep ecology, Murray Bookchin\u2019s \u201csocial ecology\u201d has\nalso claimed to be radical, subversive, or countercultural (see\nBookchin 1980, 1987, 1990). Bookchin\u2019s version of critical\ntheory takes the \u201couter\u201d physical world as constituting\nwhat he calls \u201cfirst nature\u201d, from which culture or\n\u201csecond nature\u201d has evolved. Environmentalism, in his\nview, is a social movement, and the problems it confronts are social\nproblems. While Bookchin is prepared, like Horkheimer and Adorno, to\nregard (first) nature as an aesthetic and sensuous marvel, he regards\nour intervention in it as necessary. He suggests that we can choose to\nput ourselves at the service of natural evolution, to help maintain\ncomplexity and diversity, diminish suffering and reduce pollution.\nBookchin\u2019s social ecology recommends that we use our gifts of\nsociability, communication and intelligence as if we were\n\u201cnature rendered conscious\u201d, instead of turning them\nagainst the very source and origin from which such gifts derive.\nExploitation of nature should be replaced by a richer form of life\ndevoted to nature\u2019s preservation.\n\nJohn Clark has argued that social ecology is heir to a historical,\ncommunitarian tradition of thought that includes not only the\nanarchist Peter Kropotkin, but also the nineteenth century socialist\ngeographer Elis\u00e9e Reclus, the eccentric Scottish thinker\nPatrick Geddes and the latter\u2019s disciple, Lewis Mumford (Clark\n1998). Ramachandra Guha has described Mumford as \u201cthe pioneer\nAmerican social ecologist\u201d (Guha 1996, 210). Mumford adopted a\nregionalist perspective, arguing that strong regional centres of\nculture are the basis of \u201cactive and securely grounded local\nlife\u201d (Mumford 1944, 403). Like the pessimists in critical\ntheory, Mumford was worried about the emergence under industrialised\ncapitalism of a \u201cmegamachine\u201d, one that would oppress and\ndominate human creativity and freedom, and one that\u2014despite\nbeing a human product\u2014operates in a way that is out of our\ncontrol. While Bookchin is more of a technological optimist than\nMumford, both writers have inspired a regional turn in environmental\nthinking. Bioregionalism gives regionalism an environmental twist.\nThis is the view that natural features should provide the defining\nconditions for places of community, and that secure and satisfying\nlocal lives are led by those who know a place, have learned its lore\nand who adapt their lifestyle to its affordances by developing its\npotential within ecological limits. Such a life, the bioregionalists\nargue, will enable people to enjoy the fruits of self-liberation and\nself-development (see the essays in List 1993, and the book-length\ntreatment in Thayer 2003, for an introduction to bioregional\nthought).\n\nHowever, critics have asked why natural features should be significant\nin defining the places in which communities are to be built, and have\npuzzled over exactly which natural features these should\nbe\u2014geological, ecological, climatic, hydrological, and so on\n(see Brennan 1998b). If relatively small, bioregional communities are\nto be home to flourishing human societies, then a question also arises\nover the nature of the laws and punishments that will prevail in them,\nand also of their integration into larger regional and global legal,\npolitical and economic groupings. For anarchists and other critics of\nthe predominant social order, a return to self-governing and\nself-sufficient regional communities is often depicted as liberating\nand refreshing. But for the skeptics, the worry remains that the\nbioregional vision is politically over-optimistic and is open to the\nestablishment of illiberal, stifling and undemocratic communities.\nFurther, given its emphasis on local self-sufficiency and the virtue\nof life in small communities, a question arises over whether\nbioregionalism is workable in an overcrowded planet. Later bioregional\nproposals have identified ways of connecting with nature by showing\nstewardship for green infrastructure within cities (Andersson et al.\n2014).\n\nDeep ecology, feminism, and social ecology had a considerable impact\non the development of political positions in regard to the\nenvironment. Feminist analyses have often been welcomed for the\npsychological insight they bring to several social, moral and\npolitical problems. There is, however, considerable unease about the\nimplications of critical theory, social ecology and some varieties of\ndeep ecology and animism. Some writers have argued, for example, that\ncritical theory is bound to be ethically anthropocentric, with nature\nas no more than a \u201csocial construction\u201d whose value\nultimately depends on human determinations (see Vogel 1996). Others\nhave argued that the demands of \u201cdeep\u201d green theorists and\nactivists cannot be accommodated within contemporary theories of\nliberal politics and social justice (see Ferry 1998). A further\nsuggestion is that there is a need to reassess traditional theories\nsuch as virtue ethics, which has its origins in ancient Greek\nphilosophy (see the following section) within the context of a form of\nstewardship similar to that earlier endorsed by Passmore (see Barry\n1999). If this last claim is correct, then the radical activist need\nnot, after all, look for philosophical support in radical, or\ncountercultural, theories of the sort deep ecology, feminism,\nbioregionalism and social ecology claim to be (but see Zimmerman\n1994).\n4. Traditional Ethical Theories and Contemporary Environment Ethics\n\nAlthough environmental ethicists often try to distance themselves from\nthe anthropocentrism embedded in traditional ethical views (Passmore\n1974, Norton 1991 are exceptions), they also quite often draw their\ntheoretical resources from traditional ethical systems and theories.\nConsider the following two basic moral questions: (1) What kinds of\nthing are intrinsically valuable, good or bad? (2) What makes an\naction right or wrong?\n\nConsequentialist ethical theories consider intrinsic\n\u201cvalue\u201d / \u201cdisvalue\u201d or \u201cgoodness\u201d\n/ \u201cbadness\u201d to be more fundamental moral notions than\n\u201crightness\u201d / \u201cwrongness\u201d, and maintain that\nwhether an action is right/wrong is determined by whether its\nconsequences are good/bad. From this perspective, answers to question\n(2) are informed by answers to question (1). For instance,\nutilitarianism, a paradigm case of consequentialism, regards pleasure\n(or, more broadly construed, the satisfaction of interest, desire,\nand/or preference) as the only intrinsic value in the world, whereas\npain (or the frustration of desire, interest, and/or preference) is\nthe only intrinsic disvalue, and maintains that right actions are\nthose that would produce the greatest balance of pleasure over pain\n(see the entry on\n consequentialism).\n\nAs the utilitarian focus is the balance of pleasure and pain as such,\nthe question of to whom a pleasure or pain belongs is irrelevant to\nthe calculation and assessment of the rightness or wrongness of\nactions. Hence, the eighteenth century utilitarian Jeremy Bentham\n(1789), and later Peter Singer (1993), have argued that the interests\nof all the sentient beings (i.e., beings who are capable of\nexperiencing pleasure or pain)\u2014including non-human\nones\u2014affected by an action should be taken equally into\nconsideration in assessing the action. Furthermore, rather like\nRoutley (see section 2 above), Singer argues that the anthropocentric\nprivileging of members of the species Homo sapiens is arbitrary, and\nthat it is a kind of \u201cspeciesism\u201d as unjustifiable as\nsexism and racism. Singer regards the animal liberation movement as\ncomparable to the liberation movements of women and people of colour.\nUnlike the environmental philosophers who attribute intrinsic value to\nthe natural environment and its inhabitants, Singer and utilitarians\nin general attribute intrinsic value to the experience of pleasure or\ninterest satisfaction as such, not to the beings who have the\nexperience. Similarly, for the utilitarian, non-sentient objects in\nthe environment such as plant species, rivers, mountains, and\nlandscapes, all of which are the objects of moral concern for\nenvironmentalists, are of no intrinsic but at most instrumental value\nto the satisfaction of sentient beings (see Singer 1993, Ch. 10).\nFurthermore, because right actions, for the utilitarian, are those\nthat maximize the overall balance of interest satisfaction over\nfrustration, practices such as whale-hunting and the killing of an\nelephant for ivory, which cause suffering to non-human animals, might\nturn out to be right after all: such practices might produce\nconsiderable amounts of interest-satisfaction for human beings, which,\non the utilitarian calculation, outweigh the non-human\ninterest-frustration involved. As the result of all the above\nconsiderations, it is unclear to what extent a utilitarian ethic can\nalso be an environmental ethic. This point may not so readily apply to\na wider consequentialist approach, which attributes intrinsic value\nnot only to pleasure or satisfaction, but also to various objects and\nprocesses in the natural environment.\n\nDeontological ethical theories, in contrast, maintain that\nwhether an action is right or wrong is for the most part independent\nof whether its consequences are good or bad (see the entry on\n deontological ethics).\n From the deontologist perspective, there are several distinct moral\nrules or duties (e.g., \u201cnot to kill or otherwise harm the\ninnocent\u201d, \u201cnot to lie\u201d, \u201cto respect the\nrights of others\u201d, \u201cto keep promises\u201d), the\nobservance/violation of which is intrinsically right/wrong; i.e.,\nright/wrong in itself regardless of consequences. When asked to\njustify an alleged moral rule, duty or its corresponding right,\ndeontologists may appeal to the intrinsic value of those beings to\nwhom it applies. For instance, \u201canimal rights\u201d advocate\nTom Regan (1983) argues that those animals with intrinsic value (or\nwhat he calls \u201cinherent value\u201d) have the moral right to\nrespectful treatment, which then generates a general moral duty on our\npart not to treat them as mere means to other ends. We have, in\nparticular, a prima facie moral duty not to harm them. Regan maintains\nthat certain practices (such as sport or commercial hunting, and\nexperimentation on animals) violate the moral right of intrinsically\nvaluable animals to respectful treatment. Such practices, he argues,\nare intrinsically wrong regardless of whether or not some better\nconsequences ever flow from them. Exactly which animals have intrinsic\nvalue and therefore the moral right to respectful treatment?\nRegan\u2019s answer is: those that meet the criterion of being the\n\u201csubject-of-a-life\u201d. To be such a subject is a sufficient\n(though not necessary) condition for having intrinsic value, and to be\na subject-of-a-life involves, among other things, having\nsense-perceptions, beliefs, desires, motives, memory, a sense of the\nfuture, and a psychological identity over time.\n\nSome authors have extended concern for individual well-being further,\narguing for the intrinsic value of organisms achieving their own good,\nwhether those organisms are capable of consciousness or not. Paul\nTaylor\u2019s version of this view (1981 and 1986), which we might\ncall biocentrism, is a somewhat deontological example. He\nargues that each individual living thing in nature\u2014whether it is\nan animal, a plant, or a micro-organism\u2014is a\n\u201cteleological-center-of-life\u201d having a good or well-being\nof its own which can be enhanced or damaged, and that all individuals\nwho are teleological-centers-of life have equal intrinsic value (or\nwhat he calls \u201cinherent worth\u201d) which entitles them to\nmoral respect. Furthermore, Taylor maintains that the intrinsic value\nof wild living things generates a prima facie moral duty on our part\nto preserve or promote their goods as ends in themselves, and that any\npractices which treat those beings as mere means and thus display a\nlack of respect for them are intrinsically wrong. For a summary and\noverview of Taylor\u2019s biocentric ethic, see Brennan and Lo 2010,\n69\u201486. A biologically detailed defence of the idea that living\nthings have representations and goals and hence have moral worth is\nfound in Agar 2001. Unlike Taylor\u2019s egalitarian and\ndeontological biocentrism, Robin Attfield (1987) argues for a\nhierarchical view that while all beings having a good of their own\nhave intrinsic value, some of them (e.g., persons) have intrinsic\nvalue to a greater extent. Attfield also endorses a form of\nconsequentialism which takes into consideration, and attempts to\nbalance, the many and possibly conflicting goods of different living\nthings (see also Varner 1998 for a defense of biocentric individualism\nwith affinities to both consequentialist and deontological\napproaches). However, some critics have pointed out that the notion of\nbiological good or well-being is only descriptive not prescriptive\n(see Williams 1992 and O\u2019Neill 1993, Ch. 2). For instance, even\nif HIV has a good of its own this does not mean that we ought to\nassign any positive moral weight to the realization of that good.\n\nSubsequently the distinction between these two traditional approaches\nhas taken its own specific form of development in environmental\nphilosophy. Instead of pitting conceptions of value against\nconceptions of rights, it has been suggested that there may be two\ndifferent conceptions of intrinsic value in play in discussion about\nenvironmental good and evil. One the one side, there is the intrinsic\nvalue of states of affairs that are to be promoted\u2014and this is\nthe focus of the consequentialist thinkers. On the other\n(deontological) hand there is the intrinsic values of entities to be\nrespected (see Bradley 2006, McShane 2014). These two different foci\nfor the notion of intrinsic value still provide room for fundamental\nargument between deontologists and consequentialist to continue,\nalbeit in a somewhat modified form.\n\nNote that the ethics of animal liberation or animal rights and\nbiocentrism are both individualistic in that their various\nmoral concerns are directed towards individuals only\u2014not\necological wholes such as species, populations, biotic communities,\nand ecosystems. None of these is sentient, a subject-of-a-life, or a\nteleological-center-of-life, but the preservation of these collective\nentities is a major concern for many environmentalists. Moreover, the\ngoals of animal liberationists, such as the reduction of animal\nsuffering and death, may conflict with the goals of environmentalists.\nFor example, the preservation of the integrity of an ecosystem may\nrequire the culling of feral animals or of some indigenous animal\npopulations that threaten to destroy fragile habitats. So there are\ndisputes about whether the ethics of animal liberation is a proper\nbranch of environmental ethics (see Callicott 1980, 1988, Sagoff 1984,\nJamieson 1998, Crisp 1998 and Varner 2000).\n\nCriticizing the individualistic approach in general for failing to\naccommodate conservation concerns for ecological wholes, J. Baird\nCallicott (1980) once advocated a version of land-ethical\nholism which takes Leopold\u2019s statement \u201cA thing\nis right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and\nbeauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends\notherwise\u201d to be the supreme deontological principle. In this\ntheory, the earth\u2019s biotic community per se is the sole\nlocus of intrinsic value, whereas the value of its individual members\nis merely instrumental and dependent on their contribution to the\n\u201cintegrity, stability, and beauty\u201d of the larger\ncommunity. A straightforward implication of this version of the land\nethic is that an individual member of the biotic community ought to be\nsacrificed whenever that is needed for the protection of the holistic\ngood of the community. For instance, Callicott maintains that if\nculling a white-tailed deer is necessary for the protection of the\nholistic biotic good, then it is a land-ethical requirement to do so.\nBut, to be consistent, the same point also applies to human\nindividuals because they are also members of the biotic community. Not\nsurprisingly, the misanthropy implied by Callicott\u2019s\nland-ethical holism was widely criticized and regarded as a\nreductio of the position (see Aiken (1984), Kheel (1985),\nFerr\u00e9 (1996), and Shrader-Frechette (1996)). Tom Regan (1983,\np.362), in particular, condemned the holistic land ethic\u2019s\ndisregard of the rights of the individual as \u201cenvironmental\nfascism\u201d. Since then commentators have noted the links between\nfascism and conservation thinking (Biehl and Staudenmaier 2011). The\nsubsequent emergence of explicitly ecofascist on-line movements and\nterrorist acts that claim to be ecologically-inspired (Lawton 2019)\nlead one writer to declare that there is a danger the world will enter\nan age of \u201cclimate barbarism\u201d(Klein 2019).\n\nUnder pressure from the charge of ecofascism and misanthropy,\nCallicott (1989 Ch. 5, and 1999, Ch. 4) later revises his\nneo-Leopodian position to maintain that the biotic community (indeed,\nany community to which humans belong) as well as its individual\nmembers (indeed, any individual who shares with us membership in some\ncommon community) all have intrinsic value. To further distance\nhimself from the charge of ecofascism, Callicott introduced explicit\nprinciples which prioritize obligations to human communities over\nthose to natural ones. He called these \u201csecond-order\u201d\nprinciples for specifying the conditions under which the land\nethic\u2019s holistic and individualistic obligations were to be\nranked. As he put it:\n\n... obligations generated by membership in more venerable and\nintimate communities take precedence over these generated in more\nrecently-emerged and impersonal communities... The second second-order\nprinciple is that stronger interests (for lack of a better\nword) generate duties that take precedence over duties generated by\nweaker interests. (Callicott 1999, 76)\n\n\nLo 2001 provides an overview and critique of Callicott\u2019s\nchanging position over two decades, while Ouderkirk and Hill (eds.)\n2002 gives an overview of debates between Callicott and others\nconcerning the metaethical and metaphysical foundations for the land\nethic and also its historical antecedents. As Lo points out, the final\nmodified version of the land ethic needs more than two second-order\nprinciples, since a third-order principle is needed to specify\nCallicott\u2019s implicit view that the second second-order principle\ngenerally countermands the first one when they come into conflict (Lo\n2001, 345). In later work, Callicott follows Lo\u2019s suggestion,\nwhile cautioning against aiming for too much precision in specifying\nthe demands of the land ethic (Callicott 2013, 66\u20137). While\nCallicott\u2019s reading of Leopold is widely regarded as authoritative,\nlater writers have queried whether Leopold might be better interpreted\na a moral pluralist (Dixon 2017) and have also raised doubts about the\nform of Darwinism that Leopold is supposed to have espoused (Millstein\n2015). For further critique of Callicott on Leopold, see also Newman,\nVarner and Linquist 2017, ch.10. \n\nThe controversy surrounding Callicott\u2019s original position,\nhowever, has inspired efforts in environmental ethics to investigate\npossibilities of attributing intrinsic value to ecological wholes, not\njust their individual constituent parts. Following in\nCallicott\u2019s footsteps, and inspired by N\u00e6ss\u2019s\nrelational account of value, Warwick Fox has championed a theory of\n\u201cresponsive cohesion\u201d which aims to give supreme moral\npriority to the maintenance of ecosystems and the biophysical world\n(Fox 2007). It remains to be seen if this position escapes the charges\nof misanthropy and totalitarianism laid against earlier holistic and\nrelational theories of value.\n\nIndividual natural entities (whether sentient or not, living or not),\nAndrew Brennan (1984, 2014) argues, are not designed by anyone to\nfulfill any purpose and therefore lack \u201cintrinsic\nfunction\u201d (i.e., the function of a thing that constitutes part\nof its essence or identity conditions). This, he proposes, is a reason\nfor thinking that individual natural entities should not be treated as\nmere instruments, and thus a reason for assigning them intrinsic\nvalue. Furthermore, he argues that the same moral point applies to the\ncase of natural ecosystems, to the extent that they lack intrinsic\nfunction. In the light of Brennan\u2019s proposal, Eric Katz (1991\nand 1997) argues that all natural entities, whether individuals or\nwholes, have intrinsic value in virtue of their ontological\nindependence from human purpose, activity, and interest, and maintains\nthe deontological principle that nature as a whole is an\n\u201cautonomous subject\u201d which deserves moral respect and must\nnot be treated as a mere means to human ends. Carrying the project of\nattributing intrinsic value to nature to its ultimate form, Robert\nElliot (1997) argues that naturalness itself is a property in virtue\nof possessing which all natural things, events, and states of affairs,\nattain intrinsic value. Furthermore, Elliot argues that even a\nconsequentialist, who in principle allows the possibility of trading\noff intrinsic value from naturalness for intrinsic value from other\nsources, could no longer justify such kind of trade-off in reality.\nThis is because the reduction of intrinsic value due to the depletion\nof naturalness on earth, according to him, has reached such a level\nthat any further reduction of it could not be compensated by any\namount of intrinsic value generated in other ways, no matter how great\nit is.\n\nAs the notion of \u201cnatural\u201d is understood in terms of the\nlack of human contrivance and is often opposed to the notion of\n\u201cartifactual\u201d, one much contested issue concerns the value\nof those parts of nature that have been touched by human\nartifice\u2014for instance, previously degraded natural environments\nwhich have been humanly restored. Based on the premise that the\nproperties of being naturally evolved and having a natural continuity\nwith the remote past are \u201cvalue adding\u201d (i.e., adding\nintrinsic value to those things which possess those two properties),\nElliot argues that even a perfectly restored environment would\nnecessarily lack those two value-adding properties and therefore be\nless valuable than the originally undegraded natural environment.\nKatz, on the other hand, argues that a restored nature is really just\nan artifact designed and created for the satisfaction of human ends,\nand that the value of restored environments is instrumental. He\nfurther argues that restoration is a form of the \u201cdomination of\nreality\u201d and controversially compares such domination to Nazi\npolicies of xenophobia, nativism and eliminationsm (Katz 2021).\nCritics have pointed out that advocates of a moral dichotomy between\nthe natural and the artifactual run the risk of diminishing the value\nof human life and culture, and fail to recognize that the natural\nenvironments interfered with by humans may still have morally\nimportant qualities other than pure naturalness (see Lo 1999, and\nKatz\u2019s response in Katz 2012).\n\nTwo other issues central to this debate are that the key concept\n\u201cnatural\u201d seems ambiguous in many different ways (see Hume\n1751, App. 3; Mill 1874; Brennan [1988] 2014; Ch. 6; Elliot 1997, Ch.\n4), and that those who argue that human interference reduces the\nintrinsic value of nature seem to have simply assumed the crucial\npremise that naturalness is a source of intrinsic value. Some thinkers\nmaintain that the natural, or the \u201cwild\u201d construed as that\nwhich \u201cis not humanized\u201d (Hettinger and Throop 1999, p.\n12) or to some degree \u201cnot under human control\u201d (ibid., p.\n13) is intrinsically valuable. Yet, as Bernard Williams points out\n(Williams 1992), we may, paradoxically, need to use our technological\npowers to retain a sense of something not being in our power. The\nretention of wild areas may thus involve planetary and ecological\nmanagement to maintain, or even \u201cimprison\u201d such areas\n(Birch 1990), raising a question over the extent to which national\nparks and wilderness areas are free from our control. An anlogy with\ngardening has sometimes been used to explore the nature of restoration\n(Allison 2004).\n\nGiven the significance of the concept of naturalness in these debates,\nit is perhaps surprising that there has been relatively little\nanalysis of that concept itself in environmental thought. In his\npioneering work on the ethics of the environment, Holmes Rolston has\nworked with a number of different conceptions of the natural (see\nBrennan and Lo 2010, pp.116\u201323, for an analysis of three senses\nof the term \u201cnatural\u201d that may be found in Rolston\u2019s\nwork). An explicit attempt to provide a conceptual analysis of a\ndifferent sort is found in Siipi 2008, while an account of naturalness\nlinking this to historical narratives of place is given in\nO\u2019Neill, Holland and Light 2008, ch. 8 (compare the response to\nthis in Siipi 2011). For reflections on how to protect \u201cone\nnature with several representations\u201d from the perspective of\nscience policy see Ducarme and Couvet 2020.\n\nFinally, as an alternative to consequentialism and deontology both of\nwhich consider \u201cthin\u201d concepts such as\n\u201cgoodness\u201d and \u201crightness\u201d as essential to\nmorality, virtue ethics proposes to understand\nmorality\u2014and assess the ethical quality of actions\u2014in\nterms of \u201cthick\u201d concepts such as \u201ckindness\u201d,\n\u201chonesty\u201d, \u201csincerity\u201d and\n\u201cjustice\u201d. These, and other excellent traits of character\nare virtues (see the entry on\n virtue ethics).\n As virtue ethics speaks quite a different language from the other two\nkinds of ethical theory, its theoretical focus is not so much on what\nkinds of things are good/bad, or what makes an action right/wrong.\nIndeed, the richness of the language of virtues, and the emphasis on\nmoral character, is sometimes cited as a reason for exploring a\nvirtues-based approach to the complex and always-changing questions of\nsustainability and environmental care (Hill 1983, Wensveen 2000,\nSandler 2007). One question central to virtue ethics is what the moral\nreasons are for acting one way or another. For instance, from the\nperspective of virtue ethics, kindness and loyalty would be moral\nreasons for helping a friend in hardship. These are quite different\nfrom the deontologist\u2019s reason (that the action is demanded by a\nmoral rule) or the consequentialist reason (that the action will lead\nto a better over-all balance of good over evil in the world). From the\nperspective of virtue ethics, the motivation and justification of\nactions are both inseparable from the character traits of the acting\nagent. Furthermore, unlike deontology or consequentialism the moral\nfocus of which is other people or states of the world, one central\nissue for virtue ethics is how to live a flourishing human life, this\nbeing a central concern of the moral agent himself or herself.\n\u201cLiving virtuously\u201d is Aristotle\u2019s recipe for\nflourishing. Versions of virtue ethics advocating virtues such as\n\u201cbenevolence\u201d, \u201cpiety\u201d,\n\u201cfiliality\u201d, and \u201ccourage\u201d, have also been\nheld by thinkers in the Chinese Confucian tradition. The connection\nbetween morality and psychology is another core subject of\ninvestigation for virtue ethics. It is sometimes suggested that human\nvirtues, which constitute an important aspect of a flourishing human\nlife, must be compatible with human needs and desires, and perhaps\nalso sensitive to individual affection and temperaments. As its\ncentral focus is human flourishing as such, virtue ethics may seem\nunavoidably anthropocentric and unable to support a genuine moral\nconcern for the non-human environment. But just as Aristotle has\nargued that a flourishing human life requires friendships and one can\nhave genuine friendships only if one genuinely values, loves,\nrespects, and cares for one\u2019s friends for their own sake, not\nmerely for the benefits that they may bring to oneself, some have\nargued that a flourishing human life requires the moral capacities to\nvalue, love, respect, and care for the non-human natural world as an\nend in itself (see O\u2019Neill 1992, O\u2019Neill 1993, Barry\n1999). Not only Aristotle, but also Kant can be used in support of\nsuch a position. Toby Svoboda argues, for example, that even indirect\nduties to protect nature can be the basis of good moral reasons to\npromote the flourishing of natural things, regardless of whether doing\nso promotes human interests (Svoboda 2019). Other virtue ethicists\nclaim to be able to provie an account of what it is to feel guilt\nabout damage people have done to the environment and to make sense of\nthe idea of a genuine feeling of gratitude toward nature \u201cfor\nbeing what it is\u201d (Wood 2019).\n\nSupplementary Document:\n\nBiodiversity Preservation\n\n5. Wilderness, the Built Environment, Poverty and Politics\n\nDespite the variety of positions in environmental ethics developed\nover the last thirty years, they have often focused on issues\nconcerned with wilderness and the reasons for its preservation (see\nCallicott and Nelson 1998 for a collection of essays on the ideas and\nmoral significance of wilderness). The importance of wilderness\nexperience to the human psyche has been emphasized by many\nenvironmental philosophers. N\u00e6ss, for instance, urges us to\nensure we spend time dwelling in situations of intrinsic value,\nwhereas Rolston seeks \u201cre-creation\u201d of the human soul by\nmeditating in the wilderness. Likewise, the critical theorists believe\nthat aesthetic appreciation of nature has the power to re-enchant\nhuman life. As wilderness becomes increasingly rare, people\u2019s\nexposure to wild things in their natural state has become reduced, and\naccording to some authors this may reduce the chance of our lives and\nother values being transformed as a result of interactions with\nnature. An argument by Bryan Norton draws attention to an analogy with\nmusic. Someone exposed for the first time to a new musical genre may\nundergo a transformation in musical preferences, tastes and values as\na result of the experience (Norton 1987. Such a transformation can\naffect their other preferences and desires too, in both direct and\nindirect ways (see Sarkar 2005, ch. 4, esp. pp. 82\u20137). In the\nattempt to preserve opportunities for experiences that can change or\nenhance people\u2019s valuations of nature, there has been a move\nsince the early 2000s to find ways of rewilding degraded environments,\nand even parts of cities (Fraser 2009, Monbiot 2013). Note that such\nrewilding is distinct from more traditional forms of restoration,\nsince it need not be pursued with the intention of re-creating some\noriginal landscape or biological system (duToit and Pettorelli 2019).\nA spectacular form of rewilding may be associated with efforts to\nresurrect some long-dead species by using genetic technology to\ncombine the DNA of an extinct species with the DNA of some\nclosely-related contemporary species. For a review of some of the\nissues about de-extinction see Minteer 2015, and also Siipi and\nFinkelman 2017. Cautions about thinking of de-extinction as radically\ndifferent from more conventional conservation and restoration\npractices are expressed in Novak 2018.\n\nBy contrast to the focus on wild places, relatively little attention\nhas been paid to the built environment, although this is the one in\nwhich most people spend most of their time. In post-war Britain, for\nexample, cheaply constructed new housing developments were often poor\nreplacements for traditional communities. They have been associated\nwith lower amounts of social interaction and increased crime compared\nwith the earlier situation. The destruction of highly functional\nhigh-density traditional housing, indeed, might be compared with the\ndestruction of highly diverse ecosystems and biotic communities.\nLikewise, the loss of the world\u2019s huge diversity of natural\nlanguages has been mourned by many, not just professionals with an\ninterest in linguistics. Urban and linguistic environments are just\ntwo of the many \u201cplaces\u201d inhabited by humans. Some\nphilosophical theories about natural environments and objects have\npotential to be extended to cover built environments and non-natural\nobjects of several sorts (see King 2000, Light 2001, Palmer 2003,\nwhile Fox 2007 aims to include both built and natural environments in\nthe scope of a single ethical theory). Certainly there are many\nparallels between natural and artificial domains: for example, many of\nthe conceptual problems involved in discussing the restoration of\nnatural objects such as landscapes and ecosystems also appear in the\nparallel context of restoring human-made objects such as buildings and\nworks of art (Vogel 2015).\n\nLovers of wilderness sometimes consider the high human populations in\nsome developing countries as a key problem underlying the\nenvironmental crisis. Rolston (1996), for instance, claims that (some)\nhumans are a kind of planetary \u201ccancer\u201d. He maintains that\nwhile \u201cfeeding people always seems humane, ... when we face up\nto what is really going on, by just feeding people, without attention\nto the larger social results, we could be feeding a kind of\ncancer.\u201d This remark is meant to justify the view that saving\nnature should, in some circumstances, have a higher priority than\nfeeding people. But such a view has been criticized for seeming to\nreveal a degree of misanthropy, directed at those human beings least\nable to protect and defend themselves (see Attfield 1998, Brennan\n1998a). The empirical basis of Rolston\u2019s claims has been queried\nby work showing that poor people are often extremely good\nenvironmental managers (Martinez-Alier 2002). Guha\u2019s worries\nabout the elitist and \u201cmissionary\u201d tendencies of some\nkinds of deep green environmentalism in certain rich western countries\ncan be quite readily extended to theorists such as Rolston (Guha\n1999). Can such an apparently elitist sort of wilderness ethics ever\nbe democratised? How can the psychically-reviving power of the wild\nbecome available to those living in the slums of Kolkata or S\u00e3o\nPaolo? These questions so far lack convincing answers.\n\nConnections between environmental destruction, unequal resource\nconsumption, poverty and the global economic order have been discussed\nby political scientists, development theorists, geographers and\neconomists as well as by philosophers. Links between economics and\nenvironmental ethics are particularly well established. Work by Mark\nSagoff (1988), for instance, has played a major part in bringing the\ntwo fields together. He argues that \u201cas citizens rather than\nconsumers\u201d people are concerned about values, which cannot\nplausibly be reduced to mere ordered preferences or quantified in\nmonetary terms. Sagoff\u2019s distinction between people as consumers\nand people as citizens was intended to blunt the use of cost-benefit\nanalysis as the final arbiter in discussions about nature\u2019s\nvalue. Of course, spouses take out insurance on each others\u2019\nlives. We pay extra for travel insurance to cover the cost of\ncancellation, illness, or lost baggage. Such actions are economically\nrational. They provide us with some compensation in case of loss.\nNo-one, however, would regard insurance payments as replacing lost\nlimbs, a loved one or even the joys of a cancelled vacation. So it is\nfor nature, according to Sagoff. We can put dollar values on a stand\nof timber, a reef, a beach, a national park. We can measure the travel\ncosts, the money spent by visitors, the real estate values, the park\nfees and all the rest. But these dollar measures do not tell us the\nvalue of nature any more than my insurance premiums tell you the value\nof a human life (also see Shrader-Frechette 1987, O\u2019Neill 1993,\nand Brennan 1995). If Sagoff is right, cost-benefit analysis cannot be\na basis for an ethic of sustainability any more than for an ethic of\nbiodiversity. The potentially misleading appeal to economic reason\nused to justify the expansion of the corporate sector has also come\nunder critical scrutiny by globalisation theorists (see Korten 1999).\nThese critiques do not aim to eliminate economics from environmental\nthinking; rather, they resist any reductive, and strongly\nanthropocentric, tendency to believe that all social and environmental\nproblems are fundamentally or essentially economic. The development of\necological economics explores the scope for common ground between\neconomists and environmental policy-makers, and also the role of\nenvironmental ethics in such discussions (Washington and Maloney\n2020).\n\nOther interdisciplinary approaches link environmental ethics with\nbiology, policy studies, public administration, political theory,\ncultural history, post-colonial theory, literature, geography, and\nhuman ecology (for some examples, see Norton, Hutchins, Stevens, Maple\n1995, Shrader-Frechette 1984, Gruen and Jamieson (eds.) 1994, Karliner\n1997, Diesendorf and Hamilton 1997, Schmidtz and Willott 2002). Many\nassessments of issues concerned with biodiversity, ecosystem health,\npoverty, environmental justice and sustainability look at both human\nand environmental issues, eschewing in the process commitment either\nto a purely anthropocentric or purely ecocentric perspective (see\nHayward and O\u2019Neill 1997, and Dobson 1999 for collections of\nessays looking at the links between sustainability, justice, welfare\nand the distribution of environmental goods). The future development\nof environmental ethics depends on these, and other interdisciplinary\nsynergies, as much as on its anchorage within philosophy (Dereniowska\nand Matzke 2014).\n6. Sustainability and Climate Change \n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity discussed in the supplementary\ndocument on\n Biodiversity Preservation\n was influenced by\n Our Common Future,\n an earlier United Nations document on sustainability produced by the\nWorld Commission on Environment and Development (WCED 1987). The\ncommission was chaired by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of\nNorway at the time, and the report is sometimes known as the\nBrundtland Report. This report noted the increasing tide of evidence\nthat planetary systems vital to supporting life on earth were under\nstrain. The key question it raised is whether it is equitable to\nsacrifice options for future well-being in favour of supporting\ncurrent lifestyles, especially the comfortable, and sometimes lavish,\nforms of life enjoyed in the rich countries. As Bryan Norton puts it,\nthe world faces a global challenge to see whether different human\ngroups, with widely varying perspectives, can perhaps \u201caccept\nresponsibility to maintain a non-declining set of opportunities based\non possible uses of the environment\u201d. The preservation of\noptions for the future can be readily linked to notions of equity if\nit is agreed that \u201cthe future ought not to face, as a result of\nour actions today, a seriously reduced range of options and choices,\nas they try to adapt to the environment that they face\u201d (Norton\n2001: 419). Note that references to \u201cthe future\u201d need not\nbe limited to the future of human beings only. In keeping with the\nnon-anthropocentric focus of much environmental philosophy, a care for\nsustainability and biodiversity can embrace a care for opportunities\navailable to non-human living things.\n\nHowever, when the concept \u201csustainable development\u201d was\nfirst articulated in the Brundtland Report, the emphasis was clearly\nanthropocentric. In face of increasing evidence that planetary systems\nvital to life-support were under strain, the concept of sustainable\ndevelopment is constructed in the report to encourage certain globally\ncoordinated directions and types of economic and social development.\nThe report defines \u201csustainable development\u201d in the\nfollowing way:\n\n\nSustainable development is development that meets the needs of the\npresent without compromising the ability of future generations to meet\ntheir own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:\n\nthe concept of \u201cneeds\u201d, in particular the essential\nneeds of the world\u2019s poor, to which overriding priority should\nbe given; and\nthe idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and\nsocial organization on the environment\u2019s ability to meet present\nand future needs.\n\n\nThus the goals of economic and social development must be defined in\nterms of sustainability in all countries\u2014developed or\ndeveloping, market-oriented or centrally planned. Interpretations will\nvary, but must share certain general features and must flow from a\nconsensus on the basic concept of sustainable development and on a\nbroad strategic framework for achieving it. (WCED 1987, Ch. 2,\nparagraphs 1\u20132)\n\n\nThe report goes on to argue that \u201cthe industrial world has\nalready used much of the planet\u2019s ecological capital. This\ninequality is the planet\u2019s main \u2018environmental\u2019\nproblem; it is also its main \u2018development\u2019 problem\u201d\n(WCED 1987, Overview, paragraph 17). In the concept of sustainable\ndevelopment the report combines the resource economist\u2019s notion\nof \u201csustainable yield\u201d with the recognition that\ndeveloping countries of the world are entitled to economic growth and\nprosperity. The notion of sustainable yield involves thinking of\nforests, rivers, oceans and other ecosystems, including the natural\nspecies living in them, as a stock of \u201cecological capital\u201d\nfrom which all kinds of goods and services flow. Provided the flow of\nsuch goods and services does not reduce the capacity of the capital\nitself to maintain its productivity, the use of the systems in\nquestion is regarded as sustainable. Thus, the report argues that\n\u201cmaximum sustainable yield must be defined after taking into\naccount system-wide effects of exploitation\u201d of ecological\ncapital (WCED 1987, Ch. 2, paragraph 11).\n\nThere are clear philosophical, political and economic precursors to\nthe Brundtland concept of sustainability. For example, John Stuart\nMill (1848, IV. 6. 1) distinguished between the \u201cstationary\nstate\u201d and the \u201cprogressive state\u201d and argued that\nat the end of the progressive state lies the stationary state, since\n\u201cthe increase of wealth is not boundless\u201d. Mill also\nrecognized a debt to the gloomy prognostications of Thomas Malthus,\nwho had conjectured that population tends to increase geometrically\nwhile food resources at best increase only arithmetically, so that\ndemand for food will ultimately outstrip the supply (see Milgate and\nStimson 2009, Ch. 7, and the discussion of Malthus in the Political\nEconomy section of the Spring 2016 version of the entry on\n Mill).\n Reflection on Malthus led Mill to argue for restraining human\npopulation growth:\n\nEven in a progressive state of capital, in old countries, a\nconscientious or prudential restraint on population is indispensable,\nto prevent the increase of numbers from outstripping the increase of\ncapital, and the condition of the classes who are at the bottom of\nsociety from being deteriorated (Mill 1848, IV. 6. 1).\n\n\nSuch warnings resonate with pessimism about increasing human\npopulation and its impact on the poorest people, as well as on loss of\nbiodiversity, fresh water scarcity, overconsumption and climate\nchange. In their controversial work The Population Bomb, Paul\nand Anne Ehrlich, argue that without restrictions on population\ngrowth, including the imposition of mandatory birth control, the world\nfaced \u201cmass starvation\u201d in the short term (Ehrlich 1968).\nThis prediction was not fulfilled. In a subsequent defence of their\nearly work, the Ehrlichs declared that the most serious flaw in their\noriginal analysis \u201cwas that it was much too optimistic about the\nfuture\u201d, and comment that \u201cSince The Bomb was written,\nincreases in greenhouse gas flows into the atmosphere, a consequence\nof the near doubling of the human population and the near tripling of\nglobal consumption, indicate that the results will likely be\ncatastrophic climate disruption caused by greenhouse heating\u201d\n(Ehrlich and Ehrlich 2009, 66). It was also in 1968 that Garrett\nHardin published his much cited article on the \u201ctragedy of the\ncommons\u201d arguing that common resources can always be subject to\ndegradation and extinction in the face of the rational pursuit of\nself-interest. For Hardin, the increasing pressure on shared\nresources, and increasing pollution, are inevitable results of the\nfact that \u201cthere is no technical solution to the population\nproblem\u201d (Hardin 1968). The problem may be analysed from the\nperspective of the so-called\n prisoner\u2019s dilemma\n (also see the entry on the\n free rider problem).\n Despite the pessimism of writers at the time, and the advocacy of\nsetting limits to population growth, there was also an optimism that\nechoes Mill\u2019s own view that a \u201cstationary state\u201d\nwould not be one of misery and decline, but rather one in which humans\ncould aspire to more equitable distribution of available and limited\nresources. This is clear not only among those who recognize limits to\neconomic growth (Meadows et al. 1972) but also among those who\nchampion the move to a steady state economy (Daly 1991) or at least\nwant to see more account taken of ecology in economics (Norgaard 1994,\nRees 2020).\n\nThe Brundtland report puts less emphasis on limits than do Mill,\nMalthus and later writers. It depicts sustainability as a challenge\nand opportunity for the world to become more socially, politically and\nenvironmentally fair. In pursuit of\n intergenerational justice,\n it suggests that there should be new human rights added to the\nstandard list, for example, that \u201cAll human beings have the\nfundamental right to an environment adequate for their health and well\nbeing\u201d (WCED 1987, Annexe 1, paragraph 1). The report also\nargues that \u201cThe enjoyment of any right requires respect for the\nsimilar rights of others, and recognition of reciprocal and even joint\nresponsibilities. States have a responsibility towards their own\ncitizens and other states\u201d (ibid., chapter 12, paragraph 83).\nSince the report\u2019s publication, many writers have supported and\ndefended the view that global and\n economics [normative] and economic justice\n require that nations which had become wealthy through earlier\nindustrialization and environmental exploitation should allow less\ndeveloped nations similar or equivalent opportunities for development\nespecially in term of access to environmental resources (Redclift\n2005). As intended by the report the idea of sustainable development\nhas become strongly integrated into the notion of environmental\nconservation. The report has also set the scene for a range of\nsubsequent international conferences, declarations, and protocols many\nof them maintaining the emphasis on the prospects for the future of\nhumanity, rather than considering sustainability in any wider\nsense.\n\nSome non-anthropocentric environmental thinkers have found the\nlanguage of economics used in the report unsatisfactory in its\nimplications since it already appears to assume a largely instrumental\nview of nature. The use of notions such as \u201casset\u201d,\n\u201ccapital\u201d and also the word \u201cresources\u201d in\nconnection with natural objects and systems has been identified by\nsome writers as instrumentalizing natural things which are in essence\nwild and free. The objection is that such language promotes the\ntendency to think of natural things as mere resources for humans or as\nraw materials with which human labour could be mixed, not only to\nproduce consumable goods, but also to generate human ownership\n(Plumwood 1993, Sagoff 2004). If natural objects and systems have\nintrinsic value independent of their possible use for humans, as many\nenvironmental philosophers have argued, then a policy approach to\nsustainability needs to consider the environment and natural things\nnot only in instrumental and but also in intrinsic terms to do justice\nto the moral standing that many people believe such items possess.\nDespite its acknowledgment of there being \u201cmoral, ethical,\ncultural, aesthetic, and purely scientific reasons for conserving wild\nbeings\u201d (WCED 1987, Overview, paragraph 53), the strongly\nanthropocentric and instrumental language used throughout the\nBrundtland report in articulating the notion of sustainable\ndevelopment can be criticised for defining the notion too narrowly,\nleaving little room for addressing sustainability questions directly\nconcerning the Earth\u2019s environment and its non-human\ninhabitants: should, and if so, how should, human beings reorganise\ntheir ways of life and the social-political structures of their\ncommunities to allow sustainability and equity not only for all humans\nbut also for the other species on the planet?\n\nThe concern for preserving nature and non-human species is addressed\nto some extent by making a distinction between weaker and stronger\nconceptions of sustainability (Beckerman 1995). Proponents of weak\nsustainability argue that it is acceptable to replace natural capital\nwith human-made capital provided that the latter has equivalent\nfunctions. If, for example, plastic trees could produce oxygen, absorb\ncarbon and support animal and insect communities, then they could\nreplace the real thing, and a world with functionally equivalent\nartificial trees would seem just as good\u2014from an economic\nperpective\u2014as one with real or natural trees in it. For weak\nsustainability theorists, the aim of future development should be to\nmaintain a consistently productive stock of capital on which to draw,\nwhile not insisting that some portion of that capital be natural.\nStrong sustainability theorists, by contrast, generally resist the\nsubstitution of human for natural capital, insisting that a critical\nstock of natural things and processes be preserved. By so doing, they\nargue, rivers, forests and biodiverse systems are maintained, hence\nproviding maximum options\u2014options in terms of experience,\nappreciation, values, and ways of life\u2014for the future human\ninhabitants of the planet (Norton 2005). The Brundtland report can\nalso be seen as advocating a form of strong sustainability in so far\nas it recommends that a \u201cfirst priority is to establish the\nproblem of disappearing species and threatened ecosystems on political\nagendas as a major resource issue\u201d (ibid., chapter 6,\nparagraph 57). Furthermore, despite its instrumental and economic\nlanguage, the report in fact endorses a wider moral perspective on the\nstatus of and our relation to nature and non-human species, evidenced\nby its statement that \u201cthe case for the conservation of nature\nshould not rest only with development goals. It is part of our moral\nobligation to other living beings and future generations\u201d (WCED\n1987, chapter 2, paragraph 55). Implicit in the statement is not only\na strong conception of sustainability but also a non-anthropocentric\nconception of the notion. Over time, strong sustainability came to be\nfocused not only on the needs of human and other living things but\nalso on their rights (Redclift 2004, 218). In a further development,\nthe discourses on forms of sustainability have generally given way to\na more ambiguous usage, in which the term \u201csustainability\u201d\nfunctions to bring people into a debate rather than setting out a\nclear definition of the terms of the debate itself. As globalization\nleads to greater integration of world economies, the world after the\nBrundtland report has seen greater fragmentation among viewpoints,\nwhere critics of globalization have generally used the concept of\nsustainability in a plurality of different ways (Sneddon, Howarth and\nNorgaard 2006). Some have argued that \u201csustainability\u201d,\njust like the word \u201cnature\u201d itself, has come to mean very\ndifferent things, carrying different symbolic meanings for different\ngroups, and reflecting very different interests (Redclift 2004, 220).\nFor better or for worse, such ambiguity can on occasion allow\ndifferent parties in negotiations to claim a measure of agreement. For\nexample, commenting on the connections between agricultural systems,\nsustainability and climate change, one writer has argued that there is\nexciting scope for negotiation across different world views in working\nout the conditions for a future sustainable form of agriculture\n(Thompson 2017).\n\nMeadows\u2019 and Daly\u2019s arguments about the need to recognize\nthat planetary resources are limited have continued to resonate with\nthinkers, especially those working in ecological economics (Daly and\nFarley 2011). As one author puts it, \u201cthe overriding aim [of\necological economics] ... is to seek viable responses to the biggest\ndilemma of our times: reconciling our aspirations for the good life\nwith the limitations and constraints of a finite planet\u201d\n(Jackson 2017, 3). While economic growth is a central focus of\nneoclassical economic theory (see the entry on\n philosophy of economics)\n a minority of thinkers have joined in supporting an agenda of\n\u201cde-growth\u201d (or \u201cdegrowth\u201d) as an alternative\nto what is sometimes called \u201cgrowthism\u201d (for a popular\noverview see Hickel 2020). From small beginnings in the late 20th\ncentury, the idea of de-growth developed from \u201ca political\nslogan with theoretical implications\u201d to become a significant\nchallenge to the idea of sustainable development considered as a kind\nof sustainable growth (Martinez-Alier et al. 2010).\nAdvocates of de-growth advocate that the transition to sustainability\nwill be aided by pursuing de-growth instead of economic growth\n(D\u2019Alisa et al. 2015, Khamara and Kronenbeg 2020). At the same\ntime some ecological economists argue for a rejection of the\nanthropocentrism they claim is central to neoclassical economics and\nsupport embracing a new ecological economics that explicitly\nincorporates an ecological ethic (Washington and Maloney 2020). Having\ndrawn attention to the huge impact of the human ecological footprint,\nRees has gone on to gloomily ponder the kind of economics needed to\ndeal with a situation in which \u201cwe are currently\n\u2018financing\u2019 economic growth by liquidating the biophysical\nsystems upon which humanity ultimately depends\u201d (Rees 2020, 1).\nHe concludes that \u201cthe mainstream fantasy\u2026...this\nobsession with growth, cannot end well\u201d (ibid., 6).\nAssuming that some forms of consumption are important to a satisfying\nhuman life, some writers have explored the idea that developing more\nmodes of virtual consumption, while reducing physical forms of\nconsumption, might be a significant contribution to sustainable\nlifestyles (Pike and DesRoches 2020).\n\nThe preservation of opportunities to live well, or at least to have a\nminimally acceptable level of well being, is at the heart of\n population ethics\n and many contemporary conceptions of sustainability. Many people\nbelieve such opportunities for the existing younger generations, and\nalso for the yet to arrive future generations, to be under threat from\ncontinuing environmental destruction, including loss of fresh water\nresources, continued clearing of wild areas, decreasing biodiversity\nand a changing climate thus raising questions not only about\nsustainability but also about environmental justice (see Gonzalez,\nAtapattu, and Seck 2021). Of these, climate change has come to\nprominence as an area of intense policy and political debate, to which\napplied philosophers and ethicists were slow to contribute (Heath\n2021). An early exploration of the topic by John Broome shows how the\neconomics of climate change could not be divorced from considerations\nof intergenerational justice and ethics (Broome 1992), and this has\nset the scene for subsequent discussions and analyses (see the entry\non\n climate justice).\n More than a decade later, when Stephen Gardiner analyses the state of\naffairs surrounding climate change in an article entitled \u201cA\nPerfect Moral Storm\u201d (Gardiner 2006), his starting point is also\nthat ethics plays a fundamental role in all discussions of climate\npolicy. But he argues that even if difficult ethical and conceptual\nquestions facing climate change (such as the so-called\n \u201cnon-identity problem\u201d\n along with the notion of\n historic injustices)\n could be answered, it would still be close to politically and\nsocially impossible to formulate, let alone to enforce, policies and\naction plans to deal effectively with climate change. This is due to\nthe multi-faceted nature of a problem that involves vast numbers of\nagents and players. At a global level, there is first of all the\npractical problem of motivating shared responsibilities (see the entry\non\n moral motivation)\n in part due to the dispersed nature of greenhouse gas emissions which\nmakes the effects of increasing levels of atmospheric carbon and\nmethane not always felt most strongly in the regions where they\noriginate. Add to this the fact that there is an un-coordinated and\nalso dispersed network of agents\u2014both individual and\ncorporate\u2014responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, and that\nthere are no effective institutions that can control and limit them.\nBut this tangle of issues constitutes, Gardiner argues, only one\nstrand in the skein of quandaries that confronts us. There is also the\nfact that by and large only the future (and perhaps the current\nyounger) generations will carry the brunt of the impacts of climate\nchange, explaining why so many people in the current generations seem\nnot to have strong enough incentive to act. Finally, he argues it is\nevident that mainstream political, economic, and ethical models are\nnot up to the task of reaching global consensus, and in many cases not\neven national consensus, on how best to design and implement fair\nclimate policies. Some consequentialist theorists, however, have\nargued that a form of\n rule consequentialism\n can take account of the interests of future generations who may be\ninhabiting a \"broken world\" (Mulgan 2011, 2017). Mulgan argues that by\nimagining a broken world of limited resources and precarious human\nsurvival, it may be possible to devise an ideal moral ooutlook that\ndiffers from the ideal code of many rule consequentialists who usually\npresuppose that the future will be just like the present.\n\nHowever, Gardiner takes a pessimistic view of the prospects for\nprogress on climate issues. His view includes pessimism about\ntechnical solutions, such as geoengineering as the antidote to climate\nproblems, echoing the concerns of others that large scale\ninterventions in\u2014and further domination of\u2014nature may turn\nout to be an even worse climate catastrophe (Gardiner 2011, ch 11,\nJamieson 1996 and see also the papers in Gardiner and McKinnon 2020).\nA key point in Gardiner\u2019s analysis is that the problem of\nclimate change involves a tangle of issues, the complexity of which\nconspires to encourage buck-passing, weakness of will, distraction and\nprocrastination, \u201cmak[ing] us extremely vulnerable to moral\ncorruption\u201d (ibid., 397; cf. Gardiner 2011; see also\nthe concept of \u201cwicked problem\u201d in Brennan 2004). Because\nof the grave risk of serious harm to current and future generations of\npeople and other living things, our failure to take timely mitigating\nactions on climate issues can be seen as a major moral failing,\nespecially in the light of our current knowledge and understanding of\nthe problem (IPCC 2021).\n\nIn a related reinterpretation of a classic study in psychology,\nRussell and Bolton re-examine Milgram\u2019s classic \u201cobedience\nstudies\u201d (see the entry on\n the concept of evil,\n section 4.5). In these experiments, Milgram explored the conditions\nunder which ordinary people would be disposed to perform evil actions\n(such as administering electric shocks to strangers). Russell and\nBolton argue that, when properly interpreted, Milgram\u2019s studies\nshow that political, administrative and bureaucratic structures can\nlead to a general and tacit agreement for those in an advantaged\nsituation to harm the interests of those less powerful. In Russell and\nBolton\u2019s new interpretation of the Milgram experiments, those\nwho are in the advantaged situation are those living comfortably in\nwealthy countries, while the powerless are distant strangers and\nmembers of future generations. Corporate structures and long\norganizational chains, Russell and Bolton argue, encourage inaction,\ndenial and diffusion of responsibility that typifies both the common\nresponses to climate change and also the behaviour of participants in\nMilgram\u2019s experiments. They conjecture that Milgram\u2019s work\nthus explains the phenomenon of what they call \u201cresponsibility\nambiguity\u201d that underlies hesitancy to take action on climate\nchange (Russell and Bolton 2019, and see also Rees 2020). While they\nmake no mention of the work of Hannah Arendt, their analysis recalls\nsome of Arendt\u2019s analysis of the banality of evil (see the entry\non\n the concept of evil,\n section 2.3). There appears to be scope for more empirical research\nand interdisciplinary study on topics such as the diffusion of\nresponsibility and denialism. A similar analysis might also apply to\ninaction in the face of declining biodiversity.\n\nJohn Broome tries to show some of the ways that one form of climate\ndenialism takes, when it uses ingenious but, Broome claims, flawed\nreasoning to depict individuals as making no significant contribution\nto climate change (Broome 2019, see also McKinnon 2014). A stronger\nform of denialism refuses to acknowledge the fact of anthropogenic\nclimate change at all. A puzzle remains over why much ingenuity is\nexpended on such denial in the face of the urgent problems that now\nconfront the world (see the entry on\n science and pseudo-science).\n In response, some argue that the persisting denialism over the\nreality of the environmental and climate crises may be a product of\nshame or guilt over the human treatment of natural things and systems\n(Aaltola 2021). These emotions may interfere with and block a\nmuch-needed and honest confrontation of a frightening\nsituation\u2014even if it is one humans have brought upon themselves.\nThere is also a well-known psychological phenomenon of \u201cknowing\nbut not knowing\u201d which can contribute, along with other factors,\nto denialism (Norgaard 2011, 404, and compare the classic studyof this\nin Cohen 2001, ch. 2). Many countries\u2019 initial and ongoing\nresponse to the 2020s COVID-19 pandemic, for example, appears to show\nthat denialism, typically accompanied by widespread misinformation and\nunfounded hypotheses about conspiracies, may be a very human way to\nreact in the face of a global catastrophe. Using factor analysis\nstudies, some psychologists have claimed to demonstrate that\nanti-scientific views have close association with beliefs in\ncreationism and animism. Further, they conjecture that purposive or\nteleological thinking is the gateway to such associations\n(Wagner-Egger et al. 2018). Note that the role of\n teleological notions in biology\n remains contested and subject to further research. Other research\nclaims to show that people simply reject scientific findings that make\nthem uncomfortable and threaten their worldviews (see Lewandowsky and\nOberauer 2016).\n\nWriters have also tried to make sense of why so much misinformation\nabout climate change and other catastrophes is so widespread. On the\npart of some theorists (see McIntyre 2018), the blame for the evils of\na \u201cpost-truth\u201d era has been laid at the feet of some\npostmodern thinkers who endorse\n social epistemology.\n But social constructionist writers have their own diagnosis of the\nsocial forces that have given rise to the \u201cnew climatic\nregime\u201d (Latour 2017), which combines science denialism and what\nhas be called \u201cout-of-this-world\u201d\u2014fanciful and\nover-optimistic\u2014thinking about the human prospects for escaping\nclimate catastrophe. One suggested remedy for these cognitve failings\nis to encourage the recognition that natural systems respond to human\naction and are not merely the material resources for economic\ndevelopment. It has been proposed that awareness that humans and the\nnatural systems that support them share a dwelling place might pave\nthe way to a new kind of \u201cterrestrial politics\u201d (Lenton\nand Latour 2018, Latour 2018). The shape of such a politics is still\nunder-theorized, and could take many forms (Mann and Wainwright 2018).\nMeanwhile, some animal ethicists blame \u201cspeciesist\nanthropocentrism\u201d (see the entry on\n the moral status of animals)\n for blinding humanity to the evils of its overpopulation and\ndenialism (Almiron and Tafalla 2019). Whatever the future holds, many\nthinkers insist that solving the problem of climate change is an\nessential ingredient of sustainability and that the alternative to\ndecisive action may result in the degrading not only of nature and\nnatural systems, but also of human dignity itself (see Nanda (ed.)\n2011, especially chapters by Heyd, Balafrej, Gutrich and Brennan and\nLo, see also section 3.4 of the entry on\n human rights).\n As humanity faces an uncertain future of declining biodiversity and\nincreasing extreme weather events driven by escalating planetary\nheating\u2014causing suffering and alienation for humans and\nnon-humans alike\u2014the moral challenges listed at the start of\nthis entry seem more pressing than ever.\n\nSupplementary Document:\n\nPathologies of Environmental Crisis: Theories and Empirical Research\n\n",
