    "main_text": "Metaphysics and philosophy of language || Presumption, \u201cap\u016brva,\u201d and the nature of the self\n3.3 Presumption, \u201cap\u016brva,\u201d and the nature of the self\n\n\nAmong the grounds for certain of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s claims regarding\nuniversals is the epistemic practice of arth\u0101patti, or\n\u201cnecessary presumption.\u201d This represents a doxastic\npractice admitted as distinct (i.e., as a pram\u0101\u1e47a)\nonly by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, with proponents of other schools of\nthought having regarded this as indistinct from inference\n(anum\u0101na). If there is a difference from inference as\nthat doxastic practice was systematized by Indian philosophers, it is\nperhaps that arth\u0101patti will not as readily admit of\nformalization; this represents, then, something more like inference\nto the best explanation\u2014the presumption or\n\u201cpositing\u201d (kalpan\u0101) of something without\nwhich some explanandum would not make sense. According to a stock\nexample, it must be supposed, of a corpulent person who never eats\nduring the daytime, that he eats at night. Kum\u0101rila appealed to\nthis mode of reasoning to argue, for example, for the necessity of\npositing universals as the referents of words; thus, what one\nunderstands, on rightly taking the meaning of a word, is that\n(a universal) without which the word\u2019s communicative\ncapacity would not be intelligible.\n\n\nThe same epistemic procedure is invoked, as well, to offer a peculiar\nalternative to the characteristically Buddhist view that awareness is\ninherently reflexive (that all awareness, that is, involves\nsvasa\u1e43vitti, or \u201cself-awareness\u201d).\nProfoundly wary of the significance of self-awareness in Buddhist\narguments for idealism\u2014Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s arguments for\nthe foundational character of self-awareness, for example, amount to a\ncase at least for the kind of epistemic idealism on which the\ndirect objects of awareness are mental representations (see Arnold\n2008)\u2014Kum\u0101rila was at pains to disallow that awareness is\nessentially reflexive. Against that idea, he held the counter-intuitive view that\nour awareness of ourselves as being aware is in fact a\npresumption from j\u00f1\u0101tat\u0101, the fact of\nsomething\u2019s \u201cbeing known.\u201d From the occurrence of an\nact of \u201cbeing known,\u201d that is, we presume there to have\nbeen an act of knowing, though that is not itself part of the\ncontent of our awareness. Lest this seem a manifestly untenable idea,\nit is worth noting that the broadly Sanskritic discussion of these\nissues typically took its bearings from grammarians\u2019 analyses of\nthe various factors relatable to a verb in any sentence; thus,\nKum\u0101rila, like other Indian philosophers who argued against the\nBuddhist doctrine of self-awareness, urged that it is incoherent to\nhold that the same thing could at once be agent and\npatient of a single act\u2014and if it is counter-intuitive\nto think, with Kum\u0101rila, of something\u2019s \u201cbeing\nknown\u201d prior to or independently of a subject\u2019s\nknowing that, it may make a difference that the guiding\nidea of \u201cbeing known\u201d is that of an act such as can be\nreferred to. \u201cBeing known,\u201d then, is here thought to\ncharacterize the objects of such acts, and is therefore not\nsomething itself to be known by introspection. (For a sympathetic reconstruction of this doctrine in a different context, see Siderits 2011.)\n\n\nMost controversially, Kum\u0101rila invoked the epistemic practice of\n\u201cnecessary presumption\u201d in arguing (at great length in the\nTantrav\u0101rttika) for the category of ap\u016brva,\nwhich it is hard not to consider a basically ad hoc category\nmeant to account for the efficacy of Vedic sacrificial rites.\nAp\u016brva denotes, then, the temporally remote consequences\nof ritual acts\u2014what it is, in other words, in virtue of which a\ncorrectly performed Vedic rite can be judged efficacious, even in the\nabsence of any immediately observed effect of the expected kind. The\nfelt need to posit such an entity follows from Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\nconvictions regarding the epistemic claim that is made (at least upon\nthe right kind of person) by Vedic injunctions. Thus, insofar as one\ncan (as Kum\u0101rila argued in elaborating the epistemology sketched\nin \u00a72, above) justifiably hold that Vedic injunctions make\ncontentful claims about matters of ultimate importance, and insofar as\nthe rites enjoined thereby are manifestly temporal events that are yet\nsaid to bear on always \u201cyet-to-be-realized\u201d states of\naffairs, it must be the case that something relates present, temporally\noccurrent ritual performances to the essentially imperceptible realm of\ndharma; for otherwise, the Vedic injunctions would be\nmeaningless.\n\n\nHere again, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s arguments relate closely to\nlinguistic preoccupations in light of which the point he makes can seem\nmore interesting than it might at first. With respect, then, to the\nquestion of what, in the Vedic texts, refers to the obscure\n\u201cap\u016brva\u201d he has thus posited, Kum\u0101rila\nholds that this should finally be understood as the referent of\nverbs; for nouns essentially denote already present things,\nwhereas it is verbs in virtue of which injunctive sentences enjoin\nactions that are always to be completed. (See, e.g.,\nTantrav\u0101rttika 2.2.1, ff.; and\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika,\nv\u0101ky\u0101dhikara\u1e47a, 330, ff.)\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s arguments here track, then, an often-cited\nhermeneutical maxim favored by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas:\u00a0\n\u201cwhat exists conduces to what is to be brought into being\u201d\n(bh\u016bta\u1e43 bhavy\u0101ya kalpate). It is, in other\nwords, the state of affairs whose \u201crealization\u201d\n(bh\u0101van\u0101) is expressed by the verb that should be\njudged predominant particularly in the injunctive sentences that\nrepresent, for M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43akas, the most important parts of\nthe Vedas. (See McCrea 2000.) So, just insofar as they refer to\nalready-present things, nouns refer to things that are essentially\nsubordinated to the realization (the\nbh\u0101van\u0101, or \u201cmaking real\u201d) of the\nacts that are what such sentences primarily enjoin; insofar,\nthen, as it is reasonable to think that verbs, too, must have\nreferents, and insofar as these referents are always essentially\nyet to be realized, Kum\u0101rila thinks it necessary to posit\nap\u016brva (the temporally remote consequence of ritual acts)\nas being, as it were, the \u201creferents\u201d of verbs. (See\nClooney 1990, 239, ff.; Halbfass 1991, 300\u2013307)\n\n\nOnce again, Kum\u0101rila can here be seen to take his bearings\nfrom the thought that what matters most is what is disclosed by the\nunique capacity of language somehow to bring into view\u2014indeed,\nto bring into being\u2014a world beyond what is actually\npresent. Kum\u0101rila\u2019s richly elaborated sense of our linguistic\nbeing thus reflects, above all, a guiding commitment to the view that\nVedic injunctions essentially enjoin the ongoing bringing into\nbeing of a ritual world that must continually be\nrenewed\u2014that, indeed, the world itself is sustained by Vedic\nsacrifice, which is rationally undertaken chiefly insofar as the texts\nthat enjoin this essentially transcend any particular human\nperspective.\n\n\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s confidence in the genuinely referential nature of\nlanguage is also reflected, finally, in his characteristic arguments\nfor the idea that it is an enduring \u0101tman\n(\u201cself\u201d) that is the underlying subject of all of our\nactions (and that therefore stands to realize, in the future, the\nfruits of Vedic practices). Like thinkers in the Brahmanical Ny\u0101ya\ntradition of philosophy, Kum\u0101rila (here closely following\n\u015aabara) was concerned to vindicate this conviction particularly in\nthe face of Buddhist arguments to the contrary (the claim that persons\nare \u201cwithout self,\u201d or an\u0101tma, being a\ncardinal Buddhist doctrine). Kum\u0101rila\u2019s intuitions in this\nregard center on the thought that \u201cthe notion\n\u2018I\u2019\u201d (aha\u1e43-pratyaya) must have a real\nreferent. That this is so, he argues, is directly experienced in the\ncase of memory, the content of which constitutively involves reference\nto \u201cI\u201d as the subject of past experiences now remembered.\nIn contrast, then, to arguments (such as those offered by many\nproponents of Ny\u0101ya) to the effect that memory\npresupposes an enduring subject, Kum\u0101rila\u2019s\ndistinctive claim is that in the always first-personally indexed\ncontent of mnemonic experience we really\n\u201cencounter\u201d the referent of the first-person pronoun.\nInsofar, that is, as it doesn\u2019t make sense to think one might\nremember an experience, and at the same time be uncertain about\nwhose experience it is that\u2019s remembered, it must be\nthought that there is in this case genuine \u201crecognition\u201d\n(pratyabhij\u00f1\u0101) of the referent of \u201cthe\nnotion \u2018I\u2019.\u201d (See, especially,\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika, \u0101tmav\u0101da, verses\n107\u2013110; Jha 1983, trans., 401\u201302; Taber 1990.)\n\n\nInterestingly, Buddhists like Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti take\nthe phenomenologically second-order character of memory here identified\nby Kum\u0101rila\u2014the fact, that is, that mnemonic awareness is phenomenologically\ndistinct from present awareness in virtue of the explicitly reflexive character of memory\u2014as evidence only that moments of awareness have a reflexive aspect. That momentary mental states are thus characterized by their \u201cself-awareness\u201d is, for these Buddhists, nothing like awareness of a self; rather, it is something like the fact that moments of cognition are self-intimating. (On svasa\u1e43vitti, see Ganeri 1999, Kellner 2010, Thompson 2011.)\n\n\nKum\u0101rila, we noted at the beginning of this section, is deeply\nresistant to the Buddhist doctrine of self-awareness, insofar as that\nis enlisted by these Buddhists as evidence for the idealist claim that\nwe are, finally, indubitably aware only of the content of our own\nmental states. Against, though, the Buddhist appeal to the\nphenomenologically distinctive character of memory, Kum\u0101rila can\nargue that it is not moments of subjectivity that we encounter in memory, but rather the fact that the subject who now remembers is the same\nas the subject disclosed in the remembered experience. Not momentariness but continuity is the most phenomenologically salient feature of memory\u2014and insofar as Kum\u0101rila here again takes his bearings from the guiding epistemological intuition that we are generally justified in taking awareness\nas veridically disclosing just what it seems to us to disclose. While Buddhists like Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti propose, then,\nan explanation of personhood that is counter-intuitive in light of the\nphenomenally continuous character of awareness, Kum\u0101rila\ncan again invoke his characteristic epistemological doctrine; thus, he\nargues not only that we are prima facie justified in believing\nourselves really to be as we seem (particularly in the case of\nmemory) to ourselves to be, but also that there is finally nothing that\ncan be taken to override that conviction. (See \u0101tmav\u0101da\nverses 125\u201326 [Jha 1983, 405], and, as well, Taber 1990.)\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s account of the self, then, represents another expression of the common-sense realism that informs his entire project.\n",
