    "main_text": "Problems and Prospects || The dream-skeptical problem: judgment, problematic idealism, and the gap in the Second Analogy\n4.3 The dream-skeptical problem: judgment, problematic idealism, and the gap in the Second Analogy\n\nAs we saw in the supplement\n Completing the Picture of Kant\u2019s Metaphysics of Judgment,\n the Second Analogy of Experience, if true, guarantees both the\nobjectivity and the universal diachronic or temporally successive\ncausal necessitation of objects of experience and all of their parts,\nunder natural laws. As we also saw in Section 1.3, the\n\u201ccriterion of empirical truth\u201d for a judgment of\nexperience says that since the objectively valid propositional content\nof an empirical judgment can be specified as a necessary conceptual\nrule of sensory appearances or objects, then if that rule is\neffectively applied to the temporal succession of our sensory\nrepresentations of the phenomenal material world, and that\nrule coheres with the causal-dynamic laws of nature, then\nthat judgment is true. And finally, as we also saw in Section 3.1, the\ncentrality thesis, the priority-of-the-proposition thesis, and the\ntranscendental idealism thesis jointly entail the\n\u201ctranscendental truth\u201d of judgment, which is that\nnecessarily every well-generated judgment of experience is true and\ncorresponds to an actual object of experience, that is, to an actual\nempirical fact.\n\nBut here is a simple objection to this three-part doctrine, borrowed\nfrom Descartes\u2019s famous \u201cdream skepticism\u201d in the\nfirst of the Meditations on First Philosophy. Kant calls this\nform of skepticism \u201cproblematic idealism\u201d (B274). To\ngenerate the relevant version of problematic idealism, suppose that\nall the sensory appearances or objects currently falling under the\nSecond Analogy, the criterion of empirical truth, and the principle of\ntranscendental truth are nothing but causally well-ordered parts\nof my inner sense alone. Then any object of experience\ncorresponding to my currently true judgment of experience might be\nnothing but a very coherent dream or a hallucination. Nothing Kant has\nsaid can rule this out. Even the famous Refutation of Idealism in the\nfirst Critique, if sound, says only that \u201cinner\nexperience is possible only through outer experience in general\u201d\n(B278\u2013279), and Kant explicitly concedes that at any given time,\nfor all we know, we could be dreaming or hallucinating:\n\nfrom the fact that the existence of outer objects is required for the\npossibility of a determinate consciousness of our self it does not\nfollow that every intuitive representation of outer things includes at\nthe same time their existence, for that may well be the mere effect of\nthe imagination (in dreams as well as delusions). (B278)\n\n\nSo even if inner experience and outer experience are necessarily\nconnected in general, the truth and objectivity of any\nparticular judgment of experience, by Kant\u2019s own\ncriteria for truth and objectivity, are consistent with the\npossibility that the particular object of experience corresponding to\nthat judgment is nothing but very coherent dream or a hallucination.\nAfter all, I can perfectly well dream or hallucinate a boat\ngoing downstream, as well as actually seeing one. It is true\nthat Kant does remark in the General Note on the System of Principles\nin the B edition of the first Critique that \u201cin order\nto understand the possibility of things in accordance with the\ncategories, and thus to establish the objective reality of the latter,\nwe do not merely need intuitions, but always outer intuitions\u201d\n(B291). This seems correct. But unfortunately, given what Kant says at\nB278, nothing in his transcendentally idealistic metaphysics of\njudgment will guarantee that any set of sensory appearances or objects\nsatisfying his criteria for the truth and objectivity of judgments of\nexperience on any particular occasion will in fact be material objects\nin space corresponding to outer intuitions, and not merely causally\nwell-ordered mental imagery corresponding to inner intuitions, i.e.,\nmere \u201cphantoms of my brain.\u201d So the Second Analogy\u2019s\ncriterion of objectivity is ultimately insufficient to yield the\nempirical truth of judgments of experience, despite Kant\u2019s\nexplicit claim that this criterion does yield both their objective\nvalidity and their empirical truth (A202/B247).\n",
