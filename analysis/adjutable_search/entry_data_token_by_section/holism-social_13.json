    "main_text": "Why Purely Holist Explanations Can Sometimes Stand on Their Own || The Argument from Explanatory Practices\n4.4 The Argument from Non-Mechanistic Explanatory Considerations\n\nThe argument from non-mechanistic explanation purports to show that if\nnon-mechanistic considerations as to what constitutes an explanation\n(or at least a satisfactory or complete explanation) are adopted, then\npurely holist explanations may sometimes stand on their own.\n\nOne version of the argument takes as its starting point the erothetic\nmodel of explanation, according to which explanations are, roughly\nspeaking, answers to why-questions. Equipped with this model of\nexplanation, Jeroen Van Bouwel considers the contrastive question as\nto why the French Revolution broke out in 1789, and not in 1750 (Van\nBouwel 2006). Following Theda Skocpol\u2019s work, he suggests that\ncertain structural conditions made the revolution possible in 1789,\nand that these conditions were not present in 1750. In 1789, but not\nin 1750, the French state was economically weak because of the\nsubstantial resources that had gone into the American War of\nIndependence, and because of the growing economic competition with\nEngland. This contrastive explanation is expressed in purely holist\nterms. Moreover, Van Bouwel contends that it constitutes a perfectly\nsatisfactory\u2014and complete\u2014answer to the contrastive\nquestion. Adding an account of how the state\u2019s weakness led\nvarious individuals to adopt certain beliefs and desires, and to act\nin ways that ultimately led to the French Revolution, would not render\nthe explanation any better. Elaborating on this point, Van Bouwel\nconcludes that in response to contrastive questions, purely holist\nexplanations do not invariably need to be complemented by accounts of\nthe underlying individual-level mechanisms.\n\nAnother version of the argument has been offered by Julian Reiss, who\ndraws attention to the fact that two types of social phenomena may be\ncausally linked by many different types of underlying individual-level\nmechanisms (Reiss 2013: 111). As an illustration of this point, he\nnotes that an increase in the supply of currency tends to make prices\ngo up, and that this may happen via multiple types of underlying\nindividual-level mechanisms. Consequently, when faced with the task of\nexplaining a particular case of prices having gone up, there are two\noptions. One option is to appeal to the tendency of an increase in the\nmoney supply to make the prices go up; the other is to refer to this\ntendency while supplementing this with an account of the underlying\nindividual-level mechanisms. The point is that we may sometimes prefer\nexplanations that are applicable to a large number of individual\ncases, in which case we should opt for the purely holist explanation.\nIf an account of the underlying individual-level mechanisms is\nincluded, the explanation will not hold for all the cases in which the\nmechanisms are of a different type (2013: 114). Therefore, Reiss\nargues, it is not correct that purely holist explanations should\nalways be accompanied by accounts of the individual-level\nmicrofoundations; sometimes purely holist explanations may stand on\ntheir own.\n",
