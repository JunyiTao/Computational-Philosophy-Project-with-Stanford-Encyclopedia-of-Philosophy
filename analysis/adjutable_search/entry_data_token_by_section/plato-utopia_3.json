The Social and Political Institutions of Magnesia\n\nThis section provides a brief overview of the basic social and\npolitical institutions of Magnesia. Magnesia will be located in a part\nof Crete that has been left empty by an ancient migration and is about\nten miles from the sea. The site is basically self-sufficient in\nresources without having much excess to export. Plato sees this\nunsuitability for active commerce and distance from the sea as\nadvantages: they discourage the maritime and commercial activities\nthat corrupt cities by fostering a love of money-making in the\ncitizens and by allowing close contact with foreigners who bring\ninnovation and have not received the good ethical education afforded\nto Magnesians.\n\nThe city will be relatively populous: its number of households is to\nremain permanently at\n 5,040.[20]\n Immigration and emigration policies are designed to avoid population\nexcess and deficiency. Each household will have an allotment\nconsisting of two plots of land: one nearer the city\u2019s center\nand one nearer its borders. Each household\u2019s allotment is\nintended to be equally productive (Laws 737CE, 745CD) and to\nsupport a comfortable, although not luxurious, life for the\nhousehold\u2019s members. The households and land are not owned or\nfarmed in common, but each shareholder must consider his share to be\nat the same time the common property of the whole city (Laws\n740A3\u20136). Part of the sense in which the lot is in common is\nthat it is inalienable and cannot be divided or aggregated: the\nassignment of the lot to a household is intended to support the\nhousehold throughout the generations. (There are also restrictions on\nthe use of the\n land.[21]\n ) Further, each household will help, out of its own resources, to\nfund Magnesia\u2019s system of common\n meals.[22]\n Plato establishes four property classes: the members of the top or\nfirst class have assets worth between three and four times the value\nof the lot (and the tools and animals needed to farm it), the second\nclass between two and three times this value and so\n on.[23]\n Anything accumulated over the highest amount will be confiscated by\nthe city (Laws 744D\u2013745A). Such assets do not include\ngold and silver, since these may be possessed only by the city; there\nwill be only a token currency (Laws\n 742AB).[24]\n\nMany of Magnesia\u2019s inhabitants are not citizens. There is a\nconsiderable slave population (including both public and private\nslaves) and they, of course, are not citizens. Also found within the\ncity are transient foreigners and resident foreigners (metics) who may\nstay for twenty years. Slaves and foreigners are an economic necessity\nfor the city for they will carry on the trading, manufacturing and\nmenial occupations that are barred to citizens. The lot holders or\nheads of households are citizens, but citizenship is not restricted to\nthem and owning land is not a necessary condition of citizenship. The\nsons and heirs of lot holders are called \u201ccitizens\u201d and\nare liable to military service at age 20, can participate in elections\nat that age and can serve in office at\n 30.[25]\n They will not inherit the household lot, however, until their father\ndies. What of women? In Magnesia, the private family is not abolished.\nAlthough women lack an independent right to own property, they are\nliable to military training and service and attend their own common\nmeals (Laws 780D). The Athenian holds that they can attain\nthe four cardinal virtues and for this reason requires that they be\neducated (Laws 804D\u2013805A). For Aristotle, women are not\ncitizens of the ideal city, since they are excluded from political\noffice. But in Magnesia, women can participate in elections and hold\npolitical office and the Athenian explicitly counts them as citizens\n(Laws\n 814C2\u20134).[26]\n\nLet us turn to the political system or constitution\n(politeia) of Magnesia. Magnesia has a rich variety of\noffices, but the main ones are: the Assembly (koinos\nsullogos, ekkl\u00easia), the Council\n(boul\u00ea), the magistrates, especially the guardians of\nthe laws (nomophulakes), the courts and the Nocturnal Council\n(nukterinos sullogos). The Nocturnal Council is discussed in\nmore detail below in section 6.\n\nThe Assembly is the main electoral authority in the city; it is\ncomposed of all citizens, or more precisely, all those who have served\nor are serving in the military. The Assembly is responsible for the\nelection of most of the city\u2019s officers and magistrates. The\nother functions explicitly given to it are\n\na role in judging offenses against the public,\nmaking awards of merit,\nextending the term of residence for metics, and\npassing on proposed changes in the laws, at least those regarding\ndances and sacrifices.\n\n\nIt may also have other responsibilities in connection with foreign\n affairs.[27]\n\nThe Council is composed of 90 members chosen by election from each\nproperty class for a total of 360 members. Men are eligible for office\nat age 30, women at age 40. Members serve one-year terms. The Council\nexercises ordinary administrative powers, such as calling and\ndissolving the Assembly, receiving foreign ambassadors, supervising\nelections and so on.\n\nThe guardians of the laws (nomophulakes) are composed of 37\ncitizens, at least fifty years of age who serve from the time of their\nelection until age 70 (Laws 755A). There are four ways in\nwhich the nomophulakes guard the\n laws:[28]\n\nAlthough they do not seem to have the authority to discipline\nother magistrates, they are assigned the general task of supervising\nthem and are expected to bring appropriate cases to the attention of\nthe proper officials.\nThey exercise wide supervisory powers over citizens in general\nand, for example, are charged with fining those who spend excessively,\ngranting permission to travel abroad and overseeing the care of\norphans.\nThey possess various judicial functions and are in charge of\nespecially important or difficult cases involving the family, property\nand the abuse of laws.\nPerhaps their most important task is the revision and\nsupplementation of the existing laws, although the extent of revision\npossible is\n controversial.[29]\n\n\nFinally, there is an extensive system of courts in Magnesia, both\npublic and private. One of Plato\u2019s major innovations, compared\nwith Athenian law, is the elaborate structure of appeals in judicial\ncases. It is worth noting that Plato holds that citizens, in virtue of\ntheir standing in the political community, may legitimately expect to\nhave a share in the administration of justice (Laws\n767E9\u2013768B3).\n",
