    "main_text": "Introduction to Transitional Justice\n1. Introduction to Transitional Justice\n The term \u201cTransitional Justice\u201d has come, in recent\nyears, to designate a field of academic inquiry, as well as political\npractice, concerned with the aftermath of conflict and large-scale\nhuman rights abuses. Theorists and practitioners of transitional\njustice focus on the most effective and legitimate ways of addressing\npast wrongs and moving towards the (re)establishment of a decent civil\norder. In this introduction, I describe the political and moral goals\nofficials tend to pursue in transitional settings and map out some of\nthe tensions between these goals. I argue that such strains are the\nresult of an endemic friction between the demands of stability and\njustice after war (the introduction draws on Eisikovits 2013).\n",
