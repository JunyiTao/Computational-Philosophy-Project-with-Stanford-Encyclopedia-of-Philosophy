    "main_text": "\n\nNicolaus Taurellus (b. 1547 Montb\u00e9liard, d. 1606 Altdorf) is\none of the early modern German philosophers who re-established\nmetaphysics as a topic of serious academic inquiry in the Lutheran\ntradition. He adhered to the pious goal of providing a unified account\nof philosophical and theological truth, but in doing so he developed a\nseries of controversial claims, such as the view that the basic\nconstituents of reality are immaterial, form-like entities. In\ncontrast to traditional form-matter composites, he maintained that\nsuch form-like entities fulfill the criterion of\nsubstantiality\u2014the capacity of subsisting independently of other\nentities. At the same time, he held that the composition of immaterial\nentities can form only accidental, non-substantial unities. His\nconclusion that human beings are only accidental, non-substantial\nunities was perceived as a challenge to traditional views of\npersonhood. During his lifetime, Taurellus\u2019s philosophy met\nfierce opposition from orthodox Lutheran theologians. Still, his\nmetaphysics prefigures some basic ideas of the metaphysics of Leibniz,\nwho knew Taurellus\u2018s philosophy and thought highly of it.\n",
