    "main_text": "Self-Respect\n4. Self-Respect\n\nWhile there is much controversy about respect for persons and other\nthings, there is surprising agreement among moral and political\nphilosophers about at least this much concerning respect for oneself:\nself-respect is something of great importance in everyday life.\nIndeed, it is regarded both as morally required and as essential to\nthe ability to live a satisfying, meaningful, flourishing life\u2014a\nlife worth living\u2014and just as vital to the quality of our lives\ntogether. Saying that a person has no self-respect or acts in a way no\nself-respecting person would act, or that a social institution\nundermines the self-respect of some people, is generally a strong\nmoral criticism. Nevertheless, as with respect itself, there is\nphilosophical disagreement, both real and merely apparent, about the\nnature, scope, grounds, and requirements of self-respect. Self-respect\nis often defined as a sense of worth or as due respect for oneself; it\nhas been analyzed in various ways: it is treated as a moral duty\nconnected with the duty to respect all persons, as something to which\nall persons have a right and which it would be unjust to undermine, as\na moral virtue essential to morally good living, and as something one\nearns by living up to demanding standards. Self-respect is frequently\n(but not always correctly) identified with or compared to self-esteem,\nself-confidence, dignity, self-love, a sense of honor, self-reliance,\npride, and it is contrasted (but not always correctly) with servility,\nshame, humility, self-abnegation, arrogance, self-importance.\nUnderstanding how, if at all, self-respect is connected with and\ndifferent from these other attitudes and stances is important to\nhaving a good understanding of self-respect and the other things.\n\nIn addition to the questions philosophers have addressed about respect\nin general, other questions have been of particular concern to those\ninterested in self-respect, such as: (1) What is self-respect, and how\nis it connected to or different from related notions such as\nself-esteem, self-confidence, pride, and so on? How are respect for\npersons and respect for oneself alike and unalike? (2) How is\nself-respect related to such things as moral rights, virtue, autonomy,\nintegrity, and identity? (3) Is there a moral duty to respect\nourselves as there is a duty to recognition respect others? (4) Are\nthere objective conditions\u2014for example, moral standards or\ncorrect judgments\u2014that a person must meet in order to have\nself-respect, or is self-respect a subjective phenomenon that gains\nsupport from any sort of self-valuing without regard to correctness or\nmoral acceptability? (5) Does respecting oneself conceptually entail\nor causally require or lead to respecting other persons (or anything\nelse)? And how are respect for other persons and respect for oneself\nalike and unalike? (6) What features of an individual\u2019s\npsychology and experience, what aspects of the social context, and\nwhat modes of interactions with others support or undermine\nself-respect? (7) Are social institutions and practices to be judged\njust or unjust (at least in part) by how they affect self-respect? Can\nconsiderations of self-respect help us to better understand the nature\nand wrongness of injustices such as oppression and to determine\neffective and morally appropriate ways to resist or end them?\n",
