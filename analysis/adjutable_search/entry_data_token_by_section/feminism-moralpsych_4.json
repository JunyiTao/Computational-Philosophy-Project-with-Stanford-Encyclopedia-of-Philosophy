    "main_text": "Responsibility || Collective Responsibility\n3.3 Collective Responsibility\n\nSome feminists have recently introduced the notion of collective\nresponsibility, which would serve to hold men as a group responsible\nfor aspects of women\u2019s oppression. Writing about rape in\nparticular, which we can take to be a facet of women\u2019s\noppression, Larry May and Robert Strikwerda argue that in some\nsocieties, men are collectively responsible for rape because most if\nnot all men contribute to its prevalence (1999, 722). According to May\nand Strikwerda, rape is a crime perpetrated by men as a group, not\njust by the individual rapist. Acts of rape take place in what is\ncalled a \u201crape culture,\u201d in which individual men are more\nlikely to engage in rape when they are in groups, and men are strongly\nencouraged to rape by being socialized to be patriarchal men. May and\nStrikwerda cite data that young men in our society engage in more rape\nthan previously thought, and that rapists are not significantly\npsychologically different from other males in our society. They agree\nwith research suggesting that all-male groups socialize their members\nand provide cultural \u201ccues\u201d for violence, which serves as\nevidence that rape is not best thought of as an isolated act performed\nby just the rapist. They defend what they call \u201cdistributive\ncollective responsibility,\u201d which is the view that men form a\ngroup in which there are many features, including attitudes or\ndispositions to harm others, common to all or most members of the\ngroup, making what is true for one man true for all other men\n(728).\n\nThe key to understanding distributive collective responsibility is\nunderstanding patriarchy as being based on common interests and\nbenefits extended to all men in a given society, and rendering each at\nleast partially responsible for the harms of patriarchy. All men\nbenefit from the existence of rape because women are made to feel\ndependent on men for protection from rapists. Significantly, May and\nStrikwerda argue that some men, in the way they interact with other\nmen, contribute to a climate in which rape is made more prevalent,\nsuch as when they participate in the practice of \u201cmale\nbonding\u201d which separates them from women who they deem to be\n\u201cother.\u201d Moreover, some men would be rapists if given the\nopportunity, since they share the same attitudes as rapists about rape\nand about women. Such factors make men collectively responsible for\nrape, and thus for at least part of women\u2019s oppression. In\nanother article on shared responsibility and racist attitudes, whose\narguments apply equally to sexist attitudes, May argues that\n\u201cinsofar as people share in the production of an attitudinal\nclimate, they participate in something like a joint venture that\nincreases the likelihood of harm\u201d (1992, 47). May expands on\ntraditional, individualistic responsibility accounts by assigning at\nleast some responsibility to those who themselves do not commit racist\nacts, but who harbor racist attitudes in a climate in which others are\nthereby more likely to act on their racist attitudes and cause harm.\nThus a person can share responsibility for harms the person does not\ndirectly cause: men who harbor sexist attitudes contribute to a\nclimate in which other men who have sexist attitudes act on them, and\nare partly responsible for the harmful behavior.\n",
