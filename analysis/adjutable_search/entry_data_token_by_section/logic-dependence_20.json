In this formalism, teams are replaced by quantum\nteams, which differ from the ordinary teams of propositional team\nlogic in that they allow for the values of certain variables to be\nindeterminate with respect to certain valuations and in that\nthey allow for multiple instances of the same valuation (thus adding a\nquantitative aspect to team semantics). A semantics is then defined\nover quantum teams for a language that allows for the specification of\ninequalities concerning the probabilities of events, and a\nsound and complete proof system is developed for it; and finally, it\nis shown that Bell\u2019s inequalities admit counterexamples\nin this systems, as they do according to the predictions of quantum\nmechanics and according to experimental evidence (Einstein, Podolsky,\n& Rosen 1935; Bell 1964; Aspect, Grangier, & Roger 1981),\nwhile they do not so in the classical version of this\nframework.",
