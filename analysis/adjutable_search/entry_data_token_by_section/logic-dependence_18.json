More in general, the dependency atoms and\nconnectives of studied in team semantics admit natural interpretations\nin terms of belief states and belief updates, as\ndiscussed in (Galliani 2015). At this time, the exact nature of the\nrelationship between such logics and dynamic-epistemic logic and its\nvariants (Van Ditmarsch, van Der Hoek, & Kooi 2007) is largely\nunexplored, but there is ample reason to suspect further connections\nbetween these two areas of mathematical and philosophical logic.\n",
