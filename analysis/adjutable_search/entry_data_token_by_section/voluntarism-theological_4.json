    "main_text": "Metaethical theological voluntarism || Considerations in Favor\n2.1 Considerations in Favor\n\nThe considerations to be offered in favor of theological voluntarism\nare, at this level, similarly abstract. I will discuss three types of\nconsideration: historical, theological, and\nmetaethical.\nHistorical considerations in favor of theological voluntarism\n\nSome of the considerations in favor of metaethical theological\nvoluntarism are historical. Both theists and nontheists have been\nimpressed by the extent to which at least some moral concepts\ndeveloped in tandem with theological concepts, and it may therefore be\nthe case that there could be no adequate explication of some moral\nconcepts without appeal to theological ones. On this view, it is not\nmerely historical accident that at least some moral concepts had their\norigin in contexts of theistic belief and practice; rather, these\nconcepts have their origin essentially in such contexts, and become\ndistorted and unintelligible when exported from those contexts (see,\nfor example, Anscombe 1958).\nTheological considerations in favor of theological voluntarism\n\nSome of the considerations in favor of theological voluntarism have\ntheir source in matters regarding the divine nature. Several such\narguments are summarized in Idziak 1979 (pp. 8\u201310). Some appeal\nto omnipotence: since God is both omnipotent and impeccable,\ntheological voluntarism must be true: for if God cannot act in a way\nthat is morally wrong, then God\u2019s power would be limited by\nother normative states of affairs were theological voluntarism not the\ncase. Some appeal to God\u2019s freedom: since God is free\nand impeccable, theological voluntarism must be true: for if moral\nrequirements existed prior to God\u2019s willing them, requirements\nthat an impeccable God could not violate, God\u2019s liberty would be\ncompromised. Some appeal to God\u2019s status as supremely\nlovable and deserving of allegiance: if theism is\ntrue, then the world of value must be a theocentric one, and so any\nmoral view that does not place God at its center is bound to be\ninadequate. Even if individually insufficient as justifications for\nadopting theological voluntarism, collectively they may suggest some\ndesiderata for a moral view: that God must be at the center of a moral\ntheory, and, in particular, that the realm of the moral must be\ndependent on God\u2019s free choices. It seems that any moral theory\nthat met these desiderata would count as a version of theological\nvoluntarism.\nMetaethical considerations in favor of theological voluntarism\n\nA third set of considerations in favor of theological voluntarism has\nits source in metaethics proper, in the attempt to provide adequate\nphilosophical accounts of the various formal features exhibited by\nmoral concepts, properties, and states of affairs. One might claim,\nthat is, that theological voluntarism makes the best sense of the\nformal features of morality that both theists and nontheists\nacknowledge.\n\nConsider first the normativity of morals. Both theists and\nnontheists have been impressed by the weirdness of normativity, with\nits very otherness, and have thought that whatever we say about\nnormativity, it will have to be a story not about natural properties\nbut nonnatural ones (cf. Moore 1903, section 13). John Mackie, an\natheist, and George Mavrodes, a theist, have both drawn from this the\nsame moral: if there is a God, then the normativity of morality can be\nunderstood in theistic terms; otherwise, the normativity of morality\nis unintelligible (Mavrodes 1986; Mackie 1977, p. 48). As Robert Adams\nhas suggested, given the serious difficulties present in understanding\nmoral properties as natural properties, it is worthwhile taking\nseriously the hypothesis that morality is not just a nonnatural matter\nbut a supernatural one (Adams 1973, p. 105). For the standard\nobjections against understanding normativity as a nonnatural property\nconcern our inability to say anything further about that nonnatural\nproperty itself and about our ability to grasp that property (see,\ne.g., M. Smith 1994, pp. 21\u201325). But if morality is to be\nunderstood in terms of God\u2019s commands, we can give an\ninformative account of what these unusual properties are; and if it is\nunderstood in terms of God\u2019s commands, then we can give an\ninformative account of how God, being the creator and sustainer of us\nrational beings, can ensure that we can have an adequate epistemic\ngrasp of the moral domain (Adams 1979a, pp. 137\u2013138).\n\nConsider next the impartiality of morals. The domain of the\nmoral, unlike the domain of value generally, is governed by the\nrequirements of impartiality. To use Sidgwick\u2019s phrase, the\npoint of view of morality is not one\u2019s personal point of view\nbut rather \u201cthe point of view \u2026 of the Universe\u201d\n(Sidgwick 1907, p. 382). But, to remark on the perfectly obvious, the\nUniverse does not have a point of view. Various writers have employed\nfictions to try to provide some sense to this idea: Adam Smith\u2019s\nimpartial and benevolent spectator, Firth\u2019s ideal observer, and\nRawls\u2019 contractors who see the world sub specie\naeternitatis come to mind most immediately (Smith 1759, Pt III,\nCh 8; Firth 1958; and Rawls 1971, p. 587). But theological voluntarism\ncan provide a straightforward understanding of the impartiality of\nmorals by appealing to the claim that the demands of morality arise\nfrom the demands of someone who in fact has an impartial and supremely\ndeep love for all of the beings that are morality\u2019s proper\nobjects.\n\nConsider next the overridingness of morals. The domain of the\nmoral, it is commonly thought, consists in a range of values that can\ndemand absolute allegiance, in the sense that it is never reasonable\nto act contrary to what those values finally require. One deep\ndifficulty with this view, formulated in a number of ways but perhaps\nmost memorably by Sidgwick (1907, pp. 497\u2013509), is that it is\nhard to see how moral value automatically trumps other kinds of value\n(e.g. prudential value) when they conflict. But if the domain of the\nmoral is to be understood in terms of the will of a being who can make\nit possible that, or even ensure that, the balance of reasons is\nalways in favor of acting in accordance with the moral demand, then\nthe overridingness of morals becomes far easier to explain (Layman\n2006; Evans 2013, pp. 29\u201330).\n\nConsider next the content of morals. There is a strong case\nto be made that moral judgments cannot have just any content: they\nmust be concerned, somehow, with what exhibits respect for certain\nbeings, or with what promotes their interests (cf. Foot 1958, pp.\n510\u2013512; M. Smith 1994, p. 40; Cuneo & Shafer-Landau 2014,\npp. 404\u2013407). Theological voluntarism has a ready explanation\nfor the content of morals being what it is: it is that moral demands\narise from a being that loves that being\u2019s creation.\n\nSo there are some general reasons to think theological voluntarism\npromising. The reasons are stronger yet when one is proceeding from\ntheistic starting points. (This is not trivial, since a number of\ntheistic philosophers reject theological voluntarism.) But these\nreasons, while suggestive, are rather generic: they point to the\npromise possessed by theological voluntarism, though they do not fix\nfor us on a particular formulation of the view. The general schema for\na particular theological voluntarist position is \u2018evaluative\nstatus M stands in dependence relation D to divine\nact A\u2019 (cf. Quinn 1999, p. 53, which I follow here\nexcept to substitute the more general \u2018evaluative\u2019 for\nQuinn\u2019s more specific \u2018moral\u2019). So there are at\nleast three choices that have to be made. We need to say something\nabout\n what sorts of evaluative statuses\n depend on God\u2019s will. We need to say something about what are\nthe\n relevant acts of divine will.\n And we need to say something about what the\n dependence relation\n is supposed to be. (These are not independent questions, of\ncourse.)\n",
