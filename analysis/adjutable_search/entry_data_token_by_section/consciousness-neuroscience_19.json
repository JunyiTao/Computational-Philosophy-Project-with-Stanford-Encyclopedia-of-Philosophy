Neuroscience of Generic Consciousness: Unconscious Vision as Case Study\n\nSince generic consciousness is a matter of a state\u2019s being\nconscious or not, we can examine work on specific types of mental\nstate that shift between being conscious or not and isolate neural\nsubstrates. Work on unconscious vision provides an informative\nexample. In the past decades, scientists have argued for unconscious\nseeing and investigated its brain basis especially in\nneuropsychology, the study of subjects with brain damage.\nInterestingly, if there is unconscious seeing, then the intentional\naction inference must be restricted in scope since some intentional\nbehaviors might be guided by unconscious perception\n (section 2.5).\n That is, the existence of unconscious perception blocks a direct\ninference from perceptually guided intentional behavior to perceptual\nconsciousness. The case study of unconscious vision promises to\nilluminate more specific studies of generic consciousness along with\nhaving repercussions for how we attribute conscious states.\n",
