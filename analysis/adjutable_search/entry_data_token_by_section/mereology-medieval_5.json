    "main_text": "Wholes || Universal wholes\n2.2 Universal wholes\n\nMany non-material items are considered to be integral wholes. But most\nmedieval philosophers mark off one special sort of non-material\nobject, the universal, and treat it as a separate type of whole.\n\nIt was noted in\n Section 1.1\n that universals, and especially species and their genera, are related\nto one another hierarchically. For instance, the species Human Being\nand the species Horse both fall under the genus Animal. Additionally,\nindividuals are related hierarchically to their species and genera.\nHence, Socrates and Cicero fall under the species Human Being and the\ngenus Animal. These relations between universals and individuals are\noften described in the terms of collection and division. Cicero and\nSocrates and all other humans are collected into the species Human\nBeing, and the species Human Being and Horse and all other species are\ncollected in the genus Animal. Correlatively, Animal is divided into\nits species, and Human Being is divided into individual humans.\n\nThis language of collection and division invites medieval philosophers\nto call the divisible items wholes, and the products of these\ndivisions parts, but most medieval philosophers are not tempted to\nthink that universals are literally composed out of\nindividuals or lesser species. There are noteworthy exceptions. For\nexample, an anonymous twelfth-century philosopher carefully\narticulates and spiritedly defends a version of what is often called\nthe collection (collectio) theory of universals\n(Pseudo-Joscelin De generibus et speciebus \u00a7\u00a7\n84\u2013153 (2014, 158\u201385)). But, in general, universal wholes\nare clearly marked off from other kinds of whole, and their behavior\nis thought to be distinct from the behavior of potential and integral\nwholes.\n\nThere is one significant complication. In his On Division,\nBoethius distinguishes between the division of a genus and the\ndivision of a whole (877c\u2013d, see also In Cic. top.\n331.18\u201319). But then under his treatment of the ways to divide\nwholes, he notes that one way to divide a true whole is to divide a\nuniversal into its subordinate individuals (887d). That a universal\ncan be a true whole will matter below when we try to uncover the\nproperties that differentiate one kind of part-whole relation from\nothers (Section\n 3.3).\n",
