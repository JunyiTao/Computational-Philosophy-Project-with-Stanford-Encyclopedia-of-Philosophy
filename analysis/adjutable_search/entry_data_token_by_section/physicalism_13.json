    "main_text": "The Condition Question || Circularity\n4.2 Circularity\n\nAlong with the concepts of space, time, causality, value, meaning,\ntruth and existence, the concept of the physical is one of the central\nconcepts of human thought. So it should not be surprising that any\nattempt to come to grips with what a physical property is will be\ncontroversial. The theory and object conceptions are no different:\neach has provoked a number of different questions and criticisms. In\nthe remainder of our discussion of the condition question, I will\nreview some main ones.\n\nTo begin with, one might object that both conceptions are inadequate\nbecause they are circular, i.e., both appeal to the notion of\nsomething physical (a theory or an object) to characterize a physical\nproperty. But how can you legitimately explain the notion of one sort\nof physical thing by appealing to another? \n\nHowever, the response to this is that circularity is only a problem if\nthe conceptions are interpreted as providing a reductive analysis of\nthe notion of the physical. But there is no reason why they should be\ninterpreted in that way. After all, we have many concepts that we\nunderstand without knowing how to analyze (cf. Lewis 1970). So there\nseems no reason to suppose that either the theory or object conception\nis providing anything else but a way of understanding the notion of\nthe physical.\n\nThe point here is an important one in the context of the condition\nquestion. Earlier we said that the condition question was perfectly\nlegitimate because it is legitimate to ask what the condition of being\nphysical is that, according to physicalism, everything has. But this\nlegitimate question should not be interpreted as the demand for a\nreductive analysis of the notion of the physical. Consider Thales\nagain: it is right to ask Thales what he means by \u2018water\u2019\n\u2014 and in so doing demand an understanding of the notion of water\n\u2014 but it is wrong to demand of him a conceptual analysis of\nwater.\n",
