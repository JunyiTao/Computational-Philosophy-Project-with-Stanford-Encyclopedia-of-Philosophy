Evaluative language and the nature of law\n\nThe context of the use of the word \u2018vehicle\u2019 in Garner\nv Burr requires anyone addressing the problem in the case to make\nevaluative judgments, just to decide whether the word applied to the\nchicken coop on wheels. The context of use is a criminal prohibition\nimposed for a presumably good public purpose of protecting road\nsurfaces. To determine in that context whether the word\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 extends to a chicken coop on wheels, you need to\naddress (and to resolve any tension between) the two principles\nmentioned above: that the purposes for which Parliament passed the\nstatute should be pursued, and that criminal liability should not be\nextended to conduct that has not been unequivocally prohibited.\nBecause of that context, the question of the meaning and application\nof the language of the statute cannot be answered without making\njudgments on normative questions as to how those principles are to be\nrespected. The role of evaluative considerations in the application of\nordinary descriptive terms like \u2018vehicle\u2019 raises a\nchallenge for any thorough-going scepticism about value: the challenge\nis to decide whether to adopt a thorough-going scepticism about the\nmeaning and application of descriptive language, which seems to follow\nfrom general scepticism concerning value (see Chiassoni 2019 for a\nsustained defence of such a form of scepticism, concluding that\n\u2018The province of proper and practical legal\ninterpretation\u201cthe province of judicial and juristic\ninterpretation\u201dis, properly speaking, a province without\ntruth.\u2019 (at 46)).\n\nThe effect of the use of descriptive language can depend on evaluative\nconsiderations. For philosophy of law, that dependence raises special\nproblems. If you cannot tell whether to describe an object as a\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 for the purposes of the Act without evaluative\nreasoning, then the legal effect of the Road Traffic Act does not\ndepend merely on physical facts (such as that there were wheels on the\nchicken coop) and social facts (such as that Parliament used the word\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 in the Act, or the complex social fact of the\nwhole pattern of uses that have been made of the word\n\u2018vehicle\u2019). You cannot identify the law (that is, you\ncannot tell what legal rights and duties people have) without\nevaluative reasoning. That conclusion, if it is sound, seems to have\nimportant implications for the long-running debates in theory of law\nover the relation between fact and value in law, and over relations\nbetween law and morality. The conclusion seems to contradict one of\nthe most provocative and controversial claims in the theory of\nlaw\u2014the \u2018sources thesis\u2019, which Joseph Raz has\nstated as follows:\n\nAll law is source-based. A law is source-based if its existence and\ncontent can be identified by reference to social facts alone, without\nresort to any evaluative argument. (Raz (1994), 194\u20135; see entry\n the nature of law)\n \n\nWe can only decide whether the chicken coop was a\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 for the purpose of the Road Traffic Act by\nunderstanding the Act as pursuing something that the legislature\ndecided to pursue, and by making an normative judgment as to whether\ndue respect for the goal that the legislature valued through the\nenactment, and due respect for the requirement of certainty in\ncriminal liability, support the conclusion that the chicken coop is to\nbe treated as a \u2018vehicle\u2019 in the relevant sense. So we\ncannot apply the law without resort to evaluative and normative\nreasoning.\n\nIt may seem that judges need to make such evaluative judgments only in\nborderline cases for the application of legal language\u2014and that\nthey have discretion in those cases (that is, the judge must make a\ndecision that is not determined by law). That, you might say, would\nvindicate the sources thesis. But a clear case of a vehicle counts as\na \u2018vehicle\u2019 for the purpose of the Road Traffic Act just\nbecause the evaluative considerations that justify the use of the word\n\u2018vehicle\u2019 in that context clearly support its application.\nThe sources thesis seems to be contradicted even in the clearest cases\nof the application of a law stated in descriptive language, if the\ncontent of such laws depends on how the purposes of the law ought to\nbe conceived. That form of evaluation, you may say, can only be\ncarried out by engaging in the very same form of reasoning that, in\nRaz\u2019s theory, law excludes.\n\nIt is true that, in order to decide what the sources have directed\n(and thereby, in Raz\u2019s terms, to identify the existence and\ncontent of a law), you need to understand the sense in which a word\nlike \u2018vehicle\u2019 is used. But the existence and content of\nthe offence can still be identified without first judging whether it\nought to be an offence to do what Mr.Burr did, or whether there ought\nto be any offence at all of driving without pneumatic tires. The\nsources thesis articulates this important insight: in English law,\nthere was no offence of driving without pneumatic tires (whether or\nnot it would be a good idea for that to be an offence), until\nParliament acted to create the offence. And then, it became an offence\nbecause of the fact that Parliament had done so (whether or not it was\na good idea to do so). Moreover, if the institutions of the law had\nnot been prepared to treat the chicken coop as a vehicle, then because\nof that social fact, it would have been false (after a decision with\nprecedential effect) to say that it was an offence to pull a chicken\ncoop on iron wheels on the road. Law is reflexive in the sense that\nthe law gives legal authority to legal institutions to identify the\nlaw. Therefore, the courts\u2019 decisions determine legal rights and\nobligations. So, we might say, a law is source-based if its existence\nand content can be identified by reference to social facts alone,\nwithout resort to any evaluative argument, other than whatever\nevaluative argument may be needed to determine the social facts, or to\nwork out their implications for the case at hand.\n\nRaz\u2019s explanation of the nature of law is not undermined by the\nfact that evaluative judgments are necessary in order to identify the\nimplications of the social fact that Parliament prohibited vehicles\nfrom being driven without pneumatic tires. It is still possible for\nlegal directives to have the exclusionary force that, in his theory of\nauthority, they claim (Raz 2009, chapters 1 and 2). The court in\nGarner v Burr can decide whether it is an offence to pull a\nchicken coop on wheels without pneumatic tires, without answering the\nquestion, \u2018should it be an offence to pull a chicken coop down a\nroad on iron wheels?\u2019, or the question, \u2018should it be an\noffence to use a vehicle without pneumatic tires?\u2019 But the court\nneeds to ask the related question: \u2018what is the relevant sense\nof \u201cvehicle\u201d for the purposes of this Act?\u2019 It is\nwhat Parliament did that determines Lawrence Burr\u2019s liability;\nit may take evaluative reasoning to answer the question of social\nfact, \u2018what did Parliament prohibit, when it prohibited vehicles\nfrom being driven without pneumatic tires?\u2019\n",
