    "main_text": "Payment || Payment and the Welfare of the Child\n4.2 Payment and the Welfare of the Child\n\nWe turn now to some of the more \u2018distinctive\u2019 issues\nrelating to paying gamete donors. The first of these is the welfare of\nthe child created. While this issue is \u2018distinctive\u2019\ninasmuch as it applies only in the reproductive sphere (and so not to,\nfor example, organ sale) it does arise in other reproductive areas,\nnotably commercial surrogacy (Harris 2000).\n\nThe main worry here is that when donor-conceived children find out\nthat money is what primarily motivated the donor then, in some cases,\nthis will have adverse psychological effects; in the most extreme case,\nthey may come to feel that they were \u2018bought\u2019 (HFEA 2011).\nWhat follows from this possibility, however, is unclear.\n\nTo start with, there are empirical questions about how many\ndonor-conceived people will feel this way and about how severe their\nnegative feelings (if any) are. Not all donor-conceived people have\nnegative feelings about donor motives and financial reward; some may\nnot care what their donors\u2019 motives were. So, if this concern is\ngoing to ground an ethical argument against paying donors, a solid\nevidence base will be needed to underpin its empirical premises.\n\nSimilarly, there is a set of questions not so much about what donors\u2019\nactual motives are, but about what they write on their\ndonation papers, and about how and when information is conveyed to\ntheir offspring. One view is that, for the sake of the welfare of the\nchild, it would be better for donors to \u2018tell a story\u2019\n(even if not wholly accurate) that donor-conceived children will find\nmore palatable than the bare truth that the donor simply needed money.\nAnother is that if donor-conceived children are communicated with\nappropriately, honestly, and sensitively, and at an early stage then\nany problems associated with donor motives will be minimal (Nuffield\nCouncil on Bioethics 2013).\n\nStill, let\u2019s allow (at least for the sake of argument) that\nthese problems are insurmountable: that\u2014whatever we do\u2014a\nsignificant number of donor-conceived children will be substantially\nharmed by the knowledge that their donors were paid. What follows from\nthis?\n\nFirst, we should note that this area is subject to the implications of\nthe Non-Identity Problem (Parfit 1984). In particular, given that\n(let\u2019s assume) many paid sperm donors would not have donated\nbut for the money, it is plausible to supposed that children who\nsuffer psychological harm when they find out about their donors\nwould not have existed if there hadn\u2019t been payments.\nTherefore, for standard reasons relating to the Non-identity Problem,\nthey may not be harmed by the practice of payment\u2014or at\nleast not in the usual comparative harm-to-interests sense (worse off\nthan they would otherwise have been). (See the entry on the\n non-identity problem.)\n So, while there may still be a child welfare argument against\npayment, it must rely not on harm-avoidance but rather on impersonal\nwelfare considerations.\n\nGiven this, a lot hinges on whether payment is required to ensure an\nadequate supply of donor gametes. If it is not (if, for example, the\nreasons for paying people are quite trivial ones, such as\nadministrative convenience, or even allowing recipients more choice)\nthen the fact that payment will adversely affect the welfare of donor-conceived children does\nlooks like a good (albeit prima facie) reason to prefer\naltruistic donation. Imagine that we have a choice between creating a\npopulation of donor-conceived children using paid donors or a\ndifferent but equally large population using altruistic donors. If (as\nwe\u2019re allowing) the latter will have a higher quality of life\nthen there is a strong \u2018impersonal\u2019 reason, other things\nbeing equal, to prefer the latter: altruistic donation. Things look\nrather different though if the choice is instead between a population\nof donor-conceived children using paid donors or a different and\nsignificantly smaller population, for then it would be necessary\nto \u2018trade off\u2019 a higher average quality of life against\nboth (a) the fact that there are fewer lives overall and (b) any harm\ndone to prospective parents who are denied the opportunity to raise a\ndonor-conceived child. Any such moral calculation will be complex and\nthis goes to show that, in cases where payment is required to secure\nan adequate supply of gametes, this is not obviously wrong (all things\nconsidered) even if there are detrimental effects on donor-conceived\npeople\u2019s quality of life (Wilkinson 2016).\n",
