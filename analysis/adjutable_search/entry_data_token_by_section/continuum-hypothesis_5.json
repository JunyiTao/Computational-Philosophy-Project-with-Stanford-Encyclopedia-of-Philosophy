    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || \u03a9-Logic\n3.2 \u03a9-Logic\nWe will now recast the above results in terms of a strong logic. We\nshall make full use of large cardinal axioms and in this setting we\nare interested in logics that are \u201cwell-behaved\u201d in the\nsense that the question of what implies what is not radically\nindependent. For example, it is well known that CH is expressible in\nfull second-order logic. It follows that in the presence of large\ncardinals one can always use set forcing to flip the truth-value of a\npurported logical validity of full second-order logic. However, there\nare strong logics\u2014like \u03c9-logic and \u03b2-logic\u2014that\ndo not have this feature\u2014they are well-behaved in the sense that\nin the presence of large cardinal axioms the question of what implies\nwhat cannot be altered by set forcing. We shall introduce a very\nstrong logic that has this feature\u2014\u03a9-logic. In fact, the\nlogic we shall introduce can be characterized as\nthe strongest logic with this feature (see\nKoellner (2010) for further discussion of strong logics and for a\nprecise statement of this result). \n3.2.1 \u03a9-logic\n\nDefinition 3.4.  Suppose that T is a\ncountable theory in the language of set theory and \u03c6 is a\nsentence. Then\nT \u22a7\u03a9 \u03c6\n if for all complete Boolean algebras B and for all ordinals\n\u03b1, \n\nif VB\u03b1 \u22a7 T then VB\u03b1 \u22a7 \u03c6.\nWe say that a statement \u03c6 is \u03a9-satisfiable if\nthere exists an ordinal \u03b1 and a complete Boolean\nalgebra B such\nthat VB\u03b1 \u22a7 \u03c6,\nand we say that \u03c6 is \u03a9-valid if\n\u2205 \u22a7\u03a9 \u03c6. So, the above theorem says\nthat (under our background assumptions), the statement \u201c\u03c6\nis \u03a9-satisfiable\u201d is generically invariant and in terms of\n\u03a9-validity this is simply the following: \n\nTheorem 3.5\n(Woodin 1999). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that T is\na countable theory in the language of set theory and\n\u03c6 is a sentence. Then for all complete Boolean\nalgebras B, \n\nT \u22a7\u03a9 \u03c6 iff VB \u22a7 \u201cT \u22a7\u03a9 \u03c6.\u201d\nThus this logic is robust in that the question of what implies what\nis invariant under set forcing. \n3.2.2 The \u03a9 Conjecture\nCorresponding to the semantic relation \u22a7\u03a9\nthere is a quasi-syntactic proof relation\n\u22a2\u03a9. The \u201cproofs\u201d are certain robust\nsets of reals (universally Baire sets of reals) and the test\nstructures are models that are \u201cclosed\u201d under these\nproofs. The precise notions of \u201cclosure\u201d and\n\u201cproof\u201d are somewhat technical and so we will pass over\nthem in silence.[7]\n\n Like the semantic relation, this quasi-syntactic proof relation is\nrobust under large cardinal assumptions: \n\nTheorem 3.6\n(Woodin 1999). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose T is a\ncountable theory in the language of set theory, \u03c6 is a\nsentence, and B is a complete Boolean\nalgebra. Then \n\nT\n\u22a2\u03a9 \u03c6 iff VB \u22a7 \u2018T\n\u22a2\u03a9 \u03c6\u2019.\n\n Thus, we have a semantic consequence relation and a\nquasi-syntactic proof relation, both of which are robust under the\nassumption of large cardinal axioms. It is natural to ask whether the\nsoundness and completeness theorems hold for these relations. The\nsoundness theorem is known to hold: \n\nTheorem 3.7\n(Woodin 1999). Assume\nZFC. Suppose T is a countable theory in\nthe language of set theory and \u03c6 is a sentence. If\nT \u22a2\u03a9 \u03c6 then\nT \u22a7\u03a9 \u03c6. \nIt is open whether the corresponding completeness theorem\nholds. The \u03a9 Conjecture is simply the assertion that it\ndoes: \n\nConjecture 3.8\n(\u03a9 Conjecture ).  Assume ZFC\nand that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then for each\nsentence \u03c6, \n\n\u2205 \u22a7\u03a9 \u03c6 iff \u2205 \u22a2\u03a9 \u03c6.\n\n We will need a strong form of this conjecture which we shall call\nthe Strong \u03a9 Conjecture. It is somewhat technical and so we will\npass over it in silence.[8]\n\n3.2.3 \u03a9-Complete Theories\nRecall that one key virtue of large cardinal axioms is that they\n\u201ceffectively settle\u201d the theory of second-order arithmetic\n(and, in fact, the theory of L(\u211d) and more) in the sense that in\nthe presence of large cardinals one cannot use the method of set\nforcing to establish independence with respect to statements about\nL(\u211d). This notion of invariance under set forcing played a key\nrole in Section 3.1. We can now rephrase this notion in terms of\n\u03a9-logic. \n\nDefinition 3.9.  A theory T is\n\u03a9-complete for a collection of sentences \u0393 if for\neach \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393, T \u22a7\u03a9 \u03c6 or\nT \u22a7\u03a9 \u00ac\u03c6. \nThe invariance of the theory of L(\u211d) under set forcing can\nnow be rephrased as follows: \n\nTheorem 3.10\n(Woodin 1999). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then ZFC is\n\u03a9-complete for the collection of sentences of the\nform \u201cL(\u211d) \u22a7 \u03c6\u201d. \n Unfortunately, it follows from a series of results originating\nwith work of Levy and Solovay that traditional large cardinal axioms\ndo not yield \u03a9-complete theories at the level of\n\u03a321 since\none can always use a \u201csmall\u201d (and hence large cardinal\npreserving) forcing to alter the truth-value of CH. \n\nTheorem 3.11.  Assume L is a\nstandard large cardinal axiom. Then ZFC + L is not\n\u03a9-complete for\n\u03a321. \n",
