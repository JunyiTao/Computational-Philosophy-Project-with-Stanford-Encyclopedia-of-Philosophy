    "main_text": "Two More Paradoxes || The Grain of Millet\n5. Zeno\u2019s Influence on Philosophy\n\nIn this final section we should consider briefly the impact that Zeno\nhas had on various philosophers; a search of the literature will\nreveal that these debates continue. \n\nThe Pythagoreans: For the first half of the Twentieth century, the\nmajority reading\u2014following Tannery (1885)\u2014of Zeno held\nthat his arguments were directed against a technical doctrine of the\nPythagoreans. According to this reading they held that all things were\ncomposed of elements that had the properties of a unit number, a\ngeometric point and a physical atom: this kind of position would fit\nwith their doctrine that reality is fundamentally mathematical.\nHowever, in the middle of the century a series of commentators\n(Vlastos, 1967, summarizes the argument and contains references)\nforcefully argued that Zeno\u2019s target was instead a common sense\nunderstanding of plurality and motion\u2014one grounded in familiar\ngeometrical notions\u2014and indeed that the doctrine was not a major\npart of Pythagorean thought. We have implicitly assumed that these\narguments are correct in our readings of the paradoxes. That said,\nTannery\u2019s interpretation still has its defenders (see e.g.,\nMatson 2001).\nThe Atomists: Aristotle (On Generation and Corruption\n316b34) claims that our third argument\u2014the one concerning\ncomplete divisibility\u2014was what convinced the atomists that there\nmust be smallest, indivisible parts of matter. See Abraham (1972) for\na further discussion of Zeno\u2019s connection to the atomists.\nTemporal Becoming: In the early part of the Twentieth century\nseveral influential philosophers attempted to put Zeno\u2019s\narguments to work in the service of a metaphysics of \u2018temporal\nbecoming\u2019, the (supposed) process by which the present comes\ninto being. Such thinkers as Bergson (1911), James (1911, Ch\n10\u201311) and Whitehead (1929) argued that Zeno\u2019s paradoxes\nshow that space and time are not structured as a mathematical\ncontinuum: they argued that the way to preserve the reality of motion\nwas to deny that space and time are composed of points and instants.\nHowever, we have clearly seen that the tools of standard modern\nmathematics are up to the job of resolving the paradoxes, so no such\nconclusion seems warranted: if the present indeed\n\u2018becomes\u2019, there is no reason to think that the process is\nnot captured by the continuum.\nApplying the Mathematical Continuum to Physical Space and Time:\nFollowing a lead given by Russell (1929, 182\u2013198), a number of\nphilosophers\u2014most notably Gr\u00fcnbaum (1967)\u2014took up the\ntask of showing how modern mathematics could solve all of Zeno\u2019s\nparadoxes; their work has thoroughly influenced our discussion of the\narguments. What they realized was that a purely mathematical solution\nwas not sufficient: the paradoxes not only question abstract\nmathematics, but also the nature of physical reality. So what they\nsought was an argument not only that Zeno posed no threat to the\nmathematics of infinity but also that that mathematics correctly\ndescribes objects, time and space. It would not answer Zeno\u2019s\nparadoxes if the mathematical framework we invoked was not a good\ndescription of actual space, time, and motion! The idea that a\nmathematical law\u2014say Newton\u2019s law of universal\ngravity\u2014may or may not correctly describe things is familiar,\nbut some aspects of the mathematics of infinity\u2014the nature of\nthe continuum, definition of infinite sums and so on\u2014seem so\nbasic that it may be hard to see at first that they too apply\ncontingently. But surely they do: nothing guarantees a\npriori\u00a0 that space has the structure of the continuum, or\neven that parts of space add up according to Cauchy\u2019s\ndefinition. (Salmon offers a nice example to help make the point:\nsince alcohol dissolves in water, if you mix the two you end up with\nless than the sum of their volumes, showing that even ordinary\naddition is not applicable to every kind of system.) Our belief that\nthe mathematical theory of infinity describes space and time is\njustified to the extent that the laws of physics assume that it does,\nand to the extent that those laws are themselves confirmed by\nexperience. While it is true that almost all physical theories assume\nthat space and time do indeed have the structure of the continuum, it\nis also the case that quantum theories of gravity likely imply that\nthey do not. While no one really knows where this research will\nultimately lead, it is quite possible that space and time will turn\nout, at the most fundamental level, to be quite unlike the\nmathematical continuum that we have assumed here.\n\nOne should also note that Gr\u00fcnbaum took the job of showing that\nmodern mathematics describes space and time to involve something\nrather different from arguing that it is confirmed by experience. The\ndominant view at the time (though not at present) was that scientific\nterms had meaning insofar as they referred directly to objects of\nexperience\u2014such as \u20181m ruler\u2019\u2014or, if they\nreferred to \u2018theoretical\u2019 rather than\n\u2018observable\u2019 entities\u2014such as \u2018a point of\nspace\u2019 or \u20181/2 of 1/2 of \u2026 1/2 a\nracetrack\u2019\u2014then they obtained meaning by their logical\nrelations\u2014via definitions and theoretical laws\u2014to such\nobservation terms. Thus Gr\u00fcnbaum undertook an impressive program\nto give meaning to all terms involved in the modern theory of\ninfinity, interpreted as an account of space and time.\nSupertasks: A further strand of thought concerns what Black\n(1950\u201351) dubbed \u2018infinity machines\u2019. Black and his\nfollowers wished to show that although Zeno\u2019s paradoxes offered\nno problem to mathematics, they showed that after all mathematics was\nnot applicable to space, time and motion. Most starkly, our resolution\nto the Dichotomy and Achilles assumed that the complete run could be\nbroken down into an infinite series of half runs, which could be\nsummed. But is it really possible to complete any infinite series of\nactions: to complete what is known as a \u2018supertask\u2019? If\nnot, and assuming that Atalanta and Achilles can complete their tasks,\ntheir complete runs cannot be correctly described as an infinite\nseries of half-runs, although modern mathematics would so describe\nthem. What infinity machines are supposed to establish is that an\ninfinite series of tasks cannot be completed\u2014so any completable\ntask cannot be broken down into an infinity of smaller tasks, whatever\nmathematics suggests.\nInfinitesimals: Finally, we have seen how to tackle the paradoxes\nusing the resources of mathematics as developed in the Nineteenth\ncentury. For a long time it was considered one of the great virtues of\nthis system that it finally showed that infinitesimal quantities,\nsmaller than any finite number but larger than zero, are unnecessary.\n(Newton\u2019s calculus for instance effectively made use of such\nnumbers, treating them sometimes as zero and sometimes as finite; the\nproblem with such an approach is that how to treat the numbers is a\nmatter of intuition not rigor.) However, in the Twentieth century\nRobinson showed how to introduce infinitesimal numbers into\nmathematics: this is the system of \u2018non-standard analysis\u2019\n(the familiar system of real numbers, given a rigorous foundation by\nDedekind, is by contrast just \u2018analysis\u2019). Analogously,\nBell (1988) explains how infinitesimal line segments can be introduced\ninto geometry, and comments on their relation to Zeno. Moreover,\nMcLaughlin (1992, 1994) shows how Zeno\u2019s paradoxes can be\nresolved in non-standard analysis; they are no more argument against\nnon-standard analysis than against the standard mathematics we have\nassumed here. It should be emphasized however that\u2014contrary to\nMcLaughlin\u2019s suggestions\u2014there is no need for non-standard\nanalysis to solve the paradoxes: either system is equally successful.\n(Reeder, 2015, argues that non-standard analysis is unsatisfactory\nregarding the arrow, and offers an alternative account using a\ndifferent conception of infinitesimals.) The construction of\nnon-standard analysis does however raise a further question about the\napplicability of analysis to physical space and time: it seems\nplausible that all physical theories can be formulated in either\nterms, and so as far as our experience extends both seem equally\nconfirmed. But they cannot both be true of space and time: either\nspace has infinitesimal parts or it doesn\u2019t.\n\nFurther Readings\n\nAfter the relevant entries in this encyclopedia, the place to begin\nany further investigation is Salmon (2001), which contains some of the\nmost important articles on Zeno up to 1970, and an impressively\ncomprehensive bibliography of works in English in the Twentieth\nCentury. \n\nOne might also take a look at Huggett (1999, Ch. 3) and Huggett (2010,\nCh. 2\u20133) for further source passages and discussion. For\nintroductions to the mathematical ideas behind the modern resolutions,\nthe Appendix to Salmon (2001) or Stewart (2017) are good starts;\nRussell (1919) and Courant et al. (1996, Chs. 2 and 9) are\nalso both wonderful sources. Finally, three collections of original\nsources for Zeno\u2019s paradoxes: Lee (1936 [2015]) contains\neverything known, Kirk et al (1983, Ch. 9) contains a great\ndeal of material (in English and Greek) with useful commentaries, and\nCohen et al. (1995) also has the main passages.\n",
