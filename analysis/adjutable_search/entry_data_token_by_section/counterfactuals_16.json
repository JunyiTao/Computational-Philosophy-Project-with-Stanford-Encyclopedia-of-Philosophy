This can be illustrated for (45). \n\n\n(45)\n\n\na.\nIf both Switch A and Switch B are up, the light is on.\n        \\(\\mathsf{\\medsquare((A\\land B)\\supset L)}\\)\nb.\nIf either Switch A or Switch B is down, the light is off.\n        \\(\\mathsf{\\medsquare((\\neg A\\lor\\neg B)\\supset \\neg L)}\\)\nc.\nSwitch A is up, Switch B is down, and the light is off.\n        \\(\\mathsf{A\\land\\neg B\\land\\neg L}\\)\nd.\nIf Switch B had been up, the light would have been on.\n        \\(\\mathsf{B>L}\\)\n\n\n\nSentences (45a)-(45c) can be encoded by the Bayesian Network and structural equations in Figure  12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \nA = 1\\\\\nB = 0\\\\\nL = 0\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n  Figure\n12: Bayesian Network and Structural Equations for\n (45)\n  Recall that \\(L\\dequal A\\land B\\) means that the value of\nL equals the value of \\(A\\land B\\), but also asymmetrically\ndepends on the value of \\(A\\land B\\): the value of \\(A\\land B\\)\ndetermines the value of L, and not vice-versa. How, given the\nnetwork in\n Figure 12,\n does one evaluate the counterfactual \\(\\mathsf{B>N}\\)? Several\ndifferent answers have been given to this question.\n\nPearl (1995, 2000, 2009, 2013: Ch.7)\nproposes:\n\nInterventionism Evaluate \\(\\mathsf{B > L}\\)\nrelative to a Bayesian Network by removing any incoming arrows to\nB, setting its value to 1, and projecting this change forward\nthrough the remaining network. If L is 1 in the resulting\nnetwork, \\(\\mathsf{B > L}\\) is true; otherwise it\u2019s\nfalse.\n\n\nOn this approach, one simply deletes the assignment \\(B=0\\), replaces\nit with \\(B=1\\), and solves for L using the equation \\(L\\dequal\nA\\land B\\). Since the deletion of \\(B=0\\) does not effect the\nassignment \\(A=1\\), it follows that \\(L=1\\) and that the\ncounterfactual is true. This simple recipe yields the right result.\nPearl nicely sums up the difference between this kind of analysis and\na similarity analysis:\n\n\nIn contrast with Lewis\u2019s theory, counterfactuals are not based\non an abstract notion of similarity among hypothetical worlds;\ninstead, they rest directly on the mechanisms (or \u201claws,\u201d\nto be fancy) that produce those worlds and on the invariant properties\nof those mechanisms. Lewis\u2019s elusive \u201cmiracles\u201d are\nreplaced by principled [interventions] which represent the minimal\nchange (to a model) necessary for establishing the antecedent\u2026\nThus, similarities and priorities\u2014if they are ever\nneeded\u2014may be read into the [interventions] as an\nafterthought\u2026 but they are not basic to the analysis. (Pearl\n2009: 239\u2013240)\n\n\nAs interventionism is stated above, it does not apply to conditionals\nwith logically complex antecedents or consequents. This limitation is\naddressed by Briggs (2012), who also\naxiomatizes and compares the resultant logic to D.\nLewis (1973b) and Stalnaker\n(1968)\u2014significantly extending\nthe analysis and results in Pearl (2009:\nCh.7). Integrations of causal models with premise semantics\n(Schulz 2007, 2011; Kaufmann 2013; Santorio\n2014; Champollion, Ciardelli, & Zhang 2016; Ciardelli, Zhang,\n& Champollion forthcoming) provide another way of\nincorporating an interventionist analysis into a fully compositional\nsemantics. However, interventionism does face other limitations.\n\nHiddleston (2005) presents the following\nexample.\n\n\n(48)\n\n\na.\nIf the cannon is lit, there is a simultaneous flash and bang.\nb.\nThe cannon was not lit, there was no flash, and no bang.\nc.\nBut, if there had been a flash, there would have been a bang.\n\n\n\n\n(48c)\n is intuitively true in this context. The network for\n (48)\n is given in\n Figure 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \nL = 0\\\\\nF = 0\\\\\nB = 0\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Bayesian Network and\nStructural Equations for\n (48)\n\n\n\nHiddleston (2005) observes that\ninterventionism does not predict \\(\\mathsf{F>B}\\) to be true. It\ntells one to delete the arrow going in to F, set its value to\n1, and project the consequences of doing so. However, none of the\nother values depend on F so they keep their actual values:\n\\(L=0\\) and \\(B=0\\). Accordingly, \\(\\mathsf{F>B}\\) is false,\ncontrary to intuition. Further, because the intervention on F\nhas destroyed its connection to B, it\u2019s not even possible\nto tweak interventionism to allow values to flow backwards (to the\nleft) through the\n network.[43]\n Hiddleston\u2019s (2005)\ncounterexample highlights the possibility of another kind of\ncounterexample featuring embedded conditionals. Consider again the\nnetwork in\n Figure 12.\n The following counterfactual seems true (Starr\n2012: 13).\n\n\n(49)\nIf the light had been on, then if you had flipped Switch A down, the light would be off.\n\n\nAnd, considering a simple match, Fisher (2017b:\n\u00a71) observes that\n (50b)\n is intuitively false.\n\n\n(50)\n\n\na.\nA match is struck but does not light.\nb.\nIf the match had lit, then (even) if it had not been struck, it would have lit.\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, interventionism is destined to make the wrong\nprediction. With\n (49),\n the intervention in the first antecedent removes the connection\nbetween Switch A and the light, so when the antecedent of the\nconsequent is made true by intervention, it does not result in\nL\u2019s value becoming 0. And so the whole counterfactual\ncomes out false. Similarly with\n (50b),\n when the first antecedent is made true by intervention, it stays true\neven after the second antecedent is evaluated. Hence the whole\nconditional is predicted to be true. Fisher\n(2017a) also observes that interventionism also has no way of\ntreating counterlegal counterfactuals like if Switch A had alone\ncontrolled the light, the light would be on.\n\nThese counterexamples to interventionism have stimulated alternative\naccounts like Hiddleston\u2019s (2005)\nminimal network analysis and further developments of that\nanalysis (Rips 2010; Rips & Edwards 2013;\nFisher 2017b). Instead of modifying an existing network to make\nthe antecedent true, this analysis considers alternate networks where\nonly the parent nodes of the antecedent which directly influence it\nare changed to make the antecedent come true. However, Pearl\u2019s\n(2009) interventionist analysis has also\nbeen incorporated into the extended structural models\nanalysis (Lucas & Kemp 2015). This\nanalysis aims to capture interventions as a special case of a more\ngeneral proposal about how antecedents are made true. One important\naspect of this proposal is that interventions often involve inserting\na hidden node that amounts to an unknown cause of the antecedent. The\nanalysis of Snider and Bjorndahl (2015)\npursues a third idea: counterfactuals are not interpreted by\nmanipulating a background network, but instead serve to constrain the\nclass of possible networks compatible with the information shared in a\nconversation, as in Stalnaker\u2019s (1978)\ntheory of\n assertion.[44]\n Among these relations can be cause-to-effect networks as in\n (45d),\n but also networks that involve the antecedent and consequent having a\ncommon cause, as in\n (48c).\n As should be clear, this is a rapidly developing area of research\nwhere it is not possible to identify one analysis as standard or\nrepresentative. It does bear emphasizing that this literature is\ndriven not only by precise formal models, but also by experimental\ndata which is brought to bear on the predictions of these\nanalyses.\n\nA few final philosophical remarks are in order about the kinds of\nanalyses discussed here. If one follows Woodward\n(2002) and Hitchcock\n(2001) in their interpretation of\nthese networks, a structural equation should be viewed as a primitive\ncounterfactual. It follows that this is a non-reductive analysis of\ncounterfactual dependence: it only explains how the truth of\narbitrarily complex counterfactual sentences are grounded in basic\nrelations of counterfactual dependence. However, note in the earlier\nquotation above from Pearl (2009:\n239\u2013240) that he interprets structural equations as basic\nmechanisms or laws, and so arguably counts as an analysis of\ncounterfactuals in terms of laws. These amount to two very different\nphilosophical positions that interact with the philosophical debates\n surveyed in\n \u00a71.3.\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that while many working in this framework\napply these networks to causal relations, there is no reason to assume\nthat the analysis would not apply to other kinds of dependence\nrelations. For example, constitutional dependence is at the heart of\ncounterfactuals like: \n\n\n(51)\nIf Socrates hadn\u2019t existed, the set consisting of Socrates wouldn\u2019t have existed.\n\n\nFrom a Bayesian Network approach to mental representation\n (\u00a71.2.3),\n this makes perfect sense: the networks encode probabilistic\ndependence which can come from causal or constitutional facts.\n\nFinally, it is worth highlighting that the philosophical objections\ndirected at the similarity analysis in\n \u00a72.6\n are addressed, at least to some degree, by structural equation\nanalyses. Because the central constructs of this\nanalysis\u2014structural equations and Bayesian Networks\u2014are\nalso employed in models of mental representation, causation, and\nscientific explanation, it grounds counterfactuals in a construct\nalready taken to explain how creatures like us cope with a world like\nthe one we live in.\n",
