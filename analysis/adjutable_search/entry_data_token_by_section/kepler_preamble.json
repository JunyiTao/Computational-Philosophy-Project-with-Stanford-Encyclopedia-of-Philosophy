    "main_text": "\n\nJohannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) is one of the most significant\nrepresentatives of the so-called Scientific Revolution of the\n16th and 17th centuries. Although he received\nonly the basic training of a \u201cmagister\u201d and was\nprofessionally oriented towards theology at the beginning of his\ncareer, he rapidly became known for his mathematical skills and\ntheoretical creativity. As a convinced Copernican, Kepler was able to\ndefend the new system on different fronts: against the old astronomers\nwho still sustained the system of Ptolemy, against the Aristotelian\nnatural philosophers, against the followers of the new \u201cmixed\nsystem\u201d of Tycho Brahe\u2014whom Kepler succeeded as Imperial\nMathematician in Prague\u2014and even against the standard Copernican\nposition according to which the new system was to be considered merely\nas a computational device and not necessarily a physical reality.\nKepler\u2019s complete corpus can be hardly summarized as a\n\u201csystem\u201d of ideas like scholastic philosophy or the new\nCartesian systems which arose in the second half of the 17th century.\nNevertheless, it is possible to identify two main tendencies, one\nlinked to Platonism and giving priority to the role of geometry in the\nstructure of the world, the other connected with the Aristotelian\ntradition and accentuating the role of experience and causality in\nepistemology. While he attained immortal fame in astronomy because of\nhis three planetary laws, Kepler also made fundamental contributions\nin the fields of optics and mathematics. To the little-known facts\nregarding Kepler\u2019s indefatigable scientific activity belong his\nefforts to develop different technical devices, for instance, a water\npump, which he tried to patent and apply in different practical\ncontexts (for the documents, see KGW 21.2.2., pp. 509\u201357 and\n667\u2013691). To his contemporaries he was also a famous\nmathematician and astrologer; for his own part, he wanted to be\nconsidered a philosopher who investigated the innermost structure of\nthe cosmos scientifically.\n",
