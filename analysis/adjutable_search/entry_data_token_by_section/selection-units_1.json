    "main_text": "Four Basic Questions\n2. Four Basic Questions\n\nFour basic questions can be delineated as distinct and separable. As\nwill be demonstrated in\n section 3,\n these questions are often used in combination to represent the units\nof selection problem. But let us begin by clarifying terms (see Lloyd\n1992, 2001). (See the entry on\n the biological notion of individual\n for more on this topic.)\n\nThe term replicator, originally introduced in the 1970s but\nsince modified by philosophers in the 1980s, is used to refer to any\nentity of which copies are made (Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b; Hull 1980; Brandon\n1982). Replicators were originally described using two orthogonal\ndistinctions. A \u201cgerm-line\u201d replicator, as distinct from a\n\u201cdead-end\u201d replicator, is \u201cthe potential ancestor of\nan indefinitely long line of descendant replicators\u201d (Dawkins\n1982a: 46). For instance, DNA in a chicken\u2019s egg is a germ-line\nreplicator, whereas that in a chicken\u2019s wing is a dead-end\nreplicator. Note that DNA are, but chickens are not, replicators,\nsince the latter do not replicate themselves as wholes. An\n\u201cactive\u201d replicator is \u201ca replicator that has some\ncausal influence on its own probability of being propagated,\u201d\nwhereas a \u201cpassive\u201d replicator is never transcribed and\nhas no phenotypic expression whatsoever (Dawkins 1982a: 47). There is\nspecial interest in active germ-line replicators,\n\u201csince adaptations \u2018for\u2019 their preservation are\nexpected to fill the world and to characterize living organisms\u201d\n(Dawkins 1982a: 47).\n\nThe original terminology of \u201creplicator\u201d was introduced\nalong with the term \u201cvehicle\u201d, which is defined as \n\n\nany relatively discrete entity\u2026which houses replicators, and\nwhich can be regarded as a machine programmed to preserve and\npropagate the replicators that ride inside it. (Dawkins 1982b: 295)\n\n\n\nOn this view, most replicators\u2019 phenotypic effects are\nrepresented in vehicles, which are themselves the proximate targets of\nnatural selection (Dawkins 1982a: 62).\n\nIn the introduction of the term \u201cinteractor\u201d, it was\nobserved that the previous theory has replicators interacting with\ntheir environments in two distinct ways: they produce copies of\nthemselves, and they influence their own survival and the survival of\ntheir copies through the production of secondary products that\nultimately have phenotypic expression (Hull 1980). The term\n\u201cinteractor\u201d was suggested for the entities that function\nin this second process. An interactor denotes that entity which\ninteracts, as a cohesive whole, directly with its environment in such\na way that replication is differential\u2014in other words, an entity\non which selection acts directly (Hull 1980: 318). The process of\nevolution by natural selection is \n\n\na process in which the differential extinction and proliferation of\ninteractors cause the differential perpetuation of the replicators\nthat produced them. (Hull 1980: 318; see Brandon 1982: 317\u2013318)\n\n\n\nOne challenge to the term, \u201cinteractor,\u201d was that\n\u201cinteracting is not conspicuous during the process of\nelimination that results in natural selection\u201d (Mayr 1997:\n2093). It\u2019s difficult to imagine why anyone would say this,\ngiven the original description of the interactor as \u201can entity\nthat directly interacts \u2026 in such a way that replication is\ndifferential\u201d. Perhaps more interestingly, the\n\u201ctarget of selection\u201d language is rejected because\nselection is seen as more of an elimination process; thus, it would be\nmisleading to call the \u201cleftovers\u201d of the elimination\nprocess the \u201ctargets\u201d of selection. The term\n\u201cselecton\u201d, was proposed, which is defined as \n\n\na discrete entity and a cohesive whole, an individual or a social\ngroup, the survival and successful reproduction of which is favored by\nselection owing to its possession of certain properties. (Mayr 1997:\n2093) \n\n\nThis seems remarkably similar to an interactor, with the difference\nthat no differential reproduction, and thus no evolution, is\nmentioned.\n\nAt the birth of the \u201cinteractor\u201d concept, the concept of\n\u201cevolvers\u201d was also introduced, which are the entities\nthat evolve as a result of selection on interactors: these are usually\ncalled lineages (Hull 1980). So far, no one has directly\nclaimed that evolvers are units of selection. They can be seen,\nhowever, to be playing a role in considering the question of who owns\nan adaptation and who benefits from evolution by selection, which we\nwill consider in sections\n 2.3\n and\n 2.4.\n",
