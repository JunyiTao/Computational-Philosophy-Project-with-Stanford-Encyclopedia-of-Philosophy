Can quantum non-locality be reconciled with relativity?\n\n\nThe question of the compatibility of quantum mechanics with the\nspecial theory of relativity is very difficult to resolve. (The\nquestion of the compatibility of quantum mechanics with the general\ntheory of relativity is even more involved.) The answer to this\nquestion depends on the interpretation of special relativity and the\nnature of the exact constraints it imposes on influences between\nevents. \n\n\nA popular view has it that special relativity prohibits any\nsuperluminal influences, whereas theories that violate factorizability\nseem to involve such influences. Accordingly, it is held that quantum\nmechanics is incompatible with relativity. Another common view has it\nthat special relativity prohibits only certain types of superluminal\ninfluence. Many believe that relativity prohibits superluminal\nsignaling of information. Some also believe that this theory prohibits\nsuperluminal transport of matter-energy and/or\naction-at-a-distance. On the other hand, there is the view that\nrelativity per se prohibits only superluminal influences that\nare incompatible with the special-relativistic space-time, the\nso-called \u2018Minkowski space-time,\u2019 and that this\nprohibition is compatible with certain types of superluminal\ninfluences and superluminal signaling (for a comprehensive discussion\nof this issue, see Maudlin, 1994, 1996, section\n 2).[34]\n\n\n\nIt is commonly agreed that relativity requires that the descriptions\nof physical reality (i.e., the states of systems, their properties,\ndynamical laws, etc.) in different coordinate systems should be\ncompatible with each other. In particular, descriptions of the state of\nsystems in different foliations of spacetime into parallel spacelike\nhyperplanes, which correspond to different inertial reference frames,\nare to be related to each other by the Lorentz transformations. If this\nrequirement is to reflect the structure of the Minkowski spacetime,\nthese transformations must hold at the level of individual processes,\nand not only at the level of ensembles of processes (i.e., at the\nstatistical level) or observed phenomena. Indeed, Bohm's theory,\nwhich is manifestly non-relativistic, satisfies the requirement that\nthe Lorentz transformations obtain at the level of the observed\nphenomena. \n\n\nHowever, satisfying the Lorentz transformations at the level of\nindividual processes is not sufficient for compatibility with\nMinkowski spacetime; for the Lorentz transformations may also be\nsatisfied at the level of individual processes in theories that\npostulate a preferred inertial reference frame (Bell 1976). Maudlin\n(1996, section 2) suggests that a theory is genuinely relativistic\n(both in spirit and letter) if it can be formulated without ascribing\nto spacetime any more, or different intrinsic structure than the\nrelativistic\n metrics.[35]\nThe question of the compatibility of\nrelativity with quantum mechanics may be presented as follows: Could a\nquantum theory that does not encounter the measurement problem be\nrelativistic in that sense?  \n",
