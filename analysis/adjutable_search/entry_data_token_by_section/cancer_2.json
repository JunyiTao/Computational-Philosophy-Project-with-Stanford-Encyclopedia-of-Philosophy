    "main_text": "Defining and Classifying Cancer || Cancer\u2019s Variable Natural History\n1.2 Cancer\u2019s Variable Natural History\n\nA major complication surrounding classification in the case of cancer\nis that cancers have variable disease course (Foulds 1958; Cairns\n1975; Lynch 2007; Bertolaso & Dupr\u00e9 2018; Plutynski, 2018).\nNot all cancers progress uniformly to metastasis and death; some\ngrowths progress slowly or not at all. Some very common cancers (in\nthe prostate and thyroid) are either slow growing, or tend to remain\n\u201cindolent\u201d (Esserman, et al. 2014; Siegel, et al. 2017).\nThere is some disagreement in the medical community about how to\ncharacterize such cases; it\u2019s unclear whether they are best\nviewed as very slow growing precancerous lesions, or perhaps ought not\nbe characterized as cancer, at all (Schwartz, 2014). Such cases also\nraise a host of practical questions about the merits of screening, and\nthe risk of overdiagnosis\u2014the diagnosis of disease that might\nnever have progressed in the lifetime of the patient (see, e.g.,\nWalker & Rogers 2016; Hofman 2017; Esserman, et al. 2014; Welch\n& Black 2010). They also raise interesting philosophical questions\nabout the nature of disease.\n\nSome philosophers (Schwartz 2014), drawing upon the biostatistical\ntheory of disease as departure from age and sex-typical function\n(Boorse 1977), argue that we ought to classify such early-stage\ncancers as risk factors, rather than disease. Such growths are not\ndisease, on this view, because they are not atypical and do not yet\nimpair function\u2014in fact as many as one half of men over 60 have\nsome lesions of the prostate (Welch & Black 2010).\nReclassification of such cancers as mere risk factors, Schwartz\nargues, will prevent overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Other\nphilosophers (e.g., Reid 2017) argue that this approach fails to\nacknowledge how the practice of diagnosis is itself a sort of\nrisk-benefit calculation, informed in part by our knowledge of the\nprevalence of early-stage or indolent disease, and in part by more or\nless precautionary values. It seems this debate is not only a\nscientific one, but also a normative one; much like debates about PTSD\nor obesity, there are normative dimensions to how we diagnose and\nclassify disease. Labeling can have both positive and negative\nconsequences for patients, clinicians, insurers, not to mention\ndevelopers and producers of screening, medical device, and\npharmaceuticals (Ereshefsky 2009). Overdiagnosis of early-stage\ndisease can lead to serious harms; treating a condition that may or\nmay not progress to invasive disease in the lifetime of a patient is\ncostly and harmful.\n\nOne hope driving the precision medicine research program is that the\nidentification of biomarkers of aggressive disease will resolve these\nambiguities with respect to early stage disease, as well as identify\ntargets of effective treatment (see, e.g., Collins, et al. 2005).\nHowever, as we have seen, interpreting genomic data has been far from\nstraightforward, and classifying cancer types and subtypes by appeal\nto genomic information alone can lead to a loss of important\ninformation. While genomic and molecular data is no doubt useful, it\nis not necessarily decisive. \n\nIn sum, much like genes and species, diseases like cancer lack\nessences, are heterogeneous, blur together at the edges, are caused in\nmany different ways, and have variable dynamics. Perhaps inconsistent\nclassifications are simply to be expected in such cases. That this is\nso does not (necessarily) show that we ought to give up on realism\nabout disease kinds; indeed, perhaps we ought to endorse\n\u201cpromiscuous realism\u201d (Dupr\u00e9 1995). As knowledge\nhas grown, and practical interests shift, classifications can multiply\nand even cross-classify the same kinds. This is nothing to fear, so\nlong as the kinds we countenance do the predictive or explanatory work\nintended for them, in the context intended. Others have a somewhat\nless permissive view, however, though there remains a good deal of\ndispute over how and which empirical constraints should govern\nclassification of \u201cscientific kinds,\u201d whether or not these\ncategories count as examples of \u201cnatural\u201d kinds (Slater\n2014; Ereshefsky & Reydon 2015). (See the entry on\n scientific pluralism.)\n\nGiven the complex causal pathways and heterogeneity of cancer, perhaps\nit is not surprising that, as Bertolaso (2016) argues, the history of\nattempts to define cancer have floundered. Either cancer is defined so\nvaguely as to include non-pathological states, or so narrowly as to\nrule out cases that might otherwise be included. Among the many\ndefinitions she canvases are: \u201cabnormal proliferation,\u201d\n\u201cunregulated growth,\u201d \u201ca disease of cell\ndifferentiation rather than multiplication,\u201d \u201cthe result\nof destruction of tissue architecture,\u201d \u201ca systems biology\ndisease,\u201d \u201cblocked ontogeny,\u201d a disease of\n\u201csuppressed (sic) immune function,\u201d a\n\u201cmetabolic\u201d and \u201cgenomic\u201d disease. Such a\nvariety of definitions is due to the fact that cancer has many causes,\nand involves many different types of dysregulation, at a variety of\ntemporal and spatial scales. Suffice it to say, it is no small\nchallenge to identify defining features of cancer, let alone arriving\nat a unified \u201ctheory\u201d of disease etiology.\n\nOne might well ask, however, whether the lack of a unified theory of\ncancer is a cause for concern. Is this a sign of immature science?\nKincaid has argued to the contrary (2008), \u201cbiomedical science\ncan make significant progress without precise definitions of disease,\nwithout full-fledged theories of disease and of normal biological\nfunctioning, and without disease entities being natural kinds\u201d\n(p. 368). Kincaid argues that \u201cThere is no clear definition of\nwhat constitutes a cancerous cell in terms of necessary and sufficient\nconditions. However, no one thinks that cancer research should stop\nuntil we get this definition settled, or that creating linguistic\nuniformity is important for understanding the science. The science\ncertainly makes progress nonetheless\u2026 Likewise, there is no\nparsimonious theory of the disease and the normal functioning from\nwhich it is a deviation. Instead, we have piecemeal causal\nexplanations\u201d (p. 373). Kincaid is correct. Arguably, given the\ncontext-dependence or local constraints on cancer causation, (and\nperhaps also, diseases more generally) piecemeal reductive\nexplanations are often the best we can do (Schaffner, 2006).\n\nThe question of what function such a unified theory might serve is a\nmatter of some debate. A particular source of contention surrounds the\nmerits of the research program unified by a search for genetic\nmechanisms associated with cancer cell behavior (Strauss, et. al.,\n2021). This research program has received many different names: the\n\u201concogene paradigm,\u201d (Bishop 1995; Morange 1997)\n\u201cvision,\u201d (Morange 1997), \u201ctheory,\u201d or\n\u201cparadigm,\u201d (Sonnenschein & Soto 2008; Soto and\nSonnenschein, 2004, 2005), \u201cmodel\u201d (Temin 1974; Vogelstein\n& Kinzler 1993), \u201ctheory-method package\u201d (Fujimura\n1987, 1992), and \u201cframework\u201d (Blasimme, et al. 2013). Some\ncontend that focus on genetic mechanisms is a \u201cfailed\u201d\nparadigm, or a \u201cdegenerating\u201d (as opposed to\n\u201cprogressive\u201d) research program. Resolving such debates\nseems to require first that we have some measure of progress \u2013\nhardly a straightforward matter, given the variety of goals of a\nscientific research program, and their transformations, over time.\nWhile some see the central goal of research as the generation of true\ntheories, others focus on the generation of novel experimental\ntraditions, the generation of fruitful lines of inquiry, the\ngeneration of local (as opposed to general) explanations of particular\npatterns or processes, or useful ways of classifying data. A more\nmodest way of framing the question surrounding the\n\u201concogene\u201d paradigm\u2019s failure or success might be to\nfocus on how commitment to this \u201cexplanatory framework\u201d\nhas been useful in some ways, less so in others. \n\nFor instance, Blasimme, et al. (2013) characterize the search for\noncogenes as an \u201cexplanatory framework\u201d: \u201ccausal\npatterns, schemata (in the sense of Darden 2002), intuitions,\nhypotheses, evidential standards and various bits of evidence and data\ncoming from different experimental settings and instrumental\ndevices,\u201d which \u201cestablish selective and local criteria of\ncausal relevance that drive the search for, characterization and use\nof biological mechanisms.\u201d Rather than consisting of sets of\nlaws or general principles, such frameworks help generate strategies\nin the search for causes, and narrow the field of inquiry. Blassime,\net al. argue that \u201cexplanatory frameworks allow for changes of\nscientific perspective on the causal relevance of mechanisms without\nnecessarily fully replacing previous explanatory frameworks\u201d (p.\n375). Explanatory frameworks, in other words, can\n\u201ccoexist\u201d or be \u201cgradually displaced,\u201d rather\nthan stand in mutually exclusive relations with one another. As new\nquestions arose, and new information was discovered, this explanatory\nframework became elaborated. Depending upon how permissive or\nrestrictive our characterization of this framework, it need not be\nviewed as at odds with, for instance, attention to other causal\nfactors in cancer, as discussed below.\n",
