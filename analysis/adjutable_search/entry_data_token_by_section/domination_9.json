    "main_text": "What Kind of Power Is Domination? || Non-Moralized, Norm-Dependent Theories\n4.3 Non-Moralized, Norm-Dependent Theories\n\nWhen we take a hard look at the most obvious cases of\ndomination\u2014masters, tyrants, patriarchs\u2014we\u2019ll\nprobably notice that they all claim authority. The Paradigms all\ntypically think of themselves as the ones who make the rules, and that\ntheir subjects have an obligation to comply. To say that dominators,\nas such, always claim this kind of authority is to endorse a\nnorm-dependent theory: that A dominates B by virtue of\nhaving a kind of socially legitimate power over them. Not all social\npower operates in this way\u2014or doesn\u2019t seem to. The\nneighborhood mob boss who comes by your shop demanding protection\nmoney almost certainly does not expect you to think of his command,\n\u201cPay up or else!\u201d, as an expression of legitimate\nauthority backed by sanctions. Plausibly, the typical mob boss cares\nonly that you recognize him as a source of credible threats and\ncomply. According to most norm-dependent theories, this means that the\nmob boss does not dominate. Domination is always power \u201cunder\ncolor of right\u201d. The mob boss acts under no such colors. The\npatriarch, by contrast, believes that his commands create obligations\nfor those within his household; and this - not merely his power to\ninterfere with choice\u2014is why he dominates. Here, norm-dependent\ntheories part company from their norm-independent competitors: the\nlatter will tend to see both the mob boss and the patriarch as sources\nof domination.\n\nAs canvassed above, norm-dependence and moralization are separate\nissues. We don\u2019t need a theory of the right or the good to tell\nus whether someone has power legitimized by local social norms or\nlaws. Of course, we do need a moral theory to tell us if\nsocial norms or laws are right or just or truly legitimate. As we will\nsee in the next section, the most influential norm-dependent theories\nof domination tie it to a specific failure to respect the\nactual moral authority of the dominated, and so offer a\nmoralized as well as norm-dependent theory.\n\nWhy prefer norm-dependence to norm-independence? Often, the move to\nnorm-dependence is motivated by familiar worries about\nover-generalization. The world may be full of uncontrolled powers of\nchoice interference, but it is less common for one agent to regard\nsomeone else as a source of binding norms. I may have an uncontrolled\npower to interfere with your choices whenever I can take the last seat\nin a caf\u00e9 before you can get to it; this obviously has nothing\nto do with any kind of authority over you. The latter power seems less\nubiquitous and more serious.\n\nAlso, norm-dependent, non-moralized conceptions are perhaps best\nequipped to diagnose domination where the dominated have internalized\njustifications for their status. Neorepublicans often highlight how\nvictims of domination don\u2019t have enough power to contest their\nposition, but what about cases where victims of domination are\nunwilling to contest because they accept a worldview that\njustifies their domination? Michael Thompson calls such unwillingness\na manifestation of constitutive domination: the way \n\n\nnorms, institutions, and values of the community shape the rationality\nof subjects to accept forms of power and social relations and\ncollective goals as legitimate forms of authority. (2018: 44) \n\n\nIn so doing, he resists standard neorepublican talk of\n\u201carbitrary\u201d power. Domination is constitutive just because\nit is not regarded as arbitrary by those under its sway.\nInstead, he claims, domination is the expression of widely\nrationalized and internalized norms. Certainly, if we agree that all\npower necessarily involves legitimacy claims (see Azmanova 2012:\n49\u201350), it makes sense to think that intense varieties of social\npower, like domination, will go hand-in-hand with thoroughgoing\nacceptance of legitimacy claims.\n\nAccording to Marxist and Marxist-inflected theories like\nThompson\u2019s, neorepublicans are misled by their paradigms.\nNeorepublicans get their touchstones of domination from slavery and\ntraditional despotism\u2014varieties supposedly more prevalent in\npre-modern societies, where the threat of violence was the primary\ncurrency of domination. Instead, according to Marxist theories, we\nshould see domination in the ideologies that make violence and\ncoercion less necessary: for example, when the redistribution of pubic\ngoods to private elites is widely accepted as natural or as the result\nof free exchange, even by many who suffer as a result.\n\nThe internalization by the dominated of norms supposedly\nlegitimizing their domination is not the only way to connect\ndomination to internalized norms. Christopher Lebron points to another\npossibility: perhaps what is necessary isn\u2019t that the dominated\naccept a rationalization of their condition, but that the\ndominators do so. The difference between domination and more\nbenign hierarchies, he claims, is that dominators control\n\u201clegitimizing myths\u201d that hide their domination. The\nsimple fact that a worker has a boss does not indicate domination; it\nmay instead indicate only a mutually beneficial arrangement (Lebron\n2013: 56). A boss comes to dominate by accepting and promoting myths\nthat justify their ascendance. What matters, on this account, is that\nthe dominating group imbibe such myths, that their\nconsciousness is shaped, e.g., so that their power is mistaken for a\nfeature of nature, or a result of their innate merits or just deserts,\nnot that the dominated manifest a consciousness so altered. \n\nThe norm-dependent theories encountered so far look to institutions\nand systems to embody and promote social norms. Regardless of whether\ninstitutions and systems themselves dominate, standard\nnorm-dependent theories tend to see the existence of institutions as a\nnecessary condition for domination through norms: e.g., the\npatriarch\u2019s power to project authority in his family depends on\nwidely accepted attitudes about the place of fathers in the\ninstitution of the family; the slave master\u2019s power to project\nauthority to his slaves depends on an economic and political system\npermitting property in human lives. Gwilym David Blunt\u2019s theory stands\napart by being norm-dependent without requiring background\ninstitutions. According to Blunt, even the mob boss has power over\nnorms: in the language introduced above, this is an\ninteractional site of domination drawn from a\npersonal source: i.e., power between agents drawn from the\nmob boss\u2019 personal control of guns and muscle. Unlike\nnorm-independent theorists such as Lovett, Blunt claims that\nall social relationships involve norms. Insofar as the mob\nboss and the shop owner are socially related, this involves more than\nnon-normative elements like strategic relatedness or exit costs. The\nasymmetry of power that matters is an asymmetry in the power to define\nthe status of other parties in a social relationship. The mob boss has\npower enough to assign the shop owner an inferior place in their\nsocial relationships, and set up himself as the one who makes the\nrules in the relationship. In this way, Blunt believes he can preserve\nthe standard neorepublican intuition that powerful agents like the mob\nboss can be dominators within a norm-dependent framework.\n",
