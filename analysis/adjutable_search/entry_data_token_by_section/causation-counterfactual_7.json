    "main_text": "The Structural Equations Framework || SEF: The Basic Picture\n5.1 SEF: The Basic Picture\n\nThe structural equations framework describes the causal structure of a\nsystem in terms of a causal model of the system, which is identified\nas an ordered pair <V, E>, where V is a set\nof variables and E a set of structural equations stating\ndeterministic relations among the variables. (We shall confine our\nattention to deterministic systems here; see \u00a75.4 for a brief\ndiscussion of chancy causation.) The variables in V describe\nthe different possible states of the system in question. While they\ncan take any number of values, in the simple examples to be considered\nhere the variables are binary variables that take the value 1 if some\nevent occurs and the value 0 if the event does not occur. For example,\nlet us formulate a causal model to describe the system exemplified in\nthe example of late preemption to do with Billy and Suzy\u2019s rock\nthrowing. We might describe the system using the following set of\nvariables:\n\nBT = 1 if Billy throws a rock, 0 otherwise;\nST = 1 if Suzy throws a rock, 0 otherwise;\nBH = 1 if Billy\u2019s rock hits the bottle, 0\notherwise;\nSH = 1 if Suzy\u2019s rock hits the bottle, 0\notherwise;\nBS = 1 if the bottle shatters, 0 otherwise.\n\n\nHere the variables are binary. But a different model might have used\nmany-valued variables to represent the different ways in which Billy\nand Suzy threw their rocks, their rocks hit the bottle, or the bottle\nshattered.\n\nThe structural equations in a model specify which variables are to be held\nfixed at their actual values and how the values of other variables\ndepend on one another. There is a structural equation for each\nvariable. The form taken by a structural equation for a variable\ndepends on which kind of variable it is. The structural equation for\nan exogenous variable (the values of which are determined by\nfactors outside of the model) takes the form of Z = z,\nwhich simply states the actual value of the variable. The structural\nequation for an endogenous variable (the values of which are\ndetermined by factors within the model) states how the value of the\nvariable is determined by the values of the other variables. It takes\nthe form:\n\nY = f(X1,\u2026,\nXn)\n\n\nWhat does this structural equation mean? There are in fact competing\ninterpretations. Pearl (2000) regards the structural equations as the\nconceptual primitives of his framework, describing them as\nrepresenting \u2018the basic mechanisms\u2019 of the system under\ninvestigation. However, for the purposes of exposition, it is more\nconvenient to follow the interpretation of Woodward (2003) and\nHitchcock (2001), who think of the structural equations as expressing\ncertain basic counterfactuals of the following form:\n\nIf it were the case that X1 = x1,\nX2 = x2,\u2026,\nXn = xn, then it\nwould be the case that Y =\nf(x1,\u2026,xn).\n\n\nAs this form of counterfactual suggests, the structural equations are\nto be read from right to left: the antecedent of the counterfactual\nstates possible values of the variables X1 through\nto Xn and the consequent states the\ncorresponding value of the endogenous variable Y. There is a\ncounterfactual of this kind for every combination of possible values\nof the variables X1 through to\nXn. It is important to note that a structural\nequation of this kind is therefore not, strictly speaking, an identity\nsince there is a right-to-left asymmetry built into it. This asymmetry\ncorresponds to the asymmetry of non-backtracking counterfactuals. For\nexample, supposing that the actual situation is one in which neither\nSuzy nor Billy throws a rock so the bottle does not shatter, the\nnon-backtracking counterfactual \u201cIf either Suzy or Billy had\nthrown a rock, the bottle would have shattered\u201d is true. But the\ncounterfactual \u201cIf the bottle had shattered, either Suzy or\nBilly would have thrown a rock\u201d is false. \n\nAs an illustration, consider the set of structural equations that\nmight be used to model the late preemption example of Billy and Suzy.\nGiven the set of variables V listed above, the members of the\nset of the structural equations E might be stated as\nfollows:\n\nST = 1;\nBT = 1;\nSH = ST;\nBH = BT & ~SH;\nBS = SH v BH.\n\n\nIn these equations logical symbols are used to represent mathematical\nfunctions on binary variables: ~X = 1 \u2212 X;\nX v Y = max{X, Y}; X & Y\n= min{X, Y}. The first two equations simply state the\nactual values of the exogenous variables ST and BT. The\nthird equation encodes two counterfactuals, one for each possible\nvalue of ST. It states that if Suzy had thrown a rock (which in\nfact she did), her rock would have hit the bottle; and if she\nhadn\u2019t thrown a rock, it wouldn\u2019t have hit the bottle. The\nfourth equation encodes four counterfactuals, one for each possible\ncombination of values for BT and ~SH. It states that if\nBilly had thrown a rock and Suzy\u2019s rock hadn\u2019t hit the\nbottle, Billy\u2019s rock would have hit the bottle, but it\nwouldn\u2019t have done so if one or more of these conditions had not\nbeen met. The fifth equation also encodes four counterfactuals, one\nfor each possible combination of values for SH and BH.\nIt states that if one or other (or possibly both) of Suzy\u2019s rock\nor Billy\u2019s rock had hit the bottle, the bottle would have\nshattered; but if neither rock had hit the bottle, the bottle\nwouldn\u2019t have shattered.\n\nThe structural equations above can be represented in terms of a\ndirected graph. The variables in the set V are represented\nas nodes in the graph. An arrow directed from one node X to\nanother Y represents the fact that the variable X\nappears on the right-hand side of the structural equation for\nY. In this case, X is said to be a parent of\nY. Exogenous variables are represented by nodes that have no\narrows directed towards them. A directed path from X to\nY in a graph is a sequence of arrows that connect X with\nY. The directed graph of the model described above of Billy and\nSuzy example is depicted in Figure 1 below:\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThe arrows in this figure tell us that the bottle\u2019s shattering\nis a function of Suzy\u2019s rock hitting the bottle and\nBilly\u2019s rock hitting the bottle; that Billy\u2019s rock hitting\nthe bottle is a function of Billy\u2019s throwing a rock and\nSuzy\u2019s rock hitting the bottle; and that Suzy\u2019s rock\nhitting the bottle is a function of her throwing the rock. It\u2019s\nimportant to note that the nodes in the graph represent variables and\nnot \u2013 as in the case of \u2018neuron diagrams\u2019, such as\nthose found in Lewis 1986c \u2013 values of variables. Note also that\nwhile the arrows tell us that there are counterfactual dependence\nrelations between the values of the variables \u2013 all of the\npossible values, not just the actual ones \u2013 they don\u2019t\ntells us what those dependence relations are; for that, you have to\nlook at the structural equations. For example, the directed graph only\ntells us that the value of BH counterfactually depends somehow\nor other on the values of BT and SH; e.g. it\ndoesn\u2019t tell us that if Billy had thrown and Suzy\u2019s rock\nhadn\u2019t hit, Billy\u2019s rock would have hit.)\n\nAs we have seen, the structural equations directly encode some\ncounterfactuals. However, some counterfactuals that are not directly\nencoded can be derived from them. Consider, for example, the\ncounterfactual \u201cIf Suzy\u2019s rock had not hit the bottle, it\nwould still have shattered\u201d. As a matter of fact, Suzy\u2019s\nrock did hit the bottle. But we can determine what would have happened\nif it hadn\u2019t done so, by replacing the structural equation for\nthe endogenous variable SH with the equation SH = 0,\nkeeping all the other equations unchanged. So, instead of having its\nvalue determined in the ordinary way by the variable ST, the\nvalue of SH is set \u2018miraculously\u2019. Pearl describes\nthis as a \u2018surgical intervention\u2019 that changes the value\nof the variable. In terms of its graphical representation, this\namounts to wiping out the arrow from the variable ST to the\nvariable SH and treating SH as if it were an exogenous\nvariable. After this operation, the value of the variable BS\ncan be computed and shown to be equal to 1: given that Billy had\nthrown his rock, his rock would have hit the bottle and shattered it.\nSo this particular counterfactual is true. This procedure for\nevaluating counterfactuals has direct affinities with Lewis\u2019s\nnon-backtracking interpretation of counterfactuals: the surgical\nintervention that sets the variable SH at its hypothetical\nvalue but keeps all other equations unchanged is similar in its\neffects to Lewis\u2019s small miracle that realises the\ncounterfactual antecedent but preserves the past.\n\nIn general, to evaluate a counterfactual, say \u201cIf it were the\ncase that X1,\u2026,Xn, then\n\u2026\u201d, one replaces the original equation for each variable\nXi with a new equation stipulating its hypothetical\nvalue,while keeping the other equations unchanged; then one computes\nthe values for the remaining variables to see whether they make the\nconsequent true. This technique of replacing an equation with a\nhypothetical value set by a \u2019surgical intervention\u2019\nenables us to capture the notion of counterfactual dependence between\nvariables:\n\n(8)\nA variable Y counterfactually depends on a\nvariable X in a model if and only if it is actually the case\nthat X = x and Y = y and there exist\nvalues x\u2032 \u2260 x and y\u2032 \u2260 y\nsuch that replacing the equation for X with X =\n    x\u2032 yields Y = y\u2032.\n\nOf course, so far we just have something we are calling a\n\u2018causal model\u2019, \u27e8V, E\u27e9; we haven\u2019t\nbeen told anything about how to extract causal information from it. As\nshould be obvious by now, the basic recipe is going to be roughly as\nfollows: the truth of \u2018c causes e\u2019 (or\n\u2018c is an actual cause of e\u2019), where c\nand e are particular, token events, will be a matter of the\ncounterfactual relationship, as encoded by the model, between two\nvariables X and Y, where the occurrence of c is\nrepresented by a structural equation of the form X =\nx1 and the occurrence of e is represented by a\nstructural equation of the form Y = y1. We can see\nstraightaway, however, that we can\u2019t straightforwardly identify\ncausation with counterfactual dependence as defined in (8) above.\nThat would get us the truth of \u201cSuzy\u2019s throw caused her\nrock to hit the bottle\u201d (ST = 1 and SH = 1, and,\nsince SH = ST is a member of E, we know that if we\nreplace ST = 1 with ST = 0, we get SH = 0). But\nit won\u2019t get us, for example, the truth of \u201cSuzy\u2019s\nthrow caused the bottle to shatter\u201d, since if we replace\nST = 1 with ST = 0 and work through the equations we\nstill end up with BS = 1.\n\nHow, then, might we define \u2018actual causation\u2019 using the\nstructural equations framework? We\u2019ll get there by considering\nhow SEF deals with cases of late preemption such as the Suzy and Billy\ncase. Halpern and Pearl (2001, 2005), Hitchcock (2001), and Woodward\n(2003) all give roughly the same treatment of late preemption. The key\nto their treatment is the employment of a certain procedure for\ntesting the existence of a causal relation. The procedure is to look\nfor an intrinsic process connecting the putative cause and effect;\nsuppress the influence of their non-intrinsic surroundings by\n\u2018freezing\u2019 those surroundings as they actually are; and\nthen subject the putative cause to a counterfactual test. So, for\nexample, to test whether Suzy\u2019s throwing a rock caused the\nbottle to shatter, we should examine the process running from\nST through SH to BS; hold fix at its actual value\n(that is, 0) the variable BH which is extrinsic to this\nprocess; and then wiggle the variable ST to see if it changes\nthe value of BS. The last steps involve evaluating the\ncounterfactual \u201cIf Suzy hadn\u2019t thrown a rock and\nBilly\u2019s rock hadn\u2019t hit the bottle, the bottle would not\nhave shattered\u201d. It is easy to see that this counterfactual is\ntrue. In contrast, when we carry out a similar procedure to test\nwhether Billy\u2019s throwing a rock caused the bottle to shatter,we\nare required to consider the counterfactual \u201cIf Billy\nhadn\u2019t thrown his rock and Suzy\u2019s rock had hit the bottle,\nthe bottle would not shattered\u201d. This counterfactual is false.\nIt is the difference in the truth-values of these two counterfactuals\nthat explains the fact that it was Suzy\u2019s rock throwing, and not\nBilly\u2019s, that caused the bottle to shatter. (A similar theory is\ndeveloped in Yablo 2002 and 2004 though not in the structural\nequations framework.)\n\nHitchcock (2001) presents a useful regimentation of this reasoning. He\ndefines a route between two variables X and Z in\nthe set V to be an ordered sequence of variables <X,\nY1,\u2026, Yn, Z> such\nthat each variable in the sequence is in V and is a parent of\nits successor in the sequence. A variable Y (distinct from\nX and Z) is intermediate between X and\nZ if and only if it belongs to some route between X and\nZ. Then he introduces the new concept of an active causal\nroute:\n\n(9)\nThe route <X, Y1,\u2026,\nYn, Z> is active in the causal\nmodel <V, E> if and only if Z depends\ncounterfactually on X within the new system of equations\nE\u2019 constructed from E as follows: for all Y\nin V, if Y is intermediate between X and Z\nbut does not belong to the route <X,\nY1,\u2026, Yn, Z>,\nthen replace the equation for Y with a new equation that sets\nY equal to its actual value in E. (If there are no\nintermediate variables that do not belong to this route, then\nE\u2019 is just E.) (Hitchcock 2001: 286).\n\nThis definition generalises the informal idea sketched in the example\nof Suzy and Billy. <ST, SH, BS> is an active causal route\nbecause when we hold BH fixed at its actual value\n(Billy\u2019s rock doesn\u2019t hit the bottle), BS\ncounterfactually depends on ST. By contrast, the route\n<BT, BH, BS> is not active because when we hold SH\nfixed at its actual value (Suzy\u2019s rock does hit the bottle),\nBS does not counterfactually depend on BT.\n\nIn terms of the notion of an active causal route, Hitchcock defines\nactual or token causation in the following terms:\n\n(10)\nIf c and e are distinct actual events and X\nand Z are binary variables whose values represent the\noccurrence and non-occurrence of these events, then c is a\ncause of e if and only if there is an active causal route\nfrom X to Z in an appropriate causal model <V,\n    E>.\n\n(We shall return to the notion of an \u2018appropriate causal\nmodel\u2019 in\n \u00a75.3\n below.)\n\nAs stated, (10) doesn\u2019t handle cases of symmetric\noverdetermination \u2013 as when Suzy and Billy both throw their\nrocks independently, each throw is sufficient for the bottle to break,\nand both rocks hit the bottle \u2013 so neither throw preempts the\nother, since neither throw is on an active route as defined in (9).\nTo deal with such cases, Hitchcock weakens (10) by replacing the\n\u2018active route\u2019 in (10) with the notion of a weakly\nactive route (2001: 290). The essential idea here that there is a\nweakly active route between X and Z just when Z\ncounterfactually depends on X under the freezing of some\npossible, not necessarily actual, values of the variables that are not\non the route from X to Z. Intuitively, to recover\ncounterfactual dependence between Suzy\u2019s throw and the\nshattering we hold fixed BT = 0: had Suzy not thrown in the model\nwhere Billy doesn\u2019t throw, the bottle would not have\nshattered. Similarly for Billy\u2019s throw.\n\nThe basic strategy deployed here to deal with both preemption and\nsymmetric overdetermination bears an obvious similarity to\nLewis\u2019s quasi-dependence solution to the late preemption\nproblem. Lewis resorts to quasi-dependence because the shattering of\nthe bottle (e) does not counterfactually depend on Suzy\u2019s\nthrow (c), thanks to what would have happened had she not\nthrown (viz, Billy\u2019s rock would have shattered the bottle\ninstead). e quasi-depends on c, however, because of the\nfact that in a possible world with the same laws where the intrinsic\ncharacter of the process from c to e is the same but\nBilly doesn\u2019t throw, there is the required counterfactual\ndependence. \u2018Freezing\u2019 variables that are not intrinsic to\nthe c-e process at their actual values (in late\npreemption cases) \u2013 e.g. freezing BH at 0 \u2013 turns\nroughly the same trick. The core difference is that Lewis\u2019s\nsolution involves appealing to the truth of a perfectly ordinary\ncounterfactual (\u201cIf Suzy had not thrown, \u2026\u201d) at a\npossible world where some actual events (e.g. Billy\u2019s hit)\ndon\u2019t occur, while the structural-equations solution involves\nappealing to the truth of a counterfactual with a special kind of\nantecedent (\u201cHad Suzy not thrown and Billy\u2019s rock still\nnot hit, \u2026\u201d). Hitchcock calls these \u2018explicitly\nnonforetracking\u2019 (ENF) counterfactuals. (Similarly for symmetric\noverdetermination, where we \u2018freeze\u2019 BT at 0\n\u2013 this time a non-actual value \u2013 to recover counterfactual\ndependence between Suzy\u2019s throw and the shattering.)\n",
