    "main_text": "Preliminary Considerations || What are medieval theories of consequence theories of?\n1.2 What are medieval theories of consequence theories of?\n\nAt first sight, it is not immediately clear what the object of\nanalysis of medieval theories of consequence is (Boh 1982). Is it the\nsemantics of conditional sentences? Is it the validity of inferences\nand arguments? Is it the relation of consequence, construed as an\nabstract entity? In fact, at times it seems that medieval authors do not properly distinguish between these different notions. After all, these are very different concepts: a conditional\nis a sentence, which can be true or false; an argument or inference is\nan act, a consecution of assertions, which can be valid or invalid; a\nconsequence is a relation between sentential/propositional entities,\nwhich can hold or fail to hold (Sundholm 1998).\n\nHowever, even though the medieval authors may use the same terminology\nto refer to these different concepts, this does not mean that they are\nnot aware of the relevant differences, in particular between a\nconditional and a consequence (Normore 2015). As Buridan\n(Tractatus de Consequentiis (henceforth TC), 21) remarks, it\nis for the most part a matter of terminology: he says he will adopt\nthe definition of consequence as a true hypothetical sentence, but\nthen throughout his text also uses the terminology of a consequence\nbeing valid or holding rather than simply being true or false. At any\nrate, it seems fair to say that, even though analyses of conditionals\nare often in the background (as is especially obvious in Boethius and Abelard with examples such as \u2018if it is a human, it is an animal\u2019, and in analyses of the syncategorematic term\n\u2018si\u2019, \u2018if\u2019 (Spruyt 2018)), the main focus of\nmedieval theories of consequence tends to be the logical relations\nbetween sentential/propositional components (King 2001; Read 2010),\nessentially (though not entirely) in the spirit of modern accounts of\nthe notion of logical consequence (Shapiro 2005) (Caret and Hjortland 2015). Some modern scholars\n(e.g. Spade in his translation of Burley\u2019s De Puritate; Read\n2010) prefer to translate the medieval term\n\u2018consequentia\u2019 as \u2018inference\u2019, but\narguably \u2018consequence\u2019 is a more appropriate translation,\nboth for etymological and for conceptual reasons.\n\nOne may also wonder to what extent medieval theories of consequence\nreally add anything novel to the Aristotelian logical legacy. Kant\n(in)famously claimed that Aristotle had discovered everything there\nwas to know about logic, and insofar as they deal with logical\nrelations between sentences, it might be thought that theories of\nconsequence would not have added anything substantially new to\nAristotle\u2019s theory of syllogistic in particular. In fact, the\nrelations between theories of syllogistic and theories of consequence\nat different times seem essentially to fall within one of three\ncategories:\n\nSyllogistic and consequence are essentially disjoint concepts,\neach having their own foundations and scope. In such cases, the\nframework of Aristotle\u2019s Topics is often (though not always)\nsummoned to provide the foundations for non-syllogistic\narguments/consequences.\nAll valid arguments, including non-syllogistic ones, are\nultimately to be reduced to syllogistic arguments, as syllogistic\noffers the grounds for the validity of every single valid argument. A\nproponent of this approach is the 13th century author\nRobert Kilwardby.\nTheories of consequence are seen as an expansion and\ngeneralization of syllogistic; syllogistic is a special case of\nconsequence. In these cases, syllogistic is absorbed by consequence, which is a more general framework in that it can deal with a much wider range of inferences (Klima 2016). The 14th century author John\nBuridan, for example, treats extensively of syllogisms, both\nassertoric and modal, in his treatise on consequence.\n\n\nIt is fair to say that approach 3 became predominant in the\n14th century, the golden age of medieval theories of\nconsequence; but the earlier Boethian view that all valid arguments\n(including syllogistic arguments) are valid in virtue of topical rules\ncan also be seen as belonging to category 3. However, given that\nmedieval theories of syllogistic are treated extensively elsewhere\n(see the entry on medieval theories of the syllogism of this\nencyclopedia), in what follows we shall focus on non-syllogistic\nconsequences/arguments, but with the proviso that many of the\ninteresting developments in syllogistic in the 14th century\nare presented in treatises or chapters on consequence.\n\nAnother point worth mentioning is the fact that medieval discussions\nof the concept of consequence cover both what we would now describe as\n\u2018philosophy of logic\u2019 and as \u2018logic proper\u2019.\nAs for the latter, a number of medieval authors such as Abelard\n(Martin 2004), Burley (De Puritate), and Buridan (TC)\nformulated rules of inference and proved theorems about them (Klima 2016). Many\nauthors had for the most part understood the logical behavior of what\nwe now view as the main sentential/propositional operators, such as\n\u2018if\u2026then\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, negating terms, as\nwell as meta-level rules such as the transitivity of consequence,\n\u2018from the impossible anything follows\u2019, or \u2018the\nnecessary follows from anything\u2019 (the latter two were however\nnot unanimously endorsed \u2014 see (Martin 1986), (Read 1993,\n2010)). (For discussions of the rules formulated by different authors,\nsee (Pozzi 1978), (Boh 2001), (Dutilh Novaes 2008)). They also offered\nsophisticated investigations of the logical behavior of e.g. modal\nterms (Buridan, TC) (Johnston 2014).\n\nBesides this more technical layer, medieval authors also\ndiscussed extensively the very nature of the notion of consequence:\nwhat counts as appropriate grounds for a valid consequence, adequate\ndefinitions, subdivisions of kinds of consequence etc. In what\nfollows, the predominant focus will be on the \u2018philosophy of\nlogic\u2019 side of medieval theories of consequence, i.e. how they\narticulated this very notion, rather than on spelling out the exact\ninferential rules endorsed by the different authors. But some medieval\ntreatises on consequence also contain a high level of technical\nsophistication, even though the language used is the regimented\nacademic Latin of the time \u2013 the only symbolic device present is\nthe use of schematic letters, which in fact dates back to\nAristotle.\n",
