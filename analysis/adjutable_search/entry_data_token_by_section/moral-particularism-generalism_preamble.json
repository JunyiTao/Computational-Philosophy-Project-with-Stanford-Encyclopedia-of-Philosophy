    "main_text": "\n\nAmong the many questions that arise in the attempt to come to\nphilosophical grips with morality is what role, if any, moral\nprinciples have to play. Moral generalists think morality is best\nunderstood in terms of moral principles; moral particularists deny\nthis. To many people, ordinary moral practice seems suffused with\nprinciples (keep your promises; do not steal; do unto others as you\nwould have them do unto you). To many moral theorists, the central\ntask of moral theory has been to articulate and defend moral\nprinciples, or, perhaps, a single ultimate moral principle (maximize\nimpersonal happiness; act only on maxims that can be willed as\nuniversal law). The debate between particularists and generalists thus\nhas the potential to force a reassessment of both moral theory and\nmoral practice.\n\nThis characterization of the debate is so far too impressionistic to\nprovide a tractable framework for philosophical inquiry. The\nliterature reveals many ways to sharpen the debate, and sharpening is\nindeed needed. But both generalism and particularism are best seen as\nintellectual traditions in moral philosophy, each of which has a\nnumber of distinct but related strands. This article attempts to\ndisentangle some of those strands with the most attention being given\nto recent stages of this debate.\n\nThe arguments for and against both particularism and generalism are\nalso diverse, arising from metaphysics, epistemology, normative theory\nand the philosophy of language. These arguments also interact in\ninteresting ways with other debates in moral philosophy. Finally, it\nis very much an open and interesting question to what extent other\nareas of philosophy (e.g., the philosophy of language and\nepistemology) can usefully draw on ideas developed in the debate\nbetween moral particularists and moral generalists.\n\nMore recently, these debates have been juxtaposed with non-Western\ntraditions. For example, there has been some discussion of whether\nsome central works in Taoism presuppose particularism (Fraser 2022).\nThere has also been some discussion of how these debates interact with\nthe pragmatist tradition (Jackson 2017).\n",
