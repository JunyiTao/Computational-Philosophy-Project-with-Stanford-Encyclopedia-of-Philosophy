This could happen in either\nof two ways.\n\nFirst, happiness could be a major component of a theory of\nwell-being. Objective list theories of well-being sometimes include\nhappiness or related mental states such as enjoyment among the\nfundamental constituents of well-being. A more ambitious proposal,\noriginated by L.W. Sumner, identifies well-being with authentic\nhappiness\u2014happiness that is authentic in the sense of being\nboth informed and autonomous (Sumner 1996). The root idea is that\nwell-being involves being happy, where one\u2019s happiness is a\nresponse of one\u2019s own (autonomous), to a life that\ngenuinely is one\u2019s own (informed). The authenticity\nconstraint is meant to address both experience machine-type worries\nand \u201chappy slave\u201d objections relating to adaptation, where\nhappiness may be non-autonomous, depending on manipulation or the\nuncritical acceptance of oppressive values. Since these have been the\nmost influential objections to mental state accounts of well-being,\nSumner\u2019s approach promises to considerably strengthen the\nposition of happiness-centered approaches to well-being, and several\nphilosophers have developed variants or close relations of the\nauthentic happiness theory (Br\u00fclde 2007, Haybron 2008a,\nTiberius and Plakias 2010, Vi\u0161ak 2015). The approach remains fairly\nnew, however, so its long-term prospects remain \nunclear.[28]\n\nA second strategy forsakes the project of giving a unitary theory of\nwell-being, recognizing instead a family of two or more kinds of\nprudential value. Happiness could be central to, or even exhaustive\nof, one of those values. Shelly Kagan, for instance, has suggested\nthat welfare hedonism could be correct as a theory of how well a\nperson is doing, but not of how well a person\u2019s\nlife is going, which should perhaps be regarded as a distinct\nvalue (Kagan 1992, 1994). In short, we might distinguish narrow and\nwide well-being concepts. An experience machine user might be doing\nwell in the narrow sense, but not the wide\u2014she is doing well,\nthough her life is quite sad. Happiness might, then, suffice for\nwell-being, but only in the narrow sense. Others have made similar\npoints, but uptake has been limited, perhaps because distinguishing\nmultiple concepts of prudential value makes the already difficult job\nof giving a theory of well-being much harder, as Kagan pointedly\n observes.[29]\n An interesting possibility is that the locution \u2018happy\nlife\u2019, and the corresponding well-being sense of happiness,\nactually refers to a specific variety of well-being\u2014perhaps\nwell-being in the wide sense just suggested, or well-being taken as an\nideal state, an ultimate goal of deliberation. This might explain the\ncontinued use of \u2018happiness\u2019 for the well-being notion in\nthe philosophical literature, rather than the more standard\n\u2018wellbeing.\u2019\n",
