    "main_text": "The normative status of what?\n1. The normative status of what?\n\nBefore we can hope to make any headway with these questions a number\nof clarifications are in order. First and foremost, in asking after\nthe normative status of logic, we had better get clearer on what we\nmean by \u201clogic\u201d. For present purposes, I will take a logic\nto be a specification of a relation of logical consequence on a set of\ntruth-bearers. Moreover, I will assume consequence relations to\nnecessarily preserve truth in virtue of logical form. For simplicity,\nI will use \u201c\\(\\models\\)\u201d to denote such a consequence\nrelation. My default assumption will be to take the double turnstile\nto denote the semantic consequence relation of the classical\nfirst-order predicate calculus. But not much hangs on this. Partisans\nof other types of non-classical consequence relations may read\n\u201c\\(\\models\\)\u201d as referring to their preferred consequence\nrelation.\n\nPresumably, if logic is normative for thinking or reasoning, its\nnormative force will stem, at least in part, from the fact that truth\nbearers which act as the relata of our consequence relation and the\nbearers of other logical properties are identical to (or at least are\nvery closely related in some other way) to the objects of thinking or\nreasoning: the contents of one\u2019s mental states or acts such as\nthe content of one\u2019s beliefs or inferences, for example. For\npresent purposes I will assume the identity between truth-bearers and\nthe contents of our attitudes, and I will assume them to be\npropositions.\n",
