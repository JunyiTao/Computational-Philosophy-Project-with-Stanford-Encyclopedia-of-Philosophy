    "main_text": "History of Molecular Biology || Going Molecular\n1.3 Going Molecular\n\nIn a 1963 letter to Max Perutz, molecular biologist Sydney Brenner\nforeshadowed what would be molecular biology\u2019s next intellectual\nmigration:\n\n\nIt is now widely realized that nearly all the \u201cclassical\u201d\nproblems of molecular biology have either been solved or will be\nsolved in the next decade\u2026. Because of this, I have long felt\nthat the future of molecular biology lies in the extension of research\nto other fields of biology, notably development and the nervous\nsystem. (Brenner, letter to Perutz, 1963)\n\n\nAlong with Brenner, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of the\nleading molecular biologists from the classical period redirected\ntheir research agendas, utilizing the newly developed molecular\ntechniques to investigate unsolved problems in other fields. Francois\nJacob, Jacques Monod and their colleagues used the bacteria\nEscherichia coli to investigate how environmental conditions\nimpact gene expression and regulation (Jacob and Monod 1961; discussed\nin Craver and Darden 2013; Morange 1998: Ch. 14; Schaffner 1974a;\nWeber 2005; see also the entry on the\n developmental biology).\n The study of behavior and the nervous system also lured some\nmolecular biologists. Finding appropriate model organisms that could\nbe subjected to molecular genetic analyses proved challenging.\nReturning to the fruit flies used in Mendelian genetics, Seymour\nBenzer induced behavioral mutations in Drosophila as a\n\u201cgenetic scalpel\u201d to investigate the pathways from genes\nto behavior (Benzer 1968; Weiner 1999). And at Cambridge, Sydney\nBrenner developed the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans,\nto study the nervous system, as well as the genetics of behavior\n(Brenner 1973, 2001; Ankeny 2000; Brown 2003). In subsequent decades,\nthe study of cells was transformed from descriptive cytology into\nmolecular cell biology (Alberts et al. 1983; Alberts et al. 2002;\nBechtel 2006). Molecular evolution developed as a phylogenetic method\nfor the comparison of DNA sequences and whole genomes; molecular\nsystematics sought to research the evolution of the genetic code as\nwell as the rates of that evolutionary process by comparing\nsimilarities and differences between molecules (Dietrich 1998; see\nalso the entries on\n evolution,\n heritability, and\n adaptationism).\n The immunological relationship between antibodies and antigens was\nrecharacterized at the molecular level (Podolsky and Tauber 1997;\nSchaffner 1993; see also the entry on the\n philosophy of immunology).\n And the study of oncogenes in cancer research as well as the\nmolecular bases of mental illness were examples of advances in\nmolecular medicine (Morange 1997b; see also the entry on\n philosophy of psychiatry).\n\nThis process of \u201cgoing molecular\u201d thus generally amounted\nto using experimental methods from molecular biology to examine\ncomplex phenomena (be it gene regulation, behavior, or evolution) at\nthe molecular level. The molecularization of many fields introduced a\nrange of issues of interest to philosophers. Inferences made about\nresearch on model organisms such as worms and flies raised questions\nabout extrapolation (see\n Section 3.3).\n And the reductive techniques of molecular biology raised questions\nabout whether scientific investigations should always strive to reduce\nto lower and lower levels (see\n Section 3.1).\n",
