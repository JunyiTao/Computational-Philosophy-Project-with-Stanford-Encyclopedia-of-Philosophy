    "main_text": "Overview || Logic of Games\n1.1 Logic of Games\n\nSpecific games stand for significant recurrent patterns of social\ninteraction. In a perspective called \u2018logic of games\u2019,\nnotions and results from logic are used to analyze the structure of\nvarious games. In fact, much classic reasoning about games involves\nnotions that are familiar from logic.\n\nExample Game solution reasoning.\n\nConsider the following game tree for two players A, E,\nwith turns marked, and with pay-offs written with the value for\nA first. Alternatively, these values can be interpreted as\nencoding players\u2019 qualitative (or ordinal) preferences between\noutcomes.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nHere is how players might reason. At her turn, E faces a\nstandard decision problem, with two available actions and the outcome\nof action left better for her than that of right. So\nshe will choose left. Knowing this, A expects that his choosing\nright will give him outcome 0, while going left\ngives him outcome 1, so he chooses left. As a result, both players are\nworse off than they would have been, had they played\nright/right. The reasoning in this scenario, in\nshort, leads to an outcome that is not Pareto-optimal.\n\nThe example raises the question just why players should act this way,\nand whether, say, a more cooperative behavior could also be justified.\nAn answer obviously depends on the players\u2019 information and\nstyle of reasoning. Here it becomes of interest to probe the structure\nof the example. Looking more closely, many notions are involved in the\nabove scenario: actions and their results, players knowledge about the\nstructure of the game, their preferences about its results, but also\nhow they believe the game will proceed. There are even counterfactual\nconditionals in the background, such as A\u2019s explaining\nhis choice afterwards by saying that \u201cif I had played\nright, E would have played left\u201d. These\nnotions, moreover, are entangled in subtle ways. For instance,\nA does not choose left because it dominates\nright in the standard sense of always being better for him,\nbut rather because left dominates right according to\nhis beliefs. How these beliefs are formed, in turn, depends on many\nother features of the game, including the nature of the players.\n\nIn short, even a very simple game like the one discussed brings\ntogether large parts of the agenda of philosophical logic in one very\nconcrete setting. This entry will zoom in on the aspects mentioned\nhere, with\n Section 3\n dedicated to players\u2019 preferences and beliefs, while\n Section 4\n addresses reasoning styles and the dynamics of attitudes as the game\nproceeds.\n\nThe analysis is structured by a few broad distinctions. Intuitively,\ngames involve several phases that involve logic in different ways:\ndeliberation prior to the game, as many game-theoretic solution\nconcepts are in fact deliberation procedures that create initial\nexpectations about how a game will go on. Observation and belief\nrevision during game play, including reactions to deviations from\nprior expectations. And finally, post-game analysis, say, to settle\nwhat can be learnt from a defeat, or to engage in spin about\none\u2019s performance. Moreover all this can be considered in two\nmodes, assuming either a first-person participant or a third-person\nobserver view of games and play.\n\n",
