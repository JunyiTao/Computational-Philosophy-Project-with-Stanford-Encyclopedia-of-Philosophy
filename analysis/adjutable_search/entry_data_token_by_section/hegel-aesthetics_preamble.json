    "main_text": "\n\n\nG.W.F. Hegel\u2019s aesthetics, or philosophy of art, forms part of\nthe extraordinarily rich German aesthetic tradition that stretches from\nJ.J. Winckelmann\u2019s Thoughts on the Imitation of the Painting\nand Sculpture of the Greeks (1755) and G.E. Lessing\u2019s\nLaocoon (1766) through Immanuel Kant\u2019s Critique of\nthe Power of Judgment (1790) and Friedrich Schiller\u2019s\nLetters on the Aesthetic Education of Man (1795) to Friedrich\nNietzsche\u2019s Birth of Tragedy (1872) and (in the\ntwentieth century) Martin Heidegger\u2019s The Origin of the Work\nof Art (1935\u20136) and T.W. Adorno\u2019s Aesthetic Theory\n(1970). Hegel was influenced in particular by Winckelmann, Kant and\nSchiller, and his own thesis of the \u201cend of art\u201d (or what\nhas been taken to be that thesis) has itself been the focus of close\nattention by Heidegger and Adorno. Hegel\u2019s philosophy of art is a\nwide ranging account of beauty in art, the historical development of\nart, and the individual arts of architecture, sculpture, painting,\nmusic and poetry. It contains distinctive and influential analyses of\nEgyptian art, Greek sculpture, and ancient and modern tragedy, and is\nregarded by many as one of the greatest aesthetic theories to have been\nproduced since Aristotle\u2019s Poetics.\n",
