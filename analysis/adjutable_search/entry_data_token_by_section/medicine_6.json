Observational Studies and Case Reports\n\nFrequently, in the biomedical sciences, reliable animal or other\nnon-human models are not available and RCTs on humans are infeasible\nfor ethical or practical reasons. In these and other cases, biomedical\nhypotheses can be established using observational methods. As we have\nseen in\n Section 5,\n evidence-based medicine regards observational methods as generally\nless reliable than RCTs and other experimental methods. This is\nbecause observational studies are subject to a host of confounders and\nbiases that can be controlled when the hypothesis is tested by\na\u2014well-designed and well-conducted\u2014RCT. But it is not the\ncase that observational methods cannot deliver reliable results. In\nfact, it is well possible that the medical knowledge that has been\nestablished observationally by far exceeds the knowledge that comes\nfrom RCTs. Here are some examples of medical interventions that are\nwidely accepted as effective but whose effectiveness has not been\ntested using RCTs: penicillin in the treatment of pneumonia, aspirin\nfor mild headache, diuretics for heart failure, appendectomy for acute\nappendicitis and cholecystectomy for gallstone disease (Worrall 2007a:\n986); automatic external defibrillation to start a stopped heart,\ntracheostomy to open a blocked air passage, the Heimlich maneuver to\ndislodge an obstruction in the breathing passages, rabies vaccines and\nepinephrine in the treatment of anaphylactic shock (Howick 2011b,\n40).\n\nObservational studies often begin by reporting a recorded correlation\nbetween a medical outcome of interest and one or a set of independent\nvariables: lung cancer rates are higher in groups of smokers than in\ngroups of non-smokers, liver cancer rates are higher in populations\nthat tend to consume food that has been contaminated with aflatoxin\nthan in populations whose food is uncontaminated, to give a few\nexamples. That smoking causes lung cancer, or aflatoxin cancer of the\nliver, would indeed account for the observed correlations. But so\nwould a variety of other hypotheses. Generally, if two variables\nX and Y are correlated, it may be the case that\nX causes Y, Y causes X or a common\nfactor Z causes both X and Y (or a\ncombination of these). In the smoking/lung cancer case, all three\nhypotheses were invoked as possible accounts of the data. Ronald\nFisher famously proposed that it may be the case that early stages of\nbronchial carcinoma cause an individual to crave cigarettes, and he\nprovided some evidence that both smoking behavior and susceptibility\nto lung cancer have a common genetic basis (Fisher 1958). Moreover, it\nis possible that the correlation itself is spurious\u2014that the\ndata are correlated as per some measure of correlation such as\nPearson\u2019s coefficient, but that the underlying variables are not\nin fact correlated in the population of interest. Selection bias is\nnormally understood as the bias that obtains when individuals\nself-select into the observed population and the reasons for which\nthey do so are correlated with the outcome variable. If an\nobservational study examines only hospitalized patients and smokers\nare more likely to be in hospital for reasons that have nothing to do\nwith lung cancer, then smoking and lung cancer can be correlated in\nthe data even if the variables are independent in the general population.\nMismeasurement and diagnostic error provide another account of spurious correlation.\nSuppose tuberculosis was on the rise a generation or so after many\npeople traded pipe smoking for cigarette smoking. Then, if it was\ndifficult to distinguish a death from tuberculosis from a death from\nlung cancer because necropsy techniques were not sufficiently well\ndeveloped, the data might again show a correlation even though the\npopulation variables are uncorrelated.\n\nRetrospective observational studies work by ruling out alternative\nhypotheses such as these ex post rather than controlling for\nthem ex ante as RCTs do (Reiss 2015a). In an RCT,\nmismeasurement should not obtain because the protocol specifies\nmeasurement procedures for the outcome variables in great detail in\nadvance. Selection bias should not obtain because patients are\nrandomized into treatment groups. Once allocated to a group, they are\nprevented from obtaining another treatment elsewhere, and researchers\nmake sure that patients comply with the treatment regime. But there\nare equivalent means to rule out these possibilities in observational\nsettings. While it may well be the case that early stages of cancer\ncause a craving for cigarettes, this hypothesis cannot explain the\nprotective effect that stopping smoking has. At the time of the\nsmoking/lung cancer controversy in the mid-1950s, misdiagnosis was\nindeed a problem. However, it could be shown that in order to account\nfor the observed rise in lung cancer incidence, the diagnostic error\nat autopsy among older people would have to have been an order of magnitude \nhigher than the diagnostic error among younger people (Gilliam 1955).\nMismeasurement could therefore also be ruled out. Similar\nconsiderations helped to rule out other alternative hypotheses\n(Cornfield et al. 1959).\n\nEven if one were to believe, with the proponents of EBM, that\nobservational studies are generally less reliable than RCTs, medicine\ncould\u2014fairly obviously\u2014not do without them. There are\nlarge numbers of pressing questions that could not be addressed by an\nRCT for ethical, financial and other practical reasons. No-one would\nseriously consider testing a proposition such as \u201cAflatoxin\ncauses cancer of the liver (in humans)\u201d by an RCT. This is not\nmerely because of the straightforward ethical issues involved in\ndeliberately exposing humans to a potential carcinogen for the sake of\nmedical progress. It is also because exposure to low levels of aflatoxin can\ntake many years or even decades to produce symptoms. The ability of\nresearchers to control food intake in a large group of experimental\nsubjects for a very long has evident practical financial and\nlimitations. RCTs can also not be used when researchers or patients or\nboth cannot be blinded, and many medical interventions do require the\ndoctor\u2019s or the patient\u2019s knowledge of details about the\nintervention.\n\nMoreover, it is not clear that RCTs are always more reliable than\nobservational studies to answer questions both methods are able to\naddress. Whether or not a study is reliable depends on whether or not\nconfounders and biases have in fact been eliminated, not by which\nmethod they have been eliminated. Issues concerning the reliability of\na method can be entangled with issues concerning its ability to\naddress the research question the biomedical scientist seeks to\nanswer. Both RCTs and observational studies in the biomedical sciences\nare typically employed to test rather complex hypotheses about the\nsafety and efficacy of medical interventions. It may well be that some\nof the issues are more reliably treated by one method and others by\nthe other.\n\nA famous controversy in which the results from observational studies\nand those from RCTs conflicted was that over the benefits and safety\nof hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the early 2000s (Vandenbroucke\n2009). HRT seemed protective for coronary heart disease in\nobservational studies, whereas RCTs indicated an increase in the first\nyears of use. For breast cancer, combined hormone preparations showed\na smaller risk in an RCT than in observational studies. In the end it\nturned out that the timescale of the effects was responsible, and that\nbecause of the way they are typically run, observational studies got\nsome issues right and RCTs others:\n\n\nThe observational studies had picked up a true signal for the women\ncloser to menopause. In the randomised trial, that signal was diluted\nbecause fewer women close to menopause were enrolled\u2026 The\nrandomised trials had it right for coronary heart disease but failed\nto sufficiently focus on women close to menopause for breast cancer.\nThe main reasons for the discrepancies were changes of the effects of\nHRT over different times\u2026 (Vandenbroucke 2009: 1234)\n\n\nCase reports remain extremely popular in medicine both as publications\nto communicate within the field and for pedagogical purposes. In\nshort, a case report describes a medical problem experienced by one or\nmore patient, usually involving the presentation of an illness or\nsimilar that in some way difficult to explain or categorize based on\nexisting understandings of disease or understandings of physiology and\npathology. Cases in medicine take highly standardized forms of\npresentation which are inculcated in health care professionals during\ntheir education, and many have commented on their highly standardized\nnarrative structure and its epistemic and other implications (Hunter\n1991; Hurwitz 2006). Cases typically provide details on the\npresentation of the disease, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for\nthe patient, with a focus on practice-based observations and clinical\ncare (rather than the results of randomized controlled trials or other\nexperimental methodologies). One of the purposes of cases is to gather\ndetailed information including facts that may not be immediately\nrelevant, but that could prove to be (Ankeny 2011). Thus the\ninformation contained in the case and the case itself can be useful\nover the long term particularly if it can be systematically combined\nwith other cases into larger datasets.\n\nSingle cases are seen by some as problematic as a form of evidence\nparticularly in the era of EBM, because they often focus on highly\nunusual manifestations of illness and disease, rather than typical or\nrepeatedly observed conditions that might support generalizable rules.\nThis feature has led some to describe medicine as a \u201cscience of\nparticulars\u201d (Gorovitz and MacIntyre 1976), or as an art rather\nthan a science (Pellegrino 1979), particularly in processes of\ndiagnosis (see\n Section 9).\n However standard accounts of EBM include the case series as a type of\nevidence, which involves the aggregation of individual cases of\npatients with similar attributes (e.g., who received the same\ntreatment or therapy) who are tracked over time using descriptive data\nand without utilizing particular hypotheses to look for evidence of\ncause and effect. EBM does place the case series quite low in its\nhierarchy of evidence but nonetheless it is acknowledged that cases\nhave potential usefulness especially where forms of evidence that rate\nmore highly are not available, as may often be the case where human\npatients are concerned due to practical or ethical reasons, or where\nthe available evidence at higher levels has been produced in a manner\nthat is methodologically or otherwise flawed.\n\nCases can serve other purposes: for instance analyses of cases can\nprovide working hypotheses about casual attribution that can ground\nfurther tests of causal relations (Ankeny 2014), which in turn allows\nuse of more traditional methodologies such as RCTs, cohort studies,\nand so on to explore these causal hypotheses. In the context of\nclinical care, cases can allow health care providers to identify a\ncause that can be manipulated to cure (or prevent) the condition in\nquestion, in order to treat ill patients, even in the absence of more\nrigorous forms of evidence.\n",
