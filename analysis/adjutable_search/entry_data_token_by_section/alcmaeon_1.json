    "main_text": "Life and Works || Was Alcmaeon a Pythagorean?\n1.2 Was Alcmaeon a Pythagorean?\n\nCroton is also famous as the center of Pythagoras\u2019 activity from\nca. 530, when he left Samos. Alcmaeon addressed his book to three men\nwho may have been Pythagoreans:\n\nAlcmaeon of Croton, son of Peirithous, said the following to Brotinus,\nLeon, and Bathyllus\u2026 (DK, B1)\n\n\nWe know nothing of Leon and Bathyllus, except that Iamblichus, in\nOn the Pythagorean Way of Life (=VP), lists a\nPythagorean named Leon from Metapontum and a Pythagorean Bathylaus\nfrom Poseidonia (Paestum), both Greek cities of southern Italy\n(VP 267). Bro(n)tinus is identified as a Pythagorean from\nCroton in some places (D.L. VIII. 42; Iamb. VP 132) and from\nMetapontum in others (VP 194, 267). He is either the father\nor the husband of Theano, who is in turn either the wife or student of\nPythagoras. Does this \u201cdedication\u201d of his book to\nPythagoreans indicate that Alcmaeon himself was a Pythagorean? Even if\nthis is a dedication, it does not follow that Alcmaeon agreed with the\nviews of his addressees. Comparison with Empedocles\u2019 address to\nPausanias suggests, moreover, that what we have is not a dedication\nbut an exhortation or an attempt to instruct (Vlastos 1953, 344, n.\n25). Comparison with other early Greek prose writers such as Hecataeus\nand Heraclitus shows that books could begin with criticism of the\nviews of others so that Alcmaeon\u2019s address to these Pythagoreans\nmay be polemical (Kouloumentas 2018).\n\nDiogenes Laertius, in his Lives of the Philosophers\n(3rd century AD), includes Alcmaeon among the Pythagoreans\nand says that he studied with Pythagoras (VIII. 83). Later authors\nsuch as Iamblichus (VP 104, 267), Philoponus (De An.\np. 88), and the scholiast on Plato (Alc. 121e) also call\nAlcmaeon a Pythagorean. A majority of scholars up to the middle of the\ntwentieth century followed this tradition. However, it is not true\nthat the ancient \u201ctradition is unanimous in presenting him as a\nPythagorean\u201d (Zhmud 2012a, 123). In fact, the majority of\nancient sources do not describe him as a Pythagorean (e.g., Clement\n[DK 24A2], Galen [DK24A2], Aetius [DK 24A4, 6, 8\u201310, 13,\n17\u201318], Censorinus [DK 24A13\u201314], and Chalcidius [DK\nA10]). The best argument for regarding him as Pythagorean would be his\ninclusion in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue of Pythagoreans at the end of\nhis On the Pythagorean Life, if we could be sure that all\nparts of that catalogue go back to Aristoxenus in the fourth century,\nsince Aristoxenus is a very knowledgeable source on Pythagoreanism\n(Zhmud 2012a, 122; 2012b, 241\u201343). However, certain parts of the\ncatalogue are very unlikely go back to Aristoxenus and we cannot be\ncertain that the inclusion of Alcmaeon was due to him (Huffman 2005,\n297\u201399). Apart from this possibility regarding Aristoxenus, no\none earlier than Diogenes Laertius (ca. 200 AD) calls Alcmaeon a\nPythagorean. Aristotle wrote two books on the Pythagoreans but wrote a\nseparate book on Alcmaeon. Aristotle and Theophrastus refer to him a\nnumber of times but never identify him as a Pythagorean, and this is\nthe practice of the doxographical tradition (see A4, 6, 8\u201310,\n13\u201314, 17\u201318, in DK 24). Simplicius\n(6th AD) reports that some have handed down the view that\nAlcmaeon is a Pythagorean but notes that Aristotle denies it (De\nAn. 32.3). Most telling is Aristotle\u2019s discussion of\nAlcmaeon in Metaphysics book I (986a22 ff.). He notes a\nsimilarity between Alcmaeon and a group of Pythagoreans in positing\nopposites as the principles of things but expresses uncertainty as to\nwho influenced whom. Earlier scholars took this comparison of Alcmaeon\nto the Pythagoreans as confirmation that he was a Pythagorean. Most\nscholars of the last fifty years, however, have come to recognize that\nAristotle\u2019s treatment of Alcmaeon here suggests the exact\nopposite; it only makes sense to compare him with the Pythagoreans and\nwonder who influenced whom, if he is not a Pythagorean (e.g., Guthrie\n1962, 341: \u201cAristotle \u2026 expressly distinguishes him from\nthe Pythagoreans\u201d). Certainly most of the opposites which are\nmentioned as crucial to Alcmaeon do not appear in the Pythagorean\ntable of opposites, and there is no trace of the crucial Pythagorean\nopposition between limit and unlimited in Alcmaeon. The overwhelming\nmajority of scholars since 1950 have accordingly regarded Alcmaeon as\na figure independent of the Pythagoreans (e.g., Guthrie 1962, 341;\nBurkert 1972, 289; KRS 1983, 339; Lloyd 1991, 167; Kahn 2001; Riedweg\n2005, 115; Primavesi 2012, 447. Zhmud [2012a, 121\u2013124; 2014,\n97\u2013102] is the notable exception), although, as a fellow citizen\nof Croton, he will have been familiar with their thought.\n",
