    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nSeemingly the central interests that justify having an entry on\ncausation in the law in a philosophy encyclopedia are: to understand\njust what is the law\u2019s concept of causation, if it has one; to\nsee how that concept compares to the concept of causation is use in\nscience and in everyday life; and to examine what reason(s) there are\njustifying or explaining whatever differences there may be between the\ntwo concepts of causation. Other entries in this encyclopedia deal\nwith the nature of causation as that relation is referred to in\nscience and in everyday life. The philosophical interest in the\nlaw\u2019s concept of causation is largely comparative: how does the\nlaw\u2019s concept differ, if at all, from the more general concept\nof causation analyzed in philosophy, and are there good reasons\nexplaining why there are such differences?\n\nThese three questions\u2014what is the law\u2019s concept of\ncausation and how and why does it differ from the general notion of\ncausation in science and everyday life\u2014are deceptively simple in\ntheir appearance. Yet describing a concept like causation as it is\nused in a body of discourse such as law, depends on a number of\nvariables examination of which early-on will precisify the questions\nlater pursued in this entry. These preliminary, clarificatory\nvariables are four in number.\n\nFirst: human law, unlike the \u201cnatural law\u201d of morality, is\ninherently parochial in the sense that human law varies from place to\nplace. (It does this because human law\u2019s existence depends in\npart upon facts of institutional history and these facts vary from\nplace to place.) So the question, \u201cwhose law?\u201d, looms\nlarge at the start of an enquiry such as this. What follows describes\ncausation as it is used in what may broadly be called the\nAnglo-American legal tradition\u2014the legal tradition of the United\nKingdom, the domains of its Commonwealth, and the United States.\nDespite this confession of a somewhat parochial focus, there are\nnonetheless universalist implications of this analysis. This is\nbecause there are strong similarities in the legal uses of causation\nin all presently existing legal systems, even when one is not confined\nto those of the English-speaking world. \n\nSecond, even when we restrict our focus to the law of some one legal\ntradition, within that tradition there will be discrete areas of law\nthat make use of causation in their liability rules, such as the areas\nof contracts, torts, property, constitutional, and criminal law within\nthe Anglo-American legal tradition. It is arguable that the precise\ncontours (and maybe even the central notion) of causation differs\nbetween such areas; for example, it is plausible to think that there\nis a significant difference between contract law\u2019s notion of\nconsequential damages following upon breach and criminal law\u2019s\nnotion of the proximate causation needed to make out a completed crime\n(Moore 2009a: Appendix). Accordingly, to prescind from any such\ndifferences as may exist between areas of law, this entry focuses on\nwhat those within the Anglo-American legal tradition regard as the\ndominant usage of causation in the law, which usage is to assign\nresponsibility to actors who cause harms to others. The areas\nof law where such assignment of cause-based responsibility\npredominates is in the law of crimes and the law of torts. The entry\naccordingly focuses on those two areas of law because they are central\nto the Anglo-American (and probably to any) legal system\u2019s use\nof causation. They are also the areas of law in which (by far) the\ngreatest attention has been paid to causation in both law and legal\ntheory.\n\nThird, we need to distinguish propositions of law containing\nthe concept of causation, from propositions about the law of\ncausation. Our concern is with the former kinds of propositions; the\nlatter propositions are the hypotheses of theorists (such as the\npresent writer) about the content of the propositions that obligate\nlegal professionals within their roles as legal professionals, i.e.,\nlaw. But it is the law itself that is the data from which a\nlegal concept such as causation-in-the-law is to be extracted.\n\nFourth, teasing out the contours of a concept such as causation from a\nbody of discourse such as the law is not (just) a matter of quoting or\nparaphrasing explicit legal definitions of that concept, no matter how\nauthoritative such definitions purport to be. Legal definitions of\ncausation are only the start of an analysis of what\n\u201ccause\u201d means in law. Also needed are two other items. One\nis the implicit concept of cause to be teased out from usages\nof the concept in propositions of law. Complex legal concepts as used\nin the decided cases will only rarely coincide completely with\nofficial legal definitions (which Roscoe Pound [1910] called,\nrespectively, \u201cthe law in action\u201d and \u201cthe law in\nthe books\u201d), even when such definitions speak univocally in\nfavor of some particular concept.\n\nThe other additional item needed is the purpose or value served by\nlegal doctrines employing a concept of causation. Legal concepts are\nfunctional (sometimes styled, \u201cinterpretive\u201d) concepts in\nthat their meaning is shaped by the values they serve in the doctrines\nin which they appear, as much as it is shaped by the linguistic\n(definitional and usage) facts above mentioned (Fuller 1958). \n\nThe law\u2019s concept of causation is thus a product of three\nfactors in combination:\n\nCausation\u2019s explicit definition in authoritative legal\ntexts.\nIts implicit definition extracted from the totality of usages\nof the concept in the legal doctrines making up a body of law.\nThe value(s) served by the use of a concept of causation in the\nlegal doctrines employing the concept.\n\n\nIn addition to these three factors (and remembering the cautionary,\nthird point made earlier distinguishing propositions of law from\npropositions about law), there are theories about what\ncausation does or should mean in law. Such theories have been proposed\nby legal theorists as they utter propositions about law. Such\ntheories, despite their non-authoritative source, have played a major\nrole in the history of thought about the nature of causation in the\nlaw. Some of such theories, to the extent their content accurately\nmirrors propositions of law, have even become part of the law of which\nthey are theories (Raz 2012).\n",
