    "main_text": "Motivation and Preliminaries || Problems for Regularity Theories\n1.1 Problems for Regularity Theories\n\nAccording to David Hume, causes are invariably followed by their\neffects: \n\n\nWe may define a cause to be an object, followed by another, and\nwhere all the objects similar to the first, are followed by objects\nsimilar to the second. (1748: section VII) \n\n\nAttempts to analyze causation in terms of invariable patterns of\nsuccession are referred to as \u201cregularity theories\u201d of\ncausation. There are a number of well-known problems facing regularity\ntheories, at least in their simplest forms, and these may be used to\nmotivate probabilistic approaches to causation. Moreover, an overview\nof these difficulties will help to give a sense of the kinds of\nproblem that any adequate theory of causation would have to solve.\n\n(i) Imperfect Regularities. The first difficulty is that most\ncauses are not invariably followed by their effects. For example,\nsmoking is a cause of lung cancer, even though some smokers do not\ndevelop lung cancer. Imperfect regularities may arise for two\ndifferent reasons. First, they may arise because of the\nheterogeneity of circumstances in which the cause arises. For\nexample, some smokers may have a genetic susceptibility to lung\ncancer, while others do not; some non-smokers may be exposed to other\ncarcinogens (such as asbestos), while others are not. Second,\nimperfect regularities may also arise because of a failure of\nphysical determinism. If an event is not determined to occur,\nthen no other event can be (or be a part of) a sufficient condition\nfor that event. The success of quantum mechanics\u2014and to a lesser\nextent, other theories employing probability\u2014has shaken our\nfaith in determinism. Thus it has struck many philosophers as\ndesirable to develop a theory of causation that does not presuppose\ndeterminism.\n\nThe central idea behind probabilistic theories of causation is that\ncauses change the probability of their effects; an effect may\nstill occur in the absence of a cause or fail to occur in its\npresence. Thus smoking is a cause of lung cancer, not because all\nsmokers develop lung cancer, but because smokers are more\nlikely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers. This is entirely\nconsistent with there being some smokers who avoid lung cancer, and\nsome non-smokers who succumb to it.\n\n(ii) Irrelevance. A condition that is invariably followed by\nsome outcome may nonetheless be irrelevant to that outcome. Salt that\nhas been hexed by a sorcerer invariably dissolves when placed in water\n(Kyburg 1965), but hexing does not cause the salt to dissolve. Hexing\ndoes not make a difference for dissolution. Probabilistic\ntheories of causation capture this notion of making a difference by\nrequiring that a cause make a difference for the probability of its\neffect.\n\n(iii) Asymmetry. If A causes B, then,\ntypically, B will not also cause A. Smoking causes lung\ncancer, but lung cancer does not cause one to smoke. One way of\nenforcing the asymmetry of causation is to stipulate that causes\nprecede their effects in time. But it would be nice if a theory of\ncausation could provide some explanation of the directionality of\ncausation, rather than merely stipulate it. Some proponents of\nprobabilistic theories of causation have attempted to use the\nresources of probability theory to articulate a substantive account of\nthe asymmetry of causation.\n\n(iv) Spurious Regularities. Suppose that a cause is regularly\nfollowed by two effects. Here is an example from Jeffrey (1969):\nSuppose that whenever the barometric pressure in a certain region\ndrops below a certain level, two things happen. First, the height of\nthe column of mercury in a particular barometer drops below a certain\nlevel. Shortly afterwards, a storm occurs. This situation is shown\nschematically in Figure 1. Then, it may well also be the case that\nwhenever the column of mercury drops, there will be a storm. If so, a\nsimple regularity theory would seem to rule that the drop of the\nmercury column causes the storm. In fact, however, the\nregularity relating these two events is spurious. The ability\nto handle such spurious correlations is probably the greatest source\nof attraction for probabilistic theories of causation.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n",
