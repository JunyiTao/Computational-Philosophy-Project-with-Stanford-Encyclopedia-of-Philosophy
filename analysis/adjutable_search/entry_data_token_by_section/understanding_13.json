Rather, it is our fundamental way of living in the world, and\nwe are \u201calways already\u201d engaged in understanding. Thus he\nwrites that:\n\n\nUnderstanding is not an acquaintance derived from knowledge, but a\nprimordially existential kind of being, which, more than anything\nelse, makes such knowledge and acquaintance possible (123\u20134;\ntrans. by Wrathall 2013).\n\n\nJust as Descartes spoke of himself as a res cogitans\u2014a\nthinking thing\u2014so for Heidegger we are, fundamentally,\nunderstanding things. As Gadamer elaborates the Heideggerian idea:\n\n\nUnderstanding is\u2026 the original form of the realization of\nDasein, which is being-in-the-world. Before any differentiation of\nunderstanding into the various directions of pragmatic or theoretical\ninterest, understanding is Dasein\u2019s mode of being. (Gadamer 1960\n[1989: 259])\n\n\nOne central element of this view is that we are always projecting\npossibilities onto the world around us. Or rather, it is not as if the\nworld first presents itself as a bare thing empty of possibilities,\nand then we construe it as possessing these possibilities; instead,\nour experience of the world is from the first suffused with this sense\nof possibility. To take an example that Samantha Matherne (2019) uses\nto illustrate Heidegger\u2019s view: when I first apprehend the\nmartini in front of me, I take it as offering a variety of\npossibilities\u2014to be sipped, to be thrown, to be shaken, to be\nstirred. If I then take the martini as to be sipped, I am seizing on\none of these possibilities and interpreting the martini in light of\nthis specific possibility. But my experience of the drink was never\ndevoid of an apprehension of possibilities altogether.\n\nA further question is why, on the Heideggerian framework, the state of\nprojecting possibilities does not count as epistemic or\ntruth-evaluable, even if we allow that it is also in some sense\nontological. After all, the possibilities that we project onto the\nworld might not be genuine or grounded in reality. As Grimm (2008)\nnotes, someone might think that apparently solid things (like\nbaseballs) could not possibly pass through other apparently solid\nthings (like tables), but learning about quantum tunneling might call\nthis into question, and transform one\u2019s sense of possibility.\nThere thus seem to be facts about the possibilities that the world\naffords, and it seems like a mind could either track these facts\naccurately, or not. But this appears to be a topic of interest not\njust to ontologists or metaphysicians, but to epistemologists as well\n(cf. Westphal 1999).\n",
