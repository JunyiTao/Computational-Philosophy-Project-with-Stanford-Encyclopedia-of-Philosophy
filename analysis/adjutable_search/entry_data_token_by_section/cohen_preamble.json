    "main_text": "\n\nHermann Cohen (b. 1842, d. 1918), more than any other single figure,\nis responsible for founding the orthodox neo-Kantianism that dominated\nacademic philosophy in Germany from the 1870s until the end of the\nFirst World War. Earlier German philosophers finding inspiration in\nKant tended either towards speculative, metaphysical idealism, or\nsought to address philosophical questions with the resources of the\nempirical sciences, especially psychology. In contrast, Cohen\u2019s\nseminal interpretation of Kant offered a vision of philosophy that\ndecisively maintained its independence from empirical psychology,\nwithout at the same time simply lapsing back into uncritical\nmetaphysics. Cohen brought these attitudes to bear on a wide range of\ntopics, writing systematically about epistemology, philosophy of\nscience, ethics, law, political theory, and aesthetics. His\nanti-psychologism became a defining commitment not only of the Marburg\nSchool of neo-Kantianism, founded by Cohen himself, but of orthodox\nneo-Kantianism more generally. Indeed, that commitment ultimately\ndefined the philosophical context from which, in the early twentieth\ncentury, both phenomenology and logical positivism emerged.\n\nNo less significant than his influence on academic philosophy, Cohen\nwas his generation\u2019s preeminent German-Jewish public\nintellectual and religious philosopher. His philosophical ethics and\npolitical theory provided the foundation for a non-Marxist, Kantian\ndemocratic socialism that informed his more popular and topical\nwritings. He argued publicly for universal suffrage and for the rights\nof workers to organize democratically-constituted collectives. He also\nsaw deep points of connection between ethics and religion, and\ndeveloped a view of Judaism as a fundamentally ethical system of\nbelief and practice. He argued that monotheism was the historical\nsource of the idea of universal ethical laws, and thus that Judaism\noffered the world its first model of a universalist morality. This\nview of Judaism\u2019s ethical significance ultimately informed\nCohen\u2019s public defense of the Jews\u2019 place in Germany not\nonly against anti-Semitic attacks, but also against the arguments of\nearly twentieth-century Zionists. However, Cohen\u2019s influence on\nJewish thought extends far beyond debates within Imperial Germany: his\nlate religious writings inspired a broad renewal in twentieth-century\nJewish ethics and philosophy of religion.\n",
