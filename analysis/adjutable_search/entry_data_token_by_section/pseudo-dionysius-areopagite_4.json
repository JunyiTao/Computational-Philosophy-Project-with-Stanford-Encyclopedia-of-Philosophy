    "main_text": "Outline and Content of the Works || Symbolic Theology\n3.3 Symbolic Theology\n\nOther names directly refer to visible things, whose multiplicity and\naccessibility to sensation make them easy for us to understand. The\ndifficulty with these names, referred to by Dionysius and the\nNeoplatonic tradition generally as \u201csymbols,\u201d is that they\nhave no inherent relation to the godhead at all. Their literal\nsignification is restricted to the realm of the sensuous, and so they\nmust be turned into metaphors if they are to become useful for\ntheology. This is the task of Dionysius\u2019 Symbolic\nTheology. Though the work itself is not extant, we find him\nundertaking the same project in each of his extant works.\n\nOne of Dionysius\u2019 favorite sources of symbols is a verse from\nthe 78th psalm: \u201cthe Lord awoke, like a strong man,\npowerful but reeling with wine.\u201d Taken literally, the verse\nindicates that God sleeps and gets drunk on wine, two activities that\nproperly apply only to embodied, visible beings. Only an embodied\nbeing can manifest the activities to which the names\n\u201csleep\u201d and \u201cdrunkenness\u201d literally refer. If\nwe are to apply such terms to God, they must be attached to a foreign,\nintelligible content that will be able to lead the interpreter of the\nsymbolic name to the contemplation of an intelligible name. In\n\u201csleep,\u201d for example, Dionysius finds a meaning common to\nboth intelligible and visible things: withdrawal from the world. He\nconcludes that God\u2019s sleep is his \u201cremoval from and lack\nof communication with the objects of his providence.\u201d In\ndrunkenness, Dionysius sees a kind of over-filling, and so he explains\nthat God\u2019s drunkenness is \u201cthe overloaded measurelessness\nof all goods in the one who is their cause.\u201d From the easily\ncomprehended literal meaning of the term, the reader rises to the more\ndifficult intelligible terrain of imparticipability and\nmeasurelessness.\n\nDrunkenness and sleep are what Dionysius calls \u201cdissimilar\nsimilarities.\u201d They strike us as exceptionally unworthy of God,\nand so are \u201cdissimilar,\u201d yet they reveal an intelligible\ntruth capable of leading us to him, and so are \u201csimilar.\u201d\nDionysius privileges such names over more appropriate names like\n\u201cgolden\u201d and \u201cluminous.\u201d The more that the\nname seems appropriate, the more we are likely to be lulled into\nthinking that we have adequately comprehended the godhead in our use\nof the name. The very materiality and ignobility of the dissimilar\nsimilarities cry out that the names do not literally describe the\ngodhead, and compel the reader to seek the intelligible truth behind\nthe name.\n\nWe may wonder whether the symbolic names are a necessary part of\ntheology at all, since their content belongs to the intelligible\ntheology and not to a \u201csymbolic\u201d theology. Dionysius\nrepeatedly affirms their necessity, not because of the character of\ntheir content, but because of the nature of the human soul. The soul\nmay be divided into two parts: one passionate and the other\npassionless. Passionate here means set in motion by things exterior to\nthe soul. The senses, for example, are passionate because they can\nonly function when an outside object gives them something to sense.\nDionysius follows a longstanding Neoplatonic tradition when he says\nthat most of us are unable to engage our passionless part directly.\nInstead, our passionless part comes into play only indirectly, through\nthe activity of the passionate part. By sensing the world around us,\nwe are led to contemplate its intelligible structures through the\nsensations we receive. Even those few human beings who can engage\ntheir passionless part directly find it helpful to shore up their\ncontemplation with examples drawn from the senses. Dionysius may\nunderstand the causality of God directly, and yet still find it\nhelpful to compare God\u2019s causality to the emanation of light\nfrom the sun.\n\nSuch examples do not require the presence of a revealed scripture.\nSkilled teachers in any subject are characterized by their ability to\ncome up with helpful examples drawn from ordinary experience when\nexplaining a difficult intelligible truth. Dionysius himself\nfrequently resorts to examples \u201cat our level\u201d in order to\nexplain something intelligible. The scriptural symbol goes further,\nattempting to reveal the God who is before and beyond even the\nintelligible truth. The highest human intellect has little ability to\nattain this truth directly, and so we cannot rely on intellectual\nteachers as guides to that truth. We require the gift of symbols,\nwhich tie our ordinary comprehension to the godhead beyond being. And\nso Dionysius does not describe the symbolic names as pedagogical tools\ndeveloped by theologians. The names appear instead in the ecstatic\nvisions of the prophets. Though Dionysius explicitly asserts our\ndependence on the Hebrew and Christian scriptures as the source of\nthese symbols, he has no qualms about embellishing the list of names\nwith symbols drawn from other traditions. For instance, he discusses\nat length the name of \u201cmixing bowl,\u201d which has no real\nsource in the Christian or Hebrew scriptures, but occurs centrally in\nthe Platonic philosophy deriving from Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus.\n",
