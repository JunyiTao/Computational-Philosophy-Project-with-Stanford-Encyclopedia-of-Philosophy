    "preamble": "\n\nErnst Cassirer occupies a unique place in twentieth-century\nphilosophy. His work pays equal attention to foundational and\nepistemological issues in the philosophy of mathematics and natural\nscience and to aesthetics, the philosophy of history, and other issues\nin the \u201ccultural sciences\u201d broadly conceived. More than\nany other German philosopher since Kant, Cassirer thus aims to devote\nequal philosophical attention both to the (mathematical and) natural\nsciences (Naturwissenschaften) and to the more humanistic\ndisciplines (Geisteswissenschaften). In this way, Cassirer,\nmore than any other twentieth-century philosopher, plays a fundamental\nmediating role between C. P.

    "main_text": "\n1. Biography\n\nCassirer was born on July 28, 1874 to a wealthy and cosmopolitan\nJewish family,in the German city of Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland).\nPart of the family lived in Berlin, including Cassirer\u2019s cousin\nBruno Cassirer, the distinguished publisher, who later published most\nof Cassirer\u2019s writings. Cassirer entered the University of\nBerlin in 1892. In 1894 he took a course on Kant with Georg Simmel,\nwho recommended Hermann Cohen\u2019s writings on Kant in particular.\nCohen, the first Jew to hold a professorship in Germany, was the\nfounder of the so-called Marburg School of neo-Kantianism, famous for\ninterpreting Kant\u2019s transcendental method as beginning with the\n\u201cfact of science\u201d and then arguing regressively to the\npresuppositions or conditions of possibility of this\n\u201cfact.\u201d Kant was thus read as an \u201cepistemologist\n[Erkenntniskritiker]\u201d or methodologist of science\nrather than as a \u201cmetaphysician\u201d in the tradition of\npost-Kantian German idealism. After learning of Cohen\u2019s writings\nfrom Simmel, Cassirer (then nineteen years old) proceeded to devour\nthem, whereupon he immediately resolved to study with Cohen at\nMarburg. He studied at Marburg from 1896 to 1899, when he completed\nhis doctoral work with a dissertation on Descartes\u2019s analysis of\nmathematical and natural scientific knowledge. This appeared, in turn,\nas the Introduction to Cassirer\u2019s first published work, a\ntreatment of Leibniz\u2019s philosophy and its scientific basis\n[Cassirer 1902]. Upon returning to Berlin in 1903, Cassirer further\ndeveloped these themes while working out his monumental interpretation\nof the development of modern philosophy and science from the\nRenaissance through Kant [Cassirer 1906, 1907a]. The first volume of\nthis work served as his habilitation at the University of Berlin,\nwhere he taught as an instructor or Privatdozent from 1906 to\n1919.\n\nIn 1919 Cassirer was finally offered professorships at two newly\nfounded universities at Frankfurt and Hamburg under the auspices of\nthe Weimar Republic. He taught at Hamburg from 1919 until emigrating\nfrom Germany in 1933. During these years Cassirer completed his\nthree-volume Philosophy of Symbolic Forms [Cassirer 1923,\n1925, 1929b], which broke fundamental new ground beyond the\nneo-Kantianism of the Marburg School and articulated his own original\nattempt to unite scientific and non-scientific modes of thought\n(\u201csymbolic forms\u201d) within a single philosophical vision.\nIn 1928 Cassirer offered a defense of Weimar [Cassirer 1929a] at the\nUniversity\u2019s celebration of the tenth anniversary of the\nRepublic, and in 1929\u201330 he served as the rector of the\nUniversity, as the first Jew to hold such a position in Germany. In\nthe Spring of 1929 Cassirer took part in a famous disputation with\nMartin Heidegger in Davos, Switzerland, where Heidegger explicitly\ntook Cohen\u2019s neo-Kantianism as a philosophical target and\ndefended his radical new conception of an \u201cexistential analytic\nof Dasein\u201d in the guise of a parallel interpretation of the\nphilosophy of Kant [Heidegger 1929]. Cassirer, for his part, defended\nhis own new understanding of Kant in the philosophy of symbolic forms\n\u2013 against Heidegger\u2019s insistence on the ineluctability of\nhuman finitude \u2013 by appealing to genuinely objectively valid,\nnecessary and eternal truths arising in both moral experience and\nmathematical natural science (see [Friedman 2000] [Gordon 2010]).\n\nAfter his emigration Cassirer spent two years lecturing at Oxford and\nthen six years at the University of G\u00f6teborg in Sweden. During\nthis time he developed his most sustained discussion of morality and\nthe philosophy of law as a study of the Swedish legal philosopher Axel\nH\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m [Cassirer 1939a] (see [Krois 1987, chap. 4]). He\nalso articulated his major statement on the relationship between the\nnatural sciences and the \u201ccultural sciences\u201d [Cassirer\n1942], which contained, among other things, an explicit rejection of\nRudolf Carnap\u2019s \u201cphysicalism\u201d (see [Friedman 2000,\nchap. 7]). Cassirer, like so many German \u00e9migr\u00e9s during\nthis period (including Carnap) then finally settled in the United\nStates. He taught at Yale from 1941 to 1944 and at Columbia in\n1944\u201345. During these years he produced two books in English\n[Cassirer 1944, 1946], where the first, An Essay on Man,\nserves as a concise introduction to the philosophy of symbolic forms\n(and thus Cassirer\u2019s distinctive philosophical perspective) as a\nwhole and the second, The Myth of the State, offers an\nexplanation of the rise of fascism on the basis of Cassirer\u2019s\nconception of mythical thought. Two important American philosophers\nwere substantially influenced by Cassirer during these years: Arthur\nPap, whose work on the \u201cfunctional a priori\u201d in physical\ntheory [Pap 1946] took shape under Cassirer\u2019s guidance at Yale,\nand Susanne Langer, who promulgated Cassirer\u2019s philosophy of\nsymbolic forms in aesthetic and literary circles (see, e.g., [Langer\n1942]). Cassirer\u2019s American influence thus embraced both sides\nof his philosophical personality. One can only speculate on what this\ninfluence might have been if his life had not been cut short suddenly\nby a heart attack while walking on the streets of New York City on\nApril 13, 1945.\n2. Early Historical Writings\n\nAs indicated above, Cassirer\u2019s first writings were largely\nhistorical in character \u2013 including a discussion of\nLeibniz\u2019s philosophy in its scientific context [Cassirer 1902]\nand a large-scale work on the history of modern thought from the\nRenaissance through Kant, Das Erkenntnisproblem in der Philosophie\nund Wissenschaft der neueren Zeit [Cassirer 1906, 1907a]. The\nlatter, in particular, is a magisterial and deeply original\ncontribution to both the history of philosophy and the history of\nscience. It is the first work, in fact, to develop a detailed reading\nof the scientific revolution as a whole in terms of the\n\u201cPlatonic\u201d idea that the thoroughgoing application of\nmathematics to nature (the so-called mathematization of nature) is the\ncentral and overarching achievement of this revolution. And\nCassirer\u2019s insight was explicitly acknowledged by such seminal\nintellectual historians as E. A. Burtt, E. J. Dijksterhuis, and\nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9, who developed this theme later in the century\nin the course of establishing the discipline of history of science as\nwe know it today (see, e.g., [Burtt 1925], [Koyr\u00e9 1939],\n[Dijksterhuis 1959]). Cassirer, for his part, simultaneously\narticulates an interpretation of the history of modern philosophy as\nthe development and eventual triumph of what he calls \u201cmodern\nphilosophical idealism.\u201d This tradition takes its inspiration,\naccording to Cassirer, from idealism in the Platonic sense, from an\nappreciation for the \u201cideal\u201d formal structures\nparadigmatically studied in mathematics, and it is distinctively\nmodern in recognizing the fundamental importance of the systematic\napplication of such structures to empirically given nature in modern\nmathematical physics \u2013 a progressive and synthetic process\nwherein mathematical models of nature are successively refined and\ncorrected without limit. For Cassirer, it is Galileo, above all, in\nopposition to both sterile Aristotelian-Scholastic formal logic and\nsterile Aristotelian-Scholastic empirical induction, who first grasped\nthe essential structure of this synthetic process; and the development\nof \u201cmodern philosophical idealism\u201d by such thinkers as\nDescartes, Spinoza, Gassendi, Hobbes, Leibniz, and Kant then consists\nin its increasingly self-conscious philosophical articulation and\nelaboration.\n\nIn both the Leibniz book and Das Erkenntnisproblem, then,\nCassirer interprets the development of modern thought as a whole from\nthe perspective of the basic philosophical principles of Marburg\nneo-Kantianism: the idea that philosophy as epistemology\n(Erkenntniskritik) has the articulation and elaboration of\nthe structure of modern mathematical natural science as its primary\ntask; the conviction that, accordingly, philosophy must take the\n\u201cfact of science\u201d as its starting point and ultimately\ngiven datum; and, most especially, the so-called \u201cgenetic\u201d\nconception of scientific knowledge as an ongoing, never completed\nsynthetic process (see below). From a contemporary point of view,\nCassirer\u2019s history may therefore appear as both\n\u201cWhiggish\u201d and \u201ctriumphalist,\u201d but it cannot\nbe denied that his work is, nevertheless, extraordinarily rich,\nextraordinarily clear, and extraordinarily illuminating. Cassirer\nexamines an astonishing variety of textual sources (including both\nmajor and minor figures) carefully and in detail, and, without at all\nneglecting contrary tendencies within the skeptical and empiricist\ntraditions, he develops a compelling portrayal of the evolution of\n\u201cmodern philosophical idealism\u201d through Kant which, even\ntoday, reads as extremely compelling and acute.\n\nCassirer must thus be ranked as one of the very greatest intellectual\nhistorians of the twentieth-century \u2013 and, indeed, as one of the\nfounders of this discipline as it came to be practiced after 1900. He\ncontinued to contribute to intellectual history broadly conceived\nthroughout his career (most notably, perhaps, in his fundamental\nstudies of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment [Cassirer 1927a,\n1932]), and he had a major influence on intellectual history\nthroughout the century. Aside from the history of science (see above),\nCassirer also decisively influenced intellectual historians more\ngenerally, including, notably, the eminent intellectual and cultural\nhistorian Peter Gay and the distinguished art historian Erwin Panofsky\n(see, e.g., [Gay 1977], [Panofsky 1939]). As we shall see below,\nintellectual (and later cultural) history is an integral part of\nCassirer\u2019s distinctive philosophical methodology, so that, in\nhis case, the standard distinction between \u201chistorical\u201d\nand \u201csystematic\u201d work in philosophy ends up looking quite\nartificial.\n3. Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science\n\nIt was noted above that Cassirer\u2019s early historical works\ninterpret the development of modern thought as a whole (embracing both\nphilosophy and the sciences) from the perspective of the philosophical\nprinciples of Marburg neo-Kantianism, as initially articulated in\n[Cohen 1871]. On the \u201cgenetic\u201d conception of scientific\nknowledge, in particular, the a priori synthetic activity of thought\n\u2013 the activity Kant himself had called \u201cproductive\nsynthesis\u201d \u2013 is understood as a temporal and historical\ndevelopmental process in which the object of science is gradually and\nsuccessively constituted as a never completed \u201cX\u201d towards\nwhich the developmental process is converging. For Cohen, this process\nis modelled on the methods of the infinitesimal calculus (in this\nconnection, especially, see [Cohen 1883]). Beginning with the idea of\na continuous series or function, our problem is to see how such a\nseries can be a priori generated step-by-step. The mathematical\nconcept of a differential shows us how this can be done, for the\ndifferential at a point in the domain of a given function indicates\nhow it is to be continued on succeeding points. The differential\ntherefore infinitesimally captures the rule of the series as a whole,\nand thus expresses, at any given point or moment of time, the general\nform of the series valid for all times,\n\nCassirer\u2019s first \u201csystematic\u201d work, Substance\nand Function [Cassirer 1910], takes an essential philosophical\nstep beyond Cohen by explicitly engaging with the late\nnineteenth-century developments in the foundations of mathematics and\nmathematical logic that exerted a profound influence on\ntwentieth-century philosophy of mathematics and natural science.\nCassirer begins by discussing the problem of concept formation, and by\ncriticizing, in particular, the \u201cabstractionist\u201d theory\ncharacteristic of philosophical empiricism, according to which general\nconcepts are arrived at by ascending inductively from sensory\nparticulars. This theory, for Cassirer, is an artifact of traditional\nAristotelian logic; and his main idea, accordingly, is that\ndevelopments in modern formal logic (the mathematical theory of\nrelations) allows us definitively to reject such abstractionism (and\nthus philosophical empiricism) on behalf of the genetic conception of\nknowledge. In particular, the modern axiomatic conception of\nmathematics, as exemplified especially in Richard Dedekind\u2019s\nwork on the foundations of arithmetic and David Hilbert\u2019s work\non the foundations of geometry, has shown that mathematics itself has\na purely formal and ideal, and thus entirely non-sensible meaning.\nPure mathematics describes abstract \u201csystems of order\u201d\n\u2013 what we would now call relational structures \u2013 whose\nconcepts can in no way be accommodated within abstractionist or\ninductivist philosophical empiricism. Cassirer then employs this\n\u201cformalist\u201d conception of mathematics characteristic of\nthe late nineteenth century to craft a new, and more abstract, version\nof the genetic conception of knowledge. We conceive the developmental\nprocess in question as a series or sequence of abstract formal\nstructures (\u201csystems of order\u201d), which is itself ordered\nby the abstract mathematical relation of approximate\nbackwards-directed inclusion (as, for example, the new non-Euclidean\ngeometries contain the older geometry of Euclid as a continuously\napproximated limiting case). In this way, we can conceive all the\nstructures in our sequence as continuously converging, as it were, on\na final or limit structure, such that all previous structures in the\nsequence are approximate special or limiting cases of this final\nstructure. The idea of such an endpoint of the sequence is only a\nregulative ideal in the Kantian sense \u2013 it is only progressively\napproximated but never in fact actually realized. Nevertheless, it\nstill constitutes the a priori \u201cgeneral serial form\u201d of\nour properly empirical mathematical theorizing, and, at the same time,\nit bestows on this theorizing its characteristic form of\nobjectivity.\n\nIn explicitly embracing late nineteenth-century work on the\nfoundations of mathematics, Cassirer comes into very close proximity\nwith early twentieth-century analytic philosophy. Indeed, Cassirer\ntakes the modern mathematical logic implicit in the work of Dedekind\nand Hilbert, and explicit in the work of Gottlob Frege and the early\nBertrand Russell, as providing us with our primary tool for moving\nbeyond the empiricist abstractionism due ultimately to Aristotelian\nsyllogistic. The modern \u201ctheory of the concept,\u201d\naccordingly, is based on the fundamental notions of function, series,\nand order (relational structure) \u2013 where these notions, from the\npoint of view of pure mathematics and pure logic, are entirely formal\nand abstract, having no intuitive relation, in particular, to either\nspace or time. Nevertheless, and here is where Cassirer diverges from\nmost of the analytic tradition, this modern theory of the concept only\nprovides us with a genuine and complete alternative to Aristotelian\nabstractionism and philosophical empiricism when it is embedded within\nthe genetic conception of knowledge. What is primary is the generative\nhistorical process by which modern mathematical natural science\nsuccessively develops or evolves, and pure mathematics and pure logic\nonly have philosophical significance as elements of or abstractions\nfrom this more fundamental developmental process of \u201cproductive\nsynthesis\u201d aimed at the application of such pure formal\nstructures in empirical knowledge (see especially [Cassirer\n1907b]).\n\nCassirer\u2019s next important contribution to scientific\nepistemology [Cassirer 1921] explores the relationship between\nEinstein\u2019s general theory of relativity and the\n\u201ccritical\u201d (Marburg neo-Kantian) conception of knowledge.\nCassirer argues that Einstein\u2019s theory in fact stands as a\nbrilliant confirmation of this conception. On the one hand, the\nincreasing use of abstract mathematical representations in\nEinstein\u2019s theory entirely supports the attack on Aristotelian\nabstractionism and philosophical empiricism. On the other hand,\nhowever, Einstein\u2019s use of non-Euclidean geometry presents no\nobstacle at all to our purified and generalized form of\n(neo-)Kantianism. For we no longer require that any particular\nmathematical structure be fixed for all time, but only that the\nhistorical-developmental sequence of such structures continuously\nconverge. Einstein\u2019s theory satisfies this requirement perfectly\nwell, since the Euclidean geometry fundamental to Newtonian physics is\nindeed contained in the more general geometry (of variable curvature)\nemployed by Einstein as an approximate special case (as the regions\nconsidered become infinitely small, for example). Moritz Schlick\npublished a review of Cassirer\u2019s book immediately after its\nfirst appearance [Schlick 1921], taking the occasion to argue (what\nlater became a prominent theme in the philosophy of logical\nempiricism) that Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity provides us\nwith a decisive refutation of Kantianism in all of its forms. This\nreview marked the beginnings of a respectful philosophical exchange\nbetween the two, as noted above, and it was continued, in the context\nof Cassirer\u2019s later work on the philosophy of symbolic forms, in\n[Cassirer 1927b] (see [Friedman 2000, chap. 7]).\n\nCassirer\u2019s assimilation of Einstein\u2019s general theory of\nrelativity marked a watershed in the development of his thought. It\nnot only gave him an opportunity, as we have just seen, to reinterpret\nthe Kantian theory of the a priori conditions of objective experience\n(especially as involving space and time) in terms of Cassirer\u2019s\nown version of the genetic conception of knowledge, but it also\nprovided him with an impetus to generalize and extend the original\nMarburg view in such a way that modern mathematical scientific\nknowledge in general is now seen as just one possible \u201csymbolic\nform\u201d among other equally valid and legitimate such forms.\nIndeed, [Cassirer 1921] first officially announces the project of a\ngeneral \u201cphilosophy of symbolic forms,\u201d conceived, in this\ncontext, as a philosophical extension of \u201cthe general postulate\nof relativity.\u201d Just as, according to the general postulate of\nrelativity, all possible reference frames and coordinate systems are\nviewed as equally good representations of physical reality, and, as a\ntotality, are together interrelated and embraced by precisely this\npostulate, similarly the totality of \u201csymbolic forms\u201d\n\u2013 aesthetic, ethical, religious, scientific \u2013 are here\nenvisioned by Cassirer as standing in a closely analogous\nrelationship. So it is no wonder that, subsequent to taking up the\nprofessorship at Hamburg in 1919, Cassirer devotes the rest of his\ncareer to this new philosophy of symbolic forms. (Cassirer\u2019s\nwork in the philosophy of natural science in particular also\ncontinued, notably in [Cassirer 1936].)\n4. The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms\n\nAt Hamburg Cassirer found a tremendous resource for the next stage in\nhis philosophical development \u2013 the Library of the Cultural\nSciences founded by Aby Warburg. Warburg was an eminent art historian\nwith a particular interest in ancient cult, ritual, myth, and magic as\nsources of archetypal forms of emotional expression later manifested\nin Renaissance art, and the Library therefore contained abundant\nmaterials both on artistic and cultural history and on ancient myth\nand ritual. Cassirer\u2019s earliest works on the philosophy of\nsymbolic forms appeared as studies and lectures of the Warburg Library\nin the years 1922\u20131925, and the three-volume Philosophy of\nSymbolic Forms itself appeared, as noted above, in 1923, 1925,\nand 1929 respectively. Just as the genetic conception of knowledge is\nprimarily oriented towards the \u201cfact of science\u201d and,\naccordingly, takes the historical development of scientific knowledge\nas its ultimate given datum, the philosophy of symbolic forms is\noriented towards the much more general \u201cfact of culture\u201d\nand thus takes the history of human culture as a whole as its ultimate\ngiven datum. The conception of human beings as most fundamentally\n\u201csymbolic animals,\u201d interposing systems of signs or\nsystems of expression between themselves and the world, then becomes\nthe guiding philosophical motif for elucidating the corresponding\nconditions of possibility for the \u201cfact of culture\u201d in all\nof its richness and diversity.\n\nCharacteristic of the philosophy of symbolic forms is a concern for\nthe more \u201cprimitive\u201d forms of world-presentation\nunderlying the \u201chigher\u201d and more sophisticated cultural\nforms \u2013 a concern for the ordinary perceptual awareness of the\nworld expressed primarily in natural language, and, above all, for the\nmythical view of the world lying at the most primitive level of all.\nFor Cassirer, these more primitive manifestations of \u201csymbolic\nmeaning\u201d now have an independent status and foundational role\nthat is quite incompatible with both Marburg neo-Kantianism and\nKant\u2019s original philosophical conception. In particular, they\nlie at a deeper, autonomous level of spiritual life which then gives\nrise to the more sophisticated forms by a dialectical developmental\nprocess. From mythical thought, religion and art develop; from natural\nlanguage, theoretical science develops. It is precisely here that\nCassirer appeals to \u201cromantic\u201d philosophical tendencies\nlying outside the Kantian and neo-Kantian tradition, deploys an\nhistorical dialectic self-consciously derived from Hegel, and comes to\nterms with the contemporary Lebensphilosophie of Wilhelm\nDilthey, Henri Bergson, Max Scheler, and Georg Simmel \u2013 as well\nas with the closely related philosophy of Martin Heidegger.\n\nThe most basic and primitive type of symbolic meaning is\nexpressive meaning, the product of what Cassirer calls the\nexpressive function (Ausdrucksfunktion) of thought, which is\nconcerned with the experience of events in the world around us as\ncharged with affective and emotional significance, as desirable or\nhateful, comforting or threatening. It is this type of meaning that\nunderlies mythical consciousness, for Cassirer, and which explains its\nmost distinctive feature, namely, its total disregard for the\ndistinction between appearance and reality. Since the mythical world\ndoes not consist of stable and enduring substances that manifest\nthemselves from various points of view and on various occasions, but\nrather in a fleeting complex of events bound together by their\naffective and emotional \u201cphysiognomic\u201d characters, it also\nexemplifies its own particular type of causality whereby each part\nliterally contains the whole of which it is a part and can thereby\nexert all the causal efficacy of the whole. Similarly, there is no\nessential difference in efficacy between the living and the dead,\nbetween waking experiences and dreams, between the name of an object\nand the object itself, and so on. The fundamental Kantian\n\u201ccategories\u201d of space, time, substance (or object), and\ncausality thereby take on a distinctive configuration representing the\nformal a priori structure, as it were, of mythical thought.\n\nWhat Cassirer calls representative symbolic meaning, a\nproduct of the representative function (Darstellungsfunktion)\nof thought, then has the task of precipitating out of the original\nmythical flux of \u201cphysiognomic\u201d characters a world of\nstable and enduring substances, distinguishable and reidentifiable as\nsuch. Working together with the fundamentally pragmatic orientation\ntowards the world exhibited in the technical and instrumental use of\ntools and artifacts, it is in natural language, according to Cassirer,\nthat the representative function of thought is then most clearly\nvisible. For it is primarily through the medium of natural language\nthat we construct the \u201cintuitive world\u201d of ordinary sense\nperception on the basis of what Cassirer calls intuitive space and\nintuitive time. The demonstrative particles (later articles) and\ntenses of natural language specify the locations of perceived objects\nin relation to the changing spatio-temporal position of the speaker\n(relative to a \u201chere-and-now\u201d), and a unified\nspatio-temporal order thus arises in which each designated object has\na determinate relation to the speaker, his/her point of view, and\nhis/her potential range of pragmatic activities. We are now able to\ndistinguish the enduring thing-substance, on the one side, from its\nvariable manifestations from different points of view and on different\noccasions, on the other, and we thereby arrive at a new fundamental\ndistinction between appearance and reality. This distinction is then\nexpressed in its most developed form, for Cassirer, in the linguistic\nnotion of propositional truth and thus in the propositional copula.\nHere the Kantian \u201ccategories\u201d of space, time, substance,\nand causality take on a distinctively intuitive or\n\u201cpresentational\u201d configuration.\n\nThe distinction between appearance and reality, as expressed in the\npropositional copula, then leads dialectically to a new task of\nthought, the task of theoretical science, of systematic inquiry into\nthe realm of truths. Here we encounter the third and final function of\nsymbolic meaning, the significative function\n(Bedeutungsfunktion), which is exhibited most clearly,\naccording to Cassirer, in the \u201cpure category of relation.\u201d\nFor it is precisely here, in the scientific view of the world, that\nthe pure relational concepts characteristic of modern mathematics,\nlogic, and mathematical physics are finally freed from the bounds of\nsensible intuition. For example, mathematical space and time arise\nfrom intuitive space and time when we abstract from all demonstrative\nrelation to a \u201chere-and-now\u201d and consider instead the\nsingle system of relations in which all possible\n\u201chere-and-now\u201d-points are embedded; the mathematical\nsystem of the natural numbers arises when we abstract from all\nconcrete applications of counting and consider instead the single\npotentially infinite progression wherein all possible applications of\ncounting are comprehended; and so on. The eventual result is the world\nof modern mathematical physics described in Cassirer\u2019s earlier\nscientific works \u2013 a pure system of formal relations where, in\nparticular, the intuitive concept of substantial thing has finally\nbeen replaced by the relational-functional concept of universal law.\nSo it is here, and only here, that the generalized and purified form\nof (neo-)Kantianism distinctive of the Marburg School gives an\naccurate characterization of human thought. This characterization is\nnow seen as a one-sided abstraction from a much more comprehensive\ndialectical process which can no longer be adequately understood\nwithout paying equal attention to its more concrete and intuitive\nsymbolic manifestations; and it is in precisely this way, in the end,\nthat the Marburg \u201cfact of science\u201d is now firmly embedded\nwithin the much more general \u201cfact of culture\u201d as a\nwhole.\n5. Cassirer, Hegel and the Cultural Sciences\n\nCassirer emphasizes the kinship between his Philosophy of Symbolic\nForms and Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology of Spirit in the\nPrefaces to both the second (1925) and third (1929) volumes. Recent\ncommentators ([Skidelsky 2008] [Moss 2015]) have illuminatingly built\non this circumstance in further articulating the relationship between\nCassirer and Hegel. Considerable light is shed on this relationship by\nCassirer\u2019s treatment of the problem of the\nNaturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften in\nThe Logic of the Cultural Sciences (1942). We shall return to\nthis situation in the next section.\n\nHegel had conceived nature (Natur) and spirit\n(Geist) as two different expressions of a single divine\ninfinite Reason, which manifests itself temporally from two different\npoints of view. His project of an encyclopedia of philosophical\nsciences had three parts, the logic, the philosophy of nature, and the\nphilosophy of spirit, where the logic had the task of depicting the\ndialectical conceptual structure of infinite divine Reason itself. But\nthis Hegelian project for securing the ultimate logico-metaphysical\nidentity of nature and spirit found ever fewer followers as the\ncentury progressed, as the rising tide of neo-Kantianism \u2013 aided\nby further developments within the natural sciences instigated by\nHermann von Helmholtz \u2013 undermined the appeal of the original\nNaturphilosophie of Schelling and Hegel together with their\nAbsolute Reason. The result was the problem of the\nNaturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften as it\npresented itself to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n[Cassirer 1942] develops a characteristically methodological\nperspective on this problem by treating both disciplines as\nempirical rather than \u201cspeculative\u201d sciences (in\nthe sense of Schelling and Hegel) and elucidating their methodological\nrelationship within the philosophy of symbolic forms.\n\n[Cassirer 1942] argues that the empirical evidential basis for the\ncultural sciences starts from the same realm of perceived physical\nobjects and processes distributed in space and time as do the natural\nsciences \u2013 in this case documents, artifacts, rituals,\nperformances \u2013 but it goes on to imbue them with a symbolic\n\u201csense\u201d or \u201cmeaning\u201d that is not at issue in\nthe natural sciences. We must distinguish, in particular, between the\nrepresentative function (Darstellungsfunktion) and the\nexpressive function (Ausdrucksfunktion) of thought, and only\na prejudice privileging \u201cthing perception\n[Dingwahrnehmen]\u201d over \u201cexpressive perception\n[Ausdruckswahrnehmen]\u201d can support the idea that the\nnatural sciences have a more secure evidential basis than he cultural\nsciences. (It is precisely this prejudice which, according to\nCassirer, lies behind Carnap\u2019s \u201cphysicalism.\u201d) For\nCassirer, by contrast, both forms of perception are equally\nlegitimate. While the natural sciences take their evidence from the\nsphere of thing perception, the cultural sciences take theirs from the\nsphere of expressive perception \u2013 and, in the first instance,\nfrom our lived experience in a human community sharing a common system\nof \u201ccultural meanings.\u201d\n\nYet we also have the capacity, in the cultural sciences, to\nextend such meanings beyond their originally local contexts. Whereas\nintersubjective validity in the natural sciences rests on universal\nlaws of nature ranging over all (physical) places and times, an\nanalogous type of intersubjective validity arises in the cultural\nsciences independently of such laws. Although every \u201ccultural\nobject\u201d has its own individual place in (historical) time and\n(geographical-cultural) space, it can still continuously approach a\nuniversal cultural meaning (in history or ethnography) as it is\ncontinually interpreted and reinterpreted from the\nperspective of other times and places. Universal cultural meaning\nthereby emerges only asymptotically, in a way similar to the genetic\nconception of knowledge of the Marburg School (now seen as based on\nthe significative function of thought). Rather than an abstract\nmathematical relation of backwards-directed inclusion, however, we are\nconcerned, in the historical cultural sciences, with a hermeneutical\nrelation of backwards-directed interpretation and reinterpretation\n\u2013 and, as a result, there is no possibility, in these sciences,\nof reliably predicting the future.\n\nWe can further illuminate Cassirer\u2019s evolving attempt to situate\nhimself between Kant and Hegel by considering his evolving\nrelationship to Heidegger. In the 1929 Disputation at Davos Cassirer\nchallenged Heidegger\u2019s radical \u201cfinitism\u201d by\nappealing to the presumed necessary and eternal validity found in both\nthe mathematical sciences and morality. And after the Disputation\nCassirer added five footnotes to Being and Time (1927) in\nThe Phenomenology of Knowledge before its publication, where\nhe suggested that his attempt to begin the Hegelian phenomenology with\nmythical thought rather than ordinary sense perception could also\naddress Heidegger\u2019s concerns. In 1931, however, Cassirer\npublished a review of [Heidegger 1929], which took a different\napproach from his remarks at Davos. Instead of primarily emphasizing\nthe \u201ceternal\u201d validity found in the mathematical sciences,\nCassirer now placed his main emphasis on the ethical and aesthetic\ndimensions of Kant\u2019s thought, as expressed in the Critique\nof Practical Reason (1788) and the Critique of the Power of\nJudgement (1790). His main point was that, whereas the\nTranscendental Analytic of the Critique of Pure\nReason(1781/1787) may indeed be written from the perspective of\nhuman finitude, the rest of Kant\u2019s system embeds this\nperspective within a wider conception of \u201cthe intelligible\nsubstrate of humanity.\u201d\n\n[Cassirer 1931] mirrors his just-completed attempt to embed the\nMarburg genetic conception of knowledge within a wider conception of\nthe development of human culture as a whole. The way in which Cassirer\nsituates his new philosophy of culture with respect to both Hegel and\nHeidegger then illuminates his fundamental divergence from Hegel\n\u2013 as it came to be expressed in Cassirer\u2019s works on\nhistory and culture after he left Germany for good in 1933. By\nbuilding the Marburg conception of knowledge, in his new philosophy of\nculture, on top of the more primitive forms of mythical thought\n[Ausdruckswahrnehmen] and ordinary language\n[Dingwahrnehmen], Cassirer takes himself to have done justice\nto the insights of both Hegel and Heidegger while avoiding both the\ninfinite divine reason of the former and the radical human finitude of\nthe latter. Yet he has now conceded to Heidegger that Kant\u2019s\ntheory of human cognition involves only the notion of potential rather\nthan actual infinity. In particular, Kant\u2019s treatment of the\nregulative use of the ideas of reason from a merely\ntheoretical point of view leaves their actual content quite\nindeterminate. In the case of the idea of transcendental freedom, for\nexample, we are only able to determine it negatively (from a\ntheoretical point of view), as a species of causality that is\nnot bound by the conditions of time-determination governing\nthe phenomenal world.\n\nIn the Critique of Practical Reason, however, Kant asserts\nthat transcendental freedom acquires a determinate content from pure\npractical reason, through our immediate awareness of the\nmoral law as normatively binding on our will (as a fact of reason),\nand that the (practical) objective reality thereby conferred on this\nidea can then be transferred to the ideas of God and Immortality. This\nis because the moral law unconditionally commands us to seek the\nHighest Good \u2013 the realization of the Kingdom of Ends here on\nearth \u2013 which is an infinite task requiring\ninfinite (practical) faith and hope. The resulting divergence\nfrom the indeterminate and merely potential infinity arising within\ntheoretical reason is visible in the famous passage on the starry\nheavens above me and the moral law within me at the end of the\nCritique of Practical Reason, from which Cassirer quotes in\nhis 1931 review of Heidegger. What the Critique of the Power of\nJudgement adds to this conception is then the further idea that\nrigorous mathematical scientific understanding of the phenomenal world\n(\u201cmechanistic\u201d understanding) runs out considerably before\nwe arrive at the history of human culture, so that the future is in\nprinciple open to the possibility of our continuously approximating\nthe Highest Good without limit. But Cassirer, as we have just seen,\nhas now achieved a parallel result though his methodological\ndistinction between the natural and the cultural sciences. He is\nthereby in a position to replace what he takes to be the oppressive\n(speculative) infinity of Hegel\u2019s Absolute Reason with the\nliberating (practical) infinity of our human (practical) reason. It is\nin this way, for Cassirer, that our cultural future always lies open\nand is always up to us.\n6. The Myth of the State\n\nIn the Preface to the third volume of The Philosophy of Symbolic\nForms, the Phenomenology of Knowledge (1929), Cassirer\nexplains that his concept of phenomenology is precisely the\nHegelian one [Cassirer (1929, vi\u2013vii)]: \u201cWhen I speak of a\n\u2018Phenomenology of Knowledge,\u2019 I do not align\nmyself with modern usage, but I go back to the fundamental meaning of\n\u2018phenomenology\u2019 as Hegel established and systematically\ngrounded and justified it. For Hegel phenomenology becomes the\nfundamental presupposition of philosophical knowledge, because he\nrequires of the latter that it comprehend the totality of spiritual\nforms, and because this totality, according to him, can only be made\nvisible in the transition from one form to another. [There follows a\nquote from the Preface to the effect that the individual has a\nright to demand that (philosophical) science provide a ladder by which\nto reach up to it.] It cannot be expressed more sharply that the\nend, the \u2018telos\u2019 of spirit cannot be grasped and expressed\nif one takes it as something self-subsistent, if one takes it as\ndissolved and separated from the beginning and the middle.\nPhilosophical reflection does not set the end against the middle and\nthe beginning in this way, but rather takes all three as integrating\nmoments of a unitary total development.\u201d\n\nThe Preface to the second volume, on Mythical Thought (1925),\ninvokes Hegel in the same vein, while also indicating Cassirer\u2019s\nremaining fundamental disagreement with him. For Hegel [Hegel (GW 9,\n23)]: \u201cScience for its part demands that self-consciousness\nraise itself into this ether, in order that it may live with and for\nscience. Conversely, the individual has the right to demand that\nscience shall at least provide him with a ladder by which to reach to\nthis height, and show it to him in himself. This right is based on the\nabsolute independence which he knows himself to possess in every form\nof knowledge; for in each form, whether it be recognized by science or\nnot, and regardless of what its content may be, it is absolute\nform \u2013 that is, it is the immediate certainty of itself, and, if\nthis term be preferred, it is therefore absolute being.\u201d\n\nCassirer modifies Hegel in 1925 [Cassirer (1925, ix\u2013x)]:\n\u201cSeen in this way, the problem of myth bursts the bounds of\npsychology and psychologism and takes its place in that universal\ndomain of problems which Hegel designated as \u2018phenomenology of\nspirit.\u2019 That myth stands to the universal task of the\nphenomenology of spirit in an internal and necessary relationship can\nbe mediately derived from Hegel\u2019s own conception and\ndetermination of this concept: \u2018The spirit which \u2026 knows\nitself as developed spirit,\u2019 he writes in the preface to the\nPh\u00e4nomenologie des Geistes, \u2018is science.\u2019\n[Thus begins a considerably longer quotation from (GW 9, 22\u20134),\nwhich concludes \u2018Knowledge in its first phase, or immediate\nspirit, is non-spiritual, i.e., sensible\nconsciousness.\u2019] These propositions, in which Hegel\ncharacterizes the relationship of \u2018science\u2019 to sensible\nconsciousness, are valid to the full extent and with full precision\nfor the relationship of knowledge to mythical consciousness. For the\nproper point of departure for all becoming of science, its beginning\nin the immediate, lies not so much in the sphere of sensible intuition\nas in that of mythical [intuition]\u2026 If, therefore, in\naccordance with Hegel\u2019s demand, \u2018science\u2019 is\nsupposed to offer the ladder to natural consciousness that leads to\nitself, then it must set this ladder one more rung lower.\u201d\n\nIn going beyond sensible consciousness to mythical consciousness,\nCassirer emphasizes a non-rational symbolic form as the basis\nof all the rest. This emphasis had its most striking philosophical\npayoff in one of Cassirer\u2019s last works, The Myth of the\nState, which appeared in the year after his death in 1945.\nCassirer had written this work encouraged by his colleagues at Yale,\nas a way in which he could apply his philosophy of symbolic forms to\nthe great calamity of the time \u2013 the rise of National Socialism in\nGermany and the resulting Second World War. Cassirer\u2019s diagnosis\nof this situation is that it depended on the use of modern\ntechnologies of mass communication to awaken, manipulate, and exploit\nthe essentially non-rational mythical functions of thought that are\nalways still present in every human being. Cassirer singles out two\nGerman thinkers, Hegel and Spengler, as contributing especially to the\nNazi glorification of the totalitarian state \u2013 the former less\nculpably as the most important political philosopher in the nineteenth\ncentury background to what Cassirer calls the \u201cmodern political\nmyth,\u201d the latter much more culpably as this myth was just\ncoming into being in the twentieth.\n\nCassirer developed in G\u00f6teborg his characteristic perspective on\nthe relationship between the natural and cultural sciences, which also\nappealed especially to the expressive function of thought. It\nwas in connection with this work that he articulated a pithy defense\nof Kant\u2019s regulative conception of infinitely distant practical\nideals (e.g., the Kingdom of Ends) against what he takes to\nbe the oppressive (speculative) infinity of Hegel\u2019s Absolute\nReason [Cassirer (1939, 28)]: \u201cIn his philosophy of history\nHegel wanted to provide the definitive speculative demonstration that\nreason is substance and infinite power. For this, however, we must,\naccording to him, above all attain the insight that reason is\n\u2018not so powerless as to pass for a mere ideal, a mere\nought.\u2019 This form of proof has become shaky; the\ncritique of the foundations of the Hegelian system has pulled the\nground out from under it. If we turn back from the Hegelian meaning of\nidea to the Kantian, from the idea as \u2018absolute power\u2019\nback to the idea as \u2018infinite problem,\u2019 we must of course\ngive up the speculative optimism of the Hegelian view of history. But,\nat the same time, we thereby also avoid fatalistic pessimism with its\nprophecies and visions of decline [Untergangsprophezeiungen und\nUntergangsvisionen]. [Our] acting again has a free path to decide\nfor itself out of its own force and responsibility, and it knows that\nthe direction and future of culture will depend on the manner of this\ndecision.\u201d\n\nHere one already sees, in the two penultimate sentences, the fateful\njuxtaposition of Hegel and Spengler: the former as philosopher of\nhistory and of right; the latter as the author of The Decline of\nthe West (1918), which can only be called a totalitarian social\ntechnology.\n\nHegel\u2019s historical and political writings should be\ndistinguished from the earlier Phenomenology of Spirit. Hegel\nwas then a creature of the Enlightenment \u2013 albeit at a time later\nthan Kant\u2019s when the aftermath of the French Revolution and the\nNapoleonic wars had begun in earnest along with the Industrial\nRevolution.\n\nThe first topic addressed in Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology is\nconsciousness, beginning with the well-known discussion of\nsense-certainty and the this. The next topic is\nself-consciousness, which begins with the famous discussion\nof mastery and servitude. It here becomes clear that\nthe self-consciousness in question is that of what is sometimes called\n\u201cmodern subjectivity,\u201d focusing on the first-person\nsingular pronoun I \u2013 but equally, in this case, on the\nsecond-person singular you and the first-person plural\nwe. Here Hegel follows in the footsteps of the Fichtean\nconception of recognition. But Hegel also adds an essential element of\nstruggle, conflict, and competition depending on inequalities between\nI and you, or, more generally, among the members of\nany community of self-conscious human beings (we). This\nelement is indebted to Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on the Origin of\nInequality (1755), to which Kant\u2019s conception of\n\u201cunsocial sociability,\u201d introduced in Ideas towards a\nUniversal History with a Cosmopolitan Aim (1784), is also\nindebted. The difference between Kant and Hegel, in this respect, is\nthat such ideas arise only in the context of Kant\u2019s practical\nphilosophy, while they arise at the beginning of the discussion of\nself-consciousness in Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology. Or, to put\nit another way, while Kant distinguishes between theoretical and\npractical reason, only then to build a bridge between them in the\nCritique of the Power of Judgement, Hegel\u2019s discussion\nof self-consciousness in the Phenomenology initiates the\ndevelopment of a unified conception of reason as such, at once both\ntheoretical and practical.\n\nWhat is at issue is the actualization or realization of rational\nconcepts or ideas, as typified, for Kant, by the ideas of God,\nFreedom, and Immortality produced by pure practical reason.\nKant holds that, as a matter of fact (the Fact of Reason), we have\nsuch a faculty, which produces these ideas and also gives them\nmotivating force for us. But there is still always the question of\nwhether we shall actually choose to follow this purely rational\nmotivation, and so Kant develops an elaborate theory of how we can\ncultivate and develop the means for strengthening and supporting it at\nthe expense of motivations to the contrary (always still present due\nto unsocial sociability).\n\nFor Hegel, by contrast, a rational idea is a normative conception or\nstructure, which, to be normative at all, needs to function as a\nnorm (as a law) within some actual human community.\nRational ideas, as such, are actualized or realized in human history,\nso that the questions then becomes one of understanding the\nhistorical-conceptual processes that can lead us towards higher forms\nof consciousness through increasingly comprehensive and coherent\nnormative structures. This leads to the pivotal section on\nspirit in the Phenomenology, where the historical\npart of the exposition reaches a culmination, of sorts, in the\ndiscussion of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, the\nhistorical context wherein Hegel himself is located. And this sets the\nstage for the penultimate discussion of religion as the means for\nsolving the remaining problem of fully internalizing the norms of\nmorality by all members of a human community located within this same\nhistorical context.\n\nThe problem of internalization involves the need to unify the\nuniversal objective laws of morality with the particular individuals\nwho make up the relevant community. These laws must be incorporated,\nthat is, within the subjective consciousness of each individual, and\nHegel interprets the doctrine of the incarnation thusly. In\nparticular, it is within a philosophically enlightened Christianity,\npracticed within a philosophically enlightened religious community,\nthat the divine is incarnated within the lives of human beings. As\nHegel puts it at the end of the section on morality [Hegel\n(GW 9, 362)]: \u201c[I]t is God manifested in the midst of those who\nknow themselves in the form of pure knowledge.\u201d\n\nKant develops an Enlightenment version of moral religion in his\nReligion within the Boundaries of Pure Reason (1793).\nVirtue, for Kant, is an enduring disposition to follow the\nmoral law at the expense of motivation to the contrary, and it is this\ndisposition, in particular, that needs to be cultivated and nurtured\nwithin our moral sentiments. However, since the problem of unsocial\nsociability is the primary obstacle to virtue, we need a social\nsolution to the problem. This solution, for Kant, is an ethical\ncommunity or \u201cethical state\u201d (in contrast to a legal\n\u201cjuridical state\u201d), in which mutual encouragement and\nsupport in the development of the required disposition (rather than\nfear of legal sanctions) is the primary means of achieving the desired\nresult. Such an ethical community is what Kant calls a\n\u201cchurch.\u201d And he goes on to say that we must look to the\nhistory of religion to trace the development of such communities,\nasserts (not surprisingly) that Christianity (through the doctrine of\nChrist as the redeemer) is the best we have so far, and concludes,\nfinally, that only the regulative ideal of a universal church\nembracing all of humanity \u2013 a church of reason \u2013 can fully\nserve the goal of developing perfect, and therefore universal\nvirtue.\n\nKant and Hegel are not so very different in their Enlightenment\nambitions. They are both concerned with universal normative principles\nand the actualization of these principles in existing human\ncommunities. Moreover, they both find a culmination of this process in\nwhat they take to be the best form of religion of the\ntime \u2013 Christianity, and, in particular, Lutheranism \u2013 which\nonly needs to be fully rationalized and universalized in accordance\nwith Enlightenment demands. The difference between the two, once\nagain, is that, while Kant attempts to meet these demands by sharply\ndistinguishing among different faculties of the mind \u2013 in this\ncase, theoretical and practical reason \u2013 between which he then\nbuilds a bridge, Hegel attempts to meet these same demands by\narticulating a unified conception of reason as such, at once both\ntheoretical and practical.\n\nIn the case of Cassirer, by contrast, although he is certainly a\nfollower and champion of the Enlightenment, he is by no means a\nthinker of the Enlightenment itself. He is instead a creature\nof the twentieth century, confronted with forms of science, and also\nof socio-political organization, technology, warfare, and much else,\nwhich could not have been envisaged by either Kant or Hegel. Moreover,\nthe unprecedented horrors of the first half of the twentieth century\nput Cassirer in a very different moral universe in which no religious\nor cultural tradition could simply be taken for granted. This is clear\nin Cassirer\u2019s discussion of religion at the end of Mythical\nThought, which, in contrast to both Kant and Hegel, ranks art\nrather than religion as the highest development of the expressive\nfunction of symbolic meaning. We must, in the end, acknowledge that\nCassirer\u2019s discussion of myth sheds a bright light on one of the\nmost important problems of his time, namely, the rise of the\ntechnologically driven totalitarian state \u2013 a problem that\ncontinues increasingly to threaten us even today.\n",
