    "preamble": "\n\nHenry Habberley Price, who published as H. H. Price, was born in 1899.\nFrom 1935 to 1959 he was Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford\nUniversity. Price was a major figure in his lifetime well-known\nespecially for the \u201cclarity and elegance of style\u201d, which,\naccording to Martha Kneale (1996: xix), make his works readable in\nspite of changing fashions in philosophy. Many people\u2019s\nacquaintance nowadays with Price\u2019s philosophical work derives\nfrom his being a target in Austin\u2019s (1962) famous attack on the\nsense-datum theory. This restricted acquaintance with his output is\none reason that Price has been ignored in recent philosophy.\n\nMainstream philosophy neglected him after the Second World War,\nperhaps partly because, when articulating his ideas, he mainly engaged\nwith philosophers of the past, such as Locke and Hume. His thought\nwas, however, valued by fellow philosophers such as Broad, Moore,\nAyer, and generations of his students at Oxford, including Sellars,\nArmstrong, and Anscombe.\n\nAlthough Price is seen mainly as a philosopher of perception, only two\nof his six books are about perception and he had a major influence,\nalso publishing many articles, on a variety of topics, including some\nwe cannot focus on here, e.g., our evidence of other minds (1938;\n1930b: 195) and psychical research (1940c; 1953b; 1972; 1995; an\ninterest he claims to share with Neo-Platonists [1968a: 447]). We can\nonly provide a sketch of his rich contributions. After briefly\nsketching his life (\u00a71), we discuss his philosophy\u2019s\ngeneral features (\u00a72), contributions to the studies of perception\n(\u00a73), properties (\u00a75.1), recognition (\u00a75), belief\n(\u00a76), religious belief (\u00a76.8), his revival and serious study\nof Hume (\u00a74), and some remarkable anticipations (\u00a77).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nPrice was born on 17 May 1899 and died on 26 November 1984. He was\nborn in Neath, a small, then industrial town in South Wales, and\neducated at the famous public school Winchester College, whose\nstudents are called Wykehamists. He studied Literae Humaniores\n(\u201cGreats\u201d, covering Ancient History, Ancient Literature,\nand Philosophy) at New College, Oxford, where the cleverest\nWykehamists go, both colleges being founded by William of Wykeham in\nthe fourteenth century. He had the perfect Wykehamist career: being\nWykeham Professor of Logic from the remarkably young age of 35 in 1935\nuntil his retirement in 1959 (Harrison 1993: 479). He had a very\ndistinguished academic career (Quinton 1995a: 676; 1995b: 252),\nreceiving many honours and prestigious invitations and was known as an\nexcellent philosophy lecturer (Mitchell 2009: 45\u201346). He was a\nconstructive philosopher, attempting constantly to develop approaches\nand not satisfied with the demolition of extant views. Famously, Price\nis credited with punching a hole in the isolation of Oxford philosophy\nin the inter-war period by discussing philosophy with Moore and Broad\nin Cambridge, especially on perception, and importing the new approach\nto philosophy developed there with, in Quinton\u2019s (1995a: 675)\nwords, \u201cstyle, rigour, and authority\u201d (see also 1995c:\n708; Mabbott 1986: 78). He was extremely polite, usually trying to\nformulate the views of other philosophers and students, especially if\nhe disagreed with them, in the best way possible (Price [1945: 2]\ndiscusses this in his balanced response to critics of clarificatory\nphilosophy). For example, he finds some merit in the\ntraditional imagistic model of thought (1951\u20131952; 1969). His\nimpact on students was significant. Anscombe recalls, \u201cof all\nthe people I heard at Oxford, he was the one who excited my respect;\nthe one I found worth listening to\u201d (1981: viii; Mac Cumhaill\n& Wiseman 2022: 76f). He supervised several philosophers who went\non to have distinguished careers themselves, including Wilfrid Sellars\n(for some reflections, see Sellars 1975: 285) and D.M. Armstrong.\n2. Four General Features\n\nThere are at least four general features of Price\u2019s approach to\nphilosophy.\n2.1 Following the Evidence of Experience\n\nFirst, with any issue he simply aims to follow the evidence, wherever\nit leads. Thus, if the clear evidence is that there are sense-data\nwith a certain character, then that must be accepted and incorporated\ninto one\u2019s theory of the world. And if the character of your\nexperiences means that you cannot be a body then that must also be\naccepted. He arrives with few metaphysical prejudices.\n\nHowever, Price\u2019s understanding of evidence is revealing. For\ninstance, his novel arguments against both materialism and Cartesian\nforms of dualism come down to their conflict with evidence\n\u201cdiscovered by straightforward empirical methods\u201d (1953b:\n45), for such phenomena as unconscious processes, those he calls\n\u201csupernormal cognition\u201d (such as telepathy), and the\ndivided self (especially 1953b: 43\u201347) (for discussion: Dilley\n1995: xviif; Martin 2000: 222).\n\nAlso, the evidence relevant to philosophical questions goes beyond\nwhat the sciences tell us: Price famously claims (1953a: 2ff),\nemploying a pattern of argument that he repeatedly uses (more examples\nbelow, e.g.,\n \u00a72.3),\n that, since our scientific beliefs depend on the beliefs that our\nexperiences give us, the scientific picture of the world cannot\nundermine those basic beliefs, because unless we can rely on those\nbasic beliefs we cannot rely on the science constructed on their basis\n(see also 1930a: 34\u201335). An important theme is to examine the\nexperiences upon which our beliefs are based and to inquire into the\nways they justify our beliefs. Evidence from experience is more\nimportant and basic for Price than scientific evidence.\n\nQuinton (1973: 195) attributes Price\u2019s argument\u2019s\ninfluence as the source of the discredit of\n\u201cscientifically-based reasoning\u201d about perception, at\nleast until Smart, Armstrong, and Pitcher reanimated such arguments in\nthe 1960s (for discussion: Bradie 1976: 42ff). Price declares, from\nour perspective somewhat oddly, that the investigation into perception\nis not a question for science: science does not tell us what seeing\nand touching are, but merely what their causes are (1932: 2). Price\ncontrasts physiological investigations, that is to say science, and\n\u201cimmanent or phenomenological\u201d ones, which is to say\nphilosophy (1932: 10; for discussion: Hamlyn 1961: 173, 178). Thus,\nphilosophy uniquely contributes to knowledge and evidence via his type\nof phenomenological investigations; it is no mere handmaiden to\nscience. He also articulates another role for philosophy independent\nof \u201cthe progress of empirical research\u201d, where\n\u201cgreat problems\u201d, \u201cpuzzles\u201d, are \n\n\ndissolved, rather than solved, by dragging to light ambiguities,\nconfusions, and unconscious preconceptions [\u2026and] by inventing\na more flexible and less equivocal terminology. (1940b: 36; see also\n1945: 4)\n\n2.2 Empiricism\n\nHe does, however, reiterate a commitment to empiricism, arguing that\nit is \u201cbeneficial to mankind\u201d and a \u201csocial\nphenomenon of great importance\u201d (1940b: 8\u20139). By\n\u201cempiricism\u201d, he seems to mean two things:\n\nFirst, if we understand a notion (or concept) then we should be able\nto recognise when it applies should the right experiences present\nthemselves. Price (1953a: especially 78, 117, 136, 231, 260, 270,\n355\u2013358) extensively defends his view that understanding,\nconcepts, and ideas themselves are recognitional capacities of\n\u201cconscious creature[s], human or animal\u201d (1959c: 483; for\ndiscussion: Burgener 1957: 157; Warnock [1995: 756] emphasises its\ncentrality for Price). Price links this to the much-discussed slogan,\nwhich he accepts, that to understand a claim is to know what would be\nthe case if it is true (1953a: 208\u2013209; 1938: 442). A key\ncontribution of his is that he thinks that this kind of knowledge\nincorporates a recognitional capacity. \n\nBut second, the test for a theory or conviction lies ultimately in how\nit engages with experience. Regarding religious belief, he recommends\nthat you should try it out and see how the experience of doing so\nstrikes you (1964c: 25\u201325; 1969: 455\u2013488; see\n \u00a76.8).\n He sums up the empiricist programme which he endorses thus: \n\n\nto show that all ideas are ultimately cashable by impressions, that is\nby data which we are acquainted with in sense or introspection, or in\nany other sort of acquaintance there may be [such as, controversially,\n\u201cmystical experience\u201d]. (1940b: 11\u201312) \n\n\nHe also writes: \n\n\nAn empiricist is a man who says \u201cit all comes down to\nostensive definition in the end.\u201d (1959c: 483)\n\n\nAlso, Hume and Locke are his two main philosophical heroes; see Kneale\n1996: xix. In 1959 (1959c: 481), Price writes \u201cI am really just\nan old-fashioned British empiricist\u201d (agreeing with Burgener\n1957), and \u201c[Thinking and Experience, 1953a] protests\nagainst the transformation of the empiricist epistemology into a\nlinguistic epistemology\u201d.\n2.3 Commonsense\n\nThird, Price defends the authority of commonsense as \u201cthe\nstarting-point of all philosophy\u201d (1930b: 202), extending\nMoore\u2019s (1925) defence (see 1930b: 198f), generally using it as\na methodological touchstone. He frequently objects to criticism of\ncommon thinking from science: because science relies on\nordinary thinking and experience, such criticisms undermine themselves\n(e.g., 1930b: 198; 1932: chapter 2). He also identifies this\n\u201cfallacy\u201d in anti-commonsense, genetic debunking arguments\nand Bergsonian arguments that commonsense is practically biased\n(1930a: 34\u201335). Furthermore, Price tends to say that our\ncognitive practices and nature simply have to be accepted for what\nthey are. Of paramount importance is the existence of what he calls\nthe \u201cinner life\u201d, involving toothaches, dreams, and mental\nimages (1959c: 481\u2013482; 1964c: 7; 1969: 295; he cites this as\none of Wittgenstein\u2019s 1953 main themes, too; see also Kneale\n1994: xvii). According to him, the contemporary attack on the\n\u201cinner life\u201d has \u201cgone a long way towards a kind of\n\u201cdehumanisation\u201d of man\u201d (1959c: 482).\n\nFinally, commonsense guides which topics he focuses on. For instance,\nhis famous discussion of the metaphysics of properties focuses on\nAristotelian universals in things (in rebus) rather than\nPlatonic universals anterior to things (ante rem) not because\nhe thinks the latter is unimportant but because \u201cit is more\nremote from common sense and our ordinary everyday habits of\nthought\u201d (1953a: 10; this responds to Findlay\u2019s 1954: 71\ncriticism).\n2.4 Metaphysical Neutrality\n\nFourth, despite his major contributions to metaphysics, Price often\nmaintains metaphysical neutrality. For instance, he provides the most\nworked-out and discussed account of resemblance nominalism in the\nliterature (1953a: chapter 1), but ultimately stays neutral about\nwhether realism about (Aristotelian) universals (1953a: 10\u201314)\nis true.\n \u00a75.1\n discusses this extensively. He is also metaphysically neutral about\nthe nature of sense-data. Generally, his metaphysical neutralism takes\nthis form: First, he finds that the empirical evidence points us to\nthe existence of such things as sense-data, mental phenomena\n(including psychical phenomena), concepts, dispositions to recognise\nconcepts, etc. However, second, the empirical evidence does not\nadjudicate between whether sense-data are physical, mental, or\nneither, or whether our recognitional dispositions track resemblances\nor universals, etc. So, he neither affirms nor denies any of these\nmetaphysical accounts.\n\nAlso, Price (1940a) articulates two forms of Neo-Humeanism about\nexternal objects which are essentially neutralist; see\n \u00a7\u00a74.3\u20134.4\n below.\n\nTo be clear: he is no across-the-board metaphysical neutralist. For\ninstance, unlike his positivist colleagues (e.g., Ayer), he\ndoesn\u2019t think that metaphysics is nonsense. He is very critical\nof declarations of nonsense (1939 [1995: 26]; 1945: 30\u201331). He\ndefends positive ontological and metaphysical positions, e.g., the\nontological reality of sense-data and of dispositions, when\nhis evidence allows him to. But when his evidence is inconclusive, he\nstays neutral.\n\nWhen defending sense-data, Price (1932: 19\u201320) stresses what he\ncalls the neutrality of the admissions of sense-data in his\nsense. There is no immediate commitment to their persistence\nconditions, their privacy or publicity, the kind of entity they are,\nnor to their origins: the nature of sense-data is not given to us.\nUnderstanding them for instance as \u201csensible species\u201d\n(some Scholastics), \u201cimpressions\u201d (Hume), or\n\u201csensa\u201d (Broad) begs the question, for they bring in the\nassumption that their nature is physical, mental, or neither,\nrespectively (see also Murray 1933: 507f). Thus, he characteristically\nneither accepts nor denies any of these further metaphysical\nassumptions: they go beyond what he takes to be the evidence. Price\n(1927: 110) also compares not being immediately aware of the\nnature of sense-data with not being immediately aware of\nphysical objects. This neutrality-until-further-examination regarding\n\u201csense-data\u201d in effect places Price close to Moore\u2019s\n(1903; 1957[1965]) way of introducing sense-data (see also Lean 1953:\n2\u20133; Bauer 1967: 8\u20139; Crane 2000: 175\u2013177). In\nsummary, Price puts it thus: \n\n\nSo far as the main theme of this book goes, it really does not matter\nhow we answer them [\u2026 i.e. the questions about] the\nnature of sense-data. (1932: 104)\n\n\nDespite this metaphysical neutrality about the nature of\nsense-data, he is not ontologically neutral. He argues that sense-data\nare what are given to us and what are sensed in perceptual\nexperiences, which we obviously have: we simply have to accept their\nexistence. And, they have whatever nature they must have to\nplay the role in experience that they do, a role that allows them (a)\nto be related to the material things which we suppose are in the\nworld, and (b) to enable our consciousness of those material\nthings.\n\nHowever, even his metaphysical neutrality is not complete: it does not\nextend to denying metaphysical features that are phenomenogically\ngiven (recall\n \u00a72.1);\n for instance, it is to misunderstand visual sense-data to take them\nto be two-dimensional: \u201cIt is a plain phenomenological fact that\nvisual fields have the property of depth\u201d (1954a:\nvii\u2013viii; for discussion: Jackson 1977: 102; Crane 1992a: 15;\nBaldwin 1992: 183\u2013184; Martin 1992: 198). Price\u2019s\nmetaphysical neutralism, however, doesn\u2019t underplay metaphysical\nspeculation\u2019s importance for philosophy and science: he\nwrites,\n\n\nIf people accuse us of being speculative and even\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d we must refuse to be frightened. We must\npostulate unverifiable entities and processes if we cannot get on\nwithout them. The task of philosophical deflation, of\nremoving unnecessary metaphysical entities, comes at the end of a\nscience\u2019s progress, not at the beginning; if such writers as\nHume and Mach and the modern Logical Positivists had lived in the\nearly seventeenth century, Physics would never have got itself\nstarted. (1939 [1995: 26])\n\n3. Perception\n\nPrice\u2019s fame rests most on his views on perception, expressed in\nhis first book Perception (1932) and many articles (1924;\n1926a; 1926b; 1927; 1928; 1941; 1943\u20131944; 1951; 1952a; 1952b;\n1956; 1959a; 1959b; 1960; 1964a). In his most cited passage, he\nwrites, \u201cwhen I see a tomato there is much that I can doubt.\n\u2026 but that something is red and round then and there I cannot\ndoubt\u201d (1932: 3; Robinson 1994: 32 calls this an expression of\nthe \u201cPhenomenal Principle\u201d; see also Martin\u2019s (2000:\n218ff) \u201cActualism\u201d; for discussion: Crane 2000:\n176\u2013177; Raleigh 2009: 64\u201365; Fish 2010: 5; O\u2019Shea\n2007: 109\u2013110; Johnston 2018: 175f; Locatelli 2014: 147f). I\ncannot, according to Price, doubt that there is present to my\nconsciousness at that time a genuinely red thing with a certain shape;\nit is just obvious and \u201cquite plain that I am acquainted with an\nactual instance of [here: redness]\u201d (1932: 63; for discussion:\nSnowdon 1992: 73). This thing is (directly) sensed by me,\ngiven to me, and he calls it a sense-datum (this is\ncalled the \u201csense-datum inference\u201d by Chisholm 1963: 102;\nO\u2019Shea 2007: 141 argues that Price along with Russell relies on\nan \u201cact/object\u201d model of sensory cognition here; however,\nsee Price 1969: 363\u2013365 on the act-object distinction).\n\nPrice claims immediately that our core beliefs about the world depend\non our visual and tactual experiences which have the\njust-characterised structure. However, he is at pains to say both (i)\nwhat he does not take to be indubitable (1932: 3\u20134;\n1924: 20\u201324) and (ii) that \u201cour data, the undeniable facts\nwith which he must begin, are never mere sense-data\u201d (1924: 24),\nfor they also involve non-sensuous data. He has sometimes been\ncredited with the view that our knowledge of sense-data and their\nfeatures is indubitable\u2014for instance, Grossmann (1990:\n113\u2013114) criticises Price here by arguing that we can indeed be\nmistaken about the properties of our impressions, something revealed\nby closer inspection. However, Price insists (e.g., 1924: 21) that one\nmay make \u201cmistakes of detail\u201d, e.g., whether a sense-datum\nis uniformly one shade of red, but one cannot mistake a colour for a\nsound or a smell.\n\nThe famous tomato-passage\u2019s crucial move is that at least\nsome of the genuine properties the given item has are obvious to\nus. This allows us to fix further properties of the sense-data in\nlight of what we can determine about the external world. \n\nPrice (1932: ch. 2) identifies two theoretical goals for sense-data\ntheories. It is clear that for a subject to have the complex beliefs\nabout the material world that we have, the subject must do more than\nsimply sense or be acquainted with sense-data. Further mental\nprocesses which he calls \u201cperceptual consciousness\u201d (1932:\n25) are required. One task is to describe fully what the components of\nperceptual consciousness are; another is to say what it is for a\nsense-datum to \u201cbelong to\u201d a material object,\n\u201cbelonging to\u201d being what Price, following Moore (Price\n1932: vi), calls the relation between a material object and a\nsense-datum when sensing that sense-datum counts as perceiving that\nmaterial object.\n3.1 Criticisms of Theories of Sense-Data: Na\u00efve Realism\n\nPrice defines and criticises a theory he calls \u201cNa\u00efve\nRealism\u201d, so-called because it is a \u201cnatural\u201d place\nto start, not because this is what na\u00efve or ordinary people think\n(1932: 26). This Na\u00efve Realism has two sides: First, perceptual\nconsciousness, in Price\u2019s sense, is equivalent to knowledge that\nthere is a material object to which the current sense-datum belongs.\nSecond, for a sense-datum (which is visual or tactual) to belong to an\nobject is for it to be part of the surface of the object. (The\ncentrality in this debate of the notion of a surface comes from\nMoore\u2019s discussion, e.g., 1942: 649\u2013659.)\n\nPrice proposes two versions of what he calls the Argument from\nIllusion (1932: 27): one Phenomenological and the other, Causal. The\nfirst is Price\u2019s version of the traditional argument, based on\nits familiar examples of illusion. The second is an argument aiming to\nshow that visual and tactual sense-data exist only if there are\nprocesses occurring in the subject (say, neural processes), which\nmeans that, since the surfaces themselves (and the objects to which\nthey belong) exist, whatever is going on in the subject, they cannot\nbe the same thing as the sense-datum. He proposes that the causal\nargument is unpersuasive, but the phenomenological one works. (For\nfurther discussion: 1956; also Hamlyn 1970: 147ff; Crane 2005:\n\u00a71.2.)\n3.2 Austin on Price: seeing versus what one can doubt & the Theory of Appearing\n\nIn his famous book Sense and Sensibilia (1962), Austin\nfocuses on Price\u2019s argument for sense-data almost exclusively as\npresented in (1932: chs. 1\u20132), though this discussion plays only\na minor role next to Ayer, the book\u2019s real anti-hero (Snowdon\n2014: 167 queries Austin\u2019s motivations here; Rowe 2023: ch. 25).\nAlthough the current consensus seems to be that Austin\u2019s\ncriticisms of Price were successful (e.g., Hamlyn 1970: 148; though,\ne.g., Harris 1987: 70 remarks that Austin misrepresents Price and\nAyer), this is not true when Austin shifts his focus to perceptual\nknowledge.\n\nAustin says:\n\n\nPrice is more seriously interested than is Ayer in the actual facts\nabout perception, and pays more attention to them\u2014but still, it\nis worth noticing that, after raising the initial question,\n\u201cWhat is it to see something?\u201d, his very next\nsentence runs, \u201cWhen I see a tomato there is much that I can\ndoubt\u201d. This suggests that he too is really interested, not\nso much in what seeing is, as in what one can\u2019t doubt.\n(1962: 104\u20135)\n\n\nAustin overlooks Price\u2019s most important point here, which is\nthat he is certain that what is given to him is something red, that\nis, something with that property. Price\u2019s interest here is what\nthe real character of the component of experience is, and his remark\ndoes not reveal his more general interest in doubt and certainty.\nPrice needs some genuine feature so that in the light of what he can\nalso know about the surrounding objects he can argue that the given\nitems are not surfaces of external things. The main problem with\nPrice\u2019s claim is that he has no good response to the\ncounter-proposal that all he can really be certain of is that the\npresented thing looks red. Despite talking about what he can\ndoubt, Price\u2019s main concern is what seeing involves.\n\nHe does elsewhere respond to what he calls the Theory of Appearing\n(1932: 61\u201365; for discussion: Langsam 1997: 36; Murray 1933:\n508\u2013513), which he takes to be a modification of na\u00efve\nrealism, and which in effect says that when we see the tomato it is\nnot certain that there is a red thing, but it is merely certain that\nthere appears to be a red thing. Clearly, this suggestion\nundermines the central argument from illusion, since the external\nobject can also count as appearing to be red; so no non-identity claim\ncan be generated (1932: 62).\n\nPrice\u2019s main response is that either \u201cX looks\nred\u201d means \u201cX presents a red sense-datum\u201d in\nwhich case there is a red sense-datum (1932: 63; 1964a: 15ff), or,\n\u201cderivatively\u201d (1964a: 15), it means something like\n\u201cI am inclined to think that X is red\u201d or\n\u201cthere is some probability (though not certainty) that X\nis red\u201d or is used to avoid being accused of being mistaken if\nX isn\u2019t red, in which cases it does not capture an\nexperiential fact (1932: 62\u201365; 1964a: 12\u201315). The obvious\nproblem with this objection is why those are the only alternative ways\nto understand looks judgements. However, see 1952a: passim,\nwhere he discusses appearing further, Quinton\u2019s (1952:\n238\u2013246) detailed criticisms, and Grossmann\u2019s (1965:\n35\u201338) sympathetic use of Price\u2019s response.\n3.3 Criticisms of the Causal Theory\n\nPrice (1932: ch. 4) scrutinises the so-called Causal theory which he\nthinks of as more or less equivalent to traditional\nrepresentationalism. Price\u2019s initial statement of the theory is:\n\n\n(1)\na sense-datum belongs to an object O if O\ncauses that sense-datum, and \n(2)\nperceptual consciousness is, fundamentally, an inference\nfrom effect to cause. \n\n\nTo make\n (2)\n consistent with our sense that in ordinary circumstances we do not\narrive at our convictions about the environment by inference, Price\nreads it as claiming that originally we form our convictions by such\ncausal inferences, but after that, dispositions are generated which\nmake the process automatic (1932: 68f). Price (1932: 70f) also\nproposes that\n (1)\n be replaced by the more complex analysis of \u201cbelonging\u201d\nby being a \u201cvarying or differential\u201d causal condition,\nmeaning that a perceiver\u2019s visual sense-data would be different\nif these causal conditions were different, in contrast to their\nstanding causal conditions (e.g., there being a source of light and an\neye in a certain state) which are perhaps \u201cnecessary to all the\nvisual sense-data alike, [but] do not wholly determine any of\nthem\u201d (1932: 70f; for discussion: Jackson 1977: 168). Famously,\nGrice (1961: 142ff) criticises the more complex analysis, requiring\ninstead that the perceived object contributes to the occurrence of the\nsense-datum (1961: 143; see also Kim 1977: 612; Sosa 2015:\n11\u201313).\n\nPrice himself moves quickly from\n (1)\n and concentrates on the revised version of\n (2).\n He allows that it is reasonable to infer that there are unsensed\ncauses of our sense-data (1932: 70\u201374), but what is the\ncharacter of those causes? Can a backward causal argument reveal that?\nIn answer, Price formulates five methods of argument that can be\ndeveloped. In outline, the methods isolate types of independence in\nfeatures of the given to ground inferences about the degrees of\nindependence in their postulated causes. Price\u2019s critical\nresponse is to suggest that the most such backward arguments can\nestablish is the existence of \u201cNon-sensible\u201d (1932: 74)\nsomethings-or-other with a plurality of aspects.\n3.4 Perceptual Consciousness: Perceptual Acceptance\n\nPrice (1932: ch. 6) discusses what he calls \u201cperceptual\nconsciousness\u201d, that is, what the perceiver takes to be there.\nHis example is when a perceiver takes in that there is a tree in front\nof them. Price\u2019s method is to describe as accurately as he can\nthe component in perception that he calls perceptual\nacceptance. His project is a phenomenological analysis (Passmore\n[1957: 255] ties Price\u2019s work with Husserl\u2019s). Acceptance\ndoes not count as knowledge, since it can be present when the\npercipient is mistaken, as when a drunk hallucinates a large pink\nrabbit that frightens him. It isn\u2019t belief either but perhaps\nthe \u201cabsence of disbelief\u201d (1932: 142), since, according\nto him (following Cook Wilson; for discussion: Passmore 1957:\n254\u2013255), beliefs are a state of mind which must be arrived at\nby inference from evidence that the subject recognises is less than\nconclusive. Price says that there is no inference or weighing of\nevidence in basic perceptual consciousness. Both these claims, that it\ncannot be knowledge or belief, rest on questionable assumptions.\n\nO\u2019Shea (2007: 210) takes Price to be relating\n\u201c(non-propositional) sensing and (propositional)\nperceiving\u201d here. Martin (2000: 210) claims that Price\u2019s\nperceptual acceptance is what he calls \u201cthe intentionality of\nperceptual experience\u201d and takes Price explicitly to consider it\na \u201cbelief-like state of mind\u201d. Butchvarov (1979: 93) calls\nPrice\u2019s perceptual consciousness, \u201csingling out in\nperception of a material thing, which may but need not\nexist\u201d.\n\nPrice\u2019s analysis attempts to capture the nature of very basic\nperceptual acceptance: as subjects\u2019 experiences grow this sets\nup in the subjects dispositions for the sensing of a certain type of\nsense-datum to produce acceptance of much more complex claims as to\nwhat is there. These dispositions represent part of the subject\nlearning about the world. Price is claiming that these are simply\nacceptances with richer content.\n\nPrice argues that acceptance is not the generation of a bodily\ndisposition relating to the environment, for it is also related\nto an ability to report what is there, not simply to adopt a\nbehavioural response\u2014nor is it reducible to an emotional\nresponse (1932: 156ff). Rather, acceptance is a basic attitude,\ninvolving concepts, which our psychological nature endows us with\n(1932: 168f). His work on perception doesn\u2019t explain what it is\nfor these states to involve concepts, nor what this explains: we are\nsimply set up to form attitudes when undergoing sensings of\nsense-data, though he holds that the most basic concepts involved in\nacceptance are innate and not derived from experience. However, later\n(1953a), he develops a theory of concepts as recognitional capacities,\nwhich suggests that perceptual acceptance involves a recognitional\ncapacity developed by perceiving and derived from experience.\n3.5 Less Basic Forms of Perceptual Consciousness & the Principle of Confirmability\n\nPrice (1932: ch. 7) discusses less basic forms of perceptual\nconsciousness, roughly, ones which occur after more worldly\nexperiences. Consider a subject who has looked around a tree sensing a\nsequence of sense-data. In these circumstances the subject has what\nPrice calls a settled conviction about the existence and character of\nthe tree. This is not mere acceptance but a new attitude which has\nsurvived challenges and counts as rational belief, passing Cook\nWilson\u2019s conditions that Price relied on when arguing that the\ninitial cases are not cases of belief. Then he asks: How can simple\nsensings of sense-data validate this new attitude? His response:\ngathering the relevant experiences simply does count as a rational\nconfirmation of the claims in question. This yields Price\u2019s\nPrinciple of Confirmability:\n\n\nClearly we shall have to say that the existence of a particular visual\nor tactual sense-datum is prima facie evidence (1) for the existence\nof a material thing such that this sense-datum belongs to it, (2) for\nthe possession by this thing of a front surface of a certain general\nsort. (1932: 185)\n\n\nTo Price, this principle is evident, not derivable from anything more\nbasic, but equally not refutable by any considerations (for\ndiscussion: Lemos 2004: 136\u2013137). Crucially, although our\nexperiences confirm the claims about the material objects around us,\nthey don\u2019t yield knowledge that there are material objects: the\nconfirmation doesn\u2019t amount to absolute certainty. However, we\ndo have knowledge that these experiences are confirmatory ones. We\ncannot ask for more than that.\n3.6 Price\u2019s Theory of Sense-Data & their Relations\n\nPrice (1932: ch. 8) analyses \u201cbelonging to\u201d, the phrase he\nuses for the relation between a sense-datum s which is sensed\nand an object M where sensing s amounts to perceiving\nM. Here and now you are seeing a screen and you are sensing a\nsense-datum which therefore \u201cbelongs to\u201d the screen. He\nseems initially to want an analysis of what is involved in a\nsense-datum (the sensed one) being a member of a group of sense-data\nwhich has a relation to M. We are to envisage, say, walking\ntowards a table and what the evolving sequence of sense-data would be.\nVery roughly, there would be what Price calls a gradual transformation\nin the successive sense-data \u201cin respect of colour, shape, size,\nand position in the field of view\u201d (1932: 208). His central\ninsight is that, as we might put it, moving towards and around the\nobject M, certain groups of sense-data constitute a\nthree-dimensional solid shape (1932: 217\u2013229).\n\nBut how are material things that occupy the spatial world related to\nthis system of families of sense-data (1932: ch. 9)? First, Price\nrejects phenomenalism, which identifies material things with these\nfamilies (1932: 275\u2013282). His basic objection is that material\nthings occupy space and are present, often doing things, such as\nreflecting light or deflecting air, etc. But according to\nphenomenalism, all the presence of the family comes down to is that\nsense-data would be sensed if things were different. Clearly this sort\nof fact cannot itself deflect light rays. Price, therefore, has to\nrecognise \u201ctwo distinct\u201d entities (1932: 293). There is\nthe \u201cfamily\u201d of actual and obtainable sense-data\nand the physical object. Price claims that we are ignorant of\nthe intrinsic nature of the physical objects themselves and have to\nconceptualise them as bearers of causal powers (1932: 294\u2013300;\nalso 1927: 110). A table, for instance, is a \u201cfamily [viz. of\nsensibilia] together with the physical object which is coincident with\nit\u201d (1932: 301). His analysis of when a sense-datum s\nbelongs to an external object M is this:\n\n(1)\ns is a member of a family of sense-data F,\n(2)\nthere is a physical occupant O with which F is\ncoincident,\n(3)\nM consists of F and O in conjunction.\n\n\nIt is unclear exactly what \u201ccoincidence\u201d strictly means.\nFor instance, O and F, according to Price (1932: 252),\ncannot have the same position in space for the sense in which F\nhas a position in space is radically different from the sense in which\nO does. \n\nFinally, when considering the causal origins of sense-data, Price\ncontrasts (i) \u201cvertical\u201d causation, the causal process of\nsense-data genesis, with (ii) \u201chorizontal\u201d causation,\nother causal interactions between things in the world. Price claims\nthat our basic knowledge of objects does not depend on or presuppose\nour belief in vertical causation. Rather, we attain knowledge of\nvertical causation from already established knowledge of objects\n(1932: 311\u2013313 sketches this knowledge-acquisition). He\nconsiders this an objection to the causal theory of perception. But it\nis so only if that theory is defined as requiring that our basic,\nworldly knowledge is based on causal reasoning, which need not be\ncoupled with a causal model of perception.\n\nPrice also argues that phenomenalism cannot accommodate real vertical\ncausation by physical objects as they understand them. Idealists and\nphenomenalists, however, would generally agree and look for other\nexplanations of experience (e.g., God). The real causal generators in\nthe external world are, Price argues, not the complex two-component\nthings, which he previously (1932: ch. 8) claimed corresponded to our\nconception of material things, but, rather, are the real physical\noccupants with their causal powers. He writes: \u201csense-data are\ncausally dependent on the states and the changes of physical\noccupants\u201d (1932: 319). Price avoids confronting the natural\nquestion as to where this leaves the idea that material things cannot\nbe identified with the physical occupants, since, it now seems,\neverything that an external thing does will be done by the physical\noccupant. \n\nPrice ends up with a form of dualism, with physical occupants and\nthings of another sort which house sense-data occurrences, whose\nnature is radically under-described. For he claims that the events\nwhich are the occurrences of sense-data cannot themselves be events in\nthe physical occupants. So, strikingly, he defends a conception of\nobjects as two-sided compounds of a physical occupant of space with\ncausal properties and a family of sensibilia.\n3.7 Possible Criticisms: Sellars against the Given\n\nMany under the influence of Sellars might object to Price\u2019s\nnotion of the given. Price belongs with the group of British\nphilosophers whom Sellars (1956 [1997]) discusses, along with Ayer,\nRyle, and earlier Empiricists. But Sellars, who was a pupil of Price\n(see, e.g., Crane 2013: 246; deVries 2005: 4\u20135; Triplett 2023:\n1), doesn\u2019t single out Price for criticism, instead positively\nappealing to Price in other contexts (e.g., Price\u2019s [1953a: 73]\nunderstanding of abstract thinking, \u201cthinking in absence\u201d\n[1956 [1997: 65]], and Price [1953a: 185\u2013187] on the\n\u201cthermometer view\u201d [1956 [1997: 66]]). Overall, Sellars\ndoesn\u2019t clearly oppose Price\u2019s notion of the given. Most\nrecently, Triplett (2023: 6) argues that (a) Sellars\u2019 argument\ndoesn\u2019t touch Price\u2019s sense-datum theory, as Sellars\nrelies on understanding sensing as entailing propositional\nknowledge; (b), nor does Hicks\u2019s (2020: 12) reconstruction of\nSellars\u2019 argument, according to which sensing requires\nconceptualisation, since Price explicitly understands sensing as a\ndirect acquaintance with sense-data. See also Triplett 2014; Crane\n2013: 229, 246; O\u2019Shea (2007: 109\u2013111, 112\u2013113)\nargues that Price (1932: 7) anticipates Sellars\u2019s objections\nagainst the given.\n\nHis (1969: 50\u201371) later developments of\nknowledge-by-acquaintance take it to be knowledge of items, say a\nplace, a person, or something abstract like a poem, which we ascribe\nin the form \u201cS knows X\u201d (1969: 47\u201363).\nSuch knowledge requires two things (1969: 55): \n\nthe subject has encountered the item X\n(\u201cfirst-handedness\u201d), and\nthe subject has familiarised themselves through their encounters\nwith X (familiarity).\n\n\nPrice then argues that we are not acquainted with sense-data or\nexperiences (1969: 57\u201360), because, being so fleeting, subjects\ncannot familiarise themselves with them (1969: 58f). Whether this\nundermines the support for Price\u2019s being a target of\nSellars\u2019 (1956 [1997]) criticism is debatable. What are basic\nand given (though after 1960 he no longer uses these words) are\nordinary persisting objects and their properties, known through\nacquaintance, that is, in a first-hand, familiarised way. (In 1932:\n63, however, he follows other sense-data theorists in rejecting this:\n\u201cI am not acquainted with an actual instance of\ntableness\u201d, thus not with actual tables; see also 1927: 110).\nThis acquaintance is more fundamental than knowledge from sense-data\nand grounds knowledge-by-description, on pain of the latter \u201cnot\ndeserv[ing] the name of knowledge, not even of reasonable belief\n\u2026 [and] hav[ing] no relation to reality\u201d (1969: 68; Price\n[1936: passim] similarly attacks the coherence theory of\ntruth; for discussion: Kneale 1996: vi; Robinson 1972: passim\ncriticises Price\u2019s notion of corrigibility).\n\nPrice\u2019s (1932) assumptions about the given and the\nanalysis of sense-data he derives from them are now controversial.\nMuch of Price\u2019s discussion of sense-data amounts to speculation\nabout how we develop our understanding of the world and its contents,\nwhere the real check on that speculation, pace his attitude\ntowards appeals to science (1932: 2;\n \u00a72.1\n above), comes from developmental psychology and its empirical study\nof the emergence of our world-directed thoughts.\n\nPrice (1964a) is often ignored and indirectly addresses some of\nAustin\u2019s (1962) criticisms. Price (1952a) extensively discusses\nseeming; for discussion: Quinton (1952). Other discussions of Price on\nperception include Murray 1933 and Bauer 1967.\n4. Building on Hume\n\nAnother major contribution is Price\u2019s close, sympathetic\nengagement with David Hume\u2019s theoretical philosophy, especially\non our belief in the external world (1940a) as presented in (Hume\n1739\u20131740: I, iv, 2 \u201cOf Scepticism with regard to the\nSenses\u201d), which Price calls \u201cthe most brilliant thing\n[Hume] ever wrote\u201d (1940b: 16), necessary connections and\ninduction (1940b: 16ff), Hume\u2019s empiricism and its significance\n(1940b), his analysis of belief (1969: ch. 7), and comparisons between\nHume\u2019s and Buddhist no-substance views of the self (1953b: 30;\n1959c: 485). Price states (1940a: 2\u20133) that he\u2019ll treat\nHume as he would a contemporary, though he discusses him more than he\ndoes anyone else.\n4.1 Two Similarities and a Difference with Hume\n\nPrice shares Hume\u2019s conception of two things. First, both hold\nthat (a) experience presents us, or acquaints us, with perceptions,\nimpressions, or sensibilia (ignoring Hume\u2019s scepticism about the\nself); and (b) our belief in an external world amounts to regarding\nthose presented sensibilia as the real external objects or as\nconstituents of external objects. In effect, both reject an\nunderstanding of our belief in an external world as a belief in\nobjects as causes of our perceptions, as lying behind them and not\npart of the world of experience. That is, they both reject the\ntwo-world model with a world of presented experience and another world\nof spatial external objects. However, recall, Price accepts that there\nare physical occupants distinct from sense-data or families of them\nwhich vertically cause our sense-data. Price gives no hint at how (i)\nhis own earlier positive, sense-data theory of perception relates to\n(ii) his engagement with Hume\u2019s theory (though Church [1943:\n317\u2013318] and Laing [1941: 317] make comparisons).\n\nTheir biggest difference concerns the \u201cvulgar\u201d belief that\npresented sense-data are persisting, external spatial objects.\nHume\u2019s whole theory can be described as an error theory. Price\nrejects Hume\u2019s arguments for this (e.g.,\n \u00a74.3\n below). The two resemblances, this difference, and his real\nadmiration for Hume guide Price\u2019s discussion.\n4.2 Hume on Belief about the External World\n\nOfficially, Hume\u2019s (1739\u20131740: I, iv, 2) question is\n\u201cWhat causes induce us to believe in the existence of\nbodies?\u201d. Price suggests that Hume should have asked another\nquestion: \n\n\nThe question which he actually tries to answer \u2026 would come to\nsomething like this: given what characteristics of\nsense-impressions do we assert material-object propositions? \n\n\nAbout this question Price says:\n\n\nNow this is not a psychological question at all, nor is it a causal\nquestion. It belongs to the inquiry which is now called\n\u201cphilosophical analysis\u201d. It is a question about the\nmeaning of material-object words and material-object\nsentences, and about the rules of their use. (1940a: 15)\n\n\nIn understanding Hume\u2019s question thus, Price situates\nHume\u2019s philosophical discussion in debates about the possibility\nof reducing talk about material objects to talk about\nsense-impressions (or sense-data). As we saw, Price himself notably\ncontributed to this debate. However, reading Hume this way more or\nless guarantees that there can be no error of the sort Hume seems to\nallege, since the experiences in response to which we make our\njudgements are being built into the analysis of their meaning. \n\nPrice credits Hume for asking: Why doesn\u2019t \n\n\nthe interrupted and fragmentary character of human\nsense-experience \u2026 every drowsy nod \u2026 shake the opinion\nof us all that matter has a continued existence? (1940a: 20) \n\n\nPrice agrees with Hume that our perceptions are\n\u201cinterrupted\u201d, but clarifies this as a discontinuity in\ntheir character, and not that they are strictly interrupted, except by\nperiods of sleep or unconsciousness. Price further agrees, with\nreservations (1940a: 22\u201331), that this is not the result of our\nimpressions, given their silence about what is there in unsensed\nperiods, nor of reasons. Hume\u2019s explanation is that the belief\nresults from our imagination in conjunction with the character of our\nsense-impressions. Hume characterises the important aspects of our\nimpressions as constancy and coherence, which Price discusses in\ndetail (1940a: chapter 3; see Penelhum 1975: 67ff). Price argues,\ninitially, that Hume\u2019s conception of the notion of identity,\nwhich is central to his discussion, is fundamentally confused. The\nconstruction that Hume is meant to describe is the postulation of a\nsequence of unsensed sensibile forming a series with the sensed ones.\nIn developing this, Price initially goes along with the contrast\nbetween coherence and constancy. The cases that Hume envisages when\ntalking about constancy are based on what Price calls\n\u201cgap-indifference\u201d (1940a: 60\u201362). A schematic\nrepresentation of this is the sequence in a subject\u2019s experience\nof the following sort: A1, A2,\n\u2026 (gap) \u2026 A5, A6,\nwhere A stands for the same type of experience. For example,\nthe subject looks at a clock for two seconds, looks away, and then\nlooks again at the same clock. Price agrees that this sort of sequence\nprompts the subject to postulate the occurrence of\nA3 and A4 (although unsensed). But\nhe points out that we can also talk of gap-indifference if the gappy\nsequence is not monotonous, but is a gappy reproduction of variegated\nfamiliar series, such as\nA1B1C1D1,\nconsisting, say, of A2, \u2026,\nD2, in which case the subject postulates\nB2 and C2. In this way Price\nbrings both constancy and coherence under the term\n\u201cgap-indifference\u201d.\n\nDo the postulated un-sensed sensibilia in the reconstruction of our\nconception of the world exist (1940a: ch. 4)? Hume\u2019s official\nview is \u201cno\u201d. \u201cExperiments\u201d such as giving\noneself double-vision by pressing an eyeball supposedly show this.\nBut, Price argues, these \u201cexperiments\u201d don\u2019t show\nthat there is causal dependence of the existence of the current\nsensibile, or therefore any others, on the nervous system of the\nsubject. But, further, since according to Hume there are no such\nthings as eyeballs, fingers, or nervous systems, he cannot even accept\nthe data his arguments appeal to.\n\nPrice concedes that Hume\u2019s argument can be interpreted\ndifferently.\n\nOne route Price (1940a: 125\u2013133) discusses is to agree that\nthere are the sequences of un-sensed sensibilia imaginatively\npostulated by the ordinary person, but sometimes there are also sensed\nsensibilia sufficiently close in character to some members of the\nun-sensed series to count as the sensing of some of them.\n4.3 Neo-Humeanism: The As-if Theory\n\nPrice offers two general approaches to neo-Humeans. The first he calls\nthe \u201cAs-If\u201d Theory (1940a: ch. 5; also 1930b:\n192\u2013195). The central idea is that a judgement of the form\n\u201cit is as if p\u201d can be true even if\n\u201cp\u201d is not true. One could say of a man who looked\nvery tired, \u201che is as if he had trained for two hours\u201d,\neven if he had not. For material object discourse, the proposal\nbecomes: if someone says, \u201cThere is a table\u201d, they are to\nbe treated as saying \u201cMy current sensibilia is as if there is a\ntable\u201d.\n\nIn Price\u2019s view, Hume tried but failed to show that \u201cthere\nis a table\u201d is false. Hume, being an empiricist, should have\nheld that there is no way to determine whether (or not) there is a\ntable, which Price says is equivalent to claiming that the words\n\u201cThere is a table\u201d are \u201cmeaningless\u201d (1940a:\n143). So the theory should be that although \u201cthere is a\ntable\u201d is strictly meaningless, the claim \u201cit is as if\nthere is a table\u201d is not meaningless, and is, according to the\nas-if theory, what our statement \u201cthere is a table\u201d in\neffect means. One might wonder how a meaningless sentence can be\nembedded in a meaningful complex sentence, but Price clarifies this:\n\u201cmeaningless\u201d simply means \u201cnot confirmable or\ndisconfirmable\u201d (1940a: 148\u2013150).\n\nAccording to this account, our ordinary thought about the surrounding\nworld amounts to the following: We sense various sensibilia, which\ngiven our imaginative propensities makes us envisage continuous and\nvaried streams of unsensed sensibilia which would amount to the\npresence of objects. And we describe things in terms of it being as if\nthese streams occurred although we are not committing to their\nactually having occurred. This practice allows us to anticipate future\nexperiences.\n\nHe interestingly argues that the as-if approach has advantages over\nphenomenalism (1940a: 177\u2013192). First, phenomenalism treats the\npresence of an object as the truth of a counterfactual conditional,\nwhereas in ordinary thought the presence of an object amounts to a\nthing\u2019s real existence (1940a: 177ff). On the as-if approach,\nwhen someone understands a material object claim they envisage the\nsequences of sensibilia their experiences lead them to think of. Price\nthinks this fits ordinary thought better. It builds into ordinary\nunderstanding an envisaging of more than counterfactual conditionals.\nHowever, the whole point of calling it \u201cas-if\u201d-envisaging\nis to treat ordinary talk non-seriously. Where that leaves the\nsupposed advantage is unclear.\n4.4 Neo-Humeanism: The Expressive Theory\n\nPrice develops another Neo-Humean theory he calls the Expressive\nTheory (1940a: 193ff), according to him similar to F.P. Ramsey\u2019s\n(1929: 241ff) suggestion that causal laws are not statements but rules\nfor framing predictions. It proposes that statements apparently about\nthe external world (e.g., \u201cthere is a table over there\u201d)\nare not actually truth-apt, but \u201cexpression[s] of certain sorts\nof mental processes. So far, they are more like exclamations than they\nare like statements\u201d (1940a: 194). If I say \u201cthis\nsense-datum is red\u201d I am making a statement characterising the\nsense-datum. But if I say \u201cthis ball is red\u201d, employing\nthe external object category ball, I am merely giving\nexpression to my imaginative construction or postulation of an\nindefinite number of sensibilia. These are not sensed, but would\namount to the presence of a ball if they did exist. My experiences\nalso prompt me to put them into a model constructed by me to\n\u201ccoordinate\u201d my experiences.\n\nPrice (1940a: 228) extensively discusses Hume mainly to develop a\ntheory somewhat along these austere, Neo-Humean lines hoping to leave\nthe general problems of philosophy \u201cin a more nearly soluble\nstate than we received them\u201d (ibid.). Hofstadter (1941: 612f)\ncriticises Hume and Price\u2019s Neo-Humeanisms as embracing an error\ntheory about unsensed sensibilia and for being unable to analyse\ndispositions. However, Price (1943: 331\u2013334) later defends a way\nof interpreting Hume (against A. H. Smith 1943: ch. 1) on which\n\u201cit is perfectly conceivable that there may be unsensed\nsensibilia\u201d (1943: 334), though \u201cconclusive empirical\narguments\u201d show, also according to Hume (1739\u20131740: 211),\nthat \u201call our perceptions are dependent on our\norgans\u201d.\n4.5 Hume on Induction\n\nPrice (1940b) takes Hume\u2019s discovery of the problem of induction\nto be \u201cHume\u2019s greatest service to Philosophy\n[\u2026and\u2026] one of the most important advances in the whole\nhistory of thought\u201d (1940b: 30). On Price\u2019s (1940b:\n17\u201331) helpful, detailed analysis, the problem is, for instance,\nnot that induction seems to be \u201can irrational\nprocess\u201d (like committing logical fallacies is) but a\n\u201cnon-rational\u201d one (like sleeping) (1940b: 31).\nPrice interprets Hume\u2019s \u201cmore constructive solution of the\nproblem\u201d (1940b: 31) as the articulation of a sense of\nreasonableness, a criterion of \u201cjust reasoning\u201d, an\ninductive sense \u201cover and above the principles of deductive\ninference enunciated by Formal Logic\u201d (1940b: 35). Asking why it\nis sensible or reasonable to generalise and predict in an inductive\nway is to ask an important though \u201cmeaningless question\u201d\nor \u201cnot a question at all\u201d (1940b: 34). This reading of\nHume is echoed later in Strawson\u2019s (1952: 256ff) famous\n\u201canalytic solution\u201d (Snowdon 2009: \u00a78.4). According\nto Price, this dissolution fits well with ordinary thinking about\nreasonableness (1940b: 36; and\n \u00a72.3\n above). However, Price (1969: ch. 7, 176ff; also 1940b: 29) argues\nthat Hume\u2019s conception of induction is too narrow, since it\nholds only for \u201cthe causal sort of constant conjunction\u201d\n(1969: 176); induction is relevant also in other contexts.\n4.6 Hume\u2019s Theory of Belief\n\nPrice (1969: ch. 7) extensively discusses Hume\u2019s theory of\nbelief, the solution to Hume\u2019s new problem about belief (1969:\n160), which asks: \u201cWhat is belief?\u201d, and \u201cHow do we\ndistinguish belief from disbelief and merely entertaining a\nproposition without belief or disbelief?\u201d Price does not relate\nHume\u2019s problem to its natural background, Locke and\nBerkeley\u2019s ideational models of understanding. For Price,\nHume\u2019s central point is that when entertaining a belief, which\namounts to having a structure of ideas, we entertain the very same\nideas as when we simply consider the claim without believing it; so\nbelief cannot consist in the addition of an extra idea (1969:\n160\u2013161).\n\nHume\u2019s proposal is, famously, that talk of \u201cbelief\u201d\nstands for the presence of the ideas being more lively or vivacious.\nFurther, Hume\u2019s view is that the terms \u201csolidity\u201d\nand \u201csteadiness\u201d enable us to focus on the special\n\u201cfeel\u201d of believed thoughts, produced by an impression\nwith its own high degree of vivacity. On his picture, the\nimpression\u2019s high \u201cvivacity\u201d creates the\nideas\u2019 vivacity by being based on the experience of constant\nconjunction establishing evidence of a causal link between the present\nimpression\u2019s content and the idea in the belief.\n\nPrice criticises Hume for supposing that the link must be causal. If I\nsee a tree I shall believe that it has roots, but not because the tree\ncauses the roots, but because trees have roots as their parts (see\nalso\n \u00a74.5).\n Price sees another severe limitation: Hume\u2019s account does not\nfit belief in generalisations themselves. If seeing some water makes\nme think of the law that water freezes at 0\u00b0C, that is not because\nthe sight of water is linked to seeing it freeze at that temperature.\nAnd, his model of belief-formation does not apply to beliefs formed by\ninference.\n4.7 Freedom and Assent: Hume versus Descartes\n\nFinally, Price (1969: 22, 26, 41, 221\u2013240) defends his own\nwell-known views about our degree of freedom in relation to assent by\nstudying Hume (1739\u20131740: Appendix) and Descartes\u2019\ndisagreement (1641: Meditation 4). Hume\u2019s official view is that\nbelief is independent of the will and something over which we have no\nmastery. In contrast, Descartes maintains that judgements are acts of\nthe will. Price thinks it is obvious that we cannot simply decide to\nbelieve something (1969: 225ff, 238), but we can decide to investigate\na question and decide what type of evidence to scrutinise, meaning\nthat we might deliberately incline ourselves to think a\ncertain way.\n\nHume and Descartes, however, don\u2019t dispute this possibility.\nDescartes affirms the freedom not to believe, given the\nchance of erroneous belief. Since we are free to remain agnostic, we\nare responsible for our errors, and not God, who is not a deceiver. On\nPrice\u2019s view, even if we cannot simply abandon a belief, such as\none\u2019s belief now that one is reading, we can \u201ctrain\nourselves\u201d (1969: 225) over time to refrain from forming such\nbeliefs. There are also abnormal subjects who form beliefs, e.g., that\nthey are made of paper, or are surrounded by impostors. We are, thus,\nnot impelled to form commonsensical beliefs (also 1930a: 26; 1930b:\n193f). Finally, Price (1969: 239f) criticises Hume, the philosopher he\nmost admired, for inconsistency. Hume stresses that beliefs are\ninvoluntary but also thinks that we can appreciate and respond to his\nsceptical arguments, if only for a short time.\n5. Recognition\n\nPrice\u2019s third main contribution is his ambitious analysis of\nthinking, specifically of how what Price calls \u201cfull concept\napplication\u201d emerges from its roots in experience (especially\n1953a). Price\u2019s answer, in brief, is that it emerges because the\nrecipients of experience are intelligent. Price stresses an\nenvironmental condition for concept-formation: the presence\nof \u201crecurrence\u201d in our environment. Thus, there are lots\nof red things, worms, leaves, and so on. Price claims that without\nrecurrence for us to encounter there could be no thought. Incessant\nnovelty would block conceptual acquisition.\n\nPrice\u2019s interesting claim is not obviously true. To be entitled\nto hold that single examples are not enough, Price must provide a\ntheory of concept-formation.\n5.1 Price\u2019s Metaphysical Neutrality regarding Recurrence and Properties\n\nHow should recurrence be analysed (1953a: ch. 1)? One proposal is that\nrecurrence consists in a universal (or characteristic) being\npresent in different things. An alternative analysis invokes the\nnotion of resemblance. Rather than saying red things have a\nuniversal in common it is proposed that red things resemble each\nother. In a rich discussion which is, besides his work on perception,\nprobably his most influential, Price finds difficulties and strengths\nin both ways of speaking. \n\nMost notably, on what Armstrong (1978: 15) calls Price\u2019s\n\u201cfully worked-out\u201d analysis of resemblance nominalism,\nsomething is in the class of things with recurring feature F if\nit resembles a group of standard F-objects, exemplars, as\nclosely as the exemplars resemble each other (1953a: 20\u201322). See\nalso, e.g., Armstrong (1978: 46ff, 54f; 1989: 15, 17, 47f);\nRodriguez-Pereyra (2002: ch. 7) describes Price\u2019s\n\u201cAristocratic Resemblance Nominalism\u201d (2002: 10) as the\nversion which \u201ccurrent writers on the topic usually have in\nmind\u201d; and Paseau (2015: 95) criticises resemblance theories for\n\u201cthe misleading connotation of subjectivity or\nanthropocentricism\u201d. However, Price works out what he calls\n\u201cThe Philosophy of Resemblances\u201d. He distinguishes this\n\u201contological doctrine\u201d as the \u201cstarting\npoint for\u201d \u201cepistemological theories\u201d such as\nnominalism, conceptualism, and imagism (1953a: 22\u201323). The\nontological view he works out is thus not necessarily nominalist.\n\nIn his view, both analyses of recurrence are ultimately satisfactory\nbut have inelegant aspects in certain contexts. We can employ either\ndepending on which helps. Price distinguishes the views as two\nalternative ways of describing matters: sameness versus\nresemblance. This illustrates Price\u2019s special sort of\nmetaphysical neutralism (see also\n \u00a72.4\n above). The universals and resemblance languages are \u201ctwo\ndifferent (systematically different) terminologies, two systematically\ndifferent ways of saying the same thing\u201d (1953a: 30); Armstrong\ncalls Price\u2019s the \u201calternative languages view\u201d\n(1978: 47; 1989: 139). For criticism, see Raphael (1954\u201355:\n\u00a72) and Brandt (1954: 633). Notably, Price\u2019s (1946) earlier\nHertz lecture defends realism about universals against resemblance\ntheories (Brandt 1954: 633; Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002: 125). It is an\ninteresting, though unexplored, question how Price\u2019s version of\nneutralism compares with apparently similar meta-ontological positions\nsuch as Carnap\u2019s (1950). \n\nMost importantly for him, Price frequently argues that his many\ndistinctions and general approach to recognition and mental life\noverall are compatible with whichever view one takes on key\nmetaphysical issues such as the natures of properties and of\nperception (Butchvarov 1998: 94\u201396 discusses this and highlights\nsimilarities with Strawson 1966: 47\u201348; 1985: ch. 4). For\ninstance, when drawing the primary and secondary recognition\ndistinction (see\n \u00a75.3),\n he argues for this in detail (see 1953a: 55\u201374 [on properties],\n50 [perception]; see also\n \u00a72.4).\n5.2 Conceptual Thinking and Recognition: Thinking in Absence and in Presence\n\nPrice (1953a: 33) credits Ryle\u2019s (1949: ch. 2) famous discussion\nof know-how with making clear that intelligence, which grounds our\nconceptual capacities, also receives expression in action, even if not\npreceded by thought. To Price, though, the mode of intelligence that\ngrounds thinking, the \u201cfundamental intellectual process seems to\nbe the experience of recognition\u201d (1953a: 34\u201335).\nConceptual thinking is a capacity which enables us to think of\nthings in their absence, a phrase he was known for (see also\n \u00a75.4;\n Sellars 1956 [1997: 65]). A requirement for reaching that level of\nthinking is the ability to think about them in their\npresence. He calls this recognition. He further claims,\nvery implausibly from contemporary perspectives, that full\nconcept-possession requires the capacity to recognise instances when\nencountered (1953a: 34\u201335). A genuine concept must be, in\nPrice\u2019s words, \u201ccashable\u201d (1953a: 35) in this way.\nFurther, recognition does not require language; it doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily involve linguistic expression either privately or\npublicly. When one recognises one\u2019s son one need not utter\n\u201cHere\u2019s my son\u201d (see also Salmon 1986: 168). Also,\nlearning a language requires learning to recognise that\nlanguage\u2019s words. This cannot rest on possessing language.\nFinally, recognition can be of characteristics or of individuals; the\nformer is basic.\n5.3 Secondary versus Primary Recognition\n\nA key distinction in his theory is between (a) primary recognition,\ni.e. of a characteristic presented in experience, and (b) secondary\nrecognition, i.e. of something beyond what is presented in experience\n(1953a: 44ff). His favourite examples are recognising an instance of\nred (primary), and recognising a lump of lead (secondary). Price\nclaims that in recognising it as lead the subject goes beyond the\ncharacteristics she notices. Rather, she treats the presented features\nas signs (see\n \u00a75.4\n below; 1953a: ch. 4).\n\nObviously, secondary recognition can be mistaken. Price calls such\nmistakes, \u201cerrors of recognition\u201d (1953a: ch. 3). Someone\ncould take a grey lump to be lead even if it was not. But Price argues\nthat it is different with primary recognition. A statement in\nresponse to a primary recognition might be erroneous, e.g., when using\nthe wrong word. But if one notices a feature presented in experience\nand has an apparent memory of encountering it earlier, then one is\nrecognising the feature, whether or not one had encountered it before.\nThis argument\u2019s two crucial assumptions are \n\n(i)\nthat the presented feature fixes what it is recognised as, and\nsince it is there, what it is recognised as cannot differ from it, and\n\n(ii)\nthe occurrence of recognition simply involves the\napparent sense of familiarity, which is there whether or not\nit has been previously encountered. \n\n\n(ii) is hard to accept.\n5.4 Sign-Cognition\n\nWhat Price calls \u201csign-cognition\u201d, \u201ccognition of the\nabsent\u201d (1953a: 95), is \u201cthe type of cognition in which\nsomething not immediately experienced is brought before the mind by\nmeans of a sign\u201d (1953a: 88). Price thinks that it is crucial to\nexplain what \u201cbeing before the mind\u201d amounts to here. For\ninstance, a subject recognises that someone is at the door by hearing\na knock\u2014that someone is absent from the subject\u2019s\nexperience but brought before the mind by means of a sign, the knock.\n\n\nSign-cognition need not involve a linguistic response, nor the\nentertainment of an image of what is signified. But, the recognition\noften involves a generation of preparedness to act. If I recognise an\nunstable cyclist I recognise a possible accident and get ready to\navoid it. So sometimes the recognition leads to actions that block\nwhat is recognised as likely. Price adds that there is something\nabstract about what is recognised. For example, if I recognise that\nrain is imminent the specific character of the actual rain is not\nsignified. On the other hand what is recognised can be fairly\nspecific\u2014the action-readiness that is stimulated might also be\nspecific and delicate. These differences are matters of degree. He\nadds too that there are differences in degree in how strong the sign\nis or is taken to be. If one hears thunder then that is a strong sign\nof earlier lightning, but hearing a police siren is a fairly weak sign\nof a local crime. It may just be a traffic accident call-out. Further,\nthe temporal direction of what is signified can be the past, as with\nthe lightning, the present, or the future. Price often discusses\nsign-recognition in animals (especially cats, leading Iris Murdoch\n[1940] to call him a \u201cfelinist\u201d, see also Mac Cumhaill\n& Wiseman 2022: 78), calling it \u201cthe typical achievement of\nthe animal mind\u201d (1953a: 98) and reveals a genuine awareness of\nthe behaviour of animals (e.g., animal vigilance, 1953a:\n108)\u2014this interest echoes Hume (1739\u20131740: III, xvi; 1748:\nsect. 9).\n\nBut what does it mean to talk of the signified feature as thought of?\nThe adult case of recognition is based on the capacity to tell of\npresented cases whether (or not) they fall under a possessed concept.\nPrice points out that this capacity can be possessed without being\nactualised and can be actualised to different degrees. He proposes\nthat we should say of sign-recognition that the concept of the\nsignified is partially actualised in the subject.\n\nRoughly, this half-actualisation can be specified operationally,\nalthough Price expresses it differently. If I see smoke and take it as\na sign of fire in the environment that means that my dispositions\nto behave are modified in a way that is conducive to encountering\nfire. Crucially this can happen in us (even though we do have the\nconcept of \u201cfire\u201d) but it can happen in creatures without\nthe concept. Price captures this change by talking of an increased\nvigilance for fire (1953a: 120f). This is what \u201chaving in\nmind\u201d in such cases amounts to.\n\nPrice extensively relates sign-cognition also to logical notions, such\nas disjunction, conditionals, and negation (1953a: ch. 5; 1929\ndiscusses negation further); of this discussion, Beck (1953: 560)\nsays, \u201cPsychologically this is the most subtle part of his\n[1953a] book\u201d. Also, understanding thinking in this way, he\nargues, avoids presupposing other minds, blocking a common objection\nto communication\u2019s being our best evidence for other minds\n(1938: 440ff).\n5.5 Sign-cognition, Meaning, and Symbolisation\n\nPrice (especially 1953a: 144ff, 160ff) also made significant\ncontributions to theorising about meaning.\n\nFirst, he (1953a: 144ff) draws a distinction between two senses of\n\u201cmeaning\u201d: (i) the \u201csign\u201d sense and (ii) the\n\u201csymbol\u201d sense. The first is the sense in which we say\nthat those clouds mean rain, and the second the sense in which the\nword \u201crain\u201d means rain (see also 1938: 444). See also\nGrice 1957 and\n \u00a77\n below.\n\nSecond, he criticises (1953a: 160ff) the view that symbols are a\nspecial sort of sign (Ogden & Richards 1923: 23; Stebbing 1930:\n11), the \u201cSign-Theory of Symbolization\u201d. The natural link\nbetween sign and signified is established inductively. However, one\nmight indicate that one wants a drink by mimicking drinking with\none\u2019s hand. According to Price, this works by resemblance, not\nby establishing an inductive correlation to wanting a drink, and thus\nis unlike the natural, inductively established way that black clouds\nsignify rain\u2014not all symbols are signs.\n\nThird, Price\u2019s general objection to the sign-theory of meaning\nis that it has latched onto something that corresponds to what a\nspectator of a linguistic act, or an interpreter, must engage with,\nbut it completely ignores the point of view of the speaker (or\nwriter). It focuses, as he says, on the consumer and not the producer\nof language (1953a: 198ff). As Price formulates the criticism he says\nthat the sign-theory fails to give any account of the role of symbols\n(language) in what he calls \u201cfree thinking\u201d (1953a:\n200ff), that is thinking about things \u201cin their\nabsence\u201d.\n\nFourth, Price points out that regarding someone\u2019s saying that\np as a sign that it is the case that p, something that\nsustains the effectiveness of communication and testimony, is quite\ndifferent from regarding smoke as a sign of fire, in that it requires\nand depends on a rational speaker emitting the assertion. To talk\nsimply of communication as a sign is to under-describe the nature of\ncommunication.\n\nFinally, Price points out that someone can hear and understand an\nutterance without believing it, without treating it as a sign about\nthe world. He suggests, in effect problematically for sign-theories,\nthat understanding is more basic than expectation-generation.\n5.6 The Imagist Theory of Occurrent Thinking\n\nAnother major focus is Price\u2019s analysis and criticism of the\nImagist Theory of (Occurrent) Thinking (e.g., Berkeley 1710; see\n1953a: 234ff). Price deserves credit for opposing the tendency amongst\nphilosophers of his time to underestimate the importance of images\n(Hamlyn [1984: 95] also remarks on Price\u2019s seriousness regarding\nimagism). Price claims that images, especially visual images (1953a:\n235\u2013237), are employed in thinking, for instance by enabling us\nto calculate things, or remember things.\n\nPrice contrasts imagism as a theory of thinking with\n\u201cverbalism\u201d, the theory that we think in words. Price\nallows that we do think in words. Imagists claim, however, that this\nverbal thinking is secondary, and if it is to be contentful, it has to\nbe cashable in images, whereas thinking in images does not require\nanything else to confer content on it. Price notes that strictly when\nsomeone thinks privately in words, they are employing images of words.\nBut on his understanding, an imagist about thinking means by\n\u201cimages\u201d non-verbal images and takes the basic components\nof thought to be \u201crepresentative images\u201d (1953a: 245;\n1951\u20131952: 143).\n\nHe argues that we ordinarily think in absence, with non-instantiative\nparticulars, that is, items which do not instantiate that which they\nenable us to think about (1953a: 253ff). He then affirms that images,\nin his sense, come closer to being instances of the concepts under\nwhich the topical objects fall than do words. They are, he says,\n\u201cquasi-instantiative\u201d (1953a: 255). Although Price is\nhimself prepared to say this, it is hard to understand talk of\ncloseness with regard to instantiation. Price helpfully\nsuggests that such things as models and diagrams also more closely\ninstantiate concepts than words do: they\u2019re also\n\u201cquasi-instantiative\u201d. Price\u2019s final criticism is\nthis: imagists have no good reason to insist that thinking has to\nemploy \u201cquasi-instantiative\u201d things. He says that thinking\nin words has content in virtue of links between the words and\nostensive definitions of those words. These definitions ground\nrecognitional capacities which get activated when experience presents\nthe right sorts of particular. Price puts it this way: \n\n\nmy memory of what a crocodile is like is already operating in another\nway, because my word-producing and word-recognising capacity is firmly\nlinked to it. (1953a: 263) \n\n\nThus, (A) occurrent thinking need not be carried by images, and (B)\nthinking in words is perfectly possible.\n\nPrice\u2019s understanding of how thinking, when it is carried by\nimages, works, is sketched in his answers to the traditional problems\nof resemblance. \n\n(1)\nThere are no hard rules about how closely images (say of a\ncrocodile) must resemble the thing thought about (the crocodile).\n\n(2)\nHow do images fix content by resemblance when crocodile-images\nresemble not only crocodiles but also other reptiles, and green images\nof crocodiles resemble green? \n\n\nPrice replies that images can be used to focus on one thing rather\nthan another by the presence of a word or a stimulating perception and\nbeing situated in a mental set (1953a: 268ff). To flesh this out, he\n(1953a: 273ff, 283\u2013284, 296) mentions Hume\u2019s proposal that\nsome images are \u201cpresent in power\u201d though not\n\u201cpresent in fact\u201d (1739\u20131740: I, i, 7; also\ndiscussed here: 1959c: 483), that is, that the subject has a\n\u201cmultiform image-producing capacity\u201d (1953a: 273), is\ndisposed to produce a sequence of multiple images, say, of a\ncrocodile, and not just one crocodile-image. These images fix what is\nfocused upon with a word or thought, though sometimes a word, say\n\u201ccrocodile\u201d, itself fixes the setting, the interpretation,\nand \u201cwhich of these resemblances will be the psychologically\neffective one\u201d (1953a: 269).\n\nPrice also addresses the traditional problem of generality, how\nimage-based thinking can have general content. Price argues that it is\nan illusion that it is somehow easy in an image-based model of\nthinking to account for thoughts about individuals. One has an image\nof a face but which individual face is it an image of? Couldn\u2019t\nanother person have a face that resembles that image? Price thinks\nHume makes some progress by postulating the availability of many other\nimages. Price also allows that in some cases it may be possible to\nhave generic images akin to composite images formed by superimposing\nlots of photographs. But in some cases of generality (e.g., the class\nof triangles) no such composite can be imagined. Price also allows\nindeterminate images, like Locke\u2019s (1689) suggested abstract\nideas, to sustain generality (1953a: 287\u2013294). Real spatial\nentities cannot be indeterminate, but images may be in a realm where\nindeterminacy is possible. Such speculative proposals about\nimage-realms are also central to his famous account of the afterlife\non which the \u201cNext world, if there is one, might be a world of\nmental images\u201d (1953c: 3; 1968b: 3; 1972: ch. 6; for discussion:\nBadham 1976: 68, 133\u2013146; Hick 1968: 110; Aldwinckle 1972:\n97\u201399; Lewis 1973: 142; Ducasse 1961: 128; Ayers [1971: 397]\ndefends Price against Penelhum\u2019s [1970: 47\u201353] charge of\nsolipsism).\n\nFor Price (1953a: 297), imagism\u2019s \u201cvery serious\ndefect\u201d is its inability to account for logical thinking (e.g.,\nwith negation, disjunction, possibility/actuality, and\nquantification).\n5.7 Price\u2019s Dispositional Conceptualism\n\nAccording to Price, symbolic thinking doesn\u2019t exhaust the\ncontent of thought; he writes, \u201cpart of what we think is always\nsymbolised, but not the whole of it \u2026 and often only a small\npart\u201d (1953a: 308). For instance, when one searches for the\nright word, one is guided by content that is not yet symbolised. Also,\nthinking in time using a succession of symbols \u201coverflows [the]\nsymbols\u201d (1953a: 309) and never involves the whole\nsymbol-conveyed thought present at any time\u2014the succession must\nbe guided by something already there in full (1953a:\n309\u2013311).\n\nThe extra features of thought missing from symbol-presented content,\nPrice argues (1953a: 302), are not captured by the so-called classical\ntheory of many ancients and earlier moderns such as Locke and Kant, on\nwhich thinking is \u201cthe awareness or inspection of intelligible\nobjects\u2014universals, or concepts, or abstract ideas, or \u2026.\nSubsistent propositions\u201d (1953a: 302). In short, there is no\nphenomenological evidence for this when one is thinking.\n\nThe key is the right view of concepts. In brief, Price\u2019s\napproach is \u201ca dispositional version of Conceptualism\u201d\n(1953a: 353), on which we talk of concept-manifestation in situations\nwhere certain dispositions are present or actualised or partly\nactualised. According to Price, then, concepts are neither the images\none encounters in thinking nor the objects of thinking which we\nintrospectively grasp in thinking. Rather, they are the dispositions\n(i) to recognise instances of the universals which on other accounts\nare equated with the concept itself or (ii) to recognise recurring\nresemblances.\n\nA very thorough and fair critical discussion of Price\u2019s theory\nof recognition and related issues is given in Broad 1954. Other\ncritical but largely sympathetic discussions include L.W. Beck 1953;\nFindlay 1954; Malcolm 1954; L. 1954; Brandt 1954; Mundle 1954;\nButchvarov 1979: 42, 79, 147, 258.\n6. Belief\n\nWe now present some of Price\u2019s significant contributions to the\nphilosophical study of belief, including belief ascriptions\n (\u00a76.1),\n the variety of beliefs\n (\u00a76.6\u20136.8),\n their relations to other states such as knowledge\n (\u00a76.1;\n 1969: chs. 1\u20133), the analysis of \u201cone\u2019s evidence\nfor belief\u201d\n (\u00a76.2;\n 1969: ch. 4), especially from his 1960 Gifford Lectures, published as\nhis magnum opus Belief (1969). Their backbone is his defence\nof the dispositional analysis of belief\n (\u00a76.4),\n in his eyes the standard modern analysis, specifically against\noccurrentist analyses (e.g., Hume and Cook Wilson)\n (\u00a76.3).\n6.1 Knowledge & How it Illuminates Belief\n\nWe start with some general commitments about belief\u2019s\nrelationship to knowledge.\n\nFirst, Price (1969: 30ff) takes belief-ascriptions to be performatory:\nwhen one says \u201cI believe that p\u201d, one is certifying\nto some extent the truth of p. The level of guarantee, however,\nis below that of knowledge claims, which he takes Austin to have shown\nto be performatory and convey a guarantee of truth. Price leaves it\nunclear whether publicly self-ascribed beliefs can count both as\nguarantees and as self-descriptions of one\u2019s state of mind\n(e.g., as being that of belief).\n\nSecond, Price (1969: 42f) suggests that knowledge-ascriptions are\nnormally dispositional, ascribing to subjects a condition explicable\nin counterfactual terms. He notes that we have ways of ascribing what\nis actually factual knowledge in indirect forms\u2014for example,\n\u201cS knows where A is\u201d\u2014but if such an\nascription is to be true it requires that S knows that p\nwhere p is of the form \u201cA is at place so and\nso\u201d (1969: 49\u201350). A different kind of\nknowledge-ascription is \u201cknowledge-by-acquaintance\u201d (see\n \u00a73.7),\n which he understands as knowledge of items, say a place or a person,\nwhich he takes to ground knowledge-by-description, meaning what we\nhave been told in general terms. Knowledge-by-description is only\ngenuine if we can relate the descriptions to what we can sense, the\nrealm of acquaintance. Both Russell earlier and Strawson later\ndeveloped in their own ways this link, though Price credits Jane\nAusten (1811: ch. 21) with drawing the distinction 100 years before\nRussell (1969: 63). Third, Price (1969: 50) follows Ryle:\n\u201cknow-how\u201d ascriptions are in some sense practical and not\nreducible to factual claims.\n\nFinally, Price (1969: ch. 3) defends a variant of the standard account\nof propositional knowledge: in many cases the condition for\nknowing that p is that the subject S believes with full\ncertainty that p, and has conclusive reasons for thinking that\np, and p is true. However, this analysis only applies\nwhere the conviction is generated by inference. Where S simply\nobserves that p, e.g., that something is red or that\nshe\u2019s having a pain, no reasons or inference is involved. The\nanalysis of knowledge in such cases, according to Price, cannot centre\non belief. Thus, knowledge isn\u2019t analysed in just one way.\nEarlier, Price (1930b: 200) claims that knowledge is a\n\u201cdirect\u201d cognitive relation to its objects and is a\n\u201cstate where the distinction between sure and unsure does not\narise at all\u201d.\n6.2 The Analysis of Belief: Some Preliminaries\n\nNow, some preliminary stances regarding belief. First, Price endorses\ntalk of degrees of belief (1969: 39\u201341). Second, in assessing\nthe reasonableness of someone\u2019s belief, the focus must be on the\nevidence that one possesses, not on the evidence available. According\nto Price, the notion of evidence suggests facts that are known,\nwhereas people\u2019s belief-formation can be guided by other beliefs\nthey already have, whether accurate or not. Third, because standards\nfor knowledge are high, when knowledge is unavailable,\n\u201cmere\u201d beliefs need to guide thought and action. Fourth,\ncomplex series of beliefs which support each other might be grounded\noutside themselves in at least four ways: (1) perception, (2)\nself-consciousness, (3) memory, and (4) testimony.\n\nPrice\u2019s attitude to perception as a source of belief can be\ndescribed as Moorean: the regress of the justification of belief is\nterminated by perceptual experiences and self-observation. Perception\nis simply a way to settle questions, whatever sceptical arguments\nmight be offered.\n\nPrice argues that self-consciousness gives us evidence about\nourselves: he writes, for example: \n\n\nMy evidence for believing that I am a timid person is [\u2026] the\nfrequent experiences of fear which I have noticed in myself on many\ndifferent sorts of occasions. (1969: 105)\n\n\nHe blocks scepticism about memory in ways familiar from\n \u00a72:\n sceptical problems about memory can only be generated by relying on\nmemory. A ground for scepticism will rely eventually on something\ndelivered by memory. Say you seem to remember doing something.\nYou\u2019re told that you didn\u2019t do it. Acknowledging this\nrelies on your trusting someone else\u2019s memory of what happened\n(1969: 106\u2013111). Also, to draw a conclusion from premises, one\ngenerally relies on one\u2019s memory of the premises. Thus,\narguments against memory rely on memory, so are self-undermining\n(1930b: 195\u2013196). (Bernecker 2008: 98\u201399 discusses and\nuses Price\u2019s argument; for more on memory: Price 1936:\n16\u201333; 1952c).\n\nPrice stresses how much of what each human being believes is grounded\nin testimony. However, Price argues that the following, widely\naccepted generalisation isn\u2019t well-supported: \u201cWhat there\nis said to be (or to have been) there is (or was) more often than\nnot\u201d (1969: 114). For it involves a clash in the ethics of\nbelief (1969: ch. 11; 1954b: passim): (a) that it is wrong to\nbelieve things that are not supported, and (b) that we should trust\nothers. Another approach he calls an \u201ceconomic\u201d\njustification takes the claim about others as corresponding to a\nrule (not a generalisation) to believe others unless one has\na reason not to do so (1969: 124\u2013126). Its justification is that\nunless one endorses the rule one forgoes the chance of learning about\nmost parts\u2014spatial and temporal\u2014of the world.\n\nFamously, Price (1954b: 23) opposes the ethics of belief, arguing that\nany blame directed on people\u2019s thoughts will have dire\nconsequences, such as that \u201ccharity will almost disappear from\nthe world\u201d (for discussion: Wolterstorff 2005: 326).\n \u00a74.7\n above discusses his view that we cannot simply decide to believe\nsomething (1969: 225ff, 238). However, he defends, against Newman\n(1870: ch. 6), John Locke\u2019s (1689: IV, chs. 14\u201316, 19)\nEthics of Belief (1969: 130), which in short is that we should assent\nto a degree which corresponds to the strength of our evidence for the\ntruth of the claim.\n6.3 The Occurrence Analysis of Belief\n\nPrice\u2019s central topic is his critique of the occurrence analysis\nof belief and his defence of the dispositional analysis.\n\nPrice proposes that the traditional occurrence analysis should be\nunderstood as focusing on what he calls \u201cassent\u201d (1969:\n204ff), which can stand for an occurrence. But in order to assent to a\nproposition one must entertain it. So Price attempts to say\nsomething informative about entertaining.\n\nPrice belongs in the truth-conditional tradition which links\nunderstanding a proposition to knowing its truth-conditions, what it\nwould be like for the proposition to be true, though, of course,\nwithout linking that to the Davidsonian idea of defining truth for\npropositions. Price distinguishes between knowing the truth-conditions\nand knowing how to verify or falsify the claim in question: we\nunderstand claims of which we cannot determine the truth (1969: 194).\nPrice\u2019s problem is this: knowing what the truth of a proposition\ninvolves is simply a dispositional condition and cannot consist in\noccurrently analysing those conditions\u2014so what is involved\noccurrently in entertaining it? Price insightfully claims that it does\nnot consist in mentally encountering either a pure contentful entity\nor an abstract possibility. His best answer is that the occurrence\ninvolves an experienced state of readiness to engage in analysing the\ntruth-commitments of the proposition (1969: 200ff).\n\nFurther, entertaining a proposition p is necessary to be able\nto doubt, reject, or assert that p, as well as to have a\nconscious desire or aversion regarding p (1972: 38\u201339).\nBernecker (2010: 236) claims that \u201centertaining\u201d plays the\nsame role for Price that \u201cthought\u201d plays in Descartes\n(1641 [1984: 17]), as an \u201cur-attitude that underlies all\nothers\u201d.\n6.4 Price\u2019s Dispositional Analysis of Belief\n\nMost generally, Price\u2019s (1969: 243\u2013266, Series II, Lecture\n1) dispositional analysis equates having a belief with the presence of\na disposition. He thinks that it is obvious that many\nbelief-ascriptions have a dispositional meaning. When we say of a\nsleeping person that she believes Rome was founded in 753 BC that does\nnot ascribe any sort of occurrence or act. Occurrence theorists do not\ndeny this, but claim that some belief-ascriptions ascribe occurrences,\nand that with dispositional ascriptions the outputs of the disposition\nare such occurrences; so the occurrence sense is more basic than the\ndispositional sense. Price\u2019s sort of dispositional analysis has\nthe following features.\n\nFirst, disposition-ascriptions are equivalent to conditionals, and\nalso can apply to a thing for a time, possibly very short, but\npossibly throughout the object\u2019s existence.\n\nSecond, to pin down belief in terms of its characteristic outputs one\nshould not focus simply on action-outcomes. Characteristically,\nbeliefs can give rise to inaction, as when your belief that the radio\nis properly tuned means you leave doing anything about it. More\ninterestingly, beliefs give rise to emotions or feelings (1969:\n267ff). Your belief that there is a snake present generates fear, and\na belief that suddenly seems to be false generates surprise (1969:\n275ff).\n\nThird, Price (1969: 280\u2013285) defends the idea (against Kneale)\nthat certain states of belief are ones in which something is felt.\n\n\nFourth, beliefs give rise to other beliefs. As he puts it: \u201cWe\nneed beliefs because we need guidance not only in our actions but in\nour thoughts also\u201d (1969: 291). Sometimes this generation of\nbelief amounts to an experienced inference, in which case the subject\nmaking the inference must assent to the premises and also to the\nconclusion, occurrences which Price calls \u201cinward and\nprivate\u201d mental acts (1969: 295), but sometimes the inference is\nautomatic and not \u201clived through\u201d (1969: 293).\n\nPrice, thus, recommends that belief is recognised as a multiform\ndisposition (1969: 294\u2013296), in which inner acts of assent\nfigure amongst the outputs of the disposition. This view inclusively\nincorporates what he sees as the insights of the traditional\noccurrence analysis and the dispositional approach. Price aims, as is\ntypical of him, to bring out the best, as he sees it, in both sides.\nWhat he brings out most is that much needs to be done to fill out the\ndispositional analysis. (Salmon 1986: 168 compares Price\u2019s\ndispositional view of belief with his own.)\n6.5 Applications of the Dispositional Model\n\nPrice applies his dispositional model to various issues related to\nbelief, such as the phenomenon of half-belief (1964b: 152ff; 1969:\n305ff), Newman\u2019s (1870) distinction between notional and real\nassent (1969: 315\u2013348), and the puzzle of self-verifying beliefs\n(1969: 349\u2013375), presented as a puzzle for the objectivity of\ntruth.\n\nPrice accounts for half-beliefs with his dispositional model as cases\nwhere there are some elements in the normal, complex\ndisposition which constitutes belief but others are absent.\nFor example, maybe the tendency of the disposition to remain is weaker\nthan it characteristically is, or the disposition to emotion might be\nprompted by certain sensory inputs, as in aesthetic contexts when\nwatching a film or reading a book (1969: 307\u2013308), without\ndispositions to act in certain ways.\n\nThe problem of self-verifying beliefs is that they seem to undermine\nthe conviction that our beliefs are made true by states-of-affairs\nindependent of our beliefs. Consider a competition in which one\nteam\u2019s members are convinced that they can win and this belief\nmotivates them to persevere through difficulties and win. Their belief\nthat they can win is made true by this very belief. Price\u2019s\nsolution is to claim that the belief\u2019s role is to be part of a\ncausal condition which produces the outcome; the truth of the belief\nis in this way an objective matter.\n6.6 Moral Beliefs\n\nPrice argues that there are no moral beliefs properly speaking: \n\n(i)\nbeliefs are things which are truth-apt, that is can be true or\nfalse, and \n(ii)\n\u201cmoral judgements\u201d are essentially expressions of the\nsentiment of approval or disapproval, something which cannot be true\nor false (1969: 398). \n\n\nUltimately, he prefers the \u201cAttitudinarian Analysis\u201d\n(1969: 379): \u201cit seems to accord with [my] own moral\nexperience\u201d (1969: 380). When we express doubt about our moral\njudgements, for instance, that simply amounts to expressing\nuncertainty about the attitude, and not an uncertainty about a fact\n(1969: 383ff). However, on various points, he argues that \n\n\nthe difference between an \u201cattitudinarian\u201d analysis of\nmoral judgements and an \u201cobjectivist\u201d analysis, in which\nthey are held to be true or false, is not quite so clear-cut as it\nlooks. (1969: 399)\n\n\nFurther, he favours Hume and Hutcheson\u2019s way of developing this\nanalysis over R.M. Hare\u2019s, which treats moral judgements as\ninjunctions or imperatives (1969: 396, 418\u2013420). He suggests\nthat to make a moral remark to another is not like telling them what\nto do but is rather a matter of laying your attitude before them, as\nan invitation to feel the same. He also claims that simply adopting a\nuniversal rule unaccompanied by feelings of approval is not sufficient\nfor having a moral attitude\u2014it is more akin to merely\ninternalising a rule. In fact, creatures without feeling cannot be\ncreatures with moral attitudes (1969: 420\u2013425). \n\nPrice aims to shrink the difference between ethical realism and\nethical non-realism. Later, more sophisticated twentieth century\nefforts largely ignored Price\u2019s interesting explorations.\n6.7 Belief-In\n\nPrice was well-known especially amongst philosophers of religion for\nhis discussion about whether \u201cbelieve-in\u201d reports are\nreducible to \u201cbelieve-that\u201d ascriptions (1964c; 1965;\n1969: 426\u2013454). Price argues that many are clearly equivalent\n(1969: 431\u2013435). For example believing in the Loch Ness monster\nis believing that there is such a monster. But in other\ncases\u2014such as believing in a friend, or in God\u2014an\nimportant element is trust (and love) which involves a feeling; so the\nreduction cannot always work (1964c: 10\u201311; 1969: 449ff).\nLitzenburg (1967) directly responds to Price\u2019s view, and\nSleeper\u2019s (1966) metaphysics of belief builds on Price\u2019s\naccount; for discussion: Mitchell 1971: 7ff, Malcolm 1964: 107ff.\n6.8 Religious Belief\n\nFinally, Price wrote influentially on (i) the nature of religious\nbelief, and (ii) its conflict with science and empiricism (see\n \u00a72.2\n above; also 1953b; 1964c; 1969: Series 2, Lecture 10; 1972; among\nothers). In 1953b and in \u201cReligious Belief and Empiricist\nPhilosophy\u201d (1969), he engages especially with two recent\ndevelopments: that religious claims such as \u201cGod exists\u201d\n(i) are neither true nor false, being devoid of descriptive meaning;\nand (ii) should be interpreted as recommendations of\nlifestyles\u2014say, to love thy neighbour\u2014rather than as\nclaims about transcendent entities (1953b: 3).\n\nPrice suggests the following. Religious \u201crecommendations\u201d\nadvise us to adopt a certain worldview, putting it briefly, to live a\nloving life. Some sort of empirical test is available for the\nrecommendation to live a loving life. We can try it or observe such\nattempts and see if it produces approval and what the recommenders\nthink it will. Importantly, though, the recommended worldview and ways\nof life are committed to the assertion of certain propositions,\nwithout which they cannot even be understood (1953b: 7). For instance,\nthe lifestyle recommendations of theistic religions (e.g.,\nChristianity) require propositions about the real existence of a\ntranscendent deity, human immortality, and generally a theistic theory\nof the universe (1953b: 4\u20136), and for non-theistic religions\nsuch as Buddhism, propositions about reincarnation and the\nnon-existence of a substantial Ego (1953b: 6\u20137). Further, Price\nargues strongly that engaging in many of the religious practices\n(e.g., petitionary prayer) without these beliefs is intellectually\ndishonest. The wishful beliefs, say in God, are an essential part of\nthe psychological techniques and practices of the religion (1972:\n38\u201340). However, earlier (1964c: 18\u201319) he makes room for\ndevotional practices which require merely an \u201cas-if\u201d\nattitude towards God (see\n \u00a74.3).\n\nPrice is, thus, a realist about the interpretation of religious\nclaims, in contrast to his contemporary, Braithwaite (1955). Price\n(1969: 476\u2013488) aims to locate experiential evidence that bears\non such claims and empirical tests of the realist religious hypotheses\nfor earthbound creatures like us. If successful, empiricists should at\nleast have no qualms about the meaningfulness of claims, say, about a\ntranscendental god. The religious view is that we are capable of\nencountering God in devotional experience, such as prayer which\ninvolves a \u201creal\u201d rather than \u201cnotional\u201d\napprehension of God (see 1969: 318\u2013319; Newman 1870)\u2014in\nshort, prayer allows us to be acquainted with God rather than to know\nabout God by description\u2014and via \u201csuper-sensory cognitive\npowers, an awareness of the Divine\u201d (1953b: 31, also 11ff),\nthough he claims in (1964c: 22\u201323) that it would be\n\u201cpresumptuous\u201d of the ordinary religious person to think\nthat they\u2019ve achieved this. So to test it empirically we must,\nwithout prior belief in religion, try out devotional practice\nand see what experiences occur. He does not say what the experiential\noutcome will in general be, and he does not explore problems that\nmight be raised about the interpretation of the resulting experiences.\n(Price\u2019s acquaintance with an apparent religious experience is\nrecounted by Hick 2002: 74\u201375.) He (1964c: 20\u201324) does\ndescribe, however, that it involves a personal relationship of faith,\nbelief, and loving confidence in God, which isn\u2019t propositional\nand involves a removal of the illusion that God is absent (1964d: 35).\nFor discussion: Hartshorne 1964: 31. Price seems content to have\nlinked religious claims to such empirical testing: he writes,\n\u201c\u2018Try it and see for yourself\u2019 is one way of\nformulating the empiricist principle\u201d (1935: 331; 1964c: 24;\n1969: 488;\n \u00a72.2\n above). Also, he argues (1953b: 37\u201354) that psychical research\nhas \u201cdiscovered\u201d (1953b: 54) other forms of\n\u201csupernormal cognition\u201d. Although these discoveries do\n\u201cnothing at all to establish [the sense of the Divine]\u201d\n(1953b: 49), they \u201cdiminish or perhaps even \u2026 remove the\nchief obstacle[:] \u2026 the Materialistic conception of human\nnature\u201d (1953b: 53; for favourable discussion see Russell 1954\n[1999: 147\u2013150]; see also\n \u00a77\n below).\n7. Remarkable Anticipations\n\nWe end by illustrating a very impressive feature of Price\u2019s\ndiscussions: the degree to which he anticipates ideas that became a\nfocus of considerable attention later.\n\nIn Quine and Davidson\u2019s terminology, Price (1953a: ch. 7) is\nconcerned with the possibility of translation and interpretation,\nalthough he does not speak that way. Here, Price has latched onto the\nidea that accurate language-acquisition depends on and requires that\ncertain utterances dealing with observable matters must be true. He\ndoes not propose highly general principles, such as truth-maximisation\nfor belief as a constraint on interpretation\u2014indeed he is\nprobably against such a general claim\u2014but he appreciates the\ncrucial role of truth in relation to observation sentences. He also\nstresses the idea that language-acquisition centrally depends on\ninduction, an insight which any response to Wittgenstein\u2019s\nrule-following discussion should acknowledge. What is surprising,\nlooking back, is that these ideas in Price were not taken up, and his\nideas played no role in later discussion. The explanation for this, we\nbelieve, is that his book was unfortunately often ignored. \n\nElsewhere, Price (1929: 98) says that it is unfortunate to call\nstatements about oneself or one\u2019s mental states\n\u201csubjective\u201d as they are, in his words, \u201cas\n\u2018objective\u2019 as anything else, for they are realities\nexisting in the world whether anyone thinks about them or not\u201d\n(1929: 98). This anticipates reactions against Nagel (1974) and\nJackson\u2019s (1982: 130) attempts to capture our mental lives with\nwhat-it\u2019s-like-ness talk and the subjective/objective\ndistinction. He remarkably analyses \u201cknowing what it is like for\nsomething to be red\u201d (1969: 55) as a case of\nknowledge-by-acquaintance (see\n \u00a73.7\n above), with (1) first-handedness, and (2) familiarity, together\nyielding the capacity to recognise the colour when one encounters it\nelsewhere. He doesn\u2019t seem to think that such knowledge brings\nin anything non-objective.\n\nInterestingly, when applying his theory of recognition to recognising\nindividuals, Price reveals that he thinks of persisting individuals as\na succession of short-lived particulars, in effect what came to be\ncalled time-slices (1953a: 39).\n\nPrice\u2019s (1953a: 144ff) distinction between the sign and symbol\nsenses of meaning anticipates the same distinction in Grice (1957),\nfamously labelled natural versus non-natural meaning, by four years\nlooking at publication dates. However, Grice\u2019s paper was written\nearlier than when it appeared. Neither Price nor Grice mentions the\nother in their accounts and there is no way to decide who influenced\nwhom or whether they were independent.\n\nAccording to Langsam (1997: 57), Price (1932: 31) anticipates but\nquickly rejects the disjunctivist conception of experience later\ndefended by Hinton (1973), Snowdon (1981; 1990), and McDowell (1982).\nHe rejects it because \u201cthere is no qualitative difference\nbetween normal [veridical] sense-data as such and abnormal [e.g.,\nillusory] sense-data as such\u201d (1932: 31; for discussion: Crane\n2005: \u00a71.2).\n8. Legacy\n\nPrice was clearly a major figure during his life-time. Although his\ninfluence seems to have waned quickly after his death, it lived on via\nhis major influence on and continued engagement from his students,\nsome of whom themselves became major figures in philosophy, despite\nhis being, in Warnock\u2019s (1995: 717) words, \u201ca shy,\nreclusive figure, belonging to no school or group and seeking no\ndisciples\u201d.\n",
