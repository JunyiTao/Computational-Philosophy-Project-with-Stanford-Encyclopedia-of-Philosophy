Must we re-compute the nonmonotonic\nconsequences from scratch each time updating is required?\n\nBeishui Liao and his collaborators (Liao et al. 2011) addressed the\nissue of the computational dynamics of argument systems by\ninvestigating under which conditions an argument system can be divided\ninto modules, so that the implications of new information can be\nefficiently computed by updating only the affected module. They\ndiscovered that such modularity is possible for any semantics that has\nthe property of directionality. A semantics is directional if\nand only if, for every argument structure AS, the\nintersection of any extension prescribed for AS with an\nunattacked set /(U/) is identical to one of the extensions prescribed\nfor the restriction of AS to \\(U\\), and vice versa.
