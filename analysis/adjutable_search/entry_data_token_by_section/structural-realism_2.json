    "main_text": "Epistemic Structural Realism (ESR)\n3. Epistemic Structural Realism (ESR)\n\nStructural realism is often characterised as the view that scientific\ntheories tell us only about the form or structure of the unobservable\nworld and not about its nature. This leaves open the question of\nwhether the natures of things are posited to be unknowable for some\nreason or eliminated altogether. Hence, Ladyman (1998) considers\nwhether Worrall\u2019s structural realism should be understood as a\nmetaphysical or epistemological modification of standard scientific\nrealism. Worrall\u2019s paper is ambiguous in this respect. That he\nhas in mind only an epistemic constraint on realism\u2014commitment\nto the structure of our best scientific theories but agnosticism about\nthe rest of the content\u2014is suggested by his citation of\nPoincar\u00e9 who talks of the redundant theories of the past\ncapturing the \u201ctrue relations\u201d between the \u201creal\nobjects which Nature will hide forever from our eyes\u201d (1905\n[1907: 162]). So one way of thinking about structural realism is as an\nepistemological modification of scientific realism to the effect that\nwe only believe what scientific theories tell us about the relations\nentered into by unobservable objects, and suspend judgement as to the\nnature of the latter. (ESR is called \u201crestrictive structural\nrealism\u201d by Psillos 2001.) There are various forms this might\ntake. (See French & Ladyman 2011.)\n\nWe cannot know the individuals that instantiate the\nstructure of the world but we can know their properties and\nrelations.\nWe cannot know the individuals or their\nintrinsic/non-relational properties but we can know their first-order\nrelational properties.\nWe cannot know the individuals, their first-order\nproperties or relations, but we can know the second-order structure of\ntheir relational properties. Russell (1927) and Carnap (1928) took\nthis extreme view and argued that science only tells us about purely\nlogical features of the world.\n\n\nPsillos (2001) refers to the \u201cupward path\u201d to structural\nrealism as beginning with empiricist epistemological principles and\narriving at structural knowledge of the external world. The\n\u201cdownward\u201d path is to arrive at structural realism by\nweakening standard scientific realism as suggested by Worrall. Both\npaths are criticized by Psillos. Russell (1927) was led along the\nupward path by three epistemological principles: firstly, the claim\nthat we only have direct access to our percepts (Ayer\u2019s\n\u201cegocentric predicament\u201d); secondly, the principle that\ndifferent effects have different causes (which is called the\nHelmholtz-Weyl Principle by Psillos); and thirdly, that the relations\nbetween percepts have the same logico-mathematical structure as the\nrelations between their causes. This led him to the claim that science\ncan only describe the world up to isomorphism, and hence to\n (3)\n above since according to him we know only the (second-order)\nisomorphism class of the structure of the world and not the\n(first-order) structure itself. Russell\u2019s upward path is\ndefended by Votsis (2005). Beni (2017a) considers the upward path in\nthe light of the science of perception. Katherine Brading and Elise\nCrull (2017) explore the link between Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nphilosophy of science and ESR, as does Ivanova (2015b) focusing on the\nconnection with conventionalism and neo-Kantianism. Beni (2018) takes\nthe downward path to ESR using information-theory.\n\nMost defenders of ESR assume that there must be individual objects and\nproperties that are ontologically prior to relational structure.\nMatteo Morganti (2004) differs from other epistemic structural\nrealists by arguing for agnosticism about whether there is a domain of\nindividuals over and above relational structure. Mauro Dorato argues\nfor ESR on the grounds that structural realism needs entity realism to\nbe plausible (2000) (but perhaps ontic structural realism can also be\nreconciled with entity realism to some extent (see below)).\n",
