    "main_text": "The Science of Man\n3. The Science of Man\n\nThe scientific dimension of the Observations is in part\nmethodical and in part substantive. As a matter of method, Hartley\nproposes the scientific investigation of \u201cman.\u201d As noted\nabove, this is not unique; physicians had been doing just this for\ndecades, and there were also the examples of Descartes\u2019s\nPassions of the Soul (1649) and Treatise on Man\n(1664), and of Hume\u2019s anonymously published Treatise of\nHuman Nature (1739\u201340). (There is no evidence that Hartley\nknew anything about Hume, or Hume about Hartley.) What is distinctive\nabout the Observations is that it extends Newtonian science\nto the study of human nature.\n\nWe should assume, Hartley writes, that the body\u2019s\n\u201ccomponent particles\u201d are \u201csubjected to the same\nsubtle laws\u201d (OM 1, prop. 9) as are all other material\nentities. The subtle laws are those Newton suggested in the\n\u201cQueries\u201d to his Opticks, and which Stephen Hales\n(1677\u20131761, remembered today as the father of plant physiology\nand for the measurement of blood pressure) further developed in the\nchemical theory in his Statical Essays\u2014i.e.,\nVegetable Staticks (1727) and Haemastaticks (1733).\nDescartes had earlier proposed a model of neural physiology, but in\n1740s Britain the physics the model depended upon would have looked\nout of date. Hartley, in contrast, presented a \u201ctheory of\nvibrations\u201d that explained how the \u201ccomponent\nparticles\u201d that constitute the nerves and brain interact with\nthe physical universe suggested by Newton\u2014a world composed of\n\u201cforces of attraction and repulsion\u201d and having a minimum\nof solid matter.\n\nAs a matter of substance, Hartley proposes:\n\nSince therefore sensations are conveyed to the mind, by the efficiency\nof corporeal causes \u2026 it seems to me, that the powers of\ngenerating ideas, and raising them by association, must also arise\nfrom corporeal causes, and consequently admit of an explication from\nthe subtle influences of the small parts of matter on each other, as\nsoon as these are sufficiently understood. (OM 1, prop. 11)\n\n\nNote the language: \u201ccorporeal causes\u201d\n\u201cgenerate\u201d and \u201craise\u201d ideas \u201cby\nassociation.\u201d Unlike later \u201cassociation\npsychologists\u201d such as James Mill, Hartley does not start with\n\u201cideas\u201d as subjective entities already experientially\npresent to the \u201cmind\u201d and then ask how these are linked.\nRather, he starts with bodily, specifically neurological processes,\nand asks: how do such processes generate and raise our perceptions,\nemotions, thoughts, and actions? This is a proposal for neuroscience,\nnot a version of philosophical or psychological\n\u201cempiricism.\u201d\n\nIf the responses of a nervous system to its physical environment can\ngenerate and raise one \u201cidea,\u201d one flash of consciousness,\nthey can generate any, and all. Thus \u201cthe whole superstructure\nof ideas and associations observable in human life may \u2026 be\nbuilt upon as small a foundation as we please\u201d (OM 1,\nprop. 11). For Hartley, the foundation is simple: nerves\n\u201cvibrate\u201d (on a molecular level, not as violin strings),\nchange their frequencies or amplitudes of vibration, and transmit\nthose changes to other nerves. But thanks to the vast number of\nassociative connections between nerves and within the brain, this\nfundamental mechanism generates all the complexities of action we\nobserve in living beings\u2014both animal and human.\n\nThe first volume of the Observations ends with a bold\nstatement: if an organism \u201ccould be endued with the most simple\nkinds of sensation, [it] might also arrive at all that intelligence of\nwhich the human mind is possessed\u201d (OM 1,\nConclusion).\n\nSuch is an expression of the \u201cerror \u2026 deeper and more\nfundamental than any other\u201d with which Mackintosh charged\nHartley: that of overlooking ontological dualism, \u201cthe\nprimordial and perpetual distinction between the being that thinks and\nthe thing which is thought of\u201d (1836, 245). Descartes maintained\nthis distinction by positing a substance dualism of mind and body (and\nby treating animals as \u201cmere\u201d mechanisms, without\nconsciousness, and humans as rational, sentient beings), and such as\nHume and later James Mill respected it (or at least avoided dealing\nwith it) by writing about the contents of conscious minds while\nkeeping well clear of neurophysiology. But Hartley ignores the\ndistinction between \u201cthinking\u201d and \u201cthought\nof\u201d; he affirms that neurological processes generate\nconsciousness.\n\nIn Hartley\u2019s view, animals are conscious beings, endued with\nsensation and, in neurologically complex species, their own kinds of\nintelligence: hence he affirms their \u201cnear relation\u201d to\nus\u2014which obligates us \u201cto be their guardians and\nbenefactors,\u201d and is reason to refrain from making them suffer\nfor our sport or convenience, and from killing them for food\n(OM 1, prop. 93; cf. OM 2, prop. 52).What separates\nus from animals are simply differences in neuro-anatomy.\n\nAccept that \u201call that intelligence of which the human mind is\npossessed\u201dcould be arrived at by an organism possessing\n\u201cthe most simple kinds of sensation,\u201d and what follows? To\nmany, a line of thought \u201cinvolving all nature into darkness and\nconfusion.\u201d To others, with Priestley, the way of\n\u201centering upon a new world\u201d of scientific discovery, free\nof the dualism of spirit and matter.\n",
