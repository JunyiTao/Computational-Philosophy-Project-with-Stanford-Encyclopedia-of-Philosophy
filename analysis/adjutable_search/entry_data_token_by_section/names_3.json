    "main_text": "Semantics || Meaning and the a priori\n2.3 Meaning and the a priori\n\nThere are propositions we can only confirm or justify by observation\nand experiment. There are, for example, various ways to establish that\nthe Earth is round, an especially conclusive one being\ncircumnavigation. There are other propositions that no observation can\nconfirm, nor, indeed, disconfirm; for instance, the proposition that\nbachelors are unmarried. Since \u201cbachelor\u201d is defined as\nman who has never been married, we derive this proposition\nprior to any consultation of the external world. It is a\npriori.\n\nBy similar reasoning, if \u201cSocrates\u201d meant the teacher\nof Plato and Xenophon, it would be a priori that\nSocrates taught Plato (Kripke 1980: 65). However, unlike the\nproposition that bachelors are unmarried, this claim does not seem to\nbe a priori. Intuitively speaking, the widely held belief\nthat Socrates taught Plato could turn out to be false. Perhaps one day\ndocuments will come to light establishing that the person who served\nas a model for the character of Socrates in Plato\u2019s dialogues\n(and other similar traditions) lived out his life prior to\nPlato\u2019s birth. Such evidence would appear to refute the\ntradition according to which Plato was Socrates\u2019 pupil.\n\nBy contrast, no observation could unseat the belief that bachelors are\nunmarried. Even irrefutable evidence that each individual we thought a\nbachelor had in fact been married would not convince us that bachelors\nwere, after all, married men. We would conclude instead that those men\nweren\u2019t bachelors (compare Putnam 1962 and Unger 1983 on\n\u201ccat\u201d).\n\nNow an a priori proposition is not automatically known. If\none is ignorant of the meaning of the relevant terms, then one\npresumably won\u2019t know the a priori proposition that\nfollows from the meaning. Someone might be unaware, for example, that\nall linguistic discourse is either verse or prose, or that all planets\nhave sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium; yet both\npropositions follow from the definitions of the relevant words\n(\u201cprose\u201d is defined as language without the metrical\nstructure of verse; and the official definition of\n\u201cplanet\u201d includes a clause requiring hydrostatic\nequilibrium).\n\nThe fact that some users of \u201cSocrates\u201d don\u2019t realize\nthat Socrates taught Plato does not immediately show that the\nproposition is a posteriori. It could be that they are\nignorant of the meaning of \u201cSocrates\u201d, and if they had\nknown it, they would also have known (a priori) that Socrates\ntaught Plato. The same goes for the intuition that it could turn\nout that Socrates did not teach Plato. This intuition could\nsimilarly originate in obscuring ignorance of meaning. It should be\nkept in mind that the argument we are considering in this section\n(often termed the epistemic argument) takes\nfor granted that if \u201cSocrates\u201d had a meaning, we would\nknow what it was, and be in a position to draw a priori\nconclusions from it.\n\nWith this one caveat, the epistemic argument is an effective challenge\nto many accounts that provide names with a substantial meaning. Often\nwhat would follow from the proposed meaning is something that,\naccording to our intuition, could turn out to be false. An ingenious\nresponse to the argument is to identify the meaning of a name with\n(roughly speaking) whatever claims about its extension could not turn\nout to be false, according to ordinary speakers\u2019 intuitions\n(Chalmers & Jackson 2001). Such an account of meaning (call it\napriorist) is of course immune to the\nepistemic argument.\n\nWhat sorts of claims are we talking about here? Not the claim that\nSocrates taught Plato: this, intuitively, could turn out to be false.\nBut what about the claim that it could turn out false that\nSocrates taught Plato. The justification for this claim was not\nobservational evidence, but an intuition about a hypothetical\nscenario, and what we would say about Socrates in that scenario. We\nfelt that if the true source of Plato\u2019s character had died\nbefore Plato was born, then it would follow that Socrates did not\nteach Plato. But whence this judgment? Perhaps it stems from the\nconviction that, roughly, \u201cSocrates\u201d will refer to whoever\nturns out to be the actual source of the eponymous character in\nPlato\u2019s dialogues (and other similar traditions). This is not\nquite a priori either. As a claim, it stands or falls on our\nempirical knowledge of the relevant traditions. Still, one imagines\nthe claim could be winnowed down further, until, as it were, the a\nposteriori hull is gone. The remaining polished kernel would then\nserve as the apriorist meaning of \u201cSocrates.\u201d\n\nIt would be interesting to see this exercise carried out in full, but\nwhat would it show? Not that a certain core of knowledge must\nconstitute the meaning of \u201cSocrates\u201d. There is always the\npossibility that \u201cSocrates\u201d has no meaning. Even if the\naccount of what determines the reference of a name has an a\npriori core, we may yet conclude that such reference is\ndetermined extra-semantically. Perhaps the a priori core is\nsimply an (a priori) theory of reference in general, applied\nto the special case of \u201cSocrates\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, the apriorist account, like the epistemic argument that\nled us to it, relies on the assumption that meanings, and their a\npriori consequences, are known to speakers, who then lean on this\nknowledge in forming intuitive judgments about what could turn out to\nbe true of Socrates\u2014or bachelors. But consider the person who\nfinds it intuitive that a planet might not have achieved hydrostatic\nequilibrium? We would like to say that they don\u2019t fully\nunderstand what \u201cplanet\u201d means, given that this is one of\nthe conditions in the 2006 definition arrived at by the International\nAstronomical Union (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n However, on the apriorist account, we are forced to say instead that\nthe proposition that all planets have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium\ndoes not follow from the meaning of \u201cplanet\u201d, as it does\nnot belong to the a priori core (as proven by the one speaker\nwho doesn\u2019t find it intuitive). Indeed, the a priori\ncore, whatever it is, only supports the judgment that all planets have\nachieved hydrostatic equilibrium in conjunction with the a\nposteriori knowledge that achieving hydrostatic equilibrium was a\nclause in the definition of \u201cplanet\u201d stipulated by an\nauthority.\n\nThe concern is that many uncontroversial examples of word meaning are\nnot known to some speakers (and for any example, including\n\u201cbachelor,\u201d we could easily contrive a case in which it\nwas not known to someone), and hence must be excluded by the\napriorist. Even if one is convinced that whatever (directly)\ndetermines the extension of a word constitutes its meaning, there is\nstill no guarantee that a particular (or general) theory of extension\ndetermination can be found, however implicit, in native speaker\nintuitions. Or, supposing it can be, that the process of deriving it\nfrom those intuitions is one of a priori demonstrative\ninference. Like other aspects of linguistic theory, the road from\nnative speaker judgments to theory is presumably the ampliative method\nof science.\n",
