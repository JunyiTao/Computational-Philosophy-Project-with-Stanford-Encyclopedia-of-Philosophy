    "main_text": "Reading the contemporary\u2014structure || Shifting geographies\n6.3 Shifting geographies\n\nA third broad focus in contemporary Africana philosophy reimagines the\nregional mapping discussed above. The common tripartite division\nbetween the continent, the Caribbean, and the Americas is reasonable,\nas far as it goes. But some newer work emphasizes the areas that this\nscheme leaves out.\n\nOne area of focus refuses to reduce the diaspora to the Caribbean and\nthe United States, and explores relatively underappreciated Africana\ncommunities. One approach here, championed by Chike Jeffers (2012),\nPeter James Hudson and Aaron Kamugisha (2014), and others, considers\nthe prospects for specifically Canadian forms of Africana thought.\nAnother approach focuses on the diaspora in Europe. Alanna\nLockward\u2019s (2013) BEBoP (Black Europe Body Politics) curatorial\nproject is one striking example of this work, as are the contributions\nby Barnor Hesse (2009) and others to the volume Black Europe and\nthe African Diaspora.\n\nA second area focuses on certain internal complexities of the standard\nracialized geography. This is the spirit in which a growing cohort of\nthinkers is taking up the question of Africa\u2019s white\ninhabitants. These descendants of the settler colonial populations\nhave come of age at some remove from the colonial incursion, were born\non the continent, and, especially in South Africa, have their fortunes\nand senses of themselves bound up in complicated ways with\nAfrica\u2019s prospects. It is unsurprising, then, that their place\non the continent and, as we\u2019ll see below, in the discipline, has\nbecome a subject of philosophical reflection. Samantha Vice\u2019s\n(2010) germinal essay, \u201cHow Do I Live in This Strange\nPlace?\u201d, anchored a version of this discussion in South\n Africa.[5]\n",
