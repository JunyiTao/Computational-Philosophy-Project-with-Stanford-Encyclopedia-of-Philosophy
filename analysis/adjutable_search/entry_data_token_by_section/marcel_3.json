    "main_text": "Transcendence\n4. Transcendence\n\nMarcel is very clear that the term \u201ctranscendence\u201d has, in\nhis view, become degraded in modern philosophy. Transcendence cannot\nmean merely \u201cgoing beyond\u201d without any further\nspecification. It must retain the tension of the traditional\ndistinction between the immanent and the transcendent, one that\nemphasizes a vertical rather than a horizontal going beyond, a\ntranscendence toward a height, a\n trans-ascendence.[5]\n Although the transcendent is juxtaposed with the immanent, Marcel\ninsists that \u201ctranscendent\u201d cannot mean\n\u201ctranscending experience.\u201d \u201cThere must exist a\npossibility of having an experience of the transcendent as such, and\nunless that possibility exists the word can have no meaning\u201d\n(Marcel 1951a, p. 46). The tendency to discount the idea of\nexperiencing transcendence is the result of an objective view of\nexperience. However, experience is not an object and therefore it\ncannot be viewed objectively. Speaking metaphorically, the essence of\nexperience is not an \u201cabsorbing into oneself,\u201d as in the\ncase of taste, but \u201ca straining oneself towards something, as\nwhen, for instance, during the night we attempt to get a distinct\nperception of some far-off noise\u201d (Marcel 1951a, p. 47). Thus,\nwhile Marcel insists on the possibility of experiencing the\ntranscendent, he does not thereby mean that the transcendent is\ncomprehensible.\n\nThere is an order where the subject finds himself in the presence of\nsomething entirely beyond his grasp. I would add that if the word\n\u201ctranscendent\u201d has any meaning it is here\u2014it\ndesignates the absolute, unbridgeable chasm yawning between the\nsubject and being, insofar as being evades every attempt to pin it\ndown. (Marcel 1973, p. 193)\n\n",
