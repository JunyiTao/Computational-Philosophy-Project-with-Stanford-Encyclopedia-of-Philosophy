    "main_text": "\n\nModern or contemporary Confucianism refers to developments in\nConfucian thought from the early twentieth century to the present. It\nis frequently referred to as New Confucianism, though this term is\nsometimes used more narrowly (for more, see below). It can also create\nsome confusion with the term Neo-Confucianism, which typically means\nSong-Ming Confucianism. All these terms\u2014modern Confucianism,\ncontemporary Confucianism, and New Confucianism\u2014are used to\ntranslate the common Chinese terms for this period, dangdai xin\nruxue \u7576\u4ee3\u65b0\u5112\u5b78 or xiandai xin\nrujia \u73fe\u4ee3\u65b0\u5112\u5bb6. A growing number\nof scholars use \u201cRuism\u201d instead of\n\u201cConfucianism\u201d, as it is closer to the Chinese terms.\nHowever, Confucianism remains the more familiar English term.\n\nModern Confucianism is often called the third major era of Confucian\nthought (MZCW 9a: 1\u201317; Tu 1993: 141\u201359). The first\nclassical period was from around 500 BCE to the first or second\ncentury CE, and the second wave was the Song-Ming period. The defining\ncharacteristics of modern Confucianism are, as the name implies, a\nconcern with modernity and what that should mean for Chinese culture,\nand significant engagement with Western philosophy, primarily European\nEnlightenment and post-Enlightenment thought (Ro\u0161ker 2016; Tan\n2009; Van den Stock 2016). Modern Confucian thinkers merged historical\nanalysis with novel interpretations and theories for adapting\nConfucian thought to a vastly different world. This entry will sketch\nthe historical background of modern Confucianism and introduce the\nmajor figures included, then go on to examine their views on modernity\nand tradition, knowledge, human nature, and politics.\n",
