    "main_text": "Introduction and Background\n2. Introduction and Background\n\nFrom the seventeenth century onward, Galileo has been seen by many as\nthe \u201chero\u201d of modern science. He is renowned for his\ndiscoveries: he was the first to report telescopic observations of the\nmountains on the moon, the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and\nthe rings of Saturn. He invented an early microscope and a predecessor\nto the thermometer. In mathematical physics\u2014a discipline he\nhelped create\u2014he calculated the law of free fall, conceived of\nan inertial principle, determined the parabolic trajectory of\nprojectiles, and advocated the relativity of motion. He is thought to\nbe the first \u201creal\u201d experimental scientist, who dropped\nstones from towers and ships\u2019 masts, and played with magnets,\nclocks, and pendulums (noting the isochrony of the latter). Much of\nhis cultural stature also arises from his advocacy and popularization\nof Copernicanism and the resulting condemnation by the Catholic\nInquisition, which has made him a purported \u201cmartyr\u201d to\nthe cause of rationality and enlightened modernity in the subsequent\nhistory of a supposed \u201cwarfare\u201d between science and\nreligion. This is no small set of accomplishments for one\nseventeenth-century Italian, who was the son of a court musician and\nwho left the University of Pisa without a degree.\n\nMomentous figures living in momentous times are full of interpretive\nfecundity, and Galileo has been the subject of manifold\ninterpretations and much controversy. The use of Galileo\u2019s work\nand the invocations of his name make a fascinating history\n(Segre 1991; Palmerino and Thijssen 2004; Finocchiaro 2005; Shea\nand Artigas 2006), but this is not our topic, which are the\nphilosophical implications of his work.\n\nPhilosophically, Galileo has been used to exemplify many different\nthemes, usually as a personification of whatever the writer wished to\nmake the hallmark of the Scientific Revolution or of the nature of\ngood science\u2014whatever was good about the new science or science\nin general, it was Galileo who started it. One tradition of Galileo\nscholarship has divided Galileo\u2019s work into three or four parts:\n(1) his physics, (2) his astronomy, and (3) his methodology, which\nmight include his method of Biblical interpretation and/or his\nthoughts about the nature of proof or demonstration. In this\ntradition, typical treatments deal with his physical and astronomical\ndiscoveries and their background and/or who were Galileo\u2019s\npredecessors. More philosophically, many ask how his mathematical\npractice relates to his natural philosophy. Was he a mathematical\nPlatonist (Jardine 1976; Koyr\u00e9 1978), an experimentalist\n(Settle 1967; Settle 1983; Settle 1992; Palmieri 2008), an\nAristotelian emphasizing experience (Geymonat 1954), a precursor of\nmodern positivist science (Drake 1978), or maybe an Archimedean\n(Machamer 1998a), who might have used a revised Scholastic method of\nproof (Wallace 1992; Miller 2018)? Or did he have no method and just\nfly like an eagle in the way that geniuses do (Feyerabend 1975)?\nAlongside these claims there have been attempts to place Galileo in an\nintellectual context that brings out the background to his\nachievements. Some have emphasized his debt to the artisan/engineer\npractical tradition (Rossi 1962; Valleriani 2010), others his\nmathematics (Giusti 1993; Feldhay 1998; Renn, et al. 2000; Palmieri\n2001; Palmieri 2003; Peterson 2011; Palmerino 2016), his mixed (or\nsubalternate) mathematics (Machamer 1978; Lennox 1986; Wallace 1992;\nDear 1995; Machamer 1998a), his debt to atomism (Shea 1972; Redondi\n1983), his use of Hellenistic and Medieval impetus theory (Moody 1951;\nDuhem 1954; Clagett 1959; Shapere 1974), or the idea that discoveries\nbring new data into science (Wootton 2015).\n\nStill, almost everyone working in this tradition seems to think the\nthree areas\u2014physics, astronomy, and methodology\u2014are\nsomewhat distinct and represent different Galilean endeavors. More\nrecent historical research has followed contemporary intellectual\nfashion and shifted foci, bringing new dimensions to our understanding\nof Galileo by studying his rhetoric (Finocchiaro 1980; Moss 1993;\nFeldhay 1998; Spranzi 2004), the power structures of his social milieu\n(Biagioli 1993; Biagioli 2006), his personal quest for acknowledgment\n(Shea and Artigas 2003), and more generally emphasizing the larger\nsocial and cultural history (Reeves 2008; Bucciantini, et al. 2015),\nin particular the court and papal culture in which Galileo\nfunctioned (Redondi 1983; Heilbron 2010).\n\nIn an intellectualist recidivist mode, this entry will outline his\ninvestigations in physics and astronomy and exhibit, in a new way, how\nthese all cohered in a unified inquiry. In setting out this path, we\nshall show why, at the end of his life, Galileo felt compelled (in\nsome sense of necessity) to write the Two New Sciences,\nwhich stands as a true completion of his overall project and is not\njust a reworking of his earlier research that he reverted to after his\ntrial, when he was under house arrest and going blind. Particularly,\nwe shall try to show why both of the two new sciences,\nespecially the first, were so important\u2014a topic not much\ntreated except recently (Biener 2004; Raphael 2011). In\npassing, we shall touch on his methodology and his mathematics, and\nhere refer you to some of the recent work by Palmieri (2001; 2003). At\nthe end, we shall add some words about Galileo, the Catholic Church,\nand his trial.\n",
