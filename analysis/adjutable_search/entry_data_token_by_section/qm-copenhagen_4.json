    "main_text": "The Use of Classical Concepts\n5. The Use of Classical Concepts\n\nA central element in the Copenhagen Interpretation is Bohr\u2019s\ninsistence on the use of classical concepts both with respect to\ndescribing experimental results and endowing quantum formalism with an\nempirical interpretation. The special cognitive status ascribed to the\nclassical concepts is something Bohr stressed from the very beginning.\nHere is a quotation from 1934: \n\n\nNo more is it likely that the fundamental concepts of the classical\ntheories will ever become superfluous for the description of physical\nexperience. \u2026 It continues to be the application of these\nconcepts alone that makes it possible to relate the symbolism of the\nquantum theory to the data of experience (ATDN, p.16).\n Later he expressed the same view in an often quoted\npassage:\n\n\n\nIt is decisive to recognize that, however far the phenomena transcend\nthe scope of classical physical explanation, the account of all\nevidence must be expressed in classical terms. The argument is simply\nthat by the word \u2018experiment\u2019 we refer to a situation\nwhere we can tell to others what we have done and what we have learned\nand that, therefore, the account of the experimental arrangement and\nof the results of the observations must be expressed in unambiguous\nlanguage with suitable application of the terminology of classical\nphysics (APHK, p. 39). \n\n\nBohr saw the classical concepts as necessary for procuring unambiguous\ncommunication about what happens in the laboratory. Classical concepts\nare indispensable, because they enable physicists to describe\nobservations in a clear common language, and because they are the ones\nby which the physicists connect the mathematical formalism with\nobservational content.\n\nOver the years, different authors have come up with different\nexplanations of why Bohr thought that classical concepts were\nunavoidable for the description of quantum phenomena. Here we\nshall group those explanations in relation to five different\nphilosophical frameworks: 1) Empiricism, 2) Kantianism, 3) Pragmatism,\n4) Darwinianism, and 5) Experimentalism.\n\nEmpiricism. This view is represented by the logical\npositivists. They believed that the interpretation of any scientific\ntheory should be grounded in empirical observations. No theory,\naccording the positivists, is cognitively meaningful unless its terms\ncan be connected to terms that are able to express results that would\nverify that theory. Observational terms refer directly to observable\nthings or observable properties of physical objects, whereas\ntheoretical terms are explicitly defined by correspondence rules\nconnecting them with the observational terms. Hence classical terms,\nlike position and momentum, are exactly such terms that enable\nphysicist to ascribe a physical meaning to quantum mechanics.\n\nKantianism. Many philosophers and physicists have recognized\na strong kinship between Kant and Bohr\u2019s thinking or a direct\nKantian influence on Bohr. In the thirties C.F. von Weizs\u00e4cker\nand Grete Hermann attempt to understand complementarity in the light\nof neo-Kantian ideas. As von Weizs\u00e4cker puts it many years later,\n\u201cThe alliance between Kantians and physicists was premature in\nKant\u2019s time, and still is; in Bohr, we begin to perceive its\npossibility\u201d. A series of modern scholars (Folse 1985; Honner\n1982, 1987; Faye 1991; Kaiser 1992; Chevalley 1994; Pringe 2009;\nCuffaro 2010; Bitbol 2013, 2017; and Kauark-Leite 2017) has also\nemphasized the Kantian parallels. Although these scholars find common\nthemes, they also disagree to what extent Kantian or neo-Kantian ideas\ncan be used as spectacles through which we may vision Bohr\u2019s\nunderstanding of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, Cuffaro (2010)\nholds that any proper \u201cinterpretation of Bohr should\nstart with Kant\u201d, and that \u201ccomplementarity\nfollows naturally from a broadly Kantian epistemological\nframework.\u201d Kant\u2019s assumption was that our forms of\nintuition and our categories of thoughts constitute the transcendental\nconditions for the possibility of any objective experience. Thus,\nspace and time are referred to as the forms of intuition, and the\ncategories of understanding such as causation, unity, plurality, and\ntotality are the a priori concepts which the mind imposes on the sense\nimpressions that appear in our intuition. In a similar way, it is\nargued that Bohr saw concepts like space, time, causation, unity, and\ntotality as a priori categories that was necessary for any objective\ndescription of quantum phenomena, and that classical physics was an\nexplication and operationalization of these a priori concepts. \n\n Pragmatism. Some scholars have advocated for a more\npragmatic explanation of Bohr\u2019s thesis concerning the\nindispensability of classical concepts. Here the interpretation\nfocuses on how we experimentally get to know something about atoms. We\nfind out about atoms by interacting with atomic systems, not by\npicturing them, and the interaction are accounted for in terms of\nexperiential categories. The pragmatists typically reject the a priori\nstatus of the mind\u2019s categories as they take them to be\ncontingent. From a physical perspective it is a simple matter of facts\nthat we need classical language to understand our scientific practise;\nit does not require any philosophical justification (Dieks 2017).\nLikewise, Dorato (2017) compares Bohr\u2019s indispensable thesis to\nPeter Strawson\u2019s descriptive metaphysics according to which we\nall share a common conceptual scheme about the experiential world which\ncannot be given a further justification. Also Folse notes, in a\ncomparison between Bohr and I.C. Lewis, that classical concepts reflect\nour empirical needs and shared interests and may eventually change if\nthese needs and interests change (Folse 2017). The common language\ntogether with the development of a physical clarification of some\nbasic empirical concepts gave us the classical physics because such an\nimproved language enables us to communicate in an unambiguous and\nobjective manner about our observations. As Bohr puts it: \u201c...\neven when the phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical\ntheories, the account of the experimental arrangement and the\nrecording of observations must be given in plain language, suitably\nsupplemented by technical physical terminology. This is a clear\nlogical demand, since the very word \u201dexperiment\u201c refers to\na situation where we can tell others what we have done and what we\nhave learned.\u201d (APHK, p. 71). The use of classical\nconcepts to grasp the world is beneficial for understanding each\nother. Such empirical concepts provide us with an objective\ndescription of the function and outcome of physical experiments.\n\nDarwinism. In several places Bohr speaks about the classical\nconcepts as embodied in our common language, which is adapted\nto account for our physical experiences. The selection of the\nword \u201cadapted to\u201d seems to indicate that Bohr relied on\nDarwin\u2019s theory of natural selection in his search for an\nexplanation. The classical concepts are indispensable for the\ndescription of our experience because we are forced by nature to use a\ncommon language that is adapted to reporting our visual\nexperiences, which again is a result of humans\u2019 adaptation to\ntheir physical environment (Faye, 2017). Apart from Bohr\u2019s use\nof the word \u201cadapted to\u201d, Bohr\u2019s former assistant\nLeon Rosenfelt, who was an ardent defender of Bohr\u2019s\ncomplementarity, explicitly suggests that \u201cthe complementary\nlogic\u201d is due to human evolution: \u201cI suspect the\ndevelopment of a computing and communication system like our brain\ndemands about that complexity of organization which has been reached\nby our own species in the course of evolution\u201d (Rosenfeld,\n(1961 [1979]), p.515). Natural selection installs certain permanent\nvisual cognitive schemes in our predecessors, and this cognitive\nadaptation explains why these schemes, later reflected in our common\nlanguage, gain a privileged epistemic status, and keep this status in\nphysics in terms of refined classical concepts.\n\nExperimentalism. Camilleri (2017) calls Bohr the philosopher\nof experiment. Others such as Perovic (2013) have also suggested that\nBohr was more occupied by understanding the outcome of quantum\nexperiments than by interpreting the quantum formalism. In his paper\nCamilleri proposes that the challenge Bohr was facing was that, on the\none hand, experimental observation requires a sharp separation of the\nexperiment and the observed object, and, on the other hand, because of\nwhat we today call entanglement, \u201cit is no longer possible\nsharply to distinguish between the autonomous behaviour of a physical\nobject and its inevitable interaction with other bodies serving as\nmeasuring instruments\u201d (CC, p.84). So, according to\nCamilleri, Bohr solved this challenge by making a distinguish between\nthe function and the structure of an experiment. \n\n\nBohr\u2019s central insight was that if a measuring instrument is to\nserve its purpose of furnishing us with knowledge of an\nobject \u2013 that is to say, if it is to be described\nfunctionally \u2013 it must be described classically. Of course, it\nis always possible to represent the experimental apparatus from a\npurely structural point of view as a quantum-mechanical system without\nany reference to its function. However, any functional description of\nthe experimental apparatus, in which it is treated as a means to an\nend, and not merely as a dynamical system, must make use of the\nconcepts of classical physics (Camilleri, 2017, pp.30\u201331).\n\n\nThis analysis explains not only why Bohr thought that classical\nconcepts were indispensable for interpretational purposes, but also\nindicates why he thought that properties like momentum, position, and\nduration could be attributed only to an atom object in relation to a\nspecific experimental arrangement. As Dieks (2017) mentions while\ndenying any deeper philosophical motivation on Bohr\u2019s part: the\nuse of classical concepts is part of the laboratory life. \u201cThis\nclassical description is basically just the description in terms of\neveryday language, generalized by the addition of physics terminology,\nand it is the one we de facto use to describe our\nenvironment\u201d (Dieks 2017). But because of quantum of action,\nsymbolized by Planck\u2019s constant, the function of experiments\nthat supply the physicists with exact information about space-time\ncoordinations is incompatible with experiments whose function it is to\nsupply them with exact information about energy and momentum.\n\nIndeed, there are both similarities and overlaps between some of the\nproposed explanations concerning the indispensability of classical\nconcepts. Yet, not all of the suggested explanations can be true. Even\nthough the aim of Bohr\u2019s effort is to give an empirical\ninterpretation of the quantum formalism, his empiricism is different\nfrom that of the logical positivists. He does not seek to reduce terms\nconcerning theoretical entities to terms about sense-data or purely\nperceptual phenomena. He insists only that the empirical evidence\nphysicists collect from their experiments on atomic objects has to be\ndescribed in terms of the same concepts which were developed in\nclassical mechanics in order for them to understand what the quantum\ntheory is all about.\n\nNevertheless, the various explanations all give us some hints into the\ncomplexity of Bohr\u2019s thinking concerning the description of\nphysical experiments. At different times, he seems to put emphasis on\none aspect rather than another, depending on the specific context of\ndiscussion. Sometimes he was occupied with the interpretation of\nexperiments, sometimes with the relationship between actual\nexperiments and the formulation of quantum mechanics. In emphasizing\nthe necessity of classical concepts for the description of quantum\nphenomena, Bohr might have been influenced by Kantian-like ideas or\nneo-Kantianism (Hooker, 1994). But if so, he was a naturalized or a\npragmatized Kantian. The classical concepts are merely explications of\ncommon-sense concepts that are already a result of our perceptual\nadaptation to the world. These concepts and the conditions of their\napplication determine the conditions for objective knowledge. The\ndiscovery of the quantization of action has revealed to us, however,\nthat we cannot apply these concepts to quantum objects as we did in\nclassical physics. The use of classical concepts in the domain of\nquantum mechanics has to be restricted with respect to their use in\nclassical mechanics. Now kinematic and dynamic properties (represented\nby conjugate variables) can be meaningfully ascribed to the object\nonly in relation to some actual experimental results, whereas\nclassical physics attributes such properties to the object regardless\nof whether we actually observe them or not. In other words, Bohr\ndenied that classical concepts could be used to attribute properties\nto a physical world in-itself behind the perceptual phenomena, i.e.\nproperties different from those being observed. In contrast, classical\nphysics rests on an idealization, he said, in the sense that it\nassumes that the physical world has these properties in-itself, i.e.\nas inherent properties, independent of their actual observation.\n",
