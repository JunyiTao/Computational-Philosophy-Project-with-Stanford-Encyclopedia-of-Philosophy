Mechanical properties\n\nStrange things can happen when one carries out an infinite task.\n\nFor example, consider a hotel with a countably infinite number of\nrooms. One night when the hotel is completely occupied, a traveler\nshows up and asks for a room. \u201cNo problem,\u201d the\nreceptionist replies, \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of space!\u201d The first\noccupant then moves to the second room, the second to the third room,\nthe third to the fourth room, and so on all the way up. The result is\na hotel that has gone from being completely occupied to having one\nroom free, and the traveler can stay the night after all. This\nsupertask was described in a 1924 lecture by David Hilbert, as\nreported by Gamow (1947).\n\nOne might take such unusual results as evidence against the\npossibility of supertasks. Alternatively, we might take them to seem\nstrange because our intuitions are based on experience with finite\ntasks, and which break down in the analysis of supertasks. For now,\nlet us simply try to come to grips with some of the unusual mechanical\nproperties that supertasks can have.\n",
