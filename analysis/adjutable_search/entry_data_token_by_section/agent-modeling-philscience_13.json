    "main_text": "Common Modeling Frameworks || Bounded confidence models of opinion dynamics\n3.3 Bounded confidence models of opinion dynamics\n\nAs we have seen above, the performance of a scientific community is\nsometimes assessed in terms of its success in achieving consensus on\nthe true hypothesis. The question how consensus is formed and which\nfactors benefit or hinder its emergence is also studied within the\ntheme of opinion dynamics in epistemic communities. Models of\nopinion dynamics aim at investigating how opinions form and change in\na group of agents who adjust their views (or beliefs) over a number of\nrounds or time-steps, resulting in the formation of\nconsensus, polarization, or a plurality of\nviews. A modeling framework that has been particularly influential in\nthis context originates from the work of Hegselmann and Krause (2002,\n2005, 2006), drawing its roots from analytical models of consensus\nformation (French 1956; DeGroot 1974; Lehrer & Wagner\n 1981).[3]\n\n\nThe basic model functions as follows. At the start of the simulation\n(that is, at time \\(t=0\\)) each agent \\(x_i\\) is assigned an opinion\non a certain issue, expressed by a real number \\(x_i(0) \\in {(0,1]}\\).\nAgents then exchange their opinions (or beliefs) with others and\nadjust them by taking the average of those beliefs that are \u201cnot\ntoo far away\u201d from their own. These are opinions that fall\nwithin a \u201cconfidence interval\u201d of size \\(\\epsilon\\), which\nis a parameter of the model. In this way, agents have bounded\nconfidence in opinions of others. By iterating this process, the model\nsimulates the social dynamics of the opinion formation (see\n Figure 5a).\n\nApplied to the context of scientific inquiry, scientists are usually\nrepresented as truth seeking agents who are trying to determine the\nvalue of a certain parameter \\(\\tau\\) for which they only know that it\nlies in the interval \\((0,1]\\) (Hegselmann & Krause 2006). At the\nstart of the simulation each agent is assigned a random initial\nbelief. As the model runs, agents adjust their beliefs by receiving a\n(noisy) signal about \\(\\tau\\) and by learning opinions of others who\nfall within their confidence interval. For instance, an agent\u2019s\nbelief can be updated in terms of the weighted average of\nothers\u2019 opinions and the signal from the\n world.[4]\n Such dynamics represent scientists as agents who are able to generate\nevidence that points in the direction of \\(\\tau\\), though their\nupdates are also influenced by their prior beliefs and the beliefs of\ntheir peers (see\n Figure 5b\n &\n Figure 5c).\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 5: Examples of runs of Hegselmann\nand Krause\u2019s model, with the x-axis representing time\nsteps in the simulation and the y-axis opinions of 100 agents.\nThe change of each agent\u2019s opinion is represented with a colored\nline. The value of \\(\\tau\\) (the assumed position of the truth) is\nrepresented as a black dotted line. Figure (a) shows opinion dynamics\nin a community without any truth-seeking agents, resulting in a\nplurality of diverging views. Figure (b) shows the opinion dynamics in\na community in which all agents are truth-seekers, which achieves a\nconsensus close to the truth. Figure (c) shows the opinion dynamics in\na community in which only half of the population are truth-seekers,\nwhich also achieves a consensus close to the truth (adapted from\nHegselmann & Krause 2006; for other parameters used in the\nsimulations see the original article).\n\n\nAn early application of the bounded confidence model was the problem\nof the division of cognitive labor (Hegselmann & Krause 2006).\nSince agents can be modeled as updating their beliefs only on the\nbasis of social information (that is, by averaging over opinions of\nothers who fall in one\u2019s confidence interval) or on the basis of\nboth social information and the signal from the world, the model can\nbe used to study the opinion dynamics in a community in which not\neveryone is a \u201ctruth-seeker\u201d. The model then examines what\nkind of division of labor between truth-seekers and agents who only\nreceive social information allows the community to converge to the\ntruth.\n\nSubsequent applications of the framework in social epistemology and\nphilosophy of science focused on the study of scientific disagreements\nand the question: what is the impact of different norms guiding\ndisagreeing scientists on the efficiency of collective inquiry (Douven\n2010; De Langhe 2013)? If agents update their beliefs both in view of\ntheir own research and in view of other agents\u2019 opinions they\nrepresent scientists that follow a Conciliatory Norm by\n\u201csplitting the difference\u201d between their own view and the\nviews of their peers (see above\n Section 2.5).\n In contrast, if they update their beliefs only in view of their own\nresearch they represent scientists that follow a Steadfast Norm. Other\napplication themes of this framework include the impact of noisy data\non opinion dynamics (Douven & Riegler 2010), opinion dynamics\nconcerning complex belief states, such as beliefs about scientific\ntheories (Riegler & Douven 2009), updating via an inference to the\nbest explanation in a social setting (Douven & Wenmackers 2017),\ndeceit and spread of disinformation (Douven & Hegselmann 2021),\nnetwork effects and theoretical diversity in scientific communities\n(Douven & Hegselmann 2022), and so forth.\n",
