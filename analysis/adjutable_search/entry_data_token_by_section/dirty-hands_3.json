    "main_text": "A Conflict Within Morality?\n4. A Conflict Within Morality?\n\nAnother route out of paradox would be to hold that the clash depicted\nby dirty hands theorists occurs within morality. Here, the idea might\nbe that morality itself is not entirely coherent or self-consistent.\nIn certain extreme circumstances, one powerful strand in morality\ncomes into conflict with another. Even more clearly, Weber\u2019s\ndistinction between the ethics of ultimate ends and that of\nresponsibility points in this direction. His idea is expressed\nsomewhat opaquely, but he seems to be claiming that there are two\nstrands in morality, or two types of morality, such that one may be\napplicable to ordinary life, but must yield to the other in matters\npolitical, especially those that involve difficult choices in a\ncontext of violence. Several passages in Walzer\u2019s discussion\ntend in this direction. He holds that a morality of rights and a\nmorality of consequences or utility co-exist in our moral outlook in\nsuch a way that although rights trump utility in normal circumstances,\na \u201cutilitarianism of extremity\u201d rightly overrides the\nmorality of rights in some rare circumstances. As he puts it: in a\nsituation of supreme emergency, \u201ca certain kind of\nutilitarianism reimposes itself\u201d, this being \u201cthe\nutilitarianism of extremity\u201d set against \u201ca rights\nnormality\u201d (Walzer 2004a, 40).\n\nThis contrast between a rights ethic (or other deontological ethic)\nand utilitarianism is one way of locating the clash within morality\nitself. Another way is by having recourse to role morality: within\nmorality itself there are general moral principles, rules etc. and\nthen special moral requirements dictated by significant social roles.\nThese can come into conflict, as when the lawyer\u2019s obligation to\nprovide her client with the best defence and to preserve\nconfidentiality can conflict with the demands of impartial justice. So\nit might be argued that the political role has obligations and rights\nspecial to it that override more general moral obligations and rights.\nWhen it comes to the immensely important role of political leadership,\nwe \u201ccannot measure such men by the ordinary rule\u201d as Lady\nCarbury puts it. This manoeuvre has the advantage of capturing\nsomething important in the dirty hands literature (and it is also\npresent in the realist literature), namely, the emphasis on the\nspecial moral significance of the role of political leadership.\nWalzer, for instance, places great weight upon \u201cwhat political\nleaders are for.\u201d Talking of political and military leaders, he\nsays, \u201cThe effect of the supreme emergency arguments should be\nto reinforce professional ethics, and to provide an account of when it\nis permissible (and necessary) to get our hands dirty\u201d (Walzer\n2004a, 42). An initial problem with this sort of move is that the\nspecial duties and rights of social roles are underpinned by general\nmoral considerations since it is only those roles that can be morally\nsupported by quite general moral considerations that will have a role\nmorality. We may describe the code of the Mafia thug as the morality\nof his role, but usually it is mores rather morality being described.\nEven if it is a requirement of his role that a Mafia hit-man must\nmurder anyone who snitches to the police, this is hardly a moral\nimperative of any sort. And where there are genuine moral duties to a\nrole, and they are endorsed by broader moral considerations, we do not\nbelieve that this endorsement cannot itself be overruled by other\ngeneral moral obligations. The requirements of professional\nconfidentiality, for instance, can be so overridden, as when medical\nconfidentiality regarding a doctor-patient communication stands in the\nway of saving a life. The famous Tarasof case is instructive in this\nrespect. It concerned a counsellor at the University of California at\nBerkeley who learned from his client that he planned to kill his\nex-girl friend. The counsellor was sufficiently worried that he broke\nconfidentiality to tell the police who investigated but took no\nfurther action. The girl friend (Tarasof) was duly murdered by the\nclient, and a court later held that the counsellor should have gone\nfurther and notified Tarasof or her family of the\n danger.[5]\n Other courts have been less demanding, but there is a general\nrecognition that the professional duty of client confidentiality can\nbe overridden by more pressing moral demands.\n\nIndeed, the structure of the role morality defence of the dirty hands\nstory provides a curious inversion of the role morality logic since\nthat logic requires that emergency situations allow or even demand the\noverturning of the role duties by the more general demands of a deeper\nmorality. By contrast, the dirty hands scenario requires the role\nmorality to triumph over the deeper moral outlook that gives sense to\nthe morality of role itself. Here we find yet another paradox\ngenerated by the dirty hands category. It could only be resolved by\nthe insistence that the political role is unique among roles since in\nits case its moral power somehow transcends the general morality. (Or,\nif the dirty hands scenario applies beyond the political, it will be\none of a small set of roles that is unique.) In fact, there is a\nstrong strand of this political exceptionism inherent in the dirty\nhands story. Yet how could the political role have such a status? We\nmight expect such an exaltation of the role from one such as Schmitt,\nbut in fact Walzer himself is drawn to it. Walzer\u2019s position has\nbeen cited as treating the dirty hands conflict as involving a clash\nbetween a rights ethic and a utilitarianism of extremity, but the\nfollowing quote puts his position much more in the role morality\narena. He says in his later treatment: \u201cNo government can put\nthe life of the community and all its members at risk, so long as\nthere are actions available to it, even immoral actions, that would\navoid or reduce the risk\u2026.That is what political leaders are\nfor; that is their first task\u201d (Walzer 2004a, 42). Furthermore,\nthe significance of this task is cashed out in terms of the supreme\nvalue of the specific \u201cmoral community\u201d to which the\npolitical leader belongs. The leader\u2019s obligations will involve\ncalculations of utility, but, in extremis, his or her ultimate\nresponsibility to that community trumps universalist utilitarian\ncalculations as well as specific deontological constraints. When the\n\u201congoingness\u201d of a community\u2019s way of life is\nthreatened then the prospect is that of \u201ca loss greater than any\nthat can be imagined, except for the destruction of humanity\nitself\u201d (Walzer 2004a, 43). These claims, if true, would\ncertainly establish a pre-eminent, if not unique, significance for the\npolitical role, so they need close examination.\n\nWalzer\u2019s two quotes stress significantly different values that\nhe has a tendency to conflate. The first is that of life itself for\nall members of the community, the second that of the continuity of a\n\u201cway of life\u201d. Survival is at issue in both cases but the\nsignificance and weight that each survival should have is surely very\ndifferent. The prospect of universal massacre understandably puts\nstress upon anything constraining the scope of actions to prevent it,\nbut the prospect of forced alterations, set-backs or radical changes\nto a way of life must be less threatening. Even a relatively benign\nforeign occupation may involve extensive and very regrettable changes\nto the way of life of the occupied community perhaps in the form of\nrestrictions on traditional freedoms, such as those of political\nspeech or religious expression, and a degraded position of citizenship\nvis-\u00e0-vis the occupiers. Yet throughout history modified life\nstyles have evolved for such communities that make for the possibility\nof at least coping and even some flourishing. It is not at all obvious\nthat slaughtering innocent people is justified in order to avoid such\nan outcome, or even outcomes notably worse on the same scale.\n\nEven if dirty hands were permitted only to political communities\nfacing extreme situations, it is not at all clear that the exemption\nshould only be available to political communities that have states.\nWalzer does not exactly say this, but his pro-state bias is evident in\nhis discussion of supreme emergency in Just and Unjust Wars.\nEarly in that discussion, he says, for instance, \u201cCan soldiers\nand statesmen override the rights of innocent people for the sake of\ntheir own political community? I am inclined to answer this question\naffirmatively, though not without hesitation and worry\u201d (Walzer\n1977, 254). Further, in a different essay on terrorism, Walzer rejects\narguments on behalf of terrorism by non-state agents that are very\nsimilar to those that he accepts as legitimating the bombing of German\ncities. For example, he claims that the familiar terrorist excuse that\nthey had no alternative in the face of oppression is only \u201ca\npretence.\u201d As he puts it: \u201c\u2018Last resort\u2019 has\nonly a notional finality; the resort to terror is ideologically last,\nnot last in an actual series of actions, just last for the sake of the\nexcuse\u201d (Walzer 2004b, 54). Yet no such scepticism is expressed\nabout the no alternative and last resort justifications offered by\ngovernments who use terrorism in supreme emergency.\n\nBut political communities other than states may surely face supreme\nemergencies, even allowing for the difficulties in interpreting the\nconcept, so the way is open in principle for sub-state terrorism to be\njustified. This is a position that Walzer somewhat reluctantly seems\nnow (in a parenthesis to a later reprinting of the terrorism article)\nto concede, though it goes somewhat against the grain of the article\nitself. The parenthetical comments, published in 2004, are:\n\u201cWould terrorism be justified in a \u2018supreme\nemergency\u2019 as that condition is described [by Walzer in the\nearlier chapter called \u2018Emergency Ethics\u2019]. It might be,\nbut only if the oppression to which the terrorists claimed to be\nresponding was genocidal in character\u201d (Walzer 2004b, 54). There\nare difficulties in matching the complex meanings of\n\u201cgenocide\u201d to Walzer\u2019s communitarian account of\nsupreme emergency. For one thing, a Nazi victory would probably not\nhave meant genocide for the British community yet, according to\nWalzer, they were facing supreme emergency. So, the sources of his\ndifferential treatment of state and sub-state terrorism remain a\npuzzle.\n\nHe goes on to deny that any actual recent terrorism has been \u201ca\nmeans for avoiding disaster\u201d rather than merely a\n\u201creaching for political success\u201d (Walzer 2004b, 54). So\nthe supreme emergency/dirty hands exemption seems available, given\nsignificant qualifications concerning probability of success, for\nterrorists aiming to save a communal way of life. In a later paper\nagain, Walzer allows for exceptional cases in which sub-state\nterrorism might be excusable though not justifiable; he imagines as\nexcusable \u201ca terrorist campaign by Jewish militants against\nGerman civilians in the 1940s\u2014if attacks on civilians had been\nlikely (in fact they would have been highly unlikely) to stop the mass\nmurder of the Jews\u201d (Walzer 2006, 7). The shift from justifiable\nin the earlier quotation to excusable in the later clearly needs more\nexplanation; Walzer seems hesitant, if not confused in his resort to\nthese categories. Nonetheless, on Walzer\u2019s own grounds, there\nwould seem to be a case, given some likelihood of success, for the\nemployment of terrorism by Palestinian groups seeking to salvage what\nremains of their community\u2019s way of life from the ravages of\nIsraeli occupation, settlement and military attack. It is perhaps\npertinent to this prospect that the Palestinians refer to their\ndispossession and ongoing sufferings at the hands of Israel as\n\u201cal-Nakba\u201d: the catastrophe. No doubt, their achieving\nthat prospect would involve some sort of \u201creaching for political\nsuccess\u201d but this hardly counts against its status as a response\nto supreme emergency. The point here is not to make any particular\nclaims about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but rather to stress\nthe idea, noted earlier, that Walzer\u2019s move to a criterion of\ngenocide is puzzling as the sole interpretation of what a threat to\nthe continuity of a communal way of life could mean.\n\nWalzer\u2019s tendency to run together the categories of excuse and\njustification needs some comment because it is symptomatic of the\ntensions inherent in the dirty hands scenario. He realises in the 1973\narticle that it is important to distinguish them. Citing J.L. Austin,\nWalzer remarks that \u201cthe two can seem to come very close\ntogether\u2026but they are conceptually distinct\u2026an excuse is\ntypically an admission of fault; a justification is typically a denial\nof fault and an assertion of innocence\u201d (Walzer 1973, 170;\nWalzer 1974, 72). Yet dirty hands acts involve both an admission of\nfault and a justification. This tends to collapse the distinction\nsince what is justified needs no excuse and the unjustifiable is\nsometimes excusable. Walzer\u2019s discussion for the most part\nclearly treats the dirty hands decisions as justified in some sense,\nwhatever is said about its role as excuse. It is notable that at least\none commentator, Tamar Meisels, explicitly rejects the account in\nterms of justification in her discussion of terrorism and torture but\nshe accepts dirty hands as providing grounds for excuse (Meisels\n2008a, 213\u2013221). Yet not only is this an unlikely interpretation\nof the tradition, but it renders the category of dirty hands far less\ninteresting philosophically and ethically.\n\nThe discussion of the importance and extent of political community\nleads naturally to the question whether the need for dirty hands can\nbe restricted to the political sphere. If hands must be dirtied to\navoid widespread massacre, on the one hand, or damage to the\nmoral-cum-political continuity of a community\u2019s way of life,\nthen why not to avoid the unjustified killing of individuals or small\ngroups or the drastic disruption of individual or small group\u2019s\nway of living. Why should the political community and the political\nrole take such dramatic precedence over such significant groups as\nfamilies and their associated roles? For that matter, why should it\ntake precedence over the individual\u2019s need for survival\nregardless of role? The answer to this is not entirely clear. In\nWalzer\u2019s discussion of supreme emergency and the World War II\ncity bombings, he confronts this question but his discussion is marked\nby what he himself calls \u201chesitation and worry\u201d. It is\nalso marked by appeals to what people are \u201clikely to\nfeel\u201d, \u201cwhat is not usually said\u201d and similar\nphrases. He says: \u201c\u2026it is not usually said of individuals\nin domestic society that they necessarily will or that they morally\ncan strike out at innocent people, even in the supreme emergency of\nself-defense. They can only attack their attackers. But communities,\nin emergencies, seem to have different and larger prerogatives. I am\nnot sure that I can account for the difference, without ascribing to\ncommunal life a kind of transcendence that I don\u2019t believe it to\nhave\u201d (Walzer 1977, 254). Nor, he thinks, can it simply be a\nmatter of the numbers. Yet he persists with the superiority of the\npolitical community: \u201cWe might better say that it is possible to\nlive in a world where individuals are sometimes murdered, but a world\nwhere entire peoples are enslaved or massacred is literally\nunbearable. For the survival and freedom of political\ncommunities\u2014whose members share a way of life, developed by\ntheir ancestors, to be passed on to their children\u2014are the\nhighest values of international society\u201d (Walzer 1977, 254).\nLeaving aside the quibble that an individual facing murder won\u2019t\nfind it possible to live on if she is actually murdered when perhaps\nshe refuses to kill the innocent in order to survive, we might\nquestion the sensitivity of ignoring the way any murder victim\u2019s\nclose relatives find her death unbearable and the prospect of living\non an agonising one. We might also wonder why \u201cwe\u201d\ndon\u2019t find it unbearable to slaughter hundreds of thousands of\ninnocent people to preserve the survival and freedom of our political\ncommunities. Nor is the reference to \u201cthe highest values of\ninternational society\u201d particularly compelling. Where\n\u201cinternational society\u201d refers to the society of states,\nas Walzer seems often to mean, then it is not surprising that such\nstates hold their survival as a pre-eminent value, but non-state\nagents may understandably have different priorities. A mother\nscrounging for the survival of her children in the desperate\nconditions of a third-world slum or primitive refugee camp may just as\nplausibly see herself coming under what Walzer calls, in connection\nwith political communities, \u201cthe rule of necessity (and\nnecessity knows no rules)\u201d (Walzer 1977, 254).\n",
