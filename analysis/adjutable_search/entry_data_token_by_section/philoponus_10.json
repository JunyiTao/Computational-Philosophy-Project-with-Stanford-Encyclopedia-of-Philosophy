    "main_text": "Theological Treatises || Monophysitism\n4.2 Monophysitism\n\n\nJudging from the fragmentary evidence, Philoponus\u2019 later\ntheological treatises were characterized by a curious mixture of\nChristian doctrine and Aristotelian philosophy. On the eve of the\nfifth Council (Constantinople, 553) Philoponus stepped forward as a\npartisan of monophysite Christology which, in the course of the\ncentury, had become increasingly influential in the eastern part of\nthe Roman empire. For the monophysites it was important to emphasize the\ndivinity of Christ; they were alarmed by the bewildering conjunction of\nChristological dogmas formulated at the Council of Chalcedon in\n451. There Christ was confessed to be (1) consubstantial\n(homoo\u00fasios) with the Father, (2) consubstantial with\nus humans, (3) one person and one hyp\u00f3stasis (an\nimportant term widespread in Neoplatonism and roughly meaning\n\u2018substantive existence\u2019), but (4) discernible in two natures\n(en d\u00fao ph\u00fasesin \ngn\u00f4riz\u00f3menon), a phrase which was directly\ninfluenced by the \u2018unitatem personae in utraque natura\nintelligendam\u2019 (\u2018a unity of person knowable in both\nnatures\u2019) endorsed by the Bishop of Rome and familiar to\ntheologians of the Latin West. Although propositions 1, 2 and 3 were\nno longer controversial, proposition 4 could be read as an unholy\nconcession to those who regarded Jesus as a human being merely\ndistinguished by some kind of divine presence or inspiration (the view\nof the so-called \u2018dyophysites\u2019).\n\n In Arbiter (Arbitrator or Umpire), written about\nthe same time as the Council of Constantinople and surviving only in Syriac translation, Philoponus takes\nthe view that the locution \u2018discernible in two natures\u2019\nought to be abandoned. His main strategy is to argue that in this\ncontext the meaning of the terms \u2018nature\u2019 and\n\u2018hyp\u00f3stasis\u2019 are essentially identical, so that\nif Christ is (according to (3)) one hyp\u00f3stasis he\ncannot also (as in (4)) be discernible in two natures. The\nargument goes roughly as follows: The term \u2018nature\u2019 has two\napplications, one general and one particular: we can speak of the\nnature of man in general or of the particular nature of this\nindividual man. Now, when one speaks of the unification (and\ndiscernibility) of two natures in Christ, this cannot be meant to say\nthat the universal natures of godhead and manhood have been unified in\nChrist (else it would be also true to say that not only the Logos, but\nalso the Father and the Spirit have become man, since the universal\nnature of godhead applies to them as much as it does to the\nLogos). Instead, the reference must be to the particular nature of the\ndivine Logos and the particular nature of Jesus the man: it must be\nwith reference to these particular natures that godhead and manhood\nare combined in Christ. But this too cannot be right, Philoponus\nclaims, since \u2018particular nature\u2019 means the same as\n\u2018hyp\u00f3stasis\u2019, which he uses as a synonym also of\n\u2018person\u2019 and \u2018individual being\u2019. Since it is\nagreed that Christ is one person and one hyp\u00f3stasis,\nhe must consequently also be of one \u2018particular\u2019 nature\nonly, not two. Philoponus concedes, of course, that the nature of\nChrist is not an ordinary one; it is complex, combining and preserving\nthe properties of both what it is to be a god and what it is to be a\nman. Far from being able to discern two different natures in Christ,\nwe should speak of one complex or combined nature (m\u00eda ph\u00fasis\ns\u00fanthetos).\n",
