    "main_text": "Morality || The Moral Sense\n3.2 The Moral Sense\n\nFor Jefferson, morality was not reason-guided, but dictated by a moral\nsense. Here he followed Scottish\n empiricists,[14]\n such as William Small (Hull 1997: 102\u20135 and [Au]:\n4\u20135)\u2014the only non-minister at William and Mary\nCollege\u2014and Francis Hutcheson and especially Lord\n Kames.[15]\n\nTo nephew Peter Carr (19 Aug. 1785), Jefferson says that the god-given\nmoral sense, innate and instinctual, is as much a part of a\nperson\u2019s nature as are the senses of hearing and seeing, or as\nis a leg or arm. Jefferson\u2019s comparisons to hearing and sight\ninvite depiction of the moral sense tied to a bodily organ, like the\nheart (TJ to Maria Cosway, 12 Oct. 1785). Like strength of limbs, it\ntoo is given to persons in a greater or lesser degree, and can be made\nbetter or worse through exercise or its neglect.\n\nA letter to daughter Martha (11 Dec. 1783) suggests the moral sense\nworks spontaneously, without any input of reason. The language of\n\u201cfeel\u201d is critical.\n\n\nIf ever you are about to say any thing amiss or to do any thing wrong,\nconsider before hand. You will feel something within you which will\ntell you it is wrong and ought not to be said or done: this is your\nconscience, and be sure to obey\n it.[16]\n\n\nOne ought to resist the temptation to act viciously in circumstances\nwhen vice will not be detected. He tells Carr (19 Aug. 1785) to act\nalways and in all circumstances as if everyone in the world were\nlooking at him. Jefferson bids grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph (24\nNov. 1808) to appeal to moral exemplars before acting, and he lists\nSmall, Wythe, and Peyton Randolph. \u201cI am certain that this mode\nof deciding on my conduct, tended more to correctness than any\nreasoning powers I possessed.\u201d Thus, one can use the moral sense\nunerringly, or relatively so, if one disregards the intrusions of\nreason and assumes that all of one\u2019s actions are under the\nscrutiny of cynosures\u2014i.e., there will be no temptation to act\nfrom the pressure of peers. In another letter to Carr (10 Aug. 1787),\nJefferson disadvises his nephew to attend lectures on moral philosophy\nand appeals counterfactually to a ham-handed creator. \u201cHe who\nmade us would have been a pitiful bungler if he had made the rules of\nour moral conduct a matter of science.\u201d Here and\n elsewhere,[17]\n Jefferson is explicit that reason is uninvolved in moral\n\u201cjudgments.\u201d\n\nNot everyone possesses a moral sense. Napoleon, he tells Adams (25\nFeb. 1823), is an illustration. To Thomas Law (13 June 1814),\nJefferson says that want of the moral sense can somewhat be rectified\nby education and employment of rational calculation, but such\neducative remedies are blandishments not aimed to encourage morally\ncorrect action, because that is impossible without a moral sense, but\nto discourage actions with pernicious consequences. In short, one\nwithout a moral sense can be induced or shaped to behave as if having\na moral sense, though such actions would merely be consistent with\nmorally correct actions, not be morally correct actions.\n\nFinally, the function of reason, he says in his 1787 letter to Carr,\nis \u201cin some degree\u201d to oversee the exercise of the moral\nfaculty, \u201cbut it is a small stock which is required for\nthis\u201d. Reason might function, thinks one scholar, (1) to\nencourage or reinforce morally correct\n action,[18]\n (2) to keep the moral sense vital and vigorous, (3) to instill the\nfirst elements of morality in children through exposure to history,\n(4) to allow for cultural sensitivity to morally retarded cultures,\n(5) to continue moral advance through reading history as adults, (6)\nto help make plain the rights (especially derivative rights) of\nhumans, (7) to form general rules to serve as rough guides human\n action,[19]\n and (8) to encourage moral improvement through breeding for morality\n(Holowchak 2014b, 177\u201380). None of those functions, however,\ndirectly involves reason in moral \u201cjudgments.\u201d\n\nJefferson also believed, following the lead of many thinkers of his\nday\u2014e.g., Francis Ferguson, John Millar, Lord Kames (1798 and\n1774), William Robertson, Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius, the Marquis\nde Condorcet, and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot\u2014that humans were\nmorally progressing over time (e.g., TJ to John Adams, 11 Jan. 1816,\nand TJ to P.S. Dupont de Nemours, 24 Apr. 1816). There were, however,\nperiodic glitches\u2014periods of moral stagnation or decline. The\nbelligerence between England and France in Jefferson\u2019s later\nyears was to him evidence of such decline. Still, such moral\ndeclinations, considered overall, were temporary setbacks or\n\u201cretrogradations,\u201d not genuine declinations. In a letter\nto Adams (1 Aug. 1816), he writes that the Americas will show Europe\nthe path to moral advance.\n\n\nWe are destined to be a barrier against the returns of ignorance and\nbarbarism. Old Europe will have to lean on our shoulders, and to\nhobble along by our side, under the monkish trammels of priest and\nkings, as she can.\n\n\nThus, moral progress is movement, prompted by embrace of liberty and\nrespect for humans\u2019 rights, toward the ideals of love of deity\nand love of humanity through beneficence\u2014the ideals taught best\nby\n Jesus.[20]\n\n",
