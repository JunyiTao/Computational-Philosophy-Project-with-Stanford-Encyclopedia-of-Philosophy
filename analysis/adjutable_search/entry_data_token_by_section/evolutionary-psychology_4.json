Moral Psychology and Evolutionary Psychology\n\nMany philosophers who work on moral psychology understand that their\ntopic is empirically constrained. Philosophers take two main\napproaches to using empirical results in moral psychology. One is to\nuse empirical results (and empirically based theories from psychology)\nto criticize philosophical accounts of moral psychology (see e.g.\nDoris 2002) and one is to generate (and, in the experimental\nphilosophy tradition, to test) hypotheses about our moral psychology\n(see e.g. Nichols 2004). For those who think that some (or all) of our\nmoral psychology is based in innate capacities, evolutionary\npsychology is a good source of empirical results and empirically based\ntheory. One account of the make-up of our moral psychology follows\nfrom the massive modularity account of the architecture of the mind.\nOur moral judgments are a product of domain specific psychological\nmodules that are adaptations and arose in our hominid forebears in\nresponse to contingencies in our (mostly) social environments. This\nposition is currently widely discussed by philosophers working in\nmoral psychology. An example of this discussion follows.\n\nCosmides (see e.g. 1989) defends a hypothesis in evolutionary\npsychology that we have a cheater-detection\nmodule.[10]\nThis module is hypothesized to underlie important components of our\nbehavior in moral domains and fits with the massively modular view of\nour psychology in general. Cosmides (along with Tooby) argues that\ncheating is a violation of a particular kind of conditional rule that\ngoes along with a social contract. Social exchange is a system of\ncooperation for mutual benefit and cheaters violate the social\ncontract that governs social exchange (Cosmides and Tooby 2005). The\nselection pressure for a dedicated cheater-detection module is the\npresence of cheaters in the social world. The cheater-detection module\nis an adaptation that arose in response to cheaters. The\ncheater-detection hypothesis has been the focus of a huge amount of\ncritical discussion. Cosmides and Tooby (2008) defend the idea that\ncheat detection is modular over hypotheses that more general rules of\ninference are involved in the kind of reasoning behind cheater\ndetection against critics Ron Mallon (2008) and Fodor (2008). Some\ncriticism of the cheater-detection hypothesis involves rehashing\ncriticisms of massive modularity in general and some treats the\nhypothesis as a contribution to moral psychology and invokes different\nconsiderations. For example, Mallon (2008) worries about the coherence\nof abandoning a domain general conception of ought in our conception\nof our moral psychology. This discussion is also ongoing. (See e.g.\nSterelny 2012 for a selection of alternate, non-modular explanations\nof aspects of our moral psychology.)\n",
