    "main_text": "Ethics and Religion || Ethical Mitzvoth\n6.1 Ethical Mitzvoth\n\nAs we have noted, much as Kant does for moral value, Leibowitz locates\nthe religious value of our acts in our intentions. Holiness, he tells\nus, \u201cis nothing but halakhic observance; the specific\nintentional acts dedicated to the service of God\u201d\n(Judaism, 24, emphasis added). Presumably then, mitzvoth\ncould be performed for the sake of worshipping God and yet have\nincidental benefit to us. As long as the motivation is the worship of\nGod, any incidental benefits would surely be legitimate, or at least\nnot rule out the act as religiously worthy. What matters here is the\nhierarchy of values \u2013 observance of mitzvoth cannot be\nsubordinated to ethical values. Leibowitz\u2019s\nintentionalism dictates that religious acts, even if they incidentally\nsatisfy certain human needs, would still not be ethical acts given\ntheir religious motivation.\n\nThe idea of ethical mitzvoth, however, now becomes an oxymoron for\nLeibowitz. An act is either religious or ethical. Even \u201cYou\nshall love your neighbor as yourself,\u201d is to be regarded as a\nmitzvah, not as an ethical precept. The key phrase in the verse\ncontaining this commandment for Leibowitz is that which follows\nimmediately to end the verse: \u201cI am God.\u201d It is a duty\ntowards one\u2019s neighbor that is based on man\u2019s position\nbefore God, not his position before his fellow man.\n\nOne of Leibowitz\u2019s concerns is that for imperatives to be truly\ncategorical, they must draw their authority from something other than\nhuman needs and values, which are too weak a foundation to ground\ncategorical imperatives. One can always excuse oneself with the claim\nthat other people\u2019s needs are not overriding in any given\nsituation. There is no escape, however, from the authority of a divine\ndemand, so locating ethical imperatives within a religious system\ngives them the necessary foundation. Their position as commandments\ntransforms them from \u201cmere good counsel, a noble aspiration, or\na sublime ideal,\u201d and instead gives them \u201cthe reality of\nlaw, something one is compelled to take seriously as one must take a\npolice ordinance seriously\u201d (Judaism, 19). Yet given\nhis intentionalism, for Leibowitz this must simultaneously deprive an\nact of its ethical character. Acting for noble ideals, while\nlegitimate, would still render acts ethical, not religious.\n\nThis raises a problem for Leibowitz, since it is not clear that it can\ndo justice to the ethical prescriptions of the Torah qua ethical\nprescriptions. Ought I to act justly towards my neighbor out of my\nconcern for him, or out of concern for God? While it seems clear that\nLeibowitz could only see the latter as a religious act, it is not\nclear that this sits comfortably with our ethical intuitions \u2013\nthough presumably Leibowitz would simply retort that this is precisely\nwhat it means to subordinate human interest to the ultimate value that\nis the worship of God. While a Levinasian squaring of the circle would\nallow that our ethical concern for the other is itself a mark\nof transcendence, for Leibowitz, a religious act, even if it may serve\none\u2019s fellow man incidentally, can neither be motivated by such\na goal, nor allow such goals to play a role in our understanding of it\nas a mitzvah, since this would render God the slave of human\ninterests.\n\nThe question that arises, however, is whether in the case of ethically\nmotivated acts that coincide with mitzvoth, a Jew ought to have\ninstead performed the act for religious reasons \u2013 a position\nthat would not leave much room for a religious person to perform an\nethical action. Indeed, it would seem that if one wishes to\nperform the mitzvah of, for example, \u201cloving one\u2019s\nneighbor,\u201d one ought not to be acting based on ethical\nmotives. As such, it is not clear what becomes of the legitimacy of\nthe ethical realm for a religious Jew, since every ethically motivated\nact constitutes a missed opportunity for the worship of God. Each act\nought to be religiously rather than ethically motivated, even when the\nmere act itself would be the same. While it is not as if one who is\nethically motivated can sincerely transform that ethical motivation\ninto a religious one, it seems as if becoming the type of person who\nnaturally acts religiously in such cases would have to be the ultimate\naim for Leibowitz. This would not deny all value to ethically\nmotivated acts, but it certainly seems to problematize those that\ncoincide with specific mitzvoth for Jews qua Jews. Though\nhappily the demands of the two realms often coincided,\nLeibowitz\u2019s picture, it seems, leads to the problematic\nconclusion that ultimately a Jew ought not to be ethical, but instead\nreligious.\n",
