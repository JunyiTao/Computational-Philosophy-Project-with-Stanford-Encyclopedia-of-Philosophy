    "main_text": "Motor Component and Efferent Readiness Theories || .2 The Bold Readiness Theory\n4. Skill/Disposition Theories\n\nThe last approach we shall discuss has roots in, and similarities to,\nmany of the proposals covered above, but is most closely aligned with\nthe bold readiness theory. We will follow Grush (2007) in calling this\napproach the disposition theory (see Grush 2007: 394, for discussion\nof the name). The primary proponent of this position is Gareth Evans,\nwhose work on spatial representation focused on understanding how we\nmanage to perceive objects as occupying locations in egocentric space.\nRelated views have been defended by Peacocke 1992, chap. 3; Simmons\n2003; Schellenberg 2007, 2010; Briscoe 2009, 2014; Ward et al. 2011;\nAlsmith 2012; Mandrigin 2021; de Vignemont 2021; and Nave et al.\n2022.\n\nThe starting point of Evans\u2019 theory is that the subject\u2019s\nperceptual systems have isolated a channel of sensory input, an\n\u201cinformation link\u201d, through which she receives information\nabout the object. The information link by itself does not allow the\nsubject to know the location of this object. Rather, it is when the\ninformation link is able to induce in the subject appropriate kinds of\nbehavioral dispositions that it becomes imbued with spatial\nimport:\n\n\nThe subject hears the sound as coming from such-and-such a position,\nbut how is the position to be specified? Presumably in\negocentric terms (he hears the sound as up, or down, to the\nright or to the left, in front or behind). These terms specify the\nposition of the sound in relation to the observer\u2019s own body;\nand they derive their meaning in part from their complicated\nconnections with the subject\u2019s actions. (Evans 1982:\n155)\n\n\nThis is not a version of a motor theory (e.g., Poincar\u00e9 1907:\n71). The behavioral responses in question are not to be\nunderstood as raw patterns of motor activations, or even muscular\nsensations. Such a reduction would face challenges anyway, since for\nany location in egocentric space, there are an infinite number of\nkinematic configurations (movements) that would, for example, effect a\ngrasp to that location; and for any kinematic configuration, there are\nan infinite number of dynamic profiles (temporal patterns of muscular\nforce) that would yield that configuration. The behavioral responses\nin question are overt environmental behavior:\n\n\nIt may well be that the input-output connections can be finitely\nstated only if the output is described in explicitly spatial terms\n(e.g., \u2018extending the arm\u2019, \u2018walking forward two\nfeet\u2019, etc.). If this is so, it would rule out the reduction of\nthe egocentric spatial vocabulary to a muscular vocabulary. But such a\nreduction is certainly not needed for the point being urged here,\nwhich is that the spatial information embodied in auditory perception\nis specifiable only in a vocabulary whose terms derive their meaning\npartly from being linked with bodily actions. Even given an\nirreducibility, it would remain the case that possession of such\ninformation is directly manifestable in behaviour issuing from no\ncalculation; it is just that there would be indefinitely many ways in\nwhich the manifestation can occur. (Evans 1982: 156)\n\n\nAlso, on this proposal, all modalities are in the same boat. As such\nthe disposition theory is more ambitious than most of the theories\nalready discussed, which are limited to vision. Not only is there no\nreduction of perceptual spatial content to a \u201cmuscular\nvocabulary\u201d, there is also no reduction of the spatial content\nof some perceptual modalities to that of one or more others\u2014as\nthere was for Berkeley, who sought to reduce the spatial content of\nvision to that of touch, and whose program forced a distinction\nbetween two spaces, visual space and tangible space:\n\n\nThe spatial content of auditory and tactual-kinaesthetic perceptions\nmust be specified in the same terms\u2014egocentric terms. \u2026\nIt is a consequence of this that perceptions from both systems will be\nused to build up a unitary picture of the world. There is only one\negocentric space, because there is only one behavioural space. (Evans\n1982: 160)\n\n\nRelatedly, for Evans it is not even the case that spatial perceptual\ncontent, for all modalities, is being reduced to behavioral\ndispositions. Rather, perceptual inputs and behavioral outputs\njointly and holistically yield a single behavioral space:\n\n\nEgocentric spatial terms are the terms in which the content of our\nspatial experiences would be formulated, and those in which our\nimmediate behavioural plans would be expressed. This duality is no\ncoincidence: an egocentric space can exist only for an animal in which\na complex network of connections exists between perceptual input and\nbehavioural output. A perceptual input\u2014even if, in some loose\nsense, it encapsulates spatial information (because it belongs to a\nrange of inputs which vary systematically with some spatial\nfacts)\u2014cannot have a spatial significance for an organism except\nin so far as it has a place in such a complex network of input-output\nconnections. (Evans 1982: 154)\n\nEgocentric spatial terms and spatial descriptions of bodily movement\nwould, on this view, form a structure familiar to philosophers under\nthe title \u201cholistic\u201d. (Evans 1982: 156, fn. 26)\n\n\nThis last point and the associated quotes address a common\nmisconception of the disposition theory. It would be easy to read the\ntheory as providing a proposal of the following sort: A creature\ngets sensory information from a stimulus, and the problem is to\ndetermine where that stimulus is located in egocentric space; the\nsolution is that features of that sensory episode induce dispositions\nto behavior targeting some egocentric location. While this sort\nof thing is indeed a problem, it is relatively superficial. Any\ncreature facing this problem must already have the capacity\nto grasp egocentric spatial location contents, and the problem is\nwhich of these ready-at-hand contents it should assign to the\nstimulus. But the disposition theory is addressing a deeper question:\nin virtue of what does this creature have a capacity to grasp\negocentric spatial contents to begin with? The answer is that the\ncreature must have a rich set of interconnections between sensory\ninputs (and their attendant information links) and dispositions for\nbehavioral outputs.\n\nRick Grush (2000, 2007) has adopted Evans\u2019 theory, and attempted\nto clarify and expand upon it, particularly in three areas: first, the\ndistinction between the disposition theory and other approaches;\nsecond, the neural implementation of the disposition theory; and\nfinally the specific kinds of dispositions that are relevant for the\nissue of spatial experience.\n\nThe theory depends on behavioral dispositions. Grush (2007) argues\nthat there are two distinctions that need to be made: first, the\norganism might possess i) knowledge of what the consequences (bodily,\nenvironmental, or sensory) of a given action will be; or ii) knowledge\nof which motor commands will bring about a given desired end state (of\nthe body, environment, or sensory channels) (Grush 2007: 408). I might\nbe able to recognize that a series of moves someone shows me will\nforce my grandmaster opponent into checkmate (knowledge of the first\nsort, the consequences of a given set of actions), and yet not have\nbeen anywhere near the skill level to have come up with that series of\nmoves on my own (knowledge of the second sort, what actions will\nachieve a desired effect). Sensorimotor contingency theorists appeal\nto knowledge of the first sort\u2014though No\u00eb (2004: 90) flirts\nwith appealing to knowledge of the second sort to explain the\nperceptual grasp of P-shapes; to the extent he does, he is embracing a\ndisposition theoretic account of P-shapes. Disposition theorists, and\nbold readiness theorists\n (Section 3.2.2)\n appeal to knowledge of the second sort. These are the dispositions of\nthe disposition theory: given some goal, the organism is disposed to\nexecute certain actions.\n\nThis leads to the second distinction, between type-specifying\nand detail-specifying dispositions. Grush (2007: 393)\nmaintains that only the latter are directly relevant for spatial\nperception. A type-specifying disposition is a disposition to execute\nsome type of behavior with respect to an object or place. For\nexample, an organism might be disposed to grasp, bite, flee, or\nfoveate some object. This sort of disposition is not relevant to the\nspatial content of the experience on the disposition theory. Rather,\nwhat are relevant are detail-specifying dispositions: the specifics of\nhow I am disposed to act to execute any of these behavior types. When\nreaching to grab the cup to take a drink (type), do I move my hand\nlike so (straight ahead, say), or like such (off to the right)? When I\nwant to foveate or orient towards (behavior type) the ant crawling up\nthe wall, do a I move my head and eyes like this, or like\nthat?\n\nThis latter distinction allows the disposition theory to answer one of\nthe main objections to the bold readiness theory (described at the end\nof section\n 3.2.2)\n that there is no single special disposition connected to perceiving\nany given object. That is true of type-specifying dispositions, but\nnot of detail-specifying dispositions. Given the ant\u2019s location\nthere is indeed a very limited range of detail specifying dispositions\nthat will allow me to foveate it (though this might require\nconstraints on possible actions, such as minimum jerk or\nother such constraints).\n\nGrush (2007; 2009) has proposed a detailed implementation of the\ndisposition theory in terms of neural information processing. The\nproposal involves more mathematics than is appropriate here, and so a\nquick qualitative description will have to suffice (for more detail,\nsee Grush 2007; 2009). The basic idea is that relevant cortical areas\nlearn sets of basis functions which, to put it very roughly,\nencode equivalence classes of combinations of sensory and postural\nsignals (for discussion, see Pouget et al. 2002). For\nexample, many combinations of eye orientation and location of\nstimulation on the retina correspond to a visual stimulus that is\ndirectly in front of the head. Sorting such bodily postural\ninformation (not just eye orientation, but any postural information\nthat affects sensation, which is most) and sensory condition pairs\ninto useful equivalence classes is the first half of the job.\n\nWhat this does is encode incoming information in a way that renders it\nready to be of use in guiding behavior, since the equivalence classes\nare precisely those for which a given kind of motor program is\nappropriate. The next part corresponds to how this information, so\nrepresented, can be used to produce the details of such a motor\nprogram. For every type of action in a creature\u2019s\nbehavioral repertoire (grasp, approach, avoid, foveate, bite, etc.)\nits motor areas have a set of linear coefficients, easily implemented\nas a set of neural connection strengths, and when these are applied to\na set of basis function values, a detailed behavior is specified. For\nexample, when a creature senses an object O1, a\nset of basis function values B1 for that stimulus\nis produced. If the creature decides to execute overt action\nA1, then the B1 basis function\nvalues are multiplied by the coefficient corresponding to\nA1. The result is an instance of behavior type\nA1 executed with respect to object\nO1. If the creature had decide instead to execute\naction A2, with respect to O1,\nthe B1 basis function values would have been\nmultiplied by the A2 set of coefficients, and the\nresult would be a motor behavior executing A2 on\nobject O1.\n\nAccordingly, the disposition theory has a very different account of\nwhat is happening with sensory substitution devices than Susan Hurley\nand Alva No\u00eb (see\n Section 2.3.2\n above). On the disposition theory, what allows the user of such a\ndevice to have spatial experience is not the ability to anticipate how\nthe sensory input will change upon execution of movement as the\nsensorimotor contingency theory would have it. Rather, it is that the\nsubject\u2019s brain has learned to take these sensory inputs\ntogether with postural signals to produce sets of basis functions that\npoise the subject to act with respect to the object that is causing\nthe sensory signals (see Grush 2007: 406).\n\nOne objection to disposition theories is what Hurley has called\nThe Myth of the Giving:\n\n\nTo suppose that \u2026 the content of intentions can be taken as\nunproblematically primitive in explaining how the content of\nexperience is possible, is to succumb to the myth of the giving.\n(Hurley 1998: 241)\n\n\nThe idea behind this objection is that one is simply shifting the debt\nfrom one credit card to another when one takes as problematic the\nspatial content of perception, and then appeals to motor behavior as\nthe supplier of this content. For then, of course, the question will\nbe: Whence the spatial content of motor behavior?\n\nThe disposition theory, however, does not posit any such unilateral\nreduction (though Taylor\u2019s bold readiness theory arguably does,\nsee\n Section 3.2.2\n above). As discussed above, Evans explicitly claims that the\nbehavioral space is holistically determined by both behavior and\nperception. And on Grush\u2019s account spatial content is\nimplemented in the construction of basis function values, and these\nvalues coordinate transitions from perceptual input to\nbehavioral output. As such, they are highly analogous to inferences\nwhose conditions of application are given in sensory-plus-postural\nterms and whose consequences of application manifest in behavioral\nterms. The import of the states that represent these basis function\nvalues is no more narrowly motor than the meaning of a conditional can\nbe identified with its consequent (or its antecedent, for that matter)\nin isolation.\n\nAnother very common objection, one that is often leveled at many forms\nof motor theory, has to do with the fact that even paralyzed people,\nwith very few possibilities for action, seem capable in many cases of\nnormal spatial perception. Such objections would, at a minimum, place\nsignificant pressure on any views that explain perceptual content by\nappeal to actual behavior. It is also easy to see how even\nhypothetical behavior would be called into question in such cases,\nsince in many such cases behavior is not physically possible.\nGrush\u2019s theory (2007), right or wrong, has something specific to\nsay about this objection. Since spatial content is taken to be\nmanifested in the production of basis function values in the cortex,\nthe prediction is that any impairments manifesting farther down the\nchain, the brain stem or spinal cord, for example, need have no direct\neffect on spatial content. So long as the relevant brain areas have\nthe wherewithal to produce sets of basis function values suitable for\nconstructing a motor sequence (if multiplied by the\naction-type-specific coefficients), then the occasioning perceptual\nepisode will have spatial content.\n",
