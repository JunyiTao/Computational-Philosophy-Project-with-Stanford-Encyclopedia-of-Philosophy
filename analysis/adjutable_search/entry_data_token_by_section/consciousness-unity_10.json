    "main_text": "Unity Across Time\n5. Unity Across Time\n\nUnified consciousness at a given time (synchronic unity) has mainly\nbeen our topic so far. We now turn, more briefly, to unified\nconsciousness over time (diachronic unity). As was noted as long ago\nas Kant, unity across time is required even for such rudimentary\nmental operations as counting (1781: A103); indeed, unity across time\nis crucial for virtually all cognition of any complexity. Now,\nunification in consciousness might not be the only way to\nunite earlier cognitive states (earlier thoughts, earlier experiences)\nwith current ones but it is certainly a central way and the one best\nknown to us. \n",
