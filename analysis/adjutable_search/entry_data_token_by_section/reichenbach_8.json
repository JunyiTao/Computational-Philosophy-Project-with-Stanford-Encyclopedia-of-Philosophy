The professional essays\nwere variously addressed to audiences of philosophers or physicists.\nThey are interesting for our purposes chiefly because they state\nphilosophical positions that Reichenbach had previously rejected, or\nwould later come to reject, or because they offer interpretations of\nthe theories that are problematic. Notable in the last respect is\nReichenbach\u2019s view that general covariance is a substantive\nclaim of general relativity: the laws of physics have the same\n\u201cform\u201d in every coordinate system and frame of reference.\nReichenbach does not explain the idea of the \u201cform\u201d of a\nphysical law. \n\nWhile Kantian perspectives\u2014the a priori\n\u201cconstitution of the object\u201d\u2014still linger, the\n\u201cPhilosophical Significance of the Theory of Relativity\u201d,\npublished in French in 1922, signals a break with some of\nReichenbach\u2019s previous views (1922c). Perhaps influenced by\nEinstein\u2019s \u201cGeometry and Experience\u201d (1921)\nReichenbach no longer holds that, contrary to the conventionalist\nviews he attributes to Helmholtz and Poincar\u00e9, the theory of\nrelativity has established a geometry as part of physics to which\nthere can be no empirically adequate alternative. After introducing\nthe idea of a universal force affecting all objects no matter how\ninsulated, and noting that gravitation as usually conceived is such a\nforce, Reichenbach writes that: \u201cThe solution to the problem of\nspace is\u2026found only in this conception we call\nconventionalism\u2026which goes back to Helmholtz and\nPoincar\u00e9.\u201d (Reichenbach, 2006, p. 135). The idea that\nempirically indistinguishable hypotheses differ only\nverbally\u2014\u201cequivalent descriptions\u201d in\nReichenbach\u2019s terminology\u2014is already developed here. \n",
