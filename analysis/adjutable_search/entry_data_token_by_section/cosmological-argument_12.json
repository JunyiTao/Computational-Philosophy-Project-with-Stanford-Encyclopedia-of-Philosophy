    "main_text": "The Kal\u0101m Cosmological Argument || The Causal Principle and Quantum Physics\n7.1 The Causal Principle and Quantum Physics\n\nThe basis for the argument\u2019s first premise is the Causal\nPrinciple that undergirds many cosmological arguments. (Oderberg\n[2002: 308] is mistaken when he tries to establish the uniqueness of\nthe kal\u0101m argument by denying that the Causal Principle\nplays a role in kal\u0101m argument. It only does not play a\nrole in supporting a particular premise in the argument.) Defenders\nand critics alike suggest that basing the argument on the Principle of\nCausation rather than on the more general Principle of Sufficient\nReason is advantageous to the argument (Morriston 2000: 149). Craig\nholds that the first premise is intuitively obvious; no one, he says,\nseriously denies it (Craig, in Craig and Smith 1993: 57). Although at\ntimes Craig suggests that one might treat the principle as an\nempirical generalization based on our ordinary and scientific\nexperiences (which might not be strong enough for the argument to\nsucceed in a strong sense, although it might be supplemented by an\ninference to the best explanation argument that what best explains the\nsuccess of science is that reality operates according to the causal\nprinciple), ultimately, he argues, the truth of the Causal Principle\nrests \u201cupon the metaphysical intuition that something cannot\ncome out of nothing\u201d (Craig, in Craig and Smith 1993: 147).\n\u201cNo one sincerely believes that things, say, a horse or\nan Eskimo village, can just pop into being without a cause\u201d\n(Craig and Sinclair 2009: 182), and this includes the universe.\n\nThe Causal Principle has been the subject of extended criticism. (We\naddressed objections to the Causal Principle as subsumed under the PSR\nfrom a philosophical perspective earlier in\n 4.4.)\n Some critics deny that they share Craig\u2019s intuitions about the\nCausal Principle (Oppy 2002). Morriston (2000) argues that, for one\nthing, it does not seem to be an a priori truth, for not only\ndoes it lack \u201ca kind of \u2018luminosity\u2019 that makes it\nimpossible not to believe it, but closer inspection does not make it\nclearer that it is true\u201d (2000: 156\u201359). He points not\nonly to the presence of serious doubters (which he thinks he should\nnot be able to find were it truly an a priori truth), but\nalso to quantum phenomena, and thereby joins those who raise\nobjections to the Causal Principle based on quantum physics (Davies\n1984: 200). On the quantum level, the connection between cause and\neffect, if not entirely broken, is to some extent loosened. For\nexample, it appears that electrons can pass out of existence at one\npoint and come back into existence elsewhere. One can neither trace\ntheir intermediate existence nor determine what causes them to come\ninto existence at one point rather than another. Neither can one\nprecisely determine or predict where they will reappear; their\nsubsequent location is only statistically probable given what we know\nabout their antecedent states. Hence, as Smith argues, \n\n\nquantum-mechanical considerations show that the causal proposition is\nlimited in its application, if applicable at all, and consequently\nthat a probabilistic argument for a cause of the Big Bang cannot go\nthrough. (Smith, in Craig and Smith 1993: 121\u201323, 182)\n\n\nCraig responds that appeals to quantum phenomena do not affect the\nkal\u0101m argument. For one thing, quantum events are not\ncompletely devoid of causal conditions. Even if one grants that the\ncausal conditions are not jointly sufficient to determine the event,\nat least some necessary conditions are involved in the quantum event.\nHowever, when one considers the beginning of the universe, he notes,\nthere are no prior necessary causal conditions; simply nothing exists\n(Craig, in Craig and Smith 1993: 146; see Koons 1997: 203). Pruss\n(2006: 169) contends that in quantum phenomena causal indeterminacy is\ncompatible with the causal principle in that the causes\nindeterministically bring about the effect. Morriston is rightly\npuzzled by this reply, for, he asks, what \n\n\nmakes a cause out of a bunch of merely necessary\nconditions. Apparently not that they are jointly\nsufficient to produce the effect. (2000: 158) \n\n\nIf conditions are not jointly sufficient, is there reason to think\nthat premise 1 is true? More recently, Craig argues that \n\n\nnot all physicists agree that subatomic events are uncaused\u2026.\nIndeed, most of the available interpretations of the mathematical\nformulation of [Quantum Mechanics] are fully deterministic. (Craig and\nSinclair 2009: 183. Jean Bricmont 2017, chap. 5, argues that\nBohm\u2019s causally deterministic interpretation of quantum\nphenomena is superior to the nondeterministic interpretation.) \n\n\nFor another, Craig argues, a difference exists between predictability\nand causality. It is true that, given Heisenberg\u2019s principle of\nuncertainty, we cannot precisely predict individual subatomic events.\nWhat is debated is whether this inability to predict is due to the\nabsence of sufficient causal conditions, or whether it is merely a\nresult of the fact that any attempt to precisely measure these events\nalters their status. The very introduction of the observer into the\narena so affects what is observed that it gives the appearance that\neffects occur without sufficient or determining causes. However, we\nhave no way of knowing what is happening without introducing observers\ninto the situation and the changes they bring. In the above example,\nwe simply are unable to discern the intermediate states of the\nelectron\u2019s existence apart from introducing conditions of\nobservation. When Heisenberg\u2019s indeterminacy is understood \nas describing not simply the events themselves but these events\nrelative to our knowledge of the events, the Causal Principle still\nholds and can still be applied to the initial singularity, although we\ncannot expect to achieve any kind of determinate predictability about\nwhat occurs in specific cases on the sub-atomic level given the\ncause.\n\nAt the same time, it should be recognized that showing that\nindeterminacy is a real feature of the world at the quantum level\nwould have significant negative implications for the more general\nCausal Principle that underlies the deductive cosmological argument.\nThe more this indeterminacy has ontological significance, the weaker\nis the Causal Principle. This is particularly important for subatomic\nevents, which would characterize the beginning of the universe.\nHowever, if the indeterminacy has merely epistemic significance, it\nscarcely affects the Causal Principle. Quantum accounts allow for\nadditional speculation regarding origins and structures of universes.\nIn effect, whether Craig\u2019s response to the quantum objection\nsucceeds depends upon deeper issues, in particular, the epistemic and\nontological status of quantum indeterminacy, the nature of the Big\nBang as a quantum phenomenon, the nature and role of indeterminate\ncausation, and whether realist theories about quantum phenomena have\nserious traction. Quantum physics is murky, as evidenced by\nBell\u2019s gedanken experiments, as described by Mermin\n(1985).\n\nSupporting the Causal Principle, Andrew Loke (2017: chapter 5) offers\na Modus Tollens argument that he thinks is immune to the criticisms in\n4.4 and that responds to the suggestion that only the initial state of\nreality began to exist uncaused (Oppy 2015). Loke argues that (a) if\nx begins to exist without a causally antecedent condition, then\nother kinds of things that can begin to exist can do so without a\ncausally antecedent condition, because (b) there would be no causally\nantecedent condition that would make it the case that only x\n(rather than these other kinds of things) begins to exist, and (c) the\nproperties of x and the properties of other kinds of things\nthat differentiate between them would be had by them only when they\nhad already begun to exist. (b) and (c) jointly imply that there would\nbe no essential difference between x and other kinds of things\nwhere beginning to exist uncaused is concerned. However, (d) it is not\nthe case that other kinds of things that can begin to exist would also\nbegin to exist without a causally antecedent condition. Therefore, (e)\nit is not the case that x begins to exist without a causally\nantecedent condition. For the critic, the critical question concerns\nthe grounds on which (d) is true, since there is a significant\ndifference between quantum events and nonquantum events (see the\ndiscussion of Quantum Physics above).\n",
