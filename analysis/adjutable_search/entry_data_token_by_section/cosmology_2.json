    "main_text": "Cosmology\u2019s Standard Model || Observations\n1.2 Observations\n\nThere are two main ways in which cosmological observations support\nperturbed FLRW models. First, cosmologists use matter and radiation in\nthe universe to probe the background spacetime geometry and its\nevolution. The universe appears to be isotropic at sufficiently large\nscales, as indicated by background radiation (most notably the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation (CMB), discussed below) and discrete\nsources (e.g., galaxies). Isotropy observed along a single worldline\nis, however, not sufficient to establish the universe is well\ndescribed by an FLRW geometry. A further assumption that our worldline\nis not the only vantage point from which the universe appears\nisotropic, often called the Copernican principle, is needed. Granting\nthis principle, there are theorems establishing that observations of\nalmost isotropic background radiation implies that the spacetime\ngeometry is almost\n FLRW.[10]\n The principle itself cannot be established directly via observations\n(see\n \u00a72).\n Given that we live in an almost FLRW models, we need to determine its\nparameters such as the Hubble constant \\(H_0\\) and the deceleration\nparameter \\(q_0 \\coloneqq {-}\\ddot{R}/(RH_0^2)\\), which measures how\nthe rate of expansion is changing, and the normalized density\nparameters \\(\\Omega_m\\coloneqq \\rho_m/(3H_0^2)\\) for each matter or\nenergy density component \\(m\\). There are a variety of ways to\ndetermine the accuracy of the background evolution described by the\nFLRW models, which depends on these parameters. For this purpose,\ncosmologists seek effective standard candles and standard\nrulers\u2014objects with a known intrinsic luminosity and length,\nrespectively, which can then be used to measure the expansion history\nof the universe.\n\nThe second main avenue of testing focuses on the SM\u2019s account of\nstructure formation, which describes the evolution of small\nperturbations away from the background FLRW geometry in terms of a\nsmall number of parameters such as the tilt \\(n_s\\) and the scalar to\ntensor ratio \\(r\\). Observations from different epochs, such as\ntemperature anisotropies in the CMB and the matter power spectrum\nbased on galaxy surveys, can be used as independent constraints on\nthese parameters as well as on the background parameters (indeed such\nobservations turn out to give the best constraints on the background\nmodel parameters). These two routes to testing almost FLRW spacetime\ngeometry are closely linked because the background model provides the\ncontext for the evolution of perturbations under the dynamics\ndescribed by general relativity.\n\nThe remarkable success of perturbed FLRW models in describing the\nobserved universe has led many cosmologists to focus almost\nexclusively on them, yet there are drawbacks to such a myopic\napproach. For example, the observations at best establish that the\nobserved universe can be well-approximated by an almost FLRW model\nwithin some (large) domain. But they are not the only models that fit\nthe data: there are other cosmological models that mimic FLRW models\nin the relevant domain, yet differ dramatically elsewhere (and\nelsewhen). Specifically, on the one hand there are a class of\nspatially homogeneous and anisotropic models (Bianchi models) that\nexhibit \u201cintermediate isotropization\u201d: namely, they have\nphysical properties that are arbitrarily close to (isotropic) FLRW\nmodels over some time scale\n \\(T\\).[11]\n Agreement over the time interval \\(T\\) does not imply global\nagreement, however, as these models have large anisotropies at other\ntimes. Relying on the FLRW models in making extrapolations to the\nearly or late universe requires some justification for ignoring\nmodels, such as these Bianchi models, that mimic their behavior for a\nfinite time interval. On the other hand there are inhomogeneous\nspherically symmetric models that can reproduce exactly the background\nmodel observations (number counts versus redshifts and angular\ndiameter distance versus redshift, for example) with or without a\ncosmological constant (Mustapha et al. 1997). These can be excluded by\ndirect observations with good enough standard candles (Clarkson et al.\n2008) or by observations of structure formation features in such\nuniverses (Clarkson & Maartens 2010); but that exclusion cannot\ntake place unless one indeed examines such models and their\nobservational consequences.\n\nLack of knowledge of the full space of solutions to EFE makes it\ndifficult to assess the fragility of various inferences cosmologists\nmake based on perturbed FLRW models. A fragile inference depends on\nthe properties of the model holding exactly, contrasted with robust\ninferences that hold even if the models are good approximations (up to\nsome tolerable error) that will hold even if the model is perturbed.\nThe singularity theorems (Hawking & Ellis 1973), for example,\nestablish that the existence of an initial singularity is robust:\nrather than being features specific to the FLRW models, or other\nhighly symmetric models, singularities are generic in models\nsatisfying physically plausible assumptions. The status of various\nother inferences cosmologists make is less clear. For example, how\nsensitively does the observational case in favor of dark energy, which\ncontributes roughly 70% of the total energy density of the universe in\nthe SM, depend upon treating the universe as having almost-FLRW\nspacetime geometry? As mentioned above, recent work has pursued the\npossibility of accounting for the same observations based upon\nlarge-scale inhomogeneities or local back-reaction, without recourse\nto dark\n energy.[12]\n Studies along these lines are needed to evaluate the possibility that\nsubtle dynamical effects, absent in the FLRW models, provide\nalternative explanations of observed phenomena. The deduction also\ndepends on the assumption that the EFE hold at cosmological scales -\nwhich may not be true: maybe for example some form of scalar-tensor\ntheory should be used. More generally, an assessment of the\nreliability of a variety of cosmological inferences requires detailed\nstudy of a larger space of cosmological models.\n",
