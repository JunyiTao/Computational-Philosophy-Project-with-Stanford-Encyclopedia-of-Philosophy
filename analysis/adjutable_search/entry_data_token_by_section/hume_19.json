    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion\n8. Philosophy of Religion\n\nHume wrote forcefully and incisively on almost every central question\nin the philosophy of religion, contributing to ongoing debates about\nthe reliability of reports of miracles, the immateriality and\nimmortality of the soul, the morality of suicide, and the natural\nhistory of religion, among others. All his work excited heated\nreactions from his contemporaries, and his arguments still figure\ncentrally in discussions of these issues today.\n\nHume\u2019s greatest achievement in the philosophy of religion is the\nDialogues concerning Natural Religion, which is generally\nregarded as one of the most important and influential contributions to\nthis area of philosophy. While all Hume\u2019s books provoked\ncontroversy, the Dialogues were thought to be so inflammatory\nthat his friends persuaded him to withhold them from publication until\nafter his death.\n\nHume\u2019s philosophical project, and the method he developed to\nexecute it, dictates his strategy in all the debates he entered. In\nthe debates about causation and ethics, there is an initial\ncritical phase, where Hume assesses the arguments of his\npredecessors and contemporaries, followed by a constructive\nphase, where he develops his own position. In the natural\nreligion debate, however, the situation is very different.\nHume\u2019s critique of the central concepts of natural religion in\nthe critical phase shows that these concepts have no content,\nso there is nothing for the constructive phase of his\nargument to be about. Instead of resolving this debate, Hume\neffectively dissolves it.\n\nThe Dialogues are a sustained and penetrating critical\nexamination of a prominent argument from analogy for the existence and\nnature of God, the argument from design. The argument from design\nattempts to establish that the order we find in the universe is so\nlike the order we find in the products of human artifice that it too\nmust be the product of an intelligent designer.\n",
