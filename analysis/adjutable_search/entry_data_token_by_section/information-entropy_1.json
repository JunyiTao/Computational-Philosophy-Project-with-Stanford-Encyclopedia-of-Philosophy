    "main_text": "Maxwell, Szilard and Landauer || Szilard's engine\n1.2 Szilard's engine\n\n\nSmoluchowski also left the possibility open of an exception even to\na modified second law:\n\n\nAs far as we know today, there is no automatic,\npermanently effective perpetual motion machine, in spite of the\nmolecular fluctuations, but such a device might, perhaps, function\nregularly if it were appropriately operated by intelligent\nbeings.\n\n\nSzilard (1929) attempted to investigate this special case of\nintelligently operated devices by considering a box containing only a\nsingle molecule. He argued that in order to achieve the entropy\nreduction, the intelligent being must acquire knowledge of which\nfluctuation occurs and so must perform a measurement. The second law\nwould not be threatened provided there was a compensating cost to\nperforming this measurement, regardless of the character of the\nintelligent being.\n\n\n\n\nThe Szilard engine consists of a box, containing a single molecule, in\nthermal contact with a heat bath, and a partition. Thermal contact\ntransfers energy, through random fluctuations, back and forth between\nthe molecule and the heat bath. The molecule bounces randomly\nthroughout the box with this thermal energy.\n\n\nThe partition is capable of being inserted into the box, dividing it\ninto two separate volumes, and is also capable of sliding,\nfrictionlessly, along the box to the left or to the right. When the\npartition is inserted in the box, collisions with the molecule exert a\npressure on the partition. If the partition moves in the direction of\nthe pressure, it may be coupled to a pulley and the force used to lift\na weight. If the partition moves against the pressure, this requires\nthe coupled pulley to lower a weight, working against the pressure\nexerted by the molecule.\n\n\nIf the partition is inserted at the middle point, the molecule is\ncaught on one side or the other with equal probability. Now if it is known\nwhich side the molecule is on, it is possible to connect up the\npartition to a pulley and extract work. Based upon the ideal gas law,\nPV=NkT, for the case\nwhere\nN=1, it is a standard calculation to show that the maximum\nwork extracted as the partition moves to the side of the box\nis kT\u2009\u2009ln\u20092.  As the molecule\nis assumed to be in thermal contact with the heat bath at all times,\nthe kinetic energy of the molecule is maintained at\n(3/2)kT, and the work extracted is drawn from the\nheat bath. Once the partition reaches the side of the box, it can be\nremoved and the cycle has been completed. Heat has been extracted from\nthe heat bath and converted into work, with apparent certainty.  The\nprocess may be repeated indefinitely to continue the certain\nextraction of work. If this succeeds, Smoluchowski's modified second\nlaw appears to be violated.\n\n\nSzilard's analysis emphasised the necessity of knowing\nwhich side the molecule is on, for work to be extracted. Without this\nit would not be possible to know in which direction the partition needs\nto move. This connects the apparent second law violation to the state\nof a demon's knowledge. Szilard argued that the second law would be\nsaved if the acquisition of knowledge by the demon came with a\ncompensating entropy cost. Much of the succeeding literature is\nconcerned with whether, and how, this knowledge comes with the cost\nthat Szilard believed, or with whether such knowledge is, in fact,\nnecessary for the engine's operation.\n",
