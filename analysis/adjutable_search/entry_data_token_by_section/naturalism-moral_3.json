    "main_text": "Descriptivism and Reductivism || Reductivism\n2.2 Reductivism\n\nAnother view that is often closely associated with naturalism is\n\u201creductivism.\u201d The reductivist says that moral properties\nreduce to some other kind of property. Again, we might be interested\neither in Naturalism as Reductivism as an ambitious attempt to\ncharacterize moral naturalism, or just in reductivism as an\ninteresting view in its own right. Unfortunately, it is unclear what\nit means for one property to reduce to another. \u2018Reduce\u2019\nis a philosopher\u2019s term of art, but it is used in very different\nways by different philosophers. We\u2019re in for another muddle; but\nlet\u2019s try to clear things up a bit.\n\nWe should note at the outset that there is a paradigm example of a\nreductive view, which is used almost every time a metaethicist\ndiscussing reductivism needs a toy example to play with. That paradigm\nis the hedonic reduction: that goodness is pleasure and\ntherefore reduces to pleasure. This introduces a key\ndesideratum of any account of reduction: that it should count the\nhedonic reduction as a reductive view.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s begin with one of the clearest things written\nabout reduction. Here\u2019s Nicholas Sturgeon:\n\n\nNaturalism is in one clear sense a \u2018reductionist\u2019 doctrine\nof course, for it holds that moral facts are nothing but natural\nfacts. What I deny, however, is that from this metaphysical doctrine\nabout what sort of facts moral facts are, anything follows about the\npossibility of reduction in another sense (to which I shall henceforth\nconfine the term) more familiar from the philosophical literature:\nthat is, about whether moral expressions can be given reductive\ndefinitions in some distinctive nonmoral vocabulary, in which any\nplausible moral explanations could then be recast (Sturgeon 1988,\n239\u2013240).\n\n\nSturgeon here distinguishes two distinct senses of the term\n\u2018reduction.\u2019 One is linguistic. A term can be reduced to\nanother term just in case the first term can be defined in terms of\nthe second. In this sense, reductivism is just another name for\nanalytic naturalism. In later work, Sturgeon mentions the possibility\nof \u201csynthetic reductions\u201d (Sturgeon 2009), so I think\nit\u2019s more accurate to say that Sturgeon\u2019s reductivism is\nanother name for descriptivism. Note that the hedonic reduction is a\ndescriptivist view since it states that the descriptive term\n\u2018pleasure\u2019 refers to the moral property of goodness. So\nthe linguistic sense of \u2018reduction\u2019 as another name for\ndescriptivism satisfies our key desideratum.\n\nLet\u2019s pause for a second to clear up another perennial source of\nconfusion about how metaethical terminology is used. Sturgeon and the\nother Cornell realists (see Section 6) call themselves\n\u201cnon-reductive\u201d naturalists; but when they say this, they\naren\u2019t describing any distinctive metaphysical commitments of\ntheir view. They are simply rejecting descriptivism. Sturgeon, at\nleast, is perfectly clear about this in the above quote. There are\nmetaphysical doctrines associated with Cornell realism, of course,\n(again, see Section 6). But as the Cornell realists used that term,\n\u201cnon-reductive\u201d naturalism is just naturalism without\ndescriptivism, i.e. one-term naturalism.\n\nIf we understand \u2018reduction\u2019 in its linguistic sense,\nreductivism is synonymous with descriptivism, and so we have a\nredundant bit of terminology. That\u2019s a good reason to understand\nreductivism as a distinct, metaphysical doctrine. So: what is a\nmetaphysical reduction? We might look to general metaphysics for help\nhere. Unfortunately, metaphysicians use the term \u2018reduce\u2019\nin lots of different ways; there is no one standard account for us to\nborrow (Stoljar 2010, 161\u2013162; McPherson 2015). But perhaps we\ncan get a sense of the general idea. In recent years, there has been a\nproliferation of terms within metaphysics that all seem to be aimed at\ncapturing the same idea: we can say what something is composed of, or\nwhat it is grounded in, or what it reduces to, or what the real\ndefinition of a thing is, and all of those locutions seem to be aimed\nat capturing the same thought (Rosen 2015). All of these locutions are\nways of articulating what it is to be some thing by saying\nwhat it is made of (compare Schroeder 2005; Schroeder 2016).\nOne key idea here is that if A reduces to B, then A is less\nfundamental than B (Laskowski 2020). Let\u2019s call this the\nFundamentality Platitude.\n\nIf we understand reductivism as a metaphysical thesis about\nfundamentality, per the Fundamentality Platitude, we can make a\nplausible case for Naturalism as Reductivism. Any naturalist will say\nthat the fundamental entities are the sorts of objects and properties\nthat are the subject matter of fundamental physics: bosons and leptons\n(etc.) with their spin and mass (etc.). Goodness is not one of those\nfundamental physical properties; goodness is a higher-level property\nwhich is ultimately composed of fundamental physical properties, the\nsame as any other natural property. Naturalists are, in this way,\nmetaphysical reductivists. And because non-naturalists deny that moral\nproperties are natural, their account of the nature of moral\nproperties is not constrained by the physicist\u2019s account of\nfundamental properties. A non-naturalist might well say that some\nmoral properties are metaphysically fundamental. So naturalists say,\nwhereas non-naturalists may deny, that all moral properties reduce to\nnon-moral, physical properties. That\u2019s Naturalism as\nReductivism..\n\nHowever, there are problems with this argument. First, supernatural\nproperties cause trouble again. If moral properties are reducible to\nsupernatural properties, then reductivism is true and naturalism false\n(Sturgeon 2009). As before, we could try to finesse this by talking\nabout \u201creductive naturalism,\u201d the view that moral\nproperties reduce to natural properties, in particular. Many\nphilosophers do speak this way. But we can\u2019t characterize\nnaturalism as the view that moral properties reduce to natural\nproperties unless we already know what natural properties are. So talk\nof reductive naturalism means giving up on Naturalism as\nReductivism.\n\nSo let\u2019s set aside the more ambitious Naturalism as Reductivism\nand just focus on reductivism as a potentially interesting and\nimportant view in its own right. Unfortunately, there are problems\nwith giving a useful metaphysical characterization of reductivism.\nConsider the hedonic reduction: that goodness reduces to pleasure in\nvirtue of being identical to pleasure. Some philosophers defend the\nidea that pleasure is metaphysically fundamental. If we combine\npleasure fundamentalism with the hedonic reduction, we end up with the\nview that goodness is both reducible and fundamental (McPherson and\nPlunkett forthcoming). So depending on what we say about the\nmetaphysics of pleasure, the hedonic reduction may not be consistent\nwith the Fundamentality Platitude..\n\nThere\u2019s a larger problem lurking here. We\u2019ve characterized\ntwo different ideas as key to contemporary discussions of reduction in\nmetaethics: the Fundamentality Platitude and the hedonic reduction.\nThe hedonic reduction counts as a reductive view because of another\nplatitude about reduction: that identity entails reduction. Call that\nthe Identity Platitude. Here\u2019s Graham Oddie:\n\n\nExactly what is reduction? Take two kinds of entities, Type-A entities\nand Type-B entities. Although reduction is a contested notion, here is\nan undeniably sufficient condition for the reducibility of\ntype-A entities to type-B entities: every type-A entity is\nidentical to some type-B entity. (Oddie 2005, 15, italics in\noriginal)\n\n\nThe larger problem is that the Identity Platitude and the\nFundamentality Platitude are inconsistent. Identity is a symmetric\nrelation, but being-less-fundamental-than is an asymmetric relation,\nso nothing can satisfy both of those platitudes. If reduction is\nasymmetric, then reduction is not entailed by identity, and so the\nIdentity Platitude is false. If reduction is not asymmetric, then the\nfact that A reduces to B doesn\u2019t entail that A is less\nfundamental than B, and so the Fundamentality Platitude is false.\n\nHere\u2019s another way to demonstrate the point. Consider a close\ncousin of the hedonic reduction, the view that rightness is identical\nto conducing-to-pleasure. Conducing-to-pleasure is a complex property,\ncomposed of pleasure, conducing, and perhaps some abstract structural\nelements. On this view, rightness is identical to\nconducing-to-pleasure, and rightness is composed of and less\nfundamental than conducing and pleasure. So rightness stands in a\ndifferent relation to the complex conducing-to-pleasure than it does\nto the simpler elements. Which of those two relations is the reduction\nrelation? \u2018Reduction\u2019 is a term of art; it means whatever\nphilosophers mean by it. And, unfortunately, philosophers use the term\n\u2018reduction\u2019 to refer to both of those relations. So not\nonly is \u2018reduction\u2019 ambiguous between a linguistic and a\nmetaphysical concept, there\u2019s a further ambiguity in the\nmetaphysical use of the term.\n\nLet\u2019s sum up the discussion thus far. We were looking for an apt\ncharacterization of moral naturalism, and had a hard time finding one.\nWe then looked at two ways of characterizing naturalism in terms of\nother theses associated with naturalism: descriptivism and\nreductivism. We found that there are substantial problems with\ncharacterizing naturalism in terms of either descriptivism or\nreductivism, and that there are further problems with trying to\ncharacterize descriptivism and reductivism themselves. So while\nphilosophers frequently use the terms \u2018naturalism,\u2019\n\u2018descriptivism,\u2019 and \u2018reductivism\u2019 when\ndescribing various metaethical views, there\u2019s no way to define\nthose terms that isn\u2019t highly controversial. In light of this\ndepressing and distressing realization, there\u2019s only one thing\nto be done: ignore all of this and press on as though we know what\nwe\u2019re talking about when we use these terms. That is,\nunfortunately, what philosophers in this area tend to do. So even\nthough there\u2019s little agreement about what naturalism is,\nlet\u2019s see what philosophers have said about naturalism.\n",
