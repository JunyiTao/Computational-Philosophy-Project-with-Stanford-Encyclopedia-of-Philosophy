    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nWhen a person performs an act of euthanasia, she brings about the\ndeath of another person because she believes the latter\u2019s\npresent existence is so bad that he would be better off dead, or\nbelieves that unless she intervenes and ends his life, his life will\nvery soon become so bad that he would be better off dead. Accordingly,\nthe motive of the person who performs an act of euthanasia is to\nbenefit the one whose death is brought about. (This also holds for\nmany instances of physician-assisted suicide, but use of the latter\nterm is usually restricted to forms of assistance which stop short of\nthe physician \u2018bringing about the death\u2019 of the patient,\nfor example, those involving means that have to be activated by the\npatient.)\n\nIt is important to emphasize the motive of benefiting the person who\nis assisted to die because well-being is a key value in relation to\nthe morality of euthanasia (see Section 3 below). Nonetheless, the\ndefensibility of the contention that someone can be better off dead\nhas been the subject of extensive philosophical deliberation. Those\nwho claim that a person can be better off dead believe this to be true\nwhen the life that remains in prospect for that person has no positive\nvalue for her (a possibility which is discussed by e.g., Foot, 1977;\nMcMahan 2002; Bradley 2009), whereas some of those who hold that a\nperson\u2019s life is inviolable deny that a person can ever be\nbetter off dead (e.g., Keown in Jackson and Keown 2012). A\nKant-inspired variant on this latter position has been advanced by\nVelleman (1999). He considers that a person\u2019s well-being can\nonly matter if she is of intrinsic value and so that it is\nimpermissible to violate a person\u2019s rational nature (the source\nof her intrinsic value) for the sake of her well-being. Accordingly,\nhe holds that it is impermissible to assist someone to die who judges\nthat she would be better off dead and competently requests assistance\nwith dying. The only exception is when a person\u2019s life is so\ndegraded as to call into question her rational nature, albeit he\nthinks it unlikely that anyone in that position will remain competent\nto request assistance with dying. This position appears to be at odds\nwith the well-established right of a competent patient to refuse\nlife-prolonging medical treatment, at least when further treatment is\nrefused because she considers that her life no longer has value for\nher and further treatment will not restore its value to her. (For\nfurther reasons to reject arguments for the inviolability of the life\nof a person, including Velleman\u2019s, see e.g., McMahan 2002; Young\n2007; Sumner 2011.)\n\nBecause our concern will be with voluntary euthanasia \u2013\nthat is, with those instances of euthanasia in which a clearly\ncompetent person makes a voluntary and enduring request to be helped\nto die (or, by extension, when an authorised proxy makes a substituted\njudgment by choosing in the manner the no-longer-competent person\nwould have chosen had he remained competent) \u2013 a second key\nvalue is the competence of the person requesting assistance with\ndying. There will be occasion to mention non-voluntary\neuthanasia \u2013 instances of euthanasia where a person lacks\nthe competence at the time when a decision is to be made to request\neuthanasia and has not previously competently declared a preference\nfor it via an advance directive (see the entry on\n advance directives)\n \u2013 only when consideration is given to the claim that permitting\nvoluntary euthanasia will lead via a slippery slope to permitting\nnon-voluntary euthanasia. Nothing will be said here about\ninvoluntary euthanasia, where a competent person\u2019s life\nis brought to an end despite an explicit expression of opposition to\neuthanasia, beyond saying that, no matter how honorable the\nperpetrator\u2019s motive, such a death is, and ought to be,\nunlawful.\n\nDebate about the morality and legality of voluntary euthanasia has\nbeen, for the most part, a phenomenon of the second half of the\ntwentieth century and the beginning of the twenty first century.\nCertainly, the ancient Greeks and Romans did not believe that life\nneeded to be preserved at any cost and were, in consequence, tolerant\nof suicide when no relief could be offered to a dying person or, in\nthe case of the Stoics and Epicureans, when a person no longer cared\nfor his life. In the sixteenth century, Thomas More, in describing a\nutopian community, envisaged such a community as one that would\nfacilitate the death of those whose lives had become burdensome as a\nresult of \u2018torturing and lingering pain\u2019. But it has only\nbeen in the last hundred years that there have been concerted efforts\nto make legal provision for voluntary euthanasia. Until quite recently\nthere had been no success in obtaining such legal provision (though\nassisted suicide, including, but not limited to, physician-assisted\nsuicide, has been legally tolerated in Switzerland for a number of\ndecades). However, the outlook changed dramatically in the 1970s and\n80s because of a series of court cases in The Netherlands which\nculminated in an agreement between the legal and medical authorities\nto ensure that no physician would be prosecuted for assisting a\npatient to die as long as certain guidelines were strictly adhered to\n(see Griffiths, et al., 1998). In brief, the guidelines were\nestablished to permit physicians to practise voluntary euthanasia in\nthose instances in which a competent patient had made a voluntary and\ninformed request to be helped to die, the patient\u2019s suffering\nwas unbearable, there was no way of making that suffering bearable\nthat was acceptable to the patient, and the physician\u2019s\njudgements as to diagnosis and prognosis were confirmed after\nconsultation with another physician.\n\nThe first legislative approval for voluntary euthanasia was achieved\nwith the passage in the parliament of Australia\u2019s Northern\nTerritory of a bill enabling physicians to practise voluntary\neuthanasia. Subsequent to the Act\u2019s proclamation in 1996, it\nfaced a series of legal challenges from opponents of voluntary\neuthanasia. In 1997 the challenges culminated in the Australian\nNational Parliament overturning the legislation when it prohibited\nAustralian territories from enacting legislation to permit voluntary\neuthanasia on constitutional grounds. Australia is a federation\nconsisting of six states and two territories. Unlike the territories,\nthe states do have the constitutional right to enact such legislation\nand in 2017 the state of Victoria did just that. The legislation came\ninto effect in 2019. In 2019, a second state, Western Australia,\nenacted legislation to enable voluntary medically assisted death. The\nlegislation became effective in 2021. In 2021 three further states,\nTasmania, South Australia and Queensland enacted legislation to enable\nvoluntary medically assisted death which will come into force in 2022\nfor the first two, and 2023 for the third. In 2022 NSW enacted\nlegislation which will come into force in 2023 thereby ensuring that\nvoluntary medically assisted death will be available in each of the\nstates by the end of 2023. \n\nIn November 2000, The Netherlands passed legislation to legalize the\npractice of voluntary euthanasia. The legislation passed through all\nthe parliamentary stages early in 2001. The Belgian parliament passed\nsimilar legislation in 2002 and Luxembourg followed suit in 2009. (For\na very helpful comparative study of relevant legislation see Lewis\n2007. See also Griffiths, et al. 2008.)\n\nIn Oregon in the United States, legislation was introduced in 1997 to\npermit physician-assisted suicide after a referendum strongly endorsed\nthe proposed legislation. Later in 1997 the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States ruled that there is no constitutional right to\nphysician-assisted suicide; however, the Court did not preclude\nindividual states from legislating in favor of physician-assisted\nsuicide (so the Oregon legislation was unaffected). Since that time\nthe Oregon legislation has been successfully utilised by a significant\nnumber of people and similar legislation has been passed in the state\nof Washington in 2009, in Vermont in 2013, and more recently still in\nCalifornia, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico and the\nDistrict of Columbia. A series of judicial decisions in the state of\nMontana in 2008 and 2009 established that the state could not prohibit\nphysician-assisted suicide but legislation has not yet been introduced\nto codify the legal situation. A number of the remaining states are\ncurrently considering physician-assisted suicide bills.\n\nA similar legal position to that in Montana has obtained in the nation\nof Colombia since the late 1990s as a result of a majority ruling by\nits Constitutional Court in favor of the legality of\nphysician-assisted suicide. In 2021, Spain legalized voluntary\neuthanasia. In Austria and Germany courts have authorised\nphysician-assisted suicide but no legislative backing for the practice\nhas been introduced, while in Italy legislation for voluntary\nmedically assisted death has been passed in one house of the bicameral\nparliament and in Portugal there is legislation in place for\nphysician-assisted suicide which is currently under review for its\nconstitutionality. \n\nIn Canada, the province of Quebec introduced legislation permitting\nmedical aid in dying in 2014. The legislation came into effect in 2016\nat around the same time that the Canadian National Parliament passed\nlegislation permitting both physician-assisted suicide and voluntary\neuthanasia throughout all of the Canadian federation. (For a brief\naccount of events leading up to the enactment of the various pieces of\nlegislation in the United States and in Canada see Sumner 2017.)\n\nNew Zealand held a referendum in 2019 which resulted in approval for\nthe introduction of legislation for voluntary medically assisted\ndeath. The legislation comes into effect late in 2021.\n\nWith that brief sketch of the historical background in place, we will\nproceed first to consider the conditions that those who have advocated\nmaking voluntary medically assisted death legally permissible have\ntypically insisted should be satisfied. Consideration of the proposed\nconditions will establish a framework for the moral interrogation that\nwill follow in Sections 3 and 4. Section 3 will outline the positive\nmoral case put forward by those who want voluntary euthanasia and\nphysician-assisted suicide to be legally permissible. Section 4 will\nbe devoted to scrutinising the most important of the objections that\nhave been levelled against that case by those opposed to the\nlegalization of voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted\nsuicide.\n2. Five Conditions Often Proposed as Necessary for Candidacy for Voluntary Euthanasia\n\nAdvocates of voluntary euthanasia typically contend that if a\nperson\n\nis suffering from a terminal illness;\nis unlikely to benefit from the discovery of a cure for that\nillness during what remains of her life expectancy;\nis, as a direct result of the illness, either suffering\nintolerable pain, or only has available a life that is unacceptably\nburdensome (e.g., because the illness has to be treated in ways that\nlead to her being unacceptably dependent on others or on technological\nmeans of life support);\nhas an enduring, voluntary and competent wish to die (or has,\nprior to losing the competence to do so, expressed a wish to be\nassisted to die in the event that conditions (a)-(c) are satisfied);\nand\nis unable without assistance to end her life,\n\n\nthen there should be legal and medical provision to facilitate her\nbeing allowed to die or assisted to die.\n\nIt should be acknowledged that these conditions are quite restrictive,\nindeed more restrictive than many think appropriate. In particular,\nthe first condition restricts access to voluntary euthanasia to those\nwho are terminally ill. While that expression is not free of\nall ambiguity, for present purposes it can be agreed that it does not\ninclude those who are rendered quadriplegic as a result of accidents,\nor sufferers from motor neurone disease, or individuals who succumb to\nforms of dementia like Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, to say nothing of\nthose afflicted by \u2018existential suffering\u2019. Those who\nconsider that cases like these show the first condition to be too\nrestrictive (e.g., Varelius 2014) may, nonetheless, agree that\nincluding them as candidates for legalized voluntary euthanasia is\nlikely to make it far harder in many jurisdictions to gain sufficient\nsupport for legalization (and so to make it harder to help those\nterminally ill persons who wish to die). Even so, they believe that\nvoluntary euthanasia should be permitted for those who consider their\nlives no longer worth living, not just for for the terminally ill. The\nfifth condition further restricts access to voluntary euthanasia by\nexcluding those capable of ending their own lives, and so may be\nthought unduly restrictive by those who would wish to discourage\nterminally ill patients from attempting suicide. There will be yet\nothers who consider this condition to be too restrictive because\ncompetent patients can always refuse nutrition and hydration (see,\ne.g., Bernat, et al., 1993; Savulescu 2014). Though this is true, many\ncompetent dying persons still wish to have access to legalized\nmedically assisted death, rather than having to rely on refusing\nnutrition and hydration, so that they may retain control over the\ntiming of their deaths and avoid needlessly prolonging the process of\ndying.\n\nThe second condition is intended simply to reflect the fact that it is\nnormally possible to say when someone\u2019s health status is\nincurable. So-called \u2018miracle\u2019 cures may be proclaimed by\nsensationalist journalists, but progress toward medical breakthroughs\nis typically painstaking. If there are miracles wrought by God that\nwill be quite another matter entirely, but it is at least clear that\nnot everyone\u2019s death is thus to be staved off.\n\nThe third condition recognises what many who oppose the legalization\nof voluntary euthanasia do not, namely, that it is not only a desire\nto be released from pain that leads people to request help with dying.\nIn The Netherlands, for example, pain has been found to be a less\nsignificant reason for requesting assistance with dying than other\nforms of suffering like frustration over loss of independence (see\ne.g., Marquet, et al., 2003; Onwuteaka-Philipsen, et al., 2012;\nEmanuel, et al., 2016). Sufferers from some terminal conditions may\nhave their pain relieved but have to endure side effects that, for\nthem, make life unbearable. Others may not have to cope with pain but,\ninstead, with having to rely on forms of life support that\nsimultaneously rob their lives of quality (as with, e.g., motor\nneurone disease). Yet others struggle with psychological distress and\nvarious psychiatric conditions and believe these conditions ought to\nbe counted among the forms of suffering that qualify competent\nindividuals to access medical assistance with dying. There has been\ngreater recognition of, and support for, this position in The\nNetherlands and Belgium than elsewhere, probably because legislation\nin those jurisdictions makes the role of unbearable suffering central\nto the determination of the eligibility of competent individuals for\nmedical assistance with dying. Even so, inclusion of these forms of\nsuffering highlights legitimate issues to do with the competence of at\nleast some of those who suffer from them. (For a helpful recent study\nof the handling of requests for assistance with dying by psychiatric\npatients in The Netherlands see Kim, et al., 2016.)\n\nA final preliminary point is that the fourth condition requires that\nthe choice to die not only be uncoerced and competent but that it be\nenduring. The choice is one that will require time for reflection,\nand, almost certainly, discussion with others, so should not be\nsettled in a moment. Nonetheless, as with other decisions affecting\nmatters of importance, adults are presumed to choose voluntarily and\nto be competent unless the presence of defeating considerations can be\nestablished. (See the entry on\n decision-making capacity.)\n The burden of proof of establishing lack of voluntariness, or lack of\ncompetence, is on those who refuse to accept an adult person\u2019s\nchoice. There is no need to deny that this burden can sometimes be met\n(e.g., by pointing to the person\u2019s being in a state of clinical\ndepression). The claim is only that the onus falls on those who assert\nthat an adult\u2019s choice is not competent.\n\nClearly the five conditions set out above are likely to require some\nrefinement if complete agreement is to be reached but there is\nsufficient agreement for us to proceed without further ado to\nconsideration of the cases for and against legalization of voluntary\neuthanasia. (However, for a fuller discussion of issues concerning the\ndefinition of \u2018euthanasia\u2019 see, e.g., Beauchamp and\nDavidson 1979.)\n3. A Moral Case for Voluntary Euthanasia\n\nOne central ethical contention in support of voluntary euthanasia is\nthat respect for persons demands respect for their autonomous choices\nas long as those choices do not result in harm to others. Respect for\npeople\u2019s autonomous choices is directly connected with the\nrequirement for competence because autonomy presupposes competence\n(cf., Brock 1992). People have an interest in making important\ndecisions about their lives in accordance with their own conception of\nhow they want to live. In exercising autonomy, or self-determination,\nindividuals take responsibility for their lives; since dying is a part\nof life, choices about the manner of their dying and the timing of\ntheir death are, for many people, part of what is involved in taking\nresponsibility for their lives. Many are concerned about what the last\nphase of their lives will be like, not merely because of fears that\ntheir dying might involve them in great suffering, but also because of\nthe desire to retain their dignity, and as much control over their\nlives as possible, during this phase. A second contention in support\nof voluntary euthanasia was mentioned at the beginning of this entry,\nnamely the importance of promoting the well-being of persons. When\nsomeone is suffering intolerable pain or only has available a life\nthat is unacceptably burdensome (see the third condition above), and\nhe competently requests medical assistance with dying, his well-being\nmay best be promoted by affording him that assistance. When harnessed\ntogether, the value to individuals of making autonomous choices, and\nthe value to those individuals who make such choices of promoting\ntheir own well-being, provide the moral foundation for requests for\nvoluntary euthanasia. Each consideration is necessary for moral\njustification of the practice, but taken in isolation neither suffices\n(see, e.g., Young 2007, 2017; Sumner 2011, 2017).\n\nThe technological interventions of modern medicine have had the effect\nof stretching out the time it takes for many people to die. Sometimes\nthe added life this brings is an occasion for rejoicing; sometimes it\ndrags out the period of significant physical and intellectual decline\nthat a person undergoes with the result that life becomes no longer\nworth living. Many believe there is no single, objectively correct\nanswer as to when, if at all, a person\u2019s life becomes a burden\nand hence unwanted. If they are right, that simply points up the\nimportance of individuals being able to decide autonomously for\nthemselves whether their own lives retain sufficient quality and\ndignity to make life worth living. Others maintain that individuals\ncan be in error about whether their lives continue to be worth living\n(cf., Foot 1977). The conditions outlined above in Section 2 are\nintended by those who propose them to serve, among other purposes, to\nsafeguard against such error. But it is worth adding that in the event\nthat a person who considers that she satisfies those conditions is\njudged by her medical attendants to be in error about whether it would\nbe worth her continuing to live, the likely outcome is that those\nattendants will refuse to provide medical assistance with dying.\n(Evidence that will be mentioned below shows that this happens\nfrequently in jurisdictions in which medically assisted dying has been\nlegalized.) Unless a patient is able to be transferred to the care of\nother medical professionals who accept her assessment, she will have\nto rely on her own resources (e.g., by refusing nutrition and\nhydration). Even so, other things being equal, as long as a critically\nill person is competent, her own judgement of whether continued life\nis a benefit to her ought to carry the greatest weight in any\nend-of-life decision making regardless of whether she is in a severely\ncompromised and debilitated state. The idea that a competent\nindividual\u2019s autonomous judgment of the value to her of\ncontinued life should trump an assessment by others of her well-being\nshould not be thought surprising because precisely the same happens\nwhen a competent patient refuses life-prolonging treatment.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of argument, that it is agreed that we should\nrespect a person\u2019s competent request for medical assistance with\ndying (e.g., so as to enable her to achieve her autonomously chosen\ngoal of an easeful death). It might be thought that in such an\neventuality different moral concerns will be introduced from those\nthat arise in connection with competent refusals. After all, while\ncompetent patients are entitled to refuse any form of medical\ntreatment, they are not entitled to insist on the administration of\nforms of medical treatment that have no prospect of conferring a\nmedical benefit or are not being provided for reasons to do with\nscarcity of medical resources or affordability. While each of these\npoints is sound, it remains the case that medical personnel have a\nduty to relieve suffering when that is within their capacity.\nAccordingly, doctors who regard medical assistance with dying as an\nelement of appropriate medical care will consider it morally\npermissible to agree to a request for assistance with dying by a\ncompetent dying patient who wishes to avoid unnecessary suffering. The\nreason for claiming only that this is morally permissible rather than\nmorally obligatory will be explained in a subsequent paragraph. (For\nfurther reflections on the issue of responses to requests for medical\nassistance see, for instance, Dworkin in Frey, et al. 1998; Sumner\n2011; Young 2017.)\n\nNotwithstanding this response, as was seen earlier, at least some\nproponents of voluntary medically assisted dying wish to question why\nmedical assistance with dying should be restricted to those covered\nby, in particular, the first three conditions set out above in Section\n2. If people\u2019s competent requests for medically assisted death\nshould be respected why impose any restrictions at all on who may have\naccess to medically assisted death? Why, for example, should those\nsuffering from depression, or forms of dementia, not be eligible for\nmedically assisted dying? Most proponents of voluntary medically\nassisted dying hold that there are at least two reasons for\nrestricting access to it to those who satisfy the conditions set out\nearlier (or, a modified set that takes account of the concerns\ncanvassed in the discussion of those proposed conditions). First, they\ncontend that there are political grounds for doing so, namely, that\nbecause legalizing medically assisted dying for competent individuals\nis politically contested, the best hope for its legalization lies in\nfocusing on those forms of suffering most likely to effect law reform.\nThat is why some proponents deny the eligibility even of sufferers\nfrom conditions like \u2018locked-in\u2019 syndrome, motor neurone\ndisease, and multiple sclerosis for voluntary medically assisted dying\nsince, strictly, they are not terminally ill, and reliance has to be\nplaced in consequence on their claim to be suffering unbearably.\nSecond, and relatedly, most proponents of the legalization of medical\nassistance with dying have been cautious about supporting medically\nassisted death for those suffering from, for example, depression and\ndementia, because not only are they not terminally ill, but their\ncompetence to request assistance with dying is apt to be called into\nquestion, particularly in instances where they have given no prior\nindication of their preference for such assistance. Restricting access\nto medical assistance with dying to those whose suffering is less\nlikely to be disputed avoids becoming embroiled in controversy. Some\ncritics of the restrictive approach (e.g., Varelius 2014) take a\nharder line still and claim that it should not even be necessary for a\nperson to be suffering from a medical condition to be eligible for\nmedical assistance with dying; it should be enough to be \u2018tired\nof life\u2019. Only in a few jurisdictions, viz., Switzerland, The\nNetherlands and Belgium, has this issue been seriously broached.\nRegardless of what may happen in those jurisdictions, those seeking\nthe legal provision of medical assistance with dying in other\njurisdictions seem likely to maintain that if such assistance is to be\nseen as a legitimate form of medical care it has to be provided in\nresponse to a medical condition (rather than because someone is\n\u2018tired of life\u2019), and, indeed, restricted to those who\nsatisfy the conditions outlined earlier in Section 2 (or some similar\nset of conditions). In short, these latter hold that making an\nautonomous request for assistance with dying is necessary, but should\nnot be sufficient, for triggering such assistance.\n\nThere is one final matter of relevance to the moral case for voluntary\nmedically assisted death on which comment must be made. The comment\nconcerns a point foreshadowed in a previous paragraph, but it is also\nlinked with the remark just made about the insufficiency of an\nautonomous request for assistance with dying to trigger that\nassistance. It is important to make the point that respect has to be\nshown not only for the dying person\u2019s autonomy but also for the\nprofessional autonomy of any medical personnel asked to lend\nassistance with dying. The value (or, as some would prefer, the right)\nof self-determination does not entitle a patient to try to compel\nmedical professionals to act contrary to their own moral or\nprofessional values. Hence, if voluntary euthanasia is to be legally\npermitted, it must be against a backdrop of respect for professional\nautonomy. Similarly, if a doctor\u2019s view of her moral or\nprofessional responsibilities is at odds with her patient\u2019s\ncompetent request for euthanasia, she should make provision, where it\nis feasible to do so, for the transfer of the patient to the care of a\ndoctor who faces no such conflict. Given that, to date, those who\ncontend that no scope should be permitted for conscientious objection\nwithin medical practice have garnered very little support for that\nview, making use of referrals and transfers remains the most effective\nmeans of resolving such disagreements.\n\nOpponents of voluntary euthanasia have endeavored in a variety of ways\nto counter the very straightforward moral case that has been laid out\nabove for its legalization (see, for example, Keown 2002; Foley, et\nal. 2002; Biggar 2004; Gorsuch 2006). Some of the counter-arguments\nare concerned only with whether the moral case warrants making the\npractice of voluntary euthanasia legal, whereas others are concerned\nwith trying to undermine the moral case itself. In what follows,\nconsideration will be given to the five most important\ncounter-arguments. (For more comprehensive discussions of the morality\nand legality of medically assisted death see Keown 2002; Biggar 2004;\nGorsuch 2006; Young 2007; Sumner 2011.)\n4. Five Objections to the Moral Permissibility of Voluntary Euthanasia\n4.1 Objection 1\n\nIt is sometimes said (e.g., Emanuel 1999; Keown in Jackson and Keown\n2012) that it is not necessary nowadays for people to die while\nsuffering from intolerable or overwhelming pain because the provision\nof effective palliative care has improved steadily, and hospice care\nis more widely available. Some have urged, in consequence, that\nvoluntary euthanasia is unnecessary.\n\nThere are several flaws in this contention. First, while both good\npalliative care and hospice care make important contributions to the\ncare of the dying, neither is a panacea. To get the best palliative\ncare for an individual involves trial and error, with some consequent\nsuffering in the process; moreover, even the best care fails to\nrelieve all pain and suffering. Perhaps even more importantly, high\nquality palliative care commonly exacts a price in the form of\nside-effects such as nausea, incontinence, loss of awareness because\nof semi-permanent drowsiness, and so on. A rosy picture is often\npainted as to how palliative care can transform the plight of the\ndying. Such a picture is misleading according to those who have\nclosely observed the effect of extended courses of treatment with\ndrugs like morphine. For these reasons many skilled palliative care\nspecialists acknowledge that palliative care does not enable an\neaseful death for every patient. Second, even though the sort of care\nprovided through hospices is to be applauded, it is care that is\navailable to only a small proportion of the terminally ill and then\nusually only in the very last stages of the illness (typically a\nmatter of a few weeks). Notwithstanding that only relatively few of\nthe dying have access to hospice care it is worth drawing attention to\nthe fact that in, Oregon, to cite one example, a high proportion of\nthose who have sought physician-assisted suicide were in hospice care.\nThird, and of greatest significance for present purposes, not everyone\nwishes to avail themselves of palliative or hospice care. For those\nwho prefer to die on their own terms and in their own time, neither\noption may be attractive. As previously mentioned, a major source of\ndistress for many dying patients is the frustration that comes with\nbeing unable to satisfy their autonomous wishes. Fourth, as also\nindicated earlier, the suffering that occasions a desire to end life\nis not always traceable to pain caused by illness. For some, what is\nintolerable is their forced dependence on others or on life-supporting\nmachinery; for these patients, the availability of effective pain\ncontrol is not the primary concern. (In relation to the preceding\nmatters see Rietjens, et al., 2009 and Onwuteaka-Philipsen et al. 2012\nfor findings for The Netherlands; and, for Oregon, Ganzini, et al.\n2009.)\n4.2 Objection 2\n\nA second, related objection to the moral and legal permissibility of\nvoluntary euthanasia turns on the claim that we can never have\nsufficient evidence to be justified in believing that a dying\nperson\u2019s request to be helped to die is competent, enduring and\ngenuinely voluntary.\n\nIt is certainly true that a request to die may not reflect an enduring\ndesire to die (just as some attempts to commit suicide may reflect\nonly temporary despair). That is why advocates of the legalization of\nvoluntary euthanasia have argued that a cooling off period should\nnormally be required before euthanasia is permitted to ensure that the\nrequest is enduring. That having been said, to claim that we can never\nbe justified in believing that someone\u2019s request to die reflects\na settled preference for death is to go too far. If a competent person\ndiscusses the issue with others on different occasions over time, and\nremains steady in her resolve, or privately reflects on the issue for\nan extended period and does not waver in her conviction, her wish to\ndie surely must be counted as enduring.\n\nBut, it might be asked, what if a person is racked with pain, or\nmentally confused because of the measures taken to relieve her pain,\nand is, in consequence, unable to think clearly and rationally about\nthe alternatives? It has to be agreed that a person in those\ncircumstances who wants to die should not be assumed to have a truly\nvoluntary and enduring desire to die. However, there are at least two\nimportant points to make about those in such circumstances. First,\nthey do not account for all of the terminally ill, so even if it is\nacknowledged that such people are incapable of agreeing to voluntary\neuthanasia that does not show that no one can ever voluntarily request\nhelp to die. Second, it is possible in at least some jurisdictions for\na person to indicate, in advance of losing the capacity to give\ncompetent consent, how she would wish to be treated should she become\nterminally ill and suffer either intolerable pain or an unacceptable\nloss of control over her life (cf., for instance, Dworkin 1993).\n\u2018Living wills\u2019 or \u2018advance directives\u2019 are\nlegal instruments for giving voice to people\u2019s wishes while they\nare capable of giving competent, enduring and voluntary consent,\nincluding to their wanting help to die. As long as they are easily\nrevocable in the event of a change of mind (just as civil wills are),\nthey should be respected as evidence of a well thought-out conviction.\n(For more detailed consideration of these instruments see the entry on\n advance directives.)\n\nPerhaps, though, what is really at issue in this objection is whether\nanyone can ever form a competent, enduring and voluntary\njudgement about being better off dead, rather than continuing to\nsuffer from an illness, prior to suffering such an illness\n(cf., Keown in Jackson and Keown 2012). If this is what underlies the\nobjection it is surely too paternalistic to be acceptable. Why is it\nnot possible for a person to have sufficient inductive evidence (e.g.,\nbased on the experience of the deaths of friends or family) to know\nher own mind, and act accordingly, without having had direct\nexperience of such suffering?\n4.3 Objection 3\n\nAccording to the traditional interpretation of the \u2018doctrine of\ndouble effect\u2019 it is permissible to act in a way which it is\nforeseen will have a bad effect, provided only that\n\nthe bad effect occurs as a side-effect (i.e., indirectly) to the\nachievement of the act that is directly aimed at;\nthe act directly aimed at is itself morally good or, at least,\nmorally neutral;\nthe good effect is not achieved by way of the bad, that is, the\nbad must not be a means to the good; and\nthe bad effect must not be so serious as to outweigh the good\neffect.\n\n\nHence, it is permissible, according to the doctrine of double effect,\nto, for example, alleviate pain (a good effect) by administering a\ndrug such as morphine, knowing that doing so will shorten life, but\nimpermissible to administer the same drug with the direct intention of\nterminating a patient\u2019s life (a bad effect). This latter claim\nis said to apply regardless of whether the drug is given at the\nperson\u2019s request.\n\nThis is not the appropriate forum for a full consideration of the\ndoctrine, for which see the entry on the\n doctrine of double effect.\n However, there is one very important criticism to be made of the\napplication of the doctrine that has direct relevance to the issue of\nvoluntary euthanasia.\n\nOn the most plausible reading, the doctrine of double effect can be\nrelevant to the permissibility of voluntary euthanasia only when a\nperson\u2019s death is bad for her or, to put it another way, a\nharm to her. Sometimes the notion of \u2018harm\u2019 is\nunderstood simply as damage to a person\u2019s interests whether\nconsented to or not. At other times, it is understood, more strictly,\nas damage that has been wrongfully inflicted. On either understanding\nof harm, there can be instances in which death for a person does not\nconstitute a harm for her because it will either render her better\noff, or, as some would insist, no worse off, when compared with\nremaining alive. Accordingly, in those instances, the doctrine of\ndouble effect can have no relevance to the debate about the\npermissibility of voluntary euthanasia. (For extended discussions of\nthe doctrine of double effect and its bearing on the moral\npermissibility of voluntary euthanasia see, e.g., McIntyre 2001;\nWoodward 2001; Cavanaugh 2006; Young 2007; Sumner 2011.)\n4.4 Objection 4\n\nAs was noted earlier in Section 3, there is a widespread belief\nconcerning the moral acceptability of so-called passive (voluntary)\neuthanasia, wherein life-sustaining or life-prolonging measures are\nwithdrawn or withheld in response to a competent patient\u2019s\nrequest. The reason why passive (voluntary) euthanasia is said to be\nmorally permissible is that the patient is simply allowed to die\nbecause steps are not taken to preserve or prolong life. This happens,\nfor example, when a dying patient requests the withdrawal or the\nwithholding of measures whose administration would be medically\nfutile, or unacceptably burdensome. By contrast, active (voluntary)\neuthanasia is said to be morally impermissible because it is claimed\nto require an unjustifiable intentional act of killing to satisfy the\npatient\u2019s request (cf., for example, Finnis, 1995; Keown in\nJackson and Keown 2012).\n\nDespite its popularity and widespread use, the distinction between\npassive and active euthanasia is neither particularly clear nor\nmorally helpful. (For a fuller discussion, see McMahan 2002.) Whether\nbehavior is described in terms of acts or omissions (a distinction\nwhich underpins the alleged difference between active and passive\nvoluntary euthanasia and that between killing a person and letting her\ndie), is often a matter of pragmatics rather than anything of deeper\nmoral importance. Consider, for instance, the practice (once common in\nhospitals) of deliberately proceeding slowly to a ward in response to\na request to provide assistance for a patient who has been assigned a\n\u2018not for resuscitation\u2019 code. Or, consider \u2018pulling\nthe plug\u2019 on a respirator keeping an otherwise dying patient\nalive, as against not replacing the oxygen supply when it runs out.\nAre these acts or omissions? If the answers turn on merely pragmatic\nconsiderations the supposed distinction between passive euthanasia and\nactive euthanasia will be hard to sustain.\n\nEven supposing that the distinction between acts and omissions, and\nthe associated distinction between killing and letting die, can be\nsatisfactorily clarified (on which see the entry\n doing v. allowing harm),\n there remains the issue of whether these distinctions have moral\nsignificance in any particular circumstance. Consider a case of a\npatient suffering from motor neurone disease who is completely\nrespirator dependent, finds her condition intolerable, and competently\nand persistently requests to be removed from the respirator so that\nshe may die. Even the Catholic Church in recent times has been\nprepared to agree that it is permissible, in a case like this, to turn\noff the respirator. No doubt this has been because the Catholic Church\nconsiders such a patient is only being allowed to die. Even were it to\nbe agreed, for the sake of argument, that such a death should be\nregarded as an instance of letting die, this concession would not show\nthat it would have been morally worse had the patient been killed at\nher request (active voluntary euthanasia) rather than being allowed to\ndie (passive voluntary euthanasia). Indeed, supporters of voluntary\nmedically assisted death maintain that since death is beneficial in\nsuch an instance (or, at the very least, leaves the dying person no\nworse off), actively bringing about the death is morally to be\npreferred to just allowing it to happen because the desired benefit is\nachieved sooner.\n\nOpponents of voluntary euthanasia claim, however, that the difference\nbetween active and passive euthanasia is to be found in the\nagent\u2019s intention: if someone\u2019s life is\nintentionally terminated she has been killed, whereas if she\nis just no longer being aggressively treated, her death should be\nattributed to the underlying disease. Many physicians would say that\ntheir intention in withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining medical\ntreatment in such circumstances is simply to respect the\npatient\u2019s wishes. This is plausible in those instances where the\npatient competently requests that aggressive treatment no longer be\ngiven (or, the patient\u2019s proxy makes such a request). But it\nwill often be implausible. In many cases the most plausible\ninterpretation of a physician\u2019s intention in withholding or\nwithdrawing life-sustaining measures is that it is to end the\npatient\u2019s life. Consider the palliative care practice of\n\u2018terminally sedating\u2019 a patient after a decision has been\nmade to cease aggressive treatment. Suppose (as sometimes happens)\nthat this is then followed by withholding artificially supplied\nnutrition. In these latter instances the best explanation of the\nphysician\u2019s behavior is that the physician intends thereby to\nend the life of the patient. What could be the point of the action,\nthe goal aimed at, the intended outcome, if not to end the\npatient\u2019s life? (Cf. Winkler 1995.) No sense can be made of the\naction as being intended to palliate the patient\u2019s diseased\ncondition, or to keep the patient comfortable. Nor is it appropriate\nto claim that what kills the patient is the underlying disease. What\nkills the patient is the act of depriving her of nutrition (i.e., of\nstarving her to death). The point can be generalized to cover many\nmore instances involving either the withdrawal or the withholding of\nlife-sustaining medical treatment. In short, there is no good reason\nto think that whereas so-called passive voluntary euthanasia is\nmorally acceptable active voluntary euthanasia never can be.\n\nBut we can go further. Giving titrated doses of morphine that reach\nlevels beyond those needed to control pain, or removing a respirator\nfrom a sufferer from motor neurone disease, seem to many of us to\namount to intentionally bringing about the death of the person being\ncared for. To be sure, as was acknowledged above, there are\ncircumstances in which doctors can truthfully say that the actions\nthey perform, or omissions they make, will bring about the deaths of\ntheir patients even though it was not their intention that those\npatients would die. So, for instance, if a patient refuses\nlife-prolonging medical treatment because she considers it futile, it\ncan be reasonable to say that her doctor\u2019s intention in\ncomplying with the request was simply to respect her wishes.\nNevertheless, as we have seen, there are other circumstances in which\nit is highly stilted to claim, as some doctors continue to do, that\nthey had no intention of bringing about death.\n\nThese considerations should settle matters but do not do so for those\nwho maintain that killing, in medical contexts, is always morally\nunjustified \u2013 a premise that underwrites much of the debate\nsurrounding this fourth objection. But this underlying assumption is\nopen to challenge and has been challenged by, for instance, Rachels\n1986 and McMahan 2002. One of the reasons the challengers have given\nis that there are cases in which killing a competent dying person when\nshe requests assistance with dying, is morally preferable to allowing\nher to die, namely, when taking the latter option would serve only to\nprolong her suffering against her wishes. Further, despite the\nlongstanding legal doctrine that no one can justifiably consent to be\nkilled (on which more later), it surely is relevant to the\njustification of an act of killing that the person killed has\nautonomously decided that she would be better off dead and so asks to\nbe helped to die.\n4.5 Objection 5\n\nIt is sometimes said that if society allows voluntary\neuthanasia to be legalized, we will then have set foot on a slippery\nslope that will lead us eventually to support other forms of\neuthanasia, including, in particular, non-voluntary euthanasia.\nWhereas it was once the common refrain that that was precisely what\nhappened in Hitler\u2019s Germany, in recent decades the tendency has\nbeen to claim that experience with legalized euthanasia in The\nNetherlands and Belgium, in particular, has confirmed the reality of\nthe slippery slope.\n\nSlippery slope arguments come in various versions. One (but not the\nonly) way of classifying them has been to refer to logical,\npsychological and arbitrary line versions. The common feature of the\ndifferent forms is the contention that once the first step is taken on\na slippery slope the subsequent steps follow inexorably, whether for\nlogical reasons, psychological reasons, or to avoid arbitrariness in\n\u2018drawing a line\u2019 between a person\u2019s actions. (For\nfurther discussion see, e.g., Rachels 1986; Brock 1992; Walton\n1992.)\n\nWe need first to consider whether, at the theoretical level, any of\nthese forms of argument is powerful enough to refute the case for the\nlegalization of voluntary euthanasia. We will then be in a position to\ncomment on the alleged empirical support from the experiences of\nHitler\u2019s Germany and, more recently, of legalized euthanasia in\nThe Netherlands and elsewhere, for the existence of a slippery slope\nthat will supposedly come into being with the legalization of\nvoluntary euthanasia.\n\nTo begin with, there is nothing logically inconsistent in supporting\nvoluntary euthanasia while maintaining the moral inappropriateness of\nnon-voluntary euthanasia. Undoubtedly, some advocates of voluntary\neuthanasia wish also to lend their support to some acts of\nnon-voluntary euthanasia, for example, for those in persistent\nvegetative states who have never indicated their wishes about being\nhelped to die, or for certain severely disabled infants for whom the\noutlook is hopeless. (See, e.g., Kuhse and Singer 1985; Singer 1994;\nStingl 2010; Sumner 2017.) Others believe that the consent of the\npatient is strictly required if euthanasia is appropriately to be\nlegalized. The difference is not a matter of logical acumen; it is to\nbe explained by reference to the importance placed on key values by\nthe respective supporters. Thus, for example, those who insist on the\nnecessity for a competent patient request for medical assistance with\ndying typically believe that such a request is the paramount\nconsideration in end-of-life decision making (even when it is\nharnessed to the value of individual well-being), whereas those who\nconsider a person\u2019s best interests to be the paramount\nconsideration are more likely to believe in the justifiability of\ninstances of non-voluntary euthanasia like those mentioned above.\n\nNext, it is hard to see why moving from voluntary to non-voluntary\neuthanasia is supposed to be psychologically inevitable. Why should\nthose who support the legalization of voluntary euthanasia, because\nthey value the autonomy of the individual, find it psychologically\neasier, in consequence, to endorse the killing of those who are not\nable competently to request assistance with dying? What reason is\nthere to believe that they will, as a result of their support for\nvoluntary euthanasia, be psychologically driven to endorse a practice\nof non-voluntary euthanasia?\n\nFinally, since there is nothing arbitrary about distinguishing\nvoluntary euthanasia from non-voluntary euthanasia (because the line\nbetween them is based on clear principles), there can be no substance\nto the charge that only by arbitrarily drawing a line between them\ncould non-voluntary euthanasia be avoided were voluntary euthanasia to\nbe legalized.\n\nWhat, though, of Hitler\u2019s Germany and the recent experience of\nlegalized voluntary euthanasia in The Netherlands and elsewhere? The\nformer is easily dismissed as an indication of an inevitable descent\nfrom voluntary euthanasia to non-voluntary. There never was a policy\nin favor of, or a legal practice of, voluntary euthanasia in Germany\nin the 1920s to the 1940s (see, for example, Burleigh 1994). There\nwas, prior to Hitler coming to power, a clear practice of killing some\ndisabled persons. But it was never suggested that their being killed\nwas justified by reference to their best interests; rather,\nit was said that society would be benefited. Hitler\u2019s later\nrevival of the practice and its widening to take in other groups such\nas Jews and gypsies was part of a program of eugenics, not\neuthanasia.\n\nSince the publication of the Remmelink Report in 1991 into the medical\npractice of euthanasia in The Netherlands, it has frequently been said\nthat the Dutch experience shows that legally protecting voluntary\neuthanasia is impossible without also affording shelter to the\nnon-voluntary euthanasia that will follow in its train (see, e.g.,\nKeown 2002). In the period since that report there have been a further\nfour national studies of the practice of euthanasia in The\nNetherlands. These studies were carried out in 1995, 2001, 2005 and\n2010 respectively (see, e.g., Rietjens, et al. 2009;\nOnwuteaka-Philipsen, et al. 2012). The findings from these national\nstudies have consistently shown that there is no evidence for the\nexistence of such a slippery slope. Among the specific findings the\nfollowing are worth mentioning: of those terminally ill persons who\nhave been assisted to die about sixty per cent have clearly been cases\nof voluntary euthanasia as it has been characterised in this entry; of\nthe remainder, the vast majority of cases were of patients who at the\ntime of their medically assisted deaths were no longer competent. It\nmight be thought that these deaths ought to be regarded as instances\nof non-voluntary euthanasia. But, in fact, it would be inappropriate\nto regard them as such. Here is why. For the overwhelming majority of\nthese cases, the decisions to end life were taken only after\nconsultation between the attending doctor(s) and close family members,\nand so can legitimately be thought of as involving substituted\njudgements. Moreover, according to the researchers, the overwhelming\nmajority of these cases fit within either of two common practices that\noccur in countries where voluntary euthanasia has not been legalized,\nnamely, that of terminal sedation of dying patients, and that of\ngiving large doses of opioids to relieve pain while foreseeing that\nthis will also end life. In a very few cases, there was no\nconsultation with relatives, though in those cases there were\nconsultations with other medical personnel. The researchers contend\nthat these instances are best explained by the fact that families in\nThe Netherlands strictly have no final legal authority to act as\nsurrogate decision-makers for incompetent persons. For these reasons\nthe researchers maintain that non-voluntary euthanasia is not widely\npractised in The Netherlands.\n\nThat there have only been a handful of prosecutions of Dutch doctors\nfor failing to follow agreed procedures (Griffiths, et al., 1998),\nthat none of the doctors prosecuted has had a significant penalty\nimposed, that a significant proportion of requests for medical\nassistance with dying are rejected as unjustifiable, and that the\nDutch public have regularly reaffirmed their support for the agreed\nprocedures suggests that, contrary to the claims of some critics, the\nlegalization of voluntary euthanasia has not increased the incidence\nof non-voluntary euthanasia. A similar picture to the one in The\nNetherlands has emerged from studies of the operation of the law\nconcerning physician-assisted suicide in Oregon. Indeed, in a recent\nwide-ranging study of attitudes and practices of voluntary euthanasia\nand physician-assisted suicide covering two continents, a prominent\ncritic of these practices has concluded (in agreement with his\nco-authors) that little evidence exists of abuse, particularly of the\nvulnerable (see Emanuel, et al., 2016). Unfortunately, insufficient\ntime has elapsed for appropriate studies to be conducted in the other\njurisdictions that have legalized either voluntary euthanasia or\nphysician-assisted suicide. Finally, some commentators have pointed\nout that there may, in reality, be more danger of the line between\nvoluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia being blurred if euthanasia is\npractised in the absence of legal recognition, since there will, in\nthose circumstances, be neither transparency nor monitoring (which\ncannot be said of The Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon and so on).\n\nNone of this is to suggest that it is not necessary to ensure the\npresence of safeguards against potential abuse of legally protected\nvoluntary euthanasia. This is particularly important for the\nprotection of those who have become incompetent by the time decisions\nneed to be taken about whether to assist them to die. Furthermore, it\nis, of course, possible that the reform of any law may have unintended\neffects. However, if the arguments outlined above are sound (and the\nexperience in the The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, along with\nthe more limited experience in several states in the United States,\nis, for the present, not only the best evidence we have that they are\nsound, but the only relevant evidence), that does not seem\nvery likely.\n\nIt is now well-established in many jurisdictions that competent\npatients are entitled to make their own decisions about\nlife-sustaining medical treatment. That is why they can refuse such\ntreatment even when doing so is tantamount to deciding to end their\nlife. It is plausible to think that the fundamental basis of the right\nto decide about life-sustaining treatment \u2013 respect for a\nperson\u2019s autonomy and her assessment of what will best serve her\nwell-being \u2013 has direct relevance to the legalization of\nvoluntary euthanasia (see, e.g., Dworkin in Frey et al., 1998; Young\n2007, 2017; Sumner 2011). In consequence, extending the right of\nself-determination to cover cases of voluntary euthanasia does not\nrequire a dramatic shift in legal policy. Nor do any novel legal\nvalues or principles need to be invoked. Indeed, the fact that suicide\nand attempted suicide are no longer criminal offences in many\njurisdictions indicates that the central importance of individual\nself-determination in a closely analogous context has been accepted.\nThe fact that voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide have\nnot been more widely decriminalized is perhaps best explained along a\nsimilar line to the one that has frequently been offered for excluding\nthe consent of the victim as a justification for an act of killing,\nnamely the difficulties thought to exist in establishing the\ngenuineness of the consent. But, the establishment of suitable\nprocedures for giving consent to voluntary euthanasia and\nphysician-assisted suicide is surely no harder than establishing\nprocedures for competently refusing burdensome or otherwise unwanted\nmedical treatment. The latter has already been accomplished in many\njurisdictions, so the former should be achievable as well.\n\nSuppose that the moral case for legalizing voluntary euthanasia and\nphysician-assisted suicide does come to be judged more widely as\nstronger than the case against legalization, and they are made legally\npermissible in more jurisdictions than at present. Should doctors take\npart in the practice? Should only doctors perform voluntary\neuthanasia? These questions ought to be answered in light of the best\nunderstanding of what it is to provide medical care. The proper\nadministration of medical care should promote the welfare of patients\nwhile respecting their individual self-determination. It is these twin\nvalues that should guide medical care, not the preservation of life at\nall costs, or the preservation of life without regard to whether\npatients want their lives prolonged should they judge that life is no\nlonger of benefit or value to them. Many doctors in those\njurisdictions where medically assisted death has been legalized and,\nto judge from available survey evidence, in other liberal democracies\nas well, see the practice of voluntary euthanasia and\nphysician-assisted suicide as not only compatible with their\nprofessional commitments but also with their conception of the best\nmedical care for the dying. That being so, doctors of the same\nconviction in jurisdictions in which voluntary medically assisted\ndeath is currently illegal should no longer be prohibited by law from\nlending their professional assistance to competent terminally ill\npersons who request assistance with dying because of irremediable\nsuffering or because their lives no longer have value for them.\n",
