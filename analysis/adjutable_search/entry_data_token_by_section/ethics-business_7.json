    "main_text": "Firms and consumers || The limits of markets\n5.1 The limits of markets\n\nMany have argued that some things should not be for sale (Anderson\n1993; MacDonald & Gavura 2016; Sandel 2012; Satz 2010). Among the\nthings commonly said to be inappropriate for sale are sexual services,\nsurrogacy services, and human organs. Some writers object to markets\nin these items for consequentialist reasons. They argue that markets\nin commodities like sex and kidneys will lead to the exploitation of\nvulnerable people (Satz 2010). Others object to the attitudes or\nvalues expressed in such markets. They claim that markets in surrogacy\nservices express the attitude that women are mere vessels for the\nincubation of children (Anderson 1993); markets in kidneys suggest\nthat human life can be bought and sold (Sandel 2012); and so on. (For\na discussion of what it might mean for a market to\n\u201cexpress\u201d a value, see Jonker [2019].)\n\nOther writers criticize these arguments, and in general, the attempt\nto \u201cwall-off\u201d certain goods and services from markets.\nBrennan and Jaworksi (2016) object to expressive or\n\u201csemiotic\u201d arguments against markets in contested\ncommodities (cf. Brown & Maguire 2019). Whether selling a\nparticular thing for money expresses disrespect, they note, is\nculturally contingent. They and others (e.g., Taylor 2005) also argue\nthat the bad effects of markets in contested commodities can be\neliminated or at least ameliorated through appropriate regulation, and\nthat anyway, the good effects of such markets (e.g., a decrease in the\nnumber of people who die because they are waiting for a kidney)\noutweigh the bad.\n",
