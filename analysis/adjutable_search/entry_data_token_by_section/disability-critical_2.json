This more\ntraditional disability studies is an interdisciplinary field with\norigins in the promotion of the social model of disability (Mollow\n2017: 340; see the entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n Disability studies largely focuses on achieving political inclusion\nfor disabled people. To that end, work done under the auspices of\ndisability studies often uses the language of civil rights, minority\npolitics, and liberal justice frameworks. Simi Linton describes\ndisability studies as both a pedagogical effort\u2014a\n\u201cremedial endeavor, redressing the sins of omission and\ncommission in the canon\u201d\u2014and as a necessarily political\neffort focused on the \u201cepistemology of inclusion and\nintegration\u201d (1998: 525\u2013526). Linton cautions that there\nis a tendency within some academic fields, notably those in the health\nprofessions, to refer to themselves as \u201cdisability\nstudies\u201d by virtue of taking disabled people as objects of study\n(1998: 526). Yet, this is inaccurate, as disability studies takes the\nopposite approach, seeking leadership by disabled people and\ninvestigation into social circumstances. Along similar lines, it is\nimportant to notice that the language of disability studies has been\ncoopted, for example, by \u201crehabilitation and special education\ndepartments\u201d that remain tied to the medical model and are not\n\u201crewriting the script\u201d when it comes to disability\n(Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 49). Disability studies, working in\ntandem with the disability rights movement, shifts the focus from the\nmedical model and correlational intervention on disabled people to\nincrease \u201cfit\u201d in society to the \u201crigidity,\nfaultiness, deficits, and pathological structures\u201d in society\nitself (Linton 2005: 518). For example, Linton writes, \n\n\nDisability studies\u2019 project is to weave disabled people back\ninto the fabric of society\u2026as full citizens whose rights and\nprivileges are intact, whose history and contributions are recorded,\nand whose often distorted representations in art, literature, film,\ntheater, and other forms of artistic expression are fully analyzed.\n(ibid.)\n\n\nAs aforementioned, traditional disability studies relies on the social\nmodel. The social model explicitly draws from critical theory, which\nmakes it \u201cparadoxical\u201d that critical disability theory\nuses the same tradition to critique traditional disability studies\n(Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 50). Yet, for Meekosha and\nShuttleworth, the turn to the language of critical disability theory\nand away from the language of disability studies \n\n\nsignifies an implicit understanding that the terms of engagement in\ndisability studies have changed; that the struggle for social justice\nand diversity continues but on another plane of development\u2014one\nthat is not simply social, economic and political, but also\npsychological, cultural, discursive and carnal. (ibid.)\n\n\nCritical disability theory thus responds to the traditional disability\nstudies project by pointing to its limits, including exclusions and\nframing. Concerns and objects of critique include disability\nstudies\u2019 largely liberal approach (Sleeter 2010), narrow\nconsideration of physical disability, focus on the global North\n(Meekosha & Shuttleworth 2009: 49) and independent living (2009:\n52\u201353 and Kelly 2010), downplay of pain and suffering (Mollow\n2017: 350), and ties to or investment in class elitism (Erevelles\n& Kafer 2010: 208), neoliberalism (Sleeter 2010), masculinism\n(Kelly 2010), materialism (Vehmas & Watson 2014), somatophobia\n(Goodley, Liddiard, & Runswick Cole 2018: 201 and Snyder &\nMitchell 2001), and white supremacy (Bell 2006; Erevelles & Kafer\n2010: 208; and Moore, Lewis, & Brown 2018 \u2013 see Other\nInternet Resources).\n\nFurther, critical disability theory demonstrates the ways exclusions\nin traditional disability studies come about. Some differences, such\nas \u201cradical linguistic difference\u201d, including that\nintroduced by Deaf Studies, and \u201ccognitive disabilities and\nrelated communicative differences\u201d are regularly excluded from\ndisability studies (Erevelles & Kafer 2010: 212\u2013213). One\nway these exclusions occur is through investment in the figure of the\npublic disability studies scholar and activist, who attempts to\n\u201cdemonstrate a powerful, resistant, and rational voice in the\npublic arena\u201d; Nirmala Erevelles argues, \u201cmore often than\nnot, that voice embodies the normative modes of communication and\nrationality\u201d (2010: 213). Erevelles calls critical theoretical\nand political coalitions with those with cognitive difference and\nmental illness \u201cdangerous alliances\u201d, given the importance\ndisability studies has placed on embodying and using that voice (2010:\n214). She advocates for brokering these alliances and defusing the\ndominant voice of disability studies. On a different note, Erevelles\nsees radical potential in Deaf Studies, but recommends it remain its\nown field to maintain positive tension with other areas of disability\nstudies (2010: 210\u2013212). Critique in these areas, and others,\nhas led to the growth of critical disability theory and set its\nagenda.\n\nCriticisms along these lines is well-received by some theorists. For\nexample, Ann Fox frames such criticism as a reminder that the\ntraditional disability studies must strive to be\n\u201ccritical\u201d; she specifically notes the problems of \n\n\n[disability studies\u2019] erasure of bodies of color, reinforcing\nhierarchies, policing points of view, and moments of careerism over\ncoalition. (2017)\n\n\nOthers, meanwhile, argue that criticisms are unfair and stem from a\nmisguided approach. For example, Simo Vehmas and Nick Watson defend\ndisability studies against some key challenges made by \u201ccritical\ndisability studies\u201d, including a rejection of disability\nstudies\u2019 materialism (in this case, the authors mean classical\nMarxist theory; Vehmas & Watson 2014). Referring to critical\ndisability theorists as \u201cpost-structural anti-dualists\u201d,\nVehmas and Watson reject their approach as lacking the foundation to\ndo normative, and therefore necessary political, work (2014:\n638\u2013639). They write, \u201c[Critical Disability Studies] does\nnot examine how things ought to be for disabled people in terms of\nright and wrong, good and bad\u201d (2014: 638). Yet, critical\ndisability theorists consistently conceive of themselves as doing\nnormative and political work. For example, Margrit Shildrick responds\nto the critique that her feminist postmodernism is non-normative. She\nwrites, \n\n\nthe very absence of laws, absolutes, and guiding rules and principles\nnecessitates a high degree of personal responsibility in the face of\nthe demand for response, \n\n\nwhich issues in a \u201cprofound engagement with the issues at\nhand\u201d (2008: 33; see also Shildrick 2012).\n\nAs aforementioned, some critical disability theorists worry that pain\nis not taken seriously enough in traditional disability studies\n(Mollow 2017, 350). Yet, those working to transform traditional\ndisability studies have not settled the role of pain in critical work\non disability. Indeed, the question of pain behaves as metonymy for\nthe role of embodiment in disability more generally (Tremain 2017:\n114). Some have argued that, as the lasting impacts of the social\nmodel of disability drives theorists away from embodiment and toward\npolitical and social descriptions of disability, the body has been\nlost. Feminist thinkers of disability like Jenny Morris want to\nmaintain a narrative of disability by which they can achieve\nrecognition of the obstacles that bodies can present. According to\ndisability theorists Tom Shakespeare and Mark Erickson, these\nthinkers: \n\n\ndo not deny that society causes many problems, [but] they also feel\nthat their bodies may cause difficulties, and they want any theory of\ndisability to take account of the physical dimension to their lives.\nThey suggest that in developing a social and structural analysis the\ndisability movement has omitted a key facet of their experience.\n(2001: 195) \n\n\nIndeed, Susan Wendell argues that the desire to relegate pain, and the\npossibility of pain, to an \u201cother\u201d while fantasizing about\na \u201cnormal\u201d body importantly undergirds ableist exclusions\nand the refusal of disabled people. For her, attending to pain must\nplay a role in becoming reconciled to one\u2019s body (1996: 179).\nSo, to disregard pain and its role in disability would be to\nmisunderstand hierarchies of normality. Shelley Tremain, however,\nmaintains a tight focus on the social and political, arguing that\n\u201cpain and the experience of it are historically and culturally\nrelative and interpreted\u201d (Tremain 2017: 116). Whether or not\npain is denied, and how pain is seen to play a role in disability, has\nbecome a flashpoint in critical disability theory.\n\nThese tensions, and more, have arisen in the literature. Even as\nseismic transformation occurs, it is not clear whether critical\ndisability theory is a new movement or the continued development of\nmore traditional disability studies. Language use varies among\ntheorists as well as among intersectional, politically engaged work on\ndisability that emerges in multiple scholarly circles. Along these\nlines, Meekosha and Shuttleworth wonder if critical disability theory\n\u201cconstitutes a radical paradigm shift or simply signifies a\nmaturing of [disability studies]\u201d (2009: 48). This entry will\nnot attempt to settle this matter, as it is not settled; rather, it\nwill cover those signature methods and topics that theorists largely\nagree count as developing work in critical disability theory.\n",
