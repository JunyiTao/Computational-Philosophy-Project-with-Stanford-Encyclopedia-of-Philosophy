    "main_text": "The Logic of Begriffsschrift || The Operators of Begriffsschrift\n2.1 The Operators of Begriffsschrift\n2.1.1 The Judgement Stroke\n\nThe judgement stroke is perhaps the aspect of Frege\u2019s\nlogic, in both versions, that has been the subject of the most\ncontroversy. Simply put, the judgement stroke, in the logic of\nBegriffsschrift, transforms a judgeable content into\na judgement:\n\n\nA judgement will always be expressed by means of the symbol \n\n\n \n\nwhich stands to the left of the symbol or complex of symbols which\ngives the content of the judgement. If the small vertical stroke at\nthe left end of the horizontal one \\(|\\) is omitted, then the\njudgement will be transformed into a mere complex of ideas,\nof which the writer does not state whether he recognizes its truth or\nnot. For example, let \n\n\n \n\nmean the judgement \u201cOpposite magnetic poles attract one\nanother\u201d, then \n\n\n \n\nwill not express this judgement, but should merely arouse in the\nreader the idea of the mutual attraction of opposite magnetic poles,\nin order, say, to draw conclusions from it and by means of these to\ntest the correctness of the thought. In this we paraphrase\nusing the words \u201cthe circumstance that\u201d or \u201cthe\nproposition that\u201d. (1879a: \u00a72)\n\n\nIn Begriffsschrift Frege makes it clear that not every\nconceptual content is a judgeable content, and hence not every\nexpression (and definitely not every name of an object) is eligible to\nbe the argument of the judgement stroke:\n\n\nNot every content can become a judgement by placing\n\nbefore its symbol; for example, the idea \u201chouse\u201d cannot.\nWe therefore distinguish judgeable and unjudgeable\ncontents. (1879a: \u00a72)\n\n\nHe concludes his discussion of the rejection of the subject-predicate\nanalysis of propositions in favor of his function-argument approach,\ndiscussed above, with the following observation regarding the role of\nthe judgement stroke:\n\n\nImagine a language in which the proposition \u201cArchimedes was\nkilled at the capture of Syracuse\u201d is expressed in the following\nway: \u201cThe violent death of Archimedes at the capture of Syracuse\nis a fact\u201d. Even here, if one wants, subject and predicate can\nbe distinguished, but the subject contains the whole content, and the\npredicate serves only to present it as a judgement. Such a\nlanguage would have only a single predicate for all judgements, namely\n\u201cis a fact\u201d. It can be seen that there is no question\nhere of subject and predicate in the usual sense. Our\nBegriffsschrift is such a language and the symbol\n\nis its common predicate for all judgements. (1879a: \u00a73)\n\n\nShortly after introducing the judgement stroke in\nBegriffsschrift, Frege makes the claim that it is composed of\ntwo parts, the horizontal stroke \u201c\n\n\u201d and the vertical stroke \u201c\\(|\\)\u201d,\nwhich is the judgement stroke\nproper, and he suggests that the horizontal unites the component parts\nof the judgeable content that follows into a whole:\n\n\nThe horizontal stroke, from which the symbol\n\nis formed, binds the symbols that follow it into a whole, and\nassertion, which is expressed by means of the vertical stroke at the\nleft end of the horizontal, relates to this whole. The horizontal\nstroke may be called the content stroke, the vertical the\njudgement stroke. The content stroke serves generally to\nrelate any symbol to the whole formed by the symbols that follow the\nstroke. What follows the content stroke must always have a\njudgeable content. (1879a: \u00a72)\n\n\nNote the fact that arguments of the judgement stroke are restricted to\ncontents that are judgeable (loosely put, to sentences, in an informal\nsense of the term), hence \u201c\n\n\\(2\\)\u201d is, in the logic of Begriffsschrift, not\na falsehood but is merely not well-formed. We will return to the\nimportance of this observation in understanding the differences\nbetween Frege\u2019s two logics below. But the horizontal does little\nactual work in the logic of Begriffsschrift: it never occurs\nin isolation.\n2.1.2 The Conditional Stroke\n\nNext up is the conditional stroke. In Begriffsschrift Frege\nexplains the conditional stroke as follows:\n\n\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) denote judgeable contents (\u00a72), then there are\nthe following four possibilities:\n\n\\(A\\) is affirmed and \\(B\\) is affirmed;\n\\(A\\) is affirmed and \\(B\\) is denied;\n\\(A\\) is denied and \\(B\\) is affirmed;\n\\(A\\) is denied and \\(B\\) is denied.\n\n\n\n \n\nnow denotes the judgement that the third of these possibilities\ndoes not obtain, but one of the other three does. Accordingly, if\n\n\n\n \n\nis denied, then this is to say that the third possibility does obtain;\ni.e., that \\(A\\) is denied and \\(B\\) is affirmed. (1879a: \u00a75)\n\n\nSimply put, the conditional stroke is Frege\u2019s\nBegriffsschrift version of the material conditional: it\ncombines two conceptual contents into a single complex conceptual\ncontent that denotes a fact if and only if it is not the case that the\nfirst denotes a fact yet the second does not. In modern terminology,\nthe consequent of the conditional (what Frege will call the\nsupercomponent in the logic of Grundgesetze) occurs\nabove the antecedent (what Frege will call the subcomponent\nin the logic of Grundgesetze). Note the explicit restriction\nof the arguments of the conditional stroke to judgeable contents.\n\nAlthough Frege does not discuss this as explicitly in\nBegriffsschrift as he does in Grundgesetze, it is\nworth noting that complex conditional stroke constructions can be\nparsed into antecedent and consequence in multiple ways. Consider:\n\n\n\n \n\nThis expression is analogous (but of course not equivalent, in any\nreasonable sense of equivalent) to \u201c\\(C\n\\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow A )\\)\u201d in modern notation. But\nFrege often treats expressions of this form as instead expressing\nsomething more akin to the (classically) equivalent \u201c\\((C\n\\land B) \\rightarrow A\\)\u201d. In\nshort, Frege switches back and forth between reading the offset\nformula above as a (binary) conditional with \u201c\\(C\\)\u201d\nas antecedent and\n\n\n\n\nas consequent, and as a (ternary) conditional with both \u201c\\(C\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(B\\)\u201d\nas antecedents and \u201c\\(A\\)\u201d\nas consequent (this will\nbecome relevant in our discussion of his rules of inference\nbelow).\n2.1.3 The Negation Stroke\n\nThe third notion introduced by Frege in Begriffsschrift is\nthe negation stroke:\n\n\nIf a small vertical stroke is attached to the underside of the content\nstroke, then this is intended to express the circumstance that the\nthe content does not obtain. Thus, for example, \n\n\n\n\n\nmeans \u201c\\(A\\) does not obtain\u201d. I call this small vertical\nstroke the negation stroke. The part of the horizontal stroke\nto the right of the negation stroke is the content stroke of \\(A\\),\nthe part to the left of the negation stroke, on the other hand, is the\ncontent stroke of the negation of \\(A\\). (1879a: \u00a77)\n\n\nAlthough it is not obvious that Frege thought of propositional logic\nas an identifiable subsystem of the logic of Begriffsschrift\n(or of the logic of Grundgesetze), negation and the\nconditional stroke are the only (Fregean analogues) of propositional\noperators that Frege introduces into either logic (identity does play\nsomething like the role of the biconditional in both the logic of\nBegriffsschrift and the logic of Grundgesetze).\nFrege does not offer an expressive completeness result (and it is not\nlikely that he was in a position, conceptually, to even state such a\nresult at the time of writing Begriffsschrift). But he\nconcludes \u00a77 of Begriffsschrift by gesturing in this\ndirection, noting that these two operators allow us to express what we\nnow call inclusive disjunction, exclusive disjunction, and conjunction\nas: \n\n\n\n\n\ninclusive disjunction\n\n\n\n\n\nexclusive disjunction\n\n\n\n\n\nconjunction\n\n\n\nrespectively.\n2.1.4 The Identity Operator\n\nFrege next introduces what has become perhaps the most notorious part\nof the logic of Begriffsschrift, his identity operator. Frege\nis clearly struggling with the puzzles that he would eventually solve\nin \u201cSense and Reference\u201d via the titular distinction, but\nthat notion is not yet available, and as a result he is faced with the\nfollowing puzzle: Given two names \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d,\nif \u201c\\(a\n= b\\)\u201d is true, and, if the\nconceptual content of names are their referents, then \u201c\\(a\n= a\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(a\n= b\\)\u201d have the same conceptual\ncontent. But this cannot be the case: \u201c\\(a =\na\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(a =\nb\\)\u201d clearly do not have the same conceptual\ncontent, since they imply different things.\n\nAs a result, Frege is forced to deny that \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d\nhave the same conceptual\ncontent, at least in the context of identity claims. Hence, their\nconceptual content cannot be their referents. Frege concludes that the\nconceptual content of names within identity statements are the names\nthemselves, defining identity as follows (it is worth noting that he\nuses \u201c\\(\\equiv\\)\u201d here, but\nmoves to the somewhat more standard notation \u201c\\(=\\)\u201d\nin Grundgesetze once\nhe has solved these problems):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis therefore to mean: the symbol \\(A\\) and the symbol \\(B\\) have\nthe same conceptual content, so that \\(A\\) can always be replaced by\n\\(B\\) and vice versa. (1879a: \u00a77)\n\n\nThis solves the problem, since in the context of a true identity claim\nlike \u201c\\(a = b\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d\ndo not pick out the same\nthing. Instead, \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nself-referentially picks out the symbol \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\n(and similarly for \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d),\nand as a result the identity\nclaim \u201c\\(a = b\\)\u201d does not\nexpress (loosely put):\n\n\n\\(a\\) is the same as \\(b\\)\n\n\nbut instead something like (again, loosely put):\n\n\nThe thing picked out by \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nis the same as the thing picked out by \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d.\n\n\nwhich has a different conceptual content from:\n\n\nThe thing picked out by \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nis the same as the thing picked out by \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d.\n\n\nAs a result, names within Begriffsschrift formulas such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nare forced to do double-duty: In the antecedent of the conditional\nabove, the occurrences of \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d\neffectively denote themselves.\nIn the consequent of this conditional, however, \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d\ndenote more straightforwardly,\nto whatever objects these names actually name.\n\nFrege is quite aware of the difficulties that arise as a result of\nthis understanding of identity, beginning \u00a78 of\nBegriffsschrift with the following observation:\n\n\nIdentity of content differs from negation and conditionality by\nrelating to names, not to contents. Whilst elsewhere symbols simply\nrepresent their contents, so that each combination into which they\nenter merely expresses a relation between their contents, they at once\nstand for themselves as soon as they are combined by the symbol for\nidentity of content; for this signifies the circumstances that two\nnames have the same content. Thus with the introduction of a symbol\nfor identity of content a bifurcation in the meaning of every symbol\nis necessarily effected, the same symbols standing one moment for\ntheir content, the next for themselves. (1879a: \u00a78)\n\n\nA solution to this problem would have to wait until the introduction\nof the sense/reference distinction.\n\nWe have so far restricted our attention to the application of the\nidentity symbol to names of objects. But Frege, in\nBegriffsschrift, never restricts the application of the\nidentity symbol in this manner, requiring only that its application be\nrestricted in such a way that only judgeable contents result. Thus,\nwithin the logic of Begriffsschrift the identity symbol can\nbe applied to any two arguments, rather than merely between\nobjects.\n2.1.5 The Concavity for Expressing Generality\n\nFinally, we have Frege\u2019s device for expressing generality within\nBegriffsschrift: the concavity:\n\n\nIn the expression of a judgement, the complex of symbols to the right\nof\n\ncan always be regarded as a function of one of the symbols occurring\nin it. If a Gothic letter is put in place of the argument, and a\nconcavity containing this letter inserted in the content stroke, as\nin \n\n\n\n\n\nthen this signifies the judgement that the function is a fact\nwhatever may be taken as its argument. Since a letter used as a\nsymbol for a function, such as \\(\\Phi\\) in \\(\\Phi(A)\\), can be\nregarded as the argument of a function, it can be replaced by a Gothic\nletter in the manner just specified. The meaning of the Gothic letter\nis subject only to the obvious restrictions that the complex of\nsymbols following a content stroke must still remain judgeable\n(\u00a72), and that, if the Gothic letter occurs as a symbol for a\nfunction, this circumstance must be taken into account. All other\nconditions which must be imposed on what may replace a Gothic letter\nare to be included in the judgement. (1879a: \u00a711)\n\n\nThus, the concavity is the Begriffsschrift version of\n(something like) the universal quantifier, and a formula of the form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis true (or, in the terminology Frege mobilizes in\nBegriffsschrift, is a fact) if and only if, for any\nargument whatsoever, applying the function denoted by\n\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\) to that argument is true (or, again, is a fact). Note\nthat Frege explicitly restricts the formation of formulas in the logic\nof Begriffsschrift so that the concavity can only bind a\nfunction that outputs a judgeable content when an appropriate argument\nis filled in\u2014hence, in the logic of Begriffsschrift\n\u201c\n\n\\(\\mathfrak{a}+1\\)\u201d is not well-formed.\n\nWe can now add a bit more detail to the explication of the differences\nbetween Frege\u2019s Begriffsschrift distinction between\nfunction and argument, and the more modern-looking hierarchy of\nobjects, first-level functions, second-level functions, and\nthird-level functions that will appear within the logic of\nGrundgesetze. Properly understood: \n\n\n\n\n\nwithin Begriffsschrift does not assert that:\n\n\nFor any object \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\), \\(\\Phi(\\mathfrak{a})\\) is a fact.\n\n\nbut instead says something like;\n\n\nFor any entity (of whatever \u201ctype\u201d or \u201csort\u201d)\n\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) such that the combination of \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\) with\n\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) results in a judgeable content,\n\\(\\Phi(\\mathfrak{a})\\) is a fact.\n\n\nIn understanding the quantified statement in this manner, we are free\nto understand \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) as the argument, and \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\) as\nthe function, or \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\) as the argument, and \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\)\nas the function, subject only to the requirement that the combination\nof \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) and \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\) result in a judgeable content.\nOf course, if \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\) is a function that only maps objects to\njudgeable contents, then the upshot is the same as standard\nfirst-order quantification. But Frege has, to emphasize this point\nonce again, not yet introduced the conceptual machinery that allow him\nto identify such functions, nor has he ever claimed that a particular\nfunction must only take one type of entity (that is, take only\nobjects, or only functions, etc.) as arguments.\n\nOne clear indication that the sort of hierarchy that is mobilized\nwithin the logic of Grundgesetze in order to clean all this\nup is not present\u2014not even implicitly, in the\nbackground\u2014within the logic of Begriffsschrift is that\nFrege does not introduce distinct quantifiers for distinct kinds of\nentity (not even for function and argument). Although Frege uses\ndifferent styles of variable to suggest that some quantifications\nrange over arguments, and others over functions, this is merely\nheuristic\u2014and it must be, since, as we have already seen, within\nthe logic of Begriffsschrift the function/argument\ndistinction is not a metaphysical distinction found in the world, but\ninstead merely reflects different ways that one might parse the same\nstatement. Thus, the (single universal) quantifier in the logic of\nBegriffsschrift ranges over both objects and functions\n(albeit in a rather complicated manner), and modern first- and\nhigher-order quantifiers do not actually appear within\nBegriffsschrift in the way that they clearly appear within\nthe logic of Grundgesetze. Rather, there is a single\nquantifier that ranges over objects and functions (and concepts, and\nrelations, etc.) alike, and the informal restrictions on what\nconstructions are licit (i.e., that the result of applying function to\nargument must result in a judgeable content) constrain the potential\nrange of each instance of this quantifier. Thus, the quantifiers of\nthe logic of Begriffsschrift bear a rather limited\nresemblance to modern quantifiers (see Kemp 1995 and Heck & May\n2013 for arguments that this construction in Begriffsschrift\ndoesn\u2019t even count as a genuine quantifier in the first\nplace).\n\nFrege has a second way of expressing generality\u2014Roman letters.\nAs we shall see, there is some controversy about how to understand the\nway in which this device is meant to be understood within the logic of\nGrundgesetze. But there is no mystery regarding how they are\nmeant to be understood within the logic of Begriffsschrift,\nsince within the earlier work Frege states explicitly that the Roman\nletter generality device is an abbreviation for a special, and\nespecially important, instance of the German letter, concavity version\nof universal quantification:\n\n\nOnly within its scope does a Gothic letter retain its\nmeaning; the same Gothic letter can occur within various scopes\nin one judgement, without the meaning that may be ascribed to it in\none scope carrying over to the others. The scope of a Gothic letter\ncan include another, as the example: \n\n\n\n\n\nshows. In this case different letters must be chosen;\n\\(\\mathfrak{e}\\) may not be replaced by \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\). It is, of\ncourse permitted to replace a Gothic letter everywhere in its scope by\nanother particular one, provided that there are still different\nletters standing where different letters stood before. This has no\neffect on the content. Other substitutions are only allowable if\nthe concavity immediately follows the judgement stroke, so that\nthe content of the whole judgement makes up the scope of the Gothic\nletter. Accordingly, since this case is particularly important, I\nshall introduce the following abbreviation for it. An italic\nletter always has as its scope the content of the whole judgement,\nwithout this needing to be signified by a concavity in the content\nstroke. (1879a: \u00a711)\n\n\nFrege is quite explicit here: The occurrence of Roman (or italic)\nletters in a formula of the logic of Begriffsschrift is\nnothing more than an abbreviation of the corresponding formula with\nthe Roman variables replaced by corresponding Gothic variables, and\nthe concavities corresponding to those variables placed immediately\nafter the judgement stroke. Thus, the formula appearing in the\nquotation above is, in the logic of Begriffsschrift, merely\nan abbreviation for: \n\n\n\n\n\nand the Roman letter generality device is meant to remind the reader\nthat the restrictions on substitution (effectively protecting against\na clash of variables) that govern substitutions of German variables in\ngeneral do not apply to variables bound by concavities in\nwhat we would call prenex position.\n\nWhile this is Frege\u2019s official understanding of Roman letters,\nhe often treats formulas containing Roman letters as if they were\nsubstitution instances of the corresponding concavity-bound universal\nformulas\u2014that is, as cases where the Roman letters pick out\nparticular functions and arguments. While this deserves more attention\nthan can be given here, there is a practical reason that forces Frege\nto make some such move: Since he has not introduced any name-forming\noperators within Begriffsschrift, the language does not\ncontain the resources to express any particular claims.\n2.2 The Axioms and Rules of Begriffsschrift\n\nThe logic of Begriffsschrift officially contains nine axioms\nand one rule, although two additional rules, used repeatedly\nthroughout the derivations, are explicated more informally \u201cin\npassing\u201d by Frege. Within the derivations of\nBegriffsschrift, Frege numbers formulas sequentially in terms\nof their occurrence within the sequence of derivations, and only\nintroduces an axiom when it is needed\u2014hence the axioms are\nformulas 1, 2, 8, 28, 31, 41, 52, 54, and 58 on his numbering. I have\nprovided a more convenient, conventional 1 through 9 numbering in the\ndiscussion, and this numbering will be used in the comparison between\nthis system and the collection of axioms and rules given in\nGrundgesetze.\n2.2.1 The Axioms\n\n\n\n\nAxiom 1 (Formula 1, 1879a: \u00a714)\n\n\nThis is the Begriffsschrift analogue of: \n\\[A \\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow A)\\]\n\n\nalthough care should be taken, since Frege\u2019s axiom, with its use\nof Roman letters, is a quantified formula, not a schema, and is\nperhaps better rendered as:  \n\\[\\forall A\\; \\forall B (A \\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow A))\\]\n\n\nwhere the quantifiers range over judgeable contents. Frege defends\nthis axiom as follows:\n\n\n[this axiom]\u2026 says: \u201cThe case in which \\(a\\) is denied,\n\\(b\\) is affirmed and \\(a\\) is affirmed is excluded\u201d. This is\nobvious since \\(a\\) cannot be denied and affirmed at the same time. We\ncan also express the judgement in words this way: \u201cIf a\nproposition \\(a\\) holds, it holds also in the case an arbitrary\nproposition \\(b\\) holds\u201d. (1879a: \u00a714)\n\n\nAxiom 2 (Formula 2) is equally straightforward, so long as we remember\nthat it is an abbreviation for a formula quantifying over judgeable\ncontents:\n\n\n\n\nAxiom 2 (Formula 2, 1879a: \u00a715)\n\n\nFrege\u2019s argument that this axiom must be true stretches over\nfour pages, and will not be reproduced here. The argument for Axiom 1\nquoted above should give readers a feel for the flavor of\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift justifications for particular\naxioms (and similar comments apply to the later, even more complex\naxioms). The intuitive validity of this axiom should be clear, since\nit is a Begriffsschrift analogue of something like:\n\n\\[\\forall C\\; \\forall B\\; \\forall A(C \\rightarrow\n(B \\rightarrow A)) \\rightarrow ((C \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow (C\n\\rightarrow A))\\]\n\n\nwhere the quantifiers range over judgeable contents.\n\nThe next axiom, Axiom 3 (Formula 8), allows (in combination with\nFrege\u2019s version of modus ponens, see below) for the\nre-arrangement of antecedents of a conditional:\n\n\n\n\nAxiom 3 (Formula 8, 1879a: \u00a716)\n\n\nThis axiom will be replaced by a (more general) rule in the logic of\nGrundgesetze.\n\nAxiom 4 (Formula 28) (again, in combination with Frege\u2019s version\nof modus ponens) provides a version of contraposition.\n\n\n\n\nAxiom 4 (Formula 28, 1879a: \u00a717)\n\n\nAs with Axiom 3, this axiom will be replaced by a much more general\nrule in Grundgesetze.\n\nAxiom 5 (Formula 31) and Axiom 6 (Formula 41) are a pair of sorts,\nproviding us with Frege\u2019s axiomatic versions of double negation\nintroduction and double negation elimination:\n\n\n\n\nAxiom 5 (Formula 31, 1879a: \u00a718)\n\n\n\n\n\nAxiom 6 (Formula 41, 1879a: \u00a719)\n\n\nThese axioms, plus Frege\u2019s version of modus ponens,\ncomplete what we might think of as the propositional portion of the\nlogic of Begriffsschrift. \u0141ukasiewicz proves that a\nmodern transcription of these axioms, plus a modern transcription of\nFrege\u2019s version of modus ponens, are sound and complete\nwith respect to classical logic with propositional quantifiers, and he\nalso proves that (the modern transcription of) Axiom 3 is redundant in\nthe context of (modern transcriptions of) the other axioms plus,\nagain, modus ponens (\u0141ukasiewicz 1934). Of course, the\nusual warnings regarding transcribing Frege\u2019s notations into\nmodern ones, and assuming that his notion of judgeable content (the\nrange of the quantifiers that occur in Axioms 1 through 6) is the same\nas a more modern notion of proposition or sentence, apply to this\nresult.\n\nFrege\u2019s discussion of Axioms 5 and 6 also provide a nice\nillustration of the sorts of changes that occur in Frege\u2019s\nlogical thinking between the composition of Begriffsschrift\nand the composition of Grundgesetze. In the preface to\nBegriffsschrift Frege notes that:\n\n\nI realized later that formulas (31) and (41) can be combined into the\nsingle one \n\n\n\n\n\nwhich makes a few more simplifications possible. (1879a: Preface)\n\n\nThis principle, in combination with Axiom 7 and Frege\u2019s version\nof modus ponens, does entail Axioms 5 and 6. Further, there\nis every reason to think that this principle is valid on the informal\nsemantics Frege gives in Begriffsschrift, since (in\nBegriffsschrift) the variables are restricted to judgeable\ncontents, and there seems little reason to doubt that the judgeable\ncontent denoted by \n\n\\(a\\) is identical to the judgeable content denoted by\n\\(a\\).\n\nAll of this, however, is subject to an important caveat: the\nquantifiers within the logic of Begriffsschrift are\nconstrained in a way that the quantifiers in Grundgesetze are\nnot. Within the logic of Begriffsschrift Frege requires that\nthe quantifiers be restricted so that the result of applying logical\noperators to entities in the range of the relevant quantifiers results\nin judgeable contents. As a result, formulas that are valid\non the Begriffsschrift understanding of the logic are no\nlonger valid on the Grundgesetze understanding. In\nparticular, as we shall see: \n\n\n\n\n\nis true on the intended interpretation of (the consistent,\nvalue-range-free fragment of) the logic of Grundgesetze.\n\nThe next two axioms are relatively straightforward. Axiom 7 (Formula\n52) provides an axiomatic version of the indiscernibility of\nidenticals:\n\n\n\n\nAxiom 7 (Formula 52, 1879a: \u00a720)\n\n\nA much stronger version of this axiom will make an appearance in the\nlogic of Grundgesetze.\n\nAnd Axiom 8 (Formula 54) provides us with self-identity:\n\n\n\n\nAxiom 8 (Formula 54, 1879a: \u00a721)\n\n\nAgain, this axiom applies to any argument \\(c\\) (that is, to anything\nwhatsoever), not just to objects.\n\nAxiom 9 (Formula 58) is for our purposes a bit more interesting, not\nfor what it says, but instead for what it leaves out. Axiom 9 allows\nus, in essence, to replace a German letter bound by a concavity in the\nantecedent of a conditional with a Roman letter:\n\n\n\n\nAxiom 9 (Formula 58, 1879a: \u00a722)\n\n\nNote that Frege does not provide a corresponding second-order version\nof this axiom (as he does in Grundgesetze)\u2014rather, this\naxiom should be read as covering both the first- and second-order\ncase, thus expressing something along the lines of:\n\n\nFor any function \\(f\\) and for any argument \\(c\\) such that \\(f(c)\\)\nis a judgeable content: if, for any argument \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) such\nthat \\(f(\\mathfrak{a})\\) is a judgeable content, \\(f(\\mathfrak{a})\\)\nis a fact, then \\(f(c)\\) is a fact.\n\n\nrather than:\n\n\nFor any (first-level) function \\(f\\) and for any object \\(c\\): if, for\nany object \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\), \\(f(\\mathfrak{a})\\) is a fact, then\n\\(f(c)\\) is a fact.\n\n2.2.2 The Rules of Inference\n\nOn to the rules of inference. In the preface to\nBegriffsschrift, Frege claims that he only uses one mode of\ninference:\n\n\nThe restriction, in \u00a76, to a single mode of inference is\njustified by the fact that in laying the foundations of such\na Begriffsschrift the primitive elements must be as simple as\npossible if perspicuity and order are to be achieved. (1879a: Preface)\n\n\n\nThe rule in question is a version of modus ponens, which\nFrege explains as follows:\n\n\nFrom the explanation given in \u00a75 it is clear that from the two\njudgements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthe new judgement \n\n\\(A\\) follows. Of our four cases enumerated above, the third is\nexcluded by\n\n\n\n\n\nand the second and fourth by \n\n\\(B\\), so that only the first is left. (1879a: \u00a76) \n\n\nThe four cases Frege is referring to are the four possible\ncombinations of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) being, or failing to be, facts given\nin the explanation of the conditional stroke, quoted above.\n\nAt first glance, this appears to be the familiar rule of modus\nponens, but in fact it is a good bit more complicated. Frege\nroutinely applies the rule to pairs of formulas that contain Roman\nletters. Remembering that in Begriffsschrift Roman letters\nare abbreviations for prenex concavity quantifiers, the simple case\nthat Frege uses in his explication of this rule is really shorthand\nfor the transition from: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto: \n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the quantifiers range over judgeable contents. As a result, this\nrule, as he applies is throughout Begriffsschrift, is not the\npropositional rule modus ponens at all. Instead, it is an\nanalogue of something like the following (in modern notation): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n~ & \\forall a_1\\forall a_2\\dots \\forall a_n\\forall b_1\\forall b_2\\dots \\forall b_m\\forall c_1\\forall c_2\\dots\n\\forall c_k\\\\\n&(\\Phi_1(a_1, a_2, \\dots a_n, b_1, b_2, \\dots b_m) \\rightarrow\n\\Phi_2(a_1, a_2, \\dots a_n, c_1, c_2, \\dots c_k))\\\\\n[P_2]~ & \\forall a_1\\forall a_2\\dots \\forall a_n\\forall b_1\\forall b_2\\dots \\forall b_m (\\Phi_1(a_1, a_2, \\dots a_n, b_1,\nb_2, \\dots b_m))\\\\\n\\hline\\\\\n[C]~ & \\forall a_1\\forall a_2\\dots \\forall a_n\\forall c_1\\forall c_2\\dots \\forall c_k(\\Phi_2(a_1, a_2, \\dots a_n, c_1,\nc_2, \\dots c_k))\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nThere are two things to notice about the rule, understood in this\nway.\n\nFirst off, once we recognize the role played by the (German-letter\nbound) quantifiers abbreviated by Roman letters in any instance of the\nrule, it is clear that Frege\u2019s defense of the rule is utterly\ninadequate. Frege\u2019s argument would be adequate for a particular\nsubstitution instance of the rule, where no Roman letters appeared.\nBut it doesn\u2019t address the much more general principle that\ncodifies the manner in which he in fact applies the rule throughout\nBegriffsschrift.\n\nSecond, this is not, in fact, a single rule at all, but is instead a\nschema for infinitely many rules: one for each triple of sequences of\nvariables \\(a_1, a_2, a_n\\); \\(b_1, b_2,\\dots b_m\\); and \\(c_1,\nc_2,\\dots c_k\\), where not only the number of \\(a_i\\)s, \\(b_i\\)s, and\n\\(c_i\\)s in each instance can vary, but their type (where, remember,\nthese are argument variables and function variables, not object\nvariables and function variables) can vary as well. It does not seem\nunlikely that the strongly schematic flavor of this rule would have\nbothered Frege, given that his interest was in giving particular\nlogical principles from which we could derive particular universal\nlogical truths. As a result, it is perhaps unsurprising that Frege\nwill give a completely different (albeit somewhat unclear) account of\nthe role of Roman letters in Grundgesetze.\n\nAlthough Frege claims that this version of modus ponens is\nhis only rule of inference in the preface to Begriffsschrift,\nhe modifies this claim later in the work, noting that:\n\n\nIn logic, following Aristotle, a whole series of modes of inference\nare enumerated; I use just this one\u2014at least in all cases where\na new judgement is derived from more than one single judgement.\n(1879a: \u00a76) \n\n\nThe two rules that Frege has in mind, which involve the transition\nfrom a single judgement to a single judgement, are rules that we shall\ncall concavity-introduction and a rule of substitution (Frege does not\ngive them names).\n\nFrege explains the rule of concavity-introduction as follows:\n\n\nAn italic letter may always be replaced by a Gothic letter that\ndoes not yet occur in the judgement, the concavity being inserted\nimmediately after the judgement stroke. E.g. instead of: \n\n\n\n\n\none can put: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nif \\(a\\) occurs only in the argument-places of \\(X(a)\\): It is\nalso clear that from: \n\n\n\n\n\none can derive: \n\n\n\n\n\nif \\(A\\) is an expression in which \\(a\\) does not occur, and if\n\\(a\\) stands only in the argument place of \\(\\Phi(a)\\). (1879a:\n\u00a711) \n\nFrege then gives a second example that takes advantage of the fact\nthat conditional stroke constructions can be parsed into antecedent(s)\nand consequent in more than one way:\n\n\nSimilarly, from: \n\n\n\n\n\nwe can deduce: \n\n\n\n\n\n(1879a: \u00a711) \n\n\nFrege\u2019s concavity-introduction rule operates as follows: Given\nany formula containing a Roman letter, we can infer any proposition\nthat uniformly replaces the Roman letter with a German letter and\ninserts a concavity containing the same German letter immediately in\nfront of some consequent that contains all occurrences of the\nnew German letter (recalling that formulas can be parsed into\nconsequent and antecedent in more than one way), or the concavity can\nbe placed in front or the entire formula (after the judgement stroke).\nThe new German letter must be chosen so that it does not\n\u201cconflict\u201d with other German letters already present in\nthe original proposition. Looking at a more complex example, if \u201c\\(A\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(B\\)\u201d\nare any formulas not\ncontaining the Roman letter \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d,\nand \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(\\Psi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\ndo not contain \u201c\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\)\u201d,\nthen from: \n\n\n\n\n\nwe can infer any of: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut not: \n\n\n\n\n\nThis rule does not really involve \u201cintroducing\u201d a\nconcavity within the logic of Begriffsschrift, since the\nRoman letter being replaced is, of course, an abbreviation of an\ninstance of the concavity. Instead, this rule is a means for\nmoving a concavity from one location to another. The name\n\u201cconcavity introduction\u201d is thus used here to emphasize\nthe connection between this rule and the syntactically similar rule\nfound in the logic of Grundgesetze (where Roman letters are,\nas we shall see, not an abbreviation of corresponding initial\nconcavities, but are a second, completely separate device for\nachieving universal generality, and hence the rule does involve\nintroducing a concavity not present beforehand).\n\nFrege\u2019s final rule of inference in Begriffsschrift is a\nrule of substitution: Once one has proven a particular formula, one\nmay, in later derivations, make use, not only of the proven formula\nitself, but also of the result of carrying out any uniform\nsubstitution of expressions for Roman letters occurring in the\noriginal\u2014again, subject to the requirement that the formula and\nall relevant sub-formulas are judgeable contents. Jean van Heijenoort\nargues, in his introductory essay on Begriffsschrift, that\nFrege applies his rule of substitution in illicit ways\u2014ways that\nwill lead to contradictions. See the supplementary essay\n The Supposed Contradiction in Begriffsschrift\n for discussion.\n\nThe third section of Begriffsschrift introduces definitions\nof what have become known as the weak and strong ancestrals\nof a relation, and proves a powerful induction theorem based on these\nnotions. A careful examination of this construction is beyond the\nscope of this essay\u2014the reader is encouraged to consult the\nentry on\n Frege\u2019s theorem\n for more details.\n\nThe most important aspect of the third section of\nBegriffsschrift, for our purposes at least, is the new bit of\nnotation that Frege introduces: the definition stroke \u201c\n\n\u201d. The definition stroke occurs initially in a formula of\nthe form: \n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u201c\\(\\Psi\\)\u201d is the\ndefiniendum, and \u201c\\(\\Phi\\)\u201d\nis the definiens.\nAfter giving an example of the definition stroke in action (formula\n69, the notion of \\(F\\) being hereditary in the f-sequence),\nFrege explains the definition stroke in Begriffsschrift as\nfollows:\n\n\nThis sentence is different from those considered previously since\nsymbols occur in it which have not been defined before; it itself\ngives the definition. It does not say, \u201cThe right side of the\nequation has the same content as the left side\u201d; but,\n\u201cThey are to have the same content\u201d. This sentence is\ntherefore not a judgement; and consequently, to use the Kantian\nexpression, also not a synthetic judgement. [\u2026]\n\nAlthough originally (69) is not a judgement, still it is readily\nconverted into one; for once the meaning of the new symbols is\nspecified, it remains fixed from then on; and therefore formula (69)\nholds also as a judgement, but as an analytic one, since we can only\nget out what was put into the new symbols. This dual role of the\nformula is indicated by the doubling of the judgement stroke. (1879a:\n\u00a724) \n\n\nThe use of the notion of sameness of conceptual content (i.e., \u201c\\(\\equiv\\)\u201d)\nin the definitions of\nBegriffsschrift automatically entails that the\ndefiniens and definiendum have the same content\n(that is, denote the same fact or circumstance), whereas the improved\nunderstanding of identity mobilized in Grundgesetze only\nentails, as a matter of logic, that the definiendum and\ndefiniens denote the same object. Hence, in his informal\nexplications Frege explicitly stipulates that within\nGrundgesetze definitions the expressions occurring on both\nsides of the identity symbol have not only the same reference but also\nthe same sense.\n3. The Logic of Grundgesetze\n\nThe reader who is interested in the evolution of Frege\u2019s logical\nideas between the writing of Begriffsschrift and the writing\nof Grundgesetze should consult the short supplementary essay\n The Period Between Begriffsschrift and Grundgesetze.\n Here, we will jump directly into the formal system contained in the\nlatter work.\n\nOne of the main, and most obvious, differences between the logic of\nBegriffsschrift and the logic of Grundgesetze, other\nthan the addition of value-ranges, is the fact that Frege now has a\nfully worked out, rigorous type theory in place. The most fundamental\ndistinction is that between objects, which are saturated, and\nfunctions (including concepts as a special case), which are not, and\nthus require being \u201ccompleted\u201d via application to one or\nmore arguments.\n\nTwo particularly important types of function are concepts and\nrelations. A concept is a unary function such that, for any\nargument (of the appropriate type), the value of the function applied\nto that argument is a truth-value. A relation is a function\nwith two (or more) arguments such that, for any pair (or\nn-tuple) of arguments (again, of the appropriate type), the\nvalue of the function applied to that pair is a truth-value (Frege\n1893/1903: \u00a74, see also 1893/1903: \u00a722).\n\nFrege also subdivides functions in terms of the kinds of\nargument that they take. Thus, a function is a first-level\nfunction if and only if it takes an object or objects (and hence\nonly takes an object or objects) as argument(s); a function is a\nsecond-level function if and only if it takes a first-level\nfunction or functions (and hence only takes a first-level function or\nfunctions) as argument(s); and a function is a third-level\nfunction if and only if it takes a second-level function or\nfunctions (and hence only takes a second-level function or functions)\nas argument(s) (Frege 1893/1903: \u00a721 through \u00a723, see also\n\u00a726).\n\nIn what follows we will divide up our discussion of the logic of\nGrundgesetze into three sections, where the first considers\nthose notations that occur in the earlier logic of\nBegriffsschrift (although often with rather different\nunderstandings), the second presents those notations that are novel to\nthe logic of Grundgesetze, and the third presents the axioms\n(now called Basic Laws) and rules of inference of the logic of\nGrundgesetze.\n3.1 The \u201cOld\u201d Operators of Grundgesetze\n3.1.1 The Judgement Stroke\n\nAs was the case in Begriffsschrift, the judgement stroke of\nGrundgesetze transforms expressions into judgements. Unlike\nthe earlier system, however, in the logic of Grundgesetze the\njudgement stroke does not attach to expressions that name facts or\ncircumstances, but instead attaches to expressions that name objects\n(that is, proper names):\n\n\nAbove it is already stated that within a mere equation no assertion is\nyet to be found; with \u201c\\(2 + 3 =\n5\\)\u201d only a truth-value is designated, without its being\nsaid which one of the two it is. Moreover, if I wrote \u201c\\((2\n+ 3 = 5) = (2 = 2)\\)\u201d and\npresupposed that one knows that \\(2 = 2\\) is the True, even then I\nwould not thereby have asserted that the sum of 2 and 3 is 5; rather I\nwould only have designated the truth-value of: that \u201c\\(2\n+ 3 = 5\\)\u201d refers to the same as\n\u201c\\(2 = 2\\)\u201d. We are therefore in\nneed of another special sign in order to be able to assert something\nas true. To this end, I let the sign\n\nprecede the name of the truth value, in such a way that, e.g., in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nit is asserted that the square of 2 is 4. I distinguish the\njudgement from the thought in such a way that that I\nunderstand by a judgement the acknowledgement of the truth of\na thought. (Frege 1893/1903: \u00a75) \n\n\nThus, the application of the judgement stroke to a\nGrundgesetze expression lacking the judgement stroke asserts\nthat the expression in question is a name of the True, where the\nTrue is the object denoted by true sentences (and the\nFalse is the object denoted by false sentences). An expression of\nthe form: \n\n\n\n\n\nnow no longer says that \u201c\\(\\Phi\\) is a fact\u201d, but instead\nsays something like \u201c\\(\\Phi\\) is (i.e., is identical to) the\nTrue\u201d. It is worth noting that this simple account of the\njudgement stroke will be complicated somewhat in our discussion of\nFrege\u2019s new Grundgesetze understanding of Roman\nletters.\n\nIn Grundgesetze Frege once again suggests that the judgement\nstroke proper (1893/1903: \u00a75), as well as the negation stroke\n(1893/1903: \u00a76), the conditional stroke (1893/1903: \u00a712),\nand the concavity (1893/1903: \u00a78), can be understood as\nconsisting merely of the actual vertical \u201cstroke\u201d or line\n(or curve with variable, in the case of the concavity), with the\nattached horizontal portion(s) of the notation understood as separate\noccurrences of the horizontal. In actual practice within\nGrundgesetze the judgement stroke never appears without the\nattached horizontal. Unlike in the Begriffsschrift, however,\nthe horizontal stroke does occur relatively frequently on its\nown, as an operator distinct from the judgement stroke, the\nconditional stroke, and the negation stroke.\n\nIn the logic of Grundgesetze, the horizontal stroke\nis a unary function symbol that attaches to names of objects, and it\nnames a function that always outputs a truth-value, regardless of the\nkind of object input:\n\n\nI regard it as a function-name such that: \n\n\n\n\n\nis the True when \\(\\Delta\\) is the True, and is the False when\n\\(\\Delta\\) is not the True. Accordingly, \n\n\n\n\n\nis a function whose value is always a truth-value, or a concept\naccording to our stipulation. (1893/1903: \u00a75) \n\n\nIn other words, if the horizontal is prefixed to the name of a\ntruth-value \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d, then\nthe resulting complex name: \n\n\n\n\n\nnames the same truth-value as is named by \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d.\nIf, however, \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\ndoes not name a\ntruth-value, then \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d names the False.\n\nOf particular importance here is the fact that, within the logic of\nGrundgesetze, the horizontal stroke is not limited in its\napplication to judgeable contents: the horizontal stroke can be\nmeaningfully applied to any name whatsoever. As a result of\nFrege\u2019s insistence that all functions be defined on all\narguments of the appropriate type, the function denoted by the\nhorizontal stroke must be defined on all objects. Thus, when applied\nto an object that is not a truth-value, it outputs the False.\n\nAs a result, although Frege requires that the judgement stroke be\nattached to a truth-value name in the explication of the judgement\nstroke quoted above, we can, within the logic of Grundgesetze, achieve\nthe effect of attaching the judgement stroke to any name \\(\\Delta\\)\nwhatsoever by attaching the judgement stroke to \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d, obtaining: \n\n\n\n\n\nIf the horizontal stroke is a part of the judgement stroke, and given\nthat (as will be discussed below) multiple horizontals can be fused\ninto a single horizontal, then the above judgement is equivalent to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor would be, were the latter well-formed. Thus \u201c\n\n\\(2\\)\u201d (or, at least, \u201c\n\n\\((\\)\n\n\\(2)\\)\u201d is a well-formed judgement in the logic of\nGrundgesetze, albeit an incorrect one.\n3.1.2 The Negation Stroke\n\nWithin the logic of Grundgesetze, the negation\nstroke is a unary function symbol that attaches to names of\nobjects\u2014in Frege\u2019s terminology it names a first-level\nconcept. Like the horizontal, the negation stroke transforms any\nproper name into a truth-value name:\n\n\nWe do not need a specific sign to declare a truth-value to be the\nFalse, provided we have a sign by means of which every truth-value is\ntransformed into its opposite, which in any case is indispensable. I\nnow stipulate:\n\nThe value of the function \n\n\n\n\n\nis to be the false for every argument for which the value of the\nfunction \n\n\n\n\n\nis the True, and it is to be the True for all other arguments.\n(1893/1903: \u00a76) \n\n\nThus, if the negation stroke is prefixed to the name of a truth-value\n\u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d, then \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d names the True if \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nnames the False, and\nnames the False if \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nnames the True. If, however, \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\ndoes not name a\ntruth-value, then \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d names the True.\n\nFrege\u2019s treatment of the negation stroke as a total function has\nodd consequences. For example, if \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nis the name of any object\nother than a truth value, then \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d names the True, and hence we have: \n\n\n\n\n\nFrege explicitly notes that \u201c\n\n\\(2\\)\u201d is a correct judgement (1893/1903: \u00a76).\n3.1.3 The Conditional Stroke\n\nWithin the logic of Grundgesetze, Frege\u2019s\nconditional stroke is a binary function symbol that attaches\nto names of objects\u2014in Frege\u2019s terms the conditional\nstroke names a first-level relation:\n\n\nNext, in order to be able to designate subordination of concepts and\nother important relations, I introduce the function with two\narguments: \n\n\n\n\n\nby means of the specification that its value shall be the False if the\nTrue is taken as the \\(\\zeta\\)-argument, while any object that is not\nthe True be taken as the \\(\\xi\\)-argument; that in all other cases the\nvalue of the function shall be the True. (1893/1903: \u00a712) \n\n\nThe conditional stroke is a total function: Given any two proper names\n\u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis a name of the True if either \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nfails to name the True\n(i.e., either names the False or does not name a truth-value), or\n\u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d names the True; and\nit names the False otherwise. Hence, for any name \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nwhatsoever: \n\n\n\n\n\nis a name of the true, and hence: \n\n\n\n\n\nis a correct judgement in the logic of Grundgesetze\n\nFrege calls the lower component of a conditional (what modern readers\nwould term the antecedent) the subcomponent of the\nconditional, and the upper component (what modern readers would call\nthe consequent) the supercomponent. As noted in our\ndiscussion of the logic of Begriffsschrift, however,\nconditional stroke constructions can be parsed into supercomponent and\nsubcomponents(s) in multiple ways. For example, given proper names\n\u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(\\Theta\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(\\Lambda\\)\u201d,\nand \u201c\\(\\Xi\\)\u201d,\nwe can parse the complex\nexpression: \n\n\n\n\n\nas having any of: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor \u201c\\(\\Xi\\)\u201d as supercomponent\n(with one, two, three, or four subcomponents on each reading,\nrespectively). Although Frege introduces the conditional stroke as if\nit is a simple binary first-level function from pairs of objects to\ntruth-values, in his manipulation of the conditional stroke (and\nespecially in the rules of inference for reasoning with the\nconditional stroke) he treats the conditional stroke much more like a\nkind of open-ended n-ary function name that takes a single\nargument as supercomponent, but which can take any (finite) number of\narguments as its subcomponents. Since many of Frege\u2019s rules of\ninference are formulated in terms of adding, eliminating, or\nrepositioning supercomponents and subcomponents, this systematic\nambiguity has profound implications for how proofs are constructed\nwithin Grundgesetze.\n\nThe multiple-subcomponent reading of complex conditional stroke\nconstructions has two consequence worth mentioning at this point.\nFirst, Frege notes that, on the reading of: \n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta\\) and \\(\\Lambda\\) are the two subcomponents, each\nsubcomponent plays exactly the same role as the other\u2014the\n\u201cordering\u201d of subcomponents does not matter (1893/1903:\n\u00a712). Thus, this expression names the same truth-value as: \n\n\n\n\n\nFrege introduces a rule of inference (one that can be applied within\nderivations without comment) that allows arbitrary re-ordering of\nsubcomponents. This rule amounts to a Grundgesetze analogue\nof Axiom 3 from the logic of Begriffsschrift.\n\nAlong similar lines: \n\n\n\n\n\nnames the same truth-value as: \n\n\n\n\n\nFrege introduces a rule of inference that allows one to move from the\nfirst formula to the second, and allows the \u201cfusion\u201d of\nidentical subcomponents generally (which, likewise, can be applied\nwithin derivations without comment). Frege goes on to note that these\nrules of inference generalize to conditional stroke constructions with\nany number of subcomponents.\n3.1.4 Equivalences for the Judgement Stroke\n\nNow that we have considered what we might naturally (although, as we\nhave already noted, rather anachronistically) consider to be the\npropositional fragment of the logic of Grundgesetze, we need\nto return to the horizontal stroke. Frege suggests that the negation\nstroke, the conditional stroke, and the judgement stroke can be\nunderstood as consisting merely of the actual vertical\n\u201cstrokes\u201d or lines involved in their formalization, with\nthe attached horizontal portions of their notation understood as\nseparate occurrences of the horizontal (see (1893/1903: \u00a75,\n\u00a76, and \u00a712). As a result, for any name \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d,\nall of: \n\n\n\n\\(\\Delta\\),\n\n\n(\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)),  \n\n\n(\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)), and \n\n\n(\n\n(\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)))  \n\n\nname the same truth-value (1893/1903: \u00a76), and, for any names\n\u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d,\nall of: \n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n(h)\n\n\n\nname the same truth-value (1893/1903: \u00a712). Frege\u2019s calls\nthese equivalences, and the transformations that result from replacing\none of the expressions above with another, equivalent formulation, the\nfusion of horizontals. Like the permutation of subcomponents\nand the fusing of identical subcomponents, Frege allows one to fuse\n(and \u201cun-fuse\u201d) horizontals within Grundgesetze\nderivations (1893/1903: \u00a748) without comment.\n\nThe careful reader might wonder why Frege chose the particular\nfunctions he in fact chose. Could he not have defined negation so that\n\u201c \n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d named the True\nif \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d was not the name\nof a truth-value? We are now in a position to provide an answer to\nthis question: The fact that the negation stroke and the conditional\nstroke must fuse with the horizontal entails that the particular\ndefinitions of the negation stroke and the conditional stroke provided\nby Frege are the only ones possible, given the way in which he defines\nthe horizontal stroke (Berg & Cook 2017).\n3.1.5 The Equality Sign\n\nWe now arrive at another dramatic difference between the logic of\nBegriffsschrift and the logic of Grundgesetze. Now\nthat he has introduced the sense/reference distinction, Frege can\nexplain the difference in content between \u201c\\(a\n= a\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(a\n= b\\)\u201d (where both are true) in\nterms of a difference in sense. Hence, in the logic of\nGrundgesetze Frege\u2019s equality sign is defined\nas one would expect:\n\n\nWe have already used the equality-sign rather casually to form\nexamples but it is necessary to stipulate something more precise\nregarding it.  \n\\[\\text{\u2018}\\Gamma =\n\\Delta\\text{\u2019}\\]\n\n\nrefers to the True, if \\(\\Gamma\\) is the same as \\(\\Delta\\); in all\nother cases it is to refer to the False. (1893/1903: \u00a77)\n\n\nNote that he has shifted to using the traditional identity symbol\n\u201c\\(=\\)\u201d, rather than the special\nsymbol \u201c\\(\\equiv\\)\u201d that he\nintroduced for sameness of conceptual content in\nBegriffsschrift. A nice overview of the development of\nFrege\u2019s sense/reference distinction, with particular attention\npaid to the role that the distinction plays in the later logic of\nGrundgesetze, can be found in Kremer (2010).\n\nWhile the definition of the equality-sign is now straightforward,\nFrege\u2019s use of it is somewhat different from the way in which\nthe equality symbol is used in modern predicate logic. Frege uses the\nequality-sign when making everyday equality claims such as \u201c\\(2\n+ 2 = 4\\)\u201d, but he also uses the\nsame symbol flanked by truth-value names in order to express the claim\nthat the truth-value names are names of the same\ntruth-value\u2014that is, that the expressions in question are\nequivalent. This explains an apparent oversight in Frege\u2019s\ndiscussion of defined propositional operators. Frege does not\nexplicitly provide a definition of the material biconditional within\nGrundgesetze, although he could have easily defined the\nmaterial biconditional along standard lines as the conjunction of two\nconditionals:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\nare both truth-value\nnames, then this defined notion and the function named by\nFrege\u2019s primitive equality-sign output the same value. If one or\nboth of \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\nare proper names but not\ntruth-value names, however, then the value of the complex material\nconditional applied to these arguments can differ from the value of\nthe equality-sign applied to them. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\nis a name of the True, while \u201c1 = 2\u201d is a name of the\nFalse.\n\nFrege notes that the identity sign, in combination with the\nhorizontal, allows us to construct a function that maps the\ntruth-values to the True, and every other object to the False\n(1893/1903: \u00a75):\n\n\n\n\n\nThis truth-value concept helps us to sort out a technical issue\nrelated to one of the deep differences between the logic of\nBegriffsschrift and the logic of Grundgesetze.\n\nRecall that Frege noted in the preface to Begriffsschrift\nthat he could have added: \n\n\n\n\n\nto the logic, and this principle would have simplified the\npresentation, as it implies both Axiom 5 and Axiom 6. We also noted\nthat this claim is correct with respect to the logic of\nBegriffsschrift, since the quantifiers in question are\nrestricted to judgeable contents. Things stand differently, however,\nwithin the logic of Grundgesetze, since on the\nGrundgesetze interpretation this same formula (with\n\u201csameness\u201d understood purely syntactically, subject to the\nreplacement of \u201c\\(\\equiv\\)\u201d with\n\u201c\\(=\\)\u201d) is false. Let \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nbe the name of any object\nthat is not a truth value. Then \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d is a name of the True, hence \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d is a name of the False, and \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d  do not name the same object. So \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta= \\Delta\\)\u201d is a name of the False.\n\nWe can use the truth-value concept just discussed to construct a\ncorrect judgement within the logic of Grundgesetze that\ncaptures the intuitive import of the principle Frege considered adding\nto Begriffsschrift: \n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, if \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d names\na truth value, then \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nand the double negation of \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nname the same object.\n3.1.6 Two Forms of Universal Quantification\n\nNext up are the quantifiers. In the logic of Grundgesetze,\nunlike (strictly speaking) in the logic of Begriffsschrift,\nFrege mobilizes two distinct forms of universal quantification. The\nfirst of these is the simplest: the concavity. The concavity (with\nassociated German letter) is a unary second-level concept, mapping\nfirst-level functions to truth-values:\n\n\n[\u2026] let: \n\n\n\n\nrefer to the True if the value of the function \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\) is the\nTrue for every argument, and otherwise the False. (Frege 1893/1903:\n\u00a78) \n\n\nFrege includes no restriction that \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\nmust be the name of a\nconcept, hence \u201c\n\n\\(\\mathfrak{a} + 1\\)\u201d is a well-formed judgement within\nthe logic of Grundgesetze, albeit an incorrect one. In fact,\nhe could not have coherently imposed any such restriction, since\nsecond-level functions must be defined for all first-level functions\nin exactly the same manner as first-level functions must be defined\nfor all objects.\n\nIn the logic of Grundgesetze, the concavity, like the\nnegation stroke and the conditional stroke, \u201cfuses\u201d with\nhorizontals. In other words, all of the following name the same\ntruth-value (i.e., are equivalent): \n\n\n\n,  \n\n\n, \n\n\n, and \n\n\n \n\n\nand Frege also allows the fusing or un-fusing of horizontals connected\nto the concavity to be carried out without comment within derivations\n(1893/1903: \u00a78). \n\nFrege explicitly introduces notation for second-order quantification\nvia the concavity, using the the now-familiar method: identifying\nwhich (in this case third-level) function such a quantifier names. If\n\u201c\\(\\mathcal{F}_\\beta\\)\u201d is a\nsecond-level function name (and where the subscripted occurrence of\n\u201c\\(\\beta\\)\u201d binds object-level\noccurrences of \u201c\\(\\beta\\)\u201d that\noccur in the argument to which \u201c\\(\\mathcal{F}_\\beta\\)\u201d\nis applied),\nthen: \n\n\n\n\n\nnames the truth-value of the claim that, for every first-level\nfunction \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\), the result of applying the function named by\n\u201c\\(\\mathcal{F}_\\beta\\)\u201d to\n\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\) is the True (1893/1903: \u00a724). Thus, unlike the\nlogic of Begriffsschrift, the logic of Grundgesetze\ninvolves distinct quantifiers for first- and second-order\nquantification, rather then merely introducing a single quantifier\nthat sometimes ranges over functions and at other times ranges over\nthe arguments of those functions depending on context.\n\nFrege does not introduce notation for third- or higher order\nconcavity-quantification, since from a practical perspective he never\nneeds it: instead, he uses his value-range operator to\n\u201creduce\u201d the level of various constructions within\nGrundgesetze (as described below) so that they are in the\nrange of his first- and second-order concavity.\n\nFinally, we have the definition stroke. As in\nBegriffsschrift, Frege uses the definition stroke\n\u201c\n\n\u201d to indicate when a sentence is a definition:\n\n\nIn order to introduce new signs by means of those already known, we\nnow require the double-stroke of definition which appears as\na double judgement-stroke combined with a horizontal: \n\n\n\n\n\nand which is used instead of the judgement stroke where something is\nto be defined rather than judged. By means of a definition we\nintroduce a new name by determining that it is to have the same sense\nand the same reference as a name composed of already known signs. The\nnew sign thereby becomes co-referential with the explaining sign; the\ndefinition thus immediately turns into a proposition. Accordingly, we\nare allowed to cite a definition just like a proposition replacing the\ndefinition stroke by a judgement stroke. (1893/1903: \u00a727) \n\n\nThere is little difference between this explanation of the definition\nstroke and the one given in Begriffsschrift, but it is worth\nnoting that the judgements of equality entailed by\nGrundgesetze definitions only assert that \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d\nhave the same referent, not\nthat they have the sense. Thus, Frege explicitly stipulates that the\ndefiniens and definiendum of a Grundgesetze\ndefinition have the same sense.\n3.2 The New Operators of Grundgesetze\n3.2.1 A Device for Generality: Roman Letters\n3.2.1.1 The Basics of Roman Letters\n\nWe begin our discussion of the new notions that did not occur within\nthe logic of Begriffsschrift with the second means for\nexpressing generality within Grundgesetze: the Roman\nletter generality device. At first glance, this might be\nsurprising, since Roman letters were used as a device for expressing\ngenerality within Begriffsschrift, as discussed above. But in\nBegriffsschrift they were (officially, at least) merely an\nabbreviation for instances of the concavity that occurred initially in\nthe formula in question. In the logic of Grundgesetze,\nhowever, Roman letters are a completely new, independent device of\ngeneralization.\n\nRestricting our attention to the simplest case, where the lower-case\nRoman letter \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d\n\u201cindicates\u201d (in Frege\u2019s terminology) an object, and\nwhere \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d is any\nfirst-level function name : \n\n\n\n\n\nis a correct Grundgesetze proposition if and only if the\nfunction named by \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\noutputs the True for\nevery possible argument, and it is incorrect otherwise (1893/1903:\n\u00a717).\n\nThe astute reader will have noticed that (following Frege) our\nexplanation of the Roman letter generality device does not follow the\ngeneral pattern utilized in our discussion of the horizontal, negation\nstroke, conditional stroke, or concavity. In short, we have not\nidentified a function to which the expression \u201c\\(\\Phi(x)\\)\u201d\nrefers (where \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d\nis an occurrence of the Roman\nletter generality device), but instead have only explained when\njudgements involving the Roman letter generality device are\ncorrect.\n\nFrege never gives a function-identifying definition of this sort for\nthe Roman letter generality device\u2014that is, he never identifies\na particular second-level function which is denoted by this particular\nlogical device. The reasons for this are simple: Were he to do so, (i)\nit would presumably be the same function as is picked out by instances\nof the concavity of the same \u201corder\u201d; (ii) it would be\napplicable to sub-expressions within a Grundgesetze formula,\nbut it is not; and (iii) it would not have the flexibility of\nscope that it in fact has. As a result, expressions containing\nRoman letters are not names:\n\n\nI shall call names only those signs or combinations of signs\nthat refer to something. Roman letters, and combinations of signs in\nwhich these occur, are thus not names as they merely\nindicate. A combination of signs which contains Roman\nletters, and which always results in a proper name when every Roman\nletter is replaced by a name, I will call a Roman\nobject-marker. In addition, a combination of signs which contains\nRoman letters and which always results in a function-name when every\nRoman letter is replaced by a name, I will call a Roman\nfunction-marker or Roman marker of a function.\n(1893/1903: \u00a717) \n\n\nGiven the fact that the Roman letter generality device seems to be of\na very different character than the other logical notions found in\nGrundgesetze, the reader might wonder (a) why Frege included\nit at all, and (b) how, exactly, we should understand it. The answer\nto the first question is relatively simple, the answer to the second,\nless so. Frege explains the Roman letter generality device as\nfollows:\n\n\nLet us now see how the inference called \u201cBarbara\u201d in logic\nfits in here. From the two propositions:\n\n\n\u201cAll square roots of 1 are fourth roots of 1\u201d\n\n\nand:\n\n\n\u201cAll fourth roots of 1 are eighth roots of 1\u201d\n\n\nwe can infer:\n\n\n\u201cAll square roots of 1 are eighth roots of 1\u201d\n\n\nIf we now write the premises thus: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen we cannot apply our modes of inference; however, we can if we\nwrite the premises as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we have the case of \u00a715. Above we attempted to express\ngenerality in this way using a Roman letter, but abandoned it\nbecause we observed that the scope of generality would not be\nadequately demarcated. We now address this concern by stipulating that\nthe scope of a Roman letter is to include everything\nthat occurs in the proposition apart from the judgement stroke.\nAccordingly, one can never express the negation of a generality by\nmeans of a Roman letter, although we can express the generality of a\nnegation. An ambiguity is thus no longer present. Nevertheless, it is\nclear that the expression of generality with German letters and\nconcavity is not rendered superfluous. Our stipulation regarding the\nscope of a Roman letter is only to demarcate its narrowest\nextent and not its widest. It thus remains permissible to let the\nscope extend to multiple propositions so that the Roman letters are\nsuitable to serve in inferences in which the German letters, with\ntheir strict demarcation of scope, cannot serve. So, when our\npremisses are \n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\nthen in order to make the inference to the conclusion \n\n\n\n\n\nwe temporarily expand the scope of \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d to include both\npremises and conclusion, although each of these propositions holds\neven without this extension. (1893/1903: \u00a717)\n\n\nThere are a number of important things to note about this passage. The\nfirst is that this novel treatment of the Roman letter generality\ndevice (in comparison to the logic of Begriffsschrift) is\nmotivated by exactly the puzzle regarding modus ponens that\nwe raised earlier in this essay. Here the inference in question is a\nversion of hypothetical syllogism (explicated in \u00a715 of\nGrundgesetze, and about which more below), but the issue is\nthe same. The rule in question allows us, for any expressions\n\\(\\Delta\\), \\(\\Gamma\\), and \\(\\Theta\\), to move from: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto: \n\n\n\n\n\nBut if, as was the case in the logic of Begriffsschrift, the\nRoman letter involving formulas: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nare merely abbreviations of: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen we do not, strictly speaking, have an instance of the premises\nfor this rule, and thus cannot advance to the desired (and correct)\nconclusion. Thus, we need an alternative understanding of the Roman\nletter generality device.\n\nFrege suggests that, when we carry out the relevant instance of\nhypothetical syllogism, we temporarily extend the scope of\nthe Roman letter \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d so that\nit includes both premises and the conclusion. As a result, the Roman\nletter \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d\n\u201cindicates\u201d the same object (whatever object this might\nbe) uniformly throughout all three Grundgesetze propositions,\nand we can apply hypothetical syllogism.\n3.2.1.2 Higher Order Quantification and Roman Letters\n\nFrege also allows both second- and third-order quantification to be\nexpressed via the Roman letter generality device. Thus,\nif \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d is the name of\nan object, then: \n\n\n\n\n\nis a correct Grundgesetze proposition if and only if, for any\nfirst-level function \\(f\\), the result of applying \\(f\\) to the object\nnamed by \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d is the\nTrue. Likewise, if \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\zeta)\\)\u201d\nis a first-level\nfunction name, then: \n\n\n\n\n\nis a correct Grundgesetze proposition if and only if, for\nevery second-level function \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), the result of applying\n\\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to the function named by \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\nis the True\n(1893/1903: \u00a725). Although Frege does explicitly provide\ntreatment of third-order quantification via the Roman generality\ndevice (unlike his treatment of the concavity, which is limited to\nfirst- and second-order), he does not provide any notation for fourth-\nor higher-order quantification of either sort.\n3.2.1.3 How Roman Letters Work\n\nWe now move on to the second question: How, exactly, is the Roman\nletter device to work? How are we to understand Frege\u2019s idea\nthat expressions involving the Roman letter generality device\n\u201cindicate\u201d but do not \u201cname\u201d truth-values, and\nhow are we to understand the idea that their scope must contain the\nentirety of the judgement in which they occur (other than, possibly,\nthe judgement stroke), but could be expanded to include more than one\nformula at once? The right way to work out the answers to these\nquestions is a matter of rather substantial controversy. Landini\nsuggests that Frege is gesturing at the idea of variable assignments\n(Landini 2012), an idea that would not be developed fully until Tarski\n(1933); while Heck suggests instead that Frege intended the Roman\nletters to be understood substitutionally in terms of auxiliary names\n(that is, \u201cextra\u201d names not included in the\nobject-language-level vocabulary), where, for example, an expression\nof the form: \n\n\n\n\n\n(or multiple such expressions taken together in inference) indicates\nthe True if and only if \u201c\\(\\Phi(n)\\)\u201d\nis a name of the True,\nno matter what object the auxiliary name \u201c\\(n\\)\u201d\ndenotes (Heck 2012). For a\nmodern version of this kind of treatment of quantifiers, see Mates\n(1972). No attempt will be made here to settle this debate.\n3.2.2 The Value-Range Operator\n\nThe most notorious primitive notion in Grundgesetze is\nFrege\u2019s value-range operator, given its central role in\nRussell\u2019s paradox and the collapse of Frege\u2019s logicist\nproject. The value-range symbol, or \u201csmooth breathing\u201d,\nnames a second-level function from first-level functions to objects.\nGiven any first-level function name \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d,\nthe object named by\nthe application of the unary second-level\n\u201csmooth-breathing\u201d operator to \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d:\n \n\\[\u1f10(\u03a6(\\varepsilon))\\]\n \n\nis the value-range of the function named by \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d.\nUnlike the other\nprimitive function symbols in the logic of Grundgesetze,\nFrege does not give an explicit definition of the function picked out\nby the value-range operator (for good reason, since there is, thanks\nto Cantor\u2019s theorem, no such function!), instead explicating the\nnotion in terms of an informal version of Basic Law V:\n\n\nI use the words:\n\n\n\u201cThe function \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\) has the same value-range as\nthe function \\(\\Psi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\n\n\nalways as co-referential with the words:\n\n\n\u201cthe function \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\) and \\(\\Psi(\\xi)\\) always have the\nsame value for the same argument\u201d.\n\n\n(1893/1903: \u00a73) \n\n\nOne of the most important applications of the value-range operator is\nits application to first-level concepts, and the resulting objects,\nwhich Frege calls extensions, can be thought of, from a\nmodern perspective and loosely speaking, as akin to the graphs of the\ncharacteristic functions of these concepts. Extensions do\n\u201cbehave\u201d logically very similarly to (naive) sets, but the\nsensitive (or merely sensible) reader should be wary of attributing\ntoo much of our own modern views about sets onto Grundgesetze\nextensions. For an in-depth examination of the development of\nFrege\u2019s thought regarding the nature of extensions, see Burge\n(1984).\n\nFrege identifies another sub-class of objects that can be constructed\nusing the value-range operator that do not correspond to anything\nwidely used within modern mathematics: double value-ranges. Given any\nbinary first-level function name \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi,\n\\zeta)\\)\u201d, we form the double value-range of (the\nfunction named by)\u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi, \\zeta)\\)\u201d by applying the\nvalue-range operator to \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi,\n\\zeta)\\)\u201d (binding the argument place marked by \u201c\\(\\xi\\)\u201d),\nobtaining the unary\nfirst-level function name \u201c\\(\u1f10(\\Phi(\\varepsilon,\n\\zeta))\\)\u201d. We now obtain the double value-range of \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi,\n\\zeta)\\)\u201d by applying the\nvalue-range function a second time, to \u201c\\(\u1f10(\\Phi(\\varepsilon,\n\\zeta))\\)\u201d, to obtain \u201c\\(\u1f00\u1f10(\\Phi(\\varepsilon,\n\\alpha))\\)\u201d, which names the double value-range of the\nfunction named by \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi,\n\\zeta)\\)\u201d (1893/1903: \u00a736). \n\nThe need for double value-ranges provides one very practical\nexplanation for the fact that the higher-order quantifiers of\nGrundgesetze range over functions generally rather than\nmerely over concepts and relations as in modern systems. Given a\nbinary relation symbol \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\zeta,\n\\xi)\\)\u201d, the result of the first step\u2014that is, the\nreferent of \u201c\\(\u1f10(\\Phi(\\varepsilon,\n\\xi))\\)\u201d\u2014is not a concept but a function that maps\nobjects to value-ranges. Thus, the introduction of value-ranges\nrequires that Frege accept not just concepts and relations, but\nfunctions more generally, into his higher-order ontology\u2014see\nLandini (2012: ch. 4) for further discussion.\n\nFrege only defines value-ranges for first-level functions. Of course,\nhe could have extended the notion in order to obtain object-level\nanalogues of second- and third-level functions directly. But there is\nno need, since we can \u201creduce\u201d second- and higher-level\nfunctions to first-level functions via repeated applications of the\nvalue-range operator on first-level functions. For example, given a\nsecond-level concept name \u201c\\(\\mathcal{F}_\\beta\\)\u201d\nmapping\nfirst-level functions to truth-values, we can construct an\nobject-level analogue by first constructing the name of the concept\nthat holds of an object if and only if that object is the value-range\nof a first-level function that the concept named by \u201c\\(\\mathcal{F}_\\beta\\)\u201d\nmaps to the\nTrue: \n\n\n\n\n\nThe object-level analogue of the second-level concept named by \u201c\\(\\mathcal{F}_\\beta\\)\u201d\nis then the\nvalue-range of this first-level concept: \n\n\n\n\n\nThis maneuver is quite general. Any time one might, within\nGrundgesetze, desire an object-level analogue of a second- or\nthird-level function, one can use this trick to construct such an\nobject.\n3.2.3 The Backslash Operator for Definite Descriptions\n\nThe final primitive notation of the logic of Grundgesetze is\nthe backslash. The backslash is a unary first-level function\nmapping objects to objects:\n\n\n[\u2026] we can help ourselves by introducing the function: \n    \n\\[\\backslash \\xi\\]\n\n\nwith the specification to distinguish two cases:\n\nif, for the argument, there is an object \\(\\Delta\\) such that\n\\(\u1f10(\\Delta = \\varepsilon)\\) is the argument, then the value of\nthe function \\(\\backslash\\xi\\) is to be \\(\\Delta\\) itself.\nif, for the argument, there is no object \\(\\Delta\\) such that\n\\(\u1f10(\\Delta = \\varepsilon)\\) is the argument, then the argument\nitself is to be the value of the function \\(\\backslash\\xi\\).\n\n\n(1893/1903: \u00a711) \n\n\nA bit of terminology is helpful: Given any proper name \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d,\nlet us call the object\nnamed by \u201c\\(\u1f10(\\Delta =\n\\varepsilon)\\)\u201d the singleton-extension of the\nobject named by \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d.\nThen:\n\n\u201c\\(\\backslash\\Gamma\\)\u201d is co-referential with \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nif \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\nnames the\nsingleton-extension of the object named by \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\n\u201c\\(\\backslash\\Gamma\\)\u201d is co-referential with \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\notherwise.\n\n\nPut even more simply, the backslash is a\n\u201csingleton-stripping\u201d device.\n\nFrege utilizes the backslash as kind of a definite description\noperator. In modern treatments, a definite description operator \u201c\\(\\iota\\)\u201d\nattaches to predicates\nand, given a predicate \u201c\\(\\Phi(x)\\)\u201d,\u201c\\(\\iota\nx(\\Phi(x))\\)\u201d denotes the unique object that satisfies the\npredicate \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d (if\nthere is such). Frege, however, in keeping with the strategy of\nreducing levels via successive applications of the value-range\noperator, defines his definite description operator as applying, not\nto concepts, but rather to their value-ranges. Thus, where \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\nis a concept name\n\u201c\\(\\backslash\\Gamma\\)\u201d denotes\nthe unique object that is mapped to the True by the concept named by\n\u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d, if there is\nsuch, and denotes the object named by \u201c\\(\u1f10(\\Phi(\\varepsilon))\\)\u201d\notherwise.\n3.3 The Axioms of Grundgesetze\n\nA notable difference between the logic of Begriffsschrift and\nthe logic of Grundgesetze is that the former depends on many\naxioms, but very few rules of inference, while the latter depends on\nfewer axioms but more rules. The logic of Grundgesetze\ncontains a mere six axioms, now called Basic Laws, including\nthe completely new axioms required to deal with value ranges and the\nbackslash operator. This is not, however, mere reorganization.\nInstead, in the logic of Grundgesetze Frege replaces a number\nof the axioms found in Begriffsschrift with corresponding\nrules that are much more flexible, and hence much more powerful, in\ntheir application. For an insightful discussion of what the\nGrundgesetze-era Frege takes to be characteristics of a Basic\nLaw (as opposed to any other logical truth derivable from the Basic\nLaws and rules of inference) and their relation to proof, see Pedriali\n(2019).\n3.3.1 Basic Law I\n\nFrege\u2019s Basic Law I looks familiar, since, syntactically at\nleast, it is just\n Axiom 1\n from the logic of Begriffsschrift:\n\n\n\nBasic Law I (1893/1903: \u00a718)\n\n\nIn Grundgesetze Frege justifies Basic Law I as follows:\n\n\nWe will now set up some general laws for Roman letters which we will\nhave to make use of later. According to \u00a712: \n\n\n\n\n\nwould be the False only if \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\Delta\\) were the True\nwhile \\(\\Gamma\\) was not the True. This is impossible; accordingly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1893/1903: \u00a718) \n\n\nGiven the discussion above (and Frege\u2019s careful use of \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\nwas not the True\u201d rather\nthan \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\) was the False\u201d\nin the justification of the Basic Law), it is no surprise that this\nexpression is a name of the True even when the objects named by \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d\nare not truth-values. The\nreader is encouraged to verify, for example, that: \n\n\n\n\n\nis a name of the True. Frege notes that: \n\n\n\n\n\nis a special instance of the formulation of Basic Law I above,\nobtained by replacing \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d\nwith \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d and then fusing\nequal subcomponents (1893/1903: \u00a718). Given its obvious utility,\nFrege lists this as a second version of Basic Law I, one that we can\nuse as a primitive axiom without explicitly deriving it.\n3.3.2 Basic Law II\n\nBasic Law II also looks familiar, as it is the Grundgesetze\nanalogue of Axiom 9 from the logic of Begriffsschrift. Now\nthat Frege has a clear conception of the the hierarchy of object,\nfirst-level function, second-level function, and third-level function\nin place, and now that he has distinct quantifiers that range,\nrespectively, over different \u201clevels\u201d of entity from\nwithin this hierarchy, he is careful to formulate both a\n\u201cfirst-order\u201d version and a \u201csecond-order\u201d\nversion of the Basic Law in question. The first version, Basic Law IIa\nis:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law IIa (1893/1903: \u00a720)\n\n\nFrege describes this Basic Law as expressing the thought that\n\u201cwhat holds of all objects, also holds of any\u201d (1893/1903:\n\u00a720). Basic Law IIa, combined with the generalized version of\nmodus ponens used in Grundgesetze (and discussed\nbelow) provides a means for inferring a Roman letter generality from a\ngenerality formulated using the concavity. Given a concavity\nproposition of the form \u201c\n\n\\(\\Phi(\\mathfrak{a})\\)\u201d, we can invoke an instance of\nBasic Law IIa: \n\n\n\n\n\nand combine these, using modus ponens, to conclude \u201c\n\n\\(\\Phi(a)\\)\u201d. \n\nThe second-order version of Basic Law II is called Basic Law IIb:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law IIb (1893/1903: \u00a725)\n\n\nNote that the occurrence of \u201c\\(\\mathfrak{f}\\)\u201d\nin the\nsubcomponent, and \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d in the\nsupercomponent, are distinct variables (the former is a German letter,\nthe latter a Roman letter).\n3.3.3 Basic Law III\n\nBasic Law III, the Grundgesetze principle governing the\nequality-sign, appears at first glance to be a slight variant of the\nindiscernibility of identicals:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law III (1893/1903: \u00a720)\n\n\nIf we replace the Roman letter \u201c\\(g\\)\u201d\nby the horizontal, and the\napply fusion of horizontals, we do indeed obtain the\nGrundgesetze version of the indiscernibility of identicals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law III is a good bit more powerful than this, however.\n\nBasic Law III states that for any unary first-level function name\n\u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d and any proper\nnames \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d,\nit is not the case that\nthe application of the function named by \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\nto the truth-value\nnamed by \u201c\\(\\Delta = \\Gamma\\)\u201d\nis the True, while application of the function named by \u201c\\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)\u201d\nto the truth-value\nnamed by: \n\n\n\n\n\nis something other than the True. Thus, this axiom amounts to the\nclaim that one can always replace an equality with the corresponding\nuniversally quantified expression anywhere in a proposition (i.e., as\nthe argument of any function \\(\\Phi(\\xi)\\)).\n\nThe negation stroke is, of course, one of the functions that can be\nsubstituted for \u201c\\(g\\)\u201d. Thus,\nthe following is a substitution instance of Basic Law III: \n\n\n\n\n\nwhich (although we have not yet discussed the generalized\ncontraposition rule required) is equivalent to: \n\n\n\n\n\nThus, Basic Law III implies a Grundgesetze analogue of the\nidentity of indiscernibles. As a result, Frege has no need for an\nanalogue of Begriffsschrift\u2019s Axiom 8 within the logic\nof Grundgesetze, since he proves: \n\n\n\n\n\nby first proving: \n\n\n\n\n\nand then applying Basic Law III (and his Grundgesetze version\nof modus ponens). He calls this principle of self-identity\nIIIe (1893/1903: \u00a750).\n3.3.4 Basic Law IV\n\nBasic Law IV is:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law IV (1893/1903: \u00a718)\n\n\nThis principle might appear to be nothing more than a\nGrundgesetze analogue of a familiar principle of classical\npropositional logic:  \n\\[(\\neg (\\Delta\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg \\Gamma)) \\rightarrow (\\Delta \\leftrightarrow\n\\Gamma)\\]\n\n\nAs usual, however, we should be careful not to read this axiom as only\napplying to truth-value names. Instead, instances of Basic Law IV name\nthe True no matter what names are substituted in for \n\u201c\\(a\\)\u201d\nand \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d.\nThus: \n\n\n\n\n\nis a name of the True (recall that both \u201c\n\n\\(2\\)\u201d and \u201c\n\n\\(3\\)\u201d are names of the False, \u201c\n\n\\(3\\)\u201d  names the True, and hence both the supercomponent\nand the subcomponent of this instance of Basic Law IV are names of the\nTrue).\n\nUnlike most of the (non-value-range involving) axioms and rules of the\nlogic of Grundgesetze, Basic Law IV has no direct analogue\nwithin the logic of Begriffsschrift (but see the discussion\nof Axioms 5 and 6 below), and its purpose seem to be, in part, to\nenforce the intended interpretation of the horizontal and negation in\ncases where the arguments are not truth-values. Nevertheless, given\nthat all occurrences of Roman letters within Basic Law IV are prefixed\nby the horizontal, the practical import of this principle is much the\nsame as the classical analogue: Given any two truth-values, if the\nfirst is not equal to the negation of the second, then they are\nthemselves equal.\n\nGiven that Basic Law IV, in effect, forces the logic of\nGrundgesetze to be bivalent, we might wonder what happened to\nthe axioms that played this role in the logic of\nBegriffsschrift\u2014Axioms 5 and 6. Grundgesetze\nanalogues of both Axiom 5 and Axiom 6 are proven very early in the\nderivations of Grundgesetze, but, as was the case with Basic\nLaw II, Frege in fact identifies and proves versions that are much\nmore general. The theorems in question are: \n\n\n\n\n\nIVc\n\n\n\n\n\nIVd\n\n\n\nwhich he calls IVc and IVd respectively (1893/1903: \u00a751).\n3.3.5 Basic Law V\n\nIt is somewhat surprising how little fanfare accompanies Frege\u2019s\nintroduction of the now notorious Basic Law V. Frege merely notes\nthat:\n\n\n[\u2026] a value-range equality can always be converted into the\ngenerality of an equality, and vice versa. (1893/1903:\n\u00a720)\n\n\nand then states the axiom:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law V (1893/1903: \u00a720)\n\n\nThe Grundgesetze formulation of Basic Law V is a good bit\nmore general than well-known modern \u201ctranslations\u201d of this\nlaw within higher-order logic such as:  \n\\[\\forall X\\;\\forall Y(\\S(X) = \\S(Y) \\leftrightarrow \\forall z(X(z)\n\\leftrightarrow Y(z)))\\]\n\n\nwhere the quantifiers range over concepts or properties. The\nGrundgesetze formulation of Basic Law V entails not only that\nevery concept has a corresponding extension, but in addition that any\nfunction whatever (concept or not) has a value-range. Thus, the\nGrundgesetze formulation of Basic Law V also captures\nsomething akin to:  \n\\[\n\\forall f\\;\\forall g(\\S(f) = \\S(g) \\leftrightarrow \\forall z(f(z) = g(z)))\n\\]\n\n\nSince within modern treatments of higher-order logic concepts are a\ndifferent sort from functions, however, rather than being a sub-class\nof the class of functions as in Grundgesetze, Frege\u2019s\nBasic Law V is, strictly speaking, not equivalent to either of these\nmodern formulations.\n3.3.6 Basic Law VI\n\nThe final axiom of Grundgesetze, Basic Law VI, governs the\nbehavior of the backslash:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Law VI (1893/1903: \u00a718)\n\n\nThis axiom makes explicit one part of the informal definition of the\nbackslash operator discussed earlier. If \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\nis a name of the\nsingleton extension of the object named by \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d,\nthen the result of\napplying the backslash to \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\nnames the same object as\ndoes \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d. But Basic Law\nVI tells us nothing regarding what results when we apply the backslash\nto a name that is not the name of a singleton extension. We\nmight wonder why Frege did not add a second axiom governing this case,\nsuch as: \n\n\n\n\n\nThe absence of this principle from the deductive system of\nGrundgesetze leads to a striking insight into Frege\u2019s\nmethodology. The question at issue is whether Frege would have taken\nhis logic to be complete\u2014that is, would he have taken it to\nprove every logical truth expressible in the language of\nGrundgesetze. Michael Dummett suggests that:\n\n\nNo doubt Frege would have claimed his axioms, taken together with the\nadditional informal stipulations not embodied in them, as yielding a\ncomplete theory: to impute to him an awareness of the incompleteness\nof higher-order theories would be an anachronism. (1981: 423)\n\n\nThe stipulations Dummett has in mind are the identification of the\ntruth values with their singleton extensions at the conclusion of the\n\u201cPermutation Argument\u201d in \u00a710 of\nGrundgesetze. What the lack of a second instance of Basic Law\nVI reveals, however, is that Frege would have been quite aware of the\nincompleteness of the logic of Grundgesetze (were it not\ninconsistent), since he has failed to include a principle that is\nclearly true on the intended interpretation. Imputing to him an\nawareness of an obvious gap in the logical principles he actually\nincludes in his logic (given the informal semantic elucidations he\nprovides regarding the intended interpretation of his logic) is far\ndifferent from claiming that he was aware of the in principle\nincompleteness of second-order logic, of course.\n\nInterestingly, Heck points out (2012: ch. 2) that Frege claims later\nin Grundgesetze that a proposition \u201cis, it seems,\nunprovable\u201d (Frege 1893/1903: \u00a7114). Frege is careful to\nclaim only that the principle is unprovable, and hence that he will\nnot claim that is is true (i.e., he will not write it as a\njudgement with \u201c\n\n\u201d, but he also refrains from claiming that it is false.\nHeck suggests that Frege was at this point recognizing the potential\nincompleteness of his system (or, at least, of the consistent\nsub-system relevant to the derivations at issue in \u00a7114). What\nprevents Frege from proving the claim in question, and what allows\nDedekind to prove a similar principle in his own treatment of\narithmetic (Dedekind 1888), is that the latter has an informal version\nof the axiom of choice at his disposal, while Frege has included no\nformal version of choice within the logic of Grundgesetze\n(Heck 2012: ch. 2). This is an important observation, but nothing this\nsophisticated is needed in order to conclude that Frege would likely\nhave thought that his system was incomplete.\n\nFrege had no need for an axiom covering the application of the\nbackslash to non-singleton extensions in his derivation of arithmetic\nwithin the formal system of Grundgesetze (and we can presume\nhe also had no need of it in his envisioned derivation of real and\ncomplex analysis). Thus, he did not need to add it to his stock of\nBasic Laws. Frege\u2019s formal system only needs to include those\nlogical principles that are required for his reconstructions of\narithmetic and analysis\u2014his project did not require a logic that\nwas proof-theoretically complete in the modern sense, and as a result\nwe should not be surprised that the logic he did formulate would have\nappeared (to Frege, to his readers, and to us) to be rather obviously\nincomplete (had Basic Law V not rendered it inconsistent, and hence\ntrivially complete).\n3.4 The Rules of Inference of Grundgesetze\n\nDespite frequent claims that Frege\u2019s logic is unwieldy and\ndifficult to use, the rules of inference that Frege formulates\ndemonstrate the opposite: the resulting system, which takes advantage\nof the systematic ambiguity present in Frege\u2019s way of reading\nconditionals, is in many ways more powerful and more elegant than\nmodern deductive systems.\n\nFirst, we remind the reader of the three rules of inference that have\nalready been discussed, and which can be applied in derivations within\nthe logic of Grundgesetze without any comment or label. These\nare the permutation of subcomponents, the fusion of identical\nsubcomponents, and the fusion of horizontals. In addition to these,\nFrege introduces six rules of inference.\n3.4.1 Generalized Modus Ponens\n\nThe first is Generalized Modus Ponens (the term\n\u201cGeneralized Modus Ponens\u201d is not Frege\u2019s, he calls\nthis inference \u201cInferring(a)\u201d), which Frege describes\nthusly:\n\n\nIf a subcomponent of a proposition differs from a second\nproposition only in lacking the judgement-stroke, then one may infer a\nproposition which results from the first by suppressing that\nsubcomponent. (1893/1903: \u00a714)\n\n\nSimply put, if one has proven a Grundgesetze conditional, and\none has also proven a subcomponent of that conditional, then one may\ninfer the result of deleting that subcomponent from the conditional.\nAssume that we have proven the Grundgesetze proposition: \n\n\n\n\n\nThen, if we also have \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d, then we can conclude: \n\n\n\n\n\nOn this application, we are parsing the conditional in question such\nthat \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d is the\nrelevant subcomponent, and: \n\n\n\n\n\nthe supercomponent. If, on the other hand, we have \u201c\n\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, then we would instead conclude: \n\n\n\n\n\ntreating both \u201c\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d as subcomponents,\nand \u201c\\(\\Theta\\)\u201d as\nsupercomponent. Applications of Generalized Modus Ponens are indicated\nby a solid horizontal line. This is the first instance of a\ntransition sign (1893/1903: \u00a714).\n\nThis rule is an incredibly powerful generalization of the simple\nversion of modus ponens found in Begriffsschrift, or\nincluded in modern deductive systems that use linear notation.\nConsider how many steps would be needed to transition from: \n\n\\[A_1 \\rightarrow (A_2 \\rightarrow (A_3 \\rightarrow\n(A_4 \\rightarrow (A_5 \\rightarrow (A_6 \\rightarrow (A_7 \\rightarrow (A_8\n\\rightarrow B)))))))\\]\n\n\nand \\(A_8\\) to:  \n\\[A_1\n\\rightarrow (A_2 \\rightarrow (A_3 \\rightarrow (A_4 \\rightarrow (A_5\n\\rightarrow (A_6 \\rightarrow (A_7 \\rightarrow B))))))\\]\n\n\nin a typical natural deduction system. Within the logic of\nGrundgesetze, Frege can carry out the analogous deduction in\none step. Similar comments regarding the power of Frege\u2019s rules\nof inference apply to the other rules that take advantage of the fact\nthat Grundgesetze formulas can be parsed into subcomponent(s)\nand supercomponent in more than one way (that is, to Generalized\nHypothetical Syllogism, Generalized Contraposition, and Generalized\nDilemma).\n\nFrege allows for multiple, simultaneous applications of the\ngeneralized form of Generalized Modus Ponens. Thus, if we\nhave proven: \n\n\n\n\n\nand we then prove both \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d, and \u201c\n\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, we may eliminate both subcomponents\nsimultaneously, marking the transition with a double horizontal line\n(1893/1903: \u00a714).\n3.4.2 Generalized Hypothetical Syllogism\n\nThe next rule of inference is Generalized Hypothetical\nSyllogism (This is again novel terminology\u2014Frege calls this\nrule \u201cInferring(b)\u201d):\n\n\nIf the same combination of signs occurs in one proposition as\nsupercomponent and in another as subcomponent, then a proposition may\nbe inferred in which the supercomponent of the latter features as\nsupercomponent and all subcomponents of both, save that mentioned,\nfeature as subcomponents. However, subcomponents that occur in both\nneed only be written once. (1893/1903: \u00a715)\n\n\nThis is a generalized, and more powerful, version of familiar rule\nhypothetical syllogism that takes advantage of the\n\u201cequal\u201d status of subcomponents: Given a\nGrundgesetze proposition, and a second proposition whose\nsupercomponent is a subcomponent of the first, we can infer the\nproposition that results from replacing the relevant subcomponent in\nthe first proposition with the subcomponents of the second\nproposition. For example, if we have derived both of: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen we can combine these to obtain: \n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we have combined the two occurrences of \u201c\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d\ninto a single occurrence.\nApplications of Generalized Hypothetical Syllogism are indicated by\nnew type of transition sign, a dashed horizontal line\n\u201c\u2014\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\u201d, and multiple\nsimultaneous applications of Generalized Hypothetical Syllogism are\nindicated by the double dashed horizontal line \u201c= = = =\u201d.\nGeneralized Hypothetical Syllogism is a much more powerful rule-based\nform of Axiom 2 from the logic of Begriffsschrift.\n3.4.3 Generalized Contraposition\n\nThe third rule of inference is Generalized Contraposition\n(Frege calls this rule merely \u201ccontraposition\u201d).\n\n\nOne may permute a subcomponent with a supercomponent provided one\nsimultaneously reverses the truth-value of each. (1893/1903:\n\u00a715)\n\n\nGeneralized contraposition allows us to \u201cswitch\u201d the\nsupercomponent of a Grundgesetze proposition with\nany subcomponent of it, provided one \u201csimultaneously\nreverses the truth-value of each\u201d. Recalling the fact\nthat Frege describes negation as \u201ca sign by means of which every\ntruth-value is transformed into its opposite\u201d (1893/1903:\n\u00a76), this amounts to either adding a single negation to, or\nremoving a single negation from (if at least one negation is present),\neach of the formulas in question. Thus, if we have derived: \n\n\n\n\n\nthen Generalized Contraposition would allows us to obtain any of the\nfollowing: \n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\nApplications of generalized contraposition are represented using the\ntransition sign \u201c\\(\\Large\n\\times\\)\u201d. Generalized Contraposition is a much more\npowerful rule-based version of Axiom 4 from the logic of\nBegriffsschrift.\n3.4.4 Generalized Dilemma\n\nThe fourth rule of inference is Generalized Dilemma (Frege\ncalls this \u201cInferring(c)\u201d):\n\n\nIf two propositions agree in their supercomponents while a\nsubcomponent of the one differs from a subcomponent of the other only\nby a prefixed negation stroke, then we can infer a proposition in\nwhich the common supercomponent features as supercomponent, and all\nsubcomponents of both propositions with the exception of the two\nmentioned feature as subcomponents. In this, subcomponents which occur\nin both propositions need only be written down once. (1893/1903:\n\u00a716)\n\n\nThus, if we have derived Grundgesetze propositions of the\nform: \n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\nwe can infer: \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Dilemma is indicated by the dot-dashed line \u201c\\(\\cdot\\!-\\!\\cdot\\!-\\!\\cdot\\!-\\!\\cdot\\)\u201d.\n\nGeneralized Dilemma is the only official axiom or rule found in the\nlogic of Grundgesetze, other than those that explicitly\ninvolve value-ranges, that does not have some clear (even if much\nweaker) analogue in the logic of Begriffsschrift, (assuming\nwe count Axioms 5 and 6 as at least very loose analogues of Basic Law\nIV\u2014see above), although an analogue of the rule is of course\nderivable in the earlier system (to put it in contemporary\nterms). After noting, in the Preface to Begriffsschrift, that\nhe has limited himself to as few axioms and rules of inference as\npossible, Frege writes that:\n\n\nThis does not rule out, later, transitions from several\njudgements to a new one, which are possible by this single mode of\ninference only in an indirect way, being converted into direct ones\nfor the sake of abbreviation. In fact, this may be advisable for later\napplications. In this way, then, further modes of inference would\narise. (1879a: Preface)\n\n\nIn the Foreword to Grundgesetze, however, Frege notes a\nrather notable shift in strategy:\n\n\nIn order to attain more flexibility and to avoid excessive length, I\nhave allowed myself tacit use of permutation of subcomponents\n(conditions) and fusion of equal subcomponents, and have not reduced\nthe modes of inference and consequence to a minimum. Anyone acquainted\nwith my little book Begriffsschrift will gather from it how\nhere too one could satisfy the strictest demands, but also that this\nwould result in a considerable increase in extent. (1893/1903:\nForeword)\n\n\nPresumably it is Generalized Dilemma, in particular, that Frege has in\nmind here.\n3.4.5 Concavity Introduction\n\nFrege\u2019s next rule of inference, which we will (following our\ndiscussion of the analogous rule in the logic of\nBegriffsschrift) call Concavity Introduction (Frege\ncall this rule \u201cTransformation of a Roman letter into a German\nletter\u201d), governs the interactions between the two devices for\nexpressing generality within Grundgesetze, the Roman letter\ngenerality device and the concavity:\n\n\nA Roman letter may be replaced whenever it occurs in a proposition\nby one and the same German letter. At the same time, the latter has to\nbe placed above a concavity in front of one such supercomponent\noutside of which the Roman letter does not occur. If in this\nsupercomponent the scope of a German letter is contained and the Roman\nletter occurs within this scope, then the German letter that is to be\nintroduced for the latter must be distinct from the former.\n(1893/1903: \u00a717)\n\n\nMechanically speaking, this is the same rule as the version of\nConcavity Introduction given in the logic of Begriffsschrift.\nThe transition symbol used to label applications of concavity\nintroduction is \u201c\\(\\raise\n1ex{\\underparen{\\hspace{1.5em}}}\\)\u201d.\n3.4.6 Roman Letter Elimination\n\nWhile Concavity Introduction allows us to move from a generality\nexpressed with Roman letters to a generality expressed with the\nconcavity, and Basic Law II (combined with generalized modus\nponens) allows us to move from a generality expressed with the\nconcavity to a generalization expressed with Roman letters, as of yet\nwe have no way to move from a proposition expressing a generality (of\neither sort) to an particular instance (the logic of\nBegriffsschrift contains no names, hence this lack was not a\nshortcoming in that earlier system). Frege rectifies this by\nintroducing what we shall call the Roman Letter Elimination\nrule (Frege calls this rule \u201cCiting Propositions\u201d), which\nhe describes as follows:\n\n\nWhen citing a proposition by its label, we may effect a simple\ninference by uniformly replacing a Roman letter within the proposition\nby the same proper name or the same Roman object-marker.\n\nLikewise, we may replace all occurrences in a proposition of a Roman\nfunction letter \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(g\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(h\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(F\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(G\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(H\\)\u201d\nby the same name or Roman\nmarker of a first-level function with one or two arguments, depending\non whether the Roman letter indicates a function with one or two\narguments.\n\nWhen we cite law (IIb), we may replace both occurrences of\n\u201c\\(M_\\beta\\)\u201d by the same name or Roman marker of a\nsecond-level function with one argument of the second kind.\n(1893/1903: \u00a748) \n\n\nRoman Letter Elimination allows for two sorts of application. The\nfirst, and simplest, involves uniformly replacing a particular Roman\nletter with a proper name. But the Roman letter elimination rule also\nallows us to replace a single Roman letter with a Roman object marker.\nHence, using this rule we can also obtain \u201c\n\n\\(\\Phi(\\)\n\n\\(y)\\)\u201d from \u201c\n\n\\(\\Phi(x)\\)\u201d by replacing the Roman letter \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d\nwith the Roman object marker\n\u201c\n\n\\(y\\)\u201d. Likewise, given a Grundgesetze\nproposition of the form  \u201c\n\n\\(f(\\Delta)\\)\u201d we can infer either \u201c\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)\u201d (by replacing the Roman letter \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d\nwith the function name \u201c\n\n\u201d or \u201c\n\n\\(g(\\)\n\n\\(\\Delta)\\)\u201d (by replacing the Roman letter \u201c\\(f\\)\u201d\nwith the Roman function marker\n\u201c\n\n\\(g\\)\n\n\u201d). One of the most visible and most important\napplications of the Roman letter elimination rule is when introducing\n\u201cinstances\u201d of axioms, since Frege does not require that\nwe write the axiom explicitly. Instead, we can cite any\n\u201cinstance\u201d of the axiom that results from applying the\nRoman letter elimination rule (one or more times) to the axiom\nitself.\n\nThere is no transition symbol for this inference, since it is applied\nwhen a previously derived formula is used as a premise in an\napplication of one of the other rules listed above.\n\nThis concludes our survey of the logical systems found in\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift and Grundgesetze. But\nit is far from the conclusion of Frege\u2019s thinking on logic.\nAlthough Frege eventually abandoned his logicist project, and those\nparts of his logical system that led to the contradiction (Basic Laws\nV and VI, and the notion of value ranges more generally) in light of\nthe Russell paradox, he continued to teach courses on logic for many\nyears. The reader interested in Frege\u2019s later views should\nconsult the supplementary essay\n Frege\u2019s Logic After the Paradox.",
