    "main_text": "Understanding Constructive Empiricism || A Doctrine about Aims\n1.4 A Doctrine about Aims\n\nConstructive empiricism has the look of an epistemological view about\nwhat one should believe\u2014namely, that one should be agnostic\nabout the claims about unobservables that our scientific theories\nmake. But the view is not intended to be read in that way.\nConstructive empiricism is to be understood as a doctrine about what\nthe aim of science is, not a doctrine about what an individual should\nor shouldn\u2019t believe.\n\nTo make this clear, we can, following van Fraassen (1998, 213), make\nthe following terminological distinction:\n\n\nscientific agnostic: someone who believes the science s/he\naccepts to be empirically adequate but does not believe it to be true,\nnor believes it to be false.\n\nscientific gnostic: someone who believes the science s/he\naccepts to be true.\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear, in light of this distinction, that one can be a\nscientific gnostic and a constructive empiricist\u2014one would\nsimply choose to have beliefs that go beyond what science is aiming\nat. There is, of course, a connection between the scientific\nrealist/constructive empiricist dichotomy and the scientific\ngnostic/scientific agnostic dichotomy:\n\n\nScientific realists think that the scientific gnostic truly\nunderstands the character of the scientific enterprise, and that the\nscientific agnostic does not. The constructive empiricist thinks that\nthe scientific gnostic may or may not understand the scientific\nenterprise, but that s/he adopts beliefs going beyond what science\nitself involves or requires for its pursuit. (van Fraassen 1998,\n213\u2013214)\n\n\nA final point to make about aims is that the constructive empiricist\ndistinguishes between the aim of an individual scientist or group of\nscientists (which may be fame, glory, or what have you) and the aim of\nscience itself. The aim of science determines what counts as success\nin the enterprise of science as such (van Fraassen 1980, 8). Because\nconstructive empiricists do not identify the aim of science with\nwhatever goals the majority of scientists may have, they deny that\nconstructive empiricism is a thesis in sociology subject to the kind\nof empirical confirmation or disconfirmation any scientific thesis\nfaces. Instead, constructive empiricism is to be understood as a\nphilosophical description of science that seeks to explain how an\nempiricist can regard the activity of science as consistent with the\nempiricist\u2019s own standards of rational activity. Like the\ninterpretation of any human activity, constructive empiricism is\nconstrained by the \u201ctext\u201d of the scientific activity it\ninterprets. Within those constraints, it succeeds or fails according\nto its ability to provide an interpretation of science that\ncontributes to our understanding of science, making intelligible to us\nvarious elements of its practice. (van Fraassen 1994,\n188\u2013192)\n\nThe success, then, of constructive empiricism as an account of science\ndoes not depend on how science is understood or undertaken by actual\nscientists. Still, one might start to question the empirical adequacy\nof constructive empiricism\u2019s interpretation of science if the account\nwas dramatically at odds with the attitudes and practices of\nactual scientists. Fortunately, then, for the defender of constructive\nempiricism, recent evidence indicates that is not the case. Based on a\nmethodical survey of practicing scientists, Beebe and Dells\u00e9n\n(2020, 359\u2013361) suggest that the attitudes of contemporary scientists\nare largely in line with the constructive empiricist\u2019s views of\ntheory acceptance and science\u2019s aims.\n",
