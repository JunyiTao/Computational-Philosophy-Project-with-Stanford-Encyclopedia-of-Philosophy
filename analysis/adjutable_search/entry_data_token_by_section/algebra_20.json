    "main_text": "Algebraization of mathematics || Algebraic logic\n5.4 Algebraic logic\n\nAlgebraic logic got off to an early start with Boole\u2019s\nintroduction of Boolean algebra in an 1847 pamphlet. The methods of\nmodern algebra began to be applied to Boolean algebra in the 20th\ncentury. Algebraic logic then broadened its interests to first order\nlogic and modal logic. Central algebraic notions in first order logic\nare ultraproducts, elementary equivalence, and elementary and\npseudoelementary varieties. Tarski\u2019s cylindric algebras\nconstitute a particular abstract formulation of first order logic in\nterms of diagonal relations coding equality and substitution relations\nencoding variables. Modal logic as a fragment of first order logic is\nmade algebraic via Boolean modules.\n6. Free Algebras\n\nGiven any system such as integer arithmetic or real arithmetic, we can\nwrite \\(T\\) for the set of all definite terms such as \\(1 + (2/3)\\)\nbuilt from constants and constituting the definite language, and\n\\(T[V]\\) for the larger indefinite language permitting variables drawn\nfrom a set \\(V\\) in place of some of the constant symbols, with terms\nsuch as \\(x + (2/y)\\). When \\(V\\) contains only a single variable\n\\(\u201cx\u201d\\), \\(T[\\{\u201cx\u201d\\}]\\) is usually abbreviated\nto \\(T[\u201cx\u201d]\\) or just \\(T[x\\)] which is usually\nunambiguous. This convention extends to the algebra \\(\\Phi\\) of terms\nof \\(T\\) together with its list of operation symbols viewed as\noperations for combining terms; we write \\(\\Phi[V\\)] and call it the\nterm algebra on \\(V\\). \n\nThis notion of term algebra is a purely syntactic one involving only\nthe operation symbols, constants, and variables of some language. The\nterms \\(2 + 3\\) and \\(3 + 2\\) are distinct; likewise \\(x + y\\) and \\(y\n+ x\\) are distinct terms. As such they can be considered concrete\nterms.\n\nNow in a universe such as the integers certain concrete terms are\nequivalent in the sense that they always evaluate to the same element\nof the universe regardless of the values of their variable, for\nexample \\(x + y\\) and \\(y + x\\). It is convenient to collect\nequivalent concrete terms into equivalence classes each of which is to\nbe thought of as an abstract term.\n\nAs a simple example of abstract terms consider linear polynomials of\nthe form \\(ax + by\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are nonnegative integers,\nfor example \\(7x + 3y\\). The set of all such polynomials includes 0\nand is closed under polynomial addition, an associative and\ncommutative operation. This set together with the operation of\naddition and the zero polynomial therefore constitutes a commutative\nmonoid.\n\nThis monoid is an example of a free algebra, namely the free\ncommutative monoid on two generators \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). What makes it\nfree is that it satisfies no laws other than those of a commutative\nmonoid. It is not however a free monoid because it satisfies the\ncommutative law. The free monoid on two generators \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is\ninstead the set of all finite strings over the two-letter alphabet\n\\(\\{x,y\\}\\).\n\nWhen commutativity is introduced as a law, it identifies the\npreviously distinct strings \\(xy\\) and \\(yx\\) as a single polynomial;\nmore generally any two strings with the same number of \\(x\\)s and\n\\(y\\)s are identified.\n\nFree monoids and free commutative monoids are examples of free\n\\(C\\)-algebras where \\(C\\) is a class of algebras. In these two\nexamples the class \\(C\\) is respectively that of monoids and\ncommutative monoids.\n\nA free \\(C\\)-algebra is an algebra that lives at the frontier of\nsyntax and semantics. On the semantic side it is a member of \\(C\\). On\nthe syntactic side its elements behave like terms subject to the laws\nof \\(C\\), but no other laws expressible with its generators.\nCommutativity \\(xy = yx\\) is expressible with two generators and so a\nfree monoid on two or more generators cannot be commutative, though\nthe free monoid on one generator, namely the set of all finite strings\nover a one-letter alphabet does form a commutative monoid on one\ngenerator.\n\nOn the syntactic side, the free \\(C\\)-algebra \\(B\\) on a set \\(X\\)\narises as a quotient of the term algebra formed from \\(X\\) (viewed as\na set of variables) using the operation symbols and constants common\nto the algebras of \\(C\\). The quotient identifies those terms that\nhave the same value for all algebras \\(A\\) of \\(C\\) and all valuations\nassigning values in \\(A\\) to the variables of \\(X\\). This performs\njust enough identifications to satisfy every law of \\(C\\) (thereby\nmaking this quotient a \\(C\\)-algebra) while still retaining the\nsyntactic essence of the original term algebra in a sense made more\nprecise by the following paragraph.\n\n(Since the concept of a term algebra can seem a little circular in\nplaces, a more detailed account may clarify the concept. Given the\nlanguage of \\(C\\), meaning the operation symbols and constant symbols\ncommon to the algebras of \\(C\\), along with a set \\(X\\) of variables,\nwe first form the underlying set of the algebra, and then interpret\nthe symbols of the language as operations on and values in that set.\nThe set itself consists of the terms built in the usual way from those\nvariables and constant symbols using the operation symbols; in that\nsense these elements are syntactic. But now we change our point of\nview by treating those elements as semantic, and we look to the\nconstant symbols and operation symbols of the language as syntactic\nentities needing to be interpreted in this semantic domain (albeit of\nterms) in order to turn this set of terms into an algebra of terms. We\ninterpret each constant symbol as itself. And we interpret each\n\\(n\\)-ary operation symbol \\(f\\) as the \\(n\\)-ary operation that takes\nany \\(n\\) terms \\(t_1 , \\ldots ,t_n\\) as its \\(n\\) arguments and\nreturns the single term \\(f(t_1 , \\ldots ,t_n)\\). Note that this\ninterpretation of \\(f\\) only returns a term, it does not\nactually build it. All term building was completed when we\nproduced the underlying set of the algebra.)\n\nFrom the semantic side, a \\(C\\)-algebra \\(B\\) together with a subset\n\\(X\\) of \\(B\\) thought of as variables is said to be a free\n\\(C\\)-algebra on \\(X\\), or is freely generated by \\(X\\), when, given\nany \\(C\\)-algebra \\(A\\), any valuation in \\(A\\) of the variables in\n\\(X\\) (that is, any function \\(f: X\\rightarrow A\\)) uniquely extends\nto a homomorphism \\(h: B\\rightarrow A\\). (We say that \\(h:\nB\\rightarrow A\\) extends \\(f: X\\rightarrow A\\) when the restriction of\n\\(h\\) to \\(X\\) is \\(f\\).)\n\nAs a convenient shorthand a free \\(C\\)-algebra on no generators can\nalso be called an initial \\(C\\)-algebra. An initial \\(C\\)-algebra has\nexactly one homomorphism to every \\(C\\)-algebra.\n\nBefore proceeding to the examples it is worthwhile pointing out an\nimportant basic property of free algebras as defined from the semantic\nside.\n\nTwo free algebras \\(B, B'\\) on respective generator sets \\(X, Y\\)\nhaving the same cardinality are isomorphic.\n\nBy way of proof, pick any bijection \\(f: X\\rightarrow Y\\). This, its\ninverse \\(f': Y\\rightarrow X\\), and the two identity functions on\nrespectively \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), form a system of four functions closed\nunder composition. Each of these functions is from a generator set to\nan algebra and therefore has a unique extension to a homomorphism.\nThese four homomorphisms are also closed under composition. The one\nfrom \\(B\\) to itself extends the identity function on \\(X\\) and\ntherefore must be the identity homomorphism on \\(B\\) (since the latter\nexists and its restriction to \\(X\\) is the identity function on\n\\(X)\\). Likewise the homomorphism from \\(G\\) to \\(G\\) is an identity\nfunction. Hence the homomorphisms between \\(B\\) and \\(G\\) compose in\neither order to identities, which makes them isomorphisms. But this is\nwhat it means for \\(B\\) and \\(B'\\) to be isomorphic.\n\nThis fact allows us to say the free algebra on a given set,\nthinking of isomorphic algebras as being \u201cmorally\u201d the\nsame. Were this not the case, our quotient construction would be\nincomplete as it produces a unique free algebra, whereas the above\ndefinition of free algebra allows any algebra isomorphic to that\nproduced by the quotient construction to be considered free. Since all\nfree algebras on \\(X\\) are isomorphic, the quotient construction is as\ngood as any, and is furthermore one way of proving that they exist. It\nalso establishes that the choice of set of variables is irrelevant\nexcept for its cardinality, as intuition would suggest.\n6.1 Free monoids and groups\n\nTake \\(C\\) to be the class of monoids. The term algebra determined by\nthe binary operation symbol and the constant symbol for identity can\nbe viewed as binary trees with variables and copies of the constant\nsymbol at the leaves. Identifying trees according to associativity has\nthe effect of flattening the trees into words that ignore the order in\nwhich the operation was applied (without however reversing the order\nof any arguments). This produces words over the alphabet \\(X\\)\ntogether with the identity. The identity laws then erase the\nidentities, except in the case of a word consisting only of the\nidentity symbol, which we take to be the empty word.\n\nThus the monoid of finite words over an alphabet \\(X\\) is the free\nmonoid on \\(X\\).\n\nAnother representation of the free monoid on \\(n\\) generators is as an\ninfinite tree, every vertex of which has \\(n\\) descendants, one for\neach letter of the alphabet, with each edge labeled by the\ncorresponding letter. Each vertex \\(v\\) represents the word consisting\nof the letters encountered along the path from the root to \\(v\\). The\nconcatenation of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) is the vertex arrived at by taking\nthe subtree whose root is the vertex \\(u\\), noticing that this tree is\nisomorphic to the full tree, and locating \\(v\\) in this subtree as\nthough it were the full tree.\n\nIf we ignore the direction and labels of the edges in this tree we can\nstill identify the root: it is the only vertex with \\(n\\) edges\nincident on it, all other vertices have \\(n+1\\), namely the one\nincoming edge and the \\(n\\) outgoing ones.\n\nThe free commutative monoid on a set is that monoid whose\ngenerators behave like letters just as for free monoids (in particular\nthey are still atoms), but which satisfy the additional law \\(uv =\nvu\\). We make further identifications, e.g. of\n\u201cdog\u201d and \u201cdgo\u201d. Order of letters in a word is\nnow immaterial, all that matters is how many copies there are of each\nletter. This information can be represented as an \\(n\\)-tuple of\nnatural numbers where \\(n\\) is the size of the alphabet. Thus the free\ncommutative monoid on \\(n\\) generators is \\(N^n\\), the algebra of\n\\(n\\)-tuples of natural numbers under addition.\n\nIt can also be obtained from the tree representation of the free\nmonoid by identifying vertices. Consider the case \\(n = 2\\) of two\nletters. Since the identifications do not change word length, all\nidentifications are of vertices at the same depth from the root. We\nperform all identifications simultaneously as follows. At every vertex\n\\(v\\), identify \\(v_{01}\\) and \\(v_{10}\\) and their subtrees. Whereas\nbefore there were \\(2^n\\) vertices at depth \\(n\\), now there are\n\\(n+1\\). Furthermore instead of a tree we have the upper right\nquadrant of the plane, that is, \\(N^2\\), rotated 135 degrees\nclockwise, with every vertex \\(v\\) at the top of a diamond whose other\nvertices are \\(v_0\\) and \\(v_1\\) at the next level down, and the\nidentified pair \\(v_{01} = v_{10}\\) below both.\n\nTo form the free group on \\(n\\) generators, first form the free monoid\non \\(2n\\) generators, with generators organized into complementary\npairs each the inverse of the other, and then delete all adjacent\ncomplementary pairs from all words.\n\nThis view is not particularly insightful. The group counterpart of the\ntree representation does a better job of presenting a free group.\nConsider the free group on \\(n = 2\\) generators \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). We\nstart with the free monoid on 4 generators \\(A, B, a, b\\) where \\(a\\)\nis the inverse of \\(A\\) and \\(b\\) that of \\(B\\). Every vertex of this\ntree has 4 descendants. So the root has degree 4 and the remaining\nvertices have degree 5: every vertex except the root has one edge\ngoing in, say the generator \\(a\\), and four out. Consider any nonroot\nvertex \\(v\\). The effect of deleting adjacent complementary pairs is\nto identify the immediate ancestor of \\(v\\) with one of the four\ndescendants of \\(v\\), namely the one that makes the path from the\nancestor to the descendant a complementary pair. For every nonroot\nvertex \\(v\\) these identifications reduce the degree of \\(v\\) from 5\nto 4. The root remains at degree 4.\n\nSo now we have an infinite graph every vertex of which has degree 4.\nUnlike the tree for the free monoid on 2 generators, where the root is\ntopologically different from the other vertices, the tree for the free\ngroup on 2 generators is entirely homogeneous. Thus if we throw away\nthe vertex labels and rely only on the edge labels to navigate, any\nvertex can be taken as the identity of the group.\n\nThis homogeneity remains the case for the free abelian group on 2\ngenerators, whose vertices are still of degree 4. However the\nadditional identifications turns it from a tree (a graph with no\ncycles) to a grid whose vertices are the lattice points of the plane.\nThat is, the free abelian group on 2 generators is \\(Z^2\\), and on\n\\(n\\) generators \\(Z^n\\). The edges are the line segments joining\nadjacent lattice points.\n6.2 Free rings\n\nWith no generators the free monoid, free group, and free ring are all\nthe one-element algebra consisting of just the additive identity 0. A\nring with identity means having a multiplicative identity, that is, a\nword \\(\\varepsilon\\). But this makes \\(\\varepsilon\\) a generator for\nthe additive group of the ring, and the free abelian group on one\ngenerator is the integers. So the free ring with identity on no\ngenerators is the integers under addition and now multiplication.\n\nThe free ring on one generator \\(x\\) must include \\(x^2 , x^3\\), etc.\nby multiplication, but these can be added and subtracted resulting in\npolynomials such as \\(7x^3 -3x^2 +2x\\) but without a constant term,\nwith the exception of 0 itself. The distributivity law for rings means\nthat a term such as \\((7x+x^2 )(2x^3 +x)\\) can be expanded as \\(7x^2\n+x^3 +14x^4 +2x^5\\). It should now be clear that these are just\nordinary polynomials with no constant term; in particular we are\nmissing the zero-degree polynomial 1 and so this ring has no\nmultiplicative identity. However it is a commutative ring even though\nwe did not specify this. The free ring with identity on one generator\nintroduces 1 as the multiplicative identity and becomes the ordinary\none-variable polynomials since now we can form all the integers. Just\nas with monoids, the free ring with identity on two generators is not\ncommutative, the polynomials \\(xy\\) and \\(yx\\) being distinct. The\nfree commutative ring with identity on two generators however\nconsists of the ordinary two-variable polynomials over the\nintegers.\n6.3 Free combinatorial structures\n\nFrom the examples so far one might conclude that all free algebras on\none or more generators are infinite. This is by no means always the\ncase; as counterexamples we may point to a number of classes: sets,\npointed sets, bipointed sets, graphs, undirected graphs, Boolean\nalgebras, distributive lattices, etc. Each of these forms a locally\nfinite variety as defined earlier.\n\nA pointed set is an algebra with one constant, say \\(c\\). The free\npointed set on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) has three elements, \\(x, y\\), and\n\\(c\\). A bipointed set is an algebra with two constants \\(c\\) and\n\\(d\\), and the free bipointed set on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) then has four\nelements, \\(x, y, c\\), and \\(d\\).\n\nGraphs, of the oriented kind arising in say automata theory where\nmultiple edges may connect the same two vertices, can be organized as\nalgebras having two unary operations \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) satisfying\n\\(s(s(x)) = t(s(x)) = s(x)\\) and \\(t(t(x)) = s(t(x)) = t(x)\\). The\nfree graph on one generator \\(x\\) has three elements, \\(x, s(x)\\), and\n\\(t(x)\\), constituting respectively an edge and its two endpoints or\nvertices. In this framework the vertices are the elements\nsatisfying \\(s(x) = x\\) (and hence \\(t(x) = x\\) since \\(x = s(x) =\nt(s(x)) = t(x)\\)); all other elements constitute edges. The free graph\non \\(n\\) generators consists of \\(n\\) such edges, all independent.\nOther graphs arise by identifying elements. There is no point\nidentifying an edge with either another edge or a vertex since that\nsimply absorbs the first edge into the second entity. This leaves only\nvertices; identifying two vertices yields a single vertex common to\ntwo edges, or to the same edge in the identification \\(s(x) = t(x)\\)\ncreating a self-loop.\n\nThe term \u201coriented\u201d is to be preferred to\n\u201cdirected\u201d because a directed graph as understood in\ncombinatorics is an oriented graph with the additional property that\nif \\(s(x) = s(y)\\) and \\(t(x) = t(y)\\) then \\(x = y\\); that is, only\none edge is permitted between two vertices in a given direction.\n\nUnoriented graphs are defined as for graphs with an additional unary\noperation \\(g\\) satisfying \\(g(g(x)) = x\\) and \\(s(g(x)) = t(x)\\)\n(whence \\(s(x) = s(g(g(x))) = t(g(x)))\\). The free undirected graph on\n\\(x\\) consists of \\(x, s(x), t(x)\\), and \\(g(x)\\), with the pair \\(x,\ng(x)\\) constituting the two one-way lanes of a two-lane highway\nbetween \\(s(x) = t(g(x))\\) and \\(t(x) = s(g(x)\\)). Identification of\nelements of undirected graphs works as for their oriented\ncounterparts: it is only worth identifying vertices. However there is\none interesting twist here: vertices can be of two kinds, those\nsatisfying \\(x = g(x)\\) and those not. The latter kind of vertex is\nnow asymmetric: one direction of the bidirectional edge is identified\nwith its vertices while the other one forms an oriented loop in the\nsense that its other direction is a vertex. This phenomenon does not\narise for undirected graphs defined as those satisfying \u201cif\n\\(s(x) = s(y)\\) and \\(t(x) = t(y)\\) then \\(x = y\\).\u201d\n6.4 Free logical structures\n\nBoolean algebras are traditionally defined axiomatically as\ncomplemented distributive lattices, which has the benefit of showing\nthat they form a variety, and furthermore a finitely axiomatizable\none. However Boolean algebras are so fundamental in their own right\nthat, rather than go to the trouble of defining lattice, distributive,\nand complemented just for this purpose, it is easier as well as more\ninsightful to obtain them from the initial Boolean algebra. It\nsuffices to define this as the two-element set \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\), the\nconstants (zeroary operations) 0 and 1, and the \\(2^{2^2} = 16\\)\nbinary operations. A Boolean algebra is then any algebra with those 16\noperations and two constants satisfying the equations satisfied by the\ninitial Boolean algebra.\n\nAn almost-definitive property of the class of Boolean algebras is that\ntheir polynomials in the initial Boolean algebra are all the\noperations on that algebra. The catch is that the inconsistent class\nconsisting of only the one-element or inconsistent algebra also has\nthis property. This class is easily ruled out however by adding that\nBoolean algebra is consistent. But just barely\u2014adding any new\nequation to Boolean algebra (without introducing new operations)\naxiomatizes the inconsistent algebra.\n\nSheffer has shown that the constants and the 16 operations can be\ngenerated as polynomials in just one constant, which can be 0 or 1,\nand one binary operation, which can be NAND, \\(\\neg(x\\wedge y)\\), or\nNOR, \\(\\neg(x\\vee y)\\). Any such sufficient set is called a\nbasis. Along the same lines Stone has shown that conjunction,\nexclusive-or, and the constant 1 form a basis. The significance of\nStone\u2019s basis over Sheffer\u2019s is that Boolean algebras\norganized with those operations satisfy all the axioms for a\ncommutative ring with identity with conjunction as multiplication and\nexclusive-or as addition, as well as the law \\(x^2 = 1\\). Any ring\nsatisfying this last condition is called a Boolean ring.\nBoolean rings are equivalent to Boolean algebras in the sense that\nthey have the same polynomials.\n\nAn atom of a Boolean algebra is an element \\(x\\) such that for all\n\\(y, x\\wedge y\\) is either \\(x\\) or 0. An atomless Boolean algebra is\none with no atoms.\n\nThere is exactly one Boolean algebra of cardinality every finite power\nof 2, and it is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of a power set\n\\(2^X\\) of that cardinality under the set operations of union,\nintersection, and complement relative to \\(X\\). Hence all finite\nBoolean algebras have cardinality a power of 2. This situation changes\nwith infinite Boolean algebras; in particular countable Boolean\nalgebras exist. One such is the free Boolean algebra on countably many\ngenerators, which is the only countable atomless Boolean algebra. The\nfinite and cofinite (complement of a finite set) subsets of the set\n\\(N\\) of natural numbers form a subalgebra of the powerset Boolean\nalgebra \\(2^N\\) not isomorphic to the free Boolean algebra, but it has\natoms, namely the singleton sets.\n\nThe free Boolean algebra \\(F(n)\\) on \\(n\\) generators consists of all\n\\(2^2 n\\) \\(n\\)-ary operations on the two-element Boolean algebra.\nBoolean algebras therefore form a locally finite variety.\n\nThe equational theory of distributive lattices is obtained from that\nof Boolean algebras by selecting as its operations just the monotone\nbinary operations on the two-element algebra, omitting the constants.\nThese are the operations with the property that if either argument is\nchanged from 0 to 1, the result does not change from 1 to 0. A\ndistributive lattice is any model of those Boolean equations between\nterms built solely with monotone binary operations. Hence every\nBoolean algebra is a distributive lattice.\n\nDistributive lattices can be arbitrarily \u201cthin.\u201d At the\nextreme, any chain (linear or total order, \\(e.g\\). the reals\nstandardly ordered) under the usual operations of max and min forms a\ndistributive lattice. Since we have omitted the constants this\nincludes the empty lattice, which we have not excluded here as an\nalgebra. (Some authors disallow the empty set as an algebra but this\nproscription spoils many good theorems without gaining any useful\nones.) Hence there exist distributive lattices of every possible\ncardinality.\n\nEvery finite-dimensional vector space is free, being generated by any\nchoice of basis. This extends to infinite-dimensional vector spaces\nprovided we accept the Axiom of Choice. Vector spaces over a finite\nfield therefore form a locally finite variety when scalar\nmultiplication is organized as one unary operation for each field\nelement.\n6.5 Free algebras categorially\n\nWe now consider how free algebras are organized from the perspective\nof category theory. We defined the free algebra \\(B\\) generated by a\nsubset \\(X\\) of \\(B\\) as having the property that for every algebra\n\\(A\\) and every valuation \\(f: X\\rightarrow A\\), there exists a unique\nhomomorphism \\(h: B\\rightarrow A\\). Now every homomorphism \\(h:\nB\\rightarrow A\\) necessarily arises in this way, since its restriction\nto \\(X\\), as a function from \\(X\\) to \\(A\\), is a valuation.\nFurthermore every function \\(f: X\\rightarrow A\\) arises as the\nrestriction to \\(X\\) of its extension to a homomorphism. Hence we have\na bijection between the functions from \\(X\\) to \\(A\\) and the\nhomomorphisms from \\(B\\) to \\(A\\).\n\nNow the typing here is a little casual, so let us clean it up. Since\n\\(X\\) is a set while \\(A\\) is an algebra, \\(f\\) is better typed as\n\\(f: X\\rightarrow U(A)\\) where \\(U(A)\\) denotes the underlying set of\n\\(A\\). And the relationship of \\(X\\) to \\(B\\) is better understood\nwith the notation \\(B = F(X)\\) denoting the free algebra generated by\nthe set \\(X\\). So \\(U\\) maps algebras to sets while \\(F\\) maps sets to\nalgebras. \\(F\\) and \\(U\\) are not in general inverses of each other,\nbut they are nonetheless related in a way we now make precise.\n\nFor any category \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), the notation \\(\\mathbf{C}(A, B)\\) is\ngenerally used to denote the set of all morphisms from object \\(A\\) to\nobject \\(B\\) in category \\(\\mathbf{C}\\). And the set of all functions\nfrom the set \\(X\\) to the set \\(Y\\) can be understood as the\nparticular case \\(\\mathbf{Set}(X, Y)\\) of this convention where\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is taken to be the class \\(\\mathbf{Set}\\) of all sets,\nwhich we can think of as discrete algebras, that is, algebras\nwith no structure. A class of algebras along with a specified set of\nhomomorphisms between any two of its members is an instance of a\ncategory. The members of the class are called the\nobjects of the category while the homomorphisms are called\nthe morphisms.\n\nThe bijection we have just observed can now be stated as\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{C}(F(X), A) \\cong \\mathbf{Set}(X, U(A)) \\]\n\n\nSuch a bijection is called an adjunction between\n\\(\\mathbf{Set}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{C}\\). Here \\(F: \\mathbf{Set}\\rightarrow\n\\mathbf{C}\\) and \\(U: \\mathbf{C}\\rightarrow \\mathbf{Set}\\) are\nrespectively the left and right adjoints of this adjunction;\nwe say that \\(F\\) is left adjoint to (or of) \\(U\\) and \\(U\\) right\nadjoint to \\(F\\).\n\nWe have only described how \\(F\\) maps sets to algebras, and \\(U\\) maps\nalgebras to sets. However \\(F\\) also maps functions to homomorphisms,\nmapping each function \\(f\\) to its unique extension as a homomorphism,\nwhile \\(U\\) maps homomorphisms to functions, namely the homomorphism\nitself as a function. Such maps between categories are instances of\nfunctors.\n\nIn general a category \\(C\\) consists of objects \\(a, b, c\\) and\nmorphisms \\(f: a\\rightarrow b\\), together with an associative\ncomposition law for \u201ccomposable\u201d morphisms \\(f:\nb\\rightarrow c\\), \\(g: a\\rightarrow b\\) yielding the morphism \\(fg:\na\\rightarrow c\\). Furthermore every object a has an identity element\n\\(1_a : a\\rightarrow a\\) which whenever composable with a morphism\n\\(f\\) (on one side or the other) composes with it to yield \\(f\\). A\nfunctor \\(F: C\\rightarrow D\\) maps objects of \\(C\\) to objects of\n\\(D\\) and morphisms of \\(C\\) to morphisms of \\(D\\), such that \\(F(fg)\n= F(f)F(g)\\) and \\(F(1_a) = 1_{F(a)}\\). That is, functors are\n\u201chomomorphisms of categories,\u201d preserving composition and\nidentities.\n\nWith no further qualification such a category is considered an\nabstract category. The categories we have been working with\nare concrete in the sense that they come with a given\nunderlying set or forgetful functor \\(U: C\\rightarrow\\)Set.\nThat is, algebras are based on sets, homomorphisms are certain\nfunctions between these sets, and \\(U\\) simply \u201cforgets\u201d\nthe algebraic structure. Such forgetful functors are faithful\nin the sense that for any two morphisms \\(f, g: a\\rightarrow b\\) of\n\\(C\\), if \\(U(f) = U(g)\\) then \\(f = g,\\) i.e. \\(U\\) does not identify\ndistinct homomorphisms. In general a concrete category is defined as a\ncategory \\(C\\) together with a faithful forgetful functor \\(U:\nC\\rightarrow \\textrm{Set}\\).\n\nCategories themselves admit a further generalization to 2-categories\nas algebras over two-dimensional graphs, with associative composition\nof 1-cells generalized to the 2-associative pasting of 2-cells. A\nfurther simplification of the free-algebra machinery then obtains,\nnamely via abstract adjunctions as the natural 2-dimensional\ncounterpart of isomorphisms in a category, which in turn is the\nnatural 1-dimensional counterpart of equality of elements in a set,\nthe 0-dimensional idea that two points can turn out to be one. This\nleads to a notion of abstract monad as simply the composition of an\nadjoint pair of 1-cells, one of which is the 1-cell abstracting the\nfunctor \\(F\\) that manufactures the free algebra \\(F(V)\\) from \\(V\\).\nOrdinary or concrete monads arise as the composition of functors as\nconcrete 1-cells of a 2-category of categories.",
