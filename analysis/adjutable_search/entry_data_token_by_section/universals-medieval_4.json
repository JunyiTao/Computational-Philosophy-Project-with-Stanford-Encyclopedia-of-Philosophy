    "main_text": "Platonic Forms as Divine Ideas\n5. Platonic Forms as Divine Ideas\n\nBesides Boethius, the most important mediator between the Neo-Platonic\nphilosophical tradition and the Christianity of the Medieval Latin\nWest, pointing out also its theological implications, was St.\nAugustine. In a passage often quoted by medieval authors in their\ndiscussions of divine ideas, he writes as follows:\n\n\n\u2026 in Latin we can call the Ideas \u201cforms\u201d or\n\u201cspecies\u201d, in order to appear to translate word for word.\nBut if we call them \u201creasons\u201d, we depart to be sure from a\nproper translation \u2014 for reasons are called \u201clogoi\u201d\nin Greek, not Ideas \u2014 but nevertheless, whoever wants to use\nthis word will not be in conflict with the fact. For Ideas are certain\nprincipal, stable and immutable forms or reasons of things. They are\nnot themselves formed, and hence they are eternal and always stand in\nthe same relations, and they are contained in the divine\nunderstanding. [Spade 1985, Other Internet Resources, p.\n 383][15]\n\n\nAs we could see from Boethius\u2019 solution, in this way, if\nPlatonic Forms are not universal beings existing in a universal\nmanner, but their universality is due to a universal manner of\nunderstanding, we can avoid the contradictions arising from the\n\u201cna\u00efve\u201d Platonic conception. Nevertheless, placing\nuniversal ideas in the divine mind as the archetypes of creation, this\nconception can still do justice to the Platonic intuition that what\naccounts for the necessary, universal features of the ephemeral\nparticulars of the visible world is the presence of some universal\nexemplars in the source of their being. It is precisely in virtue of\nhaving some insight into these exemplars themselves that we can have\nthe basis of universal knowledge Plato was looking for. As St.\nAugustine continues:\n\n\nAnd although they neither arise nor perish, nevertheless everything\nthat is able to arise and perish, and everything that does arise and\nperish, is said to be formed in accordance with them. Now it is denied\nthat the soul can look upon them, unless it is a rational one, [and\neven then it can do so] only by that part of itself by which it\nsurpasses [other things] \u2014 that is, by its mind and reason, as\nif by a certain \u201cface\u201d, or by an inner and intelligible\n\u201ceye\u201d. To be sure, not each and every rational soul in\nitself, but [only] the one that is holy and pure, that [is the one\nthat] is claimed to be fit for such a vision, that is, the one that\nkeeps that very eye, by which these things are seen, healthy and pure\nand fair and like the things it means to see. What devout man imbued\nwith true religion, even though he is not yet able to see these\nthings, nevertheless dares to deny, or for that matter fails to\nprofess, that all things that exist, that is, whatever things are\ncontained in their own genus with a certain nature of their own, so\nthat that they might exist, are begotten by God their author, and that\nby that same author everything that lives is alive, and that the\nentire safe preservation and the very order of things, by which\nchanging things repeat their temporal courses according to a fixed\nregimen, are held together and governed by the laws of a supreme God?\nIf this is established and granted, who dares to say that God has set\nup all things in an irrational manner? Now if it is not correct to say\nor believe this, it remains that all things are set up by reason, and\na man not by the same reason as a horse \u2014 for that is absurd to\nsuppose. Therefore, single things are created with their own reasons.\nBut where are we to think these reasons exist, if not in the mind of\nthe creator? For he did not look outside himself, to anything placed\n[there], in order to set up what he set up. To think that is\nsacrilege. But if these reasons of all things to be created and\n[already] created are contained in the divine mind, and [if] there\ncannot be anything in the divine mind that is not eternal and\nunchangeable, and [if] Plato calls these principal reasons of things\n\u201cIdeas\u201d, [then] not only are there Ideas but they are\ntrue, because they are eternal and [always] stay the same way, and\n[are] unchangeable. And whatever exists comes to exist, however it\nexists, by participation in them. But among the things set up by God,\nthe rational soul surpasses all [others], and is closest to God when\nit is pure. And to the extent that it clings to God in charity, to\nthat extent, drenched in a certain way and lit up by that intelligible\nlight, it discerns these reasons, not by bodily eyes but by that\nprincipal [part] of it by which it surpasses [everything else], that\nis, by its intelligence. By this vision it becomes most blessed. These\nreasons, as was said, whether it is right to call them Ideas or forms\nor species or reasons, many are permitted to call [them] whatever they\nwant, but [only] to a very few [is it permitted] to see what is true.\n[Spade 1985, Other Internet Resources, pp. 383\u2013384]\n\n\nAugustine\u2019s conception, then, saves Plato\u2019s original\nintuitions, yet without their inconsistencies, while it also combines\nhis philosophical insights with Christianity. But, as a rule, a really\nintriguing solution of a philosophical problem usually gives rise to a\nnumber of further problems. This solution of the original problem with\nPlato\u2019s Forms is no exception.\n5.1 Divine Ideas and Divine Simplicity\n\nFirst of all, it generates a particular ontological/theological\nproblem concerning the relationship between God and His Ideas. For\naccording to the traditional philosophical conception of divine\nperfection, God\u2019s perfection demands that He is absolutely\nsimple, without any composition of any sort of\n parts.[16]\n So, God and the divine mind are not related to one another as a man\nand his mind, namely as a substance to one of its several powers, but\nwhatever powers God has He is. Furthermore, the\nDivine Ideas themselves cannot be regarded as being somehow the\neternal products of the divine mind distinct from the divine mind, and\nthus from God Himself, for the only eternal being is God, and\neverything else is His creature. Now, since the Ideas are not\ncreatures, but the archetypes of creatures in God\u2019s mind, they\ncannot be distinct from God. However, as is clear from the passage\nabove, there are several Ideas, and there is only one God. So how can\nthese several Ideas possibly be one and the same God?\n\nAugustine never explicitly raised the problem, but for example\nAquinas, who (among others) did, provided the following rather\nintuitive solution for it (ST1, q. 15, a. 2). The Divine Ideas are in\nthe Divine Mind as its objects, i.e., as the things understood. But\nthe diversity of the objects of an act of understanding need not\ndiversify the act itself (as when understanding the Pythagorean\ntheorem, we understand both squares and triangles). Therefore, it is\npossible for the self-thinking divine essence to understand itself in\na single act of understanding so perfectly that this act of\nunderstanding not only understands the divine essence as it is in\nitself, but also in respect of all possible ways in which it can be\nimperfectly participated by any finite creature. The cognition of the\ndiversity of these diverse ways of participation accounts for the\nplurality of divine ideas. But since all these diverse ways are\nunderstood in a single eternal act of understanding, which is nothing\nbut the act of divine being, and which in turn is again the divine\nessence itself, the multiplicity of ideas does not entail any\ncorresponding multiplicity of the divine essence. To be sure, this\nsolution may still give rise to the further questions as to what these\ndiverse ways are, exactly how they are related to the divine essence,\nand how their diversity is compatible with the unity and simplicity of\nthe ultimate object of divine thought, namely, divine essence itself.\nIn fact, these are questions that were raised and discussed in detail\nby authors such as Henry of Ghent (c. 1217\u20131293), Thomas of\nSutton (ca. 1250\u20131315), Duns Scotus (c. 1266\u20131308) and\n others.[17]\n5.2 Illuminationism vs. Abstractionism\n\nAnother major issue connected to the doctrine of divine ideas, as\nshould also be clear from the previously quoted passage, was the\nbundle of epistemological questions involved in Augustine\u2019s\ndoctrine of divine illumination. The doctrine \u2014 according to\nwhich the human soul, especially \u201cone that is holy and\npure\u201d, obtains a specific supernatural aid in its acts of\nunderstanding, by gaining a direct insight into the Divine Ideas\nthemselves \u2014 received philosophical support in terms of a\ntypically Platonic argument in Augustine\u2019s De Libero\n Arbitrio.[18]\n The argument can be reconstructed as follows.\n\nThe Augustinian Argument for Illumination.\n\n\nI can come to know from experience only something that can be\nfound in experience [self-evident]\nAbsolute unity cannot be found in experience [assumed]\nTherefore, I cannot come to know absolute unity from experience.\n[1,2]\nWhatever I know, but I cannot come to know from experience, I came\nto know from a source that is not in this world of experiences.\n[self-evident]\nI know absolute unity. [assumed]\nTherefore, I came to know absolute unity from a source that is not\nin this world of experiences. [3,4,5]\n\n\nProof of 2. Whatever can be found in experience is some\nmaterial being, extended in space, and so it has to have a multitude\nof spatially distinct parts. Therefore, it is many in respect of those\nparts. But what is many in some respect is not one in that respect,\nand what is not one in some respect is not absolutely one. Therefore,\nnothing can be found in experience that is absolutely one, that is,\nnothing in experience is an absolute unity.\n\nProof of 5. I know that whatever is given in experience has\nmany parts (even if I may not be able to discern those parts by my\nsenses), and so I know that it is not an absolute unity. But I can\nhave this knowledge only if I know absolute unity, namely, something\nthat is not many in any respect, not even in respect of its parts,\nfor, in general, I can know that something is F in a certain respect,\nand not an F in some other respect, only if I know what it is for\nsomething to be an F without any qualification. (For example, I know\nthat the two halves of a body, taken together, are not absolutely two,\nfor taken one by one, they are not absolutely one, since they are also\ndivisible into two halves, etc. But I can know this only because I\nknow that for obtaining absolutely two things [and not just two\nmultitudes of further things], I would have to have two things that in\nthemselves are absolutely one.) Therefore, I know absolute unity.\n\n\nIt is important to notice here that this argument (crucially) assumes\nthat the intellect is passive in acquiring its concepts. According to\nthis assumption, the intellect merely receives the cognition of its\nobjects as it finds them. By contrast, on the Aristotelian conception,\nthe human mind actively processes the information it receives from\nexperience through the senses. So by means of its faculty\nappropriately called the active or agent intellect, it is able to\nproduce from a limited number of experiences a universal concept\nequally representing all possible particulars falling under that\nconcept. In his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De Anima\nAquinas insightfully remarks:\n\n\nThe reason why Aristotle came to postulate an active intellect was his\nrejection of Plato\u2019s theory that the essences of sensible things\nexisted apart from matter, in a state of actual intelligibility. For\nPlato there was clearly no need to posit an active intellect. But\nAristotle, who regarded the essences of sensible things as existing in\nmatter with only a potential intelligibility, had to invoke some\nabstractive principle in the mind itself to render these essences\nactually intelligible. [In De Anima, bk. 3, lc. 10]\n\n\nOn the basis of these and similar considerations, therefore, one may\nconstruct a rather plausible Aristotelian counterargument, which is\ndesigned to show that we need not necessarily gain our concept of\nabsolute unity from a supernatural source, for it is possible for us\nto obtain it from experience by means of the active intellect. Of\ncourse, similar considerations should apply to other concepts as\nwell.\n\nAn Aristotelian-Thomistic counterargument from\nabstraction.\n\n\nI know from experience everything whose concept my active\nintellect is able to abstract from experience. [self-evident]\nBut my active intellect is able to abstract from experience the\nconcept of unity, since we all experience each singular thing as being\none, distinct from another. [self-evident, common\n experience][19]\nTherefore, I know unity from experience by abstraction. [1,2]\nWhenever I know something from experience by abstraction, I know\nboth the thing whose concept is abstracted and its limiting conditions\nfrom which its concept is abstracted. [self-evident]\nTherefore, I know both unity and its limiting conditions from\nwhich its concept is abstracted. [3,4]\nBut whenever I know something and its limiting conditions, and I\ncan conceive of it without its limiting conditions (and this is\nprecisely what happens in abstraction), I can conceive of its\nabsolute, unlimited realization. [self-evident]\nTherefore, I can conceive of the absolute, unlimited realization\nof unity, based on the concept of unity I acquired from experience by\nabstraction. [5,6]\nTherefore, it is not necessary for me to have a preliminary\nknowledge of absolute unity before all experience, from a source other\nthan this world of experiences. [7]\n\n\n\nTo be sure, we should notice here that this argument does\nnot falsify the doctrine of illumination.\nProvided it works, it only invalidates the\nAugustinian-Platonic argument for illumination. Furthermore,\nthis is obviously not a sweeping, knock-down refutation of the idea\nthat at least some of our concepts perhaps could not so simply be\nderived from experience by abstraction; in fact, in the particular\ncase of unity, and in general, in connection with our transcendental\nnotions (i.e., notions that apply in each Aristotelian category, so\nthey transcend the limits of each one of them, such as the\nnotions of being, unity, goodness,\ntruth, etc.), even the otherwise consistently Aristotelian\nAquinas would have a more complicated story to tell (see Klima 2000b).\nNevertheless, although Aquinas would still leave some room for\nillumination in his epistemology, he would provide for illumination an\nentirely naturalistic interpretation, as far as the acquisition of our\nintellectual concepts of material things is concerned, by simply\nidentifying it with the \u201cintellectual light in us\u201d, that\nis, the active intellect, which enables us to acquire these concepts\nfrom experience by\n abstraction.[20]\n Duns Scotus, who opposed Aquinas on so many other points, takes\nbasically the same stance on this issue. Other medieval theologians,\nespecially such prominent \u201cAugustinians\u201d as Bonaventure,\nMatthew of Aquasparta, or Henry of Ghent, would provide greater room\nfor illumination in the form of a direct, specific, supernatural\ninfluence needed for human intellectual cognition in this life besides\nthe general divine cooperation needed for the workings of our natural\npowers, in particular, the abstractive function of the active\n intellect.[21]\n But they would not regard illumination as supplanting, but rather as\nsupplementing intellectual abstraction.\n\nAs we could see, Augustine makes recognition of truth dependent on\ndivine illumination, a sort of irradiation of the intelligible light\nof divine ideas, which is accessible only to the few who are\n\u201choly and pure\u201d.\n\nBut this seems to go against at least\n\n\n1. the experience that there are knowledgeable non-believers or\npagans\n\n2. the Aristotelian insight that we can have infallible comprehension\nof the first principles of scientific demonstrations for which we only\nneed the intellectual concepts that we can acquire naturally, from\nexperience by\n abstraction,[22]\n\n\nand\n\n\n3. the philosophical-theological consideration that if human reason,\nman\u2019s natural faculty for acquiring truth were not sufficient\nfor performing its natural function, then human nature would be\nnaturally defective in its noblest part, precisely in which it was\ncreated after the image of God.\n\n\nIn fact, these are only some of the problems explicitly raised and\nconsidered by medieval Augustinians, which prompted their ever more\nrefined accounts of the role of illumination in human cognition.\n\nFor example, Matthew of Aquasparta, recapitulating St. Bonaventure,\nwrites as follows:\n\n\nPlato and his followers stated that the entire essence of cognition\ncomes forth from the archetypal or intelligible world, and from the\nideal reasons; and they stated that the eternal light contributes to\ncertain cognition in its evidentness as the entire and sole reason for\ncognition, as Augustine in many places recites, in particular in bk.\nviii. c. 7 of The City of God: \u2018The light of minds for\nthe cognition of everything is God himself, who created\neverything\u2019.\n\nBut this position is entirely mistaken. For although it appears to\nsecure the way of wisdom, it destroys the way of knowledge.\nFurthermore, if that light were the entire and sole reason for\ncognition, then the cognition of things in the Word would not differ\nfrom their cognition in their proper kind, neither would the cognition\nof reason differ from the cognition of revelation, nor philosophical\ncognition from prophetic cognition, nor cognition by nature from\ncognition by grace.\n\nThe other position was apparently that of Aristotle, who claimed that\nthe entire essence of cognition is caused and comes from below,\nthrough the senses, memory, and experience, [working together] with\nthe natural light of our active intellect, which abstracts the species\nfrom phantasms and makes them actually understood. And for this reason\nhe did not claim that the eternal is light necessary for cognition,\nindeed, he never spoke about it. And this opinion of his is obvious in\nbk. 2 of the Posterior Analytics. [\u2026]\n\nBut this position seems to be very deficient. For although it builds\nthe way of knowledge, it totally destroys the way of wisdom.\n[\u2026]\n\nTherefore, I take it that one should maintain an intermediate position\nwithout prejudice, by stating that our cognition is caused both from\nbelow and from above, from external things as well as the ideal\nreasons.\n\n[\u2026] God has provided our mind with some intellectual light, by\nmeans of which it would abstract the species of objects from the\nsensibles, by purifying them and extracting their quiddities, which\nare the per se objects of the intellect. [\u2026] But this light is\nnot sufficient, for it is defective, and is mixed with obscurity,\nunless it is joined and connected to the eternal light, which is the\nperfect and sufficient reason for cognition, and the intellect attains\nand somehow touches it by its upper part.\n\nHowever the intellect attains that light or those eternal reasons as\nthe reason for cognition not as sole reason, for then, as has been\nsaid, cognition in the Word would not differ from cognition in proper\nkind, nor the cognition of wisdom would differ from the cognition of\nknowledge. Nor does it attain them as the entire reason, for then it\nwould not need the species and similitudes of things; but this is\nfalse, for the Philosopher says, and experience teaches, that if\nsomeone loses a sense, then he loses that knowledge of things which\ncomes from that sense. [DHCR, pp. 94\u201396]\n\n\nIn this way, taking the intermediate position between Platonism and\nAristotelianism pure and simple, Matthew interprets Augustine\u2019s\nPlatonism as being compatible with the Aristotelian view, crediting\nthe Aristotelian position with accounting for the specific empirical\ncontent of our intellectual concepts, while crediting the Platonic\nview with accounting for their certainty in grasping the natures of\nthings. Still, it may not appear quite clear exactly what the\ncontribution of the eternal light is, indeed, whether it is necessary\nat all. After all, if by abstraction we manage to gain those\nintellectual concepts that represent the natures of things, what else\nis needed to have a grasp of those natures?\n\nHenry of Ghent, in his detailed account of the issue, provides an\ninteresting answer to this question. Henry first distinguishes\ncognition of a true thing from the cognition of the truth of the\nthing. Since any really existing thing is truly what it is (even if it\nmay on occasion appear something else), any cognition of any really\nexisting thing is the cognition of a true thing. But cognition of a\ntrue thing may occur without the cognition of its truth, since the\nlatter is the cognition that the thing adequately corresponds to its\nexemplar in the human or divine mind. For example, if I draw a circle,\nwhen a cat sees it, then it sees the real true thing as it is\npresented to it. Yet the cat is simply unable to judge whether it is a\ntrue circle in the sense that it really is what it is supposed to be,\nnamely, a locus of points equidistant from a given point. By contrast,\na human being is able to judge the truth of this thing, insofar as he\nor she would be able to tell that my drawing is not really and truly a\ncircle, but is at best a good approximation of what a true circle\nwould be.\n\nNow, in intellectual cognition, just as in the sensory cognition of\nthings, when the intellect simply apprehends a true thing, then it\nstill does not have to judge the truth of the thing, even though it\nmay have a true apprehension, adequately representing the thing. But\nthe cognition of the truth of the thing only occurs in a judgment,\nwhen the intellect judges the adequacy of the thing to its\nexemplar.\n\nBut since a thing can be compared to two sorts of exemplar, namely, to\nthe exemplar in the human mind, and to the exemplar in the divine\nmind, the cognition of the truth of a thing is twofold, relative to\nthese two exemplars. The exemplar of the human mind, according to\nHenry, is nothing but the Aristotelian abstract concept of the thing,\nwhereby the thing is simply apprehended in a universal manner, and\nhence its truth is judged relative to this concept, when the intellect\njudges that the thing in question falls under this concept or not. As\nHenry writes:\n\n\n[\u2026] attending to the exemplar gained from the thing as the\nreason for its cognition in the cognizer, the truth of the thing can\nindeed be recognized, by forming a concept of the thing that conforms\nto that exemplar; and it is in this way that Aristotle asserted that\nman gains knowledge and cognition of the truth from purely natural\nsources about changeable natural things, and that this exemplar is\nacquired from things by means of the senses, as from the first\nprinciple of art and science. [\u2026] So, by means of the universal\nnotion in us that we have acquired from the several species of animals\nwe are able to realize concerning any thing that comes our way whether\nit is an animal or not, and by means of the specific notion of donkey\nwe realize concerning any thing that comes our way whether it is a\ndonkey or not. [HQO, a. 1, q. 2, fol. 5 E-F]\n\n\nBut this sort of cognition of the truth of a thing, although it is\nintellectual, universal cognition, is far from being the infallible\nknowledge we are seeking. As Henry argues further:\n\n\nBut by this sort of acquired exemplar in us we do not have the\nentirely certain and infallible cognition of truth. Indeed, this is\nentirely impossible for three reasons, the first of which is taken\nfrom the thing from which this exemplar is abstracted, the second from\nthe soul, in which this exemplar is received, and the third from the\nexemplar itself that is received in the soul about the thing.\n\nThe first reason is that this exemplar, since it is abstracted from\nchangeable things, has to share in the nature of changeability.\nTherefore, since physical things are more changeable than mathematical\nobjects, this is why the Philosopher claimed that we have a greater\ncertainty of knowledge about mathematical objects than about physical\nthings by means of their universal species. And this is why Augustine,\ndiscussing this cause of the uncertainty of the knowledge of natural\nthings in q. 9 of his Eighty-Three Different Questions, says\nthat from the bodily senses one should not expect the pure truth\n[syncera veritas]\n\n\u2026 The second reason is that the human soul, since it is\nchangeable and susceptible to error, cannot be rectified to save it\nfrom swerving into error by anything that is just as changeable as\nitself, or even more; therefore, any exemplar that it receives from\nnatural things is necessarily just as changeable as itself, or even\nmore, since it is of an inferior nature, whence it cannot rectify the\nsoul so that it would persist in the infallible truth.\n\n\u2026 The third reason is that this sort of exemplar, since it is\nthe intention and species of the sensible thing abstracted from the\nphantasm, is similar to the false as well as to the true [thing], so\nthat on its account these cannot be distinguished. For it is by means\nof the same images of sensible things that in dreams and madness we\njudge these images to be the things, and in sane awareness we judge\nthe things themselves. But the pure truth can only be perceived by\ndiscerning it from falsehood. Therefore, by means of such an exemplar\nit is impossible to have certain knowledge, and certain cognition of\nthe truth. And so if we are to have certain knowledge of the truth,\nthen we have to turn our mind away from the senses and sensible\nthings, and from every intention, no matter how universal and\nabstracted from sensible things, to the unchangeable truth existing\nabove the mind [\u2026]. [ibid., fol. 5. F]\n\n\nSo, Henry first distinguished between the cognition of a true thing\nand the intellectual cognition of the truth of a thing, and then,\nconcerning the cognition of the truth of the thing, he distinguished\nbetween the cognition of truth by means of a concept abstracted from\nthe thing and \u201cthe pure truth\u201d [veritas syncera vel\nliquida], which he says cannot be obtained by means of such\nabstracted concepts.\n\nBut then the question naturally arises: what is this \u201cpure\ntruth\u201d, and how can it be obtained, if at all? Since cognition\nof the pure truth involves comparison of objects not to their acquired\nexemplar in the human mind, but to their eternal exemplar in the\ndivine mind, in the ideal case it would consist in some sort of direct\ninsight into the divine ideas, enabling the person who has this access\nto see everything in its true form, as \u201cGod meant it to\nbe\u201d, and also see how it fails to live up to its idea due to its\ndefects. So, it would be like the direct intuition of two objects, one\nsensible, another intelligible, on the basis of which one could also\nimmediately judge how closely the former approaches the latter. But\nthis sort of direct intuition of the divine ideas is only the share of\nangels and the souls of the blessed in beatific vision; it is\ngenerally not granted in this life, except in rare, miraculous cases,\nin rapture, or prophetic vision.\n\nTherefore, if there is to be any non-miraculous recognition of this\npure truth in this life, then it has to occur differently. Henry\nargues that even if we do not have a direct intuition of divine ideas\nas the objects cognized (whereby their particulars are recognized as\nmore or less approximating them), we do have the cognition of the\nquiddities of things as the objects cognized by reason of some\nindirect cognition of their ideas. The reason for this, Henry says, is\nthe following:\n\n\n\u2026for our concept to be true by the pure truth, the soul,\ninsofar as it is informed by it, has to be similar to the truth of the\nthing outside, since truth is a certain adequacy of the thing and the\nintellect. And so, as Augustine says in bk. 2 of On Free Choice of\nthe Will, since the soul by itself is liable to slip from truth\ninto falsity, whence by itself it is not informed by the truth of any\nthing, although it can be informed by it, but nothing can inform\nitself, for nothing can give what it does not have; therefore, it is\nnecessary that it be informed of the pure truth of a thing by\nsomething else. But this cannot be done by the exemplar received from\nthe thing itself, as has been shown earlier [in the previously quoted\npassage \u2014 GK]. It is necessary, therefore, that it be informed\nby the exemplar of the unchangeable truth, as Augustine intends in the\nsame place. And this is why he says in On True Religion that\njust as by its truth are true those that are true, so too by its\nsimilitude are similar those that are similar. It is necessary,\ntherefore, that the unchangeable truth impress itself into our\nconcept, and that it transform our concept to its own character, and\nthat in this way it inform our mind with the expressed truth of the\nthing by the same similitude that the thing itself has in the first\ntruth. [HQO a. 1, q. 2, fol. 7, I]\n\n\nSo, when we have the cognition of the pure truth of a thing, then we\ncannot have it in terms of the concept acquired from the thing, yet,\nsince we cannot have it from a direct intuition of the divine exemplar\neither, the way we can have it is that the acquired concept primarily\nimpressed on our mind will be further clarified, but no longer by a\nsimilarity of the thing, but by the similarity of the divine exemplar\nitself. Henry\u2019s point seems to be that given that the external\nthing itself is already just a (more or less defective) copy of the\nexemplar, the (more or less defective) copy of this copy can only be\nimproved by means of the original exemplar, just as a copy of a poor\nrepro of some original picture can only be improved by retouching the\ncopy not on the basis of the poor repro, but on the basis of the\noriginal. But since the external thing is fashioned after its divine\nidea, the \u201cretouching\u201d of the concept in terms of the\noriginal idea does yield a better representation of the thing; indeed,\nso much better that on the basis of this \u201cretouched\u201d\nconcept we are even able to judge just how well the thing realizes its\nkind.\n\nFor example, when I simply have the initial simple concept of circle\nabstracted from circular objects I have seen, that concept is good\nenough for me to tell circular objects apart from non-circular ones.\nBut with this simple, unanalyzed concept in mind, I may still not be\nable to say what a true circle is supposed to be, and accordingly,\nexactly how and to what extent the more or less circular objects I see\nfail or meet this standard. However, when I come to understand that a\ncircle is a locus of points equidistant from a given point, I will\nrealize by means of a clear and distinct concept what it was that I\noriginally conceived in a vague and confused manner in my original\nconcept of\n circle.[23]\n\nTo be sure, I do not come to this definition of circle by looking up\nto the heaven of Ideas; in fact, I may just be instructed about it by\nmy geometry teacher. But what is not given to me by my geometry\nteacher is the understanding of the fact that what is expressed by the\ndefinition is indeed what I originally rather vaguely conceived by my\nconcept abstracted from visible circles. This \u201cflash\u201d of\nunderstanding, when I realize that it is necessary for anything that\ntruly matches the concept of a circle to be such as described in the\ndefinition, would be an instance of receiving illumination without any\nparticular, miraculous\n revelation.[24]\n\nHowever, even if in this light Henry\u2019s distinctions between the\ntwo kinds of truths and the corresponding differences of concepts make\ngood sense, and even if we accept that the concepts primarily accepted\nfrom sensible objects need to be further worked on in order to provide\nus with true, clear understanding of the natures of things, it is not\nclear that this further work cannot be done by the natural faculties\nof our mind, assuming only the general influence of God in sustaining\nits natural operations, but without performing any direct and specific\n\u201cretouching\u201d of our concepts \u201cfrom above\u201d.\nUsing our previous analogy of the acquired concept as the copy of a\npoor repro of an original, we may say that if we have a number of\ndifferent poor, fuzzy repros that are defective in a number of\ndifferent ways, then in a long and complex process of collating them,\nwe might still be able discern the underlying pattern of the original,\nand thus produce a copy that is actually closer to the original than\nany of the direct repros, without ever being allowed a glimpse of the\noriginal.\n\nIn fact, this was precisely the way Aristotelian theologians, such as\nAquinas, interpreted Augustine\u2019 conception of illumination,\nreducing God\u2019s role to providing us with the intelligible light\nnot by directly operating on any of our concepts in particular, but\nproviding the mind with \u201ca certain likeness of the uncreated\nlight, obtained through participation\u201d (ST1, q. 84, a. 5c),\nnamely, the agent intellect.\n\nMatthew of Aquasparta quite faithfully describes this view,\nassociating it with the Aristotelian position he rejects:\n\n\nSome people engaged in \u201cphilosophizing\u201d [quidam\nphilosophantes] follow this position, although not entirely, when\nthey assert that that light is the general cause of certain cognition,\nbut is not attained, and its special influence is not necessary in\nnatural cognition; but the light of the agent intellect is sufficient\ntogether with the species and similitudes of things abstracted and\nreceived from the things; for otherwise the operation of [our] nature\nwould be rendered vacuous, our intellect would understand only by\ncoincidence, and our cognition would not be natural, but supernatural.\nAnd what Augustine says, namely, that everything is seen in and\nthrough that light, is not to be understood as if the intellect would\nsomehow attain that light, nor as if that light would have some\nspecific influence on it, but in such a way that the eternal God\nnaturally endowed us with intellectual light, in which we naturally\ncognize and see all cognizable things that are within the scope of\nreason. [DHCR, p. 95]\n\n\nAlthough Matthew vehemently rejects this position as going against\nAugustine\u2019s original intention (\u201cwhich is unacceptable,\nsince he is a prominent teacher, whom catholic teachers and especially\ntheologians ought to follow\u201d \u2014 as Matthew says), this\nview, in ever more refined versions, gained more and more ground\ntoward the end of the 13th century, adopted not only by Aquinas and\nhis followers, but also by his major opponents, namely, Scotus and his\n followers.[25]\n\nStill, illuminationism and abstractionism were never treated by\nmedieval thinkers as mutually exclusive alternatives. They rather\nserved as the two poles of a balancing act in judging the respective\nroles of nature and direct divine intervention in human intellectual\n cognition.[26]\n\nAlthough Platonism definitely survived throughout the Middle Ages (and\nbeyond), in the guise of the interconnected doctrines of divine ideas,\nparticipation, and illumination, there was a quite general\nAristotelian\n consensus,[27]\n especially after Abelard\u2019s time, that the mundane universals of\nthe species and genera of material beings exist as such in the\nhuman mind, as a result of the mind\u2019s abstracting from\ntheir individuating conditions. But consensus concerning this much by\nno means entailed a unanimous agreement on exactly what the universals\nthus abstracted are, what it is for them to exist in the mind, how\nthey are related to their particulars, what their real foundation in\nthose particulars is, what their role is in the constitution of our\nuniversal knowledge, and how they contribute to the encoding and\ncommunication of this knowledge in the various human languages. For\nalthough the general Aristotelian stance towards universals\nsuccessfully handles the inconsistencies quite obviously generated by\na na\u00efve Platonist ontology, it gives rise precisely to these\nfurther problems of its own.\n",
