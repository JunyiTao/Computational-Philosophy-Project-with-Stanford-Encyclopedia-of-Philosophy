    "main_text": "The affective component of faith\n2. The affective component of faith\n\nOne component of faith is a certain kind of affective psychological\nstate\u2014namely, having a feeling of assurance or trust. Some\nphilosophers hold that faith is to be identified simply with such a\nstate: see, for example, Clegg (1979, 229) who suggests that this may\nhave been Wittgenstein\u2019s understanding. Faith in this\nsense\u2014as one\u2019s overall \u2018default\u2019 affective\nattitude on life\u2014provides a valuable foundation for flourishing:\nits loss is recognised as the psychic calamity of \u2018losing\none\u2019s faith\u2019. But if foundational existential assurance is\nto feature in a model of faith of the kind exemplified by theists,\nmore needs to be added about the kind of assurance involved. The\nassurance of theistic faith is essentially a kind of confidence: it is\nessentially faith in God. In general, faith of the kind\nexemplified by theistic faith must have some intentional\nobject. It may thus be argued that an adequate model of this kind\nof faith cannot reduce to something purely affective: some\nbroadly cognitive component is also required. (For an account\nthat takes faith to be fundamentally affective, while allowing that it\nmight also involve cognitive aspects, see Kvanvig 2013.)\n",
