Moral Psychology\n\nAs noted above, Hartley believed that all people will ultimately\nbecome \u201cpartakers of the divine nature.\u201d Such is the\n\u201ceverlasting gospel\u201d of universal salvation. Moreover,\nHartley sought to show that the gathering together of all humanity\ninto the \u201cmystical body of Christ\u201d is a process inherent\nin our nature: the psychological dynamic of association, which\ngenerates our ideas and perfects our secondarily automatic movements,\nalso \u201chas a tendency to reduce the state of those who have eaten\nof the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, back again to a\nparadisiacal one\u201d (OM 1, prop. 14). The question is,\nhow does association accomplish this?\n\nTo see how it does, we must look (1) more closely at the concept of\nassociation, (2) at Hartley\u2019s notion of\n\u201ctransference,\u201d and (3) at the series of psychological\norientations association and transference generate. And as we do so,\nwe should keep in mind that many of those who studied the\nObservations in the dissenting academies appear to have\nvalued Hartley primarily as a moral theorist and exemplar\u2014for,\nthat is, his description of the path of moral transformation. Such is\na common theme in their recollections.\n\n(1) We noted above Hartley\u2019s collaboration with his friend\nStephen Hales to discover a medical treatment that would dissolve\nbladder stones. Following Newton, Hales believed \u201cforces of\nattraction and repulsion\u201d to be the basis of physical nature,\nand through various chemical experiments he demonstrated that solid\nconcretions, including bladder stones, were compounds that had locked\nwithin themselves large quantities of \u201cair,\u201d which\nnormally manifests a strongly repelling force. The \u201cair\u201d\nwithin a bladder stone could be released, and the stone dissolved,\nthrough reaction with an agent that would change the pH of the urine.\nSuch chemicals are plentiful in the laboratory; the two men were\nlooking for one that a person could safely ingest.\n\nIn his Statical Essays, Hales proposes that \u201cair\u201d\nis a component in many \u201canimal, vegetable, and mineral\nsubstances\u201d:\n\nIf all the parts of matter were only endued with a strongly attracting\npower, whole nature would then immediately become one unactive\ncohering lump; wherefore it was absolutely necessary \u2026 that\nthere should be every where intermixed with it a due proportion of\nstrongly repelling elastick particles, \u2026 [and] that these\nparticles should be endued with a property of resuming their elastick\nstate, . . . that thereby this beautiful frame of things might be\nmaintained in a continual round of the production and dissolution of\nanimal and vegetable bodies. (Hales 1769, 1:314\u201315)\n\n\nA seemingly inert particle of matter contains within itself forces of\nattraction and repulsion in a dynamic equilibrium. (Hence the\nreadiness of the particles constituting the nerves to\n\u201cvibrate.\u201d) In such particles concretions and dissolutions\noccur continuously; the materials within the bodies of living things\nform, dissolve, and form again\u2014\u201cthat thereby this\nbeautiful frame of things might be maintained.\u201d\n\nHartley extends these chemical concepts to psychology. As an analogy\nto the forces of \u201cattraction\u201d and \u201crepulsion,\u201d\nhe writes of both \u201cassociations\u201d and\n\u201ccounter-associations\u201d at work in generating the frame of\na person\u2019s self. The role of association is\nobvious\u2014through \u201cjoint impression,\u201d it generates\n\u201cideas,\u201d including the complex movements that are the\nbasis of the decomplex actions we perform every day. And as we shall\nsee shortly, psychological associations form (\u201cmodel\u201d) the\nbasic orientations of the self. But \u201ccounter-associations\u201d\nare equally vital. The counter-associations in our dreams, for\nexample, are \u201cof singular use to us, by interrupting and\nbreaking the course of our associations. For, if we were always awake,\nsome accidental associations would be cemented by continuance, as that\nnothing could afterwards disjoin them, which would be madness\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 91). A sane mind, therefore, is one\n\u201cmaintained in a continual round of the production and\ndissolution\u201d\u2014in, that is, a dynamic balance of connection\nand detachment, memory and forgetting, that holds out the possibility\nof change and transformation.\n\n(2) We noted in the discussion of action that, in Hartley\u2019s\ntheory, a child gains voluntary control over his body through a series\nof substitutions. A similar series of substitutions, or\n\u201ctransferences\u201d of emotion, are at work in the formation\nof a person\u2019s character. For example, Hartley offers a\nfascinating, detailed account of how the spontaneous gesture by which\na frightened, abused child raises his hand to ward off a blow becomes,\nthrough a series of such transferences, the blow the abusing adult\ndirects in anger at a helpless child (OM 1, prop. 97). Here,\nthe links by which fear is transferred, and transmuted into anger,\ninclude the situational, symbolic, and semantic: from, for example,\nbeing struck to the \u201csigns and tokens\u201d of an impending\nbeating\u2014e.g., the bottle of gin, or the words of abuse and\naffection, the curses and kisses, that attend drunkenness.\n\n(3) Hartley offers an original model of psychological development. The\nvarious emotional states (\u201cpleasures and pains\u201d) we\nexperience structure themselves into \u201csix classes\u201d:\nimagination, ambition, self-interest, sympathy, theopathy, and the\nmoral sense. These form two groups of three, each consisting of two\nbasic orientations and a means of regulating them.\n\nThe first group consists of imagination, the orientation toward\nobjects as sources of pleasure or displeasure, and of ambition,\nwhereby pleasure or pain derive from one\u2019s awareness of\none\u2019s standing in the eyes of others. In this group\nself-interest is the ego, which attempts to manage and satisfy the\ndemands of imagination and ambition. The second group combines\nsympathy, the orientation of personal intersubjectivity, and\ntheopathy, the person\u2019s relationship with what the person takes\nto be the divine. (\u201cTheopathy\u201d appears to be\nHartley\u2019s invention.) Hartley calls the moral sense (a term then\nin widespread use) the \u201cmonitor\u201d of sympathy and\ntheopathy; it is a higher ego, or self, beyond the ego.\n\nThe psychological structure the groups represent is epigenetic and\ntransformative. Like the accounts of twentieth-century psychologists\nsuch as Maslow, Erikson, and Kohlberg, Hartley\u2019s theory\ndescribes a process of moral development as a sequence of\ntransformations of the self.\n\nThe process is epigenetic in that the earlier orientations\n\u201cmodel\u201d the orientations that follow them. A young child,\nfor example, enjoys a pleasure of imagination when playing with new\ntoys; but when that pleasure transfers to the status that derives from\nbeing perceived by others to be a (good) child who has a collection of\nprized toys, the child is now experiencing a pleasure of ambition. And\nimagination and ambition then \u201cmodel\u201d self-interest, as\nthe child weighs the pleasures and pains, benefits and costs, of\nactually playing with the toys versus keeping them on the shelf for\npurposes of display. The problem remains in later life, when the\npleasures of purchased objects derive more from their symbolic value\nthan from actual use. This is especially the case when the purchases\nare made to satisfy the pleasures of ambition\u2014of being perceived\nas the kind of person who can own a Mercedes, or who is fluent in the\nconstantly changing idioms of fashion.\n\nAlso contributing to the epigenetic modeling of the self is the fact\nthat imagination, ambition, and self-interest inevitably generate\ncounter-associations\u2014experiences of pain or indifference where\none anticipated pleasure. Indulgence in the pleasures of imagination,\nHartley writes, often \u201clead[s] men into such a degree of\nsolicitude, anxiety, and fearfulness, in minute affairs, as to make\nthem inflict upon themselves greater torments, than the most cruel\ntyrant could invent\u201d (OM 2, 54). Similarly with\nambition: keeping up with the \u201clatest\u201d fashion (in cars,\nclothes, or philosophers) for the sake of winning others\u2019\napproval is hard work.\n\n\u201cWe do, and must, upon our entrance into the world, begin with\nidolatry to external things, and, as we advance in it, proceed to the\nidolatry of ourselves\u201d (OM 2, prop. 4). Some thus\nremain, anxiously pouring their sacrifices over these concretions. In\nothers the inevitable, painful counter-associations act as solvents,\nand cause the stony idols to disintegrate. Sympathy and theopathy\nreplace imagination and ambition as \u201cprimary pursuits,\u201d\nthe fundamental modes of experience and interaction. Hartley calls\nthis reorienting transformation the \u201cannihilation of\nself.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cannihilation\u201d is not quasi-mystical obliteration;\nrather, it is a reorientation toward, or discovery of, a higher self\nof sympathy, theopathy, and the moral sense. It involves liberation\nfrom what William Blake calls the \u201cmind-forged manacles\u201d\nof a self-created and self-regarding hell and an awakening to\none\u2019s true humanity.\n\nOnce they are \u201cmodeled,\u201d the higher orientations\n\u201cnew-model\u201d the lower. For the person for whom sympathy\nand theopathy are primary pursuits, imagination and ambition remain\nmodes of interaction, but modes that are transformed. Beauty may now\nbe perceived in people and things previously passed over with\nindifference or distaste. And one\u2019s happiness, indeed\none\u2019s hopes for one\u2019s self, may be linked with the\nhappiness of people one previously sought to avoid.\n\nThis does not mean, for Hartley, that life gets easier. Rather he\ndescribes the path as increasingly difficult. Although profoundly\noptimistic about the ultimate future of humanity\u2014he is\ndescribing, after all, how association tends \u201cto reduce the\nstate of those who have eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and\nevil, back again to a paradisiacal one\u201d\u2014he is acutely\naware of the many bypaths of human self-deception and destructiveness.\nHe is especially conscious of the dangers facing those whose primary\npursuit concerns being sympathetic, theopathic, and morally\nperceptive. Such a person can become \u201ca bitter persecuting\nspirit\u201d (OM 1, prop. 97). In general, the\n\u201chigher\u201d the level of moral and spiritual attainment, the\ngreater the potential for a crippling, demonic destructiveness. In\nthis regard, reading Hartley one encounters a vision of human nature\nas deeply conflicted, struggling against itself\u2014a view similar\nto what one finds in Dostoyevsky or Kierkegaard.\n\nAlthough Hartley identifies \u201csympathy\u201d and\n\u201ctheopathy\u201d as basic orientations, the orientations do not\nnecessarily have a positive content. Hartley does not claim that\neveryone is kind to others, or loves God. In some, these modes are\npathological, and theopathy is often only rudimentarily developed. In\ndiscussing the \u201cassociations [that] may be observed in fact to\nbe heaped upon\u201d the word God, he observes that these\nbegin with the \u201ccompound fictitious idea\u201d children form\nwhen they \u201csuppose [God] to stand for a man whom they have never\nseen\u201d and that they end, for many people, when this idea\n\u201cis quite obliterated, without anything of a stable precise\nnature succeeding in its room\u201d (OM 1, prop. 98). Many\nadults live with feelings of fear, aversion, boredom, and sometimes an\nardent longing, directed at a blankness\u2014a mental picture, from\nwhich the central image has been effaced.\n\nHartley\u2019s model of the self in terms of imagination, ambition,\nand self-interest, and then of sympathy, theopathy, and the moral\nsense, is dynamically complex. In his moral psychology, emotions are\nlike electrical charges that easily jump from one object, symbol,\nword, or thought to another. Through such \u201ctransferences\u201d\nof emotion, the six orientations develop content; like physical\nconcretions, they coalesce, as emotional energies are bonded together.\nAnd when the energy in one is sufficiently strong, the orientation\nbecomes the person\u2019s \u201cprimary pursuit\u201d: it demands\naccretion of pleasure.\n\nStill, the model is not static, with the self fossilizing into\n\u201cone unactive cohering lump.\u201d Thanks to the interplay of\nassociations and counter-associations, the six orientations both\n\u201cmodel\u201d and \u201cnew-model\u201d each other.\nPsychological bodies are, as Hales said of vegetable and animal bodies,\nin \u201ca continual round of the production and\ndissolution\u201d\u2014until such time, Hartley believed, as when\nall shall discover their identity in that \u201cmystical body\u201d\nin which \u201call have an equal care for each other\u2019s\n[happiness]; all increase in love, and come to their full\nstature, to perfect manhood, by that which every joint\nsupplieth\u201d (OM 2, prop. 68; cf. Ephesians\n4.16).\n",
