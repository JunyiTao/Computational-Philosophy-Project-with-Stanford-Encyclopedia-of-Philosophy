Those considered contrarians come in many\nvarieties, from climate scientists who consider headline attribution\nclaims to be insufficiently justified\u2014they are usually described\nas climate \u201cskeptics\u201d\u2014to individuals and groups from\noutside of climate science whose primary motivation is to block\nclimate policy, in some cases by \u201cmanufacturing doubt\u201d\nabout the reality or seriousness of anthropogenic climate change; they\nare commonly labelled climate \u201cdeniers\u201d (see, e.g.,\nOreskes & Conway 2010; Ranalli 2012). (The use of these labels\nvaries, however.) Contrarians have played a role in creating or\nsustaining a number of public controversies related to climate\nscience. Four of these are discussed very briefly below, along with\nsome recent philosophical work reflecting on the impact of contrarian\ndissent.\n\nThe Tropospheric Temperature Controversy. Climate model\nsimulations indicate that rising greenhouse gas concentrations will\ninduce warming not only at earth\u2019s surface but also in the layer\nof atmosphere extending 8\u201312 km above the surface, known as the\ntroposphere. Satellites and radiosondes are the primary means\nof monitoring temperatures in this layer. Analyses of these data in\nthe early 1990s, when only about a decade of satellite data was\navailable, indicated a lack of warming in the troposphere (Spencer\n& Christy 1990). Prima facie, this presented a challenge to\nclimate science, and it became a key piece of evidence in contrarian\ndismissals of the threat of anthropogenic climate change. Over time,\nadditional research uncovered numerous problems with the satellite and\nradiosonde data used to estimate tropospheric temperature trends, with\nmany of these problems related to homogenization (NRC 2000; Karl et\nal. 2006). More recent observational estimates agree that the\ntroposphere has been warming and, although observed trends still tend\nto be somewhat smaller than those in simulations, the mainstream view\nis that there is \u201cno fundamental discrepancy\u201d between\nobservations and models, given the significant uncertainties involved\n(Thorne et al. 2011). Nevertheless, the debate continues (see, e.g.,\nChristy et al. 2010; Santer et al. 2017). Lloyd (2012) suggests that\nthis controversy in part involves a conflict between a \u201cdirect\nempiricist\u201d view that sees observational data as a naked\nreflection of reality, taking priority over models, and a more nuanced\n\u201ccomplex empiricist\u201d view (see also Edwards 2010:\n417).\n\nThe Hockey Stick Controversy. The hockey stick controversy\nfocused on some of the first millennial-scale paleoclimate\nreconstructions of the evolution of Northern Hemisphere mean\nnear-surface temperature. These reconstructions, when joined with the\ninstrumental temperature record, indicate a long, slow decline in\ntemperature followed by a sharp rise beginning around 1900; their\nshape is reminiscent of a hockey stick (e.g., Mann et al. 1998, 1999).\nSuch reconstructions featured prominently in the IPCC\u2019s Third\nAssessment Report (Albritton et al. 2001) and constituted part of the\nevidence for the IPCC conclusion that \u201cthe 1990s are likely to\nhave been the warmest decade of the millennium\u201d (Folland et al.\n2001: 102). Contrarian criticism in the published literature followed\ntwo main lines. One argued that there were problems with the data and\nstatistical methods used in producing the reconstructions (McIntyre\n& McKitrick 2003, 2005), while a second appealed to additional\nproxy data and alternative methods for their interpretation in order\nto challenge the uniqueness of late-twentieth century warming (Soon et\nal. 2003). Mainstream climate scientists offered direct replies to\nthese challenges (e.g., Mann et al. 2003; Wahl & Ammann 2007), and\nadditional research has since produced new and longer reconstructions\nusing a variety of proxies, which also support the conclusion that the\nlate twentieth century was anomalously warm (Masson-Delmotte et al.\n2013).\n [6]\n Contrarians, however, continue to criticize temperature\nreconstructions and the conclusions drawn from them, on various\ngrounds; a recent target was Marcott et al. 2013. Book length accounts\nof the controversy from opposing sides include Montford 2010 and Mann\n2012.\n\nThe Climategate Controversy. In 2009, a large number of\nemails were taken from the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic\nResearch Unit and made public without authorization. Authors of the\nemails included climate scientists at a variety of institutions around\nthe world. Focusing primarily on a few passages, contrarians claimed\nthat the emails revealed that climate scientists had manipulated data\nto support the consensus position on anthropogenic climate change and\nhad suppressed legitimate dissenting research in various ways (e.g.,\nby preventing its publication or by refusing to share data). A number\nof independent investigations were subsequently conducted, all\nexonerating climate scientists of the charges of scientific fraud and\nmisconduct that contrarians had alleged (e.g., Russell et al. 2010).\nSome of the investigations, however, did find that climate scientists\nhad failed to be sufficiently transparent, especially in their response to\ncontrarian requests for station data used to estimate changes in\nglobal temperature (ibid.: 11). Despite the exonerations,\nsurveys found that in some countries this \u201cClimategate\u201d\nepisode\u2014as it became known in popular media\u2014significantly\nreduced public trust in climate science (Leiserowitz et al. 2013).\n\nThe Hiatus Controversy. Global mean near-surface temperature\nincreased significantly during the 1990s but then showed little\nincrease between the late 1990s and the early 2010s. By the mid-2000s,\ncontrarians began to claim that global warming had stopped and that\nclimate models (and climate science) were thus fundamentally flawed,\nsince they had projected more warming. Part of the problem here was\ncommunication: graphs shared with policymakers and the public often\nhighlighted the average of climate model projections, which smoothed\nout the significant variability seen in individual simulations and\nsuggested a relatively steady warming; in fact, the observed rate of\nwarming was not so different from that seen in some of the model\nprojections (see Schmidt 2012; Risbey et al. 2014). Moreover,\nsignificant variations in temperature on decadal time scales, akin to\nthat seen in the observations, were not entirely unexpected, given\ninternal variability in the climate system (Easterling & Wehner\n2009). Nevertheless, by the early 2010s, pressure was mounting for\nclimate scientists to give a detailed explanation of the apparent\nslowdown in surface warming, by then referred to as the\n\u201chiatus\u201d or \u201cpause\u201d, and to explain why most\nmodels projected more warming. A preliminary analysis was given in the\nIPCC Fifth Assessment Report (see Flato et al. 2013: Box 9.2). A host\nof potential explanatory factors were identified\u2014related to\nexternal forcing, internal variability, ocean heat uptake and errors in\nobservational data\u2014which contrarians portrayed as excuses.\nSubsequent investigation found evidence for actual contributions from\nmost of the hypothesized factors, though discussion of their relative\nimportance continues (see Medhaug et al. 2017 for an overview;\na large literature on the topic has emerged). In the meantime, since\n2014, global mean temperature has once again shown a sharp increase,\nin part due to a strong El Ni\u00f1o event in 2015/16.\n\nContrarian dissent has impacted the practice of climate science in\nvarious ways. Most obviously, research is sometimes directed (at least in part) at rebutting contrarian claims and arguments. For example, a recent research\npaper related to tropospheric temperature trends (Santer et al. 2017)\nis explicitly framed as a response to contrarian claims made in the\ncourse of testimony to the U.S. Senate (see also Lewandowsky et al. 2015 on \"seepage\" and the hiatus controversy). In addition, Brysse et al.\n(2013) contend that pressure from contrarians and the risk of being\naccused of alarmism may be part of the explanation for climate\nscientists\u2019 tendency to err on the side of caution in their\npredictions related to climate change. Drawing these threads together,\nBiddle and Leuschner (2015) suggest that contrarian dissent has\nimpeded scientific progress in at least two ways: \n\n\nby (1) forcing scientists to respond to a seemingly endless wave of\nunnecessary and unhelpful objections and demands and (2) creating an\natmosphere in which scientists fear to address certain topics and/or\nto defend hypotheses as forcefully as they believe is appropriate.\n(Biddle & Leuschner 2015: 269) \n\n\nThey argue that, while dissent is science is often epistemically\nfruitful, the dissent expressed by climate contrarians has tended to\nbe epistemically detrimental (see also Biddle et al. 2017; Leuschner\n2018).\n",
