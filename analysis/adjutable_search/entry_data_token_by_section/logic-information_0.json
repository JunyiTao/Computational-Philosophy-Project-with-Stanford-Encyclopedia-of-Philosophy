    "main_text": "Information as Range\n1. Information as Range\n\nThe understanding of information as range has its origins in\nBar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s theory of semantic information,\nBar-Hillel and Carnap\n (1952).[1]\n It is here that the inverse range principle is given its\nfirst articulation with regard to the informational content of a\nproposition. The inverse range principle states that there is an\ninverse relationship between the information contained by a\nproposition on the one hand, and the likelihood of that proposition\nbeing true on the other. That is, the more information carried by a\nproposition, the less likely it is that the proposition is true.\nSimilarly, the more likely the truth of a proposition, the less\ninformation it carries.\n\nThe likelihood of the truth of a proposition connects with information\nas range via a possible worlds semantics. For any contingent\nproposition, it will be supported by some possibilities (those where\nit is true) and not supported by others (those where it is false).\nHence a proposition will be supported by a range of possibilities, an\n\u201cinformation range\u201d. Now suppose that there is a\nprobability distribution across the space of possibilities, and for\nthe sake of simplicity suppose that the distribution is uniform. In\nthis case, the more worlds that support a proposition, the likelier\nthe proposition\u2019s truth, and, via the inverse relationship\nprinciple, the less information it carries. Although information as\nrange has its origins in quantitative information theory, its role in\ncontemporary qualitative logics of information cannot be\noverstated.\n\nConsider the following example due to Johan van Benthem (2011). A\nwaiter in a cafe receives an order for your table\u2014an espresso\nand a soda. When the waiter arrives at your table, he asks \u201cFor\nwhom is the soda?\u201d. After your telling him that the soda is for\nyou and his giving you your soda, the waiter does not need to ask\nabout the espresso, he can just give it to your cafe-partner. This is\nbecause the information gained by the waiter from your telling him\nthat you ordered the soda allows him to eliminate certain open\npossibilities from the total range of possibilities such that only one\nis left\u2014your friend ordered the espresso.\n\nThe waiter case brings several facts about logic and information to\nthe fore. For one, language is used often to refine informational\noptions in the very way explained in the paragraph above. More subtly\nhowever, and perhaps even prior to this, language is used to\nexchange information, and we bring with us sometimes many\nscenarios\u2014specified informationally. These scenarios might be\nneither known nor believed, but merely\nentertained\u2014those about which we wonder.\nRecent work on inquisitive semantics (Ciardelli et\nal. 2018) provides a logic of such information exchange based on\ninformational specifications of such wonderings.\n\nLogics of information distinguish regularly between hard\ninformation and soft information. The terminology is a\nslight misnomer, as this distinction is not one between different\ntypes of information per se. Rather it is one between\ndifferent types of information storage. Hard information is\nfactive, and unrevisable. Hard information is often taken to\ncorrespond to knowledge. In contrast to hard information,\nsoft information is non-necessarily-factive, hence revisable\nin the presence of new information. Soft information, in virtue of its\nrevisability, corresponds very closely to belief. The terms\nknowledge and belief are conventional, but on the context of\ninformation flow, the hard/soft information reading is convenient on\naccount of it bringing the informational phenomena to the foreground.\nAt the very least the terminology is increasingly popular, so being\nclear on the distinction being one between types of information\nstorage as opposed to types of information is important. Although both\nhard and soft information are important for our epistemic and doxastic\nsuccess, in this section we will concentrate mainly on logics of hard\ninformation\n flow.[2]\n\nIn\n section 1.1\n we will see how it is that classic epistemic logics exemplify the\nflow of hard information within the information as range framework. In\n section 1.2\n we will extend our exposition from logics of hard information-gain to\nlogics of the actions that facilitate the gain of such hard\ninformation, dynamic epistemic logics. At the end of Section 1.2, we\nwill expound the important phenomenon of private information,\nbefore examining how it is that information as range is captured in\nvarious quantitative frameworks.\n",
