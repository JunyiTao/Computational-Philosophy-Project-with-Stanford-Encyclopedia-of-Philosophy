    "main_text": "Harman\u2019s challenge || The objections\n3.1 The objections\n\nIMP\n and\n CON\n are thus a first\u2014if rather flatfooted\u2014attempt at pinning\ndown the elusive normative connection between logic and norms of\nreasoning. Harman considers these responses and responds in turn. The\nfollowing four objections against our provisional principles can, in\nlarge part, be found in the writings of Harman.\n\n\n(1) Suppose I believe \\(p\\) and \\(p \\supset q\\) (as well as Modus\nPonens). The mere fact that I have these beliefs and that I recognize\nthem to jointly entail \\(q\\) does not normatively compel any\nparticular attitude towards \\(q\\) on my part. In particular, it is not\nthe case in general that I ought to come to believe \\(q\\) as\n IMP\n would have it. After all, \\(q\\) may be at odds with my evidence in\nwhich case it may be unreasonable for me to slavishly follow Modus\nPonens and to form a belief in \\(q\\). The rational course of\n\u201caction\u201d, rather, when \\(q\\) is untenable, is for me to\nrelinquish my belief in at least one of my antecedent beliefs \\(p\\)\nand \\(p \\supset q\\) on account of their unpalatable implications.\nThus, logical principles do not invariably offer reliable guidance in\ndeciding what to believe (at least, when the relation between logical\nprinciples and our practices of belief-formation are understood along\nthe lines of\n IMP).\n Let us therefore call this the Objection from Belief Revision.\n\n\nJohn Broome (2000: 85) offers a closely related objection, which\nnevertheless deserves separate mention. Broome observes that any\nproposition trivially entails itself. From\n IMP\n it thus follows that I ought to believe any proposition I in\nfact believe. But this seems patently false: I might hold any number\nof irresponsibly acquired beliefs. The fact that, by mere\nhappenstance, I hold these beliefs, in no way implies that I ought to\nbelieve them. Call this variation of the Objection from Belief Revision, the\nBootstrapping Objection.\n\n\n\n\n(2) A further worry is that a reasoner with limited cognitive\nresources would be unreasonable to abide by\n IMP\n because she would be obligated to form countless utterly useless\nbeliefs. Any of the propositions I believe entails an\ninfinite number of propositions that are of no interest to me\nwhatsoever. Not only do I not care about, say, the disjunction\n\u201cI am wearing blue socks or pigs can fly\u201d entailed by my\ntrue belief that I am wearing blue socks, it would be positively\nirrational of me to squander my scarce cognitive resources of time,\ncomputational power and storage capacity in memory and so on, on idly deriving implications of\nmy beliefs when these are of no value to me. Harman fittingly dubs the\nprinciple of reasoning in question Principle of Clutter\nAvoidance. Let us call the corresponding objection the\nObjection from Clutter Avoidance.\n\n\n\n(3) There is another sense in which both\n principles\u2014IMP\n and\n CON\u2014place\n excessive demands on agents whose resources are limited. Consider the\nfollowing example. Suppose I believe the axioms of Peano arithmetic.\nSuppose further that a counterintuitive arithmetical proposition that\nis of great interest to me is entailed by the axioms, but that its\nshortest proof has more steps than there are protons in the visible\nuniverse. According to\n IMP,\n I ought to believe the proposition in question. However, if the\nlogical \u201cought\u201d implies \u201ccan\u201d (relative to \ncapacities even remotely like our own),\n IMP\n cannot be correct. An analogous objection can be leveled at\n CON.\n An agent may harbor an inconsistent belief set, yet detecting the\ninconsistency may be too difficult for any ordinary agent. We may summarize\nthese objections under the label Objection from Excessive Demands.\n\n\n\n(4) Finally, I may find myself in epistemic circumstances in which\ninconsistency is not merely excusable on account of my \u201cfinitary\npredicament\u201d (Cherniak 1986), but where inconsistency appears to\nbe rationally required. Arguably, the Preface Paradox constitutes such\na scenario (Makinson\n 1965).[15]\n Here is one standard way of presenting it. Suppose I author a\nmeticulously researched non-fiction book. My book is composed of a\nlarge set of non-trivial propositions \\(p_{1},\\dots, p_{n}\\). Seeing\nthat all of my claims are the product of scrupulous research, I have\nevery reason firmly to believe each of the \\(p_{i}\\) individually. But\nI also have overwhelming inductive evidence for \\(q\\): that at least\none of my beliefs is in error. The \\(p_{i}\\) and \\(q\\) cannot be\njointly true since \\(q\\) is equivalent to the negation of the\nconjunction of the \\(p_{i}\\). Yet, it would seem irrational to abandon\nany of my beliefs for the sake of regaining consistency, at least in\nthe absence of any new evidence. The Preface Paradox thus may be\nthought to tell against\n CON:\n arguably, I may be within my rational rights in holding inconsistent\nbeliefs (at least in certain contexts). However, it also seems to\nconstitute a direct counterexample to\n IMP.\n For in the Preface scenario I believe each of the \\(p_{i}\\) and yet\nit looks as if I ought to disbelieve an obvious logical consequence\nthereof: their conjunction (because \\(q\\) is transparently equivalent\nto \\(\\neg (p_{1} \\land \\dots \\land p_{n})\\)).\n\n\nSo much for the objections to\n IMP\n and\n CON.\n The question raised by these considerations is whether these principles can be improved upon.\n",
