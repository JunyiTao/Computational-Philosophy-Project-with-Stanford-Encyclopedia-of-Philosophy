The constructivist Steven Katz notes our \u201cmost\nbrutish, infantile, and sensate levels\u201d of experience when we\nwere infants (Katz 1988, 755). It is hard to see why in principle\nwe could not retrieve such an unconceptualized level of\nexperience. \n\n\nIt makes little difference whether a PCE is called an\n\u201cexperience\u201d or an \u201cevent.\u201d A PCE occurs within a wider\nexperience of the subject, including the subject\u2019s coming out of\nthe PCE and assigning it meaning. Let this wider experience be the\n\u201cexperience\u201d under discussion, rather than the PCE alone.\n\n\n\nNeuropsychological studies of mystical experience point to the\npossibility of a state of pure consciousness. For example,\na theory by Eugene d\u2019Aquili and Andrew Newberg (1999)\naccounts for PCEs by reference to occurrences in the brain that cut\noff ordinary brain activity from consciousness. (Also see Hood 2006\nand Section 9.7 below.) \n\n\nThere may be no problem about mystics knowing they had PCEs. If\nwe accept a reliabilist account of knowledge, a belief is knowledge if\nproduced by a reliable cognitive mechanism (perhaps with some further\nconditions). In order to have knowledge, a person does not have to be\naware of and judge evidence, nor be cognizant of the reliability of\nthe mechanism that produces the knowledge. Hence, \u201cawakening\u201d from\nwhat is in fact a PCE, if it produces the belief that one has\n\u201cawakened\u201d from a PCE, could be a reliable cognitive mechanism\nsufficient for knowing one had had a PCE. If we stick to an\nevidentialist conception of knowledge, mystics might be able to have\nevidence they had undergone a PCE, though not at the time of its\noccurrence, since a conscious event can have elements that one\ndoes not note at the time but recalls afterward. This is\nespecially possible when the recall immediately follows the event.\nThat is, some content was retained and the experience was not truly\nempty, even if the content is only a nondual consciousness.\nTherefore, it should be possible for a mystic who undergoes a PCE to\nrecall immediately afterward the awareness that was present in the\nPCE, even though that awareness was not an object of consciousness at\nthe time of the PCE. \n\n\nDefenders of PCEs can champion their epistemological significance,\nalthough PCEs are not experiences of anything. The\nnoetic quality of a mystical experience can come from an acquaintance\nof states of affairs involving an insight directly, without\nsupervening on acquaintance of any reality. Nor need the insight be\nsimultaneous with the occurrence of the experience but may arise\nlater. Hence, a person could undergo a PCE that granted acquaintance\nof states of affairs by a direct insight. The PCE plus the insight\nwould constitute a complex mystical experience that afforded awareness\nof a state of affairs not otherwise accessible. \n\n",
