    "main_text": "Higher-Order Evidence\n3. Higher-Order Evidence\n\nQuestions about the rationality (or reasonableness or justifiedness)\nand import of epistemic self-doubt can be developed as questions about\nwhether and how to respect evidence about one\u2019s evidence.\nHigher-order evidence is evidence about what evidence one possesses or\nwhat conclusions one\u2019s evidence supports (see entry on\n evidence).\n This issue about the upshot of higher-order evidence does not in the\nfirst instance depend on whether we take such evidence as necessary\nfor justification of first-order beliefs. The question is how our\nbeliefs should relate to our beliefs about our beliefs when we do\nhappen to have evidence about our evidence, as we often do (Feldman\n2005; Christensen 2010a; Kelly 2005, 2010).\n\nSelf-doubt is a special case of responding to higher-order evidence.\nNot all evidence about our evidence arises from self-doubt because not\nall such evidence is about oneself, as we will see below. Also,\nrepresenting self-doubting situations as responding to evidence about\nmy evidence takes information about my capacities to be important just\ninsofar as it provides evidence that I have either incorrectly\nidentified my evidence or incorrectly evaluated the support relation\nbetween my evidence and my conclusion. For example, in the case of the\ndoctor above who receives evidence that she is severely underslept,\nthe reason she should reconsider her diagnosis is because this is\nevidence that she might be wrong either in reading the lab tests or in\nthinking that the evidence of lab tests and symptoms supports her\ndiagnosis. By contrast the fourth approach below via calibration does\nnot see the implications of self-doubt as necessarily proceeding via\nevidence about our evidence or evidential support.\n\nLike the approach via the maximally rational agent, the evidential\napproach has the virtue of identifying a justification for responding\nto the second-order beliefs that self-doubt brings. Their authority\ncomes from the facts that they are evidence relevant to whether one\nhas good evidence for one\u2019s first-order belief, and that one\nshould respect one\u2019s evidence. This raises the hope that what we\nalready know about evidence can help settle when negative second-order\nevidence should override a first order belief and when not. Many\nauthors have thought that in either kind of case rationality demands\nthat the two orders eventually match, in some sense, but we will see\nbelow that more recent thinking about evidence has led some to defend\nthe rationality of having the first- and second-order beliefs in\ntension, for some cases. Another virtue of the evidential approach is\nthat merely knowing what your beliefs are doesn\u2019t automatically\nimply that a state of self-doubt is inconsistent or incoherent as it\ndid in first two approaches above, via categorical beliefs and\nconditional principles. There is no obvious contradiction in believing\nboth q and that one\u2019s evidence doesn\u2019t support\nq, even if one also has a correct belief that one believes\nq, so what may be irrational about the state must be based on\nfurther considerations.\n\nThe higher-order evidence approach can be usefully developed through\nthe example of hypoxia, a condition of impaired judgment that is\ncaused by lack of sufficient oxygen, and that is rarely recognized by\nthe sufferer at its initial onset. Hypoxia is a risk at altitudes of\n10,000 feet and higher (Christensen 2010b: 126\u2013127). Suppose you\nare a pilot who does a recalculation while flying, to conclude that\nyou have more than enough fuel to get to an airport fifty miles\nfurther than the one in your initial plan. Suppose you then glance at\nthe altimeter to see that you\u2019re at 10,500 feet and remember the\nphenomenon of hypoxia and its insidious onset. You now have evidence\nthat you might have hypoxia and therefore might have misidentified the\nsupport relations between your evidence and your conclusion. Are you\nnow justified in believing that you can get to the more distant\nairport? Are you justified in believing that your evidence supports\nthat claim?\n\nLetting F be the proposition that you have sufficient fuel to\nget to the more distant airport, the following four answers are\npossible:\n\n You are justified in believing F, but no longer justified\nin believing that your (1st-order) evidence supports\nF.\n You are justified in believing F and justified in\nbelieving that your (1st-order) evidence supports\nF.\n You are not justified in believing F, and not justified in\nbelieving that your (1st-order) evidence supports\nF.\n You are not justified in believing F, but you are\njustified in believing that your (1st-order) evidence\nsupports F.\n\n\n4) doesn\u2019t seem plausible; even if you can\u2019t actually\nbring yourself to believe F, being justified in believing your\nevidence supports F prima facie justifies you in believing\nF.\n\nHowever none of the other answers seem to be entirely adequate either.\nIt may seem, as in 1, that you could still be justified in believing\nF\u2014in case your calculation was actually right\u2014but\nno longer have strong enough reason to believe that the calculation\nwas right. However, this would also mean that you could justifiably\nbelieve \u201cF, but my overall evidence doesn\u2019t support\nF\u201d. Feldman (2005: 110\u2013111) argues that it is\nimpossible for this belief to be both true and reasonable since the\nsecond conjunct undermines the reasonableness of the first conjunct\n(cf. Bergmann 2005: 243; Gibbons 2006: 32; Adler 2002). And if you\nwere aware of having this belief then you would be believing something\nthat you know is unreasonable if true. You would be, in the view of\nFeldman and others, disrespecting the evidence. The state in which you\nbelieve \u201cF and my evidence does not support F\u201d is a case\nof \u201clevel-splitting\u201d, also called epistemic\nakrasia, because you believe you ought not to have a particular\nbelief state but you have it anyway.\n\nThe second reply\u2014you are justified in believing F and\njustified in believing that your evidence supports\nF\u2014might seem reasonable in some cases, for example if the\nevidence about one\u2019s evidence comes in the form of skeptical\nphilosophical arguments, which one may think are too\nrecherch\u00e9 to command revisions in our everyday\nbeliefs. But this attitude hardly seems acceptable in general since it\nwould mean never giving ground on a first-order belief when presented\nwith evidence that you may be wrong about what your evidence implies.\nWhen flying airplanes this kind of rigidity could even be hazardous.\nHowever, Feldman counts the second reply as a possible way of\nrespecting the evidence; it might be fitting not only when faced with\nradical skeptical arguments but also in cases where one\u2019s\ninitial view of what the first-order evidence supports is actually\ncorrect.\n\nThe third reply, that after noting the altimeter evidence one\nisn\u2019t justified in believing that one\u2019s evidence supports\nF and also isn\u2019t justified in believing F has the\nvirtue of caution but also the consequence that the altimeter evidence\ndeprives you of justification for believing F even if you do\nnot suffer from hypoxia, which Feldman takes to be problematic.\nHowever, this response, unlike the first answer, respects the\nhigher-order evidence; the altimeter evidence gives you some reason to\nbelieve that you might suffer from hypoxia, which gives you some\nreason to believe your evidence does not support F. The\nmisfortune of being deprived of your knowledge even if you don\u2019t\nactually have hypoxia is an instance of the familiar misfortune of\nmisleading evidence in general. However, as we will see shortly,\nmisleading higher-order self-doubting evidence is distinct from other\nhigher-order evidence, and some recent authors have been led by this\nto the view that option 1 above\u2014akrasia\u2014can be more\nrational than option 3 in some cases.\n\nNotably, in both of the replies that Feldman counts as possible ways\nof respecting the evidence, 2) and 3), the first-order and\nhigher-order attitudes match; one either is justified in believing\nF and justified in believing one\u2019s evidence supports\nF, or isn\u2019t justified in believing F and also\nisn\u2019t justified in believing one\u2019s evidence supports\nF. On getting evidence suggesting one\u2019s evidence does not\nsupport one\u2019s conclusion, one should either maintain that it\ndoes so support and maintain the first-order belief\u2014be\n\u201csteadfast\u201d\u2014or grant that it might not support\none\u2019s first-order belief and give up the latter\u2014be\n\u201cconciliatory\u201d. If one thinks that which of these\nattitudes is the right response varies with the case, then the\n\u201ctotal evidence\u201d view will be attractive. On this view\nwhether the first order should concede to the second depends on the\nrelative strength of the evidence at each level. (Kelly 2010)\n\nIn the conciliatory cases, self-doubting higher-order evidence acts as\na defeater of justification for belief, which raises the question of\nits similarities to and differences from other defeaters. In John\nPollock\u2019s (1989) terminology, some defeaters of justification\nfor a conclusion are rebutters, that is, are simply evidence against\nthe conclusion, while other defeaters are undercutters; they undermine\nthe relation between the evidence and the conclusion. (These are also\nreferred to as Type I and Type II defeaters.) The pilot we imagined\nwould be getting a rebutting defeater of her justification for\nbelieving that she had enough fuel for an extra 50 miles if she looked\nout her window and saw fuel leaking out of her tank. However, if the\naltimeter reading is a defeater, then as evidence about whether she\ndrew the right conclusion from her evidence it is definitely of the\nundercutting type.\n\nAll undercutters are evidence that has implications about the relation\nbetween evidence and conclusion, and to that extent are higher-order\nevidence. But the higher-order evidence that leads to self-doubt is\ndistinct from other undercutting-type evidence. In the classic Type II\ndefeater case one\u2019s justification for believing a cloth is red\nis that it looks red and then one then learns that the cloth is\nilluminated with red light. This evidence undermines your\njustification for believing that the cloth\u2019s looking red is\nsufficient evidence that it is red, by giving information about a\nfeature of the lighting that gives an alternative explanation of the\ncloth\u2019s looking red. This is higher-order evidence because it is\nevidence about the cause of your evidence, and thereby evidence about\nthe support relation between it and the conclusion, but higher-order\nevidence in the cases of the doctor and the pilot are not about how\nthe evidence was caused, and not directly about how matters in the\nworld relevant to one\u2019s conclusion are related to each other.\n\n\nSelf-doubting defeaters are about agents and they are in addition\nagent-specific (Christensen 2010a: 202). They are based on information\nabout you, the person who came to the conclusion about that support\nrelation, and have direct negative implications only for your\nconclusion. In the case of the cloth, anyone with the same evidence\nwould have their justification undercut by the evidence of the red\nlight. The evidence that the doctor is underslept, however, would not\naffect the justification possessed by some other doctor who had\nreasoned from the same evidence to the same conclusion using the same\nbackground knowledge. The evidence that the pilot is at risk of\nhypoxia would not be a reason for a person on the ground, who had\nreasoned from the same instrument readings to the same conclusion, to\ngive up the belief that the plane had enough fuel for fifty more\nmiles.\n\nChristensen argues that the agent-specificity of self-doubting\nhigher-order evidence requires the subject to \u201cbracket\u201d\nher first-order evidence in a way that other defeating evidence does\nnot. He thinks this means that in no longer using the evidence to draw\nthe conclusion, she will not be able to give her evidence its due\n(Christensen 2010a: 194\u2013196). In contrast, in the case of the\nred light and other cases not involving self-doubt, once the redness\nof the light is added to the evidence, discounting the appearance of\nthe cloth doesn\u2019t count as failing to respect that evidence\nbecause one is justified in believing it is no longer due respect as\nevidence of redness. However, arguably, the difference is not that the\nself-doubter must fail to give the evidence its due. In the\nhigher-order self-doubt cases we have seen the undercutting evidence\ndoes not give the subject reason to believe the evidential relation\nshe supposed was there is not there. It gives reason to think that she\ndoesn\u2019t know whether the evidential relation is there, even if\nit is. If it isn\u2019t then in bracketing her first-order evidence\nshe isn\u2019t failing to give it its due; it isn\u2019t due any\nrespect. Because self-doubting defeating evidence concerns the\nsubject\u2019s knowledge of the evidential support relation and not\nthe relation itself it appears weaker than typical defeating evidence.\nHowever it is potentially more corrosive because it doesn\u2019t give\nthe means to settle whether the evidential relation she endorsed is\nthere and so whether the first-order evidence deserves respect.\n\nIf the pilot gives up the belief in F and she had been right\nabout the evidential relation, then she will have been the victim of a\nmisleading defeater. Misleading defeaters present well-known\ndifficulties for a theory of justification based on the idea of defeat\nbecause Type II defeaters may be subject to further defeaters\nindefinitely. For example, if one had learned that the light\nilluminating the cloth was red via testimony, the defeat of\none\u2019s justification for believing the cloth was red would be\ndefeated by good evidence that one\u2019s source was a pathological\nliar. If we say that justified belief requires that there be no\ndefeaters then that leads us to disqualify any case where a misleading\ndefeater exists, and a subject will lose justification she might have\nhad, even if the misleading defeaters are distant facts the\nshe isn\u2019t aware of. But if we refine the view to say that\nonly defeaters for which no defeater exists will undermine\njustification then a subject will count as justified even if she\nignores evidence that looks like a defeater for all she knows, because\nof the existence of a defeater defeater she doesn\u2019t know about.\n In general we will face the question how many and which of the\nexisting defeater defeaters matter to whether we have a justified\nbelief (Harman 1973; Lycan 1977).\n\nIf despite being at an altitude of 10,500 feet our pilot did do the\ncalculation correctly, then her first-order evidence deserved her\nbelief and her evidence from her altitude and the phenomenon of\nhypoxia was a misleading defeater. It was good reason to worry that\nher blood oxygen was low, but it might not have been low, and it would\nbe possible in principle for her to get further evidence that would\nsupport this view, such as from the reading of a finger pulse\noximeter. Misleading defeaters are not new, but few would be tempted\nto say in the case where one gets evidence that the light is red that\nit would be rational for the subject to believe both \u201cmy\nevidence doesn\u2019t support the claim that the cloth is red\u201d\nand \u201cthe cloth is red\u201d. However, for self-doubting type II\ndefeaters several authors have claimed that such level-splitting can\nbe rational.\n\nFor example, Williamson (2011) has argued that it is possible for the\nevidential probability of a proposition to be quite high, while it is\nalso highly probable that the evidential probability is low.\nFor instance one\u2019s evidence about oneself might indicate that\none has made a mistake evaluating one\u2019s evidence, a kind of\nmistake that would lead one to believe an unsupported conclusion,\nF. One evaluates the evidential probability of F as high\nbecause of one\u2019s view of its evidence, but thinks F might\nwell be true without one\u2019s belief in it being knowledge. \n\nAnother way of arguing that it can be rationally required to respond\nto a real support relation\u2014that is, for the pilot, to believe\nF\u2014even when one has evidence it might not exist, and so,\nshould also believe one\u2019s evidence does not (or might not)\nsupport that belief, is with the thought that a rational norm does not\ncease to apply just because a subject has evidence she hasn\u2019t\nfollowed it (Weatherson 2008, 2010 (Other Internet Resources); Coates\n2012). This rationale would not sanction akrasia for one who learned\nthe light was red, because the point is restricted to cases where the\ndefeating evidence concerns the subject; we saw above that that makes\nthe defeating evidence weaker, and it is weaker in just the right way\nto support this approach.\n\nAnother way of arguing that akrasia can be rational is to take the\nexistence of a support relation as sufficient for justification of\nbelief in a proposition whether the subject has correct beliefs about\nthat support relation or not (Wedgwood 2011). This is motivated by\nexternalism about justification (see entry on\n internalist and externalist conceptions of epistemic justification),\n which might be more plausible for justifications subject to\nself-doubting higher order evidence because it is weaker than other\nundercutting evidence. In a different tack, it has been argued that a\ngeneral rule that takes negative self-doubting higher-order evidence\nto always exert some defeating force on first-order beliefs will be\nvery hard to come by. Because the subject is being asked to behave\nrationally in the face of evidence that she has not behaved\nrationally, she is subject to norms that give contradictory advice,\nand fully general rules for adjudicating between such rules are\nsubject to paradoxes (Lasonen-Aarnio 2014).\n\nPossibly the only thing harder than defending a fully general rule\nrequiring the first-order and second-order to match is accepting the\nintuitive consequences of level-splitting or akrasia. In this\nsituation one believes a certain belief state is (or might be)\nirrational but persists in it anyway. Horowitz (2014) has defended the\nNon-Akrasia Constraint (also sometimes referred to as an Enkratic\nPrinciple) which forbids being highly confident in both\n\u201cq\u201d and \u201cmy evidence does not support\nq\u201d, in part by arguing that allowing akrasia\ndelivers highly counter-intuitive follow-on consequences in paradigm\ncases of higher-order evidence. For example, if our pilot maintains\nconfidence that F, she has enough fuel, how should she explain\nhow she got to a belief in F that she thinks is true when she\nalso thinks her evidence does not support F? It would seem that\nshe can only tell herself that she must have gotten lucky.\n\nShe could further tell herself that if the reason she persisted in\nbelieving F despite the altimeter reading was that she did in\nfact have low blood oxygen, then it was really lucky she had that\nhypoxia! Otherwise in evaluating her total evidence correctly she\nwould have come to a false belief that not-F. Reasoning so, the\npilot would be using her confidence in F as a reason to believe\nthe altimeter reading was a misleading defeater, which does not seem\nto be a good way of finding that out. Moreover, if she did this\nargument a number of times she could use the track record so formed to\nbootstrap her way to judging herself reliable after all (Christensen\n2007a,b; White 2009; Horowitz 2014\u2014for general discussion of\nwhat is wrong with bootstrapping, see Vogel 2000 and Cohen 2002).\nAkrasia also sanctions correspondingly odd betting behavior.\n\nTo the extent that New Rational Reflection (of the previous section)\ncalls for a match between first-order and second-order beliefs it\ncounts as a Non-Akrasia principle. However, this particular matching\nrequirement is subject to several problems about evidence that are\nbrought out by Lasonen-Aarnio (2015). It requires substantive\nassumptions about evidence and updating our beliefs that are not\nobvious, and does not appear to respect the internalism about\nrationality that apparently motivates it, namely that one\u2019s\nopinions about what states it is rational to be in match what states\none is actually in. Moreover it does not seem that New Rational\nReflection could embody the attractive idea that in general a subject\nmay rationally always be uncertain whether she is rational, i.e., even\nthe ideal agent can doubt that she is the ideal agent\u2014an idea\nthat RatRef failed to conform with and that led to the formulation of\nthis new principle. This is because New Rational Reflection must\nassume that some things, such as conditionalization, cannot be doubted\nto be rational, i.e., to be what the ideal agent would do. It is not\nclear that we should have expected that everything can be doubted at\nonce (Vickers 2000; Roush et al. 2012), but this is an ongoing area of\nresearch (Sliwa & Horowitz 2015).\n\nAnother problem some have seen with any version of Rational Reflection\nis that it ultimately doesn\u2019t allow the subject to remain unsure\nwhat degree of belief it is rational for her to have. It forces her to\nmatch her first-order degree of belief to a specific value, namely, a\nweighted average of the degrees of belief that she thinks it might be\nrational to have. It collapses her uncertainty about what is rational\nto a certainty about the average of the possibilities and forces her\nto embrace that precise value. This doesn\u2019t allow a kind of\nmismatch or akrasia that might be the right way to respond to some\nhigher-order evidence, where one is confident that q and also\nthinks it likely that the evidence supports a lower confidence than\none has but is unsure what that lower confidence should be. Maybe one\nshould not defer to the higher-order evidence in this case, because\none is not sure what its verdict is (Sliwa & Horowitz 2015). See\nthe higher-order calibration approach below for a way of representing\nthis uncertainty that can give a justification for thinking that\nmatching to averages is rational.\n\nThe evidential approach locates the authority that second-order\ninformation about our judgment has over us in the idea that it is\nevidence and we should respect our evidence. A state of self-doubt on\nthis view is confidence both that q and that one\u2019s\nevidence may well not support q. This state does not make the\nsubject inconsistent, but is a state of level-splitting or akrasia.\nMatching on this view is constituted by agreement between one\u2019s\nlevel of confidence in q and how far one thinks one\u2019s\nevidence supports q, and doesn\u2019t allow akrasia, but\ntaking an evidential approach does not by itself settle whether\nrationality requires matching, or under what circumstances first- or\nsecond-order evidence should determine one\u2019s first order\nconfidence. General rules about how to adjudicate in self-doubting\ncases between the claims of the two orders of evidence may be hard to\nget due to paradoxes, and to the need in every instance to hold some\nfeatures of rationality as undoubtable in order to initiate and\nresolve one\u2019s doubt.\n",
