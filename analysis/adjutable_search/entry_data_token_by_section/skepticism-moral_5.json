    "main_text": "Arguments for Moral Skepticism || Skeptical Hypotheses\n3.4 Skeptical Hypotheses\n\n\nThe final kind of argument derives from Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n(1641). I do not seem justified in believing that what I see is a\nlake if I cannot rule out the possibility that it is a bay or a\nbayou.  Generalizing, if there is any contrary hypothesis that I\ncannot rule out, then I am not justified in believing that what I see\nis a lake.  This is supposed to be a common standard for justified\nbelief. When this principle is applied thoroughly, it leads to\nskepticism. All a skeptic needs to show is that, for each belief,\nthere is some contrary hypothesis that cannot be ruled out. It need\nnot be the same hypothesis for every belief, but skeptics usually buy\nwholesale instead of retail, so they seek a single hypothesis that is\ncontrary to all (or many common) beliefs and which cannot be ruled\nout in any way.\n\n\nThe famous Cartesian hypothesis is of a demon who deceives me in all\nof my beliefs about the external world, while also ensuring that my\nbeliefs are completely coherent. This possibility cannot be ruled out\nby any experiences or beliefs, because of how the deceiving demon is\ndefined. This hypothesis is also contrary to my beliefs about the\nlake.  So my beliefs about the lake are not justified, according to\nthe above principle. And there is nothing special about my beliefs\nabout the lake. Everything I believe about the external world is\nincompatible with the deceiving demon hypothesis. Skeptics conclude\nthat no such belief is justified.\n\n\nThis argument is often dismissed on the grounds that there is no\nreason to believe in a deceiving demon or that nobody really doubts\nwhether there is an external world. In contrast, this form of argument is not subject to such objections when it is applied to morality, because some people really do\nadopt and even argue for a parallel skeptical hypothesis in\nmorality:\n\n Moral Nihilism = Nothing is morally wrong.\n\n\n\nMoral nihilism here is not about what is semantically or\nmetaphysically possible. It is just a substantive, negative,\nexistential claim that there does not exist anything that is morally\nwrong. It is, however, usually supplemented with an explanation of why\npeople hold moral beliefs that are false (just as the story of\nDescartes\u2019s deceiving demon is supposed to explain why our perceptual\nbeliefs are false). This thesis of moral nihilism has been supported\nby various reasons, including the pervasiveness of moral disagreement\nand our supposed ability (with the help of sociobiology and other\nsciences) to explain moral beliefs without reference to moral\nfacts. Since people do take moral nihilism seriously and even argue\nfor it (Mackie 1977, Joyce 2001), moral nihilism cannot be dismissed\nas readily as Descartes\u2019s deceiving demon.\n\n\nMoral skeptics can then argue that the definition of moral nihilism\nforestalls any refutation. Since moral nihilists question all of our\nbeliefs in moral wrongness, they leave us with no starting points on\nwhich to base arguments against them without begging the question at\nissue. Moreover, moral nihilists\u2019 explanations of our moral beliefs\npredict that we would hold exactly these moral beliefs, so the truth\nof its predictions can hardly refute moral nihilism. If this trick\nworks, then it fits right into a skeptical hypothesis argument.\n\n\nThis argument is clearest when applied to an example. If nothing is\nmorally wrong, as moral nihilists claim, then it is not morally wrong\nto torture babies just for fun. So, according to the general principle\nabove, one must be able to rule out moral nihilism in order to be\njustified in believing that torturing babies just for fun is morally\nwrong. Moral skeptics conclude that this moral belief is not\njustified. More precisely:\n\n\n(1) I am not justified in believing the denial of moral nihilism.\n\n\n(2) I am justified in believing that [(p) \u201cIt is morally wrong\nto torture babies just for fun\u201d entails (q) the denial of\nmoral nihilism].\n\n\n(3) If I am justified in believing that p, and I am justified\nin believing that p entails q, then I am justified\nin believing that q.\n\n\n(4) Therefore, I am not justified in believing that it is morally\nwrong to torture babies just for fun.\n\n\n\nThis moral belief is not especially problematic in any way. It seems\nas obvious as any moral belief. So the argument can be generalized to\ncover any moral belief. Moral skeptics conclude that no moral belief\nis justified.\n\n\nThere are two main responses to such skeptical hypothesis arguments\n(cf. May 2013).  First, some anti-skeptics deny (1) and claim that\nskeptical hypotheses can be ruled out somehow. They might argue that\nmoral nihilism is internally inconsistent or meaningless. If so, it\ncan be ruled out by logic and semantics alone. However, moral nihilism\ndoes seem consistent and meaningful, according to all plausible\ntheories of moral language, including expressivism, realism, and\nconstructivism (Sinnott-Armstrong 2006, chap. 3). Moral nihilism is\nalso not subject to the kind of argument that Putnam (1981) deploys\nagainst more general skeptical scenarios. Anti-skeptics still might\nargue that moral nihilism is incompatible with some non-moral facts or\nobservations or their best explanations. If so, it can be ruled out by\narguments with only non-moral premises. However, all such attempts to\ncross the dreaded is-ought gap are questionable (Sinnott-Armstrong\n2006, chaps. 7\u20138). A third way to rule out moral nihilism would be\nbased on common moral beliefs that are incompatible with moral\nnihilism. However, just as it would beg the question to use common\nbeliefs about the external world to rule out a deceiving demon\nhypothesis, so it would also beg the question to argue against moral\nnihilism on the basis of common moral beliefs \u2014 no matter how\nobvious those beliefs might seem to us, and no matter how well these\ncommon beliefs cohere together (Sinnott-Armstrong 2006,\nchaps. 9\u201310). Moral skeptics conclude that there is no way to rule out\nmoral nihilism, just as premise (1) claims.\n\n\nAnother recent response is to deny premise (3). This is a principle of\nclosure. Since a belief entails the denial of every contrary\nhypothesis, this closure principle in effect says that I cannot be\njustified in believing p unless I am justified in denying\nevery hypothesis contrary to p \u2014 that is, unless I can\nrule out all contrary hypotheses. This principle has been\ndenied by relevant alternative theorists, who claim instead that only\nrelevant hypotheses need to be ruled out. On this theory, if skeptical\nhypotheses are not relevant, then a belief that it is morally wrong to\ntorture babies just for fun can be justified, even if the believer\ncannot rule out moral nihilism.\n\n\nFor this response to have force, however, opponents of moral\nskepticism need to say why moral nihilism is irrelevant. It seems\nrelevant, for the simple reason that it is directly contrary to the\nmoral belief that is supposed to be justified. Moreover, real people\nbelieve and give reasons to believe in moral nihilism. Some people are\nled to moral nihilism by the absence of any defensible theory of\nmorality. If consequentialism is absurd or incoherent, as some critics\nargue, and if deontological restrictions and permissions are\nmysterious and unfounded, as their opponents argue, then some people\nmight believe moral nihilism for reasons similar to those that led\nscientists to reject phlogiston. Another basis for moral nihilism\ncites science. If all of our moral beliefs can be explained by\nsociobiology and/or other social sciences without assuming that any\nmoral belief is true, then some might accept moral nihilism for\nreasons similar to those that lead many people to reject witches or\nelves. The point is not that such reasons for moral nihilism are\nadequate. The point here is only that there is enough prima facie\nreason to believe moral nihilism that it cannot be dismissed as\nirrelevant on this basis. If moral nihilism is relevant, and if\nclosure holds for all or at least relevant alternatives, and if moral\nnihilism cannot be ruled out in any way, then moral skepticism seems\nto follow.\n",
