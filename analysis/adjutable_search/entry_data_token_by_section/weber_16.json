    "main_text": "Politics and Ethics || Conviction and Responsibility\n6.3 Conviction and Responsibility\n\nWhat are, then, these two ethics of conviction and responsibility\nexactly that Weber wanted to foster through a\n\u201c\u2018chronic\u2019 political schooling\u201d\n[Weber 1894/1994, 26]. According to the ethic of responsibility, on\nthe one hand, an action is given meaning only as a cause of an effect,\nthat is, only in terms of its causal relationship to the empirical\nworld. The virtue lies in an objective understanding of the possible\ncausal effect of an action and the calculated reorientation of the\nelements of an action in such a way as to achieve a desired\nconsequence. An ethical question is thereby reduced to a question of\ntechnically correct procedure, and free action consists of choosing\nthe correct means. By emphasizing the causality to which a free agent\nsubscribes, in short, Weber prescribes an ethical integrity between\naction and consequences, instead of a Kantian emphasis on that between\naction and intention.\n\nAccording to the ethic of conviction, on the other hand, a free agent\nshould be able to choose autonomously not only the means, but also the\nend; \u201cthis concept of personality finds its\n\u2018essence\u2019 in the constancy of its inner relation to\ncertain ultimate \u2018values\u2019 and \u2018meanings\u2019 of\nlife\u201d [Weber 1903\u201306/1975, 192]. In this respect,\nWeber\u2019s central problem arises from the recognition that the\nkind of rationality applied in choosing a means cannot be used in\nchoosing an end. These two kinds of reasoning represent categorically\ndistinct modes of rationality, a boundary further reinforced by modern\nvalue fragmentation. With no objectively ascertainable ground of\nchoice provided, then, a free agent has to create purpose ex nihilo:\n\u201cultimately life as a whole, if it is not to be permitted to run\non as an event in nature but is instead to be consciously guided, is a\nseries of ultimate decisions through which the soul \u2013 as in\nPlato \u2013 chooses its own fate\u201d [Weber 1917/1949, 18]. This\nultimate decision and the Kantian integrity between intention and\naction constitute the essence of what Weber calls an ethic of\nconviction.\n\nIt is often held that the gulf between these two types of ethics is\nunbridgeable for Weber. Demanding an unmitigated integrity between\none\u2019s ultimate value and political action, that is to say, the\ndeontological ethic of conviction cannot be reconciled with\nthat of responsibility which is consequentialist in essence.\nIn fact, Weber himself admitted the \u201cabysmal contrast\u201d\nthat separates the two. This frank admission, nevertheless, cannot be\ntaken to mean that he privileged the latter over the former as far as\npolitical education is concerned.\n\nWeber keenly recognized the deep tension between consequentialism and\ndeontology, but he still insisted that they should be forcefully\nbrought together. The former recognition only lends urgency to the\nlatter agenda. Resolving this analytical inconsistency in terms of\ncertain \u201cethical decrees\u201d did not interest Weber. Instead,\nhe sought for a moral character that can manage this\n\u201ccombination\u201d with a sheer force of will. In fact, he also\ncalled this synthetic ethic as that of responsibility without clearly\ndistinguishing it from the merely consequentialist ethic it sought to\novercome, thus creating an interpretive debate that continues to this\nday [de Villiers 2018, 47\u201378]. Be that as it may, his advocacy\nfor this willful synthesis is incontrovertible, and he called such an\nethical character a \u201cpolitician with a sense of vocation\u201d\n(Berufspolitiker) who combines a passionate conviction in\nsupra-mundane ideals that politics has to serve and a sober rational\ncalculation of its realizability in this mundane world. Weber thus\nconcluded: \u201cthe ethic of conviction and the ethic of\nresponsibility are not absolute opposites. They are complementary to\none another, and only in combination do they produce the true human\nbeing who is capable of having a \u2018vocation for\npolitics\u2019\u201d [Weber 1919/1994, 368].\n\nThis synthetic political virtue seems not only hard to achieve, but\nalso without a promise of felicitous ending. Weber\u2019s synthesis\ndemands a sober confrontation with the reality of politics, i.e., the\never-presence of \u201cphysical forces\u201d and all the unintended\nconsequences or collateral damages that come with the use of coercion.\nOnly then may it be brought under ethical control by a superhuman\ndeployment of passion and prudence, but, even so, Weber\u2019s\npolitical superhuman (\u00dcbermensch) cannot circumvent the\nso-called \u201cdirty-hands dilemma\u201d [cf. Walzer 1973; Coady\n2009]. For, even at the moment of triumph, the unrelenting grip of\nresponsibility would never let him or her disavow the guilt and\nremorse for having employed the \u201cphysical forces,\u201d no\nmatter how beneficial or necessary. It is a tragic-heroic ethic of\n\u201cnevertheless (dennoch)\u201d [see 2.2] and, as such,\nWeber\u2019s \u201ctragicism\u201d goes beyond politics [Honigsheim\n2013, 115]. Science as a Vocation is a self-evident case in\nwhich the virtue of \u201cvalue freedom\u201d demands a scientist to\nconfront the modern epistemological predicament of incommensurable\nvalue-fragmentation without succumbing to the nihilistic plethora of\nsubjective values by means of a disciplined and willful devotion to\nthe scholarly specialization and scientific objectivity [see 5.2].\nFrom this ethical vintage point, The Protestant Ethic and the\nSpirit of Capitalism may as well be re-titled Labour\nas a Vocation. It was in this much earlier work\n(1904\u20135) that Weber first outlined the basic contours of the\nethic of vocation (Berufsethik) and a person of vocation\n(Berufsmensch) and the way those work practices emerged\nhistorically in the course of the Reformation (and faded away\nsubsequently). The Calvinist doctrine of predestination has amplified\nthe innermost anxiety over one\u2019s own salvation, but such a\nsubjective fear and trembling was channeled into a psychological\nreservoir for the most disciplined and methodical life conduct\n(Lenbensf\u00fchrung), or labour in calling, that created the\n\u201cspirit\u201d of capitalism. Paradoxically combining subjective\nvalue commitments and objective rationality in the pursuit of those\ngoals, in short, the making and unmaking of the Berufsmensch\nis where Weber\u2019s ethical preoccupations in politics, science,\nand economy converge [cf. Hennis 1988].\n\nIn the end, Weber\u2019s project is not about formal analysis of\nmoral maxims, nor is it about substantive virtues that reflect some\nkind of ontic telos. It is too formal or empty to be an Aristotelean\nvirtue ethics, and it is too concerned with moral character to be a\nKantian deontology narrowly understood. The goal of Weber\u2019s\nethical project, rather, aims at cultivating a character who can\nwillfully bring together these conflicting formal virtues to create\nwhat he calls a \u201ctotal personality\u201d\n(Gesamtpers\u00f6nlichkeit). It culminates in an ethical\ncharacterology or philosophical anthropology in which passion and\nreason are properly ordered by sheer force of individual will. As\nsuch, Weber\u2019s political virtue resides not simply in a\nsubjective intensity of value commitment nor in a detached\nintellectual integrity and methodical purposefulness, but in their\nwillful combination in a unified soul. In this abiding preoccupation\nwith statecraft-cum-soulcraft, Weber was a moralist and\npolitical educator who squarely belonged to the venerable tradition\nthat stretches back to the ancient Greeks down to Rousseau, Hegel, and\nMill.\n",
