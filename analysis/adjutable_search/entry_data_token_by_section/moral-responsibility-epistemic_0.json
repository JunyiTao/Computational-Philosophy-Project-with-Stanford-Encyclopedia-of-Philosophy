    "main_text": "The Epistemic Condition || Contents of Awareness\n1.1 Contents of Awareness\n\nWe can start with this intuitive thought: for an agent to be\npraise-/blameworthy for an action, she must be aware of certain\nthings. Thus, what the EC seems to require, at least initially, is\nawareness. As we will see, the debate revolves around three main\nissues. First, what the content of the requisite awareness\nis, i.e., of which things an agent needs to be aware of. Second, what\nkind of awareness is required, i.e., which mental states are\ninvolved and in what way these mental states must be entertained.\nThird, whether awareness is actually required at all or whether there\ncan be, in Sher\u2019s (2009) phrase, \u201cresponsibility without\nawareness\u201d. For the moment we can bracket the third question and\npursue the intuitive thought that responsibility does require\nawareness. In this subsection we focus on the question about the\ncontent of awareness and in the next one on the question about the\nkind of awareness relevant for moral responsibility.\n\nImagine that John presses a wall button that activates a treadmill in\nwhich Mary is standing still, causing her to fall to the ground and\nbreak an arm. Let\u2019s assume that the action is objectively wrong,\nsince it harmed Mary for no good reason, e.g., to save her from an\nincoming bullet. Now let\u2019s try to determine what it would take\nfor John to be blameworthy for it. Assume first that John satisfies\nall non-epistemic conditions on moral responsibility, like possessing\nwhatever kind of freedom/control is required for blameworthiness. Now\nask: of which things must John be aware at the time of action in order\nto be blameworthy for it and for the ensuing consequences? There are\nfour plausible epistemic requirements involved: awareness of action,\nof moral significance, of consequences, and of alternatives.\nWe\u2019ll take them in turn.\n\nFirst, the requirement of awareness of action (Mele 2010;\nSliwa 2017). To be responsible for his action, John must be aware of\nwhat he is doing. If John falsely believes that the button is a light\nswitch, then he isn\u2019t aware that by pressing it he will start\nthe treadmill and so it seems that he can\u2019t be blamed for\nMary\u2019s fall and for her injuries. Similarly, if John correctly\nbelieves that pressing the button will start the treadmill but\nisn\u2019t aware that Mary is standing on it, it seems that he\nisn\u2019t blameworthy either. These seemings have to be refined, of\ncourse, since John\u2019s ignorance of the button\u2019s function or\nof Mary\u2019s location can itself be blameworthy, in which case\n(most think) it fails to exculpate (Ginet 2000: 271). (For the classic\ndiscussion of what it takes for ignorance to be culpable see Holly\nSmith 1983 and\n sect. 2\n below. For discussions of whether culpable ignorance excuses, see\nHolly Smith 1983 and 2017; Montmarquet 1995.) The lesson, then, is\nthat for an agent to be directly blameworthy for an\naction\u2014that is, blameworthy in a way that doesn\u2019t derive\nfrom previous instances of blameworthiness, such as culpability for\nthe ignorance from which she acts\u2014she must be aware that she is\nperforming the action in question, and be aware of it under an\nappropriate description (Anscombe 1963; Levy 2014: 37). In this case,\nJohn must be aware that by pressing the button he is activating the\ntreadmill with Mary on it or, alternatively, that by pressing the\nbutton and activating the treadmill he is causing Mary to fall to the\nground. (Recall that this is just a first pass on the epistemic\nrequirements on responsibility. We\u2019ll see later on\n (sect. 3.4)\n that many philosophers deny that one must be aware of what one is\ndoing in order to be directly responsible for it.)\n\nSecond, the requirement of awareness of moral significance.\nFor John to be blameworthy, he has to be aware of the action\u2019s\nmoral significance or moral valence. In other words, he must have a\nbelief about the action\u2019s being wrong or, alternatively, a\nbelief about the presence of whatever features make the action wrong\n(its wrong-making features). The first kind of belief amounts to\nde dicto awareness of moral significance, because it involves\nawareness of the action\u2019s wrongness so conceived (Haji\n1997: 543; Zimmerman 2002a; 2008: 191\u20132; 2017: 85; Rosen 2004:\n307; Levy 2011: 141; Sliwa 2017: 131\u20132). The second kind of\nbelief amounts to de re awareness of moral significance,\nbecause it involves awareness of those features of the action that are\nin fact morally significant, regardless of whether the agent\nis also aware of the moral significance they actually have\n(Harman 2011: 465; 2015: 59\u201360, 67; Talbert 2013: 242;\nLittlejohn 2014: 144; Levy 2014: 37). If when John presses the button\nhe entertains the belief that what he is doing is overall morally\nwrong, he has de dicto awareness of the action\u2019s moral\nsignificance. (If, alternatively, he believes that his action is\nmerely pro tanto morally wrong but not wrong\nall-things-considered, he lacks that awareness.) If, on the other\nhand, John lacks the belief about overall wrongness but has other\nbeliefs about the action\u2019s wrong-making features, e.g., that it\nwill harm Mary, he has de re awareness of the action\u2019s\nmoral significance. The position according to which the relevant\nawareness is de dicto awareness entails that moral knowledge\n(or at least moral beliefs) is necessary for responsibility (Sliwa\n2017), whereas the position according to which the relevant awareness\nis de re awareness denies the necessity of moral knowledge\n(Harman 2011 & 2015; Talbert 2013; Weatherson 2019: ch. 5).\nWe\u2019ll see below\n (sect. 3.3)\n that this is a key dispute concerning the epistemic requirements on\npraise-/blameworthiness.\n\nThird, the requirement of awareness of consequences. In a\nnatural description of the case, we would say that John is responsible\nfor Mary\u2019s breaking an arm, that is, that he\u2019s blameworthy\nfor the latter\n event.[2]\n Call this the consequence of John\u2019s action. What kind of\nawareness is required for John to be blameworthy for it? The\nstraightforward response is that he must have a belief about the event\noccurring as a result of his action (Zimmerman 1997: 420). However,\nthere is disagreement about what the content of this belief must be.\nSome philosophers (Zimmerman 1986; Vargas 2005) think that it must be\nvery specific, in the sense that the agent has to believe that an\nevent of exactly the kind that occurred could result from her\naction, whereas others (Fischer & Tognazzini 2009; King 2017: 272;\nNelkin & Rickless 2017a: 126) think that a belief with a more\ngeneral content suffices. According to the former position, for John\nto be blameworthy for the consequence of his action he must have\nentertained the belief that Mary would (or might) break her arm as a\nresult of her fall, whereas according to the latter position a belief\nthat someone would (or might) be harmed is enough. It\u2019s worth\nnoting that the requirement of awareness of consequences is usually\nstated in terms of \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d rather than\nactual foresight (Vargas 2005; Fischer & Tognazzini 2009; Sartorio\n2017; cf. Zimmerman 1986; Nelkin & Rickless 2017a). As will become\npatent later on, the dispute about how to understand this requirement\nis part and parcel of the broader dispute about whether the EC\nrequires occurrent awareness\n (sect. 2)\n or, rather, the capacity to gain the requisite awareness (sects.\n 3.2,\n 3.4).\n\nFourth and finally, the requirement of awareness of\nalternatives. Some philosophers argue that an agent can\u2019t\nbe blameworthy for a wrong action unless she believes that there is at\nleast one alternative (and permissible) course of action open to her.\nFor instance, Levy writes (see also Wieland 2017a: 2; Guerrero 2007:\n89):\n\n\nPerhaps it need not be the case \u2026 that agents need genuine\naccess to alternative possibilities when they choose and act, but they\ndo need epistemic access to a range of alternatives: they can\nonly appropriately be blamed for performing an action if they believed\nthat alternatives were available to them, and understood the\nsignificance of these alternatives. (Levy 2011: 111)\n\n\nApplying this idea to our example, John would be blameworthy only if\nhe believed that he could have pursued an alternative and permissible\ncourse of action, such as refraining from pressing the button.\nHowever, not everyone agrees that this is a genuine epistemic\nrequirement on responsibility. For instance, Sartorio (2017)\nargues\u2014on the basis of a variation on the classic Frankfurt\ncases (Frankfurt 1969)\u2014that an agent can be blameworthy even if\nshe believes, or even knows, that she couldn\u2019t have\ndone otherwise, as long as this belief doesn\u2019t interfere with\nher own deliberation about whether to perform the wrong action.\n\nIn sum, there are four different things awareness of which seems (at\nleast initially) relevant for responsibility: awareness of one\u2019s\naction under an appropriate description, of its moral significance, of\nits potential consequences, and of alternatives to it. Next\nwe\u2019ll consider different positions about what mental states\namount to the requisite awareness.\n",
