    "main_text": "Physical Computability || The Physical Church-Turing Thesis: Modest\n4.2 The Physical Church-Turing Thesis: Modest\n\nIn the literature on computation in physical systems, there is growing\nconcern that a physical analogue of Mathematical CTT should include\nonly usable physical processes (e.g., N\u00e9meti and\nD\u00e1vid 2006; Ord 2006, Smith 2006a, Beggs and Tucker 2007).\nGiven this concern, an adequate version of Physical CTT ought to be\nmore modest than Bold Physical CTT.\n\nModest Physical CTT is thus formulated in terms of what can be\nphysically computed\u2014more precisely, which functions over a\ndenumerable domain can be physically computed. Prototypical examples\nof physical computation are the processes of ordinary digital\ncomputers and their components, including digital circuits. These\nprocesses can be exhaustively described by effective procedures, which\nare already covered by Mathematical CTT, plus relatively\nuncontroversial mappings between physical states and computational\nstates. Mathematical CTT says that any function computable by an\neffective procedure is computable by a TM. As TMs can be physically\nimplemented (or replaced by a computing human), any process that\nfollows an effective procedure is physically computable.\n\nBut physical computation in the present sense is a broader notion than\ncomputation by effective procedure. A process may count as a physical\ncomputation even if there is no effective procedure for describing the\nprocess, perhaps because there are no finite instantaneous\ndescriptions of the internal states that constitute the process or no\nway to finitely and exactly specify the transition from one\ninstantaneous description to the next. Thus, Modest Physical CTT is\nstronger than Mathematical CTT.\n\nGandy (1980) was one of the first to discuss a version of Modest\nPhysical CTT, arguing that mechanisms with discrete components and\nreasonable physical limitations (a lower bound on the size of\ncomponents, and an upper bound on the speed of their kinematics) can\nonly physically compute Turing-computable functions. However, Modest\nPhysical CTT need not be limited in these ways. In addition to\nphysical processes that follow effective procedures, Modest Physical\nCTT may cover continuous dynamical processes (as in certain kinds of\nneural networks), processes that span large portions of spacetime, and\nquantum processes (as in quantum computing). But physical computation\ndoes not include all physical processes.\n\nIn accordance with this proposal, Modest Physical CTT holds\nthat any function (of a denumerable domain) that is physically\ncomputable is Turing-computable.\n\nFor a process to count as a physical computation, and hence for it to\nbe relevant to Modest Physical CTT, it must be usable by an observer\nto generate the desired values of an independently specified function.\nThis requirement may be spelled out in terms of a number of\nconstraints (Piccinini 2015, Chaps 15 and 16). This list is not\nintended to be exhaustive:\n\nReadable inputs and outputs. The process must take inputs and\nyield outputs that observers can read without error, so that observers\ncan use the outputs as solutions to problems or values of functions\ndefined over the inputs. For that to be possible, presumably the\ninputs and outputs need to be reducible to strings of discrete states,\nlike the inputs and outputs of ordinary digital computers.\nProcess-independent rule. There must be a fixed rule or\nmap\u2014specifiable independently of the physical process\u2014that\nlinks the outputs to the inputs. By defining the problem to be solved\nby the process, this rule tells the user what she is going to learn by\nrunning the process. Since the rule defines a physical computation in\ngeneral, the rule need not be recursive. For instance, it may be the\nrule that defines the halting problem for TMs. But like all recursive\nrules, the rule must be the same for all inputs that belong in the\nsame problem; it cannot change from one input to the next.\nRepeatability. The process must be repeatable, at least in\nprinciple, so as to allow users to obtain the same results multiple\ntimes and to check a computation by repeating it.\nSettability. The system undergoing the process must be settable,\nso that a user can choose which argument of a function the system\ncomputes and set the system to compute the relevant value of the\nfunction.\nPhysical constructibility. The system must be physically\nconstructible.\nReliability. The system must not break down before the process is\ncompleted.\n\n\nIn summary, Modest Physical CTT asserts that every function that can\nbe physically computed, i.e., every usable transformation of input\nstrings into output strings in accordance with a process-independent\nrule defined over the strings, is Turing-computable.\n\nSince Modest Physical CTT is restricted by epistemologically relevant\ncriteria, it doesn\u2019t raise the worries associated with Bold Physical\nCTT\u2014namely, that it\u2019s too easy to falsify and irrelevant to the\nnotion of computability that motivates CTT. And there are good reasons\nto believe Modest Physical CTT. All computing mechanisms that have\nbeen physically built or are in the process of being built to compute\nfunctions of a denumerable domain compute only functions that are\nTuring-computable.\n\nIt is important to understand the exact scope of Modest Physical CTT.\nModest Physical CTT does not entail that every physical process is a\ncomputation, or that every physical system is a computing system. It\nonly says that if something physical computes functions of a\ndenumerable domain, then the functions it computes are\nTuring-computable.\n\nTo fully assess Modest Physical CTT, we should consider whether it is\npossible to build a machine that, like an ordinary digital computer,\ncan be used by human observers, but, unlike an ordinary digital\ncomputer, generates the values of functions that are\nTuring-uncomputable. In recent years, several designs for\nhypercomputation have been proposed. Hypercomputation is the\ncomputation of Turing-uncomputable functions. If hypercomputation\nturned out to be physically possible, it would refute Modest Physical\nCTT.\n",
