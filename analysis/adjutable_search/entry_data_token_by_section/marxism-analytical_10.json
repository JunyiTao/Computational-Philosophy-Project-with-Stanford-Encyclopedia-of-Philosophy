    "main_text": "Content || Exploitation\n4.4 Exploitation\n\nExploitation is a highly contested concept. This section is intended\nonly to introduce some aspects of its treatment by analytical Marxism,\nand not to rule out alternative usages.\n\nThe basic concept of exploitation involves some agent benefitting from\nsocial interaction with another by taking advantage of that other,\nsometimes (interestingly) in ways that are both mutually beneficial\nand consensual (A. Wood 1995: 151). Of course, not all kinds of\n\u201ctaking advantage\u201d are morally problematic. To give a\nstandard example: there may be nothing wrong with a chess grandmaster\nexploiting a weakness in their opponent\u2019s endgame. Consequently,\nwe might want to avoid \u201cmoralised\u201d definitions of\n\u201cexploitation\u201d which make it wrongful or unjust by\ndefinition. That said, cases of \u201cwrongful exploitation\u201d\nare of particular significance in the Marxist tradition, often being\ntreated as providing a reason for seeking to replace capitalist\neconomic arrangements with non-exploitative alternatives.\n\nMarxist claims about exploitation are often said\u2014by both\nMarxists and their critics\u2014to depend on the labour theory of\nvalue. This is denied by Cohen who, in a well-known article, argues\nthat the relation between the two, despite their long historical\nassociation, is one of mutual irrelevance (1988: 209). The labour\ntheory of value is understood here as a theory of equilibrium price,\nwhose central claim is that magnitude of value is determined by\nsocially necessary labour time. Cohen suggests that those Marxists who\nhave insisted on the labour theory as the basis of exploitation have\nconfused the idea of producers creating value with the idea of\nproducers creating that which has value (the product). This latter,\nsomewhat simpler, idea is the real basis of the charge of\nexploitation. What matters for exploitation is not that capitalists\nappropriate value created by workers, but rather that they appropriate\n(part of) the value of what the worker produces.\n\nIn the place of arguments that make exploitation claims depend on the\nlabour theory of value, Cohen endorses the \u201cPlain\nArgument\u201d (1988: 228):\n\nThe labourer is the person who creates the product, that which has\nvalue.\nThe capitalist appropriates some of the value of the product.\nThe labourer receives less value than the value of what she\ncreates,\n\n\nand\n\nThe capitalist appropriates some of the value of what the labourer\ncreates.\nThe labourer is exploited by the capitalist.\n\n\nIt is this Plain Argument which is said typically to motivate\nMarxists, whatever their official view of the labour theory of\nvalue.\n\nNote that the claim that the capitalist appropriates part of the value\nof the worker\u2019s product (step 4) is not (as it stands) a\nnormative one. For that appropriation to constitute wrongful\nexploitation the normative dimensions of the step from 4 to 5 in the\nPlain Argument would need to be fleshed out. The present section\noutlines three candidate explanations of the relevant\nwrongfulness\u2014involving the ideas of unfairness,\ninstrumentalising vulnerability, and domination,\nrespectively\u2014which have found support within analytical\nMarxism.\n\nThe first, and best-known, analytical Marxist account maintains that\nwrongful exploitation rests on the capitalist benefitting from prior\nunfairness, in particular, benefitting from the injustice of\nproperty relations. (This account is associated with Roemer, amongst\nothers, but note that many additional issues raised by the\nlatter\u2019s innovative work on exploitation\u2014for instance, his\naccount of socialist exploitation resting on unequal ownership of\nproductive skills\u2014are not discussed here (see Roemer 1982, 1986b,\n1986c, 1988).)\n\nRoemer develops a general theory of exploitation;\n\u201cgeneral\u201d, not least, in aiming to capture both Marxist\nand neoclassical accounts within the same framework. He proposes that\na group is exploited \u201cif it has some conditionally feasible\nalternative under which its members would be better off\u201d (1986c:\n103). Formally this involves specifying a game played by coalitions of\nagents in an economy, and specifying payoffs if they withdraw.\n\nWe can say that capitalist exploitation obtains when capitalists are\nmade better off by the existence of workers, but workers are made\nworse off by the existence of capitalists (Roemer 1996: 40). More\nprecisely, capitalists exploit workers if and only if the following\nthree conditions obtain. First, if workers were to withdraw from the\nsociety, endowed with their per capita share of society\u2019s\nalienable property (including means of production) then workers would\nbe better off (in terms of income and leisure) than they are at the\npresent allocation. Second, if capitalists were to withdraw under the\nsame conditions, then capitalists would be worse off (in terms of\nincome and leisure) than they are at present (because some of their\ncurrent share would go to workers). Third, if workers were to withdraw\nfrom society with their own endowments (not their per capita share),\nthen capitalists would be worse off than at present (because they\nwould no longer be able to benefit from the workers\u2019\nlabour).\n\nFor Roemer, exploitation as such is not morally\nobjectionable. In an adjacent context (1988: 129\u2013130), he\ndescribes a two-person economy where a fair initial distribution of\nresources, but differing preferences for work and leisure: X\nprefers to work hard and defer consumption while Y prefers\nleisure and immediate consumption, which results in X being\nable to hire Y under conditions such that (a) X is made\nbetter off by this arrangement, (b) Y is not made worse off by\nthis arrangement; (c) Y could have freely chosen not to enter\ninto this arrangement; and (d) Y is exploited by X in\nthat X appropriates some of the labour time of Y. In\nexamples like these, Roemer maintains, exploitation exists but does\nnot appear morally objectionable or unjust.\n\nFor Roemer, exploitation is best understood as the distributive result\nof inequalities in the distribution of productive assets and\nresources. It is unjust only where it results from a prior\ninjustice in the underlying distribution of those assets and resources\n(Roemer 1996: 96). He consequently recommends that Marxists should\ndrop their traditional focus on the micro level of the relationship\nbetween classes in production, and attend rather to the macro level of\nthe distribution of property in society. It is unjust\ndistribution\u2014specifically, the unjust capitalist monopoly of\neffective control of the means of production\u2014that generates (the\nsecondary phenomenon of) unjust capitalist exploitation, and which\nshould be the primary locus of any normative concern.\n\nOne critical concern about this account is that, although the existing\ncapitalist monopoly over the means of production may have come about\nin a morally problematic way (not least, through violence and theft),\nwe can at least imagine (perhaps having read Nozick 1974) a capitalism\nwith a morally clean origin story, where the same inequalities emerge\nfrom a just starting point and just subsequent steps (involving,\nperhaps, voluntary choices and the right kind of luck). In such\ncircumstances, Roemer\u2019s three conditions might be met, but, on\nhis own account, there looks to be nothing wrongful about the result.\nThis might appear a surprising result in a Marxist account of\nexploitation, and is perhaps indicative of a wider problem.\n\nIn this context, consider the paradigmatic example of exploitation\nsuggested by Nicholas Vrousalis (2013: 148); namely \u201cthe pit\ncase\u201d:\n\n\nA finds B in a pit that B cannot exit unaided.\nA can get B out at little cost or difficulty. A\noffers to get B out, but only if B agrees to pay a\nmillion euros, or to sign a sweatshop contract with A. B\nsigns the contract.\n\n\nWe do not seem to require to know how B came to be in the\npit\u2014whether, for instance, it was through just or unjust\nsteps\u2014in order to assess the offer as wrongfully exploitative.\nIt seems enough to notice that A could easily rescue B\nwithout asking for anything, but instead takes advantage of\nB\u2019s vulnerability in order to improve their own lot\n(Vrousalis 2013: 149). By analogy, asset injustice does not look to be\na necessary condition for wrongful exploitation.\n\nA second analytical Marxist account maintains that wrongful\nexploitation rests on capitalists enriching themselves by taking\nadvantage of the vulnerability of workers. (This model is\nsuggested by some of Wood\u2019s writings on exploitation (see\nespecially 1995).)\n\nWood maintains that exploitation in general \u201cconsists in the\nexploiter\u201ds using something about the person for the\nexploiter\u2019s ends by playing on some weakness or vulnerability in\nthat person\u2019 (1995: 147). And he acknowledges that, so\nunderstood, exploitation is not always wrongful (as, for instance, in\ncases like the previously mentioned chess grandmaster).\n\nExploitation is wrongful, on this account, when exploiters enrich\nthemselves by taking advantage of the vulnerability of the exploited.\nThe wrongfulness here seems to involve the instrumental treatment of\nothers in ways which are humiliating or disrespectful. Wood maintains\nthat: \n\n\nProper respect for others is violated when we treat their\nvulnerabilities as opportunities to advance our own interests or\nprojects. It is degrading to have your weaknesses taken advantage of,\nand dishonourable to use the weakness of others for your ends. (1995:\n150\u2013151)\n\n\nThe relation between capitalist and worker would appear to exemplify\nthis account of wrongful exploitation. The vulnerability here arises\nfrom the workers\u2019 propertyless condition, which compels them to\nsell their labour power in terms advantageous to the capitalist. This\nstructural feature of the capitalist economy is not fundamentally\naltered, and only lightly mitigated, by the existence of some\ncollective bargaining and government regulation (A. Wood 1995:\n155). (Note that \u201cwrongful exploitation\u201d here might, or\nmight not, constitute an injustice on Wood\u2019s account.)\n\nOne critical concern about this pure vulnerability account is that it\nmight look too expansive; that is, it might look liable to indicate\nfalsely that exploitation is present in particular cases. It might,\nfor example, seem committed to the claim that a cancer doctor, who\nmakes a very comfortable living out of treating the seriously ill,\nnecessarily exploits their patients (Arneson 2016: 10). Those who\nhesitate to endorse that claim may seek to resist such\nimplications.\n\nA third analytical Marxist account treats the instrumentalization of\nvulnerability as a necessary but not sufficient condition for wrongful\nexploitation. The additional condition for exploitation to obtain is\nthat this instrumentalization of vulnerability occurs in a manner\nwhich involves domination. (This model is suggested in some of\nWood\u2019s writings on exploitation (1972, 2014), as well as in work by\nVrousalis (2013, 2016).)\n\nOn this domination account, it is the abuse of power that is the real\nwrong-making feature of exploitation; exploitation is paradigmatically\n\u201cdomination for self-enrichment\u201d (Vrousalis 2013: 131).\nThe relevant kind of domination obtains when the exploiter either\ninflicts some \u201cpower-induced injury\u201d to the status of the\nexploited, or imposes some \u201cservitude\u201d on the part of the\nexploited (Vrousalis 2016: 3). This refinement appears to address the\ncritical concern about the expansiveness of the pure vulnerability\naccount; for instance, domination looks to be missing in the case of\nthe cancer doctor and patient, but present in the relation between\nA and B in the case of the pit.\n\nTo be clear, the present account is intended to give some introductory\nsense of an ongoing debate about whether unfairness, the\ninstrumentalization of vulnerability, or domination, are at the heart\nof wrongful exploitation. There is no suggestion here that any\nconsensus about the precise character of exploitation has emerged\nwithin analytical Marxism.\n",
