    "main_text": "What is Computer Simulation? || A Narrow definition\n1.1 A Narrow definition\n\n\nIn its narrowest sense, a computer simulation is a program that is\nrun on a computer and that uses step-by-step methods to explore\nthe approximate behavior of a mathematical model. Usually this is\na model of a real-world system (although the system in question might\nbe an imaginary or hypothetical one). Such a computer program is\na computer simulation model. One run of the\nprogram on the computer is a computer simulation of the system. The\nalgorithm takes as its input a specification of the system\u2019s\nstate (the value of all of its variables) at some time t. \nIt then calculates the system\u2019s state at time t+1. \nFrom the values characterizing that second state, it then calculates\nthe system\u2019s state at time t+2, and so on. When\nrun on a computer, the algorithm thus produces a numerical picture of\nthe evolution of the system\u2019s state, as it is conceptualized in\nthe model. \n\n\nThis sequence of values for the model variables can be saved as a\nlarge collection of \u201cdata\u201d and is often viewed on a\ncomputer screen using methods of visualization. Often, but\ncertainly not always, the methods of visualization are designed to\nmimic the output of some scientific instrument\u2014so that the\nsimulation appears to be measuring a system of interest.\n\n\nSometimes the step-by-step methods of computer simulation are used\nbecause the model of interest contains continuous (differential)\nequations (which specify continuous rates of change in time) that\ncannot be solved analytically\u2014either in principle or perhaps only in\npractice. This underwrites the spirit of the following\ndefinition given by Paul Humphreys: \u201cany computer-implemented method\nfor exploring the properties of mathematical models where analytic\nmethods are not available\u201d (1991, 500). But even as a narrow\ndefinition, this one should be read carefully, and not be taken to\nsuggest that simulations are only used when there are analytically\nunsolvable equations in the model. Computer simulations are often\nused either because the original model itself contains discrete\nequations\u2014which can be directly implemented in an algorithm suitable\nfor simulation\u2014or because the original model consists of something\nbetter described as rules of evolution than as\nequations.\n\n\nIn the former case, when equations are being\n\u201cdiscretized\u201d (the turning of equations that describe\ncontinuous rates of change into discrete equations), it should be\nemphasized that, although it is common to speak of simulations\n\u201csolving\u201d those equations, a discretization can at best\nonly find something which approximates the solution of continuous\nequations, to some desired degree of accuracy. Finally,\nwhen speaking of \u201ca computer simulation\u201d in the narrowest\nsense, we should be speaking of a particular implementation of the\nalgorithm on a particular digital computer, written in a particular\nlanguage, using a particular compiler, etc. There are cases in\nwhich different results can be obtained as a result of variations in\nany of these particulars.\n",
