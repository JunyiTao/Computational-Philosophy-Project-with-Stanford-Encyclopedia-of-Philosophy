Carey says,\n\u201cwe cannot look to his work for an argument structured by\npremises and logical deductions\u201d (Carey 2006: 106). To\ncomplicate matters, Shaftesbury adopts different personae in different\nliterary performances, and there are significant interpretative\nquestions about the extent to which we ought to identify the views of\nShaftesbury\u2019s first-person narrators with Shaftesbury\nhimself\u2014especially when one persona explicitly distinguishes\nhimself from another (C 2.263 and 3.12; see Marshall 1986; Prince\n1996; Chaves 2008). In addition, some commentators take\nShaftesbury\u2019s works to be laced with self-distancing irony\n(Klein 1994: 96\u201399; Jaffro 2008). This diversity of forms,\nstyles, tones, and personae makes it difficult to attribute to\nShaftesbury a single philosophical system of thought. Shaftesbury\nhimself wrote: \u201cThe most ingenious way of becoming foolish, is\nby a System\u201d (C 1.290).\n\nAnother noteworthy feature of Shaftesbury interpretation is his use of\nillustrations. Shaftesbury worked on numerous allegorical\nillustrations for the second edition of Characteristics,\nputting tremendous effort into both the overall plan and the minute\ndetails of these illustrations and engaging in extensive\ncorrespondence with the artists he hired to execute the pictures. He\nseemed to want his audience to read the illustrations as carefully as\nthe words, their meanings (some readily apparent, others subtle to the\npoint of hiddenness) essential to a full understanding of the text.\n(The fullest discussion of the illustrations is Paknadel 1974. Rivers\n2000a and M\u00fcller 2010, 2012, and 2013 also shed light on how the\nillustrations interact with and enhance the message of\nShaftesbury\u2019s text.) Shaftesbury took care, as well, to compose\nthe marginal headings and index to Characteristicks, and his\nchoices in those places can also be cited as evidence for certain\ninterpretative views (see Rivers 2000b). Characteristicks was\none of the earliest books in English to have an index.\n\nYet another issue in Shaftesbury interpretation is the role to give to\nwritings not included in Characteristicks. These include\ncompleted works, unfinished versions of projected publications, and\ncorrespondence. Perhaps most important in this regard are\nShaftesbury\u2019s private notebooks, or Askemata (the\ndefinitive version is the Standard Edition; some of the\nwritings from the notebooks are also collected in Regimen,\nedited by Rand). There is a question, however, of whether\nAskemata and other unpublished writings constitute a more\naccurate picture of Shaftesbury\u2019s real views, or whether at\nleast some of those writings should be taken to have served private\ntherapeutic purposes that differ from the stating of his settled,\nfully considered positions. Shaftesbury has one of his narrators in\nCharacteristicks object to the publication of private\nruminations (C 1.162\u20134), and he himself did not intend for\nAskemata ever to be published.  Moreover, Jaffro has\nargued that Shaftesbury thought that the private self should be\n\u201csecreted\u201d from the public self\u2014that there should be\na \u201cgap\u201d between them (Jaffro 2008: 349)\u2014which only\ncomplicates further the attempt to corral everything Shaftesbury wrote\ninto a systematic, or even fully coherent, single philosophical\nposition.\n",
