    "main_text": "Further Contributions || Empirical Psychology\n9.3 Empirical Psychology\n\nStumpf\u2019s scientific contribution to the field of empirical\npsychology has been in recent years highlighted by several studies. In\naddition to the numerous studies that explore Stumpf\u2019s\nrelationship to psychologists such as K\u00fclpe (W. Baumgartner,\n1997), Herbart (M. Kaiser-El-Safti, 2009, 2010, 2011; S. Poggi, 2014),\nHelmholtz (H.-P. Reinecke, 2003) Wundt (U. Wolfradt, 2011), or to H.\nEbbinghaus (see U. Wolfradt & M. Kaiser-El-Safti (eds.), 2010),\nseveral other studies have highlighted Stumpf\u2019s diversified\ncontribution to several sub-disciplines of psychology, including the\npsychology of sound, Gestalt psychology, animal psychology, the\npsychology of child development, etc. Stumpf\u2019s most important\ncontribution in the field of psychology \u2013 understood in the\nnarrow sense of the science of psychical functions \u2013 is his\nPsychology of Sound published in two volumes.\n(Stumpf, 1883, 1890) The first volume deals with individual sound\njudgments while the second, dedicated to Brentano, studies the\nconsciousness of simultaneous sounds. According to his initial\nproposal, Stumpf\u2019s project was to write two more volumes. The\nthird was to focus on musical phenomena such as consonance,\ndissonance, accords, melodies, etc., while he had planned to study\nfeelings generated by sound (Tongef\u00fchle) in the fourth.\nPart of his research on these issues was published separately in his\nBeitr\u00e4ge zur Akustik und Musikwissenschaft (9\nvolumes).\n\nThis complex and unfinished work attracted much interest at the time\nand was reviewed by philosophers such as Meinong and Natorp and by\npsychologists such as J. Sully, H. Ebbinghaus, and especially W. Wundt\nwho, in his anonymous review of the first volume of the book,\ncriticized Stumpf\u2019s method and the hypothesis of the relativity\nof sensations to judgment. (see C. Allesch, 2003) Let us recall,\nhowever, that this book is not a phenomenological study of sounds but\nrather a study pertaining to \u201cjudgments about sounds,\u201d and\nit belongs therefore to the field of psychology in the narrow sense.\n(Stumpf, 1906a, p. 31) Stumpf makes it clear, however, that the\njudgment in question is not categorical but it is a judgment of a\nparticular type which he calls apprehension or apperception. Stumpf\nclaims moreover that there are sensory contents which are not related\nto judgments or any other mental functions such as space as he had\ndemonstrated in his Raumbuch. (see J. Bouveresse, 2006) Two\nimportant contributions from Stumpf in this book (Kaiserl-El-Safti,\n2011, pp. 38\u201339) rely on the famous concept of fusion\n(Verschmelzung) by which he characterizes the phenomenon of\nconsonance, which in turn constitutes the foundation of music, and the\ntheory of relations that Stumpf develops in the first volume of this\nwork. (Stumpf, 1883, \u00a7 6) This theory of fusion led to a debate\nwith Brentano (see C. Allesch 2003, R. Martinelli, 2013) and the\nimportance of this notion in Husserl\u2019s phenomenology is\nwell-known, particularly in relation to the latter\u2019s conception\nof figural moments. (C. Ierna, 2009)\n\nIn the field of psychology, Stumpf\u2019s name is also associated\nwith the famous case of Clever Hans, which aroused great interest in\nthe early twentieth century, and which represented a significant step\nin the development of experimental psychology. (H. Baranzke, 2001 W.\nPrinz, 2006 H. Gundlach, 2006) We know that Stumpf\u2019s assistant,\nO. Pfungst devoted an entire book to the case of Clever Hans in which\nhe presented the results of the investigation that he and Stumpf\nconducted. (Stumpf, 1907a, pp. 7\u201315) Similarly, Stumpf\ncontributed to the foundation of the anthropoid station in Tenerife\nwhere K\u00f6hler (1925) conducted his well-known research on\nchimpanzees. Stumpf was also interested in other similar phenomena,\nsuch as the study of child prodigies like Pepito Arriola and many\nothers. He founded in 1901 the Society for Child Psychology and\ncontributed two studies on that topic (Stumpf, 1900, 1901)\n",
