    "main_text": "Cognitive Science || Psycholinguistics\n5.3 Neurolinguistics\n\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, neuropsychological research on cognitive\ndeficits related to brain lesions has produced a considerable amount\nof findings related to the neural correlates of lexical semantic\ninformation and processing. More recently, the development of\nneuroimaging techniques such as PET, fMRI and ERP has provided further\nmeans to adjudicate hypotheses about lexical semantic processes in the\nbrain (Vigneau et al. 2006). Here we do not intend to provide a\ncomplete overview of such results (for a survey, see Faust 2012). We\nshall just mention three topics of neurolinguistic research that\nappear to bear on issues in the study of word meaning: the partition\nof the lexicon into categories, the representation of common nouns vs.\nproper names, and the distinction between the inferential and the\nreferential aspects of lexical competence.\n\nTwo preliminary considerations should be kept in mind. First, a\ndistinction must be drawn between the neural realization of word\nforms, i.e., traces of acoustic, articulatory, graphic, and motor\nconfigurations (\u2018peripheral lexicons\u2019), and the neural\ncorrelates of lexical meanings (\u2018concepts\u2019). A patient can\nunderstand what is the object represented by a picture shown to her\n(and give evidence of her understanding, e.g., by miming the\nobject\u2019s function) while being unable to retrieve the relevant\nphonological form from her output lexicon (Warrington 1985; Shallice\n1988). Second, there appears to be wide consensus about the\nirrelevance to brain processing of any distinction between strictly\nsemantic and factual or encyclopedic information (e.g., Tulving 1972;\nSartori et al. 1994). Whatever information is relevant to such\nprocesses as object recognition or confrontation naming is standardly\ncharacterized as \u2018semantic\u2019. This may be taken as a\nstipulation\u2014it is just how neuroscientists use the word\n\u2018semantic\u2019\u2014or as deriving from lack of evidence for\nany segregation between the domains of semantic and encyclopedic\ninformation (see Binder et al. 2009). Be that as it may, in\npresent-day neuroscience there seems to be no room for a correlate of\nthe analytic/synthetic distinction. Moreover, in the literature\n\u2018semantic\u2019 and \u2018conceptual\u2019 are often used\nsynonymously; hence, no distinction is drawn between lexical semantic\nand conceptual knowledge. Finally, the focus of neuroscientific\nresearch on \u201csemantics\u201d is on information structures\nroughly corresponding to word-level meanings, not to sentence-level\nmeanings: hence, so far neuroscientific research has had little to say\nabout the compositional mechanisms that have been the focus (and,\noften, the entire content) of theories of meaning as pursued within\nformal semantics and philosophy of language.\n\nLet us start with the partition of the semantic lexicon into\ncategories. Neuropsychological research indicates that the ability to\nname objects or to answer simple questions involving such nouns can be\nselectively lost or preserved: subjects can perform much better in\nnaming living entities than in naming artifacts, or in naming animate\nliving entities than in naming fruits and vegetables (Shallice 1988).\nDifferent patterns of brain activation may correspond to such\ndissociations between performances: e.g., Damasio et al. (1996) found\nthat retrieval of names of animals and of tools activate different\nregions in the left temporal lobe. However, the details of this\npartition have been interpreted in different ways. Warrington &\nMcCarthy (1983) and Warrington & Shallice (1984) explained the\nliving vs. artifactual dissociation by taking the category distinction\nto be an effect of the difference among features that are crucial in\nthe identification of living entities and artifacts: while living\nentities are identified mainly on the basis of perceptual features,\nartifacts are identified by their function. A later theory (Caramazza\n& Shelton 1998) claimed that animate and inanimate objects are\ntreated by different knowledge systems separated by evolutionary\npressure: domains of features pertaining to the recognition of living\nthings, human faces, and perhaps tools may have been singled out as\nrecognition of such entities had survival value for humans. Finally,\nDevlin et al. (1998) proposed to view the partition as the consequence\nof a difference in how recognition-relevant features are connected\nwith one another: in the case of artifactual kinds, an object is\nrecognized thanks to a characteristic coupling of form and function,\nwhereas no such coupling individuates kinds of living things (e.g.,\neyes go with seeing in many animal species). For non-neutral surveys,\nsee Caramazza & Mahon (2006) and Shallice & Cooper (2011).\n\nOn the other hand, it is also known that \u201csemantic\u201d (i.e.,\nconceptual) competence may be lost in its entirety (though often\ngradually). This is what typically happens in semantic dementia.\nEmpirical evidence has motivated theories of the neural realization of\nconceptual competence that are meant to account for both\nmodality-specific deficits and pathologies that involve impairment\nacross all modalities. The former may involve a difficulty or\nimpossibility to categorize a visually exhibited object which,\nhowever, can be correctly categorized in other modalities (e.g., if\nthe object is touched) or verbally described on the basis of the\nobject\u2019s name (i.e., on the basis of the lexical item supposedly\nassociated with the category). The original \u201chub and\nspokes\u201d model of the brain representation of concepts (Rogers et\nal. 2004, Patterson et al. 2007) accounted for both sets of findings\nby postulating that the semantic network is composed of a series of\n\u201cspokes\u201d, i.e., cortical areas distributed across the\nbrain processing modality-specific (visual, auditory, motor, as well\nas verbal) sources of information, and that the spokes are two-ways\nconnected to a transmodal \u201chub\u201d. While damage to the\nspokes accounts for modality-specific deficits, damage to the hub and\nits connections explains the overall impairment of semantic\ncompetence. On this model, the hub is supposed to be located in the\nanterior temporal lobe (ATL), since semantic dementia had been found\nto be associated with degeneration of the anterior ventral and polar\nregions of both temporal poles (Guo et al. 2013). According to more\nrecent, \u201cgraded\u201d versions of the model (Lambon Ralph et\nal. 2017), the contribution of the hub units may vary depending on\ndifferent patterns of connectivity to the spokes, to account for\nevidence of graded variation of function across subregions of ATL. It\nshould be noted that while many researchers converge on a distributed\nview of semantic representation and on the role of domain-specific\nparts of the neural network (depending on differential patterns of\nfunctional connectivity), not everybody agrees on the need to\npostulate a transmodal hub (see, e.g., Mahon & Caramazza\n2011).\n\nLet us now turn to common nouns and proper names. As we have seen, in\nthe philosophy of language of the last decades, proper names (of\npeople, landmarks, countries, etc.) have being regarded as\nsemantically different from common nouns. Neuroscientific research on\nthe processing of proper names and common nouns concurs, to some\nextent. To begin with, the retrieval of proper names is doubly\ndissociated from the retrieval of common nouns. Some patients proved\ncompetent with common nouns but unable to associate names to pictures\nof famous people, or buildings, or brands (Ellis, Young &\nCritchley 1989); in other cases, people\u2019s names were\nspecifically affected (McKenna & Warrington 1980). Other patients\nhad the complementary deficit. The patient described in Semenza &\nSgaramella (1993) could name no objects at all (with or without\nphonemic cues) but he was able to name 10 out of 10 familiar people,\nand 18 out of 22 famous people with a phonemic cue. Martins &\nFarrayota\u2018s (2007) patient ACB also presented impaired object\nnaming but spared retrieval of proper names. Such findings suggest\ndistinct neural pathways for the retrieval of proper names and common\nnouns (Semenza 2006). The study of lesions and neuroimaging research\nboth initially converged in identifying the left temporal pole as\nplaying a crucial role in the retrieval of proper names, from both\nvisual stimuli (Damasio et al. 1996) and the presentation of speaker\nvoices (Waldron et al. 2014) (though in at least one case damage to\nthe left temporal pole was associated with selective sparing of proper\nnames; see Martins & Farrajota 2007). In addition, recent research\nhas found a role for the uncinate fasciculus (UF). In patients\nundergoing surgical removal of UF, retrieval of common nouns was\nrecovered while retrieval of proper names remained impaired (Papagno\net al. 2016). The present consensus appears to be that \u201cthe\nproduction of proper names recruits a network that involves at least\nthe left anterior temporal lobe and the left orbitofrontal cortex\nconnected together by the UF\u201d (Br\u00e9dart 2017).\n\nFurthermore, a few neuropsychological studies have described patients\nwhose competence on geographical names was preserved while names of\npeople were lost: one patient had preserved country names, though he\nhad lost virtually every other linguistic ability (McKenna &\nWarrington 1978; see Semenza 2006 for other cases of selective\npreservation of geographical names). Other behavioral experiments seem\nto show that country names are closer to common nouns than to other\nproper names such as people and landmark names in that the\nconnectivity between the word and the conceptual system is likely to\nrequire diffuse multiple connections, as with common nouns (Hollis\n& Valentine 2001). If these results were confirmed, it would turn\nout that the linguistic category of proper names is not homogeneous in\nterms of neural processing. Studies have also demonstrated that the\nretrieval of proper names from memory is typically a more difficult\ncognitive task than the retrieval of common nouns. For example, it is\nharder to name faces (of famous people) than to name objects;\nmoreover, it is easier to remember a person\u2019s occupation than\nher or his name. Interestingly, the same difference does not\nmaterialize in definition naming, i.e., in tasks where names and\ncommon nouns are to be retrieved from definitions (Hanley 2011).\nThough several hypotheses about the source of this difference have\nbeen proposed (see Br\u00e9dart 2017 for a survey), no consensus has\nbeen reached on how to explain this phenomenon.\n\nFinally, a few words on the distinction between the inferential and\nthe referential component of lexical competence. As we have seen in\n Section 3.2,\n Marconi (1997) suggested that processing of lexical meaning might be\ndistributed between two subsystems, an inferential and a referential\none. Beginning with Warrington (1975), many patients had been\ndescribed that were more or less severely impaired in referential\ntasks such as naming from vision (and other perceptual modalities as\nwell), while their inferential competence was more or less intact. The\ncomplementary pattern (i.e., the preservation of referential abilities\nwith loss of inferential competence) is definitely less common. Still,\na number of cases have been reported, beginning with a stroke patient\nof Heilman et al. (1976), who, while unable to perform any task\nrequiring inferential processing, performed well in referential naming\ntasks with visually presented objects (he could name 23 of 25 common\nobjects). In subsequent years, further cases were described. For\nexample, in a study of 61 patients with lesions affecting linguistic\nabilities, Kemmerer et al. (2012) found 14 cases in which referential\nabilities were better preserved than inferential abilities. More\nrecently, Pandey & Heilman (2014), while describing one more case\nof preserved (referential) naming from vision with severely impaired\n(inferential) naming from definition, hypothesized that \u201cthese\ntwo naming tasks may, at least in part, be mediated by two independent\nneuronal networks\u201d. Thus, while double dissociation between\ninferential processes and naming from vision is well attested, it is\nnot equally clear that it involves referential processes in general.\nOn the other hand, evidence from neuroimaging is, so far, limited and\noverall inconclusive. Some neuroimaging studies (e.g.,\nTomaszewski-Farias et al. 2005, Marconi et al. 2013), as well as TMS\nmapping experiments (Hamberger et al. 2001, Hamberger & Seidel\n2009) did find different patterns of activation for inferential vs.\nreferential performances. However, the results are not entirely\nconsistent and are liable to different interpretations. For example,\nthe selective activation of the anterior left temporal lobe in\ninferential performances may well reflect additional syntactic demands\ninvolved in definition naming, rather than be due to inferential\nprocessing as such (see Calzavarini 2017 for a discussion).\n",
