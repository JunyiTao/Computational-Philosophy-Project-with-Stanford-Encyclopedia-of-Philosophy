    "main_text": "Theories of the Right to Secede || Comparing Theories of Secession\n2.6 Comparing Theories of Secession\n\n\nAt present it is fair to say that none of the rival types of\ntheories is sufficiently worked out for a definitive comparative\nevaluation to be possible. For each type of theory there are unanswered\nquestions and potential objections.\n\n\nAll three types of theories must address satisfactorily what may be\ncalled the problem of authentic voice. For ascriptivist and remedial\nright only theories, this means providing a reasoned answer to the\nquestion \u201cwhat counts as an authentic decision to attempt to\nsecede?\u201d (Is there some nonarbitrary way of specifying what sort\nof majority is required in favor of secession before it can be said\nthat the group in question has chosen to exercise its right to\nsecede?). Similarly, plebiscitary right theorists must provide a\nprincipled account of how large a majority in favor of secession must\nexist, before it can be said that the right to secede exists.\n\n\nIn addition, all three types of theories must articulate a plausible\naccount of the rights of those within the seceding territory who oppose\nsecession. For example, are there circumstances in which the\nanti-secessionists should be granted dual citizenship, so that they can\npreserve their citizenship in the state from which the secession is\noccurring? Are there circumstances in which they deserve compensation\nfor losses they incur when a new state, perhaps with different property\nlaws, is created?\n\n\nFinally, as suggested earlier, the implications of each type of\ntheory for international law regarding secession should be explained.\nIn the next section, we explore briefly the relationship between views\nabout the moral (claim-)right to unilateral secession and the question\nof what position international law should take on unilateral\nsecession.\n",
