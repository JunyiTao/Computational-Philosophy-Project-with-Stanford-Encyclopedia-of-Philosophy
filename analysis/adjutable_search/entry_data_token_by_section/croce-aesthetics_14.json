To say that the work of art is identical\nwith the intuition is to say that it is necessarily private. It is to\nsay, for example, that since one man\u2019s intuition of\nBotticelli\u2019s Venus is necessarily different from any\none else\u2019s, there is no such thing as Botticelli\u2019s\nVenus, understood not as a material painting but as a work of\nart; there is only Botticelli\u2019s-Venus-for-A,\nBotticelli\u2019s-Venus-for-B, and so on. But these\nintuitions cannot be compared, and there is no higher standard; thus\nthey cannot be said to agree or disagree, since any such comparison\nwould be logically impossible (see Tilghman 1971, Ch. 1, for further\ndiscussion; for at attempt at saving Croce, see Schusterman 1983). The\nposition is perhaps not contradictory, but it is exceedingly\nunattractive; it renders art a diversion away from reality, when as\nFreud emphasized\u2014to invoke a figure who is Croce\u2019s\nopposite in almost every respect\u2014the artist\u2019s struggle\nwith the medium is the attempt to conquer reality. Although Croce\ndisowned this consequence, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that on\nthis view art is a domain of fancy (in the bad sense), without any\ncheck upon vanity (see Aes. 122 for a point at which Croce\nalmost sees the point). If we bring back the material painted object\ninto the picture, of course, then there is no such difficulty: ones\n\u2018intuition\u2019 will be accurate, or one\u2019s\ninterpretation will be correct, just in case it corresponds to the\npicture (of course the notion of \u2018corresponds to the\npicture\u2019 is only a placeholder for a great deal to be supplied\nby theories of representation, perspective, expression and other parts\nof aesthetics; but the one thing that plausible theories will share is\na commitment to the object, the material painting).\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing again that Croce\u2019s claim that\nintuition is expression, and consequently that works art are mental\nobjects, is not just an application of his general idealism. It is\nindependent of it. In the Encyclopaedia Britannica article,\nfor example, he allows himself to speak for convenience of the\n\u2018spiritual\u2019 and \u2018physical\u2019, in order to make\nthe point that the physical object is only of practical, and not of\naesthetic significance (PPH 227\u20138).\n",
