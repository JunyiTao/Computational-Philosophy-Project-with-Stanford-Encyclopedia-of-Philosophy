    "main_text": "Life and Writings || Eriugena as Liberal Arts Master\n1.1 Eriugena as Liberal Arts Master\n\nNothing is known about Eriugena\u2019s place or date of birth or of\nthe circumstances of his early life, but, on the basis of\ncircumstantial evidence and some surviving testimonia\n(helpfully gathered in Brennan 1986), it is conjectured that he was\nborn in Ireland around 800 or possibly slightly earlier (c. 790). His\nIrish provenance is confirmed by the fact that he self-consciously\nsigned his translation of Pseudo-Dionysius\u2019 works with the\nneologism \u201cEriugena\u201d (Patrologia Latina,\nhereafter PL, 122: 1236a) meaning \u201cIrish born\u201d, a word\npossibly modelled on the Virgilian \u201cGraiugena\u201d\n(Aeneid 3.550, see Heyworth & Morwood, 2017: 223).\nThe word \u201cEriugena\u201d\nbecame corrupted to \u201cErigena\u201d in twelfth century library\nentries (e.g., the Cluny catalogue) and by the seventeenth century it\nbecame common to refer to him as \u201cJohn Scot(t)us Erigena\u201d\n(e.g., by Bishop Ussher and Thomas Gale). A scattering of Old Irish\nwords used to explain difficult or recondite Latin terms, in his\nBiblical glosses (Glossae; see edition by Contreni &\n\u00d3 N\u00e9ill, 1997), is further evidence of his Irish origin\nand of the presence of Irish students in his audience (since the time\nof Charlemagne Irish scholars had constituted a considerable presence\nin the Frankish court, where they were renowned for their\nlearning).\n\nEriugena\u2019s first certain appearance in historical records occurs\naround 850/1 where mention is made, in a letter by Bishop Pardulus of\nLaon, of \u201ca certain Irishman, named Johannes, who is at the\npalace of the king\u201d (\u201cScotum illum qui est in palatio\nregis, joannem nomine\u201d, Epistola ad ecclesiam\nLugdunensem, in De tribus epistolis, PL 121: 1052a), who\nwas engaged in a theological controversy with Gottschalk of Fulda. It\nis also certain that Johannes had been installed for some time at the\ncourt of Charles the Bald, the West Frankish king, but he was also\nassociated with other ecclesiastical centers, including Rheims, Laon,\nSoissons, and Compigne. There is no direct evidence that he was a monk\nor cleric (he refers to his \u201cfrater in Christo\u201d\n[\u201cbrother in Christ\u201d], Periphyseon, PL 122:\n1022a, Wulfad, who later became a bishop, but this appellation does\nnot definitively confirm Eriugena\u2019s own church status).\n\nEriugena had a justified reputation among his contemporaries as a man\nof considerable learning. Florus calls him scholasticus et\neruditus (PL 119: 103a) and Anastasius the Librarian (c. 810\u2013c.878), the Vatican librarian of\nthe day, marveled at the fact that this \u201cbarbarian\u201d\n(vir barbarus) from a remote land knew Greek. (Brennan, 1986)\nTwo partial commentaries (c.\n840\u2013c.850) on De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii\n(The Marriage of Philolology and Mercury), the liberal arts\nhandbook of the late Latin author, Martianus Capella, survive from\nEriugena\u2019s period as royal master, as well as the Biblical\nglosses, Glossae Divinae Historiae, all of which attest to\nhis skill as a grammaticus. Eriugena has a rich and eclectic\nknowledge of the liberal arts tradition, including Isidore,\nCassiodorus, and Cicero. He had a reputation for dialectic, as his\nopponents recognized when they criticized him for bringing his\ndialectical skills to bear on theological discussion. Thus, his critic\nPrudentius remarked: \u201cYour Capella has led you into a labyrinth,\nbecause you have tied yourself more to the meditation of his work than\nto the truth of the Gospel\u201d (PL 115: 1294a). Nevertheless, Eriugena continues the approach of Alcuin to make the arts more\nthan mere instruments but to connect them to wisdom and to point to\nthe unity of knowledge; thus he is both a contributor and a catalyst for the \u201cnew wave\u201d\nunleashed by the adoption of Priscian and Martianus Capella (see\nContreni, 1992) \n\n\nThe Martianus commentary is most famous for its apparent espousal of a\nnon-Ptolemaic account of the movement of the planets in Book Seven on\nastronomy. Pierre Duhem (1958) thought that Eriugena was offering a\nversion of the system later proposed by Tycho Brahe, and in fact\nEriugena is correctly reporting Martianus\u2019 account which seems\nto be a version of Heraclides of Pontus\u2019 theory. Indeed,\nCopernicus would later single out Martianus for praise for his theory\nthat Mercury and Venus orbit the sun instead of the earth. Eriugena\nwent further than Martianus in placing Mars and Jupiter in orbit\naround the sun also.\n\nThe influence of Eriugena is difficult to gauge but the echoes are\nunmistakable among his immediate posterity among the Carolingians such\nas Heiric of Auxerre (841\u2013c.880), Almann of Hautvillers (active\nc.865\u2013c.875), and perhaps Hucbald of Saint-Amand (c.\n840/850\u2013930) (see Contreni, 1992).\n",
