    "main_text": "Evolution and Distribution of Consciousness || Humans\n6.1 Humans\n As described above, the view that consciousness is unique to\nhumans has a long history. It coheres with a religious view of\nhumanity as the pinnacle of creation, and it also may be appealing\ninsofar as it absolves us of any guilt for our treatment of\nanimals. Religion aside, it may derive considerable intuitive support\nbecause of the appeal of connecting consciousness to the problem of\nhuman uniquenesss.  If consciousness can be tied together with\nlanguage, abstract reasoning, or some other mental characteristic that\npotentially could explain our apparent seperateness from the natural\nworld, this would solve two outstanding mysteries at once. \n\nDennett (1991, 1995) has been an outspoken advocate of the\nhuman-uniqueness of consciousness. Dennett argues for this position in\nconnection with his anti-realist theory of consciousness, the upshot\nof which is that consciousness is a sort of \u201cuser\nillusion\u201d (1995) or \u201cfiction\u201d (1991, p. 365, p. 429)\nconstructed through people\u2019s narrative descriptions:\n\nWhat there is, really, is just various events of\ncontent-fixation occuring in various places at various times in the\nbrain... Some of these content-fixations have further effects, which\neventually lead to the utterance of sentences \u2014 in a natural\nlanguage \u2014 either public or merely internal. And so a\nheterophenomenological text is created... What about the actual\nphenomenology? There is no such thing. (1991 p 365)\n\nOn Dennett\u2019s view, because consciousness is a sort of story telling,\nwhich requires language, and only (adult, normally enculturated and\nlanguage-capable) humans have language, only these humans have\nconsciousness.\n\n\nCarruthers has championed the view that only humans (with the possible\nexception of chimpanzees) are conscious, although for different\nreasons than Dennett. Carruthers (1998a,b, 2000) has argued to this\neffect based on his \u2018higher-order thought\u2019 theory,\naccording to which, phenomenal consciousness requires the capacity to\nthink about, and therefore conceptualize, one\u2019s own \n thoughts.[8] \n Such conceptualization requires, according to Carruthers, a theory of mind.\nAnd, Carruthers maintains, there is little basis for thinking that any\nnonhuman animals have a theory of mind, with the possible exception of\nchimpanzees (see Lurz 2011 and Andrews 2012 for in depth discussion of\ntheory of mind in nonhuman animals). This argument is, of course, no\nstronger than the higher-order thought account of consciousness upon\nwhich it is based.  But setting that aside for the sake of argument,\nthis challenge by Carruthers deserves further attention as perhaps the\nmost empirically-detailed case against animal consciousness to have\nbeen made in the philosophical literature.\n\n\nCarruthers neither endorses nor outright rejects the conclusion that\nchimpanzees are sentient. His suspicion that even chimpanzees might\nlack theory of mind, and therefore (on his view) phenomenal\nconsciousness, is based on some ingenious laboratory studies by\nPovinelli (1996) showing that in interactions with human food\nproviders, chimpanzees apparently fail to understand the role of eyes\nin providing visual information to the humans, despite their outwardly\nsimilar behavior to humans in attending to cues such as facial\norientation. The interpretation of Povinelli\u2019s work remains\ncontroversial. Hare et al. (2000) conducted experiments in\nwhich dominant and subordinate animals competed with each other for\nfood, and concluded that \u201cat least in some situations\nchimpanzees know what conspecifics do and do not see and, furthermore,\nthat they use this knowledge to formulate their behavioral strategies\nin food competition situations.\u201d They suggest that Povinelli\u2019s\nnegative results may be due to the fact that his experiments involve\nless natural chimp-human interactions. Given the uncertainty,\nCarruthers is therefore well-advised in the tentative manner in which\nhe puts forward his claims about chimpanzee sentience.\n\n\nA full discussion of the controversy over theory of mind (e.g., Heyes\n1998; Lurz 2011; Andrews 2012) deserves an entry of its own, but it is\nworth remarking here that the theory of mind debate has origins in the\nhypothesis that primate intelligence in general, and human\nintelligence in particular, is specially adapted for social cognition\n(see Byrne & Whiten 1988, especially the first two chapters, by\nJolly and Humphrey).  Consequently, it has been argued that evidence\nfor the ability to attribute mental states in a wide range of species\nmight be better sought in natural activities such as social play,\nrather than in laboratory designed experiments which place the animals\nin artificial situations (Allen & Bekoff 1997; see esp. chapter 6;\nsee also Hare et al. 2000, Hare et al. 2001, and\nHare & Wrangham 2002).  Alternative approaches that have attempted\nto provide strong evidence of theory of mind in nonhuman animals under\nnatural conditions have generally failed to produce such evidence\n(see, e.g., the conclusions about theory of mind in vervet monkeys and\nbaboons by Cheney & Seyfarth 1990, 2007), although anecdotal\nevidence tantalizingly suggests that researchers still have not\nmanaged to devise the right experiments. Furthermore, theory of mind\n\u2014 and social cognition more broadly \u2014 are active areas of\nresearch, and it is quite possible that new research will reveal\nevidence of theory of mind in nonhuman animals.  \n\n\nOn views such as Carruthers\u2019, consciousness is grounded in cognitive\nprocesses that are highly specific and modular \u2014 indeed,\nirrelevant for the perceptual, motivational and cognitive processes\ninvolved with all nonhuman animal behavior. Given that most of the\ncognitive processes (and corresponding brain-systems) involved with\nhuman activities are shared with nonhuman animals, this line of\nthinking implies that much of human activity is nonconscious as\nwell. Thus, for example, Carruthers (1989, 1992) argued that\nall animal behavior can be assimilated to the non-conscious\nactivities of humans, such as driving while distracted (\u201con\nautopilot\u201d), or to the capacities of \u201cblindsight\u201d\npatients whose damage to visual cortex leaves them phenomenologically\nblind in a portion of their visual fields (a \u201cscotoma\u201d)\nbut nonetheless able to identify things presented to the scotoma. (He\nrefers to both of these as examples of \u201cunconscious\nexperiences\u201d.)\n This comparison of animal behavior to the unconscious capacities\nof humans can be criticized on the grounds that, like Descartes\u2019\npronouncements on parrots, it is based only on unsystematic\nobservation of animal behavior. There are grounds for thinking that\ncareful investigation would reveal that there is not a very close\nanalogy between animal behavior and human behaviors associated with\nthese putative cases of unconscious experience. For instance, it is\nnotable that the unconscious experiences of automatic driving are not\nremembered by their subjects, whereas there is no evidence that\nanimals are similarly unable to recall their allegedly unconscious\nexperiences.  Likewise, blindsight subjects do not spontaneously\nrespond to things presented to their scotomas, but must be trained to\nmake responses using a forced-response paradigm. There is no evidence\nthat such limitations are normal for animals, or that animals behave\nlike blindsight victims with respect to their visual experiences\n(Jamieson & Bekoff 1992).\n\n\nNevertheless, there are empirical grounds for concern that behavior\nsuggesting consciousness in animals may be the product of unconscious\nprocesses.  Allen et al. (2009) describe work on learning in\nspinal cords of rats that shows phenomena analogous to latent\ninhibition and overshadowing.  In intact animals, these learning and\nmemory related phenomena have been argued to involve attention.  But\ntheir similarity to mechanisms in the spinal cord, assumed by most not\nto involve consciousness, calls into question their status as evidence\nfor consciousness. There are, of course, differences between the\nlearning capacities of spinal cords and the learning capacities of\nintact organisms, and there are prima facie reasons for thinking that\nsophisticated forms of learning are related to consciousness (Clark\n& Squire 1998; Allen 2004; Ginsburg & Jablonka 2007b). But \nthe current point is similar to that made\nabout blindsight: a more fine-grained analysis of these similarities\nand differences is needed before conclusions about consciousness can\nbe drawn.\n",
