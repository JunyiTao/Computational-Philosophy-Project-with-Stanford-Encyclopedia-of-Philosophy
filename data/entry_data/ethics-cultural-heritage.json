    "preamble": "\n\nDo members of cultural groups have special claims to own or control\nthe products of the cultures to which they belong? Is there something\nmorally wrong with employing artistic styles that are distinctive of a\nculture to which you do not belong? What is the relationship between\ncultural heritage and group identity? Is there a coherent and morally\nacceptable sense of cultural group membership in the first place? Is\nthere a universal human heritage to which everyone has a claim?\nQuestions such as these concern the ethics of cultural heritage (or\nheritage ethics, for short). This entry seeks to provide an overview\nof the philosophical work on topics in heritage ethics, as well as\nintroduce readers to some of the most philosophically relevant\nliterature from other disciplines.\n\nRunning through the specific topics discussed below is a set of common\nthemes. One theme concerns a tension between universalism and cultural\nspecificity. On the one hand, there is a pull towards conceiving of\ncultural heritage as universally valuable, grounding consequent rights\nor permissions for all concerning its use and ownership. On the other\nhand, there is a push for culturally specific rights and restrictions\nthat recognize the special claims of particular cultural groups. A\nrelated theme concerns the distribution of power among cultural groups\nand the role that colonial dynamics have played in establishing\ncurrent patterns of access to, and control over, cultural heritage. A\nthird theme concerns how we understand the composition and boundaries\nof cultural groups, and whether any such account can avoid charges of\nessentialism (the idea that there is a necessary \u201cessence\u201d\nto cultural group membership). As we will see, specific controversies\nover cultural property, repatriation, cultural appropriation, and\nheritage preservation, are each shaped by these recurrent themes.\n\nOn the one hand, cultural heritage is about the past, as suggested by\nthe ubiquitous framing of heritage ethics topics in terms of the\nquestion \u201cWho owns the past?\u201d But on the other hand,\ncultural heritage is just as much about the present and the future:\nabout how culture is embroiled in contemporary moral controversies,\nand about what our cultural legacy will be.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. What is Cultural Heritage?\n\nCultural heritage is a broad and nebulous concept, and discussions\noften assume an understanding meant to capture its heterogeneity. For\ninstance, a representative definition reads as follows:\n\n\nHeritage encompasses a broad and overarching term: \u201cit\u201d is\nsomething that someone or a collective considers to be worthy of being\nvalued, preserved, catalogued, exhibited, restored, admired. (Kersel\n& Luke 2015: 71)\n\n\nHowever, although a commonplace understanding of cultural heritage is\nassumed in many discussions, attention to these conceptual assumptions\ncan also yield criticisms with moral and political implications. The\nfollowing subsections cover some of the conceptual questions that are\nraised about what precisely cultural heritage is.\n1.1 What is Culture?\n\nDiscussions in the literature generally assume a broad understanding\nof culture that is often not explicitly defined (e.g., Thompson 2003;\nYoung 2007), but those definitions that do appear typically take the\nform of open-ended lists: culture is the product of human activity,\nparticularly those things that are socially transmitted, including\nbeliefs, practices, objects, etc. (Appiah 1994: 111\u2013112;\nScheffler 2007: 107). Culture is thus generally taken to be a\ndescriptive term that does not carry with it the evaluative and often\nelitist connotations of culture as implying a certain kind of\n\u201ccivilization\u201d (Appiah 1994: 111\u2013114). This\n\u201canthropological\u201d definition of culture is sometimes\ncriticized as overly broad, failing to discriminate between those\npractices (e.g.) that are worthwhile and those that are not (Logan\n2007: 37), but it remains the general touchstone in the literature.\nIndeed, culture is often treated as a \u201cgood\u201d thing in the\ncontext of the cultural heritage literature, despite the fact that\nsome cultural practices are subject to serious moral objections (Okin\n1997; Brown 2005: 50\u201351). In any event, though this anodyne\ndefinition of culture in general may be readily accepted, defining any\nparticular culture tends to be difficult and contentious (Scheffler\n2007; Appiah 2006; Narayan 1998). Proponents of cultural preservation\nor integrity are often accused of making misguided assumptions about\ncultures as static, bounded wholes that are empirically and\nnormatively flawed (e.g., Benhabib 2002; Mezey 2007). Indeed, these\ncriticisms surface in many arguments concerning heritage ethics, as\nwill be discussed in subsequent sections (see in particular\n 4.2.3).\n1.2 What is Heritage?\n\nAt its core, the concept of \u2018heritage\u2019 is typically taken\nto mean the inheritance of something from the past (in the case of\ncultural heritage, culture; Harrison 2009: 9; Prott &\nO\u2019Keefe 1992: 311). Increasing attention to the range of ways\nthat heritage is employed and interpreted in contemporary contexts has\nled to an emphasis on the use of the past for present purposes as an\nintegral aspect of the definition of heritage itself (Harrison 2013:\n14; Smith 2006: 44; Ashworth, Graham, & Tunbridge 2007: 3).\nRecognition of this facet of heritage has opened up avenues for\ncritique and reinterpretation of the concept of heritage (Lowenthal\n1998). By making manifest how heritage is used for present purposes,\nwe can identify tacit evaluative assumptions that may have gone\nunremarked upon in the past. In particular, scholars have come to\ndistinguish between \u201cofficial\u201d and\n\u201cunofficial\u201d heritage (Harrison 2013: 14\u201315).\n\nThe idea of \u201cofficial heritage\u201d has been shaped in\nparticular by Laurajane Smith\u2019s analysis of what she calls the\nAuthorized Heritage Discourse (Smith 2006). This is the presentation\nof heritage familiar to us from museums, national monuments, and other\ninstitutionally endorsed understandings of heritage, such as the\nUNESCO World Heritage List. \u201cOfficial heritage\u201d is thus\noften used by governments and cultural institutions to cultivate a\nsense of national or cosmopolitan identity around some aspect of the\npast. As Smith summarizes:\n\n\nThis dominant Western discourse stresses materiality, monumentality,\ngrandiosity, time depth, aesthetics and all that is \u2018good\u2019\nin history and culture. (Smith 2010: 63)\n\n\nOfficial heritage on the global scale of UNESCO is typically presented\nas having a universal value that transcends local attachments (Cleere\n1996; Omland 2006; Matthes 2015). According to Smith\u2019s critique,\nthe material focus of official heritage impedes recognition of the\nfact that heritage is best understood as a process of interpretation\nthat is ongoing, in contrast with the pre-digested lists and museum\ndisplays presented by the official line.\n\n\nHeritage\u2026 is a cultural process that engages with acts of\nremembering that work to create ways to understand and engage with the\npresent, and the sites themselves are cultural tools that can\nfacilitate, but are not necessarily vital for, this process. (Smith\n2006: 44)\n\n\nThus, in contrast with the \u201ctop-down\u201d nature of\n\u201cofficial heritage\u201d, \u201cunofficial heritage\u201d is\ncharacterized by the \u201cbottom-up\u201d ways in which individuals\nsort out their relationship to, and uses of, the past, which may be in\ntension with, or at least unrecognized by, official characterizations\nof heritage (Harrison 2009: 8).\n\n\nExamples include local festivals that are not recognised as of\ninterest to the state, or the heritage of migrant groups or the\nworking class. (Harrison 2013: 16)\n\n\nThis critique also draws our attention to \u201cintangible\u201d\nforms of heritage, in contrast with the material focus of the\ntraditional line, discussed further in\n section 2.5.\n\nThough the distinction between official and unofficial heritage is\nuseful both for drawing attention to how heritage is subject to\nconstant reinterpretation and for challenging dominant historical\nnarratives, some might be hesitant about the extent to which certain\nunderstandings of heritage that emphasize process do so at the expense\nof the traditional material concerns of official heritage. For\ninstance, one might think there is something significant\n(aesthetically, ethically, etc.) about the kinds of old material\nvalues that official heritage tends to endorse (e.g., Korsmeyer 2016;\nJames 2013; Saito 2007), even if these values should also be\nchallenged and supplemented from other cultural perspectives.\n\nAs noted above, heritage (and official heritage in particular) tends\nto be associated with positive evaluations of the past (Harrison 2013;\nWeiss 2007), though not universally so (Smith 2017). Indeed,\n\u201cthe word for \u2018heritage\u2019 in many language has an\noverwhelmingly positive public connotation\u201d (Macdonald 2009: 9).\nThis makes the identification of sites of injustice and atrocity as\nheritage a particularly fraught affair (often referred to as negative,\ndifficult, or dissonant heritage) raising questions about how to\nreconcile the positive associations of the heritage concept with sites\nthat people experience as traumatic (Meskell 2002; Macdonald 2009,\n2016; Tunbridge & Ashworth 1996; Sandis 2014a). These tensions can\nbring to the fore competing conceptions of national identity or\nhistorical narrative, especially in the context of regime change or\ncivil war.\n1.3 Cultural Heritage vs. National Heritage\n\nIt is important to note a distinction between cultural heritage and\nnational heritage. As the discussions of official heritage and\ndifficult heritage reveal, heritage can play an influential role in\ncultivating a sense of national identity around a national culture\n(Ireland & Schofield 2015: 2; Weiss 2007). However, it is\nimportant not to conflate the idea of a national culture with the\nempirically false claim that nations are culturally homogeneous:\nindeed, the intranational diversity of cultures is the fact from which\nthe political problem of multiculturalism arises (see entry on\n multiculturalism).\n There is of course significant cultural diversity in cultural\ngroupings of many kinds, nationalistic or not. This topic is discussed\nfurther in\n section 2.2.\n1.4 Heritage vs. History\n\nConsonant with the idea that heritage is inherently concerned with the\nuse of the past for present purposes, some commentators are at pains\nto point out the difference between a more political understanding of\nheritage in contrast with a more scholarly understanding of history\n(e.g., Lowenthal 1985). They emphasize in particular heritage\u2019s\nlax relationship with the truth:\n\n\nHistory seeks to convince by truth and succumbs to falsehood. Heritage\nexaggerates and omits, candidly inverts and frankly forgets, and\nthrives on ignorance and terror. (Lowenthal 1998: 121)\n\n\nHowever, one might worry that this statement contrasts an ideal of\nhistorical scholarship with a caricature of heritage at its worst.\nHistorians, too, are subject to concerns about how their narratives\nportray and map onto the record of past events (Trouillot 1995; entry\non\n philosophy of history).\n We might think that heritage, too, should be constrained by the\ntruth, even when it operates in the service of nationalism (Abizadeh\n2004).\n1.5 Cultural Heritage vs. Natural Heritage\n\nCulture has historically been distinguished from nature, but that\ndichotomy has come under attack in many disciplines: the study of\nheritage is no exception (Harrison 2015). A sharp distinction between\nthe two seems particularly ill-placed in cultural contexts where\nnature figures prominently, as is the case in many indigenous and\naboriginal cultural contexts. For instance, if relationships with the\nland (Figueroa & Waitt 2010) or particular plant and animal\nspecies (Whyte 2017) are of particular cultural significance, then a\ndichotomy between natural and cultural heritage can fail to accurately\nrepresent the beliefs and practices of these cultures. Moreover, some\nendeavor to illuminate theoretical approaches to the value of cultural\nheritage via conceptual tools from work on the value of nature,\narguing that we should treat heritage conservation like nature\nconservation, importing common thinking about the intrinsic value of\nnature into our thinking about cultural heritage (Harding 1999).\nHowever, dissolution of the contrast between natural and cultural\nheritage is also subject to objections. For instance, discourse\nsurrounding nature can bring with it methods and understandings that\nreintroduce problems into discussion of cultural heritage, such as the\nelevation of cultural heritage to a \u201cuniversal\u201d value\n(discussed further in\n section 2.2)\n that can disenfranchise or displace local cultural communities\n(O\u2019Neill 2002), or as a non-renewable resource on par with\ncommon thinking about the value of nature, leading to state\nintervention (Meskell 2011). As a consequence of the collapse between\nthese two domains, some argue\n\n\nthat the legacies of enclosure, eviction and salvage that developed\naround sites of natural value have indelibly informed our\nunderstanding and management of cultural places. (Meskell 2011:\n23)\n\n2. Cultural Property\n2.1 What is Cultural Property?\n\nAt a basic level, the concept of \u201ccultural property\u201d\ncaptures the idea that something (an artifact, artwork, style, place,\netc.) can be the property of a cultural group (Appiah 2006: 118;\nThompson 2003: 252), and thus entail some set of collective rights\nconcerning ownership, access, and use, even if title to the property\nis held by a particular individual. The concept thus raises a number\nof difficult philosophical questions concerning cultural groups, the\nnature of property, and the relation between them.\n2.2 The Scope of Cultural Property Value\n\nOne fundamental question about cultural property concerns who has a\nreasonable interest in it. Only members of a particular culture?\nMembers of a nation that many cultural members call home? All of\nhumanity? Insofar as legal institutions of property are meant to\nprotect our moral property interests, an answer to this question has\nthe potential to in turn shape legal norms governing cultural property\n(see entry on\n property and ownership).\n An influential approach in the cultural property literature is to\ndistinguish between cultural nationalist and cultural internationalist\npositions concerning how broadly a reasonable interest in cultural\nproperty should be construed (Merryman 1986).\n\nAccording to cultural internationalists, each particular culture\ncontributes to an overarching human culture, and thus everyone has an\ninterest in cultural property (Merryman 1986; this view is often\nlabeled \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d as well (Appiah 2006)). Proponents\nof cultural internationalism typically uses claims about the universal\nvalue of cultural heritage to argue against nationalist restrictions\non its export and sale, as well as against many repatriation claims\n(discussed further in\n section 3;\n Merryman 1986, 1994; Appiah 2006). This position finds support in\nvarious aspects of international law and policy, including the Hague\nConvention of 1954 (Merryman 1986) and the criterion of\n\u201coutstanding universal value\u201d in the 1972 UNESCO World\nHeritage Convention (Cleere 1996; Omland 2006). These claims about the\nuniversal evaluative scope of cultural property are often predicated\non a metaphysical claim about the constitutive relationship between\nparticular cultures and Human Culture: that it is precisely because\neach culture is a component of Human Culture that each individual\nculture therefore has a universal value in which everyone has a\nreasonable interest. However, even independently of the strength of\nthis claim, one might think that individual cultures can secure a\nuniversal value in other ways. For instance, according to one line of\nargument, there are a diversity of grounds for valuing a particular\nculture (such as ancestry, citizenship, geography, study, etc.) such\nthat most everyone could have a reasonable interest in a particular\nculture (Matthes 2015).\n\nAccording to the cultural nationalist position, on the other hand,\nnations have a \u201cspecial interest\u201d in their cultural\nproperty that \u201cimplies the attribution of national character to\nobjects\u201d (Merryman 1986: 832). This position also has support in\ninternational law and policy, in particular, the 1970 UNESCO\nConvention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit\nImport, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property\n(Merryman 1986). Proponents of cultural nationalism typically use\nclaims about the special national character of cultural heritage to\nargue in favor of nationalist retention policies that restrict or\nlimit the export or sale of cultural heritage (discussed further in\n section 3.1.1;\n Moustakas 1989). It is worth noting that the dichotomy between\ncultural nationalists and internationalists faces a significant\nlimitation in that it does not leave an obvious place for the claims\nof intra-national cultural groups such as Native American tribes\n(Watkins 2005). Although cultural nationalism might in principle\naccount for the claims of sovereign indigenous nations, it has in\npractice focused on the interests of independent nation-states.\nMoreover, although indigenous cultural property claims have received\nincreasing attention in both policy and scholarship (discussed further\nin sections\n 2.3\n and\n 3),\n appeals to nationalist and internationalist claims remain common in\npractice, and indeed, the interests and claims of intra-national\ngroups can be in tension with the nationalist identity-building that\nnation-states often promote through cultural heritage (Watkins\n2005).\n\nOne way to read the dispute between cultural nationalists and\ninternationalists is as a dispute over which kind of value-claim\nshould be prioritized: a proponent of each position could recognize\nthe value claims made by both camps, but think that their own should\ntrump the other (Thompson 2003: 258). Alternatively, one might think\nthat claims about universal human value call into question the\napplicability of some of the traditional bundle of property rights.\nFor instance, one might argue that the universal value of cultural\nheritage entails that it should not be excludable in the manner that\nproperty typically is (Thompson 2004: 545\u2013546). Or, in a similar\nvein, one might argue that we should prioritize the preservation of\nsuch objects to the exclusion of any claims to holding them as\nproperty (Warren 1989: 22). This is a move toward a\n\u201cstewardship\u201d as opposed to \u201cownership\u201d model\nfor thinking about cultural property, which is subject to its own set\nof objections, and will be discussed below in\n section 2.4.\n2.3 The Problem of Cultural Continuity\n\nIf cultural property belongs to a cultural group, then this seems to\nrequire some grasp on who constitute the members of the group (Young\n2007: 112). However, defining cultural group membership is a\nnotoriously difficult task (Killmister 2011). For one, it confronts\nproblems concerning cultural essentialism (discussed in\n section 4.2.3\n below). But moreover (and relatedly), it presents questions\nconcerning cultural continuity over time (Appiah 2006: 119). On what\nbasis, for instance, can the contemporary nation of Egypt claim the\nart and cultural artifacts of ancient Egypt as their cultural\nproperty, given the profound cultural differences between contemporary\nand ancient Egyptians? The same question can be raised for many of the\ncultural property claims made by contemporary nations. However,\nalthough there may not be strict cultural identity (in the sense of\nsameness) between cultural groups over time, due in part to the\ndynamic nature of culture, one might question why this kind of strict\nidentity should be thought so important. For instance, we might\ninstead appeal to cultural lineages, analogous to the links of\npsychological connectedness that some think can secure a relevant\nunderstanding of personal identity over time (Parfit 1984; entry on\n personal identity).\n For instance, an overlapping chain of practices, traditions, norms,\nand beliefs could be used to justify the claim that a culture at\nt1 is \u201cthe same culture\u201d as the culture at\nt0, even if it has undergone significant changes. Indeed, one\nmight think that a degree of change is in fact essential for the\npreservation of cultural identity over time (Coleman 2006: 167).\nGranted, this may lead to a plurality of cultural descendants that\nwould make cultural property claims difficult to adjudicate in\npractice, but it is worth noting that the assumption in favor of a\nstrong understanding of cultural identity over time as a necessary\ncondition for cultural property remains largely undefended in the\nliterature.\n\nThat being said, there are additional moral objections to nations in\nparticular making cultural property claims. Nations need not be\nculturally homogeneous, and thus nationalist cultural property claims\nmight objectionably run roughshod over strong intra-national cultural\nproperty claims, for instance, those made by colonized indigenous\ncultural groups (Thompson 2003: 252; Watkins 2005). From the opposite\ndirection, one might worry about how nationalist cultural property\nclaims would restrict the exchange of cultural property around the\nworld, an objectionable consequence if one embraces the influential\nidea (mentioned in\n 2.2\n above) that cultural property has value for all of humanity (Merryman\n1986, 1994).\n\nMoreover, there is a worry that the competing natures of\n\u201cculture\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d generate a\nparadoxical relationship when they are combined in the purported\nconcept of cultural property.\n\n\nProperty is fixed, possessed, controlled by its owner, and alienable.\nCulture is none of these things. Thus cultural property claims tend to\nfix culture, which if anything is unfixed, dynamic, and unstable.\n(Mezey 2007: 2005)\n\n\nSo, not only does the dynamic nature of culture raise metaphysical and\nepistemological questions about the grounds for cultural property\nclaims, it is moreover inherently at odds with the bonds and\nboundaries with which the concept of property attempts to saddle it.\nThus, cultural property tends to offer a version of fixed cultures\nattached to bounded groups that is more amenable to the concept of\nproperty, but consequently offers a distorted and \u201canemic\u201d\npicture of culture (Mezey 2007: 2005\u20136).\n\nOne way to resolve the paradox is to challenge the interpretations of\nthe core concepts that appear to set them at odds. For instance, one\nmight argue that the paradox is generated by reading property in a\nstrict \u201cownership\u201d sense that prioritizes rights of\nexcludability (the right to prevent others from use and access) and\nalienability (the right to transfer property); see entry on\n property and ownership).\n In contrast, an analysis of property in terms of\n\u201cstewardship\u201d, which recognizes a broader range of rights\nand responsibilities for non-title holders, may relax the perceived\nemphasis on property as fixed and bounded, allowing for an\nunderstanding of property that could plausibly avoid the same tensions\nwith the dynamic nature of culture (Carpenter, Katyal, & Riley\n2009: 1022).\n2.4 Stewardship\n\nAs introduced in the previous two sections, one might think that the\nconcept of cultural property places an emphasis on ownership where\nwhat is really required is stewardship. For instance, one might think\nthat \u201ccultural property does not really belong to\nanyone\u2026that all of us have a duty towards cultural property\nbecause of its relative scarcity and profound significance\u201d\n(Harding 1997: 760). This kind of view might be shared by those who\naim to prioritize the preservation of cultural property (Warren 1989;\nMerryman 1994) or those who think we have special duties to cultural\nheritage grounded either in the virtues (James 2013) or an\ninter-generational social contract (Thompson 2000a; though stewardship\nshould not necessarily be equated with preservation (Harding 1997:\n771)).\n\nWhile the concept of stewardship might solve certain problems\nconcerning cultural property by uniting contestants over ownership\naround a common aim, it is also liable to inherit transposed versions\nof some of the same problems. For instance, advocates of stewardship\nmust contend with what and whose values will guide stewardship\nefforts. What exactly should be stewarded, why, and for the sake of\nwhom? If, for instance, scientific or world heritage values take the\nlead, stewardship models can invite the same kinds of objections as\nuniversalist notions of cultural property that leave inadequate room\nfor the purportedly special relationship between particular cultural\ngroups and objects, or crowd out alternative value systems or sources\nof knowledge (Wylie 2005). These concerns can perhaps be avoided\nthrough a non-monolithic understanding of stewardship that\nacknowledges rights and duties for multiple parties with respect to\nsingle objects (Carpenter, Katyal, & Riley 2009), but they remain\nconcerns that advocates of stewardship models will need to address if\nstewardship is to serve as a viable substitute for an ownership model\nof cultural property.\n2.5 Intangible Cultural Property\n\nWhile the cultural property discourse began with a focus on material\nheritage (buildings, artifacts, etc.), it has expanded, particularly\nin response to increasing recognition of diverse indigenous cultures,\nto include discussion of stories, songs, styles, motifs, practices,\nand traditional knowledge (Carpenter, Katyal, & Riley 2009: 1097).\nThese additional elements, typically referred to as \u201cintangible\nheritage\u201d, present a further set of puzzles and questions for\nthe concept of cultural property (Brown 2005).\n\nCentrally, while we have a straightforward grasp on what it means to\nown an artwork or artifact, the idea of owning a story or style can\nseem relatively obscure, at least in a broadly Western context. Just\nas intellectual property law has developed to better account for\nownership of intangibles, the introduction of intangible heritage into\ndiscussion of cultural property has seemed to require appeal to the\ncategory of intellectual property to account for the ownership of\ncultural heritage that takes the form of such entities as songs or\nstyles (Nicholas & Bannister 2004; entry on\n intellectual property).\n However, the application of an intellectual property framework to\nintangible cultural property has also generated objections. First, one\nmight object that the intellectual property framework functions to\ncommodify intangible cultural heritage, which can have a\n\u201ctendency to freeze social life in time\u201d, and thus offer\nan artificial and inappropriate approach to traditions and practices\nthat are constantly changing (Brown 2005: 45). Second, general\nobjections to the suitability of legal property protections for\ncultural heritage, whether tangible or intangible (discussed in\n 2.3),\n will carry over to the use of an intellectual property framework for\ndealing with intangible heritage, either based on the idea that\n\u201cculture\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d are inherently in\ntension with one another (Mezey 2007), or because the category of\nproperty (focused primarily on rights) is inadequate to capturing the\nbreadth of cultural heritage and our duties with respect to it (Prott\n& O\u2019Keefe 1992). Third, the pull towards thinking of\ncultural heritage as universally valuable (discussed in\n 2.2)\n is arguably stronger in the case of intangible heritage than in the\ncase of material heritage. For example, if knowledge aspires to be\nfree to all, then is it acceptable to restrict its flow, even for the\nsake of guarding against the exploitation of vulnerable indigenous\ncommunities (Brown 2005)? As discussed in\n section 2.3,\n one might again counter that indigenous claims are more often for\nparticipation than outright control or rights of excludability, and\nthus such tensions are resolved if one adopts an alternative model of\nproperty that does not rely on possession of all the rights that\ncomprise the \u201cbundle\u201d of classic property rights\n(Carpenter, Katyal, & Riley 2009: 1111\u20131112). Indeed, many\nobjections to the use of intangible heritage move beyond the discourse\nof cultural property altogether, as discussed in\n section 4\n on cultural appropriation.\n\nA further puzzle is that it can be less clear what counts as a\nparticular group\u2019s intangible cultural property than it is in\nthe case of material heritage. For instance, when a museum displays\nthe cultural artifacts of a particular group, the cultural origins of\nthe artifacts are often not controversial (though they of course can\nbe): rather, controversy might surround ownership of the artifact\npredicated on a clear understanding of the culture of origin. In\ncontrast, it can be relatively harder to trace the lineages of\npractices and stories, and superficial similarities in cultural\ntraditions may lead to claims of intangible cultural property that are\nmore difficult to justify (Brown 2005: 51).\n3. Repatriation\n\nRepatriation concerns the return of material heritage or human remains\nfrom museums, universities, or other institutions to their culture,\nnation, or owner of origin. If an object was clearly stolen or\notherwise unjustly acquired from an identifiable group, then\nrepatriation can seem uncontroversial (at least from a moral\nperspective) on the basis of standard norms of reparative justice, as\nwould apply to any other stolen item. However, claims for repatriation\ncan become controversial in cases where 1) the justice of acquisition\nis unclear, 2) the source cultural group is unclear or not clearly\ncontiguous with a contemporary group, or 3) the value of institutional\nretention of disputed objects is thought to outweigh competing claims,\nespecially if these are weakened by the aforementioned concerns.\nArguments that aim to overcome these potential objections are\ngenerally couched in terms of either cultural property (3.1) or\nreparations for historical injustices\n (3.2).\n3.1 Arguments Based on Cultural Property\n\nThe general tenor of this approach is to claim that certain objects\nqualify as cultural property, and then to argue based on a particular\nfeature of cultural property that the relevant object should be\nreturned to a designated group. Given the basic notion that cultural\nproperty is just the property of a cultural group (Thompson 2003: 252;\nAppiah 2006: 118), the concept is not necessarily incompatible with\nthe alienation of particular items under appropriately authorized\nconditions of sale or transfer. However, one might appeal to cultural\nproperty as the basis for a repatriation claim if one thinks that the\nvery concept of cultural property in fact precludes such transfers\n (3.1.1),\n or, rather, if the conditions under which such a transfer occurred\nare unclear\n (3.1.2).\n For further discussion of the concept of cultural property, see\n section 2.\n3.1.1 Collective identity and the inalienability of cultural property\n\nAccording to some understandings of cultural property, the tight link\nbetween cultural property and cultural identity renders such property\ninalienable. Closer to the idea of what is sometimes called\n\u201ccultural patrimony\u201d such property might be described as\n\u201cnot something owned by a people, but something of\nthem, a part of their defining collective identity\u201d (Cuno 2001:\n85). This is one of the categories of objects, for instance, subject\nto the U.S. Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of\n1990, a federal law meant to facilitate the return of Native American\nremains and artifacts from federally funded institutions to Native\ntribes (Coleman 2010; Lackey 2006; Trope & Echo-Hawk 1992; Harjo\n1996). If cultural property is inalienable, then holdings in cultural\nproperty by those outside the cultural group are ipso facto\nillegitimate.\n\nThe idea of inalienable property is familiar from the individual\ncontext, and the link between external objects and identity often\narises in discussion of moral limits on the market distribution of\nthings such as body parts or surrogacy (Harding 1997: 749; Satz 2010;\nAnderson 1995; Sandel 2012). Indeed, the distinction between alienable\nand inalienable property is recognized in many languages and does not\ndivide across \u201cWestern\u201d and \u201cnon-Western\u201d\ncultures (Coleman 2010: 83). The claim of inalienable cultural\nproperty simply extends this concept from individuals to groups\n(Harding 1997: 751).\n\nAs a basis for repatriation, however, the concept of inalienable\ncultural property faces a series of objections. For one, we lack\nobjective standards for assessing claims that a particular item is\nfundamental to group identity (Harding 1997: 751). Second, the\nrelationship between an object and group identity need not obviously\nrequire possession of the object (Harding 1997: 751; Coleman 2010:\n89). Third, we might worry about claims concerning the necessity of\npossessing objects for group identity if a group has been separated\nfrom the object for a long time, which is especially common in\nrepatriation cases (Harding 1997: 752). Such circumstances seem to\npresent us with a dilemma: either the cultural group has persisted\nwithout the object, in which case the claim for the necessity of its\nreturn is undermined; or the object is essential to group identity, in\nwhich case the claim to be the same cultural group in its absence is\nweakened (cf. Waldron 1992). Finally, the idea that cultural identity\nmight truly be linked with an object inalienably and in perpetuity can\nsuggest a troublingly static notion of cultural group identity,\nespecially if such relationships are codified into law (Harding 1997:\n752; Coleman 2010).\n3.1.2 The inheritance of cultural property\n\nOne might claim that a cultural group can inherit cultural property,\nand thus use this to ground claims for repatriation, even where the\njustice of acquisition is uncertain: by being denied ownership of the\nobjects, the group is being denied their rightful inheritance. The\nsuccess of this approach will depend in part on whether the\ninheritance of property is morally justifiable in the first place. The\nright to inheritance seems incompatible with a number of theories of\ndomestic justice (e.g., consequentialism, egalitarianism, desert\ntheory (Thompson 2002: 109)), though is perhaps more easily\njustifiable if one thinks that principles of distributive justice do\nnot apply internationally: this appears to remove distributive justice\nbased rationales for denying the right to inheritance that might apply\nin the domestic context (Butt 2009: 141\u2013145). Given that many\nrepatriation claims are often international, this leaves more room for\nthe applicability of inheritance-based repatriation claims than might\nbe thought to apply in domestic cases.\n\nHowever, one might insist that a necessary condition for inheritance\nis the existence of testamentary wishes concerning that inheritance,\nbased on the presupposition \u201cthat respect for testamentary\nwishes lies at the core of the concept of inheritance (Young 2007:\n115). Because it is rarely the case that demonstrable testamentary\nwishes regarding cultural property can be identified, one might think\nthat inheritance is therefore unlikely to provide a basis for cultural\nproperty claims (Young 2007: 113\u201315; 2006: 18\u201320).\nHowever, an alternative approach starts by noting that it is generally\nassumed that children and spouses should inherit holdings even in the\nabsence of testamentary wishes (Thompson 2002: 125; Butt 2009: 165).\nThus, one might think that a parallel assumption should be made in the\ncase of cultural property, especially if the alternative is the\ncontinued possession of the property by a community that unjustly\nacquired it from one\u2019s own (Butt 2009: 166). In cases where an\nobject is not already regarded as cultural property, inheritance might\ntherefore also explain how the property of an individual can become\nthe property of the state (Butt 2009: 166), or perhaps of a non-state\ncultural group.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the assumption that inheritance must\nbe based on testamentary wishes is in tension with the point (noted in\n section 1.2)\n that inheritance is commonly taken to be the core notion of the\nconcept of cultural heritage (for further discussion, see Shelby 2007:\n172\u2013176). Thus, skepticism about the possibility of inheritance\nwould seem to undermine the very possibility of cultural heritage, a\nconclusion that might seem absurd. Of course, one might counter that\ncultural heritage relies on a different notion of inheritance than the\njurisprudential understanding of inheritance most appropriate to\ncultural property. However, as with the discussion of the\n\u201cparadox of cultural property\u201d above\n (2.3),\n this claim appears to rest on assuming a particularly strong\nunderstanding of ownership that the concept of cultural property may\nnot require (Carpenter, Katyal, & Riley 2009).\n3.1.3 Cultural property and cultural significance\n\nAccording to some commentators, the significance of an object for a\ncultural group is a necessary condition for it to qualify as cultural\nproperty: an insignificant object would not qualify merely because it\nwas produced by a group member (Thompson 2003: 253). Moreover, though,\nthe value of an object for a particular culture might be thought to\nconstitute the strongest basis for a moral cultural property claim.\nFor instance, according to the \u201ccultural significance\nprinciple\u201d a cultural group\u2019s claim on an object\n\u201cwill be proportional to the value the property has for members\nof the culture\u201d (Young 2007: 122) and mitigated by other\ncompeting considerations, including the range of other values\npossessed by such objects (including economic, scholarly, etc.; Young\n2013). However, the fact that the ownership of cultural property is\noften disputed by multiple cultural groups, seems to present this\napproach with a serious practical hurdle: insofar as these disputes\ntend to arise precisely when objects are highly valued by multiple\ncultural groups, the cultural significance principle will have limited\nvalue in resolving these competing claims (Thompson 2013: 89).\nMoreover, it may not be sufficiently sensitive to the legitimacy of\nother kinds of moral and legal property claims. If the cultural\nsignificance principle is indeed treated as the strongest basis for a\ncultural property claim, this suggests that a cultural group simply\nvaluing an object highly could override the legal claims of legitimate\nacquisitions and holdings (Thompson 2013: 89). Granted, the cultural\nsignificance principle is intended as just one principle that must\nalso be weighed against \u201cthe rights of purchasers, finders and\nmakers\u201d (Young 2007: 122), and it is acknowledged this will\noften be a difficult task. But independently of this difficulty, the\nprinciple might facilitate claims by cultural groups that acquired an\nobject unjustly and/or are themselves culturally distant from its\noriginal maker and cultural context, provided that they value it\nhighly enough (Thompson 2013: 89). It is in this way friendly to\narguments about how historical injustices can be superseded based on\nthe role and value that unjustly acquired objects can come to have in\nthe lives of their current owners (Waldron 1992; entry on\n intergenerational justice).\n Whether or not such outcomes are objectionable will no doubt depend\non further consideration, but might at least be criticized for\nupholding the status quo of unjust colonial acquisitions.\n3.2 Arguments Based on Reparations\n\nInstead of resting claims for repatriation on appeals to cultural\nproperty, one might instead argue that repatriation is required as a\ncomponent of reparations for historical injustices: in particular, for\nthe unjust acquisition of cultural property, and for the unjust\ncampaigns of colonial occupation and genocide in which such\nacquisitions were embedded. Because many repatriation claims concern\nobjects that changed hands during previous generations, reparations\nfor unjust acquisition or the unjust treatment of the former owners\ncan seem to provide a suitable framework for justifying repatriation.\nMoreover, because humans remains are typically not considered subject\nto private ownership (Bj\u00f6rnberg 2014: 464), reparations might be\nthought to offer a more fitting framework for repatriation cases\nconcerning remains than a cultural property framework. Interestingly,\nhowever, many of the objections that can be raised against the\ncultural property approach apply to the reparations approach as well.\nThis section will focus only on reparative issues that are especially\npertinent to repatriation (for further discussion of reparations, see\nentries on\n reconciliation,\n intergenerational justice, and\n black reparations).\n For a general argumentative framework for repatriation as reparations\nto be successful, it needs to demonstrate that some entity has an\nobligation to correct an historical injustice, that reparations are an\nappropriate form of correction, and that repatriation is an\nappropriate means of reparations (Bj\u00f6rnberg 2014: 463).\n3.2.1 Unjust acquisition\n\nIt appears that the first step in a reparative argument will be to\nestablish that an object was unjustly acquired. Failure to do so would\nseem to undermine the reparative basis for a repatriation claim of\nsuch an object: if an object was not unjustly acquired, then a\nrepatriation claim based on the reparation of an historical injustice\ndoes not appear to apply (Bj\u00f6rnberg 2014: 464). This might be\nthought of as an additional burden faced in reparation-based\nrepatriation cases in particular: more general arguments for\nreparation often involve compensation as opposed to restitution (Perez\n2011; though notably not in the case of land claims (Simmons 1995)),\nsince what is being compensated for is typically pain, suffering, and\nloss of economic opportunity. However, one might alternatively think\nthat repatriation could be justified as part of a reparative\nobligation to a cultural group even if there is no justifiable claim\nto ownership of a particular object, but simply as a form of\ncompensation for historical injustices against the group in general,\nespecially given the inextricable relationship between these broader\ninjustice and the more specific case of cultural property acquisition\n(Harding 1997: 739; Ypi 2013: 187; Thompson 2013: 90\u201391; Ypi\n2017; Matthes 2017: 946\u2013950). If this is correct, then the\nreparative approach has an important advantage over appeals to\ncultural property: it can avoid the problem of establishing unjust\nacquisition of a particular object.\n3.2.2 \u201cLegitimate descendants\u201d and cultural continuity\n\nA successful case for repatriation as reparations requires a\njustifiable account of to whom an object should be returned. In the\ncontext of reparations, this requires identifying the\n\u201clegitimate descendants\u201d of the original victims of the\npast injustice of wrongful acquisition (Bj\u00f6rnberg 2014: 465;\ndrawing on Boxill 2003). Although repatriation cases sometimes involve\nindividuals or families (as in cases concerning the return of items\nseized by the Nazis), most repatriation claims addressed in the\nliterature concern wrongs against, and return to, nations or cultural\ngroups. Identifying the legitimate descendants of the original victims\nmight depend on tracing a causal chain of harms from the original\nvictims (Boxill\u2019s \u201charm argument\u201d) or based on the\ninheritance of compensation that was owed but never made\n(Boxill\u2019s \u201cinheritance argument\u201d). One route to\nemploying the inheritance argument in this context is to appeal to\nbonds of common culture in order to identify the relevant inheritors\n(Bj\u00f6rnberg 2014: 466). However, this approach raises the same\ncultural group problems of cultural continuity\n (2.3)\n and cultural essentialism\n (4.2.3)\n that confront other topics in heritage ethics. Using the harm\nargument, on the other hand, or an alternative application of the\ninheritance argument, would require appeal to some variety of\ncontinuity, but this would not necessarily be equivalent to cultural\ncontinuity (Matthes 2017: 937). For instance, one might be able to\ntrace a chain of harms between an original victim group and a later\ngroup, even if the later group has undergone radical cultural\nchanges.\n3.2.3 Value for humanity\n\nEven if the rightful recipients in repatriation claims can be\nestablished, a further objection to reparation-based repatriation may\nstill be pressed. This is the objection that repatriation is not\njustified all things considered because countervailing considerations\n(Young 2007: 122), particularly concerning the value of retaining\nobjects in public and/or academic settings, outweigh the reasons in\nfavor of it (Thompson 2004). This kind of objection often appeals to\nthe purportedly universal value of cultural heritage discussed in\n section 2.2.\n In the case of artifacts, this may be construed as an aesthetic,\ncultural, or historical value that renders such objects inherently\npublic (Lindsay 2012). Assuming, for instance, that encyclopedic\nmuseums have an important value, some worry that repatriation would\nlead to the gutting of these collections, though whether or not such a\nworry is justified, particularly on the basis of slippery slope\narguments, remains questionable (Joyce 2003). In the case of human\nremains, this universal value claim often takes the form of scientific\nvalue, as in the much-discussed dispute over the \u201cThe Ancient\nOne\u201d (or \u201cKennewick Man\u201d; Thompson 2013: 95;\nWhittaker 1997; Brown 2003; TallBear 2013). Disputes over human\nremains, particularly of indigenous peoples, are thus often framed in\nterms of a conflict between religion and science, where it is often\nthought that the former should give way to the latter (Thompson 2013:\n95\u20136). However, an alternative framing of the dispute notes that\nburials possess a wide range of legal protections, and so Native\nAmerican repatriation claims are not based so much on religious\ngrounds as on pursuit of equality of treatment (Harding 1997: 765).\nOne might also argue that precisely because many museums are committed\nto serving as trustees of universally valuable collections for all\nhumankind, they should be more concerned with achieving a just\ndistribution of such cultural resources, in contrast with the\nretentionist position that they often take such commitments to support\n(Thompson 2004: 558\u2013559; Matthes 2017).\n4. Cultural Appropriation\n4.1 What is Cultural Appropriation?\n\nCultural appropriation is generally understood as the taking or use of\nthe cultural products of \u201ccultural insiders\u201d by\n\u201ccultural outsiders\u201d (Young 2005: 136). Cultural products\ncan range widely, including stories, styles, motifs, artifacts,\nartworks, traditional knowledge, as well as representations of the\nmembers of a particular culture (Young 2008: 4; 2005: 136; Scafidi\n2005). Questions about cultural appropriation thus often arise in a\nbroad array of artistic contexts (in particular, but not limited to,\nmusic and fashion) as well as other non-artistic contexts, such as\ncostumes, hairstyles, cuisine, and traditional knowledge (Young &\nBrunk 2012).\n\nThe concept of cultural appropriation can be used in either a\ndescriptive or normative sense, and so it is important to be attentive\nto how it is being employed in a particular context. By comparison,\nconsider how \u201cexploitation\u201d can have a descriptive or\nnormative sense (Valdman 2009: 2): you can exploit an opportunity to\nget a snack when the food truck unexpectedly arrives without this\nimplying wrongfulness. Likewise, some writers invoke cultural\nappropriation in a descriptive sense that leaves open whether a\nparticular act of appropriation is wrongful (Young 2008: 18), whereas\nothers employ the normative sense in order to pick out a particular\nkind of wrongful action (Todd 1990: 24).\n\nDisputes over cultural appropriation often have an important racial\ndimension, as in discussions surrounding the blues or hip hop (Rudinow\n1994; Taylor 1995; Taylor 2005). However, this need not be the case.\nFor instance, cultural appropriation (whether wrongful or not) could\nbe thought to arise with respect to cultural groups that cut across\nmultiple racialized groups, such as cultures surrounding disability,\nsexual orientation, gender identity, and religion, as well as arising\nwithin the diverse cultural groups that are circumscribed by a single\nracialized category (Matthes 2016a: 356). In whatever context it\narises, it is generally recognized that an essential ingredient in\nwrongful appropriation is a background of social inequality between\ncultural insiders and cultural outsiders (Ziff & Rao 1997: 5;\nHurka 1999: 184; Hladki 1994). Indeed, given the way in which dominant\ncultural groups tend to assimilate minority cultures, it may even be a\ncategory mistake to speak of members of marginalized cultural groups\n\u201cappropriating\u201d from dominant ones (Rogers 2006:\n480\u20131). That being said, some commentators argue in favor of\nleaving conceptual space for the appropriation of objects or practices\nby marginalized groups, though construed in a beneficial as opposed to\nharmful light (Walsh & Lopes 2012).\n\nA substantial catalyst for academic and popular discussion of cultural\nappropriation (particularly in Canada) was the recommendation in 1992\nof an ad hoc committee of the Canada Council to take cultural\nappropriation into account in its decisions about the award of arts\ngrants (Rowell 1995: 138). Concerns about government funding for work\nabout culturally marginalized peoples made by non-group members are\ntheoretically consistent with finding cultural appropriation\nunobjectionable if it succeeds in the marketplace of its own merits\n(Rowell 1995: 141). However, in more recent years, public and\nscholarly discussion has shifted beyond this narrower question about\ngovernment funding towards more general discussion of whether cultural\nappropriation is wrongful.\n4.2 What Might be Wrong with Cultural Appropriation?\n4.2.1 Offense\n\nOne potential source of the wrongfulness of cultural appropriation is\nthat it can be offensive to cultural group members. If this is the\nsole explanation of wrongful cultural appropriation, then the case is\nrelatively weak: the prima facie reason for thinking that\nappropriation is wrong could be easily defeated by any number of\nmorally significant countervailing factors. While there may be a\ngeneral presumption against needlessly offending others, the fact that\nsomeone might be offended by most anything makes run-of-the-mill\noffense seem relatively easy to justify.\n\nThe prima facie wrongfulness of cultural appropriation\nbecomes weightier if we think that beyond causing mere offense, it can\ncause what Joel Feinberg terms profound offense: \u201can\noffense to one\u2019s moral sensibilities\u2026[that] strikes at a\nperson\u2019s core values or sense of self\u201d (Young 2005: 135).\nNevertheless, even if cultural appropriation is profoundly offensive,\nand thus there is a prima facie reason for thinking it is\nwrongful, one might still think that it can be morally permissible all\nthings considered because of other morally relevant features of the\nact, such as its social value, the value of freedom of expression, the\ntime and place of the act, the extent to which it is tolerated by\ngroup members, and how reasonable the offense is (Young 2005). Given\nthe diversity of values and sensibilities, the potential for profound\noffense is substantial across many domains of social life. While it\nwill be debatable under what circumstances the aforementioned features\ndefeat the prima facie reasons for thinking that profoundly\noffensive appropriation is wrong, the range of cases in which it is\noften thought that profound offense is outweighed by other values\nsuggests that cultural appropriation will often be morally\npermissible, all things considered (Young 2005: 138). Indeed, one\nmight think that cultural appropriation is an essential aspect of\ncultural development, and in fact a beneficial aspect of cultural\ncreativity and exchange (Young 2008; Rogers 2006; Heyd 2003).\n4.2.2 Harm\n\nIn contrast with (or complementary to) the explanation in terms of\noffense, one might also think that cultural appropriation can be\nwrongful because it can cause harm. Analogously to debates about\nharmful vs. offensive speech, if cultural appropriation is harmful,\nthis would raise the bar for countervailing considerations that would\nbe sufficient to render it morally permissible: while harm can be\nmorally justified, there is a strong presumption against causing harm\n(see entry on\n freedom of speech).\n\nSo what might make cultural appropriation harmful? For one, it might\nbe thought to be wrongfully exploitative, defined, for instance,\nas\n\n\nthe appropriation of elements of a subordinated culture by a dominant\nculture without substantive reciprocity, permission, and/or\ncompensation. (Rogers 2006: 477)\n\n\nFor instance, one might think that when cultural outsiders profit from\nthe cultural achievements of insiders who are themselves excluded from\nsuch opportunities due to cultural marginalization and socio-economic\ninequality, they do so unfairly (Keeshig-Tobias 1990; Root 1996; Brown\n2005). Whether or not cultural appropriation is economically harmful\nto cultural group members is a difficult empirical question, and\ncertain cases may suggest that it could be an economic boon (Young\n2008: 114\u201318; Cowen 2002; Shelby 2007: 194). However, even if we\nassume for the sake of argument that cultural appropriation increases\neconomic opportunity for group members, it might still be thought of\nas a form of mutually advantageous exploitation: the features of\nexploitation identified above could persist even in the presence of a\nnet gain in economic opportunity. For instance, one common argument is\nthat cultural appropriation is an instance and extension of\ncolonialism, sharing in its exploitative extraction of labor and\nresources from those with less relative power, and thus does not treat\ncultural group members in a way that recognizes their equality and\nautonomy: culture can be appropriated in the same way that land was\nappropriated by European colonists (Todd 1992, 1990; Coombe 1993;\nRogers 2006; though against the similarity with land and natural\nresources, see Shelby 2007: 193\u20134; for more on explaining the\nwrong of colonialism, see Ypi 2013; see also entry on\n colonialism).\n Moreover, given the ways in which colonial powers often mandated the\neradication of cultural practices, especially for indigenous people,\nthrough, for example, outlawing ceremonies and languages and forcing\nassimilation through residential schools, the prospect of\nsimultaneously benefiting from these same cultural products can seem\nparticularly perverse (Coleman, Coombe, & MacArailt 2012: 178;\nChild 1998).\n\nNow, one might think that whether cultural appropriation qualifies as\nexploitative in these ways will hinge on the viability of a concept of\ncultural property, which, as we saw in\n section 3,\n remains contentious. The thinking is that cultural group members do\nnot have a right to cultural products (nor to an audience for them,\nalong with whatever economic boons it might hold) absent a claim to\nsuch products as their cultural property (Young 2008: Ch. 4). It would\nthus be no more exploitative to use or profit off of cultural products\nthan it is to use or profit off of math: no one has an exclusive right\nto it. On the other hand, one might think the claim of exploitation is\nfitting even in the absence of claims about cultural property.\nBuilding on the colonial narrative, if Urban Outfitters, for instance,\nprofits off the sale of clothes with Navajo patterns while the people\nof the Navajo nation grapple with poverty and its related injustices\n(an ongoing case that came to a head in 2012), then we might\ncharacterize this relationship as exploitative even absent a cultural\nproperty claim (though note that, in fact, the Navajo name is\ntrademarked). This is because the relationship seems to have two\nfeatures that are commonly invoked as jointly sufficient for wrongful\nexploitation: deriving an unfair or opportunistic gain from a\nvulnerable group who cannot reasonably consent (Liberto 2014; Valdman\n2009). Granted, questions remain about the application of the\nexploitation framework. For instance, we might wonder about the\nconditions under which a group could reasonably consent to the use of\ncultural products (though see Lackey 2017), or whether the case above\nis correctly construed as the kind of transaction to which charges of\nexploitation apply (one might claim that Urban Outfitters is not\ncorrectly described as transacting with the Navajo people at all).\n\nA further set of harms often invoked in discussions of cultural\nappropriation are the harms of misrepresentation and silencing.\nMisrepresentation can take many forms. For instance, it can present a\nculture in a false or misleading light. It can traffic in prejudices\nand stereotypes. It can also present a small aspect of a culture (even\nif accurate) as representative of the whole, creating a caricature, or\npresent a cultural practice in a context that perverts its meaning\n(Coleman, Coombe, & MacArailt 2012). Cultural appropriation can\nalso silence members of marginalized cultural groups by skewing public\nunderstanding of cultural expertise away from group members and\ndenying group members opportunities and platforms for cultural\nexpression (Keeshig-Tobias 1990; Todd 1990; Hladki 1994; Coombe 1993).\nThese effects can cumulatively lead to the erosion of cultural forms\nand cultural assimilation of group members (Coleman 2001). Indeed, in\nlight of these effects, some argue that cultural group members may\nhave a political obligation to engage in cultural practices for the\nsake of cultural preservation (Jeffers 2015).\n\nThe related harms of misrepresentation and silencing can be fruitfully\ncouched in terms of philosophical work on epistemic injustice and\nepistemic violence (Fricker 2007; Dotson 2011; Matthes 2016a; Nicholas\n& Wylie 2013). Operating against a broader backdrop of social\nmarginalization, cultural appropriation can inhibit or deny the\nability of group members to speak for and represent themselves,\noffering further support for Loretta Dodd\u2019s definition of\ncultural appropriation as the opposite of cultural autonomy (Todd\n1990). For instance, on this understanding, the disability rights\nslogan \u201cnothing about us without us\u201d can be construed as\nan objection against appropriation through representation.\n\nHowever, these accounts of harmful appropriation are subject to\nphilosophical objections. For instance, we might grant that\nmisrepresentation can be harmful, but deny that such a harm has\nanything to do with appropriation per se: misrepresentations\npromulgated by cultural insiders can be harmful, too (Young 2008: Ch.\n4). Thus the argument that misrepresentation is harmful does not\nestablish that cultural appropriation itself is harmful. In reply, one\nmight note that while misrepresenting oneself and being misrepresented\nby others could be equally harmful, that does not entail that they\nconstitute the same kind or degree of wrong. Moreover, we might\nquestion whether it is important to demonstrate that cultural\nappropriation is a sui generis kind of wrong: indeed, given\nthat harmful cultural appropriation seems to depend on background\nconditions of social inequality, we might think it would be\nunsurprising if a fitting explanation of its wrongfulness overlaps\nsubstantially with the explanation of other wrongs that depend on\nsocial inequality (Matthes 2016a).\n4.2.3 The problem of cultural essentialism\n\nA further persistent objection to the aforementioned accounts of\nwrongful cultural appropriation concerns the problem of cultural\nessentialism, the idea that cultural group membership can be defined\nin terms of a specific set of necessary and sufficient conditions\n(Young 2005). The problem arises because the very concept of cultural\nappropriation seems to be predicated on distinguishing cultural group\nmembers from non-members:\n\n\nThe need to describe a community of insiders and outsiders is implicit\nin most of what has been said about the practice of\nappropriation\u2026some test of group belonging seems required in\ndiscussions about cultural appropriation. (Ziff & Rao 1997: 3)\n\n\nThe objection to essentialism can take both an epistemic/metaphysical\nform and a moral form in the context of cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, one might contend that essentialist definitions of culture are\nempirically false: cultures do not have rigid boundaries (Patten 2014:\nCh. 2). Even if we granted for the sake of argument that cultural\ngroups could be carved at the joint, we might doubt our ability to\nknow what the correct cultural group boundaries are (Young 2005:\n136\u20137). If either of these objections holds, it seems as if the\nidea of cultural appropriation is at best inapplicable in practice,\nand at worst, conceptually confused.\n\nOn the moral front, one might worry that objections to cultural\nappropriation reify cultural group boundaries in a way that can\nexclude precarious or marginalized group members, or construct\ncaricatures or even oppressive conceptions of cultural authenticity\n(Killmister 2011; Rogers 2006; Shelby 2002: 249\u201354). This can\ngenerate the same kind of harmful cultural misrecognition as cultural\nappropriation itself (Matthes 2016a: 355\u2013358).\n\nThese two sets of objections are aptly encapsulated in Alan\nPatten\u2019s \u201cdilemma of essentialism\u201d for\nmulticulturalism:\n\n\nEither culture is understood in an \u2018essentialist\u2019\nway, in which case multiculturalism is empirically and morally flawed;\nor culture is understood in a nonessentialist way, but the\nconcept no longer supplies multiculturalism with the means of making\nthe empirical judgments and normative claims that matter to it.\n(Patten 2014: 39)\n\n\nCultural essentialism generates a similar dilemma for cultural\nappropriation. How best to solve this dilemma remains an open\nquestion. The answer will depend in part on how best to address more\ngeneral questions about cultural essentialism, and essentialism about\nconceptual categories more broadly (see entry on\n essential vs. accidental properties).\n Moreover, given the use of cultural categories in many everyday\ncontexts, we should be hesitant about inferring from worries about\nessentialism that cultural categories do not exist, or should not be\nemployed, just as objections to racial essentialism should not\nnecessarily lead us to dismiss all talk of racialized categories,\nespecially as a tool for accurately characterizing the effects of\nracism (see entry on\n race).\n Indeed, such assumptions can generate their own harms, for instance,\nby dismissing claims to cultural identity and autonomy on the basis\nthat they are \u201cessentializing\u201d (Todd 1992). But it can\nseem that some theoretically viable understanding of cultural group\nmembership that can survive the metaphysical, epistemological, and\nmoral objections mentioned above is essential to a robust defense of\nthe concept of cultural appropriation. One possible alternative is to\neschew the problem of cultural group membership by shifting our\nattention away from determining who counts as a cultural outsider and\ntoward the background conditions of social marginalization and\ninequality that make cultural appropriation harmful (Matthes 2016a:\n362\u2013366). However, this approach may be inadequate in certain\ncases where identifying specific acts of cultural appropriation is\nitself morally important.\n5. Heritage and Environmental Preservation\n\nWhether or not one favors a distinction between cultural and natural\nheritage (see\n section 1.5\n above), the idea of heritage plays an important role in recent\nthinking about environmental preservation.\n\nAmong the many reasons that one might think that nature is valuable\ninclude the idea that natural things have a certain kind of history,\nin particular, a history independent of human intervention (Elliot\n1982). This belief leads to the conclusion that, at least with respect\nto this particular kind of natural value, environmental restoration is\nimpossible: one cannot restore a history free of human intervention\nthrough human intervention. Thus, if we want to retain this kind of\nvalue, we need to pursue policies of environmental preservation that\nwill protect the natural spaces that bear it (Elliot 1982).\n\nThe sharp distinction between nature and culture represented in this\nview has been criticized from many fronts, for reasons ranging from an\noverly narrow perspective on environmental value to minimizing the\nactual history, and present extent, of human influence on the\nenvironment (Cronon 1995; O\u2019Neill 2002; Scoville 2013; Heyd\n2005). That being said, we might grant that Elliot identifies\nan important environmental value, provided that we do not\nmake the mistake of thinking it is the only one (Matthes 2016b). This\nwill of course significantly temper the power of Elliot\u2019s\nnormative conclusions about the promise of environmental restoration.\nBut a more nuanced understanding of the distinction between nature and\nculture, one that recognizes a broader spectrum rather than a strict\ndichotomy, can still provide reasons for cultivating a respect for\nnature\u2019s self-directedness or \u201cspontaneity\u201d as well\nas reason to preserve and protect this natural heritage (Heyd 2005:\n345). Other approaches to environmental preservation also leverage the\nheritage value of the environment, though emphasizing the cultural\ndimensions of this heritage as well as the \u201cnatural\u201d\nones.\n\nFor instance, one might think that recognizing that the environment is\npart of our cultural heritage can ground distinctive reasons or\nobligations to preserve it (Thompson 2000a). For instance, viewing\naspects of the environment as part of a cultural inheritance from our\nancestors might offer reason to preserve the environment as part of an\nintergenerational social contract (Thompson 2000a,b); or, because\n\u201cparticular places matter to both individuals and communities in\nvirtue of embodying their history and cultural identities\u201d\n(O\u2019Neill, Holland, & Light 2008: 2\u20133) we might think\nour approach to environmental preservation and decision-making should\nbe guided in part by the question: \u201cWhat would make the most\nappropriate trajectory from what has gone before?\u201d\n(O\u2019Neill, Holland, & Light 2008: 156); or, we might\nrecognize that\n\n\nindigenous peoples have long advocated that the conservation and\nrestoration of native species, the cultivation of first foods, and the\nmaintenance of spiritual practices require the existence of plants and\nanimals of particular genetic parentage whose lives are woven with\necologically, economically and culturally significant stories,\nknowledges and memories. (Whyte 2017)\n\n\nOn views like these, despite their differences, to recognize the\nheritage-dimension of the environment is to see its value as\nconsisting, at least in part, in its narrative significance, its role\nin stories that connect us to the past and contribute a distinctive\nmeaning to our lives (Holland 2011; Thompson 2000a; Scoville 2013). To\nsee environmental preservation as guided by the preservation of\nnarrative value can thus have significant implications: for instance,\npreserving narrative value might in fact entail changes to the\nphysical landscape required for preserving meaning rather than\nmaterial continuity or authenticity (O\u2019Neill, Holland, &\nLight 2008: 157; Arntzen 2008).\n\nHow best to capture that narrative value in practice is a difficult\nquestion. For instance, in places that have a history of varied use\n(what some have called \u201clayered landscapes\u201d) how do we\nadjudicate among competing narratives (Hourdequin & Havlick 2011,\n2016)? Rather than the traditional \u201cbaseline problem\u201d for\necological restoration, according to which any particular historical\nbenchmark for returning a space to its \u201cnatural\u201d state\nappears arbitrary (Lee, Hermans, & Hale 2014), we are faced with\nthe problem of deciding how a plurality of historical values ought to\nshape restoration and preservation efforts. Thus, in order to\nunderstand how best to preserve narrative value, it seems we will need\nindependent standards for adjudicating among the value of competing\nnarratives (McShane 2012). This is particularly important given the\nunequal distribution of power in crafting and promulgating historical\nnarratives, which is liable to leave many place-narratives untold or\nunheard (McShane 2012: 60; Palmer 2011: 355\u20136).\n6. Other Topics in Heritage Ethics\n\nThe previous sections discussed topics in heritage ethics that have\nseen the most engagement to date from philosophers. The following\nsubsections offer a brief overview of some other topics in heritage\nethics that have been discussed in the literature.\n6.1 The Ethics of Display\n\nBeyond issues concerning the repatriation of art and artifacts,\nfurther ethical questions arise about how cultural heritage that is\nretained in museums should be displayed. These questions play out\nagainst the backdrop of how non-Western artworks have been regarded in\nthe context of Western art institutions, vacillating between\nrelegation to anthropological museums that challenged their art-status\nto de-contextual display in modern art museums that deprived them of\nrelevant cultural context (Eaton & Gaskell 2012). Analogous to\ndebates about cultural appropriation discussed in\n section 4,\n museums are sometimes challenged for misrepresenting non-Western\ncultures, or lacking relevant participation from cultural group\nmembers (Brown 2009). Thus questions arise about the relative value of\ndifferent kinds of knowledge, how they are prioritized by institutions\nclaiming to steward the past, respectful display, and to whom these\ninstitutions are accountable (Wylie 2005; Pantazatos 2016, 2017;\nGaskell 2008).\n6.2 Further Issues in Archaeological Ethics\n\nSome dimensions of the issues discussed above could be considered part\nof the field of archaeological ethics (Scarre & Scarre 2006;\nVitelli & Colwell-Chanthaphonh 2006; Scarre & Coningham 2013),\nincluding aspects of the literature concerning cultural property,\nrepatriation, and cultural appropriation. However, further ethical\nissues arise concerning, for instance, the ethics of digging for\nrecreational, financial, or subsistence purposes (Hollowell 2006;\nWylie 1996), the professional responsibilities of archaeologists\n(Scarre 2014), and respect for the dead (Scarre 2003).\n6.3 The Ethics of Cultural Heritage Protection in War\n\nSome central aspects of the literature on cultural property have\narisen from discussion and policy surrounding the protection of\ncultural heritage in war, such as the Hague Convention and the Lieber\nCode (Merryman 1986). But further questions concerning the ethics of\ncultural heritage protection in war, such as the permissibility of\ncausing or allowing causalities in order to protect cultural heritage,\nor the obligations (or permissibility) of humanitarian intervention to\nprotect cultural heritage have received only a little philosophical\nattention to date (Thompson 2010; Matthes 2018).\n",
