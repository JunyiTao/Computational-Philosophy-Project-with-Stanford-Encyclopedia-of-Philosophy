During his lifetime the United States changed\nfrom a rural to an urban society, from an agricultural to an\nindustrial economy, from a regional to a world power. It absorbed\nmillions of immigrants from Europe and Asia, but faced wrenching\nconflicts between capital and labor as they were integrated into the\nurban industrial economy. As the face-to-face communal life of small\nvillages and towns waned, it confronted the need to create new forms\nof community life capable of sustaining democracy on urban and\nnational scales. Dewey believed that neither traditional moral norms\nnor traditional philosophical ethics were able to cope with the\nproblems raised by these dramatic transformations. Traditional\nmorality was adapted to conditions that no longer existed. Hidebound\nand unreflective, it was incapable of changing to address the problems\nraised by new circumstances. Traditional philosophical ethics sought\nto discover and justify fixed moral goals and principles by dogmatic\nmethods. Its preoccupation with reducing the diverse sources of moral\ninsight to a single fixed principle subordinated practical service to\nordinary people to the futile search for certainty, stability, and\nsimplicity. In practice, both traditional morality and philosophical\nethics served the interests of elites at the expense of most people.\nTo address the problems raised by social change, moral practice needed\nto acquire the disposition to respond intelligently to new\ncircumstances. Dewey saw his reconstruction of philosophical ethics as\na means to effect this practical reconstruction.\n\nDewey\u2019s ethics replaces the goal of identifying an ultimate end\nor supreme ethical principle with the goal of identifying a method for\nimproving our value judgments. Dewey argued that ethical inquiry is\nthe use of reflective intelligence to revise our judgments in light of\nthe consequences of acting on them. Value judgments are tools for\nsatisfactorily redirecting conduct when habits fail. As tools, they\ncan be evaluated instrumentally. We test our value judgments by\nputting them into practice and seeing whether the results are\nsatisfactory \u2014 whether they solve our problems with acceptable\nside-effects, whether they enable successful responses to novel\nproblems, whether living in accordance with alternative value\njudgments yields more satisfactory results. We make moral progress by\nadopting habits of reflectively revising our value judgments in\nresponse to the widest consequences for everyone of following them.\nThe conditions of warrant for value judgments lie in human conduct,\nnot in any a priori fixed reference point outside of conduct,\nsuch as God\u2019s commands, Platonic Forms, pure reason, or nature.\nDewey offers a naturalistic metaethic of value judgments, grounded in\ndevelopmental and social psychology.\n", "toc": [{"#DeveSociPsyc": "1.

Developmental and Social Psychology\n\nDewey argues that the function of value judgments is to guide human\nconduct, understood broadly to include conscious and unconscious\nbodily motion, observation, reflection, imagination, judgment, and\naffective responses. There are three levels of conduct: impulse,\nhabit, and reflective action. These differ according to how far they\nare guided by ideas of what one is doing.\n1.1 Impulse\n\nHumans begin life endowed only with impulses as motor sources of\nactivity. Impulses include drives, appetites, instincts, and reflexes.\nThey are \u201caffective-motor responses\u201d: primitive tendencies\nof movement toward some things (eyes toward human faces, hand to\ngrasping whatever is within reach), away from others (spitting out\nbitter food, averting eyes from too bright light, brushing off pesky\nflies), and even activity with no particular orientation toward\nexternal objects (stretching, rolling over, crying, fidgeting).\nImpulsive activity is not purposive. It involves no idea of an end to\nbe achieved by the activity. When a newborn sucks on its\nmother\u2019s nipple, it obtains food and thereby satisfies its\nhunger. But it has no idea that this will be a consequence of its\nsucking, and does not suck with the end in view of obtaining food (HNC\n65\u201369).\n\nDewey\u2019s choice of impulse as the original motor source of\nconduct contrasts with conventional desire-based psychology in two\nways. First, it takes activity rather than rest as the default state\nof human beings. Desires are defined by the states of affairs they aim\nto achieve. On this model, action needs to be inspired by an idea of\nsome deficit. Once the deficit is repaired, the desire is fulfilled,\nand the organism returns to a state of rest. Dewey observed that this\nmodel does not fit what we know about children. They are constantly in\nmotion even when they achieve no particular purpose in moving. They\ndon\u2019t need any end in view or perception of external lack to\nmove them (HNC 118\u20139). Second, impulse psychology stresses the\nplasticity of the sources of conduct. Desires are fixed by their ends.\nImpulses can be directed and shaped toward various ends.\nChildren\u2019s primitive impulses to move their bodies energetically\ncan be directed, through education, toward the development of socially\nvalued skills and interpersonally coordinated activity (HNC\n69\u201375).\n\nDesires or ends in view arise from the child\u2019s experiences of\nthe consequences of its impulsive activity. A newborn infant cries\nwhen it is hungry, at first with no end in view. It observes that\ncrying results in a feeding, which relieves its hunger. It gets the\nidea that by crying, it can get relief. When crying is prompted by\nthis idea, the child sees it as a means to a further end, and acts for\nthe first time on a desire (that is, with an end in view) (TV\n197\u20138). What desires the child acquires are shaped by\nothers\u2019 responses to its original impulsive activity, by the\nresults that others permit such activity to achieve. Parents who\nrespond indiscriminately to their children\u2019s crying end up with\nspoiled children whose desires proliferate without consideration for\nothers\u2019 interests. Parents who respond selectively shape both\ntheir children\u2019s use of means (crying) and their ends, which are\nmodulated in response to the resistance and claims of others. This\nplasticity of ends and means is possible because the original source\nof activity is impulse, not desire. Impulses demand some outlet, but\nwhat ends they seek depends on the environment, especially\nothers\u2019 responses to the child.\n1.2 Habit\n\nHabits are socially shaped dispositions to particular forms of\nactivity or modes of response to the environment. They channel\nimpulses in specified directions, toward certain outcomes, by\nentrenching particular uses of means, prescribing certain conduct in\nparticular circumstances. While individuals may have idiosyncratic\nhabits, the most important habits are customs, shared habits of a\ngroup that are passed on to children through socialization. Customs\noriginate in purposive activity. Every society must devise means for\nthe satisfaction of basic human needs for food, shelter, clothing, and\naffiliation, for coping with interpersonal conflict within the group\nand treatment of outsiders, for dealing with critical events such as\nbirth, coming of age, and death. Customary ways of satisfying needs\nshape the direction of impulse in the socialized individual. A young\nchild just starting on solid food may be open to eating nearly\nanything. But every society limits what it counts as edible. Certain\nfoods become freighted with social meaning \u2014as suitable for\ncelebrating birthdays, good for serving to guests, reserved for\nsacrifice to the gods, or fit only for animals. The child\u2019s\nhunger becomes refined into a taste for certain foods on particular\noccasions. She may recoil in disgust or horror from certain edibles\ndeemed taboo or unclean. There may have been a rationale for the\noriginal selection of foods. Perhaps some food was deemed taboo when\nits consumption was followed by a natural disaster, and people\nconcluded that the gods were angry at them for consuming it. But the\nhabit of avoiding it may persist long after its original rationale is\nforgotten (E 39\u201348, HNC 15\u201321, 43\u20137).\n\nWhile habits incorporate purposes and socially meaningful ideas, they\noperate beneath the actor\u2019s consciousness. Once people have\nlearned how to achieve some purpose through habit or skill, they no\nlonger need to tend to what they are doing. Habits, by receding from\nawareness, conserve people\u2019s reflective resources, make their\nactivity fluid, and enable them to reliably produce results in stable\nenvironments. People\u2019s habits embody their characters (HNC\n33\u201343, 50\u20132).\n\nBecause they operate subconsciously, habits may continue after their\noriginal rationale has been forgotten or repudiated. Because they\nentrench modes of conduct rather than ends in view, they may produce\nunintended results when the environment changes. We can reliably\nproduce alternative results only by acquiring a new habit. Discovering\nthe means required to change habits requires psychological and\nsociological inquiry, not just conscientiousness and willpower. It is\nmagical thinking to suppose that we can change habits through\nconscious willing, when we lack knowledge of the means of change. Nor\ncan we check their operation through monitoring, since they operate\nbehind our backs. (HNC 21\u201332).\n\nHabits tend to be difficult to modify because people form emotional\nattachments to them, and prevailing ideologies represent current\ncustoms as right. Dewey placed his hopes for change in the education\nof youth. Because children have impulses not yet channeled into rigid\nhabits, they are better able to open up opportunities for change,\nprovided their education instills habits of independent thought,\ncritical inquiry, experimentation, and imagination, including sympathy\nwith others (DE; HNC 127\u20138). Such education can make habits\nthemselves more intelligent \u2014 flexible and responsive to\nchange.\n1.3 Intelligent Conduct\n\nThe need to reflect intelligently on one\u2019s conduct arises when\nthe usual operation of habit or impulse is blocked. Customary means\nmay be lacking; changed circumstances may make habits misfire,\nproducing disturbing consequences; the social interaction of groups of\npeople with different customs may produce practical conflicts that\nrequire mutual adjustment. Blocked habits lead people to deliberate on\nthe problem posed by their situation. Deliberation is a thought\nexperiment that aims to arrive at a practical judgment, action upon\nwhich is expected to resolve one\u2019s predicament. Deliberation is\nmore intelligent, the more articulate the definition of one\u2019s\nproblem in light of more observant uptake of its relevant features,\nthe more imaginative and feasible are proposed solutions, the more\ncomprehensive and accurate the estimate of the consequences of\nimplementing them, and the more responsive is the choice to its\nexpected consequences. As the individual gets more practice in\nintelligent conduct, the dispositions that make it up become habits\n(HWT 196\u2013220).\n2. Metaethics of Value Judgments\n\nDewey held that value judgments guide conduct by way of propositions\nsubject to empirical testing. Value judgments can be both\naction-guiding and empirically warranted because they have an\ninstrumental form. They say that if something were done, then certain\nconsequences would follow, which would be valued. The point of\nasserting such propositions is to intelligently guide the design and\nselection of a course of action that will solve a problem, where the\nassertion is part of the means by which the action is brought about\n(LJP 16\u201317). Value judgments figure in Dewey\u2019s psychology\nin relation to the distinction between valuing and evaluation, and\nDewey\u2019s notions of desire, taste, and interest.\n2.1 Valuing vs. Evaluation\n\nDewey\u2019s metaethics is grounded in the distinction between\nvaluing and evaluation (also denoted as \u201cprizing\u201d vs.\n\u201cappraising\u201d, or \u201cesteeming\u201d vs.\n\u201cestimating,\u201d). Dewey\u2019s term \u201cvaluation\u201d\ncovers both valuing and evaluation. Valuing, prizing, and esteeming\ndenote \u201caffective-motor attitudes,\u201d, with more emphasis on\n\u201cmotor\u201d than \u201caffective.\u201d Valuing is a matter\nof loving or hating, liking or disliking something, where these\nattitudes involve tendencies to act (LJP 23\u201327). In his later\nwork, Dewey embraced a more uncompromising behavioristic view of\nvaluing that questioned the attribution of inner emotional aspects to\nvaluing (TV 199, 202\u20133).\n\nAt the most primitive level, valuings are tendencies to move toward,\nacquire, or ingest certain things, or, on the negative side, to avoid,\nreject, spew out other things. One need not have any idea of what one\nis valuing in order to value it. Hence, they are less sophisticated\nthan desires, which have propositional content (an end in view) and\narise from practical reflection (TV 207). In the first instance,\nvaluings denote impulses toward or away from objects, as when an\ninfant turns toward human voices, or swats away a fly. Valuings of\nobjects as useful can also be immediate \u2014 that is, not mediated\nby cognition or awareness of what one is doing. One uses a fork to\npick up food, without thinking about it. Habits, then, are also a\nspecies of valuing.\n\nDewey contrasted valuings, which are mostly behavioral, from the\nphilosophical idea of a pleasure or enjoyment, understood as an\nisolated and passive experience. Dewey criticized that idea as arising\nfrom philosophical demands not grounded in experience (LJP\n40\u20131). In reality, when we enjoy something, as when we savor an\nice cream cone, we are actively engaged with it: we roll the ice cream\naround on our tongues, chew the cone, taking note of its texture and\nflavor, explore it on all sides. These activities, not just passive\nexperiences, are part of the pleasure of eating an ice cream cone.\n\nValuings may be expressed in ejaculations. A child may jump up and\ndown, saying \u201c goody! \u201d at an ice cream cone. As a\nspontaneous and uncalculated ejaculation, \u201c goody \u201d does\nnot express a value judgment. The child may say the same thing with\nself-awareness, as if to say \u201cI like ice cream.\u201d Such a\nsubjective report of a valuing still does not express a value\njudgment.\n\nValue judgments arise when valuings are subjected to\nevaluation or appraisal, when one asks the question whether\n(one ought) to value (seek, cherish, consume, etc.) something (TV\n208\u20139; VORC 84\u20136).\n\nThus, value judgments are practical judgments. Although they may have\na descriptive form (\u201cx is good,\u201d\n\u201cx is right\u201d), the constitutive point of making\nthem is to alter or guide our valuings. The need to question our\nvaluings arises when immediate action on them is not possible or\nyields unsatisfactory consequences. There is no more ice cream in the\nrefrigerator; is it worthwhile to go to the store to buy some more?\nOr, the lactose-intolerant person may observe that she gets a stomach\nache after eating ice cream, and discover that ice cream is the cause.\nShould she just give up ice cream, can she take something that avoids\nthe symptoms, or are there lactose-free substitutes? Having sketched\nout some alternative solutions to her predicament, she imaginatively\nfills out the details of acting on them, including their projected\nconsequences (Do the pills have side effects? Does the lactose-free\nice cream taste good?). The consequences are the objects of valuings,\nwhich guide the formation of a new end-in-view, a new valuing \u2014\nsay, to go for lactose-free ice cream, because taking pills would be\nbothersome, and the lactose-free ice cream tastes just as good. The\ncomparative value judgment (\u201ceating lactose-free ice cream is\nbetter than taking pills with regular ice cream, or eating regular ice\ncream alone\u201d) is practical because its function is to guide\nconduct toward the best solution to the person\u2019s problem.\n\nThus, value judgments or appraisals result in new valuings. This fact\nhas two implications, one for the nature of valuing, the other for the\nassessment of value judgments. First, when valuings change in response\nto value judgments, they become desires, interests, or tastes. Second,\nbecause the function of value judgments is to constitute new valuings\nthat solve the individual\u2019s predicament, they can be assessed\ninstrumentally, in terms of how well they perform that function.\n2.2 Desires, Interests, and Tastes.\n\nIn the ice cream case just described, the lactose-intolerant person\nwas initially consuming ice cream out of impulse or habit, without\nthinking about it. Her conduct was caused by unreflective valuings.\n(In reality, Dewey stressed, hardly any of the valuings of adults are\nwholly primitive, as the valuings of infants are. So the illustration\nis only of a relatively unreflective valuing, one that incorporates a\nrelatively low level of understanding of the consequences of acting on\nit.) When she became aware of the fact that her consumption of ice\ncream was causing a problem, she investigated the problem,\narticulating its contours, with the aim of solving it, of finding some\nalternative that would \u201cwork,\u201d in the sense of enabling\nthe satisfactory resumption of activity. \u201cWorking\u201d need\nnot mean finding an alternative means to resuming the same valued\nactivity. Her activity has changed: now she aims to consume\nlactose-free ice cream. Her valuation activity has changed\nboth in the object toward which it is directed, and in its cognitive\ncharacter: it embodies an articulate understanding of what she is\ngoing after, which reflects her appraisals of its merits.\n\nThe result of such appraisal is the adoption of an end-in-view, the\ninstitution of a desire. Dewey\u2019s term\n\u201cdesire\u201d is closer to our \u201cintention\u201d or\n\u201cpurpose\u201d or even \u201cplan\u201d (TV 238) in denoting\na tendency toward action that the agent has adopted, rather than\nsimply a motive clamoring for our attention or moving us behind our\nbacks. Desire denotes a reflective, conscious valuing, not a mere\n\u201caffective-motor\u201d attitude, but an\n\u201caffective-ideational-motor activity,\u201d a\n\u201cunion of prizing and appraising\u201d (TV 218). It is a\ncognitive state. As the individual engages this new valuation, she\nexperiences the consequences of acting on it. Reflection upon these\nconsequences is then incorporated into more intelligent valuations, by\nway of further appraisals. The result of criticism is the refinement\nof taste \u2014 that is, a \u201crational liking\u201d (VEK 15), a\n\u201cliking for a reason\u201d (VORC 95). The novice and the\nconnoisseur may both value (like) the same object. But the latter has\na reflective and articulate grasp of the features of the object that\nare liked, plus enough experience with valuations of objects of that\ntype to have warranted confidence that these features merit liking.\nThat is, the connoisseur has enough experience to warrant confidence\nthat there are not further features of the object or consequences of\nvaluing it which, once appreciated, would reverse or detract from the\nliking. Desires (ends-in-view) do not exist in isolation from each\nother. We reflect on the consequences of attempting to jointly satisfy\nour desires. Appraisals of such consequences serve to modify desires\nso that they are coordinated with one another. Dewey called such\nsystematically coordinated desires \u201cinterests\u201d (TV\n207).\n2.3 Value Judgments as Instruments\n\nDewey characterized value judgments as instrumental in three senses\nthat he did not explicitly distinguish. The first we may call the\nconstitutive function of value judgments. The point of appraisal, of\nmaking a value judgment, is to bring about the resumption of unified\nactivity, when the normal course of activity has been interrupted by a\nproblematic situation (TV 221\u20132). This situation incites\nhesitation and doubt about what to do. Dewey\u2019s point is that\nvalue judgments are essentially practical judgments. They aim to guide\naction, not just to passively describe things as they are. Making the\njudgment is the necessary means to deciding on a new course of action\nthat will solve the problem (LJP 14\u201316).\n\nSecond, the content of value judgments is about the value of actions\nand objects as means \u2014 that is, their value in relation\nto their consequences, or the consequences of valuing them in the\nsituation at hand. Value judgments have the form: if one acted in a\nparticular way (or valued this object), then certain consequences\nwould ensue, which would be valued (VEK 11). The difference between an\napparent and a real good, between an unreflectively and a reflectively\nvalued good, is captured by its value not just as immediately\nexperienced in isolation, but in view of its wider consequences and\nhow they are valued. The ice cream seems good to the\nlactose-intolerant person; it is immediately prized by her. But it is\njudged to be not really good in view of the intolerable consequence of\nconsuming it. Value judgments place things in their wider context and\njudge them in relation to their consequences, more fully considered\n(TV 209\u2013213).\n\nThird, while the proximate and constitutive end of a value judgment is\nthe resumption of activity that has been interrupted by a problematic\nsituation, judgment has a remoter end, of using the action decided\nupon as a means for uncovering new evidence about what to value.\nIntelligently made value judgments are held provisionally and\nhypothetically, with an eye toward revising them if the consequences\nof acting on them are not found valuable. So viewed, value judgments\nare tools for discovering how to live a better life, just as\nscientific hypotheses are tools for uncovering new information about\nthe world (VEK 19\u201326; VORC 88\u20139).\n2.4 Experimental Confirmation of Value Judgments\n\nDewey\u2019s pragmatist moral epistemology follows from his\ninstrumental account of value judgments. It is uncontroversial that\ninstrumental judgments are subject to empirical testing and\nconfirmation, since they involve empirical claims about causation. We\ntest scientific hypotheses by bringing about their antecedents and\nseeing if the results are as they predicted. Similarly, we test value\njudgments by acting on them and seeing if we value the consequences in\nthe way the judgment predicted. Acting on our value judgments \u2014\nputting them into practice \u2014 supplies the data for confirming or\ndisconfirming them. Roughly speaking, a value judgment hypothesizes\n\u201ctry it, you\u2019ll like it\u201d \u2014 a statement easily\nsubject to empirical verification and refutation. Intelligent value\njudgments proceed not by random trial-and-error, but from skilled\nprojection of prior confirmed \u201ctry-like\u201d regularities to\nanalogous novel situations, which are continuously modified in light\nof experiences of the wider consequences of trying in these new\nsituations.\n\nDewey derived several unsettling implications for traditional morality\nand traditional philosophical ethics from his moral epistemology.\nTraditional or conventional morality tries to enforce unquestioning\nobedience to its precepts. Dewey argued that this was a formula for\nperpetual immaturity, because it cut off all possibility of learning\nbetter ways to live by experimenting with them. Pragmatist moral\nepistemology also rejects philosophy\u2019s a priori,\ndialectical methods for determining the good and the right. One cannot\nprove that something is valuable by mere argument. Arguments, at best,\nmake certain value judgments plausible as hypotheses \u2014 and even\nthen, only if grounded in experience and reflection on the wider\nconsequences of acting on them. Ultimately, the hypotheses must be\ntested, by seeing how one values the actual results of putting them\ninto practice. It follows that the dogmatism of traditional\nphilosophical ethics is folly. It hobbles progress in life. Even the\nbest confirmed value judgments can hold only provisionally.\nCircumstances change, thereby modifying the consequences of acting on\nparticular evaluations. Change requires us to revisit our original\nappraisals with an eye toward modifying them in light of these new\nconsequences (RP). Moreover, we don\u2019t know the consequences of\ntrials not performed. It is therefore always possible that we are\nmissing out on better modes of conduct that we haven\u2019t tested,\nor even imagined (VEK 25\u20136).\n2.5 Contextualism\n\nDewey\u2019s moral epistemology is contextualist. The form of a\ncontextual standard of value is: it solves the problem encountered in\nthis situation (better than other imagined or tested solutions). A\nperson may articulate the problematic features of her situation in\nvarious ways: as obstacles, confusions, conflicts, unmet needs,\ndangers, and so on. The test of a value judgment \u2014 whether it\n\u201cworks\u201d \u2014 is whether it successfully identifies an\naction that overcomes the obstacles, clears up the confusions,\nresolves the conflicts, satisfies the needs, avoids or eliminates the\ndangers, and so on. The standard of success for value judgments is\nthus developed internally to the practices at hand, relative to\npeople\u2019s descriptions of their problems (HNC 199, 208; RP\n173\u20134). Of course, hypothesized solutions may fail in practice.\nThis may lead agents to revise their understandings of their problems,\nrather than just trying alternative solutions to the same problems.\nFor example, the failure of a course of therapy may lead a doctor to\nreconsider the original diagnosis. The problematic features of\nsituations are not given. Identification of the problem begins in\noften inchoate experiences of doubt, confusion, apprehension,\nfrustration, distress, anger, conflict, and so forth, which call for\narticulate diagnosis. Such diagnoses or descriptions of problems are\nopen to further refinement and even radical revision in light of\nexperimental testing in tandem with proposed solutions.\n\nIn upholding contextualism, Dewey rejected the idea that standards of\ncorrectness for valuing could be devised external to practice. He\nrejected any conception of intrinsic value as some kind of existence\nor property that has value in itself, regardless of context, which is\nthe object of practice to bring about, realize, or conform to.\nAsserting the existence of such values tears the practice of making\nvalue judgments out of the contexts that give them meaning and point.\nThis does not mean that one cannot make meaningful general value\njudgments. Some problems and solutions are of a generalized sort,\nencountered in many situations that vary widely in their details.\nAbstract, general value judgments may therefore be useful in a wide\nrange of situations. But this does not mean that they point to values\nthat exist outside of practice (TV 230).\n3. Means and Ends\n\nThe standard objection to Dewey\u2019s instrumental theory of value\njudgments is that it concerns the value of things as means only, and\nnot as ends. It fails to fix on what is ultimately important:\nintrinsic values or final ends. Some ultimate end outside of practice\nmust be postulated as given, as the standard against which the value\nof acts as means can be judged, lest we fall into an infinite regress.\nWe either need some conception of a summum bonum, justified\napart from practical reasoning, toward which acts must aim, or\nDewey\u2019s theory reduces to a form of Humean instrumentalism, in\nwhich ends are given by our desires or immediate likings, and the only\nquestion is how to satisfy them.\n\nDewey\u2019s reply to this objection goes to the heart of his moral\nphilosophy. He argued that the character and value of means and ends\nwas reciprocally determined. We do not first already have an end in\nview, with the only question how to achieve it. We lack a complete\nconception of our end until we have a complete grasp of the course of\naction that will take us there. Moreover, a judgment of the value of\nends apart from the means needed to get there, and apart from the\nvalue of ends as means \u2014 as things that have consequences of\ntheir own \u2014 cannot provide the basis for rational action. Acting\non such radically truncated judgments would be crazy. Our judgments of\nthe worth of an end are inextricably tied up with our judgments of the\ncosts of achieving it, both in terms of the means needed to get there\nand the unintended consequences of getting there. Practical judgment\nis creative: it institutes new ends-in-view. It is transformative:\nappraisals affect our immediate valuings of things.\n3.1 Reciprocal Determination of Means and Ends\n\nThe occasion for making value judgments is a problematic situation, in\nwhich one\u2019s activity is blocked and one does not know what to\ndo. At first, the problem is experienced as uneasiness and hesitation.\nReflection is needed to articulate what experience signals as a\nproblem. A complete description of the problem to be solved is\nsimultaneously the articulation of a complete solution, a unified\ncourse of action identifying a series of steps (means) resulting in an\nend, which the judger predicts will be found valuable as a\ncomplete package. A person is walking to a lake but stops upon\nreaching a deep ditch. She entertains possible courses of action,\nwhich are simultaneously preliminary descriptions of problems and\nsolutions. (\u201cI need to jump across\u201d; \u201cI need to\nbuild a bridge\u201d). These incomplete descriptions prompt the\ngathering of new data to articulate them further (\u201cCan I jump\nthat far?\u201d \u201cIs there a log around?\u201d). A complete\ninvestigation yields a joint description of the problem and its\nsolution (\u201cI need to drag this log across here, the narrowest\npart of the ditch, and walk across.\u201d) (HWT 200\u20136).\n\nThe value of the end depends on the costs and benefits of the means,\nand the costs and benefits of the further consequences to which the\nend is judged as a means or cause. In the preceding example, it might\nappear that a certain final end \u2014 getting to the lake \u2014 is\ngoverning deliberation. But this is so only provisionally. A full\ninquiry into the means needed to achieve the end may lead to a\nre-evaluation of the end itself. (\u201cThe only log able to bridge\nthe ditch is narrow at the end; I have bad balance; I would be\nseriously injured if I fell off the log. Getting to the lake\nisn\u2019t so attractive after all \u2026.\u201d). Furthermore,\nreaching the end has anticipated consequences of its own (\u201cThat\nbear on the other side of the ditch looks hungry\u2026.\u201d) that\nmay modify the valuation of the end (\u201cIt\u2019s better if I\nstay on this side.\u201d). It is irrational to take one\u2019s end\nas fixed before investigating the costs of the means and the\nconsequences of achieving the end (TV 214). Thus, the standard model\nof instrumental reasoning, which takes ends as fixed and inquires\nsolely into the means needed to satisfy them, is inadequate. The point\nof inquiring into means, and into ends considered as means or causes\nof further consequences, is not merely to determine how to achieve an\nend, but to appraise the value of the end itself (TV 210\u201319; VEK\n4\u20137).\n3.2 Practical Judgment is Creative\n\nThe preceding considerations show that practical judgment is creative:\nit institutes new ends-in-view, new desires. Against Dewey\u2019s\nclaim of creativity, it might be objected that Dewey\u2019s theory of\npractical reasoning still presupposes certain values. In the ditch\ncase, the original end would not have been rejected but for the\nagent\u2019s fear of injury. Dewey agrees that \u201cjudgment at\nsome point runs against the brute act of holding something dear as its\nlimit\u201d (LJP 46). Without some prizings that are not themselves\nsubject to appraisal at the time of deliberation, there is nothing to\nguide practical reasoning. Yet these very prizings may be subject to\nappraisal at some other time, perhaps even as a consequence of acting\non them on this occasion.\n\nOne might still object that this is not enough to show that practical\njudgment is genuinely creative. Perhaps it just takes given prizings\nand determines the end through some kind of vector addition, taking\ntheir weights as given. If a man is out to buy a suit, for instance,\nhe approaches the problem with a given set of habitual priorities\n\u2014 for example, that durability and cheapness are more important\nthan style. The man\u2019s choice of suit thus merely reflects the\nweights of the man\u2019s already given priorities. But if this were\nall there was to choice, then deliberation would hardly be necessary.\nHe would simply inspect the prized qualities of the available suits,\nand let impulse determine his choice from there. In fact, Dewey\nargued, deliberation assigns weights to different prized\nqualities in the context of choice, rather than taking them as given.\nWe can\u2019t really tell how much weight to put on this or that\nprized quality until we see it instantiated in combination with the\nother qualities in the set of alternatives, and consider further how\nthe suit with its qualities will function as a means in the future.\nAlthough the man may be used to prizing durability in a cheap suit,\nand placing little weight on style, this suit is to be used for job\ninterviews, which are expected to land him a much higher paying job.\nThis use of the suit gives him several reasons to alter the habitual\nweights he assigns to suit qualities. Anticipating that he will soon\ncome to prize style more, once he is able to afford it, he may decide\nto borrow against the future and go for the expensive stylish suit\nnow, so that he will still prize it after he lands the job. Or he may\ndecide that he needs to make an especially good impression in order to\nland the job, so that he must weight style more heavily than cheapness\nnow. Or he may decide that he\u2019ll only need to use this suit\nonce, to get a job, and after that his tastes will change\ncommensurately with his income, but in ways he can\u2019t know ahead\nof time. Hence, he should not count durability as an important value\nhere. Evaluation remains creative even granting that it presupposes\ncertain prizings, because it is still up to us to assign weights to\nprized qualities in light of the novel features of the context. Prior\nweightings cannot determine current ones, since the former may be\nmaladapted to the new situation (LJP 30\u20135; VEK 10\u201320).\n3.3 Practical Judgment is Transformative\n\nPractical reasoning does not merely generate new appraisals; it\ntransforms our prizings. This is the point of Dewey\u2019s theory of\ncriticism and taste. Judgments of the merits of prizings feed back\nonto our primitive prizings and transform them. They not only make\nthese prizings more articulate (a union of prizing and appraising); in\nmaking us more vividly aware of the features of the object that we\nprize, they alter the directions of our prizings (VEK 4\u20139). As a\nresult of deliberation, the man who needs the suit comes to prize\nstyle, say, more than he did before, and cheapness less. Nor is this\npossibility of transformation limited to what are conventionally\nunderstood to be \u201cinstrumental\u201d values. Whether a quality\nsuch as style is \u201cintrinsic\u201d or \u201cinstrumental\u201d\nis not built into the nature of the quality itself, but a function of\nhow it is regarded by the individual at the time. Instruments may be\nprized in themselves (as when we admire a particularly finely balanced\ntool). More importantly, stylishness may immediately attract \u2014\nbe immediately prized \u2014 but it also has its uses in impressing\nsome prospective employers, and its unintended consequence of turning\noff others (who may think it important in an employee not to show\noff).\n3.4 Practical Judgment and Character\n\nAgainst Dewey\u2019s instrumental theory of value judgments, one\nmight object that sometimes we appraise valuings as intrinsically good\nor bad. We might judge that prizing another\u2019s suffering is\ndespicable, apart from its consequences. Dewey rejected the sharp\ndistinction between character and action, motive and consequence, that\nthis picture presupposes. A character trait is a tendency to pursue\ncertain ends, and so must be appraised in terms of its typical\n(intended) results. Thus, we condemn schadenfreude primarily because\nit leads to cruelty. At the same time, conduct has among its\nconsequences a tendency to reinforce the character traits that caused\nthem, or to consolidate into a character trait its direction of\nimpulse. Conduct constitutes the moral self. So, we properly condemn a\nsingle manifestation of schadenfreude \u2014 say, laughing at\nsuffering caused by a natural disaster \u2014 even if it, in itself,\ndid nothing to increase anyone\u2019s suffering. This is the truth\nthat moralities of intention grasp, which narrowly consequentialist\ntheories do not (E 173\u20135, 286\u20139).\n\nOne who holds that evil attitudes can be bad in themselves, apart from\ntheir consequences, would want to say more than this. Dewey can say\nmore, too. He would agree that we do not value attitudes only\ninstrumentally. We immediately prize some attitudes and despise\nothers, in the sense that we directly prize and despise them without\nfirst appraising them instrumentally. A sympathetic person immediately\nhates expressions of schadenfreude without first checking whether they\nactually caused anyone to suffer. Such valuings can themselves be\nsubject to appraisal. If we endorse them upon reflection on their\nconsequences, we judge that they are merited (see the section on\n Virtue Theories\n below). Among the most important consequences of such second-order\nvaluings are their impact on our characters: they tend to reinforce\nthe attitudes that are prized, and make us recoil from the attitudes\nthat are despised, leading us to seek means to change those attitudes.\nDewey denies that there is any sensible way to appraise character\ntraits apart from their typical consequences. So there is no getting\naway from consequences altogether. However, his theory has the\nresources to (a) condemn particular manifestations of bad attitudes,\neven when they do not have their typically bad direct consequences,\n(b) immediately (\u201cintrinsically\u201d) despise them, (c) judge\nthat such immediate condemnations are warranted, and thereby (d)\nconstitute new, reflective and cognitively loaded\naffective-ideational-motor attitudes of condemnation. His theory can\nmake parallel claims for prizings and appraisals of good\nattitudes.\n\nThus, we begin with immediate valuings or prizings of things. Such\nprizings have no cognitive content. When we ask whether something\nought to be valued, we enter the domain of appraisal or value\njudgments. To appraise something is to judge it in relation to the\nmeans required to attain it, and as a means or cause of further\nconsequences. Appraisal, then, is fundamentally about means. However,\nsuch appraisals transform our original prizings. If we discover that\nthe cost of attaining something prized is too high, we prize it less\n(reduce or eliminate our tendency to go after it). If we discover that\nattaining it has further, disvalued, consequences, we also prize it\nless. If attaining it has further, prized consequences, or if the\nmeans to attain it are themselves prized, we value it even more. Now\nthe valuing has cognitive content, and is articulately directed to\nthat content. Now we value or disvalue something under a description\n(the ice cream as cause of stomach ailment, the suit as stylish and\nimpressive to prospective employers, the schadenfreude as despicable).\nThe appraisal of things as means feeds back into our prizing of things\nas ends.\n4. Moral Theories: the Good, the Right, the Virtuous\n\nTraditional normative moral theories generally fall into three types.\nTeleological theories seek to identify some supreme end or best way of\nlife, and reduce the right and the virtuous to the promotion of this\ngood. Deontological theories seek to identify a supreme principle or\nlaws of morality independent of the good, and subordinate the pursuit\nof the good to conformity with the moral law. Virtue theories take\nphenomena of approval and disapproval to be fundamental, and derive\nthe right and the good from them. Dewey declined to offer substantive\nanswers to the traditional questions posed by these theories, arguing\nthat no fixed ends or moral rules could be adequate in a world of\nconstant change and plural and conflicting values. In place of fixed\ngoals and rules of action, Dewey offered his method of experimental\ninquiry, which he argued was shared between theoretical and practical\nreason (RP 174). He drew insight from traditional moral theories by\nrecasting their substantive answers to traditional moral questions in\nmethodological terms.\n\nDewey also rejected the reductionist tendencies of these theories,\narguing that each drew from an independent source of evidence about\nwhat one ought to do. Teleological theories draw from the efforts of\nthe individual agent to distinguish the real from the apparent good,\nand to harmonize conflicting impulses by subsuming them under a\ncomprehensive conception of the good. Deontological theories draw from\nthe efforts of groups of people to harmonize and adjudicate the\nconflicting claims they make on one another by means of impartial\nlaws. Virtue theories draw from the praise and blame people accord to\neach others\u2019 conduct. Resisting the tendency of philosophical\nethics to represent the grounds of these theories in metaphysical\nterms, Dewey insisted that the sources of evidence for these three\ntypes of theory were empirical. Teleological theories are based on the\nreflective desires of the individual; deontological theories on the\nsocially authorized demands of interested others; virtue theories on\nthe spontaneous tendencies of observers to approve and disapprove of\npeople\u2019s conduct. These sources of evidence for different sorts\nof moral claims are independent from the others. None carries\nautomatic or conclusive authority. Hence, the tension among the three\ntypes of moral consideration is permanent and cannot be resolved by\nreducing one to another or insisting that one automatically overrides\nthe others (TIF). Resolution of conflicts among these considerations\ndepends on the context in which they arise.\n4.1 Theories of the Good (Teleological Theories)\n\nWe have already seen that Dewey casts the distinction between the\napparent and the real good in terms of what is valued immediately in\nimpulse and unreflective habit, and what is valued reflectively as an\nobject of intelligent desire. Dewey insisted on the primacy of the\nreflective method of inquiry over settling on fixed answers to\nquestions about the good. This can be seen in his critiques and\nmethodological reinterpretations of the three types of theory of\ngoodness dominant today: hedonism, ideal (objective list) theories,\nand informed desire theory.\n\nHedonism supposes that the value of acts can be reduced to the\nquantity of pleasure and pain they produce. Estimating such values\nrequires that we be able to break down the pleasures and pains of\ndifferent activities and experiences into simple identical units, and\nthen sum them up again. This theoretical demand outruns the holistic\nand complex character of our experiences of pleasure and pain (LJP\n40\u20131). Pleasures and pains in reflective individuals are\ninextricably bound up with what Dewey called \u201cideational\u201d\nfactors \u2014 that is, with articulate conceptions of what they are\ntaking pleasure in. They are therefore not pure sensory units but\nalready contain elements of judgment or appraisal. Critical among\nthese are considerations of the consequences of prizing certain things\nfor one\u2019s own moral character. Since we form our character by\ncultivating habits of valuing some things over others, and we prize\nand appraise character itself, we cannot simply take current pleasures\nas given (E 193\u20134; LJP 41\u20132). Good and bad people take\npleasure in different things. Such facts can give us reason to\ncultivate different tastes from those we currently have.\n\nAlthough hedonism fails as a theory that gives us a fixed end, it does\ncontain a methodological insight. Nothing is good that cannot be\ndesired. All desire contains an element of enjoyment or liking. Hence,\npleasure can be seen as a sign of the good, as evidence of what is\nvaluable. Nevertheless, what makes desire a sound guide to the good is\nthe fact that it incorporates foresight and reflection on the wider\nconsequences of acting on it, not just that it incorporates a liking\nof its object (E 195\u20136).\n\nIdeal or objective list theories attempt to harmonize conflicting\ndesires not, as hedonism does, by reducing them all to a common\ndenominator, but by systematically fitting them together into an ideal\nor plan of life. Dewey argued that people construct ideals that make\nsense in view of their particular social circumstances. For example,\nideals of material or political advancement make sense of the\nstrivings of business people and politicians. Such ideals have, at\nbest, only contextual validity and cannot be prescribed as fixed ends\nfor all people. There can no more be a single best way of life than\nthere can be an ideal house for all times and places. To suppose that\nthere is forecloses the possibility of imagination inventing something\neven better. Yet, ideals serve a highly important function for\nindividuals, if they are considered as hypotheses about how one should\nlive that one can test in experiences of living in accordance with\nthem. So understood, ideals are tools for discovering evidence about\nthe good (LE 59\u201368, 229\u201330; E 185, 189\u201391,\n202\u2013210).\n\nInformed desire theories of the good, which define the good in terms\nof what an individual would desire if fully informed, come closest to\nDewey\u2019s own account. Dewey spoke of the good as the object of\ndesires of which we approve in calm, informed reflection (E 208, 212).\nYet Dewey\u2019s aims differ from that of most of today\u2019s\ninformed desire theorists. The latter tend to accept as fixed the\ncharacter of the individual whose good is being judged, and alter only\nthe individual\u2019s cognitive capacities and beliefs so as to read\noff the good for the individual from what his cognitively enhanced\nself wants. This commits the same error that Dewey charged against\nhedonism, of omitting critical appraisal of one\u2019s own character\nas an important factor in determining what one ought to desire. In\nidentifying the good with the objects of approved desires, Dewey\nhighlighted the importance of character to identifying the good.\nBefore we can endorse a desire, we need to ask whether we, or an\nimpartial observer, could approve of someone who had it (E\n239\u201347). The good is what good people \u2014 those possessing\nforesight and wide sympathies \u2014 desire. Dewey also resisted the\nconversion of a method of inquiry into a fixed criterion of value.\nThere is never an end to inquiry \u2014 no such thing as complete\ninformation \u2014 because circumstances are always changing and\nimagination constructs new possibilities for living (E 213). Nor does\nthe projection of desires we would have if we reached an end to\ninquiry offer a recognizable vision of human life. Fully informed\npeople do not desire more information. But education, inquiry, and\nindividual development in light of new discoveries are constitutive\ngoods of human life. The desire to skip to the end to see what is\nultimately valuable is a desire to skip human life, as if the process\nof learning through living were merely a means and not prized in\nitself (HNC 194\u2013202). What, in light of inquiry, we reflectively\ndesire, and approve of desiring, is evidence of what is good. But it\nis always defeasible in light of further inquiry.\n4.2 Theories of Right (Deontological Theories)\n\nPragmatism in ethics is often regarded as a form of teleology or\nconsequentialism. Yet Dewey rejected accounts of the right that\ndefined it in terms of promoting the good (E 214\u2013216). The\nconcept of the right contains an element not contained in the good\n\u2014 namely, that of an authoritative demand. The phenomenology of\nclaims of good and right are also distinct: the good attracts or\nappeals, whereas claims of right appear to command authority. The\ndemands of the right often conflict with individual desire, since they\narise from the conflicting, socially authorized claims of other\npeople. The right arises from the need to harmonize the claims of\npeople with distinct interests and conceptions of the good by means of\nreasonable principles that all can accept. Thus, although claims of\nright are grounded in people\u2019s interests in gaining the\nassistance and cooperation of others, and in protection against\nothers\u2019 encroachments, the right cannot be defined in terms of\npromoting the good of any individual. Nor can it be defined in terms\nof promoting some independent conception of the good of society as a\nwhole, since any such conception must already persuade the individual\nthat it accords a reasonable place for her own claims, and thus\nalready incorporate a notion of right (E 215\u20137; TIF\n284\u20135).\n\nThe deontological thought that the right is independent of the good\nreflects the reality that the claims of others, even when reasonable\nand authoritative, do not automatically harmonize with the desires of\nthe individual upon whom the claims are made. However, Dewey rejected\nthe further deontological claim that there is a sharp distinction\nbetween the moral and nonmoral good, where the former is identified\nwith conformity to the right, and the latter with satisfying\nindividual desires. After all, claims of right are designed to protect\nand advance the interests of individuals that are considered important\nenough to warrant social support. Moreover, they are constitutive\nfeatures of social relationships that people find good. The authority\nof these claims draws on the appeal of these relationships and on the\nmotives of love, respect, and loyalty cultivated within them (E\n218\u2013219).\n\nDeontological theories tend to identify the right either with fixed\nlaws or rules of conduct, such as the Ten Commandments, or with a\nsingle supreme principle of morality, such as the Categorical\nImperative, understood as supplying a decision procedure in ethics.\nThe attempt to specify substantive rules of right conduct for all\ncases founders on the need to make exceptions for different\ncircumstances. \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d cannot be taken at\nface value, given the justifiability of killing in self-defense. Yet\nit is impossible to specify in advance all of the circumstances that\ncould justify killing even in self-defense, given the complications\nthat arise in, say, defensive warfare (e.g., problems of collateral\ndamage). As social conditions change \u2014 for example, the\ntechnology and tactics of warfare, and our ability to affect the\ninterests of distant others \u2014 rules of conduct that had been\naccepted in the past must be subject to revision, lest learning cease\nand people remain mired in dysfunctional habits (E 275\u20139). A\nmethod of moral inquiry is needed that can revise given rules, laws,\nand habits in light of new problems and circumstances. This method\nwould take current and past customs and laws as starting points for\nmoral theory, in conjunction with the history and anthropology of\ncustom, the history of systematic theoretical reflection on morality,\nand the social sciences, which inform us of the nature of current\nproblems, and the probable consequences of attempting to institute\nthis or that new law or custom (E 178\u20139). Intelligent moral\ninquiry, while it begins with current customs and convictions about\nthe right, treats them as hypotheses to be tested in experience.\n\nThe attempt to identify a decision procedure for the right independent\nof considerations of the consequences of following certain principles\nis also bound to fail. Dewey endorsed the \u201cempty\nformalism\u201d critique of Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative,\ninsofar as it aspires to reach moral conclusions without presupposing\nanything to be good. Yet, reinterpreted as tools of moral inquiry, as\nstandpoints from which to identify and analyze morally relevant\nconsiderations, principles such as the Golden Rule and the Categorical\nimperative offer sound advice: they are designed to ensure that the\ninterests of all have been fairly considered in formulating concrete\nprinciples of conduct proposed as general laws or customs to be\ngenerally enforced (E 223\u20135, 280\u20133).\n4.3 Virtue Theories\n\nVirtue theories take approval and disapproval, praise and blame, as\nthe fundamental bases for morality. Customary morality relies heavily\non acts of praise and blame to perpetuate itself. Critical reflection\nseeks a standard by which people\u2019s approvals and disapprovals\ncan be appraised. Dewey argued that the British utilitarians carried\nthis inquiry most deeply with their ideal observer theory of morality,\nwhich identified the standard with that by which an informed impartial\nand benevolent observer appraises conduct \u2014 namely, its tendency\nto promote everyone\u2019s welfare. But, given that the content of\npeople\u2019s welfare is not fixed, but open to imaginative\nexpansion, this standard can no more be applied in algorithmic fashion\nthan moral principles can be. Like moral principles, the utilitarian\nstandard of approval sets up a general standpoint for the appraisal of\nconduct, and revision of ends in light of such appraisal, rather than\na fixed criterion that can be mechanically applied (E\n237\u201347).\n\nDewey argued that praise and blame function to make individuals\nconscious of and responsive to the wider consequences of their actions\nfor others. This forward-looking view of praise and blame enabled\nDewey to avoid the problem of free will in its connection with\nresponsibility. Praise and blame are tools for enabling\npeople to assume responsibility for their conduct \u2014 to enable\nthem to regulate their conduct in view of their consequences for\nothers. Hence, the presupposition of praise and blame is not that the\nindividual held to account could have done otherwise at the time of\nacting. It is rather that praise and blame can induce people to be\nmore conscientious \u2014 to govern their conduct in light of the\nresponsibilities ascribed to them, to act out of a sense of their own\nresponsibility, and thereby to take notice and mastery of the motives\nby which they act \u2014 in the future. This fact is most evident in\nour practices of praising and blaming children. Young children are not\nautonomous agents and lack free will in any sense relevant to the\ndebates about responsibility. They are not responsible for their\nconduct. Yet, in praising and blaming them, we hold them responsible\nfor their conduct, as the necessary means by which they can become\nresponsible for their conduct in the future. This is not a special or\nanomalous use of praise or blame; it is its paradigmatic use (HNC\n119\u201322; LE 86\u201396).\n4.4 Reflective Morality\n\nDewey\u2019s accounts of the main types of moral theory fit neatly\ninto his experimentalist account of practical reasoning and value\njudgments. Individuals begin their lives as human societies did\nhistorically: acting on impulse and custom. These modes of conduct,\nbeing unselfconscious and shortsighted, cannot handle all the\nchallenges life poses, and generate problems of their own. Thus arises\nthe need for reflective appraisal of conduct in view of its wider\nconsequences, with the aim of controlling future conduct by means of\nthese appraisals, so as to solve the problems at hand. This practical\nreasoning uses the same general experimental method as theoretical\nreasoning does. We begin with certain given facts: these are our\nimmediate valuings of things by impulse and habit. The data for\nappraisal of these valuings come from the consequences of acting on\nthem, along with the ways we value these consequences. The three types\nof moral theory identify three sources of evidence that bear on our\ncurrent valuings: our desires (which by definition are informed), the\nclaims or demands of other people, and their approvals and\ndisapprovals of our conduct. Traditional philosophical ethics tries to\nerect these sources of evidence into transcendent, authoritative\ncriteria, typically by means of certain idealizing moves (such as\nuniversalization and full information). Dewey argued that the\nsupposedly external, transcendent criteria for appraising conduct\n\u2014 ideals of the good, principles of right, standards of approval\nand disapproval \u2014 should rather be treated as hypotheses, as\ntools for uncovering additional data needed to appraise our valuings.\nThey provide us with standpoints by which we can make ourselves aware\nof a wider set of consequences of our conduct. Ideals of the good\nenable us to take up the standpoint of the prudent and foresighted\nindividual, concerned to harmonize current desires with one another\nand with the self\u2019s future needs and interests. Principles of\nright enable us to take up the standpoint of others who make claims on\nus in light of the impact of our conduct on their interests. Standards\nof approval enable us to take up the standpoint of observers, who\napprove and disapprove of our conduct not just for its consequences\nbut on account of its underlying motives as well. Thus, these norms\nenable us to survey the consequences of our conduct from a first\npersonal, second personal, and third personal point of view,\nrespectively, and to shape new ends (desires) accordingly. But no\nactual ideal, principle, or standard exhaustively captures each point\nof view, since each is subject to further development with further\nextensions of information, imagination, and sympathy. They can only be\naccepted tentatively, as hypotheses to be tested by acting on them and\nseeing what further data they elicit. Some of this data \u2014 new\nregrets, new complaints, new disapprovals \u2014 will disconfirm our\nhypotheses and provide grounds for revising our ideals, principles,\nand standards. (This is not to suggest that the import of the data\nthemselves should be taken at face value. Some regrets simply reflect\nthe resistance of old dysfunctional habits; some complaints are\nunreasonable; some disapprovals reflect hidebound and dogmatic\ndispositions. But these hypotheses, too, can be tested.) History and\nthe social sciences provide us with additional data on the customs and\nlaws by which people have dealt with the problems that have arisen in\ntheir circumstances, and general knowledge of human psychology and\nsocial interactions that enable us to learn from the experiences of\nothers and formulate educated guesses \u2014 new hypotheses \u2014\nfor how we might solve our problems.\n\nDewey stressed several themes in developing his account of reflective\nmorality for the present day: change, pluralism, conflict, and\nanti-authoritarianism. Living in an era of unprecedented social\nchange, Dewey situated reflective morality in a non-teleological\nDarwinian view of organisms\u2019 adaptation to environmental\ncontingencies (IDP). Nature does not supply a telos or rule for human\nbeings, but rather a constantly changing environment to which humans\nneed to adjust by using their intelligence. Modern science and\neducation lead people to doubt old traditions and arrive at different\nbeliefs by empowering them to think for themselves. Immigration brings\npeople of different faiths and cultures together, with a need to\ndevise shared moral norms to regulate their interactions.\nInterpersonal conflict along lines of class, religion, race, and other\nsocially salient divisions generates demands for new norms to resolve\ndisputes. All of these factors undermine appeals to traditional norms,\nwhich are not adapted to changed circumstances, presuppose a consensus\nthat does not exist, and suppress rather than address interpersonal\nconflict. Nor is resort to traditional authorities any solution.\nPeople don\u2019t agree on their authority. Moreover, authority\nitself corrupts people\u2019s moral views:\n\nIt is difficult for a person in a place of authoritative power to\navoid supposing that what he wants is right as long as he has power to\nenforce his demand. And even with the best will in the world, he is\nlikely to be isolated from the real needs of others, and the perils of\nignorance are added to those of selfishness. (E 226)\n\n\nMoral insights come from the demands of others, not from any\nindividual\u2019s isolated reflections. And insights come from all\nsocial quarters. Intelligent revision of norms therefore requires\npractices of moral inquiry that stress mutual responsiveness to\nothers\u2019 claims, and social inclusion of all members of society.\nSuch practices are constitutive features of democracy, understood as a\nform of everyday life (not simply as a type of state constitution) (CD\n224\u2013230). This is the point at which Dewey\u2019s political\nphilosophy emerges from his ethics. Democracy, in Dewey\u2019s view,\nis the means by which we practice intelligent moral inquiry together,\nseeking solutions to the problems we face together (PP).\n5. Aesthetic Value\n\nDewey\u2019s identification of intelligent reflection with\nexperimental methods might be thought to suggest a narrowly\nscientistic worldview, in which values are reduced to purely\nsubjective, arational \u201coughts\u201d or likings applied to\ninherently value-free facts or natural kinds discovered and defined\nindependently of human valuations. In fact, Dewey\u2019s project aims\nto unify scientific with humanistic inquiry rather than to enforce\ndivisions between the two. While intelligent humanistic inquiry\npartakes of experimental method, scientific inquiry itself is an art\n(EN 285\u20136). The categories in terms of which we make intelligent\nsense of the world are not limited to those which are useful solely\nfor describing objects of abstract, generalized knowledge divorced\nfrom feelings and aspirations. Feelings and aspirations are themselves\npart of the natural world and hence proper subjects of experimental\ninvestigation (EN 316). The job of art is to create objects that\nenhance our capacities for meaningful, appreciative experience.\nCriticism in turn aims to develop meaningful categories that inform\nenriched experiences of objects. \u201cNothing but the best, the\nrichest and fullest experience possible, is good enough for man\u201d\n(EN 308).\n\nFor experiences to be capable of such enrichment, they must be able to\nincorporate intelligent appraisals, just as desires and actions do. To\nthe extent that such incorporation is attentive to the features of the\nobject along with their import, so as to produce a unified, free,\nemotionally engaged, satisfying, appreciative experience of the\nobject, the experience realizes aesthetic value (AE 42\u20133, 47).\nSuch appreciative perception of the object incorporates knowledge of\ncauses and effects. \u201c[T]here enter[s] into the [epicure\u2019s]\ntaste, as directly experienced, qualities that depend upon reference\nto its source and its manner of production in connection with criteria\nof excellence\u201d (AE 55). The listener informed by music theory\nlearns to hear, and thereby take pleasure in, different types of\nmodulation from one key to another, and is thereby primed for certain\nmusical expectations, creating alternating tensions, fulfillments, and\nsurprises as the musical performance unfolds. Similar claims can be\nmade for all of the arts, whether they be \u201cfine\u201d or\n\u201cpractical.\u201d\n\nThe job of the critic is not to pass judgment on the object as a judge\nissues a decision on the basis of precedent, but rather to point out\nmeaningful features in the object in ways that enhance\nobservers\u2019 experience of it (AE 302\u20134). Nor should\naesthetic appraisal of artworks simply consist in applications of\nprior aesthetic standards to currently perceived works of art. Recall\nthat value judgments are instruments that, while they may have been\nfound useful in past cases, may fail to successfully guide current\nconduct. To the extent that a work of art is capable of evoking novel\nappreciative experiences, the application of established standards of\naesthetic value to the work may close off such novelty and reduce the\nexperience of it to a stereotyped, boring recapitulation of past\nexperiences (if the artwork happens to meet the old standard), or,\nworse (if it fails to meet the old standard) provoke a stunted\nreaction of offense or disapproval. In such cases the aesthetic\njudgment would have failed to do its job, which is to enhance\nperception by drawing the observer\u2019s attention to features of\nthe object, and of relations among the object, its creator, and\nobservers, that are understood as meaningful and thereby excite\nfeeling (AE 303). Criticism renders the aesthetic value of an artwork\nobjective to the extent that it succeeds in evoking common\nappreciative experiences among many observers by drawing their\nattention to the same features and relations of the artwork (AE\n312\u20133).\n\nOn Dewey\u2019s expansive understanding of the aesthetic dimension of\nexperience, aesthetic value is not possessed by works of art alone,\nbut can also be possessed by tools and other instruments (EN 283). In\nthe course of repairing a shelf, one might use a hammer and feel its\nheft and balance to be splendidly proportioned for the task, feel the\nhandle to be molded in a way that perfectly fits one\u2019s hand,\nperceive its materials to have been selected with attention to their\nfitness for driving nails, and so forth. Such intelligent appreciation\nof the hammer in one\u2019s direct experience of it amounts to an\naesthetic valuation of it, insofar as the experience itself is savored\nand one\u2019s perceptive faculties are not merely identifying\ninstrumentally valuable features of the hammer for future reference\nbut actively engaged in appreciating the aptness of its design and\nmaterials. The repair job, too, can have aesthetic value to the extent\nthat one experiences it as a unified, smoothly unfolding process,\nbeginning with an astute assessment of the required operations,\nleading to the skilled, fluid, unfrustrated execution of these\noperations, and ending with what is appraised and prized as a\nsuccessful conclusion--the object experienced as satisfactorily\nrepaired. When the experience of this process as aptly unifying means\nand ends absorbs one\u2019s appreciative attention, either as actor\nor as observer, it has aesthetic value.\n\nOn this account, the work process itself can have aesthetic value.\nDewey\u2019s aesthetic theory thus provides the basis for\nunderstanding his critique of work as it exists in societies sharply\ndivided by class. In such societies, the processes of work are reduced\nto merely mechanical operations assigned to a servile class, and\ndivorced from consummatory experiences of the propertied, leisure\nclass that enjoys the products of others\u2019 labor. Class division,\nby divorcing means from ends (production from consumption) and\nintelligent planning from physical operations, reduces physical labor\nto a tedious, mindless, meaningless mechanical exercise of habit,\nwhich thereby lacks aesthetic value in lacking unity and intelligent\nappreciation. The challenge of the modern day is to consider how work,\nand human activity generally, can be reformed so that it has aesthetic\nvalue and is thus no longer valued merely instrumentally (EN\n277\u20138, 307\u20138).\n6. Social Ethics\n\nConsistently with his contextualism, Dewey stressed the social\ncircumstances in which different moral theories arose. His and James\nTufts\u2019s Ethics begins, not with a review of rival moral\ntheories, but with a survey of anthropology and a brief history of the\nmoral problems and practices of the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and\nRomans. By locating moral theories in their social contexts, Dewey\nexposed their limitations. Theories that make sense in certain\ncontexts may not make sense in others. For example, Dewey argued that\nthe failure of ancient Greek teleological theories to grasp the\nindependence of the right from the good arose from the fact that the\ngood for individual citizens of Greek city-states was inextricably\nwrapped up with participation in civic life and promotion of the good\nof the city-state as a whole (TIF 283).\n\nDewey, like Hegel, stressed the ways abstract philosophical doctrines\nare socially embodied. He frequently focused on the ways these\ndoctrines rationalize and reinforce stultifying and unjust social\narrangements. For example, the sharp dichotomy between purely\ninstrumental and intrinsic goods both reflects and reinforces an\norganization of work life that reduces it to drudgery. Since work is\nof merely instrumental value, so the thinking goes, there is no point\nin trying to make it interesting to those who do it. The dichotomy\nalso rationalizes oppressive class divisions. Insofar as the good life\nis conceived in terms of devotion to or enjoyment of purely intrinsic,\nnoninstrumental goods (such as intellectual contemplation and the\nappreciation of beauty), it is a life that can be led only by a\nleisured class, whose members do not have to spend their time earning\na living. This class depends upon a working class whose function is to\nprovide them with the leisure they need to pursue the good life.\nDewey\u2019s critique of traditional ways of distinguishing means\nfrom ends is thus simultaneously a critique of class hierarchy (HNC\n185\u20138, TV 235).\n\nDewey argued that the primary problems for ethics in the modern world\nconcerned the ways society ought to be organized, rather than personal\ndecisions of the individual (E 314\u2013316). Thus, in contrast with\nhis voluminous political commentaries, Dewey published very little on\npersonal \u201capplied ethics.\u201d The rapid social changes that\nwere taking place in his lifetime required new institutions, as\ntraditional customs and laws proved themselves unable to cope with\nsuch issues as mass immigration, class conflict, the Great Depression,\nthe demands of women for greater independence, racism, and the threats\nto democracy posed by fascism and communism. Dewey was a founding\nmember of the NAACP and the ACLU. As a progressive liberal, he\nadvocated numerous social reforms such as promoting the education,\nemployment, and enfranchisement of women, social insurance, the\nprogressive income tax, and laws protecting the rights of workers to\norganize labor unions. However, he stressed the importance of\nimproving methods of moral inquiry over advocating particular moral\nconclusions, given that the latter are always subject to revision in\nlight of new evidence.\n\nThus, the main focus of Dewey\u2019s social ethics concerns the\ninstitutional arrangements that influence the capacity of people to\nconduct moral inquiry intelligently. Two social domains are critical\nfor promoting this capacity: schools, and civil society. Both needed\nto be reconstructed so as to promote experimental intelligence and\nwider sympathies. Dewey wrote numerous works on education, and\nestablished the famous Laboratory School at the University of Chicago\nto implement and test his educational theories. He was also a leading\nadvocate of the comprehensive high school, as opposed to separate\nvocational and college preparatory schools. This was to promote the\nsocial integration of different economic classes, a prerequisite to\nenlarging their mutual understanding and sympathies. Civil society,\ntoo, needed to be reconstructed along more democratic lines. This\ninvolved not just expanding the franchise, but improving the means of\ncommunication among citizens and between citizens and experts, so that\npublic opinion could be better informed by the experiences and\nproblems of citizens from different walks of life, and by scientific\ndiscoveries (PP). Dewey regarded democracy as the social embodiment of\nexperimental intelligence informed by sympathy and respect for the\nother members of society (DE 3, 89\u201394). Democracy is not simply\na set of legal institutions but a way of life informed by an ethos of\nopen and respectful communication, in which political rivals repudiate\nabusive and suspicious modes of discourse and open themselves up to\nlearning from others (CD). Unlike dictatorial and oligarchic\nsocieties, democratic ones institutionalize feedback mechanisms (free\nspeech) for informing officeholders of the consequences for all of the\npolicies they adopt, and for sanctioning them (periodic elections) if\nthey do not respond accordingly.\n\nDewey\u2019s moral epistemology thus leads naturally to his political\nphilosophy. The reconstruction of moral theory is accomplished by\nreplacing fixed moral rules and ends with an experimental method that\ntreats norms for valuing as hypotheses to be tested in practice, in\nlight of their widest consequences for everyone. To implement this\nmethod requires institutions that facilitate three things: (1) habits\nof critical, experimental inquiry; (2) widespread communication of the\nconsequences of instituting norms, and (3) extensive sympathy, so that\nthe consequences of norms for everyone are treated seriously in\nappraising them and imagining and adopting alternatives. The main\ninstitutions needed to facilitate these things are progressive schools\nand a democratic civil society. Experimentalism in ethics leads to a\ndemocratic political philosophy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<h4>Abbreviations of Principal Works Bearing on Dewey\u2019s Ethics</h4>\n<table class=\"cell-rl cellpad-med-dense vert-top\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>", "[AE]", "<em>Art as Experience</em>, in <em>Later Works</em>, vol. 10\n(1934) </tr>\n<tr>", "[CD]", "\u201cCreative Democracy: The Task before Us,\u201d in\n<em>Later Works</em>, vol. 14 (1939). </tr>\n<tr>", "[DE]", "<em>Democracy and Education</em>, in <em>Middle Works</em>, vol.\n9 (1916) </tr>\n<tr>", "[EN]", "<em>Experience and Nature</em>, in <em>Later Works</em>, vol. 1\n(1925) </tr>\n<tr>", "[HNC]", "<em>Human Nature and Conduct</em>, in <em>Middle Works</em>,\nvol. 14 (1922) </tr>\n<tr>", "[HWT]", "<em>How We Think</em>, in <em>Middle Works</em>, vol. 6\n(1910). </tr>\n<tr>", "[E]", "<em>Ethics</em>, rev. ed.(John Dewey and James Tufts), in\n<em>Later Works</em>, vol. 7 (1932). </tr>\n<tr>", "[IDP]", "\u201cThe Influence of Darwin on Philosophy,\u201d in\n<em>Middle Works</em>, vol. 4 (1909). </tr>\n<tr>", "[LE]", "<em>Lectures on Ethics, 1900\u20131901</em>, Ed.
