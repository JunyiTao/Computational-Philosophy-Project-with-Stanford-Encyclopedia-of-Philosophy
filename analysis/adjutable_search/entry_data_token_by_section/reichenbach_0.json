    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nBorn in Hamburg, Germany, in 1891, Hans Reichenbach was the second of\nfour children of a half-Jewish but baptized father and a non-Jewish\nmother. In secondary school and at university he was active in the\nsocialist student movement. From 1910 to 1911 he studied civil\nengineering at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, and then moved\namong Berlin, Munich and G\u00f6ttingen, studying physics, philosophy\nand mathematics with some of the eminences of the time, including\nErnst Cassirer, Max Planck, Arnold Sommerfeld and David\n Hilbert.[1]\n He wrote his doctoral dissertation largely on his own after the\nneo-Kantian Paul Natorp would not accept him as his student. After\nsearching for alternative advisors, his dissertation was finally\naccepted by Paul Hensel, a philosopher, and Max Noether, a\nmathematician, in 1915 in Erlangen. Reichenbach was conscripted into\nthe army while completing his thesis. He served in the German army\nsignal corps on the Russian front until a serious illness sent him\nback to Berlin in 1916. He was relieved from active military duty in\n1917 to work as an engineer for a firm specializing in radio\ntechnology. In Berlin, Reichenbach attended Albert Einstein\u2019s\nlectures on relativity and statistical mechanics, which influenced him\nprofoundly, and inaugurated a life-long friendship between the two\nmen. He wrote several popular articles defending Einstein, especially\nin the context of the observations of the solar eclipse of 1919\nconfirming the predictions of the general theory of relativity. \n\nIn 1920 Reichenbach became an instructor in physics, and eventually\nassociate professor, at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart.\nThe Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge (1920f) was\naccepted as his habilitation in physics. In this period Reichenbach\nmarried Elizabeth Lingener and they had two children, Hans Galama in\n1922 and Jutta in 1924. While in Stuttgart he developed contacts with\nMoritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap and Erwin Schroedinger. In 1926, after\nmuch back and forth, he assumed a teaching position in \u201cnatural\nphilosophy\u201d at the University of Berlin, where he remained until\nHitler came to power in 1933. During this time Reichenbach organized\ndiscussion groups on scientific philosophy, similar to those of the\nVienna Circle (see entry on\n Vienna Circle).\n The group around Reichenbach that developed out of the Society for\nEmpirical Philosophy and became known as the Berlin Group included\nKurt Grelling, Kurt Lewin, Richard von Mises and later Carl Hempel,\nReichenbach\u2019s student. Together with members of the Vienna\nCircle, Reichenbach initiated the publication of the journal\nErkenntnis in 1930 as a forum for scientific philosophy.\nReichenbach and Carnap were the only editors after Schlick resigned in\nreaction to Reichenbach\u2019s opening article (see\n Section 4.4\n below). In addition (and also for financial reasons), Reichenbach was\na frequent contributor of popular essays and a regular radio lecturer\non scientific topics. \n\nWith Hitler\u2019s elevation, the views and methods of the Berlin\nGroup and Vienna Circle were branded Jewish philosophy, and\nReichenbach\u2014who counted as Jewish to the National Socialists and\nwas in any case considered undesirable given his socialist writings as\na student\u2014was dismissed from his university position and from\nradio work. He moved to Istanbul in 1933, where, as part of his\nefforts to westernize Turkey, Mustafa Kemal (Atat\u00fcrk) had\nestablished a new university to attract intellectuals fleeing Europe.\nReichenbach was joined there by 32 other German professors, notably\nRichard von Mises, the mathematician whose views on probability must\nhave influenced Reichenbach, and Erwin Freundlich. Freundlich had been\nEinstein\u2019s assistant in Berlin on matters astronomical, led an\nunsuccessful German expedition to Russia to measure the gravitational\ndeflection of starlight at the 1914 solar eclipse (the members of the\nexpedition became prisoners of war!), and later joined the\n\u201cEinstein Observatory\u201d in Potsdam. \n\nUnder a five-year contract which prevented him from accepting a\nposition at New York University arranged by Einstein and Sidney Hook,\nReichenbach remained in Turkey until 1938, when, through the efforts\nof many people, most notably Charles Morris, Reichenbach moved to the\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with his family. Hiking\nin the Swiss Alps shortly before his move to Los Angeles, Reichenbach\nsuffered a heart attack, which prevented him from teaching during the\nfirst months of his American appointment. (Reichenbach was an avid\nhiker and skier, but not physically impressive. His student, Cynthia\nSchuster, describes his appearance around 1950 this way: \u201cshort,\nalmost rotund, stubby hands and feet, round face, snub nose, thick\nglasses, false teeth, a hearing aid, and a thin high-pitched speaking\nvoice.\u201d (Reichenbach 1978, vol. I) His influence on students,\nshe says, was a case of mind over matter.) With the US entry into\nWorld War II in 1941, Reichenbach\u2014as a resident German\nalien\u2014was kept under effective house arrest, allowed to leave\nonly to work and for medical purposes until he obtained American\ncitizenship in 1943. During the war, Reichenbach was engaged in\nhelping to move members of his family out of Germany and to secure\npositions for colleagues at UCLA, in particular members of the\nFrankfurt School\n (Theodor Adorno,\n Max Horkheimer), who with Berthold Brecht and Thomas Mann became part\nof Reichenbach\u2019s German intellectual circle in Los Angeles. In\n1939 he was reunited with Maria Moll, who had been his colleague in\nIstanbul. They married in 1946, the day after her divorce. Despite\nbitter discussions at UCLA about the McCarthy era California Loyalty\nOath, in which each faculty member had to attest that they were not\nmembers of the Communist party, we are not aware of any written\nobjections from Reichenbach. He signed the oath in 1949/50, apparently\nunwillingly, as an understanding letter from Rudolf Carnap suggests\n(McCumber 2016, p.52). Reichenbach\u2019s untimely death from another\nheart attack on April 9, 1953, prevented him from presenting the\nWilliam James Lectures at Harvard in the fall of the same year, and\nalso prevented his inclusion in a planned volume of Living\nPhilosophers in the series edited by Arthur Schilpp. \n\nFurther Reading. Much more detail about Reichenbach\u2019s\nlife can be found in the excellent biography by Gerner (1997). Volume\nI of Reichenbach (1978) contains memories and comments from many of\nReichenbach\u2019s friends, colleagues, students and relatives.\nFurther biographical detail can be found in Salmon\u2019s\nintroduction (translated to German by Maria Reichenbach) to volume 1\nof Reichenbach (1977), in Salmon (1979), in Maria Reichenbach (1994),\nin Padovani (2008) and Kamlah (2013), while The Hans Reichenbach\nCollection (linked into the Other Internet Resources section\nbelow) at the University of Pittsburgh contains a wealth of\nautobiographical notes, in particular references HR 014-33-08 and HR\n044-06-21 to HR 044-06-26. Hoffman (2007) and Milkov (2013) describe\nthe historical developments of the Berlin Group and Irzik (2011)\nprovides the same for Reichenbach\u2019s move to Istanbul. Verhaegh\n(2020) traces in detail Reichenbach\u2019s move to Istanbul and the\ndecisions and hurdles that eventually took him to the U.S.\n",
