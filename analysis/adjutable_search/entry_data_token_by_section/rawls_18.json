    "main_text": "Justice as Fairness: Justice within a Liberal Society || The Conception of Society\n4.5 The Conception of Society\n\nRawls\u2019s conception of society is defined by fairness: social\ninstitutions are to be fair to all cooperating members of society,\nregardless of their race, gender, religion, class of origin, natural\ntalents, reasonable conception of the good life, and so on.\n\nRawls also emphasizes publicity as an aspect of fairness. In\nwhat he calls a well-ordered society all citizens accept the\nprinciples of justice and know that their fellow citizens also do so,\nand all citizens recognize that the basic structure is just. The full\nphilosophical justifications for the principles of justice are also\nknowable by and acceptable to all reasonable citizens.\n\nThe idea behind publicity is that since the principles for the basic\nstructure will be coercively enforced on free citizens, they should\nstand up to public scrutiny. The publicity condition requires that a\nsociety\u2019s operative principles of justice not be too esoteric,\nand not be screens for deeper power relations. Fairness requires that,\nin \u201cpublic political life, nothing need be hidden... there is no\nneed for the illusions and delusions of ideology for society to work\nproperly and for citizens to accept it willingly\u201d (PL,\n68\u201369).\n",
