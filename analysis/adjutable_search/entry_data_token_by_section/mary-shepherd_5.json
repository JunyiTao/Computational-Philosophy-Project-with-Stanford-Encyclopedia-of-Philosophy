In\nher usage, \u201csensation\u201d is a general term for everything of\nwhich a sentient being is conscious (EPEU [2020: 6,\n133\u201360]). There are two classes of sensations: those that are\nsensible qualities (colors, figures, etc.) and sensations of ideas.\nSensations that are sensible qualities are always caused in part by\nthe use of organs of sense and attended by sensations caused by using\nthem. They have an \u201cimmediate incontrovertible evidence\u201d (EPEU\n[2020:142, 700]). Ideas, but not sensations of them, refer to things\ndistinct from sensations. Strictly speaking, an idea is \u201cthe\nresult of that reasoning or observation which shows that there must\nneeds to an existence when we cannot perceive it\u201d (EPEU [2020:\n133\u20134]).\n\nShepherd undertakes to explain three common beliefs about the objects\nof perception: their existence is continued, outside the mind, and\nmind-independent. What is to be explained is how sensations can lead\nto these beliefs about objects in view of the discrepancy between what\nwe know about the former and the properties we ascribe to the latter.\nThe first issue is: \u201cWhence we know of any continued existence,\nwhen we can immediately know nothing but our sensations\u201d (EPEU\n[2020; 20]). Sensations are interrupted, for example, by dreamless\nsleep and by their constantly arising, perishing, and being replaced.\nHer general procedure is to argue that sensations we acquire in\nexperience display various patterns that must have causes with the\nproperties just mentioned. The aim is to show that reasoning provides\nreasons, or motives. for holding the common beliefs. The reasons may\nnot have propositional form and they have various degrees of\nperspicuity, but all mentally competent human beings, regardless of\nage, are conscious of them e.g. EPEU: [2020: 16\u201317, 71, 106)].\nBecause Shepherd gives minds to all sentient organisms, they too are\nsaid to be conscious of reasons to believe the things they perceive\nare continued, external, and independent (Fasko forthcoming).\n\nWith regard to continued existence, a mass of sensations exhibits many\nseries of sensible qualities that recur. For instance when you look at\na house while walking by, you are conscious of a series of visual\nimages and if you happen to retrace your steps, the same series\nappears in reverse order. Shepherd argues that whenever we are\nconscious of a series of sensible quality sensations that is repeated,\nwe comprehend that each repetition must have a cause that continues to\nexist \u201cready to answer the irregular call of the senses\u201d\n(EPEU: [2020: 15\u201316]). Otherwise, each would have a cause\ncreated explicitly for the purpose of being ready to mix with sensory\norgans when needed; or if not, different recurrences would begin of\nthemselves. Consciousness of his reasoning enables us to have an idea\nof existence continued unperceived but only consciousness of\ninterrupted sensations (EPEU [2020: 134]).\n\nWe say we perceive \u201cexternal\u201d objects. Shepherd offers to\nclarify the difference between what is external and internal:\n.\u201cInward existence is the capacity for sensation in general;\noutward existence is the exciting cause of some sensation in\nparticular\u201d (EPEU [2020: 40]). The capacity for sensation in\ngeneral is the mind. The cause of a particular sensation results from\nthe mixing of the mind and an object that needs to be outside the mind\nin order to mix with it. Accordingly, sensations are inward,\ninterrupted, and can be known by only one subject, whereas what is\noutward has continued existence and can be perceived by more than one\nhuman being, if other human beings are possible (EPEU [2020: 40]). So\none reason to believe that the causes of sensible quality sensations\nexist outside the mind is that we infer it from the belief that they\ncontinue to exist unperceived. Others are offered as well.\n\nShepherd takes a particular interest in explaining why, despite our\nconviction that sensations exist if only if they are perceived, we\nsomehow assume that sensations exist outside the mind. For instance, a\ncolored, figured, extended object is commonly considered to exist in\nits colored, figured, extended state when it is no longer perceived.\nYet color, figure and extension are mental affections (EPEU [2020:\n39]). Shepherd denies that this can be understood or even believed\nbecause of its manifest impossibility. The doxastic performance is\nsaid to be due to our belief that the particular object that causes a\nparticular sensible quality must be outside the mind, on one hand, and\nthe paucity of our resources for recalling the object, on the other\nhand. After we perceive, say, an apple, our only way to think of it or\ndistinguish it from other objects is under the form of its sensible\nqualities. This is said to produce a natural association of thought\nthat links sensations and their causes so tightly that philosophical\nanalysis is required to pry them apart. She reports several\nextravagant and mutually inconsistent theories philosophers have\nproposed in the effort to separate sensations and objects outside the\nmind; Reid, Malebranche, Leibniz, as well as Berkeley and Hume are\nmentioned (EPEU [2020: 45\u20136]). She easily uncouples the\nassociation by stressing the difference between inward and outward\nexistence based on her theory of the relation of cause and effect\n(EPEU [2020: 71, 114]).\n\nShepherd advances three reasons that motivate belief that perceptual\nobjects are mind\n independent.[4]\n One is that we believe objects we perceive undergo change of sensible\nqualities when we are not perceiving them. Another is, in brief, we\nbelieve there are beings like ourselves who have the power of thought\nand feeling, and we perceive that one external object can affect many\nsuch beings; (EPEU [2020: 76\u201381]). She also constructs an\nargument intended to show that we can form an abstract general idea of\nexistence, or the notion of \u201cindefinite unknown existence\u201d\nwhich enables us to have thoughts of continued, external, and entirely\nindependent existence (EPEU [2020: 82\u201326]).\n",
