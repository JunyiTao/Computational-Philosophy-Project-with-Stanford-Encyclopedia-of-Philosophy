    "main_text": "Ancient and Hellenistic Sources\n1. Ancient and Hellenistic Sources\n\nThere were many varieties of skepticism extant during the Ancient and\nHellenistic periods, but two were particularly important to the later\nhistory of topic: Pyrrhonian Skepticism, especially as presented by\nSextus Empiricus, and the Academic Skepticism of Cicero.\n\nPre-medieval adherents of both types of skepticism not only held\nparticular skeptical positions, but also participated in a skeptical\nway of life, taking their arguments and positions as part of an\noverarching ethical worldview. Skeptics took their radical views of\nknowledge as means to the end of reaching the state of tranquility. By\nusing common argumentative moves called tropes, skeptics sought to\nelevate themselves and others to a state of suspension of belief\n(epoch\u00ea). And once this was reached, they held,\none\u2019s worries about philosophical matters would dissolve in\ntranquility.\n\nBecause of these ethical excellences, skeptics held themselves up as\nwise men. The more radical Pyrrhonian Skeptics, who doubted the truth\nof all claims, quickly ran afoul of the following objection, which has\nbeen given in various forms throughout the history of philosophy: a\nthoroughgoing skeptic, it seems, cannot live his or her skepticism. If\none doubts (and thus fails to act) on the truth of such claims as\n\u201cFood is necessary for human life\u201d, it would follow that\none could not live at all. Academic Skeptics attempted to avoid this\nobjection by arguing that though skepticism precluded living by the\ntruth, since the truth could not be known, nevertheless one could live\nby the truthlike or plausible. Hence theirs was a more practical\nversion of skepticism.\n",
