    "main_text": "Life and Relations to Predecessors || Relation to predecessors and contemporaries\n1.2 Relation to predecessors and contemporaries\n\nBoethius is a very independent thinker, and self-consciously so.\nExcept for one unclear reference to Albert the Great, Boethius never\nnames contemporaries or close predecessors, and so far only one source\nof influence has been identified with certainty: Albert the Great.\nHowever, Albert\u2019s influence is only noticeable in the questions\non Meteorology IV (see Fioravanti 1979), and only regards\nmatters of little philosophical importance. Some passages in the\nremaining \u0153uvre may indicate influence from Thomas Aquinas\n(Summa contra gentiles, Summa theologiae), but there is no\nscholarly consensus on this issue.\n\nIn much of modern historiography Boethius has been labelled\n\u201cAverroist\u201d or \u201cradical\u201d or \u201cheterodox\nAristotelian\u201d, and has shared those labels with Siger of\nBrabant. The \u201cAverroist\u201d label has little to recommend it.\nLike all his contemporaries, Boethius respected and used Averroes, but\nhe did not accord him any special status among authoritative authors\n(cf. Bianchi 2017). In particular, there is no sign that he defended\nthe doctrine of a pan-human material intellect that was considered\nAverroes\u2019 signature theory, and in his treatise on dreams he\nparts company with all known near-contemporaries by totally neglecting\nAverroes\u2019 optimistic views about the prognostic value of dreams.\nThe epithet \u201cheterodox\u201d or \u201cradical\nAristotelian\u201d comes with the tacitly understood counterpart\n\u201corthodox and moderate like Aquinas\u201d, and thus only makes\nsense from a certain religious point of view. Boethius was very much\nan Aristotelian, but, as was normal at the time, his Aristotelianism\ncontained elements originating in Avicenna and the neo-Platonic\nLiber de causis. Siger and Boethius were contemporaries and\ntaught the same authoritative books, so they inevitably shared some\nstandard assumptions and topics of discussion, but philosophically\nthey were not particularly close to each other.\n",
