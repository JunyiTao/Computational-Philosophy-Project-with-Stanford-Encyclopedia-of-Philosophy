According to\nJon Elster\u2019s classic description of adaptive preference\nformation, a fox, after finding that he can no longer reach some\ngrapes, decides that he does not want the grapes after all. The fox\nadapts his preferences to what he perceives to be the options\navailable to him. In order to distinguish adaptive preference\nformation from preference change due to learning and other processes,\nElster proposes that the former is an unconscious process in which an\nagent turns away from a preference to avoid unpleasant cognitive\ndissonance that is associated with holding on to it. According to\nElster, this is a \u201cblind psychic process operating \u2018behind\nthe back\u2019 of the person\u201d (Elster 1983, 16; see also\nColburn 2011). Others characterize adaptive preferences as those the\nagent finds herself with after \u201clife-long habituation\u201d\n(Nussbaum 2001, 80; Sen 1995; see also Khader 2009, 2011). For\nexample, Martha Nussbaum describes the case of poor working women in\nIndia who, though subjected to physical abuse by their husbands,\nchoose to remain in the marriage. Some women, like Vasanti, think that\nthe abuse \u201cwas painful and bad, but, still, a part of\nwomen\u2019s lot in life, just something women have to put up with as\npart of being a woman dependent on men, and entailed by having left\nher own family to move into a husband\u2019s home\u201d (Nussbaum\n2001, 68\u20139).\n\nIt is increasingly noticed that adaptive preferences are formed in the\ncircumstances of oppression. Theorists of oppression have pointed to\nthe phenomenon of \u201cdeformed desire\u201d in which \u201cthe\noppressed come to desire that which is oppressive to them\u2026[and]\none\u2019s desires turn away from goods and even needs that, absent\nthose conditions, they would want\u201d (Cudd 2006, 181). Adaptive or\ndeformed desires may be the result of the internalization of an\noppressive ideology:\n\nConsider the eighteen year-old college student who excels in her\nstudies, is well-liked by her many friends and acquaintances, leads an\nactive, challenging life, yet who regularly feels bad about herself\nbecause she does not have \u2018the right look\u2019\u2026 So, on\ntop of everything else she does, she expends a great deal of time and\nmoney trying to straighten or curl her hair, to refine her cosmetic\ntechnique, to harden or soften her body, and so on\u2026. (Benson\n1991, 389)\n\n\nOne plausible analysis of the student\u2019s psychology is that she\nhas internalized the oppressive norms of the fashion industry,\naccording to which appearance is tied to self-worth. The student has\nunconsciously turned away from values that would afford her a\nhealthier sense of self-worth; her desire for an excessive number of\nbeauty treatments is deformed because it is the product of adopting\nvalues that are oppressive to her, and it is a desire that she would\nnot have had absent the oppressive conditions.\n\nAdaptive or deformed preferences have been taken to be\n\u201cparadigmatically nonautonomous\u201d (Taylor 2009, 71). For\ninstance, feminists working on rational choice theory tend to assume\nthat deformed desires are incompatible with rational choice and\nautonomous choice, or at least that they arise only in contexts in\nwhich autonomy is already damaged (e.g., Superson 2005, 109). However,\nreactions to adaptive preferences vary in the literature on autonomy\n(Stoljar 2014; Terlazzo 2016). Marilyn Friedman suggests that women\nwho choose to remain in abusive relationships may be autonomous. For\nFriedman, adapting to an abusive relationship is in principle\ncompatible with the critical reflection that is sufficient for\nautonomy; such women may have endorsed the preference to remain and\nmay have rejected competing options (Friedman 2003, 146).\n(Friedman\u2019s \u201cprocedural\u201d account of autonomy will be\ndiscussed in detail in \u00a74.) Other autonomy theorists argue along\nsimilar lines, leaving open the possibility that adaptive preferences\ncould count as autonomous. Andrea Westlund argues that women could\n\u201cfreely and authentically\u201d be committed to norms that\nsubordinate them, as long as they are answerable to others for their\ncommitment to these norms (e.g., Westlund 2009, 29; see \u00a77 of the\ncurrent entry).\n",
