    "main_text": "Formalism, reductionism and instrumentalism\n3. Formalism, reductionism and instrumentalism\n\nWeyl (1925)\n was a conciliatory reaction to Hilbert\u2019s proposal in\n 1922b\n and\n 1923,\n which nevertheless contained some important criticisms. Weyl\ndescribed Hilbert\u2019s project as replacing contentual mathematics\nby a meaningless game of formulas. He noted that Hilbert wanted to\n\u201csecure not truth, but the consistency of\nanalysis\u201d and suggested a criticism that echoes an earlier one\nby Frege: Why should we take consistency of a formal system of\nmathematics as a reason to believe in the truth of the pre-formal\nmathematics it codifies? Is Hilbert\u2019s meaningless inventory of\nformulas not just \u201cthe bloodless ghost of analysis\u201d? Weyl\nsuggested a solution:\n\n[I]f mathematics is to remain a serious cultural concern, then some\nsense must be attached to Hilbert\u2019s game of formulae,\nand I see only one possibility of attributing it (including its\ntransfinite components) an independent intellectual meaning. In\ntheoretical physics we have before us the great example of a [kind of]\nknowledge of completely different character than the common or\nphenomenal knowledge that expresses purely what is given in intuition.\nWhile in this case every judgment has its own sense that is completely\nrealizable within intuition, this is by no means the case for the\nstatements of theoretical physics. In that case it is rather the\nsystem as a whole that is in question if confronted with\nexperience.\n (Weyl, 1925,\n 140)\n\n\nThe analogy with physics is striking, and one can find similar ideas\nin Hilbert\u2019s own writing\u2014perhaps Hilbert was influenced in\nthis by Weyl. Although Hilbert\u2019s first proposals focused\nexclusively on consistency, there is a noticeable development in\nHilbert\u2019s thinking in the direction of a general reductivist\nproject of a sort quite common in the philosophy of science at the\ntime (as was pointed out by\n Giaquinto 1983).\n In the second half of the 1920s, Hilbert replaced the consistency\nprogram with a conservativity program: Formalized mathematics was to\nbe considered by analogy with theoretical physics. The ultimate\njustification for the theoretical part lies in its conservativity over\n\u201creal\u201d mathematics: whenever theoretical,\n\u201cideal\u201d mathematics proves a \u201creal\u201d\nproposition, that proposition is also intuitively true. This justifies\nthe use of transfinite mathematics: it is not only internally\nconsistent, but it proves only true intuitive propositions (and indeed\nall, since a formalization of intuitive mathematics is part of the\nformalization of all mathematics).\n\nIn\n 1926,\n Hilbert introduced a distinction between real and ideal formulas.\nThis distinction was not present in\n 1922b\n and only hinted at in\n 1923.\n In the latter, Hilbert presents first a formal system of\nquantifier-free number theory about which he says that \u201cThe\nprovable formulae we acquire in this way all have the character of the\nfinite\u201d (1139). Then the transfinite axioms (i.e., quantifiers)\nare added to simplify and complete the theory (1144). Here he draws\nthe analogy with the method of ideal elements for the first time:\n\u201cIn my proof theory, the transfinite axioms and formulae are\nadjoined to the finite axioms, just as in the theory of complex\nvariables the imaginary elements are adjoined to the real, and just as\nin geometry the ideal constructions are adjoined to the actual\u201d\n(ibid). When Hilbert, in\n 1926\n explicitly introduces the notion of an ideal proposition, and in\n 1928,\n when he first speaks of real propositions in addition to the\nideal, he is quite clear that the real part of the theory consists\nonly of decidable, variable-free formulas. They are supposed to be\n\u201cdirectly capable of verification\u201d\u2014akin to\npropositions derived from laws of nature which can be checked by\nexperiment\n (1928,\n 475). The new picture of the program was this: Classical mathematics\nis to be formalized in a system which includes formalizations of all\nthe directly verifiable (by calculation) propositions of contentual\nfinite number theory. The consistency proof should show that all real\npropositions which can be proved by ideal methods are true, i.e., can\nbe directly verified by finite calculation. (Actual proofs such as the\n\\(\\varepsilon\\)-substitution had always been of such a kind: provide\nfinitary procedures which eliminate transfinite elements from proofs\nof real statements, in particular, of \\(0 = 1\\).) Indeed, Hilbert saw\nthat something stronger is true: not only does a consistency proof\nestablish truth of real formulas provable by ideal methods, but it\nyields finitary proofs of finitary general propositions if the\ncorresponding free-variable formula is derivable by ideal methods\n (1928,\n 474).\n\nHilbert suggested further restrictions on the theory in addition to\nconservativity: simplicity, brevity of proofs, \u201ceconomy of\nthought\u201d and mathematical productivity. The formal system of\ntransfinite logic is not arbitrary: \u201cThis formula game is\ncarried out according to certain definite rules, in which the\ntechnique of our thinking is expressed. [\u2026] The\nfundamental idea of my proof theory is none other than to describe the\nactivity of our understanding, to make a protocol of the rules\naccording to which our thinking actually proceeds\u201d\n (Hilbert 1928,\n 475). When\n Weyl (1928)\n eventually turned away from intuitionism, he emphasized this\nmotivation of Hilbert\u2019s proof theory: not to turn mathematics\ninto a meaningless game of symbols, but to turn it into a theoretical\nscience which codifies scientific (mathematical) practice (see\n Mancosu and Ryckman 2002\n and\n Kish Bar-On 2021\n on Weyl\u2019s relationship to intuitionism and Hilbert\u2019s\nformalism).\n\nHilbert\u2019s formalism was thus quite sophisticated: It avoided two\ncrucial objections: (1) If the formulas of the system are meaningless,\nhow can derivability in the system generate any kind of belief? (2)\nWhy accept the system of \\(\\PA\\) and not any other consistent system?\nBoth objections are familiar from Frege; both questions are (in part)\nanswered by a conservativity proof for real statements. For (2),\nfurthermore, Hilbert has a naturalistic criterion of acceptance: we\nare constrained in the choice of systems by considerations of\nsimplicity, fecundity, uniformity, and by what mathematicians actually\ndo; Weyl would add that the ultimate test of a theory would be its\nusefulness in physics.\n\nMost philosophers of mathematics writing on Hilbert have read him as\nan instrumentalist (including\n Kitcher 1976,\n Resnik 1980,\n Giaquinto 1983,\n Sieg 1990, and in particular\n Detlefsen 1986)\n in that they read Hilbert\u2019s explanation that the ideal\npropositions \u201chave no meaning in themselves\u201d\n (Hilbert, 1926,\n 381) as claiming that classical mathematics is a mere\ninstrument, and that statements of transfinite mathematics have no\ntruth value. To the extent that this is accurate, it must be\nunderstood as a methodological instrumentalism: A successful execution\nof the proof-theoretic program would show that one could pretend\nas if mathematics was meaningless. The analogy with physics\nis therefore not: transfinite propositions have no meaning just as\npropositions involving theoretical terms have no meaning, but:\ntransfinite propositions require no direct intuitive meaning just as\none does not have to directly see electrons in order to theorize about\nthem.\n Hallett (1990),\n taking into account the 19th century mathematical background from\nwhich Hilbert came as well as published and unpublished sources from\nHilbert\u2019s entire career (in particular\n Hilbert 1992,\n the most extensive discussion of the method of ideal elements) comes\nto the following conclusion:\n\n[Hilbert\u2019s treatment of philosophical questions] is not\nmeant as a kind of instrumentalist agnosticism about existence and\ntruth and so forth. On the contrary, it is meant to provide a\nnon-skeptical and positive solution to such problems, a solution\ncouched in cognitively accessible terms. And, it appears, the same\nsolution holds for both mathematical and physical theories. Once new\nconcepts or \u201cideal elements\u201d or new theoretical terms have\nbeen accepted, then they exist in the sense in which any\ntheoretical entities exist.\n (Hallett, 1990,\n 239)\n\n",
