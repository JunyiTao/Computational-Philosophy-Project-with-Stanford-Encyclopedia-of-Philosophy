Three lines of tradition: friends, foes, and critical friends\n\nIn Western thought systematic inquiry into the character and the value\nof markets started in the early modern period. Earlier analyses were\ntypically restricted to questions about the economic relations of the\nhousehold, the \u201coikos\u201d (which is the root of the term\n\u201ceconomics\u201d). Important exceptions are Aristotle\u2019s\ndiscussion of the character of money (Politics I, 8\u201310)\nand the discussions in which this topic was taken up. They raise\nfundamental questions about legitimate and illegitimate forms of\nexchange. From at least the 18th century onwards, one finds intense\ndebates about the nature of markets and their value for individuals\nand societies (on the history of economic thought see for example the\nclassic, but somewhat outdated, Schumpeter (1954) or for a more\ntechnical account Blaug (1996)).\n\nThe line of thinkers who by and large endorse markets reaches from\nMandeville\u2019s Fable of the Bees (1924 [1714/1721]) to\nthe Scottish Enlightenment, with Adam Smith\u2019s 1776 Inquiry\ninto the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations often seen as\nthe birth certificate of economics as a separate science. In the 19th\ncentury, insights from Smith and other earlier thinkers were taken up\nby \u201cclassic\u201d economists such as Thomas Malthus [1798] or\nDavid Ricardo [1817]. In the 20th century the pro-market tradition\nincludes the \u201cAustrian\u201d school with thinkers such as\nLudwig von Mises (e.g., 1949), Joseph Schumpeter (e.g., 1942), and\nF.A. von Hayek (e.g., 1944; 1973\u20139); James Buchanan and the\n\u201cVirginia School\u201d with its focus on public choice theory\n(e.g., Buchanan 1975); and the (largely libertarian) \u201cChicago\nSchool\u201d with Milton Friedman as its most prominent\nrepresentative (e.g., 1962; on the Chicago School as a whole see e.g.,\nEmmett (2010); for a critical delineation of libertarian from liberal\nthought see Freeman 2001). The arguments by friends of markets have\nchanged over time, but there are some threads that unite this\ntradition: the emphasis on individualism and on markets as helping to\nemancipate individuals from traditional ties, a \u201cnegative\u201d\nunderstanding of freedom, a focus on the innovating and modernizing\neffects of markets, and on their positive impact on the welfare of\nsociety.\n\nThere is also a long tradition of thinkers critical of markets. This\nwas, in a sense, the \u201cdefault\u201d position in the Christian\nculture of the European middle ages, where trade and markets were seen\nas driven by, and favorable to, the sins of gluttony and greed, and as\ninimical to the established\n order.[2]\n In the last three centuries, the most important critics of markets\ninclude Jean-Jacques Rousseau (notably in the Second Discourse on\nthe Origins of Inequality [1764] (1997)), and Karl Marx and\nFriedrich Engels (e.g., Communist Manifesto,\nCapital) and the Marxist tradition, which has unfolded into a\nwide spectrum of positions, from left-wing social democrats to radical\ncommunists (see Ko\u0142akowski 1978). Common themes in this tradition\nare the inegalitarian, disruptive results of unregulated markets,\ntheir instability, their alienating effects (e.g., separating\nindividuals from the fruits of their labor, see also\n section 3.2\n below), and their degrading effects on the poor. What also unites\nthese thinkers is the hope that there are alternatives to markets for\norganizing the economic life of large-scale societies. In the 19th\ncentury and the first three quarters of the 20th century what was\nstandardly quoted as an alternative to a market economy was a\ncentrally planned economy. After the fall of communism in Eastern\nEurope and Russia other, usually more modest, models have been\ndiscussed and sometimes experimented with (for examples see e.g.,\nWright 2011, ch. 7). Much of the force of criticisms of markets\ndepends on the availability of alternative models that score better on\na number of normative dimensions. Research on and experiments with\nalternative models are therefore of great interest for philosophers\nwho wish to evaluate markets from a normative perspective.\n\nThere is a third line of thinkers who stand between the friends and\nthe foes of markets and argue for a qualified endorsement: they see\nadvantages in markets, but also problems. Therefore, they either argue\nthat the overall balance is positive, or that the problems can be\nmitigated by other institutions. Often, this position is motivated by\nthe argument that we do not know of a better way of organizing the\neconomic life of large societies, and that it is therefore better,\noverall, to \u201ctame\u201d markets than to abolish them. This\nposition has been held by thinkers as diverse as G.W.F. Hegel (1942\n[1821]), J.S. Mill (1848), J.M. Keynes (1936) or John Rawls (1971) and\nby many social-democratic parties in Europe (see Berman 2006). What\nunites them is a belief in the \u201cprimacy of politics.\u201d\nMarkets are welcomed as an instrument for achieving certain aims\nwithin the framework of the state, but their purpose, extent,\nand limits should be determined by politics. Whether and how this\nprimacy of politics is possible is another important question in the\nphilosophical debate about markets (cf. also 4.3 below).\n\nToday, remnants of these historical traditions can be found in the\nways in which different academic disciplines look at markets. Although\nthere are exceptions, economists typically see markets in a positive\nlight. They have long analyzed them using abstract methods that model\nindividuals as sovereign, rational choosers. This approach, which\nleaves a number of problems of real-life markets unexplained, has also\nbeen used for incentive-based analyses of other social spheres (see\nnotably Gary Becker, e.g., 1976). These have raised questions about\nthe possibilities and limits of the rational choice approach,\nespecially since behavioral economists have started to explore how\nreal human behavior departs from the behavior assumed in the models\n(see e.g., Kahneman/Tversky 1979; Laibson 1997; Fehr/Schmidt 1999; for\nan overview of behavioral economics see e.g.,\nCamerer/Loewenstein/Rabin 2003; for a critique of rational choice\ntheory from a philosophical perspective see e.g., Sen 1977).\nSociologists, anthropologists, and historians use different, usually\nless abstract methods for exploring different markets. Their emphasis\nhas often been on the relation of markets to other spheres of life,\nbecause they see individuals as socially embedded, and their decisions\nas shaped by their social environment. Many researchers from these\ndisciplines are rather critical of capitalist markets. Their methods\nallow them to see problems to which economists may be methodologically\nblind. But economists might reply that the methods used by historians,\nsociologists and anthropologists are in turn less suitable for\ngrasping the positive indirect effects of markets, for\nexample the benefits for customers when a company is restructured.\nAlthough they can be intertwined, it is therefore important to\ndistinguish between disciplinary approaches, research methods, and\nsubstantive arguments about the value of markets.\n",
