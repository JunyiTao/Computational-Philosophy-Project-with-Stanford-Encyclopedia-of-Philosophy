    "main_text": "The Second Incompleteness Theorem || Preliminaries\n3.1 Preliminaries\n\nInformally, the reasoning leading to the second incompleteness theorem\nis relatively simple. Given the arithmetized provability predicate, it\nis also easy to present an arithmetized consistency statement: pick\nsome manifestly inconsistent formula (in arithmetical theories, a\nstandard choice is \\((\\underline{0} = \\underline{1})\\)); let\nus denote it by \\(\\bot\\); (the arithmetized counterpart of) the\nconsistency of the system can then be defined as\n\\(\\neg\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner \\bot \\urcorner)\\).\nLet us abbreviate this formula by \\(\\Cons(F)\\). The proof of\nthe first part of the first incompleteness theorem (i.e., the case (i)\nabove) can then presumably be formalized inside \\(F\\) (in practice\nthis would certainly be intricate). This gives:\n\n\\[\nF \\vdash \\Cons(F) \\rightarrow G_F,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(G_F\\) is the G\u00f6del sentence for\n\\(F\\) provided by the first theorem. If \\(\\Cons(F)\\) were\nprovable in \\(F\\), so would be \\(G_F\\), by\nsimple logic. This would contradict G\u00f6del\u2019s first theorem.\nConsequently, \\(\\Cons(F)\\) cannot be provable in \\(F\\)\neither.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem\n\nAssume \\(F\\) is a consistent formalized system which contains\nelementary arithmetic. Then \\(F \\not\\vdash\\Cons(F)\\).\n\n\nThere is a question of philosophical importance that should be\nmentioned here: As it stands, G\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness\ntheorem only establishes the unprovability of one sentence,\n\\(\\Cons(F)\\). But does this sentence really express that\n\\(F\\) is consistent? (Compare this with the remark above that\n\\(G_F\\) does not, strictly speaking, express its\nown unprovability.) Furthermore, might there not be other\nsentences which are provable and also express the consistency of\n\\(F\\)?\n\nGiving a rigorous proof of the second theorem in a more general form\nthat covers all such sentences, however, has turned out to be very\ncomplicated. The basic reason for this is that, unlike in the first\ntheorem, not just any, merely extensionally adequate provability\npredicate works for the formalization of the consistency claim. The\nmanner of presentation makes all the difference. For example,\nRosser\u2019s provability predicate mentioned above would not do; one\ncan prove the \u201cconsistency\u201d of \\(F\\) in \\(F\\), if\nconsistency is expressed in terms of Rosser\u2019s provability\npredicate. One must thus add some further conditions for the\nprovability predicate in order for the proof of the second\nincompleteness theorem to go through. Following Feferman (1960), it is\ncustomary to say that whereas the first theorem and its relatives are\nextensional results, the second theorem is intensional:\nit must be possible to think that \\(\\Cons(F)\\) in some sense\nexpresses the consistency of \\(F\\)\u2014that it really\nmeans that \\(F\\) is consistent.\n",
