    "main_text": "Diagrams and Cognition, Applications || Diagrams as Mental Representations\n5.3 The Cognitive Role of Diagrams\n\nWithout being heavily involved in the imagery debate, some researchers\nhave focused on a distinct role that diagrams or pictures\u2014as\nopposed to traditional sentential forms\u2014play in our cognitive\nactivities. (Shin\n 2015;\n Hamami & J. Mumma\n 2013)\n Based on the conjectures that humans adopt diagrammatic or spatial\ninternal mental representations in their reasoning about concrete or\nabstract situations (see Howell\n 1976;\n Sober\n 1976),\n some cognitive scientists have concentrated on the functions of\nimages or diagrams in our various cognitive activities, for example,\nmemory, imagination, perception, navigation, inference,\nproblem-solving, and so on. Here, the distinct nature of \u201cvisual\ninformation,\u201d which is obtained either through internal mental\nimages or through externally drawn diagrams, has become a major topic\nof research. Even though most of these works assume that there are\nmental images (that is, they accept the pictorialists\u2019 claim),\nstrictly speaking they do not have to commit themselves to the view\nthat these images exist as basic units in our cognition.\nDescriptionalists do not have to discard discussions of the functions\nof images, but only need to add that these images are not primitive\nunits stored in our memory, but formed out of structured descriptions\nmore like the sentences of a language (see Pylyshyn\n 1981).\n\nA search for the distinct role of diagrams has led researchers to\nexplore the differences among different forms of external or internal\nrepresentations, and mainly between diagrammatic and sentential\nrepresentations. Many important results have been produced in\ncognitive science. Starting from Larkin and Simon\u2019s classic case\nstudy\n (1987)\n to illustrate a difference between informational and computational\nequivalence among representation systems, Lindsay\u2019s work locates\nwhere this computational difference lies, which he calls a\n\u2018non-deductive\u2019 method. As briefly pointed out above, this\ninference process is called \u2018free ride\u2019 by Barwise and\nShimojiima\n (1995),\n i.e., the kind of an inference in which the conclusion seems to be\nread off automatically from the representation of premises. In Gurr,\nLee, and Stenning\n (1998)\n and Stenning and Lemon\n (2001),\n there is an explanation of the uniqueness of diagrammatic inference\nin terms of a degree of \u2018directness\u2019 of interpretation,\nand it is argued that this property is relative, and hence that\n\u201csome rides are cheaper than others\u201d. Having the role of\ngraphs in mind, Wang and Lee\n (1993)\n present a formal framework as a guideline for correct visual\nlanguages. At this point, we are very close to applied aspects of\nresearch in multi-modal reasoning\u2014design theory and AI\nresearch\u2014by providing these disciplines with computational\nsupport for visual reasoning.\n\nRelated to the issue of imagistic mental representation is the\nexamination of the semantics of various diagrammatic systems and what\nthey can teach us about the nature of languages in general (e.g.,\nGoodman\n 1968).\n For instance, Robert Cummins\n (1996),\n amongst others, argues that too little attention has been given to\ndiagrammatic representations and that focus on a notion of\n\u201cstructural representation\u201d more akin to diagrammatic\nrepresentation can help to explicate the nature of representation\nitself. We believe that the considerations presented above give us\nsome empirical handle on this type of claim at least\u2014depending\non the imagistic objects and relations used, patterns of incorrect\ninference should be predictable and detectable. An important, if\nlittle-known, article on this theme is Malinas\n 1991.\n Here Malinas explores the concepts of pictorial representation and\n\u201ctruth in\u201d a picture via the notion of resemblance, and\nconsiders various semantic puzzles about pictorial representation. He\ndevelops Peacocke\u2019s \u201cCentral Thesis\u201d of depiction\n(Peacocke\n 1987),\n where experienced similarities between properties of pictorial\nobjects and their referents in the visual field give rise to the\nrelation of depiction. He goes on to provide a formal semantics for\npictures which is \u201canalogous to a semantics for an ideal\nlanguage\u201d.\nSummary\n\nWe began by motivating the philosophical interest of diagrams, by way\nof their role in human reasoning and their relation to the study of\nlanguage in general, and multi-modal information processing. We then\nexplained the trade-off between expressive power and visual clarity of\ndiagrammatic systems, by examining the historical development of\ndiagram systems from Euler and Venn, through Peirce\u2019s work, to\nrecent work by Shin and Hammer. It was argued that diagrammatic\nsystems can be afforded the same logical status as traditional linear\nproof calculi. We then explained some of the potential pitfalls of\ndiagrammatic representation and reasoning, by examining spatial\nconstraints on diagrammatic systems and how they can affect\ncorrectness and expressive power. We closed by surveying other\ndiagrams systems, the interest in diagrams generated in computer\nscience and cognitive science, and gave an introduction to the imagery\ndebate in the philosophy of mind. \n",
