    "main_text": "From Production to Consumption || Against Bridging the Gap\n4.2 Against Bridging the Gap\n\nDriver, Lawford-Smith, McPherson, and James Rachels argue that it is wrong to\nconsume wrongfully produced food and try to explain why this is. The\nproductivist, extractivist, participatory, and attitudinal ideas, too,\ntry to explain it. But it could be that there is nothing to\nexplain.\n\nIt could be that certain modes of production are wrong yet consuming\ntheir products is permissible. We might assume that if\nconsumption of certain goods is wrong, then that wrongness would have\nto be partly explained in terms of the wrongness of those goods\u2019\nproduction and then argue that there are no sound routes from a\nrequirement not to produce a food to a requirement not to consume it\n(Frey 1983). This leaves open the possibility that consumers might be\nrequired to do something\u2014for example, work for\npolitical changes that end the wrongful system\u2014but permitted to\neat wrongfully-produced food.\n\nAs \u00a74.1 discusses, Warfield raises a problem for productivist\naccounts that they seem to falsely imply that morally permissible\nactivities like paying rent to meat-eaters or buying salad at a\nrestaurant serving meat are morally wrong (2015). Add the assumption\nthat if consumption is wrong, it is wrong because some\nproductivist view is true, and it follows that consumption of wrongful\ngoods need not be wrongful. (Warfield does not assume this but instead\nsays that \u201cthe best discussion\u201d of the connection between\nproduction and consumption is \u201cbroadly consequentialist\u201d\n(ibid., 154).)\n\nInstead, we might assume that an extractivist or participatory or\nattitudinal view is correct if any is and then argue no such view is\ncorrect. We might, for example, argue that these anti-consumption\nviews threaten to forbid too much. If the wrongness of producing and\nwrongness of consuming are connected, what else is connected?\nIf buying meat is wrong because it exhibits the wrong attitude towards\nanimals, is it permissible to be friends with people who buy that\nmeat\u2014or does this, too, evince the wrong attitudes towards\nanimals? If killing animals for food is wrong, is it permissible\nmerely to abstain from consuming them or must one do more work to stop\ntheir killing? The implications of various arguments against consuming\nanimals and animal products might be far-reaching. Some will see this\nas an acknowledgment that something is wrong with moral vegetarian\narguments. As Gruen and Jones (2015) note, the lifestyle some such\narguments point to might not be enactable by creatures like us. Yet\nthey see this not as grounds for rejection of the argument but,\nrather, as acknowledgment that the argument sets out an aspiration\nthat we can orient ourselves towards (cf. \u00a74 of Curtin 1991 on\n\u201ccontextual vegetarianism\u201d).\n\nA different sort of argument in favor of the all things considered\npermissibility of consuming meat comes from the idea that eating and\nbuying animals actually makes for a great cultural good (Lomasky\n2013). Even if we accept that the production of those animals is\nwrong, it could be that the great good of consuming justifies doing\nso. (Relatedly, it could be that the bad of refusing to\nconsume justifies consumption as in a case in which a host has labored\nover barbequed chicken for hours and your refusing to eat it would\ndevastate him.) Yet this seems to leave open the possibility that all\nsorts of awful practices might be permissible because they are\nessential parts of great cultural goods. It threatens to permit too\nmuch.\n",
