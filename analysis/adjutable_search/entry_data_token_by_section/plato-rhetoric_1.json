    "main_text": "Ion\n2. Ion\n\nIon is a prize-winning professional reciter of poetry\u2014a\n\u201crhapsode\u201d\u2014and of Homer in\n particular.[7]\n Though he speaks his lines with the requisite conviction and emotion,\nhe does not \u201cimitate\u201d his subjects in the sense of act\ntheir parts (of course, Homer did not write for the stage). He is a\nperformer but not a (stage) actor. Ion is depicted as superb at making\nthe Iliad and Odyssey come alive, at communicating\ntheir drama to his audience and at involving them intimately. We might\nsay that he \u201crepresents\u201d or \u201cexpresses\u201d the\ncharacters, action, and narrative of Homer\u2019s epic poems, and thus in\nsome sense both identifies with his subject and leads his audience to\ndo the same. As he puts it in the dialogue that bears his name: if he\nhas done his job well, he will find himself weeping when reciting\nsorrowful lines, and expects to see his audience weep along with him\n(535b1\u2013e6). Both are somehow transported, thanks to Ion\u2019s superb\nnarrative capacity, into the original scene (as Socrates says, Ion is\n\u201cbeside himself\u201d and in the enthusiasm of the moment\nthinks he is present at the scene he is describing; 535b7\u2013c3).\n\nBut Ion thinks himself capable of yet more, for he also claims to be\nan expert in explaining what Homer means. He\u2019s an exegete (see 531a7)\nor interpreter par excellence, and this claim especially intrigues\nSocrates. He does not permit Ion to actually exhibit his skills as a\nrhapsode, and instead insists that he engage in give-and-take about\nthe abilities Ion claims to possess. This is typical of Socrates\u2019\nmethod; he forces his interlocutor to give an account of his\ncommitments and way of life. As both reciter and exegete, the rhapsode\nhas no exact analogue today. Nonetheless, the implications of the\nIon are broad; while Ion is not a poet himself, he bears\nimportant traits in common with the poet.\n\nThe thrust of Socrates\u2019 initial questioning is revealing. Essentially,\nhe attempts to show that Ion is committed to several theses that are\nnot compatible with one another, unless a rather peculiar, saving\nassumption is introduced. Ion claims that he is a first rate\nexplicator of Homer; that he is a first rate explicator only\nof Homer, and loses interest as well as competence if another poet\n(such as Hesiod) is brought up (531a3\u20134, 532b8\u2013c2;\n533c4\u20138); and that Homer discusses his subjects much better than\ndo any other poets (531d4\u201311, 532a4\u20138). Ion may justly be\nthought of as one of the \u201cpraisers\u201d of Homer referred to\nin Republic X (see above, and Ion 542b4). Notice\nthat Socrates\u2019s first order of business is to get Ion to agree that a\nnumber of claims are being made by him; while this may seem\nobvious, it is an essential condition for Socrates\u2019 inquiry, and is a\ndistinctive characteristic of the sort of thing Socrates does as a\nphilosopher.\n\nIf Ion is an exegete or explicator of Homer\u2019s poems, he must surely\nunderstand what the poet means, else he could not explain the poet\u2019s\nthoughts. This seemingly commonsensical point is asserted by Socrates\nat the start (530c1\u20135), and happily accepted by Ion. However, if\nIon understands what the poet says about X, and judges that\nthe poet speaks best about X, he must be in a position to\nassess other poets\u2019 pronouncements about the subject in question. For\nexample, Homer talks a great deal about how war is waged; as an expert\non Homer who claims that Homer spoke beautifully about that subject\n(in the sense of got it right), Ion must be in a position to explain\njust how Homer got it right and how Hesiod, say, got it wrong, as a\nseries of simple analogies show. If you can knowledgeably\n(531e10) pick out a good speaker on a subject, you can also pick out\nthe bad speaker on it, since the precondition of doing the former is\nthat you have knowledge of the relevant subject matter. But this seems\nto contradict Ion\u2019s assertion that he can explain only Homer, not the\nother poets.\n\nLet us recapitulate, since the steps Socrates is taking are so\nimportant for his critique of poetry (it is noteworthy that at several\njunctures, Socrates generalizes his results from epic to dithyrambic,\nencomiastic, iambic, and lyric poetry; 533e5\u2013534a7,\n534b7\u2013c7). To interpret Homer well, we have to understand what\nHomer said; to do that, and to support our judgment that he spoke\nsuperlatively well, we have to understand the subject matter about\nwhich Homer speaks (just as we would in, say, evaluating someone\u2019s\npronouncements about health). Further, Homer himself must have\nunderstood well that about which he speaks. As interpreters or\nassessors, we are claiming to be experts judging a claim (in this case\nHomer\u2019s) to expertise, just as though we were members of a medical\nexamination board considering an application to the profession. So as\ninterpreters we are making claims about the truth of Homer\u2019s teachings\nabout XYZ; and thus we are assuming that Homer sought to\nstate the truth about XYZ. Given that he discusses the\ncentral topics of human and godly life (531c1\u2013d2), it would seem that\nHomer claims to be wise, and that as his devoted encomiasts we too\nmust be claiming to be wise (532d6\u2013e1). But claims to wisdom are\nsubject to counter-claims (the poets disagree with each other, as\nSocrates points out); and in order to adjudicate between them, as well\nas support our assessment of their relative merits, we must open\nourselves to informed discussion both technical and philosophical.\nTechnical, because on subjects such as (say) war-making, the general\nshould be consulted about the accuracy of Homer\u2019s description thereof;\nphilosophical because both the method of assessing the whole (the\n\u201cSocratic method\u201d) and the comprehensive claims about the\ntruth made by interpreter and poet, are properly philosophical\npreoccupations for Plato.\n\nIt is but a step from there to the proposition that neither Ion nor\nHomer can sustain their claims to knowledge, and therefore could not\nsustain the claim that the poems are fine and beautiful works. In\npassage after passage, Homer pronounces on subjects that are the\nprovince of a specialized techne (art or skill), that is, a\nspecialized branch of knowledge. But neither the rhapsode nor Homer\npossesses knowledge of all (or indeed perhaps any) of those\nspecialized branches (generalship, chariot making, medicine,\nnavigation, divination, agriculture, fishing, horsemanship, cow\nherding, cithara playing, wool working, etc.). Ion attempts to resist\nthis by claiming that thanks to his study of Homer, he knows what a\ngeneral (for example) should say (540d5). Since he has accepted that\nthis would involve possessing the art of generalship (541e2,\ntechne kai episteme), his claim is patently indefensible, and\nSocrates charges that he has failed to make good on his assertion to\nbe \u201cwonderfully wise \u2026 about Homer\u201d (542a1).\n\nSo Ion, and by extension Homer, are faced with a series of unpalatable\nalternatives:\n\nThey could continue to defend the claim that they really do know\nthe subjects about which they discourse\u2014in the sense of possess\nthe techne kai episteme of them, i.e., a mastery of the\nsubject matter. Yet if they do defend that claim they will be liable\nto examination by relevant experts.\nThey could admit that they do not know what they are talking\nabout. This admission could be understood in several ways:\n\n\n(b.1) one would amount to saying that while lacking in technical\nknowledge (knowledge of this or that craft or skill), they do have\nknowledge of human affairs\u2014something like knowledge of human\nnature, of how human life tends to go, of the relation between (say)\nvirtue and happiness, as well as of the natures of both virtue and\nhappiness. To this might be added the claim that the poets and their\nexponents know the nature of the cosmos and of the divine. In the\nRepublic Socrates in effect allows them comprehensive claims\nto knowledge along those lines, and then attacks across the board,\nseeking to show that the poets have got it wrong on all important\ncounts.\n\n(b.2) alternatively, they could admit that they do not have either\ntechnical or non-technical knowledge of any of the topics about which\nthey sing; rather, they possess the skill (techne) of\ncreating beautiful, persuasive, and moving images of the subjects in\nquestion. So when Ion claims that Homer speaks beautifully about X, he\njust means that Homer speaks beautifully in a rhetorical sense even\nthough he (Homer) does not necessarily know what he is talking about.\nBy extension, poets would (on this interpretation) make the same\nclaim about themselves. That would seem to reduce them to rhetoricians,\nwhich in effect is what Socrates argues in the Gorgias, with\nthe further proviso that rhetoric as popularly practiced is not even a\ntechne. Poetry-as-mere-rhetoric is not a promising credential\nfor authority either to educate all of Greece or to better one\u2019s\naudience; (b.2) is not a position that poets or their rhapsodes would,\npresumably, be eager to adopt.\n\n(b.3) Ion could admit that he knows nothing about the topics Homer\naddresses, withdrawing his claim to be a knowledgeable exegete, but\nmaintain that Homer himself knows what he\u2019s talking about. Ion would\nbe liable to the question as to how he knows all that,\nhowever; and in any case would at best shift Socrates\u2019 attack to the\nreal target, viz. Homer.\n\n(b.4) Socrates provides a seemingly more palatable alternative in the\nIon, one that is echoed in the Phaedrus (245a); this\nis the \u201cpeculiar, saving assumption\u201d mentioned above. It\nconsists in the thesis that Ion recites (and Homer composes) not from\nknowledge but from divine inspiration. Neither knows what he\nis saying, but is nonetheless capable of speaking or composing\nbeautifully thanks to the divine. They are like the worshippers of\nBacchus, out of their right minds (534b4\u20136). This creative\nmadness, as we might call it, they share with other Muse-inspired\nartists as well as prophets and diviners (534b7\u2013d1). This is supposed\nto explain why Ion can recite only Homer beautifully; he\u2019s been\ndivinely inspired only in that area, and that is all he means when he\nsays that Homer is better than his rival poets. Ion has no\nargument to support what looks like a comparative assessment;\nit is just a report to the effect that he is \u201cpossessed\u201d\nby Homer\u2019s magic thanks to the work of a god. A poet, further, is not\na knower, but a kind of transmitter of a divine spark; he or she is\n\u201can airy thing, winged and holy\u201d (534b3\u20134). The\nspark is generated by the god, and is passed down through the poet to\nthe rhapsode and then to the audience. In Socrates\u2019 unforgettable\nsimile, the relationship of the god to poet to rhapsode to audience is\nlike a magnetized sequence of rings, each of which sticks to the next\nthanks to the power of the divine magnet at the start\n(535e7\u2013536b4), as though they were links in a chain (as we might\nput it). \n\n\nThis simile helps to answer an important question: why should we care\nwhether or not the poets know what they are talking about, if we enjoy\ntheir compositions? Socrates\u2019 answer is that as the last link on this\nchain of inspiration, we are capable of being deeply affected by\npoetry. We \u201cspectators\u201d at the recital too lose our minds,\nto some degree, weeping or laughing as we enter into the narrated\nscene, seemingly forgetting our real selves and lives (535b2\u2013d9). In\nthe Ion he doesn\u2019t offer a further explanation of how this\neffect is supposed to happen\u2014for that, we will turn to the\nRepublic\u2014but the important point is that it does\nhappen. It would seem that the audience is transformed by the\nexperience in a way that momentarily takes them out of themselves.\nPerhaps it does not leave them as they were, for their understanding\nof what properly elicits their grief or their laughter would seem to\nbe shaped by this powerful experience, an experience they presumably\nrepeat many times throughout childhood and beyond. Perhaps they too\nstart to believe\u2014as Ion and possibly the poet do\u2014that they\n\u201cknow\u201d something thanks to their contact with the divine,\nsuch as how war is to be conducted and for what ends, what fidelity in\nlove means, or the character of the gods. None of this would matter\nmuch if superb poetry left us unmoved, or in any case as we were.\nPlato\u2019s critique depends on the assumption that poetry can and does\nshape the soul.\n\nThe \u201cdivine inspiration\u201d thesis resolves some problems for\nIon (and implicitly for Homer) while postponing others. One problem is\nindicated by the last few lines of the dialogue, where Socrates offers\nIon a choice: either be human, and take responsibility for unfairly\navoiding his questions about the nature of his (Ion\u2019s) wisdom; or\naccept the label \u201cdivine\u201d and subscribe to the inspiration\nthesis. Ion chooses the latter on grounds that it is\n\u201clovelier.\u201d It is an invitation to hybris, of course. How\neasy it would be to confuse divine and human madness (to borrow a\ndistinction from the Phaedrus 244a5\u2013245c4)! And not all\nof the contenders for the prize Ion has won could be equally worthy of\npromotion to divine status. By contrast, Socrates characterizes\nhimself in the Apology as not thinking he knows what he does\nnot know, as possessing human rather than divine\n \u201cwisdom.\u201d[8]\n Finally, since the poets and their rhapsodes both present views about\nhow things are and ought to be, and seek to persuade their auditors of\nthe same, they cannot escape responsibility for the implicit claim to\nwisdom and authority they make. For Plato, this means that they must\nbe held accountable. It is philosophy\u2019s mission to force them to give\nan account of themselves, and to examine its soundness. This would\nmean that they are required to engage philosophy on its turf, just as\nIon has somewhat reluctantly done. The legitimacy of that requirement\nis itself a point of contention, it is one aspect of the quarrel\nbetween philosophy and\n poetry.[9]\n",
