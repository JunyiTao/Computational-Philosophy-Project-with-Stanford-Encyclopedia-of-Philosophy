    "main_text": "Theories || Discussions and Contributions from the Semantic View\n4.3 Discussions and Contributions from the Semantic View\n\nThe distinctive feature of the semantic view is the centrality of\nmodels in the philosophical analysis of the concept of theory (Lloyd\n2006; Moulines 2008; P. Lorenzano 2013a). This does not rule out that\nmodels, in some of their many senses, play a role in other aspects of\nscience. It also does not deny that scientific theories, in some\nplausible sense of the concept, can be identified in different areas\nof science, including biology, and are relevant in many contexts, even\nif they do not constitute the totality of science or exhaust all\nphilosophically relevant things that can be said about science.\n\nAccording to the semantic view, concepts relative to models are much\nmore fruitful for the philosophical analysis of theories than concepts\nrelative to statements. The nature, structure, and function of\ntheories can be better understood when their metatheoretical\ncharacterization, analysis, or reconstruction is centered on the\nmodels they determine, rather than on a particular set of axioms,\nunderstood either as linguistic formulations or as propositions, or on\nother resources and devices through which they fulfill this function,\nsuch as diagrams or graphs. For this conception, the most fundamental\ncomponent for the identity of a theory is a class (set,\npopulation, collection, family) of models, which is not the\nsame as stating that a scientific theory should be identified with a\nclass of models. Some misrepresentations or sloppy presentations of\nthe semantic view do make this assertion. It is also not the same to\nsay that the class of models is the only one component of the\ntheory.\n\nIt is within the framework of the semantic conception that the largest\nnumber and most significant contributions made from Latin America to\nthe analysis of biological theories are to be found. One of the\nversions of the semantic view used is that of Patrick Suppes (1957),\nespecially how he identifies the class of models by the definition a\nset-theoretical predicate, shared by other variants of the semantic\nview, such as the partial structures approach (Da Costa & French\n1990) and the standard presentation of the structuralist view of\ntheories (Balzer, Moulines, & Sneed 1987). We find this in some\nworks by Brazilian biologist Nelson Papavero, who also worked in\nphilosophy and history of biology with the group led by Brazilian\nlogician and philosopher Newton da Costa, one of the founders of the\npartial structures approach. Papavero, together with Brazilian\nmathematician Jair Minoro Abe, combined some of the fundamentals of\nset theory with mathematical logic to create a classification system\nthat is isomorphic with phylogenetic systematics (Papavero & Abe\n1992). We also find a Suppesian analysis in the work of Brazilian\nbiologist and philosopher Jo\u00e3o Carlos Marques Magalh\u00e3es,\ntogether with his advisor D\u00e9cio Krause, a mathematician by\ntraining who later became a philosopher of physics advised by Newton\nda Costa. Magalh\u00e3es and Krause make use of axiomatization\n\u00e0 la Suppes in an attempt to identify the class of\nmodels of the theory of evolution by natural selection and of\npopulation genetics, extending the axiomatic treatment of the\nevolutionary theory presented by Mary Williams (1970) to encompass\naspects of genetics (Magalh\u00e3es & Krause 2001) and to deal\nwith the concept of Darwinian fitness so as to explore the\nrelationships between Darwinian theory and population genetics\n(Magalh\u00e3es & Krause 2006).\n\nHowever, it is the structuralist view of theories, or Sneedian or\nmetatheoretical structuralism, that has produced the largest number of\nanalyses of particular theories from the biological sciences in Latin\nAmerica, as well as from the biochemical and biomedical sciences.\nHowever, this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international\naudience, perhaps because most of the relevant works have been\npublished in Spanish or German, rather than in English.\n\nThese analyses have been carried out in Mexico, after C. Ulises\nMoulines\u2019s time there, mainly by biologist turned philosopher\nMario Casanueva, who obtained a doctorate in Barcelona under\nMoulines\u2019s direction, and by biologist and philosopher Diego\nM\u00e9ndez, first a student and then a colleague of Casanueva.\nOther relevant analyses have been done in Argentina, largely due to\nthe formative work of C\u00e9sar and Pablo Lorenzano and the\ncollaborative work they promote among philosophers Santiago Ginnobili,\nMercedes O\u2019Lery, and Federico Bernab\u00e9, biologists and\nphilosophers Luc\u00eda Federico, Daniel Blanco, and Mart\u00edn\nD\u00edaz, and biochemist and philosopher Karina Alleva, as well as\nto Ginnobili\u2019s later formative work with a younger generation of\nphilosophers such as Ariel Roff\u00e9 and Andrea Olmos, and the\nteamwork among all these scholars.\n\nAmong the theories analyzed, in the field of evolutionary biology we\ncan find the theory of evolution by natural selection (Ginnobili 2010,\n2016, 2018; D\u00edez & Lorenzano 2013; Ginnobili & Blanco\n2019), the theory of common descent (D. Blanco 2012), the theory of\nfunctions (Ginnobili 2011), and the niche construction theory\n(Casanueva & Madrigal 2021; M\u00e9ndez 2021); in the field of\nsystematics, cladistics (Roff\u00e9 2020); in the field of\ninheritance and genetics, theories of classical, molecular, and\npopulation genetics (Balzer & Lorenzano 2000; Casanueva 1997,\n2002, 2003; Casanueva & M\u00e9ndez 2005, 2012; P. Lorenzano\n1995, 2000, 2002, 2013b,c, 2014; and O\u2019Lery 2016); in the field\nof ecology, population dynamics theory (P. Lorenzano & D\u00edaz\n2020); in the field of cytology and histology, cellular and tissue\ntheories (As\u00faa & Klimovsky 1987, 1990); in the field of\nneurosciences and of neuroendocrinology, organizational-activational\ntheory (Bernab\u00e9 2019); in the field of biochemistry, enzyme and\nmetabolic theories (Donolo, Federico, & Lorenzano 2006, 2007,\n2016; Federico 2009; C. Lorenzano 2002, 2007), allosteric theory\n(Alleva, D\u00edez, & Federico 2017), and free-radical theory of\naging and the model of oxidation-reduction reactions (O\u2019Lery\n2012a, b); and in the field of biomedical sciences, physiology (C.\nLorenzano 2010), clinical medical theory (C. Lorenzano 2011), the\nhumoral theory of immunity (C. Lorenzano 2012), and the theory of the\ncircular motion of the blood (Barutta & Lorenzano 2012).\n\nIn all these theories, and in accordance with the methodology of\nmetatheoretical structuralism, all the main concepts that occur in\nthem are identified, distinguishing those that refer to empirical\nobjects from those that refer to mathematical objects. Concentrating\non concepts of the first kind, the descriptive ones, their formal\nstructure is pointed out, making explicit whether they are\nqualitative, comparative, or quantitative concepts, as is their\nlogical type, stating whether they represent sets, relations, or\nfunctions, whether numerical or not. Finally, the relations they have\nwith each other are specified, in the case that some of them should be\nconsidered to be basic or primitive and others could be considered to\nbe defined.\n\nIn addition, descriptive concepts are distinguished by the function\nthey fulfill within each theory. On the one hand, we have the concepts\nthat constitute the empirical, applicative, or testing part of the\ntheory and are used to identify and represent empirical systems. The\ntheory\u2019s users intend to account for \u201cportions of the\nworld\u201d conceived by means of this kind of descriptive concepts.\nThis specific domain of application of the theory depends strongly on\npragmatic and historical factors. On the other hand, we have the\nconcepts that constitute the \u201ctheoretical\u201d part of the\ntheory and are used to identify and represent the theoretical models,\nand how they relate to each other and to the concepts of the previous\nkind to say something about the world, i.e., to identify and represent\nthe \u201claws\u201d of the theory.\n\nAll the theories analyzed have been shown to have a strongly\nhierarchical structure, forming a kind of net or theory-net\nwith laws of very different degrees of generality, significance, and\nscope within the same conceptual setting. These theories or\ntheory-nets usually have a single fundamental law or guiding principle\nat the top of the hierarchy and a vast array of more special laws\nwhich apply to specific situations and not obtained by deduction but\nby specialization or specification.\n\nTwo remarks are pertinent here. The first is that since models are the\nsemantic or model-theoretic counterpart of laws, the above is\nequivalent to distinguishing different levels of generality between\nmodels of a single theory. The other is to realize the implications of\nacceptance of at least a minimal characterization of laws as\ncounterfactual-supporting regularities within the structuralist view,\nregardless of whether they are context-sensitive or domain-restricted.\nThere are also implications identifying \u201cfundamental\u201d laws\nfor the general philosophical problem of laws and the specific problem\nregarding about the existence of laws in biology. Here, we use\n\u201cfundamental\u201d in the sense of the scope and role played\nwithin the theories, and not in the sense of belonging to a supposed\n\u201cfundamental theory or science\u201d, even if some of them are\nimplicit. Furthermore, all these analyses of particular theories make\nit possible to deal with some of the philosophical issues arising in\nthe various biological subdisciplines to which they belong, some of\nwhich have been explicitly addressed in the analyses of the particular\ntheories referred to above or in relevant works that develop the\nimplications of such analyses for these issues.\n\nSome examples are the following. In relation to evolution, these\nissues include the structure of the theory, the nature and role of\ncertain concepts such as adaptation, fitness, and functional\nattributions; the scope of the theory, its refutability, and the\nnature of the principle of natural selection; and the unity of\nselection and its relation to population genetics. Regarding classical\nand population genetics and population dynamics, issues include the\nstatus of Mendel\u2019s laws, the Hardy-Weinberg law, and the\nLotka-Volterra model, within their respective theories. Relative to\ncladistics, we can identify the issue of their empirical character,\nand, in relation to neuroendocrinology, the discussion of\nandrocentrism, particularly in its form of neurosexism, pointing out\nwhere values play a role.\n",
