    "main_text": "The classical heritage\n5. The classical heritage\n\nLet us approach the first feature of the encyclopedia, that is, its\nreworking the of foreign \u201cscientific\u201d contents. Various\ncultural elements come together in the Epistles: Babylonian, Indian\nand Iranian astrology, Indian and Persian narrative, biblical\nquotations and cabbalistic influences, references to the New Testament\nand Christian gnosis. A good survey of these contents can be\nfound in Netton 1991, 53ff., 89ff. More recently, the scholar has\nemphasized as \"Philosophically, the Ras\u00e2\u2019il \n[...] constitute a marvelous epitome of the mixing of Aristotelianism\nand Neoplatonism in the caldron of Islamic intellectual endeavour\"\n(Netton 2009, 109). In spite of the commixtion of Aristotelian and\nNeoplatonic ideas \u2013 e.g., for identifying Aristotle's active\ncause with the faculties of the Universal Soul, \"Aristotle's\nterminology is all-pervasive in the\nRas\u00e2\u2019il\" (ibid., 111\u2013112). Most\nattention is paid to the Greeks, from the so-called\n\u201cpre-socratics\u201d to Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and the\nStoics. The encyclopedia can thus be considered a compendium\nof foreign sciences, deserving attention even by those who are only\ninterested to ascertain the extent of what the Arabs knew of ancient\ndoctrines at that time.\n\nComparisons between the Ikhw\u00e2n's quotations and the extant\nArabic versions of classical works often show that they might have\nused the same translations at our disposal now. When such comparisons\nare not possible, the ancient excerpta usually correspond to\nthe extant original texts. We should conclude, then, that in quoting,\nreporting \u2013 and, perhaps, translating \u2013 ancient sources\nthe Ikhw\u00e2n display the same philological and philosophical\nexpertise associated with the scholars to whom we owe the flourishing\nof the translation movement in Baghd\u00e2d. In some cases, they have\neven preserved the only Arabic fragments of Greek authors known to us,\nas exemplified by the well-known case of the story of Giges from\nPlato's Republic in Epistle 52. (The story of Giges is\nanalyzed in Baffioni 2001, 168\u2013170, 175\u2013178). Platonic\nreferences in the encyclopedia are also scarce. The majority of them\nare found in the fourth section and concern the trial and death of\nSocrates. There is also a hint at the doctrine of reminiscence, that\nis seldom mentioned in Muslim sources (cf. for the Ikhw\u00e2n\nal-Saf\u00e2\u2019 Epistle 42, III, 424, 15). The Ikhw\u00e2n are\nalso informed about the Platonic view on pleasures and about Plato's\nconception of the soul as consisting of three distinct parts: the\nrational soul, which resides in the head; the irascible soul, which\nresides in the heart and is the seat of courage; and the appetitive\nsoul, the seat of desire, which resides in the abdomen (III, 68,\n4\u20136). The Platonic references are religiously rather than\nphilosophically oriented. That can perhaps be explained by the\ninfluence of the Hellenistic curricula scientiarum (courses\nof study) designed for philosophers. These began by a reflection on\nthe Stoic bios theoretik\u00f2s (the philosophical attitude\ntowards life), continued with Aristotelian works representing the\n\u201cscientific\u201d side of knowledge, and ended with Platonic\nwritings, representing the \u201ctheological\u201d knowledge\n(D\u2019Ancona Costa 1996, 30\u201331). The religious approach to\nancient heritage leads the Ikhw\u00e2n to consider philosophy as an\n\u201cimitation of God according to human capacity.\u201d This\ndefinition immediately clarifies Hellenism as the authors' first\ntheoretical and historical reference. Their source is here Plato or,\nrather, his Hellenistic reading (Kraus 1986, 99, note 4).\n\nAlthough the Ikhw\u00e2n appear widely Aristotelian (for instance,\nfor their presentation of the terrestrial world or the theory of\nknowledge rooted in sensation), the wealth of the available sources\nled the \u201cPure Brethren\u201d to support their doctrines by a\nvariety of theoretical models, often melted together (which even\naffects the consistence of the Ikhwanian idea of God, Islamic and\nNeoplatonic at the same time, Netton 2009, 108).\n\nThe first topic addressed in the first section are the so-called\n\u201cquadrivium\u201d (a Latin term meaning \u201cthe four\nways\u201d) sciences (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music):\nEpistle 1 deals with arithmetic, Epistle 2 with geometry, Epistle 3\nwith astronomy and Epistle 5 with music. Arithmetic, geometry and\nmusic are later approached together in Epistle 6 On\nproportions. Between these two treatises another one is added,\nEpistle 4 On geography: \u2018ilm al-hay\u2019a\n(literally \u201ccosmography\u201d) was evidently considered part of\nastronomy \u2013 but Epistles 4 and 5 are copied in an inverted\norder in some MSS.\n\nReferences for the various sciences are, generally identifiable:\nEuclid, Nicomachus and sometimes even Archimedes for mathematical\ntenets (Epistles 1, 2 and 6); Ptolemy supports astronomy and geography\n(Epistles 3 and 4); the Pythagoreans and again Nicomachus are the\nsources for musical theory (Epistles 5 and 6). The Greeks already saw\narithmetic and geometry as the necessary, though not unique, means of\nattaining philosophical knowledge.\n\nMuch of this section is devoted to logic, the \u201cinstrument\u201d\nof sciences according to Aristotle and a view widely shared by Muslims\n(see Epistles 10\u201314). These treatises take the place of grammar,\nlogic and rhetoric, that in Middle Ages constituted the\n\u201ctrivium\u201d (in Latin: \u201cthe three ways\u201d)\nsciences and were the basis of a \u201cliberal arts\u201d education.\nThere is no place for poetry or for rhetorical devices in the\nencyclopedia. Dialectics increases damaging opposition among the\nlearned. Although the Ikhw\u00e2n appear interested in spoken\nlanguage and even in phonetics, they never approach grammar as a\nscience. Rather, they examine the technique of the\n\u201cuniversal\u201d form of language \u2013 logic. In the\nwell-known 10th century debate on the superiority of\ngrammar or of logic, they might have sided with the Christian logician\nAb\u00fb Bishr Matt\u00e2 ibn Y\u00fbnus more than with the\ngrammarian Ab\u00fb Sa\u2018\u00eed al-Siraf\u00ee (cf. Heck 2008,\n11 for a new perspective on this issue). \u201cTrivium\u201d was\nconsidered preparatory for the \u201cquadrivium,\u201d which was in\nturn considered preparatory for the study of philosophy and theology.\nThe \u201ctrivium\u201d and \u201cquadrivium\u201d sciences are\ndescribed in the encyclopedia in an original way as distinct from that\nof other Muslim writers as well as the Latin west (de Callata\u00ff\n2005, 61\u201362). Hellenistic influence is remarkable even when the\nIkhw\u00e2n rely on Aristotelian logic. The logical treatises include\nparaphrases of Porphiry's Isagoges, which the later Greeks\nconsidered to be the first book of Organon (Rhetoric\nand Poetics were taken to be its last books). It is followed\nby Aristotle's Categories, De interpretatione,\nPrior and Posterior Analytics.\n\nThis choice of texts shows that the Ikhw\u00e2n conform to the\n\u201cold\u201d tradition that restricted research to the first\nBooks of the Organon, not to that of their great contemporary\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, who expanded it to the whole logical\ncorpus. This might be due to the religious aims of the\nencyclopedia. Religious matters can only be treated by relying on the\nsound (sah\u00eeh) method for knowledge, while procedures\naiming at mere persuasion or linked to the attainment of that which is\nuseful (and not true) are not to be employed. Logic is no longer a\nsimple instrument of science as it was for Aristotle, but a true\nscience, perhaps the most important one. The Brethren call it\n\u201cthe scale of sciences\u201d through which the wise men are\nable to discern \u201ctrue from false in speeches, right from wrong\nin opinions, truth from vanity in beliefs and good from evil in\nacts\u201d (cf., e.g., Epistle 7, I, 268, 14\u201316).\n\nEpistle 7 On the theoretical arts carefully sketches the\nIkhw\u00e2n's epistemological vision. A sort of \u201ctable\u201d\nof human sciences is given (I, 266, 14\u2013274, 21). There are three\nkinds of sciences in hierarchical progression: the\n\u201cpropaedeutical\u201d (or preparatory,\nal-riy\u00e2diyya again; \u201ca designation not absolutely\nunambiguous\u201d according to de Callata\u00ff in El-Bizri; de\nCallata\u00ff 2017, 78 ff.), those imposed by religious Law\n(al-shar\u2018iyya al-wad\u2018iyya) and the\n\u201cphilosophical sciences allowing the full comprehension of\ntruth\u201d (al-falsafiyya al-haq\u00eeqiyya, higher than\nthe religious sciences). The sciences listed first in the table are\nlabelled \u201cpropaedeutical\u201d just as the\n\u201ctrivium\u201d and \u201cquadrivium\u201d sciences of the\nencyclopedia, but here the term is used in a totally different sense.\nIt concerns matters of practical utility, such as reading and writing,\ngrammar and poetry (someway close to the \u201ctrivium\u201d\nsciences), but also magic, mechanics, arts, trades, history and so on.\nAlthough the Ikhw\u00e2n state that the sciences of the third group\n\u2013 the \u201cphilosophical\u201d in the higher sense of the\nword \u2013 are the object of their Epistles, they do not coincide\nexactly with the contents of the encyclopedia, at least, with those of\nthe corpus now available. So, the table can be considered as\nevidence of the fact that the whole encyclopedia has been produced\nduring a very long period of time. On the one hand, it might have been\nretained as a first draft of the future enterprise; on the other, it\nshows the further elaborations of the corpus over the\ncenturies.\n\nEpistles 7 and 8 explicitly recall the Aristotelian division of the\ntheoretical and practical sciences. Epistle 7 is extensively based on\nAristotle (when the Ikhw\u00e2n introduce the nine\n\u201cphilosophical questions,\u201d they are thinking of the\nAristotelian categories, cf. I, 262, 14\u2013266, 7; Epistle 29, III,\n35, 6\u20137; Epistle 40, III, 345, 6\u2013346, 6; Epistle 42, III,\n513, 14\u201316 and 514, 13\u2013516, 5). However, the ultimate goal\nof the scientific investigation is identified with the path towards\nhereafter and even connected to asceticism where scientists and\nprophets follow the same way: Aristotelian science is linked to the\nIsma\u2018ili teaching (ta\u2018l\u00eem, cf. I, 274,\n20\u2013275, 4). The \u201cprogrammatic\u201d aim of Epistle 7\nleads us to consider it as the ideal introduction to the whole\ncorpus. On the other hand, the authors'\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli commitment is proven by the fact that in\nthe complementary treatise On the practical arts the ancient\n\u201cbanausic\u201d (utilitarian) activities are dealt with which\nwere held in high esteem in Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelism (cf. Lewis\n1943; Marquet 1961; and, more recently, Yasien 2006 and Daftary 2007,\n115).\n\nAlthough the content of the first section is the most\n\u201cuniform,\u201d inconsistencies are found already in it. This\nis especially clear in Epistle 9, which portrays the \u201cideal wise\nman\u201d from the standpoint of the encyclopedia, where moral\nedification is never separated from theoretical teaching. The approach\nis more than an echo of the well known Aristotelian division of\nphilosophy: it stems from the view of the Ikhw\u00e2n that he who\nsearches for true wisdom must be endowed with a true mind as well as a\npure heart. Epistle 9 breaks the series of the scientific treatises.\nVarious moral behaviours are considered, with the support of a long\nseries of anecdotes about prophets and wise men, which\nprovide textual evidence that the Ikhw\u00e2n may in practice\nhave found asceticism (Sufism?) as another way of attaining or\n\u201cenhancing\u201d purification (cf. Epistles 6, 16 and 24).\n\nThe composed and eclectic character of the whole is even more evident\nin the three other sections. In the second section, the Epistles\n15\u201322 follow the Hellenistic arrangement of Aristotle's works on\nphysics. Epistle 15 echoes the themes addressed in the\nPhysics. In Epistle 16, entitled, On the heaven and the\nworld, the Ikhw\u00e2n are shown to be in line with the Muslim\ntradition which transformed the ancient De caelo into a new\nbook De caelo et mundo. Epistle 17 deals with De\ngeneratione and corruptione. Epistle 18 about meteorological\nphenomena and Epistle 19 about minerals recall the contents of\nMeteorology I-III and IV respectively. Meteor. IV,\nsometimes considered spurious and \u201cthe first chemical work in\nancient world\u201d according to scholars, was the basis of the\ntheories of \u201cchemical\u201d or \u201calchemical\u201d\ntransformations in Islamic sciences and of mineralogy. The Ikhwanian\ntreatise deals with mineralogy, geology and gemmology and in the\ncorrespondence established between the celestial and sub-lunar worlds,\nbetween the stars and minerals, it expresses one of the main tenets of\nalchemy. Further Aristotelian echoes are found in Epistle 24 On\nsense and sensation, to which Epistle 35 On intellect and\nintelligible corresponds in the third section. After topics\nconcerning nature, such as the human body in Epistle 23, conception in\nEpistle 25, and man as microcosm in Epistle 26 [on the relationship\nbetween micro- an macrocosm see Maukola, 2009 and, in quite a new\nperspective, Nokso-Koivisto, 2011) the most important topic for the\nIkhw\u00e2n, the human spiritual dimension is addressed. It is\ndiscussed in terms of the relationship between soul and body in\nEpistles 27 e 28, life and death in Epistle 29, and pleasures in\nEpistle 30. The Aristotelian theory of the immovable mover, which is\nintroduced in Epistle 37 On love, to explain the movement\nimparted to stars by the heavenly Universal Soul accomplishes its\nreligious meaning. It serves to confirm the love human beings feel for\npermanence and their hatred for death: God is the most beloved as the\neverlasting cause of all beings.\n\nOn the other hand, natural treatises reflect the availability of the\nrich range of mineralogical, botanical and agricultural works, but\nnone of the works by Aristotle on minerals or plants were known to the\nArabs. The corpus aristotelicum on animals reached\nthem (apart from the De partibus and the De generatione\nanimalium) in an abridged form under the title of Kit\u00e2b\nal-hayaw\u00e2n, but Epistle 22 On animals is quite far\nin its content and goals from the Aristotelian corpus. In\nfact, it places the whole matter within the well-known metaphysical\ndispute on the superiority of man on animals (besides some attempts of\nviewing it even in an \"ecological perspective\"; see, more recently,\nDarraz 2012; Raymond 2014, 151). .\n\nThe authors' view of embryology (Epistle 25) is also a collection from\ndifferent sources. On the one hand, the Ikhw\u00e2n were not\nphysicians, though they display extensive knowledge of anatomy and\nshare the Aristotelian thesis of the origin of the embryo from the\nsperm and menstrual blood, while they did not accept the ancient\nHippocratic theory as developed by Galen, of a female sperm coexisting\nwith that of the male in the formation of the human being. On the\nother hand, they emphasize an astronomical/astrological approach to\nembryology that was not in Greek sources. It is considered to be a new\nidea introduced by Islamic scientists, from whom it passed into the\nLatin world. Greek sources for Epistle 37 on love also vary.\n\nThe real deviation from Aristotelianism is Epistle 20 On\nnature. In that it shows how nature as taught by Aristotle was\nreceived and theorized by the authors, this treatise could serve as\nthe perfect introduction to the section on natural sciences. However,\nits main part regards angelology. It also introduces a Neoplatonically\ninspired conception of Nature, suggestive of\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli philosophical positions, as Ab\u00fb\nYa\u2018q\u00fbb al-Sijist\u00e2n\u00ee's representation of Nature\nas \u201cagent power\u201d and \u201cprinciple of\nmovement\u201d.\n\nThough the Ikhw\u00e2n never mention Plotinus explicitly, the third\nsection opens with two treatises that deal with rational beings as\nunderstood by the Pythagoreans (Epistle 32) and the Ikhw\u00e2n\nal-Saf\u00e2\u2019 (Epistle 33). These treatises demonstrate beyond\ndoubt that these authors considered themselves true Muslim\nPythagoreans. Pythagoras is said to be \u201ca monotheist from\nHarr\u00e2n.\u201d The Pythagorean idea of the one as the\nprinciple of numbers, and not as a number itself explains that God is\nthe origin of beings, and not a being like others. If God is like the\none, the Active Intellect is compared to number 2, the Universal Soul\nto number 3 and Nature (or Matter) to number 4 (cf. e.g. Epistle 40,\nIII, 347, 5). The encyclopedia resumes Pythagorean mathematical and\nmusical theories and adopts a numerological approach on the basis of\nthe Pythagorean tenet that \u201cexisting beings correspond to the\nnature of number.\u201d The whole reality is considered under a\nnumerological perspective. Every aspect of nature \u2013 and even of\nreligion \u2013 follows a numeric pattern. This should demonstrate\nthat the cosmos \u2013 also introduced as a\n\u201cmacranthropos\u201d (man as the pattern of the external world\nas a whole) in Epistle 34 \u2013 is organized according to recurrent\nand well-determined quantitative models, being at the same time\ncompletely dependent on God, the principle of everything just as one\nis the root of each number. According to de Callata\u00ff,\nAristotelian themes are \u201creshaped\u201d, for didactic purposes,\nin a Neoplatonic frame (El-Bizri; de Callata\u00ff 2017, 88), so that\nthose who organized the corpus in its final version \u201care\ndefinitely to be ranged amongst hard-line Neoplatonists in medieval\nIslam\u201d (El-Bizri; de Callata\u00ff 2017, 89).\n\nAmong the other philosophical schools and doctrines quoted in the\nencyclopedia an important role is played by hermetism (the religion of\nthe philosophical elite in Ancient Egypt, founded by Hermes\nTrismegistus), as in Epistle 3 On astronomy and, more\nbroadly, in Epistle 52 (Marquet 1973, 1988). Ancient theories on the\nmovements of the stars will finally evolve in Epistle 36 On cycles\nand revolutions into that which, following Cumont, G. de\nCallata\u00ff (1996, 36\u201337) has defined as a \u201cfatalisme\nastral.\u201d\n",
