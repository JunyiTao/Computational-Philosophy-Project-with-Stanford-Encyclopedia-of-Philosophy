    "main_text": "Moral Intuitions and Conceptual Analysis || An Example: Intentionality and Responsibility\n2.3 An Example: Intentionality and Responsibility\n\nSince Knobe\u2019s seminal (2003) paper, experimental philosophers\nhave investigated the complex patterns in people\u2019s dispositions\nto make judgments about moral notions (praiseworthiness,\nblameworthiness, responsibility), cognitive attitudes (belief,\nknowledge, remembering), motivational attitudes (desire, favor,\nadvocacy), and character traits (compassion, callousness) in the\ncontext of violations of and conformity to various norms (moral,\nprudential, aesthetic, legal, conventional,\n descriptive).[4]\n In Knobe\u2019s original experiment, participants first read a\ndescription of a choice scenario: the protagonist is presented with a\npotential policy (aimed at increasing profits) that would result in a\nside effect (either harming or helping the environment). Next, the\nprotagonist explicitly disavows caring about the side effect, and\nchooses to go ahead with the policy. The policy results as advertised:\nboth the primary and the side effect occur. Participants are asked to\nattribute intentionality or an attitude (or, in the case of later work\nby Robinson et al. 2013, a character trait) to the protagonist. What\nKnobe found was that participants were significantly more inclined to\nindicate that the protagonist had intentionally brought about the side\neffect when it was perceived to be bad (harming the environment) than\nwhen it was perceived to be good (helping the environment). This\neffect has been replicated dozens of times, and its scope has been\ngreatly expanded from intentionality attributions after violations of\na moral norm to attributions of diverse properties after violations of\na wide variety of norms.\n\nThe first-order aim of interpreters of this body of evidence is to\ncreate a model that predicts when the attribution asymmetry will crop\nup. The second-order aims are to explain as systematically as possible\nwhy the effect occurs, and to determine the extent to which the\nattribution asymmetry can be considered rational. Figure 1, presented\nhere for the first time, models how participants\u2019 responses to\nthis sort of vignette are produced (for a different, neuroscientific\napproach, see Ngo et al. 2015):\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Model of Participant Response\nto Experimental Philosophy Vignettes\n\n\nIn this model, the boxes represent constructs, the arrows represent\ncausal or functional influences, and the area in grey represents the\nmind of the participant, which is not directly observable but is the\ntarget of investigation. In broad strokes, the idea is that a\nparticipant first reads the text of the vignette and forms a mental\nmodel of what happens in the story. On the basis of this model (and\nalmost certainly while the vignette is still being read), the\nparticipant begins to interpret, i.e., to make both descriptive and\nnormative judgments about the scenario, especially about the mental\nstates and character traits of the people in it. The participant then\nreads the experimenter\u2019s question, forms a mental model of what\nis being asked, and\u2014based on her judgments about the\nscenario\u2014forms an answer to that question. That answer may then\nbe pragmatically revised (to avoid unwanted implications, to bring it\nmore into accord with what the participant thinks the experimenter\nwants to hear, etc.) and is finally recorded as an explicit response\nto a statement about the protagonist\u2019s attitudes (e.g.,\n\u201che brought about the side effect intentionally,\u201d graded\non a Likert\n scale).[5]\n\nA result that has been replicated repeatedly is that, when the\nvignette describes a norm violation, subjects indicate that they agree\nmore strongly that the action violating the norm was performed\nintentionally. While this finding could be used by proponents of the\nnegative program to undermine the conceptual coherence of our notion\nof moral responsibility, experimental moral philosophers working in\nthe positive program have taken up the task of explaining the\nasymmetry by postulating models of unobservable entities that mediate,\nexplain, and perhaps even rationalize the asymmetry. A discussion of\nseveral attempts to do so follows; each offers a different explanation\nof the asymmetry, but all represent vindications or at least\nrehabilitations of our intuitions about intention.\n\nThe Conceptual Competence Model\n\nPerhaps the best known is Knobe\u2019s conceptual competence model,\naccording to which the asymmetry arises at the judgment stage. On this\nview, normative judgments about the action influence otherwise\ndescriptive judgments about whether it was intentional (or desired, or\nexpected, etc.). Moreover, this influence is taken to be part of the\nvery conception of intentionality (desire, belief, etc.). Thus, on the\nconceptual competence model, the asymmetry in attributions is a\nrational expression of the ordinary conception of intentionality\n(desire, belief, etc.), which turns out to have a normative component\n(see Machery 2008 for doubts about how to circumscribe what is part of\nthe conceptual competence with any given\n concept).[6]\n\nThe Motivational Bias Model\n\nThe motivational bias model (Alicke 2008; Nadelhoffer 2004, 2006)\nagrees that the asymmetry originates in the judgment stage, and that\nnormative judgments influence descriptive judgments. However, unlike\nthe conceptual competence model, it takes this to be a bias rather\nthan an expression of conceptual competence. Thus, on this model, the\nasymmetry in attributions is a distortion of the correct conception of\nintentionality (desire, belief, etc.).\n\nThe Deep Self Model\n\nThe deep self concordance model (Sripada 2010, 2012; Sripada &\nKonrath 2011) also locates the source of the asymmetry in the judgment\nstage, but does not recognize an influence (licit or illicit) of\nnormative judgments on descriptive judgments. Instead, proponents of\nthis model claim that when assessing intentional action, people not\nonly attend to their representation of a person\u2019s\n\u201csurface\u201d self\u2014her expectations, means-end beliefs,\nmoment-to-moment intentions, and conditional desires\u2014but also to\ntheir representation of the person\u2019s \u201cdeep\u201d self,\nwhich harbors her sentiments, values, and core principles (for\ncritical discussion, see Rose et al. 2012). According to this model,\nwhen assessing whether someone intentionally brings about some state\nof affairs, people determine (typically unconsciously) whether there\nexists sufficient concordance between their representation of the\noutcome the agent brings about and what they take to be her deep self.\nFor instance, when the chairman says he does not care at all about\neither harming or helping the environment, people attribute to him a\ndeeply anti-environment stance. When he harms the environment, this is\nconcordant with his anti-environment deep self; in contrast, when the\nchairman helps the environment, this is discordant with his\nanti-environment deep self. According to the deep self concordance\nmodel, then, the asymmetry in attributions is a reasonable expression\nof the folk psychological distinction between the deep and shallow\nself.\n\nThe Conversational Pragmatics Model\n\nUnlike the models discussed so far, the conversational pragmatics\nmodel (Adams & Steadman 2004, 2007; Lindauer & Southwood 2021)\nlocates the source of the asymmetry in the pragmatic revision stage.\nAccording to this model, participants judge the protagonist not to\nhave acted intentionally in both norm-conforming and norm-violating\ncases. However, when it comes time to tell the experimenter what they\nthink, participants do not want to be taken as suggesting that the\nharm-causing protagonist is blameless, so they report that he acted\nintentionally. This is a reasonable goal, so according to the\npragmatic revision model, the attribution asymmetry is rational,\nthough misleading.\n\nThe Trade-Off Model\n\nThe trade-off model (Machery 2008) disagrees with the previous models\nabout the location of the source of the asymmetry: it locates it in\nthe interpretation of the scenario. It proposes that when people\nread that the chairman agrees to harm the environment, they\nconceptualize the side effect harming the\nenvironment as a cost, that is, as something that is\nnegatively valued and that one must incur if one is to reap a greater\nbenefit. People think of this cost as being offset by the\nbenefit increasing the profits of the company. That is,\nthey conceptualize the harm case as involving a trade-off between a\ncost and a benefit. The side effect helping the\nenvironment cannot be conceptualized in this way since\nit cannot be plausibly thought of as a cost. Since people think of\ncosts as being intentionally incurred in order to reap some foreseen\nbenefits, the side effect is judged to be intentional in the former\nsituation, but not in the latter situation.  \n\nThe Deliberation Model\n\nLike the trade-off model, according to the deliberation model (Alfano,\nBeebe, & Robinson 2012; Robinson, Stey, & Alfano 2013; Scaife\n& Webber 2013), the best explanation of the complex patterns of\nevidence is that the very first mental stage, the formation of a\nmental model of the scenario, differs between norm-violation and\nnorm-conformity vignettes. When the protagonist is told that a policy\nhe would ordinarily want to pursue violates a norm, he acquires a\nreason to deliberate further about what to do; in contrast, when the\nprotagonist is told that the policy conforms to some norm, he acquires\nno such reason. Participants tend to think of the protagonist as\ndeliberating about what to do when and only when a norm would be\nviolated. Since deliberation leads to the formation of other mental\nstates such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, this basal difference\nbetween participants\u2019 models of what happens in the story flows\nthrough the rest of their interpretation and leads to the attribution\nasymmetry. On the deliberation model, then, the attribution asymmetry\noriginates earlier than other experimental philosophers suppose, and\nis due to rational processes.\n",
