    "main_text": "Perennial difficulties for metaethical theological voluntarism || Theological voluntarism and God\u2019s goodness\n3.1 Theological voluntarism and God\u2019s goodness\n\nGod is, by definition, good. This is both a fixed point concerning\nGod\u2019s nature and a plausibility-making feature of theological\nvoluntarism. If one were to deny that God is good (understood de\ndicto\u2014that is, \u2018if there is a being that qualifies as\nGod, then that being is good\u2019), one would call one\u2019s own\ncompetence in use of the term \u2018God\u2019 into question. And\neven if it were allowed that one can employ the term \u2018God\u2019\nmasterfully while denying that God is good, if one were to deny that\nGod is good, then one would undercut one\u2019s capacity to defend\ntheological voluntarism. For theological voluntarism is plausible only\nif God is an exalted being; but a being that is not good is not an\nexalted being.\n\nThat God is good is a fixed point for theistic discourse in general\nand for theological voluntarism in particular provides the basis for a\ncommon objection to theological voluntarism: that theological\nvoluntarism makes it impossible to say that, in any substantive sense,\nGod is good. The most straightforward formulation of the objection is\nas follows. For God to be good is for God to be morally good. But if\nmoral goodness is to be understood in theological voluntarist terms,\nthen God\u2019s goodness consists only in God\u2019s measuring up to\na standard that God has set for Godself. While this is perhaps an\nadmirable resoluteness\u2014it is, other things being equal, a good\nthing to live up to your own standards\u2014it is hardly the sort of\nthing that provokes in us the admiration that God\u2019s goodness is\nsupposed to provoke.\n\nNow, one might dispute the claim that if God\u2019s goodness consists\nsimply in God\u2019s living up to a standard that God has set for\nHimself, then that goodness is far less admirable than we would have\nsupposed. (See, for a nice discussion of this issue, Clark 1982, esp.\npp. 341\u2013343.) Suppose, though, that we grant this part of the\nargument. How powerful is the objection from God\u2019s goodness\nagainst theological voluntarism?\n\nAs we noted earlier, theological voluntarism comes in a variety of\nstrengths. One dimension along which a theological voluntarist view\nmight be assessed as stronger or weaker is in terms of the range of\nnormative properties that it attempts to account for in theological\nvoluntarist terms. The strength of the objection from God\u2019s\ngoodness is directly proportional to the size of the range of\nnormative properties that one wishes to explain in theological\nvoluntarist terms (see also Alston 1990). If one wishes only to\naccount for a proper subset of moral notions, such as obligation, with\none\u2019s theological voluntarism, then the objection from\nGod\u2019s goodness is very weak; if one wishes to provide a sweeping\naccount of normativity in theological voluntarist terms, then the\nobjection is much stronger.\n\nSuppose, for example, that one defends a version of theological\nvoluntarism that accounts only for obligation. If moral obligation\nonly is dependent on acts of the divine will, one can appeal to moral\nnotions other than deontic ones in order to provide a substantive\nsense in which God is good. Granting to some extent the force of the\nobjection, we can say, on this view, that God\u2019s moral goodness\ncannot consist in God\u2019s adhering to what is morally obligatory.\nBut there are other ways to assess God morally other than in terms of\nthe morally obligatory. Adams, for example, holds that God should be\nunderstood as benevolent and as just, and indeed concedes that his\ntheological voluntarist account of obligation as the divinely\ncommanded is implausible unless God is thus understood (Adams 1999,\npp. 253\u2013255). The ascription to God of these moral virtues is\nentirely consistent with his theological voluntarism, for his\ntheological voluntarism is not meant to provide any account of the\nmoral virtues. One can hold that God\u2019s moral goodness involves\nsupereminent possession of the virtues, at least insofar as those\nvirtues do not presuppose weakness and vulnerability. God is good\nbecause God is supremely just, loyal, faithful, benevolent, and so\nforth. It seems that ascribing to God supereminent possession of these\nvirtues would be enough to account for God\u2019s supreme moral\ngoodness: it is, after all, in such terms that God is praised in the\nPsalms.\n\nIt has been argued that this appeal to God\u2019s justice is\nillegitimate within a theological voluntarist account, because what is\njust is a matter of moral requirement, and so to suppose that\nGod\u2019s acting justly is metaphysically prior to God\u2019s\nimposing all moral requirements by way of commanding is incoherent\n(Hooker 2001, p. 334). But the theological voluntarist may deny that\nacting justly is morally required prior to God\u2019s commanding it,\nany more than acting courageously, temperately, or prudently are\nmorally required prior to God\u2019s commanding us to act\ncourageously, temperately, or prudently. Just as one can coherently\nacknowledge the excellence of temperance while wondering whether one\nis morally obligated to act temperately, one can coherently\nacknowledge the excellence of justice while wondering whether one is\nmorally obligated to act justly. It thus seems an available strategy\nfor the theological voluntarist who holds a restricted view of the\nrange of moral properties explained by God\u2019s commands/intentions\nto appeal to justice in accounting for God\u2019s goodness. \n\nMatters become more difficult for theological voluntarist views that\naim to provide accounts of all moral notions in terms of God\u2019s\nwill. If one held to such an ambitious version of theological\nvoluntarism\u2014if one were to hold, say, that a state of affairs is\nmorally good because it is a state of affairs that God wishes to\nobtain for its own sake, and that a character trait is a moral virtue\nbecause it is a property that God wants one to have for its own sake,\nand that an action is morally obligatory because it is antecedently\nintended by God, and so forth\u2014then obviously the gambit employed\nby the less ambitious theological voluntarist is unavailable. The more\nambitious theological voluntarist should hold, instead, that\nGod\u2019s goodness is not to be understood in moral terms.\nGod\u2019s being good might be understood in terms of God\u2019s\nbeing good to us, where us includes all created rational\nbeings, or all created sentient beings, or whatever class of created\nbeings to which one thinks that God has a special relationship. What\nit is for God to be good to us would be for God to be loving\u2014to\nwill each of our goods, and to do so in a way that plays no favorites.\nThis understanding of \u2018loving\u2019 does not run afoul of\ntheological voluntarism construed as an account of all moral goods,\nbecause \u2018our goods\u2019 is to be interpreted in terms of\nprudential goodness, what makes each of us well-off (but see Chandler\n1985).\n\nSuppose, though, that one were to go all the way, holding that\ntheological voluntarism is the correct account of all normative\nnotions: on this extremely ambitious view, anything that is\nintrinsically action-guiding depends on God\u2019s will. I think that\nthe \u2018God is good to us\u2019 understanding of God\u2019s\ngoodness is ruled out on this approach: for the notion of \u2018good\nto us\u2019 is a normative notion. Perhaps one could hold, on this\nview, that \u2018God is good\u2019 affirms of God some sort of\nmetaphysical goodness, fullness of being. This surely makes God\nexalted, but it is not clear whether the will of such a being is\nplausibly understood as the source of all normative statuses. It is\nalso less than clear that \u2018God is good,\u2019 on this reading,\nis the claim that God possesses a particular perfection, rather than\nis merely a reminder that God has a variety of perfections.\n\nTo sum up, then: for each of the various formulations of theological\nvoluntarism, there seems to be some way of answering the charge that\nthe view undercuts the notion that God is good. But the strain needed\nto answer the charge becomes greater the wider the range of normative\nproperties that the formulation of theological voluntarism aims to\nexplain.\n",
