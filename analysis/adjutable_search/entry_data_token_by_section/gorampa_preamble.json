    "main_text": "\n\nGorampa Sonam Senge (Go rams pa bSod nams Seng ge, 1429\u201389) is\none of the most widely-studied philosophers in the Sakya (sa\nskya) school of Tibetan Buddhism. A fierce critic of Tsongkhapa,\nthe founder of what later came to be known as the Gelug (dge\nlugs) school, his works were so controversial that they were\nsuppressed by Gelug leaders shortly after they were composed.\nGorampa\u2019s texts remained hidden until the early 20th century,\nwhen the monk Jamgyal Rinpoche received permission from the thirteenth\nDalai Lama to collect Gorampa\u2019s extant texts and have them\nreprinted in Derge. Today, Gorampa\u2019s philosophy is studied\nwidely in monastic colleges, not only in those affiliated with his own\nSakya tradition, but also in institutions affiliated with the Kagyu\n(bka' brgyud) and Nyingma (rnying ma) schools.\n\nGorampa, like most Tibetan Buddhist philosophers, considers himself a\nfollower of the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school developed by the Indian\nphilosopher N\u0101g\u0101rjuna in the second century, CE. His views\nwith respect to particular issues within Madhyamaka, however, differ\nsignificantly from the views of scholars belonging to other sects of\nTibetan Buddhism (e.g., Tsongkhapa and Dolpopa), and at times, his\nviews even differ from those of other Sakya scholars (most notably\n\u015a\u0101kya Chokden). Gorampa\u2019s particular brand of\nMadhyamaka philosophy is defined by his understanding of the\nrelationship between the two truths, the use of negation, the role of\nlogic, and proper methods of philosophical argumentation.\n",
