    "main_text": "Belief, its Aims, and Our Control Over It || The aim(s) of belief\n3.2 The aim(s) of belief\n\nBy contrast, theories about the aim or goal of\nbelief typically have an immediate and substantive impact on\nconceptions of its ethics, and can be used, in particular, to answer\nquestions about the relative importance of various norms, whether\nthere are \u201call things considered\u201d obligations in a given\nsituation, and so on (see Velleman 2000, Wedgwood 2002,\nSteglich-Peterson 2009, and the essays in Chan 2013 for general\ndiscussion; see C\u00f4t\u00e9-Bouchard forthcoming for a critique\nof the move from aim of belief to doxastic norm).\n\nA few philosophers and psychologists argue that simply acquiring\nsignificant truth while avoiding significant\nfalsehood is the only aim of belief, and thus that any doxastic\nobligations will be structured accordingly (see David 2001). Others\nargue that there are important aims in addition to, or even in lieu\nof, the aim of truth-acquisition\u2014aims that can underwrite other\ndoxastic norms (Velleman 2000, Sosa 2000, Sosa 2003, Gibbons 2013). A\ncommon candidate here, of course, is knowledge itself (see Williamson\n2000, Pritchard 2007, Simion et al. 2016 and the entry on the\n value of knowledge),\n but some authors claim that justification (Adler 2002, Gibbons 2013)\nand/or doxastic \u201cvirtue\u201d is the aim (Zagzebski 2004, Sosa\n2011, Wright 2014), while still others plump for a more structurally\ncomplex aim such as \u201cunderstanding\u201d (Kvanvig 2003, Kvanvig\n2009, Grimm 2012). (Note, though, that other authors argue that\nunderstanding doesn\u2019t even involve belief (Hunter 1998;\nDells\u00e9n forthcoming)). \n\nAs mentioned earlier, in cognitive science and evolutionary biology,\nit is often assumed that the aim of belief (as well as of almost every\nother process) is something like \u201csurvival.\u201d There are\nongoing disagreements, however, about the extent to which that is\ncorrect and, even if it is, whether it is necessarily or even\ncontingently connected to the aim of truth-acquisition (Stich 1990,\nPlantinga 2002, Street 2006).\n\nA very different kind of candidate for the aim of belief would be\nsomething like pleasure broadly-speaking, or perhaps\n\u201cfeeling at home in the world.\u201d If one of these is the\naim, then the norms it underwrites might at times lead away\nfrom truth. For example: suppose Smith is the sort of guy who feels\ngreat pleasure when he believes that everyone he knows thinks highly\nof him, and pleasure is an aim that underwrites a doxastic norm. Then\nSmith has a prima facie obligation to believe that his friend\nJones thinks the world of him.\n\nThis is clearly one of the places where debates about psychological\nstrategies such as self-deception, \u201cbad faith,\u201d\nwish-fulfillment, \u201cirony,\u201d and the like become germane in\nthe ethics of belief (see Wisdo 1991, Wisdo 1993, Mele 2001, Wood\n2002, and the entry on\n self deception).\n If the aims of belief can plausibly be regarded as wide\nenough to include truth-neutral states such as pleasure or\n\u201cfeeling at home in the world,\u201d and if these aims can\nunderwrite genuine norms, then Evidentialism as characterized below\nclearly delivers a far-too-narrow characterization of its ethics.\n\nWe have seen that our conception of the aim of belief can influence\nour conception of doxastic norms. But it can also affect the extent to\nwhich parallels can be drawn between the ethics of belief and the\nethics of action generally. If one adopts \u201cvalue monism\u201d\nin the ethics of belief (whether it be veritism of some other\nkind of value), then there will be a strong parallel to monistic\nconsequentialist theories in the ethics of action (DePaul 2001). \n\nA remaining difference between consequentialism in epistemology and in\nethics, however, is that a belief\u2019s success at achieving its aim\nis typically evaluated by epistemologists all at once in the moment it\nis formed, whereas in the case of an action, subsequent consequences\nare relevant to the evaluation of its moral rightness, and many of\nthese consequences won\u2019t be known (if at all) until much later\n(for an extended comparison of these two kinds of consequentialism,\nsee Briesen 2017). That said, it is possible to imagine a diachronic\nethics of belief according to which truth is the sole aim of belief,\nbut we evaluate particular beliefs not just on whether they are true\nbut also on their ability to enable or produce the subsequent\nacquisition of other true beliefs.\n\nIf we have a theory according to which the aim of belief is complex,\nhowever, then parallels to the ethics of action become more\ncomplicated. An ethicist of belief who holds that acquiring\nsignificant truth in the right way is the aim of belief, and\nanalyzes the \u201crightness\u201d of a belief-forming practice in\nterms of its ability to lead to truth, may find that the relevant\nparallel is to rule-consequentialism. By contrast, the view that the\naim of belief is simply to believe in the right way,\nregardless of whether that \u201cright way\u201d reliably leads to\nsignficant truth, looks like the analogue of a deontological position\nin ethics that emphasizes the intentional following of right\nprinciples rather than the achievement of some aim external to the act\nitself. Whether or not these parallels are illuminating, and whether a\nview in the ethics of belief constrains our options in the ethics of\naction, is still an open question (see Kornblith 1983, Dougherty\n2014).\n\nThere are many other variations here. It seems possible to defend the\nview, for instance, that we ought only to believe on sufficient\nevidence\u2014as the Evidentialists teach\u2014but that our\nconception of the aims of belief might provide further and more\ndeterminate necessary conditions for permissible belief. It is also\npossible to argue that the aim of belief makes it the case that we\nhave practical reasons for thinking that only epistemic\nreasons can license belief (Whiting 2014). \n\nFinally, it may be possible to defend the view that belief by its\nnature has no specific aim, but is rather a state that can\nconstitute or lead to any number of different goods. If that is right,\nthen we obviously cannot look to the aim of belief to underwrite an\naccount of its ethics.\n",
