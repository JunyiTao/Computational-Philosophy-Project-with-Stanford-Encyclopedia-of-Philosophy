    "main_text": "Some Minor Issues Arising || Interpreting the Imitation Game\n3.1 Interpreting the Imitation Game\n\nTuring (1950) introduces the imitation game by describing a game in\nwhich the participants are a man, a woman, and a human interrogator.\nThe interrogator is in a room apart from the other two, and is set the\ntask of determining which of the other two is a man and which is a\nwoman. Both the man and the woman are set the task of trying to\nconvince the interrogator that they are the woman. Turing recommends\nthat the best strategy for the woman is to answer all questions\ntruthfully; of course, the best strategy for the man will require some\nlying. The participants in this game also use teletypewriter to\ncommunicate with one another\u2014to avoid clues that might be\noffered by tone of voice, etc. Turing then says: \u201cWe now ask the\nquestion, \u2018What will happen when a machine takes the part of A\nin this game?\u2019 Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often\nwhen the game is played like this as he does when the game is played\nbetween a man and a woman?\u201d (434).\n\nNow, of course, it is possible to interpret Turing as here\nintending to say what he seems literally to say, namely, that the new\ngame is one in which the computer must pretend to be a woman, and the\nother participant in the game is a woman. (For discussion, see, for\nexample, Genova (1994) and Traiger (2000).) And it is also\npossible to interpret Turing as intending to say that the new\ngame is one in which the computer must pretend to be a woman, and the\nother participant in the game is a man who must also pretend to be a\nwoman. However, as Copeland (2000), Piccinini (2000), and Moor (2001)\nconvincingly argue, the rest of Turing\u2019s article, and material\nin other articles that Turing wrote at around the same time, very\nstrongly support the claim that Turing actually intended the standard\ninterpretation that we gave above, viz. that the computer is to\npretend to be a human being, and the other participant in the game is\na human being of unspecified gender. Moreover, as Moor (2001) argues,\nthere is no reason to think that one would get a better test if the\ncomputer must pretend to be a woman and the other participant in the\ngame is a man pretending to be a woman; and, indeed, there is some\nreason to think that one would get a worse test. Perhaps it would make\nno difference to the effectiveness of the test if the computer must\npretend to be a woman, and the other participant is a woman (any more\nthan it would make a difference if the computer must pretend to be an\naccountant and the other participant is an accountant); however, this\nconsideration is simply insufficient to outweigh the strong textual\nevidence that supports the standard interpretation of the imitation\ngame that we gave at the beginning of our discussion of Turing (1950).\n(For a dissenting view about many of the matters discussed in this\nparagraph, see Sterrett (2000; 2020).)\n",
