    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Intellectual Background || The Philosophical Radicals\n1.1 The Philosophical Radicals\n\nSome of Mill\u2019s most significant innovations to the utilitarian\ntradition concern his claims about the nature of happiness and the\nrole of happiness in human motivation. Bentham and James Mill\nunderstand happiness hedonistically, as consisting in pleasure, and\nthey believe that the ultimate aim of each person is predominantly, if\nnot exclusively, the promotion of the agent\u2019s own happiness\n(pleasure).\n\nBentham begins his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and\nLegislation (1789) with this hedonistic assumption about human\nmotivation.\n\n\nNature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign\nmasters, pain and pleasure (Principles I\n1).\n\n\nBentham allows that we may be moved by the pleasures and pains of\nothers. But he appears to think that these other-regarding pleasures\ncan move us only insofar as we take pleasure in the pleasure of others\n(V 32). This suggests that Bentham endorses a version of psychological\negoism, which claims that the agent\u2019s own happiness is and can\nbe the only ultimate object of his desires. In his unfinished\nConstitutional Code (1832), Bentham makes this commitment to\npsychological egoism clear.\n\n\nOn the occasion of every act he exercises, every human being is led to\npursue that line of conduct which, according to his view of the case,\ntaken by him at the moment, will be in the highest degree contributory\nto his own greatest happiness. (Introduction, \u00a72)\n\n\nBentham is a hedonist about utility or happiness, treating happiness\nas consisting in pleasure (Principles I 3). So the version of\npsychological egoism to which he is attracted is psychological\nhedonism. Bentham does not say why he believes that one\u2019s own\npleasure is the only ultimate object of desire. He may see it as a\ngeneralization from his observations about the motives underlying\nhuman behavior.\n\nJames Mill also treats psychological hedonism as axiomatic in his\nEssay on Government (1824).\n\n\nThe desire, therefore, of that power which is necessary to render the\npersons and properties of human beings subservient to our pleasures,\nis the grand governing law of human nature. (\u00a7IV; also see\n\u00a7V)\n\n\nSometimes, Bentham appears to allow for a more diverse set of ultimate\nmotives or interests, including other-regarding motives\n(Principles X 25, X 36\u201338, XI 31; Table of the\nSprings of Action II 2). But these concessions to psychological\npluralism are exceptional. Even in contexts where Bentham recognizes\nmotivation that is not ultimately self-interested, he appears to treat\nit as weaker and less dependable than self-interested motivation\n(Book of Fallacies 392\u201393).\n\nBentham claims that utility not only describes human motivation but\nalso sets the standard of right and wrong (Principles I\n1).\n\n\nBy the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or\ndisapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency\nwhich it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the\nparty whose interest is in question \u2026. (Principles I\n2)\n\n\nIt remains to be determined whose happiness matters. One might imagine\nthat it is the utility of the agent. This would be the ethical\ncounterpart to psychological egoism. However, Bentham\u2019s answer,\nand the answer characteristic of utilitarianism, is the happiness of\nall (Principles I 4\u201310). Bentham says that our account\nof right action, obligation, and duty ought to be governed by the\nprinciple of utility (I 9\u201310). This seems to imply that an\naction is right or obligatory just insofar as it promotes utility. But\nthen the right or obligatory act would seem to be the one that\npromotes utility the most or maximizes utility. For these\nreasons, it is common to understand Bentham as combining psychological\nhedonism and hedonistic utilitarianism.\n\nBut, if this is Bentham\u2019s view, he faces a problem, for he\ncombines the ethical claim that each of us ought to aim at the general\nhappiness (pleasure) with the psychological claim that each of us can\nonly aim (ultimately) at his own happiness (pleasure). Here we seem to\nhave a special case of the conflict between psychological egoism and\nmorality\u2019s other-regarding or altruistic demands.\n\nBentham is not unaware of this tension. He addresses part of the\nproblem in the political context in other writings, notably his\nPlan for Parliamentary Reform (1817). In the political\ncontext, the problem is how we can get self-interested rulers to rule\nin the interest of the governed, as utilitarianism implies that they\nshould. Bentham\u2019s answer invokes his commitment to\nrepresentative democracy. We can reconcile self-interested motivation\nand promotion of the common good if we make rulers democratically\naccountable to (all) those whom they govern, for this tends to make\nthe interest of the governed and the interest of the governors\ncoincide. Bentham\u2019s argument, elaborated by James Mill in his\nEssay on Government, is something like this.\n\nEach person acts only (or predominantly) to promote his own\ninterests.\nThe proper object of government is the interest of the\ngoverned.\nHence, rulers will pursue the proper object of government if and\nonly if their interests coincide with those of the governed.\nA ruler\u2019s interest will coincide with those of the governed\nif and only if he is politically accountable to the governed.\nHence, rulers must be democratically accountable.\n\n\nIt was this reasoning that led Bentham and James Mill to advocate\ndemocratic reforms that included extending the franchise to workers\nand peasant farmers.\n\nIn Principles Chapter IV Bentham sets out his conception of\npleasure and utility in more detail, distinguishing between intrinsic\nand relational dimensions of pleasures. For our purposes, some\ndimensions matter more than others. Hedonism says that pleasure is the\none and only intrinsic good and that pain is the one and only\nintrinsic evil. All other things have only extrinsic or instrumental\nvalue depending on whether and, if so, how much pleasure or pain they\nproduce. Because the utilitarian asks us to maximize value, he has to\nbe able to make sense of quantities or magnitudes of value associated\nwith different options, where he assigns value to pleasure and\ndisvalue to pain. Intensity, duration, and extent would appear to be\nthe most relevant variables here. Each option is associated with\nvarious pleasures and pains both within a single life and across\nlives. For any given option we must find out how many pleasures and\npains it produces, whether those occur in a single life or in\ndifferent lives. For every distinct pleasure and pain, we must\ncalculate its intensity and its duration. That would give us the total\namount of (net) pleasure (or pain) associated with each option. Then\nwe must do that option with greatest total. If there are two (or more)\noptions with the greatest total, we are free to select any of\nthese.\n\nBentham does not assume that our estimates of what will maximize\nutility will always be reliable. Nor does he assume that we should\nalways try to maximize utility (Principles I 13, IV 6). Doing\nso is costly, and we may sometimes promote utility best by not trying\nto promote it directly. Nonetheless, utility, he thinks, is the\nstandard of right conduct.\n",
