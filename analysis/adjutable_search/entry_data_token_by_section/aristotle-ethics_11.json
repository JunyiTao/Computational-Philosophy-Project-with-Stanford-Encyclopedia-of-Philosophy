    "main_text": "Friendship\n9. Friendship\n\nThe topic of Books VIII and IX of the Ethics is friendship.\nAlthough it is difficult to avoid the term \u201cfriendship\u201d as\na translation of \u201cphilia\u201d, and this is an\naccurate term for the kind of relationship he is most interested in,\nwe should bear in mind that he is discussing a wider range of\nphenomena than this translation might lead us to expect, for the\nGreeks use the term, \u201cphilia\u201d, to name the\nrelationship that holds among family members, and do not reserve it\nfor voluntary relationships. Although Aristotle is interested in\nclassifying the different forms that friendship takes, his main theme\nin Books VIII and IX is to show the close relationship between\nvirtuous activity and friendship. He is vindicating his conception of\nhappiness as virtuous activity by showing how satisfying are the\nrelationships that a virtuous person can normally expect to have.\n\nHis taxonomy begins with the premise that there are three main reasons\nwhy one person might like someone else. (The verb,\n\u201cphilein\u201d, which is cognate to the noun\n\u201cphilia\u201d, can sometimes be translated\n\u201clike\u201d or even \u201clove\u201d\u2014though in other\ncases philia involves very little in the way of feeling.) One\nmight like someone because he is good, or because he is useful, or\nbecause he is pleasant. And so there are three bases for friendships,\ndepending on which of these qualities binds friends together. When two\nindividuals recognize that the other person is someone of good\ncharacter, and they spend time with each other, engaged in activities\nthat exercise their virtues, then they form one kind of friendship. If\nthey are equally virtuous, their friendship is perfect. If, however,\nthere is a large gap in their moral development (as between a parent\nand a small child, or between a husband and a wife), then although\ntheir relationship may be based on the other person\u2019s good\ncharacter, it will be imperfect precisely because of their\ninequality.\n\nThe imperfect friendships that Aristotle focuses on, however, are not\nunequal relationships based on good character. Rather, they are\nrelationships held together because each individual regards the other\nas the source of some advantage to himself or some pleasure he\nreceives. When Aristotle calls these relationships\n\u201cimperfect\u201d, he is tacitly relying on widely accepted\nassumptions about what makes a relationship satisfying. These\nfriendships are defective, and have a smaller claim to be called\n\u201cfriendships\u201d, because the individuals involved have\nlittle trust in each other, quarrel frequently, and are ready to break\noff their association abruptly. Aristotle does not mean to suggest\nthat unequal relations based on the mutual recognition of good\ncharacter are defective in these same ways. Rather, when he says that\nunequal relationships based on character are imperfect, his point is\nthat people are friends in the fullest sense when they gladly spend\ntheir days together in shared activities, and this close and constant\ninteraction is less available to those who are not equal in their\nmoral development.\n\nWhen Aristotle begins his discussion of friendship, he introduces a\nnotion that is central to his understanding of this phenomenon: a\ngenuine friend is someone who loves or likes another person for the\nsake of that other person. Wanting what is good for the sake of\nanother he calls \u201cgood will\u201d (eunoia), and\nfriendship is reciprocal good will, provided that each recognizes the\npresence of this attitude in the other. Does such good will exist in\nall three kinds of friendship, or is it confined to relationships\nbased on virtue? At first, Aristotle leaves open the first of these\ntwo possibilities. He says:\n\n\nit is necessary that friends bear good will to each other and wish\ngood things for each other, without this escaping their notice,\nbecause of one of the reasons mentioned. (1156a4\u20135)\n\n\nThe reasons mentioned are goodness, pleasure, and advantage; and so it\nseems that Aristotle is leaving room for the idea that in all three\nkinds of friendships, even those based on advantage and pleasure\nalone, the individuals wish each other well for the sake of the\nother.\n\nBut in fact, as Aristotle continues to develop his taxonomy, he does\nnot choose to exploit this possibility. He speaks as though it is only\nin friendships based on character that one finds a desire to benefit\nthe other person for the sake of the other person.\n\n\nThose who wish good things to their friends for the sake of the latter\nare friends most of all, because they do so because of their friends\nthemselves, and not coincidentally. (1156b9\u201311)\n\n\nWhen one benefits someone not because of the kind of person he is, but\nonly because of the advantages to oneself, then, Aristotle says, one\nis not a friend towards the other person, but only towards the profit\nthat comes one\u2019s way (1157a15\u201316).\n\nIn such statements as these, Aristotle comes rather close to saying\nthat relationships based on profit or pleasure should not be called\nfriendships at all. But he decides to stay close to common parlance\nand to use the term \u201cfriend\u201d loosely. Friendships based on\ncharacter are the ones in which each person benefits the other for the\nsake of other; and these are friendships most of all. Because each\nparty benefits the other, it is advantageous to form such friendships.\nAnd since each enjoys the trust and companionship of the other, there\nis considerable pleasure in these relationships as well. Because these\nperfect friendships produce advantages and pleasures for each of the\nparties, there is some basis for going along with common usage and\ncalling any relationship entered into for the sake of just one of\nthese goods a friendship. Friendships based on advantage alone or\npleasure alone deserve to be called friendships because in\nfull-fledged friendships these two properties, advantage and pleasure,\nare present. It is striking that in the Ethics Aristotle\nnever thinks of saying that the uniting factor in all friendships is\nthe desire each friend has for the good of the other.\n\nAristotle does not raise questions about what it is to desire good for\nthe sake of another person. He treats this as an easily understood\nphenomenon, and has no doubts about its existence. But it is also\nclear that he takes this motive to be compatible with a love of\none\u2019s own good and a desire for one\u2019s own happiness.\nSomeone who has practical wisdom will recognize that he needs friends\nand other resources in order to exercise his virtues over a long\nperiod of time. When he makes friends, and benefits friends he has\nmade, he will be aware of the fact that such a relationship is good\nfor him. And yet to have a friend is to want to benefit someone for\nthat other person\u2019s sake; it is not a merely self-interested\nstrategy. Aristotle sees no difficulty here, and rightly so. For there\nis no reason why acts of friendship should not be undertaken partly\nfor the good of one\u2019s friend and partly for one\u2019s own\ngood. Acting for the sake of another does not in itself demand\nself-sacrifice. It requires caring about someone other than oneself,\nbut does not demand some loss of care for oneself. For when we know\nhow to benefit a friend for his sake, we exercise the ethical virtues,\nand this is precisely what our happiness consists in.\n\nAristotle makes it clear that the number of people with whom one can\nsustain the kind of relationship he calls a perfect friendship is\nquite small (IX.10). Even if one lived in a city populated entirely by\nperfectly virtuous citizens, the number with whom one could carry on a\nfriendship of the perfect type would be at most a handful. For he\nthinks that this kind of friendship can exist only when one spends a\ngreat deal of time with the other person, participating in joint\nactivities and engaging in mutually beneficial behavior; and one\ncannot cooperate on these close terms with every member of the\npolitical community. One may well ask why this kind of close\nfriendship is necessary for happiness. If one lived in a community\nfilled with good people, and cooperated on an occasional basis with\neach of them, in a spirit of good will and admiration, would that not\nprovide sufficient scope for virtuous activity and a well-lived life?\nAdmittedly, close friends are often in a better position to benefit\neach other than are fellow citizens, who generally have little\nknowledge of one\u2019s individual circumstances. But this only shows\nthat it is advantageous to be on the receiving end of a friend\u2019s\nhelp. The more important question for Aristotle is why one needs to be\non the giving end of this relationship. And obviously the answer\ncannot be that one needs to give in order to receive; that would turn\nactive love for one\u2019s friend into a mere means to the benefits\nreceived.\n\nAristotle attempts to answer this question in IX.11, but his treatment\nis disappointing. His fullest argument depends crucially on the notion\nthat a friend is \u201canother self\u201d, someone, in other words,\nwith whom one has a relationship very similar to the relationship one\nhas with oneself. A virtuous person loves the recognition of himself\nas virtuous; to have a close friend is to possess yet another person,\nbesides oneself, whose virtue one can recognize at extremely close\nquarters; and so, it must be desirable to have someone very much like\noneself whose virtuous activity one can perceive. The argument is\nunconvincing because it does not explain why the perception of\nvirtuous activity in fellow citizens would not be an adequate\nsubstitute for the perception of virtue in one\u2019s friends.\n\nAristotle would be on stronger grounds if he could show that in the\nabsence of close friends one would be severely restricted in the kinds\nof virtuous activities one could undertake. But he cannot present such\nan argument, because he does not believe it. He says that it is\n\u201cfiner and more godlike\u201d to bring about the well being of\na whole city than to sustain the happiness of just one person\n(1094b7\u201310). He refuses to regard private life\u2014the realm\nof the household and the small circle of one\u2019s friends\u2014as\nthe best or most favorable location for the exercise of virtue. He is\nconvinced that the loss of this private sphere would greatly detract\nfrom a well-lived life, but he is hard put to explain why. He might\nhave done better to focus on the benefits of being the object of a\nclose friend\u2019s solicitude. Just as property is ill cared for\nwhen it is owned by all, and just as a child would be poorly nurtured\nwere he to receive no special parental care\u2014points Aristotle\nmakes in Politics II.2\u20135\u2014so in the absence of\nfriendship we would lose a benefit that could not be replaced by the\ncare of the larger community. But Aristotle is not looking for a\ndefense of this sort, because he conceives of friendship as lying\nprimarily in activity rather than receptivity. It is difficult, within\nhis framework, to show that virtuous activity towards a friend is a\nuniquely important good.\n\nSince Aristotle thinks that the pursuit of one\u2019s own happiness,\nproperly understood, requires ethically virtuous activity and will\ntherefore be of great value not only to one\u2019s friends but to the\nlarger political community as well, he argues that self-love is an\nentirely proper emotion\u2014provided it is expressed in the love of\nvirtue (IX.8). Self-love is rightly condemned when it consists in the\npursuit of as large a share of external goods\u2014particularly\nwealth and power\u2014as one can acquire, because such self-love\ninevitably brings one into conflict with others and undermines the\nstability of the political community. It may be tempting to cast\nAristotle\u2019s defense of self-love into modern terms by calling\nhim an egoist, and \u201cegoism\u201d is a broad enough term so\nthat, properly defined, it can be made to fit Aristotle\u2019s\nethical outlook. If egoism is the thesis that one will always act\nrightly if one consults one\u2019s self-interest, properly\nunderstood, then nothing would be amiss in identifying him as an\negoist.\n\nBut egoism is sometimes understood in a stronger sense. Just as\nconsequentialism is the thesis that one should maximize the general\ngood, whatever the good turns out to be, so egoism can be defined as\nthe parallel thesis that one should maximize one\u2019s own good,\nwhatever the good turns out to be. Egoism, in other words, can be\ntreated as a purely formal thesis: it holds that whether the good is\npleasure, or virtue, or the satisfaction of desires, one should not\nattempt to maximize the total amount of good in the world, but only\none\u2019s own. When egoism takes this abstract form, it is an\nexpression of the idea that the claims of others are never worth\nattending to, unless in some way or other their good can be shown to\nserve one\u2019s own. The only underived reason for action is\nself-interest; that an act helps another does not by itself provide a\nreason for performing it, unless some connection can be made between\nthe good of that other and one\u2019s own.\n\nThere is no reason to attribute this extreme form of egoism to\nAristotle. On the contrary, his defense of self-love makes it clear\nthat he is not willing to defend the bare idea that one ought to love\noneself alone or above others; he defends self-love only when this\nemotion is tied to the correct theory of where one\u2019s good lies,\nfor it is only in this way that he can show that self-love need not be\na destructive passion. He takes it for granted that self-love is\nproperly condemned whenever it can be shown to be harmful to the\ncommunity. It is praiseworthy only if it can be shown that a\nself-lover will be an admirable citizen. In making this assumption,\nAristotle reveals that he thinks that the claims of other members of\nthe community to proper treatment are intrinsically valid. This is\nprecisely what a strong form of egoism cannot accept.\n\nWe should also keep in mind Aristotle\u2019s statement in the\nPolitics that the political community is prior to the\nindividual citizen\u2014just as the whole body is prior to any of its\nparts (1253a18\u201329). Aristotle makes use of this claim when he\nproposes that in the ideal community each child should receive the\nsame education, and that the responsibility for providing such an\neducation should be taken out of the hands of private individuals and\nmade a matter of common concern (1337a21\u20137). No citizen, he\nsays, belongs to himself; all belong to the city (1337a28\u20139).\nWhat he means is that when it comes to such matters as education,\nwhich affect the good of all, each individual should be guided by the\ncollective decisions of the whole community. An individual citizen\ndoes not belong to himself, in the sense that it is not up to him\nalone to determine how he should act; he should subordinate his\nindividual decision-making powers to those of the whole. The strong\nform of egoism we have been discussing cannot accept Aristotle\u2019s\ndoctrine of the priority of the city to the individual. It tells the\nindividual that the good of others has, in itself, no valid claim on\nhim, but that he should serve other members of the community only to\nthe extent that he can connect their interests to his own. Such a\ndoctrine leaves no room for the thought that the individual citizen\ndoes not belong to himself but to the whole.\n",
