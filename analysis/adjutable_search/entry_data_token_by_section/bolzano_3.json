    "main_text": "Logic || Bolzano\u2019s Concept of Logic\n3.1 Bolzano\u2019s Concept of Logic\n\nThe term \u2018logic\u2019 was understood in Bolzano\u2019s time,\nas also by Bolzano himself, not in the narrow sense of formal logic,\nas it is commonly used nowadays, but rather in the broad sense which\nincludes \u2014 besides formal logic \u2014 also both epistemology\nand the philosophy of science. Thus Bolzano used instead of\n\u2018logic\u2019 also the term \u2018theory of science\u2019. By\n\u2018logic\u2019 or \u2018theory of science\u2019 Bolzano means\nthat discipline or science which formulates rules, \u201caccording to\nwhich we must proceed in the business of dividing the entire realm of\ntruth into single sciences and in the exposition thereof in special\ntextbooks if we want to proceed in a truly expedient fashion\u201d\n(WL I, 7; cf. also WL I, 19 and 56).\n\nThis definition of logic makes a strange impression at first glance\nand was also often misunderstood. By putting it forward, Bolzano\nascribes to logic a task that is generally not included in philosophy\nat all, but rather in the technique of scientific procedure. Bolzano,\nhowever, considered this task to be important enough to subject it to\na scientific treatment. Since he did not see how it could otherwise be\nbrought within the purview of a science, he assigned this task to\nlogic which seemed to him to be the best candidate for this. What\nBolzano mentions in his definition is, in his own view, by no means\nthe only task of logic. In order to avoid superfluous criteria,\nBolzano stated only the most concrete purpose in his definition, for\nthe other tasks are entailed by it. Bolzano\u2019s logic is a\ncomposite of the theory of foundations, the theory of\nelements, the theory of knowledge, the art of\ndiscovery (heuristics), and the theory of science\nproper. Thus, logic is, for Bolzano, an encompassing\nphilosophical discipline, and the \u201ctheory of science\nproper\u201d is only a sort of appendix of his logic.\n",
