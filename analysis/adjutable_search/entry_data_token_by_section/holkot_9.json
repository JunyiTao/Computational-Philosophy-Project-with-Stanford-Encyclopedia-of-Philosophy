Divine Foreknowledge\n\nDiscussions about the contingency of the created order and the various\nways necessity might impinge on that contingency tended to focus on\nthe challenge God\u2019s foreknowledge of future events posed to the\ncontingency of events.\n\nIn his commentary on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences, Holkot\nput forward an elaborate argument:\n\nIf a is a sin that Socrates will freely commit tomorrow.\n\n\nThen it is argued: God knows that a will be, therefore from\neternity He knew that a will be or he began to know that\na will be.\n\nIt cannot be said that He began to know that a will be,\nbecause then He could know or foreknow something anew and as a result\nof time. . . .\n\nIf He knew a from eternity, I pose that \u201ca\nwill be\u201d was written on a wall yesterday. Therefore, the\nproposition \u201cthat written on the wall was true\u201d is true,\nand . . . consequently necessary because it is a true proposition\nabout the past. Therefore, it is necessary that it be the case as the\nproposition denotes, i. e., it is necessary that Socrates sin.\n(Sent. II, q. 2, in Seeing the Future, 126,\nll. 307\u2013317)\n\n\nHolkot contended that the common response of his era to such an\nargument, was to pose the possibility of a counterfactual past: to say\nthat the proposition \u201ca will be\u201d is true, yet\ncontingently true, and therefore, although it is true, it can never\nhave been true. Holkot argued, the possibility of a counterfactual\npast differentiated propositions about the future on contingent\nmatters and their equivalents--whether set in the past or\npresent--from propositions about the past and present that are not\nabout such contingent matters. The propositions \u201ca was\nknown by God,\u201d and \u201ca is known by God,\u201d\nalthough set in the past and present, are true and yet can never have\nbeen true, just like other propositions about the future, because they\nare about a, and a, as a future contingent, may\nstill not happen. Holkot\u2019s response is recognizable as a version\nof what in modern discussions is called the Ockhamist solution,\nalthough the argument traces back at least to Bonaventure (Slotemaker\nand Witt 2015, 87\u201394).\n",
