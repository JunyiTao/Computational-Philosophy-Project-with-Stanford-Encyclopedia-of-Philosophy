Hilbert\u2019s Foundations of Geometry\n\nHilbert\u2019s work in Foundations of Geometry (hereafter\nreferred to as \u201cFG\u201d) consists primarily of laying out a\nclear and precise set of axioms for Euclidean geometry, and of\ndemonstrating in detail the relations of those axioms to one another\nand to some of the fundamental theorems of geometry. In particular,\nHilbert demonstrates the consistency of various sub-groups of the\naxioms, the independence of a number of axioms from others, and\nvarious relations of provability and of independence of important\ntheorems from specific sub-groups of the axioms. Included are new\ndemonstrations of the consistency of the entire set of axioms for\nEuclidean geometry, and of the independence of the axiom of parallels\nfrom the other Euclidean axioms.\n\nThe notion of \u201cindependence\u201d at issue here is that of\nnon-provability: to say that a given statement is independent\nof a collection of statements is to say that it is not provable\nfrom them, or equivalently that the collection does not logically\nentail that statement. Consistency, too, is understood in terms of\nprovability: to say that a collection of statements is consistent is\nto say that no contradiction is provable from it. Hence the two\nnotions, consistency and independence, are inter-definable: a set of\nstatements is consistent if an arbitrarily-chosen contradiction is\nindependent of it, and a statement S is independent of a set\nC if the set \\(C \\cup {\\sim}S\\) is consistent.\n\nHilbert\u2019s consistency demonstrations in FG are all\ndemonstrations of relative consistency, which is to say that\nin each case the consistency of a set AX of geometric axioms is\nreduced to that of a familiar background theory B,\ndemonstrating that AX is consistent if B is. The\nimportant technique Hilbert employs is the reinterpretation\nof the geometric terms appearing in AX in such a way that, as\nreinterpreted, the members of AX express theorems of B.\nFor example, Hilbert\u2019s first consistency-proof interprets the\nterms \u201cpoint\u201d, \u201cline\u201d, and \u201clies\non\u201d as standing respectively for a particular collection of\nordered pairs of real numbers, for a collection of ratios of real\nnumbers, and for an algebraically-defined relation between such pairs\nand ratios; under this reinterpretation, the geometric sentences in\nquestion express theorems of the background theory of real\nnumbers.\n\nThat such a reinterpretation strategy guarantees relative consistency\ncan be seen via the following reasoning: If the set AX were\ninconsistent, then it would logically imply a contradiction. But as\nlogical implication is independent of the specific meanings of such\nterms as \u201cpoint\u201d and \u201cline\u201d, AX would\ncontinue to imply a contradiction under its reinterpretation. But that\nis just to say that a set of theorems of B would imply a\ncontradiction, hence that B itself would be inconsistent.\n\nIndependence is demonstrated in exactly the same way. To show that a\nstatement I is independent of a set AX of statements\n(relative to the consistency of B), one interprets the relevant\ngeometric terms in such a way that the members of AX, as\ninterpreted, express theorems of B, while I expresses\nthe negation of a theorem of B. That is, the independence of\nI from AX (relative to the consistency of B) is\ndemonstrated by proving the consistency of \\(\\textit{AX} \\cup\n\\{{\\sim}I\\}\\) relative to that of B.\n\nThe general idea of using interpretation to prove consistency was not\nnovel in FG; similar strategies had been recently applied in various\nmathematical schools to show consistency and independence in\narithmetic and in class theory, as well as\n geometry.[2]\n The technique also has antecedents in the earlier use of geometric\nmodels to prove the consistency of non-Euclidean geometries.\n [3]\n Hilbert\u2019s work in FG brings however a significant advance in\nterms of the clarity and systematic application of the technique, and\nan influential account of the nature of the metatheoretic reasoning\ninvolved in demonstrating consistency and independence via\nreinterpretation. Once Hilbert\u2019s technique is applied to the\nsentences of a fully formalized language, a development that took\nplace in stages over the three decades following FG, we obtain\nessentially the modern understanding of models, whose use today in\ndemonstrations of consistency and independence differs only in detail\nfrom that of Hilbert\u2019s\n technique.[4]\n\nHilbert\u2019s central idea, again, is to focus not on particular\ngeometrical concepts like point and line, but to pay\nattention instead to the logical relations that are said, by the\naxioms, to hold between those concepts. The question of the\nindependence of the parallels axiom from the other Euclidean axioms\nhas entirely to do with the logical structure exhibited by these\naxioms, and nothing to do with whether it is geometric points\nand lines one is talking about, or some other subject-matter\naltogether. As Hilbert says,\n\n\n[I]t is surely obvious that every theory is only a scaffolding or\nschema of concepts together with their necessary relations to one\nanother, and that the basic elements can be thought of in any way one\nlikes. If in speaking of my points I think of some system of things,\ne.g., the system: love, law, chimney-sweep \u2026 and then assume\nall my axioms as relations between these things, then my propositions,\ne.g., Pythagoras\u2019 theorem, are also valid for these things. In\nother words: any theory can always be applied to infinitely many\nsystems of basic elements. (Letter to Frege of December 29, 1899, as\nexcerpted by Frege [ellipsis Hilbert\u2019s or Frege\u2019s] in\nFrege 1980: 40)\n\n\nThis understanding of the geometric terms as susceptible of multiple\ninterpretations enables one to see the geometric sentences themselves,\nand sets of them, as providing definitions of a certain kind,\na kind typically referred to as \u201cimplicit definition\u201d.\nSpecifically: A set AX of sentences containing n\nreinterpretable terms implicitly defines an n-place relation\n\\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) holding of just those n-tuples which, when\ntaken respectively as the interpretations of AX\u2019s\nreinterpretable terms, render the members of AX true. (For\nexample: if AX is the set {There are at least two\npoints; Every point lies on at least two\nlines}, then \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) is the relation that holds\nof any triple \\(\\langle P, \\textit{LO}, L\\rangle\\) such that P\nhas at least two members, L has at least two members, and\nLO is a relation that holds between each member of P and\nat least two members of L.) The defined relation is simply the\nabstract structure, or as Hilbert puts it the\n\u201cscaffolding\u201d, shared by any such\n n-tuple.[5]\n\n\nWhen a set of sentences provides an implicit definition of a relation,\none can ask whether that relation (and, by extension, the set of\nsentences itself) is satisfiable. That is, one can ask\nwhether there is an n-tuple which, when serving as the\ninterpretation of the relevant terms in the sentences, will make each\nsentence true. Each of Hilbert\u2019s consistency-demonstrations in\nFG provides an n-tuple that satisfies the relevant defined\nrelation, and hence provides a proof of the satisfiability of that\nrelation. Satisfiability in this sense is sufficient for consistency,\nvia the reasoning given\n above.[6]\n\n\nWe can now redescribe Hilbert\u2019s technique, in a nutshell, as\nfollows: Given a set AX of sentences, Hilbert appeals to a\nbackground theory B to construct an interpretation of\nAX\u2019s geometric terms under which the members of AX\nexpress theorems of B. This interpretation is, assuming the\nconsistency of B, an n-tuple satisfying the relation\n\\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) defined by AX. Its existence demonstrates\nthe satisfiability of \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) and consequently the\nconsistency of AX relative to that of B. Similarly for\nthe independence of I from AX. \n",
