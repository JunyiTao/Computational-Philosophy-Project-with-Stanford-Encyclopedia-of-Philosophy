    "main_text": "Mind and Metaphysics || Phenomenalism\n6.5 Phenomenalism\n\n\nSomething analogous to a phenomenalist stance is adopted by the \nSautr\u0101ntikas. In the commentary portion to the \nTreasury of Higher Knowledge Vasubandhu, arguing from the\nperspective of the Sautr\u0101ntikas, provides a phenomenalist account\nof experience. On this view, form does not refer to the material\naspect of an independently existing entity but rather to how it is\nphenomenally disclosed in perception. Form is thus defined as\nsomething that can either be disrupted by impact or as something that\nopposes resistance (pratigh\u0101ta). However, these\nproperties do not extend to the atoms themselves, which form the\nbuilding blocks of materiality. Although as monadic units the atoms\nare seen as devoid of any formal properties, as atomic compounds\n(sa\u1e43gh\u0101tastha, sa\u1e43cita) the atoms\nare subject to the same properties of resistance and destruction as\nany other material entities.\n\n\nThe difficulty of reconciling atomism\u2014a fundamental tenet of \nBuddhist metaphysics\u2014with the phenomenology of perception is \napparent in early Abhidharma debates between Realists (chiefly the \nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas) and the Phenomenalists (the \nSautr\u0101ntikas). The debate between the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas and\nthe Sautr\u0101ntikas on the issue of whether the sensible qualities \nof objects (viz., color, shape, etc.) supervene on the atoms is a \ntelling point. For the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, secondary properties \nsuch as color (var\u1e47a) are in fact substances \n(dravya) similar to the four great elements. For the \nSautr\u0101ntikas, color is a derived property that lacks the \nelemental nature of primary dharmas like fire, water, etc. \nRather, secondary properties are treated by the Sautr\u0101ntikas as \npotentialities that reside in aggregated entities. Moreover, the \nSautr\u0101ntikas conceive of atoms not as substantial impartite \nentities, but rather as the most subtle collection of material \nelements (see AKBh ad II, 22ab).\n\n\nOn this Sautr\u0101ntika view, as presented by Vasubandhu, perceived \nmaterial properties, both primary (e.g., solidity) and secondary \n(e.g., color) are in fact emergent properties of subtle collections \nof elements whose phenomenal properties reflect the constitution and \nfunction of the perceptual systems. For instance, fluidity in the \ncase of water may be classified both as a primary property of water \natoms and also as a secondary property reflecting a specific \nconfiguration of water atoms. The same atoms of water, when \nconfigured as ice, may produce the sensation of hardness instead of \nthat of fluidity.\n\n\nA phenomenal object is such that it affects an individual by \noccasioning different types of experience. For example, water causes \nthe experience of wetness and fluidity, rocks the experience of \nresistance or hardness, irregular surfaces the experience of \nroughness, etc. The material aspect of the experienced object as \nexperienced, although arising in dependence upon the activity of\nthe corresponding sense sphere, at the same time obstructs and limits\nit: a wall limits movement, night restricts vision, etc. This is the \ntypical phenomenological stance: physical entities are mind \nindependent, but we have no way of knowing how they are in themselves\napart from the way we perceive and conceive them. \n\n\nAn often quoted passage from the Abhidharma literature reads: \n\u201cOne sees the blue, but one does not see \u2018it is \n blue\u2019.\u201d[3]\n This statement captures an essential aspect of Buddhist \nphenomenalism: indirect perception, rather than providing a \ndefinitive picture of the content of non-conceptual awareness, \ninstead distorts and misrepresents this content. The Buddhist \npreoccupation with the pure datum of experience is in large measure \nmotivated by a deep suspicion of \u201cany sort of theorizing about \nthe world that we experience\u201d (Matilal 1986, 315). This is one \nof the main reasons why philosophers of the logico-epistemological \ntradition invite us to go beyond our ordinary language intuitions.\n",
