    "main_text": "Moral Science\n2. Moral Science\n\nIn his \u201cPreface\u201d to the 2nd edition of his Sermons Butler\nsketched his vision of \u201cMorals, considered as a Science,\u201d\n(\u201cPreface,\u201d \u00a76) \u2014 i.e. speculative moral\nphilosophy in need of defense from speculative objections as opposed\nto practical moral counsel or revealed religion. Morals considered as\na science proceeds either from abstract relations of things or from\nmatters of fact (\u201cPreface,\u201d \u00a712). Clarke and William\nWollaston were influential philosophers who argued primarily from\nabstract relations to moral obligations, duties, virtues, etc. in\ntheir moral systems. Clarke in particular had argued that we have a\npriori access to the eternal \u201cfitnesses\u201d of things through\ncertain, abstract, and necessary quasi-mathematical arguments (Clarke\n1706) that entail necessary moral obligations and duties insofar as\nactions accord with or fail to accord with eternal and immutable\nrealities. In his correspondence with Clarke, the young Butler noted\nhis discovery of a new method for establishing truths in morals\n(Butler/Clarke 1716, \u00a71). Although the correspondence took place\na few years before Butler delivered the Sermons, it seems likely that\nthe method he alluded to in the correspondence was the nascent method\nthat he would deploy in the first three sermons (which Butler stressed\nwere argued strictly from matters of fact) (\u201cPreface\u201d\n\u00a713).\n\nButler had little doubt that arguments from abstract relations and\narguments from matters of fact were complementary, but he held that\nthe latter had major advantages over the former as a method in ethics.\nFirst it was in \u201ca peculiar Manner adapted to satisfie a fair\nMind; and is more easily applicable to the several particular\nRelations and Circumstances in Life\u201d (\u201cPreface,\u201d\n\u00a712). In other words, arguments from matters of fact allowed us\nto discern moral standards in human actions and for the standards to\nbe accessible to and motivating for ordinary reflecting agents (to be\ndiscussed in 3.). Whereas the abstract relations of things might\nestablish for Clarke or Wollaston that \u201cVice is contrary to the\nNature and Reasons of Things\u201d (\u201cPreface,\u201d \u00a712),\narguments of matter of fact established that vice is \u201ca\nviolation or breaking in upon our own Nature,\u201d\n(\u201cPreface,\u201d \u00a712). These fitnesses or proportions were\nto be discovered in our nature and although they might be consistent\nwith a priori metaphysical relations, the norms and values that they\ndetermined were obliging and motivating in absence of access to said\nrelations. As such they were relativized to human nature,\nauthoritative for it, and accessible via reflection on and observation\nof our actions and those of others\n\nBut one might still worry that moral judgments that rested on probable\nmatters of fact were less secure than those found to be in accordance\nwith eternal fitnesses, even with the aforementioned advantages. Seven\nyears later, Butler offered a methodological argument in the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to the Analogy that might respond\nto this objection if applied to morals (although Butler framed the\npoint more generally). Although deductive arguments like those\nchampioned by Clarke were secure when considered abstractly, they were\nopen to doubt when applied to matters of fact about actions or\ncharacters. This was because one needed a hypothesis of how to apply\nthe abstract demonstrative truths to observed facts\n(\u201cIntroduction\u201d \u00a77) \u2014 how to fit the fitnesses\nto actions so to speak \u2014 and this hypothesis itself was not\ndeductively secure. Butler offered the analogy of Cartesian\nphysiology. Cartesian physiology applies Cartesian geometry to living\nbodies. But one needs a probable hypothesis to move from the abstract\ntruths of Cartesian geometry to actual bodies and diseases. For\nexample, \u201cthis spleen is roughly an oval and the way it\ninteracts with the liver roughly results in this sort of\nmechanism.\u201d The mechanism itself as represented abstractly is a\ncertain geometrical relationship. But in order to apply the mechanism\nto blood and guts, one needs to have a probable, i.e. not certain,\nhypothesis about how the ideal mechanism fits with the facts on the\nground \u2014 that this arrangement of blood and guts is best\ncaptured by this mechanism not that one. A similar problem arises when\napplying eternal and abstract relations to particular moral\ncircumstances and actions. The need for a hypothesis as to how the\nrelations might fit actual actions rendered the evaluation of the\naction merely probable even though the rightness and wrongness to\nwhich the action was to conform \u2014 the eternal fitness \u2014\nwas known certainly.\n\nSince both Clarke\u2019s method and Butler\u2019s method were\nprobable, Clarke\u2019s probable in application to actions and\nButler\u2019s in relying on matters of fact about human nature in\nestablishing facts about vice and virtue, one might conclude\nskeptically that both failed. But Butler argued that a probable course\nof action could still be morally obligatory. He claimed that probable\nreasoning could result in sufficient certainty for moral action when\nan action could be shown to be more probably good than either inaction\nor an opposed action. Lacking further evidence the more probably good\naction is morally obligatory. This suggested a way in which probable\nevidence, for example probable evidence for the existence of an\nafterlife, could be obliging on us and was crucial to his arguments\nfor the reasonableness of basic Christian teachings in the\nAnalogy.\n",
