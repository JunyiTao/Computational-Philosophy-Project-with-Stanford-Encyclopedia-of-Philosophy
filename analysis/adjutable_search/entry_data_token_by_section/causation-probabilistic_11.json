    "main_text": "Probability-raising Theories of Causation || Simpson\u2019s Paradox and Background Contexts\n2.4 Simpson\u2019s Paradox and Background Contexts\n\nIn the Reichenbach-Suppes definition of causation, the inequality\n\\(\\PP(E_{t'} \\mid C_t) \\gt \\PP(E_{t'} \\mid {\\nsim}C_t)\\) is\nnecessary, but not sufficient, for causation. It is not sufficient,\nbecause it may hold in cases where \\(C_t\\) and \\(E_{t'}\\) share a\ncommon cause. Unfortunately, common causes can also give rise to cases\nwhere this inequality is not necessary for causation either. Suppose,\nfor example, that smoking is highly correlated with living in the\ncountry: those who live in the country are much more likely to smoke\nas well. Smoking is a cause of lung cancer, but suppose that city\npollution is an even stronger cause of lung cancer. Then it may be\nthat smokers are, over all, less likely to suffer from lung cancer\nthan non-smokers. Letting C represent smoking, B living\nin the country, and E lung cancer, \\(\\PP(E \\mid C) \\lt\n\\PP(E \\mid {\\nsim}C)\\). Note, however, that if we conditionalize\non whether one lives in the country or in the city, this inequality is\nreversed: \\(\\PP(E \\mid C \\amp B) \\gt \\PP(E \\mid {\\nsim}C \\amp\nB)\\), and \\(\\PP(E \\mid C \\amp{\\nsim}B) \\gt \\PP(E \\mid {\\nsim}C\n\\amp{\\nsim}B)\\). Such reversals of probabilistic inequalities are\ninstances of \u201cSimpson\u2019s Paradox\u201d. The problem that\nSimpson\u2019s paradox creates for probabilistic theories of\ncausation was pointed out by Nancy Cartwright (1979) and Brian Skyrms\n(1980) at about the same time.\n\nCartwright and Skyrms sought to rectify the problem by replacing\nconditions (ii) and (iii) of\n Reich\n with the requirement that causes must raise the probabilities of\ntheir effects in various background contexts. Cartwright\nproposed the following definition:\n\n(Cart)\nC causes E if and only if \n  \\(\\PP(E \\mid C \\amp B) \\gt \\PP(E \\mid {\\nsim}C \\amp B)\\) \n  for every background context B.\n\n\nSkyrms proposed a slightly weaker condition: a cause must raise the\nprobability of its effect in at least one background context, and\nlower it in none. A background context is a conjunction of factors.\nWhen such a conjunction of factors is conditioned on, those factors\nare said to be \u201cheld fixed\u201d. To specify what the\nbackground contexts will be, then, we must specify what factors are to\nbe held fixed. In the previous example, we saw that the true causal\nrelevance of smoking for lung cancer was revealed when we held country\nliving fixed, either positively (conditioning on \\(B)\\) or negatively\n(conditioning on \\({\\nsim}B)\\). This suggests that in evaluating the\ncausal relevance of C for E, we need to hold fixed other\ncauses of E, either positively or negatively. This suggestion\nis not entirely correct, however. Let C and E be smoking\nand lung cancer, respectively. Suppose D is a causal\nintermediary, say the presence of tar in the lungs. If C causes\nE exclusively via D, then D will screen C\noff from E: given the presence (absence) of tar in the lungs,\nthe probability of lung cancer is not affected by whether the tar got\nthere by smoking. Thus we will not want to hold fixed any causes of\nE that are themselves caused by C. Let us call the set\nof all factors that are causes of E, but are not caused by\nC, the set of independent causes of E. A\nbackground context for C and E will then be a maximal\nconjunction, each of whose conjuncts is either an independent cause of\nE, or the negation of an independent cause of E.\n\nNote that the specification of factors that need to be held fixed\nappeals to causal relations, so the theory no longer offers a\nreductive analysis of causation. Nonetheless, the theory\nimposes probabilistic constraints upon possible causal relations in\nthe sense that a given set of probability relations will be\nincompatible with at least some systems of causal relations. Note also\nthat we have dropped the subscripts referring to times. Cartwright\nclaimed that it is not necessary to appeal to the time order of events\nto distinguish causes from effects in her theory. That is because it\nwill no longer be true in general that if C raises the\nprobability of E in every relevant background context B,\nthen E raise will raise the probability of C in every\nbackground context \\(B'\\). The reason is that the construction of the\nbackground contexts ensures that the background contexts relevant to\nassessing C\u2019s causal relevance for E are different\nfrom those relevant to assessing E\u2019s causal relevance for\nC. However, Davis (1988) and Eells (1991) both argue cogently\nthat Cartwright\u2019s account will still sometimes rule that effects\nbring about their causes.\n",
