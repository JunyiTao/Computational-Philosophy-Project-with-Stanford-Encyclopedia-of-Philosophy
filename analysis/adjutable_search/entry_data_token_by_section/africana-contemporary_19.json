    "main_text": "Reading the contemporary\u2014evolving themes || Black life and social death\n8. Conclusion\n\nTo discuss studies of black life and social death in the context of\nthis entry is to return to one of the recurring tensions in the field\nof Africana philosophy. It is a field not just born of struggle but\nalso emerging from the crucible of racialization. Africana philosophy\nis importantly related but not reducible to a responsible\nphilosophical race theory: it is a constellation of views, approaches,\ntraditions, problems, debates, and figures that owes its existence as\na somewhat unitary enterprise at least in part to the practices of\nrace-making, but that reaches deeper into the lives of particular\ncommunities than race theory can, with results\u2014like studies of\nthe Yoruba conception of peace\u2014that in no way depend on\nrace-theoretic analysis for their import.\n\nThis study of course leaves out much more than it includes. There is,\nfor example, nothing here about Nkiru Nzegwu\u2019s innovative\ninstitution-building efforts with the International Society for\nAfrican Philosophy and Studies\n (ISAPS)[17]\n and the Africa Knowledge Project, or about Sylvia Wynter\u2019s\nimpactful interventions in decolonial and Afro-Caribbean\n philosophy.[18]\n Nor will there be space to explore Achille Mbembe\u2019s studies of\nnecropolitics, George Yancy\u2019s remarkable reinvention of critical\nphenomenology, the long shadow of Molefi Asante\u2019s Africology,\nthe innovations of Tommy Curry\u2019s Black male studies, Anita\nAllen-Castellitto\u2019s insightful studies of privacy and her\neloquent commentaries on the profession, or the dynamic Afro-futurism\nof figures from Sun-Ra to Janelle Monae.\n\nSilences and oversights are inevitable in a short study of a sprawling\nconstellation of related areas of inquiry. For that reason it is\nfitting to end with language from Outlaw\u2019s version of a similar\nstudy. One might say of this entry what Outlaw says of his: that it\n\u201cis not meant to be exhaustive,\u201d but instead\n\u201cprovides examples and solicits additional contributions in\norder to make the account more comprehensive and accurate\u201d\n(Outlaw 2017, \u00a72, par. 23).\n",
