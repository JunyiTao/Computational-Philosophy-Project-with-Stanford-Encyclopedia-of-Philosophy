Externalism\n\nWhatever one might conclude as to whether moral judgments or beliefs\nmotivate on their own or only by means of some preexisting conative\nstate, a question remains as to the precise nature of the connection\nbetween moral judgment and motivation. Do moral judgments motivate\nnecessarily or do they motivate only contingently?\nIf the latter, then how are we to explain why the contingent\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation is as strong and\nreliable as it appears to be?\n\nThe main division of opinion regarding the nature of the connection\nbetween moral judgment and motivation is between those philosophers\nwho accept and those who reject a thesis known as motivational\njudgment internalism. This thesis is a form of judgment\ninternalism. Traditionally, judgment internalism has been\ncharacterized as claiming either that motivation is internal to moral\njudgment, in the sense that moral judgment itself motivates without\nneed of an accompanying desire (\u201cstrong internalism\u201d) or\nthat there is a necessary connection between moral judgment and\nmotivation (\u201cweak internalism\u201d). As currently\ncharacterized in the literature, judgment internalism makes the\nconceptual claim that a necessary connection exists between sincere\nmoral judgment and either justifying reasons or motives: necessarily,\nif an individual sincerely judges that she ought to \u03c6, then she\nhas a reason or motive to \u03c6. Judgment internalism must be\ndistinguished from the thesis of existence internalism, which we\nconsidered earlier. Recall that according to existence\ninternalism, a necessary connection exists between having a certain\nnormative status and\n motivation.[7]\n A consideration can be a reason or be right-making,\nfor example, only if it is capable of motivating. Whereas judgment\ninternalism states a necessary condition on being a judgment of a\ncertain kind, existence internalism states a necessary condition on\nbeing an act or state or consideration of a certain normative\nkind.\n\nMotivational judgment internalism, hereafter\n\u201cinternalism,\u201d holds that a person cannot sincerely make a\nmoral judgment without being motivated at least to some\ndegree to abide by her judgment. Internalism can assume weaker or\nstronger forms. On Mackie\u2019s account of Plato, is it the view\nthat necessarily a person who makes a sincere moral judgment will be\noverridingly motivated to comply with her judgment. Thus,\nwhat objective moral properties must be like involves a rather extreme\nform of existence internalism, which would be allied with a rather\nextreme form of judgment internalism. Contemporary moral philosophers\nhave been no more attracted to so strong a claim when moral motivation\nis tied to moral judgment than they have been when moral motivation is\ntied to moral properties. Instead, they have accepted weaker forms of\ninternalism, which allow that even though, necessarily, the person who\nmakes a sincere moral judgment will feel some motivation to\ncomply with it, that motivation can be overridden by conflicting\ndesires and defeated by a variety of mental maladies, such as\ndepression and weakness of will (Svavarsdottir 1999, sec.1). \n\nAs should already be evident, those who accept one or another form of\nmotivational judgment internalism have a ready explanation of the\nreliability of moral motivation, including the reliability of\nmotivational shifting so as to track changes in moral judgment.\nIndeed, one argument offered in favor of internalism is that only if\nwe accept it can we plausibly explain why changes in moral motivation\nreliably follow upon changes in moral judgment (Smith 1994,\n71\u201376). Suppose Jones and Thomson are debating the moral\npermissibility of abortion. Jones is inclined to believe that abortion\nis morally wrong. She has been known to join the protest line outside\nof a local abortion clinic and to try to dissuade women from having\nabortions. Thomson, in contrast, believes that abortion is morally\npermissible. Suppose that after extensive discussion, Thomson\nconvinces Jones that the more plausible arguments support the\npermissibility of abortion. What would people reasonably predict in\nterms of Jones\u2019s future conduct? They would reasonably predict,\namong other things, that she would no longer be inclined to join the\nprotest line and that she would desist from her efforts to discourage\nother women from having abortions. But that prediction rests precisely\non the expectation that, at least insofar as Jones is a good and\nstrong-willed person\u2014not depressed or apathetic or suffering\nfrom weakness of will\u2014what she is motivated to do will have been\naltered in response to the change in her moral judgment, which is just\nwhat internalism would lead us to expect. If internalism is true,\nthen, we can readily account for motivational changes. The reliable\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation is, ultimately, best\nexplained internally as due to the very content or nature of moral\njudgment itself (Smith 1994, 72). Those who accept internalism will,\nof course, ultimately owe us an account of the nature of moral\njudgments that explains and captures the necessary connection that\nsupposedly exists between moral judgment and\n motivation.[8]\n\nThe thesis that directly opposes motivational judgment internalism,\nmotivational externalism, or just externalism,\ndenies that it is a conceptual platitude that necessarily moral\njudgments motivate. According to externalism, any connection that\nexists between moral judgment and motivation is purely contingent,\nthough it may turn out to rest on deep features of human\n nature.[9]\n Moral motivation occurs when a moral judgment combines with a desire,\nand the content of the judgment is related to the content of the\ndesire so as to rationalize the action. The foregoing argument in\nfavor of internalism in effect denies that externalism can adequately\nexplain the basic phenomenon of moral motivation and, in particular,\nthe seemingly reliable shifting of moral motivation to match changes\nin moral judgment. But why think externalism will be explanatorily\ninadequate? Once we have the internalist thesis about the necessary\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation, it seems we have, as\nit were, the whole story: if an individual makes a moral judgment, she\nis, ceteris paribus, motivated; if she is not motivated, she\nwas not making a sincere and competent moral judgment at all,\nappearances to the contrary notwithstanding. Because the externalist\ndenies the existence of a necessary connection between moral judgment\nand motivation, the externalist thesis leaves us in need of an\nindependent explanation of moral motivation. The internalist maintains\nthat any such explanation will fall short\u2014call this the\n\u201cinternist challenge\u201d to externalism.\n\nAccording to one important version of the internalist challenge,\noffered by Michael Smith, the externalist would have to explain the\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation externally\nas due not to the content of moral judgments but, rather, the\n\u201ccontent of the motivational dispositions possessed by the good\nand strong-willed person\u201d (Smith 1994, 72). But this allegedly\ncommits the externalist to an unacceptable picture of moral\nmotivation. The internalist will say that an agent who is moved to do\nthe right thing is moved to do the very thing that is given by the\ncontent of her moral judgment; she is motivated to do the very thing\nshe judges to be right (73). The person who judges it right to perform\nan act that advances another\u2019s welfare, for example, acquires\nand is moved by a non-derivative desire or concern to advance his\nwelfare. In contrast, the externalist must say that an agent is moved\nto do what she judges right due to the content of the motivational\ndispositions that she has in being a good person. The question then is\nwhat those dispositions might be. Recall that when a person\u2019s\njudgment changes, her motivation tends to change. If such motivational\nshifting is to be explained in terms of the motivational dispositions\nof the good person, rather than in terms of the content of her moral\njudgments, then the only disposition that could do the explaining\nwould be the motivation to do the right thing, whatever it\nhappens to be (75). According to Smith, such a view implausibly treats\nmoral motivation as derivative; it derives from the desire to do the\nright thing together with a person\u2019s current moral judgment\nabout the right thing to do. A person desires to promote\nanother\u2019s good, not non-derivatively because she judges\nit right to promote his good and so desires to do just that, but\nbecause she desires to do what is right, and that just happens to be\npromoting his good. But the good person, Smith claims, cares\nnon-derivatively about justice, equality, and the welfare of\nloved ones. To care non-derivatively only about doing what one\nbelieves right, to be motivated in that way, and not by these other\nthings, is \u201ca fetish or moral vice\u201d (75). Smith suggests\nthat in taking the good person to be motivated to do what she believes\nmorally right, whatever that might be, the externalist picture\n\u201calienates her from the ends at which morality properly\naims\u201d (76).\n\nExternalists have responded to this challenge by pointing out that the\nfact that a good person is motivated to do what she thinks right does\nnot preclude her from also being motivated non-derivately by direct\nconcern, for example, for the welfare of loved ones. They have also\nargued that there is nothing fetishistic in supposing that the good\nperson is motivationally disposed to do the right thing and that, in\nany case, alternative externalist explanations of a reliable\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation are available (Copp\n1997, 49\u201350). An individual could, for example, simply be\ndisposed to desire immediately to do whatever she believes it right to\ndo or whatever she judges to be valuable, rather than being disposed\nto do the right thing, whatever it turns out to be (Copp 1997,\n50\u201351). Sigrun Svavarsdottir (1999) has argued that Smith is\nmistaken when he claims that the externalist\u2019s only option for\nexplaining motivational shifting is to appeal to a desire to do the\nright thing, but she thinks that something close to the view Smith\nrejects provides just the right externalist picture of moral\nmotivation. We should, on her view, understand the good person as\nconcerned with doing what is morally valuable or required, where that\nconcern should be understood to encompass what is honest, fair, kind,\nconsiderate, just, and so on. The fact that the good person is so\nmotivationally disposed does not mean, as Smith seems to suggest, that\nshe cares only about one thing, namely, doing what she believes is\nright. Nor does it mean that she undertakes an act conceiving of it\nsimply as the right thing to do. On the contrary, it is compatible\nwith the externalist picture that the good person will often simply\nrespond directly to another\u2019s need for comfort or relief.\nMoreover, an externalist view that conceives of the good person as\nmotivated by the desire to be moral does not involve introducing an\nalien (or alienating) thought\u2014\u201cit\u2019s the right thing\nto do\u201d\u2014 into her consciousness in order to explain moral\nmotivation. Rather, having formed the moral judgment that she ought to\n\u03c6, the desire to be moral plays, in the good person, a role in\neffecting the \u201cpsychological transition\u201d from judging it\nright to \u03c6 to wanting to \u03c6 (Svavarsdottir 1999, 201). Finally,\nSvavarsdottir argues that although a desire to do the morally right\naction, say, aid another in need, may derive at first from a desire to\nbe moral, it may come to operate independently of the latter desire,\nso that her desire to aid is not simply an instrumental desire\n(Svavarsdottir 1999, 205\u2013206, 213\u2013214).\n\nIndeed, the point on which externalists want to insist is that some\nconative state must be at work in the movement from judging it right\nto \u03c6 to wanting or being moved to \u03c6. After all, the\nexternalist will remind us, this movement does not occur in\nall moral agents; some of them will judge it right to \u03c6\nwithout being moved to \u03c6. Externalists typically take it as a\npoint of common sense observation that wide variation exists in the\nimpact moral judgments have on people\u2019s feelings, deliberations,\nand actions (Svavarsdottir 1999, 161).\n\nDebates between internalists and externalists often center on the\nfigure of the \u201camoralist\u201d\u2014the person who apparently\nmakes moral judgments, while remaining wholly unmoved to comply with\nthem. Various efforts have been made to respond to the problem of the\namoralist, and these efforts have led to the development of numerous\nversions of motivational judgment internalism. Generally, internalists\nhave insisted that the amoralist is a conceptual impossibility. The\nstandard strategy internalists employ to cope with the hypothetical\namoralist is to identify a content for moral judgments which would\nhave the result that no agent (or no rational agent, anyway)\ncould employ moral concepts competently and make a sincere moral\njudgment, while remaining unmoved. Internalists allow that moral\nmotivation need not be overriding; competing desires may be stronger\nand so may win out. They allow, too, that moral motivation is\ndefeasible; a person may judge it right to \u03c6, while failing to be\nmoved to \u03c6, due to depression or weakness of will. Cases of\nirrationality aside, however, the person who appears to be\nmaking a moral judgment, while remaining unmoved, must really either\nlack competence with moral concepts or be speaking insincerely. In the\nlatter case, she judges an act \u201cright\u201d only in an\n\u201cinverted commas\u201d sense (R. M Hare, 1963), as when the\nunrepentant criminal, seeking a lesser sentence, tells the judge, in a\nremorseful tone, that he knows what he did was\n\u201cwrong\u201d.\n\nExternalists, of course, maintain that the amoralist is not a\nconceptual impossibility. After all, if we can conceive of\namoralists, as we surely can, then they are not conceptually\nimpossible (Shafer-Landau 2003, 146). Contrary to what internalists\nclaim, individuals can sincerely and competently apply moral concepts\nwithout being motivated in any specific way. While some amoralists may\nuse moral terms only in an inverted commas sense, not all cases of\nmotivational failure can be explained away as cases of irrationality,\nconceptual incompetence, or insincerity.\n\nAt this point in the dialectic, internalists and externalists tend to\nproduce additional arguments in an effort to overcome what seems an\nimpasse. Externalists, for example, may invite us to consider cases in\nwhich a person judges it right to \u03c6, while believing it would in\nfact be impossible to succeed in doing \u03c6, or cases in which she\nthinks doing \u03c6 would markedly interfere with her welfare or would\nprevent her from obtaining something she dearly desires. Doesn\u2019t\nit seem plausible that in such cases a person could judge it right to\n\u03c6, while failing to be moved to \u03c6? More generally,\nexternalists argue that internalists cannot make sense of\nmorality\u2019s historical challenger\u2014the skeptic who asks,\n\u201cWhy be moral?\u201d Externalists may also offer arguments\naimed at shifting the burden on to the internalist to establish that\ninternalism is a conceptual platitude (Svavarsdottir 1999, 2006).\n\nIn order more fully to address the variety of cases in which the\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation fails, internalists\nhave offered more qualified versions of internalism. These more\nqualified versions of internalism maintain that the necessary\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation holds only under\ncertain conditions. As for what these conditions are, a variety of\nviews have been advanced. For example, Smith (1994) has advanced a\nversion of internalism, or what he calls the \u201cpracticality\nrequirement,\u201d maintaining that a necessary connection holds\nbetween moral judgment and motivation, at least in the \u201cgood and\nstrong-willed person.\u201d The connection between moral judgment and\nmotivation holds, he claims, in the person who is \u201cpractically\nrational.\u201d Others have suggested that it holds in the person who\nis \u201cpsychologically normal\u201d (Dreier 1990) or in the person\nwho is \u201cmorally perceptive\u201d (Bjorklund et al. 2012:\n126-128).\n\nBut problems remain. What about the person who made a certain moral\njudgment in the past and had always been moved to act in accordance\nwith that judgment but who ceases to be motivated, while continuing to\nmake the judgment? Perhaps she judges that she morally ought to work\nactively to aid the sick and poor. After 20 years of doing so, she\nconcludes that she has done enough and ceases to be motivated to act\non her judgment, yet she continues to judge that she morally ought to\nwork actively to aid the sick and poor. Doesn\u2019t it seem\nplausible that she is competent with the moral concepts, that she\nspeaks sincerely, that she uses moral terms in their ordinary sense,\nrather than an \u201cinverted commas\u201d sense? Yet she need not\nbe apathetic or depressed or otherwise mentally ill.\n\nCases like these have led some to move away from the idea that the\nnecessary connection between moral judgment and motivation holds with\nrespect to each individual moral judgment. Those who advance forms of\nwhat Bjorklund et al. (2012) (see also Bjornsson et al. 2015) call\n\u201cdeferred internalism\u201d hold that the necessary connection\nbetween moral judgment and motivation can be more attenuated.\n\nDeferred internalism:\n\nNecessarily if a person judges that she morally ought to \u03c6, then\nshe is either (at least somewhat) motivated to \u03c6 or some\nrelevantly connected moral judgments are accompanied by motivation.\n(Bjorklund et al. 2012: 128)\n\n\nSo, in the example above, our aid worker who has ceased to be\nmotivated but still judges that she morally ought to \u03c6 had some\nrelevantly connected moral judgments that were accompanied by\nmotivation, namely, her own past judgments. Others maintain that the\namoralist is only intelligible relative to conditions in which moral\nmotivation ordinarily holds, and this has led some to find the\nrelevantly connected moral judgments in an agent\u2019s community.\nTresan (2009a and 2009b), for example, considers the possibility of a\n\u201ccommunal\u201d version of deferred internalism, which counts\nan individual\u2019s beliefs as moral only when, in the\nbeliever\u2019s community, beliefs with that content are motivating.\n(And see Blackburn 2001, 63.)\n\nAs versions of internalism become increasingly qualified, one might be\ninclined to wonder whether there is much distinction any longer\nbetween internalism and externalism. One might be inclined to wonder\nwhether either has the edge in explaining the reliability of moral\nmotivation. And if that is the case, one might be attracted to what\nseems to be the simpler story the externalist has to tell about the\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation.\n\nExternalists maintain that they can fully and adequately account for\nthe strong but ultimately contingent connection between moral judgment\nand motivation, offering various explanations of how moral judgments\nreliably motivate. As we have seen, Svavarsdottir seeks to explain\nmoral motivation by appealing to a particular conative state, namely,\nthe desire to do what is morally valuable or required\u2014the\ndesire, in short to be moral. Peter Railton appeals to the concern\npeople generally have to be able to justify their choices and conduct\nfrom a more impartial standpoint. But he also apparently thinks that\npeople\u2019s more ordinary motives play a part; at least this is\nsuggested when he remarks that, if we really want people to take\nmorality seriously, \u201cwe should ask how we might change the ways\nwe live so that moral conduct would more regularly be rational given\nthe ends we actually have\u201d (Railton 1986a, 203). According to\nDavid Brink, externalism makes the motivational force of our moral\njudgments \u201ca matter of contingent psychological fact, depending\non both the content of people\u2019s moral views and their attitudes\nand desires\u201d (Brink 1989, 49). Still, these attitudes and\ndesires may be widely shared and rooted in central features of human\nnature. Suppose, as the philosopher David Hume maintained, that\nsympathy is a deep and widely shared feature of human psychology.\nThen, Brink observes, while it may be a contingent fact that most\npeople will have some desire to comply with what they believe morality\nrequires, it will also be a deep fact about them. \u201cMoral\nmotivation, on such a view, can be widespread and predictable, even if\nit is neither necessary, nor universal, nor overriding\u201d (Brink\n1989, 49; Boyd 1998, sec. 4.7).\n\nPhilosophers who endorse externalism commonly also endorse Humeanism,\nthough it is important to remember that many internalists, including\nmost noncognitivists and expressivists about moral judgment, also\naccept the Humean theory of motivation. Indeed, some contend that the\nbasic observation that supports externalism also lends support to the\nHumean theory: wide variation in the motivational impact of moral\njudgments suggests not only that they motivate contingently but that\nthey do so via some conative state. Still, externalists need not be\nHumeans. Shafer-Landau, who rejects both Humeanism and internalism,\nholds that moral beliefs are indeed intrinsically\nmotivating\u2014they can motivate by themselves. But contra\ninternalism, they are not necessarily motivating. Intrinsically\nmotivating beliefs may fail to motivate under conditions of extreme\nexhaustion, serious depression, or overwhelming contrary impulses\n(Shafer-Landau 2003, 147\u2013148). The fact that Shafer-Landau\ntreats the defeasibility of moral motivation under such conditions as\nsupporting a form of externalism, whereas Smith treats defeasibility\nunder like conditions as compatible with a form of internalism,\nsuggests some disagreement among philosophers as to precisely when a\nview should be classified as a form of internalism or\n externalism.[10]\n",
