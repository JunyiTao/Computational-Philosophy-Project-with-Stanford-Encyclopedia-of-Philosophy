The Semiotic Construction of Sexual Subjects\n\nIn 1949, Simone de Beauvoir famously claimed that \u201c[o]ne is not\nborn, but rather becomes, a woman\u201d (Beauvoir 1989, 267).\nContemporary pragmatist feminist and continental feminist philosophers\ngenerally agree with this claim, rejecting the notion that the\ncategory of woman (and man) and the conception of femininity (and\nmasculinity) are simply given in nature. As a result, some have\nexplored the role of social institutions\u2014such as the media, the\nwork place, and education\u2014in creating the particular type of\ngendered, sexual subject called \u201cwoman.\u201d Others have\nfocused on the inner mechanisms of this process, so to speak, asking\nhow the unconscious desires of women are constituted such that their\npsychical lives contribute to their gender and sexuality. These two\napproaches need not be seen as antithetical, however. An understanding\nof how women are constituted as sexual subjects is perhaps best\nachieved by exploring the intersection of the social\n\u201coutside\u201d and the psychical \u201cinside\u201d in the\nformation of subjectivity.\n\nTeresa De Lauretis\u2019s work takes this intersectional approach, allying\nfeminism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and film criticism to explore the\nformation of women\u2019s subjectivity and desire in relation to social and\nmaterial reality. In Alice Doesn\u2019t: Feminism, Semiotics,\nCinema (1984), de Lauretis develops the concept of experience as\na process by which the subject is semiotically and historically\nconstructed, arguing that one becomes a woman in and through the\npractice of signs in which women live. In The Practice of Love:\nLesbian Sexuality and Perverse Desire (1994), she continues her\nexploration of these issues by focusing specifically on\n\u201cperverse\u201d formations of sexuality, by which she means\nforms of sexuality that challenge normative heterosexuality and\nespecially lesbian sexuality. In each of these books, de Lauretis\ndraws on the pragmatist semiosis of Peirce to explore the dynamic\njuncture between \u201cinner\u201d and \u201couter\u201d worlds,\nprivate and public fantasies, and individual experience and social\nmeaning, especially as they construct sexual subjects.\n\nSemiotics is a term created by Peirce to \u201cdesignate[s] the\nprocess by which a culture produces signs and/or attributes meanings\nof signs\u201d (de Lauretis 1984, 167). Semiotics thus is a theory of\nhow meaning is created through processes of interpretation. These\nprocesses are so important to Peirce that he goes so far as to claim,\n\u201cmy language is the sum total of myself; for the man [sic] is\nthe thought\u201d (Peirce 2000a, 67). This is not a reduction of the\nhuman to a narrowly construed language, however. Rather, the claim is\nthat to understand who or what a person is, one must understand the\nprocesses of interpretation in which she and her various communities\nare engaged. This last point helps brings out the particularly\npragmatist aspect of Peirce\u2019s semiotics. For Peirce, the semiotic\nprocesses that constitute the individual are always grounded in\ncommunity, history, and materiality. To understand the interpretative\nconstitution of the self, one must understand the various\n\u201cexternal\u201d environments that contribute to it.\n\nAccording to de Lauretis, an important reason to turn to Peirce is\nprecisely that his theory returns body and history to the subject of\n semiosis.[3]\n For Peirce, semiosis is an unlimited process, but that does not mean\nthat it is an infinite regression of signs merely circulating back on\nthemselves. Rather, as de Lauretis explains, in their address to\nsomeone\u2014and for Peirce, because they are inherently communal,\nsigns always address someone\u2014signs create other signs that are\nthe \u201csignificate effects\u201d of the first signs. Peirce calls\nthese sign-effects \u201cinterpretants,\u201d and the particular\ntype of interpretant that interests de Lauretis is the one that Peirce\ncalls \u201clogical\u201d because it takes up or makes sense of the\nemotion and energy of the other type of interpretants. The logical\ninterpretant is a modification of a person\u2019s habits,\n\u201chabit\u201d used pragmatically by Peirce to mean a tendency or\ndisposition to a certain manner or style of acting. Thus for Peirce,\nalthough unlimited, semiosis nevertheless always results in the\ntemporary \u201cresting places\u201d of one\u2019s habits of acting and\nthinking\u2014\u201ctemporary\u201d because a person\u2019s modified\nhabits will contribute to the production of new signs, which will then\nfeed into the on-going process of meaning-creation that will yet again\nmodify subjects by producing additional habit changes. Thus on\nPeirce\u2019s account\u2014and this is of utmost importance to de\nLauretis\u2014signs have their effect in historical, bodily matter\nand are not narrowly linguistic.\n\nDe Lauretis faults Julia Kristeva for operating with just such a\nnarrow (mis)understanding of the semiotic subject (1984,\n 171).[4]\n Representing one trend of poststructuralist semiotic theory for de\nLauretis, Kristeva\u2019s approach is at once valuable because of its\npsychoanalytic appreciation of the body and the unconscious, and\nproblematic because of its narrow understanding of linguistics and\nthus its neglect of the social aspects of meaning-creation. The other\ntrend of postructuralist semiotic theory, represented by Umberto Eco,\nappreciates the social side of semiosis but omits exactly what\npsychoanalysis includes: the non-conscious elements of human\nexistence. A similar division, and thus a similar set of problems, can\nbe found between the work of Freud and Foucault, according to de\nLauretis. In his focus on sexuality, Freud offers a \u201cprivatized\nview of the internal world of the psyche\u201d while Foucault\u2019s\naccount of sexuality is \u201ceminently social\u201d (1994,\nxix\u2013xx). Thus, for de Lauretis, feminists who seek to understand\nthe semiotic creation of sexual subjects are presented with a\nproblematic choice built on an exclusive binary: either the sexual\nsubject is socially constituted but lacks a psychic interior (Eco and\nFoucault) or the sexual subject has psychic depth but lacks rich\nconnections with the world external to it (Kristeva and Freud).\n\nPeirce\u2019s advantage is that he attends to both sides of the\ninternal-external divide, furnishing \u201cthe link between semiosis\nand reality, between signification and concrete action\u201d (1984,\n175). And yet, for de Lauretis, Peirce\u2019s work is not sufficient by\nitself because it lacks a well-developed notion of the unconscious.\nThus de Lauretis\u2019s self-appointed task is to negotiate the problems\nand promises of all these approaches by means of a pragmatist\nsemiotics, creating a \u201ctheoretical overlap\u201d (1984, 168)\nbetween Kristeva\u2019s internalist and Eco\u2019s externalist semiotics, as\nwell as between Freud\u2019s privatized and Foucault\u2019s social sexual\nsubject. Put another way, de Lauretis joins Freud with\nPeirce\u2014admittedly \u201ceven stranger bedfellows than Marx and\nFreud\u201d (1984, 215 n31)\u2014to explore how the semiotic\njunction between psychic interior and social exterior produces the\nunconscious habits that create sexual subjects.\n\nIn some of her most recent work (2000), de Lauretis makes clear that\nalthough semiosis is ongoing and although the habits it produces are\nalways open to future changes, habit-change is not necessarily or\nalways for the better nor can it easily (if at all) be controlled. In\ndialogue with Vincent Colapietro (2000) on how to understand Peirce\u2019s\nlogical interpretant, de Lauretis argues that it is very difficult, if\nnot impossible, to deliberately direct the significate effects of\nsemiosis. In her view here\u2014which appears to diverge somewhat\nfrom her earlier emphasis on Foucault\u2019s concepts of self-analysis and\nself-exercise as Peircean \u201c\u2018deliberately formed,\nself-analyzing habit[s]\u2019\u201d (Peirce quoted in de Lauretis\n1994, 312)\u2014the juncture of psyche and social that takes root in\nunconscious habits is not amenable to conscious efforts to transform\nit. Rather than being deliberate and reflective, changes to habit tend\nto be random (at least from the point of rational consciousness) and\nare relentlessly subject to all sorts of deformations, compulsions,\nand other neurotic symptoms (2000, 172\u201373). The semiotic\nconstruction of sexual subjects thus can be seen as perverse not only\nin that it can defy heterosexual conventions but also in that it\nresists the efforts of self-knowledge and self-directed\ntransformation.\n",
