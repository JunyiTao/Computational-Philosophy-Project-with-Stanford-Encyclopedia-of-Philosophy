    "main_text": "The Concept of the Aesthetic || Aesthetic Objects\n2.1 Aesthetic Objects\n\nArtistic formalism is the view that the artistically relevant\nproperties of an artwork\u2014the properties in virtue of which it is\nan artwork and in virtue of which it is a good or bad one\u2014are\nformal merely, where formal properties are typically regarded as\nproperties graspable by sight or by hearing merely. Artistic formalism\nhas been taken to follow from both the immediacy and the disinterest\ntheses (Binkley 1970, 266\u2013267; Carroll 2001, 20\u201340). If\nyou take the immediacy thesis to imply the artistic irrelevance of all\nproperties whose grasping requires the use of reason, and you include\nrepresentational properties in that class, then you are apt to think\nthat the immediacy thesis implies artistic formalism. If you take the\ndisinterest thesis to imply the artistic irrelevance of all properties\ncapable of practical import, and you include representational\nproperties in that class, then you are apt to think that the\ndisinterest thesis implies artistic formalism.\n\nThis is not to suggest that the popularity enjoyed by artistic\nformalism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries owed mainly to\nits inference from the immediacy or disinterest theses. The most\ninfluential advocates of formalism during this period were\nprofessional critics, and their formalism derived, at least in part,\nfrom the artistic developments with which they were concerned. As a\ncritic Eduard Hanslick advocated for the pure music of Mozart,\nBeethoven, Schumann, and later Brahms, and against the dramatically\nimpure music of Wagner; as a theorist he urged that music has no\ncontent but \u201ctonally moving forms\u201d (Hanslick 1986, 29). As\na critic Clive Bell was an early champion of the post-Impressionists,\nespecially Cezanne; as a theorist he maintained that the formal\nproperties of painting\u2014\u201crelations and combinations of\nlines and colours\u201d\u2014alone have artistic relevance (Bell\n1958, 17\u201318). As a critic Clement Greenberg was abstract\nexpressionism\u2019s ablest defender; as a theorist he held\npainting\u2019s \u201cproper area of competence\u201d to be\nexhausted by flatness, pigment, and shape (Greenberg 1986,\n86\u201387).\n\nNot every influential defender of formalism has also been a\nprofessional critic. Monroe Beardsley, who arguably gave formalism its\nmost sophisticated articulation, was not (Beardsley 1958). Nor is Nick\nZangwill, who recently has mounted a spirited and resourceful defense\nof a moderate version of formalism (Zangwill 2001). But formalism has\nalways been sufficiently motivated by art-critical data that once\nArthur Danto made the case that the data no longer supported it, and\nperhaps never really had, formalism\u2019s heyday came to an end.\nInspired in particular by Warhol\u2019s Brillo Boxes, which\nare (more or less) perceptually indistinguishable from the\nbrand-printed cartons in which boxes of Brillo were delivered to\nsupermarkets, Danto observed that for most any artwork it is possible\nto imagine both (a) another object that is perceptually indiscernible\nfrom it but which is not an artwork, and (b) another artwork that is\nperceptually indiscernible from it but which differs in artistic\nvalue. From these observations he concluded that form alone neither\nmakes an artwork nor gives it whatever value it has (Danto 1981,\n94\u201395; Danto 1986, 30\u201331; Danto 1997, 91).\n\nBut Danto has taken the possibility of such perceptual indiscernibles\nto show the limitations not merely of form but also of aesthetics, and\nhe has done so on the grounds, apparently, that the formal and the\naesthetic are co-extensive. Regarding a urinal Duchamp once exhibited\nand a perceptual indiscernible ordinary urinal, Danto maintains\nthat\n\naesthetics could not explain why one was a work of fine art and the\nother not, since for all practical purposes they were aesthetically\nindiscernible: if one was beautiful, the other one had to be\nbeautiful, since they looked just alike. (Danto 2003, 7)\n\n\nBut the inference from the limits of the artistically formal to the\nlimits of the artistically aesthetic is presumably only as strong as\nthe inferences from the immediacy and disinterest theses to artistic\nformalism, and these are not beyond question. The inference from the\ndisinterest thesis appears to go through only if you employ a stronger\nnotion of disinterest than the one Kant understands himself to be\nemploying: Kant, it is worth recalling, regards poetry as the highest\nof the fine arts precisely because of its capacity to employ\nrepresentational content in the expression of what he calls\n\u2018aesthetic ideas\u2019 (Kant 1790, 191\u2013194; see Costello\n2008 and 2013 for extended treatment of the capacity of Kantian\naesthetics to accommodate conceptual art). The inference from the\nimmediacy thesis appears to go through only if you employ a notion of\nimmediacy stronger than the one Hume, for example, takes himself to be\ndefending when he claims (in a passage quoted in section1.1) that\n\u201cin many orders of beauty, particularly those of the fine arts,\nit is requisite to employ much reasoning, in order to feel the proper\nsentiment\u201d (Hume 1751, 173). It may be that artistic formalism\nresults if you push either of the tendencies embodied in the immediacy\nand disinterest theses to extremes. It may be that the history of\naesthetics from the 18th century to the mid-Twentieth is largely the\nhistory of pushing those two tendencies to extremes. It does not\nfollow that those tendencies must be so pushed.\n\nConsider Warhol\u2019s Brillo Boxes. Danto is right to\nmaintain that the eighteenth-century theorist of taste would not know\nhow to regard it as an artwork. But this is because the\neighteenth-century theorist of taste lives in the 18th century, and so\nwould be unable to situate that work in its twentieth-century\nart-historical context, and not because the kind of theory she holds\nforbids her from situating a work in its art-historical context. When\nHume, for instance, observes that artists address their works to\nparticular, historically-situated audiences, and that a critic\ntherefore \u201cmust place herself in the same situation as the\naudience\u201d to whom a work is addressed (Hume 1757, 239), he is\nallowing that artworks are cultural products, and that the properties\nthat works have as the cultural products they are are among the\n\u201cingredients of the composition\u201d that a critic must grasp\nif she is to feel the proper sentiment. Nor does there seem to be\nanything in the celebrated conceptuality of Brillo Boxes, nor\nof any other conceptual work, that ought to give the\neighteenth-century theorist pause. Francis Hutcheson asserts that\nmathematical and scientific theorems are objects of taste (Hutcheson\n1725, 36\u201341). Alexander Gerard asserts that scientific\ndiscoveries and philosophical theories are objects of taste (Gerard\n1757, 6). Neither argues for his assertion. Both regard it as\ncommonplace that objects of intellect may be objects of taste as\nreadily as objects of sight and hearing may be. Why should the\npresent-day aesthetic theorist think otherwise? If an object is\nconceptual in nature, grasping its nature will require intellectual\nwork. If grasping an object\u2019s conceptual nature requires\nsituating it art-historically, then the intellectual work required to\ngrasp its nature will include situating it art-historically.\nBut\u2014as Hume and Reid held (see section 1.1)\u2014grasping the\nnature of an object preparatory to aesthetically judging it is one\nthing; aesthetically judging the object once grasped is another.\n\nThough Danto has been the most influential and persistent critic of\nformalism, his criticisms are no more decisive than those advanced by\nKendall Walton in his essay \u201cCategories of Art.\u201d\nWalton\u2019s anti-formalist argument hinges on two main theses, one\npsychological and one philosophical. According to the psychological\nthesis, which aesthetic properties we perceive a work as having\ndepends on which category we perceive the work as belonging to.\nPerceived as belonging to the category of painting, Picasso\u2019s\nGuernica will be perceived as \u201cviolent, dynamic, vital,\ndisturbing\u201d (Walton 1970, 347). But perceived as belonging to\nthe category of \u201cguernicas\u201d\u2014where guernicas are\nworks with \u201csurfaces with the colors and shapes of\nPicasso\u2019s Guernica, but the surfaces are molded to\nprotrude from the wall like relief maps of different kinds of\nterrain\u201d\u2014Picasso\u2019s Guernica will be\nperceived not as violent and dynamic, but as \u201ccold, stark,\nlifeless, or serene and restful, or perhaps bland, dull, boring\u201d\n(Walton 1970, 347). That Picasso\u2019s Guernica can be\nperceived both as violent and dynamic and as not violent and not\ndynamic might be thought to imply that there is no fact of the matter\nwhether it is violent and dynamic. But this implication holds only on\nthe assumption that there is no fact of the matter which category\nPicasso\u2019s Guernica actually belongs to, and this\nassumption appears to be false given that Picasso intended that\nGuernica be a painting and did not intend that it be a\nguernica, and that the category of paintings was well-established in\nthe society in which Picasso painted it while the category of\nguernicas was not. Hence the philosophical thesis, according to which\nthe aesthetic properties a work actually has are those it is perceived\nas having when perceived as belonging to the category (or categories)\nit actually belongs to. Since the properties of having been intended\nto be a painting and having been created in a society in which\npainting is well-established category are artistically relevant though\nnot graspable merely by seeing (or hearing) the work, it seems that\nartistic formalism cannot be true. \u201cI do not deny,\u201d Walton\nconcludes, \u201cthat paintings and sonatas are to be judged solely\non what can be seen or heard in them\u2014when they are perceived\ncorrectly. But examining a work with the senses can by itself reveal\nneither how it is correct to perceive it, nor how to perceive it that\nway\u201d (Walton 1970, 367).\n\nBut if we cannot judge which aesthetic properties paintings and\nsonatas have without consulting the intentions and the societies of\nthe artists who created them, what of the aesthetic properties of\nnatural items? With respect to them it may appear as if there is\nnothing to consult except the way they look and sound, so that an\naesthetic formalism about nature must be true. Allen Carlson, a\ncentral figure in the burgeoning field of the aesthetics of nature,\nargues against this appearance. Carlson observes that Walton\u2019s\npsychological thesis readily transfers from works of art to natural\nitems: that we perceive Shetland ponies as cute and charming and\nClydesdales as lumbering surely owes to our perceiving them as\nbelonging to the category of horses (Carlson 1981, 19). He also\nmaintains that the philosophical thesis transfers: whales actually\nhave the aesthetic properties we perceive them as having when we\nperceive them as mammals, and do not actually have any contrasting\naesthetic properties we might perceive them to have when we perceive\nthem as fish. If we ask what determines which category or categories\nnatural items actually belong to, the answer, according to Carlson, is\ntheir natural histories as discovered by natural science (Carlson\n1981, 21\u201322). Inasmuch as a natural item\u2019s natural history\nwill tend not to be graspable by merely seeing or hearing it,\nformalism is no truer of natural items than it is of works of art.\n\nThe claim that Walton\u2019s psychological thesis transfers to\nnatural items has been widely accepted (and was in fact anticipated,\nas Carlson acknowledges, by Ronald Hepburn (Hepburn 1966 and 1968)).\nThe claim that Walton\u2019s philosophical thesis transfers to\nnatural items has proven more controversial. Carlson is surely right\nthat aesthetic judgments about natural items are prone to be mistaken\ninsofar as they result from perceptions of those items as belonging to\ncategories to which they do not belong, and, insofar as determining\nwhich categories natural items actually belong to requires scientific\ninvestigation, this point seems sufficient to undercut the\nplausibility of any very strong formalism about nature (see Carlson\n1979 for independent objections against such formalism). Carlson,\nhowever, also wishes to establish that aesthetic judgments about\nnatural items have whatever objectivity aesthetic judgments about\nworks of art do, and it is controversial whether Walton\u2019s\nphilosophical claim transfers sufficiently to support such a claim.\nOne difficulty, raised by Malcolm Budd (Budd 2002 and 2003) and Robert\nStecker (Stecker1997c), is that since there are many categories in\nwhich a given natural item may correctly be perceived, it is unclear\nwhich correct category is the one in which the item is perceived as\nhaving the aesthetic properties it actually has. Perceived as\nbelonging to the category of Shetland ponies, a large Shetland pony\nmay be perceived as lumbering; perceived as belonging to the category\nof horses, the same pony may be perceived as cute and charming but\ncertainly not lumbering. If the Shetland pony were a work of art, we\nmight appeal to the intentions (or society) of its creator to\ndetermine which correct category is the one that fixes its aesthetic\ncharacter. But as natural items are not human creations they can give\nus no basis for deciding between equally correct but aesthetically\ncontrasting categorizations. It follows, according to Budd, \u201cthe\naesthetic appreciation of nature is endowed with a freedom denied to\nthe appreciation of art\u201d (Budd 2003, 34), though this is perhaps\nmerely another way of saying that the aesthetic appreciation of art is\nendowed with an objectivity denied to the appreciation of nature.\n",
