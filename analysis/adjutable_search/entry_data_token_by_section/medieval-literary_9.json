Of these three types of literature which become more\nsignificant in the 13th and 14th centuries, obligatio is the\nonly one that unambiguously refers to a form of argument.\nSophismata and insolubilia can refer either to the\npropositions that might be discussed in a debate or treatise or other\nform, or a form of argument for discussing these types of\npropositions. The literature concerning these kinds of problems ranges\nfrom formal disputes on the propositions which attempt to solve or\navoid the problem posed by the statements to treatises or rules about\nhow to solve the puzzles the disputes over them reveal. As a type of\nproposition, sophismata are ambiguous propositions about\nwhich arguments might plausibly be given both that they are true and\nthat they are false. They are, as Ashworth puts it, \u201cthe\nmedieval ancestor of \u2018the morning star is the evening\nstar\u2019,\u201d that is, a proposition epitomizing a larger\nproblem (Ashworth 1992, 518). Insolubilia are propositions\nthat are either very difficult or impossible to hold as true or false.\nThese propositions are usually self-referential paradoxes such as the\nliar paradox (e.g., \u2018everything I say is false\u2019). The\ninfluential view of William Heytesbury was that insolubles should be\nresolved in the context of an obligatio, a specialized form\nof disputation, and Heytesbury proposes rules for solving\ninsolubilia as well as sophismata in this way (Spade\n1982, 252). (For a catalog of insolubilia literature, see\nSpade 1975).\n\nSophismata discussed in the form of a disputation usually\ninvolve the offering of arguments both for the truth and for the\nfalsity of the proposition, resolved by a master. The resolution might\nonly be a statement about whether the sophism is true or false; then,\nmore elaborate replies to objections to the master\u2019s view might\nbe discussed. This form can be complicated by the addition of a\nresponse offered and defended and then further attacked, and then once\nagain defended by responses to the new set of opposing arguments. Oral\ndisputations on sophisms, the origin of much of the\nsophismata literature, were an important part of the school\ncurriculum (see Courtenay 1987). Students would serve as opponent and\nthen respondent in a series of disputations under the direction of a\nmaster. Ashworth notes that some sophismata, such as those by\nKilvington and Heytesbury, were original compositions, not edited\nversions of live debates (Ashworth 1992, 519). (For more about\nKilvington\u2019s sophismata, see the edition with\ntranslation and commentary by Kretzmann and Kretzmann 1990.) The\ndiscussion of sophisms occurs in three different settings in the\nmedieval literature: first, sophisms which are discussed in works on\ndifferent topics where the sophism raises certain questions germaine\nto that topic; second, works by a single author which examine a series\nof sophisms (e.g., the sophismata of Albert of Saxony or John\nBuridan), and third, collections of sophisms discussed by diverse\nauthors (Read 1993).\n\nIn the obligational form of disputation, an opponent puts something\nforward to a respondent. The respondent then \u2018obligates\u2019\nhimself to take a certain position on the case put forward by the\nopponent throughout the dispute. There are different types of\nobligations based on the type of claim the opponent proposes and the\nstance the respondent adopts towards it. (On the different types, see\nStump 1982, 319\u2013323.) The goal of the opponent is to trap the\nrespondent into a contradiction and the goal of the respondent is to\navoid the contradiction. The setting of the discussion is crucial\nsince the obligation often involves the evaluation of statements that\ndepend on the disputational context. So, for example, the respondent\nis often obligated to take a position on propositions which make\nreference to their granting or denying something within the\ndisputation (e.g., \u2018that you are in Rome must be granted [by\nyou]\u2019) (Stump 1982, 327). In other cases, the difficulty is\ncaused by reference to the passage of time within the dispute. So it\nis posited that something is true at A, but it becomes false and\nimpossible that it be true later in the disputation since the instant\nA has passed (Stump 1982, 328). Often, the dispute between the\nopponent and respondent is set up to result in a paradox. In such\ncases, the solution must happen outside the debate between the two\nparties, in which there is a further distinction or disqualification\nof something originally granted in the disputation.\n\nAlthough it has usually been supposed that medieval interest in\nsophismata and insolubilia came from medieval\nscholars\u2019 exposure to ancient sources, like Arisotle\u2019s\nSophistical Refutations, rediscovered in the Middle Ages,\nAngel D\u2019Ors has suggested that their origins might instead be\nfound in earlier medieval sources concerned with the problem of\nskepticism, like Augustine\u2019s Soliloquia, and Contra\nAcademicos, as well as Anselm\u2019s De Veritate,\nProslogion and so forth (D\u2019Ors 1997). Ashworth ties\ntheir origin to the 12th c. practice of adducing counter-examples to\npoint out the flaws in reasoning for an apparently plausible thesis\n(Ashworth 1992, 518). D\u2019Ors further suggests that discussions of\nsophisms which continue in theological texts show not the interest in\nsophisms bleeding over into theology, but theological contexts as the\nimpetus for interest in logical sophisms (D\u2019Ors 1997).\n2.10 Summa\n\nThe aspiration of the summa form is two-fold: first, to\ncompletely emancipate the subject matter, whether logical,\ntheological, or philosophical, from the structure dictated either by\nscripture or authoritative sources; and second, to cover completely an\nentire discipline, often but not always, in summary form.\n\nThe summa form was invented by Peter Helias. His Summa\nsuper Priscianum was written around 1150, more than a century\nbefore Peter of Spain composed his logical summa and Thomas\nAquinas his theological summa. Peter Helias\u2019s\nsumma combines a commentary on Priscian\u2019s text with a\nsystematic consideration of all the aspects of grammar (Reilly 1993,\n16).\n\nWhat Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences are to the sentences\ngenre, Thomas Aquinas\u2019s two great summae, the Summa\nContra Gentiles and Summa Theologiae are to the\nsumma form. As with sentences collections, there are two\naspects of the form to be considered: the overall organizing structure\nand the method of confronting individual problems or questions. In\nterms of overall structure, the Contra Gentiles is a\nreflection of Aquinas\u2019s distinction between those things which\ncan be known by reason alone (e.g., that God exists) and those things\nwhich cannot be arrived at without revelation (e.g., the Trinity and\nIncarnation). Hence, the first three books of the Summa Contra\nGentiles, dealing with God and creation, use arguments which\ndepend only on reason to reach and support its conclusions. The fourth\nbook is concerned with those things that are known only through\nrevelation, in which revelation offers the principles from which the\nconclusions are drawn. The form for handling individual issues and\nproblems in the Contra Gentiles is not the quaestio\nbut a more affirmative defense of specific positions and against\nspecific heresies. And though it is unclear whether the title\nsumma is original (Jordan 1986, 182\u20133), the work fits\nthe summa form in its systematic arrangement of topics and\nits attempt to include all possible arguments for a given position and\nagainst its contrary. It has been argued that the Contra\nGentiles is not a polemical but a protreptic work, addressed to\nChristians, calling on them to deepen their understanding of the\nfaith, specifically about how to persuade others to Christian belief\n(Jordan 1986, 190, 194). On this view the gentiles in the\ntitle are not Muslims and Jews but the \u201cpre- or extra-Christian\nman, and metaphorically, the human mind under the tutelage of\nnature\u201d (Jordan 1986, 184).\n\nThe Summa Theologiae by contrast, uses an abbreviated form of\nthe disputed question. The questions are, however, artificial,\ncarefully composed imitations of disputations, not tied to any actual\noral debate as true disputed questions are. This gives Aquinas the\nopportunity to arrange the objections and authorities so as to achieve\na rhetorical as well as a logical effect. Thus, Aquinas\u2019s\nSumma Theologiae is different from Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences in two ways. The gathering of authorities around a\ngiven question is for Peter one of the main purposes of his work, to\nsome degree an end in itself, while for Aquinas those citations serve\nthe end of constructing an answer to the question. Further, while\nPeter dispenses with the question format when he finds an issue\nuncontroversial or largely settled by consensus, Aquinas always places\nissues in the format of a question, always finding arguments on both\nsides of an issue. For Peter, the question format is more a means to\nan end, and when the authorities he surveys are in agreement, he\ntreats the matter like settled case law. But what Aquinas wants to\nteach beginning students of theology, for whom he says the work is\ncomposed, is that speculation, not fixed answers, is at the heart of\nthe philosophical and theological enterprise. What he passes on to\nthose students is not information so much as training in a certain way\nof thinking.\n\nAt the macro level, the Summa Theologiae is organized into\nthree parts; first, a consideration of God; second, the rational\ncreature\u2019s movement toward God; and third, of Christ as the way\nto God. (For a recent discussion of and summary of the debates over\nhow to understand this organization, see Johnstone 2000.) In his\nprologue, Aquinas claims that the main contribution of his work is in\nits organization of topics and questions, following the order required\nby the subject instead of a book or a particular disputation. In this\nsense, both Aquinas\u2019s summae represent a further and\nalmost complete emancipation from a textual order to a logical order.\nWithin that logical structure, Aquinas devotes long passages to\nscripture, to the Genesis account of creation (Part I, qq.\n67\u201374), Hebrew scripture considered as the \u201cOld Law\u201d\n(Part II, first part, qq. 98\u2013106) and the life of Christ (Part\nIII, qq. 27\u201359). Moreover, the work retains its tie to texts in\nindividual questions which, as individual systematic questions are\naddressed, interpret authorities according to their response,\nultimately harmonizing rather than simply discarding discordant\nvoices.\n\nAfter Aquinas, the summa remains a form for the systematic\norganization of an entire area of study, though often it becomes a\nsummary, a collection of answers, a manual in which to look up answers\nto particular questions rather than a series of questions.\nOckham\u2019s Summa Logicae shares with the summa\ngenre in theology the attempt to organize an entire discipline\nsystematically. Ockham\u2019s principle of organization is first to\ndivide logic into terms and propositions and then to consider the\nvarious types of terms and propositions. Ockham\u2019s form for\nconsidering particular types of terms or propositions is generally\nstraightforward exposition occasionally mixed with a presentation of\nopposing positions and responses to the arguments for that position.\nJohn Buridan\u2019s Summulae de Dialectica from the mid-14th\ncentury begins as a commentary on Peter of Spain\u2019s Summulae\nLogicales (written between 1220\u20131250). While Peter\u2019s\nimmensely popular text (used into the 17th century) was a\n\u201csumma\u201d in the sense of short summaries of the topics of\nlogic, Buridan\u2019s important and also popular Summulae\nbased on Peter\u2019s text gives much more systematic explanations\nnot just assertations of definitions and propositions; thus it is a\n\u201csumma\u201d in the sense of a complete set of explanations,\ngiven in the author\u2019s own voice (Zupko 2003, 9). Though clearly\na teaching text, Buridan reconfigures the discipline of logic using\nthe \u201cnew logic\u201d (or logica moderna) to explain\nthe basic concepts in Peter\u2019s text, and, where necessary (e.g.,\nin the account of demonstration) composes both a base text and the\nexplanatory commentary on topics not covered by Peter (Zupko, 2003,\n100). As Zupko concludes, Buridan\u2019s \u201cSummulae is\nessentially a compendium of methods, a \u2018how-to\u2019 book for\nthe philosopher\u201d (Zupko, 2003, 135). In form, Ockham\u2019s and\nBuridan\u2019s works show a progression toward the modern treatise,\nsuch as that of Hume or Locke on human nature or understanding,\nbecause their exhaustive consideration of their topic and the\npresentation of the single voice of the author, rather than a dialogue\nor set of authorities from the tradition.\n3. Role of Authorities\n\nIf there is one formal characteristic found in medieval philosophical\ntexts of every relevant period and among all the religious\naffiliations of its practitioners, it is the citation of authoritative\ntexts, whether scripture, Plato, Aristotle, or other revered teachers.\nTo contemporary readers, such references seem to show a slavish\ndeference to authority and lack of autonomy or originality in the\nwriter. The explanation of this phenomenon is, of course, a good deal\nmore complex. The main way of approaching authoritative sources used\nby medieval writers was to find ways to forge agreements with and\namong authorities by reinterpreting them. Besides the strategies we\nmight recognize in modern practices of interpretation, there are\nnumber of ways in which medieval authors make a greater effort to\nbring an author\u2019s view into conversation and agreement with\ncontemporary discussions. This sometimes involves placing an\nauthor\u2019s claims in a larger context, such as supporting\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysical claims but in a limited way, as valid\nonly for the sublunary world. So, for example, Maimonides argues that\nAristotle\u2019s account of the eternity of motion makes perfect\nsense as an inference from the world as we now experience it, but is\nlimited to that context. Just as a boy reared on an island without\nwomen would have difficulty imagining how children might be conceived\nand born, Aristotle, Maimonides argues, might simply have had an\nexperience too limited to allow him to develop any other accounts of\nthe origin of things (Maimonides 1974, 295). Maimonides\u2019\nhandling of Aristotle in this example is more colorful and explicit\nthan other medieval thinkers, but the principle he uses is common.\nAlternatively, medieval interpreters often take a given citation out\nof context and assign it a new context. Hence, for example, Aquinas\ncites Augustine in support of his claim that theology is a science\nanalogous to an Aristotelian science as described in the Posterior\nAnalytics; however, Aquinas does not note that Augustine uses the\nterm \u2018science\u2019 in a much older and less technical way\n(Aquinas 1981, I, q. 1, a. 2). Alan of Lille supports the Pauline\nclaim that the \u201cinvisible things of God are known through the\nvisible things that are made\u201d only after arguing that the kind\nof knowledge in question is the knowledge of faith (Alan of Lille\n1954, 135\u20136). While Aquinas cites and supports the\ncategorization of sin in terms of Gregory the Great\u2019s scheme of\nthe seven deadly sins, he clearly subordinates Gregory\u2019s\nclassification to his own way of organizing notions of sin (Sweeney\n2012b). Though these examples are chosen to show the difference\nbetween modern and medieval interpretive practice, we cannot attribute\nsuch interpretations to bad faith on the part of writers like Aquinas\nor Alan of Lille or Maimonides. That is, they are not deliberately\nmisinterpreting their sources. Rather their strategies for harmonizing\nauthorities discordant with each other and with their own views are\npart of a hermeneutic whose basic assumption is that these authorities\nare all seeking and attempting to express part of a single truth. It\nis not a distortion or disservice to an authoritative source to put\nits views in a new context, making them appropriate to contemporary\nissues and fitting that source into the picture of the truth as it is\npresently known. The underlying concordance of all authorities is\ntaken as a given and interpreters work toward showing how it might be\noperative in particular cases. As Silano notes, many of the tensions\nand even outright contradictions between authoritative sources would\nhave disappeared had the compilers, commentators, and masters\ndetermining a question placed those authoritative claims in their\nhistorical/cultural context rather than simply set them against each\nother. But they would also, thereby, deprive these sources of their\nnormative status, in the same way in which a judicial decision\ninterpreted in terms of its historical/cultural context is no longer\nbinding (Silano 2007, xxv\u2013xxvi). Silano points out that the task\nof the 12th and 13th centuries in the Latin West is the establishment\nof authorities which will form the parameters within which discussion\nand dissention can take place, rather than their dethronement through\nhistorical relativization (Silano 2007, xxv\u2013xxvi).\n\nThe way in which scripture is cited is somewhat different from the way\nAristotle or even church authorities like Augustine are used. First,\nscripture is a language in which these authors are thoroughly fluent.\nThey cite scripture from memory, almost proverbially. Further, when\nscripture is cited in argumentative forms like the disputation, most\noften it does not carry the weight of the argument. Either scripture\nis cited in opposing arguments on one side or the other, in which case\nscripture passages seem to articulate a limit or boundary the opposing\nview seems to transgress. But the positions or arguments articulated\npro or con on a given question are not the final word but something\nthe master may accept or reject, which will require an interpretation\nof the passage from scripture which accepts, rejects, or qualifies its\nrelevance and apparent position on the question. When scripture is\ncited in the master\u2019s own answer, it functions as a support for\nsomething for which independent arguments are given. Scripture is also\nsometimes used to give a position moral and spiritual weight, to\nreiterate the moral and spiritual center of a writer\u2019s thought.\nIt thus can act as an almost existential reminder of why these\narguments matter and what is at stake in them.\n\nIf these are strategies that in general characterize the Latin\ntradition until the 13th century, there is a different strategy at\nwork in some philosophers in the Arabic and Jewish traditions. While\nthese authors also attempt in many cases to show the deep concordance\nbetween, for example, scripture and the philosophers, they also at\ntimes use authoritative texts to put forward views which they\nthemselves would like to promulgate even as they leave them in the\nmouths of those other authors, like Aristotle or Plato.\n\nAs is clear from the development of the sentences collection,\nsumma, and commentary, there are significant changes over\ntime in the ways in which authorities were used and cited (see the\ndiscussion of these individual forms above). It is possible to see the\nevolution of the treatment of authoritative sources as growing\npositively toward a more modern \u2018scientific\u2019 attitude\ntowards interpretation and commentary, one which is neutral, critical,\nand historically informed rather than dedicated to finding the\n\u2018truth\u2019 in a given author no matter how hidden. But while\nthere is considerable development toward modern standards of\nscholarship in the 13th and 14th centuries, there are also virtues in\nthe earlier types of approach to authoritative sources. These earlier\nauthors are highly sophisticated interpreters of biblical and\nphilosophical texts, finding levels of conflict and concord among\ndifferent authors that modern interpreters would tend to miss.\n4. Esotericism, Censorship, and Polemics\n\nMany late classical and medieval philosophical texts contain esoteric\nelements. The desire to hide the real message of a text in its earlier\nforms springs from some form of gnosticism. Gnostic sects, needing to\nprotect their knowledge from dissemination among non-initiates, hid\ntheir true message in ways that could only be deciphered by those who\npossessed the secret knowledge. Leo Strauss makes the additional\nargument that the motives for esotericism in Jewish and Islamic\nmedieval thinkers are political. Revelation in Judaism and Islam deals\nfundamentally with law, with the correct social order, whereas in\nChristianity it is the revelation of a creed or set of dogmas, Strauss\nargues. Hence, to interpret revelation in Judaism and Islam is always\na political act. Interpreting law is much further from the task of\nphilosophy than interpreting dogma, placing philosophy on the\nperiphery of Islamic and Jewish society as opposed to being an\nintegral part of the official training of students as it was in the\nChristian West. The inherently marginal character of philosophy in\nthese societies makes it politically dangerous to be a philosopher.\nFurther, Strauss argues, for these thinkers human nature is\nessentially and inevitably divided between \u201cthe few\u201d who\nare capable to doing and understanding philosophy, and \u201cthe\nmany\u201d who were not capable of digesting the truths of philosophy\nand who must be protected from philosophy. Exposure of the many to\nphilosophy tends to undermine the authority of revelation and the\nreligious and political authority given the power to explain and\npromulgate the revealed law. For Strauss, the difference between\nJewish and Islamic thinkers, on the one hand, and Christian thinkers,\non the other, is also exemplified in the different literary sources on\nwhich they relied. For Christian thinkers, the models are Aristotle\nand Cicero, for Jewish and Islamic thinkers, the models are the\ndialogues of Plato, especially the Republic and the\nLaws. Strauss\u2019s thesis is that these writers hid in\ntheir exoteric teaching an esoteric teaching to be discerned by\nreading between the lines. In practice, this means taking small\ninconsistencies and other discrepancies in the text as indicative of a\ndeeper or hidden view, looking for the author\u2019s\n\u201creal\u201d views in the mouths of characters in a dialogue or\nallegory who are otherwise presented unfavorably, etc. Strauss\u2019s\nviews on how to interpret the literary form of medieval philosophical\ntexts are controversial, but they have made the literary form and\nhermeneutics applied to these texts a question that must, especially\nfor Islamic and Jewish writers, be confronted. For Maimonides, for\nexample, an esoteric or \u2018dualist\u2019 reading would claim that\nMaimonides holds Aristotelian positions on the eternity of the world,\nthe possibility of miracles and on other matters which would bring him\ninto conflict with Judaism but must hide such views from political and\nreligious authorities, signalling them only obliquely to the few in\nthe Guide for the Perplexed but expressing non-Aristotelian\nviews in his work commenting on Jewish law and scriptures. Daniel\nFrank (2003, 144\u20135) argues against this view that Maimonides\n\u201cmay best be understood philosophically as engaged in critical\ndialogue with Aristotle, almost invariably disagreeing with him, but\nindebted to Aristotle for his mode of discourse, argument forms, and\nphilosophical vocabulary.\u201d Moreover, Frank points out that the\nplausibility of extreme esotericism in Islamic and Jewish\nphilosophical texts may be exaggerated by an unhistorical dichotomy\nbetween Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism (also discussed above,\nsection 2. 4) (Frank 2003, 142\u20133). That is, because we see a\nconflict between and author\u2019s Aristotelian and Neoplatonic\nviews, we speculate that one view is their \u2018real\u2019 view,\nand the other, their \u2018cover\u2019 view, while thinkers in this\ncontext would have seen Aristotelian and Neoplatonic positions as\nquite compatible. (On Maimonides and esotericism, see also Ravitsky\n2005).\n\nWhile rejecting the extreme position Strauss takes on medieval\nphilosophical texts, many scholars have noted the esoteric elements\npresent in some medieval texts by Christian as well as Islamic and\nJewish writers (see Butterworth 2001). Boethius, for example, presents\nhis theological views not to the many but to his trusted teachers and\nadvisors, writing in a highly dense and technical language in his\nDe Hebdomadibus accessible only to the learned (Boethius\n1973, 38\u201341). As late as the end of the 12th century, Alan of\nLille writes in theological texts of the need to protect the sacred\ntruths of theology from the incursions of uneducated students in the\nliberal arts (Alan of Lille 1981, 119\u2013122), and, in the 11th\ncentury, Anselm complains of the work he intended only for his fellow\nmonks in the Cur Deus Homo being disseminated without his\nconsent and in a form he did not approve of (Anselm 1998,\n261\u20132). Like many medieval authors, he expresses great concern\nthat his work will be misunderstood and strives to protect himself\nfrom misinterpretation. Just as writers chose certain forms and\nrhetoric for philosophical texts for learned and elite audiences, so\ndifferent literary forms were chosen for works intended for a wide and\npopular audience, using the forms of encyclopedia and instructional\nmanuals, but also poetry, sermons, biblical exegesis and mystical\nwritings to introduce philosophical ideas to a wide audience (See\nAbram, Harvey, and Muelethaler 2022).\n\nIn the Latin, Christian world, though philosophy and speculative\ntheology is accepted as a legitimate endeavor, enshrined by the 13th\ncentury in the university curriculum, philosophical writers were\nsometimes censured by theological authorities, and some views were at\nvarious times condemned as false and contrary to the faith, most\nfamously in what is known as the Condemnation of 1277 (Thiessen 1998;\nAertsen, Emery, et al. 2001; and Bianchi 2003). This threat, some have\nargued, influenced some writers to pull their punches, to make\nconcessions or professions of ignorance or humility that were not\nauthentically part of their views. Hence, for example, some have\nargued that Abelard\u2019s statement in his theology disclaiming any\nability or pretense to address the issues necessary for salvation or\nto give anything more than verisimilitudes about the divine, is a\nconcession to his persecutors more than a sincere statement of his\nview of his own work (Abelard 1987, 123, 201; Sweeney 2006,\n90\u20133). Christian writers operating before the formation of the\nuniversities and the development of acceptable university forms of\nwriting, i.e., commentaries on Aristotle, on the Sentences of\nPeter Lombard, disputed questions, etc., need to justify their\nwriting, to explain the nature of its audience, to show the\nauthor\u2019s submission to the proper authorities. Readers must\nconsider whether these kinds of statements can simply be disregarded\nas obligatory but not sincere, and whether they affect the\npresentation of the philosophical and theological arguments in the\ntext. While it might be tempting to see them merely as pro\nforma, it is clear that complete disregard of such remarks is\nanachronistic. Such views, for example, contributed to the now\nthoroughly rejected view of Abelard as pure rationalist and as a rebel\nagainst church authority. Nonetheless, concern about avoiding conflict\nor censure is real among these writers. For example, after the\ncondemnation of many Aristotelian positions in 1277, authors take care\nto note when they are simply citing or describing a point of view in\norder to consider it or argue against it, signaling with a phrase like\n\u201cdico recitative\u201d that they are not subscribing\nto that position.\n\nParallel to the highly formalized and structured debate of the\ndisputations in the later Middle Ages, there are also highly\nformalized ways of engaging in debate with one\u2019s contemporaries\nthat shift to some degree over time. In the 12th and 13th centuries,\nfor example, while it is acceptable to attach names of church teachers\nand authorities from earlier generations to opposing positions, even\nto positions opposed by the contemporary writer of a text, one\u2019s\ncontemporaries or from the recent past were never directly named but\nmerely referred to as \u201csomeone\u201d or \u201ccertain\npeople\u201d who might hold a given position. However, this should\nnot be interpreted as deference to one\u2019s contemporaries or as an\nattempt to quell controversy, since authors became adept at signaling\ntheir opponents without actually naming them, paraphrasing or\nparodying their views or catchphrases as modes of ridicule or play. In\nthe late 13th century, Duns Scotus begins to give partial references\nto the contemporary thinkers and texts with which he is in\nconversation; Peter Aureol in the 14th century gives full and accurate\ncitations. Gregory of Rimini (d. 1358) begins to develop something\ncloser to a \u201chistorico-critical approach to theology,\u201d\ncarefully citing authoritative texts.\n\nThis development parallels one in some medieval sermons, where the\nwriters find ways of referring (often by puns) to themselves as author\nof the sermon. The shift is from an interest in the arguments to\ninterest in the individual thinkers. One cause for these changes might\nbe the internationalization of the writers and texts. In a more\nparochial world, everyone would know who held certain positions; but\nin a wider context, those at Oxford, for example, might not be known\nand needed to be named in Paris. These changes might have also been\ncaused by the growing self-consciousness and sense of individuality\nhistorians have noticed in other aspects of medieval academic and\nsocial life.\n5. Development in the Literary form of Medieval Philosophy\n\nThe Islamic and Jewish traditions, as well as the Latin tradition\nuntil the 13th century, can be characterized by the diversity of\nliterary forms for philosophical texts. A good deal of the\nphilosophical creativity among these writers goes into the form in\nwhich they choose to write. The genres that dominate the 13th and 14th\ncentury in the Latin West, the Sentences commentary, the\ndisputed question, and the logical developments of these forms in\nobligationes and sophismata, are academic, highly\nchoreographed forms. In contrast to the earlier period, these forms do\nnot allow an author much creative latitude. It is possible to read the\ndevelopment and waning of various forms and the movement toward\nstandard forms in medieval philosophy in different ways. From one\npoint of view, the variety of forms which flourished from the 10th to\nthe 12th century can be seen as the high point from which the\nnarrowing into the academic forms of the 13th and 14th centuries seems\nlike a loss, not only in variety but from the connection to the larger\nspiritual and existential concerns treated in, for example, the\nallegories of Boethius or Avicenna and the meditations of Anselm. Both\nin the Byzantine world and in the Latin Renaissance, there is a\nrejection of scholastic forms in preference for the richer rhetorical\nand literary form of dialogue (see Buron, Gu\u00e9rin, and Lesage\n2015; Cameron and Gaul 2017). From another point of view (the more\nprevalent assumption of the secondary literature), the disputed\nquestion and other forms of high scholasticism are that toward which\nthe earlier centuries made somewhat uneven but steady steps. In these\nforms, some might argue, philosophy finds its center in arguments for\nand against different positions. (See Kretzmann 1997, 301, where he\nargues that issues of style and rhetoric are not relevant to\nAquinas\u2019 \u201cunadorned, straightforward, pellucid way of\nexpounding, analyzing, and arguing \u2014 [which is] ideal for\nphilosophy\u201d.) The assumption, one arguably bequeathed to the\nWestern philosophical tradition through Latin Medieval school forms,\nis that \u201cstraightforward argument\u201d is not itself a style,\nrhetoric, and/or genre but the pure form of rationality and, hence,\nphilosophy. Arguably, at least in the Latin tradition, this way of\nseeing philosophy as having only one form, the form of reason, was\nprompted by the reception of Aristotle\u2019s Posterior\nAnalytics with its model of demonstration as the standard for\nscience. Syllogistic arguments comprised of certain and necessary\npremises yield certain and necessary conclusions, making demonstration\na higher form than dialectic, which yields only probable conclusions,\nor rhetorical forms and methods, designed to persuade particular\naudiences. John of Salisbury, making his way through the Posterior\nAnalytics, writes in his Metalogicon (1159) that unlike\nother dialectical or rhetorical forms of arguments, only demonstration\ndoes not concern itself with those to be persuaded and is thus in\ndirect relationship to things. (John of Salisbury 1955, 79) In effect\nthis is the articulation of the standard of objectivity \u2013 that\nwhich is simply true independent of the time, place, or audience to\nwhom it is addressed, as opposed to that which is designed to persuade\nin a particular context. Thus, John makes scientific discourse \u2013\nand the pursuit of truth \u2013 the opposite of rhetorical and\nliterary discourse, giving reason (and, hence, philosophy) its ideal\nform. John notes that Aristotle is called \u201cthe\nPhilosopher\u201d because of his development of the science of\ndemonstration. (John of Salisbury 1955, 213) As Aristotle\u2019s\nideal of scientific demonstration and the Aristotelian corpus as a\nwhole forms university curriculum, philosophy also becomes the\ndiscipline we recognize as \u2018philosophy\u2019, an enterprise of\nreason alone and begins to function autonomously in the arts faculty,\nwhich were earlier seen as only preparatory to theology, law, or\nmedicine. We can also see different medieval forms for philosophy as\nindebted to either Plato or Aristotle as philosophical models.\nAristotle\u2019s influence we see in the culture and writings of the\nuniversity. Even though they lacked access to the Platonic dialogues,\nthe influence of Plato through Neoplatonism is evident in the forms\nthat flourish before the 13th century, in allegory, meditation, and\ndialogue. These forms emphasize both the spiritual character of the\nhighest truths philosophical/theological discourse strives to discover\nand reveal, and the difficulty, both intellectual and moral, of\nachieving insight.\n\nMuch more work needs to be done on the literary forms of medieval\nphilosophy. There are so many forms instantiated in so many ways in\ndifferent periods and from within different religious traditions.\nConsideration of these forms is especially important for a more\ncomplete understanding of medieval philosophical texts because so many\nof these forms are foreign to contemporary readers. Sometimes the form\nis important because an author was constrained by practice or academic\nstatute to use it, as with disputations and Sentences\ncommentaries; hence, how an author comes to use or manipulate a given\nform for his own ends is a significant part of understanding the text.\nWhen an author uses a non-standard form, that form is self-consciously\nchosen and thus in a different way a significant part of an\nauthor\u2019s meaning. It would be helpful to have studies of\nparticular authors who have used different forms, and more studies\ntracing the development of a given genre through different authors and\nperiods (as in Jacobi 1999 on dialogue and Whitman 2000 on allegory,\nEvans 2002 and Rosemann 2009 on Sentences commentaries).\nFinally, more historical work needs to be done by individual scholars\nequipped to look at the different genres across different periods and\nfrom within and across works arising out of Christian, Jewish, and\nArabic religious traditions. (See Hughes and Robinson 2019 on literary\nforms in Medieval Jewish Thought.). For Hughes and Robinson philosophy\nis never without literary form, nor (which comes to the same thing)\ndoes it have only one; they work to challenge the narrow conception of\nphilosophy that would divide the study of \u2018philosophical\u2019\ntexts from those that fall into the domain of \u201cJewish\nstudies\u201d that have more diverse literary forms. In the same way,\nwe have seen those studying the philosophical work of early Modern\nwomen make the case that we will miss this work if we restrict\nourselves to texts that take the form that is expected in contemporary\nacademic philosophy. Expanding the canon entails interrogating and\nbroadening the sense of what counts as a philosophical work, they\nargue. ",
