    "main_text": "\n\nThere are four historical modal paradigms in ancient philosophy: the\nfrequency interpretation of modality, the model of possibility as a\npotency, the model of antecedent necessities and possibilities with\nrespect to a certain moment of time (diachronic modalities), and the\nmodel of possibility as non-contradictoriness. None of these habits of\nthought, which were well known in early medieval times through the\nworks of Boethius, was based on the idea of modality as involving\nreference to simultaneous alternatives. This new paradigm was\nintroduced into Western thought in early twelfth-century discussions\ninfluenced by Augustine\u2019s theological conception of God as\nacting by choice between alternative histories.\n\nWhile the new idea of associating modal terms with simultaneous\nalternatives was used also in thirteenth-century theology, it was not\noften discussed in philosophical contexts at that time. The increasing\nacceptance of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy gave support to traditional\nmodal paradigms, as is seen in Robert Kilwardby\u2019s influential\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics, in which\nmodal syllogistic is treated as an essentialist theory of the\nstructures of being. There were analogous discussions of philosophical\nand theological modalities in Arabic philosophy. Arabic modal theories\ninfluenced Latin discussions mainly through the translations of\nAverroes\u2019s works.\n\nJohn Duns Scotus developed the model of modality as alternativeness\ninto a detailed theory. A logical possibility is something to which to\nbe is not repugnant, though it may not be compossible with other\npossibilities. Scotus\u2019s modal semantics influenced early\nfourteenth-century philosophy and theology in many ways.\nThirteenth-century essentialist assumptions were dropped from modal\nsyllogistic, the Aristotelian version of which was regarded as a\nfragmentary theory without a sufficient explication of the various\nfine structures of modal propositions. While the Aristotelian\nfrequency interpretation of modality was not found relevant in late\nmedieval logic, it continued to play a role in natural philosophy.\n",
