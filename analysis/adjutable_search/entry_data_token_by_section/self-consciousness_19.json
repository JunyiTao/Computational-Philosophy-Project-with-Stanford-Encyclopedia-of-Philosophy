    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in Infants and Non-Human Animals || Mirror Recognition\n5.1 Mirror Recognition\n\nIt has sometimes been claimed, most forcefully by Gallup and\ncolleagues, that the capacity to recognise oneself in the mirror is a\nmarker of self-consciousness (Gallup 1970; Gallup, Anderson, &\nPlatek 2011; Gallup, Platek, & Spaulding 2014). It is easy to see\nwhy this might seem to be so since, if first-person thought involves\nthinking about oneself as oneself, then it is natural to\nsuppose that a capacity to recognise that a subject seen in a mirror\nis oneself involves such a thought. In Evans\u2019s (1982)\nterminology such thoughts involve an \u201cidentification\ncomponent\u201d.\n\nGallup (1970) devised a test for mirror self-recognition:\nsurreptitiously placing a red mark on a subject\u2019s forehead\nbefore exposure to a mirror, then observing whether they touch the\nrelevant spot. It is well established that chimpanzees pass the mirror\ntest while other primate species fail (Anderson & Gallup 2011). It\nhas also been claimed that dolphins and some elephants pass the test\n(Reiss & Marino 2001; Plotnik et. al. 2006). With respect to human\ninfants, the consensus is that success in the mirror test begins at\naround 15 to 18 months of age, and that by 24 months most children\npass (Amsterdam 1972; M. Lewis & Brooks-Gunn 1979; Nielsen,\nSuddendorf, & Slaughter 2006).\n\nIt is not universally accepted, however, that success in the mirror\ntest is an indication of self-consciousness. For example, Heyes (1994)\npresents an influential critique of the claim that it is a marker of\nself-awareness, arguing that all that is required for success is that\nsubjects be able to distinguish between novel ways of receiving bodily\nfeedback in order to guide behaviour, on the one hand, and other forms\nof incoming sensory data, on the other. Such a view, however, needs to\nexplain why it is that passing the mirror test seems to be connected\nwith the phenomena arguably associated with self-consciousness, such\nas experiencing shame and embarrassment (M. Lewis 2011). There\nremains, then, significant controversy concerning what success in the\nmirror test really shows, and so whether it can shed light on the\ndevelopment of self-awareness (see, for example, Mitchell 1993;\nSuddendorf & Butler 2013; Gallup, Platek, & Spaulding 2014.\nFor related philosophical discussion, see Rochat & Zahavi 2011;\nPeacocke 2014: ch.8).\n",
