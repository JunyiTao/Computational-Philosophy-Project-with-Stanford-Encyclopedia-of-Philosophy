After all, this is\noften the purpose of an announcement: by making the announcement, we\nwish to inform everyone of its truth. However, it is not hard to come\nup with announcements that are true when announced but false\nafterward; that is, not all announcements are successful. Here are a\nfew everyday examples in plain English. \n\n Agent a, who is visiting Amsterdam for the first time,\nsteps off the plane in the Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and\ntruthfully says, \u201ca has never made a statement in\nAmsterdam\u201d.\n\nThis is unsuccessful because it is \u201cself-defeating\u201d: it\nrules out various past statements, but it itself is one of those ruled\nout, so the announcement violates what it says. \nAgent a who does not know it is raining, is told, \u201cIt\nis raining but a does not know it\u201d.\n\nThis is an example of a Moore formula, which are sentences of\nthe form \u201cp is true but agent a does not know\np.\u201c In the language \\eqref{ML}, Moore formulas have the\nform \\(p\\land\\lnot[a]p\\). An announcement of a Moore formula is\nunsuccessful because, after the announcement the agent comes to know\nthe first conjunct p (the statement \u201cit is raining\u201d\nin the example), which therefore falsifies the second conjunct\n\\(\\lnot[a]p\\) (the statement \u201ca does not know it is\nraining\u201d in the example). \n\n\nThe opposite of unsuccessful formulas are the \u201csuccessful\u201d\nones: these are the formulas that are true after they are announced.\nHere one should distinguish between \u201cperformative\nannouncements\u201d that bring about truth by their very occurrence\n(e.g., a judge says, \u201cThe objection is overruled\u201d, which\nhas the effect of making the objection overruled) and\n\u201cinformative announcements\u201d that simply inform their\nlisteners of truth (e.g., our mutual friend says, \u201cI live on\n207th Street\u201d, which has the effect of informing us of something\nthat is already true). Performative announcements are best addressed\nin a Dynamic Epistemic Logic setting using factual changes, a\ntopic discussed in\n Appendix G.\n For now our concern will be with informative announcements. \n\nThe phenomena of (un)successfulness of announcements was noted early\non by Hintikka (1962) but was not studied in detail until the advent\nof Dynamic Epistemic Logic. In DEL, the explicit language for public\nannouncements provides for an explicit syntactic definition of\n(un)successfulness. \n\n\n(Un)successful formula (van Ditmarsch and Kooi 2006; see also\nGerbrandy 1999). Let F be a formula in a language with\npublic announcements.\n\n To say that F is successful means that\n\\(\\models[F!]F\\).\n\n\u201cA successful formula is one that is always true after it is\nannounced.\u201d \nTo say that F is unsuccessful means that\nFis not successful (i.e., \\(\\not\\models[F!]F\\)).\n\n\u201cAn unsuccessful formula is one that may be false after it is\nannounced.\u201d \n\n\n\nAs we have seen, the Moore formula  \n\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\\tag{MF} p\\land\\lnot[a]p \\end{equation*}\\]\n\n\nis unsuccessful: if (MF) is true, then its announcement eliminates all\n\\(\\lnot p\\)-worlds, thereby falsifying \\(\\lnot[a]p\\) (since the truth\nof \\(\\lnot[a]p\\) requires the existence of an a-arrow leading\nto a \\(\\lnot p\\)-world). \n\nAn example of a successful formula is a propositional letter p.\nIn particular, after an announcement of p, it is clear that\np still holds (since the propositional valuation does not\nchange); that is, \\([p!]p\\). Moreover, as the reader can easily\nverify, the formula \\([a]p\\) is also successful. \n\nIn considering (un)successful formulas, a natural question arises: can\nwe provide an syntactic characterization of the formulas that are\n(un)successful? That is, is there a way for us know whether a formula\nis (un)successful simply by looking at its form? Building off of the\nwork of Visser et al. (1994) and Andr\u00e9ka, Ne\u0301meti, and van\nBenthem (1998), van Ditmarsch and Kooi (2006) provide one\ncharacterization of some of the successful \\eqref{PAL+C}-formulas.\n\n\n\nTheorem (van Ditmarsch and Kooi 2006). The\npreserved formulas are formed by the following grammar.\n\n\\[\\begin{gather*}\nF \\ccoloneqq p \\mid \\lnot p \\mid F\\land F \\mid F\\lor F\\mid [a]F\\mid [\\lnot F!]F \\mid [B*]F\n\\\\\n\\small p\\in\\sP,\\; a\\in\\sA,\\; B\\subseteq\\sA\n\\end{gather*}\\]\n\n Every preserved formula is successful.\n\n\nUsing a slightly different notion of successfulness wherein a formula\nF is said to be successful if and only if we have that\n\\(M,w\\models F\\land \\may{a}F\\) implies \\(M[F!],w\\models F\\) for each\npointed Kripke model \\((M,w)\\) coming from a given class \\(\\sC\\),\nHolliday and Icard (2010) provide a comprehensive analysis of\n(un)successfulness with respect to the class of single-agent\n\\(\\mathsf{S5}\\) Kripke models and with respect to the class of\nsingle-agent \\(\\mathsf{KD45}\\) Kripke models. In particular, they\nprovide a syntactic characterization of the successful formulas over\nthese classes of Kripke models. This analysis was extended in part to\na multi-agent setting by Saraf and Sourabh (2012). The highly\ntechnical details of these works are beyond the scope of the present\narticle. \n\nFor more on Moore sentences, we refer the reader to\n Section 5.3\n of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on\n Epistemic Paradoxes\n (Sorensen 2011). \n",
