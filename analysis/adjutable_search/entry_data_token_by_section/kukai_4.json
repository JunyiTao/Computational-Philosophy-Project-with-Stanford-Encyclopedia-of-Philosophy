This\ndistinction between \u201cesoteric\u201d (mitsu) and\n\u201cexoteric\u201d (ken) Buddhism is not found in his\nIndian predecessors. But some of his Japanese predecessors had already\nbeen using the binary ken-mitsu categories.\nK\u016bkai\u2019s contribution was to interpret them in a new way\nthrough appropriation of the esoteric texts he had brought back from\nChina. In K\u016bkai\u2019s thinking, that distinction is crucial.\nWhile we shall discuss some of these ideas in the following sections\nwith greater depth, we may here summarize the general distinctions\nlaid out in Benkenmitsu nikky\u014dron for now as follows: 1)\nFor exoteric Buddhism, the \u201cembodiment of truth\u201d (Skrt:\ndharmak\u0101ya; Jpn: hosshin) is abstract and\ntranscendent and hence does not preach. But for esoteric Buddhism, the\nphenomenal world from the enlightened perspective \u2013 that is, the\nstandpoint of the Buddha \u2013 is the preaching activity of\nthe cosmic Buddha Dainichi (Skrt: Mah\u0101vairocana) and\nas that \u201cembodiment of truth.\u201d Hence while\nexoteric teachings may be traced to \u015aakyamuni, the historical\nBuddha, esoteric teachings come directly from the Buddha Dainichi. 2)\nFor exoteric Buddhism, the absolute truth, i.e., the Dharma,\ntranscends world and language, and thus cannot be explained. But for\nesoteric Buddhism, that Dharma itself is being perpetually expressed\nin and as its embodiment in the phenomenal world, in\nits sounds, movements, and forms, and even in the thoughts of sentient\nbeings. In other words, its embodiment refers not only to the\nmeditation of the Buddha but also to the Buddha\u2019s creative and\ncommunicative activities. 3) Exoteric Buddhism lacks, according to\nK\u016bkai, a practical methodology for experiencing esoteric\ntruths. While exoteric Buddhism emphasizes the intellectual study and\ncomprehension of the doctrines set forth in the s\u016btras, esoteric\nBuddhism provides a bodily hermeneutic whereby esoteric truths hidden\nin the s\u016btras as well as in the world at large can be\nexperienced. And: 4) For exoteric Buddhism, it takes three infinitely\nlong epochs of repeated rebirths of training in order for one to\nattain enlightenment (Buddhahood); but esoteric Buddhism makes it\npossible for anyone, irrespective of karmic dispositions, to\nimmediately become a buddha in one\u2019s present embodied state.\n",
