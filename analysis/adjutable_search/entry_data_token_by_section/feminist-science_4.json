    "main_text": "Feminist Critique of Science || Critique of Concepts and Background Assumptions\n2.2 Critique of Concepts and Background Assumptions\n\nOne reason why eliminating bias sometimes involves more than merely\ndoing science better is that gender assumptions are not always\napparent to the researchers that are in their thrall. For example,\ngender assumptions sometimes enter scientific research through\nmetaphor. Some early feminist critique emphasized this avenue\n(Merchant 1980/1990; Keller 1985; Spanier 1995). When their\nunderstanding of the objects of inquiry is shaped through unexamined\ngendered metaphors, scientists risk misdescribing and consequently\nmisunderstanding the material world. Additionally, metaphors often aid\nin the reproduction or reinforcement of unequal power relations by\ncarrying sets of associated expectations with them.\n\nEvelyn Fox Keller offers the following example. The understanding of\novum/sperm reproduction was shaped (wrongly) by thinking of the sperm\nas masculine and the ovum as feminine. The projection of human gender\nexpectations onto the gametes resulted in an assumption that the ovum\nwas passive (as women stereotypically are) and the sperm active (as\nmen stereotypically are). Writing in 2001, Keller recounts a shift to\nthe recognition of an active role for both gametes: \n\n\nThe story provides a powerful lesson. It illustrates the ways in which\nlanguage can shape the thinking and acting of working\nscientists\u2014that is, by framing their attention, their\nperception, and, accordingly, the fields in which they can envision\nexperiments that might be useful to undertake. (Keller 2001: 106)\n\n\nMetaphors may signal hidden assumptions that play a role in\nidentifying what counts as relevant evidence. Sarah Richardson exposes\nand explores projective attributions of gender in the ways that\nstereotypical ideas about male and female traits shape research on\nchromosomes and sex determination. She argues that \n\n\n[f]rom the earliest theories of chromosomal sex determination to the\nmidcentury hypothesis of the aggressive XYY supermale, the\nlongstanding belief that the X is the \u201cfemale chromosome\u201d,\nand the recent claim that males and females have \u201cdifferent\ngenomes\u201d, cultural gender conceptions have influenced the\ndirection of sex chromosome genetics. (Richardson 2013: 2) \n\n\nAs one example of the effects of this projection she discusses the\nfailed supermale hypothesis\u2014the idea that XYY males have more\n\u201cmaleness\u201d in virtue of having two Y chromosomes.\nSupermales were hypothesized to be, among other things, more\naggressive. Their greater numbers in both psychiatric and correctional\ninstitutions seemed to support this. The gendering of the Y\nchromosome\u2014thinking of it as having stereotypically male\ntraits\u2014supported a flawed transitive reasoning: Y distinguishes\nmaleness, males with double Y should have more (double?) maleness\n(e.g., aggression). The result was not only a false conclusion but a\nfailure to examine evidence that did not support the hypothesis. For\nexample, institutional populations also contain a disproportionate\nnumber of XXY males. Using the same gender stereotypical reasoning,\nthis evidence would be inconsistent with the supermale hypothesis.\nUltimately the hypothesis was discredited for a variety of reasons,\nbut this \u201cembarrassment\u201d in chromosomal sex determination\nresearch is only one example of how assumptions about gender can shape\nunderstanding of the object of inquiry. Richardson argues that such\nareas of research carry with them \u201cgender valence\u201d\u2014a\nmore nuanced projective gendering of the subject matter that is more\nsubtle than what is typically referred to as \u201cgender\nbias\u201d.\n\nMetaphor is not the only avenue through which projections occur.\nAssumed similarity of the experience of men and women and the further\nassumption that the experiences of men are the norm is another.\nElisabeth Lloyd\u2019s extended case study of accounts of female\norgasm illustrates how an assumption of this sort can prevent the\nconsideration of relevant evidence (Lloyd 2005). She examines 21\naccounts (hypotheses) proposed for giving an evolutionary explanation\nfor female orgasm\u2014a seeming anomaly in that it does not appear\nto be necessary for reproduction. Of these, only one (the byproduct\naccount proposed by Donald Symons in 1979) incorporates a key piece of\nevidence\u2014that many women do not experience orgasm with\nintercourse and many women do experience orgasm without\nintercourse.\n\nShe reviews the accounts and identifies two background assumptions\nthat inform all accounts except Symons\u2019s. They are: the\nadaptationist assumption that \n\n\nnatural selection, rather than other evolutionary forces, directly\nshaped the trait into its present form, or that natural selection is\ncurrently maintaining the trait in the population\u2026.(Lloyd 2005:\n230) \n\n\nand \n\n\nthe androcentric assumption that males are taken to be the normal type\nor the exemplar. \n\n\nThe second of these has the problematic result that \u201cto the\nextent that they differ from the male type, females are\ninvisible\u201d (Lloyd 2005: 233). She takes these background\nassumptions to be responsible for the failure to consider the evidence\nthat human females do not consistently achieve orgasm with intercourse\nand do achieve orgasm without intercourse. She argues that any account\nthat does not explain this anomalous evidence should be considered\nproblematic.\n\nAlthough Symon\u2019s account is not without problems, Lloyd argues\nthat it fits the evidence better than the alternatives. Symons\nproposes that female orgasm is a byproduct of evolution rather than a\nresult of natural selection, a hypothesis that he is able to consider\nbecause he is not assuming that orgasm in females must serve a\nreproductive function since it does in males. His explanation for\nfemale orgasm is that the biological development of males and females\nis parallel so that the features that lead to orgasm in males (nerves,\nerectile tissues, etc.) are also present in females, but not always\nactivated. Female orgasm is thus a byproduct of human evolution in\nmuch the same way that male nipples are a byproduct and just as the\nmale nipples play no role in human reproduction neither does female\norgasm.\n\nLloyd argues that the inclusion of sexist values (the androcentric\nunderstanding of orgasm) prevent the consideration of the available\ndata on female orgasm as evidence. Symons\u2019 account does not rely\non this androcentric understanding of the phenomenon under\ninvestigation and consequently his hypothesis can both consider and\naccount for these data.\n\nThe examples offered here indicate that the way the objects of inquiry\nare understood can shape the resulting science, but the example from\nLloyd\u2019s work also suggests that an epistemology that takes into\naccount the role of background assumptions (beliefs) in the context of\ninquiry is better equipped for thinking through how beliefs about\ngender can affect knowledge production. Both concerns point us towards\nfeminist philosophy of science, to be discussed in\n section 4.\n But first, section 3 considers the question of the appropriate\nmethods for feminist research.\n",
