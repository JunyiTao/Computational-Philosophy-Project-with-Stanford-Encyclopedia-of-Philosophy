    "main_text": "The Concept of Progress || Aspects of Scientific Progress\n2.1 Aspects of Scientific Progress\n\nScience is a multi-layered complex system involving a community of\nscientists engaged in research using scientific methods in order to\nproduce new knowledge. Thus, the notion of science may refer to a\nsocial institution, the researchers, the research process, the method\nof inquiry, and scientific knowledge. The concept of progress can be\ndefined relative to each of these aspects of science. Hence, different\ntypes of progress can be distinguished relative to science:\neconomical (the increased funding of scientific research),\nprofessional (the rising status of the scientists and their\nacademic institutions in the society), educational (the\nincreased skill and expertise of the scientists), methodical\n(the invention of new methods of research, the refinement of\nscientific instruments), and cognitive (increase or\nadvancement of scientific knowledge). These types of progress have to\nbe conceptually distinguished from advances in other human activities,\neven though it may turn out that scientific progress has at least some\nfactual connections with technological progress (increased\neffectiveness of tools and techniques) and social progress\n(economic prosperity, quality of life, justice in society).\n\nAll of these aspects of scientific progress may involve different\nconsiderations, so that there is no single concept that would cover\nall of them. For our purposes, it is appropriate here to concentrate\nonly on cognitive progress, i.e., to give an account of advances of\nscience in terms of its success in knowledge-seeking or\ntruth-seeking.\n",
