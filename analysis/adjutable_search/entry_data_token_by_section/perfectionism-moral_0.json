    "main_text": "Perfectionism and Value Theory\n1. Perfectionism and Value Theory\n\n\nThe first thing to say is that an objective account of the good need\nnot make reference to the good of human beings. Some people think\nthat certain aspects of the natural world are valuable and would have\nvalue even if no human being existed. Others believe that great\nachievements in art and science have value beyond any effect that they\nhave on the lives of human beings. Perfectionist views that\naffirm judgments of this kind are examples of what can be called\nnonhumanistic perfectionism. Perfectionist accounts of\nthe human good, by contrast, are accounts that seek to identify the\ngoods that contribute to the value of a life for human beings.\n\n\nThe good life for human beings can be understood in at least two\nimportantly different ways. On the first understanding, such a life is\nconstrued in terms of well-being. The best life for a human being is a\nlife that goes maximally well for the person who leads it. On the\nsecond understanding, the good life for a human being is construed in\nterms of excellence or success. An excellent human life could be a\nlife that is best in terms of well-being, but it need not be, for it\nis possible that such a life requires a human being to make sacrifices\nin his own well-being for the sake of other persons or goods. Thus the\nnotion of an excellent human life is broader than that of a life high\nin well-being. And since it is the broader notion, a general\ncharacterization of perfectionism should employ it rather than\n well-being.[1]\n\n\nPerfectionism, so understood, contrasts with both hedonism and desire\nsatisfaction accounts of the human good. Let \u2018X\u2019\nrefer to an object, an activity or a relationship. Then, for the\nperfectionist, if X is good, then it is not good in virtue of\nthe fact that it is desired, or would be desired under appropriate\nconditions, by human beings. Likewise, for the perfectionist,\nif X is good, it does not follow that X must be a\npleasant mental state or causally related to one. Perfectionist\naccounts of the human good, of course, can allow that some goods are\nexperiential, but they reject the hedonistic thesis that all intrinsic\nhuman goods consist in pleasurable sensations or attitudes.\n",
