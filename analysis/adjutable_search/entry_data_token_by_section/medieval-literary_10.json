    "main_text": "Role of Authorities\n3. Role of Authorities\n\nIf there is one formal characteristic found in medieval philosophical\ntexts of every relevant period and among all the religious\naffiliations of its practitioners, it is the citation of authoritative\ntexts, whether scripture, Plato, Aristotle, or other revered teachers.\nTo contemporary readers, such references seem to show a slavish\ndeference to authority and lack of autonomy or originality in the\nwriter. The explanation of this phenomenon is, of course, a good deal\nmore complex. The main way of approaching authoritative sources used\nby medieval writers was to find ways to forge agreements with and\namong authorities by reinterpreting them. Besides the strategies we\nmight recognize in modern practices of interpretation, there are\nnumber of ways in which medieval authors make a greater effort to\nbring an author\u2019s view into conversation and agreement with\ncontemporary discussions. This sometimes involves placing an\nauthor\u2019s claims in a larger context, such as supporting\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysical claims but in a limited way, as valid\nonly for the sublunary world. So, for example, Maimonides argues that\nAristotle\u2019s account of the eternity of motion makes perfect\nsense as an inference from the world as we now experience it, but is\nlimited to that context. Just as a boy reared on an island without\nwomen would have difficulty imagining how children might be conceived\nand born, Aristotle, Maimonides argues, might simply have had an\nexperience too limited to allow him to develop any other accounts of\nthe origin of things (Maimonides 1974, 295). Maimonides\u2019\nhandling of Aristotle in this example is more colorful and explicit\nthan other medieval thinkers, but the principle he uses is common.\nAlternatively, medieval interpreters often take a given citation out\nof context and assign it a new context. Hence, for example, Aquinas\ncites Augustine in support of his claim that theology is a science\nanalogous to an Aristotelian science as described in the Posterior\nAnalytics; however, Aquinas does not note that Augustine uses the\nterm \u2018science\u2019 in a much older and less technical way\n(Aquinas 1981, I, q. 1, a. 2). Alan of Lille supports the Pauline\nclaim that the \u201cinvisible things of God are known through the\nvisible things that are made\u201d only after arguing that the kind\nof knowledge in question is the knowledge of faith (Alan of Lille\n1954, 135\u20136). While Aquinas cites and supports the\ncategorization of sin in terms of Gregory the Great\u2019s scheme of\nthe seven deadly sins, he clearly subordinates Gregory\u2019s\nclassification to his own way of organizing notions of sin (Sweeney\n2012b). Though these examples are chosen to show the difference\nbetween modern and medieval interpretive practice, we cannot attribute\nsuch interpretations to bad faith on the part of writers like Aquinas\nor Alan of Lille or Maimonides. That is, they are not deliberately\nmisinterpreting their sources. Rather their strategies for harmonizing\nauthorities discordant with each other and with their own views are\npart of a hermeneutic whose basic assumption is that these authorities\nare all seeking and attempting to express part of a single truth. It\nis not a distortion or disservice to an authoritative source to put\nits views in a new context, making them appropriate to contemporary\nissues and fitting that source into the picture of the truth as it is\npresently known. The underlying concordance of all authorities is\ntaken as a given and interpreters work toward showing how it might be\noperative in particular cases. As Silano notes, many of the tensions\nand even outright contradictions between authoritative sources would\nhave disappeared had the compilers, commentators, and masters\ndetermining a question placed those authoritative claims in their\nhistorical/cultural context rather than simply set them against each\nother. But they would also, thereby, deprive these sources of their\nnormative status, in the same way in which a judicial decision\ninterpreted in terms of its historical/cultural context is no longer\nbinding (Silano 2007, xxv\u2013xxvi). Silano points out that the task\nof the 12th and 13th centuries in the Latin West is the establishment\nof authorities which will form the parameters within which discussion\nand dissention can take place, rather than their dethronement through\nhistorical relativization (Silano 2007, xxv\u2013xxvi).\n\nThe way in which scripture is cited is somewhat different from the way\nAristotle or even church authorities like Augustine are used. First,\nscripture is a language in which these authors are thoroughly fluent.\nThey cite scripture from memory, almost proverbially. Further, when\nscripture is cited in argumentative forms like the disputation, most\noften it does not carry the weight of the argument. Either scripture\nis cited in opposing arguments on one side or the other, in which case\nscripture passages seem to articulate a limit or boundary the opposing\nview seems to transgress. But the positions or arguments articulated\npro or con on a given question are not the final word but something\nthe master may accept or reject, which will require an interpretation\nof the passage from scripture which accepts, rejects, or qualifies its\nrelevance and apparent position on the question. When scripture is\ncited in the master\u2019s own answer, it functions as a support for\nsomething for which independent arguments are given. Scripture is also\nsometimes used to give a position moral and spiritual weight, to\nreiterate the moral and spiritual center of a writer\u2019s thought.\nIt thus can act as an almost existential reminder of why these\narguments matter and what is at stake in them.\n\nIf these are strategies that in general characterize the Latin\ntradition until the 13th century, there is a different strategy at\nwork in some philosophers in the Arabic and Jewish traditions. While\nthese authors also attempt in many cases to show the deep concordance\nbetween, for example, scripture and the philosophers, they also at\ntimes use authoritative texts to put forward views which they\nthemselves would like to promulgate even as they leave them in the\nmouths of those other authors, like Aristotle or Plato.\n\nAs is clear from the development of the sentences collection,\nsumma, and commentary, there are significant changes over\ntime in the ways in which authorities were used and cited (see the\ndiscussion of these individual forms above). It is possible to see the\nevolution of the treatment of authoritative sources as growing\npositively toward a more modern \u2018scientific\u2019 attitude\ntowards interpretation and commentary, one which is neutral, critical,\nand historically informed rather than dedicated to finding the\n\u2018truth\u2019 in a given author no matter how hidden. But while\nthere is considerable development toward modern standards of\nscholarship in the 13th and 14th centuries, there are also virtues in\nthe earlier types of approach to authoritative sources. These earlier\nauthors are highly sophisticated interpreters of biblical and\nphilosophical texts, finding levels of conflict and concord among\ndifferent authors that modern interpreters would tend to miss.\n",
