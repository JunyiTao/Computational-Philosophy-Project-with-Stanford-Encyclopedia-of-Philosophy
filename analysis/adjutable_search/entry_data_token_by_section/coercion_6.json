    "main_text": "Contemporary philosophical accounts of coercion || Threats and Baselines\n2.2 Threats and Baselines\n\nSince Nozick\u2019s essay, theorists have frequently treated the\nmaking of a conditional threat as an essential factor in coercion. The\nlargest single effort expended in analyzing coercion has been devoted\nto making sense of such threats, and determining their relationship to\ncoercion. Some, however, have questioned the linking of coercion with\nthreats, and suggested that conditional offers too can be coercive.\nBoth conditional threats and conditional offers can be said to be\nproposals, where the distinction between them is their relationship to\nsome baseline representing the coercee\u2019s situation prior to the\nproposal: compared to the baseline, threats worsen the coercee\u2019s\nsituation, while offers do not. In this and the next two sections,\nwe\u2019ll examine some of the issues involved here. In Section 2.5\nwe\u2019ll consider some approaches to coercion that attempt to\nescape from a \u201cbaseline\u201d analysis of threats and\noffers.\n\nMost will recognize the connection of coercion with threats as a\nmatter of common sense: armed robbers, mafias, the parents of young\nchildren, and the state all make conditional threats with the\nintention of reducing the eligibility of some actions, making other\nactions more attractive by comparison. Note, however, that offers may\nalso be made with the same general intention as coercive threats: that\nis, to make some actions more attractive, others less so. Consider the\nbasic structure of a conditional threat by P that attaches\nundesirable consequences C to some action A by\nQ:\n\nP claims that (P will bring about consequences\nC if and only if Q does A).\n\n\nThis proposition has the same structure as an ordinary offer by\nP to do something Q desires if Q agrees to\npay for it, but not otherwise. Conversely, any ordinary offer has the\nsame structure as a threat. This suggests that any proposal whatever\nmay be read as a threat or an offer, depending on the relationship\nbetween the proposal and some specifiable external factors.\n(\u201cYour money or your life\u201d might equally be proposed by a\nback-alley robber or a pharmaceutical company; in one case it\u2019s\na robbery, in the other case it may be a life-saving offer.) The idea\nthat threats coerce while offers don\u2019t is frequently thought to\nbe connected to the fact that threats propose to make their recipient\nworse off than she would have been otherwise. If so, we are required\nto specify how we should pick out and assess the relata in this\ncomparison, which is trickier than it may at first appear. Consider\nfirst the question of what aspect of the proposal is relevant for this\ncomparison; and then second what relevant comparison case (usually\ncalled the \u201cbaseline\u201d) should be used.\n\nAny bi-conditional proposal can be analyzed into a conjunction of two\ncomponent simple conditionals, both of which must be true if the\nbi-conditional itself is true. However, only one of the two\nconditionals will have its antecedent satisfied (depending on what\nQ chooses to do), and will thus govern what comes about as a\nconsequence. If the proposal is to have a motivational effect on its\nrecipient, it will be because the recipient prefers that one of the\ntwo possible consequents be realized \u2014 either that P\nbrings about C, or that P does not bring about\nC \u2014 so we may suppose that it is the difference in\nQ\u2019s valuation of these consequents that motivates (if\nanything does) Q to act in response to P\u2019s\nproposal. (If the agent is indifferent between the two states, we may\nconsider the proposal to be an offer, but too unattractive an offer to\ntempt one to accept it.) So we look to the conditional containing the\nless-preferred consequent, and compare it to the baseline in order to\nsee whether P\u2019s proposal makes Q worse off\nthan she would be in the relevant alternative state of affairs. (The\nfollowing analysis slightly modifies the analysis in Gorr 1986,\n391\u2013397; and Berman 2002,\n 55\u201359.[9])\n\nSo, for instance, an armed robber issues a proposal to a passerby that\namounts to the following conditionals:\n\n(a) If she keeps her valuables, he will harm her;\n\n\n(b) if she hands them over, he will not.\n\n\nThe passerby prefers the consequent in (b), so we compare the\nconditional (a) to the baseline. Normally, one faces no harm if one\nkeeps one\u2019s valuables. So the first conditional makes the\npasserby worse off than she would normally be, thus turning the\nrobber\u2019s proposal into a threat.\n\nBy contrast, consider the offer of a salesman who proposes to a\ncustomer the following:\n\n(c) If the customer pays X, he will provide her a vacation\npackage;\n\n\n(d) if she does not pay X, he provides no vacation\npackage.\n\n\nAssuming the customer would prefer having the vacation package to not\nhaving the vacation package, the second conditional contains the less\npreferred consequent. But receiving no free vacation is quite normal,\nso one is no worse off when the second conditional is operative than\nunder normal circumstances. Hence the salesman is making only an\noffer, not a threat.\n\n(Some have discussed \u201cthroffers,\u201d which are proposals that\nmake one better off than normal under one conditional, worse off than\nnormal under the alternative conditional. On the above analysis,\nthroffers will be included among the threats because the conditional\ncontaining the less-preferred consequent makes one worse off than one\nnormally would be.)\n\nThis analysis works well enough for most purposes. Since we quite\noften know what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s not, threats and\noffers are usually easily distinguished. Difficulties arise, however,\nwhen this is not the case.\n",
