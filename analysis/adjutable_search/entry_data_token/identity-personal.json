The Problems of Personal Identity\n\nThere is no single problem of personal identity, but rather a wide\nrange of questions that are at best loosely connected and not always\ndistinguished. Here are the most familiar:\n\nCharacterization. Outside of philosophy, the term\n\u2018personal identity\u2019 commonly refers to properties to which\nwe feel a special sense of attachment or ownership. My personal\nidentity in this sense consists of those properties I take to\n\u201cdefine me as a person\u201d or \u201cmake me the person I\nam\u201d. (The precise meaning of these phrases is hard to pin down.)\nTo have an \u201cidentity crisis\u201d is to become unsure of what\nmy most characteristic properties are\u2014of what sort of person I\nam in some deep and fundamental sense. This individual personal\nidentity contrasts with my gender, ethnic, and national identity,\nwhich consist roughly of the sex, ethnic group, or nation I take\nmyself to belong to and the importance I attach to this.\n\nSomeone\u2019s personal identity in this sense is contingent and\ntemporary: the way I define myself as a person might have been\ndifferent, and can vary from one time to another. It is a subset,\nusually a small one, of the properties someone has: it could happen\nthat being a philosopher and a parent belong to my identity but not\nbeing a man or a cyclist, while someone else has the same four\nproperties but feels differently towards them, so that being a man and\na cyclist belong to his identity but not being a philosopher or a\nparent. Someone may not even need to have the properties\nbelonging to her identity: if I become convinced that I am Napoleon,\nbeing an emperor could be one of the properties central to the way I\ndefine myself and thus part of my identity, even though the belief is\nfalse.\n\nWhat determines someone\u2019s personal identity in this sense is\nsometimes called the characterization question (Schechtman\n1996: 1). It asks, in the expectation of a deep and revealing\npsychological answer, Who am I? (Glover 1988: part 2 and Ludwig 1997\nare useful discussions.)\n\nPersonhood. What is it to be a person, as opposed to\na nonperson? What have we people got that nonpeople haven\u2019t got?\nThe question often arises in connection with specific cases: we may\nask, for example, at what point in our development from a fertilized\negg there comes to be a person, or what it would take for a chimpanzee\nor a Martian or a computer to be a person, if they could ever be. An\nideal account of personhood would be a definition of the word\n\u2018person\u2019, filling the blanks in the formula\n\u2018Necessarily, x is a person at time t if and\nonly if \u2026 x \u2026 t \u2026\u2019.\n\nThe most common answer is that to be a person is to have certain\nspecial mental properties. Locke, for instance, said that a person is\n\u201ca thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection,\nand can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in\ndifferent times and places\u201d (1975: 335; Baker 2000: ch. 3 is a\ndetailed account of this sort). Others propose a less direct\nconnection between personhood and these special mental properties: for\nexample that to be a person is be capable of acquiring them (Chisholm\n1976: 136f.), or to belong to a kind whose members typically have them\nwhen healthy and mature (Wiggins 1980: ch. 6). (A very different\nanswer is mentioned in section 6.)\n\nPersistence. What does it take for a person to\npersist from one time to another\u2014to continue existing rather\nthan cease to exist? What sorts of things is it possible, in the\nbroadest sense of the word \u2018possible\u2019, for you to survive,\nand what sort of event would necessarily bring your existence to an\nend? What determines which past or future being is you? Suppose you\npoint to a child in an old class photograph and say,\n\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d What makes you that one rather than one\nof the others? What is it about the way she relates then to you as you\nare now that makes her you? For that matter, what makes it the case\nthat anyone at all existing back then is you? This is sometimes called\nthe question of personal identity over time, as it has to do\nwith whether the earlier and the later being are one thing or\ntwo\u2014that is, whether they are numerically identical. An answer\nto it is an account of our persistence conditions.\n\nHistorically this question often arises from the thought that we might\ncontinue existing after we die (as in Plato\u2019s Phaedo).\nWhether this could happen depends on whether biological death\nnecessarily brings our existence to an end. Imagine that after your\ndeath there really will be someone, in this world or the next, who\nresembles you in certain ways. How would she have to relate to you as\nyou are now in order to be you, rather than someone else?\nWhat would the Higher Powers have to do to keep you in existence after\nyour death? Or is it even possible? The answer to these questions\ndepends on the answer to the persistence question.\n\nEvidence. How do we find out who is who? What\nevidence bears on the question of whether the person here now is the\none who was here yesterday? One source of evidence is first-person\nmemory: if you remember doing some particular action (or seem to), and\nsomeone really did do it, this supports the claim that that person is\nyou. Another source is physical resemblance: if the person who did it\nlooks just like you\u2014or better, if she is in some way physically\nor spatio-temporally continuous with you\u2014that too supports her\nbeing you. Which of these sources is more fundamental? Does\nfirst-person memory count as evidence all by itself, or only insofar\nas we can check it against physical facts? What should we do when\nthese considerations support opposing verdicts?\n\nSuppose Charlie\u2019s memories are erased and replaced with accurate\nmemories (or apparent memories) of the life of someone long\ndead\u2014Guy Fawkes, say (Williams 1956\u20137). Ought we to\nconclude on these grounds that the resulting person is not actually\nCharlie, but Guy Fawkes brought back to life? Or should we instead\ninfer on the basis of physical continuity that he\u2019s just Charlie\nwith different memories? What principle would answer this\nquestion?\n\nThe evidence question dominated the anglophone literature on personal\nidentity from the 1950s to the 1970s (Shoemaker 1963, 1970 and\nPenelhum 1967 are good examples). It\u2019s important to distinguish\nit from the persistence question. What it takes for you to persist\nthrough time is one thing; how we ought to evaluate the relevant\nevidence is another. If the criminal had fingerprints just like yours,\nthe courts may rightly conclude that he is you, but having your\nfingerprints is not what it is for a past or future being to\nbe you: it\u2019s neither necessary (you could survive without any\nfingers at all) nor sufficient (someone else could have fingerprints\njust like yours).\n\nPopulation. If the persistence question is about\nwhich of the characters introduced at the beginning of a story have\nsurvived till the end of it, we may also ask how many are on the stage\nat any one time. What determines how many of us there are right now?\nIf there are eight billion people on the earth at present, what\nfacts\u2014biological, psychological, or what have you\u2014make\nthat the right number?\n\nYou may think the number of people at any given time (or at least the\nnumber of human people) is simply the number of human\norganisms there are then. But this is disputed. Some say that cutting\nthe main connections between the cerebral hemispheres results in\nradical disunity of consciousness so that two people share a single\norganism (Nagel 1971; for skeptical views see Wilkes 1988: ch. 5 and\nvan Inwagen 1990: 188\u2013212). Others say that a human being with\nmultiple personality could literally be the home of two or more\nthinking beings (Wilkes 1988: 127f., Rovane 1998: 169ff.; see also\nOlson 2003, Snowdon 2014: ch. 7). Still others argue that two people\ncan share an organism in cases of conjoined twinning (Campbell and\nMcMahan 2016; see also Olson 2014).\n\nThe population question is sometimes called the problem of\n\u201csynchronic identity\u201d, as opposed to the \u201cdiachronic\nidentity\u201d of the persistence question; but these terms need\ncareful handling. They are apt to give the mistaken impression that\nidentity comes in two kinds, synchronic and diachronic. The truth is\nsimply that there are two kinds of situations where we can ask how\nmany people (or other things) there are: those involving just one\nmoment and those involving several. To make matters worse, the term\n\u2018synchronic identity\u2019 is sometimes used to express the\npersonhood question.\n\nPersonal ontology. What are we? What properties of\nmetaphysical importance do we human people have, in addition to the\nmental properties that make us people? What, for instance, are we made\nof? Are we composed entirely of matter, as stones are, or are we\npartly or wholly immaterial? Where do our spatial boundaries lie, if\nwe are spatially extended at all? Do we extend all the way out to our\nskin? If so, what fixes those boundaries? Do we have temporal as well\nas spatial parts? Are we substances\u2014metaphysically independent\nbeings\u2014or is each of us a state or an activity of something\nelse?\n\nHere are some of the main proposed accounts of what we are (Olson\n2007):\n\nWe are biological organisms (\u201canimalism\u201d: van Inwagen\n1990, Olson 1997, 2003a).\nWe are material things \u201cconstituted by\u201d organisms: a\nperson is made of the same matter as a certain animal, but they are\ndifferent things because what it takes for them to persist is\ndifferent (Baker 2000, Johnston 2007, Shoemaker 2011).\nWe are temporal parts of animals: each of us stands to an organism\nas your childhood stands to your life as a whole (Lewis 1976).\nWe are spatial parts of animals: something like brains, perhaps\n(Campbell and McMahan 2016, Parfit 2012), or temporal parts of brains\n(Hudson 2001, 2007).\nWe are partless immaterial substances\u2014souls\u2014as Plato,\nDescartes, and Leibniz thought (Unger 2006: ch. 7), or compound things\nmade up of an immaterial soul and a biological organism (Swinburne\n1984: 21).\nWe are collections of mental states or events: \u201cbundles of\nperceptions\u201d, as Hume said (1978 [1739]: 252; see also Quinton\n1962, Campbell 2006).\nThere is nothing that we are: we don\u2019t really exist at all\n(Russell 1985: 50, Unger 1979, Sider 2013).\n\n\nThere is no consensus or even a dominant view on this question.\n\nWhat matters in survival. What is the practical\nimportance of facts about our persistence? Why does it\nmatter? If you had to choose between continuing to exist or\nbeing annihilated and replaced by someone else exactly like you, what\nreason would you have to prefer one over the other? And what reason do\nyou have to care about what will happen to you, as opposed to what\nwill happen to other people? Or is there any such reason? Imagine that\nsurgeons are going to put your brain into my head and that neither of\nus has any choice about this. The resulting person will be in terrible\npain after the operation unless one of us pays a large sum in advance.\nIf we were both entirely selfish, which of us would have a reason to\npay? Will the resulting person\u2014who will think he is you\u2014be\nresponsible for your actions or for mine? (Or both, or neither?) These\nquestions are summarized in the phrase what matters in\nsurvival.\n\nThe answer may seem to turn entirely on whether the resulting person\nwould be you or I. Only I can be responsible for my\nactions. The fact that some person is me, by itself, gives me a reason\nto care about him. Each person has a special, selfish interest in her\nown future and no one else\u2019s. Identity itself (numerical\nidentity) is what matters in survival. But some say that I could have\nan entirely selfish reason to care about someone else\u2019s future\nfor his own sake. Perhaps what gives me a reason to care about what\nhappens to the man people will call by my name tomorrow is not that he\nis me, but that he is then psychologically continuous with me\nas I am now (see Section 4). If someone else were psychologically\ncontinuous tomorrow with me as I am now, he would have what\nmatters to me and I ought to transfer my selfish concern to him.\nLikewise, someone else could be responsible for my actions, and not\nfor his own. Identity itself has no practical importance. (Sosa (1990)\nand Merricks (2022) argue for the importance of identity; Parfit\n(1971, 1984: 215, 1995) and Martin (1998) argue against.)\n\nThat completes our survey. Though some of these questions may bear on\nothers, they are to a large extent independent. Many discussions of\npersonal identity leave it unclear which one is at stake.\n2. Understanding the Persistence Question\n\nTurn now to the persistence question. Few concepts have led to more\nmisunderstanding than identity over time. The persistence question is\noften confused with others or stated in a tendentious way.\n\nIt asks roughly what is necessary and sufficient for a past or future\nbeing to be someone existing now. If we point to you now, then\ndescribe someone or something existing at another time, we can ask\nwhether we are referring twice to one thing or once to each of two\nthings. The persistence question is what determines the answer to such\nqueries. (And there are precisely analogous questions about the\npersistence of other things, such as dogs or stones.)\n\nHere are three common misunderstandings of this question. Some take it\nto ask what it means to say that a past or future being is\nyou. This would imply that we can answer it simply by reflecting on\nour linguistic knowledge\u2014on what we mean by the word\n\u2018person\u2019, for example. The answer would be knowable a\npriori. It would also imply that necessarily all people have the same\npersistence conditions\u2014that the answer to the question is the\nsame no matter what sort of people we considered. Though some endorse\nthese claims (Noonan 2019b: 84\u201393), they are disputed. What it takes\nfor us to persist might depend on whether we are biological organisms,\nwhich we cannot know a priori. And if there could be immaterial\npeople\u2014gods or angels, say\u2014what it takes for them to\npersist might differ from what it takes for a human person to persist.\nIn that case our persistence conditions could not be established by\nlinguistic or conceptual analysis.\n\nSecond, the persistence question is often confused with the question\nof what it takes for someone to remain the same person (as in\nthis passage by Bertrand Russell (1957: 70): \u201cBefore we can\nprofitably discuss whether we shall continue to exist after death, it\nis well to be clear as to the sense in which a man is the same person\nas he was yesterday.\u201d) If Baffles were to change in certain\nways\u2014if she lost much of her memory, say, or changed\ndramatically in character, or became severely disabled\u2014we might\nask whether she would still be the person she was before, or instead\nbecome a different person. This is not a question about\npersistence\u2014about numerical identity over time. To ask whether\nBaffles is the same person that she was before, or to say\nthat she is a different person from the one she used to be,\npresupposes that she herself existed at the earlier time. The question\narises only when numerical identity is assumed. To ask about\nBaffles\u2019 persistence, by contrast, is to ask not whether she has\ncontinued to be the same person, but whether she has continued to\nexist at all.\n\nWhen we speak of someone\u2019s remaining the same person or becoming\na different one, we mean remaining or ceasing to be a certain\nsort of person. For someone no longer to be the same person\nis for her still to exist, but to have changed in some important way.\nThis typically has to do with her individual identity in the sense of\nthe characterization question\u2014with changes in respect of those\nproperties that \u201cdefine someone as a person.\u201d\n\nThird, the persistence question is often taken to ask what it takes\nfor the same person to exist at two different times. The most common\nformulation is something like this:\n\nIf a person x exists at one time and a person y\nexists at another time, under what possible circumstances is it the\ncase that x is y?\n\n\nThis asks, in effect, what it takes for a past or future person to be\nyou, or for you to continue existing as a person. We have a\nperson existing at one time and a person existing at another, and the\nquestion is what is necessary and sufficient for them to be one person\nrather than two.\n\nThis is narrower than the persistence question. We may want to know\nwhether each of us was ever an embryo, or whether we could survive in\nan irreversible vegetative state (where the resulting being is\nbiologically alive but has no mental properties). These are clearly\nquestions about what it takes for us to persist. But as personhood is\nmost commonly defined (recall Locke\u2019s definition quoted\nearlier), something is a person at a given time only if it has certain\nspecial mental properties at that time. Embryos and human beings in a\nvegetative state, having no mental properties at all, are thus not\npeople when they\u2019re in that condition. And in that case we\ncannot infer anything about whether you were once an embryo or could\nexist in a vegetative state from a principle about what it takes for a\npast or future person to be you.\n\nWe can illustrate the point by considering this answer to question\n1:\n\nNecessarily, a person x existing at one time is a person\ny existing at another time if and only if x can, at\nthe first time, remember an experience y has at the second\ntime, or vice versa.\n\n\nThat is, a past or future person is you just if you (who are now a\nperson) can now remember an experience she had then, or she can then\nremember an experience you\u2019re having now. Call this the\nmemory criterion. (It too is often attributed to Locke,\nthough it\u2019s uncertain whether he actually held it: see Behan\n1979.)\n\nThe memory criterion may seem to imply that if you were to lapse into\nan irreversible vegetative state, you would cease to exist (or perhaps\npass to the next world): the resulting being could not be you because\nit would not remember anything. But no such conclusion follows.\nAssuming that an organism in a vegetative state is not a person, this\nis not a case involving a person existing at one time and a person\nexisting at another time. The memory criterion can only tell us which\npast or future person you are, not which past or future being\ngenerally. It says what it takes for someone to persist as a\nperson, but not what it takes for someone to persist without\nqualification. So it implies nothing about whether you could exist in\na vegetative state or even as a corpse, or whether you were once an\nembryo. As stated, it\u2019s compatible with your surviving with no\nmemory continuity at all, as long as this happens when you are not a\nperson (Olson 1997: 22\u201326, Mackie 1999: 224\u2013228).\n\nNo advocate of the memory criterion would accept this. The view is\nintended to imply that if a person x exists now and a being\ny exists at another time\u2014whether or not it\u2019s a\nperson then\u2014they are one just if x can now remember an\nexperience y has at the other time or vice versa. But this\nnot an answer to Question 1: what it takes for a person existing at\none time and a person existing at another time to be one rather than\ntwo. It\u2019s an answer to a more general question: what it takes\nfor something that is a person at one time to exist at another time as\nwell, whether or not it\u2019s a person then:\n\nIf a person x exists at one time and something y\nexists at another time, under what possible circumstances is it the\ncase that x is y?\n\n\nThose who ask Question 1 are commonly assuming that every person is a\nperson essentially: nothing that is in fact a person could\npossibly exist without being a person. (By contrast, no student is a\nstudent essentially: something that is in fact a student can exist\nwithout being a student.) This claim, \u201cperson\nessentialism,\u201d implies that whatever is a person at one time\nmust be a person at every time when she exists, making Questions 1 and\n2 equivalent.\n\nBut person essentialism is controversial (Olson and Witt 2020).\nCombined with a Lockean account of personhood, it implies that you\nwere never an embryo: at best you may have come into being when the\nembryo that gave rise to you developed certain mental capacities. Nor\ncould you exist in a vegetative state. It rules out the brute-physical\nview described in the next section. Whether we were once embryos or\ncould exist in a vegetative state, or whether we are people\nessentially, would seem to be substantive questions that an account of\nour persistence should answer, not matters to be presupposed in the\nway we frame the debate.\n3. Accounts of Our Persistence\n\nThree main sorts of answers to the persistence question have been\nproposed. Psychological-continuity views say that our\npersistence consists in some psychological relation, the memory\ncriterion mentioned earlier being an example. You are that future\nbeing that in some sense inherits its mental features from\nyou\u2014beliefs, memories, preferences, the capacity for rational\nthought, and so on\u2014and you are that past being whose mental\nfeatures you have inherited in this way. There is dispute over what\nsort of inheritance this has to be\u2014whether it must be\nunderpinned by some kind of physical continuity, for instance, and\nwhether it requires a \u201cnon-branching\u201d\nrestriction\u2014and about what mental features need to be inherited.\n(We will return to some of these points.) But most philosophers\nwriting on personal identity since the early 20th century have\nendorsed some version of this view: e.g. Dainton 2008, Hudson (2001,\n2007), Johnston (1987, 2016), Lewis (1976), Nagel (1986: 40), Parfit\n(1971; 1984: 207; 2012), Shoemaker (1970; 1984: 90; 1997; 1999, 2008,\n2011), Unger (1990: ch. 5; 2000).\n\nA second answer is that our persistence consists in a physical\nrelation not involving psychology: you are that past or future being\nthat has your body, or that is the same biological organism as you\nare, or the like. Call these brute-physical views. (Advocates\ninclude Ayers (1990: 278\u2013292), Carter (1989), Olson (1997),\nSnowdon (2014), van Inwagen (1990: 142\u2013188), and Williams\n(1956\u20137, 1970).)\n\nSome try to combine these views, saying that we need both mental and\nphysical continuity to survive, or that either would suffice without\nthe other (Nozick 1981: ch. 1, Langford 2014, Madden 2016, Noonan\n2021).\n\nBoth views agree that there is something that it takes for us to\npersist\u2014that there are informative, nontrivial, necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a person existing at one time to exist at\nanother time. A third view, anticriterialism, denies this.\nPsychological and physical continuity are evidence for persistence, it\nsays, but do not always guarantee it and may not be required. The\nclearest advocate of this view is Merricks (1998; see also Swinburne\n1984, Lowe 1996: 41ff., 2012; Langford 2017; for criticism see\nZimmerman 1998, Shoemaker 2012). There is also debate about how\nanticriterialism should be understood (Olson 2012, Noonan 2011,\n2019a).\n4. Psychological-Continuity Views\n\nMost people\u2014most Western philosophy teachers and students,\nanyway\u2014feel immediately drawn to psychological-continuity views.\nIf your brain were transplanted, and that organ carried with it your\nmemories and other mental features, the resulting person would be\nconvinced that he or she was you. This can make it easy to suppose\nthat she would be you, and this would be so because of her\npsychological relation to you. But there is no easy path from this\nthought to an attractive answer to the persistence question.\n\nWhat psychological relation might it be? We have already mentioned\nmemory: a past or future being might be you just if you can now\nremember an experience she had then or vice versa. This proposal faces\ntwo historical objections, dating to Sergeant and Berkeley in the 18th\ncentury (see Behan 1979) but more famously discussed by Reid and\nButler (see the snippets in Perry 1975).\n\nFirst, suppose a young student is fined for overdue library books, and\nas a middle-aged lawyer remembers paying the fine. In her dotage,\nhowever, she remembers her law career but has entirely forgotten not\nonly paying the fine but all the other events of her youth. According\nto the memory criterion the young student is the middle-aged lawyer,\nthe lawyer is the elderly woman, but the elderly woman is not the\nyoung student. This is an impossible result: if x and\ny are one and y and z are one, x\nand z cannot be two. Identity is transitive; memory\ncontinuity is not.\n\nSecond, it seems to belong to the very idea of remembering that you\ncan remember only your own experiences. To remember paying a fine (or\nthe experience of it) is to remember yourself paying. That\nmakes it uninformative to say that you are the person whose\nexperiences you can remember\u2014that memory continuity is\nsufficient for us to persist. It\u2019s uninformative because we\ncould not know whether someone genuinely remembers a past experience\nwithout already knowing whether she is the one who had it. Suppose we\nask whether Blott, who exists now, is the same as Clott, whom we know\nto have existed at some past time. The memory criterion tells us that\nBlott is Clott just if Blott can now remember an experience Clott had\nthen. But Blott\u2019s seeming to remember one of Clott\u2019s\nexperiences counts as genuine memory only if Blott actually is Clott.\nSo we should already have to know whether Blott is Clott before we\ncould apply the principle that is supposed to tell us whether she is.\n(There is, however, nothing uninformative about the claim that memory\nconnections are necessary for us to persist\u2014that you\ncannot survive in a condition in which you are unable to remember\nanything, for example.)\n\nOne response to the first problem (about transitivity) is to modify\nthe memory criterion by switching from direct to indirect memory\nconnections: the old woman is the young student because she can recall\nexperiences the lawyer had at a time when the lawyer remembered the\nstudent\u2019s life. The second problem is commonly met by replacing\nmemory with \u201cquasi-memory\u201d, which is just like memory but\nwithout the identity requirement: even if it\u2019s impossible to\nremember doing something you didn\u2019t do but someone else did, you\ncould still \u201cquasi-remember\u201d it (Penelhum 1970: 85ff.,\nShoemaker 1970; for criticism see McDowell 1997).\n\nBut there remains the obvious problem that there are many times in our\npasts that we cannot remember or quasi-remember at all, and to which\nwe are not linked even indirectly by an overlapping chain of memories.\nThere is no time when you could recall anything that happened to you\nwhile you dreamlessly slept last night. The memory criterion has the\nabsurd implication that you have never existed at any time when you\nwere unconscious, and that the person sleeping in your bed last night\nwas someone else.\n\nA better solution replaces memory with the more general notion of\ncausal dependence (Shoemaker 1984, 89ff.). We can define two notions,\npsychological connectedness and psychological continuity. A being is\npsychologically connected, at some future time, with you as\nyou are now just if she is in the psychological states she is in then\nin large part because of the psychological states you are in\nnow (and this causal link is of the right sort: see Shoemaker 1979).\nHaving a current memory (or quasi-memory) of an earlier experience is\none sort of psychological connection\u2014the experience causes the\nmemory of it\u2014but there are others. The important point is that\nour current mental states can be caused in part by mental states we\nwere in at times when we were unconscious. For example, most of your\ncurrent beliefs are the same ones you had while you slept last night:\nthey have caused themselves to continue existing. You are then\npsychologically continuous, now, with a past or future being\njust if some of your current mental states relate to those he or she\nis in then by a chain of psychological connections.\n\nThat would enable us to say that a person x who exists at one\ntime is the same thing as something y existing at another\ntime just if x is, at the one time, psychologically\ncontinuous with y as it is at the other time. This avoids the\nmost obvious objections to the memory criterion.\n\nIt still leaves important questions unanswered, however. Suppose we\ncould somehow copy all the mental contents of your brain to mine, much\nas we can copy the contents of one computer drive to another, thereby\nerasing the previous contents of both brains. Whether this would be a\ncase of psychological continuity depends on what sort of causal\ndependence counts. The resulting being (with my brain and your mental\ncontents) would be mentally as you were before, and not as I was. He\nwould have inherited your mental properties in a way\u2014but a funny\none. Is it the right way? Could you literally move from one organism\nto another by \u201cbrain-state transfer\u201d?\nPsychological-continuity theorists disagree. (Shoemaker (1984:\n108\u2013111, 1997) says yes; Unger (1990: 67\u201371) says no; see\nalso van Inwagen 1997.)\n5. Fission\n\nA more serious worry for psychological-continuity views is that you\ncould be psychologically continuous with two past or future people at\nonce. If your cerebrum\u2014the upper part of the brain largely\nresponsible for mental features\u2014were transplanted, the recipient\nwould be psychologically continuous with you by anyone\u2019s lights,\nand any psychological-continuity view will imply that she would be\nyou. If we destroyed one of your cerebral hemispheres, the resulting\nbeing would also be psychologically continuous with you.\n(Hemispherectomy\u2014even the removal of the left hemisphere, which\ncontrols speech\u2014is sometimes carried out as a treatment for\nsevere epilepsy: see Shurtleff et al. 2021.) And it would be\nthe same if we did both at once, destroying one hemisphere and\ntransplanting the other: the recipient would be you on any\npsychological-continuity view.\n\nBut now suppose that both hemispheres are transplanted, each into a\ndifferent empty head. (We needn\u2019t pretend that the hemispheres\nare exactly alike.) The two recipients\u2014call them Lefty and\nRighty\u2014will each be psychologically continuous with you. The\npsychological-continuity view as we have stated it implies that any\nbeing who is psychologically continuous with you must be you. It\nfollows that you are Lefty and also that you are Righty. But that\nagain is an impossible result: if you and Lefty are one and you and\nRighty are one, Lefty and Righty cannot be two. And yet they are:\nthere are evidently two people after the operation. One thing cannot\nbe numerically identical with two different things.\n\nPsychological-continuity theorists have proposed two different\nsolutions to this problem. One, sometimes called the\n\u201cmultiple-occupancy view\u201d, says that if there is fission\nin your future, then there are two of you, so to speak, even now. What\nwe think of as you is really two people, who are now exactly similar\nand located in the same place, doing the same things and thinking the\nsame thoughts. The surgeons merely separate them (Lewis 1976, Perry\n1972, Noonan 2019b: 141\u2013144).\n\nThe multiple-occupancy view is usually combined with the general\nmetaphysical claim that people and other persisting things are\ncomposed of temporal parts (often called\n\u201cfour-dimensionalism\u201d; see Hudson 2001, Sider 2001a, Olson\n2007: ch. 5). For each person, there is, for example, such a thing as\nher first half: an entity just like the person only briefer, like the\nfirst half of a meeting. On this account, the multiple-occupancy view\nis that Lefty and Righty coincide before the operation by sharing\ntheir pre-operative temporal parts or \u201cstages\u201d, then\ndiverge by having different temporal parts located afterwards. They\nare like two roads that coincide for a stretch and then fork, sharing\nsome of their spatial parts but not others. Much as the roads are just\nlike one road where they overlap, Lefty and Righty are just like one\nperson before the operation when they share their temporal parts. Even\nthey themselves can\u2019t tell that they are two. There are two\ncoinciding people before the operation because of what happens later,\njust as there may be coinciding two roads here because of what\u2019s\nthe case elsewhere. Whether we really are composed of temporal parts,\nhowever, is disputed. (Its consequences are explored further in\nsection 8.)\n\nThe solution more commonly proposed by psychological-continuity\ntheorists abandons the claim that psychological continuity by itself\nsuffices for us to persist, and says that a past or future being is\nyou only if she is then psychologically continuous with you and no\nother being then is. (There is no circularity in this. We need\nnot know the answer to the persistence question in order to know how\nmany people there are at any one time: that comes under the population\nquestion.) So neither Lefty nor Righty is you: they both come into\nexistence when your cerebrum is divided. If both your cerebral\nhemispheres are transplanted, you cease to exist\u2014though you\nwould survive if only one were transplanted and the other destroyed.\nFission is death. (Shoemaker 1984: 85, Parfit 1984: 207; 2012: 6f.,\nUnger 1990: 265).\n\nThis proposal, the \u201cnon-branching view\u201d, has the\nsurprising consequence that if your brain is divided, you will survive\nif only one half is preserved, but you will die if both halves are.\nThat looks like the opposite of what we should expect: if your\nsurvival depends on the functioning of your brain (because\nthat\u2019s what underlies psychological continuity), then the more\nof that organ we preserve, the greater ought to be your chance of\nsurviving.\n\nIn fact the non-branching view implies that transplanting one\nhemisphere and leaving the other in place would be fatal. Its\nconsequences are especially surprising if brain-state transfer counts\nas psychological continuity: in that case, even copying your total\nbrain state to another brain without doing you any physical harm would\nkill you.\n\nThese consequences are not only hard to believe, but mysterious as\nwell. Keeping half your brain functioning is normally sufficient for\nyour survival, according to psychological-continuity views. Why then\nwould you not survive if the other half too were kept functioning,\nseparate from the first? How could an event that would normally ensure\nyour survival destroy you if accompanied by a second such event having\nno causal effect on the first (Noonan 2019b: 128\u2013141)?\n\nThe non-branching view is largely responsible for the interest in the\nquestion of what matters in identity. Faced with the prospect of\nhaving one of your hemispheres transplanted, there is no evident\nreason to want the other one to be destroyed. Most of us, it seems,\nwould rather have both preserved, even if they go into different\nheads. Yet on the non-branching view that is to prefer death over\ncontinued existence. This leads Parfit and others to say that that is\nprecisely what we ought to prefer. We have no reason to want\nto continue existing, at least for its own sake. What you have reason\nto want (assuming that your life is going well) is that there be\nsomeone in the future who is psychologically continuous with you,\nwhether or not she is you. The usual way to achieve this is to\ncontinue existing yourself, but on the non-branching view it\u2019s\nnot necessary.\n\nLikewise, even the most selfish person may have a reason to care about\nthe welfare of the beings who would result from her undergoing\nfission, whether or not either of them would be her. The non-branching\nview suggests that the sorts of practical concerns you ordinarily have\nfor yourself can apply to someone other than you. More generally,\nfacts about numerical identity\u2014about who is who\u2014have no\npractical importance. All that matters is who is psychologically\ncontinuous with whom. Psychological-continuity views are often said to\nbe superior to brute-physical views in accounting for what matters in\nidentity. Fission cases threaten this claim. (Lewis 1976 and Parfit\n1976 debate whether the multiple-occupancy view can preserve the\nconviction that identity is what matters practically.)\n6. The Too-Many-Thinkers Objection\n\nAnother objection to psychological-continuity views is that they rule\nout our being biological organisms (Carter 1989, Ayers 1990:\n278\u2013292, Snowdon 1990, Olson 1997: 80f., 100\u2013109). This is\nbecause no sort of psychological continuity appears to be either\nnecessary or sufficient for a human organism to persist.\n\nWe can see that it\u2019s not necessary by noting that each human\norganism persists as an embryo without psychological continuity. And\nwe can see that it\u2019s not sufficient by imagining that your brain\nis transplanted. In that case the recipient would be uniquely\npsychologically continuous with you, and this continuity would be\ncontinuously physically realized. Any psychological-continuity view\nimplies that she would be you. More generally, any person would go\nwith her transplanted brain. But it does not appear as if any organism\nwould go with its transplanted brain. It looks as if the operation\nwould simply move an organ from one organism to another, like\ntransplanting a liver. It follows that if you were an organism, you\nwould stay behind with an empty head, contrary to\npsychological-continuity views.\n\nPsychological-continuity views do not merely rule out our being\nessentially or \u201cfundamentally\u201d organisms, but our being\norganisms at all. They say that each person has the property of\npersisting by virtue of psychological continuity: of being such that\npsychological continuity (perhaps with a non-branching restriction) is\nboth necessary and sufficient for it to continue existing. But no\norganism has this property. (Or at least no human organism does, and\nwe are clearly not non-human organisms.) Or again: every person would\ngo with her transplanted brain, but no organism would do so. And if\nevery person has a property that no organism has, then no person is an\norganism.\n\nThat is said to be a problem for psychological-continuity views\nbecause healthy, adult human organisms appear to be conscious and\nintelligent. Suppose they are. And suppose, as\npsychological-continuity views appear to imply, that we ourselves are\nnot organisms. Three awkward consequences follow.\n\nFirst, you are one of two intelligent beings sitting there and reading\nthis entry: there is, in addition to you, an organism reading it. More\ngenerally, there are two thinking beings wherever we thought there was\njust one, a person and an organism distinct from it.\n\nSecond, we would expect the organism not just to be intelligent, but\nto be psychologically indistinguishable from you. That would make it a\nperson, if being a person amounts to having mental special properties\n(as on Locke\u2019s definition)\u2014a second person in addition to\nyou. In that case it cannot be true that all people (or even\nall human people) persist by virtue of psychological continuity,\ncontrary to psychological-continuity views. Some\u2014those who are\norganisms\u2014would have brute-physical persistence conditions.\n\nThird, it\u2019s hard to see how you could know whether you yourself\nwere the nonanimal person with psychological persistence conditions or\nthe animal person with brute-physical ones. If you thought you were\nthe nonanimal, the organism would use the same reasoning to conclude\nthat it was too. For all you could ever know, it seems, you\nmight be the one making this mistake.\n\nWe can illustrate the nature of this epistemic problem by imagining a\nthree-dimensional duplicating machine. When you step into the\n\u201cin\u201d box, it reads off your complete physical (and mental)\ncondition and uses this information to assemble a perfect duplicate of\nyou in the \u201cout\u201d box. The process causes momentary\nunconsciousness but is otherwise harmless. Two beings wake up, one in\neach box. The boxes are indistinguishable. Because each being will\nhave the same apparent memories and perceive identical surroundings,\neach will think, for the same reasons, that he or she is you\u2014but\nonly one will be right. If this happened to you, it\u2019s hard to\nsee how you could know, afterwards, whether you were the original or\nthe duplicate. (Suppose the technicians who work the machine are sworn\nto secrecy and immune to bribes.) You would think, \u201cWho am I?\nDid I do the things I seem to remember doing, or did I come into being\nonly a moment ago, complete with false memories of someone\nelse\u2019s life?\u201d And you would have no way of answering these\nquestions. In the same way, psychological-continuity views raise the\nquestions, \u201cWhat am I? Am I a nonanimal that would go with its\nbrain if that organ were transplanted, or an animal that would stay\nbehind with an empty head?\u201d And here too there seem to be no\ngrounds on which to answer them.\n\nThis is the \u201ctoo-many-thinkers\u201d or\n\u201cthinking-animal\u201d objection to psychological-continuity\nviews. The most popular defense against it is to say that, despite\nsharing our brains and showing all the outward signs of consciousness\nand intelligence, human organisms do not think and are not conscious.\nThere simply are no thinking animals to create problems for\npsychological-continuity views (Shoemaker 1984: 92\u201397, Lowe\n1996: 1, Johnston 2007: 55; Baker 2000 offers a more complex\nvariant).\n\nBut although this is easy to say, it\u2019s hard to defend. If human\norganisms cannot be conscious and intelligent, it would seem to follow\nthat no biological organism could have any mental properties at all.\nThis threatens to imply that human organisms are \u201czombies\u201d\nin the philosophical sense: beings physically identical to conscious\nbeings, with the same behavior, but lacking consciousness (Olson\n2018). And it leaves us wondering why organisms cannot be\nconscious. The best proposed answer is given by Shoemaker (1999, 2008,\n2011), who argues that it is because organisms have the wrong\npersistence conditions, but it\u2019s highly controversial.\n\nA second option is to concede that human organisms are psychologically\nindistinguishable from us, but try to explain how we can still know\nthat we are not those organisms. The best-known proposal of this sort\nfocuses on personhood and first-person reference. It says that not\njust any being with mental properties of the sort that you and I\nhave\u2014rationality and self-consciousness, for\ninstance\u2014counts as a person (contrary to anything like\nLocke\u2019s definition). A person must also persist by virtue of\npsychological continuity. It follows that human animals are not people\n(thus avoiding the second awkward consequence, about personhood).\n\nFurther, personal pronouns such as \u2018I\u2019, and the thoughts\nthey express, refer only to people in this sense. So when your animal\nbody says or thinks \u2018I\u2019, it refers not to itself but to\nyou, the person. The organism\u2019s statement \u2018I am a\nperson\u2019 does not express the false belief that it is a\nperson, but the true belief that you are. So the organism is not\nmistaken about which thing it is: it has no first-person beliefs about\nitself at all. And you\u2019re not mistaken either. You can infer\nthat you are a person from the linguistic facts that you are whatever\nyou refer to when you say \u2018I\u2019, and that \u2018I\u2019\nnever refers to anything but a person. You can know that you are not\nthe animal thinking your thoughts because it is not a person and\npersonal pronouns never refer to nonpeople (thus avoiding the third,\nepistemic consequence; see Noonan 1998, 2010, Olson 2002; for a\ndifferent approach see Brueckner and Buford 2009).\n\nThe too-many-thinkers problem arises on the assumption that we are not\norganisms, which appears to follow from psychological-continuity views\nbecause organisms don\u2019t seem to persist by virtue of\npsychological continuity. But some say that human organisms do persist\nby virtue of psychological continuity. Although you are an organism,\nthe transplant operation would not move your brain from one organism\nto another, but would cut an organism down to the size of a brain,\nmove it across the room, and then give it new parts to replace the\nones it lost. The view is sometimes called \u201cnew animalism\u201d\n(Madden 2016, Noonan 2021; see also Langford 2014, Olson 2015:\n102\u2013106).\n7. Animalism and Brute-Physical Views\n\nAnimalism says that we human people are organisms. This does not imply\nthat all organisms, or even all human organisms, are people: as we saw\nearlier, human embryos and animals in a vegetative state are not\npeople on the most common definitions of that term. Being a person may\nbe only a temporary property of us, like being a student. Nor does it\nimply that all people are organisms: it is consistent with there being\nwholly inorganic people such as gods or intelligent robots. Animalism\nis not an answer to the personhood question. (It is consistent, for\ninstance, with Locke\u2019s definition of \u2018person\u2019.)\n\nThe dominant view among both animalists and their opponents is that\norganisms persist by virtue of some sort of brute-physical continuity\nwith no psychological element. So most animalists accept a\nbrute-physical account of our persistence. And most advocates of\nbrute-physical views take us to be organisms. This suggests that we\nhave the same persistence conditions as certain nonpeople, such as\noysters. And our persistence conditions differ from those of\nimmaterial people, if there could be such things, so that there are no\npersistence conditions for people as such. Though some object to this\n(Baker 2000: 124), many psychological-continuity theorists say that\nall beings with mental properties have the same persistence conditions\n(Shoemaker 2008, Unger 2000), which has the same implication.\n\nThe most common objection to brute-physical views (and, by extension,\nto animalism) focuses on their implication that transplanting your\nbrain into my head would not give you a new body, but would give me a\nnew brain. You would stay behind with an empty head (e.g. Unger 2000;\nfor an important related objection see Johnston 2007, 2016).\nAnimalists generally concede that this is counterintuitive, but take\nthis fact to be outweighed by other considerations: that we appear to\nbe organisms, for example, that it\u2019s hard to say what sort of\nnonorganisms we might be, and that our being organisms would\navoid the too-many-thinkers problem. And animalism is compatible with\nour beliefs about who is who in real life: every actual case in which\nwe take someone to survive or perish is a case where a human organism\ndoes so. Psychological-continuity views, by contrast, conflict with\nthe appearance that each of us was once a foetus. When we see an\nultrasound picture of a 12-week-old foetus, we ordinarily think\nwe\u2019re seeing something that will, if all goes well, be born,\nlearn to speak, and eventually become an adult human person, yet no\nperson is in any way psychologically continuous with a 12-week-old\nfoetus.\n\nAnd the \u201ctransplant objection\u201d may be less compelling than\nit first appears (Snowdon 2014: 234). Suppose you had a tumor that\nwould kill you unless your brain were replaced with a healthy donated\norgan. This would have grave side-effects: it would destroy your\nmemories, plans, preferences, and other mental properties. It may not\nbe clear whether you could survive it, even if the operation were\nsuccessful. But is it really obvious that you could not\nsurvive it? Maybe it could save your life, though at great cost. And\nthis might be so, the argument goes, even if the new brain gave you\nmemories, plans, and preferences from the donor. But if it\u2019s not\nobvious that the brain recipient would not be you, then it\u2019s not\nobvious that it would be the donor. A brain transplant might be\nmetaphysically analogous to a liver transplant. Again, the claim is\nnot that this is obviously true, but only that it\u2019s not\nobviously false. And in that case it\u2019s not obvious that a person\nmust go with her transplanted brain. (Williams 1970 argues in a\nsimilar way.)\n8. Wider Themes\n\nThe debate between psychological-continuity and brute-physical views\ncannot be settled without considering more general matters outside of\npersonal identity. For instance, psychological-continuity theorists\nneed to explain why human organisms are unable to think as we do. This\nwill require an account of the nature of mental properties. Or if\nhuman organisms can think, psychological-continuity theorists\nwill want an account of how we can know that we are not those\norganisms. This will turn on how the reference of personal pronouns\nand proper names works, or on the nature of knowledge.\n\nSome general metaphysical views suggest that there is no unique right\nanswer to the persistence question. The best-known example is the\nontology of temporal parts mentioned in section 5. It says that for\nevery period of time when you exist, short or long, there is a\ntemporal part of you that exists only then. This gives us many likely\ncandidates for being you\u2014that is, many different beings now\nsitting there and reading this. Suppose you are a material thing, and\nthat we know what determines your spatial boundaries. That should tell\nus what counts as your current temporal part or\n\u201cstage\u201d\u2014the temporal part of you located now and at\nno other time. But that stage is a part of a vast number of temporally\nextended objects (Hudson 2001: ch. 4).\n\nFor instance, it is a part of a being whose temporal boundaries are\ndetermined by relations of psychological continuity (Section 4) among\nits stages. That is, one of the beings thinking your current thoughts\nis an aggregate of person-stages, each of which is psychologically\ncontinuous with each of the others and with no other stage. If this is\nwhat you are, then you persist by virtue of psychological continuity.\nYour current stage is also a part of a being whose temporal boundaries\nare determined by relations of psychological connectedness.\nThat is, one of the beings now thinking your thoughts is an aggregate\nof person-stages, each of which is psychologically connected with each\nof the others and to no other stage. This may not be the same as the\nfirst being, as some stages may be psychologically continuous with\nyour current stage but not psychologically connected with it. If this\nis what you are, then psychological connectedness is necessary and\nsufficient for you to persist (Lewis 1976). What\u2019s more, your\ncurrent stage is a part of an organism, which persists by virtue of\nbrute-physical continuity, and a part of many bizarre and\ngerrymandered objects (Hirsch 1982, ch. 10). Some even say that you\nare your current stage itself (Sider 2001a, 188\u2013208). And there\nwould be many other candidates.\n\nThe temporal-parts ontology implies that each of us shares our current\nthoughts with countless beings that diverge from one another in the\npast or future. If this were true, which of these things should\nwe be? Of course, we are the things we refer to when we say\n\u2018I\u2019, or more generally the referents of our personal\npronouns and proper names. But these words would be unlikely to\nsucceed in referring to just one sort of thing\u2014to only one of\nthe many candidates on each occasion of utterance. There would\nprobably be some indeterminacy of reference, so that each such\nutterance referred ambiguously to many different candidates. That\nwould make it indeterminate what things, and even what sort of things,\nwe are. And insofar as the candidates have different histories and\ndifferent persistence conditions, it would be indeterminate when we\ncame into being and what it takes for us to persist (Sider 2001b).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ayers, M., 1990, <em>Locke</em>, vol. 2, London: Routledge.", "Baker, L.
