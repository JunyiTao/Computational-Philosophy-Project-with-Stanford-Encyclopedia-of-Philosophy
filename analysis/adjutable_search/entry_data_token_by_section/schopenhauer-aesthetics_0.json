Brief Background\n\n\nBy the 1870s, Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy had gained, in\nNietzsche\u2019s words \u201cascendency in Europe\u201d (GM\nIII, \u00a75). Indeed, late-19th and\nearly-20th century philosophers, writers, composers and\nartists such as Nietzsche, Wagner, Brahms, Freud, Wittgenstein,\nHorkheimer, Hardy, Mann, Rilke, Proust, Tolstoy, Borges, Mahler, Langer\nand Sch\u00f6nberg were influenced by Schopenhauer\u2019s\nthought.   Recognition came late in his life, however,\nstarting only in 1853 with the publication of a review article by J.\nOxenford.  Until then, Schopenhauer labored in relative obscurity,\ndespite the publication of numerous works such as: On the Fourfold\nRoot of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (his doctoral\ndissertation published in 1813, revised 1847), On Vision and\nColors (1816), his magnum opus The World as Will and\nRepresentation (1818/9; second, revised edition with a second\nvolume of essays 1844), On the Will in Nature (1836), On\nthe Freedom of the Will (which won a prize from the Royal\nNorwegian Society of Sciences in 1839), On the Basis of Morals\n(which did not win the prize from the Danish Royal Society of\nSciences despite its being the only entry for the competition), and two\nvolumes of Parerga and Paralipomena (1851).\n\n\nWhat many luminaries of European culture found gripping in\nSchopenhauer\u2019s thought was his doctrine of the world as having\ntwo aspects related to each other as two sides of the same coin: (1) an\nultimate foundation as \u201cwill\u201d\u2014a blind, purposeless urge or\nstriving akin to energy\u2014which he identified with the Kantian thing in\nitself (for competing interpretations of the argument for this\nidentification see: Atwell  1995; Janaway 1989, 1999a; Young,\n1987; DeCian & Segala 2002; Cartwright 2001; Jacquette 2007;\nShapshay 2008; and Wicks 2008); and (2) a world of\nrepresentation, i.e., the will qua thing in itself as it\n\u201cobjectifies\u201d itself and appears to human beings through\ntheir shared mode of cognitive conditioning.\n\n\nSchopenhauer held that the character of the will qua thing in\nitself\u2014blind urge\u2014expresses itself in the perpetual strivings\nof living creatures and in the forces of inorganic matter. \nGrounding his proto-Darwinian philosophy of nature in his metaphysics\nand the empirical sciences of his day, Schopenhauer viewed nature as an\narena where living beings compete to survive and procreate, where\nspecies adapt to environmental conditions, and, most emphasized by\nSchopenhauer, where sentient beings suffer  as virtual\nslaves to their will to life [Wille zum\nLeben]. \n\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s metaphysics and philosophy of nature led him to\nthe doctrine of pessimism:  the view that sentient beings, with\nfew exceptions, are bound to strive and suffer greatly, all without any\nultimate purpose or justification and thus life is not really worth\nliving. This is a view that has seldom been defended in the history of\nWestern thought and became a potent philosophical problem for\nNietzsche and atheist existentialists. \n\n\nMitigating his pessimism somewhat, Schopenhauer does see a salutary\nrole for the intellect in human life.  He identifies three main\nways in which the intellect breaks free to some degree from the\nservitude to the will and its attendant egoism: (1) in aesthetic\nexperience and artistic production, (2) in compassionate attitudes and\nactions, and (3) in ascetic resignation from embodied existence. \nIn each of these three ways of being in the world, a subject exercises\nvarying degrees of freedom from the will to life, a freedom which is\ninextricably bound up with a degree of \u201cintuitive\nknowledge\u201d of the world, or, as Wittgenstein would later put it,\nof \u201cseeing the world aright.\u201d Thus, the mode of being of\nthe aesthetic perceiver, the artist, the compassionate agent, and the\nascetic saint each has moral value in virtue of their possessing a\ndegree of true understanding of the world, which enables the attainment\nof a degree of freedom from ordinary egoism, and which leads them to\nnot add to\u2014or possibly to diminish\u2014the amount of suffering in the\nworld.\n",
