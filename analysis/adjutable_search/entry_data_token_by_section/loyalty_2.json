The nature of loyalty\n\nAs a working definition, loyalty can be characterized as a practical\ndisposition to persist in an intrinsically valued (though not\nnecessarily valuable) associational attachment, where that involves a\npotentially costly commitment to secure or at least not to jeopardize\nthe interests or well-being of the object of loyalty. For the most\npart, an association that we come to value for its own sake is also\none with which we come to identify (as mine or\nours).\n",
