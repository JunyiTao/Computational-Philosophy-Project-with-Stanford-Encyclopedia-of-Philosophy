If\n\\(b\\) is this privileged branch, then the truth-value of a\nproposition, \\(p\\), at a moment of time, \\(t\\), may be defined in\nterms of the Ockhamistic valuation function as \\(\\Ock(t,b,p)\\). We may\nspeak of \u201cthe actual future\u201d (Lucas 1989). This solution\nhas been studied in (\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 1981) and further\nelaborated and discussed in (Malpass et al. 2012) and (Borghini et al.\n2013). Consider, for instance, the following model, in which the\narrows indicate the true future at any moment.\n\n\n\n\nIn this model, \\(F(x)q\\) is true at \\(t_2\\) and \\(F(x+y)q\\) is true at\n\\(t_1\\), although none of the propositions are necessary, since\n\\(F(x){\\sim}q\\) is possible at \\(t_2\\). The reason why \\(F(x)q\\) is\ntrue at \\(t_2\\) is just that the evaluation of a proposition according\nto the true futurist theory should be based on the specified branch\nthrough \\(t_2\\) representing \u201cthe future\u201d at \\(t_2\\)\nwithin the model. However, as we shall see in the following, it turns\nout that the idea of a specified branch at every moment can be\nintegrated into the semantics in several ways. But first of all some\ncomments on the very idea of a specified branch.\n\nWhat makes the specified branch privileged? Is it just that it\nrepresents what is going to happen? Is there anything in the present\nsituation, \\(t_2\\), which makes one branch ontologically special as\nopposed to the other branches? It might be tempting to refer to some\nsort of a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d status of the privileged branch,\nsince we have no way of knowing which branch is the specified one\nrepresenting \u201cthe future\u201d except by waiting.\n\nSome authors have held that the idea of a privileged branch is\nincompatible with indeterminism. Hence Rich Thomason (1970, 1984) has\nargued that from an indeterministic point of view no special branch\ndeserves to be called the true future. Of course, the problem is what\nexactly the idea of indeterminism implies. According to MacFarlane, it\nis problematic to give one future branch a special status, if we want\nto hang on to objective indeterminism regarding the future (MacFarlane\n2003, p. 325). On the other hand, although the true futurist theory\ndoes contain some intricate notions, it has not been shown to be\ninconsistent, and a supporter of the theory may still hold that the\ntheory correctly explains what reality is like. It should be borne in\nmind that true futurist theory was introduced exactly to avoid what\nmany have held to be counter-intuitive tenets, e.g. that all future\ncontingents are false now (the Peircean view), or that they have no\nchronicle-independent truth-values now (the Ockhamistic view).\nTherefore, it should be carefully considered which approach ultimately\nleads to the fewest problems.\n\nAccording to Belnap and Green a true futurist theory should include\nthe idea that at any moment of time \u2013 including any\ncounterfactual moment \u2013 there is a true future, a so-called\n\u201cthin red line\u201d (Belnap and Green 1994), passing through\nthat moment. Formally, this means that there must be a function,\n\\(\\TRL\\), which gives the true future for any moment of time, \\(t\\).\nMore precisely, \\(\\TRL(t)\\) yields the linear past as well as the true\nfuture of \\(t\\), extended to a maximal\n set.[5]\n\nIn fact, the idea of adding a function like \\(\\TRL\\) to the semantical\nmodel had earlier been suggested by (McKim and Davis 1976) and by\n(Thomason and Gupta 1980). But unlike Belnap and Green these authors\ndid not name the function in any spectacular way.\n\nIt would of course be fatal for the true futurist theory if it could\nbe demonstrated that it contradicts assumptions which we for other\nreasons should accept. Belnap and Green (1994) have argued that there\nare in fact such fundamental problems related to the true futurist\npicture. They have argued that it is not sufficient for the model to\nspecify a preferred branch corresponding to the true history (past,\npresent, and future): it must be assumed that there is a preferred\nbranch at every counterfactual moment. They have illustrated\ntheir view using the following statement:\n\n\u201cThe coin will come up heads. It is possible, though that it\nwill come up tails, and then later it will come up tails again (though\nat this moment it could come up heads), and then, inevitably, still\nlater it will come up tails yet again.\u201d (Belnap and Green 1994,\np. 379)\n\n\nThis statement may be represented in terms of tense logic with\n\\(\\tau\\) representing tails and \\(\\eta\\) heads, respectively:\n\n\\[\nF(1)\\eta \\wedge \\Diamond F(1)(\\tau \\wedge \\Diamond F(1)\\eta \\wedge F(1)(\\tau \\wedge \\Box F(1)\\tau))\n\\]\n\n\nand in terms of the following branching time structure:\n\n\n\n\nThe example shows that if we want to take this kind of everyday\nreasoning into account, we need to be able to speak not only about the\nfuture, but also about what would be the future at any counterfactual\nmoment. As mentioned above this is formally done in terms of the\nTRL-function. But what are the constraints on this function? Belnap\nand Green have argued that:\n\n(TRL1)\n\\(t \\in \\TRL(t)\\)\n\n\nshould hold in general. Moreover, they have also maintained that:\n\n(TRL2)\n\\(t_1 \\lt t_2 \\supset \\TRL(t_1) = \\TRL(t_2)\\)\n\n\nshould hold for the TRL-function. On the other hand, they have argued\nthat the combination of (TRL1) and (TRL2) is inconsistent with the\nvery idea of branching time. The reason is that if (TRL1) and (TRL2)\nare both accepted, it follows from \\(t_1 \\lt t_2\\) that \\(t_2 \\in\n\\TRL(t_1)\\) i.e., that all moments of time after \\(t_1\\) would have to\nbelong to the thin red line through \\(t_1\\), which means that there\nwill in fact be no branching at all. However, it is very hard to see\nwhy a true futurist would have to accept (TRL2), which seems to be too\nstrong a requirement. Rather than (TRL2), the weaker condition\n(TRL2\u2032) can be employed:\n\n(TRL2\u2032)\n\\((t_1 \\lt t_2 \\wedge t_2 \\in \\TRL(t_1)) \\supset \\TRL(t_1) =\n\\TRL(t_2)\\)\n\n\nThis seems to be much more natural in relation to the notion of a true\nfuturist branching time logic. Belnap has later accepted that\n(TRL2\u2032) is a plausible alternative to (TRL2) (see Belnap et al.\n2001, p. 169).\n\n(TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032) are essential in a branching time structure\nwith a TRL-function. This may be illustrated using a discrete\ntense-logic like the one mentioned in section 2. We shall assume that\nthere are two functions, \\(\\next\\) and \\(back\\), from TIME to TIME\nsuch that \\(\\next(t)\\) is the moment just after \\(t\\) on \\(\\TRL(t)\\),\nand \\(back(t)\\) is the moment just before \\(t\\) on \\(\\TRL(t)\\). The\nsimilarity to the \u201ctomorrow\u201d \\(T(p)\\) and\n\u201cyesterday\u201d \\(Y(p)\\) of section 2 \u2013 and hence, to\nPrior\u2019s considerations in (Prior 1967) \u2013 is worth noting,\neven though the functions ranged over propositions rather than times.\nStarting from an arbitrary moment \\(t_0\\) we may define \\(t_n =\n\\next^n(t_0)\\) for \\(n = 1,2,3,\\ldots.\\) It follows from (TRL1) and\n(TRL2\u2032) that \\(\\TRL(t_0) = \\TRL(t_1) = \\TRL(t_2) =\\TRL(t_3) =\n\\ldots\\) and that \\(t_n \\in \\TRL(t_0)\\) for any \\(n\\). In other words,\nwe might have started from the functions \\(\\next\\) and \\(\\back\\) in\norder to define the function, \\(\\TRL\\). Taking \\(t_0\\) as now the\nfunction \\(\\next\\) would by iterative use constitute the elements of\nthe future part of \\(\\TRL(t_0)\\). Similarly, the past part of\n\\(\\TRL(t_0)\\), i.e., PAST\\((t_0)\\) could be established by iterative\nuse of \\(back\\), given that the branching time structure is backwards\nlinear (as mentioned in section 3). In consequence, it turns out that\nthere is a nice correspondence between a discrete branching time\nsystem defined in terms of \\(\\TRL\\) and \\(\\lt\\) on the one hand, and\non the other hand the same system defined in terms of the functions,\n\\(\\next\\) and \\(\\back\\). In this way, a study of the discrete case\nleads to an interesting illustration of the idea of the thin red line\nas well as to an emphasis of the importance of (TRL1) and\n(TRL2\u2032).\n\nIn general, we can inductively define a chronicle-independent\nvaluation function, using TRUE, which as mentioned in section\n4.2 gives a truth-value (0 or 1) for any propositional constant at any\nmoment in TIME, and using the TRL-function. On this basis, the\nvaluation function, \\(T(t,p)\\) can be defined recursively for any wff\n\\(p\\), and any moment of time \\(t\\):\n\n\n(a)\n\\(T(t, p) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\TRUE(p,t) = 1\\), where \\(p\\) is any propositional\nconstant. \n\n(b)\n\\(T(t, p\\wedge q) = 1\\)\niff\nboth \\(T(t,p) = 1\\) and \\(T(t,q) = 1\\) \n\n(c)\n\\(T(t,{\\sim}p) = 1\\)\niff\nnot \\(T(t,p) = 1\\) \n\n(d)\n\\(T(t,Pq) = 1\\)\niff\nthere is some \\(t'\\) with \\(t'\\lt t\\) and \\(T(t',q) = 1\\)\n\n\n(e)\n\\(T(t,Fq) = 1\\)\niff\nthere is some \\(t' \\in \\TRL(t)\\) with \\(t\\lt t'\\) and \\(T(t',q)\n= 1\\) \n\n\n\\(T(t,q) = 1\\) can be read \u2018\\(q\\) is true at \\(t\\)\u2019. As in\nsection 4.2 the valuation function has the range \\(\\{0,1\\}\\). A\nformula \\(q\\) is said to be T-valid if and only if \\(T(t,q) = 1\\) for\nany \\(t\\) in any branching time structure (TIME,\\(\\le\\),C), any\nvaluation function TRUE, and any TRL-function defined on\nTIME.\n\nThis means that sentences only involving tenses are what Belnap (in\nhonor of Carnap) has called \u201cmoment-determinate\u201d (Belnap\n1991, p. 163), indicating that their truth-value doesn\\('\\)t vary with\nthe chronicle. The advantage of this view is that it corresponds with\neveryday reasoning and natural language understanding as it is most\ncommonly conceived.\n\nAs in sections 4.2 and 5.1, it is possible to extend the language in\norder to take metrical notions into consideration:\n\n\n\\(T(t,P(x)q) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\exists t'{:} \\dur(t',t,x) \\amp T(t',q) = 1\\) \n\n\\(T(t,F(x)q) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\exists t'{:} \\dur(t,t',x) \\amp t' \\in \\TRL(t) \\amp T(t',q) =\n1\\) \n\n\nBelnap and Green have argued that the constraints on the TRL-function\nshould give rise to a logic in which the following theorems hold:\n\n(T1)\n\\(PPq \\supset Pq\\)\n(T2)\n\\(FFq \\supset Fq\\)\n(T3)\n\\(q \\supset PFq\\)\n\n\nIf we accept the constraints (TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032), and use the\nabove recursive definition of the valuation function \\(T(t,p)\\), we\nobtain a semantics according to which (T1) and (T2) are valid.\n\nHowever, with the semantics presented above, (T3) will not be valid.\nTo see why this is the case, consider a situation with a moment of\ntime \\(t_1\\) such that \\(t_1 \\not\\in \\TRL(t_0)\\) for any \\(t_0\\lt\nt_1\\). Assume that \\(t_1\\) is the only moment at which \\(q\\) is true.\nThen \\(PFq\\), hence also \\(q \\supset PFq\\), will be false at\n\\(t_1\\).\n\nEven the formula\n\n(T3\u2032)\n\\(q \\supset P(x)F(x)q\\)\n\n\nis false when evaluated with semantics of this kind.\n\nThe rejection of (T3\u2032) can be illustrated by the following\ndiagram, in which the arrow on the upper branch indicates the thin red\nline. (The vertical line in this diagram represents a set of\nco-temporaneous moments, i.e., what is sometimes called an\ninstant.)\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this diagram \\(q\\) holds at the counterfactual moment of\ntime, \\(t\\). However, as indicated in the diagram \\(F(x)q\\) was false\n\\(x\\) time units earlier than \\(t\\), since at that time \\(t'\\) would\nbe the true future \\(x\\) time units later.\n\nThe rejection of (T3) and (T3\u2032) is not the only problem related\nto a TRL-semantics defined in this way. It should also be pointed out\nthat it is somewhat complicated to state the semantics of modal\nexpressions if we follow this procedure, since it may involve the\nquantification over possible TRL-functions. This approach has been\nfurther investigated in (Bra\u00fcner et al. 1998).\n\nThere is, however, a simpler strategy which makes it possible to\nensure the validity of (T3) and (T3\u2032) even if one wants to\ninsist on the assumption of the thin red line. This can be done by\ndefining \u201ctrue at time \\(t\\)\u201d in terms of \u201ctrue at\ntime \\(t\\) and chronicle \\(c\\)\u201d, as it is defined in the\nOckhamist semantics: \n\n\\[\nT(t,p) = \\Ock(t, \\TRL(t),p)\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(p\\) is an arbitrary propositional expression. \\(T(t,p) = 1\\)\ncan be read \u201c\\(p\\) is true at \\(t\\)\u201d. This idea of\nobtaining a thin red line semantics by introducing a unique historical\nparameter has been discussed in (MacFarlane 2003, 330\u2013331, cf.\nn. 10).\n\nAs in Prior\u2019s Ockhamistic model it is straightforward to\nintroduce metrical tense operators in this system.\n\nAs in the Leibniz-theory we should not necessarily assume that all\nmaximal linear subsets in the branching time structure should be taken\ninto account as chronicles in the semantics. It may be reasonable to\nassume various restrictions regarding the set of chronicles and its\nuse in the semantical model. In fact, it has turned out to be\ninteresting to consider the possibilities of modifying the definition\nof \\(C(t)\\) used in (f) of the \\(Ock\\) definition in section 5.1.\n\nThe following validity definition may be suggested:\n\n(V)\nA formula \\(p\\) is said to be TRL-valid if and only if\n\\(\\Ock(t,\\TRL(t),p) = 1\\) for any \\(t\\) in any branching time\nstructure, (TIME,\\(\\le\\),C), any valuation function TRUE, any\ndefinition of \\(C(t)\\) with \\(\\TRL(t) \\in C(t)\\) and \\(C(t) \\subseteq\n\\{c \\in C\\mid t \\in c\\}\\) for all \\(t\\), and any TRL-function for which\n(TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032) hold.\n\n\nGiven this definition it is easily seen that (T1\u20133) and\n(T3\u2032) are all TRL-valid. Regarding the interplay between the\ntense operators and the modal operator, it is straightforward to\nverify that the following is TRL-valid:\n\n(T4)\n\\(F(x)p \\supset \\Diamond F(x)p\\)\n\n\nwhereas (P3) in section 2 will not be TRL-valid for propositions\ndepending on the future. However, the notion of validity suggested\nabove may also allow for the following definition of \\(C(t)\\), which\nhas been discussed in (Bra\u00fcner et al. 2000):\n\n\\(C(t) = \\{c \\mid t \\in c \\amp \\TRL(t')=c\\), for all \\(t' \\in c\\) with\n\\(t \\lt t'\\}\\) \n\nNote that with this definition (TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032) together say\nexactly that \\(\\TRL(t) \\in C(t)\\). Also note that \\(C(t)\\) may contain\nmore branches than just \\(\\TRL(t)\\).\n\nHowever, it should be mentioned that the possibility operator in this\nmodel is somewhat surprising. In the obvious metrical extension of the\nsystem the following formula is invalidated:\n\n(T5)\n\\(F(x)\\Diamond F(y)p \\supset \\Diamond F(x)F(y)p\\)\n\n\nAccording to the usual Ockhamist semantics (T5) is valid. The\nrejection of (T5) in the system presented in (Bra\u00fcner et al.\n2000) may be illustrated with reference to the following model:\n\n\n\n\nHere it is assumed that \\(\\TRL(t)=c_2\\) for all \\(t\\) on \\(c_2\\) after\n\\(t_2\\) and that \\(\\TRL(t)=c_3\\) for all \\(t\\) on \\(c_3\\) after\n\\(t_2\\). Clearly, this means that \\(C(t_2)=\\{c_2,c_3\\}\\). In\nconsequence, the proposition \\(\\Diamond F(y)p\\) holds at \\(t_2\\). This\nmeans that \\(F(x)\\Diamond F(y)p\\) is true at\n\\(t_1\\). However, the proposition \\(\\Diamond F(x)F(y)p\\) is false at\n\\(t_1\\), since \\(c_2\\) is not included in \\(C(t_1)\\). According to the\ndefinition, \\(C(t_1)\\) should include exactly the chronicles which\npass through \\(t_1\\) and which immediately after \\(t_1\\) are specified\nby the TRL-function. This means that \\(C(t_1)=\\{c_1,c_3\\}\\), and then\n(T5) turns out to be false at \\(t_1\\).\n\nThis rejection of (T5) amounts to the following idea: a chronicle may\nnot be available as a possibility now, although it may later become\navailable. That is, new possibilities may show up.\n\nThis example illustrates that true futurist logics satisfying\nrequirements which correspond to Belnap\u2019s and Green\u2019s\nsemantical criteria may differ significantly from Prior\u2019s\nOckhamism. Even if we assume that (T1\u20134) should be valid and\nthat (TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032) should hold, we cannot be sure that (T5)\nis valid. On the other hand, some might of course intuitively find\n(T5) just as plausible as (T1\u20134), for which reason they would\ninsist on a definition of \\(C(t)\\) according to which (T5) is valid.\nThis, of course, means that the validity notion in (V) should be\nmodified introducing further restrictions on the acceptable\ndefinitions of \\(C(t)\\). In order to ensure the validity of (T5) one\nmight require that \\(C(t') \\subseteq C(t)\\) for all \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\)\nwith \\(t \\lt t'\\). Another possibility is of course to insist on the\nOckhamistic definition of \\(C(t)\\), i.e., \\(C(t) = \\{c \\mid t \\in c\\}\\),\nin which case TRL-validity would give the same result as\nOckham-validity.\n\nIt is still an open question which definition of TRL-validity we\nshould prefer, if we want it to include a semantical definition of\nwhat it means for a future contingent to be true, and if we want it to\nensure the validity of (T3) and (T3\u2032). In addition to the two\nsolutions mentioned above, we may consider a use of a TRL-function\nthat appears to bring us very close to Molina\u2019s notion of middle\nknowledge mentioned in section 1 (see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2014).\nThe idea is to let the evaluation of the truth-value of a proposition\ndepend on two moments, \\(s\\) and \\(t\\), instead of just one (see\nMacFarlane 2003; MacFarlane 2014; De Florio and Frigerio 2020). We may\nspeak of the truth-value of a proposition at the moment \\(t\\) from the\nperspective of moment \\(s\\). Whereas \\(t\\) is the moment of\nevaluation, \\(s\\) is the \u201ccontext of utterance\u201d or at\nleast a moment at which the statement in question is imagined to be\nconsidered.\n\nGiven the TRL-function, \\(\\TRL\\), and a moment \\(s\\), we introduce an\nadjusted thin red line function, \\(\\TRL_s\\), by defining that\n\\(\\TRL_s\\) and \\(TRL\\) differ only for moments that belong to the past\nof \\(s\\), in which case \\(\\TRL_s\\) gives the chronicle \\(TRL(s)\\). In\nother words, \\(\\TRL_s(t) = \\TRL(s)\\) for \\(t \\lt s\\), and otherwise\n\\(\\TRL_s(t) = \\TRL(t)\\). Intuitively, using \\(\\TRL_s\\) means that\n\\(s\\) is conceived as the perspective of the statement in question,\nand it is actual in the sense that at any moment before it would\nbelong to the true future according to the evaluation currently used.\nIt is easy to verify that \\(\\TRL_s\\), like \\(TRL\\), satisfy the\nconstraints (TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032). This means that \\(\\TRL_s\\)\nformally qualifies as a thin red line function for an arbitrary\nmoment, \\(s\\), in the same sense as \\(\\TRL\\).\n\nWe may illustrate the idea using discrete time. Assuming that every\nchronicle in TIME is isomorphic with the set of integers, there will\nfor each chronicle be a function, \\(back\\), from TIME to TIME such\nthat \\(back(t)\\) is the moment on the chronicle that is just before\nthe moment \\(t\\). Furthermore, there is a function \\(\\next_s\\) such\nthat \\(\\next_s(t)\\) is the moment following immediately after \\(t\\) on\n\\(\\TRL_s(t)\\).\n\nIt should be noted that it follows from (TRL1\u20132) that\n\\(\\TRL_s(t) = \\TRL_s(\\next_s(t)) = \\TRL_s(\\next_{s}^2(t)) = \\ldots\\)\nand in general that \\(\\next_{s}^n(t) \\in \\TRL_s(t)\\) for any natural\nnumber \\(n\\). In addition, it should be mentioned that since the\nbranching-time system is backwards linear, there is no need to specify\nthe chronicle in \\(back(t)\\).\n\nAssuming that there is a basic assignment function giving a\ntruth-value for each propositional letter at each instant, we may then\nintroduce the following recursive definition of the truth-value of a\ntense-logical proposition at the moment \\(t\\) seen from the\nperspective of the moment, \\(s\\):\n\n\n\\(T(t,s,p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(p\\) is a propositional letter assigned with the truth-value 1\nat the moment \\(t\\). \n\n\\(T(t,s,P(n)p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(T(\\back^n(t),s,p)=1\\) \n\n\\(T(t,s,F(n)p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(T(\\next_{s}^n(t),s,p)=1\\) \n\n\\(T(t,s,\\Diamond p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(\\exists t': t\\lt t' \\amp T(t,t',p)=1\\) \n\n\nNegation and the propositional connectives are treated in the\ntraditional manner. The necessity operator, \\(\\Box\\), is defined as\n\\(\\sim \\Diamond \\sim\\).\n\nA tense-logical proposition, \\(p\\), is said to be valid in general iff\nfor any branching-time system with a valuation function, \\(T\\),\ndefined in this manner it holds that \\(T(t,t,p)=1\\) at any instant\n\\(t\\) in the branching-time system.\n\nIf we identify t and s in this way, it is obvious that we obtain:\n\n(O1)\n\\(\\next_{t}^n(\\back^n(t))=t\\)\n(O2)\n\\(\\back^n(\\next_{t}^n (t))=t\\)\n\n\nIt follows from (O1\u20132) that \\(P(n)F(n)p \\equiv p\\) and\n\\(F(n)P(n)p \\equiv p\\) are valid theses in the semantics. Furthermore,\nit is easily verified that (T3\u2032), (T4), and (T5) are valid as\nwell in the system. It is also obvious that \\(P(n)F(n+m)p \\supset \\Box\nP(n)F(n+m)p\\) is not valid in general according to this semantics. In\nconsequence, the crucial principle (P3) should be rejected on this\nview. It seems that the semantics sketched here will have all the\nproperties, which one would expect in Ockhamistic (and Molinistic)\nsemantics (see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2014; \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and\nJakobsen 2018; De Florio and Frigerio 2019).\n",
