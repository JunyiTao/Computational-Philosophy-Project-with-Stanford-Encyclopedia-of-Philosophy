    "main_text": "Never Dying || Never Dying Would be a Misfortune\n7.2 Never Dying Would be a Misfortune\n\nBernard Williams (and others, such as Shelly Kagan 2012) takes the\nview that it would be bad to live forever, even under the best of\ncircumstances. In his influential essay \u201cThe Makropulos Case:\nReflections on the Tedium of Immortality,\u201d Williams argues that\nalthough the deaths of some persons is a misfortune for them, never\ndying would be intolerable. In arguing for these views, Williams draws\nupon the notion of a categorical desire, which we can clarify as\nfollows.\n\nConsider a woman who wants to die. She might still take the view that\nif she is to live on, then she should be well fed and clothed. She\nwants food and clothing on condition she remain alive. In this sense\nher desires (for food and clothes) are conditional on her remaining\nalive, and, in being conditional on her living on, they do not give\nher reason to live. Contrast a father who desires that his beloved\ndaughter have a good start in life. His desire is not conditional on\nhis remaining alive. In this sense, it is, Williams says, categorical.\nIn fact, his desire gives him reason to live, because he can see to\nher well-being if he survives. Williams thinks that our categorical\ndesires are not only what motivate us to live on, they give meaning to\nour lives, and are important elements of our characters. He also\nthinks that it is by virtue of the fact that we will retain the same\ncharacter until a later time that it is clear to us that we will be\nthe same person until then.\n\nThe bearing on death, according to Williams, is, first, that we have\ngood reason to condemn a death that is premature in the sense that it\nthwarts our categorical desires. Second, mortality is good, for if we\nlive long enough, eventually we will lose our categorical desires. At\nthat point we will no longer be motivated to live on, and oppressive\nboredom will set in. When we contemplate this fate from our vantage\npoint in the present, we find it that it is not even clear to us that\nthese bored seniors are us.\n\nIf we could find a way to extend our lives indefinitely, yet avoid the\nravages of senescence, and remain healthy and mentally competent,\ncouldn\u2019t we avoid becoming jaded with life by gradually varying\nour interests over time, adding to and perhaps replacing some of our\ncategorical desires, again and again? Several theorists including\nNagel (1986, p. 224, n. 3), Glover (1977, p. 57), and Fischer (1994),\nhave argued that the lives of superseniors need not become dull and\ntedious. Williams\u2019s view is that it is not possible to make\neternal life desirable (which claim is not identical to the claim that\neternal life would inevitably be bad for us). Varying my categorical\ndesires will not work, because, to be desirable, the endless life I\ndesign for myself must meet two conditions: (1) \u201cit should\nclearly be me who lives forever,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe state in\nwhich I survive should be one that, to me looking forward, will be\nadequately related, in the life it presents, to those aims I now have\nin wanting to survive at all.\u201d (1973, p. 83) If I replace my\ncategorical desires, I fall afoul of at least one of these conditions.\nLife under the future desires is detached from life under my current\ncategorical desires. Moreover, the desires I give myself in the future\nwill be elements of a character that is very different from my current\ncharacter; replacing my current character with an entirely different\none later in life makes it far less clear, Williams appears to think,\nthat the individual living that later life is me. \u201cThe degree of\nidentification needed with the later life \u2026 is absolutely\nminimal.\u201d (1973, p. 85)\n\nWilliams\u2019s claim that immortality cannot be made desirable\nremains controversial. It is not obvious that eternal life is\nundesirable if it involves changing our categorical desires and\ncharacters (insofar as our characters are defined by the desires). Nor\nis it obvious that such changes must violate Williams\u2019s two\nconditions for the desirability of continued life. Williams seems to\nthink that the individual who is changed in this way will not clearly\nbe the same person as before, but he stops short of saying that it\nclearly will not be the same person (indeed, he defends a bodily\ncontinuity criterion for identity in \u201cThe Self and the\nFuture,\u201d pp. 46\u201363, so he presumably thinks that a person\ndoes survive changes of desires and character). Concerning\nWilliams\u2019s second condition, his view is that if we replace our\ncharacters and desires, \u201cthere is nothing left by which he can\njudge\u201d whether future life is desirable (1093, p. 85). Yet it\nseems reasonable to take the view now that it would be good for me to\ndevelop and fulfil desires in the future\u2014desires I now lack.\nMany of us would welcome the prospect of gradually transforming our\ninterests and projects over time. The gradual, continuous\ntransformation of our desires and projects does not end our lives, or\nexistence. It is distinct from, and preferable to, annihilation. If we\ncould live endlessly, the stages of our lives would display reduced\nconnectedness, yet remain continuous, which is a property that is\nimportant in the kind of survival most of us prize. Even after\ndrinking from the fountain of eternal youth, we would tend to focus on\nrelatively short stretches of our indefinitely extensive lives, being\nanimated by the specific projects and relationships we have then.\nHowever, sometimes we would turn our attention to long stretches of\nlife, and then, prizing continuity, we might well phase in new and\nworthwhile undertakings that build upon, and do not wholly replace,\nthe old.
