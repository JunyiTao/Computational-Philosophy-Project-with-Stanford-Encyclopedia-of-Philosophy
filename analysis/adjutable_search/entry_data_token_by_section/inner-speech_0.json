    "main_text": "Inner Speech as Actual Speech\n1. Inner Speech as Actual Speech\n\nThe auditory-sensory character of inner speech is usually thought to\nbe due to its involvement of auditory-verbal imagery (for an\nexception, see O\u2019Brien 2013). Mental images (in any modality)\nare generally viewed as representations of particular things (or kinds\nof thing), not instances of those things. A visual image of a duck,\nfor example, is a representation of a duck, not an actual duck.\nLikewise, it may seem that inner speech, insofar as it involves\nauditory imagery, is a representation of speech (and of its sounds, in\nparticular), not actual speech. \u201cGrass is green\u201d, produced\nin inner speech, would then represent an utterance of the sentence,\n\u201cGrass is green\u201d, but it would not actually be an\nutterance of that sentence.\n\nNotwithstanding this, many philosophers working on inner speech hold\nthat inner speech really is a kind of speech. When we produce inner\nspeech, we are literally speaking, albeit silently. We will call this\nview the \u201cactual speech view\u201d. Proponents include\nCarruthers (1996), Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente (2010,\n2015), Gauker (2011, 2018), O\u2019Brien (2013), Jorba & Vicente\n(2014), Gerrans (2015), Gregory (2016, 2018) (though Gregory has\nindicated in more recent work (e.g., Gregory forthcoming) that he no\nlonger holds the view), Machery (2018), Wilkinson & Fernyhough\n(2018), Wilkinson (2020), and Frankfort (2022).\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente argued for the view in their\n2010 paper; their 2015 paper, discussed in\n Section 3.3.2,\n sets out an updated version of their theory which incorporates some\nfurther commitments. Historically, the view can be traced at least to\nthe Soviet psychologist, Lev Vygotsky (1934 [1986]), and it was also\nheld by Ryle (1949 [2009]). However, Gauker develops a somewhat\ndifferent version of the view\u2014one that sharply distinguishes\ninner speech from the auditory-verbal imagery typically associated\nwith it (see\n Section 3.2\n for discussion)\u2014which has its origins in Sellars (1956).\n\nIf inner speech is a kind of speech, instances of inner speech could\naptly be called \u201cinner speech utterances\u201d, as producing\ninner speech would really amount to saying something. However, in\norder to be neutral on the issue, we will use the term, \u201cinner\nspeech episodes\u201d, in this section and throughout the entry. An\nimportant issue for a proponent of the actual speech view is to\nexplain how inner speech can consist of genuine linguistic tokens,\ngiven that it seems to be an imagistic phenomenon\u2014where, as\nnoted, the images may appear to be representations of speech sounds.\nFor, even if inner speech consists of images of speech sounds, this\nonly suggests that it consists of representations of\nlinguistic items, not linguistic items themselves.\n\nOne style of answer has been offered by Sam Wilkinson (2020), who\ndraws a distinction between imagery and imagination. He holds that\nsensory imagining is a \u201cpersonal-level phenomenon\u201d, which\nhas components (2020: 16). One of the components of sensory imagining\n(as opposed to propositional or \u201cattitudinal\u201d imagining,\nwhich is typically assumed to be non-imagistic in nature) is mental\nimagery. For example, if one sensorily imagines a duck, then one\ncomponent of this personal-level mental state may be a mental image\nresembling the appearance of a duck. There might also be other\ncomponents, such as a stipulation that the image is an image of a duck\nand not another bird of similar appearance. But, Wilkinson emphasizes,\nmental imagery can be involved in many personal-level mental attitudes\napart from the attitude of imagining, such as remembering, judging,\nreasoning, and others. \u201cIn a similar way\u201d, he claims,\n\n\nimagery \u2026 may be involved in an inner assertion. That does not,\nhowever, make the inner assertion simply nothing more than the imagery\ninvolved in its production, still less an act of imagination. (2020:\n16).\n\n\nImagery can play many roles, Wilkinson is saying, and there is no\nreason that one of those roles should not be as a medium for\nlinguistic tokens. The inner assertion is \u201ca genuine\nassertion\u201d\u2014an instance of language consisting of\nimagery.\n\nIt might be replied that, although imagery can play a role in many\npersonal-level mental states apart from imagining, it plays a very\nsimilar role in all of them, viz., representing how a concrete object\n(whether actual or possible) appears or sounds. Mental imagery does\nnot tend to play a role similar to that of a linguistic token. So,\neven if mental imagery is involved in a range of personal-level mental\nstates, it is not obviously well-suited, in the case of inner speech,\nto play the specific role of actual linguistic tokens.\n\nThis challenge might be met by connecting the actual speech view with\nwork on the metaphysics of word tokens, as proposed by Wade Munroe\n(2022a, 2023). Munroe holds that\n\n\nwhat makes something, \u03c6, a token of a word type,\nw, is that the process of generating \u03c6 is\nexplained and guided by one\u2019s (tacit) knowledge of w\n(or the morphological structure of w), e.g., one\u2019s\nsemantic, syntactic, morphophonological/orthographic, knowledge of w\nstored in one\u2019s mental lexicon. (2022a: 4)\n\n\nThis allows him to hold that inner speech episodes can involve word\ntokens, insofar as their generation is guided by the relevant kind of\ntacit knowledge. (Though Munroe himself does not hold the actual\nspeech view; see\n Section 3.3.1\n for discussion of his view.) Relatedly, J. T. M. Miller (2021)\nexplicitly denies that word tokens are necessarily substances and\nholds, instead,\n\n\nthat particular or token words are objects, which are bundles of\nvarious sorts (most notably semantic, phonetic, orthographic, and\ngrammatical) properties. [sic] (2021: 5737)\n\n\nOne might hold that inner speech episodes in fact consist in such\nbundles.\n\nAlthough the matter of how inner speech episodes can involve genuine\nlinguistic tokens is of great importance for the actual speech view,\nit is only beginning to receive attention. However, several arguments\nhave been given in support of the theory generally. These include the\nfollowing:\n\nInner speech may be a developmental descendant of a kind of\nexternal speech. Piaget (1923 [1926/1959]) observed that young\nchildren have a practice of speaking to themselves aloud. He described\nthis kind of speech as \u201cegocentric speech\u201d (ibid, passim)\n(egocentric speech can be seen as one kind of private speech; see\nIntroduction). Vygotsky (1934 [1986]) presented empirical evidence\nthat inner speech develops in children as they internalize the\npractice of producing egocentric speech (though see Gregory\n(forthcoming) questioning this evidence). Vygotsky held that\negocentric speech becomes silent, inner speech, but that it does not\nchange in its fundamental nature, so it remains a kind of actual\nspeech (see also Wilkinson & Fernyhough (2018), Wilkinson\n(2020)).\nIntrospectively, it seems like we can perform speech\nacts\u2014e.g., make assertions and ask questions\u2014in inner\nspeech. But it would only be possible to perform speech acts in inner\nspeech if inner speech is a kind of speech (Wilkinson 2020; Wilkinson\n& Fernyhough 2018). (This issue is addressed further in\n Section 4.1.)\nOn the face of it, we produce inner speech for purposes such as\nfocusing our attention, motivating ourselves, and evaluating our\nactions. These correspond to purposes which instances of external\nspeech also often serve: focusing the attention of others, motivating\nthem, and commenting on their actions. There are also parallels in\nterms of how inner speech episodes and instances of external speech\nare constructed. Both often take the form of short, sub-sentential\nitems when this is sufficient (e.g., \u201cHere!\u201d, upon finding\nsomething which was lost) and more fully elaborated sentences when\nthis is necessary (e.g., when carefully listing the considerations\nrelevant to a difficult decision which needs to be made, whether by\noneself or by a group). Marta Jorba, Agust\u00edn Vicente, and\nFernando Mart\u00ednez-Manrique have taken these systematic\nparallels as evidence that inner speech and external speech are simply\ndifferent types of one phenomenon, namely, speech (Jorba & Vicente\n2014; Mart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente 2015).\nThere seems to be a contrast between imagining speaking and\nengaging in inner speech, as it is ordinarily understood. This\ncontrast, Gregory (2016) suggests, parallels the contrast between two\nkinds of external actions which we can perform. When an actor says the\nlines in their script, what they are producing is a representation of\nspeech that someone else might produce. The actor is, of course,\nspeaking, but they are doing so in the context of a pretense. What the\nactor is doing contrasts with the speech which they produce in, e.g.,\nan ordinary conversation with someone. The contrast between imagining\nspeaking and producing inner speech seems to map neatly onto the\ncontrast between what the actor does on the stage and what they do in\nan ordinary conversation. If this is so, then a natural analysis is\nthat the contrast between imagined speech and inner speech is a\ncontrast between a representation of speech and actual\nspeech\u2014which implies that inner speech is a kind of actual\nspeech.\n\n\nA couple of philosophers who hold the actual speech view but express\nit in different terms, or who hold very similar positions, should be\nmentioned. First, Philip Gerrans (2015) describes inner speech as\ninvolving \u201cimaginary action\u201d (2015: 296), but he is\nexplicit that, by this, he means only to say that producing inner\nspeech is an action performed covertly. He takes inner speech to\ninvolve speaking, but doing so silently.\n\nSecond, Johannes Roessler (2016) holds that there are different kinds\nof inner speech, one of which involves imagining speaking (rather than\nactually speaking), but in a particular way. He points out that we can\nimagine things, or imagine doing things, for different purposes. An\nact of imagining will then be successful to the extent that it\nachieves the purpose for which it is performed. So, one might, for\nexample, imagine making an assertion, but do so with the intention of\nimagining making an assertion which is true and relevant to context.\nThen the act of imagining making the assertion \u201cincurs the same\nliabilities\u201d (2016: 548) that the act of actually making the\nassertion would incur. If you are puzzling over some question, and you\nimagine asserting a possible answer, then the act of imagining will be\nsuccessful only if you have imagined asserting the correct answer.\nAlthough you have only imagined performing the speech act of making an\nassertion, your imagined assertion will be \u201cin some ways\ntantamount to an assertion\u201d (2016: 548).\n\nIt would be an open position, though not one Roessler takes, that all\ninner speech episodes could be analyzed in this way. On such a view,\ninner speech episodes would be something very similar to actual\nspeech, yet without quite being speech acts, and thus without the\ncommitment that producing inner speech involves producing actual\nlinguistic items.\n",
