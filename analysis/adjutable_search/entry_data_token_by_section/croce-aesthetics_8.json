    "main_text": "Externalization\n6. Externalization\n\nThe painting of pictures, the scrape of the bow upon strings, the\nchanting or inscription of a poem are, for Croce, only contingently\nrelated to the work of art, that is, to the expressed intuition. By\nthis Croce does not mean to say that for example the painter could get\nby without paint in point of fact; the impossibility of say the\nexistence of Leonardo\u2019s Last Supper without his having\nput paint on the wall of Santa Maria delle Grazie not an impossibility\nin principle, but it is a factual impossibility, like that of a man\njumping to the Moon. What he is doing is always driven by the\nintuition, and thereby making it possible for others to have the\nintuition (or rather, an intuition). First, the\nmemory\u2014though only contingently\u2014often requires the\nphysical work to sustain or develop the intuition. Second, the\nphysical work is necessary for the practical business of the\ncommunication of the intuition.\n\nFor example the process of painting is a closely interwoven operation\nof positive feedback between the intuitive faculty and the practical\nor technical capacity to manipulate the brush, mix paint and so\non:\n\nLikewise with the painter, who paints upon canvas or upon wood, but\ncould not paint at all, did not the intuited image, the line and\ncolour as they have taken shape in the fancy, precede, at\nevery stage of the work, from the first stroke of the brush or sketch\nof the outline to the finishing touches, the manual actions. And when\nit happens that some stroke of the brush runs ahead of the image, the\nartist, in his final revision, erases and corrects it.\n\n\nIt is, no doubt, very difficult to perceive the frontier between\nexpression and communication in actual fact, for the two processes\nusually alternate rapidly and are almost\nintermingled. But the distinction is ideally clear and must\nbe strongly maintained\u2026 The technical does not enter into art,\nbut pertains to the concept of communication. (PPH\n227\u20138, emphasis added; cf. Aes. 50\u20131, 96\u20137,\n103, 111\u201317; EA 41\u20137)\n\n\nHe also defines technique as \u2018knowledge at the service of the\npractical activity directed to producing stimuli to aesthetic\nreproduction\u2019 (Aes. 111). Again, we defer criticism to\nthe conclusion.\n",
