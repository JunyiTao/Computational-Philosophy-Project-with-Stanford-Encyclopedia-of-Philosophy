Answers to\nthat question vary (see Ghiselin 1969, Mayr 1982, Beatty 1992, Stamos\n2007, Mallet 2008, Kohn 2008, Wilkins 2009, and Ereshefsky 2010c).\nNevertheless, it seems that Darwin was an anti-realist when it comes\nto the species category, though a realist concerning those taxa called\n\u2018species\u2019 by competent naturalists. Consider what he wrote\nto his friend, the botanist Joseph Hooker.\n\nIt is really laughable to see what different ideas are prominent in\nvarious naturalists\u2019 minds, when they speak of\n\u2018species\u2019; in some, resemblance is everything and descent\nof little weight\u2014in some, resemblance seems to go for nothing,\nand Creation the reigning idea\u2014in some, sterility an unfailing\ntest, with others it is not worth a farthing. It all comes, I believe,\nfrom trying to define the indefinable. (December 24, 1856; in F.\nDarwin 1887, vol. 2, 88)\n\n\nFor Darwin, the word \u2018species\u2019 is indefinable. One reason\nhe thought it was indefinable because he was skeptical of the\ndistinction between species and varieties. For example, in the\nOrigin of Species, he writes, \u201cI look at the term\nspecies as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set\nof individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not\nessentially differ from the term variety\u201d (1859 [1964], 52). In\nother words, \u2018species\u2019 is indefinable because there is no\ndifference between species and varieties. But why would Darwin think\nthere is no distinction between species and varieties? Darwin offers\nseveral reasons (Ereshefsky 2010c). First, Darwin argues that no\nprocess distinguishes varieties from species. Second, he contends that\nany differences drawn between them lie on a seamless continuum and are\ndrawn for pragmatic reasons. Third, Darwin rejects the distinction\nbetween varieties and species because it is built on ideas concerning\ncreation rather than natural selection. In what follows we will just\nlook at why Darwin thought there was no process difference between\nspecies and varieties.\n\nChapter 8 of the Origin of Species titled\n\u201cHybridism\u201d is devoted to discussing whether hybrid\nsterility serves as an adequate criterion for distinguishing species\nfrom varieties. Such naturalists as John Ray and Buffon held that\nhybrid sterility marked the species/variety boundary. They believed\nthat offspring from parents of different species are sterile, whereas\noffspring from parents of different varieties of the same species are\nfertile. Much of Darwin\u2019s chapter on hybridism is dedicated to\nproviding counterexamples to the claim that hybrid sterility marks a\ndistinction between species and varieties. In the end, Darwin rejects\nhybrid sterility as a criterion for distinguishing species and\nvarieties. He writes, \u201cIt can thus be shown that neither\nsterility nor fertility affords a clear distinction between species\nand varieties\u201d (1859 [1964], 248).\n\nFurther evidence that Darwin doubted a process distinction between\nspecies and varieties is found in Chapter 4 of the Origin of\nSpecies, titled \u201cNatural Selection.\u201d Darwin proposes\ntwo principles, which he calls The Principle of Character Divergence\nand The Principle of Extinction. Together these principles explain the\norigin of new taxa and morphological gaps among taxa. The Principle of\nCharacter Divergence has a familiar Darwinian starting point. Suppose\nthat a geographic region contains several closely related groups of\norganisms. Within one of those groups, some organisms are selected\nbecause they have a trait that gives them an adaptive advantage.\nDivergent selection occurs in future generations when organisms with\neven better adapted forms of that trait are selected, eventually\ncausing pronounced morphological gaps between that group of organisms\nand its parent and sister groups (Darwin 1859 [1964], 112ff.). Darwin\nillustrates this process with a number of examples. Consider his\nexample of a pigeon fancier (1859 [1964],112). A pigeon fancier is\nstruck by the slightly longer beak of some birds. She then selects\nbirds with slightly longer beaks in that generation, and continues to\ndo so in subsequent generations until there is a pronounced\nmorphological gap between the selected group and the original stock.\nDarwin argues that the process of divergent selection causes the\norigin of new taxa and is the source of branching on the tree of\nlife.\n\nThe Principle of Extinction further explains the gaps we find in\nbiodiversity. As groups become more distinctive and better adapted to\ntheir environment, their parental and sister groups are pushed to\nextinction. This extinction of \u201cintermediates,\u201d as Darwin\ncalls them, causes the observed gaps among taxa (1859 [1964],121ff.).\nExtinction, in other words, prunes branches on tree of life so that it\nhas the shape we observe. Together, the Principles of Character\nDivergence and Extinction explain the origin of varieties and species,\nand the observed patterns of biodiversity in the world. The relevant\npoint for our discussion of Darwin is that there is no special\nspeciation mechanism that marks the difference between species and\nvarieties. As Kohn (2008) notes, Darwin did not use the word\n\u2018speciation\u2019 in the Origin. For Darwin, the\norigin of varieties and species is due to divergent selection. As\nDarwin writes: \u201cThe origin of the existence of groups\nsubordinate to groups, is the same with varieties as with species,\nnamely, closeness of descent with various degrees of\nmodification\u201d (1859 [1964], 423).\n\nThus far it has been suggested that Darwin doubted the existence of\nthe species category because he doubted the distinction between\nspecies and varieties. What about those taxa called\n\u2018species\u2019 by competent naturalists, are they real taxa for\nDarwin? It seems that Darwin was a realist when it comes to taxa. A\npassage at the start of the Origin\u2019s chapter on\nclassification, Chapter 13, confirms this. Darwin writes that\n\u201c[f]rom the first dawn of life, all organic beings are found to\nresemble each other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed\nin groups under groups. This classification is evidently not arbitrary\nlike the grouping of the stars in constellations\u201d (1859 [1964],\n411). Those taxa (\u201cgroups\u201d) identified by competent\nnaturalists can be real. And classifications of groups within groups,\nif properly constructed, reflect the hierarchical arrangement of taxa\nin the world. Thus, Darwin\u2019s skepticism of the species category\ndid not extend to taxa and those taxa called\n\u2018species.\u2019\n",
