    "main_text": "Expectation Theory || Assurance\n3.1 Assurance\n\nAssurance views require that the promisee seek and care for the\npromisor\u2019s assurance of performance. In other words, the\npromisee must want to be assured of the fact of the promisor\u2019s\npromissory fulfillment. The paradigm of this sort of view is\nScanlon\u2019s (1990, 1998)\n\nScanlon claims that promissory obligations derive from another sort of\nmore basic moral obligations, specifically obligations not to\n\u201cunfairly manipulate\u201d others. One has a moral duty to keep\none\u2019s promises because making a promise will lead others to\nbelieve that you will do what you promise. Breaking the promise is\nthen tantamount to deceiving those one promised, and since one has a\nmoral duty not to do this, one has a moral duty to keep one\u2019s\npromises.\n\nScanlon\u2019s principle governing a promise\u2019s generation of an\nobligation (the Principle of Fidelity, or Principle F) is:\n\n\nPrinciple F: If (1) A voluntarily and intentionally\nleads B to expect that A will do X (unless\nB consents to A\u2019s not doing so); (2)\nA knows that B wants to be assured of this; (3)\nA acts with the aim of providing this assurance, and has good\nreason to believe that he or she has done so; (4) B knows\nthat A has the intentions and beliefs just described; (5)\nA intends for B to know this, and knows that\nB does know it; (6) B knows that A has this\nknowledge and intent, then, in the absence of special justification,\nA must do X unless B consents to\nX\u2019s not being done. (Scanlon 1998: 304)\n\n\nPrinciple F is reasonable (i.e., a real moral principle with normative\nforce) because the reasons potential promisees have not to be deceived\noutweigh the reasons potential promisors have to deceive.\n\nOn Scanlon\u2019s view, it is enough that the promisee come to\nreasonably believe in the promisor\u2019s fulfillment for a breach to\nbe a wrong. The promisee need not suffer a loss, other than by\nepistemic disappointment, to be wronged.\n",
