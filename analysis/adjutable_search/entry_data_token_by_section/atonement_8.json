    "main_text": "How to Atone || Reparation/Restitution/Recompense/Satisfaction\n2.5 Reparation/Restitution/Recompense/Satisfaction\n\nAs noted in\n section 1.3.5,\n wrongdoers accrue a moral debt to their victim to, at the least,\nwithdraw the insult conveyed by, and repair the harmful effects of,\ntheir wrong. Sometimes the harm is so minor\u2014such as the harm\nresulting from forgetting to keep one\u2019s promise to one\u2019s\nspouse to pick up milk at the store\u2014that no reparation is\nrequired beyond repentance and an apology. But, often and tragically,\nwrong actions result in substantial harms. In those cases, it seems\nthat atonement and making amends require that wrongdoers fulfill their\nmoral debts to repair the harm.\n\nThe terms \u201creparation\u201d, \u201crestitution\u201d,\n\u201crecompense\u201d, and \u201csatisfaction\u201d all have\nslightly different shades of meaning (Spelman 2002). Satisfaction, as\ndefined above, is the most general term; \u201creparation\u201d in\neveryday speech is quite close in meaning. Recompense and restitution\nare more specific ways of repairing through monetary compensation or\nan exchange of equivalent value to the\n harm.[19]\n\nAlthough there are different shades of meaning to the four notions,\nthey are unified by sharing a goal that each aims to achieve: undoing\nthe harmful effects of the wrong (Zolkos\n 2020).[20]\n Harms cannot literally be completely undone, even in cases of minor\nwrongs and harms. I may replace your window I have carelessly broken\nwith a new window, but there still was a time when your window was\nbroken during which you were angry and resentful. Those latter events\ncannot be undone. Reparation, restitution, etc. aim at approximating\nan undoing of the harmful effects.\n",
