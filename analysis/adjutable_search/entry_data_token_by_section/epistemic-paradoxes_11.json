    "main_text": "Anti-expertise || Blindspots\n5.4 Blindspots\n\n\u2018I am a poet but I do not know it\u2019 expresses a proposition\nI cannot know.  But I can reach the proposition by other attitudes\nsuch as hoping and wishing. A blindspot for a propositional attitude\nis a consistent proposition that cannot be accessed by that\nattitude. Blindspots are relative to the means of reaching the\nproposition, the person making the attempt, and time at which he\ntries. Although \\(I\\) cannot rationally believe \u2018Polar bears\nhave black skin but I believe they do not\u2019 you can\nbelieve that I mistakenly believe polar bears do not have black\nskin. The evidence that persuades you I am currently making that\nmistake cannot persuade me that I am currently making that\nmistake. This is an asymmetry imposed by rationality rather than\nirrationality. Attributions of specific errors are personal blindspots\nfor the person who is alleged to have erred.\n\nThe anthropologist Gontran de Poncins begins his chapter on the arctic\nmissionary, Father Henry, with a prediction:\n\nI am going to say to you that a human being can live without complaint\nin an ice-house built for seals at a temperature of fifty-five degrees\nbelow zero, and you are going to doubt my word. Yet what I say is\ntrue, for this was how Father Henry lived; \u2026. (Poncins 1941\n[1988], 240])\n\n\nGontran de Poncins\u2019 subsequent testimony might lead the reader\nto believe someone can indeed be content to live in an ice-house. The\nsame testimony might lead another reader to believe that Poncins is\nnot telling the truth. But no reader ought to believe \u2018Someone\ncan be content to live in an ice house and everybody believes that is\nnot so\u2019. That is a universal blindspot.\n\nIf Gontran believes a proposition that is a blindspot to his reader,\nthen he cannot furnish good grounds for his reader to share his\nbelief. This holds even if they are ideal reasoners. So one\nimplication of personal blindspots is that there can be disagreement\namong ideal reasoners because they differ in their blindspots. \n\nThis is relevant to the surprise test paradox. The students are the\nsurprisees. Since the announcement entails that the date of the\nsurprise test a blindspot for them, non-surprisees cannot persuade\nthem.\n\nThe same point holds for intra-personal disagreement over time.\nEvidence that persuaded me on Sunday that \u2018This security code is\n390524 but on Friday I will not believe it\u2019 should no longer\npersuade me on Friday (given my belief that the day is Friday). For\nthat proposition is a blindspot to my Friday self.\n\nAlthough each blindspot is inaccessible, a disjunction of blindspots\nis normally not a blindspot. I can rationally believe that\n\u2018Either the number of stars is even and I do not believe it, or\nthe number of stars is odd and I do not believe it\u2019. The\nauthor\u2019s preface statement that there is some mistake in his\nbook is equivalent to a very long disjunction of blindspots. The\nauthor is saying he either falsely believes his first statement or\nfalsely believes his second statement or \u2026 or falsely believes\nhis last statement.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s announcement that there will be a surprise test is\nequivalent to a disjunction of future mistakes: \u2018Either there\nwill be a test on Monday and the student will not believe it\nbeforehand or there will be a test Wednesday and the student will not\nbelieve it beforehand or the test is on Friday and the student will\nnot believe it beforehand.\u2019\n\nThe points made so far suggest a solution to the surprise test paradox\n(Sorensen 1988, 328\u2013343). As Binkley (1968) asserts, the test\nwould be a surprise even if the teacher waited until the last day. Yet\nit can still be true that the teacher\u2019s announcement is\ninformative. At the beginning of the week, the students are justified\nin believing the teacher\u2019s announcement that there will be a\nsurprise test. This announcement is equivalent to:\n\n(A)\nEither\n \ni.\nthe test is on Monday and the student does not know it\nbefore Monday, or\nii.\nthe test is on Wednesday and the student does not know\nit before Wednesday, or\niii.\nthe test is on Friday and the student does not know it before\nFriday.\n\n\n\nConsider the student\u2019s predicament on Thursday (given that the\ntest has not been on Monday or Wednesday). If he knows that no test\nhas been given, he cannot also know that (A) is true. Because that\nwould imply\n\nThe test is on Friday and the student does not know it before\nFriday.\n\n\nAlthough (iii) is consistent and might be knowable by others, (iii)\ncannot be known by the student before Friday. (iii) is a blindspot for\nthe students but not for, say, the teacher\u2019s colleagues. Hence,\nthe teacher can give a surprise test on Friday because that would\nforce the students to lose their knowledge of the original\nannouncement (A). Knowledge can be lost without forgetting\nanything.\n\nThis solution makes who you are relevant to what you can know. In\naddition to compromising the impersonality of knowledge, there will be\ncompromise on its temporal neutrality.\n\nSince the surprise test paradox can also be formulated in terms of\nrational belief, there will be parallel adjustments for what we ought\nto believe. We are criticized for failures to believe the logical\nconsequences of what we believe and criticized for believing\npropositions that conflict with each other. Anyone who meets these\nideals of completeness and consistency will be unable to believe a\nrange of consistent propositions that are accessible to other complete\nand consistent thinkers. In particular, they will not be able to\nbelieve propositions attributing specific errors to them, and\npropositions that entail these off-limit propositions.\n\nSome people wear T-shirts with Question Authority! written on\nthem. Questioning authority is generally regarded as a matter of\nindividual discretion. The surprise test paradox shows that it is\nsometimes mandatory. The student is rationally required to doubt the\nteacher\u2019s announcement even though the teacher has not given any\nnew evidence of being unreliable. For when only one day remains, the\nannouncement entails (iii), a statement is that is impossible for the student to know.\nThe student can foresee that this forced loss of knowledge opens an\nopportunity for the teacher to give the surprise test. This\nforeknowledge is available at the time the announcement.\n\nThis solution implies there can be disagreement amongst ideal\nreasoners who agree on the same impersonal data. Consider the\ncolleagues of the teachers. They are not amongst those that the\nteacher targets for surprise. Since \u2018surprise\u2019 here means\n\u2018surprise to the students\u2019, the teacher\u2019s colleagues\ncan consistently infer that the test will be on the last day from the\npremise that it has not been given on any previous day. But these\ncolleagues are useless to the students as informants.\n",
