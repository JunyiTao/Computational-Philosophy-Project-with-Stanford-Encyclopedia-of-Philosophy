    "main_text": "Republic, Books II, III, X || Republic II\n3.1 Republic II\n\nIn order to respond to the famous challenge put to Socrates by Glaucon\nand Adeimantus, it is necessary to define justice. Socrates suggests\nthat the task would be easier if justice were first sought in a polis,\nwhere it is \u201cwrit large.\u201d That strategy accepted, the\npolis must be created in speech. It turns out that philosophic\nguardians are to rule the polis, and the next question concerns their\neducation (376e2). The critique of poetry in the Republic\ngrows out of a consideration of the proper education (from their\nchildhood on) of the philosopher-guardians in the \u201ccity in\nspeech.\u201d The context for the critique is therefore that of the\nspecific project of the Republic, and this raises a question\nas to whether the critique is meant to hold whether or not the\n\u201ccity in speech\u201d is possible or desirable.\n\nThe concern in book II is very much with the proper education of a\ncitizen, as befits the project of creating a model city. The\n\u201cmyth makers\u201d (377b11; Bloom translates \u201cmakers of\ntales\u201d) who supply the governing stories of the day are like\npainters (377e2) who make pictures of heroes and gods, and indeed of\nthe relations both among and between the two. From the outset,\nSocrates treats the poems (those by Hesiod and Homer are singled out,\nbut the critique isn\u2019t meant to be confined to them) as though they\ncontained not just falsehoods, but falsehoods held up as models of\ngood behavior. The poems are taken as educational and thus broadly\npolitical texts; persuasion (see 378c7) of a class of the young is\nvery much at stake. The young cannot judge well what is true and\nfalse; since a view of things taken on at early age is very hard to\neradicate or change, it is necessary to ensure that they hear only\nmyths that encourage true virtue (378d7\u2013e3). The pedagogic motivation\nin question certainly extends beyond the specific \u201ccity in\nspeech\u201d the Republic creates. Thus while the critique\nof poetry in book II and beyond is in this sense shaped by the\ncontextual concerns, it is not limited to them.\n\nFurther, Socrates takes aim at the content of several\nparticularly influential poems, and his arguments against that content\ndo not depend, here, on the project of creating the \u201cbest\ncity.\u201d One of his first targets is what he calls their\n\u201ctheology\u201d (379a5\u20136). Whether in epics, lyrics or\ntragedies, whether in meter or not (379a8\u20139, 380c1\u20132), god\nmust be described accurately, and that turns out to be as unchanging;\nas good and the cause of only good; as incapable of violence; and as\n\u201caltogether simple and true in deed and speech,\u201d for god\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t himself change or deceive others by illusions,\nspeeches, or the sending of signs either in waking or dreaming\u201d\n(382e8\u201311). For \u201cthere is no lying poet in a god\u201d\n(382d9). In short, the gods accurately conceived are remarkably\nsimilar to what Socrates will subsequently call, in Republic\nV-VII, the \u201cIdeas.\u201d Quite obviously, the dominant\n\u201ctheological\u201d foundation of the world-view prevalent in\nfourth and fifth century Greece\u2014and also any theological view\nthat does not meet the strictures Socrates specifies\u2014must be\nabandoned. The scope of the critique is breathtaking.\n\nAlong the way Socrates makes yet another point of great importance,\nnamely that the poets ought not be permitted to say that those\npunished for misdeeds are wretched; rather, they must say that in\npaying a (just) penalty, bad men are benefited by the god\n(380b2\u20136). Socrates is starting to push against the theses that\nbad people will flourish or that good people can be harmed. The cosmos\nis structured in such a way as to support virtue. Socrates is\nattempting to undermine what one might call a \u201ctragic\u201d\nworld view (note that in book X, he characterizes Homer as the\n\u201cleader\u201d of tragedy; 598d8).\n",
