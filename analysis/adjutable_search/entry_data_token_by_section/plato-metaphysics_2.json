    "main_text": "The Nature of Forms: Self-Predication\n3. The Nature of Forms: Self-Predication\n\n\nThe debate over self-predication involves both statements and what the\nstatements are about, i.e., the ontological correlates of those\nstatements. (Thus at times it may be important to distinguish\nlinguistic predication from ontological predication.) In investigating\nself-predication statements, perhaps it is again easiest to\ndistinguish three factors, the subject or subject term, \u2018The\nJust\u2019, the linking verb, \u2018is\u2019, and the predicate\nadjective \u2018just\u2019. Apparently both the subject and the\npredicate adjective, \u2018The Just\u2019 and \u2018just\u2019,\nrefer to the same thing, namely the Form of Justice. One question then\nconcerns the copula, or linking verb: in what manner is the predicate\nrelated to the subject, or how is the Form related to itself? There\nare three basic approaches to consider. In his seminal discussion of\nself-predication, Vlastos maintained that we should understand the\nrelation between the Form and itself to be the same as that between a\nparticular and the Form (Vlastos 1981d).  This is to say that Justice\nis just in the same way as Socrates is just, or that Beauty is\nbeautiful in the same way as Helen is beautiful, or that the Circle\nItself is circular in the same way as my basketball: both are\nround. Let us label this way of understanding the copula in\nself-predication statements \u2018characterization\u2019. Then\nBeauty is a beautiful thing, an item to be included in an inventory of\nbeautiful things right along with Helen.\n\n\nSome scholars, e.g., John Malcolm (1981), while accepting this\ncharacterizing reading of the \u2018is\u2019, deny that the property\npredicated of the Form and the particular are exactly the same.\nAccording to the Approximationist, the Form is the perfect\ninstance of the property it stands for. A particular that participates\nin the Form is an imperfect or deficient instance in that it has a\nproperty that approximates the perfect nature of the\nForm. For instance, the Circle Itself is perfectly circular. A drawn\ncircle, or a round ball, is deficient in that it is not perfectly\ncircular, not exactly 360 degrees in circumference. It follows that\nthe very properties particulars possess will differ from the\nproperty \u2018of the same name\u2019 possessed by the Form. If\nBeauty Itself is characterized by perfect beauty, then Helen has\nimperfect beauty and she does not have perfect beauty. Since nothing\nrules out that there are numerous kinds of imperfect beauty, perhaps\nas many as there are beautiful participants, it seems either that\nthere is no one kind of beauty that particulars have in common, or\nthat there are one or more (commonly shared) imperfect kinds of\nbeauty. In the former case, there will be no need to posit a\n\u2018one\u2019 over the many beauties. In the latter case, there is\nevery reason to posit a Form(s) of Imperfect Beauty in which the\ncommonly qualified imperfect particulars participate. Neither\nalternative is a happy one. While the appeal to the perfection of the\nmathematical properties is great, even in these cases it is doubtful\nthat Plato adopts an approximationist strategy (see Nehamas 1999b;\n1999c).\n\n\nAn alternative is to allow that while both Beauty Itself and other\nitems are characterized by beauty, Beauty Itself is simply and solely\nbeautiful. This characterizing variant emphasizes the Phaedo's\nclaims that a Form is monoeides and one (Phaedo\n78b4ff). Beauty is nothing but beautiful and thus is completely\nbeautiful, differing from other beautiful things in that they are much\nelse besides beautiful. Helen is a woman and unfaithful and\n beautiful.[4]\n\n\nAccording to the second\n approach (see Cherniss 1977a; Allen 1965),\n self-predication\nstatements assert identity between the Form and its essence. The\n\u2018is\u2019 is an \u2018is\u2019 of identity. We should not then\nunderstand \u2018Beauty Itself is beautiful\u2019 to assert that (the\nForm) Beauty is characterized by beauty. (Indeed, typically backers of\nthis approach exclude the possibility that a Form is characterized by\nthe property it is, thus, e.g., eliminating Beauty from a list of\nbeautiful objects.[5])\n Since Identity accounts treat\nself-predications as asserting that a Form and its essence are\nidentical, with respect to Forms, Being and Identity can be viewed as\nthe same relation in the middle period\n dialogues.[6]\n\n\nThe third approach, the Predicationalist (see Nehamas 1999c; Code\n1986; Silverman 2002), joins with the Identity approach in denying\nthat self-predication statements signal that the Form is characterized\nby the property it constitutes. And while ultimately it allows that a\nForm and its essence are identical, it does not regard the\nself-predication statement itself as an identity claim (see Code 1986;\nSilverman 2002 Ch. 3).  Rather, a self-predication claim asserts that\nthere is a special primitive kind of ontological relation between a\nForm (subject) and its essence (predicate). This approach begins from\nthe two relations of Partaking and Being introduced in the last\nargument of the Phaedo. An intuitive first approximation of\ntheir respective functions is to treat Partaking as a relation between\nmaterial particulars and Forms, the result of which is that the\nparticular is characterized by the Form of which it partakes. So,\nHelen, by partaking of Beauty, is characterized by beauty; Helen, in\nvirtue of partaking, is (or, as we might say, becomes) beautiful. All\nparticulars are characterized by the Forms in which each participates,\nand whatever each is, it is by partaking in the appropriate\nForm. On this account, then, there can be Forms for each and every\nproperty had by particulars (Phaedo 100\u2013101, esp. 100c6). In\ncontrast to the characterizing relation of Partaking, the relation of\nBeing is always non-characterizing. Each Form, F, is its\nessence (ousia), which is to say that the relation of Being\nlinks the essence of beauty to the subject, Beauty\n Itself.[7]\n Being,\nthen, is a primitive ontological relation designed exclusively to\ncapture the special tie between that which possesses an essence and the\nessence possessed. Put differently, whenever essence is predicated of\nsomething, the relation of Being is at work. (By\n\u2018primitive\u2019 I do not mean to suggest that Plato does not\nstudy (what) Being (is). Nor do I mean to suggest that everything else\nin the metaphysics can somehow be deduced from it. Rather, I mean to\nindicate that the relation of Being is not explained by appeal to\nanother more basic relation or principle. Its nature, and the nature of\nother primitives in the theory, such as Participating, is displayed in\nthe ways in which the theory attempts to save various phenomena.)\n",
