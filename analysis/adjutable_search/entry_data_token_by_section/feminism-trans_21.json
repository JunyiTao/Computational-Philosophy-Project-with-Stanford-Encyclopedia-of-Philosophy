Both accounts agree that, in a\nway, there is no change of sex/gender at all. One remains the\nsex/gender one always was. She calls both of these \u201cmasquerade\nhypotheses\u201d (12). In the first version, adopted usually by (some)\nnontrans people, the trans person who transitions from one sex/gender\nto another is merely donning a mask or engaging in a pretense that\neffectively hides what they always really were (the \u201ctrue\nperson\u201d). In such a view, the trans person is represented as\neither deceptive or deluded. In the second version, adopted usually by\n(some) trans people, the trans person who transitions is merely\nbecoming what they always already were, through pulling off a kind of\nbodily mask which fails to express what they are \u201con the\ninside\u201d (the \u201ctrue person\u201d). In both accounts,\nsex/gender is invariant. Rather than changing sex/gender, one either\nmoves into the state of masquerade or out of it. Overall argues that\nboth the delusion and deception are implausibly applied to the diverse\nlives of all trans people and, indeed, belied by the lives of many\ntrans people (13-14). She rejects the second masquerade account on the\ngrounds that it relies on a suspect metaphysics (14-18).\n\n\nIn Overall's view, by contrast, we ought to understand sex/gender\ntransition as analogous to \u201cother life-changing and\nlife-enhancing aspirations for personal transformation and\nself-realization\u201d (19). Some of the examples she gives include\nbecoming an immigrant; joining a twelve-step program to give up\nalcohol, joining a religion, becoming a mother. \u201cSome goals and\naspirations,\u201d Overall writes, \u201care deeply felt and of\ncentral value to particular individuals, and it is those goals and\naspirations that provide the dominant drives of the individual\u201d\n(19).  In place of both masquerade views, she proposes that we view\nsex/gender transition as an actual change in sex/gender. What remains\nconstant is not some reified gendered self. Instead, the person\n\u201cpersists insofar as her way of being, after transition, is\ndesired and actively sought by her previous self, so that the way of\nbeing after the transition grows out of the previous self, is\ngenerated by the previous self, and can be understood in terms of\ncharacteristics of the previous self\u201d (20).\n\n\nOne unfortunate consequence of this view is that a trans man (for\nexample) cannot truthfully claim to be a man prior to\ntransitioning. To be sure, there is a sense in which being a man is a\ncore part of his identity both prior to transition and afterwards,\nsince becoming a man is a life-changing aspiration subsequently\nrealized. Her account is therefore importantly different from the\nfirst masquerade account in that it takes seriously trans identities,\nviewing them as striving for a kind of authenticity. But his claim to\nbe a man (or male) prior to transitioning is still false. To see this\nmore clearly consider that insofar as Overall (2009) effectively\ndefines sex in terms of genitalia (11), it follows that a trans man\nwho has not undergone phalloplasty has not yet changed his sex (and is\nstill therefore female, and possibly still a woman). The problem is\nthat, in part owing to its cost, many trans men elect not to have this\ntype of surgery. Nonetheless, they may still regard themselves as men\n(and even male). This leaves open the possibility for the charge of\nself-delusion or self-deception to re-emerge despite Overall's attempt\nto avoid this.\n\n\nOverall (2012) uses her conception of gender/sex\ntransition as aspirational, to undermine the view that trans and\ncisgender people are very different from each other. Her goal in doing\nthis is not to elide the forms of violence and discrimination to which\ntrans people are subject as trans, but to call into question the view\nthat being cisgender is normal, while being trans is deviant\n(252-3).\n\n\nShe distinguishes between acquired and aspirational identities. The\nfirst are assigned or earned in such a way that no further work is\nrequired to maintain them (255). For example, being a biological\nmother is an acquired identity. Aspirational identity, by contrast,\nrequires constant work to maintain (256). For example, being a mother\n(as in a caregiver for one or more children) requires constant\nmaintenance. Overall argues that gender identity (by which she means\nthe social categories boy/man and girl/woman) is aspirational in\nnature. \u201cOne can aspire to exemplify a gender through the\naforementioned bodily styling, self-presentation, and gendered\nactivities, all of which must be ongoing for gender identity\nmaintenance\u201d (256-57). She also argues that sex itself may be\nbecoming an aspirational identity (at least for some) insofar as both\ncis and trans people alike seek out surgery and other medical\nprocedures (e.g. hormone therapy) to alter or augment the sexual\ncharacteristics of their bodies (258).\n\n\nOverall then argues that trans and cis people have the following\nfeatures in common (with regard to aspirational identity). Both are\nimmersed in a system of compulsory gender maintenance, both are\nsubject to constraints on how their gender identities are maintained\nwhile also afforded various opportunities to express their identities,\nboth are subject to various dangers connected to gender maintenance\n(e.g., trans people can be subject to transphobic violence for\n\u201cmisrepresenting\u201d their genital status, while cis women may\nbe subject to violence on the basis of their gender presentation),\nfinally (and contrary to a common assumption) both may experience\nforms of continuity and discontinuity in their gender aspirations. For\nexample, a trans person may harbor gender aspirations of being a\ngirl/woman for most of their life, while a cis woman may, as a\nconsequence of feminism, alter her womanly aspirations. In this way,\nOverall continues this non-trans feminist project of finding grounds\nfor solidarity between non-trans feminists and trans people.\n",
