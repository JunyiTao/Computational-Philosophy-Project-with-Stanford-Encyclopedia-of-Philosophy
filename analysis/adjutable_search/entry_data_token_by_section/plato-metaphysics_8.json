A reader who has some familiarity with philosophy since\nDescartes may well think that epistemology must address the question\nwhether there is any knowledge. Plato never considers the global\nskeptical challenge. He assumes that there is knowledge, or at least\nthat it is possible, and he inquires into the conditions that make it\npossible. These conditions, broadly conceived, concern, on the one\nhand, the rational capacities of humans, or more accurately souls,\nand, on the other hand, the objects of knowledge. With respect to\nobjects, Forms certainly are objects of knowledge. However, there is\nmuch dispute as to whether anything in the material world is a\nsuitable object. The physical world is an image, an imperfect world of\nchange.  Many passages in the Phaedo and, most dramatically,\nthe Republic's great metaphors of Sun, Line and Cave, imply\nthat Plato is a skeptic about knowledge of the physical, sensible\nworld.  Humans can have only beliefs about it. But many recoil at the\nprospect that Plato is such a skeptic. Citing the thrust of other\ndiscussions, these readers argue that while all knowledge for Plato\nmust be based, in some sense, on Forms, one who knows Forms can also\nacquire knowledge of the physical world (see Fine 1978; 1990).\n\n\nConcerns about the inherent intelligibility, or lack thereof, of the\nphysical world, prompt Plato to propose the doctrine of recollection,\ni.e., the thesis that our disembodied, immortal souls have seen the\nForms prior to their incarceration in the body. If Forms are the\n(basic) objects of knowledge, and Forms are not in the physical world,\nthen we must have acquired that knowledge at some point prior to our\ncommerce with that world. But metaphysical issues about the\nsimplicity of Forms also affect how we are to conceive of\nknowledge in these middle period works. If Forms are simple, then it\nseems that knowledge is intuitive or acquaintance-like: in a\nnon-propositional manner one somehow sees a Form, itself by itself. The\ncentral books of the Republic suggest such a picture. On the\nother hand, the many passages in which Plato declares that in order to\nknow a Form one must be able to give its definition suggest both that\nForms are related to one another, e.g., the Form of Human is related to\nthe Forms of Rationality, Bipedality, Animality, the \u2018elements of\nits definition, and that knowledge is propositional or akin to\nknowledge by description (cf. Gorgias 465a, 501a2\u20133,\nRepublic 534b). These passages seem to imply that perhaps\nknowledge is some form of justified true belief. A critical question\nthen is how one obtains the appropriate kind of justification to tie\ndown or convert a belief into knowledge. Plato offers little in the way\nof detail on this score, but twice he alludes to a method of\nhypothesis, suggesting both in the Phaedo and\nRepublic that hypotheses and their ultimately being rendered\n\u2018non-hypothetical\u2019 is part of the process by which one\ncomes to know a Form. Thus we have four broad notions to explore in\nPlato's middle period epistemology: knowledge, belief, recollection and\nthe method of hypothesis.\n",
