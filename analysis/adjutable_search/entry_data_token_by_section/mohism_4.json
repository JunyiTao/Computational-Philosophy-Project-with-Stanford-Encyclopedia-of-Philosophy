    "main_text": "Logic and Argumentation\n5. Logic and Argumentation\n\n\nBesides its role in their epistemology, the theory of the\n three fa (models)\n epitomizes the Mohists\u2019\nview of logic and argumentation. The Mohists do not investigate formal\nlogic or develop a notion of logical consequence. Rather, since they\nsee judgment as a matter of distinguishing whether something is one\nkind of thing or another, they tend to conceive of all reasoning on the\nmodel of informal, analogical inference. Particular pieces of reasoning\nin Mohist texts may be deductive, inductive, analogical, or causal. But\nthe Mohists themselves seem to regard all of these as different ways of\napplying fa to draw distinctions between similar and\ndissimilar kinds of things.\n\n\nTheir basic model of reasoning can be thought of as comprising three\nparts. (1) One or more fa (standards, models,\nor examples) are cited by which to distinguish \u201cthis\u201d\nfrom \u201cnot\u201d or to guide the use of some term, such as\nren (benevolent) or yi (morally righteous). (2) Then\nit is indicated how some object, event, or practice does or does not\n\u201cconform\u201d to or \u201ccoincide\u201d with the\nfa. (3) Accordingly, the thing in question is distinguished\nas \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cnot,\u201d as benevolent and\nrighteous or unbenevolent and unrighteous. So what we think of as the\nmajor premise in a syllogistic piece of reasoning, the Mohists\nprobably see as citing a fa. What we call a minor premise,\nthey see as a claim that something \u201cconforms\u201d to the\nfa. What we think of as drawing a conclusion, they see as\ndistinguishing whether or not something is the same kind of thing as\nthe fa. Later Mohist texts make it clear that this reasoning\nprocess is regarded as a form of analogical inference or projection,\nwhich they call \u201cextending kinds\u201d (tui lei)\n\u2014 that is, \u201cextending\u201d our judgment of what counts\nas \u201cof the same kind\u201d to include new cases. In practice,\n\u201cextending kinds\u201d amounts to taking the judgment that\nthings are \u201cof a kind\u201d (lei) in one or more\nrespects as a basis for treating them as \u201cof a kind\u201d in\nanother.\n\n\nThe three fa method of argument is one application of this\ngeneral type of argument by example or analogy. But the three\nfa are not the only standards or models the Mohists employ.\nThey regularly cite others, such as the behavior of the paradigmatic\nbenevolent person (ren ren) or filial son (xiao zi). Many\nMohist arguments proceed by establishing such a model or example and\nthen contending that Mohist doctrine conforms to it, and is thus\ncorrect. For instance, two of the main arguments for the doctrine of\ninclusive care begin by citing the model of the benevolent person, who \u201cseeks\nto promote the world\u2019s benefit and eliminate the world\u2019s harm\u201d (books\n15 and 16). The text goes on to argue that the doctrine of inclusive\ncare promotes benefit to all and so conforms to the standard set by the\nbenevolent person. Thus inclusive care is benevolent and righteous.\n\n\nA second example is the chief argument against extravagant funerals\n(Book 25). It too begins by citing the benevolent person as an ethical\nparadigm, but here the opening move is to establish, by analogy, the\nattitude of the filial son toward his parents as a model for that of\nthe benevolent person toward society: \u201cThe benevolent person\u2019s planning on behalf of\nthe world, to give an analogy, is in no respect different from the\nfilial son\u2019s planning on behalf of his parents.\u201d The filial son seeks\nto provide his parents with wealth, a large family, and social order.\nSo too has the benevolent person \u201cthree duties\u201d on behalf of society: to\nsecure wealth, a large population, and social order. Having established\nthese \u201cthree benefits\u201d as criteria for what is benevolent and righteous, the\ntext goes on to argue that the practice of lavish funerals and lengthy\nmourning yields poverty, a small population, and social turmoil, and\nthus is \u201cunbenevolent, unrighteous, and not the deed of a filial son.\u201d\n\n\nBoth the inclusive care argument and the funerals argument illustrate\nanother common Mohist rhetorical strategy: tracing the causal\nconsequences of a doctrine or policy, typically to show that Mohist\ndoctrine yields results that tally with some standard while an\nopposing doctrine does not. One text (Book 16) dubs this argument\ntechnique \u201cdeveloping two alternatives\u201d (liang er jin\nzhi).  The text identifies two contrasting moral guidelines,\n\u201cinclusive\u201d versus \u201cexclusive\u201d moral concern,\nand explores their causal consequences to see which yields results\nthat conform to the ethical standard of \u201cpromoting the world\u2019s\nbenefit and eliminating the world\u2019s harm.\u201d That alternative\n\u2014 \u201cinclusive\u201d concern, as the Mohists see it \u2014\nis therefore \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cright\u201d (shi),\nthe other \u201cnot\u201d (fei).\n",
