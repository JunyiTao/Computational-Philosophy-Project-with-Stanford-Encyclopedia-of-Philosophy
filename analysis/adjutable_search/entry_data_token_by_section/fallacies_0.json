    "main_text": "The core fallacies\n1. The core fallacies\n\nIrving Copi\u2019s 1961 Introduction to Logic gives a brief\nexplanation of eighteen informal fallacies. Although there is some\nvariation in competing textbooks, Copi\u2019s selection captured what\nfor many was the traditional central, core\n fallacies.[1]\n In the main, these fallacies spring from two fountainheads:\nAristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations and John\nLocke\u2019s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690).\nBy way of introduction, a brief review of the core fallacies,\nespecially as they appear in introductory level textbooks, will be\ngiven. Only very general definitions and illustrations of the\nfallacies can be given. This proviso is necessary first, because, the\ndefinitions (or identity conditions) of each of the fallacies is often\na matter of contention and so no complete or final definition can be\ngiven in an introductory survey; secondly, some researchers wish that\nonly plausible and realistic instances of each fallacy be used for\nillustration. This also is not possible at this stage. The advantage\nof the stock examples of fallacies is that they are designed to\nhighlight what the mistake associated with each kind of fallacy is\nsupposed to be. Additional details about some of the fallacies are\nfound in Sections 2 and 3. As an initial working definition of the\nsubject matter, we may take a fallacy to be an argument that seems to\nbe better than it really is.\n\n1. The fallacy of  equivocation is an argument which exploits\nthe ambiguity of a term or phrase which has occurred at least twice in\nan argument, such that on the first occurrence it has one meaning and\non the second another meaning. A familiar example is:\n\nThe end of life is death.\n\nHappiness is the end of life.\n\nSo, death is happiness.\n\n\u2018The end of life\u2019 first means ceasing to live, then it\nmeans purpose. That the same set of words is used twice conceals the\nfact that the two distinct meanings undermine the continuity of the\nreasoning, resulting in a non-sequitur.\n\n2. The fallacy of amphiboly is, like the fallacy of\nequivocation, a fallacy of ambiguity; but here the ambiguity is due to\nindeterminate syntactic structure. In the argument:\n\nThe police were told to stop drinking on campus after midnight.\n\nSo, now they are able to respond to emergencies much better than\nbefore\n\nthere are several interpretations that can be given to the premise\nbecause it is grammatically ambiguous. On one reading it can be taken\nto mean that it is the police who have been drinking and are now to\nstop it; this makes for a plausible argument. On another reading what\nis meant is that the police were told to stop others (e.g., students)\nfrom drinking after midnight. If that is the sense in which the\npremise is intended, then the argument can be said to be a fallacy\nbecause despite initial appearances, it affords no support for the\nconclusion.\n\n3 & 4. The fallacies of composition and division\noccur when the properties of parts and composites are mistakenly\nthought to be transferable from one to the other. Consider the two\nsentences:\n\nEvery member of the investigative team was an excellent\nresearcher.\nIt was an excellent investigative team.\n\n\nHere it is \u2018excellence\u2019 that is the property in question.\nThe fallacy of composition is the inference from (a) to (b) but it\nneed not hold if members of the team cannot work cooperatively with\neach other. The reverse inference from (b) to (a)\u2014the fallacy of\ndivision\u2014may also fail if some essential members of the team\nhave a supportive or administrative role rather than a research\nrole.\n\n5. The fallacy of begging the question (petitio principii)\ncan occur in a number of ways.  One of them is nicely illustrated with\nWhately\u2019s (1875 III \u00a713) example: \u201cto allow everyman\nan unbounded freedom of speech must always be, on the whole,\nadvantageous to the State; for it is highly conducive to the interest\nof the Community, that each individual should enjoy a liberty\nperfectly unlimited, of expressing his sentiments.\u201d This argument begs\nthe question because the premise and conclusion are the very same\nproposition, albeit expressed in different words. It is a disguised\ninstance of repetition which gives no reason for its apparent\nconclusion.\n\nAnother version of begging the question can occur in contexts of\nargumentation where there are unsettled questions about key terms.\nSuppose, for example, that everyone agrees that to murder someone\nrequires doing something that is wrong, but not everyone agrees that\ncapital punishment is a form of \u2018murder\u2019; some think it is\njustified killing.  Then, should an arguer gives this argument:\n\n  Capital punishment requires an act of murdering human beings.\n  So, capital punishment is wrong.\n\none could say that this is question-begging because in this context of\nargumentation, the arguer is smuggling in as settled a question that\nremains open.  That is, if the premise is accepted without further\njustification, the arguer is assuming the answer to a controversial\nquestion without argument.\n\nNeither of these versions of begging the question are faulted for\ntheir invalidity, so they are not charged with being non-sequitors\nlike most of the core fallacies; they are, however, attempted proofs\nthat do not transparently display their weakness. This consideration,\nplus its ancient lineage back to Aristotle, might explain begging the\nquestion\u2019s persistent inclusion among fallacies.  But, given our\nallegiance to the modern conception of logic as being solely concerned\nwith the following-from relation, forms of begging the question should\nbe thought of as epistemic rather than logical fallacies.\n\nSome versions of begging the question are more involved and are called\ncircular reasoning. They include more than one inference. Descartes\nillustrated this kind of fallacy with the example of our belief in the\nBible being justified because it is the word of God, and our belief in\nGod\u2019s existence being justified because it is written in the \nBible.[2]\n The two propositions lead back and forth to each other, in a circle,\neach having only the support of the other.\n\n6. The fallacy known as complex question or many\nquestions is usually explained as a fallacy associated with\nquestioning. For example, in a context where a Yes or No answer must\nbe given, the question, \u201cAre you still a member of the Ku Klux\nKlan?\u201d is a fallacy because either response implies that one has\nin the past been a member of the Klan, a proposition that may not have\nbeen established as true. Some say that this kind of mistake is not\nreally a fallacy because to ask a question is not to make an\nargument.\n\n7. There are a number of fallacies associated with causation, the most\nfrequently discussed is post hoc ergo propter hoc, (after\nthis, therefore because of this). This fallacy ascribes a causal\nrelationship between two states or events on the basis of temporal\nsuccession. For example,\n\nUnemployment decreased in the fourth quarter because the government\neliminated the gasoline tax in the second quarter.\n\nThe decrease in unemployment that took place after the elimination of\nthe tax may have been due to other causes; perhaps new industrial\nmachinery or increased international demand for products. Other\nfallacies involve confusing the cause and the effect, and overlooking\nthe possibility that two events are not directly related to each other\nbut are both the effect of a third factor, a common cause. These\nfallacies are perhaps better understood as faults of explanation than\nfaults of arguments.\n\n8. The fallacy of ignoratio elenchi, or irrelevant\nconclusion, is indicative of misdirection in argumentation rather than\na weak inference. The claim that Calgary is the fastest growing city\nin Canada, for example, is not defeated by a sound argument showing\nthat it is not the biggest city in Canada. A variation of\nignoratio elenchi, known under the name of the straw man\nfallacy, occurs when an opponent\u2019s point of view is distorted in\norder to make it easier to refute. For example, in opposition to a\nproponent\u2019s view that (a) industrialization is the cause of\nglobal warming, an opponent might substitute the proposition that (b)\nall ills that beset mankind are due to industrialization and then,\nhaving easily shown that (b) is false, leave the impression that (a),\ntoo, is false. Two things went wrong: the proponent does not hold (b),\nand even if she did, the falsity of (b) does not imply the falsity of\n(a).\n\nThere are a number of common fallacies that begin with the Latin\nprefix \u2018ad\u2019 (\u2018to\u2019 or\n\u2018toward\u2019) and the most common of these will be described\nnext.\n\n9. The ad verecundiam fallacy concerns appeals to authority\nor expertise. Fundamentally, the fallacy involves accepting as\nevidence for a proposition the pronouncement of someone who is taken\nto be an authority but is not really an authority. This can happen\nwhen non-experts parade as experts in fields in which they have no\nspecial competence\u2014when, for example, celebrities endorse\ncommercial products or social movements. Similarly, when there is\ncontroversy, and authorities are divided, it is an error to base\none\u2019s view on the authority of just some of them. (See also 2.4\nbelow.)\n\n10. The fallacy ad populum is similar to the ad\nverecundiam, the difference being that the source appealed to is\npopular opinion, or common knowledge, rather than a specified\nauthority. So, for example:\n\nThese days everyone (except you) has a car and knows how to drive;\n\nSo, you too should have a car and know how to drive.\n\nOften in arguments like this the premises aren\u2019t true, but even\nif they are generally true they may provide only scant support for\ntheir conclusions because that something is widely practised or\nbelieved is not compelling evidence that it is true or that it should\nbe done. There are few subjects on which the general public can be\nsaid to hold authoritative opinions. Another version of the ad\npopulum fallacy is known as \u201cplaying to the gallery\u201d\nin which a speaker seeks acceptance for his view by arousing relevant\nprejudices and emotions in his audience in lieu of presenting it with\ngood evidence.\n\n11. The ad baculum fallacy is one of the most controversial\nbecause it is hard to see that it is a fallacy or even that it\ninvolves bad reasoning. Ad baculum means \u201cappeal to the\nstick\u201d and is generally taken to involve a threat of injury of\nharm to the person addressed. So, for example,\n\nIf you don\u2019t join our demonstration against the expansion of the\npark, we will evict you from your apartment;\n\nSo, you should join our demonstration against the expansion of the\npark.\n\nSuch threats do give us reasons to act and, unpleasant as the\ninterlocutor may be, there seems to be no fallacy here. In labour\ndisputes, and perhaps in international relations, using threats such\nas going on strike, or cutting off trade routes, are not normally\nconsidered fallacies, even though they do involve intimidation and the\nthreat of harm. However, if we change to doxastic considerations, then\nthe argument that you should believe that candidate \\(X\\) is\nthe one best suited for public office because if you do not believe\nthis you will be evicted from your apartment, certainly is a good\ninstance of irrelevant evidence.\n\n12. The fallacy ad misericordiam is a companion to the ad\nbaculum fallacy: it occurs not when threats are out of place but\nwhen appeals for sympathy or pity are mistakenly thought to be\nevidence. To what extent our sympathy for others should influence our\nactions depends on many factors, including circumstances and our\nethical views. However, sympathy alone is generally not evidence for\nbelieving any proposition. Hence,\n\nYou should believe that he is not guilty of embezzling those\npaintings; think of how much his family suffered during the\nDepression.\n\nAd misericordiam arguments, like ad baculum\narguments, have their natural home in practical reasoning; it is when\nthey are used in theoretical (doxastic) argumentation that the\npossibility of fallacy is more likely.\n\n13. The ad hominem fallacy involves bringing negative aspects\nof an arguer, or their situation, to bear on the view they are\nadvancing. There are three commonly recognized versions of the\nfallacy. The abusive ad hominem fallacy involves saying that\nsomeone\u2019s view should not be accepted because they have some\nunfavorable property.\n\nThompson\u2019s proposal for the wetlands may safely be rejected\nbecause last year she was arrested for hunting without a license.\n\nThe hunter Thompson, although she broke the law, may nevertheless have\na very good plan for the wetlands.\n\nAnother, more subtle version of the fallacy is the circumstantial\nad hominem in which, given the circumstances in which the\narguer finds him or herself, it is alleged that their position is\nsupported by self-interest rather than by good evidence. Hence, the\nscientific studies produced by industrialists to show that the levels\nof pollution at their factories are within the law may be undeservedly\nrejected because they are thought to be self-serving. Yet it is\npossible that the studies are sound: just because what someone says is\nin their self-interest, does not mean it should be rejected.\n\nThe third version of the ad hominem fallacy is the tu\nquoque. It involves not accepting a view or a recommendation\nbecause the espouser him- or herself does not follow it. Thus, if our\nneighbor advises us to exercise regularly and we reject her advice on\nthe basis that she does not exercise regularly, we commit the tu\nquoque fallacy: the value of advice is not wholly dependent on\nthe integrity of the advisor.\n\nWe may finish our survey of the core fallacies by considering just two\nmore.\n\n14. The fallacy of faulty analogy occurs when analogies are\nused as arguments or explanations and the similarities between the two\nthings compared are too remote to support the conclusion.\n\nIf a child gets a new toy he or she will want to play with it;\n\nSo, if a nation gets new weapons, it will want to use them.\n\nIn this example (due to Churchill 1986, 349) there is a great\ndifference between using (playing with) toys and using (discharging)\nweapons. The former is done for amusement, the latter is done to\ninflict harm on others. Playing with toys is a benign activity that\nrequires little justification; using weapons against others nations is\nsomething that is usually only done after extensive deliberation and\nas a last resort. Hence, there is too much of a difference between\nusing toys and using weapons to conclude that a nation, if it acquires\nweapons, will want to use them as readily as children will want to\nplay with their toys.\n\n15. The fallacy of the slippery slope generally takes the\nform that from a given starting point one can by a series of\nincremental inferences arrive at an undesirable conclusion, and\nbecause of this unwanted result, the initial starting point should be\nrejected. The kinds of inferences involved in the step-by-step\nargument can be causal, as in:\n\nYou have decided not to go to college;\n\nIf you don\u2019t go to college, you won\u2019t get a degree;\n\nIf you don\u2019t get a degree, you won\u2019t get a good job;\n\nIf you don\u2019t get a good job, you won\u2019t be able to enjoy\nlife;\n\nBut you should be able to enjoy life;\n\nSo, you should go to college.\n\nThe weakness in this argument, the reason why it is a fallacy, lies in\nthe second and third causal claims. The series of small steps that\nlead from an acceptable starting point to an unacceptable conclusion\nmay also depend on vague terms rather than causal relations. Lack of\nclear boundaries is what enables the puzzling slippery slope arguments\nknown as \u201cthe beard\u201d and \u201cthe heap.\u201d In the\nformer, a person with a full beard eventually becomes beardless as\nhairs of the beard are removed one-by-one; but because the term\n\u2018beard\u2019 is vague it is unclear at which intermediate point\nwe are to say that the man is now beardless. Hence, at each step in\nthe argument until the final hair-plucking, we should continue to\nconclude that the man is bearded. In the second case, because\n\u2018heap\u2019 is vague, it is unclear at what point piling\nscattered stones together makes them a heap of stones: if it is not a\nheap to begin with, adding one more stone will not make it a heap,\netc. In both these cases apparently good reasoning leads to a false\nconclusion.\n\nMany other fallacies have been named and discussed, some of them quite\ndifferent from the ones mentioned above, others interesting and novel\nvariations of the above. Some of these will be mentioned in the review\nof historical and contemporary sources that follows.\n",
