    "main_text": "The Frankfurt School: Origins, Influences, and Development || The Dialectic of Enlightenment\n1.5 The Dialectic of Enlightenment\n\nThe critique of mass culture took its most dramatic form in the\nchapter on the \u201cculture industry\u201d in Horkheimer and\nAdorno\u2019s Dialectic of Enlightenment (first circulated\nin 1944 and published in 1947). They introduced the term\n\u201cculture industry\u201d to underline the fact that \u201cmass\nculture\u201d is not something \u201cthe masses\u201d spontaneously\ngenerate (Adorno 1967b [1991, 98]), but is manufactured using the same\nstandardized and profit-oriented methods as any industrial production\nmethod. In this sense, culture is no longer a relatively autonomous\nrealm of meaning (that might aim, at its best, at beauty, freedom, and\ntruth) or source of critical awareness, but is thoroughly commodified\nby the \u201cdistraction factories\u201d of the culture industry.\n\u201cCultural entities typical of the culture industry are no longer\nalso commodities, they are commodities through and\nthrough\u201d (ibid., 129). Entertainment replaces experience,\nnumbing the audience\u2019s capacity for critical thought and\nreconciling them to the status quo in a form of domination far more\nsubtle than direct tyranny.\n\nIn this way, Dialectic of Enlightenment, which is perhaps the\nmost influential text by Frankfurt School philosophers, analyzes two\nforms of mass society, fascist Germany and the United States, focusing\nprimarily on the latter. Co-authored by Horkheimer and Adorno between\n1939 and 1944 at the height of Nazi rule and World War II, the text\nopens with these lines:\n\nEnlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of\nthought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and\ninstalling them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth is\nradiant with triumphant calamity (1947 [2002, 1]).\n\n\nThe book is a genealogy of reason that traces its self-destruction\nfrom the dawn of human history to the present. Reason was supposed to\nliberate human beings. Instead, in the dominant form it takes as\ninstrumental rationality, it has become the primary instrument of\ntheir domination. With reason taking this form, humans lose their\ncapacity for critical reflection as their thinking is increasingly\noriented solely toward self-preservation within a system in which they\nare powerless. \u201cThought is reified as an autonomous, automatic\nprocess, aping the machine it has itself produced, so that it can\nfinally be replaced by the machine\u201d (ibid., 19).\n\nThe root of the catastrophic dynamic lies not just with modernity or\ncapitalism, but goes back to humanity\u2019s earliest attempts to\ndominate nature. A core thesis of the book is that myth and\nenlightenment are entwined. The process of enlightenment began with\nthe earliest attempts to overcome \u201cmythic fear\u201d as a way\nof explaining the unknown and mitigating threats from nature. This\nanthropological claim about enlightenment is combined with a\nhistorical claim about the Enlightenment and the rise of modern\nscience and technology. This is when instrumental rationality truly\ncomes to dominate, as means-end calculation is the kind of reasoning\nrequired for capitalist production and efficient bureaucracy.\n\u201cEnlightenment is totalitarian\u201d (ibid., 50), Adorno and\nHorkheimer argue; it subsumes everything under its dissolvent\nrationality. In this way, enlightenment reverts back to myth.\n\nThe book represents a shift away from the critique of political\neconomy, indebted to Marx, to the critique of instrumental reason,\nindebted to Weber (Benhabib 1986, 149\u2013163). Although this shift\nis sometimes attributed to the growing pessimism of its authors during\nNational Socialism, it was also motivated by Pollock\u2019s analysis\nof the shift from nineteenth-century liberal capitalism to\n\u201cstate capitalism\u201d: increased intervention by the state\ninto the economy meant that the primacy of the economy posited by Marx\nhad been replaced by the primacy of politics (1941). This claim\nsupported the focus in Dialectic of Enlightenment on the\nadministered control of society by the state apparatus. The book\npaints a bleak picture of a society in which people live\n\u201ctotally administered lives\u201d under the sway of efficient\nand calculating institutions. For the sake of self-preservation, they\nadapt themselves entirely to this apparatus. All the while the culture\nindustry, as an \u201corgan of mass deception,\u201d keeps them\nentertained at the price of numbing their critical capacities,\nproducing conformity, and undermining any sense of individuality or\ncapacity for autonomy. The book also represents a shift away from the\nearlier idea of critical theory as interdisciplinary social theory,\nwhich could marshal the findings of empirical social science toward\nthe practical aim of emancipation, and more toward speculative\nhistory. In the story they tell, the effects of domination are so\nubiquitous that every form of scientific knowledge is corrupted.\n\nIf Horkheimer and Adorno\u2019s Dialectic of Enlightenment\nwas supposed to provide the grounds for a positive concept of\nenlightenment \u2013 as they maintained in its preface (1947 [2002,\nxviii]) \u2013 many critics have wondered what that is supposed to be\n(Wellmer 1983). Habermas would later argue that the authors needed to\nleave \u201cat least one rational criterion intact for their\nexplanation of the corruption of all rational criteria\u201d\nin order to \u201cset the normative foundations of critical social\ntheory;\u201d but they failed to do so (1985 [1987, 127\u20139]; see\nalso Benhabib 1986).\n\nReappraisals of the text in recent decades range from defending its\napproach as a form of world-disclosive critique (Kompridis 2006) that\nreveals our familiar social world as pathological by using techniques\nlike \u201crhetorical condensation\u201d (Honneth 1998), to reading\nit as developing a dialectical conception of progress \u2013 not\nsimply a history of decline \u2013 aimed at making us more aware of\nthe inevitable entanglement of reason with power (Allen 2014, 2016),\nand attempts to build on the chapter on antisemitism, which analyzes\nits social function in providing a \u201crelease valve\u201d that\nallows rage to be \u201cvented on those who are both conspicuous and\nunprotected\u201d (1947 [2002, 140]), thereby stabilizing domination\nby channeling potential resistance to social suffering into hatred of\na group (Rabinbach 2000, Rensmann 2017).\n\nHerbert Marcuse\u2019s influential book One-Dimensional Man\n(1964) \u2013 best summarized by its subtitle, Studies in the\nIdeology of Advanced Industrial Society \u2013 can be read as an\nattempt to update Dialectic of Enlightenment in the form of a\ndiagnosis of U.S. society and its perfected mechanisms of pacification\nand social control, ranging from art, sexuality, and politics to\nphilosophy and the very act of thinking. Marcuse argues that all forms\nof critical thought and practice, having been wholly integrated into\nthe wasteful, dehumanizing, profit-seeking, imperialist logic of\nadvanced capitalism, are subsumed by one-dimensional ideology, a\n\u201cflattening out of the antagonism between culture and social\nreality\u201d (61).\n\nMarcuse developed his influential concept of \u201crepressive\ndesublimation\u201d to explain how the manipulated need for instant\ngratification has sanitized any transgressive forces within the\ndomains of sexuality and art. Prior to the rise of the \u201caffluent\nsociety,\u201d art contained a transcendent capacity in the sense\nthat it thought of, engaged with, and appropriated the idea of\nbreaking out of the world in which one lived and embodied the hope for\na better one to replace it. Within late capitalism, art has lost this\ncritical aspect and dissolved into consumer culture and technological\nrationality, masking the \u201csurplus repression\u201d that shapes\nhuman instincts and needs in line with the functional requirements of\nsocial domination and the reproduction of the status quo.\n\nMarcuse\u2019s work has been criticized for its totalizing diagnosis\nof domination, his reliance on an objectivist account of human nature\nand needs, and the paternalistic or even authoritarian implications\nthat possibly result from combining these two elements (Jaeggi 2014\n[2018, 104\u2013108]). Nonetheless, it has remained an important\nreference point for the critique of technology (Feenberg 2023a, 2023b,\nFong 2016, Ch. 5) and of false needs, and of new right-wing forms of\n\u201crepressive desublimation\u201d that affirm the status quo in a\ntransgressive mode (Brown 2019, 165\u2013169). Regardless of how one\ntoday assesses Marcuse\u2019s concrete analyses, his work exemplifies\na tension that all critical theories have to address between the\ndominating forces of one-dimensionality and the possibility of\nbreaking free of them.\n\nFirst-generation critical theorists posited various responses to their\nown bleak diagnoses of society from the 1940s to the 1960s. Marcuse\nsupported rebellious social movements in the 1960s and 1970s, in\ncontrast to other leading representatives of critical theory who kept\na conspicuous distance. In One-Dimensional Man, he placed\nhope for overcoming the repressive, one-dimensional society in a\n\u201cGreat Refusal\u201d to abide by its norms, as carried out by\nthe \u201csubstratum of the outcasts and outsiders, the exploited and\npersecuted of other races and other colors, the unemployed and the\nunemployable\u201d (1964, 256). He later expressed solidarity with,\nand saw as examples of this refusal in, both the global student\nmovement (1968, 119) and the feminist movement with its aim of\novercoming dominant forms of aggressive masculinity (1974). He\nlikewise praised counter-cultural movements for expressing sexual,\nmoral, and political rebellion in a non-aggressive form of life that\nmight generate a total change in values (1967). For Marcuse,\nemancipation involves a new morality that fulfills the vital needs for\njoy and happiness and encompasses an aesthetic-erotic dimension that\nis foreshadowed in alternative artistic tastes and new social and\ncultural practices. While Horkheimer and Adorno were less supportive\nof rebellious social movements, they did become important\ninstitutional figures and public intellectuals after their return to\nGermany (M\u00fcller-Doohm 2003, part IV; Demirovi\u0107 2016).\nAdorno\u2019s radio addresses in particular can be viewed as an\nattempt to educate the public for autonomy and so as a kind of\nresponse to their own bleak diagnoses of society.\n\nBut the core of Adorno\u2019s response, from the early essay on the\nculture industry to his posthumously published Aesthetic\nTheory (1970), was to posit that \u201cautonomous\u201d or\n\u201cauthentic\u201d art, by contrast to the products of the\nculture industry, maintains a utopian impulse insofar as it points\nbeyond, and provides a moment of resistance to, the status quo. For\nexample, atonal music by composers like Arnold Schoenberg generates\ndissonance in the listener by challenging the unity of the whole found\nin more harmonious music. Adorno maintained that such art, in\nchallenging aesthetic norms and conventions, can provide aesthetic\nexperiences that are resistant to the homogenizing forces of the\nculture industry. Critics of this turn to the aesthetic have wondered\nhow this is supposed to provide a sound basis for a critical theory of\nsociety (Benhabib 1986, 222).\n\nBut one can argue that Adorno\u2019s later work was an attempt to\npush against that kind of grounding for critical theory. The title of\nAdorno\u2019s 1966 magnum opus, Negative Dialectics (1966a),\nrefers to a methodology that takes from traditional Hegelian\ndialectics the emphasis on difference and mediation but abandons the\nattempt to overcome difference through a unifying synthesis. Instead,\ntaking up an argument already developed in Dialectic of\nEnlightenment, Adorno argues that \u201cidentity thinking\u201d\nand the \u201cidentity principle\u201d have been at the basis of\nhumanity\u2019s destructive project of cognitive as well as practical\ndomination of external as well as internal nature, thereby linking the\nphilosophical to the social oppression of particularity. Adorno\nrejects \u201cidentity thinking\u201d in favor of affirming the\nnegative, namely \u201cnon-identity,\u201d that is, the irreducible\nparticularity of objects, experiences, and persons that cannot be\nsubsumed under concepts.\n\nThis approach undermines the totalizing aspirations of theoretical\nsystems in philosophy as traditionally understood. The struggle to\nrecognize that which is nonidentical is not only an epistemological\nbut also an ethical and political project that seeks to do justice to\nboth the object and the subject of cognition in their irreducible\nindividuality (Bernstein 2001). Linking epistemology and the\nphilosophy of language to critical theory of society, this leads\nAdorno to reject not only Hegel\u2019s affirmative synthesis but also\nHeideggerian ontology and Kantian dualism. Methodologically, Adorno\nexplores alternative ways of thinking about how to use and develop\nphilosophical concepts, taking up the Benjaminian notion of\nconstellation and developing \u201ccritical models\u201d in order to\narticulate the complexity of experience, and suffering, without\nreducing or constraining it. In Adorno\u2019s view, negative\ndialectics is a form of immanent critique engaged in a dynamic and\ntransformative process, as it \u201cmust transform the concepts which\nit brings, as it were, from outside into those which the object has of\nitself, into what the object, left to itself, seeks to be, and\nconfront it with what it is\u201d (Adorno 1957 [1976, 69]). In his\ncultural criticism and interventions in public debates, Adorno follows\nthis paradigm by exploring how concrete experiences exemplify a form\nof social domination that is obscured by mass culture but also open up\nthe possibility of transcending reified consciousness by articulating\nthe internal contradictions within social reality.\n",
