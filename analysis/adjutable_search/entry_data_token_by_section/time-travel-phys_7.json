Computational Models\n\nAn alternative approach to time travel (initiated by Deutsch 1991)\nabstracts away from the idealized toy models described\n above.[6]\n This computational approach considers instead the evolution of bits\n(simple physical systems with two discrete states) through a network\nof interactions, which can be represented by a circuit diagram with\ngates corresponding to the interactions. Motivated by the possibility\nof CTCs, Deutsch proposed adding a new kind of channel that connects\nthe output of a given gate back to its\ninput\u2014in essence, a backwards-time step. More\nconcretely, given a gate that takes \\(n\\) bits as input, we can\nimagine taking some number \\(i \\lt n\\) of these bits through a channel\nthat loops back and then do double-duty as inputs. Consistency\nrequires that the state of these \\(i\\) bits is the same for output and\ninput. (We will consider an illustration of this kind of system in the\nnext section.) Working through examples of circuit diagrams with a CTC\nchannel leads to similar treatments of Consistency and\nUnderdetermination as the discussion above (see, e.g.,\nWallace 2012: \u00a7 10.6). But the approach offers two new insights\n(both originally due to Deutsch): the Easy Knowledge paradox,\nand a particularly clear extension to time travel in quantum\nmechanics.\n\nA computer equipped with a CTC channel can exploit the need to find\nconsistent evolution to solve remarkably hard problems. (This is quite\ndifferent than the first idea that comes to mind to enhance\ncomputational power: namely to just devote more time to a computation,\nand then send the result back on the CTC to an earlier state.) The\ngate in a circuit incorporating a CTC implements a function from the\ninput bits to the output bits, under the constraint that the output\nand input match the i bits going through the CTC channel.\nThis requires, in effect, finding the fixed point of the relevant\nfunction. Given the generality of the model, there are few limits on\nthe functions that could be implemented on the CTC circuit. Nature has\nto solve a hard computational problem just to ensure consistent\nevolution. This can then be extended to other complex computational\nproblems\u2014leading, more precisely, to solutions of\nNP-complete problems in polynomial time (see Aaronson\n2013: Chapter 20 for an overview and further references). The limits\nimposed by computational complexity are an essential part of our\nepistemic situation, and computers with CTCs would radically change\nthis.\n",
