    "main_text": "Political theory\n7. Political theory\n\nIn Jerusalem, or on Religious Power and Judaism Mendelssohn\ndistinguishes church and state in order to demonstrate the salutary\nharmony between them and thus the need for tolerance. In the first\npart of the essay he accordingly argues that neither the state nor\nreligion can legitimately coerce human conscience and, in the second\npart, he maintains that this argument against \u201creligious\npower\u201d is supported by Judaism. The second point was no less\ncontroversial than the first, especially since many Jewish elders and\nrabbis maintained a right to excommunicate. But Mendelssohn counters\n\u2014 apparently erroneously \u2014 that the practice is not\ninherent in \u201cancient, original Judaism\u201d but rather\nborrowed in the course of time from Christianity.\n\nFar from separating temporal and spiritual concerns to distinguish\nstate and church (as Locke did), Mendelssohn insists that \u201cour\nwelfare in this life is \u2026 one and the same as [our] eternal\nfelicity in the future\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 39). Nor\ndoes he base the distinction between church and state on the\ndifference between convictions and actions. \u201cBoth state and\nchurch have as their object actions as well as convictions, the former\ninsofar as they are based on the relations between man and nature, the\nlatter insofar as they are based on the relations between nature and\nGod\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 56f). As far as convictions\nare concerned, neither church nor state can coerce; \u201cfor\nhere,\u201d as noted earlier, \u201cthe state has no other means of\nacting effectively than the church does. Both must teach, instruct,\nencourage, motivate\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 61). What\ncontributes mightily to their potential for mutual reinforcement is\nthe fact that there is also no difference in the make-up of the\nconvictions and duties themselves. The only difference between church\nand state in the matter of convictions is their ultimate sanction.\nThus, the moral philosopher will arrive at the same system of duties\nas the person who sees them as expressions of the divine; religion\n\u201conly gives those same duties and obligations a more exalted\nsanction\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 58). Matters\nare different when it comes to actions where the state can and must\ncoerce, namely, when society\u2019s size and complexity \u201cmake\nit impossible to govern by convictions alone, [and] the state will\nhave to resort to public measures, coercive laws, punishments of\ncrime, and rewards of merit\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 43).\nHerein lies for Mendelssohn the basic difference between state and\nchurch: civil society has, as the product of a social contract, the\nright to coercion, religious society has no such right. \u201cThe\nstate has physical power and uses it when necessary; the\npower of religion is love and beneficence\u201d\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 45).\n\nInsofar as Mendelssohn\u2019s argument for religious tolerance has a\nreligious premise, i.e., insofar as duties to others are founded upon\nthe relation to God (\u201cthe more exalted sanction,\u201d cited\nabove), it is less advantageous, it has been argued, than Kant\u2019s\nargument that rests simply on the innate right to freedom (Guyer\n2018c). An analogous challenge from a Kantian perspective concerns the\nimplications of Mendelssohn\u2019s defense of speculation as a source\nof reason\u2019s authority for his view of history.\nMendelssohn\u2019s rejection of the idea of moral progress in history\nand Kant\u2019s endorsement of the idea coincide, it is argued (Sweet\n2018), precisely with the contrast between Mendelssohn\u2019s\nacceptance of an authority external to reason and Kant\u2019s\ninsistence upon a self-legislating reason. For discussion of\nKant\u2019s criticisms of Mendelssohn\u2019s\n\u201cabderitism\u201d (non-progressivism), see Guyer 2020,\n321\u2013337.\n\nIn Jerusalem, Mendelssohn argues that Judaism is, at bottom,\na natural religion, containing no revealed truths not available to\nunaided reason. Occasionally, as Allan Arkush points out\n(Jerusalem (1983), p. 20), he speaks more guardedly,\nrestricting this claim to the \u201cessentials\u201d of Judaism.\nEven with such qualifications, however, it is apparent that\nMendelssohn approaches Judaism and its history with a more or less\nDeist view that the original, ancient faith confirmed nothing more\nthan rational truths. Nonetheless, he combines this rationalist\napproach with a conception of revelation that underscores the\ndistinctiveness of Judaism and secures Jewish believers their destiny\nas God\u2019s chosen people. For, while the Sinaitic revelation\ncontains no supernatural truths, it does prescribe a way of life, the\npractice of which stands to benefit all mankind. (The interpretation\nof revelation strictly as legislation and not as adding to the store\nof truths is very likely borrowed, with qualifications, from Spinoza).\n\u201cJudaism boasts of no exclusive revelation of eternal\ntruths that are indispensable to salvation, of no revealed religion in\nthe sense in which that term is usually understood. Revealed\nreligion is one thing, revealed legislation,\nanother\u201d (Jerusalem (1983), p. 97). This gloss hardly\ndoes justice to Jerusalem and its significance; for further\ndiscussion, see, for example, Arkush 1994, Berghahn 2001, Gottlieb\n2011, McQuillan 2014, Rosenstock 2010, Pecina 2016, Sacks 2017, and\nGuyer 2020.\n",
