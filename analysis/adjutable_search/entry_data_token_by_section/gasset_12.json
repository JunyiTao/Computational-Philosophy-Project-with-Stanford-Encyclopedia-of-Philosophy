    "main_text": "Human Reality and Historical Reason\n7. Human Reality and Historical Reason\n\nHistory narrates the actions of individuals in society. In the world\nof physical objects, things change, but in the social world of\nindividuals, events happen. References to historical reality, or to\nhistorical time, then, are defined in terms of human motives, actions,\nand reactions and therefore as unique events. What, then, are\nhistorical facts? To Ortega, \u201call knowledge of facts\u201d as\n\u201cisolated\u201d data, \u201cis, to be precise,\nincomprehensible and can be justified only when used in the service of\ntheory\u201d. Our capacity to comprehend the connectedness in the\nexternal world is served best \u201cin the synthesis of facts\u201d,\nfor \u201cthe unity of facts\u201d is \u201cfound not in\nthemselves\u201d but is found \u201cin the mind of an\nindividual\u201d (Obras, I: 316\u201317). For Ortega,\nhistorical reasoning thus has a specific form of narration.\n\n\nIn short, the reasoning, the reason, which sheds light here,\nconsists in a narrative reason. In order to comprehend anything human,\nbe it personal, or collective, it is necessary to tell its\nhistory\u2026. Life only returns a small degree of transparency in\nthe presence of historical reason. (Obras, VI:\n40)\n\n\nThese statements were based on the recognition that historical time\ndiffers from time in nature. Clearly, any natural phenomenon occurs in\ntime. Nevertheless, references to historical reality or to a\nhistorical time often have been defined in terms of human motives,\nactions and reactions. For this reason, historical events have often\nbeen characterized as unique events, in contrast to the laws of nature\nwhere similar elements meet under similar circumstances. The history\nof the individual therefore means more than mere change in time.\nHistorical time becomes meaningful through human actions. In\nconnecting historical reasoning to human actions, critical philosophy\nof history sought to disclose the mind\u2019s activity as a tangible\nprocess. As with Dilthey, Croce, and later, Collingwood, Ortega in his\nphilosophical orientation was affiliated with the tradition which, by\nway of contrast with classical British empiricism, portrayed the human\nmind in active terms; in other words, the Neo-Kantian tradition\ntreated mental activity as creative and self-determining, displaying a\nconstructive role in human experience rather than passively responding\nin mechanical fashion to the promptings of external stimuli. Kant had\nalready established that all knowledge is a function of the human\nmind. The mind, by means of its own a priori forms,\nstructures the entire domain of knowledge. This formal extension of\nthe domain of mental activity appealed to Ortega. The particular\nimportance Ortega ascribed to history, and his contention that the\nmind\u2019s character had been radically misinterpreted by empiricist\nphilosophers, reflected the presupposition underlying his portrayal of\nthe individual as an autonomous historical agent. He viewed the\nempirical, or positivistic, objective of formulating a theory of human\nnature in accordance with principles drawn from the physical sciences\nas providing faulty findings. In adopting this position, one assumes\nthat human behavior becomes subject to invariant, universal\nregularities, and that explanations necessarily consist in subsuming\nwhat occurs beneath \u201ca general law of nature\u201d. Against\nsuch a view, Ortega argued that human nature involves a continual\nprocess of reflective self-transformation which reveals individuals to\nbe continually modifying and reformulating their experiences. In this\nconnection, the notion of a fixed human character, conforming to\nimmutable principles which are valid for all individuals during all\nhistorical periods, was unacceptable to him.\n\nTo explain reality, Ortega continued, the natural sciences, in their\nconcern with the existence of objects in natural phenomena, aim at\ndiscovering the general concepts or the natural laws under which these\nobjects may be subsumed. In order to understand the relationship\nbetween human life and reality, therefore, the individual must escape\nfrom what he labels, \u201cthe terrorism of the laboratory\u201d.\nThrough his various readings of Kant, Ortega learned that the\nautonomous mind must liberate the self from the enslavement of our\nempirical existence by nature. To avert compounding the ontological\ndistinctions he thought should be made between a philosophy of\nphysical nature and a philosophy of human nature, Ortega maintained\nthat \u201cman has no nature\u201d. The individual must liberate\nhimself or herself from the shackles of the natural scientists for the\nlatter are too involved with general, abstract concepts of nature, and\n\u201cman has no nature\u201d. In this sense, according to Ortega,\nthe generalized interpretations of the natural scientists exclude the\nmost essential element of human reality: the life of the individual.\nIn denaturalizing \u201cman\u201d, a question still remains for us:\nif the individual has no nature, what does he or she have? \u201cMan\nhas history\u201d Ortega replies. \u201cMan lives\u201d, he\ncontinues, and, as a \u201cliving being\u201d, the individual\nrelates to other \u201cliving beings\u201d so that vital, operative\nfactors are set in motion\u2014the \u201cliving experience of\nman\u201d. Ortega\u2019s departure from physics and mathematics\u2019 universal\nperspective of reality shows us that his dictum, \u201cman, in word,\nhas no nature; what he has is \u2026history\u201d, completes the\nalienation of the individual from nature and nature from the\nindividual. This abrupt separation of individual and nature, in\naddition to his rejection of rational concepts as producing any valid\nknowledge of reality, reaffirms Ortega\u2019s denial of universal,\nfundamental principles of reality and thus aligns him on the\nhumanistic side of the natural sciences\u2014human sciences\ndichotomy. What is real and what has history comprises what has been\ndisclosed by human beings. History, therefore, \u201csensu\nstricto\u201d constitutes \u201chuman history\u201d. For\nhistory \u201cis the reality of man. He has no other. Through history\nhe has made himself such as he is\u201d. Ortega\u2019s later emphasis on\nthe \u201coriginal autochthonous\u201d basis of \u201chistorical\nreason\u201d, insisted both on the systematic quality of history\nand on the \u201ctranscendent\u201d character of physical reason\n(Obras, IX: 83\u201386, 88\u201389). To Ortega, human life is\n\u201cnot a thing\u201d but \u201ca drama\u201d; human life\n\u201cis a gerund, not a participle: a faciendum, not a\nfactum\u201d. Finally, as expressed differently by\nCollingwood: \u201cwhat nature is to things, history, as res\ngestae, is to man\u2026. Man finds that he has no nature other\nthan what he has done himself\u201d. For Collingwood, history is the\nstudy of \u201cres gestae: actions of human beings done in\nthe past\u201d; and, because it studies human activity, it is the\nstudy of purposive activity (Obras, VI: 32\u201333, 41;\nCollingwood 1948 [1956: 9]; 1921 [1966:19\u201320]).\n",
