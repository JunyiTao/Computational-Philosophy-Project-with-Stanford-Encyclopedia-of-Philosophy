    "main_text": "Pains and Pleasures || Interests\n3.1 Interests\n\nIn Helv\u00e9tius\u2019 account \u201cinterest\u201d lies at the\nepicentre of moral science, but Bentham recognised that the concept\nonly had meaning, like other fictitious entities in ethics such as\n\u201cdesire\u201d and \u201cmotive\u201d, when redefined in terms\nof the avoidance of pains and acquisition of pleasures (1970, 12;\n1838\u201343, VIII, 290). In general he followed Adam Smith in\nbelieving the individual to be the best judge of his or her own\ninterests, but the simplicity of this proposition is deceptive (see\nEngelmann 2001).\n\nFirst, a person\u2019s consideration of her interest involves\nexpectations or mental projections of the future, not\nactually existing material interests. This involves the individual in\nimagining what will occur if she were to act in a certain\nmanner. The specific expectations that attend the consideration of an\naction may be shaped by a myriad of external considerations, as well\nas the agent\u2019s own predilections and preferences. For Bentham,\nthe most important elements of the external environment in which a\nperson imagines outcomes are the penalties and rewards laid down by\nlaw and those deriving from other educative and moral institutional\narrangements and practices, including the sanction exercised by public\nopinion. In this sense, law and other agencies may be used to\nconstruct interests by providing individuals with the motives to\npursue courses of action beneficial to the community. It is the\nindividual who then must correctly perceive where her interests lie;\nshe must imagine the expected outcomes the legislator has determined.\nThe result is that Bentham\u2019s material view of pains and\npleasures as the factors which define \u201cinterest\u201d tends to\nevaporate in favour of interests composed of imagined (though not\nimaginary) apprehensions and expectations about the future.\n\nSecond, Bentham recognised that explaining action in terms of interest\nis potentially circular. If we mean by acting according to interest,\nacting selfishly, then the statement \u201cAgents act in accordance\nwith their self-interest\u201d, is false. If we mean, acting to\npursue our interest in the widest sense, then the statement is\ntautological (2010b, 93n). In this respect, the validity of the\n\u201cself-preference principle\u201d\u2014the assumption that\nself-interest is the motivation of all human action\u2014is\nquestionable. Bentham recognised the possibility of altruistic\nactions, and frequently alluded to his own philanthropy when\nrecommending schemes to further the public good. Moreover, in\nIPML he held that sympathy was a \u201cprimeval and constant\nsource\u201d of pleasure and action (1970, 61), and later, in\nDeontology, elevated it to his list of sanctions as a source\nof pain and pleasure (1983a, 84, 183, 201, 203\u20134). However, if\nnot all action is motivated by self-interest in the narrow or strict\nmeaning of the term, then how far can the self-preference principle be\nconsidered a reliable guide for the legislator in constructing\nmotives? Bentham\u2019s answer, probably influenced by Hume\u2019s\nview of the matter, is that the self-preference principle is a sound\ngeneralisation. While it is not true that everyone always acts in his\nor her self-interest, it is best that the legislator design\ninstitutions and law as if this were in fact true. Self-interested\nacts are the norm; altruism is the exception. As he explained it in\nthe Constitutional Code (1830), even if the self-preference\nprinciple \u201cheld good in no more than a bare majority, of the\nwhole number of instances, it would suffice for every practical\npurpose, in the character of a ground for all political\narrangements\u201d (1838\u201343, IX, 6).\n\nThird, although individuals may in general be the best judges of their\nown interests, they may not always judge wisely. This creates a\ndisjunction between the perception of their interest and their\n\u201creal\u201d interest. Since the \u201cpublic interest\u201d\nis a fictitious entity which represents nothing more than the\naggregate of individual interests (1970, 12), an effective legislator\nmust have a fairly accurate understanding of the interests of those\nindividuals that constitute the community, of what will motivate them\nto act in the desired ways (especially in criminal law). But if people\nincorrectly perceive their interests, then the legislator may be\nmisled in constructing the appropriate motivation. Clearly, the\nknowledge needed by the legislator (in order to be effective in\nconstructing adequate motives to direct individual actions) is of\npeople\u2019s apparent interests, while the legislator\u2019s\nobjective is to further their \u201creal\u201d interests, that is,\nwhat they would choose if they were fully rational and informed. This\nmeans that assessing the value of the constituent elements of interest\n(pains and pleasures) is a tricky business for the legislator; he must\naccurately observe the ways people behave, deduce the motives behind\ntheir actions, and encompass this knowledge in the sanctions of law.\nYet these same observations of human behaviour may not also be\nreliable guides to the \u201creal\u201d interests of individuals,\nwhich must be determined on other grounds. This is why some modern day\nutilitarians focus on \u201cpreferences\u201d, that is on the\nsubjectively expressed opinion of the individual as to what she\nthinks will be pleasurable or painful (see Bykvist 2013).\n\nBentham addressed the potential disjunction between an agent\u2019s\nperception of her interest and her real interest in his writings on\nindirect law, which he described as \u201ca secret plan of connected\nand long-concerted operations to be executed in the way of a stratagem\nor petite guerre\u201d (2010b, 233). The aim is to tell\nindividuals what they should not do, but also to provide them with\nmotives (pains and pleasures in prospect) sufficient to divert their\ndesires into channels best designed to serve the public interest.\nCodes of behaviour and other \u201cimplements of moral\ninstruction\u201d, such as texts of \u201chistory, biography, novels\nand dramatic compositions\u201d (UC lxxxvii, 18\u201319), could be\nutilised to divert people from inclinations damaging to themselves and\nothers and to teach them to derive pleasure from benevolence. In this\nway government could educate its citizens to make more effective\nchoices, or at least guide them into more appropriate paths to achieve\ntheir real interests (1838\u201343, I, 161).\n",
