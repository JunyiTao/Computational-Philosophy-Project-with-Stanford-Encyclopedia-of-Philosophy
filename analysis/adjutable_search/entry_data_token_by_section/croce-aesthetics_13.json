    "main_text": "Problems || Acting versus Contemplation\n10.1 Acting versus Contemplation\n\nThe equation of intuition with expression as at section 4.3 simply is\nnot, in end, plausible. C. J. Ducasse (1929) put his finger on it.\nWhen we look at a vase full of flowers, it simply does not matter how\nclosely or in what manner we attend to it; we do not create a\n\u2018work of art\u2019 unless we draw or paint it. Croce has lost\nsight of the ordinary sense of passively contemplating and\ndoing something; between reading and writing, looking and\ndrawing, listening and playing, dancing and watching. Of course all\nthe first members of these pairs involve a mental action of a\nkind, and there are important connections between the first members\nand the corresponding seconds\u2014perhaps in terms of what Berenson\ncalls ideated sensations\u2014but that is not to say that\nthere are not philosophically crucial distinctions between them.\n",
