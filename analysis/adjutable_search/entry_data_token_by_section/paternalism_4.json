    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || Weak vs. strong paternalism\n2.3 Weak vs. strong paternalism\n\nA weak paternalist believes that it is legitimate to interfere with\nthe means that agents choose to achieve their ends, if those means are\nlikely to defeat those ends. So if a person really prefers safety to\nconvenience then it is legitimate to force them to wear seatbelts. A\nstrong paternalist believes that people may have mistaken, confused or\nirrational ends and it is legitimate to interfere to prevent them from\nachieving those ends. If a person really prefers the wind rustling\nthrough their hair to increased safety it is legitimate to make them\nwear helmets while motorcycling because their ends are irrational or\nmistaken. If one is a weak but not a strong paternalist we may\nonly interfere with mistakes about the facts not with mistakes about\nvalues. So if a person tries to jump out of a window believing he will\nfloat gently to the ground we may restrain him. If he jumps because he\nbelieves that it is important to be spontaneous we may not.\n",
