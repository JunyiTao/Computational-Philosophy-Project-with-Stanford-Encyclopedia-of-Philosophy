    "main_text": "The Ergodic Hierarchy and Statistical Mechanics\n4. The Ergodic Hierarchy and Statistical Mechanics\n\nThe concepts of EH, and in particular ergodicity itself, play\nimportant roles in the foundation of statistical mechanics (SM). In\nthis section we review what these roles are.\n\nA discussion of SM faces an immediate problem.\nFoundational debates in many other fields of physics can take as their\npoint of departure a generally accepted formalism. Things are\ndifferent in SM. Unlike, say, relativity theory,\nSM has not yet found a generally accepted theoretical framework, let\nalone a canonical\n formulation.[12]\n What we find in SM is plethora of different approaches and schools,\neach with its own programme and mathematical\n apparatus.[13]\n However, all these schools use (slight variants) of either of two\ntheoretical frameworks, one of which can be associated with Boltzmann\n(1877) and the other with Gibbs (1902), and can thereby be classify\neither as \u2018Boltzmannian\u2019 or \u2018Gibbsian\u2019. For\nthis reason we divide our presentation of SM into a two parts, one for\neach of these families of approaches.\n\nBefore delving into a discussion of these theories, let us briefly\nreview the basic tenets of SM by dint of a common example. Consider a\ngas that is confined to the left half of a box. Now remove the barrier\nseparating the two halves of the box. As a result, the gas quickly\ndisperses, and it continues to do so until it uniformly fills the\nentire box. The gas has approached equilibrium. This raises two\nquestions. First, how is equilibrium characterised? That is, what does\nit take for a system to be in equilibrium? Second, how do we\ncharacterise the approach to equilibrium? That is, what are the\nsalient features of the approach to equilibrium and what features of a\nsystem make it behave in this way? These questions are addressed in\ntwo subdisciplines of SM: equilibrium SM and non-equilibrium SM.\n\nThere are two different ways of describing processes like the\nspreading of a gas. Thermodynamics describes the system using a few\nmacroscopic variables (in the case of the gas pressure, volume and\ntemperature), while disregarding the microscopic\nconstitution of the gas. As far as thermodynamics is concerned matter\ncould be a continuum rather than consisting of particles\u2014it just\nwould not make any difference. For this reason thermodynamics is\ncalled a \u2018macro theory\u2019.\n\nThe cornerstone of thermodynamics is the so-called Second Law of\nthermodynamics. This law describes one of the salient features of the\nabove process: its unidirectionality. We see gases spread\u2014i.e.,\nwe see them evolving towards equilibrium\u2014but we never observe\ngases spontaneously reverting to the left half of a box\u2014i.e., we\nnever see them move away from equilibrium when left alone. And this is\nnot a specific feature of gases. In fact, not only gases but also all\nother macroscopic systems behave in this way, irrespective of their\nspecific makeup. This fact is enshrined in the Second Law of\nthermodynamics, which, roughly, states that transitions from\nequilibrium to non-equilibrium states cannot occur in isolated\nsystems, which is the same as saying that entropy cannot decrease in\nisolated systems (where a system is isolated if it has no interaction\nwith its environment: there is no heat exchange, no one is compressing\nthe gas, etc.).\n\nBut there is an altogether different way of looking at that same gas;\nthat is, as consisting of a large number of molecules (a vessel on a\nlaboratory table contains something like \\(10^{23}\\) molecules). These\nmolecules bounce around under the influence of the forces exerted onto\nthem when they crash into the walls of the vessel and collide with\neach other. The motion of each molecule is governed by the laws of\nclassical mechanics in the same way as the motion of the bouncing\nball. So rather than attributing some macro variables to the gas and\nfocussing on them, we could try to understand the gas\u2019 behaviour\nby studying the dynamics of its micro constituents.\n\nThis raises the question of how the two ways of looking at the gas fit\ntogether. Since neither the thermodynamic nor the mechanical approach\nis in any way privileged, both have to lead to the same conclusions.\nStatistical mechanics is the discipline that addresses this task. From\na more abstract point of view we can therefore also say that SM is the\nstudy of the connection between micro-physics and macro-physics: it\naims to account for a system\u2019s macro behaviour in terms of the\ndynamical laws governing its microscopic constituents. The term\n\u2018statistical\u2019 in its name is owed to the fact that, as we\nwill see, a mechanical explanation can only be given if we also\nintroduce probabilistic elements into the theory.\n",
