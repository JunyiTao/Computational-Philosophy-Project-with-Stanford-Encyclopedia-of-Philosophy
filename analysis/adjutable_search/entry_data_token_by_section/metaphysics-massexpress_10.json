    "main_text": "Stuff as Distinct From Things || World-Stuff\n3.2 World-Stuff\n\nSome stuff ontologists eliminate concrete things altogether. There is\nonly stuff, objects being accidental phases of objectively\nnon-objectual stuff. Alternatively, concepts are thought of as\n\u2018cookie-cutters\u2019, which conventionally carve\npseudo-objects (cf Dummet 1981, chap 16) out of the amorphous\nworld-blob, which either is not itself an object (Sidelle 1989), or is\nthe only object there is (Horgan & Potr\u010d 2000,\n 2008).[22]\n\nAlan Sidelle (1989, 1991, 1998) argues that while stuff exists, there\nare no things which exist and actually have the essences we believe\nthey do. In 1998 he argues that we should regard the unraveling of a\nsweater, or the chopping down of a tree, not as substantial\nchanges in which things cease to be, but rather as accidental changes\nin underlying, persisting stuff (compare also Needham 2010):\n\nthe intuitive [claim] we are here considering amounts to the claim\nthat while there are trees, sweaters, and other ordinary objects, our\nordinary substance terms are not, in fact, substance terms, but pick\nout these objects according to accidental properties\u2026Being a\ntree, or a sweater, is an accidental property of something more basic.\n\n\nWhat is more basic? Stuff. Supposed substantial\nchange in objects is actually accidental change to some stuff. Sidelle\ndiagnoses the phenomenon of coincidence as a species of the problem of\nindividuation:\n\nWhether there is coincidence is fundamentally the question of whether\nthere can be more than one criterion of identity instantiated at a\ngiven location, that is, whether, for any location taken to contain an\nobject, the various seemingly possible criteria of identity can all be\nruled out as false, save one. (1998, p.\u2009441)\n\n\nHe claims that the problem of coincident entities arises not due to\nthe diversity of individuals in a region, but rather due to the fact\nthat the world as it is under-determines which principles of\nindividuation are the correct ones to employ. We can treat any\nproperty as accidental or as essential by employing different sortals,\nor nominal essences, to describe a thing. When a cow dies, we can\ndescribe this either as the accidental change in some flesh-and-bones,\nor the substantial change in a cow which is no more. Sidelle\nconcludes, in a Lockean vein, that which changes we conceive of as\nsubstantial and which as accidental is more a function of us and our\ninterests than of the way things really are (1998, p.\u2009439).\n\nSidelle goes on to note that the main cause of our philosophical\npuzzles about objects is the dogmatic assumption that there are some,\ntogether with our employing the concept object. \u201cIt is\nobjects which have made the problem, and the solution\nisn\u2019t to switch which objects we allow, but to disallow\nobjects altogether\u201d (1998, p.441).\n\nSidelle recommends, tentatively, that we describe the world without\nquantification over things, and deny that \u201cthere is genuine,\nworld-given individuation.\u201d Furthermore, as it is supposedly\nobvious that there is at least stuff, we should suppose so, and\ntheoretically regard the role of the \u2018world-stuff\u2019 as\n\u201cthe mind-independent matter of the world which, among other\nthings, determines our perceptions\u201d (1998, p.\u2009443).\n\nOne problem for this view is that it is virtually indistinguishable\nfrom a Quinean view according to which a physical object is just\n\u201cthe content, however heterogeneous, of some portion of\nspace-time, however disconnected and gerrymandered\u201d (Quine 1960,\np.\u2009171). Our sortals, according to a type of Quinean, are used\nto pick out definite filled portions, and any and all of these are\nobjects. What Sidelle calls \u2018stuff\u2019 Quine (or Jubien in\n1993) is happy to call an \u2018object\u2019. If Sidelle\u2019s\nstuff talk is inter-translatable into Quinean thing-talk then there is\nmerely a terminological difference between the posit of World-Stuff\nand the posit of arbitrary things.\n\nA further strange point about this view is that it entails that, just\nas there are no objects which have the persistence conditions that we\nthink, there are no non-fundamental stuffs. The very same arguments\ngiven for rejecting ordinary objects and reducing them to world stuff\ncan be given for water molecules and sodium chloride. Electrolysis can\nbe seen not as the destruction of water but as a change in persisting\nunderlying stuff. This can be carried on until we get to the\nfundamental stuff(s). Hydrogen can be seen as a phase of a proton and\nan electron, and a proton can be seen as a phase of quarks and gluons.\nSo, it seems that elements and complexes, since they are not the\nfundamental or non-individuated world-stuff, must also be the result\nof conceptual carvings.\n\nWhat about fundamental particles (assuming there are some)?\nThey\u2019ve got to go as well, if we assume they are objects. If\nthere are in fact gluons and electrons which exist, are objects, and\nare particular things with identity and persistence conditions, then,\nif they are in fact simple they form the basis out of which we could\nconstruct the other objects. So, if non-individual world stuff is\ngoing to play a role, it seems that we must eliminate fundamental\nparticles as well. This approach allows too much physics to be done\nfrom the armchair. (Other criticisms of views like Sidelle\u2019s can\nbe found in Denkel 1989, 1995; Laycock 1989; Steen 2011; Turner 2011;\nand meta-ontological criticisms of these kind of disagreements can be\nfound in Eklund 2008. And, while not directly addressed in the\nfollowing sources, a template for the criticism that these varying\nviews about stuff vs. things may be a \u2018disagreement without a\ndifference\u2019 can be found in Hirsch 2002 and Carnap 1950).\n\nIt must be noted, though, that such a World-Stuff view is similar to\nsome interpretations of elementary particle physics and quantum\ntheory. Some scientists and philosophers of science do in fact argue\nthat at bottom the world is not a world of things or objects (or not\nentities we would unqualifiedly apply \u2018object\u2019 to).\nRather, the basic stuff is non-particular\n mass-energy,\n or evolving local quantum states (Arntzenius 2012 \u00a73.14), or\nfields, wave-functions, or spacetime itself (Malament 1996, Wallace\nand Timpson 2007), or structures (Ladyman and Ross 2009), or a kind of\nphysics-friendly materia prima (Esfeld et al 2017).\nSome argue that the only real entity is the space-time fabric,\nordinary objects just being temporary warpings or disturbances in it.\nOn such views both ordinary macroscopic objects and putative\nfundamental particles are only epiphenomenal entities or temporary\nmanifestations in the electromagnetic or gravitational fields (or\nother entities), which are fundamentally non-individual\u2014some\nkind of world stuff or spacetime and its features (for details, see\nthe entry\n identity and individuality in quantum theory).\n So, one should not rule out such views tout court. But,\ngiven the flux and opacity of such views, the untestability of some of\nthe theories which underly some of these views (e.g. String Theory),\nand the lack of scientific consensus on these issues, one should not\nquickly and whole-heartedly embrace the notion of fundamental\nnon-particular stuff either. These views merit further examination,\nbut their adequate demonstration in part rests upon succesful\nadvancements in physics and, for a layperson, a clear understanding of\nthese interpretations, each of which may not come anytime soon.\n",
