    "main_text": "Decision || Infinitely many possible actions: Ever-better wine\n7.1 Infinitely many possible actions: Ever-better wine\n\nPollock (1983) offers the following puzzle. You have a bottle of\nEver-better wine, which keeps improving as it ages: the later you open\nit, the better it will be. When should you open it? There\u2019s a\ngood sense in which any time is too soon: opening it slightly later\nwould be better. But the worst option is never to open it, and to\navoid this it must be opened at some time. This decision problem has\nuncountably many possible actions, but we could easily make them\ndenumerable by adding that the bottle can only be opened at discrete\ntimes\u2014e.g. on the hour. You would gladly perform an action that\nhas maximal utility, but here there is no such action! This problem\ndisplays an intriguing feature that Bartha, Barker and H\u00e1jek\n(2013) call discontinuity at infinity: \u201can infinite\nsequence of choices, each apparently sanctioned by plausible\nprinciples, converges \u2026 to a \u2018limit choice\u2019 whose\nutility is distinct from, and typically much lower than, the limit\napproached by the utilities of the choices in the sequence\u201d\n(630). Their paper discusses other decision problems with this\nfeature. For more discussion of this kind of phenomenon, see Chow,\nRobbins, and Siegmund (1971) and Seidenfeld (1981).\n",
