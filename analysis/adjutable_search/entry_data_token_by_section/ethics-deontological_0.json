Deontology\u2019s Foil: Consequentialism\n\nBecause deontological theories are best understood in contrast to\nconsequentialist ones, a brief look at consequentialism and a survey\nof the problems with it that motivate its deontological opponents,\nprovides a helpful prelude to taking up deontological theories\nthemselves. Consequentialists hold that choices\u2014acts and/or\nintentions\u2014are to be morally assessed solely by the states of\naffairs they bring about. Consequentialists thus must specify\ninitially the states of affairs that are intrinsically\nvaluable\u2014often called, collectively, \u201cthe Good.\u201d\nThey then are in a position to assert that whatever choices increase\nthe Good, that is, bring about more of it, are the choices that it is\nmorally right to make and to execute. (The Good in that sense is said\nto be prior to \u201cthe Right.\u201d)\n\nConsequentialists can and do differ widely in terms of specifying the\nGood. Some consequentialists are monists about the Good. Utilitarians,\nfor example, identify the Good with pleasure, happiness, desire\nsatisfaction, or \u201cwelfare\u201d in some other sense. Other\nconsequentialists are pluralists regarding the Good. Some of such\npluralists believe that how the Good is distributed among persons (or\nall sentient beings) is itself partly constitutive of the Good,\nwhereas conventional utilitarians merely add or average each\nperson\u2019s share of the Good to achieve the Good\u2019s\nmaximization.\n\nMoreover, there are some consequentialists who hold that the doing or\nrefraining from doing, of certain kinds of acts are themselves\nintrinsically valuable states of affairs constitutive of the Good. An\nexample of this is the positing of rights not being violated, or\nduties being kept, as part of the Good to be maximized\u2014the\nso-called \u201cutilitarianism of rights\u201d (Nozick 1974).\n\nNone of these pluralist positions erase the difference between\nconsequentialism and deontology. For the essence of consequentialism\nis still present in such positions: an action would be right only\ninsofar as it maximizes these Good-making states of affairs being\ncaused to exist.\n\nHowever much consequentialists differ about what the Good consists in,\nthey all agree that the morally right choices are those that increase\n(either directly or indirectly) the Good. Moreover, consequentialists\ngenerally agree that the Good is \u201cagent-neutral\u201d (Parfit\n1984; Nagel 1986). That is, valuable states of affairs are states of\naffairs that all agents have reason to achieve without regard to\nwhether such states of affairs are achieved through the exercise of\none\u2019s own agency or not.\n\nConsequentialism is frequently criticized on a number of grounds. Two\nof these are particularly apt for revealing the temptations motivating\nthe alternative approach to deontic ethics that is deontology. The two\ncriticisms pertinent here are that consequentialism is, on the one\nhand, overly demanding, and, on the other hand, that it is not\ndemanding enough. The criticism regarding extreme demandingness runs\nlike this: for consequentialists, there is no realm of moral\npermissions, no realm of going beyond one\u2019s moral duty\n(supererogation), no realm of moral indifference. All acts are\nseemingly either required or forbidden. And there also seems to be no\nspace for the consequentialist in which to show partiality to one\u2019s\nown projects or to one\u2019s family, friends, and countrymen, leading some\ncritics of consequentialism to deem it a profoundly alienating and\nperhaps self-effacing moral theory (Williams 1973).\n\nOn the other hand, consequentialism is also criticized for what it\nseemingly permits. It seemingly demands (and thus, of course, permits)\nthat in certain circumstances innocents be killed, beaten, lied to, or\ndeprived of material goods to produce greater benefits for others.\nConsequences\u2014and only consequences\u2014can conceivably justify\nany kind of act, for it does not matter how harmful it is to\nsome so long as it is more beneficial to others.\n\nA well-worn example of this over-permissiveness of consequentialism is\nthat of a case standardly called, Transplant. A surgeon has five\npatients dying of organ failure and one healthy patient whose organs\ncan save the five. In the right circumstances, surgeon will be\npermitted (and indeed required) by consequentialism to kill the\nhealthy patient to obtain his organs, assuming there are no relevant\nconsequences other than the saving of the five and the death of the\none. Likewise, consequentialism will permit (in a case that we shall\ncall, Fat Man) that a fat man be pushed in front of a runaway trolley\nif his being crushed by the trolley will halt its advance towards five\nworkers trapped on the track. We shall return to these examples later\non.\n\nConsequentialists are of course not bereft of replies to these two\ncriticisms. Some retreat from maximizing the Good to\n\u201csatisficing\u201d\u2014that is, making the achievement of\nonly a certain level of the Good mandatory (Slote 1984). This move\nopens up some space for personal projects and relationships, as well\nas a realm of the morally permissible. It is not clear, however, that\nsatisficing is adequately motivated, except to avoid the problems of\nmaximizing. Nor is it clear that the level of mandatory satisficing\ncan be nonarbitrarily specified, or that satisficing will not require\ndeontological constraints to protect satisficers from maximizers.\n\nAnother move is to introduce a positive/negative duty distinction\nwithin consequentialism. On this view, our (negative) duty is not to\nmake the world worse by actions having bad consequences; lacking is a\ncorresponding (positive) duty to make the world better by actions\nhaving good consequences (Bentham 1789 (1948); Quinton 2007). We thus\nhave a consequentialist duty not to kill the one in Transplant or in\nFat Man; and there is no counterbalancing duty to save five that\noverrides this. Yet as with the satisficing move, it is unclear how a\nconsistent consequentialist can motivate this restriction on all-out\noptimization of the Good.\n\nYet another idea popular with consequentialists is to move from\nconsequentialism as a theory that directly assesses acts to\nconsequentialism as a theory that directly assesses\nrules\u2014or character-trait inculcation\u2014and assesses\nacts only indirectly by reference to such rules (or character-traits)\n(Alexander 1985). Its proponents contend that indirect\nconsequentialism can avoid the criticisms of direct (act)\nconsequentialism because it will not legitimate egregious violations\nof ordinary moral standards\u2014e.g., the killing of the innocent to\nbring about some better state of affairs\u2014nor will it be overly\ndemanding and thus alienating each of us from our own projects.\n\nThe relevance here of these defensive maneuvers by consequentialists\nis their common attempt to mimic the intuitively plausible aspects of\na non-consequentialist, deontological approach to ethics. For as we\nshall now explore, the strengths of deontological approaches lie: (1)\nin their categorical prohibition of actions like the killing of\ninnocents, even when good consequences are in the offing; and (2) in\ntheir permission to each of us to pursue our own projects free of any\nconstant demand that we shape those projects so as to make everyone\nelse well off.\n",
