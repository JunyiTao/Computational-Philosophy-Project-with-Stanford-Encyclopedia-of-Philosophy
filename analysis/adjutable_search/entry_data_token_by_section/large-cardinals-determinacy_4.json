    "main_text": "Philosophical Motivation || The Nature of Axioms\n1.4  The Nature of Axioms\n\nThe above characterization of the question of pluralism makes it\nclear that it is closely connected with issues concerning the nature\nof justification in mathematics. The most traditional form of\njustification in mathematics involves justifying a statement by\nproving it from the axioms. This then raises the question: What is the\nsource of the justification of the axioms? \n\n The radical pluralist maintains that there is nothing that\njustifies the axioms; rather they are simply postulates that one\nadopts hypothetically for a given purpose. This view faces the\ndifficulty raised above. Most would maintain that axioms have a\nprivileged status and that this status is more than merely\nhypothetical. \n1.4.1  The Evidentness Order\n\nA popular view is that axioms are self-evident truths\nconcerning their domain. The difficulty with this view is that there\nis wide disagreement in the foundations of mathematics as to which\nstatements are self-evident and if we restrict ourselves to the\nintersection of the statements that all mathematicians would\nregard as self-evident then the result will be quite limited in reach,\nperhaps coinciding with Q or slightly\n more.[4] \n Markov\nhad a similar complaint with the employment of the related notion of\nbeing \u201cintuitively clear\u201d: \n \nI can in no way agree to taking \u2018intuitively\nclear\u2019 as a criterion of truth in mathematics, for this\ncriterion would mean the complete triumph of subjectivism and would\nlead to a break with the understanding of science as a form of social\nactivity. (Markov (1962))\n\nFor these reasons we will not employ the notion of self-evidence. \n\n There is, however, a related notion that we shall employ, namely,\nthe notion of one statement being more evident than\nanother. In contrast to the case of self-evidence, there is generally\nwide agreement (in the cases that concern us) on the question of what\nis more evident than what. \n To illustrate this it is best to give some examples. Consider the following equivalences: \n\nOver the base theory EFA (Exponential Function Arithmetic), the Finite Ramsey Theorem is equivalent to the totality of superexponentiation (see Friedman (2011), \n \u00a70.5).[5] \nOver the base theory RCA0 (Recursive Comprehension Axiom), the Hilbert Basis Theorem is equivalent to the statement that \u03c9\u03c9 is well-ordered (see Friedman (2011), \u00a70.6D). \nOver the base theory ACA\u2032 (Arithemetical Comprehension Axiom (with finite Turing Jumps for all reals)), Goodstein's Theorem and the Hydra Theorem are each equivalent to the \u03a301-soundness of PA (see Friedman (2011), \u00a7\u00a70.8B, 0.8E). \nOver the base theory RCA0, Kruskal's Tree Theorem is equivalent to the statement that \u03b8\u03a9\u03c9 is well-ordered (see Friedman (2011), \u00a70.9B). \nOver the base theory ACA\u2032, the Exotic Case (of Boolean Relation Theory) is equivalent to the \u03a301-soundness of SMAH (ZFC with strongly n-Mahlo cardinals) (see Friedman (2011), \u00a70.14C). \n\n\n In each of the above cases, the second statement is more evident\nthan the first and there is general agreement on this fact. For\nexample, the Hilbert Basis Theorem is far from immediate. It is the\nsort of thing that we set out to prove from things that are more\nevident. In contrast, the statement that \u03c9\u03c9 is\nwell-founded is something that becomes clear by reflecting on the\nconcepts involved. It is not the sort of thing that we set out to\nprove from something more evident. This is what lies behind the fact\nthat the Hilbert Basis Theorem is called a theorem and not an\naxiom. As one climbs up through the other examples, the asymmetry\nbecomes even more dramatic. For example, the Hydra Theorem and\nKruskal's Theorem are actually quite surprising and\ncounter-intuitive. These are definitely the sort of statements that\nrequire proof on the basis of statements that are more evident. \n\n We shall organize the statements in each interpretability degree\nby the relation of being more evident than and we shall speak of the\ncollection of all statements so ordered as the evidentness\norder. \n\n A few words of caution are necessary concerning this\nordering. First, in saying that X is more evident than Y\nwe do not intend that X (or Y) is self-evident. To\nunderscore this point we will often use the expressions\n\u201cX is prior to Y in the evidentness\norder\u201d. Second, even in the case where X is minimal in\nthe evidentness order (within a given interpretability degree) we\nrefrain from saying that X is self-evident; indeed if the\ndegree is sufficiently high then this will not be the case. Third, the\nevidentness order is to be understood as an epistemic order and not,\nsay, the order of conceptual complexity. Fourth, we are not saying\nthat every two statements X and Y are comparable in the\nevidentness order. Indeed there are cases where there is not wide\nagreement on how to compare two statements in this order. However, we\nshall only employ the notion where there is wide\nagreement. \n\n In addition, one might raise skeptical worries about the\nevidentness order. For example, perhaps judgments of the form\n\u201cX is prior to Y in the evidentness order\u201d\nare really just reflections of our mathematical training. The best way\nto allay such concerns and test the robustness of the notion is to\nexamine examples. Compare, for example, the statement of the Hydra\nTheorem and the statement that \u03f50 is well-ordered\nwith respect to primitive recursive relations (a weak\n(semi-constructive) form of the statement that \u03f50 is\nwell-ordered). If you describe the relevant notions to a mathematician\nor layperson who is not familiar with them then you will find the\nfollowing: There will be no expectation that Hercules wins the\nHydra. In fact, if you direct the person to one of the computer\nprograms (available online) that simulates the Hydra you will find\nthat they will be astounded at how fast the Hydra grows and if you\nassure them that if they kept on playing\u2014for a period of more\nyears than there are atoms in the physical universe (as currently\nestimated)\u2014the tides will eventually turn, they will make gains\nand eventually cut the Hydra down to size, you will find that they\nwill look at you in amazement. This is something that needs proof. Now\nif you describe to them the ordinals all the way up to\n\u03f50 and you describe the notion of a well-ordering and\nask them whether \u03f50 is well-founded you will find\nthat the answer rests solely on whether they have grasped the object\nin question. To come to the conclusion that \u03f50 is\nwell-founded one does not search for a proof from some other statement\nwhich is more evident. Rather one works directly with the concepts\ninvolved. The statement, as it were, rests on the legitimacy of the\nunderlying concepts and one comes to accept it by grasping those\nconcepts. It is here that the buck stops in the process of seeking\njustification. And this is what we mean in saying that the statement\n\u201c\u03f50 is well-ordered\u201d is minimal in the\nevidentness order (of the degree of the Hydra Theorem). \n\n In seeking axioms for theories within a given interpretability\n degree[6] \n we seek\naxioms that are as low as possible in the evidentness\norder. Ultimately one would like to find axioms that\nare minimal in the evidentness order. But questions remain:\n(1) Can we be assured of finding minimal points that\nare secure? The concern is that as one climbs up the\ninterpretability degrees the security of the minimal points will\nweaken to the point where there would arguably be little security\nleft. To see this consider statements of the form \u201c\u03b1 is\nwell-ordered\u201d where \u03b1 is the proof-theoretic ordinal of\nthe interpretability degree. As one climbs the degrees one passes\nthrough \u03f50, \u03930, and\n\u03b8\u03a9\u03c9. This barely scratches the surface\nand yet already the corresponding statements of wellfoundedness have\nbecome less evident. This leads to the second question. (2) Is finding\na minimal point in the evidentness order (of a given interpretability\ndegree) the most one could hope for or are there other, more subtle\nways of accumulating evidence for axioms, ways that might further\nbuttress even the minimal points in the evidentness order (of a given\ninterpretability degree)? \n1.4.2  Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Justifications\n\nThere is a discussion of G\u00f6del that has bearing on each of\nthese questions, namely, his discussion of intrinsic and extrinsic\njustifications in his classic paper (G\u00f6del (1947), expanded as\nG\u00f6del (1964)). \n\n In introducing the notion of an intrinsic justification\nG\u00f6del gives as an example certain large cardinal axioms that are\njust beyond the reach of ZFC: \n \n[The] axioms of set theory [ZFC] by no means form a\nsystem closed in itself, but, quite on the contrary, the very concept\nof set on which they are based suggests their extension by new axioms\nwhich assert the existence of still further iterations of the\noperation \u201cset of\u201d (260).\n\n\nAs examples he mentions the axioms asserting the existence of\ninaccessible cardinals and Mahlo cardinals: \n \nThese axioms show clearly, not only that the axiomatic\nsystem of set theory as used today is incomplete, but also that it can\nbe supplemented without arbitrariness by new axioms which\nonly unfold the content of the concept of set as explained\nabove. (260\u2013261, my emphasis)\n\n\nSince G\u00f6del later refers to such axioms as having\n\u201cintrinsic necessity\u201d we shall accordingly speak of such\naxioms being intrinsically justified on the basis of the iterative\nconcept of set. \n\n The notion of extrinsic justification is introduced as\nfollows: \n \n[E]ven disregarding the intrinsic necessity of some\nnew axiom, and even in case it has no intrinsic necessity at all, a\nprobable decision about its truth is possible also in another way,\nnamely, inductively by studying its \u201csuccess\u201d. (261)\n\n\nHere by \u201csuccess\u201d G\u00f6del means \u201cfruitfulness\nin consequences, in particular \u201cverifiable\u201d\nconsequences\u201d. In a famous passage he writes: \n \nThere might exist axioms so abundant in their\nverifiable consequences, shedding so much light upon a whole field,\nand yielding such powerful methods for solving problems (and even\nsolving them constructively, as far as that is possible) that, no\nmatter whether or not they are intrinsically necessary, they would\nhave to be accepted at least in the same sense as any well-established\nphysical theory. (261)\n\n\n Let us now consider some examples. Consider first the conception\nof natural number that underlies the theory of Peano Arithmetic\n(PA). This conception of natural number not only justifies\nmathematical induction for the language of PA but also for any\nmathematical extension of the language of PA that is\n meaningful.[7] \n For\nexample, if we extend the language of PA by adding the Tarski truth\npredicate and we extend the axioms of PA by adding the Tarski truth\naxioms, then, on the basis of the conception of natural number, we are\njustified in accepting instances of mathematical induction involving\nthe truth predicate. In the resulting theory, one can prove\nCon(PA). This process can then be iterated (for more on this subject\nsee Feferman (1991) and the references therein) In contrast,\nthe \u03a001-statement\nCon(ZFC + \u201cThere are \u03c9-many Woodin cardinals\u201d) (a\nstatement to which we shall return below) is undoubtedly not\nintrinsically justified on the basis of the conception of natural\nnumber; rather its justification flows from an intricate network of\ntheorems in contemporary set theory, as we shall argue below. \n\n Consider next the iterative conception of set. As in the case of\narithmetic, this conception (arguably) intrinsically justifies\ninstances of Replacement and Comprehension for certain extensions of\nthe language of set theory. But there are richer principles that are\n(arguably) intrinsically justified on the basis of this conception,\nnamely, the set-theoretic reflection principles. These principles\nassert (roughly) that any property that holds of V holds of\nsome initial segment V\u03b1. These principles\nyield inaccessible and Mahlo cardinals (and more) and quite likely\nunderlie G\u00f6del's claims in the above passage. Some have argued\nthat such reflection principles are intrinsically justified on the\nbasis of the iterative conception of set and, moreover, that they\nexhaust the principles that can be intrinsically justified on that\nconception (see, for example, Tait (2001), reprinted in (2005b),\npp. 283\u2013284). \n\n There is a view according to which intrinsically justified axioms\nare minimal points in the evidentness order and, moreover, that that\nis the most that one can hope for. On such a view, if one grants that\nthe above principles of set theory are intrinsically justified on the\nbasis of the iterative conception of set, then although one would have\naxioms that far surpassed the reaches of predicativism and even ZFC,\nlimitations would still remain and presumably a proponent of such a\nview would embrace pluralism for the remainder. For example, if, as\nTait (2001) argues, intrinsic justifications are confined to the\nhierarchy of reflection principles investigated in Tait (2005a), then\nby the results of Koellner (2009a), such a view would have to embrace\npluralism with regard to PU. \n\n Extrinsic justifications provide us with the hope of securing\naxioms that have much greater reach. For they provide us with an\nadditional way to secure axioms, one that proves to be very rich. On\nthis view one can hope for much more than a minimal point in the\nevidentness order\u2014one can hope to garner evidence for a\nproposition examining its inter-relationships with other statements\nthat are low in the evidentness ordering. Let us describe in very\nbroad brush strokes how this might work. To begin with, let us say\nthat a statement is \u201cintrinsically plausible\u201d if it is\n\u201clow\u201d in the evidentness order but the sort of thing that\ncould be overturned by other \n evidence.[8] \n One way to garner support for a proposition\nis to show that it leads to intrinsically plausible consequences. If\none then shows that it is the only statement that has these\nintrinsically plausible consequences then that strengthens the case by\nruling out possible incompatible competitors. If one shows that there\nare other intrinsically plausible statements that actually imply the\naxiom in question then that again strengthens the case by mapping over\nthe degree of intrinsic plausibility attached to one statement over to\nanother. \n\n On this picture the general structure of the case for new axioms\nis this: First, for each interpretability degree one isolates the\nminimal points in the evidentness order and one organizes the entire\ndegree under the degree of one statement being more evident than\nanother. As one climbs the interpretability degrees the minimal points\ngenerally become less evident and so one seeks additional\nsupport. Second, one then examines the interconnections among the\nstatements in the interpretability degree, in particular, among the\nstatements which are low in the evidentness order. The hope is that a\nseries of deep mathematical theorems will reveal structural\nconnections that provides more and more evidential support for the\nstatements. Should this be the case then the loss in evidence attached\nto the minimal points as one climbs the interpretability hierarchy\nwould be compensated for by the gain in structural connections that\nare revealed as one ascends to richer domains of mathematics. \n\n All of this is rather abstract at this stage. It is now time to\nturn to a concrete mathematical case where such structural connections\nhave been found. The question, of course, will be whether the\nmathematics makes for a convincing extrinsic case for new axioms. And\nthe question of pluralism at this level\u2014where we are\npresupposing ZFC and trying to solve the problem of selection for\nsecond-order arithmetic\u2014will rest on the nature of the\ncase. \n\nFurther Reading: For further discussion of the nature of\naxioms and justification in mathematics see Parsons (2008) and Maddy\n(2011). \n",
