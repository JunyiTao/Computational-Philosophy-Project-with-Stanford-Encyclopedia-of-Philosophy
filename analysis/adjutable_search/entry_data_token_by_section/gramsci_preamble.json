    "main_text": "\n\nAntonio Gramsci (1891\u20131937) has been enormously influential as a\nMarxist theorist of cultural and political domination in\n\u201cdeveloped\u201d capitalism. However, his career was that of a\nradical journalist and revolutionary organizer, not a professional\nphilosopher. Gramsci was a socialist activist, cultural commentator\nand, later, communist party leader in Italy. Most of his writings are\nconcerned with assessing the immediate political situation and,\nparticularly, the prospects for revolution in interwar Italy.\nNonetheless, Gramsci was conversant with philosophical currents of the\ntime\u2014especially Italian neo-idealism, native intellectual and\npolitical traditions dating back to Machiavelli, and the major\ncurrents of Marxist thought. It was only with his imprisonment by the\nFascist authorities that he produced his most well-known and\nphilosophically rich texts: the Prison Notebooks. The\ninsights therein account for much of his posthumous recognition.\n\nIn the Notebooks, Gramsci undertook a series of historical\nand theoretical reflections on the conditions for revolution in modern\nstates\u2014such as Italy\u2019s\u2014where degrees of popular\nconsent had been achieved. He employed the concept\n\u201chegemony\u201d to describe a process of \u201cintellectual\nand moral leadership\u201d that embedded a ruling class across\nsociety. He rejected the economic determinism of classical Marxism in\nfavor of a nuanced political analysis attuned to contingent variation\nin historical circumstance. Gramsci brought Marxism into dialogue with\nneo-idealist insights into practical subjectivity and he sketched a\nrevolutionary strategy aimed at preparing a new collective identity.\nAlthough fragmentary and open to contrasting emphases, the\nNotebooks set out a radical philosophy of politics that has\nbeen of enduring value to critical political and cultural theory.\n",
