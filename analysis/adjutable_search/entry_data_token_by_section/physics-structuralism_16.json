    "main_text": "Three structuralist programs || Interactions between the three structuralist programs\n5.4 Interactions between the three structuralist programs\n\nAs already noted, the programs of Ludwig and Sneed have been\nindependently developed in the 1970s, whereas Scheibe\u2019s program,\nat least partially, originated from a critical review of these two\nprograms. But this is only a coarse description. Additionally, there\nhave been numerous mutual interactions between the three programs that\ninfluenced their later elaborations. Evidence for this interaction is\nprovided, besides various pertinent acknowledgements in books and\narticles, by the following observations.\n\nBalzer, Moulines and Sneed in their (1987) introduce the concepts\nof \u201cspecies of structures\u201d and \u201cuniform\nstructures\u201d that play a central r\u00f4le in Ludwig (1970,\n1978) and are not yet contained in Sneed (1971).\nVice versa, Ludwig in his (1990) added a section 9.3 on theory\nnets (Theorienetze) citing respective works of Balzer and\nMoulines.\nIn his late (2006) Ludwig on p.3 refers to the work of Scheibe\n\u201cbecause of the many similarities\u201d. Later on p.107 he\nmentions a \u201cdiscussion through letters\u201d with Scheibe. This\ncorrespondence has been secured by B. Falkenburg and is waiting for a\nscientific edition.\n\n",
