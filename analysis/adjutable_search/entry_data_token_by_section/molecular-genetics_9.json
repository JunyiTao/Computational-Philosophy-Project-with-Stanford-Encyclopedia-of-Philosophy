    "main_text": "What is a gene?\n4. What is a gene?\n\n\nA common claim in the philosophical literature about molecular\ngenetics is that genes cannot be conceived at the molecular level. Of\ncourse, philosophers do not deny that biologists use the term\ngene, but many philosophers believe gene is a dummy\nterm, a placeholder for many different concepts. Different responses\nto gene skepticism illustrate a variety of philosophical aims and\napproaches. One kind of response is to analyze explanations closely\ntied to experimental practice (rather than sweeping generalizations of\na fundamental theory) in order to determine whether there are uniform\npatterns of reasoning about genes that could (a) be codified into\nclear concepts, and/or (b) used to establish the reference of the\nterm. Another kind of response is to propose new gene concepts that\nwill better serve the expressed aims of practicing biologists. A third\nkind of response is to implement survey analysis, rather than conduct\ntraditional methods of philosophical analysis. A fourth kind of\nresponse is to embrace the (allegedly) necessary vagueness of the gene\nconcept(s) and to examine why use of the term gene is so\nuseful.\n",
