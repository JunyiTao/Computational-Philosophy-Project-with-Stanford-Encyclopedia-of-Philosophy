    "main_text": "The Cosmogonic Turn || Polarity and Cycles\n3.4 Polarity and Cycles\n\nAll of the cosmogonies posit stages between the ultimate and the\nconcrete myriad things of the world. If the ultimate ground of things\nis immanent rather than teleological, then concrete things must be\nexplained through a gradual process of spontaneous differentiation.\nHaving a series of stages also allows for degrees of differentiation\nwithin a connected whole. That provides an explanation not just for\nthings, but also for nature as a system.\n\nThe most common stage involves interaction between two forces. These\npolar forces could be specified in many ways\u2014heaven and earth,\nhot and cold, dry and moist\u2014but the pair that came to dominate\nis yin \u9670 and yang\u967d. (For a thorough\nstudy of yin and yang, see R. Wang 2012.)\nYang originally referred to the south side of a mountain,\nwhich received the sun, while yin referred to the north side.\nUltimately, yang was associated with the masculine, the\nforceful, and the bright, while yin was associated with the\nfeminine, the yielding, and the obscure. Creativity followed from the\ninteraction of yin and yang, analogous to sexual\nreproduction.\n\nAll of the cosmogonies include cycles and processes of return. One\nprominent model was the four seasons. The change of seasons places\ncycles of growth and decay into a broader context of continuous\nvitality. The change of seasons itself, though, was seen as expressing\na more fundamental cycle between poles such as yin and\nyang. Cyclical change could also be theorized through the\nprogressions of generation (sheng \u751f) or overcoming\n(ke \u514b) among the five phases (wuxing\n\u4e94\u884c): wood, earth, fire, water, and metal. Another\nversion of this cycling between poles was the claim that when\nprocesses reach an extreme, they reverse. Yet another manifestation is\nthat things emerge from a common source and ultimately return to that\nsource. In all of these cases, cyclicality explains the sustainability\nand predictability of natural patterns.\n",
