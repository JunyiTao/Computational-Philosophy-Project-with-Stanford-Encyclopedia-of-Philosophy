    "main_text": "Spirituality and Theological Works\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe publication of the 27-volume Edith Stein Gesamtausgabe\nhas confirmed Stein as an independent, creative, and highly productive\nphilosopher, who made original contributions on such diverse topics as\npersonhood and the apprehension of others in empathy, collective\nintentionality and shared experiences, emotions and values, the nature\nof the state, the education of women and women\u2019s rights and the\nnature of being and essence. Stein was not only in critical discussion\nwith her contemporaries, including philosophers such as Pf\u00e4nder,\nScheler, Reinach, or Husserl, psychologists such as Lipps,\nM\u00fcnsterberg, or Stumpf, and sociologists such as T\u00f6nnies,\nLitt, or Simmel, but her work also harbors rich conceptual,\nmethodological and systematic resources that are of continued\nrelevance for a number of recent philosophical and interdisciplinary\ndebates. While in her earlier writings Stein pursued detailed\nphenomenological analyses, in her later work she engaged in\nmetaphysics, but also in philosophical and theological anthropology\nand mysticism. Integrating eidetic phenomenology and Thomistic\nmetaphysics, Stein ultimately developed a novel systematic account of\nsocial life that is the produce of the actions of free, individual\npersons, whose experiences and volitions are rooted in cognitions as\nwell as emotions and who can attain the level of rational and communal\nlife that is open to the possibility of a transcendence, lifting\nhumans beyond their finitude.\n",
