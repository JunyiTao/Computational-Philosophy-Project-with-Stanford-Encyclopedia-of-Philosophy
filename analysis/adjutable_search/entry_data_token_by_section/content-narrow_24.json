A\nnumber of responses have been attempted (many of them already\nanticipated in YVH 2018).\n\nFirst, some critics focus on the Mirror Man example. One approach is\nto suggest that mirrored duplicates are not in fact qualitatively\nidentical (Chalmers 2018, Jerzak 2021). Another is to suggest that the\ntwo hemispheres of Mirror Man\u2019s brain are in effect two separate\nagents, so that the agent parameter is enough to give the two thoughts\ndifferent truth values (Hattiangadi 2019). One problem with this kind\nof response is that YVH have alternative examples that pose similar\nproblems but cannot be rejected in these ways (YVH 2018, pp.\n78\u201379, 93\u201394).\n\nSecond, one can question the idea that a content assignment should\nassign contents to individual thoughts. An alternative approach is to\nassign contents not to individual thoughts, but to an agent. YVH call\nthis a \u201ccoarse\u201d content assignment, and argue that such an\nassignment cannot serve the explanatory purposes of narrow content\nadvocates. Jerzak (2021) notes that assigning contents to thoughts\nassumes that thoughts are atomistic, and argues that on a more\nholistic view like that of Stalnaker (1990), coarse content\nassignments would be more appropriate. Byrne (2021) also defends\ncoarse content assignments, and criticizes YVH\u2019s objections to\nthem (though Byrne thinks that coarse assignments will only make\nthings worse for the defender of narrow content). In their reply to\nByrne (YVH 2021a), YVH concede that some of their criticisms of coarse\nassignments are not decisive, and go on to make some interesting\nsuggestions about how a narrow content advocate might try to construct\na suitable notion of narrow content for coarse content assignments.\nThey show that on one way of doing so, \u201cMirror Man would not\npose a threat\u201d (YVH 2021a, p. 3051). (Of course, they think that\nother threats remain.)\n\nThird, one can question YVH\u2019s definition of narrow content in a\ndifferent way. For YVH, a narrow content assignment must supervene on\nthe total qualitative state of an agent. As Chalmers points out, one\ncan be an internalist about mental content without requiring a content\nassignment to be this restrictive. Instead of requiring that content\nsupervene on the agent\u2019s qualitative properties, one could\nsimply require that it supervene on internal properties, where these\nmight include the agent\u2019s identity and the identities of\nparticular thoughts or experiences. As Chalmers puts it, the resulting\nview of content, although it would not have the consequence that exact\nduplicates must share all their mental contents, might still be\n\u201cinternalist enough to be interesting\u201d (Chalmers 2018).\nYVH call such views \u201cquasi-internalist,\u201d and this notion\nof content \u201cquasi-narrow\u201d (YVH 2018, Chapter 5).\n\nFourth, one might bite the bullet and embrace one of the two radical\nforms of relativism discussed by YVH. The simpler one is to add\nthoughts as parameters, resulting in the view that YVH call\n\u201cthought-relativism\u201d (pp. 80\u201381). (The other one is\n\u201cextension-assignment relativism.\u201d) YVH give detailed\narguments against such views, but Chalmers suggests that they might\nstill have promise (Chalmers 2018). As Chalmers notes, it seems that\nwe can have thoughts like \u201cthe thinker of this very thought is\nhuman,\u201d where the truth or falsity of the thought depends on the\nidentity of the thought token being evaluated. Speaks (2021) explores\nsome ways of developing thought-relativism, but argues that the view,\nif developed in such a way that it gives the right results about a\npriori knowledge, will \u201ccollapse into quasi-internalism\u201d\n(Speaks 2021, p. 3044).\n",
