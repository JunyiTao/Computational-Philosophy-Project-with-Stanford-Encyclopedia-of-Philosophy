(For a\nfuller discussion, see Lycan (2001).)\n\nIntrospection. Block\u2019s Earthling suddenly transported\nto Inverted Earth or some other relevant sort of Twin Earth would\nnotice nothing introspectively, despite a change in representational\ncontent; so the sensory quality must remain unchanged and so is\nnarrow.\n\nReply: The same goes for propositional attitudes, i.e., the\ntransported Earthling would notice nothing introspectively. Yet the\nattitude contents are still wide. Wideness does not entail\nintrospective change under transportation.\n\nNarrow content. In the propositional-attitude literature, the\ncorresponding transportation argument has been taken as the basis of\nan argument for \u201cnarrow content,\u201d viz., for something that\nis intentional content within the meaning of the act but is narrow\nrather than, as usual, wide. The self-knowledge problem\naforementioned, and the problem of \u201cwide causation\u201d (Fodor\n(1987), Kim (1995)), have also been used to motivate narrow content.\nAnd, indeed, any general argument for narrow content will presumably\napply to sensory representation as well as to propositional attitudes.\nIf there is narrow content at all, and sensory content is\nrepresentational, then probably sensory states have narrow content\ntoo. Thus, sensory qualities can and should be taken to be the narrow\ncontents of such states.\n\nReplies: First, this begs the question against the claim that the\nqualities are wide. Even if there are indeed narrow contents impacted\nwithin sensory states, independent argument is needed for the\nidentification of sensory qualities with those contents rather than\nwith wide contents. Second and more strongly, narrow sensory contents\nstill would not correspond to sensory qualities in our sense. So far\nas has been shown, the redness of a patch in my visual field is still\na wide property, even if some other, narrow property underlies it in\nthe same way that (mysterious, ineffable) narrow contents are supposed\nto underlie beliefs and desires.\n\nModelling a shift of qualities. If perceptual contents are\nwide and the environment is subject to change, we should expect a\nshift, even if the perceptual contents would not shift as readily as\nattitude contents would. Perhaps they would eventually shift after\nseveral centuries on Inverted Earth, if a subject could stay alive\nthat long. But how would a distinctive quality even imaginably undergo\nsuch a shift? For example, suppose that a quality is supposed to shift\nfrom blue to yellow. A shift from blue to yellow might reasonably be\nsupposed to be a smooth and gradual shift along the spectrum that\npasses through green. But it is hardly plausible that one would\nexperience such a shift, or a period of unmistakable greenness in\nparticular.\n\nReply: We have no plausible model for a shift of everyday attitude\ncontent either. How would a type of belief state smoothly go from\nbeing about blue to being about yellow? Presumably not by being about\ngreen in between. So our presumed quality shift is no worse off than\nthe attitudinal shift in this regard; if the present argument works\nfor the former case, it also works for the latter, contrary to\nhypothesis.\n\nTo this it may be rejoined that attitude contents are more tractable,\nin that they may yield to some view of aboutness according to which\nreference can divide for a time between contents such as blue\nand yellow. (E.g., Field\u2019s (1973) theory of \u201cpartial\nreference.\u201d) It is harder to imagine \u201cdivided\u201d\nphenomenology.\n\nModes of presentation (Rey (1998); Chalmers (2004) defends a\nsimilar view). There is no such thing as representation without a mode\nof presentation. If a sensory quality is a representatum, then it is\nrepresented under a mode of presentation, and modes of presentation\nmay be narrow even when the representational content itself is wide.\nIndeed, many philosophers of mind take modes of presentation to be\ninternal causal or functional roles played by the representations in\nquestion. Surely they are strong candidates for qualitative content.\nAre they not narrow qualitative features?\n\nReply: Remember, the sensory qualities themselves are properties like\nsubjective greenness and redness, which according to the\nrepresentational theory are representata. The modes or guises\nunder which greenness and redness are represented in vision\nare something else again.\n\nBut it can plausibly be argued that such modes and guises are\nqualitative or phenomenal properties of some sort, perhaps\nhigher-order properties. See the next section.\n\nMemory (Block (1996)). \u201c[Y]ou remember the color of the\nsky on your birthday last year, the year before that, ten years before\nthat, and so on, and your long-term memory gives you good reason to\nthink that the phenomenal character of the experience has not\nchanged\u2026. Of course, memory can go wrong, but why\nshould we suppose that it must go wrong here?\u201d\n(pp. 43\u201344, italics and boldface original). The idea is that\nmemory acts as a check on the sensory qualities, and can be used to\nsupport the claim that the qualities have remained unchanged despite\nthe wholesale shift in representational contents.\n\nReply: Memory contents are wide, and so by Block\u2019s own reasoning\nthey will themselves undergo the representational shift to the\nInverted-Earth complementary color. Thus, your post-shift memories of\ngood old Earth are false. When you say or think to yourself,\n\u201cYes, the sky looks as blue as it did thirty years ago,\u201d\nyou are not expressing the same memory content as you would have when\nyou had just arrived on Inverted Earth. You are now remembering or\nseeming to remember that the sky looked yellow, since for you\n\u201cblue\u201d now means yellow. And that memory is false, since\non the long-ago occasion the sky looked blue to you, not yellow;\nmemory is not after all a reliable check on the sensory qualities.\n(Lycan (1996) takes this line; Tye (1998) expands it in more\ndetail.)\n\nStructural mismatch. Following Hardin (1988) and others,\nPautz (2014, 2019) argues that the structural properties of a sensory\nfield, paradigmatically resemblance relations, match the neural\nsubstrates of the relevant experiences rather than the chemical or\nphysical properties of the representata. For example, the sensory\nquality blue resembles purple more strongly than it resembles green,\nbut the reflectances underlying worldly objects are the other way\naround: the blue reflectance type resembles the green reflectance type\nmore than it does the purple. Even more dramatic mismatches obtain in\nthe case of smell. Therefore, it seems that a sensory quality is a\nnarrow property rather than the wide worldly one predicted by standard\nexternalist psychosemantics.\n\nReply: First, that a sense modality represents two worldly properties\nas being similar to degree n does not entail that they are\nthus similar; there may be illusion regarding resemblance. Second,\nthere will be room for debate regarding exactly what chemical or\nphysical properties do constitute the representata, and regarding what\npsychosemantics connects those properties to the sensory\nexperience.\n\nHardly anyone will accept all of the foregoing replies. But no one\nshould now find it uncontestable either that sensory qualities are\nnarrow or that they are wide. The matter is likely to remain\ncontroversial for some time to come.\n",
