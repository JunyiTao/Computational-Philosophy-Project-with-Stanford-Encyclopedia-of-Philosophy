    "main_text": "\n\n\nOn the strength of her 1666 pamphlet, Womens Speaking\nJustified, the Quaker writer Margaret Fell has been hailed as a\nfeminist pioneer. In this short tract, Fell puts forward several\narguments in favour of women\u2019s preaching. She asserts the\nspiritual equality of the sexes, she appeals to female exempla in the\nBible, and she reinterprets key scriptural passages that appear to\nendorse women\u2019s subordination to men. Some scholars, however,\nhave questioned Fell\u2019s status as a feminist thinker. They point\nto the fact that, according to Fell and her fellow Quakers, women are\npermitted to speak in church\u2014but only in so far as they are\nvessels or mouthpieces for Christ. In every other respect, it is\nargued, the early Quakers continue to either ignore, denigrate, or\nefface the female sex. Other critics point out that the Quakers\u2019\ngender egalitarian principles operate in a rather limited sphere of\nactivity\u2014that of religious worship alone\u2014and do not extend\nto the socio-political domain. Notwithstanding such criticisms,\nFell\u2019s defence of women\u2019s preaching was undoubtedly\ninfluential in her time and may have inspired women writers beyond her\nreligious circle. Foxton (1994) claims that Quaker women\u2019s\nwritings more generally set an important precedent for women\u2019s\npublishing activities in the seventeenth century, on both religious and\nnon-religious topics. Recent scholars also point to evidence that Fell\u2019s works on Judaism may have influenced Spinoza (cf. Fell 1987; Clausen-Brown 2019).\n",
