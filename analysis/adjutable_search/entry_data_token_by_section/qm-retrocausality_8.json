The\northodox reading of the no-go theorems is that, whatever is said about\nthe ultimate conceptual and ontological framework for understanding\nquantum theory, it cannot be completely classical: it must be nonlocal\nand/or contextual and/or ascribe reality to indeterminate states. In\nshort, quantum theory cannot be about local hidden variables. Part of\nthe appeal of hypothesizing retrocausality in the face of these no-go\ntheorems is to regain (either partial or complete) classicality in\nthese senses (albeit, with\u2014perhaps nonclassical\u2014symmetric\ncausal influences). That is, retrocausality holds the potential to\nallow a metaphysical framework for quantum mechanics that contains\ncausally action-by-contact, noncontextual (or where any contextuality\nis underpinned by noncontextual epistemic constraints),\ncounterfactually definite, determinate (although possibly\nindeterministic), spatiotemporally located properties for physical\nsystems\u2014in other words, a classical ontology.\n\nA nice to way to consider this is in terms of Quine\u2019s (1951)\ndistinction between the \u201contology\u201d and the\n\u201cideology\u201d of a scientific theory, where the ideology of a\ntheory consists of the ideas that can be expressed in that theory.\nIdeological economy is then a measure of the economy of primitive\nundefined statements employed to reproduce this ideology. The claim\nhere would then be that the ideology of symmetric causal influences is\nmore economical than rejecting a classical ontology. Thus in so far as\nquantum mechanics is telling us something profound about the\nfundamental nature of reality, the hypothesis of retrocausality shows\nthat the lesson of quantum mechanics is not necessarily that the\nquantum ontology can no longer be classical. Some might see this as a\nvirtue of retrocausal approaches. (Although the Shrapnel-Costa no-go\ntheorem reviewed in\n \u00a77.4\n significantly jeopardizes this view.)\n",
