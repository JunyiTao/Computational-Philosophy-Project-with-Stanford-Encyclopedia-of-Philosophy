Natural deduction and sequent calculus\n\n\nIn pursuing his consistency program, Gentzen set as his first task the\nanalysis of purely logical deduction, to be extended later to\narithmetic and analysis. In his thesis (1934\u20131935), Gentzen\nstates that he set as his task the analysis of mathematical proofs as\nthey occur in practice.  The first observation is that actual proofs\nare not based on axioms expressed in a logical language, as in\nHilbert's axiomatic proof theory. The most typical feature is instead\nthat theorems make their claims under some assumptions. The\nassumptions are analyzed into parts and the conclusion is also\nanalyzed into parts until these two analyses meet and a proof can be\nsynthesized.  The latter analysis proceeds by what Gentzen called\nintroduction rules: they give sufficient conditions for deriving a\nproposition of a given form. For example, to derive a conjunction\nA & B, it is sufficient to\nderive the conjuncts A and B separately. The\ninference is given formally as in the rule\n\n\n\nA \u00a0 B\n\n\u00a0&I\n\n\nA & B\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions, instead, are analyzed into their components through \nelimination rules that give, by and large, immediate consequences of \nthe assumptions. For example, a conjunction used as an assumption can\nbe decomposed into its constituents, as in the rules\n\n\n\n\n\nA & B\n\n\u00a0&E1\n\n\nA\n\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\nA & B\n\n\u00a0&E2\n\n\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGentzen developed and studied the system of natural deduction during \n1932, and had arrived by September 1932 at a calculus of natural \ndeduction (ND for short) that is standard today. By this time, he had\nnoticed that if an introduction, say a derivation of \nA & B from A and B separately, \nis followed by the corresponding elimination, say a derivation of \nA, the formula A & B constitutes a local\nmaximum, a \u201chillock\u201d, that can be eliminated. He also \ncalled such hillocks \u201cdetours\u201d, and what is now called a \ndetour conversion removes such unnecessary pairs of \nintroduction-elimination steps. The result of the steps of \n\u201cnormalization\u201d is a derivation in \u201cnormal \nform\u201d.\n\n\nImplication is perhaps more typical of ND than conjunction: to derive\nA \u2283 B, one temporarily assumes A, then \ntries to derive B. If this succeeds, the temporary \nassumption is closed or \u201cdischarged\u201d when the conclusion \nto A \u2283 B is made, as in the schematic derivation\n\n\n\n\t[A] \n\t\u22ee \n\n\nB\n\n\t\u00a0\u2283I\n\n\nA \u2283 B\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the other direction, A \u2283 B can be eliminated \nif a derivation of A has been found, for then B can\nbe concluded:\n\n\n\nA \u2283 B \u00a0 A\n\n  \u00a0\u2283E\n\n\nB\n\n\n\n\n\nIf rule \n\u2283I is followed by \u2283E,\n there is a non-normality that \nis removed by a detour conversion: a derivation of B (and \nwhat follows after it) is constructed by taking the derivation of the\nminor premiss A of the elimination rule and the derivation \nof B from the assumption A in the introduction. \nThese two pieces are combined together into a derivation of \nB that does not have the detour formula \nA \u2283 B. In Gentzen's thesis, all assumptions are \nin the end closed by implication introductions, but nowadays one \nconsiders also derivations that leave a collection of formulas as \nopen assumptions.\n\n\nLooking at the rules of conjunction and implication, one notes that \nthe premisses (the formulas immediately above the inference line) are\nsubformulas of the conclusion in the I-rules, whereas it is the other\nway around in the E-rules. Gentzen noticed that in normal \nderivations, this property of single steps is inherited by the whole \nderivation, in the sense that all formulas are subformulas of the \nconclusion. This result gave as a byproduct a decision method for \n intuitionistic propositional logic.\n Another corollary was a syntactic proof of consistency: if a \ncontradiction is provable, anything is provable, but an atomic \nformula, say, has no proof: if it has a proof, it has a normal proof,\nbut no E-rules apply to an atomic formula, and no I-rule concludes it\neither.\n\n\nGentzen's idea was to extend natural deduction to a system of \narithmetic by the addition of a rule that corresponds to the \nprinciple of complete induction. Consistency would then follow from \nthe normalization of derivations and the subformula property. By \nearly 1933, Gentzen realized that this proof strategy would not go \nthrough: the induction rule is schematic and has an infinity of \ninstances, with no bound on the complexity of the induction formulas.\nIt would be impossible to restrict these formulas in advance, thus no\nsubformula property can hold. After this failure, Gentzen took \nverbatim out of his early thesis manuscript the translation from \nclassical to intuitionistic arithmetic and submitted it as a paper in\nMarch 1933, but withdrew the paper after hearing of G\u00f6del's \npublication of the result.\n\n\nGentzen wrote that he was unable to prove a normalization theorem for\na classical system of ND. He therefore invented another logical \ncalculus that he called sequent calculus (Sequenzenkalkul, \nliterally \u201ccalculus of sequences\u201d) and made it the \ncentral topic of his thesis. The name of the calculus comes from the \nrepresentation of assumptions of a derivation as a list. The word \n\u201csequent\u201d used as a noun is a suggestion of Kleene's in \nhis Introduction to Metamathematics (1952: 441), taken up \nin many languages in the form of purely invented words.\n Sequent calculus, SC for short, can be seen as a formal\nrepresentation of the derivability relation in natural deduction. A\nsequent consists of a list \u0393 of formulas, an arrow (in Gentzen,\nlater also other markers have been used), and one formula as a\nconclusion. The list gives the assumptions the conclusion depends on\nin a derivation, in a local notation where in ND they are found in the\nleaves of a derivation tree. Gentzen also generalized sequents so that\nthey have, instead of one conclusion, a list of possible cases after\nthe arrow. This novelty led to the first satisfactory formulation of a\nproof system for classical logic. Gentzen's SC rules for conjunction\nand implication are, with commas separating elements in lists:\n\n\n\nConjunction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u0393 \u2192 \u0394, A \u00a0 \u0393 \u2192 \u0394, B\n\n  \u00a0R&\n\n\n  \u0393 \u2192 \u0394, A & B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n \u00a0L&1\n\n\nA & B, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n  \u00a0L&2\n\n\nA & B, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA, \u0393 \u2192 \u0394, B\n\n  \u00a0R\u2283\n\n\n \u0393 \u2192 \u0394, A \u2283 B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u0393 \u2192 \u0398, A \u00a0 B, \u0394 \u2192 \u039b\n\n \u00a0L\u2283\n\n\nA \u2283 B, \u0393, \u0394 \u2192 \u0398, \u039b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not the place to explain the details of ND and SC (but see the\nentry on automated\nreasoning).  Gentzen formulated the latter, denoted LK, so that it\ngave an intuitionistic calculus, denoted LJ, as a special case, the\none in which the conclusion is a list of at most one case. He then\nproved the analogue of the normalization theorem for the classical\ncalculus, the calculus and the proof carefully formulated so that the\nresult for the intuitionistic calculus was a special case of the one\nfor the classical calculus. In LJ and LK, L stands for\n\u201clogistic\u201d, a term by which Gentzen refers to the\naxiomatic calculi of logic of Frege, Russell, and Hilbert and\nBernays. In such calculi, each line in a derivation is correct in\nitself, i.e., a logical truth, whence the term. The letters K and J\ncome from the German words klassisch and\nintuitionistisch. (The latter should thus be upper case \"I\",\nbut older German uses upper case \"J\" for upper case \"I\".)\n\n\nGentzen called the analogue of normalization by the unimaginative \nname of Hauptsatz, \u201cmain theorem\u201d. The standard \nterminology today is \u201ccut elimination theorem\u201d All of the\nlogical rules of SC have the subformula property in a very immediate \nsense: each formula in a premiss is a formula or subformula in the \nconclusion. The rule for combining derivations, analogous to the one \nexplained above for the case of detour conversions in ND, is called \n\u201ccut\u201d. In it, a formula A appears as a case in a\nfirst premiss and as an assumption in a second premiss. In the \nconclusion, this formula has disappeared and the assumptions of the \ntwo premisses collected together:\n\n\n\n \u0393 \u2192 A \u00a0 A, \u0394 \u2192 C\n\n \u00a0Cut\n\n\n \u0393, \u0394 \u2192 C\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, cut is the only rule that makes a formula \n\u201cdisappear\u201d in a derivation. Gentzen showed that \ninstances of the rule of cut can be eliminated from derivations by \npermuting them upward until they reach points at which the derivation\nstarts. In ND, the starting points are assumptions, in SC they are \n\u201cinitial sequents\u201d of the form \nA \u2192 A in which the assumption \nformula A is at the same time the conclusion. A cut with \nsuch a sequent as one premiss has the other premiss equal to the \nconclusion and can therefore be deleted.\n\n\nAfter the proof of cut elimination, Gentzen had no use for the proof \nof normalization for intuitionistic natural deduction. He gave the \nfirst handwritten version of his thesis, with the detailed proof of \nnormalization (equivalent to some 13 printed pages) to Bernays, but \nthe latter seems never to have realized what he had in his hands. The\nproof, among the papers of Bernays in Zurich, was discovered by the \npresent author in February 2005 and is now available in an English \ntranslation (Gentzen 1933 [2008]). \n",
