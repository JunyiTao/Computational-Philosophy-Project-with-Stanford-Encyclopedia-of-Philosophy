Consider a subject who has looked around a tree sensing a\nsequence of sense-data. In these circumstances the subject has what\nPrice calls a settled conviction about the existence and character of\nthe tree. This is not mere acceptance but a new attitude which has\nsurvived challenges and counts as rational belief, passing Cook\nWilson\u2019s conditions that Price relied on when arguing that the\ninitial cases are not cases of belief. Then he asks: How can simple\nsensings of sense-data validate this new attitude? His response:\ngathering the relevant experiences simply does count as a rational\nconfirmation of the claims in question. This yields Price\u2019s\nPrinciple of Confirmability:\n\n\nClearly we shall have to say that the existence of a particular visual\nor tactual sense-datum is prima facie evidence (1) for the existence\nof a material thing such that this sense-datum belongs to it, (2) for\nthe possession by this thing of a front surface of a certain general\nsort. (1932: 185)\n\n\nTo Price, this principle is evident, not derivable from anything more\nbasic, but equally not refutable by any considerations (for\ndiscussion: Lemos 2004: 136\u2013137). Crucially, although our\nexperiences confirm the claims about the material objects around us,\nthey don\u2019t yield knowledge that there are material objects: the\nconfirmation doesn\u2019t amount to absolute certainty. However, we\ndo have knowledge that these experiences are confirmatory ones. We\ncannot ask for more than that.\n",
