    "main_text": "The Spirit of the Laws || Commerce\n4.5 Religion\n\n\nReligion plays only a minor part in the Spirit of the Laws. God\nis described in Book 1 as creating nature and its laws; having done\nso, He vanishes, and plays no further explanatory role. In particular,\nMontesquieu does not explain the laws of any country by appeal to\ndivine enlightenment, providence, or guidance. In the Spirit of the\nLaws, Montesquieu considers religions \"in relation only to the\ngood they produce in civil society\" (SL 24.1), and not to their truth\nor falsity. He regards different religions as appropriate to different\nenvironments and forms of government. Protestantism is most suitable\nto republics, Catholicism to monarchies, and Islam to despotisms; the\nIslamic prohibition on eating pork is appropriate to Arabia, where hogs\nare scarce and contribute to disease, while in India, where cattle are\nbadly needed but do not thrive, a prohibition on eating beef is\nsuitable. Thus, \"when Montezuma with so much obstinacy insisted that\nthe religion of the Spaniards was good for their country, and his for\nMexico, he did not assert an absurdity\" (SL 24.24).\n\n Religion can help to ameliorate the effects of bad laws and\ninstitutions; it is the only thing capable of serving as a check on\ndespotic power. However, on Montesquieu's view it is generally a\nmistake to base civil laws on religious principles. Religion aims at\nthe perfection of the individual; civil laws aim at the welfare of\nsociety. Given these different aims, what these two sets of laws\nshould require will often differ; for this reason religion \"ought not\nalways to serve as a first principle to the civil laws\" (SL 26.9). The\ncivil laws are not an appropriate tool for enforcing religious norms\nof conduct: God has His own laws, and He is quite capable of enforcing\nthem without our assistance. When we attempt to enforce God's laws for\nHim, or to cast ourselves as His protectors, we make our religion an\ninstrument of fanaticism and oppression; this is a service neither to\nGod nor to our country.\n\n If several religions have gained adherents in a country, those\nreligions should all be tolerated, not only by the state but by its\ncitizens. The laws should \"require from the several religions, not\nonly that they shall not embroil the state, but that they shall not\nraise disturbances among themselves\" (SL 25.9). While one can try to\npersuade people to change religions by offering them positive\ninducements to do so, attempts to force others to convert are\nineffective and inhumane. In an unusually scathing passage,\nMontesquieu also argues that they are unworthy of Christianity, and\nwrites: \"if anyone in times to come shall dare to assert, that in the\nage in which we live, the people of Europe were civilized, you (the\nInquisition) will be cited to prove that they were barbarians; and the\nidea they will have of you will be such as will dishonor your age, and\nspread hatred over all your contemporaries\" (SL 25.13).\n",
