    "main_text": "State and Politics || The State in Capitalist Society\n7.1 The State in Capitalist Society\n\nMarx offers no unified theoretical account of the state in capitalist\nsociety. Instead his remarks on this topic are scattered across the\ncourse of his activist life, and deeply embedded in discussions of\ncontemporary events, events which most modern readers will know very\nlittle about. Providing some initial order to that complexity, Jon\nElster helpfully identifies three different models in Marx\u2019s\nwritings of the relationship, in capitalist society, between the\npolitical state, on the one hand, and the economically dominant class,\non the other. (The next three paragraphs draw heavily on Elster 1985:\n409\u2013437.)\n\nFirst, the \u201cinstrumental\u201d model portrays the state as\nsimply a tool, directly controlled by the economically dominant class,\nin its own interests, at the expense of the interests both of other\nclasses and of the community as a whole. Marx is usually said to\nendorse the instrumental account in the Communist Manifesto,\nwhere he and Engels insist that \u201cthe executive of the modern\nstate is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole\nbourgeoisie\u201d (MECW 6: 486). On this account, the state\nmight also act against the short term, or the factional, interests of\nparticular capitalists. The picture here is of the state as an\ninstrument directed\u2014presumably by a subset of capitalists or\ntheir representatives\u2014in ways which promote the long term\ninterests of the bourgeoisie as a whole. The precise mechanisms which\nmight facilitate that result are not clear in Marx\u2019s\nwritings.\n\nSecond, the \u201cclass balance\u201d model portrays the state as\nhaving interests of its own, with capitalist interests as merely one\nof the strategic limits on its pursuit of these. This model gets its\nname from the exceptional social circumstances said to explain the\nindependence of the state in this case. In situations where the social\npower of the two warring classes of contemporary\nsociety\u2014capitalists and workers\u2014are very nearly balanced,\nthe political state (and especially the executive) can gain\nindependence from both, exploiting that conflict in order to promote\nits own interests (the interests of the political caste). Something\nlike this picture appears in Marx\u2019s discussions of the continued\nexistence of certain absolutist states after the revolutions of 1848,\nand of the Bonapartist state established in France by the coup of\nNapoleon III in December 1851. The state now competes with capitalists\nand proletarians (and is not merely the tool of the former), and by\n\u201cpromising each of the major classes to protect it against the\nother, the government can rule autonomously\u201d (Elster 1985: 425).\nOn this account, the state has interests of its own, but presumably\nonly gets to pursue them if those promises to others are plausible,\nfinding some reflection in its policies and behaviour. Capitalist\ninterests accordingly remain a political constraint, but they are now\nonly one of the factors constraining the state\u2019s actions rather\nthan constituting its primary goal.\n\nThird, the \u201cabdication\u201d model presents the bourgeoisie as\nstaying away from the direct exercise of political power, but doing\nthis because it is in their economic interests to do so. As Elster\nnotes, strictly speaking, \u201cabdication\u201d here covers two\nslightly different cases\u2014first, where the bourgeoisie\nabdicate from the political power that they initially\ncontrolled (relevant to France); and, second, where the bourgeoisie\nabstain from taking political power in the first place\n(relevant to Britain and Germany)\u2014but they can be treated\ntogether. In both cases, Marx identifies a situation where \u201cin\norder to save its purse, [the bourgeoisie] must forfeit the\ncrown\u201d (MECW 11: 143). Where the instrumental picture\nclaims that the state acts in the interests of the capitalist class\nbecause it is directly controlled by the latter, the\nabdication picture advances an explanatory connection between\nthe promotion of bourgeois interests and the retreat from the direct\nexercise of power. Circumstances obtain where \u201cthe political\nrule of the bourgeoisie\u201d turns out to be\n\u201cincompatible\u201d with its continued economic flourishing,\nand the bourgeoisie seeks \u201cto get rid of its own political rule\nin order to get rid of the troubles and dangers of ruling\u201d\n(MECW 11: 173). There are several possible explanations of\nwhy the bourgeoisie might remain outside of politics in order to\npromote their own interests. To give three examples: the bourgeoisie\nmight recognise that their own characteristic short-termism could be\nfatal to their own interests if they exercised direct political as\nwell as economic power; the bourgeoisie might find political rule\nsufficiently time and effort consuming to withdraw from it,\ndiscovering that the economic benefits kept on coming regardless; or\nthe bourgeoisie might appreciate that abdication weakened their class\nopponents, forcing the proletariat to fight on two fronts (against\ncapital and government) and thereby making it less able to win those\nstruggles.\n\nThere are many questions one might have about these three models.\n\nFirst, one might wonder which of these three models best embodies\nMarx\u2019s considered view? The instrumental account is the earliest\naccount, which he largely abandons from the early 1850s, presumably\nnoticing how poorly it captured contemporary political\nrealities\u2014in particular, the stable existence of states which\nwere not directly run by the capitalist class, but which still in some\nway served their interests. That outcome is possible under either of\nthe two other accounts. However, Marx seems to have thought of the\nclass balance model as a temporary solution in exceptional\ncircumstances, and perhaps held that it failed to allow the stable\nexplanatory connection that he sought between the extant political\narrangements and the promotion of dominant economic interests. In\nshort, for better or worse, Marx\u2019s considered view looks closer\nto the abdication account, reflecting his conviction that the central\nfeatures of political life are explained by the existing economic\nstructure.\n\nSecond, one might wonder which model allows greatest\n\u201cautonomy\u201d to the political state? A weak definition of\nstate autonomy might portray the state as autonomous when it is\nindependent of direct control by the economically dominant class. On\nthis definition, both the class balance and abdication\nmodels\u2014but not the instrumental account\u2014seem to provide\nfor autonomy. A stronger definition of state autonomy might require\nwhat Elster calls \u201cexplanatory autonomy\u201d, which exists\n\n\nwhen (and to the extent that) its structure and policies cannot be\nexplained by the interest of an economically dominant class. (Elster\n1985: 405)\n\n\nOnly the class balance view seems to allow significant explanatory\nautonomy. In his preferred abdication account, Marx allows that the\nstate in capitalist society is independent of direct capitalist\ncontrol, but goes on to claim that its main structures (including that\nvery independence) and policies are ultimately explained by the\ninterests of the capitalist class.\n7.2. The Fate of the State in Communist Society\n\nFor reasons discussed below (see\n Section 8),\n Marx declines to say much about the basic structure of a future\ncommunist society. However, in the case of the fate of the state, that\nreluctance is partially mitigated by his view that the institutional\narrangements of the Paris Commune prefigured the political dimensions\nof communist society.\n\nMarx\u2019s views on the nature and fate of the state in communist\nsociety are to be distinguished from his infrequent, and subsequently\nnotorious, use of the term \u201cthe dictatorship of the\nproletariat\u201d. (On the infrequency, context, and content, of\nthese uses see Draper 1986 and Hunt 1974.) The idea of\n\u201cdictatorship\u201d in this historical context has the\n(ancient) connotation of emergency rule rather than the (modern)\nconnotation of totalitarianism. Marx\u2019s use makes it clear that\nany such temporary government should be democratic; for instance, in\nhaving majority support, and in preserving democratic rights (of\nspeech, association, and so on). However, it is by definition\n\u201cextra-legal\u201d in that it seeks to establish a new regime\nand not to preserve an old one. So understood, the dictatorship of the\nproletariat forms part of the political transition to communist\nsociety (a topic not covered here), rather than part of the\ninstitutional structure of communist society itself. The\n\u201cdictatorial\u201d\u2014that is, the temporary and\nextra-legal\u2014character of this regime ends with establishment of\na new and stable polity, and it is the latter which is discussed here\n(Hunt 1974: 297).\n\nThe character of the state in communist society consists, in part, of\nits form (its institutional arrangements) and its function (the tasks\nthat it undertakes).\n\nSome sense of the form of the state in communist society can\nbe gained from Marx\u2019s engagement with the Paris Commune. His\npreferred future political arrangements involve a high degree of\nparticipation, and the radical \u201cde-professionalisation\u201d of\ncertain public offices. First, Marx is enthusiastic about regular\nelections, universal suffrage, mandat imp\u00e9ratif,\nrecall, open executive proceedings, decentralisation, and so on.\nSecond, he objects to public offices (in the legislature, executive,\nand judiciary) being the spoils of a political caste, and sought to\nmake them working positions, remunerated at the average worker\u2019s\nwage, and regularly circulating (through election). This combination\nof arrangements has been characterised as \u201cdemocracy without\nprofessionals\u201d (Hunt 1974: 365). Marx saw it as reflecting his\nview that:\n\n\nFreedom consists in converting the state from an organ superimposed\nupon society into one completely subordinate to it. (MECW 24:\n94)\n\n\nSome sense of the function of the state in communist society\ncan be gained from Marx\u2019s distinction between\n\u201cnecessary\u201d tasks that a state would need to undertake in\nall societies (at least, economically developed societies), and\n\u201cunnecessary\u201d tasks that a state would only need to\nundertake in class-divided societies. The difficulty here is less in\nallowing this distinction, than in deciding what might fall into each\ncategory. On the necessary side, Marx appears to require that the\nstate in communist society provide both: democratic solutions to\ncoordination problems (deciding which side of the road traffic should\ndrive on, for instance); and the supply of public goods (health,\nwelfare, education, and so on). On the unnecessary side, Marx seems to\nthink that a communist society might hugely reduce, or even eliminate,\nthe element of organised coercion found in most states (in the form of\nstanding armies, police forces, and so on). At least, this reduction\nmight be feasible once communist society had reached its higher stage\n(where distribution is based on \u201cthe needs principle\u201d),\nand there is no longer a threat from non-communist societies.\n\nAgain, there are many reservations that one might have about this\naccount.\n\nFirst, many will be sceptical about its feasibility, and perhaps\nespecially of the purported reduction, still less elimination, of\nstate coercion. That scepticism might be motivated by the thought that\nthis would only be possible if communist society were characterised by\nwidespread social and political consensus, and that such consensus is,\nboth unlikely (at least, in modern societies), and undesirable\n(diversity and disagreement having a value). However, the reduction,\nor even elimination, of state coercion might be compatible with\ncertain forms of continuing disagreement about the ends and means of\ncommunist society. Imagine that a democratic communist polity\nintroduces a new law prohibiting smoking in public places, and that a\nrepresentative smoker (call her Anne) obeys that law despite being\namong the minority who wanted this practice permitted. Anne\u2019s\nmotivation for obedience, we can stipulate, is grounded, not in fear\nof the likely response of bodies of armed persons enforcing the law,\nbut rather in respect for the democratic majority of the community of\nwhich she is a part. In short, reasonably strong assumptions about the\ndemocratic commitments of individuals might allow the scaling down of\norganised coercion without having to presume universal agreement\namongst citizens on all issues.\n\nSecond, some might object to the reference, throughout this section,\nto the \u201cstate\u201d in communist society. It might be said that\na polity whose form and functions are so radically\ntransformed\u2014the form by democratic participation and\nde-professionalisation, the function by eliminating historically\nunnecessary tasks\u2014is insufficiently \u201cstate-like\u201d to\nbe called a state. That is certainly possible, but the terminological\nclaim would appear to assume that there is greater clarity and\nagreement about just what a state is, either than is presupposed here\nor than exists in the world. Given that lack of consensus,\n\u201cstate\u201d seems a suitably prudent choice. As well as being\nconsistent with some of Marx\u2019s usage, it avoids prejudging this\nvery issue. However, anyone unmoved by those considerations can simply\nreplace \u201cstate\u201d, in this context, with their own preferred\nalternative.\n8. Utopianism\n8.1 Utopian Socialism\n\nIt is well-known that Marx never provided a detailed account of the\nbasic structure of the future communist society that he predicted.\nThis was not simply an omission on his part, but rather reflects his\ndeliberate commitment, as he colloquially has it, to refrain from\nwriting \u201crecipes\u201d for the \u201crestaurants\u201d of the\nfuture (MECW 35: 17, translation amended).\n\nThe reasoning that underpins this commitment can be reconstructed from\nMarx\u2019s engagement with the radical political tradition that he\ncalled \u201cutopian socialism\u201d, and whose founding triumvirate\nwere Charles Fourier (1772\u20131837), Henri Saint-Simon\n(1760\u20131825), and Robert Owen (1771\u20131858). Note that the\ndistinction between Marxian socialism and utopian socialism is not an\nexhaustive one. Marx happily allows that there are socialists who are\nneither Marxian nor Utopian; for example, the \u201cfeudal\nsocialists\u201d discussed in the Communist Manifesto.\n\nWhat distinguishes utopian from other socialists is, in large part,\ntheir view that providing persuasive constructive plans and\nblueprints of future socialist arrangements is a legitimate and\nnecessary activity. (The expression \u201cplans and blueprints\u201d\nis used here to capture the necessary detail of these\ndescriptions, and not to suggest that these designs have to be thought\nof as \u201cstipulative\u201d, as having to be followed to the\nletter.) On the utopian account, the socialist future needs to be\ndesigned before it can be delivered; the plans and blueprints being\nintended to guide and motivate socialists in their transformative\nambitions. Of course, that Marx is not in this sense utopian\ndoes not rule out the possibility of additional (here unspecified)\nsenses in which he might accurately be so described.\n\nMarx\u2019s account of utopian socialism might appear contradictory.\nIt is certainly easy to find not only passages fiercely criticising\nutopian authors and texts, but also passages generously praising them.\nHowever, that criticism and that praise turn out to attach to slightly\ndifferent targets, revealing an underlying and consistent structure to\nhis account.\n\nThat underlying structure rests on two main distinctions. The first\ndistinction is a chronological one running between the\nfounding triumvirate, on the one hand, and second and subsequent\ngenerations of utopian socialists, on the other. (These later\ngenerations including both loyal followers of the founding\ntriumvirate, and independent later figures such as \u00c9tienne\nCabet (1788\u20131856)). The second distinction is a\nsubstantive one running between the critical part of utopian\nwritings (the portrayal of faults within contemporary capitalist\nsociety), on the one hand, and the constructive part of utopian\nwritings (the detailed description of the ideal socialist future), on\nthe other.\n\nNote that these distinctions underpin the asymmetry of Marx\u2019s\nassessment of utopian socialism. Simply put: he is more enthusiastic\nand positive about the achievements of the first generation of\nutopians, by comparison with those of second and subsequent\ngenerations; and he is more enthusiastic and positive about the\nutopians\u2019 criticism of contemporary society, by comparison with\nthe utopians\u2019 constructive endeavours.\n8.2 Marx\u2019s Utopophobia\n\nThe remainder of this section will focus on Marx\u2019s disapproval\nof the constructive endeavours of the utopians.\n\nIn trying to organise and understand Marx\u2019s various criticisms\nof utopianism, it is helpful to distinguish between foundational and\nnon-foundational variants. (This distinction is intended to be\nexhaustive, in that all of his criticisms of utopianism will fall into\none of these two categories.) Non-foundational criticisms of\nutopian socialism are those which, if sound, would provide us with a\nreason to reject views which might be held by, or even be\ncharacteristic of, utopian socialists, but which are not constitutive\nof their utopianism. That is, they would give us a reason to abandon\nthe relevant beliefs, or to criticise those (including utopians) who\nheld them, but they would not give us cause to reject utopianism as\nsuch. In contrast, foundational criticisms of utopian\nsocialism are those which, if sound, would provide us with a reason to\nreject utopianism as such; that is, a reason to refrain from engaging\nin socialist design, a reason not to describe in relevant detail the\nsocialist society of the future. (Of course, that reason might not be\ndecisive, all things considered, but it would still count against\nutopianism per se.)\n\nMany of Marx\u2019s best-known criticisms of utopian socialism are\nnon-foundational. For instance, in the Communist Manifesto,\nhe complains that utopian socialists hold a mistaken\n\u201cahistorical\u201d view of social change. The utopians\npurportedly fail to understand that the achievement of socialism\ndepends on conditions which can only emerge at a certain stage of\nhistorical development. They might, for instance, recognise that there\nare strategic preconditions for socialism (for instance, the right\nblueprint and sufficient will to put it into practice), but\n(mistakenly on Marx\u2019s account) imagine that those preconditions\ncould have appeared at any point in time. This complaint is\nnon-foundational in that one can accept that there are historical\nconditions for establishing a socialist society, and that the utopian\nsocialists fail to understand this, without thereby having a reason to\nabandon utopianism as such. A commitment to the necessity and\ndesirability of socialist design does not require one to hold an\n\u201cahistorical\u201d view of social change.\n\nAssessing the soundness of non-foundational criticisms, and their\nrelevance to the utopian socialist tradition, is a complicated task\n(see Leopold 2018). However, even if sound and relevant, these\ncriticisms would provide no reason to abandon utopianism as\nsuch. Consequently, they are pursued no further here. Instead,\nthe focus is on the three main foundational arguments against\nutopianism that can be located in Marx\u2019s writings; namely, that\nutopian plans and blueprints are necessarily undemocratic,\nimpossible, and redundant (see Leopold 2016).\n\nMarx\u2019s first argument involves a normative claim that\nutopian plans and blueprints are undemocratic.\n(\u201cDemocracy\u201d here connoting individual and collective\nself-determination, rather than political forms of governance.) The\nbasic argument runs: that it is undemocratic to limit the\nself-determination of individuals; that providing a plan or blueprint\nfor a socialist society limits the self-determination of individuals;\nand that therefore the provision of plans and blueprints for a\nsocialist society is undemocratic. If we add in the assumption that\nundemocratic means are undesirable; then we can conclude that it is\nundesirable to provide plans or blueprints of a future socialist\nsociety. One central reason for resisting this argument is that it is\nhard to identify a plausible account of the conditions for\nself-determination, according to which it is necessarily true that\nmerely providing a socialist plan or blueprint restricts\nself-determination. Indeed, one might heretically think that detailed\nplans and blueprints often tend to promote self-determination, helping\nindividuals think about where it is they want to go, and how they want\nto get there.\n\nMarx\u2019s second argument rests on an epistemological\nclaim that that utopian plans and blueprints are impossible,\nbecause they require accurate knowledge of the future of a kind which\ncannot be had. The basic argument starts from the assumption that to\nbe of any use a blueprint must facilitate the construction of a future\nsocialist society. Moreover, to facilitate the construction of a\nfuture socialist society a blueprint must be completely accurate; and\nto be completely accurate a blueprint must predict all the relevant\ncircumstances of that future society. However, since it is not\npossible\u2014given the complexity of the social world and the\nlimitations of human nature\u2014to predict all the relevant\ncircumstances of that future society, we can conclude that socialist\nblueprints are of no use. One central reason for resisting this\nargument is that, whilst it is hard to deny that completely accurate\nplans are impossible (given the complexity of the world and the\nlimitations of human understanding), the claim that only completely\naccurate plans are useful seems doubtful. Plans are not simply\npredictions, and providing less than wholly accurate plans for\nourselves often forms part of the process whereby we help determine\nthe future for ourselves (insofar as that is possible).\n\nMarx\u2019s third argument depends on an empirical claim\nthat utopian plans and blueprints are unnecessary, because\nsatisfactory solutions to social problems emerge automatically from\nthe unfolding of the historical process without themselves needing to\nbe designed. The basic argument runs as follows: that utopian\nblueprints describe the basic structure of the socialist society of\nthe future; and that such blueprints are necessary if and only if the\nbasic structure of future socialist society needs to be designed.\nHowever, given that the basic structure of the future socialist\nsociety develops automatically (without design assistance) within\ncapitalist society; and that the role of human agency in this\nunfolding historical process is to deliver (not design) that basic\nstructure, Marx concludes that utopian blueprints are redundant.\nReasons for resisting this argument include scepticism about both\nMarx\u2019s reasoning and the empirical record. Marx is certain that\nhumankind does not need to design the basic structure of the future\nsocialist society, but it is not really made clear who or what does\nthat designing in its place. Moreover, the path of historical\ndevelopment since Marx\u2019s day does not obviously confirm the\ncomplex empirical claim that the basic structure of socialist society\nis developing automatically within existing capitalism, needing only\nto be delivered (and not designed) by human agency.\n\nThis brief discussion suggests that there are cogent grounds for\ndoubting Marx\u2019s claim that utopian plans and blueprints are\nnecessarily undemocratic, impossible, and redundant.\n\nFinally, recall that Marx is less enthusiastic about the second and\nsubsequent generations of utopians, than he is about the original\ntriumvirate. We might reasonably wonder about the rationale for\ngreater criticism of later utopians. It is important to recognise that\nit is not that second and subsequent generations make more or grosser\nerrors than the original triumvirate. (Indeed, Marx appears to think\nthat all these different generations largely held the same views, and\nmade the same mistakes). The relevant difference is rather that, by\ncomparison with their successors, this first generation were not to\nblame for those errors. In short, the rationale behind Marx\u2019s\npreference for the first over the second and subsequent generations of\nutopian socialists is based on an understanding of historical\ndevelopment and an associated notion of culpability.\n\nMarx held that the intellectual formation of this first generation\ntook place in a historical context (the cusp of the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries) which was sufficiently developed to provoke\nsocialist criticism, but not sufficiently developed for that socialist\ncriticism to escape serious misunderstandings (Cohen 2000: 51). Since\nneither the material conditions of modern society, nor the historical\nagent capable of bringing socialism about, were sufficiently\ndeveloped, this first generation were bound to develop faulty accounts\nof the nature of, and transition to, socialism. However, that\ndefence\u2014the historical unavoidability of error\u2014is not\navailable to subsequent generations who, despite significantly changed\ncircumstances, hold fast to the original views of their intellectual\nforerunners. Marx maintains that more recent utopians, unlike the\noriginal triumvirate, really ought to know better.\n9. Marx\u2019s Legacy\n\nAt this point, we might be expected briefly to survey Marx\u2019s\nlegacy.\n\nThat legacy is often elaborated in terms of movements and thinkers.\nHowever, so understood, the controversy and scale of that legacy make\nbrevity impossible, and this entry is already long enough. All we can\ndo here is gesture at the history and mention some further\nreading.\n\nThe chronology here might provisionally be divided into three\nhistorical periods: from Marx\u2019s death until the Russia\nRevolution (1917); from the Russian Revolution to the fall of the\nBerlin Wall (1989); and since 1989. It seems hard to say much that is\ncertain about the last of these periods, but some generalisations\nabout the first two might be hazarded.\n\nThat first period of \u201cClassical Marxism\u201d can be thought of\nin two generational waves. The first smaller group of theorists was\nassociated with the Second International, and includes Karl Kautsky\n(1854\u20131938) and Plekhanov. The succeeding more activist\ngeneration includes Rosa Luxemburg (1871\u20131919), V.I. Lenin\n(1870\u20131924) and Leon Trotsky (1879\u20131940).\n\nThe second period is perhaps dominated by \u201cSoviet Marxism\u201d\nand the critical reaction from other Marxists that it provoked. The\nrepressive bureaucratic regimes which solidified in the Soviet Union\nand Eastern Europe repressed independent theoretical work, including\nscholarly editorial work on the writings of Marx and Engels. However,\nthey also provoked a critical reaction in the form of a body of\nthought often called \u201cWestern Marxism\u201d, usually said to\ninclude the work of Antonio Gramsci (1891\u20131937), Theodor Adorno\n(1903\u20131969), and Althusser. The later parts of this period saw\nthe continuing development of \u201cCritical Theory\u201d, as well\nas the birth of currents such as \u201cAnalytical Marxism\u201d\nwhose longer term impact is uncertain.\n\nThese first two periods are both partly covered by the Polish\nphilosopher and historian of ideas, Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, in the\nfinal two volumes of his encyclopaedic three volume Main Currents\nof Marxism (1976 [1978]). A succinct critical account of the\nemergence and distinctive character of Western Marxism is provided by\nPerry Anderson in his Considerations on Western Marxism\n(1976). And some of the more philosophically interesting authors in\nthis latter tradition are also covered elsewhere in this Encyclopaedia\n(see the\n Related Entries\n section below). Finally, and edging a little into the third of these\nhistorical periods, Christoph Henning offers an account of the (mis)\nreadings of Marx\u2014especially those replacing social theory with\nmoral philosophy\u2014in German philosophy from Heidegger to Habermas\nand beyond, in his Philosophy After Marx (2014).\n\nHowever, we might also think of Marx\u2019s legacy, less in terms of\nthinkers and movements, and more in terms of reasons for wanting to\nstudy Marx\u2019s ideas. In that context, we would stress that this\nis not simply a question of the truth of his various substantive\nclaims. The work of philosophers is, of course, also valued for the\noriginality, insight, potential, and so on, that it may also contain.\nAnd, so judged, Marx\u2019s writings have much to offer.\n\nThe various strands of Marx\u2019s thought surveyed here include his\nphilosophical anthropology, his theory of history, his critical\nengagement with the economic and political dimensions of capitalism,\nand a frustratingly vague outline of what might replace it. Whatever\nthe connections between these threads, it seems implausible to suggest\nthat Marx\u2019s ideas form a system which has to be swallowed or\nrejected in its entirety. It might, for instance, be that Marx\u2019s\ndiagnosis looks more persuasive than his remedies. Readers may have\nlittle confidence in his solutions, but that does not mean that the\nproblems he identifies are not acute.",
