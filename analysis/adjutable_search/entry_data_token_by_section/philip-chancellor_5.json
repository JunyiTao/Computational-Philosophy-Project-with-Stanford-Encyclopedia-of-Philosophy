    "main_text": "Philip\u2019s Psychology\n6. Philip\u2019s Discussion of Time and Eternity\n\n\nPhilip does not interpret his organizing principle of the good in an\nunduly narrow or restrictive manner. Among the goods of nature he\nconsiders not to be diminishable by evil are time and eternity. After\na discussion of whether good and evil are contraries and whether evil\ncan be a principle or a genus, Philip launches into a discussion of\nwhether the world is eternal and follows that by a comparison of time\nand eternity. The topic of eternity is one of some importance and was\nmuch discussed in the Middle Ages. Medieval philosophers in the\nChristian tradition to which Philip belonged believed that the world\nwas created\nex nihilo by God with a beginning and at some point in time\nwill end. It soon became apparent that the newly rediscovered Aristotle\ndid not share this commitment as he famously argues that the world is\neternal. Thus, this was an issue that medieval philosophers needed to\naddress.\n\n\nPhilip attempts to reconcile Aristotle\u2019s position with his own\ncommitments first by distinguishing the domain of philosophy from the\ndomain of theology, an approach that will appeal to later thinkers as\nwell (see Dales 1990). Not surprisingly, Philip argues that Aristotle\nshould be taken as a philosopher and not as a theologian. But Philip\nalso tries to reinterpret Aristotle\u2019s position so that it will\nbe compatible with his Christian commitments. He argues that strictly\nspeaking, Aristotle\u2019s argument establishes only that the world\nis perpetual, not that it is eternal (see Yarbrough 2015). Philip\ndefines the perpetual as that which is measured in the whole of time\nand mobility. Eternity, on the other hand, is such that it has no\nbeginning and will have no end. Thus, Philip\u2019s concept of the\nperpetual is compatible with the view that what is perpetual has a\nbeginning and an end. The world could have existed for all of time,\nbut since Philip thinks that time has a beginning and will at some\npoint have an end, such an understanding of the world is compatible\nwith the Christian doctrine of creation. Philip also defends his\nposition by arguing that Aristotle\u2019s task is to show that time,\nmotion, and what is movable are all co-equal and that it is not\nappropriate to the discipline of philosophy to demonstrate anything\nbeyond this claim.  Finally, Philip draws upon Averroes (referring to\nhim as the Commentator) to support his claim. He argues that according\nto Averroes\u2019 commentary on the eleventh book of\nAristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, Aristotle is describing the origin of motion from\nthe first mover. Thus, Aristotle is not discussing the origin of the\nworld as such, but rather what takes place once the world exists.\n\n\nIn his comparison between time and eternity, Philip argues that both\nhave duration and as a result are contained in the same genus. But\ntime differs significantly from eternity in a number of important\nrespects.  First, time has a beginning and an end while eternity does\nnot.  Secondly, time by nature has succession and thus, motion, while\neternity does not; it is entirely immobile and immutable. In fact,\nPhilip argues that eternity and the divine essence are the same in\nreality although conceptually distinct. Time of course for Philip is\nsomething created and so cannot be identified with God\u2019s\nessence, which is wholly uncreated. Finally although both time and\neternity involve the idea of \u201cnow,\u201d they do so in\ndifferent respects. The \u201cnow\u201d involves the past and the\nfuture, while the \u201cnow\u201d of time is defined by or comes\nabout in virtue of the past and the future.\n\n\nPhilip also considers the relationship between time and eternity. He\nis concerned with Plato\u2019s position, which he quotes, that\n\u201ctime is a part of eternity.\u201d This is a claim that Philip\nwishes to deny. Although time and eternity are found in the same\ngenus, they differ in character, as I noted above. Philip appeals to\nBoethius\u2019s definition of eternity from The Consolation of\nPhilosophy: \u201cEternity is the possession of unending life,\nwholly present and perfected.\u201d Philip argues that the notion of\n\u201cwholly present\u201d removes the idea of succession from the\nconcept of eternity while the notion of \u201cwholly perfected\u201d\nremoves the idea of division into parts from the concept of\neternity. Succession and division into parts are of course part of the\nnotion of time. Thus, it is incompatible with the nature of eternity\nthat time be a part of it. Rather, Philip views them as two separate\ndurations, each differing in character. No doubt Philip\u2019s\npositions on time and eternity and his interpretation of Aristotle\nraise a number of pressing questions and objections, but as Dales\nnotes, his distinctions greatly influenced thinkers later in the\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries (Dales 1990).\n",
