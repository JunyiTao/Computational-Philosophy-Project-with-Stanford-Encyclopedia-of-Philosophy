    "main_text": "Bolzano\u2019s logic of variation || Propositions and propositional forms\n6.1 Propositions and propositional forms\n\nBolzano\u2019s logic of extensional relations between propositions\nrepresents a major innovation which has no equivalent in traditional\nlogic. It is based on the method of variation that we have already\nencountered. Bolzano introduces this part of his logic as follows:\n\n\nGiven a proposition, we could merely inquire whether it is true or\nfalse. But some very remarkable properties of propositions can be\ndiscovered if, in addition, we consider the truth values of all those\npropositions which can be generated from them, if we take some of\ntheir constituent ideas as variable and replace them by any other\nideas whatever (TS, \u00a7 147). \n\n\nOften, Bolzano uses sentential forms such as \u2018The man A\nis mortal\u2019 in his discussions. At other times, he will simply\nwrite something like this: \u201cLet us \u2026 consider the\nproposition \u2018The man Caius is mortal\u2019, and let us envisage\nthe idea \u2018Caius\u2019 as arbitrarily variable\u201d\n(TS, \u00a7 147).\n\nThese two manners of speaking correspond to two different levels. On\nthe first, linguistic level, we deal with sentential forms, i.e.,\nexpressions containing signs for variables, which become sentences\n(and express propositions) after appropriate substitutions are made.\nThe second level is the level of propositions and ideas in themselves,\nthe level of meaning. Here, Bolzano cannot use variables, letters or\nother indeterminate signs, for, in the realm of the propositions and\nideas in themselves, there are no indeterminate entities that would\ncorrespond to sentential forms; there are only propositions, true or\nfalse. This might be the reason for Bolzano\u2019s cumbersome way of\nspeaking about \u201cthe idea Caius considered\nvariable\u201d.\n\nBolzano\u2019s loose manner of speaking about substitutions of ideas\nin propositions is adopted in what follows. To declare one or several\nideas in a given proposition variable is to consider the class of all\npropositions which have the same structure and contain the same ideas\nexcept perhaps at places occupied by the variable ideas. A proposition\nwhich results from such a substitution performed on the given\nproposition is called a variant.\n\nThe class of allowable substituends is often restricted by Bolzano; in\nsome cases, for instance, he will require that the substitutions do\nnot \u201cdestroy the objectuality of the proposition,\u201d that\nis, do not produce an objectless subject-idea. Such would be, for\nexample, the effect of substituting [Beijing] for [Nero] in the\nproposition [Nero, who is a human being, is mortal]. In his discussion\nof the degree of validity of a proposition relative to certain ideas,\ntoo, he stipulates that no two equivalent ideas may be included in the\nclass of possible substituends. Thus when Bolzano speaks of\n\u201cvariable ideas\u201d, we should bear in mind that the\nspecification of a variable also involves the specification of a range\nof possible values.\n",
