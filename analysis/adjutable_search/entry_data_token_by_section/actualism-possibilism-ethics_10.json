    "main_text": "Actualism || Preliminary Formulations of Actualism\n3.2 Preliminary Formulations of Actualism\n\n\nTo avoid the problem of jointly unfulfillable obligations, Goldman\n(1976: 473) proposes the following version of actualism:\n\n(G*1)\n\n(A)\nS ought at \\(t_1\\) to perform \\(A_1\\) at \\(t_1\\) if and only if:\n\t\n(1)\nS has the ability at \\(t_1\\), to perform \\(A_1\\), and\n(2)\nthe sequence from \\(t_1\\) which would follow \\(A_1\\) is\n\t  better than any sequence from \\(t_1\\) which would follow any\n\t    alternative to \\(A_1\\).\n(B)\nIf S ought at \\(t_1\\), to perform \\(A_i\\) at \\(t_i\\),\n\tthen S ought at \\(t_1\\), to perform an immediate successor\n\t\\(B_j\\) to \\(A_i\\) at \\(t_j\\) if the sequence from \\(t_j\\) which would\n\tfollow \\(B_j\\) is better than any sequence from \\(t_j\\) which would\n\tfollow any other immediate successor to \\(A_i\\).\n\n\nUnlike\n (G),\n (G*1) assesses an act\u2019s deontic status in a procedural manner,\nstarting with the options that are immediately available to the agent,\nand then proceeding to the next immediately available options. To\nillustrate, part (A) of (G*1) tells us to first evaluate all of the\noptions that are immediately performable for Jones at \\(t_1\\), and\nthose options are either \u27e8going to the office\u27e9 or\n\u27e8staying home\u27e9. The latter option is obligatory because\nit would result in a better act-set than the act-set that\nwould result if Jones were to \u27e8go to the office\u27e9. Part\n(B) of (G*1) tells us that, as of \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to perform an\nimmediate successor to \u27e8staying home\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\) that\nwould result in a better sequence of acts than any alternative option\nthat is an immediate successor to \u27e8staying home\u27e9 at\n\\(t_1\\). So, at \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to \u27e8stay home and then do\nresearch for lectures\u27e9 from \\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_2\\). Similarly,\nat \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to perform an act-set that terminates with\n\u27e8writing lecture notes\u27e9 at \\(t_3\\), given the assumption\nthat the act-set that would follow \u27e8writing the lecture\nnotes\u27e9 at \\(t_3\\) is better than the act-set that would follow\n\u27e8fixing lunch\u27e9 at \\(t_3\\).\n\n\nThe application of\n (G*1)\n to the case of Jones explains why (G*1) does not imply the\npossibility of jointly unfulfillable obligations. Although what would\nhappen if Jones were to \u27e8go to the faculty meeting\u27e9 at\n\\(t_2\\) is better than what would happen if she were to do anything\nelse at \\(t_2\\) that, as of \\(t_1\\), she can do, Jones is nevertheless\nnot obligated at \\(t_1\\) to \u27e8go to the faculty\nmeeting\u27e9 at \\(t_2\\). This is because if Jones were to perform\none of the acts required for \u27e8going to the faculty\nmeeting\u27e9, viz. \u27e8going to the office\u27e9, then the\nworst outcome would occur. As of \\(t_1\\), any act that precludes\n\u27e8staying home\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\) is impermissible.\n\n\nJordan Howard Sobel (1976: 196) similarly defends a version of\nactualism that avoids jointly unfulfillable obligations:\n\n(S)\nAn act x ought to take place if and only if (i) x\n  is contained in a life optimum among lives securable by the agent\n  of x at this act\u2019s first moment (that is, a life\n  optimum among those lives each of which would be secured by some\n  fully specific minimal act open to the agent of x at the\n  first moment of x), and (ii) no agent-identical act\n  incompatible with x satisfies (i).\n\n\nA life L is a sequence of acts over time, or, in the\nterminology of this article, an act-set over time, such that this\nact-set is not contained in some other act-set that an agent S\ncan perform over time. Hence, a life is identical to the\npossibilist\u2019s notion of a maximal act-set. A life L is\nsecurable for S at time t if at \\(t\\) \\(S\\) can immediately\nperform the first moment of x, x is in L, and if\nx were to occur, then L would occur (Sobel 1976: 199).\nAn obligatory life is determined in part by the set of immediately\nperformable fully specific minimal acts available to the agent. A\nminimal act is one whose completion cannot be stopped by the agent\nonce it is initiated. As such, all instantaneous acts are minimal acts\n(if there are any such acts). Moreover, a minimal act is fully\nspecific just in case it is not entailed by two or more minimal acts\navailable to the agent.\n\nLike\n (G*1),\n and unlike\n (G),\n (S) does not imply that Jones ought to do the best she can over time\nin the sense affirmed by possibilists. This is because, according to\n(S), all lives that contain \u27e8voting for the language\nrequirement\u27e9 are not securable for Jones at \\(t_1\\). At\n\\(t_1\\), there is no fully specific minimal act that Jones can\nimmediately perform such that if Jones were to perform it then Jones\nwould perform a sequence of acts that includes \u27e8voting for the\nlanguage requirement\u27e9. Similarly, \u27e8writing the\nreview\u27e9 is not securable for Procrastinate at \\(t_1\\) because,\nat \\(t_1\\), there is no fully specific minimal act that Jones can\nimmediately perform such that, if Jones were to perform it, then Jones\nwould \u27e8write the review\u27e9.\n",
