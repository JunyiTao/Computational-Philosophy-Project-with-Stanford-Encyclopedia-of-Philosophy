    "main_text": "Extensions and Elaborations || Evolvability\n6.4 Evolvability\n\nDarwin\u2019s theory is intended to explain adaptation (see the entry\non\n adaptationism).\n The previous two sections have already touched on the general\nconditions required for novel cultural adaptations to emerge over\ntime. In the organic realm, these conditions are sometimes understood\nunder the general heading of \u201cevolvability\u201d. The\nphilosophical analysis of cultural evolutionary evolvability has been\npioneered in recent years by Kim Sterelny (e.g., 2001, 2003, 2006a,\n2006b, 2007, 2012, 2021a). Once again, let us illustrate the general\nnature of these issues by beginning in the organic realm.\n\nThe basic conditions required for natural selection\u2014offspring\nthat resemble their parents with respect to fitness enhancing\ntraits\u2014do not suffice for the appearance of functional traits\neven if they may help explain it. The environment also needs to\ncooperate: if selective pressures change very quickly then there will\nbe no sustained environmental demands of the sort that might build\ncomplex adaptations over time (Boyd & Richerson 1985). Development\nalso matters. If ontogeny is set up in such a way that changes to any\none trait tend to be accompanied by changes to all other traits, then\ncumulative adaptation will be hard to come by. Even in those cases\nwhere a mutation contributes positively to the function of one trait,\nthe chances are that it will contribute negatively to fitness in\nvirtue of disrupting the functioning of other traits (though, see\nBrown 2021). Development also needs to make a wide range of variation\navailable. If it is highly constrained, so that only a small number of\nforms are possible, then selection is not presented with a broad\nenough range of raw materials from which to fashion complex\ntraits.\n\nIt also seems that cumulative adaptation relies on the suppression of\n\u201coutlaws\u201d (Sterelny 2001, 2006b, 2016, 2021b). Group\nselection is often held to be an ineffective agent of group-level\nadaptation, on the grounds that it is vulnerable to \u201csubversion\nfrom within\u201d. This occurs when individual organisms go it alone,\nsabotaging complex features of group organization in favor of their\nown fitness (Birch 2017). Individual-level selection, in contrast, can\nbuild individual-level adaptations. This is because, by and large,\ngenes in a given human organism share a \u201ccommon\nfate\u201d\u2014they do not behave as though they were in direct\ncompetition, struggling for representation in future generations. When\ngenes genuinely \u201cgo it alone\u201d, for example by sabotaging\nmeiosis so that some have greater chances of appearing in future\ngenerations than others, then the overall integrity of the organism\ncan be compromised, and individual-level adaptation is undermined.\n\nBy applying these sorts of considerations to the cultural realm we can\nunderstand the likely costs and benefits associated with different\nmodes and forms of cultural inheritance (vertical, oblique, meme-like\nand so forth). We can also understand the different evolutionary\nforces that might bring these different forms of cultural inheritance\ninto existence. In turn, these insights may facilitate comparative\nwork that documents the general conditions required for a species to\nmake use of cultural inheritance in order to build complex adaptations\nsuch as tools. This way of thinking offers the promise, for example,\nof explaining why few, if any, non-human species build progressively\nmore and more complex cultural features in a cumulative manner\n(Richerson & Boyd 2005: 107; see also Laland 2017).\n\nQuestions relating to evolvability are also tied up with difficult\nissues relating to the units-of-selection debate (Okasha 2006). As we\nhave seen, natural selection at a higher level of organization may be\nrequired to generate mechanisms that suppress the ability of\ndisruptive \u201coutlaws\u201d to go it alone at lower levels of\norganization. Does something like this occur in the cultural realm?\nDoes selection on human groups act so as to limit the ability of\nindividual humans to go it alone? In what ways might cultural\ninheritance be involved in these processes? These questions are\ncomplex, both in terms of how they should be posed and how they should\nbe answered. But some of the most interesting work in cultural\nevolutionary theory may come from efforts to answer them.\n",
