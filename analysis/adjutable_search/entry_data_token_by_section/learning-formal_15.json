    "main_text": "The Long Run in the Short Run: Reliable and Stable Beliefs || Example: The New Riddle of Induction\n4.1 Example: The New Riddle of Induction\n\nThe New Riddle of Induction turns out to be a nice illustration of\nthis idea. Consider the natural projection rule (conjecture that all\nemeralds are green on a sample of green emeralds). If all emeralds are\ngreen, this rule never changes its conjecture. And if all emeralds are\ngrue\\((t)\\) for some critical time \\(t\\), then the natural\nprojection rule abandons its conjecture \u201call emeralds are\ngreen\u201d at time \\(t\\)\u2014one mind change\u2014and\nthereafter correctly projects \u201call emeralds are\ngrue\\((t)\\)\u201d. Remarkably, rules that project grue rather\nthan green do not do as well. For example, consider a rule that\nconjectures that all emeralds are grue(3) after observing one green\nemerald. If two more green emeralds are observed, the rule\u2019s\nconjecture is falsified and it must eventually change its mind, say to\nconjecture that all emeralds are green (supposing that green emeralds\ncontinue to be found). But then at that point, a blue emerald may\nappear, forcing a second mind change. This argument can be generalized\nto show that  the aim of minimizing mind changes allows only the\ngreen predicate to be projected on a sample of all green emeralds \n[Schulte 1999]. We saw in\n Section 1.2\n above how the natural projection rule changes its mind at most once;\nthe figure below illustrates in a typical case how an unnatural\nprojection rule may have to change its mind twice or more.\n\n\nFigure 7 [An extended description of figure 7 is in a supplement.]\n\n",
