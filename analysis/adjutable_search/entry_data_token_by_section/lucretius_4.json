    "main_text": "Natural science\n5. Natural science\n\nEpicurus advanced atomist explanations to an unsurpassed degree, yet\nEpicurean science remained subordinate to the ethical aim of freeing\nus from anxiety in the quest for peace of mind (Key doctrines\n10\u201313, Letter to Herodotus 37 and 81, Letter\nto Pythocles 85). In Lucretius, this ethical goal is\noften left implicit, with ethical material concentrated in the proems\n(see section 6). Officially, Lucretius proposes two programs for the\nwork as a whole. The first curriculum (1.50\u201361) announces the\npoem\u2019s subject as \u2018the high system of heaven and the\ngods\u2019 and the primordia rerum, \u2018first-beginnings\nof things\u2019, in other words, a cosmology, including gods as part\nof the world, the whole underwritten by a set of first principles.\nThis is a fairly standard ancient scientific program. But Lucretius\nimmediately follows that up with the claim that it is not science, but\nreligion, specifically the human fear of divine governance, that\noppresses mankind and ruins happiness. We are then told, in a second\ncurriculum (1.127\u201335), that the nature of soul must be joined to\nthe previous topics, to dispel such fear. The two together cover the\nfull Epicurean project, although Lucretius does not formally\nsubordinate the first to the second.\nBook 1\n\nBook 1 introduces the foundational principles of the system, atoms and\nvoid.\n1.147\u2013482: Causation, method, and metaphysics.\n\nLucretius starts from the observed regularities of nature to argue\nthat nothing comes from nothing and nothing is reduced to nothing\n(147\u2013264). We then get a first methodological point that even\ninvisible bodies can have observable effects. Lucretius supports the\nclaim by reference to air and wind and illustrates it through an epic\nsimile offering an analogy between a windstorm and a mountain river in\nflood and extends the point by noting the inability of the individual\nsenses to perceive the other senses\u2019 \u2018proper\nsensibles\u2019 (265\u2013328). Lucretius next makes the case for\nvoid as necessary for motion, or rather that motion is inconceivable\nwithout void, and rebuts some counter examples (329\u2013417).\nFollowing that, \u2018the all\u2019, that is the universe, is\nasserted to consist of body and void; these two are the only per\nse entities, no third per se thing being conceivable.\nAll other things therefore are dependent on these and inherit their\nproperties. Lucretius distinguishes properties that are inseparable\n(coniuncta, Greek\n\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b7\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1)\nfrom others that are accidental (eventa,\n\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1). Even time\nor facts about the past, like the Trojan war, do not have a\nstand-alone existence but are dependent on our world and will not\nsurvive it.\n1.483\u2013634: Atoms and their minimal parts\n\nThe case for atoms follows (483\u2013615). All perceptible bodies\nmust be compounds of body and void, but since destruction into nothing\nis impossible, there must be a limit to destruction, \u2018pure\nvoid\u2019 and \u2018voidless body\u2019. Compound bodies must be\nmade of minute, indestructible bodies, stress-tested over infinite\ntime. Lucretius does not use the Greek word atomos,\n\u2018uncut(able)\u2019, though Cicero had tried\nindividuum, preferring terms that denote their\ngenerative capacities, such primordia ,\u2018first\nthings\u2019, or corpora prima, \u2018first bodies\u2019.\nEpicurean atoms are not physically divisible, but they are\ntheoretically analyzable into multiples of minimal or\n\u2018partless\u2019 parts (615\u201334). A minimum unit must\nbe conceded to account for differences in size and shapes of atoms.\nThere must also be differences among atoms themselves, for if atoms\ncould be reduced to a standard minimum unit, no variety in generation\nwould be possible. In Lucretius, however, the discussion of minimal\nparts is much abridged (see also 2.478\u2013580; on atoms, Konstan\n2020; on minima, Verde 2013).\n1.635\u2013920: Rival theories of matter refuted\n\nFrom the positive case for atomism, Lucretius veers to a critique of\nthree rival theories of matter. Three Presocratic philosophers\nare put forward as representatives of these theories. First comes\nHeraclitus (635\u2013711), leader of the monists, advocate of the\nsingle element fire, with generation operating by rarefaction and\ncondensation. Empedocles is the champion of the four-element theorists\n(712\u2013829) and he generates all things by union and dissolution,\nand finally Anaxagoras, advocate of an indefinite pluralism, who\nposits an indefinite number of \u2018homoeomerous\u2019 or\n\u2018like-parted\u2019 stuffs (830\u2013920) which merely vary in\nlocal concentration. The section may have been imported from\nelsewhere. One can suspect an Epicurean and/or doxographic source\nat work, whether Epicurus himself (Sedley 1998) or a later one\n(Montarese 2012). The key point that Lucretius stresses is that only\natomism can accommodate change while keeping the first principles, the\natoms themselves, completely invariant.\n1.951\u20131118 Infinite universe and space; critique of geocentrism\n\nFollowing the simile of the honey and the wormwood (921\u201350),\nbook 1 concludes with a dizzying transition from microcosm to infinite\nuniverse (951\u20131051). Lucretius argues that void or space cannot\nbe bounded: there is always further to go in all directions. And if\nso, then body, as well as space, must be infinite, for without\ninfinite body, creation would run out of matter. (Lucretius here is\nrelying upon the Epicurean doctrine that up and down are\nuniversal, as he will explain in book 2.) The infinite universe was a\nlegacy from earlier atomists and had been subject to criticism from\nPlato and Aristotle, who argued that the world was finite and unique,\nwith earth at the center. This is why Lucretius adds a critique of\ngeocentric cosmology to his positive case for the infinite universe\n(1052\u20131113). \nBook 2\n\nBook 2 covers atomic motion, atomic shapes, and the emergent\nproperties of compounds\n2.62\u2013332: Atomic motion and the swerve (for this section, see Fowler 2002).\n\nLucretius resumes his exposition with atomic motion, offering the\nfamous scientific image of motes of dust in a sunbeam (simulacrum\net imago \u2018likeness and image\u2019 112) to illustrate\nceaseless atomic motion, within or outside of compounds. Atoms travel\nat a constant but unimaginably high speed, meeting no resistance in\nthe pure void. They are much faster even than particles of light\n\u2014fire being a compound\u2014 whose constitutive atoms pull and\npush one another, causing the particles to have a lower aggregate\nvelocity (150\u201364). Atomic rebounds merely redirect them, without\nloss of speed. There is a universal up and down, however, and the\nweight of atoms will lead them to fall through space, at uniform\natomic speed.\n\nIt is at this point that Lucretius introduces the doctrine of the\natomic swerve or clinamen, a minimal deviation by atoms from\ntheir straight course that occurs randomly, at no specific time or\nplace (216\u201393). The swerve, attributed to Epicurus in our\nsources but not attested in our surviving works, is brought in to\nanswer a narrow hypothetical problem: what would happen if atoms were\nall traveling downwards, like drops of rain? Since they travel at\nequal speed, they could never overtake each other, nor could they\nshift from their straight downward trajectory and collide, so that no\natomic compounds could ever get going. Lucretius maintains that a\nminimal deviation \u2013best imagined as a\none-minimum lane-shift on a highway, rather than a change in\ndirection, an offramp\u2013 must take place in order to ensure that\ncollisions (and eventually worlds?) can arise. The account as we have\nit (216\u201350) is already too brief. But now, quite surprisingly,\nLucretius links it to a second factor, voluntary action\n(251\u201393). Taking voluntary action as a self-evident fact, he\nasserts that it stands as second independent reason requiring a\nminimal swerve, lest volition be trapped within an infinite causal\nchain. The exact meaning of this section has been much debated.\nIndeterminism in ancient atomist theory cannot help but remind us of\nindeterminism in modern quantum physics, which has sometimes been\ninvoked to support psychological indeterminism, thereby inviting us to\ndo the same for Lucretius. Yet the apparent lack of recourse to the\nswerve in some substantial surviving sections of On nature\nbook 25, where Epicurus argues for human agency over causal\ndeterminism, leaves it unclear how widely Epicurus relied on the\nswerve. Some think a swerve is involved in every voluntary animal\naction; a more minimal view requires only that the swerve grant minds,\nthose most subtle of physical bodies, enough slack from the chain of\ncausation, over time, to develop an independent domain of agency\n(survey in Englert, 2020; on Epicurus against determinism, Kamtekar\n2021).\n\nLucretius returns to atomic motion to assert the permanence of matter\nand motion (308\u2013332). Atomic motion does not cease in bodies at\napparent rest, but in cosmic settings the atoms settle into regular\npatterns, presumably within compounds, producing regular properties.\nTo support this Lucretius uses the analogy of distant views: just as\nsheep pasturing on a hill are reduced, at a distance, to white dots on\na green background; similarly, the clamor and flashing armor of a\nlegion being drilled dies down, from a nearby mountain top, to a mere\ngleam on the plain.\n2.333\u2013729 Atomic shapes and their combinations.\n\nThere is a great variety of atomic shapes, with many small variations\n(333\u2013477). Like animals, atoms can be classed into types or\nspecies without also requiring that all individuals of the species be\ncompletely identical. These atomic types underlie the diversity, but\nalso the finite regularity, of phenomenal properties and sensations.\nFrom line 380 and following Lucretius offers examples of the\ncontrasting properties of various materials, but his inferences from\nthese perceptible properties to their microstructures is problematic\nif referred directly to atoms (Bailey 1947 vol. II p. 866) instead of\nto compounds or \u2018molecules\u2019. The number of atomic\ntypes or shapes, we next learn, is unimaginably large, but not\ninfinite, since the atoms are finite multiples of finite\nminima and all atoms are imperceptibly small; but there is no\nlimit to the number of atoms of each exact shape (478\u2013580).\n\nA fuller account of compounds is then promised by the announcement\nthat nothing perceptible consists of only one type of atom\n(581\u201388). Instead, however, Lucretius offers an allegorical\nimage of \u2018mother earth\u2019, the great repository of all\nstuffs, rendered through the image of the Asiatic goddess Cybele, the\nMagna Mater (2.598\u2013660). From the surviving final\nsections of On nature 14, where Epicurus criticizes Plato in\nthe Timaeus for reducing fire to a single pyramidal atomic\nshape, it does seem that Epicurus recognized the four elements as\n(the most?) basic types of atomic compounds (Wigodsky 2007). Lucretius\ndoes not delve into this, however, and stresses instead the complexity\nof visible bodies. Such variety and complexity do not threaten\nthe regularities of nature, since they all proceed from finite and\nfixed atomic shapes.\n2.730\u20131022 Properties of atoms and emergent properties of compounds\n\nThe next section completes the introduction of atoms by distinguishing\nbetween atoms, whose only inseparable properties are shape, size and\nweight, and the emergent properties of compounds. Atoms lack\ncolor (730\u2013841), heat, moisture or smell (842\u201364). As for\nsensation, it is also an emergent property of living things, and atoms\ndo not have it (865\u2013900). This somewhat alienating thought is\nthen capped with the grand and slightly less alienating poetic idea of\nthe cycle of life (991\u20131022, a recap of 2.569\u201380). We are\nall children of heaven and earth, since we grow from the elements and\ndie back into them; within our world, the emergence and then\ndisappearance of life are in constant balance, secured by the\nindestructibility of the atoms.\n2.1023\u20131174 Infinite Worlds.\n\nAs did book 1, book 2 ends with the infinite universe. This time the\ninfinite universe is the basis for arguing that there are other worlds\nthan ours; since space is infinite, we cannot be unique\n(1048\u201389). Worlds occur by chance, when the sufficient material\nconditions are met, without any need for gods (1090\u20131104). The\ngrowth and decay of worlds is not a metaphor, but closer to a\nbiological fact. Lucretius ends book 2 on the pessimistic note that\nour world is already in decay (1105\u201374; but contrast\n5.325\u201337 where it is said to be young).\nBook 3\n\nBook 3 is on the nature and mortality of soul, concluding with the\nfear of death.\n3.94\u2013416: the nature and structure of soul\n\nThe soul is a body and not a harmony of parts in tension; it\nis a biological part of the body, like an organ, which remains active\nwhen the body is at rest, but it is unable to survive separation from\nit (94\u2013135). Lucretius distinguishes two main parts of soul\n(136\u201376). The animus, roughly mind, is the controlling\npart and center of consciousness, located in the chest, the\nanima more like the nervous system, spread throughout the\nbody (on partition, Verde, 2020; broader background in von Staden\n2000). Both parts are bodily since they act and are acted upon. A more\ndetailed elemental analysis of the soul follows (177\u2013322): the\nanimus is made of fine and mobile particles. It is a\ncomposite of breath, heat, air plus a fourth finest and nameless\nstuff. The nameless stuff initiates movement, which imparts it to\nbreath, heat and air; these then move the body. They form a single\nbody or mixture, but with small variations among individuals. These\nelemental-humoral \u2018idiosyncrasies\u2019 run from excess fire (=\nprone to anger) to excess air (= too placid). Although these\nimperfections cannot be eradicated, they can be controlled with\ntraining. Mind and body cannot survive apart, but each will eventually\nbe dissolved into their constituent atoms (323\u2013416).\n3.417\u2013829: Thirty proofs of the mortality of soul\n\nLucretius offers an epic catalogue of thirty arguments for the\nmortality of soul, mostly turning upon the interdependency of soul and\nbody for life. Lines 425\u2013669 argue against post-mortem survival,\n670\u2013783 against pre-existence, while 784\u2013829 return to\nmore general considerations. These proofs seek to undermine older\ntraditional beliefs in the afterlife and underworld (Hades) or attack\nPlatonic reincarnation and the immortality of the soul. The final\nsection of the book shifts from the fact of death as the end of all\nsensation, to argue that death is not to be feared (see section\n6).\nBook 4\n\nBook 4 explains the activities of soul: perception, thought, dreams,\nand emotions\n4.26\u2013215: the existence and nature of the simulacra\n\nSimulacra (Greek eidola) are thin atomic films that\nare constantly emitted in all directions from all larger aggregates,\npreserving the structure or shape of the original object\n(26\u2013109). They are extremely fine, form spontaneously and\nswiftly, and travel at great speed.\n4.216\u2013822: sensation and thought.\n\nSight and related phenomena are treated first (216\u2013378). Vision\nis due to the multiple impacts of a stream of\nsimulacra, while other sensations are due to other\nkinds of effluences or direct contact. Lucretius examines a number of\nvisual puzzles to show that the eyes are never wrong, rather the mind\ngenerates false inferences. This leads to an Epicurean critique of\nskepticism and a defense of the infallibility of the senses\n(469\u2013521). Lucretius replies to the sceptic that reason cannot\nrefute the senses and any attempt to deny knowledge through the senses\nis self-defeating, the very concept of true and false being anchored\nin sense-experience. (522-721). The working of the other senses is\ndiscussed before turning to thought (722\u2013822). Mental visions\nand dreams are a sort of attenuated inner vision reliant on the impact\nof even finer simulacra directly onto the soul. These\nsimulacra are so abundant, at all times, that the mind can focus on\nany of them; even fantastical imaginings are real enough, since the\nimages, like clouds, are constantly forming and coalescing into all\nmanner of shapes.\n4.823\u20131057: Functions of the body and soul\n\nLucretius deals with a number of bodily functions, from nutrition to\nvoluntary motion, sleep and dreams, before transitioning to a more\ngeneral critique of erotic love (1058\u20131287). The transition is\nhandled by a pointed refutation of teleology aimed at the notion of\nbody parts as designed to serve a purpose (823\u201357). In all\ncases, Lucretius replies, their existence preceded their use. Unlike\nartefacts, which serve a purpose that already exists, for example,\ncups for drinking or beds for sleeping, sight was not designed before\nthere were eyes to see.\nBook 5\n\nBook 5 contains a cosmology, describes the origins of life and the\nhistory of civilization.\n5.91\u2013770: Our world\n\nOur world had a beginning and will have an end (91\u2013109). Before\nexpanding on each of these, Lucretius offers a refutation of\ncreationist accounts (110\u2013234). The gods do not dwell in the\nworld, nor did they make the world for man. Even supposing they did,\nawkward questions can be raised. What were the gods up to before they\nbuilt the world for us? Where did they get the scientific knowledge\nneeded to plan life? And so on. At 195\u2013234, Lucretius rejects\nthe idea that the world was designed for human use. In fact, the world\nis barely able to sustain us. Most of it cannot support agriculture\nand agriculture itself is hard work, with crops sometimes failing. Why\nare there so many beasts and pests? They seem to thrive even without\nhelp, while humans are completely helpless when born. Next the\nmortality of the world is inferred from the mortality of its component\nparts, the four elements, each of which is destructible\n(235\u2013415). Against the upholders of an eternal world, Lucretius\nasks: why does human history not reach further back than the Theban\nand Trojan wars?\n\nOur world did not arise through intelligence or design, but because,\nin the infinite universe, as atoms work out randomly all possible\ncombinations, at some point an accumulation of atoms of a suitable\nkind to form our world occurred (416\u2013508). The formation of the\nearth is followed with an account of the heavens (509\u2013771). In\nhis account of the nature and movements of the sun, moon and stars,\nLucretius has recourse to the Epicurean mode of \u2018multiple\nexplanations\u2019, to be used for phenomena where we cannot\ndetermine, among a number of possible explanations \u2013and\nexcluding divine causation\u2013 which one applies. In such cases we\nshould stay open to all of them. Of each we can be confident that,\neven if not the case in our world, it will be true in some other world\n(526\u201333 and also 6.703\u201311; on the background,\nEpicurus\u2019 Letter to Pythocles and Hankinson 2013).\n5.772\u20131457: Life on earth, early man, history of civilization\n\nLucretius returns to the early earth and the origins of life\n(772\u2013925). The account, marked throughout by the conspicuous\nabsence of gods or teleology, is one of the most detailed and\ninfluential in the ancient anti-creationist tradition. First, grasses\nand plants sprouted from the earth, who, as mother of all, produced\nanimals from wombs inside the earth and quasi-milk for those first\nanimals. That fertility was of brief duration, however. The key\nanalogy is the earth as a female animal. A limited amount of\nstill-occurring spontaneous generation, small insects from mud,\nunderwrites the legitimacy of the comparison, while the notion of a\nlimited period of fertility explains why large creatures were once\nproduced but are no more (795\u2013836). Lucretius allows for many\nearly defective creatures and semi-Darwinian false starts that died\noff because they were not viable, could not reproduce, or find\nadvantageous arrangements, as in domestic animals (878\u2013925).\nAlthough much of this non-teleological account owes an obvious debt to\nEmpedocles\u2019 zoogony, with its phase of random, monstrous\ncross-species combinations of limbs (Diels-Kranz B 57-61), Lucretius\ncorrects the earlier theory by arguing against even temporary\ncrossings of the species boundary (Schrijvers 1999, Campbell\n2003).\n\nEarly man was solitary, not social, and much sturdier\n(926\u20131010). Lucretius outlines the hardships of life before\nagriculture, fire, clothing, society or law or marriage, but balances\nthat with the absence of the many ills civilization has brought, such\nas warfare or the perils of navigation. This same balance runs through\nthe history of civilization that closes the book (1011\u20131457). As\nis now widely recognized, Lucretius is not a progressivist, nor does\nhe see humanity as fallen from a past Golden Age of innocent happiness\nand self-sufficiency. At each technological advance he points out the\ndrawbacks of the new stage. The advances are prompted by nature,\nwithout divine inventors, as mankind recognizes the usefulness of\nshelter, clothes, fire, marriage, friendship and family life, the last\nof which is framed in Epicurean ethical terms, justice as a social\ncontract (1011\u20131027). The origins of language are not due to a\nprimeval name-giver, but an innate human impulse to make sounds and\nthe posterior recognition of the utility of designating objects\nthrough sounds (1028\u201390). A similar story goes for fire and\ncooking (1091\u20131104), the foundation of cities and the rise of\nkings and property (1105\u201335), later replaced by laws and the\nfear of punishment (1136\u201360). After outlining the origins of\nbelief in the gods (1161\u20131240; see section 6), Lucretius\ncontinues with the arts of war, metals, weapons (including a weird\naccount of unsuccessful experiment of bulls, boars and lions trained\nfor war), clothing, agriculture, music, and simple rustic pleasures,\nleading to the final improvements in war and the arts. These accounts\nare mere reconstructions, since these origins are mostly unavailable\nto investigation, but even without offering multiple alternatives,\nLucretius must think it sufficient to provide for each discovery a\nplausible, non-divine origin.\nBook 6\n\nBook 6 explains meteorological and terrestrial phenomena\n\nIn keeping with the two-book pattern, book 6 describes the world in\naction, doing so by tackling successive meteorological and earthly\nphenomena often viewed in popular belief as divine manifestations. The\nmultiple explanations featured in this section can be matched from\ndoxographic sources, but the pattern of the book is shaped by\nLucretius. In each case there is an emphasis on destruction or the\nthreatening aspects of nature, building to the final account of the\nAthenian plague, all in responsion to Book 1\u2019s theme of birth\nand generation (Jope 1989). Lucretius reviews thunder and lightning\n(96\u2013422), waterspouts (451\u2013534) clouds and rain, before\npassing to terrestrial level with earthquakes (533\u2013607), mount\nAetna and volcanoes (639\u2013711), the pestilential fumes of lake\nAvernus (738\u2013839) and other strange springs and fountains. An\nextensive account of magnetism \u2013a special challenge for\natomism\u2013 comes next (6.906\u20131089), and then various\npestilences (1090\u20131137), followed by the gruesome case study of\nthe Athenian plague. Throughout Lucretius encourages an attitude of\ndemythologizing detachment before the uncanny or invisible, thanks to\nthe denial of divine causation and recognition of the \u2018finite\ncapacity\u2019, finita potestas, of all natural\nprocesses (6.64\u20135, cf. 1.76).]\n",
