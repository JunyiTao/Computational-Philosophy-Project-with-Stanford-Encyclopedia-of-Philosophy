    "main_text": "Main Debates || Manipulation of Behaviour\n2.2 Manipulation of Behaviour\n\nThe ethical issues of AI in surveillance go beyond the mere\naccumulation of data and direction of attention: They include\nthe use of information to manipulate behaviour, online and\noffline, in a way that undermines autonomous rational choice. Of\ncourse, efforts to manipulate behaviour are ancient, but they may gain\na new quality when they use AI systems. Given users\u2019 intense\ninteraction with data systems and the deep knowledge about individuals\nthis provides, they are vulnerable to \u201cnudges\u201d,\nmanipulation, and deception. With sufficient prior data, algorithms\ncan be used to target individuals or small groups with just the kind\nof input that is likely to influence these particular individuals. A\n\u2019nudge\u2018 changes the environment such that it influences\nbehaviour in a predictable way that is positive for the individual,\nbut easy and cheap to avoid (Thaler & Sunstein 2008). There is a\nslippery slope from here to paternalism and manipulation.\n\nMany advertisers, marketers, and online sellers will use any legal\nmeans at their disposal to maximise profit, including exploitation of\nbehavioural biases, deception, and addiction generation (Costa and\nHalpern 2019 [OIR]). Such manipulation is the business model in much\nof the gambling and gaming industries, but it is spreading, e.g., to\nlow-cost airlines. In interface design on web pages or in games, this\nmanipulation uses what is called \u201cdark patterns\u201d (Mathur\net al. 2019). At this moment, gambling and the sale of addictive\nsubstances are highly regulated, but online manipulation and addiction\nare not\u2014even though manipulation of online behaviour is becoming\na core business model of the Internet.\n\nFurthermore, social media is now the prime location for political\npropaganda. This influence can be used to steer voting behaviour, as\nin the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica \u201cscandal\u201d (Woolley and\nHoward 2017; Bradshaw, Neudert, and Howard 2019) and\u2014if\nsuccessful\u2014it may harm the autonomy of individuals (Susser,\nRoessler, and Nissenbaum 2019).\n\nImproved AI \u201cfaking\u201d technologies make what once was\nreliable evidence into unreliable evidence\u2014this has already\nhappened to digital photos, sound recordings, and video. It will soon\nbe quite easy to create (rather than alter) \u201cdeep fake\u201d\ntext, photos, and video material with any desired content. Soon,\nsophisticated real-time interaction with persons over text, phone, or\nvideo will be faked, too. So we cannot trust digital interactions\nwhile we are at the same time increasingly dependent on such\ninteractions.\n\nOne more specific issue is that machine learning techniques in AI rely\non training with vast amounts of data. This means there will often be\na trade-off between privacy and rights to data vs. technical quality\nof the product. This influences the consequentialist evaluation of\nprivacy-violating practices.\n\nThe policy in this field has its ups and downs: Civil liberties and\nthe protection of individual rights are under intense pressure from\nbusinesses\u2019 lobbying, secret services, and other state agencies\nthat depend on surveillance. Privacy protection has diminished\nmassively compared to the pre-digital age when communication was based\non letters, analogue telephone communications, and personal\nconversation and when surveillance operated under significant legal\nconstraints.\n\nWhile the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU)\n2016/679) has strengthened privacy protection, the US and China prefer\ngrowth with less regulation (Thompson and Bremmer 2018), likely in the\nhope that this provides a competitive advantage. It is clear that\nstate and business actors have increased their ability to invade\nprivacy and manipulate people with the help of AI technology and will\ncontinue to do so to further their particular interests\u2014unless\nreined in by policy in the interest of general society.\n",
