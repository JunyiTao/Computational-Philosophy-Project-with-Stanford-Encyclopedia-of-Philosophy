    "main_text": "Recent Work in Analytic Philosophical Theology || Sin, Original Sin, and the Fall\n2.4 Sin, Original Sin, and the Fall\n\nThe doctrine of sin and the doctrine of atonement are correlative in\nthe same way that a disease and its remedy are correlative. If sin is\nthat from which Christ saves us, then the strength of the remedy\n(atonement) must vary according the severity of the disease (sin). As\na first approximation, a sinful act can be thought of as a morally bad\nact for which the sinner is responsible. But the language of\n\u201csin\u201d adds something to the language of moral wrongdoing:\na sin is a failure or fault with respect to God. Like other Christian\ndoctrines, the doctrine of sin poses tricky philosophical problems. To\nsee those problems more clearly, it is useful to disambiguate the\ndoctrine of sin into several distinct components: the first sin, the\nFall, original sin, and personal sin.\n\nFor extended discussion, see the entry\n sin in Christian thought.\n2.4.1 The First Sin\n\nThe problem of the first sin is the problem of how the very first\nsinful act is even possible, given various Christian axioms about the\ngoodness and creative power of God, and various philosophical\nassumptions about the nature of freedom and moral responsibility. The\nproblem of the first sin is sometimes treated as a question about the\nfall of Satan. It turns out to be surprisingly difficult to explain\nhow Satan\u2014by hypothesis, an angel created by God with a rational\nintellect, an upright will, and wholly good desires and\ndispositions\u2014could ever make the sinful choice to reject God.\nAugustine (City of God, Book 12), Anselm (\u201cOn the Fall\nof the Devil\u201d De casu diaboli), and Duns Scotus\n(Ordinatio 2, dist. 6, q. 2 ) all wrestle with this problem.\nContemporary philosophers who try to improve on their efforts include\nBarnwell (2009, 2017), MacDonald (1999), Rogers (2008), and Timpe\n(2012). Their responses all seek to explain how Satan\u2019s choice\nis metaphysically possible, by appealing to their own favored accounts\nof human freedom and conscious attention. Wood (2016) further\ndistinguishes between the \u201chard problem\u201d of how\nSatan\u2019s sinful choice is metaphysically possible, and the\n\u201charder problem\u201d of how it can be subjectively\nrational\u2014rational from the point of view of Satan himself.\n2.4.2 The Fall of Adam and Eve\n\nThe biblical story of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3) recounts the story of\nthe first human sin and its consequences. The traditional story of the\nfall of Adam and Eve does not seem consistent with either an\nevolutionary account of human origins or what we know about human\nhistory more generally. On some understandings, questions about the\nhistoricity of the Fall are not properly philosophical\nquestions at all. Yet it does seem like a properly philosophical task\nto articulate a doctrine of the fall that is both internally\nconsistent and consistent with other things we know to be true.\nMoreover, the doctrine of the Fall is conceptually connected to other\naspects of the doctrine of sin as well as to the doctrine of\nsalvation.\n\nPeter van Inwagen presents an account of the Fall that maintains many\nof its most important elements and, he claims, is consistent with\nevolutionary theory. Importantly, van Inwagen does not assert that\nthis account is true, but only \u201ctrue for all we know\u201d\n(2004). In a similar vein, Hud Hudson (2014) offers an ingenious\ndefense of a literal reading of the Genesis account that appeals to\ncontemporary \u201cgrowing block\u201d theories of time. Despite\ninitial impressions, neither van Inwagen nor Hudson are really\nconcerned with defending quasi-literal readings of Genesis. Instead,\nthey want to show that objections to those readings presuppose highly\ncontestable philosophical\u2014rather than empirical or\nscientific\u2014assumptions.\n2.4.3 Original Sin\n\nIn Christian theology, \u201coriginal sin\u201d in the strictest\nsense refers to the human condition after the Fall and not to the\nfirst human sin itself. The fall is the cause of the condition of\noriginal sin: because of Adam and Eve\u2019s sin, subsequent human\nbeings somehow \u201cinherit\u201d a disposition toward sin and an\nattraction toward evil that makes it inevitable that they will sin. On\nsome stronger interpretations, all subsequent human beings are also\njustly regarded as guilty by God from birth, even before they have\nsinned themselves. Even apart from worries about the historicity of\nthe fall, the philosophical challenges posed by this doctrine are\nobvious. How can people living now be morally responsible for the sins\nof the first human beings? What is the mechanism by which sin and\nguilt are \u201cinherited\u201d from past generations? If it is\ninevitable that all human beings will sin, can God justly punish\nthem?\n\nSome Christian philosophers have simply rejected the stronger versions\nof the doctrine of original sin as incoherent. Swinburne, for\ninstance, denies that all human beings are born guilty as a result of\nthe sin of their first parents and argues that the condition of\noriginal sin only makes it very likely, rather than inevitable, that\nthey will sin themselves (1989: 141\u201343). Other philosophers have\nattempted to show that even a strong doctrine of original sin can be\nphilosophically coherent, given the right metaphysical framework.\nMichael Rea, for instance, draws on fission theory and the metaphysics\nof temporal parts to suggest a way that contemporary humans might bear\nresponsibility for the sin of Adam by virtue of being counterparts or\nstages of Adam himself (2007). He also argues that a Molinist-inspired\ndoctrine of \u201ctransworld depravity\u201d might accomplish much\nof what Christians want from the traditional doctrine of original sin\n(2007). John Mullen (2007) also constructs a Molinist account of\noriginal sin and inherited guilt. On Molinism, God knows all the true\ncounterfactuals of creaturely freedom, which means that God knows\nevery free choice that every human being would make in every possible\nsituation. According to Mullen, if it were true that every free\ncreature would sin in an ideal, garden of Eden situation, then God\ncould justly punish them in the actual world for what they would have\ndone in that counterfactual world.\n2.4.4 Personal Sin\n\n\u201cPersonal sin\u201d refers to individual sinful acts. Because\nthe philosophical problems associated with personal sin initially seem\nvery similar to the problems associated with moral wrongdoing, there\nhas been comparatively little philosophical work on personal sin.\nStill, important definitional questions remain about exactly how, if\nat all, sin should be distinguished from moral wrongdoing, whether\nthere are sinful actions that are not immoral actions, and,\nconversely, whether there are immoral actions that are not sinful\n(Mitchell 1984; Dalferth 1984; Adams 1991; Couenhoven 2009).\n2.5 Other Topics\n\nThere are philosophical questions raised by nearly all Christian\ndoctrines and practices, and so there are many fertile areas of\ninquiry that still remain comparatively underexplored. This brief\nsurvey has focused on the most widely treated areas of analytic\nphilosophical theology. But some of the most creative work has\nbranched out into other domains including the Eucharist (Arcadi 2018;\nPickup 2015); liturgy, ritual, and worship (Cuneo 2016); bodily\nresurrection and personal identity (van Inwagen 1978; Merricks 1999;\nZimmerman 1999; Rudder Baker 2001); heaven (Walls 2002; Ribeiro 2011),\nhell (Walls 1992; Adams 1993; Kvanvig 1993; Sider 2002; Buckareff\n& Plug 2005) and purgatory (Walls 2011; Dumsday 2014).\n2.6 The Rise of \u201cAnalytic Theology\u201d\n\nIn 2009 Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea published their edited volume\nAnalytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology.\nThe volume\u2019s contributors collectively try to make the case that\nanalytic philosophy offers a valuable and neglected resource for\nChristian theologians. A new research program developed in its wake,\nand the ensuing years have seen the rise of a self-identified school\nof \u201canalytic theologians\u201d, who use the tools and methods\nof analytic philosophy to address Christian theological topics.\n\nAt present, it is not clear whether there is any meaningful difference\nbetween Christian \u201canalytic theology\u201d and Christian\n\u201cphilosophical theology\u201d, which has been treated as a kind\nof philosophy. As the discussion above indicates, analytic\nphilosophical theology has been produced largely by Christian\nphilosophers working in philosophy departments, rather than by\ntheologians in departments of theology or divinity schools. Classic\nworks of philosophical theology like Swinburne (1994) and Adams (2000)\nseem like analytic theology avant la lettre, for example, and\nmuch recent work called \u201canalytic theology\u201d seems quite\nsimilar to previous work called \u201cphilosophical theology\u201d\nor even \u201cphilosophy of religion\u201d (e.g., Mullins 2016). Yet\nsome self-described analytic theologians have also insisted that\nChristian analytic theology is really a form of theology\n(Torrance [Alan] 2013; Torrance [Andrew] 2019; Crisp, Arcadi, &\nWessling 2019). They emphasize that Christian analytic theology is an\ninternal project of faith seeking understanding that, as theology,\nholds itself accountable to scripture and Church tradition. Yet\nwhether Christian analytic theology is properly regarded as a kind of\nphilosophy or a kind of theology depends on how we draw the underlying\ndistinction between philosophy and theology\u2014if indeed we draw\nsuch a distinction at all.\n3. Philosophy of Religion, Philosophical Theology, Christian Theology: Is There A Difference and Does it Matter?\n\nIt might seem odd that analytic philosophy of religion (APR) includes\nexplicitly Christian philosophical theology of the sort discussed in\n Section 2.\n Yet most philosophers of religion working in the analytic tradition\nare Christian theists (Bourget & Chalmers 2014; De Cruz 2017).\nThey avowedly want to explore their faith using analytic philosophical\ntools, and see no problem in calling their work Christian philosophy,\nphilosophical theology, or more recently, \u201canalytic\ntheology\u201d. Of course, philosophy of religion as such is broader\nthan APR, and APR is broader than Christian APR. There are\nphilosophers of religion whose work is analytic but not Christian\n(e.g., Lebens 2020; Mizrahi 2020; Steinhart 2020; Oppy 2018;\nSchellenberg 2018; Draper 2019), Christian but not analytic (e.g.,\nWestphal 2001; Pattison 2011), and neither analytic nor Christian\n(e.g., Hammerschlag 2016; Burley 2016). Even so, the predominance of\nChristian philosophical theology\u2014or \u201cPlantinga-style\nChristian philosophy\u201d (Schellenberg 2018)\u2014within APR has\nrecently reopened some contentious debates about the proper\nrelationship between philosophy and Christian theology.\n\nThese debates can be grouped around two different\u2014and\nopposing\u2014lines of criticism. According to the first line, much\nAPR is too Christian and too theological: not really philosophy at\nall, but a thinly-disguised form of Christian theology\u2014perhaps\neven a form of apologetics (Levine 2000; Knepper 2013: 9; Draper 2019:\n2). Conversely, according to the second line, advanced by prominent\ntheologians, APR is neither fully Christian nor fully theological. On\nthis line of criticism, APR does not really wrestle with the\ntranscendent God of Christian faith, but tends to construct and\nexamine its own false \u201cGod of the philosophers\u201d (Milbank\n2009; Hart 2013; Oliver 2010; see also Harris & Insole 2005, 17).\nAlthough mutually opposing, both lines of criticism raise an important\nmethodological question: how\u2014if at all\u2014should we\ndistinguish philosophy about Christian topics from Christian theology?\n Section 1\n (above) surveyed important responses to this question in the history\nof Christian thought. This section addresses the question in the\ncontext of contemporary challenges to analytic philosophy of\nreligion.\n3.1 Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Too Theological?\n\nThe charge that APR is \u201ctoo theological\u201d can be\ndisambiguated into two distinct worries. The first worry concerns the\nscope of APR when considered as a whole: APR is too narrow,\nbecause it focuses excessively on Christian theological topics, to the\nexclusion of other equally important matters. The second worry\nconcerns the sources and methods of Christian APR\nspecifically: the sources and methods of Christian APR belong more\nproperly to theology than to philosophy.\n3.1.1 Narrowness of Scope?\n\nThe charge that APR as a discipline is \u201ctoo Christian\u201d or\n\u201ctoo theological\u201d could be understood as a worry about its\nscope: perhaps APR focuses too much on Christian theological topics,\nor at least on versions of monotheism that are compatible with\nChristianity, and is therefore too narrow in scope. Critics who\nadvance the narrowness worry include Trakakis 2008, Wildman 2010,\nKnepper 2013, Schilbrack 2014, Lewis 2015, Jones 2019, Draper 2019,\nTimpe & Hereth 2019, Mizrahi 2020. Although the narrowness worry\nhas wide currency, it is not always clear how to understand it as a\nproperly philosophical criticism. This problem is exacerbated by the\nfact that the narrowness worry is more often aimed at the field of APR\nas a whole, rather than at individual instances of APR. After all, the\ngeneral claim that APR is \u201ctoo Christian\u201d does not entail\nthat any specific argument of any specific philosopher is unsound.\nSimilarly, even if it is true that APR as a whole should be\n\u201cless Christian\u201d, it is hard to see why that fact would\nrequire any individual philosopher to change her research and teaching\nfocus (Schilbrack 2014: 12).\n\nStill, some versions of the narrowness worry are more philosophical\nthan others. According to more philosophical versions, Christian APR\nfrequently fails as philosophy: as a result of their\nChristian-theological biases, analytic philosophers of religion\ninadvertently make bad arguments. On this line, Christian analytic\nphilosophers are especially likely to engage in motivated reasoning\nand ignore counter-arguments or alternative points of view drawn from\nother religious traditions. Because APR is so narrow, Christian\nphilosophers unwittingly work in an echo-chamber or an epistemic\nbubble (Schilbrack 2014: 14; Draper 2019: 5; De Cruz 2020). As a\nresult, according to critics, the conclusions of their putatively\nphilosophical arguments are often unwarranted for anyone outside the\nChristian community, even when they purport to be generally\nprobative.\n\nLess philosophical versions of the narrowness worry assert the general\nprinciple that APR should be more capacious, and should include more\nnon-Christian voices, without explicitly challenging the soundness of\nspecific analytic arguments (Knepper 2013; Carroll 2016; Mizrahi\n2020). Here the worry is simply that APR does not\u2014but\nshould\u2014reflect the diversity of religious and non-religious\nviewpoints that actually obtain in the world. Phrased differently, APR\nas a field wrongly excludes too much good philosophical work that just\nhappens not to fit into the dominant Christian, monotheistic paradigm.\nYet one can hold this view without also agreeing that existing APR\nfails on its own terms or that any specific philosophers should alter\ntheir practices.\n3.1.2 Inappropriate Methods?\n\nThe charge that APR is too theological could also be understood as a\nquestion about philosophical methodology. On this version of the\ncharge, Christian APR does not begin from generally accessible\nassumptions and argue toward generally acceptable conclusions, as good\nphilosophy should. Instead, it typically begins from Christian\nassumptions and argues toward Christian conclusions, like\ntheology.\n\nJ.L. Schellenberg, for example, argues that philosophy must seek\nsolutions to philosophical problems that are in principle\n\u201cshareable\u201d by any member of the philosophical community.\nBecause much Christian APR assumes the truth of Christianity, its\nsolutions cannot satisfy this condition, and should properly count as\ntheology rather than philosophy (Schellenberg 2018). J. Aaron Simmons\nagrees: even though theology \u201ccan and should\u201d appeal to\nevidence restricted to \u201cdeterminate communities defined by\nrevelational authorities\u201d, philosophy should appeal to\n\u201cevidence that is, in principle, accessible by all members of\nthe philosophical community\u201d (2019: 147). According to Simmons,\nthe dominant strand of APR has ignored this criterion, and threatens\nto \u201cbecome simply a subset of Christian theological\npractice\u201d (2019: 149; see also Oppy 2018; Draper 2019: 2).\n3.1.3 Responses to the Worry that APR is \u201cToo Theological\u201d\n\nAnalytic philosophers of religion have a variety of ways to respond to\nthe charge that APR is too theological. First, with respect to the\nnarrowness charge, they can accuse critics of mistaking the part for\nthe whole, by denying that the charge applies to APR as such, and by\npointing to those analytic philosophers of religion who neither assume\nnor defend the truth of Christianity. Yet this response is undercut by\nthe fact that non-Christian practitioners of APR often make the\nnarrowness themselves (Schellenberg 2018; Oppy 2018; Draper 2019).\nSecond, its defenders also emphasize that much Christian APR does not\nactually assume the truth of Christianity at all, but instead\nargues for that truth. (Hasker 2018a: 90; citing Swinburne is\na paradigmatic example). This kind of philosophy would clear even\nSchellenberg\u2019s \u201cshareable in principle\u201d bar.\nSimilarly, even those philosophical projects that eschew\nSwinburne-style natural theology might still clear the \u201csharable\nin principle\u201d bar so long as they engage only in defensive\nmaneuvers\u2014for example, by answering philosophical objections to\nthe plausibility of Christian claims (e.g., van Inwagen 1995; Pawl\n2014).\n\nOthers argue that even explicit appeals to Christian revelation could\nin principle still count as philosophical appeals, albeit indirectly.\nSuppose we agree that theology can appeal to revelation, while\nphilosophy trades only in \u201cgenerally accessible\u201d\narguments. We still must distinguish between direct, first-order\nappeals to revelation, and indirect, second-order arguments that it is\nsometimes permissible to appeal to revelation (Wood 2021:\n213\u2013215). The second-order arguments could still be generally\naccessible philosophical arguments, even though the first-order\nappeals are not. For example, a first-order \u201ctheological\u201d\nappeal might be: \u201cThe New Testament asserts p;\ntherefore p\u201d. But a philosopher might offer a general\nepistemological argument, accessible to anyone in the philosophical\ncommunity, to defend the rationality of that same first-order appeal.\n(For example, she might offer a general argument that it is rational\nto form beliefs based on testimony, and the same general argument\nmight establish that it is rational to treat the New Testament as\ntestimonial evidence.) In a similar vein, Plantinga\u2019s claim that\nbelief in God may be \u201cproperly basic\u201d is not itself\npresented as a Christian assumption or a revealed truth, but as a\nspecific application of his general philosophical theory of warrant,\nwhich he has defended at length (1983, 1993a, 1993b).\n\nFinally, because there is no single uncontested way to understand the\nboundaries between philosophy and theology, it is open to Christian\nphilosophers of religion simply to deny the sharp distinction\npresupposed by critics like Schellenberg and Simmons (see, for\nexample, Plantinga 1984, Wolterstorff 2009). In so doing, they would\nimplicitly endorse a more Patristic \u201cIntegration\u201d model\ninstead of either the Medieval \u201cCooperation\u201d model or the\nmodern \u201cDisjunction\u201d model (see\n Section 2\n above).\n3.2 Or Not Theological Enough? Theological Critiques of Analytic Philosophy of Religion\n\nWhile one set of critics accuse APR of becoming too theological,\nanother set takes the opposite line. According to several prominent\ntheologians and philosophers, something about the analytic style of\nphilosophizing makes APR particularly unsuitable for investigating\nChristian doctrines. On this line of criticism, far from becoming a\nspecies of Christian theology, APR is constitutively opposed to\nChristian theology, and the problem with analytic philosophical\ntheology is not that it is too theological but that it is too\nanalytic. This criticism takes several forms.\n\nSometimes, theological objections to APR simply reiterate Barthian\nobjections to natural theology, presumably on the assumption that most\nAPR is really a form of natural theology (Moore 2007). Other critics\ncharge analytic philosophers of religion with historical anachronism\nand ignorance of the Christian tradition. Perhaps\n\u201ca-historical\u201d analytic philosophers of religion do not\nunderstand pre-modern ways of thinking and reading (so runs the\ncharge), and so they wrongly believe that their own constructive work\nis congruent with the historic Christian tradition, when it in fact\ndepends modern assumptions that are inimical to the Christian\ntradition (Hart 2013: 123, 129; Milbank 2009: 320). Other critics\npress the related worry that APR ignores the real Christian tradition\naltogether in favor of theorizing its own abstract, self-constructed\nversion of the Christian god. Here APR\n\n\ndoes not deal with the God of any tradition or encounter, but with a\nconceptual construct, a simulacrum or \u2018the God of the\nphilosophers\u2019\u2026. (Oliver 2010: 467\u2013468; see also\nHyman 2010)\n\n\nAnother multi-faceted line of theological criticism criticizes APR for\n\u201cidolatry\u201d, \u201cunivocity\u201d, and\n\u201contotheology\u201d. This line reflects the general worry that\nAPR does not take divine mystery or transcendence seriously enough.\n\u201cOntotheology\u201d is a theological term of opprobrium that,\nin its current usage, derives from Heidegger (1957; see also Marion\n1982 [1995]). It means, roughly, treating God like \u201ca\nbeing\u201d or \u201ca thing in the world\u201d. According to its\ntheological critics, APR constitutively assumes that God is a possible\nobject of human knowledge, even apart from revelation, and therefore\ntreats God as fundamentally similar to any other object \u201cout\nthere\u201d passively waiting to be discovered. Yet a God like this\n(so runs the worry) is not really God at all, but something\nelse\u2014an idol.\n\nThe worry about ontotheology and idolatry is also a worry about\nunivocity\u2014the view that our terms bear the same meaning when\napplied to God and creatures (Trakakis 2010). According to opponents\nof theological univocity, precisely because God is not \u201ca\nbeing\u201d or a \u201cthing in the world\u201d, God and creatures\ndiffer absolutely; they share no properties and so cannot be described\nby univocal predications. (So, e.g., the word \u201cgood\u201d\ncannot have the same meaning in the statements \u201cGod is\ngood\u201d, and \u201cSocrates is good\u201d.) Worries about\ntheological predication and univocity date back to the Patristic\nperiod, but in contemporary philosophy of religion, they are best\nunderstood as continuations of the late medieval disputes between\nfollowers of Duns Scotus, who defends univocal predication, and his\nThomist opponents (T. Williams 2005; Burrell 2008; Cross 2008). As a\ngeneralization, most contemporary analytic philosophers of religion\nendorse a univocal account of theological language, whereas\ncontemporary Christian theologians are more likely to deny univocity\nin favor of analogical or metaphorical predication, or even\nnon-predicative forms of theological language (Pickstock 2005; Marion\n1999).\n\nNotwithstanding the sharp rhetoric, there has been very little direct\nengagement between analytic philosophers of religion and their\ntheological opponents on these questions. T. Williams (2005), Cross\n(2008) defend univocal predication, and Adams (2014) tries to\nrehabilitate ontotheology. Other analytic thinkers offer their own\npositive accounts of divine transcendence (Crisp and Rea [eds.] 2009:\n9\u201311; Rea 2015, 2020; Jacobs 2015). More generally, analytic\nphilosophers and theologians have a variety of strategies for avoiding\nthe deleterious consequences of univocity and ontotheology (Wood 2021:\n130\u201374). ",
