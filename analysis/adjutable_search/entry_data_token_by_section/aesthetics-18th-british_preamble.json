    "main_text": "\n\n18th-century British aesthetics addressed itself to a\nvariety of questions: What is taste? What is beauty? Is there is a\nstandard of taste and of beauty? What is the relation between the\nbeauty of nature and that of artistic representation? What is the\nrelation between one fine art and another? How ought the fine arts be\nranked one against another? What is the nature of the sublime and\nought it be ranked with the beautiful? What is the nature of genius\nand what is its relation to taste?\n\nAlthough none of these questions was peripheral to\n18th-century British aesthetics, not all were equally\ncentral. The question on which the others tended to turn was the\nquestion concerning the nature of taste. But this question was not\nsimply how best generally to define taste. Everyone seems to have been\nin at least rough agreement with Joseph Addison\u2019s early\ndefinition of taste as \u201cthat faculty of soul, which discerns the\nbeauties of an author with pleasure, and the imperfections with\ndislike\u201d (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 409). But agreeing with\nAddison meant agreeing only to use \u201ctaste\u201d to refer to\nthat faculty and to acknowledge that such discerning has something of\nthe phenomenology of sensation. The central question was how to think\nof taste so defined. Is taste a higher, cognitive faculty, akin\nperhaps to reason, with objects of a primarily intellectual nature? Or\nis it a lower, bodily faculty, more akin to the five bodily senses,\nand with objects of a primarily material nature? The major theories\nthat arose in response to this question can be grouped into three main\nlineages: (a) internal-sense theories, of which the theories of\nShaftesbury (1711), Hutcheson (1725), Hume (1739\u201340, 1751, and\n1757) and Reid (1785) are representative; (b) imagination theories, of\nwhich theories of Addison (1712) and Burke (1757/59) are\nrepresentative; and (c) association theories, of which the theories of\nGerard (1757) and Alison (1790) are representative.\n",
