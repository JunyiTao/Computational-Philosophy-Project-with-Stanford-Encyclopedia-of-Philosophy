Integrated HPS and Historical Epistemology: What Good Are They Regarding Scientific Rationality?\n\nThe attempt to integrate historiography and philosophy of science has\na troubled history. Several joint departments and programs were formed\nin the heady 1960s, just as much historiography of science was turning\naway from internalist approaches. As professional historians and\nphilosophers came to realize that their interests differed, many of\nthese programs did wither.\n\nIn the meantime, several philosophers have engaged in serious\ninternalist studies for philosophical purposes, usually focusing on\n\u201cbig names\u201d such as Galileo, Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin,\nand Einstein, or big developments such as the route to the double\nhelix. More recently, scholars such as Nancy Nersessian with her\n\u201ccognitive history\u201d project (1995) have employed new\nresources from the cognitive sciences in this regard, a move neglected\nby Kuhn himself and resisted by sociologists concerned by the\nphilosophers\u2019 neglect of the social basis of the knowledge\nenterprise. (See also Giere 1988; Bechtel & Richardson 1993;\nDarden 2006; Andersen et al. 2006; Thagard, e.g., 2012.) Historians,\nmeanwhile, have focused on social history and, more recently, on\nsocial microhistory and lesser-known figures, including women, rather\nthan on the internalist moves of big-name scientists. Consequently,\nhistoricists today still feel the need to respond to Giere\u2019s\n(1973) question of whether history and philosophy of science can be an\nintimate marriage.\n\nSince 1990 promising new movements have emerged that bring together\nphilosophy of science and historiography of science. First,\nphilosophers of science became interested in the historical emergence\nand professionalization of their own field. Early work quickly\ndestroyed some myths about the Vienna Circle, for example. The primary\norganization here is the International Society for the History of\nPhilosophy of Science (HOPOS), with its own journal and regular\nmeetings. More recently, the Integrated History and Philosophy of\nScience (&HPS) organization has sponsored several conferences with\nthe goal of maintaining the standards of both fields rather than\ncompromising one for the supposed advantage of the other. (For\nbackground, see Schickore 2011, 2017. Consult the &HPS website for\nother contributors.)\n\nTheodore Arabatzis (forthcoming) distinguishes two ways of integrating\nhistory and philosophy of science: the familiar \u201chistorical\nphilosophy of science\u201d (HPS), usually based on\n\u201chistorical\u201d case studies; and the less familiar\n\u201cphilosophical history of science\u201d (PHS). It is well known\nthat historians have found most philosophical work of little use, and\nArabatzis aims to help correct the asymmetric relationship between\nhistory and philosophy.\n\n\n[P]hilosophical reflection on these concepts can be\nhistoriographically fruitful: it can elucidate historiographical\ncategories, justify historiographical choices and, thereby, enrich and\nimprove the stories that historians tell about past science as a\nknowledge-producing enterprise. \n\n\nLabels for movements can be arbitrary and misleading, but several of\nthe authors cited by Arabatzis have been identified with a movement\nusually called \u201chistorical epistemology\u201d, the goal of\nwhich is to combine excellent history of science with philosophical\nsophistication or excellent philosophy with more historical\nsophistication than is usually found in case-studies approaches. Given\nthe epistemological focus, here is where we might expect to find the\ngreater concentration of work relevant to questions of scientific\nrationality. The epicenter of the movement is the Max Planck Institute\nfor the History of Science in Berlin, whose directors over the years,\nLorenz Kr\u00fcger (who died before he could assume the post),\nLorraine Daston, Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger, and J\u00fcrgen Renn,\nhave promoted historical epistemology. A recent, special issue of\nErkenntnis (Sturm & Feest (eds.) 2011) on historical\nepistemology derives from a conference at the Institute. In their\nintroductory essay to the special issue, the co-editors, Uljana Feest\nand Thomas Sturm, ask \u201cWhat (Good) is Historical\nEpistemology?\u201d (Feest & Sturm 2011). The special issue\nincludes a baker\u2019s dozen authors who develop and/or critique\nvarious approaches to historical epistemology. The participants range\nfrom older hands such as Philip Kitcher, Michael Friedman, and Mary\nTiles to more recent contributors such as Jutta Schickore and\nFeest. (See Tiles & Tiles 1993 for an early philosophical\nintroduction to the field.)\n\nFeest & Sturm (2011) divide the movement into three streams. One stream\nstudies historical changes in epistemology-laden concepts\nsuch as objectivity, observation, evidence, experimentation,\nexplanation, and probability. How do new concepts emerge? How are they\nstabilized? At what point do they become conscious rather than\nremaining implicit in practice? How do they shift over time and how\nwell do they travel to different scientific contexts (cf. Howlett\n& Morgan 2011)? Insofar as they are initially metaphorical, how do\nthey become dead metaphors? How do they fade out of use? Lorraine\nDaston\u2019s work is a good example of this approach (e.g., 1988,\n1991; Daston & Galison 2007; Daston & Lunbeck 2011). This\nmeans looking at the evolution of concepts or organizing\n\u201ccategories\u201d of action and thought within a historically\nconfined project, however interdisciplinary it might\nbe\u2014something between the eternal, global, and maximal often\nfavored by philosophers and the evanescent, local, and contingent\nfavored by many historians. Gone is the old-fashioned\n\u201cconceptual history\u201d of the sort exemplified by Max\nJammer\u2019s (1957),\nwhich traces \u201cthe concept\u201d of force from ancient Egypt to\nthe twentieth century. Wrote Daston in an early paper:\n\n\nTo my mind, the most able practitioners of historical epistemology\nthese days are philosophers rather than historians\u2014I think of\nthe remarkable recent work of Ian Hacking and Arnold\nDavidson\u2014although I think they, intellectual historians, and\nhistorians of science might well make common cause in such a venture.\n(1991: 283, footnote omitted; see also Davidson 2002)\n\n\nDaston then asks, \u201cWhat good is historical epistemology?\u201d\nHer opening (but later qualified) suggestion is that it goes part way\ntoward \u201creleasing us from our bondage to the past by hauling\nthat past into conscious view\u201d, although we must recognize that\ncalling attention to the contingent origins of something is not\nsufficient to debunk it, upon pain of committing a genetic fallacy.\nNor can we simply reject something without having an alternative to\nput in its place. \u201cThat is, historicizing is not identical to\nrelativizing, much less to debunking\u201d.\n\nThe second strand of historical epistemology identified by Feest and\nSturm in their introduction to the special issue focuses on the trajectories of the objects of\nresearch\u2014\u201cepistemic things\u201d\u2014rather than on\nconcepts, and here the well-known work of Rheinberger (1997, [2006]\n2010a, [2007] 2010b) is emblematic. Renn (1995, 2004) represents the\nthird approach, an attempt to understand the longer-term dynamics of\nscience. For example, Renn attempts to solve several mysteries about\nhow Einstein was able to accomplish the relativity revolution. His\nanswer takes into account the long history of developments in distinct\nfields that Einstein was able to bring together, partly because of his\nwide philosophical and other cultural interests. Renn looks at\nlong-term developments by analogy with biological development. Norton\nWise (2011) also brings biological metaphor into play. He observes\nthat historical narrative as a form of explanation is now making\nserious incursions into physics, in the physics of complex or highly\nnonlinear systems.  \u201cCovering law\u201d explanations are not\navailable there, he says, and sometimes we must resort to simulations\nin order to understand how systems evolve. \u201cWe know what we can\ngrow\u201d.\n\nRunning through much historical epistemology is a century-long line of\nneo-Kantian thinking, from Ernst Cassirer and the Marburg school to\nReichenbach and Carnap and then to Kuhn, Ian Hacking, Michael\nFriedman, Daston, Renn, and others. Theirs are diverse versions of the\ntwo-process view introduced in\n Section 1.2\nabove. On this view, there are long-term socio-cognitive stabilities\n(not necessarily the paradigms or research programs discussed above)\nthat have a beginning, middle, and end in historical time. They are\nhistoricized Archimedean points or platforms that organize\nhuman experience, rather than fixed Kantian categories. But, like\nKant\u2019s categories, they are presuppositions that define how\ncoherent perception and the formation of true or false propositions\nare possible.\n\nFriedman speaks of these as \u201chistorically contingent but constitutive\na prioris\u201d. His 2011 takes first steps beyond the two-process\ndynamic of his 2001 to address the problem of changing conceptions of\nrationality (i.e., intersubjective objectivity) and to bring in a\nwider social dimension. Like Renn, Friedman makes philosophical\nreflection a key to understanding changes so rapid that they amount to\ndiscontinuities. Up to a point he defends Kuhn on the existence of\nscientific revolutions and incommensurability. Kuhn ran into trouble\nwith incommensurability and relativism, he says, for failing to\ninclude the history of scientific philosophical reflection\nthat parallels the first-order, technical scientific work itself.\nFriedman\u2019s leading example is also the relativity\nrevolution.\n\nWhy do philosophers need to appeal to serious history of science? From\nthe beginning, Friedman has answered this question by insisting on the\nimportance of the history of science to locate the emergence of\nphilosophical ideas in their historical scientific context and vice\nversa\u2014thus to understand the interaction between what\nis commonly called scientific work and philosophical work (Domski\n& Dickson 2010: 4). For example, Newton\u2019s mechanical system\nof the world was shaped by philosophical and theological interests\nthat Newton and his contemporaries considered directly relevant\n(internal not external), as well as socio-political interests. And\nlikewise for Kant and Poincar\u00e9 and Einstein and many other\nthinkers, great and small. To the degree that we retain an\ninternal/external distinction, it is historically relative. Unlike\nmost other historical philosophers, Friedman furnishes the intricate\ntechnical and contextual detail to support such claims.\n\nInspired by Friedman\u2019s approach is the rich collection,\nDiscourse on a New Method: Reinvigorating the Marriage of History\nand Philosophy of Science (2010), edited by Mary Domski and\nMichael Dickson, and containing a book-length response (Friedman\n2010). Their introduction to the volume is a \u201cmanifesto\u201d\nfor \u201csynthetic history\u201d (2010: 11ff, 572ff). This sense of\n\u2018synthetic\u2019 is not opposed to \u2018analytic\u2019, they\ninsist. For example, rather than separating out the mathematical,\nphysical, philosophical, theological and other social-contextual\nconstituents of Newton\u2019s work for separate disciplinary\ntreatment, synthetic history follows Friedman in exploring the ways\nthese relate to one another to achieve an outcome with a satisfying\nconvergence (2010: 15ff). Although inspired by Friedman\u2019s work,\nthe manifesto denies that Friedman\u2019s two-process view is\nessential to synthetic history. (See also the extensive discussion of\nFriedman by Menachem Fisch (forthcoming), a work centered on George\nPeacock\u2019s struggle with rational consistency that helped produce\na transformation in nineteenth-century mathematics.)\n\nA somewhat different sort of two-levels position is the\n\u201chistorical ontology\u201d of Ian Hacking. Hacking (2002, 2012)\ncites Foucault\u2019s \u201cdiscursive formations\u201d\n(epist\u00e8mes) and Alistair Crombie\u2019s \u201cstyles\nof scientific thinking\u201d (Crombie 1994) as inspirations. Examples\nof such styles are the Greek discovery or invention of axiomatic\ngeometry, the laboratory science that emerged in the Scientific\nRevolution (Shapin & Schaffer 1985), and modern probability theory\nand statistical inference (Hacking 1975). Hacking returns to\nKant\u2019s \u201chow possible?\u201d question, the answer to which\nestablishes the necessary conditions for a logical space of reasons in\nwhich practitioners can make true or false claims about objects and\npose research questions about them. And Hacking also historicizes the\nKantian conception.\n\n\nThe historical a priori points at conditions whose dominion\nis as inexorable, there and then, as Kant\u2019s synthetic a\npriori. Yet they are at the same time conditioned and formed in\nhistory, and can be uprooted by later, radical, historical\ntransformations. T.S. Kuhn\u2019s paradigms have some of the\ncharacter of a historical a priori. (Hacking 2002: 5)\n\n\u2026\n\n[S]cientific styles of thinking & doing are not good\nbecause they find out the truth. They have become part of our\nstandards for what it is, to find out the truth. They establish\ncriteria of truthfulness. \u2026 Scientific reason, as manifested in\nCrombie\u2019s six genres of inquiry, has no foundation. The styles\nare how we reason in the sciences. To say that these styles\nof thinking & doing are self-authenticating is to say that they\nare autonomous: they do not answer to some other, higher, or deeper,\nstandard of truth and reason than their own. To repeat: No foundation.\nThe style does not answer to some external canon of truth independent\nof itself. (2012: 605; Hacking\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nAs in early Kuhn, there is a kind of circularity here that is perhaps not\nvicious but, quite the contrary, bootstraps the whole enterprise.\nHacking describes changes in historical a prioris as\n\u201csignificant singularities during which the coordinates of\n\u2018scientific objectivity\u2019 are rearranged\u201d (2002:\n6).\n\nUnlike Kuhnian paradigms, several of Hacking\u2019s styles of\nthinking and doing can exist side by side, e.g., the laboratory and\nhypothetical modeling traditions. Yet people living before and after\nthe historical crystallization of a style would find each other\nmutually unintelligible. Hacking recognizes that Kuhnian problems of\nrelativism lurk in such positions. \u201cJust as statistical reasons\nhad no force for the Greeks, so one imagines a people for whom none of\nour reasons for belief have force\u201d (2002: 163). This sort of\nincommensurability is closer to Feyerabend\u2019s extreme cases (as\nin the ancient Greek astronomers versus their Homeric predecessors)\nthan to Kuhn\u2019s \u201cno common measure\u201d (2002: chap. 11).\nWrites Hacking,\n\n\nMany of the recent but already \u201cclassical\u201d philosophical\ndiscussions of such topics as incommensurability, indeterminacy of\ntranslation, and conceptual schemes seem to discuss truth where they\nought to be considering truth-or-falsehood. (2002: 160)\n\n\nFor an illuminating exposition and critique of Hacking\u2019s\nposition, see Kusch (2010, 2011).\n A still more integrative role for historical epistemology is\narticulated by Hasok Chang (2004, 2012). Chang is a nonrealist who\nboldly goes beyond the case-study genres of both philosophers and\nprofessional historians to propose what he terms \u201ccomplementary\nscience\u201d, a fully integrated historical and philosophical\napproach that does not stop with pointing out historical contingencies\nbut also investigates them scientifically, e.g., by repeating and\nextending historical experimental practices. Chang\u2019s idea is\nthat complementary science can preserve previously gained knowledge\nand unanswered questions now in danger of becoming lost, and can even\nbuild upon them as a complement to today\u2019s highly specialized\nscientific disciplines. The results can be published as genuine, if\nnon-mainstream, scientific contributions. For example, in his own work\nhe tries to bring the debate over phlogiston to life as well as that\nover the nature of water and the question of its boiling point. For\nhis work, Chang leaves both his armchair and the library, for he needs\nscientific equipment and laboratory space in addition to the usual\nscholarly materials.\n\nHistorical epistemology faces a variety of criticisms, including some\ninherited from the Battle of the Big Systems, e.g., whether\nrationality and objectivity can be locally preserved during major\ntransformations and how to have thoroughgoing historicity, including\nhistorical relativity, without full-blown relativism. Generalization\nproblems still lurk at the meso-scale of historical epistemology. Some\ncritics question whether historical epistemology is anything new,\nsometimes complaining that it just revives traditional history of\nideas. Some would question its neo-Kantian underpinnings. For example,\nhow can we really identify and individuate the\n\u201ccategories\u201d employed by scholars such as Hacking and\nDaston? (See Kusch 2010, 2011 and Sciortino 2017.) Skeptics ask what\ndifference historical epistemology makes to science, history, or\nphilosophy of science. Is it more than a faddish relabeling of work\nalready well underway? Are new historical and/or philosophical methods\nrequired to conduct such a study? Given its different strands, is it\ncoherent as a movement? Various adherents disagree on what it includes\nand even what to call it. Although Daston declares that\nHacking\u2019s work provided much of her original inspiration,\nHacking denies that he is doing historical epistemology, preferring\n\u201cmeta-epistemology\u201d. He also says that he is doing\nwhiggish \u201chistory of the present\u201d. Scholars such as\nNersessian, ABC (Andersen, Barker, & Chen 2006), and Renn rely\nheavily on recent work in cognitive science, whereas sociologists\nstill tend to shun cognitive psychology.\n\nHow significant can we expect historical epistemology to be in the\nlonger run? History will be the judge!\n",
