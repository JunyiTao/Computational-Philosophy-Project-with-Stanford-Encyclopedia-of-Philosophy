Contingent identity\n\nBefore Kripke\u2019s writings (1972 [1980]), it seemed a platitude\nthat statements of identity could be contingent \u2013 when they\ncontained two terms differing in sense but identical in reference and\nso were not analytic. Kripke challenged this platitude, though, of\ncourse, he did not reject the possibility of contingent statements of\nidentity. But he argued that when the terms flanking the sign of\nidentity were what he called rigid designators, an identity statement,\nif true at all, had to be necessarily true, but need not be knowable\na priori, as an analytic truth would be. Connectedly, Kripke\nargued that identity and distinctness were themselves necessary\nrelations: if an object is identical with itself it is necessarily so,\nand if it is distinct from another it is necessarily so.\n\nKripke\u2019s arguments were very persuasive, but there are examples\nthat suggest that his conclusion is too sweeping \u2013 that even\nidentity statements containing rigid designators can be, in a sense,\ncontingent. The debate over contingent identity is concerned with the\nassessment and proper analysis of these examples.\n\nOne of the earliest examples is provided by Gibbard (1975). Consider a\nstatue, Goliath, and the clay, Lumpl, from which it is composed.\nImagine that Lumpl and Goliath coincide in their spatiotemporal\nextent. It is tempting to conclude that they are identical. But they\nmight not have been. Goliath might have been rolled into a ball and\ndestroyed; Lumpl would have continued to exist. The two would have\nbeen distinct. Thus it seems that the identity of Lumpl and Goliath,\nif admitted, must be acknowledged as merely contingent.\n\nOne reaction to this argument available to the convinced Kripkean is\nsimply to deny that Lumpl and Goliath are identical. But to accept\nthis is to accept that purely material entities, like statues and\nlumps of clay, of admittedly identical material constitution at all\ntimes, may nonetheless be distinct, though distinguished only by\nmodal, dispositional or counterfactual properties. To many, however,\nthis seems highly implausible, which provides the strength of the\nargument for contingent identity. Another way of thinking of this\nmatter is in terms of the failure of the supervenience of the\nmacroscopic on the microscopic. If Lumpl is distinct from Goliath then\na far distant duplicate of Lumpl, Lumpl*, coincident with a statue\nGoliath*, though numerically distinct from Goliath will be\nmicroscopically indistinguishable from Goliath in\nall general respects, relational as well as non-relational,\npast and future as well as present, even modal and dispositional as\nwell as categorical, but will be macroscopically\ndistinguishable in general respects, since it will not be a statue,\nand will have modal properties, such as the capacity to survive\nradical deformation in shape, which no statue possesses.\n\nDavid Lewis (in \u201cCounterparts of Persons and their\nBodies\u201d, 1971) suggests that the identity of a person with his\nbody (assuming the person and the body, like Goliath and Lumpl, are at\nall times coincident) is contingent, since bodily interchange is a\npossibility. He appeals to counterpart theory, modified to allow a\nvariety of counterpart relations, to explain this. Contingent identity\nthen makes sense, since \u201cI and my body might not have been\nidentical\u201d now translates into counterpart theory as\n\u201cThere is a possible world, w, a unique personal\ncounterpart x in w of me and a unique bodily\ncounterpart y in w of my body, such that x\nand y are not identical\u201d.\n\nWhat is crucial to making sense of contingent identity is an\nacceptance that modal predicates are inconstant in denotation (that\nis, stand for different properties when attached to different singular\nterms or different quantifying expressions). Counterpart theory\nprovides one way of explaining this inconstancy, but is not\nnecessarily the only way (Gibbard 1975, Noonan 1991, 1993). However,\nwhether the examples of contingent identity in the literature are\npersuasive enough to make it reasonable to accept the certainly\ninitially surprising idea that modal predications are inconstant in\ndenotation is still a matter of considerable controversy.\n\nFinally, in this section, it is worth noting explicitly the\ninterdependence of the topics under discussion: only if the\npossibility of contingent identity is secured, by counterpart theory\nor some other account of de re modality which does not\nstraightforwardly analyse de re modal predication in terms of\nidentity across possible worlds, can perdurance theory (or stage\ntheory) as an account of identity across time be sustained against the\nmodal arguments of Wiggins, Thomson and van Inwagen.\n",
