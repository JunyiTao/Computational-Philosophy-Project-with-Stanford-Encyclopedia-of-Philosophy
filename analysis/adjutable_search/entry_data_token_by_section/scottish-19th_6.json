James McCosh (1811\u201394)\n\nDid Scottish Idealism constitute a revitalization and continuation of\nthe Scottish philosophical tradition, or its demise? James McCosh who\npublished The Scottish Philosophy, Biographical, Expository,\nCritical, from Hutcheson to Hamilton, in 1874 had no doubt.\nWriting from the distant perspective of Princeton he held that the\nScottish philosophy was now opposed within Scotland on two\nfronts\u2014by the materialism of Bain on the one hand, and on the\nother, by the Hegelianism of Caird (described by George Davie as\n\u201ca very untypical Scotsman and one quite exceptionally apathetic\nto educational customs of the country\u201d (Davie 1961 86)).\n\nMcCosh was in a good position to make this assessment. As a student at\nthe University of Glasgow he acquired a wide knowledge of the\ntradition (though this seems to have been due more to the library than\nthe lecture hall), and later while a divinity student at Edinburgh he\nattended Hamilton's lectures. Ordained to the ministry of the Church\nof Scotland in 1834, McCosh got caught up in the conflicts that\neventually led to the great Disruption of 1843, and split the national\nchurch for almost 100 years. Though he ministered faithfully for the\nFree church side, he also found time to continue with his\nphilosophical studies and in 1850 published The Method of the\nDivine Government, Physical and Moral, a work that eventually ran\nto thirteen editions. On the strength of this book, McCosh was offered\nthe Professorship of Logic and Metaphysics at the Queen's College\nBelfast, part of the newly created National University of Ireland.\nEighteen years later he accepted the Presidency of the College of New\nJersey (subsequently Princeton University) where he also taught moral\nphilosophy, even after his retirement from the Presidency in 1888.\n\nFor McCosh, the heart of \u2018the Scottish philosophy\u2019 lay in\nits combination of observational methods of inquiry with moral and\nreligious formation. \u201cEver since I became a teacher of the\nscience of mind\u201d he writes, \u201cI have given more attention\nto philosophy than theology. In doing this I have been able to serve\nreligion more effectively than any other course I could have\ntaken\u201d (McCosh 1896, 251). Given this account of what made the\nScottish philosophy distinctive, it is easy to see why McCosh thought\nthe philosophical schools becoming fashionable in Scotland signalled\nits demise. The materialism of Bain fastened on the former\n(observational methods) but abandoned the latter (moral formation),\nwhile the Idealism of Caird abandoned the former in the interests of\nthe latter.\n\nMcCosh's pessimism that the combination of Realism and Theism which\nunderlay the Scottish philosophical enterprise from Hutcheson to\nHamilton had foundered within the universities of Scotland, was offset\nby his hope and belief that the rising cultural and intellectual\nindependence of the United States from its European origins would\nconstitute fertile ground for a new \u2018American\u2019 philosophy\nthat would both continue and develop all that was best in the Scottish\ntradition. He proved to be quite wrong in this speculation. Two\nphilosophies rose to prominence in America. Both of them had some\nconnection with what came to be known a little later as the\n\u201ccollege philosophy\u201d that emanated from Scotland via\nPrinceton. One was a version of Idealism that was sympathetic to\ntheism, and the other Pragmatism, which owed something to Reidian\n\u2018Common Sense\u2019. Neither of them, however, was Realist, and\nboth were soon displaced by logical positivism.\n8. Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison (1856\u20131931)\n\nWhile McCosh regarded the division between empiricists like Bain, and\nIdealists such as Caird, to be largely exhaustive, he did leave open\nthe possibility of persisting with the insights and methods of\nScottish philosophy, and commended a few individuals in this respect,\namong them Robert Flint (1838\u20131910), who was Professor of Moral\nPhilosophy at St Andrews before moving to the Chair of Divinity at\nEdinburgh. McCosh's list is short, and does not include Andrew Seth.\nYet arguably it was Seth who, in a major work published some decades\nlater, proved to be the most articulate exponent of the Scottish\nphilosophical tradition, retaining the fundamentals of Scottish\nphilosophy in a highly sophisticated form.\n\nThough McCosh does not mention Seth, it is hard to believe that he did\nnot know of Seth's earlier lectures on Scottish philosophy since these\nappeared in print before McCosh had retired from the Presidency at\nPrinceton. In any event, there is an interesting historical connection\nbetween the two men. As President of the College of New Jersey,\nMcCosh's vision and energy laid the foundations for its transformation\nfrom a worthy regional institution to an internationally acknowledged\nleader in higher education. It was in 1896, two years after McCosh's\ndeath, that this remarkable transformation was finally acknowledged in\nthe change of name to Princeton University. Seth (by then Seth\nPringle-Pattison) was invited to attend the celebrations on behalf of\nthe University of Edinburgh, and gave two lectures on Theism.\n\nIt was twenty years later, however, before his magnum opus,\nThe Idea of God in the Light of Recent Philosophy appeared.\nThis book began life as Gifford Lectures delivered at the University\nof Aberdeen in the years 1912 and 1913. World War I (in which Seth's\nson Ronald fought and died) delayed both their revision and their\npublication. Consequently, they were not published until 1917. Lecture\nOne begins with David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural\nReligion, and taking that as his starting point, Seth proceeds to\naddress all the issues that had long dominated philosophical debate in\nScotland. These include the existence of God, the relation of mind to\nbody, the nature and scope of science, the theory of knowledge and the\nproblem of skepticism. The 'recent philosophy', to which the subtitle\nrefers, is the division and debate between empirical psychology and\nidealistic philosophy that had taken up competing sides on these\nquestions. The heart of Seth's strategy is to analyze the defects of\nof empiricism and Idealism, and then to seek an integration of the\ncompelling philosophical insights of both. He acknowledges that the\nScottish philosophical tradition is inherently naturalistic, while at\nthe same time accepting the Idealists rejection of Hume's narrow\nempiricism. In Lecture V of the first series, Seth accordingly\nelaborates and defends what he calls 'higher' naturalism. Three\nelements are key to this more sophisticated version of the naturalism\nthat united Hume and Reid. First, philosophy has to be grounded in\nexperience. It relies on both introspection and experiment, and cannot\nproceed satisfactorily in the form of rationalistic deductions from a\npriori principles. Second, dispassionately considered, we experience\ndifferent orders of mind. The mind of animals is different to the mind\nof human beings. In particular, the human mind exhibits moral\nconsciousness, something wholly lacking in other creatures. This is no\nless a fact of experience than anything biological observation or\nlaboratory experiments might reveal. Given these critical differences\nbetween the kinds of mind experienced in nature, it is a mistake to\nseek to bring all evolved creatures within the scope of a unitary\ncausal or biological explanation. Thirdly, the perennial task of\nphilosophy is to search for a comprehensive explanation of experience.\nPhilosophy's proper ambition is not to be a distinctive science, but\nto formulate an explanatory understanding that will integrate the\nradical differences within experience without eliminating them. Both\npsychologism and Idealism, whatever other merits they may have, fail\nin this respect.\n\nSeth's scope of reference, the subtlety of his arguments, his\nfamiliarity with the most recent advances in evolutionary biology and\nexperimental psychology make The Idea of God a remarkable\nwork. It represents a synthesis of profound learning that extended\nover almost half a century, from his days as a student until close to\nhis retirement as a Professor. In his retirement Seth published two\nmore substantial books, one of them a second set of Gifford Lectures,\nyet there is no doubt that The Idea of God is his finest\nwork, and a major philosophical accomplishment by any standard. Issued\nby Britain's most prestigious academic publisher, the Clarendon Press\nat Oxford University, the book was widely reviewed and highly\nacclaimed at the time of its publication. Yet it did not long retain\nthe attention it received at first, and subsequently sank into\nobscurity. In the last hundred years it has almost never been referred\nto. Given its merits, why should this be?\n\nMcCosh was correct in claiming that neither the empirical psychology\nof Bain, nor the Hegelian Idealism of Caird, was an adequate successor\nto the philosophical tradition to which, for the most part, they owed\ntheir origins. Nevertheless, both succeeded in attracting the talent\nand enthusiasm of a new generation of scholars, and they did so to\npowerful effect. Psychology became a hugely influential voice in the\nworld of intellectual inquiry, and alongside other social 'sciences'\nsuch as sociology, economics and political science, this seemed to\nvalidate a strictly empirical approach to the study of many of the\ntopics that had occupied the philosophers of the Scottish\nEnlightenment. As a result, all these new subjects, whose origins owed\nmuch to Scottish philosophy, grew in allegiance and prestige.\nInevitably, this development had a philosophical effect. The new\n'sciences' gave greater credibility to the empiricist epistemology\nthat appeared to underwrite them. Meanwhile, in a similar spirit,\nIdealist philosophy came under attack. In 1903, the Cambridge\nphilosopher G.E. Moore published an essay entitled \u201cThe\nRefutation of Idealism\u201d. It is arguable that Moore did not\nunderstand what he was aiming to refute, but in any event his essay\nbegan a return to ascendancy by the British empiricist tradition,\naided in part by the Logical Empiricism that emanated from Austria and\nthen took root in America. In due course this spelt the end of British\nIdealism. For empiricists, the most significant Scottish philosopher\nwas now identified as Hume, whose naturalism, ironically, had been\nimportantly rehabilitated by Norman Kemp Smith, Seth's student and\nsuccessor. By this time Reid's star had long been waning, and he\nquickly came to be forgotten. For more than fifty years, both Reid\nand Hegel disappeared from the curriculum and\nconscientiousness of philosophers in Scotland. Accordingly, two major\ncontributors to the 'recent philosophy' that Seth took to be the\nrelevant context of his Gifford Lectures, were silenced. Little\nwonder, then, that his brilliant rapprochement between these\nperpetually antagonistic currents in philosophical thought soon\ndisappeared.",
