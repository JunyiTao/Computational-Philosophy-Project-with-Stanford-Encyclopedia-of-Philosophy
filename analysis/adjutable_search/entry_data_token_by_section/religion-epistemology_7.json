Religious Experience, Revelation and Tradition\n\nReformed epistemology might be thought of as a modification of\nevidentialism in which the permissible kinds of evidence are expanded.\nNotable in  this context is Alston\u2019s work arguing that\ncertain kinds of religious experience can be assimilated to perception\n(Alston 1991).\n\n\nThe difference between reformed epistemology and Enlightenment-style\nevidentialism is also shown by a consideration of revelation and\ninspiration. An evidentialist will consider arguments from the premiss\nthat it is said such and such was revealed or the premiss that so and\nso claimed to be inspired by God, but a reformed epistemologist might\nallow as warranted those religious beliefs grounded in the event of\nrevelation or inspiration.  Thus Mavrodes has argued that any belief\ndue to a genuine revelation is warranted, and has discussed several\nmodes of revelation (Mavrodes 1988). Zagzebski argues that this would\nhave the unacceptable consequence that warrant, and hence knowledge,\nbecomes totally inaccessible either to the person concerned\nor the community (Zagzebski 1993a: 204\u2013205). For instance, Mavrodes\nwould probably not consider Ramanujan\u2019s belief that Krishna is divine\nas warranted, but even if Mavrodes is correct Ramanujan would have no\naccess to this truth about the unwarranted character of his own\nbeliefs.  A similar criticism could be made of beliefs grounded in\nreligious experience. In both cases, the question of whether a belief\nis genuinely grounded in religious experience or is genuinely grounded\nin inspiration is one that several religious traditions have paid\nattention to, with such theories as that of discernment of spirits\n(Murphy, 1990, ch 5).\n\n\nIn what might be called \u201ccounter-reformed epistemology\u201d\nit could be allowed that a belief can be warranted if grounded in a\nreligious tradition. Such a belief would have to be caused in the right\nsort of way by the right sort of tradition. As in the previous cases we\nmight note that such grounding should be partially accessible to the\nbeliever. Rather little work has been done on this\nextension of reformed epistemology, but the social dimension of warrant\nhas been noted (Zagzebski 1993a).\n\n\nMore recently Plantinga (2000) has defended a rather different account of\ndivine inspiration, which he calls the Aquinas/Calvin model. This\nrelies upon the doctrine of \u2018original sin\u2019 claiming that\nmost humans suffer from a cognitive-affective disorder, but that as a\nresult of Redemption the Holy Spirit heals us so that we are able to\nfunction properly, and come to believe the Christian revelation in an\nimmediate, non-inferential manner. In this way the Aquinas/Calvin\nmodel supports the Christian metaphysics, which in turn supports the\nAquinas/Calvin model. Presumably it will be granted that the\nprobability, y, of the Aquinas/Calvin model given Christian\nmetaphysics is significantly less than 100%, because there are rival\nChristian models. As a consequence, the probability, z, of\nChristian metaphysics is less than x/(1\u2212y)\nwhere x is the probability of Christian metaphysics given the\nfalsity of the Aquinas/Calvin model. Hence Plantinga\u2019s proposal can\nsucceed only if either y is near 100% or x is not\ntoo small.\n",
