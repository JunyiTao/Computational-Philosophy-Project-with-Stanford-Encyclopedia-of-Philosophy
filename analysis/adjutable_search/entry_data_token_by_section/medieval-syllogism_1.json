    "main_text": "Boethius\n2. Boethius\n\nThe medieval tradition of logic is generally thought to have begun\nwith Boethius (c. 475\u2013526), who ambitiously tried to preserve\nphilosophical learning from the declining culture of late\nantiquity. In fact, however, he was only able to save parts of ancient\nlogic, primarily Aristotelian logic (see Lee 1984 for a discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistic in late ancient thought). He wrote\nextensively on the theory of the syllogism, producing a Latin\ntranslation of the Prior Analytics, though it was not used\nvery much before the twelfth century (see Aristotle, Analytica\nPriora, and the introduction by Minio-Paluello). He also wrote\ntwo textbooks on the categorical syllogism: On the Categorical\nSyllogism (De syllogismo categorico) and\nIntroduction to Categorical Syllogisms (Introductio ad\nsyllogismos categoricos) (for the texts, see Migne 1847 and\nThomsen Th\u00f6rnqvist 2008). In addition, he produced an interesting\nbook called On Hypothetical Syllogisms (De hypotheticis\nsyllogismis), which will be touched on in the discussion below\n(see Boethius [Obertello 1969] for the text). \n\nBoethius made no substantial contribution to the theory of the\nsyllogism, though he was an important transmitter of the theory to\nlater logicians and his works offer a clear presentation of the\nAristotelian account. But that presentation differs from Aristotle\u2019s\nin one important respect. In Boethius, the categorical sentences are\nconstructed using \u2018is\u2019 (\u2019est\u2019) and\nnot \u2018belongs\u2019, as in Aristotle. The four sentences thus\nbecome:\n\n\na\n\u2013\nEvery B is A \n\ni\n\u2013\nSome B is A \n\ne\n\u2013\nNo B is A \n\no\n\u2013\nSome B is not A \n\n\nPut in this way, it is more obvious that they are subject predicate\nsentences, and moreover, that the syllogisms are deductions rather\nthan conditional sentences. As a result, the four figures look\ndifferent:\n\n\n\nI.\nB \u2013 A\nC \u2013 B\nC \u2013 A\n\n\n\nII.\nA \u2013 B\nC \u2013 B\nC \u2013 A\n\n\n\nIII.\nB \u2013 A\nB \u2013 C\nC \u2013 A\n\n\n\nIV.\nA \u2013 B\nB \u2013 C\nC \u2013 A\n\n\n\nIn systematic terms, Boethius\u2019 change makes no difference and all\nmedieval logicians writing after him adopted it, even though it makes\nthe first figure syllogisms less evident. According to Aristotle, the\nfirst syllogism of the first figure (Barbara) should read: \u2018A\nbelongs to all B, B belongs to all C; therefore A belongs to all\nC\u2019. This is obviously valid by the transitivity of inclusion.\nBut if we line up the same syllogism using Boethian formulation we\nget: \u2018Every B is A, Every C is B; therefore Every C is A\u2019.\nThis is not at all as obvious and we have to switch the places of the\npremises to get the same transitivity characteristic: \u2018Every C\nis B, Every B is A; therefore Every C is A\u2019. Beyond this small\nbut significant change, Boethius does not contribute much to the\ntheory, though he is a little more interested than Aristotle in the\ndifferent kinds of conversion. His hypothetical syllogistic is, on the\nother hand, rather novel.\n\nLike most things in the history of logic, hypothetical syllogistic\nalso begins with Aristotle. In the Prior Analytics, he says\nthat every syllogism is either direct or from a hypothesis.\nTraditional syllogistic is direct and hence all syllogisms that do not\nfall into the patterns of inference defined by the three Aristotelian\nfigures, but which are nevertheless valid syllogisms, must be\nhypothetical. Aristotle\u2019s principal example is a syllogism through\nimpossibility. If we reason from a hypothesis P via a syllogism to a\nconclusion Q that is impossible, then we can conclude that not-P is\ntrue and P false (An. Pr. 41a23\u201330).\n\nIn the second century C.E., Alexander of Aphrodisias tried to develop\nthis into a theory of the hypothetical syllogism. What emerged from\nhis attempt is something quite strange and even confused, though it\nhas been studied at great length (see esp. Speca 2001 and the list of\nfurther references there). Boethius\u2019 On the Hypothetical\nSyllogisms is the only remaining early work on this topic.\n\nA hypothetical syllogism is a syllogism in which one or more premises\nare hypothetical sentences. Boethius draws the distinction between\ncategorical sentences and hypothetical sentences formally by saying\nthat a categorical sentence involves a predication whereas a\nhypothetical sentence involves a condition, i.e., it says that\nsomething is, if something else is. Typically such sentences\nare conditional sentences such as \u2018if P then Q\u2019, though\nBoethius also treats \u2018P or Q\u2019 as hypothetical, apparently\nbecause he thinks that disjunction can be translated in terms of a\nconditional sentence. Another characteristic of hypothetical sentences\nis that they are made up of categorical sentences.\n\nThe basic hypothetical sentences he gives are:\n\n(2:1)\n If it is A, then it is B\n(2:2)\n If it is not-A, then it is not-B\n(2:3)\n If it is A, then it is not-B\n(2:4)\n If it is not-A, then it is B\n\n\nHe also considers sentences involving three terms:\n\n(2:5)\n If, if it is A, then it is B, then it is C\n(2:6)\n If it is A, then if it is B, then it is C\n\n\nthough a hypothetical sentence can be even more complicated:\n\n(2:7)\nIf, if it is A, then it is B, then if it is C, then it is D.\n\n\nBoethius also thinks that hypothetical sentences can be qualified by\nmodalities such as necessity or possibility, but he never develops\nthis idea.\n\nIn trying to establish what combination of premises form valid\ninferences he proceeds like Aristotle and develops lists or tables in\nwhich he can group the valid patterns. The basic sentences (2:1)\u2013(2:4)\ncombined with a simple categorical sentence as the second premise boil\ndown to what we today know as modus ponens and modus\ntollens. This led some modern interpreters to think that Boethius\nwas developing a sentential logic as the Stoics had done (D\u00fcrr\n1951), but this idea has been rejected by more recent scholars\n(Obertello 1969, Martin 1991 and Speca 2001). Whatever Boethius\nthought he was doing, he was not trying to develop a sentential logic.\nThis becomes obvious if one considers a more complex hypothetical\nsyllogism, such as the following, which he accepts as valid:\n\nIf it is A, then if it is B, then it is C \nIf it is B, then it is not-C\nIt is not-A \n\n\nIf Boethius\u2019 logic is a sentential logic his syllogism would be\ntranslatable into the following:\n\nA \\(\\supset\\) (B \\(\\supset\\) C)\nB \\(\\supset\\) \\(\\sim\\)C\n\\(\\sim\\)A\n\n But this is not a valid deduction, since if A is assumed to be\ntrue and B false, the conclusion that follows, not-A, remains false\ndespite both premises being true.  If, on the other hand, Boethius\nmeans his reader not to take them for sentences but rather, following\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistic, terms, which carry no truth-value by\nthemselves, then the inference schema can be given a valid\ninterpretation, as long as one allows for the way that Boethius\nunderstood negation and compound conditionals (see Martin 2009,\n76\u201378). If a thing is A then it must be that if it is B then it\nis C. So, if we also have that if it is B then it is not-C,\nthen it could not be A, so it must be not-A.  This example alone thus\nalready suggests that, despite some formal similarities to sentential\nlogic, Boethius is actually operating with something more akin to the\nterm logic that preceded him rather than in some newer, original,\npre-modern formulation of sentential logic. \n \nBoethius is conscious of a Stoic logical tradition in which the\nlogical forms of sentences were distinguished according to their\nlinguistic form, such that \u2018if \u2026 then\u2019 structures\nindicate conditionals and \u2018or\u2019 structures indicate\ndisjunctions, making these terms rather like operators on sentences.\nHe seems to be using these ideas to demarcate his hypothetical\nsentences, though he is still writing in an Aristotelian fashion and\ndeveloping an Aristotelian term logic (see Speca 2001 and Marenbon\n2003: 50\u201356). This mix makes his logic quite confused, and the\nconfusion was not sorted out until Abelard was able to develop a\nproper sentential logic out of Boethius\u2019 suggestions.
