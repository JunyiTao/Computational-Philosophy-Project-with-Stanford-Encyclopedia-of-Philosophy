    "main_text": "Feminist Theoretical Approaches to Globalization || Key Common Features\n2.1 Key Common Features\n\nFirst, feminist approaches to globalization seek to provide frameworks\nfor understanding the gender injustices associated with globalization.\nRather than developing all-encompassing ideal theories of global\njustice, however, feminist philosophers tend to adopt the non-ideal\ntheoretical perspectives, which focus on specific, concrete issues.\nEarly feminist analyses focused on issues that were widely believed to\nbe of particular importance to women around the world, such as\ndomestic violence, workplace discrimination, and human rights\nviolations against women. While gendered analyses of these issues have\nprovided valuable insights into the distinctive nature of the harms\ninvolved, many feminist philosophers view this approach as too narrow,\nboth in terms of the specific issues it addresses and its\nmethodological approach to these issues. They contend that even\napparently gender-neutral global issues often have a gendered\ndimension, including war, global governance, migration, southern debt,\nthe \u201cresource curse,\u201d and climate change. Moreover, by\naddressing specific global \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d as\nindependent phenomena, early feminist analyses failed to take into\naccount the systematic and structural gendered injustices associated\nwith neoliberalism. Although gender oppression takes different forms\nin different social, cultural, and geographical locations, women in\nevery society face systematic disadvantages, such as those resulting\nfrom their socially assigned responsibility for domestic work (Lange\n2009). Because of these structural injustices, women of all\nnationalities tend to suffer more from the poverty, overwork,\ndeprivation, and political marginalization associated with neoliberal\npolicies. Thus, more recent feminist analyses of globalization tend to\nunderstand the outcomes of globalization not as disparate or\ncontingent phenomena, but rather as a result of systematic, structural\ninjustices on a global scale. Indeed, some contend that the global\nbasic structure itself is implicitly biased against women (Jaggar\n2009a).\n\nThe second key feature of feminist approaches to globalization is a\nshared commitment to core feminist values, including an opposition to\nthe subordination of women. Some theorists also draw upon feminist\ninterpretations of mainstream moral and political ideals, such as\nequality, democracy, and human rights, to develop critiques of\nneoliberal policies. For instance, Jaggar appeals to liberal\ndemocratic norms to argue that many southern debt obligations are not\nmorally binding because their citizenries were \u201clargely\nuninformed and/or their options were virtually non-existent\u201d\nwhen they undertook these supposed debts (Jaggar 2002a, 433). Many\nfeminists also use the language of human rights to address the\nchallenges of globalization. While they acknowledge that traditional\nunderstandings of human rights are implicitly male-biased, they\ncontend that feminist rearticulations of these norms can help to\nidentify the gendered harms involved in sexual slavery, forced\ndomestic labor, and the systematic withholding of education, food, and\nhealthcare from women and girls that follow from severe economic\ndeprivation (Bunch 2006, Cudd 2005, Jaggar 2002a, Nussbaum 2001,\nRobinson 2004, Okin 1998, Reilly 2007). (See Section 3.3 below.)\n\nHowever, not all feminist political philosophers agree with this\napproach. Some believe that new feminist ideals, such as relational\nunderstandings of power, collective responsibility, and mutual\ndependence, are needed to diagnose the gender injustices associated\nwith globalization (Hankivsky 2006, Held 2004, 2007, Kittay 2008,\n2009, Miller 2006, 2011, Robinson 2006, 2010, Weir 2008a, 2008b, Young\n2011). For instance, Iris Marion Young argues the traditional ideal\ntheories of justice are unable to account for the unjust background\nconditions that contribute to the development of sweatshops in the\nglobal South. She argues that a new relational model of\nresponsibility, which she calls the social connection model, is needed\nto articulate the obligations that people in affluent northern\ncountries have to workers in the global South. The social connection\nmodel holds that individuals bear responsibility for structural\ninjustices, such as those suffered by workers on the global assembly\nline, because our actions contribute to the institutional processes\nthat produce such injustices. In particular, northern consumers have a\nresponsibility to organize collectively to reform the injustices\nassociated with sweatshop labor (Young 2011).\n\nThe third key feature of feminist approaches to globalization is an\nemphasis on feminist methodologies. In particular, these approaches\ntend to embody three key methodological commitments. The first is\nintersectionality, which maintains that systems of oppression interact\nto produce injustices, and thus, that gender injustices cannot be\nunderstood solely in terms of sex or gender. Feminists who theorize\nabout justice on the domestic level argue that women\u2019s\nexperiences of gender oppression are shaped by other forms of\noppression, such as those based on race, class, disability, and sexual\norientation. Feminist theorists of globalization contend that gender\noppression interacts with these systems of oppression, along with\nother forms of systematic disadvantage that arise within the global\ncontext. Salient categories include nationality, geographical\nlocation, citizenship status, and socioeconomic position within the\nglobal economy (for instance, as a Southern elite, a Western laborer,\nor a worker on the global assembly line). Given this broad conception\nof intersectionality, feminist theorists of globalization insist that\ngender injustices arise within specific transnational contexts, such\nas historical relationships among nations and current global economic\npolicies. \n\nThe second methodological commitment shared by feminist approaches to\nglobalization is a sensitivity to context and concrete specificity.\nFeminist philosophers strive to accurately reflect the diverse\ninterests, experience, and concerns of women throughout the world, and\nto take seriously differences in culture, history, and socio-economic\nand political circumstances. In this way, feminist approaches to\nglobalization attempt to move between local conditions and global\npressures, between historical realities and contemporary experiences\nof oppression and vulnerability, while being attentive to complex\ninteractions among social, economic, and political forces. This has\nled some feminist theorists of globalization to distinguish their\nviews from well-known feminists, such as Martha Nussbaum and Susan\nOkin, whom Ackerly and Attanasi refer to as \u201cinternational\nfeminists\u201d by virtue of their methodological commitments. In\ntheir view, Nussbaum and Okin do not pay sufficient attention to the\nways that justice and injustice are mediated by local conditions in\ntheir attempts to identify universal moral ideals. As a result, their\ntheories tend to privilege Western perspectives and undermine their\nown commitment to reflecting women\u2019s lived experience (Ackerly\nand Attanasi 2009).\n\nFinally, feminist theorists of globalization are committed to\ndeveloping self-reflexive critiques. At the heart of this methodology\nis a willingness to critically examine feminist claims, with\nparticular attention to the ways in which feminist discourses\nprivilege certain points of view. For instance, Schutte insists that\nostensibly universal feminist values and ideas are likely to embody\nthe values of dominant cultures. This helps to explain why the voices\nof women from developing countries are often taken seriously only if\nthey reflect the norms and values of the West and conform to Western\nexpectations. Thus, Schutte insists that feminists must engage in\nmethodological practices that de-center their habitual standpoints and\nforeground perspectives that challenge accepted ways of thinking\n(Schutte 2002). Khader extends this call, urging transnational\nfeminists to reject the problematic variants of \u201cEnlightenment\nliberal\u201d values taken to be central to Western feminism,\nincluding individualism, autonomy, and gender-role eliminativism\n(Khader 2019, 3). Such values not only constitute cultural imperialism\nwhen imposed on cultural \u201cothers,\u201d as Schutte argues, but\nalso can serve to justify militarism, political domination, economic\nexploitation, and white supremacy in the name of advancing gender\ninterests (Khader 2019). Ackerly argues that feminist theory can be\nused not only to critique feminist ideals and values, but also to\ndevelop richer ways to evaluate the work done by women\u2019s human\nrights organizations. Feminist theory is able to engage with, shape\nand be shaped by the work being done \u201con the ground\u201d by\nNGOs and other groups (Ackerly 2009). \n\nThe struggle to develop feminist theories that embody these\nmethodological commitments has been ongoing for feminists. In the\n1980s, Chandra Talpade Mohanty observed that Western feminist\nscholarship tends to adopt an ethnocentric perspective, depicting\nso-called Third-World women as one-dimensional, non-agentic, and\nhomogenous. In her often-cited words, such scholarship tends to\nsuggest that:\n\nthe average Third World woman leads an essentially truncated life\nbased on her feminine gender (read: sexually constrained) and her\nbeing \u201cThird World\u201d (read: ignorant, poor, uneducated,\ntradition-bound, domestic, family-oriented, victimized, etc.). This, I\nsuggest, is in contrast to the (implicit) self-representation of\nWestern women as educated, as modern, as having control over their own\nbodies and sexualities and the freedom to make their own decisions\n(Mohanty 2003, 22).\n\n\nMohanty claims that this perspective leads to a simplistic\nunderstanding of what feminists in Western countries can do to\n\u201chelp\u201d women in developing nations. Many of the recent\ndevelopments in the feminist literature on globalization can be\nunderstood as a response to this theoretical failure. In addition to\nrecognizing the ways in which power influences the production of\nfeminist theories, feminist critics of globalization strive to\nunderstand the ways in which Western women share responsibility for\ngender injustices in developing countries and at home, and to\narticulate their obligations to eliminate these injustices.\n",
