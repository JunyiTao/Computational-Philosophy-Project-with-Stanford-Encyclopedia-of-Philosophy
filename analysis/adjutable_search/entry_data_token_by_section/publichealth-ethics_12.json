    "main_text": "Political legitimacy and Public Health || Legitimacy, Efficiency, and Overall Benefit\n3.1 Legitimacy, Efficiency, and Overall Benefit\n\nSome argue that public health institutions are legitimate in virtue of\nthe particular kinds of benefits they produce. Specifically, these are\nbenefits that are experienced by each of us as individuals but that we\ncannot secure for ourselves on our own. Moreover, these benefits are\nso important that successfully producing them overcomes the\npresumption against interfering with free and equal persons. For\nexample, we all want to be protected from infectious diseases and\nunsafe or ineffective medication. However, these kinds of benefits\ncannot be secured absent regulatory agencies such as the Center for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) which have the expertise and authority to respond\nto a potential epidemic or permit only safe and effective drugs to be\nmarketed to the public. According to this line of reasoning, public\nhealth policies made by experts and enforced by the state are better\nfor us overall, even if particular decisions may not directly benefit\nall of us all of the time.\n\nAccording to this rationale, the task of public health ethics is not\nnecessarily to justify each particular decision or intervention\ndirectly. Rather, as long as it stays within certain pre-established\nparameters, public health public health in general can be justified in\nthe same way a market economy, the laws of private property, or other\nsimilarly broad and useful institutions that involve some interference\nwith free and equal persons but also enable individuals to access\ngreater benefits can be justified: when properly regulated and\nmanaged, their existence is by and large better than their absence for\neveryone. So structured, the justification for particular public\nhealth interventions, requirements, or restrictions is derivative of\nor parasitic on a higher-level rationale.\n\nA closely related justification emphasizes that the pursuit of health\nis not possible without ground rules for coordinated action and\nnear-universal participation. Thus, public health is viewed as having\nthe structure of a coordination or collective efficiency problem. If\none person (or at least, a sufficient number of such persons) decides\nto go when the traffic light is red and stop when the traffic light is\ngreen, it does not matter that everyone else is following the rules:\nthis person will disrupt the smooth functioning of the system, with\npotentially dangerous results. Similarly, if one person (or a\nsufficient critical mass of such persons) decides not to abide by a\npublic health regulation because the regulation does not directly\nbenefit her or she otherwise objects, the ramifications will likely be\nfelt by others in her environment and\n beyond.[19]\n Almost everybody has to participate because, failing their\ninvolvement, neither they nor anyone else is likely to be as healthy\nas they might otherwise be, and none can fully reap the benefit of a\nhealthy society.\n\nIn many public health contexts, the only feasible or acceptably\nefficient way to implement a policy affects the entire population,\nleaving no or only very burdensome options open to individual\nnon-cooperation. Perhaps the most celebrated such example is water\nfluoridation, but all safety regulations affecting the food and drug\nsupply and consumer products share this character, as do many\nenvironmental and occupational health standards. Here collective\nefficiency considerations loom large. Although we want healthy\nenvironments and products, individuals are simply not positioned on\ntheir own to ensure that the air is safe to breathe, nor can they make\nmeaningful decisions about the safety of the hundreds of thousands of\nfood and other products available in the modern marketplace. According\nto this rationale, ceding this function to government institutions\nstaffed with health experts is justified in the same way as ceding\nprotection of our interests in personal physical security to\ngovernment institutions staffed with law enforcement and national\ndefense experts (Mill 1859).\n\nCollective efficiency arguments rely on claims about the sheer number\nand technical complexity of the decisions that need to be made to\nprotect health in the environment and in the marketplace, as well as\nthe indivisible character of responses to some health threats. These\narguments are buttressed by claims about the cognitive limitations and\nbounded rationality of individual human decision-makers and by the\ndisproportionate political power of corporate interests and the\npractices they use to manipulate and exploit our cognitive weaknesses\nagainst our health interests (Ubel 2009).\n\nThe appeal to overall benefit or collective efficiency has\nconsiderable attractiveness, particularly as a way of justifying the\nexistence of regulatory government agencies such as the EPA, FDA, or\nCDC. However, it is ultimately insufficient on its own and needs to be\nsupplemented by other kinds of ethical arguments, since it does not\nprovide the basis for the parameters within which such agencies should\noperate, or for ethical oversight or scrutiny with regards to the\nparticular decisions such agencies\n take.[20]\n",
