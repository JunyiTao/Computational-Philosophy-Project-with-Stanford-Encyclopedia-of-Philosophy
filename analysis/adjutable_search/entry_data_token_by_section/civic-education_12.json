    "main_text": "The Good Person || Good Persons and Good Citizens\n3.1 Good Persons and Good Citizens\n\nTwo groups predominate in advocating the use of character education as\na way of improving democracy. One group comprises political theorists\nsuch as Galston, Battistoni, Benjamin Barber, and Adrian Oldfield who\noften reflect modern-day versions of civic republicanism. This group\nwishes to instill or\n nurture[7]\n a willingness among our future citizens to sacrifice their\nself-interests for the sake of the common good. Participation on this\nview is important both to stabilize society and to enhance each\nindividual\u2019s human flourishing through the promotion of our\ncollective welfare.\n\nThe second group does not see democratic participation as the center,\nbut instead sees democratic participation as one aspect of overall\ncharacter education. Central to the mission of our public schools, on\nthis view, is the establishing of character traits important both to\nindividual conduct (being a good person) and to a thriving democracy\n(being a good citizen). The unannounced leader of the second group is\neducational practitioner Thomas Lickona, and it includes such others\nas William Bennett and Patricia White.\n\nNeither group describes in actual terms what might be called\n\u201cdemocratic character.\u201d Though their work intimates such\ncharacter, they talk more about character traits important to human\ngrowth and well-being, which also happen to be related to democratic\nparticipation. What traits do these pundits discuss, and what do they\nmean by \u201ccharacter\u201d?\n\nIt is difficult, comments British philosopher R. S. Peters, \u201cto\ndecide what in general we mean when we speak of a person\u2019s\ncharacter as distinct from his nature, his temperament, and his\npersonality\u201d (1966, p. 40). Many advocates of character\neducation are vague on just this distinction, and it might be helpful\nto propose that character consists of traits that are learned, while\npersonality and temperament consist of traits that are\n innate.[8]\n\nWhat advocates are clear on, however, is that character is the essence\nof what we are. The term comes from the world of engraving, from the\nGreek term kharakter, an instrument used for making\ndistinctive marks. Thus character is what marks a person or persons as\ndistinctive.\n\nCharacter is not just one attribute or trait. It signifies the sum\ntotal of particular traits, the \u201csum of mental and moral\nqualities\u201d (O.E.D., p. 163). The addition of\n\u201cmoral qualities\u201d to the definition may be insignificant,\nfor character carries with it a connotation of \u201cgood\u201d\ntraits. Thus character traits are associated, if not synonymous, with\nvirtues. So a good person and, in the context of liberal democracy, a\ngood citizen will have these virtues.\n\nTo Thomas Lickona a virtue is \u201ca reliable inner disposition to\nrespond to situations in a morally good way\u201d (p. 51);\n\u201cgood character,\u201d he continues, \u201cconsists of knowing\nthe good, desiring the good, and doing the good\u201d (Idem). Who\ndetermines what the good is? In general, inculcated traits or virtues\nor dispositions are used \u201cin following rules of conduct.\u201d\nThese are the rules that reinforce social conventions and social order\n(Peters, p. 40). So in this view social convention determines what\n\u201cgood\u201d means.\n\nThis might be problematic. What occurs when the set of virtues of the\ngood person clashes with the set of virtues of the good citizen? What\nis thought to be good in one context, even when approved by society,\nis not necessarily what is thought to be good in another. Should the\nonly child of a deceased farmer stay at home to care for his ailing\nmother, or should he, like a good citizen, join the resistance to\nfight an occupying army?\n\nWhat do we do when the requirements of civic education call into\nquestion the values or beliefs of what one takes to be the values of\nbeing a good person? In Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of\nEducation just such a case occurred. Should the Mozerts and other\nfundamentalist Christian parents have the right to opt their children\nout of those classes that required their children to read selections\nthat went against or undermined their faith? On the one hand, if they\nare permitted to opt out, then without those children present the\nclass is denied the diversity of opinion on the reading selections\nthat would be educative and a hallmark of democracy. On the other\nhand, if the children cannot opt out, then they are denied the right\nto follow their faith as they think\n necessary.[9]\n",
