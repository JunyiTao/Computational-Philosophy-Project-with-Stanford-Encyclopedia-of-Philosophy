    "main_text": "Problems || The View of Language\n10.3 The View of Language\n\nUndoubtedly Croce was influenced by his lifelong immersion in\nliterature in his proclamation that all language is poetry. And\nperhaps it is true that all language has some poetic qualities, and\nperhaps it is true that language \u2018in its actuality\u2019\nconsists of sentential utterances. But as Bosanquet pointed out in\n1919, this does not mean that language is only poetry, or\nthat the referential dimension of language does not exist. It must\nhave something that distinguishes a scientific treatise from a\ntune\u2014in fact it must be the same thing, which we are calling the\nreferential dimension, that serves to distinguish poetry from\na tune (it has to have sound and sense, as we say). So to say\nthat drawings and tunes are equally good examples of language seems,\nat best, strained. Perhaps Croce would have said that the referential\ndimension does not exist, or is a false abstraction; but his general\nphilosophical views may be forcing him down an unprepossessing path.\nMore promising would be a formalist endeavor to try to isolate the\npure sonic aspect of poetry\u2014comprising metre, alliteration and\nso on\u2014and then to search for instantiations or at least\nanalogies in the other arts.\n",
