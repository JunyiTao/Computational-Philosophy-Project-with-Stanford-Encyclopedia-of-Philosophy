    "main_text": "The Five Core Philosophical Problems Today\n3. The Five Core Philosophical Problems Today\n\nTheories need both essences and histories.\nStephen Jay Gould (2002, 1)\n\n\n\nSo reads the heading of the very first section of the first chapter of\nGould\u2019s monumental The Structure of Evolutionary\nTheory. Opening with a subtle reading of an exchange of letters\nin 1863 between paleontologist Hugh Falconer and Charles Darwin, Gould\neventually explains what he has in mind by this section heading:\n\n In short, \u201cThe structure of evolutionary theory\u201d combines enough\nstability for coherence with enough change to keep any keen mind in a\nperpetual mode of search and challenge.  (Gould 2002, 6)\n\n\nGould, of course, was both an unabashed admirer of Charles Darwin and\none of the most outspoken critics of the \u2018neo-Darwinian\nsynthesis\u2019.  I will be using both his account of \u2018the\nEssence of Darwinism\u2019 in Part I of this magnum opus and his\narguments for a \u2018Revised and Expanded Evolutionary Theory\u2019\nin its Part II as touchstones and targets.\n\n\nIn the preceding section of this essay, I organized my discussion of\nthe problems that Darwin\u2019s allies had with Darwin\u2019s Darwinism\naround five issues: [i] the role of chance as a factor in evolutionary\ntheory and the theory\u2019s apparently probabilistic nature; [ii] the\nnature of selection; [iii] the question of whether\nselection/adaptation explanations are teleological; [iv] the\nontological status of species and the epistemological status of\nspecies concepts; and [v] the implications of Darwin\u2019s insistence on\nthe slow and gradual nature of evolutionary change. I claimed that one\nvery good reason for continuing to characterize one dominant approach\nto evolutionary biology, that represented by the so-called\n\u2018Neo-Darwinian Synthesis\u2019, as \u2018Darwinism\u2019 is\nthat its proponents side with Darwin on these issues (and on many less\nfundamental ones besides). That in itself is remarkable, but it is the\nmore so because the Darwinian position on each of these issues is\nunder as much pressure from non-Darwinian evolutionary biologists\ntoday as it was in the wake of the Origin. It is not\nsurprising, given the situation as I have just characterized it, that historians and\nphilosophers of biology have made significant contributions to the\ndiscussion, especially in pointing out the underlying philosophical issues\n and conceptual confusions and ambiguities that stand\nin the way of resolving the issues at hand, and their historical origins.\n\n\nIt is my conviction that a full understanding of the underlying\nphilosophical disagreements on these questions will only come from a\npatient historical study of how the \u2018Synthesis\u2019 positions\non these various issues, and those of their critics, arose. That I\ncannot do here. Rather, in what follows I will simply be presupposing\ncertain answers to these questions of historical origins.  The list of\nreferences at the end of this essay includes a number of excellent\npieces of work on this subject for those who share my convictions\nabout its importance.\n",
