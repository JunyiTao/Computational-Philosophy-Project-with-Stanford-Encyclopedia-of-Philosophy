    "main_text": "Randomness Without Chance || Classical Indeterminism\n5.3 Classical Indeterminism\n\n\nDespite the neat picture of classical determinism drawn in the\nprevious section, it is well known that classical physics is not in\nfact deterministic. These cases of indeterminism do not undermine the\napplications of classical mechanics in the previous section. But\nclassical indeterminism may provide problems of its own for RCT. Useful\nfurther material on the topic of this section can be found in the entry\non causal determinism\n (Hoefer 2010:\n \u00a74.1).\n\n\nFor present purposes, indeterminism occurs when the state of the\nsystem at one time does not uniquely fix the state the system will be\nin at some future time (see\n \u00a77).\n To show\nindeterminism in the classical case, it suffices to give a state of\nsome system at a given time and to specify two future states that are\nincompatible with each other and yet both states are consistent with\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion and the initial state.\n\n\nTo help us in this task, it is useful to note one fact about\nNewtonian mechanics: the laws are time-reversal invariant\n(Albert 2000: ch. 1). That is, for every lawful trajectory through the\nstate space, there is another lawful trajectory which results from the\nfirst by mapping every instantaneous state in the first trajectory to\nits image state in which the particles have the same positions but the\nsigns on the components of momentum are reversed, and running the\ntrajectory in reverse order. These image states are those where the\nparticles are in the same positions but moving in exactly the opposite\ndirection. So for every lawful process, that process running backwards\nis also lawful. (If these trajectories are so lawful, why don\u2019t we see\nthem?\u2014that is the deep question of thermodynamic asymmetry,\ndiscussed briefly in supplement\n D.)\n\n\nTwo examples serve to illustrate the possibility of classical\nindeterminism. A very elegant recent example is provided by\n\u2018Norton\u2019s dome\u2019 (Norton 2003; 2008). A point mass is at\nrest at the apex of a dome (of certain shape) at\n\\(t^*\\). One obvious solution to Newton\u2019s equations of\nmotion is that it continues to do so for all moments \\(t \\gt t^*\\). But, Norton points out, there is another\nsolution: that while at \\(t = t^*\\) the mass is\nat rest, at every moment \\(t \\gt t^*\\), the\nmass is moving in some direction. But this means the mass spontaneously\nmoves off in some arbitrary direction at an arbitrary\n time.[21]\nDeterminism is clearly violated: for some given time\n\\(t^*\\), there is a state at \\(t'\\) where the\nparticle remains at the apex of the dome; and there are many\nincompatible states where at \\(t'\\) the particle is\nsomewhere else on the surface of the dome. Nothing in the conditions at\n\\(t^*\\) fixes which of these many future states will be\nthe one to eventuate. An easy way to understand the dome example is to\nconsider its time reversal: a ball is given some initial velocity along\nthe surface of the dome toward the apex. Too little, and it falls\nshort; too great, and it overshoots. Just right, however, and the ball\ncomes to rest precisely at the apex, and remains at rest. The time\nreversal of this system is the original dome example.\n\n\nA more exotic example involves \u2018space invaders\u2019 (Earman\n1986: ch. III). These are particles that are at no spatial location at\ntime \\(t\\), and therefore form no part of the state at time\n\\(t\\), but which travel in \u2018from\u2019 spatial infinity and\nby time \\(t'\\) have a location. We can see the example more\nclearly if we invoke time-reversal invariance. Consider two point\nparticles, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), at rest and in the vicinity of\none another at \\(t^*\\). From \\(t^*\\)\nonwards, force is applied to \\(a\\) in such a way that the velocity\nof \\(a\\) away from \\(b\\) increases without bound. This is\npossible, because there is no upper bound on velocity in classical\nphysics. Indeed, let the velocity of \\(a\\) increase fast enough\nthat by some finite time \\(t', a\\) has no finite\nvelocity, and is thus \u2018at\u2019 spatial infinity. The\ntime-reversal of this system has the particle \\(a\\) having no\nlocation at \\(t'\\), but having a location and continuously\ndecreasing velocity at every moment \\(t \\gt t'\\),\nuntil it comes to rest at \\(t^*\\). This system violates\ndeterminism in the sense given above. The state at \\(t'\\)\nconsists of a single particle \\(b\\) at rest. That state could be\nfollowed at \\(t^*\\) by the space-invaded state just\ndescribed; or it could be followed at \\(t^*\\) by the\nincompatible state of \\(b\\) simply being at rest some more.\nNothing in the laws rules out either of these transitions. Of course,\nthe model isn\u2019t particularly physically realistic\u2014where does the\nforce acting on \\(a\\) come from? But physically more realistic\nsystems exhibiting the same general structure have been given; Earman\nmentions one due to Mather and McGehee (1975) involving four point\nparticles moving in such a way that the forces they exert on each other\nin collisions end up unboundedly far from one another in a finite time\n(see also Saari and Xia 1995).\n\n\nWhile classical mechanics is thus indeterministic, it is importantly\nnot chancy. There is no reason to think that we either need to or can\nassign a probability distribution over the possible future states in\nour indeterministic systems. Norton says this about his dome:\n\n\n\nOne might think that \u2026 we can assign probabilities to the\nvarious possible outcomes. Nothing in the Newtonian physics requires us\nto assign the probabilities, but we might choose to try to add them for\nour own conceptual comfort. It can be done as far as the direction of\nthe spontaneous motion is concerned. The symmetry of the surface about\nthe apex makes it quite natural for us to add a probability\ndistribution that assigns equal probability to all directions. The\ncomplication is that there is no comparable way for us to assign\nprobabilities for the time of the spontaneous excitation that respect\nthe physical symmetries of solutions. Those solutions treat all\ncandidate excitation times \\(T\\) equally. A probability\ndistribution that tries to make each candidate time equally likely\ncannot be proper\u2014that is, it cannot assign unit probability to\nthe union of all disjoint\n outcomes.[22]\n Or one that is proper\ncan only be defined by inventing extra physical properties, not given\nby the physical description of the dome and mass, Newton\u2019s laws and the\nlaws of gravitation, and grafting them unnaturally onto the physical\nsystem. (Norton 2003: 9\u201310)\n\n\n\nThe point Norton makes about the impossibility of a uniform\ndistribution over a countable set of time intervals holds also for the\ntime at which we might expect the space invader to occur in the second\ntype of case. Thus, it seems, we have indeterminism without chance.\n\n\nWe can use these constructions to come up with counterexamples to\nRCT. Let a dome system be prepared, and left for a period of 5 seconds.\nIf the ball remains at rest on the apex, call the outcome\n\u20180\u2019. If the ball moves, and so is at the end of 5 seconds\nsomewhere on the dome other than the apex, call the outcome\n\u20181\u2019. Both outcomes are physically possible final states of\nthe system after 5 seconds. If the system is repeatedly prepared in\nthis state, it is physically possible to get a random sequence of\noutcomes of these repeated trials. Certainly the outcomes cannot be\nproduced by some finite algorithm, since the indeterministic dynamics\npermits as physically possible every sequence of outcomes, including\nthose that differ at some place from every algorithmically compressible\nsequence. In the infinite future case, it is physically possible for\nthe system to produce every infinite binary sequence, but at most\ncountably many of these are non-random. So it is physically possible\nfor these setups to produce a random sequence of outcomes in the KML\nsense. But we then have randomness without a chance distribution over\nthe outcomes. Randomness only requires two distinguishable possible\noutcomes and the possibility of production of arbitrary sequences of\nsuch outcomes. Chance requires two distinguishable outcomes, each of\nwhich has some chance. These cases show that chance and possibility\ncome apart\u2014there are cases where there are two possible outcomes\nof a process, neither of which has any chance at all (not even a chance\nof zero).\n",
