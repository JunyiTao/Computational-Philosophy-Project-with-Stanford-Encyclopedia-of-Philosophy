    "main_text": "Arguments in Favor of the Representational Theory of Sensory Qualities || The Argument from Hallucination\n3.5 The Argument from Hallucination\n\nPautz (2007, 2010) appeals to hallucinatory experience. Suppose you\nhallucinate (simultaneously) a red ellipse, an orange circle, and a\ngreen square, without ever previously having encountered any of those\ncolors or shapes. That experience directly gives you the capacity to\nform beliefs about the external world, e.g., that there is a red\nellipse, that red is more like orange than like green, and that\nellipses are more like circles than like squares. This\n\u201cgrounding property\u201d of the experience motivates a\n\u201crelational\u201d view of it, according to which having the\nexperience puts the subject in a relation to \u201citems involving\nproperties which, if they are properties of anything at all, are\nproperties of extended objects\u201d (2007, p. 524). Pautz offers two\nfurther arguments for relationality, based respectively on the\n\u201cmatching property\u201d and the \u201ccharacterization\nproperty.\u201d\n\nGiven relationality, representationalism still has three rivals:\nsense-data, Peacocke\u2019s (2008) \u201csensationalist\u201d\ntheory, and Alston\u2019s (1999) \u201ctheory of appearing.\u201d\nBut each of the rivals succumbs to objections; so representationalism\nis true of hallucinatory experience. Now, why not extend\nrepresentationalism to experience across the board? At this point\nthere is just one still unrefuted opponent: the \u201cpositive\u201d\ndisjunctivist who maintains that veridical experience differs\nradically in kind from hallucination. Pautz argues that that view is\nnot worth the complications it enforces.\n\nIt remains to show that an experience\u2019s characteristic\nqualitative properties can be identified with its representational\nproperties. At this point Pautz appeals to the assumption that for any\nqualitative difference between two visual experiences, the difference\nhas a spatial component, either in distinguishing two subregions of\none\u2019s visual field or in attending to one rather than another.\nIn no case, Pautz maintains, is there going to be an experiential\ndifference without a representational difference.\n\nSince Pautz has proceeded by objecting to various competing views, we\nmust hear what their respective proponents will say in rebuttal.\n",
