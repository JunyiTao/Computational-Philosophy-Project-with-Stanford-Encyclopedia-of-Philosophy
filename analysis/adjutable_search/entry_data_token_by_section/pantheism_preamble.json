    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u2018pantheism\u2019 is a modern one, possibly first\nappearing in the writing of the Irish freethinker John Toland (1705)\nand constructed from the Greek roots pan (all) and\ntheos (God). But if not the name, the ideas themselves are\nvery ancient, and any survey of the history of philosophy will uncover\nnumerous pantheist or pantheistically inclined thinkers; although it\nshould also be noted that in many cases all that history has preserved\nfor us are second-hand reportings of attributed doctrines, any\nreconstruction of which is too conjectural to provide much by way of\nphilosophical illumination (see Kahn 1960).\n\nAt its most general, pantheism may be understood either (a)\npositively, as the view that God is identical with the cosmos (i.e.,\nthe view that there exists nothing which is outside of God), or (b)\nnegatively, as the rejection of any view that considers God as\ndistinct from the universe.\n\nHowever, given the complex and contested nature of the concepts\ninvolved, there is insufficient consensus among philosophers to permit\nthe construction of any more detailed definition not open to serious\nobjection from some quarter or other. Moreover, the label is a\ncontroversial one, where strong desires either to appropriate or to\nreject it often serve only to obscure the actual issues, and it would\nbe a sad irony if pantheism revealed itself to be most like a\ntraditional religion in its sectarian disputes over just what counts\nas \u2018true pantheism.\u2019 Therefore pantheism should not be\nthought of as a single codifiable position. Rather it should be\nunderstood as a diverse family of distinct doctrines; many of whom\nwould be surprised\u2014and, indeed, disconcerted\u2014to find\nthemselves regarded as members of a single household. Further, since\nthe concept has porous and disputed boundaries there is no clear\nconsensus on just who qualifies, no definitive roll-call of past\npantheists. Given this situation the range of things that may be\nusefully said about all pantheisms is perhaps limited, but\nnonetheless a variety of concepts may be clarified, the nature of\ncontentious issues explored, and the range of possible options more\nprecisely mapped out (see Buckareff & Nagasawa 2016; Buckareff\n2022).\n",
