    "main_text": "Epistemology || .5 Kinds of cognition III: Intuition\n4. Eternity of the mind\n\nSpinoza\u2019s doctrine of the eternity of the mind, one of last\nsubjects of the Ethics, has occasioned some of the most\nimpatient and uncharitable comments on the part of his readers (most\nfamously perhaps, Bennett 1984 describes it as \u201crubbish\u201d\nleading others to write rubbish). The cause for this impatience is\nSpinoza\u2019s declaration that in Part 5 he will discuss \u201cthe\nmind\u2019s duration without relation to the body\u201d (E5p20s), a\ndeclaration some see as a blatant violation of his commitment to\nmind-body identity in Part 2 (E2p7s). But of course an identity of one\nthing with another doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility of\ndiscussing one but not the other, a procedure in which\nSpinoza engages again and again (for example, in introducing the\npossibility of ideas of ideas [see 2.3]). Spinoza is moreover quite\nexplicit that there is no eternity of human minds without a\ncorresponding eternity of bodies, and, far from contradicting any\ncommitments about mind-body relations made in Part 2, the doctrine of\nthe eternity of the mind in Part 5 arguably brings to light the full\nmeaning of those earlier commitments.\n\nTo recall (2.2.1), in Part 2 Spinoza proposes that the \u201cfirst\nthing\u201d that constitutes this \u201cactual being\u201d of a\nhuman mind is an idea of an \u201cactually exist[ing]\u201d body\n(E2p11\u201313). Only in Part 5 does Spinoza clarify that\n\u201cactual\u201d being or existence can be understood in two ways:\nfirst, in the temporal or durational sense key to the claims made in\nPart 2, and second, in an atemporal or purely ontological sense of\nsimply having being or reality at all (as opposed to, for example,\nbeing merely possible):\n\nWe conceive things as actual in two ways: either insofar as we\nconceive them to exist in relation to a certain time and place, or\ninsofar as we conceive them to be contained in God and to follow from\nthe necessity of the divine nature. But the things we conceive in this\nsecond way as true, or real, we conceive under a species of\neternity (E5p29s)\n\n\nGiven these two senses of \u201cactuality\u201d, Spinoza\u2019s\noriginal claim in Part 2 that the \u201cactual being\u201d of the\nhuman mind is an idea of an \u201cactually exist[ing]\u201d body can\nalso be understood in two ways. First, it can be understood as a claim\nabout what it takes for a human mind to begin existing in\ntime, as we have done in 2.2.1: any human mind starts to\nactually exist in a durational sense when the nexus of bodily causes\nin nature generates a new body, which then begins to be variously\naffected or changed by external causes. The infinite intellect, in its\nindefatigable omniscience, begins to represent these affections or\nchanges. The relevant \u201cpart\u201d of God\u2019s omniscient\nidea (see 2.1.2) is a new, temporally existing human mind. More\nplainly put, a human \u201cinfant\u201d is born, with \u201ca body\ncapable of very few things, and\u2026a mind\u2026conscious of\nalmost nothing\u201d (E5p39s).\n\nThis is the first, more intuitive sense in which human minds can be\nsaid to \u201cactually exist\u201d, the sense in which your mind\nexists now when processing these words. But however much we may be\nattached to our temporal selves and all that they feel, for Spinoza\nthere is another sense of \u201cactual existence\u201d. In that\nsecond sense, a human mind is still essentially an \u201cactually\nexisting\u201d idea of a certain \u201cactually existing\u201d bit\nof extension. But the relevant bit of extension is not the living\nhuman body, but its eternal essence \u2013 a certain\neternally possible way that divine extension can modify itself to take\non a certain ratio of motion and rest (cf. E2def[8]; G/II/100), i.e., a\ncertain determinate functional pattern of physical activity. In its\nomniscience, the divine substance eternally understands itself as\nbeing capable of being modified in such more determinate ways \u2013\nthat is, of manifesting its own physical being as this or that snail\nor sunflower or human infant. Ideas of these eternal bodily\nessences are eternal \u201cparts\u201d of substance\u2019s\ninfinite intellect (E2p8). That is, for each bodily essence there is a\ndivine idea that \u201cexpresses the essence of the body under a\nspecies of eternity\u201d (E5p23s), as an eternal part of the\ninfinite intellect.\n\nThe eternal idea of a bodily essence is not only a part of God\u2019s\nintellect (as all ideas are), it is also an eternal \u201cpart\u201d\nof the relevant human mind, a \u201cpart\u201d that\n\u201cremains\u201d (E5p23) even after the body\u2019s demise, when\nthere are no more ideas of bodily affections to be \u201cfelt\u201d.\nThis then is all there is also to human immortality, in\nSpinoza\u2019s view: the eternal existence of the essences of our\nbodies, and of ideas of those bodies. As Nadler emphasizes (2002), we\nare far here from any traditional doctrine of personal immortality:\nnothing that does not belong to us essentially, and nothing that\ndepends on sense experience, such as memories, persists beyond\ndeath.\n\nSpinoza attaches an epistemic challenge to this ontological\npicture. He writes that we always \u201cunderstand\u201d and\n\u201cfeel\u201d \u201cthat we are eternal\u201d (E5p23s):\npresumably this means that we have some joyful, i.e., empowering\n(E3p11d), intellectual grasp of our own eternity (even if we often\njoin these adequate ideas with inadequate ones [see 3.2.2], such as\nreward or punishment). But he also suggests, prima\nfacie puzzlingly, that we can increase the degree of our own\neternity: \u201cthe more the mind understands things by the second\nand third kind of cognition, the greater the part [maxima\npars] of it that remains\u201d after the destruction of the body\n(E5p38d). This suggestion might seem puzzling if we assume that the\n\u201ceternal part\u201d of my mind is just the eternal\nidea of the eternal essence of my own body. For then there\nseems to be nothing that would be subject to improvement or\nenlargement: my eternal essence just is my eternal essence.\n\nBut arguably this is not how Spinoza understands the eternal part of\nthe mind. The idea of the eternal essence of the body is just the\n\u201cfirst thing [primum]\u201d (cf. E2p11) that grounds\nmy mind\u2019s eternal existence: it is the foundation of\neternal ideas of other things, just as the durational idea of this\nbody as changing is the foundation of imaginative ideas of other\nthings. \u201c[T]he Mind is eternal, insofar as it conceives things\nunder a species of eternity\u201d (E5p31s). Since for Spinoza any\nhuman mind is essentially an idea of a certain \u201cactually\nexisting\u201d body, cognition of that body is the foundation of\nall cognition whatsoever. This is true whether we are talking\nabout imaginative cognition of the external bodies we bump up against\nin duration; or about intellectual cognition of eternally existing\nessences: \u201cWhatever the mind understands under a species of\neternity, it understands\u2026from the fact that it conceives the\nbody\u2019s essence under a species of eternity\u201d (E5p29). In\nshort, for Spinoza all cognition of eternal truths rests on a\ncognition of our own body as an eternal essence. We can thus\nunderstand the idea of enlarging or maximizing the eternal\n\u201cpart\u201d of our minds in terms of the number of eternal\ntruths, intuitive and rational, that we can acquire in the course of\nour existence \u2013 or, as on innatist readings (see 3.1), the\nnumber of eternal truths that we can make into powerful\n\u201cparts\u201d of our minds.\n\n(On consciousness, see 2.3; on imaginative cognition of the body see\n2.2 and 3.2.2.
