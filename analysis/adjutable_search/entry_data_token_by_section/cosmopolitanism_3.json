Taxonomy of Contemporary Cosmopolitanisms\n\n\nEven this brief glance backwards reveals a wide variety of views that\ncan be called cosmopolitan. Every cosmopolitan argues for some\ncommunity among all human beings, regardless of social and political\naffiliation. For some, what should be shared is simply moral\ncommunity, which means only that living a good human life requires\nserving the universal community by helping human beings as such,\nperhaps by promoting the realization of justice and the guarantee of\nhuman rights.  Others conceptualize the universal community in terms\nof political institutions to be shared by all, in terms of cultural\nexpressions that can be shared or appreciated by all, or in terms of\neconomic markets that should be open to all. \n\n\nThe most common cosmopolitanism \u2013 moral cosmopolitanism\n\u2013 does not always call itself such. But just as ancient\ncosmopolitanism was fundamentally a \u2018moral\u2019 commitment to\nhelping human beings as such, much contemporary moral philosophy\ninsists on the duty to aid foreigners who are starving or otherwise\nsuffering, or at least on the duty to respect and promote basic human\nrights and justice.\u00a0 One can here distinguish between strict and\nmoderate forms of cosmopolitanism. The strict cosmopolitans\nin this sphere operate sometimes from utilitarian assumptions (e.g.,\nSinger, Unger), sometimes from Kantian assumptions (e.g., O\u2019Neill),\nand sometimes from more ancient assumptions (e.g., Nussbaum), but\nalways with the claim that the duty to provide aid neither gets\nweighed against any extra duty to help locals or compatriots nor\nincreases in strength when locals or compatriots are in\nquestion. Among these strict cosmopolitans some will say that it is\npermissible, at least in some situations, to concentrate one\u2019s\ncharitable efforts on one\u2019s compatriots, while others deny this\n\u2013 their position will depend on the details of their moral\ntheory. Other philosophers whom we may call moderate\ncosmopolitans (including, e.g., Scheffler) acknowledge the\ncosmopolitan scope of a duty to provide aid, but insist that we also\nhave special duties to compatriots. Among the moderate cosmopolitans,\nmany further distinctions can be drawn, depending on the reasons that\nare admitted for recognizing special responsibilities to compatriots\nand depending on how the special responsibilities are balanced with\nthe cosmopolitan duties to human beings generally.\n\n\nMoral cosmopolitanism has sometimes led to political\ncosmopolitanism. Again, we can draw useful distinctions among the\npolitical cosmopolitans. Some advocate a centralized world state, some\nfavor a federal system with a comprehensive global body of limited\ncoercive power, some would prefer international political institutions\nthat are limited in scope and focus on particular concerns (e.g., war\ncrimes, environmental preservation), and some defend a different\nalternative altogether. Prominent philosophical discussions of\ninternational political arrangements have recently clustered around\nthe heirs of Kant (e.g., Habermas, Rawls, Beitz, and Pogge) and around\nadvocates of \u2018cosmopolitan democracy\u2019 (e.g., Held) or\n\u2018republican cosmopolitanism\u2019 (Bohman 2001, Laborde 2010, Pettit 2010, 2016).\n\n\nA number of theorists have objected to the focus, in much of the\ndebate over political cosmopolitanism, on the role of states. In their\nview, a genuinely cosmopolitan theory should address the needs and\ninterests of human individuals directly \u2013 as world\ncitizens \u2013 instead of indirectly, as state citizens, that is via\ntheir membership in particular states. What is needed instead is a\ntheory that focuses not merely on the moral duties of individuals or\non the political relations among states, but on the justice of social\ninstitutions world-wide and the measures required to attain it. This\n\u2018cosmopolitan\u2019 position in the debate over global\ndistributive justice, is especially critical of what they see as\nJohn Rawls\u2019 privileging of the interests of states over those of\nindividuals, in his Theory of Justice as well as in his\nsubsequent Law of Peoples. In order to establish principles\nof global justice, Rawls should have applied his famous thought\nexperiment of the \u2018original position\u2019 at the global level\nof all human individuals, they charge, instead of arguing, as Rawls\ndoes, for a second original position, one that involves\nrepresentatives of all \u2018peoples\u2019. The debate between Rawls\nand his cosmopolitan critics points to the issue of the proper role\nand status of states: are they indispensable instruments in the\npursuit of justice (ideally embodying the principle of the democratic\nself-determination of peoples), or are they rather inimical to it,\nbecause they entrench state interests at the expense of individuals in\nneed?\n\n\nFurthermore, there has been a good deal of debate\nover cultural cosmopolitanism, with disputes over\nmulticulturalism in educational curricula and with resurgent\nnationalisms. The cosmopolitan position in these\ndisputes rejects exclusive attachments to a particular culture. So on\nthe one hand, the cosmopolitan encourages cultural diversity and\nappreciates a multicultural m\u00e9lange, and on the other hand, the\ncosmopolitan rejects a strong nationalism. In staking out these\nclaims, the cosmopolitan must be wary about very strong \u2018rights\nto culture,\u2019 respecting the rights of minority cultures while\nrebuffing the right to unconditional national\nself-determination. Hence, recent advocates of \u2018liberal\nnationalism\u2019 (e.g., Margalit and Raz, Tamir) or of the rights of\nminority cultures (e.g., Kymlicka) generally seem to be\nanti-cosmopolitan. But the cosmopolitan\u2019s wariness towards very strong\nrights to culture and towards national self-determination need not be\ngrounded in a wholesale skepticism about the importance of particular\ncultural attachments. Cosmopolitanism can acknowledge the importance\nof (at least some kinds of) cultural attachments for the good human\nlife (at least within certain limits), while denying that this implies\nthat a person\u2019s cultural identity should be defined by any bounded or\nhomogeneous subset of the cultural resources available in the world\n(e.g., Waldron).\n\nEconomic cosmopolitanism is perhaps less often defended\namong philosophers and more often among economists (e.g., Hayek,\nFriedman) and certain politicians, especially in the richer countries\nof this world. It is the view that one ought to cultivate a single\nglobal economic market with free trade and minimal political\ninvolvement. It tends to be criticized rather than advanced by\nphilosophical cosmopolitans, as many of them regard it as at least a\npartial cause of the problem of vast international economic inequality.\nThese debates about the desirability of a fully globalized market have\nintensified in recent years, as a result of the end of the Cold War and\nthe increasing reach of the market economy.\n",
