Polemical Works: Status of Reason, Liberty, Law\n\nAs Stephen Greenblatt indicated in his influential 1980 study of\nRenaissance self-fashioning, the \u201cprinciple of\nintelligibility\u201d is a major topic in More studies (63;\n24\u201325, 59). More posed serious epistemological issues in\nquestioning how we know\u2014early on, for example, he questioned how\nLuther knows what he knows. In his first polemical work,\n\u201crequest[ed] by the king and court\u201d (1523 Response to\nLuther [CW 5: 791]), More created the persona of an\neasily-angered, common-sense English lawyer who questions Luther in\nthe following way.\n\n\n\u2026 [W]e ask of him: \u201cBy what reason, Father, do you prove\nthat you alone must be believed?\u201d\n\nTo this he returns this cause: \u201cBecause I am certain\u201d, he\nsays, \u201cthat I have my teachings from heaven\u201d.\n\nAgain we ask: \u201cBy what reason are you certain that you have your\nteachings from heaven?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause God has seized me unawares\u201d, he says, \u201cand\ncarried me into the midst of these turmoils\u201d.\n\nAgain therefore we demand: \u201cHow do you know that God has seized\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am certain\u201d, he says, \u201cthat my teaching\nis from God\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause God has seized me\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am certain\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow are you certain?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I know\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut how do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am certain\u201d.\n\nI ask you, reader, whether that form of disputing does not find a\nplace here\u2026. (1523 Response to Luther [EW\n517.31\u201353])\n\n\nHere in this 1523 text, as he would do later in all of his polemical\nworks, More regularly addresses his readers and asks them to judge for\nthemselves\u2014in light of reason and in light of an international\nagreement achieved through 1500 years of conciliar and scholarly\ndeliberation.\n\nMore also addressed directly Luther\u2019s early claims that\n\u201creason hindereth us in our faith, and is unto faith an\nenemy\u201d (1529 Dialogue of Sir Thomas More, Knight\n[EW 698.23\u201324]) and that a spiritual elect had\nindependence from all governors and from all civil and ecclesiastical\nlaws (1523 Response to Luther [EW 510\u201311,\n522\u201323], 1529 Dialogue [EW 698\u201399]).\nMore saw these claims as undermining what he, Erasmus, and others saw\nas the path to lasting reform of both church and state: improved\neducation resulting in better laws. More pointed out the danger of\ndenying free will and teaching that it is \u201cvain\u201d to resist\n\u201csinful appetites\u201d (1529 Dialogue [EW\n703.42])\u2014advice that countered the view of virtue that both the\nclassical and the biblical traditions shared. If human beings are not\nresponsible for their actions, then Luther\u2019s \u201cliberty of\nthe gospel\u201d is, for More, \u201cunbridled license\u201d\n(Response to Luther, Book 1 [CW 5: 271.4\u20135])\nand a sure path to lawlessness and violence (Response to Luther,\nBook 2 [CW 5: 689\u201391]).\n\nFor More, law was itself the product of collective reason over time.\nHe gives one of his clearest explanations of law after quoting a long\ndefense of law by Henry VIII, who invoked Scripture, the Church\nFathers, and history to prove that \u201cthe people without law\ndrifts to and fro like a ship without a rudder\u201d (1523\nResponse to Luther [EW 508\u20139], quoting\nHenry\u2019s Defense of the Seven Sacraments). More then\ncompares the biblical law against stealing with human laws about\nprivate property. If no one owned anything, there would be no theft,\nhe observed. But \u201creason alone prescribe[s] the forms of\ndetermining property\u201d together with \u201can agreement, and\nthis a public agreement \u2026 taking root in usage or expressed in\nwriting [which] is public law\u201d (EW 510.39\u201344).\nLuther\u2019s undermining the status of law\u2014biblical and\ncivic\u2014is, More insists,\n\n\nin opposition to the judgment of all learned men, in opposition to the\njudgment of all good men, in opposition to the public agreement of the\nwhole world. (EW 511.15\u201318)\n\n\nYet realist that he was, More cites Plutarch, \u201cthe great moral\nphilosopher\u201d (EW 501.23), in recognizing that laws\ncan\n\n\nbe much like \u2026 cobwebs, in which the little gnats and flies\nstick still and hang fast, but the great [bumble]-bees break them and\nfly quite through. (1534 Dialogue of Comfort [EW\n1209.41\u201344]; see Plutarch, Life of Solon 5)\n\n\nIn his second major polemical work, published in 1529 in response to\nthe bishop of London\u2019s request (7 March 1527/8 letter from\nBishop Tunstall [EW 351]), More countered Luther\u2019s and\nTyndale\u2019s criticisms of philosophy and the role of reason by\narguing that reason plays an essential role, but it must be a\nwell-trained reason within a well-tempered body and soul (1534\nDialogue of Comfort [EW 1238.34], 1535 Sadness\nof Christ [EW 1260.31ff]). Without a proper order or\n\u201cgood temper\u201d of the soul, More maintained that reason\n\u201cwill not fail to fall in rebellion\u201d. Elsewhere he\nregularly used the classical image of training the powerful horses of\nthe soul with bridle and bit if they are ever to be happy and\nserviceable (EW 15.271, 26.15\u201336, 577.1\u20132,\n580.83, 581.54, 584.69\u201371, 1101.56, 1232.71\u201372,\n1350.46\u201347). The bodily appetites must be tempered so that the\nspiritual appetites can flourish (EW 1242\u201343).\n\nArguing further for the essential role of reason, More goes on to show\nits role in the interpretation of Scripture:\n\n\n\u201cNow, in the study of Scripture\u2014in devising upon the\nsentence, in considering what ye read, in pondering the purpose of\ndiverse comments, in comparing together diverse texts that seem\ncontrary and be not\u2014albeit I deny not but that grace and\nGod\u2019s especial help is the great thing therein, yet useth he for\nan instrument man\u2019s reason thereto. God helpeth us to eat, also,\nbut yet not without our mouth. Now as the hand is the more nimble by\nthe use of some feats, and the legs and feet more swift and sure by\ncustom of going and running, and the whole body the more wieldy and\nlusty by some kind of exercise, so is it no doubt but that reason is\nby study, labor, and exercise of logic, philosophy, and other liberal\narts, corroborated and quickened, and the judgment\u2014both in them\nand also in orators, laws, and stories\u2014much riped. And albeit\npoets be with many men taken but for painted words, yet do they much\nhelp the judgment, and make a man, among other things, well furnished\nof one special thing, without which all learning is half\nlame.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d quoth he.\n\n\u201cMarry\u201d, quoth I, \u201ca good mother wit. And therefore\nare, in mine opinion, these Lutherans in a mad mind, that would now\nhave all learning save Scripture only clean cast away, which things\n(if the time will serve) be as methinketh to be taken and had, and\nwith reason brought, as I said before, into the service of\ndivinity\u201d. (1529 Dialogue [EW\n581.4\u201333])\n\n\nAs shown in this passage, More considered a mind that does not\nrecognize the necessary role of a well-trained reason in human life to\nbe mad.\n\nHe was consistent throughout his life in presenting the\ncomplementarity of reason and revelation:\n\n\n[R]eason hath no full and perfect instruction without help of\nrevelation. For not only in things only to be believed, but in many\nthings also that are to be done [or] left undone, for anything that\nreason can tell either them or us, we be fain [i.e., glad] to seek the\ncertainty of revelation. (The Confutation of Tyndale\u2019s\nAnswer [CW 8: 996.3\u20138])\n\n\nAs the More scholar Joanne Paul has argued, the problem as More saw it\nwas that Luther removes \u201cthe authority of judging doctrines from\nthe people and delivers it to anyone whatever\u201d, that is,\n\u201cfrom the people, as a corporate whole, to single\nindividuals\u201d. This is\n\n\nespecially problematic in that it encourages pride in others, telling\nthem that they too have the power to interpret scripture according to\ntheir own judgement\u2026. As More says, now \u201cevery prattling\nfool, every smatterer in scripture, shall be judge over all the\ngeneral councils, and over the whole corps of Christendom, to tell\nthem all that himself understandeth the scripture better than they\nall\u201d. (98\u201399; see also Guy 2017: 41; Duffy 2017:\n36\u201337)\n\n\nIn his longest polemical work, More satirizes what Tyndale calls his\n\u201cfeeling faith\u201d by contrasting it with the consent and\nagreement achieved by international \u201csynods and counsels\u201d\nthat \u201crepresent the whole Church\u201d (Confutation\n[CW 8: 146, 8, 16]). Over 170 times More shows how the\n\u201cfeeling faith\u201d of\n\n\nLuther, Tyndale, and Zwingli, \u2026 and his fellows, goes against\nthe interpretation of all holy doctors and saints, and the common\nfaith of all true Christian people, fifteen hundred years before them.\n(CW 8: 157.11\u201314)\n\n\nHere More continues to use his favorite technique of irony in a manner\nreminiscent of his calling the murderous Richard the\n\u201cProtector\u201d almost 100 times in his History of King\nRichard III.\n",
