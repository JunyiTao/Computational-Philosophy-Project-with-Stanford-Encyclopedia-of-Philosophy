    "main_text": "Understanding Constructive Empiricism || Empirical Adequacy\n1.5 Empirical Adequacy\n\nHere is a rough-and-ready characterization of what it is for a theory\nto be empirically adequate:\n\na theory is empirically adequate exactly if what it says about the\nobservable things and events in the world is true\u2014exactly if it\n\u2018saves the phenomena.\u2019 (van Fraassen 1980, 12)\n\n\nA sufficiently unreflective constructive empiricist might adopt this\nconstrual of empirical adequacy for her theory, but a more\nsophisticated constructive empiricist would probably embrace an\naccount of empirical adequacy akin to that which van Fraassen develops\nlater in The Scientific Image. \n\nTo understand that account, one needs first to appreciate the\ndifference between the syntactic view of scientific theories\nand van Fraassen\u2019s preferred semantic view of\nscientific theories. On the syntactic view, a theory is given by an\nenumeration of theorems, expressed in some one particular language. In\ncontrast, on the semantic view, a theory is given by the specification\nof a class of structures (describable in various languages) that are\nthe theory\u2019s models (the determinate structures of which the\ntheory holds true). As van Fraassen says,\n\nTo present a theory is to specify a family of structures, its models;\nand secondly, to specify certain parts of those models (the empirical\nsubstructures) as candidates for the direct representation of\nobservable phenomena. (1980, 64)\n\n\nA theory is empirically adequate, then, if\nappearances\u2014\u201cthe structures which can be described in\nexperimental and measurement reports\u201d (1980, 64)\u2014are\nisomorphic to the empirical substructures of some model of the theory.\nRoughly speaking, the theory is empirically adequate if the observable\nphenomena can \u201cfind a home\u201d within the structures\ndescribed by the theory\u2014that is to say, the observable phenomena\ncan be \u201cembedded\u201d in the theory. See Figure 1 for a\ngraphical illustration of the relations that make a theory empirically\nadequate on van Fraassen\u2019s view, with the cloud shapes\nrepresenting the relata of the isomorphism relation.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. A Theory\u2019s Empirical Adequacy\n\n\nThis conception of a theory\u2019s empirical adequacy is arguably\nwhat allows a constructive empiricist to avoid the kind of doxastic\ncommitment Friedman (1982, 278) and Rochefort-Maranda (2011,\n61\u201362) describe as posing a problem for the constructive\nempiricist (a problem that Rochefort-Maranda subsequently attempts to\nsolve). Here is that problem:\n\nSince we might initially think that sentences about observables are,\naccording to a theory, equivalent to certain sentences about\nunobservable entities, we might also think that commitment to belief\nin the existence of the observables undesirably commits the\nconstructive empiricist to the existence of the corresponding\nunobservable entities. (And so correspondingly, agnosticism about the\nunobservables undesirably commits the constructive empiricist to\nagnosticism about the equivalent observables.)\n\n\nThe constructive empiricist arguably dissolves this problem by\ninvoking the above conception of empirical adequacy.\n(Rochefort-Maranda gestures in the direction of, but does not\nexplicitly describe, this dissolution in his footnote 1.) Belief that\na theory is empirically adequate amounts to the belief that the\nobservables can be properly embedded in at least one of the\ntheory\u2019s models. Belief in the possibility of that embedding\ndoes not require the constructive empiricist to take the truth of\nsentences about observables to entail the truth of sentences about\nunobservables. By taking a theory to be empirically adequate, the\nconstructive empiricist is simply saying that the phenomena we observe\n(and believe to exist) can exist within the structure the theory\ndescribes, without additionally being committed to saying that the\nunobservable parts of that theoretical structure are parts of the\nactual structure of the world.\n\nNote that the phenomena relevant to a theory\u2019s empirical\nadequacy are all actual observable phenomena (1980, 12). So\nfor a theory to be empirically adequate, it has to be able to account\nfor more than just the phenomena that have actually been observed and\nthe phenomena that will be observed. See Section 3.4 below for a\ndiscussion of the worry that the constructive empiricist\u2019s\nbelief in the empirical adequacy of her accepted theories thereby\nextends beyond what a bona fide empiricist ought to believe.\n",
