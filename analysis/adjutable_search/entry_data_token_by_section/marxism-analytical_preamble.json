    "main_text": "\n\nAnalytical Marxism is a predominantly Anglophone variety\nof Marxism that emerged in the late 1970s, and whose leading\nproponents are located in philosophy and social science departments in\nUS and European universities. It can be distinguished from certain\nclassical forms of Marxism by its openness to analytical methods, its\ncritical attitude to certain substantive Marxist claims, its\nacknowledgement of its own normative commitments, and its assertion of\nthe need for socialist design.\n",
