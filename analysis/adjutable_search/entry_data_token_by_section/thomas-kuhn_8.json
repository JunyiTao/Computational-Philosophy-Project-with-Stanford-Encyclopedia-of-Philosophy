    "main_text": "History of Science\n5. History of Science\n Kuhn\u2019s historical work covered several topics in the history of\nphysics and astronomy. During the 1950s his focus was primarily on the\nearly theory of heat and the work of Sadi Carnot. However, his first\nbook concerned the Copernican revolution in planetary astronomy\n(1957). This book grew out of the teaching he had done on James\nConant\u2019s General Education in Science curriculum at Harvard but also\npresaged some of the ideas of The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions. In detailing the problems with the Ptolemaic system\nand Copernicus\u2019 solution to them, Kuhn showed two things. First,\nhe demonstrated that Aristotelian science was genuine science and that\nthose working within that tradition, in particular those working on\nPtolemaic astronomy, were engaged in an entirely reasonable and\nrecognizably scientific project. Secondly, Kuhn showed that Copernicus\nwas himself far more indebted to that tradition than had typically\nbeen recognized. Thus the popular view that Copernicus was a modern\nscientist who overthrew an unscientific and long-outmoded viewpoint is\nmistaken both by exaggerating the difference between Copernicus and\nthe Ptolemaic astronomers and in underestimating the scientific\ncredentials of work carried out before Copernicus. This mistaken\nview\u2014a product of the distortion caused by our current state of\nknowledge\u2014can be rectified only by seeing the activities of\nCopernicus and his predecessors in the light of the puzzles presented\nto them by tradition that they inevitably had to work with. While Kuhn\ndoes acknowledge the influence of causes outside science (such as a\nresurgence in Sun worship (1962/70a, 152\u20133)), he nonetheless\nemphasizes the fact that astronomers were responding primarily to\nproblems raised within science. What appealed to them in\nCopernicus\u2019 model was its ability to do away with ad hoc devices\nin Ptolemy\u2019s system (such as the equant), to explain key phenomena in\na pleasing fashion (the observed retrograde motion of the planets),\nand to explain away otherwise inexplicable coincidences in Ptolemy\u2019s\nsystem (such as the alignment of the Sun and the centres of the\nepicycles of the inferior planets).\nIn the 1960s Kuhn\u2019s historical work turned toward the early history\nof quantum theory, culminating in his book Black-Body Theory and\nthe Quantum Discontinuity. According to classical physics a\nparticle could possess any energy in a continuous range and if it\nchanges energy it does so in a continuous fashion, possessing at some\npoint in time every energy between the initial and final energy\nstates. Modern quantum theory denies both these classical\nprinciples. Energy is quantised\u2014a particle may possess only one\nof a set of discrete energies. Consequently if it changes in energy\nfrom one value to the next permitted value it does so discontinuously,\njumping straight from one energy to the other without taking any of\nthe intermediate (\u2018forbidden\u2019) values. In order to explain\nthe distribution of energy within a cavity (black-body radiation),\nPlanck used the device of dividing up the energy states into multiples\nof the unit or \u2018quantum\u2019 h\u03bd (where \u03bd is the\nfrequency of radiation and h is what subsequently became\nknown as Planck\u2019s constant). Planck did this in order to employ a\nstatistical technique of Boltzmann\u2019s whereby the range of possible\ncontinuous energies is divided into \u2018cells\u2019 of\nsimilar energies that could be treated together for mathematical\npurposes. Kuhn notes that Planck was puzzled that in carrying out his\nderivation, only by fixing the cell size at h\u03bd could he\nget the result he wanted\u2014the technique should have worked for any\nway of dividing the cells, so long as they were small enough but not\ntoo small. This work of Planck\u2019s was carried out in the period 1900\u20131,\nwhich is the date tradition has accorded to the invention of the\nquantum concept. However, argued Kuhn, Planck did not have in mind a\ngenuine physical discontinuity of energies until 1908, which is after\nAlbert Einstein and Paul Ehrenfest had themselves emphasized it in\n1905\u20136.\n Many readers were surprised not to find mention of paradigms or\nincommensurability. Kuhn later added an Afterword, \u201cRevisiting\nPlanck\u201d, explaining that he had not repudiated or ignored those\nideas but that they were implicit in the argument he gave. Indeed the\nwhole essay may be seen as a demonstration of an incommensurability\nbetween the mature quantum theory and the early quantum theory of\nPlanck which was still rooted in classical statistical physics. In\nparticular the very term \u2018quantum\u2019 changed its meaning\nbetween its introduction by Planck and its later use. Kuhn argues that\nthe modern quantum concept was introduced first not by Planck but by\nEinstein. Furthermore, this fact is hidden both by the continued use\nof the same term and by the same distortion of history that has\naffected our conception of Ptolemy and Copernicus. As in\nCopernicus\u2019 case, Planck has been seen as more revolutionary\nthan in fact he was. In Planck\u2019s case, however, this misconception was\nalso shared by Planck himself later in life.\n",
