    "main_text": "Moral Judgment and Motivation\n3. Moral Judgment and Motivation\n\nPhilosophers have most often attempted to explain moral motivation not\nby appealing to the special powers of moral properties but by\nappealing to the nature of moral judgments. Perhaps moral\njudgments are such that no person could sincerely judge an act morally\nright or a state of affairs good, while remaining wholly\nunmoved. Efforts to understand moral motivation in terms of motivation\nby moral judgments must confront two central questions. First, what is\nthe nature of the connection between moral judgment and\nmotivation\u2014do moral judgments motivate necessarily or\ndo they motivate only contingently? Second, can moral\njudgments motivate on their own or can they motivate only by the\nintermediation of a desire or other conative state? Of course,\nphilosophers have answered these questions in varying ways.\n",
