    "main_text": "Some related terms || Resistance to facts\n6.2 Resistance to facts\n\nUnwillingness to accept strongly supported factual statements is a\ntraditional criterion of pseudoscience. (See for instance item 5 on\nthe list of seven criteria cited in Section 4.6.) The term \u201cfact\nresistance\u201d or \u201cresistance to facts\u201d was used\nalready in the 1990s, for instance by Arthur Krystal (1999, p. 8), who\ncomplained about a \u201cgrowing resistance to facts\u201d,\nconsisting in people being \u201csimply unrepentant about not knowing\nthings that do not reflect their interests\u201d. The term\n\u201cfact resistance\u201d can refer to unwillingness to accept\nwell-supported factual claims whether or not that support originates\nin science. It is particularly useful in relation to fact-finding\npractices that are not parts of science. (Cf. Section 2.)\n",
