    "main_text": "Algebras || Varieties and quasivarieties\n4.2 Varieties and quasivarieties\n\nThe majority of classes of algebras that provide semantics for\npropositional logics are quasivarieties and in most cases varieties.\nThe theory of varieties and quasivarieties is one of the main subjects\nof universal algebra.\n\nAn equational class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of \\(L\\)-algebras\nthat is definable in a very simple way (by\nequations) using the \\(L\\)-algebraic language. An \\(L\\)-equation\nis a formula \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\)\nwhere \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are terms of the \\(L\\)-algebraic\nlanguage (that is, \\(L\\)-formulas\nif we take the propositional logic's point of\nview) and '\\(\\approx\\)' is the formal symbol for the equality (always to be interpreted as the identity relation). An equation \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\) is valid in an\nalgebra \\(\\bA\\), or \\(\\bA\\) is a model of \\(\\phi \\approx\n\\psi\\), if for every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA,\n\\bv(\\phi) = \\bv(\\psi)\\). This is exactly the same as to saying that\nthe universal closure of \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\) is a sentence true in\n\\(\\bA\\) according to the usual semantics for first-order logic with\nequality. An equational class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a\nclass of \\(L\\)-algebras which is the class of all the\nmodels of a given set of \\(L\\)-equations.\nA quasi-equational class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of \\(L\\)-algebras definable using the \\(L\\)-algebraic language in a slightly more complex way than in equational.classes. A proper \\(L\\)-quasiequation is a formula of the form \\[\\bigwedge_{i \\le n} \\phi_i \\approx \\psi_i \\rightarrow \\phi \\approx \\psi.\\] An \\(L\\)-quasiequation is a formula of the above form but possibly with an empty antecedent, in which case it is just the equation \\(\\phi \\approx \\psi\\). Hence, the \\(L\\)-quasiequations are the proper \\(L\\)-quasiequations and the \\(L\\)-equations. An \\(L\\)-quasiequation is valid in an \\(L\\)-algebra \\(\\bA\\), or the algebra is a model of it, if the universal closure of the quasiequation is sentence true in \\(\\bA\\). A quasi-equational class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of algebras that is the class of the models of a given set of \\(L\\)-quasiequations. Since equations are quasiequations, every equational class  is quasi-equational. The converse is false. Moreover, since in the trivial algebras all the equations and all the quasiequations of the appropriate algebraic language are valid, equational and  quasi-equational classes are nonempty. \n\nEquational and quasi-equational classes of algebras  can be characterized by the closure\nproperties they enjoy. A nonempty class of \\(L\\)-algebras\nis a variety if  it is closed\nunder subalgebras, direct products, and homomorphic images. It is   a quasivariety  \nif it is closed under subalgebras, direct products, ultraproducts,\nisomorphic images, and contains a trivial algebra. It is easily seen that equational classes are varieties and that quasi-equational classes are quasiviarities. Birkhoff's theorem states that all varieties are equational classes and Malcev's theorem that all quasivarieties are quasi-equational classes. \n\n The\nvariety generated by a nonempty class \\(\\bK\\) of \\(L\\)-algebras\nis the least class of \\(L\\)-algebras\nthat includes \\(\\bK\\) and is closed under\nsubalgebras, direct products and homomorphic images. It is also the\nclass of the algebras that are models of the equations valid in\n\\(\\bK\\). For example, the variety generated by the algebra of the two\ntruth-values for classical logic is the class of Boolean algebras. If\nwe restrict that algebra to the operations for conjunction and\ndisjunction only, it generates the variety of distributive lattices\nand if we restrict it to the operations for conjunction and\ndisjunction and the interpretations of \\(\\top\\) and \\(\\bot\\), it\ngenerates the variety of bounded distributive lattices.\n The quasivariety\ngenerated by a class \\(\\bK\\) of \\(L\\)-algebras is the\nleast class of \\(L\\)-algebras that includes \\(\\bK\\),\nthe trivial algebras and is closed under subalgebras, direct products,\nultraproducts, and isomorphic images.\n\nAn SP-class of \\(L\\)-algebras is a class of\n\\(L\\)-algebras that contains a trivial algebra and is\nclosed under isomorphic images, subalgebras, and direct products. Thus\nquasivarieties and varieties are all SP-classes. The SP-class\ngenerated by a class \\(\\bK\\) of \\(L\\)-algebras is the\nleast class of \\(L\\)-algebras that includes \\(\\bK\\),\nthe trivial algebras and is closed under subalgebras, direct products\nand isomorphic images.\n",
