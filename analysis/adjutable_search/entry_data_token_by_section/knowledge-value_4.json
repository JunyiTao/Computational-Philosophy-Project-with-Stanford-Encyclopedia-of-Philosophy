    "main_text": "The Value of Knowledge-How\n5. The Value of Knowledge-How\n\nThe received view in mainstream epistemology, at least since Gilbert\nRyle (e.g., 1949), has been to regard knowledge-that and knowledge-how\nas different epistemic standings, such that knowing how to do\nsomething is not simply a matter of knowing propositions, viz., of\nknowledge-that. If this view\u2014known as\nanti-intellectualism\u2014is correct, then the value of\nknowledge-how needn\u2019t be accounted for in terms of the value of\nknowing propositions. Furthermore, if anti-intellectualism is assumed,\nthen\u2014to the extent that there is any analogous \u2018value\nproblem\u2019 for knowledge-how\u2014such a problem needn\u2019t\nmaterialize as the philosophical problem of determining what it is\nabout knowledge-how that makes it more valuable than mere true\nbelief.\n\nJason Stanley & Timothy Williamson (2001) have, however,\ninfluentially resisted the received anti-intellectualist thinking\nabout knowledge-how. On Stanley & Williamson\u2019s\nview\u2014intellectualism\u2014knowledge-how is a kind of\npropositional knowledge, i.e., knowledge-that, such that\n(roughly) S knows how to \u03c6 iff there is a way w\nsuch that S knows that w is a way for S to\n\u03c6. Accordingly, if Hannah knows how to ride a bike, then this is\nin virtue of her propositional knowledge\u2014viz., her knowing of\nsome way w that w is the way for her (Hannah) to\nride a bike.\n\nBy reducing in this manner knowledge\u2014how to a kind of\nknowledge\u2014that, intellectualists such as Stanley have accepted\nthat knowledge-how should have properties characteristic of\npropositional knowledge, (see, for example, Stanley 2011: 215), of\nwhich knowledge-how is a kind. Furthermore, the value of knowledge-how\nshould be able to be accounted for, on intellectualism, with reference\nto the value of the propositional knowledge that the intellectualist\nidentifies with knowledge-how.\n\nIn recent work, Carter and Pritchard (2015) have challenged\nintellectualism on this point. One such example they offer to this end\ninvolves testimony and skilled action. For example, suppose that a\nskilled guitarist tells an amateur how to play a very tricky guitar\nriff. Carter and Pritchard (2015: 801) argue that though the amateur\ncan uncontroversially acquire testimonial knowledge from the expert\nthat, for some way w that w is the way to play the\nriff, it might be that the expert, but not novice, knows how\nto play the riff. Further, they suggest that whilst the amateur is\nbetter off, with respect to the aim of playing the riff, than he was\nprior to gaining the testimonial knowledge he did, he would likewise\nbe better off further\u2014viz., he would have something even\nmore valuable\u2014if he, like the expert, had the lick down\ncold (something the amateur does not have simply on the basis of his\nacquired testimonial knowledge) (Ibid: 801).\n\nThe conclusion Carter and Pritchard draw from this and other similar\ncases (e.g., 2015: \u00a73; see also Poston 2016) is that the value of\nknowledge-how cannot be accounted for with reference to the value of\nthe items of knowledge-that which the intellectualist identifies with\nknowledge-how If this is right, then if there is a \u2018value\nproblem\u2019 for knowledge-how, we shouldn\u2019t expect it to be\nthe problem of determining what is it about certain items of\npropositional knowledge that makes these more valuable than\ncorresponding mere true beliefs. A potential area for future research\nis to consider what an analogue value problem for knowledge-how might\nlook like, on an anti-intellectualist framework.\n\nAccording to Carter and Pritchard\u2019s diagnosis, the underlying\nexplanation for this difference in value is that knowledge-how (like\nunderstanding, as discussed in\n \u00a74)\n essentially involves a kind of cognitive achievement, unlike\npropositional knowledge, for reasons discussed in \u00a74. If this\ndiagnosis is correct, then further pressure is arguably placed on the\nrobust virtue epistemologist\u2019s \u2018achievement\u2019\nsolution to the value problems for knowledge-that, as surveyed in\n \u00a73.\n Recall that, according to robust virtue epistemology, the distinctive\nvalue of knowledge-that is accounted for in terms of the value of\ncognitive achievement (i.e., success because of ability) which robust\nvirtue epistemologists take to be essential to propositional\nknowledge. But, if the presence of cognitive achievement is what\naccounts for why knowledge-how has a value that is not present in the\nitems of knowledge-that the intellectualist identifies with\nknowledge-how, this result would seem to stand in tension with the\nrobust virtue epistemologist\u2019s insistence that what affords\npropositional knowledge a value lacked by mere true belief is that the\nformer essentially involves cognitive achievement.\n",
