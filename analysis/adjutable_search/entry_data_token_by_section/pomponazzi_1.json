    "main_text": "Writings, Methods, and Interpretative Challenges\n2. Writings, Methods, and Interpretative Challenges\n\nThere are numerous challenges to interpreting the writings of\nPomponazzi. In addition to his writings printed during the sixteenth\ncentury, many reportationes (transcripts) made by listeners\nof his lectures are extant. Due to the nature of their creation, they\npotentially contain errors or are incomplete. At times, they appear to\npresent conflicting views. Filled with witticisms and ironic\nstatements, they reveal insights into Pomponazzi\u2019s popularity as\na lecturer. Adding to the difficulty of interpretation, are\nPomponazzi\u2019s repeated statements of not having solutions to\nphilosophical questions and his promotion of the idea that\nphilosophy teaches the practice of doubting (Perfetti 1999).\nAccordingly, he questioned at times both ecclesiastical authority and\nthe prevailing philosophical environment of Padua and Bologna that was\ncharacterized by Averroism (Hasse 2016: 196).\n\nAn additional impediment in interpreting Pomponazzi stems from his\narguments that he characterized as in naturalibus (based\non nature). Similarly, he at times described himself as following the\nvia peripatetica (the Peripatetic path), which meant\ninvestigating according to Aristotelian principles without influence\nfrom other fields, most prominently theology. Restricting arguments to\nthose that are in naturalibus or following the via\nperipatetica required determining Aristotle\u2019s\nview, regardless of its truth. Pomponazzi justified this approach on\nthe grounds that natural philosophy possesses different principles\nthan theology and therefore those fields should not use the principles\nof other fields. Consequently, at times he maintained that as a lay\nperson he was unable to pronounce on theological questions.\nFurthermore, his duties as professor of philosophy, as in essence a\nprofessional Aristotelian, required him to expound the views of\nAristotle, regardless of their conformity to theological truth.\nThus, he included provisos in On the Immortality of the\nSoul, On Incantations,\nand Apology that stated that his conclusions were\nmerely according to philosophy and that he accepted the determinations\nof the Catholic Church as having a greater degree of authority than\nphilosophy. Some of his contemporaries and later scholars have seen\nthe inclusion of these provisos as being disingenuous, a means to\nprotect himself from prosecution (Renan 1852: 286; Pine 1986: 123).\nBut other scholars have argued for the philosophical coherence of\nhis employment of probable arguments and deference to faith (see\nPerrone Compagni 1999: lxxxv\u2013xcvi). In the thirteenth\ncentury Albertus Magnus had distinguished between investigations\nof nature and the divine, contending that the fields have distinct\nmethods and that revelation disagrees at times with arguments based on\nreason and experience (Martin 2014: 16\u201318). Although at times\nAlbertus\u2019s position was controversial, a number of medieval\nphilosophers endorsed his view. Thus even if Pomponazzi included these\nprovisos as a protective measure, he nevertheless simultaneously\nendorsed a long medieval tradition that held that natural philosophy\nwas separate from theology and that theological truths prevailed over\nphilosophical ones (Bianchi 2008).\n\nPomponazzi used the methods and language typical of the medieval\nscholastic tradition (Kraye 2010), primarily relying on reason and\nexperience as the key tools for investigation. The former refers to\nthe logical and philosophical principles of Aristotelianism, the\nlatter refers to both quotidian experience and the experiences found\nin the writings of authorities, witnessed in testimonies of\ncontemporaries, and taken from his own personal history. He had a\ncritical attitude toward some humanist writers, for example, judging\nGiovanni Pico della Mirandola\u2019s attack on astrology to be\nignorant of the workings of the field. And while his Latin prose did\nnot match the polished elegance of Renaissance humanists, in\nother ways his writings, through their extensive consideration of\nancient philosophical and literary sources,\nreflect developments of humanism. Despite never learning\nGreek as many of his fellow philosophers did, including his rival\nAgostino Nifo, Pomponazzi relied on new translations of Greek\ncommentators on Aristotle, most significantly those of Alexander of\nAphrodisias (Kessler 2011). Furthermore, his later writings,\nespecially On Incantations, take evidence from a broad range\nof Greek, Roman, and Renaissance poets and historians, interspersed\namong citations of the typical authorities of the scholastic\ntraditions. In that work, he also discussed the possible natural\ncauses of the Delphic oracle (see Ossa-Richardson 2010).\n",
