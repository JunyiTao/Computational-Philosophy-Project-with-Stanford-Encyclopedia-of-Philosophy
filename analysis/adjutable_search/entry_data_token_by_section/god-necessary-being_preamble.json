    "main_text": "\n\nIt is commonly accepted that there are two sorts of existent entities:\nthose that exist but could have failed to exist, and those that could\nnot have failed to exist. Entities of the first sort are\ncontingent beings; entities of the second sort are\nnecessary\n beings.[1]\n We will be concerned with the latter sort of entity in this\narticle.\n\nThere are various entities which, if they exist, would be candidates\nfor necessary beings: God, propositions, relations, properties, states\nof affairs, possible worlds, and numbers, among others. Note that the\nfirst entity in this list is a concrete entity, while the rest are\nabstract\n entities.[2]\n Many interesting philosophical questions arise when one inquires\nabout necessary beings: What makes it the case that they exist\nnecessarily? Is there a grounding for their necessary existence? Do\nsome of them depend on others? If so, how might one understand the\ndependence relation?\n",
