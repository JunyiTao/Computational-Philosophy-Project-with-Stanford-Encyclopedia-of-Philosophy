    "main_text": "Reconciling Morality and Prudential Rationality || The Social Sanctions Strategy\n3.2 The Social Sanctions Strategy\n\nWhere the previous approach to the Reconciliation Project relied on\nsanctions that an agent imposes on herself, the social sanctions\nstrategy relies on costs imposed by others. This strategy is\nexemplified by Hobbes\u2019 response to the Foole and Hume\u2019s\ndiscussion of the harvesting dilemma, the latter of which Skyrms\n(1998) and Sobel (2009) identify with the game previously depicted in\n Figure 2.\n Hobbes maintains that to offensively violate a covenant is to make a\nchoice that tends towards self-destruction, since others will be\nunwilling to enter into future covenants with one known to do so\n(Hobbes 1651: 15:5). Similarly, Hume argues that we make promises in\norder to create expectations of our future conduct, and that we keep\npromises in order to preserve the trust of others that is needed if we\nhope to enter into and benefit from future covenants (Hume 1740:\n3.3.5: 8\u201312). As our earlier discussion of the evolution of\ncooperation anticipated, we can use the theory of repeated\ngames to shed light on this strategy.\n\nWhen agents engage in a sequence of interactions, each of which can be\ncharacterized as a single noncooperative game, then they can adopt\nhistory-dependent strategies where their actions in any\nparticular iteration of the game depend upon actions taken in prior\niterations. Early on, game theorists recognized that when agents\nengage in games that are repeated indefinitely they can use\nsuch strategies to arrive at equilibria that include acts that are\nnever parts of an equilibrium of any of the constituent games that are\nbeing repeated. This insight led to a body of results known as the\nfolk theorem that establishes conditions under which a\nprofile of history-dependent strategies will be an equilibrium of an\nindefinitely repeated game. Sugden (1986) and Skyrms (1998) were among\nthe first to argue that Hobbes\u2019s response to the Foole and\nHume\u2019s analysis of promises present proto-folk theorem\narguments.\n\nTo illustrate how the folk theorem might support the social sanctions\nstrategy, suppose that Laura and Claudia are interested in exchanging\nwith one another and that their situation has the structure of the\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma depicted in\n Figure 5\n below.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nParty 2 (Laura) \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nP\nA  \n\n\nParty 1 (Claudia)\nP\n(2,2)\n(0,3) \n\nA\n(3,0)\n(1,1)  \n\n\nP = perform, A = anticipate\n\nFigure 5. Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\n\n\nThis prisoner\u2019s dilemma is structurally identical to the\nMortarmen\u2019s Dilemma of\n Figure 1,\n but here we interpret the parties\u2019 strategies rather\ndifferently. (A, A) is the unique equilibrium of\nthis game that characterizes Laura and Claudia\u2019s particular\ninteraction with one another. However, if we suppose that their\ninteraction is one of an indefinite sequence of similar interactions\nthat they will enter into with each other and other members of their\ncommunity, then they can follow history-dependent strategies. One such\nstrategy, formulated by Sugden (1986), is the Humean\nstrategy:\n\n\\(h^{*}\\): follow P if my current partner is innocent, and\nfollow A if she is guilty,\n\nwhere one is guilty if she has offensively violated a covenant by\nanticipating or aggressing against an innocent partner at some point\nin the past, otherwise she is innocent. If Claudia expects all of her\npartners in the indefinitely repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma to\nfollow \\(h^{*}\\), then \\(h^{*}\\) can be Claudia\u2019s best response.\nFor example, if Claudia and Laura are both innocent when they meet in\ntheir prisoner\u2019s dilemma, then if Claudia follows \\(h^{*}\\), she\nwill perform and remain innocent, and so she can expect her partners\nin future iterations to perform with her since they also follow\n\\(h^{*}\\). If, on the other hand, Claudia anticipates against Laura,\nthen Claudia becomes guilty and she should expect future partners to\nanticipate against her in future iterations as \\(h^{*}\\) requires. In\nother words, if Claudia has sufficiently high expectation that the\nsequence of iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemmas will continue, then the\nshort-run benefit from offensively violating her covenant with Laura\nwill be swamped by the long-run payoff from future mutually beneficial\ninteractions that \\(h^{*}\\) enables and anticipating precludes.\nFurthermore, the long-run benefit of keeping her reputation intact\nmeans that as long as Claudia\u2019s discount rate isn\u2019t too\nhigh, then this is likely to be true even if she misread things with\nLaura and gets exploited by her. Finally, because their situations are\nsymmetrical, \\(h^{*}\\) can be a best response for Laura and all the\nother community members, provided that they all expect most other\ncommunity members to follow \\(h^{*}\\).\n\nThe discussion above shows that obeying the requirement of justice to\nrefrain from offensively violating covenants can be rational, even\nthough it may not appear to be rational in any particular instance.\nLike the inseparable goods strategy, then, the social sanctions\nstrategy implies that the mistake the Foole makes is to misconstrue\nthe games that characterize social interactions where morality makes\ndemands on us. However, where the inseparable goods strategy suggests\nthat the Foole ignores some of the goods intrinsic to moral conduct,\nthe social sanctions strategy warns the Foole that the game they\nshould be concerned with is not any particular interaction, but rather\nthe indefinitely repeated series of social interactions in which they\nare inevitably engaged. That said, the strategy profile where every\nagent adopts \\(h^{*}\\) is not the only possible equilibrium of the\nindefinitely repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma. In fact, there are an\nimmense number of possible equilibria of such a game, many of which do\nnot involve any individuals employing the \\(h^{*}\\) strategy, and not\nall of these lead to the cooperative outcome where all (or even most)\nagents keep their promises.\n",
