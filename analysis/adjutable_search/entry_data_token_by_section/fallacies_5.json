    "main_text": "History of Fallacy Theory || Watts\n2.5 Watts\n\nIsaac Watts in his Logick; or, The Right Use of Reason\n(1724), furthered the ad-argument tradition by adding three\nmore arguments: argumentum ad fidem (appeal to faith),\nargumentum ad passiones (appeal to passion), and\nargumentum ad populum (a public appeal to passions). Like\nLocke, Watts does not consider these arguments as fallacies but as\nkinds of arguments. However, the Logick does consider\nsophisms and introduces \u201cfalse cause\u201d as an alternative\nname for non causa pro causa which here, as in the Port-Royal\nLogic, is understood as a fallacy associated with empirical causation.\nAccording to Watts it occurs whenever anyone assigns \u201cthe\nreasons of natural appearances, without sufficient experiments to\nprove them\u201d (1796, Pt. III, 3 i 4). Another sophism included by\nWatts is imperfect enumeration or false induction, the mistake of\ngeneralizing on insufficient evidence. Also, the term \u2018strawman\nfallacy\u2019 may have its origins in Watts\u2019s discussion of\nignoratio elenchi: after having dressed up the opinions and\nsentiments of their adversaries as they please to make \u201cimages\nof straw\u201d, disputers \u201ctriumph over their adversary as\nthough they had utterly confuted his opinions\u201d (1796, Pt. III 3\ni 1).\n",
