Now consider the four \u201cstate\ndescriptions\u201d of this simple model as set out\nin Figure 1. So \\(a=H\\cap\nX\\) and so on. Now define \\(Y=a \\cup\nd\\). Alternatively, consider three propositions related in the\nfollowing way: \\(Y\\) is defined as\n\u201c\\(H\\) if and only\nif \\(X\\)\u201d.\n\n\nFigure 1: A diagram of the relationships after Seidenfeld (1994); \\(Y\\) is the shaded area\n\nFurther imagine that \\(p(H\\mid X) = p(H) =\n1/2\\). No other relationships between the propositions hold\nexcept those required by logic and probability theory. It is\nstraightforward to verify that the above constraints require\nthat \\(p(Y) = 1/2\\). The probability\nfor \\(X\\), however, is unconstrained.\nLet\u2019s imagine you were given the above information, and took your\nrepresentor to be the full set of probability functions that satisfied\nthese constraints. Roger White suggested an intuitive gloss on how you\nmight receive information about propositions so related and so\nconstrained (White 2010). White\u2019s puzzle\ngoes like this. I have a proposition \\(X\\),\nabout which you know nothing at all. I have written whichever is true\nout of \\(X\\) and \\(\\neg\nX\\) on the Heads side of a fair coin. I have painted\nover the coin so you can\u2019t see which side is heads. I then flip the\ncoin and it lands with the \\(X\\)\nuppermost. \\(H\\) is the proposition that the\ncoin lands heads up. \\(Y\\) is the proposition\nthat the coin lands with the\n\u201c\\(X\\)\u201d side up.\nImagine if you had a precise prior that made you certain\nof \\(X\\) (this is compatible with the above\nconstraints since \\(X\\) was\nunconstrained). Seeing \\(X\\) land uppermost\nnow should be evidence that the coin has landed heads. The game set-up\nmakes it such that these apparently irrelevant instances of\nevidence can carry information. Likewise, being very\nconfident of \\(X\\)\nmakes \\(Y\\) very good evidence\nfor \\(H\\). If instead you were\nsure \\(X\\) was\nfalse, \\(Y\\) would be solid gold evidence\nof \\(H\\)\u2019s falsity. So it seems\nthat \\(p(H\\mid Y)\\) is proportional to prior\nbelief in \\(X\\) (indeed, this can be proven\nrather easily). Given the way the events are related, observing\nwhether \\(X\\) or \\(\\neg\nX\\) landed uppermost is a noisy channel to learn about whether\nor not \\(H\\) landed uppermost.\nSo let\u2019s go back to the original imprecise case and consider what\nit means to have an imprecise belief\nin \\(X\\). Among other things, it means\nconsidering possible that \\(X\\) could be very\nlikely. It is consistent with your belief state\nthat \\(X\\) is such that if you knew what\nproposition \\(X\\) was, you would consider it\nvery likely. In this case, \\(Y\\) would be good\nevidence for \\(H\\). Note that in this case\nlearning that the coin landed \\(\\neg X\\)\nuppermost\u2014call\nthis \\(Y'\\)\u2014would be just as good\nevidence\nagainst \\(H\\). Likewise, \\(X\\)\nmight be a proposition that you would have very low credence in, and\nthus \\(Y\\) would be\nevidence against \\(H\\).\nSince you are in a state of ignorance with respect\nto \\(X\\), your representor contains\nprobabilities that take \\(Y\\) to be good\nevidence that \\(H\\) and probabilities that\ntake \\(Y\\) to be good evidence\nthat \\(\\neg H\\). So, despite the fact\nthat \\(P(H)=\\{1/2\\}\\) we\nhave \\(P(H\\mid Y) = [0,1]\\). This\nphenomenon\u2014posteriors being wider than their priors\u2014is\nknown as dilation. The phenomenon has been thoroughly investigated in\nthe mathematical literature (Walley 1991;\nSeidenfeld and Wasserman 1993; Herron, Seidenfeld, and Wasserman 1994;\nPedersen and Wheeler 2014). Levi and Seidenfeld reported\nan example of dilation to Good following Good\n(1967). Good mentioned this correspondence in his follow up\npaper (Good 1974). Recent interest in\ndilation in the philosophical community has been generated by White\u2019s\npaper (White 2010).\nWhite considers dilation to be a problem since learning \\(Y\\)\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be relevant to \\(H\\). That is, since\nyou are ignorant about \\(X\\), learning whether or not the coin landed\n\\(X\\) up doesn\u2019t seem to tell you anything about whether the\ncoin landed heads up. It seems strange to argue that your belief in\n\\(H\\) should dilate from \\(1/2\\) to \\([0,1]\\) upon learning\n\\(Y\\). It feels as if this should just be irrelevant to\n\\(H\\). However, \\(Y\\) is only really irrelevant to \\(H\\) when\n\\(p(X)=1/2\\). Any other precise belief you might have in \\(X\\) is such\nthat \\(Y\\) now affects your posterior belief in\n\\(H\\). Figure 2 shows the situation for one\nparticular belief about how likely \\(X\\) is; for one particular \\(p\\in\nP\\). The horizontal line can shift up or down, depending on what the\ncommittee member we focus on believes about \\(X\\). \\(p(H\\mid Y)\\) is\na half only if the prior in \\(X\\) is also a half. However, the\nimprecise probabilist takes into account all the ways \\(Y\\) might\naffect belief in \\(H\\).\n\n\nFigure 2: A member of the credal committee (after Joyce (2011))\n\nConsider a group of agents who each had precise credences in the\nabove coin case and differed in their priors\non \\(X\\). They would all start out with prior\nof a half in \\(H\\). After\nlearning \\(Y\\), these agents would differ in\ntheir posterior opinions about \\(H\\) based on\ntheir differing dispositions to update. The group belief would\ndilate. However, no agent in the group has acted in any way\nunreasonably. If we take Levi\u2019s suggestion that individuals can be\nconflicted just like groups can, then it seems that individual agents\ncan have their beliefs dilate just like groups can.\nThere are two apparent problems with dilation. First, the\nbelief-moving effect of apparently irrelevant evidence; and second,\nthe fact that learning some evidence can cause your belief-intervals\nto widen. The above comments speak to the first of\nthese. Pedersen and Wheeler\n(2014) also are focused on mitigating this worry. We\nturn now to the second worry.\nEven if we accept dilation as a fact of life for the imprecise\nprobabilist, it is still weird. Even if all of the above\nargument is accepted, it still seems strange to say that your belief\nin \\(H\\) is dilated, whatever you\nlearn. That is, whether you learn \\(Y\\)\nor \\(Y'\\), your posterior belief\nin \\(H\\) looks the\nsame: \\([0,1]\\). Or perhaps, what it shows to\nbe weird is that your initial credence was precise.\n\nHart and Titelbaum (2015) suggest that dilation is strange because conditionalising on a biconditional (which is, after all, what you are doing in the above example) is unintuitive even in the precise case. Whether all cases of dilation can be explained away in this manner remains to be seen.\nGong and Meng (2017) likewise see dilation as a problem of mis-specified statistical inference, rather than a problem for IP per se.\n\nBeyond this seeming strangeness, White suggests a specific way that\nbeing subject to dilation is an indicator of a defective\nepistemology. White suggests that dilation examples show that\nimprecise probabilities violate the Reflection\nPrinciple (van Fraassen 1984). The\nargument goes as follows:\n given that you know now that whether you\nlearn \\(Y\\) or you\nlearn \\(Y'\\) your credence\nin \\(H\\) will\nbe \\([0,1]\\) (and you will certainly learn one\nor the other), your current credence in \\(H\\)\nshould also be \\([0,1]\\).\n The general idea is that you should set your\n credences to what you expect your credences to be in the future. More\n specifically, your credence in \\(X\\) should\n be the expectation of your future possible credences\n in \\(X\\) over the things you might\n learn. Given that, for all the things you might learn in this example\n your credence in \\(H\\) would be the same, you\n should have that as your prior credence also. Your prior should be\n such that \\(P(H) = [0,1]\\). So having a\n precise prior credence in \\(H\\) to start with\n is irrational. That\u2019s how the argument against dilation from\n reflection goes. Your prior \\(P\\) is not\n fully precise though. Consider \\(P(H \\cap\n Y)\\). That is, the prior belief in the conjunction is\n imprecise. So the alleged problem with dilation and reflection is not\n as simple as \u201cyour precise belief becomes imprecise\u201d. The\n problem is \u201cyour precise\n belief in \\(H\\) becomes\n imprecise\u201d; or rather, your precise belief\n in \\(H\\) as represented\n by \\(P(H)\\) becomes imprecise.\nThe issue with reflection is more basic. What exactly does\nreflection require of imprecise probabilists in this case? Now, it is\nobviously the case that each credal committee member\u2019s prior credence\nis its expectation over the possible future evidence (this is a\ntheorem of probability theory). But somehow, it is felt,\nthe credal state as a whole isn\u2019t sensitive to reflection in\nthe way the principle requires. Each \\(p\\in\nP\\) satisfies the principle, but the awkward symmetries of the\nproblem conspire to make \\(P\\) as a whole\nviolate the principle. This looks to be the case if we focus\non \\(P(H)\\) as an adequate representation of\nthat part of the belief state. But as noted earlier, this is not an\nadequate way of understanding the credal state. Note that while\nlearning \\(Y\\) and\nlearning \\(Y'\\) both prompt revision to a\nstate where the posterior belief in \\(H\\) is\nrepresented as an interval by \\([0,1]\\), the\ncredal states as sets of probabilities are not the same. Call\nthe state after\nlearning \\(Y\\), \\(P'\\)\nand the state after\nlearning \\(Y'\\), \\(P''\\). So \\(P'\n= \\{p(\\cdot \\mid Y), p\\in P\\}\\)\nand \\(P'' = \\{p(\\cdot\\mid Y'), p\\in\nP\\}\\). While it is true that \\(P'(H) =\nP''(H)\\), \\(P' \\neq\nP''\\) as sets of probabilities, since\nif \\(p\\in P'\\)\nthen \\(p(Y) = 1\\) whereas\nif \\(p\\in P''\\)\nthen \\(p(Y) = 0\\). So one lesson we should\nlearn from dilation is that imprecise belief is represented\nby sets of functions rather than by a set-valued\nfunction (see also, Joyce 2011; Topey 2012;\nBradley and Steele 2014b).\n\nSo dilation can perhaps be tamed or rationalised, and the issue with reflection can be mitigated.\nBut there is still a puzzle that dilation raises:\nin the precise context we have a nice result \u2013 due to Good (1967) \u2013\nthat says roughly that learning new information has positive expected value.\nInformation has positive value.\nThis result is, to some extent, undermined by dilation.\nBradley and Steele (2016) suggest that there is \nsome sense in which Good\u2019s result can be partially salvaged in the IP setting.\n\nIt seems that examples of dilation undermine the earlier claim that\nimprecise probabilities allow you to represent the difference between\nthe weight and balance of evidence\n(see section 2.3):\nlearning \\(Y\\) appears to give rise to a\nbelief which one would consider as representing less evidence\nsince it is more spread out. This is so because the prior credence in\nthe dilation case is precise, not through weight of evidence, but\nthrough the symmetry discussed earlier. We cannot take narrowness of\nthe interval \\([\\underline{P}(X),\n\\overline{P}(X)]\\) as a characterisation of weight of evidence\nsince the interval can be narrow for reasons other than because lots\nof evidence has been accumulated. So my earlier remarks on\nweight/balance should not be read as the claim that imprecise\nprobabilities can always represent the weight/balance\ndistinction. What is true is that there are cases where\nimprecise probabilities can represent the distinction in a way that\nimpacts on decision making. This issue is far from settled and more\nwork needs to be done on this topic.\n",
