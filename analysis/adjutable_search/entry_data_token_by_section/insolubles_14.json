    "main_text": "The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century || Roger Swyneshed\n3.3 Roger Swyneshed\n\nSometime between roughly 1330 and 1335, the English Benedictine Roger\nSwyneshed adopted a theory in some respects reminiscent of\nBradwardine\u2019s, but with interesting features of its own. Like\nBradwardine, Swyneshed held that for a proposition to be true, it is\nnot enough that it \u201csignify as is the case\u201d. But whereas\nBradwardine maintained that in addition the proposition must not\nsignify otherwise than is the case (that is, it must signify\nonly as is the case), Swyneshed said that in addition the\nproposition must not \u201cfalsify itself\u201d. Propositions that\nfalsify themselves are said to be those that are \u201crelevant\n(pertinens) to inferring that they are false\u201d. Thus\nwhere Bradwardine amended the account of both signification and\nconsequently of truth, Swyneshed amended only the account of truth.\nInsolubles do falsify themselves, and so are false for that reason,\neven though they signify as is the case.\n\nThe notion of \u201crelevance\u201d clearly relates to the theory of\nObligationes (q.v.). Much of Bradwardine\u2019s,\nSwyneshed\u2019s and Heytesbury\u2019s treatises uses the\nterminology of\n Obligationes-treatises.[21]\n But the main historical interest of his theory does not lie there.\nRather, it lies in three famous and controversial conclusions he drew\nfrom his principles:\n\nSome false propositions signify as is the case. Insolubles\n do.[22]\n Thus, where a is the insoluble \u2018a is\nfalse\u2019, a is self-falsifying and so false. But it\nsignifies as is the case (namely, that it is false).\nIn some valid formal inferences, falsehoods follow from truths.\nFor consider the inference \u201cThe conclusion of this inference is\nfalse; therefore, the conclusion of this inference is false\u201d.\nThe premise and the conclusion of this inference are not only two\ntokens of the same type, but more importantly say the same thing about\nthe same thing, so, Swyneshed claimed, the inference is a formally\nvalid one. (Bradwardine and Buridan would both disagree.) But while\nthe conclusion is a self-falsifying insoluble, and so is false, the\npremise is not self-falsifying, and is in fact true.\n(The conclusion of the inference is false, on\nSwyneshed\u2019s account, because it falsifies itself.) Here then, a\nfalsehood validly follows from a truth.\nIn the case of insolubles, two mutually contradictory propositions\nare false at the same time. Where a = \u2018a is\nfalse\u2019, a is insoluble and false. But its contradictory,\n\u2018a is not false\u2019, Swyneshed claims, is\nnot insoluble and is not self-falsifying. Nevertheless, it is\nfalse because it signifies otherwise than is the case. The insoluble\na really is\n false.[23]\n\n\nMany authors found these conclusions ridiculous, especially the second\nand third ones. But they had their defenders as\n well.[24]\n\nSwyneshed explicitly considers a situation where a =\n\u2018a does not signify as is the case\u2019, and says that\na is neither true nor false in that situation. This is the only\nknown case of a medieval author\u2019s actually allowing failure of\nbivalence for insolubles, even though several authors refer to (and\nreject) such\n theories.[25]\n",
