    "main_text": "Fatalism, Bivalence, and Determinism || Carneades on the fatalist argument and a voluntary motion of our minds\n1.3 Carneades on the fatalist argument and a voluntary motion of our minds\n\nCarneades also wishes to rebut the fatalist argument and deny that\nwhat will occur is\n inevitable.[1]\n Unlike Aristotle and Epicurus, however, he does not reject the\nPrinciple of Bivalence, and he says that whenever you have a pair of\ncontradictory statements, such as \u201cTim O\u2019Keefe will die\nfrom cancer\u201d and \u201cTim O\u2019Keefe will not die from\ncancer\u201d, one is true and the other false (Fat. 37, LS\n20H). Instead of rejecting PB, he thinks the fatalist argument goes\nwrong when it assumes that if it is true from eternity that an event\nwill occur, then that event is necessary. That is because both\nEpicurus and Stoics are wrong to believe that the principle of\nbivalence and causal determinism are interentailing. The truth of a\nstatement does not imply that there are \u201cimmutable eternal\ncauses\u201d that make it true (Fat. 28, LS 70G).\nInstead, it is simply the fact that things will turn out as the\nstatement says they will that makes it true.\n\nAn example to illustrate Carneades\u2019 position: let us imagine\nthat Tim O\u2019Keefe develops cancer, but he seeks out treatment,\nrecovers, and ends up dying peacefully in his sleep of other causes at\nthe age of 100, in 2068. If somebody were to say, in 2020, \u201cTim\nO\u2019Keefe will not die of cancer\u201d, they said something true,\nbecause, just as they said, Tim O\u2019Keefe in fact did not die of\ncancer. Their statement was not \u201cneutral\u201d when they made\nit, and later became true; it was true all along. In order to\ndefend his position, Carneades appeals to the symmetry of the past and\nfuture: \n\n\nFor just as we call \u201ctrue\u201d those past things of which it\nwas at an earlier time true that they were being actualized, so we\nwill call \u201ctrue\u201d those future things that of which it will\nlater be true that they are being actualized. (Fat. 27, LS\n70G) \n\n\nJust as something\u2019s being true in the past does not depend on\nits having certain effects now, something\u2019s being true\nin the future does not depend on its having certain causes\nnow. If the statement \u201cTim O\u2019Keefe was adopted in\n1968\u201d is now true, it is not true because he presently remembers\nbeing told by his mother and father that they adopted him, or because\nof any of the other present effects of his adoption. Instead, it is\ntrue simply because he was, as a matter of fact, adopted in 1968.\n\nTo understand Carneades\u2019 position, we should distinguish between\nthe truthmaker for a statement and the cause of an\nevent. If I go to the doctor and recover from my cancer, the\ncause of my recovering from the disease is the doctor\u2019s\ntreatment, and the cause of my going to the doctor is my decision to\ndo so. The truthmaker for the statement \u201cTim will\nrecover from his cancer\u201d is my recovering from the cancer, but\nthe statement\u2019s eternal truth doesn\u2019t cause my\nfuture recovery. Once we make this distinction, then we should see\nthat the principle of bivalence does not threaten our freedom.\nAccording to Carneades, our own voluntary actions are one of the\ncauses of events. And these actions are under our control. The way\nCarneades puts it is that the cause of our actions is a\n\u201cvoluntary motion of the mind\u201d, a motion which has an\nintrinsic nature of being in our power and of obeying us\n(Fat. 24\u20135, LS 20E). There is a truth beforehand concerning\nhow I will act, e.g., that I will seek out treatment for my cancer.\nBut my action of seeking out treatment is nonetheless under my\ncontrol, and my seeking out the treatment is not necessary, as I have\nthe ability not to seek out the treatment. (Consider here\nCarneades\u2019 analogy with the past: just because there is a truth\nabout how I did voluntarily act in the past, this does not imply that\nmy past actions were not under my control, or that it was necessary\nthat I act in the ways that I did.)\n\nCarneades thinks that, while the fatalist argument from bivalence\nfails, the fatalist argument can be successfully restated in terms of\ncausal determinism, since causal determinism is incompatible with our\nactions truly being in our power (Fat. 31, LS 70G.) That is\nbecause, for our actions to be in our power, we must have the ability\nto make things turn out otherwise than they actually do turn out\n(Fat. 45), and this ability is incompatible with all things\nbeing predetermined by an interconnected chain of natural causes\n(Fat. 31, LS 70G). According to Carneades, human actions have\na cause\u2014the \u201cvoluntary motion of the mind\u201d\u2014but\nthe way in which we exercise this power and move ourselves is not\nitself causally necessitated.\n\nThis is why Carneades denies that even the gods can foretell the\nfuture. Carneades assumes that to know what is going to occur in the\nfuture, you must know the present causes which will bring about that\nfuture event. For instance, in order to know that a major earthquake\nwill occur in California a year hence, I would need to have\ninformation about the present disposition of California\u2019s\nvarious faults and the pressure they are exerting on one another,\nalong with the facts about things like how faults operate, which all\ntogether will bring about the future quake. Not even Apollo, however,\ncan foretell events like Oedipus killing his father, even though it\nhas always been true that Oedipus would do so. That is\nbecause such actions, before they occur, have no pre-existing causes\nthat would bring them about, that Apollo could inspect in order to\ntell that they are going to occur (Fat. 32\u201333, LS 70G).\n",
