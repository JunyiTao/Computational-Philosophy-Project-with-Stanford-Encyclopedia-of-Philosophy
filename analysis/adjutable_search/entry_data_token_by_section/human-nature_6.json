It might appear that it leaves\nopen the possibility that speciation has resulted in some intrinsic\nproperty or set of properties establishing the cohesion specific to\nthe taxon and that such properties count as necessary and sufficient\nfor belonging to it (cf. Devitt 2008: 17ff.). This appearance would be\ndeceptive. To begin with, no intrinsic property can be necessary\nbecause of the sheer empirical improbability that all species\nspecimens grouped together by the relevant lineage segment instantiate\nany such candidate property. For example, there are individuals who\nare missing legs, inner organs or the capacity for language, but who\nremain biologically human (Hull 1986: 5). Evolutionary theory\nclarifies why this is so: variability, secured by mechanisms such as\nmutation and recombination, is the key to evolution, so that, should\nsome qualitative property happen to be universal among all extant\nspecies specimens immediately after the completion of speciation, that\nis no guarantee that it will continue to be so throughout the lifespan\nof the taxon (Hull 1984: 35; Ereshefsky 2008: 101). The common thought\nthat there must be at least some genetic property common to all human\norganisms is also false (R. Wilson 1999a: 190; Sterelny &\nGriffiths 1999: 7; Okasha 2002: 196f.): phenotypical properties that\nare shared in a population are frequently co-instantiated as a result\nof the complex interaction of differing gene-regulatory networks.\nConversely, the same network can under different circumstances lead to\ndiffering phenotypical consequences (Walsh 2006: 437ff.). Even if it\nshould turn out that every human organism instantiated some property,\nthis would be a contingent, rather than a necessary fact (Sober 1980:\n354; Hull 1986: 3).\n\nMoreover, the chances of any such universal property also being\nsufficient are vanishingly small, as the sharing of properties by\nspecimens of other species can result from various mechanisms, in\nparticular from the inheritance of common genes in related species and\nfrom parallel evolution. This doesn\u2019t entail that there may be\nno intrinsic properties that are sufficient belonging to the species.\nThere are fairly good candidates for such properties, if we compare\nhumans with other terrestrial organisms. Language use and a\nself-understanding as moral agents come to mind. However, whether\nnon-terrestrial entities might possess such properties is an open\nquestion. And decisively, they are obviously hopeless as necessary\nconditions (cf. Samuels 2012: 9).\n\nThis leaves only the possibility that the conditions for belonging to\nthe species are, like the individuating conditions for the species\ntaxon, relational. Lineage-based individuation of a taxon depends on\nits component organisms being spatially and temporally situated in\nsuch a way that the causal processes necessary for the inheritance of\ntraits can take place. In the human case, the key processes are those\nof sexual reproduction. Therefore, being an organism that belongs to\nthe species Homo sapiens is a matter of being connected\nreproductively to organisms situated unequivocally on the relevant\nlineage segment. In other words, the key necessary condition is having\nbeen sexually reproduced by specimens of the species (Kronfeldner\n2018: 100). Hull suggests that the causal condition may be\ndisjunctive, as it could also be fulfilled by a synthetic entity\ncreated by scientists that produces offspring with humans who have\nbeen generated in the standard manner (Hull 1978: 349). Provided that\nthe species is not in the throes of speciation, such direct descent or\nintegration into the reproductive community, i.e., participation in\nthe \u201ccomplex network [\u2026] of mating and\nreproduction\u201d (Hull 1986: 4), will also be sufficient.\n",
