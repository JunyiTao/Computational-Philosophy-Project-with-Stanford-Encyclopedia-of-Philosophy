    "main_text": "Further Arguments for EC, with some Non-Contextualist Responses || The Social Role of Knowledge Ascriptions\n5.3 The Social Role of Knowledge Ascriptions\nMuch of the debate surrounding EC has concerned particular uses of \u2018know\u2019 in various contexts \u2014 specifically, their intuitive truth or falsity. Edward Craig, however, has urged that instead of focusing directly on \u2018know\u2019 and its cognates, we should ask \u201cwhat knowledge does for us, what its role in our life might be, and then ask what a concept having that role would be like\u201d (1990, 2, emphasis added). In large part thanks to Craig\u2019s work, the social role of knowledge ascriptions has recently come in for focused investigation, with some seeing in that study new arguments for EC.\nAccording to Craig, \u201cthe core of the concept of knowledge is an outcome of certain very general facts about the human situation\u201d (1990, 10). The most conspicuous such general fact is that we must rely on others as sources of information (1990, 11), which in turn gives rise to the need for some way to pick out good informants. \u201c[A]t its most subjective,\u201d the need is for an informant who, among other things, is accessible to and recognizable by me here and now, and as likely to be right about p as my concerns require (ibid., 84\u201385). However, the high degree of purpose-relativity of the \u2018subjectivized\u2019 notion of the good informant makes it ill-suited to play an effective inter-personal role. According to Craig, for there to be useful sharing of information individuals must share a common point of view concerning the character and presence of good informants. Hence the pressure to form an \u2018objectivized\u2019 concept \u2014 one that retains the \u2018common core\u2019 of the notion without tying it to the needs, abilities, and circumstances of specific individuals \u201cand so varying with them\u201d (1990, 88). Craig\u2019s proposal, in brief, is that the concept of the knower is the objectivized notion of a good informant (ibid., 90\u201391).[24]\nA number of writers have suggested that broadly Craigian reflections on the social role of \u201cknowledge\u201d attributions provide a novel line of support for EC. Thus, while Craig\u2019s process of objectivization was intended to minimize the context-relativity and -variability of judgments as to a potential informant\u2019s reliability, Greco (2008, 432-435; 2010, 119-122) thinks that we should acknowledge and embrace the latter. Specifically, Greco suggests, the Craigian story \u201cspeaks in favor of a version of attributor contextualism that allows that the attributor context be sensitive to the interests and purposes operative in the subject\u2019s practical environment\u201d (2008, 433; 2010, 120). (Similar views have been presented by Hannon 2013 and McKenna 2013, 2014.)\nDavid Henderson (2009, 2011) has also argued that, by reflecting on \u201cthe point or purpose of the concept of knowledge\u201d,\u00a0a form of EC \u201cgets a kind of principled motivation\u201d (2009, 125). Henderson also claims, however, that his \u2018gate-keeping contextualism\u2019 has the virtue of respecting the attractions and motivations of Invariantism. Like Craig and Greco, Henderson takes a central function of \u201cknowledge\u201d ascriptions to be the certification of agents as good sources of information. Those agents might belong to applied practical or general-purpose source communities. In the former, where \u201cthe attributor is engaged in gate keeping for a group focused on some practical project\u201d, s/he \u201cshould be contextually invested in such interests\u201d (2009, 126); and here, Henderson argues, we find a new rationale for EC. However, when an attributor is gate keeping for a general-source community, where the information may potentially be very widely shared and there is likely to be no \u201csimple decisive understanding of just what counts as actionable information\u201d, we get the much more Craigian recommendation that\nto qualify as knowing that p (in a general purpose source community) an agent must be situated with respect to p so as to be able to distinguish p\u2019s obtaining from all the alternatives that would be relevant across all the communities that might draw on it, including those for which the stakes are high. (2009, 127)\nThis yields \u201csomething like\u201d (2009, 127) familiar Invariantism, albeit only within certain contexts:\nThe invariantist pull is honored by treating the invariantist\u2019s favored semantic standard for knowledge [or, for the correct application of \u2018knowledge\u2019] as being just one, among various, kinds of semantic standards. Each standard is, in context, motivated by gatekeeping purposes. (Henderson and Horgan 2015, 99)\nAs Henderson notes (2009, 130\u2013131), the envisaged combination of contexualist and invariantist ideas might prove unstable: actual attributors are members of multiple, overlapping communities; information is constantly being shared multilaterally; and so on. Factors such as these are among the considerations cited by Rysiew (2012) in arguing that its having a traditional invariantist semantics might make \u2018know\u2019 better suited to fulfilling certain central social roles. (For a reply, see Hannon 2015.) Such claims take us back to considerations of whether EC sits well with the transfer and storage of information (see Section 4.5). More generally, they serve to show that the bearing of certain data upon the semantics of \u2018know\u2019 is just as controversial when we\u2019re considering the term\u2019s (or concept\u2019s) social role or function, as when we are considering particular uses of it.\n",
