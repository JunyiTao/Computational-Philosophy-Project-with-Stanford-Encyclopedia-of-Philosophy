Semantic Structure and Events\n\nIf propositions are the \u201cthings\u201d that really have logical\nform, and sentences of English are not themselves propositions, then\nsentences of English \u201chave\u201d logical forms only by\nassociation with propositions. But if the meaning of a sentence is\nsome proposition\u2014or perhaps a function from contexts to\npropositions\u2014then one might say that the logical form\n\u201cof\u201d a sentence is its semantic structure (i.e., the\nstructure of that sentence\u2019s meaning). Alternatively, one might\nsuspect that in the end, talk of propositions is just convenient\nshorthand for talking about the semantic properties of certain\nsentences: perhaps sentences of a Begriffsschrift, or sentences of\nmentalese, or sentences of natural languages (abstracting away from\ntheir logically/semantically irrelevant properties). In any case, the\nnotion of logical form has played a significant role in recent work on\ntheories of meaning for natural languages. So an introductory\ndiscussion of logical form would not be complete without some hint of\nwhy such work is relevant, especially since attending to details of\nnatural languages (as opposed to languages invented to study the\nfoundations of arithmetic) led to renewed discussion of how to\nrepresent propositions that involve relations.\n\nPrima facie, \u2018Every old patient respects some doctor\u2019 and\n\u2018Some young politician likes every liar\u2019 exhibit common\nmodes of linguistic combination. So a natural hypothesis is that the\nmeaning of each sentence is fixed by these modes of combination, given\nthe relevant word meanings. It may be hard to see how this hypothesis\ncould be true if there are widespread mismatches between logical and\ngrammatical form. But it is also hard to see how the hypothesis could\nbe false. Children, who have finite cognitive resources, typically\nacquire the capacity to understand the endlessly many expressions of\nthe languages spoken around them. A great deal of recent work has\nfocussed on these issues, concerning the connections between logical\nform and the senses in which natural languages are semantically\n compositional.\n\nIt was implicit in Frege that each of the endlessly many sentences of\nan ideal language would have a compositionally determined\ntruth-condition. Frege did not actually specify an algorithm that\nwould associate each sentence of his Begriffsschrift with its\ntruth-condition. But\n Tarski (1933) showed how to do this for the\n first-order predicate calculus, focussing on interesting cases of\n multiple quantification like the one shown below:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\forall x &[\\textrm{Number}(x) \\:\\rightarrow \\\\\n & \\exists y [\\textrm{SuccessorOf}(y, x) \n \\land \\forall z [\\textrm{SuccessorOf}(z, x) \\rightarrow z =  y]]]\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis made it possible to capture, with precision, the idea that an\ninference is valid in the predicate calculus iff: every interpretation\nthat makes the premises true also makes the conclusion true, holding\nfixed the interpretations of logical elements like \u2018if\u2019\nand \u2018every\u2019. Davidson (1967a) conjectured that one could\ndo for English what Tarski did for the predicate calculus; and\nMontague, similarly inspired by Tarski, showed how one could start\ndealing with predicates that have quantificational\nconstituents. Still, many apparent objections to the conjecture\nremained. As noted at the end of\n section four,\n sentences like \u2018Pat thinks that Hesperus is Phosphorus\u2019\npresent difficulties; though Davidson (1968) offered an influential\nsuggestion. Davidson\u2019s (1967b) proposal concerning examples like\n(37\u201340) also proved enormously fruitful.\n\n(37)\nJuliet kissed Romeo quickly at midnight.\n(38)\nJuliet kissed Romeo quickly.\n(39)\nJuliet kissed Romeo at midnight.\n(40)\nJuliet kissed Romeo.\n\n\nIf (37) is true, so are (38\u201340); and if (38) or (39) is true, so\nis (40). The inferences seem impeccable. But the function-argument\nstructures are not obvious. If we represent \u2018kissed quickly at\nmidnight\u2019 as an unstructured predicate that takes two arguments,\nlike \u2018kissed\u2019 or \u2018kicked\u2019, we will represent\nthe inference from (37) to (40) as having the form: \\(K^*(x, y)\\); so \\(K(x, y)\\).\nBut this form is exemplified by the bad inference \u2018Juliet\nkicked Romeo; so Juliet kissed Romeo\u2019. Put another way, if\n\u2018kissed quickly at midnight\u2019 is a logically unstructured\nbinary predicate, then the following conditional is a nonlogical\nassumption: if Juliet kissed Romeo in a certain manner at a certain\ntime, then Juliet kissed Romeo. But this conditional seems like a\ntautology, not an assumption that introduces any epistemic risk.\nDavidson concluded that the surface appearances of sentences like\n(37\u201340) mask relevant semantic structure. In particular, he\nproposed that such sentences are understood in terms of quantification\nover events.\n\nAccording to Davidson, who echoed Ramsey (1927), the meaning of (40)\nis reflected in the paraphrase \u2018There was a kissing of Romeo by\nJuliet\u2019. One can formalize this proposal in various ways, with\ndifferent implications for how verbs like \u2018kiss\u2019 are\nrelated to propositional constituents: \\(\\exists e [\\textrm{Past}(e)\n\\land \\textrm{KissingOf}(e, \\textrm{Romeo}) \\land\n\\textrm{KissingBy}(e, \\textrm{Juliet})]\\); or \\(\\exists e\n[\\textrm{Past}(e) \\land \\textrm{KissingByOf}(e, \\textrm{Juliet},\n\\textrm{Romeo})]\\); or as in (40a), with Juliet and Romeo explicitly\nrepresented as players of certain roles in an event.\n\n(40a)\n\\(\\exists e [\\textrm{Agent}(e, \\textrm{Juliet}) \\land \\textrm{Kissing}(e) \\land \\textrm{Patient}(e, \\textrm{Romeo})]\\)\n\n\nBut given any such representation, adverbs like \u2018quickly\u2019\nand \u2018at midnight\u2019 can be analyzed as additional predicates\nof events, as shown in (37a\u201339a).\n\n(37a)\n\\(\\exists e [\\textrm{Agent}(e, \\textrm{Juliet}) \\land\n  \\textrm{Kissing}(e) \\land \\textrm{Patient}(e, \\textrm{Romeo})\\:\\land\\)\n  \\(\\textrm{Quick}(e) \\land \\textrm{At-midnight}(e)]\\)\n(38a)\n\\(\\exists e [\\textrm{Agent}(e, \\textrm{Juliet}) \\land\n  \\textrm{Kissing}(e) \\land \\textrm{Patient}(e, \\textrm{Romeo})\\:\\land\\)\n  \\(\\textrm{Quick}(e)]\\)\n(39a)\n\\(\\exists e [\\textrm{Agent}(e, \\textrm{Juliet}) \\land\n  \\textrm{Kissing}(e) \\land \\textrm{Patient}(e, \\textrm{Romeo})\\:\\land\\)\n  \\(\\textrm{At-midnight}(e)]\\)\n\n\nIf this is correct, then the inference from (37) to (40) is an\ninstance of the following valid form: \\(\\exists e [\\ldots e \\ldots\n\\land Q(e) \\land A(e)]\\); hence, \\(\\exists e [\\dots e \\dots]\\). The\nother impeccable inferences involving (37\u201340) can likewise be\nviewed as instances of conjunction reduction in the scope of an\nexistential quantifier; see Pietroski (2018) for discussion that\nconnects this point to medieval insights noted in\n section three.\n If the grammatical form of (40) is simply \u2018{Juliet [kissed\nRomeo]}\u2019, then the mapping from grammatical to logical form is\nnot transparent; and natural language is misleading, in that no word\ncorresponds to the event quantifier. But this does not posit a\nsignificant structural mismatch between grammatical and logical form.\nOn the contrary, each word in (40) corresponds to a conjunct in (40a).\nThis suggests a strategy for thinking about how the meaning of a\nsentence like (40) might be composed from the meanings of the\nconstituent words. A growing body of literature, in philosophy and\nlinguistics, suggests that Davidson\u2019s proposal captures an\nimportant feature of natural language semantics, and that \u201cevent\nanalyses\u201d provide a useful framework for discussions of logical\nform; see, e.g., Schein (2017) for extended discussion and many\nreferences.\n\nIn one sense, it is an ancient idea that action reports like (40)\nrepresent individuals as participating in events; see Gillon\u2019s\n(2007) discussion of P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s grammar of Sanskrit.\nBut if (40) can be glossed as \u2018Juliet did some kissing, and\nRomeo was thereby kissed\u2019, perhaps the ancient idea can be\ndeployed in developing Leibniz\u2019 suggestion that relational\nsentences like (40) somehow contain simpler active-voice and\npassive-voice sentences; cp. Kratzer (1996). And perhaps appeals to\nquantifier raising can help in defending the idea that \u2018Juliet\nkissed some/the/every boy\u2019 is, after all, a sentence\nthat exhibits Subject-copula-Predicate form:\n\u2018[some/the/every boy]i is\nP\u2019, with \u2018P\u2019 as a complex\npredicate akin to \u2018[some event]e was both a\nkissing done by Juliet and one in which hei was\nkissed\u2019.\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s return to the idea that each complex\nexpression of natural language has semantic properties that are\ndetermined by (i) the semantic properties of its constituents, and\n(ii) the ways in which these constituents are grammatically arranged.\nIf this is correct, then following Davidson, one might say that the\nlogical forms of expressions (of some natural language) just are the\nstructures that determine the corresponding meanings given the\nrelevant word meanings; see Lepore and Ludwig (2002). In which case,\nthe phenomenon of valid inference may be largely a by-product of\nsemantic compositionality. If principles governing the meanings of\n(37\u201340) have the consequence that (40) is true iff an\nexistential claim like (40a) is true, perhaps this is illustrative of\nthe general case. Given a sentence of some natural language NL, the\ntask of specifying its logical form may be inseparable from the task\nof providing a compositional specification of what the sentences of NL\nmean.\n",
