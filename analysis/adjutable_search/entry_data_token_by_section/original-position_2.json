    "main_text": "The Veil of Ignorance\n3. The Veil of Ignorance\n\nRawls calls his conception \u201cjustice as fairness.\u201d His aim\nin designing the original position is to describe an agreement\nsituation that is fair among all the parties to the hypothetical\nsocial contract. He assumes that if the parties are fairly situated\nand take all relevant information into account, then the principles\nthey agree to are also fair. The fairness of the original agreement\nsituation transfers to the principles everyone agrees to; furthermore,\nwhatever laws or institutions are required by the principles of\njustice are also fair. The principles of justice chosen in the\noriginal position are in this way the result of a choice procedure\ndesigned to \u201cincorporate pure procedural justice at the highest\nlevel\u201d (CP, 310, cf. TJ 120/104). This feature of Rawls\u2019s\noriginal position is closely related to his constructivism, and his\nsubsequent understanding of the original position as a\n\u201cprocedure of construction\u201d; see the supplementary\nsection:\n\nConstructivism, Objectivity, Autonomy, and the Original Position,\n \n\nin the supplementary document\n Further Topics on the Original Position.\n\nThere are different ways to define a fair agreement situation\ndepending on the purpose of the agreement and the description of the\nparties to it. For example, certain facts are relevant to entering a\nfair employment contract \u2013 knowledge of a prospective\nemployee\u2019s talents, skills, prior training, experience,\nmotivation, and reliability \u2013 that may not be relevant to other\nfair agreements. What is a fair agreement situation among free and\nequal persons when the purpose of the agreement is fundamental\nprinciples of justice for the basic structure of society? What sort of\nfacts should the parties to such a fundamental social contract know,\nand what sort of facts are irrelevant or even prejudicial to a fair\nagreement? Here it is helpful to compare Rawls\u2019s and\nLocke\u2019s social contracts. A feature of Locke\u2019s social\ncontract is that it transpires in a state of nature among free and\nequal persons who know everything about themselves that you and I know\nabout ourselves and each other. Thus, Locke\u2019s parties know their\nnatural talents, skills, education, and other personal\ncharacteristics; their racial and ethnic group, gender, social class,\nand occupations; their level of wealth and income, their religious and\nmoral beliefs, and so on. Given this knowledge, Locke assumes that,\nwhile starting from a position of equal political right, the great\nmajority of free and equal persons in a state of nature \u2013\nincluding all women and racial minorities, and all other men who do\nnot meet a rigid property qualification \u2013 could and most likely\nwould rationally agree to alienate their natural rights of equal\npolitical jurisdiction in order to gain the benefits of political\nsociety. Thus, Locke envisions as legitimate a constitutional monarchy\nthat is in effect a gender-and-racially biased class state wherein a\nsmall restricted class of amply propertied white males exercise\npolitical rights to vote, hold office, exercise political and social\ninfluence, and enjoy other important benefits and responsibilities to\nthe exclusion of everyone else (see Rawls, LHPP, 138\u2013139).\n\nThe problem with this arrangement, of course, is that gender and\nracial classifications, social class, wealth and lack thereof, are,\nlike absence of religious belief, not good reasons for depriving free\nand equal persons of their equal political rights or opportunities to\noccupy social and political positions. Knowledge of these and other\nfacts are not then morally relevant for deciding who should qualify to\nvote, hold office, and actively participate in governing and\nadministering society. Rawls suggests that the reason Locke\u2019s\nsocial contract results in this unjust outcome is that it transpires\n(hypothetically) under unfair conditions of a state of nature, where\nthe parties have complete knowledge of their circumstances,\ncharacteristics and social situations. Socially powerful and wealthy\nparties then have access to and can unfairly benefit from their\nknowledge of their \u201cfavorable position and exercise their threat\nadvantage\u201d to extract favorable terms of cooperation for\nthemselves from those in less favorable positions (JF 16).\nConsequently, the parties\u2019 judgments regarding constitutional\nprovisions are biased by their knowledge of their particular\ncircumstances and their decisions are insufficiently impartial.\n\nThe remedy for such biases of judgment is to redefine the initial\nsituation within which the social contract transpires. Rather than a\nstate of nature Rawls situates the parties to the social contract so\nthat they do not have access to factual knowledge that can distort\ntheir judgments and result in unfair principles. Rawls\u2019s\noriginal position is an initial agreement situation wherein the\nparties are without information enabling them to tailor principles of\njustice favorable to their personal circumstances and interests. Among\nthe essential features of the original position are that no one knows\ntheir place in society, class position, wealth, or social status, nor\ndoes anyone know their race, gender, fortune or misfortune in the\ndistribution of natural assets and abilities, level of intelligence,\nstrength, education, and the like. Rawls even assumes that the parties\ndo not know their values or \u201cconceptions of the good,\u201d\ntheir religious or philosophical convictions, or their special\npsychological propensities. The principles of justice are chosen\nbehind a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d (TJ 12/11). This veil of\nignorance deprives the parties of all knowledge of particular facts\nabout themselves, about one another, and even about their society and\nits history.\n\nThe parties are not however completely ignorant of facts. They know\nall kinds of general facts about persons and societies, including\nknowledge of relatively uncontroversial scientific laws and\ngeneralizations accepted within the natural and social sciences\n\u2013 economics, psychology, political science, biology, and other\nnatural sciences (including applications of Darwinian evolutionary\ntheory that are generally accepted by scientists, however\ncontroversial they may be among religious fundamentalists). They know\nthen about the general tendencies of human behavior and psychological\ndevelopment, about neuropsychology and biological evolution, and about\nhow economic markets work, including neo-classical price theory of\nsupply and demand. As discussed below, they also know about the\ncircumstances of justice\u2014moderate scarcity and limited\naltruism\u2014as well as the desirability of the \u201cprimary\nsocial goods\u201d that are needed by anyone in modern society to\nlive a good life and to develop their \u201cmoral powers\u201d and\nother capacities. What the parties lack however is knowledge of any\nparticular facts about their own and other persons\u2019 lives, as\nwell as knowledge of any historical facts about their society and its\npopulation, its level of wealth and resources, religious institutions,\netc.. Rawls thinks that since the parties are required to come to an\nagreement on objective principles that supply universal standards of\njustice applying across all societies, knowledge of particular and\nhistorical facts about any person or society is morally irrelevant and\npotentially prejudicial to their decision.\n\nAnother reason Rawls gives for such a \u201cthick\u201d veil of\nignorance is that it is designed to be a strict \u201cposition of\nequality\u201d (TJ 12/11) that represents persons purely in their\ncapacity as free and equal moral persons. The parties in the original\nposition do not know any particular facts about themselves or society;\nthey all have the same general information. They are then situated\nequally in a very strong way, \u201csymmetrically\u201d (JF 18) and\npurely as free and equal moral persons. They know only characteristics\nand interests they share in their capacity as free and equal moral\npersons\u2014their \u201chigher-order interests\u201d in developing\nthe moral powers of justice and rationality, their need for the\nprimary social goods, and so on. The moral powers, Rawls contends, are\nthe \u201cbasis of equality, the features of human beings in virtue\nof which they are to be treated in accordance with the principles of\njustice\u201d (TJ, 504/441). Knowledge of the moral powers and their\nessential role in social cooperation, along with knowledge of other\ngeneral facts, is all that is morally relevant, Rawls believes, to a\ndecision on principles of justice that are to reflect people\u2019s\nstatus as free and equal moral persons. A thick veil of ignorance thus\nis designed to represent the equality of persons purely as moral\npersons, and not in any other contingent capacity or social role. In\nthis regard the veil of ignorance interprets the Kantian idea of\nequality as equal respect for moral persons (cf. CP 255).\n\nMany criticisms have been leveled against Rawls\u2019s veil of\nignorance. Among the more common criticisms are that the\nparties\u2019 choice in the original position is indeterminate (Sen,\n2009, 11\u201312, 56\u201358), or would result in choice of the\nprinciple of (average) utility (Harsanyi, 1975), or a principle of\nrelative prioritarianism that gives greater weight to but does not\nmaximize the least advantaged position (Buchak, 2017) (The argument\nfor the choice of the principle of average utility is discussed\nbelow.) Among reasons given for the indeterminacy of decision in the\noriginal position are that the parties are deprived of so much\ninformation about themselves that they are psychologically incapable\nof making a choice; or they cannot decide between a plurality of\nreasonable principles. (Sen 2009, 56\u201358). Or they are incapable\nof making a rational choice, since we cannot decide upon\nethical principles without knowing our primary purposes in life, the\nvalues of community, or certain other final ends and commitments.\n(MacIntyre, 1981; Sandel 1982)\n\nOne answer to to the criticism of inability to make a rational choice\ndue to ignorance of our final ends is that we do not need to know\neverything about ourselves, including these primary purposes, to make\nrational decisions about the background social conditions needed to\npursue these primary purposes. For example, whatever our ends, we know\nthat personal security and an absence of social chaos are conditions\nof most anyone\u2019s living a good life (as Hobbes contends).\nSimilarly, though Rawls\u2019s parties do not know their own values\nand commitments, they do know that as free and equal persons they\nrequire an adequate share of primary social goods (rights and\nliberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth, and the social\nbases of self-respect) to effectively pursue their purposes, whatever\nthey may be. They also know they have a \u201chigher-order\ninterest\u201d in adequately developing and exercising their\n\u201cmoral powers\u201d \u2013 the capacities to be rational and\nreasonable \u2013 which are conditions of responsible agency,\neffectively pursuing one\u2019s purposes, and engaging in social\ncooperation. Rawls contends that knowledge of these \u201cessential\ngoods\u201d is sufficient for a rational choice on principles of\njustice by the parties in the original position.\n\nTo the objection that choice behind the veil of ignorance is\npsychologically impossible, Rawls says that it is important not to get\ntoo caught up in the theoretical fiction of the original position, as\nif it were some historical event among real people who are being asked\nto do something impossible. The original position is not supposed to\nbe realistic but is a \u201cdevice of representation\u201d (PL 27),\nor a \u201cthought experiment,\u201d (JF, 83), that is designed to\norganize our considered convictions of justice and clarify their\nimplications. The parties in it are not real but are \u201cartificial\npersons\u201d who have a role to play in this thought experiment.\nThey represent an ideal of free and equal reasonable and rational\nmoral persons that Rawls assumes is implicit in our reasoning about\njustice. The veil of ignorance is a representation of the kinds of\nreasons and information that are relevant to a decision on principles\nof justice for the basic structure of a society of free and equal\nmoral persons (TJ 17/16). Many kinds of reasons and facts are not\nmorally relevant to that kind of decision (e.g., information about\npeople\u2019s race, gender, religious affiliation, wealth, and even,\nRawls says more controversially, their conceptions of their good),\njust as many different kinds of reasons and facts are irrelevant to\nmathematicians\u2019 ability to work out the formal proof of a\ntheorem. As a mathematician, scientist, or musician exercise their\nexpertise by ignoring knowledge of particular facts about themselves,\npresumably we can do so too in reasoning about principles of justice\nfor the basic structure of society. Rawls says we can \u201center the\noriginal position at any time simply by reasoning in accordance with\nthe enumerated restrictions on information,\u201d (PL 27) and\nconsidering general facts about persons, their needs, and social and\neconomic cooperation that are provided to the parties (TJ 120/104,\n587/514).\n\nA related criticism of Rawls\u2019s \u201cthick\u201d veil of\nignorance is that even if the parties can make certain rational\ndecisions in their interest without knowledge of their final ends,\nstill they cannot come to a decision about principles of justice\nwithout knowing the desires and interests of people. For justice\nconsists of the measures that most effectively promote good\nconsequences, and these ultimately reflect facts about\nindividuals\u2019 utility or welfare. This criticism is mirrored in\nutilitarian versions of the moral point of view, which incorporate a\n\u201cthin\u201d veil of ignorance that represents a different idea\nof impartiality. The impartial sympathetic spectator found in David\nHume and Adam Smith, or the self-interested rational chooser in John\nHarsanyi\u2019s average utilitarian account, all have complete\nknowledge of everyone\u2019s desires, interests and purposes as well\nas knowledge of particular facts about people and their historical\nsituations. Impartiality is achieved by depriving the impartial\nobserver or rational chooser of any knowledge of its own identity.\nThis leads it to give equal consideration to everyone\u2019s desires\nand interests, and impartially take everyone\u2019s desires and\ninterests into account. Since rationality is presumed to involve\nmaximizing something \u2013 or taking the most effective means to\npromote the greatest realization of one\u2019s ends \u2013 the\nimpartial observer/chooser rationally chooses the rule or course of\naction that maximizes the satisfaction of desires, or utility\n(aggregate or average), summed across all persons. (See TJ,\n\u00a730)\n\nRawls\u2019s original position with its \u201cthick\u201d veil of\nignorance represents a different conception of impartiality than the\nutilitarian requirement that equal consideration be given to\neveryone\u2019s desires, preferences, or interests. The original\nposition abstracts from all information about current circumstances\nand the status quo, including everyone\u2019s desires and particular\ninterests. Utilitarians assume peoples\u2019 desires and interests\nare given by their circumstances and seek to maximize their\nsatisfaction; in so doing utilitarians suspend judgment regarding the\nmoral permissibility of peoples\u2019 desires, preferences, and ends\nand of the social circumstances and institutions within which these\nare shaped and cultivated. For Rawls, a primary reason for a thick\nveil of ignorance is to enable an unbiased assessment of the justice\nof existing social and political institutions and of existing desires,\npreferences, and conceptions of the good that they sustain.\nPeople\u2019s desires and purposes are not then assumed to be given,\nwhatever they are, and then promoted and fulfilled. On Rawls\u2019s\nKantian view, principles of right and justice are designed to put\nlimits on what satisfactions and purposes have value and impose\nrestrictions on what are reasonable conceptions of persons\u2019\ngood. This basically is what Rawls means by \u201cthe priority of\nright over the good.\u201d People\u2019s desires and\naspirations are constrained from the outset by principles of justice,\nwhich specify the criteria for determining permissible ends and\nconceptions of the good. (TJ 31\u201332/27\u201328) If the parties\nto Rawls\u2019s original position had knowledge of peoples\u2019\nbeliefs and desires, as well as knowledge of the laws, institutions\nand circumstances of their society, then this knowledge would\ninfluence their decisions on principles of justice. The principles\nagreed to would then not be sufficiently detached from the very\ndesires, circumstances, and institutions these principles are to\ncritically assess. Since utilitarians take peoples\u2019 desires,\npreferences, and/or ends as given under existing circumstances, any\nprinciples, laws, or institutions chosen behind their thin veil of\nignorance will reflect and be biased by the status quo. To take an\nobvious counterexample, there is little if any justice in laws\napproved from a utilitarian impartial perspective when these laws take\ninto account racially prejudiced preferences which are cultivated by\ngrossly unequal, racially discriminatory and segregated social\nconditions. To impartially give equal consideration to\neveryone\u2019s desires formed under such under unjust conditions is\nhardly sufficient to meet requirements of justice. This illustrates\nsome of the reasons for a \u201cthick\u201d as opposed to a\n\u201cthin\u201d veil of ignorance.\n",
