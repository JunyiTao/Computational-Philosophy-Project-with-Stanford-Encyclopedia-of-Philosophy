    "main_text": "The Frankfurt School: Origins, Influences, and Development || Critical Theory versus Traditional Theory\n1.3 Critical Theory versus Traditional Theory\n\nOne largely undisputed reference for defining Frankfurt School\ncritical theory is Horkheimer\u2019s 1937 essay \u201cTraditional\nand Critical Theory,\u201d in which he defines critical theory by\ncontrasting it with traditional theories that take the existing social\norder as given. Social sciences do this, for example, when they model\nthemselves after the natural sciences in attempting to descriptively\nmirror a given set of facts or establish law-like generalizations. The\npoint is not that empirical social research is invalid, but that\ntraditional theories fail to analyze the broader social context in\nwhich they are embedded. This form of \u201cpositivism\u201d views\nscience as a purely theoretical undertaking divorced from practical\ninterests even while it actually serves a particular social function\nin relying on established concepts and categories in a way that\nreinforces dominant ideologies and power structures. In that way, the\nforms of knowledge production that we rely on for insight into the\nsocial order become obstacles to social change.\n\nCritical theory, by contrast, reflects on the context of its own\norigins and aims to be a transformative force within that context. It\nexplicitly embraces an interdisciplinary methodology that aims to\nbridge the gap between empirical research and the kind of\nphilosophical thinking needed to grasp the overall historical\nsituation and mediate between specialized empirical disciplines.\nCritical theory aims not merely to describe social reality, but to\ngenerate insights into the forces of domination operating within\nsociety in a way that can inform practical action and stimulate\nchange. It aims to unite theory and practice, so that the theorist\nforms \u201ca dynamic unity with the oppressed class\u201d (1937a\n[1972, 215]) that is guided by an emancipatory interest \u2013\ndefined negatively as an interest in the \u201cabolition of social\ninjustice\u201d (ibid., 242) and positively as an interest in\nestablishing \u201creasonable conditions of life\u201d (ibid., 199).\n\u201cThe theory never aims simply at an increase of knowledge as\nsuch,\u201d but at \u201cemancipation from slavery\u201d (1937b\n[1972, 246]) in the broadest sense of eliminating all forms of\ndomination. The critique of traditional social science was further\ndeveloped by Adorno and Habermas in the so-called positivism dispute\nin German sociology (Adorno et al. 1969, Wellmer 1969) and\nHorkheimer\u2019s model of critical theory continues to inform\ndiscussions about how social critique might be carried out today in a\nvariety of contexts (Outlaw 2005, Collins 2019, 57\u201365).\n",
