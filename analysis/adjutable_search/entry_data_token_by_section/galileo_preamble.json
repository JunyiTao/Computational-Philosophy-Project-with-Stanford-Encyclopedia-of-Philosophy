    "main_text": "\n\nGalileo Galilei (1564\u20131642) has always played a key role in any\nhistory of science, as well as many histories of philosophy. He is\na\u2014if not the\u2014central figure of the Scientific\nRevolution of the seventeenth century. His work in physics (or\n\u201cnatural philosophy\u201d), astronomy, and the methodology of\nscience still evoke debate after more than 400 years. His role in\npromoting the Copernican theory and his travails and trials with the\nRoman Church are stories that still require re-telling. This article\nattempts to provide an overview of these aspects of Galileo\u2019s\nlife and work, but does so by focusing in a new way on his arguments\nconcerning the nature of matter.\n",
