    "main_text": "Key Domains Addressed by Social Ontology || Race, Gender, and Disability\n5.4 Race, Gender, and Disability\n\nMuch recent interest in social ontology has been sparked by new\napproaches to race, gender, disability, and related social categories.\nHistorically, erroneous ontological claims have contributed to and\nbeen used to justify social oppression. Claims about the genetic\nnature of race, for instance, are historically tied to claims about\nintellectual, character, and cultural differences between racial\ngroups. Likewise, claims about the nature of gender differences are\nhistorically tied to claims about how women ought to behave.\n\nControversy over race categories, gender categories, and other\ncategories, pertains both to their construction and their essential\nproperties. The term \u2018essentialism\u2019, as applied to\ncategories such as race and gender, has a different meaning than it\ndoes in mainstream metaphysics. As applied to race, for instance,\n\u2018essentialism\u2019 is often understood as synonymous with\n\u2018biological essentialism\u2019\u2014the view that races have\nsimple, natural, and heritable biological properties, such that every\nmember of a racial group has that biological property. This should not\nbe confused with a metaphysical claim that might be made by a social\nconstructivist proposing a \u201csocial essence\u201d of race: for\ninstance, a claim that membership in a racial group essentially\ninvolves identifying with other people for reasons of solidarity, or\nthat it involves being descended from a historically and\ngeographically situated population. Such a theorist would flatly deny\n\u201cessentialism\u201d in the old sense, which still analyzing the\n(socially set up) essential properties of race (for a critique of\nessentialism, see Phillips 2010; see also entry on\n race).\n\nEliminativists argue that biological essentialism in the old sense is\ninseparable from our racial categories, so debunking racist views\nimplies that racial categories are an illusion: there are no races\n(Appiah 1985, 1994; Zack 1994, 1995). A different set of approaches\nmaintains that races are social kinds without having simple biological\nessences. Among these are historico-geographic theories,\ngenetic-bundle theories, identity theories, etc. (see Bernasconi &\nLott 2000, Zack 2002, Glasgow 2009). Other theories hold that although\nsimple biological theories are false, racial differences can be\nidentified using the methods of population biology (Andreasen 1998,\nKitcher 2007, Hardimon 2012; see also Kaplan & Winther 2014). In\nthe face of competing conceptions of race, some theorists propose\npluralism about race-like kinds (Hochman 2013, McPherson 2015). In\nmany theories of race, bi-racialism and multi-racialism have been\ntreated as boundary or marginal cases. Others argue, on the contrary,\nthat multiracialism is central to the construction of racial\ncategories (see Alcoff, Sundstrom et al. 2016).\n\nIn some ways, questions pertaining to the metaphysics of sex and\ngender resemble those pertaining to race: historically, descriptive\nand normative categories were conflated in simplistic biological\ntheories. An important difference between sex/gender and race,\nhowever, concerns the distinction between sex and gender (Beauvoir\n1949, West & Zimmerman 1987). Many theorists propose that sexes\nare biological categories and that genders are categories of social\nnorms and behaviors that are traditionally attached to sexes. However,\nother theorists argue that it is incorrect to regard sex as biological\n(Fausto-Sterling 2000, Butler 2004). Thus in the case of sex/gender,\nthere are arguably multiple socially constructed categories that\ninteract with one another; and some theorists reject the distinction\nbetween sex and gender (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender).\n\nA question pertaining to racial and gender categories alike is whether\nthese are descriptively adequate categories in the first place. Many\nof the political phenomena associated with differential treatment of\ngroups and oppression cut across lines of race, gender, and class.\nSome theorists of intersectionality argue that it is misleading to\nregard standard gender and racial groups as if they were unified (see\nCrenshaw 1991, McCall 2005, Jones 2014).\n\nA central problem in the ontology of race, gender, and other\ncategories is that how we categorize not only has ethical\nimplications, but is affected by ethically-laden facts. Some theorists\nchallenge the idea of a purely descriptive analysis of such groups.\nOthers propose that there can be descriptive analyses, but that such\nanalyses are a stepping stone to ethically preferable categories.\nHaslanger (2000, 2012) in particular has argued for the\n\u201cameliorative\u201d analysis of racial and gender categories.\nPart of the role of social ontology is to analyze the concepts and\ncategories that are \u201coperative\u201d in a social system, but an\nequally important aim is to explore how we might otherwise construct\nsocial categories with the aim of social improvement. Barnes (2016)\nargues for an ameliorative account of disability (see entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience).\n",
