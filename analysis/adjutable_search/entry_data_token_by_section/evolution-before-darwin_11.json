    "main_text": "Early Nineteenth-Century Transformism\n4. Early Nineteenth-Century Transformism\n\nBy the early nineteenth century, one can follow several lines of\nreflection admitting some form of species transformism and a\nhistorical development of life. In the Germanies, Herder\u2019s\nreflections formed a major ingredient in the development of German\nNaturphilosophie and \u201cRomantic\u201d science that was\nexpanded in the writings of Johann Goethe (1749\u20131832),\nFriederich Schelling (1775\u20131854), Gottfried Treviranus\n(1776\u20131837) and several others who advocated some version of a\nhistorically progressive philosophy of nature with at least the\n\u201cdevelopment\u201d if not actual transformism of species in\ntime (Zammito 2018: chps. 8,9,11; R. J. Richards 2002: chps. 2, 3, 8).\nIn the British Isles in the same period, the reflections in the second\nvolume of his Zoonomia, or the Laws of Organic Life\n(1794\u20131796) of Erasmus Darwin (1731\u20131802), grandfather of\nCharles Darwin, offered a theory of species development based on a\nconcept of dynamic living matter. These multiple lines of late\neighteenth-century reflection advocating some form of a general\ntransformism of species and a history of living nature, each of which\ncan be followed out in detail, can be differentiated from the\ninstitutional framework of discussion established in France after\nBuffon at the Mus\u00e9um nationale d\u2019histoire\nnaturelle in Paris, the post-Revolutionary successor to the\nJardin du roi. These institutional developments supplied a\nnew precision and a concrete material context for the professional\ndiscussion of transformist question as it emerged in the nineteenth\ncentury. This institutional framework of French discussion will be\nemphasized in the following while acknowledging the broader context of\ndiscussion outside of France. \n\nBuffon\u2019s leadership of the Jardin ended with his death\nin April of 1788 on the edge of the massive social, political and\nscientific changes that were to overtake France a year later. As the\nonly major French scientific organization to survive the dismantling\nof all other institutions of privilege by the National Convention in\nthe summer of 1793, the reconstituted and reorganized\nMus\u00e9um nationale d\u2019histoire naturelle provided\nan unusual context for the further development of transformist\ntheories (Blanckaert et al. [eds] 1997). In its new form, the\nMus\u00e9um created an institutional context in which\nseveral aspects of Buffon\u2019s grand undertaking in natural history\ncould be refined and deepened in the decades following his death\n(Corsi 1983 [1988: chp. 1]). In the Revolutionary context of the new\nRepublic, the work of Linnaeus and his classificatory approach to\nnatural history, admired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but overshadowed\nbefore 1789 by the authority of Buffon, was elevated at the\nMus\u00e9um to a new level of authority. The two rival\nleaders of natural history in effect became for the French naturalists\nwhat George Cuvier (1769\u20131832) later described as \u201ctwo\nfounts\u201d from which they jointly drew their inspiration.\n\nThe Revolutionary reorganization of the Jardin also created a\nnew kind of specialization of research and disciplinary division\nwithin what had previously been conceived of as \u201cnatural\nhistory\u201d. The reorganization of 1793 established within the\nMus\u00e9um twelve separate Chairs of equal status that\ngave specific individuals control over portions of the collections and\nthe research work done within these divisions that instituted new\ndisciplinary specializations within natural history. \u201cMammals\nand Birds\u201d were placed under Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire\n(1772\u20131844). \u201cReptiles and Fishes\u201d were assigned to\nBuffon\u2019s understudy Bernard de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de\n(1756\u20131825). \u201cHuman Anatomy\u201d was given to Antoine\nPortal (1742\u20131832). The creation of a new Chair of Comparative\nAnatomy, with an attendant separate museum established in 1802,\nprovided the position for the young Alsatian zoologist Georges Cuvier\n(1769\u20131832). The large conglomerate of forms, known previously\nonly as \u201cWorms\u201d (Vers), was placed under the\ncontrol of Buffon\u2019s one-time understudy Jean Baptiste Pierre\nAntoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck (1744\u20131829). Other chairs\nin botany, paleontology, comparative physiology, and anthropology were\nestablished, or would be developed in the nineteenth century. All\nthese new institutional structures subdivided traditional\n\u201cnatural history\u201d, and facilitated professionalized\ninquiries into specific areas of life science that related to the\nnature of species, the interpretations of the classificatory systems,\nand to the history and biogeography of the earth (Corsi 1983 [1988:\nchp. 1]; Appel 1987).\n",
