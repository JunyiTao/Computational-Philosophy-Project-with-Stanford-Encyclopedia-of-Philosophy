    "main_text": "Civil Association\n5. History and the Human Sciences\n\n\nBy distinguishing between thinking to understand and thinking to act,\nOakeshott aims to protect historical, scientific, and philosophical\ninquiry from the imperialism of practical concerns. This aim is\nevident in his treatment of historical inquiry, especially in his\nconcern to distinguish the idea of a distinctively historical past\nfrom what he calls \u201cthe practical past\u201d. Genuine\nhistorical inquiry is concerned to establish what happened, not to\nelicit knowledge that speaks to present concerns. It is indifferent to\n\u201cthe lessons of history\u201d (EM 316) or \u201cthe\nliving past\u201d (OH 19). His point is not that past\nexperience cannot guide, but that the past that is supposed to guide\nis not a \u201chistorical\u201d past. Nor is it the business of\nhistorical inquiry to generate stories about the direction of\nhistory. Books about the progress of the human mind (Condorcet) or the\nend of history (Fukuyama) written from the standpoint of the\nauthor\u2019s own time do not observe the modal conditions of\nhistorical thought but are instead works of what Herbert Butterfield\n(1931) called \u201cWhig history\u201d\u2014history designed to\nratify, if not glorify, the present. A similar point can be made about\nstories of decline. By detaching historical knowledge from present\nconcerns, Oakeshott articulates a theory of history as a distinct mode\nof inquiry and understanding. \n\n\nImplicit in these claims for the autonomy of historical inquiry is a\ndistinction between naturalistic and hermeneutic ways of understanding\nhuman affairs. Oakeshott uses the word \u201cconduct\u201d to\nidentify human choice and action, contrasting it with behavior\nexplained as the outcome of natural processes. Unlike natural\nphenomena, human conduct involves ideas. And unlike the natural\nsciences, the \u201chuman sciences\u201d\n(Geisteswissenchaften, the sciences of mind as a body of\nideas) require interpreting ideas, especially those that shape\nintentional and self-conscious action. The human sciences are, in\nfact, doubly interpretive because they interpret human conduct, which\nis itself an activity that involves making and acting on\ninterpretations. And when they go beyond generalizing about human\nconduct to explaining particular acts, the explanations they provide\nare \u201chistorical\u201d explanations. \n\n\nIn making these points Oakeshott draws on late nineteenth- and early\ntwentieth-century German thinking about the study of history,\nespecially the anti-positivism of Windelband, Rickert, and\nDilthey. Their arguments rest on a distinction between the realms of\nhuman freedom and natural necessity articulated by Vico, Kant, and\nHegel, among others. Understanding human conduct in terms of thought\nand action can nevertheless be scientific\u2014that is,\nsystematic\u2014in its own manner. Such an inquiry might focus on\nwhat Hegel called \u201cobjective spirit\u201d, shared ideas\nexpressed in languages, moral traditions, and other practices that\nrequire interpretation. But it might also focus on individual\nperformances: particular acts, ideas, judgments, arguments, and other\nproducts of thinking. In either case, the disciplines of the\nhumanities and humanistic social sciences are concerned with the\ncontent of thinking\u2014ideas\u2014not the natural processes that\nmake thinking possible (VLL 23\u201324). This claim is at\nodds with how the social sciences are widely understood and especially\nwith much in the disciplines of psychology and cognitive science. \n \nIf separating the social sciences from the humanities is a\nmistake, Oakeshott thinks, another is to imagine that the word\n\u201csocial\u201d designates a subject for\ninvestigation. Sociology, he argues, is not a discipline with its own\nsubject matter; it is what remains when disciplines such as economics\nand psychology have claimed certain aspects of human activity as their\nown. The study of a residual category cannot be a genuine discipline,\nnor is there any general science of society that grounds the\nconclusions of economics, psychology, and the other social\nsciences. What are loosely called social relationships are actually\nrelationships in terms of specific practices\u2014habits, customs,\nrules, and roles\u2014that prescribe considerations of utility or\npropriety in acting. They are not, as Oakeshott thought sociologists\nwere inclined to assume, \n\n\ncomponents of an unspecified, unconditional interdependence or\n\u201csocial\u201d relationship, something called a\n\u201csociety\u201d or \u201cSociety\u201d. (VLL 24)\n\n \nThis is not a point about nomenclature but a claim that a proper\ndiscipline has boundaries that enable a coherent inquiry. For\nOakeshott, the category that defines coherent inquiry into human\nconduct is not \u201csocial\u201d but\n\u201cintelligent\u201d. Intelligence, here, is not the quality of\nbeing bright or stupid but of having agency, the capacity to think and\nchoose. An excavated object is either a manifestation of intelligence\n(an inscribed tablet) or not (a rock). In making this distinction, he\nis not suggesting that the experienced world is made up of two kinds\nof things but rather that we experience the world differently\naccording to the categories of understanding that we bring to it. For\nan understanding to be coherent, it must distinguish between the\nintelligent and the not-intelligent because these categories are\nmutually exclusive. Propositions about the biochemistry of thinking\ncannot explain the cognitive content of a person\u2019s thoughts. No\ninquiry can generate a self-consistent body of knowledge if its\nobjects are categorially ambiguous. These claims restate\nOakeshott\u2019s point that cross-modal arguments are necessarily\nincoherent. Much of social science is undermined by efforts to\nunderstand intelligent conduct as the product of not-intelligent\nphysiological, psychological, or social processes seen as natural,\nthat is, operating independently of understanding. Such efforts cannot\ngenerate genuine knowledge because they involve a categorial\nerror. Coherent explanation is impossible when \n\n\nrules are misidentified as regularities, intelligent winks as\nphysiological blinks, conduct as \u201cbehavior\u201d and contingent\nrelationships as causal or systematic connections. (VLL\n26)\n\n \nThoughts and actions can be explained, but only historically, not\nscientifically. Oakeshott is here deliberately breaking with the view\nthat explanations are always \u201ccausal\u201d explanations that\ninvoke scientific laws. Historical explanations presuppose a\ndistinctively historical conception of causation. An argument, choice,\nor judgment made by a particular agent at a particular moment is an\nindividual performance, an event. Scientific psychology can generalize\nabout how people are likely to act but it cannot explain particular\nchoices, which may fail to illustrate the generalizations. And the\nreason for this limitation is not only the categorial impossibility of\nexplaining meanings in terms of statistical patterns or natural\nprocesses but also the gap between observed generalizations and\nparticular acts. The generalizations about human nature or social\nconditions found, confirmed, and relied upon by social scientists,\nthough often illuminating, cannot explain the occurrence of particular\nacts, which viewed as intelligent human conduct are always\nperformances in relation to some practice. The social sciences aim to\nfind causal relationships between variables such as age or income, and\nto offer explanations in terms of these relationships rather than\nintelligent choice. Such explanations are possible, but what they\nexplain is variance in the data, not particular performances. \n \nExplaining particular acts, Oakeshott argues, is\n\u201chistorical\u201d explanation, which as he understands it is\ncategorially distinct from scientific explanation. An observed pattern\nin the data, a statistical generalization, identifies a type of\naction. A performance, in contrast, is the choice of an actual agent\nat a particular moment. Science as a generalizing mode of inquiry aims\nto explain types of events, not particular occurrences. The humanities\nand humanistic social sciences, in contrast, are concerned with\nparticular acts or other individual objects. The individuality of an\nact is explained historically by relating it to antecedent events that\nled to its occurrence as an act with its particular\ncharacteristics. An individual act is one in a series of acts, each of\nwhich has meaning in relation to acts that preceded it. It is these\nantecedent acts, or some of them, that illuminate its unique\ncharacter. Only explanations of this kind are properly historical,\nOakeshott argues. \n \nThis account of historical explanation departs sharply from a\npositivist theory like the covering law model (Hempel 1942; Nagel\n1961) because it holds that a historical explanation aims to explain\nnot just the occurrence of an event but its cognitive significance,\nwhich Oakeshott calls its \u201ccharacter\u201d. Unlike scientific\nexplanations, which postulate repeatable events, historical\nexplanations postulate events that are individual and\nunique. Positivist theories of historical explanation get things\nbackward by assuming that the event to be explained is already\nunderstood as an instance of a type of event, but the historian cannot\nmake this assumption. Historical inquiry is not an exercise in\nexplaining an event whose character is known in advance of the effort\nto explain it. This character has yet to be established, and it can be\nestablished only by showing how antecedent events led to it rather\nthan some other event. The relationship between an antecedent and a\nsubsequent event is a \u201ccontingent\u201d one in which the\nmeaning of the subsequent is illuminated by the antecedent.\n \nOakeshott\u2019s conclusion that history is central to the human\nsciences results from reflection on the limitations of the natural and\nsocial sciences in explaining individual performances. Scholars in the\nhumanities and humanistic social sciences typically interpret such\nperformances in relation to historical practices such as religious\nceremonies, musical genres, culinary traditions, or legal procedures,\neach of which may be understood as a \u201clanguage\u201d of human\nperformance. But the understanding thereby gained is incomplete,\nOakeshott argues, because what it reveals is not the individuality of\na performance but rather its \u201cconventionality\u201d (OHC\n99\u2013100), the type of conduct it illustrates. As explanation,\nthis kind of interpretation help to understand contexts, situations,\nand types of action (practices), but it cannot explain the occurrence\nof particular acts (performances): why a particular person did such\nand such a thing on this or that occasion.\n\n\nGiven Oakeshott's view of the importance of history among the human\nsciences, the sustained attention that he devoted to it is not\nsurprising. History is the first mode he considers in Experience\nand its Modes and he returns to the topic often in later\nwritings. History as a mode of thought is not a record of past events\nbut a distinct way of identifying and explaining them. The task of the\nphilosophy of history, as Oakeshott sees it, is to clarify what\ndistinguishes historical from other kinds of inquiry. Historical\ninvestigation cannot simply record historical events because what is\nidentified as an event depends on evidence, and what counts as\nevidence must itself be established. The point, fundamental to the\nmodern discipline of critical history, was made in 1852 by Gustav\nDroysen, who argued that \n\n\nthe data for historical investigation are not past things, for these\nhave disappeared, but things which are still present here and now,\nwhether recollections of what was done, or remnants of things that\nhave existed and of events that have occurred. (Droysen 1893: 11) \n\n\n\nThe historian begins not with the past itself but with survivals from\nthe past that need to be authenticated and interpreted before they can\nbe used as evidence. A historical fact is not simply given. It is a\nconclusion: not \u201cwhat really happened\u201d but \u201cwhat the\nevidence obliges us to believe\u201d (EM 112). We identify\nas historical facts the conclusions that our investigations best\nsupport. The task of historical inquiry is to establish historical\nknowledge, according to the canons of the historian\u2019s craft,\nfrom evidence that is always scattered, unreliable, and open to\ninterpretation.\n\n\nHistorical knowledge, as Oakeshott sees it, can therefore be said to\nbe constructed. The ideas (\u201cidentities\u201d) that the\nhistorian uses to organize an inquiry\u2014the Renaissance, India,\nthe Dreyfus affair\u2014are designated, not discovered. And they are\nchanging, not immutable, identities that dissolve under scrutiny into\ncollections of events, which are themselves identities. They are not\ngivens but organizing ideas that are themselves open to\nreconsideration. Historical explanation means illuminating the\ncircumstantial meaning of an event in relation to its antecedents,\nwhich in a genuinely historical inquiry are always events and never\nscientific laws or processes. In a historical explanation, an event to\nbe explained is made intelligible as the outcome of what the evidence\nsuggests are the relevant antecedents. In this theory, which Oakeshott\ndevelops in the second of three late essays on historical inquiry\n(OH 45\u201396), a particular historical past appears as a\ncollection of contingently related events, often presented as a\nstory. But not necessarily: he disagrees with the view, which was\ngaining adherents at the time he was writing, that what distinguishes\nhistorical from other kinds of explanations is that they take the form\nof a narrative (Ankersmit 1983; Danto 2007). Historians do frequently\nconstruct narratives, but a narrative is not the only way to present\nhistorical knowledge. \n \nIf historical knowledge is a construction, it follows that what we\nidentify as the past is actually present because it is what the\nevidence supports now. Historical facts are present because all facts\nare present, that is, exist as conclusions within a present body of\nknowledge. A historical past is constructed according to what present\nevidence\u2014an object, such as an axe, diary, painting, or coin,\nthat has survived and is treated as evidence\u2014compels the\nhistorian to believe. Nor is this historical past the only possible\nkind of past: if there is a historical past then there must be other,\nnon-historical, pasts constructed in modes other than the historical\n(OH 9). Of these, Oakeshott is particularly concerned with what he\ncalls the practical past because of the difficulty of distinguishing\nit from a past resulting from historical inquiry: \n\n \neven the most severely \u201chistorical\u201d concern with the\npast is still liable to be compromised by seeking the answer to\nquestions which are not historical questions and by asides and even\njudgments which belong to some other mode of understanding. (OH\n118)\n\n\n\nA scientific past, such as what happened during the first three\nminutes of the existence of our universe, must also be distinguished\nfrom the historical past. Cosmologists might learn something about\nthis past by running their equations backward, but historians have no\nequations to run. \n \nWhat is distinctive about Oakeshott\u2019s conception of\nhistorical inquiry can be brought out by comparing it with\nR.G. Collingwood\u2019s claim that the historian\u2019s proper task\nis to reenact the past (Collingwood 1993 [1946]: 282\u2013302). That\nclaim makes historical truth subjective by requiring that the\nhistorian reconstruct past events as they were experienced by those\nwho participated in them. But this privileges the understandings of\nthe participants, who may not have understood or even known what was\nhappening. Their ideas are important in constructing a past but are\nnot everything we need to know to understand it. To argue otherwise is\nto argue that the historian is barred from having any ideas about a\ngiven past that \u201cwould have been impossible for anyone who lived\nin that past\u201d (Oakeshott 2008: 49). Oakeshott also rejects\nCollingwood\u2019s claim that \u201call philosophy is the philosophy\nof history\u201d (Collingwood 1993 [1926]: 425) because it makes\nphilosophy, and by implication all knowledge, subservient to\nhistorical knowledge (Oakeshott 2007: 199). Collingwood\u2019s\nargument for the primacy of history (historicism) is as reductionist\nas arguments for the primacy of science (scientism) or practice\n(pragmatism). The argument that one kind of understanding is the\nfoundation of other kinds assumes the truth of what it sets out to\nprove. Historical inquiry constructs knowledge from what it concludes\nto be evidence. It does not provide knowledge of a given, pre-modal\nreality. If historical pasts are intellectual constructions, there is\nno access to these pasts except through historical inquiry.\n",
