The Common Good in Civic Life: Burden Sharing and Resource Pooling\n\nMany philosophers agree that citizens must transcend their private\nconcerns when they take part in the political process. But some\nphilosophers believe that there are other aspects of social life in\nwhich citizens have a relational obligation to transcend their private\nconcerns. Two especially prominent examples in the literature involve\nburden sharing and resource pooling. Michael Walzer\u2019s discussion\nof conscription and national defense highlights several important\nissues (1983: 64\u201371, 78\u201391, 97\u20139, and 168\u201370;\nsee also Walzer 1970).\n\nWhen a foreign power threatens the constitutional order in a liberal\ndemocracy, political morality seems to direct citizens to defend the\norder in a particular way. Citizens must approach national defense as\na communal enterprise in which they organize themselves to achieve\na certain common level of security together through various forms of burden\nsharing and resource pooling. Burden sharing, in this case, requires\nevery member of the community to participate in some way in carrying\nthe collective burden of fighting the threat. Some citizens will do\nthe actual fighting, but others will contribute by treating the\nwounded, developing weapons, taking care of children, sending care\npackages to soldiers, rationing essential resources, and so on.\n\nThe moral importance of burden sharing comes out most clearly when we\nconsider certain highly privatized ways of organizing national\ndefense.  Consider, for example, a market based approach. A political\ncommunity might allow entrepreneurs to set up \u201cprotection\nagencies\u201d that would act as firms, hiring mercenaries, buying\nweapons, and selling varying levels of protection to individual\ncitizens based on their preferences and their ability to pay (see\nNozick 1974). Even if it were possible to defend people\u2019s\nconstitutional liberties through a mechanism of this\nkind,[21]\npolitical morality seems to rule it out. One reason is that the market\nscheme would allow citizens who are wealthy enough to buy protection\nservices for themselves, but then leave it to others to face the\nactual dangers of combat. This would violate the communal ideal that\nall citizens must share in some way in carrying the collective burden\nof defending the community (see Walzer 1983: 98\u20139 and 169).\n\nAnother problem with a highly privatized approach to national defence\nhas to do with the injured. When soldiers get injured in combat, their\ninjuries have a different moral status as compared to the injuries\nthat they might suffer if they decide to do things as private\nindividuals like ride a motorcycle or work in a circus. The difference\nis that combat injuries are not private injuries that\ncitizens must bear as private persons. Even in the case where soldiers\nvolunteer for combat, they perform a public service and we treat their\ninjuries as part of a collective burden that the community as a whole\nmust bear, e.g., by providing medical care and rehabilitation services\nto the wounded free of charge.\n\nThe communal ideal of public service and burden sharing might extend\nbeyond national defence to other forms of socially necessary work that\nis difficult or dangerous.\n\n\nMiners today are free citizens, but we might think of them\u2026as\ncitizens in the service of the nation. And then we might treat them as\nif they were conscripts, not sharing their risks, but sharing the\ncosts of the remedy: research into mine safety, health care designed\nfor their immediate needs, early retirement, decent pensions, and so\non. (Walzer 1983: 170)\n\n\nA more extensive application of the communal ideal might require\ncitizens to treat the burdens associated with other occupations as\nparts of a shared social burden, including the burdens faced by police\nofficers, firefighters, teachers, day care workers, nurses, nursing\nhome workers, and so on (cf. Brennan & Jaworski 2015).\n\nBesides burden sharing, resource pooling is another way that citizens\nmay organize their activities in light of the common good. Many\nfacilities in a modern liberal democracy serve common interests,\nincluding the armed forces, public health services, and the education\nsystem. These facilities require material resources, and this raises\nan array of questions about how to generate these resources and\nincorporate them into the pool of assets that serve common\ninterests.\n\nAristotle favors an approach that works through private ownership. In\nPlato\u2019s Republic, almost all of the resources held by\nthe guardians are held as collective assets that the guardians\nmay use for the sake of the common interest of the\n community.[22]\n Importantly, because the guardians hold almost nothing as private\nproperty, they do nothing that is analogous to the choices that a group of\nfriends might make on a camping trip to voluntarily pool their\nresources for the sake of common interests. In other words, the\nguardians do not express their concern for the members of the\ncommunity through gifts, donations or other forms of private\ncontribution. Partly for this reason, Aristotle favors an arrangement\nin which citizens have private ownership and control over assets and a\ncivic obligation to pool these assets for the sake of common interests\n(see Kraut 2002: 327\u201356). For example, if the community faces a\nnaval threat, wealthy citizens in Aristotle\u2019s ideal community\nwould be responsible for building warships and contributing these\nships to the war effort.\n\nAristotle\u2019s view draws attention to an important set of\nquestions in contemporary market societies. The civic obligation he\nhas in mind comes closest to our notion of private philanthropy. But\nis private philanthropy really the right way for a community to\nmaintain common facilities for the sake of common interests? In 2015,\nMark Zuckerberg, the billionaire founder of Facebook, announced that\nhe would donate 99% of his shares in the company to charitable causes,\nincluding public education (Kelly 2015). From Aristotle\u2019s point\nof view, this reflects well on our society: our institutions put\nwealth in private hands, thereby allowing citizens to make meaningful\nchoices to pool their wealth for common interests. But many would\nargue that our arrangements are seriously defective insofar\nas they put some individuals in a position to control a private\nfortune worth over $45 billion, even if these individuals will\neventually devote these resources to common interests. Plato is on to\nsomething when he says that political solidarity requires that social\ninstitutions channel some wealth directly into the public domain. But\nPlato seems to go too far in the other direction, and this leaves us\nwith an important set of questions about when society should pool\nresources through the state and when society should pool resources\nthrough private philanthropy.\n",
