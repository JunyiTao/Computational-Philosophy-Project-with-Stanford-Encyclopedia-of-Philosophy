    "main_text": "Moral Objections || All-things-considered Obligations\n6.3 All-things-considered Obligations\n\nMany authors have argued that skeptical theism leads to skepticism\nabout our obligations (see Jordan 2006: 409ff; Piper 2007: 68; Sehon\n2010; Maitzen 2013: 448\u2013451; Street 2014). Skeptical theists can\nbe reasonable in believing that certain things are good and bad; and\nskeptical theists can be reasonable in believing that agents have\ncertain pro tanto obligations (e.g. to bring about what is\ngood, prevent what is bad, keep our promises, etc.). But oftentimes in\nordinary life we take ourselves to reasonably believe\u2014if not\nknow\u2014what we ought to do, what our\nall-things-considered obligations are. And some authors argue\nthat skeptical theism leads to skepticism about our\nall-things-considered obligations.\n\nThe simplest form of this objection assumes maximizing act\nconsequentialism. According to that view, an agent ought to act to\nbring about the outcomes with the greatest possible good. However, if\nskeptical theists cannot be reasonable in forming beliefs about the\nall-things-considered value of outcomes, then they cannot be\nreasonable in believing which outcomes have the greatest possible\ngood. Thus, assuming maximizing act consequentialism, skeptical\ntheists cannot be reasonable in believing some action is the one they\nought to perform. But, arguably, skeptical theism leads to skepticism\nabout our all-things-considered obligations assuming other moral\ntheories as well. For instance, some robust forms of virtue ethics\nsuggest that agents ought to perform the action that a perfectly\nvirtuous person would perform; but presumably a perfectly virtuous\nperson would not neglect salient outcomes of their actions. Similarly,\nsome forms of Kantian ethics test moral principles by considering\nwhether \u201cuniversalizing\u201d them in various ways results in\nsome kind of contradiction; but presumably determining whether there\nis some kind of contradiction requires knowing the various outcomes of\nactions in those hypothetical scenarios.\n\nSkeptical theists might respond by drawing a distinction between\nconsiderations relevant to God\u2019s action and our own (compare\nHoward-Snyder 1996b: 292-3; Bergmann 2009: 393; Jeffrey 2019: section\n3.1.3). For all we know, our knowledge of good and evil is not\nrepresentative when it comes to considerations that determine what God\nought to do; but it may be that our knowledge of good and evil is\nrepresentative when it comes to considerations that determine what\nhumans ought to do. While this response may be promising, skeptical\ntheists haven\u2019t developed it at great lengths, and some critics\n(notably Street 2014) have argued it is less promising than it might\nseem.\n\nHoward-Synder (2009, 2014) offers a dilemma argument in defense of\nskeptical theism. On some moral theories, the facts that determine our\nall-things-considered obligations are frequently inaccessible to us.\n(Maximizing act consequentialism is one example.) Thus, given\nskeptical theism and those theories, we should frequently be in doubt\nabout our all-things-considered obligations\u2014but not in virtue of\nskeptical theism, but rather in virtue of those theories. By contrast,\non other moral theories, the facts that determine our\nall-things-considered obligations are frequently accessible to us.\nThus, given skeptical theism and those theories, we frequently should\nnot be in doubt about our all-things-considered\nobligations\u2014but not in virtue of skeptical theism, but rather in\nvirtue of those theories. Either way, skeptical theism itself\ndoesn\u2019t lead to skepticism about our all-things-considered\nobligations.\n",
