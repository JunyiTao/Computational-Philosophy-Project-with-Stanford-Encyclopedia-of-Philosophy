    "main_text": "Other Goals for and Styles of Arguing || Caring and coalescent argumentation\n2.2 Caring and coalescent argumentation\n\nThe consideration that women may have a \u201cdifferent voice\u201d\nin moral reasoning (Gilligan 1982) gave rise to care ethics as a\nfeminist alternative to traditional accounts of morality. Ayim (1988)\nsuggests that metaphors of nurturing could also replace violent ones\ndescribing arguing, especially because arguing can help to foster\ncommunity (Makau & Marty 2013). Approaches to reasoning that\npresume interest in the flourishing of other people and that consider\nthe needs of others may be common among girls and women in cultures\nthat press them into practices of motherhood and related caring labor,\nsuch as teaching, nursing, and food service.\n\nAttention to the unique audience and the speakers involved in a\nparticular discussion forces consideration of its detailed situation.\nIn one sense, this attention exhibits a bias toward certain sorts of\nevidence. That bias does not pretend to value-neutrality. Yet, Karen\nWarren argues that attention to detail provides a feminist sense of\n\u201copen-mindedness\u201d that enriches feminist reasoning with\ndata in a way that entails a type of impartiality (1988: 38).\nReasoners operate from specific locations that cannot be adequately\naddressed by an epistemology of generic or uniform knowers, as\nfeminist epistemologist Lorraine Code argues (1991). And feminist\ncommunications scholars Josina M. Makau and Debian L. Marty note that\n\u201ctaking other people\u2019s perspectives seriously is a basic\nrequirement in peaceful coexistence\u201d (2001: 11; 2013: 51).\n\nAccounting for reasoners\u2019 social situations in the way that\nWarren and Code advise provides part of the goal for Maureen\nLinker\u2019s model of \u201cintellectual empathy\u201d (2015).\nThis involves working to understand the history of social inequality\nand how it affects the reasoning and arguing of ourselves and others.\nLinker argues that\n\n\nreason and understanding must be supplemented with emotion and\nexperience so that we can know in the fullest possible sense.\n(2015: 13)\n\n\nAttention to specific personal experiences that historically have been\nignored provides a feminist standpoint with particular empirical and\nscientific value, and marks a place where the two general feminist\nepistemologies of science, feminist standpoint theory and feminist\nempiricism, coincide (Intemann 2010).\n\nThe same feminist epistemological concerns motivate Michael\nGilbert\u2019s model of \u201ccoalescent argumentation\u201d, which\ntreats arguing as communication that involves much more than a generic\nexpression of a premise-conclusion complex. In coalescent\nargumentation, the views of speakers stand in opposition to each other\nwithout the people speaking being opposed to each other.\nArguers\u2019 orientation to other people requires that they account\nfor their interconnection with those in conversation and how their\ndecisions affect others. In this collaborative model, the defeat\nneither of ideas nor of an opponent provides the goal; instead the\ngoal is to find mutual ground among people, which requires a broad\nview of relevant considerations (1994; 1997). The processes of\ncoalescent argumentation demand more information than required simply\nto find fault with others\u2019 arguments. The premise-conclusion\ncomplexes that logicians recognize as arguments become understood in\ncoalescent arguing as standing in for \u201ca\nposition-cluster of attitudes, beliefs, feelings and\nintuitions\u201d belonging to the arguer (Gilbert 1994: 96, original\nemphasis). Arguers\u2019 motivations offer a basis for interpretation\nthat provides greater room for recognizing middle ground among people\nwho seem to disagree. Exploring this common territory also suggests\nways in which alternative solutions may be developed. By emphasizing\nhow divergent positions involve agreement among the proponents\u2019\nviews and desires, points of disagreement can be distinguished from\npoints of agreement and minimized. On Gilbert\u2019s model,\n\u201cone asks not, \u2018What can I disagree with?\u2019 but,\n\u2018What must I disagree with?\u2019\u201d (1994: 109).\n\nIn light of the general feminist interest in collaborative and\ncoalescent models of argumentation, Tempest M. Henning (2018) warns\nthey may reflect certain cultural assumptions, and presumptions of\nuniversal culture. The norms recommended by what she identifies as\n\u201cnon-adversarial feminist argumentation models\u201d, and\nattributes especially to Ayim, may run contrary to the cultures and\nneeds of U.S. Black women. More generally, argumentation theory tends\nto prescribe a pleasantness of tone and directness of speech that\nconnotes respect in some cultures but not others (Henning 2021; see\n Section 2.4 on Politeness and civility).\n Some feminist philosophers also value adversarial arguing or even\nidentify personally as adversarial arguers. So, the resistance to\nforms of adversarial arguing that appears to provide a valuable\ncommonality between some feminist concerns and accepted views in\nargumentation theory may reflect only the interests of certain white\nwomen. It may actually work against the interests of other groups of\nwomen and risk reinforcing racial marginalization.\n",
