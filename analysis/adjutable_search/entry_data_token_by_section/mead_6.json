    "main_text": "Determinism and Freedom\n7. Recent Scholarship and Trends\n\nFor the better part of half a century, a resurgence of interest in\npragmatism has led to a steady production of scholarship on the\nclassical American pragmatists. Countless articles, books, and\nconferences have been dedicated to rediscovering and reinventing the\nideas of Peirce, James, and Dewey. Journals devoted to their work are\navailable in print and online. George Herbert Mead is the curious\nexception. For Mead, no eponymous journals exist. Only a handful of\nphilosophy conferences have been held in his\n honor.[4]\n In comparison to these other pragmatists, the promise of his\ncontributions remains unfulfilled.\n\nMany of the influential pragmatists of our time proudly accept the\ntitle of inheritors and stewards of the thought of Peirce, James, or\nDewey. While many sociologists have taken up Mead\u2019s banner, he\nhas not received comparable treatment in philosophical circles. Early\nreviews of Mead\u2019s posthumous publications appraised him as\ncomparable in genius and stature to Dewey and James (Shalin 2015).\nThese reviewers anticipated Mead\u2019s novel ideas would prompt much\nphilosophical debate (Shalin 2015). But philosophers who thought\nhighly of him were often disappointed. Maurice Natanson (1956, 1)\nwrote of his dissatisfaction with philosophy scholars\u2019 neglect\nof Mead, \u201cThe work of a truly major American philosopher is\ntoday largely unknown, frequently misunderstood where he is known, and\nmore often than not, simply ignored.\u201d Mead remains frequently\nglossed over, even by most scholars of pragmatism. The result has been\na deficit in philosophical Mead scholarship relative to other\nclassical pragmatists. (This, however, is not to say that there\nhasn\u2019t been important work done on Mead, for example,\nHabermas\u2019s Theory of Communicative Action is indebted\nto Mead.) In this section we will highlight promising recent\nscholarship and trends, which may open up avenues for future\nresearch.\n\nSince the posthumous publication of Mind, Self, and Society,\ncommentaries on Mead have often relied heavily on works that he did\nnot publish, with particular emphasis on those lecture notes and\nmanuscripts addressing the genesis and development of the mind and\nself. However, a systematic analysis of Mead\u2019s philosophy\nrequires an assessment of the whole of his work, including work\npublished in his lifetime (Cook 1993, xiii-xiv). A relatively recent\nmethodological trend in Mead scholarship consists of reframing\nMead\u2019s legacy from a philosopher who seldom published to one\nwhose written canon adds up to over 120 items and counting (Carreira\nda Silva 2008, 6; 2011, ix-x; Cook 2013, 95; C\u00f4t\u00e9 2015;\nReck in SW, xiii-lxii; Taylor 2019; Throop and Ward 2007). By\nutilizing writings in which Mead\u2019s authorship is uncontested,\nthese commentators seek to present Mead in a voice closer to his own.\nThis trend in research on the \u201cthe published Mead\u201d has led\nto inventive investigations into Mead\u2019s theories of experience,\nperception, action, emergence, society, the mind, and social\ncognition. Future efforts employing this method have the potential to\nhighlight Mead\u2019s contributions to the philosophies of history,\neducation, politics, and the social sciences.\n\nMead developed an interest in physiology early in his intellectual\ndevelopment, and he certainly saw us as embodied organisms, for whom\nthe sense of touch was uniquely important. But the relationship\nbetween the body and the self has been subject to different\ninterpretations. Some recent studies on Mead have sought to address\nthe constitutive role of bodily awareness in the emergence of mind and\nself, and rethink what is necessary to articulate a unified embodied\nself, given Mead\u2019s distinctions between the \u201cI\u201d and\n\u201cMe\u201d (see, for example, Cook 2013; McVeigh 2020).\nConsequently, two interrelated trajectories in contemporary Mead\nscholarship have emerged: 1) investigations into the possibility of a\npre-reflective self, particularly as it pertains to the constitution\nof a unified self, and 2) situating Mead among social cognition\ntheorists, whereby his philosophy serves as a precursor to what is now\nviewed as the second wave of cognitive science built upon\naction-oriented theories of 4EA cognition (i.e., embedded, embodied,\nenactive, extended, and affective).\n\nSeveral contemporary commentators on Mead assert that within his\ntheory of the origin and development of the self lies an opportunity\n(or a missed opportunity, depending on the degree of criticism) to\naccount for a pre-reflective bodily self-awareness in humans that\npermits a non-linguist, auto-affective, naturalized account of unified\nbodily agency, which precedes the development of the social self\n(Geniusas 2006; Madzia 2015). Madzia (2015, 82) argues that for a\nunifying self (capable of self-reflection) to emerge, we must\npresuppose body ownership, that is, a \u201cprimal\nself-awareness\u201d emanating from a body-mindedness. Similarly,\nwhile invoking Jean-Luc Marion\u2019s phenomenology, Geniusas (2006,\n258) contends that acknowledging a \u201cprimordial\nself-givenness\u201d generated by auto-affection accounts for the\n\u201cmineness of experience\u201d and aids in individuation.\nFurther, he maintains that the concept of auto-affection dissolves the\nproblem of delineating a sharp distinction between Mead\u2019s\n\u201cI\u201d and \u201cMe,\u201d because the self would be able\nto know the \u201cI\u201d directly (Geniusas 2006). These accounts\nare not meant to undermine Mead\u2019s social self but to supplement\nit as a precondition of human role-taking. Such accounts may be viewed\nas addressing the relationship between animal and human intelligence.\nMoreover, Madzia (2013; 2015, 83) argues, incorporating a\n\u201cprimal self-awareness\u201d as a stage in the genesis and\nevolution of the self affords Mead the added benefit of making his\ntheory compatible with pragmatism\u2019s principle of continuity.\nNonetheless, Mead might disagree with these approaches and respond to\nsuch commentaries by restating his commitment to the social\nconstitution of the self: \u201cI do not want to discuss metaphysical\nproblems, but I want to insist that the self has a sort of structure\nthat arises in social conduct that is entirely distinguishable from\nthis so-called subjective experience\u201d (MSS, 166).\n\nTo address Mead\u2019s apparent failure to provide a comprehensive\naccount of a unified self, some scholars have taken a different\ncourse. They have attempted to demonstrate how narrative can play a\nrole in interpreting Mead\u2019s work, for example, by providing the\nresources necessary to harmonize the multiple selves articulated by\nMead (Aboulafia 2016; Jackson 2010). A turn to narrative can be viewed\nas bringing Mead closer to the hermeneutic philosophy of Charles\nTaylor and Paul Ricoeur (see, for instance, Ezzy 1998).\n\nTaking up the second trajectory mentioned above, we find studies in\nwhat has been called the pragmatic turn in second generation cognitive\nscience (Baggio 2021). There are scholars \u2013 for example, Guido\nBaggio (2021), Roman Madzia (2016a, 2016b, 2017), and Ryan McVeigh\n(2016, 2020) \u2013 who view Mead\u2019s philosophy as a forerunner\nto more contemporary physically embodied, socially embedded,\naction-oriented theories of social cognition and\n mind.[5]\n These commentators share the belief that Mead\u2019s interconnected\ntheories of emergence, perception, action, and mind provide fertile\nareas for critical engagement with contemporary studies of enactive,\nextended, and embodied cognition.\n\nMead and second-generation cognitive theorists share a commitment to\nthe evolutionary, genetic, and ultimately social development of\ncognition. Projects in 4EA cognition have the potential to align with,\nor better, respond to Mead\u2019s demand that questions of mind and\nthe self are developed out of an integration of the\n\u201cparallel\u201d disciplines of philosophy, social psychology,\nand physiology (CP in ESP, 9\u201318; see also McVeigh 2016, 2020).\nFor instance, it has been argued that mirror neurons function as the\nneurological mechanism that allows for humans to take the attitude of\nothers (Madzia 2013; McVeigh 2016). Contemporary research in cognitive\nscience that addresses the perspectival nature and embodied sociality\nof such cognitive mechanisms as basic-level cognition and joint\nattention has the potential to complement and enrich Mead\u2019s\nviews on the emergence of self, mind, and society (McVeigh 2016;\nCahoone 2013, 2019; see also Tomasello 2020).\n\nFurther, the importance for Mead of evolutionary processes and contact\nexperience in the genesis and development of the self and mind opens\nthe door to the integration of his philosophy and cognitive science in\nsuch areas as sensorimotor enactivism (Baggio 2021) and the extended\n(Madzia 2013) and embodied mind (McVeigh 2020; Madzia 2016). Notably,\nthe primacy of the hand\u2019s role in Mead\u2019s theory of\nperception lends itself to current cognitive accounts of the embodied\nmind and the development of human intelligence and culture (Madzia\n2017).\n\nWe now transition from the philosophy of mind to the impact of\nMead\u2019s work in social and political philosophy, and its\nrelationship to Hegel. Mead\u2019s early Hegelianism has been aptly\nnoted (Cook 1993, 37\u201347; Joas 1985). Although there are scholars\nwho argue that Mead shed his Hegelian roots, others recommend that\nMead\u2019s mature work be read in light of Hegel (Aboulafia 2010).\nRecently, while continuing the methodological project of a systematic\nreading of \u201cthe published Mead,\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 (2015) presents a critical reconstruction of\nMead\u2019s concept of society by advancing a genealogical account of\nMead\u2019s lifelong engagement with Hegelian themes. Here, the\ncogenesis and indefinite co-restructuring of a self-aware society and\nselfhood, in its ontogenetic and phylogenetic manifestations,\nrepresent a marriage between Darwin\u2019s evolutionary processes and\nHegel\u2019s dialectics. C\u00f4t\u00e9 (2015) asserts that for\nMead, modern mass democracy \u2013characterized by the political\nreforms of his time and the development of what Mead calls\n\u201cinternational-mindedness\u201d \u2013 has produced a\nself-aware and self-transformative global society. C\u00f4t\u00e9\n(2015, 181) notes, however, that the promise of a cosmopolitan society\ndoes not end in mere \u201cglobalization.\u201d Indebted to the\nthought of Mead, Aboulafia\u2019s (2010) most recent book examines\nself-determination and cosmopolitanism. Among other topics, he\nexplores the ways in which the social self and a form of transcendence\nrelate to self-determination and the fashioning of a cosmopolitan\nsensibility that is sensitive to the experiences of different groups\nand peoples. Aboulafia\u2019s and C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s projects\noffer opportunities to develop a Mead-inspired political theory that\nemphasizes the transformative efforts of individuals and\ninstitutions.\n\nOver the years comparative analyses of Mead have brought him into\nconversation with analytic philosophers such as Wittgenstein, Sellars,\nQuine, and Davidson (Baggio 2016a, 2019, 2020; Madzia 2013c), the\nContinental thought of Habermas and Arendt (Aboulafia 2001),\nphenomenologists such as Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Levinas,\nand Marion (Aboulafia 1986, 2001; Geniusas 2006; Jung 1995; Rosenthal\nand Bourgeois 1991), the philosophic hermeneutics and expressivism of\nCharles Taylor (Abbott 2020; Fietz 2021), the developmental\npsychologist, linguist, and cognitive scientist Michael Tomasello\n(Cahoone 2013, 2019; McVeigh 2016; Nungesser 2016; Tomasello 2020),\neconomic thought, particularly Veblen and Sen (Baggio 2016a, 2016b,\n2017; Betz 2013; Green 2013), animal studies (Booth 2016b; Gallagher\n2016), and psychoanalytic theory (C\u00f4t\u00e9 2015; Santarelli\n2013). Research in pragmatist feminism has revealed the influence of\nMead on philosopher, educator, and activist Grace Lee Boggs\n(previously Grace Chin Lee), whose dissertation and first book\npresented an early critical introduction to Mead\u2019s social\nphilosophy (Lee 1945; Lake 2020; Varner 2021; see also Huebner 2022,\n20).\n\nOf interest, also, are those studies in philosophical hermeneutics\nplacing Mead in the tradition of Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer\n(C\u00f4t\u00e9 2021; Jung 1995; Taylor 2019). In recognizing the\nearly influence of Dilthey on Mead while a student in Berlin, we can\nbegin to see how and where their interrelated interests developed\nsimilarities and differences, particularly as they relate to the\nnatural and social sciences. Returning to their student-teacher\nrelationship serves as a springboard for contemporary philosophical\ndebates regarding the primacy of experience and life-processes, the\nsignificance of historical situatedness, and the overcoming of the\ntraditional separation of theory and praxis (Jung 1995).\n\nLastly, we arrive at Mead\u2019s philosophy of education. Before all\nelse, Mead was an educator. A \u201cstimulating\u201d orator, James\nH. Tufts tells us, for Mead, \u201cthe lecture was his medium\u201d\n(Huebner 2015, 85). He offered courses in a variety of disciplines\nthat spanned the history of thought. Prior to holding appointments at\nthe Universities of Michigan and Chicago, he tried his hand as a\ngrade-school teacher (Cook\n 1993).[6]\n For Mead, the learner does not merely receive meaning, she\nindustriously incorporates and transforms it. For this reason, he was\nactively involved in Dewey\u2019s innovative Laboratory School. For\nmany years he served as editor and contributor to the educational\njournals School Review and Elementary School\nTeacher, and publicly spoke on, and published in various other\nmediums shorter contributions to, the philosophy of education,\npedagogy, and educational psychology.\n\nIt is often argued that Mead was so consumed by his civic commitment\nto educational reform in Chicago that he spent little attention to\npublishing his ideas. Even more important, then, that it is known that\nhis longest published piece in his lifetime was A Report on\nVocational Training in Chicago and in other Cities, a 1912\ncoauthored book-length study for the City Club of Chicago comparing\npractices of vocational education across cities. In opposition to\nsegregating trade schools from traditional scholastic programs, he\nadvocated for practical vocational education as standard in the\ncurriculum of public education (Huebner 2022, 12). Further, Mead had\nintended to publish a book of collected short works, titled Essays\non Psychology (see ESP, xii). Of the 18 chapters, 10 had\neducation as their topic. Moreover, between the years 1905 and 1911,\nMead offered four courses on the philosophy of education at the\nUniversity of Chicago (PE, 3). Recognizing the vital importance of\neducation in Mead\u2019s social philosophy, Alfred Stafford Clayton\n(1943) published what remains the sole book-length investigation into\nMead\u2019s philosophy of\n education.[7]\n Not until 2008 were the lecture notes on Mead\u2019s philosophy of\neducation course made available to the public (PE, 2011). Prior to\nthis publication, only a few important studies were made on\nMead\u2019s contribution to educational theory (Barnes 2002; Biesta\n1998, 1999; Deegan 1999; Martin 2007b). Since then, little has been\nadded to this important discussion.\n\nThroughout his writings, Mead often referred to the gradual\ndevelopment of a \u201cscientific attitude\u201d in social selves\nand their society as a \u201cgreat,\u201d even \u201csplendid\nsecular adventure\u201d (MT, 63, 85; SM in SW, 265\u2013266).\nPerhaps recent trends in Mead scholarship will further clarify why he\nwas so sanguine about this secular adventure.\n",
