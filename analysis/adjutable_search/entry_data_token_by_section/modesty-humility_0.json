    "main_text": "Modesty and Humility\n1. Modesty and Humility\n\n\nThe feature of modesty and humility that has most captivated\nphilosophers is its elusive nature. It seems as though knowing that\nyou\u2019re modest somehow spoils it; the modest person, it seems,\nmust be unaware of their own modesty. Modesty can seem to be, as\nSorensen (1988) puts it, a kind of ethical blindspot: If you have it\nyou won\u2019t know it (and if you seem to know you have it, you\nprobably don\u2019t really!)\n\n\nThe fact that knowing about your own modesty seems to spoil it\nsuggests what seems, to some at least, to be a troubling tension\nbetween epistemic and moral goods. Can there really be something\nmorally good about forming biased beliefs about your own goodness? Many\nimagine that perfect moral virtue must be compatible with perfect\nknowledge. An extreme version is Plato\u2019s identification of virtue\nand knowledge in the Meno, but even less extreme views can\nfind the idea that moral virtues might require epistemic defects to be\ntroubling, or at least interesting.\n\n\nThis raises a few general issues. The first is what, if any, special\nrequirements there are regarding how we relate to ourselves. Perhaps\nforcing myself to skip lunch to finish the job is not morally different\nfrom forcing someone else to skip lunch to finish the job, but they\ncertainly feel different. This suggests that we cannot always relate to\nourselves in the same way as we relate to others.\n\n\nThese issues are related to debates about what makes modesty or\nhumility morally virtuous at all. Debates about modesty and humility\nare often battles in larger wars about the nature of virtue more\ngenerally.\n",
