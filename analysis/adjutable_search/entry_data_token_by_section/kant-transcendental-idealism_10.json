    "main_text": "Kant as a Phenomenalist || Qualified phenomenalism\n3.2 Qualified phenomenalism\n\nKant repeatedly claims that our representations alone do not ground\nthe existence of their objects. At A92/B125 he writes that\n\u201crepresentation in itself does not produce its objects in so far\nas existence is concerned\u201d and in a 1792 letter to J.S. Beck he\ndismissed the Feder-Garve interpretation with one line: \n\n\nI speak of ideality in respect of the form of representation,\nwhile they construe it as ideality in respect of the matter,\ni.e., ideality of the object and its existence. (Ak. 11:395)\n\n\nThe first passage could be taken to mean that the existence of\nempirical objects is not wholly grounded in the contents of\nour experience; something else must be added. The second passage could\nbe taken to mean that Feder and Garve misattributed to him the\nopposite view: that all there is to the existence of an object in\nspace is our having mental states with a certain content. But all this\nshows is that strong phenomenalism is not Kant\u2019s view.\nIt leaves open the possibility that he accepts qualified\nphenomenalism: the existence of objects in space is grounded\npartially, and their core physical properties are grounded wholly, in\nthe contents of our representations of them.\n\nThe first question to be answered is, what, in addition to the\ncontents of our representations, grounds the existence of empirical\nobjects? The natural answer, for the qualified phenomenalist, is that\nthere must be things in themselves that appear as these objects. Kant\nrepeatedly insists that it is a conceptual truth that appearances are\nappearances of something that is not itself an appearance, a thing in\nitself (e.g., A251\u20132, Bxxvi\u2013xxvii, B306, B307, and Ak.\n4:314\u20135). On the qualified phenomenalist reading, this means\nthat the existence of an appearance requires (a) a representation of\nan object, and (b) a thing in itself that appears as that object. A\nfully developed qualified phenomenalist reading would require saying\nprecisely what it means for a thing in itself to appear as an\nempirical object (an object of experience), but for reasons of space\nonly a sketch of an answer can be given here. At the minimum, the\nqualified phenomenalist should require that the thing in itself\ncausally affect the experiencing subject, and that the sensory content\nthus produced be involved in the experience of the object. Some\nscholars have suggested that the properties of appearances are\nstructurally isomorphic to the properties of things in themselves, but\nthat idea will not be further pursued here (e.g., Findlay 1981:\n92\u201393; see also Van Cleve 1999: 155\u2013162).\n\nThe qualified phenomenalist also owes us an answer to the question,\nwhich are the representations whose content partly grounds the\nexistence of empirical objects and wholly grounds their core physical\nproperties? The natural answer is \u201cexperience\u201d, so the\nqualified phenomenalist owes us an interpretation of what Kant means\nby \u201cexperience\u201d, what its content is, and how it grounds\n(partly) the existence and (wholly) empirical properties of\n appearances.[27]\n We have already seen that, for familiar reasons, Kant cannot ground\nthe existence of empirical objects in our mere perceptions of them:\nsometimes we misperceive objects, objects exist while unperceived, and\nthere are objects we cannot ever directly perceive.\n\nThere have been few worked-out phenomenalist interpretations of Kant\nin the secondary literature. An outline of one such reading is\npresented in what follows in order to present the reader with some\nmore determinate idea of what a qualified phenomenalist reading might\nlook like and why\n (section 3.3)\n some of the classic objections to phenomenalist interpretations may\nbe less devastating than they are sometimes presented. But this is not\nmeant to give the impression that this is the only plausible\nphenomenalist reading of Kant.\n\nThe qualified phenomenalist grounds the existence of objects (partly)\nand their core physical properties (wholly) in the content of\nexperience. But this requires a conception of experience on which it\nis not identical to any individual subject\u2019s perceptual\nepisodes; otherwise, objects will have contradictory properties if,\nfor instance, I see the tower as round and you see it as square. Kant\ndistinguishes experience from perception in the A\n\u201cDeduction\u201d, writing:\n\n\nThere is only one experience, in which all\nperceptions are represented as in thoroughgoing and lawlike connection\n[\u2026] If one speaks of different experiences, they are only so\nmany perceptions insofar as they belong to one and the same universal\nexperience. (A110).\n\n\nIn this sense of experience (\u201cuniversal experience\u201d) there\nis only one experience. It may also be that, inter-subjectively, there\nis only one universal experience as well: my perceptions and your\nperceptions are only \u201cexperiences\u201d to the extent that they\ncohere with the one universal experience. Kant, in this passage, does\nnot tell us much about what universal experience is, or what its\ncontents are. He does tell us that it is composed from perceptions,\nthat it has an a priori form (space, time, and categories),\nand that the perceptions that constitute it are in\n\u201cthoroughgoing and lawlike connection\u201d.\n\nElsewhere, he sheds further light on the coherence relation that\ndefines universal experience:\n\n\nIn space and time, however, the empirical truth of appearances is\nsatisfactorily secured, and sufficiently distinguished from its\nkinship with dreams, if both are correctly and thoroughly connected up\naccording to empirical laws in one experience. Accordingly, the\nobjects of experience are never given in themselves, but only in\nexperience, and they do not exist at all outside it. (A493/B521)\n\n\nPerception Pn coheres with perceptions\nP1 through Pn\u22121\nto the extent that the causal laws observed in P1\nthrough Pn\u22121 are observed in\nPn. This gives us reason to exclude\nhallucinatory perceptions from universal experience: hallucinatory\nperceptions involve apparent violations of the causal laws that are\nobserved to hold in our \u201cwaking\u201d perceptions, so they do\nnot cohere with those other perceptions.\n\nWe know a priori something very general about the form of\nuniversal experience, of course: it will be spatiotemporal and the\nprinciples of experience (applications of the categories) will hold in\nit. But that does not determine the determinate a posteriori\ncontent of universal experience, and the idea of a qualified\nphenomenalist analysis of empirical objects is to hold that their\nexistence and empirical properties are (partly and wholly,\nrespectively) grounded in that fully determinate a posteriori\ncontent. So we might begin with the following analysis:\n\n(Experience) Universal experience consists in the largest\ninternally coherent subset of perceptions that obeys the principles of\nexperience. A subset of perceptions is internally coherent to the\ndegree to which causal regularities hold among its contents.\n\nOn a qualified phenomenalist reading of Kant, this might be taken as\nthe set of representations whose content grounds objects. However,\nthere are at least two problems with this analysis of universal\nexperience:\n\n(i)\n Unperceived objects. Kant holds that there are\nspatiotemporal objects we cannot perceive. This by itself would pose a\nproblem for the proposed definition of universal experience, since, on\nthe qualified phenomenalist view, that definition entails that there\ncannot be unperceived spatiotemporal objects. But Kant further claims\nthat we can experience unperceivable objects through\nperceiving their effects and inferring their existence from causal\nlaws. So the definition of universal experience needs to be refined\n(A226/B273; Langton (1998: 186\u2013190).\n (ii) \n Secondary qualities. As we discussed above in the\nsection on Kant\u2019s empirical realism, Kant distinguishes between\nthe properties spatiotemporal objects actually have \u201cin\nthemselves\u201d and those they merely appear to have in sense\nperception. He has a basically Lockean distinction between primary and\nsecondary qualities at the empirical level. Since we perceive objects\nas having secondary qualities, the definition of universal experience\ngiven above, combined with the qualified phenomenalist analysis,\nentails that empirical objects have secondary qualities. We need to\nfurther refine our definition of universal experience to eliminate\nsecondary qualities from the empirical properties of objects.\n\n\nWe need to refine the conception of experience so as to include\nunperceived objects and exclude secondary qualities. This might push\nus towards a more \u201cscientistic\u201d conception of universal\nexperience, on which experience is something like the ideal scientific\ntheory of objects in space and\n time.[28]\n The form of that theory is a priori determinable from the\nforms of experience: it will represent persisting substances in a 3-D\nEuclidean space obeying universal causal laws and in simultaneous\nmutual interaction. However, the determinate a posteriori\ncontent of that theory will be grounded in the perceptions subjects\nactually have.\n\nHere is a sketch of a conception of universal experience that the\nqualified phenomenalist might accept:\n\n(Experience) Universal experience is the maximally unified\nand lawful representation of objects in space and time that is\ncompatible with the a priori forms of experience and\njustified by the totality of subjects\u2019 perceptual states, or the\nconjunction of such representations if there is no unique such\n representation.[29]\n\nTo fully develop such a view, a lot more would have to be said about\nexactly how the content of experience is grounded in, and justified\nby, the contents of subjects\u2019 perceptual states, but this gloss\nis enough to give us a sense of what a developed phenomenalist reading\nof Kant might look like.\n",
