    "main_text": "Methodology\n3. Methodology\n\nIn Kosmos, Humboldt refers to Schelling\u2019s dynamic\naccount of nature\u2014of nature not as a set of finished and fixed\nproducts, but as productivity\u2014as an inspiration for his own\nwork. \u201cTo the enthusiastic researcher\u201d, Humboldt writes\nciting Schelling, nature appears as \u201cthe holy primordial power\n[Urkraft] of the world, which brings forth all things from\nitself\u2026\u201d (Kosmos 1: 25; CO 1: 55; see also\nKosmos 1: 38). This reiterates earlier expressions of\nenthusiasm toward Schelling\u2019s Naturphilosophie (Werner\n2000; Pinsdorf 2020). In a letter from January 1805, Humboldt\ndescribes Schelling\u2019s Naturphilosophie as having\nbrought about \u201ca revolution\u201d in the empirical\nsciences\u2014a revolution which, Humboldt continues, has ushered in\n\u201cone of the most beautiful periods in these crazy times\u201d\n(Fuhrmans 1975: 180). A year later, in the introduction to Ideen\nzu einer Geographie der Pflanzen, Humboldt writes, \n\n\nI am not wholly unfamiliar with Schelling\u2019s system, and far from\nthe view that the true nature-philosophical system can be destructive\nfor the advance of empirical science. (DA 1: 45)\n\n\nThese statements can be regarded as an indication of Humboldt\u2019s\nopenness to certain forms of idealism (Pinsdorf 2020). But Humboldt\nwas also clear that his own methodology differed from that of the\nidealists\u2014whether Schelling, Hegel, or Kant\u2014in that he did\nnot seek to \u201cconstruct\u201d nature on the basis of an a priori\nprinciple. As he elaborates in the Introduction to Kosmos,\nhis is not a \u201crational science of nature\u201d, which aims to\n\u201cderive\u201d nature from \u201ca few rational\nprinciples\u201d. And in a letter to his friend Varnhagen, Humboldt\ncomplains about speculative philosophies of nature, writing that it is\nlike \u201ca chemistry, in which one cannot wet his hands\u201d\n(BVE: 90).\n\nHumboldt, however, also distinguishes his methodology from what he\ncalls \u201ca raw and incomplete empiricism\u201d. While the\nidealist position remains one-sidedly abstract and empirically\ndeficient, the empiricist position, he maintains, fails to deliver any\ninsight, or discern necessity (Kosmos 1: 13; CO 1: 38). In\ncontrast to both, Humboldt describes his approach as a \u201cthinking\nobservation [denkende Betrachtung]\u201d, which involves\n\n\n\na meaningful ordering [sinnvolle Anordnung]of the appearances\nof nature \u2026 [that is] deeply penetrated with the belief in an\nancient internal necessity [eine alte innere Notwendigkeit]\n\u2026. (Kosmos 1: 22; CO 1: 50)\n\n\nHumboldt\u2019s methodology bears a clear affinity to the approach\nthat Schiller dubbed \u201crational empiricism\u201d and which he\nidentified with Goethe\u2019s methodology. In fact, in E. C.\nOtt\u00e9\u2019s English translation of Kosmos,\nHumboldt\u2019s approach is described as a form of \u201crational\nempiricism\u201d (CO 1, 39). Furthermore, scholars have noted,\nHumboldt\u2019s notion of \u201cthinking observation\u201d echoes\nGoethe\u2019s idea of \u201cintuitive judgment\u201d and his\n\u201cgentle empiricism [zarte Empirie]\u201d (B\u00f6hme\n2016; Mill\u00e1n 2011; Nassar 2022). Indeed, Humboldt himself\nacknowledged his deep debt to Goethe\u2019s methodology, in a letter\nto Caroline von Wolzogen from May 1806. It was Goethe\u2019s\n\u201cviews of nature [Ansichten der Natur]\u201d, he\nrelates to Wolzogen, that transformed his own approach and most\ninfluenced his observations in South America. By working alongside\nGoethe, Humboldt continues, he was \u201cgranted new organs [mit\nneuen Organen ausger\u00fcstet]\u201d of perception, through\nwhich he was able to discern relations and connections between the\nmost varied living and non-living beings (AML: 180).\n\nLike Goethe, Humboldt\u2019s form of empiricism aims to grasp the\nphenomenon and, as Goethe puts it, \u201cremain\u201d with it. This\nmeans resisting the move to abstraction, and locating\nnecessity\u2014meaning, order\u2014in the phenomenon itself. It also\nmeans, as Goethe explains, that the knower must become \u201cflexible\nand plastic\u201d like the natural phenomena (MA 12: 13).\n\nTo achieve these ends, Goethe developed the notion of\nmetamorphosis\u2014which aims to describe the transforming forms of\nliving beings, and discern how these forms are meaningfully (rather\nthan contingently or randomly) related to one another. In\nKosmos Humboldt maintains that Goethe\u2019s greatest\ncontribution to science amounts to the \u201csolution\u201d he\noffered to the \u201cproblem of metamorphosis\u201d. This solution,\nhe continues, is nothing other than the notion of \u201can ideal form\nthat corresponds to certain fundamental types [auf gewisse\nGrundtypen entspricht]\u201d (Kosmos 1: 22; CO 1:\n41).\n\nAs Humboldt explains in the remarks preceding his mention of Goethe,\nthe \u201cproblem of metamorphosis\u201d has to do with the dual\ndifficulties of the proliferation of organic forms (the infinite\ndiversity of nature) and the relation between the currently existing\norganic forms and those long extinct. These two difficulties map onto\nthe ancient problem of the one and the many\u2014of discerning unity,\nrelation, connection, in diversity. It is a problem that many had\ntried to resolve. But, according to Humboldt, it was Goethe and his\nnotion of metamorphosis that offered a solution.\n\nFor Goethe, the study of metamorphosis involves discerning how the\nparts that make up a living being (e.g., a plant) transform in\nrelation to one another and their larger context (the plant, and also\ntheir surrounding). This involves a focus on form\u2014on\nthe leaf form, for instance\u2014and seeing how this form\nreappears differently at various stages of the plant\u2019s\ndevelopment (e.g., how the leaf form is reiterated in the petal, or\nhow the congregating tendency of the cotyledons reappears in the calyx\nand again in the corolla). This allows the observer to discern unity\n(continuity, relation) in and through the transforming forms.\n\n\nWhile for Goethe metamorphosis primarily (though not exclusively)\ndescribes the relations between the various parts of a living being\n(e.g., the parts of a plant), for Humboldt the concept was extended to\ndescribe the ways in which the same \u201cfundamental forms\n[Urformen]\u201d reappear across the earth (DA 1: 53; EGP:\n67; translation altered). Like Herder before him, Humboldt\u2019s aim\nwas not simply to discern necessity in the structure of individual\nbeings, but also in the relations between beings\u2014and\nbetween beings and their contexts.\n\nHumboldt introduces the idea of a \u201cphysiognomy of nature\u201d\nto explicate his approach. Just as we discern a person\u2019s\ncharacter through their gestures, body language and expressions, so\nthe physiognomist of nature discerns the character of a\nlandscape through the expressions and gestures of plant and\nanimal life. Thus, the physiognomist of plants focuses on the\n\u201cform\u201d of the plant\u2014those aspect of a plant that\nmake the greatest impression on the viewer: whether it attains to\ngreat heights (like palms) or twists and turns (like lianas), whether\nits leaves are broad like those of the banana tree or narrow like\nconifer needles. The emphasis is on visibility and expressiveness,\nwith the goal of discerning reappearing forms across regions\nand in different contexts. By studying the Urformen of\nplants, and discerning how they reappear across regions, Humboldt\nelaborates, we begin to develop a physiognomy of nature\u2014that is,\nan understanding of the environments, in which the plants grow. In\nthis way, we begin to grasp where and when plants appear, how they\ninfluence their contexts and how their context influences them. This,\nHumboldt contends, is the goal of the student of nature\u2014and\nforms the foundations of the geography of plants and bio-geography more\ngenerally.\n\nThe emphasis on visibility, expressiveness, and remaining with the\nempirical phenomenon in order to discern meaning and necessity\ntherein, clearly underpins Humboldt\u2019s philosophy of nature. But\nit also underpins his philosophy of culture, widely construed.\n",
