    "main_text": "Karma and Rebirth\n4. Karma and Rebirth\n\nIt is not just classical Indian self-theorists who have found this\nobjection persuasive. Some Buddhists have as well. Among these\nBuddhists, however, this has led to the rejection not of non-self but\nof rebirth. (Historically this response was not unknown among East\nAsian Buddhists, and it is not rare among Western Buddhists today.)\nThe evidence that the Buddha himself accepted rebirth and karma seems\nquite strong, however. The later tradition would distinguish between\ntwo types of discourse in the body of the Buddha\u2019s teachings:\nthose intended for an audience of householders seeking instruction\nfrom a sage, and those intended for an audience of monastic\nrenunciates already versed in his teachings. And it would be one thing\nif his use of the concepts of karma and rebirth were limited to the\nformer. For then such appeals could be explained away as another\ninstance of the Buddha\u2019s pedagogical skill (commonly referred to\nas up\u0101ya). The idea would be that householders who fail\nto comply with the most basic demands of morality are not likely (for\nreasons to be discussed shortly) to make significant progress toward\nthe cessation of suffering, and the teaching of karma and rebirth,\neven if not strictly speaking true, does give those who accept it a\n(prudential) reason to be moral. But this sort of \u2018noble\nlie\u2019 justification for the Buddha teaching a doctrine he does\nnot accept fails in the face of the evidence that he also taught it to\nquite advanced monastics (e.g., A III.33). And what he taught is not\nthe version of karma popular in certain circles today, according to\nwhich, for instance, an act done out of hatred makes the agent\nsomewhat more disposed to perform similar actions out of similar\nmotives in the future, which in turn makes negative experiences more\nlikely for the agent. What the Buddha teaches is instead the far\nstricter view that each action has its own specific consequence for\nthe agent, the hedonic nature of which is determined in accordance\nwith causal laws and in such a way as to require rebirth as long as\naction continues. So if there is a conflict between the doctrine of\nnon-self and the teaching of karma and rebirth, it is not to be\nresolved by weakening the Buddha\u2019s commitment to the latter.\n\nThe Sanskrit term karma literally means \u2018action\u2019.\nWhat is nowadays referred to somewhat loosely as the theory of karma\nis, speaking more strictly, the view that there is a causal\nrelationship between action (karma) and \u2018fruit\u2019\n(phala), the latter being an experience of pleasure, pain or\nindifference for the agent of the action. This is the view that the\nBuddha appears to have accepted in its most straightforward form.\nActions are said to be of three types: bodily, verbal and mental. The\nBuddha insists, however, that by action is meant not the movement or\nchange involved, but rather the volition or intention that brought\nabout the change. As Gombrich (2009) points out, the Buddha\u2019s\ninsistence on this point reflects the transition from an earlier\nritualistic view of action to a view that brings action within the\npurview of ethics. For it is when actions are seen as subject to moral\nassessment that intention becomes relevant. One does not, for\ninstance, perform the morally blameworthy action of speaking\ninsultingly to an elder just by making sounds that approximate to the\npronunciation of profanities in the presence of an elder; parrots and\nprelinguistic children can do as much. What matters for moral\nassessment is the mental state (if any) that produced the bodily,\nverbal or mental change. And it is the occurrence of these mental\nstates that is said to cause the subsequent occurrence of hedonically\ngood, bad and neutral experiences. More specifically, it is the\noccurrence of the three \u2018defiled\u2019 mental states that\nbrings about karmic fruit. The three defilements\n(kle\u015bas) are desire, aversion and ignorance. And we are\ntold quite specifically (A III.33) that actions performed by an agent\nin whom these three defilements have been destroyed do not have karmic\nconsequences; such an agent is experiencing their last birth.\n\nSome caution is required in understanding this claim about the\ndefilements. The Buddha seems to be saying that it is possible to act\nnot only without ignorance, but also in the absence of desire or\naversion, yet it is difficult to see how there could be intentional\naction without some positive or negative motivation. To see\none\u2019s way around this difficulty, one must realize that by\n\u2018desire\u2019 and \u2018aversion\u2019 are meant those\npositive and negative motives respectively that are colored by\nignorance, viz. ignorance concerning suffering, impermanence and\nnon-self. Presumably the enlightened person, while knowing the truth\nabout these matters, can still engage in motivated action. Their\nactions are not based on the presupposition that there is an\n\u2018I\u2019 for which those actions can have significance.\nIgnorance concerning these matters perpetuates rebirth, and thus\nfurther occasions for existential suffering, by facilitating a\nmotivational structure that reinforces one\u2019s ignorance. We can\nnow see how compliance with common-sense morality could be seen as an\ninitial step on the path to the cessation of suffering. While the\npresence of ignorance makes all action\u2014even that deemed morally\ngood\u2014karmically potent, those actions commonly considered\nmorally evil are especially powerful reinforcers of ignorance, in that\nthey stem from the assumption that the agent\u2019s welfare is of\nparamount importance. While recognition of the moral value of others\nmay still involve the conceit that there is an \u2018I\u2019, it can\nnonetheless constitute progress toward dissolution of the sense of\nself.\n\nThis excursus into what the Buddha meant by karma may help us see how\nhis middle path strategy could be used to reply to the objection to\nnon-self from rebirth. That objection was that the reward and\npunishment generated by karma across lives could never be deserved in\nthe absence of a transmigrating self. The middle path strategy\ngenerally involves locating and rejecting an assumption shared by a\npair of extreme views. In this case the views will be (1) that the\nperson in the later life deserves the fruit generated by the action in\nthe earlier life, and (2) that this person does not deserve the fruit.\nOne assumption shared by (1) and (2) is that persons deserve reward\nand punishment depending on the moral character of their actions, and\none might deny this assumption. But that would be tantamount to moral\nnihilism, and a middle path is said to avoid nihilisms (such as\nannihilationism). A more promising alternative might be to deny that\nthere are ultimately such things as persons that could bear moral\nproperties like desert. This is what the Buddha seems to mean when he\nasserts that the earlier and the later person are neither the same nor\ndifferent (S II.62; S II.76; S II.113). Since any two existing things\nmust be either identical or distinct, to say of the two persons that\nthey are neither is to say that strictly speaking they do not\nexist.\n\nThis alternative is more promising because it avoids moral nihilism.\nFor it allows one to assert that persons and their moral properties\nare conventionally real. To say this is to say that given our\ninterests and cognitive limitations, we do better at achieving our\naim\u2014minimizing overall pain and suffering\u2014by acting as\nthough there are persons with morally significant properties.\nUltimately there are just impersonal entities and events in causal\nsequence: ignorance, the sorts of desires that ignorance facilitates,\nan intention formed on the basis of such a desire, a bodily, verbal or\nmental action, a feeling of pleasure, pain or indifference, and an\noccasion of suffering. The claim is that this situation is usefully\nthought of as, for instance, a person who performs an evil deed due to\ntheir ignorance of the true nature of things, receives the unpleasant\nfruit they deserve in the next life, and suffers through their\ncontinuing on the wheel of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. It is useful to think\nof the situation in this way because it helps us locate the\nappropriate places to intervene to prevent future pain (the evil deed)\nand future suffering (ignorance).\n\nIt is no doubt quite difficult to believe that karma and rebirth exist\nin the form that the Buddha claims. It is said that their existence\ncan be confirmed by those who have developed the power of\nretrocognition through advanced yogic technique. But this is of little\nhelp to those not already convinced that meditation is a reliable\nmeans of knowledge. What can be said with some assurance is that karma\nand rebirth are not inconsistent with non-self. Rebirth without\ntransmigration is logically possible.\n",
