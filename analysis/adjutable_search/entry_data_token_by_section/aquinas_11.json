    "main_text": "Ethics || Happiness\n8.1 Happiness\n\nAquinas\u2019s worldview is thoroughly teleological, inasmuch as he\nholds \u201cit is necessary that all agents act for the sake of an\nend\u201d (ST 1a2ae 1.2c). There is a distinction to be\ndrawn, however, between those agents that are unable to understand\ntheir end and rational agents, who \u201cmove themselves to their end\nbecause they have control over their acts through free choice\u201d\n(ibid.). It is for rational agents that ethical questions arise.\nAquinas follows Aristotle in supposing that human choices must be\nordered toward a single ultimate end: \u201cthere must be some\nultimate end on account of which all other things are desired, whereas\nthis end itself is not desired on account of anything else\u201d\n(Comm. Nic. Ethics I.1.22). This ultimate end, whatever it\nis, can be referred to as happiness (beatitudo). In the\nTreatise on Happiness from the start of ST 1a2ae, after\nworking through various predictably unsatisfactory candidates for our\nultimate end\u2014not riches, not honor, not pleasure, and so\non\u2014Aquinas arrives at the view that happiness consists primarily\nin intellectual contemplation. And since the highest truth and the\ngreatest good are of course God, our ultimate happiness must lie\nthere: \u201cfinal and complete happiness can consist in nothing\nother than the vision of the divine essence\u201d (ST 1a2ae\n3.8c). Human beings possess this most fully in the life to come (Brown\n2021), but even in this life Aquinas\u2019s conception of happiness\nis strongly intellectualist: \u201cit is clear that people who give\nthemselves to the contemplation of truth are the happiest a person in\nthis life can be\u201d (Comm. Nic. Ethics X.12.2110).\n\nThis eudaimonistic framework\u2014to use the Greek term for ethical\ntheories aimed at happiness\u2014shapes all of Aquinas\u2019s\nethical thinking. It is perhaps the most striking instance of his\nconfidence in Aristotelianism as the proper philosophical foundation\nfor a Christian worldview. Predictably, that confidence was met with\nvarious sorts of challenges. One concerns his insistence that our\nultimate end is intellectual rather than volitional. For many\nsubsequent theorists, Christian and secular, the ultimate end of human\nlife should not be intellectual contemplation but instead should be\nlove. Aquinas agrees\u2014indeed, he stresses\u2014that love is an\nessential complement to happiness, pulling us toward our end and\nrejoicing in its grasp. Still, the goal of life properly speaking is\nto understand God and God\u2019s creation (ST 1a2ae 3.4).\n(For nuanced discussions see Stenberg 2016a and Stump 2022.)\n\nA second concern, which troubles eudaimonism in all of its forms, is\nthat Aquinas rests the foundations of ethics on a self-directed\nconcern for our own happiness. That is liable to look like a doubtful\nstrategy for any ethical theory, and particularly for\nJudeo\u2013Christian ethics given its radically altruistic\norientation, as epitomized in the twin injunctions to \u201cLove the\nLord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all\nyour mind\u201d and to \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d\n(Matthew 22:37\u201339, quoting Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18).\nOn its face, the eudaimonistic approach might seem to conflict\ndirectly with these injunctions, given the way that it grounds all\nhuman agency in our ultimate pursuit of happiness:\n\nThe will naturally tends towards its ultimate end: for every human\nbeing naturally wills happiness. And this natural willing is the cause\nof all other willings, since whatever a human being wills, he wills\nfor the sake of an end. (ST 1a 60.2c)\n\n\nAquinas is unflinching in his insistence that our final end is our own\nhappiness. But it has to be remembered that \u2018happiness\u2019 is\njust a generic label for the human activity that is ultimately best\nfor us. And what is ultimately best for us is not the selfish pursuit\nof our own wellbeing, which is surely an ambition that would make\nanyone miserable. What we should seek, as we have seen already, is an\nunderstanding of the world and its Creator. This, again speaking\nteleologically, is what we were created to do. By pursuing this\nsubstantive goal, and actualizing our intellectual capacities to the\nutmost, we make ourselves as good as we can be, and we contribute to\nthe universe as a whole\u2019s being as good as it can be. How does\nsuch intellectual activity ground a theory of ethics? It does so\nbecause when we understand God and the created order, we understand\nwhy we should love God preeminently and why we should love our\nneighbor. But to see how these ideas get developed, we need to turn to\nhis theory of the moral law. (For general discussions of\nAquinas\u2019s eudaimonistic framework see MacDonald 1991b; Bradley\n1997; Kenny 1998; Osborne 2005; Stenberg 2016b.)\n",
