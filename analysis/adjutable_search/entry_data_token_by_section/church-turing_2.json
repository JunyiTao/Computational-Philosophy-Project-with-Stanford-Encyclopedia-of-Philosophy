    "main_text": "The 1936 Thesis and its Context || Making the informal concept of an effective method precise\n1.2 Making the informal concept of an effective method precise\n\nThe notion of an effective method or procedure is an informal one, and\nattempts to characterize effectiveness, such as the above, lack rigor,\nfor the key requirement that the method must demand no insight,\nintuition or ingenuity is left unexplicated.\n\nOne of Alan Turing\u2019s achievements, in his famous paper of 1936,\nwas to present a formally exact predicate with which the informal\npredicate \u201ccan be done by means of an effective method\u201d\nmay be replaced (Turing 1936). Alonzo Church, working independently,\ndid the same (Church 1936a).\n\nThe replacement predicates that Church and Turing proposed were, on\nthe face of it, very different from one another. However, these\npredicates turned out to be equivalent, in the sense that\neach picks out the same set (call it \\(S\\)) of mathematical functions.\nThe Church-Turing thesis is the assertion that this set \\(S\\) contains\nevery function whose values can be obtained by a method or\nprocedure satisfying the above conditions for effectiveness.\n\nSince it can also be shown that there are no functions in \\(S\\)\nother than ones whose values can be obtained by a method\nsatisfying the above conditions for effectiveness, the Church-Turing\nthesis licenses replacing the informal claim \u201cThere is an\neffective method for obtaining the values of function \\(f\\)\u201d by\nthe formal claim \u201c\\(f\\) is a member of \\(S\\)\u201d\u2014or by\nany other formal claim equivalent to this one.\n\nWhen the Church-Turing thesis is expressed in terms of the replacement\nconcept proposed by Turing, it is appropriate to refer to the thesis\nalso as \u201cTuring\u2019s thesis\u201d; and as\n\u201cChurch\u2019s thesis\u201d when expressed in terms of one or\nanother of the formal replacements proposed by Church.\n\nThe formal concept proposed by Turing was that of computability by\nTuring machine. He argued for the claim\u2014Turing\u2019s\nthesis\u2014that whenever there is an effective method for obtaining\nthe values of a mathematical function, the function can be computed by\na Turing machine.\n\nThe converse claim\u2014amounting to the claim mentioned above, that\nthere are no functions in \\(S\\) other than ones whose values\ncan be obtained by an effective method\u2014is easily established,\nsince a Turing machine program is itself a specification of an\neffective method. Without exercising any insight, intuition, or\ningenuity, a human being can work through the instructions in the\nprogram and carry out the required operations.\n\nIf Turing\u2019s thesis is correct, then talk about the existence and\nnon-existence of effective methods and procedures can be replaced\nthroughout mathematics, logic and computer science by talk about the\nexistence or non-existence of Turing machine programs.\n\nTuring stated his thesis in numerous places, with varying degrees of\nrigor. The following formulation is one of the most accessible:\n\n\nTuring\u2019s thesis:\n\nL.C.M.s [logical computing machines: Turing\u2019s expression for\nTuring machines] can do anything that could be described as\n\u201crule of thumb\u201d or \u201cpurely mechanical\u201d.\n(Turing 1948 [2004: 414])\n\n\nHe adds:\n\n\nThis is sufficiently well established that it is now agreed amongst\nlogicians that \u201ccalculable by means of an L.C.M.\u201d is the\ncorrect accurate rendering of such phrases. (Ibid.)\n\n",
