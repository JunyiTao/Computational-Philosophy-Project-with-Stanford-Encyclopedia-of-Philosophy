    "main_text": "Continental Feminism and Post- and Decolonial Thought\n3. Continental Feminism and Post- and Decolonial Thought\n\nContinental feminist approaches to questions on colonialism revolve\naround two main sets of investigations: on the one hand, the\ninterrogation of the hegemony of the West as an abstract category that\nis deployed strategically to exclude and inferiorize communities\ndeemed Non-Western (Spivak 1999; Narayan 1997; Mohanty 1984), and on\nthe other hand, the question of coloniality, which focuses on the\npolitical and epistemic ordering of the globe starting with the\ncolonization of the Americas (Lugones 2003; Wynter 1995; Ortega 2016).\nTo this end, these approaches both use schemas of the Continental\ntradition (such as phenomenology, psychoanalysis, genealogy,\ndeconstruction, and poststructuralism) and call into question the\ngeographic and racial assumptions that underlie Continental\nphilosophy. For both of these approaches, an analysis of colonialism\nis inseparable from the political aim of challenging and undoing the\ncolonial world. This challenge entails deconstructing the categories\nof the colonially determined globe (such as East-West,\nWestern-Non-Western, Developed-Underdeveloped, First World-Third\nWorld, North-South) through focusing on the concrete lived experiences\nof individuals and communities. This section focuses on the general\ncharacteristics of these two Continental feminist approaches taken up\nunder the rough categories of postcolonial and decolonial feminisms,\nwith the former focusing on the Western-Non-western divide that marks\ncolonial relations, and the latter on the North-South dialogues that\nemerge within the relations of coloniality. It concludes by\nhighlighting coalitional thinking, a fundamental aspect of both post-\nand decolonial feminist approaches.\n\nPostcolonial feminist approaches maintain that in order to interrogate\nthe hegemony of the West, it is necessary to deconstruct the ways in\nwhich it is deployed to exclude the non-Western subject. Furthermore,\nsuch deployment is always a strategic one, insofar as the\n\u201cWest\u201d is not a concrete geographical category, and the\nparadigm of Western subjectivity is continuously built by demarcating\nthose who do not fit in it. Postcolonial feminisms are\ninterdisciplinary and not limited to the field of philosophy, and they\nchallenge the inscription of the gender, racial, and geographic\ncategories that underlie the hegemony of the Western subject. In doing\nso, Continental feminist approaches engage with figures from\npoststructuralism and critical theory (such as Foucault, Derrida,\nDeleuze and Adorno), and they deploy methods such as genealogy and\ndeconstruction (Spivak 1988; Mohanty 1984), in order to question the\nunderlying geographic and gendered assumptions of these methods. In\n\u201cCan the Subaltern Speak?\u201d for example, Gayatri\nChakravorty Spivak engages with French poststructuralism and questions\nthe paradigms of speech/reason that deny the very possibility of\ncapacities such as resistance for those that do not fit within the\ngeographic, racialized, and gendered boundaries of Western\nSubjectivity (Spivak 1988). In doing so, she highlights the ways in\nwhich poststructuralism relies upon the very categories (of speech,\nreason, or universal subjectivity) that it ostensibly critiques.\n\nThe tension highlighted by Spivak, in which the Western Subject\nconstitutes both the dominant subject and the only subject capable of\nresistance, underlies postcolonial feminisms\u2019 critique of the\nalignment of the West with modernity and progress (McClintock 1995;\nStoler 1995). Chandra Talpade Mohanty, in \u201cUnder Western\nEyes\u201d, criticizes the hegemony of Western approaches in defining\nthe scope and goals of feminist struggles. Issues such as the veil\ndebate, in this sense, point to the political and phenomenological\nracialization of the Non-Western woman (Al-Saji 2010; Sheth 2006). At\nthe same time, Uma Narayan draws attention to the risks of fetishizing\nthe category of the Non-Western and highlights how such a\nfetishization remains within colonially determined divisions (Narayan\n1997; Narayan & Harding 2000). Namita Goswami, in Subjects\nThat Matter, develops heterogeneity as a kind of conceptual\ncontinuity between feminism, philosophy, and postcolonial studies,\nwhich allows for an understanding of difference beyond oppositional\nand antagonistic terms (Goswami 2019).\n\nDecolonial feminisms emerge primarily from the U.S. Latina and Latinx\ncontexts and have a different genealogy, insofar as they are in\ndialogue with Latin American Philosophy, Continental Philosophy,\nAnglo-American Thought, and especially U.S. Women of Color feminisms.\nFocusing on North-South dialogues, Latin American and Latina Feminist\nphilosophers such as Ofelia Schutte engage with the work of figures\nsuch as Nietzsche, Kristeva, and Irigaray while developing Latin\nAmerican philosophy as a field in U.S. academic philosophy (Schutte\n1984; 1993; for more, see the entry on\n Latin American feminism).\n Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff, for example, brings Latin American\nPhilosophy (particularly the work of Enrique Dussel) in dialogue with\nexistentialism and poststructuralism in order to develop the framework\nfor Latinx feminisms (Alcoff 2006, 2015).\n\nOne of the major frameworks of decolonial feminisms is \u201cthe\ncoloniality of power\u201d, a term first introduced by An\u00edbal\nQuijano, and defined as \u201cthe social classification of the\nworld\u2019s population around the idea of race\u201d (Quijano 2000:\n1). In this sense, the colonization of the Americas is not only a\nhistorical moment, but also the emergence of race and the subsequent\nreorganization of the globe in accordance with what Walter Mignolo\ncalls \u201cthe colonial difference\u201d, denoting the abstract\npositioning of Europe as the global hegemonic power (Mignolo 2002).\nDecolonial feminisms take an intersectional approach to the\ncoloniality of power and investigate, as Mar\u00eda Lugones says,\n\u201cthe emergence of hegemonic gender arrangements along\n\u2018racial\u2019 lines\u201d starting with the colonization of\nthe Americas (Lugones 2007: 190). Decolonial feminists such as Lugones\nand Wynter bring poststructuralist critique in dialogue with Latin\nAmerican philosophy and argue that dominant gender arrangements\nthemselves are colonial; these arrangements, such as patriarchy,\nheterosexualism, or gender dimorphism mark concrete historical\nprocesses of the racial inscription of gender norms, starting from and\nwith the coloniality of power (Lugones 2008; Oy\u011bw\u00f9m\u00ed\n2007; Wynter 2006).\n\nDecolonial feminisms\u2019 emphasis on historical critique is\ninseparable from a concern with the concrete lived experiences of\nwomen of color (Moraga and Anzald\u00faa 1981 [2015]; P\u00e9rez\n1999; Lugones 2007, Sandoval 2000). Gloria Anzald\u00faa, in\nBorderlands/La Frontera, emphasizes bordered thinking as the\nunderlying logic of contemporary systems of oppression, and she\nformulates the resistances of hybrid identities that emerge both out\nof and in response to such bordered thinking (Anzald\u00faa 1987).\nMariana Ortega develops Latina feminist phenomenology in emphasizing\nboth the lived experience of borderlands and exile, and the\npossibilities of resistance by developing \u201chome-tactics\u201d\nin and through these experiences (Ortega 2016).\n\nCoalitional thinking is a fundamental aspect of both post- and\ndecolonial feminist approaches. Mohanty calls for coalitions across\nborders in thinking through the concrete lived experiences and\nemphasizes the importance of situated and local struggles in\nunderstanding hegemonic power relations.  Moraga and Anzald\u00faa,\nin their coedited collection This Bridge Called My Back, call\nfor concrete and sustained coalitions that are based on an\nintersectional understanding of women\u2019s lives, rather than\nabstract calls for sisterhood. Decolonial feminists such as Lugones,\nChela Sandoval, Ortega, and Emma P\u00e9rez, maintain that\ncoalitional thinking cannot be an afterthought for any anti- or\ndecolonial struggles (P\u00e9rez 1999; Sandoval 2000).\n\nAs Continental feminism expands, it involves further conversations\nwith and in-between these approaches. The questions around the\n\u201ccontinent\u201d of Continental feminism, as well as how such a\ncontinent is situated within the colonial geographic boundaries of the\nWest and the Global North, continue to be challenged. As spaces for\nsuch a flow of ideas open up, further conversations on the possibility\nof coalition, as well as on challenging the limits of colonial thought\ncontinue to reshape the face of Continental feminism.\n",
