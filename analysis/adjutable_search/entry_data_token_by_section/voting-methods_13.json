The main goal is to characterize different voting\nmethods in terms of abstract principles of collective decision making.\nSee Pauly 2008 and Endriss 2011 for interesting discussions of\naxiomatic characterization results from a logician\u2019s point-of-view.\n\n\nConsult  List  2013  and Gaertner 2006 for introductions to \nthe vast literature on axiomatic characterizations in social choice theory. \nIn this article, I focus on a few key axioms and results and how they \nrelate to the voting methods and paradoxes discussed above. I start with \nthree core principles. \n\nAnonymity: The names of the voters do not matter: If two\nvoters swap their ballots, then the outcome of the election is\nunaffected.\nNeutrality: The names of the candidates, or alternatives, do not\nmatter: If two candidates are exchanged in every ballot, then the\noutcome of the election changes accordingly. \nUniversal Domain: There are no restrictions on the voter\u2019s\nchoice of ballots. In other words, no profile of ballots can be\nignored by a voting method. One way to make this precise is to require\nthat voting methods are total functions on the set of all\nprofiles (recall that a profile is a sequence of ballots, one from\neach voter). \n\n\nThese properties ensure that the outcome of an election depends only\non the voters\u2019 ballots, with all the voters and candidates being treated equally.\nOther properties are intended to rule out some of the paradoxes and\nanomalies discussed above. In section 4.1, there is an example of a\nsituation in which a candidate is elected, even though all\nthe voters prefer a different candidate. The next principle rules out\nsuch situations: \n\nUnanimity (also called the Pareto Principle): If candidate\n\\(A\\) is ranked above candidate \\(B\\) by all voters, then\ncandidate \\(B\\) should not win the election. \n\nThese are natural properties to impose on any voting method. A\nsurprising consequence of these properties is that they rule out\nanother natural property that one may want to impose: Say that a\nvoting method is resolute if the method always selects one\nwinner (i.e., there are no ties). Suppose that  \\(V\\) is a voting\nmethod that requires voters to rank the candidates and that there are\nat least 3 candidates and enough voters to form a Condorcet\ncomponent (a profile generating a majority cycle with voters evenly\ndistributed among the different rankings).  First, consider the situation when \nthere are exactly 3 candidates (in this case, we do not need to assume Unanimity).   \nDivide the set of voters into \nthree groups of size \\(n\\) and consider the Condorcet component: \n\n\n\n# VotersRanking\n\\(n\\)\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n\n\nBy  Universal Domain and resoluteness, \\(V\\) must select exactly one of \n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), or \\(C\\) as the winner.   Assume that \\(V\\) select \\(A\\) \nas the winner (the argument when \\(V\\) selects the other candidates is similar).  \nNow, consider the profile in which every  voter swaps candidate \\(A\\) \nand \\(B\\) in their rankings: \n\n\n\n# VotersRanking\n\\(n\\)\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(A\\s C\\s B\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\n\n\nBy Neutrality and Universal Domain, \\(V\\) must elect candidate \\(B\\) in this election scenario.  Now, consider the profile in which every voter in the above election scenario swaps candidates \\(B\\) and \\(C\\): \n\n\n\n# VotersRanking\n\\(n\\)\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n\\(n\\)\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n\n\nBy Neutrality and Universal Domain, \\(V\\) must elect candidate \\(C\\)\nin this election scenario.  Notice that this last election scenario\ncan be generated by permuting the voters in the first election\nscenario (to generate the last election scenario from the first\nelection scenario, move the first group of voters to the 2nd position,\nthe 2nd group of voters to the 3rd position and the 3rd group of\nvoters to the first position).  But this contradicts Anonymity since\nthis requires \\(V\\) to elect the same candidate in the first and third\nelection scenario. To extend this result to more than 3 candidates,\nconsider a profile in which candidates \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are all\nranked above any other candidate and the restriction to these three\ncandidates forms a Condorcet component.  If \\(V\\) satisfies Unanimity,\nthen no candidate except \\(A\\), \\(B\\) or \\(C\\) can be elected. Then,\nthe above argument shows that \\(V\\) cannot satisfy Resoluteness,\nUniversal Domain, Neutrality, and Anonymity.  That is, there are no\nResolute voting methods that satisfy Universal Domain, Anonymity,\nNeutrality, and Unanimity for 3 or more candidates (note that I have\nassumed that the number of voters is a multiple of 3, see Moulin 1983\nfor the full proof).\n\n\nSection 3.2 discussed examples in which candidates end up losing an\nelection as a result of more support from some of the voters. There\nare many ways to state properties that require a voting method to be\nmonotonic. The following strong version (called Positive\nResponsiveness in the literature) is used to characterize majority\nrule when there are only two candidates: \n\nPositive Responsiveness: If candidate \\(A\\) is a winner or\ntied for the win and moves up in some of the voter\u2019s rankings, then\ncandidate \\(A\\) is the unique winner. \n\nI can now state our first characterization result. Note that in all of\nthe example discussed above, it is crucial that there are three or\nmore candidates (for example, stating Condorcet\u2019s paradox requires there \nto be  three or more candidates). When there are only two\ncandidates, or alternatives, Majority Rule (choose the alternative ranked\nfirst by more than 50% of the voters) can be singled out as \u201cbest\u201d: \n\nTheorem (May 1952).\n\n  A voting method for choosing between two candidates satisfies\nNeutrality, Anonymity, Unanimity and Positive Responsiveness if and only if the\nmethod is majority rule.\n\n\nSee May 1952 for a precise statement of this theorem and Asan and\nSanver 2002, Maskin 1995, and Woeginger 2003 for \nalternative characterizations of majority rule. \n\n\nA key  assumption in the proof May\u2019s theorem and  subsequent  results is the \nrestriction to voting on  two  alternatives.  When there are only two \nalternatives, the definition of a ballot can be simplified since a \nranking of two alternatives boils down to selecting the alternative \nthat is ranked first.  The  above characterizations of Majority \nRule work in a more general setting since they  also allow  \nvoters to abstain  (which is ambiguous between not voting \nand being indifferent between the alternatives).  So, if the alternatives \nare  \\(\\{A,B\\}\\), then there are three possible ballots: selecting \\(A\\), \nselecting \\(B\\), or abstaining (which is treated as selecting both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)).  \nA natural question is whether there are May-style  characterization theorems \nfor more than two alternatives.    A crucial issue is  that  rankings of more than \ntwo alternatives are much more informative than selecting an alternative or abstaining.  By  restricting the information required \nfrom a  voter to selecting one of the alternatives or abstaining, \nGoodin and List 2006 prove that the  axioms used in May\u2019s Theorem characterize \nPlurality  Rule when there are more than two alternatives.  They also show that a\n minor  modification of the axioms characterize Approval Voting when voters are allowed to \n select more than one alternative. \n\n\n Note that  focusing on voting methods that limit the information required from \n the voters  to selecting one or more of the alternatives  hides all the interesting \n phenomena discussed in the previous sections, such as the existence of a Condorcet paradox.  \nReturning to the study of voting methods  that require voters to rank the alternatives, \nthe most important characterization result is Ken Arrow\u2019s celebrated impossibility \ntheorem (1963). Arrow showed that there is no social welfare function (a social\nwelfare function maps the voters\u2019 rankings (possibly allowing ties) to\na single social ranking) satisfying universal domain, unanimity,\nnon-dictatorship (there is no voter \\(d\\) such that for all profiles,\nif \\(d\\) ranks \\(A\\) above \\(B\\) in the profile, then the social\nordering ranks \\(A\\) above \\(B\\)) and the following key property: \n\n\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives: The social ranking\n(higher, lower, or indifferent) of two candidates \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\ndepends only on the relative rankings of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for each\nvoter. \n\nThis means that if the voters\u2019 rankings of two candidates \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are the same in two different election scenarios, then the\nsocial rankings of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be the same. This is a very\nstrong property that has been extensively criticized (see Gaertner,\n2006, for pointers to the relevant literature, and Cato, 2014, for a\ndiscussion of generalizations of this property). It is beyond the\nscope of this article to go into detail about the proof and the\nramifications of Arrow\u2019s theorem (see Morreau, 2014, for this\ndiscussion), but I note that many of the voting methods we have\ndiscussed do not satisfy the above property. A striking example of a\nvoting method that does not satisfy Independence of Irrelevant\nAlternatives is Borda Count. Consider the following two election\nscenarios:\n\n# Voters\nScenario 1Ranking\nScenario 2Ranking\n3\\(A\\s B\\s C\\s \\bX\\)\n\\(A\\s B\\s C\\s \\bX\\)\n\n2\\(B\\s C\\s A\\s \\bX\\)\n\\(B\\s C\\s \\bX\\s A\\)\n\n2\\(C\\s  A\\s  B\\s  \\bX\\)\n\\(C\\s  \\bX\\s A\\s B\\)\n\nScenario 1: The Borda ranking is \\(A >_{\\Borda} B >_{\\Borda} C >_{\\Borda} X\\)  (\\(\\BS(A)=15\\), \\(\\BS(B)=14\\), \\(\\BS(C)=13\\), and \\(\\BS(X)=0\\))\nScenario 2: The Borda ranking is \\(C >_{\\Borda} B >_{\\Borda} A >_{\\Borda} X\\)  (\\(\\BS(A)=11\\), \\(\\BS(B)=12\\), \\(\\BS(C)=13\\), and \\(\\BS(X)=6\\))\n\n\n\nNotice that the relative rankings of candidates \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\)\nare the same in both election scenarios. In the election scenario 2, the\nranking  of candidate \\(X\\), that is uniformly ranked in last place in\n election scenario 1, is changed. The ranking according to the\nBorda score of the candidates in election scenario 1 puts \\(A\\) first with 15\npoints, \\(B\\) second with 14 points, \\(C\\) third with 13 points, and\n\\(X\\) last with 0 points. In election scenario 2, the ranking of \\(A\\), \\(B\\)\nand \\(C\\) is reversed: Candidate \\(C\\) is first with 13 voters;\ncandidate \\(B\\) is second with 12 points; candidate \\(A\\) is third\nwith 11 points; and candidate \\(X\\) is last with 6 points. So, even\nthough the relative rankings of candidates \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) do\nnot differ in the two election scenarios, the position of candidate \\(X\\)\nin the voters\u2019 rankings reverses the Borda rankings of these candidates. \n\nIn Section 3.3, it was noted that a number of methods (including all\nCondorcet consistent methods) are susceptible to the multiple\ndistricts paradox. An example of a method that is not susceptible to\nthe multiple districts paradox is Plurality Rule: If a candidate\nreceives the most first place votes in two different districts, then\nthat candidate must receive the most first place votes in the combined\nthe districts. More generally, no scoring rule is susceptible to the\nmultiple districts paradox. This property is called reinforcement:\n\n\nReinforcement:\nSuppose that \\(N_1\\) and \\(N_2\\) are\ndisjoint sets of voters facing the same set of candidates. Further,\nsuppose that \\(W_1\\) is the set of winners for the population \\(N_1\\),\nand \\(W_2\\) is the set of winners for the population \\(N_2\\). If there\nis at least one candidate that wins both elections, then the winner(s)\nfor the entire population (including voters from both \\(N_1\\) and\n\\(N_2\\)) is the set of candidates that are in both \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\)\n(i.e., the winners for the entire population is \\(W_1\\cap W_2\\)).\n\nThe reinforcement property explicitly rules out the multiple-districts\nparadox (so, candidates that win all sub-elections are guaranteed to\nwin the full election). In order to characterize all scoring rules,\none additional technical property is needed: \n\nContinuity: Suppose that a group of voters \\(N_1\\) elects a\ncandidate \\(A\\) and a disjoint group of voters \\(N_2\\) elects a\ndifferent candidate \\(B\\). Then there must be some number \\(m\\) such\nthat the population consisting of the subgroup \\(N_2\\) together with\n\\(m\\) copies of \\(N_1\\) will elect \\(A\\).\n\nWe then have:\n\nTheorem (Young 1975).\n\nSuppose that \\(V\\) is a voting method that requires voters to rank the\ncandidates. Then, \\(V\\) satisfies Anonymity, Neutrality, Reinforcement\nand Continuity if and only if the method is a scoring rule.\n\n\nSee Merlin 2003 and Chebotarev and Smais 1998 for surveys of other\ncharacterizations of scoring rules. Additional axioms single out Borda\nCount among all scoring methods (Young 1974; Gardenfors 1973; Nitzan\nand Rubinstein 1981). In fact, Saari has argued that \u201cany fault\nor paradox admitted by Borda\u2019s method also must be admitted by all\nother positional voting methods\u201d (Saari 1989, pg. 454). For\nexample, it is often remarked that Borda Count (and all scoring rules)\ncan be easily manipulated by the voters. Saari (1995, Section 5.3.1)\nshows that among all scores rules Borda Count is the least susceptible\nto manipulation (in the sense that it has the fewest profiles where a\nsmall percentage of voters can manipulate the outcome). \n\nI have glossed over an important detail of Young\u2019s characterization of\nscoring rules. Note that the reinforcement property refers to the\nbehavior of a voting method on different populations of voters. To\nmake this precise, the formal definition of a voting method must allow for \ndomains that include profiles (i.e., sequences of ballots) of different\nlengths. To do this, it is convenient to assume that the domain of a\nvoting method is an anonymized profile: Given a set of ballots\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\), an anonymous profile is a function\n\\(\\pi:\\mathcal{B}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}\\). Let \\(\\Pi\\) be the set of\nall anonymous profiles. A variable domain voting method assigns\na non-empty set of voters to each anonymous profile\u2014i.e., it is a function\n\\(V:\\Pi\\rightarrow \\wp(X)-\\emptyset\\)). Of course, this builds in the\nproperty of Anonymity into the definition of a voting method. For this\nreason, Young (1975) does not need to state Anonymity as a\ncharacterizing property of scoring rules. \n\nYoung\u2019s axioms identify scoring rules out of the set of all functions\ndefined from ballots that are rankings of candidates. In order to\ncharacterize the voting methods from Section 2.2, we need to change\nthe set of ballots. For example, in order to characterize Approval\nVoting, the set of ballots \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is the set of non-empty\nsubsets of the set of candidates\u2014i.e.,\n\\(\\mathcal{B}=\\wp(X)-\\emptyset\\) (selecting the ballot \\(X\\)\nconsisting of all candidates means that the voter abstains).\nTwo additional axioms are needed to characterize Approval Voting:\n\n\nFaithfulness: If there is exactly one voter in the population,\nthen the winners are the set of voters chosen by that voter. \n\nCancellation: If all candidates receive the same number of\nvotes (i.e., they are elements of the same number of ballots) from the\nparticipating voters, then all candidates are winning. \n\nWe then have:\n\nTheorem (Fishburn 1978b; Alos-Ferrer 2006 ).\n\nA variable domain voting method where the ballots are non-empty sets\nof candidates is Approval Voting if and only if it satisfies\nFaithfulness, Cancellation, and Reinforcement.\n\n\nNote that Approval Voting satisfies Neutrality even though it is not\nlisted as one of the characterizing properties in the above\ntheorem. This is because Alos-Ferrer (2006) showed that Neutrality is\na consequence of Faithfulness, Cancellation and Reinforcement. See\nFishburn 1978a and Baigent and Xu 1991 for alternative\ncharacterizations of Approval Voting, and Xu 2010 for a survey of the\ncharacterizations of Approval Voting (cf. the characterization of\nApproval Voting from Goodin and List 2006). \n\nMyerson (1995) introduced a general framework for characterizing\nabstract scoring rules that include Borda Count and Approval\nVoting as examples. The key idea is to think of a ballot, called a\nsignal or a vote, as a function from candidates to a set\n\\(\\mathcal{V}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a set of numbers. That is,\nthe set of ballots is a subset of \\(\\mathcal{V}^X\\) (the set of functions\nfrom \\(X\\) to \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)). Then, an anonymous profile of signals\nassigns a score to each candidate \\(X\\) by summing the numbers\nassigned to \\(X\\) by each voter. This allows us to define voting methods \nby specifying the set of ballots: \n\nPlurality Rule: The ballots are functions assigning 0 or 1 to the\ncandidates such that exactly one candidate is assigned 1: \\(\\{v\\ |\\\nv\\in \\{0,1\\}^X\\) and there is an \\(A\\in X\\) such that \\(v(A)=1\\) and\nfor all \\(B\\), if \\(B\\ne A\\), then \\(v(B)=0\\}\\) \n Approval Voting: The ballots are functions assigning 0 or 1 to\nthe candidates: \\(\\{v\\ |\\ v\\in \\{0,1\\}^X \\}\\) \n Borda Count: The ballots are functions assigning numbers from the\nset \\(\\{\\#X, \\#X-1,\\ldots,0\\}\\) such that each candidate is assigned\nexactly one of the numbers: \\(\\{v\\ |\\ v\\in\\{\\# X, \\# X - 1, \\ldots,\n0\\}^X\\) such that \\(v\\) is a bijection\\(\\}\\) \n Range Voting: The ballots are assignments of real numbers between\n0 and 1 to candidates: \\([0,1]^X = \\{v \\ |\\ v:X\\rightarrow [0,1] \\}\\)\n\n Cumulative Voting: The ballots are assignments of real numbers\nbetween 0 and 1 to candidates such that the assignments sum to 1: \\(\n\\{v \\ |\\ v\\in [0,1]^X\\) and \\(\\sum_{A\\in X} v(A)=1\\}\\) \n Formal Utilitarian: The ballots are assignments of real numbers\nto candidates: \\(\\mathbb{R}^X = \\{v \\ |\\ v:X\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\\}\\).\n\n\n\nMyerson (1995) showed that an abstract voting rule is an abstract\nscoring rule if and only if it satisfies Reinforcement, Universal\nDomain (i.e. it is defined for all anonymous profiles), a version of\nthe Neutrality property (adapted to the more abstract setting), and\nthe Continuity property, which is called Overwhelming Majority.\nPivato (2013) generalizes this result, and Gaertner and Xu (2012)\nprovide a related characterization result (using different\nproperties). Pivato (2014) characterizes Formal Utilitarian and Range\nVoting within the class of abstract scoring rules, and Mace (2018)\nextends this approach to cover a wider class of grading voting methods\n(including Majority Judgement). \n",
