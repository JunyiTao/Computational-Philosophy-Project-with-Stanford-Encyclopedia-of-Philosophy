    "main_text": "Perfectionist Ethics\n2. Perfectionist Ethics\n\n\nPerfectionism as a moral theory directs human beings to protect and\npromote objectively good human lives. As such, it can take an egoistic\nor non-egoistic form. Egoistic forms of perfectionism are well\nrepresented in the history of moral philosophy. These theories direct\neach human being to perfect himself as much as possible, or at least\nto some threshold level. Egoistic forms of perfectionism need not be\nnarrowly self-interested. A number of perfectionist writers have held\nthat the good of others contributes substantially to one\u2019s own good\n(Green 1986; Hobhouse 1911). By promoting the good of others, one can\nthereby promote one\u2019s own good.  On such views, there is no deep\nconflict between one\u2019s own perfection and the perfection of\nothers. Non-egoistic forms of perfectionism, by contrast, allow for\nsuch conflicts. They hold that each human being has a non-derivative\nduty to perfect others as well as a duty to perfect himself. Such\nviews, at least in principle, can direct human beings to sacrifice\ntheir own perfection for the sake of\nothers.[3]\n\n\nWhether it takes an egoistic or non-egoistic form, perfectionism is\nbest understood as a moral theory that directs human beings to care\nabout the perfection of others as well as themselves. This claim is\nconsistent with recognizing, what is evidently true, that there are\nserious limits to our ability to bring about the perfection of others.\nThese limits explain why some philosophers, most notably Kant, have\nheld that we cannot have a duty to promote the perfection of others\n(Kant 1797). Many perfectionist goods require self-direction for their\nrealization. We cannot compel another to develop her capacities, at\nleast not all of them. Nor can we compel another to participate in\nvaluable social relationships. This valid point, however, should not be\noverstated. We can work to ensure that others live under conditions\nthat are conducive to their own self-development or their own\nrealization of perfectionist goods. Indirect promotion may be possible\nwhere direct promotion is not. The fact that human beings cannot\ndirectly bring about the perfection of others is nonetheless important.\nIt may explain why, in practice if not in principle, a plausible\nperfectionism would direct each human being to be more concerned with\nher own perfection than with the perfection of others.\n",
