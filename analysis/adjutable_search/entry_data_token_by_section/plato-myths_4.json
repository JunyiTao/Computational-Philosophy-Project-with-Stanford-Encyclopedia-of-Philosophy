Myth in the Timaeus\n\nThe cosmology of the Timaeus is a complex and ample\nconstruction, involving a divine maker (assisted by a group of less\npowerful gods), who creates the cosmos out of a given material\n(dominated by an inner impulse towards disorder) and according to an\nintelligible model. The cosmology as a whole is called both an\neik\u014ds muthos (29d, 59c, 68d) and an eik\u014ds\nlogos (30b, 48d, 53d, 55d, 56a, 57d, 90e). The expression\neik\u014ds muthos has been translated as \u2018probable\ntale\u2019 (Jowett), \u2018likely story\u2019 (Cornford),\n\u2018likely tale\u2019 (Zeyl). The standard interpretation is\npromoted by, among others, Cornford (1937, 31ff.). The\nTimaeus cosmology, Cornford argues, is a muthos\nbecause it is cast in the form of a narration, not as a piece-by-piece\nanalysis. But also, and mainly, because its object, namely the\nuniverse, is always in a process of becoming and cannot be really\nknown. Brisson (1998, ch. 13) offers a different solution, but along\nthe same lines. The cosmology, Brisson argues, is a non-verifiable\ndiscourse about the perceptible universe before and during its\ncreation. In other words: the cosmology is an eik\u014ds\nmuthos because it is about what happens to an eik\u014dn\nbefore, and during, its creation, when everything is so fluid that it\ncannot be really known. The standard alternative is to say that the\nproblem lies in the cosmologist, not in the object of his cosmology.\nIt is not that the universe is so unstable so that it cannot be really\nknown. It is that we fail to provide an exact and consistent\ndescription of it. A proponent of this view is Taylor (1928, 59). Rowe\n(2003) has argued that the emphasis at 29d2 is on the word\neik\u014ds, not muthos, and that here\nmuthos is used primarily as a substitute for logos\nwithout its typical opposition to that term (a view also held by\nVlastos (1939, 380\u20133)). Burnyeat (2009) argues that this\ncosmology is an attempt to disclose the rationality of the cosmos,\nnamely the Demiurge\u2019s reasons for making it thus and so. The\nword eik\u014ds (a participial form of the verb\neoika, \u201cto be like\u201d) is, argues Burnyeat, usually\ntranslated as \u201cprobable\u201d; but\u2014as textual evidence\nfrom Homer to Plato proves\u2014it also means\n\u201cappropriate\u201d, \u201cfitting\u201d, \u201cfair\u201d,\n\u201cnatural\u201d, \u201creasonable\u201d. Since the cosmology\nreveals what is reasonable in the eik\u014dn made by the\nDemiurge, it may rightly be called eik\u014ds,\n\u201creasonable\u201d. The Demiurge\u2019s reasoning, however, is\npractical, not theoretical. The Demiurge, Burnyeat claims, works with\ngiven materials, and when he creates the cosmos, he does not have a\nfree choice, but has to adjust his plans to them. Although we know\nthat the Demiurge is supremely benevolent towards his creation, none\nof us could be certain of his practical reasons for framing the cosmos\nthe way he did. That is why anyone aiming at disclosing them cannot\nbut come up with \u201cprobable\u201d answers. Plato\u2019s\ncosmology is then eik\u014ds in the two senses of the word,\nfor it is both \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cprobable\u201d.\nBut why does Plato call it a muthos? Because, Burnyeat\nargues, the Timaeus cosmology is also a theogony (for the\ncreated cosmos is for Plato a god), and this shows Plato\u2019s\nintention to overcome the traditional opposition between\nmuthos and logos.\n\nTimaeus speaks about the Demiurge\u2019s practical reasoning for\ncreating the cosmos as he did. No cosmologist can deduce these reasons\nfrom various premises commonly accepted. He has to imagine them, but\nthey are neither fantastical, nor sophistic. The cosmologist exercises\nhis imagination under some constraints. He has to come up with\nreasonable and coherent conjectures. And in good Socratic and Platonic\ntradition, he has to test them with others. This is what Timaeus does.\nHe expounds his cosmology in front of other philosophers, whom he\ncalls kritai, \u201cjudges\u201d (29d1). They are highly\nskilled and experienced philosophers: Socrates, Critias and\nHermocrates and at the beginning of the Critias, the sequel\nto the Timaeus, they express their admiration for\nTimaeus\u2019 cosmological account (107a). One may say that\nTimaeus\u2019 account has been peer-reviewed. The judges, however,\nsays Plato, have to be tolerant, for in this field one cannot provide\nmore than conjectures. Timaeus\u2019 cosmological discourse is not\naimed at persuading a less philosophically inclined audience to change\ntheir lives. It may be argued that its creationist scenario was meant\nto make the difficult topic of the genesis of the realm of becoming\nmore accessible. In the Philebus, in a tight dialectical\nconversation, the genesis of the realm of becoming is explained in\nabstract terms (the unlimited, limit, being that is mixed and\ngenerated out of those two; and the cause of this mixture and\ngeneration, 27b\u2013c). But the Timaeus aims at\nencompassing more than the Philebus. It aims not only at\nrevealing the ultimate ontological principles (accessible to human\nreason, cf. 53d), and at explaining how their interaction brings forth\nthe world of becoming, but also at disclosing, within a teleological\nframework, the reasons for which the cosmos was created the way it is.\nThese reasons are to be imagined because imagination has to fill in\nthe gaps that reason leaves in this attempt to disclose the reasons\nfor which the cosmos was created the way it is.\n",
