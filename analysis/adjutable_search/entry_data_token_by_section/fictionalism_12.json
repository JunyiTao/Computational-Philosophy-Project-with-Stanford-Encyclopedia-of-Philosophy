    "main_text": "Arguments against Fictionalism || The phenomenological objection\n4.1 The phenomenological objection\n\nThe most obvious objection to fictionalism is that it seems just\nabsurd to assimilate some seemingly sober discourse such as\nmathematical or modal or moral discourse to make-believe and fiction.\n(\u201cMathematical discourse just doesn\u2019t seem at all\nlike Cowboys and Indians.\u201d) This is an objection specifically\ntargeted against hermeneutic fictionalism; it is plainly irrelevant as\ndirected against a revolutionary fictionalist.\n\nWe have already seen some fictionalist replies to this objection. One\nreply (section 3.4) is that, philosophically interesting discourses\naside, we engage in make-believe and fiction more often than we\nordinarily tend to think. Another reply \u2014 related to the\ndistinctions drawn in section 2.4 \u2014 is that there are variants\nof fictionalism that do not claim there to be a close analogy between\nthe target discourse on the one hand and fiction and make-believe on\nthe other. For discussion of the phenomenological objection, see,\ne.g., Brock (2014).\n\nThere have been attempts to make what is essentially the\nphenomenological objection more precise. Jason Stanley (2001) has two\nrelated objections concerning the nature of the fictionalist\u2019s\nappeal to pretense. (i) The hermeneutic fictionalist says that we are\nengaged in make-believe where it doesn\u2019t seem to us that we are.\nHence, Stanley says, \u201cIf the hermeneutic fictionalist is\ncorrect, then x can bear the propositional attitude of\npretense toward a proposition, without it being in principle\naccessible to x that x bears the propositional\nattitude of pretense towards that proposition. But this introduces a\nnovel and quite drastic form of failure of first-person authority over\none\u2019s own mental states\u201d. (ii) By what the fictionalist\nsays, the same psychological mechanisms as are involved in\nmake-believe are involved in understanding the use of a discourse of\nwhich fictionalism is true. But it seems this can be shown to be\nproblematic on empirical grounds. Autistic persons have difficulties\nwith make-believe, so by the fictionalist\u2019s hypothesis they\nshould likewise have difficulties understanding the use of a discourse\nof which fictionalism is true. But autistic persons do not have\ndifficulties with mathematical discourse, or modal discourse, or\ndiscourse concerning negative existentials, etc. (For discussion of\nStanley\u2019s autism objection, see Liggins 2010.)\n\nA related but distinct concern is that the fictionalist draws a\ndistinction without a difference: there is no real difference between\nbelief and the supposedly distinct attitude that the fictionalist\nposits. (For discussion, see Daly (2008), Horwich (1991),\nO\u2019Leary-Hawthorne (1994), Rosen (forthcoming), Rosen and Burgess\n(2005), and Thomasson (2013.) As just stated, the objection may sound\nlike an obvious non-starter: of course there is a difference between\nbelief and whatever attitude it is that we take toward fiction. But\nthere are some reasons to still take the objection seriously. First,\nas discussed above, fictionalists do often appeal to a different\nattitude from the one we adopt toward paradigmatic cases of fiction,\nand for that reason alone one cannot move straight from the obvious\npossibility of engaging in fiction to the possibility of us doing what\nthe philosophical fictionalist says we do, or should do. Second,\ncharacteristic of fiction is that we often do abandon the perspective\ninternal to the fiction and instead adopt an external, critical\nperspective. Nothing similar seems to standardly be going on with,\nsay, mathematical discourse or moral discourse. However, these points\nnoted, it is still natural for the fictionalist to shrug off this\nconcern, saying with Rosen (forthcoming) that the question of whether\nsomeone who is generally disposed to behave as if p really believes\nthat p can be settled by what the person is disposed to say upon\nreflection regarding whether she believes that p or not.\n",
