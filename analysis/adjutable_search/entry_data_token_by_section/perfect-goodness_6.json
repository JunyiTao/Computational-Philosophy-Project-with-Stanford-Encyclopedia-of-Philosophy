    "main_text": "Is necessary perfect goodness possible? || Divine freedom\n5.2 Divine freedom\n\nAnother frequently-raised objection to the prospect of necessary\nperfect goodness concerns the relationship between freedom and moral\ngoodness (see, for example, Pike 1969, p. 215; Reichenbach 1982, pp.\n133\u2013134). Not all beings are subject to moral assessment; we do\nnot judge rocks to be dutiful because they never violate a moral duty.\nIt is plausibly thought that one of the features that a being must\nexhibit in order to be subject to moral assessment is freedom. We\nfrequently take as an excuse for morally bad behavior that the agent\nwas not really free not to act badly; such excuses function by\nclaiming that the conditions under which the agent acted preclude the\nagent\u2019s behavior from being used as a basis for morally\nassessing the agent. Generalizing from thoughts such as these, it is\nplausible to hold that God is subject to moral assessment \u2013\nincluding the assessment \u2018perfectly good\u2019 \u2013 only if\nGod acts freely. And even apart from the connection between being free\nand being subject to moral assessment, it seems to be a great-making\nfeature of a being that its agency is free agency. (See the entry on\n divine freedom.)\n\nIt seems, then, that we must think that God is free. There seems to be\nno conflict between holding that God is free and that God is perfectly\ngood. A free being may have a perfectly good set of desires, slate of\ncharacter traits, and career of actions. It may even be true that\nevery counterfactual about what that agent would freely do were\ncircumstances somewhat different involves that agent\u2019s agency\nbeing perfectly good. But there may be a conflict between holding that\nthe agent is free with respect to issues of moral relevance \u2013\nwhat has been called being \u201csignificantly\u201d free (Plantinga\n1979, p. 166) \u2013 and being necessarily perfectly good.\nFor many hold the view that freedom of action involves a capacity to\nact otherwise \u2013 that if an agent is free with respect to\n\u03c6-ing, then it is possible that A \u03c6s and it is possible that A\nrefrains from \u03c6-ing. But if freedom involves the possibility of\nacting either way with respect to matters of moral relevance, then a\nfree being cannot be necessarily perfectly good. For there is no\npossible world in which a necessarily perfectly good being acts\nwrongly; but for every significantly free being there is a possible\nworld in which that being acts wrongly.\n\nThere are various ways to resist this argument. Many\ncompatibilists about free will deny that this sort of ability\nto do otherwise is a requirement on freedom; even if they insist on\nthere being some possibility of the agent\u2019s acting otherwise\ngiven some alternative possible set of desires, they do not hold that\nat the point of action, with all held constant, it must be possible\nfor the agent to act otherwise. (See the entry on\n compatibilism.)\n So given compatibilism, we cannot object that God is unfree simply\nbecause at the point of divine choice the only real possibility is\nthat God declines to choose to do wrong. Furthermore, God\u2019s\nwilling is not constrained by anything other than the constraints of\nlogical possibility, and there is nothing that can (efficiently) cause\nGod to choose one way rather than other; God is the ultimate source of\nGod\u2019s action, such that nothing is causally explanatorily prior\nto God\u2019s choice. If compatibilism is the true view about the\nrelationship between freedom and the capacity to act otherwise, then\nit seems that the fact that there is no possible world in which God\nacts in any but the best way does not call into question that\naction\u2019s being free and thus subject to moral assessment.\n\nIncompatibilists about free will \u2013 those who hold that\nfree will is incompatible with determinism \u2013 have not been of\none mind about whether the ability to act otherwise is a condition of\nfree will, and if so, in what sense, or whether there is some other\nrequirement on free action in the vicinity. (See the entry on\n arguments for incompatibilism.)\n Those who hold to a strong version of the incompatibilist view might\nclaim that for an action to be free, then at the very point of\ndecision to perform the action, holding everything else constant, it\nmust be possible for the agent to choose to act one way or the other.\nSuch a view would indeed be incompatible with necessary moral goodness\non the assumption that only free action is creditable to the agent.\nBut other incompatibilists have held that even given a strong\nlibertarian account of free will, it is possible for there to be\nbeings whose orientation toward the good and vivid awareness of it is\nsuch that acting wrongly is not a real possibility for them. On such\nviews, it is possible for an agent to \u03c6 or not to \u03c6 only if\nthe agent judges there to be good reason to \u03c6 and good reason not\nto \u03c6 or there is some feature of that agent that is interfering\nwith that agent\u2019s orientation to act on what that agent judges\nthere to be good reason to do. So on Aquinas\u2019s view, while\nhumans in their natural state are capable of freely acting wrongly\nbecause they see some good in acting that way, in their glorified\nstate in heaven they are unable to sin, for they see no point in\nsinning and they are not such that their agency can be interfered with\nby external factors. It would be misleading to say that the glorified\nin heaven act rightly, but unwillingly; rather, they are hyper-willing\nto act rightly, and sinning is simply unthinkable, off the table, not\na serious deliberative possibility for them (Stump 1990; Kretzmann\n1991; see also Swinburne 1993, p. 202).\n\nThis condition of free perfect agency is realized to the greatest\nextent in God, it may be argued: nothing external to God can interfere\nwith God\u2019s willing, and God sees immediately and completely what\nis worth doing and why. On this view, God\u2019s choices against evil\nare free, even though doing wrong is not a serious deliberative\npossibility for God, and so there is no possible world in which God\nacts wrongly.\n\nIf one insists upon a libertarian account of free will in which to be\nfree with respect to an action requires the possibility of acting\notherwise, then the connection between freedom and moral assessability\nentails that God\u2019s lack of freedom to do evil precludes\nGod\u2019s being perfectly morally good. It is unclear how damaging\nthat outcome would be. If one is convinced that moral goodness is a\ngreat-making feature that God must exhibit, then there is a deep\nproblem for perfect being theology, as it seems that God must be free\nand God must be perfectly morally good, yet these cannot be\nco-realized. On the other hand, one might take this as occasion to\nreconsider whether divine perfection requires moral goodness: perhaps\nwhile moral goodness in the human case requires freedom, special\nfeatures of the divine case make that sort of freedom unnecessary\n(see, for example, Bergmann and Cover 2006); or perhaps the perfection\nof God\u2019s agency need not be moral perfection. (We will consider\nsome suggestions toward this latter possibility below.)\n",
