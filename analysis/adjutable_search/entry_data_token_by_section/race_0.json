    "main_text": "History of the Concept of Race\n1. History of the Concept of Race\n\nThe dominant scholarly position is that the concept of race is a\nmodern phenomenon, at least in Europe and the Americas. However, there\nis less agreement regarding whether racism, even absent a\ndeveloped race concept, may have existed in the ancient Greek and\nRoman worlds. The influential work of classicist Frank Snowden (1970;\n1983), who emphasized the lack of antiblack prejudice in the ancient\nworld, led many scholars of race to conclude that racism did not exist\nin that epoch. However, later classicists have responded that\nSnowden\u2019s work unnecessarily reduced all forms of racism to its\npeculiarly American version based on skin color and other markers of\nnon-white identity. Benjamin Isaac (2004) and Denise McCoskey (2012)\ncontend that the ancient Greeks and Romans did hold proto-racist views\nthat applied to other groups which today might be considered white.\nIsaac persuasively argues that these views must be considered\nproto-racist: although they were formed without the aid of a\nmodern race concept grounded in ideas of deterministic biology (2004,\n5), they nevertheless resembled modern racism by attributing \u201cto\ngroups of people common characteristics considered to be unalterable\nbecause they are determined by external factors or heredity\u201d\n(2004, 38). More importantly, both Isaac and McCoskey contend that\nancient proto-racism influenced the development of modern racism.\n\nPerhaps the first, unconscious stirrings of the concept of race arose\nwithin the Iberian Peninsula. Following the Moorish conquest of\nAndalusia in the eighth century C.E., the Iberian Peninsula became the\nsite of the greatest intermingling between Jewish, Christian, and\nMuslim believers. During and after their reconquista\n(reconquest) of the Muslim principalities in the peninsula, the\nCatholic Monarchs Isabel and Ferdinand sought to establish a uniformly\nChristian state by expelling first the Jews (in 1492) and then the\nMuslims (in 1502). But because large numbers of both groups converted\nto Christianity to avoid expulsion (and before this to avoid\npersecution), the monarchs distrusted the authenticity of these Jewish\nand Muslim conversos (converts). To ensure that only truly\nfaithful Christians remained within the realm, the grand inquisitor\nTorquemada reformulated the Inquisition to inquire not just into\ndefendants\u2019 religious faith and practices but into their\nlineage. Only those who could demonstrate their ancestry to those\nChristians who resisted the Moorish invasion were secure in their\nstatus in the realm. Thus, the idea of purity of blood was born\n(limpieza de sangre), not fully the biological concept of\nrace but perhaps the first occidental use of blood heritage as a\ncategory of religio-political membership (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\nvii; Hannaford 1996, 122\u2013126; Frederickson 2002,\n31\u201335).\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula may also have witnessed the first stirrings of\nantiblack and anti-Native-American racism. Since this region was the\nfirst in Europe to utilize African slavery while gradually rejecting\nthe enslavement of fellow European Christians, Iberian Christians may\nhave come to associate Black people as physically and mentally\nsuitable only for menial labor. In this they were influenced by Arab\nslave merchants, who assigned the worst tasks to their dark-skinned\nslaves while assigning more complex labor to light or tawny-skinned\nslaves (Frederickson 2002, 29). The \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the New\nWorld by Iberian explorers also brought European Christians into\ncontact with indigenous Americans for the first time. This resulted in\nthe heated debate in Valladolid in 1550 between Bartolom\u00e9 Las\nCasas and Gines de Sep\u00falveda over whether the Indians were by\nnature inferior and thus worthy of enslavement and conquest. Whether\ndue to Las Casas\u2019 victory over Sep\u00falveda, or due to the\nhierarchical character of Spanish Catholicism which did not require\nthe dehumanization of other races in order to justify slavery, the\nSpanish empire did avoid the racialization of its conquered peoples\nand African slaves. Indeed, arguably it was the conflict between the\nEnlightenment ideals of universal freedom and equality versus the fact\nof the European enslavement of Africans and indigenous Americans that\nfostered the development of the idea of race (Blum 2002,\n111\u2013112; Hannaford 1996, 149\u2013150).\n\nWhile events in the Iberian Peninsula may have provided the initial\nstirrings of modern racial sentiments, the concept of race, with its\nclose links to ideas of deterministic biology, emerged with the rise\nof modern natural philosophy and its concern with taxonomy (Smith\n2015). The first important articulation of the race concept came with\nthe 1684 publication of \u201cA New Division of the Earth\u201d by\nFrancois Bernier (1625\u20131688) (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, viii;\nHannaford 1996, 191, 203). Based on his travels through Egypt, India,\nand Persia, this essay presented a division of humanity into\n\u201cfour or five species or races of men in particular whose\ndifference is so remarkable that it may be properly made use of as the\nfoundation for a new division of the earth\u201d (Bernasconi and Lott\n2000, 1\u20132). First were the peoples inhabiting most of Europe and\nNorth Africa, extending eastward through Persia, northern and central\nIndia, and right up to parts of contemporary Indonesia. Despite their\ndiffering skin tones, these peoples nevertheless shared common\nphysical characteristics, such as hair texture and bone structure. The\nsecond race was constituted by the people of Africa south of the\nSahara Desert, who notably possessed smooth Black skin, thick noses\nand lips, thin beards, and wooly hair. The peoples inhabiting lands\nfrom east Asia, through China, today\u2019s central Asian states such\nas Uzbekistan, and westward into Siberia and eastern Russia\nrepresented the third race, marked by their \u201ctruly white\u201d\nskin, broad shoulders, flat faces, flat noses, thin beards, and long,\nthin eyes, while the short and squat Lapps of northern Scandinavia\nconstituted the fourth race. Bernier considered whether the indigenous\npeoples of the Americas were a fifth race, but he ultimately assigned\nthem to the first (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 2\u20133).\n\nBut while Bernier initiated the use of the term \u201crace\u201d to\ndistinguish different groups of humans based on physical traits, his\nfailure to reflect on the relationship between racial division and the\nhuman race in general mitigated the scientific rigor of his definition\n(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, viii). Central to a scientific concept of\nrace would be a resolution of the question of monogenesis versus\npolygenesis. Monogenesis adhered to the Biblical creation story in\nasserting that all humans descended from a common ancestor, perhaps\nAdam of the Book of Genesis; polygenesis, on the other hand, asserted\nthat different human races descended from different ancestral roots.\nThus, the former position contended that all races are nevertheless\nmembers of a common human species, whereas the latter saw races as\ndistinct species.\n\nDavid Hume\u2019s position on the debate between polygenesis versus\nmonogenesis is the subject of some scholarly debate. The bone of\ncontention is his essay \u201cOf National Characters,\u201d where he\ncontends that differences among European nations are attributable not\nto natural differences but to cultural and political influences.\nAmidst this argument against crude naturalism, Hume inserts a footnote\nin the 1754 edition, wherein he writes: \u201cI am apt to suspect\nthe negroes and in general all the other species of men (for there\nare four or five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to\nwhites. There never was a civilized nation of any other\ncomplexion than white, nor even any individual eminent either in\naction or speculation\u201d (Zack 2002, 15; emphasis added). Whereas\neven the most barbarous white nations such as the Germans \u201chave\nsomething eminent about them,\u201d the \u201cuniform and constant\ndifference\u201d in accomplishment between whites and non-whites\ncould not occur \u201cif nature had not made an original distinction\nbetwixt these breeds of men\u201d (Zack 2002, 15). Responding to\ncriticism, he softens this position in the 1776 edition, restricting\nhis claims to natural inferiority only to \u201cnegroes,\u201d\nstating that \u201cscarcely ever was a civilized nation of\nthat complexion, not even of individual eminent in action or\nspeculation\u201d (Zack 2002, 17; Hume 1776 [1987], 208; emphasis\nadded). Richard Popkin (1977) and Naomi Zack (2002, 13\u201318)\ncontend that the 1754 version of the essay assumes, without\ndemonstration, an original, polygenetic difference between white and\nnon-white races. Andrew Valls (2005, 132) denies that either version\nof the footnote espouses polygenesis.\n\nA strong and clear defense of monogenesis was provided by Immanuel\nKant (1724\u20131804) in his essay \u201cOf the Different Human\nRaces,\u201d first published in 1775 and revised in 1777. Kant argued\nthat all humans descend from a common human \u201clineal root\ngenus\u201d in Europe, which contained the biological\n\u201cseeds\u201d and \u201cdispositions\u201d that can generate\nthe distinct physical traits of race when triggered by divergent\nenvironmental factors, especially combinations of heat and humidity.\nThis, combined with patterns of migration, geographic isolation, and\nin-breeding, led to the differentiation of four distinct, pure races:\nthe \u201cnoble blond\u201d of northern Europe; the \u201ccopper\nred\u201d of America (and east Asia); the \u201cblack\u201d of\nSenegambia in Africa; and the \u201colive-yellow\u201d of\nAsian-India. Once these discrete racial groups were developed over\nmany generations, further climatic changes will not alter racial\nphenotypes (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 8\u201322).\n\nYet despite the distinction generated between different races,\nKant\u2019s monogenetic account led him to maintain that the\ndifferent races were part of a common human species. As evidence, he\nadduced the fact that individuals from different races were able to\nbreed together, and their offspring tended to exhibit blended physical\ntraits inherited from both parents. Not only did blending indicate\nthat the parents were part of a common species; it also indicated that\nthey are of distinct races. For the physical traits of parents of the\nsame race are not blended but often passed on exclusively: a blond\nwhite man and a brunette white woman may have four blond children,\nwithout any blending of this physical trait; whereas a Black man and a\nwhite woman will bear children who blend white and Black traits\n(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 9\u201310). Such inter-racial mixtures\naccounted for the existence of liminal individuals, whose physical\ntraits seem to lie between the discrete boundaries of one of the four\nraces; peoples who do not fit neatly into one or another race are\nexplained away as groups whose seeds have not been fully triggered by\nthe appropriate environmental stimuli (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n11).\n\nThe \u201cscience\u201d of race was furthered by the man sometimes\nconsidered to be the father of modern anthropology, Johann Friedrich\nBlumenbach (1752\u20131840). In his doctoral dissertation, \u201cOn\nthe Natural Variety of Mankind,\u201d first published in 1775,\nBlumenbach identified four \u201cvarieties\u201d of mankind: the\npeoples of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. His essay was revised\nand republished both in 1781, wherein he introduced a fifth variety of\nmankind, that inhabiting the South Pacific islands, and in 1795,\nwherein he first coined the term \u201cCaucasian\u201d to describe\nthe variety of people inhabiting Europe, West Asia, and Northern\nIndia. This term reflected his claim that this variety originated in\nthe Caucuses mountains, in Georgia, justifying this etiology through\nreference to the superior beauty of the Georgians. The 1795 version\nalso included the terms Mongolian to describe the non-Caucasian\npeoples of Asia, Ethiopian to signify Black Africans, American to\ndenote the indigenous peoples of the New World, and Malay to identify\nthe South Pacific Islanders (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 27\u201333;\nHannaford 1996, 207).\n\nWhile noting differences in skin tone, he based his varieties upon the\nstructures of the cranium, which supposedly gave his distinctions a\nstronger scientific foundation than the more superficial\ncharacteristic of color (Hannaford 1996, 206). In addition, he\nstrongly denied polygenetic accounts of racial difference, noting the\nability of members of different varieties to breed with each other,\nsomething that humans were incapable of doing with other species.\nIndeed, he took great pains to dismiss as spurious accounts of\nAfricans mating with apes or of monstrous creatures formed through the\nunion of humans with other animals (Hannaford 1996, 208\u2013209). In\nfinal support of his more scientific, monogenist approach, Blumenbach\nposited the internal, biological force which generated racial\ndifference, the \u201cnisus formativus,\u201d which when triggered\nby specific environmental stimuli generated the variations found\nwithin the varieties of humans (Hannaford 1996, 212).\n\nDespite the strong monogenist arguments provided by Kant and\nBlumenbach, polygenesis remained a viable intellectual strain within\nrace theory, particularly in the \u201cAmerican School of\nAnthropology,\u201d embodied by Louis Agassiz, Robins Gliddon, and\nJosiah Clark Nott. Agassiz was born in Switzerland, received an M.D.\nin Munich and later studied zoology, geology, and paleontology in\nvarious German universities under the influence of Romantic scientific\ntheories. His orthodox Christian background initially imbued him with\na strong monogenist commitment, but upon visiting America and seeing\nan African American for the first time, Agassiz experienced a type of\nconversion experience, which led him to question whether these\nremarkably different people could share the same blood as Europeans.\nEventually staying on and making his career in America, and\ncontinually struck by the physical character of African Americans,\nAgassiz officially announced his turn to polygenesis at the 1850\nmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS) in Charleston, South Carolina. Nott, a South Carolina\nphysician, attended the same AAAS meeting and, along with Gliddon,\njoined Agassiz in the promulgation of the American School\u2019s\ndefense of polygenesis (Brace 2005, 93\u2013103).\n\nAlong with Agassiz, Nott was also influenced by the French romantic\nrace theorist Arthur de Gobineau (1816\u20131882), whose \u201cEssay\non the Inequality of the Human Races\u201d (1853\u20131855) Nott\npartially translated into English and published for the American\naudience. Although the Catholic Gobineau initially espoused\nmonogenesis, he later leaned towards polygenesis and ended up\nambivalent on this issue (Hannaford 1996, 268\u2013269).\nNevertheless, Gobineau lent credence to the white racial supremacy\nthat Nott supported (Brace 2005, 120\u2013121). Gobineau posited two\nimpulses among humans, that of attraction and repulsion. Civilization\nemerges when humans obey the law of attraction and intermingle with\npeoples of different racial stocks. According the Gobineau, the white\nrace was created through such intermingling, which allowed it alone to\ngenerate civilization, unlike the other races, which were governed\nonly by the law of repulsion. Once civilization is established,\nhowever, further race mixing leads to the degeneration of the race\nthrough a decline in the quality of its blood. Consequently, when the\nwhite race conquers other Black or yellow races, any further\nintermingling will lead it to decline. Thus, Gobineau claimed that the\nwhite race would never die so long as its blood remains composed of\nits initial mixture of peoples. Notably, Nott strategically excised\nthose sections discussing the law of attraction when translating\nGobineau\u2019s essay for an American audience (Bernasconi and Lott\n2000, 45\u201351).\n\nEventually, polygenesis declined through the intellectual success of\nCharles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution (Brace 2005, 124). Darwin\nhimself weighed in on this debate in the chapter \u201cOn the Races\nof Man\u201d in his book The Descent of Man (1871), arguing\nthat as the theory of evolution gains wider acceptance, \u201cthe\ndispute between the monogenists and the polygenists will die a silent\nand unobserved death\u201d (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 68), with the\nformer winning out. The rest of the essay entertained both sides of\nthe debate regarding whether or not different races constitute\ndifferent species or sub-species of humans. Although Darwin did not\nexplicitly take sides in this debate, the preponderance of his\nargument gives little support to the idea of races being different\nspecies. For instance, he noted that couples from different races\nproduce fertile offspring, and that individuals from different races\nseem to share many mental similarities. That said, while Darwinian\nevolution may have killed off polygenesis and the related idea that\nthe races constituted distinct species, it hardly killed off race\nitself. Darwin himself did not think natural selection would by itself\ngenerate racial distinctions, since the physical traits associated\nwith racial differences did not seem sufficiently beneficial to favor\ntheir retention; he did, however, leave open a role for sexual\nselection in the creation of races, through repeated mating among\nindividuals with similar traits (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n77\u201378). Consequently, later race thinkers would replace\npolygenesis with natural selection and sexual selection as scientific\nmechanisms whereby racial differentiation could slowly,\nunintentionally, but nevertheless inevitably proceed (Hannaford 1996,\n273).\n\nSexual selection became a central focus for race-thinking with the\nintroduction of the term \u201ceugenics\u201d in 1883 by Francis\nGalton (1822\u20131911) in his essay \u201cInquiries into Human\nFaculty and Development\u201d (Hannaford 1996, 290). Focusing on\nphysical as opposed to \u201cmoral\u201d qualities, Galton advocated\nselective breeding to improve the \u201chealth, energy, ability,\nmanliness, and courteous disposition\u201d of the human species in\nhis later essay \u201cEugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and\nAims\u201d (Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 80). Following the same\ncurrents of \u201cSocial Darwinism\u201d that advocated the\nevolutionary improvement of the human condition through active human\nintervention, Galton proposed making eugenics not only an element in\npopular culture or \u201ca new religion\u201d (Bernasconi and Lott\n2000, 82) but even a policy enforced by the American government. While\npositive eugenics, or the enforced breeding of higher types, never\nbecame law, negative eugenics, or the sterilization of the\nfeebleminded or infirm, did become public policy enforced by a number\nof American states and upheld by the United States Supreme Court in an\neight-to-one decision in Buck v. Bell (274 U.S. 200, 1927).\nThe widespread acceptance of negative eugenics can be inferred by the\nfact that the Court Opinion justifying the decision was authored by\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes, a figure usually associated with\nprogressive and civil libertarian positions, and whose doctrine of\n\u201cclear and present danger\u201d sought to expand the protection\nof free speech.\n\nThe apogee of post-Darwinian race-thinking was arguably reached in the\nbook The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century by Houston\nStewart Chamberlain (1855\u20131927), the son-in-law of German opera\ncomposer Richard Wagner. Chamberlain argued in the evolutionary terms\nof sexual selection that distinct races emerged through geographical\nand historical conditions which create inbreeding among certain\nindividuals with similar traits (Hannaford 1996, 351). Moving from\nthis initial specification, Chamberlain then argued that the key\nstrands of western civilization\u2014Christianity and ancient Greek\nphilosophy and art\u2014emerged from the Aryan race. Jesus, for\ninstance, was held to be of Aryan stock, despite his Jewish religion,\nsince the territory of Galilee was populated by peoples descended from\nAryan Phonecians as well as by Semitic Jews. Similarly,\nAristotle\u2019s distinction between Greeks and Barbarians was\nreinterpreted as a racial distinction between Aryans and non-Aryans.\nThese Greek and Christian strands became united in Europe,\nparticularly during the Reformation, which allowed the highest,\nTeutonic strain of the Aryan race to be freed from constraining Roman\nCatholic cultural fetters. But while Roman institutions and practices\nmay have constrained the Teutonic Germans, their diametric opposite\nwas the Jew, the highest manifestation of the Semitic Race. The\nEuropean religious tensions between Christian and Jew were thus\ntransformed into racial conflicts, for which conversion or ecumenical\ntolerance would have no healing effect. Chamberlain\u2019s writings,\nnot surprisingly, have come to be seen as some of the key intellectual\nfoundations for twentieth century German anti-Semitism, of which Adolf\nHitler was simply its most extreme manifestation.\n\nIf Chamberlain\u2019s writings served as intellectual fodder for\nGerman racial prejudice, Madison Grant (1865\u20131937) provided\nsimilar foundations for American race prejudice against Black people\nand Native Americans in his popular book The Passing of the Great\nRace (1916). Rejecting political or educational means of\nameliorating the destitution of the subordinate racial groups in\nAmerica, Grant instead advocated strict segregation and the\nprohibition of miscegenation, or the interbreeding of members of\ndifferent races (Hannaford 1996, 358). Like Galton, Grant had similar\nsuccess in influencing American public policy, both through the\nimposition of racist restrictions on immigration at the federal level\nand through the enforcement of anti-miscegenation laws in thirty\nstates, until such prohibitions were finally overturned by the United\nStates Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia (388 U.S. 1\n[1967]).\n\nIf the apogee of biological race was reached in the early twentieth\ncentury, its decline began at about the same time. While writers such\nas Chamberlain and Grant popularized and politicized biological\nconceptions of race hierarchy, academic anthropologists since\nBlumenbach gave the concept of race its scientific validity. But\nacademic anthropology also provided the first challenge to biological\nrace in the person of Columbia University professor Franz Boas\n(1858\u20131942), a German-born Jewish immigrant to the United\nStates. Boas challenged the fixed character of racial groups by taking\non one of the key fundaments to racial typology, cranium size. Boas\nshowed that this characteristic was profoundly affected by\nenvironmental factors, noting that American-born members of various\n\u201cracial\u201d types, such as Semitic Jews, tended to have\nlarger crania than their European-born parents, a result of\ndifferences in nourishment. From this he concluded that claims about\nracially differential mental capacities could similarly be reduced to\nsuch environmental factors. In so doing, Boas undermined one measure\nof racial distinction, and although he did not go so far as to reject\nentirely the concept of biological race itself, he strongly influenced\nanthropologists to shift their focus from putatively fixed biological\ncharacteristics to apparently mutable cultural factors in order to\nunderstand differences among human groups (Bernasconi and Lott 2000,\n84\u201388; Brace 2005, 167\u2013169; Cornell and Hartmann 1998,\n42\u201343).\n\nA stronger anthropological rejection of the biological conception of\nrace was leveled by Ashley Montagu (1905\u20131999). Drawing on\ninsights from modern, experimental genetics, Montagu forcefully argued\nthat the anthropological conception of race relied on grouping\ntogether various perceptible physical characteristics, whereas the\nreal building blocks of evolution were genes, which dictated\nbiological changes among populations at a much finer level. The\nmorphological traits associated with race, thus, were gross aggregates\nof a variety of genetic changes, some of which resulted in physically\nperceptible characteristics, many others of which resulted in\nimperceptible changes. Moreover, since genetic evolution can occur\nthrough both the mixture of different genes and the mutation of the\nsame gene over generations, the traits associated with races cannot be\nattributed to discrete lines of genetic descent, since the dark skin\nand curly hair of one individual may result from genetic mixture while\nthe same traits in another individual may result from genetic mutation\n(Bernasconi and Lott 2000, 100\u2013107). Montagu\u2019s efforts\neventually resulted in the publication of an official statement\ndenying the biological foundations of race by the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1950,\nalthough it would take until 1996 for the American Association of\nPhysical Anthropologists (AAPA) to publish a similar document (Brace\n2005, 239).\n",
