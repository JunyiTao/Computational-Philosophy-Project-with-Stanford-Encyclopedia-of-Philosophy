    "main_text": "The Timing Puzzle || Atemporalism\n4.5 Atemporalism\n\nSuppose we conclude that there just is no (stretch of) time, whether\nwith blurry edges or not, at which we are made worse off than we\notherwise would be by a death that precludes our having goods we\notherwise would have. Given the Epicurean presumption, we would have\nto conclude that it is not bad for us to be deprived of such goods by\ndeath. But of course we need not accept this conclusion. We can\ninstead reject the Epicurean presumption. Being deprived of goods by\ndeath is bad for us, we can say, if, and insofar as, it is overall bad\nfor us simpliciter, and to be overall bad for us\nsimpliciter, there need not be a time at which death\nmakes us worse off than we otherwise would be. There need be no time\nat which death makes our welfare level lower than it otherwise would\nbe. Death can preclude our enjoying years of pleasant activities,\nmaking our lives worse than they would have been had we not died, even\nif at no time we are worse off than we would be had our lives not been\ncut short.\n\nIsn\u2019t it still possible to raise a question about timing,\nnamely: if death is overall bad simpliciter for those who are\ndeprived of happy years, at what time is it bad for them? This\nquestion does indeed arise, but it is not the timing question we have\nbeen asking, and an answer to the one is not an answer to the other.\nThe answer to the new question is this: if true at all, the\nproposition that death is overall bad for us simpliciter is\nan eternal, a timeless, truth (Feldman 1991). A timeless truth is a\nproposition that is true at all times if true at all. That 6 is less\nthan 7 is an example. That the welfare level Harry accrued today is\nlower than the welfare level Mary accrued today is another example.\nAnd so is the proposition that Sam\u2019s death is overall bad for\nhim simpliciter. It amounts to the claim that Sam\u2019s\nactual lifetime welfare level is lower than the lifetime welfare level\nSam would have accrued had he not died. Jens Johansson (2013) coined\nthe term atemporalism for the view that \u201cdeath is bad\nfor the deceased but not at any time.\u201d (For further discussion\nof atemporalism see Lamont 1998, Silverstein 2000 and Feit 2002.)\n5. Further Reservations Concerning the Harm Theses\n\nBefore we move on, let us consider some further objections to the harm\nthesis and the deprivationist defense of it.\n5.1 Harmless Preclusion\n\nAnother worry about the deprivationist defense is that deprivationism\nappeals to comparativism, and comparativism says that an event or\nstate of affairs harms me, in that it is bad for me, when my life\nwould have been better for me, my lifetime welfare higher, had that\nthat event not occurred. However, there seem to be exceptions.\n\nI am not harmed, it seems, by failing to be brilliant, or rich and\nbeautiful. But compare my life as it is, with my unimpressive IQ,\nincome and looks, to my life as it would be were I brilliant or rich\nor beautiful: the former is considerably worse than the latter. My\nnot being a genius (or rich and so forth) precludes my coming\nto have many goods. It makes my life worse than it otherwise would be,\nso comparativism seems to imply that not being a genius is bad for me.\nSuppose you have the winning Mega Millions jacpot ticket, and you\ndecide to give it to me. Before you hand it over, you have a stroke\nand die. Has your death harmed me?\n\nEpicureans might renew their attack on the harm thesis by exploiting\nexamples like these. The examples appear to show that things can have\nenormous negative value for me without harming me. Similarly,\nEpicureans might insist, the preclusion of goods by death is harmless:\ncut short, my life is worse than it would be were I not to die, but\nthis comparative difference does not show that I am harmed.\n\nIt seems that the comparative criteria work well when we evaluate\nlosses, such as the loss of my arms, and also when we evaluate some\nlacks, such as the inability to see or to feel pleasure. But,\narguably, the criteria have worrisome implications when we evaluate\ncertain other lacks, such as my lack of genius. It is relatively clear\nthat a person is harmed by the inability to see but less clear that he\nis harmed by the lack of genius. Why is that?\n\nNagel seems inclined to think that the solution is to \u201cset some limits\non how possible a possibility must be for its nonrealization to be a\nmisfortune,\u201d but also mentions that we might not regard, as a\nmisfortune, \u201cany limitation, like mortality, that is normal to the\nspecies.\u201d Draper suggests that harmless preclusion involves cases in\nwhich the events or states of affairs that would be good for us if\nthey held are highly improbable (Draper 1999). Another explanation\nmight focus on the relative importance of having some goods rather\nthan others. In some moods, we may consider it harmful to be deprived\nof a good just when it is important for us to have it. The troublesome\nlacks we have been discussing might be lacks of goods it is\nunimportant to have; such lacks would not be harmful even though we\nwould be better off without them. (But if, against all odds, a person\nis a genius, or rich, or beautiful, would taking these away\nbe harmless to her?)\n5.2 The Symmetry Argument\n\nLucretius, a follower of Epicurus, extended Epicurus\u2019s case\nagainst the harm thesis. The argument he developed involved a thought\nexperiment:\n\nLook back at time \u2026 before our birth. In this way Nature holds\nbefore our eyes the mirror of our future after death. Is this so grim,\nso gloomy? (Lucretius 1951)\n\n\nAccording to his symmetry argument, it is irrational to object to\ndeath, assuming it ends our existence, since we do not find it\nobjectionable that we failed to exist prior to being alive, and the\nway things were for us while not existing then is just like\nthe way things will be for us after death ends our existence;\nour pre-vital nonexistence and our posthumous nonexistence are\nsymmetrical, alike in all relevant respects, so that any objection to\nthe one would apply to the other.\n\nLucretius\u2019s argument admits of more than one interpretation,\ndepending on whether it is supposed to address death understood as\ndying or as being dead (or both).\n\nOn one interpretation, the argument is this: the ending of life is not\nbad, since the only thing we could hold against it is the fact that it\nis followed by our nonexistence, yet the latter is not objectionable,\nas is shown by the fact that we do not object to our nonexistence\nbefore birth. So understood, the symmetry argument is weak. It would\nhave some force for someone who thought initially that death puts us\ninto a state or condition that is ghastly, perhaps painful, but that\nneed not be our complaint. Instead, our complaint might be that death\nprecludes our having more good life. Notice that the mirror image of\ndeath is birth (or, more precisely, becoming alive), and the two\naffect us in very different ways: birth makes life possible; if a life\nends up being good for us, birth starts a good thing going. Death\nmakes further life impossible; it brings a good thing to a close.\n\nPerhaps Lucretius only meant to argue that being dead is not\nbad, since the only thing we could hold against it is our\nnonexistence, which is not really objectionable, as witness our\nattitude about pre-vital nonexistence. So interpreted, there is a\nkernel of truth in Lucretius\u2019s argument. Truly, our pre-vital\nnonexistence does not concern us much. But perhaps that is because our\npre-vital nonexistence is followed by our existence. Perhaps we would\nnot worry overly about our post-vital nonexistence if it, too, were\nfollowed by our existence. If we could move in and out of existence,\nsay with the help of futuristic machines that could dismantle us, then\nrebuild us, molecule by molecule, after a period of nonexistence, we\nwould not be overly upset about the intervening gaps, and, rather like\nhibernating bears, we might enjoy taking occasional breaks from life\nwhile the world gets more interesting. But undergoing temporary\nnonexistence is not the same as undergoing permanent nonexistence.\nWhat is upsetting might be the permanence of post-vital\nnonexistence\u2014not nonexistence per se.\n\nThere is another way to use considerations of symmetry against the\nharm thesis: we want to die later, or not at all, because it is a way\nof extending life, but this attitude is irrational, Lucretius might\nsay, since we do not want to be born earlier (we do not want to have\nalways existed), which is also a way to extend life. As this argument\nsuggests, we are more concerned about the indefinite\ncontinuation of our lives than about their indefinite\nextension. (Be careful when you rub the magic lamp: if you\nwish that your life be extended, the genie might make you older!) A\nlife can be extended by adding to its future \\(or\\) to its past. Some\nof us might welcome the prospect of having lived a life stretching\nindefinitely into the past, given fortuitous circumstances. But we\nwould prefer a life stretching indefinitely into the future.\n\nIs it irrational to want future life more than past life? No; it is\nnot surprising to find ourselves with no desire to extend life into\nthe past, since the structure of the world permits life extension only\ninto the future, and that is good enough. But what if life extension\nwere possible in either direction? Would we still be indifferent about\na lengthier past? And should our attitude about future life match our\nattitude about past life?\n\nOur attitude about future life should match our attitude about past\nlife if our interests and attitudes are limited in certain ways. If\nquantity of life is the only concern, a preference for future life is\nirrational. Similarly, the preference is irrational if our only\nconcern is to maximize how much pleasure we experience over the course\nof our lives without regard to its temporal distribution. But our\nattitude is not that of the life- or pleasure-gourmand.\n\nAccording to Parfit, we have a far-reaching bias extending to goods in\ngeneral: we prefer that any good things, not just pleasures, be in our\nfuture, and that bad things, if they happen at all, be in our past. He\nargues that if we take this extensive bias for granted, and assume\nthat, because of it, it is better for us to have goods in the future\nthan in the past, we can explain why it is rational to deplore death\nmore than we do our not having always existed: the former, not the\nlatter, deprives us of good things in the future (he need not say that\nit is because it is in the past that we worry about the life-limiting\nevent at the beginning of our lives less than the life-limiting event\nat the end). This preference for future goods is unfortunate, however,\naccording to Parfit. If cultivated, the temporal insensitivity of the\nlife- or pleasure-gourmand could lower our sensitivity to death:\ntowards the end of life, we would find it unsettling that our supply\nof pleasures cannot be increased in the future, but we would be\ncomforted by the pleasures we have accumulated.\n\nWhether or not we have the extensive bias described by Parfit, it is\ntrue that the accumulation of life and pleasure, and the passive\ncontemplation thereof, are not our only interests. We also have\nactive, forward\u2013looking goals and concerns. Engaging in such\npursuits has its own value; for many of us, these pursuits, and not\npassive interests, are central to our \u2018identities\u2019, our\nfundamental values and commitments. However, we cannot make and pursue\nplans for our past. We must project our plans (our\nself\u2013realization) into the future, which explains our forward\nbias. (We could have been devising and pursuing plans in the\npast, but these plans will not be extensions of our present concerns.)\nIt is not irrational to prefer that our lives be extended into the\nfuture rather than the past, if for no other reason than this: only\nthe former makes our existing forward-looking pursuits possible. It is\nnot irrational to prefer not to be at the end of our lives, unable to\nshape them further, and limited to reminiscing about days gone by. As\nFrances Kamm (1998, 2021) emphasizes, we do not want our lives to be\nall over with.\n\nNevertheless, it does not follow that we should be\nindifferent about the extent of our pasts. Being in the grip\nof forward-looking pursuits is important, but we have passive\ninterests as well, which make a more extensive past preferable.\nMoreover, having been devising and pursuing plans in the past\nis worthwhile. If fated to die tomorrow, most of us would prefer to\nhave a thousand years of glory behind us rather than fifty. We want to\nhave lived well.\n\nIn \u201cDeath\u201d Thomas Nagel offered a response to Lucretius\nthat has been widely discussed. It is entirely reasonable not to want\nto come into existence earlier even though we want to live longer,\nNagel said, because it is metaphysically impossible for a person to\nhave come into existence significantly earlier than she did, even\nthough it is possible for a person to have existed longer than she\nactually did. However, his response hinges on questionable assumptions\nabout the essential features of people\u2019s origins, as Nagel\nacknowledges (in footnote 3 of the reprint of \u201cDeath\u201d in\nhis collection Mortal Questions.) Imagine someone who\noriginated from a zygote that had been frozen for a very long time.\nMightn't that zygote have been frozen for a brief time instead?\nWouldn\u2019t that be a way for this person to have come into\nexistence far earlier than she did?\n\nAccording to Frederik Kaufman (2016, p. 63), this thought experiment\n(perhaps tweaked a bit) might provide a way in which a human\norganism could have come into existence far earlier than she\ndid, but it does not provide a way in which a person could\nhave come into existence far earlier. \u201cPersons (properly\nunderstood) cannot exist earlier than they do.\u201d He bases this\nview on the assumption\u2014challenged by animalists but defended by\nParfit\u2014that persons are objects (distinct from organisms) with\npsychological persistence conditions, chief among which is\npsychological continuity, together with the assumption that \u201cif\nmental continuity is constitutive of personal identity, then when a\nparticular consciousness emerges is essential to that\nperson.\u201d\n6. Posthumous Harm\n\nAccording to Aristotle,\n\na dead man is popularly believed to be capable of having both good and\nill fortune\u2014honour and dishonour and prosperity and the loss of\nit among his children and descendants generally\u2014in exactly the\nsame way as if he were alive but unaware or unobservant of what was\nhappening (Nicomachean Ethics 1.10)\n\n\nThe belief Aristotle reported in this passage is that a person may be\nbenefitted or harmed by things that happen while she is dead. Nagel\n(1970, p. 66) agrees; drawing upon his indefinitist approach he says\nthat \u201ca man's life includes much that does not take place within\nthe boundaries \u2026 of his life\u201d and that \u201cthere is a\nsimple account of what is wrong with breaking a deathbed promise. It\nis an injury to the dead man.\u201d If something that occurs while a\nperson is dead is bad for her, let us say that it is responsible for\nposthumous harm. (But this way of speaking is potentially\nmisleading, as theorists who argue that posthumous events may harm us\nneed not assume that the victims are worse off while they are dead.)\nIs there such a thing as posthumous harm?\n6.1 Doubts About Posthumous Harm\n\nThe main reason to doubt the possibility of posthumous harm is the\nassumption that it presupposes the (dubious) possibility of backwards\ncausation. As Ernest Partridge wrote, \u201cafter death no events can\nalter a moment of a person's life\u201d (1981, p. 248). The dead may\nbe wronged, Partridge thought, but being wronged is not a kind of\nharm. (The claim that a person may be wronged by actions others take\nafter she is dead is itself quite controversial. Like Partridge, some\ntheorists think that people may be wronged but not harmed\nposthumously. Priorists typically argue that both are possible, while\nother, theorists, such as J.S. Taylor 2012, argue that neither is\npossible.)\n\nWe might also question the possibility of posthumous harm by drawing\non the assumption (made by Mark Bernstein 1998, p. 19, and Walter\nGlannon 2001, p. 138, among others) that something is intrinsically\ngood or bad for a person only if it reduces to her intrinsic,\nnon-relational properties. For simplicity, we can focus on one version\nof this view, namely intrinsic hedonism. Suppose we assume that a\nperson is harmed only by what is intrinsically or extrinsically bad\nfor her, that intrinsic hedonism is the correct account of intrinsic\nharm and comparativism is the correct account of extrinsic harm, and\nalso that the termination thesis (people do not exist while dead) is\ntrue. On these assumptions, it is impossible for an event that occurs\nafter a person dies to be bad for her. It cannot be bad for her in\nitself and it cannot be overall bad for her either. To be overall bad\nfor a person, a posthumous event would have to make her have fewer\ngoods or more evils or both than she would have had if that event had\nnot occurred. But nothing that happens after a person dies and ceases\nto exist has any bearing on the amounts of pleasure or pain in her\nlife. Nothing that occurs after she ceases to exist modifies\nany of her intrinsic properties.\n\nAlthough the above assumptions rule out the possibility of posthumous\nharm, they are entirely consistent, we have seen, with the possibility\nof mortal harm, the possibility that people are harmed by dying. (We\nmight think otherwise if, as some theorists do, we assume that a\nperson no longer exists at the time she dies. Joel Feinberg 1984,\nfollowing Barbara Levenbook 1984, defined death as \u201cthe first\nmoment of the subject\u2019s nonexistence,\u201d which makes death\nsomething that occurs after a person has ceased to exist, and suggests\nthat by ruling out the possibility that a person is harmed by things\nthat occur after she ceases to exist we rule out the possibility of\nmortal harm.)\n6.2 Retroactive Harm\n\nThose who defend the possibility of posthumous harm deny that it\ninvolves backwards causation. But how could posthumous events affect\npeople if not via backwards causation?\n\nSome theorists say that posthumous harm occurs when posthumous events\nchange the value of a person\u2019s life for the worse. Dorothy\nGrover (1989) suggests that posthumous events may affect the\n\u201cquality\u201d of a person's life, say by changing the value of\nher accomplishments. David Velleman (1991) argues along similar lines,\nclaiming that later events may affect the meaning of earlier events,\nand the latter bears on the value of a person\u2019s life.\n\nSome theorists (for example, Pitcher 1984, Feinberg 1984, Luper 2004\nand 2012, and Scarre 2013) appeal to preferentialism to explain the\npossibility of posthumous harm. We noted earlier that preferentialists\ncan defend the idea that some events harm their victims retroactively,\nand that death is such an event. Preferentialists can take a similar\nstance on posthumous events, assuming that things that happen after we\ndie may determine whether desires we have while alive are fulfilled or\nthwarted.\n\nAccording to Pitcher, posthumous events harm us by being responsible\nfor truths that thwart our desires. For example, being slandered while\nI am dead makes it true that my reputation is to be damaged, and this\nharms me at all and only those times when I desire that my reputation\nbe untarnished. It is while I am alive that I care about my\nreputation\u2019s always being intact, and it is while I am alive\nthat my well-being is brought lower by posthumous slander. Similarly,\nmy desire that my child have a happy upbringing even if I am not there\nto provide it will be thwarted if, after I die, she catches some\ndevastating illness. The event that makes it true that my child will\nbe miserable occurs after I am gone, but this truth thwarts my desire\nabout my child now, so it is now that I am worse off. The posthumous\nevents themselves harm me only indirectly; directly I am harmed by\ntheir making things true that bear on my interests.\n\nHowever, the desire-based case for the possibility of posthumous harm\nremains controversial. It will be rejected by theorists who doubt that\npeople are harmed by events that do not modify their intrinsic\nfeatures, and by theorists who think that it hinges on the possibility\nof backwards causation, of course. Velleman (1991, p. 339) rejects the\ndesire-based case on the grounds that \u201cwe think of a person's\ncurrent well-being as a fact intrinsic to the present, not as a\nrelation that he currently bears to his future.\u201d Some theorists\necho a criticism that was offered by Partridge (1981, p. 246).\nConsider an event that thwarts one of a person's desires. To harm her\nby virtue of thwarting that desire, Partridge claims, the event must\noccur while she still has that desire, while she still cares\nabout whether it is fulfilled, but she and her desire are gone by the\ntime a posthumous event occurs. For some theorists (Vorobej, 1998,\nSuits 2001), the point is that we have no reason to care whether our\ndesires are fulfilled by events that occur once we no longer have\nthose desires, and we no longer have desires after we die. Parfit\nresisted this charge by noting that while some of our desires are\nconditional on their own persistence (we want them fulfilled at a time\nonly on condition that we will still have them at that time), others\nare not.\n7. Never Dying\n\nIs it always a misfortune for us to die? Would never dying instead be\nbad for us? In a pair of influential essays, Thomas Nagel defends an\naffirmative answer to the first question, while Bernard Williams\ndefends an affirmative answer to the second.\n7.1 Never Dying Would be Good\n\nIn \u201cDeath\u201d (and in The View From Nowhere, p. 224)\nNagel argues that no matter when it happens, dying is bad for those\nwho die. He bases this view on the claim that \u201clife is worth\nliving even when the bad elements of experience are plentiful and the\ngood ones too meager to outweigh the bad ones on their own. The\nadditional positive weight is supplied by experience itself, rather\nthan by any of its contents.\u201d (1970, p. 60) Nagel\u2019s view\nappears to be that it is intrinsically good for us to experience\nthings, and that this good is great enough to outweigh any evils that\naccompany it. Hence a person\u2019s welfare level is positive at any\ntime when she is experiencing things, and no matter how much misery\ncontinued existence will bring her, it is overall good for her to live\nlonger, assuming that she continues to experience things. (Nagel does\nnot argue that being deprived of continued life would be a misfortune\nif that life were entirely devoid of experience.)\n\nNagel considers objections to his view towards the end of his essay.\nOne might argue, Nagel points out (as noted earlier), that mortality\nis not a misfortune on the grounds that the nonrealization of remote\npossibilities (like being immortal) is not harmful, or on the grounds\nthat limitations that are normal to the species (like mortality) are\nnot harmful. He responds that the normality and inevitableness of\ndeath \u201cdo not imply that it would not be good to live\nlonger.\u201d Whenever death comes, it would have been good to live\nlonger, so it is bad for us that we will not: \u201cif there is no\nlimit to the amount of life that it would be good to have, then it may\nbe that a bad end is in store for us all.\u201d (1970, p. 69)\n\nNagel\u2019s case for saying that death is always bad for those who\ndie rests on his claim that the goodness of experiencing outweighs any\naccompanying evils. However, the latter is implausible, as is evident\nto anyone who would rather be sedated into unconsciousness than\nundergo the suffering she would otherwise experience during surgery.\nUnder such circumstances, sedation is overall good for us, despite the\nfact that (indeed: because) it stops us from experiencing things for a\ntime. And once this is acknowledged, it seems reasonable to add that,\nunder certain circumstances, dying would be overall good for us, and\nhence not bad for us after all. It would be overall good for us if the\nfurther life we otherwise would have would bring us great evils, such\nas suffering, that are not offset by goods.\n7.2 Never Dying Would be a Misfortune\n\nBernard Williams (and others, such as Shelly Kagan 2012) takes the\nview that it would be bad to live forever, even under the best of\ncircumstances. In his influential essay \u201cThe Makropulos Case:\nReflections on the Tedium of Immortality,\u201d Williams argues that\nalthough the deaths of some persons is a misfortune for them, never\ndying would be intolerable. In arguing for these views, Williams draws\nupon the notion of a categorical desire, which we can clarify as\nfollows.\n\nConsider a woman who wants to die. She might still take the view that\nif she is to live on, then she should be well fed and clothed. She\nwants food and clothing on condition she remain alive. In this sense\nher desires (for food and clothes) are conditional on her remaining\nalive, and, in being conditional on her living on, they do not give\nher reason to live. Contrast a father who desires that his beloved\ndaughter have a good start in life. His desire is not conditional on\nhis remaining alive. In this sense, it is, Williams says, categorical.\nIn fact, his desire gives him reason to live, because he can see to\nher well-being if he survives. Williams thinks that our categorical\ndesires are not only what motivate us to live on, they give meaning to\nour lives, and are important elements of our characters. He also\nthinks that it is by virtue of the fact that we will retain the same\ncharacter until a later time that it is clear to us that we will be\nthe same person until then.\n\nThe bearing on death, according to Williams, is, first, that we have\ngood reason to condemn a death that is premature in the sense that it\nthwarts our categorical desires. Second, mortality is good, for if we\nlive long enough, eventually we will lose our categorical desires. At\nthat point we will no longer be motivated to live on, and oppressive\nboredom will set in. When we contemplate this fate from our vantage\npoint in the present, we find it that it is not even clear to us that\nthese bored seniors are us.\n\nIf we could find a way to extend our lives indefinitely, yet avoid the\nravages of senescence, and remain healthy and mentally competent,\ncouldn\u2019t we avoid becoming jaded with life by gradually varying\nour interests over time, adding to and perhaps replacing some of our\ncategorical desires, again and again? Several theorists including\nNagel (1986, p. 224, n. 3), Glover (1977, p. 57), and Fischer (1994),\nhave argued that the lives of superseniors need not become dull and\ntedious. Williams\u2019s view is that it is not possible to make\neternal life desirable (which claim is not identical to the claim that\neternal life would inevitably be bad for us). Varying my categorical\ndesires will not work, because, to be desirable, the endless life I\ndesign for myself must meet two conditions: (1) \u201cit should\nclearly be me who lives forever,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe state in\nwhich I survive should be one that, to me looking forward, will be\nadequately related, in the life it presents, to those aims I now have\nin wanting to survive at all.\u201d (1973, p. 83) If I replace my\ncategorical desires, I fall afoul of at least one of these conditions.\nLife under the future desires is detached from life under my current\ncategorical desires. Moreover, the desires I give myself in the future\nwill be elements of a character that is very different from my current\ncharacter; replacing my current character with an entirely different\none later in life makes it far less clear, Williams appears to think,\nthat the individual living that later life is me. \u201cThe degree of\nidentification needed with the later life \u2026 is absolutely\nminimal.\u201d (1973, p. 85)\n\nWilliams\u2019s claim that immortality cannot be made desirable\nremains controversial. It is not obvious that eternal life is\nundesirable if it involves changing our categorical desires and\ncharacters (insofar as our characters are defined by the desires). Nor\nis it obvious that such changes must violate Williams\u2019s two\nconditions for the desirability of continued life. Williams seems to\nthink that the individual who is changed in this way will not clearly\nbe the same person as before, but he stops short of saying that it\nclearly will not be the same person (indeed, he defends a bodily\ncontinuity criterion for identity in \u201cThe Self and the\nFuture,\u201d pp. 46\u201363, so he presumably thinks that a person\ndoes survive changes of desires and character). Concerning\nWilliams\u2019s second condition, his view is that if we replace our\ncharacters and desires, \u201cthere is nothing left by which he can\njudge\u201d whether future life is desirable (1093, p. 85). Yet it\nseems reasonable to take the view now that it would be good for me to\ndevelop and fulfil desires in the future\u2014desires I now lack.\nMany of us would welcome the prospect of gradually transforming our\ninterests and projects over time. The gradual, continuous\ntransformation of our desires and projects does not end our lives, or\nexistence. It is distinct from, and preferable to, annihilation. If we\ncould live endlessly, the stages of our lives would display reduced\nconnectedness, yet remain continuous, which is a property that is\nimportant in the kind of survival most of us prize. Even after\ndrinking from the fountain of eternal youth, we would tend to focus on\nrelatively short stretches of our indefinitely extensive lives, being\nanimated by the specific projects and relationships we have then.\nHowever, sometimes we would turn our attention to long stretches of\nlife, and then, prizing continuity, we might well phase in new and\nworthwhile undertakings that build upon, and do not wholly replace,\nthe old. (For further discussion of the desirability of eternal life,\nsee Overall 2003, Bortolotti 2009, Smuts 2011, Luper 2012b, Altshuler\n2016, Buben 2016, Cholbi 2016, and Fischer 2019.)\n8. Can Death\u2019s Harmfulness be Reduced?\n\nEven if death is usually bad for those of us who die, perhaps it\nneed not be bad for us, if we prepare ourselves suitably.\nThis might be possible if some form of preferentialism is true, and\nif, by altering our desires, we could cease to have any interests that\ndying would impair. For then we might be able to thanatize\nour desires, in this sense: we might abandon all desires that death\nmight thwart. Among these are desires we can satisfy only if we live\non for a few days, but also desires we cannot possibly satisfy within\nthe span of a normal lifetime, and the desire for immortality itself.\nInstead of desiring that some project of mine succeed, which is a\ndesire that might be thwarted by my death, I might instead adopt a\nconditionalized version of this desire, namely: should I live on, let\nmy project succeed. If all goes well, thanatizing would insulate us\nfrom harm from death by leaving us with no interests with which dying\ninterferes.\n\nUnfortunately, this strategy will backfire. The main problem is that\ndeath can interfere with desire fulfillment not just by falsifying the\nobjects of our desires but also by precluding our having desires\n(Luper 2013). So even if we resolve, from now on, to limit ourselves\nto desires whose objects cannot be falsified by death, we are still\nvulnerable to the harm death will do us if it precludes our having and\nfulfilling desires. Hence thanatizing would force us to avoid having\nany desires whose fulfillment would have benefitted us, and to deny\nourselves such desires would be as bad for us as the harm we are\ntrying to avoid.\n\nHowever, the core idea of adapting our desires is useful, if not taken\nto an extreme. It is prudent to avoid taking on goals we cannot\npossibly attain, and hence prudent to eschew projects that cannot\npossibly be completed during the course of a normal lifetime.",
