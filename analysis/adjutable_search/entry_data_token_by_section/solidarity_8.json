    "main_text": "The Value of Solidarity\n3. The Value of Solidarity\n\nIt should be fairly uncontroversial that solidarity can have\ninstrumental value: when members of a marginalized group\ndevelop bonds of solidarity by committing to each other and, as a\nresult of being in (or acting from) solidarity, they manage to\novercome their oppression, then solidarity has value because of its\ncausal/instrumental role. Similarly, it should not be controversial\nthat solidarity can have instrumental disvalue: even well-meaning,\nmorally justified acts undertaken in the spirit of solidarity can lead\nto unforeseen and regrettable consequences. The more interesting and\nchallenging question is whether solidarity, as a social practice, also\nhas non-instrumental value (or disvalue). But before we move on to\nthis issue, let\u2019s briefly list some of the instrumental values\nthat solidarity in different forms typically facilitates:\n\nMost notably, solidarity improves a collective\u2019s ability to\npursue projects. By committing to each other and experiencing unity,\nfellows in solidarity establish a robust basis of mutual\nidentification that allows them to solve coordination issues and\npursue joint action that is more likely to succeed than if each acted\non their own (Shelby 2005). Groups that display solidarity also tend\nto care for each other in beneficial ways, e.g., by protecting\nvulnerable members or limiting social inequality amongst themselves\n(Banting & Kymlicka 2017; Miller 2017). Beyond this, solidarity\nhas certain epistemic and relational benefits: whether as a result of\nshared goals, shared experience, or shared oppression (see above),\nfellows in solidarity consider each other trustworthy participants in\nthe pursuit of the common good, and they share information, jointly\ndeliberate and learn from each other about how to understand adversity\nand oppression and pursue strategies to overcome it (Harvey 2007 on\nepistemic solidarity; Goodin & Spiekermann 2015; Wiland 2017).\n\n\nDoes solidarity have value beyond these good consequences? Perhaps\nsome quick terminology is helpful. Non-instrumental value is value\nthat does not derive from making a contribution to something else.\nNon-instrumental value is intrinsic if the value stems from\nsome (necessary?) internal property of the object (see: Intrinsic\nvs. Extrinsic Value). Implicitly relying on such a notion of\nintrinsic non-instrumental value, several authors have claimed that\nsolidarity\u2019s value could only ever be instrumental. Rainer\nForst, for example, argues that solidarity could not be\n\u201csomething intrinsically good, since a Mafia family\nvery much depends on the solidarity of its members\u201d\n(forthcoming) and he concludes that, therefore, solidarity is\n\u201cnormatively dependent\u201d. Other authors concur with this\njudgment: solidarity is aimed at realizing justice or\novercoming oppression, and it is valuable when and because it realizes\nthis aim (Kohn forthcoming). The structure of the negative argument\nhere is clear enough:\n\n If solidarity has non-instrumental value, then each\ninstance of it has value\n Unity amongst mafia members is an instance of\nsolidarity\n Unity amongst mafia members has no value\n Therefore, solidarity has no non-instrumental\nvalue.\n Therefore, no internal property of solidarity\npractices that is valuable as such, independent of the consequences\nthat it produces\n\n\nThere is, however, an interesting overlap here with an issue we\nmentioned in\n section 2,\n namely whether or not solidarity ought to be moralized: according to\nsome authors that analyze such \u201cpernicious solidarities\u201d\nas the one that prevails amongst mafia clans and white supremacists,\nthe correct response to Forst\u2019s case is not to reject\nthat the idea that solidarity has non-instrumental value, but to deny\n premise (2):\n it is precisely for the reason that solidarity necessarily has some\ngood-making internal properties that we should not consider unity\namongst mafia members an instance of it.\n\nIt is not obvious how to resolve this potential disagreement. Is there\nperhaps some other way to proceed? A better approach, we think, is\navailable if we scrutinize\n premise (1):\n Intrinsic value is just one way in which a practice could have\nnon-instrumental value. Whilst it may be true that a practice only has\nintrinsic value if each instance of it has value, this is compatible\nwith its being non-instrumentally valuable in non-intrinsic ways. Here\nare some important considerations: Only attributing instrumental value\nto solidarity does, intuitively, seem to run up against at least two\nkinds of cases. First, defenders of the non-instrumental value of\nsolidarity may point to the intuitive force of \u201cfutile\nsolidarity\u201d: when the exploited workers come together to fight\nfor their rights in solidarity, we are likely to consider this\nvaluable even if their effort is ultimately thwarted. Second,\nthere is the very plausible thought that, somehow, a special kind of\nvalue is realized when bad or unjust aspects of the world are brought\nto an end through acts of solidarity: when the workers\u2019 combined\nagency causes the end of their oppression rather than, say, the\nunexpected change of mind of their exploitative bosses, something\nespecially valuable has occurred.\n\nNow of course there are things that defenders of the\n\u201cinstrumental only\u201d thesis can say in response: for\nexample, they may point out that there still are good consequences in\neach of these examples, even if the overall goal has not been\nrealized. For example, there may be a sense of shared destiny or\nreciprocal commitment amongst workers to each other that is\ncaused by solidarity. It is this reciprocal commitment (and\nwhat it can lead to) that has value, not solidarity as such. The\nproblem with this response is that it seems to misdescribe the\nrelation between solidarity and whatever good has occurred in the\nworld. The reciprocal commitment that workers have towards each other,\nfor example, is not \u201ccaused\u201d by solidarity: rather,\nsolidarity is partly or wholly constituted by it. One\nsuggestion, then, is that solidarity has non-instrumental value of a\nnon-intrinsic kind. What does this mean? The idea is that solidarity\nis part-constitutive of something that is non-instrumentally valuable.\nThis allows for there to be some practice x that satisfies our\ncriteria for being solidaristic, and yet, it does not have value. But\nit preserves the idea that solidarity is not only good for what it\ncauses but, if the right circumstances obtain, it is an integral\nelement in something that is intrinsically good.\n\nThere are at least two ways in which we might flesh out\nsolidarity\u2019s non-instrumental value, one more individualistic\nand one more collective. The more individualistic approach suggests\nthat we can understand solidarity\u2019s non-instrumental value as\nanalogous to the value of other good dispositions and attitudes that\nan agent can have. Specifically, philosophers thinking about the\ngoodness of virtue have argued that appropriately responding to\nsomething that has value is itself something of (intrinsic) value, as\nis negatively responding to something that has disvalue (Hurka 2001).\nThe connection to virtue works as follows: when an agent responds to\nthe adversity that they or others face by developing solidaristic\nattitudes and dispositions\u2014say by committing to ending\noppression with others picked out by the cause\u2014then their having\nthese solidarist attitudes is non-instrumentally valuable because they\nare negatively reacting to something that is of disvalue (oppression,\nadversity etc.). But, and here is the rub, the agent\u2019s response\nis only valuable when it constitutes the correct\nresponse to the relevant feature of the world. The white\nsupremacist\u2019s solidarity is not valuable because the thing\nagainst which his solidarity is directed, namely racial equality, is a\nvaluable state of affairs. But negatively responding to something that\nhas value clearly lacks non-instrumental value. This individualist\naccount of solidarity\u2019s non-instrumental value is attractive\nbecause it can account equally well for cases of \u201csolidarity\namongst\u201d and \u201csolidarity with\u201d. Moreover, it equally\napplies to cases where agents privately develop the relevant\nsolidaristic attitudes without actually acting on them (e.g.,\ndiscussed in Bommarito 2016; Zhao 2019; and Viehoff forthcoming).\nInsofar as we think that their attitudes are valuable, some account\nalong these lines seems necessary to account for it.\n\nBut perhaps there is something missing from this individualistic\npicture: one of the objections to those suggesting that solidarity\nonly has instrumental value relied on the idea that there is value in\npeople realizing a goal together. Shouldn\u2019t our account\nof solidarity\u2019s non-instrumental value also be able to capture\nthis aspect? Recent literature has accounted for this in broadly two\nways (though these are not necessarily exclusive): Avery Kolers\nmaintains that, quite independently of pursuing justified aims,\nsolidarity groups constitute just (in his words\n\u201cequitable\u201d) relations amongst participants. For Kolers,\nin following the demands of solidarity and acting together, \n\n\nwe are not only working to (teleologically) bring about the end of\noppression; rather, we constitutively embody a non-oppressive\nalternative world\u2014even if, as is likely, our joint efforts\nultimately fail, in part or in whole. (Kolers 2016: 123\u20134) \n\n\nSo one way of highlighting non-instrumental collective value ensues\nfrom focusing on the kind of community that relations of solidarity\ngive rise to: in acting together in the specific way required by the\nideal of solidarity, fellows already conform to norms of equity or\njustice that they seek to bring about more widely.\n\nAnother line of argument is developed by Sangiovanni, who argues that,\nwhen successfully pursuing valuable goals together, we create\nnon-instrumentally valuable joint agency: \n\n\nWe take pleasure in the exercise of those reciprocal, mutually\nadjusted, and mutually reinforcing capabilities that have enabled us\nto overcome forms of adversity that would have been impossible to\novercome alone. The collective activity of overcoming [\u2026] comes\nto have non-instrumental value. (Sangiovanni forthcoming) \n\n\nHowever, and similar to the more individualistic argument, the value\nof jointly exercised agency is conditional: acting\nsuccessfully to overcome some obstacle is non-instrumentally valuable\nonly if the overcoming constitutes an achievement that is\nworthwhile.\n",
