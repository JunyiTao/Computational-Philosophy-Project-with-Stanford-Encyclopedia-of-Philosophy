    "main_text": "Ontology\n3. Ontology\n\nRamsey is famous for his denial of the particular-universal\ndistinction. But his ontological vision was even more radical and\naustere than this suggests because Ramsey also denied the existence of\ncomplex entities, including complex universals, facts and\npropositions. Ramsey\u2019s main arguments for this austere ontology\nappear in his two landmark papers \u201cUniversals\u201d (1925b) and\n\u201cFacts and Propositions\u201d (1927a). At a general level we\ncan think of Ramsey as endeavoring to bring our views of ontology\nclear of the shadows of words (MacBride 2005a, 2018 chapter 10).\n\nAt this point in his intellectual development, the mid-1920s, Ramsey\nwas developing the insights he found in Russell and Wittgenstein. But\nRamsey not only took many of their ideas to a new level of detail and\nsophistication but pushed boundaries by showing that they had not gone\nfar enough. \u201cUniversals\u201d provides a luminous example of\nRamsey pushing against boundaries that had held Russell back.\nAccording to Russell, \u201cThe influence of language on philosophy\nhas, I believe, been profound and almost unrecognized. If we are not\nto be misled by this influence it is necessary to become conscious of\nit and to ask how far it is legitimate\u201d (Russell 1924, 330).\nRussell was specifically concerned that the subject-predicate form\ncommon to Indo-European languages had misled Western philosophers,\nconditioning them to take for granted a substance-attribute ontology\nwhilst being blind to the existence of relations. Russell proposed to\nremedy the situation by introducing alongside the category of\nparticulars, a broader category of universals which subsumed both\n(monadic) attributes and (polyadic) relations. But, in\n\u201cUniversals\u201d, Ramsey argued that Russell had not gone far\nenough, because the particular-universal distinction itself was just a\nfurther shadow cast by language. Ramsey wrote, \u201cnearly all\nphilosophers, including Mr Russell himself have been misled by\nlanguage in a far more far-reaching way than that\u201d, i.e. more\nfar-reaching than being led merely to deny the existence of relations,\nbecause \u201cthe whole theory of particulars and universals is due\nto mistaking for a fundamental characteristic of reality, what is\nmerely a characteristic of language\u201d (1925b, 405). But Ramsey\nwasn\u2019t aiming to replace the particular-universal distinction\nwith an alternative distinction of his own. Instead he aimed to\ninculcate in his reader a studied indifference, which meant\nwithholding judgment, at least a priori, about the forms or categories\nof atomic objects, as Wittgenstein had done in the\nTractatus.\n\nRamsey diagnosed that Russell had been led astray by supposing the\nsubject-predicate distinction to be a logical distinction. So Ramsey\ndevoted \u201cUniversals\u201d to arguing it isn\u2019t logical.\nRamsey recognised there wasn\u2019t just one candidate for being the\nsubject-predicate distinction. So \u201cUniversals\u201d is divided\ninto an examination of several candidates. Ramsey argued they reflect\nmerely accidental features of our language or subjective needs or\nbiased interests, so none of them provide a basis for an objective\nclassification of what there is.\n\nRamsey begins \u2018Universals\u2019 with what was to became a\ncelebrated argument of early analytic philosophy (see Sahlin 1990,\n192\u2013202 and Simons 1991 for helpful accounts of Ramsey\u2019s\nmain lines of argument in \u201cUniversals\u201d). To persuade us\nthere are serious issues to engage here, Ramsey compared\n\n(3.1)  Socrates is\nwise.\n\nand,\n\n(3.2)  Wisdom is a\ncharacteristic of Socrates.\n\n\nWhilst they are different sentences, Ramsey invites us to agree that\nthey say the same about what\u2019s out there even though they differ\nin their surface forms. He reflected, \u2018Now of one these\nsentences \u2018Socrates\u2019 is the subject, of the other\n\u2018wisdom\u2019; and so which of the two is subject, which\npredicate, depends upon what particular sentence we use to express our\nproposition, and so had nothing to do with the logical nature of\nSocrates or wisdom, but is a matter entirely for language\u2019\n(1925b, 404). Ramsey hypothesises that the subject-predicate\ndistinction isn\u2019t a semantic or representational distinction at\nall, hence not in the business of marking a division of things, but\nrather a distinction which we employ to communicate to conversational\npartners the focus of our discussion: \u201cIf the centre of our\ninterest is Socrates we say \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019, if we are\ndiscussing wisdom we may say \u2018wisdom is a characteristic of\nSocrates\u2019; but whichever we say we mean the same\nthing\u201d.\n\nRamsey\u2019s aim was not to conclusively establish this hypothesis\non the basis that (3.1) and (3.2) are used to make the same\nassertion\u2013as indeed many of his critics have supposed. What they\nmiss is that to be fit for purpose, Ramsey\u2019s argument only had\nto be strong enough to make us seriously entertain the possibility\nthat the subject-predicate distinction doesn\u2019t serve a\nrepresentational function, because that\u2019s enough to throw doubt\nupon the procedure of classifying things on the basis of the\nsubject-predicate distinction, hence strong enough to make it evident\nthat \u201cthe question requires a new examination\u201d (1925b,\n405).\n\n(Anscombe [1959, 108], Geach [1950, 474\u20135; 1975, 143\u20134]\nand Dummett [1973, 63\u20134] have all criticised Ramsey\u2019s\nargument here on the grounds that whilst a predicate may be negated a\nname may not \u2013 although see Anscombe\u2019s\n\u2018Retractation\u2019 [1965]. Coming from a different direction,\nSimons [1991, 159], Dokic and Engel [2002, 40\u20131] and Lowe [2004,\n307] argue that Ramsey was mistaken to think that ontological issues\ncould ever be settled in logico-linguistic terms. MacBride [2005a,b]\nargues that the former criticisms miss their intended mark because\nRamsey was committed to denying that negative predicates correspond to\nthe constituents of atomic facts; whereas the latter criticisms miss\ntheir mark because Ramsey was in fact arguing that logical reflection\nfails to determine the nature of the atomic facts. Hochberg [2004,\n197\u20139], Mulligan [2000], Simons [1992, 151\u20132] raise\nfurther difficulties for Ramsey\u2019s initial argument that builds\nupon the equivalence of (3.1) and (3.2) but MacBride [2018,\n207\u201310] argues that these criticisms rest upon a failure to\nappreciate the radical character of Ramsey\u2019s challenge.)\n\nRamsey begins his new examination by considering whether molecular\nstatements can be analysed into subjects and predicates \u2013\nspecifically predicates which stand for complex universals. He argues,\nreductio ad absurdum, that they don\u2019t. He assumes that\nif two analyses of a proposition invoke different constituents then\nthey are analyses of different propositions. Absurdity results when\nthis assumption is combined with the claim that complex predicates are\nterms for complex universals. This is because more than one complex\npredicate may be isolated in a sentence of the form\n\u2018aRb\u2019 \u2013 predicates that may be represented\nby \u2018xRb\u2019, \u2018aRy\u2019\nand\u2018xRy\u2019. If these predicates are terms for\ndifferent universals, then the sentence \u2018aRb\u2019\nexpresses no less than three propositions. The propositions are\ndistinct because they correspond to the three different collections of\nconstituents: (i) xRb, a, (ii) aRx,\nb, and (iii) xRy, a, b. But this\nis absurd because \u2018aRb\u2019 says only one thing: that\naRb. Ramey concluded, \u201cso the theory of complex\nuniversals is responsible for an incomprehensible trinity, as\nsenseless as that of theology\u201d (1925b, 406). Ramsey must also\nhave thought but doesn\u2019t spell out, that it\u2019s a\nconsequence of this argument that complex particulars should be\ndismissed too \u2013 otherwise particulars would be distinguished\nfrom universals in terms of complexity. (For discussion of\nRamsey\u2019s argument against complex universals see Oliver 1992;\nMellor 1992; and MacBride 2005a, 86\u201394; 2018,\n210\u2013220.)\n\nRamsey next looks to see if a logical distinction between subject and\npredicate applies to atomic statements. Russell had argued that\npredicates can be distinguished from subjects by the fact that the\nformer exhibit a distinctive incompleteness because they carry the\nform of the statements in which occur. Ramsey agreed that it\u2019s\nnatural to feel that an adjective like \u2018wise\u2019 is\nincomplete in a manner that \u2018Socrates\u2019 is not. But, Ramsey\nargued, predicates only appear to be especially incomplete because as\nordinary language users we overlook relevant data: we routinely\ndistinguish wide from narrow scope occurrences of predicates but we\ndon\u2019t do the same for subjects even though the same distinction\ncan be drawn for them. Ramsey cites Russell\u2019s theory of\ndescriptions as the inspiration for the wide-narrow scope distinction,\nwhich Ramsey elaborates in terms of a distinction between more and\nless encompassing ranges of propositions in which an expression\nfigures. Ramsey concludes that to be a substantive (or adjective)\n\u201cis not an objective but a subjective property, in the sense\nthat it depends not indeed on any one mind but on the common elements\nin all men\u2019s minds and purposes\u201d (1925b, 413).\n\nSince the difference between \u2018Socrates\u2019 and\n\u2018wise\u2019 turns out to be subjective in this way, it tells us\nnothing about the objective classification of the constituents of\natomic facts. Moreover, Ramsey continued, once we are explicit about\nthe wide and narrow scope occurrences of atomic expressions, there is\nno reason to think that any of them are especially incomplete. Ramsey\nheld that it is only the \u2018biassed interest\u2019 of\nmathematicians, i.e. their extensionalism, that make things appear\notherwise (1925b, 416). They neglect to distinguish between complex\npredicates which really do require variables for their depiction\n(\\(xRa \\lor xSb\\)) and atomic expressions which don\u2019t\n(\u2018\\(f\\)\u2019 in \u2018\\(fa\\)\u2019), because they are only\ninterested in the extensional matter whether these expressions are\ntrue or false of the same things. But to avoid \u2018useless\ncomplication\u2019 mathematicians treat the latter terms as requiring\nvariables for their representation too (\u2018\\(fx\\)\u2019), hence\nproducing the appearance that there is some class of atomic terms\nwhich are incomplete because they require variables (1925b,\n414\u20135). But, Ramsey continued, if it were not for the biased\ninterests of the mathematician, we would allow \u2018\\(f\\)\u2019 to\nstand alone, so removing the appearance of an especially incomplete\nclass of atomic terms.\n\nHaving completed his examination, Ramsey concluded that we can know\nnothing whatever about the classification of the constituents of\natomic facts. But when he came to reprise his argument a year later in\n\u201cUniversals and \u2018the Method of Analysis\u2019\u201d\n(1926b), Ramsey adopted the more modest conclusion that whilst we\ncannot know a priori the forms of the atomic facts we may yet\nknow them a posteriori: \u201cWhen I wrote my article I was\nsure that it was impossible to discover atomic propositions by actual\nanalysis. Of this I am now very doubtful, and I cannot be sure that\nthey may not be discovered to be all of one or another of a series of\nforms which can be expressed by \\(R_1(x)\\), \\(R_2(x,y)\\),\n\\(R_3(x,y,z)\\)\u2026. This I admit may be found to be the case, but\nno one can as yet be certain what atomic propositions there are, it\ncannot be positively asserted; and there is no strong presumption in\nits favour, for I think that the argument of my article establishes\nthat nothing of the sort can be known a priori\u201d (1926b,\n31) (see Methven 2018 for discussion of the relationship between\nRamsey 1925b and 1926b).\n\nRamsey\u2019s less well-known arguments against the ontology of facts\nand propositions appear in the context of Ramsey\u2019s discussion of\nthe nature of truth and belief. In \u201cFacts and\nPropositions\u201d (1927a) he argued against the existence of facts\non the grounds that the expression \u2018the fact that\u2026\u2019\ncannot be completed to make either a name or a description of a fact\n(1927a, 155\u20137). Indeed, he claimed, \u2018the fact\nthat\u2026\u2019 disappears upon paraphrase of the contexts in\nwhich it occurs. As Ramsey put the point (1927a, 159):\n\n(3.3)  the fact that\n\\(a\\) has \\(R\\) to \\(b\\) exists \n\n\nis no different from\n\n(3.4)  \\(a\\) has \\(R\\)\nto \\(b\\)\n\n\nBy \u2018is no different from\u2019 (his words) Ramsey meant\nsomething like \u201csemantically equivalent\u201d. So his argument\nis that (3.3) is just a long-winded way of saying (3.4) and because\n(3.4) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact, it follows\nthat (3.3) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact\neither.\n\nWe can imagine Ramsey unpacking this argument further. Statements like\n(3.3) commit us to the existence of facts if any statements do; they\nconstitute our best effort to explicitly affirm the existence of\nfacts. Since even statements like (3.3) don\u2019t commit us to\nfacts, because they\u2019re just paraphrases of statements like\n(3.4), we cannot have reason to believe in the existence of facts at\nall. To transpose a remark of Ramsey\u2019s from another context, if\nyou can\u2019t say that facts exist, you can\u2019t whistle it\neither. We could call this Ramsey\u2019s \u2018redundancy theory of\nfacts\u2019, emphasising another parallel, this time with his famous\nredundancy theory of truth (according to which \u2018\\(a\\) has \\)(R\\)\nto \\(b\\) is true\u2019 says the same as \u2018\\(a\\) has \\(R\\) to\n\\(b\\)\u2019).\n\nRamsey renounced propositions conceived as the single objects of\njudgment, which may be true or false, for the reasons that had already\nled Russell to give up propositions so conceived, namely \u2018the\nincredibility of the existence of objects as \u201cthat Caesar died\nin his bed\u201d which could be described as objective falsehoods,\nand the mysterious nature of the difference, on this theory, between\ntruth and falsehood\u2019 (1927a, 153\u20134). Ramsey, like Russell,\ndidn\u2019t spell this out, but we can think of Ramsey as pointing,\ninter alia, to the difficulty of explaining the unity of a\nproposition \\(aRb\\) in terms of \\(R\\)\u2019s holdings between \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\), which is difficult to understand if the proposition is\nfalse since then \\(R\\) doesn\u2019t hold between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nRamsey continued to find objective falsehoods incredible in his later\nmanuscript \u2018On Truth\u2019: \u2018it is only the hardiest\nverbalists who can persuade themselves \u2018that the earth is\nflat\u2019 is the name of something real\u2019 ([OT] 85).\n\nRamsey concluded with Russell, \u2018that a judgment had no single\nobject, but is a multiple relation of the mind or mental factors to\nmany objects, those, namely, which we should ordinarily call\nconstituents of the propositions judged\u2019 (1927a, 154). So we can\nthink of Ramsey offering two arguments for renouncing propositions\nconceived as single objects: a negative argument, that they\u2019re\nincredible and mysterious, but also a positive argument arguing that\npropositions so conceived are dispensable based upon Ramsey\u2019s\nown views about truth and belief which don\u2019t require them. In\n\u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 Ramsey put forward a version of\nWittgenstein\u2019s picture theory according to which a subject\n\u2018will believe that \\(aRb\\) by having names for \\(a\\), \\(R\\), and\n\\(b\\) connected in his mind and accompanied by a feeling of\nbelief\u2019 (1927a, 160) but Ramsey was already pushing in more\nradical, pragmatist direction which emphasised the significance of\naction for understanding the notion of belief, hence shifting\nattention further away from an ontology of facts and propositions.\n(See the section on Belief and Truth.)\n\nIt is Ramsey\u2019s ontological views on the particular-universal\ndistinction that have attracted the most attention. On the historical\nfront, Ruth Barcan Marcus (1993) argues that Ramsey\u2019s\n\u201cUniversals\u201d bore a significant influence on\nRussell\u2019s subsequent intellectual development; see MacBride 2004\nand Hochberg 2004 for further discussion. MacBride (2018) puts\nRamsey\u2019s \u201cUniversals\u201d in historical context, arguing\nthat \u201cUniversals\u201d should be interpreted as the final stage\nin an extended conversation about particulars and universals,\ninvolving G.E. Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and Whitehead. Misak\n(2020) explores the connection between \u201cUniversals\u201d and\nRamsey\u2019s later pragmatist writings. Braithwaite (1926) and\nStrawson (1959, chapter 5) argued, contra Ramsey, that the\nparticular-universal distinction may be understood in spatio-temporal\nterms. See MacBride 2005c and Lowe 2006 (chapter 7) for further\ndiscussion of Ramsey\u2019s views on universals from a contemporary\npoint of view.\n",
