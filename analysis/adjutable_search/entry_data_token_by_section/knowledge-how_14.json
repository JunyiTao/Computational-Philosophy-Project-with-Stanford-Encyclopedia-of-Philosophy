    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Knowledge-How || Knowledge-How and Gettier\n6.2 Knowledge-How and Gettier\n\nAnother way of challenging the intellectualist claim that\nknowledge-how is a species of knowledge-that is to question whether\nknowledge-how can be Gettiered. If knowledge-how survives\nGettierization, that would be evidence that knowledge-how is not a\nspecies of knowledge-that, on the assumption that Gettiered justified\ntrue belief cannot constitute propositional knowledge (Gettier 1963).\nStanley & Williamson (2001) argue that knowledge-how cannot be\nGettiered. However, Cath (2011) responds by proposing the\nLucky Light Bulb case, where Charlie wants to learn\nhow to change a lightbulb, but he knows almost nothing about light\nfixtures or bulbs. Charlie consults The Idiot\u2019s Guide to\nEveryday Jobs. Inside, he finds an accurate set of instructions\ndescribing the shape of a light fixture and bulb, and the way to\nchange a bulb. Charlie grasps these instructions perfectly. And so\nthere is a way such that Charlie now believes truly that that way is a\nway for him to change a light bulb, namely, the way described in the\nbook. However, unbeknownst to Charlie, he is extremely lucky to have\nread these instructions, for the disgruntled author of The\nIdiot\u2019s Guide filled her book with otherwise misleading\ninstructions. Cath (2011) argues that intuitively Charlie still knows\nhow to fix the light bulb, despite his belief being Gettiered (cf.\nalso Poston 2009: 744).\n\nStanley replies that knowledge-wh in general seems to be\nGettierable and that might be explained in terms of features having to\ndo with knowing the answer. For example, consider\nHawthorne\u2019s (2000) example of a teacher giving each child in\ntheir class a note with the name of a city. \u201cVienna\u201d is\nwritten only on one of the notes. In this context, it seems true that\none child knows the correct answer to the question \u201cwhat is the\ncapital of Austria\u201d, even though the child\u2019s belief is\ntrue by luck. (Though see Carter & Pritchard 2015c for a reply\nthat while knowledge-how is similar to knowledge-that and knowledge-wh\nin that it is incompatible with intervening luck, it differs with\nthese kinds of knowledge in being compatible with environmental luck.)\nOthers still have responded that intuitions are subtle and not all of\nthem favor anti-intellectualism (Marley-Payne 2016; Pavese\nforthcoming-a). For a recent experimental study with mixed results,\nsee Carter, Pritchard, and Shepherd (2019). Hawley (2003: 28) argues\nthat knowledge-how, like propositional knowledge, requires\n\u201cwarrant\u201d on the ground that success on the basis of a\nlucky guess does not seem to manifest one\u2019s knowledge-how. A\nsimilar theoretical argument for thinking that lucky belief cannot\nsuffice for knowledge-how starts from the thesis that knowledge-how\nenters in explanations of success and that satisfactory explanations\nmust be \u201cmodally robust\u201d. From this, the argument\nconcludes that the sort of belief that robustly explains intentional\nsuccess must be knowledge, for knowledge has the relevant modal\nprofile (Sosa 1999; Williamson 2000; D. Greco 2016). Another line of\nargument starts from the observations that knowledge-how to \u03a6\nexplains the ability to intentionally \u03a6 (see\n section 4)\n and that only knowledge can explain intentional action (Gibbons 2001:\n589\u2013590). On these bases, some argue that knowledge-how cannot\nfall short of non-getteriable knowledge (Cath 2015b for objections to\nthis line of argument).\n",
