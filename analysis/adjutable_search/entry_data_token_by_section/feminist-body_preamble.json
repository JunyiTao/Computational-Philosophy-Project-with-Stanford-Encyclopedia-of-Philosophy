    "main_text": "\n\nFor much of the history of western philosophy the body has been\nconceptualized as simply one biological object among others, part of a\nbiological nature, which our rational faculties set us apart from, as\nwell as an instrument to be directed, and a possible source of\ndisruption to be controlled. Problematically, for feminists, the\nopposition between mind and body has also been correlated with an\nopposition between male and female, with the female regarded as\nenmeshed in her bodily existence in a way that makes attainment of\nrationality questionable. \u201cWomen are somehow more\nbiological, more corporeal, and more natural than\nmen\u201d (Grosz 1994: 14). Such enmeshment in corporeality was also\nattributed to colonized bodies and those attributed to the lower\nclasses (McClintock 1995, Alcoff 2006). Challenging such assumptions\nrequires feminists to confront corporeality in order to elucidate and\nconfront constructions of sexed difference. The accounts of the\nrelationship between subjectivity, corporeality and identity which\nhave thereby been developed have implications for other aspects of our\ncorporeal existence. Feminist theorists are therefore in active\nconversation with critical race theorists (Alcoff, Ahmed, Crenshaw,\nFanon, hooks, Hill Collins, Gilman, Gooding-Williams, Tate), theorists\nof (dis)ability (Clare, Inahara, Garland-Thomson, Mairs, McRuer,\nShildrick, Thomas, Toombs Wendell), and theorists exploring gender\ndiversity (Bettcher, Lane, More and Whittle, Prosser, Salamon, S. Stone).\n",
