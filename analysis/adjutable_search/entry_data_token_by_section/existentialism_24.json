    "main_text": "Contemporary Relevance || Critical Phenomenology\n7.4 Critical Phenomenology\n\nThe attentiveness to conditions of oppression, subjugation, and\nviolence among postwar existentialists in France has had a decisive\nimpact on recent developments in critical phenomenology by giving voice\nto those who have been historically marginalized or undervalued in the\nwestern tradition. Beauvoir\u2019s pioneering account of the\nwoman\u2019s experience in The Second Sex is well known for\nlaying the conceptual foundations for second wave feminism, and her\nlate career phenomenology of aging broke new ground by shedding light\non the existence of older persons and exposing the toxic ageism in\ncontemporary capitalist societies. Together with Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty, her ideas would inform Franz Fanon\u2019s Black\nSkin, White Masks (1952 [1967]), a seminal work that disclosed the\ndehumanizing experience of colonized Black populations and helped give\nbirth to Africana critical theory or \u201cblack existentialism\u201d\n(Gordon 2000). The focus on the ways in which structures of\ndiscrimination along with the limits of our own embodiment can\nconstrain our capacities for freedom and transcendence has, in turn,\ninfluenced recent phenomenological accounts of intersectionality and\nthe lived experience of, among others, indigenous peoples, immigrants,\nand exiles (Coulthard 2014; Ortega 2016), queer and trans identities\n(Ahmed 2006; Salamon 2010), those who are imprisoned or in solitary\nconfinement (Guenther 2013; Leder 2016), and the elderly, disabled, and\nchronically ill (Aho 2022; Reynolds 2022; Dickel 2022).\n",
