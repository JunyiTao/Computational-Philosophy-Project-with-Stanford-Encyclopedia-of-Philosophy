    "main_text": "Transcendental Ethics || Politics and contemplation\n5.4 Politics and contemplation\n\nAlmost all the details that we know of Philo\u2019s life are in\nrelation to his political activity. Though he himself has a clear\npreference for theoretical and mystical life, he played an important\nrole in the Jewish community of Alexandria. This is one of the great\nparadoxes of his life. He thought that it was necessary to engage in\npolitical affairs before attempting the contemplative life, but the\ntragic situation of the Alexandrine community obliged him to commit to\npublic life in order to defend his coreligionists. Nevertheless, he\nnever considered politics a field without interest. His treatises are\nfull of remarks about the origin of society, or about the functioning\nof human society. Stasis, violent sedition in the city, was\none of his main concerns, certainly based on his own experience. He\nwas perfectly aware of the Stoic doctrine of the social\noikei\u00f4sis, which affirmed that the whole of mankind was\na natural community, arranged in concentric circles (family, nation,\nhumankind as a whole). He did not deny the existence of kinship among\nhuman beings, even if \u201cmalignant covetousness\u201d is always a\nsource of hatred. He tried to give a concrete shape to the natural\nlink by encouraging philanthropy and demanding humane treatment of\nslaves. He did not hesitate in advocating their emancipation. He even\nasserts that their emancipation \u201cgranted freedom to him who is\nnaturally free\u201d (Spec. 2.84). At the same time, he\ndescribes mankind as being deeply divided by passions, wars, and all\nkinds of violence. He has the same optimistic vision of human nature,\nat least in principle, as the Stoics, while he also adopted the\npessimistic view of the Neo-Academic Carneades in his critique of\nStoicism. One of his most original ideas to transcend this duality was\nthat individual political regimes were \u201cadditions to the one\nnatural regime\u201d (Ios. 28\u201331). The dispersion of\nhumanity and the strength of the passions have as consequence that\nharmonious coexistence of nations, though theoretically possible, is\nin reality impossible. Because there is, in politics, a permanent\nantagonism between individual passions and natural reason, the figure\nof the politician is himself varied and contradictory. Moses is not a\npolitician, but at once the figure of the philosopher-king, the sage,\nthe priest, and the prophet. Even before receiving the Law, he is the\nincarnation of the law (nomos empsychos), as were the\npatriarchs (Abr. 3\u20135). Joseph, the best politician, is\nnot a constant object of Philo\u2019s admiration. Even though a\nrecent paper (Frazier 2002) tried to give evidence of a greater\ncoherence between the two treatises, in the De Iosepho Joseph\nis described as a responsible and courageous man, while in the De\nsomniis he is said to be mainly desperate for glory. For Philo,\nmonotheism would imply the superiority of monarchy, but with the\nexception of Moses, most human beings are too weak and inconsistent to\nensure stable monarchy. In fact, his political thought is profoundly\ninfluenced by the Hellenistic idea of anacycl\u00f4sis, the\nnatural instability of the three elementary constitutions (monarchy,\naristocracy, and democracy). The Greek historian Polybius had thought\nthat a mixed constitution would be the guarantee against this\ninstability, and he saw in the Roman constitution the paradigm of this\nstability. In a certain sense, for Philo, the city of Moses is the\nmodel of a new kind of constitution: it associates transcendence with\nlaw of nature, particularism and universalism, monarchy, aristocracy\nand democracy. Was it for him, as it said by Carlier (2008: 433)\n\u201cun mod\u00e8le concurrentiel \u00e0 la civitas\nromana\u201d (i.e., a competitive model to Rome)? Certainly it\nwas for him a model of a different kind, a radically different kind of\nexemplarity. In this perspective, the famous and controversial passage\nabout the Essenians (Probus 75\u201392) can be read as the\ndemonstration that this model was not a utopian one.\n\nFor Cicero, who has many common points with Philo despite fundamental\ndifferences, the problem of the choice of life (theoretical,\npolitical, or mixed) is one of the most frequent themes of his\nphilosophical reflection. For him, it was essentially a matter of\npersonal choice. In the case of Philo, as it was underlined by Calabi\n(2011, 2013: 87), the commandment to observe the Sabbath establishes a\nstructural organization of time, which must include at least a part of\ntheoretical life. Philo stresses the fact that in all the Jewish\ncommunities Sabbath was a day for praying and also for devoting\noneself to philosophy (Spec. 2.62), that is, the study of the\nTorah. Does the De uita contemplativa, with its long\ndescription of the life of the Therapeuts of Alexandria, mean that the\ntheoretical life was for Philo the best kind of life, or only a\nphilosopher\u2019s dream? There are many declarations of Philo\nasserting the superiority of the theoretical life. At the same time,\nhe does not imagine this life as an isolated one. To live in the\ndesert does not necessarily mean to live alone. In fact, the desert is\nthe place where the double aspect of virtue appears most clearly,\nwhich is reflection and action at the same time. This duality is once\nagain a common point between Philo and the Stoics, but also an element\nof difference, because no Stoic showed the slightest interest for kind\nof life of the Therapeuts.\n",
