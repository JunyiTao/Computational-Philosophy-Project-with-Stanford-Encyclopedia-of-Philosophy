    "main_text": "Social-Political Philosophy\n2. Social-Political Philosophy\n\nAlways writing from the left, Weil continually revised her\nsocial-political philosophy in light of the rapidly changing material\nconditions in which she lived. However, she was consistent in her\nacute attention to and theorizing from the situation of the oppressed\nand marginalized in society.\n\nHer early essays on politics, a number of which were posthumously\ncollected by Albert Camus in Oppression et libert\u00e9\n(OL), include \u201cCapital and the Worker\u201d (1932),\n\u201cProspects: Are We Heading for the Proletarian\nRevolution?\u201d (1933), \u201cReflections concerning Technology,\nNational Socialism, the U.S.S.R., and certain other matters\u201d\n(1933) and, most importantly, \u201cReflections concerning the Causes\nof Liberty and Social Oppression\u201d (1934 in OL 36\u2013117). In\nher early writings, Weil attempted to provide an analysis of the real\ncauses of oppression so as to inform militants in revolutionary\naction. Her concern was that, without this analysis, a socially\nenticing movement would lead only to superficial changes in the\nappearance of the means of production, not to new and freer forms of\nstructural organization.\n\nThe division of labor or the existence of material privilege alone is\nnot a sufficient condition for Weil\u2019s concept of\n\u201coppression\u201d. That is, she recognized that there are some\nforms of social relations involving deference, hierarchy, and order\nthat are not necessarily oppressive. However, the intervention of the\nstruggle for power\u2014which she, following Hobbes, sees as an\ninexorable feature of human society\u2014generates oppression.\n\n\n[P]ower [puissance] contains a sort of fatality which weighs\nas pitilessly on those who command as on those who obey; nay more, it\nis in so far as it enslaves the former that, through their agency, it\npresses down upon the latter (\u201cReflections concerning the Causes\nof Liberty and Social Oppression\u201d, OL 62).\n\n\nOppression, then, is a specific social organization that, as a\nconsequence of the essentially unstable struggle for power, and\nprincipally the structure of labor, limits the individual from\nexperiencing the world to the full extent of her or his full\ncapability, a capability Weil describes as \u201cmethodical\nthinking\u201d (p\u00e9nsee m\u00e9thodique). By\ndivorcing the understanding from the application of a method,\noppression, exercised through force, denies human beings direct\ncontact with reality. Also informing her sense of oppression is her\nnotion of \u201cprivilege\u201d, which includes not only money or\narms, but also a corpus of knowledge closed to the working masses\nthat, thereby, engenders a culture of specialists. Privilege thus\nexacerbates oppression in modern societies, which are held together\nnot by shared goals, meaningful relations, or organically developing\ncommunities, but through a \u201creligion of power\u201d (OL 69). In\nthis way, both power and prestige contribute to a modern reversal of\nmeans and ends. That is, elements like money, technology, and\nwar\u2014all properly speaking \u201cmeans\u201d\u2014are, through\nthe workings of power, treated as \u201cends\u201d worthy of\nfurtherance, enhancement, and multiplication without limit.\n\nIn her early social-political thought Weil testified to what she\ncalled \u201ca new species of oppression\u201d\n(\u201cProspects\u201d, OL 9), namely, the bureaucracy of modern\nindustry. Both her anarchism and Marxian method of analysis influenced\nhow she problematized revolutionary struggle: the problem lies in\nforming a social organization that does not engender bureaucracy, an\nanonymous and institutionalized manifestation of force. The\noppressiveness of modern bureaucracy, to which she responded through\nanalysis and critique, includes clich\u00e9d, official and\nobscurantist language\u2014the \u201ccaste privileges\u201d of\nintellectuals (\u201cTechnology, National Socialism, the\nU.S.S.R\u201d, OL 34)\u2014 and a division of labor such that, in\nthe case of most workers, labor does not involve, but in fact\nprecludes, engaged thinking. Out of balance in this way, modern humans\nlive as cogs in a machine: less like thinking individuals, and more\nlike instruments crushed by \u201ccollectivities\u201d.\nCollectivity\u2014a concept that centrally comprises industry,\nbureaucracy, and the state (the \u201cbureaucratic organization\npar excellence\u201d [OL 109]), but that also includes\npolitical parties, churches, and unions\u2014by definition quashes\nindividual subjectivity.\n\nDespite her critiques of oppression, prestige, and collectivity, in a\npolemical argument Weil is also critical of \u201crevolution\u201d,\nwhich for her refers to an inversion of forces, the victory of the\nweak over the powerful. This, she says, is \u201cthe equivalent of a\nbalance whose lighter scale were to go down\u201d (OL 74).\n\u201cRevolution\u201d in its colloquial or deterministic sense,\nthen, has itself become an \u201copiate\u201d, a word for which the\nlaboring masses die, but which lies empty. For Weil, real revolution\nis precisely the re-organization of labor such that it subordinates\nthe laborers neither to management (as in bureaucracy) nor to\noppressive conditions (as in factory work). As she sees it, if\nrevolution is to have meaning, it is only as a regulative, and not a\npositive, ideal (OL 53). In Weil\u2019s adaptation of this Kantian\nnotion, such a regulative ideal involves an attention to reality,\ne.g., to the present political and working conditions, to human\nconditions such as the struggle for power. Only in this way can it\nprovide a standard of analysis for action: the ideal allows for a\ndialectical relation between a revolutionary alternative and present\npraxis, which is always grounded in material conditions. Freedom,\nthen, is a unity of thought and action. It is, moreover\u2014and not\nunlike in Hegel\u2019s conceptualization\u2014a condition of\nbalanced relations to and interdependence with others (who check our\nsovereignty) and the world (which is limited and limiting). A freeing\nmode of production, as opposed to an alienating and oppressing one,\nwould involve a meaningful relation to thinking and to others\nthroughout the course of labor. When workers understand both the\nmechanical procedures and the efforts of other members of the\ncollectivity, the collectivity itself becomes subject to individuals,\ni.e., means and ends are rightfully in a relation of equilibrium.\n\nThe ontology behind Weil\u2019s notion of free labor draws on the\nKantian emphasis on the individual as an end\u2014especially, for\nWeil, in her or his capacity for thinking (with Plato, for whom\nknowing and doing are united). In addition, the teleology of labor in\nWeil\u2019s philosophy corresponds with the thought of Hegel and\nMarx, and is in opposition to Locke: in the individual\u2019s mixing\nwith the material world, her interest lies in how this promotes\nliberty, rather than property. The uprooting Weil experienced in\nfactory work introduced a shift in her conception of freedom: as she\nbegan to see the human condition as not just one of inexorable\nstruggle, but of slavery, her notion of freedom shifted from a\nnegative freedom from constraints to a positive freedom to obey. She\nreferred to the latter, a particular kind of relational freedom, as\n\u201cconsent\u201d. She concluded her \u201cinventory of modern\ncivilization\u201d (OL 116) with a call to introduce play into the\nbureaucratic machine and a call to think as individuals, denying the\n\u201csocial idol\u201d by \u201crefusing to subordinate\none\u2019s own destiny to the course of history\u201d and by taking\nup \u201ccritical analysis\u201d (OL 117). In sum, by 1934 Weil\npictured an ideal society, which she conceptualized as a regulative\nimpossibility in which manual labor, understood and performed by\nthinking individuals, was a \u201cpivot\u201d toward liberty.\n\nWeil\u2019s \u201cFactory Journal\u201d from 1934\u20131935\nsuggests a broader shift in her social-political philosophy. During\nthis period, her political pessimism deepened. In light of the\nhumiliating work she conducted in the factories, her post-factory\nwritings feature a terminological intensification: from\n\u201chumiliation\u201d and \u201coppression\u201d to\n\u201caffliction\u201d (malheur), a concept informed by her\nfactory experience of embodied pain combined with psychological agony\nand social degradation\u2014and to which she would later add\nspiritual distress.\n\nIn 1936 Weil advanced her political commitments in ways that\nforeshadowed her later social-political thought. She continued to\neschew revolution and instead to work toward reform, namely, greater\nequality in the factory through a shift from a structure of\nsubordination to one of collaboration. In addition, in response to the\noutbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she argued against fascism while\nfavoring\u2014against the Communist position\u2014French\nnon-intervention. She was opposed to authoritarian logic, and she saw\ngoing to war as a kind of surrender to the logic of power and prestige\ninherent in fascism.\n\n\nOne must choose between prestige and peace. And whether one claims to\nbelieve in the fatherland, democracy, or revolution, the policy of\nprestige means war. (1936 \u201cDo We Have to Grease Our Combat\nBoots\u201d, FW 258)\n\n\nWeil\u2019s development of the concepts of power and prestige\ncontinued in her article \u201cLet Us Not Start Another Trojan\nWar\u201d (1936, subtitled, and translated into English as,\n\u201cThe Power of Words\u201d in SWA 238\u2013258). Her thesis is\nthat a war\u2019s destruction is inversely proportional to the\nofficial pretexts given for fighting it. Wars are absurd, she argued\n(against Clausewitz), because \u201cthey are conflicts with no\ndefinable objective\u201d (SWA 239). Like the phantom of Helen\nthat inspired ten years of fighting, ideologies (e.g., capitalism,\nsocialism, fascism), as well as capitalized words such as\n\u201cNation\u201d and \u201cState\u201d, have taken on the role\nof the phantom in the modern world. Power relies on\nprestige\u2014itself illusory and without limit because no nation\nthinks it has enough or is sure of maintaining its imagined glory, and\ntherefore ever increases its means to wage war\u2014so as to appear\nabsolute and invincible. In response to these forces, Weil prescribed\ndistinguishing between the imaginary and the real and, relatedly,\ndefining words properly and precisely. Taken together, these\nprescriptions amount to a critique of ideology with its bloated\npolitical rhetoric.\n\n\n[W]hen a word is properly defined it loses its capital letter and can\nno longer serve either as a banner or as a hostile slogan; it becomes\nsimply a sign, helping us to grasp some concrete reality or concrete\nobjective, or method of activity. To clarify thought, to discredit the\nintrinsically meaningless words, and to define the use of others by\nprecise analysis\u2014to do this, strange though it may appear, might\nbe a way of saving human lives. (SWA 242)\n\n\nFurther, Weil desired a kind of equilibrium between forces instead of\nan endless pursuit of an illusion of absolute stability and security.\nFollowing Heraclitus, she saw struggle as a condition of life. What is\nrequired of the thinking individual, in turn, is to distinguish\nbetween worthwhile conflict, such as class struggle, and illusions of\nprestige, which often serve as the foundation of war. In her middle\nperiod, then, Weil maintained the contrariety between reality, limit,\nand equilibrium on the one hand and imagination, limitlessness, and\ncollectivity on the other. In her 1937 \u201cNote on Social\nDemocracy\u201d, she defined politics as follows:\n\n\nThe material of the political art is the double perspective, ever\nshifting between the real conditions of social equilibrium and the\nmovements of collective imagination. Collective imagination, whether\nof mass meetings or of meetings in evening dress, is never correctly\nrelated to the really decisive factors of a given social situation; it\nis always beside the point, or ahead of it, or behind it. (SE 152)\n\n\nIn her late period Weil provided an explication of the all-pervasive\nand indiscriminate concept of \u201cforce\u201d in the essay\n\u201cThe Iliad or the Poem of Force\u201d (1940 in SWA\n182\u2013215). It is important to note Weil\u2019s locus of\nenunciation for this concept, temporally after the fall of France and\nspatially from a position of exile, including antisemitic\nmarginalization, which is why the essay appeared in the December 1940\nand January 1941 Cahiers du Sud under the anagrammatic\npseudonym Emile Novis, taken up by Weil to avoid antisemitic\nconfrontation and censorship. This essay was not only the most widely\nread of Weil\u2019s pieces during her lifetime, but it was also her\nfirst essay to appear in English, translated by Mary McCarthy and\npublished in Dwight Macdonald\u2019s magazine Politics in\n1945 (November, pp. 321\u2013330).\n\nIn her essay on the Iliad\u2014a text Roberto Esposito calls\n\u201ca phenomenology of force\u201d (Esposito 1996 [2017:\n46])\u2014Weil further develops an understanding of force initially\npresented in her earlier, unfinished essay \u201cReflections on\nBarbarism\u201d (1939): \u201cI believe that the concept of force\nmust be made central in any attempt to think clearly about human\nrelations\u201d (quoted in P\u00e9trement 1973 [1976: 361]). The\nprotagonist of the Iliad, Weil writes in an original reading,\nis not Achilles or Hector, but force itself. Like her concept of\n\u201cpower\u201d in her early writings, \u201cforce\u201d reifies\nand dehumanizes no matter if one wields or undergoes it. Further,\nforce includes not only coercion, but also prestige, which is to say\nthat it has a social element. Two important implications follow.\nFirst, on the level of the individual, each \u201cpersonality\u201d\n(la personne) is informed by social values and thereby\nfeatures the operations of force through accidental characteristics,\nsuch as the name of the family into which one is born or the embodied\nfeatures that are considered physically attractive at a certain place,\nin a certain society, at a certain time. Second, on the level of the\ncollectivity, force can destroy not only bodies, but also values and\ncultures, as is the case, Weil is at pains to point out, in French\ncolonialism. In her mid-to-late writings, then, she saw neither\nMarx\u2019s notion of class nor Hegel\u2019s self-development of\nGeist, but force itself, as the key to history. She presents\nthis concept as \u201cthe force that kills\u201d and as a specific\nkind of violence \u201cthat does not kill just yet\u201d, though\n\n\n[i]t will surely kill, it will possibly kill, or perhaps it merely\nhangs, poised and ready, over the head of the creature it can\nkill, at any moment, which is to say at every moment. (SWA\n184\u2013185)\n\n\nWeil\u2019s concept of force, then, is also a development from Hobbes\nand Hegel: it names that which renders the individual a slave.\n\nIt was in London (1942\u20131943), during her work for the Free\nFrench, that Weil articulated her most robust late social-political\nphilosophy. Her concepts of \u201clabor\u201d and\n\u201cjustice\u201d thickened as she moved further toward\nChristianity and\u2014against her early emphasis on the\nindividual\u2014toward the social. Weil\u2019s pi\u00e8ces\nd\u2019occasion from this time period include \u201cDraft for a\nStatement of Human Obligations\u201d (1943), written in response to\nde Gaulle\u2019s State Reform Commission in its drafting of a new\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, as well as \u201cNote\non the General Suppression of Political Parties\u201d (1943), written\nbecause the Free French was considering recognizing political parties.\nIn this piece Weil argues for the complete abolition of political\nparties. Drawing on Rousseau\u2019s concept of the general will, Weil\ncontends that political parties subdue the independent, individual\nwills of which the general will is derivative and on which democracy\ndepends. Most important from this period was her major work The\nNeed for Roots (L\u2019enracinement), which Weil called\nher second \u201cmagnum opus\u201d (SL 186), and which Albert Camus\npublished posthumously in 1949, with Gallimard, as the first of 11\nvolumes of Weil\u2019s he would promote.\n\nWeil wrote additional essays in London, the most conceptually\nimportant of which was \u201cLa Personne et le\nsacr\u00e9\u201d (1942\u20131943, translated into English as\n\u201cHuman Personality\u201d), in which she critiques\n\u201crights\u201d as reliant on force and poses as counter-terms\n\u201cobligation\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d. She distinguishes\nbetween two conceptions of justice: natural (hence social and\ncontingent) and supernatural (hence impersonal and eternal). The\nNeed for Roots (1943 NR) adds \u201cneeds of the soul\u201d as\nanother counter-balance to rights. Overall, Weil presents not a\nlaw-based or rights-based, but a compassion-based morality, involving\nobligations to another that are discernible through attention,\ncentered on and evolving toward a supernatural justice that is not of\nthe world, but that can be in it. As a departure from Kant, and\nthrough Plato, whom Weil \u201ccame to feel\u2026 was a\nmystic\u201d (\u201cSpiritual Autobiography\u201d, WFG 28), the\nbasis of her sense of (supernatural) justice was not human\nrationality, but a desire for the Good, which she believed all humans\nshare, even if at times they forget or deny this. Importantly, given\nher critique of French colonialism, and despite her claim that\nobligations to another must be indiscriminate, i.e., universal, she\ndid not want to universalize law in a Kantian fashion. Rather, her aim\nwas for cultures to continue their own traditions, for the goal of\nrootedness (l\u2019enracinement) is not to change cultural\nvalues per se, but more precisely, to change how individuals\nin those cultures read and orient themselves toward those values.\n\nWeil\u2019s concept of \u201croots\u201d is crucial to her late\npolitical thought. With connotations of both vitality and\nvulnerability, \u201croots\u201d conceptualizes human society as\ndynamic and living while attesting to the necessity of stability and\nsecurity if growth and flourishing are to occur on the level of the\nindividual. Beyond the organic metaphor on the level of the natural,\nher concept of roots serves as a kind of bridge between the reality of\nsociety and the ideal of supernatural justice. Roots do this by\nmanifesting human subjection to material and historical conditions,\nincluding the need to participate in the life of a community, to feel\na sense of connection to a place, and to maintain temporal links,\ne.g., to cultural history and to hopes for the future. In turn, a\nrooted community allows for the development of the individual with a\nview toward God or eternal values. As such, and contra her\nearly and middle maintenance of a critical distance from any\ncollectivity (or Great Beast, to use the Platonic metaphor she\nfrequently employs), in her late thought Weil sees roots as allowing\nfor a \u201cnew patriotism\u201d based on compassion. The\nestablishing of roots (l\u2019enracinement) enables multiple\nrelations to the world (e.g., on the level of the nation, the\norganically developing community, the school) that at once nourish the\nindividual and the community.\n\nIn addition to war and colonization, in The Need for Roots\nWeil points to money and to contemporary education as\nself-perpetuating forces that uproot human life. The longest section\nof the text describes modern uprootedness\n(d\u00e9racinement), occurring when the imagined modern\nnation and money are the only binding forces in society, and she\ncharacterizes this condition as a threat to the human soul. Modern\neducation is corrupted both by capitalism\u2014such that it is\nnothing except \u201ca machine for producing diplomas, in other\nwords, jobs\u201d (NR 118)\u2014and by a Roman inheritance for\ncultivating prestige with respect to the nation: \u201cIt is this\nidolatry of self which they have bequeathed to us in the form of\npatriotism\u201d (NR 137). As an alternative to modern uprootedness,\nWeil outlines a civilization based not on force, which turns a person\ninto a thing, but on free labor, which in its engagement with and\nconsent to necessary forces at play in the world, including time and\ndeath, allows for direct contact with reality. Moreover, Weil\u2019s\nwriting in The Need for Roots is refracted through her\nreligious experience. In this later period, then, she no longer\nconceptualizes labor in the mechanical terms of a \u201cpivot\u201d\nas she did in her early writings; it is now the \u201cspiritual\ncore\u201d of \u201ca well-ordered social life\u201d (NR 295). (In\nher late social-political philosophy, in fact, a spiritual revolution\nis more important than an economic one.) Contra the Greeks,\nwho devalued physical work, her conception of labor serves to mediate\nbetween the natural and the supernatural. In her late writings, labor\nis fully inflected by her experiences with Christianity. As such,\nlabor\u2019s consent to and, moreover, working through natural forces\n(e.g., gravity) is in fact consent to God, who created the natural\nworld. Labor\u2019s kenotic activity, as energy is expended daily, is\na kind of imitatio Christi.\n\nHer social-political writings in London are markedly different from\nher early writings as an anarchist informed principally by Descartes,\nMarx, and Kant. While those influences remain, her later writings must\nbe read through the lens of her Christian Platonism. She suggests that\nwe must draw our spiritual life from our social environment. That is,\nwhile spirituality is individual vis-\u00e0-vis God, this\nspirituality occurs within a social context, namely, the collectivity,\nand principally, the nation. This is a reversal from the critical\ndistance she had maintained from the collectivity, especially in her\nearly emphasis on the individual\u2019s methodical thinking.\n",
