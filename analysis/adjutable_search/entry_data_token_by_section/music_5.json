    "main_text": "Music and the Emotions\n3. Music and the Emotions\n\nThe most widely discussed philosophical question concerning music and\nthe emotions is that of how music can express emotions. (For a more\nextensive introduction, see part II of Gracyk & Kania 2011; for a\nthorough treatment, see S. Davies 1994.) There is a second group of\nquestions centered around listeners\u2019 emotional responses to\nmusic. These include questions about why and how we respond\nemotionally to music, the value of such responses, and why we choose\nto listen to music that elicits \u201cnegative\u201d responses from\nus, such as sadness. Theorists typically restrict themselves to\n\u201cpure\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d music on the grounds that\nit is easier to understand how music with an accompanying text, say,\ncould express the emotions evident in the text. However, an important\ncriterion for the evaluation of such music is how appropriately the\ncomposer has set her chosen text to music. So an accompanying text is\nclearly not sufficient for the musical expression of an emotion. Thus,\na better reason for initially putting such music to one side is\nperhaps that the interrelation of music and text, or other elements,\nis likely to be highly complex, and best approached with as\nwell-developed a theory of the more basic phenomena in hand as\npossible. (For an extended criticism of this approach, see Ridley\n2004: 1\u2013104.)\n",
