    "main_text": "The Origins of Syllogistic Arts\n3. The Origins of Syllogistic Arts\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s tale of the origins of language runs\non into a tale of how language makes it possible to handle concepts in\nnew ways. For al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b one key difference between\nlanguage and concepts is that language is public and allows\ncommunication between people. Hence many of the new uses of concepts\nhave to do with social interaction. In each case he is interested in\nthe development of new skills for handling concepts. Skills involve\ninstruments and rules for handling these instruments; so the\nappearance of a new skill involves an acceptance of the rules\n(qaw\u0101n\u012bn, singular q\u0101n\u016bn) for\nhandling its instruments. A bundle of associated skills and their\nrules is called an \u201cart\u201d\n(\u1e63in\u0101\u2018a). \n\nThe first new art that he calls attention to is rhetoric\n(khi\u1e6d\u0101ba), the art of the orator, which uses\nconcepts in order to persuade people to do or believe certain things.\nThe main users of this skill are political and religious leaders, who\nemploy it in order to assert their authority. Alongside rhetoric\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b mentions the art of poetry\n(shi\u2018r), which uses concepts in order to bring people\nto certain states of mind. He sees this art as most useful for\nreligious leaders. He also mentions an art which he calls the art of\nsophistry. This art embodies the skill of producing bad arguments from\nfalse premises. It\u2019s hard to see what could have led him to the\nconclusion that there is such an art, beyond the fact that the\nAlexandrian syllabus contained, wedged between a book on dialectical\nmethods and one on rhetorical methods, Aristotle\u2019s treatise\nSophistical Refutations. Aristotle\u2019s treatise is\nusually understood to be teaching the art of detecting and refuting\nbad arguments, not that of creating them! \n\nOne effect of the introduction of language is that people are able to\nlearn the opinions of other people. They will inevitably discover that\nsome people disagree with them, not least in speculations about the\nnature of the universe. So the art of dialectics or debate\n(jadal) is introduced in order to resolve differences of\nopinion between two people. ([Letters] (140,141)\n150.2\u2013151.7.) But a dialectical resolution of a disagreement is\nno guarantee of the truth of the agreed conclusion; one of the\ndebaters might just be better at arguing ([Debate]\n40.9\u201313). \n\nA realization that dialectics doesn\u2019t lead to certain truth will\ninspire some individuals to seek other methods that do. At this point\nthe community discovers the art of \u201cdemonstration\u201d\n(burh\u0101n), which establishes truths with certainty.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b believes that among the Greeks this art was\nachieved by Plato:\n\n\nPlato was the first to be aware of the demonstrative methods and to\ndistinguish them from the dialectical, sophistical, rhetorical, and\npoetical methods. But from his point of view they were distinguished\nin use and according to matter, and in terms of what guidance he\nreceived from his considerations at leisure and his superior natural\nintelligence. He didn\u2019t prescribe universal rules for them.\nAfterwards Aristotle did prescribe such rules in his book\nPosterior Analytics. ([Rhetoric] 55.13\u201317)\n\n\nIt was a commonplace in the Neoplatonic schools that the high point of\nlogic was Posterior Analytics with its treatment of knowledge\nwith certainty. The Neoplatonists also considered that Aristotle had\narranged his Organon so that the path up to this summit\nthrough Categories, De Interpretatione, and\nPrior Analytics assembled the tools of logic, and the\ndownward slope from Posterior Analytics onwards allowed the\nstudent to apply these tools within demonstrative methods, dialectical\nmethods, sophistical methods, rhetorical methods, and poetic methods\nin turn. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b inherited this view of Aristotle;\nsee [Aristotle] pp. 82\u201393.\n\nHe also inherited the zeal of the Neoplatonic schools to catalogue the\ningredients of logic. Thus in [Letters] he catalogued the\nlogical arts according to the social needs that brought them into\nexistence, while in [Aristotle] he catalogued them according\nto the books of the Organon that Aristotle devoted to them.\nThese two principles of classification led to essentially the same\ndivisions between logical arts. But sometimes he used principles that\ndraw distinctions in different places. For example in\n[Syllogism] he classified kinds of logic by the syllogisms\n(i.e. two-premise inferences) that they used; we come to this\nclassification in Section 6 below. Elsewhere he classified kinds of\nlogic by the kinds of premise that they accepted in their syllogisms.\n\n\nAll the kinds of logic, even the less syllogistic kinds, must have\nrules about what to adopt as starting premises. In the case of\nrhetoric, practicality implies that the orator should choose premises\nthat the audience will accept; likewise in dialectics it makes sense\nto start with premises that have some plausibility.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b believes that in practice the community will\ninsist on restrictions that add a note of objectivity: for example,\nthat experts agree to the premise, or that nobody positively disagrees\nwith it. He formulates some conditions along these lines, including\nthat the premises must be at least \u201cstandard\u201d\n(massh\u016br) or \u201creceived\u201d\n(maqb\u016bl). (For discussion of such conditions and where\nthey apply, see Aouad 1992 and Black 1990: Chapter 5A. Chatti 2017\nreviews how al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b catalogues the starting points of\ninferences in hypothetical logic. Kleven 2023 studies the treatment of\nthe starting points of reasoning in some of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s introductory essays, and adds some\ninteresting information about the manuscripts.)\n\nRhetorical reasoning might be the hardest to make sense of,\nparticularly when [Letters] suggests that the rhetorician\u2019s\njob is done when he or she has persuaded the audience. Surely that aim\ncould be achieved by means that don\u2019t involve logic at all? But\nrecently it has come to be accepted that the Latin essay\n[Didascalia] published in [Rhetoric] is probably a\ntranslation of the prologue to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s lost\nLong Commentary on Rhetoric. In fact the work goes way beyond\nvague remarks about methods of persuasion; see Woerther 2020. For\nexample al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b observes that medical reasoning about\nwhat remedies to apply to this present invalid, and agricultural\nreasoning about how to increase the yield of this particular field,\ncannot be demonstrative since they apply only to this particular\nindividual (invalid or field); so we have to take them as rhetorical\nreasoning (Woerther (2020 p. 346)). On this reckoning, much of the\nreasoning of our most respected experts must count as rhetoric. \n\nIn sections 23 and 24 towards the end of Prior Analytics ii,\nAristotle discusses argument by induction and argument by analogy,\nwith a view to showing that both of them are reducible to syllogism.\nSince [Syllogism] is an epitome of Prior Analytics,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b closes the book with some sections in which\nhe gives his own reductions of induction and analogy to syllogism.\nSome manuscripts of [Syllogism], and some manuscripts of the\nlater work [Short\n Syllogism],[10]\n include a pair of essays which we will refer to as the Tailpiece; the\nfirst essay is on the logical device of \u201ctransfer\u201d, and\nthe second is on the application of this device to reduce arguments in\nIslamic jurisprudence (fiqh) to syllogisms. In the first of\nthese two essays al-Farabi refers to a number of named argument forms\n(for example \u201ctransfer from the observed to the\nunobserved\u201d), and it is clear that he is referring to earlier\ndebates about these argument forms; but there is no agreement on\nwhether the debates were in Roman Empire medical circles or in Islamic\ntheology. \n\nOne particular strand in this complex is a distinction that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b makes between two forms of analogy, which he\ndescribes as ta\u1e25l\u012bl and tark\u012bb\nrespectively. Some authors have read these words as\n\u201canalysis\u201d and \u201csynthesis\u201d respectively, and\ntried to read these as descriptions of two different kinds of formal\nproof. But this is certainly wrong, since the distinction that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b himself draws between the two kinds of\nargument is not about the form of the resulting proof, but about the\ncriteria for success in the search for a middle term.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b himself is a little conflicted at this point;\nin loyalty to Aristotle he wants to emphasise the reduction to\nsyllogism, but the point he makes about search, which is central for\nhis application to fiqh in the second essay, is not about the\nform of the final syllogistic proof at all. (See Chatti and Hodges\n2020 for further details on the Tailpiece, and Hodges 2020 for the\nincreasing interest in search algorithms in this\n period.)[11]\n\nFurther remarks comparing al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s dialectics with\nIslamic fiqh can be found in Gyekye (1989) and Young (2017:\n539\u2013543).\n",
