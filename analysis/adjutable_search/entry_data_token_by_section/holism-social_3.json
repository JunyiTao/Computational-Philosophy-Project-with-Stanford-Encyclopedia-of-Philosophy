The\nargument begins by observing that holist explanations contain social\ndescriptions or concepts, and goes on to note that the meaning of\nsocial descriptions cannot be captured by specifications that contain\ndescriptions of individuals alone. Or, put otherwise, social concepts\nare not reductively definable solely in terms of individualist\nconcepts. As a result, it is impossible to translate holist\nexplanations into individualist ones: holist explanations cannot be\nreplaced by individualist explanations through translation. Finally,\nthe argument concludes that since the events accounted for by holist\nexplanations should not go unexplained holist explanations are\nindispensable.\n\nThe argument from the impossibility of translation is famously\npresented by Maurice Mandelbaum in a paper from 1955 (Mandelbaum\n1955). Here Mandelbaum defines social concepts as concepts that refer\nto forms of organization within a society. He remarks that concepts of\nthis sort \u201ccannot be translated into psychological [i.e.,\nindividualist] concepts without remainder\u201d (1955:\n310\u2014italics in the original). In order to drive this point home,\nMandelbaum considers the social concept of a bank teller. In order to\nspecify what a bank teller is, it is necessary to invoke the social\nconcept of a bank. The definition of a \u201cbank\u201d, in turn,\nmust contain social concepts such as \u201clegal tender\u201d and\n\u201ccontract\u201d. And these social concepts, too, can only be\ndefined in ways that involve yet other social concepts, such that the\ndefinition of a social concept inevitably contains other social\nconcepts. Given that the distinctive feature of holist explanations is\ntheir very containment of social concepts, these explanations can thus\nnot be translated into, and as such replaced by, individualist\nexplanations.\n\nMandelbaum\u2019s argument, including his example of the bank teller,\nis widely cited in subsequent contributions to the debate between\nmoderate methodological holists and individualists (see e.g., Bhargava\n1992; Danto 1973 [1962]; Epstein 2015; Gellner 1973 [1956]; Goldstein\n1973b [1958]; James 1984; Kincaid 1986, 1997; Zahle 2003). However,\nfew moderate methodological holists have followed Mandelbaum in\nholding that holist explanations are indispensable if they indeed\ncannot be translated into individualist explanations.\n",
