    "main_text": "Theodicies || Free Will\n7.2 Free Will\n\nA second important approach to theodicy involves the following ideas:\nfirst, that libertarian free will is of great value; secondly, that\nbecause it is part of the definition of libertarian free will that an\naction that is free in that sense cannot be caused by anything\noutside of the agent, not even God can cause a person to freely do\nwhat is right; and thirdly, that because of the great value of\nlibertarian free will, it is better that God create a world in which\nagents possess libertarian free will, even though they may misuse it,\nand do what is wrong, than that God create a world where agents lack\nlibertarian free will.\n\nOne problem with an appeal to libertarian free will is that no\nsatisfactory account of the concept of libertarian free will is yet\navailable.  Thus, while the requirement that, in order to be free in\nthe libertarian sense, an action not have any cause that lies outside\nthe agent is unproblematic, this is obviously not a sufficient\ncondition, since this condition would be satisfied if the behavior in\nquestion were caused by random events within the agent. So one needs\nto add that the agent is, in some sense, the cause of the action. But\nhow is the causation in question to be understood? Present accounts\nof the metaphysics of causation typically treat causes as states of\naffairs. If, however, one adopts such an approach, then it seems that\nall that one has when an action is freely done, in the libertarian\nsense, is that there is some uncaused mental state of the agent that\ncausally gives rise to the relevant behavior, and why freedom, thus\nunderstood, should be thought valuable, is far from clear.\n The alternative is to shift from event-causation to what is\nreferred to as \u2018agent-causation\u2019. But then the question is\nwhether there is any satisfactory account of causation where causation\nis not a relation between states of affairs. Some philosophers, such\nas Timothy O\u2019Connor (1995, 1996, 2000a, 2000b, and 2002) and Randolph\nClarke (1993, 1996, and 2003) have claimed that such an account can be\ngiven, but their suggestions have not been widely accepted. \n\nBut even if the difficulty concerning the nature of libertarian free\nwill is set aside, there are still very strong objections to the\nfree-will approach. First, and most important, the fact that\nlibertarian free will is valuable does not entail that one should\nnever intervene in the exercise of libertarian free will. Indeed,\nvery few people think that one should not intervene to prevent\nsomeone from committing rape or murder. On the contrary, almost\neveryone would hold that a failure to prevent heinously evil actions\nwhen one can do so would be seriously wrong.\n\nSecondly, the proposition that libertarian free will is valuable does\nnot entail that it is a good thing for people to have the power to\ninflict great harm upon others. So individuals could, for example,\nhave libertarian free will, but not have the power to torture and\nmurder others.\n\nThirdly, many evils are caused by natural processes, such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes, and other weather conditions, and by a wide\nvariety of diseases.  Such evils certainly do not appear to result\nfrom morally wrong actions.  If that is right, then an appeal to free\nwill provides no answer to an argument from evil that focuses upon\nsuch evils.\n Some writers, such as C. S. Lewis and Alvin Plantinga, have\nsuggested that such evils may ultimately be due to the immoral actions\nof supernatural beings (Lewis, 1957, 122\u20133; Plantinga, 1974a, 58). If\nthat were so, then the first two objections mentioned above would\napply: one would have many more cases where individuals were being\ngiven the power\u2014much greater than the power that any human\nhas\u2014to inflict great harm on others, and then were being allowed\nby God to use that power to perform horrendously evil actions leading\nto enormous suffering and many deaths. In addition, however, it can\nplausibly be argued that, though it is possible that earthquakes,\nhurricanes, cancer, and the predation of animals are all caused by\nmalevolent supernatural beings, the probability that this is so is\nextremely low.\n",
