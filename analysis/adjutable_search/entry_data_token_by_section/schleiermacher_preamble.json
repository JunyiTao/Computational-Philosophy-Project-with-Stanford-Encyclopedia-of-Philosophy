    "main_text": "\n\nFriedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (1768\u20131834) perhaps cannot\nbe counted as one of the very greatest German philosophers of the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries (like Kant, Herder, Hegel, Marx,\nor Nietzsche). But he is certainly one of the best second-tier\nphilosophers of the period (a period in which even the second-tier was\nstill extremely good). He was not only a philosopher, but also an\neminent classical scholar and theologian. Much of his philosophical\nwork was in the philosophy of religion, but from a modern\nphilosophical point of view it is his hermeneutics (i.e., theory of\ninterpretation) and his theory of translation that deserve the most\nattention. This article will attempt to provide a fairly broad\noverview of his philosophical thought. One thing that will emerge from\nthis is that while he has important philosophical debts to many\npredecessors and contemporaries (including Spinoza, Kant, and\nFriedrich Schlegel), he was above all following in the philosophical\nfootsteps of one predecessor in particular: Herder.\n",
