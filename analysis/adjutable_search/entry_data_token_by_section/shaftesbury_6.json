    "main_text": "Morality || Motivation, egoism, and hedonism\n2.3 Motivation, egoism, and hedonism\n\nThroughout his works, Shaftesbury attacks a view of human motivation\nthat he associates with Hobbesian and voluntarism. Some commentators\nhave thought that the view of human motivation Shaftesbury advances in\nthese anti-Hobbesian and anti-voluntarist passages is ardently\nnon-egoistic\u2014i.e., that Shaftesbury believes that human agents\ncan be motivated by considerations other than self-interest (Den Uyl\n1998; Schneewind 1998; Irwin 2008; Carey 2006). Other commentators\nhave argued that Shaftesbury himself holds an egoist view of human\nmotivation\u2014that he thinks every human\u2019s actions are\nmotivated by self-interested desires\u2014and that his attacks on\nHobbes and the voluntarists are directed only at what he takes to be\nan incorrect view of self-interest (Sidgwick 1902; Peach 1958;\nTrianosky 1998; Grote 2010; Crisp 2019, 78). Still other commentators\nhave claimed that Shaftesbury is inconsistent, opposing egoist views\nof human motivation in some passages and assuming them in other\npassages (Martineau 1886: 508; Wiley 1940: 74).\n\nThose who interpret Shaftesbury as an anti-egoist point to passages in\nwhich he argues that theories that rely exclusively on selfish\nmotivation cannot explain plainly observable human behavior. In\nWit and Humour, Shaftesbury attacks those who\n\n\nwou\u2019d new-frame the human Heart; and \u2026 reduce all its\nMotions, Balances and Weights, to that one Principle and Foundation of\na cool and deliberate Selfishness. (C 1.116)\n\n\nIn fact, Shaftesbury argues, careful observation reveals that humans\nare motivated by many non-selfish considerations.\n\n\n[W]hoever looks narrowly into the Affairs of it, will find, that\nPassion, Humour, Caprice, Zeal,\nFaction, and a thousand other Springs, which are counter to\nSelf-Interest, have as considerable a part in the Movements\nof this Machine. There are more Wheels and Counter-Poises in\nthis Engine than are easily imagin\u2019d. \u2019Tis of too complex\na kind, to fall under one simple View, or be explain\u2019d thus\nbriefly in a word or two. The Studiers of this Mechanism must\nhave a very partial Eye, to overlook all other Motions besides\n[selfishness]. (C 1.115)\n\n\nPeople exhibit non-selfish \u201cCivility, Hospitality, Humanity\ntowards Strangers or People in distress\u201d (C 1.118). Their\nconcern for\n\n\nRelations, Friends, Countrymen,\nLaws, Politick Constitutions, the Beauty of\nOrder and Government, and the Interest of Society and\nMankind \u2026 naturally raise a stronger Affection\nthan any which was grounded upon the narrow bottom of mere Self.\n(C 1.117)\n\n\nIndeed, even those tendencies that are most destructive are usually\nbased in sociable, non-selfish concerns. War and social disruption are\nusually caused not by selfishness but by a powerful concern for party\nor clan. It is love and fellowship for those in one\u2019s group that\nlead to widespread conflict, not self-love.\n\n\nIn short, the very Spirit of Faction, for the greatest part,\nseems to be no other than the Abuse or Irregularity of that social\nLove, and common Affection, which is natural to Mankind.\nFor the Opposite of Sociableness is Selfishness. And\nof all Characters, the thorow-selfish one is the least forward in\ntaking Party. (C 1.114\u201315)\n\n\nSome have tried to show that all of these seemingly sociable\ntendencies result only from \u201ca more deliberate, or\nbetter-regulated Self-love\u201d (C 1.118). But (according\nto Shaftesbury) such views either fail to explain what people actually\ndo or collapse into tautology (C 2.226\u20137).\n\nAgainst Hobbes himself, Shaftesbury presents a pleasantly ironic\nad hominem argument. If Hobbes had truly been entirely\nconcerned with his own self-interest, he would never have publicly\nadvanced the view that people are motivated entirely by self-interest.\nHe would, rather, have spoken \u201cthe best of human Nature\u201d\nso that he could \u201cthe easier abuse it\u201d (C 1.94). But\nHobbes did not behave in this way. He tried to convince people of the\nselfishness of human beings precisely because he wanted to help humans\nbeings, even though this conduct placed him at great peril. His very\nadvancement of the selfish thesis refutes it. That\n\n\ngood sociable Man, as savage and unsociable as he wou\u2019d make\nhimself and all Mankind appear by his Philosophy, expos\u2019d\nhimself during his Life, and took the utmost pains, that after his\nDeath we might be deliver\u2019d from the occasion of these Terrors.\nHe did his utmost to shew us \u2026 that there was nothing which by\nNature \u2026 drew us to the Love of what was without, or beyond\nour-selves: Tho the Love of such great Truths and sovereign\nMaxims as he imagin\u2019d these to be, made him the most laborious\nof all Men in composing Systems of this kind for our Use; and\nforc\u2019d him, notwithstanding his natural Fear, to run continually\nthe highest risk of being a Martyr for our Deliverance. (C\n1.89\u201390)\n\n\nAccording to Shaftesbury, both Hobbes and the voluntarists believed\nthat the only motive humans have to be moral is that a powerful being\nwill reward them for virtue and punish them for vice. The\nHobbesian\u2019s rewards and punishments are meted out by the\nsovereign, the voluntarist\u2019s by God. Were it not for this\npowerful being\u2019s rewards and punishments, according to\nShaftesbury\u2019s understanding of Hobbesianism and the voluntarism,\nhumans would have no motivating reasons to be moral. In an oft-cited\nletter, Shaftesbury places Locke in the same category as Hobbes and\nthe voluntarists, condemning the lot of them for reducing all moral\nmotivation to these selfish concerns. (For discussion of this letter\nand Shaftesbury\u2019s philosophical relationship to Locke, see Carey\n2006: 98 and 138; Stuart-Buttle 2019: 90-105). Central to much of\nShaftesbury\u2019s account of morality, in contrast, is the claim\nthat people are virtuous only to the extent that they are motivated by\nsomething other than selfish concern to gain reward and avoid\npunishment (C 2.23, 2.25, 2.60, 2.66). According to Shaftesbury,\nvirtue consists not in the actions people perform, but in their\nmotives for performing them. And the motive with which we identify\nvirtue is concern for humanity, not selfishness. Shaftesbury\nemphasizes this point by drawing attention to the difference between\nknaves and saints. In order to be motivated to do the right thing,\nknaves \u201cstand in need of such a rectifying Object as the\nGallows before their eyes,\u201d but someone truly honest will\nnot have such a need.\n\n\nAnd if a Saint had no other Virtue than what\nwas rais\u2019d in him by the same Objects of Reward and Punishment,\nin a more distant State; I know not whose Love or Esteem he might gain\nbesides, but for my own part, I shou\u2019d never think him worthy of\nmine. (C 1.127)\n\n\nWe judge saints to be virtuous because we think they are motivated by\nsomething other than the selfishness of the knave. If we came to\nbelieve that the saints were motivated by self-interest as well (e.g.,\nby desire for reward in the afterlife), we would no longer judge them\nto be virtuous. As Shaftesbury puts it,\n\n\nIf the Love of doing good, be not, of it-self, a good and\nright Inclination; I know not how there can possibly be such\na thing as Goodness or Virtue. (C 1.98)\n\n\nShaftesbury maintains, further, that stressing reward and punishment\nis actually counterproductive to the promotion of virtue. This is\nbecause a stress on reward and punishment tends to crowd out or\nobliterate the intrinsic concern for the good of the species that is\nessential to true virtue. He writes,\n\n\nI Have known a Building, which by the Officiousness of the Workmen has\nbeen so shor\u2019d, and screw\u2019d up, on the\nside where they pretended it had a Leaning, that it has at last been\nturn\u2019d the contrary way, and overthrown. There has something,\nperhaps, of this kind happen\u2019d in Morals. Men have not\nbeen contented to shew the natural Advantages of Honesty and Virtue.\nThey have rather lessen\u2019d these, the better, as they thought, to\nadvance another Foundation. They have made Virtue so\nmercenary a thing, and have talk\u2019d so much of its\nRewards, that one can hardly tell what there is in it, after\nall, which can be worth rewarding. (C 1.97; see also 2.33\u201334 and\n39\u201340)\n\n\nPeople who dwell on reward and punishment are more likely to become\noverly concerned with their own \u201cSelf-good, and private\nInterest,\u201d which must \u201cinsensibly diminish the Affections\ntowards publick Good, or the Interest of Society and introduce a\ncertain Narrowness of spirit\u201d (C 2.58). Stressing reward and\npunishment cannot make people more virtuous, and it may very well make\nthem less so (C 1.97\u201398, 2.52\u201356). It is for this reason\nthat Shaftesbury has one of his characters in The Moralists\nsay that the author of the Inquiry\n\n\nendeavors chiefly to establish Virtue on Principles, by which\nhe is able to argue with those who are not as yet induc\u2019d to own\na God, or Future State. If he cannot\ndo thus much, he reckons he does nothing. (C 2.266\u20137)\n\n\nShaftesbury here seems to anticipate the \u201coverjustification\nhypothesis\u201d of Lepper, Greene, and Nisbitt (1973).\n\nIn his discussions of Hobbes and the voluntarists, then, Shaftesbury\nseems to be attacking the view that humans are motivated only by\nself-interest and, relatedly, that self-interest is the only reason\nfor us to be moral. This anti-egoist reading can also point to\nShaftesbury\u2019s aesthetic views, which center on the idea that our\nlove of beauty is entirely non-selfish (see Stolnitz 1961a and b).\nShaftesbury makes this seemingly anti-egoistic aesthetic point when he\ndistinguishes the entirely non-selfish appreciation of a thing\u2019s\nbeauty from the self-interested desire to own or command that thing\n(2.396\u20137).\n\nOther commentators, however, interpret Shaftesbury as an egoist, and\neven a hedonist egoist, as someone who holds that every human action\nis motivated by the agent\u2019s desires for his or her own pleasure\n(Sidgwick 1902: 185; Peach 1958; Trianosky 1978; Grote 2010; for\ndiscussion of Shaftesbury and hedonist view, see Crisp 2019,\n84\u20135 and 91). A crucial text for the egoist reading is the\nbeginning of Book 2 of the Inquiry, where Shaftesbury\nwrites\n\n\nWe have consider\u2019d what Virtue\nis, and to whom the Character belongs. It remains to inquiry,\nWhat Obligation there is to Virtue;\nor what Reason to embrace it. (C\n2.45)\n\n\nShaftesbury goes on to argue that being moral is in every\nperson\u2019s own best interests\u2014that one will be happier if\none is virtuous rather than vicious. As he sums up his argument in the\nconclusion of the Inquiry,\n\n\nThus have we endeavour\u2019d to prove what was propos\u2019d in the\nbeginning\u2026 To be wicked or vitious, is to be\nmiserable and unhappy\u2026 On the other side; the\nHappiness and Good of Virtue has\nbeen prov\u2019d. (C 2.98\u201399)\n\n\nAnd again:\n\n\n\u201cThat to yield or consent to any thing ill or immoral, is a\nBreach of Interest, and leads to the greatest Ills\u201d: and,\n\u201cThat on the other side, Every thing which is an Improvement\nof Virtue, or an Establishment of right Affection and Integrity, is an\nAdvancement of Interest, and leads to the greatest and most solid\nHappiness and Enjoyment.\u201d (C 2.100).\n\n\nThis performance in the Inquiry is the basis for\ninterpretations that claim that Shaftesbury believes that the only\nsalient answer that could be given to the question, Why be moral?, is\nthat being moral is in one\u2019s own self-interest\u2014and, more\ngenerally, that Shaftesbury thinks that self-interest is the only\nultimate reason for action.\n\nHow do egoistic interpretations handle the many texts in which\nShaftesbury attacks selfish theories of morality and human nature?\nSome have come to the exasperated conclusion that Shaftesbury is\nsimply inconsistent, sometimes assuming egoism sometimes opposing it\n(Martineau 1886: 508; Wiley 1940: 74). Others have argued that\nShaftesbury\u2019s criticisms of selfish theories do not conflict\nwith an overall egoistic interpretation. Grote (2010) maintains that\nwhen Shaftesbury attacks Hobbes, the voluntarists, and other\n\u201cselfish\u201d theorists, he is not attacking the view that\nself-interest is the only reason to be virtuous but rather is\nattacking the view that externally-bestowed rewards and\npunishments are the only reasons to be virtuous. According to Grote,\nwhat Shaftesbury means to show is that virtue has decisive\n\u201cnatural advantages\u201d\u2014that being virtuous will make\none happier regardless of what anyone else may do to you.\nShaftesbury\u2019s opponents, on this reading, are those who claim\nthat the relevant self-interested considerations are the rewards and\npunishment meted out by God or sovereign. The crucial contrast is\nbetween, on the one hand, the arbitrariness of the rewards and\npunishments of the voluntarist God and the Hobbesian sovereign and, on\nthe other hand, the naturalness of the internal mental enjoyments that\ncome from being virtuous\u2014not the contrast between\nself-interested and non-self-interested motives.\n\nSuch is how egoistic interpretations attempt to explain away what many\nhave taken to be Shaftesbury\u2019s attacks on egoist explanations of\nhuman behavior. How do anti-egoist interpretations attempt to explain\naway the efforts Shaftesbury makes in Book 2 of the Inquiry\nto show that virtue\u2019s conduciveness to one\u2019s own happiness\nis reason to embrace it? Schneewind denies Shaftesbury ever tries\n\u201cto bribe the reader into becoming virtuous, by showing that it\npays\u201d (Schneewind 1998: 308). According to Schneewind, in Book 2\nof the Inquiry Shaftesbury is\n\n\ntrying to show that the natural world\u2014the realm in which the\nnatural good of happiness exists\u2014is such that it makes sense for\nus to act morally within it. (Schneewind 1998: 308)\n\n\nIrwin argues that virtuous Shaftesburean agents have an immediate\naversion to vice that is based on a kind of aesthetic disgust-reaction\nrather than a reflective calculation about what will benefit them in\nthe long run (Irwin 2008: 357).\n\nIrwin also thinks we can find in Shaftesbury elements of a eudaimonist\ntheory, according to which \u201cit is reasonable to examine the\ncontribution of virtue to happiness\u201d because \u201cthe pursuit\nof happiness [is] the pursuit of rational structure and\nharmony\u201d\u2014which does not collapse into the Hobbesian egoist\nview that we should be virtuous because it maximizes our pleasure\n(Irwin 2008: 357). Den Uyl also locates in Shaftesbury something akin\nto \u201ca classical virtue ethics\u201d (Den Uyl 1998: 292). Crisp\nthinks \u201cShaftesbury\u2019s account is Aristotelian,\u201d in\nthat one\u2019s happiness is one\u2019s chief good but the virtuous\nperson \u201crecognizes that their good itself consists in virtuous\nactivity, which will itself involve direct concern for the good of\nothers for their own sake\u201d (Crisp 2019: 79). Filonowicz argues\nthat virtue and happiness are so closely identified in Shaftesbury\nthat it distorts his view to claim that we seek one as a mere means\nfor the other. Shaftesbury is not trying to show\n\n\nthat we are required to be moral by the sheer personal utility of\nbeing so\u2026 [H]is point, rather, [is] that questions of expected\noverall benefit or less will seem moot to anyone who has actually\nachieved, and so experienced, moral health or harmony of affection.\nVirtue is experienced as being its own reward. (Filonowicz 2008:\n86)\n\n\nOn the eudaimonist interpretation of Shaftesbury, virtue benefits its\npossessor, but the person who possesses virtue does not do the right\nthing because she thinks it will make her happy. To possess virtue is\nto be committed to certain values, and it\u2019s those values that\nmotivate the virtuous person, not the self-interested benefits that\nmay result. Indeed, a virtuous person will sacrifice what are\ntypically considered benefits to self in order to live up to those\nvalues. Caring about other people is not merely a means to some\ndistinct pleasurable experience. Caring about other people for their\nown sakes is itself essential to, is constitutive of, the experience\nof living well. Virtue is intrinsically choice-worthy. Annas (2008)\nhas shown the same combination of claims\u2014that virtue consists of\ncaring non-instrumentally about certain kinds of conduct that are\nobjectively proper for human beings, and that the reason to be\nvirtuous is that it will lead to the best life\u2014is present in\nmany eudaimonist views.\n\nIn his Essay on the Passions, Hutcheson addresses the same\nquestion that non-egoist interpretations of Shaftesbury must face in\nlight of Shaftesbury\u2019s arguments for the coincidence of virtue\nand interest\u2014i.e., if virtue is non-self-interested, why show\nthat virtue is in everyone\u2019s self-interest? Hutcheson\nwrites,\n\n\nIt may perhaps seem strange, that when in this Treatise\nVirtue is supposed disinterested; yet so much Pains is taken,\nby a Comparison of our several Pleasures, to prove\nthe Pleasures of Virtue to be the greatest we are capable of,\nand that consequently it is truest Interest to be\nvirtuous. (Hutcheson 1742: viii)\n\n\nHutcheson goes on to maintain that while virtue does consist of truly\nnon-selfish concern for humanity, it is still useful to show that\nvirtue does not conflict with happiness, as that will prevent people\nfrom believing in a conflict between the two ends that would\nconstitute a great obstacle to virtue. It seems possible that\nShaftesbury was anticipating this Hutchesonian thought (a thought that\nHutcheson attributes to Shaftesbury) when arguing in Book 2 of the\nInquiry for the coincidence of virtue and happiness.\n\nRegardless of whether or not Shaftesbury is accurately characterized\nas egoistic, he clearly does contend that virtue conduces to\none\u2019s happiness and vice to one\u2019s misery\u2014that\n\u201cVirtue and Interest may be found at last to\nagree\u201d (C 2.16). And he develops a psychological explanation for\nthis agreement. Central to this explanation is his distinction between\npleasures of the body and pleasures of the mind. Shaftesbury argues\nthat a person\u2019s happiness depends more on mental pleasures than\non bodily pleasures. He then seeks to show that living virtuously is\nby far the best way to gain the crucially important mental pleasures\n(C 2.47\u201373). Shaftesbury bases much of his argument for the\nconnection between virtue and happiness on the idea that the mental\npleasures are within one\u2019s own control, insulated from the\nvicissitudes of \u201cFortune, Age, Circumstances, and Humour\u201d\n(C 2.434). As one of Shaftesbury\u2019s characters rhetorically\nasks,\n\n\nHow can we better praise the goodness of Providence, than in\nthis, \u2018That it has plac\u2019d our Happiness and Good in things\nWe can bestow upon ourselves\u2019? (C 2.435; see\n2.228\u201334)\n\n\nIn arguing for the importance of the mental pleasures, Shaftesbury\nalso develops a view of the difference between higher and lower\npleasures\u2014and of the superiority of the former\u2014that\nclearly anticipates Mill\u2019s use of that distinction in chapter 2\nof Utilitarianism (C 2.228\u201334; see Crisp 2019,\n88\u201391).\n\nOne of the most famous claims in Characteristicks is that\nbeauty and good are one and the same (C 2.399, 415, 422). Many\ncommentators have criticized this claim for being obscure, confused,\nor incoherent (Brown 1751, 162; Martineau 1886, 498; Albee 1916, 183;\nTiffany 1923, 667; Bernstein 1977, 325; Filonowicz 2008, 101\u20132;\nCrisp 2019, 83\u201384). But in the context of The\nMoralists, the claim turns out to be a straightforward statement\nof Shaftesbury\u2019s view that a person will be happiest if she\nmakes moral beauty (i.e., virtue) her highest priority. The claim that\nbeauty and good are one and the same, in other words, is\nShaftesbury\u2019s way of expressing in the The Moralists the\nInquiry\u2019s conclusion that \u201cVirtue is the\nGood, and Vice the Ill of every\u2013one\u201d (C\n2.177). (See Gill 2021. See also Axelsson 2019, 208.)\n\nMuch of the interpretative discussion of Shaftesbury\u2019s response\nto the question, Why be moral?, has focused on Book 2 of the\nInquiry. But Shaftesbury discusses the issue in Wit and\nHumour and Soliloquy as well, asking in the later:\n\u201cWhy shou\u2019d a Man be honest in the dark?\u201d\n(C 1.125). Shaftesbury suggests that a person who asks this question\nis already lost to virtue\u2014that someone who cares about virtue\nfor its own sake won\u2019t need another reason to act virtuously,\nand that someone who needs another reason doesn\u2019t have what it\ntakes to be truly virtuous in the first place. Shaftesbury also\nsuggests that we should be honest even in the dark (i.e., virtuous\neven when we will not be punished for vice) because such conduct is a\nnecessary condition for having an identity or unified self at all (C\n1.283\u20134). The importance of developing a (unified) self is a\nstriking, recurring theme in Shaftesbury\u2019s writings, and he\nsuggests that helping one to develop such a self is the raison\nd\u2019etre of philosophy (see Mijuskovic 1971, Winkler 2000,\nPurviance 2004, and Jaffro 2014; more on this below).\n\nAn additional response Shaftesbury offers to \u201cwhy be\nmoral?\u201d is to equate a commitment to morality to the love of\nbeauty (Brown 1995; Gill 2014). He writes,\n\n\n[A] real Genius, and thorow Artist, in whatever\nkind, can never, without the greatest unwillingness and shame, be\ninduc\u2019d to act below his Character, and for mere Interest be\nprevail\u2019d with to prostitute his Art or Science, by performing\ncontrary to its known Rules\u2026 Be they ever so idle, dissolute,\nor debauch\u2019d; how regardless soever of other Rules; they abhor\nany Transgression in their Art, and wou\u2019d chuse to lose\nCustomers and starve, rather than by a base Compliance with the World,\nto act contrary to what they call the\nJustness and Truth of Work.\n\n\u201cSir\u201d, (says a poor Fellow of this kind, to his rich\nCustomer) \u201cyou are mistaken in coming to me, for such a piece of\nWorkmanship. Let who will make it for you, as you fansy; I know it to\nbe wrong. Whatever I have made hither to, has been true\nWork. And neither for your sake or any body\u2019s else, shall I\nput my hand to any other\u201d.\n\nThis is Virtue! real Virtue, and Love of Truth;\nindependent of Opinion, and above the World.\nThis Disposition transfer\u2019d to the\nwhole of Life, perfects a Character, and makes that\nProbity and Worth which the Learned are often at\nsuch a loss to explain. For is there not a Workmanship and\na Truth in Actions? (C\n1.261\u20132)\n\n\nHere Shaftesbury points out that we readily accept the possibility of\nartists remaining committed to their art, regardless of the external\nrewards that may result from betraying it. We don\u2019t think such\nartists need an answer to the question, \u201cWhy produce excellent\nworks rather than poor ones?\u201d because we understand their\nvaluing the art as an end in itself. But one\u2019s\nlife\u2014one\u2019s character and conduct\u2014can be, or can fail\nto be, morally beautiful. And the commitment people who appreciate\nmoral beauty have to instantiate it can have the same force on their\nconduct as an artist\u2019s commitment to produce excellent works.\nSome might think that connecting morality and beauty in this way\nminimizes or undermines the importance of morality. But given\nShaftesbury\u2019s realist view of beauty\u2014and his equating of\nbeauty and truth\u2014no such thing follows on his account. Just as a\ntrue artist never considers producing bad art, a truly honest person\n\u201cnever deliberates\u201d about whether to be honest. \u201cHe\nacts from his Nature, in a manner necessarily, and without Reflection.\n. . . He can\u2019t deliberate in the Case of a plain Villainy\u201d\n(C 1.81). Shaftesbury is here describing a commitment to virtue that\nseems to be closer to traditional deontological views, in that it has\na non-negotiable, overriding practical authority. Like a traditional\ndeontologist, Shaftesbury thinks the virtuous person will do the right\nthing regardless of any other consequences that may result. Moral\nreasons have a practical authority that is intrinsic to them, not the\nresult of their being commanded or of their being instrumental to any\nother end. But Shaftesbury differs from many traditional deontologists\nin the role he gives to sentiment. Traditional deontologists believe\nthat rationality alone grounds morality\u2019s authority.\nShaftesbury\u2019s non-negotiable commitment to morality, in\ncontrast, is based in the sentiment. Shaftesbury\u2019s picture of an\nimpassioned and dedicated artist models a commitment to doing\nwhat\u2019s right that is based in sentiment but is nonetheless\ncategorical.\n\nAs I mentioned above, some commentators take Shaftesbury to be not\nonly egoistic but also hedonistic, attributing to him the view that\nthe ultimate practical justification is always pleasure for the agent\n(Grote 2010; Martineau 1886, 508; Peach 1958; Trianosky 1978; see also\nCrisp 2019, 84\u20135). Book 2 of the Inquiry seems to provide\nevidence for this reading, as Shaftesbury argues there that the reason\nto be virtuous is that it will make us happiest, and the reasons he\ngives for its making us happiest often involve the virtuous\nlife\u2019s producing greater quantity and quality of pleasure (see C\n2.99\u2013105, 126\u2013130, 147\u2013154, 168\u2013177).\n\nThere are, however, numerous other places in Chararacteristicks\nwhere Shaftesbury explicitly rejects that pleasure is the true or\nultimate measure of choice-worthiness. He ridicules those who\n\u201crate Life by the Number of Exquisiteness of the\npleasing Sensations\u201d (C 1.123). He holds that the truly\nvirtuous person has a non-negotiable commitment to virtue that defies\nhedonistic weighing (C 1.129\u201330, 1.133, 1.261\u20132). He\ndismisses as absurd the proverb \u201cThat Tastes are different,\nand must not be disputed\u201d (C 2.228). He explicitly contends\n\u201cthat Pleasure is no rule of Good,\u201d because we\njudge which pleasures are and are not worth pursuing (C. 1.309; see\nalso 2.249\u201350). I shouldn\u2019t fancy things \u201cas I\nplease\u201d; rather I should \u201clearn to fansy, to\nadmire, to please, as the Subjects themselves are\ndeserving\u201d (C 1.339). My rule of choice should not be\n\u201cbecause I please\u201d (C 1.339). I should ask,\n\u201cis this Pleasure right?\u201d (C 1.340). The question\nis not whether something pleases, but \u201cwhether we are\nrightly pleas\u2019d\u201d (C 2.227). Only some pleasures are\nreally good, not all of them (C 2.229\u201330). We should define the\nchoice-worthiness of pleasures by whether they are good; we\nshouldn\u2019t define goodness by pleasure. The only sense in which\nit\u2019s true that pleasure is what we always seek is the empty\ntautological sense according to which pleasure is just defined as that\nwhich \u201cwe think eligible\u201d (C 2.227; see also\n2.233\u201334).\n\nHow does Shaftesbury\u2019s rejection of pleasure as the measure of\nchoice-worthiness square with his seeming reliance in Book 2 of the\nInquiry on virtue\u2019s superiority at producing pleasure?\nPerhaps the eudaimonist reading explained above accounts for the\ncombination of his claims that the virtuous person acts for\nnon-self-interested reasons and that the virtuous person has a more\npleasurable life than the vicious. Alternatively, the hedonistic\ninterpretation might read the criticisms of pleasure as actually\ncriticisms only of physical pleasures, not of mental pleasures.\nAnother possibility is that Shaftesbury changed his mind. In the\nInquiry, which he wrote early in his career, he emphasized\npleasure. In The Moralists, Common Sense, and\nSoliloquy, which he wrote later, he de-emphasized pleasure,\nindicating a move away from an early hedonistic view.\n",
