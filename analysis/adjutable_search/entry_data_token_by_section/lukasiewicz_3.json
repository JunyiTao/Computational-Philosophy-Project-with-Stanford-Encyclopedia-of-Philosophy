    "main_text": "Propositional Logic || Discoveries in Propositional Logic\n4.1 Discoveries in Propositional Logic\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz came across propositional logic, which he originally\nfollowed Whitehead and Russell in calling \u2018theory of\ndeduction\u2019, in their work and also in that of Frege. In 1921\n\u0141ukasiewicz published a ground-clearing article,\n\u201cTwo-Valued Logic\u201d, in which he brought together results\nin the algebra of logic governing the two truth-values true and false,\nwhich, like Frege, \u0141ukasiewicz construed as what sentences or\npropositions denoted, but for which, unlike Frege, he\nintroduced constant propositional symbols \u20181\u2019 and\n\u20180\u2019. He intended it as the first part of a monograph on\nthree-valued logic, which however was never completed, probably\nbecause \u0141ukasiewicz became dissatisfied with the rather hybrid\napproach which was already being outdated by his rapid development.\nThe article is notable for several innovations. Using a symbolism\nderived from those of Couturat and Peirce, it introduces the idea of\naxiomatic rejection alongside that of axiomatic assertion, which\nlatter was of course familiar from Frege, Whitehead and Russell. The\nconstants \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 also occur in asserted\nand rejected formulas, in effect setting up an object-language version\nof truth-tables. To show this we use \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s later\nparenthesis-free notation (see the supplementary document\n (\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s Parenthesis-Free or Polish Notation)\n and his symbols \u2018\\(\\vdash\\)\u2019 for assertion and\n\u2018\\(\\dashv\\)\u2019 for rejection, to be read respectively as\n\u201cI assert\u201d and \u201cI reject\u201d. The first\nprinciples of logic are simply \\({\\vdash}1\\) and \\({\\dashv}0\\) but to\nindicate the tabulation for implication the following principles must\nbe adhered to: \\({\\vdash}C00, {\\vdash}C01, {\\dashv}C10, {\\vdash}C11\\).\nWhen \u0141ukasiewicz employed propositional variables, he quantified\nthem in the manner of Peirce, using \u2018\\(\\Pi\\)\u2019 for the\nuniversal and \u2018\\(\\Sigma\\)\u2019 for the particular\nquantifier.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz and his students made the study of propositional\ncalculi very much their own: the results obtained between 1920 and\n1930 were published in a 1930 joint paper of \u0141ukasiewicz and\nTarski, \u201cUntersuchungen \u00fcber den\nAussagenkalk\u00fcl\u201d. Work proceeded on both classical\n(bivalent) and many-valued calculi. The clearest and most complete\ndemonstration of how \u0141ukasiewicz in his maturity treated\nclassical propositional calculus comes in his 1929 student textbook,\nbased on lecture notes, Elements of Mathematical Logic. The\nsystem, following Frege, is based on implication \\((C)\\) and negation\n\\((N)\\) alone, with the elegant axiom set \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n&CCpqCCqrCpr \\\\\n &CCNppp \\\\\n &CpCNpq \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nand three rules of inference: modus ponens, a rule of uniform\nsubstitution of formulas for propositional variables, and a rule of\ndefinitional replacement. On this basis, and using an extremely\ncompressed linear notation for proofs which is at the opposite extreme\nof Frege\u2019s space-occupying proofs, \u0141ukasiewicz proves\naround 140 theorems in a mere 19 pages.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz, aided and abetted by students and colleagues, not\njust Tarski but also Adolf Lindenbaum, Jerzy S\u0142upecki,\nBoles\u0142aw Soboci\u0144ski, Mordechaj Wajsberg and others,\ninvestigated not only the full (functionally complete) propositional\ncalculus, with different sets of connectives as basic, including the\nSheffer functor D, but also partial calculi, in particular\nthe pure implicational calculus (based on C alone) and the\npure equivalential calculus (based on E alone). They strove\nto find axioms sets satisfying a number of normative criteria: axioms\nshould be as few as possible, as short as possible, independent, with\nas few primitives as possible. Undoubtedly there was a competitive\nelement to the search for ever better axiom systems, in particular in\nthe attempt to find single axioms for various systems, and the\nexercise has been smiled upon or even belittled as a mere\n\u201csport\u201d, but the Polish preoccupation with improving axiom\nsystems was a search for logical perfection, an illustration of what\nJan Wole\u0144ski has termed \u201clogic for logic\u2019s\nsake\u201d. At one time it was thought, not without some\njustification, that only Poles could compete. When Tarski once\ncongratulated the American logician Emil Post on being the only\nnon-Pole to make fundamental contributions to propositional logic,\nPost replied that he had been born in August\u00f3w and his mother\ncame from Bia\u0142ystok. Later, \u0141ukasiewicz was to find in the\nIrish mathematician Carew Meredith a worthy non-Pole who could outdo\neven the Poles in the brevity of his axioms (see Meredith 1953).\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz used many-valued matrices to establish the\nindependence of logical axioms in systems of Frege, Russell and\nothers. He proved the completeness of full, implicational and\nequivalential calculi, and proved that the equivalential calculus\ncould be based on the single axiom \\(EEpqErqEpr\\), with substitution\nand detachment for equivalence, and showed further that no shorter\naxiom could be the sole axiom of the system. Tarski showed in 1925\nthat the pure implicational calculus could be based on a single axiom,\nbut a series of improvements by Wajsberg and \u0141ukasiewicz led to\nthe latter\u2019s discovering in 1936 that the formula\n\\(CCCpqrCCrpCsp\\) could serve as single axiom and that no shorter\naxiom would suffice, though the publication of this result had to wait\nuntil 1948.\n",
