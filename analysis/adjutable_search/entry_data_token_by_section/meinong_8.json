    "main_text": "Object Theory \u2014 Ontology beyond Being and Non-Being || Incomplete Objects\n5.2 Incomplete Objects\n5.2.1 Incomplete Objects and Their Logic\n\nIn his 1915, \u00a725, Meinong introduces in more detail the notion of\nincompletely determined objects, i.e., objects that are\nundetermined with respect to at least one property. Pure things like\nthe triangle as such are incomplete objects. The triangle as such has\nthree angles (a constitutive property), it has three sides (a\nconsecutive property, one that is somehow included in the\nobject\u2019s constitutive properties), but it is neither scalene nor\nnon-scalene, neither green nor non-green etc. In such cases denying\nthat a is F does not imply affirming that a\nis not F, because the denial that a is F\nmay also be correct when a is not determined with respect to\nF. Incomplete objects infringe the law of excluded middle\n(and impossible objects infringe the law of noncontradiction) with\nrespect to internal negation only (predicate negation:\n\u201c~\u201d) and not with respect to external negation (sentence\nnegation: \u201c\u00ac\u201d). Meinong would have acknowledged the\nvalidity of\n\nLaw of Noncontradiction:\n\u2200F\u2200x\u00ac(Fx \u2227\n\u00acFx)\n\n\nand\n\nLaw of Excluded Middle:\n\u2200F\u2200x(Fx \u2228\n\u00acFx)\n\n\nbut he would also have admitted the theses:\n\n\u2203F\u2203x[Fx \u2227\n(~F)x]\n\n\u2203F\u2203x \u00ac[Fx \u2228\n(~F)x]\n\n\nMore recent philosophical work shows that characterizing\ndeterminations can be constructed which go against any classical\nlogical law. The object the square such that it is not the case\nthat it is square is characterized as being square and also being\nsuch that it is not the case that it is square. These two\ndeterminations, however, lead to a contradiction involving external\nnegation. (See Routley 1980; Simons 1992: 185; Thrush 2001b.)\n5.2.2 Indeterminacy with Respect to Being\n\nWith respect to being, Meinong states that all complete objects have\neither being or non-being, and all incomplete objects lack being.\nMeinong\u2019s indifference principle accommodates the law of\nexcluded middle in the external but not in the internal version. From\nthe fact that incomplete objects do not have being, it does not follow\nthat they have non-being as well. Some of them, for example,\nincomplete objects that are also contradictorily determined, have\nnon-being; others, like the triangle as such, are not determined with\nrespect to being at all.\n\nUsing \u201cB!\u201d as an abbreviation for Meinong\u2019s\n\u201chas being\u201d, this can be summed up as follows:\n\nIf object x is determined with respect to being\n[seinsbestimmt] then \u00ac(B!x) \u2192\n(~B!)x.\nIf x is not determined with respect to being then\n\u00ac[\u00ac(B!x) \u2192\n(~B!)x].\n\u201c\u00ac(B!x)\u201d either implies\n\u201c(~B!)x\u201d or \u201cx is not\ndetermined with respect to being\u201d.\n\n\nThis indeterminacy with respect to being\n[Seinsunbestimmtheit] must not be mixed up with the\nindifference to being (or outside-being [Au\u00dfersein]),\nbecause every object has outside-being whereas only some of them\n\u2014 the square (as such), for example \u2014 are not determined\nwith respect to being (1915, \u00a725).\n5.2.3 Incomplete Objects as the Territory \u201cWhere Possibility Is at Home\u201d\n\nIncomplete objects play an important role in Meinong\u2019s late\nphilosophy, for instance as \u201cauxiliary objects\u201d to\nindicate the (usually complete) target objects of our intending (see\nbelow Section 6), and as the basis of ascribing possibility and\ndegrees of possibility to objectives. Some objectives are factual,\nsome nonfactual [untats\u00e4chlich], and some are neither\n(i.e. \u201csubfactual\u201d [untertats\u00e4chlich]). The\nsubfactual objectives, which concern incomplete objects, constitute\nthe proper territory \u201cwhere possibility is at home\u201d (1915,\n\u00a724: 167). Incomplete objects that are not determined with\nrespect to being serve as the foundation of possibility insofar as\nneither the factuality nor the nonfactuality of their being and their\nso-being (except their constitutive properties) is specified. For\ninstance, the objective expressed by the sentence \u201cThe\n[incomplete] object the (fair) die will show a three with the\nnext throw\u201d has neither factuality nor nonfactuality, but it is\nsubfactual to the degree of 1/6. The borderline cases are degree 1\n(factuality) and degree 0 (nonfactuality). Meinong states that\nincomplete objects can somehow be embedded or involved in complete\nobjects, not like a part in a whole, but rather in the sense that for\ncertain incomplete objects there are (more) complete ones which have\nat least all the determinations that the incomplete objects in\nquestion have. Such an incomplete object, the die, for instance, can\nbe said to be implected [implektiert] in a (more)\ncomplete object: this white ivory die, for instance (1915, \u00a729;\nsee also Section 6 below). One may apply the possibility ascription of\nincomplete objects to the corresponding complete objects in an\nindirect way. If the throw of a concrete die actually shows a three,\nthe objective \u201cThis die shows a three\u201d is factual (degree\nof possibility = 1) and we cannot say that it really has the\npossibility degree of 1/6. This degree of possibility can be\nattributed to this throw in a derivative way only; its possibility is\n1/6 in so far as the throw is treated merely as a throw of a fair\ndie.\n",
