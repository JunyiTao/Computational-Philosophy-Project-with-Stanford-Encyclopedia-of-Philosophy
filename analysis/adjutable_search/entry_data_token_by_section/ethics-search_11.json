Moral Accountability and Social-Responsibility Issues for Search Engine Companies\n\n\nThus far, issues from the perspectives of business ethics and\nprofessional responsibility have not been directly addressed in this\nentry; our main focus in Section 3 has been on the kinds of moral\nimpacts that search engines have for ordinary users, especially with\nrespect to privacy, surveillance, and freedom. In Section 3.1, however,\nwe hinted that search engine companies (SECs) might be held morally\naccountable for their practices involving bias in the ranking of search\nresults. And in concluding Section 3.4, we briefly entertained the\nnotion that major SECs might be held accountable for policies and\npractices that either favor or directly support censorship. In this\nsection, we consider whether SECs have any special social\nresponsibilities and moral obligations because of their\n\u201cprivileged place\u201d in our society. We begin by briefly\ndescribing a key societal role that search engines play in providing\naccess to information and knowledge.\n\n\nElgesem (2008, 241) notes that search engines have an important\nsocietal role as \u201ccontributors to the public use of reason\n\u201d, and Noble (2018, 148) argues that search results can actually\n\u201cstructure knowledge\u201d for the societies within which they\noperate. As we already noted in Section 3, Hinman (2005, 2008) and\nDiaz (2008) view search engines as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of\nknowledge on the Web. Taddeo and Floridi (2016, 1575), who also\ndescribe the important \u201cgatekeeping function\u201d that SECs\nlike Google now have because of their \u201ccentrality\u201d in\ninformation societies, worry about the lack of consensus thus far with\nregard to which \u201cprinciples should shape\u2026[an\nSEC\u2019s]\u2026moral responsibilities and practices.\u201d The\nauthors argue that we need an \u201cethical framework\u201d both to\n\u201cdefine\u201d an SEC\u2019s responsibilities and\n\u201cprovide the fundamental sharable principles\u201d necessary to\nguide an SEC\u2019s conduct \u201cwithin the multicultural and\ninternational context in which they operate.\u201d But Taddeo and\nFloridi also believe that this problem applies to other kinds of major\n\u201conline service providers,\u201d which the authors refer to as\n\u201cOSPs\u201d; they include Facebook and Twitter as well as\nGoogle under that category. However, we limit our focus on\nmoral-responsibility issues in this section to SECs per se.\n\n\nDoes the central role that major SECs like Google and Bing now play\nas \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of knowledge in our information society\nentail some special responsibilities for them? Hinman (2005, 21) lists\nfour reasons why these companies should shoulder significant social\nresponsibility. First, he notes that search engines \u201cplay an\nabsolutely crucial role\u201d in accessing information and that\nwithout them, the Web would \u201csimply be inaccessible to us\u201d\nand thus \u201calmost useless.\u201d Second, he points out that\naccess to information is \u201ccrucial for responsible\ncitizenship,\u201d also noting that \u201ccitizens in a democracy\ncannot make informed decisions without access to accurate\ninformation.\u201d Third, Hinman notes that search engines have become\n\u201ccentral to education,\u201d and he points out that students now\nsearch on Google and other major search engines more frequently than\nthey visit libraries. Fourth, he points out that major search engines\nare owned by private corporations \u2013 i.e., by businesses that are\nmainly, and \u201cquite properly,\u201d interested in making a\nprofit. Regarding Hinman\u2019s fourth point, it would seem that\nconflicts can easily arise because of an SEC\u2019s mission to be\nprofitable and its broader societal role in providing access to\ninformation in a manner that is fair, accurate, and unbiased.\n",
