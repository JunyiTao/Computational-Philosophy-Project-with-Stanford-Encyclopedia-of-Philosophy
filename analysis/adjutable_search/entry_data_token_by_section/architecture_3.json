    "main_text": "What is Architecture? || The Sort of Enterprise Architecture Is\n2.1 The Sort of Enterprise Architecture Is\nOne approach to grasping the true nature of architecture is to\ndefine it in terms of the discipline. We may embrace the disciplinary\ndeterminism of the British architect Cedric Price: \u201cArchitecture\nis what architects do\u201d. Defining the discipline or practice of\narchitecture may seem a simple empirical affair. Even if we have\ndifficulty assessing what architectural objects or products are, we\ncan point to thousands of architects over several millennia around the\nworld engaged in one or another sets of activities that conventionally\nhave been associated with architectural practice, and generate a long\ndisjunctive claim about what architects do. An empirically rooted\napproach has a long history: Vitruvius devises his normative account\nof the virtuous architect on the basis of his familiarity with\nthen-contemporary practice. The same is true of other traditional\naccounts of virtue in architects or builders, as in the sixth to\neighth century Indian M\u0101nas\u0101ra\n(\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0938\u093e\u0930) (Acharya 1928) and\neleventh century Chinese Yingzao fashi\n(\u71df\u9020\u6cd5\u5f0f) (Feng 2012). In the present-day,\nsociology of the architectural profession offers a detailed empirical\nperspective (Gutman 1988), and this can be extended to a sociology of\narchitectural worlds, modeled on Becker\u2019s sociology of art\nworlds. \nA problem arises, though, if we look to history or sociology for a\nunified account with common features of an architectural\ndiscipline. While architectural practice has remained stable in\ncertain respects, change over its history greatly limits common\nfeatures, perhaps, to a core set of basic tools and rudimentary\nprinciples of structural engineering. This suggests that, at root, the\npractice of architecture must involve engineering or related\ndesign. But architecture can\u2019t be reduced to a form of\nengineering, if we think architectural ideals, taste, and expertise\ncontribute something over and above engineering facts, rules, and\npractical knowledge. These further contributions suggest an art or\nart-like role for architectural practice. However, the historical\nrecord is mixed on the matter of whether architects are at the same\ntime pursuing art (or what we now consider as art) or should be\nthought of as artists. Moreover, the historical record and resulting\ndisjunctive claim do not address cases where even the most basic tools\nor structural principles are not deployed. Some such cases of not\nobserving basic structural principles, as fantasy architecture, may be\ndeemed marginal; other such cases, as landscape architecture, are\nnot.\nAnother dimension of defining architecture as a practice is\nspecifying the sorts of structures that architects design. At a bare\nminimum, we can say that they feature some connection to human\nuse. But attempts to render this as non-trivial introduce further\npuzzles (see \u00a72.3).\n",
