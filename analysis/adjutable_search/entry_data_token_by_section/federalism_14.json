    "main_text": "Further Philosophical Issues || Democratic Theory\n4.7 Politics of Recognition\n\nMany federal political orders accommodate minority groups in two ways\ndiscussed above: both through a division of power, and by granting\nthem influence over common decisions. These measures of\n identity politics\n can be valuable ways to give public acknowledgment and recognition to\ngroups and their members, sometimes on the very basis of previous\ndomination. But identity politics also create challenges (Gutman\n1994), especially in federal arrangements that face greater risks of\ninstability and must maintain citizens\u2019 dual political\nloyalties. Self-government arrangements may threaten the federal\npolitical order: \u201cdemands for self-government reflect a desire\nto weaken the bonds with the larger community and, indeed, question\nits very nature, authority and permanence\u201d (Kymlicka and Norman\n1994, 375). The emphasis on \u201crecognition and\ninstitutionalization of difference could undermine the conditions that\nmake a sense of common identification and thus mutuality\npossible\u201d (Carens 2000, 193).\n\nFederations are often thought to be sui generis,\none-of-a-kind deviations from the ideal-type unitary sovereign state\nfamiliar from the Westphalian world order. Indeed, every federation\nmay well be federal in its very own way, and not easy to summarize and\nassess as an ideal-type political order. Yet the phenomenon of\nnon-unitary sovereignty is not new, and federal accommodation of\ndifferences may well be better than the alternatives. When and why\nthis is so has long been the subject of philosophical, theoretical and\nnormative analysis and reflection. Such public arguments may\nthemselves contribute to develop the overarching loyalty required\namong citizens of stable, legitimate federations, who must understand\nthemselves as members of two commonwealths.\n",
