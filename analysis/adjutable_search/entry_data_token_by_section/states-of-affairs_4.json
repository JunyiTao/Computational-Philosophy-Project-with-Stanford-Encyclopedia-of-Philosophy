Some philosophers have proposed to use the connection\nbetween states of affairs and modality constructively to explain what\na possible world is.\n\nLewis (1973: 84) points out that we talk about ways things might have\nbeen. He goes on to label ways every thing might have been\n\u201cpossible worlds\u201d. If it is possible that something is the\ncase, there is a possible world in which it is the case. What are,\nthen, possible worlds?\n\nVan Inwagen distinguished between Abstractionist and Concretist\nconceptions of possible worlds (see van Inwagen 1986: 185\u20136; see\nalso Stalnaker 1986: 121). According to a Concretist conception of\npossible worlds such as David Lewis\u2019s, a possible world is the\nmaximal mereological sum of individuals that are spatio-temporally\nrelated and each such sum is spatio-temporally isolated from all\nothers (see Lewis 1986: 69\u201370). There are no impossible worlds.\nThe actual world is the world in which we are located.\n\nAccording to Abstractionists, possible worlds are abstract objects of\nsome sort. The exercise in probability calculation from\n section 1.2\n motivates an Abstractionist proposal in which states of affairs are\nthe basic building blocks. States of affairs are possible outcomes.\nKripke called possible outcomes \u201cminiature possible\nworlds\u201d. This suggests an idea of what a possible world is: it\nis a maximal state of affairs. Pollock (1984a: 57) defines\npossible world therefore as follows:\n\n(PW)\n w is a possible world if, and only if, w is a\nnontransient possible state of affairs and for any nontransient state\nof affairs S if it is possible that w and S both\nobtain, w includes S. (see also Plantinga 1974:\n44\u20136)\n\n\nA state of affairs w includes a state of affairs S if,\nand only if, necessarily if w obtains, S obtains. The\nactual world is the possible maximal nontransient state of affairs\nthat obtains.\n\nA state of affairs is transient if, and only if, it obtains at one\ntime and not another. For instance, the state of affairs\nSocrates\u2019s not drinking hemlock obtains at some times,\nbut not at others. Transient states of affairs are only possible,\nactual etc. relative to a time. Before 399 BC it was possible that\nSocrates does not drink hemlock, but this is no longer possible after\n399 BC. A state of affairs is nontransient if, and only, if it is such\nthat necessarily if it obtains at one time it obtains at all times.\nFor example, the state of affairs Socrates\u2019s being hungry on\nthe 15th of April 400 BC at 16:15 is nontransient.\n\n(PW) makes use of modal concepts to define possible world: it must be\npossible for S and w to both obtain etc. Hence,\nthis particular Abstractionist conception of possible worlds does not\nallow one to explain modality away; it presupposes it. In contrast,\nthe Concretist conception promises a definitional reduction of modal\nconcepts. When we talk about possibility and necessity we quantify\nover mereological sums of things. The concept of modality is not\nrequired to distinguish between possible and impossible worlds: there\nare no impossible ones. Why is (PW), then, attractive?\n\nFirst, Forbes (1987: 139ff) argues that the identification of\npossible worlds with constructions out of compossible states of\naffairs solves the problem of accidental intrinsics (Lewis 1986:\n199\u2013201). Let us consider an intrinsic property of a human\nbeing, say me, such as having two hands. I might have existed\nwithout having had two hands. On the concretist account this implies\nthat there is a possible world in which I have a different number of\nhands. But how can one and the same individual have two as well as\nfewer/more hands \u201cin different worlds\u201d? If the worlds are\nmereological sums that have me as a common part, this seems not\npossible. Lewis concludes that the same object cannot be part of\ndifferent possible worlds. An object can only be in different possible\nworlds by having counterparts in them.\n\nAccording to counterpart theory, I might have had three hands only in\nthe derived sense by having counter-parts that have three hands (see\nKripke 1980: 45). This does not sit well with the intuition that\nI strictly and literally speaking might have had three hands.\nThe identification of possible worlds with constructions out of\ncompossible states of affairs is faithful to this intuition. I have\ndifferent properties in different possible worlds, if the possible\nworlds contain different states of affairs that involve me. One\npossible world contains the state of affairs MT\u2019s having\nthree hands; the possible world that is actual contains the state\nof affairs MT\u2019s having two hands. The different\npossible worlds under discussion don\u2019t overlap, yet the\npossibilities involve me (see Forbes 1987: 141).\n\nSecond, the semantics of counterfactuals. The so-called\n\u201cStalnaker-Lewis semantics\u201d for counterfactuals assumes\nthat a counterfactual such as \u201cIf it were rainy today, I would\ntake an umbrella\u201d is true if, and only if, all of the closest\npossible worlds in which the antecedent is true are possible worlds in\nwhich the consequent is true. This semantics for counterfactuals\nallows the substitution of logically equivalent sentences in the\nantecedent of a counterfactual. For example, if the counterfactual\n\u201cIf it were rainy today, I would take an umbrella\u201d is\ntrue, so is \u201cIf it were rainy and windy today or rainy and not\nwindy today, I would take an umbrella\u201d because \u201cIt is\nrainy today\u201d and \u201cIf it is rainy and windy today or rainy\nand not windy today\u201d are true in the same possible worlds. Fine\n(1975: 453f; 2012: 230f) argues that the substitution principle should\nbe given up in the light of puzzling consequences. But certainly one\ncan substitute some sentences in the antecedent of a counterfactual.\nWhich ones? Fine suggests replacing Stalnaker-Lewis semantics for\ncounterfactuals with a semantics in which possible states take pride\nof place. Instead of a plurality of possible worlds there is a space\nof possible states that involve particulars and ways they can be.\nAssertoric sentences refer to states of affairs and only those\nsentences that refer to the same state of affairs can be substituted\nin the antecedent of a counter-factual (Fine 1975: 454).\n\nFine assumes that \u201cIt is rainy\u201d, \u201cIt is rainy and\nwindy\u201d and \u201cIt is rainy and not windy\u201d etc. refer to\ndifferent states of affairs (1975: 454). How can this assumption be\njustified? If we take the idea that states of affairs are complexes\nseriously, we can answer this question. Just like other complexes they\ncan (at least in part) be individuated in terms of their constituents.\nThe states of affairs \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) can therefore only be the\nsame state of affairs if they have the same constituents. This\nconception allows for states of affairs that necessarily co-obtain,\nbut differ. For example, necessarily, the state of affairs that\ntriangle A is equilateral obtains if the state of affairs that\ntriangle A is equiangular and vice versa. Similarly,\nthe state of affairs P necessarily obtains if, and only if, the\nstate of affairs \\(P \\mathbin{\\&} (Q \\lor \\neg Q)\\) obtains. Yet,\nthese are different states of affairs: they have different\nconstituents.\n\nThis conception of states of affairs as complexes makes them useful\nfor semantics. If sentences refer to such states of affairs, logically\nequivalent sentences can refer to different states of affairs and\ntherefore have different semantic properties. All tautologies are true\nin all possible worlds, yet they can refer to different states of\naffairs. A number of semantic theories assume that sentences refer to\nstates of affairs. These theories provide principles that determine\nthe reference of complex sentences on the basis of their parts (see\nFine 2012: 234; see also Rumfitt 2015: 160\u20137).\n\nHowever, if states of affairs are individuated in terms of their\ncomponents and their mode of combination, there are for every possible\nworld many different maximal nontransient states of affairs (for the\nfollowing see Zalta 1993: 393\u20134). If the state of affairs\nP is a possible world, so is \\(P \\mathbin{\\&} (Q\\lor \\neg\nQ)\\) for an arbitrarily chosen possible state of affairs Q.\nP and \\(P \\mathbin{\\&} (Q\\lor \\neg Q)\\) are necessarily\nequivalent, but, according to our individuation method, different\nstates of affairs. Hence, there are many different maximal states of\naffairs that correspond to the same possible world and, in particular,\nto the actual world.\n\nZalta (1993) tackles this problem on the basis of his axiomatic theory\nof abstract objects. According to him, abstract objects like numbers\nexemplify but also encode properties. For example, 1 encodes the\nproperties that are essential to its identity; to its being the object\nit is. In contrast, 1 exemplifies, but does not encode, the property\nof being the number of inhabited planets of the solar system. In this\nsystem, situations are those abstract objects that encode state of\naffairs properties such as being such that John is to the left of\nHarry. If a situation is the case, the state of affairs\nproperties it encodes obtain; the situation makes the encoded state of\naffairs property factual. A situation S is a possible world if,\nand only if, it is possible that S makes all and only the\nobtaining states of affairs properties factual. On the basis of the\naxioms of his system Zalta can show that there is a unique actual\nworld.\n\nIf one is unwilling to make a distinction between encoding and\nexemplifying, but one wants to maintain the identification of possible\nworlds with maximal possible states of affairs, one either has to\naccept that necessarily equivalent states of affairs are the same or\none must identify possible worlds with sets of necessarily equivalent\npossible states of affairs. We already rejected the first option as\nunfruitful for semantics. The second option seems to result in a\nset-theoretic modeling or replacement of possible worlds, not in a\nconception of possible worlds (see Zalta 1993: 394).\n",
