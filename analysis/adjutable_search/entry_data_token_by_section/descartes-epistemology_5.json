    "main_text": "The Methods: Foundationalism and Doubt || Foundationalism\n2.1 Foundationalism\n\nThe central insight of foundationalism is to organize knowledge in the\nmanner of a well-structured, architectural edifice. Such an edifice\nowes its structural integrity to two kinds of features: a firm\nfoundation and a superstructure of support beams\nfirmly anchored to the foundation. A system of justified beliefs might\nbe organized by two analogous features: a foundation of unshakable\nfirst principles, and a superstructure of further propositions\nanchored to the foundation via unshakable inference.\n\nExemplary of a foundationalist system is Euclid\u2019s geometry.\nEuclid begins with a foundation of first principles \u2013\ndefinitions, postulates, and axioms or common notions \u2013 on\nwhich he then bases a superstructure of further propositions.\nDescartes\u2019 own designs for metaphysical knowledge are inspired\nby Euclid\u2019s system:\n\nThose long chains composed of very simple and easy reasoning,\nwhich geometers customarily use to arrive at their most difficult\ndemonstrations, had given me occasion to suppose that all the things\nwhich can fall under human knowledge are interconnected in the same\nway. (Discourse 2, AT 6:19, CSM 1:120).\n\n\nIt would be misleading to characterize the arguments of the\nMeditations as unfolding straightforwardly according to\ngeometric method (cf. Curley 2006, 31). But Descartes maintains\nthat they can be reconstructed as such, and he expressly\ndoes so at the end of the Second Replies \u2013 providing a\n\u201cgeometrical\u201d exposition of some of his central lines\nof argument, organized as definitions, postulates,\naxioms or common notions, and propositions (AT\n7:160\u201370, CSM 2:113\u2013120).\n\nAs noted above, the Meditations contains a destructive\ncomponent that Descartes likens to the architect\u2019s preparations\nfor laying a foundation. Though the component finds no analogue in the\nmethods of geometers, Descartes appears to hold that it is needed in\nmetaphysical inquiry. The discovery of Euclid\u2019s first principles\n(some of them, at any rate) is comparatively unproblematic: such\nprinciples as that things which are equal to the same thing are\nalso equal to one another accord not only with reason, but with\nthe senses. In contrast, metaphysical inquiry might have first\nprinciples that conflict with the senses:\n\nThe difference is that the primary notions which\nare presupposed for the demonstration of geometrical truths are\nreadily accepted by anyone, since they accord with the use of our\nsenses. Hence there is no difficulty there, except in the proper\ndeduction of the consequences, which can be done even by the less\nattentive, provided they remember what has gone before. \u2026 \nIn metaphysics by contrast there is nothing which causes so much\neffort as making our perception of the primary notions clear and\ndistinct. Admittedly, they are by their nature as evident as, or even\nmore evident than, the primary notions which the geometers study; but\nthey conflict with many preconceived opinions derived from the senses\nwhich we have got into the habit of holding from our earliest years,\nand so only those who really concentrate and meditate and withdraw\ntheir minds from corporeal things, so far as possible, will achieve\nperfect knowledge of them.  (Replies 2, AT 7:156f, CSM 2:111)\n\n\nAmong Descartes\u2019 persistent themes is that such preconceived\nopinions can obscure our mental vision of innate principles:\nwhere there are disputes about first principles, it is not\n\u201cbecause one man\u2019s faculty of knowledge extends more\nwidely than another\u2019s, but because the common notions are in\nconflict with the preconceived opinions of some people who, as a\nresult, cannot easily grasp them\u201d; whereas, \u201cwe cannot\nfail to know them [innate common notions] when the occasion for\nthinking about them arises, provided that we are not blinded by\npreconceived opinions\u201d (Prin. 1:49f, AT 8a:24, CSM\n1:209). These \u201cpreconceived opinions\u201d must be \u201cset\naside,\u201d says Descartes, \u201cin order to lay the first\nfoundations of philosophy\u201d (May 1643 letter to Voetius, AT\n8b:37, CSMK 221). Otherwise, we\u2019re apt to regard, as\nfirst principles, the mistaken (though prima facie obvious) sensory\nclaims that particularists find attractive. Such mistakes in the\nlaying of the foundations weaken the entire edifice. Descartes\nadds:\n\nAll the mistakes made in the sciences happen, in my view, simply\nbecause at the beginning we make judgements too hastily, and accept as\nour first principles matters which are obscure and of which we do not\nhave a clear and distinct notion. (Search, AT 10:526, CSM\n2:419)\n\n\nThough foundationalism brilliantly allows for the expansion of\nknowledge from first principles, Descartes thinks that a complementary\nmethod is needed to help us discover genuine first principles. As\nHatfield writes, \u201cthe problem is not to carry out proofs (which\nmight well be assented to, given the definitions and axioms), but to\ndiscover the axioms themselves (which are hopelessly obscured by the\nprejudices of the senses)\u201d (1986, 71). Descartes therefore\ndevises the method of doubt for this purpose \u2013 a method to help\n\u201cset aside\u201d preconceived opinions.\n\n(For examples of non-foundationist interpretations, see Bennett 1990,\nFrankfurt 1970, Sosa 1997a, and Della Rocca 2011.)\n",
