    "main_text": "Fictionalism in Context || Modal Fictionalism and Fiction\n2.1 Modal Fictionalism and Fiction\n\nA theory that holds that possible worlds are to be treated as having\nthe status of fictional objects immediately gives rise to questions\nabout the status of fictions and fictional objects more generally. The\nissue of how to understand the \u201caccording to the\nfiction\u2026\u201d operator has already been mentioned. Other\nissues in the treatment of fiction are the question of whether\n\u201ctheoretical\u201d fictions are to be seen in the same light as\nliterary fictions, and the question of what ontological status\nfictions possess.\n\nThere is room in principle to distinguish claims about\nparadigmatically fictional characters (like Sherlock Holmes or\nhobbits) from the treatment one wishes to apply to claims which serve\nuseful theoretical purposes but which are not to be taken literally,\nor at least not at face value: to distinguish \u201cfabulous\u201d\nand \u201cfictional\u201d entities, to use Bentham\u2019s not\nentirely perspicuous terminology (Bentham 1959). One might wish to do\nthis, for example, if one thought that paradigmatic story-telling\nconsisted of utterances that were not truth-apt (not anyway through\nthe same mechanism as ordinary utterances), while claims about, say,\nideal gases were better construed as standard sorts of assertions that\nwere literally false. In practice, however, recent modal fictionalism\ndiscussions have proceeded as if the theory holds that possible worlds\nare fictional in the fullest sense of the word.\n\nThe ontological status of fictions is an important issue to settle if\nwe are to determine whether modal fictionalism is any advance\nmetaphysically on rival realist theories of possible worlds. On pain\nof circularity, the ontology of fiction, as conceived by the\nfictionalist, had best not include possible worlds (as the ontology of\nfiction offered in Lewis 1978 does), but there are other sources of\nconcern. Rosen points out that fictionalists must believe in fictions,\nstories, theories, or somesuch, and that if these are construed as\nabstract objects, they will not be philosophically uncontroversial\n(Rosen 1990, p. 338). Rosen argues that belief in abstract objects\nlike stories and theories is less revisionary than belief in Lewisian\npossible worlds, at least. However, it is hardly clear that an\nontology of abstract representational entities is any more or less\nobjectionable than the ontology of abstractionist theories of possible\nworlds. (Lycan 1993, p. 16, Nolan 1997a, pp. 271\u2013273).\nAlternatively, fictionalists could commit themselves to more concrete,\n\u201cnominalistically respectable\u201d fictions only: the relevant\nfictions or theories of possible worlds might be conceived of only as\nink-marks on pieces of paper, or information states inside brains, or\nperhaps as some amalgam of these and other actual, concrete ontology.\nThis approach is not problem-free either (see section 4): it is far\nfrom clear that it will serve as a basis for paradigm fictions, let\nalone be enough to explain possible worlds.\n",
