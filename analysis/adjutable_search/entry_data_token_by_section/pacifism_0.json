    "main_text": "Defining Peace\n1. Defining Peace\n\nPacifism is the broad commitment to making peace. The idea is\ncomplicated by the fact that peace is a family resemblance term: there\nare many varieties of peace. Peace is easiest to define dialectically\nas the opposite of war or violence. Pacifism has thus been described\nsimply as anti-warism or as commitment to nonviolence. One conceptual\ndifficulty here is that when peace is defined negatively, pacifism\nappears as a reactionary response to war and violence. Discussions of\npeace thus often employ negative terms and creative neologisms to\nexpress the concept of peace: \u201cnonviolence,\u201d\n\u201cnonwar,\u201d \u201cnonkilling,\u201d\n\u201cnonconflict,\u201d or \u201cnonwar.\u201d Peace advocates\nwill however insist that peace should be understood as a primary\nconcept connected to cooperation, harmony, and positive human\nrelations and that it is a mistake to understand peace in merely\nnegative terms (see Fox 2014). At any rate, peace scholarship has long\nemphasized the distinction between negative peace and\npositive peace: negative peace is the absence of violence or\nwar while positive peace encompasses cooperative, tranquil, and\nharmonious relations and the broader concerns of human flourishing and\nintegration (see Galtung 1969; Boersema 2017). A related distinction\nis that between what Sims et al (2014) call \u201cpersonal\npeacefulness,\u201d involving small groups of people, and peace at a\nlarger international scale, up to and including \u201cworld peace\u201d (see\nBellamy 2019).\n\nWhen pacifism is defined as anti-warism, we encounter the difficulty\nof defining war. War is usually thought of as violence between states\nor, more broadly speaking, political communities. But the term\n\u201cwar\u201d can also be applied to violent conflicts among\nindividuals, as in Hobbes\u2019 idea that the state of nature is a\nstate of war. Similarly, although peace is usually thought of as a\npolitical condition of amicable relations between states, terms like\n\u201cpeace\u201d or \u201cpeaceful\u201d can also be used to\ndescribe a relation between individuals or even a person\u2019s state\nof mind.\n\nIf pacifism is defined as a commitment to nonviolence, we encounter\nthe same problem of definition. Violence usually has a normative value\nand is defined as something like \u201can unjustified injury or\nharm.\u201d But it is possible to speak of justified\nviolence\u2014as in the just war theory. And so, the normative value\nof violence remains an open question. The concept of violence can also\nbe extended metaphorically and used as an\nadjective\u2014\u201cviolent\u201d\u2014to mean something like\nunbridled, uncontrolled, rough, or intense. Thus we speak of\n\u201cviolent storms\u201d or \u201cviolent emotions.\u201d A\ncommitment to nonviolence is, at least, a commitment to avoiding\nunjustified intentional injury. Pacifists will tend to think that most\nintentionally caused harms are unjustifiable. But the ideal of\nnonviolence might be extended to include the idea of controlling rough\nand intense emotions. In his essay, \u201cJourney to\nNonviolence,\u201d for example, Martin Luther King Jr. claimed that a\ncommitment to nonviolence required overcoming the \u201cinternal\nviolence\u201d of hatred and anger by cultivating love and compassion\n(King 1986, 46).\n\nThere are a variety of possibilities for thinking about the nature of\npeace and thus for understanding what pacifism aims at creating.\n",
