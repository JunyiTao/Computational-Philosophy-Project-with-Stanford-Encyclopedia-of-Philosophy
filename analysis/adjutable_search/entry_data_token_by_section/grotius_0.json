    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nPrison escapee, high-stakes politician, shipwreck survivor, Grotius\nwas a remarkable man who led a remarkable life. Born on 10 April 1583\nin Delft, Holland\u2014Easter Sunday, as his biographers invariably\nnote\u2014his family was moderately prosperous, well-educated and\nambitious. From these nourishing if not particularly distinguished\norigins, Grotius soon proved himself exceptional. When he was eight,\nhe began writing skillful elegies in Latin; by eleven, he was a\nstudent in the Faculty of Letters at the University of Leiden. In\n1598, at the tender age of fifteen, he accompanied the leading Dutch\npolitician of the day, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, on an embassy to the\nroyal court of France. There King Henry IV, impressed by his\nextraordinary learnedness, hailed him as \u201cthe miracle of\nHolland\u201d. And three years later, when the United Provinces\ndecided to reinforce their autonomy from Spain by retaining an\nofficial Latin historiographer to chronicle their history, they chose\nGrotius over Dominicus Baudius, a full professor of rhetoric at\nLeiden, for the position.\n\nIn the small world of Dutch high society, Grotius had clearly been\nidentified as a young man going places. While in France, he had earned\n(or possibly just bought) a law degree from the University of\nOrl\u00e9ans. After returning to The Hague, he established a law\npractice and within a short time, his clientele included\nOldenbarnevelt, the Dutch East India Company (V.O.C.) and Prince\nMaurice of Nassau. Apparently he impressed Maurice, for when the\nposition of Attorney General of Holland, Zeeland and West Friesland\nbecame available in 1607, the Prince chose him over two other older\nand more experienced candidates. Grotius didn\u2019t particularly\nenjoy the practice of law\u2014in letters he voiced complaints\nfamiliar to today\u2019s lawyers, bemoaning the tedium of the work\nand obstreperous clients\u2014so he closed his firm upon being made\nAttorney General. Perhaps capitalizing on his new position and the\nhealthy salary it paid, he soon married the redoubtable Maria van\nReigersbergen, with whom he would eventually have three daughters and\nfour sons.\n\nAfter several years as Attorney General, Grotius was appointed\nPensionary (roughly equivalent to Governor of an American state) of\nRotterdam in 1613. That same year, he was called to put theory into\npractice when a dispute arose between the English and the Dutch over\nthe freedom of the seas. The details are interesting but complicated:\nin essence, on the basis of the claim that two Dutch vessels were\ntrespassing on seas owned by England near Greenland, a small British\nfleet seized the contents of the Dutch ships. Grotius led a delegation\nto England in protest of the English actions. While history may have\nfavored Grotius\u2014his view that the seas are open to all would\neventually come to be international law\u2014real politick made\nvictory impossible for him at the time. The English were more powerful\nthan the Dutch, and they neither returned the cargo nor conceded the\nlegal point.\n\n1613 may have carried some excitement but the end of the decade was\none of the true zeniths (or nadirs, depending on one\u2019s\nperspective) of Grotius\u2019 life. A dispute between orthodox\nCalvinists and reformers over arcane theological matters which no\nlonger seem important to us quickly assumed enormous political\nsignificance. Grotius, Oldenbarnevelt and other supporters of\nreligious tolerance were aligned on the side with the reformers or\n\u201cRemonstrants\u201d; Maurice, the Calvinist establishment and\nother so-called \u201cContra-Remonstrants\u201d were on the other.\nOn 29 August 1618, Maurice and his allies staged a coup, overthrowing\nthe States General (of which Grotius was a member by virtue of his\nposition as Pensionary of Rotterdam) and imprisoning him along with\nOldenbarnevelt and Rombout Hoogerbeets, the Pensionary of Leiden.\nConsolidating his grip on power, Maurice soon moved to eliminate the\nRemonstrants and their supporters in government; as part of this\nputsch, Oldenbarnevelt was executed and Grotius and Hoogerbeets were\nsentenced to life imprisonment. It would be overly dramatic to say\nGrotius languished there: he was allowed to correspond with outsiders;\nmoreover, he had books and writing materials, and indeed he composed\nmuch important work during this time. But the cold and damp cell was\nfar from pleasant and there was the looming danger that the\nauthorities would revisit his case and impose an even harsher\npunishment. So in March 1621, Grotius and his wife Maria decided\nenough was enough. Placing himself in a large trunk that Maria had\nshipped to him, Grotius escaped prison by having the trunk carried out\non the pretense that it contained a number of books. He fled to\nAntwerp and thence to Paris, where his family eventually joined\nhim.\n\nNow began a more stable and productive period. The French authorities\nwelcomed Grotius by awarding him an annual pension which, while not\nalways paid, at least gave the promise of security. He began\ncomposition of De iure belli ac pacis (On the law of war\nand peace), which was published by a Parisian press in 1625. It\nquickly made Grotius famous: for example, in a letter to Grotius,\nVossius says that Descartes told him that he had recently met the\nDutchman (in reply, Grotius wrote that he didn\u2019t remember\nmeeting Descartes, an indication of their relative stature at the\ntime). Perhaps encouraged by the reception of his work, Grotius tried\nreturning to the Netherlands in 1631. Initially, he may have had\nreason to be optimistic: after practicing law for a little while in\nAmsterdam, he was offered the Governor Generalship of the V.O.C. in\nAsia. Soon enough, however, the authorities moved against him, placing\na large price on his head and forcing him in April 1632 to flee his\nhome country. Grotius would never set foot there again.\n\nThis time, he went to Hamburg, Germany. Nearby Sweden (one of the\nsuperpowers of the day) had numerous connections to the city, which\nmade it quite natural for Swedish authorities to notice the presence\nand availability for hire of such a luminary. Moving to take advantage\nof the situation, they made him their Ambassador to France in 1634.\nGrotius began his diplomatic duties in Paris the following year. It is\nhard to gauge his success as ambassador: while he did help to\nnegotiate a treaty which led to the end of the Thirty Years\u2019\nWar, he could also be outmaneuvered in the diplomatic game\u2014at\none point, his bumbling forced the Swedish Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna\nto come to Paris and sort things out. Still, such stories\nnotwithstanding, it is true that he lasted ten years in one of the\nhighest and most demanding diplomatic postings of his day.\n\nDuring this time, Grotius returned to the theological issues which had\nearlier caused him such grief. The project of Christian\nunity\u2014harmonizing both the various Protestant factions and the\nProtestants with the Catholics\u2014became increasingly important to\nhim. Both intellectually and practically, it was a task which suited\nhim and his place in life: intellectually, because Christian unity\nraised many conceptual puzzles which challenged his mind; practically,\nbecause as ambassador for one of the great European powers, he could\nuse his position to press the cause. Of course, the cause was doomed\nto failure\u2014certainly, it was well beyond Grotius\u2019\nabilities. Yet, it did lead him to write some extremely interesting\nand influential works, many of which were collected in his Opera\nOmnia Theologica.\n\nAfter Queen Christina ascended to the throne in 1644, she\nsystematically began to undermine her rival Oxenstierna and\u2014as\npart of this infighting\u2014recalled Grotius from his\nambassadorship. She didn\u2019t fire him; instead, she instructed him\nto come to Stockholm and assume a different position. At first,\nGrotius didn\u2019t want to go, but bowing to the force of royal\nprerogative (not to mention economic necessity), he set sail for\nStockholm in March 1645. It was a fateful decision: traveling\nconditions on the Baltic in late winters can be harsh; his ship\nwrecked and Grotius barely escaped with his life. After spending a few\nmonths in Sweden, he decided to return to Germany and so undertook\nanother voyage. Again, conditions were poor; it took eight long days\nto cross the relatively narrow stretch of water. This time, it was too\nmuch: weakened by recent events, Grotius died on 28 August 1645, in\nRostock, Germany. While they are probably apocryphal, his supposed\nlast words\u2014\u201cBy attempting many things, I have accomplished\nnothing\u201d\u2014do evoke the span of his life\u2019s work and\nhis personal assessment of the results.\n",
