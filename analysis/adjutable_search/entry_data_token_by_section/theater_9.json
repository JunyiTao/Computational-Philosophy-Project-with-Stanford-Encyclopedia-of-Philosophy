    "main_text": "Evaluating a Theatrical Performance || Aesthetic and Artistic Evaluations\n4.2 Aesthetic and Artistic Evaluations\n\nThe second major question about evaluation concerns whether there are\nany non-aesthetic artistic values. Behaviorally there is a clear\ndifference between aesthetic and non-aesthetic artistic values,\nindicated by the fact that appeals to aesthetic responses do not\nexplain many individual\u2019s interest in works of art (Carroll\n1986b; Stecker 2006). There is disciplinary support for a distinction\nhere: the study of the felt quality of perceptions of the senses is\nconducted by cognitive scientists and neuroscientists, while the study\nof the historical practices of art making are studied by\nanthropologists and art-historians. But this behavioral way of\nremarking the distinction still needs an explanation. We might explain\nthis distinction by appeal to a metaphysical difference between\naesthetic properties and artistic properties. Robert Stecker\u2019s\nepistemic way of explaining the distinction is by means of proposing a\n\u201ctest\u201d\u2014as he calls it\u2014for whether an\nevaluative verdict regarding a work of art appeals to an aesthetic or\nan artistic value:\n\n\nartistic value derives from what artists successfully intend to do\nin their works as mediated by functions of the art forms and\ngenres to which the works belong. [So] does one need to understand the\nwork to appreciate its being valuable in that way? If so, it is an\nartistic value. If not, it is not. (Stecker 2012: 357)\n\n\nThis position has had its detractors (Lopes 2011; Dodd 2013), but\nsomething quite like it has also had defenders who have argued, for\nexample, against the view of \u201cappreciation as liking\u201d and\nin favor of \u201cappreciation as sizing up\u201d (Carroll 2016).\nEach of these notions of appreciation appeals to David Hume\u2019s\nclaim that \u201cgood sense\u201d is necessary for avoiding\nprejudice and for being able to discern the relevant features of a\nwork. But, as Hume saw, good sense is not essential to what Carroll\ncalls \u201cappreciation as liking\u201d. Whereas, Carroll notes, it\nis both essential and crucial to \u201cappreciation as sizing\nup\u201d.\n\nThe crucial thing to notice about this distinction between aesthetic\nand artistic value is that it moves us away from thinking of the value\nof a work of art as residing in the experience it might provide us (a\nview that David Davies has called \u201caesthetic empiricism\u201d)\nand suggests, at the very least, that we do not look only to\nexperience for the source of values in a work of art. One place to\nlook is suggested by the position of Stecker himself, who requires\nwhat he calls \u201cunderstanding\u201d a work of art by means of\nexamining \n\n\nwhat artists successfully intend to do in their works as\nmediated by functions of the art forms and genres to which the works\nbelong. (Stecker 2012: 357) \n\n\nOr we might look at what No\u00ebl Carroll has called \u201can\nappreciative heuristic applied to art\u201d which requires one to\n\n\n\n1) identify [a work of art\u2019s] intended purpose or purposes and\n2) determine the adequacy or appropriateness of its form\u2014its\nformal choices\u2014to the realization or articulation of its\nintended purpose (or purposes). (Carroll 2016: 4\u20135) \n\n\nEach of these suggestions hold that artistic evaluations are\nassessments of the artistic achievements that the work has\nmade. And we might propose that aesthetic evaluations of the\nvery same works (and much else in the world as well) could turn out to\nbe, as Paul Ziff has argued, the registration of preferences for\nthe experiences provided by the work (or other object) (Ziff 1979\n[1984]). This analysis already seems to be adopted by Stecker (2006)\nin what he calls the \u201cbroad\u201d analysis of aesthetic\npleasure, which he endorses.\n\nIf we follow Ziff\u2019s suggestion about aesthetic verdicts, then\njust about anything could be grounds for aesthetic\nevaluations of a theatrical performance. But Ziff\u2019s suggestion\nmay not be the right idea about aesthetic verdicts. According to\nJerrold Levinson, Hume appealed to what he called \u201cideal\njudges\u201d to resolve the puzzling conflict between the fact that\nthere are demonstrably better and worse artworks and the fact that our\ntastes\u2014what we prefer\u2014differ with respect to works of art\n(Hume 1757). Levinson, who refines and defends Hume\u2019s solution\nto this conflict, notes that if we have good reason to appeal to\n\u201cideal critics\u201d, who possess good taste and who can\ndiscern which objects are worthy of aesthetic attention, both of the\nfact claims that appear to be in conflict could turn out to be true.\nAnd there are real advantages in Hume\u2019s solution: it seems to\nsquare with the fact we are able to learn from others, others whose\njudgment we trust, and so whose good taste should lead us to choose\nthe right works of art; and it also squares with the fact we do seem\nto acquire \u201ctaste\u201d from following the judgments of others\nwhom we trust.\n\nThe \u201cideal critics\u201d solution has its problems, however.\nBriefly they concern three things. First, does the artistic\nappreciation of a work of art depend on first-hand acquaintance with\nthat work of art? Whether there is independent empirical evidence that\nthis appeal\u2014to the need for first person experience in order to\nsupport any verdictive judgment\u2014is a vexed problem. Second, how\ndoes the ideal critic come to her/his views in the first place? It is\neither by a process of learning from others whom they regard\nas ideal critics or it is by a process independent of the existence of\nideal critics. If the latter, then we don\u2019t need the\n\u201cideal critics;\u201d all we have to do is undergo that\nindependent process ourselves. If the former, then we have a either a\n\u201cvicious infinite regress\u201d with no rational starting place\nin the chain or we rely on the testimony of others (which in this area\nis also vexed). And, third, what is the case for the claim that there\nare \u201cideal judges\u201d in the first place (Ross\n2008)? Is there any reason to believe there are any?\n\nThe attractiveness of Ziff\u2019s point of view is that it allows for\na quite different form of solution to the puzzle created by our two\nfacts, one that gives each fact a different kind of explanation. The\nfirst claim\u2014that there are demonstrably better and worse\nartworks\u2014asserts the artistic merits of a work of art\nby reference to the achievements made or not made in the\nparticular work of art. Whether such achievements are or are not made\nin the work is an objective question of fact, and so could be made on\nbehalf of everyone. The second claim\u2014that our tastes differ with\nrespect to works of art\u2014asserts the aesthetic value of\na particular work of art to some individual or group on the basis of\nthe aesthetic qualities that that individual or group\nprefers. Since preferences are usually subjective or\nsometimes inter-subjective, these assessments are made only on behalf\nof particular individuals or groups.\n\nOne advantage of this solution is that it squares with our standard\nways of dealing with the lack of artistic value of forgeries.\nFor, despite the fact forgeries may provide more\n\u201cappreciative experiences worth having\u201d than even the\noriginals may, they may still be objectively less valuable, in the\nsame way that a piece of property may be less valuable, from a\nrealtor\u2019s point of view, than some potential homeowners think it\nis because they feel a preference to own it (Carroll 2016). Another\nadvantage is that it also squares with everyday kinds of remark about\nthe aesthetic value of some works of art being \u201cmerely\nopinions\u201d, because those comments are explicitly about what we\nlike, and are not really about what is better or worse. Claims that\nare genuinely about what is better or worse in a work of art rest on\nconsiderations of the achievements in them, not on our varying\npreferences for or against them. Moreover, this solution is better\npositioned to explain why some works of art do not even aim to provide\nhigh-quality aesthetic experiences. And, finally, it results in no\ncontradiction between either finding that a work is good but not to\none\u2019s liking or finding that a work is bad but is something one\nreally likes, for example a so-called \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d\n(Carroll 2016).\n\nApplied to theatrical performances the distinction between aesthetics\nand artistry seems solid enough even if we have no final determination\nof how to explain the distinction. Yet, no matter how we work that\nout, it seems that spectators and critics will need to provide and\nexplain a rather complicated set of things; for now it appears they\nmust provide both aesthetic and artistic evaluations. This is\nmade more complicated in those cases in which the artistic\nachievements a work makes do consist in provision of\npreferred experiences. Moreover, focusing just on the artistic\nappreciation of theatrical performances and accepting the achievement\nstory about what the artistic value of a work of art is, there are\nstill two further tasks. If theatrical texts and performances are\nworks belonging to different forms of art, then artistic evaluations\nof theater will still come in two kinds, namely, the achievements of\ndramatic texts, and the achievements of performances.\n",
