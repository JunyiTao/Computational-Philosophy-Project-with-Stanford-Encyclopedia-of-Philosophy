Objectivity as Freedom from Personal Biases\n\nThis section deals with scientific objectivity as a form of\nintersubjectivity\u2014as freedom from personal biases. According to\nthis view, science is objective to the extent that personal biases are\nabsent from scientific reasoning, or that they can be eliminated in a\nsocial process. Perhaps all science is necessarily perspectival.\nPerhaps we cannot sensibly draw scientific inferences without a host\nof background assumptions, which may include assumptions about values.\nPerhaps all scientists are biased in some way. But objective\nscientific results do not, or so the argument goes, depend on\nresearchers\u2019 personal preferences or experiences\u2014they are\nthe result of a process where individual biases are gradually filtered\nout and replaced by agreed upon evidence. That, among other things, is\nwhat distinguishes science from the arts and other human activities,\nand scientific knowledge from a fact-independent social construction\n(e.g., Haack 2003).\n\nParadigmatic ways to achieve objectivity in this sense are measurement\nand quantification. What has been measured and quantified has been\nverified relative to a standard. The truth, say, that the Eiffel Tower\nis 324 meters tall is relative to a standard unit and conventions\nabout how to use certain instruments, so it is neither aperspectival\nnor free from assumptions, but it is independent of the person making\nthe measurement.\n\nWe will begin with a discussion of objectivity, so conceived, in\nmeasurement, discuss the ideal of \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d\nand then investigate to what extent freedom from personal biases can\nbe implemented in statistical evidence and inductive\ninference\u2014arguably the core of scientific reasoning, especially\nin quantitatively oriented sciences. Finally, we discuss\nFeyerabend\u2019s radical criticism of a rational scientific method\nthat can be mechanically applied, and his defense of the epistemic and\nsocial benefits of personal \u201cbias\u201d and idiosyncrasy.\n",
