    "main_text": "The Foundation and Anti-Foundation Axioms || The Anti-Foundation Axiom\n2.3 The Anti-Foundation Axiom\n\nThe Anti-Foundation Axiom AFA is stated as follows:\n\n\n Every graph has a unique decoration.\n\n\nThe theory ZFA is ZFC with FA  replaced by AFA.\nIt includes the Axiom of Choice, even though there is no \u201cC\u201d in the \nacronym.\n\n\nThe coiterative conception of set.\nAFA gives rise to, or reflects, a conception of set that is at odds\nwith the iterative conception.   For lack of a better name, we call it\nthe coiterative conception.    According to this, a set is an abstract\nstructure obtained by taking a graph G \n(a set with a relation  on it),\nand then associating to each node x in the graph a set in such a way that\nthe set associated to x is the set of sets associated to the children of x\nin G .    This association is what we called decoration earlier.\n This association might be thought of procedurally, but it need not be\nso construed.   One can instead posit a harmony between decoration\nand power sets.[9]\n\nWhat changes with AFA, and what does not change?.  \n AFA gives us unique solutions to systems of set systems;\nthis is almost immediate from the axiom and the close relation of set systems\nand graphs.    But it also gives us unique solutions for stream systems and tree systems.\nThe details of this are suggested by our work on the decoration of \n the graph related to streams and pairs which we saw\nearlier on.\n\n\nAll of the results in set theory which\ndo not use FA go through when one replaces it by AFA.  In particular, \nthe following topics are unchanged: Russell\u2019s Paradox  and the Separation\n(Subset) Axioms;\nthe modeling of ordered pairs, relations and functions; \nthe natural numbers, real numbers, etc.;  well-orderings and the ordinal numbers;\ntransfinite recursion on well-orders and well-founded relations;\nthe Axiom of Choice; problems and results concerning the sizes of infinite sets.\nThe only difference would be in modeling questions for circularly defined objects of various\nsorts,\nas we have been discussing\nthem.    \n\n\nIn terms of modeling circularity, AFA gives several new concepts\nand techniques.   These are described in our next section.\n\n",
