In partial defense of DSM-type\nclassifications, Elizabeth Lalumera points out that mental disorders\nmay correspond to theoretically informed and thus far incompletely\nunderstood concepts, in contrast to descriptive\nconceptions sufficient for identification practices in\ndiagnosis and care (Lalumera 2016)\n\nResearch-related concerns have led to the issuance of new, dimensional\ncriteria by which the research domain is to be approached (Revised\nDomain Criteria, or RDoC). Separate units of analysis (genes, cells,\ncircuits, self reports, etc.) are each employed in specific research\ndomains (such as positive and negative valence systems, cognitive\nsystems, systems for social processes, and arousal/regulatory\nsystems), and the intersections of units of analysis with research\ndomains produce segments of a spectrum linking normal and atypical\nfeatures. Whether RDoC\u2019s goals are entirely compatible has been\nquestioned, but the aim here is to promote both more accurate research\nand more effective treatments (Cuthbert & Insel 2013; Perring\n2016; Morris, Sanislow et. al. 2022). And while answering some of the\nconcerns about the earlier classificatory model, RDoC has in its turn\nbeen criticized: for its conception of validity; its assumptions about\nthe uniformity of normal distributions; its continuing acceptance of\nclinical and medical presuppositions assigning disorder to the\nindividual rather than the broader social context; its finding little\nplace for personal agency, and assuming a traditional, individualistic\nand autonomous model of self challenged by today\u2019s philosophical\nanalyses.
