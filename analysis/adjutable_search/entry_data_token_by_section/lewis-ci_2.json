    "main_text": "Logic and Language\n3. Logic and Language\n\nIn SSL Lewis (1918) surveyed and discussed developments in symbolic\nlogic from Leibniz to his own day and followed his discussion of\nsystems of material implication with a penultimate chapter presenting\nhis own system of strict implication (omitted from the 1960 Dover\nreprint). In the concluding chapter (also omitted from the 1960 Dover\nreprint), Lewis distinguished three possible types of \u201clogistic\nprocedure\u201d and resultant system (Lewis 1918, 354\u201362,\n367\u201372). The first restricts proofs in mathematics to special\ncases of the propositions of symbolic logic, but grants branches of\nmathematics their own primitive or undefined ideas and postulates\ndistinct from those of symbolic logic. The second goes further,\nreducing mathematics to symbolic logic by defining or analyzing the\nideas and postulates of the former in terms of those of the latter.\nHowever, the third \u201cheterodox\u201d or \u201cexternal\u201d\nconception of mathematics \u2013 \u201cmathematics without\nmeaning\u201d \u2013 treats mathematical and logical systems alike\nas purely formal, abstract systems performing operations on\nrecognizable ideographic marks and strings of marks in ways that are\nindependent of what they denote or mean, or even the type of thing\nthey are interpreted as standing for, e.g. concept or proposition, and\nthus independent of the truth of strings of marks. What matters\ninstead are simply the types of order and relation with which\nrecognizable marks or complexes of marks are distributed and\n\u201cextra-logical\u201d rules or principles for manipulating them,\nlike the consistent substitution of marks for marks within a string of\nmarks. Post (1921) credited Lewis as the first to make substitution an\nexplicit rule for logic, whether under an orthodox conception as with\nhis system of strict implication (Lewis 1918, 295) between\npropositions, or under a heterodox conception concerning recognizable\nmarks and their order (Lewis 1918, 355,358), and cited Lewis\u2019\ndiscussion of the heterodox conception as a stimulus for his own\nformalist research.\n\nLewis was dissatisfied with the extensional truth functional logic\nPrincipia Mathematica, and with its understanding of\nimplication as material implication, according to which the truth of\nthe if-then conditional \\(p \\supset q\\) expressing the\nmaterial implication of \\(q\\) by \\(p\\) is a function just of\nthe truth or falsity of \\(p\\) and \\(q. p \\supset q\\) is equivalent to \\({\\sim}(p \\amp{\\sim}q)\\) and is\ntrue just in case it isn\u2019t the case both that \\(p\\) is true\nand \\(q\\) is false. As a result, among the theses of\nPrincipia Mathematica are \\(p \\supset(q \\supset p)\\) and \\({\\sim}p \\supset(p \\supset q)\\). In\nother words, a true proposition, whatever it happens to be, is implied\nby any proposition whatsoever, true or false, and a false proposition,\nwhatever it happens to be, implies any proposition whatsoever, true or\nfalse. Lewis didn\u2019t deny these theses, properly understood\nrelative to the definition of material implication. However, he did\nthink that these so-called \u201cparadoxes of material\nimplication\u201d meant that material implication doesn\u2019t\nprovide a proper understanding of any ordinary notion of implication,\naccording to which one proposition implies another just in case the\nlatter logically follows from and is deducible from the former.\n\nTo explicate this notion he defined strict implication, according to\nwhich the if-then conditional \\(p \\fishhook q\\)\nexpressing the strict implication of \\(q\\) by \\(p\\) is\nequivalent to \\({\\sim}\\Diamond(p \\amp{\\sim}q)\\), and is true just\nin case it is not possible that \\(p\\) is true and \\(q\\) is\nfalse. Strict implication is an intensional notion, and the logic of\nstrict implication is a form of modal logic. The system of strict\nimplication developed in SSL (Lewis 1918) was distinguished from\nearlier modal logics by its axiomatic presentation in the light of the\nwork of Whitehead and Russell. However, Lewis faced a number of\ncriticisms, including one by Emil Post that one of Lewis\u2019\npostulates led to the result that it was indeed impossible that\n\\(p\\) just in case it was false that \\(p\\), so that\nLewis\u2019 SSL system reduced to an extensional one. Lewis (Lewis\nand Langford 1932) eliminated these problems in SL and provided\ndistinct systems of strict implication or modal logic, S1\u2013S5,\neach stronger than its predecessor (with S3 the system of SSL). S1\ncontained the following axioms:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n& (p \\amp q) \\fishhook(q \\amp p) \\\\\n&(p \\amp q) \\fishhook p \\\\\n&p \\fishhook(p \\amp p) \\\\\n&((p \\amp q) \\amp r) \\fishhook (p \\amp(q \\amp r)) \\\\\n&((p \\fishhook q) \\amp(q \\fishhook r)) \\fishhook(p \\fishhook r) \\\\\n&(p \\amp(p \\fishhook q)) \\fishhook q\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nS2 adds to S1 the consistency postulate\n\n\\[\n\\Diamond(p \\amp q) \\fishhook \\Diamond p,\n\\]\n\n\nwhich allows one to show that if \\(p \\fishhook q\\) is a\ntheorem, then so is \\({\\sim}\\Diamond{\\sim}p \\fishhook{\\sim}\\Diamond{\\sim}q\\),\ni.e., \\(\\Box p \\fishhook \\Box q\\), expressing the\nstrict implication of the necessity of \\(q\\) by the necessity of\n\\(p\\). S3 adds to S1 the postulate\n\n\\[\n(p \\fishhook q) \\fishhook({\\sim}\\Diamond q \\fishhook{\\sim}\\Diamond p)\n\\]\n\n\nS4 adds to S1 the iterative axiom:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&{\\sim}\\Diamond{\\sim}p \\fishhook{\\sim}\\Diamond{\\sim}{\\sim}\\Diamond{\\sim}p, \\text{ i.e.,} \\\\\n&\\Box p \\fishhook \\Box \\Box p\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nS5 adds to S1 the iterative axiom:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\Diamond p \\fishhook{\\sim}\\Diamond{\\sim}\\Diamond p, \\text{ i.e.,} \\\\\n&\\Diamond p \\fishhook \\Box \\Diamond p\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nCritics objected that strict implication posed its own alleged\nparadoxes. Within Lewis\u2019 systems S2\u2013S5, a necessarily true\nproposition is strictly implied by any proposition whatsoever, and a\nnecessarily false proposition strictly implies any proposition\nwhatsoever. However, Lewis (Lewis and Langford 1932) replied in SL\nthat these alleged paradoxes are simply the result of entirely natural\nassumptions about valid deductive inference and entailment quite apart\nfrom the systems of strict implication, and thus are not a problem for\nthe claim that strict implication provides an explication of\ndeducibility and entailment. (The presentation in this and the\nprevious two paragraphs owes much to the excellent account and\ndiscussion of Lewis\u2019 systems of strict implication in Hughes and\nCresswell (1968, Chapters 12\u201313).)\n\nLewis thought that there are an unlimited number of possible systems\nof logic. One example is the extensional propositional calculus of\nPrincipia according to which there are two truth values, true\nand false; other examples are the various systems of many valued logic\nthat Lewis surveyed in SL, and, of course, Lewis\u2019 own various\nmodal systems S1\u2013S5. Lewis thought that each of these systems is\nvalid so long as it is internally consistent. The principles of the\nvarious alternatives simply define the meaning of the logical concepts\nand operators such as negation, truth/falsity, disjunction,\nimplication, and thus they are all true (Lewis 1932, in Lewis 1970,\n401). Bivalent systems simply have a different notion of truth and\nfalsity from non-bivalent ones. Nonetheless, some systems may accord\nbetter than others with notions of truth or implication or deduction\nthat are implicit in our everyday reasoning. Logics can thus be\nassessed pragmatically by their sufficiency for the guidance and\ntesting of our usual deductions, systematic simplicity and\nconvenience, and accord with our psychological limitations and mental\nhabits. However, Lewis denied that he was claiming that principles of\nlogic could be true without being necessarily true, or necessarily\ntrue without being necessarily necessary. A logic in which\n\\(\\Box p \\fishhook \\Box \\Box p\\) holds simply\noperates with a different notion of necessity from one in which it\ndoesn\u2019t.\n\nLewis (1946, Chps. 3, 6) distinguished several modes of meaning in\nAKV. The denotation of a term is the class of actual things\nto which the term applies and is distinct from the\ncomprehension \u2014 the class of possible or consistently\nthinkable things to which it applies. The signification of a\nterm is the property the presence of which in a thing makes the term\napplicable, and the intension or connotation of a\nterm is what is applicable to any possible thing to which the term is\napplicable. Intension can be linguistic intension or meaning, in which\ncase it is the conjunction of terms applicable to any possible thing\nto which the term is applicable and thus substitutable for the term\nsalva veritate. However, since definitions must have criteria\nof application and these must ultimately be non-circular, the more\nbasic dimension of intension is sense meaning. Sense meaning\nis the criterion in mind in terms of sense experience for classifying\nobjects and applying a term-- a schema or rule that speakers have in\nmind whereby a term applies to an actual or thinkable thing or\nsignifies some property, and which would exist even if there were no\nlinguistic expression for it.\n\nSince linguistic intension is implicitly holistic and verbal\ndefinition eventually circular, Lewis (1929, 107) said in MWO that\nlogical analysis isn\u2019t reduction to primitive terms, but is a\nmatter of relating terms to each other. Concepts consist in relational\nstructures of meaning. They require criteria of application in\nexperience and the total meaning of a term for an individual consists\nof the concept it expresses and the sensory criteria for its\napplication. Yet, the latter needn\u2019t be identical across\nindividuals for there to be common concepts, Lewis argued (1929, 115).\nInstead, common concepts just require shared structures of linguistic\ndefinition and common or congruent modes of behaviour, in particular\nco-operative behaviour that is guided by these concepts, a social\nachievement of a common world that Lewis thought our community of\nneeds and interests produces. One problem with this suggestion was\npointed out by Quine (1960) in Word and Object with his\nindeterminacy of translation argument. From the standpoint of an\ninterpreter, there can be alternative translation manuals or schemes\nthat are consistent with the total set of a speaker\u2019s verbal and\nother behavioural dispositions. This is a problem that Lewis (1946,\n144\u20135, 164) may have been aware of in AKV. In any case, in AKV\nhe seems to draw back from the discussion of common concepts in MWO\nand to rest content with pointing out that any attribution of\nlinguistic meaning or sense meaning to another is inductive and thus\nonly probable, and any attribution of linguistic or sense meaning\nsimilar to ours is likewise inductive, fallible, and problematic.\n\nLewis (1946, 84\u20135, 93\u20135) drew a sharp distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic truth. Analytic (or analytically true)\nstatements are true by virtue of the definition of the terms they\ncontained, and have zero intension (and universal comprehension). They\nare necessarily true, true in all possible worlds, no matter what else\nmight be true of a world or thing, and yet are not equivalent in\nmeaning to each other only due to the distinct intensions of their\nconstituents. In MWO Lewis occasionally claimed that we create\nnecessary truth by adopting concepts and criterial principles; in AKV\nhe was more circumspect. It is a matter of convention or legislation\nthat a term has the meaning it does, including sense meaning, but\nLewis (1946, 155\u20137) denied that analytic truth was truth by\nconvention. \u201cA dog is an animal\u201d is analytically true by\nvirtue of the sense meaning of \u201cdog\u201d and\n\u201canimal\u201d, in particular, the inclusion of the criterion\nfor applying the latter in the criterion for applying the former, and\nthat isn\u2019t a matter of convention. However, Lewis never tried to\ndefine such inclusion further. Quine (1951 [1953]) explicitly\ncriticized Lewis and the analytic/synthetic distinction in \u201cTwo\nDogmas of Empiricism\u201d, and would have objected to the idea of\nresting the analytic/synthetic distinction on an undefined notion of\nmeaning inclusion. Lewis (1946, 154), on the other hand, thought that\nmeaning inclusion is as unproblematic and recognizable a fact as the\ninclusion of one plan in another, e.g. a plan to visit France in a\nplan to visit Paris, and didn\u2019t need further explication.\nNonetheless, taking meaning inclusion to be a primitive fact also\nmakes it more difficult to distinguish Lewis\u2019 analytic necessity\nfrom the rationalists\u2019 synthetic necessity, despite his (Lewis\n1946, 157) vigorous rejection of the latter. This is especially so\nsince Lewis (1946, 129) denied that analytic truth is usefully\nelucidated as one that is reducible to logical truth with the\nsubstitution of definitions. For Lewis, the adequacy of a definition\nitself is a matter of analytic truth and what makes a truth a logical\ntruth is that it is an analytic truth concerning certain symbols.\n",
