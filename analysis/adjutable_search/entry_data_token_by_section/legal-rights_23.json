In fact, arguably there is\nsomething about moral rights that counts in favor of their practical\nimplementation and enforcement, such as through law (Hart 1955:\n177\u2013178). For instance, at times legal rights approximate their\nputative moral counterparts, functioning as moral rights roughly\nrecognized in law. For example, the content of legal rights to life or\nliberty arguably partially mirrors moral rights for the same values.\nIn fact, human rights law is often considered to give legal\nrecognition and even to roughly mirror moral human rights. When this\nis the case, arguably part of what justifies such legal rights are\ntheir moral counterparts. That said, given the complexity and\ncontingency of systems of positive law, there is perhaps something\nsimplistic in the mirroring view of how legal rights are justified by\nmoral rights (for a critical evaluation see Buchanan 2013; Buchanan\n& Sreenivasan 2018; Tomalty 2016). \n\nMoral rights can also lend moral justification to legal rights less\nstraightforwardly. For instance, a legal right to \u03c6 may protect\nand further adherence to a (or several different) moral right(s) to\nsomething else altogether. For example, the legal right to due process\nof law or the legal right to vote arguably draw some of their\njustification from their role as a means for the fulfillment of a\nvariety of moral rights, such as, for instance, the rights to dignity\nand liberty. \n\nNevertheless, arguably certain moral rights do not at all count in\nfavor of legal rights, be it in the form of a legal counterpart\n(Feinberg 1992: 156\u2013158, 161\u2013162; Brownlee 2012:\n125\u2013126; Buchanan & Sreenivasan 2018: 218\u2013219) or\nthrough some other type of legal right. For example, even assuming\ncertain cases of terminal illness involve holding a moral right\nagainst one\u2019s doctor to active euthanasia, it is not at all\nclear that such a right would justify a legal right to that effect,\neven if just for the unconscionability of enforcing such a right.\nMoreover, moral rights can count in favor and even justify legal\narrangements that do not take the form of any legal right (Waldron\n1999: 217\u2013219). For example, children may have a moral right to\nan education, yet plausibly the ideal way of assuring children obtain\nan education is by imposing a system of compulsory schooling. \n",
