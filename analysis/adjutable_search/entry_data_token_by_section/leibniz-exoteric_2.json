    "main_text": "The Primary Function of Exoteric Texts\n3. The Primary Function of Exoteric Texts\n\nLeibniz faced what might seem like an intractable problem. He thought\nthat the ideal form for metaphysics was the esoteric mode of\npresentation. However, he knew that few people were inclined to read\ntexts presented in the esoteric mode due to their daunting formal\nstructure. Even worse, Leibniz thought that the content of his\nphilosophy was such that most people were likely to misunderstand it\nin fundamental ways (see Whipple 2015a for a discussion of this\nproblem). How then would it be possible for him to communicate his\nviews to people? His letter to Hugony, cited earlier, suggested that\nit would involve a non-straightforward presentation of his views. In\nthat text he did not elaborate on what non-straightforward\npresentation involved, but he did provide more concrete suggestions in\nsome unpublished remarks appended to metaphysical notes written in\n1676. The quotation is divided into several parts for ease of\nreference:\n\n\n[a] Metaphysics should be written with accurate definitions and\ndemonstrations, [b] but nothing should be demonstrated in it that\nconflicts too much with received opinions. For thus this metaphysics\nwill be able to be received. [c] If it is once approved, then\nafterwards, if any examine it more profoundly, they will draw the\nnecessary consequences themselves. [d] Besides this, one can, as a\nseparate undertaking, show these people later the way of reasoning\nabout these things. [e] In this metaphysics, it will be useful for\nthere to be added here and there the authoritative utterances of great\nmen, who have reasoned in a similar way; especially when these\nutterances contain something that seems to have some possible\nrelevance to the illustration of a view. (A VI.iii.573)\n\n\n[a] is best read as a terse reference to the esoteric mode of\npresentation. Although this is the way that metaphysics should ideally\nbe written, he thinks that it would be a mistake to publish anything\nthat \u201cconflicts too much with received opinions\u201d. As we\nhave already seen, this is because many people will regard it as\nabsurd, summarily reject it, or misunderstand it entirely (possibly\nall three at the same time!). Leibniz suggests a strategy of selective\nomission, not to permanently hide the controversial features of his\nphilosophy, but as part of a longer-term strategy of preparing his\nreaders to understand his most esoteric doctrines. In some cases he\nthinks that sympathetic readers who study his texts \u201cmore\nprofoundly\u201d will be able to infer the esoteric conclusions\nthemselves. In [d] he suggests a complementary strategy of\nsupplementation. In subsequent works he can explicitly draw the\nconclusions that may have only been implicit in the initial text.\nTaken collectively Leibniz\u2019s remarks in this passage suggest\nthat the primary function of exoteric texts is pedagogical: they are\ndesigned to serve as intellectual stepping stones that enable his\nreaders to gradually move from received opinions to esoteric\ndoctrine.\n\nA number of Leibniz\u2019s remarks in later texts confirm that he\nconceives of exoteric texts as important preparatory works. Consider,\nfor example, what he writes to Fontenelle in 1704:\n\n\nThe true metaphysics, or philosophy, if you will, does not appear to\nme any less important than geometry, especially if there is also a way\nof introducing into it demonstrations, which until now have been\nentirely excluded from it, along with the calculus that will be\nnecessary in order to give them all the entry they need. However, it\nis necessary to prepare readers with exoteric writings. The journals\nhave served me well until now. (FC 1:234)\n\n\nHere Leibniz explicitly claims that his choice to present various\nfeatures of his philosophy in journal articles should be understood as\npart of a broad exoteric strategy to prepare his readers to understand\nthe \u201ctrue metaphysics\u201d. This helps shed light on some of\nLeibniz\u2019s better-known remarks about the composition of his\njournal articles. Consider what Leibniz writes to correspondent\nNicolas Remond in 1714:\n\n\nIn the Leipzig journal [Acta Eruditorum] I adapt myself to\nthe language of the schools, in the others I adapt myself more to the\nstyle of Cartesians, and in this latest piece I try to express myself\nin a way that could be understood by those who are not yet very\naccustomed to the style of one or the other. (G 3:624)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s strategy of adapting himself to the language of the\nschools in some articles and to the language of the Cartesians in\nothers is one of his core exoteric strategies. He thinks that using\nlanguage that is familiar with his readers is a good way to make his\nviews seem not too far removed from received opinions. This is not\nmerely a feature of his published writings. Leibniz tailors his\nwritings in a similar way in his private correspondences. For example,\nin his correspondence with Jesuit theologian Bartholomew Des Bosses he\nfrequently employs scholastic terminology, and in his correspondence\nwith (largely) Cartesian physicist Burcher De Volder he sometimes\npresents his views with a Cartesian slant. To use a more concrete\nexample, early in the correspondence with De Volder, Leibniz appeals\nto the doctrine of continued divine creation, which he (Leibniz)\nregards as a central Cartesian tenet. Although he initially presents\nthe doctrine in a way that makes it seem like this is a point of\ncommon doctrine between him and the Cartesians, it emerges later in\nthe correspondence that Leibniz only affirms the doctrine in a\nqualified sense (for a detailed discussion of this issue see Whipple\n2011). The general strategy here is to use language that is familiar\nto the reader or correspondent and to emphasize initial points of\nagreement. Fine-grained differences and esoteric implications are\ntypically avoided at the initial stages of engagement.\n\nOne important general point that emerges from Leibniz\u2019s remarks\nin the letter to Remond is that there was more than one set of\n\u201creceived opinions\u201d that he needed to take into account.\nThe received opinions of a Cartesian and the opinions of someone who\nwas committed to a version of Aristotelian Scholasticism would be\ndifferent in fundamental respects. In the letter cited above Leibniz\nspeaks of another of his works, the Principes de la Nature et de\nla Grace, fond\u00e9s en raison (Principles of Nature and\nGrace, Based on Reason), which targets yet another\naudience\u2014those who are not accustomed to the style of the\nCartesians or the scholastics. When it comes to exoteric philosophy,\none size does not fit all. Different strategies are required for\npeople with different backgrounds and views.\n",
