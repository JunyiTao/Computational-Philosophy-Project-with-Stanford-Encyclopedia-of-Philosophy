    "main_text": "A New Metaphysics and Epistemology || God and sensory error\n3.5 God and sensory error\n\nIn discussing the mark of truth, Descartes maintained that the human\nintellect is generally reliable because God created it. In discussing\nthe functioning of the senses to preserve the body, he explained that\nGod has arranged mind\u2013body interaction so that our sensations\ngenerally are conducive to the good of the body. Nonetheless, errors\noccur. Our judgments about sensory things may be false, just as, more\nbroadly, human beings may make poor moral choices even though God has\ngiven them a will that is intrinsically drawn to the good\n(Corr. 1:366, 5:159, Princ. I.42). For example, we\nmay form the childhood habit of judging, with respect to our color\nsensations, that the color we experience \u201cresembles\u201d\nsomething in objects (the Aristotelian theory). Subsequent\nphilosophical reflection (perhaps instigated by reading Descartes) may\nlead us to conclude that these judgments are unwarranted, because\ncolor sensations are not clear and distinct but obscure and confused\n(Princ. I.66\u201370). In other cases, our sense perceptions\nmay represent things as being a certain way when they are not.\nSometimes we feel pain because a nerve has been damaged somewhere\nalong its length, and yet there is no tissue damage at the place the\npain is felt. Amputees may feel pain as located in their fingers when\nthey have no fingers (Princ. IV.196).\n\nDescartes responded to these errors differently. He explained\ncognitive (judgmental) and moral errors as resulting from human\nfreedom (Med. IV). God provides human beings with a will, and\nwills are intrinsically free. But we have finite intellects. Because\nwe are free, we can choose to judge in cognitive or moral situations\nin which we do not have clear and distinct perceptions of the true or\nthe good. If human beings restricted their acts of will to cases of\nmaximum clear and distinct perception, they would never err. If we go\nwrong, Descartes contends, we are responsible, because we might have\nrestricted our judgments to matters about which we have the certainty\nof clear and distinct perception. The applicability of this solution\nto the case of color sensations and resemblance is, however, not\napparent, as we may not have made a reflective choice when, as\nchildren, we accepted the resemblance account of color experience. In\nthat case, we might become culpable only after reading and accepting\nDescartes\u2019 arguments that color sensations are obscure and\nconfused and applying this finding to our habitual assertion of\nresemblance.\n\nMatters are different for specific errors of sensory representation,\nsuch as the mislocation of pain. The senses depend on media and sense\norgans and on nerves that must run from the exterior of the body into\nthe brain. God sets up the mind\u2013body relation so that our\nsensations are good guides in most circumstances. But the media may be\npoor (the light may not be good), circumstances may be unusual (as\nwhen a partially submerged stick appears bent), or the nerves may be\ndamaged (as with the amputee). In these cases, the reports of the\nsenses are misleading. Since God has set up the system of\nmind\u2013body union, shouldn\u2019t God be held accountable for the\nfact that the senses can misrepresent how things are? Here Descartes\ndoes not appeal to our freedom of judgment, for in fact we must often\nuse the senses in suboptimal cognitive circumstances when navigating\nthrough life, with no opportunity for reflection and reasoned choice.\nRather, he points out that God was working with the finite mechanisms\nof the human body (7:88), and he suggests that God did the best that\ncould be done given the type of parts needed to constitute such a\nmachine (extended parts that might break or be unusually perturbed).\nIt\u2019s not God\u2019s fault that a well-made bodily machine can\noccasionally create sensations that misrepresent.\n\nSome cases of sensory misrepresentation are clear-cut cases of error.\nWith the amputee, the pain seems to be in fingers that are not there.\nThe representational content (that the fingers are damaged) does not\nmatch the world. Similarly, a partially submerged stick may look bent.\nEven if we use our intellects to interpret the illusions or sensory\nmisrepresentations so as to avoid error by withholding judgment or\neven by judging correctly (7:438), it remains clear that sensory\nmisrepresentation has occurred.\n\nIn other cases, Descartes describes the senses as providing material\nfor error, but it remains uncertain whether such error arises from\nmaking unwarranted judgments on obscure and confused sensations or is\ndue to straightforward sensory misrepresentation. In the Third\nMeditation, he describes sensations that were later called\n\u201csecondary qualities\u201d (e.g., colors, sounds, hot and cold)\nas \u201cmaterially false.\u201d Scholars have difficulty\ninterpreting this notion. Descartes initially defines material falsity\nas something that \u201coccurs in ideas, when they represent\nnon-things as things\u201d (7:43). He offers the idea of cold as an\nexample: our senses represent cold as a positive quality of objects,\nbut Descartes considers that cold may instead simply be the absence of\nheat and so isn\u2019t a quality of its own. Accordingly, this case\nshould be assimilated to sensory misrepresentation: representing\nthings as they are not (representing cold as a quality when it is the\nabsence of a quality).\n\nDescartes also offers a different gloss on the obscurity of sensory\nideas. He allows that such ideas may be \u201ctrue\u201d in the\nsense of representing something positive in things, but that they may\ndo so in such a way that \u201cthe reality which they represent is so\nextremely slight that I cannot even distinguish it from a\nnon-thing\u201d (7:44). Accordingly, sensory ideas are not\nmisrepresentations, they are simply so obscure and confused that we\ncannot tell what their representational content might be by\nconsidering their experienced character, such as the phenomenal\ncharacter of cold or of color. We then precipitately make an erroneous\njudgment that color sensations resemble their causes in objects.\n(Metaphysics and natural philosophy are needed to tell us what our\ncolor sensations obscurely represent: properties of object-surfaces\nthat reflect light a certain way\u2014see Sec. 5.) \u201cMaterial\nfalsity\u201d arises from representations so obscure that they allow\nroom for mistaken judgments (e.g., about resemblance).\n\nThe issues surrounding the notion of material falsity in Descartes are\nintricate but telling of his theory of mind and sensory\nrepresentation. Entrance to the literature can be gained through Wee\n(2006), Brown (2006, Ch. 4), and Hatfield (2013).\n",
