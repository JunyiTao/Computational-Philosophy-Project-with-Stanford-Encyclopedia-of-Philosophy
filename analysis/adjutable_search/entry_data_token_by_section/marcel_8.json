    "main_text": "Disponibilit\u00e9 and Indisponibilit\u00e9\n9. Disponibilit\u00e9 and Indisponibilit\u00e9\n\nMarcel emphasizes two general ways of comporting ourselves towards\nothers that can be used as barometers for intersubjective\nrelationships: disponibilit\u00e9 and\nindisponibilit\u00e9. These words\u2014generally\ntranslated as either \u201cavailability\u201d and\n\u201cunavailability\u201d or, less frequently, as\n\u201cdisposability\u201d and\n\u201cnon-disposability\u201d\u2014bear meanings for Marcel that do\nnot fully come across in English. Therefore, in addition to the sense\nof availability and unavailability, Marcel suggests the addition of\nthe concepts of \u201chandiness\u201d and \u201cunhandiness\u201d\nto his English readers in an attempt to clarify his meaning. Handiness\nand unhandiness refer to the availability of one\u2019s\n\u201cresources\u201d\u2014material, emotional, intellectual and\nspiritual. Thus, the term disponibilit\u00e9 refers to the\nmeasure in which I am available to someone, the state of having my\nresources at hand to offer; and this availability or unavailability of\nresources is a general state or disposition. While it may appear that\nthere is the possibility of a selfish allocation of one\u2019s\nresources, the truth is that when resources are not available, their\ninaccessibility affects both the other and the self. Marcel comments\nfrequently on the interconnected nature of the treatment of others and\nthe state of the self.\n\nIndisponibilit\u00e9 can manifest itself in any number of\nways; however, \u201cunavailability is invariably rooted in some\nmeasure of alienation\u201d (Marcel 1995, p. 40). Pride is an\ninstructive example of indisponibilit\u00e9, although the\nsame state of non-disposability would also exist in a person who has\ncome to view herself in functional terms, or one who is blinded by a\npurely technical worldview. Pride is not an exaggerated opinion of\noneself arising from self-love, which Marcel insists is really only\nvanity; rather, pride consists in believing that one is\nself-sufficient (Marcel 1995, p. 32). It consists in drawing\none\u2019s strength solely from oneself. \u201cThe proud man is cut\noff from a certain kind of communion with his fellow men, which pride,\nacting as a principle of destruction tends to break down. Indeed, this\ndestructiveness can be equally well directed against the\nself; pride is in no way incompatible with self-hate\u2026\u201d\n(Marcel 1995, p. 32).\n\nFor the person who is indisponible, other people are reduced\nto \u201cexamples\u201d or \u201ccases\u201d of genus \u201cother\nperson\u201d rather than being encountered qua other as\nunique individuals. Instead of encountering the other person as a\n\u2018Thou\u2019, the other is encountered as a \u2018He\u2019 or\n\u2018She\u2019, or even as an \u2018It\u2019.\n\nIf I treat a \u2018Thou\u2019as a \u2018He\u2019, I reduce the\nother to being only nature; an animated object which works in some\nways and not in others. If, on the contrary, I treat the other as\n\u2018Thou\u2019, I treat him and apprehend him qua\nfreedom. I apprehend him qua freedom because he is\nalso freedom and not only nature. (Marcel 1949, pp. 106\u2013107)\n\n\nWhen I treat the other person as a He or She, it is because he or she\nis kept at arm\u2019s length but within my grasp, outside of the\ncircle that I form with myself in my cogito but inside the\ncircle of \u201cmy world.\u201d\n\nThe other, in so far as he is other, only exists for me in so far as I\nam open to him, in so far as he is a Thou. But I am only open to him\nin so far as I cease to form a circle with myself, inside which I\nsomehow place the other, or rather his idea; for inside this circle,\nthe other becomes the idea of the other, and the idea of the other is\nno longer the other qua other, but the other qua\nrelated to me\u2026 (Marcel 1949, p. 107)\n\n\nWhen I treat the other person as a \u2018Her\u2019, I treat her, not\nas a presence, but as absent. However, when I treat the other as a\n\u2018He\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019 rather than a\n\u2018Thou\u2019, I become incapable of seeing myself as a\n\u2018Thou\u2019. In deprecating the other I deprecate myself.\n\nIf I treat the other person as purely external to me, as a\n\u2018Her\u2019, a generic Ms. X, I encounter her \u201cin\nfragments\u201d as it were. I encounter various aspects of the other\nperson, elements that might be used to fill out a questionnaire or\nform (name, occupation, age, etc.). I am not present to the other\nperson and I am closed off and indifferent to the presence she offers\nme. However, in encountering the other person in this manner\u2014not\nas another person but as a case or example of certain functions, roles\nor characteristics\u2014I myself cease to be a person, but take on\nthe role, speaking metaphorically, of the pen that would record these\ndisparate elements onto the form. Any other person could encounter the\nother in this impersonal manner. If this is the case, I myself have\nbecome interchangeable, replaceable. I have ceased to encounter her in\nthe absolutely unique communion of our two persons. This functional\nview of the other and, consequently, of the self, is a direct result\nof the \u201cspirit of abstraction.\u201d When the other is\nencountered as a generic case, I who encounter am myself a generic\ncase in the encounter. But the situation can be otherwise.\n\nIn contrast, \u201cthe characteristic of the soul which is present\nand at the disposal of others is that it cannot think in terms of\ncases; in its eyes there are no cases at all\u201d\n(Marcel 1995, p. 41). The person who is disponible, who is\navailable or disposable to others, has an entirely different\nexperience of her place in the world: she acknowledges her\ninterdependence with other people. Relationships of\ndisponibilit\u00e9 are characterized by presence and\ncommunication between persons qua other, qua\nfreedom\u2014a communication and communion between persons who\ntranscend their separation without merging into a unity, that is,\nwhile remaining separate to some degree. \u201cIt should be obvious\nat once that a being of this sort is not an autonomous whole, is not\nin [the] expressive English phrase, self-contained; on the contrary\nsuch a being is open and exposed, as unlike as can be to a compact\nimpenetrable mass\u201d (Marcel 1951a, p. 145). To be\ndisponible to the other is to be present to and for her, to\nput one\u2019s resources at her disposal, and to be open and\npermeable to her.\n\nIt will perhaps be made clearer if I say the person who is at my\ndisposal is the one who is capable of being with me with the whole of\nhimself when I am in need; while the one who is not at my disposal\nseems merely to offer me a temporary loan raised on his resources. For\nthe one I am a presence; for the other I am an object. (Marcel 1995,\np.\n 40).[9]\n\n",
