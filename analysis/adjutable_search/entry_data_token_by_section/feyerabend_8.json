The lectures began\nwith the claim that there is no method in science, but that there\nare some simple and helpful rules of thumb. Popper tried to\nshow \u201chow simple ideas that were derived from equally simple\nrequirements brought order into the complex world of research\u201d\n(pp. 88\u20139). Having being convinced by Popper\u2019s and Pierre\nDuhem\u2019s critiques of inductivism (the view that science proceeds\nthrough generalisation from facts recorded in experience), Feyerabend\nconsidered falsificationism a real option, and, he says, \u201cfell\nfor it\u201d (p. 89), applying falsificationism in his papers and\nlectures. This is not his first admission that he was a\nfalsificationist, but it is notable that he did not see it as\nentailing his having been a Popperian. Feyerabend was (usually) a\nfairly liberal falsificationist, always emphasising the\ntenacity with which scientists should defend their theories, and\nallowing that scientific theories can start by being untestable.\nFaithful Popperians like John Watkins and Joseph Agassi, he\nemphasises, continually ticked him off for being unorthodox (he was\nlater accused, by Agassi, of plagiarising from Popper). Instead he\nlater saw this interlude as an example of the dangers of abstract\nreasoning. Rationalism is already dangerous, since it \u201cparalyses\nour judgment\u201d (p. 89) and is invested with \u201can almost\nsuperhuman authority\u201d (p. 90). But Popper added a further\ndangerous element: simplicity. Such a philosophy, complains\nFeyerabend, \u201cmay be out of touch with reality\u2026 [that is],\nwith scientific practice\u201d (p. 90).\n\nFeyerabend is here referring to Popper\u2019s approach to the\nepistemology of science, which he himself followed and furthered for\nquite a while. In chapter II of The Logic of Scientific\nDiscovery (1934), Popper had distinguished between scientific\npractice and scientific standards, principles, or methodology. Arguing\nagainst a \u201cnaturalistic\u201d theory of method which makes\nstandards depend on practice, Popper opted instead for a strongly\nnormative epistemology, a discipline which lays down optimum rules of\nmethod for scientists to follow. This is one of the most important\naspects of the Popperian perspective which Feyerabend originally took\non board.\n\nSuch an epistemology, Feyerabend now complains, makes the false\nassumption that \u201crational\u201d standards can lead to a\npractice that is as mobile, rich and effective as the science we\nalready have. Falsificationism would destroy science as we know it.\nScience did not develop in accordance with Popper\u2019s model. It is\nnot \u201cirrational\u201d, but it contains no overarching pattern.\nPopper\u2019s rules could produce a science, but not the science we\nnow have. (Feyerabend remarks that the Logical Positivist Otto Neurath\nhad already put this criticism of Popper some time before (p.\n91)).\n\nIn 1952, Feyerabend presented his ideas on scientific change to\nPopper\u2019s LSE seminar and to a gathering of illustrious\nWittgensteinians (Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, H.L.A.Hart and\nGeorg Henrik von Wright) in Anscombe\u2019s Oxford flat. This meeting\nseems to have been the first airing of the important concept of\nincommensurability (although not the term itself, which crept\ninto publications only a decade later):\n\nOn one occasion which I remember vividly Anscombe, by a series of\nskilful questions, made me see how our conception (and even our\nperceptions) of well-defined and apparently self-contained facts may\ndepend on circumstances not apparent in them. There are entities such\nas physical objects which obey a \u201cconservation principle\u201d\nin the sense that they retain their identity through a variety of\nmanifestations and even when they are not present at all while other\nentities such as pains and after-images are \u201cannihilated\u201d\nwith their disappearance. The conservation principles may change from\none developmental stage of the human organism to another and they may\nbe different for different languages (cf. Whorf\u2019s \u201ccovert\nclassifications\u201d\u2026 ). I conjectured that such principles\nwould play an important role in science, that they might change during\nrevolutions and that deductive relations between pre-revolutionary and\npost-revolutionary theories might be broken off as a result.\n(SFS, p. 115).\n\n\nMajor discoveries, I said, are not like the discovery of America,\nwhere the general nature of the discovered object is already known.\nRather, they are like recognizing that one has been dreaming.\n(KT, p. 92).\n\n\nThese thoughts received an unenthusiastic reception from Hart, von\nWright and Popper. \n\nFeyerabend\u2019s articles on Wittgenstein culminated in his review\nof the Philosophical Investigations, the text of which he\nstudied in detail while he was in London. (\u201cBeing of a pedantic\nturn of mind\u201d, he says, \u201cI rewrote the book so that it\nlooked more like a treatise with a continuous argument\u201d.\n(SFS, p. 116)). Anscombe translated Feyerabend\u2019s\nsummary into English and sent it to The Philosophical Review.\nIt was accepted by the editor, Norman Malcolm (having been turned down\nby Gilbert Ryle, editor of Mind\u2014see KT, p.\n93). This review was Feyerabend\u2019s first English-language\npublication; he called it his \u201cWittgensteinian monster\u201d\n(p. 115). He later commented:\n\nI knew that Wittgenstein did not want to present a theory (of\nknowledge, or language), and I did not expressly formulate a theory\nmyself. But my arrangements made the text speak like a theory and\nfalsified Wittgenstein\u2019s intentions. (KT, p. 93).\n\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s emphasis on the need for concrete research and\nhis objections to abstract reasoning (\u201cLook, don\u2019t\nthink!\u201d) somewhat clashed with my own inclinations and the\npapers in which his influence is noticeable are therefore mixtures of\nconcrete examples and sweeping principles. (SFS, p. 115).\n\n\nIn his review of the Philosophical Investigations, he\nsummarised the book in a very effective way, drawing particular\nattention to Wittgenstein\u2019s critique of a family of\n\u201crealist\u201d or \u201cessentialist\u201d theories of\nmeaning according to which the meaning of a word is the object\ndesignated or referred to by that word. Feyerabend argued that\nWittgenstein was attempting a reductio ad absurdum of realist\ntheories, showing that they had the untenable implication that we\ncould not be said to know the meaning of words which we nevertheless\nconstantly use in totally unproblematic ways.\n\nUnfortunately, as argued in Preston 1997 (ch.2), Feyerabend completely\nfailed to follow up this insight by endorsing Wittgenstein\u2019s\nnon-representationalist conception of meaning, according to which the\nmeaning of a term is determined by its use. Instead, wrongly\nassociating the idea that meaning is use with positivism, Feyerabend\nproferred what he called a \u201ccontextual\u201d theory of meaning,\nwhich identified the meaning of a term or statement with whatever role\nit plays in theoretical contexts. But he over-extended the\nidea of the theoretical to cover any context whatever, thus\ncompletely depriving it of content. For Feyerabend, the theoretical\ncontrasts with nothing at all.\n\nThe book review was also critical of Wittgenstein, though. Notably, it\nrailed against Wittgenstein\u2019s conception of philosophy (as\n\u201cphilosophical analysis\u201d). In a short article published\nthe next year (1956), Feyerabend expanded on his critique, arguing\nthat consideration of G.E.Moore\u2019s famous \u201cparadox of\nanalysis\u201d showed that \u201cphilosophy cannot be analytic\nand scientific, i.e., interesting, progressive, about a certain\nsubject matter, informative at the same time\u201d (\u201cA\nNote on the Paradox of Analysis\u201d, p. 95). Feyerabend thenceforth\nplumped for (what he conceived of as) scientific philosophy.\nLike Popper, he had very little time for the kind of\n\u201canalytic\u201d philosophy or \u201clinguistic\u201d\nphilosophy which followed in Wittgenstein\u2019s wake, and with which\nOxford University dominated the philosophical scene in the 1950s and\nearly 1960s.\n\nOne of the things that comes across most clearly from his\nautobiography is the consistently malleable nature of\nFeyerabend\u2019s views. He records that his friend Agassi caused him\ncompletely to change his mind about a book he considered translating.\nWhen Agassi urged Feyerabend to become a faithful Popperian,\nFeyerabend\u2019s resistance seems to have been based mainly on his\naversion to groups.\n",
