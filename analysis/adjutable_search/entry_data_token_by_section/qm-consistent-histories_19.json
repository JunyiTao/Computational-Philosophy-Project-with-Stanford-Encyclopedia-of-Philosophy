    "main_text": "Measurement and Preparation || Generalized and Weak Measurements\n7.4 Generalized and Weak Measurements\nVon Neumann\u2019s measurement model in \n section 7.1\nis often referred to as a \u201cprojective measurement\u201d, since its outcome\n\\(k\\), see , indicates an earlier quantum property corresponding to\nthe projector \\([s^k]\\). It is also called a \u201cstrong measurement\u201d in\ncontrast to a weak measurement as defined below. In practice one often\nuses a more general measurement model, referred to as\na generalized measurement or POVM (positive operator value\nmeasure) where the measurement outcome corresponds not to a specific\nproperty but instead to a positive (semi-definite) operator for the\nmeasured system at an earlier time. \n\n\nGeneralized measurements are often thought of in the following\nway. Instead of interacting directly with the measurement apparatus,\nthe system to be measured first interacts with another (microscopic)\nsystem, a probe, prepared in a known quantum state. Then the\nprobe is subjected to a projective measurement, and from its outcome\none learns something about the original system. If the interaction\nbetween the probe and the system of interest is very weak this is\ncalled a weak measurement. Sometimes a hybrid measurement is\nemployed, in which, following its interaction with a probe, the\noriginal system is subjected to another (typically projective)\nmeasurement. Both the weak measurement and the hybrid are examples of\ngeneralized measurements, and can be discussed in the manner indicated\nbelow. A weak measurement must be carefully distinguished from\na weak value; see the comment at the end of this section.\n\nThe generalized measurement model starts, as in Sec.\u00a0[sbct7.1], with a\nHilbert space \\({{\\mathcal H}}={{\\mathcal H}}_s\\otimes{{\\mathcal\nH}}_m\\), where \\({{\\mathcal H}}_s\\) represents the measured system\n(hereafter referred to as a particle), and \\({{\\mathcal H}}_m\\) the\nmeasuring apparatus, including the probe if that is part of the\narrangement. And as in and assume an initial state\n\n\n\\[\n{|\\Psi_0\\rangle }={|s_0\\rangle }\\otimes{|m_0\\rangle }, \\label{eqn31}\n\\]\n\n\n and a unitary time development from \\(t_0\\) to later times \\(t_1 < t_2\\) given by \n\n\n\\[\n{|\\Psi_1\\rangle } = T(t_1,t_0) {|\\Psi_0\\rangle } ={|\\Psi_0\\rangle },\\quad  \n{|\\Psi_2\\rangle } = T(t_2,t_1) {|\\Psi_1\\rangle }, \\label{eqn32}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere, as previously, we are assuming that the time interval from\n\\(t_0\\) to \\(t_1\\) is so short that \\(T(t_1,t_0)\\) is the identity\noperator.\n\nBut instead of introducing pure states \\({|m^j\\rangle }\\) for the\ndifferent positions of the measurement pointer, we assume a projective\ndecomposition of the identity of \\({{\\mathcal H}}\\),\n\n\\[I =\\sum_k M^k,\n\\label{eqn33}\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(M^k\\) projects onto the entire (macroscopic) subspace in which\nthe apparatus pointer is in position \\(k\\). Since any two situations\nwhich are macroscopically distinct correspond to mutually orthogonal\nsubspaces of the quantum Hilbert space, the \\(M^k\\) for different\n\\(k\\) will be orthogonal to each other. In addition one can include a\nspecial projector, say \\(\\hat M\\), in the sum to represent any\nadditional possibilities (e.g., the pointer has fallen off the\napparatus), to make the sum add up to \\(I\\). The \\({|m^j\\rangle }\\) of\nSec.\u00a0[sbct7.1] are related to the \\(M^k\\) through\n\n\\[M^k {|m^j\\rangle } = {\\delta }_{jk} {|m^j\\rangle },  \n\\label{eqn34}\\]\n\n\ni.e., \\({|m^j\\rangle }\\) belongs to the subspace associated with\n\\(M^j\\).\n\nSince we are interested in what the measurement tells us about the\nparticle, we can regard the initial apparatus state \\({|m_0\\rangle }\\)\nin as fixed, and indicate the dependence of \\({|\\Psi_2\\rangle }\\) on\n\\({|s_0\\rangle }\\) using the formula\n\n\\[{|\\Psi_2\\rangle } = J {|s_0\\rangle },\n\\label{eqn35}\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(J\\) is an isometry (it preserves inner products) that maps\n\\({{\\mathcal H}}_s\\) onto a subspace of \\({{\\mathcal H}}\\). This\nprovides a convenient way to define operators\n\n\\[Q^k = J{^\\dagger }M^k J.\n\\label{eqn36}\\]\n\n\nacting on \\({{\\mathcal H}}_s\\). Because the \\(M^k\\) are positive\n(semi-definite) operators, the same is true of the \\(Q^k\\), and\nbecause \\(J{^\\dagger }J= I_s\\) (\\(J{^\\dagger }\\) is the left inverse\nof \\(J\\)), it follows from that\n\n\\[\\sum_k Q^k = I_s. \\label{eqn37}\\]\n\n\n(We assume that \\(\\hat Q=J{^\\dagger }\\hat M J=0\\) for the special\nprojector \\(\\hat M\\) introduced following .) Thus \\(\\{Q^k\\}\\) is a\ncollection of positive operators which sum to the identity, which is\nthe definition of a POVM.\n\nIf every \\(Q^k\\) is a projector, then implies that they are mutually\northogonal, and form a projective decomposition of the identity of\n\\({{\\mathcal H}}_s\\). This means we are dealing with a projective\nmeasurement, though more general than the von Neumann model of\nSec.\u00a0[sbct7.1], as the \\(Q^k\\) may project on subspaces of dimension\ngreater than 1. However, in general \\(Q^k\\) is not a projector or\nproportional to a projector, but since it is Hermitian it can be\nwritten in the form\n\n\\[Q^k = \\sum_j q_{jk} \\xi^{jk}, \\quad \\sum_j \\xi^{jk} = I_s,\n\\label{eqn38}\\]\n\n\nwhere for a fixed \\(k\\) the \\(\\{\\xi^{jk}\\}\\) form a projective\ndecomposition of \\(I_s\\), and the \\(\\{q_{jk}\\}\\) are the nonnegative\neigenvalues of \\(Q^k\\). It is then not hard to show that the family of\nhistories\n\n\\[Y^{jk} = [s_0]\\otimes[m_0] \\odot \\xi^{jk}\\otimes I_m \\odot M^k,\n\\label{eqn39}\\]\n\n\nlabeled by both \\(j\\) and \\(k\\), is consistent. It gives rise to\nconditional probabilities\n\n\\[\\Pr(\\xi^{jk}_1 {\\boldsymbol{\\mid}}M^k_2) = p_{jk} = q_{jk} \\mte{s_0}{\\xi^{jk}}/\\mte{s_0}{Q^k},\n\\label{eqn40}\\]\n\n\nwhere the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 indicate the time. In words, what\ntells us is that if at the end of a run the pointer is in position\n\\(k\\), then at the earlier time before the measurement took place the\nparticle had a property represented by a projector \\(\\xi^{jk}\\) for\nsome value of \\(j\\). If in addition the initial state \\({|s_0\\rangle\n}\\) is known, that can be used to assign a probability \\(p_{jk}\\),\nnote that \\(\\sum_j p_{jk}=1\\), to the property \\(\\xi^{jk}\\) at time\n\\(t_1\\). While not as \u201cclean\u201d as in the case of a projective\nmeasurement, this can still be informative.\n\nLet us close this section with two additional remarks about weak\nmeasurements, including the hybrid case. First, there is an abundant\nliterature in which weak measurements are discussed in terms of\nso-called weak values of certain quantum observables. The\nphysical significance (if any) of weak values has been the subject of\nan ongoing controversy. Without entering that discussion it is worth\npointing out that apart from exceptional cases a weak value has\nnothing to do with a quantum property in the sense used in the\nhistories interpretation, related to some subspace of the quantum\nHilbert space; e.g., one of the \\(\\xi^{jk}\\) in .\n\nSecond, a single weak measurement corresponding to a weak interaction\nbetween particle and probe will not yield much information about the\nparticle, and hence it is usually assumed that such a measurement will\nbe repeated a large number of times, with the particle prepared in the\nsame initial state for each run, so that useful information can be\nextracted from the random outcomes. It is sometimes assumed that\nbecause the interaction is weak, in none of the runs will the state of\nthe particle change significantly. However, that is not necessarily\nthe case. Weakness of the interaction is also consistent with the\nparticle\u2019s state being drastically altered in a number of runs,\nprovided these are but a small fraction of the total. A useful example\nis provided by Feynman (Feynman, Leighton,\n& Sands: Chapter 1) in his discussion of a weak light\nsource used to determine which of two holes an electron passes through\non its way to a distant screen where successive arrivals display a\ntwo-hole (double slit) interference pattern. If the light source is\nvery weak, only for a small fraction of the runs does a scattered\nphoton reveals which hole the electron went through. But if one\ncollects data for these rare instances one finds a very large effect:\nin these runs the interference pattern is completely washed out.\nSee the \n Further Reading supplement for additional\ndetails of the histories approach to generalized and weak\nmeasurements.\n",
