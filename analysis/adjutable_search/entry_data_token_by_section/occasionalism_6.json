    "main_text": "Occasionalism in Context || Cartesian Interactionism, Pre-established Harmony, and Occasionalism\n2.1 Cartesian Interactionism, Pre-established Harmony, and Occasionalism\n\nOne way to view occasionalism is to see it as one of three possible\nresponses to the aforementioned problem of mind-body interaction. The\nother two responses would be \u201cCartesian interactionism\u201d\nand Leibniz\u2019s \u201cpre-established harmony.\u201d\n\nFaced with the issue of accounting for the apparent phenomena of\nmind-body interaction, those who subscribed to \u201cCartesian\ninteractionism\u201d (following Williams 1978, 287; Williams actually\ndescribes the situation as a \u201cscandal\u201d) held that the\ncausal interaction is not merely apparent but real. In other words,\nchanges in the body and mind really bring about changes in each other.\nBut many found this position deeply unsatisfying. Some raised\nquestions about whether it was intelligible that such radically\ndistinct substances with nothing in common causally interacted, and\nothers questioned whether such a view was consistent with the view\nthat was gaining popularity, namely, that the material universe is\ncausally closed and governed solely by physical laws of nature.\nWhether or not Descartes actually held this interactionist position\nis, as discussed earlier, a matter of controversy, but even in\nDescartes\u2019 time the list of the critics of interactionism was a\nlong one.\n\nOccasionalism and pre-established harmony emerged as alternatives to\nthe model of interactionism, in rejecting that there is genuine causal\ninteraction. In fact, their denial of real causal interaction among\ndistinct finite substances is not limited to mind-body interaction but\napplies across all board, be it body-body or mind-body causation. In\nother words, both views can be said to deny all\ninter-substantial causation, where by \u201csubstance\u201d\nwe refer to finite substances or\n creatures.[12]\n However, occasionalism and pre-established parted ways when it came\nto the question of intra-substantial causation\u2014that is,\nwhether or not there is causal activity going on within the\nsubstances such that finite substances are active in causing their own\nstates. Leibniz, the principal proponent of pre-established harmony,\nheld firm to the view that, while finite substances do not have the\ncausal power to bring about changes in other substances, they\nare causally active internally, that is, in causing their own\nstates. Each creature causally contributes to the occurrence of its\nown states, and the apparent interaction between distinct substances\nis due to how the states of distinct substances harmonize with each\nother. Following our characterization of occasionalism at the outset,\neven if the relevant domain of concern is restricted to the states of\na single, individual substance, an occasionalism would have to hold\nthat the creature itself is not playing a genuine causal role in the\noccurrence of those states. Leibniz, as a proponent of genuine\nintra-substantial causal forces, would reject this claim. Malebranche,\nin contrast, denied all causal powers to creatures, including the\nintra-substantial powers endorsed by Leibniz. For Malebranche, even\nthe internal states of a creature are mere occasions for God to bring\nabout the relevant subsequent states.\n",
