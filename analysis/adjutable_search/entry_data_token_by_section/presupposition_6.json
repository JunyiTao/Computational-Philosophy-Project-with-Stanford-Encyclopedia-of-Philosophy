He noted that for every configuration of anaphors and\nantecedents where a pronoun is interpreted anaphorically but is not\ninterpretable as a bound variable, a similar configuration is possible\nwith\n presuppositions.[13]\n In each of the following quadruples, we illustrate some configuration\nin the (a) and (b) examples, while the (c) and (d) cases show that a\nslight divergence from the original configurations (i.e. those in (a)\nand (b)), produces infelicity. Note that the (a) and (c) examples\ninclude an anaphoric pronoun (\u201cit\u201d), and the (b) and (d)\nexamples include the factive verb \u201cknows\u201d, which triggers\na presupposition that its propositional complement is true (i.e., that\nFred left). So, anaphora is felicitous in configurations in which\npresuppositions are felicitous, and anaphora is infelicitous in\nconfigurations in which presuppositions are infelicitous. It is clear\nthat connections between anaphoric pronouns and their antecedents on\nthe one hand, and presupposition triggers and their antecedents on the\nother, are sensitive to very similar configurational requirements.\nInter-sentential (discourse) anaphora\n\n(21a)\n There was a storm. It was fierce.\n(21b)\nFred left. Mary knows that Fred left.\n(21c)\n#It was fierce. There was a storm.\n(21d)\n#Mary knows that Fred left. Fred left.\n\nDonkey anaphora\n\n(22a)\nIf a farmer owns a donkey then he beats it.\n(22b)\nIf Fred left then Mary knows that Fred left.\n(22c)\n#If a farmer doesn\u2019t own a donkey, then he beats it.\n(22d)\n#If Fred didn\u2019t leave left then Mary knows that Fred left.\n\nModal subordination\n\n(23a)\nA wolf might come to the door. It would eat you.\n(23b)\nFred might have left. Mary would know that Fred has left.\n(23c)\n#A wolf might come to the door. It\u2019s brown.\n(23d)\n#Fred might have left. Mary knows that Fred has left.\n\nBathroom anaphora\n\n(24a)\nEither there\u2019s no bathroom in this house, or else it\u2019s in a\nfunny place.\n(24b)\nEither Fred didn\u2019t leave, or else Mary knows that he left.\n(24c)\n#Either there is a bathroom, or else it\u2019s in a funny place.\n(24d)\n#Either Fred left, or else Mary knows that he left.\n\n",
