    "main_text": "Abu Bakr al-Razi\n2. Abu Bakr al-Razi\n\nThe bad reputation of Abu Bakr al-Razi (850-925 circa) as a\n\u201cheterodox\u201d and \u201cunbelieving\u201d philosopher of\nMedieval Islam seems to have generally influenced most of the Medieval\nJewish authors, as it appears in particular in Maimonides. However,\nthis did not prevent some of them from quoting and employing some of\nhis works as sources for building their own thought.\n\nAs for Maimonides\u2019 harsh judgement of al-Razi as a philosopher,\nit was clearly based upon the knowledge of the general contents of his\nmetaphysics and theology as found in al-Razi\u2019s Book of\nDivine Science (Kitab al-\u2018ilm al-ilahi), as found\nboth in his Guide of the Perplexed (Dalalat\nal-ha\u2019irin) and in one of his letters to the\n\u201cofficial\u201d translator of his work, Samuel Ibn Tibbon. In\nthe latter, he affirms that al-Razi\u2019s book on Divine\nScience is not useful, since al-Razi was only a physician (and\nnot a real philosopher) (Marx 1934\u20131935, 378; about the real\ninfluence of Maimonides\u2019 letter, see also Harvey 1992). In part\nthree, chapter 12, of the Guide, in a more explicit way he\naffirms that al-Razi\u2019s book is full of raving ideas and\nignorance: according to him, al-Razi thought that in human life there\nis surely more evil than good, so that even the divine goodness should\nbe seriously questioned (Moses Maimonides 1963, 2:441\u2013442).\nNotwithstanding this, two other Jewish philosophers at least mentioned\nal-Razi and employed some of his ideas. Moses Ibn Ezra, in chapter 5\nof his Treatise of the Garden, quotes a passage of al-Razi\nabout motion and comments on it by affirming that al-Razi is contrary\nto Aristotle\u2019s opinion and supports Plato\u2019s instead (see\nms. of Jerusalem, Jewish National and University Library, 8\u00b0 570,\npage 51, lines 5\u20138). Abu l-Barakat Ibn Malka al-Baghdadi,\nworking in Baghdad around 1150, in his Book about the Point of\nView (Kitab al-mu\u2018tabar) \u2014 mostly based upon\nAvicenna\u2019s philosophy and possibly written before the\nauthor\u2019s conversion to Islam \u2013 followed in some cases\nal-Razi\u2019s doctrines, in particular his idea of two different\nideas of time, \u201ceternal time\u201d and \u201ccreated\none\u201d (see Pines 1979, 151\u2013153).\n",
