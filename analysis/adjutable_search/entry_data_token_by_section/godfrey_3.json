    "main_text": "Analogy of Being\n4. Analogy of Being\n\n\nIn describing being as being as the object of the intellect in\nQuodlibet II, q. 8, Godfrey also states that being is taken\nanalogically and not univocally. It is affirmed first and foremost of\nsubstance, especially of first substance, and of everything else as\nrelated to substance. Hence both substance and accident are included\nunder this analogous notion of being and this single object of the\nintellect (PB 2.135\u201336; Wippel, 1981, 19\u201324). In Quodlibet III, q. 1 he\nattempts to establish the analogical character of being by arguing at\nsome length that it cannot be either univocal or purely equivocal.\nCentral to his rejection of univocity of being is his denial that it is\na supreme genus. It must apply not only to the generic and specific\naspects in which different things share, but also to the differences,\nincluding the individual differences between them (PB 2.162\u201363). In\nQuodlibet XV, q. 3, while responding to an objection perhaps taken from\nMeister Eckhart\u2019s Parisian Disputed Question 1, he maintains that, if\nbeing is applied to accidents insofar as they are related to substance\nin some way, this does not mean that being is not intrinsically present\nin accidents. So, too, when it is applied to creatures viewed as\neffects and to God their cause, it applies intrinsically to God. There\nis an analogy and proportion in reality between these different\ninstantiations of being and corresponding to this, there is analogy in\nmeaning as well. It is this that is grasped by the analogous concept of\nbeing (PB 14.18\u201320; Wippel, 2001, 381\u201382).\n",
