    "main_text": "Some Themes in Strawson\u2019s Writings || History of Philosophy\n9.3 History of Philosophy\n\nAnother theme that needs stressing is Strawson\u2019s engagement with\nthe history of philosophy. His work on Kant in The Bounds of\nSense and in other articles is perhaps the most straightforward\nexample of this engagement, but it is not the only instance. In\nIndividuals and elsewhere he wrote about Descartes,\nespecially his account of the self. Leibniz is the hero, or perhaps\nanti-hero, of chapter 4 of Individuals. Hume and Wittgenstein\nare the central characters in Skepticism and Naturalism, and\nhe wrote about Spinoza, especially his theory of freedom. From the\nlast century, he wrote about Wittgenstein, in a famous review of the\nPhilosophical Investigations, published in Mind\n(reprinted in Strawson 2011), and also G.E. Moore. These writings\nreveal both a deep knowledge and a deep understanding of these\nthinkers, never unsympathetic and always able to see the wood as well\nas the trees. Strawson had a sense of the age of philosophical\nproblems, and of the insights from the great dead philosophers that\nneed preserving and renewing.\n",
