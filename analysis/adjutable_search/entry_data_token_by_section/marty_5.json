    "main_text": "Space and Time\n4. Space and Time\n\nThough Marty\u2019s publications are almost exclusively concerned\nwith linguistic matters, he lectured extensively in all areas of\nphilosophy. Most of his literary remains have indeed been left\nunpublished. (See the catalogue in Bokhove and Raynaud 1990:\n250\u2013264.) The extensive correspondence with Brentano, most of\nwhich is also unpublished, is of course of great interest in\nconnection with both of these philosophers. No ultimate assessment of\nMarty\u2019s philosophical accomplishment will be possible until this\nmaterial, including lecture notes, letters, and other manuscripts of\ninterest, becomes accessible. A couple of years after his death,\nhowever, a work by him on space and time was published (Marty, [eds.]\nEisenmeier et al. 1916c). This work gives us a rare look into\nMarty\u2019s mature ontology. Though the resulting ontology of space\nand time is very much in line with Newtonian physics, it should be\nnoted that Marty\u2019s work on space and time was published\nposthumously in the same year in which Einstein\u2019s celebrated\npaper on general relativity appeared (Einstein 1916). Unlike Brentano,\nhe did not have the advantage of living long enough to have the chance\nof responding to the new concept of space-time that won the day in\nphysics (Brentano, [ed.] K\u00f6rner and Chisholm 1976: 29 f.). The\nwork may nonetheless prove of to be of value at least insofar as it\ncontains criticisms of the views of such outstanding philosophers as\nLeibniz, Berkeley, Kant, and Lotze.\n\nIn the work under consideration Marty argues for the thesis that space\nand time exist objectively as non-real entities. This thesis is\nmaintained in opposition not only to the various philosophical systems\nin which space or time is regarded as subjective, e.g. as an a\npriori form of intuition, but also in opposition to\nBrentano\u2019s later view, according to which space and time is to\nbe regarded as a linguistic fiction used to describe real things in\ntheir various modes. While it is indeed a misfortune that Marty is\nrelying on a discarded view from the standpoint of physics, his thesis\nthat space and time are non-real entities and his defense of a\ncontainer conception of space (Johansson 2019, 99) must be\ndistinguished from his Newtonian presuppositions. Just as followers of\nKant have managed to adhere to his views on space and time in spite of\nemergence of non-Euclidean geometries and the theory of relativity,\nMarty\u2019s basic ontological view on these matters can be\nconsidered apart from such developments, however important they may be\n(for a contemporary defense of Marty\u2019s conception of space see\nJohansson 2019).\n",
