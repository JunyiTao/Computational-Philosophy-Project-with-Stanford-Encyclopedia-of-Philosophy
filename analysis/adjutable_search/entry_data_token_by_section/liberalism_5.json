Three factors help explain the rise of this revisionist theory.\nFirst, the new liberalism was clearly taking its own distinctive shape\nby the early twentieth century, as the ability of a free market to\nsustain what Lord Beveridge (1944: 96) called a \u2018prosperous\nequilibrium\u2019 was being questioned. Believing that a private\nproperty based market tended to be unstable, or could, as Keynes\nargued (1973 [1936]), get stuck in an equilibrium with high\nunemployment, new liberals came to doubt, initially on empirical\ngrounds, that classical liberalism was an adequate foundation for a\nstable, free society. Here the second factor comes into play: just as\nthe new liberals were losing faith in the market, their faith in\ngovernment as a means of supervising economic life was increasing.\nThis was partly due to the experiences of the First World War, in\nwhich government attempts at economic planning seemed to succeed\n(Dewey, 1929: 551\u201360); more importantly, this reevaluation of\nthe state was spurred by the democratization of western states, and\nthe conviction that, for the first time, elected officials could truly\nbe, in J.A. Hobson\u2019s phrase \u2018representatives of the\ncommunity\u2019 (1922: 49). As D.G. Ritchie proclaimed:\n\nbe it observed that arguments used against \u2018government\u2019\naction, where the government is entirely or mainly in the hands of a\nruling class or caste, exercising wisely or unwisely a paternal or\ngrandmotherly authority \u2014 such arguments lose their force just\nin proportion as the government becomes more and more genuinely the\ngovernment of the people by the people themselves. (1896: 64)\n\n\nThe third factor underlying the currency of the new liberalism was\nprobably the most fundamental: a growing conviction that, so far from\nbeing \u2018the guardian of every other right\u2019 (Ely, 1992: 26),\nproperty rights foster an unjust inequality of power. They entrench a\nmerely formal equality that in actual practice systematically fails to\nsecure the kind of equal positive liberty that matters on the ground\nfor the working class. This theme is central to what is now called\n\u2018liberalism\u2019 in American politics, combining a strong\nendorsement of civil and personal liberties with indifference or even\nhostility to private ownership. The seeds of this newer liberalism can\nbe found in Mill\u2019s On Liberty. Although Mill insisted\nthat the \u2018so-called doctrine of Free Trade\u2019 rested on\n\u2018equally solid\u2019 grounds as did the \u2018principle of\nindividual liberty\u2019 (1963, vol. 18: 293), he nevertheless\ninsisted that the justifications of personal and economic liberty were\ndistinct. And in his Principles of Political Economy, Mill\nconsistently emphasized that it is an open question whether personal\nliberty can flourish without private property (1963, vol. 2;\n203\u2013210), a view that Rawls was to reassert over a century later\n(2001: Part IV).\n",
