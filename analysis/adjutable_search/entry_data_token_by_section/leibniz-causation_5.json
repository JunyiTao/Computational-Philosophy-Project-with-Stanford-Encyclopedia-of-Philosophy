Divine Causation\n\nIt is difficult to distinguish the actions of God from those of\ncreatures, for some believe that God does everything, while others\nimagine that he merely conserves the force he has given to creatures.\n(Discourse on Metaphysics G iv, 432/AG 40)\n\n\nNot all systems of pre-established harmony are the same.\nLeibniz\u2019s own version represents a form of concurrentism, since\nhe rejects the view that the change in perceptual states of a created\nsubstance is due solely to that created substance itself. As he\nwrites, \u201cEach and every substance is the true and real cause of\nits own immanent actions and has the power to act \u2026 sustained\nby divine concurrence\u201d (A vi, 4 Strickland 2006). According to\nLeibniz, both God and created substances are causally responsible for\nchanges in the states of created substances. But God is no minor\nplayer in this effort; God is immediately and directly causally\npresent in every aspect of the universe, even in those effects\nnormally attributed to created substances. Consider these two\ntexts:\n\n\n[God] operates immediately on all created things, continually\nproducing them \u2026 (New Essays A vi, 6, 222)\n\nGod continually produces all that is real in creatures. But I hold\nthat in doing it he also continually produces or conserves in us that\nenergy or activity which according to me constitutes the nature of\nsubstance and the source of its modifications. (New System GP\niv 588f/Adams, 98)\n\n\nLeibniz argues for this view in the Theodicy: \u201cthe action of God\nin conserving should have some reference to that which is conserved,\naccording to what it is and to the state wherein it is; thus his\naction cannot be general or indeterminate\u201d (Theodicy\n\u00a727). So even though Leibniz rejects occasionalism, Leibniz does\nagree with the occasionalist Malebranche that God must be given his\ncausal due. It is certainly not a mere afterthought. In fact, both\nagree that \u201cconservation is continual creation.\u201d Consider\nanother two passages from Leibniz:\n\n\n[T]he duration of things (the multiplicity of momentary states) is the\ntotal of an infinity of divine fulgurations, of which each one at each\ninstant is a creation or reproduction of everything; which strictly\nspeaking leaves no continuous passage from one state to the next. This\nprovides a perfect proof of that famous truth of Christian theologians\nand philosophers, that the conservation of things is a continual\ncreation; and it gives a very special way of verifying the dependence\nof every changeable thing on the unchangeable divinity \u2026.\n(Letter to Sophie Charlotte GP vii 564f)\n\nAnd when it is said that the creature depends upon God insofar as it\nexists and insofar as it acts, and even that conservation is a\ncontinual creation, this is true in that God gives always [donne\ntoujours] to the creature and produces continually all that in it\nis positive, good and perfect, every perfect gift coming from the\nFather of lights. (Theodicy \u00a731)\n\n\nCommitment to continual creation is thus an important constraint on\nLeibniz\u2019s theory of causation. Ultimately, Leibniz adopts a form\nof concurrentism in which the natural change in the perceptual states\nof a created substance is due to the direct involvement of\nboth the created substance and God. In other words, created\nsubstances possess genuine causal powers even while God\u2019s own\ncausal power is flexed everywhere in creation, including that of\ncreated substances and their states.\n\nSince God\u2019s causal activity complements created substances,\nincluding our own, Leibniz does not count such activity as miraculous.\nMiracles are interventions in the natural course of events.\nProperly speaking then, this activity is not intervention on\nGod\u2019s part, but divine cooperation or concurrence. Leibniz\nwrites: \u201cIn concurring with our actions, God ordinarily does no\nmore than follow the laws he has established, that is, he continually\nconserves and produces our being in such a way that thoughts come to\nus spontaneously or freely in the order that the notion pertaining to\nour individual substance contains them, a notion in which they could\nbe foreseen from all eternity\u201d (Discourse on\nMetaphysics \u00a730 AG 63).\n\nShould we take take Leibniz\u2019s word for it? Some commentators are\nnot convinced that Leibniz consistently advocates concurrentism, for\nif the doctrine of continual creation was taken seriously (that is,\nthat God continuously produces all things), then how can anything but\noccasionalism be the natural upshot? David Scott puts it this way:\n\u201cAfter all, it is a fundamental Leibnizian tenet that the\n\u2018degree of perfection\u2019 of a thing is the extent to which\nthat thing acts. [Discourse on Metaphysics \u00a715] Thus, if\na thing\u2019s perfection or action is \u2018due to God\u2019 (as\nopposed to itself) then we have a de facto occasionalism in which God\ndoes all the work. The question here is what sense can be made of the\nidea that God\u2019s conservation is a \u2018support\u2019 for the\n\u2018natural permanence of a thing which comes into\nexistence\u2019\u201d (Scott \u00a74). Scott continues to claim that\n\u201cthe notion of God supporting the natural permanence of things\nis a contradiction in Leibnizian terms, resolvable only if a greater,\noccasionalist-like dependence of nature upon God is admitted.\u201d\nThe problem, however, is that Leibniz certainly does reject\noccasionalism and specifically tries to show (unsuccessfully,\naccording to Scott) that continual creation is consistent with the\ngenuine causal activity of created substances. Perhaps it is\ninescapably philosophically untenable, but Leibniz\u2019s view is\nthat \u201c[God\u2019s action] cannot be general or indeterminate.\n\u2026 Conservation by God consists in the perpetual immediate\ninfluence which the dependence of creatures demands\u201d\n(Theodicy \u00a727).\n\nIt may be tempting to say that for Leibniz we know that God\ndoes act on created substances continually, but we cannot understand\nhow he does this. Consider what Leibniz writes in the New\nEssays: \u201c[A]ll monads were created by God and depend on\nhim; yet we cannot understand in detail how this was done; and\nfundamentally the preservation of monads is nothing but a continual\ncreation, as the Scholastics knew very well\u201d (New\nEssays A vi, 6, 443). Perhaps Leibniz simply adopts the Cartesian\nstance\u2014that God is a sui generis cause, the likes of\nwhich we would be rash to think we can learn anything meaningful.\n\nUnlike Descartes, however, Leibniz does try to explain how God acts on\ncreatures: \u201ccreated substances depend on God, who conserves them\nand even produces them continually by a kind of emanation as we\nproduce our thoughts\u201d (Discourse on Metaphysics\n\u00a714 GP iv 439/PM 26). This suggests Leibniz\u2019s preferred way\nof reconciling God\u2019s creation and concurrence with creaturely\nactivity. Continual creation is to be understood in terms of\nGod\u2019s emanative activity. Emanation is how God sustains the\nactivity of substances.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s appeal to emanation needs some explanation and\ndefense, however. Jonathan Bennett, for one, finds this idea\n\u201castonishing\u201d:\n\nWhen we \u201cproduce our thoughts,\u201d we cause some alteration\nin ourselves; that is, our thoughts \u201cemanate from our\nsubstance\u201d only because the substance has the thoughts, just as\nfaces have blushes, bowls have shapes, and so on. Leibniz\u2019s\ncomparison implies that God\u2019s conserving us is his causing\nhimself to be in some state, which then implies that we are not\nseparate substances, but rather states or modes of God. Leibniz would\nreject that, calling it \u201cSpinozism.\u201d I do not understand\nhis offering a comparison which so obviously implies it. (Bennett,\n245)\n\n\nIt us debatable whether Bennett fully grasps Leibniz\u2019s analogy.\nThe point of Leibniz\u2019s analogy between substantial thought or\nperception and God\u2019s conservation is to reveal two important\naspects of emanation: (1) that God\u2019s causal influence on us is\ncontinual (just as substances always perceive); and (2) that this\ninfluence does not diminish God\u2019s causal power (just as thinking\ndoes not seem to diminish our ability to think) (Mercer, 189).\n\nSince a substance is more perfect than its mental states, the power of\na substance is in no way diminished when it perceives or thinks. The\nactive principle in a substance offers thoughts to\nitself\u2014thoughts produced by emanation (Mercer, 325, 366f). A\nthird aspect of emanation is equally important: Neither the emanator\n(God) nor the emanatee (created substance) is diminished causally. We\ncan attribute to Leibniz the following view: God\u2019s role in\nintrasubstantial causation, besides that which is implied by\nmiraculous intervention, is an emanatory one (Discourse on\nMetaphysics \u00a728; New Essays A, 6, 210f). An\nemanative mode of causal activity is one in which the cause includes,\nin some \u201ceminent\u201d or higher form, what it gives to its\neffect, without losing the ability to produce the same kind of effect\nin the future. But a substance, undergoing this kind of intervention\nor causal process, need not lose its natural causal efficacy. So I\nthink that Bennett misses the main implication of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics \u00a714 passage; the implication is not\nthat we are modes of God, but that our causal agency is analogous to\nGod\u2019s. Causally speaking at least, we are made in the image of\nGod. (This feature of emanation also reveals one shortcoming of\nJeffrey McDonough\u2019s otherwise excellent analogy of divine\ncontinual creation. McDonough points out that \u201cmy freezer can be\nthought of as creating and conserving particular ice cubes through a\nsingle continuous action that begins when a tray of water is put in\nthe ice box, and ends when the cubes are removed\u201d (McDonough,\n2007, 50). This analogy nicely captures the concurrence of continual\ncreation but it fails to capture the non-entropic nature of such\ncreation, for freezers are certainly not 100% efficient.)\n\nThere is another problematic aspect of Bennett\u2019s analysis of\nLeibniz\u2019s thought analogy. He seems to suggest that something\nthat has causal power must necessarily have productive causal power.\nBennett asks rhetorically: If we are to God as our thoughts are to\nourselves, then how can we produce anything? But it would be a mistake\nto think that Leibniz would concur with such an inference. In fact,\nLeibniz probably would not, since final causes clearly figure into his\naccount of the causal power of created substances: \u201cperceptions\nin the monad arise from one another by the laws of appetites, or by\nthe laws of the final causes of good and evil, which consist in\nnotable perceptions, ordered or disordered\u201d (Principles of\nNature and Grace \u00a73 GP vi 598/AG 207). These appear to be\ngenuine causes in Leibniz\u2019s metaphysics, giving potency to\ncreated substances, and helping serve to \u201cdistinguish the\nactions of God from those of creatures\u201d (Discourse on\nMetaphysics \u00a78); however, echoing Aristotle, final causes\nare not productive causes. There is a general moral to be gleaned here\nas well. Unless Leibniz indicates otherwise, it is a mistake to equate\ncausal power and activity with productive or efficient causality. (Not\nsurprisingly, there is a further complication here. For, as we will\nsee in the next section, at least one commentator thinks that for\nLeibniz some final causes are actually efficient.)\n\nLeibniz wants to reconcile continual creation with creaturely causal\npower and activity in order to defend concurrentism, and now we can\nsee that a promising answer (at least as a way of understanding\nLeibniz) is to understand continual creation as a kind of emanation.\nEmanation seems compatible with God\u2019s \u201ccontinual\ncreation\u201d (that is, immediate and direct causal influence on and\ncontinual production of all things) and the power, activity and so\n(relative) autonomy of created substances. In other words, continual\ncreation need not be understood as an occasionalist doctrine. But in\nwhat sense precisely are created substances genuine causes? What\ngrounds the causal power, activity, and (relative) autonomy of\ncreatures? We need to gain a better sense of Leibniz\u2019s account\nof intrasubstantial or immanent causality.\n",
