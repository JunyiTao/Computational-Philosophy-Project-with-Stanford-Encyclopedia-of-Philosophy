    "main_text": "States and Sovereignty\n3. States and Sovereignty\n\nThe criteria for determining the existence of statehood are\nwell-established in customary international law (Crawford 1979 [2006:\n38]). They are: a defined territory, a permanent population, an\neffective government, the capacity to enter into relations with other\nStates, and independence. Each of these criteria is related to an\nequally fundamental aspect of international law and inter-state\nrelations: sovereignty. The relationship between sovereignty and\nstatehood is crucial in both legal philosophy and international legal\npractice. Although some consider sovereignty to be coextensive with\nindependence, James Crawford\u2019s seminal work on statehood\nmaintains that whereas independence is a prerequisite for statehood,\nsovereignty \u201chas another more satisfactory meaning as an\nincident or consequence of statehood\u201d (Crawford 1979 [2006:\n89]). This section will explore the various aspects of this\n\u201cmore satisfactory meaning.\u201d\n\nSovereignty can be viewed as the ultimate authority that derives from,\nand attaches to, statehood. On the international plane, though\ninternational organizations exercise some functions normally\nassociated with States, it is traditionally only States that have been\ndescribed as sovereign. This may now be changing as some argue that\nthe European Union, for example, possesses a kind of sovereignty, with\nits member States now being sovereign in a different,\n\u201clate\u201d or post-national, sense (MacCormick 1993 [2006: 4,\n16]; Walker 2003, 9). On the domestic plane, the position is more\ncomplicated given that a larger number of subjects\u2014from monarchs\nto parliaments, from individuals to peoples\u2014have, at various\npoints and in different ways, been considered sovereign (Verdirame\n2016).\n",
