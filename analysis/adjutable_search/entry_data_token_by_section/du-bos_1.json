Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting\n\nCritical Reflections on Poetry and Painting begins with an\ninvestigation of the \u201cstriking pleasure (94)\u201d that humans\nreceive from the experience of poetry and painting. (All references to\nthe Critical Reflections are to pages of Du Bos 1719/2021.)\nThe book focuses on the two fine arts mentioned in the book\u2019s\ntitle, but Du Bos also discusses sculpture, engraving, dance, and\nmusic. According to Du Bos, we receive pleasure from the fine arts\nbecause works of art are imitations of objects in the world.\nPresumably, on Du Bos\u2019s view, the similarity between imitations\nand the objects imitated is responsible for the arousal of emotion.\nWhen we experience imitations, we receive emotions similar to, but\nless intense than, the emotions we feel when we experience the objects\nimitated. If these emotions are pleasing, Du Bos has an account of the\npleasure that humans receive from experience of the fine arts.\n\nDu Bos\u2019s account of the striking pleasure that we receive from\nthe fine arts commits him to the ancient view that the fine arts are\nimitative arts. This view is traceable to Plato and Aristotle and Du\nBos acknowledges these ancient sources. Although the view that the\nfine arts make up a coherent \u2018system\u2019 is sometimes\nattributed to Charles Batteux (Kristeller 1951; 1952), Du Bos\u2019s\nviews clearly anticipate those of Batteux (Young 2015).\n\nAccording to Du Bos, all arts are imitative, but the arts do not all\nrepresent in the same way. In the course of the Critical\nReflections, Du Bos makes a contribution to philosophy of\nlanguage by distinguishing between natural signs and the artificial\nsigns found in language. Natural signs, such as those found in\npainting, sculpture, and music, represent because they resemble their\nobjects. The artificial signs of language are arbitrary or\nconventional. They are employed in poetry (that is, literature).\n\nDu Bos asks which of the arts is best able to arouse emotions. He\nbelieves that painting has an advantage over poetry on the grounds\nthat natural signs affect us more effectively. He argues, however,\nthat poetry when combined with music or acting (or both, as in opera)\nhas an advantage over painting.\n\nDu Bos is aware that his account of the pleasure we receive from art\nfaces a serious objection. When the emotions we receive from viewing\nan imitation are positive, Du Bos\u2019s account has a prima facie\nplausibility. Sometimes, however, as he recognizes, we receive\nunpleasant emotions from the experience of artistic imitations. Du Bos\nconsiders, for example, an imitation of the sacrifice of\nJephthah\u2019s daughter and Le Brun\u2019s painting, Massacre\nof the Innocents. These works arouse negative emotions.\nNevertheless, we willingly, even enthusiastically, experience the\nworks. Our willingness to experience works that arouse negative\nemotions is often referred to as the paradox of tragedy.\n\nDu Bos tries to resolve the paradox by making two points. He begins by\nsaying that, although imitations of unpleasant events will arouse\nunpleasant emotions, these emotions are not as intense or as enduring\nas we receive from experience of the events themselves. This point\ncannot, by itself, resolve the paradox. Du Bos\u2019s second point is\nthat although the emotions aroused by imitations of unpleasant events\nare unpleasant, they are preferable to an emotion that we would\notherwise feel. According to Du Bos, we are constitutionally subject\nto a feeling of deep ennui. This ennui is not merely boredom. Rather\nit is a weariness of the human condition.\n\nIn \u2018On Tragedy,\u2019 Hume endorses Du Bos\u2019s solution to\nthe paradox, at least up to a point. Hume notes that, according to Du\nBos, \u201cnothing is in general so disagreeable to the mind as the\nlanguid, listless state of indolence, into which it falls upon the\nremoval of all passion and occupation.\u201d Hume then adds that,\nwhen a work of tragic art arouses an emotion \u201cLet it be\ndisagreeable, afflicting, melancholy, disordered; it is still better\nthan\u2026insipid languor\u201d (Hume 1757, 217). Some contemporary\nphilosophers have also found merit in Du Bos\u2019s approach to the\nparadox of tragedy (Livingston 2013).\n\nLater in the Critical Reflections Du Bos returns to the\nparadox of tragedy and gives a rather different solution. This later\npassage is apparently influenced by Aristotle\u2019s Poetics\nsince Du Bos speaks of the purging of emotions. He means by this,\nhowever, something other than Aristotle meant. According to Du Bos,\n\u201cThe faithful depiction of the passions suffices to make us\nafraid and make us resolve to avoid them with all of the determination\nof which we are capable\u201d (318). For example, we watch a\nperformance of Medea and we are horrified by the passion for\nvengeance and resolve not to indulge in it.\n\nThe concept of sentiments is crucial to Du Bos\u2019s thought. He\nseems to have been the writer who made talk of sentiments so\ncommonplace in eighteenth-century aesthetics. Du Bos never precisely\ndefines what he means when he speaks of sentiments. In what is,\nperhaps, the closest he comes to a definition he writes that,\n\u201cThe first ideas born in the soul, when it receives a lively\nstimulus,\u2026we call sentiments\u201d (237). According\nto Du Bos, sentiments are not produced by a special sort of aesthetic\nexperience. Rather, they are, as already indicated, ordinary emotional\nresponses. We can receive sentiments from experience of ordinary\nobjects and from experience of the imitations found in art. The\ndifference, as already noted, is that sentiments produced by art are\nfainter.\n\nDespite believing that sentiments are ordinary emotions or fainter\ncopies of them, Du Bos posits a sense of beauty. He writes that,\n\u201cWe have in us a sense intended to judge the value of works that\nimitate touching objects in nature\u201d and calls this a\n\u201csixth sense\u201d (519). Du Bos compares the sense of beauty\nto gustatory taste and seems to have been among the first writers to\ndo so.\n\nSince artistic imitations are intended to arouse emotions similar to\nthose aroused by the objects imitated, Du Bos values what he calls\nvraisemblance (verisimilitude). Painters, for example, must\n\u201cmake a painting consistent with what we know of the customs,\nhabits, architecture, and arms of the people that one intends to\nrepresent\u201d (226). A work can, however, be vraisemblable\nwithout being an imitation of the real world and historical events. A\nwork can be vraisemblable and yet be an example of what Du\nBos calls \u201cthe marvelous\u201d. An opera, for example, can be\nvraisemblable even though it depicts marvelous ancient Greek\ngods and goddesses. It must, however, depict them as existing in a way\nthat gods and goddesses can exist. Vraisemblance is not an\nend in itself as it was for some earlier thinkers. The real goal of\nthe arts is to arouse sentiments and vraisemblance is only a\nmeans of doing so.\n\nAccording to Du Bos, we judge artworks by means of our sentiments\nrather than by means of reason. He rejects the rationalist school of\ncriticism associated with writers such as Roland Fr\u00e9art de\nChambray (1606\u201476), the author of L\u2019Id\u00e9e de la\nperfection de la peinture demonstr\u00e9e par les principles de\nl\u2019art (1662) and Jean Terrasson, whose work\nDissertation critique sur l\u2019Iliade d\u2019Homere\nappeared in 1715. Terrasson wrote that the \u201cproper and natural\nprinciple by which we must judge a work of literature [belles\nlettres] is the real conformity that it must have with good\nreason and belle nature; this is philosophy\u201d (Terrason\n1715, iv). He adds that this philosophy comes from Descartes and\n\u201cthe spirit of our philosophy is not limited to works of natural\nscience [physique]; the pulpit, the courts and even poetry\nfeel it\u2026.[modern philosophy] submits everything to\nreason\u201d (Terrason 1715, lxi). In a similar vein, Bosse wrote\nthat the \u201cnoble art of painting must be based for the\nmost part on correct and rule-governed reasoning, which is to say,\ngeometrical and, consequently, demonstrative\u201d (Bosse 1649,\nsommaire). Du Bos mocks these writers as \u2018geometrical\ncritics.\u2019\n\nHe writes that the evaluation of art \u201cis not left to reason. It\nmust submit to the judgement that sentiment pronounces. Sentiment is\nthe competent judge of this issue.\u201d He goes on to compare the\nevaluation of an artwork to making a judgement about a ragout. Reason\nis of no use here. Rather, \u201cWe taste the ragout and\u2026we\nknow that it is good. It is the same with works of wit and pictures\nmade to please us by touching us\u201d (519).\n\nIn making sentiments the means by which artworks are judged, Du Bos\ngave rise to a question that he did not fully appreciate and certainly\ndid not solve. This is the question of providing a standard of taste.\nDu Bos is a subjectivist. He makes the value of an artwork a\nresponse-dependent property. A work of art is valuable if it arouses\ncertain valuable sentiments in audience members. Du Bos was aware that\ndifferent works will arouse different pleasing sentiments in different\npeople:\n\nTo want to persuade a man who prefers colour to expression, in\naccordance with his own feelings, that he is wrong, is to want to\npersuade him to take more pleasure in seeing Poussin\u2019s paintings\nthan Titian\u2019s. The matter depends no more on him than it does on\na man, whose palate is formed in such a way as to prefer champagne to\nSpanish wine, to change his taste and prefer the Spanish wine to\nFrench (345).\n\n\nThe problem, as Hume clearly recognized, was that not everyone\nreceives the same sentiments from a work of art. This leads to the\nconclusion that a work has value for some people and not for others.\nHowever, as Hume also recognized, thorough-going subjectivism is\ncounterintuitive. It seems that there is a fact that Milton is a\ngreater poet than Ogilby, even if some people prefer Ogilby.\n\nDu Bos was unaware of the full extent of the problem caused by\nsubjectivism. Likely this was because he believed that everyone has\nvery much the same sentiments. In fact, he believed that the general\npublic was the best judge of the value of artworks because their taste\nwas least corrupted by prejudice.\n\nDu Bos also proposes the test of time. When a work of art repeatedly\npleases audiences over a long period of time, this is conclusive\nevidence that it is a work of high value. Du Bos point out, for\nexample, that the reputations of the best Greek and Roman poets are\nfirmly established since they have pleased audiences through the\nages.\n\nSome writers, Du Bos was aware, believe that artworks can be valuable\nas a source of knowledge. At times Du Bos indicates that there is\nsomething to this, and that art is valuable as more than the source of\nvaluable sentiments. In the end, however, his considered opinion is\nthat, \u201cWe can acquire some knowledge by reading a poem, but this\nis scarcely the motive for opening the book\u201d (244).\n\nDu Bos speaks about audience members\u2019 states of mind but he also\nspeaks of the artist\u2019s state of mind. Artists, he believes, feel\nthe emotions that their works arouse in audience members. Indeed, the\nartist\u2019s \u201cgoal is to make us share his sentiments\u201d\n(354). The difference between the artist\u2019s state of mind, and\nthose of audience members, is that the artist\u2019s sentiments are\nmore intense. Artists must be in a state of \u201centhusiasm\u201d\nif they are to create successful works of art. This enthusiasm can\nborder on madness. Since Du Bos believes that artists convey their\nemotions to their audiences, he is an early advocate of an expression\ntheory of the arts.\n\nThe Critical Reflections make a contribution to the Quarrel\nof the Ancients and Moderns. This was a long running debate about the\nrelative merits of ancient and modern writers and artists. Du\nBos\u2019s contribution to the debate is judicious. He reaches the\nconclusion that modern sculptors have not surpassed their ancient\ncounterparts. With regard to painting, he says that it is difficult to\nreach a judgement since so few ancient paintings have survived.\nNevertheless, he thinks it unlikely that modern painters have\nsurpassed the ancients. Ancient poets have a significant edge over\nmodern ones. Du Bos allows that, in the natural sciences, modern\nscientists have eclipsed the ancients.\n\nMuch of Du Bos\u2019s book is devoted to an explanation of artistic\ngenius. He is particularly concerned to explain why certain eras (the\nGolden Age of Athens, the Rome of Augustus, the Italian Renaissance,\nand the era of Louis XIV) are more productive of geniuses. Although Du\nBos says, in passing, that a \u201cpoet needs divine\ninspiration\u201d (241), he decisively rejects the Platonic\nconception of genius. Instead, he believes that genius has physical\ncauses. In part, genius is to be explained by physiological\nconsiderations. According to Du Bos, a genius has a well-formed brain\nand other physiological advantages over other people. Most\nimportantly, he believes, genius is the result of certain\nenvironmental factors. These factors include climate, air quality,\nsoil, and diet. For example, England is supposedly unable to produce\npainters of the first rank because the climate is too cold. Although\nhighly influential in the eighteenth century, Du Bos\u2019s views on\ngenius have been supplanted. Nevertheless, Du Bos\u2019s views on\ngenius are noteworthy as an early effort to provide a scientific\nexplanation of genius.\n\nAlthough Du Bos was primarily concerned with poetry and painting, he\nmade a significant contribution to philosophy of music. He was an\nadvocate of the resemblance theory of musical expression. According to\nthis theory, music is expressive of emotions because it resembles\nhuman expressive behavior. This view is found, in the contemporary\nworld, in Davies (1994) and Kivy (1980). (See the article on\nPhilosophy of Music, 3.1.) Music can resemble either vocal or\nnon-vocal expressive behavior. It can resemble, for example, the\nplodding steps of a sad person or the joyful cries of a happy one.\nBecause music resembles such expressive behavior, it is heard as sad,\njoyful, or expressive of some other emotion.\n\nIn the Critical Reflections, the resemblance theory is\ncrucial in explaining how music can be, like painting and poetry, an\nimitative art. It does so by resembling and, consequently, imitating\n\u201cnatural signs of the passions\u201d. Du Bos also believes that\nmusic can imitate sounds in nature. He writes that \u201cThere is\ntruth in a symphony, composed to imitate a tempest, when the music of\nthe symphony, its harmony and its rhythm, make us hear a noise similar\nto the tumult of the wind and the roaring waves, which clash with each\nother or break against the rocks\u201d (323). (Here the word\n\u2018symphony\u2019 means instrumental music. It does not refer to\na symphony in the modern sense of the word.) Notice that, on Du\nBos\u2019s view, even purely instrumental music can be imitative.\n\nUnlike some modern advocates of the resemblance theory, Du Bos\nbelieves that the experience of musical imitations arouses emotion.\nMusic arouses emotions in very much the same way that poetry and\npainting do. The emotion aroused will be the emotion that would be\naroused by the object represented.\n\nDu Bos\u2019s prose is often execrable. Voltaire wrote, with\nreference to Du Bos and the Critical Reflections, that,\n\u201cthe judgement is good, the style bad. It is necessary to read\nhim, but re-reading him would be tiresome\u201d (Voltaire\nCorrespondence, letter 3917). An English translation of the\nCritical Reflections was published in the eighteenth century.\nThomas Nugent translated the book as Critical Reflections on\nPoetry, Painting and Music (Du Bos 1748). Unfortunately, this\ntranslation is inaccurate and preserves all of the problems of the\noriginal French. A new translation (Du Bos 1719/2021) recently\nappeared. \n",
