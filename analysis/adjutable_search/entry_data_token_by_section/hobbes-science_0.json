    "main_text": "The Criteria for Scientific Knowledge\n1. The Criteria for Scientific Knowledge\n\nThe fundamental aspects of Hobbes\u2019 materialism are well known.\nHobbes believed that everything that exists is a body, and that bodies\nare sometimes in motion and sometimes at rest. Furthermore, he held\nthat the only essential property of body is extension, or magnitude.\nAll other apparent properties of bodies, such as those of color,\ntaste, and firmness, are the result of motions from bodies being\ncontinued through media to humans\u2019 sense organs. These motions,\nwhen continued into the bodies of perceivers, are constitutive of\nconceptions, or\n ideas.[2]\n Ideas of the objects of sense are caused by motions from things\noutside of perceivers and those continued motions constitute ideas and\nserve to individuate one idea from another. Thus, all ideas in the\nhuman mind are either from sense perception or derived from ideas\ngained from sense perception (Leviathan I; LEV 22).\n\nThis account of the origin and nature of ideas shows Hobbes\u2019\nclear empiricist leanings; however, Hobbes does not hold that knowers\nshould uncritically accept what the ideas of sense objects seem to\nrepresent. Like many other philosophers in the seventeenth century,\nHobbes held that our knowledge of the external world was not direct\nbut was instead mediated by ideas. This recognition that \u201cwe\ncompute nothing but our phantasms or ideas\u201d (Hobbes\n1642\u201343 [1973: 450]; cf. OL\n I.82)[3]\n resulted in two worries about human knowledge.\n\nFirst, knowers must examine what resemblance ideas in the mind have to\nobjects in the outside world. This worry seems similar, at first\nglance, to the concerns of Descartes\u2019 meditator in the\nMeditations on First Philosophy (1641), but Hobbes aimed to\nprovide a solution that made no reference whatsoever to God or to\nanything at all immaterial, such as a soul. In the early work\nElements of Law, composed in 1640 and published in 1650 (EL),\nHobbes offered arguments that attempted to show that ideas are\ndistinct from that which they purport to represent, and he claimed\nthat as a result we could know that the so-called secondary qualities,\nsuch as color, taste, and sound, were not in bodies. To do this, he\nused everyday experience to provide evidence for his claims:\n\n\nEvery man hath so much experience as to have seen the sun and other\nvisible objects by reflection in the water and in glasses, and this\nalone is sufficient for this conclusion: that colour and image may be\nthere where the thing seen is not. (Elements of Law II.5; EL\n3)\n\n\nHe used similar considerations in Leviathan I, concluding\nthat we can know, for example, that color and sound are not in bodies\nsince if they were \u201cthey could not bee severed from them, as by\nglasses, and in Ecchoes by reflection\u201d (LEV 24).\n\nA second worry that follows from Hobbes\u2019 view that we have only\nmediated access to bodies in the world relates to the possibility of\ngaining knowledge of the causes of natural events. Most of the ideas\nthat knowers possess of bodies are received passively. When interested\nin the cause of some phenomenon, all one may examine are ideas caused\nby the motions of the bodies involved. However, when interested in,\nsay, the cause of billiard ball B being put into motion after\napparent contact with moving billiard ball A, one does not\nfind an idea of A being the cause of B\u2019s\nmotion. Even if one were to look to a lower \u2018level\u2019, as it\nwere, smaller than billiard balls by use of a microscope, one would\nnot find any idea of A\u2019s motion causing\nB\u2019s motion. Hobbes diagnosed this lack of causal\nknowledge by highlighting that human agents are not the makers of\nnatural phenomena. He thought that makers gain this causal knowledge\nby attending to their constructions through the process of creating\nsomething. Since we lack the ideas of the causes of individual\nphenomena from our experience, Hobbes claimed that we cannot know\ntheir actual causes at all. All that we may know are possible causes.\nHobbes asserted in Six Lessons to the Professors of\nMathematiques (1656) that because \u201cof natural bodies we\nknow not the construction but seek it from the effects\u201d we can\nknow \u201conly of what [the causes] may be\u201d (EW VII.184).\n\nThis second worry brings to the fore Hobbes\u2019 condition for the\npossibility of scientific knowledge, namely, the possession of\n(actual) causal knowledge. He claimed that\n\n\nwe are said to know [scire] some effect when we know what its\ncauses are, in what subject they are, in what subject they introduce\nthe effect and how they do it. Therefore, this is the knowledge\n[scientia] \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\n\u03b4\u03b9\u1f79\u03c4\u03b9 or of causes. (OL I.59)\n\n\nHaving scientific knowledge required one to know the actual causes of\na phenomenon, not its mere possible causes. However, the only way to\npossess such causal knowledge is to act as a maker, as God did in the\ncase of natural things.\n\nThis restriction that Hobbes made allowed him to consider only\ngeometry and civil philosophy as bodies of scientific knowledge, since\nin only these two disciplines do humans make the objects that they\nstudy. In Six Lessons to the Professors of Mathematiques,\nHobbes distinguished these two disciplines from all others by\nconnecting them to making:\n\n\nGeometry therefore is demonstrable for the lines and figures from\nwhich we reason are drawn and described by ourselves and civil\nphilosophy is demonstrable because we make the commonwealth ourselves.\n(EW VII.184)\n\n\nIn the three following sections, this entry considers ways in which\nthese two bodies of scientific knowledge are used within other\ndisciplines to provide an epistemic grounding for the explanations\ntherein. In natural philosophy, or physics, Hobbes borrowed\ngeometrical principles to provide the cause\u2014the reason\n\u2018why\u2019\u2014for many phenomena, while the making of the\ncommonwealth, and its laws, out of the state of nature was the genesis\nof the science of civil philosophy.\n",
