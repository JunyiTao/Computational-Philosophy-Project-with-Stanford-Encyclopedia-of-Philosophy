    "main_text": "Philo and Philosophical Schools || Philo and Aristotelianism\n3.1 Philo and Aristotelianism\n\nAs Roskam (2011: 35) underscored, \n\n\nthe period of Middle Platonism is particularly interesting because it\nis in this period that Aristotle begins to receive more and more\nattention in the circles of a systematised Platonism. \n\n\nThis does not mean that the rivalry between Platonists and\nAristotelians was over, but rather that Aristotle, who seems to have\nbeen largely ignored by Neo-Academic philosophers during the\nHellenistic period (but Weische 1961), emerged again as a reference\nand a point of discussion. Philo is full of praise towards the\nStagirite in the De aeternitate, a puzzling text. He was\nhimself a Creationist while Aristotle asserted the eternity of the\nworld. This does not mean that his admiration was unbounded,\nespecially if the original treatise had been in the form of an\nantilogy, a disputatio in utramque partem. Today, some\nscholars try to demonstrate that Aristotle, more than Plato, lay at\nthe core of Philo\u2019s thought (Bos 2009). It can be objected that\nthe dogmatic Academic Antiochus of Ascalon (ca\n140/130\u201360 BCE), a philosopher that Philo certainly had read,\ndid much to intertwine Platonic, Stoic, and Aristotelian ideas (Sedley\n2012). The influence of Antiochus on the Alexandrian philosophical\nmilieu is a controversial question. Despite the efforts of Andronicus\nof Rhodes (first editor of the Aristotelian corpus) to organize the\ncorpus, some of the texts used Aristotelian elements in a spirit quite\ndifferent from what we now understand by Aristotelianism. This can\nshed light on our understanding of Philo\u2019s Aristotelianism and\non the comparison of his Aristotelian passages with the\npseudo-Aristotelian ones, a point on which many have commented.\nAntiochus was not the only one to shift the borders between these\ndoctrines. The Stoic Posidonius also played a role in Philo\u2019s\nelaboration of an unorthodox form of Aristotelianism.\n\nEven if one is persuaded of the authenticity of Philo\u2019s\nAristotelianism in the De aeternitate mundi, the compliments\ntowards Aristotle at the beginning of the treatise are surprising and\ndo not exactly fit within the traditional frame of a disputatio\npro and contra. The most probable thesis was put in\nsecond position, as we can see in the Ciceronian antilogy on justice\nin the third book of the De re publica. Another ambiguity is\nthat Aristotle is praised here for having referred to the visible God,\nwhile Philo says many times elsewhere that God is invisible. Of this\noddity two contradictory interpretations may be given: either Philo\nmeans that Aristotle as a philosopher is what Israel is among the\nnations, the one able to see God, an etymology of which Philo is fond;\nor the reference to the \u201cvisible God\u201d, without any\nreference to His essence, means that Aristotle is only able to see the\nvisible aspects of Him. This would be an implicit criticism of the\nStagirite\u2019s incapacity to perceive God\u2019s transcendental\nand divine Nature.\n\nThe above is but one example of the difficulties inherent to the\ninterpretation of Aristotelian elements in Philo\u2019s corpus, at\nleast regarding cosmological and metaphysical problems. Things are\nperhaps clearer concerning Aristotle\u2019s influence on\nPhilo\u2019s ethics. The term mesot\u00e8s (middle way),\nwhich has special importance in Aristotelian ethics, is used by Philo\nonce, in Migr. 147. In this passage, the Alexandrine argues\nthat the \u201croyal road\u201d is the middle way. But this\nassertion is not an unrestricted sign of approval of Aristotle\u2019s\nethics. In the desert, there is no way at all\u2014and the desert was\nthe exact place where Israel received the Revelation and achieved its\nliberty. The middle way may play a positive role in reining in\ndebauchery, but for Philo, it has no absolute value. In Leg.\n3.20, Laban asks Jacob why he fled instead of remaining faithful to\nthe doctrine that recognizes the goods of the body and external\npossessions. Here is evidence of Philo\u2019s refusal to accept\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine of the three kinds of goods. In\nDet. 8, it is said that corporeal and external goods are\nassets in name only, and in Somn. 2.9, he criticizes those\nwho upheld the tripartition of human goods and contrasts them with\nthose for whom virtue was the only good. To summarize, Philo could\noccasionally borrow some elements of Peripatetic doctrine, but he\nnever believed them to be an expression of higher truth. He reveals a\nparticular sort of coherence with regard to Aristotelianism: it\nconsists in demonstrating through exegesis that Aristotle\u2019s\nprudent philosophy could not entirely coincide with the Bible\u2019s\nspiritual wisdom.\n",
