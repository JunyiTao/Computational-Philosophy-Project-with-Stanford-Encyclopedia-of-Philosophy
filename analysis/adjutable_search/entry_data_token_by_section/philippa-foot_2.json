    "main_text": "Against Moral Rationalism\n3. Against Moral Rationalism\n\nAmong Foot\u2019s most anthologized, celebrated, controversial, and\nwidely cited articles is undoubtedly \u201cMorality as a System of\nHypothetical Imperatives\u201d (1972, MSHI). In this article, Foot\ntakes an about-face on the issue of the rationality of morality. In\nMSHI she retains the view from \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d that\nself-interest is rationally required: we must have desires for what is\nevidently in our self-interest or else we are irrational. Yet, she\ndrops the view that morality coincides with self-interest, and ends up\nwith the position that morality only provides reasons if we have\ndesires that we might rationally lack. Unfortunately, although Foot\nnotes her change of view, she does not revisit her previous position\nto argue at any length against her earlier\n view.[3]\n\nThe term \u2018hypothetical imperative\u2019 comes from Immanuel\nKant\u2019s moral philosophy, in which it is contrasted with the\n\u2018categorical imperative\u2019. A hypothetical imperative is a\ncommand, or ought-statement, that depends for its reason-giving force\non the agent having a certain purpose. For example, someone\u2019s\nability to say that I ought to purchase an airplane ticket to New York\ntoday typically depends on whether I have the purpose of going there.\nIf I lack that purpose, or give up on it, then there is no sense in\nwhich one could continue to maintain that I ought to buy the ticket.\nBy contrast, categorical imperatives do not depend on our possession\nof any special purpose for their reason-giving force; they have\nnormative authority for us regardless of our purposes. In MSHI Foot\nsets out to challenge the then widely held assumption that morality\nmust consist of categorical imperatives because whether something is\nyour moral obligation seems obviously not to depend on whether one has\na certain purpose or desire. She undertakes to show that the surface\ngrammar of moral judgments, stating what we ought morally to do, is\nmisleading; when we make claims about what someone ought morally to\ndo, we certainly appear to be making categorical claims. We tell\nchildren that they should not fib even when a successful fib would\nserve their overriding purpose of escaping blame or punishment. Yet\nFoot argues that this appearance is deceptive, making her case for\nthis point by drawing an analogy between morality and etiquette. \n\nEtiquette and morality are different in many ways, but they both tell\nus what we ought to do. In fact, as Foot points out, rules of\netiquette are usually presented in the same categorical form as moral\nconsiderations; etiquette tells us what must and must not be done,\nperiod. Imperatives such as, \u201cYou should not discuss\nmoney\u201d, or \u201cDon\u2019t make personal remarks\u201d use a\ncategorical form. Foot calls these \u201cnon-hypothetical uses\u201d\nof ought (1972 [VV 160]). Yet Foot takes it to be obvious that one can\nrationally ignore the rules of etiquette. Hence, the rules of\netiquette do not give me any reason to act on them unless I have the\npurpose of doing what I ought to do from the point of view of\netiquette. Of course, there is still a sense in which the rules of\netiquette are unconditional. I am \u2018gauche\u2019 if I flout the\nrequirements of etiquette, regardless of my purposes. Still, Foot\nthinks it cannot be said that I necessarily have reason to conform to\nthose rules, drawing the conclusion that \n\n\nif a hypothetical use of \u2018should\u2019 gave a hypothetical\nimperative, and a non-hypothetical use of \u2018should\u2019 gave a\ncategorical imperative, then \u2018should\u2019 statements based on\nrules of etiquette, or rules of a club would be categorical\nimperatives. (1972 [VV 160\u2013161]) \n\n\nYet these \u2018should\u2019 statements do not really give us\ncategorical imperatives. We therefore cannot trust the surface grammar\nof our \u2018should\u2019 or \u2018ought\u2019 statements to tell\nus whether we have a categorical or a hypothetical imperative.\n\nFoot sees the commands of morality as like those of etiquette. Though\nthey are stated in categorical form, there is no reason to think that\nsomeone who acts against them is necessarily irrational. It is\nperfectly plausible to think that they give reasons only if we have\nthe purpose of doing what we should do from the moral point of view.\nAs with etiquette, the claims of morality are, in some sense,\nunconditional: one does not escape being wicked simply by lacking the\npurpose of being moral. As Foot states, \n\n\nthe man who rejects morality because he sees no reason to obey its\nrules can be convicted of villainy but not of inconsistency. (1972 [VV\n161])\n\n\n\nThat is because such an amoral agent does not act against any purpose\nthat he has, and is therefore not irrational, though he is still\nimmoral.\n\nThe next question that Foot sets out to address is: what would be the\nimplications for morality if it turns out that rules of morality are\nhypothetical imperatives? Many think that this would be a catastrophic\nsituation. Kant, for example, thought that if morality were merely\nhypothetically imperative, we would only be moral when it served\nselfish and pleasure-seeking purposes. Yet Foot argues that Kant had\nan inadequate view of human psychology, stating, \n\n\nQuite apart from thoughts of duty a man may care about the suffering\nof others, having a sense of identification with them and wanting to\nhelp if he can. (1972 [VV 165]) \n\n\nOf course, helping others with the purpose of promoting one\u2019s\nreputation for charity is not compatible with the virtue of charity,\nbut one can simply desire to help others, and in that case, there is\nno need for a categorical imperative to prompt the charitable\nacts.\n\nJustice, as Foot realizes, cannot be motivated by the same concern for\nthe good of others. Justice notoriously comes into conflict with the\ngood of others, as there may be cases where people would be\nwell-served by a false accusation or the redistribution of money owed\nto a rich man to the poor. This leads Foot to posit that just persons\nare concerned with truth, liberty and that they \u201cwant every man\nto be treated with a certain respect\u201d ([1972 [VV 165]). On Foot\u2019s\nview, then, a morally good agent has a variety of independent\ncommitments which make considerations of the well-being and the rights\nof others yield reasons. She evidently thinks this is a plausible\npsychological picture that has not been given sufficient\nconsideration, due to the assumption that morality consists of\ncategorical imperatives.\n\nAt the conclusion of MSHI, Foot makes an even bolder claim. She\nimagines that those resistant to her claim will think that we have a\nduty to adopt moral ends, yet she thinks that the idea that we have a\nduty to have certain ends is complete nonsense. It is of course\ntrivially true that we ought morally to have moral ends; so\nthat from the perspective of morally good people, these ends appear to\nbe obligatory. However, the objection suggests a use of\n\u2018ought\u2019 that is not tied to any particular institution,\npractice, or person\u2019s perspective, and she thinks it is merely\nan illusion that there is any such sense of \u2018ought\u2019 ([1972\n[VV 167]). In this respect, Foot claims she is offering a\n\u2018defictionalized\u2019 vision of morality (1975 [VV 174]).\n\nFoot\u2019s middle period views on the rationality of morality have\nspurred much debate. Her views of this period leave morality\nalarmingly unsupported: there is no reason to develop the desires that\nallow moral considerations in turn to provide us with reasons for\naction if we lack them. Prominent defenders of moral rationalism\ncriticize Foot\u2019s analogy with etiquette. Unfortunately,\nFoot\u2019s actual position is sometimes misrepresented in the\ndebate. It is sometimes thought that Foot adopts at this point a\nwholly conventional view of morality, by analogy with etiquette. Yet,\nFoot did not renounce her earlier view that morality has some\ndeterminate content, tied to facts about human life. Another feature\nof Foot\u2019s middle period views that often gets overlooked is her\ncontinuous commitment to rationalism about self-interest:\nconsiderations of self-interest always provides reasons, regardless of\none\u2019s\n desires.[4]\n This means that she is not a consistent externalist, since not all\nreasons need to be accompanied by a desire that we might lack. Rather,\nshe defends an externalism about the reasons generated by moral\nconsiderations only. So she does not, after all, think that all\nnormative statements generate only hypothetical imperatives. Still,\nmoral oughts are not supported by categorical imperatives of\nself-interest, according to Foot\u2019s views at this point in her\ncareer.\n",
