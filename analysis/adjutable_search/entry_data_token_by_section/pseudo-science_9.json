    "main_text": "Alternative demarcation criteria || The logical positivists\n4.1 The logical positivists\n\nAround 1930, the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle developed\nvarious verificationist approaches to science. The basic idea was that\na scientific statement could be distinguished from a metaphysical\nstatement by being at least in principle possible to verify. This\nstandpoint was associated with the view that the meaning of a\nproposition is its method of verification (see the section on\nVerificationism in the entry on the\n Vienna Circle).\n This proposal has often been included in accounts of the demarcation\nbetween science and pseudoscience. However, this is not historically\nquite accurate since the verificationist proposals had the aim of\nsolving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that\nbetween science and metaphysics.\n",
