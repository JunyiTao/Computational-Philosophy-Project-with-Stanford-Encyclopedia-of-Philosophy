    "main_text": "\n\nIn ordinary political discourse, the \u201ccommon good\u201d refers\nto those facilities\u2014whether material, cultural or\ninstitutional\u2014that the members of a community provide to all\nmembers in order to fulfill a relational obligation they all have to\ncare for certain interests that they have in common. Some canonical\nexamples of the common good in a modern liberal democracy include: the\nroad system; public parks; police protection and public safety; courts\nand the judicial system; public schools; museums and cultural\ninstitutions; public transportation; civil liberties, such as the\nfreedom of speech and the freedom of association; the system of\nproperty; clean air and clean water; and national defense. The term\nitself may refer either to the interests that members have in common\nor to the facilities that serve common interests. For example, people\nmay say, \u201cthe new public library will serve the common\ngood\u201d or \u201cthe public library is part of the common\ngood\u201d.\n\nAs a philosophical concept, the common good is best understood as part\nof an encompassing model for practical reasoning among the members of\na political community. The model takes for granted that citizens stand\nin a \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201ccivic\u201d relationship with\none another and that this relationship requires them to create and\nmaintain certain facilities on the grounds that these facilities serve\ncertain common interests. The relevant facilities and interests\ntogether constitute the common good and serve as a shared standpoint\nfor political\n deliberation.[1]\n When citizens face various questions about legislation, public policy\nor social responsibility, they resolve these questions by appeal to a\nconception of the relevant facilities and the relevant interests. That\nis, they argue about what facilities have a special claim on their\nattention, how they should expand, contract or maintain existing\nfacilities, and what facilities they should design and build in the\nfuture.\n\nThe common good is an important concept in political philosophy\nbecause it plays a central role in philosophical reflection about the\npublic and private dimensions of social life. Let\u2019s say that\n\u201cpublic life\u201d in a political community consists of a\nshared effort among members to maintain certain facilities for the\nsake of common interests. \u201cPrivate life\u201d consists of each\nmember\u2019s pursuit of a distinct set of personal projects. As\nmembers of a political community, we are each involved in our\ncommunity\u2019s public life and in our own private lives, and this\nraises an array of questions about the nature and scope of each of\nthese enterprises. For example, when are we supposed to make decisions\nbased on the common good? Most of us would agree that we are required\nto do so when we act as legislators or civil servants. But what about\nas journalists, corporate executives or consumers? More fundamentally,\nwhy should we care about the common good? What would be wrong with a\ncommunity whose members withdraw from public life and focus\nexclusively on their own private lives? These are some of the\nquestions that motivate philosophical discussions of the common\ngood.\n\nThis article reviews the philosophical literature, covering various\npoints of agreement among traditional conceptions of the common good,\nsuch as those favored by Plato, Aristotle, John Locke,\nJ.J. Rousseau, Adam Smith, G.W.F. Hegel, John Rawls and Michael Walzer. It also\ncovers some important disagreements, especially the disagreement\nbetween \u201ccommunal\u201d and \u201cdistributive\u201d views.\nIt concludes by considering three important topics in the literature:\ndemocracy, communal sharing, and competitive markets. In order to\nunderstand the issues, it is helpful to start by distinguishing the\ncommon good from various notions of the good that play a prominent\nrole in welfare economics and welfare consequentialist accounts of\npolitical morality.\n",
