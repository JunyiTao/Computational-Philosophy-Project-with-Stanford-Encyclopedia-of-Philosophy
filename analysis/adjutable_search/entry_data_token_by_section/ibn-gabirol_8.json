    "main_text": "The Divine Creative Act || Will, Wisdom, Word, Intellect and the Cosmos\n4.2 Will, Wisdom, Word, Intellect and the Cosmos\n\n\nEarly on in the Fons Vitae, we learn that the Divine Will\nis one of three central concepts that the human mind must set out to\ngrasp (the workings of matter and form, and the reality of a divine\nEssence as primal cause are the other two central concepts). We also\nlearn of Will that it is some sort of cosmic \u201cintermediary\nbetween the extremes,\u201d a role described as central to the basic\nunderpinning of the universe (Fons Vitae 1.7, p. 9, lines\n28\u201330; see too Fons Vitae 5.36, p 322, line 20\u2013p. 323, line 1\nfor another statement of the three divisions of knowledge; in this\nlatter context, Will is identified with Word). We learn that Will is\nthe power of God infused in and penetrating through all things, that it\nis the power of unity in the universe, and that it is that which both\nbrings forth and moves all of existence. It is also described as the\ndivine force that maintains and sustains the essence of all things (see\nFons Vitae 5.39, p. 327, lines 14\u201315: Will is the power\n[virtus] of God infused in and penetrating all things; 5.39,\np. 327, lines 26\u201327: Will is the power [virtus] of unity; 1.2, p. 4,\nlines 14\u201315: Will is the divine power [virtus] bringing forth\nand moving all things; 1.5, p. 7, line 15: Will maintains and sustains\nthe essence of all things).\n\n\nTurning further to Will's mediating cosmic role, while the\nLatin text translates \u201cintermediary between the extremes,\u201d\nthe Arabic text uses a dual grammatical form, translating more\nspecifically as \u201cintermediary between the two extremes.\u201d In\nthe context of this claim, the \u201cintermediation\u201d role\nbetween the \u201ctwo extremes\u201d is ambiguous between two\ndifferent claims which are both equally true within the context of Ibn\nGabirol's worldview: on the one hand, Ibn Gabirol might mean that\nWill intermediates between (1) matter and form on the one hand and (2)\ndivine Essence on the other (the items corresponding to two of the\nthree \u201cdivisions of knowledge\u201d which he describes [see\nsection 5]); on the other hand, Ibn Gabirol might mean that Will\nintermediates between (1) matter and (2) form, the two cosmic\n\u201cbuilding blocks\u201d out of which all reality is\ncomprised.\n\n\nWill is further described as taking its own root in God's\nEssence, and is sometimes (but not always) described as the immediate\ncreative source of (and not just intermediary between) matter\nand\n form.[22]\nComplicating this picture of Will's creation of matter and form,\nwe also learn on the contrary that Will is the direct source only of\nform (and not\n matter)[23]\u2014a \npoint supported further by the claim\nthat Will is (1) identical to Wisdom (and the source of form; see\nFons Vitae 5.42, p. 335, lines 4\u20135), and (2) that Wisdom is\nthe source only of form (and not matter), with the divine Essence\nitself being the direct source of matter: \u201c\u2026materia\nest creata ab essentia, et forma est a proprietate essentiae, id est\nsapientia et unitate\u2026\u201d (\u201c\u2026matter is\ncreated from Essence, and form is from the property of Essence, viz.,\nfrom Wisdom and Unity\u2026\u201d; Fons Vitae 5.42, p.333,\nlines 4\u20135; see too 5.42, p. 335, lines 4\u20135).\n\n\nLeaving the complexities of these competing claims aside in the\ncontext of this study, it is sufficient here to emphasize that Ibn\nGabirol's theology includes a Divine Will not only responsible\nfor the generation of one or both of matter and form, but responsible\nin some way for the \u201cconnection between matter and form\u201d in\nall things, and, as such, responsible for sustaining all existing\nthings (all of which are, for Ibn Gabirol, form and matter composites;\nsee section 5). By sustaining the matter and form composition of all\nthings, Divine Will signifies the permeation of God's creative\nforce at the core of Being itself, and as such at the core of every\nindividual being.\n\n\nIn addition to identifying Will with Wisdom, Ibn Gabirol also\nidentifies Will with Word (Fons Vitae 5.36, p. 323, line 17).\nFollowing on this identification, in a rather evocative set of\npassages, Ibn Gabirol likens the act of creation to God's\nutterance of word (Fons Vitae 5.43). While this theme is\ncertainly not new within the history of Neoplatonic and Jewish ideas\n(suggesting resonance with the Longer Theology of\nAristotle's reference to the Word [Ar. kalima], as\nwell as resonance with S\u00eafer Yez\u00eerah's\nemphasis on God's creation via Hebrew\n letters[24]),\nwhat is new is Ibn\nGabirol's unique way of fleshing that idea out in light of his\noverall metaphysics: Creation, writes Ibn Gabirol, is like a word that\nGod utters, and that word is itself the coming together of voice (the\nuniversal matter), the audible sounds that make up a given word\n(manifest forms), and the actual meaning of the word (the hidden\nuniversal form which contains and sustains all manifest forms). For Ibn\nGabirol, this analogy helps highlight his view of the unfolding divine\nWisdom / Will giving way to a cosmos which is a complex blend of\nmatters and forms, with a principle of pure universal matter and pure\nuniversal form at the very root of all existence.\n\n\nHere, we may speak of a revised Neoplatonic cosmos in which\nprinciples of form, matter and Will (if we are to think of that as\nsomething separate from God's Essence) emerge\n\u201cbetween\u201d God and the principle of Intellect (the principle\nwhich follows directly upon God in standard chartings of the\nNeoplatonic cosmos):\n\n\nStandard Neoplatonic talk of the \u201cfirst reality\u201d after God\nGabirolean Neoplatonic talk of the \u201cfirst realities\u201d after God\n\n\n1. One/God\n1. God\n\n\n2. Intellect\n2\u20134. Pure Matter, Pure Form, Will/Wisdom/Word\n\n[leaving undecided\nthe relationship between all of these\nand the relationship between\nall of these and God]\n\n\n\n\n5. Intellect\n\n\n\n\nIn Ibn Gabirol's cosmology, Intellect is highlighted as the\n first created being, as the Divine Glory\n (Kavod),[25]\nand as the first\noccurrence of \u201cform in matter\u201d composition (see Fons\nVitae 5.10, p. 274, line 19; 5.11, p. 277, line 4; for the related\nidea that God creates esse in a composite way out of matter\nand form, cf. Fons Vitae 5.40, p. 329, line 4). At times, Ibn\nGabirol emphasizes that this matter is pre-existent (that it does not\nhave existence on its own without form), and at times, he can be taken,\non the contrary, as emphasizing the \u201cper se\nexistens\u201d nature of matter (as for example in his very\ndefinition of matter at Fons Vitae 1.10, p. 13, lines 15\u201317\nand 5.22, p. 298, lines 13\u20137). While the precise meaning of Ibn\nGabirol's idea is open for interpretation, Schlanger suggests\nthat matter per se exists for Ibn Gabirol only as an idea in\nthe mind of God, and not as an actual reality prior to Intellect (see\nSchlanger 1968, p. 294). In this vein, we may note Ibn Gairol's\nclaim that the existence (esse) of matter is in the wisdom of\nGod (Fons Vitae 5.10, p. 275).\n\n\nReflecting on Ibn Gabirol's idea of some kind of \u201cform\nand matter before Intellect\u201d (either in an actual or in some\nconceptual sense), it is worth considering to what extent this suggests\n(as the above two discrete charts seem to suggest) a genuine departure\nfrom Plotinian Neoplatonism. On the face of it, Plotinus does not\nemphasize a principle of matter and form prior to Intellect. As such,\nwe may say that Ibn Gabirol's emphasis introduces a Ps.\nEmpedoclean change (either an actual ontological change or a\nconceptual \u201cshift in focus\u201d) into the standard Plotinian\npicture. That said, Plotinus certainly is sensitive to the duality of\nthe unity of Intellect (as compared with the unity of the One), and\neven occasionally overtly emphasizes the notion of Intellect's\ncomposition out of \u201cintelligible matter\u201d (See\nEnneads 2.4.1\u20135, 5.4.2 and 5.5.4; on the conceptual resonance\nof \u201cintelligible matter\u201d in Plotinus and Ibn Gabirol, see\nDillon 1992). While these sections of the Enneads in which\nPlotinus overtly emphasizes this theme are not part of the Arabic\nPlotinus materials which we would presume Ibn Gabirol to have had\naccess, it is worth noting that Ibn Gabirol's emphasis on\n\u201cform and matter prior to intellect\u201d does not necessarily\nrepresent any conceptual departure from Plotinus (or, we might add,\nfrom Platonic and Pythagorean sensitivities to the principle of an\nindefinite dyad at the core of reality). Clearly Plotinus is sensitive\nto the \u201cduality\u201d of any grade of reality outside of the\nOne: while Intellect is for Plotinus a unity, it is clearly a\n\u201cdual\u201d (or even plural) sort of unity as compared with the\nutter unity of the One. In this sense, Plotinus is deeply sensitive to\nthe \u201cduality\u201d outside of God (and, as such, the duality of\nIntellect), even in passages where he is not overtly referencing the\ncomposition of Intellect/Being out of intelligible matter (which is to\nsay, even in passages where he is not emphasizing the dual nature of\nIntellect). In this sense, it is arguably conceptually appropriate to\nalign even Ibn Gabirol's most emphatic sense of the dual\n\u201cmatter-with-form\u201d composition of Intellect (or, relatedly,\nhis emphasis on a grade of matter \u201cprior to\u201d Intellect)\nwith even Plotinus' staunchest insistence on the unity of\nIntellect (as for Plotinus, the unity of Intellect, as compared with\nthe unity of the One, is dual by nature).\n",
