    "main_text": "Feminist Revisions of the History of Philosophy || Early Modern Women Philosophers: A Case Study\n2.1 Early Modern Women Philosophers: A Case Study\n\n\nFrom about the mid-1990s, there has been a concerted effort by\nscholars both to rehabilitate the works of early modern women\nphilosophers and to integrate at least some of these women into the\nphilosophical canon. These efforts illustrate how a range of different\nfeminist approaches to the history of philosophy can be integrated\ntogether.\n\n\nWhile many contemporary philosophers have little knowledge of the\nwomen philosophers of the early modern period, there are in fact good\nhistorical records of these women and their works. This fact has made\nthe doxographic task of retrieving these women thinkers a relatively\nstraightforward one, even if labor intensive. O'Neill (1998) catalogs a\nlong list of these women, and her doxographical work has provided a\nstarting point for both expanding the list and interpreting the\nphilosophical works of these women.\n\n\nIt is worth considering the context in which these women were\nwriting and what it suggests about their feminist methodology in the\nhistory of philosophy. Though anachronistic, it seems appropriate to\ncharacterize at least some of these women, along with some of the their\nmale contemporaries, as engaged in a feminist project. Many of these\nthinkers were self-consciously countering a recognized misogyny in\nphilosophy but, insofar as they deployed philosophical methods, they\nwould seem to reject the view that the problem was intrinsic to the\ndiscipline of philosophy itself. While the so-called querelle des\nfemmes had been going on for centuries, the seventeenth century\nmarked a turning point in the debate over the status of women as better\nor worse than men in virtue of their form or soul. (See Kelly 1988.)\nBoth women and men thinkers of the period advanced egalitarian\narguments. So, for instance, Marie De Gournay, in her \u201cOn the Equality\nof Men and Women,\u201d(1622) deployed a skeptical method to argue for the\nequality of men and women (De Gournay 2002); Anna Maria van Schurman\ndeployed syllogistic argumentation to argue for women's education both\nby demonstration and as evidence in her Dissertatio Logica\n(1638) (van Schurman 1998); in her Serious Proposal to the Ladies\nfor the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest (1694)\nMary Astell applied Descartes's sex-neutral account of the mind\n(insofar as mind is really distinct from body, rationality is not tied\nto sex) to argue for women's education (Astell 2002); Fran\u00e7ois\nPoulain de la Barre in On the Equality of the Two Sexes (1673)\nalso drew on Cartesian principles to argue for the social equality of\nmen and women (Poulain de la Barre 2002) . (Clarke 2013 collects de\nGournay, van Schurman and Poulain de la Barre together.) While the\nmethods deployed by these thinkers are different, they all appropriate\nphilosophical methods \u2013 skepticism, basic rules of inference, a new\nmetaphysics \u2013 different from what was then the dominant Aristotelian\nparadigm to counter misogynist claims.\n\n\nContemporary scholars concerned to reintegrate these women into the\nphilosophical canon have tended to adopt a strategy that does not\nassume that standard philosophical concepts or the canon itself are\ngender biased. Rather scholars aim (1) to make long out-of-print texts\naccessible again; (2) to develop interpretations of these texts that\n(a) bring out their philosophical content and (b) demonstrate the\ninvolvement of these women in the philosophical debates of the period.\nThe bibliographical appendix to this entry can direct readers to some\nrecent editions of writings by early modern women. The remainder of\nthis section sketches out one way in which scholars have pursued the\nsecond aim, and suggests some others.\n\n\nOne of the central themes of early modern philosophy is the\nreconceptualization of causation. Scholastic philosophy largely\nunderstood causation on an Aristotelian model, on which all change was\nto be explained by a constellation of four causes: final, formal,\nmaterial and efficient causes. Early modern thinking about causation\nbegan with a rejection of final and formal causes. Determining final\ncauses involved a speculation that outstripped human understanding,\nwhile formal causes were dismissed as occult qualities, simple\nassertions that things worked without an intelligible explanation of\nhow they did so. Several canonical figures in early modern philosophy\n\u2013 Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Hume and Kant \u2013 are often situated with\nrespect to one another through their views on causation. In recent\nyears, Malebranche, with his account of occasionalist causation, (a\nview on which neither bodies nor minds have causal power in themselves,\nand God is the only efficient cause), has been worked into the story.\nWhat Malebranche highlights is that understanding the nature of\ncausation was a live philosophical problem: while there was agreement\nabout dismissing final and formal causation, there was much\ndisagreement about what should replace it, and in particular about the\nnature of efficient causation. Some early modern women thinkers were\nvery much involved in this debate, and they are just as easily\nincorporated into the philosophical story as Malebranche. For instance,\nPrincess Elisabeth of Bohemia, in her 1643 correspondence with him,\nquestions Descartes about the nature of causation between mind and\nbody. She can be read as insisting that an adequate account of\ncausation must be applicable in all causal contexts. Margaret\nCavendish, in her Observations on the Experimental Philosophy,\ndevelops a vitalist account of causation wherein motion is not\ntransferred from one body to another, but rather one body comes to be\nin motion through a self-patterning in harmony with another body around\nit. (The SEP entry on Margaret Cavendish provides a more detailed\nsummary of Cavendish's account of causation, along with guidance for\nfurther reading.) While Cavendish's account of causation did not carry\nthe day, vitalism of one form or another was a dominant strand of\nthought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is worth noting\nthat vitalism is also a position within contemporary philosophy of\nbiology.\n\n\nA similar strategy for incorporating women into the philosophical\ncanon can be used with respect to such central topics as the Principle\nof Sufficient Reason (Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet), free will (Cavendish,\nDamaris Masham, du Ch\u00e2telet), and cosmology (Cavendish, Anne\nConway, Masham, Mary Astell, du Ch\u00e2telet; see Lascano\n(forthcoming)). The SEP entry on du Ch\u00e2telet contains a helpful\ndiscussion on her position on the Principle of Sufficient Reason, as\nwell as an array of secondary sources. The SEP entries on Cavendish,\nMasham and du Ch\u00e2telet provide some detail as to their positions\nregarding free will.\n\n\nHowever, one can also move to incorporate women into our\nphilosophical history by rethinking the questions through which that\nhistory is structured. How the questions are framed influences who is\ntaken to have interesting answers on offer. Within the early modern\nperiod, questions in epistemology are often about the nature of reason\nand rationality, and the limits of the human understanding. While women\nof the period sometimes address these questions theoretically, more\noften they are concerned with implications of such answers for training\nthe human mind. That is, they are concerned with matters of education,\nand they directly relate positions on education to positions on the\nnature of human understanding and rationality. Already mentioned are\nthe works of Anna Maria van Schurman and Mary Astell, but others\nincluding Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry and Gabrielle Suchon also wrote\non education. While education is not today typically taken to be\ncentral to philosophy, a little reflection on the history of philosophy\ncan destabilize this contemporary outlook. Descartes's Discourse on\nMethod for Rightly Conducting Reason (1637) is arguably a work\nabout education; John Locke wrote Some Thoughts Concerning\nEducation (1693) and On the Conduct of the Understanding\n(1706); and Rousseau's Emile (1762) also concerns education.\nEqually, education is a central concern of philosophers predating the\nearly modern period (consider Plato in Republic) and after it\n(consider John Dewey). Reconsidering education as a central question of\nphilosophy can facilitate seeing women thinkers as contributing\ncentrally to philosophical projects.\n",
