    "main_text": "The Problems of Metaphysics: the \u201cOld\u201d Metaphysics || Substance\n2.3 Substance\n\nSome things (if they exist at all) are present only \u201cin\u201d\nother things: a smile, a haircut (product, not process), a hole\n\u2026. Such things may be opposed to things that exist \u201cin\ntheir own right\u201d. Metaphysicians call the things that exist in\ntheir own right \u2018substances\u2019. Aristotle called them\n\u2018protai ousiai\u2019 or \u201cprimary beings\u201d.\nThey make up the most important of his ontological categories. Several\nfeatures define protai ousiai: they are subjects of\npredication that cannot themselves be predicated of things (they are\nnot universals); things exist \u201cin\u201d them, but they do not\nexist \u201cin\u201d things (they are not accidents like\nSocrates\u2019 wisdom or his ironic smile); they have determinate\nidentities (essences). This last feature could be put this way in\ncontemporary terms: if the prote ousia x exists at a\ncertain time and the prote ousia y exists at some\nother time, it makes sense to ask whether x and y\nare the same, are numerically identical (and the question must have a\ndeterminate answer); and the question whether a given prote\nousia would exist in some set of counterfactual circumstances\nmust likewise have an answer (at least if the circumstances are\nsufficiently determinate\u2014if, for example, they constitute a\npossible world. More on this in the next section). It is difficult to\nsuppose that smiles or holes have this sort of determinate identity.\nTo ask whether the smile Socrates smiled today is the smile he smiled\nyesterday (or is the smile he would have smiled if Crito had asked one\nof his charmingly na\u00efve questions) can only be a question about\ndescriptive identity.\n\nAristotle uses \u2018(prote) ousia\u2019 not only\nas a count-noun but as a mass term. (He generally writes\n\u2018ousia\u2019 without qualification when he believes\nthat the context will make it clear that he means \u2018prote\nousia\u2019.) For example, he not only asks questions like\n\u201cIs Socrates a (prote) ousia?\u201d and\n\u201cWhat is a (prote) ousia\u201d?, but\nquestions like \u201cWhat is the (prote) ousia of\nSocrates?\u201d and \u201cWhat is (prote)\nousia?\u201d (Which question he is asking sometimes has to\nbe inferred from the context, since there is no indefinite article in\nGreek.) In the count-noun sense of the term, Aristotle identifies at\nleast some (protai) ousiai with ta\nhupokeimena or \u201cunderlying things\u201d. Socrates, for\nexample, is a hupokeimenon in that he \u201clies\nunder\u201d the in rebus universals under which he falls and\nthe accidents that inhere in him. \u2018To\nhupokeimenon\u2019 has an approximate Latin equivalent in\n\u2018substantia\u2019, \u201cthat which stands\nunder\u201d. (Apparently, \u201cto stand under\u201d and \u201cto\nlie under\u201d are equally good metaphorical descriptions of the\nrelations a thing bears to its qualities and accidents.) Owing both to\nthe close association of (protai) ousiai and\nhupokeimena in Aristotle\u2019s philosophy and to the\nabsence of a suitable Latin equivalent of \u2018ousia\u2019\n\u2018substantia\u2019 became the customary Latin\ntranslation of the count-noun \u2018(prote)\nousia\u2019.\n\nThe question whether there in fact are substances continues to be one\nof the central questions of metaphysics. Several closely related\nquestions are: How, precisely, should the concept of substance be\nunderstood?; Which of the items (if any of them) among those we\nencounter in everyday life are substances?; If there are substances at\nall, how many of them are there?\u2014is there only one as Spinoza\ncontended, or are there many as most of the rationalists supposed?;\nWhat kinds of substances are there?\u2014are there immaterial\nsubstances, eternal substances, necessarily existent substances?\n\nIt must be emphasized that there is no universally accepted and\nprecise definition of \u2018substance\u2019. Depending on how one\nunderstood the word (or the concept) one might say either that Hume\ndenied that there were any substances or that he held that the only\nsubstances (or the only substances of which we have any knowledge)\nwere impressions and ideas. It would seem, however, that most\nphilosophers who are willing to use the word \u2018substance\u2019\nat all would deny that any of the following (if they exist) are\nsubstances:\n\nUniversals and other abstract objects. (It should be noted that\nAristotle criticized Plato for supposing that the protai\nousiai were ante res universals.)\nEvents, processes, or changes. (But some metaphysicians contend\nthat substance/event is a false dichotomy.)\nStuffs, such as flesh or iron or butter. (Unfortunately for\nbeginning students of metaphysics, the usual meaning of\n\u2018substance\u2019 outside philosophy is stuff. Aristotle\ncriticized \u201cthe natural philosophers\u201d for supposing that\nthe prote ousia could be a stuff\u2014water or air or fire\nor matter.)\n\n\nThe nature of being, the problem of universals, and the nature of\nsubstance have been recognized as topics that belong to\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d by almost everyone who has used the word. We\nnow turn to topics that belong to metaphysics only in the\npost-Medieval sense.\n",
