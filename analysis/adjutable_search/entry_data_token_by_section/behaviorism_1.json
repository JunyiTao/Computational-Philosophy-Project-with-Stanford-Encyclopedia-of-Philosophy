    "main_text": "Three Types of Behaviorism\n2. Three Types of Behaviorism\n\nMethodological behaviorism is a normative theory about the scientific\nconduct of psychology. It claims that psychology should concern itself\nwith the behavior of organisms (human and nonhuman animals).\nPsychology should not concern itself with mental states or events or\nwith constructing internal information processing accounts of\nbehavior. According to methodological behaviorism, reference to mental\nstates, such as an animal\u2019s beliefs or desires, adds nothing to\nwhat psychology can and should understand about the sources of\nbehavior. Mental states are private entities which, given the\nnecessary publicity of science, do not form proper objects of\nempirical study. Methodological behaviorism is a dominant theme in the\nwritings of John Watson (1878\u20131958).\n\nPsychological behaviorism is a research program within psychology. It\npurports to explain human and animal behavior in terms of external\nphysical stimuli, responses, learning histories, and (for certain\ntypes of behavior) reinforcements. Psychological behaviorism is\npresent in the work of Ivan Pavlov (1849\u20131936), Edward Thorndike\n(1874\u20131949), as well as Watson. Its fullest and most influential\nexpression is B. F. Skinner\u2019s work on schedules of\nreinforcement.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a hungry rat in an experimental chamber. If a\nparticular movement, such as pressing a lever when a light is on, is\nfollowed by the presentation of food, then the likelihood of the\nrat\u2019s pressing the lever when hungry, again, and the light is\non, is increased. Such presentations are reinforcements, such lights\nare (discriminative) stimuli, such lever pressings are responses, and\nsuch trials or associations are learning histories.\n\nAnalytical or logical behaviorism is a theory within philosophy about\nthe meaning or semantics of mental terms or concepts. It says that the\nvery idea of a mental state or condition is the idea of a behavioral\ndisposition or family of behavioral tendencies, evident in how a\nperson behaves in one situation rather than another. When we attribute\na belief, for example, to someone, we are not saying that he or she is\nin a particular internal state or condition. Instead, we are\ncharacterizing the person in terms of what he or she might do in\nparticular situations or environmental interactions. Analytical\nbehaviorism may be found in the work of Gilbert Ryle (1900\u201376)\nand the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889\u201351) (if perhaps\nnot without controversy in interpretation, in Wittgenstein\u2019s\ncase). More recently, the philosopher-psychologist U. T. Place\n(1924\u20132000) advocated a brand of analytical behaviorism restricted to\nintentional or representational states of mind, such as beliefs, which\nPlace took to constitute a type, although not the only type, of\nmentality (see Graham and Valentine 2004). Arguably, a version of\nanalytical or logical behaviorism may also be found in the work of\nDaniel Dennett on the ascription of states of consciousness via a\nmethod he calls \u2018heterophenomenology\u2019 (Dennett 2005, pp.\n25\u201356).
