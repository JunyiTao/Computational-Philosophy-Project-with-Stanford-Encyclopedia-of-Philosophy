    "main_text": "Moral Theories: the Good, the Right, the Virtuous || Virtue Theories\n4.3 Virtue Theories\n\nVirtue theories take approval and disapproval, praise and blame, as\nthe fundamental bases for morality. Customary morality relies heavily\non acts of praise and blame to perpetuate itself. Critical reflection\nseeks a standard by which people\u2019s approvals and disapprovals\ncan be appraised. Dewey argued that the British utilitarians carried\nthis inquiry most deeply with their ideal observer theory of morality,\nwhich identified the standard with that by which an informed impartial\nand benevolent observer appraises conduct \u2014 namely, its tendency\nto promote everyone\u2019s welfare. But, given that the content of\npeople\u2019s welfare is not fixed, but open to imaginative\nexpansion, this standard can no more be applied in algorithmic fashion\nthan moral principles can be. Like moral principles, the utilitarian\nstandard of approval sets up a general standpoint for the appraisal of\nconduct, and revision of ends in light of such appraisal, rather than\na fixed criterion that can be mechanically applied (E\n237\u201347).\n\nDewey argued that praise and blame function to make individuals\nconscious of and responsive to the wider consequences of their actions\nfor others. This forward-looking view of praise and blame enabled\nDewey to avoid the problem of free will in its connection with\nresponsibility. Praise and blame are tools for enabling\npeople to assume responsibility for their conduct \u2014 to enable\nthem to regulate their conduct in view of their consequences for\nothers. Hence, the presupposition of praise and blame is not that the\nindividual held to account could have done otherwise at the time of\nacting. It is rather that praise and blame can induce people to be\nmore conscientious \u2014 to govern their conduct in light of the\nresponsibilities ascribed to them, to act out of a sense of their own\nresponsibility, and thereby to take notice and mastery of the motives\nby which they act \u2014 in the future. This fact is most evident in\nour practices of praising and blaming children. Young children are not\nautonomous agents and lack free will in any sense relevant to the\ndebates about responsibility. They are not responsible for their\nconduct. Yet, in praising and blaming them, we hold them responsible\nfor their conduct, as the necessary means by which they can become\nresponsible for their conduct in the future. This is not a special or\nanomalous use of praise or blame; it is its paradigmatic use (HNC\n119\u201322; LE 86\u201396).\n",
