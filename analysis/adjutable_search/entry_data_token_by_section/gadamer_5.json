    "main_text": "Philosophical Hermeneutics || The Happening of Tradition\n3.2 The Happening of Tradition\n\nInasmuch as understanding always occurs against the background of our\nprior involvement, so it always occurs on the basis of our\nhistory. Understanding, for Gadamer, is thus always an\n\u2018effect\u2019 of history, while hermeneutical\n\u2018consciousness\u2019 is itself that mode of being that is\nconscious of its own historical \u2018being effected\u2019\u2014it\nis \u2018historically-effected consciousness\u2019\n(wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewu\u00dftsein). Awareness of the\nhistorically effected character of understanding is, according to\nGadamer, identical with an awareness of the hermeneutical situation\nand he also refers to that situation by means of the phenomenological\nconcept of \u2018horizon\u2019\n(Horizont)\u2014understanding and interpretation thus always\noccurs from within a particular \u2018horizon\u2019 that is\ndetermined by our historically-determined situatedness. Understanding\nis not, however, imprisoned within the horizon of its\nsituation\u2014indeed, the horizon of understanding is neither static\nnor unchanging (it is, after all, always subject to the effects of\nhistory). Just as our prejudices are themselves brought into question\nin the process of understanding, so, in the encounter with another, is\nthe horizon of our own understanding susceptible to change.\n\nGadamer views understanding as a matter of negotiation between oneself\nand one\u2019s partner in the hermeneutical dialogue such that the\nprocess of understanding can be seen as a matter of coming to an\n\u2018agreement\u2019 about the matter at issue. Coming to such an\nagreement means establishing a common framework or\n\u2018horizon\u2019 and Gadamer thus takes understanding to be a\nprocess of the \u2018fusion of horizons\u2019\n(Horizontverschmelzung). In phenomenology, the\n\u2018horizon\u2019 is, in general terms, that larger context of\nmeaning in which any particular meaningful presentation is situated.\nInasmuch as understanding is taken to involve a \u2018fusion of\nhorizons\u2019, then so it always involves the formation of a new\ncontext of meaning that enables integration of what is otherwise\nunfamiliar, strange or anomalous. In this respect, all understanding\ninvolves a process of mediation and dialogue between what is familiar\nand what is alien in which neither remains unaffected. This process of\nhorizontal engagement is an ongoing one that never achieves any final\ncompletion or complete elucidation\u2014moreover, inasmuch as our own\nhistory and tradition is itself constitutive of our own hermeneutic\nsituation as well as being itself constantly taken up in the process\nof understanding, so our historical and hermeneutic situation can\nnever be made completely transparent to us. As a consequence, Gadamer\nexplicitly takes issue with the Hegelian \u2018philosophy of\nreflection\u2019 that aims at just such completion and\ntransparency.\n\nIn contrast with the traditional hermeneutic account, Gadamer thus\nadvances a view of understanding that rejects the idea of\nunderstanding as achieved through gaining access to some inner realm\nof subjective meaning. Moreover, since understanding is an ongoing\nprocess, rather than something that is ever completed, so he also\nrejects the idea that there is any final determinacy to understanding.\nIt is on this basis that Gadamer argues against there being any method\nor technique for achieving understanding or arriving at truth. The\nsearch for a methodology for the Geisteswissenschaften that\nwould place them on a sound footing alongside the \u2018sciences of\nnature\u2019 (the Naturwissenschaften)\u2014a search that\nhad characterized much previous hermeneutical inquiry\u2014is thus\nshown to be fundamentally misguided. Not only is there no methodology\nthat describes the means by which to arrive at an understanding of the\nhuman or the historical, but neither is there any such methodology\nthat is adequate to the understanding of the non-human or the natural.\nGadamer\u2019s conception of understanding as not reducible to method\nor technique, along with his insistence of understanding as an ongoing\nprocess that has no final completion, not only invites comparison with\nideas to be found in the work of the later Wittgenstein, but can also\nbe seen as paralleling developments in post-Kuhnian philosophy of\nscience.\n",
