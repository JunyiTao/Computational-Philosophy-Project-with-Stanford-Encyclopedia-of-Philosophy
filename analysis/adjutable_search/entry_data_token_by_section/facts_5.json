    "main_text": "Formal Theories of Facts\n2. Formal Theories of Facts\n\nFormal studies of facts are scarce. And they are also heterogeneous,\nboth in form and in content. In form insofar as they are formulated in\nlanguages of various kinds, which vary greatly in expressive power.\nAnd in content, not only because of the variety of views on given\nissues, but also because the kind of issues dealt with varies greatly.\nThis makes it difficult to present these theories within a uniform\nframework. We are going to choose a specific framework, present,\nwithin that framework, (some of) the options a fact-theorist may wish\nto adopt, study their relationships, and give references in due course\nto indicate where in the resulting space of possible theories various\naccounts, formal and non-formal, are to be located. Our framework is\nsignificantly distinct from many of those which are used in the\nliterature. So it should be kept in mind that in attributing this or\nthat view to an author, what we will say is often not to be understood\nliterally: when it is not, what we really attribute to the\nauthor is something which, translated into our framework, is what we\nliterally attribute to her.\n\nThere are two main uses of the predicate \u2018is a fact\u2019. On\none of them, the predicate is rigid (necessarily, if something is a\nfact, then it cannot fail to be a fact). On that use, and given the\nassumption that there are contingent facts, it is possible that\nsomething be a fact without existing (obtaining). On the second use,\nnothing can be a fact unless it exists, and so on the assumption that\nthere are contingent facts, the predicate is non-rigid. Some call\nfacts in the first sense states of affairs or\nsituations, reserving the word \u2018fact\u2019 to mean\nwhat \u2018obtaining state of affairs\u2019 or \u2018actual\nsituation\u2019 mean. Throughout this section we shall use\n\u2018fact\u2019 in the first sense.\n\nThe issues we are going to deal with fall under the following five\nheadings: Facts and Worlds, Boolean Operations on Facts, Independency,\nFacts and Propositions, The Inner Structure of Facts. The presentation\nwill be cumulative in character: in each section we will come back to\ntopics dealt with in previous ones (if any), sometimes in order to\ncompare the current options available to a fact-theorist to the old\nones.\n",
