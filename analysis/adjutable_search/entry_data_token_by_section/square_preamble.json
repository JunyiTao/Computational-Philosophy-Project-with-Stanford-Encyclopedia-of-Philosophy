    "main_text": "\n\n\nThis entry traces the historical development of the Square of\nOpposition, a collection of logical relationships traditionally\nembodied in a square diagram. This body of doctrine provided a\nfoundation for work in logic for over two millennia. For most of this\nhistory, logicians assumed that negative particular propositions\n(\u201cSome S is not P\u201d) are vacuously true\nif their subjects are empty. This validates the logical laws embodied\nin the diagram, and preserves the doctrine against modern\ncriticisms. Certain additional principles\n(\u201ccontraposition\u201d and \u201cobversion\u201d) were\nsometimes adopted along with the Square, and they genuinely yielded\ninconsistency. By the nineteenth century an inconsistent set of\ndoctrines was widely adopted. Strawson\u2019s 1952 attempt to rehabilitate\nthe Square does not apply to the traditional doctrine; it does salvage\nthe nineteenth century version but at the cost of yielding inferences\nthat lead from truth to falsity when strung together.\n\n",
