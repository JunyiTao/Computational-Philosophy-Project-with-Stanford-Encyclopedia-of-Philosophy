    "main_text": "\n\nAn article in The Economist (21 February 2008, \u201cMoral\nthinking\u201d), sporting the provocative subtitle \u201cBiology\nInvades a Field Philosophers Thought was Safely Theirs\u201d, begins\nwith the following rumination:\n\nWhence morality? That is a question which has troubled philosophers\nsince their subject was invented. Two and a half millennia of debate\nhave, however, failed to produce a satisfactory answer. So now it is\ntime for someone else to have a \n go.[1]\n\n\nAnd the article closes with the line \u201cPerhaps [biologists] can\neventually do what philosophers have never managed, and explain moral\nbehavior in an intellectually satisfying way.\u201d These passages\nepitomize a growing theme in the popular and scientific media, echoing\nclaims made forty years ago with the emergence of\nsociobiology, when E.O. Wilson suggested that \u201cthe time\nhas come for ethics to be removed temporarily from the hands of the\nphilosophers and biologicized\u201d (Wilson 1975, 562). For their\npart, moral philosophers will hasten to point out that they are not\nprimarily in the business of \u201cexplaining moral behavior\u201d\nin the sense of causally explaining the origins of our capacity for\nmoral judgment or of various associated emotional and behavioral\ndispositions. If a moral philosopher asks \u201cwhence\nmorality,\u201d she is more likely to be concerned with the\njustification of moral principles or the source and nature of\nobligation. Still, there are important potential connections between\nthe scientific explanatory issues and philosophical ones, opening the\nway for profitable interdisciplinary inquiry.\n\nSection 1 provides an overview of the issues and a sketch of the\nconnections between them, highlighting important distinctions we will\nneed throughout. Sections 2, 3 and 4 then go on to explore critically\nthe three main branches of inquiry at the intersection of morality and\nevolutionary biology: Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics, Prescriptive\nEvolutionary Ethics, and Evolutionary Metaethics.\n",
