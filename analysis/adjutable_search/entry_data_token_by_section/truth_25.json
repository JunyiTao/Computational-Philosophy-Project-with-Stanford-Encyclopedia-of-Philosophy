    "main_text": "Truth and language || Truth and truth conditions\n6.2 Truth and truth conditions\n\nThere is a related, but somewhat different point, which is important\nto understanding the theories we have canvassed.\n\nThe neo-classical theories of truth start with truth-bearers which are\nalready understood to be meaningful, and explain how they get their\ntruth values. But along the way, they often do something more. Take\nthe neo-classical correspondence theory, for instance. This theory, in\neffect, starts with a view of how propositions are meaningful. They\nare so in virtue of having constituents in the world, which are\nbrought together in the right way. There are many complications about\nthe nature of meaning, but at a minimum, this tells us what the truth\nconditions associated with a proposition are. The theory then explains\nhow such truth conditions can lead to the truth value true,\nby the right fact existing.\n\nMany theories of truth are like the neo-classical correspondence\ntheory in being as much theories of how truth-bearers are meaningful\nas of how their truth values are fixed. Again, abstracting from some\ncomplications about meaning, this makes them theories both of truth\nconditions and truth values. The Tarskian theory of\ntruth can be construed this way too. This can be seen both in the way\nthe Tarski biconditionals are understood, and how a recursive theory\nof truth is understood. As we explained Convention T in section 2.2,\nthe primary role of a Tarski biconditional of the form\n\\(\\ulcorner \\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\)\nis true if and only if \\(\\phi \\urcorner\\) is to fix whether\n\\(\\phi\\) is in the extension of \u2018is true\u2019 or not. But it can\nalso be seen as stating the truth conditions of \\(\\phi\\). Both\nrely on the fact that the unquoted occurrence of \\(\\phi\\) is an\noccurrence of an interpreted sentence, which has a truth value, but\nalso provides its truth conditions upon occasions of use.\n\nLikewise, the base clauses of the recursive definition of truth, those\nfor reference and satisfaction, are taken to state the relevant\nsemantic properties of constituents of an interpreted sentence. In\ndiscussing Tarski\u2019s theory of truth in section 2, we focused on\nhow these determine the truth value of a sentence. But they also show\nus the truth conditions of a sentence are determined by these semantic\nproperties. For instance, for a simple sentence like \u2018Snow is\nwhite\u2019, the theory tells us that the sentence is true if the\nreferent of \u2018Snow\u2019 satisfies \u2018white\u2019. This can\nbe understood as telling us that the truth conditions of\n\u2018Snow is white\u2019 are those conditions in which the referent\nof \u2018Snow\u2019 satisfies the predicate \u2018is\nwhite\u2019.\n\nAs we saw in sections 3 and 4, the Tarskian apparatus is often seen as\nneeding some kind of supplementation to provide a full theory of\ntruth. A full theory of truth conditions will likewise rest on how the\nTarskian apparatus is put to use. In particular, just what kinds of\nconditions those in which the referent of \u2018snow\u2019 satisfies\nthe predicate \u2018is white\u2019 are will depend on whether we opt\nfor realist or anti-realist theories. The realist option will simply\nlook for the conditions under which the stuff snow bears the property\nof whiteness; the anti-realist option will look to the conditions\nunder which it can be verified, or asserted with warrant, that snow is\nwhite.\n\nThere is a broad family of theories of truth which are theories of\ntruth conditions as well as truth values. This family includes the\ncorrespondence theory in all its forms \u2013 classical and modern.\nYet this family is much wider than the correspondence theory, and\nwider than realist theories of truth more generally. Indeed, virtually\nall the theories of truth that make contributions to the\nrealism/anti-realism debate are theories of truth conditions. In a\nslogan, for many approaches to truth, a theory of truth is a theory of\ntruth conditions.\n",
