The Stoics are determinists about causation, who\nregard the present as fully determined by past events, but who\nnonetheless want to preserve scope for moral responsibility by\ndefending a version of compatibilism.\n\nThe Stoic analysis of causation is peculiar and might sound odd to the\nmodern ear. They say that every cause is a body which becomes the\ncause to a body of something incorporeal. For instance, the scalpel, a\nbody, becomes the cause to the flesh, a body, of the incorporeal\npredicate \u201cbeing cut\u201d. (Sextus, 55B; cf. Stobaeus, 55A).\nIn addition, the Stoics develop a taxonomy of causes, the sources on\nwhich are complex and not always clear, but which they brought to bear\nin their defense of compatibilism.\n\nWhat the Stoics call fate, which they identify with the working out of\nthe \u2013 rational and predictable \u2013 will of Zeus, is \u201ca\ncertain natural everlasting ordering of the whole: one set of things\nfollows on and succeeds another, and the interconnexion in\ninviolable\u201d (Aulus Gellius, 55K). In other words, every event\nthat occurs in the world is the result of a cause or chain of causes,\nso that everything that happens is metaphysically determined by\npreceding causes in the chain (but not logically necessary; cf. de\nHarven 2016). This sequence of causes is inescapable.\n\nThe inescapability of this sequence of causes leads to concerns about\naction and moral responsibility. The first worry, which takes the form\nof the so-called \u201clazy argument\u201d (Cicero, 55S) is that, if\nall my actions and their consequences are predetermined, there is no\npoint in acting at all: why call the doctor when ill, if it is\ndetermined that the doctor will come? The second worry is that if my\nactions come about by prior causes, they are not in my power and I am\ntherefore not truly responsible for them.\n\nIn response to the former challenge, Chrysippus claimed that not all\nevents are independent of one another. Rather, some are co-fated: part\nof one and the same causal chain in such a way that they cannot be\ndissociated. The call to the doctor and the doctor\u2019s coming are\nso joined, as is the patient\u2019s healing. The doctor will not come\nif she is not called, and the patient will not heal if the doctor does\nnot come. Calling the doctor is thus not superfluous or pointless. The\nconsequences of our actions may be predetermined, but only insofar as\nthey are caused by our actions. Our actions are thus not pointless: we\nmust act in order to ensure their consequences come about (see further\ncritical discussion in Brennan 2005, ch. 16).\n\nIn response to the concern about moral responsibility, Chrysippus\nbegins by distinguishing different types of causes. Although nothing\nhappens without an antecedent cause, he claims, not all antecedent\ncauses are sufficient for bringing about their effect (Plutarch, 55R):\nsome antecedent causes \u2013 those which are called \u201cauxiliary\nand proximate\u201d (Cicero, 62C) \u2013 function as merely\nnecessary conditions.\n\nChrysippus deploys this distinction among antecedent causes in the\ncourse of explaining how human actions are both causally determined\nand subject to moral evaluation. Though the details are difficult, the\ngeneral strategy is clear enough and illuminated by the famous\ncylinder and cone analogy:\n\n\n[Chrysippus] resorts to his cylinder and cone: these cannot begin to\nmove without a push; but once that has happened, he holds that it is\nthereafter through their own nature that the cylinder rolls and the\ncone spins. \u2018Hence\u2019, he says, \u2018just as the person\nwho pushed the cylinder gave it its beginning of motion but not its\ncapacity for rolling, likewise, although the impression encountered\nwill print and, as it were, emblazon its appearance on the mind,\nassent will be in our power.\u2019 (Cicero, 62C; see also Gellius,\n62D)\n\n\nConsider two differently shaped solids \u2013 a cylinder and a cone\n\u2013 both sitting atop the same steep slope. The two solids are\ngiven a push of equal strength and begin to tumble down the hill. But\nwhereas the cylinder rolls in a straight path, the cone spins and\nveers off to the side. Neither of these movements could have occurred\nwithout the push, Chrysippus argues, but the particular way each solid\nmoves \u2013 whether it rolls or spins \u2013 is caused by its own\nnature and \u201ccapacity for rolling\u201d. The push therefore\nfunctions as an \u201cauxiliary and proximate\u201d antecedent\ncause, which on its own is sufficient for causing the solid to move,\nbut not for causing it to roll rather than spin. Rather, it is the\nindividual nature of each solid that is so responsible. (Note that,\ngiven the push the solid receives, together with its own nature and\ncapacity for rolling, each solid could not do otherwise than move in\nthe way that it does.)\n\nNow consider two agents with different psychological profiles \u2013\nfor instance, one person who is a glutton for sweets and another who\nis not \u2013 both of whom are presented with a thick slice of carrot\ncake. That the glutton rushes towards the cake and eagerly gobbles it\nup, whereas the other agent does not (perhaps picking at it slowly\nover a few hours), maps onto the cylinder\u2019s rolling and the\ncone\u2019s spinning. Both agents receive the same external stimulus\nfor action and form \u201cimpressions\u201d (mental representations,\nphantasiai / visa) of the cake, but, like the push\nin the case of the solids, these are not sufficient to cause the\ndifferential behavioral response in the two agents. Rather, it is\ntheir individual psychological profiles and the activity of giving or\nwithholding mental \u201cassent\u201d to the impression that eating\nthe cake is fitting to do which cause them to gobble the cake or not\n(more on impression, assent, and action in\n 2.9\n below). One\u2019s psychological profile is causally efficacious for\naction, over and above the external stimulus. So among the antecedent\ncauses for human action \u2013 and by far the most decisive \u2013\nis the agent himself, his individual nature or psychological profile,\nwith the result that our actions are \u201cup to us\u201d or\n\u201cin our power\u201d in a way that is relevant for the notion of\nresponsibility.\n\nMuch more could be said on this analogy. Detailed scholarly work on\nthe question of freedom and determinism in Stoicism can be found in\nBobzien 1998.
