    "main_text": "Measuring heritability: From Galton to GWAS\n3. Measuring heritability: From Galton to GWAS\n\nFrancis Galton promoted a version of Darwin\u2019s account of\ninheritance that clearly identified an internal, material contribution\nto hereditary traits. He proposed the distinction between nature and\nnurture, arguing that traits due to nature were the products of\ninherited biological material. He also was the first to propose the\nstudy of human twins as a way of understanding the contribution of\nnature, as opposed to nurture, to human traits (Burbridge 2001; see\nalso Kronfeldner 2018). Galton\u2019s early work set the basis for a\nparadigm in behavior genetics: twin and family studies. In studies of\nplants and other organisms, genetic makeup and environment can be\nsystematically varied to assess the relative impact of genes and\nenvironment on phenotypic traits. Twin studies are human behavioral\ngeneticists\u2019 analogue to such experiments (See, e.g.,\nShaffner 2016). By tracking similarities and differences between\ngroups of genetically related individuals reared in similar\nenvironments, twin and family studies permit some scientific\ninvestigation into sources of variance attributable to genetics and\nenvironment. The predominant tool for practitioners in the field is\nthe statistical \u2018ACE model\u2019 (figure X)\n\n\n\n\nThe ACE model is a factor analytic model that partitions phenotypic\nvariance (represented with boxes) into three latent components\n(represented with circles). The first latent factor, \u2018A\u2019\nrepresents \u2018additive\u2019 genetic variance and captures\ngenetic similarities and dissimilarities between twin pairs, as\nmonozygotic (MZ) \u2018identical\u2019 twins share roughly 100% of\ntheir DNA while dizygotic (DZ) \u2018fraternal\u2019 twins share\nroughly 50% of their DNA, just like normal siblings. The component\n\u2018C\u2019 represents \u2018common\u2019 environment,\nsignifying environmental variance that is shared by twin pairs reared\ntogether. For example, because both MZ and DZ twin pairs live in the\nsame home, the correlation between their shared environment equals 1.\nFinally, \u2018E\u2019 represents \u2018unique\u2019 or\nnon-shared environmental variance, capturing environmental variables\nthat vary between twin pairs. In effect, it is the environmental\nvariation that is not shared by twins outside the home which ends up\ngetting couched as \u2018E\u2019, as is the case when twins\nattend different institutions or undergo different life events. \n\nThe ACE model is effectively a visual representation\u2014in the form\nof a path analysis\u2014of the underlying mathematics of heritability\nestimation, known as \u2018Falconer\u2019s formula\u2019 (Falconer\nand McKay 1998). The formula is derived from an observed population\nstatistic: the phenotypic correlation between pairs of MZ and DZ\ntwins. For any phenotype the MZ correlation or\n\u2018\\(r_{\\MZ}\\)\u2019 is typically higher than the DZ correlation\nor \u2018\\(r_{\\DZ}\\)\u2019. Perhaps unsurprisingly, genetically\nidentical twins are more similar than fraternal twins. The implication\nis that the greater the genetic similarity, the greater the phenotypic\nsimilarity. Thus, narrow-sense, quantitative genetic heritability is\nintuitively defined as the difference between MZ and DZ\ncorrelations: the greater the difference, the higher the heritability.\nOn the flip side, if there is minimal difference between MZ and DZ\ncorrelations, it would imply that genetics have little to do with\nvariance in the trait in question, and result in a low heritability\nestimate.\n\nFalconer\u2019s formula starts from the simple observation that MZ\ntwin pairs share two of the three components in common: 100% of their\ngenes and 100% of their common environment. Thus, MZ correlation are\ntreated as the sum of A and C: \n\n\\[ r_{\\MZ} = A + C\\]\n\n\nSimilarly, DZ twin pares share 100% of their common environment, but\nonly half their genetic relatedness. Thus, the DZ correlation is the\nsum of half additive genetic variance and common environment:\n\n\\[r_{\\DZ} = \\frac{A}{2} + C\\]\n\n\nWith these definitions in place, Falconer\u2019s formula permits\nheritability estimation by calculating the difference between MZ and\nDZ correlations: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_{\\MZ} - r _{\\DZ} & =  A - \\frac{A}{2} + C - C\\\\\nr_{\\MZ} - r _{\\DZ} & =  A - \\frac{A}{2}\\\\\n\\therefore A & = 2\\left (r_{\\MZ} - r_{\\DZ}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nWith narrow-sense heritability defined, one may deduce the formulas\nfor estimating shared (C): \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_{\\DZ} & = \\frac{A}{2} +C \\\\\nr_{\\DZ} &= \\frac{r_{\\MZ} -C}{2} + C\\\\\n2 r_{\\DZ} & = r_{\\MZ} - C + 2C\\\\\n2 r_{\\DZ} & = r_{\\MZ}  + C\\\\\n\\therefore C&= 2 r_{\\DZ} - r_{\\MZ}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nFinally, non-shared environment may be derived from the assumption\nthat genetic similarity, shared environment, and non-shared\nenvironment comprise the total variance in an observed trait:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nA + C + E & =1 \\\\\n[ 2(r_{\\MZ} - r_{\\DZ})] + [2(r_{\\MZ} - r_{\\DZ})] + E & = 1\\\\\nr_{\\MZ} + E & = 1\\\\\n\\therefore E & =  1- r_{\\MZ}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nConsider the following example. In a twin study, one conducts a study\nof height, revealing that \\(r_{\\MZ} = .95\\) and \\(r_{\\DZ} = .55.\\)\nWith this information, the basic techniques of quantitative genetics\nmay be used to partition said variance into sources attributable to\nshared genetics or environments. Starting with heritability:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nA & = 2(r_{\\MZ} - r_{\\DZ})\\\\\nA & = 2(.95-.55)\\\\\nA & = 2(.4) \\\\\nA & = .8 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nAlthough philosophically contentious (for reasons discussed elsewhere\nin this entry), the outcome above suggests that 80% of the variance in\nheight in the studied population of twins reared together is\nattributable to genetic differences. To estimate non-shared\nenvironment (C), recall the formula derived earlier:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nC & = 2r_{\\DZ} - r_{\\MZ}\\\\\nC & = 2(.55) - .95\\\\\nC  & = .15\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nFinally, total variance in height attributable to non-shared\nenvironment: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nE & = 1 - r_{\\MZ}\\\\\nE & = 1 - .95 \\\\\nE & = .05\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nIn this example, 80% of the variance in height is attributable to\nadditive genetics (A = .8), 15% to shared environment (C\n= .15), and 5% to non-shared environment (E = .05).\n\nResearch on heritability is currently undergoing a major transition.\nFor nearly a century, heritability has been estimated in the\n\u2018traditional\u2019 sense, through twin and family studies,\nwhich are silent with respect to the underlying biological units of\ngenetic transmission. Twin and family studies and the ACE model, that\nis, proceed from coarse-grained assumptions about genetic relatedness:\nMZ twin share roughly 100% of their genetic material, DZ just half. It\nwasn\u2019t until Watson and Crick\u2019s co-discovery of the double\nhelical model of DNA that geneticists could refine heritability\nestimation with attention to biological details. Too much has happened\nsince the discovery of DNA to detail here, such as linkage analysis\nand candidate gene studies, but a few key developments are integral to\nunderstanding the most recent approaches to estimating\nheritability.\n\nFirst, all modern approaches to heritability estimation are\nconstructed from empirical data on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms\n(SNPs). In effect, SNPs are the fundamental units of genetic\ndifferences that occur between individuals. While genetic sequences\nbetween humans are greater than 99% identical, SNPs are the points that\ndiffer. From a blood or saliva sample, \u2018SNP chips\u2019 allow\nresearchers to acquire a large set of SNPs for an individual. Early\nSNP chips tracked 500,000 variants across the genome; recent\ntechnology allows SNP detection in the excess of millions. With the\ndevelopment of fast and cheap SNP chips within the past ten years, one\nnow has the ability to assess large populations of minute DNA-based\ndifferences between individuals, which confers a new approach to\nestimating heritability. Through a large family of approaches, Genome\nWide Association Studies (GWAS) identify statistical associations\nbetween SNPs and thousands of phenotypes, from physical traits (e.g.,\nheight, weight, BMI, etc.) to behavioral and psychiatric traits (e.g.,\nIQ, schizophrenia, depression, etc.). Historically, GWAS are conducted\nas case-control studies: SNP profiles are collected from one\npopulation of individuals who share a trait (such as high ADHD or\nmacular degeneration) and are compared to SNP profiles of a control\npopulation lacking in the trait under investigation. If it turns out\nthat populations, on average, with the trait of interest also share\ngenetic similarities, then GWAS will flag the relevant SNPs as\nstatistically significant.\n\nGWAS identify SNPs that are statistically correlated with phenotypes\nof interest. After nearly a century of twin and family studies\nconsistently demonstrating relatively high heritability of traits,\nthere was some expectation that early GWAS would find a few genes of\nlarge effect. GWAS results in this respect have been disappointing.\nWhile twin studies indicate that roughly 50% of the total variance in\ncognitive ability is explained by genetic differences, individual SNPs\nassociated with cognitive ability typically explain less than .04%\ntotal variance.\n\nOne simple method of increasing the amount of phenotypic variance\naccounted for by GWAS (sometimes referred to as\n\u2018h2GWAS\u2019) is to sum the total\neffects of genome-wide significant SNP hits. The first efforts to do\nthis were met with disappointing results as well. Weedon et al. (2008)\nconducted a GWAS of height which identified 20 SNPs with a combined\neffect of 3%. These meager results inspired an impetus in the GWAS\ncommunity to conduct bigger and better studies that would be required\nto power the small effect sizes of individual SNPs. Bigger data meant\nmore SNPs, which meant more variance explained and, consequently,\nincreased h2GWAS. Even when summing the small\neffects of hundreds of genome-wide significant SNPs, variance\nexplained by GWAS results are still quite small. For example, the\ntraditional heritability of IQ is 50%, while the largest GWAS of IQ to\ndate explains less than 5% total variance (Plomin and von Stumm\n2018).\n\nIn an effort to increase the amount of phenotypic variance accounted\nfor by GWAS results, Yang et al. (2015) developed genome complex trait\nanalysis (GCTA), now referred to as \u2018SNP heritability\u2019 (or\nh2SNP). While traditional heritability is\nestimated from coarse-grain genetic similarity of related individuals,\nSNP heritability is estimated from fine-grain genetic similarity of\nunrelated individuals. SNP heritability now comprises a family of\nhighly sophisticated statistical techniques that seek to maximize\nproportions of phenotypic variance attributable to observed or imputed\nSNP variants. SNP heritability exhibits a few features worth\nattention. First, instead of limiting analysis to SNPs who meet the\nstrict p-value GWAS significance threshold, SNP heritability is\nderived by analyzing the complete set of SNPs for each participant\nsample\u2014even those that are not associated with the trait of\ninterest. To this end, SNP heritability is biologically non-obvious.\nSecond, SNP heritability assumes linear additivity of SNP effects.\nThird, SNP heritability represents the current limit on the total\nvariance that could be explained by SNPs, for any given phenotype. So,\nfor example, if a polygenic score were maximally predictive, it would\nbe equivalent to SNP heritability. Fourth, SNP heritability is\nconsistently lower than twin heritability, for any behavioral trait.\nThis gap between twin heritability and SNP heritability is sometimes\nreferred to as the missing heritability problem, which we discuss in\nSection 5.\n",
