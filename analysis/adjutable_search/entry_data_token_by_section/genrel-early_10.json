    "main_text": "Logical Empiricism || Lessons of Methodology?\n4.1 Lessons of Methodology?\n\nLogical empiricism\u2019s philosophy of science was conceived under\nthe guiding star of Einstein\u2019s two theories of relativity, as\nmay be seen from the early writings of its founders, for purposes\nhere, Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Hans Reichenbach. A small\nmonograph of Schlick, Space and Time in Contemporary Physics,\nappearing in 1917 initially in successive issues of the scientific\nweekly Die Naturwissenschaften, served as prototype. One of\nthe first of a host of philosophical examinations of the general\ntheory of relativity, it was distinguished both by the lucidity of its\nlargely non-technical physical exposition and by Einstein\u2019s\nenthusiastic praise of its philosophical appraisal, favoring\nconventionalism \u00e0 la Poincar\u00e9 over both\nneo-Kantianism and Machian positivism. The transformation of the\nconcept of space within the general theory of relativity was the\nsubject of Rudolf Carnap\u2019s dissertation at Jena in 1921.\nAppearing as a monograph in 1922, it also evinced a broadly\nconventionalist methodology combined with elements of Husserlian\ntranscendental phenomenology. Distinguishing clearly between\nintuitive, physical and purely formal conceptions of space, Carnap\nargued that, subject to the necessary constraints of certain a\npriori phenomenological conditions of the topology of intuitive\nspace, the purely formal and the physical aspects of theories of\nspace, can be adjusted to one another so as to preserve any\nconventionally chosen aspect. In turn, Hans Reichenbach was one of\nfive intrepid attendees of Einstein\u2019s first seminar on general\nrelativity given at Berlin University in the tumultuous winter of\n1918\u20131919; his detailed notebooks survive. The general theory of\nrelativity was the particular subject of Reichenbach\u2019s\nneo-Kantian first book (1920), which is dedicated to Albert Einstein,\nas well as of his next two books (1924, 1928), and of numerous papers\nin the 1920s.\n\nBut Einstein\u2019s theories of relativity provided far more than the\nsubject matter for these philosophical examinations. Logical\nempiricist philosophy of science itself was fashioned by\nlessons allegedly drawn from relativity theory in correcting or\nrebutting both neo-Kantian and Machian perspectives on general\nmethodological and epistemological questions of science. Several of\nthe most characteristic doctrines of logical empiricist philosophy of\nscience\u2014the interpretation of a priori elements in\nphysical theories as conventions, the treatment of the necessary role\nof conventions in linking theoretical concepts to observation, the\ninsistence on observational language definition of theoretical\nterms\u2014were taken to have been conclusively demonstrated by\nEinstein in fashioning his two theories of relativity. As mentioned\nabove, Einstein\u2019s 1905 analysis of the conventionality of\nsimultaneity in the special theory of relativity became a\nmethodological paradigm for logical empiricism; it prompted\nReichenbach\u2019s own method of \u201clogical analysis\u201d of\nphysical theories into subjective (definitional, conventional) and\nobjective (empirical) components. An overriding concern in the logical\nempiricist treatment of relativity theory was to draw broad lessons\nfor scientific methodology and philosophy of science generally,\nalthough issues more specific to the philosophy of physics were also\naddressed. Only the former are considered here; for a discussion of\nthe latter, see Ryckman 2007.\n",
