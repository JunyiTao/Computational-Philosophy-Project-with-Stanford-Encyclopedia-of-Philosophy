    "main_text": "Logic || Bolzano\u2019s Definition of Material Consequence and of Logical Consequence\n3.8 Bolzano\u2019s Definition of Material Consequence and of Logical Consequence\n\nBolzano\u2019s logical World 3 includes in addition to ideas and\npropositions also what we will call \u2018arguments\u2019. Bolzano\nis dealing with arguments at lengths in his Theory of Science\n(cf., e.g., WL II, 113 ff., 391 ff.), but he does not introduce a name\nfor them. Following the general line of his terminology, he could have\ncalled them \u2018Schl\u00fcsse an sich\u2019\n(\u2018derivations in themselves\u2019 or \u2018inferences in\nthemselves\u2019), but he did not; he rather used this term for a\ncertain kind of propositions, namely for propositions stating that a\nproposition follows (or \u2014 in his words \u2014 is\nableitbar, i.e., derivable) from a set of propositions (WL I,\n213, WL II, 200; for another usage of the term\n\u2018Schlu\u00df\u2019 by Bolzano cf. section 4.4). A Bolzanian\nargument consists of two sets of propositions: the set of its premises\nand the set of its conclusions. In order to simplify matters, we will\nassume here that an argument has always a single proposition (rather\nthan a whole set of propositions) as its conclusion, and we will\nidentify an argument with an ordered pair \\(\\langle \\sigma ,\ns\\rangle\\) consisting of a set \\(\\sigma\\) of propositions (i.e., the\nset of premises) and a single proposition \\(s\\) (i.e., its\nconclusion).\n\nBolzano first explains what it means that a single proposition \\(s\\)\nis derivable (ableitbar) from a set \\(\\sigma\\) of\npropositions with respect to a certain sequence \\(i\\) of ideas (WL II,\n113 ff., 198 ff.). Since Bolzano\u2019s term\n\u2018Ableitbarkeit\u2019 (\u2018derivability\u2019) is\nused nowadays in a purely syntactical sense, we use here instead the\nmore common phrases \u2018\\(s\\) follows from \\(\\sigma\\) with respect\nto \\(i\\)\u2019 or \u2018\\(s\\) is a consequence of \\(\\sigma\\) with\nrespect to \\(i\\)\u2019.\n\nWe have explained Bolzano\u2019s method of idea-variation in section\n3.6 with respect to single propositions. In order to apply it also to\narguments, we have now to extend our original definitions to whole\nsets of propositions. In applying the operation of variation\nto a set \\(\\sigma\\) of propositions, each member of \\(\\sigma\\) is\nreplaced by its corresponding variant: The j/i-variant of a\nset \\(\\sigma\\) of propositions is the set of all the \\(j/i\\)-variants\nof the members of \\(\\sigma\\). Moreover we will say of a set \\(\\sigma\\)\nof propositions that it is true iff each of its members is true; and\nwe will say that a sequence \\(j\\) of ideas verifies a set \\(\\sigma\\)\nof propositions with respect to \\(i\\) iff \\(j\\) verifies each member\nof \\(\\sigma\\) with respect to \\(i\\), i.e., iff the \\(j/i\\)-variant of\neach member of \\(\\sigma\\) is true. A proposition \\(s\\)\nfollows from a set \\(\\sigma\\) of propositions (or, in other\nwords, \\(s\\) is a consequence of \\(\\sigma)\\) with respect to\na sequence \\(i\\) of ideas iff every sequence \\(j\\) of ideas that\nverifies \\(\\sigma\\) with respect to \\(i\\) verifies \\(s\\) as well with\nrespect to \\(i\\).\n\nIn transferring this formulation into a formal definition, we have to\nbear in mind again that \u2018each\u2019 and \u2018every\u2019 has\nexistential import also in Bolzano\u2019s meta-language. The formal\ndefinition has therefore to be stated as follows:\n\ns follows from \\(\\sigma\\) with respect to \\(i\\) (or:\n\\(s\\) is a consequence of \\(\\sigma\\) with respect to\n\\(i)\\) iff there is a sequence \\(j\\) of ideas such that \\(j\\) verifies\n\\(\\sigma\\) with respect to \\(i\\), and every sequence \\(j\\) of ideas\nwhich verifies \\(\\sigma\\) with respect to \\(i\\), verifies \\(s\\)\nlikewise with respect to \\(i\\).\n\n\nIn this sense, e.g., the proposition [Kant is European] follows from\nthe set {[Kant is a philosopher], [Every philosopher is\nGerman]} with respect to the idea [philosopher]. The conclusion\nfollows, so to speak, \u201cmaterially\u201d from the premises, or\nis a \u201cmaterial\u201d consequence of the premises, due to the\nfact that every German is European. This is not enough, of course, for\nan argument to be logically correct. In order to be logically\ncorrect, the conclusion \\(s\\) of an argument \\(\\langle \\sigma ,\ns\\rangle\\) must logically follow from \\(\\sigma\\), i.e., \\(s\\)\nmust be a logical consequence of \\(\\sigma\\) (WL II,\n391\u2013395; the similarity with the distinction between material\nand formal consequence in Tarski 1956, 419, is obvious). A simple\ndefinition of logical consequence seems to suggest itself: \\(s\\)\nfollows logically from \\(\\sigma\\) (or: \\(s\\) is a logical\nconsequence of \\(\\sigma)\\) iff \\(s\\) follows from \\(\\sigma\\) with\nrespect to the sequence \\(i^{\\sigma \\cup \\{s\\}}\\) of all extra-logical\nsimple ideas contained in \\(\\sigma\\) or \\(s\\).\n\nThis simple answer, however, faces the same problems as the\ncorresponding answer with respect to logical truth (cf. section 3.7).\nAs we have done with logical truth and for the same reason, here too,\nwe must give priority to the logical form of an argument and\nthen proceed by this means to define the concept of logical\nconsequence for particular arguments.\n",
