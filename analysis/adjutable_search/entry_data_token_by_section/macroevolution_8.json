    "main_text": "Major Evolutionary Transitions\n9. Major Evolutionary Transitions\n\nIf one way to think about the larger picture of the history of life on\nEarth is to focus on evolutionary trends (size increase, complexity\nincrease, etc.), another approach is to focus on major transitional\nevents in the history of life (Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry\n1995; Szathm\u00e1ry & Maynard Smith 1995). The point of\ndeparture for most work on major transitions has been Szathm\u00e1ry\nand Maynard Smith\u2019s (1995: 228) list of game-changing\nalterations in evolutionary history:\n\nReplicating molecules to populations of molecules in\ncompartments\nUnlinked replicators to chromosomes\nRNA as gene and enzyme to DNA and protein (genetic code)\nProkaryotes to eukaryotes\nAsexual clones to sexual populations\nProtists to animals, plants, and fungi (cell differentiation)\nSolitary individuals to colonies (non-reproductive castes)\nPrimate societies to human societies (language)\n\n\nOne of Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\u2019s insights is that the\nvery mechanisms of evolution\u2014the way evolution works\u2014have\nchanged over the course of evolutionary history (Calcott &\nSterelny 2011).\n\nOne philosophical concern about the theory of major transitions is\nthat the original list was something of a mixed bag (McShea &\nSimpson 2011). For example, some of the transitions, like the\nevolution of eukaryotes and the evolution of multicellularity, seem to\ninvolve jumps in part/whole complexity. But others, like the evolution\nof sexual reproduction, do not. So it is not clear at all that these\nare transitions of the same kind. Indeed, Maynard Smith and\nSzathm\u00e1ry suggest that the transitions have three features: (1)\nchanges in the way that information is stored and transmitted; (2) new\ndivision of labor; and (3) individuals that could once reproduce\nindependently can no longer do so after the transition. Criterion (3),\nin particular, links the issue of major transitions to the larger\ndebate about the nature of biological individuality. One potential\nproblem, though, is that not all the transitions on the original list\nsatisfy all three criteria. For example, the shift from primate\nsocieties to human societies clearly involves (1) and (2), but not\n(3). To complicate things further, Szathm\u00e1ry (2015) revisits\nthe original list of transitions and proposes some changes.\n\nRelated to this worry that the major transitions do not comprise a\nunified type of evolutionary event, some theorists (e.g.,\nO\u2019Malley 2014) argue that other significant events should be\ncount as major transitions. O\u2019Malley & Powell (2016) think\nthat the biological oxygenation of Earth is a major transition, and\nCurrie (forthcoming) makes the case for treating mass extinctions as major\ntransitions.\n\nA second philosophical concern is that Maynard Smith and\nSzathm\u00e1ry\u2019s original idea looks a bit teleological, and\nin a way that likely raises the hackles of some scientists and\nphilosophers (e.g., Dawkins 1986; Dennett 1995). The transitions in\nSzathm\u00e1ry and Maynard Smith\u2019s (1995) list all seem like\nnecessary steps on the way to the evolution of humans, and cynically,\none might wonder if their relation to the later appearance of humans\nis what makes the transitions \u201cmajor\u201d. Relatedly, one\nmight wonder if the idea of major transitions comes a little too close\nto reviving pre-evolutionary thinking about the great chain of being.\nThis also connects with traditional questions about evolutionary\nprogress (Ruse 1997). While some of the concepts surveyed in this\nentry\u2014especially passive trends and historical\ncontingency\u2014might seem like threats to the belief in\nevolutionary progress, the theory of major transitions coheres well\nwith progressivist views about evolution.\n\nIn spite of these potential concerns, however, the major transitions\nreally are historical events that pose distinct explanatory\nchallenges. Arguably, our picture of macroevolution will not be\nentirely complete without tackling some of those challenges.\n\nIt is noteworthy that neither Maynard Smith nor Szathm\u00e1ry are\npaleontologists, and so there may be a bit of a disconnect between\ntheir original proposal and the way that many paleontologists have\ncome to think about major transitions. Several of the transitions from\nthe original list must have occurred way back in the deep past; the\nfossil record is not likely to give us much insight into the origin of\neukaryotes, for instance. Molecular tools may be able to shed some\nlight on macroevolutionary queries about the deep past, however\n(O\u2019Malley 2016). And paleontologists sometimes take a much\nbroader (and looser) view of major transitions, such that any major\nevolutionary novelty would count as a major transition. For instance,\nthe evolution of placentation in mammals, or the evolution of feathers\nin archosaurs, might count as major transitions on this broader view.\nCurrie (forthcoming) draws a distinction between theory-driven\napproaches to major transitions and phenomena-driven approaches.\nPaleontologists tend to fall in the latter camp, since they usually\nbegin by thinking about major morphological or phenotypic changes that\nshow up in the fossil record.\n",
