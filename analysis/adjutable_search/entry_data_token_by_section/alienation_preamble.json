    "main_text": "\n\nThe concept of alienation identifies a distinct kind of psychological\nor social ill; namely, one involving a problematic separation between\na self and other that belong together. So understood,\nalienation appears to play a largely diagnostic or critical role,\nsometimes said to suggest that something is awry with both\nliberal societies and liberal political philosophy. Theories of\nalienation typically pick out a subset of these problematic\nseparations as being of particular importance, and then offer\nexplanatory accounts of the extent of, and prognosis for, alienation,\nso understood. Discussions of alienation are especially, but not\nuniquely, associated with Hegelian and Marxist intellectual\ntraditions.\n\nThe present entry clarifies the basic idea of alienation. It\ndistinguishes alienation from some adjacent concepts; in particular,\nfrom \u2018fetishism\u2019 and \u2018objectification\u2019. And it\nelucidates some conceptual and normative complexities, including: the\ndistinction between subjective and objective alienation; the need for\na criterion by which candidate separations can be identified as\nproblematic; and (some aspects of) the relation between alienation and\nethical value. The empirical difficulties often generated by\nostensibly philosophical accounts of alienation are acknowledged, but\nnot resolved.\n",
