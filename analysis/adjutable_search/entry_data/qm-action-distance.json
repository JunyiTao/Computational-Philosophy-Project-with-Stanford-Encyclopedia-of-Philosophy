    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe quantum realm involves curious correlations between distant\nevents. A well-known example is David Bohm's (1951) version of\nthe famous thought experiment that Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen\nproposed in 1935 (henceforth, the EPR/B experiment). Pairs of particles\nare emitted from a source in the so-called spin singlet state and rush\nin opposite directions (see Fig. 1 below). When the particles are\nwidely separated from each other, they each encounter a measuring\napparatus that can be set to measure their spin components along\nvarious directions. Although the measurement events are distant from\neach other, so that no slower-than-light or light signal can travel\nbetween them, the measurement outcomes are curiously\n correlated.[1]\n That is, while the outcome of each of the distant spin measurements\nseems to be a matter of pure chance, they are correlated with each\nother: The joint probability of the distant outcomes is different from\nthe product of their single probabilities. For example, the\nprobability that each of the particles will spin clockwise about the\nz-axis in a z-spin measurement (i.e., a measurement\nof the spin component along the z direction) appears to be\n\u00bd. Yet, the outcomes of such measurements are perfectly\nanti-correlated: If the left-hand-side (L-) particle happens to spin\nclockwise (anti-clockwise) about the z-axis, the\nright-hand-side (R-) particle will spin anti-clockwise (clockwise)\nabout that axis. And this is true even if the measurements are made\nsimultaneously.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A schematic illustration of the EPR/B\nexperiment. Particle pairs in the spin singlet state are emitted in\nopposite directions and when they are distant from each other\n(i.e., space-like separated), they encounter measurement apparatuses\nthat can be set to measure spin components along various\ndirections.\n\n\n\nThe curious EPR/B correlations strongly suggest the existence of\nnon-local influences between the two measurement events, and indeed\northodox \u2018collapse\u2019 quantum mechanics supports this\nsuggestion. According to this theory, before the measurements the\nparticles do not have any definite spin. The particles come to possess\na definite spin only with the first spin measurement, and the outcome\nof this measurement is a matter of chance. If, for example, the first\nmeasurement is a z-spin measurement on the L-particle, the\nL-particle will spin either clockwise or anti-clockwise about the\nz-axis with equal chance. And the outcome of the\nL-measurement causes an instantaneous change in the spin properties of\nthe distant R-particle. If the L-particle spins clockwise\n(anti-clockwise) about the z-axis, the R-particle will\ninstantly spin anti-clockwise (clockwise) about the same axis. (It is\ncommon to call spins in opposite directions \u2018spin up\u2019 and\n\u2018spin down,\u2019 where by convention a clockwise spinning may\nbe called \u2018spin up\u2019 and anti-clockwise spinning may be\ncalled \u2018spin down.\u2019)\n\n\nIt may be argued that orthodox quantum mechanics is false, and that\nthe non-locality postulated by it does not reflect any non-locality in\nthe quantum realm. Alternatively, it may be argued that orthodox\nquantum mechanics is a good instrument for predictions rather than a\nfundamental theory of the physical nature of the universe. On this\ninstrumental interpretation, the predictions of quantum mechanics are\nnot an adequate basis for any conclusion about non-locality: This\ntheory is just an incredible oracle (or a crystal ball), which provides\na very successful algorithm for predicting measurement outcomes and\ntheir probabilities, but it offers little information about ontological\nmatters, such as the nature of objects, properties and causation in the\nquantum realm.\n\n\nEinstein, Podolsky and Rosen (1935) thought that quantum mechanics is\nincomplete and that the curious correlations between distant systems\ndo not amount to action at a distance between them. The apparent\ninstantaneous change in the R-particle's properties during the\nL-measurement is not really a change of properties, but rather a\nchange of knowledge. (For more about the EPR argument, see the entry\non the EPR argument, Redhead 1987, chapter 3, and Albert 1992, chapter\n3. For discussions of the EPR argument in the relativistic context,\nsee Ghirardi and Grassi 1994 and Redhead and La Riviere 1997.) On this\nview, quantum states of systems do not always reflect their complete\nstate. Quantum states of systems generally provide information about\nsome of the properties that systems possess and information\nabout the probabilities of outcomes of measurements on them, and this\ninformation does not generally reflect the complete state of the\nsystems. In particular, the information encoded in the spin singlet\nstate is about the probabilities of measurement outcomes of spin\nproperties in various directions, about the conditional probabilities\nthat the L- (R-) particle has a certain spin property given that the\nR- (L-) particle has another spin property, and about the\nanti-correlation between the spins that the particles may have in any\ngiven direction (for more details, see section 5.1). Thus, the outcome\nof a z-spin measurement on the L-particle and the spin\nsinglet state (interpreted as a state of knowledge) jointly provide\ninformation about the z-spin property of the R-particle. For\nexample, if the outcome of the L-measurement is z-spin\n\u2018up,\u2019 we know that the R-particle has z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019; and if we assume, as EPR did, that there is no\ncurious action at a distance between the distant wings (and that the\nchange of the quantum-mechanical state of the particle pair in the\nL-measurement is only a change in state of knowledge), we could also\nconclude that the R-particle had z-spin \u2018down\u2019\neven before the L-measurement occurs.\n\n\nHow could the L-outcome change our\nknowledge/ignorance about the R-outcome if it has no influence on it?\nThe simplest and most straightforward reply is that the L- and the R-\noutcome have a common cause that causes them to be correlated, so that\nknowledge of one outcome provides knowledge about the\n other.[2]\n Yet, the question is whether the predictions of orthodox quantum\nmechanics, which have been highly confirmed by various experiments,\nare compatible with the quantum realm being local in the sense of\ninvolving no influences between systems between which light and\nslower-than-light signals cannot travel (i.e., space-like separated\nsystems). More particularly, the question is whether it is possible to\nconstruct a local, common-cause model of the EPR/B experiment, i.e., a\nmodel that postulates no influence between systems/events in the\ndistant wings of the experiment, and that the correlation between them\nare due to the state of the particle pair at the source. In 1935,\nEinstein, Podolsky and Rosen believed that this is possible. But, as\nJohn Bell demonstrated in 1964, this belief is difficult to\nuphold.\n2. Bell's theorem and non-locality\n\n\nIn a famous theorem, John Bell (1964) demonstrated that granted some\nplausible assumptions, any local model of the EPR/B experiment is\ncommitted to certain inequalities about the probabilities of\nmeasurement outcomes, \u2018the Bell inequalities,\u2019 which are\nincompatible with the quantum-mechanical predictions. When Bell proved\nhis theorem, the EPR/B experiment was only a thought experiment. But\ndue to technological advances, various versions of this experiment have\nbeen conducted since the 1970s, and their results have overwhelmingly\nsupported the quantum-mechanical predictions (for brief reviews of\nthese experiments and further references, see the entry on Bell's\ntheorem and Redhead 1987, chapter 4, section 4.3 and \u2018Notes and\nReferences\u2019). Thus, a wide consensus has it that the quantum\nrealm involves some type of non-locality.\n\n\nThe basic idea of Bell's theorem is as follows. A model of the EPR/B\nexperiment postulates that the state of the particle pair together\nwith the apparatus settings to measure (or not to measure) certain\nspin properties determine the probabilities for single and joint\nspin-measurement outcomes. A local Bell model of this experiment also\npostulates that probabilities of joint outcomes factorize into the\nsingle probabilities of the L- and the R- outcomes: The probability of\njoint outcomes is equal to the product of the probabilities of the\nsingle outcomes. More formally, let \u03bb denote the pair's state\nbefore any measurement occurs. Let l denote the setting of\nthe L-measurement apparatus to measure spin along the l-axis\n(i.e., the l-spin of the L-particle), and let r\ndenote the setting of the R-measurement apparatus to measure spin\nalong the r-axis (i.e., the r-spin of the\nR-particle). Let xl be the outcome of a\nl-spin measurement in the L-wing, and let\nyr be the outcome of a r-spin measurement\nin the R-wing; where xl is either the L-outcome\nl-spin \u2018up\u2019 or the L-outcome l-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 and yr is either the R-outcome\nr-spin \u2018up\u2019 or the R-outcome r-spin\n\u2018down.\u2019 Let P\u03bb l\nr(xl & yr) be\nthe joint probability of the L- and the R-outcome, and\nP\u03bb\nl(xl) and\nP\u03bb\nr(yr) be the single\nprobabilities of the L- and the R-outcome, respectively; where the\nsubscripts \u03bb, l and r denote the factors that\nare relevant for the probabilities of the outcomes\nxl and yr. Then, for any\n\u03bb, l, r, xl and\n yr:[3]\n\nFactorizability\nP\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r(xl\n & yr) =\n P\u03bb\u2009l(xl)\n \u00b7\n P\u03bb\u2009r(yr).\n\n\n\n(Here and henceforth, for simplicity's sake we shall denote events and\nstates, such as the measurement outcomes, and the propositions that\nthey occur by the same symbols.)\n\n\nThe state \u03bb is typically thought of as the pair's state at the\nemission time, and it is assumed that this state does not change in\nany relevant sense between the emission and the first measurement. It\nis (generally) a different state from the quantum-mechanical pair's\nstate \u03c8. \u03c8 is assumed to be an incomplete state of the pair,\nwhereas \u03bb is supposed to be a (more) complete state of the\npair. Accordingly, pairs with the same state \u03c8 may have different\nstates \u03bb which give rise to different probabilities of outcomes\nfor the same type of measurements. Also, the states \u03bb may be\nunknown, hidden, inaccessible or uncontrollable.\n\n\nFactorizability is commonly motivated as a locality condition. In\nnon-local models of the EPR/B experiment, the correlations between the\ndistant outcomes are accounted for by non-local influences between the\ndistant measurement events. For example, in orthodox quantum mechanics\nthe first spin measurement on, say, the L-particle causes an immediate\nchange in the spin properties of the R-particle and in the\nprobabilities of future outcomes of spin measurements on this particle.\nBy contrast, in local models of this experiment the correlations are\nsupposed to be accounted for by a common cause\u2014the pair's\nstate \u03bb (see Fig. 2 below): The pair's state and the\nL-setting determine the probability of the L-outcome; the pair's\nstate and the R-setting determine the probability of the\nR-outcome; and the pair's state and the L- and the\nR-setting determine the probability of joint outcomes, which (as\nmentioned above) is simply the product of these single probabilities.\nThe idea is that the probability of each of the outcomes is determined\nby \u2018local events,\u2019 i.e., events that are confined to its\nbackward light-cone, and which can only exert subluminal or luminal\ninfluences on it (see Figure 3 below); and the distant outcomes are\nfundamentally independent of each other, and thus their joint\nprobability factorizes. (For more about this reasoning, see sections 6\nand 8-9.)\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A schematic common-cause model of the EPR/B\nexperiment.  Arrows denote causal connections.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A space-time diagram of a local model of\nthe EPR/B experiment. The circles represent the measurement events,\nand the cones represent their backward light cones, i.e., the\nboundaries of all the subluminal and luminal influences on them. The\ndotted lines denote the propagation of the influences of the pair's\nstate at the emission and of the settings of the measurement\napparatuses on the measurement outcomes.\n\n\n\nA Bell model of the EPR/B experiment also postulates that for each\nquantum-mechanical state \u03c8 there is a distribution \u03c1 over all\nthe possible pair states \u03bb, which is\nindependent of the settings of the apparatuses. That is, the\ndistribution of the (\u2018complete\u2019) states \u03bb depends on\nthe (\u2018incomplete\u2019) state \u03c8, and this distribution\nis independent of the particular choice of measurements in the L- and\nR-wing (including the choice not to measure any quantity). Or\nformally, for any quantum-mechanical state \u03c8, L-settings\nl and l\u2032, and R-settings r and\nr\u2032:\n\n\u03bb-independence \n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l\u2009r(\u03bb) =\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l\u2032\u2009r(\u03bb) =\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l\u2009r\u2032(\u03bb) =\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l\u2032\u2009r\u2032(\u03bb) =\n \u03c1\u03c8(\u03bb)\n\n\n\nwhere the subscripts denote the factors that are potentially\nrelevant for the distribution of the states \u03bb.\n\n\nAlthough the model probabilities (i.e., the probabilities of outcomes\nprescribed by the states \u03bb) are different from the\ncorresponding quantum-mechanical probabilities of outcomes (i.e., the\nprobabilities prescribed by the quantum-mechanical states \u03c8),\nthe quantum mechanical probabilities (which have been systematically\nconfirmed) are recovered by averaging over the model probabilities.\nThat is, it is supposed that the quantum-mechanical probabilities\nP\u03c8 l\nr(xl & yr),\nP\u03c8 l(xl)\nand\nP\u03c8 r(yr)\nare obtained by averaging over the model probabilities\nP\u03bb l\nr(xl & yr),\nP\u03bb l\n(xl) and\nP\u03bb r(yr),\nrespectively: For any \u03c8, l, r, xl and yr,\n\nEmpirical Adequacy \nP\u03c8\u2009l\u2009r(xl\n & yr) = \n   \u222b\u03bb\u2009P\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r(xl \n & yr) \u00b7\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l\u2009r(\u03bb)\nP\u03c8\u2009l(xl) \n =\n \u222b\u03bb\u2009P\u03bb\u2009l(xl )\n \u00b7\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009l(\u03bb)\nP\u03c8\u2009r(yr) \n =\n \u222b\u03bb\u2009P\u03bb\u2009r(yr)\n \u00b7\n \u03c1\u03c8\u2009r(\u03bb).[4]\n\n\n\nThe assumption of \u03bb-independence is very plausible. It\npostulates that (complete) pair states at the source are uncorrelated\nwith the settings of the measurement apparatuses. And independently of\none's philosophical view about free will, this assumption is strongly\nsuggested by our experience, according to which it seems possible to\nprepare the state of particle pairs at the source independently of the\nset up of the measurement apparatuses.\n\n\nThere are two ways to try to explain a failure of\n\u03bb-independence. One possible explanation is that\npairs' states and apparatus settings share a common cause, which\nalways correlates certain types of pairs' states \u03bb with\ncertain types of L- and R-setting. Such a causal hypothesis will be\ndifficult to reconcile with the common belief that apparatus settings\nare controllable at experimenters' will, and thus could be set\nindependently of the pair's state at the source. Furthermore,\nthinking of all the different ways one can measure spin properties and\nthe variety of ways in which apparatus settings can be chosen, the\npostulation of such common cause explanation for settings and\npairs' states would seem highly ad hoc and its existence\nconspiratorial.\n\n\nAnother possible explanation for the failure of \u03bb-independence\nis that the apparatus settings influence the pair's state at the\nsource, and accordingly the distribution of the possible pairs' states\n\u03bb is dependent upon the settings. Since the settings can be\nmade after the emission of the particle pair from the source, this\nkind of violation of \u03bb-independence would require backward\ncausation. (For advocates of this way out of non-locality, see Costa\nde Beauregard 1977, 1979, 1985, Sutherland 1983, 1998, 2006 and Price\n1984, 1994, 1996, chapters 3, 8 and 9.) On some readings of John\nCramer's (1980, 1986) transactional interpretation of quantum\nmechanics (see Maudlin 1994, pp. 197-199), such violation of\n\u03bb-independence is postulated. According to this interpretation,\nthe source sends \u2018offer\u2019 waves forward to the measurement\napparatuses, and the apparatuses send \u2018confirmation\u2019 waves\n(from the space-time regions of the measurement events) backward to\nthe source, thus affecting the states of emitted pairs according to\nthe settings of the apparatuses.  The question of whether such a\ntheory can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics is a\ncontroversial matter (see Maudlin 1994, pp. 197-199, Berkovitz 2002,\nsection 5, and Kastner 2006). It is noteworthy, however, that while\nthe violation of \u03bb-independence is sufficient for circumventing\nBell's theorem, the failure of this condition per se does not\nsubstantiate locality. The challenge of providing a local model of the\nEPR/B experiment also applies to models that violate\n\u03bb-independence. (For more about these issues, see sections 9\nand 10.3.)\n\n\nIn any case, as Bell's theorem demonstrates, factorizability,\n\u03bb-independence and empirical adequacy jointly imply the Bell\ninequalities, which are violated by the predictions of orthodox quantum\nmechanics (Bell 1964, 1966, 1971, 1975a,b). Granted the systematic\nconfirmation of the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics and the\nplausibility of \u03bb-independence, Bell inferred that\nfactorizability fails in the EPR/B experiment. Thus, interpreting\nfactorizability as a locality condition, he concluded that the quantum\nrealm is non-local. (For further discussions of Bell's theorem,\nthe Bell inequalities and non-locality, see Bell 1966, 1971, 1975a,b,\n1981, Clauser et al 1969, Clauser and Horne 1974, Shimony\n1993, chapter 8, Fine 1982a,b, Redhead 1987, chapter 4, Butterfield\n1989, 1992a, Pitowsky 1989, Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger 1989,\nGreenberger, Horne, Shimony and Zeilinger 1990, Mermin 1990, and the\nentry on Bell's theorem.)\n3. The analysis of factorizability\n\n\nFollowing Bell's work, a broad consensus has it that the\nquantum realm involves some type of non-locality (for examples, see\nClauser and Horne 1974, Jarrett 1984,1989, Shimony 1984, Redhead 1987,\nButterfield 1989, 1992a,b, 1994, Howard 1989, Healey 1991, 1992, 1994,\nTeller 1989, Clifton, Butterfield and Redhead 1990, Clifton 1991,\nMaudlin 1994, Berkovitz 1995a,b, 1998a,b, and references\n therein).[5]\n But there is an ongoing controversy as to its exact nature and its\ncompatibility with relativity theory. One aspect of this controversy\nis over whether the analysis of factorizability and the different ways\nit could be violated may shed light on these issues. Factorizability\nis equivalent to the conjunction of two conditions (Jarrett 1984,\n1989, Shimony\n 1984):[6]\n\nParameter independence. The probability of a distant\nmeasurement outcome in the EPR/B experiment is independent of the\nsetting of the nearby measurement apparatus.

A common view has it\nthat violations of PI involve a different type of non-locality than\nviolations of OI: Violations of PI involve some type of\naction-at-a-distance that is impossible to reconcile with relativity\n(Shimony 1984, Redhead 1987, p. 108), whereas violations of OI involve\nsome type of holism, non-separability and/or passion-at-a-distance that\nmay be possible to reconcile with relativity (Shimony 1984, Readhead\n1987, pp. 107, 168-169, Howard 1989, Teller 1989).\n\n\nOn the other hand, there is the view that the analysis above (as\nwell as other similar analyses of\n factorizability[7])\n is immaterial for studying quantum non-locality (Butterfield 1992a,\npp. 63-64, Jones and Clifton 1993, Maudlin 1994, pp. 96 and 149) and\neven misleading (Maudlin 1994, pp. 94-95 and 97-98). On this\nalternative view, the way to examine the nature of quantum\nnon-locality is to study the ontology postulated by the various\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics and alternative quantum\n theories.[8]\n In sections 4-7, we shall follow this methodology and discuss the\nnature of non-locality postulated by several quantum theories. The\ndiscussion in these sections will furnish the ground for evaluating\nthe above controversy in section 8.\n4. Action at a distance, holism and non-separability\n4.1 Action at a distance\n\n\nIn orthodox quantum mechanics as well as in any other current quantum\ntheory that postulates non-locality (i.e., influences between distant,\nspace-like separated systems), the influences between the distant\nmeasurement events in the EPR/B experiment do not propagate\ncontinuously in space-time. They seem to involve action at a\ndistance. Yet, a common view has it that these influences are due to\nsome type of holism and/or non-separability of states of composite\nsystems, which are characteristic of systems in entangled states (like\nthe spin singlet state), and which exclude the very possibility of\naction at a distance. The paradigm case of action at a distance is the\nNewtonian gravitational force. This force acts between distinct\nobjects that are separated by some (non-vanishing) spatial distance,\nits influence is symmetric (in that any two massive objects influence\neach other), instantaneous and does not propagate continuously in\nspace. And it is frequently claimed or presupposed that such action at\na distance could only exist between systems with separate states in\nnon-holistic universes (i.e., universes in which the states of\ncomposite systems are determined by, or supervene upon the states of\ntheir subsystems and the spacetime relations between them), which are\ncommonly taken to characterize the classical\n realm.[9]\n\n\nIn sections 4.2 and 4.3, we shall briefly review the relevant\nnotions of holism and non-separability (for a more comprehensive\nreview, see the entry on holism and nonseparability in physics and\nHealey 1991). In section 5, we shall discuss the nature of holism and\nnon-separability in the quantum realm as depicted by various quantum\ntheories. Based on this discussion, we shall consider whether the\nnon-local influences in the EPR/B experiment constitute action at a\ndistance.\n4.2 Holism\n\n\nIn the literature, there are various characterizations of holism.\nDiscussions of quantum non-locality frequently focus on property\nholism, where certain physical properties of objects are not determined\nby the physical properties of their parts. The intuitive idea is that\nsome intrinsic properties of wholes (e.g. physical systems) are not\ndetermined by the intrinsic properties of their parts and the\nspatiotemporal relations that obtain between these parts. This idea can\nbe expressed in terms of supervenience relations.\n\nProperty Holism. Some objects have intrinsic\nqualitative properties and/or relations that do not supervene upon the\nintrinsic qualitative properties and relations of their parts and the\nspatiotemporal relations between these parts.\n\n\nIt is difficult to give a general precise specification of the terms\n\u2018intrinsic qualitative property\u2019 and\n\u2018supervenience.\u2019 Intuitively, a property of an object is\nintrinsic just in case that object has this property in and for itself\nand independently of the existence or the state of any other object. A\nproperty is qualitative (as opposed to individual) if it does not\ndepend on the existence of any particular object. And the intrinsic\nqualitative properties of an object O supervene upon the\nintrinsic qualitative properties and relations of its parts and the\nspatiotemporal relations between them just in case there is no change\nin the properties and relations of O without a change in the\nproperties and relations of its parts and/or the spatiotemporal\nrelations between them. (For attempts to analyze the term\n\u2018intrinsic property,\u2019 see for example Langton and Lewis\n1998 and the entry on intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties. For a review\nof different types of supervenience, see for example Kim 1978,\nMcLaughlin 1994 and the entry on supervenience.)\n\n\nPaul Teller (1989, p. 213) proposes a related notion of holism,\n\u2018relational holism,\u2019 which is characterized as the\nviolation of the following condition:\n\nParticularism. The world is composed of\nindividuals. All individuals have non-relational properties and all\nrelations supervene on the non-relational properties of the\nrelata.\n\n\nHere, by a non-relational property Teller means an intrinsic property\n(1986a, p. 72); and by \u2018the supervenience of a relational\nproperty on the non-relational properties of the relata,\u2019 he\nmeans that \u2018if two objects, 1 and 2, bear a relation R\nto each other, then, necessarily, if two further objects,\n1\u2032 and 2\u2032 have the same non-relational properties, then\n1\u2032 and 2\u2032 will also bear the same relation R to\neach other\u2019 (1989, p. 213). Teller (1986b, pp.  425-7) believes\nthat spatiotemporal relations between objects supervene upon the\nobjects\u2019 intrinsic physical properties. Thus, he does not\ninclude the spatiotemporal relations in the supervenience basis.  This\nview is controversial, however, as many believe that spatiotemporal\nrelations between objects are neither intrinsic nor supervene upon the\nintrinsic qualitative properties of these objects.  But, if such\nsupervenience does not obtain, particularism will also be violated in\nclassical physics, and accordingly relational holism will fail to mark\nthe essential distinction between the classical and the quantum\nrealms. Yet, one may slightly revise Teller's definition of\nparticularism as follows:\n\nParticularism*. The world is composed of\nindividuals. All individuals have non-relational properties and all\nrelations supervene upon the non-relational properties of the relata\nand the spatiotemporal relations between them.\n\n\nIn what follows in this entry, by relational holism we shall mean a\nviolation of particularism*.\n4.3 Non-separability\n\n\nLike holism, there are various notions of non-separability on offer.\nThe most common notion in the literature is state non-separability,\ni.e., the violation of the following condition:\n\nState separability. Each system possesses a\nseparate state that determines its qualitative intrinsic properties,\nand the state of any composite system is wholly determined by the\nseparate states of its subsystems.\n\n\nThe term \u2018wholly determined\u2019 is vague. But, as before, one\nmay spell it out in terms of supervenience relations: State\nseparability obtains just in case each system possesses a separate\nstate that determines its qualitative intrinsic properties and\nrelations, and the state of any composite system is supervenient upon\nthe separate states of its subsystems.\n\n\nAnother notion of non-separability is spatiotemporal non-separability.\nInspired by Einstein (1948), Howard (1989, pp. 225-6) characterizes\nspatiotemporal non-separability as the violation of the following\nseparability condition:\n\nSpatiotemporal separability. The contents of any\ntwo regions of space-time separated by a non-vanishing spatiotemporal\ninterval constitute two separate physical systems. Each separated\nspace-time region possesses its own, distinct state and the joint state\nof any two separated space-time regions is wholly determined by the\nseparated states of these regions.\n\n\nA different notion of spatiotemporal non-separability, proposed by\nHealey (see the entry on holism and nonseparability in physics), is\nprocess non-separability. It is the violation of the following\ncondition:\n\nProcess separability. Any physical process\noccupying a spacetime region R supervenes upon an assignment\nof qualitative intrinsic physical properties at spacetime points in\nR.\n5. Holism, non-separability and action at a distance in quantum mechanics\n\n\nThe quantum realm as depicted by all the quantum theories that\npostulate non-locality, i.e., influences between distant (space-like\nseparated) systems, involves some type of non-separability or\nholism. In what follows in this section, we shall consider the nature\nof the non-separability and holism manifested by various\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics. On the basis of this\nconsideration, we shall address the question of whether these\ninterpretations predicate the existence of action at a distance.  We\nstart with the so-called \u2018collapse theories.\u2019\n5.1 Collapse theories\n5.1.1 Orthodox quantum mechanics\n\n\nIn orthodox quantum mechanics, normalized vectors in Hilbert spaces\nrepresent states of physical systems. When the Hilbert space is of\ninfinite dimension, state vectors can be represented by functions, the\nso-called \u2018wave functions.\u2019 In any given basis, there is a\nunique wave function that corresponds to the state vector in that\nbasis. (For an entry level review of the highlights of the\nmathematical formalism and the basic principles of quantum mechanics,\nsee the entry on quantum mechanics, Albert 1992, Hughes 1989, Part I,\nand references therein; for more advanced reviews, see Bohm 1951 and\nRedhead 1987, chapters 1-2 and the mathematical appendix.)\n\n\nFor example, the state of the L-particle having z-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 (i.e., spinning \u2018up\u2019 about the\nz-axis) can be represented by the vector |z-up>\nin the Hilbert space associated with the L-particle, and the state of\nthe L-particle having z-spin \u2018down\u2019 (i.e.,\nspinning \u2018down\u2019 about the z-axis) can be\nrepresented by the orthogonal vector, |z-down>. Particle\npairs may be in a state in which the L-particle and the R-particle\nhave opposite spins, for instance either a state\n|\u03c81> in which the L-particle has z-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 and the R-particle has z-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 or a state |\u03c82> in which the\nL-particle has z-spin \u2018down\u2019 and the R-particle\nhas z-spin \u2018up.\u2019 Each of these states is\nrepresented by a tensor product of vectors in the Hilbert space of the\nparticle pair:\n |\u03c81>\n = |z-up>L\n|z-down>R and |\u03c82> =\n|z-down>L\n|z-up>R; where the subscripts L and R\nrefer to the Hilbert spaces associated with the L- and the R-particle,\nrespectively. But particle pairs may also be in a superposition of\nthese states, i.e., a state that is a linear sum of the states\n|\u03c81> and |\u03c82>, e.g. the state\nrepresented by\n\n\n\n|\u03c83>\n = \n1/\u221a2 (|\u03c81>\n\u2212 |\u03c82>)\n\n\n\n = \n1/\u221a2\n(|z-up>L\n|z-down>R\n\u2212 |z-down>L\n|z-up>R).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, this is exactly the case in the spin singlet state. In this\nstate, the particles are entangled in a non-separable state (i.e., a\nstate that cannot be decomposed into a product of separate states of\nthe L- and the R-particle), in which (according to the\nproperty-assignment rules of orthodox quantum mechanics) the particles\ndo not possess any definite z-spin (or definite spin in any\nother direction). Thus, the condition of state separability fails: The\nstate of the particle pair (which determines its intrinsic qualitative\nproperties) is not wholly determined by the separate states of the\nparticles (which determine their intrinsic qualitative properties). Or\nmore precisely, the pair's state is not supervenient upon the\nseparable states of the particles. In particular, the superposition\nstate of the particle pair assigns a \u2018correlational\u2019\nproperty that dictates that the outcomes of (ideal) z-spin\nmeasurements on both the L- and the R-particle will be\nanti-correlated, and this correlational property is not supervenient\nupon properties assigned by any separable states of the particles (for\nmore details, see Healey 1992, 1994). For similar reasons, the spin\nsinglet state also involves property and relational holism; for the\nabove correlational property of the particle pair also fails to\nsupervene upon the intrinsic qualitative properties of the particles\nand the spatiotemporal relations between them. Furthermore, the\nprocess that leads to each of the measurement outcomes is also\nnon-separable, i.e.,  process separability fails (see Healey 1994 and\nthe entry on holism and nonseparability in physics).\n\n\nThis correlational property is also \u2018responsible\u2019 for the\naction at a distance that the orthodox theory seems to postulate\nbetween the distant wings in the EPR/B experiment. Recall (section 1)\nthat Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen thought that this curious action at\na distance reflects the incompleteness of this theory rather than a\nstate of nature. The EPR argument for the incompleteness of the\northodox theory is controversial. But the orthodox theory seems to be\nincomplete for a different reason. This theory postulates that in\nnon-measurement interactions, the evolution of states obeys a linear\nand unitary equation of motion, the so-called Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation (see the entry on quantum mechanics), according to which the\nparticle pair in the EPR/B experiment remains in an entangled\nstate. This equation of motion also dictates that in a spin\nmeasurement, the pointers of the measurement apparatuses get entangled\nwith the particle pair in a non-separable state in which (according to\nthe theory's property assignment, see below) the indefiniteness of\nparticles\u2019 spins is \u2018transmitted\u2019 to the pointer's\nposition: In this entangled state of the particle pair and the\npointer, the pointer lacks any definite position, in contradiction to\nour experience of perceiving it pointing to either \u2018up\u2019 or\n\u2018down.\u2019\n\n\nThe above problem, commonly called \u2018the measurement\nproblem,\u2019 arises in orthodox no-collapse quantum mechanics from\ntwo features that account very successfully for the behavior of\nmicroscopic systems: The linear dynamics of quantum states as\ndescribed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the property assignment\nrule called \u2018eigenstate-eigenvalue link.\u2019 According to the\neigenstate-eigenvalue link, a physical observable, i.e., a physical\nquantity, of a system has definite value (one of its eigenvalues) just\nin case the system is in the corresponding eigenstate of that\nobservable (see the entry on quantum mechanics, section\n4). Microscopic systems may be in a superposition state of spin\ncomponents, energies, positions, momenta as well as other physical\nobservables. Accordingly, microscopic systems may be in a state of\nindefinite z-spin, energy, position, momentum and various\nother quantities. The problem is that given the linear and unitary\nSchr\u00f6dinger dynamics, these indefinite quantities are also\nendemic in the macroscopic realm. For example, in a z-spin\nmeasurement on a particle in a superposition state of z-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 and z-spin \u2018down,\u2019 the position\nof the apparatus\u2019s pointer gets entangled with the indefinite\nz-spin of the particle, thus transforming the pointer into a\nstate of indefinite position, i.e., a superposition of pointing\n\u2018up\u2019 and pointing \u2018down\u2019 (see Albert 1992,\nchapter 4, and the entry on collapse theories, section 3). In\nparticular, in the EPR/B experiment the L-measurement causes the\nL-apparatus pointer to get entangled with the particle pair,\ntransforming it into a state of indefinite position:\n\n\n |\u03c84> = 1/\u221a2\n(|z-up>L \n|z-down>R\n|up>LA \u2212 \n|z-down>L \n|z-up>R \n|down>LA)\n\n\n\n\nwhere |up>LA and\n|down>LA are the states of the L-apparatus\npointer displaying the outcomes z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and\nz-spin \u2018down,\u2019 respectively. Since the above type\nof indefiniteness is generic in orthodox no-collapse quantum\nmechanics, in this theory measurements typically have no definite\noutcomes, in contradiction to our experience.\n\n\nIn order to solve this problem, the orthodox theory postulates that in\nmeasurement interactions, entangled states of measured systems and the\ncorresponding measurement apparatuses do not evolve according to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. Rather, they undergo a\n\u2018collapse\u2019 into product (non-entangled) states, where the\nsystems involved have the relevant definite properties. For example,\nthe entangled state of the particle pair and the L-apparatus in the\nEPR/B experiment may collapse into a product state in which the\nL-particle comes to possess z-spin \u2018up,\u2019 the\nR-particle comes to possess z-spin \u2018down\u2019 and the\nL-apparatus pointer displaying the outcome z-spin\n\u2018up\u2019:\n\n |\u03c85> = \n|z-up>L \n|z-down>R\n|up>LA.\n\n\nThe problem is that in the orthodox theory, the notions of\nmeasurement and the time, duration and nature of state collapses remain\ncompletely unspecified. As John Bell (1987b, p. 205) remarks, the\ncollapse postulate in this theory, i.e., the postulate that dictates\nthat in measurement interactions the entangled states of the relevant\nsystems do not follow the Schr\u00f6dinger equation but rather undergo\na collapse, is no more than \u2018supplementary, imprecise, verbal,\nprescriptions.\u2019\n\n\nThis problem of accounting for our experience of perceiving definite\nmeasurement outcomes in orthodox quantum mechanics, is an aspect of the\nmore general problem of accounting for the classical-like behavior of\nmacroscopic systems in this theory.\n5.1.2 Dynamical models for state vector reduction\n\n\nThe dynamical models for state-vector reduction were developed to\naccount for state collapses as real physical processes (for a review\nof the collapse models and a detailed reference list, see the entry on\ncollapse theories). The origin of the collapse models may be dated to\nBohm and Bub's (1966) hidden variable theory and Pearle's (1976)\nspontaneous localization approach, but the program has received its\ncrucial impetus with the more sophisticated models developed by\nGhirardi, Rimini and Weber in 1986 (see also Bell 1987a and Albert\n1992) and their consequent development by Pearle (1989) (see also\nGhirardi, Pearle and Rimini 1990, and Butterfield et al. 1993).\nSimilarly to orthodox collapse quantum mechanics, in the GRW models\nthe quantum-mechanical state of systems (whether it is expressed by a\nvector or a wave function) provides a complete specification of their\nintrinsic properties and relations. The state of systems follows the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, except that it has a probability for\nspontaneous collapse, independently of whether or not the systems are\nmeasured. The chance of collapse depends on the \u2018size\u2019 of\nthe entangled systems\u2014in the earlier models the \u2018size\u2019\nof systems is predicated on the number of the elementary particles,\nwhereas in later models it is measured in terms of mass densities. In\nany case, in microscopic systems, such as the particle pairs in the\nEPR/B experiment, the chance of collapse is very small and\nnegligible\u2014the chance of spontaneous state collapse in such\nsystems is cooked up so that it will occur, on average, every hundred\nmillion years or so. This means that the chance that the entangled\nstate of the particle pair in the EPR/B experiment will collapse to a\nproduct state between the emission from the source and the first\nmeasurement is virtually zero. In an earlier L-measurement, the state\nof the particle pair gets entangled with the state of the\nL-measurement apparatus.  Thus, the state of the pointer of the\nL-apparatus evolves from being \u2018ready\u2019 to measure a\ncertain spin property to an indefinite outcome. For instance, in a\nz-spin measurement the L-apparatus gets entangled with the\nparticle pair in a superposition state of pointing to \u2018up\u2019\nand pointing to \u2018down\u2019 (corresponding to the states of the\nL-particle having z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and having\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019), and the R-apparatus remains\nun-entangled with these systems in the state of being ready to measure\nz-spin. Or formally:\n\n\n |\u03c86> = 1/\u221a2\n(|z-up>L \n|up>AL \n|z-down>R \u2212 \n|z-down>L \n|down>AL \n|z-up>R) \n|ready>AR\n\n\n\n\nwhere, as before, |up>AL and\n|down>AL denote the states of the L-apparatus\ndisplaying the outcomes z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and\n\u2018down\u2019 respectively, and |ready>AR\ndenotes the state of the R-apparatus being ready to measure\nz-spin. In this state, a gigantic number of particles of the\nL-apparatus pointer are entangled together in the superposition state\nof being in the position (corresponding to pointing to)\n\u2018up\u2019 and the position (corresponding to pointing to)\n\u2018down.\u2019 For assuming, for simplicity of presentation, that\nthe position of all particles of the L-apparatus pointer in the state\nof pointing to \u2018up\u2019 (\u2018down\u2019) is the same, the\nstate |\u03c86> can be rewritten as:\n\n\n |\u03c87> = 1/\u221a2\n(|z-up>L \n|up>p1 \n|up>p2 \n|up>p3 \u2026 \n|z-down>R \u2212\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n |z-down>L \n|down>p1 \n|down>p2 \n|down>p3 \u2026 \n|z-up>R) |ready\n>AR\n\n\n\n\nwhere pi denotes the i-particle of the\nL-apparatus pointer, and |up>pi\n(|down>pi) is the state of the\ni-particle being in the position corresponding to the outcome\nz-spin \u2018up\u2019\n (\u2018down\u2019).[10]\n The chance that at least one of the vast number of the pointer's\nparticles will endure a spontaneous localization toward\nbeing in the position corresponding to either the outcome\nz-spin \u2018up\u2019 or the outcome z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 within a very short time (a split of a micro\nsecond) is very high. And since all the particles of the pointer and\nthe particle pair are entangled with each other, such a collapse will\ncarry with it a collapse of the entangled state of the pointer of the\nL-apparatus and the particle pair toward either\n\n |z-up>L |up>p1 |up>p2\n|up>p3 \u2026 \n|z-down>R\n\n\n or\n\n |z-down>L |down>p1 |down>p2\n|down>p3 \u2026 \n|z-up>R.\n\n Thus, the pointer will very quickly move in the direction of pointing\nto either the outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019 or the outcome\nz-spin \u2018down.\u2019\n\n\nIf (as portrayed above) the spontaneous localization of particles were\nto a precise position, i.e., to the position corresponding to the\noutcome \u2018up\u2019 or the outcome \u2018down,\u2019 the GRW\ncollapse models would successfully resolve the measurement\nproblem. Technically speaking, a precise localization is achieved by\nmultiplying |\u03c87> by a delta function centered on the\nposition corresponding to either the outcome \u2018up\u2019 or the\noutcome \u2018down\u2019 (see the entry on collapse theories,\nsection 5 and Albert 1992, chapter 5); where the probability of each\nof these mutually exhaustive possibilities is \u00bd. The problem is\nthat it follows from the uncertainty principle (see the entry on the\nuncertainty principle) that in such localizations the momenta and the\nenergies of the localized particles would be totally uncertain, so\nthat gases may spontaneously heat up and electrons may be knocked out\nof their orbits, in contradiction to our experience. To avoid this\nkind of problems, GRW postulated that spontaneous localizations are\ncharacterized by multiplications by Gaussians that are centered around\ncertain positions, e.g. the position corresponding to either the\noutcome \u2018up\u2019 or the outcome \u2018down\u2019 in the\nstate |\u03c87>. This may be problematic, because in\neither case the state of the L-apparatus pointer at (what we\ncharacteristically conceive as) the end of the L-measurement would be\na superposition of the positions \u2018up\u2019 and\n\u2018down.\u2019 For although this superposition\n\u2018concentrates\u2019 on either the outcome \u2018up\u2019 or\nthe outcome \u2018down\u2019 (i.e.,  the peak of the wave function\nthat corresponds to this state concentrates on one of these\npositions), it also has \u2018tails\u2019 that go everywhere: The\nstate of the L-apparatus is a superposition of an infinite number of\ndifferent positions. Thus, it follows from the eigenstate-eigenvalue\nlink that the position observable of the L-apparatus has no definite\nvalue at the end of the measurement.  But if the position observable\nhaving a definite value is indeed required in order for the\nL-apparatus to have a definite location, then the pointer will point\nto neither \u2018up\u2019 nor \u2018down,\u2019 and the GRW\ncollapse models will fail to reproduce the classical-like behavior of\nsuch\n systems.[11]\n\n\nIn later models, GRW proposed to interpret the quantum state as a\ndensity of mass and they postulated that if almost all the density of\nmass of a system is concentrated in a certain region, then the system\nis located in that region. Accordingly, pointers of\nmeasurement apparatuses do have definite positions at the end of\nmeasurement interactions. Yet, this solution has also given rise to a\ndebate (see Albert and Loewer 1995, Lewis 1997, 2003a, 2004, Ghirardi\nand Bassi 1999, Bassi and Ghirardi 1999, 2001, Clifton and Monton 1999,\n2000, Frigg 2003, and Parker 2003).\n\n\nThe exact details of the collapse mechanism and its characteristics in\nthe GRW/Pearle models have no significant implications for the type of\nnon-separability and holism they postulate\u2014all these models\nbasically postulate the same kinds of non-separability and holism as\northodox quantum mechanics (see section 5.1.1). And action at a\ndistance between the L- and the R-wing will occur if the L-measurement\ninteraction, a supposedly local event in the L-wing, causes some local\nevents in the R-wing, such as the event of the pointer of the\nmeasurement apparatus coming to possess a definite measurement outcome\nduring the R-measurement. That is, action at a distance will occur if\nthe L-measurement causes the R-particle to come to possess a definite\nz-spin and this in turn causes the pointer of the R-apparatus\nto come to possess the corresponding measurement outcome in the\nR-measurement. Furthermore, if the L-measurement causes the R-particle\nto come to possess (momentarily) a definite position in the R-wing,\nthen the action at a distance between the L- and the R-wing will occur\nindependently of whether the R-particle undergoes a spin\nmeasurement.\n\n\nThe above discussion is based on an intuitive notion of action at a\ndistance and it presupposes that action at a distance is compatible\nwith non-separability and holism. In the next section we shall provide\nmore precise characterizations of action at a distance and in light of\nthese characterizations reconsider the question of the nature of\naction at a distance in the GRW/Pearle collapse models.\n5.2 Can action-at-a-distance co-exist with non-separability and holism?\n\n\nThe action at a distance in the GRW/Pearle models is different from\nthe Newtonian action at a distance in various respects. First, in\ncontrast to Newtonian action at a distance, this action is independent\nof the distance between the measurement events. Second, while\nNewtonian action is symmetric, the action in the GRW/Pearle models is\n(generally) asymmetric: Either the L-measurement influences the\nproperties of the R-particle or the R-measurement influences the\nproperties of the L-particle, depending on which measurement occurs\nfirst (the action will be symmetric when both measurements occur\nsimultaneously). Third (and more important to our consideration), in\ncontrast to Newtonian action at a distance, before the end of the\nL-measurement the state of the L-apparatus and the R-particle is not\nseparable and accordingly it is not clear that the influence is\nbetween separate existences, as the case is supposed to be in\nNewtonian gravity.\n\n\nThis non-separability of the states of the particle pair and the\nL-measurement apparatus, and more generally the fact that the\nnon-locality in collapse theories is due to state non-separability, has\nled a number of philosophers and physicists to think that wave\ncollapses do not involve action at a distance. Yet, the question of\nwhether there is an action at a distance in the GRW/Pearle models (and\nvarious other quantum theories) depends on how we interpret the term\n\u2018action at a distance.\u2019 And, as I will suggest below, on a\nnatural reading of Isaac Newton's and Samuel Clarke's\ncomments concerning action at a distance, there may be a peaceful\ncoexistence between action at a distance and non-separability and\nholism.\n\n\nNewton famously struggled to find out the cause of\n gravity.[12]\n In a letter to Bentley, dated January 17 1692/3, he said:\n\n\nYou sometimes speak of Gravity as essential and inherent to Matter.\nPray do not ascribe that Notion to me, for the Cause of Gravity is what\nI do not pretend to know, and therefore would take more Time to\nconsider it. (Cohen 1978, p. 298)\n\n\nIn a subsequent letter to Bentley, dated February 25, 1692/3, he\nadded:\n\n\nIt is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the\nMediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and\naffect other matter without mutual Contact\u2026That Gravity should\nbe innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act\nupon another at a distance thro\u2019 a Vacuum, without the Mediation\nof any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be\nconveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I\nbelieve no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of\nthinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an Agent\nacting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this Agent be\nmaterial or immaterial, I have left to the Consideration of my\nreaders. (Cohen 1978, pp. 302-3)\n\n\nSamuel Clarke, Newton's follower, similarly struggled with the\nquestion of the cause of gravitational phenomenon. In his famous\ncontroversy with Leibniz, he\n said:[13]\n\n\nThat one body attracts another without any intermediate means, is\nindeed not a miracle but a contradiction; for 'tis supposing\nsomething to act where it is not. But the means by which two bodies\nattract each other, may be invisible and intangible and of a different\nnature from mechanism \u2026\n\n\nAnd he added:\n\n\nThat this phenomenon is not produced sans moyen, that is\nwithout a cause capable of producing such an effect, is undoubtedly\ntrue. Philosophers therefore can search after and discover that cause,\nif they can; be it mechanical or not. But if they cannot discover the\ncause, is therefore the effect itself, the phenomenon, or the matter of\nfact discovered by experience \u2026 ever the less true?\n\n\nNewton's and Clarke's comments suggest that for them\ngravity was a law-governed phenomenon, i.e., a phenomenon in which\nobjects influence each other at a distance according to the Newtonian\nlaw of gravity, and that this influence is due to some means which may\nbe invisible and intangible and of a different nature from mechanism.\nOn this conception of action at a distance, there seems to be no reason\nto exclude the possibility of action at a distance in the quantum realm\neven if that realm is holistic or the state of the relevant systems is\nnon-separable. That is, action at a distance may be characterized as\nfollows:\n\nAction at a distance is a phenomenon in which a\nchange in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the\nintrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the\ninfluence of any other systems on the distant system, and without\nthere being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space\nand time.\n \n\n\nWe may alternatively characterize action at a distance in a more\nliberal way:\n\nAction* at a distance is a phenomenon in which a\nchange in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the\nintrinsic properties of a distant system without there being a process\nthat carries this influence contiguously in space and time.\n \n\n\nAnd while Newton and Clarke did not have an explanation for the action\nat a distance involved in Newtonian gravity, on the above\ncharacterizations action at a distance in the quantum realm would be\nexplained by the holistic nature of the quantum realm and/or\nnon-separability of the states of the systems involved. In particular,\nif in the EPR/B experiment the L-apparatus pointer has a definite\nposition before the L-measurement and the R-particle temporarily comes\nto possess definite position during the L-measurement, then the\nGRW/Pearle models involve action at a distance and thus also action*\nat a distance. On the other hand, if the R-particle never comes to\npossess a definite position during the L-measurement, then the\nGRW/Pearle models only involve action* at a distance.\n5.3 No-collapse theories\n5.3.1 Bohm's theory\n\n\nIn 1952, David Bohm proposed a deterministic, \u2018hidden\nvariables\u2019 quantum theory that reproduces all the observable\npredictions of orthodox quantum mechanics (see Bohm 1952, Bohm,\nSchiller and Tiomno 1955, Bell 1982, Dewdney, Holland and Kyprianidis\n1987, D\u00fcrr, Goldstein and Zangh\u00ec 1992a, 1997, Albert 1992,\nValentini 1992, Bohm and Hiley 1993, Holland 1993, Cushing 1994, and\nCushing, Fine and Goldstein 1996; for an entry level review, see the\nentry on Bohmian mechanics and Albert 1992, chapter 5).\n\n\nIn contrast to orthodox quantum mechanics and the GRW/Pearle\ncollapse models, in Bohm's theory wave functions always evolve\naccording to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and thus they never\ncollapse. Wave functions do not represent the states of systems.\nRather, they are states of a \u2018quantum field (on configuration\nspace)\u2019 that influences the states of\n systems.[14]\n Also, particles always have definite positions, and the positions of\nthe particles and their wave function at a certain time jointly\ndetermine the trajectories of the particles at all future times. Thus,\nparticles\u2019 positions and their wave function determine the\noutcomes of any measurements (so long as these outcomes are recorded\nin the positions of some physical systems, as in any practical\nmeasurements).\n\n\nThere are various versions of Bohm's theory. In the\n\u2018minimal\u2019 Bohm theory, formulated by Bell\n (1982),[15]\n the wave function is interpreted as a \u2018guiding\u2019 field\n(which has no source or any dependence on the particles) that\ndeterministically governs the trajectories of the particles according\nto the so-called \u2018guiding equation\u2019 (which expresses the\nvelocities of the particles in terms of the wave\n function).[16]\n The states of systems are separable (the state of any composite\nsystem is completely determined by the state of its subsystems), and\nthey are completely specified by the particles\u2019\npositions. Spins, and any other properties which are not directly\nderived from positions, are not intrinsic properties of\nsystems. Rather, they are relational properties that are determined by\nthe systems\u2019 positions and the guiding field. In particular,\neach of the particles in the EPR/B experiment has dispositions to\n\u2018spin\u2019 in various directions, and these dispositions are\nrelational properties of the particles\u2014 they are\n(generally) determined by the guiding field and the positions of the\nparticles relative to the measurement apparatuses and to each\nother.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. The EPR/B experiment with Stern-Gerlach\nmeasurement devices. Stern-Gerlach 1 is on, set up to measure the\nz-spin of the L-particle, and Stern-Gerlach 2 is off. The\nhorizontal lines in the left-hand-side denote the trajectories of six\nL-particles in the spin singlet state after an (impulsive)\nz-spin measurement on the L-particle, and the horizontal\nlines in the right-hand-side denote the trajectories of the\ncorresponding R-particles. The center plane is aligned orthogonally to\nthe z-axis, so that particles that emerge above this plane\ncorrespond to z-spin \u2018up\u2019 outcome and particles\nthat emerge below this plane correspond to z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 outcome. The little arrows denote the\nz-spin components of the particles in the\n\u2018non-minimal\u2019 Bohm theory (where spins are intrinsic\nproperties of particles), and are irrelevant for the\n\u2018minimal\u2019 Bohm theory (where spins are not intrinsic\nproperties of particles).\n\n\n\n\nTo see the nature of non-locality postulated by the minimal Bohm\ntheory, consider again the EPR/B experiment and suppose that the\nmeasurement apparatuses are Stern-Gerlach (S-G) magnets which are\nprepared to measure z-spin. In any run of the experiment, the\nmeasurement outcomes will depend on the initial positions of the\nparticles and the order of the measurements. Here is why. In the\nminimal Bohm theory, the spin singlet state denotes the relevant state\nof the guiding field rather than the intrinsic properties of the\nparticle pair. If the L-measurement occurs before the R-measurement,\nthe guiding field and the position of the L-particle at the emission\ntime jointly determine the disposition of the L-particle to emerge\nfrom the S-G device either above or below a plane aligned in the\nz-direction; where emerging above (below) the plane means\nthat the L-particle z-spins \u2018up\u2019\n(\u2018down\u2019) about the z-axis and the L-apparatus\n\u2018pointer\u2019 points to \u2018up\u2019 (\u2018down\u2019)\n(see Fig. 4 above). All the L-particles that are emitted above the\ncenter plane aligned orthogonally to the z-direction, like\nthe L-particles 1-3, will be disposed to spin \u2018up\u2019; and\nall the particles that are emitted below this plane, like the\nL-particles 4-6, will be disposed to spin \u2018down.\u2019\nSimilarly, if the R-measurement occurs before the L-measurement, the\nguiding field and the position of the R-particle at the emission time\njointly determine the disposition of the R-particle to emerge either\nabove the z-axis (i.e., to z-spin \u2018up\u2019)\nor below the z-axis (i.e., to z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019) according to whether it is above or below the\ncenter plane, independently of the position of the L-particle along\nthe z-axis.\n\n\nBut the z-spin disposition of the R-particle changes\nimmediately after an (earlier) z-spin measurement on the\nL-particle: The R-particles 1-3 (see Fig. 4), which were previously\ndisposed to z-spin \u2018up,\u2019 will now be disposed to\nz-spin \u2018down,\u2019 i.e., to emerge below the center\nplane aligned orthogonally to the z-axis; and the R-particles\n4-6, which were previously disposed to z-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 will now be disposed to z-spin\n\u2018up,\u2019 i.e., to emerge above this center plane. Yet, the\nL-measurement per se does not have any immediate influence on\nthe state of the R-particle: The L-measurement does not influence the\nposition of the R-particle or any other property that is directly\nderived from this position. It only changes the guiding field, and\nthus grounds new spin dispositions for the R-particle. But these\ndispositions are not intrinsic properties of the R-particle. Rather,\nthey are relational properties of the R-particle, which are grounded\nin the positions of both particles and the state of the guiding\n field.[17] \n(Note that in the particular case in which the L-particle is emitted\nabove the center plane aligned orthogonally to the z-axis and\nthe R-particle is emitted below that plane, an earlier z-spin\non the L-particle will have no influence on the outcome of a\nz-spin on the R-particle.)\n\n\nWhile there is no contiguous process to carry the influence of the\nL-measurement outcome on events in the R-wing, the question of whether\nthis influence amounts to action at a distance depends on the exact\ncharacterization of this term. In contrast to the GRW/Pearle collapse\nmodels, the influence of the L-measurement outcome on the intrinsic\nproperties of the R-particle is dependent on the R-measurement: Before\nthis measurement occurs, there are no changes in the R-particle's\nintrinsic properties. Yet, the influence of the L-measurement on the\nR-particle is at a distance. Thus, the EPR/B experiment as depicted by\nthe minimal Bohm theory involves action* at a distance but not action\nat a distance. \n\n\nBohm's theory portrays the quantum realm as deterministic.  Thus, the\nsingle-case objective probabilities, i.e., the chances, it assigns to\nindividual spin-measurement outcomes in the EPR/B experiment are\ndifferent from the corresponding quantum-mechanical probabilities.  In\nparticular, while in quantum mechanics the chances of the outcomes\n\u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 in an earlier L- (R-) spin\nmeasurement are both \u00bd, in Bohm's theory these chances are\neither one or zero. Yet, Bohm's theory postulates a certain\ndistribution, the so-called \u2018quantum-equilibrium\ndistribution,\u2019 over all the possible positions of pairs with the\nsame guiding field. This distribution is computed from the\nquantum-mechanical wave function, and it is typically interpreted as\nignorance over the actual position of the pair; an ignorance that may\nbe motivated by dynamical considerations and statistical patterns\nexhibited by ensembles of pairs with the same wave function (for more\ndetails, see the entry on bohmian mechanics, section 9). And the\nsum-average (or more generally the integration) over this distribution\nreproduces all the quantum-mechanical observable predictions.\n\n\nWhat is the status of this probability postulate? Is it a law of\nnature or a contingent fact (if it is a fact at all)? The answers to\nthese questions vary (see Section 7.2.1, Bohm 1953, Valentini 1991a,b,\n1992, 1996, 2002, Valentini and Westman 2004, D\u00fcrr, Goldstein and\nZangh\u00ec 1992a,b, 1996, fn. 15, and Callender 2006).\n\n\nTurning to the question of non-separability, the minimal Bohm theory\ndoes not involve state non-separability. For recall that in this\ntheory the state of a system does not consist in its wave function,\nbut rather in the system's position, and the position of a composite\nsystem always factorizes into the positions of its subsystems. Here,\nthe non-separability of the wave function reflects the state of the\nguiding field. This state propagates not in ordinary three-space but\nin configuration space, where each point specifies the configuration\nof both particles. The guiding field of the particle pair cannot be\nfactorized into the guiding field that governs the trajectory of the\nL-particle and the guiding field that governs the trajectory of the\nR-particle. The evolution of the particles\u2019 trajectories,\nproperties and dispositions is non-separable, and accordingly the\nparticles\u2019 trajectories, properties and dispositions are\ncorrelated even when the particles are far away from each other and do\nnot interact with each other. Thus, process separability fails.\n\n\nIn the non-minimal Bohm\n theory[18],\n the behavior of an N-particle system is determined by its\nwave function and the intrinsic properties of the particles. But, in\ncontrast to the minimal theory, in the non-minimal theory spins are\nintrinsic properties of particles. The wave function always evolves\naccording to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and it is interpreted as a\n\u2018quantum field\u2019 (which has no sources or any dependence on\nthe particles). The quantum field guides the particles via the\n\u2018quantum potential,\u2019 an entity which is determined from\nthe quantum field, and the evolution of properties is fully\n deterministic.[19]\n\n\nLike in the minimal Bohm theory, the non-separability of the wave\nfunction in the EPR/B experiment dictates that the evolution of the\nparticles\u2019 trajectories, properties and dispositions is\nnon-separable, but the behavior of the particles is somewhat different.\nIn the earlier z-spin measurement on the L-particle, the\nquantum potential continuously changes, and this change induces an\nimmediate change in the z-spin of the R-particle. If the\nL-particle starts to spin \u2018up\u2019 (\u2018down\u2019) in the\nz-direction, the R-particle will start to spin\n\u2018down\u2019 (\u2018up\u2019) in the same direction (see the\nlittle arrows in Fig.\n 4).[20]\n Accordingly, the L-measurement induces instantaneous action at a\ndistance between the L- and the R-wing. Yet, similarly to the minimal\nBohm theory, while the disposition of the R-particle to emerge above\nor below the center plane aligned orthogonally to the\nz-direction in a z-spin measurement may change\ninstantaneously, the actual trajectory of the R-particle along the\nz-direction does not change before the measurement of the\nR-particle's z-spin occurs. Only during the R-measurement,\nthe spin and the position of the R-particle get correlated and the\nR-particle's trajectory along the z-direction is dictated by\nthe value of its (intrinsic) z-spin.\n\n\nVarious objections have been raised against Bohm's theory (for a\ndetailed list and replies, see the entry on Bohmian mechanics, section\n15). One main objection is that in Bohmian mechanics, the guiding\nfield influences the particles, but the particles do not influence the\nguiding field. Another common objection is that the theory is involved\nwith a radical type of non-locality, and that this type of\nnon-locality is incompatible with relativity. While it may be very\ndifficult, or even impossible, to reconcile Bohm's theory with\nrelativity, as is not difficult to see from the above discussion, the\ntype of non-locality that the minimal Bohm theory postulates in the\nEPR/B experiment does not seem more radical than the non-locality\npostulated by the orthodox interpretation and the GRW/Pearle collapse\nmodels.  \n5.3.2 Modal interpretations\n\n\nModal interpretations of quantum mechanics were designed to solve the\nmeasurement problem and to reconcile quantum mechanics with\nrelativity. They are no-collapse, (typically) indeterministic\nhidden-variables theories.  Quantum-mechanical states of systems\n(which may be construed as denoting their states or information about\nthese states) always evolve according to unitary and linear dynamical\nequations (the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the non-relativistic\ncase). And the orthodox quantum-mechanical state description of\nsystems is supplemented by a set of properties, which depends on the\nquantum-mechanical state and which is supposed to be rich enough to\naccount for the occurrence of definite macroscopic events and their\nclassical-like behavior, but sufficiently restricted to escape all the\nknown no-hidden-variables theorems. (For modal interpretations, see\nvan Fraassen 1973, 1981, 1991, chapter 9, Kochen 1985, Krips 1987,\nDieks 1988, 1989, Healey 1989, Bub 1992, 1994, 1997, Vermaas and Dieks\n1995, Clifton 1995, Bacciagaluppi 1996, Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo 1996,\nBub and Clifton 1996, Hemmo 1996b, Bacciagaluppi and Dickson 1999,\nClifton 2000, Spekkens and Sipe 2001a,b, Bene and Dieks 2002, and\nBerkovitz and Hemmo 2006a,b. For an entry-level review, see the entry\non modal interpretations of quantum theory. For comprehensive reviews\nand analyses of modal interpretations, see Bacciagaluppi 1996, Hemmo\n1996a, chapters 1-3, Dieks and Vermaas 1998, Vermaas 1999, and the\nentry on modal interpretations of quantum theory. For the\nno-hidden-variables theorems, see Kochen and Specker 1967,\nGreenberger, Horne and Zeilinger 1989, Mermin 1990 and the entry on\nthe Kochen-Specker \n theorem.)[21]\n\n\nModal interpretations vary in their property assignment. For\nsimplicity, we shall focus on modal interpretations in which the\nproperty assignment is based on the so-called Schmidt\nbiorthogonal-decomposition theorem (see Kochen 1985, Dieks 1989, and\nHealey 1989). Let S1 and S2 be\nsystems associated with the Hilbert spaces\nHS1 and\nHS2, respectively. There exist bases\n{|\u03b1i>} and\n{|\u03b2i>} for\nHS1 and\nHS2 respectively such that the state of\nS1+S2 can be expressed as a\nlinear combination of the following form of vectors from these\nbases:\n\n |\u03c88\n>S1+S2 =\n\u2211i ci\n|\u03b1i>S1 \n|\u03b2i>S2.\n\n\nWhen the absolute values of the coefficients ci\nare all unequal, the bases\n{|\u03b1i>} and\n{|\u03b2i>} and the above\ndecomposition of |\u03c88\n>S1+S2 are\nunique. In that case, it is postulated that S1 has\na determinate value for each observable associated with\nHS1 with the basis\n{|\u03b1i>} and\nS2 has a determinate value for each observable\nassociated with HS2 with the basis\n{|\u03b2i>}, and |ci|2\nprovide the (ignorance)\nprobabilities of the possible values that these observables may\n have.[22]\n For example, suppose that the state of the L- and the R-particle in\nthe EPR/B experiment before the measurements is:\n\n\n |\u03c89> = (1/\u221a2+\u03b5) \n|z-up>L|\nz-down>R \u2212 (1/\u221a2-\u03b5\u2032) \n|z-down>L|\nz-up>R \n\n\n\n\nwhere 1/\u221a2 >> \u03b5,\u03b5\u2032,\n(1/\u221a2+\u03b5)2+(1/\u221a2-\u03b5\u2032)2\n= 1, and (as before) |z-up>L\n(|z-up>R) and |\nz-down>L (|\nz-down>R) denote the states of the L- (R-)\nparticle having z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and z-spin \u2018down\u2019,\n respectively.[23]\n Then, either the L-particle spins \u2018up\u2019 and the R-particle\nspins \u2018down\u2019 in the z-direction, or the\nL-particle spins \u2018down\u2019 and the R-particle spins\n\u2018up\u2019 in the z-direction. Thus, in contrast to the\northodox interpretation and the GRW/Pearle collapse models, in modal\ninterpretations the particles in the EPR/B experiment may have\ndefinite spin properties even before any measurement occurs.\n\n\nTo see how the modal interpretation accounts for the curious\ncorrelations in EPR/B-type experiments, let us suppose that the state\nof the particle pair and the measurement apparatuses at the emission\ntime is:\n\n\n|\u03c810> = ((1/\u221a2+\u03b5)\n|z-up>L\n|z-down>R \u2212\n(1/\u221a2\u2212\u03b5\u2032)\n|z-down>L\n|z-up>R)\n|ready>AL|ready>AR\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere |ready>AL\n(|ready>AR) denotes the state of the\nL-apparatus (R-apparatus) being ready to measure z-spin. In\nthis state, the L- and the R-apparatus are in the definite state of\nbeing ready to measure z-spin, and (similarly to the state\n|\u03c89>) the L- and the R-particle have definite\nz-spin properties: Either the L-particle has z-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 and the R-particle has z-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 or the L-particle has z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 and the R-particle has z-spin\n \u2018up,\u2019[24] \n where the probability of the realization of each of these\npossibilities is approximately 1/2. In the (earlier) z-spin\nmeasurement on the L-particle, the state of the particle pair and the\napparatuses evolves to the state:\n\n\n |\u03c811> = ((1/\u221a2+\u03b5) \n|z-up>L|up>AL|\nz-down>R \u2212 (1/\u221a2-\u03b5\u2032) \n|z-down>L|down>AL|\nz-up>R) |ready>AR\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere (as before) |up>AL and\n|down>AL denote the states of the L-apparatus\npointing to the outcomes z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019, respectively. In this state,\neither the L-particle has a z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and the\nL-apparatus points to \u2018up,\u2019 or the L-particle has\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019 and the L-apparatus points to\n\u2018down.\u2019 And, again, the probability of each of these\npossibilities is approximately 1/2. The evolution of the properties\nfrom the state |\u03c810> to the state\n|\u03c811> depends on the dynamical laws. In almost all\nmodal interpretations, if the particles have definite z-spin\nproperties before the measurements, the outcomes of z-spin\nmeasurements will reflect these properties. That is, the evolution of\nthe properties of the particles and the measurement apparatuses will\nbe deterministic, so that the spin properties of the particles do not\nchange in the L-measurement and the pointer of the L-apparatus comes\nto display the outcome that corresponds to the z-spin\nproperty that the L-particle had before the measurement. If, for\nexample, before the measurements the L- and the R-particle have\nrespectively the properties z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019, the (earlier) z-spin\nmeasurement on the L-particle will yield the outcome \u2018up\u2019\nand the spin properties of the particles will remain\nunchanged. Accordingly, a z-spin measurement on the\nR-particle will yield the outcome \u2018down\u2019. Thus, in this\ncase the modal interpretation involves neither action at a distance\nnor action* at a distance.\n\n\nHowever, if the measurement apparatuses are set up to measure\nx-spin rather than z-spin, the evolution of the\nproperties of the L-particle and the L-apparatus will be\nindeterministic. As before, the L-measurement will not cause any change\nin the actual spin properties of the R-particle. But the L-measurement\noutcome will cause an instant change in the spin dispositions of the\nR-particle and the R-measurement apparatus. If, for example, the\nL-measurement outcome is x-spin \u2018up\u2019 and the\nL-particle comes to posses x-spin \u2018up,\u2019 then the\nR-particle and the R-apparatus will have respectively\nthe dispositions to possess x-spin \u2018down\u2019 and to\ndisplay the outcome x-spin \u2018down\u2019 on a\nx-spin measurement. Thus, like the minimal Bohm theory, the\nmodal interpretation may involve action* at a distance in the EPR/B\nexperiment. But, unlike the minimal Bohm theory, here spins are\nintrinsic properties of particles.\n\n\nIn the above modal interpretation, property composition fails: The\nproperties of composite systems are not decomposable into the\nproperties of their subsystems. Consider, again, the state\n|\u03c810>. As \u2018separated\u2019 systems (i.e.,  in\nthe decompositions of the composite system of the particle\npair+apparatuses into the L-particle and the R-particle+apparatuses\nand into the R-particle and the L-particle+apparatuses) the L- and the\nR-particle have definite z-spin properties. But, as\nsubsystems of the composite system of the particle pair (e.g. in the\ndecomposition of the composite system of the particle pair+apparatuses\ninto the particle pair and the apparatuses), they have no definite\nz-spin properties.\n\n\nA failure of property composition occurs also in the state \n|\u03c811>, where the L- and the R-particle have\ndefinite z-spin properties both as \u2018separated\u2019\nsystems and as subsystems of the particle pair (though in contrast with \n|\u03c810>, in |\u03c811> the range\nof the possible properties of the particles as separated systems and\nas subsystems of the pair is the same). For nothing in the above property\nassignment implies that in |\u03c811> the spin\nproperties that the L-particle has as a \u2018separated\u2019 system\nand the spin properties that it has as a subsystem of the particle pair\nbe the same: The L-particle may have z-spin \u2018up\u2019\nas a separated system and z-spin \u2018down\u2019 as a\nsubsystem of the particle pair.\n\n\nFurthermore, the dynamics of the properties that the L-particle\n(R-particle) has as a separated system and the dynamics of its\nproperties as a subsystem of the particle pair are generally\n different.[25]\n Consider, again, the state |\u03c810>. In the (earlier)\nz-spin measurement on the L-particle, the spin properties\nthat the L-particle has as a separated system follow a deterministic\nevolution \u2014 the L-particle has either z-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 or z-spin \u2018down\u2019 before and\nafter the L-measurement; whereas as a subsystem of the particle pair,\nthe spin properties of the L-particle follow an indeterministic\nevolution \u2014 the L-particle has no definite spin properties\nbefore the L-measurement and either z-spin \u2018up\u2019\n(with approximately chance \u00bd) or z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 (with approximately chance \u00bd) after the\nL-measurement.\n\n\nThe failure of property composition implies that the quantum realm as\ndepicted by the above version of the modal interpretation involves\nstate non-separability and property and relational holism. State\nseparability fails because the state of the particle pair is not\ngenerally determined by the separate states of the particles. Indeed,\nas is easily shown, the actual properties that the L- and the\nR-particle each has in the state |\u03c89> are also\ncompatible with product states in which the L- and the R-particle are\nnot entangled. Property and relational holism fail because in the\nstate |\u03c89> the properties of the pair do not\nsupervene upon the properties of its subsystems and the spatiotemporal\nrelations between them. Furthermore, process separability fails for\nsimilar reasons. \n\n\nThe failure of property composition in the modal interpretation\ncalls for explanation. It may be tempting to postulate that the\nproperties that a system (e.g. the L-particle) has, as a separated\nsystem, are the same as the properties that it has as a subsystem of\ncomposite systems. But, as Bacciagaluppi (1995) and Clifton (1996a)\nhave shown, such property assignment will be inconsistent: It will be\nsubject to a Kochen and Specker-type contradiction. Furthermore, as\nVermaas (1997) demonstrates, the properties of composite systems and\nthe properties of their subsystems cannot be correlated (in ways\ncompatible with the Born rule).\n\n\nFor what follows in the rest of this subsection, the views of\ndifferent authors differ widely. Several variants of modal\ninterpretations were developed in order to fix the problem of the\nfailure of property composition. The most natural explanation of the\nfailure of property composition is that quantum states assign\nrelational rather than intrinsic properties to systems (see Kochen\n1985, Bene and Dieks 2002, and Berkovitz and Hemmo 2006a,b). For\nexample, in the relational modal interpretation proposed by Berkovitz\nand Hemmo (2006a,b), the main idea is that quantum states assign\nproperties to systems only relative to other systems, and properties\nof a system that are related to different systems are generally\ndifferent. In particular, in the state |\u03c810> the\nL-particle has a definite z-spin property relative to the\nR-particle, the measurement apparatuses and the rest of the universe,\nbut (as a subsystem of the particle pair) it has no definite\nz-spin relative to the measurement apparatuses and the rest\nof\n universe.[26]\n On this interpretation, the properties of systems are highly\nnon-local by their very nature.  Properties like pointing to\n\u2018up\u2019 and pointing to \u2018down\u2019 are not intrinsic\nto the measurement apparatuses.  Rather, they are relations between\nthe apparatuses and other systems.  For example, the property of the\nL-apparatus pointing to \u2018up\u2019 relative to the particle\npair, the R-apparatus and the rest of the universe is not intrinsic to\nthe L-apparatus; it is a relation between the L-apparatus and the\nparticle pair, the R-apparatus and the rest of the universe. As such,\nthis property is highly non-local: It is located in neither the L-wing\nnor any other subregion of the universe. Yet, due to the dynamical\nlaws, properties like the position of pointers of measurement\napparatuses, which appear to us to be local, behave like local\nproperties in any experimental circumstances, and accordingly this\nradical type of non-locality is unobservable (for more details, see\nBerkovitz and Hemmo 2006b, sections 8.1 and 9).\n\n\nAnother way to try to explain the failure of property composition is\nto interpret the properties of composite systems as holistic,\nnon-decomposable properties. On this interpretation, the\nz-spin \u2018up\u2019 property that the L-particle has as a\nsubsystem of the particle pair in the state |\u03c89> is\ncompletely different from the z-spin \u2018up\u2019\nproperty that the L-particle has as a separated system, and the use of\nthe term \u2018z-spin up\u2019 in both cases is misleading\n(for more details, see Berkovitz and Hemmo \n 2006a).[27]\n\n\nThe relational and holistic interpretations of properties mark a\nradical shift from the standard interpretation of properties in\northodox quantum mechanics. Other advocates of the modal interpretation\nhave chosen not to follow this interpretation, and opted for a modal\ninterpretation that does not violate property composition. While the\nproperty assignment above does not assume any preferred partition of\nthe universe (the partition of the universe into a particle pair and\nthe rest of the universe is as good as the partition of the universe\ninto the L-particle and the rest of the universe), proponents of\nproperty composition postulated that there is a preferred partition of\nthe universe into \u2018atomic\u2019 systems and accordingly a\npreferred factorization of the Hilbert space of the universe. This\npreferred factorization is supposed to be the basis for the\n\u2018core\u2019 property assignment: Properties are prescribed to\natomic systems according to a property assignment that is a\ngeneralization of the bi-orthogonal decomposition property\n assignment.[28]\n And the properties of complex systems are postulated to be\ncompositions of the properties of their atomic systems (see the entry\non modal interpretations of quantum theory, section 2, and\nBacciagaluppi and Dickson 1999). The challenge for this atomic modal\ninterpretation is to justify the assumption that there is a preferred\npartition of the universe, and to provide some idea about how such\nfactorization should look like.\n\n\nFinally, while the modal interpretation was designed to solve the\nmeasurement problem and reconcile quantum mechanics with special\nrelativity, it faces challenges on both accounts.  First, in certain\nimprefect measurements (where there are imprefections in the coupling\nbetween the measured system and the pointer of the measurement\napparatus and/or the pointer and the environment), modal\ninterpretations that are based on the Schmidt\nbiorthogonal-decomposition theorem (and more generally the spectral\ndecomposition theorem) fail to account for definite measurement\noutcomes, in contradiction to our experience (see Bacciagaluppi and\nHemmo 1996 and Bacciagaluppi 2000). For versions of the modal\ninterpretations that seem to escape this problem, see Van Fraassen\n(1973, 1991), Bub (1992, 1997), Bene and Dieks (2002) and Berkovitz\nand Hemmo (2006a,b). Second, as we shall see in section 10.2, a number\nof no-go theorems challenge the view that modal interpretations could\nbe genuinely relativistic.\n5.3.3 Everett-like interpretations\n\n\nIn 1957, Everett proposed a new no-collapse interpretation of orthodox\nquantum mechanics (see Everett 1957a,b, 1973, Barrett 1999, the entry\non Everett's relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics, the\nentry on the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and\nreferences therein). The Everett interpretation is a no-collapse\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, where the evolution of quantum\nstates is always according to unitary and linear dynamical equations\n(the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the non-relativistic case). In this\ninterpretation, quantum states are fundamentally relative. Systems have\nrelative states, which are derivable from the various branches of the\nentangled states. For example, consider again |\u03c811>. \n\n\n |\u03c811> = (1/\u221a2+\u03b5) \n|z-up>L|up>AL|\nz-down>R |ready>AR\n\u2212 (1/\u221a2-\u03b5\u2032) \n|z-down>L|down>AL|\nz-up>R |ready>AR.\n \n\n\n\n\nIn this quantum-mechanical state, the L-apparatus is in the state of\npointing to the outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019\nrelative to the L-particle being in the state z-spin\n\u2018up,\u2019 the R-particle being in the state z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 and the R-apparatus being ready to measure\nz-spin; and in the state of pointing to the outcome\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019 relative to the L-particle\nbeing in the state z-spin \u2018down,\u2019 the R-particle\nbeing in the state z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and the\nR-apparatus being ready to measure z-spin. Likewise, the\nL-particle is in the state z-spin \u2018up\u2019 relative\nto the L-apparatus being in the state of pointing to the outcome\nz-spin \u2018up,\u2019 the R-particle being in the state\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019 and the R-apparatus being ready to\nmeasure z-spin; and in the state z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 relative to the L-apparatus being in the state of\npointing to the outcome z-spin \u2018down,\u2019 the\nR-particle being in the state z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and the\nR-apparatus being ready to measure z-spin. And similarly,\nmutatis mutandis, for the relative state of the R-particle\nand the R-apparatus.\n\n\nEverett's original formulation left the exact meaning of these\nrelative states and their relations to observers\u2019 experience and\nbeliefs open, and there have been different Everett-like\ninterpretations of these states. Probably the most popular reading of\nEverett is the splitting-worlds interpretation (see DeWitt 1971,\nEverett's relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics, Barrett\n1999, and references therein). In the splitting-worlds interpretation,\neach of the branches of the state |\u03c811> refers to a\ndifferent class of worlds (all of which are real) where the states of\nthe L-apparatus, R-apparatus and the particles are all separable:\nClass-1 worlds in which the L-particle is in the state z-spin\n\u2018up,\u2019 the R-particle is in the state z-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 the L-apparatus is in the state of pointing to the\noutcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and the R-apparatus in the\nstate of being ready to measure z-spin; and class-2 worlds in\nwhich the L-particle is in the state z-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 the R-particle is in the state z-spin\n\u2018up,\u2019 the L-apparatus is in the state of pointing to the\noutcome z-spin \u2018down\u2019 and the R-apparatus is in\nthe state of being ready to measure z-spin. More generally,\neach term in state of the universe, as represented in a certain\npreferred basis, reflects the states of its systems in some class of\nworlds; where the range of the different classes of worlds increases\nwhenever the number of the terms in the quantum state (in the\npreferred basis) increases (this process is called\n\u2018splitting\u2019).\n\n\nThe splitting-worlds reading of Everett faces a number of challenges.\nFirst, supporters of the Everett interpretation frequently motivate\ntheir interpretation by arguing that it postulates the existence of\nneither a controversial wave collapse nor hidden variables, and it\nleaves the simple and elegant mathematical structure of quantum\nmechanics intact. But, the splitting-worlds interpretation adds extra\nstructure to no-collapse orthodox quantum mechanics. Further, this\ninterpretation marks a radical shift from orthodox quantum\nmechanics. A scientific theory is not constituted only by its\nmathematical formalism, but also by the ontology it postulates, the\nway it depicts the physical realm and the way it accounts for our\nexperience. The many parallel worlds ontology of the splitting-worlds\ninterpretation and its account of our experience are radically\ndifferent from the ontology of the intended interpretation of orthodox\nquantum mechanics and its account for our experience. Second, relative\nstates are well defined in any basis, and the question arises as to\nwhich basis should be preferred and the motivation for selecting one\nparticular basis over others.  Third, in the splitting-worlds\ninterpretation each of the worlds in the universe may split into two\nor more worlds, and the problem is that (similarly to the collapse in\northodox collapse quantum mechanics) there are no clear criteria for\nwhen a splitting occurs and how long it takes. Fourth, there is the\nquestion of how the splitting-worlds interpretation accounts for the\nstatistical predictions of the orthodox theory. In the Everett-like\ninterpretations in general, and in the splitting-worlds interpretation\nin particular, all the possible measurement outcomes in the EPR/B\nexperiment are realized and may be observed.  Thus, the question\narises as to the meaning of probabilities in this interpretation. For\nexample, what is the meaning of the statement that in the state\n|\u03c810> (see section 5.3.2) the probability of the\nL-measurement apparatus pointing to the outcome \u2018up\u2019 in an\nearlier z-spin measurement on the L-particle is\n(approximately) \u00bd? In the splitting-worlds interpretation the\nprobability of that outcome appears to be 1! Furthermore, setting\naside the problem of interpretation, there is also the question of\nwhether the splitting-worlds interpretation, and more generally\nEverett-like interpretations, can account for the particular values of\nthe quantum probabilities of measurement outcomes. Everett claimed to\nderive the Born probabilities in the context of his\ninterpretation. But this derivation has been controversial. (For\ndiscussions of the meaning of probabilities, or more precisely the\nmeaning of the coefficients of the various terms in quantum states, in\nEverett-like interpretations, see Butterfield 1996, Lockwood 1996a,b,\nSaunders 1998, Vaidman 1998, Barnum et al. 2000, Bacciagaluppi 2002,\nGill 2003, Hemmo and Pitowsky 2003, 2005, Wallace 2002, 2003, 2005a,b,\nGreaves 2004 and Saunders 2004, 2005.) \n\n\nOther readings of Everett include the many-minds interpretation\n(Albert and Loewer 1988, Barrett 1999, chapter 7), the\nconsistent-histories approach (Gell-Mann and Hartle 1990), the\nEverett-like relational interpretation (Saunders 1995, Mermin 1998)\nand (what may be called) the many-structures interpretation (Wallace\n2005c). While these readings address more or less successfully the\nproblems of the preferred basis and splitting, except for the\nmany-minds interpretation of Albert and Loewer the question of whether\nthere could be a satisfactory interpretation of probabilities in the\ncontext of these theories and the adequacy of the derivation of the\nBorn probabilities are still a controversial issue (see Deutsch 1999,\nWallace 2002, 2003, Lewis 2003, Graves 2004, Saunders 2004, Hemmo and\nPitowsky 2005, and Price 2006).\n\n\nWhat kind of non-locality do Everett-like interpretations involve?\nUnfortunately, the answer to this question is not straightforward, as\nit depends on one's particular reading of the Everett\ninterpretation. Indeed, all the above readings of Everett seem to treat\nthe no-collapse wave function of the universe as a real physical entity\nthat reflects the non-separable state of the universe, and accordingly\nthey involve state non-separability. But, one may reasonably expect\nthat different readings depict different pictures of physical reality\nand accordingly might postulate different kinds of non-locality. Thus,\nany further analysis of the type of non-locality postulated by each of\nthese readings requires a detailed study of their ontology (which we\nplan to conduct in future updates of this entry).\n\n\nFor example, the question of action at a distance in the EPR/B\nexperiment may arise in the context of the splitting-worlds interpretation,\nbut not in the context of Albert and Loewer's many-minds\ninterpretation. Albert and Loewer's interpretation takes the bare\nno-collapse orthodox quantum mechanics to be the complete theory of the\nphysical realm. Accordingly, the L-apparatus in the state \n|\u03c811> does not display any definite outcome. Yet,\nin order to account for our experience of a classical-like world, where\nat the end of measurements observers are typically in mental states of\nperceiving definite outcomes, the many-minds interpretation appeals to\na dualism of mind-body. Each observer is associated with a continuous\ninfinity of non-physical minds. And while the physical state of the\nworld evolves in a completely deterministic manner according to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger evolution, and the pointers of the measurement\napparatuses in the EPR/B experiment display no definite outcomes,\nstates of minds evolve in a genuinely indeterministic fashion so as to\nyield an experience of perceiving definite measurement outcomes. For\nexample, consider again, the state |\u03c810>. While\nin a first z-spin L-measurement, this state evolves\ndeterministically into the state |\u03c811>, minds of\nobservers evolve indeterministically into either the state of\nperceiving the outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019 or the state of\nperceiving the outcome z-spin \u2018down\u2019 with the\nusual Born-rule probabilities (approximately 50% chance for each of\nthese outcomes). Since in this state the L-particle has no definite\nspin properties and the L-apparatus points to no definite measurement\noutcome, and since in the later z-spin measurement on the\nR-particle the R-particle does not come to possess any definite spin\nproperties and the R-apparatus points to no definite spin outcome, the\nquestion of whether there is action at a distance between the L-particle and the\nL-apparatus on the one hand and the R-particle and the R-apparatus on\nthe other does not arise.\n6. Superluminal causation\n\n\nIn all the above interpretations of quantum mechanics, the failure of\nfactorizability (i.e., the failure of the joint probability of the\nmeasurement outcomes in the EPR/B experiment to factorize into their\nsingle probabilities) involves non-separability, holism and/or some\ntype of action at a distance. As we shall see below,\nnon-factorizability also implies superluminal causal dependence\naccording to certain accounts of causation.\n\n\nFirst, as is not difficult to show, the failure of factorizability\nimplies superluminal causation according to various probabilistic\naccounts of causation that satisfy Reichenbach's (1956, section 19)\nprinciple of the common cause (for a review of this principle, see the\nentry on Reichenbach's principle of the common cause).\n\n\nHere is why. Reichenbach's principle may be formulated as follows:\n\n\nPCC (Principle of the Common Cause). For any\ncorrelation between two (distinct) events which do not cause each\nother, there is a common cause that screens them off from each other.\nOr formally: If distinct events x and y are\ncorrelated, i.e.,\n\n (Correlation) \nP(x & y) \n\u2260 P(x) \u00b7 P(y),\n \n\n\nand they do not cause each other, then their common cause,\nCC(x,y), screens them off from each other, i.e.,\n\n(Screening Off) \n\n\nPCC(x,y)(x/y) =\nPCC(x,y)(x)\nPCC(x,y)(y)\n \u2260 0\n\n\nPCC(x,y)(y/x) =\nPCC(x,y)(y)\nPCC(x,y)(x) \u2260 \n 0.[29]\n\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly, CC(x,y) renders x and\ny probabilistically independent, and the joint probability of\nx and y factorizes upon\nCC(x,y):\n\nPCC(x,y)(x & y) =\nPCC(x,y)(x) \u00b7\nPCC(x,y)(y).\n  \n\n\n\nThe above formulation of PCC is mainly intended to cover cases in\nwhich x and y have no partial, non-common causes. But\nPCC can be generalized as follows:\n\n\nPCC*. The joint probability of any distinct,\ncorrelated events, x and y, which are not causally\nconnected to each other, factorizes upon the union of their partial\n(separate) causes and their common cause. That is, let\nCC(x,y) denote the common causes of\nx and y, and PC(x) and\nPC(y) denote respectively their partial causes. Then,\nthe joint probability of x and y factorizes\nupon the Union of their Causal Pasts (henceforth, FactorUCP),\ni.e., on the union of PC(x), PC(y)\nand CC(x,y):\n\n\nFactorUCP \nPPC(x) PC(y)\n CC(x,y)\n (x & y) =\nPPC(x)\n CC(x,y) (x) \u00b7\nPPC(y) \nCC(x,y) (y).\n\n\n\n\n\nLike PCC, the basic idea of FactorUCP is that the objective\nprobabilities of events that do not cause each other are determined by\ntheir causal pasts, and given these causal pasts they are\nprobabilistically independent of each other. As is not difficult to\nsee, factorizability is a special case of FactorUCP. That is, to obtain\nfactorizability from FactorUCP, substitute \u03bb for\nCC(x,y), l for\nPC(x) and r for\nPC(y). FactorUCP and the assumption that the\nprobabilities of the measurement-outcomes in the EPR/B experiment are\ndetermined by the pair's state and the settings of the\nmeasurement apparatuses jointly imply factorizability. Thus, given this\nlater assumption, the failure of factorizability implies superluminal\ncausation between the distant outcomes in the EPR/B experiment\naccording to any account of causation that satisfies FactorUCP (for\nsome examples of such accounts, see Butterfield 1989 and Berkovitz\n1995a, 1995b, section 6.7, \n 1998b).[30]\n\n\nSuperluminal causation between the distant outcomes also exists\naccording to various counterfactual accounts of causation, including\naccounts that do not satisfy FactorUCP. In particular, in Lewis's\n(1986) influential account, counterfactual dependence between distinct\nevents implies causal dependence between them. And as Butterfield\n(1992b) and Berkovitz (1998b) demonstrate, the violation of\nFactorizability involves a counterfactual dependence between the\ndistant measurement outcomes in the EPR/B experiment.\n\n\nBut the violation of factorizability does not imply superluminal\ncausation according to some other accounts of causation. In\nparticular, in process accounts of causation there is no superluminal\ncausation in the EPR/B experiment. In such accounts, causal dependence\nbetween events is explicated in terms of continuous processes in space\nand time that transmit \u2018marks\u2019 or conserved quantities\nfrom the cause to the effect (see Salmon 1998, chapters 1, 12, 16 and\n18, Dowe 2000, the entry on causal processes, and references\ntherein). Thus, recalling (sections 1, 2, 4 and 5) that none of the\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics and alternative quantum theories\npostulates any (direct) continuous process between the distant\nmeasurement events in the EPR/B experiment, there is no superluminal\ncausation between them according to process accounts of causation.\n7. Superluminal signaling\n\n\nWhether or not the non-locality predicted by quantum theories may be\nclassified as action at a distance or superluminal causation, the\nquestion arises as to whether this non-locality could be exploited to\nallow superluminal (i.e., faster-than-light) signaling of information.\nThis question is of particular importance for those who interpret\nrelativity as prohibiting any such superluminal signaling. (We shall\nreturn to discuss this interpretation in section 10.)\n\n\nSuperluminal signaling would require that the state of nearby\ncontrollable physical objects (say, a keyboard in my computer)\nsuperluminally influence distant observable physical phenomena (e.g. a\npattern on a computer screen light years away). The influence may be\ndeterministic or indeterministic, but in any case it should cause a\ndetectable change in the statistics of some distant physical\nquantities.\n\n\nIt is commonly agreed that in quantum phenomena, superluminal\nsignaling is impossible in practice. Moreover, many believe that such\nsignaling is excluded in principle by the so-called \u2018no-signaling\ntheorem\u2019 (for proofs of this theorem, see Eberhard 1978,\nGhirardi, Rimini and Weber 1980, Jordan 1983, Shimony 1984, Redhead\n1987, pp. 113-116 and 118). It is thus frequently claimed with respect\nto EPR/B experiments that there is no such thing as a Bell telephone,\nnamely a telephone that could exploit the violation of the Bell\ninequalities for superluminal signaling of\n information.[31]\n\n\nThe no-signaling theorem demonstrates that orthodox quantum\nmechanics excludes any possibility of superluminal signaling in the\nEPR/B experiment. According to this theory, no controllable physical\nfactor in the L-wing, such as the setting of the L-measurement\napparatus, can take advantage of the entanglement between the systems\nin the L- and the R-wing to influence the statistics of the measurement\noutcomes (or any other observable) in the R-wing. As we have seen in\nsection 5.1.1, the orthodox theory is at best incomplete. Thus, the\nfact that it excludes superluminal signaling does not imply that other\nquantum theories or interpretations of the orthodox theory also exclude\nsuch signaling. Yet, if the orthodox theory is empirically adequate, as\nthe consensus has it, its statistical predictions obtain, and\naccordingly superluminal signaling will be excluded as a matter of\nfact; for if this theory is empirically adequate, any quantum theory\nwill have to reproduce its statistics, including the exclusion of any\nactual superluminal signaling.\n\n\nBut the no-signaling theorem does not demonstrate that superluminal\nsignaling would be impossible if orthodox quantum mechanics were not\nempirically adequate. Furthermore, this theorem does not show that\nsuperluminal signaling is in principle impossible in the quantum realm\nas depicted by other theories, which actually reproduce the\nstatistics of orthodox quantum mechanics but do not prohibit in theory\nthe violation of this statistics. In sections 7.2-7.3, we shall\nconsider the in-principle possibility of superluminal signaling in\ncertain collapse and no-collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics.\nBut, first, we need to consider the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor superluminal signaling.\n7.1 Necessary and sufficient conditions for superluminal signaling\n\n\nTo simplify things, in our discussion we shall focus on\nnon-factorizable models of the EPR/B experiment that satisfy\n\u03bb-independence (i.e., the assumption that the distribution of\nthe states \u03bb is independent of the settings of the measurement\napparatuses). Superluminal signaling in the EPR/B experiment would be\npossible in theory just in case the value of some controllable\nphysical quantity in the nearby wing could influence the statistics of\nmeasurement outcomes in the distant wing. And in non-factorizable\nmodels that satisfy \u03bb-independence this could happen just in\ncase the following conditions obtained:\n\nControllable probabilistic dependence. The\nprobabilities of distant measurement outcomes depend on some nearby\ncontrollable physical quantity. \n \n\n\u03bb-distribution. There can be in theory an ensemble of particle pairs the states of which deviate from the quantum-equilibrium distribution; where the quantum-equilibrium distribution of pairs' states is the distribution that reproduces the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics.\n\n\nFour comments: (i) In controllable probabilistic dependence, the term\n'probabilities of measurement outcomes' refers to the model\nprobabilities, i.e., the probabilities that the states \u03bb\nprescribe for measurement outcomes. \n\n \n\n(ii) Our discussion in this entry focuses on models of the EPR/B\nexperiment in which probabilities of measurement outcomes depend only\non the pair's state \u03bb and the settings of the measurement\napparatuses to measure certain properties. In such models, parameter\ndependence (i.e., the dependence of the probability of the distant\nmeasurement outcome on the setting of the nearby measurement\napparatus) is a necessary and sufficient condition for controllable\nprobabilistic dependence. But, recall (footnote 3) that in some models\nof the EPR/B experiment, in addition to the pair's state and the\nsetting of the L- (R-) measurement apparatus there are other local\nphysical quantities that may be relevant for the probability of the L-\n(R-) measurement outcome. In such models, parameter dependence is not\na necessary condition for controllable probabilistic dependence. Some\nother physical quantities in the nearby wing may be relevant for the\nprobability of the distant measurement outcome. (That is, let \u03b1\nand \u03b2 denote all the relevant local physical quantities, other\nthan the settings of the measurement apparatuses, that may be relevant\nfor the probability of the L- and the R-outcome, respectively. Then,\ncontrollable probabilistic dependence would obtain if for some pairs'\nstates \u03bb, L-setting l, R-setting r and local\nphysical quantities \u03b1 and \u03b2, P\u03bb\nl r \u03b1 \u03b2(yr) \u2260\nP\u03bb l r\n\u03b2(yr) obtained.) For the relevance\nof such models to the question of the in-principle possibility of\nsuperluminal signalling in some current interpretations of quantum\nmechanics, see sections 7.3 and 7.4. \n\n \n\n(iii) The quantum-equilibrium distribution will not be the same in all\nmodels of the EPR/B experiment; for in general the states \u03bb\nwill not be the same in different models. \n\n \n\n(iv) In models that actually violate both controllable probabilistic\ndependence and \u03bb-distribution, the occurrence of controllable\nprobabilistic dependence would render the actual distribution of\n\u03bb states as non-equilbrium distribution. Thus, if controllable\nprobabilistic dependence occurred in such models, the actual\ndistribution of \u03bb states would satisfy\n\u03bb-distribution. \n\n\nThe argument for the necessity of controllable probabilistic\ndependence and \u03bb-distribution is straightforward. Granted\n\u03bb-independence, if the probabilistic dependence of the distant\noutcome on a nearby physical quantity is not controllable, there can\nbe no way to manipulate the statistics of the distant outcome so as to\ndeviate from the statistical predictions of quantum\nmechanics. Accordingly, superluminal transmission of information will\nbe impossible even in theory. And if \u03bb-distribution does not\nhold, i.e., if the quantum-equilibrium distribution holds, controllable\nprobabilistic dependence will be of no use for superluminal\ntransmission of information. For, averaging over the model\nprobabilities according to the quantum-equilbrium distribution, the\nmodel will reproduce the statistics of orthodox quantum\nmechanics. That is, the distribution of the \u03bb-states will be\nsuch that the probabilistic dependence of the distant outcome on the\nnearby controllable factor will be washed out: In some states the\nnearby controllable factor will raise the probability of the distant\noutcome and in others it will decrease this probability, so that on\naverage the overall statistics of the distant outcome will be\nindependent of the nearby controllable factor (i.e., the same as the\nstatistics of orthodox quantum mechanics). Accordingly, superluminal\nsignaling will be impossible.\n\n\nThe argument for the sufficiency of these conditions is also\nstraightforward. If \u03bb-distribution held, it would be possible\nin theory to arrange ensembles of particle pairs in which controllable\nprobabilistic dependence would not be washed out, and accordingly the\nstatistics of distant outcomes would depend on the nearby controllable\nfactor. (For a proof that these conditions are sufficient for\nsuperluminal signaling in certain deterministic hidden variables\ntheories, see Valentini 2002.)\n\n\nNote that the necessary and sufficient conditions for superluminal\nsignaling are different in models that do not exclude in theory the\nviolation of \u03bb-independence. In such models controllable\nprobabilistic dependence is not a necessary condition for superluminal\nsignaling. The reasoning is as follows. Consider any empirically\nadequate model of the EPR/B experiment in which the pair's state and\nthe settings of the measurement apparatuses are the only relevant\nfactors for the probabilities of measurement outcomes, and the\nquantum-equilibrium distribution is \u03bb-independent. In such a\nmodel, parameter independence implies the failure of controllable\nprobabilistic dependence, yet the violation of \u03bb-independence\nwould imply the possibility of superluminal signaling: If\n\u03bb-independence failed, a change in the setting of the nearby\nmeasurement apparatus would cause a change in the distribution of the\nstates \u03bb, and a change in this distribution would induce a\nchange in the statistics of the distant (space-like separated)\nmeasurement outcome. \n\n\nLeaving aside models that violate \u03bb-independence, we now turn\nto consider the prospects of controllable probabilistic dependence and\n\u03bb-distribution, starting with no-collapse interpretations.\n7.2 No-collapse theories\n7.2.1 Bohm's Theory\n\n\nBohm's theory involves parameter dependence and thus controllable\nprobabilistic dependence: The probabilities of distant outcomes depend\non the setting of the nearby apparatus. In some pairs' states\n\u03bb, i.e., in some configurations of the positions of the particle\npair, a change in the apparatus setting of the (earlier) say\nL-measurement will induce an immediate change in the probability of\nthe R-outcome: e.g. the probability of R-outcome\nz-spin \u2018up\u2019 will be 1 if the L-apparatus is set\nto measure z-spin and 0 if the L-apparatus is switched off\n(see section 5.3.1). Thus, the question of superluminal signaling\nturns on whether \u03bb-distribution obtains.\n\n\nNow, recall (section 5.3.1) that Bohm's theory reproduces the quantum\nstatistics by postulating the quantum-equilibrium distribution over\nthe positions of particles. If this distribution is not an accidental\nfact about our universe, but rather obtains as a matter of law,\nsuperluminal signaling will be impossible in principle. D\u00fcrr,\nGoldstein and Zangh\u00ec (1992a,b, 1996, fn. 15) argue that, while\nthe quantum-equilibrium distribution is not a matter a law, other\ndistributions will be possible but atypical. Thus, they conclude that\nalthough superluminal signaling is not impossible in theory, it may\noccur only in atypical worlds. On the other hand, Valentini (1991a,b,\n1992, 1996, 2002) and Valentini and Westman 2004) argue that there are\ngood reasons to think that our universe may well have started off in a\nstate of quantum non-equilibrium and is now approaching gradually a\nstate of equilibrium, so that even today some residual non-equilibrium\nmust be\n present.[32] \n Yet, even if such residual non-equilbrium existed, the question is\nwhether it would be possible to access any ensemble of systems in a\nnon-equilbrium distribution.  \n7.2.2 Modal interpretations\n\n\nThe presence or absence of parameter independence (and accordingly the\npresence or absence of controllable probabilistic dependence) in the\nmodal interprtation is a matter of controversy, perhaps due in part to\nthe multiplicity of versions of this interpretation. Whether or not\nmodal interpretations involve parameter dependence would probably\ndepend on the dynamics of the possessed properties. At least some of\nthe current modal interpretations seem to involve no parameter\ndependence. But, as the subject editor pointed out to the author, some\nthink that the no-go theorem for relativistic modal interpretation due\nto Dickson and Clifton (1998) implies the existence of parameter\ndependence in all the interpretations to which this theorem is\napplicable. Do modal interpretations satisfy \u03bb-distribution?\nThe prospects of this condition depend on whether the possessed\nproperties that the modal interpretation assigns in addition to the\nproperties prescribed by the orthodox interpretation, are\ncontrollable. If these properties were controllable at least in\ntheory, \u03bb-distribution would be possible. For example, if the\npossessed spin properties that the particles have at the emission from\nthe source in the EPR/B experiment were controllable, then\n\u03bb-distribution would be possible. The common view seems to be\nthat these properties are uncontrollable. \n7.3 Collapse theories\n7.3.1 Dynamical models for state-vector reduction\n\n\nIn the GRW/Pearle collapse models, wave functions represent the most\nexhaustive, complete specification of states of individual\nsystems. Thus, pairs prepared with the same wave function have always\nthe same \u03bb state \u2014 a state that represents their\nquantum-equilbrium distribution for the EPR/B experiment. Accordingly,\n\u03bb-distribution fails. Do these models involve controllable\nprobabilistic dependence?\n\n\nRecall (section 5.1.2) that there are several models of state\nreduction in the literature. One of these models is the so-called\nnon-linear Continuous Stochastic Localization (CSL) models (see Pearle\n1989, Ghirardi, Pearle and Rimini 1990, Butterfield et al. 1993, and\nGhirardi et al. 1993). Butterfield et al. (1993) argue that in these\nmodels there is a probabilistic dependence of the outcome of the\nR-measurement on the process that leads to the (earlier) outcome of\nthe L-measurement. In these models, the process leading to the\nL-outcome (either z-spin \u2018up\u2019 or z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019) depends on the interaction between the L-particle\nand the L-apparatus (which results in an entangled state), and the\nspecific realization of the stochastic process that strives to\ncollapse this macroscopic superposition into a product state in which\nthe L-apparatus displays a definite outcome. And the probability of\nthe R-outcome depends on this process. For example, if this process is\none that gives rise to a z-spin \u2018up\u2019 (or renders\nthat outcome more likely), the probability of R-outcome\nz-spin \u2018up\u2019 is 0 (more likely to be 0); and if\nthis process is one that gives rise to a z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 (or renders that outcome more likely), the\nprobability of R-outcome z-spin \u2018down\u2019 is 0 (more\nlikely to be 0). The question is whether there are controllable\nfactors that influence the probability of realizations of stochastic\nprocesses that lead to a specific L-outcome, so that it would be\npossible to increase or decrease the probability of the R-outcome. If\nsuch factors existed, controllable probabilistic dependence would be\npossible at least in theory. And if this kind of controllable\nprobabilistic dependence existed, \u03bb-distribution would also\nobtain; for if such dependence existed, the actual distribution of\npairs' states (in which the pair always have the same state, the\nquantum-mechanical state) would cease to be the quantum-equilbrium\ndistribution.\n7.4 The prospects of controllable probabilistic dependence\n\n\nIn section 7.3.1, we discussed the question of the in-principle\ncontrollability of local measurement processes and in particular the\nprobability of their outcome, and the implications of such\ncontrollability for the in-principle possibility of superluminal\nsignaling in the context of the CSL models. But this question is not\nspecific to the CSL model and (more generally) the dynamical models\nfor state-vector reduction. It seems likely to arise also in other\nquantum theories that model measurements realistically. Here is\nwhy. Real measurements take time. And during that time, some physical\nvariable, other than the state of the measured system and the setting\nof the measurement apparatus, might influence the chance (i.e., the\nsingle-case objective probability) of the measurement outcome. In\nparticular, during the L-measurement in the EPR/B experiment, the\nchance of the L-outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019\n(\u2018down\u2019) might depend on the value of some physical\nvariable in the L-wing, other than the state of the particle pair and\nthe setting of the L-measurement apparatus. If so, it will follow from\nthe familiar perfect anti-correlation of the singlet state that the\nchance of R-outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019\n(\u2018down\u2019) will depend on the value of such variable (for\ndetails, see Kronz 1990a,b, Jones and Clifton 1993, pp. 304-305, and\nBerkovitz 1998a, section 4.3.4). Thus, if the value of such a variable\nwere controllable, controllable probabilistic dependence would\nobtain.\n7.5 Superluminal signaling and action-at-a-distance\n\n\nIf superluminal signaling were possible in the EPR/B experiment in any\nof the above theories, it would not require any continuous process in\nspacetime to mediate the influences between the two distant\nwings. Indeed, in all the current quantum theories in which the\nprobability of the R-outcome depends on some controllable physical\nvariable in the L-wing, this dependence is not due to a continuous\nprocess. Rather, it is due to some type of \u2018action\u2019 or (to\nuse Shimony's (1984) terminology) \u2018passion\u2019 at a distance,\nwhich is the \u2018result\u2019 of the holistic nature of the\nquantum realm, the non-separability of the state of entangled systems,\nor the non-separable nature of the evolution of the properties of\nsystems. \n8. The analysis of factorizability: implications for quantum non-locality\n\n\nIn sections 5-7, we considered the nature of quantum non-locality as\ndepicted by theories that violate factorizability, i.e., the assumption\nthat the probability of joint measurement outcomes factorizes into the\nsingle probabilities of these outcomes. Recalling section 3,\nfactorizability can be analyzed into a conjunction of two conditions:\nOI (outcome independence)\u2014the probability of a distant\nmeasurement outcome in the EPR/B experiment is independent of the\nnearby measurement outcome; and PI (parameter independence)\u2014the\nprobability of a distant measurement outcome in the EPR/B experiment\nis independent of the setting of the nearby measurement\napparatus. Bohm's theory violates PI, whereas other mainstream quantum\ntheories satisfy this condition but violate OI. The question arises as\nto whether violations of PI involve a different kind of non-locality\nthan violations of OI.  So far, our methodology was to study the\nnature of quantum non-locality by analyzing the way various quantum\ntheories account for the curious correlations in the EPR/B\nexperiment. In this section, we shall focus on the question of whether\nquantum non-locality can be studied in a more general way, namely by\nanalyzing the types of non-locality involved in violations of PI and\nin violations of OI, independently of how these violations are\nrealized.\n8.1 Non-separability, holism and action at a distance\n\n\nIt is frequently argued or maintained that violations of OI involve\nstate non-separability and/or some type of holism, whereas violations\nof PI involve action at a distance. For notable examples, Howard\n(1989) argues that spatiotemporal separability (see section 4.3)\nimplies OI, and accordingly a violation of it implies spatiotemporal\nnon-separability; Teller (1989) argues that particularism (see section\n4.3) implies OI, and thus a violation of it implies relational holism;\nand Jarrett (1984, 1989) argues that a violation of PI involves some\ntype of action at a distance. These views are controversial,\nhowever.\n\n\nFirst, as we have seen in section 5, in quantum theories the\nviolation of either of these conditions involves some type of\nnon-separability and/or holism.\n\n\nSecond, the explicit attempts to derive OI from separability or\nparticularism seem to rely (implicitly) on some locality conditions.\nMaudlin (1998, p. 98) and Berkovitz (1998a, section 6.1) argue that\nHoward's precise formulation of spatiotemporal separability embodies\nboth separability and locality conditions, and Berkovitz (1998a,\nsection 6.2) argues that Teller's derivation of OI from particularism\nimplicitly relies on locality conditions. Thus, the violation of OI\nper se does not imply non-separability or holism.\n\n\nThird, a factorizable model, i.e., model that satisfies OI, may be\nnon-separable (Berkovitz 1995b, section 6.5). Thus, OI cannot be simply\nidentified with separability.\n\n\nFourth, Howard's spatiotemporal separability condition (see section\n4.3) requires that states of composite systems be determined by the\nstates of their subsystems. In particular, spatiotemporal separability\nrequires that joint probabilities of outcomes be determined as some\nfunction of the single probabilities of these outcomes. Winsberg and\nFine (2003) object that as a separability condition, OI arbitrarily\nrestricts this function to be a product function. And they argue that\non a weakened formalization of separability, a violation of OI is\ncompatible with separability. Fogel (2004) agrees that Winsberg and\nFine's weakened formalization of separability is correct, but argues\nthat, when supplemented by a certain \u2018isotropy\u2019 condition,\nOI implies this weakened separability condition. Fogel believes that\nhis suggested \u2018isotropy\u2019 condition is very plausible, but,\nas he acknowledges, this condition involves a nontrivial measurement\n context-independence.[33]\n\n\nFifth, as the analysis in section 5 demonstrates, violations of OI\nmight involve action at a distance. Also, while the minimal Bohm\ntheory violates PI and arguably some modal interpretations do not, the\ntype of action at a distance they postulate, namely action* at a\ndistance (see section 5.2), is similar: In both cases, an earlier\nspin-measurement in (say) the L-wing does not induce any immediate\nchange in the intrinsic properties of the R-particle. The\nL-measurement only causes an immediate change in the dispositions of\nthe R-particle\u2014a change that may influence the behavior of the\nR-particle in future spin-measurements in the R-wing. But, this change\nof dispositions does not involve any change of local properties in the\nR-wing, as these dispositions are relational (rather than intrinsic)\nproperties of the R-particle. Furthermore, the action at a distance\npredicated by the minimal Bohm theory is weaker than the one\npredicated by orthodox collapse quantum mechanics and the GRW/Pearle\ncollapse models; for in contrast to the minimal Bohm theory, in these\ntheories the measurement on the L-particle induces a change in the\nintrinsic properties of the R-particle, independently of whether or\nnot the R-particle undergoes a measurement. Thus, if the R-particle\ncomes to possess (momentarily) a definite position, the EPR/B\nexperiment as described by these theories involves action at a\ndistance \u2014 a stronger kind of action than the action* at a\ndistance predicated by the minimal Bohm theory.\n8.2 Superluminal signaling\n\n\nIt was also argued, notably by Jarrett 1984 and 1989 and Shimony 1984,\nthat in contrast to violations of OI, violations of PI may give rise\n(at least in principle) to superluminal signaling. Indeed, as is not\ndifficult to see from section 7.1, in theories that satisfy\n\u03bb-independence there is an asymmetry between failures of PI and\nfailures of OI with respect to superluminal signaling: whereas\n\u03bb-distribution and the failure of PI are sufficient conditions\nfor the in-principle possibility of superluminal signaling,\n\u03bb-distribution and the failure of OI are not. Thus, the\nprospects of superluminal signaling look better in parameter-dependent\ntheories, i.e., theories that violate PI. Yet, as we have seen in\nsection 7.2.1, if the Bohmian quantum-equilbrium distribution obtains,\nthen Bohm's theory, the paradigm of parameter dependent theories,\nprohibits superluminal signaling. And if this distribution is obtained\nas a matter of law, then Bohm's theory prohibits superluminal\nsignaling even in theory. Furthermore, as we remarked in section 7.1,\nif the in-principle possibility of violating \u03bb-independence is\nnot excluded, superluminal signaling may exist in theories that\nsatisfy PI and violate OI. In fact, as section 7.4 seems to suggest,\nthe possibility of superluminal signaling in theories that satisfy PI\nbut violate OI cannot be discounted even when \u03bb-independence is\nimpossible.\n8.3 Relativity\n\n\nJarrett (1984, 1989), Ballentine and Jarrett (1997) and Shimony (1984)\nhold that superluminal signaling is incompatible with relativity\ntheory. Accordingly, they conclude that violations of PI are\nincompatible with relativity theory, whereas violations of OI may be\ncompatible with this theory. Furthermore, Sutherland (1985, 1989)\nargues that deterministic, relativistic parameter-dependent theories\n(i.e., relativistic, deterministic theories that violate PI) would\nplausibly require retro-causal influences, and in certain experimental\ncircumstances this type of influences would give rise to causal\nparadoxes, i.e., inconsistent closed causal loops (where effects\nundermine their very causes). And Arntzenius (1994) argues that all\nrelativistic parameter-dependent theories are impossible on pain of\ncausal paradoxes. That is, he argues that in certain experimental\ncircumstances any relativistic, parameter-dependent theory would give\nrise to closed causal loops in which violations of PI could not\nobtain.  \n\n\nIt is noteworthy that the view that relativity per se is\nincompatible with superluminal signaling is disputable (for more\ndetails, see section 10). Anyway, recalling (section 8.2), if\n\u03bb-distribution is excluded as a matter of law, it will be\nimpossible even in theory to exploit the violation of PI to give rise\nto superluminal signaling, in which case the possibility of\nrelativistic parameter-dependent theories could not be discounted on\nthe basis of superluminal signaling.\n\n\nFurthermore, as mentioned in section 7.1 and 7.4, the in-principle\npossibility of superluminal signaling in theories that satisfy PI and\nviolate OI cannot be excluded a priori. Thus, if relativity\ntheory excludes superluminal signaling, the argument from superluminal\nsignaling may also be applied to exclude the possibility of some\nrelativistic outcome-dependent theories. \n\n\nFinally, Berkovitz (2002) argues that Arntzenius's argument for the\nimpossibility of relativistic theories that violate PI is based on\nassumptions about probabilities that are common in linear causal\nsituations but are unwarranted in causal loops, and that the real\nchallenge for these theories is that in such loops their predictive\npower is undermined (for more details, see section 10.3). \n8.4 Superluminal causation\n\n\nIn various counterfactual and probabilistic accounts of causation\nviolations of PI entail superluminal causation between the setting of\nthe nearby measurement apparatus and the distant measurement outcome,\nwhereas violations of OI entail superluminal causation between the\ndistant measurement outcomes (see Butterfield 1992b, 1994, Berkovitz\n1998b, section 2). Thus, it seems that theories that violate PI\npostulate a different type of superluminal causation than theories\nthat violate OI. Yet, as Berkovitz (1998b, section 2.4) argues, the\nviolation of PI in Bohm's theory does involve some type of\noutcome dependence, which may be interpreted as a generalization of\nthe violation of OI. In this theory, the specific R-measurement\noutcome in the EPR/B experiment depends on the specific L-measurement\noutcome: For any three different directions x, y,\nz, if the probabilities of x-spin \u2018up\u2019\nand y-spin \u2018up\u2019 are non-zero, the probability of\nR-outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019 will generally depend on\nwhether the L-outcome is x-spin \u2018up\u2019 or\ny-spin \u2018up\u2019.  Yet, due to the determinism that\nBohm's theory postulates, OI trivially obtains. Put it another way, OI\ndoes not reflect all the types of outcome independence that may exist\nbetween distant outcomes.  Accordingly, the fact that a theory\nsatisfies OI does not entail that it does not involve some other type\nof outcome dependence. Indeed, in all the current quantum theories\nthat violate factorizability there are correlations between distant\nspecific measurement outcomes \u2014 correlations that may well be\ninterpreted as an indication of counterfactual superluminal causation\nbetween these outcomes.\n8.5 On the origin and nature of parameter dependence\n\n\nParameter dependence (PI) postulates that in the EPR/B experiment the\nprobability of the later, distant measurement outcome depends on the\nsetting of the apparatus of the nearby, earlier measurement. It may be\ntempting to assume that this dependence is due to a direct influence\nof the nearby setting on the (probability of the) distant outcome. But\na little reflection on the failure of PI in Bohm's theory, which is\nthe paradigm for parameter dependence, demonstrates that the setting\nof the nearby apparatus per se has no influence on the\ndistant measurement outcome.  Rather, it is because the setting of the\nnearby measurmenent apparatus influences the nearby measurement\noutcome and the nearby outcome influences the distant outcome that the\nsetting of the nearby apparatus can have an influence on the distant\noutcome. For, as is not difficult to see from the analysis of the\nnature of non-locality in the minimal Bohm theory (see section 5.3.1),\nthe setting of the apparatus of the nearby (earlier) measurement in\nthe EPR/B experiment influences the outcome the nearby measurement,\nand this outcome influences the guiding field of the distant particle\nand accordingly the outcome of a measurement on that particle.\n\n\nWhile the influence of the nearby setting on the nearby outcome is\nnecessary for parameter dependence, it is not sufficient for it. In\nall the current quantum theories, the probabilities of joint outcomes\nin the EPR/B experiment depend on the settings of both measurement\napparatuses: The probability that the L-outcome is l-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 and the R-outcome is r-spin \u2018up\u2019\nand the probability that the L-outcome is l-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 and the R-outcome is r-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 both depend on (l \u2212 r),\ni.e.,  the distance between the angles l and r. In\ntheories in which the sum of these joint probabilities is invariant\nwith respect to the value of (l \u2212 r),\nparameter independence obtains: for all pairs' states \u03bb,\nL-setting l, and R-settings r and r\u2032,\nL-outcome xl, and R-outcomes\nyr and yr\u2032\u2009:\n\n\n(PI) \nP\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r(xl & \nyr) + \nP\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r(xl &\n\u00acyr) =\nP\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r\u2032\u2009(xl \n& yr\u2032\u2009) +\nP\u03bb\u2009l\u2009r\u2032\u2009(xl \n& \u00acyr\u2032\u2009).\n \n\n\n\n\nParameter dependence is a violation of this invariance condition.\n9. Can there be \u2018local\u2019 quantum theories?\n\n\nThe focus of this entry has been on exploring the nature of the\nnon-local influences in the quantum realm as depicted by quantum\ntheories that violate factorizability, i.e., theories in which the\njoint probability of the distant outcomes in the EPR/B experiment do\nnot factorize into the product of the single probabilities of these\noutcomes. The motivation for this focus was that, granted plausible\nassumptions, factorizability must fail (see section 2), and its\nfailure implies some type of non-locality (see sections 2-8). But if\nany of these plausible assumptions failed, it may be possible to\naccount for the EPR/B experiment (and more generally for all other\nquantum phenomena) without postulating any non-local influences. Let\nus then consider the main arguments for the view that quantum\nphenomena need not involve non-locality.\n\n In arguments for the failure of factorizability, it is presupposed\nthat the distant measurement outcomes in the EPR/B experiment are real\nphysical events. Recall (section 5.3.3) that in Albert and Loewer's\n(1988) many-minds interpretation this is not the case. In this\ninterpretation, definite measurement outcomes are (typically) not\nphysical events. In particular, the pointers of the measurement\napparatuses in the EPR/B experiment do not display any definite\noutcomes. Measurement outcomes in the EPR/B experiment exist only as\n(non-physical) mental states in observers' minds (which are\npostulated to be non-physical entities). So sacrificing some of our\nmost fundamental presuppositions about the physical reality and\nassuming a controversial mind-body dualism, the many-minds\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics does not postulate any action at a\ndistance or superluminal causation between the distant wings of the\nEPR/B experiment. Yet, as quantum-mechanical states of systems are\nassumed to reflect their physical states, the many-minds theory does\npostulate some type of non-locality, namely state non-separability and\nproperty and relational holism.\n\n Another way to get around Bell's argument for non-locality in the\nEPR/B experiment is to construct a model of this experiment that\nsatisfies factorizability but violates \u03bb-independence (i.e.,\nthe assumption that the distribution of all the possible pairs' states\nin the EPR/B experiment is independent of the measured quantities). In\nsection 2, we mentioned two possible causal explanations for the\nfailure of \u03bb-independence. The first is to postulate that\npairs' states and apparatus settings share a common cause, which\ncorrelates certain types of pairs' states with certain types of\nsettings (e.g. states of type \u03bb1 are correlated with\nsettings of type l and r, whereas states of type\n\u03bb2 are correlated with settings of type\nl\u2032 and r\u2032, etc.). As we noted, thinking\nabout all the various ways one can measure properties, this\nexplanation seems conspiratorial. Furthermore, it runs counter to one\nof the most fundamental presuppositions of empirical science, namely\nthat in experiments preparations of sources and settings of\nmeasurement apparatuses are typically independent of each other. The\nsecond possible explanation is to postulate causation from the\nmeasurement events backward to the source at the emission time. (For\nadvocates of this way out of non-locality, see Costa de Beauregard\n1977, 1979, 1985, Sutherland 1983, 1998, 2006 and Price 1984, 1994,\n1996, chapters 3, 8 and 9.) Maudlin (1994, p. 197-201) argues that\ntheories that postulate such causal mechanism are\ninconsistent. Berkovitz (2002, section 5) argues that Maudlin's line\nof reasoning is based on unwarranted premises. Yet, as we shall see in\nsection 10.3, this way out of non-locality faces some\nchallenges. Furthermore, while a violation of \u03bb-independence\nprovides a way out of Bell's theorem, it does not necessarily imply\nlocality; for the violation of \u03bb-independence is compatible\nwith the failure of factorizability. \n\n\nA third way around non-locality is to \u2018exploit\u2019 the\ninefficiency of measurement devices or (more generally) measurement\nset-ups. In any actual EPR/B experiment, many of the particle pairs\nemitted from the source fail to be detected, so that only a sample of\nthe particle pairs is observed. Assuming that the observed samples are\nnot biased, it is now generally agreed that the statistical\npredictions of orthodox quantum mechanics have been vindicated (for a\nreview of these experiments, see Redhead 1987, section 4.5). But if\nthis assumption is abandoned, there are perfectly local causal\nexplanations for the actual experimental results (Clauser and Horne\n1974, Fine 1982b, 1989a). Many believe that this way out of\nnon-locality is ad hoc, at least in light of our current\nknowledge. Moreover, this strategy would fail if the efficiency of\nmeasurement devices exceeded a certain threshold (for more details,\nsee Fine 1989a, Maudlin 1994, chapter 6, Larsson and Semitecolos 2000\nand Larsson 2002). \n\n\nFinally, there are those who question the assumption that\nfactorizability is a locality condition (Fine 1981, 1986, pp. 59-60,\n1989b, Cartwright 1989, chaps. 3 and 6, Chang and Cartwright 1993).\nAccordingly, they deny that non-factorizability implies non-locality.\nThe main thrust of this line of reasoning is that the principle of the\ncommon cause is not generally valid. Some, notably Cartwright (1989)\nand Chang and Cartwright (1993), challenge the assumption that common\ncauses always screen off the correlation between their effects, and\naccordingly they question the idea that non-factorizability implies\nnon-locality. Others, notably Fine, deny that correlations must have\ncausal explanation. \n\n\nWhile these arguments challenge the view that the quantum realm as\ndepicted by non-factorizable models for the EPR/B experiment\nmust involve non-locality, they do not show that viable\nlocal, non-factorizable models of the EPR/B experiment (i.e., viable\nmodels which do not postulate any non-locality) are possible. Indeed,\nso far none of the attempts to construct local, non-factorisable\nmodels for EPR/B experiments has been successful. \n10. Can quantum non-locality be reconciled with relativity?\n\n\nThe question of the compatibility of quantum mechanics with the\nspecial theory of relativity is very difficult to resolve. (The\nquestion of the compatibility of quantum mechanics with the general\ntheory of relativity is even more involved.) The answer to this\nquestion depends on the interpretation of special relativity and the\nnature of the exact constraints it imposes on influences between\nevents. \n\n\nA popular view has it that special relativity prohibits any\nsuperluminal influences, whereas theories that violate factorizability\nseem to involve such influences. Accordingly, it is held that quantum\nmechanics is incompatible with relativity. Another common view has it\nthat special relativity prohibits only certain types of superluminal\ninfluence. Many believe that relativity prohibits superluminal\nsignaling of information. Some also believe that this theory prohibits\nsuperluminal transport of matter-energy and/or\naction-at-a-distance. On the other hand, there is the view that\nrelativity per se prohibits only superluminal influences that\nare incompatible with the special-relativistic space-time, the\nso-called \u2018Minkowski space-time,\u2019 and that this\nprohibition is compatible with certain types of superluminal\ninfluences and superluminal signaling (for a comprehensive discussion\nof this issue, see Maudlin, 1994, 1996, section\n 2).[34]\n\n\n\nIt is commonly agreed that relativity requires that the descriptions\nof physical reality (i.e., the states of systems, their properties,\ndynamical laws, etc.) in different coordinate systems should be\ncompatible with each other. In particular, descriptions of the state of\nsystems in different foliations of spacetime into parallel spacelike\nhyperplanes, which correspond to different inertial reference frames,\nare to be related to each other by the Lorentz transformations. If this\nrequirement is to reflect the structure of the Minkowski spacetime,\nthese transformations must hold at the level of individual processes,\nand not only at the level of ensembles of processes (i.e., at the\nstatistical level) or observed phenomena. Indeed, Bohm's theory,\nwhich is manifestly non-relativistic, satisfies the requirement that\nthe Lorentz transformations obtain at the level of the observed\nphenomena. \n\n\nHowever, satisfying the Lorentz transformations at the level of\nindividual processes is not sufficient for compatibility with\nMinkowski spacetime; for the Lorentz transformations may also be\nsatisfied at the level of individual processes in theories that\npostulate a preferred inertial reference frame (Bell 1976). Maudlin\n(1996, section 2) suggests that a theory is genuinely relativistic\n(both in spirit and letter) if it can be formulated without ascribing\nto spacetime any more, or different intrinsic structure than the\nrelativistic\n metrics.[35]\nThe question of the compatibility of\nrelativity with quantum mechanics may be presented as follows: Could a\nquantum theory that does not encounter the measurement problem be\nrelativistic in that sense?  \n10.1 Collapse theories\n\n\nThe main problem in reconciling collapse theories with special\nrelativity is that it seems very difficult to make state collapse\n(modeled as a real physical process) compatible with the structure of\nthe Minkowski spacetime. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the\nearlier L-measurement in the EPR/B experiment induces a collapse of the\nentangled state of the particle pair and the L-measurement apparatus.\nAssuming (for the sake of simplicity) that measurement events occur\ninstantaneously, state collapse occurs along a single spacelike\nhyperplane that intersects the spacetime region of the L-measurement\nevent\u2014the hyperplane that represents the (absolute) time of the\ncollapse. But this type of collapse dynamics would involve a preferred\nfoliation of spacetime, in violation of the spirit, if not the letter\nof the Minkowski spacetime. \n\n\nThe current dynamical collapse models are not genuinely\nrelativistic, and attempts to generalize them to the special\nrelativistic domain have encountered difficulties (see, for\nexample, the entry on collapse theories, Ghirardi 1996, Pearle 1996,\nand references therein). A more recent attempt to address these\ndifficulties due to Tumulka (2004) seems more promising.\n\n\nIn an attempt to reconcile state collapse with special relativity,\nFleming (1989, 1992, 1996) and Fleming and Bennett (1989) suggested\nradical hyperplane dependence. In their theory, state collapse occurs\nalong an infinite number of spacelike hyperplanes that intersect the\nspacetime region of the measurements. That is, in the EPR/B experiment\na collapse occurs along all the hyperplanes of simultaneity that\nintersect the spacetime region of the L-measurement. Similarly, a\ncollapse occurs along all the hyperplanes of simultaneity that\nintersect the distant (space-like separated) spacetime region of the\nR-measurement. Accordingly, the hyperplane-dependent theory does not\npick out any reference frame as preferred, and the dynamics of the\nquantum states of systems and their properties can be reconciled with\nthe Minkowski spacetime. Further, since all the multiple collapses are\nsupposed to be real (Fleming 1992, p. 109), the predictions of\northodox quantum mechanics are reproduced in each reference\nframe. \n\n\nThe hyperplane-dependent theory is genuinely relativistic. But the\ntheory does not offer any mechanism for state collapses, and it does\nnot explain how the multiple collapses are related to each other and\nhow our experience is accounted for in light of this multiplicity.\n\n\nMyrvold (2002b) argues that state collapses can be reconciled with\nMinkowski spacetime even without postulating multiple different\ncollapses corresponding to different reference frames. That is, he\nargues with respect to the EPR/B experiment that the collapses induced\nby the L- and the R-measurement are local events in the L- and the\nR-wing respectively, and that the supposedly different collapses\n(corresponding to different reference frames) postulated by the\nhyperplane-dependent theory are only different descriptions of the\nsame local collapse events. Focusing on the state of the particle\npair, the main idea is that the collapse event in the L-wing is\nmodeled by a (one parameter) family of operators (the identity\noperator before the L-measurement and a projection to the collapsed\nstate after the L-measurement), and it is local in the sense that it\nis a projection on the Hilbert space of the L-particle; and similarly,\nmutatis mutandis, for the R-particle. Yet, if the quantum\nstate of the particle pair represents their complete state (as the\ncase is in the orthodox theory and the GRW/Pearle collapse models),\nthese collapse events seem non-local. While the collapse in the L-wing\nmay be said to be local in the above technical sense, it is by\ndefinition a change of local as well as distant (spacelike)\nproperties. The operator that models the collapse in the L-wing\ntransforms the entangled state of the particle pair\u2014a state in\nwhich the particles have no definite spins\u2014into a product of\nnon-entangled states in which both particles have definite spins, and\naccordingly it causes a change of intrinsic properties in both the L-\nand the R-wing.\n \n\nIn any case, Myrvold's proposal demonstrates that even if state\ncollapses are not hyperplane dependent, they need not be incompatible\nwith relativity theory.\n10.2 No-collapse theories\n\n\nRecall (section 5.3) that in no-collapse theories, quantum-mechanical\nstates always evolve according to a unitary and linear equation of\nmotion (the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the non-relativistic case),\nand accordingly they never collapse. Since the wave function has a\ncovariant dynamics, the question of the compatibility with relativity\nturns on the dynamics of the additional properties \u2014the\nso-called \u2018hidden variables\u2019\u2014 that no-collapse\ntheories typically postulate. In Albert and Loewer's many-minds theory\n(see section 5.3.3), the wave function has covariant dynamics, and no\nadditional physical properties are postulated. Accordingly, the theory\nis genuinely relativistic. Yet, as the compatibility with relativity\nis achieved at the cost of postulating that outcomes of measurements\n(and, typically, any other perceived properties) are mental rather\nthan physical properties, many find this way of reconciling quantum\nmechanics with relativity unsatisfactory. \n\n\nOther Everett-like interpretations attempt to reconcile quantum\nmechanics with the special theory of relativity without postulating\nsuch a controversial mind-body dualism. Similarly to the many-minds\ninterpretation of Albert and Loewer, and contrary to Bohm's theory and\nmodal interpretations, on the face of it these interpretations do not\npostulate the existence of \u2018hidden variables.\u2019 But\n(recalling section 5.3.3) these Everett-like interpretations face the\nchallenge of making sense of our experience and the probabilities of\noutcomes, and critics of these interpretations argue that this\nchallenge cannot be met without adding some extra structure to the\nEverett interpretation (see Albert and Loewer 1988, Albert 1992,\npp. 114-5, Albert and Loewer 1996, Price 1996, pp.  226-227, and\nBarrett 1999, pp. 163-173); a structure that may render these\ninterpretations incompatible with relativity. Supporters of the\nEverett interpretation disagree. Recently, Deutsch (1999), Wallace\n(2002, 2003, 2005a,b) and Greaves (2004) have suggested that\nEverettians can make sense of the quantum-mechanical probabilities by\nappealing to decision-theoretical considerations. But this line of\nreasoning has been disputed (see Barnum et al. 2000, Lewis\n2003b, Hemmo and Pitowsky 2005 and Price 2006). \n\n\nModal interpretations constitute another class of no-collapse\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics that were developed to reconcile\nquantum mechanics with relativity (and to solve the measurement\nproblem). Yet, as the no-go theorems by Dickson and Clifton (1998),\nArntzenius (1998) and Myrvold (2002) demonstrate, the earlier versions\nof the modal interpretation are not genuinely compatible with\nrelativity theory. Further, Earman and Ruetsche (2005) argue that a\nquantum-field version of the modal interpretation (which is set in the\ncontext of relativistic quantum-field theory), like the one proposed\nby Clifton (2000), would be subject to serious challenges.  Berkovitz\nand Hemmo (2006a,b) develop a relational modal interpretation that\nescapes all the above no-go theorems and to that extent seems to\nprovide better prospects for reconciling quantum mechanics with\nspecial relativity. \n10.3 Quantum causal loops and relativity\n\n\nRecall (section 8) that many believe that parameter-dependent theories\n(i.e., theories that violate parameter independence) are more difficult\nor even impossible to reconcile with relativity. Recall also that one\nof the lines of argument for the impossibility of relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories is that such theories would give rise to\ncausal paradoxes. In our discussion, we focused on EPR/B experiments\nin which the measurements are distant (spacelike separated). In a\nrelativistic parameter-dependent theory, the setting of the nearby\nmeasurement apparatus in the EPR/B experiment would influence the\nprobability of the distant (spacelike separated) measurement\noutcome. Sutherland (1985, 1989) argues that it is plausible to\nsuppose that the realization of parameter dependence would be the same\nin EPR/B experiments in which the measurements are not distant from\neach other (i.e., when the measurements are timelike separated). If so,\nrelativistic parameter-dependent theories would involve backward\ncausal influences. But, he argues, in deterministic, relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories these influences would give rise to\ncausal paradoxes, i.e., inconsistent closed causal loops.\n \n\nFurthermore, Arntzenius (1994) argues that all relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories are impossible on pain of causal\nparadoxes. In his argument, he considers the probabilities of\nmeasurement outcomes in a setup in which two EPR/B experiments are\ncausally connected to each other, so that the L-measurement outcome of\nthe first EPR/B experiment determines the setting of the L-apparatus\nof the second EPR/B experiment and the R-measurement outcome of the\nsecond EPR/B experiment determines the setting of the R-apparatus of\nthe first EPR/B experiment. And he argues that in this experiment,\nrelativistic parameter-dependent theories (deterministic or\nindeterministic) would give rise to closed causal loops in which\nparameter dependence would be impossible. Thus, he concludes that\nrelativistic, parameter-dependent theories are impossible. (Stairs\n(1989) anticipates the argument that the above experimental setup may\ngive rise to causal paradoxes in relativistic, parameter-dependent\ntheories, but he stops short of arguing that such theories are\nimpossible.)\n\n\nBerkovitz (1998b, section 3.2, 2002, section 4) argues that\nArntzenius's line of reasoning fails because it is based on untenable\nassumptions about the nature of probabilities in closed causal\nloops\u2014assumptions that are very natural in linear causal\nsituations (where effects do not cause their causes), but untenable in\ncausal loops. (For an analysis of the nature of probabilities in\ncausal loops, see Berkovitz 2001 and 2002, section 2.) Thus, he\nconcludes that the consistency of relativistic parameter-dependent\ntheories cannot be excluded on the grounds of causal paradoxes. He\nalso argues that the real challenge for relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories is concerned with their predictive\npower. In the causal loops predicted by relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories in Arntzenius's suggested experiment,\nthere is no known way to compute the frequency of events from the\nprobabilities that the theories prescribe. Accordingly, such theories\nwould fail to predict any definite statistics of measurement outcomes\nfor that experiment. This lack of predictability may also present some\nnew opportunities. Due to this unpredictability, there may be an\nempirical way for arbitrating between these theories and quantum\ntheories that do not predicate the existence such causal loops in\nArntzenius's experiment. \n\n\nAnother attempt to demonstrate the impossibility of certain\nrelativistic quantum theories on the grounds of causal paradoxes is\nadvanced by Maudlin (1994, pp. 195-201). (Maudlin does not present his\nargument in these terms, but the argument is in effect based on such\ngrounds.) Recall (sections 2 and 9) that a way to try to reconcile\nquantum mechanics with relativity is to account for the curious\ncorrelations between distant systems by local backward influences\nrather than non-local influences. In particular, one may postulate\nthat the correlations between the distant measurement outcomes in the\nEPR/B experiment are due to local influences from the measurement\nevents backward to the state of the particle pair at the source. In\nsuch models of the EPR/B experiment, influences on events are always\nconfined to events that occur in their past or future light cones, and\nno non-locality is postulated. Maudlin argues that theories that\npostulate such backward causation will be inconsistent. More\nparticularly, he argues that a plausible reading of Cramer's (1980,\n1986) transactional interpretation, and any other theory that\nsimilarly attempts to account for the EPR/B correlations by\npostulating causation from the measurement events backward to the\nsource, will be inconsistent. \n\n\nBerkovitz (2002, section 5) argues that Maudlin's argument is, in\neffect, that if such retro-causal theories were true, they would\ninvolve closed causal loops in which the probabilities of outcomes\nthat these theories assign will certainly deviate from the statistics\nof these outcomes. And, similarly to Arntzenius's argument, Maudlin's\nargument also rests on untenable assumptions about the nature of\nprobabilities in causal loops (for a further discussion of Maudlin's\nand Berkovitz's arguments and, more generally, the prospects of\nCramer's theory, see Kastner 2004). Furthermore, Berkovitz (2002,\nsections 2 and 5.4) argues that, similarly to relativistic\nparameter-dependent theories, the main challenge for theories that\npostulate retro-causality is not causal paradoxes, but rather the fact\nthat their predictive power may be undermined. That is, the\nprobabilities assigned by such theories may fail to predict the\nfrequency of events in the loops they predicate. In particular, the\nlocal retro-causal theories that Maudlin considers fail to assign any\ndefinite predictions for the frequency of measurement outcomes in\ncertain experiments. Yet, some other theories that predicate the\nexistence of causal loops, such as Sutherland's (2006) local\ntime-symmetric Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics, seem not\nto suffer from this problem.\n",
