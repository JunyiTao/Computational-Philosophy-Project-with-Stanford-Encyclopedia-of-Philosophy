    "preamble": "\n\nOne of the points where there is a significant, long-lasting\nintersection of the interests of many philosophers with the interests\nof many people of all kinds and conditions concerns the nature and\nsignificance of death. How should we understand the mortality of all\nliving things and, closer to home, how should we understand our own\nmortality? Is it possible for persons to survive biological death?\nThis is a topic that has occupied both analytic and continental\nphilosophy in the twentieth century (e.g., Fred Feldman, Martin\nHeidegger). When the topic of death is ignored or denied in popular\nculture, some philosophers, theologians, social and political critics\nrail against the inauthentic complacency of ignoring one of the most\nimportant facts about our lives (see, for example, S\u00f8ren\nKierkegaard\u2019s essay \u201cAt a Graveside\u201d or Ernest\nBecker\u2019s famous 1974 book, The Denial of Death). But\nwhat precisely are the facts of death? Is it true that a person is\nannihilated when she dies, or is there a possibility or even a\nlikelihood that she may survive death? Are any of the religious\nconceptions of an afterlife promising from a philosophical point of\nview?\n\nThere are five sections in this entry. In the first, we propose that\nbeliefs about death and the possibility of an afterlife are of\nenduring significance because of our care for persons here and now,\nand thus our concern for their future and our own. Just as it is\nreasonable to hope that those we love have a fulfilling future in this\nlife, it is natural to consider whether this life is the only life\nthere is and, if there is reason to believe that there is an afterlife\n(or a life beyond this life), it would be reasonable to hope that this\nmight involve a new, valuable environment or at least one that is not\nHellish in nature. We bring to the fore other reasons why the topic of\nan afterlife is philosophically interesting. In sections two and three\nwe consider the concept and possibility that persons survive death in\nlight of two substantial philosophies of mind: dualism (section two)\nand materialism (section three). Section four addresses the afterlife\nin terms of empirical evidence. In section five, reasons are advanced\nfor thinking that the reasonability of beliefs about an afterlife\ndepends on the reasonability of metaphysical convictions.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Survival and its Alternatives\n\nIn ancient Western philosophy, Plato affirmed both a pre-natal life of\nthe soul and the soul\u2019s continued life after the death of the\nbody. In Plato\u2019s Phaedo, Socrates presents reasons why\na philosopher should even welcome death (albeit not permitting or\nencouraging suicide), because of its emancipation of the souls of\nthose who are good in this life to a great afterlife. In the work of\nEpictetus, on the other hand, death is conceived of as a\nperson\u2019s ceasing to be. Epictetus does not argue that we should\nwelcome death but he holds that we should not fear death because we\nwill not exist after death. The philosophical assessment of the truth\nof such matters continues on to the present, as does debate on the\nimplications of whether we may survive death. Why?\n\nThere are many reasons why there should be ongoing attention as to\nwhether Plato or Epictetus\u2014or any other philosopher who offers a\ndifferent account about the reality or illusion of an\nafterlife\u2014is right. One reason is that the values we have in the\nhere and now have a bearing on what we may or should hope for in terms\nof the future. While some philosophers believe that what happens in\nthe future has enormous consequences for life\u2019s meaning now,\nother philosophers have so focused on the importance of the present\nthat questions about the future of humanity in this life, and the\npossible good or ill of an afterlife for individuals, is of little\nimportance. Consider two philosophers who take the latter position,\nPeter Singer and Erik Wielenberg.\n\nSinger asks us to consider a case when some good act is done and its\ngoodness does not depend upon the future. Imagine a village where\nthere is great need and that need is met with aid. Singer claims that\nthe goodness of such an act should not depend on the long term; one\ncan place to one side speculation about what might happen a thousand\nyears later.\n\n\nSuppose that we become involved in a project to help a small community\nin a developing country to become free of debt and self-sufficient in\nfood. The project is an outstanding success, and the villagers are\nhealthier, happier, better educated, and economically secure and have\nfewer children. Now someone might say \u201cwhat good have you done?\nIn a thousand years people will all be dead, and their children and\ngrandchildren as well, and nothing that you have done will make any\ndifference\u201d. (Singer 1993: 274) \n\n\nSinger responds: \n\n\nWe should not, however, think of our efforts as wasted unless they\nendure forever, or even for a very long time. (1993: 274) \n\n\nHis solution is to think of the universe in four-dimensional terms;\naccording to this philosophy of time, all times are equally real. On\nthis view, it is always the case that in the year 2020, the lives of\nthe villagers are made better; they are happy, healthy, and well\neducated in 2020. \n\nErik Wielenberg does not adopt Singer\u2019s recourse to the\nphilosophy of time but, like Singer, his counsel is that we should not\nthink (or need not think) in terms of the big picture or the future in\nassessing the meaning and urgency of our current projects\n\n\nIsn\u2019t it better that the Nazi Holocaust ended when it did rather\nthan in, say, 1970\u2014regardless of what the world will be like a\nmillion years from now? I can remember occasions in junior high gym\nclass when a basketball or volleyball game became particularly heated\nand adolescent tempers flared. Our gym teacher sometimes attempted to\ncalm us down with such rhetorical questions as, \u201cTen years from\nnow, will any of you care who won this game?\u201d It always struck\nme that a reasonable response to such a query would be, \u201cDoes it\nreally matter now whether any of us will care in ten years?\u201d In\nmuch the same vein, Thomas Nagel suggests, \u201cit does not matter\nnow that in a million years nothing we do now will matter\u201d.\n(2013: 345)\n\n\nA possible response is that while there is some wisdom in\nSinger\u2019s and Wielenberg\u2019s positions, they should not\ndissuade us from appreciating that the natural trajectory of the love\nof people and wisdom (or philosophy) includes concern for \u201cthe\nbig picture\u201d. If Singer truly cares about the villagers,\nshouldn\u2019t he hope that they survive to enjoy the fruits of the\ninvestments that have been made? Or, putting this in four-dimensional\ntime terms; shouldn\u2019t he wish that they are happy in 2030 and\n2040\u2026? Surely those providing aid are not (and should not be)\nindifferent about the future. Granted, if the investment was made and\nthen a meteor struck the village, destroying all life (or if in 2030\nthe meteor is destroying the village), we might well think the\ninvestment was still wise, good and noble (especially if there were no\npredictions of a meteor strike). However, there would be something\ndeeply disturbing if one of the aid-givers announced upon leaving the\nvillage: \n\n\nNo matter what happens, no matter whether you all are struck by a\nmassive plague in an hour and all die a horrible death or whether a\nthousand years from now your society will be condemned as deserving of\nnothing but contempt, what we have done today is our only concern and\nthe value of our act is not diminished regardless of what awaits you!\n\n\n\nWe suggest that this attitude would be bizarre. Returning to the\nquestion of the afterlife, if you think that some good afterlife is\npossible, one should hope for the long-term flourishing of the\nvillagers in both this life and the next rather than focusing only on\nthe value of their present position. And if you do have such a hope,\nwhy hope that the lives of everyone will come to an end at a specific\ntime, say in a thousand years? Similarly, if you believe that it is\nlikely or even possible that there is an afterlife where there is\ngreat ongoing harm, should we not hope that this not be the case for\nthe villagers?\n\nWielenberg\u2019s comments on the Holocaust are puzzling. Of course,\nno one except a murderous, psychopathic Nazi would hope the Holocaust\nlasted longer or that it involved the death of even one more\nindividual. But what one hopes will take place a million years from\nnow is not irrelevant ethically or in terms of values. Consider two\nfutures: in one, the Jews survive a million years from now and are\nthriving. In another, imagine that a million years from now there is a\nrevival of the Nazi party. The Jews have colonized Mars and Nazi\ngenocidal units are dispatched to treat Jewish settlements the way the\nNazis treated the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940. This time, the Nazis succeed\nin annihilating every last Jew. Surely, it would be deeply perverse to\nhope for the second future. It would also be perverse to be\nindifferent now about whether the second will occur. We cannot imagine\nthat a person of integrity would say they are utterly indifferent\nabout whether all Jews will be annihilated by Nazis in the future, be\nit a million years, ten million, twenty, or\u2026.\n\nNagel\u2019s comment (cited by Wielenberg) is worthy of note. His\ncomment suggests that what we do now will (or may) not matter a\nmillion years from now, but there is an important distinction between\nwhether some event matters (in the sense that it is valuable; it is\ngood that the event occurred) and whether persons who live in the\nfuture are aware of the event and care about it. Arguably, it will\nalways be the case that the Holocaust should not have happened,\nregardless of whether any human being remembers it a hundred (or a\nthousand or a million) years from now. Moreover, those of us who are\nhorrified about this genocide should hope that remembering it and\npassing on a record of it has no statute of limitation. In keeping\nwith our earlier thought experiment, imagine two futures: a million\nyears from now, persons recall the Holocaust and continue to lament\nthis mass genocide; in a different future imagine persons are all\nNazis and they only recall the Holocaust as a failure to succeed in\nkilling all Jews, something they were only able to achieve in the year\n1,002,014.\n\nSo, one reason why the topic of an afterlife is of historical and\ncontemporary interest is because our values about present persons,\nthings, and events have a bearing on the future, including the\npossibility of a future for individuals after their death. If we know\nthat it is impossible for individual persons to survive biological\ndeath, speculation on an afterlife we might expect or hope for would\nbe pointless (unless it serves some purpose in terms of fiction), but\nit would not be pointless to reflect on whether the impossibility of\nan afterlife should dominate our values in this life. What are the\nimplications for our lives now if we take seriously the idea that at\ndeath we will pass into oblivion? Some philosophers adopt a strategy\nlike Singer\u2019s and Wielenberg\u2019s about our individual lives.\nIn Religion Without God Ronald Dworkin is candid about\n\u201cwhat we desperately dread\u201d, namely \u201cthe total,\nobliterating, itself unimaginable, snuffing out of everything\u201d\n(2013: 150). While he thinks some kind of individual afterlife may be\npossible (even given atheistic naturalism) he does propose a\n\u201ckind of immortality\u201d which is \u201cthe only kind we\nhave any business wanting\u201d (Dworkin 2013: 159).\n\n\nWhen you do something smaller well\u2014play a tune or a part or a\nhand, throw a curve or a compliment, make a chair or a sonnet or\nlove\u2014your satisfaction is complete in itself. Those are\nachievements within life. Why can\u2019t a life also be an\nachievement complete in itself, with its own value in the art in\nliving it displays? (Dworkin 2013: 158)\n\n\nWho would deny that such acts can be great achievements? If\nindividual survival of death is impossible, then Dworkin is right to\ncast aside (as he does) the comedian Woody Allen\u2019s aspiration to\nlive on forever, not in his work, but in his apartment. But do we know\nthat an individual afterlife is impossible? Later in this entry, we\nsuggest that ruling out an afterlife as impossible is philosophically\ntenuous.  Moreover, we suggest that the goods within the life that\nDworkin describes invite us to consider whether human lives may be\nricher still if they do not end in oblivion and instead death marks a\ntransition to a form of afterlife that some of the world religions\nenvision. For an interesting secular case that many of our values in\nthe present moment are tied to expectations of the future, see\nScheffler 2016 (N.B. Scheffler is concerned with future events in this\nlife rather than an individual\u2019s life after their death.) For\nmore recent reflection on the relevance of an afterlife for the\nmeaning of life now, see Mawson 2019 and 2020.\n\nSo, we suggest that the topic of an afterlife is warranted for at\nleast three reasons: it is important if you love persons in this life\nand hope for their enduring flourishing (or hope they are not\nannihilated or meet a worse fate); it is important to think about the\nimplications of there not being an afterlife (or there being one) in\nterms of how to understand what is important to you now; and it is\nimportant to consider for historical reasons: speculation and beliefs\nabout life after death have existed through much of human history.\n\nIn most cultures, there is evidence of a belief in some sort of\npersonal afterlife, in which the same individual that lived and died\nnevertheless persists and continues to have new experiences. There are\nalternatives, however. The ancient Greeks are noted for having placed\na high premium on \u201csurvival\u201d in the memory and honor of\nthe community\u2014a practice reflected in our reference to deceased\ncelebrities as (for example) \u201cthe immortal Babe Ruth\u201d.\n(Strictly speaking, this for the Greeks was not a replacement for a\npersonal afterlife, but rather a supplement to what was conceived as a\nrather colorless and unrewarding existence in Hades.) Such a hope, it\nwould seem, provides a major consolation only if one is optimistic\nconcerning the persistence and continued memory of the community, as\nwell as the accuracy and justice of their judgments. An interesting\nvariant of this form of immorality is found in process theology, with\nits promise of \u201cobjective immortality\u201d in the mind of God,\nwho neither forgets nor misjudges the lives he remembers (Hartshorne\n1962: 262). Hindu and Buddhist traditions include a belief in\nreincarnation. Hindu philosophical tradition gives more credence to\nthe enduring of individuals through successive rebirths and deaths\nthan does Buddhist philosophical tradition see Knine 2010). In\nBuddhist philosophy, the ongoing task is to produce a sufficient\nconsciousness of the self for there to be reincarnation, while\nsimultaneously securing the understanding that the individual self is\nnot (in the end) a substantial, concrete thing, but a delusion that\nwill dissolve or become liberated into Nirvana (see Nattier 2010).\n\n\nOther entries in this encyclopedia address themes in Hindu and\nBuddhist philosophy (see, e.g., the entry on\nmind in Indian Buddhist philosophy),\nso we will forego a comparative study here of\ncompeting religious portraits of an afterlife. For two immensely\nvaluable resources for reflection on the afterlife from diverse\nreligious and philosophical perspectives, see The Palgrave Handbook of\nthe Afterlife (Nagasawa & Matheson eds. 2017) and The\nOxford Handbook to the Eschaton (Walls ed. 2010). A fascinating\nsynthesis of different religious portraits of an afterlife is\ndeveloped in Hick 1976. We also note, but do\nnot comment on, an important topic in Christian philosophical theology\nconcerning universalism, the belief that, eventually, all persons will\nbe saved (see Parry and Partridge 2003).\n\nOur focus for much of the rest of this\nentry is on the possibility and the reasonability of believing there\nis an afterlife for individual persons, though we will offer some\nobservations along the way about the kinds of afterlife that are\npossible, given different metaphysical assumptions. As for the\nphilosophers like Kierkegaard and Becker, cited earlier, who castigate\nthose of us who ignore our mortality, we suggest that sometimes the\ncontemplation of mortality can be disabling and distract us from\nseeking immediate goods (such as those Dworkin highlights) or\nrelieving suffering. It would not be admirable for the aid workers in\nSinger\u2019s example to pause in their work in order to hold\ndeath-and-dying seminars. However, while there might be nothing wrong\nin living without wrestling with mortality, there are sufficient good\nreasons why the topics of the nature of death and the existence (or\nnon-existence) of an afterlife are philosophically interesting and\ndeserving of attention.\n\nAs we turn to the question of whether it is possible for persons to\nsurvive death, it is natural to pursue an answer in light of the\nphilosophy of human persons. The next section considers survival from\nthe standpoint of mind-body dualism.\n2. The Possibility of Survival\u2014Dualism\n\nAt first, it seems obvious that dualism is a\n\u201csurvival-friendly\u201d perspective. If we are nothing more\nthan our bodies, it seems that if death destroys our bodies, we are\ndestroyed and there is nothing left of us as persons\u2014though\nparts of our bodies and the particles that make it up will be\nscattered and perhaps (temporarily) come to be part of the bodies of\nother living organisms. If, however, we are nonphysical (or\nimmaterial) minds or souls or persons who are embodied, then even the\ncomplete annihilation of our physical bodies does not entail our\nannihilation as persons. In fact, one of several arguments for dualism\nis based on the conceivability of our existing without our bodies. If\ndualism is true, however, it does not necessarily follow that persons\nwill survive the death of their bodies. It may be that the functional\ndependence of ourselves on our bodies is so essential that we only\ncome into existence as embodied persons when our bodies reach a\ncertain formation and constitution and then we cease to be when that\nformation and constitution is destroyed. But dualism at least opens\nthe door for claiming that our dependence on our bodies is contingent\n(not necessary) or is essential only given the present laws of nature\n(laws that may be violated by God). Dualist accounts of survival have\nbeen seriously questioned, however. \n\nSome philosophers argue that dualist accounts of survival fail because\nwe have no \u201ccriteria of identity\u201d for disembodied persons.\nWhen we make judgments about the identity of persons we are not making\njudgments about the identity of souls. It has been argued that we\ncannot make judgments about the identity of souls, because souls are\nsaid to be imperceptible and non-spatial. And because of this, the\nidentity of a person over time cannot consist of the identity of the\nperson\u2019s soul over time. What we are able to identify\u2014and\nre-identify\u2014is a person\u2019s body. But once the person has\ndied that body decomposes in a grave, and can\u2019t be the basis for\nour identification of the person who is supposed to have survived\ndisembodied (Perry 1978: 6\u201318).\n\nHasker claims that this objection is confused, conflating two quite\ndistinct questions (Hasker 1989:208\u201309). One is a metaphysical\nquestion: What does it mean to say of a person at one time\nthat she is numerically the same person at a later time? (Or, if you\nlike, it is a metaphysical question to ask: Is x at\nt1 the same \u03c6 as y at\nt2?) The second is an epistemological question:\nHow can we tell that a person at one time is numerically the\nsame person at a later time? (Or how can we tell that x at\nt1 is the same \u03c6 as y at\nt2?) The failure to distinguish these questions (a\nfailure which may be due in part to Wittgenstein) is the source of\nserious philosophical confusions. The short answer to the first\nquestion is that normally, when we know what a \u03c6 is, we know also\nwhat it is for a \u03c6 at t1 to be the same\nindividual \u03c6 as a \u03c6 at t2. The abnormal\ncases are those in which the \u03c6 at t1 has\nundergone changes, and we are unsure whether those changes amount to\nthe destruction of the \u03c6, or its replacement by another object, so\nthat the very same \u03c6 cannot possibly have persisted until\nt2. The classic example is the ship of\n Theseus,[1]\n but there are many others. In such cases, our first recourse is to\nseek to understand more accurately the concept of a \u03c6\u2014does\nour concept of a ship, for example, allow for the progressive\nreplacement of all of the ship\u2019s parts, or not? But\nsometimes there may be no determinate answer to this question. Our\nconcepts, after all, have been developed to deal with the sorts of\ncontingencies that normally arise, and it may sometimes be possible to\ninvent scenarios (or even to discover them empirically) that are not\nprovided for in our ordinary usage of a concept. In that case, we must\neither provide for ourselves criteria to cover the novel situation\n(thus modifying our previous concept of a \u03c6), or else admit that\nthe question we were asking has no answer.\n\nWhen we pose this question with regard to the persistence of\nimmaterial souls, what we find is that there is no problem that needs\na solution. We know what it is to be a subject of experience\u2014to\nbe a being that thinks, and believes, and desires various things, for\nexample\u2014and prima facie at least this does not entail\nbeing embodied, let alone being embodied in the very same body over\ntime. If we think of the immaterial soul in Cartesian terms, there\nsimply isn\u2019t anything that can happen to such a soul (barring\nits being no longer sustained in existence by God) that could bring it\nabout that the soul ceases to be; Cartesian souls are \u201cnaturally\nimmortal\u201d. Some other dualist views may not opt for natural\nimmortality of the soul, and if so they will need to say something\nabout the sorts of changes that a soul can and cannot sustain if it is\nto remain in existence as the individual it was. But there is no\nproblem here for the general hypothesis of survival as an immaterial\nsoul (Hasker 1999: 206\u201311).\n\nThe metaphysical question having been disposed of, it becomes apparent\nthat the epistemological question is less significant than it may\nappear to be at first. How do we re-identify immaterial souls over\ntime? Under normal circumstances, we do this by re-identifying the\nembodiment of the soul, but this is not always possible: prior at\nleast to the advent of DNA testing, cases of disputed identity could\nnot always be settled by re-identifying bodies. Sometimes the\nsubject\u2019s memory of events is an important clue, though not of\ncourse an infallible one. But can any tests establish the identity of\na completely non-embodied subject? Evidently, the question of the\nidentity of a non-embodied subject makes sense to some: those who\nconsult spiritualist mediums certainly understand the question,\nwhether they\u2019re conversing with dear departed Aunt Susie, or\nmerely with a manipulative practitioner. But again, once it is seen\nthat there is no metaphysical problem here, the epistemological\nquestion becomes purely a practical one, requiring to be answered if\nand when we have the need in practice to make such\nidentifications.\n\nIt is also worth noting that an objection against individual\ncontinuity in dualism can be deployed against individual continuity in\nmaterialism. One objection (that can be traced back to Kant) against\ndualism is that the dualist is unable to account for the possibility\nthat the soul or immaterial self is constantly being replaced by\ndifferent individual selves, (with complete updated\n\u201cmemories\u201d and psychological qualities) thus creating the\nillusion of personal continuity of the self-same subject. If\nthe self is immaterial, how would we notice the successive changes?\nThis may be called the problem of undetected (and perhaps\nundetectable) soul-switching. This objection faces many obstacles, one\nbeing that we would be unable to properly account for our experience\nof successive states (we hear Big Ben ring three times by first\nhearing it ring twice) if we are not the self-same individuals over\ntime. But more to the point, in terms of continuity, it is logically\npossible that material bodies are switched every nanosecond. If the\nswitch (or annihilation and creation) were done in an instant (as\nopposed to an interval) there would be no duration, no event that\ncould be measured by us that would reveal the switch. If undetectable\nmaterial object-switching is not a problem, then undetectable\nsoul-switching should not be a problem.\n\nThere may still be an objection to a dualist account of an afterlife\nwhich holds that the idea of disembodied survival, even if not\nlogically incoherent, is one we don\u2019t have a sufficient grasp of\nto allow it to count as a real possibility. What would such survival\namount to, anyway? Of course, if the souls of the departed are assumed\nto be fitted out immediately with resurrection bodies, this difficulty\nis greatly alleviated. But if the notion of an immaterial soul is to\ndo any philosophical work, we need to be able to think what it might\nbe like for such a soul to exist on its own, disembodied.\n\nThis challenge has been met in an interesting article by H.H. Price\n(1953). Price spells out, in considerable detail, a notion of\ndisembodied souls existing in a \u201cworld\u201d of something like\ndream-images\u2014images, however, that would be shared between a\nnumber of more or less like-minded, and telepathically interacting,\nsouls. Included among these images would be images of one\u2019s own\nbody and of other people\u2019s bodies, so that one might, at first,\nfind it difficult to distinguish the image-world from the ordinary\nphysical world we presently inhabit. The conception is similar to\nBerkeley\u2019s, except that Price does not invoke God directly as\nthe sustainer of regularities in the image-world. He does say,\nhowever, that \n\n\nif we are theists, we shall hold that the laws of nature, in other\nworlds as in this one, are in the end dependent on the will of a\nDivine Creator. (1953: 390) \n\n\nSomeone who seriously considers Price\u2019s development of this idea\nwill be forced to admit that a sufficiently clear account of what\ndisembodied existence might be like has been proposed. (And for a more\nrecent work that argues that our actual world is idealist in the\ntradition of Berkeley, see Foster 2007.) We need not follow Price (or\nFoster) in (what appears to be) his supposition that this is a\nplausible account of the actual state of persons who have died. It is\nenough if he has provided an account that makes plain the\nintelligibility of the notion of disembodied survival; the believer in\nan afterlife can then say, \u201cIf not in just this way, then in\nsome other\u201d.\n\nIf there is reason to think that mind-body dualism is true, then there\nis reason to think that a person\u2019s survival of death is\nlogically possible. But dualism has come upon hard times lately, and\nis widely regarded as being discredited. Whether or not this is\nwarranted, dualism is undoubtedly subject to a number of objections,\nthough these are not necessarily more severe than the difficulties\nthat attend materialism (see the entry on\n dualism,\n also Koons and Bealer (eds.) 2010). For a positive case for dualism,\nsee Loose, Menuge, & Moreland 2018 (The Blackwell Companion to\nSubstance Dualism). In view of this let us consider also the\npossibility of survival given some form of\n materialism.[2]\n3. Objections to the Possibility of Survival\u2014Materialism\n\nWhat are the prospects for survival on a materialistic view of\npersons? One possible reason for thinking that materialism is not\nhostile to the prospects of an afterlife is that, historically, the\nstandard view of the afterlife in the major theistic traditions is\nthat it involves the resurrection of bodies. While there is a\nlongstanding theological tradition that links belief in bodily\nresurrection with dualism, many theologians and some philosophers\nargue that dualism is a Platonic import into theistic traditions\n(Cullman 1955), and that it is more in keeping with the Hebrew,\nChristian, and Islamic stress on bodily life to understand the\nafterlife in materialist rather than dualist terms.\n\nThe central logical problem for materialist versions of the\nresurrection is personal identity. On dualist assumptions, personal\nidentity is preserved by the persistence of the soul between death and\nresurrection. But for materialism, nothing bridges the\nspatio-temporal gap between the body that perishes and that body\nresurrected. Without such a bridge, how can the\n\u201cresurrected\u201d person be identical with the person who\ndied? Considerable ingenuity has been expended in the search for an\nanswer to this question.\n\nWithout doubt, the most popular materialist option here is the\n\u201cre-creation\u201d theory, according to which, at some time\nafter a person\u2019s death, God re-creates the person by creating a\nbody with the identical characteristics of the body that perished\n(Hick 1983: 125\u201326). While this may seem rather ghastly in cases\nof violent death, there is no reason why God could not correct any\ninjury and renew the body\u2019s youthfulness, and so on. But can\nthis re-creation preserve the necessity of the identity relation (the\nfact that your persistence over time as you is strict and not\ncontingent)? If you are re-created, the \u201cyou\u201d that comes\ninto existence in the re-creation cannot just contingently happen to\nbe you (as if someone else could do the job of being you). One reason\nto suspect that the identity relationship is not preserved (and this\nis not merely an epistemological matter) is that if God could create\none body that is exactly similar to the body that died, why not two or\nmore? It is not a satisfactory answer to this to say that God, being\ngood, would not (and perhaps could not) do such a thing. On the view\nin question, what is necessary for resurrection is merely that\nmaterial particles be arranged in the correct fashion, and it is\nhardly a necessary truth that only God could do this. (Perhaps a\nreally smart rogue angel could pull it off!) Nor is it feasible to\nguarantee uniqueness by requiring that the identical particles present\nin the dead body make up the resurrected body. On the one hand, the\nbody has no doubt shed, during its life, enough particles to make\nseveral bodies, and it is hardly credible that the replacement of one\nof the atoms present at the time of death with an atom shed by the\nbody a few seconds before death would mean we have a different body\n(assuming other requirements to be satisfied). If, on the other hand,\nonly particles from the body at the time of death may be used, there\nare the long-recognized problems about the availability of some of\nthese particles, which within a few years may have made their ways\ninto a large number of other human bodies. In any case there is a\nhard-to-quell intuition that reassembly, no matter how expertly\ncompleted, would at best produce a replica rather than the identical\nbody that perished. Peter van Inwagen offers a compelling example:\n\n\nSuppose a certain monastery claims to have in its possession a\nmanuscript written in St. Augustine\u2019s own hand. And suppose the\nmonks of this monastery further claim that this manuscript was burned\nby Arians in the year 457. It would immediately occur to us to ask how\nthis manuscript, the one we can touch, could be the very\nmanuscript that was burned in 457. Suppose their answer to this\nquestion is that God miraculously recreated Augustine\u2019s\nmanuscript in 458. We should respond to this answer as follows: the\ndeed it describes seems quite impossible, even as an accomplishment of\nomnipotence. God certainly might have created a perfect duplicate of\nthe original manuscript, but it would not be that one; its\nearliest moment of existence would have been after Augustine\u2019s\ndeath; it would never have known the impress of his hand; it would not\nhave been a part of the furniture of the world when he was alive; and\nso on. Now suppose our monks were to reply by simply asserting that\nthe manuscript now in their possession did know the impress\nof Augustine\u2019s hand; that it was a part of the\nfurniture of the world when the Saint was alive; that when God\nrecreated or restored it, God (as an indispensable component of\naccomplishing this task) saw to it that the object God produced had\nall these properties. [para. break in 1978] \n\nWe confess we should not know what to make of this. We should have to\ntell the monks that we did not see how what they believed could\npossibly be true. (van Inwagen 1992: 242\u201343) \n\n\nGiven these difficulties with the re-creation view, attempts have been\nmade to find other ways of accounting for resurrection in materialist\nterms. One of the more interesting of these is Lynne Rudder\nBaker\u2019s invocation of a constitution view of persons (Baker\n2000, 2001, 2005). On this view persons are not identical with, but\nare constituted by, their bodies. (She discusses the constitution\nrelation at considerable length; the details of this are not relevant\nhere.) What is distinctive of persons is a \u201cfirst-person\nperspective\u201d, roughly, the capacity to think of oneself as\noneself. This ability, which humans possess but other animals\nseem to lack, is an essential component of moral responsibility as\nwell as of our ability to plan for the future and to perform many\nother distinctively personal activities and functions. According to\nBaker, the constitution view opens the way for a doctrine of\nresurrection that avoids the difficulties of the re-creation theory.\nSince persons are not identical with their bodies, it need not be\nmaintained that the resurrected body is the same identical body as the\nbody that died. What is required, however, is that the first-person\nperspective of the resurrected body be the same: \u201cif a\nperson\u2019s first-person perspective were extinguished, the person\nwould go out of existence\u201d (2005: 385). So the first-person\nperspective must somehow be transferred from the original body to the\nresurrection body: \n\n\nperson P1 at t1 is the same person as person P2\nat t2 if and only if P1 and P2 have the same\nfirst-person perspective. (2000: 132) \n\n\nBaker holds that there is indeed a fact of the matter as to whether a\ngiven future person has the same first-person perspective as I now\nhave, though there is no \u201cinformative\u201d way of specifying\ncriteria of identity between the two.\n\nAlthough Baker\u2019s account is intriguing, it seems problematic\nwhen one takes a closer look at the idea of a first-person\nperspective. Arguably, to have a first-person perspective, one has to\nbe a person. To have a first-person perspective is to have the\ncapacity to experience things; to act, think, speak, and so on with\nintention. Such acts can in principle be qualitatively identical in\ndifferent thinkers and speakers; what individuates them is the\nperson who\u2019s doing the thinking or speaking. In other\nwords, intentional acts derive their identity from the person\nperforming them. But if this is true of the acts themselves it is also\ntrue of the first-person perspectives, which are nothing but the\ncapacities of various persons to perform such acts. So to say that\nP1 and P2 have the same first-person perspective is just\nto say that P1 and P2 are the same person, and the\ncriterion reduces to a tautology. Regrettably, we have not yet been\ngiven any help in understanding how a person, with her\nfirst-person perspective, can occupy first one body and then\nanother.\n\nAnother proposal is offered by Kevin Corcoran (2005). Corcoran, like\nBaker, is a constitution theorist, but, unlike Baker, he does not\nbelieve persons can be transferred from one body to another. Corcoran\nproposes that the body of a resurrected person does need to be\nidentical with the body of the person when he died. Corcoran advances\nseveral proposals about how this might be possible. The one to be\nnoted here is what might be termed a \u201cbrute force\u201d\nsolution: \n\n\nIf God causes that body to exist once, why could God not cause it to\nexist a second time? \u2026 But what makes the first stage of the\npost-gap body a different stage of the same body that perished is just\nthat God makes it so. (2005: 172) \n\n This comes extremely close to making identity over time a matter\nof convention\u2014divine convention, to be sure, but convention all\nthe same. (It is reminiscent of Jonathan Edwards\u2019 view that we\nare justly punished for Adam\u2019s sin in the Garden of Eden because\nGod has decreed that the segment of Adam\u2019s life including the\nsin is a segment of our own lives also.) It is difficult to measure\nwhen an appeal to divine fiat is philosophically licit or illicit. The\nchallenge facing Corcoran\u2019s position may be similar to the one\nHick faces: how would God distinguish between re-creating the same\nbody that was destroyed earlier and creating an exact duplicate? For a\nrecent treatment of survival from a materialist perspective, see\nMerrick 2022.\n\nWe have left until last van Inwagen\u2019s own proposal for a\nmaterialist resurrection. For in spite of his criticisms of the common\nview, van Inwagen is himself a Christian and a believer in the\nresurrection. Here is his proposal:\n\n\nPerhaps at the moment of each man\u2019s death, God removes his\ncorpse and replaces it with a simulacrum which is what is burned or\nrots. Or perhaps God is not quite so wholesale as this: perhaps He\nremoves for \u201csafekeeping\u201d only the \u201ccore\nperson\u201d\u2014the brain and central nervous system\u2014or even\nsome special part of it. These are details. (van Inwagen 1992:\n245\u201346)\n\n\nContinuity is maintained, then, through the preservation of the body\n(or crucial body-part, such as the brain), and when the time comes for\nresurrection to occur, God restores life to the body in question and\none\u2019s resurrected life can begin. In fairness, it should be\npointed out that van Inwagen originally advanced this proposal only in\norder to demonstrate the logical possibility of a materialist\nresurrection. In this he may well have succeeded. But as a proposal\nthat is supposed to represent the actual way in which God enables\nhumans to live again, the account has very little to recommend it. In\nthis view, God assumes the role of contemporary practitioners of\ncryonics, preserving the dead body until such time as it is revived\nand restored to health. But this is bad news for the actual\npractitioners, since the \u201cbodies\u201d they are preserving are\nmere simulacra and presumably incapable of being revived, even if all\nthe technology functions flawlessly. Furthermore, the feature of the\naccount that makes it unacceptable\u2014that God \u201cspirits\naway\u201d the crucial part of the person\u2019s body, leaving\nbehind a simulacrum\u2014is essential to the view\u2019s success in\ndepicting a possible way of resurrection. In the Author\u2019s Note\nappended in 1992, van Inwagen writes:\n\n\nIf I were writing a paper on this topic today, I should not make the\ndefinite statement \u201cI think this is the only way such a\nbeing could accomplish it\u201d. I am now inclined to think that\nthere may well be other ways, ways that I am unable even to form an\nidea of because I lack the conceptual resources to do so. (1992:\n246)\n\n\nA more recent, and extremely ingenious, account of an afterlife from a\nmaterialist point of view has been proposed by Dean Zimmerman. The\nproposal goes roughly like this: at the instant of death, each\nelementary particle in a person\u2019s body undergoes\n\u201cbudding\u201d in which it produces another particle of the\nsame kind. The newly produced particle takes its place in a\nresurrection body, existing in a resurrection \u201cspace\u201d; at\nthe same time the original particle remains in place as part of the\ncorpse. Since it is the resurrection body, and not the corpse, which\ncontinues the life of the subject, the resurrection body rather than\nthe corpse is the \u201cclosest continuer\u201d of the pre-death\nbody. It is, then, the resurrection body and not the corpse that is\nthe same body as the one that previously lived, and personal identity\nis preserved. This proposal abandons strict (Leibnizian) identity in\nfavor of a \u201cclosest continuer\u201d theory. It also shares an\ninteresting feature with van Inwagen\u2019s account: the remaining\ncorpse is not the same body as the one that previously lived.\n(Zimmerman 1999 and 2010; Hasker 2011). For a critical analysis of\nZimmerman and van Inwagen thought experiments, see Taliaferro &\nKnuths 2017 and Knuths 2018.\n\nIt has not been shown conclusively that an identity-preserving\nmaterialist resurrection is impossible, but the difficulties, as\noutlined above, are formidable (Hasker 1999: 211\u201331). Proponents\nof an afterlife, it seems, would be better served if they were able to\nespouse some variety of mind-body dualism. This entry cannot undertake\nan assessment of the comparative merits of dualism and materialism. It\nis worth noting, however, that recent philosophy has seen an increased\nrecognition in some quarters of the difficulties resulting from\nmaterialist views, and a corresponding interest in different (not\nnecessarily Cartesian) varieties of dualism. (See Koons & Bealer\n(eds.) 2010; Batthyany & Elitzur (eds.) 2009; Loose, Menuge, &\nMoreland 2018; and Lofton 2017.) Given even the apparent coherence of\ndualism in which the person and her body are contingently related\n(metaphysically, it becomes more difficult to argue that it is known\nthat the annihilation of the body entails the annihilation of the\nperson).\n4. Parapsychology and Near-Death Experiences\n\nDuring the heyday of logical positivism in the twentieth century, it\nis interesting that while Moritz Schlick proposed that its demands for\nempirical verification would render propositions about God as\nmeaningless, it would not rule out as meaningless propositions about\nlife after death so long as they involved subjects having experiences.\nInterestingly, some of the most rigid materialists in the last\ncentury, such as Willard Van Orman Quine and Paul Churchland, allowed\nfor the possibility of there being compelling empirical evidence of\nparapsychological powers and even ghosts. In this section, let us\nconsider whether there is empirical support for belief in an\nafterlife.\n\nParapsychology investigates phenomena that are alleged to lie outside\nthe boundaries of ordinary naturalistic explanation. These phenomena\ninclude telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, mediumistic messages,\npossession-type cases, reincarnation-type cases, apparitions, and\nothers. Not all of these phenomena are directly relevant to survival\nand the afterlife, but some of them, if accepted as veridical, do\nprovide such evidence: for instance, messages received through a\nmedium, allegedly from a deceased person, that contain information to\nwhich the medium has no other access.\n\nThe evaluation of this body of evidence is highly contentious. Clearly\nthere exists both motive and opportunity for fraud and fabrication in\nmany cases. It is questionable, though, whether a responsible inquirer\ncan afford to dismiss out of hand all cases that seem to defy ordinary\nnaturalistic explanation. It counts against a sweeping dismissive\napproach that the phenomena have been attested as probably veridical\nby some highly reputable investigators, including such philosophers as\nWilliam James, Henry Sidgwick, C.D. Broad, H.H. Price and John Beloff.\nThese men had little to gain personally by their investigations;\nindeed in undertaking them they endangered already well-established\nreputations. Investigating the subject with finely-honed critical\ninstincts, they have applied stringent tests in selecting instances\nthey consider to be credible, and have rejected many cases they held\nto be fraudulent or inadequately attested.\n\nIf we are willing to give an initial hearing to this evidence, what\nconclusions can reasonably be reached? A conclusion that many (but not\nall) of these investigators would accept is that the evidence provides\nsome, but not conclusive, evidence for personal survival after death\n(Steinkamp 2002). However, the reason why the evidence is deemed\ninconclusive will give little comfort to many afterlife skeptics. The\nreason it is not conclusive is that the experiences are susceptible of\na different explanation if we accept the existence of some rather\nspectacular forms of extra-sensory perception, also known as\n\u201csuper psi\u201d (see Braude 2002). An example is a case in\nwhich a medium received information that apparently was known in its\nentirety to no living person. In order to avoid the conclusion that\nthe information was communicated from the deceased person, the medium\nmust be credited with clairvoyance as well as the ability to integrate\ninformation received telepathically from several different persons.\nC.D. Broad (1953: 114) summarized the situation well: the possibility\nof extra-sensory perception weakens the direct force of the evidence\nfor survival by making possible alternative explanations of that\nevidence. But ESP strengthens the overall case by raising the\nantecedent probability of survival, insofar as it renders problematic\nthe naturalistic view of the human person, which for most\ncontemporaries constitutes the greatest obstacle to belief in\nsurvival.\n\nMore recently, it has been claimed that a superior source of evidence\nlies in so-called \u201cnear-death experiences\u201d (Bailey and\nYates (eds.) 1996). These are experiences of persons who were, or\nperceived themselves to be, close to death; indeed many such persons\nmet the criteria for clinical death. While in this state, they undergo\nremarkable experiences, often taken to be experiences of the world\nthat awaits them after death. Returning to life, they testify to their\nexperiences, claiming in many cases to have had their subsequent lives\ntransformed as a result of the near-death experience. This testimony\nmay seem especially compelling in that (a) large numbers of persons\nreport having had such experiences; (b) the experiences come\nspontaneously to those near death, they are not sought out or\ndeliberately induced; and (c) normally no one stands to benefit\nfinancially from either the experiences or the reports.\n\nThese experiences, furthermore, are not random in their contents.\nThere are recurring elements that show up in many of these accounts,\nforming a general (but far from invariable) pattern. Typical elements\ninclude a sense of being dead, peacefulness and absence of pain;\n\u201cout-of-body experiences\u201d in which the subject views his\nor her own body \u201cfrom outside\u201d and witnesses various\nevents, sometimes at a considerable distance from the location of the\nperson\u2019s body; passing through a dark tunnel towards intense\nlight; meeting \u201cbeings of light\u201d (sometimes including\nfriends and relatives who have died previously); and a \u201clife\nreview\u201d in which the events of one\u2019s life pass before one\nand are subjected to evaluation. The subject may be initially\ndisappointed or reluctant to return to the body, and (as already\nnoted) many testify that the experience has been life-changing,\nleading to a lessened\u2014or even a complete absence of\u2014fear\nof death and other beneficial results.\n\nThese experiences are surprisingly common. A Gallup poll taken in 1982\nfound that eight million Americans (about five percent of the adult\npopulation at that time) had survived a near-death experience (NDE).\nThe experiences occur regardless of age, social class, race, or\nmarital status. Probably the improvements in medical technology, which\nenable many to return from a state of \u201cclinical death\u201d,\nhave increased the numbers in recent times. But NDEs have been\nreported throughout recorded history and from all corners of the\nearth. Since the publication in 1975 of Raymond Moody\u2019s book,\nLife After Life (1975), there have been numerous studies of\nthe phenomenon, some of them carried out with careful attention to\nscientific objectivity (e.g., Ring 1980; Sabom 1982; van Lommel et\nal. 2001).\n\nAs one might expect, there is a wide variety of interpretations of\nNDEs, from those that interpret the experiences as literally revealing\na state that lies beyond death to interpretations that attempt to\ndebunk the experiences by classifying them as mere reflections of\nabnormal brain states. Clearly, there is no one medical or\nphysiological cause; the experiences occur for persons in a great\nvariety of medical conditions. An interesting counterexample to\nexplanations in terms of the \u201cdying brain\u201d is found in the\nNDEs experienced by mountain climbers in the midst of what they\nexpected to be fatal falls (Heim 1892); it is hardly credible that\nthese experiences can be reduced to either drugs or oxygen\ndeprivation.\n\nOn the other hand, interpretations of NDEs as literally revelatory of\nthe life to come, though common in the popular literature, are\nextremely questionable. Carol Zaleski has shown, through her\ncomparative studies of medieval and modern NDEs, that many features of\nthese experiences vary in ways that correspond to cultural\nexpectations (Zaleski 1987). A striking instance of this is the\nminimal role played by judgment and damnation in modern NDEs; unlike\nthe medieval cases, the modern life-review tends to be therapeutic\nrather than judgmental in emphasis. In view of this, Zaleski ascribes\nthe experiences to the religious imagination, insisting that to do so\nenhances rather than diminishes their significance. Claims of\ncross-cultural invariance in modern NDEs are also questionable. The\nmajority of the research has been done in cultures where Christianity\nis the predominant religious influence, but research done in other\ncultures reveals significantly different patterns. One amusing\ndifference occurs in the episodes in which it is decided that the\nexperiencer will return to embodied life rather than remaining in the\nafterworld. In Western NDEs there is often a \u201cspirit\nguide\u201d who counsels the experiencer that it is better that he or\nshe should return to life. In India, on the other hand, the person is\noften turned back with the information that there has been a clerical\nerror in the paperwork, so that it was by mistake that he or she came\nto this point! (K. Augustine 2008,\n Other Internet Resources,\n see the section on \u201cCultural Differences\u201d).\n\nThe causation of these experiences is problematic. Some aspects of the\nexperience have been deliberately induced by the administration of\ndrugs (see Jansen 1997); this demonstrates that such phenomena can be\nproduced by chemical alterations to the brain, but in most NDE cases\nno such chemical causes can be identified. Several researchers have\nconcluded that the triggering cause of the NDE is simply the perceived\nnearness of death. (NDEs have also been experienced by persons who\nbelieved they were close to death but were not in fact in any\nlife-threatening situation (K. Augustine 2008,\n Other Internet Resources,\n see the section on Pam Reynolds).) The specific content of NDEs can\nbe divided into mundane content, in which what is experienced\nis or resembles typical features of the ordinary world, and\ntranscendental content, portraying \u201canother\nrealm\u201d quite unlike the world of ordinary experience. The source\nof the transcendental content is problematic, though the cultural\nvariations suggest that a significant role must be assigned to\ncultural expectations concerning the afterlife.\n\nFinally, there is what Gary Habermas has termed the\nevidential aspect of NDEs. These are phenomena that, provided\nthey can be verified, would indicate strongly that something is\noccurring that is not susceptible of an ordinary naturalistic\nexplanation. This might seem to be the most helpful direction to look\nif the aim is to arrive at an objectively compelling assessment of\nNDEs. If it should turn out to be possible to verify objectively\ncertain paranormal aspects of NDEs, fully naturalistic explanations\ncould be ruled out and the way would be open for further exploration\nconcerning the meaning of the experiences. On the other hand, if all\nsuch evidential aspects could be fully explained in terms of ordinary\nnatural processes, the claim of NDEs to be revelatory of anything\nmetaphysically significant would be greatly weakened.\n\nEvidential aspects of NDEs fall into several categories. First, there\nare out-of-body sensory experiences, in which patients, often while\ncomatose, observe accurately features to which they have no access\nthrough normal sensory channels. In one case, an eight-year-old girl\nwho nearly drowned required 45 minutes of CPR to restore her\nheartbeat:\n\n\nIn the meantime, she said that she floated out of her body and visited\nheaven. Additionally \u2026 she was able to totally and correctly\nrecount the details from the time the paramedics arrived in her yard\nthrough the work performed later in the hospital emergency room.\n(Moreland and Habermas 1998: 159)\n\n\nSecond, there are accounts of sensory experiences which accurately\nreport events that occurred during periods in which the\nsubject\u2019s heart had stopped, and even during \u201cflat\nEEG\u201d periods in which there was no detectable brain activity.\nFinally, there are \u201csurprise encounters\u201d during the NDE\nwith friends and relatives who had in fact recently died, but where\nthe subject had no knowledge of this prior to the time of the\nexperience. Here the crucial question would be, Where did the subject\nobtain knowledge of the other person\u2019s death? If ordinary\nchannels of communication can be ruled out, the most natural\nconclusion would seem to be that this knowledge was obtained from the\ndeceased person, who is somehow still alive.\n\nAll of these claims concerning the evidential value of NDEs have been\ncalled into question. One of the most thorough discussions is by Keith\nAugustine\n (Other Internet Resources,\n 2008), who draws on work by a large number of other researchers. As\nnoted already, there is overwhelming evidence that NDEs do not provide\na literal experience of conditions in the afterlife; this is attested,\namong other things, by the considerable variations in these\nexperiences in different times and different cultures. Also relevant\nhere is the fact that similar experiences sometimes happen to persons\nwho mistakenly believe themselves to be in life-threatening\ncircumstances. Apparently it is the perceived nearness to\ndeath, rather than the actual proximity of the afterworld, that\ntriggers the experiences. The encounters with persons recently\ndeceased, but whose deaths were previously unknown to the experiencer,\nbecome somewhat less impressive once it is recognized that\nstill-living persons may also be encountered in NDEs (\u201cLiving\nPersons\u201d). These still-living persons were otherwise occupied at\nthe time of the NDEs; they cannot have been literally present in the\nother-worldly realm in which they were encountered. And given that\nstill-living persons can appear in NDEs, it becomes statistically\nprobable that on occasion there will also be encounters with persons\nwho have recently died but whose death was unknown to the\nexperiencer.\n\nClaims that NDEs occurred during periods with no brain activity are\ncountered by the rejoinder that an EEG may not reveal all activity\nwithin the brain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, for example,\ncan reveal activity that is missed by an EEG. In cases where brain\nactivity has indeed ceased for a given patient, the NDE may have\noccurred either before the cessation or after normal brain activity\nhas resumed; it is not necessary to assume that the NDE and the\nbrain\u2019s non-activity were simultaneous (\u201cLiving\nPersons\u201d). With respect to the claim of information that was\nlearned during the NDE that was not otherwise available, various\nanswers are possible. It is noted, first of all, that\ninaccurate \u201cinformation\u201d is often reported\n(\u201cOut-of-Body Discrepancies\u201d). In some cases where the\ninformation is confirmed, we may be dealing with subsequent\nenhancement as a result of the repeated recital of the story. (This\nneed not involve deliberate deception; it is a common experience that\nstories often repeated tend to gain new features of interest in the\ntelling.) In other cases, it is argued that the information was in\nfact available through ordinary sensory channels, often through the\nexperiencer\u2019s hearing of things said during a medical procedure\nwhen they were apparently unconscious and unresponsive. (There is\nconsiderable evidence that \u201cunconscious\u201d persons do hear\nand register things said when they are apparently oblivious to their\nsurroundings.) (\u201cVeridical Paranormal Perception During\nOBEs?\u201d) However, it is worth noting that Augustine makes little\neffort to establish that the factors cited in his naturalistic\nexplanations were actually operative in the various NDE cases. It\nwould appear to be his view that the burden of proof lies almost\nentirely on the shoulders of those who make claims on behalf of the\nevidential value of NDEs.\n\nWith regard to this entire body of evidence, both from parapsychology\nand from NDEs, we may be close to an impasse. Those who support the\nevidential value of the experiences will argue that the naturalistic\nexplanations that have been offered are not adequate, that they\ndisplay excessive skepticism towards well-confirmed accounts, and are\nin many instances highly speculative. Those who reject the evidential\nvalue of these phenomena (including some believers in the afterlife)\nwill argue that the evidence is insufficient to warrant the\nextraordinary claims that are made, that the naturalistic explanations\nwork well overall, and that a full explanation of the most puzzling\ncases would require a detailed knowledge of the events and surrounding\ncircumstances that in many cases is not available to us. Further\ncareful research on individual cases may offer some hope of progress,\nbut it seems unlikely that the fundamental disagreements can be\nresolved, especially when the different viewpoints are supported by\ndiverse worldviews. For a thoughtful treatment of NDEs and the\nparanormal as evidence for an afterlife, see Lund 2009 (Part II).\n5. Metaphysical Considerations Concerning Survival\n\nLeaving aside such empirical evidence, what general metaphysical\nconsiderations are relevant to belief in survival? While some\nphilosophers have sought to marginalize metaphysics (see, for example,\nHadot 1995), such deflationary accounts have been found wanting by\nmany philosophers (see, for example, Wynn 2020). We have already seen\nthat a materialist account of persons creates some serious\nobstacles. As van Inwagen and others have argued, God could bring\nabout an afterlife for persons in a way consistent with a materialist\nphilosophy of mind. But in the absence of God, a materialist,\nnaturalist worldview seems not at all promising for survival. As noted\nearlier, mind-body dualism would offer some support for the\npossibility of survival but dualism by no means guarantees survival;\nthe old arguments from the simplicity and alleged indestructibility of\nsouls are out of favor. As Kant observed, a \u201csimple\u201d soul,\nwhich cannot be dissolved into its constituent parts, might still fade\naway gradually until it has completely disappeared. What often is not\nsufficiently appreciated, however, is the close tie between theism and\nbelief in an afterlife. The point is not merely that theistic\nreligions incorporate belief in an afterlife which many persons accept\nbecause of this religious context. The tie is closer than that, and it\nhas considerable force in both directions.\n\nSuppose, on the one hand, that the God of theism does in fact exist.\nAccording to theism, God is both all-powerful and perfectly good, and\nthis goodness is supposed to be of a sort that is relevant to the\nwelfare of human beings (and other rational creatures, if there are\nany). Indeed, this is not merely a speculative assumption; there are\nBiblical texts proclaiming that God is a God of love. If there is\nreason to believe that God loves created persons, then it is highly\nplausible to believe that God desires to provide creatures with the\nopportunity for a greater, and longer-lasting, fulfillment than is\npossible within the brief scope of earthly existence. This is\nespecially true, one would think, for those who, through no fault of\ntheir own, find their lives blighted by disease, or accident, or war,\nor any of the other natural or anthropogenic disasters to which we are\nvulnerable. And yet even those of us who enjoy relatively good and\nsatisfying lives are conscious of far, far more that could be\naccomplished and enjoyed, given more time and the vigor and energy to\nuse it well.\n\nThis argument can also be reversed to telling effect. If there is no\nafterlife, no realm in which the sorrows of this life can be assuaged\nand its injustices remedied, then it may be argued that the problem of\nevil becomes impossible to solve in any rationally intelligible way.\nArguably, a perfectly good and all-powerful God would not make a\ncosmos in which all or most created persons have lives that are full\nof misery and then are annihilated; nor would an all-loving good God\ncreate a cosmos in which there is no opportunity for transformation\nbeyond this life. That is not to say, of course, that allowing for an\nafterlife makes the problem of evil easy for theists\u2014that is far\nfrom being the case. But it does provide a way in which this\nlife\u2019s injustices can be seen as not having had the last\nword\u2014victims in this life do not have to be eternally victims\nand those who\u2019ve done evil won\u2019t get away with it. For\nthese reasons, one would be hard pressed to find very many theists (as\nopposed to deists) who do not also affirm belief in an afterlife.\n\nThe close connection between theism and an afterlife is affirmed in\nKant\u2019s arguments for the \u201cpostulates of practical\nreason\u201d. To be sure, Kant gives different reasons for\npostulating God and for postulating an afterlife, and the ends to be\nserved by these postulations are ostensibly different. In actuality,\nhowever, it is highly plausible that the two postulates are\ninseparable. We ought to postulate God, because only in this way is it\npossible that in the end happiness should be enjoyed by persons in\nproportion to their moral worthiness. Given the actual conditions of\nthe present life, it is evident that this end can be secured, if at\nall, only in a future existence. We are told to postulate immortality,\nbecause only an endless life makes possible continued progress towards\nthe goal of a coincidence of one\u2019s will with the requirements of\nthe moral law. But for such continued progress to be at all likely to\noccur would seem to require some kind of morally benign conditions in\nthe afterlife, and Kant implicitly assumes that such conditions will\nobtain.\n\nWhat about an argument in the opposite direction: if it is reasonable\nto believe in an afterlife, is it more reasonable to believe in\ntheism? Given the reasonability of believing in an afterlife, it would\nbe more reasonable to believe that theism is true rather than\nmaterialistic naturalism, but the reasonability of theism would have\nto be weighed in the context of non-theistic philosophies and\nreligions that include belief in an afterlife. Nontheistic Hinduism\nand Buddhism include beliefs about an afterlife; in these religious\ntraditions, belief in an afterlife is part of their understanding of\ncosmic justice, a system in which one\u2019s reincarnation (and,\nultimately, one\u2019s enlightenment and liberation) depends on\none\u2019s Karma. These, and other traditions such as Jainism,\ninvolve matters that are addressed in other entries in the SEP, but we\noffer here a modest observation on how the evidence for a good\nafterlife (an afterlife that is in accord with some morally sound\norder) might lend more support for one religion or philosophy than\nanother.\n\nImagine that we have good reason to believe (or we possess Kantian\njustification for faith) that the cosmos is ultimately ordered in a\njust and moral manner (felicity and virtue will be in concord, and the\nwicked will not flourish indefinitely and so on). Imagine further that\nwe can limit the most plausible accounts of such a moral order on the\nbasis of either traditional theistic accounts of the afterlife or a\nsystem of reincarnation in which Karma is at work determining\nsuccessive re-births until enlightenment\u2014liberation. Robin\nCollins has argued that the second alternative faces what he calls the\n\u201ckarma management problem\u201d. He writes,\n\n\nTraditionally Buddhists have believed that by and large the\ncircumstances of one\u2019s rebirth are determined by one\u2019s\nkarma\u2014that is, one\u2019s deeds, whether good or bad in this\nand previous lives. This, however, seems to require that there exist\nsomething like a \u201cprogram\u201d that arranges your genes, the\nfamily conditions you are born into, and the like to correspond to the\nmoral worth of your past deeds (Collins 1999: 206).\n\n\nFor theists, such as many (but not all) Hindus, this minute\narrangement of one\u2019s life circumstances to match one\u2019s\nkarma can be viewed as the work of God. So long as we recognize the\nintelligibility of divine agency, the \u201cmanagement\u201d of\nreincarnation should in principle be no more difficult to accept than\nany other theistic explanations. But in the absence of theistic,\nintentional explanations, how would a \u201ckarma program\u201d\nwork, and how was it initiated? We know today, by means that were not\navailable to the ancient Hindus and Buddhists, that\n\u201cnature\u201d\u2014the nature that is known and studied in the\nnatural sciences\u2014simply doesn\u2019t work this way. The laws of\nnature are subtle and marvelously complex (though also, in their own\nway, \u201csimple\u201d), but it is abundantly clear that they do\nnot work in such a way as to determine physical situations in\naccordance with the moral worth of persons, or in accordance with any\nmoral considerations whatsoever. The laws of nature, we might say, are\nno respecters of persons\u2014or of morality. Rather, they are\nimpersonal in character, and in many cases are expressible in\nmathematical formulae that are far removed from the teleology that\npermeates human existence. So if there is a \u201ckarmic moral\norder\u201d of the sort postulated by the Indian traditions, it must\nbe something radically different from the order of nature that (so far\nas science can discern) governs the physical processes of the world.\nAnd yet the two orders must be intimately related, for it is precisely\nthese physical processes which, in the end, are said to be disposed in\naccordance with one\u2019s karma. It is wholly implausible that two\ndiverse systems of cosmic order such as this should arise from\nunrelated sources and come together accidentally; they must, then,\nhave a common source. If the common source of the natural order and\nthe karmic order is impersonal, we are still in need of some account\nof how and why it would be such as to produce these two quite\ndifferent sorts of order in the cosmos. These questions, it would\nseem, are much more readily answered if we postulate a\npersonal source of both the natural and the moral\norder\u2014that is to say, a God who desired that there be created\npersons, and who wished to provide a stable natural order within which\nthey could live and exercise their varied powers.\n\nThis is of course a mere sketch of an argument that would require much\nmore space for its full development. We offer the above line of\nreasoning as an example of how one might compare the merits of\nalternative accounts of an afterlife. It is also offered to make the\npoint that the case for or against an afterlife is best understood in\nlight of one\u2019s overall metaphysics. To see further how\nphilosophical reflection on an afterlife might be guided by\nmetaphysical considerations, consider briefly what has been called the\nargument from desire. Without question, many persons strongly desire\nthat there should be an afterlife and believe in one largely if not\nentirely for that reason. It is also beyond question that most\nphilosophers would regard this as a classic case of wishful thinking.\nBut this conclusion is too hasty; indeed, it commits the fallacy of\nbegging the question. To be sure, if the universe is naturalistic,\nthen the desire that many persons have for an afterlife does not\nconstitute any kind of evidence that an afterlife exists. One might\ninquire about the causes of such a desire and, given its widespread\noccurrence, might wonder about its possible Darwinian survival value.\nBut no evidential weight would attach to the desire on the assumption\nof naturalism.\n\nSuppose, on the other hand, that theism (or some view close to theism)\nis true. On this supposition, human life is not the accidental product\nof mindless forces that have operated with no thought to it or to\nanything else. On the contrary, human life (and the life of other\nrational creatures, if there are any) is the product of an\nevolutionary process, which was itself designed to produce such\nbeings, by a God who loves them and cares for them. If this is so,\nthen there is a strong case to be made that desires which are\nuniversal, or near-universal, among human beings are desires for which\nsatisfaction is possible. The inference does not amount to a\ncertainty; it is possible that humans have distorted God\u2019s\npurpose for them, and certainly human conceptions of the way in which\ncertain desires could be satisfied may be wide of the mark. But the\npresumption must be that desires that are widespread or universal are\naimed at some genuine and attainable good, however inadequate the\nconceptions of that good held by many individuals may be. And if this\nis so, persons who take the desire for an afterlife as a reason to\nbelieve in one are on the side of right reason in doing so. Only if\none assumes from the outset that the universe is not human-friendly\ncan the charge of wishful thinking be sustained. In a recent\ncontribution, Johan Eddebo (2017) argues that because we do not know\nthat we are not in a human-friendly universe we cannot rationally rule\nout the possibility of an afterlife for human persons. \n\nA great many persons who believe in life after death do so because of\nreasons that are internal to their own religious traditions. Hindus\nand Buddhists have their accounts of persons who remember in detail\nevents of their previous lives. Jews will rely on the visions of\nEzekiel and the traditions of the rabbis; Muslims on the prophecies of\nthe Koran. Christians will think of the resurrection of Jesus. Whether\nany of these appeals has serious evidentiary force is a question that\ncannot be pursued within the scope of this article; they must all the\nsame be included in any overall assessment of the rationality of\nbelief in an afterlife. Some recent philosophical work on the\nafterlife takes up issues that go beyond this entry. For example, if\nthere is a heaven would persons (souls) have free will? Would they\nhave lives that are dynamic (subject to change) or static or\nchangeless? What might individual cognition be like in paradise? Would\nthere be suffering in paradise? Given the basic teachings of the\nAbrahamic faiths, is there reason to believe that some nonhuman\nanimals enjoy an afterlife? For engaging work on such questions, see\nByerly & Silverman (eds.) 2017.\n",
