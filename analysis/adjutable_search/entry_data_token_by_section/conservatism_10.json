He rejected his utilitarian precursors\u2019\nreforming radicalism:\n\n\nWhen all relevant facts are taken into consideration [he holds] it\nwill scarcely ever be right on Utilitarian grounds for a Utilitarian\nopenly to break or to recommend others to break the rules of morality\ncommonly accepted in his society. (Broad 1930: 157; see also Collini\n1992)\n\n\nSidgwick\u2019s position has been described as a utilitarianism\n\u201cgrown sleek and tame\u201d, as it uses Bentham\u2019s\nprinciples to justify those of Burke (Boucher and Vincent 2012: 30).\nSidgwick\u2019s The Elements of Politics (1891) exhibits an\nintellectual and political conservatism, notably its rejection of\nthen-popular social evolutionary approaches; as Collini argues, though\nsympathetic to socialism, he was drawn to an idiosyncratic variety of\nconservatism\u2014somewhat perhaps as Ruskin and William Morris were\n(Collini 1992; see also Kloppenberg 1992). F.H. Hayward notes, with\nexasperation, that rather than insisting\n\n\nthat Sidgwick should be classified as this or that\u2026it is\nextremely difficult to classify him at all. (Hayward in Schultz ed.\n1992: 5)\n\n\nAn important issue that connects the conservatism of Hume, Burke,\nSidgwick is what people have reason to expect over time. Suppose one\nholds that justice requires X, but that people have long been\ndoing Y, which is incompatible with X, and have entered\ninto life-plans that assume that Y is how things are. If one\ntries to make society more just by preventing people doing Y,\nthat in itself is an unjust action. Hence what Feinberg called\nSidgwick\u2019s paradox of conservative justice (Sidgwick 2011:\nIII.5). As Feinberg writes, insofar as our institutions depart from\nRawls\u2019s basic principles of justice, we have a duty, he says, to\nwork toward their reform. But in our actual imperfect world\n\n\nEvery reform of an imperfect practice or institution is likely to be\nunfair to someone \u2026To change the rules in the middle of the\ngame, even when those rules were not altogether fair, will disappoint\nthe honest expectations of those whose prior commitments and life\nplans were made in genuine reliance on the\u2026old rules. The\npropriety of changing the rules in a given case depends upon\n(inter alia) the degree of unfairness of the old rules and\nthe extent and degree of the reliance placed upon them\u2026we must\nweigh quite legitimate incompatible claims against each other in\ncircumstances such that whichever judgment is reached it will be\nunfair to someone or other (Feinberg 1973: 268). \n\n\nRawls admits that intuitive balancing is unavoidable in dealing with\nproblems of non-ideal theory, but Feinberg finds in his work little\nacknowledgment of the implications of Sidgwick\u2019s paradox.\n\nMichael Oakeshott (1901\u201390) was the last major exponent of the\nIdealist tradition, which enjoyed a period of eminence in Anglophone\nphilosophy in the later 19th and early 20th\ncentury. He has been regarded as a liberal (Franco 2004), while others\nclaim him for the afore-mentioned maverick right (Anderson 1992: 7).\nBut Oakeshott is generally regarded as the most important modern\nconservative. His principal target is what he calls\n\u201cRationalism\u201d, a position shared by liberals and\nsocialists, which aims to achieve ends laid down by blueprint:\n\n\nthe conservative will have nothing to do with innovations designed to\nmeet merely hypothetical situations; he will\u2026delay a\nmodification of the rules until it is clear that the change of\ncircumstances it is designed to reflect has come to stay\u2026he\nwill be suspicious of\u2026rulers who demand extra-ordinary powers\nin order to make great changes and whose utterances are tied to\ngeneralities like \u201cthe public good\u201d or \u201csocial\njustice\u201d. (Oakeshott 1991: 127)\n\n\nIn opposing rationalist planning, Oakeshott argues that the\nconservative disposition is not \u201cconnected with any particular\nbeliefs\u2026about the world in general or about the human\ncondition\u201d, nor \u201cwith moral right and wrong, it is not\ndesigned to make men good or even better\u2026\u201d (Ashford 1990:\n43). He follows the logic of conservative pessimism, preferring\n\u201cfamiliarity over perfection, the tried over the untried, and\nthe actual over the possible\u201d; \u201cstability is more\nprofitable than improvement\u2026agreed error is superior to\ncontroversial truth\u201d (Oakeshott 1991: 169\u2013170). He\ncontrasted a state that has an economy, with a state effectively\nreduced to an economy, and bemoaned the domination of politics by the\npursuit of economic growth as opposed to the good life.\n\nThese are very Burkean themes. As Gray puts it,\n\n\nFor Oakeshott, human knowledge is not the mother of practice, but only\nits stepchild\u2026an exfoliation from [practices] that we have\ninherited\u2026When we theorise our practices, we are discerning\ncoherences within them, not imposing from without any set of abstract\nprinciples. (Gray 2007, Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nIn his book of essays Rationalism in Politics (1991),\nOakeshott is concerned with how the rationalist conception of\nknowledge has operated to the detriment of practice. This conception\nof knowledge holds that all genuine knowledge can be expressed\nentirely in propositional terms, in a theoretical system, or a set of\nrules or maxims. Oakeshott holds that in the modern world, the\nresulting instrumental rationality has penetrated inappropriate areas\nsuch as law, education and the arts\u2014his thought thus\ninterestingly parallels that of Critical Theorists such as Adorno, and\nalso Heidegger. Means-end thinking concerning the state is\nparticularly inappropriate, as we have no choice but to belong to it,\nOakeshott maintains. In an important statement, Oakeshott regards\npolitics as an \u201cart\u201d not a \u201cscience\u201d:\n\n\nPolitics is not the science of setting up a permanently impregnable\nsociety, it is the art of knowing where to go next in the exploration\nof an already existing traditional kind of society. (\u201cThe\nPolitical Economy of Freedom\u201d, in Oakeshott 1991: 406)\n\n\n\u201cIdealism\u201d and \u201crationalism\u201d tend to be\n\u201cutopian\u201d, and thus require uniformity and conformity, and\ndeny individuality and originality, he believes; they do not recognise\nthat members of society desire different ends. Oakeshott attacks\n\u201cthe ideological style of politics\u201d, which pursues an\n\u201cabstract idea\u201d blind to the society\u2019s actual\narrangements and their moral and emotional\n\u201cintimations\u201d\u2014\u201cmen in a hurry\u201d who wish\nto plan and mobilise. Ideologists make everything political, but\npolitics is only a part of human life, he holds.\n\nFor Oakeshott, civil associations are fundamental to modern, free\ndemocracies, and opposed to the modern interventionist state.\nEnterprise associations, in contrast, are defined by a common purpose;\nsociety is not one of them. This distinction reflects another between\n\u201cintellectual\u201d\u2014expressing \u201crationalism\u201d\nin politics\u2014and \u201cpractical\u201d. Politics, for\nOakeshott, belongs to the mode of practice, along with religion and\nmorality; the two other modes are science and history. As well as\nattacking \u201crationalists\u201d, who have a rational plan and\nbelieve in abstract rights, Oakeshott also criticised\n\u201cempiricists\u201d, who claim to be pragmatic, rejecting\ntradition in favour of mere reaction to events. We again see that\nconservatism, although a practical standpoint that appeals to\nexperience, does not rest on philosophical empiricism.\n\nOakeshott is a Burkean particularist sceptic, for whom politics\nconcerns people developing ways of living together in light of their\nhistory and traditions, not driven by universal extrinsic goals such\nas equality or elimination of poverty:\n\n\nIn political activity\u2026men sail a boundless and bottomless sea:\nthere is neither harbour for shelter nor floor for anchorage, neither\nstarting-place nor appointed destination. The enterprise is to keep\nafloat on an even keel\u2026 (1991: 127)\n\n\nThe nautical image had been popularised by Neurath, but is found in\nconservative thought at least as early as Schiller, whose Letters\non Aesthetic Education Of Man (1990 [1794]) referred to the\n\u201cclock\u201d of society that cannot be stopped for repairs:\n\n\nWhen the mechanic has to mend a watch, he lets the wheels run out, but\nthe living watchworks of the state have to be repaired while they act,\nand a wheel has to be exchanged for another during its revolutions.\n(Aesthetic Education, Letter 3)\n\n\nConservatives do not believe any general purpose for government can be\ngiven, beyond \u201ckeeping the enterprise afloat\u201d. This is not\nthe substantive purpose of an enterprise association; rather,\n\u201ckeeping afloat\u201d is the thin commonality of purpose that\ncharacterises a civil association. As Graham writes, \u201cthe only\npurpose [conservatives] are prepared to accept is too vague to\ndetermine any actual activity\u201d (1986: 185); historical context\ndetermines the criteria of successful government.\n\nOakeshott argues that \u201cconservatism is not a creed or a\ndoctrine, but a disposition\u201d to enjoy the present (\u201cOn\nBeing a Conservative\u201d)\u2014part of human nature, not an\nabstract political idea or ideal, let alone an ideology. Though he was\na philosopher not a political theorist, Oakeshott denies that he is a\n\u201cconservative philosopher\u201d; philosophy is theoretical, a\n\u201ctheory of theories\u201d, while conservatism is practical\n(Minogue 2009). However, Gamble adds, that disposition gains substance\nfrom its connection with national ways of life and traditions:\n\n\nFor Oakeshott, the past conceived in this way is intensely liberating\nbecause it is a repository of a wealth of practical knowledge, which\nis needed to live the good life. (Gamble 2012: 163)\n\n\nBut Oakeshott stresses that one must, through education in its\nhistory, be \u201creleased\u201d from slavish commitment to\none\u2019s tradition, and then return to it newly enriched and\ninformed. For him, conversation is the model of education.\n\nIt has been argued that in his later work, Oakeshott\u2019s\njustifications for the conservative disposition developed in a liberal\ndirection (Franco 2004). While the scepticism of Rationalism in\nPolitics aims to protect tradition, \u201cOn Being\nConservative\u201d cites the human disposition to individuality. In a\nposition reminiscent of J.S. Mill, Oakeshott argued empirically that\npeople want to pursue their own life plans, and it is for this reason\nthat governing ought to provide \u201cgeneral rules of conduct\u201d\nand not \u201cplans for imposing substantive activity\u201d (1991:\n424). Unlike many (non-Millian) liberals, however, Oakeshott does not\nbase his requirement of limited government in an abstract theory of\nhuman nature, and abstract rights.\n\nOther notable 20th century conservative thinkers include\nhistorian Maurice Cowling and philosopher Anthony Quinton. Probably\nthe leading living conservative thinker is Roger Scruton, who bases\nconservatism on three concepts: authority, allegiance and tradition\n(Scruton 1980: 27). He rejects post-Hobbesian contractualism, which\npresupposes\n\n\nshared institutions and a conception of human freedom which could not\nhave their origin in a social contract which they serve to make\npossible. (1980: 30)\n\n\nScruton compares the bond of society to\n\n\nthe behaviour of children towards their parents\u2026a bond that is\n\u2018transcendent\u2019 [and] outside the sphere of individual\nchoice. (1980: 32)\n\n\nHence conservatism\u2019s structuring concept of tradition, and its\ndeference to historical, non-state institutions, Burke\u2019s\n\u201clittle platoons\u201d in civil society, including family,\ncommunity and church. Scruton called his The Meaning of\nConservatism \u201ca somewhat Hegelian defence of Tory values in\nthe face of their betrayal by the free marketeers\u201d. It is only\nsomewhat Hegelian, because for Burkean conservatives, history lacks\nthe moral or spiritual direction that Hegel discerned; there is no\nmoral or spiritual progress, and people think collectively toward a\ncommon goal only during a crisis such as war.\n",
