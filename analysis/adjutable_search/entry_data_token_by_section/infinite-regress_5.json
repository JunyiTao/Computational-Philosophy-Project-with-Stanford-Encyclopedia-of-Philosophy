Regress and Global and Local Explanation\n\nDistinguish between a local explanation of the \\(F\\)-ness of\nsome particular \\(X\\) and a global explanation of why there\nare any things that are \\(F\\) at all. Some philosophers have argued\nthat when we have an infinite regress, with the \\(F\\)-ness of each\n\\(X\\) being accounted for by appeal to another \\(X\\) that is \\(F\\),\nthen we do indeed lack a global explanation of why there are\nthings that are \\(F\\), but we nevertheless have a local explanation\nfor each of the infinitely many \\(X\\)s as to why it is \\(F\\).\n(This seems to be the position of Hume\u2019s Cleanthes in Part IX of\nHume 1779.)\n\nRicki Bliss, e.g., speaking of the infinite regress of ontologically\ndependent entities, says (2013, 408): \u201cIn a reality that\nadmitted of no foundations \u2026 although everything has its\nreality accounted for in terms of that upon which it depends, we have\nfailed to explain how the whole lot of them\u2014everything\u2014has\nany reality at all.\u201d Compare to the infinite borrowers case: for\nany given instance of someone having received a bag of sugar, we can\nexplain where that bag of sugar came from: it came from the next\nperson in the chain. But what we can\u2019t explain is a global fact\nabout the series as a whole: why is this bag of sugar in the series in\nthe first place?\n\nBut Bliss argues that it is not necessarily a mark against infinitely\ndescending chains of ontological dependence that it leaves this global\nfact\u2014why does anything have being in the first\nplace?\u2014unexplained. She says (ibid.):\n\n\n[T]he regress is not designed to answer this question. All the regress\ncan tell us is how each individual member has the property under\nconsideration, namely, in dependence upon something else. The\nappearance of an infinite regress should not lead us to conclude that\nnothing within the regress has the property under\nconsideration\u2014nor has its possession of that property\nunexplained\u2014but rather that not everything about the possession\nof the property that needs to be explained has been.\n\n\nContra Leibniz and Schaffer, then, Bliss rejects the idea that in an\ninfinitely descending chain of ontological dependence, being would\nnever be achieved. Having a property dependent on some\ncondition is nevertheless to have that property, so there is no\npressure, she argues, to conclude that nothing in the infinite series\nwould exist. Rather, they all exist, and the existence of each is\nperfectly well accounted for: it exists because the next thing in the\nsequence does. Everything has its being merely on some condition, but\nthe condition is always met. Why there is an infinite chain of\nexisting entities at all is not accounted for, but Bliss says it is a\nmistake to think that the regress was ever supposed to account for\nthat.\n\nBliss concludes that whether or not an ontological infinite regress is\nvicious or benign depends on what we set out to give an account of. If\nall we want is an account of why each thing exists, then it is benign;\nbut if we want an account of why there are things at all, it is\n vicious.[12]\n She says (ibid., 414):\n\n\nIf \\(x\\) is grounded in \\(y\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(z\\), [and so on ad\ninfinitum] and all that we are seeking for is an explanation of\nhow or why \\(x\\) exists (as the thing that it is), an explanation of\nhow or why \\(y\\) exists, and so on ad infinitum, the regress\nis benign. Why? Because where \\(z\\) explains \\(y\\) and \\(y\\) explains\n\\(x\\) our explanans and explanandum are not\nof the same form. In order to explain facts about my existence, we can\nmake recourse to the existence of\u2014or facts of the existence\nof\u2014my parents, my vital organs, etc. In order to explain these\nfacts, we make recourse to further facts, and so on. At each stage, we\nhave a satisfactory explanation of that for which we are seeking one .\n. .\n\nThe regress is not benign, however, if what we are seeking an\nexplanation for is how anything exists, or has being, at all. For even\nat infinity, what the regress shows is that we have not explained\nwhere existence comes from. Even at infinity, we are still invoking\nthings that exist in order to explain how anything exists at\nall\u2026 We encounter, at each level, the explanatory failure\ncharacteristic of a vicious infinite regress: existents whose\nexistence we seek an explanation for are explained in terms of\nexistents. The existence of \\(y\\) may explain the existence of \\(x\\)\nbut the existence of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), and so on ad\ninfinitum cannot help us explain how anything exists at\nall\u2014where being comes from. Whether or not a regress of grounds\nis vicious, therefore, will depend upon the question for which we are\nseeking an answer.\n\n\nSimilar remarks are made by Graham Priest (2014, 186), who asks us to\nimagine an infinite sequence of objects, \\(a_0\\), \\(a_{-1}\\),\n\\(a_{-2}\\), \u2026 etc. Each of these can be in one of two states:\nactive or passive. For each \\(n \\le 0\\), if \\(a_{n-1}\\) is passive it\ndoes nothing, but if it is active it instantaneously makes \\(a_n\\)\nactive as well; and the only way for \\(a_n\\) to become active is that\n\\(a_{n-1}\\) makes it so. Given this set-up there are only two possible\noptions: each object in the chain is active, or each is passive. But\nboth are logically possible options: the fact that each object is only\nactive if the next object makes it active (and this sequence continues\nwithout end) gives us no reason, says Priest, to reject the\npossibility of them being all active. The active status of each object\nwould be accounted for, by the active status of the previous one.\nFirst we explain the active status of \\(a_0\\): it is explained by the\nactive status of \\(a_{-1}\\). Then we have a completely different thing\nto explain: the active status of \\(a_{-1}\\): it is explained by the\nactive status of \\(a_{-2}\\) \u2026 and so on. All such facts get\nexplained and since, Priest argues, it is a different fact being\naccounted for each time, this regress is not vicious. But echoing\nBliss, Priest admits that something is not explained. He says (ibid.,\n187) \u201c[W]hat an infinite regress will not explain is why the\nwhole regress is as it is \u2026 the state of each \\(a_n\\) is\ndetermined by the state of \\(a_{n-1}\\), but there is nothing in this\nstory to explain why the whole system is in the all active\nstate, as opposed to the all passive state. If there is such\nan explanation, it must come from elsewhere.\u201d\n\nSo if \\(a\\) can only exist if \\(b\\) exists for \\(a\\) to be\nontologically dependent on, and \\(b\\) can only exist if \\(c\\) exists\nfor \\(b\\) to be ontologically dependent on \u2026 and so on ad\ninfinitum, either the whole infinite sequence of things exists,\nor none of them do. And if the whole infinite sequence exists, there\nis no explanation (from within the sequence at least) as to why\nanything exists at all. However, there is an explanation for\neach particular thing as to why it exists: it exists because\nthe next thing in the sequence does. If Bliss and Priest are correct,\nthen whether or not an ontological infinite regress is vicious or\nbenign depends on our explanatory ambitions: are we attempting to\nexplain an (infinite) collection of particular existence facts: that\nthis thing exists, that that thing exists, etc., or\nare we attempting to explain the global fact that things exist.\nExactly the same infinitely regressing ontology can be vicious or\nbenign depending on one\u2019s theoretical lights. Notice the\nsimilarity to the discussion in section 1.3 of Bradley\u2019s and\nMcTaggart\u2019s regresses: once again, whether or not there is\nsomething inherently objectionable to an infinite regress may depend\non our theoretical ambitions. Bliss (2019) argues that Metaphysical\nFoundationalism appears to be motivated by an explanatory demand that\neverything that is apt for explanation be explained in terms of facts\nthat do not require an explanation, but that this explanatory demand\nbegs the question in favor of Foundationalism.\n\nRoss Cameron (2022) argues that when we have an infinite regress of\nontological dependence or grounding, we might as a result of that\nregress lack an explanation of the existence or nature of the entities\non the infinite chain, or of the facts on that chain. However, Cameron\nargues that this is not a reason to deny that such infinite regresses\nare impossible, and instead argues that we must pull apart the notion\nof metaphysical explanation from relations like ontological dependence\nand grounding, which he calls metaphysical determination relations. If\n\\(E_1\\) is ontologically dependent on \\(E_2\\), which is ontologically\ndependent on \\(E_3\\), which is ontologically dependent on \\(E_4\\)\n\u2026 and so on ad infinitum, there might be no\nmetaphysical explanation for certain facts concerning the existence\nand nature of \\(E_1\\), \\(E_2\\), \u2026 etc., but, argues Cameron,\nthis is compatible with each of the facts concerning those things\nbeing adequately grounded in reality, and hence with the reality of\nsuch an infinite sequence. Infinite regresses of metaphysical\ndetermination relations, argues Cameron, might require us to abandon\ncertain explanatory goals, but this does not render them\nimpossible.\n",
