    "main_text": "The Rejection of Special Metaphysics and the Transcendental Dialectic || The Theory of Reason and Transcendental Illusion\n2.1 The Theory of Reason and Transcendental Illusion\n\nThe emphasis on reason in this connection is important, and it links\nup with the project of Kant\u2019s \u201ccritique\u201d of pure\nreason. A major component of this critique involves illuminating the\nbasis in reason for our efforts to draw erroneous metaphysical\nconclusions (to employ concepts \u201ctranscendentally\u201d),\ndespite the fact that such use has already been shown (in the\nTranscendental Analytic) to be illicit. What emerges in the Dialectic\nis a more complex story, one in which Kant seeks to disclose and\ncritique the \u201ctranscendental ground\u201d that leads to the\nmisapplications of thought which characterize specific metaphysical\narguments. In developing the position that our metaphysical\npropensities are grounded in the \u201cvery nature of human\nreason,\u201d Kant (in the Introduction to the Dialectic) relies on a\nconception of reason as a capacity for syllogistic reasoning. This\nlogical function of reason resides in the formal activity of subsuming\npropositions under ever more general principles in order to\nsystematize, unify, and \u201cbring to completion\u201d the\nknowledge given through the real use of the understanding\n(A306/B363-A308/B365). Kant thus characterizes this activity as one\nwhich seeks \u201cconditions\u201d for everything that is\nconditioned. It is therefore central to this Kantian conception of\nreason that it is preoccupied with the \u201cunconditioned which\nwould stop the regress of conditions by providing a condition that is\nnot itself conditioned in its turn.\u201d\n\nThe demand for the unconditioned is essentially a demand for ultimate\nexplanation, and links up with the rational prescription to secure\nsystematic unity and completeness of knowledge. Reason, in short, is\nin the business of ultimately accounting for all things. As Kant\nformulates this interest of reason in the first Critique, it\nis characterized by the logical maxim or precept: \u201cFind for\nthe conditioned knowledge given through the understanding the\nunconditioned whereby its unity is brought to completion\u201d\n(A308/B364). It is central to Kant\u2019s Dialectic that this\nrequirement for systematic unity and completeness of knowledge is\ninherent in the very nature of our reason. Controversially, Kant does\nnot take it that this demand for the unconditioned is something we can\ndismiss, nor does he take the interests we have in metaphysics to be\nmerely products of misguided enthusiasm.\n\nAlthough the demand for the unconditioned is inherent in the very\nnature of our reason, although it is unavoidable and indispensably\nnecessary, Kant nevertheless does not take it to be without problems\nof a unique sort; for the very same demand that guides our rational\nscientific inquiries and defines our (human) reason is also the locus\nof error that needs to be curbed or prevented. In connection with this\nprinciple, then, Kant also identifies reason as the seat of a unique\nkind of error, one that is essentially linked up with metaphysical\npropensities, and one which he refers to as \u201ctranscendental\nillusion [transzendentale Illusion].\u201d Kant identifies\ntranscendental illusion with the propensity to \u201ctake a\nsubjective necessity of a connection of our concepts\u2026for an\nobjective necessity in the determination of things in\nthemselves\u201d (A297/B354). Very generally, Kant\u2019s claim is\nthat it is a peculiar feature of reason that it unavoidably takes its\nown subjective interests and principles to hold\n\u201cobjectively.\u201d And it is this propensity, this\n\u201ctranscendental illusion,\u201d according to Kant, that paves\nthe way for metaphysics. Reason plays this role by generating\nprinciples and interests that incite us to defy the limitations of\nknowledge already detailed in the Transcendental Analytic. The\nIntroduction to the Transcendental Dialectic is therefore interesting\nfor Kant\u2019s presentation of reason as a presumably distinct\ncapacity for cognizing in a way that, as Kant puts it, incites us to\ntear down the boundaries already enforced in the Analytic (cf.\nA296/B352). Kant refers to this capacity of reason as one that leads\nto the specifically transcendent judgments that characterize\nmetaphysics. Thus, the Transcendental Dialectic is said to be\nconcerned \u201cto expose the illusion in transcendent\njudgments\u201d (A297/B354). Indeed, Dialectic is defined as\n\u201cthe logic of illusion [Schein]\u201d (A293/B350).\n\nThe central problem is that the above prescription to seek\nthe unconditioned presents to reason as a metaphysical principle that\ntells us that the unconditioned is already given, and is (as\nit were) \u201cthere\u201d to be found. This problematic principle\nis formulated by Kant as follows: \u201cIf the conditioned is\ngiven, the absolutely unconditioned\u2026 is also given\u201d\n(A308/B366). This \u201csupreme principle of pure reason\u201d\nprovides the background assumption under which the metaphysician\nproceeds. These claims set the agenda for Kant\u2019s project, which\ninvolves showing not simply that the metaphysical arguments are\nfallacious, but also exposing their source in reason\u2019s more\ngeneral illusions.\n\nKant has been traditionally taken to be offering a method of avoiding\nthe insidious \u201ctranscendental illusion\u201d that gives rise to\nmetaphysics. Read in this way, Kant\u2019s Dialectic offers a\ncriticism not only of the specific arguments of metaphysics, but also\nof transcendent, metaphysical (speculative or theoretical)\ninterests and propensities themselves. This certainly accords\nwith much in the Dialectic, and specifically with Kant\u2019s\nwell-known claim that knowledge has to be limited to possible\nexperience. Kant, however, complicates things somewhat by also stating\nrepeatedly that the illusion that grounds metaphysics (roughly, that\nthe unconditioned is already given) is unavoidable. Moreover, Kant\nsometimes suggests that such illusion is somehow necessary for our\nepistemological projects (cf. A645/B673). In this connection, Kant\nargues that the transcendent ideas and principles of reason do have a\npositive role to play in knowledge acquisition, so long as they are\nconstrued \u201cregulatively\u201d and not\n\u201cconstitutively.\u201d He thus suggests that rather than\njettison the ideas of metaphysical objects (something, it seems, he\ndoes not think we are in a position to do), it is best to identify the\nproper use and function of these ideas and principles. This critical\nreinterpretation involves the claim that the ideas and principles of\nreason are to be used \u201cregulatively,\u201d as devices for\nguiding and grounding our empirical investigations and the project of\nknowledge acquisition. What the ideas do not do, according to Kant, is\nprovide the concepts through which we might access objects that could\nbe known through the speculative use of reason.\n\nThe need for this critical reinterpretation stems from the fact that\nreason\u2019s demand for the unconditioned cannot be met or\nsatisfied. The absolutely \u201cunconditioned,\u201d regardless of\nthe fact that it presents to reason as objective, is not an object or\nstate of affairs that could be captured in any possible human\nexperience. In emphasizing this last point, Kant identifies\nmetaphysics with an effort to acquire knowledge of\n\u201cobjects\u201d conceived, but in no wise given (or giveable) to\nus in experience. In its efforts to bring knowledge to completion,\nthat is, reason posits certain ideas, the \u201csoul,\u201d the\n\u201cworld\u201d and \u201cGod.\u201d Each of these ideas\nrepresents reason\u2019s efforts to think the unconditioned in\nrelation to various sets of objects that are experienced by us as\nconditioned.\n\nIt is this general theory of reason, as a capacity to think (by means\nof \u201cideas\u201d) beyond all standards of sense, and as carrying\nwith it a unique and unavoidable demand for the unconditioned, that\nframes the Kantian rejection of metaphysics. At the heart of that\nrejection is the view that although reason is unavoidably motivated to\nseek the unconditioned, its theoretical efforts to achieve it are\ninevitably sterile. The ideas which might secure such unconditioned\nknowledge lack objective reality (refer to no object), and our\nmisguided efforts to acquire ultimate metaphysical knowledge are led\nastray by the illusion which, according to Kant, \u201cunceasingly\nmocks and torments us\u201d (A339/B397).\n\nThe Dialectic is concerned to undermine three distinct branches of\nspecial metaphysics in the philosophical tradition: Rational\nPsychology, Rational Cosmology and Rational Theology. Each of these\ndisciplines seeks to acquire knowledge of a particular metaphysical\n\u201cobject\u201d \u2014 the \u201csoul,\u201d the\n\u201cworld,\u201d and \u201cGod,\u201d respectively. This being\nstated, the Dialectic proceeds systematically to undermine the\narguments specific to each of these disciplines\u2014arguments about,\nfor example, the nature of the soul and the world, and the existence\nof God. Despite the difference in their objects, however, there are a\nnumber of problems shared by all the disciplines of special\nmetaphysics. In its most general terms, the central problem with each\nof these attempts has to do with the fact that the alleged\n\u201cobjects\u201d under consideration are\n\u201ctranscendent.\u201d Although we think the soul, the world, and\nGod (necessarily) as objects, these ideas actually lack\nobjective reality (there is no object corresponding to the ideas that\nis or could be given to us in any intuition). It is thus not uncommon\nto find Kant referring to these alleged metaphysical entities as\n\u201cmere thought entities,\u201d \u201cfictions of the\nbrain,\u201d or \u201cpseudo objects.\u201d Although the Dialectic\ndoes not presume to prove that such objects do not or could not exist,\nKant is committed by the strictures of his own transcendental\nepistemology to the claim that the ideas of reason do not provide us\nwith concepts of \u201cknowable\u201d objects. For this reason\nalone, the efforts of the metaphysicians are presumptuous, and at the\nvery least, an epistemological modesty precludes the knowledge that is\nsought.\n\nFor more on Kant\u2019s theory of illusion, see Allison (2004), Butts\n(1997), Grier (2001, forthcoming), Neiman (1994), Theis (1985), Bird (2006).\nSee also Ameriks (2006), Dyck (2014).\n",
