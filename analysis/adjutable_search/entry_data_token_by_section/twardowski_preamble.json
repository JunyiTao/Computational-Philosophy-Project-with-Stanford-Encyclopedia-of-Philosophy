    "main_text": "\n\nKazimierz Twardowski (1866\u20131938) was an Austrian-born Polish\nphilosopher. He was a student of\n Franz Brentano\n and the founder of the\n Lvov-Warsaw School.\n His main work, On the Content and Object of Presentations\n(1894), established the need for the distinction between the content\nand the object of a presentation within Brentanian theories of the\nintentionality of mental acts. The distinction is a psychological,\nnon-platonistic counterpart of Frege's distinction between sense and\nreference. Other students of Brentano, notably Edmund Husserl and\nAlexius Meinong, integrated the distinction between content and object\nin their works after the appearance of Twardowski's book. Twardowski\nspoke of contradictory objects before Meinong: he was the first\nphilosopher to hold a theory of intentionality, truth, and predication\nin which thinking and speaking about non-existents, including\ncontradictions, involves presenting and naming non-existents,\nincluding contradictory objects. Like Meinong, Twardowski belonged to\na tradition of non-idealistic German-language philosophy that\noriginated with Bernard Bolzano, and that influenced, via G. F. Stout,\nMoore and Russell's transition from idealism to analytic philosophy.\nAfter moving to Lvov (now Lviv) in 1895, Twardowski devoted himself to\nestablishing a tradition of scientific, i.e. rigorous and exact\nphilosophy in Poland inspired by Brentano's views rather than to\npublishing his own ideas. As a result, his published oeuvre,\nwritten in Polish and German, is relatively small. Twardowski's\nunpublished manuscripts, often complete sets of lecture notes,\nconstitute a considerable part of his philosophical corpus. According\nto Roman Ingarden, assessments of Twardowski's achievements and his\nrole in history should be considered incomplete and hypothetical as\nlong as they are based only on his published writings (Ingarden 1948,\n18). Important projects for the edition and dissemination of\nTwardowski's manuscript material have been recently completed or are\ncurrently ongoing in Austria, France, Poland, Italy, and the\n Netherlands.[1]\n\nTwardowski was a sharp thinker and a writer of exemplary clarity. He\nwrote on signs, on meaning and reference, and on indexicality and\ntruth, defending a non-platonistic view of time-independent truth; he\nwrote on the metaphysics of parts and wholes, on ethics, on the\nhistory of philosophy, on the relation between philosophy and\npsychology, and, importantly, on metaphilosophy. In Twardowski's times\npsychology was divided roughly in two camps: \u2018Wundtian\u2019\nexperimental psychology and \u2018Brentanian\u2019 descriptive\npyschology (see the entries on\n Wundt\n and\n Brentano);\n although Twardowski sided mainly with Brentano's way of looking at\npsychology, he lectured on themes from experimental psychology such as\noptical illusion and established the first laboratory of empirical\npsychology in Poland. He developed a judgment-based theory of\nknowledge, and he valued analysis as a fruitful method in philosophy.\nThis notwithstanding, it is a widespread convinction that Twardowski's\nmost tangible success remains his extraordinary work as educator and\ninitiator of philosophical activities in Poland. Indeed, Twardowski\nwas a talented teacher, like Brentano, and he exerted, through his\nteaching, a powerful influence on generations of young Polish\nphilosophers, such as Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz,\nStanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski (who, in turn, taught Alfred Tarski)\nand Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski. This influence regarded first of all\nmatters of method: Twardowski laid emphasis on \u2018small\nphilosophy\u2019, namely on the detailed, systematic analysis of\nspecific problems\u2014including problems from the history of\nphilosophy\u2014characterised by rigor and clarity, rather than on\nthe edification of whole philosophical systems and comprehensive\nworld-views.\n",
