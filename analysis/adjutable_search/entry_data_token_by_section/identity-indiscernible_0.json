    "main_text": "Formulating the Principle\n1. Formulating the Principle\n\n\nThe Identity of Indiscernibles (hereafter called the Principle) is\nusually formulated as follows: if, for every property F,\nobject x has F if and only if object y has\nF, then x is identical to y. Or in the\nnotation of symbolic logic: \n\u2200F(Fx \u2194 Fy) \u2192\nx=y.\n\n\nThis formulation of the Principle is equivalent to the Dissimilarity\nof the Diverse as McTaggart called it, namely: if x and\ny are distinct then there is at least one property that\nx has and y does not, or vice versa.\n\n\nThe converse of the Principle, x=y \u2192\n\u2200F(Fx \u2194 Fy), is called the\nIndiscernibility of Identicals. Sometimes the conjunction of both\nprinciples, rather than the Principle by itself, is known as Leibniz\u2019s\nLaw.\n\n\nThus formulated, the actual truth of the Principle seems unproblematic\nfor medium-sized objects, such as rocks and trees, for they are\ncomplex enough to have distinguishing or individuating features, and\nhence may always be distinguished by some slight physical\ndifference. But fundamental principles are widely held to be\nnon-contingent. We might require, therefore, that the Principle should\nhold even for hypothetical cases of qualitatively identical medium\nsized objects (e.g., clones which, contrary to fact, really are\nmolecule for molecule replicas). In that case, we shall need to\ndistinguish such objects by their spatial relations to other objects\n(e.g., where they are on the surface of the planet). In that case the\nPrinciple is consistent with a universe in which there are three\nqualitatively identical spheres A, B, and C\nwhere B and C are 3 units apart, C\nand A are 4 units apart and A and B are 5\nunits apart. In such a universe, A\u2019s being 5 units from\nB distinguishes it from C, and A\u2019s\nbeing 4 units from C distinguishes it from B. The\nPrinciple often gets called into question, however, when we consider\nqualitatively identical objects in a symmetrical universe. Consider,\nfor instance, a perfectly symmetrical universe consisting solely of\nthree qualitatively identical spheres, A, B\nand C, each of which is the same distance, 2 units, away from\nthe others. In this case there seems to be no property which\ndistinguishes any of the spheres from any of the others. Some would\ndefend the Principle even in this case by claiming that there are\nproperties such as being that very object A. Call such a\nproperty a thisness or haecceity.\n\n\nThe possibility of resorting to thisnesses might make us query whether\nthe usual formulation of the Principle is correct. For as initially\nstated the Principle told us that no two substances exactly resemble\neach other. Yet if A and B otherwise exactly\nresemble each other then, on a common intuition, the fact\nthat A has the property\nbeing identical to A while B has the distinct\nproperty being identical to B cannot result in a respect in\nwhich A and B fail to resemble each other.\n\n\nRather than argue about these intuitions and hence argue as to which\nis the correct formulation of the Principle we may distinguish\ndifferent formulations, and then discuss which, if any, of these are\ncorrect. To that end a distinction is commonly made between\nintrinsic and extrinsic properties. Here it might\ninitially seem that extrinsic properties are those analysed in terms\nof some relation. But this is not correct. For the property being\ncomposed of two concentric spheres is intrinsic. For present\npurposes it suffices to have an intuitive grasp of the\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction. (Or see Weatherson, 2008,\n\u00a72.1.)\n\n\nAnother useful distinction is between the pure and the\nimpure. A property is said to be impure if it is\nanalysed in terms of a relation with some particular substance (e.g.,\nbeing within a light year of the Sun). Otherwise it is\npure (e.g., being within a light year of a star).\nThose two examples are both of extrinsic properties, but some intrinsic\nproperties are impure, (e.g., being composed of the Earth and the\nMoon). According to my definitions all non-relational properties\nare pure.\n\n\nArmed with these distinction we may ask which properties are to be\nconsidered when we formulate the Principle. Of the various\npossibilities two seem to be of greatest interest. The Strong\nversion of the Principle restricts it to pure intrinsic properties, the\nWeak to pure properties. If we allow impure properties the\nPrinciple will be even weaker and, I would say, trivialised. For\ninstance in the three sphere example the impure properties being 2\nunits from B and being 2 units from C are possessed\nby A and only A, yet intuitively they do not prevent\nexact resemblance between A, B and C. (For\na different classification of principles, see Swinburne (1995.))\n\n\nSuppose we take identity to be a relation and analyse thisnesses as\nrelational properties, (So A\u2019s thisness is analysed\nas being identical to A). Then thisnesses will be impure but\nintrinsic. In that case the world consisting of the three\nqualitatively identical spheres 3, 4 and 5 units distance apart\nsatisfies the Weak but not the Strong Principle. And the world with\nthe three spheres each 2 units distance from the others satisfies\nneither version.\n\n\nA further distinction is whether the Principle concerns all items in\nthe ontology or it is restricted to just the category of\nsubstances (ie things which have properties and/or relations\nbut are not themselves properties and/or relations.) It is usually thus\nrestricted although Swinburne (1995) does consider, and defend, its\napplication to such abstract objects as integers, times and places,\nwithout explicitly treating these as substance.\n",
