    "main_text": "Synchronic Norms (I): Requirements of Coherence || Reflection and Other Deference Principles\n3.6 Reflection and Other Deference Principles\n\nWe have just discussed the Principal Principle, which in a sense asks\none to defer to a kind of expert (Gaifman 1986): the chance of an\nevent \\(E\\) can be understood as an expert at predicting whether \\(E\\)\nwill come out true. So, conditional on that expert\u2019s saying so\nand so about \\(E\\), one\u2019s opinion ought to defer to that expert.\nConstrued that way, the Principal Principle is a kind of deference\nprinciple. There can be different deference principles, referring\nto different kinds of experts.\n\nHere is another example of a deference principle, proposed by van\nFraassen (1984):\n\n\n\n\nThe Reflection Principle. One\u2019s credence at\nany time \\(t_1\\) in a proposition \\(A\\), conditional on the\nproposition that one\u2019s future credence at \\(t_2\\) \\((> t_1)\\)\nin \\(A\\) will be equal to \\(x\\), ought to be equal to \\(x\\); or put\nsymbolically: \n\\[\\Cr_{t_1}( A \\mid \\Cr_{t_2}(A) = x )  = x.\\]\n\n\nMore generally, it ought to be that \n\\[\\Cr_{t_1}( A \\mid \\Cr_{t_2}(A) \\in [x, x'] )  \\in  [x, x'].\\]\n \n\n\n\nHere, one\u2019s future self is taken as an expert to which one ought\nto defer. The Reflection Principle admits of a Dutch Book argument\n(van Fraassen 1984). There is another way to defend the Reflection\nPrinciple: this synchronic norm is argued to follow from the\nsynchronic norm that one ought, at any time, to be fully\ncertain that one will follow the diachronic Principle of\nConditionalization (as suggested by Weisberg\u2019s 2007 modification\nof van Fraassen\u2019s 1995 argument).\n\nThe Reflection Principle has invited some putative counterexamples.\nHere is one, adapted from Talbott (1991):\n\n\nExample (Dinner). Today is March 15, 1989.\nSomeone is very confident that she is now having spaghetti for dinner.\nShe is also very confident that, on March 15, 1990 (exactly one year\nfrom today), she will have completely forgotten what she is having for\ndinner now.\n\n\n\nSo, this person\u2019s current assignment of credences\n\\(\\Cr_\\textrm{1989}\\) has the following properties, where \\(A\\) is the\nproposition that she has spaghetti for dinner on March 15, 1989:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    \\Cr_\\textrm{1989} \\big( A \\big) &= \\text{high} \n    \\\\\n    \\Cr_\\textrm{1989} \\Big( \\Cr_\\textrm{1989+1}(A) \\mbox{ is low}  \\Big) &= \\text{high} .\n    \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nBut conditionalization on a proposition with a high credence can only\nslightly change the credence assignment. For such a conditionalization\ninvolves lowering just a small bit of credence down to zero and hence\nit only requires a slight rescaling, by a factor close to 1. So,\nassuming that \\(\\Cr\\) is a probability measure, we have:\n\n\\[\n    \\Cr_\\textrm{1989} \\Big( A \\Bigm\\vert \\Cr_\\textrm{1989+1}(A) \\mbox{ is low}  \\Big) = \\text{still high} ,\n\\]\n\n\nwhich violates the Reflection Principle.\n\nThe Dinner Case serves as a putative counterexample to the Reflection\nPrinciple by allowing one to suspect that one will lose some memories.\nSo it allows one to have a specific kind of epistemic\nself-doubt\u2014to doubt one\u2019s own ability to achieve or\nretain an epistemically favorable state. In fact, some are worried\nthat the Reflection Principle is generally incompatible with epistemic\nself-doubt, which seems rational and permissible. For more on this\nworry, see the entry on\n epistemic self-doubt.\n\n\n",
