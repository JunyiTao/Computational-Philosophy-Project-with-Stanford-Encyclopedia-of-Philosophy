    "main_text": "Original Works\n3. Original Works\n\nApart from translating the works of Averroes, Del Medigo also wrote\noriginal compositions aimed at elucidating Averroes\u2019 doctrines,\nas well as commentaries on works such as the Physics and\nDe substantia orbis. The aim of these works and commentaries\nwas to clarify and elucidate the views of Averroes on various themes,\nand to contextualise these views as widely as possible within the\ncontext of the Averroist corpus. Mirroring a common medieval practice,\nDel Medigo\u2019s originality as philosopher rested not in the\nintroduction of a new metaphysical scheme, i.e., departing from the\nfoundations of Aristotelian physics and metaphysics, but in\ninterpreting and reinterpreting an existing body of works and\ndoctrines. From a methodological perspective, Del Medigo shared with\nhis fellow Paduan Averroists a polemical tendency, arguing that a true\nunderstanding of Averroes\u2019 doctrines required the rejection of\nprevious interpretations. Such false interpretations, in Del\nMedigo\u2019s view, were carried forward either by anti-Averroists\n(most notably Thomas Aquinas) as well as by followers of Averroes,\npast and present, who misunderstood and misconstrued the\nlatter\u2019s doctrines. Among those, Del Medigo\u2019s chief target\nwas the fourteenth century Averroist John of Jandun, whom Del Medigo\nrepeatedly attacks in his works and commentaries. John of Jandun was\none scholar frequently cited in the works of other Paduan Averroists,\nmost often to reject his interpretations (Hasse 2007: 324\u201325;\nMahoney 1997: 140; Engel 2017: 20\u201323). Other scholastic authors\nmentioned by Del Medigo were Albert the Great, Giles of Rome, William\nof Ockham and Walter Burleigh (Montada 2013: 165\u201366, 169). Del\nMedigo\u2019s reference to these authors, as well as his open\ncritique of John of Jandun, portrays him as a prominent Jewish\nrepresentative of the Latin scholastic tradition, and in particular of\nthe Averroist Paduan school of the late fifteenth century (see Zonta\n2006).\n\nThematically, Del Medigo\u2019s Italian works concern Aristotelian\nphysics, metaphysics, and psychology. The works are mutually related,\nas metaphysical discussions rely on physical notions such as matter,\nform, and causality. Thus, for instance, in his physical works, in his\npsychological work the Two Investigations, and in Del\nMedigo\u2019s personal correspondence with Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola, one comes across the denial of the possibility of creation\nex nihilo (Kieszkowski 1964: Licata 2013a: 63; 72; Engel\n2017: 39). Therefore, and despite their diverging thematic\norientation, Del Medigo\u2019s works ought to be perceived as a\ncohesive whole, aimed at clarifying Averroes\u2019 positions in a\nvariety of fields.\n",
