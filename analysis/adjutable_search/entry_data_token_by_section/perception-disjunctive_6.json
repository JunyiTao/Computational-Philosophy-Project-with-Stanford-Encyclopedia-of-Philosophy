    "main_text": "Arguments for Disjunctivism || An Argument for Disjunctivism as the Default View\n3.1 An Argument for Disjunctivism as the Default View\n\n\nWhen J.M. Hinton first introduced discussion of the disjunctive view\nof experience his primary concern was to identify and undermine what\nhe took to be a substantive assumption in much philosophical\ntheorising about perception. His target was the assumption that\nveridical perception and subjectively indistinguishible hallucination\nhave the same intrinsic nature. In particular, his target was the\nassumption that the fact that a hallucination can be subjectively\nindistinguishible from a veridical perception is to be explained by\nthe thesis that these experiences share a common nature that is\nmanifest to one when has the experiences. Hinton does not try to prove\ndirectly that this \u2018common element\u2019 assumption is\nfalse. Instead, he tries to argue that it is unwarranted, and that his\nalternative, disjunctivist approach to perceptual experience should be\nour default view. M.G.F. Martin has also argued that the disjunctive\naccount of experience should be our default view. Martin\u2019s\nargument to this effect is discussed in section 3.3. This section\nfocuses on Hinton\u2019s version of the argument.\n\n\nHinton (1967 and 1973) develops his disjunctivist view by focusing on\nthe kinds of reports we make about an experience we are undergoing\nwhen we are remaining neutral on the question of whether that\nexperience is a veridical perception, an illusion, or a\nhallucination. For example, when making a report about one\u2019s\nexperience in this neutral way one might say \u2018I seem to see\nan F\u2019, which can be true whether or not one is actually\nseeing an F, or one might make a claim about what appears to\none to be the case. Hinton thinks that those who accept the common\nelement assumption will hold that these \u2018Neutral Experience\nReports\u2019 are used to pick out the intrinsic properties of\none\u2019s experience, which are manifest to one simply in virtue of\nhaving the experience, and which the experience could possess whether\nor not one actually perceives anything. Hinton\u2019s alternative\nproposal is that these Neutral Experience Reports are equivalent to\ndisjunctive statements of the form \u2018I see an F, or\nI\u2019m having that illusion\u2019. Hinton labels such disjunctive\nstatements \u2018Perception-Illusion disjunctions\u2019. Hinton\nargues that in order to substantiate their common element assumption,\nhis opponents need to show that our Neutral Experience Reports are not\nequivalent to these Perception-Illusion disjunctions, and he tries to\nargue that this is a challenge that his opponents cannot meet.\n\n\nThe fact that Hinton chooses to focus on the reports we\nmake about our experiences, may be a reflection of the fact that his\nprimary concern is to question an assumption about those properties of\nexperience that we should be in a position to make reports about simply\nin virtue of having the experience. (\u201cYou want a predicate whose\napplicability to what is happening in or to me is made clear to me by\nthe very fact of that thing\u2019s happening\u201d, Hinton 1967,\n224.) We might then understand Hinton as taking his opponent to be\ncommitted to the claims that (a) perceptions and subjectively\nindistinguishible hallucinations have such properties in common, (b) it\nis the fact that perceptions and hallucinations have such properties in\ncommon that explains their being subjectively indistinguishible, and\n(c) these are the properties we are picking out when we make Neutral\nExperience Reports. He may then be seen as trying to undermine the\nassumption that (a) and (b) are correct by throwing into doubt our\nentitlement to (c).\n\n\nFor Hinton, an important feature of his Perception-Illusion\nDisjunctions is that they do not report what is happening to the\nsubject, as distinct from saying, non-committally, that one of a number\nof things is happening. Hinton claims that these disjunctive claims do\nnot give a \u201cdefinite answer\u201d to the question \u2018what\nhappened to the subject?\u2019 or as he sometimes puts it, they do not\ngive the \u201cwhat-it-is of the event\u201d in question. This is why\nHinton thinks that substantiating the relevant common element\nassumption requires showing that our Neutral Experience Reports are not\nequivalent to his disjunctive statements. According to the thought\nexpressed in (c) above, our Neutral Experience Reports are committal in\na way that these disjunctive statements are not. So the idea here seems\nto be that if our Neutral Experience Reports are equivalent to\nHinton\u2019s Perception-Illusion disjunctions, then assumption (c),\nabove, is thereby undermined.\n\n\nOne way of defending a common element view against this line of\nargument might be to defend the claim that one can accept (a) and (b)\nwithout being committed to (c). Alternatively one might object that an\nadequate defence of (a) and (b) need not simply depend on establishing\n(c) (see Snowdon 2008).\n\n\nFurthermore, one might question what Hinton has in mind in his use\nof the term \u2018equivalent\u2019 when he says that his opponent\nneeds to show that our Neutral Experience Reports are not equivalent to\nhis Perception-Illusion disjunctions. For Hinton denies that he is\nsuggesting that his Perception-Illusion disjunctions provide us with a\nconceptual analysis of our Neutral Experience\nReports. Snowdon (2008) suggests that the most obvious reading of\n\u2018equivalent\u2019 in this context is the following:\n\u2018P\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018Q\u2019 if\nand only if it is a priori that necessarily (P if and only\nif Q). Snowdon then poses the following problem for\nHinton\u2019s argument. The fact that a statement is disjunctive does\nnot on its own mean that it cannot be equivalent, in the relevant\nsense, to a non-disjunctive statement, which, as a consequence of\nbeing non-disjunctive, may well count as saying what sort of thing is\nhappening. Snowdon offers a mathematical example in support of this\nclaim. \u2018X wrote down a number which is either 2 or an\nuneven prime number\u2019 is equivalent, in the relevant sense, to\n\u2018X wrote down a prime number\u2019.\n\n\nThe problem this poses for Hinton is that it suggests that he may be\nwrong to assume that his opponent needs to show that our Neutral\nExperience Reports are not equivalent to his Perception-Illusion\ndisjunctions. For even if they were equivalent to the\nPerception-Illusion disjunctions, this might not in itself show that\nsuch reports don\u2019t pick out a common element to perception and\nillusion / hallucination and give a definite answer to the question\n\u2018what is happening?\u2019\n\n\nSnowdon suggests that despite this, what Hinton does achieve, in his\nvarious discussions of these issues, is to put pressure on the\nassumption that there is anything in the use we make of our ordinary\nNeutral Experience Reports that thereby commits us to the common\nelement view\u2014i.e., the view that Hinton is attempting to target.\nSuppose we accept that Hinton does achieve what Snowdon suggests.\nConsistent with this, one might also hold that there is nothing in the\nuse we make of our ordinary Neutral Experience Reports that thereby\ncommits us to a denial of the common element view. One might think that\na denial of the common element view is at least as committal as its\naffirmation, for it involves a substantive metaphysical claim about the\nnature of perceptual experience. So why should we think that the burden\nof proof lies with the common element theorists to establish\ntheir view?\n\n\nAt points it looks as though Hinton thinks that an extra commitment\nincurred by the common element theorist is an epistemic one. For\nexample, Hinton considers the following objection that might be raised\nagainst his disjunctive approach: \u201cIf A-ing [i.e.,\nseeing an O] and B-ing [i.e., having that illusion]\ndid not have a worn-on-the-sleeve property in common, how could you\ntake one for the other?\u201d To which Hinton\u2019s reply is,\n\u201cWhy should it just not seem that they had properties in common?\nSeeing a flash of light and having the illusion seem, but only seem,\nto have in common the property \u2018when x occurs a flash\nof light occurs\u2019\u201d (1967, 225).  The implication here seems\nto be that Hinton is taking his opponent to be making a substantive\nepistemic assumption\u2014that our inability to discern through\nintrospection any differences between a hallucination and a perception\nmust ultimately be explained by our positive ability to discern\nthrough introspection that they are events of the same kind. (For a\ncritique of this assumption, see also Putman 1999).\n",
