Later developments in natural deduction\n\n\nAt the time when Gentzen worked out his system of natural deduction, \nStanislaw Jaskowski was also developing a logical system for \nreasoning with assumptions. Formulas in derivations are arranged in a\nlinear succession, but Jaskowski's paper of 1934 remained fragmentary\nand without substantial results such as a subformula property. The \nlinear variant of natural deduction is followed in many pedagogical \nexpositions of elementary logic (sometimes called \u201cFitch \nsystems\u201d). Gentzen found Jaskowski's work by June 1936, when \nboth were in M\u00fcnster, and considered its linear arrangement of \nformulas an improvement, a \u201cliberation from the straitjacket of\nthe tree form\u201d, into one that reflects \u201cthe linearity of \nthinking\u201d (the former from unpublished notes, the latter from \nGentzen's thesis).\n\n\nThe system of natural deduction lay mostly dormant for some thirty \nyears, until the thesis of Dag Prawitz of 1965, Natural Deduction:\nA Proof-Theoretical Study. The order in which Prawitz presented \nthe normalization theorem was different from the one in Gentzen's \nearly thesis manuscript. Prawitz gave first a normalization theorem \nand subformula property for a system of natural deduction for \nclassical logic. This system contains no disjunction or existence. In\na second stage, he considered intuitionistic natural deduction for \nthe full language of predicate logic and reduced its normalization to\nthe deletion of detour convertibilities as in the fragment of \nclassical logic. When Gentzen's proof of normalization came to light \nin 2005, Prawitz said, in conversation with the present author, that \nit is clear that Gentzen knew the result, because the remarks in the \nprinted thesis are so suggestive.\n\n\nIn the late 1960s, strong normalization became an issue: \nPrawitz, using previous work of William Tait and Jean-Yves Girard, \nproved in 1971 that non-normalities in a derivation can be converted \nin any order, with a terminating normalization process and a unique \nnormal derivation as a result. Gentzen seems not to have noticed the \nlatter, but seems to have thought rather the contrary, by the failure\nof this property for the elimination of cuts in sequent calculus.\n\n\nAt about the same time as strong normalization was studied, the\nCurry-Howard correspondence emerged. Curry had observed in his\nwork on combinatory logic in the late 1950s the analogy between\nimplication elimination in natural deduction and functional\napplication (Curry and Feys 1958). The idea was as old as\nintuitionistic logic: by the \u201cBHK-explanation\u201d of the\nconnectives and quantifiers (for Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov), the\nforms of propositions in intuitionistic logic express prescriptions on\nhow to prove those propositions: a\nconjunction A &\nB is proved by proving A and B\nseparately, a disjunction A \u2228\nB by proving one of A and B, and an\nimplication A \u2283 B by\nshowing how to convert any proof of A into some proof of\nB, and so on. These explanations come very close to the\nintroduction rules of natural deduction, but it remains unknown what\ntheir effect on Gentzen's thought was.\n\n\nThe Curry-Howard correspondence, from a paper by William Howard of \n1969, but published only in 1980, is based on the \n\u201cformulas-as-types\u201d principle, or in another jargon, on \nthe \u201cpropositions-as-sets\u201d principle. A proposition is \nthought of as its set of proofs. Truth of a proposition corresponds \nto the non-emptyness of the set. Proofs of \nA \u2283 B are now functions from (proofs \nof) A to (proofs of) B and \nA \u2283 B itself the set of such \nfunctions. Thus, if f : \nA \u2283 B and \na : A, \nthen functional application gives \nf(a) : B. The reverse, corresponding to the introduction of an \nimplication, is captured by the principle of functional abstraction \nof Alonzo Church's \u03bb-calculus.\n\n\nThe Curry-Howard correspondence has made intuitionistic natural \ndeduction part of the computer science curriculum: it gives a \ncomputational semantics for intuitionistic logic in which \ncomputations, and the executions of programs more generally, are \neffected through normalization. A proof of an implication \nA \u2283 B, say, is a program that \nconverts data of type A into an output of type B. \nThe construction of an object (proof, function, program) f \nof the type \nA \u2283 B ends with an \nabstraction. When an object a of type A is fed into\nf as an argument, the resulting expression is not normal, \nbut has a form that corresponds to an introduction followed by an \nelimination. Normalization now is the same as the execution of the \nprogram f. The use of intuitionistic logic is not tied to \nany intuitionistic philosophy of mathematics, but is just a \nsystematic guarantee for the termination of the execution of computer\nprograms.\n",
