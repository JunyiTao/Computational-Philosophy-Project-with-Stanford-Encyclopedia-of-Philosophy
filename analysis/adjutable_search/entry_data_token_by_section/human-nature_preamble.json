    "main_text": "\n\nTalk of human nature is a common feature of moral and political\ndiscourse among people on the street and among philosophers, political\nscientists and sociologists. This is largely due to the widespread\nassumption that true descriptive or explanatory claims making use of\nthe concept of human nature have, or would have, considerable\nnormative significance. Some think that human nature excludes the\npossibility of certain forms of social organisation\u2014for example,\nthat it excludes any broadly egalitarian society. Others make the\nstronger claim that a true normative ethical theory has to be built on\nprior knowledge of human nature. Still others believe that there are\nspecific moral prohibitions concerning the alteration of, or\ninterference in, the set of properties that make up human nature.\nFinally, there are those who argue that the normative significance\nderives from the fact that merely deploying the concept is typically,\nor even necessarily, pernicious.\n\nAlongside such varying and frequently conflicting normative uses of\nthe expression \u201chuman nature\u201d, there are serious\ndisagreements concerning the concept\u2019s content and explanatory\nsignificance\u2014the starkest being whether the expression\n\u201chuman nature\u201d refers to anything at all. Some reasons\ngiven for saying there is no human nature are anthropological,\ngrounded in views concerning the relationship between natural and\ncultural features of human life. Other reasons given are biological,\nderiving from the character of the human species as, like other\nspecies, an essentially historical product of evolution. Whether these\nreasons justify the claim that there is no human nature depends, at\nleast in part, on what it is exactly that the expression is supposed\nto be picking out. Many contemporary proposals differ significantly in\ntheir answers to this question.\n\nUnderstanding the debates around the philosophical use of the\nexpression \u201chuman nature\u201d requires clarity on the reasons\nboth for (1) adopting specific adequacy conditions for the\nterm\u2019s use and for (2) accepting particular substantial claims\nmade within the framework thus adopted. One obstacle to such clarity\nis historical: we have inherited from the beginnings of Western\nphilosophy, via its Medieval reception, the idea that talk of human\nnature brings into play a number of different, but related claims. One\nsuch set of claims derives from different meanings of the Greek\nequivalents of the term \u201cnature\u201d. This bundle of claims,\nwhich can be labelled the traditional package, is a set of\nadequacy conditions for any substantial claim that uses the\nexpression \u201chuman nature\u201d. The beginnings of Western\nphilosophy have also handed down to us a number of such\nsubstantial claims. Examples are that humans are\n\u201crational animals\u201d or \u201cpolitical animals\u201d. We\ncan call these claims the traditional slogans. The\ntraditional package is a set of specifications of how claims along the\nlines of the traditional slogans are to be understood, i.e., what it\nmeans to claim that it is \u201chuman nature\u201d to be, for\nexample, a rational animal.\n\nVarious developments in Western thought have cast doubt both on the\ncoherence of the traditional package and on the possibility that the\nadequacy conditions for the individual claims can be fulfilled.\nForemost among these developments are the Enlightenment rejection of\nteleological metaphysics, the Historicist emphasis on the significance\nof culture for understanding human action and the Darwinian\nintroduction of history into biological kinds. This entry aims to help\nclarify the adequacy conditions for claims about human nature, the\nsatisfiability of such conditions and the reasons why the truth of\nclaims with the relevant conditions might seem important. It proceeds\nin five steps. Section 1 unpacks the traditional package, paying\nparticular attention to the importance of Aristotelian themes and to\nthe distinction between the scientific and participant perspectives\nfrom which human nature claims can be raised. Section 2 explains why\nevolutionary biology raises serious problems both for the coherence of\nthis package and for the truth of its individual component claims.\nSections 3 and 4 then focus on attempts to secure scientific\nconceptions of human nature in the face of the challenge from\nevolutionary biology. The entry concludes with a discussion of\naccounts of human nature developed from a participant perspective, in\nparticular accounts that, in spite of the evolutionary challenge, are\ntaken to have normative consequences.\n",
