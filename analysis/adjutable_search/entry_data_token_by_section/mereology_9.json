Just as we may want to\nregiment the behavior of P by means of decomposition principles that\ntake us from a whole to its parts, we may look at composition\nprinciples that go in the opposite direction\u2014from the parts to\nthe whole. More generally, we may consider the idea that the domain of\nthe theory ought to be closed under mereological operations of various\nsorts: not only mereological sums, but also products, differences, and\nmore.\n",
