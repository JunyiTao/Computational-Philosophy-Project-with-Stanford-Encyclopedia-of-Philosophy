This is a good framework for\ndiscussing the ontological argument, since on one interpretation, the\nargument rests crucially on cross-world comparisons of greatness and\nthe modal realist can make sense of that kind of talk better than\nviews that reject possible objects. Lewis argues that the principle\n\u201cA being than which nothing greater can be conceived is\npossible\u201d is crucially ambiguous. One kind of reading is that\nthe imagined being\u2019s greatness in its world is greater than the\ngreatness of any other being in that being\u2019s world. That may be\ntrue, but it doesn\u2019t imply that the being actually exists.\nAnother kind of reading focusses on the imagined being\u2019s\ngreatness in this world. It says that there (actually) is a being\nwhose actual greatness is greater than the greatness of any possible\nbeing. That entails the conclusion, but is not plausibly true. The\nbroader conclusion here, that the ontological argument derives its\npersuasive force from an equivocation, is one that has been widely\nadopted since Lewis\u2019s paper.\n\nIn \u201cEvil for Freedom\u2019s Sake\u201d (1993b), Lewis reflects\nat length on the\n free will defence\n to the\n problem of evil.\n Lewis argues that for the defence to work, God must make quite\ndifferent trade-offs between freedom and welfare than we are usually\ndisposed to make, and our understanding of what freedom consists in,\nand what divine foreknowledge consists in, must be different to what\nthey currently are.\n\nIn \u201cDo We Believe in Penal Substitution?\u201d (1997a), Lewis\nnotes that we only sometimes accept that one person can be properly\npunished for another\u2019s misdeeds. He uses this to raise an\ninteresting difficulty for the Christian idea that Christ died for our\nsins, suggesting this may not be a form of penal substitution that is\nnormally acceptable.\n\nIn \u201cDivine Evil\u201d (2007), Lewis suggests that proponents of\nthe problem of evil should not focus on what God fails to prevent, but\non what God does. In orthodox forms of theism, particularly\nChristianity and Islam, God is presented as perpetrating great evil\nagainst sinners of various stripes in the form of extreme punishments\nin the afterlife. Lewis suggests that a God that does would be so evil\nthat we should not only reject Him, but we may regard those who\nendorse the divine punishments as themselves somewhat culpable for\ndivine evil. (The published version of this paper was composed by\nPhillip Kitcher after Lewis\u2019s death from notes Lewis made, and\nconversations Kitcher had with Lewis.)\n",
