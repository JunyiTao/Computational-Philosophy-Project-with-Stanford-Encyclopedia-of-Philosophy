    "main_text": "Payment || Familiar Arguments from Other Contexts\n4.1 Familiar Arguments from Other Contexts\n\nSome of the arguments and issues concerning payment for gametes\nclosely resemble ones arising in other areas such as organ sales, sex\nwork, and commercial surrogacy (see the entries on\n exploitation,\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n feminist perspectives on sex markets,\n parenthood and procreation, and\n the sale of human organs).\n We deal with these briefly here before moving on to consider in\ngreater detail some of the more distinctive issues raised by paying\ngamete providers. The focus here is on gametes for clinical use in\nhuman reproduction, rather than gametes for research purposes,\nalthough many of the same issues also arise in a research setting.\n4.1.1. Harm and/or Risk to Donors\n\nOne of the most obvious issues is harm or risk to the providers\n(Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004).\n\nIn the case of sperm, the physical risks of donating are negligible,\nbut concerns have been raised about psychosocial risks, especially if\none man is permitted to generate numerous offspring. What happens, for\nexample, if a single sperm donor produces hundreds of children and a\nsignificant proportion of those contact him years later? That could\nhave a significant impact on the man\u2019s life (and on the welfare\nof the children, discussed below). One way of containing this risk\nwould be to limit donor offspring numbers; another would be to allow\ndonor anonymity, although that may be objectionable on other grounds\n(see our earlier discussions of donor anonymity and donor offspring\nlimits).\n\nProducing hundreds of children is unlikely to be a problem for egg\ndonors but, unlike sperm donors, these women do face non-negligible\nphysical risks: notably OHSS (Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome).\n\nAs with the organ sale debate, though, it is not clear why the\nexistence of these risks constitutes an objection to payment,\nas opposed to an objection to the whole practice of gamete\ndonation (paid or otherwise) since the risks don\u2019t increase\nas a result of payment (Wilkinson 2013). In response to this, in the\ncase of sperm donation, it could be argued that the scenario where one\nman produces hundreds of children is much more likely to happen if\npayment is allowed, as some men seek to become \u2018professional\nsperm donors\u2019. As has been noted, however, it should be possible\nto neutralise this risk by enforcing donor offspring limits.\n4.1.2. Consent, Exploitation, and Inducements\n\nAnother set of issues is the negative effect that payments, or\npayments above a certain level, are supposed to have on the quality of\nconsent\u2014a concern that is closely linked to worries about\nexploitation. Financial incentives, it is argued, encourage people to\ndo things that they would not otherwise do, encourage them to do\nthings that are harmful, and make their actions, consents, and\ndecisions less likely to be autonomous and voluntary (Resnick 2001;\nSteinbock 2004; Wilkinson 2013). These arguments are more often\ndirected at paid egg donation than paid sperm donation, because the\ndirect physical risks and the sums of money involved for eggs tend to\nbe much greater. Thus, people have been concerned that vulnerable\nyoung egg donors might be lured into the egg market and then exploited\nby clinics, egg banks, or recipients. These concerns structurally\nparallel ones that people often have about commercial surrogacy and\nsex work.\n\nArguments of this kind are dealt with in much more detail in the\nentries on\n Exploitation,\n Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets,\n Parenthood and Procreation,\n Informed Consent, and\n The Sale of Human Organs.\n For the present, we simply note that, while the possibility of\ndefective consent and exploitation must be taken seriously in any\nsystem of paid gamete donation, there seems no reason in principle why\npaying for gametes must be exploitative, nor why it cannot be validly\nconsented to. Provided that the payment-levels are fair, and that the\nprovider\u2019s situation, mental capacities, and access to\ninformation are all sufficiently favourable, it is hard to see\nwhy\u2014in common with other financial transactions\u2014gamete\nprovision can\u2019t be validly consensual and non-exploitative.\n4.1.3. Commercialisation and Selection\n\nFinally, we note here that there is a connection between remuneration\narrangements and selection practices (discussed above). In particular,\none objection to allowing payment\u2014or at least to the unfettered\ncommercialisation of gametes\u2014is that it may encourage a market\nin which particular traits can, for those willing to pay a high price,\nbe aggressively selected for. For example, in the USA, young\nattractive white female egg donors attending \u2018Ivy League\u2019\nuniversities can command a higher fee for their eggs than other\ndonors\u2014and anyone who is willing to pay can have access to those\neggs. So, anyone who regards selection practices like this as\nproblematic may also regard the commercialisation of gametes as\nproblematic inasmuch as it underpins and enables fine-grained\nselection by \u2018gamete consumers\u2019 to take place.\n4.2 Payment and the Welfare of the Child\n\nWe turn now to some of the more \u2018distinctive\u2019 issues\nrelating to paying gamete donors. The first of these is the welfare of\nthe child created. While this issue is \u2018distinctive\u2019\ninasmuch as it applies only in the reproductive sphere (and so not to,\nfor example, organ sale) it does arise in other reproductive areas,\nnotably commercial surrogacy (Harris 2000).\n\nThe main worry here is that when donor-conceived children find out\nthat money is what primarily motivated the donor then, in some cases,\nthis will have adverse psychological effects; in the most extreme case,\nthey may come to feel that they were \u2018bought\u2019 (HFEA 2011).\nWhat follows from this possibility, however, is unclear.\n\nTo start with, there are empirical questions about how many\ndonor-conceived people will feel this way and about how severe their\nnegative feelings (if any) are. Not all donor-conceived people have\nnegative feelings about donor motives and financial reward; some may\nnot care what their donors\u2019 motives were. So, if this concern is\ngoing to ground an ethical argument against paying donors, a solid\nevidence base will be needed to underpin its empirical premises.\n\nSimilarly, there is a set of questions not so much about what donors\u2019\nactual motives are, but about what they write on their\ndonation papers, and about how and when information is conveyed to\ntheir offspring. One view is that, for the sake of the welfare of the\nchild, it would be better for donors to \u2018tell a story\u2019\n(even if not wholly accurate) that donor-conceived children will find\nmore palatable than the bare truth that the donor simply needed money.\nAnother is that if donor-conceived children are communicated with\nappropriately, honestly, and sensitively, and at an early stage then\nany problems associated with donor motives will be minimal (Nuffield\nCouncil on Bioethics 2013).\n\nStill, let\u2019s allow (at least for the sake of argument) that\nthese problems are insurmountable: that\u2014whatever we do\u2014a\nsignificant number of donor-conceived children will be substantially\nharmed by the knowledge that their donors were paid. What follows from\nthis?\n\nFirst, we should note that this area is subject to the implications of\nthe Non-Identity Problem (Parfit 1984). In particular, given that\n(let\u2019s assume) many paid sperm donors would not have donated\nbut for the money, it is plausible to supposed that children who\nsuffer psychological harm when they find out about their donors\nwould not have existed if there hadn\u2019t been payments.\nTherefore, for standard reasons relating to the Non-identity Problem,\nthey may not be harmed by the practice of payment\u2014or at\nleast not in the usual comparative harm-to-interests sense (worse off\nthan they would otherwise have been). (See the entry on the\n non-identity problem.)\n So, while there may still be a child welfare argument against\npayment, it must rely not on harm-avoidance but rather on impersonal\nwelfare considerations.\n\nGiven this, a lot hinges on whether payment is required to ensure an\nadequate supply of donor gametes. If it is not (if, for example, the\nreasons for paying people are quite trivial ones, such as\nadministrative convenience, or even allowing recipients more choice)\nthen the fact that payment will adversely affect the welfare of donor-conceived children does\nlooks like a good (albeit prima facie) reason to prefer\naltruistic donation. Imagine that we have a choice between creating a\npopulation of donor-conceived children using paid donors or a\ndifferent but equally large population using altruistic donors. If (as\nwe\u2019re allowing) the latter will have a higher quality of life\nthen there is a strong \u2018impersonal\u2019 reason, other things\nbeing equal, to prefer the latter: altruistic donation. Things look\nrather different though if the choice is instead between a population\nof donor-conceived children using paid donors or a different and\nsignificantly smaller population, for then it would be necessary\nto \u2018trade off\u2019 a higher average quality of life against\nboth (a) the fact that there are fewer lives overall and (b) any harm\ndone to prospective parents who are denied the opportunity to raise a\ndonor-conceived child. Any such moral calculation will be complex and\nthis goes to show that, in cases where payment is required to secure\nan adequate supply of gametes, this is not obviously wrong (all things\nconsidered) even if there are detrimental effects on donor-conceived\npeople\u2019s quality of life (Wilkinson 2016).\n4.3 Egg Sharing\n\nSome countries (notably the United Kingdom) either prohibit or\nstrictly limit payments to egg donors but allow an exception whereby\n\u2018egg sharers\u2019 (women who are themselves undergoing\ninfertility treatment and wish to donate in return for reduced fees)\ncan receive unlimited benefits-in-kind in the form of cut-price\ninfertility treatment services. The UK, for example, limits payments\nto egg donors to \u00a3750 (approx. US$900) and yet egg sharers can\nhave their own treatment costs reduced by many thousands of pounds\n(HFEA 2017: guidance note 13).\n\nThis raises the question of whether ethically egg sharing is\npreferable to egg selling and, if so, why\u2014along with the closely\nrelated question of whether egg sharing should be treated more\nfavourably in law and professional regulation (Blyth & Golding\n2008).\n\nThe main reason offered in favour of egg sharing is that\n\u2018sharers\u2019 are exposed to less additional harm and/or risk\nthan donors (paid or otherwise), since they are already\nundergoing most of the required interventions as part of ongoing\ntreatment. It is supposed to follow from this that incentivising egg\nsharing (other things being equal) is less morally problematic than\nincentivising egg donation: either because of the putative wrongness\nof encouraging people to take \u2018excessive\u2019 risks, or\nbecause financial incentives may vitiate consent to those risks\n(Wilkinson 2013).\n\nThis does seem like a sound prima facie reason to prefer egg\nsharing although several caveats must be noted. First, some special\ntypes of risk may apply to egg sharers: for example, older women who\ndon\u2019t have many viable eggs left might reduce their chances of\nhaving a child by giving away \u2018surplus\u2019 eggs (Scott,\nWilliams, Ehrich, & Farsides 2012). Second, and similarly,\nconcerns about consent may apply just as forcefully to egg sharers as\nto egg sellers, especially if some of these are\n\u2018desperate\u2019 to have a child and egg sharing is their only\nway of paying for infertility treatment services (Blyth & Golding\n2008). Thirdly, as already mentioned, this argument\u2014if it\nworked\u2014would show egg sharing to be superior not only to paid\ndonation but also to altruistic donation, since the additional risks\nare the same whether paid or not (Wilkinson 2013).\n\nA different kind of reason for treating egg sharing more favourably\nthan egg selling is based on the idea that egg sharers\u2019 motives\nwill typically by morally preferable to those of egg sellers. In\nparticular, it has been claimed that whereas egg sellers are typically\nmotivated by the desire for money, egg sharers act partly out of a\nsense of solidarity with potential recipients\u2014in particular\nbecause both the sharer and the recipient are in similar positions.\nBoth need, or want, infertility treatment services in order to have a\nchild (HFEA 2011; Prainsack & Buyx 2011).\n\nHowever, whether this really justifies the differential treatment of\nbenefits-in-kind (treatment services) and monetary reward is far from\nclear. One reason for doubt is that, as the HFEA notes:\n\n\nWhat is known about donor motivation \u2026 is that it is\nmultifaceted. People make decisions for a range of reasons, and\ncompetent adults are capable of assessing the relative benefits,\nburdens and likely impact of a range of options available to them. An\nincentive to donate does not necessarily mean people will do so purely\nbecause of that incentive. Indeed, the literature suggests that both\ndonors and sharers have mixed motives for donating. (HFEA 2011:\nsection 2, 4.4 [p. 8])\n\n\nThis suggests that, in relation to solidarity, there is no categorical\ndifference between payment and benefits-in-kind. While some egg\nsharers may be motivated mainly by feelings of solidarity, others may\nbe more interested simply in saving money. Conversely, while some paid\ndonors would be \u2018in it just for the money\u2019, others\n(perhaps those whose close friends or relatives have fertility\nproblems, or who have experienced health problems of their own) could\nbe moved to donate because of feelings of solidarity (the fact that\nthey are financially rewarded notwithstanding). As such, it is by no\nmeans obvious that all egg sharers are motivated by feelings of\nsolidarity, or that all paid donors would fail to have this feeling.\nIndeed, it is by no means obvious even that most egg sharers\nare motivated by feelings of solidarity and there is empirical\nevidence suggesting that the number of sharers significantly decreases\nwhen state funded treatment is made widely available (Pennings\n2009).\n\nFinally, and more fundamentally, even if donations motivated\nby altruism or solidarity were morally preferable to more\nself-interested ones (donations motivated purely by the desire for\nmoney, for example) it would not necessarily follow that the latter\nare wrong or should be prohibited. For, it may just be that the former\nare supererogatory: that while paid donation is merely\npermissible, unpaid donation is an act of generosity or solidarity that\ngoes beyond what is morally permitted or required (Wilkinson &\nGarrard 1996).",
