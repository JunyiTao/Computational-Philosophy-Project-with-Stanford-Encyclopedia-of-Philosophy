    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || Time\n5.1 Time\n\nAs noted in\n Section 3.2.2\n above, the treatment of time presents special difficulties in\ncanonical quantum gravity, though they easily generalise to many other\napproaches to quantum gravity. These difficulties are connected with\nthe special role time plays in physics, and in quantum theory in\nparticular. Physical laws are, in general, laws of motion, of change\nfrom one time to another. They represent change in the form of\ndifferential equations for the evolution of, as the case may be,\nclassical or quantum states; the state represents the way the system\nis at some time, and the laws allow one to predict how it\nwill be in the future (or retrodict how it was in the past). It is not\nsurprising, then, that a theory of quantum spacetime would have a\nproblem of time, because there is no classical time against which to\nevolve the \u201cstate\u201d. The problem is not so much that the\nspacetime is dynamical; there is no problem of time in classical\ngeneral relativity (in the sense that a time variable is present).\nRather, the problem is roughly that in quantizing the structure of\nspacetime itself, the notion of a quantum state, representing the\nstructure of spacetime at some instant, and the notion of the\nevolution of the state, do not get any traction, since there\nare no real \u201cinstants\u201d. (In some approaches to canonical\ngravity, one fixes a time before quantizing, and quantizes the\nspatial portions of the metric only. This approach is not without its\nproblems, however; see Isham (1993) for discussion and further\nreferences.)\n\nOne can ask whether the problem of time arising from the canonical\nprogram tells us something deep and important about the nature of\ntime. Julian Barbour (2001a,b), for one, thinks that it tells us that\ntime is illusory (see also Earman, 2002, in this connection). It is\nargued that the fact that quantum states do not evolve under the\nsuper-Hamiltonian means that there is no change. However, it can also\nbe argued (Weinstein, 1999a,b) that the super-Hamiltonian itself\nshould not be expected to generate time-evolution; rather, one or more\n\u201ctrue\u201d Hamiltonians should play this role, though\nuncovering such Hamiltonians is no easy matter. (See Butterfield &\nIsham (1999) and Rovelli (2006) for further discussion.)\n\nBradley Monton (2006) has argued that a specific version of canonical\nquantum gravity \u2013 that with a so-called constant mean\nextrinsic curvature [CMC] (or fixed) foliation \u2013 has the\nnecessary resources to render presentism (the view that all and only\npresently existing things exist) a live possibility (see the section\non Presentism, Eternalism, and The Growing Universe Theory in the\nentry on\n time\n for more on presentism). The reason is that with such a fixed\nfoliation one has at one\u2019s disposal some spacelike hypersurface\nthat contains a set of well-defined events that can be viewed through\nthe lens of presentism, such that this set of events at this\nparticular instant (or \u2018thin-sandwich\u2019) changes over time.\nThough he readily admits that CMC formulations are outmoded in the\ncontemporary theoretical landscape, he nonetheless insists that given\nthe lack of experimental evidence one way or the other, it stands as a\nviable route to quantum gravity, and therefore presentism remains as a\npossible theory of time that is compatible with frontier theoretical\nphysics. Christian W\u00fcthrich (2010) takes Monton to task on a\nvariety of both technical and non-technical grounds. He rightly\nquestions Monton\u2019s claim that the CMC approach really is an\napproach to quantum gravity, in the same sense as string theory\nand loop quantum gravity. It is more of a piece of machinery that is\nused within a pre-existing approach (namely, the canonical\napproach). He also questions Monton\u2019s claim, inasmuch as it does\nconstitute an approach of sorts, that it is viable. Simply not\nbeing ruled out on experimental grounds does not thereby render an\napproach viable. Besides, if anything has the prospect of saving\npresentism, then surely it is Julian Barbour\u2019s position\nmentioned above. This at least has the added benefit of being a\nresearch programme that is being actively pursued.\n\nA common claim that appears in many discussions of the problem of time\n(especially amongst philosophers) is that it is restricted to\ncanonical formulations of general relativity, and has something to do\nwith the Hamiltonian formalism (see Rickles 2008a, pp. 340\u20131 for\nmore details). The confusion lies in the apparently very different\nways that time is treated in general relativity as standardly\nformulated, and as it appears in a canonical, Hamiltonian formulation.\nIn the former there is no preferred temporal frame, whereas the latter\nappears to demand such a frame in order to get off the ground\n(cf. Curiel, 2009, p. 59; Tim Maudlin (2004) tells a broadly similar\nstory).\n\nHowever, this encodes several pieces of misinformation making it hard\nto make sense of the claim that general relativity and canonical\ntheories cannot be \u201creconciled\u201d. The canonical framework\nis simply a tool for constructing theories, and one that makes\nquantization an easier prospect. As a matter of historical fact the\ncanonical formulation of general relativity is a completed project,\nand has been carried out in a variety of ways, using compact spaces\nand non-compact spaces, and with a range of canonical variables. Of\ncourse, general relativity, like Maxwell\u2019s theory of\nelectromagnetism, possesses gauge symmetries, so it is a constrained\ntheory that results, and one must employ the method of constrained\nHamiltonian systems. However, there is no question that general\nrelativity is compatible with the canonical analysis of theories, and\nthe fact that time looks a little strange in this context is simply\nbecause the formalism is attempting to capture the dynamics of general\nrelativity. In any case, the peculiar nature of general relativity and\nquantum gravity, with respect to the treatment of time, resurfaces in\narguably the most covariant of approaches, the Feynman path-integral\napproach. In this case that central task is to compute the amplitude\nfor going from an initial state to a final state (where these states\nwill be given in terms of boundary data on a pair of initial and final\nhypersurfaces). The computation of this propagator proceeds \u00e0\nla sum-over-histories: one counts to the number of possible spacetimes\nthat might interpolate between the initial and final hypersurfaces.\nHowever, one cannot get around the fact that general relativity is a\ntheory with gauge freedom, and so whenever one has diffeomorphic\ninitial and final hypersurfaces, the propagator will be trivial.\n\nA similar confusion can be found in discussions of the related problem\nof defining observables in canonical general relativity. The claim\ngets its traction from the fact that it is very difficult to construct\nobservables in canonical general relativity, while (apparently) it is\nrelatively straightforward in the standard Lagrangian description.\n(See, e.g., Curiel, 2009, pp. 59\u201360, for an explicit statement\nof this claim. Curiel cites a theorem of Torre, 1993, to the effect\nthat there can be no local observables in compact spacetimes, to argue\nthat the canonical formulation is defective somehow.) Again, this\nrests on a misunderstanding over what the canonical formalism is and\nhow it is related to the standard spacetime formulation of general\nrelativity. That there are no local observables is not an artefact of\ncanonical general relativity. The notion that observables have to be\nnon-local (in this case, relational) is a generic feature that results\nprecisely from the full spacetime diffeomorphism invariance of general\nrelativity (and is, in fact, implicit in the theorem of Torre\nmentioned earlier). It receives a particularly transparent description\nin the context of the canonical approach because one can define\nobservables as quantities that commute with all of the constraints.\nThe same condition will hold for the four-dimensional versions, only\nthey will have to be spacetime diffeomorphism invariant in that case.\nThis will still rule out local observables since any quantities\ndefined at points or regions of the spacetime manifold will clearly\nfail to be diffeomorphism invariant. Hence, the problems of\nobservables (and the result that they must be either global or\nrelational in general relativity) is not a special feature of the\ncanonical formulation, but a generic feature of theories possessing\ndiffeomorphism invariance. As Ashtekar and Geroch point out,\n\u201c[s]ince time is essentially a geometrical concept [in general\nrelativity], its definition must be in terms of the metric. But the\nmetric is also the dynamical variable, so the flow of time becomes\nintertwined with the flow of the dynamics of the system\u201d (1974,\np. 1215).\n",
