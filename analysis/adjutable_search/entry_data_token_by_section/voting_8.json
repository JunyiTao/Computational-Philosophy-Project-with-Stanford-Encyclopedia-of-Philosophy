    "main_text": "Moral Obligations Regarding How One Votes || The Epistemic Ethics of Voting\n3.2 The Epistemic Ethics of Voting\n\nConsider the question: What do doctors owe patients, parents owe\nchildren, or jurors owe defendants (or, perhaps, society)? Doctors owe\npatients proper care, and to discharge their duties, they must 1) aim\nto promote their patients\u2019 interests, and 2) reason about how to\ndo so in a sufficiently informed and rational way. Parents similarly\nowe such duties to their children. Jurors similarly owe society at\nlarge, or perhaps more specifically the defendant, duties to 1) try to\ndetermine the truth, and 2) do so in an informed and rational way. The\ndoctors, parents, and jurors are fiduciaries of others. They owe a\nduty of care, and this duty of care brings with it certain\nepistemic responsibilities. \n\nOne might try to argue that voters owe similar duties of care to the\ngoverned. Perhaps voters should vote 1) for what they perceive to be\nthe best outcomes (consistent with strategic voting) and 2) make such\ndecisions in a sufficiently informed and rational way. How voters vote\nhas significant impact on political outcomes, and can help determine\nmatters of peace and war, life and death, prosperity and poverty.\nMajority voters do not just choose for themselves, but for everyone,\nincluding dissenting minorities, children, non-voters, resident\naliens, and people in other countries affected by their decisions. For\nthis reason, voting seems to be a morally charged activity (Christiano\n2006; J. Brennan 2011a; Beerbohm 2012).\n\nThat said, one clear disanalogy between the relationship doctors have\nwith patients and voters have with the governed is that individual\nvoters have only a vanishingly small chance of making a difference.\nThe expected harm of an incompetent individual vote is vanishingly\nsmall, while the expected harm of incompetent individual medical\ndecisions is high. \n\nHowever, perhaps the point holds anyway. Define a \u201ccollectively\nharmful activity\u201d as an activity in which a group is imposing or\nthreatening to impose harm, or unjust risk of harm, upon other\ninnocent people, but the harm will be imposed regardless of whether\nindividual members of that group drop out. It\u2019s plausible that\none might have an obligation to refrain from participating in such\nactivities, i.e., a duty to keep one\u2019s hands clean.\n\nTo illustrate, suppose a 100-member firing squad is about to shoot an\ninnocent child. Each bullet will hit the child at the same time, and\neach shot would, on its own, be sufficient to kill her. You cannot\nstop them, so the child will die regardless of what you do. Now,\nsuppose they offer you the opportunity to join in and shoot the child\nwith them. You can make the 101st shot. Again, the child will die\nregardless of what you do. Is it permissible for you join the firing\nsquad? Most people have a strong intuition that it is wrong to join\nthe squad and shoot the child. One plausible explanation of why it is\nwrong is that there may be a general moral prohibition against\nparticipating in these kinds of activities. In these kinds of cases,\nwe should try to keep our hands clean.\n\nPerhaps this \u201cclean-hands principle\u201d can be generalized to\nexplain why individual acts of ignorant, irrational, or malicious\nvoting are wrong. The firing-squad example is somewhat analogous to\nvoting in an election. Adding or subtracting a shooter to the firing\nsquad makes no difference\u2014the girl will die anyway. Similarly,\nwith elections, individual votes make no difference. In both cases,\nthe outcome is causally overdetermined. Still, the irresponsible voter\nis much like a person who volunteers to shoot in the firing squad. Her\nindividual bad vote is of no consequence\u2014just as an individual\nshot is of no consequence\u2014but she is participating in a\ncollectively harmful activity when she could easily keep her hands\nclean (J. Brennan 2011a, 68\u201394).\n",
