    "main_text": "Religious Epistemology\n3. Religious Epistemology\n\nAccording to the prestigious Cambridge Dictionary of\nPhilosophy, religious epistemology is \u201ca branch of\nphilosophy that investigates the epistemic status of propositional\nattitudes about religious claims\u201d (Audi 2015: 925). Virtually\nall the extant and current methodologies in epistemology have been\nemployed in assessing religious claims. Some of these methods have\nbeen more rationalistic in the sense that they have involved reasoning\nfrom ostensibly self-evident truths (e.g., a principle of sufficient\nreason), while others have been more experiential (e.g., empiricism,\nphenomenology, the stress on passion and subjectivity, the stress on\npractice as found in pragmatism). Also, some have sought to be\nahistorical (not dependent upon historical revelation claims), while\nothers are profoundly historical (e.g., grounded on revelation either\nknown by faith alone or justified evidentially by an appeal to\nmiracles and/or religious experience.\n\nOver the past twenty years, there has been a growing literature on the\nnature of religious faith. Among many philosophers in the analytical\ntradition, faith has often been treated as the propositional attitude\nbelief, e.g., believing that there is or is not a God, and much work\ndevoted to examining when such belief is backed up by evidence and, if\nso, how much and what kinds of evidence. There has been a famous\ndebate over \u201cthe ethics of belief\u201d, determining what kinds\nof belief should not be entertained or countenanced when the evidence\nis deemed insufficient, and when matters of religious faith may be\njustified on pragmatic grounds (e.g., as a wager or venture). Faith\nhas also been philosophically treated as trust, a form of hope, an\nallegiance to an ideal, commitment, and faithful action with or\nwithout belief (for a survey see Abraham & Aquino 2017; for a\nrecent defense of religious faith without belief, see Schellenberg\n2017).\n\nThe following examines first what is known as evidentialism and\nreformed epistemology and then a form of what is called volitional\nepistemology of religion.\n",
