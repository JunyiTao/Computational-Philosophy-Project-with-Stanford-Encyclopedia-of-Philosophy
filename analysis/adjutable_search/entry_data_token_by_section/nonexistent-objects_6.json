Furthermore, they seem to have\nthe logical structure of predications. According to (PP) and (EG), (1)\nimplies\n\n(2)\nThere is something that is identical with the round square.\n\n\nand\n\n(3)\nThere is something that is both round and a square.\n\n\nIf \u201cthere is\u201d means the same as \u201cexist\u201d, these\nare, of course, unacceptable consequences.\n\nThere are two obvious ways out: (i) One could simply reject (1) as\nfalse (or truth-valueless). (ii) One could try to find an adequate\nparaphrase for (1) which accounts for the intuition that (1) is\n\u201cin some sense\u201d true. Such a paraphrase might be\n\n(1\u2032)\nIf there were such a thing as the round square, it would be\nround and a square.\n\n\nBut according to the Meinongian picture, (2) and (3) are acceptable\nconsequences, since they do not entail the existence of\nsomething that is both round and square. Something that is both round\nand square is an impossible object, according to Meinong,\nwhich means that it cannot exist, but this does not entail\nthat there is no such thing. Therefore, the Meinongian can\naccept (1) as true, without resorting to any kind of paraphrase.\n\nWe have seen that there are alternative solutions for every single one\nof the abovementioned problems. But, for all we know, the assertion\nthat there are nonexistent objects is the only way to resolve all\nthese diverse problems in a uniform way.\n",
