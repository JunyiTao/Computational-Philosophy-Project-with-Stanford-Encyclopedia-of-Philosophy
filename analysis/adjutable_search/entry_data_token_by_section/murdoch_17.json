    "main_text": "Murdoch on Attention || Particularity and particularism\n10.2 Particularity and particularism\n\nOne Murdochian strand in care ethics that has been influential outside\nthe care ethics context is particularity\u2014an emphasis on the\nlimits of universal principle and impersonality to capture the\nsubstance of appropriate moral response. This particularity takes two\nforms, or at least two emphases, one on the particularity of\nsituations\u2014the (alleged) impossibility of coming up with a set\nof general moral principles or a moral code that will always prescribe\nthe right action (McDowell\u2019s emphasis, and the focus of what is\ncalled \u201cparticularism\u201d [Hooker & Little 2000]). The\nother is on the particularity of persons as objects of moral attention\nand concern. (There are other typologies of particularism. See Driver\n2012.) Both dimensions are present in Murdoch\u2019s thought and in\ncare ethics, and the person-focus is more central to both Murdoch and\ncare ethics. Millgram finds a resource for particularism in\nMurdoch\u2019s emphasis on finding the best description of a\nsituation (Millgram 2002), but situation-particularity remains within\nthe \u201caction/reasons for action\u201d framework that Murdoch\ndefinitively transcends, and person-particularity is crucial for her\ndoing so.\n",
