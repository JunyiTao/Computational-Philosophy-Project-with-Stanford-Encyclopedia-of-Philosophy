    "main_text": "Zen\u2019s Methods: K\u014dan Practice and Just Sitting\n2. Zen\u2019s Methods: K\u014dan Practice and Just Sitting\n\nThere are basically two methods utilized in meditation practice in Zen\nBuddhism to assist the practitioner to reach the above-mentioned\ngoals, together with a simple breathing exercise known as\n\u201cobservation of breath count\u201d (s\u016bsokukan);\none is the k\u014dan method and the other is called\n\u201cjust sitting\u201d (shikan taza), a form of\n\u201csingle act sam\u0101dhi.\u201d For example, the\nformer is employed mainly by the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism, while\nthe latter by the S\u014dt\u014d school; they are the two main schools\nof this form of the Buddha-Way still flourishing today in Japan. In\nthe Rinzai school, the k\u014dan method is devised to assist\nthe practitioner to become a \u201cZen person\u201d (Kasulis, 1981)\nwho fully embodies both wisdom and compassion. A k\u014dan is\nformulated like a riddle or puzzle and is designed in such a way that\nintellectual reasoning alone cannot solve it without breaking through\nthe barrier of ego-consciousness by driving it to its limit. This is,\nZen believes, because ego-consciousness is fortified by the shield of\na dualistic conceptual paradigm with all its attendant presuppositions\nand conditions. The ego-consciousness of a given cultural and\nhistorical milieu accepts that paradigm to be true in order to live a\nlife anchored in the everyday standpoint. \n\nAccording to Hakuin (1685\u20131768), who systematized\nk\u014dans, there are formally seventeen hundred cases of\nk\u014dans, and if sub-questions are added to them, a total\nnumber of cases comprising the system would be roughly three thousand.\nThe Zen practitioner of the Rinzai school is required to pass them all\nin a private consultation with a Zen master who checks the\npractitioner\u2019s state of mind before he or she is granted a seal\nof transmission. This transmission is said to occur \u201conly from a\nBuddha to a[nother] Buddha\u201d (yuibutsu yobutsu).\n\nK\u014dans are accordingly grouped into five categories in a\nmost fully developed system: the first group is designed for reaching\nli (suchness) (richi) or the body of truth\n(hosshin), i.e., an enlightenment experience; the second\ngroup for a linguistic articulation (gensen) of meditational\nexperiences in order to master the skillful use of language; the third\ngroup for those k\u014dans truly difficult to pass\n(nant\u014d); the fourth group for the practitioner to make\nan insight of k\u014dan experiences pertinent to daily life\n(kikan) in order to embody a middle-way in which the\npractitioner won\u2019t be steeped either in the state of meditation or the\nactivity of daily life; and the fifth group for going beyond the state\nof buddhahood by erasing all traces of enlightenment in order to\nachieve a traceless enlightenment (k\u014dj\u014d).\n\n\nThe Rinzai school summarizes this process of self-cultivation in four\nmottoes: \u201cbeing a special transmission outside of the\nscriptures,\u201d \u201chaving no dependence on words and letters,\u201d\n\u201cpointing directly into [one\u2019s] human mind,\u201d and\n\u201cseeing into [one\u2019s] nature to become a buddha.\u201d (See,\nfor examples, The Gateless Gate and The Blue Cliff\nRecord.) While the first two phrases point to the fact of\ndiscovering an extra-linguistic reality that naturally opens up in\nmeditational experience and of articulating it linguistically in the\n\u201cbest\u201d way according to the capacity of an individual\npractitioner, the last two phrases indicate a concretization of the\noriginal or inherent enlightenment (hongaku) in the Zen practitioner,\nwhere the original enlightenment means that human beings are innately\nendowed with a possibility of becoming a Buddha.\n\nOn the other hand, the S\u014dt\u014d school, of which D\u014dgen\n(1200\u201354) is the founder, does not rely on an elaborate\nk\u014dan system to learn to become a Zen person, but instead\nfollows a method called \u201cjust sitting\u201d (shikan\ntaza). It refers to a single-minded, diligent practice where the\nqualifying term \u201cjust\u201d means the practice of meditation\nwithout any intervention of ego-logical interest, concern, or desire,\nso that the practice remains undefiled. This is a method of meditation\npredicated on the belief that the Zen practitioner engages in the\npractice in the midst of the original enlightenment. Or to\ncharacterize it by using D\u014dgen\u2019s phrase, it is a method of\n\u201cpractice-realization.\u201d By hyphenating practice and\nrealization, the following implications are suggested: meditation is\nnot a means to an end, i.e., a means to realization, and thereby\nD\u014dgen closes a dualistic gap, for example, between potentiality\nand actuality, between before and after. Accordingly, he collapses the\ndistinction between \u201cacquired enlightenment\u201d\n(shikaku) and \u201coriginal enlightenment,\u201d\n(hongaku) where the \u201cacquired\u201d enlightenment\nmeans an enlightenment that is realized through the practice of\nmeditation as a means. With this collapsing, the S\u014dt\u014d School\nholds that practice and realization are non-dual in relation to each\nother; they are \u201cnot two.\u201d\n\nAccording to the S\u014dt\u014d school, the meditational practice,\nwhen it is seen as a process of discovery, is a deepening process of\nbecoming aware of the original enlightenment with an expansion of its\ncorresponding experiential correlates and horizons, and it is for this\nreason called the school of \u201cgradual enlightenment\u201d or\n\u201csilent illumination.\u201d On the other hand, the Rinzai\nschool is called the school of \u201csudden enlightenment,\u201d\nbecause it does not recognize a process leading to enlightenment\n(satori) as something worthy of a special attention; what\ncounts is an experience of satori only. Even though there is\nthe above difference in approach between Rinzai and S\u014dt\u014d\nschools, the outcome is the same for both insofar as the embodiment of\nwisdom and compassion is concerned. This is because they both follow\nthe same practice of sitting meditation. Whatever differences there\nare between the practitioners of the two schools in regard to the\nlinguistic articulation of their meditational experience, they arise\nfrom individual practitioners\u2019 personalities, dispositions,\nintellectual capacities, and/or linguistic abilities.\n",
