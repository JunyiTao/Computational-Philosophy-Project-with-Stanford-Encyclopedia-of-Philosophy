There has also been\nincreasing philosophical writing on disability, particularly in\nrelation to justice and equality. Until recently, however, there has\nbeen little philosophical discussion of disability's relevance to well-being,\nhealth, or personal relationships\u2014in contrast to the growing\nscholarship on these topics in the social sciences. Until the past\ndecade, most philosophical discussions of well-being simply treated\ndisabilities as conditions that reduced it. Philosophical\naccounts of health and disease have mentioned disability, but mainly\nto treat it as a form of disease or ill-health; they have had little\nto say about the complex, contested relationship between disease and\ndisability. And with the notable exception of parental attitudes\ntoward one\u2019s actual or possible disabled children, the role of\ndisability in personal relationships has provoked scant philosophical\ninterest.\n\nThis Entry will proceed as follows. Part 1 will discuss disability and\nwell-being. It will begin by reviewing debates on the application of\nthree standard accounts of well-being to disability. It will note the\ndivergence between first- and third-person assessments of the impact\nof disability on well-being under all these accounts and suggest\nsome reasons for this divergence. We will then examine what we regard\nas the most difficult challenge to the claim that many or most\ndisabilities do not necessarily reduce well-being: the widely-held\nview that it is desirable to prevent, correct, or mitigate\ndisabilities, and generally undesirable to acquire one. The concluding\nsection of Part 1 will examine how assumptions about disability and\nwell-being inform a number of contemporary debates in medicine and\nhealth care.\n\nPart 2 will examine philosophical writing on health and disease. It\nwill review different definitions of health and their implications for\nthe question of whether it is necessarily unhealthy to be disabled. It\nwill consider the few attempts that have been made to distinguish\ndisability from disease. It will also note a tension for disability\nscholars in making the distinction between disease and disability:\nalthough that distinction provides a basis for separating the medical\nfrom the socially constructed aspects of disability, it can also\noversimplify the experience of people with disabilities.\n\nPart 3 will discuss disability and personal relationships. It will\nexamine widely shared assumptions concerning the impact of\ndisabilities on a variety of relationships, in particular the doubts\nexpressed by many laypeople about the capacity of adults with\ndisabilities to become friends, lovers, and parents. This Part will\nalso consider how historical and contemporary accounts of friendship\nand love apply to persons with disabilities.\n\nAfter exploring the relevance of disability to well-being, health, and\npersonal relationships, this Entry will conclude by examining common\nfeatures of the philosophical treatment of disability in the three\ndomains. Philosophical scrutiny is particularly needed in these areas,\nbecause of the strength and persistence of popular assumptions about\nthe adverse impact of disability on all three.\n\nThe impact that disability has on each domain is largely a function of\nthe view or model of disability one accepts. Disability scholars and\nphilosophers of disability now refer to two models of disability, the\nmedical and the social (see\n SEP entry on disability: definitions, models, experience).\n For present purposes, we understand the social model of disability as\nholding that the physical and social environment are the primary\nsource of the limitations and disadvantages faced by people with\nalmost all impairments. This model has obvious relevance for the\naccounts of well-being, health, and personal relationships we will\nexamine. It suggests that if people with disabilities appear to be\nunhappy, unhealthy, or socially isolated, it is primarily due to\ncontingent features of their physical and social environments, not to\nany intrinsic features of their impaired functions. In some cases,\nthis recognition will require a reassessment of their present\nwell-being, health, or social relationships. In other cases, it will\nnot challenge that assessment, but will alter the prescription for\nimproving their well-being, health, or relationships, or the\nexpectation of success in doing so.\n", "toc": [{"#DisWelBei": "1.

Disability and Well-Being\n\nThe relationship between disability and well-being is important both\ntheoretically and practically. How philosophers, social scientists,\npolicy makers, and lay people understand that relationship matters for\nthe theories of welfare and flourishing we construct, the judgments\nabout our lives we make on a regular basis, and the social and health\npolicies we adopt.\n\nAssumptions about well-being, tacit as well as explicit, pervade our\nthinking about disability. Decisions about abortion after a\n\u201cpositive\u201d prenatal test result are often based on the\nparents\u2019 judgment about the child\u2019s expected quality of\nlife. Decisions about life-sustaining treatment for severely disabled\ninfants and critically ill adults are often made on the same basis,\nalthough what counts now as an acceptable quality of life may differ\nfrom what is considered acceptable when contemplating the futures of\nfetuses and newborns. Judgments of well-being also figure in\nallocation decisions, where scarce resources may be diverted away from\npersons who, because of certain disabilities, are deemed to have poor\nprospects for an acceptable quality of life, and toward persons with\n\u201cbetter\u201d prospects. The examples could be multiplied, and\nthey are not confined to health-related matters.\n\nDisability is often initially encountered as an atypical mental or\nphysical condition whose impact on well-being is mediated by the\nphysical and social environments. For example, an individual is\ndeciding whether to undertake expensive and risky surgery to restore\nfunctioning lost in an accident; a couple is deciding whether to\ncontinue a pregnancy with a fetus diagnosed with a genetically-based\nhealth condition; a legislature is deciding how much money to allocate\nto competing injury-prevention programs. All these decision makers\nfirst confront disability as a biological phenomenon\u2014a sudden or\ngradual loss of functioning; a genetic condition with various health\neffects; a range of vehicular, recreational, household, and workplace\ninjuries. Their concern is with the effect of disability, encountered\nthis way, on lives they care about or are charged with protecting:\ntheir own, their future children\u2019s, or their\nconstituents\u2019.\n\nAs these examples suggest, the fact that\ndisability-related disadvantages often reflect contingent features of the\nsocial environment may have different relevance for different decisions\nand decision makers. Parents deliberating about whether to have a\nchild with a severe disability may need to treat as\n\u201cgiven\u201d the adverse effects on well-being of social stigma\nor inadequate educational resources. It is far less clear that\nlegislators would be justified in treating as \u201cgiven\u201d the\nreduction in well-being associated with these social conditions, given\nthat they are in a position to modify those conditions, by, for\nexample, prioritizing funding for inclusive education.\n1.1 Disability and Subjective Theories of Well-Being\n\nWe begin by examining the impact that disabilities have, or are\nexpected to have, on various accounts of well-being. Philosophical\ndiscussions of what makes life go well generally recognize three\ndistinct types of accounts. T.M. Scanlon distinguishes \n\n\n\u201cexperiential theories\u2026which hold that the quality of a\nlife for the person who lives it is determined completely\nby\u2026its experiential quality;\u201d \n\n\u201cdesire theories\u2026which hold that the quality of a\nperson\u2019s life is a matter of the extent to which that\nperson\u2019s desires are satisfied;\u201d \n\n\nand \n\n\n\u201csubstantive-good theories\u2026which hold that there are\nstandards for assessing the quality of a life that are not entirely\ndependent on the desires of the person whose life it is\u201d.\n(Scanlon 1998:\n 109ff)[1]\n\n\n\nThe first two accounts are \u201csubjective\u201d, in that they\ndefine well-being as relative to the individual\u2019s mental states,\nwhereas the last theory is \u201cobjective\u201d, assuming a\nsubstantive view about what makes a life go well that is independent\nof the individual\u2019s mental states (see\n SEP entry on well-being).\n\nThese rival accounts of well-being clearly have different implications\nfor the bearing of disability on individual well-being. If, as hedonic\nexperiential theories hold, well-being is a matter of having positive\nexperiences, whether disability reduces well-being depends on whether\nand to what extent it reduces the number or intensity of positive\nexperiences enjoyed by persons with disabilities. On these theories,\nthe self-reports of persons with disabilities carry considerable\nweight in assessments of well-being, at least if we accept the\nassumption that people are in a better position, epistemically, to\nassess the quality of their own experiences than other people\u2019s.\nIndeed, most research on the well-being of people with disabilities\nrelies on self-reports, and those reports do not confirm the grim\nviews of third parties. Most people with disabilities report a quality\nof life similar to people without disabilities (Saigal et al. 1996;\nAlbrecht and Devlieger 1999; Gill 2000; Goering 2008).\n\nFor similar reasons, self-reports ought to carry considerable\nevidentiary weight on desire-based accounts of well-being\u2014though\nperhaps not as much weight as on the experiential view, if we have\nless first-person authority with respect to what our desires and their\nfulfillment than t we do with respect to our experiences. Self-reports\nhave the most limited and contingent relevance on objective accounts,\nsince individuals will not always be in the best position to know how\nwell they are doing in various physical, social, and professional\ndomains.\n\nSome philosophers regard the implication that persons with\ndisabilities can achieve levels of well-being equal to those of their\nable-bodied counterparts as a reductio of subjective accounts\n(see Sen 1980; Crocker 1995). And some disability scholars have been\ndrawn to subjective metrics on the basis of their considered judgment\nthat persons with disabilities can achieve levels of well-being that\nare at least comparable to those of their able-bodied counterparts.\nDespite this, subjective accounts may offer only thin practical\nsupport for the claim that disabled people are not handicapped in the\npursuit of happiness. Many nondisabled philosophers and laypeople are\ninclined to doubt the reliability of disabled persons\u2019\nself-reports to the effect that they are doing well. Some suspect that\nthese ratings are deliberately overstated to take account of their\nexpected discounting by nondisabled people. Others regard them less as\nself-reports than as directives against pity or sympathy. \n\nEven when self-reports are accepted as sincere, the interpretation of\nself-reported well-being is disputed (Menzel et al. 2002; McClimans et\nal. 2013; Barnes 2009b). Some psychologists and philosophers see those\nreports as distorted by adaptation or response-shift; by habituation\nto aversive experiences or a shift to more modest objectives or\ncomparison classes (Menzel et al. 2002; Murray 1996; McClimans, et\nal. 2013). Indeed, the phenomenon of adaptation highlights some of the\ndifferences among rival accounts of well-being.  Adaptation refers to\na group of processes, though which newly disabled people change their\nhabits, activities, and goals to accommodate their disabilities. Among\nthose processes are developing new skills, changing comparison classes\nand goals, and habituating to pleasant or unpleasant experiences\n(Menzel et al. 2002). Although the first of these processes\u2014the\nacquisition of new skills\u2014might reflect a change in objective\nwell-being, the latter two would not (unless feelings of satisfaction\nand pleasure are included on the \u201cobjective\u201d list). But\nhabituating to unpleasant experiences might improve well-being under a\nhedonic account by making the individual feel less pain or more\npleasure. Similarly, insofar as changing one\u2019s goals involves\nchanging one\u2019s desires, and insofar as one\u2019s new\ndesire-set is more satisfiable than one\u2019s old desire set, the\nsecond process of adaptation would also yield an improvement in\nwell-being on the desire-satisfaction view. By contrast, on an\nobjective account of well-being, mere habituation and goal-downsizing\nhabituation would not necessarily improve well-being.\n1.2 Disabilities and Objective Lists\n\nDerek Parfit has coined the term \u201cobjective list theories\u201d\nto refer to accounts that assess well-being in terms of a set of goods\nand activities that are objectively good for people (Parfit 1984:\n493ff). Some of the more contentious questions about the relationship\nbetween disability and individual well-being concern what objective\ngoods are indispensable for a good life and at what level of\ngenerality they should be described. Although \u201cobjective list\ntheories\u201d may suggest a simple checklist, they are better seen\nas recognizing (i) that there is an irreducible plurality in the goods\nof life and (ii) that their contribution to well-being cannot be\nexpressed in terms of a common metric, like utility. Both (i) and (ii)\ndistinguish objective list theories as a special case of objective or\nsubstantive-good theories of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, an\ninfluential objective list theorist, includes the following among her\nvaluable capabilities and functionings: health, nourishment, shelter,\nsex, mobility; the ability to use one\u2019s senses and to imagine,\nthink, and reason; family and other relationships, attachments and\nlove; living a life one has thought about and in some way chosen;\nlaughter, play, and living in contact with the natural world (Nussbaum\n1998: 135\u2013156). It is difficult to see what unifies all these\ndifferent categories, but item by item there would probably be\nwidespread agreement on their value and importance for individual\nwell-being. \n\nGiven that several of the items on Nussbaum\u2019s \u201998 list\ncannot be enjoyed by many people with disabilities, it follows that if\nhigh levels of well-being cannot be attained by someone who cannot\nenjoy all of the items on the list, then high levels of well-being are\nnot attainable by many people with disabilities. If that implication\nis false, then the list must be changed. For example, even if it is\nnecessary to include substantive goods or normative ideals in an\naccount of individual well-being, it is not clear that all of\nthe categories in Nussbaum\u2019s list, for example, are\nnecessary for high levels of well-being. As Jerome Segal\n(1998) points out, most of us would agree that a life can go very well\nwithout one or more of the capabilities Nussbaum regards as essential.\nIndeed, the most successful of lives of people lacking a single\ncapability may go as well as the most successful lives of people with\na standard complement of sensory and motor functions. Although a life\ncould hardly go well without at least some of these capacities, we\nhave no clear basis for establishing a minimum set.\n\nIn understanding how disability may be compatible with high levels of\nwell-being, understood in objective terms, it is helpful to\ndistinguish intrinsic from instrumental value. An activity may\nvaluable for itself, e.g., seeing as a rich sensory experience; or\ninstrumentally, for what it achieves or contributes to, e.g., seeing\nas a means of finding an object. As intuitive as the distinction\nseems, it is difficult to make clearly. First, there is deep\ndisagreement about what is of ultimate value. Second, it is possible\nto parse many activities and conditions indefinitely into\ninstrumentally valuable means and intrinsically valuable ends, e.g.,\nmaking money or friends can be seen as an end in itself, or as a means\nto obtaining comfort and security (see\n SEP entry on intrinsic vs. extrinsic value).\n\nThe social model of disability encourages us to recognize that many of\nthe activities precluded by certain disabilities can be seen\ninstrumentally, as means to valuable ends\u2014ends that can be\nachieved by other means that are not precluded by those disabilities.\nAs Asch contends (2003),\n\n\nThose who maintain that disability forecloses opportunity, and that\nany foreclosed opportunity diminishes life, focus too narrowly on the\nactivity and do not see it as a means to an end, e.g., \u2026\nwalking instead of mobilizing or exploring; talking instead of\ncommunicating.\n\n\nAs Asch suggests, much of what we value in seeing, talking, and\nwalking is instrumental. We value them as ways of achieving\ncommunication with other people, reading, and moving from place to\nplace, are themselves be bearers of intrinsic value. (Of course, we\nalso recognize that these activities have instrumental value as well,\ne.g., for finding social partners and business opportunities). None of\nthese valuable activities, however, is precluded by deafness,\nblindness, or paraplegia. Each can be achieved in alternative ways, by\nsigning, reading braille, or operating a wheelchair. If these\nconsiderations are on the right track, they show that the instrumental\nvalue of species-typical functioning is exaggerated, because its ends\ncan frequently be achieved in multiple ways, many of which are\navailable to people with fewer, impaired, or atypical functions.\n\nDisability scholars do not deny that typical sensory and motor\nfunctions can have great intrinsic as well as instrumental value, but\nthey argue that their intrinsic value is often understood too\nnarrowly. If, for example, we see the intrinsic value in sight not\nspecifically in visual experience, but in sensory and aesthetic\nexperience, then that value is not precluded by blindness.\n\nIt may be true that someone who cannot see or hear lacks experiences\nof great intrinsic value that are available to someone who can see or\nhear. However, the broad characterization favored by disability\nscholars seems most appropriate for assessing the role of intrinsic\nvalue in how well our lives go. For example, one obvious source of\nintrinsic value for standard sensory functions and activities is\naesthetic\u2014the beauty, richness, and complexity of the\nexperiences they enable. But we do not regard color-blindness,\ntone-deafness, or impairments of smell or taste as inimical to\nwell-being, although they preclude vast ranges of rich aesthetic\nexperience. There is no reason to doubt that someone who has never\nhad, or has long lost, those sensory functions (as opposed, say, to an\nvisual artist or food critic who relies on them for her vocation) can\nlead a life as rich and rewarding aesthetically as someone who has\nthose functions, despite lacking admittedly valuable experiences. This\nsuggests that we cannot infer from the fact that there is great value\nin a function that those who lack it have lives that go significantly\nless well. It is only plausible to claim that a good life needs to\ncontain certain kinds of valuable experiences and activities if those\nkinds of experience and activity are characterized very broadly. We\nwill have more to say about this below, in reviewing the debate over\nwhether disabilities can be seen as \u201cneutral\u201d\ncharacteristics.\n\nFinally, even granting the significance of objective goods for\nwell-being, it is not only their possession that makes a life go well.\nAlso relevant is how a life seems to the person living it, and this\nreintroduces subjective elements. Common sense supports the view that\nindividual well-being must have a subjective as well as an objective\naspect; \u201ctwo strands\u201d, as Jonathan Glover puts it (Glover\n2006: Chapter 3). Roughly speaking, well-being consists partly in\nhaving certain substantive goods and partly in being happy with (or\nbeing content with, or enjoying, or taking pleasure in) one\u2019s\nlife. But these strands may not be readily separable: the positive\nvaluation of objective goods may be necessary for the possession of\nthose goods to count towards well-being, or for their absence to count\nagainst it. Moreover, any plausible objective list must include\nenjoyment or pleasure, either as a free-standing good or as an aspect\nof valued states, activities or relationships.\n1.3 Cognitive Disability and Well-Being\n\nThe differences among standard accounts of well-being are particularly\nsignificant in thinking about the well-being of people with severe\ncognitive impairments. We believe that a separate discussion of this\ntopic is warranted, but not because cognitive impairments are in a\nclass by themselves. As we have noted, there are great differences\namong all types of impairments. Cognitive impairments, however, have\nuntil recently received relatively little attention in philosophy, and\nwe give them special emphasis as a corrective.\n\nSubjective accounts of well-being, hedonic and simple-desire accounts,\nappear easier to apply to people with such impairments, for two\nreasons. First, joy, pain, satisfaction, and frustration are more\nreadily conveyed and assessed than the more complex mental states that\ninformed-desire and objective list theories take into account. Second,\npeople with cognitive impairments appear less capable of enjoying or\nattaining some items on standard objective lists: not merely various\nforms of achievement, but also a variety of social relationships and\naesthetic experiences. More broadly, persons with cognitive\nimpairments may be unable to form and pursue a conception of the good\nlife. The conviction that persons with severe cognitive impairments\ncan and often do enjoy relatively high levels of well-being thus seems\nto favor a more subjective account of well-being than that adopted for\neveryone else.\n\nEven Martha Nussbaum (2006), a strong proponent of an objective\naccount of well-being and of the capabilities of people with\ndisabilities, fears that the premium her capabilities account places\non choice may be excessive in assessing the well-being of people with\nthe most severe cognitive disabilities, who lack the capacity to make\nmeaningful choices in some or many domains. She favors a greater\nemphasis on functionings than capabilities for people with cognitive\ndisabilities: on what they actually do or experience than on their\ncapacity to choose among experiences, activities, and life plans. This\nsuggests a way to modify her account so that more people with such\ndisabilities reach a threshold of well-being. But it adopts different\nstandards for people with severe cognitive disabilities as compared to\nother people, and raises the question of where and how to draw the\nline between those to whom each standard applies.\n\nSome disability scholars may worry that the use of a double-standard\nis fraught with elitism and condescension. But it has a stubborn\nappeal, insofar as objective accounts seem too demanding when applied\nto cognitively disabled people. Jeff McMahan concedes that it seems\n\u201cdeeply and perniciously inegalitarian\u201d to place people\nwith severe congential cognitive impairments in a separate comparison\nclass from cognitively normal people for purposes of assessing their\nwell-being (2001: 160).\nBut he argues that it is even less plausible and attractive to view\nsuch individuals as suffering grave misfortune, however well they do\nwith their limited potential.\n\nOf course, it could simply be the case that all else equal, people\nwith severe cognitive disabilities do have lower levels of well-being\nthan people without these disabilities. But all else need not be\nequal: it may be that many people with cognitive disabilities can\nachieve levels of well-being as high as others if they receive certain\nforms of support. For example, recognizing that cognitively disabled\npersons may require assistance if they are to develop and carry out\nconceptions of the good life, Nussbaum (2006, 2009) and Francis (2009)\nhave proposed structured ways of assisting them to do so. Nussbaum\nsuggests that people with even severe cognitive disabilities can have\nrepresentatives or surrogates who enable them to participate, at least\nvicariously, in most social and political activities (2009; but see\nWasserman and McMahan 2012 for limits on meaningful surrogate agency);\nFrancis discusses \u201cmental prostheses\u201d that aid in\nconstructing a personal conception of the good. She offers, as an\nexample of a mental prosthesis, an actual device that allows people\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s to locate objects in their houses by touching\nan icon on their computer screen. The use of that device would not\ndeny the user agency in locating the device, any more than a\nprosthetic foot would deny its bearer agency in running (Francis 2009:\n203\u2013204). Such a device could also allow cognitively disabled\npersons to communicate their preferences, but it is unclear how it\nenables them to form a conception of the good.\n\nThese are different approaches to securing the well-being of people\nwith cognitive impairments, with different purposes. Nussbaum seeks to\nfacilitate the exercise of, or the capacity for, valuable functionings\nsuch as social affiliation, meaningful work, and political activity.\nFrancis\u2019s goal is broader and less concrete: to promote the\nparticipation of people with cognitive impairments in developing\nconceptions of the good that accord with their desires and that offer\nreasonable prospects for fulfillment.\n\nBoth approaches receive some support from empirical research.\nDisability theorists such as Goode 1994 and Ferguson 2001\nmaintain that people with significant cognitive and communicative\nimpairments can and do have the capacity to choose among alternatives\nif those choices can be formulated in ways they can comprehend, or if\ntheir non-impaired intimates or caregivers can learn to read the ways\nin which they actually express their preferences, in order to help\nthem make their lives go the way they want.\n1.4 The Claimed Neutrality of Disability\n\nMany plausible accounts of well-being can explain why life can and\noften does go comparably well for people with most disabilities\nrelative to people without disabilities. There are unresolved issues\nabout how broadly the objective elements of well-being can be framed\nwithout becoming so broad as to lose distinct content. But these\nquestions may be less about disability and more about objective list\ntheories generally.\n\nSome philosophers have argued more affirmatively that disabilities are\n\u201cneutral\u201d characteristics or \u201cmere\ndifferences\u201d, with no average or generally adverse impact on\nwell-being. They argue that disability should be regarded as a\ncharacteristic like race or sex, which are widely seen as neutral with\nrespect to well-being, once discrimination and its effects are\nfactored out\u2014or even if they are not. Disability is grouped with\nthese characteristics in anti-discrimination law. But it is also\ngrouped with those characteristics by writers who argue, more\nambitiously, that disability, no less than race or sex, is a neutral\ncharacteristic\u2014one that, in the absence of social exclusion,\ndoes not make lives go any worse on average (Barnes 2009a;\nMcBryde-Johnson 2003).\nThese writers do not deny that becoming disabled may make life go\nworse for some time, but no more so than other wrenching changes, like\nlosing a job, home, or loved one. In the former case as well as the\nlatter, the bad or harm is in the transition\u2014in the loss and\ndisruption\u2014and not in the end state. Any disadvantage that\npersists after the transition is plausibly attributed to social\nfactors.\n\nThere are various ways to distinguish disabilities, on the one hand,\nfrom neutral characteristics like race and sex, on the other. The\ndistinction can be easily made on a maximalist view of well-being\nwhich holds that life is presumptively better with more valuable\ncapacities. In contrast to race and sex, disabilities, by definition,\ninvolve fewer valuable capacities, so they presumptively make life go\nworse. It is simply better to have more senses, more intelligence, and\na greater range of motion, even if they do not make one happier, have\nlimited practical value, and do not advance one\u2019s specific\nprojects. This view regards standard disabilities as among the most\nsalient limitations to which humanity is subject. Less is always\nworse, although how much worse will depend on contingent\ncircumstances. But many philosophers reject maximalism, in part\nbecause they balk at the implication that we should strive to acquire,\nand bear children who will possess, the greatest number and range of\npossible capacities. \n\nJeff McMahan offers a non-maximalist argument against the neutrality\nof disabilities, based on a view of how people with single impairments\nflourish despite them:\n\n\nA single disability may seem neutral because it can be compensated for\nby other abilities that develop to fulfill its functions. Blindness,\nfor example, may be compensated for by the enhancement of other\nsenses, particularly hearing. But if disabilities were individually\nentirely neutral, they ought also to be neutral in combination; but\nthey are not (2005: 96).\n\n\nSome might dispute McMahan\u2019s claim that disabilities cannot be\nneutral in combination, but our focus here is his claim that\nneutrality for individual disabilities implies neutrality in\ncombination. In support of this claim, he argues the effects of\ndisabilities on well-being \u201care largely additive\u201d, because\nwith each further disability, it becomes harder to compensate for\nother disabilities. This argument assumes that the possibility of\nliving as well without as with any given ability depends on the\npossibility of compensating for its absence. This assumption may be\nmistaken: the possibility of flourishing with a single disability may\ndepend not on compensation but on what we could call\n\u201csaturation\u201d. A blind person can live as well as a sighted\none not because she develops better hearing\u2014she may\nnot\u2014but just because the senses and abilities she has are more\nthan adequate to allow her to live as fully and richly as possible. As\nAsch and Wasserman argue:\n\n\n[H]uman beings enjoy a fortunate redundancy in many of the capacities\nthat are instrumental for, or constitutive of, valuable human goods\nand activities, from intimate relationships to rewarding work. Humans\nwith a standard complement of senses and motor functions rarely use\nall of these functions in achieving such goods, and humans lacking\nthose skills can use only some. But those are usually sufficient (2005: 208\n).\n\n\nThere may be a limited number of ways to realize important human goods\nlike rich aesthetic experience, and those with disabilities may have\nfewer ways to do so. But the ways they have may be as good as the ways\nthey lack, and employing the ones they have need not be seen as\ncompensating for their inability to employ the ones they lack. Having\nmore ways to realize a good does not mean that you can realize it more\nfully.\n\nThis response, however, suggests two final sources of difference, both\nof which involve what we might call \u201cwelfare security\u201d.\nEven if people with a single major disability can live as well as\npeople without one, 1) it requires more effort or luck for them to do\nso, and 2) they are at greater risk of lacking the means to do so. The\nfirst claim is that the fewer means there are to achieve a particular\ngood like rich aesthetic experience, the more difficult it may be to\nachieve it. An individual who can meet his aesthetic quota, so to\nspeak, with sunsets or symphonies, doesn\u2019t have to work as hard\nor need as aesthetically rich an environment as one who can meet his\nquota only with symphonies. The second claim is that people with\nsingle disabilities are at greater risk than people without any\ndisabilities of losing the means to achieve various goods, since they\nhave a smaller surplus or reserve. The plausibility of these claims\ndepends on a myriad of unresolved issues: Is there an irreducible\nplurality of objective goods and if so, how they are individuated? Are\nthere a limited number of means for attaining those goods? If it\nrequires greater effort to attain a particular good with fewer\nfunctions, does that additional effort itself enhance or reduce\nwell-being?\n\nAnother argument for the conclusion that disabilities entail setbacks\nto well-being is suggested by the human variation model (Scotch and\nShriner 1997). This treats disabilities not as a distinct category,\nbut as conditions falling on a continuum of physical or mental\ndifference. It is not intrinsically disadvantageous to be near the end\nof such a continuum but may be disadvantageous in a society in which\nonly a small proportion of people fall near that end. This is because\nmany of the physical structures and social practices of that society\nwill inevitably be designed for its average members. No matter how\njust a society, how committed to inclusion, there would still be some\ndisadvantage in being toward the end of the spectrum. There may be\nsome truth to this claim, but it is easy to overstate. Universal\ndesign advocates argue that it is, or will become, feasible to build\nstructures and practices that fully or equally accommodate individuals\nacross large ranges of human variation. Even if their claims are also\noverstated, they suggest a need for caution in concluding that\nminority status is intrinsically disadvantageous.\n\nPerhaps the most tenacious source of resistance to the \u201cmere\ndifference\u201d claim comes from a stubborn asymmetry, which appears to\ndistinguish disability from race and sex and to challenge its\nneutrality. We generally seek to prevent individuals who are not\ndisabled from becoming disabled, but not vice-versa. We strongly\nsupport measures to prevent disability, if prevention can be\naccomplished without coercion, harmful side effects, or the loss or\ndisruption of personal or narrative identity. Consider a form of\nprevention widely seen as unproblematic: taking folic acid during\npregnancy to prevent spina bifida. Some governments mandate that\ncertain food be enriched with folic acid. These mandates are\ncontroversial, but the controversy concerns the issues of involuntary\nmedication and possible side-effects rather than the intended\npreventative effect. Few, if any, disability advocates object to these\nmandates, any more than they object to the myriad safety measures\nimposed by the modern state, from requiring seat belts to restricting\nteratogenic drugs. Many object to the needlessly grim depiction of\ndisability in some safety campaigns; few to the campaigns\nthemselves (Emens 2012).\n\nNo such asymmetry exists for other allegedly neutral characteristics.\nThere would be strong opposition to government measures to prevent\nthem, alter them, or reduce their incidence. Imagine that a dietary\nsupplement as safe as folic acid could alter the sex of the fetus, or\nlighten its complexion. We suspect that most people would find it\ntroublesome for pregnant women to take that drug voluntarily, let\nalone for the government to put it in the food supply. Or imagine a\nfluoride-like substance with a similar effect, which could be safely\nadded to the water supply. Fluoridation to prevent female sex or dark\nskin would strike most people as offensive, even though it would not\nprevent the existence of anyone on the basis of a disfavored\ncharacteristic, at least if personal identity survives alteration of\nrace or sex. The claim that women or people of color lead worse lives\non average due to pervasive discrimination would not be seen as a\njustification for changing sex or race. Undertaken by an individual,\nit would be seen as complicit with sexism or racism regardless of its\nmotivation; undertaken by the state, it would be seen as an egregious\nexpression of racism or sexism. Public health measures to prevent\ndisability, like dietary supplements, would not provoke similar\nobjections. In general, measures to alter other significant\ncharacteristics\u2014not only race and sex, but minority cultures,\nsexual orientations, and social identities\u2014would be considered\nunjustifiable or only justifiable in special circumstances. By\ncontrast, measures to prevent disabilities are considered\npresumptively acceptable.\n\nThe contrast between sex and race, on one hand, and disability on the\nother, is especially striking in light of the fact that in the former,\nmeasures to alter stigmatized social identities are often regarded as\nmore objectionable than measures to alter dominant social identities\nthat are not stigmatized. Just the reverse is true for disability.\nGiving deaf children cochlear implants is somewhat controversial;\ndeafening hearing children would be considered criminal abuse. And\nthis would be so even if the children were too young to have the\nself-conscious experience of hearing, had no other effects from being\ndeafened, and faced no discrimination on the basis of deafness. These\ncontrasts raise the question of whether the asymmetry with respect to\ndisability-prevention is compatible with the view that disabilities\nare neutral characteristics\u2014that they do not make life go worse\noverall.\n\nRecently, Elizabeth Barnes has sought to challenge this perceived\nasymmetry between measures to prevent or correct disabilities and\nother significant characteristics. She attributes much of the\nobjection to changing sex or gender to moral considerations equally\napplicable to \u201ccorrecting\u201d disability: 1) they would\nviolate the individual\u2019s right to control her own body unless\nconsented to; if consented to, they would be permissible elective\nprocedures (as would, Barnes maintains, procedures to create\ndisabilities); and 2) such procedures generally involve considerable\nloss and transition costs\u2014but so do procedures to correct\ndisabilities, as many \u201ccure\u201d narratives attest. For\npreventative measures not involving bodily modification, loss, or\ntransition costs, Barnes argues that the claimed difference between\npreventing disabilities and preventing less favored races or sexual\norientations is simply question-begging\u2014no good reason has been\ngiven to accept the former and reject the latter, merely the\n\u201cnegative-difference\u201d view the intuition is supposed to\nsupport. \n\nBarnes\u2019 argument, not surprisingly, has proven controversial.\nSeveral commentators sympathetic with mere-difference claims for some\ndisabilities have questioned Barnes categorical claim for all\ndisabilities; others have questioned whether she is too quick to\naccuse those claiming an asymmetry in the case of preventative\nmeasures of begging the question (see Dougherty 2014).\n\nYet even if disability could be regarded as neutral if other features\ncontingently associated with it, such as social exclusion, physical\npain, and the loss of valued functions, are factored out, that\nconclusion might have limited practical significance for decision\nmakers who cannot factor out those features. As noted earlier, the\nquestion of whether it is disadvantageous may have a different answer\nfor those who can significantly modify the physical and social\nenvironment and those who cannot. Many decision makers, from\nprospective parents to healthcare policy makers, will fall in the\nlatter category.\n\nBefore discussing specific decision making contexts, then, we need to\nconsider arguments that significant disabilities can be neutral, in\nthe sense of not reducing overall well-being, even if various\ncontingent harmful features are not excluded. We will examine two\ngrounds for claiming that disabilities, including painful, disruptive,\nand stigmatized ones, need not reduce overall well-being, although\nthey may still be conditions worth preventing: 1) if disabilities deny\nsome valuable experiences and achievements, they provide others, which\nmay not be accessible, or may be less accessible, to nondisabled\npeople; and 2) there is a non-additive relationship between parts or\naspects of a life and life as a whole.\n\nBarnes (2009a) argues that having a disability can make an\nindividual\u2019s life more difficult and challenging at some points\nwithout making it go worse overall, or even making it more probable\nthat it will. The challenges of disability are like those of other\nminority characteristics such as homosexuality; facing those\nchallenges can give a life greater depth or direction. For example,\nsome individuals who are disabled in adolescence or adulthood find\nthat their previously shallow or aimless lives gained focus and\npurpose from the challenges they faced, and some individuals find that\nthey acquired new skills or interests more rewarding than those\nprecluded by their impairments. Because such enriching responses are\nso common, there is no basis for concluding that people with\ndisabilities have a lower quality of life overall. But because\ndisabilities \n\n\nare, in general, the kinds of things that make life harder\u2014they\nimpose limitations, they cause pain, they subject their bearers to\nstigmas and discrimination (2009a: 339) \n\n\n\u2014they are associated with with harms and should be prevented in\nsome circumstances. They should not, however, be regarded as\n\u201cnegative difference-makers\u201d\u2014conditions that\nnecessarily make lives worse overall.\n\nIn blocking the inference from disability as a harm to disability as a\nnegative difference-maker, Barnes adduces instances of the positive\nconsequences that disabilities have had for specific individuals,\ndespite or sometimes because of the \u201clocal\u201d hardships they\ncause. It may be, however, that no positive consequences are needed to\n\u201cneutralize\u201d the hardships associated with a disability.\nThose hardships may simply get absorbed in the immense complex of\nfactors that make a life go better or worse. It is only on a simple\nadditive view of the relationship of parts to whole that a local harm\nwould necessarily make a life go worse unless compensated for. It is\ndifficult to be more precise about the impact of disability on whole\nlives, however, because it is not clear how the goodness or badness of\nparts of a life contribute to the goodness of the whole, on either\nobjective or subjective accounts of well-being (Feldman 2008). David Velleman has argued\nthat whatever one\u2019s particular theory of individual well-being,\nthe parts of a life do not contribute to the goodness of a life\nadditively. That is, the goodness of a whole life is not the sum of\nthe goodness of its parts. Instead, the goodness of a whole life is to\nbe understood in terms of the narrative relations between its various\nparts. From this perspective, successes or failures at particular\ntimes in one\u2019s life can retrospectively alter the meaning or\nsignificance of earlier ones (Velleman 1991).\n\nRecent accounts of noncomparative harm (Harman 2009; Shiffrin 2012,\n1999) provide additional reasons to challenge the inference from\ndisability as harm to disability as negative difference-maker. These\naccounts reject the prevailing, counterfactual analysis of harm as a\nsetback to an individual\u2019s interests with reference to some\nbaseline\u2014her past, her expectations, or the average of her group\nor society. Instead, they understand harms as fundamentally bad states\nor events, like pain, disability, and death; states or events that\n(proponents of these accounts claim) can be regarded as bad without\nreference to any baseline. On these views, an individual is harmed\nmerely by suffering pain or injury, regardless of whether that pain or\ninjury leaves her worse off overall. She is harmed by painful\nlife-saving surgery, although that averts a greater harm, or\nlife-transforming disability, although her life may go much better as\na result.\n\nObviously a critical question for these accounts is what makes\nsomething a noncomparative harm (Bradley 2012). Harman (2009) offers\nno general characterization of noncomparative harms; Shiffrin\ncharacterizes such harms in terms of a significant chasm, conflict, or\nother form of significant disconnect between one\u2019s will and\none\u2019s circumstances (2012: 388). Disabilities, injuries, and\nillnesses and typically regarded as harms in these terms because they\n\u201coften significantly impede one\u2019s capacity to achieve\nsubstantial congruity between one\u2019s will and one\u2019s life\n(2012: 384). Shiffrin recognizes both that one\u2019s circumstances\nmay narrow that chasm considerably, and she considers it a strength of\nher account \u201cthat it can recognize quotidian conditions such as\nordinary conditions as harms\u201d (2012: 387, n. 46). Although\nShiffrin does not take this additional step, it would seem that if\nordinary conditions can be harmful in damaging one\u2019s agency,\nextraordinary ones can be harmless, if they were congenital,\npredictable, or successfully adapted to, such that congruity between\none\u2019s will and one\u2019s life is never lost, or is quickly\nrestored. Further, although Harman and Shiffrin, like Barnes, regard\nthe onset of most disabilities as harms, they also, like Barnes, hold\nthat such harms need not make life go worse overall.\n\nAnother factor associated with disability\u2014reduced\nlifespan\u2014arguably has an adverse impact on well-being. Many\ndisabilities, or their associated disease processes, result in\nlower-than-average life expectancy, though it is worth emphasizing\nthat the relationship between disability and reduced lifespan is\ncontingent, and so even if reduced lifespan necessarily reduces\nwell-being, it would not follow that disability necessarily reduces\nwell-being. Moreover, it is not clear that reduced lifespan\nnecessarily reduces well-being. It is at least arguable that living to\n80, with the last 5 years of one\u2019s life in severe pain, does not\nyield more well-being than a life of 75 relatively painless years. And\nit is at least arguable that longer lives correlate with greater\nwell-being because they enable one to pass through all of life\u2019s\nstages\u2014childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, middle age, and\ngradual aging\u2014but that having passed through all of life\u2019s\nstages, additional years yield small increases in well-being. Clearly,\nthese are complicated issues that deserve more attention. We simply\nnote that there is no straightforward inference to be drawn from\ndisability\u2019s correlation with reduced lifespan to\ndisability\u2019s having an adverse effect on well-being. \n1.5 The Impact of Disability on Well-Being: What is at Stake?\n\nThis subsection will examine how assumptions about the relationship\nbetween disability and well-being that have been challenged in\nacademic debate continue to play a significant role in reproductive\nand health-care decision making. We discuss four contexts in which\nthese assumptions have been relied upon in policies and personal\ndecisions about creating or sustaining lives: reproductive testing for\ndisability, neonatal care, \u201cend-of-life\u201c decision making,\nand the use of \u201dquality-adjustment\u201d measures to assess the\ncost-effectiveness of health-care and other interventions.\n\nIn all of these cases, objections have been raised besides those\nconcerning the assumption that lives with serious disabilities must be\nsubstantially worse than lives without them. For example, in the case\nof life-termination, the debate also concerns the decisional capacity\nof newly disabled individuals; in the case of quality-adjustment, the\ndebate also concerns the assumption that the quality of a life should\naffect its priority in allocating scarce resources. We will, however,\nfocus on the objections that concern well-being.\n1.5.1 Reproductive testing\n\nSome prospective parents see life with some disabilities as worse than\nno life at all. This claim is often made with respect to such\nconditions as Tay-Sachs, Lesch-Nyan, and trisomies 13 and 18. Even for\nthose conditions, however, that view is not universally held\n(Wilkinson 2011). The notion of a life so bad that it is a harm to the\nindividual living it came to popular and philosophical attention in\nthe 1980s, when a number of lawsuits in the U.S claimed that\nphysicians or parents had wronged the child by failing to diagnose its\ncondition in utero and/or prevent its birth. These lawsuits appeared\nto require a comparison of existence and non-existence, which most\ncourts and some philosophers rejected. A majority of philosophers,\nhowever, starting with Joel Feinberg (1986), have concluded that the\nnotion can be useful in theory if not necessarily in practice.\n\nIn cases involving less severe disabilities, some prospective parents\nthink that they are protecting the welfare of \u201ctheir\nchild\u201d by preventing the existence of a child who would have a\ndisability. This attitude involves seeing the future child not as a\nparticular individual who can only exist with a disability, but as a\nrole that prospective parents do not want to fill with a disabled\nchild. Philosophers have debated the appropriateness of regarding\nfuture children in this way (Malek 2008; Hare 2007; Velleman 2008;\nWasserman 2008; Heyd 2009). Even if this view were appropriate, its\nmoral force would depend on the extent to which the diagnosed\ncondition could reasonably be expected to reduce the child\u2019s\nwelfare, as well as the existence and strength of a moral reason not\nto bring into existence persons with such welfare deficits.\n\nIn the context of prenatal testing, as with assessments of adult\nfunctioning, the extent to which a disabling condition reduces\nwell-being depends on the conception of well-being that is adopted.\nWith prenatal testing, however, there is an additional complication:\nthere is massive uncertainty about how the detected variants will be\nexpressed in the developing child. That depends on their their\ninterplay with other genes and interaction with a variety of\nenvironments. The formidable challenges of predicting phenotype may be\nmore readily acknowledged by health professionals than the even more\ndaunting challenges in the non-medical assessment of how life with a\ngiven phenotype could go for the person living it.\n1.5.2 Withdrawal of Life Support from Disabled Newborns\n\nThe debate over the withdrawal of life support for very premature and\nseverely disabled newborns surfaced in the 1980s with the 1982\nBloomington, Indiana Baby Doe case and the adoption of\nfederal guidelines for support of newborns and termination of\nlife-sustaining treatment. The debate continues as medical technology\npermits an increasing number of severely disabled newborns to survive.\nSome of the debate appears fairly abstract, concerning whether there\nshould be a \u201cgrey area\u201d around \u201ca life (just barely)\nworth living\u201d, in which parents and physicians would be\npermitted to decide for themselves whether to continue or withdraw\nlife-support (Wilkinson 2011). Disability scholars, however, have the\nmore practical concern that decisions about life-support, whether made\nby parents or caretakers, too often rely on inaccurate or misleading\nmedical indicators of expected well-being, resulting in significant\ndiscrimination against newborns with disabilities (Silvers and Francis\n2011). Although the\naccuracy of medical prediction may improve after birth, it remains\ndifficult to assess the potential of a neonate to develop higher\ncognitive functions. And although the prediction of the course of\nphysical impairments has improved, that improvement offers only a\npartial safeguard against the tendency of many parents and health\nprofessionals to exaggerate the hardships of life with an\nimpairment\u2014a tendency driven as much by stigma as by medical\nerror and uncertainty.\n1.5.3 \u201cEnd-of-Life\u201d Decision Making\n\nAssumptions about disability and well-being play an important if\nsomewhat less salient role in this context. They figure most\nprominently when the individual is no longer capable of deciding for\nherself whether to receive, continue or refuse life-sustaining\ntreatment. For adults once capable of making such decisions, two\nstandards apply to surrogate decision making: substituted\njudgment and best interest. The first involves judging\nwhat the individual would have wanted or chosen if she could want or\nchoose for her current situation; the second involves judging the\nperson\u2019s interests by a standard other than her own. In cases\nwhere the adult never had decisional capacity and there is no basis\nfor making a judgment about what the patient would have chosen, the\nbest interest standard applies. But those who judge the best interests\nof such an adult are prone to the same errors of projection as\nnondisabled people judging the well-being of disabled people. A\nnondisabled surrogate might be devastated at losing capacities the\ncognitively impaired individual never had, or assume that the\ninability to understand the source of, or reason for, physical pain\nmust be even more traumatic for that individual than it would be for\nthe surrogate. Such judgments are not clearly wrong, but rather\nspeculative; the primary error is in overconfidence.\n\nAssumptions about disability and well-being also play a significant\nrole in judging the reasonableness of requests by competent adults to\nend, or not receive, life sustaining treatment. Many jurisdictions\nrecognize the right of such individuals to make this decision for\nthemselves, but disability advocates remain concerned that their\ndecisions are more likely to be considered reasonable, and respected,\nif they are made in response to severe, permanent disabilities. Thus,\nin the influential case of Elizabeth Bouvia, the court allowed a fully\ncompetent, severely disabled, women to refuse the medical support that\ncould have prolonged her life indefinitely. Critics of the decision\nmaintained that both Bouvia and the court were unduly swayed by the\nperceived indignity of her physical dependence, and by their\ndifficulty in seeing how life could go very well with a severe\ndisability (Asch 2005; Gill 1992; Longmore 1987).\n1.5.4 Health Related Quality-of-Life Measures\n\nPerhaps the setting in which the relationship of disability to\nwell-being has received most attention is the assessment of\n\u201cquality of life\u201d (see, generally, Wasserman, et al.\n2005a). For judging the cost-effectiveness of medical interventions,\nit is useful to have measures of well-being that facilitate\nquantitative comparison. Quality-of-life measures in medicine and\nhealth care offer benchmarks for assessing the well-being of groups of\npeople, focusing on the aspects of well-being most amenable to\nreliable assessment. There is no guarantee that individuals who are\ndoing well by such measures are actually living good lives according\nto more robust philosophical criteria of well-being. Any uniform\nmetric for quality of life will provide an oversimplified assessment\nof an individual\u2019s well-being, and to some extent this is\nunavoidable from a policy perspective. But the worry when these\njudgments are applied to people with disabilities is not\noversimplification so much as systematic bias.\n\nAssumptions about the adverse effect of disability on well-being\npervade the measurement of \u201chealth-related quality of\nlife\u201d (HRQL). In particular, two features of many standard\napproaches to measuring HRQL treat disability as inimical to\nwell-being: 1) assuming that an individual\u2019s adaptation to a\ndisability is a source of distortion or a measurement artifact in\nassessing how well he or she is doing; 2) expanding the definition of\nhealth outcomes to include not only the physiological and\nsensory-motor effects of disease and injury, but their\n\u201csequelae\u201d\u2014their effect on daily living and social\nparticipation. The first feature ignores the extent to which\nadaptation involves changes that would count as improvements in\nwell-being on most objective as well as subjective accounts (Menzel\net al. 2002; Barnes 2009a). The second fails to distinguish the\ncontribution of medical and social/environmental factors to the\nrestriction or loss of objectively valuable activities (Wasserman, et\nal. 2005a). These features not only exaggerate the adverse impact of\ndisabilities, but in some contexts, threaten adverse consequences for\npeople with disabilities.\n\nThe inclusion of functional and activity limitations as health\noutcomes is in tension with the social model of disability, which\ntreats many of those limitations as due to an exclusionary\nenvironment. It also conflicts with the view, discussed below, that an\nindividual can be disabled but healthy. The assumption that adaptation\nto disability cannot be an accurate measure of well-being has\nmotivated a reliance on health professionals to assess the quality of\nlife with specific disabilities, rather than on people with those\ndisabilities (Murray 1996). The refusal to treat people with\ndisabilities as reliable witnesses to, or authorities on, their\nwell-being is particularly striking, given that nondisabled people\nalso adapt to the vicissitudes of their lives (Brickman and Campbell\n1971). As Wasserman, et al. note:\n\n\nThe lives of people with disabilities are assumed to be of low\nquality, whatever environmental factors mediate the impact of their\nimpairments, and their own testimony to the contrary is seen as\ninherently unreliable. Their adaptations to their impairments appear\nnot as instances of the universal processes of adjustment to changed\ncircumstances, but as disability-specific strategies for recovering\nthe ground that has been lost, or for covering up its loss through\nbenign self-deception (2005a: 11).\n\n\nThis view of disability is not merely inaccurate. Its use to assess\nthe effectiveness of health care interventions has disturbing\nimplications for the lives of people with disabilities. Effectiveness\nmeasures typically treat a disability as equivalent for assessment\npurposes to a shorter life-span. Health outcomes are measured by\nlife-years saved or gained; life-years are \u201cadjusted\u201d by\ntheir quality, and their rated quality is substantially reduced if the\nintervention fails to correct, risks causing, or causes a disability.\nAs a result, people who have, or will be left with, disabilities also\nhave their future life-years adjusted downward in light of the\npresumed lower quality of those life-years. As a result, the priority\nof persons with disabilities for life-saving interventions is\nsubstantially reduced. Because it employed such discounting, the 1990\nOregon Health Care Plan to set priorities for Medicaid-funded\nprocedures was found to discriminate against people with disabilities\n(Bodenheimer 1997). Several years later, the most comprehensive\ninternational effort to develop summary measures of population health\nproposed a more explicit and very sharp discounting of lives with\ndisabilities in assessing the \u201cGlobal Burden of Disease\u201d\nand in setting priorities for its reduction (Murray 1996). Although\nsome objectionable features of the discounting methodology have been\nmodified (Saloman and Murray 2002), the Global Burden of Disease\nframeworks continue to adopt procedures that result in strikingly low\nquality-of-life estimates for many disabilities.\n\nMany mainstream philosophers and bioethicists question the use of\nsummary health measures in priority setting (Harris 1987; Brock 1995).\nThey argue that their proposed use is based either on a questionable\nutilitarian assessment of lives as more valuable if they\n\u201ccontain\u201d more utility, or on the controversial\ndistributive principle that society should give scarce goods to those\nwho will benefit most from them. But many still defend the general\nassumptions about disability and quality of life that informed those\nmeasures (Brock 2005). Other philosophers and disability scholars have\nchallenged these assumptions (Bickenbach 2005). Some have gone even\nfurther, questioning whether quality-of-life assessments place an\nexaggerated premium on the prevention or correction of impairments\nthat do not, in hospitable environments, preclude rich and rewarding\nlives (Barnes 2009a; Asch and Wasserman 2010).\n2. Disability and Health\n\nPeople appear to regard health as one of the most important goods,\nmore important than wealth, status, or professional success. Health is\nseen as special in part for instrumental reasons, because it is\nthought to be a prerequisite for many or most other goods. So the\nrelationship of health to disability is an issue of central concern\nfor those who seek to replace or supplement a medical model of\ndisability (Bickenbach 1993; Shakespeare 2006).\n\nThe social model of disability, which informs the Americans with\nDisabilities Act and kindred legislation, may appear to move\ndisability away from health policy and toward civil rights. Yet\nmovement in one direction does not preclude movement in the other.\nPeople with disabilities have significant health care needs, and their\nneeds may depend to some extent upon their disabilities. For\nphilosophers as well as policy makers, the challenge posed by the\nsocial model is to acknowledge the importance of health and health\ncare for people with disabilities without assuming that all people\nwith disabilities are unhealthy just because they are disabled, and\nwithout overemphasizing the correction or mitigation of impairments.\nThis requires a careful examination of the relationship between health\nand disability. Do all disabilities result from, or in, a loss of\nhealth? Can a person with a disability be in good or even\n\u201cperfect\u201d health? To answer such questions, we need a\nserviceable theory, concept, or definition of health.\n\nThere are a variety of competing philosophical accounts of health (see\n SEP entry on concepts of health and disease).\n They can be distinguished in several ways: 1) some regard health as\nthe mere absence of disease (e.g., Hofman 2005); others regard health\nas a form of well-being or flourishing, and treat the absence of\ndisease as at most a necessary condition of health (e.g., Carel 2007\nand WHO 1948); 2) some regard the concept of health as value-laden, or\nnormative, in the sense that the good of health enters into its very\nconcept (e.g., Engelhardt 1986; DeVito 2000); others regard health as\nvalue-neutral, or non-normative, defined by bio-statistical or other\nbiological criteria (e.g., Boorse 1987 and Wachbroit 1998); 3) some\nsee the value of health as instrumental, in the capacity of the agent\nor organism to achieve certain goals (e.g., Nordenfeldt 1995); others\nsee its value as intrinsic as well, as good in itself (e.g., Becker\n2005).\n\nThese distinctions are not independent of each other. Non-normative\naccounts of health tend to treat health as the absence of disease,\ndysfunction, or deformity. These accounts also tend to be\ninstrumental: they define health as normal or species-typical\nbiological functioning, which is itself defined in such goal-oriented\nterms as survival and reproduction. On the other hand, instrumental\naccounts that define health in terms of the pursuit of an\nindividually, culturally, or other variable range of goals will tend\nto weaken the connection of health to bodily, cognitive, or affective\nfunctioning.\n\nIf health is defined simply as the absence of disease, then a person\ncan be disabled but healthy if and only if he can be disabled but not\ndiseased. If, however, health is a state of psychophysical flourishing\nor vitality, then an individual can be healthy, although perhaps not\nperfectly healthy, even if disabled or diseased, and unhealthy even if\nfree of disability or disease.\n\nMany philosophers and bioethicists take it that \u201chealth\u201d,\n\u201cdisease\u201d, and \u201cdisability\u201d are value-laden,\nthat it is part of their meaning that the conditions to which they\nrefer are (inherently) desirable or undesirable (e.g., Engelhardt 1986\nand DeVito 2000). Two notable exceptions are Christopher Boorse and\nRobert Wachbroit, who offer biomedical definitions that are\nvalue-neutral, or as Boorse claims, as value-neutral as biology itself\n(Boorse 1987: 359\u201393; Wachbroit 1998: 533\u201338). They define\nhealth in terms of normal or species-typical physical and mental\nfunctioning, so that disabilities are by definition unhealthy. But\nsuch value-neutral accounts do not assume that disabilities are\ntherefore bad or undesirable, merely\n atypical.[2]\n\nSince they deny that the goodness of health is part of its definition,\nvalue-neutral accounts stress the enormous, but contingent,\ninstrumental value of health. The leading attempt to explain the\nimportance of health in these terms is Daniels\u2019 account of\nhealth-care as maintaining or restoring fair equality of opportunity\n(Daniels 1985). Daniels\u2019 account gives a priority to the\nmaintenance of typical functioning and the correction of disabilities\nthat many critics find excessive (Wasserman 1998: 152\u201358).\nStill, the core intuition, concerning the enormous practical value of\nspecies-typical functioning, can be accepted without accepting medical\nnormalization as the preferred or default response to atypicality;\nindeed, without accepting the claim that species have functions with\nspecies- typical levels defined in biological terms (see Amundson\n2000). Further, the claim that species-typical functioning is\ninstrumentally valuable leaves open the question of why\ndepartures from species-typical functioning are instrumentally\ndisvaluable: is it because they render one vulnerable to\ndiscrimination, subject one to an unaccommodating environment, cause\nmedical problems, or all of the above?\n\nYet most people have a strong conviction that practical advantages do\nnot exhaust the value of health, nor practical disadvantages its\ndisvalue. To accommodate this conviction, those accepting a narrow\ndefinition of health as the absence of disease may want to acknowledge\nthat disease, or its usual symptoms or consequences, has inherent\ndisvalue, while distinguishing disability from the other symptoms or\nconsequences of disease, particularly pain and death. Those adopting a\nbroader definition of health as an aspect of well-being or flourishing\nmay also want to claim that being unhealthy has inherent disvalue,\nwhile distinguishing disability from a lack of health.\n2.1 The First Approach: Distinguishing Disability from Disease\n\nThe distinction between disease and disability has received\nsurprisingly little attention in the philosophical literature. Most\nstatutory and other official definitions either treat serious diseases\nas disabilities or make \u201cimpairment\u201d, \u201closs of\nfunction\u201d, or \u201cstructural/functional abnormality\u201d an\nelement of disability, leaving the relationship of disease to\ndisability unclear (e.g., Americans with Disabilities Act, 1990 or\nDisability Discrimination Act, 1995). One of the few detailed analyses\nof the relationship between disease and disability was offered by Ron\nAmundson, who proposed that disability should be understood as one of\nthe three general consequences of disease, along with pain and death\n(Amundson 1992: 105\u2013119). Amundson adopted Boorse\u2019s\nvalue-neutral account of health, but argued that Boorse defined\n\u201cdisease\u201d too broadly, as a \u201cdeviation from the\nfunctional organization of typical members of a species\u201d\u2014a\ndefinition which would encompass most disabilities. Amundson contended\nthat it was both clearer and closer to common usage to treat disease\nas an atypical process that tended to result in disability, pain, or\n death.[3]\n\nAmundson defined disability as the loss or deviation from a particular\nkind of species-typical function: action at the personal level, e.g.,\nthe inability to move one\u2019s arm, as opposed to the inability to\nmetabolize sugar. Disabilities that are not products of a process that\nleads to pain, death, or further impairment are not symptomatic of\ndisease in Amundson\u2019s sense. They are consistent with health\nnarrowly defined. Yet some philosophers (Hausman 2001: 254) find the\nnotion that individuals can be in excellent health if they are blind,\ndeaf, or paraplegic sufficiently implausible to count against analyses\nof health with that implication.\n\nThe disagreement between Amundson and Boorse on the distinction\nbetween disease and disability is not just a matter of semantics. The\ncritical point in Amundson\u2019s analysis is a practical one.\nMedical interventions are the presumptive response to disease; they\nseek to slow, arrest, or reverse processes that cause pain and may\nlead to physiological dysfunction, (further) disability (in\nAmundson\u2019s terms), or death. But on Amundson\u2019s view, which\nmakes disability consistent with health, the presumptive response to\ndisability need not be medical as opposed to environmental or social.\nFurthermore, the loss of opportunity associated with disabilities can\noften be prevented or mitigated more effectively and (in the long run)\nmore economically by modifying the physical and social environment\nthan by medical intervention. This is true even though environmental\nmeasures are likely to fare poorly against medical interventions in\nthe competition for scarce resources, because of the prestige and\nperceived importance of medical treatment. The failure to distinguish\ndisease and disability, and the tendency to favor a medical response\nfor both, reflects the sway of the medical model, and offers a clear\nillustration of how it differs from the social model (see\n SEP entry on disability: definitions, models, experience).\n\nRecently, Peter Hucklenbroich has proposed a harm-oriented account of\nhealth as the absence of a \u201cdisease\u201d process. Such a\nprocess is pathological in the sense that:\n\nit is immediately lethal or definitely life-shortening, [or]\nit is a condition of pain, suffering, or other specific\ncomplaints, [or]\nit is a condition of infertility (incapability of biological\nreproduction), [or]\nit is a condition of inability or impairment for living together\nin human symbiotic communities, [or]\nit is a non-universal disposition of the organism to develop a\ncondition that is pathological according to one or more of these\ncriteria.\n (12)[4]\n\n\nHucklenbroich\u2019s account defines health in terms of a list of\nreasonably health-specific harms and it restricts health to the\nabsence of biological conditions that either (a) directly\ninvolve harm or (b) dispose one to suffer harm.\n\nAn account along these lines may have the potential to distinguish\ndisease from disability so as to make the former immediately relevant\nto well-being in a way the latter is not. Unlike purely non-normative\naccounts, it only finds a health-decrement where something bad comes\nfrom the state of the body. Unlike capaciously normative accounts, it\ndefines these \u201cbads\u201d in terms of a general and\nhealth-specific harm; not just any body-based limitation on the\npursuit of our (potentially idiosyncratic) goals makes us unhealthy.\nAnd finally, defining health in terms of bodily dispositions\ncould help to explain why extrinsic factors, like those cited by\nsocial models of disability, are irrelevant to health. It could\ndistinguish between harms that come from social responses to the body\nfrom harms that come from the body itself; thereby distinguishing\nbetween harms that generate claims on health care and harms that\ngenerate claims against discrimination or the denial of fair equality\nof opportunity.\n\nDespite the importance of distinguishing disease from disability,\nthere are at least three reasons why it is difficult to do so. First,\nas noted above, many or most diseases are defined as disabilities by\ndisability discrimination laws or their judicial and administrative\ninterpretations; they are subject to the same legal protections and\nrequirements of reasonable accommodation as \u201cAmundsonian\u201d\ndisabilities. This legal treatment may, however, be justifiable,\nbecause some diseases, such as AIDS, are stigmatized as severely as\nmany or most disabilities. Second, many disabilities, such as the\ninability to walk, may be associated with diseases, such as MS, which\nhave a progressive character, causing pain and further impairment, and\nsometimes increasing the risk of death (Wendell 2001).[5]\n Third, a society such as our own, where atypical functionings are\noften not well accommodated, accords a higher priority to the\nprevention or treatment of some non-fatal diseases than would a\nsociety that better accommodated them.\n2.2 The Second Approach: Health as More or Other than the Absence of Disease\n\nAn alternative approach to the relationship between health and\ndisability involves a broad or positive conception of health as more\nthan, or distinct from, the absence of disease or disability.\nThis approach has more and less instrumental versions. The former is\nrepresented by Nordenfelt\u2019s account of health as the ability of\nan individual to reach her \u201cvital goals\u201d\u2014those whose\nachievement is independently necessary and jointly sufficient for\nminimal happiness (Nordenfeldt 1995). On such an instrumental account,\nthe relationship of disability to health depends on the goals that are\nconsidered vital or central and on the role of typical functions in\nachieving them. Some impairments will hinder the pursuit of some goals\n(goal-based accounts of health vary in whether or how they specify the\nrelevant environment(s) affecting their pursuit), other impairments\nwill have no effect, and some will enhance the pursuit of\nsome goals. Any generalizations about the impact of impairments on\nhealth will depend on the assessment of their net effect on the\npursuit of the specified goals.\n\nThe breadth of an instrumental approach is apparent in Sridhar\nVenkatapuram\u2019s variation on Nordenfeldt, which replaces the\nlatter\u2019s mix of universal and personal \u201cvital goals\u201d\nwith the \u201cbasic capabilities for minimal happiness\u201d, as\nenumerated by Martha Nussbaum. \u201cWhat is important\u201d,\nVenkatapuram maintains, is \u201cthe idea of health as the capability\nto achieve a cluster of basic capabilities and functionings\u201d\n(277). Far from denying\nthat this conception resembles the much-ridiculed 1948 WHO definition\nof health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental, and social\nwell-being\u201d, Venkatapuram just alters that definition to refer\nto a capability for minimal well-being. Nor does he\nshirk from the practical implications of this conception: \n\n\n\u201cHealth policy and expertise will have to encompass all the\ndeterminants of the core human capabilities that constitute a\nminimally decent life\u201d (278). \n\n\nAt the same time, he recognizes a narrower conception of health,\ntreating it as one of the more specific capabilities that health in\nhis broader conception encompasses. Health in this narrow sense is\njust the capacity to avoid disease and impairment. But it is unclear\nwhy even health in this narrow sense should be a constituent of\nwell-being, given the fact of human mortality and vulnerability. \n\nLawrence Becker has proposed a broad but less instrumental conception\nof health, examining positive conceptions of health in other\ndisciplines, specifically models of positive mental health in\npsychology, which incorporate notions such as resilience, robustness,\ndevelopmental maturity, character strength, and subjective well-being\n(Becker 2005). Such conceptions go beyond the absence of disease in\ntwo ways: they are positive, requiring psychophysical\nvitality\u2014robustness, vigor, and resilience\u2014and they are\nbroad, concerned not merely with biomedical functioning but with more\ncomprehensive well-being.\n\nMore recently, Becker (2012) argues for \u201cbasic good\nhealth\u201d as the metric for \u201cbasic justice\u201d. For\nBecker, basic good health is defined in interactive terms, as\n\u201creliably competent physical and psychological functioning in a\ngiven environment\u201d (2012: 45). As David Crocker (2013) observes,\nthis notion \n\n\nhas both negative and positive elements. The negative dimension\nincludes absence of disease, illness, disability, and other\nimpairments. The positive aspect is \u2026 \u201drobustly active\nagency. To be healthy is to have a kind of agency appropriate to the\nstages on life\u2019s way\u2014from infancy to mature adulthood to\nold age. \n\n\nThis positive aspect of basic good health, if not the notion as a\nwhole, gives support and structure to the claim that one can be\ndisabled but healthy. It could also promote the development of health\ninterventions for people with disabilities that are not directed at\nthe normalization of their atypical or impaired functions. One\nchallenge for this approach is to limit the scope of positive health,\nso that it does not encompass all aspects of well-being, but remains\nanchored in biomedical functioning. A second challenge for this\napproach is to explain how cognitive and affective conditions bear on\nhealth, and how any adverse effects of such conditions can be\nmitigated or eliminated without medical normalization.\n3. Personal Relations, Family, and Disability\n\nAlthough the connection between disability and interpersonal\nrelationships is a topic worth exploring in its own right, it also has\nimportant implications for well-being and health. Numerous empirical\nstudies across a number of behavioral science and medical disciplines\nhave shown the importance of close interpersonal relationships for\nhealth and well-being (Cohen, Gottlieb, and Underwood 2001; Uchino,\nCacioppo and Kiecolt-Glaser 1996; Cohen and Wills 1985). For example,\nmore than 130 empirical studies have shown that on a number of\nwell-being indices, married men and women are generally happier and\nless stressed than unmarried people (Coombs 1991). Personal\nrelationships, including love and friendship, are for most people an\nessential ingredient of the life they want for themselves, something\nto value for their own sake as well as for the support they provide\nduring stressful times. However, many people see disability as an\nobstacle to friendship, romantic love, and rewarding family life.\nDisability scholars and activists reject this widespread belief,\narguing that the obstacles that exist to accessing such relationships\nare due primarily to features of the social and physical\nenvironment.\n\nIn this section, we discuss the perceived barriers to such\nrelationships. Clearly, one\u2019s view about the effect of\ndisability on interpersonal relationships depends on one\u2019s\nconception of disability and on one\u2019s conception of the relevant\ninterpersonal relationships, such as friendship and love. As is\nevident from the discussions in the \u201cFriendship\u201d and\n\u201cLove\u201d entries in this encyclopedia, there is lively\ndebate among philosophers concerning the nature and value of love and\nfriendship.\n3.1 The Nature of Personal Relationships\n\nThe term \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d encompasses relationships\nof widely varying sorts. We will focus on relationships typically\nunderstood as enduring and in some way intimate: between parents and\nchildren, siblings, friends, and committed partners. In that respect,\nour conception of personal relationships is narrower than the broad\nconception of a relationship that figures in some of the literature on\nrelational egalitarian theories of justice (see, for example, Anderson\n2010; though for a principle of relational egalitarianism that is\nderived from consideration of what spouses owe one another, see\nScheffler 2014). The close relationships we have in mind\u2014whether\nof friendship, partnership, or family\u2014involve some degree of\nmutual regard, personal disclosure, and particularized knowledge. They\nalso involve material and emotional mutuality, but need not involve\nequal exchanges between the parties. \n\nPhilosophers have often treated equality of some kind as a\nprerequisite of friendship (see\n SEP entry on friendship).\n In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle distinguished among\nthree kinds of friendship: friendships of pleasure, of utility, and of\nvirtue. The last, the highest or truest form, required similarity of\ncharacter. Philosophers since Aristotle have rejected some of his\nprerequisites for friendship, such as equality of social or economic\nstatus, but they have shared his view that friendship must be a\nrelationship among equals. The debate has largely focused on the kind\nof equality that is required. Thus, Aristotle denied that parents and\ntheir children could ever be true friends, since the inequality\nbetween them could never be overcome no matter how much the child does\nfor his parents. This position is rejected by English (1979) and\nKristjansson (2006). Generally, contemporary accounts of friendship\nplace less emphasis on equality or similarity of specific traits and\nmore on equality of respect, investment, and commitment. Given the\nvast range of differences among close friends in talents, interests,\nand tangible contributions, it would not seem that disabilities pose\nany general barrier to intimacy. \n\nNevertheless, philosophers and bioethicists have tended to look\nskeptically on the possibility that a person with a disability could\noffer the mutuality and equality required for a satisfying\nrelationship with a nondisabled friend, romantic partner, or family\nmember. Even in those relationships where unequal contributions and\nasymmetric dependence are the norm, as with parents and their\nchildren, a child\u2019s disability has been seen as an obstacle to a\ndesirable and rewarding relationship. The disability is perceived as\ncreating an uncomfortable degree of inequality and dissimilarity;\nparents have difficulty picturing the child growing into a productive\nadult and parent, fulfilling some of the goals people have for\nundertaking childrearing (Ruddick 1998). Additionally, the\nchild\u2019s disability has been viewed as imposing burdens on\nparents that differ from and greatly exceed those posed by raising\nchildren who do not have disabilities (Botkin 1995). Moreover, the\nchild\u2019s disability is presumed to extend the duration of\nparental care (Botkin 1995; Kittay 1999; Lindemann and Nelson 2008).\nSimilarly, when the bioethics literature considers people with\ndisabilities as parents, it is largely to assess whether it will be\nharmful for children to be raised by disabled parents (Coleman 2002;\nRobertson 2004); or whether adult children will have to give up their\nother life projects to care for their newly-disabled parents (Callahan\n1988). \n\nIn this literature, relationships involving disabled people are\nchiefly viewed from the perspective of those without disabilities.\nWhether the topic is end-of-life decision making (Hardwig 2000),\ntreatment decisions for low birth weight, premature or otherwise\ndisabled newborns (Stack 1987), the rehabilitation of persons after\ntraumatic brain injury (Nelson and Frader 2004), or selection for or\nagainst disabling traits in embryos or fetuses (Botkin 1995; Ruddick\n2000; Green 2008), the focus is on how nondisabled people are affected\nby a (potential) relationship with someone who has a disability. What\nis largely missing from these accounts is serious consideration of the\nperspective of the person with a disability; of how her life will be\naffected, for good or ill, by the family or friendship relationships\nin which she is embedded. In addition, little attention is paid to\nrelationships in which all involved parties have disabilities. As\nChappell (1994) has noted, writers assume that it is in the interest\nof people with disabilities to aspire to relationships with\nnondisabled people, even if it is not is the interest of the latter.\nIt seems clear that if the consequences of personal relationships for\nthe flourishing of persons with disabilities were given the same\nweight as the consequences for nondisabled persons, it would encourage\na deeper and fuller appreciation of the goods of personal\nrelationships. \n3.2 Peer Relationships: Friendship and Love\n\nAt the heart of the negative portrayal of disability\u2019s impact on\ninterpersonal relationships is the presumed inequality imposed on the\nrelationship when one participant has a disability but others do not.\nThe type of inequality and its explanation are not always made\nexplicit. Does it result from the (perceived) inability of people with\ndisabilities to participate in activities that are important to some,\nmost, or all friendships? Or does it arise from the (perceived) need\non the part of the person with a disability for technological or human\nassistance to manage typical life tasks? Does it stem from a belief\nthat the person with a disability does not possess the social or\npsychological resources to prove a stimulating and rewarding friend?\n\n\nThe influence of a dichotomous conception of disability, that is, of a\nconception of disability as a personal attribute one either has or\nlacks, is evident even in the way questions about disability and\npersonal relationships are framed. In asking questions like \u201cAre\nrelationships between disabled and nondisabled people necessarily\nunequal?\u201d we tend to assume that disability is a categorical\ncharacteristic: that there is a distinct subset of the population that\nis disabled and everyone else is nondisabled. If, instead, we adopted\nthe human variation model of disability (see\n SEP entry on disability: definitions, models, experience),\n we could reframe such questions. That model conceives of an\nimpairment as an arbitrary range on the continuum of variation for a\nhuman attribute. Moreover, the model sees disability as an interaction\nbetween atypical functioning or embodiment and an unaccommodating\nenvironment. Consequently, it emphasizes that most people are\n\u201cdisabled\u201d in some particular physical or social context,\ninsofar as they have some atypical characteristic which fits poorly in\nthat context. The model also suggests that a disability, like an\nimpairment, ought to be considered as a graduated characteristic: just\nas there are degrees of functioning, there are degrees of fit between\nfunctioning-embodiment and social environment. \n\nOn this view, the question \u201cAre relationships between disabled\nand nondisabled people problematically unequal?\u201d would be better\nreformulated as \n\nIs there a positive correlation between the degree to which the\nparties to a relationship differ in overall level of disability, on\nthe one hand, and the degree of problematic interpersonal inequality,\non the other? \n\nAlthough this is largely an empirical question and cannot be answered\nby philosophical reflection alone, philosophy can clarify the concepts\nthat figure in the question: what is it to have a disability, what\nsorts of equality matter in valuable interpersonal relationships, and\nis there a reason, given what disability is and what sorts of equality\nmatter, to think ex ante that such a correlation would\nexist?\n\nOne reason having or acquiring a physical, intellectual, or emotional\ndisability lessens the chances that relationships will move beyond\nacquaintanceship is that the disability looms so large in the minds of\nthe nondisabled person (and perhaps the disabled person as well) that\nit obscures or eclipses other features on which an intimate\nrelationship can be solidly grounded. Most people do not yet see\ndisability as one among many characteristics with respect to which\nhumans can vary. In this way, one aspect of a person comes to dominate\nthe whole, an aspect of stigmatization that elsewhere we have\ndescribed as \u201csynecdoche\u201d (Asch and Wasserman 2005).\n3.3 Romantic Love and Sexual Intimacy\n\nThese points apply as well to the relationship between disability and\nromantic and sexual intimacy. This aspect of romantic leave can\namplify the concerns of people already skeptical about the ability of\npersons with disabilities to contribute to thriving friendships. Many\nnondisabled people may doubt that people with disabilities can be\nfulfilling partners in any loving adult relationship. Prominent\nexplanations of love, again based in Aristotle, hold that having\nloving relationships promotes self-knowledge, insofar as one\u2019s\nbeloved acts as a kind of mirror, reflecting back one\u2019s\ncharacter (see SEP entries on\n love\n and\n friendship).\n Many nondisabled people may find it hard to imagine seeing their\nreflection in a disabled partner. According to LaFollette (1996),\nlove, at least ideally, brings out the best in the participants. For\nnondisabled people, it may be hard to see past the impairment to\nimagine that a partner with a disability can bring out their best, be\nsimilar enough to understand them, enhance their self-worth, or meet\ntheir deepest needs. \n\nDisability creates a number of challenges to forging intimate physical\nand emotional relationships. People with sensory-motor impairments who\nwere disabled beginning in early life often report that they were\nsocially segregated from other children, either directly because they\nwere tracked into different classes or different schools, or\nindirectly because other students avoided them. Consequently, many\ndisabled children have not been socialized about sex in the way other\nchildren have been: even playground misinformation can play a role in\ndeveloping and affirming a sense of nascent sexual identity in\nable-bodied children, yet disabled children are often excluded from\nthis process. To make matters worse, many disabled children do not\nreceive sex education until a much later age than their able-bodied\npeers (if at all), a reflection of the pervasive stereotype that\ndisabled people are infantile and asexual (Shakespeare 1996). \n\nThese challenges persist into adulthood. When disabled people form\nintimate relationships with other adults, cultural stereotypes and\nprejudices continue to exact a high cost. Disabled people are often\nexpected to be \u201cwith their own kind\u201d, and if they do form\nintimate relationships with unimpaired people, they must confront\npatronizing assumptions about the \u201creal\u201d reasons for the\nrelationship: dependency, pity, etc.. When disabled people form\nintimate relationships with one another, they must overcome\npsychological barriers to intimacy that result from society\u2019s\nviews about what an appropriate partner would be or what acceptable\nsexual activity is. Or they must battle family opposition to being\nwith a partner whose similar or different disability prevents that\npartner from assuming the role of \u201ccaregiver\u201d or personal\nassistant. Emens (2009) shows how institutional practices, along with\nphysical and communication barriers, perpetuate and reinforce\nprevailing views that people with disabilities will be incapable of\nparticipating in sexual and partner relationships. \n\nFor various reasons, people with intellectual disabilities have been\nthought incapable of understanding and appreciating the value of\nromantic, sexual, or partner relationships. But as first-person\nnarratives attest, disabled people have grown quite adept at\nnavigating and even overcoming these challenges (Shakespeare 1996).\nNarratives and research demonstrate that even people with\ndevelopmental disabilities or dementia can and often do consent to\nmutual, sustained sexual relations (Kaeser 1992). This is not to deny,\nobviously, that some disabled people lack the cognitive abilities\nnecessary to genuinely consent to sex.\n3.4 Parenting and Disability\n\nThe assumption that people with disabilities will not be able to enter\ninto intimate relationships, or will impose onerous burdens on their\nintimates, may play a significant role in the routinization of\nprenatal testing and abortion for disability. The reluctance of many\nparents to have a disabled child often rests on an exaggerated view of\nthe physical and emotional demands of raising such children, or on a\nfailure to appreciate the capacities of such children to form\nrewarding parent-child relationships. The latter is likely to play a\nmajor role in the strength of the desire to avoid having a child with\na serious cognitive impairment. Indeed, surveys show that prospective\nparents are far more reluctant to have a child with a cognitive or\naffective impairment than a sensory or motor impairment (Wertz 1998).\n\n This reluctance may also rest to a great extent on the\noverwhelming salience of the impairment in a setting where little else\ncan be known about the future child. That salience reinforces the\nalready-powerful tendency to see only the stigmatized trait. Botkin\nmay express the dominant view among prospective parents in arguing\nthat the burden of raising a child with a disability should be treated\nas equivalent to the burden of raising an unwanted child (Botkin 1995:\n32\u201339).  Ferguson argues that the findings from research and\nfrom parent narratives in the past thirty years contradict such\nassertions and demonstrate that families with a child who has a\ndisability look much like other families in terms of satisfaction,\nstress, and system functioning (Ferguson 2001: 373\u201395). Other\nresearch suggests that raising children with severe cognitive and\nother disabilities has greater stresses but similar rewards\n(Aschbrenner, et al. 2010; Blacher and Baker 2007; Gerstein et\nal. 2009).\n\nProspective parents with disabilities are less likely to be encumbered\nby these stereotypes about disabled children, but they may believe\nthat their disabilities have been sufficiently difficult for them that\nthey do not want to pass them on to their children. Moreover, even if\ntheir impairment is not genetic and they are likely to become the\nbiological parent of a child without a disability, they must struggle\nwith deeply-rooted skepticism about their own ability to parent\ndisabled or nondisabled children. If one of the most pervasive\nassumptions about disability is its association with a need for help\nor \u201ccare\u201d from others, the person with a disability may\nthink herself incapable of doing so for others.\n\nThe prospect of parenting by people with disabilities provides an\nopportunity to consider the question of which components of customary\nparent-child relationships are essential to good parenting (Blustein\n1982; Ruddick 1998; O\u2019Neill 2002). Parents with disabilities,\nparticularly cognitive disabilities, are often regarded as unfit to\nmeet the \u201cspecial needs\u201d of disabled children, and\nincapable of serving as mentors and role models for nondisabled\nchildren. Although some judicial decisions, empirical reports, and\npersonal narratives recognize that many people with physical, sensory,\naffective, and cognitive impairments can effectively raise children\nalone or with some assistance, daily life, social service agencies,\nand attitudes of professionals and the public still thwart people with\ndisabilities in their parenting goals (Collings and Llewellyn\n2012; Picciuto 2015). However, social attitudes\nare gradually changing as examples of successful parenting by people\nwith disabilities proliferate (Mutcherson 2008).\n3.5 Personal relationships and third-party assistance\n\nDisability theorists and activists reject the assumption that\ndisabilities pose unique difficulties for personal relationships on\nthe grounds that this assumption reflects an overly narrow view of the\nmutuality required in an intimate relationship. That said, not all\npersons with and without disabilities have the same views about\npossibility of combining intimacy with disability-specific personal\nassistance. To accommodate these differences, some theorists and\nactivists have argued for options that separate instrumental\nassistance from close relationships. These options involve providing\nby paid staff for personal assistance in cases where this helps to\npreserve the mutuality, sharing, and interdependence of friendships,\npartner relations, and family life (Litvak et al. 1987; Asch 1993;\nRatzka 2004). There is much to be said in favor of making third-party\nassistance available. The lack of education and training of family\nmembers in meeting a person\u2019s disability-related needs, the\nsocietal treatment of these needs as different from and more shameful\nthan other needs, and the scarcity and inaccessibility of other\nsupportive services for meeting these needs, can indeed place enormous\nstrain on intimate relationships between nondisabled and disabled\npersons. Further, the constant reliance upon intimates for assistance\nwith travel, communication, or preparation for work or school may\nthwart the desires of persons with disabilities to select what they\nwear, when they come and go, or with whom they associate in their free\ntime. The idea of an entitlement to state-subsidized personal\nassistance has been developed on a policy level by Litvak, Heumann,\nand Zukas (1987), Adolf Ratzka (2004), and Americans Disabled For\nAttendant Programs Today (ADAPT). \n\nIt might be thought that the argument for state-subsidized personal\nassistance undermines the claim that disability does not pose any\ngeneral barriers to intimacy. Those arguing that the state should\nsubsidize personal assistance for people with disabilities might seem\nto share the assumption of Callahan (1988) and Wertz and Fletcher\n(1993) that disability-related needs differ in kind as well as in\ndegree from other material and emotional needs for which\nstate-subsidized assistance is not defended.\n\nDisability advocates would reject this conclusion for at least two\nreasons. First, it is the stigmatization of disability-related needs,\nmore than the actual cost of meeting them, which serves as a barrier\nto intimacy. The stigmatization of disability-related needs creates an\naversion to meeting those needs and a tendency to exaggerate the costs\nof doing so. There is an inclination to see meeting those needs as\nfalling outside the scope of an intimate relationship, when meeting\nrelevantly similar needs of a nondisabled relative are seen as part\nand parcel of intimate relating. By subsidizing personal assistance,\nthe state helps to overcome the exclusionary effects of deeply\nentrenched social attitudes that pose a barrier to intimacy. If these\nattitudes change so that the dominant culture does not find it\nshameful to have disability-specific needs and distasteful to meet\nthem, there might well be less need for personal assistance programs.\nThe remaining need for personal assistance would not sharply\ndistinguish persons with disabilities from friends and intimates who\nalso call upon each other for various forms of assistance.\n\nSecond, the fact that some people with disabilities require more\nassistance than most nondisabled people to achieve their life goals\ndoes not mean that disabilities must pose a barrier to intimacy.\nIntimate relationships often impose special demands on participants\nunrelated to disability. An individual with expensive projects or\ncommitments may cost significantly more to befriend or marry, but\nunless those projects and commitments are extravagant or\nall-consuming, we would not see them as a general barrier to intimacy.\nLikewise, even in an Internet age, it may be more costly to maintain\nfriendships with people who live in remote areas. Yet we tend to see\nthose costs as incidental to the relationships we form, even if they\nlimit them in ways we may regret (Amundson 2005).\n\nA state-subsidized personal assistance response to disability-related\nneeds is not welcomed by all disability theorists and activists.\nWendell (1989, 1996) sees people with disabilities, in their\ndependence, as having lessons to teach nondisabled people about human\ninterdependence. Similarly, Eva Kittay has argued for the importance\nof kinship caregiving. Kittay stresses the importance of a loving and\n\u201csustaining\u201d relationship between the caregiver and the\ncare-recipient, which may be absent when care is professionally\noutsourced. Moreover, family caregivers are more likely to maintain\ntrusting and long-lasting relationships, as opposed to professional\ncaregivers, who may come and go. Furthermore, Kittay stresses the\nsignificance of including disabled people in familial and cultural\nactivities rather than relegating them to paid caregivers, although it\nis not clear why having a paid assistant is inimical to participating\nin familial and communal activities (Kittay 2003). (See also Longmore\n1995 and Levine 2004.).\n\nThese arguments about the value of kinship caregiving do not undermine\nthe case for making professional caregiving relationships a dignified\nand economically viable option. There are many families ill-equipped\nor poorly disposed to adopt that option. But there are also many\ncircumstances in which the differentiation of personal assistant from\nparent, spouse, or friend will give the person with a disability the\nfreedom and privacy that nondisabled people take for granted. In\ncircumstances where kinship assistance would strain rather than\nenhance intimate relationships between family members, it seems clear\nthat third-party assistance should at least be made available as an\noption, even if it is not encouraged across-the-board. \n\nSubsidizing third-party assistance is a means by which the state can\nhelp to create the conditions for the flourishing of positive\nrelationships. The provision of paid third-party assistance is not\nintended to force the separation of instrumental help from close\nrelationships, but to give friends and family members the freedom to\ndecide how much of such assistance they want to incorporate into their\nrelationships. Friends and family members may be entirely comfortable\nmeeting someone\u2019s disability-specific needs, just as they are\nprepared to meet other needs of the people with whom they have\nintimate relationships (Asch 1993). In other cases, and with respect\nto other needs, they may not. Close relationships are not all of a\npiece, and persons with disabilities, their friends, family members,\nand lovers should be able to determine for themselves what kind of\nrelationship they will have and what role there is in it for\nthird-party assistance.\n4. Conclusion\n\nHaving separately discussed well-being, health, and personal\nrelationship, the Entry concludes by considering the links among these\nthree domains, as they pertain to disability.\n\nOn most plausible accounts of well-being, health and personal\nrelationships are either instrumentally conducive to well-being or\npartially constitutive of it. An account of well-being which entailed\nthat health and personal relationships were not important means to or\nconstituents of well-being would be prima facie implausible.\nConsequently, an account of health entailing that persons with\ndisabilities are necessarily unhealthy, or an account of personal\nrelationships entailing that persons with disabilities cannot enjoy\nmany of the goods of those relationships, will also have the\nimplication that persons with disabilities cannot attain the same\nlevel of well-being as able-bodied persons absent\ncompensating capacities or achievements in other domains.\n\nMany laypersons, policymakers, and philosophers implicitly or\nexplicitly adopt theories of health and personal relationships with\nthis implication. But there are plausible accounts of health and\npersonal relationships which do not entail that disability is inimical\nto well-being. And on most plausible accounts of well-being,\ndisability need not present a formidable barrier to living a good\nlife. This is so on appropriately pluralistic, flexible and\nbroadly-framed objective-list accounts as well as on subjective\naccounts. A blind or deaf person cannot exercise all five senses. But\nthere are plausible arguments for the conclusion that they can have\nlives with rich aesthetic experience, pleasure, and joy.\n\nWe suggest that the difficulty in appreciating that people with\ndisabilities may have lives as good as those of people without\ndisabilities, objectively as well as subjectively, may arise in part\nfrom a failure of imagination by nondisabled people. A body of\nempirical research indicates that people without disabilities rate the\nsubjective well-being of people with disabilities far lower than they\nrate it themselves. (Albrecht and Devlieger 1999; Gill 2000; Goering\n2008). If all persons enjoy a defeasible presumption of epistemic\nauthority with respect to the quality of their experiences, this\ndivergence suggests that the widely shared assumption that\ndisabilities reduce quality of life should be regarded as\ncontroversial, not self-evident. Although we have no empirical\nresearch to support us, we suspect the same is true for the divergent\nassessments of the prospects for objective well-being of people with\ndisabilities. Non-disabled people may have greater difficulty\nimagining how people with disabilities can enjoy or develop the\ncapabilities for the various constituents of objective well-being,\nparticularly those concerning health and personal relationships.\n\nThis highlights a broader point connecting all three domains, as well\nas the relationship between philosophy and disability more generally.\nMost philosophical discussions of disability have implicitly assumed\nthe perspective of persons who do not have a disability. They have\nasked whether other people, the people with disabilities,\nhave lower levels of well-being; whether other people, the people with\ndisabilities, are less healthy; whether other people, the people with\ndisabilities, will pose a comparatively higher burden as friends or\nintimates. In much recent work in political philosophy, disability has\nfigured most prominently as a paradigm example of bad luck, and the\nquestion is whether and to what extent we the able-bodied should\ncompensate disabled others for their misfortune (see\n SEP entry on disability and justice).\n By implicitly adopting the perspective of nondisabled persons, from\nwhich persons with disabilities appear only in the third-person, much\nmainstream work in philosophy has failed to take seriously the\nperspectives of persons with disabilities\u2014even when those\nperspectives are directly relevant to the conceptual question under\ndiscussion: what is the nature of well-being, or friendship, or\nhealth? We hope that this entry can be a point of departure for a\ndiscussion of these concepts that takes into account a wider range of\nrelevant considered judgments, intuitions, and perspectives.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["ADAPT (American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today), \u201cA\nDisability Perspective on Home Health Care\u201d,\n <a href=\"http://www.adapt.org/older/homehealth\" target=\"other\">available online</a>,\n Albertson, NY: National Center on Employment of the\nHandicapped, Human Resources Center, accessed August 22, 2014.", "Albrecht, G.L. and G.
