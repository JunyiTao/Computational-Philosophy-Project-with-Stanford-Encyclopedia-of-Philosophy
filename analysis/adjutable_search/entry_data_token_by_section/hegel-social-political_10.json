    "main_text": "Family\n7. Family\n\nHegel begins his discussion of the first emergence of right embodied\nin the world through the sphere of Family. As we should expect, Hegel\nuses common terminology in uncommon ways again.\n\nIn Abstract Right, separate abstract individuals connect together\nthrough mutual recognition by acknowledging the ownership of property.\nIn Ethical Life, the Family is a sphere where concrete individuals come\ntogether bound in a love for each other (PR \u00a7158). This\nconnection is not purely arbitrary, like animals seeking only to\nsatisfy their needs and then seek another. For Hegel, the Family is a\nconnection that, at least in principle, aims at a permanence he calls\n\u201cmarriage\u201d (PR \u00a7161).\n\nThese marriages are not defined in contractual terms, but ethical. A\ncontract is an agreement that different parties can enter or exit on\nmutual consent. Any shared commitment or unity has a temporary\ncharacter. This is little better than the kind of mutual recognition we\nsaw in Abstract Right.\n\nHowever, in marriage, a more substantive unity is created that is a\npermanent bond unlike most contracts. This does not mean that Hegel\nforbids divorce. The termination of a marriage is seen as an\nunfortunate possibility born from marriage\u2019s foundation in our\nfeelings, like love, which can be unstable over time (PR\n\u00a7163 Addition).\n\nWhile divorce is permitted, arranged marriages are not (PR\n\u00a7162). This is because marriage is a further development of our\nfreedom \u2013 and it requires our being able to choose a life\npartner. In this way, marriage is an advance of our mutual recognition\nfrom a contract where we agree ownership of some thing to where we\nchoose to create a unity with another longer term.\n\nFor Hegel, the Family achieves unity through its creation of\nchildren (PR \u00a7173 Addition). To this extent, he plainly\nendorses the traditional family model (see Haldane 2006). However, this\nis done on very non-traditional grounds. What guides\nHegel\u2019s thinking is his logic which brings together opposites in\na creative unity producing some new, higher concept (PR\n\u00a7165). Likewise, Hegel saw men and women as embodying different\nfeatures with their sexual union able to create children, not unlike\nthe universal and particular giving birth to the concrete individual\n(PR \u00a7165).\n\nThese views have rightly been subjected to widespread criticism by\nfeminists and others (Halper 2001, Knowles 2002, Ravven\n1988, Stone 2002). A common argument is that Hegel\u2019s\njustification of the Family is a poor defence of privileging men over\nwomen on the basis of his controversial dialectical method. Only men\nhave the opportunity to engage outside the home in civil society and\nfully participate in the state. These critics claim that such a\nprivilege should not be reserved for men alone for many, often obvious,\nreasons. It is also argued that his broad views about the essence of\nmarriage as a permanent bond built on love can be achieved by\nnon-traditional families, too. It is worth pointing out that\nHegel\u2019s talk of the Family is of an ideal. Hegel fathered a child\noutside of wedlock who he supported throughout his life. He sees\nhimself as revealing the full development of right wherever it may take\nus, and what it requires from us or our institutions may be different\nfrom how we find them.\n",
