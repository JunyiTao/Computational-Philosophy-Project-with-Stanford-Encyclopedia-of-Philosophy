    "main_text": "Related Issues || Solipsism?\n2.6 Solipsism?\n\nPrima facie, RQM may seem to imply a form of perspective solipsism, as\nthe values of variables realized in the perspective of some system\n\\(S'\\) are not necessarily the same as those realized with respect to\nanother system \\(S''\\). This is however not the case, as follows\ndirectly from quantum theory itself. The key is to observe that any\nphysical comparison is itself a quantum interaction. Suppose the\nvariable \\(A\\) of \\(S\\) is measured by \\(S'\\) and stored into the\nvariable \\(A'\\) of \\(S'\\). This means that the interaction has created\na correlation between \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\). In turn, this means that a\nthird system measuring \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) will certainly find consistent\nvalues. That is: the perspectives of \\(S'\\) and \\(S''\\) agree on this\nregard, and this can be checked in a physical interaction.\n\nFor instance: imagine experimenter \\(S'\\) measures the spin of the\nelectron \\(S\\), and writes the value of this spin on a piece of paper.\nIn principle, experimenter \\(S''\\) can devise an experiment where she\ncan detect an effect due to interference between the two branches\nwhere the spin of the electron (and the text) have one or the other\nvalue. But if \\(S''\\) measures the spin and reads the piece of paper,\nshe will find that experimenter \\(S'\\) has seen the same spin as\nherself.\n\nWhy? Because quantum theory predicts so, as can be seen from the\nfollowing: with respect to \\(S''\\), the first interaction yields a\nquantum state of the form \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} & \\ket{\\text{spin up}} \\times \\ket{\\text{paper\nwith text } \\lsq\\text{spin up}\\rsq} \\\\ & + \n\\ket{\\text{spin down}} \\times\n\\ket{\\text{paper with text } \\lsq\\text{spin down}\\rsq} \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nMeasuring the spin projects the state on one single branch of the two,\nand both branches lead to consistency. Therefore, as long as we do not\nchase subtle interference phenomena hidden behind decoherence, RQM\nimplies that we all \u2018see the same world\u2019.\n",
