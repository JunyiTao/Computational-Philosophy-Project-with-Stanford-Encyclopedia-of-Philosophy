    "main_text": "\n\nAutonomy is usually understood by feminist writers in the same way\nthat it is understood within moral psychology generally, namely, as\nself-government or self-direction: being autonomous is acting on\nmotives, reasons, or values that are one\u2019s own. Early\nfeminist literature regarded the notion of autonomy with suspicion\nbecause it was thought to promote unattractive\n\u201cmasculinist\u201d ideals of personhood; that is, it was\nthought to presuppose a conception of the person as\n\u201catomistic\u201d, as ideally self-sufficient, as operating in a\nvacuum unaffected by social relationships, or as an abstract reasoner\nstripped of distorting influences such as emotions. Recently feminists\nhave sought to rehabilitate the notion of autonomy. Some have argued\nthat articulating the conditions of autonomous choice is essential to\nunderstanding gender oppression and related concepts such as\nobjectification. The challenge facing feminist theorists therefore is\nto reconceptualize autonomy from a feminist perspective. The term\n\u201crelational autonomy\u201d is often used to refer to feminist\nreconceptualizations of autonomy to contrast them with notions of\nautonomy that are thought to presuppose atomistic conceptions of the\nself.\n",
