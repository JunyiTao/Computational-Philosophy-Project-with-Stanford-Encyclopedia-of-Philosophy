New Directions in Feminist Political Philosophy\n\nAs a recent review writes,\n\n\nFeminist theory today is a sprawling, productive, diverse intellectual\nand political assemblage. It grows through imaginative\ninterdisciplinary work and critical political engagements. Feminist\ntheory is not only about women, although it is that; it is about the\nworld, engaged through critical intersectional perspectives. (K.\nFerguson 2017)\n\n\nNew work in feminist political philosophy continues to transform\npolitical philosophy, including ancient debates over identity versus\ndifference, the private and the public, certainty and freedom. For\nexample, new readings of Arendt\u2019s philosophy offer hope of\nmoving beyond the associational/agonistic divide in democratic\nfeminist theory (Barker et al. [eds] 2012). Benhabib\u2019s\nproceduralism is being surpassed with more affect-laden accounts of\ndeliberation (Krause 2008; Howard 2017). Instead of the rational\nback-and-forth of reasoned argumentation, theorists are beginning to\nsee deliberative talk as forms of constituting the subject, judging\nwithout pre-conceived truths, and performatively creating new\npolitical projects (Zerilli 2005 and 2016).\n\nSome of the most generative sites for feminist political theorizing\ntoday are the global threats that face all of us, for instance\nenvironmental degradation or the rise of authoritarianism. In\necofeminist perspectives, as the entry on\n feminist environmental philosophy\n explains, the domination and destruction of \u201cnature\u201d has\nlong been recognized as a feminist issue of political significance\n(especially due to the deep associations between femininity and nature\nthat run through Western patriarchal philosophy and culture). More\nrecently, ecofeminists have extended theories of democracy, agency,\nand rights to include elements of the natural world (Nussbaum 2022).\nMeanwhile, with the rise of authoritarianism in governments across the\nglobe in the second decade of the twenty-first century, feminist\npolitical philosophers have tried to understand the roots of recent\nthreats to democracy (Fraser 2019; McAfee 2019; Nussbaum 2018).\n\nIn sum, feminist political philosophy is a still evolving field of\nthought that has much to offer mainstream political philosophy. In the\npast two decades it has come to exert a stronger influence over\nmainstream political theorizing, raising objections that mainstream\nphilosophers have had to address, though not always very convincingly.\nAnd in its newest developments it promises to go even further.\n",
