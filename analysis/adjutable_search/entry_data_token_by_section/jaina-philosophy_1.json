    "main_text": "Ethics of renunciation: from self-sacrifice to non-violence and omniscience || Non-violence as a characteristic mark of Jainism\n1.2 Non-violence as a characteristic mark of Jainism\n\nA peculiarity of Jainism is to essentially associate these\nrenunciatory liberating practices with the imperative of non-violence\n(ahi\u1e43s\u0101) (Donaldson & Baj\u017eelj 2021). More\nprecisely, at the heart of Jainism is the belief according to which\neach living being is the transitory embodiment of a permanent\ndivine-like self (j\u012bva), which is unobstructed\nconsciousness. In this conception, a human being can clear her self\nfrom all the obstructions she currently experiences until she becomes\nthe unobstructed consciousness she essentially is. Now, this\nconception also implies the non-harming (ahi\u1e43s\u0101)\nof the other divine-like selves which, in turns, implies a constant\nawareness of their presence and true nature, as well as self-mastery\nand careful behavior. In one of the most ancient Jaina texts, the\nCanonical Text on Behavior\n(\u0100c\u0101r\u0101\u1e45gas\u016btra, \u0100S), written\nin early Ardham\u0101gadh\u012b around the\n4th\u20133rd centuries BCE, practices conducive\nto liberation are presented in the following way:\n\n\n\u0100S 1.1.21. For the sake of survival, for the sake of praise,\nhonor, reverence, for the sake of birth, death, liberation, for the\nsake of prevention of miseries\u2026\n\u0100S 1.1.22. \u2026some monk either indulges himself in\naction causing violence to the beings or earth-body through various\nkinds of weapons, makes others to cause violence to the beings of\nearth-body, or approve of others causing violence to the beings of\nearth-body.\n\u0100S 1.1.23. Such an act of violence proves baneful for him.\nSuch an act of violence deprives him of enlightenment.\n\u0100S 1.1.24. He (the true ascetic), comprehending it, becomes\nvigilant over the practice of self-discipline.\n\u0100S 1.1.25. Hearing from the Venerable Mah\u0101v\u012bra\nhimself or from the monks, one comes to know: it (i.e., causing\nviolence to the beings of earth-body), in fact, is the knot of\nbondage; it, in fact, is the delusion; it, in fact, is the death; it,\nin fact, is the hell.\n\n\n\nConcretely, to get closer to the realization of our real nature\nconsists of being aware of the presence of other selves in living\nbeings around oneself and of acting in a non-harming way towards them.\nThis gave rise to practices of renunciation:\n\npractices of non-violence, such as not eating meat, not drinking\nnon-filtered water containing microscopic forms of life, or walking\nwith extreme caution and restrictions;\npractices towards self-control, like meditation or mortification\nof the flesh;\npractices of abstinence, in the line of no sexual intercourse, no\nfood for given periods of time, non-possession up to the nudity of\nsome monks; and\npenances, today mainly consisting in fasts and recitation of\nprayers.\n\n\nOne can only notice the strict character of these norms of action.\nJaina thinkers have developed thorough classifications as a backdrop\nof these norms (Balbir 1999). First, classifications on the types of\nviolence to be avoided, that include not only direct harmful acts, but\nalso delegated ones, as well as the bare fact of permitting a harmful\nact by letting it happen. Besides, acts can be physical, verbal or\nmental ones. This forms the ground of a moral theory in which our\nresponsibility extends far beyond commonly shared conceptions.\n\nNext to this, living beings are classified, from one-sensed beings,\nlike earth-beings, water beings or plants, to five-senses beings, like\nhumans, mammals, or gods. In this classification, only human beings\ncan get liberated. So even if gods have more felicity than human\nbeings, this is not the ultimately desired state. With such a\nconception, Jainism propounds a type of reasoned anthropocentrism,\ninasmuch as there is a unicity and rarity of the human life, without\nit being central. Besides, one should avoid to harm even the\nmicroscopic life forms present in the soil. This version of\nnon-violence is so extreme that one\u2019s restrained action is very\nclose to one\u2019s mere absence of act, since even breathing,\ndrinking water, or walking can prove harmful.\n\nOn a methodological level, one can also only notice the thorough use\nof lists in this philosophical paradigm, the more striking example is\nprobably to be found in the Canonical text on possibilities\n(Sth\u0101n\u0101\u1e45gas\u016btra,\n3rd\u20132nd centuries BCE\n[\u1e6ch\u0101\u1e47.]), in which philosophical considerations take\nthe form of ordered lists of items, starting with singletons in\nchapter one (e.g., one Mah\u0101v\u012bra in this cosmic cycle),\ncontinuing with lists of two items in chapter two (e.g., the self\nversus non-self stuff), and so on up to the tenth chapter,\nthat presents lists of ten items (e.g., there are ten characteristics\nof the Jaina path, namely patience, liberation, honesty, kindness,\nhumbleness, truth, self-discipline, austerity, detachment and\nchastity).\n\nThe difficulty of following these norms of action gave rise to two\nimportant changes in Jaina conceptions of the world (Johnson 1995).\nFirst, in early canons, violent acts are the only direct factors of\nbondage; while in later canonical texts, passions came to play an\nimportant role, which means that one\u2019s intention to harm is\nvalued in the calculus of one\u2019s bondage. In this dynamic,\nnon-intentional harmful act can be forgiven. Second, the difficulty to\nfollow these norms is one of the fields in which the many-sided\nperspectival stance of Jaina philosophers emerged, since an action can\nbe qualified as harmful from a given perspective, while qualified as\nnon-harmful\u2014therefore permitted\u2014from another\nperspective.\n\nNow, next to be able to determine whether an act is harmful or not is\nthe question to determine what is a self and what is not.\n",
