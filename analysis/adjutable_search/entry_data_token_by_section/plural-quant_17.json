    "main_text": "Ontological Innocence? || The incorrect predication argument\n5.2 The incorrect predication argument\n\nThe second argument is nicely encapsulated by Boolos\u2019s remark\nthat \u201cIt is haywire to think that when you have some Cheerios,\nyou are eating a set\u201d (1984: 448\u20139 [1998a: 72]).\nWhat Boolos is suggesting here is that analyses which deny Ontological\nInnocence are likely to get the subject of plural predications\nwrong.\n\nThe obvious response is to interpret plural predicates in a way which\nensures that what we eat are the elements of a set and not\nthe set itself. Consider the sentence:\n\n(18)\n George Boolos ate some Cheerios for breakfast on January 1,\n1985.\n\n\nWhen the direct object of the verb \u201cate\u201d is plural, we can\nfor instance interpret the verb by means of the relation x\nate-the-elements-of y.\n\nIt will be objected that this response makes the verb\n\u201cate\u201d ambiguous in an implausible way (Oliver and Smiley\n2001). For when the verb has a direct object that is singular, it will\npresumably be interpreted by means of the ordinary relation x ate\ny. But there is fairly strong evidence that the verb\n\u201cate\u201d isn\u2019t ambiguous in this way. For instance, one\neffect of an ambiguity is to disallow certain kinds of ellipsis. An\nexample is the ambiguity of \u201cmake\u201d in \u201cmake\nbreakfast\u201d and \u201cmake a plan\u201d, which disallows the\nfollowing ellipsis:\n\n(*19)\n Boolos made breakfast, but his guest, only a plan.\n\n\nSo if \u201cate\u201d was ambiguous in the way just described, the\nfollowing ellipsis would be disallowed as well, which it\nisn\u2019t:\n\n(20)\n Boolos ate some Cheerios, but his guest, only an apple.\n\n\nHowever, it is far from clear that the above response to\nBoolos\u2019s argument needs to be committed to any such problematic\nambiguities. We can for instance let all predicates take\nplural entities as their arguments. The verb \u201cate\u201d will\nthen always receive as its interpretation the relation\nthe-elements-of x ate-the-elements-of y, thus removing any\nambiguity. Whether or not this response is ultimately acceptable, it\nshows that the argument in question remains inconclusive.\n",
