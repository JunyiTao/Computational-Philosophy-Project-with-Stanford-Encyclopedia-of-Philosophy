    "main_text": "Empirical Research || Developmental and Comparative Psychology\n3. Norm Cognition and Morality\n\nNorms are relevant to areas of research across philosophy, the\nhumanities, and the behavioral sciences, and the kinds of\ncognitive-evolutionary accounts of norm psychology described here have\nthe potential to inform and enrich many of them. The most immediate\nimplications would seem to fall within the domain of moral theory.\nHowever, the relationship of norms and norm psychology to morality and\nmoral psychology is not straightforward, and is itself a subject of\ndebate (Machery 2012). The quest to delimit the boundaries of the\nmoral domain, and to distinguish the genuinely moral from non-moral\nnorms, has a long history, but has yet to produce a view that is\nwidely accepted (Stich 2018). For example, some researchers argue that\nthere are proximate psychological differences that can be used to\ndistinguish a set of moral rules from others (conventional rules,\netiquette rules, pragmatic rules). According to one prominent account\nrooted in developmental psychology, moral rules are marked by the fact\nthat individuals judge them to hold generally rather than only\nlocally, and to apply independently of the pronouncement of any\nauthority figure, and to govern matters concerning harm, welfare,\njustice, and rights (Turiel 1983; Nucci 2001). Some have drawn\ninspiration from the sentimentalist tradition in moral theory to build\non this account, explaining the features posited as distinctive of\nmoral rules by appeal to their connection to emotions like anger or\ndisgust (Nichols 2004; cf. Haidt 2001). Others have contested the\ninitial characterization of moral norms, marshalling arguments and\nevidence that it is not psychologically universal, but is rather\nparochial to certain cultures (Kelly et al. 2007; Kelly & Stich\n2007, also see Berni\u016bnas, Dranseika, & Sousa, 2016;\nBerni\u016bnas, Silius, & Dranseika, 2020; cf. Kumar 2015; Heath\n2017).\n\nShifting focus from proximate to ultimate considerations seems to add\nlittle clarity. While some theorists hold that our species possesses\nan evolved psychological system dedicated specifically to morality\n(Joyce 2007; Mameli 2013; Stanford 2018; cf. Kitcher 2011), others\nremain skeptical. They argue instead that the evidence better supports\nthe view that humans have an evolved psychological system dedicated to\nnorms in general, but there is nothing about the mechanisms that\nunderlie it, the adaptive pressures that selected for it, or the norms\nthat it can come to contain that would support a distinction between\nmoral norms and non-moral norms (Machery & Mallon 2010; Davis\n& Kelly 2018; Stich forthcoming). On this view, rather, the human\nnorm system evolved to be able to deal with, and can still acquire and\ninternalize, a wide range of norms, including epistemic norms,\nlinguistic norms, sartorial norms, religious norms, etiquette norms,\nand norms that might be classified by a contemporary westerner as\nmoral. Indeed, the claim has been taken to support a historicist view\nof morality itself, according to which the practice of distinguishing\nsome subset of norms and normative judgments as moral, and thus as\npossessing special status or authority, is a culturally parochial and\nrelatively recent historical invention (Machery 2018).\n\nThat said, several debates with broadly moral subject matter have\nalready begun drawing on empirically inspired accounts of norm\npsychology. For example, philosophical discussions of the moral\nquestions raised by implicit social biases have recently assumed the\nshape of venerable and long-standing debates between individualists\nand structuralists (Beeghly & Holroyd 2020, also see Brownstein\n2015 [2019]). A central issue has been whether behaviors are best\nexplained and injustices best addressed by focusing attention on\nindividual agents and their implicit biases and other psychological\ncharacteristics, on the one hand, or on features of the institutions\nand social structures that those agents inhabit, on the other\n(Haslanger 2015). This has inspired attempts to develop an\ninteractionist account that can combine the virtues of both approaches\n(Madva 2016; Soon 2020).\nSeveral of these have put norms center stage (Ayala-L\u00f3pez\n2018), and drawn on empirical research on norm psychology to show how\nnorms serve as a connective tissue that weaves individuals and soft\nsocial structures together (Davidson & Kelly 2020).\n\nCultural variation in norms and persistent disputes over right and\nwrong have been thought to have significant implications for\nmetaethics as well. The \u201cargument from disagreement\u201d (Loeb\n1998) holds that if dispute over the permissibility of some activity\nor practice persists even after reasoning errors and non-moral factual\ndisagreements have been resolved, such intractable disagreement would\nmilitate against moral realism (Mackie 1977). Empirically establishing\nthe existence of persistent disagreement is difficult (Doris &\nPlakias 2008), but the character of the norm system and its influence\non judgment may speak to whether or not it is likely. Consider two\nindividuals from different cultures, who have internalized divergent\nfamilies of norms (individualistic and collectivist, honor based and\nshame based, divinity and autonomy, tight and loose, etc.) Such\nindividuals are likely to disagree about the permissibility of a range\nof activities and practices, such as what counts as a fair division of\nresources, or whether people should get to choose who they marry, or\nwhat is and is not an appropriate way to respond to an insult. This\ndisagreement may very well endure even in the face of agreement about the\nnon-moral facts of the matter, and even when neither side of the\ndispute is being partial or making any reasoning errors. Such\npersistent disagreement may be explainable by appeal to differences in\nthe individual\u2019s respective norm systems, and to the different\nnorms each has internalized from his or her culture (Machery et al.\n2005). Empirical details of the operational principles of normative\ncognition\u2014especially knowing whether and the extent to which it\nis informationally encapsulated, cognitively impenetrable, or\notherwise recalcitrant and insensitive to other psychological\nprocesses\u2014can help assess the plausibility of this argument.\n\nA final set of debates to which the details of norm psychology are\nbecoming increasingly relevant are those concerning the nature and\nexplanation of moral progress. Recent progress is understood to have\nlargely come in the form of expansions of the moral circle, the spread\nof inclusive norms, and the demoralization of invalid ones (Singer 1981; Buchanan\n& Powell 2018; cf. Sauer 2019.) Much attention has focused on\nunderstanding changes in the distribution of norms that occur as the\nresult of reasoning about norms (Campbell & Kumar 2012), but\nimportant steps towards moral progress may also occur as the result of\nmyopic, though not fully blind, processes of cultural evolution (cf.\nKling 2016; Brownstein & Kelly 2019). A more detailed empirical\nunderstanding of the relationship of internalized norms to\nrationalization, critical reasoning, and explicit argumentation\n(Summers 2017; Mercier & Sperber 2017), along with a clearer view\nof the other psychological and social factors that influence norms and the\ndynamics of their transmission, will help further illuminate these\nimportant philosophical debates.\n",
