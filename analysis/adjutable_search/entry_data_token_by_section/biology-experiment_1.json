    "main_text": "Experimentation and Causal Reasoning || Generalizations of Mill\u2019s Methods\n1.2 Generalizations of Mill\u2019s Methods\n\nMill\u2019s methods can be formalized and generalized into rich and\nsophisticated methodologies of causal reasoning (e.g., Ragin 1987,\nBaumgartner 2009, Gra\u00dfhoff 2011, Beirlaen, Leuridan and Van De\nPutte 2018). Such accounts haven been successfully used in the\nreconstruction of historical episodes such as the discovery of the\nurea cycle (Gra\u00dfhoff, Casties and Nickelsen 2000; Grasshoff and\nMay 1995).\n\nMill\u2019s methods and their generalized versions may even be viewed as\nproviding some kind of a logic of discovery (see also Schaffner 1974),\nthe existence of which has long been controversial (Nickles 1980).\nHowever, it should be noted that the methods of causal reasoning do\nnot generate causal knowledge from scratch, as it were. They already\ntake causal hypotheses as inputs and refine them in an iterative way\n(Grasshoff 2011). While some formulations (including Mill\u2019s own\nmentioned above) may suggest that the inputs to Mill\u2019s methods are\nmere associations or regularities, it should be clear by now that the\nmethod is only reliable if some kind of causal knowledge is already at\nhand. In our example above, the causal assumption is that of causal\nhomogeneity, which obviously has causal content. This vindicates the\nslogan \u201cno causes in, no causes out\u201d (Cartwright 1989, Ch.\n2).\n\nThis discussion has focused on deterministic causal reasoning, which\nis widespread in experimental biology. It should be mentioned that, of\ncourse, there are also statistical inference methods of the kind\nformalized in Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines (2000) in use, in\nparticular regression analysis and analysis of variance, which are\nfrequently used in biological field experiments. Wet lab experiments,\nby contrast, rarely require such techniques.\n\nSome enthusiasts of causal inference methods believe that a\nsophisticated version of Mill\u2019s methods (and their statistical\ncounterparts) are basically all that is needed in order to account for\nexperimental practice (e.g., Gra\u00dfhoff 2011). An attraction of\nthis view is that it can be construed essentially as requiring only\ndeduction and no cumbersome inductive methods.\n",
