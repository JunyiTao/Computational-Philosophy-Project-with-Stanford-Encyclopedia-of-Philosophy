    "main_text": "Statistical Mechanics and the Second Law || Which second law?\n2.2 Which second law?\n\n\nAtomic physics allows the possibility of evolutions to states that\nwould usually be characterised as having a lower thermodynamic\nentropy.  An exorcism of Maxwell's demon, therefore, cannot be taken\nto be the claim that this entropy cannot go down, as this is\ndefinitely possible.  Smoluchowski proposed, not an outright exorcism\nof Maxwell's demon, but an argument that Maxwell's demon could not\nviolate a modified second law. He offered a modified formulation of\nthe second law which states the demon is unable to reliably,\ncontinuously produce work. Such a demon, while not exorcised, might be\nconsidered \u201ctamed\u201d. A tame demon could produce (in the\nterminology of Earman and Norton (1998)) \u201cstraight\u201d\nviolations of the second law, but not \u201cembellished\u201d\nviolations, where the straight violation is exploited in such a way as\nto reliably, continuously produce such work.\n\n\nSuch a formulation leaves much to be clarified: reliability is not\nclearly defined and the requirement that the demon only fail in the\ninfinite time limit seems to allow arbitrarily large violations on any\nfinite time scale we might care about, with probabilities as close to\none as we please, provided they do not actually reach one. A common\nreworking of the modified form, but which is clearly stronger, is that\nthe demon cannot operate a cycle, in finite time, in which the\nexpectation value for work produced is positive, as repetition of such\na cycle could produce arbitrarily large amounts of work with\nprobability arbitrarily close to one.\n\n\nNot only are these formulations inequivalent, they leave open the\npossibility of other types of violation. Is there a demon which\ncontinuously, reliably produces work without ever completing a cycle or\nperhaps a demon which produces arbitrarily large amounts of work and\ncompletes a cycle with a probability arbitrarily close to one, but\nwhich still does not succeed on average as it faces a catastrophically\nlarge failure on the remote possibility that it fails? Whether a cycle\nneeds to complete with certainty, or just with probability arbitrarily\nclose to one, whether a completed cycle means the system must return to\nexactly its initial state or whether it need only return to an\nequivalent state, would seem to require clarification as part of such a\nmodified law.\n\n\nFormulations of modified second laws in terms of entropy must first\nidentify the entropy function being used. Here the problem is not so\nmuch to define a modified law. One may easily define ones that are\nalready known to be true (the fine grained Gibbs entropy cannot\ndecrease) or false (the Boltzmann entropy cannot decrease, or cannot\ndecrease on average). The challenge must be to show that a given\nmodified law is, in fact, the law one should really be concerned about.\nIts violation would show that untamed demons clearly exist, while its\nproof would ensure that all demons are tamed.\n\n\nIn this entry a constrained violation is one in which the\nunmodified second law is violated, but with some constraint upon the\nform of the violation so that some form of modified second law\nmay still be possible. An unconstrained violation is one in\nwhich all attempts to construct meaningful modifications of the second\nlaw are also invalidated. Although this is still ambiguous, there seems\ngeneral agreement that a cycle which could complete in finite time and\nwith probability one, and have no other effect than to convert a\nquantity of heat into work, would certainly constitute an unconstrained\nviolation.\n",
