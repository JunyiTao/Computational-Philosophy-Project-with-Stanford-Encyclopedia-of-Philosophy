    "main_text": "Characterisation of Ontological Arguments\n3. Characterisation of Ontological Arguments\n\nIt is not easy to give a good characterisation of ontological\narguments. The traditional characterisation involves the use of\nproblematic notions\u2014analyticity, necessity, and a\npriority\u2014and also fails to apply to many arguments to which\ndefenders have affixed the label \u201contological\u201d. (Consider,\nfor example, the claim that I conceive of a being than which no\ngreater can be conceived. This claim is clearly not analytic (its\ntruth doesn\u2019t follow immediately from the meanings of the words\nused to express it), nor necessary (I might never have entertained the\nconcept), nor a priori (except perhaps in my own case, though\neven this is unclear\u2014perhaps even I don\u2019t know\nindependently of experience that I have this concept.)) However, it is\nunclear how that traditional characterisation should be improved upon.\n\n\nPerhaps one might resolve to use the label \u201contological\nargument\u201d for any argument which gets classified as \u201can\nontological argument\u201d by its proponent(s). This procedure would\nmake good sense if one thought that there is a natural\nkind\u2014ontological arguments\u2014which our practice carves out,\nbut for which is hard to specify defining conditions. Moreover, this\nprocedure can be adapted as a pro tem stop gap: when there is\na better definition to hand, that definition will be adopted instead.\nOn the other hand, it seems worthwhile to attempt a more informative\ndefinition.\n\nFocus on the case of ontological arguments for the conclusion that God\nexists. One characteristic feature of these arguments is the use which\nthey make of \u201creferential vocabulary\u201d\u2014names,\ndefinite descriptions, indefinite descriptions, quantified noun\nphrases, etc.\u2014whose ontological commitments\u2014for\noccurrences of this vocabulary in \u201creferential\nposition\u201d\u2014non-theists do not accept.\n\nTheists and non-theists alike (can) agree that there is\nspatio-temporal, or causal, or nomic, or modal structure to the world\n(the basis for cosmological arguments); and that there are certain\nkinds of complexity of organisation, structure and function in the\nworld (the basis for teleological arguments); and so on. But theists\nand non-theists are in dispute about whether there are perfect beings,\nor beings than which no greater can be conceived, or \u2026\u00a0;\nthus, theists and non-theists are in dispute about the\nindirect subject matter of the premises of ontological\narguments.\n\nOf course, the premises of ontological arguments often do not deal\ndirectly with perfect beings, beings than which no greater can be\nconceived, etc.; rather, they deal with descriptions of, or ideas of,\nor concepts of, or the possibility of the existence of, these things.\nHowever, the basic point remains: ontological arguments require the\nuse of vocabulary which non-theists should certainly find problematic\nwhen it is used in ontologically committing contexts (i.e not inside\nthe scope of prophylactic operators\u2014such as \u201caccording to\nthe story\u201d or \u201cby the lights of theists\u201d or\n\u201cby the definition\u201d\u2014which can be taken to afford\nprotection against unwanted commitments).\n\nNote that this characterisation does not beg the question against the\npossibility of the construction of a successful ontological\nargument\u2014i.e., it does not lead immediately to the conclusion\nthat all ontological arguments are question-begging (in virtue of the\nontologically committing vocabulary which they employ). For it may be\nthat the vocabulary in question only gets used in premises under the\nprotection of prophylactic operators (which ward off the unwanted\ncommitments.) Of course, there will then be questions about whether\nthe resulting arguments can possibly be valid\u2014how could the\ncommitments turn up in the conclusion if they are not there in the\npremises?\u2014but those are further questions, which would remain to\nbe addressed.\n",
