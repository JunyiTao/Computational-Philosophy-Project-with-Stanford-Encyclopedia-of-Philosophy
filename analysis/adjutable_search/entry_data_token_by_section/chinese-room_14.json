    "main_text": "The Larger Philosophical Issues || Mind and Body\n5.4 Simulation, duplication and evolution\n\nIn discussing the CRA, Searle argues that there is an important\ndistinction between simulation and duplication. No one would mistake a\ncomputer simulation of the weather for weather, or a computer\nsimulation of digestion for real digestion. Searle concludes that it\nis just as serious a mistake to confuse a computer simulation of\nunderstanding with understanding.\n\nOn the face of it, there is generally an important distinction between\na simulation and the real thing. But two problems emerge. It is not\nclear that the distinction can always be made. Hearts are biological\nif anything is. Are artificial hearts simulations of hearts? Or are\nthey functional duplicates of hearts, hearts made from different\nmaterials? Walking is normally a biological phenomenon performed using\nlimbs. Do those with artificial limbs walk? Or do they simulate\nwalking? Do robots walk? If the properties that are needed to be\ncertain kind of thing are high-level properties, anything sharing\nthose properties will be a thing of that kind, even if it differs in\nits lower level properties. Chalmers (1996) offers a principle\ngoverning when simulation is replication. Chalmers suggests that,\ncontra Searle and Harnad (1989), a simulation of X can be an\nX, namely when the property of being an X is an\norganizational invariant, a property that depends only on the\nfunctional organization of the underlying system, and not on any other\ndetails.\n\nCopeland (2002) argues that the Church-Turing thesis does not entail\nthat the brain (or every machine) can be simulated by a universal\nTuring machine, for the brain (or other machine) might have primitive\noperations that are not simple clerical routines that can be carried\nout by hand. (An example might be that human brains likely display\ngenuine low-level randomness, whereas computers are carefully designed\nnot to do that, and so computers resort to pseudo-random numbers when\napparent randomness is needed.) Sprevak 2007 raises a related point.\nTuring\u2019s 1938 Princeton thesis described such machines\n(\u201cO-machines\u201d). O-machines are machines that include\nfunctions of natural numbers that are not Turing-machine computable.\nIf the brain is such a machine, then, says Sprevak,: \u201cThere is\nno possibility of Searle\u2019s Chinese Room Argument being\nsuccessfully deployed against the functionalist hypothesis that the\nbrain instantiates an O-machine\u2026.\u201d (120). \n\nCopeland discusses the simulation / duplication distinction in\nconnection with the Brain Simulator Reply. He argues that Searle\ncorrectly notes that one cannot infer from X simulates\nY, and Y has property P, to the conclusion\nthat therefore X has Y\u2019s property P\nfor arbitrary P. But Copeland claims that Searle himself\ncommits the simulation fallacy in extending the CR argument from\ntraditional AI to apply against computationalism. The contrapositive\nof the inference is logically equivalent \u2013 X simulates\nY, X does not have P therefore Y\ndoes not \u2013 where P is understands Chinese. The faulty\nstep is: the CR operator S simulates a neural net N,\nit is not the case that S understands Chinese, therefore it\nis not the case that N understands Chinese. Copeland also\nnotes results by Siegelmann and Sontag (1994) showing that some\nconnectionist networks cannot be simulated by a universal Turing\nMachine (in particular, where connection weights are real\nnumbers).\n\nThere is another problem with the simulation-duplication distinction,\narising from the process of evolution. Searle wishes to see original\nintentionality and genuine understanding as properties only of certain\nbiological systems, presumably the product of evolution. Computers\nmerely simulate these properties. At the same time, in the Chinese\nRoom scenario, Searle maintains that a system can exhibit behavior\njust as complex as human behavior, simulating any degree of\nintelligence and language comprehension that one can imagine, and\nsimulating any ability to deal with the world, yet not understand a\nthing. He also says that such behaviorally complex systems might be\nimplemented with very ordinary materials, for example with tubes of\nwater and valves.\n\nThis creates a biological problem, beyond the Other Minds problem\nnoted by early critics of the CR argument. While we may\npresuppose that others have minds, evolution makes no such\npresuppositions. The selection forces that drive biological evolution\nselect on the basis of behavior. Evolution can select for the ability\nto use information about the environment creatively and intelligently,\nas long as this is manifest in the behavior of the organism. If there\nis no overt difference in behavior in any set of circumstances between\na system that understands and one that does not, evolution cannot\nselect for genuine understanding. And so it seems that on\nSearle\u2019s account, minds that genuinely understand meaning have\nno advantage over creatures that merely process information, using\npurely computational processes. Thus a position that implies that\nsimulations of understanding can be just as biologically adaptive as\nthe real thing, leaves us with a puzzle about how and why systems with\n\u201cgenuine\u201d understanding could evolve. Original\nintentionality and genuine understanding become epiphenomenal.\nConclusion\n\nAs we have seen, since its appearance in 1980 the Chinese Room\nargument has sparked discussion across disciplines. Despite the\nextensive discussion there is still no consensus as to whether the\nargument is sound. At one end we have Julian Baggini\u2019s (2009)\nassessment that Searle \u201ccame up with perhaps the most famous\ncounter-example in history \u2013 the Chinese room argument \u2013\nand in one intellectual punch inflicted so much damage on the then\ndominant theory of functionalism that many would argue it has never\nrecovered.\u201d Whereas philosopher Daniel Dennett (2013, p. 320)\nconcludes that the Chinese Room argument is \u201cclearly a\nfallacious and misleading argument\u201d. Hence there is no consensus\nas to whether the argument is a proof that limits the aspirations of\nArtificial Intelligence or computational accounts of mind. \n\nMeanwhile work in artificial intelligence and natural language\nprocessing has continued. The CRA led Stevan Harnad and others on a\nquest for \u201csymbol grounding\u201d in AI. Many in philosophy\n(Dretske, Fodor, Millikan) worked on naturalistic theories of mental\ncontent. Speculation about the nature of consciousness continues in\nmany disciplines. And computers have moved from the lab to the pocket\nand the wrist.\n\nAt the time of Searle\u2019s construction of the argument, personal\ncomputers were very limited hobbyist devices. Weizenbaum\u2019s\n\u2018Eliza\u2019 and a few text \u2018adventure\u2019 games were\nplayed on DEC computers; these included limited parsers. More advanced\nparsing of language was limited to computer researchers such as\nSchank. Much changed in the next quarter century; billions now use\nnatural language to interrogate and command virtual agents via\ncomputers they carry in their pockets. Has the Chinese Room argument\nmoderated claims by those who produce AI and natural language systems?\nSome manufacturers linking devices to the \u201cinternet of\nthings\u201d make modest claims: appliance manufacturer LG says the\nsecond decade of the 21st century brings the \u201cexperience of\nconversing\u201d with major appliances. That may or may not be the\nsame as conversing. Apple is less cautious than LG in describing the\ncapabilities of its \u201cvirtual personal assistant\u201d\napplication called \u2018Siri\u2019: Apple says of Siri that\n\u201cIt understands what you say. It knows what you mean.\u201d IBM\nis quick to claim its much larger \u2018Watson\u2019 system is\nsuperior in language abilities to Siri. In 2011 Watson beat human\nchampions on the television game show \u2018Jeopardy\u2019, a feat\nthat relies heavily on language abilities and inference. IBM goes on\nto claim that what distinguishes Watson is that it \u201cknows what\nit knows, and knows what it does not know.\u201d This appears to be\nclaiming a form of reflexive self-awareness or consciousness for the\nWatson computer system. Thus the claims of strong AI now are hardly\nchastened, and if anything some are stronger and more exuberant. At\nthe same time, as we have seen, many others believe that the Chinese\nRoom Argument showed once and for all that at best computers can\nsimulate human cognition.\n\nThough separated by three centuries, Leibniz and Searle had similar\nintuitions about the systems they consider in their respective thought\nexperiments, Leibniz\u2019 Mill and the Chinese Room. In both cases\nthey consider a complex system composed of relatively simple\noperations, and note that it is impossible to see how understanding or\nconsciousness could result. These simple arguments do us the service\nof highlighting the serious problems we face in understanding meaning\nand minds. The many issues raised by the Chinese Room argument may not\nbe settled until there is a consensus about the nature of meaning, its\nrelation to syntax, and about the biological basis of consciousness.\nThere continues to be significant disagreement about what processes\ncreate meaning, understanding, and consciousness, as well as what can\nbe proven a priori by thought experiments.\n",
