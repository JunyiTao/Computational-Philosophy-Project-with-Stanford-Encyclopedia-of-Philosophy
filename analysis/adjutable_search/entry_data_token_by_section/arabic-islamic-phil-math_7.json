    "main_text": "Epistemology of Mathematics || Applicability and Reliability of Mathematics\n2.4 Applicability and Reliability of Mathematics\n\nIf we take mathematical objects as pure mental or estimative\n(mawh\u016bm) objects that are constructed by the mechanism\nof abstraction and have no extramental reality, then it is hardly\njustifiable that mathematics and/or mathematical models on their own\ncan give us reliable knowledge of the extramental world. It should\ncome as no surprise that those who endorse a non-Platonic,\nnon-literalist account of the ontology of mathematics will find this\nscience less certain and perhaps less valuable than sciences like\nphysics and metaphysics. That is why some contemporary scholars, who\nhave read Avicenna as defending a purely abstractionist account of the\nontology of mathematics, argue that for him, mathematics is less\nuseful and inferior to the other two sciences (Hasan 2017:\n225\u201326; Fazl\u0131o\u011flu 2014: 11\u201313). This rendition\nof Avicenna\u2019s view is of course problematic if we take him as a\nliteralist regarding the nature of mathematical objects. Motivated by\nsimilar concerns, Averroes believes that the fact that the realm of\nmathematical objects is detached from the extramental reality makes\nmathematics play a less significant role in human perfection than\nphysics and metaphysics (Endress 2003: 150).\n\nDoubts about the capability of mathematics to represent the\nextramental world accurately are even more prevalent among atomists\n(Dhanani 1994: 101\u201340; Pines 1936 [1997: 110]). For instance,\nendorsing physical atomism in his later works, Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nal-R\u0101z\u012b believes that since magnitudes are supposed to be\ncontinuous in Euclidean geometry, this science cannot present an\naccurate picture of the discontinuous atomistic world (Setia 2006:\n126\u201328).\n\nIn his Al-Maw\u0101qif, al-\u02be\u012aj\u012b challenges the\nreliability of mathematical sciences due to their engagement with\nestimative entities that are frailer (awhan) than a\nspider\u2019s web. This analogy refers to the Quran 29:41\n(Fazl\u0131o\u011flu 2014: 6\u20137). A similarly skeptical view of\nmathematics is defended by Shams al-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad\nal-Bukh\u0101r\u012b (d. 1429) in his commentary on\nal-K\u0101tib\u012b al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b\u2019s \u1e24ikma\nal-\u02bfayn. Like many of his predecessors, al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b\ncontends that, compared to physics and metaphysics, mathematics is a\nless reliable source of knowledge regarding the concretely existing\nthings. It is in response to such views that al-Jurj\u0101n\u012b\nappeals to the machinery of nafs al-\u02beamr to defend the\nreliability of mathematics. He accepts that mathematical objects are\nestimative and imaginary. But he believes that they are imagined\ncorrectly and in accordance with the extramental reality. In this\nrespect, they are entirely different from fictional entities, like\nruby mountains or two-headed men, which do not\nreflect anything in the extramental reality (Hasan 2017: 7). Although\nmathematics originates from estimation, it can still express\nsignificant truths about things as they are in nafs\nal-\u02beamr. He therefore believes that the judgment of\nestimation can in principle conform to that of intellect; particularly\nin the context of mathematics where the products of estimation are\nconstructed in accordance with what we perceive from the extramental\nworld through our senses. Although mathematical objects are estimative\nentities, they are not the outcome of a fanciful imagination which has\nno connection to reality, or so al-Jurj\u0101n\u012b seems to believe\n(Fazl\u0131o\u011flu 2014; Hasan 2017). The theory of nafs\nal-\u02beamr was, among other things, the most promising attempt\nby Muslim thinkers to reconcile an anti-realist account of the\nontology of mathematics with a realist account of mathematical truths.\nThis theory is intended to provide an explanation of how mathematics,\nas the study of purely estimative entities, can be useful in the study\nof the physical world. Unfortunately, the extent of the success of\nthis project has not been comprehensively studied yet.\n",
