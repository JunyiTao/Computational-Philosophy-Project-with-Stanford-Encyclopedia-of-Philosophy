    "main_text": "The \u201cpseudo\u201d of pseudoscience || A wider sense of pseudoscience\n3.4 A wider sense of pseudoscience\n\nSometimes the term \u201cpseudoscience\u201d is used in a wider\nsense than that which is captured in the definition constituted of (1)\nand (2\u2032). Contrary to (2\u2032), doctrines that conflict with\nscience are sometimes called \u201cpseudoscientific\u201d in spite\nof not being advanced as scientific. Hence, Grove (1985, 219) included\namong the pseudoscientific doctrines those that \u201cpurport to\noffer alternative accounts to those of science or claim to explain\nwhat science cannot explain.\u201d Similarly, Lugg (1987,\n227\u2013228) maintained that \u201cthe clairvoyant\u2019s\npredictions are pseudoscientific whether or not they are\ncorrect\u201d, despite the fact that most clairvoyants do not profess\nto be practitioners of science. In this sense, pseudoscience is\nassumed to include not only doctrines contrary to science\nproclaimed to be scientific but doctrines contrary to\nscience\u00a0tout court, whether or not they are put forward in\nthe name of science. Arguably, the crucial issue is not whether\nsomething is called \u201cscience\u201d but whether it is claimed to\nhave the function of science, namely to provide the most reliable\ninformation about its subject-matter. To cover this wider sense of\npseudoscience, (2\u2032) can be modified as follows (Hansson 1996,\n2013):\n\n(2\u2033)\nit is part of a doctrine whose major proponents try to create the\nimpression that it represents the most reliable knowledge on its\nsubject matter.\n\n\nCommon usage seems to vacillate between the definitions (1)+(2\u2032)\nand (1)+(2\u2033); and this in an interesting way: In their comments\non the meaning of the term, critics of pseudoscience tend to endorse a\ndefinition close to (1)+(2\u2032), but their actual usage is often\ncloser to (1)+(2\u2033).\n\nThe following examples serve to illustrate the difference between the\ntwo definitions and also to clarify why clause (1) is needed:\n\nA creationist book gives a correct account of the structure of\nDNA.\nAn otherwise reliable chemistry book gives an incorrect account of\nthe structure of DNA.\nA creationist book denies that the human species shares common\nancestors with other primates.\nA preacher who denies that science can be trusted also denies that\nthe human species shares common ancestors with other primates.\n\n\n(a) does not satisfy (1), and is therefore not pseudoscientific on\neither account. (b) satisfies (1) but neither (2\u2032) nor\n(2\u2033) and is therefore not pseudoscientific on either account.\n(c) satisfies all three criteria, (1), (2\u2032), and (2\u2033), and\nis therefore pseudoscientific on both accounts. Finally, (d) satisfies\n(1) and (2\u2033) and is therefore pseudoscientific according to\n(1)+(2\u2033) but not according to (1)+(2\u2032). As the last two\nexamples illustrate, pseudoscience and anti-science are sometimes\ndifficult to distinguish. Promoters of some pseudosciences (notably\nhomeopathy) tend to be ambiguous between opposition to science and\nclaims that they themselves represent the best science.\n",
