    "main_text": "Issues of Rhetoric and Risk\n5. Issues of Rhetoric and Risk\n\nFrom October 16th to 19th of 1980, a conference\non the subject of macroevolution was held at the Field Museum of\nNatural History in Chicago, Illinois. Shortly thereafter\u2014in the\nNovember 21, 1980 issue of Science\u2014an exciting report\non some events of the conference was published (Lewin 1980). The\nreport was entitled \u201cEvolutionary Theory under Fire\u201d, and\nit prompted a cascade of responses in the Letters section of\nScience\u2014an exchange of scientific correspondence that\ncontinued for almost two decades. Whatever the motives behind the\nheadlining of the report, it is empirically evident that the chosen\ntitle was inflammatory.\n\nThe February 21, 1981 issue of Science included no fewer than\n5 separate contributions (in order of printing: Futuyma et al. 1981;\nTempleton & Giddings 1981; Carson 1981; Olson 1981; Armstrong\n& Drummond 1981). The February 4, 1983 issue of Science\ncontained a letter by critics of PE (Schopf & Hoffman 1983) and a\nreply (Gould 1983). In the March 11 issue of that same year both prior\nparties were accused of prolonging a fruitless discussion of a\n\u201cphilosophically intractable\u201d and dubious\n\u201cpseudoquestion\u201d (Grant 1983: 1170). In April, one\ncorrespondent wrote in agreement with Grant (Schoch 1983) and another\nchided him for failing \u201cto explore and appreciate the latest\nblooming in the desert of dogma\u201d (Maderson 1983: 360). To put it\nmildly, and purely descriptively: many of the responses elicited by\nthe original report were impassioned and emotive.\n\nIn the February 14, 1986 issue of Science, the original\nreporter on the macroevolutionary conference fanned the flames with\nanother piece, one entitled \u201cPunctuated Equilibrium is Now Old\nHat\u201d (Lewin 1986). In March, Jeffrey Levinton registered an\nardent objection to Lewin\u2019s characterization of the theory as\nwidely accepted, as well as to PE in general (Levinton 1986). In\nApril, Gould responded (Gould 1986), and in May, Robert Eckhardt\nresponded to Gould\u2019s response (Eckhard 1986). Throughout these\nexchanges and related ones, many interesting meta-scientific charges\nwere laid and lobbed. Questions of \u201cwhere is the\nevidence?\u201d as well as accusations of dogma, religionism,\nrevisionism, sloganeering, and vagueness abounded.\n\nSo did references to creationism, specifically. The very first batch\nof letters in response to Lewin\u2019s initial piece included one\nobjecting strongly to the choice of title (Armstrong & Drummond\n1981). The correspondents wrote that \u201cthis article is\nundoubtedly destined to enter the out-of-context arsenal that has\nbecome a mainstay of recent creationist literature\u201d (Armstrong\n& Drummond 1981: 774). Incidentally, the correspondents were\ncorrect about this (e.g., Meyer 1994; Parker 2006).\n\nAnd in the March 10, 1995 issue, a different journalist for\nScience published another piece, this one entitled \u201cDid\nDarwin Get It All Right?\u201d (Kerr 1995). By May 5, a scientist had\nwritten in to protest the use of such an inflammatory headline\n(McInerney 1995), referencing Lewin\u2019s original piece (from\n1980). McInerney wrote that Lewin\u2019s earlier piece had\n\u201cprovided a gold mine for subsequent creationist\npropaganda\u201d (1995: 624). He bemoaned the fact that another such\nheadline had just been published by Science, and recommended\nthat \u201ca journal representing some 130,000 scientists be a bit\nmore judicious in its choice of headlines\u201d (1995: 624).\n\nThese references to a wider social context\u2014the one in which such\nardent macroevolutionary debate is being held\u2014raise interesting\nissues that have perhaps been somewhat neglected by philosophers of\nscience (though see the entry on\n  the social dimensions of scientific knowledge).\n Do the scientists involved in this dispute, and the\nscientific journalists reporting on it, have a responsibility to\nconsider the (unintended yet foreseeable and potentially avoidable)\nuses to which their headlines might be put (by creationists and other\nparties)? Some scientific correspondents evidently think they do. And\nif such responsibility exists, does it fall upon the shoulders of the\nscientist qua scientist\u2014or upon the shoulders of the\nscientist qua citizen, or scientist qua educator?\nPhilosophers focusing on the relation between science and value have\ndone some relevant work on questions like these, usually while\nfocusing on other scientific domains\u2014work which could be applied\nto macroevolutionary instances and issues (e.g., Rudner 1953; Hempel\n1960; Longino 1990; Douglas 2000, 2009; Kourany 2010).\n\nThese are not the only issues of provocative linguistic expression\nawaiting further exploration by philosophers of macroevolution.\nQuestions of what it means to sit \u201cat the high table\u201d\n(Maynard Smith 1984; Sepkoski 2014) or to \u201creplay life\u2019s\ntape\u201d (Gould 1989; Beatty 2006; Sepkoski 2016) are perhaps more\nfamiliar to philosophers of biology, but still worth exploring.\n",
