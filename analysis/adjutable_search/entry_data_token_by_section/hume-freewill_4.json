    "main_text": "Moral Sense and Moral Capacity\n6. Free Will and the Problem of Religion\nIn the Treatise, as was noted earlier, Hume argues that one of the reasons \u201cwhy the doctrine of liberty [of indifference] has generally been better receiv\u2019d in the world, than its antagonist [the doctrine of necessity], proceeds from religion, which has been very unnecessarily interested in this question\u201d (T 2.3.2.3/409). He goes on to argue \u201cthat the doctrine of necessity, according to my explication of it, is not only innocent, but even advantageous to religion and morality\u201d. When Hume came to present his views afresh in the Enquiry (Sec. 8), he was less circumspect about his hostile intentions with regard to \u201creligion\u201d. In the parallel passage (EU 8.26/96\u201397), he again objects to any effort to refute a hypothesis \u201cby a pretence to its dangerous consequences to religion and morality\u201d. He goes on to say that his account of the doctrines of liberty and necessity \u201care not only consistent with morality, but are absolutely essential to its support\u201d (EU 8.26/97). By this means, he makes it clear that he is not claiming that his position is \u201cconsistent\u201d with religion. In the final passages of the Enquiry discussion of liberty and necessity (EU 8.32\u20136/99\u2013103) \u2013 passages which do not appear in the original Treatise discussion \u2013 Hume makes it plain exactly how his necessitarian principles have \u201cdangerous consequences for religion\u201d.\nHume considers the following objection:\nIt may be said, for instance, that, if voluntary actions be subjected to the same laws of necessity with the operations of matter, there is a continued chain of necessary causes, pre-ordained and pre-determined, reaching from the original cause of all to every single volition of every human creature\u2026 . The ultimate Author of all our volitions is the Creator of the world, who first bestowed motion on this immense machine, and placed all beings in that particular position, whence every subsequent event, by an inevitable necessity, must result. Human action, therefore, either can have no moral turpitude at all, as proceeding from so good a cause; or if they have any turpitude, they must involve our Creator in the same guilt, while he is acknowledged to be their ultimate cause and author. (EU 8.32/99\u2013100)\nIn other words, the doctrine of necessity produces an awkward dilemma for the theological position: Either the distinction between (moral) good and evil collapses, because everything is produced by a perfect being who intends \u201cnothing but what is altogether good and laudable\u201d (EU 8.33/101), or we must \u201cretract the attribute of perfection, which we ascribe to the Deity\u201d on the ground that he is the ultimate author of moral evil in the world.\nHume treats the first horn of this dilemma at greatest length. He draws on his naturalistic principles to show that the conclusion reached (i.e., that no human actions are evil or criminal in nature) is absurd. There are, he claims, both physical and moral evils in this world that the human mind finds naturally painful, and this affects our sentiments accordingly. Whether we are the victim of gout or of robbery, we naturally feel the pain of such evils (EU 8.34/101\u20132). No \u201cremote speculations\u201d or \u201cphilosophical theories\u201d concerning the good or perfection of the whole universe will alter these natural reactions and responses to the particular ills and evils we encounter. Hence, even if we were to grant that this is indeed the best of all possible worlds \u2013 and Hume clearly takes the view that we have no reason to suppose that it is (D 113\u20134; EU 11.15\u201322/137\u201342) \u2013 this would do nothing to undermine the reality of the distinction we draw between good and evil (i.e., as experienced on the basis of \u201cthe natural sentiments of the human mind\u201d: EU 8.35/103).\nWhat, then, of the alternative view, that God is \u201cthe ultimate author of guilt and moral turpitude in all his creatures\u201d? Hume offers two rather different accounts of this alternative \u2013 although he does not distinguish them properly. He begins by noting that if some human actions \u201chave any turpitude, they must involve our Creator in the same guilt, while he is acknowledged to be their ultimate cause and author\u201d (EU 8.32/100). This passage suggests that God is also blameworthy for criminal actions in this world, since he is their \u201cultimate author\u201d. At this point, however, there is no suggestion that the particular human agents who commit these crimes (as preordained by God) are not accountable for them. In the passage that follows this is the position taken.\nFor as a man, who fired a mine, is answerable for all the consequences whether the train he employed be long or short; so wherever a continued chain of necessary causes is fixed, that Being, either finite or infinite, who produces the first, is likewise the author of all the rest, and must both bear the blame and acquire the praise which belong to them. (EU 8.32/100)\nHume goes on to argue that this rule of morality has even \u201cgreater force\u201d when applied to God, since he is neither ignorant nor impotent and must, therefore, have knowingly produced those criminal actions which are manifest in the world. Granted that such actions are indeed criminal, it follows, says Hume, \u201cthat the Deity, not man, is accountable for them\u201d (EU 8.32/100; cf. EU 8.33/101).\nIt is evident that Hume is arguing two points. First, if God is the creator of the world and preordained and predetermined everything that happens in it, then the (obvious) existence of moral evil is attributable to him, and thus \u201cwe must retract the attribute of perfection\u201d which we ascribe to him. Second, if God is indeed the ultimate author of moral evil, then no individual human being is accountable for the criminal actions he performs. The second claim does not follow from the first. Moreover, it is clearly inconsistent with Hume\u2019s general position on this subject. As has been noted, in this same context, Hume has also argued that no speculative philosophical theory can alter the natural workings of our moral sentiments. The supposition that God is the \u201cultimate author\u201d of all that takes place in the world will not, on this view of things, change our natural disposition to praise or blame our fellow human beings. Whatever the ultimate causes of a person\u2019s character and conduct, it will (inevitably) arouse a sentiment of praise or blame in other humans who contemplate it. This remains the case even if we suppose that God also deserves blame for the \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d we find in the world. In general, then, Hume\u2019s first formulation of the second alternative (i.e., that God must share the blame for those crimes that occur in the world) is more consistent with his naturalistic principles.\nWhat is crucial to Hume\u2019s polemical purpose in these passages is not the thesis that if God is the author of crimes then his human creations are not accountable for them. Rather, the point Hume is concerned to make (since he does not, in fact, doubt the inescapability of our moral accountability to our fellow human beings) is that the religious hypothesis leads to the \u201cabsurd consequence\u201d that God is the ultimate author of sin in this world and that he is, accordingly, liable to some appropriate measure of blame. Hume, in other words, takes the (deeply impious) step of showing that if God exists, and is the creator of the universe, then he is no more free of sin than human beings are. According to Hume, we must judge God as we judge human beings, on the basis of his effects in the world, and we must then adjust our sentiments accordingly. Indeed, there is no other natural or reasonable basis on which to found our sentiments toward God. In certain respects, therefore, we can make better sense of how we (humans) can hold God accountable than we can make sense of how God is supposed to hold humans accountable (i.e., since we have no knowledge of his sentiments, or even if he has any; cf. D 58,114,128\u20139; ESY 594; but see also LET I/51). It is, of course, Hume\u2019s considered view that it is an egregious error of speculative theology and philosophy to suppose that the universe has been created by a being that bears some (close) resemblance to humankind. The question of the origin of the universe is one that Hume plainly regards as beyond the scope of human reason (see, e.g., EU 1.11\u20132;11.15\u201323;11.26\u20137;12.2634/11\u201313, 137\u201342, 144\u201347, 165; D 36\u20138,88\u20139,107). Nevertheless, Hume\u2019s point is plain: On the basis of the (limited) evidence that is available to us, we must suppose that if there is a God, who is creator of this world and who orders all that takes place in it, then this being is indeed accountable for all the (unnecessary and avoidable; D 107) evil that we discover in it.\nAlthough it is evident that Hume\u2019s discussion of free will in the first Enquiry is part of his wider critique of the Christian religion, it is nevertheless widely held that Hume\u2019s earlier discussion \u201cOf liberty and necessity\u201d in the Treatise carries none of this irreligious content or significance. This view is itself encouraged by a more general understanding of the relationship between the Treatise and the first Enquiry which maintains that the Treatise lacks any significant irreligious content (because Hume \u201ccastrated\u201d his work and removed most passages of this kind, perhaps including the passages at EU 8.32\u20136). On this view of things, the elements of Hume\u2019s discussion that are common to both Treatise 2.3.1\u20132 and Enquiry 8 are themselves without any particular religious or irreligious significance. To show why this view is seriously mistaken would, however, take us wide of our present concerns. (For a more detailed account of Hume\u2019s fundamental irreligious intentions throughout the Treatise see Russell, 2008 and also Russell, 2016.)\nSuffice it to note, for our present purposes, that throughout his writings, Hume\u2019s philosophical interests and concerns were very largely dominated and directed by his fundamental irreligious aims and objectives. A basic theme in Hume\u2019s philosophy, so considered, is his effort to demystify moral and social life and release it from the metaphysical trappings of \u201csuperstition\u201d. The core thesis of Hume\u2019s Treatise \u2013 indeed, of his overall (irreligious or \u201catheistic\u201d) philosophical outlook \u2013 is that moral and social life neither rests upon nor requires the dogmas of Christian metaphysics. Hume\u2019s naturalistic framework for understanding moral and social life excludes not only the metaphysics of libertarianism (e.g., modes of \u201cmoral\u201d causation by immaterial agents) but also all further theologically inspired metaphysics that generally accompanies it (i.e., God, the immortal soul, a future state, and so on). The metaphysics of religion, Hume suggests, serves only to confuse and obscure our understanding of these matters and to hide their true foundation in human nature. Hume\u2019s views on the subject of free will and moral responsibility, as presented in the sections \u201cOf liberty and necessity\u201d and elsewhere in his writings, are the very pivot on which this fundamental thesis turns.\n",
