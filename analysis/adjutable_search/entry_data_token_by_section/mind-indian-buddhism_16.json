    "main_text": "Theories of Mind || Appropriation in the Mental Stream\n5.3 Appropriation in the Mental Stream\n\n\nIn seeking to reconcile the Abhidharma analysis of mind, and its \nsynchronic model of momentary cognitive events, with the diachronic \nphenomenon of karmic activity, the Abhidharma philosophers came up \nwith different solutions. The Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika (also referred in\nthe literature as the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins), solved the problem \nof the continuity of karmic potential by proposing an ontology of the\nconstitutive elements of reality (or dharmas) as existing in\nall three temporal dimensions: past, present, and future. On this \nontological model, dharmas do not change, only their temporal \ncondition does. The principal reason for adopting this peculiar \nontology is the theory of the momentariness \n(k\u1e63a\u1e47ikav\u0101da) of all phenomena: if nothing \nendures for more than a moment how, then, can a cause that is no \nlonger present lead to a manifest result? Similarly, if the \naccumulated karmic potential from past experience is no longer \npresent, how could it affect the present condition? But in \npostulating the existence of the constituent elements of experience \nthroughout the three temporal dimensions, the \nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins simply shifted the Abhidharma problematic: \nhaving presumably explained what accounts for the efficacy of \naccumulated karmic potential, the question now is why a karmic result\narises at one time rather than another? [for detailed discussions of \nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika ontology and its analysis of mind see Williams \n1981, Bastow 1994, and Cox 1995] \n\n\nThe Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika solution consists in the introduction of a \nnew type of dharma, that of appropriation (pr\u0101pti), \nwhose persistence in the mental stream is not due to any other \nfactors, including the results of past actions, but rather to its own\ncapacity to replicate itself. The presence of a factor of \nappropriation in the mental stream thus ensures the karmic \nefficacy of past causal chains. It also explains why mental factors \nand events remain associated with a given mental stream. This new \ndharma of appropriation is classified as being dissociated from \nthought and as neutral; it is also classified as being one of the \ndetermining factors for differentiating one mental stream from \nanother (see AKBh ad II 35). Furthermore, it explains why \ncertain dispositions, such as aversion, persist in the mental stream \nof an individual (because appropriation follows the initial \nexperience of a first moment of aversion), and how it is possible to \novercome such dispositions (when appropriation is associated with \nfactors that condition non-aversive states of mind). In both cases, \nthe concept of appropriation provides an account of continuity in the\nmental stream that goes against the stipulations of the Abhidharmic \nprinciple of the momentariness of mental states. Thus, the \nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika solution to reconciling the theory of causality\nwith the theory of the momentariness of all phenomena rests on a \nnotion that itself defies explanation, prompting traditional critics \nsuch as Vasubandhu to ask whether appropriation is a real entity or a\nmerely conventional one, and in the end to dismiss it altogether (see\nAKBh ad II 36cd). \n",
