    "preamble": "\n\nGeorge Herbert Mead (1863\u20131931), American philosopher and social\ntheorist, is often classed with William James, Charles Sanders Peirce,\nand John Dewey as one of the most significant figures in classical\nAmerican pragmatism. Dewey referred to Mead as \u201ca seminal mind\nof the very first order\u201d (Dewey, 1932, xl). Yet by the middle of\nthe twentieth-century, Mead\u2019s prestige was greatest outside of\nprofessional philosophical circles. He is considered by many to be the\nfather of the school of Symbolic Interactionism in sociology and\nsocial psychology, although he did not use this nomenclature. Perhaps\nMead\u2019s principal influence in philosophical circles occurred as\na result of his friendship with John Dewey. There is little question\nthat Mead and Dewey had an enduring influence on each other, with Mead\ncontributing an original theory of the development of the self through\ncommunication. This theory has in recent years played a central role\nin the work of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. While Mead is best known for his\nwork on the nature of the self and intersubjectivity, he also\ndeveloped a theory of action, and a metaphysics or philosophy of\nnature that emphasizes emergence and temporality, in which the past\nand future are viewed through the lens of the present. Although the\nextent of Mead\u2019s reach is considerable, he never published a\nmonograph in philosophy. His most famous work, Mind, Self, and\nSociety: From the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist, was\npublished after his death and is a compilation of student notes and\nselections from unpublished manuscripts.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Influences\n\nGeorge Herbert Mead was born on February 27, 1863, in South Hadley,\nMassachusetts. His father, Hiram Mead, a minister in the\nCongregational Church, moved his family from Massachusetts to Ohio in\n1869 in order to join the faculty of The Oberlin Theological Seminary.\nAt Oberlin he taught homiletics and held the chair in Sacred Rhetoric\nand Pastoral Theology. Mead would attend Oberlin College from\n1879\u20131883, and matriculate at Harvard from 1887\u20131888. At\nHarvard he studied with Josiah Royce, a philosopher deeply indebted to\nG.W.F. Hegel, who also left a lasting impression on Mead. (Mead met\nWilliam James at Harvard, although he did not study with him. Almost\nimmediately after graduation, Mead resided in William James\u2019s\nsummer home tutoring his son Harry.) Mead\u2019s mother, Elizabeth\nStorrs Billings, was a devoutly religious woman, who taught at Oberlin\nfor two years after the death of her husband in 1881, and served as\npresident of Mount Holyoke College from 1890\u20131900. After his\ncollege years, Mead became a committed naturalist and non-believer,\nbut he had struggled for years with the religious convictions that he\nhad inherited from his family and community. For a period of time\nafter college he even considered Christian Social Work as a career,\nbut 1884 he explained in a letter to his friend Henry Castle why this\ncareer path would be problematic.\n\nI shall have to let persons understand that I have some belief in\nChristianity and my praying be interpreted as a belief in God, whereas\nI have no doubt that now the most reasonable system of the universe\ncan be formed to myself without a God. But notwithstanding all this I\ncannot go out with the world and not work for men. The spirit of a\nminister is strong with me and I come fairly by it. (Shalin 1988,\n920\u2013921)\n\n\nMead did indeed move away from his earlier religious roots, but the\nactivist spirit remained with him. Mead marched in support of\nwomen\u2019s suffrage, served as a treasurer for the Settlement House\nmovement, immersed himself in civic matters in Chicago, and generally\nsupported progressive causes. Jane Addams was a close friend. In terms\nof his transformation into a naturalist, no doubt Darwin played a\nsignificant role. As a matter of fact, one can understand much of\nMead\u2019s work as an attempt to synthesize Darwin, Hegel,\nDewey\u2019s functionalist turn in psychology, and insights gleaned\nfrom James. Mead taught with Dewey at the University of Michigan from\n1891\u20131894, and when Dewey was made chair at the University of\nChicago in 1894, he requested that Mead receive an appointment. Mead\nspent the rest of his career at Chicago. But before he began teaching\nat Michigan, Mead was directly exposed to major currents of European\nthought when he studied in Germany from 1888\u20131891, taking two\ncourses from Wilhelm Dilthey and immersing himself in Wilhelm\nWundt\u2019s research.\n2. Language and Mind\n\nDewey and Mead were not only very close friends, they shared similar\nintellectual trajectories. Both went through a period in which Hegel\nwas the most significant philosophical figure for them, and both\ndemocratized and de-essentialized Hegelian ideas about the self and\ncommunity. Nevertheless, neo-hegelian organic metaphors and notions of\nnegation and conflict, reinterpreted as the problematic situation,\nremain central to their positions. The teleological also remains\nimportant in their thought, but it is reduced in scale from the world\nhistorical and localized in terms of anticipatory experiences and goal\noriented activities.\n\nFor Mead, the development of the self is intimately tied to the\ndevelopment of language. To demonstrate this connection, Mead begins\nby articulating what he learned about the gesture from Wundt. Gestures\nare to be understood in terms of the behavioral responses of animals\nto stimuli from other organisms. For example, a dog barks, and a\nsecond dog either barks back or runs away. The \u201cmeaning\u201d\nof the \u201cbarking gesture\u201d is found in the response of the\nsecond organism to the first. But dogs do not understand the\n\u201cmeaning\u201d of their gestures. They simply respond, that is,\nthey use symbols without what Mead refers to as\n\u201csignificance.\u201d For a gesture to have significance, it\nmust call out in a second organism a response that is functionally\nidentical to the response that the first organism anticipates. In\nother words, for a gesture to be significant it must\n\u201cmean\u201d the same thing to both organisms, and\n\u201cmeaning\u201d involves the capacity to consciously anticipate\nhow other organisms will respond to symbols or gestures. How does this\ncapacity arise? It does so through the vocal gesture.\n\nA vocal gesture can be thought of as a word or phrase. When a vocal\ngesture is used the individual making the gesture responds\n(implicitly) in the same manner as the individual hearing it. If you\nare about to walk across a busy street during rush hour, I might shout\nout, \u201cDon\u2019t walk!\u201d As I shout, I hear my gesture the\nway in which you hear it, that is, I hear the same words, and I might\nfeel myself pulling back, stopping in my tracks because I hear these\nwords. But, of course, I don\u2019t hear them exactly as you do,\nbecause I am aware of directing them to you. According to Mead,\n\u201cGestures become significant symbols when they implicitly arouse\nin the individual making them the same responses which the explicitly\narouse, or are supposed to arouse, in other individuals\u201d (MSS,\n47). He also tells us that, \u201cthe critical importance of language\nin the development of human experience lies in this fact that the\nstimulus is one that can react upon the speaking individual as it\nreacts upon the other\u201d (MSS, 69).\n\nAs noted, Mead was indebted to Hegel\u2019s work, and the notion of\nreflexivity plays a fundamental role in Mead\u2019s theory of mind.\nVocal gestures\u2014which depend on sufficiently sophisticated\nnervous systems to process them\u2014allow individuals to hear their\nown gestures in the way that others hear them. If I shout\n\u201cBoo\u201d at you, I might not only scare you, I might scare\nmyself. Or, to put this in other terms, vocal gestures allow one to\nspeak to oneself when others are not present. I make certain vocal\ngestures and anticipate how they would be responded to by others, even\nwhen they are not present. The responses of others have been\ninternalized and have become part of an accessible repertoire. (Mead\nwould agree with Ludwig Wittgenstein that there are no private\nlanguages. Language is social all the way down.) According to Mead,\nthrough the use of vocal gestures one can turn\n\u201cexperience\u201d back on itself through the loop of speaking\nand hearing at relatively the same instant. And when one is part of a\ncomplex network of language users, Mead argues that this reflexivity,\nthe \u201cturning back\u201d of experience on itself, allows mind to\ndevelop.\n\n\nMentality on our approach simply comes in when the organism is able to\npoint out meanings to others and to himself. This is the point at\nwhich mind appears, or if you like, emerges\u2026. It is absurd to\nlook at the mind simply from the standpoint of the individual human\norganism; for, although it has its focus there, it is essentially a\nsocial phenomenon; even its biological functions are primarily social.\n(MSS, 132\u2013133)\n\nIt is by means of reflexiveness\u2014the turning back of the\nexperience of the individual upon himself\u2014that the whole social\nprocess is thus brought into the experience of the individuals\ninvolved in it; it is by such means, which enable the individual to\ntake the attitude of the other toward himself, that the individual is\nable consciously to adjust himself to that process, and to modify the\nresultant of that process in any given social act in terms of his\nadjustment to it. Reflexiveness, then, is the essential condition,\nwithin the social process, for the development of mind. (MSS, 134)\n\n\nMind is developed not only through the use of vocal gestures, but\nthrough the taking of roles, which will be addressed below. Here it is\nworth noting that although we often employ our capacity for\nreflexivity to engage in reflection or deliberation, both Dewey and\nMead argue that habitual, non-deliberative, experience constitutes the\nmost common way that we engage the world. The habitual involves a host\nof background beliefs and assumptions that are not raised to the level\nof (self) conscious reflection unless problems occur that warrant\naddressing. For Dewey, this background is described as \u201cfunded\nexperience.\u201d For Mead, it is the world that this there\nand the \u201cbiologic individual.\u201d\n\nThe immediate experience which is reality, and which is the final test\nof the reality of scientific hypotheses as well as the test of the\ntruth of all our ideas and suppositions, is the experience of what I\nhave called the \u201cbiologic individual.\u201d\u2026[This] term\nlays emphasis on the living reality which may be distinguished from\nreflection\u2026. Actual experience did not take place in this form\nbut in the form of unsophisticated reality. (MSS, 352\u2013353)\n\n3. Roles, the Self, and the Generalized Other\n\nOne of the most noteworthy features of Mead\u2019s account of the\nsignificant symbol is that it assumes that anticipatory experiences\nare fundamental to the development of language. We have the ability to\nplace ourselves in the positions of others\u2014that is, to\nanticipate their responses\u2014with regard to our linguistic\ngestures. This ability is also crucial for the development of the self\nand self-consciousness. For Mead, as for Hegel, the self is\nfundamentally social and cognitive. It should be distinguished from\nthe individual, who also has non-cognitive attributes. The self, then,\nis not identical to the individual and is linked to\nself-consciousness. It begins to develop when individuals interact\nwith others and play roles. What are roles? They are constellations of\nbehaviors that are responses to sets of behaviors of other human\nbeings. The notions of role-taking and role playing are familiar from\nsociological and social-psychological literature. For example, the\nchild plays at being a doctor by having another child play at being a\npatient. To play at being a doctor, however, requires being able to\nanticipate what a patient might say, and vice versa. Role playing\ninvolves taking the attitudes or perspectives of others. It is worth\nnoting in this context that while Mead studied physiological\npsychology, his work on role-taking can be viewed as combining\nfeatures of the work of the Scottish sympathy theorists (which James\nappealed to in The Principles of Psychology), with\nHegel\u2019s dialectic of self and other. As we will discover\nshortly, perspective-taking is associated not only with roles, but\nwith far more complex behaviors.\n\nFor Mead, if we were simply to take the roles of others, we would\nnever develop selves or self-consciousness. We would have a nascent\nform of self-consciousness that parallels the sort of reflexive\nawareness that is required for the use of significant symbols. A\nrole-taking (self) consciousness of this sort makes possible what\nmight be called a proto-self, but not a self, because it doesn\u2019t\nhave the complexity necessary to give rise to a self. How then does a\nself arise? Here Mead introduces his well-known neologism,\nthe generalized other. When children or adults take\nroles, they can be said to be playing these roles in dyads. However,\nthis sort of exchange is quite different from the more complex sets of\nbehaviors that are required to participate in games. In the latter, we\nare required to learn not only the responses of specific others, but\nbehaviors associated with every position on the field. These can be\ninternalized, and when we succeed in doing so we come to\n\u201cview\u201d our own behaviors from the perspective of the game\nas a whole, which is a system of organized actions.\n\nThe organized community or social group which gives to the individual\nhis unity of self may be called \u201cthe generalized other.\u201d\nThe attitude of the generalized other is the attitude of the whole\ncommunity. Thus, for example, in the case of such a social group as a\nball team, the team is the generalized other in so far as it\nenters\u2014as an organized process or social activity\u2014into the\nexperience of any one of the individual members of it. (MSS, 154)\n\n\nFor Mead, although these communities can take different forms, they\nshould be thought of as systems; for example, a family can be thought\nof systemically and can therefore give rise to a generalized other and\na self that corresponds to it. Generalized others can also be found\nin\n\nconcrete social classes or subgroups, such as political parties,\nclubs, corporations, which are all actually functional social units,\nin terms of which their individual members are directly related to one\nanother. The others are abstract social classes or subgroups, such as\nthe class of debtors and the class of creditors, in terms of which\ntheir individual members are related to one another only more or less\nindirectly. (MSS, 157)\n\n\nIn his Principles of Psychology, a book Mead knew well,\nWilliam James discusses various types of empirical selves, namely, the\nmaterial, the social, and the spiritual. In addressing the social\nself, James notes how it is possible to have multiple selves.\n\nProperly speaking, a man has as many social selves as there are\nindividuals who recognize him and carry an image of him in their\nmind. To wound any one of these his images is to wound him. But as the\nindividuals who carry the images fall naturally into classes, we may\npractically say that he has as many different social selves as there\nare distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares.\nHe generally shows a different side of himself to each of these\ndifferent groups. (James 1890, 294)\n\n\nFrom Mead\u2019s vantage point, James was on the right track.\nHowever, the notion of audience is left undeveloped in James, as is\nthe manner in which language is utilized in the genesis of the self\nand self-consciousness. For Mead, James\u2019s audiences should be\nthought of in terms of systemically organized groups, such as we find\nin certain games, which give rise to generalized others. Further, we\nneed an account of how we come to view ourselves from the perspective\nof these groups that goes beyond the concept of \u201csympathetic\nattachments.\u201d Such an account involves reflexivity, which\noriginates with the vocal gesture and is essential to taking roles and\nthe perspective of the generalized other. In addition, reflexivity\nhelps make possible the capacity to \u201csee\u201d ourselves from\never wider or more \u201cuniversal\u201d communities. Mead relates\nthe latter capacity to cosmopolitan political and cultural\norientations. It\u2019s worth noting that for Mead a full account of\nthe self should address the phylogenetic as well as the\nontogenetic.\n4. The \u201cI\u201d and the \u201cMe\u201d\n\nOne of Mead\u2019s most significant contributions to social\npsychology is his distinction between the \u201cI\u201d and the\n\u201cMe.\u201d It\u2019s worth emphasizing that while this\ndistinction is utilized in sociological circles, it is grounded\nphilosophically for Mead. His target, in part, is no less than the\nidea of the transcendental ego, especially in its Kantian incarnation.\nIt is also important to note that the \u201cI\u201d and\n\u201cMe\u201d are functional distinctions for Mead, not\nmetaphysical ones. He refers to them as phases of the self (MSS 178,\n200), although he more typically uses the word self to refer to the\n\u201cMe\u201d (Aboulafia 2016).\n\nThe self that arises in relationship to a specific generalized other\nis referred to as the \u201cMe.\u201d The \u201cMe\u201d is a\ncognitive object, which is only known retrospectively, that is, on\nreflection. When we act in habitual ways we are not typically\nself-conscious. We are engaged in actions at a non-reflective level.\nHowever, when we take the perspective of the generalized other, we are\nboth \u201cwatching\u201d and forming a self in relationship to the\nsystem of behaviors that constitute this generalized other. So, for\nexample, if I am playing second base, I may reflect on my position as\na second baseman, but to do so I have to be able to think of\n\u201cmyself\u201d in relationship to the whole game, namely, the\nother actors and the rules of the game. We might refer to this\ncognitive object as my (second baseman) baseball self or\n\u201cMe.\u201d Perhaps a better example might be to think of the\nself in relationship to one\u2019s family of origin. In this\nsituation, one views oneself from the perspective of the various sets\nof behaviors that constitute the family system.\n\nTo return to the baseball example, one may have a self, a\n\u201cMe,\u201d that corresponds to a particular position that one\nplays, which is nested within the game as an organized totality. This\nself, however, doesn\u2019t tell us how any particular play may be\nmade. When a ball is grounded to a second baseman, how he or she\nreacts is not predetermined. He reacts, and how he reacts is always to\nsome degree different from how he has reacted in the past. These\nreactions or actions of the individual, whether in response to others\nor self-initiated, fall within the \u201csphere\u201d of the\n\u201cI.\u201d Every response that the \u201cI\u201d makes is\nsomewhat novel. Its responses may differ only in small ways from\nprevious responses, making them functionally equivalent, but they will\nnever be exactly the same. No catch in a ball game is ever identical\nto a previous catch. Mead declares that, \u201cThe \u2018I\u2019\ngives the sense of freedom, of initiative. The situation is there for\nus to act in a self-conscious fashion. We are aware of ourselves, and\nof what the situation is, but exactly how we will act never gets into\nexperience until after the action takes place\u201d (MSS,\n177\u2013178). The \u201cI\u201d is a \u201csource\u201d of both\nspontaneity and creativity. For Mead, however, the \u201cI\u201d is\nnot a noumenal ego. Nor is it a substance. It is a way of designating\na locus of activity.\n\nThe responses of the \u201cI\u201d are non-reflective. How the\n\u201cI\u201d reacts is known only on reflection, that is, after we\nretrospect.\n\nIf you ask, then, where directly in your own experience the\n\u201cI\u201d comes in, the answer is that it comes in as a\nhistorical figure. It is what you were a second ago that is the\n\u201cI\u201d of the \u201cme.\u201d It is another\n\u201cme\u201d that has to take that r\u00f4le. You cannot get the\nimmediate response of the \u201cI\u201d in the process. (MSS, 174)\n\n\nIn other words, once the actions of the \u201cI\u201d have become\nobjectified and known, by definition they have become a\n\u201cMe.\u201d The status of the \u201cI\u201d is interesting in\nMead. In trying to differentiate it from the empirical, knowable,\n\u201cMe,\u201d he states, \u201cThe \u2018I\u2019 is the\ntranscendental self of Kant, the soul that James conceived behind the\nscene holding on to the skirts of an idea to give it an added\nincrement of emphasis\u201d (MSC in SW, 141). However, this statement\nshould not to be interpreted as endorsing the notion of a\ntranscendental ego. Mead is seeking to emphasize that the\n\u201cI\u201d is not available to us in our acts, that is, it is\nonly knowable in its objectified form as a \u201cMe.\u201d This\npoint is clarified by a remark that directly follows the statement\njust cited. \u201cThe self-conscious, actual self in social\nintercourse is the objective \u2018me\u2019 or\n\u2018me\u2019s\u2019 with the process of response continually\ngoing on and implying a fictitious \u2018I\u2019 always out of sight\nof himself\u201d (MSC in SW, 141). A transcendental ego is not\nfictitious. But for Mead, since we are dealing with a functional\ndistinction here, it is quite acceptable to refer to the\n\u201cI\u201d as fictitious in a metaphysical sense.\n\nWhy, then, do we seem to experience what Mead refers to as a\n\u201crunning current of awareness,\u201d that is, an ego that\nappears to be aware of itself as it acts and thinks, if the\n\u201cI\u201d is not immediately aware of itself (SS in SW, 144)?\nWilliam James sought to explain this phenomenon in terms of\nproprioception and the relationship between \u201cparts\u201d of the\nstream of consciousness. (James 1890, 296\u2013307; James 1904,\n169\u2013183; James 1905, 184\u2013194). Mead developed a unique\nexplanation based on the relationship of the \u201cI\u201d to the\n\u201cMe.\u201d As we have seen, the \u201cI\u201d reacts and\ninitiates action, but the actions taken are comprehended, objectified,\nas a \u201cMe.\u201d However, the \u201cMe\u201d is not simply\nconfined to the objectifications of the immediate actions of the\n\u201cI.\u201d The \u201cMe\u201d carries with it internalized\nresponses that serve as a commentary on the \u201cI\u2019s\u201d\nactions. Mead states, \u201cThe action with reference to the others\ncalls out responses in the individual himself\u2014there is then\nanother \u2018me\u2019 criticizing, approving, and suggesting, and\nconsciously planning, i.e., the reflective self\u201d (SS in SW,\n145). The running current of awareness, then, is not due to the\n\u201cI\u201d being immediately aware of itself. It is due to the\nrunning commentary of the \u201cMe\u201d on the actions of the\n\u201cI.\u201d The \u201cMe\u201d follows the \u201cI\u201d so\nclosely in time that it appears as if the \u201cI\u201d is the\nsource of the \u201crunning current of awareness.\u201d\n\nFreud\u2019s super-ego could be conscious or unconscious. One might\nthink of the \u201cMe\u201d as similar to the conscious super-ego in\nthe commentary that it provides, but one would have to be careful not\nto carry this analogy too far. For Mead, the \u201cMe\u201d arises\nin relationship to systems of behaviors, generalized others, and,\ntherefore, is by definition multiple, although the behaviors of\nvarious \u201cMe\u2019s\u201d can overlap. Further, Freud\u2019s\nmodel assumes a determinism that is not inherent in the relationship\nof the \u201cI\u201d to the \u201cMe.\u201d Not only does the\n\u201cI\u201d initiate novel responses, its new behaviors can become\npart of a \u201cMe.\u201d In other words, \u201cMe\u2019s\u201d\nare not static. They are systems that often undergo transformation.\nThis will become more apparent in the next section when we discuss\nMead\u2019s ideas regarding emergence. In this context it is enough\nto suggest the following: when a ballplayer makes a catch in a manner\nthat has never been made before\u2014that is, makes a play that is\nsignificantly different from prior catches\u2014the new play may\nbecome part of the repertoire of the team\u2019s behaviors. In other\nwords, the play may alter the existing generalized other by modifying\nexisting behavioral patterns. In so doing, it gives rise to a modified\nor new self because the game as a whole has been changed. Once again,\nthis may be easier to see in terms of the transformations that take\nplace in families when new reactions occur as children and adults\ninteract over time. New selves are generated as family systems are\ntransformed.\n5. Sociality, Emergence, and The Philosophy of the Present\n\nWe have seen that the \u201cI\u201d introduces novelty in actions\nand in the interactions between human beings. For Mead, novelty is not\na phenomenon that can be accounted for in terms of human ignorance, as\nit can for a determinist such as Spinoza. In the Spinozistic\nframework, even though everything in nature is determined, as finite\nmodes we must remain ignorant of the totality of causes. In principle,\nhowever, an infinite Mind could predict every event. Mead, following\nin the footsteps of Darwin, argues that novelty is in fact an aspect\nof the natural world, and that there are events that are not only\nunpredictable due to ignorance, but are in principle impossible to\npredict. In the latter category, for example, we find mutations that\nhelp to give rise to new species, as well as the creative responses of\nbaseball players, musicians, composers, dancers, scientists, etc.\n\nIn The Philosophy of the Present\u2014a compilation based on\nthe Carus Lectures delivered in late 1930 in Berkeley\u2014Mead\noutlines his thoughts on nature and time. Mead did not have the\nopportunity to develop his ideas into a book. (He passed away early in\n1931.) In spite of the fact that these lectures were hurriedly written\ndue to obligations that he had as chair of the University of\nChicago\u2019s philosophy department, they contain ideas that\nilluminate his earlier work and indicate the direction of his thought.\nOn the first page of the lectures we are told that \u201creality\nexists in a present\u201d and that we do not live in a Parmenidean\ncosmos (PP, 1). \u201cFor a Parmenidean reality does not exist.\nExistence involves non-existence: it does take place. The world is a\nworld of events\u201d (PP, 1). Our world is one in which change is\nreal and not merely a subjective, perceptual, phenomenon.\n\nIt seems to me that the extreme mathematization of recent science in\nwhich the reality of motion is reduced to equations in which change\ndisappears in an identity, and in which space and time disappear in a\nfour dimensional continuum of indistinguishable events which is\nneither space nor time is a reflection of the treatment of time as\npassage without becoming. (PP, 19)\n\n\nThe universe doesn\u2019t just spin its wheels and offer motion\nwithout real novelty. Part of the impetus behind The Philosophy of\nthe Present was to argue against an interpretation of space-time,\nsuch as Hermann Minkowski\u2019s, which eliminates the truly novel or\nthe emergent. Emergence involves not only biological organisms, but\nmatter and energy; for example, there is a sense in which water can be\nspoken of as emerging from the combination of hydrogen and\n oxygen.[1]\n Nevertheless, biological examples appear best suited to Mead\u2019s\napproach. It\u2019s worth noting at this juncture that Mead had\nalways been keenly interested in science and the scientific method.\nHowever, as a pragmatist, the test of a scientific hypothesis for him\nis whether it can illuminate the world that is there. He\ncertainly was never a positivist.\n\nAs mentioned, Mead is a systemic thinker who speaks of taking the\nperspectives of others and of generalized others. These perspectives\nare not \u201csubjective\u201d for Mead. They are\n\u201cobjective\u201d in the sense that they provide frames of\nreference and shared patterns of behavior for members of communities.\n(This is not to say that every human community has an equally viable\naccount of the natural world. This is in part why we have science for\nMead.) However, it is not only human perspectives that are objective\nfor Mead. While it is true that only human beings share perspectives\nin a manner that allows them to be (self) conscious about the\nperspectives of others, there is an objective reality to non-human\nperspectives. How can a non-human perspective be objective? In order\nto answer this question, a few general remarks about Mead\u2019s\nnotion of \u201cperspective\u201d are in order. First, it is\nimportant to note that perspectives are not primarily visual for Mead.\nThey are ways of speaking about how organisms act and interact in\nenvironments. In the words of David Miller,\n\nAccording to Mead, every perspective is a consequence of an active,\nselecting organism, and no perspective can be built up out of visual\nexperiences alone or out of experiences of the so-called secondary\nqualities. A perspective arises out of a relation of an active,\nselective, percipient event and its environment. It determines the\norder of things in the environment that are selected, and it is in\nnature\u2026. We make distinctions among objects in our environment,\nfinally, through, contact. (Miller 1973, 213)\n\n\nMead has been referred to as a tactile philosopher, as opposed to a\nvisual one, because of the importance of contact experience in his\nthought. Perspectives involve contact and interaction between\norganisms and their environments. For example, a fish living in a\ncertain pond can be thought of as inhabiting an ecosystem. The way in\nwhich it navigates the pond, finds food to eat, captures its food,\netc., can be spoken of as the fish\u2019s perspective on the pond,\nand it is objective, that is, its interactions are not a matter of the\nsubjective perceptions of the fish. Its interactions in its\nenvironment shape and give form to its perspective, which is different\nfrom the snail\u2019s perspective, although it lives in the same\nwaters. In other words, organisms stratify environments in different\nways as they seek to meet their needs (Miller 1973, 207\u2013217).\nThe pond, in fact, is not one system but many systems in the sense\nthat its inhabitants engage in different, interlaced interactions, and\ntherefore have different objective perspectives. The fish, of course,\ndoes not comprehend its perspective or localized environment as a\nsystem, but this doesn\u2019t make its perspective subjective. Human\nbeings, given our capacity to discuss systems in language, can\ndescribe the ecology of a pond (or better, the ecologies of a pond\ndepending on what organisms we are studying). We can describe, with\nvarying degrees of accuracy, what it is like to be a fish living in a\nparticular pond, as opposed to a snail. Through study we learn about\nthe perspectives of other creatures, although we cannot share them as\nwe can the perspectives of the language bearing members of our own\nspecies.\n\nFor Mead, as noted, systems are not static. This is especially evident\nin the biological world. New forms of life arise, and some of them are\ndue to the efforts of human beings, for example, the botanists who\ncreate hybrids. Mead argues that if a new form of life emerges from\nanother form, then there is a time when the new organism has not fully\ndeveloped, and therefore has not yet modified its environmental niche.\nIn this situation the older order, the old environment, has not\ndisappeared but neither has the new one been born. Mead refers to this\nstate of betwixt and between as sociality.\n\nWhen the new form has established its citizenship the botanist can\nexhibit the mutual adjustments that have taken place. The world has\nbecome a different world because of the advent, but to identify\nsociality with this result is to identify it with system merely. It is\nrather the stage betwixt and between the old system and the new one\nthat I am referring to. If emergence is a feature of reality this\nphase of adjustment, which comes between the ordered universe before\nthe emergent has arisen and that after it has come to terms with the\nnewcomer, must be a feature also of reality. (PP, 47)\n\n\nSociality is a key idea for Mead and it has implications for his\nsociology and social psychology. If we think of the \u201cMe\u201d\nas a system, then there are times when the \u201cI\u201d initiates\nnew responses that may or may not be integrated into an existing\n\u201cMe.\u201d But if they come to be integrated, then there is a\ntime betwixt and between the old and new \u201cMe\u201d system. What\nmakes this all the more interesting is that human beings have a\ncapacity for reflection. We can become aware of changes that are\ntaking place as we \u201cstand\u201d betwixt and between, which\nallows for the possibility of influencing the development of a future\nself. We can even set up conditions to promote changes that we believe\nmay transform us in certain ways. Or to put this in another light, new\nproblems are bound to arise in the world, and because of our capacity\nfor sociality, we can get some purchase on the courses of action\navailable to us as we reflect on the novel problems confronting us. Of\ncourse, because the problems are novel means that we do not have ready\nsolutions. However, the capacity to stand betwixt and between old and\n(possible) new orders, as we do between old and new social roles,\nprovides us with some opportunity for anticipating alternatives and\nintegrating new responses. As a matter of fact, Mead links moral\ndevelopment with our capacity for moving beyond old values, old\nselves, in order to integrate new values into our personalities when\nnew situations call for them.\n\nTo leave the field to the values represented by the old self is\nexactly what we term selfishness. The justification for the term is\nfound in the habitual character of conduct with reference to these\nvalues.\u2026Where, however, the problem is objectively considered,\nalthough the conflict is a social one, it should not resolve itself\ninto a struggle between selves, but into such reconstruction of the\nsituation that different and enlarged and more adequate\npersonalities may emerge. (SS in SW, 148) [emphasis added]\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that Mead did not develop an ethics, at\nleast not one that was systematically presented. But his position\nbears a kinship to theorists of moral sentiment, if we understand\n\u201cthe taking the perspectives of others\u201d as a more\nsophisticated statement of sympathetic attachments. It is important to\nemphasize that for pragmatic reasons Mead does not think that the idea\nof compassion is sufficient for grounding an ethics. He argues for a\nnotion of obligation that is tied to transforming social conditions\nthat generate pain and\n suffering.[2]\n\nReturning to Mead\u2019s notion of sociality, we can see that he is\nseeking to emphasize transitions and change between systems. This\nemphasis on change has repercussions for his view of the present,\nwhich is not to be understood as a knife-edge present. In human\nexperience, the present arises from a past and spreads into the\nfuture. In a manner reminiscent of James\u2019s account of the stream\nof thought, Mead argues that the present entails duration (James 1890,\n237\u2013283). It retains the receding past and anticipates the\nimminent future. Yet because reality ultimately exists in the present,\nMead argues that the historical past, insofar as it is capable of\nbeing experienced, is transformed by novel events. History is not\nwritten on an unchanging scroll. Novelty gives lie to this way of\nseeing the past. By virtue of its originality, the novel event, the\nemergent, can not be explained or understood in terms of prior\ninterpretations of the past. The past, which by definition can only\nexist in the present, changes to accommodate novel events.\n\nIt is idle, at least for the purposes of experience, to have recourse\nto a \u201creal\u201d past within which we are making constant\ndiscoveries; for that past must be set over against a present within\nwhich the emergent appears, and the past, which must then be looked at\nfrom the standpoint of the emergent, becomes a different past. The\nemergent when it appears is always found to follow from the past, but\nbefore it appears it does not, by definition, follow from the past.\n(PP, 2)\n\n6. Determinism and Freedom\n\nMead\u2019s account of the \u201cMe\u201d and the generalized other\nhas often led commentators to assume that he is a determinist. It is\ncertainly the case that if one were to emphasize Mead\u2019s concern\nwith social systems and the social development of the self, one might\nbe led to conclude that Mead is a theorist of the processes of\nsocialization. And the latter, nested as they are within social\nsystems, are beyond the control of individuals. However, when one\nconsiders the role of the \u201cI\u201d and novelty in his thinking,\nit becomes more difficult to view him as a determinist. But his\nemphasis on novelty only seems to counter determinism with\nspontaneity. This counter to determinism in itself doesn\u2019t\nsupply a notion of autonomy\u2014self-governance and\nself-determination\u2014which is often viewed as crucial to the\nmodern Western notion of the subject. However, Mead was a firm booster\nof the scientific method, which he viewed as an activity that was at\nits heart democratic. For him, science is tied to the manner in which\nhuman beings have managed from pre-recorded times to solve problems\nand transform their worlds. We have just learned to be more methodical\nabout the ways in which we solve problems in modern science. If one\nconsiders his discussions of science and problem solving behavior,\nwhich entail anticipatory experience, the reflexivity of\nconsciousness, the sharing of perspectives and their objective\nreality, and the creativity of the \u201cI,\u201d then one begins to\nsee how Mead thought that our biological endowments coupled with our\nsocial skills could assist us in shaping our own futures, as well aid\nus in making moral decisions. He did not work out the details of this\nprocess, especially with regard to moral autonomy and the\n\u201cI\u2019s\u201d role in\n it.[3]\n There is, however, little doubt that he thought autonomy possible,\nbut the condition for its possibility depends on the nature of the\nself\u2019s genesis and the type of society in which it develops.\n7. Recent Scholarship and Trends\n\nFor the better part of half a century, a resurgence of interest in\npragmatism has led to a steady production of scholarship on the\nclassical American pragmatists. Countless articles, books, and\nconferences have been dedicated to rediscovering and reinventing the\nideas of Peirce, James, and Dewey. Journals devoted to their work are\navailable in print and online. George Herbert Mead is the curious\nexception. For Mead, no eponymous journals exist. Only a handful of\nphilosophy conferences have been held in his\n honor.[4]\n In comparison to these other pragmatists, the promise of his\ncontributions remains unfulfilled.\n\nMany of the influential pragmatists of our time proudly accept the\ntitle of inheritors and stewards of the thought of Peirce, James, or\nDewey. While many sociologists have taken up Mead\u2019s banner, he\nhas not received comparable treatment in philosophical circles. Early\nreviews of Mead\u2019s posthumous publications appraised him as\ncomparable in genius and stature to Dewey and James (Shalin 2015).\nThese reviewers anticipated Mead\u2019s novel ideas would prompt much\nphilosophical debate (Shalin 2015). But philosophers who thought\nhighly of him were often disappointed. Maurice Natanson (1956, 1)\nwrote of his dissatisfaction with philosophy scholars\u2019 neglect\nof Mead, \u201cThe work of a truly major American philosopher is\ntoday largely unknown, frequently misunderstood where he is known, and\nmore often than not, simply ignored.\u201d Mead remains frequently\nglossed over, even by most scholars of pragmatism. The result has been\na deficit in philosophical Mead scholarship relative to other\nclassical pragmatists. (This, however, is not to say that there\nhasn\u2019t been important work done on Mead, for example,\nHabermas\u2019s Theory of Communicative Action is indebted\nto Mead.) In this section we will highlight promising recent\nscholarship and trends, which may open up avenues for future\nresearch.\n\nSince the posthumous publication of Mind, Self, and Society,\ncommentaries on Mead have often relied heavily on works that he did\nnot publish, with particular emphasis on those lecture notes and\nmanuscripts addressing the genesis and development of the mind and\nself. However, a systematic analysis of Mead\u2019s philosophy\nrequires an assessment of the whole of his work, including work\npublished in his lifetime (Cook 1993, xiii-xiv). A relatively recent\nmethodological trend in Mead scholarship consists of reframing\nMead\u2019s legacy from a philosopher who seldom published to one\nwhose written canon adds up to over 120 items and counting (Carreira\nda Silva 2008, 6; 2011, ix-x; Cook 2013, 95; C\u00f4t\u00e9 2015;\nReck in SW, xiii-lxii; Taylor 2019; Throop and Ward 2007). By\nutilizing writings in which Mead\u2019s authorship is uncontested,\nthese commentators seek to present Mead in a voice closer to his own.\nThis trend in research on the \u201cthe published Mead\u201d has led\nto inventive investigations into Mead\u2019s theories of experience,\nperception, action, emergence, society, the mind, and social\ncognition. Future efforts employing this method have the potential to\nhighlight Mead\u2019s contributions to the philosophies of history,\neducation, politics, and the social sciences.\n\nMead developed an interest in physiology early in his intellectual\ndevelopment, and he certainly saw us as embodied organisms, for whom\nthe sense of touch was uniquely important. But the relationship\nbetween the body and the self has been subject to different\ninterpretations. Some recent studies on Mead have sought to address\nthe constitutive role of bodily awareness in the emergence of mind and\nself, and rethink what is necessary to articulate a unified embodied\nself, given Mead\u2019s distinctions between the \u201cI\u201d and\n\u201cMe\u201d (see, for example, Cook 2013; McVeigh 2020).\nConsequently, two interrelated trajectories in contemporary Mead\nscholarship have emerged: 1) investigations into the possibility of a\npre-reflective self, particularly as it pertains to the constitution\nof a unified self, and 2) situating Mead among social cognition\ntheorists, whereby his philosophy serves as a precursor to what is now\nviewed as the second wave of cognitive science built upon\naction-oriented theories of 4EA cognition (i.e., embedded, embodied,\nenactive, extended, and affective).\n\nSeveral contemporary commentators on Mead assert that within his\ntheory of the origin and development of the self lies an opportunity\n(or a missed opportunity, depending on the degree of criticism) to\naccount for a pre-reflective bodily self-awareness in humans that\npermits a non-linguist, auto-affective, naturalized account of unified\nbodily agency, which precedes the development of the social self\n(Geniusas 2006; Madzia 2015). Madzia (2015, 82) argues that for a\nunifying self (capable of self-reflection) to emerge, we must\npresuppose body ownership, that is, a \u201cprimal\nself-awareness\u201d emanating from a body-mindedness. Similarly,\nwhile invoking Jean-Luc Marion\u2019s phenomenology, Geniusas (2006,\n258) contends that acknowledging a \u201cprimordial\nself-givenness\u201d generated by auto-affection accounts for the\n\u201cmineness of experience\u201d and aids in individuation.\nFurther, he maintains that the concept of auto-affection dissolves the\nproblem of delineating a sharp distinction between Mead\u2019s\n\u201cI\u201d and \u201cMe,\u201d because the self would be able\nto know the \u201cI\u201d directly (Geniusas 2006). These accounts\nare not meant to undermine Mead\u2019s social self but to supplement\nit as a precondition of human role-taking. Such accounts may be viewed\nas addressing the relationship between animal and human intelligence.\nMoreover, Madzia (2013; 2015, 83) argues, incorporating a\n\u201cprimal self-awareness\u201d as a stage in the genesis and\nevolution of the self affords Mead the added benefit of making his\ntheory compatible with pragmatism\u2019s principle of continuity.\nNonetheless, Mead might disagree with these approaches and respond to\nsuch commentaries by restating his commitment to the social\nconstitution of the self: \u201cI do not want to discuss metaphysical\nproblems, but I want to insist that the self has a sort of structure\nthat arises in social conduct that is entirely distinguishable from\nthis so-called subjective experience\u201d (MSS, 166).\n\nTo address Mead\u2019s apparent failure to provide a comprehensive\naccount of a unified self, some scholars have taken a different\ncourse. They have attempted to demonstrate how narrative can play a\nrole in interpreting Mead\u2019s work, for example, by providing the\nresources necessary to harmonize the multiple selves articulated by\nMead (Aboulafia 2016; Jackson 2010). A turn to narrative can be viewed\nas bringing Mead closer to the hermeneutic philosophy of Charles\nTaylor and Paul Ricoeur (see, for instance, Ezzy 1998).\n\nTaking up the second trajectory mentioned above, we find studies in\nwhat has been called the pragmatic turn in second generation cognitive\nscience (Baggio 2021). There are scholars \u2013 for example, Guido\nBaggio (2021), Roman Madzia (2016a, 2016b, 2017), and Ryan McVeigh\n(2016, 2020) \u2013 who view Mead\u2019s philosophy as a forerunner\nto more contemporary physically embodied, socially embedded,\naction-oriented theories of social cognition and\n mind.[5]\n These commentators share the belief that Mead\u2019s interconnected\ntheories of emergence, perception, action, and mind provide fertile\nareas for critical engagement with contemporary studies of enactive,\nextended, and embodied cognition.\n\nMead and second-generation cognitive theorists share a commitment to\nthe evolutionary, genetic, and ultimately social development of\ncognition. Projects in 4EA cognition have the potential to align with,\nor better, respond to Mead\u2019s demand that questions of mind and\nthe self are developed out of an integration of the\n\u201cparallel\u201d disciplines of philosophy, social psychology,\nand physiology (CP in ESP, 9\u201318; see also McVeigh 2016, 2020).\nFor instance, it has been argued that mirror neurons function as the\nneurological mechanism that allows for humans to take the attitude of\nothers (Madzia 2013; McVeigh 2016). Contemporary research in cognitive\nscience that addresses the perspectival nature and embodied sociality\nof such cognitive mechanisms as basic-level cognition and joint\nattention has the potential to complement and enrich Mead\u2019s\nviews on the emergence of self, mind, and society (McVeigh 2016;\nCahoone 2013, 2019; see also Tomasello 2020).\n\nFurther, the importance for Mead of evolutionary processes and contact\nexperience in the genesis and development of the self and mind opens\nthe door to the integration of his philosophy and cognitive science in\nsuch areas as sensorimotor enactivism (Baggio 2021) and the extended\n(Madzia 2013) and embodied mind (McVeigh 2020; Madzia 2016). Notably,\nthe primacy of the hand\u2019s role in Mead\u2019s theory of\nperception lends itself to current cognitive accounts of the embodied\nmind and the development of human intelligence and culture (Madzia\n2017).\n\nWe now transition from the philosophy of mind to the impact of\nMead\u2019s work in social and political philosophy, and its\nrelationship to Hegel. Mead\u2019s early Hegelianism has been aptly\nnoted (Cook 1993, 37\u201347; Joas 1985). Although there are scholars\nwho argue that Mead shed his Hegelian roots, others recommend that\nMead\u2019s mature work be read in light of Hegel (Aboulafia 2010).\nRecently, while continuing the methodological project of a systematic\nreading of \u201cthe published Mead,\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 (2015) presents a critical reconstruction of\nMead\u2019s concept of society by advancing a genealogical account of\nMead\u2019s lifelong engagement with Hegelian themes. Here, the\ncogenesis and indefinite co-restructuring of a self-aware society and\nselfhood, in its ontogenetic and phylogenetic manifestations,\nrepresent a marriage between Darwin\u2019s evolutionary processes and\nHegel\u2019s dialectics. C\u00f4t\u00e9 (2015) asserts that for\nMead, modern mass democracy \u2013characterized by the political\nreforms of his time and the development of what Mead calls\n\u201cinternational-mindedness\u201d \u2013 has produced a\nself-aware and self-transformative global society. C\u00f4t\u00e9\n(2015, 181) notes, however, that the promise of a cosmopolitan society\ndoes not end in mere \u201cglobalization.\u201d Indebted to the\nthought of Mead, Aboulafia\u2019s (2010) most recent book examines\nself-determination and cosmopolitanism. Among other topics, he\nexplores the ways in which the social self and a form of transcendence\nrelate to self-determination and the fashioning of a cosmopolitan\nsensibility that is sensitive to the experiences of different groups\nand peoples. Aboulafia\u2019s and C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s projects\noffer opportunities to develop a Mead-inspired political theory that\nemphasizes the transformative efforts of individuals and\ninstitutions.\n\nOver the years comparative analyses of Mead have brought him into\nconversation with analytic philosophers such as Wittgenstein, Sellars,\nQuine, and Davidson (Baggio 2016a, 2019, 2020; Madzia 2013c), the\nContinental thought of Habermas and Arendt (Aboulafia 2001),\nphenomenologists such as Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Levinas,\nand Marion (Aboulafia 1986, 2001; Geniusas 2006; Jung 1995; Rosenthal\nand Bourgeois 1991), the philosophic hermeneutics and expressivism of\nCharles Taylor (Abbott 2020; Fietz 2021), the developmental\npsychologist, linguist, and cognitive scientist Michael Tomasello\n(Cahoone 2013, 2019; McVeigh 2016; Nungesser 2016; Tomasello 2020),\neconomic thought, particularly Veblen and Sen (Baggio 2016a, 2016b,\n2017; Betz 2013; Green 2013), animal studies (Booth 2016b; Gallagher\n2016), and psychoanalytic theory (C\u00f4t\u00e9 2015; Santarelli\n2013). Research in pragmatist feminism has revealed the influence of\nMead on philosopher, educator, and activist Grace Lee Boggs\n(previously Grace Chin Lee), whose dissertation and first book\npresented an early critical introduction to Mead\u2019s social\nphilosophy (Lee 1945; Lake 2020; Varner 2021; see also Huebner 2022,\n20).\n\nOf interest, also, are those studies in philosophical hermeneutics\nplacing Mead in the tradition of Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer\n(C\u00f4t\u00e9 2021; Jung 1995; Taylor 2019). In recognizing the\nearly influence of Dilthey on Mead while a student in Berlin, we can\nbegin to see how and where their interrelated interests developed\nsimilarities and differences, particularly as they relate to the\nnatural and social sciences. Returning to their student-teacher\nrelationship serves as a springboard for contemporary philosophical\ndebates regarding the primacy of experience and life-processes, the\nsignificance of historical situatedness, and the overcoming of the\ntraditional separation of theory and praxis (Jung 1995).\n\nLastly, we arrive at Mead\u2019s philosophy of education. Before all\nelse, Mead was an educator. A \u201cstimulating\u201d orator, James\nH. Tufts tells us, for Mead, \u201cthe lecture was his medium\u201d\n(Huebner 2015, 85). He offered courses in a variety of disciplines\nthat spanned the history of thought. Prior to holding appointments at\nthe Universities of Michigan and Chicago, he tried his hand as a\ngrade-school teacher (Cook\n 1993).[6]\n For Mead, the learner does not merely receive meaning, she\nindustriously incorporates and transforms it. For this reason, he was\nactively involved in Dewey\u2019s innovative Laboratory School. For\nmany years he served as editor and contributor to the educational\njournals School Review and Elementary School\nTeacher, and publicly spoke on, and published in various other\nmediums shorter contributions to, the philosophy of education,\npedagogy, and educational psychology.\n\nIt is often argued that Mead was so consumed by his civic commitment\nto educational reform in Chicago that he spent little attention to\npublishing his ideas. Even more important, then, that it is known that\nhis longest published piece in his lifetime was A Report on\nVocational Training in Chicago and in other Cities, a 1912\ncoauthored book-length study for the City Club of Chicago comparing\npractices of vocational education across cities. In opposition to\nsegregating trade schools from traditional scholastic programs, he\nadvocated for practical vocational education as standard in the\ncurriculum of public education (Huebner 2022, 12). Further, Mead had\nintended to publish a book of collected short works, titled Essays\non Psychology (see ESP, xii). Of the 18 chapters, 10 had\neducation as their topic. Moreover, between the years 1905 and 1911,\nMead offered four courses on the philosophy of education at the\nUniversity of Chicago (PE, 3). Recognizing the vital importance of\neducation in Mead\u2019s social philosophy, Alfred Stafford Clayton\n(1943) published what remains the sole book-length investigation into\nMead\u2019s philosophy of\n education.[7]\n Not until 2008 were the lecture notes on Mead\u2019s philosophy of\neducation course made available to the public (PE, 2011). Prior to\nthis publication, only a few important studies were made on\nMead\u2019s contribution to educational theory (Barnes 2002; Biesta\n1998, 1999; Deegan 1999; Martin 2007b). Since then, little has been\nadded to this important discussion.\n\nThroughout his writings, Mead often referred to the gradual\ndevelopment of a \u201cscientific attitude\u201d in social selves\nand their society as a \u201cgreat,\u201d even \u201csplendid\nsecular adventure\u201d (MT, 63, 85; SM in SW, 265\u2013266).\nPerhaps recent trends in Mead scholarship will further clarify why he\nwas so sanguine about this secular adventure.\n",
