In particular, knowledge and justification do not\npass from premises to conclusion if we become aware of an\nup\u0101dhi, an \u201cadditional condition,\u201d which\nwould be a blocker of \u201creflection\u201d through undermining the\ngeneralization on which such reflection depends. Thus awareness of an\nup\u0101dhi is a preventer of inferential knowledge, a\n\u201cdefeater,\u201d leading to belief relinquishment by someone\nwho has hitherto not noticed the condition and who has erroneously\narrived at a conclusion on the basis of a falsely induced,\npseudo-pervasion. A rough (and non-classical) example: I know that Al\nhas a temper that will flare up in certain circumstances from having\nwitnessed many tantrums such that I expect that Al will explode by\nmaking an inference when I see that the circumstances obtain, but\nhaving overlooked that it is only with Belle that Al is so irascible\nand Belle not being present in the circumstances where I expect, by\npseudo-inference, Al\u2019s temper to flare, Belle would be the\nup\u0101dhi, the \u201cadditional condition.\u201d\nDiscussion of the concept occupies more than a tenth of\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s long inference chapter.\n\nThe up\u0101dhi (\\(U\\)) has a negative character, serving, at\nleast in the first place, to undermine a putative inferential\nconclusion by showing that the pervasion\u2014all \\(H\\) as \\(S\\), a\nprover (\\(H\\)) as pervaded by a probandum (\\(S\\))\u2014on which it\ndepends does not hold. But an up\u0101dhi may also serve as\npositive restorer of knowledge in that when it occurs together\nwith an original prover (\\(H\\)) that it undercuts (thus \\(H \\\n\\&\\ U\\)), the inferential conclusion is reestablished.\n\nAccording to a traditional definition which, although refined by\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, suits most purposes, an up\u0101dhi is a\nproperty \\(U\\) such that\n\n\\(U\\) pervades the probandum, the s\u0101dhya, \\(S\\)\n(i.e., anything that is an \\(S\\) is a \\(U\\),\ns\u0101dhya-vy\u0101paka): \\(\\forall x (Sx \\to Ux)\\)\n\\(U\\) does not pervade the prover, the s\u0101dhana or\nhetu, \\(H\\) (i.e., there is something that is an \\(H\\) but\nnot a \\(U\\), s\u0101dhana-avy\u0101paka): \\(\\exists x(Hx \\\n\\&\\ \\neg Ux)\\)\n\n\nIt follows then that there is \u201cdeviation\u201d (the prover is\nsaid to \u201cdeviate,\u201d being somewhere the probandum is not)\nand no relation of pervasion.\n\n\\(\\exists x(Hx \\ \\&\\ \\neg Sx)\\)\n\n\nThere are lots of other fallacies that Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba discusses.\nThe Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra lists five\n\u201cpseudo-provers,\u201d hetv-\u0101bh\u0101sa, which\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba examines at length:\n\n\u201cDeviation,\u201d in three varieties:\n\n\nthe \u201ccommon,\u201d which is knowledge of a counterexample\n(\\(Hb, \\neg Sb\\))\nthe \u201cunique,\u201d defined as a putative prover\u2019s not\nbeing known to occur in places where the probandum is known to occur\nor not to occur (for example, the \u201cprover,\u201d being-sound,\nwith respect to an inferential subject, sound, since only sound has\nthe universal being-a-sound which then cannot prove anything)\nthe \u201cinconclusive,\u201d where the property specifying the\ninferential subject is universally locatable such that there can be no\nevidence outside it (nothing is outside it) without begging the\nquestion (thus, with a few exceptions, no inference beginning\n\u201cEverything is \\(F\\) (momentary, material, etc.)\u201d\nis acceptable since nothing could count as evidence if the inferential\nsubject is everything)\n\nthe \u201ccontradictory,\u201d where \\(Ha\\) proves the absence\nof a putative probandum, i.e., \\(\\neg Sa\\)\n\u201ccounterinference,\u201d which is a putative prover that\nwould establish a conclusion \\(Sa\\) except that its evidence base\nconsisting of correlations, positive and negative, between things\n\\(H\\) and \\(S\\), is matched by an opponent's inference to \\(\\neg Sa\\)\ncomplete with correlations between a counterprover \\(J\\) and \\(\\neg\nS\\) (this fallacy reveals a social dimension to knowledge)\nthe \u201cunestablished,\u201d which Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba views as\nthree separate fallacies:\n\n\na putative prover as unestablished with respect to location or\nproperty-bearer, e.g., \\(Ha\\)?\nits being unestablished with respect to essential nature (e.g.,\n\u201cThe lake is fiery since it is smokey\u201d)\nthe unestablished by way of not being pervaded by the probandum\n(said not to be a separate fallacy but reducing to deviation, the\ncontradictory, or the defeated)\n\nthe \u201cdefeated,\u201d the \u201cdefeated in advance,\u201d\nas it were, a kind of \u201cpatent falsehood.\u201d\n\n\nThese \u201cflaws of the prover,\u201d hetu-do\u1e63a, are\nalso called \u201cconstant flaws,\u201d nitya-do\u1e63a,\nas opposed to puru\u1e63a-do\u1e63a, \u201cflaws of a\nperson,\u201d which are anitya-do\u1e63a, \u201coccasional\nflaws.\u201d Admittedly, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba contends that sometimes\neven \u201cfailure to grasp a pervasion is (not a logical flaw but) a\nflaw belonging to a person or subject\u201d (2020: 884).\nNevertheless, the five pseudo-provers are separated out from other\ndefeaters called clinchers from the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra on,\nbecause they highlight logical\u2014or in the case of (3)\nepistemological\u2014rules as opposed to personal failures such as\nfailing to pay attention. The up\u0101dhi fallacy, too,\nentails a counterexample and so is a \u201cconstant flaw,\u201d\nalthough failure to notice one on occasion can be a personal\nerror.\n\nTwo further types of defeater or pseudo-defeater identified in the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra are, first, j\u0101ti,\n\u201cfalse analogies,\u201d which seem dismissed by\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba (in the voice of an opponent) saying that they are\nnot good responses in a debate or controversy (2020: 949), in contrast\nwith, second, \u201cclinchers,\u201d nigraha-sth\u0101na,\nwhose importance in debate is acknowledged but not in any detail taken\nup (perhaps Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba sees the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra\u2019s list, as explained by\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana, as satisfactory). But j\u0101ti are\ndismissed because, it seems, however they may have been conceived in\nearly years (Prets 2001), long before Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba they come to\nbe understood as misleading analogies and classified as\ntricks of debate or philosophic conundra, not really worthy\nof inquiry. A j\u0101ti is a pseudo-defeater in the broad\nsense of a misleading analogy, and there is less agreement about them\nacross school than about pseudo-provers, clinchers, and, we must add,\ntypes of tarka, \u201chypothetical reasoning,\u201d which\nwere reviewed above.\n",
