Should Everyone Receive Equal Voting Rights?\n\nThe dominant view among political philosophers is that we ought to\nhave some sort of representative democracy, and that each adult ought\nto have one vote, of equal weight to every other adult\u2019s, in any\nelection in her jurisdiction. This view has recently come under\ncriticism, though, both from friends and foes of democracy.\n\nBefore one even asks whether \u201cone person, one vote\u201d is the\nright policy, one needs to determine just who counts as part of the\ndemos. Call this the boundary problem or the problem of constituting\nthe demos (Goodin 2007: 40; Ron 2017). Democracy is the rule of the\npeople. But one fundamental question is just who constitutes\n\u201cthe people\u201d. This is no small problem. Before one can\njudge that a democracy is fair, or adequately responds to\ncitizens\u2019 interests, one needs to know who \u201ccounts\u201d\nand who does not.\n\nOne might be inclined to say that everyone living under a particular\ngovernment\u2019s jurisdiction is part of the demos and is thus\nentitled to a vote. However, in fact, most democracies exclude\nchildren and teenagers, felons, the mentally infirm, and non-citizens\nliving in a government\u2019s territory from being able to vote, but\nat the same time allow their citizens living in foreign countries to\nvote (L\u00f3pez-Guerra 2014: 1).\n\nThere are a number of competing theories here. The \u201call affected\ninterests\u201d theory (Dahl 1990a: 64) holds that anyone who is\naffected by a political decision or a political institution is part of\nthe demos. The basic argument is that anyone who is affected by a\npolitical decision-making process should have some say over that\nprocess. However, this principle suffers from multiple problems. It\nmay be incoherent or useless, as we might not know or be able to know\nwho is affected by a decision until after the decision is made (Goodin\n2007: 52). For example (taken from Goodin 2007: 53), suppose the UK\nvotes on whether to transfer 5% of its GDP to its former African\ncolonies. We cannot assess whether the members of the former African\ncolonies are among the affected interests until we know what the\noutcome of the vote is. If the vote is yay, then they are affected; if\nthe vote is nay, then they are not. (See Owen 2012 for a response.)\nFurther, the \u201call affected interests\u201d theory would often\ninclude non-citizens and exclude citizens. Sometimes political\ndecisions made in one country have a significant effect on citizens of\nanother country; sometimes political decisions made in one country\nhave little or no effect on some of the citizens of that country.\n\nOne solution (Goodin 2007: 55) to this problem (of who counts as an\naffected party) is to hold that all people with possibly or\npotentially affected interests constitute part of the polity.\nThis principle implies, however, that for many decisions, the demos is\nsmaller than the nation-state, and for others, it is larger. For\ninstance, when the United States decides whether to elect a\nwarmongering or pacifist candidate, this affects not only Americans,\nbut a large percentage of people worldwide.\n\nOther major theories offered as solutions to the boundary problem face\nsimilar problems. For example, the coercion theory holds that anyone\nsubject to coercion from a political body ought to have a say\n(L\u00f3pez-Guerra 2005). But this principle might be also be seen\nas over-inclusive (Song 2009), as it would require that resident\naliens, tourists, or even enemy combatants be granted a right to vote,\nas they are also subject to a state\u2019s coercive power. Further,\nwho will be coerced depends on the outcome of a decision. If a state\ndecides to impose some laws, it will coerce certain people, and if the\nstate declines to impose those laws, then it will not. If we try to\novercome this by saying anyone potentially subject to a given\nstate\u2019s coercive power ought to have a say, then this seems to\nimply that almost everyone worldwide should have a say in most\nstates\u2019 major decisions.\n\nThe commonsense view of the demos, i.e., that the demos includes all\nand only adult members of a nation-state, may be hard to defend.\nGoodin (2007: 49) proposes that what makes citizens special is that\ntheir interests are interlinked. This may be an accidental feature of\narbitrarily-decided national borders, but once these borders are in\nplace, citizens will find that their interests tend to more linked\ntogether than with citizens of other polities. But whether this is\ntrue is also highly contingent.\n",
