    "main_text": "\n\nPleasure, in the inclusive usages important in thought about\nwell-being, experience, and mind, includes the affective positivity of\nall joy, gladness, liking, and enjoyment\u00a0\u2013 all our feeling\ngood or happy. It is often contrasted with the similarly inclusive\npain, or suffering, of all our feeling\n bad.[1]\n Nowadays\n \u201chappiness\u201d\n is often used similarly, which leads to confusion with older uses\nsignifying overall good fortune or success in life that figure in\nself-reports of happiness and in \u2018happiness studies\u2019 of\nthe diverse sources of these.\n\nPleasure presents as good and attractive\u00a0\u2013 itself, when it\ncomes to our notice, and all else that appears aglow in its light.\nThis suggests simple explanations both of why people pursue pleasure\nand why there are reasons to do so. That we may prefer and choose\nsomething for its pleasure suggests that there are facts about\npleasure that make some such choices better than others. Philosophers,\ntaking this suggestion further, have sometimes taken pleasure to be a\nsingle simple (feature of) experience that makes\nexperiences good and attractive to the extent it is present.\nThis simple picture has often been associated with more\nsweeping normative and psychological claims, all ambiguously called\n \u201chedonism\u201d.\n These take pleasure\u2019s goodness and attractiveness (and\npain\u2019s badness and aversiveness) to (between them) explain\nall of human value, normative practical reasons, and\nmotivation. Pleasure and pain would, if views of all three\nkinds were true, be the only ultimately good- and bad-making\nfeatures of human (and relevantly similar animal) life and also\nboth the only actual ultimate ends and the only justified\nultimate ends of all our voluntary pursuit and avoidance. The\nsimple picture and related hedonistic claims and explanations were\nespecially prominent in the psychology, economics, and philosophy of\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries but were widely rejected in\nthe twentieth.\n\nContemporary science partly restores pleasure\u2019s importance but\nalso suggests that pleasure\u2019s relations to awareness and\nmotivational attraction are more variable than many hedonists and much\nordinary thinking supposed. Contemporary philosophers continue to\ndebate what pleasure is but are only beginning to address scientific\nadvances that are slowly filling out what age-old use of psychoactive\nsubstances to enhance mood and newer drug therapies for depression\nalready presupposed\u00a0\u2013 pleasure is a biological\nphenomenon.\n\nGuide to the Contents: Notes should be omitted by the\ntypical reader; see the advice that precedes these. \u00a71 discusses\nthe simple picture (boldface, two paragraphs above). \u00a71.3\nsuggests how the objections earlier considered may be mitigated\nsufficiently to save the simple picture\u2019s experiential core as a\nlive theoretical possibility. The difficulty and fallibility of\nintrospection and perhaps especially of introspecting affective states\nis appealed to. \u00a72.3.2 discusses the recent attitudinal approach\nin the form developed by Fred Feldman. Its difficulties are discussed\nat length and both neoAristotelian and more simple-picture-like\nalternatives (\u00a72.3.3) suggested. More complex medieval accounts\nof pleasure\u2019s intentional relations are also noted (\u00a72.3.1)\nand likewise contrasted with more nondual views. \u00a73, especially,\naims to integrate philosophical and scientific, historical and\ncontemporary contributions.\n",
