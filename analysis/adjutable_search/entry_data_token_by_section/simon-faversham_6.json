    "main_text": "Psychology || Metaphysics of the Intellect\n4.2 Metaphysics of the Intellect\n\nAccording to Simon, the intellect is the faculty of the rational soul\nwhereby it thinks. Simon, who follows the Aristotelian doctrine\nclosely, holds this faculty to be immaterial, passive, and separate.\nIt is separate because it does not need to use an organ in order to\nperform its operation of intellection. It is also passive, but not in\nthe same sense matter is passive. In fact, there are two senses in\nwhich something is passive: it can receive forms with or without\nundergoing qualitative change. Like matter, the intellect receives\nforms because it needs an intelligible object on which to perform its\nproper operation. But matter is passive in a further and more\nfundamental sense: when brought to act by a form, it suffers\nqualitative change. The intellect, however, does not suffer\nqualitative change, but is simply actualized. Accordingly, the\nintellect is passive simply because it is potential with respect to\nthe act of intellection. And precisely because it does not suffer\nqualitative change when it is brought to act, the intellect is also\nsaid to be immaterial.\n\nThe intellectual faculty, i.e., the intellect, comprises a passive\ncapacity\u2014the possible intellect\u2014and an active\ncapacity\u2014the agent intellect, which is the intrinsic active\nprinciple of the act of intellection (In De an.: q.13). The\nproper operation of the passive capacity is apprehension, i.e., the\nassimilation of quiddities through the reception of intelligible\nforms. In turn, the proper operation of the active capacity is\nabstraction, i.e., the production of intelligible forms which trigger\nthe operation of the possible intellect (In De an.:\nq.13).\n",
