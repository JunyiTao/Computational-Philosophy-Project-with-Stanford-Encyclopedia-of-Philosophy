    "main_text": "Self-Location in Language || Alternative models of communication\n5.3 Alternative models of communication\n\nThe literature offers many responses to the failure of self-locating\ndoxastic states to play nicely with a package-delivery model of\ncommunication. We won\u2019t attempt to survey them in detail here.\nInstead, we\u2019ll present a taxonomy of response-types. The\nresponses fall into three main categories: recentering,\ndecentering, and restriction. (There is a fourth\noption\u2014multicentering\u2014which we will discuss only\nbriefly, because its distinctive claims and contributions are in its\naccount of the linguistic mediation between speakers\u2019 and\naddressees\u2019 attitudes. As far as what it says about\nspeakers\u2019 and addressees\u2019 attitudes themselves, it\u2019s\na version of a recentering account. More about this below.)\n\nThis literature typically frames its questions and proposals in a\nLewisian framework. But it\u2019s worth emphasizing that the issue of\ncommunicating self-locating beliefs doesn\u2019t arise only for the\nLewisian. So we will continue to characterize candidate responses in\nLewis/Perry neutral terms. For points of entry into the literature,\nsee Heim 2004\n (Other Internet Resources);\n Egan 2007; Feit 2008; Moss 2012; Kindermann 2016; Stojanovic 2012;\nK\u00f6lbel 2013; the papers in Garc\u00eda-Carpintero and Torre\n2016; Torre 2010; and Ninan 2010b.\n\nThe first move we\u2019ll discuss is recentering (the first\nuse of that term we can locate is in Weber 2013). The idea is that\nsuccessful communication doesn\u2019t require transmission of a\nsingle doxastic state from speaker to addressee. The doxastic state\nthat motivates sincere assertion needn\u2019t be the same as the\ndoxastic state adopted as a result of credulous uptake. What\u2019s\nexpressed is what the speaker believes, but what the hearer comes to\nbelieve as a result of accepting the assertion is something else. In\ncredulous, trusting uptake, the addressee doesn\u2019t (more\ncarefully\u2014needn\u2019t) come to adopt the doxastic state\nexpressed by the speaker\u2019s sincere assertion, but instead\nrecenters, adopting a doxastic state that stands in a\nparticular relation to the doxastic state of the speaker, reflecting\nthe addressee\u2019s beliefs about how they and the speaker are\nrelated to one another.\n\nSo, for example, when Andy says to Mike, \u201cmy pants are on\nfire\u201d, Andy believes (for example) the interesting de\nse proposition corresponding to the property, having burning\npants. Mike, when he accepts Andy\u2019s assertion,\ndoesn\u2019t come to believe what Andy believes. Mike instead comes\nto believe a \u201cre-centered\u201d relative of what Andy\nbelieves\u2014the interesting de se proposition\ncorresponding to the property of (for example), being addressed by\nsomeone with burning pants. Andy says what he says because he is\nin the \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d doxastic state, and wants to\nmake it the case that Mike is in an appropriately matching state. The\nappropriately matching state that Mike, as a credulous addressee,\ncomes to be in is not the very same state Andy is in, but something\nelse\u2014for example, the \u201cthe guy who just addressed\nme\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d doxastic state.\n\nHow exactly does linguistic communication produce these properly\naligned doxastic states? Multiple proposals are available; we\u2019ll\npause for a moment to discuss multicentering accounts. In\nmulticentering models, self-locating communication is\ncharacterized by means of multicentered contents\u2014sets\nof n-tuples, each of which contains a world, a time, and a\nseries of individuals. We can characterize the content of\nAndy\u2019s communication to Mike with a set of triples \\(\\langle\nw,t,\\langle i_1,i_2\\rangle \\rangle\\) such that, in \\(w\\) at \\(t\\),\n\\(i_1\\) is addressing \\(i_2\\), and \\(i_1\\)\u2019s pants are on fire.\nIf Andy had instead said, \u201cyou are better at basketball than\nme\u201d, we could model the content with the set of \\(\\langle\nw,t,\\langle i_1,i_2\\rangle \\rangle\\)s such that, at \\(t\\) in \\(w\\),\n\\(i_2\\) is better at basketball than \\(i_1\\). The intuitive idea is\nthat we characterize communicated content (and conversational common\nground) using sets of set-theoretic objects whose role is to\nrepresent, not a single individual, but an entire conversational\ngroup. They do this by containing, for each participant in the\nconversation, an element representing that particular conversational\nparticipant. These objects characterize the state of the whole\nconversation, and the effects that utterances have on the state of the\nconversation. They don\u2019t directly characterize the cognitive\nattitudes of particular parties to the conversation\u2014a set of\nmulticentered worlds is not a good candidate to be an object of belief\nfor an individual (though see Ninan 2012b for a different application\nof the multicentering apparatus to represent de re\nattitudes). Instead there is a translation from the single set of\nmulticentered worlds characterizing the state of the conversation to\nthe various different sets of singly-centered worlds characterizing\nthe doxastic states of particular parties to the conversation. (When\nthe conversation is properly characterized by a set of \\(\\langle\nw,t,\\langle i_1,i_2\\rangle \\rangle\\)s such that, in \\(w\\) at \\(t\\),\n\\(i_2\\) is better at basketball than \\(i_1\\), and we\u2019re using\nthe first individual position to represent Andy and the second to\nrepresent Mike, that will mean that Andy self-attributes being the\nworse basketball player in a two-person conversation, and Mike\nself-attributes being the better basketball player in a two-person\nconversation.)\n\nWhat\u2019s important for our purposes here is that multicentering\naccounts describe, in an elegant and compact way, the interlocking\npattern of distinct but systematically related doxastic states of the\nparticular parties to the conversation. Each party to the conversation\nhas their own private doxastic states, which are properly\ncharacterized in terms of singly-centered propositions. And in cases\nof successful communication, the sincere speaker and credulous\naddressee wind up, not in the same doxastic state, but in doxastic\nstates systematically related to each other, in ways that the\nmulticentering account is designed to represent. So for our present,\nlimited purposes\u2014where we are concerned just with the relations\nbetween the doxastic states of speakers and addressees in successful\ncommunication, and are averting our eyes from the details of\nlinguistic mechanisms that underwrite that communication and take us\nfrom the one to the other, and also from tools that characterize the\noverall state of a conversation rather than just the doxastic states\nof participants\u2014a multicentering account becomes a way of\nimplementing a recentering account. (There is a lot more to\nsay about this. See for example Stalnaker 2008, 2014; Torre 2010;\nNinan 2010b, 2012a, 2013; and Kindermann 2012, 2016.)\n\nOn decentering models, we retain the package-delivery model\nof communication, but disallow interestingly self-locating doxastic\nstates as deliverable objects. The doxastic states linguistically\ncommunicated are all boring doxastic states. This allows us\nto retain the package-delivery model of communication.\n\nYet the decenterer acknowledges that there are systematic relations\nbetween interestingly self-locating doxastic states and boring\ndoxastic states, for both speakers and hearers. The decenterer uses\nthese connections to explain self-locating communicative effects. On\none way of implementing a decentering model, when Andy says to Mike,\n\u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d, Andy expresses the\n\u201cAndy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d doxastic state. (Other\nimplementations will differ with respect to just which boring doxastic\nstate is expressed.) And that\u2019s the doxastic state that Mike\nwinds up in as well. But being in the boring \u201cAndy\u2019s pants\nare on fire\u201d doxastic state is differently connected to\ninteresting doxastic states for Andy than for Mike. For Andy, given\nhis total package of self-locating beliefs, being in the\n\u201cAndy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d state goes hand in hand\nwith being in the \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d state. For Mike,\ngiven his total package of self-locating beliefs, being in the\n\u201cAndy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d state goes hand in hand\nnot with the \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d state, but with the\n\u201cthe guy I\u2019m talking to\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d\nstate.\n\nSo while what travels (what\u2019s expressed, what\u2019s\ncommunicated) is the boring state, being in that boring state goes\nalong with being in a particular interestingly self-locating state for\nthe speaker, and with a different interestingly self-locating state\nfor the addressee. Moss (2012), working in a Lewisian framework, puts\nit this way: a de se belief is, always, for any particular\nbeliever, going to be \u201cequivalent given certainties\u201d to\nsome de dicto belief of theirs. (In the present framework,\nde se beliefs play the role of interestingly self-locating\ndoxastic states, and de dicto beliefs the role of boring\ndoxastic states.) What travels in communication is the de\ndicto belief, which is liable to be equivalent given certainties\nto one de se belief for speaker, and another for addressee.\nNote that this requires that there\u2019s always, for every believer\nand every de se belief, a de dicto proxy belief\navailable that\u2019s equivalent to that de se belief for\nthat speaker, given what the speaker is certain of. All decenterers\nmust take on something like this substantive commitment to get their\nprogram off the ground (see Stalnaker 2008 and Moss 2012 for details).\nStalnaker (2008) concedes that this approach requires countenancing\nhaecceties (see entry on\n haecceitism),\n which not everyone will be comfortable with. (See also Weber 2015;\nPagin 2016; and Torre 2018 for criticism of the commitment to the\navailability of non-self-locating proxies.)\n\nThe general decentering strategy is to take self-locating attitudes\nout of the story about communication, and put them in the story about\nrelations between what\u2019s communicated and the\ninterlocutors\u2019 private belief-states. Everybody allows, and\nneeds to allow, that speakers and hearers have their own proprietary\ndoxastic states. And everybody allows, and needs to allow, that which\ndoxastic commitments a speaker displays in asserting what they\nbelieve, and which other doxastic commitments a hearer incurs by\naccepting what\u2019s asserted, are going to be highly\ninterpersonally variable. (If you and I are acquainted with different\nmembers of this term\u2019s introduction to philosophy class, which\nde re beliefs we\u2019re committed to when we both accept\nthat every member of the class passed the exam is going to be\ndifferent.) The decenterer solves the problem of self-locating\nbeliefs\u2019 making trouble for the package-delivery model by making\nself-locating beliefs ineligible for (direct) communication, then\nexplaining self-locating communicative effects via uncentered\ncommunication\u2019s knock-on effects for interlocutors\u2019\nprivate self-locating beliefs.\n\nWe\u2019ll call the third response-type restriction.\nRestriction approaches preserve the package-delivery model, but\ndon\u2019t uniformly disallow interestingly self-locating doxastic\nstates as objects of communication. Restrictionists take the fact that\nassertions of \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d don\u2019t lead to\ncredulous addressees getting into the \u201cmy pants are on\nfire\u201d doxastic state to be a reason to think that the English\nsentence doesn\u2019t conventionally communicate the self-locating\ndoxastic state. But they don\u2019t go on to impose a blanket ban on\nself-locating doxastic states as objects of communication, and they\nallow that other sentences might conventionally encode other\nself-locating doxastic states as objects of package-delivery-model\ncommunication. So while the \u201cI am Mike Titelbaum\u201d and\n\u201cI am the greatest\u201d doxastic states are more-or-less\nuniformly disastrous as objects of package-delivery communication,\npackage-delivery communication of the \u201cwe are in\nAmsterdam\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s getting hot in here\u201d, and\n\u201cthat\u2019s Gilmore Lake\u201d states, for example, would\nquite frequently be unproblematic, and even quite useful.\n\nRestriction models aim to rule out, not self-locating doxastic states\ngenerally, but only the troublemaking ones, as objects of\ncommunication. They retain the package-delivery model, but say that\nsome of a speakers\u2019 doxastic states are bad candidates for\nlinguistic communication.\n\nRestrictionists take on two central commitments: First, we\nshouldn\u2019t expect to find natural language devices for\ncommunicating self-locating doxastic states that are systematically\ntroublemaking (such as the \u201cI am David Hume\u201d state).\nSecond, we should expect to see a distinctive sort of conversational\ndefectiveness in assertions of self-locating contents that are locally\ntroublemaking (Egan 2007, 2010).\n\nFor example: Doxastic states such as the \u201cI am the\nspeaker\u201d state or the \u201cI am fifty years old\u201d state\nare extremely likely to be troublemaking if asserted on a\npackage-delivery model, because it\u2019s extremely likely that not\nall the participants in a conversation will believe truly by being in\nthem. The fact that the speaker has the property one must have in\norder to believe truly by being in those doxastic states is not\nstrongly correlated with the speaker\u2019s addressees having it, and\nso it\u2019s very likely that if these states were communicated by\npackage delivery, a package would get delivered that the recipient\nought not to accept.\n\nHowever, doxastic states such as the \u201cwe are in\nAmsterdam\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s getting hot in here\u201d, or\n\u201cthat\u2019s Gilmore Lake\u201d states are less likely to be\ntroublemaking. That\u2019s because participants in a conversation are\nfrequently (though not so frequently as at earlier points in human\ntechnological history) geographically very close to each other,\nexperiencing similar environmental conditions, and attending to the\nsame geographical features.\n\nSo package-delivery transmissions of the \u201cI am the\nspeaker\u201d, \u201cI am fifty years old\u201d, etc. doxastic\nstates should be problematic, and we shouldn\u2019t expect to see\nthem very often, we shouldn\u2019t expect to see natural language\nconstructions that are in the business of expressing them, and we\nshould expect them to be marked as defective on any occasions where\nthey do take place. Package-delivery transmissions of the \u201cwe\nare in Amsterdam\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s getting hot in\nhere\u201d doxastic states, on the other hand, shouldn\u2019t be (or\nshouldn\u2019t systematically be) problematic. And so we should (says\nthe restrictionist) be open to the possibility of natural language\nconstructions conventionally expressing them, and we should expect any\nsuch constructions to display a distinctive sort of defectiveness in\nthe (not-super-frequent) situations when the speaker and their\naudience are different in the relevant respect. (Other kinds of\nself-locating doxastic states that have been suggested as objects of\npackage-delivery communication by recenterers include the \u201cthat\ntastes good to me\u201d state and the \u201cI don\u2019t have\nevidence that rules out rain\u201d state. See Egan 2007 and\n2010\u2014though he doesn\u2019t quite describe things in these\nterms.)\n\nConcluding this section on self-location in language: Self-locating\nbeliefs introduce complications in accounts of belief reporting.\n(Similarly for other attitudes and reports thereof.) Also, some\nself-locating communicative phenomena need to be accounted for in our\nphilosophy of language. Those won\u2019t be accounted for\nstraightforwardly by a package-delivery/belief-transfer model.\nWe\u2019ll need some extra resources to do that, and it\u2019s\ncontroversial which resources are best suited for the job. Above,\nwe\u2019ve introduced the issue and some of the main proposals for\nresolving it. Readers interested in exploring these topics further\nmight start with the papers contained in Garc\u00eda-Carpintero and\nTorre (2016), as well as the others papers cited above.\n",
