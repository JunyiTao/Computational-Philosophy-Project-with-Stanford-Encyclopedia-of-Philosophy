    "main_text": "\n\nAction is a means of acquiring perceptual information about the\nenvironment. Turning around, for example, alters your spatial\nrelations to surrounding objects and, hence, which of their properties\nyou visually perceive. Moving your hand over an object\u2019s surface\nenables you to feel its shape, temperature, and texture. Sniffing and\nwalking around a room enables you to track down the source of an\nunpleasant smell. Active or passive movements of the body can also\ngenerate useful sources of perceptual information (Gibson 1966, 1979).\nThe pattern of optic flow in the retinal image produced by forward\nlocomotion, for example, contains information about the direction in\nwhich you are heading, while motion parallax is a \u201ccue\u201d\nused by the visual system to estimate the relative distances of\nobjects in your field of view. In these uncontroversial ways and\nothers, perception is instrumentally dependent on action. According to\nan explanatory framework that Susan Hurley (1998) dubs the\n\u201cInput-Output Picture\u201d, the dependence of perception on\naction is purely instrumental:\n\n\nMovement can alter sensory inputs and so result in different\nperceptions\u2026 changes in output are merely a means to changes in\ninput, on which perception depends directly. (1998: 342)\n\n\nThe different action-based theories of perception, reviewed in this\nentry, challenge the Input-Output Picture. They maintain that\nperception can also depend in a noninstrumental or\nconstitutive way on action (or, more generally, on capacities\nfor object-directed motor control). This position has taken many\ndifferent forms in the history of philosophy and psychology (for\noverviews, see Mandik 2005; Chemero 2011; Creem\u2010Regehr &\nKunz 2010; Nanay 2013; Drayson 2017; Springle & Machamer 2016;\nGrush & Springle 2019; and Ferretti 2021). Most action-based\ntheories of perception in the last 300 years, however, have looked to\naction in order to explain how vision, in particular, acquires either\nall or some of its spatial representational content.\nAccordingly, these are the theories on which we shall focus here.\n\nThis entry is historically structured. We begin in\n Section 1\n by discussing George Berkeley\u2019s Towards a New Theory of\nVision (1709), the historical locus classicus of\naction-based theories of perception, and one of the most influential\ntexts on vision ever written. Berkeley argues that the basic or\n\u201cproper\u201d deliverance of vision is not an arrangement of\nvoluminous objects in three-dimensional space, but rather a\ntwo-dimensional manifold of light and color. We then turn to a\ndiscussion of Lotze, Helmholtz, and the local sign doctrine.\nThe \u201clocal signs\u201d were felt cues for the mind to know what\nsort of spatial content to imbue visual experience with. For Lotze,\nthese cues were \u201cinflowing\u201d kinaesthetic feelings that\nresult from actually moving the eyes, while, for Helmholtz, they were\n\u201coutflowing\u201d motor commands sent to move the eyes.\n\nIn\n Section 2,\n we discuss sensorimotor contingency theories, which became prominent\nin the latter half of the 20th century. These views\nmaintain that an ability to predict the sensory consequences of\nself-initiated actions is necessary for perception. Among the\nmotivations for this family of theories is the problem of visual\ndirection constancy\u2014why do objects appear to be stationary\neven though the locations on the retina to which they reflect light\nchange with every eye movement?\u2014as well as experiments on\nadaptation to optical rearrangement devices (ORDs) and sensory\nsubstitution.\n\nSection 3\n examines two other important 20th century theories.\nAccording to what we shall call the motor component\ntheory, efference copies generated in the oculomotor system\nand/or proprioceptive feedback from eye-movements are used together\nwith incoming sensory inputs to determine the spatial attributes of\nperceived objects. Efferent readiness theories, by\ncontrast, look to the particular ways in which perceptual states\nprepare the observer to move and act in relation to the\nenvironment. The modest readiness theory, as we shall\ncall it, claims that the way an object\u2019s spatial attributes are\nrepresented in visual experience can be modulated by one or another\nform of covert action planning. The bold readiness\ntheory argues for the stronger claim that perception just\nis covert readiness for action.\n\nIn\n Section 4,\n we move to the disposition theory, most\ninfluentially articulated by Gareth Evans (1982, 1985), but more\nrecently defended by Rick Grush (2000, 2007). Evans\u2019 theory is,\nat its core, very similar to the bold efferent readiness theory. There\nare some notable differences, though. Evans\u2019 account is more\nfinely articulated in some philosophical respects. It also does not\nposit a reduction of perception to behavioral dispositions, but rather\nposits that certain complicated relations between perceptual input and\nbehavioral provide spatial content. Grush proposes a very specific\ntheory that is like Evans\u2019 in that it does not posit a\nreduction, but unlike Evans\u2019 view, does not put behavioral\ndispositions and sensory input on an undifferentiated footing.\n",
