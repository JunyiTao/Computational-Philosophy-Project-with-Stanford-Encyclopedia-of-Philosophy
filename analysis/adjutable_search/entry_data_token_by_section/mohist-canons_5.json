    "main_text": "Ethics || Relation Ranking\n3.3 Relation Ranking\n\nPerhaps partly to answer such critics, the later Mohists developed a\ndoctrine they called \u201crelation ranking\u201d (l\u00fan\nli\u00e8 \u502b\u5217). This is a code according to which\nwe are to care for everyone while benefiting some people more and\nothers less, in proportion to their relation to us. Our different\nobligations to people are determined by general standards of morality\n(y\u00ec)\u2014most likely, by conforming to the social\nd\u00e0o (conventional practices) that best promotes the benefit of all.\n\u201cDoing more for those whom morality (y\u00ec\n\u7fa9) permits doing more for and less for those whom morality\npermits doing less for is called \u2018relation\nranking.\u2019\u2026If the kinship is close, do more; if the\nkinship is distant, do less\u201d (EC9). Those for whom we are to do\nmore include the sovereign, government officers, elders, and relatives\n(EC9). Inclusive care thus does not entail equal treatment of or\nobligations to others. In practice, the later Mohist view would\nprobably coincide roughly with the view attributed to a Mohist named\nYi Zhi in a dialogue in the Mencius (3A5): \u201cIn care, no\ndegrees; in practice, begin from one\u2019s parents.\u201d \n\nAnother fragment indicates that we ourselves are among those for whom\nwe are to do more: \u201cCaring about [other] people does not exclude\noneself; oneself is among those one cares about\u2026. Caring about\noneself according to relation ranking is \u2018caring about\npeople\u2019\u201d (EC10). So the Mohists were not committed to\nselfless altruism. As long as we do not exceed the degree stipulated\nby morality (y\u00ec), doing more for ourselves and our\ncircle than for outsiders does not count as selfishness, but as\nconformity with the moral norm of all-inclusive care for all. On the\nother hand, benefiting some people more and others less without\nconforming to \u201crelation ranking\u201d is acting \u201cfor the\nsake of oneself\u201d (EC10) rather than on behalf of all, as\nmorality requires. \n\nThe texts provide enough detail about \u201crelation ranking\u201d\nfor us to speculate that later Mohist ethics is consequentialist at\nthe foundational level. Given the statements that morality\n(y\u00ec) is benefit (l\u00ec) (A8), that in our\ncommitments, we are to take all the world as our\n\u201cportion,\u201d or object of responsibility (A8), and that care\nfor all is to be equal (EC13), the most explanatorily powerful\nhypothesis for the empirical content of those texts is that the theory\nis foundationally consequentialist. \u201cRelation ranking\u201d was\nthus probably justified as a code of conduct on the grounds that its\npractice best promoted the welfare of all, making later Mohist ethics\na form of indirect social-practice consequentialism. The Mohist\nposition would have been that in practice the welfare of all is best\nsecured by having everyone follow conventional relationship-roles\nwhere the whole social system leads to more universal well-being that\nan alternate set of social practices. So doing more for closer\nrelations and less for distant would still be moral where everyone\nfollowed that convention, e.g. the elderly would generally have been\nmore effectively cared for by their children, who loved them and\nbetter understood their needs, than by strangers. So equal concern for\nthe welfare of all would have justified a code in which individuals\nprovided primarily for their own elderly parents, not others\u2019.\nThis social d\u00e0o could have been expected to meet the needs of most\nelderly, so it would have been unnecessary for everyone to provide\nequal benefits for other people\u2019s parents. Outside of the\nfamily, generally only orphans and the childless elderly would have\nrequired help. The Mohists probably expected the burden of caring for\nthem to be split across society, with the relatively well-off\ncontributing from their surplus resources. \n\n\u201cRelation ranking\u201d would thus have generated a system of\npractices and duties based on social relations that was largely\ncongruent with the role-based duties recognized by the Ru\n(\u201cerudites,\u201d or Confucians), the Mohists\u2019 main\nopponents. The major difference would have been in how the two schools\ngrounded their views. Confucian ethics starts with a conception of the\nconduct appropriate to persons standing in various types of\nrelationships and works outward, proposing an ideal by which persons\nextend concern for their in-group to embrace outsiders. Mohist ethics\nstarts from the conviction that the only objectively or impartially\njustified f\u01ce (model or standard) of conduct is to\npromote the welfare of all. It then works downward, proposing a code\nof practices associated with particular social relations that, if\ngenerally followed, would best promote everyone\u2019s welfare. The\ngeneral f\u01ce (model) of promoting the welfare of all and\nthe practices it grounds function as reasons for action analogous to\nmoral principles. In the structure of the Mohist theory, however, they\nare conceptualized not as universal principles, applied by deductive\nreasoning, but as models or exemplars, applied by pattern recognition\nand analogical reasoning, against which we compare social practices or\nindividual conduct to determine what is sh\u00ec (right)\nand f\u0113i (wrong). \n\nOn this interpretation, then, the later Mohist ethical theory is a\nplausible form of indirect consequentialism, though its formal\nstructure is distinct from familiar forms of rule consequentialism in\nfocusing on models and social practices rather than rules or\nprinciples. However, one of the\n problems\n with early Mohist ethics arises again in the later, more\nsophisticated theory. According to \u201crelation ranking,\u201d we\nare to do more to benefit those closest to us. But, consistent with\nearlier statements of the doctrine of inclusive care, the later\nMohists also hold that we should care equally for all of humanity. Our\ntreatment of others is to vary with their relation to us, but our\ndegree of care for them is not. For example, though we are to devote\nmore resources to ourselves than to distant strangers, there is to be\nno difference in the strength of our care (ai) for ourselves\nand for them (EC10). We are to be as concerned for others\u2019\nparents as for our own (EC12). Inclusive care is equal for all, and\ncare about each person should be equal (EC13); the degree of\n\u201ccare about others\u201d that we direct toward one individual\nis to be the same as that we direct toward any other (EC2). Indeed,\nwere the whole world to be harmed by the death of one individual, we\nwould expend vastly more effort looking after that person, but our\ndegree of moral care would not increase\n (EC4).[6]\n On the other hand, concern for an individual cannot be abandoned,\neven if the world were to benefit (EC2). \n\nA critic might charge that this doctrine commits the Mohists to a\ncounterintuitive split between the level of treatment we provide to\nothers and the degree to which we care about their welfare. A more\nnatural approach, the critic might argue, would be to allow the degree\nof care to vary with the closeness of the relationship, with the\nproviso that even distant strangers be the object of at least a\nminimal degree of care. This approach might allow individuals to\nperform the social roles of government official, subject, parent,\nchild, and so forth more effectively, thus promoting the welfare of\nall. One might also question whether the costs of training everyone to\nmaintain an equal degree of care for everyone else would not be too\nhigh, and whether it would even be psychologically feasible for us to\ndevote more time, attention, and assistance to those closest to us\nwithout also caring more about them. In the Mohists\u2019 defense,\nhowever, we might argue that by \u201ccare\u201d (\u00e0i\n\u611b) they seem to be referring primarily to a social attitude of\nmoral regard or consideration, not one of individual, affective\nconcern or attachment. For they see equal care as compatible with\nfilial devotion (xi\u00e0o \u5b5d) and parental\ncompassion (c\u00ed \u6148), virtues normally associated\nwith special affective concern for one\u2019s parents or children,\nand they tie the absence of care to utter disregard for others\n(Mozi, Books 14\u201316). If in fact \u201ccare\u201d here\ncorresponds to moral consideration, then the Mohists may be on firm\nground in advocating equal care for all. On the other hand, if\n\u201ccare\u201d does refer primarily to an affective attitude, the\ndoctrine of \u201crelation ranking\u201d could easily be modified to\nallow different degrees of care on the same consequentialist grounds\nthat justify different degrees of benefit: doing so would better\npromote the welfare of all. Alternatively, the Mohists could recast\nthe doctrine of equal care as a doctrine about moral justification:\nInstitutions and practices are to be justified on the grounds that\nthey reflect equal concern for the welfare of all. Educating people to\nthink of justification in this way would probably be feasible; indeed,\nit might correspond largely to what we think of as commonsense moral\neducation. \n\nThough the Mohists advocate concern for all, it is unclear to what\nextent they endorse respect for the life or dignity of individuals. On\nthe one hand, care about an individual cannot be abandoned, even if\nthe world were to benefit (EC2). But one fragment in the\nDialectics states, \u201cCaring about them equally, select\nand execute one person among them,\u201d and \u201cif the benefit to\nthe world is equal, then there\u2019s no choosing between them. If\nthe benefit of death and life are as one, then there\u2019s no\nchoosing between them\u201d (EC6). Given their lack of context, any\ninterpretation of these remarks must be tentative. But they might be\ntaken to suggest that the only fundamental consideration in Mohist\nethics is the greater benefit of all the world, not respect for\nindividuals\u2019 dignity or the intrinsic value of their lives.\nThese remarks might seem to permit sacrificing an individual to\nincrease overall welfare, or even just as long as there is no net\ndecrease in welfare. However, the same fragment continues,\n\u201cKilling a person to save the world, it\u2019s not that we kill\na person to benefit the world; killing oneself to save the world,\nit\u2019s that one kills oneself to benefit the world.\u201d This\nseems to indicate that even in the extreme case in which we can save\nthe world by sacrificing another\u2019s life, we do so not merely on\nthe grounds of the net benefit to the world, since adopting such\ngrounds might suggest that we could routinely sacrifice individuals\nfor the benefit of society in less extreme cases as well. Rather, we\ndo so because of the massive discrepancy between the harm we inflict\nand that we prevent\u2014the loss of a single life versus loss of the\nwhole world. If the life to be given up is our own, on the other hand,\nthe fragment seems to imply that we should make the sacrifice on the\ngrounds of benefiting the world, though only if the consequences are\nsuitably weighty.\n",
