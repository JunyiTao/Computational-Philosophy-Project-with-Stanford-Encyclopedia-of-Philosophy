    "main_text": "Discourse on scientific method || Privileged methods and \u2018gold standards\u2019\n6.2 Privileged methods and \u2018gold standards\u2019\n\nReference to the scientific method has also often been used to argue\nfor the scientific nature or special status of a particular activity.\nPhilosophical positions that argue for a simple and unique scientific\nmethod as a criterion of demarcation, such as Popperian falsification,\nhave often attracted practitioners who felt that they had a need to\ndefend their domain of practice. For example, references to\nconjectures and refutation as the scientific method are abundant in\nmuch of the literature on complementary and alternative medicine\n(CAM)\u2014alongside the competing position that CAM, as an\nalternative to conventional biomedicine, needs to develop its own\nmethodology different from that of science.\n\nAlso within mainstream science, reference to the scientific method is\nused in arguments regarding the internal hierarchy of disciplines and\ndomains. A frequently seen argument is that research based on the H-D\nmethod is superior to research based on induction from observations\nbecause in deductive inferences the conclusion follows necessarily\nfrom the premises. (See, e.g., Parascandola 1998 for an analysis of\nhow this argument has been made to downgrade epidemiology compared to\nthe laboratory sciences.) Similarly, based on an examination of the\npractices of major funding institutions such as the National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and\nthe Biomedical Sciences Research Practices (BBSRC) in the UK,\nO\u2019Malley et al. (2009) have argued that funding agencies seem to\nhave a tendency to adhere to the view that the primary activity of\nscience is to test hypotheses, while descriptive and exploratory\nresearch is seen as merely preparatory activities that are valuable\nonly insofar as they fuel hypothesis-driven research.\n\nIn some areas of science, scholarly publications are structured in a\nway that may convey the impression of a neat and linear process of\ninquiry from stating a question, devising the methods by which to\nanswer it, collecting the data, to drawing a conclusion from the\nanalysis of data. For example, the codified format of publications in\nmost biomedical journals known as the IMRAD format (Introduction,\nMethod, Results, Analysis, Discussion) is explicitly described by the\njournal editors as \u201cnot an arbitrary publication format but\nrather a direct reflection of the process of scientific\ndiscovery\u201d (see the so-called \u201cVancouver\nRecommendations\u201d, ICMJE 2013: 11). However, scientific\npublications do not in general reflect the process by which the\nreported scientific results were produced. For example, under the\nprovocative title \u201cIs the scientific paper a fraud?\u201d,\nMedawar argued that scientific papers generally misrepresent how the\nresults have been produced (Medawar 1963/1996). Similar views have\nbeen advanced by philosophers, historians and sociologists of science\n(Gilbert 1976; Holmes 1987; Knorr-Cetina 1981; Schickore 2008; Suppe\n1998) who have argued that scientists\u2019 experimental practices\nare messy and often do not follow any recognizable pattern.\nPublications of research results, they argue, are retrospective\nreconstructions of these activities that often do not preserve the\ntemporal order or the logic of these activities, but are instead often\nconstructed in order to screen off potential criticism (see Schickore\n2008 for a review of this work).\n",
