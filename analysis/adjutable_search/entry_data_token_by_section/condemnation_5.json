    "main_text": "The doctrinal significance of Tempier\u2019s condemnation\n6. Tempier\u2019s other 1277 condemnations\n\nAlthough Tempier\u2019s action of March 7, 1277 is best known in the\nhistoriography of philosophy, mention should also be made of two\nadditional doctrinal investigations of 1277 that are attributed to\nBishop Tempier. The first one concerned the theologian Giles of Rome,\nand was concluded before March 28, 1277 with the censure of fifty-one\npropositions taken from Giles\u2019s commentary on the\nSentences. The second doctrinal inquiry was aimed against\nThomas Aquinas. It was begun after Giles\u2019s censure, but still\nbefore March 28, 1277. According to Robert Wielockx, the inquiry\nagainst Thomas Aquinas was never completed. Basing his conclusions on\nevidence provided in a letter by John Pecham, Wielockx claimed that\nduring the vacancy of the Apostolic See, sometime between May 20 and\nNovember 25, 1277, Tempier received orders from the curia to stop his\ninvestigation.\n\nWielockx\u2019s thesis of a separate process against Thomas Aquinas\nhas been generally accepted in the scholarly literature. However,\nrecently the historical evidence has been reexamined and his\ninterpretation been questioned by John Wippel and Hans Thijssen, the\nlatter in the context of a substantially revised account of the\njuridical procedures against Giles of Rome.\n",
