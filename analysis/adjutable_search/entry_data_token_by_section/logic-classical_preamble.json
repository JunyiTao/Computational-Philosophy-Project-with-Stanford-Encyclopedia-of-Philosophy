    "main_text": "\n\nTypically, a logic consists of a formal or informal language\ntogether with a deductive system and/or a model-theoretic semantics.\nThe language has components that correspond to a part of a natural\nlanguage like English or Greek. The deductive system is to capture,\ncodify, or simply record arguments that are valid\nfor the given language, and the semantics is to capture, codify, or\nrecord the meanings, or truth-conditions for at least part of the\nlanguage.\n\nThe following sections provide the basics of a typical logic,\nsometimes called \u201cclassical elementary logic\u201d or\n\u201cclassical first-order logic\u201d. Section 2 develops a formal\nlanguage, with a rigorous syntax and grammar. The formal language is a\nrecursively defined collection of strings on a fixed alphabet. As\nsuch, it has no meaning, or perhaps better, the meaning of its\nformulas is given by the deductive system and the semantics. Some of\nthe symbols have counterparts in ordinary language. We define an\nargument to be a non-empty collection of sentences in the\nformal language, one of which is designated to be the conclusion. The\nother sentences (if any) in an argument are its premises. Section 3\nsets up a deductive system for the language, in the spirit of natural\ndeduction. An argument is derivable if there is a deduction\nfrom some or all of its premises to its conclusion. Section 4 provides\na model-theoretic semantics. An argument is valid if there is\nno interpretation (in the semantics) in which its premises are all\ntrue and its conclusion false. This reflects the longstanding view\nthat a valid argument is truth-preserving.\n\nIn Section 5, we turn to relationships between the deductive system\nand the semantics, and in particular, the relationship between\nderivability and validity. We show that an argument is derivable only\nif it is valid. This pleasant feature, called soundness,\nentails that no deduction takes one from true premises to a false\nconclusion. Thus, deductions preserve truth. Then we establish a\nconverse, called completeness, that an argument is valid only\nif it is derivable. This shows that the deductive system is rich\nenough to provide a deduction for every valid argument. So there are\nenough deductions: all and only valid arguments are derivable. We\nbriefly indicate other features of the logic, some of which are\ncorollaries to soundness and completeness.\n\nThe final section, Section 6, is devoted to the a brief examination of\nthe philosophical position that classical logic is \u201cthe one\nright logic\u201d.\n",
