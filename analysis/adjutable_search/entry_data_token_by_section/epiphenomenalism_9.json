    "main_text": "Arguments in the Age of Materialism || Epiphenomenalism and Intrinsic Properties\n3.4 Epiphenomenalism and Intrinsic Properties\n\nFrank Jackson (1982) has given an epiphenomenalistic argument that has\nspawned lively responses from many quarters. This argument turns on\nthe concept of physical information, where \u201cphysical\ninformation\u201d is information about ourselves and our world of the\nkind that is obtainable in the physical, chemical, and biological\nsciences. In Jackson\u2019s argument, a brilliant scientist, Mary,\nhas learned all the physical information there is about color vision.\nHaving been confined to a black and white room, however, Mary has\nnever had a color experience. Jackson asks whether Mary will learn\nanything when she is released from her confinement and thus comes for\nthe first time to have color experiences. It seems compelling that she\nwould learn something; but as she already has all the physical\ninformation there is, what she learns must be some other kind of\ninformation, which we may call \u201cphenomenal information\u201d.\nThis \u201cknowledge argument\u201d has been regarded as a strong\nreason to accept a dualistic view of our experiences. When combined\nwith the traditional arguments (Pro) given above, it becomes a potent\nsource of support for epiphenomenalism.\n\nDavid Lewis (1988) undertakes a thorough response to the knowledge\nargument. Among Lewis\u2019s many considerations, there is one that\nseeks to enforce a connection between phenomenal information per\nse and epiphenomenalism. According to Lewis\u2019s argument,\neven if one says that phenomenal events are identical with\nphysical events, and even if one says that phenomenal events produce\nphysical effects in violation of physical laws, one will still be led\nto a form of epiphenomenalism if one says there is phenomenal\ninformation that is irreducibly different from physical information.\nTo put the argument in ruthlessly summary form, let \\(V_1\\) and\n\\(V_2\\) be two possibilities for the phenomenal information that one\nacquires by, and only by, tasting Vegemite. Suppose that \\(P_1\\) is a\nphysical state produced by the taste of Vegemite. That the taste of\nVegemite has this physical effect is a piece of physical information.\nBut this same physical information is compatible with two\npossibilities, (a) \\(V_1\\) is related by a law, \\(L_1\\), to \\(P_1\\);\nand (b) \\(V_2\\) is related by a different law, \\(L_2\\), to \\(P_1\\).\nNow, either of these possibilities is compatible with all the physical\ninformation we have; i.e., their difference makes no physical\ndifference. Thus, that the phenomenal information in the taste of\nVegemite is, say, \\(V_1\\) rather than \\(V_2\\) can make no difference\nto anything physical, i.e., \\(V_1\\) is epiphenomenal. Lewis\u2019s\npoint here is not to argue for or against epiphenomenalism; rather, he\nassumes epiphenomenalism is false, and uses the fact that the\nhypothesis of phenomenal information leads to it as an argument\nagainst that hypothesis.\n\nDenis Robinson (1993) raises the possibility that Lewis\u2019s\nargument can be extended to produce a far-reaching and puzzling\nresult. Suppose that \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\) are two possibilities for an\nintrinsic property of a basic physical entity, e.g., a quark.\nEverything relevant to physics can be expressed by the lawlike\nrelations in which quarks stand to fundamental physical objects and\nproperties. Let this set of relations be \\(\\mathbf{S}\\). It appears\nthat there are two possibilities, (a) \\(I_1\\) is related by a set of\nlaws, \\(\\mathbf{L_1}\\), to \\(\\mathbf{S}\\); or (b) \\(I_2\\) is related\nby a different set of laws, \\(\\mathbf{L_2}\\), to \\(\\mathbf{S}\\).\nEither of these possibilities is compatible with all the physics we\nhave, i.e., their difference makes no physical difference. Thus, that\nthe intrinsic property of quarks is, say, \\(I_1\\) rather than \\(I_2\\)\ncan make no difference to physics, i.e., \\(I_1\\) is epiphenomenal. The\ngeneralization of this point is that the intrinsic properties of the\nfundamental objects of physics must be epiphenomenal.\n\nIt thus appears that we must either (1) deny that fundamental objects\nof physics have any intrinsic properties, or (2) deny that\nLewis\u2019s argument for the connection of phenomenal information\nwith epiphenomenalism is sound, or (3) deny that Lewis\u2019s\nargument can be paralleled in the suggested way for the case of\nintrinsic physical properties, or (4) admit an epiphenomenalism of\nintrinsic properties into our view of the basic structure of physical\nreality.\n\nBertrand Russell (1927, 382) held the view that physical theory can\nreveal only causal structure, or \u201cformal properties\u201d of\nmatter, and that \u201cby examining our percepts we obtain knowledge\nwhich is not purely formal as to the matter of our brains.\u201d This\nidea is taken up sympathetically (with substantial reworking in a\nquantum mechanical context) by Lockwood (1993). Chalmers (1996)\noffered a useful discussion of the view (now known as\n\u201cRussellian monism\u201d), and expressed some sympathy for it\n\u2014 a sympathy which has increased in intervening years (see,\ne.g., Chalmers 2010). Denis Robinson (1993), however, regards\nintrinsic similarity of fundamental physical entities as different\nfrom similarity of phenomenal properties.\n\nIf phenomenal properties are intrinsic properties of fundamental\nphysical objects, and the latter stand in lawlike relations, then\nlawlike relations will hold between phenomenal properties and some\nphysical occurrences. This conclusion appears to give a causal role to\nphenomenal properties and thus to suggest a way out of\nepiphenomenalism. But if intrinsicality carries epiphenomenality, as\nD. Robinson\u2019s extension of Lewis\u2019s argument suggests, then\nthis way out of epiphenomenalism would be blocked. Moreover, since\nthere is no phenomenal quality that we are always experiencing, no\ninstantiation of a quality by a fundamental physical particle can, by\nitself, be one of our sensations. It is thus not clear that Russellian\nmonism gives any more causal role to our sensations than does\nepiphenomenalism (see Robinson 2018 for elaboration).\n",
