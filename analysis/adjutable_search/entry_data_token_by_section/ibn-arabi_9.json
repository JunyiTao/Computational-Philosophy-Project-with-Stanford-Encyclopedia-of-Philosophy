    "main_text": "Ontology || The Barzakh\n3.4 The Barzakh\n\nIn discussing the ontological role of image/imagination, Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee often uses the term barzakh (isthmus,\nbarrier, limit), which in the Koran is that which stands between the\nsweet and salty seas (25:53, 55:20) and prevents the deceased soul\nfrom returning to the world (23:100). Generally, theologians\nunderstood it to be the \u201clocation\u201d of the soul after death\nand before the Day of Resurrection. Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee employs the\nterm to designate anything that simultaneously divides and brings\ntogether two things, without itself having two sides, like the\n\u201cline\u201d that separates sunlight and shade. He uses the term\nSupreme Barzakh (al-barzakh al-a\u2018l\u00e2) as a synonym\nfor Nondelimited Imagination. It is, in other words, the cosmos, the\nrealm of possible things, which in themselves are neither necessary\nnor impossible, neither infinite nor finite. Or, it is the Breath of\nthe All-Merciful, which is neither Nondelimited Being nor articulated\nwords.\n\nThe Real is sheer Light and the impossible is sheer darkness. Darkness\nnever turns into Light, and Light never turns into darkness. The\ncreated realm is the barzakh between Light and darkness. In\nits essence it is qualified neither by darkness nor by Light, since it\nis the barzakh and the middle, having a property from each of\nits two sides. That is why He \u201cappointed\u201d for man\n\u201ctwo eyes and guided him on the two highways\u201d (Koran\n90:8\u201310), for man exists between the two paths. Through one eye\nand one path he accepts Light and looks upon it in the measure of his\npreparedness. Through the other eye and the other path he looks upon\ndarkness and turns toward it. (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nal-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition, 3:274.28)\n\n",
