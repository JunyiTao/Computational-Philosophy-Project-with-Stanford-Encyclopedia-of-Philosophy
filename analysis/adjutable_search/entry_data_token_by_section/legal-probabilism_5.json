    "main_text": "Probabilistic Toolkit || Source, activity and offense level hypotheses\n1.5 Source, activity and offense level hypotheses\n\nDifficulties in assessing probabilities go hand in hand with the\nchoice of the hypotheses of interest. To some approximation,\nhypotheses can be divided into three levels: offence, activity, and\nsource level hypotheses. At the offence level, the issue is whether\nthe defendant is guilty, as in the statement \u201cSmith is guilty of\nmanslaughter\u201d. At the activity level, hypotheses describe what\nhappened and what those involved did or did not do. An example of\nactivity level hypothesis is \u201cSmith stabbed the victim\u201d.\nFinally, source level hypotheses describe the source of the traces,\nsuch as \u201cThe victim left the stains at the scene\u201d, without\nspecifying how the traces got there. Overlooking differences in\nhypothesis level can lead to serious confusions.\n\nConsider a case in which a DNA match is the primary incriminating\nevidence. DNA evidence is one of the most widely used forms of\nquantitative evidence currently available, but it does not work much\ndifferently from blood evidence or other forms of trace evidence. In\ntestifying about a DNA match, trial experts will often assess the\nprobability that a random person, unrelated to the crime, would\ncoincidentally match the crime stain profile (Foreman et al. 2003).\nThis is called the Genotype Probability or Random Match Probability,\nwhich can be extremely low, in the order of 1 in 100 million or even\nlower (Donnelly 1995; Kaye and Sensabaugh 2011; Wasserman 2002). It\nis tempting to equate the random match probability to \\(\\Pr(\\match\n\\pmid \\textsf{innocence})\\) and together with the prior\n\\(\\Pr(\\textsf{innocence})\\) use Bayes\u2019 theorem to calculate the\nposterior probability of innocence \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{innocence} \\pmid\n\\match)\\). This would be a mistake. Applying Bayes\u2019 theorem is\nof course recommended and helps to avoid the prosecutor\u2019s\nfallacy, the conflation of \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{innocence} \\pmid \\match)\\)\nand \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\textsf{innocence})\\). The problem here lies\nelsewhere. Equating the random match probability with \\(\\Pr(\\match\n\\pmid \\textsf{innocence})\\) overlooks the difference between offense,\nactivity and source level hypotheses. A DNA match cannot speak\ndirectly to the question of guilt or innocence. Even if the suspect is the source of the genetic material at the scene, the match does not establish that the\ndefendant did visit the scene and came into contact with the victim, and even if they did, it does not follow that they committed the crime they were accused\nof.\n\nFew forms of evidence can speak directly to offense level hypotheses.\nCircumstantial evidence that is more amenable to a probabilistic\nquantification, such as DNA matches and other trace evidence, does\nnot. Eyewitness testimony may speak more directly to offense level\nhypotheses, but it is also less easily amenable to a probabilistic\nquantification (see however Friedman 1987, recent results by Wixted\nand Wells 2017, and a survey of related issues by Urbaniak et\nal. 2020). This makes it difficult to assign probabilities to offense\nlevel hypotheses. Moving beyond source level hypotheses requires a\nclose collaboration between scientists, investigators and attorneys\n(see Cook et al. 1998 for a discussion).\n",
