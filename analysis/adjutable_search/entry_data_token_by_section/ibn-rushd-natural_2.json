Nature and Human Form\n\nAt the end of his Long Commentary on Book I, Averroes distances\nhimself from Avicenna in so far as the latter maintains that\nMetaphysics has to prove the composition of matter and form in any\nbody. Averroes claims that only the observation of changes in the\nsubstance can explain the existence of these two principles (LC 47H\nTC83). He is not quoting Avicenna in an exact way, so he may not have\nhad Avicenna\u2019s books of the Shif\u0101\u2019,\n\u201cThe Healing\u201d, at hand. However, he is right in the\ninterpretation, since Avicenna states that the subject matter of\nnatural philosophy is the body as such, not the condition that it is\ncomposed of matter and form (Avicenna, Metaphysics, I.2,\n7).\n\nAvicenna affirms also that the natural philosopher is not allowed to\naddress the question of Nature as a principle but has to receive it\nfrom the metaphysician (Avicenna, Physics, I.5, 39\u201340).\nAverroes, at the beginning of his commentary on Book II follows his\nMaster Aristotle and defines Nature as \u201cprinciple and cause by reason\nof which that in which it is changes [primarily and per se]\nand by reason of which that in which it is rests primarily and by\nitself\u201d (LC 49B TC3). Aristotle\u2019s definition in Phys.\n192b21\u201323, reads perhaps more clearly: \u201cNature is the principle\nand cause of motion and rest in that in which [Nature] inheres\nprimarily and by itself, and not accidentally.\u201d\n\nAccording to Averroes the existence of Nature is self-evident as well\nas its definition; the metaphysician does not have to prove it. He\ndisagrees with Avicenna who seemingly contended that Nature belongs to\nthe class of things that are not self-evident and that the definition\nabove is not known by itself; for this reason the metaphysician should\nhave to explain what Nature is. Averroes is not sure about what\nAvicenna said and he admits that the metaphysician is qualified to\nrefute those views denying the existence of Nature as a principle. He\nguesses that Avicenna was moved to this view \u201cbecause [Aristotle] had\nexplained in Books VII and VIII that every movable has a mover, and\nthere is no doubt about it except for the four elements\u201d (LC 49B).\n\nThey move by themselves but mover and movable are different in them\n(see below \u00a7 12), and Avicenna would falsely understand that\nAristotle had not explained it in physics so held that the\nmetaphysician had to do it.\n\nIs Nature a material or formal cause? Aristotle said that some of his\npredecessors, and he names Antiphon among them, held that Nature was\nsolely a material cause, and not a formal cause; they would say that\nNature is fire, earth, air or water (Phys. II.1,\n193a12\u201326). Alexander of Aphrodisias, according to Averroes,\nadded that they also did not know that Nature \u201cwas different\nfrom the other accidents\u201d (LC 51G TC8) and Averroes joins his\nview. Nature is not only matter but form too, and it better deserves\nto be form because form is in actuality as Nature is (LC 52G\nTC12).\n\nWithin the context of Nature as form and \u201cinasmuch as privation\nis a kind of form\u201d (Phys. II.1, 193b18\u201321),\nAverroes insists on a twofold division of form: there are perfect and\nimperfect forms. Perfect forms are free from privation, while\nimperfect, diminutae, forms contain some kind of privation\n(LC 53G TC15). In the example of blackness becoming whiteness,\nwhiteness is perfect form since there is no privation inherent it, but\nblackness is not, since the privation of whiteness inheres it. Form\nhas these double aspects in all contraries existing in qualitative\nchanges. In the case of substantial changes\u2014the generation of\nwater out of air would be one example\u2014doubts arise since\ncontraries are apparently not existent.\n\nAverroes recalls that privation exists in Prime Matter and thinks that\nAristotle \u201cperhaps wanted to say that form is predicated in both\naspects of the disposition and privation existing in Prime\nMatter\u201d (LC 53H TC15). Privation existing in Prime Matter is not\nabsolute privation and Averroes adds a gradation: quodammodo,\n\u201cin a certain way\u201d because this kind of privation is\n\u201clike the form of matter\u201d (LC 53I) that never deserts\nmatter. Averroes tells us that Aristotle will inquire later about the\nissue in the Book De generatione et corruptione, and Book II\nof the Aristotelian Coming-to-be and Passing-away explains\nthe composition of the four elements, the forms of which are the\nprimary contraries, i.e., the four primary qualities (Averroes [SC\nGC]: 27). Averroes anticipates his own conclusion: The kind of\nprivation existing in Prime Matter is such that it is never\ndispossessed of the primary contraries (LC 53K TC15).\n\nNature is form, and perfect form, but \u201cinasmuch as privation is\na kind of form\u201d Nature is affected by the kind of privation\nexisting in Prime Matter, in such a way that Nature can be considered\nan imperfect form. This seems to be Averroes\u2019 interpretation of\nPhys. I.1, 193b18\u201321 concerning the two kinds of\nperfection.\n\nAverroes follows Aristotle who asserts that the philosopher of Nature\nalso has to inquire about the purpose and the means needed for this\npurpose (LC 57EH TC23; Phys. 194a29\u201330) and\nreformulates Aristotle\u2019s reasoning in a syllogistic way: \u201cNature\nis the last of the motions of coming-to-be, but it is nobler than the\nforegoing ones; Everything in this manner is purpose, ergo\nNature is purpose,\u201dand he distinguishes it from death that is solely\nend.\n\nWe had read that the philosopher of Nature is concerned with Prime\nMatter, but \u201csince matter belongs to the genus of\nrelation\u201d, i.e., it depends on its relation to form (LC 58K\nTC26; Phys. II.2, 194b9), its study also involves the study\nof form. Averroes mentions that matter exists on account of form,\npropter formam, and that the philosopher of Nature\ninvestigates both. He investigates form per se, and matter\nbecause of form (LC 58L), but the issue of how far his research can go\narises. The philosopher of Nature searches for form and\n quiddity[4]\n and goes as far as to the last, or highest form on the account of\nwhich matter exists, and this is man\u2019s form, forma\nhominis (LC 59A TC26). Averroes is very assertive and once again\nhe disagrees with Avicenna when he claims that only the metaphysician\ndeals with these forms. For Averroes, the metaphysician studies the\nabstract forms, i.e., existing without matter, while the philosopher\nof Nature, the material forms but also the human form which is an\nintermediate between them and the purely abstract forms (LC 59D).\n",
