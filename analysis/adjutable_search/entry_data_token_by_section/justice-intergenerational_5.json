    "main_text": "No Rights Due to Contingency of Future People Upon Our Decisions? || Responses to the \u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d\n3.1 Responses to the \u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d\n\nConsider a policy of making intensive and extensive use of exhaustible\nresources for the aim of increasing the welfare of currently living\npeople. If the policy is criticized for harming future people on the\nground that this policy will predictably worsen their conditions of\nlife and thus is likely to violate their welfare rights, a defender of\nthe policy could reply by saying: many, if not\n all[4]\n of our actions have (indirect) effects not only on the conditions of\nlife, but also on the number, existence, and identity of future\npersons. This is also true for actions that allegedly harm future\npersons. If the non-performance of the allegedly harmful action would\nhave resulted in the allegedly harmed person not coming into\nexistence, then that person cannot be said to have been harmed by this\naction\u2014or, at any rate, according to the common understanding of\nharm (see Meyer 2003: 147\u2013149, 155\u2013158, for a detailed\ndiscussion).\n\nThe common understanding is informed by a diachronic notion of harm\nand a notion that requires a subjunctive comparison with a historical\nbaseline (hereinafter subjunctive-historical notion of\n harm).[5]\n Both the diachronic and the subjunctive-historical notions of harm\nrequire that the existence of the harmed person or people qua\nindividuals is independent of the harming act or policy. On the\ndiachronic notion of harm, the following formula holds:\n\n(I)\n (diachronic) An action (or\n inaction)[6]\n at time \\(t_1\\) harms someone only if the agent causes (allows) this\nperson to be worse off at some later time\n \\(t_2\\)[7]\n than the person was before \\(t_1\\).\n\n\nOn the subjunctive-historical notion of harm, the corresponding\nnecessary condition for harming is:\n\n(II)\n (subjunctive-historical) An action (or inaction) at time \\(t_1\\)\nharms someone only if the agent causes (or allows) this person to be\nworse off at some later time \\(t_2\\) than the person would have been\nat \\(t_2\\) had the agent not interacted with (or acted with respect\nto) this person at\n all.[8]\n\n\nWhen considering future individuals as possible individuals both the\ndiachronic and the subjunctive-historical notions of harm will exclude\nthe possibility of present people harming future people, for the\n(future) people whose interests and rights they are required to\nrespect are not in a particular state of well-being at the time they\ntake their decision\u2014they do not, at that time, exist. But\naccording to\n (I)\n unless we can claim that the person is in a particular state of\nwell-being at the time of our decision, that is, at \\(t_1\\), we cannot\nsay that the person is worse off at \\(t_2\\) owing to our decision at\n\\(t_1\\). And likewise with\n (II):\n unless we can claim that there is a specific person who would have\nbeen better off at \\(t_2\\) than this person actually is at \\(t_2\\) had\nwe not acted with respect to this person at all, this notion of harm\nmakes no sense.\n\nAdopting either the diachronic or the subjunctive-historical notions\nof harm excludes the possibility of our harming future people when we\nchoose among long-term policies with significantly differing\nconsequences for the quality of life of future people. With respect to\npersons whose existence is dependent upon the allegedly harming\naction, they cannot be worse (or, indeed, better) off owing to this\naction than they would have been had this action not been carried out.\nFor in that case, they would not have existed.\n\nWe can distinguish four main responses to the\n\u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d so understood (compare Boonin 2008:\n134 ff; Page 2008; Heyd 2009b; Roberts 2013; Wrigley 2012: 178):\nFirst, some philosophers hold the view that future people whose\nexistence depends upon currently living people\u2019s actions cannot\nhave rights vis-\u00e0-vis the latter people\u2019s actions (see\nSchwartz 1978; cf. Adams 1979; Kavka 1982; Parfit 1984: part iv;\nBoonin 2008; Roberts 2009). Second, others argue that currently living\npeople can violate the rights of future people even if the former\ncannot harm the latter (see Kumar 2003). If so, future people cannot\nhave welfare rights vis-\u00e0-vis currently living people insofar\nas violating welfare rights implies setting back or harming the\ninterests of the right holders. Third, we can attempt to limit the\npractical significance of the non-identity-problem by limiting the\nrelevant actions to those that are not only likely but indeed\nnecessary conditions of the existence of the concerned\n person.[9]\n\nFinally, some have sought to circumvent the non-identity-problem by\nsuggesting an alternative notion of harm that is unaffected by the\nnon-identity-problem, the so-called \u201cThreshold Conception of\nHarm\u201d (Hanser 1990, 2009; McMahan 1998; Shiffrin 1999; Meyer\n2003, 2009a; Harman 2004, 2009; Rivera-L\u00f3pez 2009). The\nresponse to the \u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d based on the\nthreshold conception is relevantly different from other responses\n(such as those criticized by Heyd in 2009b). The threshold response\ncan be understood to be person-affecting in the weak sense (see\n \u00a71\n above): While the person being harmed according to the threshold\nnotion does not imply that the same person is worse off than she would\nhave otherwise been at that time, it does imply that this person is\nworse off than she ought to be. We owe it to the person when she will\nhave come to existence that she is not in a harmed state (see\n \u00a72.2\n above). Such an understanding is relevantly different from an\nimpersonal understanding according to which the universe is a better\nplace when it does not include people in a harmed state as judged by\nthe threshold Notion (but see Wrigley 2012: 178).\n\nThe threshold notion substitutes the necessary condition:\n\n(III)\n (threshold) An action (or inaction) at time \\(t_1\\) harms a\nperson only if the agent thereby causes (allows) either the coming\ninto existence of this person in a sub-threshold state or the already\nexisting person to be in a sub-threshold state; further, only if this\nperson would not be in the harmed state had the agent not interacted\nwith (or acted with respect to) this person at all; and furthermore,\nonly if the agent, if he cannot avoid causing harm in this sense, does\nnot minimize the harm.\n\n\nAccording to such a threshold notion of harm an action harms a person\nonly if, as a consequence of that action, the (then existing) person\nfalls below a normatively defined threshold (see McMahan 1998:\n223\u2013229; Shiffrin 1999). This threshold notion is unaffected by\nthe non-identity-problem, for here the finding of harm does not\nrequire that the person who is in the sub-threshold state would be in\na better state in the situation that would have obtained in the\nabsence of the harming action. Thus, future people can be said to be\nharmed by currently living people\u2019s actions even if these\nactions are among the necessary conditions of the existence, identity\nor number of future people. Such a notion of harm limits the practical\nsignificance of the non-identity-problem to different degrees\ndepending upon how the threshold is substantially defined (see\n \u00a74\n below).\n\nBoth of the claims discussed above (in\n \u00a71\n and\n \u00a72,\n passim), namely,\n\n\nfirst, that considerations reflecting the welfare rights of future\npeople vis-\u00e0-vis present people can guide the latter in\nchoosing among long-term policies, and\n\nsecond, that considerations of the rights of people not to be brought\ninto existence if they are likely not to realise a certain level of\nwell-being can guide prospective parents in deciding not to conceive\nout of regard for the children they would otherwise have,\n\n\ncan be read as relying upon a threshold notion of harm (Meyer\n2003).\n\nAdopting either the diachronic or the subjunctive-historical notions\nof harm\n (I\n and\n II,\n above) or both excludes, firstly, the possibility of our harming\nfuture people when we choose among long-term policies with\nsignificantly differing consequences for the quality of life of future\npeople, and, secondly, the possibility that we harm persons by\nbringing them into existence if they will have a life worth living.\nBut if we adopt the threshold notion of harm at\n ((III)\n above), future people can be said to be wronged by our choice of a\npolicy that harms them, notwithstanding the fact that the existence of\nthe specific people who are said to be harmed is causally dependent on\nour decision to pursue this\n policy.[10]\n According to (III) parents could act in light of an interest on the\npart of their would-be child in never existing at all: if the child\nwere to be born, it would have a life below the relevant threshold.\nThe subject of harm is the person when she is brought into existence\nin a harmed state. That she would not be worse or better off than she\notherwise would have been is irrelevant for determining that she is or\nwill be in a harmed sub-threshold state (see\n \u00a72.2).\n",
