    "main_text": "Imitation || Republic 10: copy-making\n2.3 Republic 10: copy-making\n\nAs the Sophist does, Book 10 of the Republic treats\nmim\u00easis as a property broader than drama. The topic in\nthis passage (595a\u2013608b) is a mim\u00easis common to\npainting and poetry and much like picturing or copying. It is a\nrelationship between a visible original and its visible likeness.\n\nAs Book 10 begins, Socrates links the coming treatment with what Book\n3 had said about imitation. He also establishes the difference between\nthe passages. What follows will defend Book 3\u2019s banishment of\n\u201cimitative poetry\u201d in terms that the Republic\ndeveloped after Book 3. \u201cNow that we have differentiated the\nsoul\u2019s eid\u00ea,\u201d the danger of imitation becomes\nmore evident (595a\u2013b). An eidos is a kind, and this\nphrase \u201ckinds of soul\u201d is most often taken to mean the\nparts of the soul that Book 4 distinguished (435b\u2013441c). The\nRepublic\u2019s theory of reason, spirit, and desire can enlarge\nwhat had been in Book 3 no more than suspicion about the impersonation\nof ignoble people. The new argument will charge poetry with upsetting\nthe balance among the soul\u2019s parts. (Daniel Mailick contributed to\nthis discussion of the Republic\u2019s psychological theory.)\n\nIn all Plato develops three theses during this first half of Book\n10:\n\nPoetic mim\u00easis, like the kind found in painting, is\nthe imitation of appearance alone, and its products rank far below\ntruth. (596e\u2013602c)\nTherefore poetic mim\u00easis corrupts the soul,\nweakening the rational impulse\u2019s control over the person\u2019s other\ndrives and desires. (602c\u2013608b)\nIt should therefore be banned from the good city.\n\n\nThe argument supporting (1) seeks to spell out how badly poetry and\npainting fare at grasping and communicating knowledge. Partly because\nthey do so badly, but also for other reasons, mimetic arts bring moral\nand psychological ill effects (2).\n\nThe words \u201cimitation of appearance\u201d in thesis (1) follow\nfrom Plato\u2019s three-way differentiation:\n\nForm (of couch, of table) made by a god.\nIndividual things (couches, tables) made by humans.\nPaintings (of couch or table) made by imitators.\n\n\nThe carpenter works with eyes aiming \u201ctoward\n[pros]\u201d the Form (596b)\u2014not with eyes on\nthe Form\u2014so the individual couch the carpenter makes is\nsomething less than the Form: an honest failing after a decent try. If\nthe Form is an object of knowledge, human creators at least possess\ntrue opinion (601e).\n\nThus category II is not a domain of imitation, and the table in a\npainting is not the \u201cimitation of an imitation.\u201d\nNevertheless Plato\u2019s phrase \u201cimitation of appearance\u201d does\ncharacterize artistic mim\u00easis as a compounded problem.\nImitation intensifies a weakness present in existing objects; it not\nonly fails but fails twice, or doubly.\n\nSkipping ahead for a moment, the Republic\u2019s reader finds a\nsecond three-way distinction (601c-602a) that criticizes imitation\nfrom another perspective:\n\nUser (of a flute or bridle) who knows.\nMaker (of flute or bridle) who has correct belief.\nImitator (of flute or bridle) who is ignorant.\n\n\nThis new list is intriguing and hard to make sense of. The three items\nclearly belong alongside the previous three-part ranking. The\ncarpenter who makes a table resembles the leatherworker making the\nbridle; both tripartitions put the visual imitator lowest. But why do\nflautists and jockeys suddenly appear in the top spot, in place of a\ngod so supreme as to create even Forms?\n\nThe answer might appear among the particular manufactured objects that\nthese passages refer to, because for the reader familiar with Greek\nreligion both rankings evoke Athena. The couch- and table-making\ncarpenter practices a trade whose patron is Athena, while myths known\nto Plato depict her as the original user of both flute (Pindar 12th\nPythian Ode) and bridle (Pindar 13th Olympian Ode).\nIf these associations stand up under scrutiny, they put the imitator\nat the opposite pole from a god, rendering the products of imitation\nnot only lowly nothings but malevolently profane, even blasphemous\n(Pappas 2013).\n\nThe argument thus far posits painting as the default case of\nmim\u00easis (Golden 1975, Nehamas 1982, Belfiore 1984, Moss\n2007). But Socrates springboards beyond pictorial art to condemn\ntragedy and its \u201cfather\u201d Homer. Homer was ignorant, never\ntaught a useful thing to anyone (599b\u2013600e). This apparent\nad hominem attack is designed to show that poetry too\nimitates appearance. For that purpose it suffices to show that one\nesteemed poet writes without knowledge. If great poetry can come out\nof someone ignorant, then poetry must not require knowledge. Even if\nignorance is not necessary for the composition of poetry Homer\u2019s\nexample demonstrates that the two are compatible.\n\nModern readers protest: \u201cSomeone can be ignorant and still write\ngreat poetry!\u201d Plato nods in glum agreement, for this is exactly\nthe problem. What good will come of an activity that can not only be\nattempted ignorantly but even succeeded at in ignorance? Poetry too\ntherefore imitates no more than appearance.\n\nIt remains for Plato to argue that poetry harms the soul. He says that\npoetry\u2019s illusions fortify the worst part of the soul and turn it\nagainst the best. The first stretch of this argument (602c\u2013603b)\nuses theoretical language taken from the Republic\u2019s\npsychological theory, while the second (603b\u2013608b) appeals to\nobservable phenomena surrounding performances of tragedies.\n\nSocrates returns to his analogy between poetry and painting. If you\nare partly taken in by a painting\u2019s tricked-up table apparition but\nyou partly spot the falseness, which part of you does which? The\nsoul\u2019s rational impulse must be the part that knows the painting is\nnot a real table. But Book 4 established a fundamental principle: When\nthe soul inclines in more than one direction, this conflict represents\nthe work of more than one faculty or part of the soul (436b; recalled\nin Book 10\u2019s argument at 602e). So being taken in by an optical or\nartistic illusion must be the activity of some part of the soul\ndistinct from reason.\n\nInvoking Book 4\u2019s psychological theory integrates the critique of\npoetry of Book 10 into the Republic\u2019s overarching argument.\nThe dialogue as a whole identifies justice with a balance among\nreason, spirit or anger, and the desires. This controlled balance is\nthe happiest state available for human souls, and the most virtuous.\nImitation undoes the soul\u2019s justice, it brings both vice and\nmisery.\n\nPlato does not specify the irrational part in question. Thinking the\nsun is the size of your hand does not feel like either anger\noverwhelming you or desires tempting. What do illusions have to do\nwith irrationality of motive?\n\nAgain commentaries differ. A complex and fertile debate continues to\nworry over how perceptual error may undermine mental health or moral\nintegrity (Nehamas 1982, Moss 2007). Part of the answer comes from\nBooks 8\u20139, which sketch four character types graded from best to\nworst. These are eid\u00ea \u201ckinds\u201d of soul in a\ndifferent sense, not the species of motives within a soul but the\nspecies that souls may be sorted into. This sorting deserves to play a\nlarger role than it has in the discussion of imitation.\n\nThe pleasures of the lowest soul are distinguished by their illusory\nquality. Desire delights not in true beings but in \u201cidols\n[eid\u00f4lois] of true pleasure\u201d and painted images,\neskiagraph\u00eamenais (586b). Skiagraphia was an\nimpressionistic manner of painting that juxtaposed contrasting hues to\ncreate illusionistic shadow and intensify color (Keuls 1974, Demand\n1975, Petraki 2018), and Plato disapproved of it (Parmenides\n165c\u2013d, Phaedo 69b). (In fact the Republic\u2019s\nattacks on painting are sometimes interpreted narrowly as applying\nonly to skiagraphia.) Thus where Book 9 examines the desirous\npart of the soul and finds its objects to be mere idols, Book 10\ndetermines mim\u00easis to be a show of mere idols and\nconcludes that it keeps company with the soul\u2019s desirous part.\n\nNotice especially the terminology in Book 9. The tyrant is \u201cat\nthe third remove\u201d from the oligarch, his pleasure \u201ca\nthird-place idol [trit\u00f4i eid\u00f4l\u00f4i]\u201d\ncompared to the truth (al\u00eatheia) of the oligarchic\nsoul\u2019s pleasure (587c). Meanwhile the oligarch\u2019s soul stands third\nbelow the \u201ckingly man [tou basilikou]\u201d (587d).\nOnly ten pages later Book 10 echoes this terminology when it calls the\nimitator \u201cthird from the king [basile\u00f4s] and from\nthe truth [al\u00eatheias]\u201d (597e; cf. 602c). The\nlanguage in Book 10 brings Book 9\u2019s equation of base pleasures with\nillusory ones into its attack on art. If Book 10 can show that an art\nform fosters interest in illusions it will have gone a long way toward\nshowing that the art form keeps company with irrational desires.\n\nAnother essential step in the argument is the recognition that what\nBook 3 acknowledged as an exception to its critique, namely the\nimitation of virtuous thoughtful characters, is not apt to exist.\nSocrates has tragedy in mind (comedy secondarily) and observes that\nplaywrights neither know the quiet philosophical type nor profit from\nputting that type on stage before spectators who came to the theater\nto see something showily agitated (604e\u2013605a). At one stroke\nPlato intensifies his condemnation of mim\u00easis, no\nlonger a dangerous technique when it presents the wrong kinds of\npeople but a technique that seldom presents any other kind.\n\nTragedy\u2019s hero, inherently impulsive and impassioned, acts contrary to\nthe dictates of reason. An illusion of virtue guides him. His son dies\nand he doesn\u2019t save his tears for a private moment but lets them flow\npublicly and at length (603e\u2013604a). The spectators\u2019 reason is\nappalled; their other impulses rejoice (605c\u2013e). They reckon\nthat there is no harm in weeping along with the hero, enjoying an\nemotional release without the responsibility one feels in real-life\nsituations. Thus does dramatic illusion induce bad habits of indulging\nthe passions; the soul that had spent its life learning self-control\nsets about unlearning it.\n\nIncidentally this argument turns on an assumption that Plato asserts\nwithout discussion, that mim\u00easis is the presentation or\nrepresentation of characters (e.g. 603c; 605a, c). Although Book 10\nsometimes speaks of mim\u00easis in other terms\n(mim\u00easis of virtues: 600e), the argument about\nfostering passions requires that objects of poetic representation be\nhumans. When what we call literary works practice what we\ncall representation, Plato claims that they represent human\nbeings. For him as for Aristotle drama presents prattontas\n\u201cpeople doing things,\u201d but where Aristotle emphasizes the\nthings done, for Plato it is the people. Character is the essence of\nepic and drama. (Halliwell 1988 argues otherwise.)\n\nPlato\u2019s emphasis on character already predisposes him not to find\nphilosophical worth in literature. A character speaks from a single\npoint of view. Bring several characters together representing several\nidiosyncratic perspectives on the world and the very idea of deriving\na general statement from the work becomes impossible (Laws\n719c\u2013d). This situation is as it were the dramatic corollary to\na general principle in mim\u00easis, that it represents\nplurality or multiplicity and so is forever indeterminate,\nundeterminable.\n",
