    "main_text": "The Aufbau || Significant Aspects of the Published Aufbau\n3.2 Significant Aspects of the Published Aufbau\n\nIn the published Aufbau this abstemious bracketing policy is\napplied very strictly. Carnap adopts a principle of extensionality\nthat does not exclude the use of intensional languages in auxiliary\nroles, but denies them any ultimate significance. Fregean\n\u201cSinn\u201d (sense) is specifically excluded as merely\npsychological (\u00a744), having only \u201cepistemic value\u201d\nbut not \u201clogical value\u201d (\u00a750), which is limited to\nthe extensional meaning of an expression. Each step in the spelled-out\nconstitution of the subjective (\u201cautopsychological\u201d) world\nis explained not only in logical symbols but also in a simple\nparaphrase, then in \u201crealistic language\u201d (as ordinarily\nused in science) and finally in a language of \u201cfictive\nconstruction\u201d. But Carnap makes clear that this is solely for\nconvenience and to make the steps more transparent to readers. The\nfour languages may differ not only in form but in their\n\u201cSinn\u201d, their epistemic value (the different mental images\nthey elicit), he says, though their logical value is always identical\nand is expressed most neutrally and clearly in the symbolic language\n(\u00a795); for more detail, see the supplement\n Aufbau.\n\nBehind this radical extensionalism lies precisely the new strictness\nwith which Carnap applied the Husserlian \u201cbracketing\u201d\nstrategy in 1924\u2014ironically just at the time he abandoned the\nphenomenological development of the constitutional basis. (More\ndetails on Carnap\u2019s extensionalism are to be found in the\nsupplement\n Semantics (Section 2).)\n The most direct expression of this was a more thoroughgoing and\nself-conscious rejection of ontology. In the final chapter of the\nAufbau, which addresses some philosophical problems to which\nthe constitutional system can be applied, the overriding theme is the\nirrelevance of ontological questions to the actual constitutional\nsystem (Friedman 2007). And in the same year as the Aufbau\nCarnap published a pamphlet on Pseudo-problems in Philosophy\n(Carnap 1928b) in which the \u201cproblem of realism\u201d is the\nmost prominent example of such pseudo-problems.\n\nThe actual detailed construction of the autopsychological realm\noccupies only a small part of the book. The first sections focus\nlargely on what Carnap would later call \u201cclarification of the\nexplicandum\u201d (see\n section 1.1\n above). Carnap considers various options for the choice of basic\nelements (the elements or building blocks of which everything is\nto be constructed) and basic relations (the relations between\nand among these building blocks that is to effect the construction).\nThe radicalism of Carnap\u2019s push for simplification is expressed\nby his choice of only a single kind of basic elements,\n\u201celementary experiences\u201d, and a single basic\nrelation, \u201crecollection of similarity\u201d. The elementary\nexperiences were not isolated \u201csense data\u201d of traditional\nempiricism (the isolated pitch and timbre of momentary sounds or\ncolored points of the visual field that we find in Hume or Mach), but\nholistic time slices of total experience, from which nothing has yet\nbeen abstracted; Carnap was here attempting to do justice to the\npsychology courses he had taken as an undergraduate, where he had\nlearned about the new directions taken in Gestalt psychology\nby K\u00f6hler, Koffka, and others. By quasianalysis, an abstraction\ntechnique formalizing Russell\u2019s \u201cprinciple of\nabstraction\u201d, (see the supplement\n Methodology (Section 3))\n the similarities among these time-slices could retrospectively be\ngrouped (by repeated application of the basic relation, recollection\nof similarity) into something like equivalence classes of, say, a\ncertain color or a certain smell that were sufficiently similar. By\nthis means Carnap constructs the subjective cognitive world of a\nsingle mind in some detail, up to the point where, on that basis, a\nthree-dimensional objective world of space-time can be constructed\n(see the supplement\n Aufbau (Section 2)\n for more detail concerning some of these constructions).\n\nAt this crucial point of the Aufbau\n(\u00a7\u00a7125\u20137), the ascent from two to three dimensions,\nwhere Carnap stops spelling out the steps in detail, he also suspends\nthe explicit definition applied up to there, and instead resorts to an\ninformally described optimization approach, whereby certain fairly\nobvious desiderata (continuity of motions, temporal continuity of\nobjects and processes, etc.) are to be maximized subject to certain\n(again fairly obvious) constraints (see the supplement\n Aufbau (Section 3)\n for further details). The construction of the physical realm and the\nfurther realms on its basis (the heteropsychological, social,\ncultural, and value realms) are sketched very sparsely. The book ends\nwith a final section discussing some philosophical consequences of the\nconstitution system, addressing (though only obliquely, and hardly by\nname) both phenomenology and various forms of realism.\n",
