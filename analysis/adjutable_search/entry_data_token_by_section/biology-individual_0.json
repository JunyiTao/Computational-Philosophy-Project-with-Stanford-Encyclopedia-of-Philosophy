    "main_text": "The Focal Question: What are Biological Individuals?\n1. The Focal Question: What are Biological Individuals?\n\nThe biological world contains an incredibly diverse variety of\nindividuals. At the ground level of common sense, there are\nalligators, ants, beetles, marmots, moles, mushrooms, ostriches,\nroses, trees, and whales. At this ground level, biological individuals\nare physically-bounded, relatively well-integrated, autonomous agents,\nthe ones listed being amongst those that can be readily detected with\nthe senses. Extending the reach of common sense through magnification\nallows flagella-propelled protists, tRNA molecules, prions, and\nbacteria of many kinds to be seen or inferred. At larger or collective\nscales, there are herds of zebras, sweeping and astonishing coral\nreefs, algae blooms, biofilms made up of many different species, and\neven fungus complexes several hectares in area and with masses greater\nthan that of an elephant.\n\nWhat we will call the Focal Question\u2014what are\nbiological individuals?\u2014can be paraphrased in a number of\nways:\n\nWhat constitutes being a biological individual?\nWhat makes something a biological individual?\nWhat is the nature of the category biological\nindividual?\nWhat is the best explicative definition of the term\n\u201cbiological individual\u201d?\n\n\nIn the rapidly expanding literature on biological individuals (cf.\nHull 1992 with Guay & Pradeu 2016a, 2016b, and Lidgard &\nNyhart 2017b), such questions take biological individual as a\ngeneral category that may subsume several kinds of biological\nindividual (e.g., evolutionary, developmental, genetic, metabolic).\n\n\nThe psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus\u2019s famous quip that\n\u201cpsychology has a long past, but only a short history\u201d\n(1908: 1, Die Psychologie hat eine lange Vergangenheit, doch nur\neine kurze Geschichte) might well be adapted to remind us that\nanswers to the Focal Question have a long past, one stretching back to\nat least the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the life\nsciences. In their recent collection of essays Biological\nIndividuality, the historians Scott Lidgard and Lynne Nyhart\nreviewed the literature of the past two hundred years to compile a\nlist of twenty three criteria used to define or characterize\n\u201cindividual or its contained subset\norganism\u201d, noting that while \n\n\nthe terms are not equivalent, they have been used interchangeably in\nmany publications, precluding a simple separation here. (2017a: 18)\n\n\n\nAddressing the Focal Question thus calls for sensitivity to this\ntendency in the long past.\n\nAs Derek Skillings says, the \u201ctraditional target of accounts of\nbiological individuality is the organism\u201d (2016: 880), a\ntradition reinforced in some influential contemporary discussions that\nsimply identify biological individuals with organisms (Queller &\nStrassmann 2009, Clarke 2013; see\n section 8\n below). The present review follows Lidgard and Nyhart and others\n(Dupr\u00e9 & O\u2019Malley 2009; Nicholson 2014; Pradeu 2016a,\n2016b) in taking biological individual to name a\nsuperordinate category whose nature and relation to the category\norganism is complex and worthy of exploration.\n\nPhilosophers of biology typically understand biological individuals to\nbe distinct from other kinds of entities in the biosciences, such as\nproperties, processes, and events (though see Dupr\u00e9 2012,\nNicholson 2018, Nicholson & Dupr\u00e9 2018). Biological\nindividuals have three-dimensional spatial boundaries, endure for some\nperiod of time, are composed of physical matter, bear properties, and\nparticipate in processes and events. Biological processes\n(such as photosynthesis) and biological events (such as\nspeciation) lack such a suite of features. Although philosophers have\nexplored the question of what makes anything an individual of\nany kind (e.g., Strawson 1959; van Inwagen 1990; Chauvier\n2016; French 2014, 2016; Lowe 2016; Wiggins 2016), such questions are\nbracketed off here in order to concentrate on biological\nindividuals (cf. Love & Brigandt 2017).\n\nTo provide a sense of the complexities that an answer to the Focal\nQuestion must address, consider two examples that take us from the\nground level of common sense with which this review began to\nthe intimate interplay between empirical data gathered by biologists\nand the conceptual clarification provided by philosophers that is a\nhallmark of thinking about biological individuals. The first of these\nexamples was introduced into discussions of biological individuals by\nthe philosopher of biology Jack Wilson (1999: 23\u201325), the second\nby the physiologist Scott Turner (2000: ch.2).\n",
