Other Interesting Metaphysical Views\n\n\nMcTaggart was a systematic metaphysician and so did what systematic\nmetaphysicians do: on his way to defending one metaphysical view, he\nended up defending several. We will briefly discuss some of the\ninteresting positions he advocated.\n\nHyper-essentialism. McTaggart endorsed a radical form of\nessentialism. Any individual substance save reality as a whole has all\nof its features essentially. In several places, McTaggart seems to\nassert that it is meaningless to ascribe modal features to reality as a\nwhole. See, for example, Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic,\nsection 47, and remarks made in his \u201cThe Further Determination of\nthe Absolute\u201d. This view is motivated by the thought that,\nalthough a substance is distinct from its nature understood as the sum\nof its qualities, it nonetheless is individuated by its nature and so\nmust have it essentially. (See the first volume of the Nature of\nExistence, sections 109\u2013113). McTaggart calls the relation between\nthe parts of a substances\u2019 nature extrinsic\ndetermination, since, given the existence of that substance, all\nof those properties that are parts of that subject\u2019s nature must\nexist and so in that sense determine each other.\n\n\nMcTaggart seems to have flirted with a kind of counterpart theory as a\nway to soothe intuitions that substances might have had different\nproperties than the ones that they in fact have. After considering the\nconsequences of his view for the modal profile of ordinary objects,\nsuch as the mountain Snowdon, he writes:\n\n\nA mountain which differed from the actual Snowdon only in being a foot\nshorter, and in whatever was implied by that, would resemble it so\nclosely in every characteristic that we are interested in that we\nshould certainly give it the name Snowdon. (The Nature of\nExistence, vol. I, 117)\n\n\nAlthough the actual Snowdon couldn\u2019t have been shorter, there\ncould have been a mountain sufficiently like it to warrant us giving it\nthe name \u201cSnowdon.\u201d\n\nReality and Existence. McTaggart distinguished between\nreality and existence, both of which he held to be\nsimple and undefinable qualities. According to McTaggart, the concept\nof being is the same as the concept of reality, and so it is a\ntautology to say whatever is, is\n real.[35]\nReality is a monadic property, and does not\ncome in degrees. Existence is not to be identified with the conjunctive\nproperty of being real and being spatiotemporal, for McTaggart held\nthat no existent is\n spatiotemporal.[36]\nMoreover, reality is not to be\nidentified with existence, since it is conceptually possible that\nsomething might be real without existing.\n\nThat said, everything that is real might also exist. The first portion\nof McTaggart\u2019s the Nature of Existence is devoted to\nshowing that either reality and existence are in fact coextensive, or,\nfailing this, that can learn everything important about what is real by\nstudying what exists. As part of the project of showing this, McTaggart\nargues against the reality of some putative entities that might be\ntaken to be real but non-existent. For example, McTaggart argues that\nthere is no reason to believe propositions (construed as\nabstract objects). According to McTaggart, truth is a relation\nnot between a proposition and a fact but rather between a belief and a\nfact, whereas falsity is a relation between a belief and all\nthe facts: to be false is to fail to correspond with any fact.\nMoreover, on McTaggart\u2019s view, there are no non-existent\nfacts.\n\nMcTaggart also dispenses with possibilities, and argues that\nall statements about possibilities are best understood as concerning\nconnections between existing things. Statements apparently about\npossibilities are really statements about actualities: they are about\nthe actual implications and non-implications of various characteristics\nhad by actual entities. (See section 40 of the first volume of the\nNature of Existence for further discussion.)\n\nMereological Doctrines. McTaggart holds the following\ndoctrines concerning the part-whole relation as it applies to\nsubstances. First, McTaggart endorses unrestricted\ncomposition: whenever there are some substances, there is a\nfurther substance that is composed of them. McTaggart dismisses the\nworry that unrestricted composition implies that there are bizarre\nsubstances such as the substance composed of all the readers of the SEP\nand the moon. (See chapter 16 of the first volume of the Nature of\nExistence.) For this reason, McTaggart holds that there is a\nsubstance that is composed of everything that there is. He calls this\nsubstance \u201cthe Universe\u201d. (See section 77 and chapter 18 of\nthe first volume of the Nature of Existence.)\n\n\nSecond, McTaggart accepts that the doctrine of temporal\nparts is well-founded: if time is real, then objects have temporal\nparts corresponding to each moment at which they exist. If time is\nunreal, then objects have parts corresponding to each node in the real\nC-series that they occupy. This view is articulated in several places\nin both volumes of the Nature of Existence, and it plays a\nminor argumentative role in section 163 of volume I.\nInterestingly, McTaggart does not explicitly argue for the\ndoctrine, but rather seems to think that the doctrine of temporal parts\nwill be \u2018generally admitted\u2019. (See the second volume of\nthe Nature of Existence, section 412.)\n\n\nThird, McTaggart argues that it is a priori that every\nsubstance is gunky. A substance is gunky just in case it has\nproper parts, and every proper part of that substance in turn has\nfurther proper parts. Chapter 22 of the first volume of the Nature\nof Existence contains a defense of this position.\n\nFourth, McTaggart distinguishes between compound substances and\ngroups. A compound substance is a substance that has other\nsubstances as proper parts. On McTaggart\u2019s view, every substance\nis a compound substance. A group also has substances as proper parts,\nbut it not merely a compound substance. Rather, it is something more\nakin to a set or a collection. However, McTaggart\nexplicitly claims that groups are not classes because a class is\n\u201cdetermined by a class-concept, while a group is determined by a\ndenotation.\u201d (See page 276 of \u201cAn Ontological\nIdealism\u201d in his Philosophical Studies, as well as\nchapter XV of the first volume of the Nature of Existence,\nwherein he claims that classes are determined by properties.)\n\n\nIn addition to having substances as parts, groups have them\nas members. On McTaggart\u2019s view, parthood is not\nsufficient for membership. Although the parthood relation is\ntransitive, the membership relation is not. According to McTaggart,\nwhenever there are some substances, they also form a group, and\nwhenever there are some groups they too from a group. Although there is\na universal substance, no group contains all the other groups. Finally,\nno group contains itself as a part. McTaggart appears to have an\niterative conception of the group-theoretic hierarchy, although he\ndenies that there are groups with only one or fewer members.\n\nOne puzzling feature of McTaggart\u2019s mereological system is his\napparent acceptance of a form of relative identity: x\nand y might be the same substance while simultaneously being\ndifferent groups. In section 128 of the first volume of the Nature\nof Existence, McTaggart considers the group consisting of the\ncounties of Great Britain and the group consisting of the parishes of\nGreat Britain. McTaggart argues that although these are not the same\ngroups, we ought to say that they are the same substance. He does not\nappear to merely mean that this substance may be partitioned in two\ndifferent ways, and that corresponding to these ways are two\nnumerically distinct groups.\n",
