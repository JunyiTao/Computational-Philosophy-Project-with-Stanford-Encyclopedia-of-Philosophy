    "main_text": "Empathy and the Philosophical Problem of Other Minds\n2. Empathy and the Philosophical Problem of Other Minds\n\nIt was indeed Lipps\u2019s claim that empathy should be understood as\nthe primary epistemic means for gaining knowledge of other\nminds that was the focus of a lively debate among philosophers at the\nbeginning of the 20th century (Prandtl 1910, Stein 1917,\nScheler 1973). Even philosophers, who did not agree with Lipps\u2019s\nspecific explication, found the concept of empathy appealing because\nhis argument for his position was closely tied to a thorough critique\nof what was widely seen at that time as the only alternative for\nconceiving of knowledge of other minds, that is, Mill\u2019s\ninference from analogy. Traditionally, the inference from analogy\npresupposes a Cartesian conception of the mind according to which\naccess to our own mind is direct and infallible, whereas knowledge of\nother minds is inferential, fallible, and based on evidence about\nother persons\u2019 observed physical behavior. More formally one can\ncharacterize the inference from analogy as consisting of the following\npremises or steps.\n\n\n\n\ni.) Another person X manifests behavior of type\nB. \n\nii.) In my own case behavior of type B is caused by\nmental state of type M. \n\niii.) Since my and X\u2019s outward behavior of type\nB is similar, it has to have similar inner mental causes. (It\nis thus assumed that I and the other persons are psychologically\nsimilar in the relevant sense.) \n\nTherefore: The other person\u2019s behavior (X\u2019s\nbehavior) is caused by a mental state of type M. \n\n\n\n\nLike Wittgenstein, but predating him considerably, Lipps argues in his\n1907 article \u201cDas Wissen von fremden Ichen\u201d that the\ninference from analogy falls fundamentally short of solving the\nphilosophical problem of other minds. Lipps does not argue against the\ninference from analogy because of its evidentially slim basis, but\nbecause it does not allow us to understand its basic presupposition\nthat another person has a mind that is psychologically similar to our\nown mind. The inference from analogy thus cannot be understood as\nproviding us with evidence for the claim that the other person has\nmental states like we do because, within its Cartesian framework, we\nare unable to conceive of other minds in the first place. For Lipps,\nanalogical reasoning requires the contradictory undertaking of\ninferring another person\u2019s anger and sadness on the basis of my\nsadness and anger, yet to think of that sadness and anger\nsimultaneously as something \u201cabsolutely different\u201d from my\nanger and sadness. More generally, analogical inference is a\ncontradictory undertaking because it entails \u201centertaining a\ncompletely new thought about an I, that however is not me, but\nsomething absolutely different\u201d (Lipps 1907, 708, my\ntranslation).\n\nYet while Lipps diagnoses the problem of the inference of analogy\nwithin the context of a Cartesian conception of the mind quite\nsuccinctly, he fails to explain how empathy is able to provide us with\nan epistemically sanctioned understanding of other minds or why our\n\u201cfeeling into\u201d the other person\u2019s mind is more than\na mere projection. More importantly, Lipps does not sufficiently\nexplain why empathy does not encounter similar problems to the ones\ndiagnosed for the inference from analogy and how empathy allows us to\nconceive of other persons as having a mind similar to our own if we\nare directly acquainted only with our own mental states(See Stueber\n2006). Wittgenstein\u2019s critique of the inference from analogy is\nin the end more penetrating because he recognizes that its problem\ndepends on a Cartesian account of mental concepts. If my grasp of a\nmental concept is exclusively constituted by me experiencing something\nin a certain way, then it is impossible for me to conceive of how that\nvery same concept can be applied to somebody else, given that I cannot\nexperience somebody else\u2019s mental states. I therefore cannot\nconceive of how another person can be in the same mental state as I am\nbecause that would require that I can conceive of my mental state as\nsomething, which I do not experience. But according to the Cartesian\nconception this seems to be a conceptually impossible task. Moreover,\nif one holds on to a Cartesian conception of the mind, it is not clear\nhow appealing to empathy, as conceived of by Lipps, should help us in\nconceiving of mental states as belonging to another mind.\n\nWithin the phenomenological tradition, the above shortcomings of\nLipps\u2019s position of empathy were quite apparent (see for example\nStein 1917, 24 and Scheler 1973, 236). Yet despite the fact that they\ndid not accept Lipps\u2019s explication of empathy as being based on\nmechanisms of inner resonance and projection, authors within the\nphenomenological tradition of philosophy were persuaded by\nLipps\u2019s critique of the inference from analogy. For that very\nreason, Husserl and Stein, for example, continued using the concept of\nempathy and regarded empathy as an irreducible \u201ctype of\nexperiential act sui generis\u201d (Stein 1917, 10), which allows us\nto view another person as being analogous to ourselves without this\n\u201canalogizing apprehension\u201d constituting an inference of\nanalogy (Husserl 1931 [1963], 141). Scheler went probably the furthest in\nrejecting the Cartesian framework in thinking about the apprehension\nof other minds, while keeping committed to something like the concept\nof\n empathy.[1]\n (In order to contrast his position from Lipps, Scheler however\npreferred to use the term \u201cnachf\u00fchlen\u201d rather than\n\u201ceinf\u00fchlen.\u201d) For Scheler, the fundamental mistake of\nthe debate about the apprehension of other minds consists in the fact\nthat it does not take seriously certain phenomenological facts. Prima\nfacie, we do not encounter merely the bodily movements of another\nperson. Rather, we are directly recognizing specific mental states\nbecause they are characteristically expressed in states of the human\nbody; in facial expressions, in gestures, in the tone of voice, and so\non. Empathy within the phenomenological tradition then is not\nconceived of as a resonance phenomenon requiring the observer to\nrecreate the mental states of the other person in his or her own mind\nbut as a special perceptual act (See Scheler 1973, particularly\n232\u2013258; For a succinct explication of the debate about empathy\nin the phenomenological tradition consult Zahavi 2010)\n",
