    "main_text": "Compatibilist responses to theological fatalism || The denial of future contingent truth\n2.1 The denial of future contingent truth\n\nOne response to the dilemma of infallible foreknowledge and free will\nis to deny that the proposition T can be true, on the grounds\nthat no proposition about the contingent future is true: such\npropositions are either false (given Bivalence), or neither true nor\nfalse. This response rejects the terms in which the problem is set up.\nSince God wouldn\u2019t believe a proposition unless it were true,\npremise (1) is, on this account, a non-starter. The idea behind this\nresponse is usually that propositions about the contingent future\nbecome true when and only when the event occurs that the proposition\nis about. If the event does not occur at that time, then the\nproposition becomes false. This seems to have been the position of\nAristotle in the famous Sea Battle argument of De\nInterpretatione IX, where Aristotle is concerned with the\nimplications of the truth of a proposition about the future, not the\nproblem of infallible knowledge of the future. But some philosophers\nhave used Aristotle\u2019s move to solve the dilemma we are\naddressing here.\n\nThis approach to the problem had already been endorsed, three years\nbefore Pike\u2019s seminal article, by A.N. Prior (1962), but it\nreceived little initial attention. John Martin Fischer\u2019s first\nanthology of essays on the problem (1989) does not contain a single\npaper advocating this solution. It wasn\u2019t until the 1980s, when\nit was defended by Joseph Runzo (1981), Richard Purtill (1988), and\nJ.R. Lucas (1989), that it began to gain traction in the debate. More\nrecently, Alan Rhoda, Gregory Boyd, and Thomas Belt (2006) have argued\nfor the \u201cPeircean\u201d semantics favored by Prior (1967,\n113\u201336), on which the predictive use of the word\n\u2018will\u2019 carries maximal causal force and all future\ncontingents turn out false, while Dale Tuggy (2007) has defended the\nposition that future contingents are neither true nor false. A\ncritique of both Rhoda et al. and Tuggy may be found in Craig\nand Hunt (2013). Another supporter of the\nall-future-contingents-are-false solution to the problem of\ntheological fatalism is Patrick Todd (2016a), whose recent book (2021)\noffers a vigorous defense of this approach against various objections.\nMany (but not all) of those who reject future contingent truth base\ntheir position, at least in part, on presentism, according to which\nonly the present exists. Statements about the future, especially the\ncontingent future, would then arguably lack the grounding necessary\nfor truth. D.K. Johnson (2009) has taken up this solution to both\nlogical and theological fatalism, as has Dean Zimmerman (2008). A\nmeasure of how much the debate has shifted in this direction is that\nFischer\u2019s second anthology (Fischer and Todd 2015) contains an\nentire section on \u201cThe Logic of Future Contingents.\u201d The\nconnection between this solution and \u201copen theism\u201d will be\ndiscussed in section\n 3.\n\nWhile there is considerable prima facie appeal to the idea that\nstatements about the contingent future aren\u2019t yet true,\nand that they become true only when the future arrives, both\nthe semantic and the metaphysical justifications for this idea can be\nchallenged. A semantics that collapses truth into necessity and\nfalsehood into impossibility, at least for propositions about the\nfuture, may appear insufficiently attentive to people\u2019s actual\nuse of the predictive \u2018will\u2019, not to mention logically\nproblematic. The true futurist theory (\u201cthe thin red\nline\u201d), allowing for future contingent truth, is defended by\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m (2009) and by Malpass and Wawer (2012).\nPresentist opponents of future contingent truth, for their part, need\nto explain how there can be contingent truths about the past but not\nabout the future, given that, on presentism, the past is no more real\nthan the future. (This is not a problem on the growing block theory.)\nRhoda (2009) and Zimmerman (2010), for example, have independently\nsuggested that truths about the past could be grounded in God\u2019s\npresent beliefs about the past; but if this move is allowed, it would\nseem just as legitimate to assume God has present beliefs about the\nfuture and use this to ground truths about the contingent future. The\nsemantic and metaphysical issues surrounding future contingent truth\nare complex and highly contested, so it isn\u2019t possible to do\nmore than note them here.\n\nIt is not clear, however, that the denial of future contingent truth\nis sufficient to avoid the problem of theological fatalism. Hunt\n(2020) suggests that future contingents that fail to be true for\npresentist reasons alone might nevertheless qualify as\n\u201cquasi-true\u201d (Sider 1999, Markosian 2004), and argues that\nthe quasi-truth of God\u2019s beliefs about the future is enough to\ngenerate the problem. The following consideration tends in the same\ndirection. According to the definition of infallibility used in the\nbasic argument, if God is infallible in all his beliefs, then it is\nnot possible that God believes T and T is false. But\nthere is a natural extension of the definition of infallibility to\nallow for the case in which T lacks a truth value but will\nacquire one in the future: If God is infallible in all his beliefs,\nthen it is not possible that God believes T and T is\neither false or becomes false. If so, and if God believes T,\nwe get an argument for theological fatalism that parallels our basic\nargument. Premise (4) would need to be modified as follows:\n\n(4\u2032) Necessarily,\nif yesterday God believed T, then T will become\ntrue. \n\n\n(6) becomes:\n\n(6\u2032)\n It is now-necessary that T will become true. \n\n\nThe modifications in the rest of the argument are straightforward.\n\nIt is open to the defender of this solution to maintain that God has\nno beliefs about the contingent future because he does not infallibly\nknow how it will turn out, and this is compatible with God\u2019s\nbeing infallible in everything he does believe. It is also compatible\nwith God\u2019s omniscience if omniscience is the property of knowing\nthe truth value of every proposition that has a truth value. But\nclearly, this move restricts the range of God\u2019s knowledge, so it\nhas religious disadvantages in addition to its disadvantages in\nlogic.\n",
