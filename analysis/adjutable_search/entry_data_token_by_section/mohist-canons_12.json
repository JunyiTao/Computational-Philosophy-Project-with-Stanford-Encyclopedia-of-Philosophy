    "main_text": "Epistemology || Sources and Objects of Knowledge\n5.2 Sources and Objects of Knowledge\n\nCanon A80 gives a categorization of three sources and four objects of\nknowledge. The sources of knowledge are hearsay, or testimony;\n\u201cexplanation,\u201d or inference; and \u201cin person,\u201d\nor observation. Hearsay or testimony (w\u00e9n \u805e) is\nexplained as \u201creceiving it as passed along.\u201d Elsewhere,\n\u201cpassing along\u201d is glossed as \u201csomeone reports\nit\u201d (A81), and \u201creporting\u201d (g\u00e0o\n\u544a, also \u201cinforming\u201d) is itself explained as\n\u201cmaking someone know\u201d (B9). Explanation\n(shu\u014d \u8aaa) is illustrated by the example\n\u201csquares do not rotate.\u201d Other passages explain it as\n\u201cthat by which one understands\u201d (A72) and as a process of\nciting reasons or causes (NO11). \u201cIn person\u201d or\n\u201cpersonal\u201d (q\u012bn \u89aa) is explained as\n\u201cobserving it there oneself.\u201d This notion is probably the\nclosest the Mohists come to articulating a conception of experience.\nHowever, since they do not, in fact, use any term interpretable as\nexpressing an explicit concept of experience, we should stick closely\nto their terminology and characterize \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d\n(q\u012bn zh\u012b \u89aa\u77e5, B70) as knowledge by\nobservation (gu\u0101n \u89c0). \n\nInterestingly, in discussing \u201cpersonal knowledge,\u201d the\nMohists do not posit any sort of intermediary, such as the British\nEmpiricists\u2019 ideas or impressions, that stands between objects\nand the mind. Rather, we perceive things by means of the sense organs\n(B46), which allow perceived features to enter directly into\n\u201cthe knowing\u201d (A98). \u201cPersonal knowledge\u201d\ncontrasts with \u201cknowledge by explanation\u201d (shu\u014d\nzh\u012b  \u8aaa\u77e5, B70), which is in effect knowledge\nobtained by inference or reasoning. The Mohists probably understand\nexplanation (shu\u014d \u8aaa, also \u201caccount\u201d\nor \u201cdoctrine\u201d) as a process of giving reasons\n(g\u00f9 \u6545) to support or explain some claim (NO11,\nB66). Explanation enables us to obtain knowledge that goes beyond\ndirect personal observation, such as by drawing inferences from\ninformation provided by others. Having been told that an object hidden\nin a room is the same color as a white object before us, we know\n\u201cby explanation,\u201d without observation, that the hidden\nobject is white (B70). In a debate, or bi\u00e0n \u8faf,\nhaving an explanation allows us to assert more than merely that\nsomething does or does not match an agreed-upon model. We can assert,\nfor instance, that a circle is nowhere straight (A98). However,\nknowledge by explanation probably does not reflect a conception of\nreason in itself as a distinct source of knowledge, an idea familiar\nfrom Western rationalism. For the clearest example the Mohists give of\nit is not knowledge of an a priori proposition, but knowledge obtained\nby analogical inference from information provided by an informant\n (B70).[13]\n So \u201cknowledge by explanation\u201d seems a catch-all term for\nknowledge obtained by inference, whether deductive, inductive,\nabductive, or analogical. \n\nIn comparison with the Western tradition, it is notable that the\nMohists privilege neither observation nor explanation\u2014and by\nextension, neither experience nor reason\u2014as a more fundamental\nsource of knowledge. Both are given equal weight. Nor do they\nemphasize a distinction between the type or quality of knowledge\nderived from the two sources, such as that one is more certain than\nthe\n other.[14]\n Moreover, they take observation and explanation to be on a par with a\nthird source of knowledge, \u201chearsay,\u201d or the reports of\nother people. They thus explicitly recognize the social aspects of\nknowledge, a topic that has recently attracted much interest in\ncontemporary epistemology. \n\nThe four objects of knowledge (A80) are names (m\u00edng\n\u540d, words), stuff (sh\u00ed \u5be6, including\nobjects, events, and situations), \u201cmatching\u201d\n(h\u00e9 \u5408), and acting (w\u00e9i\n\u70ba). The first two are explained by their role in language.\nNames are \u201cthat by which we call\u201d (what we use to talk).\nStuff (sh\u00ed) is \u201cwhat we call\u201d (what we\ntalk about). The next two concern the correctness of assertion and\naction. \u201cMatching\u201d is when name and thing fit together\nproperly. \u201cActing\u201d is intentional conduct. \n\nThe first two kinds of knowledge concern acquaintance or\nfamiliarity\u2014what we might call \u201cknowing-of.\u201d\nKnowledge of names probably refers to knowing words, without\nnecessarily knowing how to correctly distinguish what\nsh\u00ed (stuff, objects) they refer to. An example would\nprobably be the\n blind man\n who can use the words \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 in\nstatements such as \u201cBright things are white and dark things are\nblack\u201d but cannot identify black or white objects when presented\nwith them. Presumably the criterion for knowing a name is knowing how\nto use it in at least some contexts.\n\nKnowing stuff probably refers to recognizing objects, events, or\nsituations under some name\u2014at the very least, under the\n\u201call-reaching\u201d or \u201cuniversal\u201d name\n\u2018thing\u2019, which applies to everything\u2014without\nnecessarily knowing the correct name for them. For example, sometimes\nthe same kind of object may have two names, such as \u2018dog\u2019\nand \u2018hound\u2019 (B39). Someone might know of this kind of\nobject and know to call it \u201cdog,\u201d without also knowing to\ncall it \u201chound.\u201d Then the person would know the stuff\nreferred to by \u2018hound\u2019 but not the name\n\u2018hound\u2019. \n\nKnowledge of \u201cmatching\u201d is knowing how to correctly\ndistinguish, or identify, the kind of thing to which a name refers.\nThis is the sort of practical know-how that the blind man lacks. Early\nMohist epistemology seems to have focused on this form of knowledge to\nthe exclusion of the preceding two. The later Mohists also seem to\nhave taken this as their primary focus, since as we saw above they\nexplain both perceptual knowledge and understanding as an ability to\nmatch names with things by describing them (A5) or sorting them into\nkinds (A6). (Clearly, though, a person could learn a good deal about\nsorting into kinds merely on the basis of knowing names.) The fourth\ntype of knowledge, knowledge of acting, is knowing how to act\ncorrectly\u2014probably, given the context, knowing how to respond\nappropriately to the sort of thing denoted by a particular name or\nterm. That this is included in a categorization of the objects of\nzh\u012b (knowledge) underscores the theoretical unity of\nknowledge and action for the Mohists. Cognition and practical wisdom,\nor knowing what to do and when to do it, are both considered aspects\nor forms of zh\u012b (knowledge). \n\nAnother, unfortunately obscure canon identifies four sources of doubt,\nor potential causes of erroneous judgment (B10): accidental\ncircumstances, inconclusive evidence, causal overdetermination, and\ntransience. The first of these seems to refer to error due to atypical\ncircumstances. In a dense fog, for instance, someone might mistake a\nman for an ox. Unseasonable weather might cause a person who has moved\nto a light hut in summer to unexpectedly feel cold. The possibility of\nerror in such difficult or unexpected circumstances can provide a\nreason to doubt a judgment. The second source of doubt is insufficient\nevidence. We have reason to doubt that someone who lifts a load of\nfeathers is strong or that someone who shaves wood along the grain is\nskilled woodworker, because these tasks are too easy to be firm\nevidence of strength or skill. The third source is the presence of\nmultiple causes that could explain something. The cause of a\nfighter\u2019s collapse might have been that he was drinking alcohol\nbefore the match or that he was overcome by the heat of the noonday\nsun. Since we cannot know which factor was decisive, we have grounds\nto doubt any claim that one or the other was. The fourth source refers\nto situations in which the object of knowledge may change, such that\nwhat we know ceases to be the case. An obvious example\u2014the\nMohists do not give one\u2014is knowing the status of the weather. We\nknew it was raining when we ran in from the storm, but after some time\nwe may have grounds to doubt whether it is still raining.\n\nInterestingly, particularly in comparison with the Western tradition,\nthe Mohists do not regard the fallibility of perceptual or cognitive\nprocesses as grounds for doubt. In their view, the sources of doubt\nlie not in the nature of the cognitive subject, but in contingent\nfeatures of particular circumstances\u2014that they are potentially\nconfusing, atypical, causally overdetermined, transient, or simply\nprovide inadequate evidence. With the exception of causal\noverdetermination, in most cases doubt can be resolved by further\ninvestigation. Nor is reality considered inherently unknowable,\nbecause of incessant phenomenal change or because appearances mislead\nus as to how things actually are. Accordingly, ancient Chinese\nskepticism\u2014as expressed in the Zhuangzi, for\nexample\u2014is not concerned with the unreliability of sense\nperception or a gap between appearance and reality, but with the\nproblem of grounding the norms by which we draw distinctions between\nthings. \n\nAn interesting consequence of the Mohists\u2019 account of knowledge\nas grounded in know-how, or practical ability, is that they do not\ntreat justification as a component that must be added to a state\ncorresponding to belief in order to produce knowledge. (Reasons\n(g\u00f9 \u6545) have a role in the later Mohist theory\nof dialectics or argumentation, but not in the canons on knowledge.)\nThe text recognizes a contrast between knowing and \u201ctaking to be\nso\u201d (A24, B10), an attitude corresponding to belief, but this\nattitude is not treated as a constituent of knowledge, to which\nsomething must be added to yield knowledge. Instead, perceptual\nknowledge and discursive knowledge seem to lie primarily in the\nability to recognize and respond to things appropriately, mainly by\nnaming and sorting them correctly. Probably no role is assigned to\njustification because the Mohist conception of knowledge is just a\ntype of reliable capacity. The role of justification in the account of\nknowledge as justified true belief is mainly to exclude accidentally\ntrue beliefs, such as lucky guesses, from counting as knowledge. The\nMohists handle this point by taking only correct naming and sorting\nthat issues from a reliable skill or ability to be knowledge. A\nreliability component is obvious in the case of the discursive\nknowledge characterized in Canon A6, which is a comprehensive,\nsystematic ability to sort things into kinds. But reliability may also\nbe part of the Mohist conception of perceptual knowledge, a\nprerequisite for which is the reliable ability to recognize and name\nthings correctly. The Mohists\u2019 account of knowledge converges in\nplaces with themes in contemporary virtue epistemology, in particular\nwith a position that we might call \u201cability reliabilism.\u201d\nThe relationship between the Mohist view of mind and knowledge and\ncontemporary epistemology is an area that deserves further research.\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 conception of knowledge and understanding as\ngrounded in the ability to name and sort things correctly leads us\nback to the questions we raised in response to their theory of\nlanguage. What determines kind distinctions? What makes it correct to\ndistinguish a particular thing as part of one kind or another? In\npractice, how do we determine to which kinds things belong? These\nquestions must be answered before we can determine whether we actually\nhave knowledge in particular cases. For the later Mohists\u2019\nanswers to these questions, we need to look to their account of the\nnotions of \u201csameness\u201d and \u201cdifference\u201d and\ntheir theory of argumentation. \n",
