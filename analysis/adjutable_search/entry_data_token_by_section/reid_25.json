    "main_text": "Aesthetics\n7. Aesthetics\n\n\nReid's aesthetics is composed of two core theses: that a work, to be\nan artwork, must express the artist's sentiments, and that aesthetic\nproperties, like beauty and sublimity, are strictly speaking\nproperties of the mind of the artist and not properties of material\nobjects. Reid's mature aesthetics exemplifies a remarkable degree of\nsophistication for its time period. First, he possesses a clear\nconcept of the fine arts and offers his readers a taxonomy of them\n(Kivy 2004). Second, Reid discusses the formal or structural\nproperties of artworks in virtue of which they can be appraised in\naesthetic terms. Third, Reid has a theoretical framework that unifies\nhis concept of the fine arts and his account of how formal properties\nof objects make those objects works of art: Reid advocates an\nexpression theory of art, arguably the first Western philosopher to do\nso.\n\n \nBefore explaining Reid's two primary aesthetic theses, first a word\nabout the sources of Reid's aesthetics. The principal sources of our\nknowledge of Reid's aesthetics are manuscripts that Reid used to teach\nhis advanced course on \u2018The culture of the mind\u2019 at Glasgow. These\nmanuscripts are narrow in scope and deal mostly with rhetoric. They\nhave been subsequently collected, edited and published in the\nEdinburgh Edition of Thomas Reid as Thomas Reid on Logic, Rhetoric\nand The Fine Arts (Reid 2004). (Though precise dating of these\nmanuscripts is impossible, we know they predate Intellectual\nPowers (1785) and Active Powers (1788).) In addition to\nthis source, Reid's Glasgow lectures on fine arts were transcribed by\na student, and were subsequently edited and published as Lectures\non the Fine Arts (Reid 1973). These two sources overlap\nconsiderably, and we draw from both, with the caveat that Thomas\nReid on Logic, Rhetoric and The Fine Arts is composed of\nmanuscripts not in Reid's own hand. Lastly, Reid discusses art at\nvarious points in his major works.\n",
