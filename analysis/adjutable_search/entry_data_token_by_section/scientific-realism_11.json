    "main_text": "Antirealism: Foils for Scientific Realism || Historicism\n4.2 Historicism\n\nThe collapse of the logical empiricist program was in part facilitated\nby a historical turn in the philosophy of science in the 1960s,\nassociated with authors such as Kuhn, Feyerabend, and Hanson.\nKuhn\u2019s highly influential work, The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions, played a significant role in establishing a lasting\ninterest in a form of historicism about scientific knowledge,\nparticularly among those interested in the nature of scientific\npractice. An underlying principle of the historical turn was to take\nthe history of science and its practice seriously by furnishing\ndescriptions of scientific knowledge in situ. Kuhn argued\nthat the fruits of such history illuminate a recurring pattern:\nperiods of so-called normal science, often fairly long in duration\n(consider, for example, the periods dominated by classical physics, or\nrelativistic physics), punctuated by revolutions which lead scientific\ncommunities from one period of normal science into another. The\nimplications for realism on this picture derive from Kuhn\u2019s\ncharacterization of knowledge on either side of a revolutionary\ndivide. Two different periods of normal science, he said, are\n\u201cincommensurable\u201d with one another, in such a way as to\nrender the world importantly different after a revolution (the\nphenomenon of \u201cworld change\u201d). (Among the many detailed\nstudies of these topics, see Horwich 1993; Hoyningen-Huene 1993;\nSankey 1994; and Bird 2000.)\n\nThe notion of incommensurability applies to (inter alia) a\ncomparison of theories operative during different periods of normal\nscience. Kuhn held that if two theories are incommensurable, they are\nnot comparable in a way that would permit the judgment that one is\nepistemically superior to the other, because different periods of\nnormal science are characterized by different \u201cparadigms\u201d\n(commitments to symbolic representations of the phenomena,\nmetaphysical beliefs, values, and problem solving techniques). As a\nconsequence, scientists in different periods of normal science\ngenerally employ different methods and standards, experience the world\ndifferently via \u201ctheory laden\u201d perceptions, and most\nimportantly for Kuhn (1983), differ with respect to the very meanings\nof their terms. This is a version of meaning holism or contextualism,\naccording to which the meaning of a term or concept is exhausted by\nits connections to others within a paradigm. A change in any part of\nthis network entails a change in meanings throughout\u2014the term\n\u201cmass\u201d, for instance, has different meanings in the\ncontexts of classical physics and relativistic physics. Thus, any\njudgment to the effect that the latter\u2019s characterization of\nmass is closer to the truth, or even that the relevant theories\ndescribe the same property, is importantly confused: it equivocates\nbetween two different concepts which can only be understood in an\nappropriately historicized manner, from the perspectives of the\nparadigms in which they occur.\n\nThe changes in perception, conceptualization, and language that Kuhn\nassociated with changes in paradigm also fuelled his notion of world\nchange, which further extends the contrast of the historicist approach\nwith realism. There is an important sense, Kuhn maintained, in which\nafter a scientific revolution, scientists live in a different world.\nThis is a famously cryptic remark in Structure ([1962] 1970:\n111, 121, 150), but he (2000: 264) later gives it a neo-Kantian spin:\nparadigms function so as to create the reality of scientific\nphenomena, thereby allowing scientists to engage with this reality. On\nsuch a view, it would seem that not only the meanings but also the\nreferents of terms are constrained by paradigmatic boundaries. And\nthus, reflecting an interesting parallel with neo-Kantian logical\nempiricism, the idea of a paradigm-transcendent world which is\ninvestigated by scientists, and about which one might have knowledge,\nhas no obvious cognitive content. On this picture, empirical reality\nis structured by scientific paradigms, and this conflicts with the\ncommitment of realism to knowledge of a mind-independent world.\n",
