    "main_text": "Caveat lector\n3. Caveat lector\n\nFirst some preliminary remarks are in order about what we\nare\u2014and are not\u2014discussing. It seems obvious, once stated,\nthat the actual activity of studying animals is different from the\nactivity of writing or teaching about animals based on that study. We\nhave access to a number of Aristotle\u2019s systematically organized\nwritings on animals; we do not have direct access to his\nactual investigations. Some authors studied by historians of science\ndiscuss, in their written work, the methods they used to gather the\ninformation and work out their theoretical ideas and even provide\n\u2018diaries\u2019 describing their day-to-day\nstudies\u2014Aristotle is not one of them. Nor did anyone else report\nobserving Aristotle carrying out his studies. There are reasonable\ninferences we can make from his writings; for example that he\nconsulted with bee-keepers, fishermen and sponge divers, that he (or\nsomeone under his guidance) performed a great many dissections on a\nwide variety of animals, that there were at least some diagrams\nproduced based on these dissections, and so on. Moreover, on the\nquestion of how he reasoned to specific explanations we can\nmake some reasonable inferences from things he says about proper\nmethods of biological inquiry. But it is important to keep in mind\nthat we are studying texts that present, in a highly structured and\ntheoretical manner, the results of an actual investigation,\nthe details of which we know very little.\n\nIt is also unclear what is the intent of the texts we do have\nthat report on these investigations. It is sometimes said they are\n\u2018lecture notes\u2019. That seems pretty clearly wrong; they are\ntoo carefully written and structured. But it does seem clear, from\ncross-references, that some of them were to be studied in a certain\norder, and this order may conform to a course of study in the\nLyceum. Interestingly, while all of the other biological treatises\nrefer for further information to \u2018the animal\ninquiries\u2019,that is to something like the History of\nAnimals that has come down to us, often in conjunction with\n\u2018the dissections\u2019, our History of Animals has no\nreferences to the other, explanatory studies. This suggests that the\n\u2018inquiries and dissections\u2019 had a different function in\nsuch a course of study, perhaps something akin to \u2018reference\nworks\u2019.\n\nFinally, it is also worth recalling that the series of treatises we\nhave was likely compiled hundreds of years after Aristotle\u2019s\ndeath from whatever he left. It seems unlikely we will ever be able to\ndetermine the exact relationship between the so-called\n\u2018Andronican\u2019 edition, the likely source of our texts, and\nwhat was produced during Aristotle\u2019s lifetime.\n\nThese three caveats place constraints on what I can reasonably claim\nto be doing. I will be discussing the treatises that report the\nresults of Aristotle\u2019s investigations of animals. I will assume\nthat the texts that have been passed down to us reflect what he wrote\non this subject, and that the cross-references in those texts are his\nand reflect his own views about how these various studies are related\nto each other.\n\n",
