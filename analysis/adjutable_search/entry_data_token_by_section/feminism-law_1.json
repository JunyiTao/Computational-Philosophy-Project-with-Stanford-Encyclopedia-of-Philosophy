    "main_text": "Fundamental Themes in Feminist Legal Philosophy || The Rule of Law\n1.1 The Rule of Law\n\nMany standard accounts of the nature of law hold that law presumes and\nreflects a world-view in which the goal is to achieve a set of\npresumptively coherent and stable propositions.  Whether this aim\nis understood as \u201cthe rule of law\u201d (see, e.g., the entry\non\n Friedrich Hayek),\n as the \u201cinternal morality of law\u201d (see, e.g., the\ndiscussion of Fuller in the entry on\n natural law theories),\n or as \u201cthe soundest theory of the settled law\u201d (see,\ne.g., the discussion of Dworkin in the entry on\n interpretation and coherence in legal reasoning),\n or in other similar terms, legal systems embody comprehensive and\ngenerally long-standing conceptual systems. The coherence of any\nparticular legal system can always be challenged, but on this approach\nan aspiration of any legal system is coherence. And (at a minimum) the\nappearance or illusion of coherence is maintained by requirements of\nconsistency, including following precedent, treating like cases alike,\nand maintaining judicial impartiality.\n\nFeminist critics point out that conceptualizing the rule of law in\nterms of coherence and consistency tends to reinforce and legitimate\nthe status quo and existing power relationships (Scales 2006;\nMacKinnon 1989). Indeed, one primary purpose of law as traditionally\nunderstood is to promote stability and order by reinforcing adherence\nto predominant norms, representing them not only as the official\nvalues of a society, but even as universal, natural, and inevitable.\nLaw is thus seen as setting the official standard of evaluation for\nwhat is normal and accepted\u2014what is required, prohibited,\nprotected, enabled, or permitted. It is accordingly represented as\nobjective\u2014for example, as compelled by precedent and not just a\nmatter of opinion (see, e.g., MacKinnon 2006, 1989; Smith 2005, 1993;\nRhode 1997; Minow 1991). Violations, wrongs, injustices, harms, or\ninfractions are by definition deviations from law, and typically also\ndeviations from the status quo. The status quo is the invisible\ndefault standard of law. From these observations, feminist\nphilosophers of law have concluded that law makes systemic bias (as\nopposed to personal biases of particular individuals) invisible,\nnormal, entrenched, and thus difficult to identify and to oppose\n(Minow 1991; Rhode 1989; MacKinnon 1989). Such systemic bias may be\naccepted not only by actors within the legal system such as judges but\nalso by its victims as well as its beneficiaries. Primary tasks of\nfeminist philosophy of law are to identify such bias wherever it\noccurs within the legal system, through methodologies such as\ngenealogical analysis, conceptual analysis, or normative critique\n(e.g., Bartlett 1990; MacKinnon 1989).\n\nFeminist philosophers of law judge the status quo thus enforced as\npatriarchal, reflecting ancient and almost universal presumptions of\ngender inequality. This is not a conceptual necessity; law need not be\npatriarchal. Law does, however, reflect power relationships within\nsocieties. Throughout history, and in virtually every society, men and\nwomen have been viewed not only as different, but also as unequal in\nstatus and in power. Women were typically cast as opposites to men\nwithin an overarching set of dichotomies: men considered rational,\naggressive, competitive, political, dominating leaders; and women seen\nas emotional, passive, nurturing, domestic, subordinate followers.\nVersions of this set of assumptions have been widely and pervasively\nincorporated in long-standing institutions from politics and economic\narrangements to educational and religious institutions, to aesthetic\nstandards and personal relations\u2014and law is no exception\n(MacKinnon 2006, 1989; Smith 2005, 1993; Olsen 1983).\n",
