    "main_text": "Biography\n2. Biography\n\nGersonides left few letters and does not talk about himself in his\nwritings; nor is his life discussed at great length by his\ncontemporaries. Hence, what is known of his biography is sketchy at\nbest. Levi ben Gerson was born in 1288 in Provence and may have lived\nfor a time in Bagnol sur-Ceze. It is probable that his father was\nGershom ben Salomon de Beziers, a notable mentioned in medieval\nhistories. With the decline of Spanish Judaism in the thirteenth\ncentury, Provence quickly became the cultural center for Jewish\nintellectual activity. The popes in Avignon had a lenient policy\ntoward the Jews, whose creative life flourished, particularly in\nphilosophy and theology. Jewish philosophers did not have direct\naccess to the works of Aristotle, but Proven\u00e7al Jews learned of\nAristotle through the commentaries of Averroes, the twelfth-century\nSpanish Muslim philosopher. By the end of the thirteenth century these\ncommentaries had been translated from Arabic into Hebrew, and\nAverroes\u2019 thought, as well as that of Aristotle, was being\nintegrated into the mainstream of Jewish philosophy.\n\nGersonides may have married a distant cousin; it is not known whether\nhe had any offspring. Although Gersonides spoke Proven\u00e7al, his\nworks are all written in Hebrew, and all of his quotations from\nAverroes, Aristotle, and Moses Maimonides are in Hebrew as well. He\nmay have had a reading knowledge of Latin; he appears to manifest an\nawareness of contemporary Scholastic discussions. He might, however,\nhave learned of such discussions in oral conversations with his\nChristian contemporaries. Apart from several trips to Avignon,\nGersonides most likely resided his entire life in Orange. There is\nsome evidence that he may have followed the traditional occupation of\nhis family, moneylending. He died on 20 April 1344.\n\nIn addition to Averroes and Aristotle, Gersonides was influenced by\nMoses Maimonides, his greatest Jewish philosophical predecessor.\nGersonides\u2019 works can be seen as an attempt to integrate the\nteachings of Aristotle, as mediated through Averroes and Maimonides,\nwith those of Judaism. In Milhamot Ha-Shem he laid down the\ngeneral rule that \u201cthe Law cannot prevent us from considering to\nbe true that which our reason urges us to believe.\u201d His\nadherence to this principle is reflected throughout his work.\n",
