    "main_text": "Methodology and Epistemology\n5. Methodology and Epistemology\n\nIn earlier sections we considered Dedekind\u2019s overtly foundational\nworks. This led to a discussion of the logicist and metaphysical\nstructuralist views emerging in them. In the last few sections, the\nfocus shifted to his other mathematical contributions and the\nmethodological structuralism they embody. Now we are in a position to\nprovide a more explicit and systematic elaboration of the latter.\nBeyond just calling Dedekind\u2019s approach set-theoretic, infinitary, and\nnon-constructive, the methodology that informs it can be analyzed as\nconsisting of three parts.\n\nThe first part is closely tied to Dedekind\u2019s employment of\nset-theoretic tools and techniques. He uses these to construct new\nmathematical objects (the natural and real numbers, ideals, modules,\netc.) or whole classes of such objects (algebraic number fields,\nrings, lattices, etc.), usually in terms of infinite sets. Closely\nrelated but even more characteristic, both in foundational and other\ncontexts, is the following: These sets are then endowed with general\nstructural features (order relations, arithmetic and other operations,\netc.); and the resulting systems are studied in terms of corresponding\nhigher-level concepts (continuity for the real number system, simple\ninfinity for the natural numbers, unique factorization in algebraic\nnumber fields and function fields, etc.). Once more, philosophically\nrelevant is not just that this procedure is infinitary (his acceptance\nof actual infinities) and non-constructive (the added features are not\nnecessarily grounded in algorithms). A whole variety of relational\nsystems, including many new ones, can now be investigated; and this\nbrings with it a significant extension of the subject matter of\nmathematics. Mathematics is no longer tied to what is given\nintuitively or even empirically (concrete numbers of things, geometric\nmagnitudes, physical processes that are observable, etc.); it has\nbecome the study of relational systems much more generally (based on a\nnew \u201clogic of relations\u201d, \nas Russell and Cassirer will later put it).\n\nThe second characteristic part of Dedekind\u2019s methodology consists of\npersistently (and from early on, cf. Dedekind 1854) attempting to\nidentify and clarify fundamental concepts, including the higher-level\nconcepts just mentioned (continuity, infinity, generalized concepts \nof integer and of prime number, also the\nnew concepts of ideal, module, lattice, etc.). In this context, it is\ncrucial for him to find \u201cthe right \ndefinitions\u201d; and this\ninvolves not just basic adequacy, but also desiderata such as:\nfruitfulness, generality, simplicity, and \n\u201cpurity\u201d, i.e.,\nthe elimination of \u201cforeign\u201d \naspects. (Geometric notions\nare foreign to the natural and real numbers, the definition of prime\nnumber must be at just the right level of generality, etc.). Moreover,\nonce Dedekind has identified them, he studies the most important ones\nalso in themselves, i.e., in terms of a separate part of the theory.\nThis gives his approach a distinctive \n\u201cconceptual\u201d\ncharacter (cf. Stein 1988, Avigad 2006), and it points forward\ntowards an axiomatic approach (Sieg & Schlimm 2014, Schlimm 2017,\nalso Haffner 2014, 2015, 2017)\n\nThe third main part of Dedekind\u2019s approach connects and complements\nthe first two. Not only does he study infinite systems of objects or\nwhole classes of such systems; and not only does he attempt to\nidentify basic concepts applicable to them, especially higher-level\nconcepts. He also tends to do both, often in conjunction, by\nconsidering mappings on the systems studied, especially\nstructure-preserving mappings (homomorphisms, isomorphisms, implicitly\nalso category-theoretic functors, etc.). This implies that what is\ncrucial about a mathematical phenomenon may not lie on the surface\n(concrete features of examples, particular symbolisms, etc.) but go\ndeeper. And while the deeper features are often captured\nset-theoretically (Dedekind cuts, ideals, quotient structures, etc.),\nthis points beyond set theory in the end, towards category theory,\nespecially in Dedekind\u2019s later works (Corry 2004, McLarty 2006,\nFerreir\u00f3s 2017a, 2017b).\n\nThese three parts of Dedekind\u2019s approach may not seem extraordinary to\na contemporary mathematician. But that is just testimony to how much\nmodern mathematics has been shaped by his work. His approach was\ncertainly seen as novel, even revolutionary, at the time. Some\nnegative reactions to it, by finitist and constructivist thinkers,\nhave already been mentioned. The extent to which Dedekind\u2019s approach\ndiverged from what had been common stands out further if we remember\ntwo traditional, widely shared assumptions: that mathematics is the\nscience of number and magnitude; and that it has essentially to do\nwith calculating and other algorithmic procedures. Relative to such\nassumptions, Dedekind\u2019s approach to mathematics involves a radical\ntransformation and liberation (Stein 1988, Tait 1996).\n\nAnother way to bring out the radical character of Dedekind\u2019s work is\nby returning to his treatment of the infinite. It starts with taking\nwhat was long seen as a paradoxical property (to be equinumerous with\na proper subset) to be a defining characteristic of infinite sets.\nDedekind then adds a systematic and wide-ranging analysis of the\nfinite in terms of the infinite, again a rather bold idea. For\nconceptual and methodological innovations like these to become\naccepted, they not only had to open up novel realms for mathematics;\nthe resulting approach also had to lead to progress\nin more traditional realms (as it did: the clarification of continuity\nand of mathematical induction and recursion, results in algebra,\nalgebraic number theory, the theory of algebraic functions, etc.).\n\nWhile Dedekind was a great innovator, he was, of course, not alone in\nmoving large parts of mathematics in a set-theoretic, infinitary, and\nstructuralist direction. There was a whole group of \nmathematicians who promoted a more\n\u201cconceptual\u201d \napproach at the time, including several of\nhis teachers in G\u00f6ttingen. Within that group, Dirichlet has\nsometimes been picked out as the leader, or the \u201cpoet\u2019s\npoet\u201d, among others by being a big influence on Dedekind (Stein\n1988, see also Merzbach 2018). As\nHermann Minkowski, a major figure in this tradition himself, put it\nlater (on the occasion of Dirichlet\u2019s 100th birthday): he impressed on\nother mathematicians \u201cto conquer the problems with a minimum\namount of blind calculation, a maximum of clear-seeing thought\u201d\n(quoted in Stein 1988).\n\nRiemann was another influential figure in this context. He too had a\nstrong influence on Dedekind, in two ways: by emphasizing (in his\ndevelopment of complex function theory) the importance of using\nsimple, characteristic, and \n\u201cintrinsic\u201d concepts, in\ncontrast to \u201cextrinsic\u201d \nproperties tied to, say,\nparticular symbolisms (Mehrtens 1979b, Laugwitz 1999, Tappenden 2005a,\n2006, Ferreir\u00f3s & Reck 2020); \nand by exploring new\n\u201cconceptual possibilities\u201d, \nincluding the systematic study\nof Riemannian geometries (Stein 1988). A further example of such\nconceptual exploration, again very familiar to Dedekind, was the study\nof transfinite ordinal and cardinal numbers by his correspondent\nCantor (Ferreir\u00f3s 1999, chs. 2 and 6). And of course, later\nmathematicians influenced by Dirichlet, Riemann, Dedekind, and Cantor\npushed their innovations further, including Ernst Zermelo, Emmy\nNoether, and Nicolas Bourbaki (Corry 2004, 2017, McLarty 2006, Kahle\n2017).\n\nCan the significance of Dedekind\u2019s methodology be brought out even\nfurther? Or can it be articulated more in different terms? One way to\ndo the latter, already touched on above, is by highlighting the\nmethodological values embodied in it: systematicity, generality,\npurity, etc. (Avigad 2006, also Haffner 2014, 2015, 2017). Another is\nby focusing on the kind of reasoning involved:\n\u201cconceptual\u201d or \u201cstructural\u201d reasoning (Stein\n1988, Ferreir\u00f3s 1999), or in\nterminology often associated with Hilbert, \n\u201caxiomatic\u201d\nreasoning (Sieg & Schlimm 2005, 2017, Schlimm 2000, 2011, 2017).\nWe might even want to talk about a novel \u201creasoning \nstyle\u201d\nin this connection, where \u201cstyle\u201d \nis to be understood in\nan epistemological sense, not in an aesthetic, psychological, or\nsociological sense. Such a style brings with it, not just new theorems\nand proofs, but a distinctive kind of \u201cunderstanding\u201d of\nmathematical facts (Reck 2009, cf. also Tappenden 2005b,\nM\u00fcller-Stach 2017).\n\nThese attempts to reveal the full significance of Dedekind\u2019s approach\nare initial forays and in need of further elaboration. However, one\naspect seems clear enough: The methodological and epistemological\nperspective that shapes Dedekind\u2019s mathematical works is not\nindependent of the logical and metaphysically views emerging in his\nmore foundational writings. This is no accident; if one adopts his\nmethodological stance, it is hardly possible to hold on to narrowly\ncomputational, formalist, empiricist, or intuitionist views about\nmathematics. More specifically, a structuralist methodology along\nDedekindian lines calls for a structuralist metaphysics, as two sides\nof the same coin. Dedekind seems to have been keenly aware of this\nfact, even if he did not elaborate it much in his writings.\n",
