    "main_text": "Arguments Against Compositionality || How Compositionality Might Fail\n4.1 How Compositionality Might Fail\n\nConsider the Algebraic notation for\n chess.[18]\n Here are the basics. The rows of the chessboard are represented by\nthe numerals \\(\\b{1},\\b{2}, \\ldots ,\\b{8}\\); the columns are represented by the\nlower case letters \\(\\ba, \\bb, \\ldots ,\\bh\\). The squares are identified by\ncolumn and row; for example \\(\\b{b5}\\) is at the intersection of the\nsecond column from the left and the fifth row from the top. Upper case\nletters represent the pieces: \\(\\bK\\) stands for king, \\(\\bQ\\) for\nqueen, \\(\\bR\\) for rook, \\(\\bB\\) for bishop, and \\(\\bN\\) for\nknight. Moves are typically represented by a triplet consisting of an\nupper case letter standing for the piece that makes the move and a\nsign standing for the square where the piece moves. There are five\nexceptions to this: (i) moves made by pawns lack the upper case letter\nfrom the beginning, (ii) when more than one piece of the same type\ncould reach the same square, the sign for the square of departure is\nplaced immediately in front of the sign for the square of arrival,\n(iii) when a move results in a capture an \\(\\bx\\) is placed\nimmediately in front of the sign for the square of arrival, (iv) the\nsymbol \\(\\b0\\hy\\b0\\) represents castling on the king\u2019s side, (v)\nthe symbol \\(\\b{0\\hy 0\\hy 0}\\) represents castling on the queen\u2019s\nside. \\(\\bpl\\) stands for check, and \\(\\bpl\\bpl\\) for mate. The rest of the\nnotation serves to make commentaries about the moves and is\ninessential for understanding it.\n\nSomeone who understands the Algebraic notation must be able to follow\ndescriptions of particular chess games in it and someone who can do\nthat must be able to tell which move is represented by\nparticular lines within such a description. Nonetheless, it is clear\nthat when someone sees the line \\(\\b{Bb5}\\) in the middle of such a\ndescription, knowing what \\(\\bB, \\bb\\), and \\(\\b{5}\\) mean will not be\nenough to figure out what this move is supposed to be. It must be a\nmove to \\(\\b{b5}\\) made by a bishop, but we don\u2019t know which bishop\n(not even whether it is white or black) and we don\u2019t know which\nsquare it is coming from. All this can be determined by following the\ndescription of the game from the beginning, assuming that one knows\nwhat the initial configurations of figures are on the chessboard, that\nwhite moves first, and that afterwards black and white move one after\nthe other. But staring at \\(\\b{Bb5}\\) itself will not help.\n\nThe first moral of the example is that we can have productive and\nsystematic understanding of representations even if we do not\nunderstand complex representations merely by understanding\ntheir simple components and the way those components are combined. The\nreason this could happen is that all who understand the system know\ncertain things (e.g., the initial configuration of pieces and the\norder of moves) from which they can figure out the missing information\n(e.g., which figure is moving and from where).\n\nThe second moral is that\u2014given certain assumptions about meaning\nin chess notation\u2014we can have productive and systematic\nunderstanding of representations even if the system itself is not\ncompositional. The assumptions in question are that (i) the\ndescription I gave in the first paragraph of this section fully\ndetermines what the simple expressions of chess notation mean and also\nhow they can be combined to form complex expressions, and that (ii)\nthe meaning of a line within a chess notation determines a move. One\ncan reject (i) and argue, for example, that the meaning of \\(\\bB\\) in\n\\(\\b{Bb5}\\) contains an indexical component and within the context of\na description, it picks out a particular bishop moving from a\nparticular square. One can also reject (ii) and argue, for example,\nthat the meaning of \\(\\b{Bb5}\\) is nothing more than the meaning of\n\u2018some bishop moves from somewhere to square\n\\(\\b{b5}\\)\u2019\u2014utterances of \\(\\b{Bb5}\\) might carry extra\ninformation but that is of no concern for the semantics of the\nnotation. Both moves would save compositionality at a price. The first\ncomplicates considerably what we have to say about lexical meanings;\nthe second widens the gap between meanings of expressions and the\ninformation conveyed by their utterances. Whether saving\ncompositionality is worth either of these costs (or whether there is\nsome other story to be told about our understanding of the Algebraic\nnotation) is by no means clear. For all we know, Algebraic notation\nmight be non-compositional.\n",
