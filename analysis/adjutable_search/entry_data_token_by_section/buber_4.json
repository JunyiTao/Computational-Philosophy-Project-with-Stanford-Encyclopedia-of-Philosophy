    "main_text": "Zionism\n5. Zionism\n\n\nAt the very beginning of his literary career, Buber was recruited by\nthe Budapest-born and Vienna-based journalist Theodor Herzl to edit the\nmain paper of the Zionist party, Die Welt. He soon found a\nmore congenial home in the \u201cdemocratic faction\u201d of\n\u201ccultural Zionists\u201d led by Chaim Weizmann, then living in\nZurich. Buber\u2019s phases of engagement in the movement\u2019s political\ninstitutions alternated with extended phases of disengagement, but he\nnever ceased to write and speak about what he understood to be the\ndistinctive Jewish brand of nationalism. Buber seems to have derived an\nimportant lesson from the early struggles between political and\ncultural Zionism for the leadership and direction of the movement. He\nrealized that his place was not in high diplomacy and political\neducation but in the search for psychologically sound foundations on\nwhich to heal the rift between modern realpolitik and a\ndistinctively Jewish theological-political tradition. Very much in\nkeeping with the nineteenth-century Protestant yearning for a Christian\nfoundation of the nation-state, Buber sought a healing source in the\nintegrating powers of religious experience. After a hiatus of more than\nten years during which Buber spoke to Jewish youth groups (most\nfamously the Prague Bar Kokhba) but refrained from any practical\ninvolvement in Zionist politics, he reentered Zionist debates in 1916\nwhen he began publishing the journal Der Jude, which served as\nan open forum of exchange on any issues related to cultural and\npolitical Zionism. In 1921 Buber attended the Zionist Congress in\nCarlsbad as a delegate of the socialist Hashomer Hatzair (\u201cthe\nyoung guard\u201d). In the debates that followed the first\nanti-Zionist riots in Palestine, Buber joined the Brit Shalom,\nwhich argued for peaceful means of resistance. During the Arab revolt\nof 1936\u201339, when the British government imposed quotas on immigration\nto Palestine, Buber argued for demographic parity rather than trying to\nachieve a Jewish majority. Finally, in the wake of the Biltmore\nConference, Buber (as a member of Ihud) argued for a\nbi-national rather than a Jewish state in Palestine. At any of these\nstages Buber harbored no illusion about the chances of his political\nviews to sway the majority but he believed that it was important to\narticulate the moral truth as one saw it. Needless to say, this\npolitics of authenticity made him few friends among the members of the\nZionist establishment.\n\n\nAt the theoretical core of the Zionism advanced by Buber was a\nconception of Jewish identity that was neither entirely determined by religion nor by nationality, but constituted a unique hybrid. From early on, Buber rejected any state-form for the Jewish people in Palestine. This was clear already in a\nwidely-noted 1916 exchange of letters with the liberal philosopher\nHermann Cohen. Cohen rejected Zionism as incommensurate with the Jewish\nmission of living as a religious minority with the task of maintaining\nthe idea of messianism that he saw as a motor of social and political\nreform within society at large. In contrast, Buber embraced Zionism as\nthe self-expression of a particular Jewish collective that could be\nrealized only in its own land, on its soil, and in its language. The\nmodern state, its means and symbols, however, were not genuinely\nconnected to this vision of a Jewish renaissance. While in the writings\nof the early war years, Buber had characterized the Jews as an oriental\ntype in perpetual motion, in his later writings the Jews represent no\ntype at all. Neither nation nor creed, they uncannily combine what he\ncalled national and spiritual elements. In his letter to Gandhi, Buber\ninsisted on the spatial orientation of Jewish existence and defended\nthe Zionist cause against the critic who saw in it only a form of\ncolonialism. For Buber, space was a necessary but insufficient material\ncondition for the creation of culture based on dialogue. A\nGesamtkunstwerk in its own right, the Zionist project was to\nepitomize the life of dialogue by drawing the two resident nations of\nPalestine into a perfectible common space free from mutual\ndomination.\n",
