Making Sense of Collective Responsibility: Actions, Intentions, and Group Solidarity\n\nAlmost all of those now writing about collective responsibility agree\nthat collective responsibility would make sense if it were merely an\naggregative phenomenon. But they disagree markedly about whether\ncollective responsibility makes sense as a non-distributive\nphenomenon, i.e., as a phenomenon that transcends the contributions of\nparticular group members. In this context, as in many others, skeptics\nset the agenda. Two claims become crucial. The first is that groups,\nunlike individuals, cannot form intentions and hence cannot be\nunderstood to act or to cause harm qua groups. The second is\nthat groups, as distinct from their individual members, cannot be\nunderstood as morally blameworthy in the sense required by moral\nresponsibility.\n\nBoth claims come out of classical methodological individualism of the\nsort articulated by Max Weber (Weber 1914) and H. D. Lewis (Lewis\n1948) in their respective rejections of collective responsibility. In\nEconomy and Society Vol. I, Weber (Weber 1914) argues that\ncollective responsibility makes no sense both because we cannot\nisolate genuinely collective actions, as distinct from identical\nactions of many persons, and because groups, unlike the individuals\nwho belong to them, cannot think as groups or formulate intentions of\nthe kind normally thought to be necessary to actions. H. D. Lewis\nfollows suit in his own arguments and couples his methodological\nindividualism with a sense of moral outrage at the idea of blaming\nindividuals for the actions of others. Lewis writes:\n\nValue belongs to the individual and it is the individual who is the\nsole bearer of moral responsibility. No one is morally guilty except\nin relation to some conduct which he himself considered to be wrong\n\u2026 Collective responsibility is \u2026 barbarous. (Lewis 1948,\npp. 3\u20136)\n\n\nContemporary critics of collective responsibility do not generally go\nas far as Lewis does here in equating collective responsibility with\nbarbarism. But they do generally share their predecessors\u2019\nskepticism about the possibility of both group intentions and\ngenuinely collective actions. (See below.) Likewise, they, too, worry\nabout the fairness of ascribing collective responsibility to\nindividuals who do not themselves directly cause harm or who do not\nbring about harm purposefully. Stephen Sverdlik writes:\n\nIt would be unfair, whether we are considering a result produced by\nmore than one person\u2019s action or by a single person, to blame a\nperson for a result that he or she did not intend to produce.\n(Sverdlik 1987, p. 68)\n\n\nBoth of these claims\u2014that genuinely collective actions are not\npossible and that it would be unfair to consider agents morally\nblameworthy for harm that they did not bring about\npurposively\u2014rest on two normative assumptions that are key to\nthe critic\u2019s position. Both concern the importance of\nintentions. The first is that actions\u2014whether they are\nindividual or collective\u2014necessarily begin with intentions.\n(Otherwise, they are not actions but instead kinds of behavior.) The\nsecond is that moral blameworthiness has its source in and requires\nthe existence of bad intentions\u2014or at least moral\nfaultiness\u2014on the part of those being held responsible.\n\nThe first assumption, namely, that all actions begin with intentions,\nis very useful to critics because it enables them to write group\nintentions into the definition of collective action itself and hence\nrender group intentions a necessary condition of collective\nresponsibility. J. Angelo Corlett\u2019s definition of a collective\naction is typical here. According to Corlett,\n\n[a] collective (intentional) action is an action the subject of which\nis a collective intentional agent. A collective behavior is a\ndoing or behavior that is the result of a collective, though not the\nresult of its intentions. A collective action is caused by\nthe beliefs and desires (wants) of the collective itself, whether or\nnot such beliefs and desires can be accounted for or explained in\nindividualistic terms (Corlett 2001, p. 575).\n\n\nThe second assumption, namely, that moral blameworthiness of all kinds\nis grounded in the bad intentions of moral agents who cause harm, is\nalso very useful to critics of collective responsibility, since it\nenables them to stipulate that collective responsibility requires, not\njust group intentions, but the ability of groups to have bad\nintentions or at least to be morally faulty. How, critics ask, can\ngroups, as distinct from their individual members, be understood to\nhave bad intentions? to be morally faulty? to have a moral character,\nfaulty or not? How, in other words, can they be understood as\nappropriate bearers of moral blameworthiness, guilt, or shame?\n\nA majority of critics here concentrate on showing either that actions\nare associated exclusively with individuals, not groups, or that\ngroups, which do not have minds of their own, cannot make choices or\nhold beliefs in the sense required by the formulation of intentions.\nH. D Lewis concentrates on making both points in his 1948 critique of\ncollective responsibility. So, too, does J. W. N. Watkins (1957).\nLater methodological individualists such as Alvin Goldman (1970),\nStephen Sverdlik (1987), J. Angelo Corlett (Corlett 2001), and Jan\nNarveson (2002), unlike their predecessors, are generally willing to\nacknowledge the sensibility of collective responsibility in a limited\nnumber of cases. But, they, too, draw attention to the host of\ndifficulties that arise for collective responsibility as a moral\nconstruct once we acknowledge the simple fact that collectives do not\nhave full blown mental lives.\n\nCritics of collective responsibility pay somewhat less attention to\nthe nature of collective moral blameworthiness than they do to the\nnature of collective actions. But they do sometimes worry about the\nappropriateness of associating moral blameworthiness with groups, as\ndistinct from group members. R. S. Downie, among others, places what\nturns out to be a very traditional notion of moral responsibility at\nthe center of his attention and argues that\n\n[c]ollectives do not have moral faults, since they don\u2019t make\nmoral choices, and hence they cannot properly be ascribed moral\nresponsibility. \u2026 For there to be moral responsibility there\nmust be blameworthiness involving a morally faulty decision, and this\ncan only occur at the individual level (Downie 1969, p. 67).\n\n\nJan Narveson goes as far in this context as to argue that the bearers\nof moral blameworthiness have to be individuals because only\nindividuals can have moral agency. \u201cNothing else,\u201d\nNarveson writes, \u201ccan literally be the bearer of full\nresponsibility\u201d (Narveson 2002, p. 179). The word\n\u201cliterally\u201d here turns out to be significant for those\nwriting on collective responsibility. For, it contrasts with the sense\nshared by Narveson and others that we might in the end be able to make\nsense of collective responsibility in metaphorical terms by treating\nindividual moral agency, including both agent causation and moral\nblameworthiness, as a metaphor for group agency of the sort relevant\nto moral responsibility traditionally understood.\n\nDefenders of collective responsibility rely on a variety of\nphilosophical strategies to debunk the above claims and to justify\nboth the possibility of collective responsibility in some, if not all,\ncases, and the coherence of collective responsibility as an\nintellectual construct. One of these strategies has been simply to\npoint out both that we blame groups all the time in practice and that\nwe do so in a way that is difficult to analyze with the precepts of\nmethodological individualism. David Cooper, among others, uses this\nstrategy to great effect in his own defense of collective\nresponsibility. According to Cooper, \u201c[t]here is an obvious\npoint to be recognized and that obvious point is that responsibility\nis ascribed to collectives, as well as to individual persons. Blaming\nattitudes are held towards collective as well as towards\nindividuals,\u201d (Cooper 1968, p. 258.)\n\nDeborah Tollefsen (Tollefsen, 2003) zeros in on the fact that we\nexpress various reactive attitudes to groups, e.g., anger, resentment,\nand moral indignation. How, she asks, can we make sense of these\nattitudes? She argues that we cannot do so by simply positing that our\nemotions are misfiring here or that our attitudes are really directed\nat group members rather than at groups themselves. Instead, we have to\nrecognize that, within our practices of moral responsibility (a\nl\u00e0 Strawson), groups have the ability of moral address and\nexhibit moral competence.\n\nBut of course our practices of moral responsibility, as well as the\nreactive attitudes that ground them, may not be justified. Cooper\nhimself acknowledges that both our use of language here and our\nblaming attitudes may be misguided. Hence, they find it necessary to\nshow, not just that we ascribe blame to collectives in practice, but\nthat the collective blame that we ascribe cannot be analyzed in terms\nof individual blame. Cooper himself takes on this project by exploring\nparticular cases of blame, e.g., those associated with sports clubs\nand nations, that, he argues, can only attach to groups. According to\nCooper, when we look at how such collectives act, we see that whether\nwe regard statements about collectives as propositional functions or\nnot, we cannot deduce from them statements about particular\nindividuals. \u201cThis is so,\u201d he argues, \u201cbecause the\nexistence of a collective is compatible with varying membership. No\ndeterminate set of individuals is necessary for the existence of the\ncollective\u201d (Cooper 1968, p. 260).\n\nIn a similar vein, Peter French focuses on that class of predicates\nthat, he contends, can only be true of collectives. According to\nFrench,\n\n[t]here is a class of predicates that just cannot be true of\nindividuals, that can only be true of collectives. Examples of such\npredicates abound \u2026 and include \u2018disbanded\u2019 (most\nuses of), \u2018lost the football game\u2019, \u2018elected a\npresident\u2019, and \u2018passed an amendment\u2019. \u2026\nMethodological individualism would be at a loss in this context.\n(French 1998, p. 37)\n\n\nA majority of those who defend the possibility of group actions in\nthis context rely on linguistic analyses. But there are also those\nwho, like Larry May, turn instead to social theory and to the\nexistentialist tradition. May himself uses the relational theory of\nJean-Paul Sartre to argue that groups can legitimately be ascribed\nactions in cases where individuals are related to one another and act\nin ways together that would not be possible if they acted alone. May\nsets down two relationally-based conditions under which we can\nlegitimately say of an action that it is collective rather than\nindividual\u2014which for May means, not trans-individual, but\nrelational. The first condition is that the individuals in question be\nrelated to each other so as to enable each to act in ways that they\ncould not manage on their own. The second is that some individuals be\nauthorized to represent their own actions as the actions of the group\nas a whole (May 1987, p. 55).\n\nWhat about group intentions? Not surprisingly, group intentions\npresent an even greater challenge than group actions do. For,\nintentions are mental states and hence not the kinds of things that\nare normally thought to be shareable. Are they shareable?\n\nAccording to Brook Sadler and others, the question is inherently\npuzzling. For, \u201cif intentions are mental states, states which\nplay a fundamental role in an agent\u2019s practical deliberation and\nvolition, the prospect of a shared intention introduces the specter of\nshared mental states and hence shared minds\u201d\u2014which is\nsomething that philosophers have traditionally hoped to leave behind.\n(Sadler 2006, p.115.)\n\nIndeed, the possibility that collective responsibility requires, not\nonly collective actions and intentions, but a collective mind, has\nproven to be one of the greatest challenges to those who want to\nsustain a notion of collective responsibility. For while groups can\nlegitimately be said to have beliefs and other states characteristic\nof a mind in particular cases, e.g., when the group is organized\naround such beliefs, they do not seem to have minds in any sense other\nthan their ability to build on the minds of individual members. As\nDavid Sosa argues, \u201cgroups might be said to have a mind or a\nwill but only in a derivative sense: the persons that are members of\nthe group have minds, and the group\u2019s mind (in whatever sense it\nhas one, its beliefs and desires) is some sort of construct from those\nminds\u201d (Sosa 2007, p. 215).\n\nNot surprisingly, the matter of consciousness becomes key here.\nMatthew Baddorf (2017) argues straightforwardly that for something to\nhave a mind, it must be phenomenologically conscious and, and\naccording to Baddorf, collectives lack consciousness. Baddorf is\nwilling to go as far as to conclude here that lacking such\nconsciousness, collectives are inappropriate sites of accountability\nand responsibility. But not everyone is willing to go so far.\n\nIndeed, there are an increasing number of scholars in the field who\nwonder whether we really need to talk about a collective mind (or\nconsciousness)\u2014or even a unified self\u2014in order to sustain\na notion of collective moral responsibility. Michael Bratman appears\nto have developed a coherent view of collective intentions that does\nnot require us to go that far. According to Bratman, we can talk about\ncollective intentions as intentions that are shared among group\nmembers.\n\n[w]e intend to do J if and only if: (1)(a) I intend that we J\nand (b) you intend that we J and (2) I intend that we J in accordance\nwith and because of (1)(a), (1)(b) and meshing sub-plans of (1)(a),\n(1)(b), and you intend likewise. (3):(1) and (2) are common knowledge\nbetween us. (Bratman 1999:121)\n\n\nIn Shared Agency: A Planning Theory of Acting Together\n(Bratman 2014), Bratman associates these shared intentions with a\npattern of ordinary intentions and beliefs that coordinates multiple\nindividuals\u2019 activity in a fashion analogous to the way in which\nan individual\u2019s intention coordinates her activity through time.\nHere, again, Bratman presents shared intentions as a matter of\n\u201cmeshing subplans.\u201d According to Bratman, to say that we\nhave a \u201cshared intention to J,\u201d where J is a joint\nactivity, is to say that \u201c[w]e each have intentions that we J,\nand we each intend that we J by way of each of our intentions that we\nJ and by way of subplans that mesh.\u201d (Bratman 2014, p. 103)\n\nTwo things are important to underscore here. First of all, Bratman is\nnot concerned to account for a collective mind. Instead, he is\nconcerned to account for collective intentions. Second, while he\nsuggests in Shared Agency: A Planning Theory of Acting\nTogether that we can think of shared activity as the activity of\na group agent, he makes clear that he is not positing a group subject\nof the kind necessary to the ascription of moral blameworthiness to\nthe group itself qua moral agent.\n\nBoth points together suggest that while Bratman\u2019s theory\nprovides us with a very helpful way of understanding both collective\nintentions and coordinated activities of various kinds, as well as a\nbasis for grasping the nature of shared deliberation and shared\nreasoning, it does not attach those collective intentions to the kind\nof collective moral agent that is required of moral responsibility.\nNor does it establish the kind of moral agent in question.\n\nBratman was not himself interested in establishing this kind of moral\nagent in his theory of collective intentions. But, if we want to talk\nabout collective moral responsibility, we will have to do so.\nMoreover, we will have to do so regardless of our stance on the\npossibility of a collective mind or a collective consciousness. (In\nother words, we will have to do so regardless of what other conditions\nof collective moral responsibility we posit and whether we think that\nthese conditions can be met.) For, responsibility of all kinds\nrequires the location of agents and moral responsibility requires that\nthese agents be appropriate sites of blameworthiness.\n\nHow, if at all, might we talk about the kind of collective moral agent\nand/or unified collective moral subject required by collective moral\nresponsibility? Interestingly enough, defenders of collective\nresponsibility frequently turn back here to the works of Durkheim\n(1895) and Simmel (1971), as well as to that of Sartre (1960), for\ninspiration, although they themselves proceed analytically. Margaret\nGilbert, who grounds several of her arguments in Durkheim\u2019s\ntheory of social facts, develops what she calls a\n\u201cplural-subject account\u201d of shared intentions to justify\nthe coherence of collective responsibility (Gilbert 1989, 2000, 2006\nand 2013) (Gilbert and Priest 2020). She does so in large part by\nzeroing in on joint commitments. According to Gilbert, group\nintentions exist when two or more persons constitute the plural\nsubject of an intention to carry out a particular action, or, in other\nwords, when \u201cthey are jointly committed to intending as a body\nto do A\u201d (Gilbert 2000, p. 22).\n\nDavid Velleman goes on to stress the unified nature of this plural\nsubject. A \u201ctruly plural subject\u201d, he writes, involves\n\u201ctwo or more subjects who combine in such a way as to make one\nsubject\u201d (Velleman 1997). Both Gilbert and Velleman make clear\nthat a unified moral subject is required of a collective moral\nresponsibility.\n\nWhile Gilbert and Velleman provide us with a compelling view of a\nplural subject, two questions remain. Does their plural subject\nconstitute a unified moral subject of the kind that can be morally\nblameworthy for bringing about harm? If so, is the kind of moral\nblameworthiness associated with such a unified moral subject the same\nin the case of a collective as it is in the case of individual moral\nagents? We address these questions in Section 5.\n\nSuffice it to point out here both that (as Gilbert herself recognizes)\nsuch a unified moral subject is necessary to collective moral\nresponsibility and that the location of a plural subject is not the\nonly way of making sense of a collective moral agent. Raimo Tuomela\n(1989, 2005, 2006 and 2013) chooses a somewhat different strategy in\nhis defense of collective responsibility. He puts forward what he\ncalls \u201cwe intentions.\u201d Like Gilbert, he constructs a\ncollective subject on the basis of joint commitments and then applies\nit to the notion of collective responsibility. But he does not, like\nGilbert, stress the pluralistic nature of this subject. Instead, he\nargues that collective intentional agency supervenes on\nindividual intentional agency in ways that allow us to talk about both\ncollective intentions and collective actions. According to Tuomela,\nactions by collectives supervene on the actions of the\noperative members of the collective in such a way that the properties\nof particular collectives, such as their intentions, beliefs, and\ndesires, are \u201cembodied in\u201d and \u201cdetermined by\u201d\nthe perspectives of the properties of individual members or\nrepresentatives of the collective in question (Tuomela 1989, p.\n494).\n\nInterestingly enough, Tuomela\u2019s attempt here to save collective\nresponsibility by positing such a representative subject recalls the\nefforts of Thomas Hobbes to create a collective subject in the guise\nof his Leviathan (1651). Hobbes, in an effort both to explain\nsovereignty in general and to justify the legitimacy of the English\nmonarchy in particular, posited a higher authority in the\ncommunity\u2014the Leviathan\u2014whose own will, as well as\nactions, came to be those of its/his subjects as a result of their\nhaving transferred their own agency to it/him as part of the only kind\nof social contract that from Hobbes\u2019s perspective made\ncollective life possible. Hobbes\u2019s collective subject not only\nrepresented group members but captured their very being as members of\nhis Leviathan.\n\nContemporary defenders of collective responsibility sometimes recall\nHobbes\u2019s Leviathan in their own attempt to develop a collective\nsubject (see for example: Copp 1980). But they do not, in light of\nHobbes\u2019s own authoritarianism, go as far as to accept\nHobbes\u2019s argument that a Leviathan is necessary to capture the\ncollective will. Nor do they generally toy with the possibility of\nreintroducing the seemingly more benevolent general will of Rousseau\n(1762) as a way of substantiating group intentions. Instead, they look\nfor an alternative, less authoritarian, way of substantiating group\nintentions\u2014representational or not\u2014or else argue that\ngroup intentions of the sort associated with traditional Kantian\nnotions of moral agency are not after all necessary to collective\nmoral responsibility.\n\nLarry May offers one of the most interesting arguments of the latter\nsort in his own defense of collective moral agency (May 1987, 2006 and\n2010). May rejects many of the above accounts of group intentions as\ntoo closely tied to Kantian notions of moral agency. But he does not\ndo away with group intentions as a necessary condition of collective\nresponsibility. Nor does he accept a fully collectivist methodology.\nInstead, he reformulates group intentions within a theory of what he\ncalls interdependence and, in doing so, develops a general outlook on\ncollective responsibility that not only combines individualism and\ncollectivism but places both relationships and social structures at\nthe center of our attention. The challenge here becomes to describe\nwhat such group intentions actually look like.\n\nMay relies in this context once again on the work of Sartre to develop\nhis account of group intentions and posits what he calls a\n\u201cpre-reflective intention\u201d, i.e., \u201can intention\nwhich is not yet reflected upon by each of the members of the\ngroup\u201d (May 1987 p. 64). May makes clear here that group\nintentions of this sort arise out of the relationships between\nparticular members of a group rather than from any one group member.\nHence, while they are not trans-individual or collective in any sense\nthat stands totally above individuals, they can be treated \u201cas\nif they are collective\u201d (May 1987, p. 64) Moreover, these\nintentions are, May makes clear, not individual intentions\nbut group-based. \u201cSince each member of the group comes\nto have the same intention, either reflectively or\npre-reflectively\u201d, it is \u201cdifferent from their individual\nintentions.\u201d Indeed, \u201cthe sameness of intention is\ncollective in the sense that it is caused by the group structure, that\nis, it is group-based\u201d (May 1987, p. 65). The question for May,\nas for the others, is whether the \u201csameness of intention\u201d\nis sufficient for talking about a collective moral agent worthy of\nblame.\n\nWhile many of those defending the possibility of collective moral\nresponsibility do not explore the conditions of collective moral\nblameworthiness, List and Pettit (2011), in an important work on the\nsubject, extend inquiry about collective moral agency into the realm\nof ethical, political, and legal accountability. List and Pettit argue\nthat groups can meet the requirements of moral agency by virtue of the\nfact that they \u201chave representational states, motivational\nstates, and a capacity to process them and act on their basis.\u201d\n(List and Pettit 2011, p. 21) Likewise, they argue that groups can\nhave obligations, entitlements, and power relations that have hitherto\ngone unnoticed and that require our moral attention.\n\nList and Pettit devote a great deal of their own attention to how we\nmight use our recognition of these obligations, entitlements, and\npower relations to re-work various institutions in contemporary\nsociety. But they do not neglect the question of collective moral\nblameworthiness. Nor do they simply assume that such blameworthiness\nfollows automatically from group moral agency. Instead they make clear\nthat in order for a group to be morally blameworthy, its actions must\nbe associated with a \u201cgrave matter\u201d; the group must have\n\u201cfull knowledge of guilt\u201d; and there must have been\n\u201cfull consent of the will\u201d (List and Pettit 2011, 155).\nList and Pettit think that these conditions can be met by at least\nsome groups. Are they right?\n\nWhile they provide convincing evidence that at least some groups can\nmeet the first two conditions, we need, once again, to be worried\nabout the third, i.e., that which pertains to the willfulness or\ncontrol of a collective agent. In their own words, \u201cthe question\nraised by the third condition is whether a group agent is in control\nover the actions it takes so that we might expect its normative\njudgment, for example, to be capable of impacting on its\nbehavior\u201d (List and Pettit, 2011, 159). How can a group, above\nits individual members, exert this level of control?\n\nList and Pettit do not answer this question. Instead, they point out\n(correctly) that the question is not more serious for groups than it\nis for individuals.\n\nThis notion of control needs analysis in any full theory of agency,\nbut since the issue arises with individual agency as much as it does\nwith group agency, we need not provide that analysis here. The\nchallenge for us is not to explain what an agent\u2019s control is,\nbut rather to show that there is no special reason why such control,\nwhatever it involves, shouldn\u2019t be instantiated in a group agent\nas much as in an individual. (List and Pettit, 2011, 159)\n\n\nBut if we are going to justify the possibility of group moral\nblameworthiness, we cannot be satisfied with simply knowing that the\nmatter of control is no more serious for groups than it is for\nindividuals. Instead, we have to know what group control entails in\nthis context and whether it is possible. In other words, we have to\ndevelop the kind of explanation of group control that List and Pettit\nconcede is important, as well as an account of the \u201cwhatever\nsuch control involves\u201d that they cite.\n\nThere have been several interesting efforts in recent years to\narticulate and justify such a notion of group control. Kendy Hess, in\n\u201cThe Free Will of Corporations and Other Collectives\u201d\n(Hess, 2014) argues that collectives possess free will to the extent\nthat they act from their own \u201cactional springs\u201d and from\ntheir own \u201creasons-responsive mechanisms\u201d. Hess argues\nthat when collectives do so, they both act freely and are morally\nresponsible for what they do.\n\nKenneth Silver (2022) follows through on the reasons-responsive\napproach to group free will and moral responsibility. According to\nSilver, while it is difficult to establish a group mind or mental\nstate in this context, to do so is not necessary. Instead, we need\nonly establish that groups are sensitive to their reasons and can be\nmotivated to act by them. In Section 5, I address whether such a\nnotion of group control is sufficient to sustain ascriptions of moral\nblameworthiness.\n\nWhile List and Pettit do not provide us with their own notion of group\ncontrol (leaving the question of group moral blameworthiness still up\nin the air), they do make two related points of importance. The first\nis that control in this context does not need to reside in the group\nor in individuals. Instead, it can reside simultaneously in\nboth places, albeit in different forms: \u201cprogramming\ncauses\u201d vs. \u201cimplementing causes\u201d (List and Pettit,\n2011, p. 162).\n\nThe second is that we need to think, not only about whether groups are\nmorally responsible for harm, but about whether we should\nhold them morally responsible for harm and, if so, under what\nconditions. List and Pettit do not take a wholly consequentialist\napproach to the latter matter themselves. But they do underscore the\npositive consequences that can follow from our holding groups\nmorally responsible in particular cases, consequences that range from\nour \u201crecognition... of the true contours of the moral and\npolitical world we inhabit\u201d (List and Pettit 2011, p. 185) to\nthe persuasion of group members to give up harmful behaviors to the\nsocialization of group members to act more responsibly in the future.\nWe discuss these and other consequences more fully in Section 6.\n",
