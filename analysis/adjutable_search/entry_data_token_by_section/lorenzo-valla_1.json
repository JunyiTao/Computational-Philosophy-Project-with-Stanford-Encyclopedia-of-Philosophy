    "main_text": "Valla\u2019s Critique of Scholastic Philosophy\n2. Valla\u2019s Critique of Scholastic Philosophy\n\nIn his Repastinatio dialectice et philosophie, which is\nextant in three versions with slightly different titles, Valla attacks\nwhat he sees as the foundations of scholastic-Aristotelian philosophy\nand sets out to transform Aristotelian dialectic. As the title of the\nfirst version clearly indicates, he wants to \u201cre-plough\u201d\nthe ground traditionally covered by the Aristotelian scholastics. The\nterm repastinatio means not only \u201cre-ploughing\u201d\nor \u201cre-tilling\u201d but also \u201ccutting back\u201d and\n\u201cweeding out.\u201d Valla desires to weed out everything he\nregards as barren and infertile in scholastic thought and to\nre-cultivate the ground by sprinkling it with the fertile waters of\nrhetoric and grammar. His use of repastinatio indicates that\nhe is setting out a program of reform rather than of destruction, in\nspite of his often aggressive and polemical tone. Book I is devoted\nmainly to metaphysics, but also contains chapters on natural\nphilosophy and moral philosophy, as well a controversial chapter on\nthe Trinity. In Books II and III Valla discusses propositions and\nforms of argumentation such as the syllogism.\n\nHis main concern in the first book is to simplify the\nAristotelian-scholastic apparatus. For Valla, the world consists of\nthings, simply called res. Things have qualities and do or\nundergo things (which he refers to as \u201cthings\u201d). Hence,\nthere are three basic categories: substance, quality, and action. At\nthe back of Valla\u2019s mind are the grammatical categories of noun,\nadjective, and verb; but in many places he points out that we cannot\nassume that, for instance, an adjective always refer to a quality or a\nverb to an action (Repastinatio, 1:134\u2013156;\n425\u2013442; DD 1:240\u201380). These three categories are the\nonly ones Valla admits; the other Aristotelian categories of accidents\nsuch as place, time, relation and quantity can all be reduced to\nquality or action. Here, too, grammar plays a leading role in\nValla\u2019s thought. From a grammatical point of view, qualities\nsuch as being a father, being in the classroom, or being six-feet tall\nall tell us something about how a particular man is qualified; and\nthere is, consequently, no need to preserve the other Aristotelian\ncategories.\n\nIn reducing the categories to his triad of substance, quality, and\naction, Valla does not seem to have in mind \u201crealist\u201d\nphilosophers who accepted the independent existence of entities such\nas relations and quantities over and above individual things. Instead,\nhis aim is to show that many terms traditionally placed in other\ncategories, in fact, point to qualities or actions: linguistic usage\n(loquendi consuetudo) teaches us, for example, that\nquality is the overarching category. Thus, to the question \u201cof\nwhat kind\u201d, we often give answers containing quantitative\nexpressions. Take, for instance, the question: what sort of horse\nshould I buy? It may be answered: erect, tall, with a broad chest, and\nso on. Valla\u2019s reduction of the categories often assumes the\nform of grammatical surveys of certain groups of words associated with\na particular category: thus, in his discussion of time, he studies\nwords like \u201cday,\u201d \u201cyear,\u201d and a host of\nothers; and his discussion of quantitative words treats mathematical\nterms such as line, point and circle. Of course, Valla does not deny\nthat we can speak of quantity or time or place. But the rich array of\nLatin terms signify, in the final analysis, the qualities or actions\nof things, and nothing exists apart from concrete things. (Substance\nis a shady category for Valla, who says that he cannot give an example\nof it, much as Locke was later to maintain that \u201ca substance is\nsomething I know not what\u201d).\n\nIt is tempting to connect this lean ontology to that of William of\nOckham (c. 1287\u20131347). The interests, approach and arguments of\nthe two thinkers, however, differ considerably. Unlike Valla, Ockham\ndoes not want to get rid of the system of categories. As long as one\nrealizes, Ockham says, that categories do not describe things in the\nworld but categorize terms by which we signify real\nsubstances or real inhering qualities in different ways, the\ncategories can be maintained and the specific features of, for\nexample, relational or quantitative terms can be explored. Thus,\nOckham\u2019s rejection of a realist interpretation of the categories\nis accompanied by a wish to defend the categories as distinct\ngroups of terms. Valla, on the other hand, sees the categories as\nsumming up the real aspects of things: hence, there are only\nsubstances, qualities, and actions, and his reductive program consists\nin showing that we have a vast and rich vocabulary in Latin that we\ncan use for referring to these things. His questions about words and\nclasses of words are not unlike those of Priscian (fl. 500\u2013530)\nand other grammarians. (Priscian, for instance, had stated that a noun\nsignifies substance plus quality, and pronouns substance without\nquality.)\n\nAnother good example of Valla\u2019s reduction of scholastic\nterminology, distinctions, and concepts is his critique of the\ntranscendental terms (Repastinatio 1:11\u201321; DD\n1:18\u201336). According to Valla, the traditional six\nterms\u2014\u201cbeing,\u201d \u201cthing,\u201d\n\u201csomething,\u201d \u201cone,\u201d \u201ctrue,\u201d and\n\u201cgood\u201d\u2014should be reduced to \u201cthing\u201d\n(Latin res) since everything that exists, including a quality\nor an action of a thing (also called a \u201cthing\u201d) is a\nthing. A good thing, for example, is a thing, and so, too, is a true\nthing. From a grammatical point of view, such terms as\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d are adjectives, and when\nused as substantives (the good, the one), they refer to qualities;\nhence, there is nothing \u201ctranscendental\u201d about them.\nValla\u2019s grammatical approach is evident in his rejection of the\nscholastic term ens. Just as \u201crunning\u201d\n(currens) can be resolved into \u201che who runs\u201d\n(is qui currit), so \u201cbeing\u201d (ens) can be\nresolved into \u201cthat which is\u201d (id quod est).\n\u201cThat,\u201d however, is nothing other than \u201cthat\nthing\u201d (ea res); so we get as a result the\nlaborious formula: \u201cthat thing which is\u201d.\n(Repastinatio 1:14; DD 1:23\u201325.) We do not, however,\nneed the phrase \u201cthat which is\u201d (ea que est):\n\u201ca stone is a being\u201d (lapis est ens), or the\nequivalent phrase into which it can be resolved, \u201ca stone is a\nthing which is\u201d (lapis est res que est), are unclear,\nawkward, and absurd ways of saying simply that \u201ca stone is a\nthing\u201d (lapis est res). Valla also rejects other\nscholastic terms such as entitas (\u201centity\u201d),\nhecceitas (\u201cthis-ness\u201d) and quidditas\n(\u201cquidity\u201d) for grammatical reasons: these terms do not\nconform to the rules of word formation in Latin. While he is not\nagainst the introduction of new words for things unknown in antiquity\n(e.g., bombarda for \u201ccannonball\u201d), the\nterminology coined by the scholastics is a different matter\nentirely.\n\nRelated to this analysis is Valla\u2019s repudiation of what he\npresents as the scholastic view of the distinction between abstract\nand concrete terms, that is, the view that abstract terms\n(\u201cwhiteness,\u201d \u201cfatherhood\u201d) always refer\nsolely to quality, while concrete terms (\u201cwhite,\u201d\n\u201cfather\u201d) refer to both substance and quality\n(Repastinatio, 1:21\u201330; DD 1:36\u201354). In a\ncareful discussion of this distinction, taking into account the\ngrammatical categories of case, number, and gender, Valla rejects the\nontological commitments which such a view seems to imply, and shows,\non the basis of a host of examples drawn from classical Latin usage,\nthat abstract terms often have the same meaning as their concrete\ncounterparts (useful/utility, true/truth, honest/honesty). These terms\nrefer to the concrete thing itself, that is, to the substance, its\nquality or action (or a combination of these three components into\nwhich a thing can be resolved). Again, Valla\u2019s main concern is\nto study the workings of language and how these relate to the world of\neveryday things, the world that we see and experience.\n\nIn describing and analyzing this world of things Valla is not only\nguided by grammatical considerations. He also uses \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d and the limits of our imagination as yardsticks against\nwhich to measure scholastic notions and definitions. He thus thinks\nthat it is ridiculous to imagine prime matter without any form or form\nwithout any matter, or to define a line as that which has no width and\na point as an indivisible quantity that occupies no space.\nValla\u2019s idea is that notions such as divisibility and quantity\nare properly at home only in the world of ordinary things. For him,\nthere is only the world of bodies with actual shapes and dimensions;\nlines and points are parts of these things, but only, as he seems to\nsuggest, in a derivative sense, in other words, as places or spaces\nthat are filled by the body or parts of that body. If we want to\nmeasure or sketch a (part of a) body, we can select two spots on it\nand measure the length between them by drawing points and lines on\npaper or in our mind, a process through which these points and lines\nbecome visible and divisible parts of our world\n(Repastinatio, 1:142\u2013147; 2:427\u2013431; DD\n254\u201364). But it would be wrong to abstract from this diagramming\nfunction and infer a world of points and lines with their own\nparticular quantity. They are merely aids for measuring or outlining\nbodies. In modern parlance, Valla seems to be saying that ontological\nquestions about these entities\u2014do they exist? how do they\nexist?\u2014amount to category mistakes, equivalent to asking the\ncolor of virtue.\n\nThe appeal to common sense (or what Valla considers as such) informs\nhis critique of Aristotelian natural philosophy. He insists on\ncommonplace observations and experiences as criteria for testing ideas\nand hypotheses. On this basis, many of Aristotle\u2019s contentions,\nso Valla argues, are not true to the facts (Repastinatio,\n1:98\u2013112; DD 1:174\u201399). He rejects or qualifies a\nnumber of fundamental tenets of Aristotelian physics, for instance\nthat movement is the cause of heat, that a movement is always caused\nby another movement, that elements can be transformed into one\nanother, that each has its own proper qualities (heat and dryness for\nfire, heat and humidity for air, etc.), that there are pure elements,\nthat the combination of heat and humidity is a sufficient condition\nfor the generation of life, and so forth. Valla often uses\nreductio ad absurdum as an argumentative strategy: if\nAristotle\u2019s theory is true, one would expect to observe\nphenomena quite different from the ones we do, in fact, observe. In\narguing, for instance, for the existence of a fiery sphere below the\nmoon, Aristotle had claimed that \u201cleaden missiles shot out by\nforce melt in the air\u201d (De caelo II.7,\n289a26\u201328). Valla rejects this claim by appealing to ordinary\nexperience: we never see balls\u2014whether leaden, iron, or stone,\nshot out of a sling or a cannon\u2014heat up in the air; nor do the\nfeathers of arrows catch fire. If movement is sufficient to produce\nheat, the spheres would set the air beneath in motion; but no one has\never observed this. Arguably, the importance of Valla\u2019s polemic\nhere is not so much the quality of his arguments as the critical\ntendency they reveal, the awareness that Aristotle\u2019s conclusions\noften do not conform to daily experience. While he does not develop\nhis critique in the direction of an alternative natural philosophy as\nlater Renaissance philosophers such as Bernardino Telesio\n(1509\u20131588) and Francesco Patrizi of Cherso (1529\u20131597)\nwould do, Valla contributed to undermining faith in the exclusive\nvalidity of the Aristotelian paradigm.\n\nValla also criticizes Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy because,\naccording to him, it detracts from God\u2019s power. In strongly\npolemical terms, he attacks Aristotle for his\n\u201cpolytheistic\u201d ideas and for what Valla sees as his\nequation of God with nature (Repastinatio, 1:54\u201359;\nDD 1:94\u2013103). Valla wants to reinstate God as the sole\ncreator of heaven and earth. To think of the cosmos in terms of a\nliving animal or the heavens in terms of celestial orbs moved by\nintelligences is anathema to Valla (as it was to many medieval\nscholastics as well). The notion of God as First Mover is also\nrejected, since movement and rest are terms which should not be\napplied (except perhaps metaphorically) to spiritual beings such as\nGod, angels, and souls.\n\nReligious considerations also led Valla to find fault with another\nfundamental tenet of Aristotelian scholastic thought: the Tree of\nPorphyry (Repastinatio, 1:46\u201350; 2:389\u2013391;\nDD 1:82\u201388). Valla has several problems with the Tree. First\nof all, it puts substance, rather than thing, on top. For Valla,\nhowever, pure substance does not exist, since a thing is always\nalready a qualified substance. He also thinks that there is no place\nfor a human being in the Tree of Porphyry. Since the Tree divides\nsubstance into the corporeal and the spiritual, it is difficult to\nfind a place for a human being, consisting of both soul and body.\nMoreover, the Tree covers both the divine and the created order, which\nleads to inappropriate descriptions of God and angels, to which the\nterm \u201canimal\u201d should not be applied, since they do not\nhave a body. Valla, therefore, divides Porphyry\u2019s Tree into\nthree different trees: one for spiritual substance, one for corporeal\nsubstance, and one for what he calls \u201canimal,\u201d that is,\nthose creatures which consist of both body and soul\n(Repastinatio, 1:49\u201350; 2:422\u2013424; DD\n1:88). One might argue that what Valla gains over Porphyry by\ndisentangling the supernatural from the natural order, he loses by\nhaving to admit that he cannot place Christ in any of his three trees,\nsince he is not only human but also God.\n\nThe soul as an incorporeal substance is treated by Valla in a separate\nchapter (Repastinatio, 1:59\u201373; 2:408\u2013410;\n418\u2013419; DD 1:104\u201329). Rejecting the Aristotelian\nhylomorphic account, he returns to an Augustinian picture of the soul\nas a wholly spiritual and immaterial substance made in the image of\nGod, and consisting of memory, intellect, and will. He rejects without\nmuch discussion the various functions of the soul (vegetative,\nsensitive, imaginative, intellectual), which would entail, he thinks,\na plurality of souls. He briefly treats the five exterior senses but\nis not inclined to deal with the physiological aspects of sensation.\nThe term \u201cspecies\u201d (whether sensible or intelligible) does\nnot occur at all. The Aristotelian sensus\ncommunis\u2014which the medieval commentary tradition on\nDe anima had viewed as one of the internal senses,\nalongside imagination (sometimes distinguished from\nphantasia), memory, and the vis aestimativa\n(foresight and prudence)\u2014is mentioned only to be rejected\nwithout further argument (Repastinatio, 1:73; DD\n1:128). Imagination and the vis aestimativa are absent from\nValla\u2019s account, while memory, as the soul\u2019s principal\ncapacity, appears to have absorbed all the functions which scholastics\nhad divided among separate faculties of the sensitive soul. What may\nhave provoked Valla\u2019s anger about the traditional picture is the\nseemingly passive role allotted to the soul in perception and\nknowledge: it seems to come only at the very end of a long chain of\ntransmission, which starts with outer objects and concludes with a\nmerely receptive tabula rasa. In his view, the soul is far\nmore noble than the hylomorphic account of Aristotle implies, at least\nas Valla understands that account. He therefore stresses on various\noccasions the soul\u2019s dignified nature, its immortality, unity,\nautonomy, and superiority to both the body and the animal soul,\ncomparing it to the sun\u2019s central place in the cosmos.\n",
