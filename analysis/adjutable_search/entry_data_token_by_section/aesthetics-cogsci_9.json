    "main_text": "Aesthetics and Evolution\n10. The Aesthetics of the Environment\n\nWe have referred rather briefly to the aesthetics of the natural and\nhumanly constructed environment and we conclude with a brief selection\nof aesthetically and cognitively relevant work in this area. Much of\nthis discussion continues the evolutionary theme. Note that some of\nthis work relies for its evidence on people\u2019s responses to\npictures of environments rather than to the environments themselves,\nleaving it uncertain how much of the response is to the environment\nand how much to its representation.\n\nThe empirical study of environmental preferences has long been of\ninterest to planners, and largely represents the bottom-up mode of\ninquiry referred to above (see\n Section 2),\n as the aim is to discover what people in general like rather than to\nassess their likings against the normative constraints of connoisseurs\nand philosophers. Topics explored include the differences in\npreference across age groups, ethnicity, education and income (e.g.,\nKaplan & Talbot 1988). One conclusion often drawn is that there is\na widespread, perhaps universal, human preference for savanna\nlandscapes, even among communities whose own historically stable\nhabitat is very different, and that this preference is reflected in\nthe design of parks and gardens (Falk & Balling 2010). It is\nfurther asserted that this is the product of our evolutionary\ndevelopment in an East African context (E. O. Wilson 1975 is an early\nsource of this idea); for detailed discussion, references, and some\nreservations see S. Davies 2012: ch. 6.\n\nThe non-prescriptive nature of much empirical research into responses\nto the environment contrasts with a view influential in philosophical\naesthetics according to which there are quite demanding cognitive\nrequirements for a correct aesthetic appreciation of nature. The\nquestion mirrors one we have already discussed for the arts: what\nfactors, other than the sensory appearance of an object, are relevant\nto enjoying, appreciating and judging it aesthetically? In the case of\nthe arts we saw that one answer is to consider the work\u2019s\ncategory\u2014the (artistic) kind of thing it is (Walton 1970; see\nabove\n Section 5).\n Allen Carlson (2000) extends this idea to the aesthetics of nature,\narguing that a scene or object must be understood as belonging to a\nnatural kind, and as having the causal history characteristic of that\nkind; that is the right way to perceive it and aesthetic judgements\nabout it are correct only if they are tied to that category. This\nimplies that much human aesthetic experience of nature has been\nradically incorrect, being uninformed by the relevant scientific facts\nand often infused with notions of supernatural creation. Some will\nfind this an acceptable consequence; we are used to thinking that many\nlong-standing human ethical judgements have been radically mistaken,\nand aesthetic judgements might go the same way. Others however,\nquestion whether the aesthetic delight one takes in, say, a bird in\nflight depends for its acceptability on understanding the natural\nhistory of the creature (Budd 2001).\n\nA different and perhaps more accommodating approach to identifying\nwhat is distinctive in aesthetic appreciation of the environment\nconnects an older way of thinking with recent work on cognition. The\neighteenth century focused attention on notions of the sublime\n(notably Burke [1757], but in a line of thought from Longinus) and the\npicturesque (Gilpin 1782, with roots in the older concept of\npittoresco). These, particularly the former, have generated\ncontroversies about their relations to beauty\u2014are they\nsubspecies of beauty or categories distinct from it?\u2014and about\ntheir extensions\u2014is it only nature that can be sublime? The\nquestion also arises as to whether terms like \u201cthe\nsublime\u201d pick out a class of objects to which there is actually\na common aesthetic response. This sounds like something on which we\ncould get help from the cognitive sciences, and work by Keltner and\nHaight (2003), drawing on a range of empirical and reflective sources,\nhas been particularly noticed. Their work was on the concept of awe\nrather than the sublime but they note obvious connections, given the\nthought that the sublime involves a response to things physically or\nconceptually vast. They suggest that awe involves the recognition of\nthe apparent vastness of the object or scene attended to and the\ninability of the subject to assimilate it to their existing mental\nschemas. Other research suggests a strongly pan-cultural component in\nnonverbal expressions of this emotion (Keltner et al. 2019), and its\nassociation with a diminished sense of self (Piff et al. 2015; Tom\nCochrane (2012) has argued that the sublime is characterised by a\nfeeling of self-negation). It is suggested therefore that the\nexperience of the sublime is an aesthetic form of awe wherein the\nobject is attended to for its own sake (Clewis 2019; Arcangeli et al.\n2020), an idea elaborated by Shapsay (2021) who suggests that the\nsublime sometimes takes a cognitively elaborated form involving\nreflection of the challenge posed to existing schemata by the scene or\nobject one confronts.\n",
