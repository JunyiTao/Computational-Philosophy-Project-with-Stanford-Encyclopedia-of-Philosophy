    "main_text": "\n\nIn the philosophy of mind, the multiple realizability thesis contends\nthat a single mental kind (property, state, event) can be realized by\nmany distinct physical kinds. A common example is pain. Many\nphilosophers have asserted that a wide variety of physical properties,\nstates, or events, sharing no features in common at that level of\ndescription, can all realize the same pain. This thesis served as a\npremise in the most influential argument against early theories that\nidentified mental states with brain states (psychoneural, or\nmind-brain identity theories). It also served in early arguments for\nfunctionalism. Nonreductive physicalists later adopted this premise\nand these arguments (usually without alteration) to challenge all\nvarieties of psychophysical reductionism. The argument was even used\nto challenge the functionalism it initially was offered to support.\nReductionists (and other critics) quickly offered a number of\nresponses, initially attacking either the anti-reductionist or\nanti-identity conclusion from the multiple realizability premise, or\nadvocating accounts of the reduction relation that accommodated\nmultiple realizability. More recently it has become fashionable to\nattack the multiple realizability premise itself. Most recently the\nfirst book-length treatment of multiple realizability and its\nphilosophical import has appeared.\n\nThis entry proceeds mostly chronologically, to indicate the historical\ndevelopment of the topic. Its principle focus is on philosophy of mind\nand cognitive science, but it also indicates the more recent shift in\nemphasis to concerns in the metaphysics of science more generally. It\nis worth mentioning at the outset that multiple realizability has been\nclaimed in physics (e.g., Batterman 2000), biochemistry (Tahko\nforthcoming) and synthetic biology (Koskinen 2019a,b). After more than\nfifty years of detailed philosophical discussion there still seems to\nbe no end in sight for novel ideas about this persistent concern.\n",
