    "main_text": "\n\nEarly modern philosophy in Europe and Great Britain is awash with\ndiscussions of the emotions: they figure not only in philosophical\npsychology and related fields, but also in theories of epistemic\nmethod, metaphysics, ethics, political theory and practical reasoning\nin general. Moreover, interest in the emotions links philosophy with\nwork in other, sometimes unexpected areas, such as medicine, art,\nliterature, and practical guides on everything from child-rearing to\nthe treatment of subordinates. Because of the breadth of the topic,\nthis article can offer only an overview, but perhaps it will be enough\nto give some idea how philosophically rich and challenging the\nconception of the emotions was in this period. Most attention will be\ndevoted to the familiar figures of early modern philosophy and how\nthey conceived of the emotions as valuable, even indispensable aspects\nof embodied human life, which were largely constitutive of the self\nand identity that matter to us practically.\n\nA word of caution is in order: there is a plethora of source material,\nand this entry is offered as a survey for organizing that material.\nAlas, much worthy material must be excluded here. This article and its\nsupplements are designed for readers browsing for specific\ninformation, as well as those hardy souls who may wish to read it\nstraight through. The main document offers a thematic overview of\nearly modern discussions of the emotions. Separate links lead to\ndocuments devoted to the pre-history of the topic, as well as to some\nof the most important individual figures in early modern\nphilosophy.\n",
