    "main_text": "The Beautiful: Aesthetics in the Enlightenment || Empiricism and Subjectivism\n3.3 Late Enlightenment Aesthetics\n\nImmanuel Kant faces squarely the problem of the normativity of\njudgments of taste. Influenced by Hutcheson and the British empiricist\ntradition in general, Kant understands judgments of taste to be\nfounded on a distinctive sort of feeling, a disinterested\npleasure. In taking judgments of taste to be subjective (they are\nfounded on the subject\u2019s feeling of pleasure) and non-cognitive\n(such judgments do not subsume representations under concepts and thus\ndo not ascribe properties to objects), Kant breaks with the German\nrationalist school. However Kant continues to maintain that judgments\nof beauty are like cognitive judgments in making a legitimate claim to\nuniversal agreement \u2013 in contrast to judgments of the agreeable.\nThe question is how to vindicate the legitimacy of this demand. Kant\nargues that the distinctive pleasure underlying judgments of taste is\nthe experience of the harmony of the faculties of the imagination and\nthe understanding, a harmony that arises through their \u201cfree\nplay\u201d in the process of cognizing objects on the basis of given\nsensible intuition. The harmony is \u201cfree\u201d in an experience\nof beauty in the sense that it is not forced by rules of the\nunderstanding, as is the agreement among the faculties in acts of\ncognition. The order and harmony that we experience in the face of the\nbeautiful is subjective, according to Kant; but it is at the same time\nuniversal and normative, by virtue of its relation to the conditions\nof human cognition.\n\nThe emphasis Kant places on the role of the activity of the\nimagination in aesthetic pleasure and discernment typifies a trend in\nEnlightenment thought. Whereas early in the Enlightenment, in French\nclassicism, and to some extent in Christian Wolff and other figures of\nGerman rationalism, the emphasis is on the more-or-less static\nrational order and proportion and on rigid universal rules or laws of\nreason, the trend during the development of Enlightenment aesthetics\nis toward emphasis on the play of the imagination and its\nfecundity in generating associations.\n\nDenis Diderot is an important and influential author on aesthetics. He\nwrote the entry \u201cOn the Origin and Nature of the\nBeautiful\u201d for the Encyclopedia (1752). Like Lessing in\nGermany, Diderot not only philosophized about art and beauty, but also\nwrote plays and influential art criticism. Diderot is strongly\ninfluenced in his writings on aesthetics by the empiricism in England\nand Scotland, but his writing is not limited to that standpoint.\nDiderot repeats the classical dictum that art should imitate nature,\nbut, whereas, for French classicists, the nature that art should\nimitate is ideal nature \u2013 a static, universal rational\norder \u2013 for Diderot, nature is dynamic and productive. For\nDiderot, the nature the artist ought to imitate is the real\nnature we experience, warts and all (as it were). The particularism\nand realism of Diderot\u2019s aesthetics is based on a critique of\nthe standpoint of French classicism (see Cassirer 1935, p. 295f.).\nThis critique exposes the artistic rules represented by French\nclassicists as universal rules of reason as nothing more than\nconventions marking what is considered proper within\na certain tradition. In other words, the prescriptions within the\nFrench classical tradition are artificial, not\nnatural, and constitute fetters to artistic genius. Diderot\ntakes liberation from such fetters to come from turning to the task of\nobserving and imitating actual nature. Diderot\u2019s\nemphasis on the primeval productive power and abundance of nature in\nhis aesthetic writings contributes to the trend toward focus on\nartistic creation and expression (as opposed to artistic appreciation\nand discernment) that is a characteristic of the late Enlightenment\nand the transition to Romanticism.\n\nLessing\u2019s aesthetic writings play an important role in elevating\nthe aesthetic category of expressiveness. In his famous\nLaoco\u00f6n: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry\n(1766), Lessing argues, by comparing the famous Greek statue with the\nrepresentation of Laoco\u00f6n\u2019s suffering in Virgil\u2019s\npoetry, that the aims of poetry and of the visual arts are not\nidentical; he argues that the aim of poetry is not beauty, but\nexpression. In elevating the aesthetic category of expressiveness,\nLessing challenges the notion that all art is imitation of nature. His\nargument also challenges the notion that all the various arts can be\ndeduced from a single principle. Lessing\u2019s argument in\nLaoco\u00f6n supports the contrary thesis that the distinct\narts have distinct aims and methods, and that each should be\nunderstood on its own terms, not in terms of an abstract general\nprinciple from which all arts are to be deduced. For some, especially\nfor critics of the Enlightenment, in this point Lessing is already\nbeyond the Enlightenment. Certainly it is true that the emphasis on\nthe individual or particular, over against the universal, which one\nfinds in other late Enlightenment thinkers, is in tension with\nEnlightenment tenets. Herder (following Hamann to some extent) argues\nthat each individual art object has to be understood in its\nown terms, as a totality complete unto itself. With Herder\u2019s\nstark emphasis on individuality in aesthetics, over against\nuniversality, the supplanting of the Enlightenment with Romanticism\nand Historicism is well advanced. But, according to the point of view\ntaken in this entry, the conception of the Enlightenment according to\nwhich it is distinguished by its prioritization of the order of\nabstract, universal laws and principles, over against concrete\nparticulars and the differences amongst them, is too narrow; it fails\nto account for much of the characteristic richness in the thought of\nthe period. Indeed aesthetics itself, as a discipline, which, as\nnoted, is founded in the Enlightenment by the German rationalist,\nAlexander Baumgarten, owes its existence to the tendency in the\nEnlightenment to search for and discover distinct laws for distinct\nkinds of phenomena (as opposed to insisting that all phenomena be made\nintelligible through the same set of general laws and principles).\nBaumgarten founds aesthetics as a \u2018science\u2019 through the\nattempt to establish the sensible domain as cognizable in a way\ndifferent from that which prevails in metaphysics. Aesthetics in\nGermany in the eighteenth century, from Wolff to Herder, both typifies\nmany of the trends of the Enlightenment and marks the field where the\nEnlightenment yields to competing worldviews.\n",
