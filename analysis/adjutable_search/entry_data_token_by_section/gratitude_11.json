    "main_text": "Accounts of Gratitude || Gratitude as Relationship Enhancement\n4.3 Gratitude as Relationship Enhancement\n\nSome philosophers have conceptualized gratitude, and the benevolence\nto which it is a response, in terms of the relationships they enhance.\nOn these accounts, a genuine act of benevolence is thought to signal a\ndesire or intention to start or to deepen a friendship (Swinburne\n1989: 65), and gratitude is the reciprocation of this intention, which\nenhances or advances the relationship. Wellman (1999b: 287), for\ninstance, writes that a beneficiary who has accepted a genuine act of\nbenevolence should \u201cnaturally be inclined to take a more active\ninterest both in [the benefactor\u2019s] well-being and in their\nfriendship\u201d, and Blustein (1982: 190) writes that while\ngratitude does not presuppose a preexisting personal relationship,\n\u201cit establishes one by some form of\nreciprocation.\u201d That reciprocation, which he calls gratitude,\nencourages friendship. Most recently, Scanlon (2008: 151) has\nadvocated a similar \u201crelationship-enhancement\u201d view of\ngratitude. For Scanlon, gratitude\n\nis not just a positive emotion but also an awareness that one\u2019s\nrelationship with a person has been altered by some action or attitude\non that person\u2019s part.\n\n\nThat awareness is reflected in appropriately modified intentions,\nexpectations, and other attitudes on the part of the beneficiary.\n\nRelationship-enhancement views of gratitude underscore the important\n(perhaps even necessary) role that benevolence and gratitude play in\ninitiating and deepening relationships, like friendships and romantic\nrelationships. Relationship-enhancement views also highlight the\nimportant role acts of benevolence and gratitude might play in\nrelationship repair\u2014the process of rebuilding a relationship\nafter wrong or harm has been committed. But while\nrelationship-enhancement views may paint an accurate picture of\ngratitude between relative strangers or within growing friendships,\nthey seem to leave little room for gratitude within friendships that\nare already sufficiently deep and healthy. Between two extremely close\nfriends, most of the elements of a grateful response might already be\nin place. Each might already believe that the other would sacrifice\ngreatly to help him if he were in need, might already feel profound\ngoodwill for the other, and might already be willing to sacrifice\nsubstantially in order to save the other from harm. When one friend\nactually performs a genuine act of benevolence for the other, the\nbeneficiary would have no reason to revise his expectations\nor intentions or affective dispositions vis-\u00e0-vis his\nbenefactor in light of that; and yet a great deal of gratitude may be\nowed. This suggests that gratitude must be something more than a\nchange in these elements.\n\nAnother problem faced by certain relationship-enhancement views is the\nimplication that a beneficiary who does not want to develop a\nfriendship with the benefactor is, for that reason, ungrateful. This\nimplication does not seem warranted. It is possible, after all, for a\nbeneficiary to be grateful but uninterested in deepening a bond with\nhis benefactor. Perhaps he finds his benefactor irritating to be\naround. Perhaps he is too busy to spend time cultivating a new\nrelationship. Perhaps he is simply a loner. All these possibilities\nseem, intuitively, to be consistent with such a beneficiary avoiding\ningratitude; and insofar as they are, gratitude must be something more\nthan the tendency to develop relationships, at least in the sense of\nfriendship or romance.\n",
