    "main_text": "Introduction || Background\n1.1 Background\n\nMontague semantics is the approach to the semantics of natural\nlanguage introduced by Richard Montague in the 1970s. He described the\naim of his enterprise as follows:\n\nThe basic aim of semantics is to characterize the notion of a true\nsentence (under a given interpretation) and of entailment (Montague\n1970c, 373 fn).\n\n\nThe salient points of Montague\u2019s approach are a model theoretic\nsemantics, a systematic relation between syntax and semantics, and a\nfully explicit description of a fragment of natural language. His\napproach constituted a revolution: after the Chomskyan revolution that\nbrought mathematical methods into syntax, now such methods were\nintroduced in semantics.\n\nMontague\u2019s approach became influential, as many authors began to\nwork in his framework and conferences were devoted to \u2018Montague\ngrammar\u2019. Later on, certain aspects of his approach were adapted\nor changed, became generally accepted or were entirely abandoned.\nNowadays not many authors would describe their own work as\n\u2018Montague semantics\u2019 given the many differences that have\ntaken shape in semantics since Montague\u2019s own work, but his\nideas have left important traces, and changed the semantic landscape\nforever. In our presentation of Montague semantics the focus will be\non these developments.\n\nRichard Montague was a mathematical logician who had specialized in\nset theory and modal logic. His views on natural language must be\nunderstood with his mathematical background in mind. Montague held the\nview that natural language was a formal language very much in the same\nsense as predicate logic was a formal language. As such, in\nMontague\u2019s view, the study of natural language belonged to\nmathematics, and not to psychology (Thomason 1974, 2). Montague\nformulated his views:\n\nThere is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between\nnatural languages and the artificial languages of logicians; indeed I\nconsider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both\nkinds of languages with a single natural and mathematically precise\ntheory. (Montague 1970c, 373)\n\n\nSometimes only the first part of the quote is recalled, and that might\nraise the question whether he did not notice the great differences:\nfor instance that natural languages develop without an a priori set of\nrules whereas artificial languages have an explicit syntax and are\ndesigned for a special purpose. But the quote as a whole expresses\nclearly what Montague meant by \u2018no important theoretical\ndifference\u2019; the \u2018single natural and mathematically\nprecise theory\u2019 which he aimed at, is presented in his paper\n\u2018Universal Grammar\u2019 (Montague 1970c). He became most\nwell-known after the appearance of Montague 1973, in which the theory\nis applied to some phenomena which were discussed intensively in the\nphilosophical literature of those days.\n\nAccording to Caponigro (forthcoming), Montague\u2019s interest in the\nfield arose when preparing a seminar on the philosophy of language as\na visiting professor in Amsterdam in 1966. Only a couple of years\nearlier, he had deemed the \u201csystematic exploration of the\nEnglish language, indeed of what might be called the \u2018logic of\nordinary English\u2019, [\u2026] either extremely laborious or\nimpossible\u201d and did \u2018not find it rewarding\u2019\n(Montague and Kalish 1964, 10). Yet he appears to have changed his\nmind after perusing Quine\u2019s (1960) Word and Object as\nwell as Chomsky\u2019s (1965) Aspects of the Theory of\nSyntax: the latter opened the perspective of treating the syntax\nof natural language as a formal system but failed to provide any\nserious analysis of linguistic meaning; the former offered a\nsystematic connection between traditional grammar and formal logic\n\u2013 and much more systematically so than contemporary logic texts.\nIn fact, Montague\u2019s semantic work owes a lot to Quine\u2019s\ndescriptive insights into the \u2018logic of ordinary English\u2019,\nbut differs from his predecessor by making the connection between\nlanguage and logic in rigorous, mathematical terms:\n\nIt should be emphasized that this is not a matter of vague intuition,\nas in elementary logic courses, but an assertion to which we have\nassigned exact significance. (Montague 1973, 237)\n\n\nWe next describe the basic ideas of Montague semantics. Section\n 2\n presents several components of Montague semantics in more detail.\nSection\n 3\n includes a discussion of philosophically interesting aspects, and\nSection\n 4\n provides a detailed example and further reading.\n",
