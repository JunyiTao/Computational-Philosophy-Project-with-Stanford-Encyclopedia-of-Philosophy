    "main_text": "Irrealism and Worldmaking || Irrealism\n6.2 Worldmaking\nWhile Goodman insists that \u201cthere are many worlds, if\nany\u201d (MM, 127; see also MM, 31), Goodman\u2019s worlds should not be\nconflated with possible worlds. There are no merely possible Goodman\nworlds, they are all actual (WW, 94 and 104; MM, 31). It is Goodman\u2019s\nview that worlds are \u201cmade\u201d by answering to right\nversions, but there are no (merely possible) worlds that correspond to\nfalse versions. It is important to note that this view does not\ncollapse into irrationalism or a fancy form of cultural relativism\nfavored by postmodern thinkers. Making a true version is not\ntrivial. Not surprisingly, it is not any easier than making a true\nversion is for a realist. How we make true versions is absolutely the\nsame on both accounts; the difference is only with respect\nto what we do when we make true versions (see WW and\nMcCormick 1996 for discussion).\nThe constraints on worldmaking are strict. We cannot just create\nthings; predicates must be entrenched and thus there must be some\nclose continuity with former versions. Simplicity will keep us from\ncreating new things from scratch, coherence from making anything in\nconflict with beliefs with higher initial credibility, and so on.\nA world is made by making a world version. So, according to\nGoodman, the making of a world version is what has to be understood.\nCarnap\u2019s Aufbau, as already mentioned, presents a world\nversion, the systems in A Study of Qualities and The\nStructure of Appearance are world versions, and so are scientific\ntheories. The heliocentric and geocentric worldviews are relatively\nprimitive world versions, while Einstein\u2019s theory of general\nrelativity is a more sophisticated one. World versions do not have to\nbe constructed in a formal language, though; indeed, they do not need\nto be in a language, formal or informal, at all. The symbol systems\nused in the arts\u2014such as in painting, for instance\u2014can be\nused in the process of worldmaking too. It is in this sense that\nphilosophy, science, and art are all epistemically significant; they\nall contribute to our understanding; they all help to create\nworlds.\nMaking a world version is difficult. Acknowledging a great number\nof them does not make it easier. The hard work lies, for example, in\ncreating a constructional system that overcomes the problems of its\npredecessors, is simple, uses well-entrenched predicates, or\nsuccessfully replaces them with new ones (which is even harder),\nallows us to make useful predictions and so on. For Goodman,\nscientists, artists, and philosophers are faced with analogous\nproblems in this.\nGoodman\u2019s insistence that we make worlds when we make their\nversions and that we might just as well replace talking about worlds\nwith talk about versions creates a problem that is not simply solved\nby acknowledging that making a true version is very hard. Making a\nversion and making the objects that the version is about are clearly\ntwo different tasks. As Israel Scheffler writes in the abstract to\n\u201cThe Wonderful Worlds of Goodman\u201d:\n\nThe worldmaking urged by Goodman is elusive: Are worlds to be\nidentified with (true) world-versions or do they rather comprise what\nis referred to by such versions? Various passages in [WW] suggest one\nanswer, various passages another. That versions are made is easy to\naccept; that the things they refer to are, equally, made, I find\nunacceptable. (Scheffler 1979, 618)\n\nIndeed, Scheffler argues, Goodman confusingly uses\n\u201cworld\u201d and \u201cworldmaking\u201d both in a versional\nand in an objectual sense. As we said above, Goodman\u2019s claim is that\nwe make a world in the objectual sense by making a version of it.  The\nclaim is based on his conviction that the only structure of the world\nto which all true versions correspond does not exist independently;\nrather, it is only to be found because we project this structure onto\nthe world with our conceptualizations. His favorite example is the\nconstellation known as \u201cBig Dipper\u201d. Indeed, we\n\u201cmade\u201d the Big Dipper by picking out one arbitrary\nconstellation of stars and naming it. (More precisely, it is a\nso-called asterism that is part of the constellation Ursa\nMajor\u2014but the point still stands.) Which arrangement of\nheavenly bodies makes up the Big Dipper is purely conventional and\nhence only due to our conceptualization. Hilary Putnam (1992a)\nsuggests that this idea may have some plausibility for the Big Dipper,\nbut it does not, for instance, hold true of the stars that constitute\nthe Big Dipper. True, \u201cstar\u201d is a concept with partly\nconventional boundaries; however, that the concept \u201cstar\u201d\nhas conventional elements does not make it a matter of convention that\n\u201cstar\u201d applies to something (and thus merely a matter of\nmaking a world version).\nPutnam also points out that there is a tension between Goodman\u2019s\nnotion of worldmaking and his first line of thought that leads to his\nirrealism: the idea that there are conflicting statements in different\nadequate world versions. As Putnam argues, to say that a statement of\none world version is incompatible with that of another (such that a\nsingle world cannot accommodate both versions) requires that the\nexpressions in the two versions have the same meaning. However, it is\nnot clear that our ordinary notion of meaning allows such\ninter-version comparison of sameness of meaning (a thought that\nGoodman should be sympathetic to, since he already doubts an\nintra-version notion of that kind). Moreover, there might be better\nways to compare alternative versions (e.g., by way of\nhomomorphism-relations between versions, as developed by Goodman in SA\nand discussed above in 4.1) and to explain how versions relate despite\ntheir apparent incompatibility (for example, by paying attention to\nthe practice of scientists who manage to move from one version to\nanother).\n",
