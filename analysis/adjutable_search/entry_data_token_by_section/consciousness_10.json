    "main_text": "The descriptive question: What are the features of consciousness? || Subjectivity\n4.4 Subjectivity\n\nSubjectivity is another notion sometimes equated with the\nqualitative or the phenomenal aspects of consciousness in the\nliterature, but again there are good reason to recognize it, at least\nin some of its forms, as a distinct feature of\nconsciousness\u2014related to the qualitative and the phenomenal but\ndifferent from each.  In particular, the epistemic form of\nsubjectivity concerns apparent limits on the knowability or even the\nunderstandability of various facts about conscious experience (Nagel\n1974, Van Gulick 1985, Lycan 1996).\n\n\nOn Thomas Nagel's (1974) account, facts about what it is like to be\na bat are subjective in the relevant sense because they can be fully\nunderstood only from the bat-type point of view. Only creatures capable\nof having or undergoing similar such experiences can understand their\nwhat-it's-likeness in the requisite empathetic sense. Facts about\nconscious experience can be at best incompletely understood from an\noutside third person point of view, such as those associated with\nobjective physical science. A similar view about the limits of\nthird-person theory seems to lie behind claims regarding what Frank\nJackson's (1982) hypothetical Mary, the super color scientist, could\nnot understand about experiencing red because of her own impoverished\nhistory of achromatic visual experience.\n\n\nWhether facts about experience are indeed epistemically limited in\nthis way is open to debate (Lycan 1996), but the claim that\nunderstanding consciousness requires special forms of knowing and\naccess from the inside point of view is intuitively plausible and has a\nlong history (Locke 1688). Thus any adequate answer to the What\nquestion must address the epistemic status of consciousness, both our\nabilities to understand it and their limits (Papineau 2002, Chalmers\n2003).
