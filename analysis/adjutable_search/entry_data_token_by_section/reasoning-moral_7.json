    "main_text": "General Philosophical Questions about Moral Reasoning || Moral Principles\n2.2 Moral Principles\n\nThat one discerns features and qualities of some situation that are\nrelevant to sizing it up morally does not yet imply that one\nexplicitly or even implicitly employs any general claims in describing\nit. Perhaps all that one perceives are particularly embedded features\nand qualities, without saliently perceiving them as\ninstantiations of any types. Sartre\u2019s student may be focused on\nhis mother and on the particular plights of several of his fellow\nFrenchmen under Nazi occupation, rather than on any purported\nrequirements of filial duty or patriotism. Having become aware of some\nmoral issue in such relatively particular terms, he might proceed\ndirectly to sorting out the conflict between them. Another\npossibility, however, and one that we frequently seem to exploit, is\nto formulate the issue in general terms: \u201cAn only child should\nstick by an otherwise isolated parent,\u201d for instance, or\n\u201cone should help those in dire need if one can do so without\nsignificant personal sacrifice.\u201d Such general statements would\nbe examples of \u201cmoral principles,\u201d in a broad sense. (We\ndo not here distinguish between principles and rules. Those who do\ninclude Dworkin 1978 and Gert 1998.) \n\nWe must be careful, here, to distinguish the issue of whether\nprinciples commonly play an implicit or explicit role in moral\nreasoning, including well-conducted moral reasoning, from the issue of\nwhether principles necessarily figure as part of the basis of moral\ntruth. The latter issue is best understood as a metaphysical question\nabout the nature and basis of moral facts. What is currently known as\n moral particularism\n is the view that there are no defensible moral principles and that\nmoral reasons, or well-grounded moral facts, can exist independently\nof any basis in a general principle. A contrary view holds that moral\nreasons are necessarily general, whether because the sources of their\njustification are all general or because a moral claim is ill-formed\nif it contains particularities. But whether principles play a useful\nrole in moral reasoning is certainly a different question from whether\nprinciples play a necessary role in accounting for the ultimate\ntruth-conditions of moral statements. Moral particularism, as just\ndefined, denies their latter role. Some moral particularists seem also\nto believe that moral particularism implies that moral\nprinciples cannot soundly play a useful role in reasoning. This claim\nis disputable, as it seems a contingent matter whether the relevant\nparticular facts arrange themselves in ways susceptible to general\nsummary and whether our cognitive apparatus can cope with them at all\nwithout employing general principles. Although the metaphysical\ncontroversy about moral particularism lies largely outside our topic,\nwe will revisit it in\n section 2.5,\n in connection with the weighing of conflicting reasons. \n\nWith regard to moral reasoning, while there are some self-styled\n\u201canti-theorists\u201d who deny that abstract structures of\nlinked generalities are important to moral reasoning (Clarke, et al.\n1989), it is more common to find philosophers who recognize both some\nrole for particular judgment and some role for moral principles. Thus,\nneo-Aristotelians like Nussbaum who emphasize the importance of\n\u201cfinely tuned and richly aware\u201d particular discernment\nalso regard that discernment as being guided by a set of generally\ndescribable virtues whose general descriptions will come into play in\nat least some kinds of cases (Nussbaum 1990). \u201cSituation\nethicists\u201d of an earlier generation (e.g. Fletcher 1997)\nemphasized the importance of taking into account a wide range of\ncircumstantial differentiae, but against the background of some\ngeneral principles whose application the differentiae help sort out.\nFeminist ethicists influenced by Carol Gilligan\u2019s path breaking\nwork on moral development have stressed the moral centrality of the\nkind of care and discernment that are salient and well-developed by\npeople immersed in particular relationships (Held 1995); but this\nemphasis is consistent with such general principles as \u201cone\nought to be sensitive to the wishes of one\u2019s friends\u201d(see\nthe entry on\n feminist moral psychology).\n Again, if we distinguish the question of whether principles are\nuseful in responsibly-conducted moral thinking from the question of\nwhether moral reasons ultimately all derive from general principles,\nand concentrate our attention solely on the former, we will see that\nsome of the opposition to general moral principles melts away. \n\nIt should be noted that we have been using a weak notion of\ngenerality, here. It is contrasted only with the kind of strict\nparticularity that comes with indexicals and proper names. General\nstatements or claims \u2013 ones that contain no such particular\nreferences \u2013 are not necessarily universal generalizations,\nmaking an assertion about all cases of the mentioned type.\nThus, \u201cone should normally help those in dire need\u201d is a\ngeneral principle, in this weak sense. Possibly, such logically loose\nprinciples would be obfuscatory in the context of an attempt to\nreconstruct the ultimate truth-conditions of moral statements. Such\nlogically loose principles would clearly be useless in any attempt to\ngenerate a deductively tight \u201cpractical syllogism.\u201d In our\nday-to-day, non-deductive reasoning, however, such logically loose\nprinciples appear to be quite useful. (Recall that we are\nunderstanding \u201creasoning\u201d quite broadly, as responsibly\nconducted thinking: nothing in this understanding of reasoning\nsuggests any uniquely privileged place for deductive inference: cf.\nHarman 1986. For more on defeasible or \u201cdefault\u201d\nprinciples, see\n section 2.5.)\n \n\nIn this terminology, establishing that general principles are\nessential to moral reasoning leaves open the further question whether\nlogically tight, or exceptionless, principles are also essential to\nmoral reasoning. Certainly, much of our actual moral reasoning seems\nto be driven by attempts to recast or reinterpret principles so that\nthey can be taken to be exceptionless. Adherents and\ninheritors of the natural-law tradition in ethics (e.g. Donagan 1977)\nare particularly supple defenders of exceptionless moral principles,\nas they are able to avail themselves not only of a refined tradition\nof casuistry but also of a wide array of subtle \u2013 some would say\noverly subtle \u2013 distinctions, such as those mentioned above\nbetween doing and allowing and between intending as a means and\naccepting as a byproduct. \n\nA related role for a strong form of generality in moral reasoning\ncomes from the Kantian thought that one\u2019s moral reasoning must\ncounter one\u2019s tendency to make exceptions for oneself.\nAccordingly, Kant holds, as we have noted, that we must ask whether\nthe maxims of our actions can serve as universal laws. As most\ncontemporary readers understand this demand, it requires that we\nengage in a kind of hypothetical generalization across agents, and ask\nabout the implications of everybody acting that way in those\ncircumstances. The grounds for developing Kant\u2019s thought in this\ndirection have been well explored (e.g., Nell 1975, Korsgaard 1996,\nEngstrom 2009). The importance and the difficulties of such a\nhypothetical generalization test in ethics were discussed the\ninfluential works Gibbard 1965 and Goldman 1974. \n",
