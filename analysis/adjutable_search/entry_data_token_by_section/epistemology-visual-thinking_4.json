    "main_text": "Visual thinking and proof || Visual means in non-formal proving\n3.2 Visual means in non-formal proving\nMathematical practice almost never proceeds by way of formal\nsystems. Outside the context of formal diagrammatic systems, the use\nof diagrams is widely felt to be unreliable. A diagram can be\nunfaithful to the described construction: it may represent something\nwith a property that is ruled out by the description, or without a\nproperty that is demanded by the description. This is exemplified by\ndiagrams in the famous argument for the proposition that all triangles\nare isosceles: the meeting point of an angle bisector and the\nperpendicular bisector of the opposite side is represented as falling\ninside the triangle, when it has to be outside (Rouse Ball 1939;\nMaxwell 1959).  Errors of this sort are comparatively rare, usually\navoidable with a modicum of care, and not inherent in the nature of\ndiagrams; so they do not warrant a general charge of\nunreliability.\n The major sort of error is unwarranted generalisation.  Typically\ndiagrams (and other non-verbal visual representations) do not\nrepresent their objects as having a property that is actually ruled\nout by the intention or specification of the object to be\nrepresented. But diagrams very frequently do represent their objects\nas having properties that, though not ruled out by the specification,\nare not demanded by it. Verbal descriptions can be discrete, in that\nthey supply no more information than is needed. But visual\nrepresentations are typically indiscrete, in that they supply too much\ndetail. This is often unavoidable, because for many properties or\nkinds \\(F\\), a visual representation cannot represent something as\nbeing \\(F\\) without representing it as being \\(F\\) in a particular\nway. Any diagram of a triangle, for instance, must represent it\nas having three acute angles or as having just two acute angles, even\nif neither property is required by the specification, as would be the\ncase if the specification were \u201cLet ABC be a triangle\u201d. As\na result there is a danger that in using a diagram to reason about an\narbitrary instance of class \\(K\\), we will unwittingly rely on a\nfeature represented in the diagram that is not common to all instances\nof the class \\(K\\). Thus the risk of unwarranted generalisation is a\ndanger inherent in the use of many diagrams.\nIndiscretion of diagrams is not confined to geometrical\nfigures. The dot or pebble diagrams of ancient mathematics used to\nconvince one of elementary truths of number theory necessarily display\nparticular numbers of dots, though the truths are general. Here is an\nexample, used to justify the formula for the \\(n\\)th\ntriangular number, i.e., the sum of the first \\(n\\) positive\nintegers.\n\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe conclusion drawn is that the sum of integers from 1 to \\(n\\) is\n\\((n \\times n+1)/2\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\), but the diagram\npresents the case for \\(n = 6\\). We can perhaps avoid representing a\nparticular number of dots when we merely imagine a display of the\nrelevant kind; or if a particular number is represented, our\nexperience may not make us aware of the number\u2014just as, when one\nimagines the sky on a starry night, for no particular number \\(k\\) are\nwe aware that exactly \\(k\\) stars are represented. Even so, there is\nlikely to be some extra specificity. For example, in imagining an\narray of dots of the form just illustrated, one is unlikely to imagine\njust two columns of three dots, the rectangular array for \\(n =\n2\\). Typically the subject will be aware of imagining an array with\nmore than two columns.  This entails that an image is likely to have\nunintended exclusions. In this case it would exclude the three-by-two\narray. An image of a triangle representing all angles as acute would\nexclude triangles with an obtuse angle or a right angle. The danger is\nthat the visual reasoning will not be valid for the cases that are\nunintentionally excluded by the visual representation, with the result\nthat the step to the conclusion is an unwarranted generalisation.\nWhat should we make of this? First, let us note that in a few cases\nthe image or diagram will not be over-specific. When in geometry all\ninstances of the relevant class are congruent to one another, for\ninstance all circles or all squares, the image or diagram will not be\nover-specific for a generalisation about that class; so there will be\nno unintended exclusions and no danger of unwarranted generalisation.\nHere then are possibilities for reliable visual thinking in\nproving.\nTo get clear about the other cases, where there is a\ndanger of over generalizing, it helps to look at generalisation in\nordinary non-visual reasoning. Schematically put, in reasoning about\nthings of kind \\(K\\), once we have shown that from certain premisses\nit follows that such-and-such a condition is true of arbitrary\ninstance \\(c\\), we can validly infer from those same premisses that\nthat condition is true of all \\(K\\)s, with the proviso that neither\nthe condition nor any premiss mentions \\(c\\). The proviso is required,\nbecause if a premiss or the condition does mention \\(c\\), the\nreasoning may depend on a property of \\(c\\) that is not shared by all\nother \\(K\\)s and so the generalisation would be unsafe. For a trivial\nexample consider a step from \u201c\\(x = c\\)\u201d to\n\u201c\\(\\forall x [x = c]\\)\u201d.\nA question we face is whether, in order to come to know\nthe truth of a conclusion by following an argument involving\ngeneralisation on an arbitrary instance (a.k.a. universal\ngeneralisation, or universal quantifier introduction), the thinking\nmust include a conscious, explicit check that the proviso is met. It\nis clearly not enough that the proviso is in fact met. For in that\ncase it might just be the thinker\u2019s good luck that the proviso\nis met; hence the thinker would not know that the generalisation is\nvalid and so would not have genuinely thought through the proof at\nthat step.\nThis leaves two options. The strict option is that without a\nconscious, explicit check one has not really thought through the\nproof.  The relaxed option is that one can properly think\nthrough the proof without checking that the proviso is met, but only\nif one is sensitive to the potential error and would detect it in\notherwise similar arguments. For then one is not just lucky that the\nproviso is met. Being sensitive in this context consists in being\nalert to dependence on features of the arbitrary instance not shared\nby all members of the class of generalisation, a state produced by a\ncombination of past experience and current vigilance. Without\ncompelling reason to prefer one of these options, decisions on what is\nto count as proving or following a proof must be conditional. \nHow does all this apply to generalizing from visual thinking about\nan arbitrary instance? Take the example of the visual route to the\nformula for triangular numbers using the diagram of Figure 2. The diagram reveals that the formula holds\nfor the 6th triangular number. The generalisation to all\ntriangular numbers is justified only if the visuo-spatial method used\nis applicable to the \\(n\\)th triangular number for all\npositive integers \\(n\\), that is, provided that the method used does\nnot depend on a property not shared by all positive integers. A\nconscious, explicit check that this proviso is met requires making\nexplicit the method exemplified for 6 and proving that the method is\napplicable for all positive integers in place of 6. (For a similar\nidea in the context of automating visual arguments, see Jamnik\n2001). This is not done in practice when thinking visually, and so if\nwe accept the strict option for thinking through a proof involving\ngeneralisation, we would have to accept that the visual route to the\nformula for triangular numbers does not amount to thinking through a\nproof of it; and the same would apply to the familiar visual routes to\nother general positive integer formulas, such as that \\(n^2 =\\) the\nsum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers.\nBut what if the strict option for proving by generalisation on an\narbitrary instance is too strict, and the relaxed option is right?\nWhen arriving at the formula in the visual way indicated, one does not\npay attention to the fact that the visual display represents the\nsituation for the 6th triangular number; it is as if the\nmind had somehow extracted a general schema of visual reasoning from\nexposure to the particular case, and had then proceeded to reason\nschematically, converting a schematic result into a universal\nproposition. What is required, on the relaxed option, is sensitivity\nto the possibility that the schema is not applicable to all positive\nintegers; one must be so alert to ways a schema of the given kind can\nfall short of universal applicability that if one had been presented\nwith a schema that did fall short, one would have detected the\nfailure. \nIn the example at hand, the schema of visual reasoning involves at\nthe start taking a number \\(k\\) to be represented by a column of \\(k\\)\ndots, thence taking the triangular array of \\(n\\) columns to represent\nthe sum of the first \\(n\\) positive integers, thence taking that array\ncombined with an inverted copy to make a rectangular array of \\(n\\)\ncolumns of \\(n+1\\) dots. For a schema starting this way to be\nuniversally applicable, it must be possible, given any positive\ninteger \\(n\\), for the sum of the first \\(n\\) positive integers to be\nrepresented in the form of a triangular array, so that combined with\nan inverted copy one gets a rectangular array. This actually fails at\nthe extreme case: \\(n = 1\\). The formula \\((n.(n + 1))/2\\) holds for\nthis case; but that is something we know by substituting\n\u201c1\u201d for the variable in the formula, not by the visual\nmethod indicated. That method cannot be applied to \\(n = 1\\), because\na single dot does not form a triangular array, and combined with a\ncopy it does not form a rectangular array. But we can check that the\nmethod works for all positive integers after the first, using visual\nreasoning to assure ourselves that it works for 2 and that if the\nmethod works for \\(k\\) it works for \\(k+1\\). Together with this\nreflective thinking, the visual thinking sketched earlier constitutes\nfollowing a proof of the formula for the \\(n\\)th triangular\nnumber for all integers \\(n > 1\\), at least if the relaxed view of\nthinking through a proof is correct. Similar conclusions hold in the\ncase of other \u201cdot\u201d arguments (Giaquinto 1993, 2007:\nch. 8). So in some cases when the visual representation carries\nunwanted detail, the danger of over-generalisation in visual reasoning\ncan be overcome.\nBut the fact that this is frequently missed by commentators\nsuggests that the required sensitivity is often absent. Missing an\nuntypical case is a common hazard in attempts at visual proving. A\nwell-known example is the proof of Euler\u2019s formula \\(V - E + F =\n2\\) for polyhedra by \u201cremoving triangles\u201d of a\ntriangulated planar projection of a polyhedron. One is easily\nconvinced by the thinking, but only because the polyhedra we normally\nthink of are convex, while the exceptions are not convex. But it is\nalso easy to miss a case which is not untypical or extreme when\nthinking visually. An example is Cauchy\u2019s attempted proof\n(Cauchy 1813) of the claim that if a convex polygon is transformed\ninto another polygon keeping all but one of the sides constant, then\nif some or all of the internal angles at the vertices increase, the\nremaining side increases, while if some or all of the internal angles\nat the vertices decrease, the remaining side decreases.  The argument\nproceeds by considering what happens when one transforms a polygon by\nincreasing (or decreasing) angles, angle by angle. But in a trapezoid,\nchanging a single angle can turn a convex polygon into a concave\npolygon, and this invalidates the argument (Lyusternik 1963).\nThe frequency of such mistakes indicates that visual arguments\n(other than symbol manipulations) often lack the transparency required\nfor proof. Even when a visual argument is in fact sound, its soundness\nmay not be clear, in which case the argument is not a way of\nproving the truth of the conclusion, though it may be a way\nof discovering it. But this is consistent with the claim that visual\nnon-symbolic thinking can be (and often is) part of a way of proving\nsomething.\nAn example from knot theory will substantiate the modal part of\nthis claim. To present the example, we need some background\ninformation, which will be given with a minimum of technical\ndetail.\nA knot is a tame closed non-self-intersecting curve in\nEuclidean 3-space.\nIn other words, knots are just the tame curves in Euclidean 3-space\nwhich are homeomorphic to a circle. The word \u201ctame\u201d here\nstands for a property intended to rule out certain pathological cases,\nsuch as curves with infinitely nested knotting. There is more than one\nway of making this mathematically precise, but we have no need for\nthese details. A knot has a specific geometric shape, size and\naxis-relative position. Now imagine it to be made of flexible yet\nunbreakable yarn that is stretchable and shrinkable, so that it can be\nsmoothly transformed into other knots without cutting or gluing. Since\nour interest in a knot is the nature of its knottedness regardless of\nshape, size or axis-relative position, the real focus of interest is\nnot just the knot but all its possible transforms. A way to think of\nthis is to imagine a knot transforming continuously, so that every\npossible transform is realized at some time. Then the thing of central\ninterest would be the object that persists over time in varying forms,\nwith knots strictly so called being the things captured in each\nparticular freeze frame. Mathematically, we represent the relevant\nentity as an equivalence class of knots.\nTwo knots are equivalent iff one can be smoothly deformed into the other by stretching, shrinking, twisting, flipping, repositioning or in any other way that does not involve cutting, gluing or passing one strand through another.\nThe relevant kind of deformation forbids eliminating a knotted part\nby shrinking it down to a point. Again there are mathematically\nprecise definitions of knot-equivalence. Figure 3 gives diagrams of\nequivalent knots, instances of a trefoil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\nDiagrams like these are not merely illustrations; they also have an\noperational role in knot theory. But not any picture of a knot will do\nfor this purpose. We need to specify:\n A knot diagram is a regular projection of a knot onto a plane which, when there is a crossing, tells us which strand passes over the other.\nRegularity here is a combination of conditions. In particular,\nregularity entails that not more than two points of the strict knot\nproject to the same point on the plane, and that two points of the\nstrict knot project to the same point on the plane only where there is\na crossing. For more on diagrams in knot theory see (De Toffoli and\nGiardino 2014).\nA major task of knot theory is to find ways of telling whether two\nknot diagrams are diagrams of equivalent knots. In particular we will\nwant to know if a given knot diagram represents a knot equivalent to\nan unknot, that is, a knot representable by a knot diagram\nwithout crossings.\nOne way of showing that a knot diagram represents a knot equivalent\nto an unknot is to show that the diagram can be transformed into one\nwithout crossings by a sequence of atomic moves, known as Reidemeister\nmoves. The relevant background fact is Reidemeister\u2019s theorem,\nwhich links the visualizable diagrammatic changes to the\nmathematically precise definition of knot equivalence: Two knots are\nequivalent if and only if there is a finite sequence of Reidemeister\nmoves taking a knot diagram of one to a knot diagram of the\nother. Figure 4 illustrates.  Each knot diagram is changed into the\nadjacent knot diagram by a Reidemeister move; hence the knot\nrepresented by the leftmost diagram is equivalent to the unknot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n(b) \n\n\n(c) \n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\nIn contrast to these, the knot presented by the left knot diagram\nof Figure 3, a trefoil, may seem impossible to\ndeform into an unknot. And in fact it is. To prove it, we can use a\nknot invariant known as colourability. An arc in a knot diagram is a\nmaximal part between crossings (or the whole thing if there are no\ncrossings). Colourability is this:\n A knot diagram is colourable if and only if each of its arcs can be coloured one of three different colours so that (a) at least two colours are used and (b) at each crossing the three arcs are all coloured the same or all coloured differently.\nThe reference to colours here is inessential. Colourability is in\nfact a specific case of a kind of combinatorial property known as mod\n\\(p\\) labelling (for \\(p\\) an odd prime). Colourability is a knot\ninvariant in the sense that if one diagram of a knot is colourable\nevery diagram of that knot and of any equivalent knot is\ncolourable. (By Reidemeister\u2019s theorem this can be proved by\nshowing that each Reidemeister move preserves colourability.) A\nstandard diagram of an unknot, a diagram without crossings, is clearly\nnot colourable because it has only one arc (the whole thing) and so\ntwo colours cannot be used. So in order to complete proving that the\ntrefoil is not equivalent to an unknot, we only need prove that our\ntrefoil diagram is colourable. This can be done visually. Colour each\narc of the knot diagram one of the three colours red, green or blue so\nthat no two arcs have the same colour (or visualize this). Then do a\nvisual check of each crossing, to see that at each crossing the three\nmeeting arcs are all coloured differently. That visual part of the\nproof is clearly non-superfluous and non-replaceable (without changing\nthe proof). Moreover, the soundness of the argument is quite\ntransparent.  So here is a case of a non-formal, non-symbolic visual\nway of proving a mathematical truth.\n",
