    "main_text": "Other interests || Fate and Voluntary Action\n4.1 Fate and Voluntary Action\n\nOur principal source for the Hellenistic phase of the the first debate\nand Carneades\u2019 contributions to it is Cicero\u2019s De\nfato, which has survived only in an incomplete form. (A Latin\ntext with an English translation and helpful notes is found in\nSharples, 1991; older but still useful is Bayer, 1963 with a German\ntranslation and notes. On the debate as a whole, see Bobzien, 1998).\nIt is clear from the De fato that Carneades took on both the\nStoics and the Epicureans. Cicero\u2019s presentation suggests that\nhe may have defended a consistent position distinct from theirs. If he\ndid, here as elsewhere we do not need to decide whether he endorsed it\nin propria persona or put it forward as an alternative to\nchallenge to the positions on offer. It was at least the latter,\nserving to show the Epicureans and the Stoics that there was another,\narguably better, way to tackle the issues, one that avoided the most\ntroubling and implausible choices to which they had been led in the\nconstruction of their own theories.\n\nThe Stoics held that all things come about by fate. Fate they define\nas \u2018the ordered series of causes, when cause joined to cause\nbrings about each thing, ceaselessly flowing for eternity\u2019\n(Cicero De divinatione I 125; Gellius Noctes Atticae\n7.2.1-3 = L&S 55 K). To maintain that all things are fated in this\ncontext is to hold that every event is the effect of antecedent causes\nsufficient to bring it about. In other words, the Stoics were\ndeterminists. And they accepted some of the familiar implications of\ndeterminism, e.g, that a sufficiently powerful intellect with a\ncomplete grasp of the state of the world would be able to predict\nevery future event (De divinatione I 127 = LS 55 O). They\nalso confronted the familiar problems that determinism seems to\npresent. If human beings are parts of a deterministic universe and\ntheir every action is the pre-determined effect of causes antecedent\nto their existence, there is a plausible argument that all our actions\nare involuntary, that as it was often put in the ancient debate,\nnothing is up to us or in our power. In no case could we have done\nother than what we did. And from this it would seem to follow that we\nare not responsible for our actions and, with this, that there is no\nscope for blame or punishment, which presuppose that we can be held\nmorally responsible for at least some of what we do. They solved this\nproblem to their own satisfaction by defending the first properly\narticulated\n compatibilist theory,\n according to which voluntary action is compatible with\ndeterminism.\n\nEpicurus and his followers, by contrast, accepted that if all things\nare fated, then all our actions are involuntary, from which it follows\nthat we are responsible for none of them. They preserved the voluntary\nand moral responsibility by rejecting fate, notoriously postulating\nthe swerve, occasional random uncaused atomic motions (De\nfato 21-2; cf. Lucretius DRN 2.251-93 = LS 20 F).\n\nLike the Stoics, the Epicureans were also occupied with we may call\nlogical determinism. According to the principle of bivalence, every\nproposition P is either true or false. If there is a future tense\nproposition predicting every future occurrence before it\nhappens\u2013it doesn\u2019t matter whether it has ever been\nexpressed\u2013true at all times before the event, it would seem that\nthe future is fixed or settled. Aristotle tackled this problem in\nDe Interpretatione 9, though it is unclear whether the\nparties to the Hellenistic debate were familiar with his contribution.\nThough an argument for the pre-determination of the future from\nbivalence alone is possible (there may be hints at De fato\n21, 29), in Cicero\u2019s presentation of the issues, the role of the\nprinciple of bivalence is to lend support to causal determinism. The\nidea seems to be that the truth of a proposition at a given time\ndepends on the state of the world at that time and that the facts\nabout the world that bear on the truth of a future tense prediction\nmust be about causes then operative sufficient to bring about the\npredicted event.\n\nCarneades\u2019 most noteworthy contribution to the debate was to\nreject the connection, accepted by both schools, between the principle\nof bivalence and causal determinism. These, he argued, were separate\nissues. To affirm that a suitably formulated statement about the\nfuture that is true cannot become false implies nothing about fate,\nbut is merely an explanation of the meaning of the words employed\n(De fato 20; cf. 27-8). The Stoics were not obliged to\nembrace determinism by accepting bivalence and were not entitled to\ncite bivalence as a ground for their commitment to determinism; the\nEpicureans were not under an obligation to repudiate bivalence because\nthey rejected fate (De fato 20; cf. 32-3).\n\nEven though his proposal would have freed the Epicureans to defend the\nswerve without the need to reject a fundamental principle of logic,\nCarneades was strongly critical of the swerve. The position that he\nput forward as an alternative was supposed to show how the Epicureans\ncould uphold their cause without the swerve (De fato 23; cf.\n47-8). It raises interpretive problems that reflect both the intrinsic\ndifficulty of the issues and the imperfect state of our sources. The\ncause of the Epicureans to which Carneades promises to lend support is\nthe rejection of fate, i.e., the view that every event is the effect\nof antecedent causes sufficient to bring it about. But the error from\nwhich he would save them is the postulation of uncaused motion, which\nis entailed by the swerve. According to Carneades, there is a way in\nwhich it can be truly said that there is motion without cause and a\nway in which it is false (De fato 24).\n\nHe offers an analogy designed to appeal to the Epicureans. In\nEpicurean physics atoms move downwards in straight lines unless\ndisturbed by collisions with other atoms (collisions that are set in\ntrain by atomic swerves). The downward motion of the atoms is without\na cause if we mean action exerted on them from outside, but their\nmotion is not unqualifiedly uncaused, for it is their nature to move\nas they do (De fato 25). The voluntary motions of our\nmind\u2013our volitions\u2013are like this, not the effect of\nexternal causes (though there will be external occasions, or as we\nmight say precipitating causes, for them).\n\nHis thought seems to be that the mind possesses a certain autonomy.\nExplanations of an agent\u2019s actions are always available after\nthe fact. \u2018The outcome reveals its causes\u2019 (De\nfato 37). Explanations for voluntary action do not terminate, as\nthey arguably would if the Epicureans were right about the swerve, in\nuncaused motions, and we are not, as it might then seem, playthings of\nchance. Rather it is the nature of the mind, and the characteristics\nof the minds of the agents who act, which are the causes of their\nvoluntary actions. But it is not because our actions are\npredetermined, not because they are fated, that we act as we do.\n\nHow effective Carneades\u2019 version of autonomous mental causation\nwas at disarming the determinist intuitions of his\nopponents\u2013then and now\u2013is another matter, of course.\n",
