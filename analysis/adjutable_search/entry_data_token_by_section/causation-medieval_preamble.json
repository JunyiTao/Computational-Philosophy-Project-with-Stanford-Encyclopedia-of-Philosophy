    "main_text": "\n\nCausality plays an important role in medieval philosophical writing:\nthe dominant genre of medieval academic writing was the commentary on\nan authoritative work, very often a work of Aristotle. Of the works of\nAristotle thus commented on, the Physics plays a central\nrole.  Other of Aristotle\u2019s scientific works \u2013 On the\nHeavens and the Earth, On Generation and Corruption,\nand, of course, the Metaphysics \u2013 are also significant\nfor the study of causation: so there is a rather daunting body of work\nto survey. \n\nOne might, though, be tempted to argue that this concentration on\ncausality is simply an effect of reading Aristotle, but this would be\ntoo hasty. Medieval thinkers were attracted to the problem of\ncausality long before most of Aristotle\u2019s texts became available\nin the thirteenth century: already in the twelfth century the created\nuniverse was seen as a rational manifestation of God (Wetherbee 1988,\np. 25), and, consequently, the rational investigation of the universe\nwas seen as a way of approaching God: \u201cIn the creation of\nthings\u201d, says William of Conches, \u201cdivine power, wisdom\nand goodness are beheld\u201d (William of Conches, Glosa super\nPlatonem, p. 60). This consideration of the relation between the\nnatural world and God continues throughout the Middle Ages: for\nexample, Duns Scotus\u2019 proof of the existence of God is an a\nposteriori modal proof, based on the notion of causality (Craig\n1980; Normore 2003; Ross and Bates 2003).\n\nThus, apart from direct literary influence, the nature of the\nphilosophical and theological themes which were popular in the Middle\nAges also led to an emphasis on causality. Writers studied the\ninterrelationship of divine grace and natural processes, the role of\nthe will in ethics, free will and determinism: all of these problems\nhave an important causal component.  Similarly, they investigated the\nnature of the causal processes involved in human and animal\nperception.  These questions were often handled by methods which might\nseem to us to be extraordinarily naturalistic \u2013 naturalistic, of\ncourse, in the sense of the modes of natural investigation which were\ncurrent at the time. It comes as no surprise to know that many\nmedieval thinkers discussed the question of whether divine grace can\nincrease: what is surprising is that many of the discussions\nuse the technical tools of Aristotle\u2019s physical and biological\nworks, tools which were originally developed to discuss problems of\ncontinuity and change in the natural world.  What is even more\nsurprising is the technical proficiency of many of these discussions:\nfourteenth-century work on this topic gave rise to very acute analyses\nof the variation of continuous quantities (see Murdoch 1975), and this\nstudy of continuous variation played an important role in the\ndevelopment of the calculus.\n\n\nWhat should become evident during this survey is the extremely tight\nand complex interconnection between medieval causal theories and\nmedieval ontology. After Aristotle\u2019s texts had been assimilated,\nalmost all medieval academic theories had an ontology which was\nbasically hylomorphic: substances were composites of matter and form,\nand change was described as the loss of one form and the acquisition\nof another.  Form was not merely shape, but an active principle: the\nform of a thing was responsible for its causal role (White 1984; Goddu\n1999, p. 148).  Furthermore, in any causal interaction, the allocation\nof active and passive roles to the individuals involved tended to be\nthought of as unproblematic. Although many aspects of Aristotle\u2019s\ncausal theories were extensively and critically debated, this basic\nhylomorphism persisted throughout; and it is this, rather than\nanything more arcane, which often poses the greatest problems in\nassimilating, or evaluating, medieval thought on these topics.\n",
