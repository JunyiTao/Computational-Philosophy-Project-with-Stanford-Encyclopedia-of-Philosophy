    "main_text": "Early Action-Based Theories || Lotze, Helmholtz, and the Local Sign Doctrine\n1.3 Lotze, Helmholtz, and the Local Sign Doctrine\n\nLike Berkeley, Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) and Hermann von\nHelmholtz (1821\u20131894) affirm the role played by active movement\nand touch in the genesis of three-dimensional visuospatial\nawareness:\n\n\n\u2026there can be no possible sense in speaking of any other truth\nof our perceptions other than practical truth. Our\nperceptions of things cannot be anything other than symbols, naturally\ngiven signs for things, which we have learned to use in order to\ncontrol our motions and actions. When we have learned to read those\nsigns in the proper manner, we are in a condition to use them to\norient our actions such that they achieve their intended effect; that\nis to say, that new sensations arise in an expected manner\n(Helmholtz 2005 [1924]: 19, our emphasis).\n\n\nLotze and Helmholtz go further than Berkeley in maintaining that\nbodily movement also plays a role in the construction of the\ntwo-dimensional visual field, taken for granted by most previous\naccounts of vision (but for exceptions, see Hatfield 1990: ch. 4).\n\nThe problem of two-dimensional spatial localization, as Lotze and\nHelmholtz understand it, is the problem of assigning a unique,\neye-relative (or \u201coculocentric\u201d) direction to every point\nin the visual field. Lotze\u2019s commitment to mind-body dualism\nprecluded looking to any physical or anatomical spatial ordering in\nthe visual system for a solution to this problem (Lotze 1887 [1879]:\n\u00a7\u00a7276\u201377). Rather, Lotze maintains that every discrete\nvisual impression is attended by a \u201cspecial extra\nsensation\u201d whose phenomenal character varies as a function of\nits origin on the retina. Collectively, these extra sensations or\n\u201clocal signs\u201d constitute a \u201csystem of graduated,\nqualitative tokens\u201d (1887 [1879]: \u00a7283) that bridge the gap\nbetween the spatial structure of the nonconscious retinal image and\nthe spatial structure represented in conscious visual awareness.\n\nWhat sort of sensation, however, is suited to play the individuating\nrole attributed to a local sign? Lotze appeals to kinaesthetic\nsensations that accompany gaze-directing movements of the eyes (1887\n[1879]: \u00a7\u00a7284\u201386). If P is the location on\nthe retina stimulated by a distal point d and F is\nthe fovea, then PF is the arc that must be traversed in order\nto align the direction of gaze with d. As the eye moves\nthrough arc PF, its changing position gives rise to a\ncorresponding series of kinaesthetic sensations\np0, p1,\np2, \u2026pn, and\nit is this consciously experienced series, unique to P, that\nconstitutes P\u2019s local sign. By contrast, if Q\nwere rather the location on the retina stimulated by d, then\nthe eye\u2019s foveating movement through arc QF would\nelicit a different series of kinaesthetic sensations\nk0, k1,\nk2, \u2026kn unique\nto Q.\n\nImportantly, Lotze allows that retinal stimulation need not trigger an\novert movement of the eye. Rather, even in the absence of the\ncorresponding saccade, stimulating point P will elicit\nkinaesthetic sensation p0, and this sensation\nwill, in turn, recall from memory the rest of the series with which it\nis associated p1,\n\u2026pn.\n\n\nAccordingly, though there is no movement of the eye, there arises the\nrecollection of something, greater or smaller, that must be\naccomplished if the stimuli at P and Q, which arouse\nonly a weak sensation, are to arouse sensations of the highest degree\nof strength and clearness. (1887 [1879]: \u00a7285)\n\n\nIn this way, Lotze accounts for our ability to perceive multiple\nlocations in the visual field at the same time.\n\nHelmholtz 2005 [1924] fully accepts the need for local signs in\ntwo-dimensional spatial localization, but makes an important\nmodification to Lotze\u2019s theory. In particular, he maintains that\nlocal signs are not feelings that originate in the adjustment of the\nocular musculature, i.e., a form of afferent, sensory\n\u201cinflow\u201d from the eyes, but rather feelings of innervation\n(Innervationsgef\u00fchlen) produced by the effort of the\nwill (Willensanstrengung) to move the eyes, i.e., a form of\nefferent, motor \u201coutflow\u201d. In general, to each perceptible\nlocation in the visual field there is an associated readiness or\nimpulse of the will (Willensimpuls) to move eyes in the\nmanner required in order to fixate it. As Ernst Mach later formulates\nHelmholtz\u2019s view: \u201cThe will to perform movements of the\neyes, or the innervation to the act, is itself the space\nsensation\u201d (Mach 1897 [1886]: 59).\n\nHelmholtz favored a motor outflow version of the local sign doctrine\nfor two main reasons. First, he was skeptical that afferent\nregistrations of eye position are precise enough to play the role\nassigned to them by Lotze\u2019s theory (2005 [1924]: 47\u201349).\nRecent research has shown that proprioceptive inflow from ocular\nmuscular stretch receptors does in fact play a quantifiable role in\nestimating direction of gaze, but efferent outflow is normally the\nmore heavily weighted source of information (Bridgeman 2010; see\n Section 2.1.1\n below).\n\nSecond, attempting a saccade when the eyes are paralyzed or otherwise\nimmobilized results in an apparent shift of the visual scene in the\nsame direction (Helmholtz 2005 [1924]: 205\u201306; Mach 1897 [1886]:\n59\u201360). This finding would make sense if efferent signals to the\neye are used to determine the direction of gaze: the visual system\n\u201cinfers\u201d that perceived objects are moving because they\nwould have to be in order for retinal stimulation to remain constant\ndespite the change in eye direction predicted on the basis of motor\noutflow.\n\nAlthough Helmholtz was primarily concerned to show that \u201cour\njudgments as to the direction of the visual axis are simply the result\nof the effort of will involved in trying to alter the adjustment of\nthe eyes\u201d (2005 [1924]: 205\u201306), the evidence he adduces\nalso implies that efferent signals play a critical role in our\nperception of stability in the world across saccadic eye movements. In\nthe next section, we trace the influence of this idea on theories in\nthe 20th century.\n",
