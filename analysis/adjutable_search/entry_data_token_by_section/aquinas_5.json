    "main_text": "Soul and Body\n5. Soul and Body\n\nFor living things, their substantial form is their soul\n(anima). In saying this, Aquinas should not be understood to\nbe ascribing some special sort of spirituality to plants and animals:\nhe thinks they are material objects just as much as rocks and streams\nare. Rather, he is following the lead of Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima in treating the soul as the first principle of life,\nwhatever that may be. Since Aquinas thinks that the primary internal\nexplanation for the existence of any substance is its substantial form\n(\u00a74), it follows that every living substance has a soul that is\nits substantial form.\n\nAs with any substantial form, the primary function of a soul is to\naccount for the substance\u2019s nature as a certain kind of thing,\npossessed of the unity and persistence that characterizes substances.\nThis actualizing role is what Aquinas calls the soul\u2019s essence\n(ST 1a 77.1c). The ongoing existence of living things also\nrequires that they carry out distinctive operations: taking\nnourishment and reproducing, moving and perceiving (in the case of\nanimals), and reasoning (in the human case). Corresponding to these\noperations are the powers of the soul. Medieval authors had long\npuzzled over the relationship between the soul and its powers. Aquinas\ntakes a strong position that would be the subject of much later\ndispute: that the soul\u2019s powers, being potentialities, are\nreally distinct from the soul\u2019s essence, which is an actuality\n(ST 1a 77, Quest. on the Soul 12).\n\nYet even though Aquinas insists on a distinction between the soul and\nits powers, he rejects the common medieval view that living things\nhave multiple souls or multiple substantial forms. Because of his\ncommitment to the absolute unity of a substance, he thinks that\nnothing could count as a substance unless it possesses a unique\nsubstantial form that provides unity, at a time and over time, to the\nsubstance as a whole.\n\nOne thing simpliciter is produced out of many actually\nexisting things only if there is something uniting and in some way\ntying them to each other. In this way, then, if Socrates were an\nanimal and were rational in virtue of different forms, then these two,\nin order to be united simpliciter, would need something to\nmake them one. Therefore, since nothing is available to do this, the\nresult will be that a human being is one thing only as an aggregate,\nlike a heap. (Quest. on the Soul 11c; also ST 1a\n76.3\u20134, Quest. on Spiritual Creatures 3)\n\n\nSuch remarks engendered a long dispute between those who favored this\nsort of \u201cunitarian\u201d approach and those who took one or\nanother \u201cpluralist\u201d position. The pluralists argued that\nliving things contain one substantial form for their body (their\nbodily form, forma corporeitatis) and at least one further\ndistinct form, their soul, in virtue of which they have life (Adams\n1987 ch. 15; Cross 1998 ch. 4; Pasnau 2011 ch. 25). The principal\nargument in favor of pluralism was that it explained how the body of a\nliving thing could persist after the departure of the living\nthing\u2019s soul at death. Aquinas and other unitarians claimed that\nsuch persistence was merely apparent, and that strictly speaking the\nonly thing that endures through a substance\u2019s corruption is\nprime matter.\n\nGiven the tight connection that Aquinas describes between form and\nmatter, it is hard to characterize his theory of souls in general as\n dualistic.\n To be sure, in some sense, material substances are a composite of\nsubstantial form and prime matter (with accidents on the outside, so\nto speak, unified only accidentally with the substance). Still,\nAquinas takes pains to stress that it is the substance as a whole that\nproperly exists. And he definitely does not think that material\nsubstances are a composite of form and body, since the\nmaterial substance is the body. His unitarian framework\ndeliberately makes it incoherent to speak of the body of a living\nthing (or of any substance) as something distinct from that\nsubstance.\n\nThe situation is much more complex, however, when we focus on the\nhuman case. If a dualist is someone who thinks that human beings\nconsist in a material body and an immaterial, spiritual mind, then\nAquinas clearly qualifies, even if he works very hard to get the\nresult that these two aspects of human nature are unified as a single\nsubstance (Baz\u00e1n 1997; Klima 1997 [2002]; Stump 2003 ch. 6).\nAlthough the human soul\u2019s essential role is to actualize a human\nbody, the human soul has a power\u2014its intellect\u2014that\noperates independently of the body. Aquinas has a variety of much\ndiscussed arguments aimed at showing that human thought, given its\nuniversal scope and abstract content, cannot be carried out through\nthe brain or any other bodily instrument (ST 1a 75.2, 75.5;\nQuest. on the Soul 2; Klima 2001; Wood 2020). As a result,\nthe human soul has a unique and puzzling status: it is both the form\nof a body and \u201can incorporeal and subsistent principle\u201d\n(ST 1a 75.2c). From here, Aquinas further argues that the\nhuman soul is incorruptible (ST 1a 75.6, Quest. on the\nSoul 14). For although ordinary subsistent things\u2014material\nsubstances\u2014routinely come into and go out of existence, with the\ncorruption of their bodies, a subsistent entity that is not a body has\nno natural basis for its ceasing to exist. Hence, once God creates a\nhuman soul (in coordination with the biological process of sexual\nreproduction), that soul exists forever.\n\nGiven that the human body is corrupted at death, the soul\u2019s\nincorruptibility entails that, after death, it will continue to exist\nwithout the body. Aquinas devotes considerable attention to the\nquestion of how it will function in that separated state (ST\n1a 89; Quest. on the Soul 15\u201320). Prior to the delicate\nbut all-important question of what such lives will be like (a paradise\nor a hell), there is a still more basic question of whether a human\nperson\u2019s separated soul continues to be that same person. Recent\ncommentators have been divided. Aquinas is very clear that, in this\nlife, a human being is the whole composite substance, form and matter\n(ST 1a 75.4). Also clear is that Aquinas thinks our souls\nwill not be separated from their bodies forever; in the fullness of\ntime, on the Day of Judgment, they will be reunited with their\nresurrected bodies (SCG IV.79\u201397). The situation\nbecomes less clear, however, when Aquinas argues, as he repeatedly\ndoes, that a resurrection of bodies is required because otherwise\nwe would not survive. \u201cAbraham\u2019s soul\u2019s\nhaving life would not suffice for Abraham\u2019s being alive\u2026.\nThe life of the whole compound is required, soul and body\u201d\n(Sentences IV.43.1.1.1 ad 2). This seems to show\nthat Aquinas thinks a person\u2019s soul, surviving apart from its\nbody, is not sufficient for that person\u2019s survival, and some\nscholars (the \u201ccorruptionists\u201d) read Aquinas in this way\n(Toner 2009; Van Dyke 2012; Nevitt 2014). But to others (the\n\u201csurvivalists\u201d) this looks like an incredible result, in\ntension with claims that Aquinas makes elsewhere and with fundamental\nChristian doctrine (Brown 2007; Brower 2014 ch. 12; Stump 2022).\n",
