    "main_text": "Simpson\u2019s Paradox and Causal Inference || Probabilistic Causality and Simpson\u2019s Paradox\n3.1 Probabilistic Causality and Simpson\u2019s Paradox\n\nEarly accounts of probabilistic causation (e.g., Reichenbach 1956;\nSuppes 1970) sought to explicate causal claims purely in terms of\nprobabilistic and temporal facts. On Suppes\u2019 (1970) account,\nevent \\(\\r{C}\\) is a prima facie cause of \\(\\r{E}\\) if and\nonly if (i) \\(\\r{C}\\) occurs before \\(\\r{E}\\) and (ii) \\(\\r{C}\\)\nraises the probability of\n \\(\\r{E}\\).[2]\n As we have already seen in\n Section 2.1,\n not all prima facie causes are genuine causes. If I drink a\nstrong blond Belgian beer now, I will probably be happy during the\nday, but also have a headache tomorrow. However, being happy would not\nthereby by the cause of the headache: the correlation is explained by\nthe common cause\u2014the beer drinking. The variable for drinking\nthe beer screens off the probabilistic relationship between\nits effects, meaning that the effects will be uncorrelated when one\nconditions on it. The crux of Suppes\u2019 account is that a\nprima facie causal relationship between \\(\\r{C}\\) and\n\\(\\r{E}\\) is a genuine causal relationship iff there is no factor F\nprior to C that screens off \\(\\r{C}\\) from\n \\(\\r{E}\\).[3]\n\nLater theorists such as Cartwright (1979) and Eells (1991) developed\nthis condition by making causal claims relative to a causally\nhomogenous background context, which is specified by a set of\nvariables \\(\\b{K}\\). Consider the following example of association\nreversal presented by Cartwright. Supposing that smoking \\((\\r{S})\\)\nis a cause of heart disease \\((\\r{H})\\), one might expect that smoking\nwould raise the probability of heart disease. Yet this might not be\nthe case. Suppose that in a population there is a strong correlation\nbetween smoking and exercising (X), and that exercise lowers the\nprobability of heart disease by more than smoking raises its\nprobability. In such a case, smoking might lower the probability of\nheart disease although conditional on either \\(X\\) or \\(\\neg X\\),\n\\(\\r{S}\\) raises \\(\\r{H}\\)\u2019s probability.\n\nCartwright interprets this case as follows: causes always raise the\nprobability of their effects, but this can be \u201cconcealed\u201d\nby the correlation between the cause and some other variable (here,\n\\(X\\)). In order to isolate the genuine probabilistic relationship\nbetween \\(\\r{C}\\) and \\(\\r{E}\\), one needs to consider it in a context\nwhere such correlations cannot occur:\n\n\nProbabilistic Causality (Cartwright) Let\n\\(\\b{K}\\) denote all and only the causes of \\(\\r{E}\\) other than\n\\(\\r{C}\\) and effects of \\(\\r{C}\\). Then \\(\\r{C}\\) causes\n\\(\\r{E}\\) if and only if relative to all combinations of values\nvariables in \\(\\b{K}\\), \\(\\r{C}\\) raises the probability of \\(\\r{E}\\):\n\\(p(\\r{C}\\mid \\r{E},\\b{K}) > p(\\r{C}\\mid\n\\neg{\\r{E},\\b{K}})\\).\n\n\nWhile Suppes defends a reductive account of probabilistic\ncausality, where the elements of \\(\\b{K}\\) are determined without\nappeal to causal assumptions, Cartwright presents a\nnon-reductive account where \\(\\b{K}\\) must include all and\nonly the causes of \\(\\r{E}\\), excluding \\(C\\) itself and any variables\nthat are causally intermediate between \\(\\r{C}\\) and \\(\\r{E}\\). The\ncurrent consensus is that it is impossible to give a probabilistic\naccount of causation without relying and causal concepts, and thus\nthat no non-reductive account is feasible (though see Spohn 2012 for\na dissenting view).\n\nAlthough non-reductive accounts could not be used to explain causation\nto someone with no prior causal knowledge, they can nevertheless\nclarify how causal claims are tested, and illuminate the relationship\nbetween causation and probability (see also Woodward 2003:\n20\u201322). Moreover, Cartwright argues that her general criterion\nfor inclusion of background factors in \\(\\b{K}\\) avoids the\nreference class problem for purely statistical\naccounts of causal explanation (i.e., by specifying the relevant\npopulations for evaluating causal claims), thereby eliminating a\nthreat to the objectivity of causal explanation. More detail is\nprovided in the\n entry on probabilistic causality.\n",
