    "main_text": "The Animal Soul, Moral Laws, and Immortality\n8. The Animal Soul, Moral Laws, and Immortality \n\nAt the beginning the Essay, Condillac demonstrated that the\nsoul is immaterial, in opposition to Locke\u2019s hypothesis of\nthinking matter. According to Condillac, God cannot give to matter the\npower to think. The operations of thought show by themselves the unity\nof consciousness, and the unity of consciousness is only accountable\nby presupposing a simple and indivisible subject of inherence for\nconsciousness itself. Condillac presents this line of argument by\nsaying that individual perceptions are indivisible in their nature and\nso they cannot inhere in different substances. Even assuming that each\nindividual perception inheres in a separate individual substance, the\nact of comparing perceptions could not occur without a simple and\nindivisible substratum. \u201cHowever, a mass matter is not one; it\nis a multitude\u201d or, as Condillac also said, matter is an\nassemblage or collection of things (Essay I.i.1 \u00a76).\nTherefore, the soul must be an immaterial substance.\n\nAt the same time, Condillac made clear that after the fall of the\nfirst man and woman the soul has become dependent on the body: the\nbuilding blocks of mental life, sensations, are occasioned by various\nphysical motions caused by the external objects affecting the senses\nand the nervous system (Essay I.i.1 \u00a78). If higher\ncognitive functions are ultimately to be explained merely in terms of\ntransformations of sensations, then Condillac was left with the\nproblem of showing the precise line of demarcation between humans and\nother animals. Two solutions to this problem were foreclosed to\nCondillac. One possible solution was the view of Aristotle: the human\nsoul is characterized by a higher rational part in addition to the\nvegetative and animal parts (the vegetative part being responsible for\nnutrition and growth, and the animal part being responsible for\nsensation and motion). Condillac\u2019s sensism argued precisely\nagainst this essentialist view of the difference between higher and\nlower cognitive functions and by extension against the essentialist\nview of the difference between humans and animals. The second\nsolution, which in Condillac\u2019s times was proposed by Buffon in his\nNatural History (1749-53), was the Cartesian hypothesis of a\nmechanical soul. According to Descartes, only the rational soul is\nresponsible for consciousness. Animals, being devoid of this kind of\nsoul, are mere machines and thus incapable of being conscious.\nCondillac, on his part, was rather inclined to endorse the\ncommon-sense view that makes animals capable of sensation and thus of\nconsciousness.\n\nIn the Essay, Condillac had identified the use of language as\nnecessary for higher cognitive functions, including memory, the\ncontrol of the imagination, and reflection. Animals, which at best\nhave the use of natural signs, can only recall (imagine) absent\nobjects if a present object has been habitually associated with them.\nUnable to use at will signs standing for absent objects, they are\nwithout memory. Thus they live from moment to moment, without any\nproper notion of a continued past existence in which various events\nare connected. Everyday is like a new day for them, and they simply\nrepeat habitual patterns of behaviour most conducive to their\nsurvival. They are at best capable of what Condillac calls\n\u2018reminiscence\u2019 and thus they can recognize an object as\npreviously experienced. The case of a boy who grew up among bears in\nthe woods between Lithuania and Poland appeared to provide\nconfirmation for animals\u2019 mental inferiority: found unable to\nspeak, this youth only gradually learned the language, and afterwards\ncould not recall his past life nor did he have any notion of having\nspent many years in the woods (Essay I.iv.2\n\u00a7\u00a723-25). Another case, that of a deaf-and-dumb boy who\nsuddenly recovered his hearing, further confirmed Condillac\u2019s\nhypothesis: after a period of learning, the boy confirmed that while\nhe was deaf he could not attach any meaning to the sign of the cross\nthat he saw his parents doing, nor did he have any notion of death,\nlife after death, or God (Essay I.iv.2 \u00a7\u00a713-22).\n(Condillac regretted that the examiners of the case had asked the boy\nmerely about his religious beliefs.) Subsequently, as is evident in\nhis correspondence with Cramer and Maupertuis, Condillac had come to\nbelieve that he had drawn too sharp a line between lower and higher\ncognitive functions and that thus he had in effect reintroduced a\ndualism of reason and sensation in the mind.\n\nCondillac addressed this problem in the Treatise of\nSensations by recognizing a level of pre-linguistic reflection\nthat is common to animals and human beings. At the same time,\nCondillac insisted drawing a distinction between the pre-linguistic\ncapacities of human beings and those of animals. He described at\nlength how the statue acquires the ideas of extended objects by touch\nand how it comes to refer the causes of sensations received by the\nother senses to these objects. Touch is considered as a sort of\npre-linguistic instrument of analysis: it originally discriminates\nparts outside of parts in its objects and by its means, sensations\nbecome ideas, that is, they acquire a reference to external objects.\nCondillac then argued that animals must be inferior to humans because\ntheir sense of touch is not as developed as that of human beings. He\nthought that human hands and fingers are uniquely adapted to receiving\na multiplicity of different impressions and therefore the human sense\nof touch is able to discriminate more accurately the qualities of\nobjects than that of other animals. From this difference of degree,\nCondillac went on to argue for a difference of kind between the soul\nof animals and that of humans: God in his benevolence would not trap a\nsoul capable of superior operations in an inferior body like that of\nanimals; therefore, the soul of animals must be of an inferior kind\n(Treatise, The Plan of This Work, Note).\n\nIn the Treatise of Animals Condillac further developed his\nviews. He repeated what he had said in the Treatise of\nSensations: animals are capable of pre-linguistic reflection,\njust like humans. They judge and compare ideas and by these means\ndiscover how to do things necessary for their survival. By this kind\nof reflection, all animals learn the proper use of their organs, in\norder to flee what is dangerous and search what is useful to them.\nReflection is at the origin of the formation habits, like the one that\nmakes us avoid a falling object that is heavy. As the actions\noriginally done deliberately by reflection are gradually turned into\nhabits, \u201cthe animal touches, sees, walks without reflecting on\nwhat it is doing\u201d (Treatise of Animals, II.1). Thus,\nthe more habits are formed, the less need there is for reflection.\nWhat is called instinct in animals is not an innate pattern of\nbehaviour, but rather a well-developed habit (Treatise of\nAnimals II.5). This habit bears witness to the effort of\ninventive reflection that originally taught animals the use of their\norgans: birds have to learn how build their nests and beavers have to\nlearn how to build their shelters (Treatise of Animals\nII.2).\n\nCondillac, however, thinks animals are less inventive than humans\nbecause they have fewer needs and also \u201cfewer means to multiply\ntheir own ideas and make combinations of all sort\u201d (Treatise\nof Animals, II.2). In different words, animals are more easily\nsatisfied with their lot and they are less intelligent. Contrary to\nwhat many authors say, animals of the same species do not do the same\nthings because they imitate each other. Rather, they all end up doing\nthe same things, because they have the same needs and the same organs\nperfectly suited to the satisfaction of those needs. Thus, each animal\nacquires the same habits as any other animal of the same species,\nwhether placed alone or in company. Paradoxically, humans end up being\ndifferent from each other precisely because they are the only animals\nthat imitate each other. There is relatively little communication of\nideas by way of language among animals: their needs are more limited\nand therefore they do not need to learn from each other as much as\nhumans do. Humans, on the contrary, desire to learn from each other\nmore and so imitate each other. As they communicate more with each\nother, they also discover the differences in their talents and\ninterests and put them to use for themselves and others (Treatise\nof Animals II.3). Animals keep to their subsistence economy,\nwhile humans develop a system of division of labour in order to\nsatisfy their needs: one might start by trying to be a skilled hunter\nlike his neighbour only to discover that he had better leave hunting\nto his neighbor and concentrate on the manufacture of bows and arrows.\nSince, individuals are often placed in different circumstances\nrequiring different solutions, new needs emerge. As new needs emerge,\nuseful discoveries are made and social ties get stronger. Just like in\nthe Essay, the intertwined factors of language and social\nintercourse make humans superior to animals in their capacities.\n\nThe difference between humans and animals is still characterized by\nCondillac as difference of degree. For example, animals have a natural\nlanguage of action, just like humans, and they use it to communicate\nwith each other their needs and to help each other. The signs of this\nlanguage vary among different species not only according to the\ndifferent ideas they have but also according to the variety of organs\n(external conformation) they possess, since these organs condition the\nway ideas can be expressed. Animals of different species whose\nexternal conformation resembles each other can communicate with each\nother, at least to a certain extent: Condillac describes the case of\ndogs that can go as far as understanding not simply the language of\naction but also the language of articulate sounds of humans. But\nanimals whose external conformation is widely different from ours\ncannot communicate with us, as the case of the parrot shows: it can\narticulate sounds, but both his ideas and his language of action is\nwidely different from ours (Treatise of Animals II.4).\n\nCondillac seems to have thought that only humans have organs that\nallow for the language of action to be relatively more expressive,\nthus keeping a kind of parallelism between the cognitive capacities of\nthe mind and the complexity of the structure of the body (a complexity\nnot simply reducible to that of the brain but also including that of\nthe peripheral organs).\n\nWhat ultimately sets apart humans from animals is the knowledge of God\nand morals. In the middle of the Treatise of Animals,\nCondillac inserts a long chapter he claims to have submitted as an\nanonymous dissertation to the Academy of Berlin just a few years\nbefore. Here Condillac proceeds to demonstrate the existence of God.\nCondillac insists on a natural progression of ideas: at first, humans\nrealized that their happiness or unhappiness depended completely on\nexternal causes and posited deities equivalent to the powers of\nnature. Then they came to posit a first cause in order to avoid an\ninfinite regression in explanation of these natural powers. Finally,\nthe presence of design leads them to recognize this cause as\nintelligent and free (Treatise of Animals II.6). While the\ndetails of this chapter are not original, they set the stage for\nCondillac\u2019s moral argument for the immortality of the soul.\n\nCondillac first insists on the spontaneous emergence of moral laws.\nThe more humans reflect on their common needs, the more they realize\nhow necessary it is to help each other and refrain from certain kinds\nof action. Thus \u201cthey come to agree on what is allowed and what\nis forbidden, and their conventions become laws to which action must\nbe subordinated: this is the beginning of morality\u201d\n(Treatise of Animals, II.7). \n\nAt first they think of these laws as conventions they designed to\nenhance their well-being, given the needs that they have and the\nscarcity of means to satisfy them. But as they discover the existence\nof God, they recognize that God, by disposing of everything in nature,\nis the ultimate source of goods and evils that may befall human\nbeings. Moral laws then acquire a providential meaning: by obeying\nthese laws, humans obey God himself, who is the author of nature. The\nlaws of morality are both natural laws and laws of divine institution,\nsince nature is God\u2019s creation. But given that the proportion of\ngoods and evils in this life does not correspond to the merits and\ndemerits of individuals, it is necessary to postulate a life after\ndeath where the just will be rewarded and the wicked will be\npunished.\n\nThus, According to Condillac, the immortality of the human soul is not\na consequence of its immateriality. All created beings, whether\nimmaterial or material, are naturally contingent: \u201cif we\nconsider only the nature of the soul, it can cease to be. Who created\nit can let it go back to nothingness. It will continue to exist only\nbecause God is just. But in this way immortality is guaranteed to the\nsoul as if it were a consequence of its essence\u201d (Treatise\nof Animals II.7). Immortality is guaranteed to the human soul\nsince the human soul is capable of knowing God\u2019s laws and God is\nsupremely just: only in this derivative sense, \u201cimmortality is\nguaranteed to the soul as if it were a consequence of its\nessence.\u201d\n\nUnlike human beings, animals are incapable of knowing moral laws. God\nhas not granted them the means to distinguish between what is right\nand what is wrong and so \u201che has shown that he does not expect\nanything from them\u201d (Treatise of Animals II.7).\n\u201cNothing is enjoined and nothing is forbidden to beasts. Their\nonly rule is force. Incapable of merit and demerit, they have no right\nto divine justice. Their soul is thus mortal\u201d (Treatise of\nAnimals II.7). But the soul of animals is immaterial, just like\nthe one of humans. Thus, we see how Condillac was able to separate the\nquestion of the immateriality of the soul from the question of the\nimmortality of the soul.\n\nAn objection could be raised against Condillac: if small children, who\nare still too young to know moral laws, suffer and die, would they be\nrewarded in the afterlife as compensation for their sufferings? And\nshould we not think the same of animals, who are like small children,\nsuffering and yet incapable of knowledge of moral laws? Condillac\nappears not to have appreciated the strength of this objection: for\nhim, the sufferings of animals are either a means to warn them of\ndanger or a necessary consequence of the laws of nature instituted by\nGod. That an analogy could be drawn to children or mentally disabled\npeople is not considered by Condillac.\n",
