For systems of a great many degrees of freedom, a complete\nspecification of the state of the system may be unavailable or\nunwieldy; classical statistical mechanics deals with such a situation\nby invoking a probability distribution over the state space of the\nsystem. A probability distribution that assigns any probability other\nthan one or zero to some physical quantities is regarded as an\nincomplete specification of the state of the system. In quantum\nmechanics, things are different. There are no quantum states that\nassign definite values to all physical quantities, and probabilities\nare built into the standard formulation of the theory.\n\nIn formulating a quantum theory of some system, one usually begins\nwith the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formulation of the classical\nmechanical theory of that system. In the Hamiltonian formulation of\nclassical mechanics, the configuration of a system is represented by a\nset of coordinates. These could be, for example, the positions of each\nof a set of point particles, but one can also consider more general\ncases, such as angular coordinates that specify the orientation of a\nrigid body. For every coordinate there is an associated conjugate\nmomentum. If the coordinate indicates the position of some\nobject, the momentum conjugate to that coordinate may be what we\nusually call \u201cmomentum,\u201d that is, the velocity of the body\nmultiplied by its mass. If the coordinate is an angle, the momentum\nconjugate to it is an angular momentum.\n\nConstruction of a quantum theory of a physical system proceeds by\nfirst associating the dynamical degrees of freedom with\noperators. These are mathematical objects on which operations\nof multiplication and addition are defined, as well as multiplication\nby real and complex numbers. Another way of saying this is that the\nset of operators forms an algebra. Typically, it is said that\nan operator represents an observable, and the result of an\nexperiment on a system is said to yield a value for some observable.\nTwo or more observables are said to be compatible if there is\nsome possible experiment that simultaneously yields values for all of\nthem. Others require mutually exclusive experiments; these are said to\nbe incompatible.\n\nOf course, in a classical theory, the dynamical quantities that define\na state also form an algebra also, as they can be multiplied and\nadded, and multiplied by real or complex numbers. Quantum mechanics\ndiffers from classical mechanics in that the order of multiplication\nof operators can make a difference.  That is, for some operators\n\\(A\\),\\(B\\), the product \\(AB\\) is not equal to the product \\(BA.\\) If\n\\(AB = BA,\\) the operators are said to commute.\n\nThe recipe for constructing a quantum theory of a given physical\nsystems prescribes algebraic relations between the operators\nrepresenting the dynamical variables of the system. Compatible\nobservables are associated with operators that commute with each\nother. Operators representing conjugate variables are required to\nsatisfy what are called the canonical commutation relations.\nIf \\(q\\) is some coordinate, and \\(p\\) its conjugate\nmomentum, the operators \\(Q\\) and \\(P\\) representing them\nare required to not commute. Instead, the difference between\n\\(PQ\\) and \\(QP\\) is required to be a multiple of the\nidentity operator (that is, the operator \\(I\\) that satisfies,\nfor all operators \\(A\\), \\(IA = AI).\\)\n\nA quantum state is a specification, for every experiment that\ncan be performed on the system,  of probabilities for the\npossible outcomes of that experiment. These can be summed up as an\nassignment of an expectation value to each observable. These states\nare required to be linear. This means that, if an operator\n\\(C\\), corresponding to some observable, is the sum of operators\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), corresponding to other observables, then\nthe expectation value that a quantum state assigns to \\(C\\) must\nbe the sum of the expectation values assigned to \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\). This is a nontrivial constraint, as it is required to hold\nwhether or not the observables represented are compatible. A quantum\nstate, therefore, relates expectation values for quantities yielded by\nincompatible experiments.\n\nIncompatible observables, represented by noncommuting operators, give\nrise to uncertainty relations; see the entry on\n the uncertainty principle.\n These relations entail that there are no quantum states that assign\ndefinite values to the observables that satisfy them, and place bounds\non how close they can come to be simultaneously well-defined in any\nquantum state.\n\nFor any two distinct quantum states, \\(\\rho\\), \\(\\omega\\), and any\nreal number between 0 and 1, there is a corresponding mixed\nstate. The probability assigned to any experimental outcome by\nthis mixed state is \\(p\\) times the probability it is assigned by\n\\(\\rho\\) plus \\(1-p\\) times the probability assigned to it by\n\\(\\omega\\). One way to physically realize the preparation of a mixed\nstate is to employ a randomizing device, for example, a coin with\nprobability \\(p\\) of landing heads and probability \\(1-p\\) of\nlanding tails, and to use it to choose between preparing state\n\\(\\rho\\) and preparing state \\(\\omega\\). We will see another way to\nprepare a mixed state after we have discussed entanglement, in section\n3. A state that is not a mixture of any two distinct states is called\na pure state.\n\nIt is both useful and customary, though not strictly necessary, to\nemploy a Hilbert space representation of a quantum theory. In\nsuch a representation, the operators corresponding to observables are\nrepresented as acting on elements of an appropriately constructed\nHilbert space (see the entry on\n quantum mechanics\n for details). Usually, the Hilbert space representation is\nconstructed in such a way that vectors in the space represent pure\nstates; such a representation is called an irreducible\nrepresentation. Irreducible representations, in which mixed\nstates are also represented by vectors, are also possible.\n\nA Hilbert space is a vector space. This means that, for any two\nvectors \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\), \\(|\\phi\\rangle\\) , in the space,\nrepresenting pure states, and any complex numbers \\(a\\),\n\\(b\\), there is another vector,  \\(a |\\psi\\rangle + b\n|\\phi\\rangle\\), that also represents a pure state. This is called a\nsuperposition of the states represented by \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\)\nand \\(|\\phi\\rangle\\) . Any vector in a Hilbert space can be written as\na superposition of other vectors in infinitely many ways. Sometimes,\nin discussing the foundations of quantum mechanics, authors fall into\ntalking as if some state are superpositions and others are not. This\nis simply an error. Usually what is meant is that some states yield\ndefinite values for macroscopic observables, and others cannot be\nwritten in any way that is not a superposition of macroscopically\ndistinct states.\n\nThe noncontroversial operational core of quantum theory consists of\nrules for identifying, for any given system, appropriate operators\nrepresenting its dynamical quantities. In addition, there are\nprescriptions for evolving the state of system when it is acted upon\nby specified external fields or subjected to various manipulations\n(see\n section 1.3).\n Application of quantum theory typically involves a distinction\nbetween the system under study, which is treated quantum mechanically,\nand experimental apparatus, which is not. This division is sometimes\nknown as the Heisenberg cut.\n\nWhether or not we can expect to be able to go beyond the\nnoncontroversial operational core of quantum theory, and take it to be\nmore than a means for calculating probabilities of outcomes of\nexperiments, remains a topic of contemporary philosophical\ndiscussion.\n",
