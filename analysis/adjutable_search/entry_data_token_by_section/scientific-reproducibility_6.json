    "main_text": "Meta-Science: Establishing, Monitoring, and Evaluating the Reproducibility Crisis || Publication Bias, Low Statistical Power and Inflated False Positive Rates\n2.2 Publication Bias, Low Statistical Power and Inflated False Positive Rates\n\nThe causes of irreproducible results are largely the same across\ndisciplines we have mentioned. This is not surprising given that they\nstem from problems with statistical methods, publishing practices and\nthe incentive structures created in a \u201cpublish or perish\u201d\nresearch culture, all of which are largely shared, at least in the\nlife and behavioral sciences.\n\nWhilst replication is often casually referred to as a cornerstone of\nthe scientific method, direct replication studies (as they might be\nunderstood from Schmidt or G\u00f3mez, Juristo, and Vegas\u2019s\ntypologies above) are a rare event in the published literature of some\nscientific disciplines, most notably the life and social sciences. For\nexample, such replication attempts constitute roughly 1% of the\npublished psychology literature (Makel, Plucker, & Hegarty 2012).\nThe proportion in published ecology and evolution literature is even\nsmaller (Kelly 2017, Other Internet Resources).\n\nThis virtual absence of replication studies in the literature can\nexplained by the fact that many scientific journals have historically\nhad explicit policies against publishing replication studies (Mahoney\n1985)\u2014thus giving rise to a \u201cpublication bias\u201d. Over\n70% of editors from 79 social science journals said they preferred new\nstudies over replications and over 90% said they would did not\nencourage the submission of replication studies (Neuliep &\nCrandall 1990). In addition, many science funding bodies also fund\nonly \u201cnovel\u201d, \u201coriginal\u201d and/or\n\u201cgroundbreaking\u201d research (Schmidt 2009).\n\nA second type of publication bias has also played a substantial role\nin the reproducibility crisis, namely a bias towards\n\u201cstatistically significant\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d\nresults. Unlike the bias against replication studies, this is rarely\nan explicitly stated policy of a journal. Publication bias towards\nstatistically significant findings has a long history, and was first\ndocumented in psychology by Sterling (1959). Developments in text\nmining techniques have led to more comprehensive estimates. For\nexample, Fanelli\u2019s work has demonstrated the extent of\npublication bias in various disciplines, and the proportions of\nstatistically significant results given below are from his 2010a\npaper. He has also documented the increase of this bias over time\n(2012) and explored the causes of the bias, including the relationship\nbetween publication bias and a publish or perish research culture\n(2010b).\n\nIn many disciplines (e.g., psychology, psychiatry, materials science,\npharmacology and toxicology, clinical medicine, biology and\nbiochemistry, economics and business, microbiology and genetics) the\nproportion of statistically significant results is very high, close to\nor exceeding 90% (Fanelli 2010a). This is despite the fact that in\nmany of these fields, the average statistical power is low\u2014that\nis, the average probability that a study will correctly reject the\nnull hypothesis is low. For example, in psychology the proportion of\npublished results that are statistically significant is 92% despite\nthe fact that the average power of studies in this field to detect\nmedium effect sizes (arguably typical of the discipline) is roughly\n44% (Szucs & Ioannidis 2017). If there was no bias towards\npublishing statistically significant results, the proportion of\nsignificant results should roughly match the average statistical power\nof the discipline. The excess in statistical significance (in this\ncase, the difference between 92% and 44%) is therefore an indicator\nthe strength of the bias. For a second example, in ecology,\nenvironment and plant and animal sciences the proportion of\nstatistically significant results is 74% and 78% respectively,\nadmittedly lower than in psychology. However, the most recent estimate\nof the statistical power, again of medium effect sizes, of ecology and\nanimal behaviour is 23\u201326% (Smith, Hardy, & Gammell 2011)\n(An earlier more optimistic assessment was 40\u201347%, Jennions\n& M\u00f8ller, 2003.) For a third example, the proportion of\nstatistically significant results in neuroscience and behaviour is\n85%. Our best estimate of the statistical power in neuroscience is at\nbest 31%, with a lower bound estimate of 8% (Button et al. 2013). The\nassociated file-drawer problem (Rosenthal 1979)\u2014where\nresearchers relegate failed statistically non-significant studies to\ntheir file drawers, hidden from public view\u2014has long been\nestablished in psychology and others disciplines, and is known to lead\nto distortions in meta-analysis (where a \u201cmeta-analysis\u201d\nis a study which analyses results across multiple other studies).\n",
