    "main_text": "\n\nNatural language ontology is the study of the ontology (ontological\ncategories, structures, and notions) implicit in natural language.\nNatural language ontology is part of \u201cdescriptive\nmetaphysics\u201d to use Strawson\u2019s term (1959), as opposed to\nwhat Fine (2017a) calls \u201cfoundational metaphysics\u201d,\nmetaphysics whose interest is in what there ultimately is. Natural\nlanguage ontology is a sub-discipline of both philosophy and\nlinguistics, more specifically, of metaphysics and natural language\nsemantics. It was recognized as a separate field of study relatively\nrecently, through the development of natural language semantics over\nthe last decades. At the same time, natural language ontology can be\nconsidered a practice that philosophers have engaged in throughout the\nhistory of philosophy when drawing on language in support of a\nmetaphysical argument or notion. The ontology of natural language is\nto be distinguished from the ontology a speaker accepts on the basis\nof philosophical or na\u00efve reflection or reasoning using language,\nas well as from the ontology that is reflected in cognition in\ngeneral. The ontology of a natural language is thus best characterized\nas the ontology competent speakers implicitly accept by way of using\nthe language.\n",
