    "main_text": "Panopticon\n8. Panopticon\n\nSubordinate ends are also evident in the design and management of the\npanopticon prison: security and economy are foremost, but tempered by\nhumanity and accountability. Impressed by the dynamic of its circular\narchitecture which allowed the warden, obscured from view in the\nshuttered watchtower, to observe the activities of prisoners day and\nnight, Michel Foucault took the perspective that\n\u201cpanopticism\u201d defined a \u201cnew physics of\npower\u201d, an experimental \u201claboratory of power\u201d in\nwhich behaviour could be modified, and he viewed the\npanopticon\u2014that \u201ccruel, ingenious cage\u201d\u2014as a\nsymbol of the repressive, disciplinary society, the modern\n\u201csociety of surveillance\u201d (Foucault 208). This view of the\npanopticon has opened up some interesting lines of discourse on the\nencroaching methods of control and surveillance in contemporary\nliberal societies (Brunon-Ernst 2012). However, as a critique of\nBentham\u2019s proposals it hardly does justice to the intricacies of\nthe project, as Semple (1993) has shown.\n\nThe end of economy determined that the panopticon prison should be a\nprivate self-sustaining operation not requiring financial assistance\nfrom the public purse. Security determined that the community be\nprotected from convicted criminals, and severity in punishment was to\nserve the ends of deterrence and reformation. But security also\nrequired that the inmate be protected from cruel treatment, and\nhumanity determined that prisoners should be deprived only of liberty\nnot health or life. Prisoners were to be kept clean and their labour\nmade productive and profitable, including the development of skills\nthat might be useful to them when released. In support of these\nobjectives, Bentham invoked several devices to effect transparency and\naccountability in prison government. The chief mechanism intended to\nbring the interest of the prison owner/administrator in line with his\nduty to be humane is publicity, described as \u201cthe most effectual\nmeans of applying the force of moral motives, in a direction tending\nto strengthen the union between his interest and the humane\nbranch of his duty; by bringing to light, and thus exposing to the\ncensure of the law and of public opinion \u2026 every instance of\ncontravention\u201d (1838\u201343, VIII, 380). To the seemingly\n\u201cconstant\u201d but unseen surveillance of the inmates by the\nwarden, Bentham added the observation of the warden and his\nsubordinates by the public. Interested members of the public and\nmembers of parliament were to be guaranteed free access to the prison,\nmaking the panopticon subject to \u201cthe great open\ncommittee of the tribunal of the world\u201d (1838\u201343, IV,\n46). This was the prototype for Bentham\u2019s later ruminations on\nthe benefits of the Public Opinion Tribunal in a system of\nrepresentative democracy.\n",
