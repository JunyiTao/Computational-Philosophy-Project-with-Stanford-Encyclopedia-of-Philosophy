Ethical Commensurability\n\nConfucianism is a perfectionist virtue ethic if such an ethic is\ndistinguished by its central focus on three subjects: character traits\nidentified as the virtues; the good and worthwhile life; and\nparticularist modes of ethical reasoning. These three subjects are\ninterrelated. The virtues are traits of character necessary for living\na good life. The virtues typically involve acting on particularist\nmodes of ethical reasoning that do not rely on deducing specific\naction-guiding conclusions about how to act from general principles\nbut rather on judging in the context at hand what needs to be done\n(see Van Norden, 2004, 2007, Hutton, 2003, Wong, 2002, and Ivanhoe,\n2002 for discussions of judgment and its relation to reasoning and\nemotion in Mencius). Consider some of the virtues that belong to the\njunzi (the noble person): ren (humanity,\nbenevolence), xiao (filial piety), yi\n(righteousness), and li (acting according to ceremonial\nritual or more generally propriety). The very concept of yi\nconnotes the ability to identify and perform the action that is\nappropriate to the particular context (Analects 4:10 says\nthat the junzi is not predisposed to be for or against\nanything, but rather goes with what is yi). While traditional\nrules of ritual provide one with a sense of what is courteous and\nrespectful action given standard contexts, the virtue of\nyi allows one to identify when those rules need to\nbe set aside in exigent circumstances (see Cua, 1997). The previously\ndiscussed example in the Mencius of Shun and his father shows\nhow a ruler\u2019s more general concern for his subjects and his\nfilial duties to his fathers must be balanced in ways that cannot be\ngiven by principle but only by reflection on what the particular\ncircumstances suggest and allow. Finally, consider that another\nexample from the Mencius about the time when Shun wanted to marry. He\nknew that his parents, not the wisest nor the best of parents, would\nnot permit him to marry if told of Shun\u2019s intention. Shun went\nahead and got married without telling his parents, an act that\nnormally would be a grave offense against filial piety. Two reasons\nare given for the justifiability of this act. One is that the worst\nway of being a bad son is to provide no heir (4A26); the other is that\nletting his parents thwart his desire to realize the greatest of human\nrelationships which in turn would cause bitterness toward his parents\n(5A2). Hence an act that normally would be a grave offense against\nfilial piety constitutes filial piety in the particular circumstances.\nParticularist modes of reasoning are needed, then, to judge when the\nusual rules apply, to balance conflicting values, and to specify the\nconcrete meaning of single values in application to context.\n\nThe parallels to ancient Greek virtue ethics, medieval virtue ethics,\nand also to contemporary virtue ethics in the West are striking, and\nhelp to account for the renewal of Western interest in Confucianism.\nFor example, Jiyuan Yu (2007) argues that the concept of\neudaimonia (happiness, living well, flourishing) in Aristotle\nand the concept of dao (the way for human beings to live) in\nConfucius are parallel starting points in their ethics, and that the\nnext step in both their ethics is to discuss virtue (arete\nfor Aristotle and de for Confucius). In general, Chinese and\nWestern virtue ethics converge in focusing on certain virtues as\ncrucial for ethical development of the person. There are particularly\ninteresting discussions of courage and the possible role of fear in\nMencius and Aristotle (see Van Norden, 1997, 2007; Jiang, 2008).\nParticularist modes of reasoning in Confucianism parallel the\nAristotelian notion of a phronesis or practical wisdom that\ndepends significantly on knowledge of particulars acquired through\nexperience. A good example is his doctrine of the mean, which holds\nthat virtuous action and feeling consists of avoiding the extremes of\ndeficit and excess. The doctrine does not imply that we ought always\nto act moderately and with moderate feeling. Aristotle says that the\nmean is \u201crelative to us,\u201d giving the illustrative analogy\nthat too little food for Milo is too much for the beginner in athletic\nexercises (Nichomachean Ethics, 2.6). Depending on the\nsituation, the appropriate action and feeling may be extreme on a\ncommon sense understanding but appropriate given the agent and the\ncircumstances. Part of the contemporary revival of virtue ethics is\npremised partly on a reaction against the ambition of modern ethical\ntheory to guide primarily through general principles of action rather\nthan through the specification of ideal character traits. Virtue\nethics also tend to embody the theme that the ethical life of right\n(and in the case of Chinese and contemporary Western virtue ethics)\ncaring relationship to others is necessary for human flourishing. In\nthe Mencius this theme emerges in identification of the\ndistinctively human potentials with the incipient tendencies to\ndevelop the moral virtues (Mencius 2A6, 6A1, 6A3, 6A7).\nAristotle held that reason makes us distinctively human and that our\nreason and social nature compel recognition of the desirability of the\nethical life for human beings (see Nivison, 1996 for comparisons of\nAristotle and Mencius; and Yearley, 1990 for comparisons of Aquinas\nand Mencius). Xunzi is equally emphatic about the necessity of right\nand caring relationship to others for human flourishing, even though\nhe denies (at least when he is criticizing Mencius) that human nature\ncontains tendencies to engage in such relationships (see Ivanhoe,\n1991, on the way ethical norms help human beings to flourish; and\nNivison, 1996a, 1996b, Van Norden, 1992, 2007, Wong, 1996b, and Kline,\n2000, on the difference between Mencius and Xunzi\u2019s theories of\nhuman nature; see Goldin, 1999, for a book-length treatment of\nXunzi\u2019s philosophy; and Wong 2015a).\n\nThe similarities coexist with significant differences, however. There\nis no parallel in Greek virtue ethics for the centrality of family\nlife in the Confucian conception of the good life. Part of the reason\nfor this lies in the Confucian appreciation for the family as the\nfirst arena in which care, respect, and deference to legitimate\nauthority is learned (Analects 1.2; see also Cline, 2007,\n2013 for a discussion of the Confucian view of the family in moral\ndevelopment and for an interesting comparison to John Rawls\u2019\nconception of the role of the family). Van Norden (2004, 2007) points\nout that the moral emotion of shame plays a crucial role in\nMencius\u2019 conception of moral development and that there is no\ncomparable role played by the emotion in Aristotle. He suggests that\nthe explanation lies in Mencius\u2019 greater focus on moral agency\nin media res. The way in which particularist reasoning is\nillustrated in historical stories such as those about Shun is also a\ndistinctive feature of Confucian ethics. These stories present\nparadigms of good judgment and of good individuals, from which persons\nengaged in ethical cultivation of themselves should learn. Another\ndistinctive feature of Confucian ethics is the emphasis it gives to an\naesthetic dimension of the good life. To act according to ritual\npropriety is not simply to conform to notions of appropriate behavior\nin this or that context. It is to act with the right attitude,\nreverence, say, in the case of serving one\u2019s parents in an\nappropriately respectful manner, and it is to express such an attitude\nso gracefully and without internal conflict that doing so has become\nsecond nature (see Kupperman, 1999 and Cua, 1997). The importance\nattached to li, to ritual propriety itself, indicates the\nConfucian appreciation for the role of culture and convention in\nenabling human beings to express ethical attitudes toward each another\nsuch as care and respect (see Cua, 2005 for rich explorations of\nli in the thought of Xunzi). It is not as if bowing naturally\nmeans deferential respect; it must be agreed through\nconvention that it does mean something like this (see Fingarette,\n1972; see Shun, 1993, for a discussion of the relationship of\nli to the important virtue of ren). \n\nConfucianism offers a rich moral psychology. Among sinologists,\nNivison (1996; see especially \u201cMotivation and Moral Action in\nMencius,\u201d \u201cPhilosophical Voluntarism in Fourth-Century\nChina,\u201d \u201cTwo Roots or One?\u201d and \u201cXunzi on\n\u2018Human Nature\u2019\u201d) was especially influential in\nmining Confucian texts for insight into moral psychology from a\ncomparative perspective. Van Norden (2017) holds that Confucianism has\na decided edge over modern Western philosophy in terms of presenting\nrich and insightful theories of moral development. On his narrative,\nearly modern Western philosophy abandoned Aristotelian explanations by\nappeal to actualization of potentiality for quantitative explanations\nin terms of material objects in motion. While this was a positive\ndevelopment for the natural sciences, it was a disaster for ethics,\nparticularly in the intersection with moral psychology. It is probably\nnot just the early modern turn in the West toward mechanistic\nquantitative explanations that accounts for the comparative\ndifference. Aristotle\u2019s explanation of the actualization of the\npotential for virtue was relatively skimpy in gesturing toward\nhabituation as the means, whereby one becomes courageous by acting\ncourageously, and so on (Nichomachean Ethics II.1). Xunzi\nseems to have a similar problem when he declares on the one hand that\nhuman nature is bad, with powerful self-seeking and competitive\nimpulses that threaten to throw human being into destructive conflict\nwith one another, and on the other hand, that the performance of\nritual, through following models of virtue, and through a social\nenvironment with roles fashioned to be in accordance with standards of\nrightness (yi), human beings can come to love virtue for its\nown sake. However, Xunzi at one point in his chapter on ritual\nobserves that all creatures of blood and breath (qi) know to\nlove their own kind and long after others of its group if they become\nseparated. Human beings are most of all like this, which is why\nrituals such as mourning and grief for loved ones are so powerful and\nhelp shape our impulses for the better. Ritual, which most of the time\nseems to have a restraining, reformative function in Xunzi, now\nacquires a crucial expressive function that strengthens and enhances\nmotivations that are congenial to morality. It is at this point that\nXunzi, however inadvertently, points toward a more complex and\npluralistic theory of human nature that becomes a more plausible\ntheory of moral development because it takes just enough from\nMencius\u2019s theory that there are natural inclinations that could\nform a positive basis for the love and development of virtue (Wong,\n1996a; 2015a; for a different view of how ritual works in\nXunzi\u2019s theory of moral development see Sung, 2015; 2017).\n\nMencius, of course, attributes a much more extensive set of positive\ntendencies such as natural compassion for the suffering of others that\ncan be shaped into virtues such as ren or humanity, and the\ndebate between Xunzi and Mencius is how much the development of virtue\nis set up by inborn affective and cognitive impulses and intuitions,\nand how much is shaped by cultural processes and the influence of\nnorms. This brings out another reason why Confucians were set up to\nproduce a rich moral psychology. They took emotions as a potentially\npositive base for virtue, a base that could be made receptive to the\ninsights of reflection and reasoning. Modern Western philosophy is\noften more inclined to see emotion as an impediment to morality, as in\nKant (except for the feeling of respect for the moral law) or as a\ncompetitor to reasoning and its potential master, as in Hume. Rarely\nis there an exploration of reasoning and emotion as partners that\ndevelop as they interact with each other (for a comparison see Wong,\n2015b, 2017). \n\nThe differences between Mencius\u2019 and Xunzi\u2019s theories are\nsubstantial and raise sophisticated philosophical issues that remain\nrelevant to this day. Xunzi launched a vigorous critique of\nMencius\u2019 claim for the existence of natural tendencies that form\nthe basis for development of a good person. In arguing against\nMencius, he presupposes a strict separation between that which is\ngiven in human nature and that which must be developed through\ndeliberate effort. Mencius\u2019 conception of human nature, on the\nother hand, presupposes that what is in human nature can be something\nthat can be further developed along tendencies that are given but need\nto be triggered by interaction through learning in the right\nenvironment. Their differing conceptions of human nature exemplify a\nvariability and ambiguity in conceptions of human nature that is a\nsubject of analysis for contemporary philosophers of science (see\nGriffiths, 2002; Wong, 2015a). Furthermore, Mencius and Xunzi differ\nin their theories as to whether ethical norms and values are\ndiscovered or invented, with Mencius\u2019 theory construing them as\npart of the order established by Heaven, and Xunzi\u2019s theory\nconstruing them as constructed by human beings to solve problems for\ncooperation arising from the self-seeking and competitiveness of human\nnature.\n\nOne debate that arises within the comparative perspective, however, is\nwhether the Confucians had anything that fits the Western notion of\nmorality. The words \u2019ethics\u2019 and \u2018ethical\u2019\nhave been used to in this piece to remain neutral on this matter. Some\ncontemporary thinkers (most prominently, Williams, 1985) have tended\nto confine the \u2018moral\u2019 to a relatively narrow set of\ncharacteristics associated with Kant\u2019s moral philosophy \u2013\na belief in universal laws validated by pure reason, a belief that\nresponsibility for one\u2019s actions requires a freedom from\ndetermination from external causes \u2013 and on this view of the\nmoral, it could be argued that there is no equivalent in Chinese\nphilosophy (see Rosemont, 1988). If such a contrast is made, then\nConfucians are acknowledged to have an ethics as opposed to a\nmorality, where an ethics does embrace questions about value, how one\nought to live one\u2019s life, and what the good life consists in.\nOne question to be debated here is whether Western notions of the\nmoral are so uniform and narrow as to conform to one\nphilosopher\u2019s (even a great one) specific conception of the\nmoral. On the criteria given by Williams, Hume wouldn\u2019t have a\nmorality, even though he used the term. It is true that a dominant\nstrain of modern Western morality makes use of a crucial distinction\nbetween a morally significant sphere of life that has to do primarily\nwith one\u2019s relationships with others and a \u201cprivate\u201d\nsphere of life in which one has moral \u201ctime-off\u201d that is\nno one\u2019s business but one\u2019s own. If this dominant strain\nis taken to define morality, then Confucians would have no morality.\nIt also would eliminate certain utilitarians from having a morality:\nthose who insist that there is no purely private sphere because any\ntype of action or omission could have substantial impact on others\ngiven the right circumstances.\n\nAnother potential contrast arises from the focus in modern Western\nmoralities on individual rights to liberty and to other goods, where\nthe basis for attributing such rights to persons lies in a moral worth\nattributed to each individual independently of what conduces to\nindividual\u2019s responsibilities to self and others. Confucianism\nlacks a comparable concept, given its assumption that the ethical life\nof responsibility to others and individual flourishing are\ninextricably intertwined (Shun, 2004). A frequent criticism from the\nWestern side is that Confucianism fails to provide adequate protection\nto those legitimate interests an individual has that may conflict with\ncommunity interests. On the other side, some advocates of Confucian\nethics criticize rights-focused moralities for ignoring the social\nnature of human beings and of portraying human life in an excessively\n\u201catomistic\u201d or \u201cindividualist\u201d conception of\npersons (e.g., Rosemont, 1986). Against those who argue that\nConfucianism does not protect the individual enough, it could be\nreplied that the Confucian framework of responsibilities to others can\nafford significant protections to the individual and arguably\naddresses the human need for community and belonging better than\nrights frameworks (Rosemont, 1991a, 2004). Another criticism from the\nWestern side is that the dignity of the individual cannot be honored\nwithout recognition of individual rights. It has been replied,\nhowever, that dignity can lie in one\u2019s human capacity to\nparticipate in the distinctively human life of relationship and in\nliving up to one\u2019s responsibilities to others (Ihara, 2004).\nMoreover, it is possible that rights in some sense can play a role in\nthe Confucian tradition, even if such rights are not grounded in the\nidea of the independent moral worth of the autonomous individual.\nWithin that tradition, rights may be seen as necessary for protecting\nindividuals\u2019 interests when the right relationships of care\nirretrievably break down (Chan, 1999). Rights in the sense of\njustified claims to be protected in one\u2019s speech even when\nprotest and dissenting against authority can be justified as conducive\nto the health of the community (Wong, 2004a). Mencius recognized a\nright to revolution against tyrannical kings (1B8); he furthermore\nadvised kings to attach more weight to the opinions of his people than\nto those of his ministers and officers in making certain crucial\ndecisions (1B7). Xunzi recognized the need for subordinates to speak\ntheir views freely to their superiors (Xunzi,\nZigong, Way of the Son). If we carry the reasoning\nin Mencius and Xunzi one step further, we see the need to protect a\nspace in which they may speak freely without fear of suppression, and\nhence a derive a right in the \u201cthin\u201d sense of what one has\nwhenever one has justifiable claims on others to assure one\u2019s\npossession of things or one\u2019s exercise of certain capacities.\n(This article focuses on rights in relation to classical Confucianism.\nFor a detailed discussion of rights discourse in seventeenth and\neighteenth century Confucianism, see Angle, 2002). On the other side,\none must be wary of oversimplifications of Western rights-oriented\nethical codes. The social nature of persons is not denied by all such\ncodes (of the major theories only Hobbes seems to take an\nunambiguously \u201catomistic\u201d view of human beings, and\nRousseau and Locke seem to require no such view).\n\nThe fact that there are developments of each tradition that bring each\ncloser to the other may suggest that each could learn from the other.\nEven if not all rights-oriented codes are \u201catomistic,\u201d an\nincreasing worry about Western culture as it has actually developed in\npractice is the prevalence of an individualism that Tocqueville\ndefined as a \u201ccalm and considered feeling which disposes each\ncitizen to isolate himself from the mass of his fellows and withdraw\ninto the circle of family and friends,\u201d such that \u201cwith\nthis little society formed to his taste he gladly leaves the greater\nsociety to look after itself.\u201d Such people, Tocqueville\nobserved, form \u201cthe habit of thinking of themselves in isolation\nand imagine that their whole destiny is in their hands.\u201d They\ncome to \u201cforget their ancestors\u201d and also their\ndescendants, as well as isolating themselves from their\ncontemporaries. \u201cEach man is forever thrown back on himself\nalone, and there is danger that he may be shut up in the solitude of\nhis own heart\u201d (1969, pp. 506, 508). Those impressed with this\nworry and connect it with gross inequality in the most affluent nation\nin the world would do well to look to a tradition that appreciates the\nway we thrive or falter within specific communities that nurture or\nshut us out. Or consider an intriguing argument by Bell (2008, pp.\n43\u201355) that in contemporary East Asian societies the importance\nplaced on social hierarchy provides an outlet for the rich and\npowerful members of these societies to distinguish themselves, whereas\nin socially egalitarian societies such as the U.S., the primary outlet\nis through the accumulation of wealth, and hence the relative economic\nequality of East Asian societies as compared to Western societies such\nas the U.S. On the other side, a tradition that has tended to value\nthe idea of social harmony at the cost of sufficiently protecting\ndissenters who desire to point out abuses of power or just plain bad\nthinking by authorities would do well to look at another tradition\nthat does not value social harmony as highly but has endured and is\nvigorous.\n\nThese arguments for greater compatibility between Chinese and Western\nethics do not eliminate all significant differences between them on\nthe subject of rights. It is possible to argue that even if\nresponsibility-frameworks are developed and institutionalized to\nprovide genuine protection to dissenting individuals, they cannot\nprovide as much protection as rights frameworks when individual\ninterests seriously threaten communal or social interests. And if\nWestern ethics sometimes provides more protection to the individual\nagainst communal or social interests, this could be seen as\nunacceptable from a Confucian standpoint. One possible stance on these\nkinds of differences is evaluational incommensurability. The stance is\nthat each tradition is not wrong to emphasize different values, that\nno judgment of superiority can be made here. The argument for this may\nstart with the claim that each sort of ethic focuses on a good that\nmay reasonably occupy the center of an ethical ideal for human life.\nOn the one hand, there is the good of belonging to and contributing to\na community; on the other, there is the good of respect for the\nindividual apart from any potential contribution to community. It\nwould be surprising, the argument goes, if there were just one\njustifiable way of setting a priority with respect to the two goods,\neven when we take into account the justifiable ways in which the two\nkinds of ethics could be brought closer together. On this view,\ncomparative ethics teaches us about the diversity and richness of what\nhuman beings may reasonably prize, and about the impossibility of\nreconciling all they prize in just a single ethical ideal (e.g., Wong,\n1984, 1996).\n\nDaoist ethics are often cited as exemplars of substantial difference\nwith the Western tradition. Both the Zhuangzi\u2019s and\nDaodejing\u2019s commendation of wuwei is a case in\npoint. It is a commendation of a style of action that consists in\nbeing receptive rather than aggressive, following from behind rather\nthan leading in front, accommodating rather than confrontational, and\nbeing flexible and ready to change with the situation rather than\nrigid and operating from general predetermined principles. While the\ntheme of attunement with the world is present at the roots of Western\ntraditions, no major ethic in the West gives the ideal of spontaneous,\neffortless attunement the kind of centrality Daoism gives to it, and\nindeed, Slingerland (2003) argues that the ideal of spontaneous and\neffortless action that is in accord with the normative order of the\ncosmos is quite important to the early Confucian thinkers. Ames (1994)\ntraces the wu-wei ideal as it is applied to rulership in\nConfucianism, Daoism, and Legalism.\n\nAnother case for substantial difference with the Western tradition\nrests on the strong skepticism in Daoist ethics about the benefits of\nconceptualized distinctions between good and bad, right and wrong. Yet\nthese ethics make recommendations that add up to putting forward a way\nof life. In the Zhuangzi, that way of life involves not\ntaking taking oneself and one\u2019s ideas so seriously. Chapter two\ncontains a story of monkeys who were furious with their keeper when he\nannounced the policy of three nuts every morning and four in the\nevening. The keeper then announced a change: \u201cfour nuts in the\nmorning and three in the evening,\u201d this time to the great\ndelight of the monkeys. Kupperman (1999) suggests that we are invited\nto view our own urgent concerns in the humorous light of the\nmonkeys\u2019 concern about the difference between the two policies.\nAt the same time we are invited to question our own judgment of the\nmonkeys. Why think the monkeys are silly if our urgent concerns might\nlook to some other kind of creature the way the monkeys\u2019\nconcerns look to us? The way of life recommended in the\nZhuangzi, then, includes openness to what might escape our\ncurrent conceptualizations and preconceptions. We are invited to see\nthat our conceptualizations of the world are inevitably incomplete and\ndistorting. We attempt to order the world by sorting its features\nunder pairs of opposites, but opposites in the real world never match\nup neatly with our conceptual opposites. Real \u201copposites\u201d\nescape our attempts to cleanly separate them. Despite our best\nefforts, they switch places in our conceptual maps, blur, and merge\ninto one another. That is why chapter two of the Zhuangzi\nsays that the sage recognizes a \u201cthis,\u201d but a\n\u201cthis\u201d which is also \u201cthat,\u201d a\n\u201cthat\u201d which is also \u201cthis.\u201dThe appropriate\nresponse to the inadequacies of our conceptual structures is to remain\nopen to what those structures distort or hide. In chapter five, men\nwho have had their feet amputated as criminal punishment are scorned\nby society, but not by their Daoist masters, who see what is of\nworth in them. In chapter one, Zhuangzi chastises his friend\nHuizi for failing to see beyond the ordinary, humdrum uses of some\nlarge gourds. Huizi tried using one of the gourds for a water\ncontainer, but it was so heavy he couldn\u2019t lift it. He then\ntried to make dippers from them, but they were too large and unwieldy.\nHe deemed the gourds of no use and smashed them to pieces. Zhuangzi\nasks why he didn\u2019t think of making the gourd into a great tub so\nhe could go floating around the rivers and lakes, instead of worrying\nbecause it was too big and unwieldy to dip into things!\n\u201cObviously you still have a lot of underbrush in your\nhead!\u201d concluded Zhuangzi. He does not deny that the more\nordinary uses are genuine uses for the gourds, and indeed, they are.\nRather, Zhuangzi\u2019s point is to clear the underbrush from our\nheads and to get an enlarged view of what is of value. Much\nof the value of Daoist ethics lies in its warnings against the\nconstricting effects of conventional ethical codes, the blinkering of\nvision that comes with what we might otherwise regard as admirable\nintegrity and dedication. The other side of this warning is an\nintriguing positive: that there is a way we can pay attention to the\nworld that allows us to \u201csee around\u201d our blinkering\nconceptualizations, to see what is of value that we have missed, to\nmove with the grain of things. One of the central interpretive\nproblems concerning the Zhuangzi in particular is how to\nreconcile the skeptical themes about the limits of our concepts and\ntheories with the recommendations for living in a certain way, since\nthe recommendations are framed with concepts (see Kjellberg and\nIvanhoe, 1996, Hansen, 2003, and Wong, 2005 for a variety of\ninterpretations).\n\nIt is not easy to find an analogue to someone such as Zhuangzi in the\nWestern tradition. There are some important parallels in the\nHellenistic Stoics and Epicureans to certain themes in Zhuangzi. They,\nlike him, emphasized the need to accept the inevitable in human life,\nthe need to dampen one\u2019s desires to achieve tranquility in the\nface of the inevitable, and to identify with the world that makes\nacceptance and dampening of desires possible (Nussbaum, 1994). On the\nother hand, there is contrast in the Stoic belief in logos as\nthe basis of order in the universe. There are parallels to some\nZhuangist themes in Nietzsche: the skepticism about the adequacy of\nour conceptualizations of the world and of value; the warnings against\nconventional moralities as constricting, and the awareness of how the\napplication of ethical judgment to others can be a means of asserting\npower over them (The Genealogy of Morals). However,\nZhuangzi\u2019s vision possesses a generosity and inclusiveness, an\nembrace of the lowly and cast-off, that seems anathema to\nNietzsche\u2019s celebration of the \u00fcbermensch and his project\nof fashioning himself like a work of art. Nietzsche proposes strong,\nvital desire at the heart of this aesthetic project, rather than the\ndampening of desire. He represents a kind of radical individualism\nthat did not find a congenial home in the Chinese tradition (Solomon,\n1995).\n\nIn Buddhism, especially Chan Buddhism, there also is rejection of\nconventional ethical values as blinkering and distorting (see Hui\nNeng, Liuxu tanjing, and The Recorded Conversations\nof I-Hs\u00fcan), and also a sense that one can become\nattuned to the world so as to move with its grain. This is not\nsurprising since Buddhism was profoundly influenced by Daoism upon its\nimportation into China. However, Buddhism may have especially\nchallenging implications for Western ethics in its special emphasis on\nthe elimination of suffering and on the way it explains suffering by\nreferring to the human attachment to self as fixed ego entity. As\nnoted above in discussing Parfit\u2019s connection to the Buddhist\nview of the self, realization that the self is not a bounded and\ndiscrete entity may encourage a much more impersonal view of oneself\nand one\u2019s projects and desires. One\u2019s concern widens to\nall of life, and one dampens one\u2019s desires so as to lessen\nattachment to the self\u2019s cares and concerns. Some may find this\nan unacceptably demanding ethic. It may seem to drain all passion from\nlife, and it requires that we dampen the attachment we have not only\nto our selves but also to special others. This negative reaction may\nfit with Kupperman\u2019s (1999) characterization of much Western\nethics as upholding only a limited altruism that allows one a private\nsphere of life free from moral demands and in which one gives much\nmore weight to the cares and concerns of the self and those close to\nthe self. However, as the above comparison with Parfit suggests, there\nare themes in Western philosophy that parallel the kind of impersonal\naltruism urged upon us by Buddhism. Some utilitarians have strongly\nheld to the theme that each counts for one in calculating what\nproduces the greatest good, and they have derived challenging\nconsequences from that theme for the question of what one should be\nprepared to give to alleviate the suffering of strangers (see Singer,\n1972, and Unger, 1996), arguing that the way many in affluent nations\nindulge themselves and their own is simply insupportable in a world of\nwidespread and severe suffering. Some have seen the sort of impersonal\nconcern that utilitarianism may demand as an indication that it\nunsuitable for human beings, who are so strongly partial to themselves\nand their own (see Williams, 1981 and Wolf, 1982). Buddhism presses\nfor the possibility that impersonal concern is humanly possible, and\nthe fact that it is a vibrant and long-lived tradition with many\ncommitted practitioners provides some support for the viability of\nimpersonal concern as a ideal that is capable of claiming allegiance\nand influencing how people try to live their lives (see Flanagan, 2013\nfor a reference to Buddhism in support of the viability of such an\nideal .\n",
