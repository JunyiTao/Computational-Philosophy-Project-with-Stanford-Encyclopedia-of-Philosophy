    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Measurement || Standardization and scientific progress\n8.1 Standardization and scientific progress\n\nA topic that has attracted considerable philosophical attention in\nrecent years is the selection and improvement of measurement\nstandards. Generally speaking, to standardize a quantity concept is to\nprescribe a determinate way in which that concept is to be applied to\nconcrete\n particulars.[21]\n To standardize a measuring instrument is to assess how well the\noutcomes of measuring with that instrument fit the prescribed mode of\napplication of the relevant concept.\n [22]\n The term \u201cmeasurement standard\u201d accordingly has at least\ntwo meanings: on the one hand, it is commonly used to refer to\nabstract rules and definitions that regulate the use of quantity\nconcepts, such as the definition of the meter. On the other hand, the\nterm \u201cmeasurement standard\u201d is also commonly used to refer\nto the concrete artifacts and procedures that are deemed exemplary of\nthe application of a quantity concept, such as the metallic bar that\nserved as the standard meter until 1960. This duality in meaning\nreflects the dual nature of standardization, which involves both\nabstract and concrete aspects.\n\nIn\n Section 4\n it was noted that standardization involves choices among nontrivial\nalternatives, such as the choice among different thermometric fluids\nor among different ways of marking equal duration. These choices are\nnontrivial in the sense that they affect whether or not the same\ntemperature (or time) intervals are deemed equal, and hence affect\nwhether or not statements of natural law containing the term\n\u201ctemperature\u201d (or \u201ctime\u201d) come out true.\nAppealing to theory to decide which standard is more accurate would be\ncircular, since the theory cannot be determinately applied to\nparticulars prior to a choice of measurement standard. This\ncircularity has been variously called the \u201cproblem of\ncoordination\u201d (van Fraassen 2008: Ch. 5) and the \u201cproblem\nof nomic measurement\u201d (Chang 2004: Ch. 2). As already mentioned,\nconventionalists attempted to escape the circularity by positing a\npriori statements, known as \u201ccoordinative\ndefinitions\u201d, which were supposed to link quantity-terms with\nspecific measurement operations. A drawback of this solution is that\nit supposes that choices of measurement standard are arbitrary and\nstatic, whereas in actual practice measurement standards tend to be\nchosen based on empirical considerations and are eventually improved\nor replaced with standards that are deemed more accurate.\n\nA new strand of writing on the problem of coordination has emerged in\nrecent years, consisting most notably of the works of Hasok Chang\n(2001, 2004, 2007; Barwich and Chang 2015) and Bas van Fraassen (2008:\nCh. 5; 2009, 2012; see also Padovani 2015, 2017; Michel 2019). These\nworks take a historical and coherentist approach to the problem.\nRather than attempting to avoid the problem of circularity completely,\nas their predecessors did, they set out to show that the circularity\nis not vicious. Chang argues that constructing a quantity-concept and\nstandardizing its measurement are co-dependent and iterative tasks.\nEach \u201cepistemic iteration\u201d in the history of\nstandardization respects existing traditions while at the same time\ncorrecting them (Chang 2004: Ch. 5). The pre-scientific concept of\ntemperature, for example, was associated with crude and ambiguous\nmethods of ordering objects from hot to cold. Thermoscopes, and\neventually thermometers, helped modify the original concept and made\nit more precise. With each such iteration the quantity concept was\nre-coordinated to a more stable set of standards, which in turn\nallowed theoretical predictions to be tested more precisely,\nfacilitating the subsequent development of theory and the construction\nof more stable standards, and so on.\n\nHow this process avoids vicious circularity becomes clear when we look\nat it either \u201cfrom above\u201d, i.e., in retrospect given our\ncurrent scientific knowledge, or \u201cfrom within\u201d, by looking\nat historical developments in their original context (van Fraassen\n2008: 122). From either vantage point, coordination succeeds because\nit increases coherence among elements of theory and instrumentation.\nThe questions \u201cwhat counts as a measurement of quantity\nX?\u201d and \u201cwhat is quantity X?\u201d,\nthough unanswerable independently of each other, are addressed\ntogether in a process of mutual refinement. It is only when one adopts\na foundationalist view and attempts to find a starting point for\ncoordination free of presupposition that this historical process\nerroneously appears to lack epistemic justification (2008: 137).\n\nThe new literature on coordination shifts the emphasis of the\ndiscussion from the definitions of quantity-terms to the\nrealizations of those definitions. In metrological jargon, a\n\u201crealization\u201d is a physical instrument or procedure that\napproximately satisfies a given definition (cf. JCGM 2012: 5.1).\nExamples of metrological realizations are the official prototypes of\nthe kilogram and the cesium fountain clocks used to standardize the\nsecond. Recent studies suggest that the methods used to design,\nmaintain and compare realizations have a direct bearing on the\npractical application of concepts of quantity, unit and scale, no less\nthan the definitions of those concepts (Riordan 2015; Tal 2016). The\nrelationship between the definition and realizations of a unit becomes\nespecially complex when the definition is stated in theoretical terms.\nSeveral of the base units of the International System (SI) \u2014\nincluding the meter, kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole \u2014 are no\nlonger defined by reference to any specific kind of physical system,\nbut by fixing the numerical value of a fundamental physical constant.\nThe kilogram, for example, was redefined in 2019 as the unit of mass\nsuch that the numerical value of the Planck constant is exactly\n6.62607015 \u00d7 10-34 kg m2 s-1\n(BIPM 2019:131). Realizing the kilogram under this definition is a\nhighly theory-laden task. The study of the practical realization of\nsuch units has shed new light on the evolving relationships between\nmeasurement and theory (Tal 2018; de Courtenay et al 2019; Wolff\n2020b).\n",
