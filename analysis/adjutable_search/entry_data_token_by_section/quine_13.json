    "main_text": "Metaphysics Naturalized\n5. Metaphysics Naturalized\n\nQuine takes seriously the idea that \u201cit is within science\nitself, and not in some prior philosophy, that reality is to be\nidentified and described\u201d (1981, 21). It follows from this idea,\nas he construes it, that our best scientific theory of the world tells\nus as much as we know about reality. (Our best theory at given time\ntells us as much as we know at that time; no doubt our views will\nprogress.) So setting out the broad outlines of that theory is the\nQuinean version or analogue of metaphysics, though he does not much\nuse the word. This subject interacts with that of the last section:\nQuine\u2019s account of the world both lays down the constraints\nwithin which an account of knowledge must proceed, and is, in outline,\nthe knowledge that must be accounted for.\n",
