    "main_text": "Background\n1. Background\n\nMuch of the most prominent philosophy in the Han period in China was\nclosely associated with the state. Philosophical discussions and texts\nwere commissioned by state or imperial representatives and\norganizations, to help resolve problems or guide political action. By\nthe Han, there had long been a tradition of philosophy associated with\nadvisors to the state. Many of the most well-known philosophers in\nearlier periods had been political advisors, with some notable\nexceptions such as the \u201cDao-tradition\u201d figures represented\nin texts such as the late Warring States Period (475\u2013221 BCE)\ntext Zhuangzi. While prior to the Han, we find a variety of\nphilosophical \u201cschools\u201d associated with different states\nand individuals (as there was no imperial structure), many (but not\nall) of the surviving philosophical texts from the Han are associated\nin some way with the Han state. Some well-known examples of philosophy\nclosely linked to Han imperial concerns and issues are the treatises\nof the early Han advisors Lu Jia (240\u2013170 BCE) and Jia Yi\n(200\u2013169 BCE), the Huainanzi, commissioned by Liu An\n(179\u2013122 BCE), the vassal ruler of the Huainan state and uncle\nof Emperor Wu of Han (156\u201387 BCE), the Yantielun\n(\u201cSalt and Iron Discourses\u201d), the account by Huan Kuan of\na series of discussions organized by Emperor Zhao of Han concerning\nstate production of goods, and the Baihutong, recounting a\nsimilar group of imperially sanctioned discussions. It is not quite\nright, however, to say that in the Han, philosophy becomes the purview\nof the state. Religion, divination, medicine, and other areas of\nthought all contained a great deal of philosophical content. And as we\nwill see, philosophical discussions in the later part of the Han were\nincreasingly independent of the state.\n\nIn the Han we also find the origins of the commentarial tradition on\nphilosophical texts. There was already an established commentarial\ntradition by the time of the Han on the historical and ritual texts\nknown as the Five Classics. The commentarial tradition on the\nancient historical text Chunqiu, in particular, became\ncentral in the early Han. A new commentarial tradition developed in\nthe Han, however, connected to philosophical texts such as the\nAnalects, Daodejing, Zhuangzi, and others.\nThe commentarial tradition surrounding these texts became a major\nsource of philosophical development throughout the rest of the history\nof philosophy in China (see Makeham 2003).\n\nAn additional important feature of Han philosophy is what we might\ncall the \u201cnaturalistic shift\u201d. Scientific developments in\nthe Han, particularly in astronomy and medicine, linked philosophical\nconcerns to those of areas that were newly developing at the time and\nmore empirical in nature (see entries on\n Chinese philosophy and Chinese medicine\n and on\n science and Chinese philosophy).\n",
