He has far less to say about this than\ndeduction, doing little more than characterize it as \u201cargument\nfrom the particular to the universal\u201d. However, induction (or\nsomething very much like it) plays a crucial role in the theory of\nscientific knowledge in the Posterior Analytics: it is\ninduction, or at any rate a cognitive process that moves from\nparticulars to their generalizations, that is the basis of knowledge\nof the indemonstrable first principles of sciences.\n",
