    "main_text": "Varieties of Civic Humanism || Coluccio Salutati and Aurelio Lippo Brandolini\n3.2 Coluccio Salutati and Aurelio Lippo Brandolini\n\nYet the fundamental premises of Renaissance civic humanism do not\nnecessarily entail republicanism. Many of the cities of\nfifteenth-century Italy were in fact governed by individuals who were\nself-styled princes or by oligarchic dynasties. As Quentin Skinner\nobserved many years ago (1978: 118\u2013128), humanists were not\nadverse to modification of the virtues associated with civic\ngovernment to suit conditions of a princely regime (see also Skinner\n2002: 118\u2013159). Baron sought to excuse or dismiss such ideas,\nbut his arguments have been challenged.\n\nOne of the most notable figures to take up this agenda was Coluccio\nSalutati (1331\u20131406) in a treatise entitled De tyranno\n(On Tyranny; 1400 [1927]. Salutati had been not only\nBruni\u2019s instructor but also his immediate predecessor as\nChancellor of the Florentine republic. In the view of Salutati, there\nare valid reasons that one should stand prepared to countenance\ntyrannical rulers at times. In support of what might seem at first\nglance an odd position for a humanist to embrace, he introduces a\ndistinction between two types of tyrants: those who rule without valid\ntitle (usurpers) and those who possess a legitimate claim to office\nbut use their powers unlawfully and unjustly as a result of their\nprideful characters. This difference is decisive for Salutati, whose\nmain concern is with the propriety of slaying tyrants in general and\nwith the murder of Julius Caesar in particular.\n\nAccording to Salutati, the appropriate treatment of a tyrant is wholly\ndependent upon whether or not he is a usurper. If so, then those\nsubject to him may invoke the Roman law principle that it is\n\u201clawful to repel by force the assailant of an individual or a\npiece of property and if he persists, to kill him\u201d in order to\njustify resistance to a tyrant (1927: 86). By contrast, Salutati\ncondemns those who argue that wicked princes ought to be killed even\nwhen they hold their office by right. He asserts that only the public\nauthority that placed a ruler in office (whether a superior or the\ncommunity) enjoys the right to remove him from power; private persons,\nacting in their own right, have no say in the matter.\n\nSalutati rounds off his treatise by applying his argument to the case\nof Caesar. He purports to prove (in a highly polemical refutation of\nCicero) that Caesar was not a usurper, but instead held legitimate\noffice authorized by the Roman people. Indeed, Salutati maintains that\nif Caesar seemed to behave tyrannically, it was because the tumultuous\ncondition of the times called for such conduct. Caesar is to be\npraised as the savior of Rome, not condemned as a tyrant.\nConsequently, it was entirely wrong for private citizens to slay\nCaesar, since he had not usurped public power. Moreover, to the extent\nthat he was serving the common good, the Romans as a people had no\nlegitimate warrant to remove him from office. Salutati thus\napproaches, if he does not explicitly endorse, a conception of\nbenevolent despotism that challenges the usual bases for\ndistinguishing between king and tyrant.\n\nAnother Florentine humanist\u2014albeit it not of the stature of\nBruni and Salutati\u2014went still further in praising monarchy.\nAurelio Lippo Brandolini (c.1454\u20131497) in his De\ncomparatione reipublicae et regni (On the Comparison of\nRepublic and Kingdoms; c. 1490) defends kingship against the\ncharge made by his fellow Italians (especially, Florentines) that it\nwas inferior to republican government. Writing at the court of the\nHungarian King Mattias, whose patronage he briefly enjoyed, Brandolini\nconstructed a dialogue between a Florentine merchant, Domenico, and\nthe king himself, in which every conventional rationale for the\nsuperiority of republics to other constitutional systems, especially\nmonarchies, is proposed and examined, only to be decimated. Regardless\nof whether or not Brandolini wrote De comparatione merely as\npiece of flattery for King Mattias, his arguments for kingship still\nwarrant serious attention.\n\nIn the first two books of the dialogue, Domenico\u2019s case in favor\nof the superiority of republican constitutions is demolished by\nMattias. This is hardly what might be expected of a civic humanist, at\nleast if one regards Bruni as the paradigmatic instance thereof. But\nBrandolini manages to use precisely the tools of his humanist training\nto dismiss the main values that led humanists to praise the Florentine\nrepublican constitution. Of more immediate interest, at the beginning\nof the third and final book of De comparatione, the\ndiscussion turns to the examination and defense of the proposition\nthat the governance of one person is best. Initially, this position is\nsupported by means of a set of analogies to the helmsman, the military\ncommander, and the head of the household. Thereafter, the debate\nconcentrates on how the rule of a single excellent man constitutes a\nsafeguard against the real possibility of destructive factionalism\nthat flows from governance by the many.\n\nBy way of proof, Mattias narrates a notably revisionist account of\nRoman history, according to which the early kings successfully\npreserved peace and concord. Their replacement by consuls led\nnaturally and inescapably to the decline of the city over time into a\nseries of civil wars in which various men contended for power. In the\nsame passage, Mattias indicates that Lorenzo de\u2019Medici in\nFlorence achieved the same effect as did the Roman monarchs, namely,\neliminating from the city the tumults caused by factionalism. A\nsingle, defining political will yields unity. Brandolini thereby\nadopts a position precisely opposed to Bruni, who, as has been seen,\nclaimed that the Florentine republican constitution was the source of\nharmonization among the classes. Brandolini and Bruni focus on\nprecisely the same problem\u2014how to curb faction leading to class\nconflict\u2014but they arrive at radically different conclusions.\nArguably, nothing about Bruni\u2019s position is inherently more\nexemplary of civic humanist than Brandolini\u2019s.\n3.3. Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini\n\nIt would be difficult to find anyone during the fifteenth century\nbetter qualified than Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (1405\u20131464) to\nclaim the mantle of civic humanism. As was the case with the authors\nalready discussed he was steeped in the studia humanitas from\na fine Florentine education. An almost exact contemporary of the great\nhumanists Palmieri, Valla and Patrizi, he enjoyed a sterling\nreputation for his writings; his letters, in particular, compare\nfavorably in their style as well as their substance with the best of\nhumanist literature. He held positions in the imperial court as a\nsecretary and diplomat, and eventually worked his way up the ladder of\necclesiastical preferment to be elevated to the papal see as Pius\nII\u2014often called the first \u201chumanist pope\u201d. Yet, in\nhis most famous work of political thought, De ortu et auctoritate\nimperii Romani (On the Origin and Authority of the Roman\nEmpire; 1446), Piccolomini advanced a defense of a universalist,\nimperial and even absolutist ideal of government under the banner of\nthe Holy Roman Empire. As with many of the authors previously\nsurveyed, such a position would seem wholly incompatible with civic\nhumanism.\n\nPiccolomini\u2019s argument starts, but does not finish, with\nkingship. Kings were first authorized in the earliest times of human\nhistory in order to shield the rights of weaker men from injury by the\nstronger. This is a theme common to numerous republican civic\nhumanists, drawn from a position held by Cicero, who was an important\nsource for them. The king is regarded as the personification of\njustice. His moral character outshines that of his fellows, so he does\nnot require law as the foundation of his rule, since his judgments are\nso rooted in a sense of justice and equity that they enjoy the force\nof law. A conventional account of the breakdown of kingship would\ninvolve the declining morality of successive kings, leading to\ntyranny. By contrast, Piccolomini detects a quite different inherent\nweakness in political arrangements associated with kingship,\nregardless of the moral qualities of a particular royal incumbent.\n\nIn De ortu, he points out that the creation of a king was not\na unique or isolated event. Rather, throughout the world there are\nmany kings who rule over a plurality of territories. As these kingdoms\ndefined and expanded their geographical boundaries or spheres of\njurisdiction, they inevitably came into conflict. And since there was\nno means of arbitration amongst such coequal powers, the resolution of\ndisputes between them occurred by means of armed engagements. These\nensuing conflicts between royal powers and their peoples are directly\nthe function of an inescapable structural limitation endemic to\nlocalized or regional kingship per se. It is not morally\ncorrupt rulers alone who are held responsible for clashes over lands\nand rights. Instead, any king who is performing his duties properly\nwill, Piccolomini supposes, inevitably enter into contention with\nanother king and will be compelled to turn to warfare.\n\nConsequently, the political model of an independent network of\nkingships is incompatible with the very purpose which warranted the\ncreation of kings, namely, the maintenance of just and harmonious\nrelations among human beings. The decentralized distribution of royal\npower ultimately produces an effect which is exactly contrary to that\nintended. Empowered as the agent of social harmony, kingship proves to\nbe its enemy, confounding rather than reinforcing the justice which\nthe ruler is charged with upholding. Notice here how the problems of\nconflict and the absence of harmony, addressed by many civic\nhumanists, manifest themselves in Piccolomini\u2019s thought as well.\nHis solution, however, is quite different from his Florentine\ncolleagues. Since the particularity of royal regimes runs afoul of the\nordained end of political power, the attainment of justice, and the\norder that comes with it, can only be achieved by a universality of\npolitical rule, that is, a single world empire. In imperial government\nalone does political power finally attain a form consistent with the\naim of its original authorization. Once again, one may plausibly\nassert that civic humanist principles might move in a direction quite\ndivergent from republicanism (Lee 2018).\n3.4 Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli\n\nMachiavelli (1469\u20131527) is doubtless the best known of all the\nauthors discussed here on account of his Il principe\n(Prince; c. 1513\u20131514) and (to a lesser extent)\nDiscorsi (Discourses; c. 1514\u20131519). The\nformer is a somewhat notorious advice-book for rulers who wish to gain\nand hold power; the latter evaluates the strengths of a republican\nsystem of government. Machiavelli was deeply involved in governing the\nrepublic of Florence, serving in several important official\ncapacities, until a 1512 coup against the regime engineered by the\nMedici family cost him his position. Less often recognized is that he\nwrote prolifically\u2014poetry, plays, histories, military\nmanuals\u2014and left us with a large collection of correspondence\nand dispatches from his diplomatic activities (Nederman 2023).\nScholars from many viewpoints, judge Machiavelli to be the epitome of\ncivic humanist republicanism during the later Italian Renaissance\n(Najemy 1996). The academic literature on Machiavelli\u2019s thought\nis immense. Any serious attempt to summarize it is a fool\u2019s\nerrand.\n\nStated simply, Machiavelli encapsulates the multiple forms of civic\nhumanism that have been examined. On the one hand, the\nDiscorsi is said to epitomize the republican ideals of\nself-governance and active citizenship commonly associated with the\nessence of civic humanism. (As mentioned in the Introduction,\nMachiavelli is one of the primary historical figures to whom\ncontemporary republican philosophers look for ideas and inspiration.)\nOn the other hand, Il principe exemplifies the tendency of\nsome civic humanists who have been considered above to look toward\nmonarchic regimes as the preferable form of rule. A plethora of\nscholarly effort has been directed toward attempting to reconcile\nthese two evidently very contradictory positions. Some interpreters\nsuggest, for instance, that the Discorsi represents his\n\u201creal\u201d views, and that Il principe is a satire or\nan attempt to win back his job in the Florentine government or to\nreveal to his fellow citizens the \u201creal\u201d inner workings of\nprincely regimes. Others propose that Il principe reflects\nMachiavelli\u2019s true teachings and that the principles ascribed to\nthe Discorsi are little more than extensions of his earlier\ntract. And some simply assert that no accord is possible.\n\nIt should be obvious, then, that the characteristics of the civic\nhumanist propensities ascribed by scholars to Machiavelli may be\nunderstood in a vast number of ways. Given the diversity of\ninterpretations, it is perhaps of greater utility to identify a single\ncentral theme shared by Il principe and the Discorsi\nand various civic humanists already discussed. Specifically,\nMachiavelli, like prior Florentine humanists, confronted in his\nwritings the quarrels that arose from conflicts between contending\nsets of interests, whether classes or political entities. All of the\nauthors previously addressed praised their favored form of government\n(republic, monarchy, empire) on the grounds that it introduced harmony\nand peace between clashing groups.\n\nIn both of his works, Machiavelli acknowledges the existence within\nevery community of two inherently incompatible classes: the\ngrandi (nobles) and the popolo (masses). The nobles\nseek to dominate those beneath them; the masses desire only to be free\nfrom domination. He clearly believes that these two parties can never\nbe brought together in a peaceful fashion. Their interests are simply\nincommensurable. So, Machiavelli\u2019s dilemma is how to avoid the\nnobles and the masses from warring against one another. He provides\ntwo possibilities. In Il principe, he remarks that a prince\nwho wishes to maintain his power must curb the aspirations of the\nnobility, to the extent that a ruler may reasonably consider\ncold-blooded murder as one of his tools. The people, by contrast,\nshould be treated mildly. Indeed, Machiavelli insists that if a prince\nmust choose to side with one or the other class, he should always take\nup the cause of the masses. Why? First, because their numbers are so\nmuch greater than those of the nobles that they are bound to prevail.\nSecond, because the popolo are so distant from the machinery\nof government headed by the prince that they are unable to observe the\nsometimes vicious means by which he must rule. Third, because they,\nbeing uneducated, are easily led by appearances and are unable to\napprehend the truth that the prince seeks to conceal.\n\nThe Discorsi treats class conflict in an entirely different\nway, namely, as a positive or productive feature of a well-developed\nrepublican system. Machiavelli\u2019s epitome of an ideal republic is\nancient Rome, in which tumult was rife. According to him, by\npermitting rather than suppressing the collision between these two\nsets of interests, Rome succeeded in actualizing and maintaining the\nparamount value of liberty. In a republic of the Roman sort, the\nnobility (via the Senate) has the main responsibility for governing,\nbut the people check that power by means of countervailing offices\n(such as the tribunes) and popular dissent. The struggle between them\nactually generates the liberty of the whole, both in terms of\nself-government unbeholden to either external forces or to tyranny and\nby assuring that the people\u2019s desire not to be dominated is\nachieved.\n\nMachiavelli recognizes that he is adopting an unusual perspective,\nsince customarily the blame for the collapse of the Roman Republic has\nbeen assigned to warring factions that eventually ripped it apart. By\ncontrast, he insists that precisely those conflicts generated a\n\u201ccreative tension\u201d that was the source of Roman liberty.\nOther republican models (such as those adopted by Sparta or Venice)\nproduced weaker political systems, ones that are either stagnant or\nprone to decay when circumstances change. The ultimate sign of the\nunique greatness of the Roman Republic is its conquest of huge amounts\nof territory, as a result of the grandi and the\npopolo setting aside their ultimately interminable struggles\n(at least for a time) in order to cooperate in the subjugation and\nexploitation of vast lands. Class struggle is thus socialized and put\nto effective use. It has been suggested, and with good reason, that a\nsignal element of Machiavelli\u2019s political project was to promote\nFlorence as the new Rome that will impose its domination over the rest\nof Italy. It is perhaps not too great a stretch to call him a civic\nhumanist with imperialistic pretensions (H\u00f6rnqvist 2004).\n4. The Pre-history of Civic Humanism\n\nAs previously noted, Baron posited that the birth of civic humanism\noccurred precisely out of the 1402 crisis in Florence. This position\nhas been challenged on various historical grounds, most notably by\nSeigel (1966). One problem with Baron\u2019s claim stems from his\nevident lack of familiarity with the political philosophy of preceding\ncenturies. Long before the beginning of the quattrocento,\npolitical authors (some of Florentine origin) had undertaken the\ndefense of the republican system of government generally and of the\nRoman Republic in particular in terms redolent of civic humanism.\nWriting c. 1265, a Florentine civil servant exiled to France, Brunetto\nLatini (1993), argued for the superiority of republics (communes) over\nother types of constitution and also described in detail the\nmechanisms of republican governance. Around 1300, another Italian, the\nParis-educated scholastic philosopher Ptolemy of Lucca (1997),\ncomposed an extensive brief favoring the Roman Republic as the ideal\nform of government (Blythe 2009; but see also Yun 2008 and Nederman\nand Sullivan 2012). The size of the list of pro-republican political\ntheorists writing before 1402 could be multiplied many times over.\n\nWhy was Baron inattentive to pre-Renaissance European republicanism?\nThe answer may be traced to what civic humanism represented to him:\nmodernity, secularity, rationality; in sum, the \u201cglory\u201d of\nthe Renaissance in contrast with the benighted Middle Ages. Scholars\nhave long since realized that a dividing line drawn between medieval\nand early modern periods is wholly unwarranted (Nederman 2009). Just\nas civic humanism as the designation of an intellectual movement\nwithin the tradition of Western political theory proves to be quite\ncapacious, so its existence and development should be regarded as more\nfluid historically than has often been claimed.",
