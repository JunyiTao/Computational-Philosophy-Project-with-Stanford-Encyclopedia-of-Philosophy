    "main_text": "Central Research Questions || Cognitive diversity\n2.3 Cognitive diversity\n\nA diversity of cognitive features of individuals can be beneficial in\nvarious problem-solving situations, including business and\npolicy-making (Page 2017). But how does the diversity of cognitive\nfeatures of scientists, including their background beliefs, reasoning\nstyles, research preferences, heuristics and strategies impact the\ninquiry of the scientific community? In philosophy of science, this\nissue gained traction with Kuhn\u2019s distinction between normal and\nrevolutionary science (Kuhn 1962), suggesting that different\npropensities may push scientists towards one type of research rather\nthan another (see also Hull 1988). This raises the question: how does\nthe distribution of risk-seeking, maverick scientists and risk-averse\nones impact the inquiry of the community? Put more generally: do some\nways of dividing labor across different research heuristics result in\na more successful collective inquiry than others?\n\nBy equipping agents with different cognitive features we can use ABMs\nto represent different cognitively diverse (or uniform) populations,\nand to study their impact on some measure of success of the communal\ninquiry. We will look at the models studying these issues in\n Section 4.3.\n",
