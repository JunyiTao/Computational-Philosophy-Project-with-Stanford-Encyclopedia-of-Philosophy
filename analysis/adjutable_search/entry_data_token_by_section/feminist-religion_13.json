    "main_text": "Immanental Themes and Methods || Pragmatizing Feminist Philosophy of Religion\n6. Conclusion\n\nFeminist scholarship in general has had a hard time with religion. And\nmainstream philosophy of religion until recently has had a hard time\nwith feminist scholarship.\n\nGoing forward in the twenty-first century, three particular questions\nstand out. The most significant question on the agenda for future\nreflection concerns religious pluralism and the need to overcome the\nextreme ethnocentrism of Anglo-American philosophy of religion.\nInsofar as the field faces the challenge of encounter with traditions\nexpressing practices and beliefs that are not predominantly associated\nwith European, white, or male modes of understanding, it will be\nrequired to elaborate new models of interpretation, a broader theory\nof evidence, a cross-culturally adequate conception of human\nrationality, and a more complex appraisal of the norms applicable to\ncases of divergent, rival religious claims and disagreements. Insofar\nas feminist philosophy of religion studies the strictly intellectual\ninterpretations of any religious tradition, it will encounter beliefs,\nsymbols, and ideas that are embedded in specific socio-cultural power\nrelations. New work is now needed that reflects on the dynamics of\npower relations, analyzes inherited oppressions, searches for\nalternative wisdom and suppressed symbolism, and risks new accounts of\nthe tricky truth and justification questions in light of religious\npluralism.\n\nTaking seriously the striking plurality of human forms of religious\nlife leads to a second significant question. What theorizations of\nreligion are most adequate for feminists to work with? Before this\nquestion can be addressed with all the philosophical rigor its\ncomplexity demands, feminists must face up to the fact that religion\nis a potent dimension of the lives and desires of contemporary women\naround the world; therefore, philosophizing it away as superstition,\nreactionary ideology, false consciousness, irrational belief, or\npremodern, outmoded hangover simply calls into question, not the\nphenomenon of religion, but the grasp of feminist philosophy itself on\nits subject matter. In our time, the elementary forms of religious\nlife cannot be critiqued along the same old lines that Western secular\nmodernity has taken for granted. In the past, Marxians and Freudians\ncould provide theoretical fuel for the critique of religion for\ngenerations of readers, but their general theory of religion as a\nfunction of projection (of class interests or of the father-image) is\nseverely outdated. Since we cannot divide reality into what is\n\u201creally there\u201d and what is \u201chumanly\nprojected\u201d, and since there is no clear distinction to be drawn\nbetween the properties things have \u201cin themselves\u201d and the\nproperties that are \u201cin us\u201d, projection theories of\nreligion (or of anything else) rest on a purely suppositional basis.\nThey lack explanatory value.\n\nFinally, theorization of the meaning of \u201creligion\u201d in\nfeminist philosophy of religion in a pluralistic age leads to a third\narea of unploughed feminist ground. In addition to thinking about the\nphilosophy in religion, feminists need to think more deeply about the\nreligion in philosophy. What is the significance to feminists of the\n\u201creturn to religion\u201d found, for example, in Emmanuel\nLevinas or Gianni Vattimo? Theological conceptions abound also in the\nwork of Martin Heidegger, Iris Murdoch, Stanley Cavell, Charles\nTaylor, and Martha Nussbaum. The deconstructionist writings of Jacques\nDerrida offer another instance of secular writing in a religious key\nwhose feminist relevance needs to be assessed. Although some\noutstanding and suggestive work has been done by Fergus Kerr (1997),\nJohn Caputo (1997), and Hent de Vries (1999) on the religion in recent\nphilosophy, the feminist corner of the triangle\nreligion-philosophy-feminism remains to be more completely\nconfigured.\n",
