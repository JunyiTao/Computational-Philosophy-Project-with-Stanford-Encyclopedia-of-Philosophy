    "main_text": "Psychological Theories of Depiction || Experiential Theories\n3.1 Experiential Theories\n\nExperiential theories seek to explain depiction in terms of the kind\nof experience a picture causes in a spectator, rather than the kind of\nrepresentational system to which a picture allegedly belongs, or the\nspectator-independent resemblance or isomorphism between a picture and\nthe objects it depicts, or the subpersonal cognitive mechanisms a\npicture may be thought to engage. It remains an open question whether\ntheories of this kind can avoid the charge of circularity, in other\nwords, whether it is possible to define the experience of seeing what\na picture represents without employing the concept of depiction. But\neven among philosophers who believe that this is possible,\nthe exact nature of the experience has been a matter of debate.\n3.1.1 Seeing As and Seeing In\n\nThe simplest experiential theory is that a picture depicts an object\nof a certain kind by causing a spectator to have the visual experience\nshe would normally have if she saw the kind of object it depicts.\nDescartes\u2019 remarks about depiction in his Optics\nsuggest a theory of this kind:\n\n\nThe problem is to know simply how [pictures] can enable the soul to\nhave sensory perceptions of all the various qualities of the objects\nto which they correspond\u2014not to know how they can resemble these\nobjects. ([1637] 1985: I, 166)\n\n\nMichael Newall has recently defended the theory that \u201cpictures\noccasion non-veridical seeing of their subject-matter\u201d (Newall\n2011: 42), which can be interpreted as an endorsement of\nDescartes\u2019s position. But it is generally thought that Descartes\nassimilates pictures in general to trompes l\u2019oeil,\nwhose purpose is (or is commonly thought to be) to cause spectators to\nexperience a kind of illusion. The experiential theories philosophers\nadvocate today tend to define the experience caused by pictures\ndifferently, for this reason. (Newall distinguishes between his own\ntheory and the theory that pictorial experience is a kind of illusion\nin Newall 2011: 23\u201330.)\n\nThe most important twentieth-century source of experiential theories\nis Ernst Gombrich\u2019s book Art and Illusion (1960), based\non the Mellon Lectures he delivered in 1956. In this pathbreaking\nbook, Gombrich argues that realistic or naturalistic pictures\ndo approximate to trompes l\u2019oeil. Indeed, as\nWollheim points out,\n\n\nthe two sets of terms, \u201cnaturalism\u201d,\n\u201cnaturalistic\u201d on the one hand, \u201cillusion\u201d,\n\u201cillusionistic\u201d on the other, are used interchangeably\n\n\nin Art and Illusion (Wollheim 1963: 25). However, no general\ntheory of depiction is presented in Art and Illusion,\nalthough Gombrich compares the perception of pictorial content with\nthe phenomenon of aspect-switching or \u201cseeing as\u201d. He\nintroduces \u201cseeing as\u201d with the ambiguous drawing of a\nduck or a rabbit that Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical\nInvestigations had made famous (Wittgenstein 1953: 194):\n\n\nWe can see the picture as either a rabbit or a duck. It is easy to\ndiscover both readings. It is less easy to describe what happens when\nwe switch from one interpretation to the other. Clearly we do not have\nthe illusion that we are confronted with a \u201creal\u201d duck or\nrabbit. The shape on the paper resembles neither animal very closely.\nAnd yet there is no doubt that the shape transforms itself in some\nsubtle way. (Gombrich 1960: 5)\n\n\nThe significance of the ambiguous image is meant to be that it makes\nus aware of a process that the perception of pictorial content\nalways involves: the process of making a \u201ctentative\nprojection, a trial shot which transforms the image if it turns out to\nbe a hit.\u201d \u201cAmbiguity\u2014rabbit or duck?\u2014is\nclearly the key to the whole problem of image reading\u201d (1960:\n198). Gombrich is commonly described as proposing an \u201cillusion\ntheory\u201d of depiction (e.g., Lopes 1996: 37; Newall 2011: 2), but\nhe emphatically disavowed any such intention, pointing out that the\ntitle of the lectures on which Art and Illusion was based was\nThe Visible World and the Language of Art:\n\n\n[I] never dreamed that this title [Art and Illusion] would\nconvey to some that I considered illusion, or even deception, the main\naim of art. (Gombrich 1973: 195)\n\n\nGombrich explores a variety of fertile ideas in Art and\nIllusion, about the history of style, about realism in the visual\narts, and about the relationship between the content of a\nrepresentation and its use in imaginative play, some of which we shall\nreturn to below. But the comparison between seeing pictures and seeing\naspects provides the focus of Richard Wollheim\u2019s criticism of\nGombrich\u2019s ideas, out of which he develops his own theory of\ndepiction.\n\nWollheim interprets Gombrich as claiming that a spectator cannot be\nsimultaneously conscious of the marks on a picture\u2019s surface and\nthe scene it represents, and that these can only be objects of\nalternating perceptions, although Gombrich does not say this\nexplicitly (Wollheim 1963; cf. Bantinaki 2007). But according to\nWollheim himself, simultaneous awareness of surface and content is\nprecisely what is distinctive about the experience of seeing a\npicture. Furthermore, these are two distinguishable but\n\u201cinseparable\u201d aspects of a single visual experience, and\nnot two experiences somehow combined (Wollheim 1987, 1998, 2003a,b;\nWollheim does not attempt to define a criterion of identity for\nexperiences, so this claim is difficult to assess). Thus, the\nexperience of seeing a picture has a sui generis\nphenomenology, which Wollheim calls \u201ctwofoldness\u201d. The two\naspects of this experience\u2014its configurational aspect\nand its recognitional aspect\u2014are held to be\npsychologically real and to be integrated in a way that also affects\nthe phenomenal character of the experience as a whole.\n\nWollheim names this twofold visual experience \u201cseeing-in\u201d,\nbut he explains that it is not confined to pictures. For example, it\ncan also occur if we follow Leonardo\u2019s famous advice to discover\nlandscapes, battles and grotesque faces in the stains on an old\nwall.\n\n\nSeeing-in is a distinct kind of perception, and it is triggered by the\npresence within the field of vision of a differentiated surface.\n[\u2026] When the surface is right, then an experience with a\ncertain phenomenology will occur, and it is this phenomenology that is\ndistinctive about seeing-in. [\u2026] The distinctive\nphenomenological feature I call \u2018twofoldness\u2019, because,\nwhen seeing-in occurs, two things happen: I am visually aware of the\nsurface I look at, and I discern something standing out in front of,\nor (in certain cases) receding behind, something else. (Wollheim 1987:\n46)\n\n\nAccording to Wollheim, a genealogical parable reveals how\n\u201crepresentation can be explained in terms of\nseeing-in\u201d:\n\n\nIn a community where seeing-in is firmly established, some member of\nthe community\u2014let us call him (prematurely) an artist\u2014sets\nabout marking a surface with the intention of getting others around\nhim to see some definite thing in it: say, a bison. If the\nartist\u2019s intention is successful to the extent that a bison can\nbe seen in the surface as he has marked it, then the community closes\nranks in that someone who does indeed see a bison in it is now held to\nsee the surface correctly, and anyone is held to see it incorrectly if\nhe sees, as he might, something else in it, or nothing at all. Now the\nmarked surface represents a bison. (Wollheim 1987: 46)\n\n\nThis is not meant to be piece of speculative history. The purpose of\nthe story is to show that depiction occurs when the marks on a surface\nare successfully designed to make the seeing-in experience occur. It\nis not enough that this experience should occur. It must, when it\noccurs, fulfil the intention of the \u201cartist\u201d. Notice that\nfor Wollheim, neither trompe l\u2019oeils nor purely\nabstract paintings (i.e., abstract paintings that do not solicit the\nperception of figure-ground relations), are depictions, although they\nmay resemble depictions in certain ways and embody some of the same\naesthetic values. Purely abstract paintings do not produce an\nexperience with the \u201crecognitional\u201d aspect of seeing in,\nwhereas trompes l\u2019oeil do not produce an experience\nwith its \u201cconfigurational\u201d aspect.\n\nWollheim\u2019s theory has been widely discussed and criticised (see\nespecially van Gerwen 2001; Kemp & Mras 2016; Jagnow 2019).\nThe principal objections to it are the following. First, the\nimplication that trompe l\u2019oeils are not\nrepresentational has been contested (Lopes 1996: 49\u201350; Levinson\n[1998] 2001; Newall 2009: 25\u201326; for a critical assessment of\nWollheim\u2019s conception of abstract painting see Caldarola 2012).\nSecond, the suggestion that the figure-ground relationship is a\nuniversal feature of depiction has been challenged (Hyman 2006).\nThird, Wollheim proposes that the standard of correctness, which\ndetermines whether the spectator has correctly perceived the content\nof a picture, \u201cis set \u2026 for each painting by the\nintentions of the artist in so far as they are fulfilled\u201d\n(Wollheim 1987: 46). But this appears to oversimplify the relationship\nbetween the representational content of a picture and the content\nintended by the artist. It is well known that the meaning of an\nuttered sentence can diverge from the intended meaning of the speaker,\nand hard to see why the same should not apply to a picture (see \n\u00a74 of the entry on\n Paul Grice;\n cf. Terrone forthcoming). Fourth, Wollheim declines to offer a detailed\ncharacterisation of seeing in, which explains (a) how the experience\nof seeing a certain kind of object in a surface is related to the\nexperience of seeing the same kind of object face to face (he\ndescribes these experiences as \u201cincommensurable\u201d (1987:\n47)); or (b) how the experience of seeing one certain kind of\nobject in a surface differs from the experience of seeing\nanother kind of object in a surface (Budd 2008a; Hopkins\n1998a). Fifth, Wollheim\u2019s theory is unable to explain the fact\nthat objects are necessarily depicted from an implicit point of view\n(Hopkins 1998a). Finally\u2014a development rather than an\nobjection\u2014it has been argued that, at least in the case of\npictures that have a reference as well as a sense, the experience of\nseeing a picture has a third aspect, i.e. it is\n\u201cthreefold\u201d rather than merely \u201ctwofold\u201d, as\nWollheim suggests (see Brough 2012; Nanay 2018; Mion 2019; cf.\nVoltolini 2018).\n\nDespite these objections, and the elusive character of his writing,\nWollheim\u2019s theory became the key point of reference for\nsubsequent experiential theories of depiction.\n3.1.2 Experienced Resemblance and Make-Believe\n\nExperienced resemblance: As noted above, experiential\ntheories explain depiction in terms of the kind of experience a\npicture causes in a spectator. The two most influential theories that\nhave sought to define this experience more precisely than Wollheim\ndoes are due to Christopher Peacocke and Robert Hopkins, and the\nprincipal concept both employ is that of experienced\nresemblance.\n\nConsider the experience of being struck by someone\u2019s resemblance\nto another person one already knows well, e.g., when one sees the\ngrown-up child of an old friend for the first time in several years.\n(We might speak here of seeing the parent \u2018in\u2019 the child.)\nNo doubt there is a resemblance\u2014in bone-structure,\npigmentation, etc.\u2014with a genetic explanation. But we can\ndescribe the experience as an experience of a resemblance,\nindependently of whether the resemblance actually exists, in what\nrespects, or why. According to theories that employ the concept of\nexperienced resemblance, this is comparable to (though not exactly\nlike) the experience a spectator has when she sees what a picture\nrepresents. Hence, the assumption (made by or attributed to Wollheim\ninter alia) that the object or scene represented by a picture\nis itself somehow perceived by the spectator, or present in\nher experience, is rejected by those who explain depiction in terms of\nexperienced resemblance.\n\nAccording to Peacocke (1987: 386\u2013388), a design or configuration\nof marks on a surface depicts a certain kind of object \u03c6 if, and\nonly if, it is successfully designed to occupy a region of the\nspectator\u2019s two-dimensional visual field that she experiences as\nsimilar in shape to a region in which a \u03c6 could be presented, but\nwithout being experienced (as a sculpture representing a \u03c6 might\nbe) as occupying a three-dimensional region of physical space similar\nto one which could be occupied by a \u03c6. The details of\nPeacocke\u2019s account have been criticized (see Hopkins 1998a; Budd\n2008b; Voltolini 2015), but his appeal to experienced resemblance in\nthe explanation of depiction proved influential.\n\nThe most widely discussed development of Wollheim\u2019s approach is\nby Robert Hopkins. Hopkins adopts Wollheim\u2019s term \u201cseeing-in\u201d to\nrefer to the kind of visual experience a picture is allegedly designed\nto produce. He agrees with Peacocke that seeing-in can be defined in\nterms of experienced resemblance, but he argues that seeing-in is an\nexperience of resemblance in outline shape between the marks\non the surface of a picture and the object or arrangement of objects\nthey represent, rather than shape in the two-dimensional visual field\n(Hopkins 1998a). Outline shape, Hopkins explains, is \u201ca property of\nthings that we regularly perceive, but rarely articulate\u201d (1998b:\n\u00a76), a visible property, but one which is relative to a point of\nview (unlike colour, for example). In fact it appears to be the same\nproperty as Hyman\u2019s occlusion shape, i.e., the 2-D\ncross-section of the cone of light an object subtends to a point of\nview (see above\n \u00a71).\n Unlike Peacocke\u2019s concept of the shape of a region in a\nspectator\u2019s visual field, it is not defined subjectively, in\nterms of the experience of a spectator, but objectively, purely in\nterms of projective geometry. And since seeing-in can be defined in\nterms of outline shape, so can depiction:\n\n\nSeeing-in [\u2026] is essentially the experience of likeness in\nrespect of outline shape. Depiction may then be understood as that\nrepresentation which works through the deliberate generation of this\nexperience. (Hopkins 1998b: \u00a76)\n\n\nHopkins\u2019 definition of seeing-in addresses several influential\nobjections to Wollheim\u2019s own approach. In particular, it avoids\nthe implication that the figure-ground relationship is a universal\nfeature of depiction; it explains precisely how the experience of\nseeing a certain kind of object in a surface is related to the\nexperience of seeing the same kind of object face to face, and how the\nexperience of seeing one kind of object in a surface differs from the\nexperience of seeing another kind of object in a surface; and it\nexplains the fact that objects are necessarily depicted from an\nimplicit point of view. But Hopkins does not claim that there is\ninvariably an exact match between the content of a picture and what\ncan be seen in it (Hopkins 1998a: 128; see also Brown 2010; Dilworth\n2005, 2010). Drawing on his or her knowledge of pictorial culture and\nconvention, an educated spectator will discount some features of the\nobject seen in a picture\u2014such as deviations from normal human\nanatomy\u2014attributing them to the prevalent pictorial style,\nrather than including them in the picture\u2019s intended content. In\nthis way, Hopkins draws a distinction between the content of\nseeing-in, which is determined by experienced resemblance in\noutline shape alone, and pictorial content, which also\ndepends on the artist\u2019s intentions (Hopkins 1998a).\n\nHowever, several difficulties remain. First, it is unclear how\nHopkins\u2019s theory can accommodate Lopes\u2019s independence\nconstraint. As we have seen (see above,\n \u00a71.2),\n according to Lopes, if a theory implies that a spectator perceives a\npicture\u2019s content by perceiving a resemblance between the marks\non its surface and the kind of object which it represents, then she\nmust be able to perceive this resemblance \u201cwithout first\nknowing\u201d what the picture represents. But a spectator\u2019s\n\u201cexperience of likeness in respect of outline shape\u201d may\ndepend on what she sees in a picture, Lopes claims, and\n\u201cexperienced resemblance cannot explain depiction if it is\nbeholden to [i.e., explained by] depiction\u201d (2005a:\n16\u201317). Second, Hopkins agrees with Wollheim that the standard\nof correctness for a spectator\u2019s perception of the content of a\npicture, \u201cis set \u2026 for each painting by the intentions of\nthe artist in so far as they are fulfilled\u201d, and therefore faces\nthe same Gricean objection (see above,\n \u00a73.1).\n Finally, every experiential theory of depiction faces a difficulty in\nexplaining how the shapes (or outline shapes) of the marks on the\nsurface of a picture constrain the shapes (or outline shapes) of the\nobjects they represent. On the one hand, if the only constraint is\nthat they must be such as to generate an experience of the kind the\ntheory postulates, then it is difficult to explain how this experience\ndiffers from a hallucination caused by an optical stimulus, such as\nthe mysterious blank canvas described by Flint Schier, which causes\nthe illusory experience of seeing a portrait of Marilyn Monroe, but\npresumably does not depict anything at all (Schier 1986:\n197). On the other hand, if there must be a direct optical or\ngeometrical correspondence between the shapes (or outline shapes) of\nthe marks and the shapes (or outline shapes) of the objects they\nrepresent, so that we can perceive the latter by perceiving\nthe former, then the theory is no longer purely experiential, and\ndepends ultimately on the kind of relationship between surface and\ncontent postulated (for different reasons) by Hyman, Kulvicki, and\nVoltolini. (See Hyman 2006, Kulvicki 2014, Voltolini 2015. For\nHopkins\u2019 replies to these objections, see Hopkins 2003 and\n2005.)\n\nMake-believe: An alternative characterisation of the\nexperience generated by pictures, which refers to the imagination, is\nproposed by Kendall Walton (1990, 2008a,b, 2011) in the context of a\nwider theory of artistic representation. Following Gombrich (1963),\nand drawing on Ryle\u2019s seminal writings on imagination and\npretence (Ryle 1949: ch. 8; cf. White 1990), Walton claims that\npictures are props in visual games of make-believe, which prescribe\nvisual imaginings with a particular content. When one engages in the\nright way with a picture of a certain kind of object or scene, one\nimagines that one is seeing an object or scene of that kind:\n\n\nParticipation in visual games of make-believe using pictures as props\nis a complex perceptual and imaginative activity. [\u2026] At a\nminimum, one imagines seeing the depicted objects or objects of the\nkinds that are depicted, as one scans the picture surface. One also\nimagines one\u2019s actual visual experience of the picture to be a\nvisual experience of these objects or objects of these kinds.\n[\u2026] I claim that this complex experience constitutes,\napproximately, what Wollheim and others call seeing trees, fields,\netc. in the picture. (Walton 2011: 396\u2013397)\n\n\nWalton\u2019s general theory of make-believe is widely regarded as an\nimportant contribution to the philosophy of art. But his theory of\ndepiction faces the same difficulty as other experiential theories in\nexplaining how the shapes (or outline shapes) of the marks on the\nsurface of a picture constrain the shapes (or outline shapes) of the\nobjects they represent, or the imaginative games they invite\nspectators to engage in. Furthermore, some of Walton\u2019s critics\nhave denied that visual imagination is an essential feature of picture\nperception (Savile 1986); and others have denied that the concept of a\nvisual game of make-believe can capture the experience of seeing in,\non the grounds that Walton fails to integrate the\n\u201crecognitional\u201d and \u201cconfigurational\u201d aspects\nof the experience, or at least fails to integrate them in the right\nway. However, the force of this objection is blunted to some degree by\nthe disagreement among Wollheim\u2019s followers about the right way\nof explaining how the experience of seeing in is integrated. (For\nobjections to Walton, see Wollheim 1998, 2003b; Budd 2008a; Nanay\n2004. For Walton\u2019s replies to objections, see Walton 2008b,c.\nFor an alternative analysis of seeing in in terms of imagining, see\nStock 2008. For different views about the \u201cintegration\u201d of\nseeing in, see Abell & Bantinaki 2010; Newall 2015; Voltolini\n2015.)\n\nInflection: As noted above, the alleged\n\u201cintegration\u201d of seeing in has been a matter of debate.\nThis is especially true with respect to cases where the marks on the\nsurface of a picture are not merely a means by which the spectator\nperceives its content, but are designed by the artist to contribute to\nthe content of the picture in virtue of their character as marks. For\nexample, in several pastel drawings made in the 1880s, in which\n Degas depicts a woman drying herself,\n he trace of the pastel rubbing against the paper\u2019s surface\nsubliminally registers the motion of the towel against the\nwoman\u2019s skin. In this kind of case, as Michael Podro\nexplains,\n\n\nthe recognition of the subject is extended and elaborated by the way\nits conditions of representation, the medium and the psychological\nadjustments the painting invites become absorbed into its content.\n(Podro 1998: 2)\n\n\nThe spectator\u2019s experience of this phenomenon has been called\n\u201cinflected seeing in\u201d, and both the phenomenon and the experience have\nreceived considerable attention, both from philosophers who maintain\nthat depiction can be defined in experiential terms, and from those\nwho doubt or deny this. Lopes (2005a) makes the interesting claim that\ninflection solves the puzzle of mimesis: in other words, it\nexplains why we value or enjoy seeing pictures of kinds of objects\nthat we do not value or enjoy seeing face-to-face (The seminal\ntreatment of this problem is in Aristotle\u2019s Poetics (Book\nIV). Noteworthy discussions of inflection include Hopkins 2010, Nanay\n2010, and Voltolini 2013. Broader discussions of the kinds of\npictorial experience that pictures in different styles can elicit\ninclude Lopes 2005a, Cavedon-Taylor 2011, Newall 2011, and Bradley\n2014.)\n3.2 Recognition-Based Theories\n\nWe noted in\n \u00a73.1\n that experiential theories seek to explain depiction in terms of the\nkind of experience a picture causes in a spectator, rather than the\nsubpersonal cognitive mechanisms a picture is thought to engage. Some\nphilosophers therefore maintain that theories which explain depiction\nin terms of the propensity of a picture to activate a\nspectator\u2019s recognitional skills are not experiential theories,\non the grounds that recognition can occur without experience (Matthen\n2005: 25\u201326; Newall 2011: 21\u201323). Others either claim or\nassume, on the contrary, that recognition is a kind of\nexperience, at least the kind of recognition that is stimulated by a\npicture (Squires 1969; Schier 1986).\n\nThe basic thought that underlies recognition-based theories of\ndepiction is that a picture must be recognisable:\n\n\nIt must be the kind of thing that can be connected up with what the\nartist had in mind, if looked at in the right way by people with\naptitude and experience. [\u2026] Ultimately, we establish what is\nrecognisable by reference to what is recognised. (Squires 1969:\n203)\n\n\nThe same thought is developed by Schier. As noted above (see\n \u00a72),\n Schier claims that our interpretation of pictures, unlike our\ninterpretation of words, is generated naturally:\n\n\nOnce you have succeeded in an initial pictorial interpretation\n[\u2026] you should then be able to interpret novel icons without\nbeing privy to additional stipulations given only that you can\nrecognise the object or state of affairs depicted. (Schier 1986:\n43)\n\n\nAccordingly, Schier argues that depiction can be defined in terms of\nnatural generativity and recognition: a picture is the kind of\nrepresentation that causes naturally generated interpretations in\ncompetent spectators by activating their recognitional skills. Thus,\n\u201cpictures are symbols whose interpretation can be causally\nexplained by relevant recognitional abilities\u201d (Schier 1986:\n49). Specifically, \u201ca picture of O is precisely something\nwhich can trigger the interpreter\u2019s O-recognising\nabilities\u201d (Schier 1986: 195).\n\nSchier\u2019s basic thought was subsequently incorporated into an\neclectic theory of depiction by Dominic Lopes (1996). Drawing on\nGareth Evans\u2019s information-theoretic account of reference (Evans\n1982; see \u00a72.3 of the entry on\n reference)\n and Kendall Walton\u2019s controversial claim that photographs are\n\u201ctransparent\u201d (Walton 1984), as well as Schier\u2019s\nrecognition-based theory of depiction, Lopes defends the following\nideas.\n\nFirst, pictures belong to \u201cinformation systems\u201d, and\ntransmit perceptual information from their subjects (Lopes 1996: 107),\nthereby engaging (and also extending) the recognitional skills\nspectators exercise in ordinary visual perception. \u201cThe ability\nto work out what pictures depict covaries with the ability to\nrecognize their depicta in the flesh\u201d (2005a: 170). Second,\nLopes adopts Walton\u2019s claim that photographs are\n\u201ctransparent\u201d, i.e., spectators literally see the\nobjects that appear in photographs, as if through a pane of glass, and\nnot merely visual records or sources of information about them.\nHowever, Lopes extends this claim to encompass every kind of picture:\n\u201cthere is as much reason to believe that we see through\npaintings and drawings as through photographs\u201d (1996: 181).\nThird, pictures present aspects of their subjects, by making both\n\u201ccommitments\u201d and \u201cnon-commitments\u201d regarding\ntheir properties: \u201cEvery picture represents its subject as\nhaving some property that precludes it from making commitments about\nsome other property\u201d (Lopes 1996: 125). For example, a picture\nthat depicts a man sporting a beard makes a commitment regarding the\nproperty of being hirsute, but by the same token is non-commital\nregarding the property of having a dimpled chin. Explicit\n\u201cnon-commitment\u201d distinguishes depiction from other kinds\nof representation. (For criticism see Herwitz 2000, Savile 2000,\nKulvicki 2006.) Fourth, pictorial styles, or systems of pictorial\nrepresentation, differ from each other in the kinds of aspects they\ntypically present. Pictorial competence is relative to specific styles\nor systems: to be able to interpret a picture, one needs to have the\nrecognitional skills corresponding to the system to which it belongs\n(Lopes 1996: 152\u20133).\n\nThese ideas face various difficulties, some of which we have already\nconsidered in connection with other experiential theories. First,\nLopes\u2019s ideas about the transmission of perceptual information\nand the transparency of pictures are difficult to apply to pictures of\nfictional individuals and genre pictures (Hopkins 1997). Second, the\ntransparency claim has been criticised even in the case of\nphotographs, where the problem of fictional subjects and genre\npictures does not normally arise (Currie 1995). Third, the claim that\npictures differ from other kinds of representations in that only\npictures explicitly \u201cnon-commit\u201d to properties has been\nchallenged (Kulvicki 2006). Finally, as we have seen, Walton\u2019s\ntheory that picture are props in games of visual make-believe does not\nseem capable of explaining how the shapes of the marks on the surface\nof a picture constrain the shapes of the objects they represent, or\nthe imaginative games they invite spectators to engage in.\nRecognition-based theories are open to a similar objection. Various\ntheories of depiction are compatible with the claim that pictures\nactivate the same recognitional skills as the kinds of objects they\ndepict. The question on which they differ is why they do so. For\nexample, is it because the shape of a region on a picture\u2019s\nsurface is identical to the occlusion shape of the object it depicts?\nOr is it because part of a picture\u2019s surface occupies a region\nof the spectator\u2019s two-dimensional visual field that she\nexperiences as similar in shape to a region in which the kind of\nobject that it depicts could be presented? Or is it for some other\nreason? Without an answer to this question, the problem of explaining\nhow pictures represent is elaborated by introducing ideas about\nrecognition, natural generativity and transparency, but it is not\nsolved (Newman 1998; cf. Neander 1987, Sartwell 1991).\n4. Realism\n\nAs we have seen, any plausible theory of depiction will need to\naccommodate the wide variety of styles of picture-making. Art history\ncontains more sophisticated and fertile treatments of the concept of\nstyle than philosophy does, notably by Heinrich Wolfflin (1950), Alois\nRiegl ([1893] 1992), Erwin Panofsky (1997), Ernst Gombrich (1968), and\nMeyer Schapiro (1994). However, one topic in the theory of style on\nwhich there is a substantial philosophical literature is\nrealism.\n\nThe term \u201crealism\u201d and equivalent terms in other European\nlanguages were introduced into literary and art criticism during the\nnineteenth century, and paintings and sculptures are still commonly\ndescribed as realistic (faithful, true to nature, etc.) by critics and\nhistorians of art. However, many philosophers and historians of art\nsince the 1920s have expressed scepticism about the idea that some\nstyles of art represent reality more truthfully or faithfully than\nothers (Jakobson [1921/1971] 1987; Steinberg [1953] 1972; Nochlin\n1971; Stewart 1997). The most influential exponent of this view is\nGoodman, who argues that realism cannot be a matter of fidelity to\nnature, and cannot be measured by resemblance to reality, because our\njudgements about fidelity to nature depend on our visual habits, which\nare shaped in turn by the visual culture we inhabit, and the images we\nare used to seeing and interpreting. Resemblance cannot be a\n\u201cconstant and independent\u201d standard against which works of\nart can be measured, because \u201cthe criteria of resemblance vary\nwith changes in representational practice\u201d (Goodman 1968: 39).\n\u201cThe literal or realistic or naturalistic system of\nrepresentation\u201d, Goodman claims, \u201cis simply the customary\none\u201d.\n\n\nRealism is relative, determined by the system of representation\nstandard for a given culture or person at a given time. Newer or older\nor alien systems are accounted artificial or unskilled. (1968: 37)\n\n\nGoodman\u2019s argument has been challenged on several grounds.\nFirst, the realistic system of representation cannot simply be the\nstandard or customary one, because as an artistic style evolves,\nspectators are inevitably less accustomed to innovative subjects and\ntechniques than they are to the ones these modify or replace. So if\nGoodman\u2019s claim were true, an artistic style could never become\nmore realistic, in the eyes of spectators living at the time. But the\nhistorical record proves, on the contrary, that it does (Newall 2011:\n119\u2013121). Second, Goodman exaggerates the extent to which visual\nexperience is modified by art. Oscar Wilde famously claimed that there\nhad been no fog in London before it appeared in Turner\u2019s\npaintings. But in fact, writers generally described optical effects\nlong before painters learned to represent them. For example, the\nspinning highlights on a chariot-wheel were described by the Latin\npoet Prudentius many centuries before Velazquez captured this effect\nin paint. Third, even if the art we see does modify our visual habits\nand influence the resemblances we perceive to some extent, it does not\nfollow that realism cannot consist in resemblance or fidelity to\nnature. Compare the relationship between theory and observation in\nscience. The growth of scientific knowledge has enabled us to refine\nour observations of natural phenomena, and these observations have in\nturn enabled us to test scientific theories. There is nothing\nsuspicious about this interaction between theory and observation, and\nnothing that should make us wonder whether we possess a\n\u201cconstant and independent\u201d standard, with which scientific\ntheories can be assessed (see \u00a74; of the entry on\n theory and observation in science\n and  \u00a73 of the entry on \n Popper).\n\nIt is now generally agreed that the concepts of resemblance and\nfidelity to nature are too vague and metaphorical to explain what\nrealism is, and that \u201crealist\u201d or \u201crealistic\u201d\nart proceeds from specific values, methods and viewpoints, no less\nthan other kinds of art (Schapiro 1978). Furthermore, confusion about\nrealism is compounded by the fact that the term is used to describe a\nvariety of period styles, including late medieval and early\nRenaissance art, Dutch painting in the seventeenth century, and French\npainting in the nineteenth century. But it does not follow that\n\u201crealism\u201d is merely an honorific term, which we apply to\nart in a familiar style, or that fidelity to nature is a vacuous\nidea.\n\nThe fundamental distinction we need to draw, in order to clarify the\nconcept of realism, is between realism in subject-matter and realism\nin technique (Hyman 2005). Realism in subject-matter is about the\nchoice of subject-matter and the manner in which it is treated.\nRealistic art, in this sense, represents the lower social classes,\ncomic as opposed to tragic material, daily life as opposed to myth.\nFor example, in the paintings of Courbet, Manet and Degas the\ntraditional hierarchy of genres, which promoted the representation of\nhistory, myth or allegory, is definitively set aside, and the everyday\nlives of people belonging to the lower social classes are taken\nseriously, and placed in a contemporary social setting, as they are in\nthe novels of Balzac and Flaubert.\n\nRealism in technique is a different phenomenon, which can be traced\nback to the revolutionary developments in Greek art between the sixth\nand fourth centuries BC, specifically, developments in anatomy and in\nthe representation of space and light. Since philosophers and art\ntheorists abandoned the idea that realism can be defined in terms of\nfidelity to nature or resemblance, most of those who do not regard\nrealism as a purely ideological concept or a sham (e.g., Stewart 1997;\nNeer 2002) have defined realism in technique in terms of information:\neither the quantity of information recorded in a picture (Gombrich\n1960; Schier 1986), or the quantity of relevant or visually salient\ninformation (Lopes 1996; Sartwell 1994; Abell 2006, 2007; Kulvicki\n2006), or the ease with which information issues (Goodman 1968), or\nthe range of information (Hyman 2005), is said to be the, or the\nprincipal, measure of realistic art. (See also Walton 1990; Chasid\n2007; and Newall 2011 for comparable views.)\n\nAccording to Hyman, realism in technique can be defined in terms of\nthree characteristics: accuracy, animation, and\nmodality (Hyman 2005: 40\u201346). Accuracy means the\naccurate depiction of a kind of material or object or activity, such\nas water or satin, a palm tree or a dove, sleeping, galloping or\nmaking love. Animation combines mobility with the expression of\nemotion, character or thought (see also Penrose 1973: 268). The term\n\u201cmodality\u201d refers to the expressive potential available to\nartists during a particular phase in the development of an artistic\ntradition, in other words, the range of kinds of information that the\ntechnical resources available to artists allow them to record:\n\n\nThe technical resources of pictorial art are always limited in their\nexpressive range, as languages are also bound to be; and these\ntechnical resources, like languages, can expand in different\ndirections to express new ideas and new observations. The development\nof realistic techniques is the expansion of the modality of art, in\nother words, the expansion of what it is possible for art to\nrepresent. (Hyman 2009: 497)\n\n\nThe commonest argument debunking the idea of a realistic artistic\nstyle depends on the thought that artistic styles are analogous to\nlanguages (see above,\n \u00a72\n for references). The comparison is intended to underline the extent\nto which artists rely on systems of conventions, and to discourage the\nidea that some styles are more truthful, or closer to reality, than\nothers. For the things we say are not truer or closer to reality if we\nsay them in French, or English, or Chinese. However, the analogy\nactually supports the claim that expressive potential is the measure\nof realistic art. For languages are not like codes or scripts. For\nexample, the Hieratic and Hieroglyphic Egyptian scripts do not differ\nin the range of information they can be used to record, and neither do\nSemaphore and Morse code. But languages obviously differ widely in\ntheir expressive powers, and have expanded rapidly in some periods of\nhistory. Thus, the difference between trecento and seicento Italian\nart is comparable to the difference between the English of\nChaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales and the English of\nMilton\u2019s Paradise Lost, not to that between Morse Code\nand Semaphore or between English and French (see Ackerman 1978:\n157\u2013160; Hyman 2005: 47).",
