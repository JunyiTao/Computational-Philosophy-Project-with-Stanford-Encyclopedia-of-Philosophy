    "main_text": "Concepts in Molecular Biology || Mechanism\n2.1 Mechanism\n\nMolecular biologists discover and explain by identifying and\nelucidating mechanisms, such as DNA replication, protein synthesis,\nand the myriad mechanisms of gene expression. The phrase \u201ctheory\nof molecular biology\u201d was not used above and for good reason;\ngeneral knowledge in the field is represented by diagrams of\nmechanisms (Machamer, Darden, and Craver 2000; Darden 2006a, 2006b;\nCraver and Darden 2013; Baetu 2017). Discovering the mechanism that\nproduces a phenomenon is an important accomplishment for several\nreasons. First, knowledge of a mechanism shows how something works:\nelucidated mechanisms provide understanding. Second, knowing how a\nmechanism works allows predictions to be made based upon the\nregularity in mechanisms. For example, knowing how the mechanism of\nDNA base pairing works in one species allows one to make predictions\nabout how it works in other species, even if conditions or inputs are\nchanged. Third, knowledge of mechanisms potentially allows one to\nintervene to change what the mechanism produces, to manipulate its\nparts to construct experimental tools, or to repair a broken, diseased\nmechanism. In short, knowledge of elucidated mechanisms provides\nunderstanding, prediction, and control. Given the general importance\nof mechanisms and the fact that mechanisms play such a central role in\nthe field of molecular biology, it is not surprising that philosophers\nof biology pioneered analyzing the concept of mechanism (see the entry\non mechanisms in science).\n\nStarting in the 1990s, a number of philosophers focused squarely on\nhow the concept of a mechanism functions in science generally and\nmolecular biology specifically (Glennan and Illari 2017; see also the\nentry on\n mechanisms in science).\n A number of characterizations of what a mechanism is have emerged\nover the years (Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2005; Glennan 2002; Machamer,\nDarden, and Craver 2000). Phyllis McKay Illari and Jon Williamson have\nmore recently offered a characterization that draws on the essential\nfeatures of all the earlier contributions:\n\n\nA mechanism for a phenomenon consists of entities and activities\norganized in such a way that they are responsible for the phenomenon.\n(Illari and Williamson 2012: 120)\n\n\nAs an example, consider the phenomenon of DNA replication. As Watson\nand Crick (1953a) famously noted upon discovery of the structure of\nDNA, the macromolecule\u2019s structure pointed to the mechanism of\nDNA replication:\n\n\nIt has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have\npostulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the\ngenetic material.\n\n\nIn short, the double helix of DNA (an entity with an organization)\nunwinds (an activity) and new component parts (entities) bond (an\nactivity) to both parts of the unwound DNA helix. DNA is a nucleic\nacid composed of several subparts: a sugar-phosphate backbone and\nnucleic acid bases. When DNA unwinds, the bases exhibit weak charges,\nproperties that result from slight asymmetries in the molecules. These\nweak charges allow a DNA base and its complement to engage in the\nactivity of forming hydrogen (weak polar) chemical bonds; the\nspecificity of this activity is due to the topological arrangements of\nthe weak polar charges in the subparts of the base. Ultimately,\nentities with polar charges enable the activity of hydrogen bond\nformation. After the complementary bases align, then the backbone\nforms via stronger covalent bonding. The mechanism proceeds with\nunwinding and bonding together (activities) new parts, to produce two\nhelices (newly formed entities) that are (more or less faithfully)\ncopies of the parent helix. (This process of \u201csemi-conservative\nreplication\u201d and the Meselson-Stahl experiment that confirmed it\nare discussed in more detail in\n Section 3.4.)\n\nScientists rarely depict all the particular details when describing a\nmechanism; representations are usually schematic, often depicted in\ndiagrams (see the entry on\n models in science).\n Such representations may be called a \u201cmodel of a\nmechanism\u201d, or \u201cmechanism schema\u201d. A mechanism\nschema is a truncated abstract description of a mechanism that can be\ninstantiated by filling it with more specific descriptions of\ncomponent entities and activities. An example is James Watson\u2019s\n(1965) diagram of his version of the central dogma of molecular\nbiology:\n\n\nDNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 protein.\n\n\nThis is a schematic representation (with a high degree of abstraction)\nof the mechanism of protein synthesis, which can be instantiated with\ndetails of DNA base sequence, complementary RNA sequence, and the\ncorresponding order of amino acids in the protein produced by the more\nspecific mechanism. Molecular biology textbooks are replete with\ndiagrams of mechanism schemas. A mechanism schema can be instantiated\nto yield a description of a particular mechanism. In contrast, a\nmechanism sketch cannot (yet) be instantiated; components are (as yet)\nunknown. Sketches have black boxes for missing components or grey\nboxes whose function is known but whose entities and activities that\ncarry out that function are not yet elucidated. Such sketches guide\nnew research to fill in the details (Craver and Darden 2013).\n",
