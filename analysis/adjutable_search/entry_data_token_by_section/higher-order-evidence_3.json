As\nseveral epistemologists have pointed out, there are strange\nconsequences for anyone who believes a theory on which\nhigher-order evidence has first-order effects: it seems that this\nbelief is liable to undercut its own justification. Let\u2019s\nconsider a candidate principle on which higher-order evidence can\ndefeat first-order beliefs; call it \u201cHOD\u201d (for\n\u201chigher-order defeat\u201d). Now consider a person, Sam, who\nbelieves that HOD is a true principle of rationality. What happens if\nSam\u2019s belief in HOD is itself a target of higher-order\ndefeat? This might happen through peer disagreement (which is the\nfocus of most of the literature on this objection) or other means.\nAfterwards, according to HOD, Sam cannot rationally believe HOD.\n\nThis might already seem like a problem to some: a true theory of\nrationality should not (arguably) undermine our justification for\nbelieving it. And taking it a step further, it can look like the\ntheory is either paradoxical or incoherent. If HOD can call for its\nown rejection (in the cases where belief in HOD is itself undermined),\nhow can it give us coherent directions? Suppose Sam\u2019s\nhigher-order evidence targets two beliefs simultaneously: his belief\nabout some proposition P, and his belief about HOD itself.\nHOD tells him to reduce confidence in P. But since HOD is\nundermined as well, it is arguably also telling him not to\nreduce confidence (or to reduce confidence to a lesser degree). These\nrecommendations are incompatible, yielding the worry that HOD is\ninternally inconsistent. On the other hand, the worry about paradox\narises when we consider what happens when Sam begins to revise his\nbeliefs. Once HOD is undermined, suppose Sam no longer believes it,\nand goes back to revise the beliefs that he formed on its basis. But\nhis last application of HOD was what led to his doubting HOD\u2014so\nif he \u201cundoes\u201d that step, he\u2019ll believe HOD again!\nBut then his belief in HOD will be undermined by his higher-order\nevidence, and the loop will start over. (For further discussion see\nElga 2010, Weatherson 2013, Christensen 2013 and 2021a, and Bradley\n2019. See Roush 2009 for discussion of a related phenomenon.)\n\nAdvocates of higher-order defeat have offered a few different\nresponses to this class of objections. One option, proposed by Elga\n(2010), is to say that principles like HOD are exempt from\nundermining. (Elga\u2019s view draws on an argument found in Lewis\n1971 and H. Field 2000, for the conclusion that our most fundamental\nbelief-forming methods must be self-recommending.) Another option is\nto say that our attitude towards principles like HOD is not one of\nbelief, but some other type of attitude. (See Goldberg 2013,\nBarnett 2019, and Fleisher 2021 for examples of this approach.)\nFinally, one might simply deny that Sam is obligated to enter the\nparadoxical loop once his belief in HOD is undermined. Christensen\n(2013, 2021a, 2021b) argues along these lines. The loop gets started\nif we think that once Sam rationally doubts HOD, he is rationally\nrequired to stop adopting the beliefs that HOD recommends, and instead\nadopt whichever beliefs he now regards as most rational. But this\nthought is not part of HOD, and we are free to deny it\u2014we can\nmaintain that HOD is true, and rationally binding even for those who\nrationally doubt it. (This is different from saying that HOD must be\nself-recommending; on Elga\u2019s proposal, one should\nbelieve that one should always follow HOD, and also always\nfollow it. On Christensen\u2019s, one should always follow HOD,\nregardless of what one should believe one should do.) This response\nwould bypass the paradox. But it comes at what some defenders of HOD\nsee as a cost: it means we must accept some instances of rational\nepistemic akrasia. If Sam revises his belief in HOD, but continues to\nfollow it, as this suggestion would have him do, he will end up with a\nbelief state whose rationality he doubts.\n\nIn the face of these difficulties, some epistemologists conclude that\nhigher-order defeat is simply not a genuine phenomenon. These views\nare discussed next. In sections 3 and 4, we will come back to the\noptions for accommodating higher-order defeat.\n",
