    "main_text": "\n\nAlfred Tarski (1901\u20131983) described himself as \u201ca\nmathematician (as well as a logician, and perhaps a philosopher of a\nsort)\u201d (1944, p. 369). He is widely considered as one of the\ngreatest logicians of the twentieth century (often regarded as second\nonly to G\u00f6del), and thus as one of the greatest logicians of all\ntime. Among philosophers he is especially known for his mathematical\ncharacterizations of the concepts of truth and logical consequence for\nsentences of classical formalized languages, and to a lesser extent\nfor his mathematical characterization of the concept of a logical\nconstant for expressions of those same languages. Among logicians and\nmathematicians he is in addition famous for his work on set theory,\nmodel theory and algebra, which includes results and developments such\nas the Banach-Tarski paradox, the theorem on the indefinability of\ntruth (see section 2 below), the completeness and decidability of\nelementary algebra and geometry, and the notions of cardinal, ordinal,\nrelation and cylindric algebras. After a biographical sketch, this\nentry offers a condensed exposition of the parts of Tarski\u2019s\nwork that are most relevant to philosophy, his theories of truth,\nlogical consequence and logical constants. In this exposition we have\nattempted to remain as close as possible to Tarski\u2019s original\npresentations, reducing to a minimum the number of claims that might\nbe controversial philosophically or exegetically. The final section on\nfurther reading refers the reader to other entries and works on\ncritical and exegetical aspects of Tarski\u2019s work not touched\nupon in this entry.\n",
