    "main_text": "Major Philosophical Themes and Methods in Philo || Negative theology and Providence\n4.2 Negative theology and Providence\n\nPhilo is also considered the founder of negative theology in the\nhistory of monotheistic faith. Given the association of his faith with\ncontemporary forms of Skepticism, he was also the founder of at least\na kind of fideism, i.e., a doctrine in which faith is the foundation\nof all essential truths. His apparent versatility in exegesis can give\nthe impression that his only purpose is to make philosophical themes\nand words coincide with the text of Bible. However, though Philo is\nnot as systematic as Plotinus, there is much more coherence in his\nphysics and metaphysics than one might think. Even John Dillon, hardly\nan unconditional admirer of Philo, argues that \u201che follows a\nsystem in which the supreme principle is the One\u201d, meaning not\nthe God of philosophers but the personal God of Judaism (1977: 155).\nThe problem of possible philosophical antecedents to Philo\u2019s\nconception of an unknowable and ineffable God is a complex one. Such a\nhypothesis cannot be dismissed, but there is no clear evidence of its\ntruth. In any case, negativity is, par excellence, the manner\nof speaking in the best way possible about God. It is not the only\none; there is also the possibility of declaring His perfection and\ninfinite glory. And metaphors, like those of monarchy, the sower, and\nthe sun, are still different. But the uiae negationis,\neminentiae (all that is good has its origin in God), and\nanalogiae (there is a kind of analogy of being between\nCreator and creature), though perfectly compatible with each other,\nare only poor human means to suggest Him who can\u2019t be seen,\nnamed, nor known. Nevertheless, one of the most interesting\ncomparative means to evoke man\u2019s relation to God is the\nvocabulary of mysteries, for example when Philo says in Cher.\n49: \n\n\nI myself was initiated under Moses the God-beloved into his great\nmysteries, yet when I saw the prophet Jeremiah and knew him to be not\nonly himself enlightened, but a worthy minister of the holy secrets, I\nwas not slow to become his disciple. \n\n\nThe comparison with the Eleusinian mysteries is so precise that Moses\nis often called \u201chierophantos\u201d, initiated in the\nSinai to mysteries most obscure. As it had held in Eleusis, Philo\nspeaks of \u201clittle mysteries\u201d and \u201cgreat\nmysteries\u201d, the former leading to liberation from passions, the\nlatter from sensations. Many other elements, especially those of the\nsacred banquet, resonate with the theme of the mysteries. Many\nscholars suggested that Philo situated himself in the Platonic\ntradition of philosophically transposing the Eleusinian mysteries. In\nthis perspective, the mystery is the allegoric method itself.\nHowever, one could object to this interpretation that the meaning of a\nmetaphor is not monolithic. It depends in great part on the identity\nof the addressee, about which we know little. Indeed, there was at\nleast one ambiguity: did Philo want to prove to hypothetic Greek\nreaders that Eleusinian mysteries were shadowy images of the only true\nmysteries, the Jewish ones? Was he using a kind of spiritual\nlingua franca elaborated during the pluralistic honeymoon at\nthe beginning of the Ptolemaic period? Still, no element of the\nmysteries\u2019 lexicon could trace a shift with regard to the theme\nof the impossibility of knowing God.\n\nEven the man who was the closest to God, Moses, could not see Him in\nthe Sinai. God is \u201cineffable, inconceivable and\nincomprehensible\u201d (Mut. 15). This means that without\nRevelation, it would be impossible to say anything about Him that bore\nrelation with truth. At the same time, the absolute transcendence of\nGod, as theorized by Philo, could have implied His perfect\nindifference to the world of matter, time, and sensibility. Yet,\nthrough His providence, God is present in the world He created. From a\nphilosophical point of view, the problem of what Radice calls\n\u201cthe antinomy of transcendence and providence\u201d played a\ngreat role even in the period before Middle Platonism (2009: 128). The\nreturn to Platonic transcendence was the major philosophical\ncharacteristic of Philo\u2019s age. It is highly improbable, however,\nthat philosophy had a determining role in shaping his faith and\nbeliefs. More probable is that he perceived himself in the tradition\nof biblical translators, the Septuagint being so highly praised by him\nin the Vita Mosis. In a time when Egypt was Ptolemaic, these\ntranslations had both political and cultural purposes. In\nPhilo\u2019s time, the main center of Greek power was cultural. To\ncomment upon the Bible with philosophical concepts was, in a certain\nway, to translate it into the language of the new cultural elite, the\nRoman as well as Greek. Regardless, the central idea was that the word\nof God had to be mediated to become accessible outside of Israel. From\nthis point of view, mediation was a central Philonian concept, not\nonly linguistically and culturally, but also ontologically: in\nSomn. 1.62, he says that God fulfilled His Word with His\nincorporeal powers.\n",
