    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nAugustine (Aurelius Augustinus) lived from 13 November 354 to 28\nAugust 430. He was born in Thagaste in Roman Africa (modern Souk Ahras\nin Algeria). His mother Monnica (d. 388), a devout Christian, seems to\nhave exerted a deep but not wholly unambiguous influence on his\nreligious development. His father Patricius (d. 372) was baptized on\nhis deathbed. Augustine himself was made a catechumen early in his\nlife. His studies of grammar and rhetoric in the provincial centers of\nMadauros and Carthage, which strained the financial resources of his\nmiddle-class parents, were hoped to pave his way for a future career\nin the higher imperial administration. In Carthage at the age of ca.\n18, he found a mistress with whom he lived in a monogamous union for\nca. 14 years and who bore him a son, Adeodatus, who was baptized\ntogether with his father in Milan and died a little later (ca. 390)\naged 18. Ca. 373 Augustine became a \u201chearer\u201d\n(auditor) of Manicheism, a dualistic religion with Persian\norigins that, in Northern Africa, had developed into a variety of\nChristianity (and was persecuted by the state as a heresy). His\nadherence to Manicheism lasted for nine years and was strongly opposed\nby Monnica. Though probably active as a Manichean apologist and\nmissionary, he never became one of the sect\u2019s\n\u201celect\u201d (electi), who were committed to\nasceticism and sexual abstinence. In 383 he moved to Milan, then the\ncapital of the western half of the Empire, to become a publicly paid\nprofessor of rhetoric of the city and an official panegyrist at the\nImperial court. Here he sent away his mistress to free the way for an\nadvantageous marriage (a behavior presumably common for young\ncareerists at that epoch). At Milan he underwent the influence of\nBishop Ambrose (339\u2013397), who taught him the allegorical method\nof Scriptural exegesis, and of some Neoplatonically inclined\nChristians who acquainted him with an understanding of Christianity\nthat was philosophically informed and, to Augustine, intellectually\nmore satisfactory than Manicheism, from which he had already begun to\ndistance himself. The ensuing period of uncertainty and\ndoubt\u2014depicted in the Confessiones as a crisis in the\nmedical sense\u2014ended in summer 386, when Augustine converted to\nascetic Christianity and gave up both his chair of rhetoric and his\nfurther career prospects. After a winter of philosophical leisure at\nthe rural estate of Cassiciacum near Milan, Augustine was baptized by\nAmbrose at Easter 387 and returned to Africa, accompanied by his son,\nsome friends and his mother, who died on the journey (Ostia, 388). In\n391 he was, apparently against his will, ordained a priest in the\ndiocese of the maritime city of Hippo Regius (modern Annaba/B\u00f4ne\nin Algeria). About five years later (ca. 396) he succeeded the local\nbishop. This ecclesiastical function involved new pastoral, political,\nadministrative and juridical duties, and his responsibility for and\nexperiences with an ordinary Christian congregation may have\ncontributed to modify his views on grace and original sin (Brown 2000:\nch. 15). But his rhetorical skills equipped him well for his daily\npreaching and for religious disputes. Throughout his life as a bishop\nhe was involved in religious controversies with Manicheans, Donatists,\nPelagians and, to a lesser extent, pagans. Most of the numerous books\nand letters he wrote in that period were part of these controversies\nor at least inspired by them, and even those that were not (e.g.,\nDe Genesi ad litteram, De trinitate) combine\nphilosophical or theological teaching with rhetorical persuasion\n(Tornau 2006a). Polemics against his former co-religionists, the\nManicheans, looms large in his work until about 400; the debate with\nthem helped to shape his ideas on the non-substantiality of evil and\non human responsibility. The Donatist schism had its roots in the last\ngreat persecution at the beginning of the fourth century. The\nDonatists saw themselves as the legitimate successors of those who had\nremained steadfast during the persecution and claimed to represent the\nAfrican tradition of a Christian \u201cchurch of the pure\u201d.\nSince 405 the Donatists were subsumed under the imperial laws against\nheresy and forced to re-enter the Catholic church by legal means;\nthese measures were intensified after a conference at Carthage (411)\nhad marked the official end of Donatism in Africa (Lancel &\nAlexander 1996\u20132002). By way of his assiduous writing against\nthe Donatists, Augustine sharpened his ecclesiological ideas and\ndeveloped a theory of religious coercion based on an intentionalist\nunderstanding of Christian love. Pelagianism (named after the British\nascetic Pelagius) was a movement Augustine became aware of around 412.\nHe and his African fellow-bishops managed to get it condemned as a\nheresy in 418. While not denying the importance of divine grace,\nPelagius and his followers insisted that the human being was by nature\nfree and able not to sin (possibilitas). Against this view,\nAugustine vigorously defended his doctrine of the human being\u2019s\nradical dependence on grace, a conviction already voiced in the\nConfessiones but refined and hardened during the controversy.\nThe last decade of Augustine\u2019s life is marked by a vitriolic\ndebate with the Pelagianist ex-bishop Julian of Aeclanum who accused\nAugustine of crypto-Manicheism and of denying free will while\nAugustine blamed him and the Pelagianists for evacuating\nChrist\u2019s sacrifice by denying original sin (Drecoll\n2012\u20132018). Controversy with pagan traditionalists seems to have\nreached a peak after 400, when Augustine refuted a series of\nobjections against Christianity apparently extracted from\nPorphyry\u2019s treatise Against the Christians\n(Letter 102; Bochet 2011), and after 410, when the city of\nRome had been sacked by Alaric and his Goths. The City of\nGod, Augustine\u2019s great apology, was prompted by this\nsymbolic event, though it is by no means just a response to pagan\npolemics.\n Augustine\u2019s life ended when the Vandals besieged Hippo; he is\nsaid to have died with a word of Plotinus on his lips (Possidius,\nVita Augustini 28.11, after Plotinus, Enneads I\n4.7.23\u201324).\n",
