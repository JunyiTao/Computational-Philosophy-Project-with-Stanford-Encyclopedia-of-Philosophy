Areas of overlap\n\nThe debates about logic and about ontology overlap at various places.\nGiven the division of ontology into (O1)\u2013(O4), and the division\nof logic into (L1)\u2013(L4) we can consider several issues where\nlogic, understood a certain way, overlaps with ontology, understood a\ncertain way. In the following we will discuss some paradigmatic\ndebates related to the relationship between logic and ontology,\norganized by areas of overlap.\n",
