    "main_text": "Meritocratic Governance || Restricted suffrage\n3.2 Restricted suffrage\n\nA natural meritocratic approach is to limit political power to\ncitizens who are sufficiently competent. American women did not secure\na right to vote until 1920, with the passage of the Nineteenth\nAmendment to the Constitution. John Adams explains his reasoning\nwhy:\n\n\nTheir delicacy renders them unfit for practice and experience in the\ngreat businesses of life, and the hardy enterprises of war, as well as\nthe arduous cares of state. (1776)\n\n\nUnsurprisingly\u2014given its history\u2014restricted suffrage has\nfound little philosophical purchase. But it\u2019s worth remembering\nthat we continue to deprive classes of people of political power\nwithout outcry. Children, for example, cannot vote. In Adams\u2019\nwords, they \u201chave not judgment or Will of their own\u201d.\n(L\u00f3pez-Guerra [2014] argues for a full expansion of the\nsuffrage, to include children.)\n\nJason Brennan (2011) is the salient exception to philosophers\u2019\nresistance to restricted suffrage. He argues that citizens have a\nright \u201cnot to be subject to high stakes decisions made by\nincompetent and morally unreasonable people\u201d (2011: 702), and\nthat this right is violated under universal suffrage.\n\nBrennan analogizes electorates to juries: We would think a\ndefendant\u2019s rights had been violated if he were convicted by an\nignorant, irrational, or morally unreasonable jury. And since\nreal-world electorates are, according to Brennan, ignorant,\nirrational, and morally unreasonable, those affected by their\ndecisions find their rights violated.\n\nBrennan\u2019s argument is distinctive not only because it defends\nrestricted suffrage but because it gives a deontological\njustification for political meritocracy. The other justifications\nsurveyed in this section are consequentialist. While such a\njustification for restricted suffrage might be given, Brennan\u2019s\nconcern is the alleged rights-violations that universal suffrage\ninflicts.\n",
