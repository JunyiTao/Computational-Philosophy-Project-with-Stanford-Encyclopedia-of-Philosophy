    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Distinctions among Types of Indexicals\n1.3 Distinctions among Types of Indexicals\n\n\nVarious theorists classify indexicals into types, depending\n(roughly) on how their references and contents are determined in a\ncontext. Kaplan (1989a), for instance, distinguishes between pure\nindexicals and true demonstratives. The pure indexicals,\nhe says, include \u2018I\u2019, \u2018today\u2019,\n\u2018tomorrow\u2019, \u2018actual\u2019, \u2018present\u2019,\n\u2018here\u2019, and \u2018now\u2019. The true demonstratives\ninclude \u2018he\u2019, \u2018she\u2019, \u2018his\u2019,\n\u2018her\u2019, and \u2018that\u2019. Kaplan claims that the\nreference and content of a true demonstrative, in a context, depends\n(roughly) on the speaker\u2019s accompanying demonstrations or\nintentions. For example, Kaplan says that the reference and content of\n\u2018that\u2019 in a context is determined (in part) by the\nspeaker\u2019s pointing gestures or by the speaker\u2019s intention\nto refer to a particular object. The reference and content of a pure\nindexical does not. For example, the reference of \u2018I\u2019 in a\ncontext is always the speaker, whether or not she points at herself,\nand the reference of \u2018tomorrow\u2019 is always the day after the\nday of the context, no matter which day the speaker intends to refer\nto.\n\n\nJohn Perry (1997; 2001, pp. 58\u201362) makes a closely related\ndistinction between automatic and discretionary\nindexicals. Automatic indexicals include \u2018I\u2019 and\n\u2018tomorrow\u2019; Perry says they are indexicals whose references\nare determined by their linguistic meanings and public\ncontextual facts, such as the speaker and the day of utterance;\nintentions (other than the intention to use the indexical with its\nusual meaning) are irrelevant. Discretionary indexicals include\n\u2018he\u2019, \u2018she\u2019, \u2018that\u2019, and\n\u2018this man\u2019; they depend for reference on speakers\u2019\nintentions. Perry also makes an orthogonal distinction between\nnarrow and wide indexicals. Narrow indexicals are\nthose whose references are determined by narrow contexts,\nwhere narrow contexts include only a speaker, a time, and a location.\nWide contexts include other facts, such as speakers\u2019 intentions,\nassumptions made by conversational participants, and so on. The\nexpressions that Kaplan calls \u2018true demonstratives\u2019 Perry\nwould call \u2018wide discretionary indexicals\u2019.\n\n\nVarious complications arise in categorizing indexicals as pure\nindexicals and true demonstratives, or as automatic and discretionary.\nKaplan (1989) classifies \u2018here\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019 as\npure indexicals, though he thinks that the temporal and spatial extents\nof their extensions depend on speakers\u2019 intentions (Kaplan 1989a,\n419, n.12). Perry (1997, 2001) thinks that this sort of variation\njustifies classifying them as discretionary rather than automatic.\nOther indexicals may raise similar issues. For example,\n\u2018today\u2019 may initially appear to be an automatic indexical\nin Perry\u2019s sense, but sometimes it is seemingly used to refer to\ntemporal periods longer than a single day, as in \u2018Today we ride\nin automobiles rather than in horse-drawn carriages\u2019. For further\ndiscussion of these distinctions, and their viability, see Mount\n(2008).\n",
