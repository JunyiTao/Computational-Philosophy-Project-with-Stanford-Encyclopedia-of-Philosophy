    "main_text": "Religion\n8. Religion\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 religious beliefs play a central part in their\nthought, providing a foundation for their view that an objective\nmoral code obtains in the cosmos and thus perhaps much of the\nmotivation for their way of life. Though brief, their descriptions of\ntheir beliefs and practices provide a rare direct glimpse into the\nreligion of one portion of the sub-elite populace of ancient China.\n\n\nLike much traditional Chinese religious thought, Mohist beliefs are in\neffect an extension of the social and political system to incorporate\nrelations with a personified conception of nature and various\nsentient, intelligent entities with whom humans share the natural\nworld. The Zhou dynasty nature deity Tian (Heaven, nature,\nthe sky) is the counterpart (and superior) in this extended system of\nthe human sovereign. Other elements include the Shang dynasty high\ngod di and a variety of ghosts and spirits, from those of\ndeceased human ancestors to those of natural, geographical features\nsuch as mountains and rivers. The various beings that constitute this\npersonified natural setting enforce morality by rewarding the worthy\nand punishing the wicked.  Humans view them as objects of respect,\ngratitude, and fear, sacrificing animals and offering millet and wine\nto feed and placate them and to seek their blessings.\n\n\nAt the pinnacle of the cosmic sociopolitical hierarchy stands Tian.\nTian created humans, set the sun, moon, and stars on their\nregular paths through the sky, fashioned the landscape, and\nestablished the four seasons and weather so that crops could grow. It\nprovides people with the sustenance and natural resources by which\nthey live. It established government to watch over people and\nadminister rewards and punishments. All people are its subjects and\nowe it veneration and gratitude for its many gifts. It reigns\nvirtuously over the human emperor \u2014 the \u201cSon of\nTian\u201d \u2014 as a kind of cosmic sovereign and all-seeing,\nall-powerful policeman. As the highest, noblest, and wisest moral\nagent, it embodies correct moral norms and thus serves as a role model\nby which to judge the morality of practices and actions.\n\n\nIt is often convenient to translate Tian as \u201cHeaven,\u201d a word\nthat similarly refers to both the sky and a deity. Yet Tian\nis dissimilar from the Judeo-Christian conception of God or Heaven in\nseveral ways. Tian does not exist outside of time, space, or\nnature, nor is it considered perfect or unchanging. It is not the\ncreator of nature, but rather is nature, or part\nthereof. (Combined with \u2018di\u2019 (earth), the word\n\u2018tian\u2019 forms the compound\n\u2018tian-di\u2019 (sky-and-earth), which refers to the\nnatural world.) Tian is personified as a sociopolitical\nauthority, but it is considerably less anthropomorphic than the\nJudeo-Christian God. It has desires and intentions, and it speaks, but\nonly as if thinking to itself, not directly to humans. Tian\ngenerally does not inform humans of its desires or intentions by\nrevelation (though in crises it may dispatch a spirit envoy, such as a\nfantastic talking bird). Rather, we must discern them for ourselves by\nobserving its behavior. Humans sacrifice to Tian, but usually\ndo not pray to it or address it directly. However, we do have an\nimplicit agreement with\nTian that if we conform to its desires, it will reward us in\nturn. Specifically, care for and benefit to others will be rewarded,\ncontempt and injury punished.\n\n\nThe Mohists have no concept of religious salvation or of another realm\nto which we go after death. (Tian is of course not a\ntranscendent place or realm but an embodiment of nature.) When people die,\nthey become ghosts, which exist within the natural world. Unlike in\nChristianity, people are not rewarded or punished in the next world\nfor their deeds in this one. Rather, the Mohists insist that\nTian and the ghosts will reward and punish people while they\nare alive. As one might expect, this belief was strongly challenged by\nthe Mohists\u2019 opponents, who pointed out instances in which it is at\nodds with everyday experience. Unfortunately, the Mohist responses to\nthese criticisms in the end amount mainly to ad hoc excuses.\n\n\nDespite the genuine tone of reverence in the Mohists\u2019 descriptions of\nTian, some readers find Mohist religion to lack the sense of\nholiness, religious awe, and spiritual transcendence that contemporary\nWesterners customarily associate with religion, particularly in\ncontrast with Confucian appreciation of the beauty of ritual or Daoist\nwonder at the mysteries of nature. The mundane tone of their religious\nthought is perhaps partly due to the Mohists\u2019 general disregard of\naesthetic and cultural value. Yet it would be indefensibly parochial\nto expect them to conform to a modern Westerner\u2019s conception of\nreligiosity, since the comparatively mundane character of Mohist\nreligion is typical of much traditional Chinese folk religion. In\nfact, the Mohists are deeply dedicated to maintaining harmonious,\nreverential relations with Tian, ancestral ghosts, and nature\nspirits, and both their rhetoric and practices devote much energy to\nreligious veneration. \n",
