    "main_text": "Writings\n2. Writings\n\n\nMost of Buridan's works are in the form of commentaries on\nAristotle. He wrote both expositiones (expositions), or\nliteral commentaries consisting of detailed, line-by-line explanations\nof the meaning of Aristotle's words, and quaestiones\n(questions), or longer, critical studies of the philosophical issues\nraised by them, usually centered on a specific lemma from the text.\nBoth genres originated in the classroom, a fact which becomes clear in\noccasional references to student queries and student concerns which survive in\nthe written versions. Like teachers in our own day, Buridan\nlectured more than once on the same text over the course of his career,\nwith the result that there are sometimes different versions of his\ncommentary on the same work. For example, there are three versions of\nhis Quaestiones on Aristotle's De anima, the last of\nwhich identifies itself as the \u201cthird or final lecture\n[tertia sive ultima lectura]\u201d. Where there are multiple\nversions of the same commentary, their relationship is generally one\nof increasing length and sophistication over time.\n\n\nBuridan commented on virtually all of the major works of Aristotle.\nIn addition to the entire Organon, there are commentaries on\nAristotle's Physics, On the Heavens, On\nGeneration and Corruption, De Anima, Parva\nNaturalia, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, and\n Rhetoric.[6]\n He also wrote a number of shorter, independent treatises on\nphilosophical topics that were controversial in his day, such as the Tractatus de\nrelationibus [Treatise on Relations], Tractatus de\nuniversalibus [Treatise on Universals], Tractatus de\nconsequentiis [Treatise on Consequences], and Quaestio de\npuncto [Question on <the Nature of> Points].  He was a very prolific author.\n\n\nBut Buridan's masterwork is the Summulae de dialectica\n[Compendium of Dialectic], a comprehensive logic textbook which started\nout as a commentary on the Summulae logicales or logical\ncompendium of the thirteenth-century dialectician, Peter of\n Spain,[7]\n but soon evolved into an independent work of astonishing breadth and\noriginality. In it, Buridan redeems the older medieval tradition of\nAristotelian logic through the via moderna [modern\nway]\u2014i.e., the newer, terminist logic that had gradually\nreplaced it. Because the work was accessible to master and student\nalike, it became extremely popular at Paris and in newly-founded\nuniversities such as Heidelberg, Prague, and Vienna.\n\n\nBuridan's other works were almost as widely read as the\nSummulae. Handwritten copies and early printed editions were\ncarried by his students and followers throughout Europe, where they\nwere often used as primary texts in university courses on logic and\nAristotelian philosophy, meaning that arts masters would teach\nAristotle by reading and explaining Buridan's commentary to the class.\nAs a result, the via Buridani continued to shape European\nthought well into the Renaissance.\n\n\nLike other medieval philosophers, Buridan's thought has not been fully\nappreciated because of the lack of modern editions and translations of\nhis work (see bibliography). But the situation\nbegan to improve with the appearance in 2001 of Gyula Klima's mammoth\ntranslation of the entire Summulae from the (now complete)\nLatin critical edition of this text. More recently, an edition of\nBuridan's commentary On Generation and Corruption has\nappeared (Streijger, Bakker, & Thijssen 2010), along with editions\nof the first four books of his commentary on the Physics\n(ed. Streijger & Bakker, 2015, 2016), as well as of his very\ninteresting commentary on pseudo-Albertus-Magnus' treatise De\nsecretis mulierum [On the Secrets of Women] (ed. Beneduce 2017).\nWe also now have a reliable English translation of his groundbreaking\nTreatise on Consequences (tr. Read 2015). An edition and\ntranslation of Buridan's influential commentary on De Anima\nis virtually complete (ed. Hartman, Sobol, & Zupko, with tr. by\nHartman, Klima, & Zupko, forthcoming in 2018).  Other editions are\nin progress, but knowledge of Latin and the ability to read medieval\nmanuscripts remain essential if one wishes to study Buridan's thought\nfirst-hand.\n",
