    "main_text": "Stage one: emergence || Regional continuities and discontinuities\n4.2 Regional continuities and discontinuities\n\nScholars routinely distinguish three broad regional approaches to\nAfricana philosophy, one for the continent of Africa and two for the\nregions where the vast majority of participants in the diaspora\nreside: the Caribbean and the Americas. These regions are not just\ngeographically distinct but also have importantly different histories\nand constellations of cultures, not least because of the internal\ncomplexities that complicate region-wide generalizations. In addition,\nthese different regions occupy different places in global networks for\nmainstream knowledge production, which gives them different, and\ndifferently weighted, opportunities for publishing and scholarly\nexchange. In light of these conditions, it is not surprising that the\noccupants of each region often find themselves taking up distinctive\nquestions and problems, and pursuing them using modes of philosophical\nreflection and generic touchstones\u2014specific texts and\nfigures\u2014that are to some degree regionally specific.\n\nRegional specificity notwithstanding, the condition of Africanaity\nmeans in part that important thematic continuities stretch across the\nregions. Some concern the role of violence in anti-racist struggle,\nthe meaning of African roots for people in the diaspora, and the\ntensions between race-based, class-based, and gender-based approaches\nto social justice that call forth talk of intersectionality and\nrelated concepts. Others are importantly rooted in the overarching\nthemes noted above, with special emphasis on decolonization,\nanti-slavery agitation, and anti-imperial struggle.\n\nDespite these continuities, concerns that distinguish the regions are\nnot far to seek. For example, Gordon (2008) reasonably suggests that\nthe question of the modern might be one of Africana philosophy\u2019s\nunifying themes. But each region tends to adopt its own approach.\nAfrican thinkers often explore the relationship between modernity and\ntradition, sometimes linking the prospects for liberation to the\nprospects for modernizing Africa, while at other times complicating\nthe easy distinction between the traditional and the modern and the\neasy conflation of modernization with civilization and of both with\nEurope. Afro-Caribbean thinkers, by contrast, tend to be less\ninterested in a distant \u201ctraditional\u201d world than in the\nworld that resulted from the collision of forced migrants, indigenous\npeoples, and settler colonists. This approach eventuates in, among\nmuch else, Edouard Glissant\u2019s (1989) studies of\ncreolit\u00e9. In the Americas, finally, different\ndemographic conditions and historical trajectories led many (but of\ncourse not all) prominent figures to turn the question of tradition\ninto debates about racial uplift and racial integration.\n",
