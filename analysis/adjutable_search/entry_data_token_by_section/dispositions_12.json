    "main_text": "Dispositions and Categorical Bases || The Relation between Dispositions and Their Bases\n4.2 The Relation between Dispositions and Their Bases\n\nViews about the relation between dispositions and their causal bases\nmirror views about the relation between mental and physical\nproperties. Armstrong, Martin & Place (1996) and Mackie (1973,\n1977) defend a \u2018type-identity theory\u2019 according to which\nany disposition is identical with its causal basis. Mumford (1998)\ndefends a \u2018token-identity theory\u2019 according to which any\ninstance of a disposition is identical with an instance of its causal\nbasis. Prior\u2014together with Pargetter and Jackson\u2014defends a\n\u2018functionalist theory\u2019 according to which a disposition is\na second-order property of having some causal basis or other. There\nare other views too, but we will confine discussion here to the three\nmentioned above.\n\nArmstrong (Armstrong, Martin & Place 1996, chapter 3) puts forward\none argument for the identity of dispositions with their causal bases\nthat basically goes as follows: since dispositions are by definition\nproperties that play certain causal roles, and since in fact their\ncausal bases are what play those roles, it follows that dispositions\nare in fact identical with their causal bases. Armstrong claims that\nhis identification of dispositions with their causal bases is a\n\u2018contingent identification\u2019 (Armstrong et al. 1996, p. 39): As a matter of fact the property that\nplays the brittleness role is such-and-such, but it might have been a\ndifferent property that played that role; if so, brittleness would\nhave been identical with that different property. This feature of\nArmstrong\u2019s view exposes it to Prior et al.\u2019s (1982) argument from\nrigid designation. Following Kripke, Prior et al. take names of\nproperties to be \u2018rigid designators\u2019, referring to the\nsame property in every possible world (in which that property exists).\nAs Kripke (1972) demonstrates,\nif \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are rigid designators\nthen the identity\nstatement \\(a = b\\) is necessarily true\nif it is true at all. So on the assumption that, for example,\n\u2018brittleness\u2019 and \u2018microstructural property\nso-and-so\u2019 are rigid designators, the possibility that the\ncausal basis for brittleness might have been something other than\nmicrostructural property so-and-so shows that brittleness is not\nidentical with microstructural property so-and-so. (See McKitrick\n2003b for a reply to this argument. For additional arguments against\nArmstrong\u2019s view, see Prior et al. 1982 and Prior 1985; for\ndiscussions on them, see Mumford 1998, chapter 5 and McKitrick\n2003b.)\n\nOpposing the identity of dispositions with their causal bases, Prior\net al. present arguments for what they call the \u2018Distinctness\nThesis\u2019. One of them is the argument from rigid designation,\nwhich we have just discussed. Another springs from the possibility of\nmultiple realization of dispositions. Different fragile objects, for\nexample, have different causal bases\u2014some are fragile in virtue\nof their irregular atomic structure, some are fragile in virtue of\ntheir weak intermolecular bonding. This seems to serve as evidence for\nthe Distinctness Thesis. Why? If dispositions were identified with\ntheir causal bases, we will end up having to say that diverse causal\nbases of fragility are identical to each other. But they\nare, ex hypothesi, distinct from each other. And so\nPrior et al. argue that the multiple realizability of dispositions\nprovides a reductio basis for the Distinctness\nThesis.\n\nMumford (1998, chapter 7) endorses this argument when it is construed\nas an argument against the \u2018type-type\u2019 identification of\ndispositions with their bases that Armstrong defends. But Mumford\ntakes a strategy familiar from the philosophy of mind and maintains\nthat Prior et al.\u2019s argument does not defeat his own\n\u2018token-token\u2019 identification. According to Mumford,\nalthough in general dispositions are not identical with their bases,\neach instance of a disposition is identical with an\ninstance of its causal basis. Anticipating Mumford\u2019s\nresponse, Prior (1985) complains that it is not at all clear what can\nbe meant by \u2018property instance\u2019 if, as Mumford maintains,\nan object\u2019s instance of property \\(A\\) can be the very\nsame thing as its instance of property \\(B\\), even though\nproperty \\(A\\) is not the same as\nproperty \\(B\\). Even if we grant the intelligibility of such\na notion of property instance, however, might not the very same\nargument from rigid designation show that instances of dispositions\ncannot be identical with instances of their bases, any more than\ndispositions themselves can be identical with their bases? Such would\nseem to be the appropriate lesson to draw from the fact that Kripke\u2019s\noriginal version of the argument, aimed against identity theories in\nphilosophy of mind, applies as much to token-token as to type-type\nversions of the identity theory. Mumford disagrees (p. 157), although\nhe says little to substantiate his disagreement. (See Rives 2005 for\nanother objection to Mumford.)\n\nIn the preceding paragraphs, we have canvassed Prior et al.\u2019s\narguments for their Distinctness Thesis. Using these arguments as a\nstepping stone, Prior (1985, chapter 7) and Jackson (1998) advance the\nfunctionalist view that disposition \\(D\\) is a\nsecond-order property, the property of having some first-order\nproperty or other that plays the causal role corresponding\nto \\(D\\). It seems to be a consequence of this view that\ndispositions do no causal work (see\n section 6\n below). For if having, say, the property of fragility is a matter of\nhaving a first-order property that plays the causal role\nassociated with fragility, then it would seem that it is this\nfirst-order property, not the second-order property, that does all\ncausal work. It would seem, then, that the functionalist view is open\nto the objection that it predicts dispositions to be \u2018causally\nsuperfluous\u2019 in a way that, intuitively, they are not. (See\nMumford 1998; Martin & Heil 1999; Heil 2003, 2005 for this\nobjection, and see\n section 6\n below for further discussion.)\n",
