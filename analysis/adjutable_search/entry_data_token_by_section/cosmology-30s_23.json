    "main_text": "Dingle\u2019s Denoument || The Coolest Voice\n6.6 The Coolest Voice\n\nThe clearest, most temperate description of the issues at hand is\ngiven by young cosmologist William McCrea, then professor of\nmathematics at Queen\u2019s, Belfast, and editor of the\nR.A.S.\u2019s Observatory. Not to be outdone by Jeffreys,\nMcCrea begins with an ad hominem of his own: \u201cDr. H.\nDingle\u2019s objection to \u2018modern Aristotelianism\u2019 seems\nto be itself what he would call Aristotelian rather than\nGalilean.\u201d In other words, Dingle raises a non-empirical\nobjection about Milne et al.\u2019s non-empiricism! But\nMcCrea soon gets to the heart of the matter, the role of\nhypothetico-deductivism in mathematical physics:\n\nWhat Dr. Dingle has done is to reopen the question of the relation of\nmathematical physics to experimental physics, since he claims to\ndetect a new and perverted point of view in the former. Now a system\nof mathematical physics, apart from the alleged perversion, is the\nworking out of the mathematical consequences of certain hypotheses.\nThe worth of the theory is judged\u2026by the closeness of the\nagreement of its predictions with the results of observation, and also\nthe number of phenomena which it can so predict from the one set of\nhypotheses. The scientific attitude is, not to cavil at the attempt,\nbut to see if it is successful.\n\n\nThis is an absolutely standard interpretation of how the H-D method\nworks. Throughout his own writings, beginning right from his inaugural\nlecture in Oxford (Milne 1929), Milne had subscribed to precisely the\nsame interpretation of the Hypothetico-Deductive (H-D) method.\nWhatever the controversy is about, the issue is not how to interpret\nhypothetico-deductivism. That much is evident.\n\nMoreover, it is quite clear that Dingle et al. are not\nmounting opposition to something we, today, would consider\nphilosophically radical; rather, they are objecting to what, today,\nwould be considered completely unobjectionable. Given today\u2019s\nacceptance of the H-D method, yet its rejection by otherwise\nwell-regarded scientists at that time, it seems to follow that it was,\nat least in part, this debate and its followup which settled the\nissue. In any case, Dingle and his supporters generally went silent,\nrestricting their activities for the most part to books, or relatively\npositive statements of their own positions (A.D.R. 1938, Dingle 1938).\nThings settled down, just in time for the War.\n",
