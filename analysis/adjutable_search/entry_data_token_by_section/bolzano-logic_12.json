Consequence and other semantic relations are\nthen defined in terms of the behaviour of formulas when arbitrary\nsemantic values of the appropriate kinds are assigned to all of the\nnon-logical parameters (usually including a tacit parameter for the\ndomain of quantification). On this view, consequence is a dyadic\nrelation between a set of premises and a conclusion or set of\nconclusions.\n\nBecause non-logical parameters are never held constant, many\ninferences can only be declared valid if they are interpreted as\nenthymematic, requiring supplementation in the form of\n\u201ctacit\u201d premises. For example, \\(e \\lt \\pi\\) cannot be\nsaid to follow from \\(e \\lt 3\\) and \\(3 \\lt \\pi\\) because there are\nmodels of \\(aRb\\) and \\(bRc\\) that are not models of \\(aRc\\). Adding\n\\(\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z ((Rxy \\wedge Ryz) \\rightarrow Rxz)\\)\nto the premises, however, we obtain a valid argument form.\n\nBy contrast, Bolzano\u2019s deducibility is a relation between\npropositions in themselves and variable ideas. It does not rely on a\nstrict classification of ideas as either logical or non-logical (as we\nsaw, Bolzano had doubts about whether such a line could be drawn).\nIndeed, it is not a notion of logical consequence at all, but rather a\nmore general notion of which logical consequence is a special case.\nDeducibility is a triadic relation involving collections of\npremises, conclusions, and variable ideas.\n\nThus, for example, [\\(e \\lt \\pi\\)] is deducible from [\\(e \\lt 3\\)] and\n[\\(3 \\lt \\pi\\)] with respect to the variable ideas [\\(e\\)], [3], and,\n[\\(\\pi\\)]. In agreement with contemporary logic, this conclusion is\nnot deducible from the premises if [\\(\\lt\\)] is added to the variable\nideas, but it is deducible with respect to those variables if we add\nthe allegedly tacit premise. An additional noteworthy feature of\nBolzano\u2019s approach is that the allegedly unstated premise is\nequivalent to the claim that a relation of deducibility holds with\nrespect to the ideas [\\(e\\)], [3], and, [\\(\\pi\\)] (George, 1983).\n\nThe individuation of arguments, on Bolzano\u2019s view, involves not\nonly a specification of premises and conclusions(s) but also of an\ninference. Usually, inferences embody repeatable patterns or forms.\nAnd we determine the form-matter distinction (and thus what the\ninference is) in each particular case by specifying which ideas are to\nbe considered variable:\n\n\nIn every inference there are variable ideas with respect to which the\ndeducibility of the conclusion from the premises is stated. \u2026\nthe matter of the inference consist[s] precisely in these variable\nideas, while the form consists in what is common to all inferences\nwhich differ merely with respect to their matter (TS,\n\u00a7254 [II.516\u20137]). \n\n\nLimiting our interpretations of arguments to the inferential forms\nafforded by formal languages in which there are only logical constants\nthus precludes us from representing the forms of many arguments, in\nmuch the same way that the design of the IBM 360 ruled out file names\nwith more than eight characters (cf. van Benthem, 2013).\n\nAs with analyticity, deducibility can obtain for all sorts of reasons,\nnecessary or contingent, logical or non-logical, known or unknown.\n[Not all birds fly], for instance, is deducible from [Some birds\ndon\u2019t fly] with respect to [birds] and [fly], and [Buddy is a\nbird] is deducible from [Buddy is a crow] with respect to [Buddy],\nwhile [Harry Truman wasn\u2019t a Buddhist] is also deducible from\n[Harry Truman was a 20th-century US president] with respect to [Harry\nTruman]. The last example shows that deducibility does not require\nthat the connection between premises and conclusion be necessary, nor\nthat it be knowable a priori (though, unsurprisingly, Bolzano\nheld that there are cases of deducibility that are necessary, some of\nwhich are also knowable a priori). There is thus a clean\nisolation of truth-preservation as a phenomenon of intrinsic logical\ninterest. \n\nIn some cases, a deduction contains idle elements. For example, in an\nargument of the form \u2018All \\(A\\) are \\(C\\), All \\(B\\) are \\(C\\),\nAll \\(C\\) are \\(D\\), therefore All \\(A\\) are \\(D\\)\u2019, the second\npremise can be omitted without destroying the relation of\ndeducibility. Similarly in an argument of the form \u2018Anything\nthat is either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is \\(C\\), All \\(C\\) are \\(D\\), therefore\nAll \\(A\\) are \\(D\\)\u2019, we could get by with a simpler premise of\nthe form \u2018Anything that is \\(A\\) is \\(C\\)\u2019 instead of the\nfirst premise. Seeing this, Bolzano sought a narrower notion that\nwould filter out redundant or trivial inferences.\n\nIn TS, \u00a7 155, no. 26, he introduces the concept of\nexact deducibility: \\(M\\) is exactly deducible from \\(A, B,\nC, \\ldots\\), we read there, just in case \\(M\\) is deducible from \\(A,\nB, C, \\ldots\\) but no relation of deducibility holds if any of the\npremises, or any of their parts, is omitted. A deduction that is not\nexact is called redundant. In the shorter version of his\nlogic (Bolzano 2004a: 54), the stipulation about omitting parts is\ndropped. This was probably wise, as the additional condition seems to\nhave some unwelcome consequences (cf. Rusnock and\n\u0160ebest\u00edk, 2019, 312\u20133).\n\nBolzano proves some significant theorems about the narrower relation: If\n\\(M\\) is exactly deducible from \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\), then none \\(A, B,\nC, \\ldots, M\\) is universally valid or universally invalid with\nrespect to the variables of the deduction. Furthermore, the negation\nof each premise is compatible with the remaining premises. Hence,\nsince compatibility is required for deducibility, each premise is\nindependent of the others with respect to the variables of the\ndeduction. In addition, it follows from a result proved by Rolf George\nthat when a relation of exact deducibility holds, at least one of the\nvariables must occur both within the premises and within the\nconclusion (George, 1983; cf. Rusnock and \u0160ebest\u00edk,\n2019, 314\u20135). Exact deducibility thus satisfies a condition of\nrelevance (Stelzner, 2002).\n\nAnother special case of deducibility is logical deducibility;\nit holds when all the invariable elements in a deduction are logical\nconcepts (TS, \u00a7 223). There are obvious parallels\nbetween this notion and Tarski\u2019s notion of logical consequence.\nMore intriguing, perhaps, are the similarities between Bolzano\u2019s\nlogical deducibility and a relation described by Frege in the course\nof his dispute with Hilbert and Korselt (Frege, 1906, 426ff), which\nare so striking that G\u00f6ran Sundholm suggested that Frege may have\nprofited from an unacknowledged acquaintance with Bolzano\u2019s\nlogic (Sundholm, 2000; but cf. K\u00fcnne, 2008, 330ff.). Another\nplausible explanation is that Frege simply reverse-engineered\nsomething quite like Bolzanian logical deducibility by making the\nlogical methodology of Hilbert\u2019s Foundations of\nGeometry explicit.\n\nBolzano\u2019s characterization of logical deducibility is\nsubstitutional, an approach examined only to be rejected by Tarski\nbecause it was liable to produce unsatisfactory results in cases where\n\u201cthe language we are dealing with does not possess a sufficient\nstock of extra-logical constants\u201d (Tarski 1936 [1983]: 415).\nBolzano did not face exactly the same problem, because his logic deals\nwith ideas in themselves and not with linguistic expressions. The\nstructural problem underlying Tarski\u2019s criticism also did not\noccur to him because he assumed that for every object there is an idea\nin itself that represents it exclusively, a thesis that is not\nconsistently tenable with his other free-wheeling ontological\nassumptions (the difficulties are discussed in detail by Simons (1987:\n42) and Siebel (1996: 216\u2013223)). Tarski, who did not make\nBolzano\u2019s assumption with respect to languages, stated his\ndefinitive formulation in terms of models, or the satisfaction of\nsentential functions by sequences of objects.\n",
