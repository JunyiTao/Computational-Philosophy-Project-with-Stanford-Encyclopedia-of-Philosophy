Character, Wellbeing, Emotion, and Moral Standing\n\nUntil the 1950s, modern moral philosophy had largely focused on either\nconsequentialism or deontology. The revitalization of virtue ethics\nled to a renewed interest in virtues and vices (e.g., honesty,\ngenerosity, fairness, dishonesty, stinginess, unfairness), in\neudaimonia (often translated as \u2018happiness\u2019 or\n\u2018flourishing\u2019), and in the emotions. In recent decades,\nexperimental work in psychology, sociology, and neuroscience has been\nbrought to bear on the empirical grounding of philosophical views in\nthese areas.\n",
