    "main_text": "\n\nClimate science investigates the structure and dynamics of\nearth\u2019s climate system. It seeks to understand how global,\nregional and local climates are maintained as well as the processes by\nwhich they change over time. In doing so, it employs observations and\ntheory from a variety of domains, including meteorology, oceanography,\nphysics, chemistry and more. These resources also inform the\ndevelopment of computer models of the climate system, which are a\nmainstay of climate research today. This entry provides an overview of\nsome of the core concepts and practices of contemporary climate\nscience as well as philosophical work that engages with them. The\nfocus is primarily on epistemological and methodological issues that\narise when producing climate datasets and when constructing, using and\nevaluating climate models. Some key questions and findings about\nanthropogenic climate change are also discussed. \n",
