    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe expression \u201ccontinental rationalism\u201d refers to a set\nof views more or less shared by a number of philosophers active on the\nEuropean continent during the latter two thirds of the seventeenth\ncentury and the beginning of the eighteenth. Rationalism is most often\ncharacterized as an epistemological position. On this view, to be a\nrationalist requires at least one of the following: (1) a privileging\nof reason and intuition over sensation and experience, (2) regarding\nall or most ideas as innate rather than adventitious, (3) an emphasis\non certain rather than merely probable knowledge as the goal of\nenquiry. While all of the continental rationalists meet one or more of\nthese criteria, this is arguably the consequence of a deeper tie that\nbinds them together\u2014that is, a metaphysical commitment to the\nreality of substance, and, in particular, to substance as an\nunderlying principle of unity.\n",
