    "main_text": "William of Ockham || Rights of the Community\n13.4 Rights of the Community\n\nAccording to the canon \u201cIus civile\u201d (D. 1 c. 8),\n\u201cCivil law is the law proper to itself that each people or city\nestablishes, for divine and human reason\u201d. Ockham took this as a\nstatement of a natural right belonging to each \u201cfree\u201d\ncommunity, i.e., one not already under government, to establish its\nown law and its own\n government.[73]\n This right exists by natural law in the third sense\n (\u00a76.1\n above), i.e. \u201con supposition\u201d, namely on the supposition\nthat the community needs law and government. This is true of every\ncommunity after the Fall. After the Fall natural law gave (or God\ngave) the human race the power to establish both property and\ngovernment; God gave these powers not only to believers but also to\nunbelievers. A particular community exercises the power to establish\ngovernment by choosing a ruler and a form of government; the\nruler\u2019s power therefore comes from God, but also \u201cfrom the\npeople\u201d, i.e. from the community. But although power comes to\nthe ruler by the community\u2019s agreement, disagreement is not\nenough to remove it: the ruler has a right to the power the community\nhas conferred as long as he exercises it properly, and he cannot\nnormally be corrected or removed. But in exceptional circumstances, if\nthe ruler becomes a tyrant, or if there is some other pressing reason\nin terms of the common good, the community can depose its ruler or\nchange its form of government (Breviloquium 6.2; trans.\nShort Discourse: 158\u201363; Octo questiones 3.3,\nin Letter, 310\u201311; Miethke 2004). This is true also of\nthe Church. Although Christ gave headship in the Church to Peter and\nhis successors, each Christian community has power by natural law to\nelect its own head. The Christian community can depose a wicked pope\nand could perhaps even change the constitution of the Church, at least\ntemporarily, from the papal monarchy Christ established to some other\nform\n (3.2 Dialogus 3. 6;\n 3.1 Dialogus 2.20\u201328; in Letter: 290\u20133, 171\u2013203).\n\nAccording to Paul, \u201cthere is no power but from God\u201d\n (Romans 13:1),\n and according to a gloss on a canon from the Decretum, the\nemperor\u2019s power is \u201cfrom God alone\u201d (D. 96 c. 11,\ns.v. \u201cdivinitus\u201d). Ockham quotes these texts, and says\nthat although the secular ruler\u2019s power is \u201cfrom the\npeople\u201d, yet it is also \u201cfrom God alone\u201d, and not\nonly indirectly (i.e., from God as ultimate cause) but directly,\n\u201cwithout intermediary\u201d. These propositions are not\nobviously reconcilable. In a work apparently not circulated during the\nmiddle ages, the Breviloquium, Ockham tries to reconcile\nthem: political power comes from God, but God confers it on the ruler\nselected the community; once rulership has been conferred, the ruler\nis subject to God alone\u2014regularly, though on occasion a\ncommunity can correct or depose its ruler (Breviloquium\n4.2\u20138; Short Discourse: 110\u201321;\nPotest\u00e0 1986).\n",
