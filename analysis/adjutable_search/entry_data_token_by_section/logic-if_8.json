    "main_text": "Philosophical Consequences\n5. Philosophical Consequences\n\nHintikka (2006a: 73\u201377) takes the following to be among\nconsequences of the novel insights made possible by (extended) IF\nfirst-order logic: reconstruction of normal mathematical reasoning on\nthe first-order level, a novel perspective on the notion of truth in\naxiomatic set theory, insights into the nature of negation, and the\nformulation of a self-applied truth-predicate. A related topic of\ngeneral interest is the phenomenon of informational independence in\nnatural languages. The ideas related to negation and definability of\ntruth have been discussed in Subsections 4.2 and 4.5,\nrespectively. Let us consider here the remaining issues.\n",
