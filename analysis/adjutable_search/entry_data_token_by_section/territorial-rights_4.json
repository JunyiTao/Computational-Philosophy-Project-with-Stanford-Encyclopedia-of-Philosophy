They\nboth assumed that natural laws, which can be rationally apprehended,\napply to all human beings, are invariable across time and space, and\nconstitute the fundamental bonds of human society. Both theorists made\nroom for conventional law but argued that these were constrained by\nthe precepts of what both referred to as \u2018right\nreason\u2019.\n\nWriting in a period of initial imperial expansion and discovery,\nGrotius in Mare Liberum (1609) defended the idea of common\nownership of resources. By the term \u2018common ownership\u2019,\nGrotius meant that God granted all humans a right (a liberty right) to\nuse objects or resources in the world to satisfy basic needs. In\nrelation to the ocean, Grotius argued that no state or common power\ncould claim exclusive dominion over it because the sea is not\nconfinable within fixed boundaries and also is not amenable to\ntransformation through human labor and so not an appropriate object of\nproperty rights. For these reasons, it should remain a relatively\nundisturbed commons; human beings would be free to travel on it and\nengage in mutual exchange, and to fish (the resources of the sea\nbeing, in his view, almost limitless). Although this view was\nchallenged in his own day by John Selden in Mare Clausum\n(1635), who pointed out that geographical coordinates could enclose\nthe sea, and in our own day by the recognition that the resources of\nthe ocean and the seabed are not limitless, the idea of international\nrights over a global commons was very influential in the creation of\nmodern international law, and was also important to the development of\nsea empires shortly thereafter (see Armitage 2012: 54\u201356). This\nidea is applied to many areas today as part of the idea of\n\u2018common heritage of mankind\u2019.\n\nIn relation to land Grotius argued that all individuals have a natural\nright to use objects that are held in common, but this right lacks\nsome of the incidents that we associate with ownership proper. There\nis no right to exclude or to have a thing when it was no longer in\none\u2019s possession. He then elaborates a genealogical argument,\naccording to which, in the early period of human existence, we lived\nin a simpler state where \u201cthe great extent of land was\nsufficient for the use of all occupants, as yet but few in number,\nwithout their incommoding each other\u201d (Grotius RWP: II,\n2, ii). However, as people became more ambitious and more acquisitive\nin meeting their needs, they began to interact more extensively with\nresources, and so came to possess moveable things and to cultivate and\noccupy immoveable resources, like land. As population increased in\nnumber and spread throughout the world, it didn\u2019t make sense to\nhave a common right in objects many miles distant from where people\nlive (Grotius RWP: II, 2, ii). Grotius appealed to the idea\nof consent, capaciously understood to include the gradual\nestablishment of rules of acquisition, use and transfer. He also\nargued that possession would be converted to jurisdiction through a\npublic act which allows all to recognize who possesses what, which is\nimportant to ensure peaceful possession and reconcile the division of\nthe world with human sociability. \n\nBecause Grotius conceives of natural rights (including our rights as\ncommon owners in things) as potentially transferable, he is able to\nexplain and defend different kinds of government\nsystems\u2014democracies, oligarchies, even absolute monarchies.\nSince, for Grotius, the natural rights that a person has over his or\nher own person are alienable, he is able to argue that the source of\nthe state\u2019s authority stems from the transferability of this\nright to a sovereign authority through consent, including conventions\ndeveloped over a long period of time, which represents an implicit\nexchange for a peaceful and stable society. He also argues that civil\nauthority can also be acquired through conquest (Grotius RWP:\nII.3.viii), although this aspect of his theory is not emphasized by\ncontemporary scholars.\n\nMost criticisms of Grotius\u2019 theory focus on his defense of\nabsolute sovereignty, but the focus here is on his account of\ngroup-based possession implicit in his justification for territory.\nThe central difficulty is that Grotius\u2019s account of possession\ndoes not have a scope limitation. It\u2019s not clear that he has the\nconceptual resources to establish limits to the area that a group can\nclaim (or possess). He did, however, recognize a right of necessity\nand other moral rights (to passage, settlement, commerce, use of\nwater, rights of refuge), which means that some sharing would be\nrequired by an appropriator. For their part, incomers would be\nrequired to submit to the sovereign (Grotius DJB II,2,\nxvii). This suggests that\nhe envisions state jurisdiction as encompassing large areas that are\nnot possessed or occupied in the normal sense, and some might argue\nthat it is counter-intuitive that a single group should be able to\nclaim sovereignty over vast tracts of land, as the European empires\ndid in the \u2018Age of Discovery\u2019, and require that all\npeoples and migrants simply submit to their rules. \n\nThe scope limitation for sovereignty authority is described more\nclearly in Pufendorf\u2019s natural law theory. Like Grotius, whose\npolitical philosophy he was attempting to defend, Pufendorf\n(DMC) believed in natural law and also laws derived in more\nconventional ways\u2014such as civil laws, or laws between nations.\nHe builds on Grotius\u2019 account in two ways. First, Pufendorf\nrightly pointed out that the ocean could be subject to the exercise of\njurisdiction. Second, and more significantly, his account provides the\nconceptual resources to recognize not only collective title, but it\nincorporates the idea of fair rules and fair terms in his account of\nthe establishment of property regimes. For Pufendorf, the state of\nnature was a state of social living, and our claims to resources of\nthe commons were rights held in a negative community in the sense that\nthe natural world was equally open to everyone, but that, in order to\nappropriate land or property, one needed the consent of other\nco-owners. Pufendorf did not specify what kind of consent ought to\ncount. However, he suggests that it would take the form of collective\nproperty or property held by communities, and that, from this,\nindividual claims could be derived. Cara Nine (2019) has argued that\nhis account has the conceptual resources to explain the limits of the\nstate\u2019s territorial domain in a non-arbitrary way, because he\nlimits both individual and collective title by invoking moral\nprinciples such as non-domination and need.\n",
