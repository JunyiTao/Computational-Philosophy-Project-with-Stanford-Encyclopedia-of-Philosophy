    "main_text": "What Makes Public Health, And Therefore Public Health Ethics, Distinctive? || Government Intervention\n1.2 Government Intervention\n\nThe second distinctive feature of public health with significant\nimplications for public health ethics is the large role that\ngovernment intervention and government power play in public health. So\nmuch of what is undertaken to advance public health requires the\napparatus and power of the state to be effective. Some go as far as to\nclaim that what makes public health \u2018public\u2019 is, at least\npartly, that public health is the business of the public, as\ncontrasted with private individuals. To these theorists, the\ndistinction between public and private health is not to be found\nmerely in the collective rather than the individual-level focus.\nInstead, who or what is promoting the health of the populace is\nrelevant (see Coggon 2012; Jennings 2007; Verweij and Dawson 2007;\nDawson and Verweij 2008). For instance, in The Future of Public Health,\nthe Institute of Medicine includes the following definition:\n\u201cPublic health is what we, as a society, do collectively to\nassure the conditions in which people can be healthy\u201d (Institute\nof Medicine 1988, p. 1, emphasis added). If we assume that in a\nfunctional democracy action by the government is action by us,\ncollectively, then we arrive at yet another way to understand the\nespecially close connection between government action and public\nhealth. If one goes further and claims that an action is a public\nhealth action only if it is taken by the collective and that an action\nis performed by us, collectively, only if it is performed by\ngovernment, then an intervention is a public health intervention only\nif a government is the relevant actor.\n\nThis conclusion will strike many in public health as unduly narrow,\nhowever. Private non-profit actors, especially charitable foundations\nand other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), frequently undertake\nmeasures that would be hard to characterize as anything other than\npublic health interventions in their character and in the outcomes\nthey\n secure.[3]\n For instance, vaccine research and development is often supported by\nNGOs, and vaccines are often delivered in epidemic contexts by NGOs.\nSimilarly, NGOs often mount health promotion campaigns and provide\nresources to communities to improve local public health\ninfrastructure. It seems contrived, at best, to conclude that because\nNGOs operate in the private sector, their activities do not constitute\nefforts to advance public health. Perhaps a more natural description\nis that NGOs as private entities undertake interventions to directly\nimprove public health without themselves being governmental public\nhealth entities (Coggon 2012). Of course, one could argue that NGOs\nlack the standing to engage in public health activities because they\nare not accountable to citizens and do not act in their name. This is\na legitimacy-based concern that has been levied against the\ndevelopment interventions of large-scale philanthropies generally.\n(Reich 2018) The core of the concern is that these large scale NGOs\nhave the power to set agendas and priorities in ways that sidestep or\nusurp what should otherwise be the prerogative of functional\nnation-states to determine. In other contexts, this concern may have\nlittle purchase, however. Consider, for example, when global NGOs\nundertake activities with the robust cooperation of or at the\ninvitation of the state, or in failed or otherwise problematic\nnational contexts that lack the resources or the will to protect the\nhealth of all or some of the populations that live within their\nborders. Also, global, pan-national organizations, most notably the\nWorld Health Organization, play a critical role in advancing public\nhealth. It would be bizarre to conclude that policies and guidance of\nthe WHO, or interventions that WHO leads, are not public health\npolicies or interventions because the WHO is not a state actor and\ndoes not have the enforcement or police powers of a state.\n\nAlthough collective action in the form of government intervention is\nthus not a necessary condition of public health, government\nintervention is still central to public health. Achieving good public\nhealth outcomes frequently requires extensive coordination on the part\nof many actors. To secure coordination, incentive structures for\nindividuals often need to be changed, and it is most often governments\nthat have the authority to make these changes. Because of this\nauthority, governments are especially well-suited to overcome\ncharacteristic challenges in promoting or realizing public health.\nConsider, for example, a paradigmatic challenge in deploying vaccines\nto combat infectious disease. If enough people are not willing to be\nvaccinated, then herd immunity is undermined. A central though\ncontested function of government is to disincentivize going\nunvaccinated by implementing policies that penalize those who refuse\nvaccination.\n\nThis point about governments being especially well-suited to changing\nthe incentive structure of individuals is significant for public\nhealth ethics insofar as many public health measures are coercive or\nare otherwise backed by the force of law. In this, as in all other\nareas of official state action, those concerned with the ethics of\npublic health have to address tensions among justice, security, and\nthe scope of legal restrictions and regulations. These tensions add to\nthe peculiarity of the justificatory questions surrounding public\nhealth: the exercise of public authority and the imposition of public\nsanctions and penalties in an area as deeply personal as an\nindividual\u2019s health choices require strong justification. The same\nquestions about trade-offs between personal freedom and collective\nbenefits that arise in the political arena generally thus also arise\nfor public health. It is in this context that concerns about the\nlegitimacy of public health interventions and paternalism typically\nemerge \u2013 concerns we return to in Section 3.\n",
