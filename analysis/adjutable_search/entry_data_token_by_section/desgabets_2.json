    "main_text": "Epistemology\n3. Epistemology\n\nThere is a long tradition of interpreting Desgabets as an empiricist\nfrom Victor Cousin (1852), and Francisque Bouillier (1868), to\nGenevieve Rodis-Lewis (1981, 1993), Patricia Easton and Thomas Lennon\n(1992), Tad Schmaltz (2002a; 2002b) and Sean Allen-Hermenson (2008).\nMonte Cook (2008) has raised an important challenge to the empiricist\nreading, questioning whether the senses provide any real content to\nour ideas. A discussion of some of the interpretive complexities\naround sensible qualities, the nature of ideas, the intentionality\nprinciple, and the method of truth follows below. Nonetheless, there\nis consensus that Desgabets rejected hyperbolic doubt, pure\nintellection and innate ideas, and insisted on the necessary role of\nthe senses in the formation of all ideas. Moreover, it is agreed that\nthese positions lean away from Descartes in varying degrees and\nconstitute a major if not radical revision of the Cartesian\nphilosophy.\n\nIn Desgabets\u2019s estimation, Descartes\u2019s truly great\ndiscovery was his identification of the true nature of sensible\nqualities (OPD 5, 164). The importance of this \u2018discovery\u2019\nin Desgabets\u2019s development of the Cartesian philosophy is\nparamount, since he believed that because of it, the way had been\nopened at last to lay the foundations of a true philosophy. Desgabets\ndrew out six important consequences (OPD 5, 165ff.), which he admits\nshows that \u201cDescartes is mistaken in what is the most\nfundamental in his method\u201d (OPD 5, 164). The six consequences\nare: (1) sensible qualities \u201c\u2026 are nothing else in\nobjects but the local dispositions of the small parts from which\nresult the sensations that we call heat, sound, light, etc.\u201d\n(OPD 2, 17); (2) sensible qualities are sentiments in the human soul\nthat have no resemblance to modes of matter, such as shape, size, and\nmotion; (3) external objects have the power to excite innumerable\nperceptions in us that we call sensations and ideas; (4) simple\nconceptions arise in us from objects outside us and are known truly,\nas they really exist; (5) knowing the true nature of sensible\nqualities as perceptions of the mind caused by bodies makes possible\nthe true physics; and, (6) by distinguishing the true nature of the\nbody from the sensible qualities it causes in us, we can unite physics\nwith the infallible sciences, for the solid of the geometer is the\nsame as the object of the physicist (extended matter). Each of these\nconsequences will be examined in more detail to investigate what was\nat the heart of Desgabets\u2019s adoption and revision of the\nCartesian philosophy.\n\n(1, 2, 3) Sensible qualities are states or modes of the human mind\nhaving only a causal relation to the specific local movements of our\nsensory organs, which in turn, are the effects of the local movements\nproduced by the corporeal qualities of matter. According to both\nDescartes and Desgabets, sensible qualities are nothing but\n\u201cvarious dispositions\u201d in objects to cause ideas in us.\nSince Descartes clearly held that sensible qualities are not the\nforms of material things but rather modes of the\nmind, the only sense in which sensible qualities could be\n\u201cin\u201d the various dispositions of objects is in the causal\nsense, that is, as their effects. While the status and nature of these\ndispositions in Descartes\u2019s account has been a subject of much\ndebate, he undeniably distinguishes between on the one hand, light,\ncolor, smell, taste, sound and touch (the so-called secondary\nqualities), and on the other hand, size, shape, and motion (the\nso-called primary qualities). Sensible qualities belong to the mind as\nmodes of perception, and primary qualities belong to body as modes of\nmatter. Desgabets follows suit by adopting the Cartesian distinction\nbetween minds and bodies, thereby attributing size, shape, and local\nmotions to body as modes of matter and sensible qualities such as\nheat, color, smells, sounds, pains and pleasures, and tangible\nqualities as modes of thinking things. Thus, sensible qualities\nqua modes of the mind have no resemblance or similarity to\nthe modes belonging to matter: \u201cthe sun is not luminous, the\nsnow is not white, the fire has no heat in the sense that we imagined\npreviously.\u201d (OPD 5, 165) However, Desgabets maintains that\nsensible qualities qua modes of mind do represent the soul\nand its relation to corporeal things, just as our ideas of\nbody and its modes when clearly perceived as shape, size, and local\nmotion, truly represent their object. How this is so brings us to the\nfourth consequence, that our simple conceptions arise in us from\nobjects outside us and are known as they actually exist.\n\n(4) Eclipsing the cogito as the first principle of knowledge\nin Desgabets\u2019s system is what has come to be known as the\n\u201cintentionality principle\u201d (Schmaltz, 2002; Hill, 2011;\nAdriaenssen, 2015). According to Desgabets by reflecting on the true\nnature of sensible qualities we are able to grasp the most general\nprinciple underlying all truths: that simple conception or the\nfirst operation of the mind is always true and conforms to its\nobject. As Desgabets describes this foundational principle:\n\u201c... that every idea has a real object; that nothing cannot be\nthought; that simple conception always conforms to its object; that to\nthink and to think of something are inseparable things, and as the\nnatural order would have it, we begin to philosophize by the\nexposition and development of this great principle ...\u201d (OPD5.\n178). If such a principle could be established, as Desgabets claims\nthat it can, it would mean that simple conception conforms to its\nobject, it preserves the truth, and hence provides the foundation for\nhuman knowledge. Most of Desgabets\u2019s discussion of the\nintentionality principle treats it as self-evidently true. If we\nreflect on the nature of human thought itself\u2014as by its nature\npresupposing an object\u2014then we see the absurdity of there being\na thought with no object. If we reflect on the existence of human\nknowledge itself then we see that it presupposes knowable\nthings\u2014for what is knowledge unless there are prior knowable\nthings? The intuition Desgabets seems to be working with is that\ngiven there is human thought and knowledge, there must\nbe objects of thought and objects known to make it possible. \n\nAlthough Desgabets gives a new meaning to the doctrine of simple\nconception, he and Descartes agree that simple conception is always\ntrue and conforms to its object, while error is a product of\nprecipitous judgment. This is a theme found in Descartes that depends\non the Cartesian distinction between the scope of the two basic\noperations of the mind\u2014that of the intellect and that of the\nwill. The functions of assenting and dissenting are performed by the\nwill, while those of perception and conception are performed by the\nsenses and intellect. Desgabets challenges Descartes\u2019s\n\u201cpretension\u201d that he could detach himself from all\ncommerce with the senses, which sets the rationalist tone of the\nMeditations. Of course, Descartes saw this detachment as\ndesirable because he thought it was in virtue of it that he could\navoid error and defend the certainty of human knowledge. Descartes\nalso argues that the soul is known more clearly than the body because\nwe, as thinking things, are intimately tied to the immaterial,\nthinking substance, which is our soul. The body, on the other hand, is\npart of material not immaterial substance, and so is not known\nimmediately. It is because of this that Descartes took the\ncogito to be the foundation of certainty in human knowledge,\nand our knowledge of body to be less clear and less immediate.\nHowever, according to Desgabets, this is where Descartes goes terribly\nastray. Had Descartes reflected more deeply on the nature of the\nmind-body union, he would have seen that our ideas of body and mind\nare equally clear, and equally evident. For, the soul of man is not an\nimmaterial substance, but is a result of the union of mind and body,\nand all our ideas, even of the soul, equally depend upon the operation\nof the senses. From here, it can be seen that there is a principle\nmore fundamental than the cogito, namely the principle of\nintentionality, that to think is to think of something.\nClarity and distinctness, according to Desgabets, tells us when we\nhave grasped something truthfully, but the intentionality of thought\ngrounds the truth of clarity and distinctness.\n\nBut how, according to Desgabets, are we to distinguish a simple\nconception from a precipitous judgment? In his\nSuppl\u00e9ment (OPD 6, 222) he offers the example of the\nheat of fire to illustrate the distinction: when someone approaches\nfire and has the sensation of heat he may be persuaded that the heat\nhe feels is in the fire just as he perceives it, since this sensation\nis known to him clearly. But, he has erred because of a tacit\njudgment. The judgment that the heat is in the fire entails that the\nheat as we perceive it resembles what is in the fire, which is false.\nFor, as Descartes discovered, the sensation of heat is a mode of the\nmind, not a mode of the fire (body). The fire we feel \u201c... is\nthe object of simple conception only when we do not conceive this heat\nas in the fire, rather as something that makes us have this feeling\nwhen we approach the fire. But if one says the heat of the fire\nresembles the sentiment that is our heat, a judgment is added to\nsimple perception and falls in error because the judgment extends\nbeyond the perception\u201d (OPD 6, 222). Likewise, when we judge\nthat a stick is straight or bent when half-submerged in water we judge\nprecipitously\u2014what is known is that it is equally real and\nconceivable that a stick (as a material body) is straight or curbed\n(is shaped) (Desgabets, 1675, 67\u201368). Thus, simple conception\ngrasps its object clearly and represents the thing perceived as it\nreally is. When we perceive the heat of the fire simpliciter,\nwe perceive the sensation of heat as a sensation of the mind; when we\nperceive the fire simpliciter, we perceive it as a corporeal\nbody having extension and local configurations and motions. Simple\nconceptions are the mind\u2019s grasp of things as they are in\nthemselves, which is to say, in relation to their essence and modes as\nextended substances, or as thinking minds: \u201cWe therefore have\nonly to think of extended substance which is matter, of its movements,\nof its figures, of the situations of its parts, of angels, of souls,\nof men and their operations, to be very sure that all this exists. For\nwhether thought represents to us substance or accident, body or\nspirit, it is equally necessary that all of these exist outside of\nthought, unless one thinks without thinking of anything, and the first\noperation of the mind ceases to conform to its object\u201d\n(Desgabets, 1675, 124). A related error made by Descartes, according\nto Desgabets, is to allow chimeras and other such beings of reason\namong the number of objects of simple conception. Such a mistake\nobscured Descartes from discovering the true foundation of human\ncertainty, the basic truth that the first operation of the mind has\nonly real things for its object. By including chimerical\nbeings among the objects of simple conception, Descartes opened the\ndoor to the possibility of thoughts without true objects. But,\njudgment or the extension of the will beyond the domain of what is\nconceived is the true source of chimerical beings of reason and hence\nof all error (OPD 4, 103).\n\n(5 & 6) Desgabets drew two more final consequences from\nDescartes\u2019s discovery of the true nature of sensible qualities.\nIn order to make physics a true science, Desgabets must accomplish two\nthings: first, show that the senses are necessary for the knowledge of\nphysical objects and; secondly, show that physics is founded in\ninfallible sciences (mathematics and geometry). The fifth consequence\nthus aims to establish that perceptions of the mind are caused by\nbodies and makes possible the true physics. In Part 1, chapter three\nof the Suppl\u00e9ment, Desgabets explicitly examines\nDescartes\u2019s rejection of the empiricist motto, that all\nknowledge comes from the senses. While Desgabets rejects the\nScholastic rendering of the motto, he is equally critical of\nDescartes\u2019s precipitous rejection of it. According to Desgabets,\nthe proper sense of the empiricist motto is that all thoughts\noriginate by the senses [a sensu] rather than in the\nsenses [in sensu], and what reaches the intellect is not what\nis found in the senses. As Lennon nicely puts it, \u201cFor him\nthings are directly perceived and an idea is the means by which, and\nnot in which, a thing is perceived\u201d (Lennon, 1998, 353). The\nsoul must always be in commerce with the senses by the nature of the\nmind-body union, and although our thoughts depend on the corporeal\ntraces in the brain for their source or origin, it does not follow\nthat our ideas must be corporeal, or even similar to corporeal things.\nThe very fact that all of our thoughts have a beginning, duration,\ncessation, and succession proves that they depend on motion, and\nmotion is only communicated through the senses. This is why he\nmodifies the empiricist motto from: nihil est in intellectu quin\nprius fuerit in sensu, to a sensu.\n\nWhile this formulation of the empiricist motto goes against the notion\nof pure intellection, it leaves open the question of whether the\nsenses play more than an occasional role in the occurrence of all\nthoughts, including about body. According to Desgabets, it is\nundeniable that man is a being who reasons, draws consequences, does\nnot see things indivisibly, who has thoughts in succession which\nbegin, continue, and finish, and who often experiences doubt and\nconjecture. Such doubting, discursive reasoning and succession of\nthought prove that all thought is tied to the body since duration and\nsuccessive extension are nothing but the local movements of the body\n(OPD 7, 299). A pure thought, the kind that Descartes (and Malebranche\nafter him) envisioned for metaphysical reasoning, would have no\nbeginning, duration, end, or succession. In short, such a thought\nwould be indivisible, and hence unthinkable by the human mind. Both\nDescartes and Malebranche rejected the empiricist thesis because they\nerroneously thought that it would commit them to the materialist\nthesis that thoughts and the soul are material. This led them to adopt\nthe intellectualist thesis regarding the mind\u2019s perception of\nmetaphysical essences. However, Desgabets saw a third option, one\nwhich is founded on the mind-body union and the sensory basis of all\nknowledge, and one which founds the full and proper sense of the\nempiricist motto, that all ideas originate by the senses. Since\nmovement is a mode belonging to body, many tended to conclude that if\nminds depend on movement, then minds must have something corporeal in\nthem. How could it be that our thoughts, which have something\ncorporeal in them, namely, movement, are not themselves corporeal? And\nyet, this is exactly what Desgabets argued. He believed that thoughts\nhave something corporeal in their being without themselves being\ncorporeal\u2014in the same way that every object in our thought has a\nbeginning, continuation, and end without these objects having duration\nin themselves. While things really have duration, it is only\nextrinsically and by thought, \u201cthe same way a pole is\ndivided into ten feet when one imagines the ten feet\u201d (OPD 7:\n299). \n\nAt first glance, Desgabets\u2019s analogy between attributing a\ncorporeal nature to thoughts and attributing a duration or division to\nthings serves more to confuse than clarify. But if we draw on his\naccount of the true nature of individual bodies, we can make some\nsense of it. Individual bodies are real in that they result from\nactual divisions of matter, assemblages of local dispositions of parts\nof matter. Bodies then act upon our sensory organs which in turn are\nreceived as ideas in the mind. But the individuation of\nperception into sensible ideas of bodies is essentially an\noperation performed by the mind, even though it has its foundation in\nthe local dispositions of matter itself. For example, our perception\nof a ten-foot pole is the effect of a specific assemblage of local\ndispositions of matter acting upon our sensory organs at a certain\ntime and the mind\u2019s division of that sensible body into\nten feet. The local disposition itself is not intrinsically a pole, or\nten feet long, but it is so extrinsically, that is, by thought.\nSimilarly, thoughts themselves are not intrinsically extended or\nsubject to movement, but they are so extrinsically, that is, as an\neffect of the operations of the sensory organs of the body. In other\nwords, just as the local movements of matter individuate thought\nextrinsically giving the mind individual thoughts, the thought of\nimmaterial substance individuates matter extrinsically thereby giving\nit perceptions of individual bodies. The mind-body union, and the\nessential intentionality which results from it, create the mutual\ndependence of the operations of mind and matter without requiring that\nmind be material or matter be immaterial.\n\nThis does not mean that the senses cannot access the true nature of\nthings. In fact, for Desgabets, since all knowledge comes from the\nsenses, the function of knowing the essences of things is a necessary\nrole served by the senses. Recall that the true nature of particular\nobjects consists in the local dispositions of parts of matter which\nproduce the course of the movements we experience. Think of these\nsensible objects as akin to Humean bundles of perceptions except that\nfor Desgabets there is a causal relation to the object of our idea\nthat ensures a conformity of the perceived object and the object.\nThese movements are the first and sole contact we have with the\nmaterial world, and so the senses present, in some form, not only the\nexistence of a given object, but also the value of that object in\nrelation to our survival. We only reach knowledge of the true nature\nof material objects by considering their being in relation to their\nsubstance. In order to achieve this, we must abstract from all\nrelations of time, and only then see it as it is in itself. What the\nsenses provide us is knowledge of matter in its various divisions,\nshapes, sizes, etc., that is, as matter in its parts as it exists at a\ncertain time and place. Thus, what Desgabets seemed to have assumed\nwas that the reason we so often err with regard to the true nature of\nthese bodies and their movements is that we judge precipitously, or\ntoo quickly, before the mind has had a chance to conceive of material\nsubstance as it is in itself, independent of any temporal or spatial\nties. Thus, it seems that Desgabets holds that the senses provide us\nwith the materials necessary not just for the occasioning of thoughts\nof bodies but also for the knowledge of their essence. \n\nThe sixth consequence bears directly on our ability to see the right\npath to a true and certain physics. The true physics is one that\nrecognizes that \u201ceverything that happens in matter by the\ndifferent movements and modes of its parts, belongs to mathematics and\nmechanics, which have all of this for their object\u201d (OPD 5,\n166). The object of the true physics is not the substantial forms of\nthe Scholastics, but rather, matter whose essence is extension, and\nits modes which are nothing else but various divisions and movements\nof its parts. As Desgabets puts this, the natural object of the\nphysicists is the same as the solid of the mathematician. The solid of\nmathematicians, according to Desgabets, consists in a magnitude that\nhas three dimensions, i.e., length, width, and breadth while the\nnatural body of the physicist consists in a substance extended in\nthree dimensions. This is the crowning statement of Desgabets\u2019s\nmetaphysical view that the physical world is really a single\nobject or substance whose parts, under various divisions, shapes and\narrangements, form all the appearances in the \u201cgrand\ntheater of nature\u201d (OPD 5, 166). Once physics is united with the\ninfallible sciences of mathematics and mechanics, the path to the true\nscience of physics is secure.\n\nHaving surveyed the six consequences of the true nature of sensible\nqualities we can see the heart of Desgabets\u2019s revision of\nCartesianism: that in order to use reason properly we must recognize\nthat all our ideas or simple conceptions have a real object outside of\nit, which is in itself what is represented by thought, and which\nactually contains the degree of being that one sees there. The work of\nthe search after truth is to avoid precipitous judgment and keep to\nthe simple conception of things. If body is extended in three\ndimensions capable of modes of size, shape and motion, and individual\nbodies are modal beings in the sense claimed by Desgabets, then there\nis no cleavage between object and object known because they are one\nand the same thing. Corporeal things cause sensible ideas in us that\nrepresent modes of the mind and cause ideas of bodies, shapes, sizes,\nand motions that represent matter. What is represented to our thought\nthrough simple conception is the real object of knowledge, namely,\nmaterial and spiritual substance. What we sense directly are these\nsubstances as they exist in time, or in other words, as they exist at\na given time by thought in virtue of the particular local\ndispositions of matter.\n",
