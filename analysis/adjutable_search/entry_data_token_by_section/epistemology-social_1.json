Giving Shape to the Field of Social Epistemology\n\nAlong these lines, an approach somewhat analogous to social\nepistemology was developed in the middle part of the 20th century.\nPrimarily sociological in nature, this movement focused on how science\nis actually practiced, often aiming to debunk what theorists saw as\nthe \u201cidealized\u201d accounts of science in orthodox\nepistemology and in mid-century philosophy of science. Members of what\ncame to be known as the \u201cStrong Program\u201d in the sociology\nof science, such as Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1986), challenged\nthe notion of objective truth, arguing that so-called\n\u201cfacts\u201d are not discovered by science but rather are\n\u201cconstructed,\u201d \u201cconstituted,\u201d or\n\u201cfabricated.\u201d Another proponent of the Strong Program,\nDavid Bloor, advocated for the \u201csymmetry thesis,\u201d\naccording to which scientists\u2019 beliefs are to be explained by\nsocial factors, regardless of whether these beliefs are true or false,\nrational or irrational (Bloor 1991: 7). This view denies the\nexplanatory relevance of such things as facts and evidence.\n\nViews like the Strong Program found additional support in certain\nparts of philosophy (especially among those embracing\ndeconstructionism). Michel Foucault, for example, developed a\nradically political view of knowledge and science, arguing that\npractices of so-called knowledge-seeking are driven by quests for\npower and social domination (1969 [1972], 1975 [1977]). Richard Rorty\n(1979) rejected the traditional conception of knowledge as\n\u201caccuracy of representation\u201d and sought to replace it with\na notion of the \u201csocial justification of belief.\u201d Other\nphilosophers ascribed a central explanatory role to social factors but\nwere less extreme in their critique of objectivity in science. Most\nsignificant among these was Thomas Kuhn, who had been trained as a\nphysicist but who moved post-PhD into the history and philosophy of\nscience. Kuhn held that purely objective considerations could never\nsettle disputes between competing theories, underscoring the social\nfactors that influence the development of scientific theory (Kuhn\n1962/1970). Debates about these topics persisted under the heading of\n\u201cthe science wars.\u201d\n\nEven for those philosophers who repudiate these sorts of skeptical and\ndebunking positions, there are important lessons from the debates such\npositions inspired. Above all, the key lesson concerns the importance\nof social factors in cognition, including the role of cultural beliefs\nand the biases that operate in the pursuit of knowledge. It is in this\ncontext that what we might call the dominant strand of social\nepistemology emerged.\n\nDeparting sharply from the debunking themes sketched above,\ncontemporary social epistemology aims to acknowledge and account for\nthe variety of social factors that figure centrally in the pursuit of\ntruth, without surrendering the very notions of truth and falsity,\nknowledge and error. Theorists in this tradition often defend\nproposals that are continuous with traditional epistemology. While\nthey continue to acknowledge that there are identifiable cases in\nwhich social factors or social interactions pose threats to truth\nacquisition (see below), they also contend that the right kinds of\nsocial organization and social norms enhance the prospects of\nacquiring truth.\n\nThe seminal defense for this sort of approach to social epistemology\nis Alvin Goldman (1999). This book, whose influence on contemporary\nsocial epistemology is hard to overstate, developed Goldman\u2019s\n\u201cveritistic\u201d approach, which focuses on the reliability\nwith which various social practices produce true beliefs (Goldman\n1999: 5). While Goldman (1999) presented a framework for research in\nsocial epistemology, work on relevant topics had already begun to\nflourish. Testimony emerged as a central topic for social epistemology\nowing to works such as Elizabeth Fricker (1987), Edward Craig (1990),\nand C.A.J. Coady (1992). Philosophy of science, too, eventually became\nan important site of contemporary social epistemology; seminal work\nincludes Philip Kitcher (1990, 1993), Helen Longino (1990, 2002), and\nMiriam Solomon (2007). Margaret Gilbert (1989) made a forceful case\nfor the existence of \u201cplural subjects,\u201d thereby providing\nthe metaphysical foundations for the social epistemology of\ncollectives. And, under the influence of Cristina Bicchieri (2005),\nsocial epistemologists began to take stock of the importance of social\nnorms in social epistemological analysis (see e.g. Henderson and\nGraham (2019) and Sanford Goldberg (2018, 2021).\n\nThe salience of social epistemology has also been enhanced by journals\ndevoted in whole or in part to the topic. In 1988, Steve Fuller\ncreated the journal Social Epistemology, whose original focus\nwas on social studies of science and on science and technology\nstudies. Some years later Alvin Goldman, inspired by the desire for a\nsocial epistemology journal that engaged more with\n\u201cmainstream\u201d epistemology, started Episteme: A Journal\nof Individual and Social Epistemology in 2004. (While it\noriginally focused exclusively on social epistemology, it has since\nexpanded its scope to include individual epistemology.)\n",
