    "main_text": "William of Ockham || Papal Power Limited\n13.2 Papal Power Limited\n\nSoon Ockham began to write about the conflict between John and the\nRoman Empire, and, like Marsilius, he saw the papal claim to fullness\nof power as the root of many\n evils.[68]\n Unlike Marsilius, however, he did not reject the idea of papal\nfullness of power in every sense. Against Marsilius (whom he quotes\nextensively on this\n topic),[69]\n Ockham defended the traditional belief that Christ appointed Peter as\nhead of the Church, and he held that the pope, as Peter\u2019s\nsuccessor, has supreme power in the Church. The pope and other clergy\nmust not become involved in secular affairs, regularly, but in\nexceptional circumstances, Ockham says, when no lay person is able or\nwilling to take the lead in some matter necessary to the welfare of\nthe Christian community, the pope may intervene in secular matters.\nThis is an application of Aristotle\u2019s notion of\nepieikeia (see\n \u00a77).\n The pope\u2019s regular power in religious matters and occasional\npower to intervene in secular matters justify the traditional\nascription to the pope of fullness of power. However, this fullness of\npower is not omnipotence. Not only must the pope respect the moral law\nand the teachings of the Church, but he must also respect rights based\non human law and compact, and he must respect the Gospel liberty of\n Christians.[70]\n A pope who oversteps these bounds may be deposed; indeed, if his\naction involves heresy, he is deposed ipso facto\u2014and\naccording to Ockham, Popes John XXII and Benedict XII were\n heretics.[71]\n\n",
