    "main_text": "The Role of Introspection in Scientific Psychology || The Re-Emergence of Scientific Introspection\n3.4 The Re-Emergence of Scientific Introspection\n\nIn no period, however, were introspective methods entirely\nabandoned by psychologists, and in the last few decades, they have\nmade something of a comeback, especially with the rise of the\ninterdisciplinary field of \u201cconsciousness studies\u201d (see,\ne.g., Jack and Roepstorff, eds., 2003, 2004). Ericsson and Simon\n(1984/1993; to be discussed further in Section 4.2.3 below) have\nadvocated the use of \u201cthink-aloud protocols\u201d and\nimmediately retrospective reports in the study of problem solving.\nOther researchers have emphasized introspective methods in the study\nof imagery (Marks 1985; Kosslyn, Reisbert, and Behrmann 2006) and\nemotion (Lambie and Marcel 2002; Barrett et al. 2007).\n\nBeeper methodologies have been developed to facilitate immediate\nretrospection, especially by Hurlburt (1990, 2011; Hurlburt and Heavey\n2006; Hurlburt and Schwitzgebel 2007) and Csikszentmihalyi (Larson and\nCsikszentmihalyi 1983; Csikszentmihalyi 2014). Traditional immediately\nretrospective methods required the introspective observer in the\nlaboratory somehow to intentionally refrain from introspecting the\ntarget experience as it occurs, arguably a difficult task. Hurlburt\nand Csikszentmihalyi, in contrast, give participants beepers to wear\nduring ordinary, everyday activity. The beepers are timed to sound\nonly at long intervals, surprising participants and triggering an\nimmediately retrospective assessment of their \u201cinner\nexperience\u201d, emotion, or thoughts in the moment before the\nbeep.\n\nIntrospective or subjective reports of conscious experience have also\nplayed an important role in the search for the \u201cneural\ncorrelates of consciousness\u201d (as reviewed in Rees and Frith\n2007; Prinz 2012; Koch et al. 2016; see also Varela 1996). One\nparadigm is for researchers to present ambiguous sensory stimuli,\nholding them constant over an extended period, noting what neural\nchanges correlate with changes in subjective reports of experience.\nFor example, in \u201cbinocular rivalry\u201d methods, two different\nimages (e.g., a face and a house) are presented, one to each eye.\nParticipants typically say that only one image is visible at a time,\nwith the visible image switching every few seconds. Researchers have\nsometimes reported finding evidence that activity in\n\u201cearly\u201d visual areas (such as V1) is not temporally\ncoupled with reported changes in visual experience, while changes in\nconscious percept are better temporally coupled with activity in\nparietal and maybe also frontal areas further downstream and to\nlarge-scale changes in neural synchronization or oscillation; however,\nthe evidence is disputed (Lumer, Friston, and Rees 1998; Tong et al.\n1998; Tononi et al. 1998; Polonsky et al. 2000; Tong, Meng, and Blake\n2006; Kamphuisen, Bauer, and van Ee 2008; Sandberg et al. 2013;\nFr\u00e4ssle et al. 2014; Ishiku and Zeki 2014; Tsuchiya et al. 2015).\nAnother version of the ambiguous sensory stimuli paradigm involves\npresenting the participant with an ambiguous figure such as the Rubin\nfaces-vase figure:\n\n\n\n\nUsing this paradigm, researchers have found neuronal changes both in\nearly visual areas and in later areas, as well as changes in\nwidespread neuronal synchrony, that correspond temporally with\nsubjective reports of flipping between one way and another of seeing\nthe ambiguous figure (Kleinschmidt et al. 1998; Rodriguez et al. 1999;\nIlg et al. 2008; Parkkonen et al. 2008; de Graaf et al. 2011; Megumi,\nBahrami, Kanai, and Rees 2015; Brascamp, Sterzer, Blake, and Knapen\n2017). In masking paradigms, stimuli are briefly presented then\nfollowed by a \u201cmask\u201d. On some trials, participants report\nseeing the stimuli, while on others they don\u2019t. In trials in\nwhich the participant reports that stimulus was visually experienced,\nresearchers have tended to find higher levels of activity through at\nleast some of the downstream visual pathways as well as spontaneous\nelectrical oscillations near 40 Hz (Dehaene et al. 2001; Summerfield,\nJack, and Burgess 2002; Del Cul, Baillet, and Dehaene 2007; Quiroga et\nal. 2008; Salti et al. 2015). However, it remains contentious how\nproperly to interpret such attempts to find neural correlates of\nconsciousness (No\u00eb and Thompson 2004; Overgaard, Sandberg, and\nJensen 2008; Dehaene and Changeux 2011; Aru, Bachmann, Singer, and\nMelloni 2012; de Graaf, Hsieh, and Sack 2012; Koch et al. 2016;\nPhillips 2018).\n\nIf we report our attitudes by introspecting upon them, then much of\nsurvey research is also introspective, though psychologists have not\ngenerally explicitly described it as such. As with subjective vs.\nobjective methods in psychophysics, there appears to be only a slight\ndifference between subjectively phrased questions (\u201cDo you\napprove of the President\u2019s handling of the war?\u201d,\n\u201cDo you think marijuana should be legalized?\u201d) and\nobjectively phrased questions (\u201cHas the President handled the\nwar well?\u201d, \u201cShould marijuana be legalized?\u201d). This\nwould seem to support the observation at the core of transparency\ntheory (discussed in Section 2.3.4 above) that questions about the\nmind and questions about the outside world often call for the same\ntype of reflection.\n",
