Support for EC: Apparently Inconsistent Knowledge Claims, Skeptical and Everyday\nAs its proponents generally admit, EC is something that one needs to be argued into: it takes work to come to think, for example, that there can be situations in which we have two subjects, exactly alike psychologically, possessing the very same history and the same evidence with regard to p, etc., with respect to only one of whom \u2018S knows that p\u2019 expresses a truth: we seem, if anything, to be intuitive Invariantists.[5] As one leading contextualist says, many resist the contextualist thesis, and \u201cthose who do accept [it] generally do so only as a result of being convinced by philosophical reflection\u201d (Cohen 1999, 78).\nBut while EC strikes many as quite contentious, according to its proponents it has considerable merits. For although EC is not itself a substantive epistemological theory, it has been said to afford a resolution of certain apparent epistemological puzzles. More specifically, EC is said to give us a way of responding to certain cases in which we have apparently inconsistent \u201cknowledge\u201d claims, each of which enjoys some plausibility. Though these puzzles are not exclusively of the skeptical variety, it is EC\u2019s offering a solution to skeptical problems that has figured most prominently in discussions. So that is the natural place to start.\n",
