Issues of Analysis and Definition\n\nMore than most policy areas dealt with by political philosophers, the\ndiscussion of property is beset with definitional difficulties. The\nfirst issue is to distinguish between property and private\nproperty.\n\nStrictly speaking, \u2018property\u2019 is a general term for the\nrules that govern people\u2019s access to and control of things like land,\nnatural resources, the means of production, manufactured goods, and\nalso (on some accounts) texts, ideas, inventions, and other\nintellectual products. Disagreements about their use are likely to be\nserious because resource-use matters to people. They are particularly\nserious where the objects in question are both scarce and necessary.\nSome have suggested that property relations only make sense under\nconditions of scarcity (Hume [1739] 1888, pp. 484\u201398). But other\ngrounds of conflict are possible: there may be disagreements about how\na given piece of land should be used, which stem from the history or\nsymbolic significance of that piece of land, whether land in\ngeneral is scarce or not. (Intellectual property provides an example\nof property rules that do not respond directly to scarcity; moreover\nunlike material objects, the objects of intellectual property are not\ncrowdable, for their use by any one person does not preclude their use\nby any number of\n others.)[1]\n\nAny society with an interest in avoiding conflict needs such a system\nof rules. Their importance can hardly be overestimated, for without\nthem cooperation, production, and exchange are virtually impossible,\nor possible only in the fearful and truncated forms we see in\n\u2018black markets.\u2019 This necessity is sometimes cited as an\nargument in favor of private property (Benn and Peters 1959,\np. 155). In fact, all it establishes is that there ought to be\nproperty rules of some kind: private property rules are one\nvariety. Some human societies have existed for millennia, satisfying\nthe needs and wants of all their members, without private property or\nanything like it in land or the other major resources of economic\nlife. So the first step in sound argumentation about property is\ndistinguishing those arguments which support the existence of property\nin general from arguments which support the existence of a system of a\nspecific kind (Waldron 1988).\n\nThere are three species of property arrangement: common property,\ncollective property, and private property. In a common\nproperty system, resources are governed by rules whose point is\nto make them available for use by all or any members of the society. A\ntract of common land, for example, may be used by everyone in a\ncommunity for grazing cattle or gathering food. A park may be open to\nall for picnics, sports or recreation. The aim of any restrictions on\nuse is simply to secure fair access for all and to prevent anyone from\nusing the common resource in a way that would preclude its use by\nothers. Collective property is a different idea: here the\ncommunity as a whole determines how important resources are to be\nused. These determinations are made on the basis of the social\ninterest through mechanisms of collective\ndecision-making\u2014anything from a leisurely debate among the\nelders of a tribe to the forming and implementing of a Soviet-style\n\u2018Five-Year Plan\u2019.\n\nPrivate property is an alternative to both collective and\ncommon property. In a private property system, property rules are\norganized around the idea that various contested resources are\nassigned to the decisional authority of particular individuals (or\nfamilies or firms). Thomas Merrill (2012) calls this \u2018the\nproperty strategy\u2019 and contrasts it with bureaucratic governance\nor the management of resources through group consensus. In a system of\nprivate property, the person to whom a given object is assigned\n(e.g., the person who found it or made it) has control over the\nobject: it is for her to decide what should be done with it. In\nexercising this authority, she is not understood to be acting as an\nagent or official of the society. She may act on her own initiative\nwithout giving anyone else an explanation, or she may enter into\ncooperative arrangements with others, just as she likes. She may even\ntransfer this right of decision to someone else, in which case that\nperson acquires the same rights she had. In general the right of a\nproprietor to decide as she pleases about the resource that she owns\napplies whether or not others are affected by her decision. If\nJennifer owns a steel factory, it is for her to decide (in\nher own interest) whether to close it or to keep the plant operating,\neven though a decision to close may have the gravest impact on her\nemployees and on the prosperity of the local community.\n\nThough private property is a system of individual decision-making, it\nis still a system of social rules. The owner is not required to rely\non her own strength to vindicate her right to make self-interested\ndecisions about the object assigned to her: if Jennifer\u2019s employees\noccupy the steel factory to keep it operating despite her wishes, she\ncan call the police and have them evicted; she does not have to do\nthis herself or even pay for it herself. So private property is\ncontinually in need of public justification\u2014first, because it\nempowers individuals to make decisions about the use of scarce\nresource in a way that is not necessarily sensitive to others\u2019 needs\nor the public good; and second, because it does not merely permit that\nbut deploys public force at public expense to uphold it.\n\nIt may be thought that the justificatory issue is nowadays moot, with\nthe collapse of socialist systems in Eastern Europe and the former\nSoviet Union, and the triumph of market economies all over the world.\nIt is tempting to conclude that since economic collectivism has been\nthoroughly discredited, the problem of justifying private\nproperty has been solved by default: there is simply no alternative.\nBut the point of discussing the justification of an institution is not\nonly to defend it against its competitors. Often we justify in order to\nunderstand and also to operate the institution intelligently. In\nthinking about property, there are a number of issues that make little\nsense unless debated with an awareness of what the point of\nprivate property might be. Some of these issues are\ntechnical. Consider, for example, the rule against perpetuities, the\nregistration of land titles, or the limits on testamentary freedom;\nall these would be like an arcane and unintelligible code, to be\nlearned at best by rote, unless we connect them with the point of\nthrowing social authority behind individual control (or behind the\nindividual disposition of control) over material resources. (See\nAckerman 1977, p. 116.)\n\nThe same is true of some grander issues. The Fifth Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution requires that private property not be taken for\npublic use without compensation. Clearly this prohibits the simple\nseizure of someone\u2019s land for use, say, as a firing range or an\nairport. But what if the state places a restriction on the use of a\nperson\u2019s land, telling the owner that she may not erect a modern\nskyscraper because it will compromise the historical aesthetics of the\nneighborhood? Does this amount to a taking? Certainly the owner has\nsuffered a loss (she may have bought the land with the intention of\ndeveloping it). On the other hand, we should not pretend that there is\na taking whenever any restriction is imposed: I may not drive my car\nat 100 m.p.h. but I am still the owner of the car. Such questions\ncannot be answered intelligently without revisiting the reasons (if\nany) that there are for giving private property this sort of\nconstitutional protection. Is it protected because we distrust the\nstate\u2019s ability to make intelligent decisions about resource use? Or\nis it protected because we want to place limits on the burdens that\nany individual may be expected to bear for the sake of the public\ngood? Our sense of the ultimate values that private ownership is\nsupposed to serve may make a considerable difference to our\ninterpretation of the takings clause and other doctrines.\n\nPlainly private property and collective control are not all-or-nothing\nalternatives. In every modern society, some resources are governed by\ncommon property rules (e.g., streets and parks), some are governed by\ncollective property rules (e.g., military bases and artillery pieces),\nand some are governed by private property rules (toothbrushes and\nbicycles). Also, there are variations in the degree of freedom that a\nprivate owner has over the resources assigned to him. Obviously, an\nowner\u2019s freedom is limited by background rules of conduct: I may not\nuse my gun to kill another person. These are not strictly property\nrules. More to the point are things like zoning restrictions, which\namount in effect to the imposition of a collective decision about\ncertain aspects of the use of a given resource. The owner of a\nbuilding in an historic district may be told, for example, that she\ncan use it as a shop, a home, or a hotel but she may not knock it down\nand replace it with a skyscraper. In this case, we may still say that\nthe historic building counts as private property; but if too many\nother areas of decision about its use were also controlled by public\nagencies, we would be more inclined to say that it was really subject\nto a collective property rule (with the \u2018owner\u2019\nfunctioning as steward of society\u2019s decisions).\n\nIt is probably a mistake therefore to insist on any definition of\nprivate property that implies a proprietor has absolute control over\nhis\n resource.[2]\n Some jurists have even argued that the terms \u2018property\u2019\nand \u2018ownership\u2019 should be eliminated from the technical\ndiscourse of the law (see Grey 1980). They say that calling someone\nthe \u2018owner\u2019 of a resource conveys no exact information\nabout her rights in relation to that resource: a corporate owner is\nnot the same as an individual owner; the owner of intellectual\nproperty has a different array of rights than the owner of an\nautomobile; and even with regard to one and the same resource, the\nrights (and duties) of a landlord who owes nothing on his property\nmight be quite different from those of a mortgagor.\n\nThe eliminative proposal makes sense to this extent: the position of a\nprivate owner is best understood not as a single right to the\nexclusive use and control of the object in question, but as a bundle\nof rights, which may vary from case to case (Honore 1961).\n\nIn recent literature, the \u2018bundle of rights\u2019 conception\nhas encountered resistance. Some theorists want to insist that\nproperty is better conceived, as it is in colloquial usage, as a\nsubstantial relation between a person and a thing (Penner 2000 and\nSmith 2012). This can be put forward on analytic grounds or for\nideological reasons; on the latter approach it is said that the\nimportance of property for a free society is obscured when the\nownership relation is treated as a divisible bundle of rights (Attas\n2006).\n\nTheorists who persevere with the \u2018bundle of rights\u2019\nanalysis nevertheless present some sticks in the bundle as more\nimportant than others: the right to exclude is usually seen as the key\nto ownership, even if it is one among many other rights and legal\nrelations that property comprises. It is the aspect of ownership that\nhas the greatest impact on others (Waldron 1993). Other\ntheorists are more skeptical about this. Katz 2008 and Dagan 2011\nsuggest that in our analysis of private property we should place less\nemphasis on the right to exclude and more on the owner\u2019s power\nof agenda-setting so far as the use of a given resource is concerned.\nOn any account, \u2018exclusive use\u2019 is a complex idea. Its\nimplications vary from context to context and from object to object:\nwe actually have a plurality of property arrangements, striking\ndifferent balances between owners\u2019 and others\u2019 interests\n(Dagan 2013). In its most abstract terms, the right to exclude\nimplies, first, that the owner is at liberty to use the object as he\npleases (within a range of generally acceptable uses) without\ninterference from others. Secondly, it implies that others have\nan obligation to refrain from using the object without the owner\u2019s\npermission. The point about permission implies in turn that the owner\nhas the power to license others to use her property. She may lend her\nautomobile, rent her house, or grant a right of way over her land. The\neffect of this may be to create other property interests in the\nobject, so that the various liberties, rights and powers of ownership\nare divided among several individuals.\n\nMore strikingly, the owner is legally empowered to transfer the whole\nbundle of rights in the object she owns to somebody else\u2014as a\ngift or by sale or as a legacy after death. With this power, a private\nproperty system becomes self-perpetuating. After an initial assignment\nof objects to owners, there is no further need for the community or\nthe state to concern itself with distributive questions. Objects will\ncirculate as the whims and decisions of individual owners and their\nsuccessive transferees dictate. The result may be that wealth is\nwidely distributed or it may be that wealth is concentrated in a very\nfew hands. It is part of the logic of private property that no-one has\nthe responsibility to concern themselves with the big picture, so far\nas the distribution of resources is concerned. Society simply pledges\nitself to enforce the rights of exclusion that ownership involves\nwherever those rights happen to be. Any concern about the balance\nbetween rich and poor must be brought in as a separate matter of\npublic policy (as tax and welfare policy or in extremis large\nscale redistribution). As we shall see, philosophers disagree as to\nwhether this is an advantage or an indictment of private property\nsystems.\n\nAt the furthest reaches of analysis, the concept of private property\nbecomes quite contestable. Many people believe that ownership implies\ninheritance. But Mill once observed (Mill 1994 [1848], p. 28) that the\nprivate property idea implied only \u2018the right of each to his (or\nher) own faculties, to what he can produce by them, and to whatever he\ncan get for them in a fair market; together with his right to give\nthis to any other person if he chooses.\u2019 He said that passing\nthe property of individuals who made no disposition of it during their\nlifetime to their children \u2018may be a proper arrangement or not,\nbut it is no consequence of the principle of private property\u2019\n(ibid.). Definitive resolution of such controversies is probably\nimpossible. Some philosophers have suggested that certain concepts\nshould be regarded as \u2018essentially contested concepts\u2019\n(see Gallie 1956); if there is anything to this suggestion, private\nproperty might be one of them (see Waldron 1988, pp. 51\u20132).\n",
