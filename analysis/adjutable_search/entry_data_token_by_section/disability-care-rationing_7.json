    "main_text": "Disability as a systematic rationing consideration: ethical concerns || The dilemma created by CEA\n3.1 The dilemma created by CEA\n\nThe individual allocation scenarios just described are powerful\n\u201cintuition pumps\u201d (Dennett 2013) because they emphasize a\ndirect competition between two individuals over the same required\nhealth resource. Yet if the only lesson we can draw from the\nlife-saving and health improvement scenarios is that our intuitions\nabout whether disability matters are clearer the starker the contrast\nin benefit or cost, this does not seem to advance the debate very\nmuch. Given that there is already a concern about the unrealistic\nsimplicity of the individual cases, perhaps we can get a better result\nby asking whether, and in what way, disability is a relevant ethical\nconsideration as a general social policy or allocation strategy that\nwill be consistently and neutrally applied to everyone, without\nexception.\n\nIf we are considering a social policy or population strategy for\nallocation, we are seemingly bound by basic principles of procedural\nfairness that pre-empt special-pleading and other exceptions. These\nprinciples are also principles of rationality, and in the case of\nallocation policy they obviously apply. But there are also special\npresumptions about an allocation policy that also tap into our\nintuitions about the rationality of a general policy, but concern the\nspecific nature of an allocation policy. There appear to be three\npresumptions about such a policy that cannot be sensibly challenged:\nA) the rationing or prioritizing policy is necessary because health\nresources are scare; B) resource use effectiveness, if not the end of\nthe story, is at least part of it; and C) some ordinal measure of\nhealth outcomes must be used to compare outcomes.\n\nEffectiveness, as we saw, is both a matter of the costs of using a\nhealth resource and the benefits accrued. At the policy level it is\nfar more important to be clear about what range of costs are relevant\n(should we include indirect and lost opportunity cost?) as well as\nwhat constitutes a relevant benefit (should we include enhanced\nemployment prospects, a more financially secure family situation, and\nso on?). The cost side of the equation is rarely considered by\nbioethicists, which is a clear gap in the debate. The benefit side has\nbeen considered, as noted above, by Brock and others under the wider\nrubric of the \u201cseparate spheres\u201d problem (Brock 2003;\nBroome 2004). We can ignore these complications in what follows and\nrestrict the issue of effectiveness, as is usually done in this\nliterature, to a single criterion: the capacity to benefit\ndirectly from a health resource.\n\nWhatever our intuitions may suggest at the individual level, when we\nturn to a general allocation policy, it is clear that disability has a\npotential impact both on cost and the capacity to directly benefit,\nand a blanket refusal to take disability into account would be both\nirrational and unfair. Importantly, ignoring disability is irrational\nand unfair for everyone, including people with disabilities. If the\npresence of a disability makes a medical treatment ineffective,\nextremely impractical or vastly expensive, it would be foolish to\nignore this fact. It would be unfair to those without a disability who\nneed and could benefit from the treatment; but it would also be unfair\nfor a person with a disability to ignore the fact that some of his or\nher needs would be unsatisfied, and some medical treatment of no use\nto him or her (or potentially harmful). This means that disability is\nnot only ethically relevant at the policy level, but in fact it needs\nto be factored into the selection of resource or treatment and of the\nmode, method, and context by which the resource is delivered. \n\nBut if disability intrinsically affects costs of delivery and capacity\nto benefit, allocation policy appears to be trapped in a dilemma: CEA\nsystematically disadvantages people with disabilities in health\nresource prioritization, but it is both irrational and unfair (to\neveryone, including people with disabilities) to ignore\ndisability-related differences in costs and capacity to benefit when\nprioritizing health care resources.\n",
