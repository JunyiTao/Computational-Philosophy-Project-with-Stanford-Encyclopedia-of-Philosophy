    "main_text": "Eliminating Alternative Explanations || The Role of Epistemic Values\n2.3 The Role of Epistemic Values\n\nEpistemic values can be broadly characterized as those features (of a\ntheory or a theory in relation to evidence) that scientists value\nbecause they\u2019re believed to lead to epistemic goods like truth\nand understanding. Heather Douglas distinguishes between those\nepistemic values that are minimal criteria versus ideal desiderata.\nMinimal criteria are those values that are epistemically necessary:\nthey are \u201cgenuinely truth assuring\u201d and their absence\nindicates \u201csomething is wrong with our theory\u201d (Douglas\n2013: 799). These include features like internal consistency and\nempirical adequacy. In contrast, ideal desiderata are not required,\nbut are useful and often provide assurance that we are on the right\ntrack or that, if we\u2019re not on the right track, we will find out\nsooner rather than later. Ideal desiderata include values like\nsimplicity, unification, and novel prediction. For example, a simpler\ntheory may be easier to use and a theory capable of making novel\npredictions might assure researchers that the theory is not\noverfitting the available data (Douglas 2009a, 2009b; Douglas &\nMagnus 2013).\n\nComparative cognition researchers also appeal to epistemic values when\nevaluating theories and hypotheses. Researchers minimally expect\ntheories to be internally consistent and empirically adequate. When\ntwo competing theories are both consistent with the available\nempirical data, researchers evaluate them with respect to other\nepistemic values. For example, in the context of chimpanzee theory of\nmind research, Tomasello and Call (2006) note that two\nhypotheses\u2014theory of mind and learned behavioral\nrules\u2014account for the available experimental data. However, they\nargue that theory of mind provides a unified explanation of the\nexisting data, while the claim that chimpanzees rely on learned\nbehavioral rules requires positing a unique behavioral rule for each\nexperimental result. They also express concern that behavioral rules\nare ad hoc. Fletcher & Carruthers (2013) concur, maintaining\nthat\n\n\nthe behavior-rule account is only capable of \u201cpredicting\u201d\nnew findings after they are discovered, postulating a novel\nbehavior-rule for the purpose. (2013: 88)\n\n\nHere, we find researchers arguing in favor of one explanatory theory\nover another based on epistemic values like predictive power,\nunification, and coherence.\n\nOne epistemic value that has received a lot of attention from\nscientists and philosophers working in comparative cognition is\nsimplicity or parsimony (Dacey 2016). As we saw in the previous\nsection, the epistemic value of simplicity is often attributed to\nassociative learning, leading to debates about whether associative\nlearning is truly simple and, if so, what this means for theory\nchoice. However, another reason why simplicity has received a lot of\nattention is its connection to Morgan\u2019s Canon\u2014a\nmethodological principle widely adopted in research on animal\ncognition. This principle holds that when there are two or more\nplausible explanations for an animal\u2019s behavior, psychologists\nshould favor the explanation that appeals to \u201clower\u201d\nrather than \u201chigher\u201d psychical faculties (Fitzpatrick\n2008).\n\nMany philosophers have rejected Morgan\u2019s Canon as a useful\nmethodological principle. First, they argue that what counts as\n\u201csophisticated\u201d is often ambiguous (Sober 2005;\nFitzpatrick 2008; Meketa 2014). Simplicity has been used to\ndistinguish between sensory and conceptual reasoning,\nstimulus-response mechanisms and conscious thought, associative and\nnon-associative learning. Moreover, in all these cases, the contrast\nseems problematic (Andrews & Huss 2014). Second, if Morgan\u2019s\nCanon is interpreted as no more than the dictum that \u201csimpler is\nbetter or more likely to be true\u201d, then it is a poor research\nguide. There are numerous parsimony considerations one can make in\ncomparative research (ontological parsimony, explanatory parsimony,\nevolutionary parsimony): often these considerations pull in different\ndirections and rarely do they favor the conclusion urged by\nMorgan\u2019s Canon (Sober 2005; Fitzpatrick 2008; Dacey 2016).\nFinally, philosophers of science have argued that justifying\nsimplicity as a virtue is context dependent\u2014that is, it is not a\nvirtue that applies across the board (see Longino 2008). As Elliott\nSober writes:\n\n\nWhen a scientist uses the idea [of parsimony], it has meaning only\nbecause it is embedded in a very specific context of inquiry. Only\nbecause of a set of background assumptions does parsimony connect with\nplausibility in a particular research problem. What makes parsimony\nreasonable in one context therefore may have nothing in common with\nwhy it matters in another. (Sober 1990 [1994: 140])\n\n\nIf Sober is correct, then determining whether one should prefer the\nsimpler explanation will depend on the case at hand. Insofar as\nMorgan\u2019s Canon is a general methodological principle, meant to\nhold across a wide range of disparate cases or a \u201cblanket bias\ntowards endorsing lower explanations\u201d, it should be rejected,\naccording to this view (Fitzpatrick 2008: 243). Comparative cognition\nresearchers have reached similar conclusions. For example, Tomasello\nand Call (2006) write,\n\n\nwe are not strong proponents either of parsimony (unless one clearly\ndefines the criteria for parsimony) or of Morgan\u2019s\nCanon\u2014certainly not as substitutes for grappling with data when\nthere is plenty of it. (2006: 381)\n\n\nIt is worth noting that not all accounts of Morgan\u2019s Canon\ncharacterize it as a simplicity principle. For example, Simon\nFitzpatrick and Grant Goodrich (2017) argue that when one looks at\nConwy Lloyd Morgan\u2019s own formulation of the canon, it does not\ntake the form of a simplicity principle. Indeed, Morgan explicitly\nrejected simplicity as a criterion for choosing between competing\nexplanations. Instead, he held that one should choose the explanation\nthat best coheres with our observations and broader background\nknowledge. One such piece of background knowledge for Morgan was that\n\u201chigher\u201d faculties evolve from \u201clower\u201d ones;\nthus, the former will be rarer in nature than the latter, and this\nshould inform our choice of explanation. Similarly, Adrian Currie\n(2021) argues that Morgan\u2019s Canon is best understood as holding\nthat evolutionary ancient and highly evolvable traits are more likely\nto be found across the tree of life. Thus, explanations that appeal to\nsuch \u201clower\u201d traits should be preferred over those that do\nnot. Under this view, whether a cognitive trait is simple or complex\nis not relevant\u2014it is its expected taxonomic distribution and\nevolvability that matters.\n",
