    "main_text": "The Judgment of Taste || Normativity\n1.2 Normativity\n\nIn order to see what is special about pleasure in beauty, we must\nshift the focus back to consider what is special about the judgment of\ntaste. For Kant, the judgment of taste claims \u201cuniversal\nvalidity\u201d, which he describes as follows:\n\n\n\u2026 \u2026 if [someone] pronounces that something is beautiful,\nthen he expects the very same satisfaction of others: he judges not\nmerely for himself, but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it\nwere a property of things. Hence he says that the thing is\nbeautiful, and does not count on the agreement of others with his\njudgment of satisfaction because he has frequently found them to the\nagreeable with his own, but rather demands it from them. He\nrebukes them if they judge otherwise, and denies that they have taste,\nfor he nevertheless requires that they ought to have it; and to this\nextent one cannot say, \u201cEveryone has his special taste\u201d.\nThis would be as much as to say that there is no taste at all, i.e. no\naesthetic judgment that could make a rightful claim to the assent of\neveryone. (Kant 1790, 5: 212\u2013213 [2000: 98]; see also 2000:\n164\u2013166\u2013139)\n\n\nKant\u2019s idea is that in a judgment of taste, we demand or require\nagreement from other human beings in a way we do not in our judgments\nabout the niceness of Canary-wine, which is just a question of\nindividual preference. In many cases, in matters of taste and beauty,\nwe think that others ought to share our judgment, and we\nblame them if they don\u2019t. This is because the judgment of taste\nhas this aspiration to universal validity that it seems \u201cas\nif [beauty] were a property of things\u201d.\n\nNow, if the above quotation were all that Kant had to say by way of\nelucidating the judgment of taste, then he would not have said enough.\nFor the following question is left hanging: why do we require\nthat others share our judgment? We might want others to share\nour judgment for all sorts of strange reasons. Maybe we will feel more\ncomfortable. Maybe we will win a bet. And if we say that they\nought to judge a certain way, we need to say more. In what\nsense is this true? What if someone cannot appreciate some excellent\nwork of art because they are grief-stricken? What if it would distract\nsomeone from some socially worthy project? Of what nature is this\n\u201cought\u201d?\n\nWe can recast the point about how we ought to judge in austere terms\nby saying that there is a certain normative constraint on our\njudgments of taste, which is absent in our judgments about the\nniceness of Canary-wine. The most primitive expression of this\nnormativity is this: some are correct, others\nincorrect. Or perhaps, even more cautiously: some\njudgments are better than others. We do not think that something\nis beautiful merely to me, in the way that we might say that\nsome things just happen to give me sensuous pleasure. Of\ncourse, we might well say \u201cI think X is\nbeautiful\u201d, because we wish to express uncertainty, but where we\njudge confidently, we think of our judgment as being correct.\nAnd that means that we think that the opposite judgment would be\nincorrect. We assume that not all judgments of beauty are equally\nappropriate. \u201cEach to their own taste\u201d only applies to\njudgments of niceness and nastiness, which Kant calls \u201cjudgments\nof agreeableness\u201d (see Kant 1790, 5: 212\u2013213,\n291\u2013292 [2000: 97\u201398, 171\u2013172]).\n\nOf course, some people just know about food. There are\nexperts and authorities on making delicious food and in knowing what\nwill taste good (Kant 1790, 5: 213 [2000: 98]). But what these people\nknow is what will taste pleasurable to a certain kind of palate. In a\nsense, some things just do taste better than others, and some\njudgments of excellence in food are better than others. There is even\na sense in which some are correct and others incorrect. Still, this is\nonly relative to \u201cnormal\u201d human beings. There is no idea\nof correctness according to which someone with very unusual pleasures\nand displeasure is at fault, or according to which the majority of\nhuman beings can be wrong. (Kant says that judgments of agreeableness\nhave \u201cgeneral\u201d but not \u201cuniversal\u201d validity;\n1790, 5: 213 [2000: 213].) But in the case of judgments of taste or\nbeauty, correctness is not hostage to what most people like or judge.\nWe may say that it is a mistake to use much salt or sugar but that is\nonly because it swamps the flavors that are enjoyed by most\npeople.\n\nTo say that a judgment of taste makes a claim to correctness might\nseem merely to shift from the problematic \u201cought\u201d that is\ninvolved in a judgment of taste to a problematic\n\u201ccorrectness\u201d or \u201cbetterness\u201d. This may be\ninevitable. We are dealing with a normative notion, and while some\nnormative notions may be explainable in terms of others, we cannot\nexpress normative notions in non-normative terms.\n\nIn some cases, the correctness of a judgment of taste may be\nimpossibly difficult to decide. We may even think that there is no\nright answer to be had if we are asked to compare two very different\nthings. But in many other cases, we think that there\nis a right and a wrong answer at which we are aiming, and\nthat our judgments can be erroneous. If we do not think this, in at\nleast some cases, then we are not making a judgment of taste\u2014we\nare doing something else.\n\nIt is true that there is a popular idea that is sometimes expressed by\nsaying that no judgments of taste are really better than others.\nPeople sometimes say, \u201cThere is no right and wrong about matters\nof taste\u201d. Others express a related thought by saying that\nbeauty is \u201crelative\u201d to individual judgment or preference,\nor that it is \u201csocially relative\u201d. Such skeptical views\nhave some following outside the academy, as well as in certain of the\nhumanities. Many even express distaste for the idea that judgments of\ntaste have a normative claim, as if that would be uncouth or\noppressive. However, if we are describing our thought as it is, not\nhow it ought to be, then there is no getting away from the fact that\nnormativity is a necessary condition of judgments of taste or beauty.\nTwo points should embarrass the skeptic: firstly, people who express\nanti-normativist skeptical views are merely theorizing. In\nthe case of judgments of beauty, anti-normativist skepticism is out of\nstep with practice, especially their own practice. As with moral\nrelativism, one can almost always catch a professed skeptic about\njudgments of beauty making and acting on non-skeptical judgments of\nbeauty\u2014for example, in their judgments about music, nature and\neveryday household objects around them. Skeptics do not practice what\nthey preach. Secondly, one thing that drives people to this\nimplausible skepticism, which is so out of line with their own\npractice, is a perceived connection with tolerance or\nanti-authoritarianism. This is what they see as attractive in it. But\nthis is upside-down. For if \u201cit is all relative\u201d and no\njudgment is better than any other, then relativists put their\nown judgments beyond criticism, and they cannot get it wrong. Only\nthose who think that there is a right and wrong in judgment can\nmodestly admit that they might be wrong. What looks like an ideology\nof tolerance is, in fact, the opposite. \n\nSome so-called \u201cexperimental philosophers\u201d have questioned\nthe thesis that judgments of taste aspire to correctness on the basis\nof empirical evidence about those who make judgments of taste (Cova\n& Pain 2012). But it is not clear that the empirical evidence\ncited supports that skeptical thesis. For the evidence is just that\nthat the experimental subjects tick boxes that ask directly about\ncorrectness in judgment. But in psychological experiments there is a\nrequirement of opacity of the point of an experiment to the\nexperimental subjects (Hughes 2016). Furthermore, people often wax\nphilosophical in a way that is out of step with their actual\nconceptual practice. For example, some beginners in introductory moral\nphilosophy classes inconsistently claim that all moral views are\nequally correct, and that it is very bad to think otherwise. People\nwho think in a certain way may be defective in self-knowledge, just as\nthose who take part in social rituals may not be able to describe\nthose rituals (see Zangwill 2019 for critical discussion). We should\nalso bear in mind that the skeptical thesis would also be very\nsurprising given that it departs from not just centuries but millennia\nof reflection on our aesthetic lives. The answers to questionnaires\nabout correctness in judgment do not reveal the deep nature of\npeople\u2019s thoughts.\n",
