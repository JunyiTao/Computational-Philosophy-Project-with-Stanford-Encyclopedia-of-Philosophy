    "main_text": "Detecting Drift Empirically\n4. Detecting Drift Empirically\n\nThroughout the 20th and 21st centuries,\nbiologists have struggled to detect drift empirically. In particular,\nthey have experienced challenges in differentiating cases of drift\nfrom cases of selection. The Causal Process Account of Drift in\nparticular can help to make sense of why this is so, as will be\ndiscussed below. Drift and selection may be different sorts of causal\nprocesses (indiscriminate and discriminate sampling, respectively),\nbut they can produce similar outcomes. Biologists have thus struggled\nto identify distinctive outcomes for drift and selection, only to find\nunderdetermination re-emerge after biologists modified or added to\ntheir assumptions about the relevant processes (for a clear\ncharacterization of this, see Dietrich and Skipper 2007). Relatedly,\nbiologists have also disagreed over the relative prevalence of drift\nand selection (Beatty 1995, 1997); as noted above, these disagreements\nwere there almost from the outset with Fisher\u2019s response to the\nHagedoorns.\n",
