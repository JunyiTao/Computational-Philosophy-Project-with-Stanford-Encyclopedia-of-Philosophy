    "main_text": "Conceptual Foundations and Motivations || Philosophical categories of ultimacy\n1.5 Philosophical categories of ultimacy\n\nFor those who decide to model what is ultimate in the face of or\ninformed by these challenges, there are several common categories, or\n\u201cmodel types\u201d as Philip Clayton once called them, which\ndistinguish kinds of models of what is ultimate from each other.\nKnowing these categories can organize what might be an otherwise\nhaphazard array of models, in something like the way knowing what an\noak, maple and birch are can help sort the sights on a walk through a\nforest. The categories of ultimacy are best grasped by framing them\nwith a question. For example, Hartshorne and Reese (1953) categorized\nmodels of God in particular as the logically possible variations on a\ntheme of five questions, whose positive answers get symbolized by\nETCKW:\n\nE: Is God eternal?\nT: Is God temporal?\nC: Is God conscious?\nK: Does God know the world?\nW: Does God include the world?\n\n\nTo use models that will be discussed in\n Section 2,\n Shankara\u2019s pantheism is ECKW since he takes Brahman to be an\n\u201cEternal Consciousness, Knowing and including the World\u201d\nbut which is atemporal and never changes; Hartshorne and Reese\u2019s\nown panentheism is ETCKW, etc. (see their 1953 [2000: 17] and Viney\n2013 for more examples). Wildman (2017) has his own set of questions\nand entire system built out of them (more in\n Section 3),\n which adds another important question that ETCKW leaves out or\nperhaps merely implies: Is what is ultimate\npersonal/anthropomorphic\u2014i.e., is it aware and does it have\nintentions\u2014or is it impersonal/non-anthropomorphic? One might\nalso look for functional categories: is what is ultimate the\nefficient, material or final cause of the universe?, does it intervene\nin it?, does it provoke religious experience?, and more.\n\nAnother question that may be asked about a particular model is: How\nmany ultimates does the model conceive ultimacy to be? Though the very\nidea of plural ultimates sounds contradictory\u2014wouldn\u2019t one\nthing need to beat out all competitors in order to satisfy the\nsuperlatives \u201cmost fundamental\u201d fact,\n\u201chighest\u201d value, \u201cdeepest\u201d source of\nfulfillment?\u2014those who model \u201cultimate multiplicity\u201d\nsee a tie for first place. Some models of Zoroaster\u2019s view, for\ninstance, take there to be two ultimates, the good Ahura Mazda and the\nevil Angra Mainyu engaged in fundamental battle (though such models\nwill have to explain why Ahura Mazda is not the true ultimate given\nhis apparent axiological edge on Angra Mainyu). John Cobb and David\nRay Griffin at least some of the time take there to be three distinct\nultimates: the Supreme Being experienced in theistic experiences,\nBeing Itself (or emptiness) experienced in acosmic experiences, and\nthe Cosmos experienced in cosmic experiences (Griffin 2005:\n 47\u201349).[20]\n Monica Coleman models what is ultimate in traditional Yoruba religion\nas a \u201ccommunotheism\u201d, in which \u201cthe Divine is a\ncommunity of gods who are fundamentally related to each other but\nontologically equal\u201d, including\nOlo\u0301du\u0300mare\u0300 and the 401\no\u0300ri\u0300s\u0327a\u0300 (2013: 345\u2013349). All the\nmodels we will look at in\n Section 2\n will be \u201cultimate unities\u201d although there will be some\ndiversity in the unity for the panentheisms in particular. George\nMavrodes also cautions us to be wary of the unity/multiplicity\ndistinction:\n\n\nthere are monotheisms that seem to include an element of\nmultiplicity\u2014e.g. Christianity with its puzzling idea of the\ndivine trinity\u2014and views of divine multiplicity\u2014such as\nthe African religions [have]\u2014that seem to posit some sort of\nunity composed of a large number of individual divine entities. (2013:\n660)\n\n\nProbably the most frequently-used categories to sort models from each\nother are the logically exhaustive answers to the question: How does\nthe ultimate or ultimates relate to the world? Though the answers (and\nquestion actually) are commonly framed with the word\n\u201cGod\u201d, as the theos root in some of the category\nnames below belies, their descriptions at least are framed here with\n\u201cultimacy\u201d to include non-theistic ultimates,\n too:[21]\n\nMonism (literally, one-ism): There exists just one thing\nor one kind of thing (the \u201cOne\u201d or \u201cUnity\u201d),\ndepending on how the monism is read: either ultimacy is identical to\nthe world, or all there is is ultimacy, or all there is is the world.\nPantheism is a species of monism in which the one thing or\nkind of thing is God, or as Linda Mercadante once said in\nconversation, it is a monism in which the emphasis is on the divinity\nof the world instead of on the worldliness of the divine. Baruch\nSpinoza\u2019s view of \u201cGod, or Nature\u201d (Deus sive\nnatura) is often deemed a\n pantheism,[22]\n though some experts deem it a panentheism (1677, Part IV.4; see,\ne.g., Edwin Curley 2013).\nPanentheism (all-in-God-ism): The world is a proper part\nof ultimacy. I.e., though the world is in ultimacy, ultimacy is more\nthan the world. Panentheism is a wide tent since there is ambiguity in\nthe \u201cin\u201d, but R. T. Mullins, for example, offers one\ndisambiguated panentheism: take space and time to be attributes of\nGod, and \u201caffirm that the universe is literally in God because\nthe universe is spatially and temporally located in God\u201d (2016:\n343).\nMerotheism (part-God-ism): Ultimacy is a proper part of\nthe world. I.e., though ultimacy is in the world, the world is more\nthan ultimacy. This type is rare, but see, e.g., Alexander 1920 and\nDraper 2019 (more soon).\nDualism (two-ism): Ultimacy is not the world and the\nworld is not ultimacy, so there are two fundamentally different things\nor kinds of things, depending on how the underlying ontology is read.\nDualism includes both the view that ultimacy and the world are\ndisjoint (they share no parts) and the view that they bear a relation\nof proper overlap (they overlap in part, but not in\n whole).[23]\n\n\nThe various models of God, Brahman and the Dao in\n Section 2\n taken together will instantiate all four of these categories.\n",
