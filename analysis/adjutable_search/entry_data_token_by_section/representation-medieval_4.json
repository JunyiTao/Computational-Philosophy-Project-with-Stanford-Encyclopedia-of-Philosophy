It rests on a theory of mental\nrepresentation that combined the notions of cause and signification. A\nconcept or a mental term on this view represents because it is caused\nefficiently by a thing in the world. It signifies that thing also\nbecause of the causal relation between them. On Ockham\u2019s view, a\nmental representation or concept is caused by an intuitive cognition.\nHe explains:\n\nIntuitive cognition is the proper cognition of a singular not because\nof its greater likeness to one thing more than another but because it\nis naturally caused by one thing and not by another; nor can it be\ncaused by another. If you object that it can be caused by God alone, I\nreply that this is true: such a visual apprehension is always apt to\nbe caused by one created object and not by another; and if it is\ncaused naturally, it is caused by one thing and not by another, and it\nis not able to be caused by another. (Quodlibeta Septem 1.13)\n\n\nAccording to Ockham\u2019s metaphysics there are only individuals in\nthe world so that when an individual causes a concept to exist in the\nmind, it causes an individual concept and hence a singular conception\nof itself. Nothing else can cause that concept (except perhaps God).\nThe singular concept functions as the word of the object that caused\nit in our language of thought. It is an atomic constituent that can\nthen be combined to form more complex concepts or sentences in the\nlanguage.\n\nOckham\u2019s notion of concept acquisition and mental representation\nis developed as part of a very sophisticated theory of thought\ninvolving not only a theory of signification, but also a whole range\nof logico-semantic properties such as connotation and supposition. It\nexplains how concepts, which in turn are the direct objects of belief\nand knowledge, are assembled into mental sentences describing the\nworld (for the details, see Panaccio 2004).\n",
