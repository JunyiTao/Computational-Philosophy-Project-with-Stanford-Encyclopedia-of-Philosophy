    "main_text": "Methodology || Names and Relations\n2.3 Names and Relations\n\nThe Koran often speaks of God\u2019s \u201cnames\u201d\n(asm\u00e2\u2019), and it mentions a good number of\nthem\u2014not \u201cninety-nine\u201d, as is traditionally said,\nbut anywhere between seventy and twice as many, depending on the\ncriteria used in counting. The names, which are often called\n\u201cattributes\u201d (sif\u00e2t), provide the points of\nreference for Islamic theology. Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee distinguishes\nbetween \u201cthe names of the names\u201d (asm\u00e2\u2019\nal-asm\u00e2\u2019), which are the names voiced in human\nlanguage, and the names in themselves, which are realities in divinis.\nTheologians wrote many books listing the names and explaining their\nsignificance for God, the cosmos, and the human soul. Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee devoted a book-length chapter of the\nOpenings specifically to them, and he composed an independent\ntreatise summarizing their role in human becoming (Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee, Kit\u00e2b kashf\nal-ma\u2018n\u00e2).\n\nNames are basic to the quest for deiformity because the Real in\nitself, in its very Essence (dh\u00e2t), is known only to\nitself. \u201cOthers\u201d (ghayr), which are the\nsigns/verses written out in the Three Books, know the Essence only\ninasmuch as it reveals itself to them. In other words, although\neverything is a \u201cface\u201d (wajh) of\nGod\u2014\u201cWherever you turn, there is God\u2019s face\u201d\n(Koran 2:115)\u2014to make distinctions among the omnipresent faces\nwe need to know their names and recognize their haqqs.\n\nThe word used to designate the Essence, al-dh\u00e2t, is a\npronoun meaning \u201cpossessor of\u201d. Originally it was an\nabbreviation for dh\u00e2t al-asm\u00e2\u2019, \u201cthe\npossessor of the names\u201d; hence the synonymous term,\nal-musamm\u00e2, \u201cthe Named\u201d. The Koran refers\nto the Essence as \u201cHe\u201d (huwa), which alerts us\nonly to the fact that something is there. The word can just as well be\ntranslated as \u201cIt\u201d, of course, because the Essence is\nbeyond gender, but Arabic grammar classifies all nouns and pronouns as\neither masculine or feminine (indeed, when speaking of the Essence,\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee and others use the pronoun hiya,\n\u201cShe\u201d, because dh\u00e2t is feminine, and they\nsometimes explain why the Essence is more properly feminine than\nmasculine; Murata 1992, 196\u201399). What we know from the names is\nthat \u201cHe/She\u201d is merciful, knowing, alive, and so on, but\nin itself the Essence remains unknown. Each name designates a specific\nquality that becomes manifest the moment there is talk of the Real\n(al-haqq) and creation (al-khalq). Hence Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee says that the divine names can properly be called\nrelations (nisab).\n\nThe unique characteristics of human beings derive from their ability\nto name things, which in turn results from the fact that they alone\nwere created in the form of the all-comprehensive name. A proof-text\nis the verse, \u201cGod taught Adam the names, all of them\u201d\n(Koran 2:30). This means not only the names of the\nparticulars\u2014God\u2019s signs in the Three Books\u2014but also\nthe names of the universals, which the Koran calls God\u2019s\n\u201cmost beautiful names\u201d (al-asm\u00e2\u2019\nal-husn\u00e2). Human beings in any case have the potential to\nknow all names, but not the Essence named by the names. About that one\ncan only know \u201cthat it is\u201d (the fact of its existence),\nnot \u201cwhat it is\u201d (its quiddity). Inasmuch as the names\ncorrespond to the Essence, their meanings remain unknown, so they are\nsimply markers of transcendence or \u201cincomparability\u201d\n(tanz\u00eeh). Inasmuch as they denote an added quality,\nsuch as mercy, knowledge, life, forgiveness, or vengeance, they\nindicate God\u2019s immanence or \u201csimilarity\u201d\n(tashb\u00eeh). In short, Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s\ntheological vision combines the apophatic and kataphatic\napproaches.\n",
