    "main_text": "Basic Categories || Knowledge and Action\n1.3 Knowledge and Action\n\nIn traditional China knowledge and the way in which it is obtained\n(method of comprehension) was viewed as an important element of human\nexistence. The dispute as to which of the elements forming the binary\ncategorical pair of knowledge and action (zhi, xing)\nhad priority, constituted one of the crucial debates in traditional,\nas well as modern Chinese epistemology. In the context of the\nclassical holistic worldview that was inherently permeated with\nethical values, the recognition of reality was linked to the active\ninvolvement of humanity in their interactive relationship with their\nsocial and natural environment. Knowledge (zhi) was thus seen\nas a valuable factor, necessarily and inextricably linked to human\nactivities and the implementation of social practice (xing):\nany separation of knowledge and (social) practice was equated with the\nseparation of human beings from the world in which they have found\nthemselves. The close proximity between knowledge and action was seen\nas the close proximity between an individual and the world, because\naction was a means for his/her self-transformation and the\ntransformation of the world in the world. Hence, the unity or\nnon-unity of knowledge and action was always a measure of the unity or\nnon-unity of humanity and the world (Cheng 1989: 207).\n\nThe crucial aspect of the unity between knowledge and action (zhi\nxing heyi \u77e5\u884c\u5408\u4e00) has been emphasized\nand upgraded in the developing course of Neo-Confucian philosophy\nduring the Song and Ming dynasties by Wang Shouren (alias Wang\nYangming,1472\u20131529). This holistic thesis not only defined the\nentire ethical foundation of the epistemology of the School of\nHeart-Mind (Xin xue \u5fc3\u5b78) but is also typical of most\nsimilar philosophical precepts. (Wang 1933: Xu Ai yinyan, 5) \n\nIn the 17th century, the Academy of the Eastern Forest\n(Donglin shuyuan \u6771\u6797\u66f8\u9662) and the\nmaterialist philosopher Wang Fuzhi (1619\u20131692) advocated the\npriority of action (xing). Since this position was in\nopposition to the views of the orthodox Neo-Confucians, and since it\nrepresented a new, predominantly materialistic opposition to the\nNeo-Confucian tradition, it set the stage for the ideological\nstruggles which took place during the last Chinese dynasty. The\ncontribution of scholars from the School of Practical Learning\n(shixue \u5be6\u5b78) is especially valuable in the\ncontext of the further development of the binary category of knowledge\nand action. Due to their rediscovery of the orthodox classics and\ntheir unstinting emphasis on the significance of the practical\napplicability of ideas, they not only consistently placed the archaic\nconnection between knowledge and action at the center of\nepistemological thought, but also gave it a more concrete emphasis, as\nin the relationship between thought and (political) practice. This\nrediscovered and somehow remodeled traditional connection would\nsubsequently influence the great majority of later Chinese theories of\nknowledge, while also underpinning one of the crucial approaches to\nthe specifically Chinese understanding of Marxist philosophy. In his\nessay \u201cOn Praxis\u201d (Shijian lun), even Mao Zedong\nexplicitly argued for a similar epistemological and axiological\nprimacy of praxis over theory (2014: 8). It should be pointed out,\nhowever, that in their social theories, Chinese Marxists subscribed to\nthe idea of the inseparability and dialectical relation of both\ncategories, which in the context of Chinese ideational tradition had\nalways been viewed in terms of complementary bipolarity. Although they\nconsidered social praxis as the element which imparted meaning to any\n(theoretical) reasoning, it was precisely this kind of renewed\nsynthesis of knowledge and action which formed the epistemological\nbridge linking the classical Chinese tradition to the new ideas of\nWestern Modernity.\n",
