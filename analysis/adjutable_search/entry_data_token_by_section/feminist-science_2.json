Feminist Critique of Science\n\nIt is tempting to think that the main benefit of feminist perspectives\non science has been to identify sexist bias in science and that the\nconsequently the elimination of bias would be a sufficient corrective.\nUndeniably, there are cases where bias is the primary issue, however,\nit is not clear that its removal is sufficient to serve feminist aims.\nEven if it were, however, identifying and eliminating bias may be more\ndifficult than it might seem for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, bias is not always easy to identify. Even with a good will,\nscientists may be unable to identify problematic background\nassumptions since such assumptions are often deeply embedded in\nresearch practices, shared by the community involved in those\npractices (the broader social milieu), and so not readily available to\nscrutiny. Bias is not simply the tendency of individuals to prefer\nparticular views or to ignore the alternatives. \n\n\n[I]t also includes unreflective assent to background assumptions\nabout, for instance, causal relationships or how natural or social\nphenomena are to be classified. (Brister 2018: 214\u2013215)\n\n\nSecond, the idea that the best science is that which eliminates bias\nevokes an ideal of science as value-free\u2014that is, free from\nmoral, cultural, or political values. While this conception of science\ndominated philosophy of science in the first half of the twentieth\ncentury it has since been challenged. The extent to which values may\nplay a legitimate role, when, and in what aspects of science, has been\nextensively explored during the past few decades (see\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science\u2014section\n 7, also Lacey 1999; Kincaid, Dupr\u00e9, & Wylie 2007; Elliott\n2017). Feminist philosophers of science have been active participants\nin this discussion.\n\nFinally, bias has sometimes been understood as a matter of the\nidiosyncratic and irrelevant beliefs or attitudes of individual\nscientists. This understanding of bias obscures the social nature of\nscience. Scientists typically work in teams, not in isolation, and the\nframeworks within which they labor have their own social histories.\nResearchers are trained by other scientists to adopt the practices of\nthe disciplines within which they work. In addition, the assessment of\ntheir research is done within that social context. These social\naspects of science provide an intellectual architecture that both\nshapes and constrains research.\n",
