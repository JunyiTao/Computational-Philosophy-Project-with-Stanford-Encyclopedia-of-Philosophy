    "main_text": "Can Normativity Be Given a Naturalistic Explanation? || Normative Realism\n3.2 Normative Realism\n\nNormative realism sees a strict analogy between normative truths, such\nas the putative truth that it would be bad to have another Dr. Pepper,\nand non-normative truths, such as the fact that Dr. Pepper is sweet.\nIn each case, there is a declarative sentence that expresses a\nproposition that can be the intensional object of a belief, and,\nfurther, the belief, proposition, and sentence are true just when the\nstate of affairs they represent obtains. So, if our beliefs are\ncorrect, there is the state of affairs or the fact that Dr. Pepper is\nsweet, and there is the state of affairs or the fact that it would be\nbad to have another Dr. Pepper. We believe both that Dr. Pepper is\nsweet and that it would be bad to have another one. And we express\nthese beliefs by asserting that Dr. Pepper is sweet or that it would\nbe bad to have another one, respectively.\n\nAccordingly, normative realists hold both that there are states of\naffairs that are represented by, and that are the truth conditions of,\nnormative propositions, and that there are properties that are\nreferred to or ascribed by normative predicates. Mind-independent\nrealist theories go beyond this basic position to add that the truth\nconditions of normative truths are \u201cmind-independent\u201d in\nsome important sense. (We discuss the idea of mind-independence in\n section 5\n of this entry.) So we can distinguish between the view we will call\n\u201cbasic normative realism\u201d and the view we will call\n\u201cmind-independent normative realism\u201d. Some philosophers\nwant to reserve the term \u201crealism\u201d for the\nmind-independent form, and we will also tend to follow this usage\nexcept where we want to describe a theory as an example of basic\nrealism.\n\nThere is also the distinction, among realist theories, between\nnormative naturalism and normative non-naturalism. As we said before,\nnormative naturalists hold that normative predicates ascribe or refer\nto natural properties, and some if not all normative\nnaturalists hold that normative properties are\nnatural ones. We will discuss normative naturalism and non-naturalism\nin what follows.\n\nNote a couple of points. First, there is nothing in normative\nrealism that commits realists to holding that the normative properties\nand facts are robustly normative rather than merely formally\nnormative. But we have set aside normative formalism. In what follows,\nwe consider attempts to account for robust normativity. Second,\nas we will explain in\n section 3.4,\n normative realism is compatible with a kind of normative\nconceptualism, and this means that realists are not committed to\nholding that the wordly states of affairs that are the truth\nconditions of normative propositions, and the properties\nthat are ascribed by normative predicates, are themselves\nnormative. They could hold instead, roughly, that normativity is\na feature only of normative concepts.\n\nAnti-realist theories deny one or more of the claims that are\ndefinitive of realism, whether of basic realism or of mind-independent\nrealism. There are several different kinds of normative anti-realism.\nOne kind is normative nihilism, or the error theory, which we have\nalready discussed. Non-cognitivist expressivism is another kind of\nanti-realist theory. A third kind is the non-realist cognitivism that\nwas advocated by Derek Parfit (2011, 2017). Still another kind is a\nfamily of \u201cconstructivist \u201dtheories, which reject the\nmind-independence condition, although some of them seem committed to\nthe tenets of basic normative realism (Copp 2013). For examples, see\nChristine Korsgaard\u2019s work (1996) and Sharon Street\u2019s\n(2008, 2010). (This entry does not discuss non-realist cognitivism or\nconstructivism. See the entry on\n constructivism in metaethics.)\n We consider anti-realist attempts to account for robust normativity\nin\n section 3.4\n as well as in some of the subsections in\n section 4.\n\nIf a theory countenances the existence of normative facts,\nnormative properties, normative propositions, and normative concepts,\nit ideally would want to explain what the normativity of each of\nthese consists in. To bring the challenge into focus, consider a\nnormative property such as wrongness. Ideally, one might\nthink, realists would want to provide accounts on two levels. First,\nthey might aspire to provide an account of the essential nature of\nwrongness itself, an account that reveals, inter\nalia, that wrongness is essentially normative. Second,\nrealists might aspire to provide an account of the essential nature of\nthe second-order property of being normative that is instantiated by\nwrongness. These accounts would be constitutive explanations,\nin the sense we introduced. Our question is whether the account of the\nlatter, second-order property could be naturalistic.\n\nWith respect to the normative concepts \u2013 concepts such as the\nconcepts <wrong> or <virtue> \u2013 the explanatory\naccounts we are looking for would be conceptual analyses, so\nthey presumably would be a priori. This does not mean that they would\nbe obviously true, nor even that any rational person who had\nthe concept would recognize a correct analysis as being correct. (For\ndiscussion of this point, see entries\n analysis\n and\n moral non-naturalism, section on the open question argument).\n With respect to the normative properties \u2013 properties such as the\nproperty of being wrong, or that of being a virtue \u2013 the\nexplanatory accounts we are looking for would be metaphysical\nanalyses, so, arguably, they would not be a priori (Schroeder\n2005, King 1998, Rosen 2010). Since these accounts would be (putative)\naccounts of the essential natures of the properties, they\nwould be necessarily true if true at all, and they would underwrite\nidentity claims. If it is the essential nature of something\u2019s\nbeing an acid that it be a proton donor, then to be an acid is to be a\nproton donor. If it the essential nature of wrongness is being\nA, B, and C, then to be wrong is to be\nA, B, and C.\n\nOne might think it is obvious that there could not be a correct\nnaturalistic constitutive explanation of any of the normative concepts\nor properties, nor of the normativity property or properties\nthemselves. But before we turn to this issue, we will consider a\nvariety of other views, both realist and anti-realist, and discuss\ntheir approaches to explaining normativity.\n",
