    "main_text": "\n\nThe \u2018Dialectical School\u2019 denotes a group of early\nHellenistic philosophers that were loosely connected by philosophizing\nin the \u2014 Socratic \u2014 tradition of Eubulides of Miletus and\nby their interest in logical paradoxes, propositional logic and\ndialectical expertise. Its two best-known members, Diodorus Cronus and\nPhilo the Logician, made ground-breaking contributions to the\ndevelopment of theories of conditionals and modal logic. Philo\nintroduced a version of material implication; Diodorus devised a\nforerunner of strict implication. Each developed a system of modal\nnotions that satisfies the basic logical requirements laid down by\nmodern standard modal theories. In antiquity, Diodorus Cronus was\nfamous for his so-called Master Argument, which aims to prove that\nonly the actual is possible.\n",
