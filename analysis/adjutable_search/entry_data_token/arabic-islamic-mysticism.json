The source of mysticism and the mystical\nelements in Islam are to be traced to the Qur\u2019an and the Islamic\ndoctrine itself. Some of the Qur\u2019anic verses have been viewed by\nthe mystics and philosopher-mystics of Islam as allegorical and\nesoteric hints for those who can see them. \u201cGod is the Outward\nand the Inward\u201d (Qu\u2019ran 57:3), \u201che for whom wisdom\nis given, he truly has received abundant good\u201d (Qu\u2019ran\n2:269), and the famous light verses\n\nGod is the Light of the heavens and the earth, the likeness of His\nlight is as a niche wherein is a lamp, the lamp is a glass, the glass\nas it were a glittering star kindled from a blessed tree, an olive\nthat is neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil well-night\nwould shine, even if no fire touched it; light upon lights; God guides\nto His light whom He will. And God strikes similitudes for man, and\nGod has knowledge of everything. (Qu\u2019ran 24:35)\n\n\ncan all be seen as containing esoteric insight. Through out the ages,\nthese verses have inspired a number of Muslim gnostics, some of whom,\nsuch as Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn Suhraward\u012b (12th CE)\nand Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 (16th CE) have written\ncommentaries upon them (e.g., Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s\nOn the Hermeneutics of the Light Verse of the Quran).\n\nFrom a mystical perspective, all later developments and interactions\nbetween Islamic philosophy and other intellectual traditions should\ntherefore be seen as rational expressions of the mystical elements\nwithin an Islamic milieu. Mystical elements exist in Islam in two\ndifferent and independent ways. Practically, Sufism represents the\nesoteric dimension of Islam in its purest form, while theoretically\nsalient features of Islamic mysticism were gradually incorporated into\nthe Islamic philosophical tradition. Islamic mysticism, therefore,\nstands on two pillars: first practical, then philosophical. That is,\nesoteric wisdom can either be attained through practical wisdom, which\nincludes inner purification and asceticism, or through a type of\nphilosophy which includes, but is not limited to discursive\nreasoning.\n", "toc": [{"#NeopSufi": "1.

Neoplatonism and Sufism\n\nFollowing the early theological schools of thought in Islam, among\nwhich were the determinists (Qadarites), the eschatologists\n(Murj\u2018aites and Wa\u2018idites) and the faith\nbased theologians (Ash\u2018arites), there came the Islamic\nphilosophical tradition and its many different schools of thought.\nEven though Al-Kind\u012b is regarded to be the first Muslim\nphilosopher, the full impact of Hellenic thought on Islamic philosophy\nis best seen in the philosophical edifice of Ab\u016b Nasr\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (10th CE) Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b,\nwho is considered to be the father of logic in the Islamic\nphilosophical tradition, is also the first to have embraced\nNeoplatonism, albeit in a limited sense. It was his paradigm that\npaved the way for mysticism to enter Islamic philosophy.\n\nNeoplatonism, which has remained one of the salient features of\nIslamic philosophy, has performed two functions: the intellectual and\nthe practical, both of which have become an integral part of living a\nphilosophical life. Philosophically, Neoplatonism provides answers to\nmost major questions within the context of Islam, such as how\nmultiplicity came from unity and how corporality emanated from an\nincorporeal God, as well as explaining the ascending and descending\norder of beings.\n\nMysticism in Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b manifests itself in two ways,\nphilosophical and practical. Philosophically, as is evident in The\nLetter Concerning the Intellect (Ris\u0101lah\nfi\u2019l-\u2018aql), his interpretation of the concept of the\nfour intellects paved the road for his successor Avicenna (Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101) (981\u20131037 CE), who made full use of\nNeoplatonism. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tries in his writings not only\nto reconcile the opinions of Plato and Aristotle, with Plato seen as\nsomewhat of a mystical figure, but also, in his discussions of\npolitical philosophy, he replaced Plato\u2019s philosopher-king with\nan Imam whose understanding of truth is intuitive, who knows not only\ntheoretical virtues but also the practical ones. However, even though\nhis musical compositions are sung among some Sufi orders in Turkey and\nthe Indo-Pakistani continent and one can see the influence of Sufism\nin his Bezels of Wisdom (Fu\u1e63\u016b\u1e63\nal-h\u0323ikam), reports concerning him having been a practicing\nSufi are quite nebulous.\n\nAs to the master of the Peripatetics, Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101)\nhimself, the consensus of scholars is that Avicenna was a rationalist\nwho embraced certain concepts from Plato, Aristotle and Neoplatonism\nand that the salient feature of his philosophical writings are\ndiscursive in nature. From here on, there are generally two distinct\ninterpretations of Avicennan philosophy: Those who see him only as a\nrationalist who had nothing to do with mysticism and those who argue\nthat later Avicenna had embraced mysticism as is reflected in some of\nhis later works.\n\nMost Western scholars of Avicenna who see him only as a rationalist,\nsimilar to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Averroes, (Gutas 2006, Adamson\n2013) primarily rely on his discursive and rationalistic writings.\nMany Muslim philosophers in particular Iranian scholars of Avicenna\nhave a more inclusive reading of his writings and tend to agree that\nin the later period of his life, Avicenna developed an interest in\nmysticism. (Nasr & Leaman 1996, Inati 1996).\n\nFor Avicenna, similar to many other Muslim philosophers, the ultimate\nphilosophical endeavor was to unveil the mystery of creation in\nparticular; how Divine unity became the multiplicity of the world of\nexistents. To resolve this riddle, Avicenna adopts the Neoplatonic\nscheme of emanation which has also been used not only by Sufis and\nIslamic gnostics to explain the spiritual journey of man towards God\nbut also, by almost all philosopher-mystics from Suhraward\u012b and\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 to Sabziw\u0101r\u012b and\n\u1e6cab\u0101\u1e6dab\u0101\u2019\u012b.\n\nAvicenna was not a practicing Sufi with any known affiliation to a\nSufi order. In fact, Avicenna\u2019s meeting with the great Sufi\nmaster Ab\u016b Sa\u2018\u012bd Abu\u2019l-Khayr (d. 1049 CE) and\nthe presence of an \u201coriental philosophy\u201d\n(al-\u1e25ikmat al-mashraqiyyah) in his writing in all\nlikelihood are apocryphal. However, the presence of mystical elements\nin some of his later works is held by some to be undeniable\n(Aminrazavi 2003). For instance, in the ninth chapter of his\nphilosophical masterpiece Remarks and Treatments\n(al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t wa\u2019l-tanbih\u0101t), in a section\nentitled On the Stations of Knowers (F\u012b maq\u0101m\u0101t\nal-\u2018\u0101rif\u012bn), Avicenna appears to offers an\nexplanation of the Sufi doctrine and openly to defend the gnostic and\nSufi method of attaining truth. While the authorship of some of his\nPersian writings are subject to debate, in some of his allegorical\nwritings, such as Treatise on Ascendance (Mi\u2018r\u0101j\nn\u0101mah), Treatise on Birds (Ris\u0101lat al-\u1e6da\u012br),\nSalm\u0101n and Abs\u0101l, Son of the Living Awake (\u1e24ayy\nibn Yaqz\u0323\u0101n) and Treatise on Love (Ris\u0101lah\nfi\u2019l-\u2018ishq) not to mention his famous poem Ode of\nthe Soul (al-Qa\u1e63idah al-\u2018ayniyyah), the presence of\nSufi and gnostic elements are vividly apparent to those who follow\nthis interpretation.\n\nWith Avicenna, who represents the pinnacle of rationalistic philosophy\nin Persia, came two other intellectual trends. On the one side there\nwas the towering figure of Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101mid\nGhazz\u0101l\u012b, who rejected philosophy altogether and became the\nexponent of Sufism alone. On the other side, there arose\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012bs philosophy, which incorporated Sufi and\nHermetico-Pythagorean ideas within a philosophical context.\n\nGhazz\u0101l\u012b, an orthodox jurist and a major exponent of faith\nbased theology (Ash\u2018arite) having studied philosophy,\nthought discursive reasoning stood on a solid ground but soon turned\nagainst philosophy, offering a devastating critique of reason in his\nThe Incoherence of Philosophers (Tah\u0101fut\nal-fal\u0101sifah). Having been disillusioned with intellectual\nsciences, he practiced asceticism for a number of years in seclusion\nand finally found his answers in the Sufi tradition. The spiritual\njourney of Ghazz\u0101l\u012b from an orthodox jurist to a Sufi is one\nof the most remarkable accounts of the transformation of a Muslim sage\nwho turned from the outward to the inner life of Islam and found\nSufism to be the only path that leads to truth. He spent the later\npart of his life teaching, writing and practicing Sufism.\n\nGhazz\u0101l\u012b is one of the few mystics whose brand of Sufism\nembraces religious orthodoxy, a gnostic intellectual framework, and\nthe more practical and ascetic dimension of the spiritual path.\nContrary to the antinomian Sufis, who violated the Islamic law\n(Shari\u2018ah) and the more relaxed attitude of some of the\nother Sufis, Ghazz\u0101l\u012b was an austere and ardent observer of\nIslamic law.\n\nHe wrote extensively on mysticism, arguing it to be the only right\npath to truth. A notable piece among his writings on mysticism is\nThe Niche of Light (Mishk\u0101t al-anw\u0101r), a\nsignificant work of an illuminationist nature and one that influenced\nthe formation of the doctrine of illumination (ishr\u0101q)\nby Suhraward\u012b (Aminrazavi 1996). Also, parts of his Magnum Opus,\nRevival of Religious Sciences (I\u1e25y\u0101\u2019\nal-\u2018ul\u016bm al-d\u012bn\u012b), such as book thirty-five\nof the Ih\u0323y\u0101\u2019: The Book of Faith in Divine Unity\nand Trust in Divine Providence, are essentially devoted to an\nexplication of the Sufi doctrine. He also has written numerous shorter\ncommentaries on the spiritual significance of fasting, praying,\ninvocation of divine names and attributes, and spiritual music as\ninstruments of the catharsis of the soul.\n2. The Isma\u2018ili Tradition\n\nOn the Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012bs side, the use of the esoteric\ndoctrine of Hermeticism and the Greco-Alexandrian mystical teachings\nwere adopted by Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012bs philosophers. Such\nconcepts as emanation from the One, asceticism, the body as prison\nwith the soul as its inmate, initiation into the mysteries of gnosis\n(ma\u2018rifah), levels of interpretations of spiritual\nhermeneutics (ta\u2019w\u012bl), sacred geometry with its\nmystical symbolism, cycles of prophecy, and the initiatic role of\nShi\u2018ite Imams are among many of the mystical themes of\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b philosophical tradition. Among the most\nnotable Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b figures in the 10th\nand 11th century CE is Jabir Ibn \u1e24ayy\u0101n, (c.\n721\u2013c. 815 CE) who was more of a scientist and chemist and as\nsuch offered in his The Book of Stones (Kit\u0101b\nal-a\u1e25j\u0101r) a mystical interpretation of the science of\nletters and the esoteric mathematical concepts that are influenced by\nPythagorean geometry. It should be noted that he was a figure under\nwhose name works by many diverse thinkers may have been collected.\nAb\u016b Ya\u2018qub Sijist\u0101n\u012b was also a notable figure in\nthe movement whose mystical writings in Unveiling of the\nHidden (Kashf al-ma\u1e25j\u016bb) and The Book of\nWell Springs (Kit\u0101b al-yan\u0101bi\u2018) provide an\nesoteric commentary on major philosophical and religious matters (see\nNasr & Aminrazavi 1999/2001). Sijist\u0101n\u012b, whose writings\nshould be regarded as a spiritual commentary on the gnostic doctrine\npertaining to the flight of the soul toward its paradisal state,\ncenters on the oneness of God, the intellects both Divine and human,\nand different types of souls together with their relationship with the\nbody. In the above mentioned works, Sijist\u0101n\u012b systematically\ntreats notions of creation, the role of prophets as spiritual guides,\nand the hidden symbolism of their teachings. As one goes from the\noutward to the inward and esoteric level of Islam, one gains the\nconsciousness which is the key to understanding the symbolism of\nprophetic teachings. Among other major figures and esoteric mystical\ntexts in this vein is Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101tim R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s\n(811\u2013891 CE) Science of Prophecy (A\u2018l\u0101m\nal-nubuwwah), in which he applies the concept of emanation to the\ncosmological notion of Be (kun) and offers a\nmystical commentary on how human soul is a trace of the higher soul\nthat is perfect.\n\nAlso, one must mention \u1e24am\u012bd al-D\u012bn Kirm\u0101n\u012b\n(d. 996\u20131021 CE) and his numerous writings on Sufism and\ngnosticism, the most notable of which is his Repose of the\nIntellect (R\u0101\u1e25at al-\u2018aql). A prominent\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b philosopher, considered by some as the\n\u201cIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012bs\u2019 Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101,\u201d he argued that an understanding of truth is\nbased on two precepts. First, one has to live a morally virtuous life\nand second, the adept must prepare himself philosophically. The\nchapters of R\u0101\u1e25at al-\u2018aql\nare called aswar (walls) and the paragraphs,\nmash\u0101ri\u2018 (paths). The novice has\nto travel through fifty-six paths within seven walls in order for the\nsoul to gain the knowledge of Reality. Reality, according to\nKirm\u0101n\u012b, is divided into four different levels: first is the\nworld of Divine creation or the incorporeal world\n(\u2018al\u0101m\nal-ibd\u0101\u2018), second, the corporeal\nrealm (\u2018\u0101lam al-jism), third,\nthe domain of religion (\u2018al\u0101m\nal-d\u012bn), and finally, the return of the\nworld to its original unity with God (Baumstark 1932; Corbin 1961;\nCorbin 1964, 130\u20131; Hunzai 1986).\n\nPerhaps the most important figure of the\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012bs tradition, one who was both poet and\nphilosopher, is N\u0101\u1e63ir-i Khusraw (1004\u2013c.1072 CE).\nWhether in his collection of mystical and didactic poems known as\nDiv\u0101n, or his mystically oriental works such as The\nSum of the Two Wisdoms (J\u0101mi\u2018\nal-\u1e25ikmattay\u012bn) and Knowledge and Liberation\n(Gush\u0101yesh wa rah\u0101yesh), he relentlessly offers\nadvice on the catharsis of the soul and the pursuing of the spiritual\njourney. N\u0101\u1e63ir-i Khusraw\u2019s attempt to reconcile\nSufism and reason is seen in his The Sum of the Two Wisdoms,\nwhere he argues that the \u201csages of real religion\u201d\n(\u1e25ukam\u0101y-i d\u012bn-i \u1e25aqq) and the\nphilosophers are in agreement. For N\u0101\u1e63ir-i Khusraw, the\nscience of the soul is the way to attain real knowledge, knowledge\nwhich transcends the difference between the perceiver and perception.\nHe writes:\n\nBetween the knower and the known.\n\nThere lies a distinction by one who\n\nHas awakened from sleep of heedlessness.\n\n\nN\u0101\u1e63ir-i Khusraw offers specific instructions how a novice\nshould follow the spiritual path, relying on specific ascetic\npractices. Similar to the figures of St. Augustine and St. Francis of\nAssisi, N\u0101\u1e63ir-i Khusraw pursued a hedonistic lifestyle in\nthe early part of his life but underwent a spiritual metamorphosis and\ndedicated himself to the Sufi path. Echoes from both phases of his\nlife can be seen through out his works (Hunsburger 2000).\n\nThere are also several encyclopedic works of the\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b tradition whose authors are unknown.\nMany of these deal with mystical and Sufi ideas. Among the works that\nhave been influential in the spread of gnostic ideas are treatises\nlike Brethren of Purity (Ikhw\u0101n\nal-\u1e63af\u0101) and The Mother of Books (Umm\nal-kit\u0101b) (Daftary 1990; Nasr & Aminrazavi\n1999/2001).\n3. The \u201cPeriod of Philosophical Decline\u201d and the School of Shiraz\n\nTraditionally, historians of philosophy have argued that after\nGhazz\u0101l\u012b in the 11th century CE, philosophical\nactivity in the Persian and Eastern part of the Islamic world was\neclipsed and shifted to Islamic Spain. There are those who attribute\nthis to Ghazz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s scathing attack on the\nphilosophers, but this is mostly a myth. The Islamic world at the time\nwas so large, and the intellectual milieu so rich and diverse, that no\nsingle book could put an end to its philosophy and discursive\nreasoning. While it is true that Peripatetic philosophy suffered a\ntemporary eclipse in Persia, the reason lies in the socio-political\nrealities of the Salj\u016bq dynasty and the Islamic world\u2019s\nstruggle with external forces like the Crusades. Recent\nscholarship,\u00a0such as that by Qasim Kaka'i in\nthe\u00a0Journal of Andishah-yi Dini,\u00a0has revealed that\nthe so called period of philosophical decline\u00a0was actually a\nthriving era of intellectual activity in the Southern part of Persia\nwhere the so called the \u201cSchool of Shiraz\u201d emerged. This\nSchool whose salient feature was to synthesis rationalism, mysticism,\nintellectual intuition and even popular Sufism was undoubtedly the\nprecursor to the School of Isfahan.\u00a0\n\nAmong the great masters of philosophical mysticism hailing from Spain,\nIbn Masarrah (883\u2013931 CE) stands out. He was an ascetic whose\nviews on the mystic quest for unity of the soul with God comprised a\nmajor theme in his philosophical mysticism. Others include Ibn\n\u1e24azm (994\u20131064), who emphasized mystical love,\nIbn-B\u0101jjah (1095\u20131138 CE) who treated the concept of\nintellectual and mystical intuition as the faculty that experiences\nDivine realities, Ibn Al-Sid of Badajoz (1052\u20131127 CE) who\ndeveloped what some have called mathematical mysticism, and\nIbn-\u1e6cufayl (c. 1105\u20131185 CE), whose mystical allegory\nSon of the Living Awake (\u1e24ayy ibn Yaqz\u0323\u0101n)\nand his concept of Active Intellect, made him a major exponent of\nmysticism in the Islamic philosophical tradition. Finally there is the\nSufi philosopher, Ibn Sab\u2018\u012bn (1217\u20131268 CE) who made\nan effort to bring about a rapprochement between philosophy and Sufism\nin a systematic treatment of mystical themes.\n\nDespite the significance of the above figures, none of them reached\nthe eminence of the greatest master of gnostic and philosophical\nSufism, Shaykh Mu\u1e25y\u012b al-D\u012bn Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b\n(1165\u20131240 CE) often referred to Shaykh al-Akbar (The Great\nMaster). Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, whose encyclopedic works, The\nBezels of Wisdom (Fu\u1e63\u016b\u1e63 al-h\u0323akam)\nand Meccean Victories (Futu\u1e25\u0101t\nal-Makkiyah), provide us with one of the most complex mystical\nparadigms in the Islamic mystical genre. Often referred to as the\n\u201cDoctrine of the Unity of Being\u201d (wahdat\nal-w\u016bj\u016bd), Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b\u2019s philosophical\nmysticism offers a vast synthesis of gnostic and Sufi ideas as well as\na type of philosophical discourse which, for the first time,\nformulates the Sufi doctrine. With Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, we see a\nmonumental effort to comment on a full array of metaphysical,\ncosmological, and psychological aspects of Gnosticism, thereby\nproviding a vision of reality whose attainment requires the practice\nof the Sufi path. Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b\u2019s philosophico-mystical\nedifice is a process of spiritual hermeneutics\n(ta\u2019w\u012bl) which relies on the language of symbolism\nto guide a novice from the exterior (\u1e93\u0101hir) to the\ninterior (b\u0101\u1e6din). For Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, the\nentire cosmos represents signs (ay\u0101t) which lend\nthemselves to symbolic exegesis, a process whose pinnacle is the\nUniversal Man (al-ins\u0101n al-k\u0101mil). Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b, whose doctrine of the Unity of Being\n(wa\u1e25dat al-w\u016bj\u016bd) has been interpreted by\nmany to be pantheism, was nevertheless careful to argue that even\nthough God dwells in things, but the world \u201cis not\u201d in\nGod. For Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, humans are microcosms and the universe\nis the macrocosm; the Universal Man is the one who realizes all of his\ninherent potentialities, including the Divine breath which was blown\ninto man by God in the beginning of creation as the Qur\u2019an says.\nFor Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, it is the spiritual realization of God\nwithin the soul that leads to union with God (see Nasr 1964; Chittick\n1989 and 2007).\n\nIn the 12th century CE, during the so called \u201cperiod\nof decline\u201d of philosophical activities, the most notable figure\nwas the philosopher-mystic, Shaykh Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn\nSuhraward\u012b, the founder of the School of Illumination\n(Ishr\u0101q). Suhraward\u012b, who was a Peripatetic, wrote\nfour major works, primarily in the Aristotelian tradition. He also\nwrote a number of works in a peculiar esoteric tradition, using what\nhe called \u201cthe language of illumination\u201d (lis\u0101n\nal-ishr\u0101q). In his illuminationist writings, Suhraward\u012b\nrelies on Neoplatonism but replaces such concepts as being and\nexistence with light and illumination, thus offering what can be\ncalled a gnostic-illuminationist version of Avicennian philosophy\n(Aminrazavi 2003). He offers his doctrine of illumination in his major\nwork, The Philosophy of Illumination (\u1e24ikmat\nal-ishr\u0101q).\n\nIn his Sufi writings, Suhraward\u012b employs both allegory and\ndidactic language to advise the novice how to follow the Sufi path,\noften with specific instructions regarding ascetic practices.\nPractical wisdom constitutes an inseparable component of the\nishr\u0101q\u012b doctrine, so much so that in the\nintroduction to his magnum opus, The Philosophy of\nIllumination, Suhraward\u012b warns the reader that the secrets\nof the book will remain hidden to the reader unless he fasts for forty\ndays and avoids consuming meat. Suhraward\u012b, similar to Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b, uses symbolism from nature and animals to offer a\nspiritual hermeneutic (ta\u2019w\u012bl) which begins with\ndiscursive philosophy but ends in gnosis and the spiritual return of\nman to his original abode.\n\nSuhraward\u012b is also credited with having advocated an\nepistemological theory known as \u201cknowledge by presence\u201d\n(\u2018ilm al-\u1e25u\u1e0dur\u012b), in which knowledge\nis attained directly and experientially when the knower, known, and\nthe epistemic relation become one and the same (Yazdi 1992).\nSuhraward\u012b\u2019s works on Sufism, most of which are written in\nPersian, include The Red Intellect (\u2018Aql-i\nsurkh), The Chant of Gabriel\u2019s Wing\n(\u0100waz-i par-i Jibr\u0101\u2019\u012bl), Story of\nthe Occidental Exile (Qi\u1e63\u1e63at al-ghurbat\nal-gharbiyyah), Language of the Termites (Lughat-i\nmur\u0101n), Treatise on the State of Childhood\n(Ris\u0101lah fi \u1e25\u0101lat al-\u1e6dufuliyyah), A\nDay Among the Sufis (Ruz\u012b b\u0101 jam\u0101\u2018at-i\n\u1e63ufiy\u0101n), The Sound of the Griffin\n(Safir-i simurg), Treatise of the Nocturnal Ascent\n(Ris\u0101lah fi\u2019l-mi\u2018r\u0101j), and Treatise\nof Illumination (Partaw-n\u0101mah) (Aminrazavi 1994).\n\nSuhraward\u012b\u2019s illuminationist philosophy has influenced many\nphilosophers who wrote major commentaries on gnostic and Sufi texts,\namong whom are Qutb al-D\u012bn Shir\u0101z\u012b (1236\u20131311\nCE), Mu\u1e25ammad Shahrazur\u012b (d. 1153 CE), and Ibn Turkah\nI\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b (c. 1362\u20131433 CE) Following\nSuhraward\u012b there is an even closer nexus between philosophy and\nmysticism. A number of rationalistic philosophers who adhered to Sufi\nideas and often practiced Sufism, became exponents of philosophical\nmysticism. The post Suhraward\u012ban philosopher-mystics, who\ncontinued to refine the rapprochement between philosophy and\nmysticism, have come to be known as the \u201cSchool of\nShir\u0101z.\u201d\n\nRecent scholarship, such as that by Qasim Kaka'i in\nthe\u00a0Journal of Andishah-yi Dini,\u00a0has revealed that\nwhat has traditionally been regarded as the period of decline of\nphilosophical activities in Persia was, after all, a very thriving\nperiod in philosophical activities in the Southern part of Persia.\nBetween 11th\u201316th century, Shiraz became\nthe center of Sufi and gnostic thought in Persia. Beginning with\nQu\u1e6db al-D\u012bn Shir\u0101z\u012b, who wrote a major commentary\non Suhraward\u012b\u2019s Philosophy of Illumination in\nattempt to clarify Suhraward\u012b\u2019s illuminative thought, the\nSchool of Shiraz produced a number of philosopher-Sufis. Qu\u1e6db\nal-Din Shir\u0101z\u012b\u2019s successor, M\u012br \u1e62adr\nal-D\u012bn Dashtak\u012b (1424 CE) dealt with the problem of\nexistence and the question of its principality. Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn\nDaw\u0101n\u012b (1427 CE), another philosopher of this tradition,\nwrote on the exoteric subjects like law as well as esoteric matters.\nHis work on the relationship between Sufism, ethics, and\nilluminationist thought entitled Sparks of Illumination in the\nVirtues of Ethics (Law\u0101mi\u2018 al-ishr\u0101q f\u012b\nmak\u0101rim al-akhl\u0101q), also knows as Jalalian Ethics\n(Akhl\u0101q-\u012b Jal\u0101l\u012b ) is of particular\nimportance. This work is still used today by Sufi masters as a\npractical guide on how spiritual ethics can cleanse the soul.\nDaw\u0101n\u012b also wrote a number of commentaries on\nSuhraward\u012b\u2019s philosophy of illumination, such as Forms\nof Brightness Concerning the Temples of Light (Shaw\u0101kil\nal-\u1e25ur f\u012b shar\u1e25 hay\u0101kil al-n\u016br). The\nnext philosopher-mystic belonging to the School of Shir\u0101z is\nGhiy\u0101th al-D\u012bn Man\u1e63ur Dashtak\u012b (b.1461), the\noldest son of \u1e62adr al-D\u012bn Dashtak\u012b and the greatest\ngnostic philosopher of this period. Called a \u201cone man\nuniversity,\u201d he was well versed in law and jurisprudence as well\nas theoretical Sufism. Notable among his many works is his\nStations of Wisdom (Maq\u0101m\u0101t\nal-\u2018\u0101rif\u012bn), a profoundly gnostic work which came\nto symbolize the spirit of the School of Shir\u0101z. Dashtak\u012b\nhere presents a rich esoteric commentary on the verses of the\nQur\u2019an, the \u1e25adith and the sayings of such Sufi masters as\n\u1e24all\u0101j (858\u2013922 CE), R\u016bm\u012b (1207\u20131273\nCE), and \u1e24\u0101fiz (1320\u20131388 CE) among others, providing\nthe reader with an understanding of how the love of God can lead to\nthe transcendental unity of being. The influence of Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b is quite evident in this piece. Once again\nrapprochement between peripatetic philosophy,\nishr\u0101q\u012b doctrine, theology, and gnosticism\n(\u2018irf\u0101n) is made in order to help the seeker of\ntruth find his path through the maze of spiritual pitfalls.\n\nAmong other philosophers of this period not necessarily affiliated\nwith the School of Shir\u0101z, but interested in Sufism, are\nNa\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn \u1e6c\u016bs\u012b (1201\u20131274)\nwho wrote a work on Sufi ethics entitled Description of\nNobles (Aw\u1e63\u0101f al-ashr\u0101f), as well as\nAfd\u2019al al-D\u012bn K\u0101sh\u0101n\u012b (d. 1213), a Sufi poet\nand philosopher. The latter was a strict Aristotelian who wrote\nextensive commentary on logic and other aspects of Aristotelian\nthought. While the majority of his fifty-two works are philosophical\nin nature, K\u0101sh\u0101n\u012b sees the task of philosophy to be\nthe facilitation of \u201cfollowing the path of God,\u201d as the\ntitle of one of his works suggests. His commentary on Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b, his references to other gnostics and Sufis, and his\nmystical poetry, have identified him more as a Sufi than a\nrationalistic philosopher. Writing quatrains in the style of Omar\nKhayyam (1048\u20131131), it is in his poetry that Sufism is most\napparent. In a quatrain he says,\n\nO pure Sufi seeking God,\n\nHe has no place, from where do you seek him\n\nIf you do know Him, why do you seek Him?\n\nIf you don\u2019t know Him, whom are you seeking? (Chittick 2001)\n\n\nMoving from Persia to India, in the 11th century CE., when\nthe Persian dynasty of Ghaznavids began to rule in India,\nphilosophical mysticism and the practice of Sufism became popular\namong the Indian Muslim philosophers. Among the central figures of\nthis movement are Shaykh Yousef Gardi\u012b Mult\u0101n\u012b, Shaykh\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl Lahor\u012b, Im\u0101m \u1e24asan\nSan\u2018\u0101n\u012b, and Shaykh Abu\u2019l-\u1e24asan\n\u2018Al\u012b Hujwa\u012br\u012b, the philosopher-Sufi and the\nauthor of Unveiling of the Veiled (Kashf\nal-ma\u1e25j\u016bb). At that time, the\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b missionaries, who had spread the gnostic\ninterpretation of Islam in India had already created a receptive\nintellectual milieu for the Sufi and gnostic ideas. By the\n14th century CE., due to the migration of Persian\nphilosophers and their students to northern India, the more mystically\noriented philosophy of the above figures gained popularity in India as\nwell.\n\nWithin the next two centuries, despite the rise and fall of several\ndynasties, the patronage of philosophers in India in general did not\nchange. Sufi patronage reached a new high during the Mongol period,\nwhose rulers were particularly keen in the Sufi tradition in all its\nmanifestations; especially philosophy, poetry and the visual arts.\nSuch notable Persian philosophers as Taftaz\u0101n\u012b (c.\n1322\u20131390 CE) and Jurj\u0101n\u012b (1097\u20131127 CE) went to\nIndia at this time. They were followed by such figures as M\u012br\nFat\u1e25 All\u0101h Shir\u0101z\u012b, who reformed the educational\ncurriculums to emphasize the teachings of the mystical philosophies of\nhis Persian teachers.\n\nPhilosophical mysticism continued in the Islamic philosophical\ntradition of northern India in figures such as Kh\u0101wjah\nMu\u1e25ammad Baq\u012b bi\u2019ll\u0101h (b.1563), a celebrated\nmystic and the founder of Naqshband\u012b Sufi order, as well as in\nhis student Shaykh A\u1e25mad Sirhind\u012b (1564\u20131624), the\nproponent of the doctrine of \u201cThe Unity of Consciousness\u201d\n(wa\u1e25dat al-shuh\u016bd) and the author of\nEpistoles (Maktub\u0101t). Other Muslim philosophers\nfrom the Indo-Pakistani continent who incorporated mysticism were\nMull\u0101 \u2018Abd al-\u1e24ak\u012bm Siyalkot\u012b, Mull\u0101\nMa\u1e25m\u016bd Junpur\u012b Faruq\u012b, and M\u012brz\u0101\nMu\u1e25ammad Z\u0101hid Haraw\u012b (1603\u20131652), who became\nthe proponent of Suhraward\u012b\u2019s illuminationist philosophy;\nand, perhaps the most well known philosopher-mystic, Sh\u0101h\nWaliull\u0101h, who lived in the 18th century CE.\nWaliull\u0101h made an attempt to reconcile\nIbn-\u2018Arab\u012b\u2019s doctrine of \u201cThe Unity of\nBeing\u201d (wa\u1e25dat al-w\u016bj\u016bd) and\nSirhind\u012b\u2019s doctrine of \u201cThe Unity of\nConsciousness\u201d (wa\u1e25dat al-shuh\u016bd). In\naddition to his numerous writings on the foundation of Sufi\nmetaphysics, Sh\u0101h Waliull\u0101h should be given credit for\nbringing legitimacy to mystical doctrine despite the attacks of\northodox jurists who saw Sufism as heretical.\n4. The School of Isfahan and Mulla Sadra\n\nBack in Persia, came the advent of the Safavid dynasty in the\n16th century CE, the founders of which were practicing\nSufis affiliated with the grand Sufi master, \u1e62af\u012b\nal-D\u012bn Ardab\u012bl\u012b (1252\u20131334 CE). There the use of\nSufi doctrine, philosophy, and asceticism within a single\nphilosophical paradigm reached its pinnacle. The most important issue\nof what came to be called the \u201cSchool of Isfahan\u201d was the\n\u201creality of being\u201d (\u1e25aqiqat\nal-w\u016bj\u016bd ) as opposed to the \u201cconcept of\nbeing\u201d (mafh\u016bm al-w\u016bj\u016bd).\n\nThe founder of the School of Isfahan, M\u012br D\u0101m\u0101d (d.\n1631 or 1632 CE), was a follower of Suhraward\u012b\u2019s philosophy\nof illumination, even choosing the pen name ishr\u0101q\n(illumination). He not only wrote extensively on the metaphysical\nfoundation of mysticism in his major work Sparks of Fire\n(al-Qabas\u0101t), and in his Ecstasies\n(Al-Jadhaw\u0101t), Heavenly Mystical States\n(Khalsat al-malak\u016bt), and his Disassociations\n(al-Khl\u2018iyy\u0101t), he also wrote mystical poetry.\nEven though M\u012br D\u0101m\u0101d wrote extensively on peripatetic\nphilosophy, and especially the concept of time, he is to be credited\nwith a gnostic interpretation of Avicennan philosophy. His\nphilosophico-mystical structure, based on the principality of essence,\nprovides the intellectual frame work for the ascendance of the soul\nand its eventual unity with its source.\n\nIt was however, his student \u1e62adr al-D\u012bn Shir\u0101z\u012b,\nknown as Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, who is perhaps the greatest\nmetaphysician of the Islamic philosophical tradition. His grand\nsynthesis of discursive philosophy, intellectual intuition, and\nasceticism came to be known as the \u201cTranscendental\nTheo-Sophy\u201d (al-\u1e25ikmat\nal-muta\u2018\u0101liyah). This philosophical perspective,\naccording to Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, was unveiled to him by God\nafter many years of inner purification. With Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101, an attempt to offer a spiritual commentary\n(ta\u2019w\u012bl) from a Shi\u2018ite gnostic perspective\non the Qur\u2019an and the concept of \u201cspiritual\nguardianship\u201d (wil\u0101yah) reaches its pinnacle.\n\nHis magnum opus, The Four Journeys of the Intellect\n(al-Asf\u0101r al-arba\u2018\u0101t al-\u2018aqliyyah) is a\nphilosophical and gnostic exposition of the highest caliber, in which\nthe descending and ascending journey of the soul from and to God is\ntreated in detail. This work, which is an encyclopedia of gnosis,\nphilosophy, and mysticism, incorporates much of what Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b and other philosopher-mystics had brought forth to\ndate. For Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, creation represents four\njourneys: the Fall, in which unity becomes multiplicity is the first,\nfollowed by one\u2019s earthly journey wherein the pain of separation\ncauses an existential yearning towards one\u2019s original abode.\nAccording to Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, man\u2019s spiritual\nascendance through the path of Sufism and gnosticism constitutes the\nthird part of this journey until unity once again is accomplished.\nFinally there is the sojourn in the Divine realm, from Truth\n(\u1e25aqq) to Truth, a station only few of the spiritual\nelites may ever experience.\n\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 can be regarded as the reviver of the\nauthentic mystical wisdom to be attained through mysticism and the\nintellectual intuition not divorced from rationality. Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101 makes extensive use of logical analyses and\ndemonstrative proofs, which rest on what he calls \u201cilluminative\nprinciple\u201d (q\u0101\u2018idah ishraqiyyah); that is,\nwhat has entered the heart (al-varid\u0101t al-qalbiyyah), or\n\u201cDivinely realized knowledge\u201d (ta\u1e25q\u012bq\n\u2018arsh\u012b).\n\nSome works that are indicative of his commitment to philosophical\nmysticism are, Metaphysical Penetrations\n(al-Mash\u0101ri\u2018), Wisdom of the Throne\n(\u1e24ikmat al-\u2018arshiyah), The Unity of the\nKnower and the Known (Itti\u1e25\u0101d al-\u2018\u0101qil\nwa\u2019l-ma\u2018q\u016bl), and Secrets of the\nQur\u2019anic Verses (Asr\u0101r al-\u0101y\u0101t), a\ngnostic commentary on the famous light verses.\n\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 left an indelible mark upon Islamic\nphilosophy, and especially on the nexus between philosophy and\nmysticism, making the integration of mysticism an assumed part of\nphilosophizing. His students carried out his philosophical legacy well\ninto the modern era. \u2018Abd al-Razz\u0101q L\u0101hij\u012b (d.\n1661\u20131662 CE) wrote a commentary upon The Secrets of the\nGarden (Shar\u1e25-i gulshan-i r\u0101z), which is a\ndetailed exposition of the spiritual path and one\u2019s journey\nthrough the maze of the states and stations of the Sufi path, M\u012br\nFindirisk\u012b (d. 1640\u201341 CE) wrote a mystical commentary upon\nYoga Vaishishe, and Mull\u0101 Mu\u1e25sin Fay\u1e0d\nK\u0101sh\u0101n\u012b (d. 1680 CE) wrote a mystical treatise entitled\nThe Hidden Words (Kalim\u0101t-i maknunah) as well\nas Divine Gnosis (al-Ma\u2018\u0101rif\nal-il\u0101hiyyah). Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b Sa\u2018id Qumm\u012b\n(d. 1696 CE), another student of Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 and a\nstanch Neoplatonist authored a number of mystical treatises such as\nthe Secrets of Worships (Asr\u0101r\nal-\u2018ib\u0101d\u0101t) as well as a major gnostic work\ntitled Commentary Upon The Enneads (Ta\u2018liq\u0101t\nbar Uth\u016bl\u016bjiy\u0101), scil. The pseudo-Aristotelian\nTheology of Aristotle, derived from the Enneads of\nPlotinus. (See infra The Theology of Aristotle by Peter\nAdamson.)\n\nThe above works, all of which are continuations of \u1e62adrian\nphilosophy, further elaborate the fine points of transcendentalist\ntheo-sophy, which was firmly based on the principality of existence\nover essence, gradation, and the oneness that appears as multiplicity.\nThe question is how to transcend the world of objects which appears as\nmany, to see the Oneness which lies at the heart of multiplicity. The\npost Suhraward\u012ban and Sadrian answer is that a combination of\npractical wisdom and intellectual intuition which transcends\ndiscursive reasoning, provides one with the vision to see the Oneness\nlying at the heart of multiplicity.\n5. The Case of R\u016bm\u012b\n\nMu\u1e25ammad Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn Balkh\u012b, better known as\n\u201cR\u016bm\u012b,\u201d is regarded by many to be one of the\ngreatest Sufi poets of the Islamic tradition. In his magnum opus,\nMathnaw\u012b, which has been called by some\n\u201cThe Persian Qur\u2018an,\u201d R\u016bm\u012b scorns\ndiscursive thought and ridicules philosophers for walking on wobbly\nstilts:\n\nRationalists\u2019 legs are just like stilts;\n\nHow unfixed and stolid are feet of wood! (Nicholson, I: 2127)\n\n\nNevertheless, he became an influential figure in the tradition of\npost-Avicennian philosophical Sufism.\n\nR\u016bm\u012b\u2019s critique of Peripatetic philosophy is closer to\nGhazz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s critique of rationalism than an outright\nrejection of it. Advocating \u201cepistemological humility,\u201d\nR\u016bm\u012b offers a critique of such traditional epistemological\ntheories as truth by correspondence, authority, and reasoning while\nallowing for a more experiential aspect of truth.\n\nIn his Mathnaw\u012b, R\u016bm\u012b criticizes the\nreliability of truth claims based on sensory perception as well:\n\nAll the senses of man are impermanent\n\nFor in the presence of the light of the Day of Resurrection\nthey\u2019re naught.\n\nThe light of the senses and spirits of our fathers\n\nIs not totally evanescent and naught like plants (Nicholson, IV:\n431\u201333)\n\n\nWhile the senses provide us with some knowledge, it is not a type of\nknowledge that can lead to the discovery of spiritual and existential\ntruth.\n\nR\u016bm\u012b also rejects the idea of \u201ctruth by\nauthority\u201d and alludes to the dangers of blindly following those\nwho claim to know the truth. His critique is particularly aimed at\nMuslim jurists who adhere to the Divine command theory.\n\nA myriad servile conformists who follow conjecture\n\nAre cast down into the lowest depths, struck by scruples.\n\nFor the speculative following of precedent and logical supposition\n\nIs their foundation and the very feather and wing of their flight.\n\nTheir inner devil arouses doubts and specious arguments in them\n\nTill benightedly they plummet headlong down like blind folk\n(Nicholson, IV: 2125\u201327)\n\n\nAs to the application of reason, which is at the heart of\nphilosophical enterprise, R\u016bm\u012b divides the intellect into\nuniversal intellect (\u2018aql-i kull\u012b) and particular\nintellect (\u2018aql-i juz\u2019\u012b). Whereas the\nuniversal\u00a0intellect attends to the affairs of the Divine realm,\nthe particular intellect\u2019s scope is restricted to this world. In\nresponse to the Muslim rationalists (Mu\u2018tazilites),\nR\u016bm\u012b states:\n\nThe difference among intellects was intrinsic in origin \u2013\n\nYou should hear the doctrine according to the traditionalists\n\n\u2014Contrary to the opinion of the Mu\u2018tazilites,\n\nWho maintain all intellects in their origin were basically equal,\n\nBut by experience and learning, minds increase or decrease\n\nSo one is made more knowledgeable than the other one \u2013\n\nTheir doctrine is false because even a boy\u2019s counsel\n\nWho has no experience in any course of action\n\n\u2014From that young child a thought will spring up\n\nWhich a wise old sage with manifold experience has no inkling\n(Nicholson, III: 1539\u201343)\n\n\nAnd again R\u016bm\u012b asserts:\n\nThe animal man who by deceit and cunning knows\u2026\n\nThe intricacies of the science of geometry\n\nOr astronomy, medicine and philosophy\n\nWhich are concerned with this world\n\nIs barred from finding the way to seventh heaven.\n\nAll those sciences are fit for building a stable;\n\nThey serve as columns for the abode of camels and cows.\n\nTheir purpose is but to let the animal survive a day or two\n\nAnd yet these imbeciles call those sciences \u201cmysteries\u201d\n(Nicholson, IV: 1519\u20131516)\n\n\nHaving criticized theories of truth by correspondence, authority, and\nreasoning, R\u016bm\u012b advocates a more existential understanding\nof truth which he, along with many Islamic Philosophers, refer to as\nthe universal intellect. He tells us:\n\nThe other intellect is a gift from God,\n\nWhose source is like a spring within the soul.\n\nWhen the water of knowledge gushes forth from the heart,\n\nIt neither becomes fetid, grows old nor wilts.\n\nIf its path where it flows is blocked, why worry?\n\nFor like a spring it gushes forth from the house constantly.\n\nThe acquired intellect is like a water sluice\n\nRunning down into houses from the hills;\n\nIf the path of water is obstructed, it\u2019s undone:\n\nSeek the spring from within yourself (Nicholson, IV: 1964\u201368)\n\n\nPhilosophers\u2019 reliance on reason alone clashes with the validity\nof knowledge by intuition and divine revelation according to\nR\u016bm\u012b:\n\nThe philosopher through thought and surmise is in denial \u2013\n\nTell him go and smash his head against this wall.\n\nThe language of water, of earth and mire\n\nIs comprehensible to the senses of the heart\u2019s adepts.\n\nThe philosopher who is sceptical about the moaning\n pillar[1]\n\nIs himself estranged from the senses of the sages.\n\nSuch things are, he says, but a reflection of melancholic passions\n\nWhich generate these wild fantasies in people\u2019s heads\n(Nicholson, I: 3278\u201381)\n\n\nWhere R\u016bm\u012b and some philosophers agree upon is the existence\nof the very faculty of intuition, which is often associated with the\nuniversal intellect. According to R\u016bm\u012b, this faculty, which\nmust be \u2018awakened\u2019 by practicing the arduous process of\nthe mystical path, leads to the awakening of the five internal\nspiritual senses that complement the five external\nphysical senses. All the ten senses are controlled by the symbolic\n\u201cheart\u201d\u2014the organ of supersensory perception.\n\n\nThere are five [spiritual] senses besides these five [physical] senses\n\nThe former are like red gold and the latter like copper.\n\nIn the marketplace where the expert connoisseurs are busy\n\nHow should the copper and golden senses be priced the same?\n\nThe physical senses\u2019 nutriment is murky and tenebrous;\n\nThe spiritual sense sups and dines on the sun (Nicholson, II:\n49\u201351)\n\nBe silent, be silent, drink silently.\n\nVeil yourself, veil yourself for you are the hidden treasure.\n\nSpeak not, speak not of this exposition of my heart\n\nSo you be not bewildered, so you do not remain perplexed\n\n(Kulliy\u0101t-i Shams, vol. 2, ghazal 637, vv. 6649,\n6653)\n\n\nR\u016bm\u012b\u2019s impact on Islamic philosophy can be seen in\nvarious commentaries on philosophical gnosticism that were influenced\nby R\u016bm\u012b\u2019s works. The tradition of writing commentaries\nor quoting R\u016bm\u012b, which appears in the works of Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101, L\u0101hij\u012b, and Sabziw\u0101r\u012b continues\nwell into the modern era.\n6. Conclusion\n\nEven though post Sadrian philosophy in the Islamic tradition never\nreached the level of accomplishment of the great masters of the\nSafavid period, Sadra\u2019s school of metaphysics found followers in\nthe periods that were to follow, both in and outside of Persia. While\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s influence was marginal in the Arab\nworld, which has generally seemed to distance itself from traditional\nmetaphysical issues, in India, \u1e62adrian philosophy was well\nreceived and it is taught in traditional schools today.\n\nWith the advent of the Q\u0101j\u0101r dynasty in Iran in the early\n18th century CE., \u1e62adrian philosophy once again\nbecame the focal point of philosophical activity. The greatest\nproponents of gnosis and philosophical mysticism in this period came\nto be known as the \u201cSchool of Tehran.\u201d This school\nincluded Mull\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b Nur\u012b (d. 1830\u20131 CE)\nwhose Glosses upon the Secrets of Verses is an esoteric\ncommentary on certain verses of the Qur\u2019an, Mull\u0101\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl Kh\u0101ju\u2018\u012b (d. 1759 CE), who\nwrote on the concept of time within a gnostic context, and the most\ncelebrated figure in this period, \u1e24\u0101jj Mull\u0101\nH\u0101d\u012b Sabziw\u0101r\u012b (1797\u20131873 CE) whose\nCommentary on Treatises (Shar\u1e25-i\nman\u1e93umah) is a compendium of philosophical gnosticism.\nSabziw\u0101r\u012b, who also wrote mystical poetry under the pen-name\nAsr\u0101r (Secrets), brought about a rapprochement\namong many different strands of mystical philosophy and considered\nasceticism to be a central part of living a philosophical life. With\nSabziw\u0101r\u012b\u2019s death in 1797 CE., Tehran became the\ncenter of philosophical activity, much of which centered around the\nphilosophy of Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 and Sabziw\u0101r\u012b. The\nsalient features of the School of Tehran were that knowledge is\nhierarchical in essence and that discursive philosophy, while useful,\nis ultimately limited. In this tradition, it is through intellectual\nintuition, illumination, and inner purification that the reality of\nexistence can be experienced (Sabzav\u0101r\u012b 1969;\nAshtiy\u0101n\u012b 1973) . Among other masters of this period are\nMull\u0101 \u2018Abdall\u0101h Zunuz\u012b (d. 1841\u201342 CE), the\nauthor of Divine Flashes of Light (al-Lama\u2018\u0101t\nal-il\u0101hiyyah), and his son, Mull\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b\nZunuz\u012b (d. 1889\u20131900 CE), who authored Marvels of\nWisdom (Bad\u0101yi\u2018 al-h\u0323ikam). Both of\ntheir works are gnostic and mystical commentaries upon a wide range of\nphilosophical problems. Because the School of Tehran was dominated by\ngrand scholars who were also jurists, it continued in the\n\u1e62adrian and Sabziw\u0101rian tradition, but distanced itself\nfrom popular Sufism, with whom they identified relaxed attitude and\neven antinomian tendencies towards Islamic law\n(Shari\u2018ah). Emphasis on piety, asceticism, and\ncleansing of the soul within the prescribed limits of the\nShari\u2018ah, perhaps partially a reaction to modernity, is\nthe salient feature of the School of Tehran.\n\nThe number of Muslim philosophers who became proponents of mystical\nphilosophy in the Islamic world are too numerous to mention here, but\nclearly mysticism is a living tradition that continues to occupy\ncenter stage in the philosophy in the Muslim world. It is virtually\nimpossible to fully account for all the traditions of mysticism in the\nIslamic philosophical tradition, however such traditions do exist in\nalmost every Muslim country today (see Kili\u00e7 1996).\n\nThe impact of mysticism on Islamic philosophy has been so profound\nthat it has changed the very essence and definition of philosophizing.\nThe enterprise of philosophizing in the Islamic tradition is seen by\nmost not merely as an intellectual exercise but as the intellectual\ndimension of the soul\u2019s spiritual journey towards the unveiling\nof truth. Authentic philosophy, according to Muslim\nphilosopher-mystics is therefore committed to providing a\nrationalistic commentary upon those issues which traditionally\nbelonged to the mystical domain only.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Works", "Secondary Works"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Works": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Ashtiy\u0101n\u012b, Mehdi, 1973. <i>Commentary on\nSabzaw\u0101r\u012b\u2019s \u201cShar\u1e25-i\nman\u1e93umah\u201d</i>, A.
