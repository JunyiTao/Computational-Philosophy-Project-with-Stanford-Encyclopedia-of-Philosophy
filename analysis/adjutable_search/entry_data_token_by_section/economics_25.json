    "main_text": "Economics and ethics || Welfare\n6.1 Welfare\n\nOne central question of moral philosophy has been to determine what\nthings are intrinsically good for human beings. This is a central\nquestion, because all plausible moral views assign an important place\nto individual welfare or\n well-being.\n This is obviously true of utilitarianism (which holds that what is\nright maximizes total or average welfare), but even non-utilitarian\nviews are concerned with welfare, if they recognize the virtue of\nbenevolence, or if they are concerned with the interests of\nindividuals or with avoiding harm to individuals.\n\nThere are many ways to think about well-being, and the prevailing view\namong economists has shifted from hedonism (which takes the good to be\na mental state such as pleasure or happiness) to the view that welfare\nshould be measured by the satisfaction of preferences. A number of\nprominent economists are currently arguing for a return to hedonism,\nbut they remain a minority. (See Bavetta et al. 2014. Clark\nFl\u00e8che 2018, Dolan and Kahneman 2014, Frey 2010, 2018, Frey and\nStutzer 2001, Kahneman 1999, 2000a, 2000b, Kahneman and Krueger 2006,\nKahneman and Sugden 2005, Kahneman and Thaler 2006, Layard 2006,\nOrmerod 2008, Radcliff 2013, Weimann and Knabe 2015 and for criticism\nDavies 2015, Etzioni 2018, and Hausman 2010.) Unlike hedonism, taking\nwelfare to be preference satisfaction specifies how to find out what\nis good for a person rather than committing itself to any substantive\nview of a person\u2019s good. Note that equating welfare with the\nsatisfaction of preferences is not equating welfare with any\nfeeling of satisfaction. If welfare can be measured by the\nsatisfaction of preferences, then a person is better off if what he or\nshe prefers comes to pass, regardless of whether that occurrence makes\nthe agent feel satisfied.\n\nSince mainstream economics attributes a consistent preference ordering\nto all agents, and since more specific models typically take agents to\nbe well-informed and self-interested, it is easy for economists to\naccept the view that an individual agent A will prefer\nX to Y if and only if X is in fact better\nfor A than Y is. This is one place where positive\ntheory bleeds into normative theory. In addition, the identification\nof welfare with the satisfaction of preferences is attractive to\neconomists, because it prevents questions about the justification of\npaternalism (to which most economists are strongly opposed) from even\narising.\n\nWelfare and the satisfaction of preferences may coincide because the\nsatisfaction of preferences constitutes welfare or because people are\nself-interested and good judges of their own interests and hence\nprefer what is good for them. There are many obvious objections to the\nview that the satisfaction of preferences constitutes welfare.\nPreferences may be based on mistaken beliefs. People may prefer to\nsacrifice their own well-being for some purpose they value more\nhighly. Preferences may reflect past manipulation or distorting\npsychological influences (Elster 1983). In addition, if preference\nsatisfaction constitutes welfare, then policy makers can make people\nbetter off by molding their wants rather than by improving conditions.\nFurthermore, it seems unreasonable that social policy should attend to\nextravagant preferences. Rather than responding to these objections\nand attempting to defend the view that preference satisfaction\nconstitutes well-being, economists can blunt these objections by\ntaking preferences in circumstances where people are self-interested\nand good judges of their interests to be merely good evidence of what\nwill promote welfare (Hausman and McPherson 2009, Hausman 2012). There\nare some exceptions, most notably Amartya Sen (1987a,b,c, 1992), but\nmost economists take welfare to coincide with the satisfaction of\npreference.\n",
