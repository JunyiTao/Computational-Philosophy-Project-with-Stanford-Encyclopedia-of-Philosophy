But as noted in\n Section 1,\n some philosophers deny that the special character of self-ascriptions\nis primarily epistemic. One version of this denial charges that by\nfocusing on our access to our mental states, standard\naccounts of self-knowledge portray the introspective thinker as\npassive, a mere spectator (or detector) of a cognitive show.\nAgentialists contend that the special character of self-knowledge\nstems from the fact that we exercise agency over our mental states,\nand hence are responsible for them. \n\n\nThe privilege of first-person knowledge is \u2026 really more like the\nknowledge of a person driving a car as opposed to that of her\npassenger. The passenger may very well see where the driver is going,\nbut still does not know in the immediate executive sense of\nthe driver herself. (McGeer 1996: 505)\n\nThe phenomena of self-knowledge \u2026 are themselves based as much\nin asymmetries of responsibility and commitment as they are in\ndifference in capacities or in cognitive access. (Moran 2001: 64)\n\n\nMany versions of agentialism are inspired by a broadly Kantian\napproach to reason and agency (Burge 1996; Moran 2001; Bilgrami 2006;\nBoyle 2009). On this approach, a thinker\u2019s most basic\nself-conception (as an \u201cI\u201d) is agential: we see ourselves\nas authors of our beliefs and intentions, rather than as an\ninert thing in which attitudes merely occur. This authorial agency is\nessentially rational: it is exercised when we believe or intend on the\nbasis of reasons. Agentialism differs from rationalism in taking our\ncapacity for self-knowledge to derive from our agency and not (just)\nfrom our rationality. Agentialists maintain that our rational agency\nguarantees that we are capable of\u2014or even that we\npossess\u2014self-knowledge.\n\nAgentialists differ as to the precise link between agency and\nself-knowledge. I begin with Burge, who argues that our responsibility\nfor our beliefs entitles us to belief self-ascriptions. Burge\nuses the following reasoning. Our rational agency confers on us the\nobligation to (try to) satisfy certain rational norms: that\none\u2019s beliefs should conform to one\u2019s evidence; that a\nbelief set should be internally consistent; etc. In order to satisfy\nthese rational norms\u2014e.g., to assess our beliefs for conformance\nwith our evidence, or for consistency with other beliefs\u2014we must\nrely on judgments as to which beliefs we have. So our responsibility\nto satisfy rational norms epistemically entitles us to those judgments\nabout our beliefs (and other attitudes) that are crucial for\nsatisfying those norms.\n\n\n[I]f one lacked entitlement to judgments about one\u2019s attitudes,\none could not be subject to rational norms governing how one ought to\nalter those attitudes given that one had reflected on them. (Burge\n1996:\n 101)[9]\n\n\nThis appears to be a version of \u201cought implies can\u201d reasoning. The\nupshot is that being responsible for one\u2019s attitudes requires,\nand thereby implies, that we can know those attitudes. \n\nBurge's reasoning has a distinctly transcendental flavor (see the\nentry on\n transcendental arguments).\n Transcendental reasoning also fuels Moran\u2019s agentialism. But\nwhile Burge uses it to establish a general entitlement to\nself-ascriptions, Moran deploys it to show that self-knowledge can be\nachieved in a specific way, namely by reflection on reasons. He\nreasons as follows. We could not engage in rational thought unless we\nhad the \u201cepistemic right\u201d to the assumption that our attitudes are\nshaped by our reasons. (This is \u201csomething like a Transcendental\nassumption of Rational Thought\u201d (Moran 2003: 406).) So we do\nhave the epistemic right to that assumption. And our right to that\nassumption gives us the epistemic right to use the transparency method\nassociated with Evans\u2019 famous remarks: to answer the question\n\u201cdo you believe that p?\u201d by considering reasons bearing\non p (ibid.) So the self-ascriptions produced by the\ntransparency method constitute knowledge.\n\nMoran\u2019s agentialist transparency account differs markedly from\nempiricist transparency accounts\n (3.4).\n For empiricists, the transparency method provides for self-knowledge\nbecause it is reliable or generates self-ascriptions that could not\neasily be false. For agentialists, our entitlement to use the\ntransparency method is rooted in a normative fact: that we are\nresponsible for our attitudes.\n\nSome worry that Moran\u2019s account is too demanding. O\u2019Brien\nargues that I am not justified in self-attributing the belief that\nthere will be a third world war, on the basis of considering\ngeopolitics, unless I recognize that my reasons for expecting a third\nworld war constitute evidence that I believe it will occur. But this\nrecognition in turn requires a reflective grasp of the nature of\ndeliberation that seems unnecessary for ordinary self-attributions\n(O\u2019Brien 2003: 379\u201381).\n\nOther philosophers have supplemented Moran\u2019s argument by\nclaiming that the agentialist transparency account is needed to make\nsense of various phenomena. Keeling (2018) cites the fact that we\nconfabulate reasons for our attitudes (Nisbett and Wilson 1977) as\nshowing that, as rational agents, we take ourselves to be obligated to\nknow the rational basis for our attitudes, and hence to be justified\nin taking our attitudes to reflect our reasons. Marcus and Schwenkler\n(2019) argue that we cannot satisfy the honesty norm for assertions\nunless we have non-empirical knowledge of what we believe, of the sort\nprovided by the transparency method.\n\nLike Burge and Moran, Bilgrami (2006) regards self-knowledge as\nintimately tied to the phenomenon of rational agency. But his view is\nnot merely that, as rational agents, we are necessarily capable of\nknowing our attitudes. He argues that we could not exercise the agency\ninvolved in believing unless we actually knew our beliefs.\nBeliefs are necessarily known by the thinker because they are\ncommitments.\n\n\n[C]ommitments [such as beliefs] \u2026 are states that, were we not\nto live up to them, we should be prepared to criticize ourselves and\nbe prepared also to try and do better, by way of living up to them\n\u2026 We cannot therefore have commitments without believing that\nwe have them. \u2026 Thus the very condition for having a commitment\npresupposes that one has a second-order belief that one has that\ncommitment. (2006: 287)\n\n\nBoyle also thinks that our responsibility for our attitudes means that\nwe must be generally aware, at least tacitly, of our conscious\nbeliefs. The capacity to deliberate about whether p requires\nan awareness of how p is being represented: e.g., awareness\nthat it is represented as a settled matter, as opposed to a hypothesis\nto be examined (Boyle 2019: 1034). This means that a rational thinker\nwho consciously believes that p has a tacit awareness of that\nbelief. Importantly, for Boyle this awareness is not higher-order: the\nbelief that p is not an object of a separate state\nof awareness. Instead, it is an in-built awareness:\n\n\n[F]or a person who consciously believes that p, being aware\nof her own belief and seeing the world from the perspective of\np-believer are two aspects of the same awareness. (ibid.:\n1018)\n\n\nThe agentialist views discussed thus far have been inspired by the\nKantian idea that we are responsible for our beliefs and intentions\nbecause, in believing or intending, we exercise a distinctive type of\nagency, viz. rational agency. Whether positive this\ndistinctive type of agency is needed to explain the epistemic and\nnormative aspects of self-knowledge invoked by agentialists is a\nmatter of controversy (Gertler 2018; Sorgiovanni 2019).\n\nSome agentialist views are independent of the idea that our attitudes\nare exercises of rational agency. McGeer\u2019s (1996) view, a\npioneer of empiricist agentialism, takes self-ascriptions to be\n\u201ccommissive\u201d: in self-ascribing an attitude, we commit to behaving in\nways that fit that attitude.\n\n\n[W]e are actors as well as observers and so can be good, even\nexcellent, \u201cpredictors\u201d of our future behavior because we\nhave the power to make these \u201cpredictions\u201d come true. \u2026 [W]e do not\njust wait to see if our actions make sense in light of intentional\nself-attributions, but rather make them make sense. (McGeer\n1996: 507)\n\n\nMcGeer\u2019s account does not invoke the idea of rational agency.\nThis means that it does not rest on positing a distinctive agential\nfaculty, and allows its scope to extend beyond reasons-sensitive\nattitudes such as beliefs and intentions. For example, saying (or\njudging) \u201cI want to go to the beach\u201d commits one to act in ways that\nmake sense given that desire: e.g., to go to the beach when an\nopportunity presents itself. The normativity of this commitment stems\nnot from the requirements of rationality but, instead, from our\nordinary practical obligations. In expressing an attitude, we provide\nothers with ways of explaining and predicting our behavior; this\nobligates us to behave in ways that fit the attitudes we express or\nself-ascribe (or to convey that our attitudes have changed). \n\nColiva (2012a) develops a related view concerning self-ascriptions of\ncommitments\u2014which for her include not only beliefs and\nintentions but also rationally held conative attitudes, such as\ndesires. Provided that a thinker is rational and has the relevant\nconcepts, their self-ascriptions of commitments will be true because\nthey will create the attitudes ascribed.\n\n\n[A] judgement (or a sincere assertion) such as \u2028\u201cI\nbelieve/desire/intend/wish/hope that P\u201d is like a\nperformative, namely like \u201cI promise to buy you an\nice-cream\u201d\u2026 : it makes a certain thing happen,\nfor it does create the first-order propositional attitude as a\ncommitment. \u2026 [J]udging \u201cI\nbelieve/desire/intend/wish/hope that P\u201d becomes just an\nalternative way of undertaking the same commitments one would make by\njudging that P (is worth pursuing or having)\u2026 (Coliva\n2012a: 235\u20136)\n\n\nThe agency operative in Coliva\u2019s account is our power to\nundertake commitments through self-ascriptions. This contrasts with\nthe kind of agency at work in Kantian agentialist views, which is\nexercised simply in having beliefs or intentions. However,\nColiva\u2019s account still has a rationalist element in that\nself-ascriptions involve committing to there being good\nreasons for the attitude.\n\nWe now consider the prospects for agentialism generally. The\nagentialist\u2019s primary burden is to explain the epistemic\ndimension of self-knowledge. After all, most cases of knowledge\ninvolve a belief being controlled by what is known: e.g., I know my\ndog\u2019s location only if my belief about his location is\ncontrolled by (sensitive to) his actual location. By contrast, the\nagential approach focuses on our control over what is known.\nAgentialism is not a genuine competitor to the accounts of\nself-knowledge unless it explains how agency relative to our attitudes\nprovides for self-knowledge. (Parrott\u2019s (2015) non-epistemic\nversion of agentialism is explicitly not a competitor to those\naccounts, as its aim is to explain why it is reasonable to defer to\nothers\u2019 self-ascriptions.) Because the various versions of\nagentialism differ as to the way that agency secures justification or\nwarrant for self-ascriptions, their responses to this challenge will\ndiffer.\n\nA possible drawback of agentialism is its limited application. Most\nversions of agentialism apply only to attitudes are sensitive to\nreasons. (McGeer\u2019s is an exception.) But arguably,\nnon-instrumental desires and some other types of attitudes are\ninsensitive to reasons: this is part of the motivation for\nself-interpretation accounts (3.3). And some beliefs and intentions\nare insensitive to reasons. Beliefs that are deeply entrenched (such\nas superstitions) or comforting (as in wishful thinking) sometimes\npersevere in the face of counter-evidence. Intentions that run counter\nto one\u2019s goals (e.g. akratic or self-sabotaging intentions)\nsometimes withstand practical deliberation.\n\nAgentialists generally hold that we can know such recalcitrant\nattitudes, but only through a process of self-observation, which they\nregard as problematic. (McGeer is again an exception.) Agentialists\nargue that if I can know about my own attitude only through\nobservation, then I am \u201calienated\u201d (Moran 2001) from that\nattitude; my relation to it, qua agent, is \u201cbrute, contingent,\nnon-rational\u201d (Burge 1996); and I can view it only from a\n\u201cthird-person perspective\u201d (Bilgrami 2006) and not\n\u201cas my own\u201d (Boyle\n 2009).[10]\n Some of agentialism\u2019s critics maintain that knowing an attitude\nthrough an observational process does not preclude a thinker from\nregarding it as her own in the relevant sense (Reed 2010;\nBorgoni 2015). Some even claim that a detached perspective on\none\u2019s own attitudes can be especially enlightening: it can help\nus to recognize and combat recalcitrant attitudes (McGeer 2008; Levy\n2016), and it may be necessary for genuine self-understanding (Doyle\n2019). \n",
