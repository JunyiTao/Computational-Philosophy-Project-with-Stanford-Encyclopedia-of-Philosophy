    "main_text": "\n\nFriendship, as understood here, is a distinctively personal\nrelationship that is grounded in a concern on the part of each friend\nfor the welfare of the other, for the other\u2019s sake, and that\ninvolves some degree of intimacy. As such, friendship is undoubtedly\ncentral to our lives, in part because the special concern we have for\nour friends must have a place within a broader set of concerns,\nincluding moral concerns, and in part because our friends can help\nshape who we are as persons. Given this centrality, important\nquestions arise concerning the justification of friendship and, in\nthis context, whether it is permissible to \u201ctrade up\u201d when\nsomeone new comes along, as well as concerning the possibility of\nreconciling the demands of friendship with the demands of morality in\ncases in which the two seem to conflict.\n",
