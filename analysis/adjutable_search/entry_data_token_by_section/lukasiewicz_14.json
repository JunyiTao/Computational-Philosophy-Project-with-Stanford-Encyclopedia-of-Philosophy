    "main_text": "Philosophical Positions\n8. Legacy\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz once declared somewhat immodestly that the discovery\nof many-valued logics was comparable to that of non-Euclidean\ngeometries (SW 176). Whatever their significance,\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s hopes for such logics have not been realized\nin the way he anticipated. The semantics and pure mathematics of\nmultivalued logics have flourished, leading to the development of\nMV-algebras in use for the algebraic semantics of\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s logics. Infinite-valued or fuzzy logic has\nits own mathematics, and prominent among its developers is the Czech\nmathematical logician Petr H\u00e1jek, whose work is influenced by\nthat of \u0141ukasiewicz. Fuzzy logic is found in many practical\napplications, where it is used to deal with vagueness, inexactness, or\nlack of knowledge, whether these are the same or different. But\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s championing of multivalence in the analysis\nof modality has been almost universally rejected, and the logic of\nmodality has inexorably followed other paths, mostly bivalent,\nnon-extensional ones. His final logic \u0141 has resisted consensual\ninterpretation, and is regarded as at best an oddity and at worst a\ndead end.\n\nThe outstanding work that \u0141ukasiewicz and his students\naccomplished in the logic and metalogic of propositional calculus, the\nPolish speciality of ever-shorter axioms and so on, now belongs to the\nbygone heroic age of logistic. Its results have indeed only been\nbettered occasionally by automated theorem-provers. On the other hand\nthe emphasis on logical semantics, \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s abundant\nuse of truth-values notwithstanding, has shifted interest away from\naxiomatic virtuosity.\n\nIn the history of logic, \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s pioneering studies\nopened up a new and more fruitful interaction between the past and the\npresent, and the rediscovery and new appreciation of figures from\nlogic\u2019s past \u201cin the light of modern formal logic\u201d\nhas continued to this day, though not all of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\nown views on how to approach Aristotle or the Stoics have stood the\ntest of time. His work also helped to inspire those historians of\nlogic from the Catholic tradition in Krak\u00f3w, most notably Jan\nSalamucha and J\u00f3zef Boche\u0144ski, who applied modern methods\nto the investigation of logical problems and arguments from the\nhistory of philosophy.\n\nDuring the heyday of the Warsaw School, 1920\u20131939,\n\u0141ukasiewicz played a key role in educating the next generation of\nlogical researchers and inspiring them with methods, results and\nproblems. Even ideas he tossed off as exercises have changed logic,\nfor example a 1929 suggestion to formalize the informal procedure of\nproof from assumptions led to Stanis\u0142aw Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s\n1934 system of natural deduction, in essentials the way logic is\nmainly taught to students today. The war irrevocably interrupted their\nwork. Several of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s best students were Jewish,\nand were killed in Nazi death camps. In his exile from Poland after\n1944, \u0141ukasiewicz had scant opportunity to continue this\npedagogical work, holding a research position in a non-teaching\ninstitution in a country with no logical tradition. His interactions\nwith contemporaries were much more sparse, and those chiefly through\ncorrespondence. The one notable logician who interacted with\n\u0141ukasiewicz at this time and whose work intersects with his in\nboth interests (time, modality, many-valuedness) and attitudes (the\nimportance of logic for philosophy) is Arthur Prior, who was the only\nmajor logician to adopt Polish notation, and who also expended more\neffort than anyone in the attempt to find a plausible interpretation\nfor the system \u0141. It is also fair to say that of the major\nfigures among the Warsaw logicians, \u0141ukasiewicz has received the\nleast attention from commentators and historians. There are relatively\nfewer monographs and papers on \u0141ukasiewicz than on other major\nfigures of the Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw School.\n\nDespite such disappointments, \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s achievements\nand inventions ensure him a permanent and honorable place in the\nhistory of mathematical and philosophical logic. \u0141ukasiewicz was\njustly proud of the prominence achieved by Polish logicians between\nthe wars, and fully deserves his commemoration by one of Adam\nMyjak\u2019s four statues of prominent Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw\nSchool members at the entrance to Warsaw University Library.\n",
