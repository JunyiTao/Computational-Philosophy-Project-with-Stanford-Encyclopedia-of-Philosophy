    "main_text": "Ethics and Free Will\n6. Ethics and Free Will\n\nReichenbach\u2019s discussion of free action and free will is an\nattempt to reconcile our judgments that some actions are done freely\nand others are not with a scientific and materialist conception of the\nworld. An action is free if there is a prior circumstance in which a\n\u201cvolition\u201d of the actor causes the action, and in that,\notherwise the same, circumstance a volition to act otherwise would\nwith high probability have brought about a different action.\nReichenbach goes to some lengths to explain just how the volition must\ncause the action in order to be free, but the conditions are open to\nfairly simple counter-examples. He also makes no attempt to relate\nfree action to moral responsibility, or its absence to innocence. \n\nThe Rise of Scientific Philosophy (1951a),\nReichenbach\u2019s last and most successful popular book, presents\nhis broad philosophical viewpoint in an accessible way. The English\nprose is more fluent than in earlier works, and occasionally almost as\npithy as Russell\u2019s. Four chapters of the book provide\nReichenbach\u2019s review of the history of philosophical pretensions\nto a priori knowledge in metaphysics, epistemology and ethics. Writing\nof Kant, Reichenbach instructs: \u201cHis cognitive a priori\ncoincides with the physics of his time; his moral a priori, with the\nethics of his social class. Let this coincidence be a warning to all\nthose who claim to have found the ultimate truth.\u201d (p. 61) Of\nHamlet, Reichenbach writes \u201cTo be or not to be\u2014that is not\na question but a tautology.\u201d (p. 250) Much of the remainder of\nthe book consists of selective popular science summaries, amid\nsimplified restatements of the views in The Philosophy of Space\nand Time (1928h), and Experience and Prediction (1938c).\nThe news in the book is the extended discussion of ethics. In his\ncontribution to the Schilpp volume (1939a) on John Dewey, Reichenbach\nhad written at some length, and with considerable disdain, about\nDewey\u2019s ethical theory. (His personal relations with Dewey are\nunknown to us, but it is possible that Reichenbach knew and\ndisapproved of Dewey\u2019s enthusiasm for World War I.) About\nethics, Reichenbach was at least as pragmatic as Dewey, but about\nmetaethics, and in particular about the logical form of ethical\nsentences, he was in close accord with Charles Leslie\nStevenson\u2019s imperativism. To assert \u201cX is\ngood\u201d is just to assert \u201cI approve of X: Do so as\nwell!\u201d In The Rise of Scientific Philosophy he insists\nthat ethical statements express \u201cvolitional decisions,\u201d\nwithout truth values, that are not subject to empirical knowledge. The\nempirical issues of ethics are only the causal questions of relations\nof means to ends. Reichenbach allows a place for logic in reasoning\nfrom ethical premises to ethical conclusions, but he insists that the\ncharacteristic feature of ethical statements, and the proper\nconclusion of ethical reasoning, is a call to action. Whatever else\nthey are, ethical claims are imperatives. His recommendation for\nresolving fundamental ethical disagreements is not philosophy or\nscience, but \u201csocial friction.\u201d In keeping with his\npolitics, Reichenbach\u2019s last practical advice was the same as\nJoe Hill\u2019s: Organize! But Reichenbach\u2019s deepest ethical\ninjunction was implicit in his most popular book: to form beliefs, to\njudge them, to change them, to weigh actions, to distinguish real from\nmerely verbal differences, by the canons of scientific philosophy.\n\n\nFurther Reading. In a somewhat unusual description of\nReichenbach\u2019s work, McCumber (2016) characterizes The Rise\nof Scientific Philosophy as \u201cCold War philosophy\u201d\nthat prudently avoids the traps of its time.\n",
