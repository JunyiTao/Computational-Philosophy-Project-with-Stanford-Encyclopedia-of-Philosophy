    "main_text": "Other Examples of Replicators || The Immune System\n4.1 The Immune System\n\nDoes replication play the same role in other sorts of selection that\nit plays in gene-based biological evolution? The reaction of the\nimmune system to antigens is closest to the standard biological\nexample of replication and selection (Hull et al. 2001). Certainly,\nimmune systems arose through the same process as other functional\nsystems. The basic structure of the human immune system is\n\u201cbuilt into our genes\u201d, and the only genes that count in\nevolution are the ones that we received from our ancestors and can\nsubsequently pass on to our progeny. In Dawkins\u2019 (1982b: 83)\nterminology, the genes that code for our immune system are active,\ngerm-line replicators. They are active because they influence their\nprobability to be copied; they are germ-line because they can\npotentially have an infinity of descendants.\n\nHowever, the genes that function in the reaction of the immune system\nto antigens have two peculiarities. First, they incorporate mechanisms\ndesigned to produce very high frequencies of mutation; second, none of\nthe genes involved in the functioning of the immune system are\ngerm-line. For instance, the genes that give rise to B-cells are\ndesigned to mutate extensively until one of these cells identifies an\ninvader as foreign. It then proliferates extensively as it attacks the\ninvader. As an organism matures, it accumulates more and more of the\nB-cells that have been successful in its past. More than this, as\nthe process of proliferation continues, the strength of the affinities\nto binding sites increases. Initially, the primary antibodies almost\nalways exhibit a weak affinity for their targets; however, as the\nreaction to the antigen continues, these affinities become\nstronger.\n\nWithin the confines of a single organism, the reaction of the immune\nsystem to antigens has all the characteristics of selection processes;\nhowever, when the organism dies, all of these adaptations are lost. In\nsome species, females pass on not only the genes for the basic\nstructure of their immune systems but also some of the machinery that\npast invasions of antigens have produced in them. However, these cells\nare rapidly removed from the offspring as it develops its own immune\nsystem. The reaction of the immune system to antigens departs from\ngene-based selection in biological evolution in two ways. First, from\nthe organismal perspective, the genes that function in protecting an\norganism from invaders are not germ-line. They are somatic. Second,\nthe relevant mutation rates are much, much higher in the immune system\nthan in ordinary gene-based selection. Instead of mechanisms existing\nto discover mutations and repair them, mechanisms exist that encourage\nmutations\u2014massively so. If the functioning of the immune system\nis to count as an adaptive process, some changes must be made.\nOne possibility is to clarify what counts as a \u201cgerm-line\u201d\nreplicator and reject the notion that extremely low mutation\nrates are inherent in all selection processes [see the section below\non\n Challenges to the Replicator].\n",
