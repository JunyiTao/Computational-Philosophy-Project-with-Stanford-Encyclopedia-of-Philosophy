    "main_text": "Transcendentals and Predication\n3. Transcendentals and Predication\n\n\nThe predication of transcendentals has a logical, ontological, and\nepistemological sense that can be distinguished as follows. In a\nlogical sense, as predicative expressions, \u2018transcendental\nterms\u2019 are outside the range of the five predicables or\nuniversals listed by Porphyry in his Isagoge to\nAristotle\u2019s Categories, i.e. they are not a genus,\nspecies, difference, property, or accident. Their signification is not\nbound to the categorical horizon, and they resist\n\u2018infinitatio\u2019 (for this term, cf. infra). In\nan ontological sense, as properties signified by the predicate of\na proposition that are asserted of the object signified by the subject\nof the proposition, transcendentals are properties that are not\nrestricted to, but run through the classes of things expressed by the\nhighest genera, the categories. In an epistemological sense,\nfinally, as predicative concepts expressed by the predicate of a\nproposition that are connected with the concept expressed by the\nsubject of the proposition into a thought expressed by the proposition\nitself, transcendentals are concepts that cannot be analyzed by taking\nrecourse to a still higher genus and are, therefore, first known,\nself-evident, and primitive.\n\n\nThe predicative context is commonly suggested to be the historical\norigin of the term \u2018transcendens\u2019 in the\nmeaning of \u2018transcendental\u2019. (See Jacobi 2003; Valente\n2007; Aertsen 2012, 42sqq.) Various 12th century logical texts\nrecognize the distinctive semantical nature of transcategorical terms,\nwhich they refer to, among others, as \u2018transcendent names\u2019\n(nomina transcendentia). Three instances: (i.)\nWhereas a Vienna Priscian-commentary partially edited by De Rijk (dated\nca. 1150) identifies a certain class of names \u201cthat are so\nuniversal that they run through all categories\u201d, such as\n\u2018being\u2019, \u2018thing\u2019, \u2018one\u2019,\n\u2018something\u2019, the Ars Meliduna (between\n1154/1180) distinguishes transgeneric terms from universals proper.\n\u201cNo name that belongs to every thing, such as\n\u2018thing\u2019, \u2018something\u2019, \u2018being\u2019, and\n\u2018one\u2019, signifies a universal\u201d. Since universals are\nbound up to genera, transgeneric terms do not signify a universal. The\ncategories, as the highest genera, determine what a thing is,\nthe transgeneric names signify that it is. (ii.) In the debate\non \u201cinfinite names\u201d (nomina infinita),\nwhich refers to the possibility of \u2018making a term infinite\u2019\n(infinitatio) by term-negation, a distinction is made in the\nIntroductiones Montane minores (ca. 1130) and the \nTractatus Anagnini (ca. 1200), between finite terms\nand terms that \u201ccontain all things\u201d, e.g.\n\u2018thing\u2019 and \u2018something\u2019. Since these terms are\nnot finite, they cannot be made infinite: \u201cTerms that contain all\nthings cannot be made infinite, hence this is senseless: \u2018a\nnon-something is\u2019, \u2018a non-thing is\u2019.\u201d (iii.) In\nthe discussion on the equivocity of names in the Dialectica\nMonacensis (between 1150\u20131200), a specific type of\nequivocation is identified, in which something is signified primarily,\neverything else secondarily, and this type of equivocation is connected\nwith the nomina transcendentia, i.e. names like\n\u2018thing\u2019, \u2018being\u2019, \u2018one\u2019,\n\u2018universal\u2019, \u2018possible\u2019,\n\u2018contingent\u2019, \u2018the same\u2019 and\n\u2018diverse\u2019 as such. (See Jacobi 2003.)\n\n\nThe logical \u2018surpassing\u2019 expressed by the\nnomina transcendentia is the order of the predicables\nor universals described by Porphyry. If the relation between subject\nand predicate, Porphyry claims, is such that the predicate belongs to\nthe essence of the subject, then it is either a genus, or species, or\ndifference; if the predicate does not belong to the essence of the\nsubject, it is either convertible with it, and then it is a property\n(proprium), or if not convertible, then it is an accident. Now\nthe most universal are Aristotle\u2019s ten categories, which Porphyry\ndefines as \u201cthat above which there will be no other superordinate\ngenus.\u201d (Porph., Introduction 2.5) In answer to the\nquestion whether \u2018being\u2019, since it is said of everything,\nis not a genus common to the highest genera, Porphyry states that the\nten categories are primarily diverse, and hence concludes to the\nequivocity of \u2018being\u2019.\n\n\nThe formation of the doctrine of the transcendentals in the 13th\ncentury introduces a class of predicates that are not discussed by\nPorphyry. In reaction to this absence, one can either define the\ntranscendentals in contradistinction to universals, as witnessed in the\nArs Meliduna, or extend the list of universals by\nincluding a sixth universal predicable. An instance of the first\nreaction we find in William of Ockham\u2019s Commentary on\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge, who explicitly addresses the question\nwhether the classification of the predicables with regard to the\nconcept of being is exhaustive (i.e. the question of the\n\u201csufficiency\u201d of Porphyry\u2019s division of the\npredicables), and distinguishes between terms that are predicates of\nmany, the universals, and terms predicated of all, the common terms.\n(Ockham, Expositio in librum Porphyrii de\nPraedicabilibus, prooem. 2) An instance of the second reaction we\nfind in Duns Scotus; as a consequence of his defense of the univocity\nof being, Scotus is prepared in his Commentary on the\nMetaphysics to extend the list of predicables with a sixth one, a\n\u2018transcendental universal\u2019 (universale\ntranscendens), as examples of which he names\n\u2018being\u2019 and \u2018one\u2019. (Duns Scotus,\nQuaestiones super libros Metaphysicorum, IV, q.\n1)\n\n\nPorphyry\u2019s list of predicables not only occasioned the\nquestion of its relation to transcendental predicates, but also\nsupplied a model to express the relation of \u2018being\u2019 to the\nother transcendentals as the relation between a subject and its\nproperties (propria). Although the transcendentals are\nco-extensive, they differ conceptually. The privileged model to express\nthis relationship was the predication of a property (proprium)\nof a subject, which is defined by Porphyry with two characteristics: on\nthe one hand, properties are convertible with the subject, on the other\nhand, they are outside the essence of the subject. The first\ncharacteristic was of great convenience, since it offers the\npossibility to combine the convertibility of the transcendentals with\nthe basic task of science: to demonstrate the existence of properties\nthat belong per se to its subject and are hence convertible with it. By\nexplaining the relation between \u2018being\u2019 and the other\ntranscendental predicates as the relation between a subject and its\nproperties, the doctrine of the transcendentals gives flesh to the\nscience of \u2018being\u2019 called metaphysics, the core of which is\nthe demonstration that \u2018being\u2019 has convertible properties,\nlike \u2018one\u2019, \u2018true\u2019, and \u2018good\u2019. The\nsecond characteristic of a property was more problematic at the\ntranscendental level, for it implies the recognition that the\ntranscendentals, as really distinct from being, are nothing. Most\ntheoreticians of the transcendentals, therefore, denied the application\nof this second characteristic to the transcendental level and held that\na transcendental property differs from being only conceptually\n(secundum rationem). Duns Scotus and the tradition he\nestablished, however, accepted a real distinction in the sense of a\nformal distinction (for this term, cf. infra) in the relation between\n\u2018being\u2019 and its transcendental properties.\n",
