Philosophy of Mind\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a is eager to point out that he is not\nskeptical of all commonsense ontological categories (KKh 62\u201363).\nConsciousness, for him, is ultimately real; only the world,\ninsofar as it appears distinct from consciousness, isn\u2019t. What\nreason do we have for treating consciousness as ultimately real?\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a answers this question by defending a positive\nproposal about self-knowledge and intentionality. This section\ndiscusses that proposal. \n",
