    "main_text": "The Controversy between Wolff and the Pietists || The \u201cLeibnizian-Wolffian\u201d Philosophy\n3.1 The \u201cLeibnizian-Wolffian\u201d Philosophy\n\nChristian Wolff was born in Breslau (today, Wroc\u0142aw) on 24\nJanuary 1679. By all accounts a gifted student, he developed an\ninterest in theology and mathematics during his time in Gymnasium, and\nstudied theology and mathematics at the University of Jena and then in\nLeipzig, gaining his Magister at Leizpig in 1702. His\nsubsequent Habilitationsschrift on introducing mathematical\nmethod to practical philosophy drew Leibniz\u2019s attention to him.\nThey began a correspondence that continued until Leibniz\u2019s death\nin 1716, and which covered topics from mathematics to metaphysics.\nPartially through Leibniz\u2019s support, Wolff was appointed to a\nvacant chair in mathematics at the Friedrichs-Universit\u00e4t in\nHalle, delivering his inaugural lecture in 1707.\n\nUnderstandably, given the nature of his position, most of\nWolff\u2019s initial publications were devoted to mathematics and\nnatural science, including an introduction to mathematics in 1710 and\nan influential mathematical dictionary in 1716. Around 1710, however,\nhe began to lecture on more narrowly philosophical topics, publishing\nhis Vern\u00fcnfftige Gedancken von den Kr\u00e4fften des\nmenschlichen Verstandes und ihrem richtigen Gebrauche in\nErk\u00e4ntnis der Wahrheit (Rational Thoughts on the Powers\nof the Human Understanding and its Propert Use in the Cognition of\nTruth) [the \u201cGerman Logic\u201d, hereafter GL] in\n1713. Thus began Wolff\u2019s famous series of German-language\ntextbooks on philosophical topics, which would grow to include the\nVern\u00fcnftige Gedanken von Gott, der Welt und der Seele des\nMenschen, auch allen Dingen \u00fcberhaupt (Rational Thoughts\non God, the World and the Soul of Man, and on All Things in\nGeneral) [the \u201cGerman Metaphysics\u201d,\nhereafter GM] in 1719 (albeit with a publication date of 1720), and\nthe Vern\u00fcnfftige Gedancken von der Menschen Thun und Lassen,\nzu Bef\u00f6rderung ihrer Gl\u00fcckseligkeit (Rational\nThoughts on Human Actions for the Promotion of their Happiness)\n[the \u201cGerman Ethics\u201d, hereafter GE] in 1720,\nfollowed by the \u201cGerman Politics\u201d in 1721, the\n\u201cGerman Physics\u201d in 1723, and the\n\u201cGerman Teleology\u201d in 1724.\n\nThis series of texts constitutes the first presentation of the\nso-called \u201cLeibnizian-Wolffian\u201d philosophy that would come\nto dominate the philosophical landscape in Germany. There is, of\ncourse, no question that Wolff\u2019s philosophical system is\nthoroughly informed by Leibniz\u2019s: Wolff himself admits that the\nreading of Leibniz\u2019s 1684 essay \u201cMeditations on Cognition,\nTruth, and Ideas\u201d, and Leibniz\u2019s classification of ideas\nin particular, had sparked a \u201cgreat light\u201d that informed\nhis German Logic (cf. GL \u201cVorrede\u201d); moreover,\nWolff himself reports that he incorporated a number of Leibnizian\nconcepts into his presentation of ontology, cosmology, and rational\npsychology in the German Metaphysics (cf. Wuttke 1841:\n141\u2013142). Even so, Wolff points out that when he started writing\nhis series of philosophical textbooks there were few of\nLeibniz\u2019s texts available through which one might get a sense of\nthe wider Leibnizian philosophy (Wuttke 1841: 140\u2013141; cf. also\nWilson 1994); thus he takes issue with the designation of his system\nas \u201cLeibnizian-Wolffian\u201d\u2014a coinage he credits to one\nof his students, Georg Bernhard Bilfinger (Wuttke 1841: 142). The\nextent of Leibniz\u2019s influence on Wolff is widely debated (cf.\nCorr 1975; \u00c9cole 1979), but it is in any case clear that\nLeibniz is not the sole, nor in every case the most important,\ninfluence on the development of Wolff\u2019s ideas, as figures such\nas Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (1651\u20131708), John Locke,\nand late Scholastic thinkers also exerted an important influence on\nhis metaphysics, epistemology, and theory of science (Neveu 2018;\nLeduc 2018; Dyck 2021a).\n\nTurning to a brief overview of Wolff\u2019s philosophical works, the\nGerman Logic is intended, quite in contrast to\nThomasius\u2019, as a handbook for the acquisition, justification,\nand orderly presentation of scientific cognition. So, in addition to\nthe now expected treatment of concepts, propositions, and syllogisms,\nWolff\u2019s text contains discussion of drawing universal\npropositions from individual experiences, of experiments, and of\nscience and its distinction from faith and opinion. Moreover, the\nGerman Logic contains Wolff\u2019s mature presentation of\nhis mathematical method, through which we proceed from definitions and\naxioms to the formulation of theorems and postulates, and ultimately\nto demonstrations, and it outlines how the method can be employed for\nthe purpose of scientific discovery (for discussion, see Frketich\n2019; Gava 2019). Significantly, it is this method that gains\nwidespread application throughout Wolff\u2019s philosophical\nenterprise, including in his metaphysics.\n\nThe German Metaphysics was Wolff\u2019s next major\nphilosophical text, and in it he formally introduces the division of\nmetaphysical topics into ontology, cosmology, empirical and rational\npsychology and natural theology, a division that Kant, among others,\nwould subsequently take up. The initial chapter attempts to make\nevident, in a Cartesian vein, both an indubitable truth (\u201cwe are\ncertain that we exist\u201d) and to establish a canon for what will\ncount as a certain cognition for the remainder of the\nenterprise. In the second chapter Wolff sets out the two (Leibnizian)\nprinciples governing his philosophical thought: the principle of\ncontradiction (\u201csomething cannot both be and not be at the same\ntime\u201d GM \u00a710) and the principle of sufficient reason.\nSignificantly, Wolff suggests that while the first is self-evident,\nthe second admits of proof, for which Wolff (in a departure from\nLeibniz) offers two arguments. The first proceeds as follows:\n\n\nWere it the case that something could be, or take place, in a thing\nwithout a reason why it should occur being met with either in that\nthing itself or something else, then it would come to be from nothing.\nSince, however, it is impossible that something could come to be from\nnothing, everything that is must have a sufficient reason why it\nis. (GM \u00a730 [2019: 101])\n\n\nIn the remainder of the ontology, Wolff provides accounts of concepts\nthat will be key for his subsequent treatment of specific metaphysical\ntopics, including essence and attribute, space and time, simple and\ncomposite, substance, power, and cause.\n\nThe chapters on empirical and rational psychology outline an account\nof the soul in general and of the human soul in particular. In his\nempirical treatment, Wolff considers what can be known of the soul by\nmeans of our ordinary inner experience. He contends that we can\ndistinguish thoughts in terms of obscurity, clarity, and distinctness,\nbut we can also distinguish the soul\u2019s representations in terms\nof their content. Accordingly, they can be classified into sensations,\nimaginings, and thoughts proper, which can in turn be traced back to\nvarious faculties of the soul, including sensibility, imagination, and\nthe understanding, in virtue of which it is capable of these distinct\nthoughts. We also discern that the soul is subject to pleasure and\ndispleasure in its (distinct or indistinct) cognition of good and\nevil, which give rise to desires and willing (based on indistinct and\ndistinct cognition respectively), and when that willing is in\naccordance with what pleases the soul the most then, for Wolff, its\nacts are free (GM \u00a7519).\n\nOn the basis of these empirical cognitions of the soul, rational\npsychology seeks to draw inferences regarding the soul\u2019s essence\nand nature. Wolff argues that the soul must be immaterial given that\nit is impossible that a body should think (GM \u00a7738), and as a\nresult that the soul is a simple substance endowed with a power of\nwhich its thoughts are effects, which power is identified as a power\nof representation (GM \u00a7\u00a7742\u20137). This secures the\nsoul\u2019s natural immortality, or incorruptibility, but Wolff\nargues for the soul\u2019s personal immortality, or its preservation\nof its state of conscious representation and memory in the afterlife\n(GM \u00a7\u00a7925\u20136). It is in the context of rational\npsychology that Wolff also offers a defence of the Leibnizian doctrine\nof pre-established harmony (\u00a7765), which he think accounts for\nthe empirically-observed agreement between the states of the soul and\nthe body better than the competing systems of physical influence and\noccasional causation.\n\nThe final pair of topics concern the world (cosmology) and God\n(natural theology). Regarding the former, Wolff identifies the world\nas the \u201cseries of changeable things that are next to one another\nand follow one upon the other\u201d (GM \u00a7544 [2019: 120]). As\nsuch, the world is a composite consisting of ultimately simple\nsubstances, though Wolff declines to identify them as Leibnizian\nmonads as he hesitates to ascribe representational states to the\nconstituents (\u201celements\u201d) of matter (GM\n\u00a7\u00a7598\u20139). Things and events in the world are\nnonetheless connected to one another in accordance with the principle\nof sufficient reason, and Wolff concludes that all events are certain\nas a result (GM \u00a7561). Concerning God, Wolff argues that He must\nexist inasmuch as our own evident existence requires a necessary being\nto serve as its sufficient reason, which necessary being must also be\nindependent, eternal, and simple (GM \u00a7\u00a7928\u2013936); it\ncannot, therefore, be the world (a composite) nor our own soul (a\nbeing dependant on the world), and so can only be God (GM \u00a7945).\nIn addition to these attributes, God must have an understanding,\nthrough which He distinctly represents all that is possible, and a\nfree will inasmuch as He chooses that world which pleases Him most to\nmake actual (GM \u00a7980).\n\nRounding out Wolff\u2019s major philosophical works of this period,\nthe German Ethics is composed of four parts, a theoretical\npart that treats the foundation of practical philosophy and three\npractical parts that present a doctrine of duties that human beings\nhave towards themselves, God, and others. The central notion in\nWolff\u2019s ethics is the (metaphysical) notion of perfection which\nconcerns the \u201cagreement\u201d of elements in a given manifold\n(cf. GM \u00a7152), and which is cognized through our intellectual\npowers. It is the cognition of the (apparent) perfection in an action\nthat moves us to act, a fact that accounts for Wolff\u2019s emphasis\non the duty to cultivate our understanding among our duties to\nourselves so that we can be moved to act in (what are in fact) the\nmost perfect ways. Promoting the perfection of ourselves and others\nserves for Wolff as the universal rule in accordance with which we\nought to choose between two (or more) possible actions (GE \u00a712).\nThat is to say, when making a free choice we ought to consider whether\nthe action \u201cpromotes the perfection of our inner and outer\nstate\u201d (GE \u00a72) and that means considering whether the state\nof the soul and the body accords with the prior state or contradicts\nit. The outcome has greater perfection to the extent that it\ncontributes to the continued \u201cnatural human state and its\nharmonious preservation over time\u201d(GE \u00a72). The natural\nhuman state Wolff envisions is the state of the soul in its manifold\nefforts to find truth, and everything has to be done to maximize that\nstate. It so happens, that this is where happiness lies as well, and\nas Wolff indicates at the end of the ethics, it is incumbent upon\nhuman beings to ensure not only their own perfection/happiness, but to\n\u201ccontribute as much as possible to the happiness of\nothers\u201d (GE \u00a7767).\n",
