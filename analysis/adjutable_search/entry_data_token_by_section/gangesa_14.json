    "main_text": "Analogy\n6. Analogy\n\nDifferent schools of classical philosophy have very different\nunderstandings of \u201canalogy,\u201d upam\u0101na, and,\nunlike with perception, inference, and testimony, cross-school\ncontroversies seem often at cross-purposes. For example,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, worried about the criteria for substitutes\nfor materials enjoined to carry out rituals, talk about similarities\nas objective, whereas Naiy\u0101yikas are concerned principally with\nword meanings, although V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (1997: 170\u20131) does\nshow the usefulness of analogy to indicate something new, a medicinal\nplant, for instance, similar to one with which an interlocutor is\nfamiliar. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba sees the working of analogy to result\nsolely in learning the meaning of words. Nevertheless, appreciation of\nsimilarity, which he sees as a supervenient property, is, he says,\ncrucial in the operation of the knowledge source. The\nJewel\u2019s chapter on analogy is quite short and lacks\nsubsections, hardly a \u201cchapter\u201d in comparison with the\nother three.\n\nWhat comes to be a stock example of analogical knowledge according to\nNy\u0101ya is elaborated in Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra\ncommentaries and textbooks preceding Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, who fills in\ndetails. A subject \\(S\\) inquires of a forester about a\ngavaya, which is a kind of buffalo, having heard the word\n\u2018gavaya\u2019 used among her schoolmates but not\nknowing what it means, i.e., not knowing to what\n\u2018gavaya\u2019 refers. Questioned by \\(S\\), the\nforester replies that a gavaya is like a cow, mentioning\ncertain specifics as also some dissimilarities. To simplify,\nNy\u0101ya philosophers say that the forester makes an analogical\nstatement (\u201cA gavaya is like a cow\u201d), whereby,\naccording to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, our subject \\(S\\) now knows in\ngeneral what the word means. But \\(S\\) does not yet know its\nreference, which he deems its principal meaning. Later encountering a\ngavaya buffalo, \\(S\\) says, \u201cThis, which is similar to\na cow, is the meaning of the word\n\u2018gavaya\u2019,\u201d a statement which expresses\n\\(S\\)\u2019s new knowledge. Every instance of knowledge has a source,\nand this one has been generated by upam\u0101na,\n\u201canalogy.\u201d Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba writes (2020: 1207):\n\n\nObjection:\n\nThe question [of the subject to the forester] concerns only the cause\nof her (eventual) knowledge (qua qualificandum). The answer gives its\nqualifiers.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba: No. Since she does not know the particulars\n(that would ground use of the word), she would be answered by the\nforester also with reference to a need for a sensory\nencounter: \u201cIf you go into the forest, you will see.\u201d\n\nTherefore, \\(S\\)\u2019s questions would concern only the distinct\ngrounds of employment: \u201cWhat is a gavaya like? On what\ngrounds does one employ the word \u2018gavaya\u2019?\u201d\nSince the one asked (viz., the forester) would not be able to show\nimmediately, directly (s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t), what it is to\nbe a gavaya buffalo, he would talk about similarity,\nindirectly indicating it (i.e., indicating what it is to be a\ngavaya buffalo). And then later, when an individual has been\nseen by \\(S\\) who remembers the meaning of the analogical statement,\nshe acquires the knowledge: \u201cThis thing qualified by what it is\nto be a gavaya is the referent of the word\n\u2018gavaya\u2019.\u201d \\(S\\)\u2019s knowledge is of a\nparticular that is the grounds for the employment of the word. It is\nthe result of analogy (as a knowledge source).\n\n",
