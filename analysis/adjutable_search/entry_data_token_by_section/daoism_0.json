    "main_text": "Philosophical Daoism: A Primer\n2. Philosophical Daoism: A Primer\n\nAncient Chinese thinkers discussed mainly three parts of dao:\nhuman (or social) dao, tiannatural\ndao, and great dao.\nWhen I instruct you to put your hand on your partner\u2019s head, I am\ndelivering some human dao. Human dao is typically\nenshrined in a language\u2014which may include the language of\nplanning. Human daos are normative space-time\nstructures\u2014recommended possible histories. Natural\ndao (often translated heavenly dao) is akin to what\nwe would consider the constancies of science. It is the ways things\nreliably (constantly) have happened and will happen. Great\ndao refers to the entire actual history of\neverything\u2014whatever has happened, is happening or actually will\nhappen in the universe constitutes the great dao. \n\nDaoists, however, do not formulate these categories\nexplicitly\u2014partly because they may seem to overlap. A\nform of determinism, for example, would treat tian dao and\ngreat dao as identical\u2014the laws of nature make\nonly one world-history possible. Common sense\nindeterminism would regard many possible world histories as\nconsistent with tian dao. In general, however, it is best to\nthink of Great dao as simply the counterpart of\nWittgenstein\u2019s \u201cAll that is the case\u201d\u2014the extended\nactual space-time world. One of the insights of the Zhuangzi,\nnot as clearly reflected in the Laozi, is that human\ndao is embedded in, part of and consistent with, both great\ndao and natural dao (tian dao). \n\nDaoist philosophers typically express their doubts about first-order\nhuman dao (paradigmatically Confucian and Mohist\ndao) by considering them in relation to natural dao\nand/or great dao (the actual dao).\nThis plays on the tendency of rival schools of ancient Chinese\nmoralists to treat tiannature:sky\nas the authority for their favored\nhuman daos. Mature Daoist analysis centers on the insight\nthat while human daos are normative, neither the natural nor\nthe actual dao are. Natural dao and Great\ndao are\n \u201cconstant\u201d\n while human dao are inherently changeable and subject to\ninterpretation. This insight is most famously expressed in the first\nline of the Daode Jing \u201cdaoguides\nthat can daoguide\nare not constant daoguides.\u201d\n\nGiven the shared ru-moConfucian-Mohist\nassumption that normative\nauthority for their competing first-order daos comes from\nsome form of endorsement by tiannature:sky,\nDaoists aver that nature does not\nauthorize or endorse any particular social dao. This\nclaim has two versions: pluralist and primitivist. Denying that it\nendorses a particular one is compatible with its\nallowing either many or none. The\nnihilistic answer might take the form of an assertion that reality is\nan amorphous chaos and all daos impose an illusory or unreal\nsocial structure on Chaos. This version, however, has no obvious\nnormative implications. \n\nTo answer \u201cnone\u201d and still treat tiannature:sky\nas the normative authority generates\na dichotomy between human and natural dao. The metaphysical\ntype of human social dao is guiding discourse, so this line\nof thought motivates Daoist \u201csilence\u201d\u2014the notorious\nreluctance to use language. The philosophical quietism is also\nmotivational and intentional quietism\u2014essentially an extreme\nform of stoicism. This treats accepting natural dao as not\nusing guidance or identifying the \u201chighest\u201d guidance with\n\u201cwhatever happens\u201d the quintessential position of Shen\nDao. Technically, however, Shen Dao does not formulate a doctrine of\ndeterminism (the identity of naturally possible dao and the actual\n\u201cGreat\u201d dao. The appearance of fatalism comes\nfrom concluding that we have no moral responsibility\u2014to\nenact the Great dao in our actions.\n\nThe Zhuangzi strain, informed by contact with Chinese philosophy of\nlanguage, recognized that a blanket anti-language position was\nself-censuring. The instruction not to follow any dao is\nitself a dao and thus enjoins against following\nitself\u2014a prescriptive paradox. The pluralist reading is that all\nde facto rival practices are natural daos in virtue\nof their being actual practices. Human daos\nin general are a part of natural dao. That they \u201care\nwalked\u201d shows they are, in that sense, compatible with natural\nconstancies. Similarly, all actual rival daos are\npart of great dao simply in virtue of being followed\u2014as\nthe Zhuangzi says, \u201cdaos are made by walking\nthem\u201d. \n\nBoth pluralist and primitivist Daoism would reject the\nConfucian-Mohist conclusion that political authority should be used to\nbring about a harmony of daos\u2014making everyone follow a\nsingle dao. The social world survives as well (or better)\nwhen people follow different ways of life. Focus on either\ntiannature:sky dao\nor Great dao helps to undermine the sense that it is\nimperative to master or impose any\nparticular first-order dao.\nTiannature dao,\nlike great dao justifies no particular judgment whatever.\n\nThe primitivist version of Daoism, however, can religiously take a\nmore assertive form that nature does endorse a\nparticular normative dao, albeit not a\nhuman one (particularly one in discourse form). There\nis a single, constant, correct way of life that cannot be expressed or\npresented in practices, rules, narratives, maps, examples, songs or\nany other human or social form of communication and advocacy.\nIt implicitly must be a super-human dao accessed via\nsuper-human epistemic capacities\u2014mystical or esoteric\ndao. Though it is usually expressed as the\nnatural dao, there is no obvious reason why there might not\nbe multiple super-human daos. \n\nA different version of the primitivist interpretive line is that there\nare fully natural ways but that they require finer or more complex\ndiscriminations than normal humans are capable of. Humans could follow\nthem, as it were, by luck or accident, but not reliably via any\nlearnable pattern. If one subtracts the claims to superhuman epistemic\ncapacities, then an interpretive hypothesis would yield a combination\nof both natural realism and skepticism. Still another possibility\nwould be of naturalistic ways to do something that\nare humanly accessible\u2014but in different ways to\neach different human or in each situation. There would be no learnable\nsocial formula that could be of any use and no one\u2019s having\nsuccessfully done it could count as \u201cknowing\u201d\nit in the sense of being reliably able to do it again or in\nthe sense of being able to teach others. In that case, the\ninterpretation would be both realistic and relativist and\nmildly skeptical\u2014most of us don\u2019t actually know and, though in\nprinciple we could do it on occasions, no one could know a reliable\nshareable process or content for acquiring that dao.\n\nA contrarian version expresses itself via deliberate flaunting or\n\u201creversing\u201d all the norms and attitudes in the\nconventional dao. Laozi\u2019s is the most famous example of this\ndao of reversal, though overtones can be found in Zhuangzi\u2019s\ndescription of \u201cthe perfect\u201d person or ability as one that\nis so incomprehensible and so irrelevant to our concerns that he\nappears as the opposite whatever we normally respect. The political\nconsequence is still a government guided by a discourse\ndao\u2014the systematic reversal of the dominant Confucian\ndao.\n\nRelativist (pluralist) or skeptical versions need not deny that there\nare norms for endorsing some daos over others, but would\nacknowledge that the norms of endorsing a dao constitute a\ndistinct dao that we presuppose in choosing it. This\nmeta-dao, by hypothesis, is also natural in being \u201cactual\u201d\nso the relativism involved need not be irrealism. Such relativism\ndeserves the \u2018Daoist\u2019 appellation on the further ground\nthat it entails that normative authority comes from higher-level\ndao, not from the Confucian-Mohist\n tiannature:sky.\nHowever, actual nature gives us\nmany candidate daos. It\u2019s conclusion, thus, is not\nthat we should flaunt or violate nature, but that we simply cannot\nflaunt it. Any of the options actually available to us for guidance\nare components of both the natural and Great daos. Hence,\n\u201cfollow the natural dao\u201d is empty (tautological)\nas a normative guide\u2014a dao that does not dao.\nWhatever dao we choose will be a natural one, in virtue of\nbeing one we in fact can choose and \u201cwalk\u201d. \n\nThe naturalist, mystical, and intuitionist versions similarly draw\ndifferently nuanced conclusions from this analysis of the role of\ndaos in nature and actual history. Intuitionism teeters\ntoward the religious strain\u2019s claim of special epistemic access, but\ncould be developed in an egalitarian and even a naturalistic way.\nNaturalism is inherently more egalitarian but tends, uncritically, to\nconfuse being neutral with rejecting actually existing social\ndao. Mysticism\u2019s implications are, by definition, unclear.\nDaoist mysticism tends toward what some call \u201cexternal\nmysticism.\u201d It arises from reflections on the context\nsensitivity and normative complexity of dao rather than from\nsome \u201cinner\u201d experience as of an inexpressible\n\u201coneness.\u201d If combined with some doctrine or a particular\n(discourse or non-discourse) dao, it tends to foster\nreligious claims of superlative \u201caccess\u201d to a mystically\n\u201ccorrect\u201d penetration of the complexity\u2014though it\nmay still claim that the insight is equally accessible to everyone.\nThis access need not be mystical if it consists simply in giving up\nany attempt to determine how to guide one\u2019s behavior but even that\ncounts as a dao\u2014but probably contains a prescriptive\nparadox. \n\nDespite the divergence in these versions of Daoism, all can claim to\nunderwrite a theme of harmony with nature\u2014the pluralist sees the\npoint of such harmony as permissive and tolerant, while the\nprimitivist sees it as a more intolerant rejection or\nprohibition of any conventional dao.\n\nMetaphysically, Daoism is naturalistic in that any first-order moral\ndao must be rooted in natural ways. It doesn\u2019t\ncharacterize the natural dao as either physical or mental.\nLike the varieties of metaphysical naturalism that eschew both a\ncommitment to realism or anti-realism, it simply accepts natural\ndao without a separate theory of whether it is real or not.\n\n3. The Origins of Daoism\n\n3.1 Attitudinal Daoism I: Anarchism\n3.2 Attitudinal Daoism II: Authoritarian Intuitionism\n3.3 Pre-Laozi Daoist Theory\n\n\nMuch of the thrust of Daoism, as we have seen, naturally motivates a\nreaction against the moralistic and elitist inclinations of\nConfucianism. Confucianism stood for a rigid, detailed, traditional\npattern of hierarchical social behavior. Duties were assigned to all\nof one\u2019s social roles\u2014and a person typically had many such\nroles, e.g., husband, father, minister, younger brother, teacher,\nstudent, etc. One could escape this heavy scheme of obligations mainly\nin retirement or, paradoxically, the traditional duty to spend three\nyears \u201cin mourning\u201d for the death of one\u2019s father. The\nwithdrawal from society, the antipathy toward ritual roles,\ntraditional \u201cmorality,\u201d and any social structures or\ntraditional culture suggests a kind of Daoist \u201cethos\u201d as\nan antithesis to Confucianism in China. We can trace the origin of\nDaoism, accordingly, in two ways. One is attitudinal, the other\ntheoretical. The theoretical mark of Daoism is an interest in the\nmeaning or nature of dao which may inform or encourage Daoist\nattitudes. In view of the religious strain, however, we have to\nrecognize two attitudes as marks of proto-Daoism in China. The first\nis the vague reaction against the demanding scheme of traditional\nConfucian rules. The second is interest in techniques for cultivating\nthe adept to achieve an elevated epistemic status resulting in with\nsome special or transcendent access to a dao that is\nimpenetrable to those who have not had this\n\u201ccultivation.\u201d\n3.1 Attitudinal Daoism I: Anarchism\n\nTraditionally scholars have traced the first \u201cDaoist\nspirit\u201d back to \u201cproto-Daoist\u201d hermits who crop up\nsporadically in the Analects, confronting Confucius and his\ndisciples as they traveled to or fled from various rulers. Their\napproximate message was an early version of Yangist purification by\nwithdrawal from society. Robert\n Eno[3]\n argues that Confucius himself had a heavy dose of this\n\u201cDaoist\u201d attitude and his \u201cpolitical\u201d theory\nwas actually a justification of his staying remote from\ngovernment\u2014at least until a sage is in power! This attitude\ntends to be expressed as anti-moral or amoral mainly because it\ntargets a Confucian conception that systematically elides morality and\nconventional mores. It also seems to include some of the attitudes\nthat led to the agriculturalists with their opposition to the division\nof labor, the differential social status and ranks to which it gives\nrise. These, however, seem to involve no meta-theory of dao\nof the type traced in the Zhuangzi history although they can\nbe seen as early indications of the value of Daoist egalitarianism and\nimpartiality.\n\nAnother candidate for this \u201cproto-Daoist\u201d status, Yang\nZhu, we know mainly from Mencian attacks. According to Mencius, Yang\nZhu derived opposition to society and politics from an ethical egoism\n(emphasizing \u201cme\u201d). Angus Graham has influentially (and\ncontroversially) reconstructed Yang Zhu\u2019s ideas, but they too do not\ninclude explicit meta-theorizing about the nature of dao.\nYangism mainly proposes a (shocking!) rival first order normative\ndao\u2014egoism. Yangist echoes surface prominently in the\nLaozi and in huge chunks of the \u201couter chapters\u201d\nof the Zhuangzi. At its core is an arguably Daoist worry that\nsocial conventions and structures damage our natural spontaneity and\ninterfere with efficient functioning of our natural powers. Early\nChinese moral theory flowed too easily between mores and\nmorality and we may see the lure of Daoist impartiality in\nthe Yangist desire to dispense with relative social mores.\n3.2 Attitudinal Daoism II: Authoritative Intuition\n\nOthers credited as precursors of Daoism seemed to reflect a version of\nthe moralists\u2019 confidence that they had achieved some non-linguistic\nor\n intuitive\n access to a daoguide that\nresists \u201cordinary\u201d formulation. It amounts to direct\naccess to what, for ordinary people, is the product of\ninterpreting a first order dao. Thus it lacks the inherent\nvagueness of a formulaic dao. The Confucian value of\nrenhumanity is the\nmoralists\u2019 most prominent manifestation of this tendency. Such\nintuitionism, while cursorily evading interpretive variability, led\ninstead to insoluble conflicts of authority. They disagreed with each\nother about who else had such access and any attempt to resolve that\ntransmuted into an attempt to formulate or theorize about the\nintuition, thus threatening to abandon their hard won interpretive\nconstancy. This is because the common formulation of these disputes\nconstitutes a theory or dao of how to cultivate the unerring\ninterpretive access to other dao. \n\nHal Roth emphasizes this line of thought and follows Graham in linking\nit to two recently prominent chapters of an early Legalist\ntext, the Guanzi (neiyeinward\ntraining and xin shuheart-mind\nmethods). The writers claim to have\nachieved this direct access to dao and Roth links the\n\u201cachievement\u201d to evidence of early Chinese interests in\nmeditative practices including breath control, fasting (and\nnotoriously wine and possibly other hallucinogens). Victor Mair,\nsuggests that Yogic techniques, already transmitted from India, played\nthis role. The epistemic commitment both hypotheses impute to their\nproto-Daoists, however, is that these techniques help achieve\nincorruptible practical access to the correct normative\ndaoguide. Usually this\naccess was direct and unmediated by language or culture. So they might\necho the anarchists rejection of rules or principles but for quite\ndifferent reasons, i.e., that they can neither formulate nor\ninferentially defend their intuitively \u201ccorrect\u201d\ndao. \n\nThe inferred interpretive reliability in this stream of Daoism\nreflects a kind of impartiality, the irresolvability of rival claims\nto infallible practical guidance threatens that goal. It can be\ndeveloped in an egalitarian way (i.e., everyone has such immediate,\nunerring guidance) that also removes any conflict by inviting a\nradically subjective relativism or romantic, primitivist\n optimism.[4]\n But it is more routinely developed into esoteric and authoritative\ndirections, requiring adepts to subject themselves to the some version\nof the dogmatic cultivation techniques. Both may, however, share\nDaoism\u2019s implicit enmity toward the first-order moralists and Daoism\nmay draw from its suspicion of traditional texts and normative\nprecepts.\n\nThere can be little doubt that this dogmatic, self-congratulatory\ntrend of \u201cauthoritarian intuitionism\u201d existed in classical\nthinking. One can, however, doubt that it is either a necessary or\nsufficient distinguisher of Daoism. It finds a more comfortable home\nin proto-Legalist texts and arguably blends the ingredients of\nHuang-Lao ruler-worship. It is also quite obviously manifest in\nauthoritarian and intuitionistic Confucianism with its emphasis on\ncultivation. Confucian interpretations, like religious ones, typically\ntreat Daoists as making Confucian-style, elitist cultivation claims.\n\n\nPhilosophical interpretations are naturally less comfortable taking\nthese authoritarians as forerunners of Daoism and usually require some\nversion of them that pushes them toward relativism or optimistic\nprimitivism. The esoteric or authoritarian developments seem too\ncavalierly to brush-off the skeptical doubts that generated\nphilosophical reflection on dao and the impulse to seek an\nimpartial resolution. A characteristically religious excuse for\ncoercive indoctrination is available. After \u201cproper\ncultivation,\u201d the rebellious person would \u201csee\u201d and\nappreciate their wisdom in thus coercing him. Thus the Huang-Lao\ntradition could mesh with the authoritarian Confucian and Legalist\nelites who dominated the Han. With the Mawang Dui discovery (see\n Texts and Textual Theory)\n came more evidence of Huang-Lao theory. Just how far back its history\nextends into the classical period remains controversial. It was highly\ninfluential in the Qin and Han, when it seemed to be highly favored by\nthe superstitious rulers. Han historians categorized many of the\nfigures in the Daoist history as students of Huang-Lao. \n\nMany scholars have treated the Mawang Dui discovery as proving the\nLaozi stems from such authoritarian forerunners of this cult.\nThe arguments are inconclusive, necessarily so since the\nLaozi\u2019s emergence remains so obscure. In the definitional\ntexts, the Laozi and the Zhuangzi, the epistemic\ngrounds are arguably more skeptical and perspectival than dogmatic.\nThere is little unambiguous appeal to direct mystical experience or\ninsight. In these texts, hypothetical exemplars of such authoritative,\nsuperlative knowledge of dao are typically described as being both\nincomprehensible and irrelevant to us and our practical questions. In\nany case, the ambiguous style of both texts comports poorly with the\nimplicit authoritarianism of the religious movement and it is very\nhard to show how philosophically the use of breathing techniques,\nmeditation, proto-yogic practices or hallucinogens could vouchsafe\nsuch supernatural epistemic achievements. They do nothing to explain\nor justify the sophisticated philosophical understanding of\ndao we can find in these texts. \n\nUltimately, the philosophical question is whether these assertions of\nintuitionist access would or would not be refuted by the skeptical\narguments that Zhuangzi directed against the Confucians. Given their\nsimilarities, it\u2019s difficult to imagine how these religious\nconclusions could escape his analysis. Modern champions of\nirrationalist Daoism, of course, would not be disturbed by this\ninconsistency, of course, since, they allege, that Daoists refuse to\nthink logically. Finally, like the attitudinal Daoist stream, the\nauthoritarian intuition approach deals with the epistemology of access\nto dao rather than to an analysis of its nature and how\ninsight into that nature can illuminate and correct disputes about\nfirst order dao.\n3.3 Pre-Laozi Daoist Theory\n\nWe have alluded to the earliest known \u201chistory of thought\u201d\nin ancient China comprising Chapter 33 (Tianxiaunder\nheaven) of the Zhuangzi. It\nsurveys the streams of thought leading from the \u201cancients\u201d\n(the Chinese golden age?) to Zhuangzi. After introducing the idealized\nancient dao, it implies a \u201cfall,\u201d then lists a\nseries of groups of thinkers, each striving for impartial objectivity,\nleading eventually to a Laozi group and then to Zhuangzi. \n\nThe list takes key thinkers to be motivated by goals of neutrality,\nuniversality, freedom from bias and natural \u201cspontaneity\u201d\nin action. The list starts with a group that includes Mozi (universal,\nimpartial utilitarians), then discusses anti-conventionalists headed\nby Song Xing, third came Shen Dao\u2019s group (metaphysical anti-knowledge\nstoics), then Laozi and Zhuangzi. Its last topic however is not\nZhuangzi but his friend and frequent philosophical debating companion,\nHui Shi, who along with other members of the school of\n names,\n is introduced mainly for condemnation as if (contrary to all other\nevidence) he were irrelevant to the motivation and understanding of\nZhuangzi\u2019s thought. Clearly, we can use this history only with some\ncaution. It does serve as a \u201cmanifest history of thought\u201d\nthat helps us appreciate the philosophical agenda of the writer. We,\nhowever, must blend this internal Daoist history with external\ninformation about these groups and their thought to get a plausible\nexplanatory justification for the classic Zhuangzi position. \n\nInitially, it is a surprise to see Mozi listed as a\n\u201cforerunner\u201d of Daoism since in many respects, passages in\nthe Zhuangzi take the Mohist dispute with Confucianism as a\ncritical target (examples of question-begging rival first-order\ntheories of dao). However, in both our theoretical senses,\nDaoism could be said to have roots in the anti-Confucian Mozi\n(5th Century BCE). First, his early challenge to\nConfucianism initiated higher level philosophical reflections on\ndao, its role and the kind of thinking it involved. Mozi, for\nexample, theorized that a dao should be constant, not a\nmatter of a special history or arbitrary social convention. He\nsupported his use of a utilitarian standard to evaluate social\ndaos on grounds of the impartiality and constancy of the\nbenefit-harm distinction. He taught this \u201cconstant\u201d\nfeature of utilitarianism was evidence that it was\ntiannature\u2019s standard. He\nthought of this as an objective fastandard\nfor making shi-feithis-not\nthis distinctions.\n\nMozi\u2019s challenge to Confucianism focused on his crucial insight that\nthe fact that traditional norms are our own, do not warrant taking\nthem as correct. Mozi thus launched the meta-search for a way\nimpartially to select a first-order dao. He\nformulates the initial version of the goal of unbiased, constant\nuniversality in morality. Both of these results, further, involved\nimportant theoretical insights into the concept of dao. The\nMohists developed much of the terminology of analysis that other\nChinese thinkers, including Mencius and Zhuangzi, adopted. (See\n Concepts.)\n Zhuangzi deployed this language with considerable skill in his\nskeptical undermining of all claims to special moral authority. \n\nHowever, Mohism did advocate a first order normative dao and\nfollowed Confucianism in the assumption that an orderly society needs\nto follow a single constant dao. Though they\ndeveloped an account of how to justify a dao and first\nformulated the standard of dao adequacy (constancy). What\nthey did not notice was that those standards constituted a\nmeta-dao\u2014a dao for selecting and interpreting\na first-order dao. This reflects their failure to reflect on the\nnature of dao, and then to address whether and how such a\ndao was knowable. They disagreed with Confucianism mainly on\nthe content of the daoguide\nto be imposed on society by authority while addressing only from their\nown perspective how that disagreement should be resolved. Theoretical\nDaoism focused on the insolubility of this ru-moConfucian-Mohist\ndebate.\n\nWe know far less of the doctrine of the next figure cited in the\ndevelopment\u2014Song Xing. Our main sources are the\nZhuangzi description here and a lengthy attack on Song Xing\nin the Xunzi . He is said to have specialized in a theory of\nthe xinheart-mind and to\nhave argued that socialization in conventional attitudes injected\ndestructive values into the heart. The qingpre-social\nyudesires\nare relatively few and easy to satisfy.\nSocialization creates a plethora of desires for \u201csocial\ngoods\u201d such as status, reputation, and pride. Song Xin suggested\nthat the conventional values, because of their social,\ncomparative nature incite competition and then violence. The\nway to social order is for people to eliminate these socialize\nambitions, which create attitudes of resentment and anger. Hence his\nslogan that being insulted (conventional value) is no\n(qingreal) disgrace. The\nslogan aims to eliminate the violence occasioned by \u201chonor and\nmoral rectitude.\u201d In effect, names do not harm me. \n\nMozi had also seen different daos as a source of conflict,\nbut advocated unifying the social dao rather than abandoning\nit. The abandonment theme is developed with some skill in Laozi\u2019s\nDaode Jing. It has roots in the search for impartiality and\nuniversality that also motivated Mozi since it contrasts changeable\nsocial values with pre-social or natural ones. The theme,\nhowever can have both elitist, dogmatic and supernatural elaborations.\nWe might treat the ability to forget social conditioning (returning to\nnature) as something only some are capable of, ignore the\nself-rebutting threat of the attempt, and romanticize the abilities or\nmoral purity that would result from removing socialization. \n\nZhuangzi built on a related view\u2014that people develop different\nmoral attitudes from different natural upbringings and each\nfeels his own views are obvious and natural. But his version\ntreats all as equally natural, not regarding some as more able than\nothers to avoid being \u201cblinded by socialization.\u201d Zhuangzi\nalso adopts a closely related view of how xinheart-mind\nis shaped by socialization. So there\nis a role for Song Xing, along with Mozi in the motivations for Daoist\ntheorizing. However, again we find little hint that Song Xing\nreflected on the concept of dao itself and how it is involved\nin this analysis of how society injects attitudes into\nxinheart-mind.\n\nThe first plausible candidate for a theoretical Daoist comes next in\nthe Zhuangzi historical survey. We will pick Shen Dao as the\nbest-known representative of this group of scholars. He is sometimes\nincluded in the list of Huang-Lao thinkers and cited as a source of\nLegalist thinking. We will not attempt here to reconcile this latter\nwith the essentially Daoist view presented in the Zhuangzi\nhistory. Shen Dao\u2019s theory (perhaps unwittingly) lays the foundation\nfor Daoism\u2019s rejecting the authority of tiannature:sky\nin favor of daoguide:way.\n(In religious language, we can\ndescribe this as worshipping daoguide\nrather than tiannature:sky.)\nThe key insight here is that (like\nGod and Nature) appeal to tiannature:sky\nis normatively empty. All authority\npresupposes some daoguide.\n(God\u2019s moral authority presupposes we accept a dao of\n\u201cobey God.\u201d) The Later\n Mohists[5]\n dialecticians also noticed this problem. They even more clearly argue\nthat the appeal to tiannature:sky\ncould justify the thief as well as\nthe sage. \n\nHere is the Zhuangzi \u201cTianxia\u201d account of Shen\nDao\u2019s group: \n\n\nFor the general public, not cliques; changing and without selfishness;\ndecisive but without any control; responsive to things without\ndividing in two. Not absorbed with reflection. Not calculating in\nknowing how. Not choosing among natural kinds and flowing along with\nthem. \n\nThey took bonding all the natural kinds together as the key. They\nsaid, \u201ctiannature:sky\nconstancies can cover but cannot sustain; Earthly cycles can sustain\nbut cannot cover it. Great daoguide\ncan embrace it but cannot distinguish\nit.\u201d We know the myriad natural kinds all have both that which\nis acceptable and that which is unacceptable. So they said, \u201cIf\nyou select then you cannot be comprehensive, if you teach you cannot\nconvey all of it. Daoguide\ndoes not leave anything out.\u201d \n\nHence Shen Dao \u201cabandoned knowledge and discarded\n\u2018self\u2019.\u201d He flowed with the inevitable and was\nindifferent to natural kinds \u2026 . He lived together with\nshi and fei, mixed acceptable and avoidable. He\ndidn\u2019t treat knowing and deliberation as guides, didn\u2019t know front\nfrom back. He was indifferent to everything. \n\nIf he was pushed he went, if pulled he followed\u2014like a leaf\nwhirling in the stream, like a feather in a wind, like dust on a\nmillstone. He was complete and distinguished (fei) nothing\n\u2026 . So he said, \u201creach for being like things without\nknowledge of what to do. Don\u2019t use worthies and sages. Even a clod of\nearth cannot miss Dao.\u201d \n\nThe worthy officials all laughed at him and said, \u201cShen Dao\u2019s\ndao does not lead to the conduct of a living man but the tendency of a\ndead man. It is really very strange\u2026 .\u201d\n(Zhuangzi Ch. 33)\n\n\nShen Dao\u2019s conception of great dao reminds us of the\nactual world among possible worlds\u2014it is the actual history of\nthe universe. Shen Dao avers that there is just one such total\nhistory\u2014one actual past and one actual future. The actual is,\nobviously, natural so the great dao (the natural pattern of\nbehaviors, events and processes) requires no learning, no knowledge,\nno language or shi-feithis-not\nthis distinctions. \u201cEven a clod of earth cannot\nmiss the great dao.\u201d Shen Dao\u2019s insight undermines all these\nguiding schemes that claim tiannature\u2019s\napproval as justification. The crucial\nimplication of his approach is that great dao has no\nnormative force. To say \u201cfollow great daoguide\u201d\nis as trivial as \u201cdo what\nyou actually will do.\u201d When we think of dao as the\nactual course of all nature, it is obvious we will follow it.\n\n\nThis reasoning drives Shen Dao\u2019s slightly different stoicism. His\nslogan was \u201cabandon knowledge; discard self.\u201d\n\u201cAbandon knowledge\u201d means do not guide your behavior using\nprescriptive discourse\u2014a learned daoguide.\n\u201cDiscard self\u201d\nprescribes the corollary that even Yang Zhu\u2019s dao of\nself-preservation is not natural. Our death is part of great\ndao\u2014down to its very moment. Egoistic guidance is a\ndaoguide similarly\ncommitted to right-wrong, normative guiding distinctions rooted in a\ndistinction between \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019. It\nrecommends a particular possible future history. So to abandon\nknowledge is to also discard \u2018self\u2019 as a\nprescriptive term\u2014to give up using \u2018self-other\u2019 as a\nguiding distinction. Yangzhu\u2019s egoism violates Shen Dao\u2019s\nanti-language naturalism as much as does Confucius\u2019s traditionalism or\nMozi\u2019s utilitarianism.\n\nWhy does Shen Dao think we should give up guiding ourselves by shared\nmoral prescriptions? His stoic attitude and some of his slogans\nsuggest that like the Stoics, he was a fatalist. However Shen Dao\u2019s\nargument has no predictive capacity or law-like basis. It is simply\nlogical determinism: \u201cwhat will be will be.\u201d The account\nabove also has no hint of any concept of free will, but Shen Dao does\nadvocate a parallel to giving up moral responsibility. We should not\nmake shi-feithis-not this\njudgments. Consequently, he should not be saying that we\nshould follow the great dao, because that would be to\nshithis:right whatever\nactually happens. He avoids this inconsistency and thus is not\ncommitted to the Stoic view that the natural/actual course of events\nis rational or good. It simply happens.\n\nHowever, another inconsistency is rampant in Shen Dao\u2019s theory of\ngreat dao. In using the notion of the actual dao to motivate\navoiding any prescriptive discourse, Shen Dao is saying to Confucians\nand Mohists, \u201cif you allege to speak for the nature of things,\nsay nothing!\u201d Nature does not prescribe. What about Shen Dao\u2019s\nnaturalism itself, however? Is it other than \u201cnatural\u201d\n(and part of great dao) that humans use language to\ncoordinate behavior, to order their interactions, to accumulate and\ntransmit knowledge? Further, his injunction against shi-fei judgments\nis an injunction\u2014a negative prescription. His\n\u201cslogan\u201d is expressed as a guide, as something we can\nlearn and follow. \u201cAbandon knowledge\u201d amounts to a\nprescriptive paradox. The concept of knowledge it uses is prescriptive\nknowledge. In form and intent, it is a prescription\u2014a\ndaoguide. If we obey it, we\ndisobey it. This is our first example of Daoist paradox! Shen Dao\u2019s\ndaoguide is a\ndaoguide that can\u2019t\ndaoguide us. \n\nThe Zhuangzi history, where we find this account of Shen\nDao\u2019s doctrine, criticizes Shen Dao\u2019s position along these lines.\nStill, it places Shen Dao in the dialectic just before Laozi, who\ndirectly precedes Zhuangzi. Laozi has a different line of reasoning to\n\u201cabandon knowledge.\u201d He avoids the fatalist\nimplications\u2014and, with it implicitly, the concept of great\ndao as a guide (though he keeps tiannature\u2019s\ndao). We can view the Laozi\npersona as combining Song Xing and Shen Dao. His reason to\n\u201cabandon knowledge\u201d is that knowledge is a form of social\ncontrol that instills unnatural desires, stimulates\nunnatural action thus it constrains and distorts natural\nspontaneity. The Zhuangzi ordering is theoretically\ninformative, though chronologically inaccurate.\n4. Dao and Names: The Laozi or Daode Jing\n\nWe will discuss, here, mainly the contributions the Laozi\nmakes to this Daoist dialectic. For a more complete and detailed\ntreatment of the philosophy of the text, see the entry under Laozi.\n\n\nThe Zhuangzi history lists Laozi (along with Guan Yin)\nbetween Shen Dao and Zhuangzi. Whatever its actual date and manner of\ncomposition, the Laozi is assigned a role in the development\nof Zhuangzi\u2019s thought that best fits in that slot. The most famous\nline of Daoist meta-theory of dao opens the Daode\nJing. \u201cDao that can be dao-ed is not\nconstant dao.\u201d Though the text betrays no hint of\nexposure to the\n School of Names,\n this famous slogan is duplicated with mingname\nreplacing dao. It thus shifts the\nfocus of meta-discourse about dao from grounding its\nauthority in nature to issues of language and the role of\nmingwords in\ndao-ing. Since words are not constant, no dao that\ncan be conveyed using words can be.\n\nWhat is being denied in saying such dao are not\n constant?\n The text does not elaborate on the concept, however the issue in\nancient Chinese thought emerges as the crux of the dispute between\nMohists and Confucians. Mohists attempted to regiment the debate by\ninsisting on fastandards\nfor interpreting guiding language. They argued tiannature:sky\u2019s\nstandard lies in the distinction\nbetween benefit and harm\u2014which was by association a\nconstant standard. The writers of the Confucian\nAnalects inclined toward a notion of an administrator\n\u201crectifying names.\u201d A name is rectified when an\ninstruction containing it (a ritual or a law) correctly\nguides peoples action. \u201cIf names are not rectified \u2026\npeople will not know how to move hand or foot\u201d\n(Analects 13:3). The typical Confucian way of\nrectifying a name is to set an example\u2014either of correct use of\nthe term or correct action in following a dao that contains\nthe term. \n\nSo what is Laozi denying when he is made to say \u201cnames that can\nbe named are not\n constant\nnames?\u201d The skepticism here can be read in two ways. One\nis there is no correct way to use a name so contrary to\nMohism, no standard is \u201cnature\u2019s\u201d constant standard of\nchoice of a dao. The other reading is interpretive\u2014no\npattern of correct past use (no social practice) uniquely determines\nwhat concrete behavior counts as correct here-now (or in\nthe future). So, as Mozi had argued, tradition cannot determine\nwhat is the correct dao, but, the Laozi seems to\nadd, that is so even presupposing a tradition. There is no\nconstant (correct) way to interpret that\npractice/dao into action.\n\nThe negative result may be read in several ways. \n\nIt may be pure nihilism\u2014there is no such thing as correct\ndao.\nIt may be skepticism\u2014correct dao can never be\nknown;\nOr as anti-language\u2014correct dao cannot be put in\nwords or conveyed as guidance to another. \n\n\nThe second and third are compatible with their being a correct or\nconstant dao and the third even with someone\u2019s\nknowing it. It simply cannot be conveyed. The rest of the\ntext\u2014the very fact that there is more to the text\u2014makes\nthese two readings, particularly the last, the most common ones.\nHowever the traditional story of Laozi undermines the argument for\nplacing too much emphasis on the fact that after this opening stanza,\nhe goes on to write a text. It suggests that he writes only\nbecause compelled to do so by the keeper of the pass. \n\nAdopting readings 2 or 3 doesn\u2019t remove all paradox from Laozi\u2019s\nposition. Laozi is still left with his variation on Shen Dao\u2019s\n\u201cabandon knowledge.\u201d The text, however, does develop a\ndifferent motivation for it. We find few traces of Shen Dao\u2019s\nfatalistic or stoic reasoning. Laozi\u2019s opposition to knowledge derives\nmore from Song Xing\u2019s insights about how social knowledge shapes our\nvalues and desires. We can attribute to the Laozi the next\ndevelopment in Chinese pragmatics of language, how language shapes\naction.\n\nLaozi draws illustrations using ming (word)\npairs\u2014opposites. He draws analogies between naming and cutting\nor \u201ccarving\u201d (hence the symbol of the nameless\n pusimplicity\u2014uncarved,\nraw wood). When we\nlearn a way of using a word (e.g. watching teachers\n\u201crectify\u201d names) we internalize a community practice of\n\u201ccutting\u201d stuff and assigning names to the portions. This\nis how we pick out how to act\u2014what to pick up, put down, go\ntoward and so on. We interpret a dao by dividing\nthings up into types. We learn this in concrete practice as we avoid\nor pursue the things named. Thus, with the names we acquire a\ndisposition to behavior toward that type\u2014we acquire a socialized\nvalue or desire for one of the two discriminants. These acquired\ndesires then shape our weideeming:action.\n\n\nMuch of the further reasoning found in the Laozi follows that\nof Song Xing. The artificially created desires lead to unnecessary\ncompetition and strife. When we see that they are not natural,\nacquiring socialized desires (e.g. for status, reputation, for rare\nobjects) starts to look ill advised. He hints at places that acquiring\nthe system of names dulls our capacity for appreciation or reaction to\nnature\u2014\u201cthe five colors blind the eye \u2026\u201d\n(Daode Jing Ch. 12). And most important, acquiring knowledge\nin this way is losing the natural spontaneity and becoming subject to\nsocial control. \n\nThe text, accordingly, entices us to free ourselves from this system\nsignified by the slogan wu-weilack-action.\nWe are to set about forgetting all\nour socialization and return to the state of a newborn babe. The\nslogan is famously paradoxical and is even formulated in the text in a\nparadoxical way\u2014\u201clack acting and yet lack\n\u2018don\u2019t-act\u2019.\u201d \n\nThe bulk of the Daode Jing is thus given over to motivating\nthis paradoxical attitude. Its familiar strategy centers on the notion\nof \u201creversal.\u201d In passage after passage, advice is given\nthat reverses conventional values (usu. in Confucian-Mohist\ndiscourse)\u2014either rejecting the usual positive value term\n(benevolence, sages, morality, social activism) or motivating valuing\nthe opposite (non-being, water, the female, the lower position etc.).\n\n\nThe result is a fascinating exercise in normative advocacy including\nLaozi\u2019s famous political theory\u2014which you can find elaborated\nmore fully in the Laozi entry. Clearly, such advocacy is inconsistent\nwith the meta-theory and its purpose must be indirect\u2014perhaps to\ninduce us to \u201csee\u201d one of the three negative positions\nconsidered above. Still it gives the text a tone that we referred to\nabove as primitivism\u2014nullifying socialization and cultivating\nonly the \u201cnatural\u201d attitudes and actions.\n5. Impact of the School of Names\n\nOne stark difference between the two main texts of Daoism is the\nrelation to the School of Names. The Laozi, though clearly\nhaving a theory of the pragmatics of naming, betrays neither exposure\nto the doctrines nor the analytical terminology developed by the\ndialectical Mohists for dealing with theory of language. The\nZhuangzi clearly does reveal that exposure. To understand\nthis phase in the development of Daoism, we note briefly what the\noutstanding linguistic issues were and how they were formulated, then\nwe will look at the implications of Daoist\nresponses\u2014particularly those found in the Zhuangzi.\n\n\nThe focus on mingwords:names\ngrows from recognizing the\ninterpretive problem concerning acting on some guide. The disputes\nabout dao are intimately tied to issues about words\u2014in\nparticular, what is to count as a correct use and what action or\nobjects count as following the guidance.\n\nThe early Mohists advocated using a utilitarian standard to determine\nboth the correct application of words to actions and the choice of\nword order in social guiding discourse. \u201cWhich dao\nshould we follow\u201d became \u201cwhich words shall we use to\nsocialize people and how should we interpret the words of social\nguiding discourse in guiding our behavior?\u201d In effect, the early\nMohist answer to both questions is settled by making allegedly\n\u201cnatural\u201d distinctions between benefit and harm. Thus\nlanguage content and conventions of interpretation should be governed\nby the utility principle.\n\nLater Mohists formulated a more \u201crealistic\u201d theory of what\ncounts as the normatively correct way to use names. We should mark the\ndistinctions that underlie names in ways that trace patterns of\nobjective similarity and difference in things. This realism governs\nthe correct ways both to use terms and to interpret them. We rely on\nutility to determine how we structure terms into strings in\nguidance\u2014in discourse dao . So, for example, a thief is\na man\u2014is governed by the rules of similarity. Still, we allow\nguidance that includes both the guiding strings \u201cdon\u2019t kill\nmen\u201d and \u201cyou may kill thieves.\u201d \n\nThis realism led the later Mohists to linguistic conclusions that\nchallenged any anti-language attitude\u2014including those expressed\nby early Daoists. First, the later Mohists argued that in any\ndisagreement about how to distinguish realities with names, there was\na right answer. It may, however, be hard to know or prove. So, for\nexample, if we are disputing about whether to use \u201cox\u201d or\n\u201cnon-ox\u201d of some obscure object, one of the answers will\nbe correct. This undermines both the nihilistic and the anti-language\noptions to understanding Laozi. Second, Mohists argued that any\nattempt to formulate the anti-language position was self condemning.\n\u201cAll language is bad\u201d must be a \u201cbad\u201d thing to\nsay.\n\nOther figures classified in the School of Names responded to the\nMohist realists. Gongsun Long (mentioned sporadically in the\nZhuangzi) took himself to be defending Confucian accounts of\nrectifying names and Hui Shi constructs what looks like a relativist\nchallenge to Later Mohist accounts. We will look only at Hui Shi\u2019s\naccount here because he plays such a significant role in the text of\nthe Zhuangzi .\n\nHui Shi implicitly addressed the claim that the correct use of words\ndepends on objective patterns of similarity and difference. What we\nknow of his writings (which the Zhuangzi history suggests\nwere prodigious) is mainly a sequence of theses cited at the end of\nthe Zhuangzi history. These focused on propositions about\ncomparative \u201cnames\u201d\u2014e.g., large and small. Clearly\nsome things properly termed \u2018large\u2019 are objectively\nsmaller than other things properly called \u2018small\u2019. A small\nelephant is considerably larger than a huge ant! So correct naming\nmust not be based on objective distinctions in the world, but on our\nprojections from a point of view or purpose in using them. Similarly,\n\u2018tall\u2019, \u2018short\u2019, and time words (e.g.,\n\u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019, \u2018today\u2019 and\n\u2018tomorrow\u2019) are implausibly attributed to objective\ndistinctions\n\nFrom this, according to the list of propositions in the\nZhuangzi history, Hui Shi apparently concluded that we can\ncluster things in arbitrary ways. This insight is not taken to be\nabout sets and members, but about divisions into parts and wholes. So\nwe can speak of a great \u201cone\u201d that is a kind of everything\nconcept\u2014nothing lies outside it and of a small \u201cone\u201d\nwhich cannot be further distinguished or divided. Objectively there\nare no distinctions\u2014the cosmos is one, and we should direct the\nsame guiding attitudes toward the whole\u2014\u201clove all things\nequally.\u201d\n6. Mature Daoism: The Zhuangzi\n\nFrom internal evidence, we would judge Hui Shi to have had much more\ninfluence on Zhuangzi than his knowledge of Laozi or of the contents\nof the Daode Jing as we know it. Hui Shi appears more often\nin dialogue with Zhuangzi than any other figure and in ways that\nsuggest a long-term philosophical involvement and interaction, like\nrelationship of philosophical\n friends.[6]\n And, as we observed, the inner chapters of the Zhuangzi show\nmastery of the technical terminology and state of the art theories of\nlanguage in ancient China. Still the tone seems \u201cDaoist\u201d\nin the senses we\u2019ve identified. Zhuangzi marks the high point of\nmature Daoist philosophical theory as he finds a better way to answer\nlater Mohist challenges than did Hui Shi. \n\nZhuangzi finds a \u201cnaturalist\u201d position that coherently\nexplains why dao has normative priority over\ntiannature:sky. The way to\navoid the anti-language trap is:\n\nTo acknowledge that language is natural, which Zhuangzi does in\nhis beloved image of the \u201cpipes of tiannature:sky.\u201d\n\nTo resist concluding that, in being natural, all language is right\nor permissible. \n\n\nThe first may superficially appear to give in to the Confucians and\nMohists\u2014allowing them to claim that tiannature\u2019s\nendorses their respective social\nways. However, its Daoist thrust consists in depriving the\nabsolutists of what they really want\u2014the ability to\ndeclare that their opponent violates tiannature:sky\nor lacks its similar approval. The\nstrategy draws on the correct lesson to be learned from Shen Dao\u2019s\nnotion of great dao\u2014that \u201cfollow nature\u201d\nhas no normative significance. \n\nWe can only answer normative questions from within dao, not\nfrom the perspective of nature or any other authority. The point is\nthat \u2018authority\u2019 is a normative concept within some\ndao so any appeal presupposes a dao of following it.\nThus Zhuangzi\u2019s first step does not warrant treating all discourse\ndao as right or as wrong\u2014or even as equal. We make\nnormative or evaluative judgments only against the background of a\npresupposed way of justifying and interpreting them. The judgments\ndepend on some discourse dao.\n\nThe priority of dao over tiannature:sky\nunderwrites the themes of dependency\nand relativism that pervade the Zhuangzi and ultimately the\nskepticism, the open-minded toleration and the political anarchism (or\ndisinterest in political activity or involvement). Yet, while nature\nis not a standard, Daoism does countenance natural daos.\nMohism had presupposed one (a natural impulse to benefit) as had the\nConfucian intuitionist, Mencius (a natural moral tendency in the\nheart-mind). Zhuangzi\u2019s accepts there must be some natural or\n innate guides,\n but notes:\n\nThere are many such natural ways, and \nWe presuppose further ways when we choose among natural\nones as we do again when we cultivate them in one way rather\nthan another.\n\n\nSo the dependence on dao multiplies endlessly. The\nZhuangzi hints at this in a famous image, humans live and act\nin ways as fish live and act in water. We don\u2019t notice in how many\nways we depend on ways. Being in a sea of ways is\nbeing human. (This insight has inspired many writers to draw a\nparallel with Heidegger\u2019s Dasein.) We cannot get outside of\ndao to any more ultimate kind of authority. \n\nThese meta-reflections inform relativist (perspectival or pluralist)\nand skeptical themes in the inner chapters of the Zhuangzi.\nThe style furthers both themes. Rather than speaking with an authorial\nvoice, the text is filled with fantasy conversations between\nperspectives, including those of millipedes, convicts, musicians and\nthe wind. A Zhuangzi reflective passage is more likely to end\nwith a double rhetorical question (\u201cis it \u2026 or isn\u2019t it\n\u2026 ?\u201d) than a strong conclusion. \n\nDoes Zhuangzi then have anything to teach us? His is an example of the\nkey lesson\u2014open-minded receptivity to all the different voices\nof dao\u2014particularly those who have run afoul of human\nauthority or seem least authoritative. Each actual (naturally)\nexisting dao has insights. They may be surprisingly\nvaluable\u2014as viewed from within our different ways. On\nthe flip side, we gain nothing from trying to imagine a perfect or\nultimate source of guidance. If there were a perfect man or ideal\nobserver-actor, we probably could not understand him. Would his ways\nhave any relevance for us with our limits? Perfection may well look\nlike its opposite to us. \n\nLaozi may have been tempted to postulate a perfect dao. It\nwould be a dao with no social contribution. So the\nZhuangzi differs in this important attitude from the\nLaozi\u2014we need not try to escape from social life and\nconventions. Conventions underlie the possibility of communication and\nare, thus, useful. This gives Zhuangzi\u2019s Daoism less of the primitive\nthrust of the Daode Jing (the term wu-wei virtually\ndisappears in the inner chapters). \n\nThe most dramatic message of the Zhuangzi is a theme that\nlinks Daoism to Zen (Chan\u2014the distinctively Daoist influenced\nbranch of Buddhism)\u2014the \u201cmysticism\u201d of losing\noneself in activity, particularly the absorption in skilled execution\nof a highly cultivated way . His most famous example concerns\na butcher\u2014hardly a prestige or status profession\u2014who\ncarves beef with the focus and absorption of a virtuoso dancer in an\nelegantly choreographed performance. The height of human satisfaction\ncomes in achieving and exercising such skills with the focus and\ncommitment that gets us \u201coutside ourselves\u201d and into such\nan intimate connection with our dao . \n\nOther examples include lute players, cicada catchers, wheelwrights and\nlogicians. Each description has a hint of realism in the recognition\nwe must put in effort to acquire the skills and then to convert them\nto \u201csecond nature.\u201d We come to see them as natural and as\nourselves being at one with nature. Yet in the throes of skillful\nperformance, we still can perfect them more and no matter how good we\nmay become at one thing, may be miserable at others\u2014particularly\nat conveying the skills to others.\n\nFinally politically, Zhuangzi famously prefers fishing to high status\nand political office. He asks what a turtle would choose if offered\nthe option of being nailed in a place of veneration an honor in some\nplace of worship or staying at the lake and \u201cdragging his tail\nin the mud.\u201d However this anti-political stance is unlikely to\nbe grounded in simple self-preservation. The openness of Zhuangzi\u2019s\npluralism does undermine the justification of political authority that\nwas assumed in ancient China. Confucians and Mohists disagreed\nbitterly about what dao to follow in a society, but agreed\nwithout question that proper order was achieved only when a society\nfollowed a single dao . Zhuangzi\u2019s stance suggests that\nsociety could function with people following many ways of acting.\nNothing requires suppressing or eliminating a dao that works from some\npoint of view. \n\nThe Zhuangzi text, as we noted, contains the writings of a\nrange of thinkers loosely allied with these Daoist themes. Large\nsections lean toward the primitivism of Laozi and others emphasize the\nrelativism, and still others become eclectic and uncritical in their\nopenness. For a more complete account see the entry on Zhuangzi and\n Texts and Textual Theory\n below.\n7. Neo-Daoism\n\nThe establishment of an authoritarian empire and the long-lived but\nphilosophically dogmatic (Confucian) Han dynasty temporarily drained\nthe vibrancy from Chinese philosophical thought. Classical Daoist\nphilosophy was successfully extinguished by the imperial suppression\nof analytic thought. Confucian authoritarians like Xunzi argued that\nanalysis of names leads to confusion and disorder. The substitution of\nthe Qin ruler\u2019s superstitious search for long life through alchemy and\nhis consequent fostering of Huang-Lao religion combined with\nsuppression of dialectic thought initiated China\u2019s philosophical\n\u201cDark Age.\u201d The later substitution of Confucianism as the\nofficial orthodoxy during the Han cemented the intellectual stagnation\nfirmly in place. Only Huang-Lao thinking remained as a live influence\nand archivist of Daoist texts. Its superstitions and cosmologies\nmingled in the emerging eclectic Han-Confucianism. \n\nThe fall of the Han some 400 years later saw the emergence of a\nmodified worldview drawing on the preserved texts which we call\nNeo-Daoism (See Neo-Daoism). Its most influential writers, Wang Bi and\nGuo Xiang who wrote commentaries respectively on the Daode\nJing and the Zhuangzi, were avowed Confucians. Their\nphilosophy reinvested a stoic spirit which they interpreted as the\npoint of their new-Daoism. They expressed their combination of\nConfucian social activity with their version of Daoist quietism in the\nenduring slogan \u201cSage within, king without.\u201d They framed\ntheir Daoism as a kind of inner emptiness or non-commitment coupled\nwith a meticulous conformity to one\u2019s actual role in the\ntimes\u2014whatever fate might have it. Thus they were Confucians on\nthe outside and Daoists inside. This elaborated, for Neo-Daoists, the\nconcept of wu-wei (non-deeming action).\n\nThey buttressed this social stoicism with metaphysical systems focused\non the puzzle of \u201cbeing and non-being.\u201d The drew this\ntopic from one of Laozi\u2019s frequent inclusion of this pair to\nillustrate his contrast theory of language. Trying to figure what the\nbackground of a being and non-being contrast was formed a central\nissue for their \u201cabstruse studies.\u201d Wang Bi (ca. 300) took\nnon-being to be the background and thus to \u201cgive rise to\u201d\nbeing. He interpreted the Laozi alongside a Confucianized\ncosmological divination manual, The Book of Changes (I\nChing or Yijing). The Book of Changes with its\nyin-yang account of change and its generational cosmology\nthus entered the list of Daoist texts and the Daode Jing was\ntransformed in conventional wisdom into a detached cosmology.\n\nWang Bi identified dao with non-being while still treating it\nas the source of all creation\u2014the basic substance (which he\nassociated with the taijiGreat\nultimate of the Yijing).\nWhile the basic substance is nothing, its \u201cfunction\u201d is\nbeing\u2014thus being depends on non-being, from which it is\nconstantly produced as a kaleidoscopic function of an unchanging,\nparadoxical reality of nothing. (The ideal Daoist-Confucian person\nmirrors this cosmology\u2014an expression of being a \u201cSage\nwithin; king without\u201d.)\n\nThe second famous Neo-Daoist, Guo Xiang commented on the\nZhuangzi . His cosmology developed an interesting twist on\nthat of Wang Bi. Non-being, he argued, did not, after all, exist. It\nwas simply nothing and thus could not create anything. Simply put,\nthere is no non-being\u2014there is only being. And so there is no\n\u201cgiving rise to.\u201d Being always was and comes of itself. It\ngenerates and changes itself constantly by the totality the\ninterrelations among its parts. These differences in emphasis partly\nreflect the differences in the original texts\u2014the Daode\nJing\u2019s emphasis on wunon-being-values\nand the Zhuangzi\u2019s\ndiverse pluralism and sense of freedom from any ultimate cosmic source\nof guidance.\n\nPragmatically, the two pictures were not very different. Each still\nhad nothing at the center (Daoist sage) and being (Confucian King)\naround the edges, but Guo Xiang deemphasized any lines of force from\nnon-being to being and emphasized instead the situation and contextual\nrelations within the realm of being. Both similarly read their\ncosmologies as ways of viewing things that support and help achieve\nthe shared lifestyle slogan \u201csage within, king without.\u201d\n\n8. Daoism and Buddhism\n\nBuddhism came to China at a time when the intellectuals were hungry\nfor fresh ideas, but it arrived with massive handicaps. It was saddled\nwith the Indo-European focus on an appearance-reality metaphysics and\nepistemology, with with approximations to concepts of\n\u2018truth\u2019, sense-data experience, mind as a container of a\nsubjective world populated by counterparts of sensible objects,\npropositional knowledge, representational belief, a belief-desire\npsychology together with a logic-informed concept of\n\u2018reason\u2019 as both a human faculty and a property of beliefs\nand concepts. The highly developed Buddhist arguments had little\npurchase on Chinese intellectuals and the only available common form\nof discourse that could \u201cdomesticate\u201d this alien system\nwas Neo-Daoist \u201cabstruse learning\u201d which focused on the\nmetaphysical notions of being and non-being. That issue resonated\nsuperficially with a Buddhist puzzle about the nature of Nirvana. If\nNirvana was the opposite of Samsara (the eternal cycle of rebirth or\nreincarnation) then was it a state of being or of non-being? Nirvana\nis the achievement of the Buddha\u2014the expression of\nBuddha-nature. So the cosmology of this version of Buddhism, like that\nof the Neo-Daoists, aided achievement of some goal. Realization of the\npuzzling nature of this state led to Buddhahood.\n\nMeantime, Buddhism came armed with a paradox that would delight\nthinkers of a Daoist turn of mind\u2014the fabled paradox of desire.\nRebirth was caused by desire and Nirvana could be achieved only by the\ncessation of desire. That meant that in order to achieve Nirvana, one\nhad to cease to want to achieve it. This argument informs the Mahayana\nnotion of a Bodhisattva, who qualifies for Nirvana but voluntarily\nstays behind in the cycle of rebirth to help the rest of us.\nEnlightenment could only be achieved all at once. (This conclusion was\nalso a consequence of the Buddhist view that the ego is an illusion.)\nThe Mahayana wing of Buddhism was the more successful in China because\nthis implicit egalitarianism\u2014everyone could be Buddha, just as\neveryone can be a Daoist or Confucian Sage.\n\nThe other Buddhist philosophy that had the greatest appeal in China\nwas Madyamika, which answered the question of the nature of Nirvana or\nthe Buddha nature by not answering it\u2014Neo-Daoist quietism. The\nrealization of this emptiness was a kind of non-realization, a giving\nup, or an inexpressible, mystical, prajna-knowledge which\ncontrasts with \u201cordinary\u201d knowledge. This helped blend\ndiscussion of dao and Buddha-nature even more and fueled the\neventually widespread Confucian bias that they were the same basic\nreligion.\n\nMeantime, the introduction of a more \u201cWestern\u201d religious\nmodel (monasticism) to China and coincided with the launch of\norganized \u201cDaoist\u201d religions. Modeled thus in style and\nprogressively in content, Daoist religion, the quasi-religious\nNeo-Daoist stoical quietism began to blend with Buddhism. \n\nIn China, the two dominant theoretical Buddhist sects reflect the\ncosmological structures of the two Neo-Daoists. Tian-tai is\n\u201ccenter dominated\u201d with a single thought (the\ninexpressible Madyamika Buddha-nature) determining everything. Hua-yan\nshifts emphasis to the inter-relations of all \u201cdharmas.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a cosmos of interaction that constitutes the expression of Buddha\nnature. \n\nThe most Daoist of Chinese sects is famously the Chan (Japanese\n\u2018Zen\u2019) sect. We can understand its Daoist character by\nreturning to the paradox of desire. Laozi\u2019s analysis says artificial\ndesires are those created by learned distinctions. If we are to\neliminate the desire for Nirvana, it must be by\n\u201cforgetting\u201d the dichotomy of Nirvana-Samsara. This\nrealization is both the inner reality of enlightenment and corresponds\nto a mystical answer to the being/non-being of Nirvana. It underwrites\nthe Chan/Zen emphasis on practice, the here and\nnow\u2014\u201cevery moment Zen\u201d\u2014and the signature\n\u201crealization\u201d that we are already Buddha. The Buddha\nnature is your self-nature\u2014again exemplifying the Neo-Daoist\n\u201cSage within, King without\u201d spirit.\n\nDaoist simplicity stimulated Chan\u2019s abandonment of Buddhist\ntheory and was accompanied by another traditional Daoist\nfeature\u2014the emphasis on total absorption in practice of a highly\ncultivated skill. Chinese Zen was dominated by the notion of\n\u201csudden enlightenment\u201d which consists of the denial that\nany process leads anyone closer to the Buddha-nature. You can\u2019t get\nany closer\u2014you\u2019re just there. Pay attention! \n9. Important Daoist Concepts\n\nSome important concepts that have played a role in the doctrines of\nDaoism are: \n\n9.1 Dao and de : The Ethical Concepts\n\n9.1.1 Dao (Way, Guide, Road)\n9.1.2 De (Virtuosity, Virtue, Power)\n \n9.2 Ming (Name)\n9.3 Chang (Constant)\n9.4 Wei & wu-wei (Deeming Action & Non-deeming Action)\n9.5 Pusimplicity (Pre-linguistic Purity)\n\n9.1 Dao and de: The Ethical Concepts\n9.1.1 Dao (Way, Guide, Road) \u9053\n\nDaoism has a reputation of being impenetrable mainly because of its\ncentral concept, dao. Yet surprisingly, the almost universal\ntranslation in English uses one of the smallest, simplest, most\nfamiliar and least consciously noticed terms of the\nlanguage\u2014\u2018way.\u2019 This common translation,\n\u2018way\u2019, is apt in several ways. Dao (Tao) is a\npivotal concept of ancient Chinese thought. \u2018Way\u2019 is\nsimilarly primitive (it resists analytic definition). We can only\noffer synonyms: e.g., \u2018course\u2019, \u2018method\u2019,\n\u2018manner\u2019, \u2018mode\u2019, \u2018style\u2019,\n\u2018means\u2019, \u2018practice\u2019, \u2018fashion\u2019,\n\u2018technique\u2019 and so on. We discover the circularity when we\ntry to analyze one of the synonyms without recourse to the term\n\u2018way\u2019 with which we began.\n\nThe partial synonyms, however, remind us of a second way in which\n\u2018way\u2019 is an apt translation of dao. A way is the\nanswer to a \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhat-to-do\u201d question. We\ntypically use talk of ways in advising someone. Ways are deeply\npractical (i.e., prescriptive or normative). \n\nDao is also used concretely to refer to a road or path in Chinese,\ne.g., Queen\u2019s Road. Again, \u2018way\u2019 fits this metaphorical\nrole\u2014as in highway and Broadway. In figurative\nEnglish use they are interchangeable\u2014the road/way to salvation.\nRoads guide us and facilitate our arrival at a desired destination.\nThey are, as it were, physically real guiding or\nprescriptive structures.\n\nThough practical, describing something as a dao or a way need\nnot be to recommend it. The Zhuangzi reminds us that thievery\nhas a dao . We can use both dao and\n\u2018way\u2019 mainly to describe\u2014as when a Confucian\nundertakes to pursue his father\u2019s dao for three years after\nhis death or we say \u201cI saw the way you did that.\u201d \n\nThere are interesting differences between dao and\n\u2018way\u2019. Chinese nouns lack pluralization, so dao\nfunctions grammatically like a singular or mass term and semantically\nlike a plural. The first tempts translators to render all occurrences\nas \u201cthe way.\u201d One is better advised to treat\ndao as a collective noun\u2014as the part-whole sum of ways.\nWhat we think of as one way would be one\npart of dao. \n\nWe partition dao by modification. So we can talk about, e.g.,\nmy-dao, Sage-King\u2019s-dao, natural-dao,\npast-time\u2019s-dao and so forth. This feature explains why\ndao appears more metaphysical than \u2018way\u2019 and\ninvites the familiar Daoist spatial metaphors like \u201chumans\ninteract in dao as fish do in water\u201d (Zhuangzi\nCh. 6). Dao is a little like the\nwater\u2014an expanse constituting the realm in which humans live,\nwork and play. To be human is to be in a realm of ways to guide us.\nDaoists are more likely to play with these metaphysical metaphors than\nare Confucians or Mohists\u2014who mainly point to (their favored\npart of) dao. \n\nAnother difference is that while both dao and\n\u2018way\u2019 are almost ineliminable terms in their respective\nlanguages, We have hardly noticed the word \u2018way\u2019 in\nphilosophy. It\u2019s barely visible in the history of Western\nphilosophy\u2014more like a bit of grammatical filler. Western\nphilosophers have endlessly analyzed and dissected a cluster of terms\nthought to be central to our thinking, e.g., \u2018good\u2019,\n\u2018right\u2019, \u2018being\u2019 (to be), \u2018know\u2019,\n\u2018believe\u2019, \u2018true\u2019, \u2018beautiful\u2019,\n\u2018reason\u2019, \u2018change\u2019, \u2018subject\u2019,\n\u2018mind\u2019, \u2018meaning\u2019, \u2018refer\u2019,\n\u2018object\u2019, \u2018property\u2019, and so forth. Some\ntrends have focused on sub-types and partial counterparts like\n\u2018methods\u2019, \u2018modes\u2019, \u2018practices\u2019,\n\u2018manners\u2019, \u2018plans\u2019 and in some sense even\n\u2018forms\u2019. Yet one looks in vain to find a Western\nphilosopher showering her analytic attention on the more general\nconcept of \u2018way\u2019. \n\nDao, by contrast, was the center of Chinese\nphilosophical discussion. It occupies the position at the center of\nthought that in Western philosophy is filled by terms like\n\u2018being\u2019 or \u2018truth\u2019. The centrality tempts\ninterpreters to identify dao with the central concepts of the\nWestern philosophical agenda, but that is to lose the important\ndifference between the two traditions. Metaphysics and epistemology\ndominated early Western philosophy while ethics, politics and\nphilosophy of education/psychology dominated Chinese thought. Although\nit\u2019s insightful to say humans live in dao as fish do in\nwater, the insight is lost if we simply treat dao as being or\nsome pantheistic spiritual realm. Dao remains essentially a\nconcept of guidance, a prescriptive or normative term. In the late\nClassical period, dao paired with devirtuosity\nto form the Chinese term for\n\u2018ethics\u2019 \u201cdao-de.\u201d Dao is\nthe pivot of Chinese philosophy\u2014but it still translates as\n\u2018way\u2019, not \u2018being\u2019.\n\nA third difference is that unlike \u2018way\u2019, dao may\nbe used as a verb. The best known example is the famous first line of\nthe Daode Jing. Literally \u201cdao can be\ndao not constant dao.\u201d For the dao in\nthe middle of the three daos in the passage, roughly one out\nof three translators uses \u2018speak\u2019, another third use\n\u2018tell\u2019 and the rest use near synonyms such as\n\u2018expressed\u2019, \u201cdefined in words\u201d, or\n\u2018stated\u2019. In a famous Confucian example of this use,\nConfucius criticizes dao-ing the people with laws rather than\ndao-ing them with ritual. (This verbal sense is now often\nmarked by a graphic variation daoto\ndirect).\n\nThroughout classical texts, we find that daos are spoken,\nheard, forgotten, transmitted, learned, studied, understood and\nmisunderstood, distorted, mastered, and performed with pleasure.\nDifferent countries and historical periods have different\ndao. Footprints of the linguistic component of the concept of\ndao are scattered through all kinds of modern Chinese\ncompound words. \u2018Preach\u2019 is jiang-dao\u2014speak a\ndao. To know is to know a dao. The character\ndao is part of compounds translated as\n\u2018doctrine\u2019, \u2018truth\u2019, \u2018principle\u2019,\n\u2018law\u2019 and of course, \u2018morality\u2019 or\n\u2018ethics\u2019, \u2018reason\u2019, \u2018religion\u2019,\n\u2018philosophy\u2019, \u2018orthodoxy\u2019,\n\u2018thank\u2019, \u2018apologize\u2019, \u2018tell\u2019,\n\u2018explain\u2019, \u2018inform\u2019 and so on. \n\nIs \u2018speak\u2019 the right way to translate these verbal uses of\ndao? It is in some ways too narrow and in others too broad.\nWe can write, gesture, point, and exemplify as well as speak\ndaos. On the other hand, not all speaking (writing etc.) is\ndao-ing\u2014particularly not if we think of language as\ndescribing, representing, picturing, expressing, defining, or\n\u201ccapturing\u201d some reality. The Chinese verbal use, is more\naccurately translated normatively as \u201cto guide\u201d, \u201cto\nrecommend, advocate, acknowledge, endorse\u201d, etc. The activity of\ndao-ing is primarily normative: giving guidance. To\ndao is to put guidance into language\u2014including body\nlanguage (e.g. pointing as meaning something in our \u201cform of\nlife.\u201d) \n\nConsider, again, the concrete translation for dao:\n\u2018road\u2019 or \u2018path\u2019. A woodsman with an ax\ndaos when he chops bark from the trees as he enters the\nforest; He is dao-ing when \u201cblazing\u201d the trail.\nWe grasp this concept best if we resist treating roads as simple\nnatural objects\u2014they are, like the woodman\u2019s blazes, akin to\ntexts that we \u201cread\u201d for guidance as we proceed that\nway. Roads or paths are embodied in a physical\nreality, but are not simply the reality. They are objectively real\nnormative structures that guide or invite us to \u201cpass this\nway\u201d. \n\nOne feature that dao and speech share is the need for\ninterpretation. But with dao the interpretation takes the\nform of xingwalk:conduct,\nnot that of a theory or a belief. In this respect, the relevant notion\nof interpretation is aesthetic. It is the kind of interpretation done\nwhen a conductor interprets a score, an actor a character in a play, a\nsoldier his orders in the course of battle. A complete metaphysics of\ndao requires a distinction between normative way\ntypes and interpretive, real-time tokens . Daoist\ntheory does introduces the tokens most dramatically with Shen Dao who\nfocuses on what he calls Great Dao\u2014the actual history of the\nworld past, present and future. That image draws our attention to a\npurely descriptive way\u2014a way that is not a (normative) way (not\na guide). \n\nTo talk, however, about a way of interpreting a way, is to remind\nourselves of Zhuangzi\u2019s point. That we can never free normative ways\nfrom ways of choosing and interpreting them. In selecting it from the\nalternative \u201cinvitations\u201d open to us, and then in\ninterpreting in our actual \u201cwalking\u201d we always rely on\nsome higher-order dao to justify our choice and execution of\nit. We are in a sea of dao. \n\nBesides the Great Dao (the actual history of the universe),\nwe can speak of tiannature:sky\ndaos, which are\nalso descriptive. Daos that advise us to accept or live by\nour nature, in effect, choose among equally natural daos.\nSince we have natural ways to reform or compensate for our natures.\nAny dao we can choose or interpret is natural in the sense\nthat it has for us at the time some physical realization\u2014sound\nwaves or pixels on a computer screen. All daos available for\nchoice or recommendation are natural. If determinism is true, the\nGreat Dao is the only tiannature:sky\ndao and every available\ndao for normative choice is a proper part of Great Dao. \n9.1.2 De (Virtuosity, Virtue, Power) \u5fb7\n\nA Daoist formula for de is \u201cdao within.\u201d\nIt may be the result of innate skill or of careful cultivation and\ntraining. Translators most commonly use \u201cvirtue\u201d as a\ntranslation but hurry to remind us that it is \u2018virtue\u2019 in\nthe ancient Greek sense of an excellence. \u2018Power\u2019 is an\nalternative translation that reflects the link between de and\nsuccessful action or achievement for its possessor. Given our use of\nan aesthetic conception of interpretation of dao, we may\nthink of one\u2019s de as her \u2018virtuosity\u2019. Virtuosity\nexhibits itself in a performer by making his\n\u201cinterpretation\u201d of the thing performed (a ceremony, chant\nor ritual) work in the context. Thus de links dao\nwith correct performance. This elegantly blends in the perceived\novertones of \u201cpower\u201d in the form of the performer\u2019s\nability to respond to clues in the context that make the performance\n\u201cwork.\u201d The \u201cpowerful\u201d performance achieves\nthe dao\u2019s goal in real time.\n9.2 Ming (Name) \u540d\n\nThe character mingnames\nreally includes all words. Grammatically, Chinese common nouns share\nmore features with proper names and one-place predicates (transitive\nverbs and adjectives) than do familiar Indo-European nouns. Chinese\ncommon nouns lack case and gender markings and Chinese grammar\nrequires no grammatical noun-verb agreement. Like mass nouns, Chinese\ncommon nouns do not undergo pluralization and can stand alone as noun\nphrases. For related reasons, Chinese analysis postulated no\nsubstance-attribute structure to adjective-noun relations. So the\ntranslation \u2018name\u2019 is not inept nor is the ancient Chinese\ntheory assumption that all words name the part of reality which the\nword \u201cpicks out\u201d\u2014roughly \u201cnaming\u201d what\nwe think of as its denotation or scope. Thus \u2018white\u2019 is a\nname and \u2018horse\u2019 is a name. Each names a region\nor part of the world. \n\nThe most familiar statement of a widely shared implicit theory of\nnames in ancient China is expressed beautifully in the Daode\nJing. Call it the \u201ccontrast theory\u201d of names. It\ntreats all words (norms or values) as \u201ccoming with\u201d a\ncomplement, converse or opposite. To learn and understand a word is to\nknow what is and what is not picked out by it. In the Daode\nJing, the theory lends itself to a linguistic idealist\ninterpretation. Names literally \u201ccreate\u201d things. This line\nof interpretation informs the \u201cchaos\u201d interpretation of\nDaoist metaphysics in which reality is an undifferentiated stuff which\nhumans divide into \u201cthings\u201d by the use of\nmingnames. \n\nAn interesting near homonym is mingcommand-fate\nwhich was routinely used as a\nverbal form of mingnames.\nThe familiar practice is to translate it as either\n\u2018command\u2019 (reminding us of the Chinese view that the role\nof language and names is guiding and coordinating behavior) or as\n\u2018fate\u2019. Another meaning-related near homonym is\nmingdiscerning:clear.\n9.3 Chang (Constant, Eternal) \u5e38\n\nThere is less controversy about the meaning of\nchangconstant, but its uses\nand importance in Chinese thought are not well understood. We can\nbetter appreciate the uses of changconstant\nin ancient Chinese by analogy with\ncausal and reliability theories in epistemology and semantics. Hu Shih\nspeculated that in this use, changconstant\nresembled a pragmatic conception of\n\u2018true\u2019. He pointed to a related use in the Mozi\nwhich advocates that we should changconstant\nlanguage that promotes [good?]\nbehavior. This quasi-imperative use underlies its role in Daoist\nrelativistic and skeptical analysis. The Daode Jing has the\nmost famous example of its use in the parallel opening couplet where\nit modifies both dao and mingnames.\n\n\nMohist use of the concept is instructive.\nTiannature:sky is a\nparadigm of constancy. The Mohists alluded to its regularity and\nuniversality to contrast with the temporary and local authority of\nsocial conventions and guidance by authority. They cast their\ndisagreement with Confucians in terms of who offered a constant\ndao. This seems to bridge three measures of constancy. \n\nA constant dao should apply equally to people of all\ncultures, times, and levels of social development. \nA constant dao should be operationally\nunambiguous\u2014like measurements operations. Its interpretation\ninto action should not invite variability. \nA constant dao should be consistent with natural\ntendencies; it should reinforce and draws reinforcement from them\nrather than encounter resistance in practice. \n\n\nDaoists, as the Laozi famously puts it, suggest that any\ndao that can dao (guide or be used as a guide) will\nnot be a constant dao. It follows this claim with a parallel\nclaims about mingnames. Any\nname that can name is an inconstant name. This is arguably offered as\nthe explanation of the inconstancy of dao asserted in the earlier\nsentence. \n9.4 Wei & Wu-wei (Deeming Action & Non-deeming Action) \u7121\u70ba\n\nLaozi\u2019s famous slogan has puzzled interpreters for centuries and has\ngiven rise to numerous analyses. The first character is not the main\nproblem. Wu is simply \u201cdoes not exist.\u201d In this\nphrase, however, interpreters treat it as a negative prescription:\n\u201cavoid wei.\u201d The harder problem is to understand\nwei.\n\nIn modern Mandarin, the character has two different tones. The fourth\ntone reading is usually translated as \u201cfor the sake of.\u201d\nIn the second tone reading, the character would normally be translated\nas \u2018to act\u2019. Textbook interpretations say wei\nmeans \u2018purpose\u2019 as well as \u2018action\u2019, so the\nslogan means \u201cnon-purposive action.\u201d The second tone\nreading, however, has another important use. Some grammar textbooks\ncall it the putative sense\u2014\u201cto deem, regard or\ninterpret.\u201d Wei functions in this sense in Literary\nChinese belief ascriptions which focus on the predicate. So a belief\nthat S is P takes the de re form [believer] takes S to be\n(wei) P. Wei also figures in a related way in\nknowledge contexts with nominal predicates\u2014\u201cknow to deem\nas (wei) [noun].\u201d \n\nAncient Chinese has several meaning-related homonyms, including weiis-only,\nweito\nbe called, and weiartificial.\nThe latter adds a\n\u2018human\u2019 radical to weido:deem.\nTypical translations of this character\ninclude \u2018artificial\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019. The cluster\nof concepts correspond to the pivotal Daoist contrast between\ntian (nature) and ren (the human). Wei is\nsomething done by human conceptualizing rather than something\n\u201cnatural.\u201d If we include this content in our explanation\nof Laozi\u2019s use of wei, we can explain its role more fully\nthan does the theory on acts while lacking \u2018purpose\u2019 or\ndeliberation. Little in the Laozi (or earlier Chinese\nthought) suggests any development of a distinction between voluntary,\ndeliberate, or purposive action and its opposite. To act without\nwei is to remove the social, conceptual character from our\nbehavior and act on \u201cnatural\u201d instinct or intuition. This\nmakes the concept cohere nicely with Laozi\u2019s analysis of names and\nknowledge as forms of social control.\n\nAs we noted, the \u201cinner chapters\u201d of the Zhuangzi\nrarely mentions the slogan. However, its use in the \u201couter\nchapters\u201d invites us to construct a possible Zhuangzi version of\nthe slogan. One tempting view associates wu-wei with the\n\u201cinner chapter\u201d discussions of skillful behavior that\ndevelops into a kind of satisfying and tranquil state of harmony with\naction that we might describe as \u201csecond nature.\u201d In\neffect one acts while in an aesthetic or performative trance. The most\nfamous expression of this ideal comes in the paean to the butcher who\ncarved oxen with the grace of a dancer. Such behavior requires a focus\nand absorption that is incompatible with ordinary self-consciousness,\npurpose and rehearsal of instructions. Besides this loss of a sense of\nthe ego, the experience is credited with creating a unity between the\nactor and the external world, and with a sense of heightened awareness\nand tranquility that comes with the masterful practice of an acquired\nskill. We experience mastery as \u201cbecoming one with the\nactivity.\u201d In some sense, our weiing has become\n[second?] natural!\n\nThe wu-wei ideal also informs the Neo-Daoist slogan\n\u201cSage within; king without.\u201d It suggests (following\nZhuangzi) that Daoist wu-wei may be consistent with being a\ngood Confucian. Being a scholar-official is as much a skill as being a\nbutcher and one may practice it with the same attitude of inner\nemptiness. As long as one takes the \u201cright\u201d attitude, one\nmay pursue any activity consistent\nwith Daoism. Neo-Daoists conform to Confucian roles without regarding\nor interpreting them as ultimately right\u2014or as anything\nelse.\n\nWith the importation of Indo-European Buddhism from India,\nwu-wei started to be interpreted via the Western conceptual\napparatus contrasting desire or purpose and reason. This shaped the\nmodern Chinese interpretation and probably undermined the ideal. It\nbecame the target of attack among \u201cmodern\u201d Chinese who\nregarded Daoist \u201cnon-striving\u201d or\n\u201cpurposelessness\u201d as the source of Chinese passivity. The\nactivist 19th century reformer, Kang You-wei (Kang\nhave-wei) took the denial of the slogan as his scholarly\nname.\n9.5 Pusimplicity (Pre-linguistic Purity) \u6a38\n\nThe Daoist \u201cprimitivist\u201d ideal as expressed mainly in the\nLaozi. It metaphorically represents the result of forgetting\nmingnames and desires (See\n Wu-wei).\n Translations include simplicity, \u201craw\u201d wood, and D. C.\nLau\u2019s more elaborate \u201cuncarved block.\u201d The detailed\ntranslation more sensitively expresses Laozi\u2019s point in using the\nmetaphor in the context of a view of names as \u201ccutting\u201d\nthings into types and Laozi\u2019s distinctive theory that such socially\nconstructed distinctions (institutions) control us by controlling our\ndesires. When societies adopt names or terms, it does so in order to\ninstill and regulate desires for one of the pair created by the\nname-induced distinction. Thus Daoist forgetting requires forgetting\nnames and distinctions, but in doing so, frees itself from the\nsocially induced, unnatural desires that cause strife and unhappiness\nin society (e.g. status, rare objects, fame, authority). Hence:\n\u201cThe Nameless uncarved block thus amounts to freedom from\ndesire.\u201d (Daode Jing 37)\n10. Texts and Textual History\n\nQuestions of textual theory are the focus of the bulk of modern\nscholarship. They include these kinds of questions.\n\nExistence (did Laozi or Zhuangzi actually exist)\nAuthorship (did they write the texts attributed to them?) \nDating (when did they exist or write their texts?)\nRelations (did Laozi influence Zhuangzi?)\n\n\nTraditional \u201cfantastic\u201d textual stories dominated\nexplanations of religious Daoism. This effectively replaces\nphilosophical content with mythical narrative and claims of pedigree\nor status of the founder. This aversion to exposition is compounded\nwith the traditional view that Daoist philosophy defies rational\nclarification. This philosophical site, accordingly, will give only\nabbreviated attention to these textual theories. \n\nThe traditional story centers on Laozi and the Daode Jing. It\ncredits the text to Laozi who was stopped at the pass while attempting\nto leave China (to go to India and come to be known as Buddha). The\nkeeper of the pass required him to leave his dao behind so\nLaozi dashed off 5000-odd quick characters of poetry. Zhuangzi\ninherited the insights and developed the Daoist outlook in parable\nform. \n\nModern text detectives, Chinese and Western, have successfully cast\ndoubt on this traditional view. However, their alternative scenarios,\nwhile collectively more plausible than the traditional story, are\ndiverse enough to lead a skeptic to conclude that no one\nknows the correct textual theories\u2014even if some of them\nturn out to be true. The time is too remote and the evidence too\nscarce to warrant using \u201cknow\u201d of any detailed textual\ntheory.\n\nTextual theorists themselves tend more toward interpretive skepticism.\nThey argue that textual theory is prior to and more certain than\ninterpretation\u2014which they treat as subjective projection. They\nwould reject textual skepticism as defeatism and as self-defeating for\nan interpretive theorist. \n\nCurrent textual thinking tends toward the view that all the classical\nChinese texts were being continuously edited and maintained in textual\ncommunities over sometimes hundreds of years. This editing and\nemendation often reflected interaction with other text communities as\nthey worked out alternative answers to shared questions. Clearly such\nan accretion theory undermines the traditional goal of uncovering the\n\u201coriginal\u201d in the sense of the earliest version of the\ntext. Text selection for interpretive and theoretical purposes becomes\na more normative issue\u2014which text is best? \n\nTextual theory was further complicated when archeologists unearthed\nnew copies of the Daode Jing. The traditionally dominant text\nwas named after one of the earliest commentators\u2014the Wang Bi\nversion. Most translations deviated only slightly from that\ntraditional version prior to the first archeological discovery in\n1973. In that year, two versions of the Daode Jing were\nunearthed in a Mawang Dui tomb site. The discovery energized textual\ntheorists who reasoned that as the earliest physically extant text,\nthe Mawang Dui must be closer to the original should be treated as\nauthoritative. The discovery was quickly followed by a rash of new\ntranslations of the Dedao Jing (the two parts of the text\nwere reversed in the newly discovered manuscripts). \n\nThe argument for its authoritative status was weak. The enthusiasm\nrested on the traditional attachment to an \u201coriginal\u201d text\n(earlier in time). In fact, the discovery tended to confirm the\nevolutionary, multiple-editor view, while this enthusiasm treated\ntextual evolution as if it took place by successive operations on a\nsingle physical text item. Like physiological evolution, text\nevolution more probably operated on a population or\n\u201cstream\u201d of copies, abridgements and additions. \n\nWang Bi probably had access to a range of that population in selecting\nhis version. The archeological discovery was of a single\ninstance\u2014a branch of the stream. The historical circumstances of\nthe presumed time of burial further undermined the optimistic\nassumption that the Mawang Dui was the original. The tomb\u2019s date\nplaces the texts after a radical disruption of textual\nhusbandry\u2014in 200 BCE when the Qin \u201cburned books and buried\nscholars.\u201d \n\nThe Qin had set out to destroy traditional learning. The later Han\nostensibly cherished and tried to recover textual scholarship. In the\nsucceeding Han, text collection, veneration preservation (and copying)\nbecame the norm. The theory that the Mawang Dui was the authoritative\ntext assumes that the destructive political frenzy at the end of\nclassical period had not affected the integrity of transmission that\nproduced the Mawang Dui instances. Then it must insist that in the\nsucceeding period of textual veneration and\npreservation, radical changes were introduced into the entire\npopulation of copies and versions of the text so that all\nthose on which Wang Bi drew on after the Han were corrupted\u2014and\nin similar ways\u2014from the orthodox Mawang Dui version. \n\nThe opposite story is more probable\u2014the sample was a version\nwritten with punctuation and interpretive emendation for a member of\nthe superstitious ruling class. Taking it as representing of the whole\npopulation of texts at the time is an elementary sampling error. \n\nThe Mawang Dui fervor was further undermined in 1993 when another\ndiscovery of a still older pair of abridged texts (dating from before\n200 BCE) turned out to be more like the traditional text (the order of\nselection reflected the traditional daode arrangement). Even\nmore notably, it strongly confirmed the gradual accretion view of the\ntext suggesting that the Daode Jing was still in the process\nof being compiled at that late date. This locates the composition of\nthe Daode Jing and the Zhuangzi almost\nside-by-side.\n\nLaozi\u2019s existence is widely disputed partly because the traditional\nstory seems impossible for one person to satisfy. That only entails,\nhowever, that not all the things in the story are true of him, not\nthat he didn\u2019t exist. On the other hand, there is little positive\nevidence that he did and there are many alternative stories of how he\ncame to be regarded as the author of the Daode Jing. It is\ncommon for theorists to treat \u2018Laozi\u2019 as a definite\ndescription referring to \u201cwhoever wrote the Daode\nJing.\u2014\u201dMany thus regard the question of his existence\nas equivalent to the question of his authorship of at least a part of\nthe text\u2014hence improbable given current textual theory. The\nissues, however, are also separate. Laozi could have existed and not\nwritten any of the text attributed to him. On balance, the existence\nof Zhuangzi is considerably more probable, though little is known of\nhim that is not from the text bearing his name\u2014many of whose\nstories are obviously fanciful. \n\nIn China today, parts of the traditional theory have been resurrected.\nSome scholars are arguing for a pre-Confucius date for Laozi on\nvarious textual grounds (especially poetic structure). Traditional as\nwell as modern scholarship tends to attribute the first eight\n\u201cinner\u201d chapters to Zhuangzi and there has been little\ndoubt about his existence. So far, one important implication of modern\ntextual theory has had little effect on popular interpretations. If we\ninevitably rely on the stories in the Zhuangzi\u2014for\nour knowledge about him, then the known chief intellectual\ninfluence on Zhuangzi should be treated as the sophist and linguistic\ntheorist, Hui Shi, not Laozi or the Daode Jing.\n\nTextual theories of the Zhuangzi are more elaborate and\nconsistent. Though they differ in details and identification of parts,\ntext scholars largely converge on attributing the chapters, outside of\nthe eight assigned to Zhuangzi himself, to students of Zhuangzi, to\nprimitivists who are associated with Yang Zhu (Yangists), and to other\nmore eclectic and religious writers associated probably with the\nproduction of the other texts associated with Daoism. To be strict,\nhowever, despite the prevalence of the opinion, there is nothing\nresembling a convincing argument that Zhuangzi wrote all eight of the\nso called \u201cinner chapters.\u201d \n\nProbably the association of the Laozi and Zhuangzi texts began when\nstudents of Zhuangzi noticed some shared or reinforcing themes\nexpressed in a contemporary anonymous textual group working\non the evolving Daode Jing. Perhaps both groups appreciated\nthe affinity and began to exchange themes, expressions, and related\nlines of thought. Graham argued that the association of Laozi with the\nDaode Jing dates from a conspiratorial attempt to gain\nauthority over Confucianism by claiming that the Daode Jing\nstemmed from Confucius\u2019 teacher who was known in legend as Laozi.\n\nThis is a rough table of the state of textual theories of the two\ndefining texts of Daoism. There are four main questions; the table\nlists, for each question, the traditional story, the range of\ntheories, and the most plausible answer to the question.\n\nExistence\n\n\nTraditional story: Laozi and Zhuangzi like\nteacher-student or prophet-disciple.\nRange of theories: Zhuangzi inspired the\nformulation of the myth of Laozi and the attribution.\nMost plausible answer: Zhuangzi knew only the\nConfucian story of Laozi. Laozi\u2019s actual existence merely\npossible.\n \nAuthorship\n\n\nTraditional story: Laozi wrote the Daode\nJing before traveling to India to found Buddhism. Zhuangzi wrote\nthe Zhuangzi.\nRange of theories: Zhuangzi wrote only chapter\ntwo. Daode Jing a product of Huang-Lao ruler-mysticism.\nMost plausible answer: Both books the product of\ntextual communities who continually edit and add to the text. Zhuangzi\nwrote at most eight chapters.\n \nDating\n\n\nTraditional story: The Daode Jing was\nwritten before Confucius. Zhuangzi inspired to expand on its mystical\ninsight.\nRange of theories: Daode Jing being\nedited well into the Han dynasty. Miscellaneous and Outer chapters of\nthe Zhuangzi edited or composed into the Han.\nMost plausible answer: Both being edited through\nand beyond the classical period.\n \nRelation\n\n\nTraditional story: Laozi prophet/teacher,\nZhuangzi disciple/pupil.\nRange of theories: Zhuangzi formulated his\ntheories first and the chief influence was his sophist friend Hui\nShi.\nMost plausible answer: Textual communities began\nto borrow from each other after the inner chapters completed.\n \n\n\nOther textual theories address the authorship, dating and relations to\nthe two canonical Daoist texts to the later \u201creligious\u201d\ntexts mentioned above. Essentially the upshot is that they borrowed\nheavily from the two classical texts, often changing the context and\nfailing to understand the philosophical point. The quotations they\nused were embedded in popular cosmological and religious contexts.\n",
