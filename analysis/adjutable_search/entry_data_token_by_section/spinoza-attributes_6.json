    "main_text": "Attributes in the Ethics || The 2P7 Doctrine\n1.6 The 2P7 Doctrine\n\nA very important characteristic regarding attributes is established in\n2P7 and its scholium, which is sometimes referred to in the literature\nas the \u201cparallelism doctrine.\u201d However, as will be\ndiscussed in Section 1.9.2, this nomenclature is laden with a\nsignificant amount of interpretative bias and the term is nowhere to\nbe found in the Ethics itself. It is thus advisable to stay\nclear of it and simply refer to it as \u201cthe 2P7 Doctrine.\u201d\n2P7 states: \u201cThe order and connection of ideas is the same as\nthe order and connection of things,\u201d (\u201cordo, &\nconnexio idearum idem est, ac ordo & connexio rerum\u201d).\nSpinoza explains this proposition in the scholium:\n\nFor example, a circle existing in Nature and the idea of the existing\ncircle, which is also in God, are one and the same thing, which is\nexplained through different attributes\u2026Therefore, whether we\nconceive Nature under the attribute of extension, or under the\nattribute of thought, or under any attribute, we shall find one and\nthe same order, or one and the same connection of causes, that is,\nthat the same things follow one another.\n\n\nSpinoza is claiming here that a mode X under the attribute of\nThought is one and the same as mode X under\nAttributey. A good way to get some intuitive sense\nof this is to see how this works with respect to ourselves. Under the\nattribute of Thought, I am a finite mode\u2014an idea or mind. Under\nthe attribute of Extension, I am a finite mode, that is, a body. The\nclaim in 2P7 and its scholium is that my mind (a mode of Thought) and\nmy body (a mode of Extension) are one and the same. This is the case\nfor all modes. Furthermore, whatever causal relation my body, say,\nbears to other modes of Extension, my mind will bear to the other\nmodes of Thought. The understanding of this doctrine and its\nimplications in more depth depends, probably more than any other\ndoctrine, on how one construes other central elements of\nSpinoza\u2019s theory of attributes (e.g. the number of attributes).\nIn Section 1.9.2 different directions of interpretation are considered\nregarding 2P7 and its scholium.\n",
