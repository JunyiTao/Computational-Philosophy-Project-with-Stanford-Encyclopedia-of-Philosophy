    "main_text": "Moral Disagreement and the Semantics (and Metasemantics) of Moral Language || Further Developments and Responses\n5.3 Further Developments and Responses\n\n\nThe Moral Twin Earth thought experiment has led philosophers to\nexplore other metasemantical options, besides Boyd\u2019s causal\ntheory, which realists may use to argue that they can accommodate the\npertinent intuitions about when people are in a genuine moral\ndisagreement. These options include conceptual role semantics (Wedgwood\n2001) and David Lewis\u2019 views on \u201creference magnetism\u201d\n(van Roojen 2006; Dunaway and McPherson 2016; Williams 2016; see Eklund\n2017 for further discussion). The general problem that those\nalternative suggestions are intended to solve can be indicated as\nfollows. Horgan\u2019s and Timmons\u2019 argument suggests that the\nfact that a speaker\u2019s use of \u201cright\u201d is regulated by\na certain property is of limited relevance to the plausibility of\nviewing us as being in a genuine disagreement when discussing its\napplication. What matters are instead the considerations pertaining to\nthe social and psychological roles the term plays in the\nspeaker\u2019s community and in his or her deliberations. To\naccommodate the intuitions the moral twin earth thought experiment\nevokes (and to handle new scenarios that antirealists might come up\nwith), what realists seem to need is thus an account to the effect that\nthose very considerations are enough to secure co-reference. That is,\nthe account must entail that the features that tempt us to interpret\nthe speaker as being in a genuine moral disagreement with us are the\nsame as, or at least reliably correlated with, the features on which\nco-reference is taken to supervene.\n\n\nThe difficulties of developing an account which fits that bill are\nelevated by the fact that there are further requirements it arguably\nmust meet. One such additional requirement is that the account must be\nplausibly applicable also to other domains besides morality (see\nSchroeter and Schroeter 2013 and Dunaway and McPherson 2016 for\ndiscussions of the relevant constraints). To design an account of\nreference which entails that there is co-reference in exactly the cases\nwhere we intuitively think that people disagree in scenarios such as\nthe Moral Twin Earth one may not be such a difficult task. But the idea\nbehind the additional requirement is that this would be ad hoc\nif the account were only applicable to moral terms (or to normative\nterms in general). Note in this context that Boyd takes his account to\napply not only to moral terms but to natural kind terms quite generally\n(which is the type he thinks that \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cright\u201d are instances of), including \u201cwater\u201d\nand \u201cgold\u201d. If one were to drop that \u201cgenerality\nconstraint\u201d, allowing for a metasemantic view that applies just\nto moral or other normative terms, then the task for the realist would\nbe simpler.\n\n\nIs there a way to justify such a move? In this connection, one might\nwonder if it would help the moral realist to be a non-naturalist about\nthe nature of moral properties, i.e., to hold that they are not\nreducible to natural properties and (on some characterizations of the\ntheory) to assume that they are sui generis and causally\ninert. That is an issue which has not been in the foreground in the\ndebate following the Horgan\u2019s and Timmons\u2019 contributions,\nas they specifically target Boyd\u2019s (and Brink\u2019s) naturalist\nform of realism.\n\n\nWhether non-naturalism really is less vulnerable to the challenge is\nnot clear, however. On the one hand, the assumption that moral\nproperties are sui generis may help realists to defend the\nexceptionalist view that the reference of moral terms is determined in\na special way (at least along with terms in other domains that deal\nwith non-natural properties). On the other hand, explaining how our\nmoral terms have come to refer to such properties may be extra\ndifficult, especially given the further assumption that they are\ncausally inert (the issue is discussed in Suikkanen 2017). It should\nalso be noted that the soundness of at least the charity-based versions\nof the challenge seems unaffected by what view one takes on the nature\nof moral properties. On those versions, systematic differences\nregarding the application of moral terms threaten to undermine\nco-reference regardless of whether the candidate properties to which\nthose terms refer are taken to be non-natural or not.\n\n\nThe responses that so far have been discussed are aimed to show that\nrealists are not in fact committed to the allegedly implausible\nimplications (viz., that certain moral disputes are merely apparent) to\nwhich antirealists seek to tie them. Another type of response is to\nbite the bullet, to insist that the pertinent implications are after\nall acceptable, and to explain away their counter-intuitiveness in a\nway which is consistent with realism.\n\n\nOn one such suggestion, the parties of some disputes about how to\napply \u201cright\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d do indeed use the terms\nto refer to different properties. But what they really disagree about\nis which property the terms should be used to refer to, in\nsome non-moral sense of \u201cshould\u201d (see, e.g., Merli 2002 and\nPlunkett and Sundell 2013). Presumably, however, this suggestion helps\nthe realist only if that other, background dispute can in turn be\nconstrued as a conflict of belief. So, if the challenge could be\nextended to cover the \u201cshould\u201d which is relevant in that\ncontext as well, which it seems hard to rule out, nothing much is\naccomplished (see Tersman 2006, 100 and Dunaway and McPherson 2016,\n661, for this point).\n\n\nA different option is to concede that the appearance in the relevant\ncases of a genuine dispute is best explained in terms of clashes of\nconative attitudes, and to stress that this explanation is not\nincompatible with realism. After all, realists can consistently agree\nthat moral convictions are usually accompanied with such attitudes (see\nJackson and Pettit 1998 for this point). By making that response,\nrealists in effect give up trying to account for the cases by using\nassumptions that form a part of their theory. For even if the\nassumption that the cases involve clashing attitudes is not\ninconsistent with realism it is also not entailed by it. A potential\nproblem with that type of response is raised by the natural view that\nthe justification of a theory about moral semantics (such as the form\nof cognitivism which forms a component of realism) depends at least in\npart on its ability to explain how people behave or relate to disputes\nabout how to apply moral terms. The relevant facts include the\nwillingness of such disputants to see themselves as standing in genuine\nopposition to each other. Thus, if, in some cases, that fact is best\nexplained by assumptions that are external to that theory, then some\nbits of the relevant evidence fail to support it. That is a potential\ndisadvantage of the pertinent response, although there may obviously be\nother sets of evidence which make up for the (alleged) loss (see\nfurther Tersman 2006, ch. 5 and Bj\u00f6rnsson 2012).\n",
