Introduction\n\nDutch artist M.C. Escher\u2019s elegant pictorial paradoxes are\nprized by many, not least by philosophers, physicists, and\nmathematicians. Some of his work, for example Ascending and\nDescending, relies on optical illusion to depict what is actually\nan impossible situation. Other works are paradoxical in the broad\nsense, but not impossible: Relativity depicts a\ncoherent arrangement of objects, albeit an arrangement in which the\nforce of gravity operates in an unfamiliar fashion. (See the\n Other Internet Resources\n section below for images.) Quantum gravity itself may be like this:\nan unfamiliar yet coherent arrangement of familiar elements. Or it may\nbe more like Ascending and Descending, an impossible\nconstruction which looks sensible in its local details but does not\nfit together into a coherent whole when using presently existing\nbuilding materials. If the latter is true, then the construction of a\nquantum theory of gravity may demand entirely unfamiliar elements.\nWhatever the final outcome, the situation at present is one of flux,\nwith a great many competing approaches vying for the prize. However,\nit is also important to note that the prize is not always the same:\nstring theorists seek a unified theory of all four interactions that\nhas the power of explaining such things as the numbers of generations\nof elementary particles and other previous inexplicable properties.\nOther approaches are more modest, and seek only to bring general\nrelativity in line with quantum theory, without necessarily invoking\nthe other interactions. Hence, the problem of quantum gravity\ncan mean very different things to different researchers and what\nconstitutes a possible solution to one group might not qualify as such\nto another.\n\nGiven that quantum gravity does not yet exist as a working physical\ntheory, one might legitimately question whether philosophers have any\nbusiness being involved at this stage. Certainly the\nphilosopher\u2019s task will be somewhat different from that faced\nwhen dealing with a more-or-less settled body of theory such as\nclassical Newtonian mechanics, general relativity, or quantum\nmechanics. In such cases, one typically proceeds by assuming the\nphysical soundness of the theory or theoretical framework and drawing\nout the ontological and perhaps epistemological consequences of the\ntheory, trying to understand what it is that the theory is telling us\nabout the nature of space, time, matter, causation, and so on.\nTheories of quantum gravity, on the other hand, are bedeviled by a\nhost of technical and conceptual problems, questions, and issues that\nmake them largely unsuited to this kind of interpretive approach. In\nthe case of string theory, there isn\u2019t even really a\n\u2018theory\u2019 to speak of, so much as several clues pointing to\nwhat many hope will some day be an applicable, consistent physical\ntheory. However, philosophers who have a taste for a broader and more\nopen-ended form of inquiry will find much to think about, and it is\nentirely possible that future philosophers of physics will be faced\nwith problems of a very different flavour as a result of the peculiar\nnature of quantum gravity. Indeed, Tian Cao argues that quantum\ngravity offers up a unique opportunity for philosophers of\nphysics, leaving them \u201cwith a good chance to make some positive\ncontributions, rather than just analysing philosophically what\nphysicists have already established\u201d (Cao, 2001, p. 138). This\nsentiment has in fact been echoed by several physicists, not least by\nCarlo Rovelli (a central architect of the approach known as loop\nquantum gravity), who complains that he wishes philosophers would not\nrestrict themselves to \u201ccommenting and polishing the present\nfragmentary physical theories, but would take the risk of trying to\nlook ahead\u201d (Rovelli, 1997, p. 182). This raises an\nimportant point: though we think of general relativity and quantum\ntheory as \u2018nice\u2019 theories from the point of view of\nphilosophical investigation, in a very real sense they are not the\nwhole story and break down at extreme scales. \n2. Gravity Meets Quantum Theory\n\nThe difficulties in reconciling quantum theory and gravity into some\nform of quantum gravity come from the prima facie\nincompatibility of general relativity, Einstein\u2019s relativistic\ntheory of gravitation, and quantum field theory, the framework for the\ndescription of the other three forces (electromagnetism and the strong\nand weak nuclear interactions). Whence the incompatibility? General\nrelativity is described by Einstein\u2019s equations, which amount to\nconstraints on the curvature of spacetime (the Einstein tensor on the\nleft-hand side) due to the presence of mass and other forms of energy,\nsuch as electromagnetic radiation (the stress-energy-momentum tensor\non the right-hand side). (See John Baez\u2019s webpages in\n Other Internet Resources\n for an excellent introduction.) In doing so, they manage to encompass\ntraditional, Newtonian gravitational phenomena such as the mutual\nattraction of two or more massive objects, while also predicting new\nphenomena such as the bending and red-shifting of light by these\nobjects (which have been observed) and the existence of gravitational\nradiation (until very recently, with the direct detection of\ngravitational waves by LIGO, this was, of course, only indirectly\nobserved via the decrease in the period of binary pulsars-see the\n 1993 Physics Nobel Prize presentation speech by Carl Nordling.)\n\nIn general relativity, mass and energy are treated in a purely\nclassical manner, where \u2018classical\u2019 means that physical\nquantities such as the strengths and directions of various fields and\nthe positions and velocities of particles have definite values. These\nquantities are represented by tensor fields, sets of (real) numbers\nassociated with each spacetime point. For example, the stress, energy,\nand momentum\nTab(x,t) of the\nelectromagnetic field at some point\n(x,t), are functions of the three\ncomponents Ei, Ej,\nEk, Bi,\nBj, Bk of the electric and\nmagnetic fields E and\nB at that point. These quantities in turn\ndetermine, via Einstein\u2019s equations, an aspect of the\n\u2018curvature\u2019 of spacetime, a set of numbers\nGab(x,t) which\nis in turn a function of the spacetime metric. The metric\ngab(x,t) is a\nset of numbers associated with each point which gives the distance to\nneighboring points. A model of the world according to general\nrelativity consists of a spacetime manifold with a metric, the\ncurvature of which is constrained by the stress-energy-momentum of the\nmatter distribution. All physical quantities \u2014 the value of the\nx-component of the electric field at some point, the scalar\ncurvature of spacetime at some point, and so on \u2014 have definite\nvalues, given by real (as opposed to complex or imaginary) numbers.\nThus general relativity is a classical theory in the sense given\nabove.\n\nThe problem is that our fundamental theories of matter and energy, the\ntheories describing the interactions of various particles via the\nelectromagnetic force and the strong and weak nuclear forces, are all\nquantum theories. In\n quantum theories,\n these physical quantities do not in general have definite\nvalues. For example, in quantum mechanics, the position of an electron\nmay be specified with arbitrarily high accuracy only at the cost of a\nloss of specificity in the description of its momentum, hence its\nvelocity. At the same time, in the quantum theory of the\nelectromagnetic field known as quantum electrodynamics (QED), the\nelectric and magnetic fields associated with the electron suffer an\nassociated uncertainty. In general, physical quantities are described\nby a quantum state which gives a probability distribution over many\ndifferent values, and increased specificity (narrowing of the\ndistribution) of one property (e.g., position, electric field) gives\nrise to decreased specificity of its canonically conjugate property\n(e.g., momentum, magnetic field). This is an expression of\nHeisenberg\u2019s\n Uncertainty Principle.\n In the context of quantum gravity the fluctuating geometry is known\nas \u201cspacetime foam\u201d. Likewise, if one focusses in on the\nspatial geometry, it will not have a definite trajectory.\n\nOn the surface, the incompatibility between general relativity and\nquantum theory might seem rather trivial. Why not just follow the\nmodel of QED and quantize the gravitational field, similar to the way\nin which the electromagnetic field was quantized? This is more or less\nthe path that was taken, but it encounters extraordinary difficulties.\nSome physicists consider these to be \u2018merely\u2019 technical\ndifficulties, having to do with the non-renormalizability of the\ngravitational interaction and the consequent failure of the\nperturbative methods which have proven effective in ordinary quantum\nfield theories. However, these technical problems are closely related\nto a set of daunting conceptual difficulties, of interest to\nboth physicists and philosophers.\n\nThe conceptual difficulties basically follow from the nature of the\ngravitational interaction, in particular the equivalence of\ngravitational and inertial mass, which allows one to represent gravity\nas a property of spacetime itself, rather than as a field propagating\nin a (passive) spacetime background. When one attempts to\nquantize gravity, one is subjecting some of the properties of\nspacetime to quantum fluctuations. For example, in canonical\nquantizations of gravity one isolates and then quantizes geometrical\nquantities (roughly the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature of three\ndimensional space) functioning as the position and momentum variables.\nGiven the uncertainty principle and the probabilistic nature of\nquantum theory, one has a picture involving fluctuations of the\ngeometry of space, much as the electric and magnetic fields fluctuate\nin QED. But ordinary quantum theory presupposes a well-defined\nclassical background against which to define these\nfluctuations (Weinstein, 2001a, b), and so one runs into trouble not\nonly in giving a mathematical characterization of the quantization\nprocedure (how to take into account these fluctuations in the\neffective spacetime structure?) but also in giving a conceptual and\nphysical account of the theory that results, should one succeed. For\nexample, a fluctuating metric would seem to imply a fluctuating causal\nstructure and spatiotemporal ordering of events, in which case, how is\none to define equal-time commutation relations in the quantum theory?\n(See the section on the Lagrangian formulation in the entry on\n quantum field theory.)\n \n\nCao (2001) believes that the conceptual nature of the problem demands\na conceptual resolution. He advocates what he calls \u2018ontological\nsynthesis\u2019. This approach asks for an analysis of the\nontological pictures of the two ingredient theories of quantum\ngravity, so that their consistency (the consistency of the resulting\nsynthesis) can be properly assessed. Ontology for Cao refers to the\nprimary, autonomous structures from which all other properties and\nrelations in a theory are constructed. A fairly simple inspection of\nthe respective ontological constraints imposed by general relativity\nand quantum field theory reveals serious tension: general relativity\ndiscards the fixed kinematical structure of spacetime, so that\nlocalization is rendered relational, but in quantum field theory a\nfixed flat background is part of its ontological basis, from which the\nstandard features of the theory are derived. On the other hand, as we\nhave seen, quantum field theory involves quantum fluctuations in the\nvicinity of a point, while general relativity involves the use of a\nsmooth point neighbourhood. Either way, in order to bring the two\nontological bases together, some piece of either edifice must be\ndemolished. Cao proposes that the tension can best be resolved by\nfocussing firmly on those sine qua non principles of the\nrespective theories. Cao views the gravitational property of universal\ncoupling as essential, but notes that this does not require\ncontinuity, so that the former could be retained while discarding the\nlatter, without rendering the framework inconsistent, thus allowing\nfor quantum theory\u2019s violent fluctuations (Cao\u2019s prime\ncandidate for an essential quantum field theoretic concept). Likewise,\nhe argues that quantum field theory requires a fixed background in\norder to localize quantum fields and set up causal structure. But he\nnotes that a relational account of localization could perform such a\nfunction, with fields localized relative to each other. In so doing,\none could envisage a diffeomorphism covariant quantum field theory\n(i.e. one that does not involve reference to fields localized at\npoints of the spacetime manifold). The resulting synthesized entity (a\nviolently fluctuating, universally coupled quantum gravitational\nfield) would then be what a quantum theory of gravity ought to\ndescribe.\n\nWhile such an approach sounds sensible enough on the surface, to\nactually put it into practice in the constructive stages of\ntheory-building (rather than a retrospective analysis of a completed\ntheory) is not going to be easy\u2014though it has to be said, the\nmethod Cao describes bears close resemblance to the way loop quantum\ngravity has developed. Lucien Hardy (2007) has developed a novel\napproach to quantum gravity that shares features of Cao\u2019s\nsuggestion, though the principles isolated are different from\nCao\u2019s. The causaloid approach is intended to provide a\nframework for quantum gravity theories, where idea is to\ndevelop a general formalism that respects the key features of both\ngeneral relativity, which he takes to be the dynamical\n(non-probabilistic) causal structure, and quantum theory, which he\ntakes to be the probabilistic (nondynamical) dynamics. The causaloid\n(of some theory) is an entity that encodes all that can be calculated\nin the theory. Part of the problem here is that Cao\u2019s (and\nHardy\u2019s) approach assumes that the ontological principles hold\nat the Planck scale. However, it is perfectly possible that both of\nthe input theories break down at higher energies. Not only that, the\ntechnical difficulties of setting up the kind of (physically\nrealistic) diffeomorphism-invariant quantum field theory he suggests\nhave so far proven to be an insurmountable challenge. One crucial\naspect that is missing from Cao\u2019s framework is a notion of what\nthe observables might be. Of course, they must be relational,\nbut this still leaves the problem very much open. (The idea of making\nprogress by isolating appropriate principles of quantum gravity\nforms the basis of a special issue: Crowther and Rickles, eds,\n2014.)\n\nWe will look in more detail at how various conceptual and\nmethodological problems arise in two different research programs\nbelow. But first, we introduce some key features of the leading\nresearch programs.\n3. Theoretical Frameworks\n\nAll approaches to the problem of quantum gravity agree that something\nmust be said about the relationship between gravitation and quantized\nmatter. These various approaches can be catalogued in various ways,\ndepending on the relative weight assigned to general relativity and\nquantum field theory. Some approaches view general relativity as in\nneed of correction and quantum field theory as generally applicable,\nwhile others view quantum field theory as problematic and general\nrelativity as having a more universal status. Still others view the\ntheories in a more even-handed manner, perhaps with both simply\namounting to distinct limits of a deeper theory. It has often been\nsuggested, since the earliest days of quantum gravity research, that\nbringing quantum field theory and general relativity together might\nserve to cure their respective singularity problems (the former\nresulting from bad high frequency behaviour of fields; the latter\nresulting from certain kinds of gravitational collapse). This hope\ndoes seem to have been borne out in many of the current approaches.\nRoger Penrose has even argued that the joint consideration of\ngravitation and quantum theory could resolve the infamous quantum\nmeasurement problem (see Penrose 2001; see also the section on the\nmeasurement problem in the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory).\n The basic idea of Penrose\u2019s proposal is fairly simple to grasp:\nwhen there is wave-packet spreading of the centre of mass of some\nbody, there results a greater imprecision in the spacetime structure\nassociated with the spreading wave-packet, and this destroys the\ncoherence of the distant parts of the wave-function. There are\ndifficulties in distinguishing the gravitationally induced collapse\nthat Penrose proposes from the effective collapse induced by quantum\ntheory itself, thanks to decoherence\u2014Joy Christian (2005) has\nsuggested that by observing oscillations in the flavor ratios of\nneutrinos originating at cosmological distances one could eliminate\nthe confounding effects of environmental decoherence.\n\nBy far the two most popular approaches are string theory and loop\nquantum gravity. The former is an example of an approach to quantum\ngravity in which the gravitational field is not quantized; rather, a\ndistinct theory is quantized which happens to coincide with general\nrelativity at low energies. The latter is an approach involving\n(constrained) canonical quantization, albeit of a version of general\nrelativity based on a different choice of variables than the usual\ngeometrodynamical, metric-based variables. We cover the basic details\nof each of these in the following subsections.\n3.1 String Theory\n\nKnown variously as string theory, superstring theory, and M-theory,\nthis program (qua theory of quantum gravity) has its roots,\nindirectly, in the observation, dating back to at least the 1930s,\nthat classical general relativity looks in many ways like the theory\nof a massless \u2018spin-two\u2019 field propagating on the flat\nMinkowski spacetime of special relativity. [See Cappelli et\nal. (eds.) 2012, and Gasperini and Maharana (eds.) 2008, for\ncollections of essays covering the early history of string theory;\nRickles 2014 offers a conceptually-oriented history of the earlier\ndays of string theory; Rovelli 2001b (Other Internet Resources section\nbelow) and 2006 offer a capsule history, and Greene 2000 provides a\npopular account.] This observation led to early attempts to formulate\na quantum theory of gravity by \u201cquantizing\u201d this spin-two\ntheory. However, it turned out that the theory is not perturbatively\nrenormalizable, meaning that there are ineliminable infinities.\nAttempts to modify the classical theory to eliminate this problem led\nto a different problem, non-unitarity, and so this general approach\nwas moribund until the mid-1970s, when it was discovered that a theory\nof one-dimensional \u201cstrings\u201d developed around 1970 to\naccount for the strong interaction, actually provided a framework for\na unified theory which included gravity, because one of the modes of\noscillation of the string corresponded to a massless spin-two particle\n(the \u2018graviton\u2019).\n\nThe original and still prominent idea behind string theory was to\nreplace the point particles of ordinary quantum field theory\n(particles like photons, electrons, etc) with one-dimensional extended\nobjects called strings. (See Weingard, 2001 and Witten, 2001 for\noverviews of the conceptual framework.) In the early development of\nthe theory, it was recognized that construction of a consistent\nquantum theory of strings required that the strings \u201clive\u201d\nin a larger number of spatial dimensions than the observed three.\nString theories containing fermions as well as bosons must be\nformulated in nine space dimensions and one time dimension. Strings\ncan be open or closed, and have a characteristic tension and hence\nvibrational spectrum. The various modes of vibration correspond to\nvarious particles, one of which is the graviton (the hypothetical\nmassless, spin-2 particle responsible for mediating gravitational\ninteractions). The resulting theories have the advantage of being\nperturbatively renormalizable. This means that perturbative\ncalculations are at least mathematically tractable. Since perturbation\ntheory is an almost indispensable tool for physicists, this is deemed\na good thing.\n\nString theory has undergone several mini-revolutions over the last\nseveral years, one of which involved the discovery of various duality\nrelations, mathematical transformations connecting, in this case, what\nappear to be physically distinct string theories \u2014 type I, type\nIIA, type IIB, (heterotic) SO(32) and (heterotic)\nE8\u00d7E8 \u2014 to one another and to\neleven-dimensional supergravity (a particle theory). The discovery of\nthese connections led to the conjecture that all of the string\ntheories are really aspects of a single underlying theory, which was\ngiven the name \u2018M-theory\u2019 (though M-theory is also used\nmore specifically to describe the unknown theory of which\neleven-dimensional supergravity is the low energy limit). The\nrationale, according to one kind of duality (S-duality), is that one\ntheory at strong coupling (high energy description) is physically\nequivalent (in terms of physical symmetries, correlation functions and\nall observable content) to another theory at weak coupling (where a\nlower energy means a more tractable description), and that if all the\ntheories are related to one another by dualities such as this, then\nthey must all be aspects of some more fundamental theory. Though\nattempts have been made, there has been no successful formulation of\nthis theory: its very existence, much less its nature, is still\nlargely a matter of conjecture.\n\nThere has been some recent interest in dualities by philosophers,\ngiven their clear links to standard philosophical issues such as\nunderdetermination, conventionalism, and emergence/reduction. The link\ncomes about because in a dual pair (of theories) one has a observable\nequivalence combined with what appears to be radical physical (and\nmathematical) differences. These differences can be as extreme as\ndescribing spacetimes of apparently different topological structures,\nincluding different numbers of dimensions. This has led some\nphysicists to speak of spacetime emerging, depending on such\nthings as the coupling strength governing physical interactions. This\ncan be seen most clearly in the context of the AdS/CFT duality in\nwhich a ten dimensional string theory is found to be observationally\nequivalent (again covering physical symmetries, observables and their\ncorrelation functions) to a four dimensional gauge theory \u2014 this\nis sometimes called a \u2018gauge/gravity\u2019 duality since the\nstring theory contains gravity (all string theories contain\ngravitons) while the gauge theory does not. Since there is an\nequivalence between these descriptions, it makes sense to say that\nneither is fundamental, and so (elements of) the spacetimes they\napparently describe are also not fundamental; thus implying that the\nspacetime we observe at low-energies is an emergent phenomenon \u2014\nVistarini 2013 is a recent discussion of spacetime emergence in string\ntheory. One way to view such dual pairs is in terms of the two\ntheories (the gauge theory and a gravitational theory) being distinct\nclassical limits of a more all-encompassing quantum theory. In this\ncase, the classical emergent structures also include the specific\ngauge symmetries and degrees of freedom of the limiting theories. A\nproblem remains of making sense of the more fundamental theory (and\nthe associated physical structure it describes) from which these\nspacetimes and gauge symmetries emerge. \n\nPhilosophically speaking, there is a large question mark over whether\nthe dual pair should be seen as genuinely distinct in a physical sense\nor as mere notational variants of the same theory \u2014 talk of a\n\u201cdictionary\u201d relating the theories makes the latter more\npalatable and suggests that the choice of physical interpretation\nmight be conventional. However, if we view the theories as notational\nvariants, then our sense of theory-individuation is seemingly\ncompromised, since the dual pairs involve different dynamics and\ndegrees of freedom. (See Joseph Polchinski 2014, for a thorough\naccount of the various kinds of dualities along with some of their\ninterpretive quirks; Rickles 2011 provides a philosophical examination\nof string dualities.) \n3.2 Canonical and Loop Quantum Gravity\n\nWhereas (perturbative) string theory and other so-called\n\u2018covariant\u2019 approaches view the curved spacetime of\ngeneral relativity as an effective modification of a flat (or other\nfixed) background geometry by a massless spin-two field, the canonical\nquantum gravity program treats the full spacetime metric itself as a\nkind of field, and attempts to quantize it directly without splitting\nit apart into a flat part and a perturbation. However, spacetime\nitself is split apart into a stack of three dimensional slices (a\nfoliation) on which is defined a spatial geometry. Technically, work\nin this camp proceeds by writing down general relativity in so-called\n\u2018canonical\u2019 or \u2018Hamiltonian\u2019 form, since there\nis a more-or-less clearcut way to quantize theories once they are put\nin this form (Kuchar, 1993; Belot & Earman, 2001). In a canonical\ndescription, one chooses a particular set of configuration variables\nxi and canonically conjugate momentum variables\npi which describe the state of a system at some\ntime, and can be encoded in a phase space. Then, one obtains the\ntime-evolution of these variables from the Hamiltonian\nH(xi,pi), which\nprovides the physically possible motions in the phase space a family\nof curves. Quantization proceeds by treating the configuration and\nmomentum variables as operators on a quantum state space (a Hilbert\nspace) obeying certain commutation relations analogous to the\nclassical Poisson-bracket relations, which effectively encode the\nquantum fuzziness associated with Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty\nprinciple. The Hamiltonian operator, acting on quantum states, would\nthen generate the dynamical evolution.\n\nWhen one attempts to write general relativity down in this way, one\nhas to contend with the existence of constraints on the\ncanonical variables that are inherited from the diffeomorphism\ninvariance of the spacetime formulation of the theory. The single\ntensorial equation that we see in standard presentations of the\nEinstein field equations is translated into 10 scalar equations in the\ncanonical formulation, with constraints accounting for four of these\nequations (the remaining six are genuine evolutionary equations).\nThree of the constraints (known as the momentum or diffeomorphism\nconstraints) are responsible for shifting data tangential to the\ninitial surface and, thus, are related to the shift vector field. The\nremaining constraint, known as the Hamiltonian (or scalar) constraint,\nis responsible for pushing data off the initial surface, and thus is\nrelated to the lapse function. If the constraints are not satisfied by\nthe canonical initial data then the development of the data with\nrespect to the evolution equations, will not generate a physically\npossible spacetime for choices of lapse and shift. However, when the\nconstraints are satisfied then the various choices of lapse and\nshift will always grow the same 4D spacetime (that it, the same\nspacetime metric). However, to extract a notion of time from this\nformulation demands that one first solve for the spacetime metric,\nfollowed by a singling out of a specific solution. This is a kind of\nclassical problem of time in that since the spacetime geometry is a\ndynamical variable, time is something that also must be solved for.\nFurther, there is arbitrariness in the time variable as a result of\nthe arbitrariness encoded in the constraints, stemming from the fact\nthat time is essentially a freely chosen label of the three\ndimensional slices and so is not a physical parameter. However, one\ncan extract a time for each solution to the Einstein equations\nby \u2018deparametrizing\u2019 the theory (i.e. isolating a variable\nfrom within the phase space that is to play the role of time). Below\nwe see that things become more problematic in the shift to quantum\ntheory.\n\nAlthough advocates of the canonical approach often accuse string\ntheorists of relying too heavily on classical background spacetime,\nthe canonical approach does something which is arguably quite similar,\nin that one begins with a theory that conceives time-evolution in\nterms of evolving some data specified on an a priori given\nspacelike surface, and then quantizing the theory. However, this does\nnot imply any breaking of spacetime diffeomorphism invariance (or\ngeneral covariance) since the constraints that must be satisfied by\nthe data on the slice mean that the physical observables of the theory\nwill be independent of whatever foliation one chooses. However, the\nproblem is that if spacetime is quantized along these lines, the\nassumption (of evolving then quantizing) does not make sense in\nanything but an approximate way. That is, the evolution does not\ngenerate a classical spacetime! Rather, solutions will be\nwave-functions (solutions of some Schr\u00f6dinger-type equation).\nThis issue in particular is decidedly neglected in both the physical\nand philosophical literature (but see Isham, 1993), and there is more\nthat might be said. We return to the issue of time in quantum gravity\nbelow.\n3.2.1 Geometric variables\n\nEarly attempts at quantizing general relativity by Bergmann, Dirac,\nPeres, Wheeler, DeWitt and others in the 1950s and 1960s worked with a\nseemingly natural choice for configuration variables, namely geometric\nvariables gij corresponding to the various\ncomponents of the \u2018three-metric\u2019 describing the intrinsic\ngeometry of the given spatial slice of spacetime. One can think about\narriving at this via an arbitrary slicing of a 4-dimensional\n\u201cblock\u201d universe by 3-dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces.\nThe conjugate momenta \u03c0ij then effectively\nencode the time rate-of-change of the metric, which, from the\n4-dimensional perspective, is directly related to the extrinsic\ncurvature of the slice (meaning the curvature relative to the\nspacetime in which the slice is embedded). This approach is known as\n\u2018geometrodynamics\u2019 since it views general relativity as\ndescribing the dynamics of spatial geometry.\n\nAs mentioned above, in these geometric variables, as in any other\ncanonical formulation of general relativity, one is faced with\nconstraints, which encode the fact that the canonical variables cannot\nbe specified independently. A familiar example of a constraint is\nGauss\u2019s law from ordinary electromagnetism, which states that,\nin the absence of charges,\n\u2207\u00b7E(x)\n\u2212 4\u03c0\u03c1 = 0 at every point x. It\nmeans that the three components of the electric field at every point\nmust be chosen so as to satisfy this constraint, which in turn means\nthat there are only two \u201ctrue\u201d degrees of freedom\npossessed by the electric field at any given point in space.\n(Specifying two components of the electric field at every point\ndictates the third component.) Thus, not all components of the Maxwell\nequations propagate the fields in a physical sense. \n\nThe constraints in electromagnetism may be viewed as stemming from the\nU(1) gauge invariance of Maxwell\u2019s theory, while the\nconstraints of general relativity stem from the diffeomorphism\ninvariance of the theory.\n Diffeomorphism invariance\n means, informally, that one can take a solution of Einstein\u2019s\nequations and drag it (meaning the metric and the matter fields)\naround on the spacetime manifold and obtain a mathematically distinct\nbut physically equivalent solution. The three\n\u2018supermomentum\u2019 constraints in the canonical theory\nreflect the freedom to drag the metric and matter fields around in\nvarious directions on a given three-dimensional spacelike\nhypersurface, while the \u2018super-Hamiltonian\u2019 constraint\nreflects the freedom to drag the fields in the \u201ctime\u201d\ndirection, and so to the \u201cnext\u201d hypersurface. (Each\nconstraint applies at each point of the given spacelike hypersurface,\nso that there are actually 4 \u00d7 \u221e3 constraints:\nfour for each point.) In the classical (unquantized) canonical\nformulation of general relativity, the constraints do not pose any\nparticular conceptual problems (though one does face a problem in\ndefining suitable observables that commute with the constraints, and\nthis certainly has a conceptual flavour). One effectively chooses a\nbackground space and time (via a choice of the lapse and shift\nfunctions) \u201con the fly\u201d, and one can be confident that the\nspacetime that results is independent of the particular choice.\nEffectively, different choices of these functions give rise to\ndifferent choices of background against which to evolve the\nforeground. However, the constraints pose a serious problem (as much\nconceptual as technical) when one moves to quantum theory.\n3.2.2 Problem of time\n\nAll approaches to canonical quantum gravity face the so-called\n\u201cproblem of time\u201d in one form or another (Kucha\u0159\n(1992) and Isham (1993) are still excellent reviews; Rickles, 2006,\noffers a more philosophical guide). The problem stems from the fact\nthat in preserving the diffeomorphism-invariance of general relativity\n\u2014 depriving the coordinates of the background manifold of any\nphysical meaning \u2014 the \u201cslices\u201d of spacetime one is\nconsidering inevitably include time, just as they include space. In\nthe canonical formulation, the diffeomorphism invariance is reflected\nin the constraints, and the inclusion of what would ordinarily be a\n\u2018time\u2019 variable in the data is reflected in the existence\nof the super-Hamiltonian constraint. The difficulties presented by\nthis latter constraint constitute the problem of time.\n\nAttempts to quantize general relativity in the canonical framework\nproceed by turning the canonical variables into operators on an\nappropriate state space (e.g., the space of square-integrable\nfunctions over three-metrics), and dealing somehow with the\nconstraints. When quantizing a theory with constraints, there are two\npossible approaches. The approach usually adopted in gauge theories is\nto deal with the constraints before quantization, so that only\ntrue degrees of freedom are promoted to operators when passing to the\nquantum theory. There are a variety of ways of doing this so-called\n\u2018gauge fixing\u2019, but they all involve removing the extra\ndegrees of freedom by imposing some special conditions. In general\nrelativity, fixing a gauge is tantamount to specifying a particular\ncoordinate system with respect to which the \u201cphysical\u201d\ndata is described (spatial coordinates) and with respect to which it\nevolves (time coordinate). This is difficult already at the classical\nlevel, since the utility and, moreover, the very tractability of any\nparticular gauge generally depends on the properties of the solution\nto the equations, which of course is what one is trying to find in the\nfirst place. But in the quantum theory, one is faced with the\nadditional concern that the resulting theory may well not be\nindependent of the choice of gauge. This is closely related to the\nproblem of identifying true, gauge-invariant observables in the\nclassical theory (Torre 2005, in the Other Internet Resources\nsection).\n\nThe preferred approach in canonical quantum gravity is to impose the\nconstraints after quantizing. In this \u2018constraint\nquantization\u2019 approach, due to Dirac, one treats the constraints\nthemselves as operators A, and demands that\n\u201cphysical\u201d states \u03c8 be those which are solutions to\nthe resulting equations A \u03c8 = 0. The problem of time is\nassociated with the super-Hamiltonian constraint, as mentioned above.\nThe super-Hamiltonian H is responsible for describing\ntime-evolution in the classical theory, yet its counterpart in the\nconstraint-quantized theory, H \u03c8 = 0, would prima\nfacie seem to indicate that the true physical states of the\nsystem do not evolve at all: there is no t. Trying to\nunderstand how, and in what sense, the quantum theory describes the\ntime-evolution of something, be it states or observables, is the\nessence of the problem of time (on which, more below).\n3.2.3 Ashtekar, loop, and other variables\n\nIn geometrodynamics, all of the constraint equations are difficult to\nsolve (though the super-Hamiltonian constraint, known as the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation, is especially difficult), even in the absence\nof particular boundary conditions. Lacking solutions, one does not\nhave a grip on what the true, physical states of the theory are, and\none cannot hope to make much progress in the way of predictions. The\ndifficulties associated with geometric variables are addressed by the\nprogram initiated by Ashtekar and developed by his collaborators (for\na review and further references see Rovelli 2001b (Other Internet\nResources), 2001a). Ashtekar used a different set of variables, a\ncomplexified \u2018connection\u2019 (rather than a three-metric) and\nits canonical conjugate, which made it simpler to solve the\nconstraints. This change of variables introduces an additional\nconstraint into the theory (the Gauss law constraint generating SO(3)\ntransformations) on account of the freedom to rotate the vectors\nwithout disturbing the metric. The program underwent further\nrefinements with the introduction of the loop transform, and further\nrefinements still when it was understood that equivalence classes of\nloops could be identified with spin networks. One is able to recover\nall the standard geometrical features of general relativity from this\nformulation. (See Smolin (2001, 2004) for a popular introduction;\nRovelli, 2004, offers a physically intuitive account; Thiemann, 2008,\nprovides the mathematical underpinnings; Rickles, 2005, offers a\nphilosophically-oriented review.) Note that the problems of time and\nobservables afflict the loop approach just as they did the earlier\ngeometrodynamical approach. The difference is that one has more\n(mathematical) control over the theory (and its quantization), in\nterms of a definable inner product, a separable state space, and more.\nThere is still a question mark over the construction of the full\nphysical Hilbert space, since the solution of the Hamiltonian\nconstraint remains a problem. However, some progress is being made in\nvarious directions, e.g. Thomas Thiemann\u2019s master constraint\nprogramme (see Thiemann, 2006).\n3.3 Other Approaches\n\nThough the impression often painted of the research landscape in\nquantum gravity is an either/or situation between string theory and\nloop quantum gravity, in reality there are very many more options on\nthe table. Some (e.g., Callender and Huggett 2001, W\u00fcthrich 2004\n(Other Internet Resources section); J. Mattingly 2005) have argued\nthat semiclassical gravity, a theory in which matter is quantized but\nspacetime is classical, is at least coherent, though not quite an\nempirically viable option (we discuss this below). Other approaches\ninclude twistor theory (currently enjoying a revival in conjunction\nwith string theory), Bohmian approaches (Goldstein & Teufel,\n2001), causal sets (see Sorkin 2003, in the Other Internet Resources\nsection) in which the universe is described as a set of discrete\nevents along with a stipulation of their causal relations, and other\ndiscrete approaches (see Loll, 1998). Causal set theory has begun to\nstimulate some philosophical interest on account of the claims, by\nphysicists, to the effect that the theory embodies a notion of\nobjective becoming or temporal passage based on the notion of the\n\u2018birth\u2019 of spacetime atoms (see, e.g., Dowker 2014; for a\nskeptical response, see Huggett 2014; W\u00fcthrich, 2012, pursues\ninstead the structuralist leanings of causal set theory). \n\nAlso of interest are arguments to the effect that gravity itself may\nplay a role in quantum state reduction (Christian, 2001; Penrose,\n2001; also briefly discussed below). A fairly comprehensive overview\nof the current approaches to quantum gravity can be found in Oriti\n(2009). In this entry we have chosen to focus upon those approaches\nthat are both the most actively pursued and that have received\nmost attention from philosophers. Let us now turn to several\nmethodological and philosophical issues that arise quantum gravity\nresearch.\n4. Methodology\n\nResearch in quantum gravity has always had a rather peculiar flavor,\nowing to both the technical and conceptual difficulty of the field and\nthe remoteness from experiment. Yoichiro Nambu (1985) wryly labels\nresearch on quantum gravity \u201cpostmodern physics\u201d on\naccount of its experimental remoteness. Thus conventional notions of\nthe close relationship between theory and experiment have but a\ntenuous foothold, at best, in quantum gravity. However, since there\nis a rudimentary \u2018pecking order\u2019 amongst the\nvarious approaches to quantum gravity, and since the history of\nquantum gravity contains various fatalities, there clearly are\nsome methods of theory evaluation in operation, there are\nconstraints functioning in something like the way experiment and\nobservation function. Investigating these methods and constraints\nconstitutes an open research problem for philosophers of\nscience\u2014for initial investigations along these lines, see James\nMattingly (2005a and 2009) and Rickles (2011). Audretsch (1981) argues\nthat quantum gravity research conflicts with Kuhn\u2019s account of\nscientific development since it stems from the desire to unify (for\nreasons not based on any empirical tension) multiple paradigms, both\nof which are well-confirmed and both of which make claims to\nuniversality. One might easily question Audretsch\u2019s focus on\ndirect empirical tensions here. Given, as he admits, both general\nrelativity and quantum theory claim to be universal theories,\nany conceptual or formal tension that can be found to hold between\nthem must point to either or both theories being in error in their\nclaims to universality\u2014this is an empirical claim of sorts. In\nthe context of string theory, Peter Galison (1995) argues that\nmathematical constraints take the place of standard empirical\nconstraints. James Cushing (1990) also considers some of the potential\nmethodological implications of string theory (though he deals with\nstring theory in its earliest days, when it underwent a transition\nfrom the dual resonance model of hadrons into a theory of quantum\ngravity). Dawid (2014) focuses in more detail on methodological issues\nin string theory and defends the idea that string theory is\ncharacterised by a uniqueness claim (the no-alternatives argument)\naccording to which string theory is the only way to unify\ngravity and the other fundamental interactions, thus grounding\nphysicists\u2019 strong belief in the theory; however, that is a\nrather different problem (that of constructing a theory of everything)\nthan the more restricted problem of quantum gravity \u2014 quantum\ngravity researchers from other approaches might simply reject the need\nfor such a unified theory (e.g., as opposed to a theory that is\ncompatible with the inclusion of other interactions). \n4.1 Theory\n\nAs remarked in the introduction, there is no single, generally\nagreed-upon body of theory in quantum gravity. The majority of the\nphysicists working in the field focus their attention on string\ntheory, an ambitious program which aims at providing a unified theory\nof all four interactions. A non-negligible minority work on what is\nnow called loop quantum gravity, the goal of which is simply to\nprovide a quantum theory of the gravitational interaction\nsimpliciter. There is also significant work in other areas,\nincluding approaches that don\u2019t really involve the quantization\nof a theory at all. [Good recent reviews of the theoretical landscape\ninclude Carlip 2001, Smolin 2001 (Other Internet Resources section\nbelow), 2003, Penrose 2004, and Oriti, ed, 2009.] But there is no real\nconsensus, for at least two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that it is extremely difficult to make any\nconcrete predictions in these theories. String theory, in particular,\nis plagued by a lack of experimentally testable predictions because of\nthe tremendous number of distinct ground or vacuum states in the\ntheory, with an absence of guiding principles for singling out the\nphysically significant ones (including our own). Though the string\ncommunity prides itself on the dearth of free parameters in the theory\n(in contrast to the nineteen or so free parameters found in the\nstandard model of particle physics), the problem arguably resurfaces\nin the huge number of vacua associated with different\ncompactifications of the nine space dimensions to the three we\nobserve. These vacua are either viewed as distinct string theories, or\nelse as solutions of one and the same theory (though some deeper,\nunknown theory, as mentioned above). Attempts to explain why we live\nin the particular vacuum that we do have recently given rise to\nappeals to the infamous anthropic principle (Susskind, 2003), whereby\nthe existence of humans (or observers) is invoked to, in some sense,\n\u201cexplain\u201d the fact that we find ourselves in a particular\nworld by restricting the possible ground states to those that could\nsupport such creatures in which we should expect our universe\u2019s\nobserved features to be typical. (See Weinstein, 2006, for a\nphilosophical discussion of the usage of anthropic reasoning in string\ntheory, including an ambiguity in the meaning of\n\u2018typicality\u2019 in this context; Azhar, 2013, further\ndevelops this discussion.)\n\nLoop quantum gravity is seemingly less plagued by a lack of\npredictions, and indeed it is often claimed that the discreteness of\narea and volume operators are concrete predictions of the theory, with\npotentially testable consequences. Proponents of this approach argue\nthat this makes the theory more susceptible to falsification, and thus\nmore scientific (in the sense of Popper; see the entry on\n Karl Popper)\n than string theory (see Smolin 2006 for this line of argument).\nHowever, it is still quite unclear, in practice and even in principle,\nhow one might actually observe these quantities. There have been\nrecent suggestions that in order to probe the effects of the Planck\nscale (discreteness, or minimal length in particular) one needs to\nlook to the cosmological level for tiny violations of Lorentz\ninvariance. Rovelli and Speziale (2003) have argued that, in fact, the\nexistence of a minimal length does not imply a violation of the\nLorentz symmetry (a conclusion seconded by the proponents of the\ncausal set programme). Their argument turns on the fact that in the\ncontext of quantum theory, symmetries act on states (and so on mean\nvalues) rather than eigenvalues (representing the discrete quantities\nin the theory). However, in any case, there remains a question mark\nover the theoretical status of the discreteness result which has been\nshown to hold only for operators on the kinematical Hilbert\nspace, that is, for gauge-variant quantities. It is still an open\nquestion whether this result transfers to genuine observables (i.e.\noperators that satisfy all of the constraints and are defined on the\nphysical Hilbert space: that gauge-invariant quantities). See\nDittrich and Thiemann (2009) for a detailed investigation of the\nproblem and a possible resolution employing suitably gauge-fixed (by\nmatter) Dirac observables. Even if one overcomes this problem, and\ncould observe evidence of the discreteness of space, so many\napproaches involve such discreteness that one would face a further\nproblem in using this new data to decide between the discrete\napproaches. For a philosophical discussion of this and related issues\n(including the question of whether the proposed discreteness breaks\nLorentz invariance), see Hagar (2009) \u2014 Hagar (2014) considers\nthese and related issues in a book-length treatment.\n4.2 Experiment\n\nThe second reason for the absence of consensus is that there are no\nexperiments in quantum gravity, and little in the way of observations\nthat might qualify as direct or indirect data or empirical evidence.\nThis stems in part from the lack of theoretical predictions,\nsince it is difficult to design an observational test of a theory if\none does not know where to look or what to look at. But it also stems\nfrom the fact that most theories of quantum gravity appear to predict\ndepartures from classical relativity only at energy scales on the\norder of 1019 GeV. (By way of comparison, the proton-proton\ncollisions at Fermilab have an energy on the order of 103\nGeV.) Whereas research in particle physics proceeds in large part by\nexamining the data collected in large particle accelerators, which are\nable to smash particles together at sufficiently high energies to\nprobe the properties of atomic nuclei in the fallout, gravity is so\nweak that there is no physically realistic way to do a comparable\nexperiment that would reveal properties at the energy scales at which\nquantum gravitational effects are expected to be\nimportant\u2014it would take a particle accelerator of galactic size\nto even approach the required energies. (In a little more detail, the\nweakness of gravity can be compared to the strength of the\nelectromagnetic interaction \u2014 cf. Callender and Huggett (eds.)\n2001, p. 4. An electron couples to the electromagnetic field with a\nstrength of 10\u22122, while the coupling of a mass to the\ngravitational field is 10\u221222. Feynman (1963, p. 697)\ngives an example that highlights this difference in magnitudes more\ndramatically by showing how the gravitational coupling between a\nproton and an electron in a hydrogen atom would shift the\nwave-function of an electron by just 43 arcseconds over a time period\nof 100 times the age of the Universe! Hence, quantum gravity is more\nof a theorist\u2019s problem.)\n\nThough progress is being made in trying to at least draw observational\nconsequences of loop quantum gravity, a theory of quantum gravity\nwhich arguably does make predictions (Amelino-Camelia, 2003,\nin the Other Internet Resources section below; D. Mattingly, 2005), it\nis remarkable that the most notable \u201ctest\u201d of quantum\ntheories of gravity imposed by the community to date involves a\nphenomenon which has never been observed, the so-called Hawking\nradiation from black holes. Based on earlier work of Bekenstein (1973)\nand others, Hawking (1974) predicted that black holes would radiate\nenergy, and would do so in proportion to their gravitational\n\u201ctemperature,\u201d which was in turn understood to be\nproportional to their mass, angular momentum, and charge. Associated\nwith this temperature is an entropy (see the entry on\n the philosophy of statistical mechanics),\n and one would expect a theory of quantum gravity to allow one to\ncalculate the entropy associated with a black hole of given mass,\nangular momentum, and charge, the entropy corresponding to the number\nof quantum (micro-)states of the gravitational field having the same\nmass, charge, and angular momentum. (See Unruh, 2001, and references\ntherein.) In their own ways, string theory and loop quantum gravity\nhave both passed the test of predicting an entropy for black holes\nwhich accords with Hawking\u2019s calculation, using very different\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom. String theory gets the number right\nfor a not-particularly-physically-realistic subset of black holes\ncalled near-extremal black holes, while loop quantum gravity gets it\nright for generic black holes, but only up to an overall constant.\nMore recently, the causal set approach has also managed to derive the\ncorrect value. If the Hawking effect is real, then this\nconsonance could be counted as evidence in favor of either or both/all\ntheories.\n\nErik Curiel (2001) has argued against the manner in which the ability\nto derive the Bekenstein-Hawking result as a theorem of an approach is\nused as evidence for that approach in much the same way that\nempirical evidence is used to justify a theory in normal\ncircumstances, say predicting the value of a well-confirmed\nexperimental result. It is true that black hole physics is used as\ntesting ground for quantum gravity and the Bekenstein-Hawking result\ndoes not have the status of an empirical fact. However, it is a strong\ndeduction from a framework that is fairly mature, namely\nquantum field theory on a curved spacetime background. In this sense,\nalthough it does not provide a constraint as strong as an\nexperimentally observed phenomenon, it might legitimately function as\na constraint on possible theories. Constraints on theory construction\ncome in a variety of shapes and sizes, and not all take the form of\nempirical data \u2014 thought experiments are a case in point. In the\ncontext of quantum gravity it is especially important that one have\nsome agreed upon constraints to guide the construction. Without them,\nwork would halt. It also seems reasonable to insist that a full theory\nof quantum gravity be able to reproduce predictions of the\nsemi-classical theory of gravity, since this will be one of its\npossible limits. Still, Curiel is right that researchers ought to be\nrather more wary of attributing too much evidential weight to such\nfeatures that remain empirically unconfirmed.\n\nCuriel goes on to question, more generally, the ranking of approaches\nto quantum gravity given what he views as the absence of demonstrated\nscientific merit in any of them: elegance and consistency might well\nbe merits of a scientific theory, but they do not count as\nscientific. (ibid, p. S437). However, this claim hinges on the\ndirect alignment of scientific merit and empirical clout; but this\nrequires an argument, for it is far from obvious: from whence this\nprescription? Surely if a theory is mathematically inconsistent that\nsays something about its physical status too? Moreover, the\nrelationship between experimental and observational data and theories\nis not a simple matter. Finally, it is perhaps too quick to say that\napproaches do not have empirical consequences. Already known empirical\ndata can confirm the predictions of a theory; therefore, it is clear\nthat we can judge the extent to which the various contenders satisfy\nthis old evidence, and how they do so. For example, string theory at\nleast has the potential of explaining why there are three generations\nof elementary particles by invoking the Euler characteristic of the\ncompact spaces it employs\u2014the Euler characteristic is equal to\ntwice the number of generations (see Seifert, 2004, for details).\nWhatever one might think about string theory\u2019s relationship with\nanthropic reasoning, we do have here a potential explanation of a\npreviously inexplicable piece of old empirical data, which ought to\nlend some credence to the theory. There is also the not inconsiderable\nfact that string theory is able to derive general relativity (and all\nthe physically observed facts that are associated with this theory) as\na low energy feature. This is not a novel fact, but it is an\nphysical, empirical consequence of the theory nonetheless.\n\nHowever, it should be noted, finally, that to date neither of the main\nresearch programs has been shown to properly reproduce the world we\nsee at low energies. Indeed, it is a major challenge of loop quantum\ngravity to show that it indeed has general relativity as a low-energy\nlimit, and a major challenge of string theory to show that it has the\nstandard model of particle physics plus general relativity as a\nlow-energy limit. There are promising indications that both theories\nmight be able to overcome this challenge (see Thiemann for the loop\nquantum gravity case; for the string theoretic case, see Gra\u00f1a,\n2006). A similar problem faces causal set theory in the form of the\n\u2018inverse problem\u2019, which roughly amounts to the difficulty\nof getting continuous manifolds (with their corresponding symmetries)\nfrom a fundamentally discrete theory (see Wallden, 2010, for a good\nrecent review of causal sets, including a discussion of this problem,\non which progress has also been made).\n5. Philosophical Issues\n\nQuantum gravity raises a number of difficult philosophical questions.\nTo date, it is the ontological aspects of quantum gravity that have\nattracted the most interest from philosophers, and it is these we will\ndiscuss in the first five sections below. In the final section,\nthough, we will briefly discuss some further methodological and\nepistemological issues which arise.\n\nFirst, however, let us discuss the extent to which ontological\nquestions are tied to a particular theoretical framework. In its\ncurrent stage of development, string theory unfortunately provides\nlittle indication of the more fundamental nature of space, time, and\nmatter. Despite the consideration of ever more exotic objects \u2014\nstrings, p-branes, D-branes, etc. \u2014 these objects are\nstill understood as propagating in a background spacetime. Since\nstring theory is supposed to describe the emergence of classical\nspacetime from some underlying quantum structure, these objects are\nnot to be regarded as truly fundamental. Rather, their status in\nstring theory is analogous to the status of particles in quantum field\ntheory (Witten, 2001), which is to say that they are relevant\ndescriptions of the fundamental physics only in situations in which\nthere is a background spacetime with appropriate symmetries. While\nthis suggests tantalising links to issues of emergence, it is\ndifficult to pursue them without knowing the details of the more\nfundamental theory. As already mentioned, the duality relations\nbetween the various string theories suggest that they are all\nperturbative expansions of some more fundamental, non-perturbative\ntheory known as \u2018M-theory\u2019 (Polchinski, 2002, see the\nOther Internet Resources section below). This, presumably, is the most\nfundamental level, and understanding the theoretical framework at that\nlevel is central to understanding the underlying ontology of the\ntheory (and so the manner in which any other structures might emerge\nfrom it). \u2018Matrix theory\u2019 is an attempt to do just this,\nto provide a mathematical formulation of M-theory, but it remains\nhighly speculative. Thus although string theory purports to be a\nfundamental theory, the ontological implications of the theory are\nstill very obscure \u2014 though this could be viewed as a challenge\nrather than a reason to ignore the theory.\n\nCanonical quantum gravity, in its loop formulation or otherwise, has\nto date been of greater interest to philosophers because it appears to\nconfront fundamental questions in a way that string theory, at least\nin its perturbative guise, does not \u2014 certainly, it does so more\nexplicitly and in language more amenable to philosophers. Whereas\nperturbative string theory treats spacetime in an essentially\nclassical way, canonical quantum gravity treats it as\nquantum-mechanical entity, at least to the extent of treating the\ngeometric structure (as opposed to, say, the topological or\ndifferential structure) as quantum-mechanical. Furthermore, many of\nthe issues facing canonical quantum gravity are also firmly rooted in\nconceptual difficulties facing the classical theory, which\nphilosophers are already well acquainted with (e.g. via the\n hole argument).\n5.1 Time\n\nAs noted in\n Section 3.2.2\n above, the treatment of time presents special difficulties in\ncanonical quantum gravity, though they easily generalise to many other\napproaches to quantum gravity. These difficulties are connected with\nthe special role time plays in physics, and in quantum theory in\nparticular. Physical laws are, in general, laws of motion, of change\nfrom one time to another. They represent change in the form of\ndifferential equations for the evolution of, as the case may be,\nclassical or quantum states; the state represents the way the system\nis at some time, and the laws allow one to predict how it\nwill be in the future (or retrodict how it was in the past). It is not\nsurprising, then, that a theory of quantum spacetime would have a\nproblem of time, because there is no classical time against which to\nevolve the \u201cstate\u201d. The problem is not so much that the\nspacetime is dynamical; there is no problem of time in classical\ngeneral relativity (in the sense that a time variable is present).\nRather, the problem is roughly that in quantizing the structure of\nspacetime itself, the notion of a quantum state, representing the\nstructure of spacetime at some instant, and the notion of the\nevolution of the state, do not get any traction, since there\nare no real \u201cinstants\u201d. (In some approaches to canonical\ngravity, one fixes a time before quantizing, and quantizes the\nspatial portions of the metric only. This approach is not without its\nproblems, however; see Isham (1993) for discussion and further\nreferences.)\n\nOne can ask whether the problem of time arising from the canonical\nprogram tells us something deep and important about the nature of\ntime. Julian Barbour (2001a,b), for one, thinks that it tells us that\ntime is illusory (see also Earman, 2002, in this connection). It is\nargued that the fact that quantum states do not evolve under the\nsuper-Hamiltonian means that there is no change. However, it can also\nbe argued (Weinstein, 1999a,b) that the super-Hamiltonian itself\nshould not be expected to generate time-evolution; rather, one or more\n\u201ctrue\u201d Hamiltonians should play this role, though\nuncovering such Hamiltonians is no easy matter. (See Butterfield &\nIsham (1999) and Rovelli (2006) for further discussion.)\n\nBradley Monton (2006) has argued that a specific version of canonical\nquantum gravity \u2013 that with a so-called constant mean\nextrinsic curvature [CMC] (or fixed) foliation \u2013 has the\nnecessary resources to render presentism (the view that all and only\npresently existing things exist) a live possibility (see the section\non Presentism, Eternalism, and The Growing Universe Theory in the\nentry on\n time\n for more on presentism). The reason is that with such a fixed\nfoliation one has at one\u2019s disposal some spacelike hypersurface\nthat contains a set of well-defined events that can be viewed through\nthe lens of presentism, such that this set of events at this\nparticular instant (or \u2018thin-sandwich\u2019) changes over time.\nThough he readily admits that CMC formulations are outmoded in the\ncontemporary theoretical landscape, he nonetheless insists that given\nthe lack of experimental evidence one way or the other, it stands as a\nviable route to quantum gravity, and therefore presentism remains as a\npossible theory of time that is compatible with frontier theoretical\nphysics. Christian W\u00fcthrich (2010) takes Monton to task on a\nvariety of both technical and non-technical grounds. He rightly\nquestions Monton\u2019s claim that the CMC approach really is an\napproach to quantum gravity, in the same sense as string theory\nand loop quantum gravity. It is more of a piece of machinery that is\nused within a pre-existing approach (namely, the canonical\napproach). He also questions Monton\u2019s claim, inasmuch as it does\nconstitute an approach of sorts, that it is viable. Simply not\nbeing ruled out on experimental grounds does not thereby render an\napproach viable. Besides, if anything has the prospect of saving\npresentism, then surely it is Julian Barbour\u2019s position\nmentioned above. This at least has the added benefit of being a\nresearch programme that is being actively pursued.\n\nA common claim that appears in many discussions of the problem of time\n(especially amongst philosophers) is that it is restricted to\ncanonical formulations of general relativity, and has something to do\nwith the Hamiltonian formalism (see Rickles 2008a, pp. 340\u20131 for\nmore details). The confusion lies in the apparently very different\nways that time is treated in general relativity as standardly\nformulated, and as it appears in a canonical, Hamiltonian formulation.\nIn the former there is no preferred temporal frame, whereas the latter\nappears to demand such a frame in order to get off the ground\n(cf. Curiel, 2009, p. 59; Tim Maudlin (2004) tells a broadly similar\nstory).\n\nHowever, this encodes several pieces of misinformation making it hard\nto make sense of the claim that general relativity and canonical\ntheories cannot be \u201creconciled\u201d. The canonical framework\nis simply a tool for constructing theories, and one that makes\nquantization an easier prospect. As a matter of historical fact the\ncanonical formulation of general relativity is a completed project,\nand has been carried out in a variety of ways, using compact spaces\nand non-compact spaces, and with a range of canonical variables. Of\ncourse, general relativity, like Maxwell\u2019s theory of\nelectromagnetism, possesses gauge symmetries, so it is a constrained\ntheory that results, and one must employ the method of constrained\nHamiltonian systems. However, there is no question that general\nrelativity is compatible with the canonical analysis of theories, and\nthe fact that time looks a little strange in this context is simply\nbecause the formalism is attempting to capture the dynamics of general\nrelativity. In any case, the peculiar nature of general relativity and\nquantum gravity, with respect to the treatment of time, resurfaces in\narguably the most covariant of approaches, the Feynman path-integral\napproach. In this case that central task is to compute the amplitude\nfor going from an initial state to a final state (where these states\nwill be given in terms of boundary data on a pair of initial and final\nhypersurfaces). The computation of this propagator proceeds \u00e0\nla sum-over-histories: one counts to the number of possible spacetimes\nthat might interpolate between the initial and final hypersurfaces.\nHowever, one cannot get around the fact that general relativity is a\ntheory with gauge freedom, and so whenever one has diffeomorphic\ninitial and final hypersurfaces, the propagator will be trivial.\n\nA similar confusion can be found in discussions of the related problem\nof defining observables in canonical general relativity. The claim\ngets its traction from the fact that it is very difficult to construct\nobservables in canonical general relativity, while (apparently) it is\nrelatively straightforward in the standard Lagrangian description.\n(See, e.g., Curiel, 2009, pp. 59\u201360, for an explicit statement\nof this claim. Curiel cites a theorem of Torre, 1993, to the effect\nthat there can be no local observables in compact spacetimes, to argue\nthat the canonical formulation is defective somehow.) Again, this\nrests on a misunderstanding over what the canonical formalism is and\nhow it is related to the standard spacetime formulation of general\nrelativity. That there are no local observables is not an artefact of\ncanonical general relativity. The notion that observables have to be\nnon-local (in this case, relational) is a generic feature that results\nprecisely from the full spacetime diffeomorphism invariance of general\nrelativity (and is, in fact, implicit in the theorem of Torre\nmentioned earlier). It receives a particularly transparent description\nin the context of the canonical approach because one can define\nobservables as quantities that commute with all of the constraints.\nThe same condition will hold for the four-dimensional versions, only\nthey will have to be spacetime diffeomorphism invariant in that case.\nThis will still rule out local observables since any quantities\ndefined at points or regions of the spacetime manifold will clearly\nfail to be diffeomorphism invariant. Hence, the problems of\nobservables (and the result that they must be either global or\nrelational in general relativity) is not a special feature of the\ncanonical formulation, but a generic feature of theories possessing\ndiffeomorphism invariance. As Ashtekar and Geroch point out,\n\u201c[s]ince time is essentially a geometrical concept [in general\nrelativity], its definition must be in terms of the metric. But the\nmetric is also the dynamical variable, so the flow of time becomes\nintertwined with the flow of the dynamics of the system\u201d (1974,\np. 1215).\n5.2 Ontology\n\nThe problem of time is closely connected with a general puzzle about\nthe ontology associated with \u201cquantum spacetime\u201d. Quantum\ntheory in general resists any straightforward ontological reading, and\nthis goes double for quantum gravity. In quantum mechanics,\none has particles, albeit with indefinite properties. In quantum field\ntheory, one again has particles (at least in suitably symmetric\nspacetimes), but these are secondary to the fields, which again are\nthings, albeit with indefinite properties. On the face of it, the only\ndifference in quantum gravity is that spacetime itself becomes a kind\nof quantum field, and one would perhaps be inclined to say that the\nproperties of spacetime become indefinite. But space and time\ntraditionally play important roles in individuating objects and their\nproperties\u2014in fact a field is in some sense a set of properties\nof spacetime points \u2014 and so the quantization of such raises\nreal problems for ontology.\n\nOne area that philosophers might profit from is in the investigation\nof the relational observables that appear to be necessitated by\ndiffeomorphism invariance. For example, since symmetries (such as the\ngauge symmetries associated with the constraints) come with quite a\nlot of metaphysical baggage attached (as philosophers of physics know\nfrom the\n hole argument),\n such a move involves philosophically weighty assumptions. For\nexample, the presence of symmetries in a theory would appear to allow\nfor more possibilities than one without, so eradicating the symmetries\n(by solving the constraints and going to the reduced, physical phase\nspace) means eradicating a chunk of possibility space: in particular,\none is eradicating states that are deemed to be physically equivalent,\ndespite having some formal differences in terms of representaton.\nHence, imposing the constraints involves some serious modal\nassumptions. Belot and Earman (2001) have argued that since the\ntraditional positions on the ontology of spacetime (relationalism and\nsubstantivalism) involve a commitment to a certain way of counting\npossibilities, the decision to eliminate symmetries can have serious\nimplications for the ontology one can then adopt. Further, if some\nparticular method (out of retaining or eliminating symmetries) were\nshown to be successful in the quest for quantizing gravity, then, they\nargue, one could have good scientific reasons for favouring one of\nsubstantivalism or relationalism. (See Belot, 2011a, for more on this\nargument; Rickles, 2008c, explicitly argues against the idea that\npossibility spaces have any relevance for spacetime ontology.)\n\nIn the loop quantum gravity program, the area and volume operators\nhave discrete spectra. Thus, like electron spins, they can\nonly take certain values. This suggests (but does not imply) that\nspace itself has a discrete nature, and perhaps time as well\n(depending on how one resolves the problem of time). This in turn\nsuggests that space does not have the structure of a differential\nmanifold, but rather that it only approximates such a manifold on\nlarge scales, or at low energies. A similar idea, that classical\nspacetime is an emergent entity, can be found in several\napproaches to quantum gravity (see Butterfield and Isham, 1999 and\n2001, for a discussion of emergence in quantum gravity). The\npossibility that a continuous structure (with continuous symmetries)\ncould emerge from a fundamentally discrete structure is a problem with\na clear philosophical flavour \u2014Huggett and W\u00fcthrich, eds.\n(2013) contains a variety of papers investigating this issue, with\ntheir own contribution focusing on the notion of recovering\n\u2018local beables\u2019 from such emergent theories. \n5.3 Status of quantum theory\n\nWhether or not spacetime is discrete, the quantization of spacetime\nentails that our ordinary notion of the physical world, that of matter\ndistributed in space and time, is at best an approximation. This in\nturn implies that ordinary quantum theory, in which one calculates\nprobabilities for events to occur in a given world, is inadequate as a\nfundamental theory. As suggested in the\n Introduction,\n this may present us with a vicious circle. At the very least, one\nmust almost certainly generalize the framework of quantum theory. This\nis an important driving force behind much of the effort in quantum\ncosmology to provide a well-defined version of the\n many-worlds\n or\n relative-state\n interpretations. Much work in this area has adopted the so-called\n\u2018decoherent histories\u2019 or \u2018consistent\nhistories\u2019 formalism, whereby quantum theories are understood to\nmake probabilistic predictions about entire (coarse-grained)\n\u2018histories\u2019. Almost all of this work to date construes\nhistories to be histories of spatiotemporal events, and thus\npresupposes a background spacetime; however, the incorporation of a\ndynamical, quantized spacetime clearly drives much of the\ncosmology-inspired work in this area.\n\nMore generally, one might step outside the framework of canonical,\nloop quantum gravity, and ask why one should only quantize the metric.\nAs pointed out by Isham (1994, 2002), it may well be that the\nextension of quantum theory to general relativity requires one to\nquantize, in some sense, not only the metric but also the underlying\ndifferential structure and topology. This is somewhat unnatural from\nthe standpoint where one begins with classical, canonical general\nrelativity and proceeds to \u201cquantize\u201d (since the\ntopological structure, unlike the metric structure, is not represented\nby a classical variable). But one might well think that one should\nstart with the more fundamental, quantum theory, and then investigate\nunder which circumstances one gets something that looks like a\nclassical spacetime.\n\nOne final issue we might mention here is whether there is a conflict\nbetween the superposition principle and general relativity. Curiel\nclaims that \u201c[t]here exists no physical phenomenon well\ncharacterized by experiment that cannot be accurately described by one\nof the two theories, and no physical phenomenon that suggests that one\nof the two is correct to the detriment of the other\u2019s\naccuracy\u201d (2001, p. S432). However, Roger Penrose (2004, Chapter\n30) has forcefully argued that the superposition principle can, in\nsome circumstances, threaten the principle of general covariance,\nsurely a core principle of general relativity! The idea is that if we\nprepare a lump of matter in a superposition of two position states\n(stationary in their ambient spacetime), \u03c7 and \u03c6, a state\nPenrose labels a \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Lump\u201d state,\nthen the superposition is represented by: |\u03a8\u27e9 =\nw|\u03c7\u27e9 + z|\u03c6\u27e9. Penrose then shows that a\nstationary gravitational field does nothing to affect the fact that\nany superposition of the (stationary) position states \u03c7 and \u03c6\nwill also be stationary. But then introducing the gravitational field\nof the lump itself raises a problem. By themselves, the components of\nthe superposition would not seem to raise problems, and we can simply\nthink of the field around the location associated with the\nlump\u2019s states individually as being nearly classical. Given the\nstationarity of the states \u03c7 and \u03c6, there will be a distinct\nKilling vector (i.e. a metric preserving vector field) associated with\neach them. The problem then arises: what of superpositions of these\nlump states? Are they stationary? Since the Killing vector fields of\nthe two component stationary states live on different spacetimes, with\ndifferent structures, it seems we don\u2019t have the invariant\nspatiotemporal structure needed to answer the question. To try and say\nthat the spacetime is really the same (the obvious answer) would\nconflict with general covariance since then one would be supposing a\nrobust notion of spacetime points which enables one to match up the\ntwo spacetimes. As we have seen above, Penrose\u2019s proposed\nsolution is to consider such superpositions as generating a kind of\ngeometric instability which causes the collapse of the\nsuperposition.\n\nOf course, one might question various moves in Penrose\u2019s\nreasoning here (especially as regards the nature of the gravitational\nfields of stationary quantum states), so there is clearly more to be\nsaid. But there is potentially a conflict (and a measurable one at\nthat: see Penrose, 2002) between the superposition principle and\nprinciples of general relativity. Those with experience of the\nstandard quantum measurement problem will find much to interest them\nin this problem.\n5.4 The Planck Scale\n\nIt is almost Gospel that quantum gravity is what happens when you\nreach the Planck scale. The standard refrain is that \u2018something\npeculiar\u2019 happens to our concepts of space, time, and causality\nat such such scales requiring radical revisions that must be described\nby the quantum theory of gravity (see, e.g., Rovelli, 2007, p. 1287).\nHowever, the arguments underlying this orthodoxy have not been\nrigorously examined. The usual motivation involves a dimensional\nanalysis argument. The scales at which theories make their mark are\nset by the values of the fundamental constants. In this way the\nconstants demarcate the domains of applicability of theories: c\ntells us when specially relativistic effects will become apparent,\n\u210f tells us when quantum effects will become apparent, and G\ntells us when gravitational effects will become apparent. As Planck\nwas able to demonstrate in 1899, these constants can be combined so as\nto uniquely determine a natural, absolute family of units that are\nindependent of all human and terrestrial baggage. The Planck length\ncan be written as\n(G\u210f/c3)\u00bd and has the\nvalue 10\u221233 in centimeters. Planck was not aware of\nthe relevance of the scale set by the constants to the applicability\nof general relativity, of course, but Arthur Eddington seems to have\nbeen aware (though getting a different value as a result of using\nOsborn Reynold\u2019s determination for the finest grain believed\npossible), writing in the March edition of Nature in 1918:\n\nFrom the combination of the fundamental constants, G, c,\nand h it is possible to form a new fundamental unit of length\nLmin = 7 \u00d7 10\u221228cm. It seems to be\ninevitable that this length must play some role in any complete\ninterpretation of gravitation. ... In recent years great progress has\nbeen made in knowledge of the excessively minute; but until we can\nappreciate details of structure down to the quadrillionth or\nquintillionth of a centimetre, the most sublime of all the forces of\nNature remains outside the purview of the theories of physics.\n(Eddington, 1918, p. 36)\n\n\nThe idea that the Planck length amounts to a minimal length in\nnature follows from the argument that if distances smaller than this\nlength are resolved (say in the measurement of the position of a\nmass), then it would require energies concentrated in a region so\nsmall that a mini-black hole would form, taking the observed system\nwith it \u2013 see Rovelli (2007, p. 1289) for this argument.\nMeschini (2007) is not convinced by such arguments, and doesn\u2019t\nsee that the case for the relevance of the Planck scale to quantum\ngravity research has been properly made. He is suspicious of the\nclaims made on behalf of dimensional analysis. There is something to\nMeschini\u2019s claims, for if the dimensional argument were true\nthen, without realising it, Planck would have stumbled upon the\nbeginnings of quantum gravity before either quantum field theory or\ngeneral relativity were devised! However, Meschini speculates that the\nfinal theory of quantum gravity \u201chas nothing to do with one or\nmore of the above-mentioned constants\u201d (p. 278). This seems too\nstrong a statement, since a core condition on a theory of quantum\ngravity will be to reduce to general relativity and quantum field\ntheory as we know it, according to limits involving these constants.\nNonetheless, Meschini is surely right that the details of these\ndimensional arguments, and the role of the Planck scale are calling\nout for a closer analysis.\n5.5 Background Structure\n\nIn non-generally relativistic theories the spacetime metric is frozen\nto a single value assignment for all times and all solutions: it is\nmodel independent. Of course, in general relativity the metric is what\none solves for: the metric is a dynamical variable, which implies that\nthe geometry of spacetime is dynamical. This intuitive notion is\nbundled into the concept of background freedom, or background\nindependence. In general, background independence is understood to be\nthe freedom of a theory from background structures, where the latter\namount to some kind of absolute, non-dynamical objects in a theory.\nThe extent to which their respective theories incorporate background\nstructures has recently proven to be a divisive subject amongst string\ntheorists and loop quantum gravity theorists and others. It is often\nclaimed that the central principle that distinguishes general\nrelativity from other theories is its (manifest) background\nindependence. But background independence is a slippery notion meaning\ndifferent things to different people. We face a series of questions\nwhen considering background independence: What, exactly, is it (beyond\nthe simple intuitive notion)? Why is it considered to be such an\nimportant principle? What theories incorporate it? To what\nextent do they incorporate it?\n\nThe debate between strings and loops on this matter is severely\nhampered by the fact that there is no firm definition of background\nindependence on the table and, therefore, the two camps are almost\ncertainly talking past each other when discussing this issue. It seems\nprima facie reasonable to think that in order to reproduce a\nmanifestly background independent theory like general relativity, a\nquantum theory of gravity should be background independent too, and so\nbackground independence has begun to function as a constraint on\nquantum gravity theories, in much the same way that renormalizability\nused to constrain the construction of quantum field theories.\nAdvocates of loop quantum gravity often highlight the background\nindependence of their theory as a virtue that it has over string\ntheory. However, there is no proof of this implication, and aspects of\nthe so-called \u2018holographic principle\u2019 seem to suggest that\na background independent theory could be dual to a background\ndependent theory (see the contributions to Biquard, ed., 2005).\nFurthermore, depending on how we define the intuitive notion of\nbackground independence, and if \u2018clues\u2019 from the duality\nsymmetries of M-theory are anything to go by, it looks like string\ntheory might even be more background independent than loop\nquantum gravity, for the dimensionality of spacetime becomes a\ndynamical variable too (cf. Stelle, 2000, p. 7).\n\nIndeed, various string theorists claim that their theory is background\nindependent. In many cases it seems that they have a different\nunderstanding of what this entails than loop quantum gravity\nresearchers\u2014this takes us to the first, definitional, question.\nIn particular some seem to think that the ability to place a general\nmetric in the Lagrangian amounts to background independence. This\nfalls short of the mark for how the majority of physicists understand\nit, namely as a reactive dynamical coupling between spacetime and\nmatter. Though one can indeed place a variety of metrics in the\nstringy Lagrangian, one does not then vary the metric in the action.\nThere is no interaction between the strings and the ambient spacetime.\nIndeed, this is not really distinct from quantum field theory of point\nparticles in curved spacetimes: the same freedom to insert a general\nmetric appears there too.\n\nThere is an alternative argument for the background independence of\nstring theory that comes from the field theoretic formulation of the\ntheory: string field theory. The idea is that classical spacetime\nemerges from the two dimensional conformal field theory on the strings\nworldsheet. However, in this case one surely has to say something\nabout the target space, for the worldsheet metric takes on a metric\ninduced from the ambient target spacetime. Yet another argument for\nthe background independence of string theory might point to the fact\nthat the dimensionality of spacetime in string theory has to satisfy\nan equation of motion (a consistency condition): this is how the\ndimensionality comes out (as 26 or 10, depending on whether one\nimposes supersymmetry). One contender for the definition of background\nindependence is a structure that is dynamical in the sense that one\nhas to solve equations of motion to get at its values. In this case we\nwould have extreme background independence stretching to the structure\nof the manifold itself. However, the problem with this is that this\nstructure is the same in all models of the theory; yet we intuitively\nexpect background independent theories to be about structures that can\nvary across a theory\u2019s models.\n\nThe issues here are clearly subtle and complex, and philosophers have\nonly just begun to consider them. The central problem faced, as a\nphilosopher, when trying to make sense of claims such as these is that\nthere is no solid, unproblematic definition of background structure\n(and therefore background independence and dependence) on the table.\nWithout this, one simply cannot decide who is right; one cannot decide\nwhich theories are background independent and which are not. Hence, an\nurgent issue in both physics and the philosophy of physics is to work\nout exactly what is meant by \u2018background independence\u2019 in\na way that satisfies all parties, that is formally correct, and that\nsatisfies our intuitive notions of the concept. Until this is\nachieved, background independence cannot be helpfully used to\ndistinguish the approaches, nor can we profitably discuss its merits.\nA serious attempt to define background independence in such a way as\nto make these tasks possible has been made by Domenico Giulini (2007).\nBut Giulini admits that a general definition still eludes us. The\nstumbling block might be that background independence simply\nisn\u2019t a formal property of theories at all. Gordon Belot (2011b)\nhas recently argued that background independence is partly an\ninterpretive matter, and that one can have varying levels of\nbackground independence (the latter notion is also defended by Lee\nSmolin, 2006). Rickles (2008b) argues that the place to seek a notion\nof background independence that can be put to use in the quantum\ngravitational context is by focusing on the kinds of\nobservables that an approach employs, rather than squarely on\nproperties of the equations of motion.\n5.6 Necessity of Quantization\n\nIn earlier research on quantum gravity it was often supposed that if\nthere was at least one quantum field in the world together with the\ngravitational field, then given the universal coupling of the\ngravitational field, it must follow that the quantization of the one\nfield somehow infects the gravitational field, implying that it must\nnecessarily have quantum properties too. The arguments basically\ninvolve the consideration of a mass prepared in a superposition of\nposition eigenstates. If the gravitational field remained classical\n(and, therefore, not constrained by the uncertainty relations) then\none could violate the uncertainty relations by simply making\nmeasurements of the gravitational field, discovering the properties of\nthe quantized matter to which it was coupled. However, all attempts at\nmaking this argument stick have so far failed, meaning that there is\nno logical necessity demanding that we quantize the gravitational\nfield. Given that we also seemingly lack experimental reasons for\nquantization of the gravitational field (since we have not observed\nevidence of its quantum properties), several physicists (and\nphilosophers) have questioned the programme as it stands. It is, they\nargue, a matter for experiment to decide, not logic. Note, however,\nthat this does not mean that the project of quantum gravity itself\nrests on unsteady ground: if there are quantum fields and\ngravitational fields in the world, then given the nature of gravity,\nwe need to say something about the manner in which they\ninteract. What is being questioned is whether this means that gravity\ncannot itself remain fundamentally classical while interacting with\nquantum fields. After all, as far as all our experiments show: gravity\nis classical and matter is quantum. This pessimistic argument is\nusually traced back to Rosenfeld, though he wavered somewhat on the\nmatter (see DeWitt and Rickles, 2011, p. 164 and p. 170, for\nRosenfeld\u2019s original arguments).\n\nIf it is to remain fundamentally classical, then there is the simple\nquestion of what such a classical gravitational field would couple to.\nThe quantum properties? That seems problematic for the reasons given\nabove. Moreover, given the form of the Einstein field equations, with\na classical c-number on the left hand side, that would mean equating a\nc-number with a q-number (i.e. a quantum operator). The standard way\nout of this problem is to couple the gravitational field instead to\nthe expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of some quantized\nmatter field. The expectation value is a c-number. There have been a\nvariety of arguments and no-go theorems against this so-called\nsemi-classical gravitational theory, most of which replay the kind of\nargument invoking violations of the uncertainty relations sketched\nabove (see Eppley and Hannah 1977, and Page and Geilker 1981).\nBasically, the upshot of the Eppley and Hannah paper is that, given\nthe coexistence of classical gravity and quantum fields, two things\ncan happen upon a gravitational field measurement: on the one hand the\nquantum wavefunction could collapse, in which case there is momentum\nnon-conservation. On the other hand, the measurement could leave the\nquantum wavefunction in a coherent state, in which case signals can be\nsent faster than light. Mattingly (2006) argues that, when properly\nanalyzed, the thought experiments employed by Eppley and Hannah\nviolate basic physical principles involving the construction of the\nequipment that would be needed to make the necessary field\nmeasurements \u2014 however, while not viewing the original\nsemi-classical approach as a viable option, Mattingly argues that an\nextension of the approach has the potential to reveal a viable theory\nof micro-gravity (see Mattingly 2010 and 2014). Adrian Kent has\nrecently argued that general hybrid classical/quantum theories\n(including those involving gravity) need not allow superluminal\nsignalling or violate relativity (Kent 2018).\n\nA batch of new approaches based on analogies with condensed matter\nphysics and hydrodynamics point to another way in which gravity can\nescape quantization, though not in a truly fundamental sense.\nAccording to such approaches, gravity is emergent in the sense that\nthe metric (or connection) variables, and other variables representing\ngravitational features, are collective variables that only appear at\nenergies away from the Planck scale. In other words, gravity is a\npurely macroscopic, low energy phenomenon and general relativity is an\neffective field theory. This leaves the task of actually filling in\nthe details of the microscopic structure of spacetime (the\n\u2018atoms of spacetime\u2019) out of which the low energy\ncollective variables emerge (see Hu, 2009, for a conceptually oriented\nreview of such approaches; Crowther 2014 provides a detailed\nphilosophical analysis). As Rovelli notes (2007, p. 1304), the mere\nfact that the gravitational field is an emergent, collective variable\ndoes not thereby imply an absence of quantum effects, and it is\npossible that collective variables too are governed by quantum\ntheory.\n\nW\u00fcthrich (2005, pp. 779\u201380) has argued that the very\nexistence of approaches to quantum gravity that do not involve the\nquantization of the gravitational field means that quantization of the\ngravitational field has to be a contingent matter. However,\nthis seems to rest on a mistake. It might still be the case that there\nare reasons of logical consistency forbidding the union of a classical\nand quantum field even though there are entirely distinct\nnon-quantization approaches. For example, string theory does not\nquantize the gravitational field; however, it is clearly wrong to say\nthat the existence of this position would be ruled out if the various\nno-go theorems outlawing hybrid classical-quantum theories were true.\nThe fact that one can isolate states corresponding to gravitons in the\nstring spectrum stands quite independent from issues over the\ninteraction of classical and quantum field. The question of the\nnecessity of quantization (as a result of coupling a classical\ngravitational field to quantum fields) should be held separate from\nthe prospect of producing a quantum theory of gravity that does not\ninvolve gravitational field quantization, for both input theories, for\ndescribing the classical and quantum fields, could be fundamentally\nwrong at high energies, requiring entirely new principles. However, a\nstronger argument against the impossibility hybrids is provided by\nJames Mattingly, who points out that since there are satisfiable\naxioms for semiclassical theories, inconsistency cannot be established\nin general (2009, p. 381).\n6. Conclusion\n\nResearch on quantum gravity is beset by a combination of formal,\nexperimental, and conceptual difficulties. It is inevitable that the\nquest for a quantum theory of gravity will continue \u2013 whether\nfor reasons of necessity or not \u2013 and it seems that the\nresolution of the problem will require an equivalent combination of\nformal, experimental, and conceptual expertise. Given this, and given\nthe central position quantum gravity research occupies in theoretical\nphysics, it makes good sense for philosophers of physics (and general\nphilosophers of science) to do their best to acquaint themselves with\nthe central details of the problem of quantum gravity and the main\napproaches that are seeking to crack the problem. Beyond this, quantum\ngravity research has the potential to invigorate several standard\nareas of philosophical inquiry, including our standard notions of\ntheory construction, selection and justification; the nature of space,\ntime, matter, and causality, and it also introduces a new case study\nin emergence, with entirely novel features.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ashtekar, A. and R.
