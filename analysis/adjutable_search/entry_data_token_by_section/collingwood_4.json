    "main_text": "Metaphilosophy || The ontological argument and the correspondence with Ryle\n2.4 The ontological argument and the correspondence with Ryle\n\nThe question concerning the relation between Collingwood\u2019s two\nmetaphilosophical treatises and whether the conception of the role of\nphilosophical analysis articulated in An Essay on Metaphysics\nis continuous with that described in An Essay on Philosophical\nMethod is further complicated by the fact that An Essay on\nPhilosophical Method contains a defence of the ontological\nargument that appears to be at odds with Collingwood\u2019s later\nclaim that metaphysics is a logical, not an ontological inquiry and\nwith the assertion that presuppositional analysis is a form of\n\u201cmetaphysics without ontology\u201d. The ontological proof is\nnormally regarded as the pinnacle of metaphysical knowledge, knowledge\nthat is both necessary (as a priori knowledge) and has existential\nimport (as empirical knowledge). Collingwood\u2019s allegiance to the\nontological proof in An Essay on Philosophical Method would\ntherefore seem to provide further evidence for the hypothesis of a\nrift between Collingwood\u2019s earlier and later conception of\nphilosophical analysis because it seems to be advancing the sort of\nrobust metaphysical claims which Collingwood\u2019s later conception\nof metaphysics is keen to leave behind. However, the detail of\nCollingwood\u2019s discussion of the ontological proof suggests that\nhe had a rather unorthodox understanding of what the ontological proof\nestablishes (D\u2019Oro 2002). Paradoxical as this might sound, he\ndid not seem to think that the ontological proof establishes any\nsubstantive ontological conclusions and that it yields the sort of\nmetaphysical knowledge he later explicitly claimed to be impossible.\nHis concern with the ontological proof was intricately connected with\nan attempt to delineate the subject matter of philosophical analysis,\nnot the existence of metaphysical entities. God, for Collingwood, is\n\u201cthat which we are thinking about when we are thinking\nphilosophically\u201d (Collingwood\u2019s 1935 private letter to\nRyle, published in the 2005 edition of An Essay on Philosophical\nMethod, EPM 2005: 257). This claim may be clarified by saying\nthat philosophical concepts are not contingently instantiated in an\nempirical class of objects (as we have seen, they do not sort things\ninto classes); they are necessarily instantiated in the forms of\njudgement or inference which they make possible. For example, the\nconcept of the good, qua expediency, is necessarily\ninstantiated in hypothetical or instrumental imperatives and the\nconcept of mind is necessarily instantiated in judgements which\nexplain actions qua expression of thought. This is the kernel\nof truth that, according to Collingwood, is worth restating in the\nontological argument.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s discussion of the ontological argument in An\nEssay on Philosophical Method gave rise to a lively epistolary\nexchange with Ryle (the exchange is published in the 2005 edition of\nAn Essay on Philosophical Method). The correspondence was\ntriggered by the publication of an article in Mind by Ryle\n(1935) which attacked Collingwood\u2019s sympathetic appraisal of the\nontological proof on the grounds that there are no such things as\npropositions which are both necessary and existential, i.e., no such\nthings as metaphysical propositions, like the one asserting the\nnecessary existence of God. Collingwood replied to Ryle in a private\nletter by claiming that that there is a third kind of proposition,\nphilosophical propositions, which feature philosophical concepts,\npropositions such as \u201cMind exists\u201d or \u201cMatter\nexists\u201d. Such propositions are necessary but not merely\nhypothetical because the philosophical concepts whose existence they\nassert are necessarily instantiated in the judgements employed by the\npractitioners of a given science. \u201cMind exists\u201d in so far\nas one explains actions by means of rationalisations, rather than\nnomological explanations; the concept of mind is embedded in the kind\nof judgement or inference that it makes possible. The main bone of\ncontention in the correspondence between Ryle and Collingwood was\ntherefore not the ontological argument in its traditional form, but\nwhether or not philosophy has an autonomous domain of inquiry, i.e.,\nwhether there are distinctive philosophical concepts, (concepts which\nallow for complete extensional overlap). As we have seen Collingwood\nlater revisited the claim that philosophy has an autonomous domain of\ninquiry in An Essay on Metaphysics, where he reformulated it\nby saying that philosophy is not an ontological but a logical enquiry\ninto the presuppositions which govern thought.\n\nIn spite of Collingwood\u2019s attempts to qualify his commitment to\nthe ontological argument Ryle continued to read Collingwood\u2019s\ndefence of the ontological proof at face value refusing to accept that\nthe ontological proof could properly be interpreted as anything other\nthan what it states on the label, i.e., an argument for the existence\nof God. Collingwood, for his part, insisted on illustrating what the\nsubject matter of philosophy is, by defending a highly controversial\ninterpretation of what the ontological proof establishes. Be this as\nit may, the misunderstandings between Collingwood and Ryle show how\nvery difficult it must have been for Collingwood to translate his\ninsights in the language of the burgeoning school of analytic\nphilosophy. In spite of the misunderstandings it involves, the\nCollingwood-Ryle correspondence reveals some of the issues which truly\ntroubled philosophers in the first half of the twentieth century and\noffers a fascinating window onto the origins of analytic philosophy\n(D\u2019Oro 2000; Vrijen 2006).\n",
