    "preamble": "\n\nEmily Elizabeth Constance Jones (1848\u20131922), a contemporary of\nBertrand Russell and G. E. Moore at Cambridge University, worked\nprimarily in philosophical logic and ethics. Her most significant\ncontribution to the former area is her application of the\nintension-extension distinction to singular terms, anticipating\nFrege\u2019s related distinction between sense and reference and\nRussell\u2019s pre-\u201cOn Denoting\u201d distinction between\nmeaning and denotation. Widely regarded as an authority on\nphilosophical logic by figures as diverse as F. C. S. Schiller and G.\nF. Stout on the one hand and C. S. Peirce on the other, Jones appeared\nin published symposia alongside such eminent contemporaries as W. E.\nJohnson and Bernard Bosanquet and became, in 1896, the first woman to\npresent a paper at the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club. Her major\npublication, A New Law of Thought and its Logical Bearings,\npublished in 1911 by Cambridge University Press, contained an\nenthusiastic preface by Stout and was received favorably in\nMind, where the reviewer, Schiller, remarked: \u201cMiss\nJones has made a great discovery.\u201d In the same year, Russell\ndelivered a paper to the Moral Sciences Club, subsequently published\nas \u201cKnowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by\nDescription\u201d, responding to a critical paper by Jones, delivered\nto the same society some months earlier. In ethics, Jones was well\nknown as a defender and expositor of the views of her teacher and\nmentor, Henry Sidgwick. (Sidgwick regarded Jones as one of his prize\nstudents.) Yet, despite the fact that she published numerous articles,\na monograph and several textbooks (some going into multiple editions),\nand was a very visible member of the English philosophical community\nfrom the 1890s until her death in 1922, she is now almost entirely\nforgotten.\n\nFollowing a biographical sketch (section 1), sections 2\u20136 focus on\nJones\u2019s work in philosophical logic\u2014in particular, her law\nof significant assertion and her criticisms of Russell; section 7 is\ndevoted to Jones\u2019s contributions to ethical theory.

    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nBorn in Wales in 1848, Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones matriculated at\nGirton College, Cambridge University\u2019s newly established\nwomen\u2019s college, in 1875. She studied for the Moral Sciences\nTripos under Henry Sidgwick, James Ward and John Neville Keynes,\nreceiving a \u201cFirst Class\u201d, Sidgwick being among her\nexaminers. (Her brothers\u2019 education took priority over her own,\ndelaying her entry into the academy and occasioning subsequent\ninterruptions.) It was due to the interventions of Sidgwick and Ward\nthat Jones, fluent from childhood in both German and French, was\noffered to complete, upon graduation, the remaining half of a\ntranslation of Hermann Lotze\u2019s massive Mikrocosmos,\nleft unfinished by Elizabeth Hamilton (the recently deceased daughter\nof Sir William Hamilton). Jones later went on to become\nSidgwick\u2019s literary executor. Her research in philosophical\nlogic dates from 1884, when she began her career at Girton College as\nResident Lecturer in Moral Sciences and was called upon to teach\ncourses in logic; she later became Vice-Mistress and, subsequently,\nMistress of Girton. During this period, Jones wrote a number of\nintroductory logic texts, some of which went through several\nprintings. By 1890, in her Elements of Logic as a Science of\nPropositions, whose main philosophical themes are summarized in\n\u201cThe Import of Categorical Propositions\u201d (Jones 1893a),\nshe developed her \u201claw of significant assertion\u201d\u2014the\n\u201cnew law of thought\u201d which would become the focus of her\nsubsequent work in philosophical logic, culminating in the\neponymously-titled monograph, published by Cambridge University Press\nin 1911. During the same period Jones also published numerous papers,\nas well as an introductory text (Jones 1909), in ethics. While her\nwork in this area was primarily devoted to the exposition,\ninterpretation and defense of Sidgwick\u2019s work, she arguably broke\nnew ground in her attempt at resolving Sidgwick\u2019s dualism of\npractical reason. Jones was also a capable administrator. When she\nbecame Mistress of Girton in 1903, the college was \u00a343,000 in\ndebt (equivalent to \u00a35,185,069 in 2020); at the time of her\nretirement in 1916, the debt had been paid off and funds had been\nraised to finance several fellowships. Her death in 1922 was marked by\nthe appearance of substantial obituaries in Mind,\nProceedings of the Aristotelian Society and The\nInternational Journal of Ethics (now Ethics).\n2. A New Law of Thought\n2.1 The Paradox of Predication\n\nIn her autobiography, Jones wrote of an early fascination with issues\nrelated to the nature and structure of content:\n\nThis unsettled question\u2014what is asserted when you make a\nstatement, and what is the proper form of statement?\u2014had\ndeeply interested me from the time when I was a student and puzzled\nover Mill\u2019s and Jevons\u2019 accounts of propositions. (Jones\n1922: 71)\n\n\nPart of what fascinated her concerned (what I\u2019ll call) the\nparadox of predication\u2014a paradox that Jones traced to\nPlato\u2019s Sophist. To understand Jones\u2019s main\ncontributions to philosophical logic, it is useful to review Hermann\nLotze\u2019s influential discussion, well known to Jones, of this\nparadox:\n\nThis absolute connection of two concepts S and P, in\nwhich the one is unconditionally the other, and yet both stand over\nagainst each other as different, is a relation quite impracticable in\nthought; by means of this copula, the simple \u2018is\u2019 of the\ncategorical judgment, two different contents cannot be connected at\nall; they must either fall entirely within one another, or they must\nremain entirely separate, and the impossible judgment,\n\u2018S is P\u2019, resolves itself into three\nothers, \u2018S is S\u2019, \u2018P is\nP\u2019, \u2018S is not P.\u2019 (Lotze\n1888, 79)\n\n\nTo predicate P of S is either to say of S\nwhat it is not, or it is to say of S what it is. That is, it\nis to say that S is not S (because it is\nP), or it is to say that it is S. We either get a\ncontradiction\u2014we say, in effect, that S is not\nS\u2014or an instance of the law of identity\u2014we say\nthat S is S. Neither option is satisfactory.\n\nFor Lotze, the paradox has an immediate upshot: that the \u2018is\u2019 of\npredication be expunged from logic. Grammatical appearances\nnotwithstanding, the basic form an assertion takes is that of an\nidentity statement or of its negation. This, however, renders him\nincapable of making sense of (what Jones called) \u201csignificant\nassertion\u201d. The content of an assertion, if it is not to be an\nabsurdity (A is not A), must be a triviality\n(A is A). (Lotze vaguely hints at a pragmatic\naccount of the apparent significance of what he counts as\ntrivialities, remarking that, perhaps, \u201cwhat we mean by\nthem will eventually justify itself.\u201d) As we shall see, Jones\ndoes not depart from Lotze\u2019s austere conception of logical form:\nan affirmative proposition S is P states an identity, and is\ntrue just in case the extension of S = the extension of\nP. However, she is able to graft a notion of intensional\ncontent onto Lotze\u2019s logical skeleton, thus avoiding his\nparadoxical conclusion that, despite appearances, all positive\nassertion is analyzed in terms of A is not A.\n\nThe debate surrounding this paradox was not marginal, but at the\ncenter of contemporary discussion. Although Jones\u2019s own solution\nfalls squarely within the framework of nineteenth century logic, she\nseems to be responding to worries that were shared by Russell and\nMoore. Indeed, Dreben and Floyd (1991), who provide a useful\ndiscussion of the historical context, argue that the paradox is\nimplicated in Russell and Moore\u2019s break with idealism.\n2.2 Identity Propositions and Significant Assertion\n\nThe distinction between the intension (or connotation) and extension\n(or denotation) of names, which traces back to the\n Port Royal Logic,\n was widely acknowledged by nineteenth century logicians. But the\ndistinction was applied, as a rule, to general names, not\nproper names. With regard to proper names, logicians\ngenerally sided with John Stuart Mill in holding that they lack\nconnotation. Keynes, for example, writes that proper names are\n\u201cnon-connotative\u201d\u2014that is, \u201ctheir application\nis not determined by a conventionally assigned set of\nattributes\u201d (Keynes 1906, 42).\n\nJones\u2019s \u201cNew Law of Thought\u201d\u2014the law of\nsignificant assertion\u2014incorporates the distinction as\nfollows.\n\nThe Law of Significant Assertion:\n\nAny Subject of Predication is an identity of denotation in diversity\nof intension. (Jones 1910\u201311, 169; 1911b, 2)\n\n\nThe general idea is quite straightforward and will have a familiar\nring to anyone acquainted with Frege\u2019s sense-reference\ndistinction (or Russell\u2019s pre-\u201cOn Denoting\u201d\ndistinction between meaning and denotation), even if the formulation\nis slightly clumsy: when we predicate a property of an individual or\ncollection x, we first identify x via an intension\nf and then assert its identity with an individual or\ncollection y, where y is itself identified via a\ndistinct intension, g. We thus combine \u201cidentity of\ndenotation\u201d or \u201cdenotational oneness\u201d with\n\u201cdiversity of intension\u201d. As she puts it as early as 1893,\n\u201cthe very essence of Categorical statements\u2026 is the\nreference (in affirmatives) of two terms to one object, in such a way\nas to indicate that the object (or group) pointed out by the one term\nhas also the characteristics signified by the other\u2026\u201d\n(1893a, 219). Or, as Stout writes in his Preface to Jones (1911b),\n\u201cevery affirmative proposition asserts, and every negative\nproposition denies, the union of different attributes within the unity\nof the same thing\u201d (Stout 1911, v).\n\nAs noted, Jones\u2019s conception of logical form is austere: every\npositive proposition asserts an identity. Accordingly, she takes the\nterms of all F is G to be the quantifier phrase all\nF and the predicate G. (\u201cI understand the\nterms to include the whole of any proposition except\nthe copula\u201d [1893\u201394, 36].) This departs from the\nthen-standard view, which distinguishes, in addition to the copula,\nsubject term (F), predicate term (G) and quantifier\nor \u201cterm indicator\u201d (all). The quantifier, she\nalso notes, is optional, citing \u2018Cicero is Tully\u2019 as a\ncase of an identity proposition in which it is absent (1890, 5).\n\nThere are thus only two forms that can properly be referred to as\nlogical forms for Jones\u2014identities and their negations.\nWhile Jones holds that S is P asserts an \u201cidentity of\ndenotation\u201d in \u201cdiversity of intension\u201d, S\nis not P asserts \u201cdifference of denotation\u201d in\n\u201cintensional diversity\u201d. (Even if one accepts the former\nanalysis, however, the latter is problematic. As Augusta Klein (1911)\nnotes, for a statement of the form S is not P to be\ninformative, more is required than the mere \u201cintensional\ndiversity\u201d of S and P. To see this note that,\nwhile \u2018Horses are not house plants\u2019 gives us a case of\n\u201cdifference of denotation\u201d in \u201cintensional diversity\u201d, it is\nno more informative than \u2018Horses are horses.\u2019 For Klein,\nthe intensions must overlap to a significant degree for the claim of\ntheir diversity to have any cognitive value.)\n\nJones thus solves a problem that must be faced by anyone espousing the\nview that predication is, at root, identity. If assertively uttering a\nsentence exemplifying \u2018S is P\u2019 is\nconstrued as asserting a proposition that A is\nA, then we fail to capture the point of the assertion. The\nassertion appears significant and informative; yet the content is\ntrifling\u2014something about which we can hardly be\n\u201cinformed\u201d. If we take the general form of assertion to be\nan informative identity\u2014to be \u201can identity of denotation\nin diversity of intension\u201d\u2014then the problem disappears.\nThe solution, of course, applies to the cases that interested\nFrege\u2014sentences that are explicitly of the form A =\nA. Indeed, Jones\u2019s proposal here is in rough outline that\nof Frege (1892). (See the entry on\n Frege\u2014in\n particular, the section\n Frege\u2019s Philosophy of Language.)\n \n\nIt is worth remarking, however, that Jones\u2019s label \u201ca new\nlaw of thought\u201d is somewhat misleading. In the nineteenth\ncentury, the laws of thought were commonly understood to be the\nfollowing: the law of identity, the law of\nnon-contradiction, and the law of excluded middle. These\nare all easily statable in a first-order language. But Jones does not\nstate a new firs-order law, in addition to these three; nor does she\nexplain how the new \u201claw\u201d can supplant the law of\nidentity. \n\nWhat then is the status of her law, vis-\u00e0-vis the\nother laws? The following passage provides some help:\n\nIf we genuinely accept A is A as the expression of a\nfundamental and primary logical principle, the difficulty is, how\ntheoretically to get beyond it. If we reject it, what we need, and\nwhat we find, to put in its place, is a principle of significant\nassertion of the form S is P. The laws of\ncontradiction and excluded middle are laws of the relations of\nassertions, and they cannot be expressed in satisfactory and\nunambiguous form without the use of S is P,\nS is not P, propositions. So even for them we\nrequire a prior principle, explaining and justifying the S is\nP proposition itself. Such a logical principle, based on\na new analysis of S is P, I think I can provide.\n(1911b, 10\u201311; emphasis added)\n\n\nFor Jones, the laws of contradiction and excluded middle apply\nexclusively to contentful assertions. Jones\u2019s worry is that the\nconception of content inherited from Lotze, on which S is P\nis, effectively, A is A, is a poor model not only for\nordinary assertions, but also of instances of the laws of\ncontradiction and excluded middle. These laws tell us, respectively,\nthat it cannot be the case, for example, both that Socrates\nis mortal and that he is not, and that it must be the case that\neither Socrates is mortal or he is not. In short, they tell\nus, of a significant assertion \u03a6, that either \u03a6 or its\nnegation obtains, and that \u03a6 and its negation cannot both obtain.\n\n\nAlthough Jones calls her law a \u201cprior principle\u201d, this\ndoes not mean that she takes her law to be logically prior to\nthe other laws. These other laws provide us with logical forms that\ncannot have false instances. Jones\u2019s law does something else: it\nplaces a constraint on significant assertion, whether true or false,\ntelling us what conditions an assertion has to meet for it to be a\nsignificant instance, not only of identity, but also of contradiction\nand excluded middle. \n2.3 Observations on Intension and Extension\n\nAlthough the concept of intension plays an important role in\nJones\u2019s theory, she recognizes that grasping the intension of a\nname is neither necessary nor sufficient for grasping its extension.\nOne may grasp the intension of a term and not grasp its extension, or\nconversely, grasp its extension but not its intension. Although\nundeveloped, her observations here are remarkably prescient.\n\nConcerning the possibility that grasping an expression\u2019s\nextension does not require grasping its intension, she writes:\n\n\nI know that metal in extension denotes gold, silver, copper,\niron, lead, tin, mercury, aluminium, etc., and I know these when I see\nthem, but I am not able to give a satisfactory statement of the\nintension which they have in common\u2026\n\nOr again I know, or I may know, all the inhabitants of a country\nparish and be able to greet them correctly by name when I meet them,\nbut may be entirely unable to give a recognizable description of any\nof them. Or I may know real diamonds from paste, or one disease from\nanother, and always apply the names rightly, and yet be unable to set\nout even to myself the connotation or intension. (1911b, 13)\n\n\nThe point applies to the intensions of proper names as well as natural\nkind terms. What these considerations suggest, as similar\nconsiderations later suggested to Gareth Evans (1982), Saul Kripke\n(1980) and Hilary Putnam (1975), is that names and natural kind terms\ndo not pick out their referents descriptively: mastery of either\nproper names or natural kind terms does not require that we associate\nwith them any reference-determining description. Jones, however,\ndoesn\u2019t draw this bold conclusion. In fact, she thinks the\nobservation is harmless, since, on her view, the intension of a term\ncan be reconstructed by reflecting on its extension:\n\nWhat I insist on is that all the names we use have both extension and\nintension; and either of these may be a guide to the other. I may have\nthe things to which a name applies put before me\u2026 and from\nexamination of them reach the intension; or have intension given, and\ngo out and by means of it determine extension. (1911b, 14)\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear, however, that Jones is committing herself to\nany strong thesis here\u2014that, contra Russell, there is a\n\u201cbackward road\u201d from referent to sense; only that, in\npractice, a term\u2019s intension can often be gleaned from\nexamination of its extension.\n\nIn addition, grasping a term\u2019s intension does not guarantee\nbeing able to identify its extension:\n\nOn the other hand I may have full descriptive knowledge of a person or\nplant or precious stone, and yet not be able to recognize the person\nor plant or jewel though it may much concern me to do so. I may even\nknow much more about a person than his ordinary acquaintances, or even\nthan his dearest friend, and be able to give a much more accurate\ndescription of his appearance and manner, and yet not know him when I\nmeet him. (1911b, 13\u20134)\n\n\nTo connect this observation with the previous, we must assume that the\ncompetent use of N, where N is a name or natural\nkind term, involves a capacity to recognize N\u2019s\nreferent. What this passage then shows is that this recognitional\ncapacity is not grounded in our grasping any reference-securing\ndescription or intension. But then grasping a name\u2019s intension\ndoes not, by itself, put one in a position to use it to refer.\n\nOf course, the points are, as indicated, undeveloped, and the above\ninterpretation, written in the light of later discussions by Kripke,\nPutnam and Gareth Evans, may put more weight on Jones\u2019s remarks\nthan they can plausibly bear. But the passage\u2019s placement early\non in the monograph reflects an awareness of its significance. (The\npassage does, of course, fail to register the thought that her\nobservations could undermine a key aspect of her proposal\u2014that\nnames and natural kind terms have intensions, or sense.)\n2.4 Applying the Analysis\n\nAs we have seen, Jones holds that all affirmative propositions are\nidentities. Applying the analysis can be less than straightforward,\nhowever. Consider her analysis of (1):\n\n(1)\n This small fragrant wild flower is Clematis.\n\n\nOn her view, \u2018this small fragrant wild flower\u2019 and\n\u2018Clematis\u2019 have the same extension, yet they possess\ndistinct intensions (Jones 1893\u201394, 36). Jones doesn\u2019t\nfully work out the details of this proposal, but the idea seems to be\nthat the extension of the subject term is identical to some\nClematis\u2014a subset of the things in the extension of\n\u2018Clematis\u2019.\n\nAs can be seen, the analysis assumes that predicate terms are\nimplicitly quantified. Jones held, following William Hamilton, that\nquantification is not restricted to subject terms, but applies to\npredicate terms as well (although the quantifier attaching to the\npredicate is never articulated). While Hamilton\u2019s doctrine of\nthe quantification of the predicate allowed for all sorts of\nmonstrosities (Kneale and Kneale, 1962, 352\u20134), the only cases\nthat Jones discusses involve quantifying the predicate with\n\u2018some\u2019, and assigning truth conditions to\n\u2018Q + S are some P\u2019 is\nrelatively straightforward:\n\n\nAll \\(S\\) is some \\(P\\)\n \\(|S - P^*| = 0\\)\nwhere\n\\(P^* \\subseteq P\\)\n\nSome \\(S\\) is some \\(P\\)\n\\(|S^* \\cap P^*| \\gt 0\\)\nwhere\n\\(S^* \\subseteq S\\) and \\(P^* \\subseteq P\\)\n\n\nIn each case, we get precisely the truth conditions we would have with\na quantifier-free predicate. E.g., \u2018All S is some\nP\u2019 is true just in case all S are\nP.\n\nThe endorsement of Hamilton\u2019s view might seem\nperverse\u2014and, in fact, Jones is elsewhere critical of his view\n(1906, 35\u20136)\u2014but it is necessary if Jones is to retain the\nview that significant assertion is, at root, the assertion of an\nidentity. After all, if \u2018All humans are mortal\u2019 asserts an\nidentity, then, given that identity is commutative, it entails the\napparently nonsensical \u2018Mortals are all humans.\u2019 The\nresult is at least intelligible if we suppose that the predicate is\nalso quantified\u2014if, that is, \u2018All humans are mortal\u2019\nis just \u2018All humans are some mortals.\u2019 For then, the\nconsequence would be \u2018Some mortals are all humans,\u2019 which\nis just the claim that some subset of the set of mortals is identical\nto the set of (all) humans. (This, of course, is not quite an identity\nstatement, since one of the terms is quantified, but it is the closest\nwe can get to a workable version of Jones\u2019s proposal.)\n\nHamilton\u2019s doctrine provides a straightforward explanation of\nthe validity of conversion. Indeed, Jones go so far as to claim that\nconversion itself presupposes some such approach: \u201cThe\npossibility of conversion\u2026 implies that the predicate, as well\nas the subject, of any proposition has denotation, and a denotation\nthat is implicitly quantified\u201d (1911b, 3; see also Jones, et al.\n1914\u201315, 364). To be clear, Jones has a non-standard conception of\nconversion, on which the converse of \u2018All humans are\nmortals\u2019 is \u2018Some mortals are humans\u2019 and not, as\nusually understood, \u2018All mortals are humans\u2019 (she follows\nKeynes 1906, \u00a796). Jones takes the former, fully articulated, to be\n\u2018All humans are some mortals.\u2019 Conversion switches the\npositions of the subject and predicate terms, giving us \u2018Some\nmortals are all humans\u2019. Of course, since the original and its\nconverse are both, at logical form, identity statements, this is just\nan instance of the commutativity of identity (Keynes 1906, \u00a7142).\n\n\nThe analysis is applied to a variety of statement forms (see 1911b,\n48\u201353). One cannot escape the impression, however, that Jones,\nlike the Oxbridge logicians generally, \u201cdissected with some\ncrude instruments\u201d (Grattan-Guinness 1985\u201386, 113). Indeed, as\nW. E. Johnson objected in an early exchange with Jones, the analysis\nseems to presuppose the very notion it seeks to\neliminate\u2014predication (Johnson 1892, 23). Consider (2):\n\n(2)\n Socrates is mortal.\n On Jones\u2019s analysis, (2)\u2019s logical form is given by\n\u2018Socrates is identical to some mortal.\u2019 Using contemporary\nnotation, this becomes (3) (recall that, for Jones, some\nmortal refers to a class):\n\n\n(3)\n\\(\\exists y (y\\in \\{x | \\textit{Mortal}(x)\\}\\amp \\textit{Socrates}=y)\\)\n\nAs Johnson notes, in thus specifying the set of mortals (\u2018the\nset of things x such that x is a mortal\u2019), we are invoking the\nrelation of predication\u2014the very notion that Lotze, and by\nimplication Jones, rejected as\n unintelligible.[1]\n (Jones responds in Jones 1893a.)\n\nStill, while the Law of Significant Assertion cannot be true in its\nfull generality, a restriction of the law to identity sentences is\nworth considering. Accordingly, in discussing Jones in relation to\nFrege and Russell, I will construe The Law of Significant Assertion as\na doctrine concerning identity sentences\u2014sentences of the form\na is b (where a and b are names,\ndemonstratives or descriptions and is functions accordingly\nas the is of identity, not predication)\u2014and not as a\nclaim about subject-predicate sentences generally.\n3. Comparison with Frege and Russell\n\nJones\u2019s analysis of identity sentences has obvious affinities\nwith similar analyses advanced by Frege and the early Russell. In\nlight of this, it is instructive to review how Frege and Russell argue\nfor their respective analyses and compare their arguments with\nJones\u2019s own.\n3.1 Comparison with Frege\n\nIn the opening paragraph of \u201cOn Sense and Reference\u201d\n(Frege 1892), Frege argues that a theory that identifies the semantic\nvalue of a name with its referent\u2014the na\u00efve\ntheory\u2014cannot differentiate between the contents of\n\u2018Hesperus = Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Hesperus =\nPhosphorus\u2019. Given the plausible assumption that the proposition\nexpressed by a sentence is a function of the semantic values of its\nconstituent expressions together with their mode of combination, it\nseems inevitable that what the latter sentence says is just what the\nformer sentence says\u2014assuming, with the na\u00efve theory, that\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 possess the same\nsemantic value. Of course, the latter sentence is potentially\ninformative, whereas the former sentence is not. This leads Frege to\nreject the na\u00efve theory. He also rejects, for reasons that need\nnot detain us, a view according to which identity is a relation\nbetween the names \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019. The view he settles on is that the\ncontribution that \u2018Hesperus\u2019 makes to the propositions\nexpressed by the above-quoted identity sentences is a sense\n\u2014a way of thinking of the referent. (While one might say that\nthe semantic value of \u2018Hesperus\u2019 is the\nassociated sense, this would be incorrect, since, on Frege\u2019s\nview, \u2018Hesperus\u2019 has two semantic values\u2014its sense,\nand the referent determined by this sense. The proposition expressed\nby, e.g., \u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 is partly determined by\nthis sense, whereas the referent of this sentence\u2014for Frege, its\ntruth-value\u2014is partly determined by the associated\nreferent.)\n\nJones\u2019s argument is similar, but not identical, to\nFrege\u2019s. She argues that a theory that assimilates all assertion\nto A is A must fail to account for cases of\nsignificant assertion\u2014cases in which we go beyond \u201cpure\ntautology\u201d. Frege\u2019s argument is more sophisticated, making\nimplicit appeal to a principle of compositionality, and considering\nalternative theories of the semantic contents of singular terms.\nStill, both are concerned to correct a similar\u2014perhaps the\nsame\u2014mistake. Indeed, Jones\u2019s and Frege\u2019s interest\nin identity may derive from a common source, namely Lotze. (See\nGabriel 2002 and Heis 2013 for assessments of Lotze\u2019s role in the\ndevelopment of Frege\u2019s thought.)\n3.2 Comparison with Russell\n\nRussell\u2019s analysis of identity sentences in Principles\n\u00a764 falls out of his theory of denoting concepts\u2014concepts\nthat, like intensions, determine an extension. In this section Russell\nshows how the theory of denoting concepts can explain \u201cwhy it is\never worthwhile to affirm identity\u201d:\n\nBut the question arises: Why is it ever worth while to affirm\nidentity? The question is answered by the theory of denoting. If we\nsay \u201cEdward VII is the King,\u201d we assert an identity; the\nreason why this assertion is worth making is, that in the one case the\nactual term occurs, while in the other a denoting concept takes its\nplace\u2026 Often two denoting concepts occur, and the term itself\nis not mentioned, as in the proposition \u201cthe present Pope is the\nlast survivor of his generation.\u201d When a term is given, the\nassertion of an identity with itself, though true, is perfectly\nfutile, and is never made outside the logic-books; but where denoting\nconcepts are introduced, identity is at once seen to be significant.\nIn this case, of course, there is involved, though not asserted, a\nrelation of the denoting concept to the terms, or of the two denoting\nconcepts to each other. But the is which occurs in such\npropositions does not itself state this further relation, but states\npure identity. (Russell 1903; note omitted)\n\n\nThis bears a striking similarity to Jones\u2019s proposal. When an\nidentity statement relates two \u201cterms\u201d, or individuals, it\nis trivial and \u201cis never made outside the logic-books\u201d;\nbut when at least one denoting concept is involved, the statement is\nsignificant. While these cases \u201cinvolve\u201d a relation of\nco-reference between the denoting concepts, or between one denoting\nconcept and the term denoted, this relation is not part of what is\nstated: the one relation stated remains \u201cpure identity\u201d.\nThus, even in the case of an identity statement involving a denoting\nconcept, such as \u2018the present Pope is the last survivor of his\ngeneration,\u2019 we nonetheless assert an identity involving the\nindividual determined by the denoting concept.\n\nIn \u201cThe Existential Import of Propositions\u201d (Russell\n1905a), the theory of denoting concepts is applied to the problem of\nvacuous singular terms. Russell explains how the failure of a singular\nterm to denote is compatible with the term\u2019s nonetheless having\nmeaning, if we assume that denoting phrases (such as \u2018the\npresent King of France\u2019) and at least certain names\n(\u2018Apollo\u2019) express denoting concepts. Jones seems not to\nhave considered the application of her denotation-connotation\ndistinction to the problem of vacuous terms and does not appeal to its\nutility in this connection in arguing for her proposal.\n4. Russell\u2019s Recognition of Jones\n\nAs we have seen, Jones\u2019s and Russell\u2019s respective analyses\nof identity statements are similar and, moreover, similarly motivated.\nThis raises a question: did Russell, prior to their public exchange\n(discussed below), have any awareness of Jones\u2019s work? Complete\nignorance on Russell\u2019s part seems unlikely, considering that her\nteacher, Ward, and her champion, Stout, were Russell\u2019s teachers\nat\n Cambridge.[2]\n It seems plausible that they would have attempted to interest Russell\nin the work of someone whose concerns overlapped with his so\nsignificantly. Moreover, Russell was a regular reader of the journals\nto which Jones contributed; in several cases, the two appeared in the\nsame issue of Mind or of the Proceedings of the\nAristotelian Society. (In fact, Jones\u2019s contribution to\nThe Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society for\n1906\u201307, which occurs in the same issue as Russell\u2019s\n\u201cOn the Nature of Truth\u201d, is in part a commentary on\nRussell\u2019s paper.) But then we have another question\u2014why\ndoes he never cite her distinction? Surely his audience, in particular\nreaders of Mind, members of the Aristotelian Society and\nmembers of the Moral Sciences Club (see below), could be expected to\nbe acquainted with it. If so, then it would make sense to mention it,\nif only to show how his (or Frege\u2019s) version of the distinction\nis markedly different. Even if there is disagreement with the\nframework in which the distinction is grounded, Russell\u2019s total\nsilence demands an explanation. After all, in \u201cOn\nDenoting\u201d Russell cites approvingly Bradley\u2019s account of\nuniversal generalizations in terms of conditionals, even though he has\ndecisively parted ways with Bradley\u2019s logic. So he was clearly\ncapable of separating a valuable idea from the framework in which it\nis expressed.\n\nOne document of interest concerning the question of influence is a\nletter to Philip Jourdain, dated September 5, 1909. Jourdain had sent\nRussell the draft of a long survey article on Frege\u2019s work, in\nwhich he mentions Jones\u2019s distinction, in Jones (1890) and\n(1982a), between intension and denotation\u2014a distinction\nendorsed, as he noted in the published version of the article, by\nKeynes in the fourth (and final) edition of his influential text,\nStudies and Exercises in Formal Logic (Jourdain,\n1911\u201312, 201\u20132, footnote 153). Although Jourdain\u2019s\nletter is now lost, it appears he is querying Russell about the\nrelation between Jones\u2019s distinction and Frege\u2019s (and,\nquite possibly, Russell\u2019s related distinction between meaning\nand denotation). Here Russell responds:\n\nIt would seem, from what you say in your letter, that Miss\nJones\u2019s distinction of signification and denotation must be much\nthe same as Frege\u2019s Sinn and Bedeutung. But of course\nsome such distinction is a commonplace of logic, and\neverything turns on the form given to the distinction. I have neither\nKeynes nor Miss Jones here, or I would look up the point.\n(Grattan-Guinness 1977, 119)\n\n\nThe note displays a remarkable lack of charity. Russell, instead of\nexpressing interest in the possibility that Jones anticipated Frege on\nsense and reference, dismisses the distinction as \u201ca commonplace\nof logic.\u201d Going by what he writes here, how it is\nmade, and not the distinction itself, is what is crucial. But until\nRussell developed the theory of descriptions, the distinction was made\ninformally, both in his own case and in the case of Frege (1892).\n(While Frege 1893, \u00a711, does present a formal theory of definite\ndescriptions, one which could conceivably be employed as a formal\ntheory of sense, it is doubtful that Russell had this version of\nFrege\u2019s theory in mind when writing the above.) Surely the\ndistinction had been worth making in the cases of Frege and of his\nearlier self, even though no particular form seems to have been given\nto the distinction in either case. Russell\u2019s dismissal is\ntherefore puzzling.\n\nMoreover, had Russell consulted Keynes\u2019 account of Jones\u2019s\ndistinction, he would have encountered an example that is quite\nsimilar to one used by Frege in the opening paragraph of \u201cOn\nSense and Reference\u201d:\n\nIf out of all triangles we select those which possess the property of\nhaving three equal sides, and if again out of all triangles we select\nthose which possess the property of having three equal angles, we\nshall find that in either case we are left with precisely the same set\nof triangles. Thus, each side of our equation denotes precisely the\nsame class of objects, but the class is determined or arrived at in\ntwo different ways. (Keynes 1906, 190)\n\n\nWhether or not Keynes and Frege give the same \u201cform\u201d to\nthe distinction, Keynes\u2019s presentation is sufficiently close to\nFrege\u2019s to suggest that one could hardly be in a position to\ndismiss the one, but not the other, as\n \u201ccommonplace\u201d.[3]\n\nOne explanation of Russell\u2019s dismissal of Jones\u2019s\ndistinction has to do with his correspondent. Jourdain, a former\nstudent of Russell\u2019s, was quite conversant with the developing\nmathematical logic (at least to a degree\u2014he was a competent, but\nnot quite first-rate, practitioner), went on to publish informed\nsurvey articles on (in addition to the piece on Frege already\nmentioned) Boole, Jevons, MacColl, and Peano, and had written on\nRussell\u2019s earlier work on the principles of mathematics.\nIt\u2019s conceivable that Russell resented the fact that Jourdain,\nexpert in both Oxbridge logic and mathematical logic, took Jones to be\ntouching on a point that he and Frege had already laid claim\nto\u2014perhaps even beating them to a crucial insight. Matters are\nmade worse by the suggestion that Jones had\u2014however casually and\nindirectly\u2014influenced Russell. Any indication either that he was\ninfluenced by Jones, or that she anticipated him in some small way,\nwould detract from Russell\u2019s own contribution. It is one thing\nto acknowledge a debt to a Frege or to a Peano. Russell saw these men\nnot only as intellectual giants, but also as introducing genuinely\nrevolutionary ideas and techniques into the study of logic and the\nfoundations of mathematics. Not only was Jones manifestly not\nof their caliber, she was also philosophically quite retrograde. For\nRussell, mindful both of the figures he was allying himself with and\nof the innovation in thought that they were introducing, acknowledging\nthat Jones had anticipated some of his ideas may have been repugnant.\nSmall wonder, then, that he kept silent on the matter in his published\nwork and correspondence. As it turns out, Jones was quickly\nto take credit (in print) for first giving expression to the\ndistinction (see Jones 1910\u201311), although she sensibly refrained\nfrom suggesting that her work influenced Russell.\n\nNone of this is to deny that there may have been entirely intellectual\nreasons for Russell\u2019s dismissal. As indicated, Russell clearly\nsaw Jones as a throwback to an earlier period. Thus, even if there was\nsome recognition that she had come upon a distinction quite similar to\nthat between sense and reference or meaning and denotation,\nRussell\u2019s indifference could quite easily be attributed to the\nfact that the insight was grafted onto a system of logic that he\n rejected.[4]\n\nSee Waithe and Cicero (1995, 37\u201343) for an extended discussion\nof the relation between Russell and Jones. \n5. The Exchange\n\nOn December 2, 1910, Jones delivered a paper to the Cambridge Moral\nSciences Club, titled \u201cCategorical Propositions and the Law of\nIdentity\u201d (later published, under a different title, as Jones\n1911a). Russell responded at a meeting three months later, on March\n10, 1911, delivering \u201cKnowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by\nDescription\u201d. While Russell did not acknowledge being influenced\nby Jones in his earlier work, nor did he compare her view to\nFrege\u2019s, it is significant that he took her work seriously\nenough to merit a public response, one that would be recorded in one\nof his most influential papers.\n\nThe main point of their exchange concerns the following well-known\npassage in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d:\n\nIf a is identical with b, whatever is true of one is\ntrue of the other, and either may be substituted for the other in any\nproposition without altering the truth or falsehood of that\nproposition. Now George IV wished to know whether Scott was the author\nof Waverley; and in fact Scott was the author of\nWaverley. Hence, we may substitute Scott for the\nauthor of \u2018Waverley\u2019, and thereby prove that George\nIV wished to know whether Scott was Scott. Yet an interest in the law\nof identity can hardly be attributed to the first gentleman of Europe.\n(Russell 1905b, 420)\n\n\nOf this passage, Jones writes:\n\n\nWhen George IV asked whether Scott was the author of\nWaverley, what he wanted to know was, whether the intension\n(\u2018meaning\u2019, connotation) of Author of\n\u2018Waverley\u2019 could be assigned to\nScott\u2014i.e.,\u2014whether identity of denotation could\nbe asserted between Scott and Author of\n\u2018Waverley\u2019. The \u201cfirst gentleman of\nEurope\u201d did not want to know whether Scott was Scott \u2026\n.\n\nNo doubt, \u2018if a is identical [in denotation] with\nb,\u2019 whatever is true of the thing denoted by a\nis true of the same thing denoted by\nb\u2014with the obvious reservation that\na is a does not convey the information that a has\nthe intension (or connotation) b. (Jones 1910a, 379\u201380;\nthe insertion is Jones\u2019s) \n\n\nI quote Russell\u2019s response at length:\n\n\nMiss Jones argues that \u2018Scott is the Author of\nWaverley\u2019 asserts identity of denotation between\nScott and the author of Waverley. But there is some\ndifficulty in choosing among alternative meanings of this contention.\nIn the first place, it should be observed that the Author of\nWaverley is not a mere name, like Scott.\nScott is merely a noise, or shape conventionally used to\ndesignate a certain person; it gives no information about that person,\nand has nothing that can be called meaning as opposed to denotation.\n(I neglect the fact, considered above, that names, as a rule, really\nstand for descriptions.) But the author of Waverley is not\nmerely conventionally a name for Scott; the element of mere convention\nbelongs here to the separate words, the and author\nand of and Waverley. Given what these words stand\nfor, the author of Waverley is no longer arbitrary. When it\nis said that Scott is the author of Waverley, we are not\nstating that these are two names for one man, as we should be\nif we said \u2018Scott is Sir Walter\u2019. A man\u2019s name is\nwhat he is called, but however much Scott had been called the author\nof Waverley, that would not have made him be the author; it\nwas necessary for him to actually write Waverley, which was a\nfact having nothing to do with names. (Russell 1910\u201311,\n27\u201328) \n\n\nThis passage expands on a point made in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d,\nwhere Russell writes:\n\nNow the relation of meaning and denotation is not merely linguistic\nthrough the phrase: there must be a logical relation involved, which\nwe express by saying that the meaning denotes the denotation. (Russell\n1905b, 421)\n\n\nIn his response, Russell explains why it is that the relation between\na name and its referent is \u201cmerely linguistic through the\nphrase\u201d, whereas the relation between a description and its\ndenotation must be \u201clogical\u201d. The relation between a name\n\u00df and what it stands for is (merely) linguistic in that it is\nacceptable to specify what \u00df stands for with the phrase\n\u2018the referent/denotation of \u00df\u2019. The reason that it\nis acceptable is because \u00df has its reference or denotation\ndetermined conventionally. Thus, since no analysis is possible, all we\ncan do is state the brute fact captured by the schema \u2018\u00df\nstands for the referent/denotation of \u00df\u2019. In contrast, the\nrelation between a description and what it denotes is\nlogical\u2014the denotation relation is constrained by the\nmeanings of the constituents of the description and their mode of\ncombination. Thus, if \u00df is a description, \u2018\u00df stands\nfor the referent/denotation of \u00df\u2019 does not state a brute\nfact about our use of \u00df. Rather, it states a fact that holds in\nvirtue of other facts\u2014facts about the meanings of\n\u00df\u2019s constituents and their mode of combination.\n\nA bit later, he continues:\n\nIf we are to say, as Miss Jones does, that \u2018Scott is the author\nof Waverley\u2019 asserts an identity of denotation, we must\nregard the denotation of \u2018the author of Waverley\u2019\nas the denotation of what is meant by \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019. Let us call the meaning of \u2018the author\nof Waverley\u2019 M. Thus M is what\n\u2018the author of Waverley\u2019 means. Then we are to\nsuppose that \u2018Scott is the author of Waverley\u2019\nmeans \u2018Scott is the denotation of M\u2019. But here we\nare explaining our proposition by another of the same form, and thus\nhave made no progress towards a real explanation. \u2018The\ndenotation of M\u2019, like \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019\u00b8 has both meaning and denotation, on\nthe theory we are examining. If we call its meaning M\u2032,\nour proposition becomes \u2018Scott is the denotation of\nM\u2032\u2019. But this leads to an endless regress. Thus\nthe attempt to regard our proposition as asserting identity of\ndenotation breaks down, and it becomes imperative to find some other\nanalysis. When this analysis has been completed, we shall be able to\nreinterpret the phrase \u2018identity of denotation\u2019, which\nremains obscure so long as it is taken as fundamental. (Russell\n1910\u201311, 28\u201329)\n\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this. Russell is here evaluating a hypothesis\naccording to which a description such as \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019 is, contrary to his own view, meaningful in\n isolation.[5]\n To assume that this description is meaningful in isolation is to\nassume that, for some M, \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019 means M. Let\u2019s call this\nmeaning M*. Since we accept the following:\n\nThe denotation of \u2018the author of Waverley\u2019 = the\ndenotation of what is meant by \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019\n\n\nwe also accept\n\nThe denotation of \u2018the author of Waverley\u2019 = the\ndenotation of M*\n\n\nNow the meaning-in-isolation theorist might suggest that our original\nsentence, \u2018Scott is the author of Waverley\u2019,\nmeans that Scott is the denotation of M*. But, as Russell\nobserves, all this does is to replace one description with another.\nSince the theorist fails to tell us what \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019 means in terms that don\u2019t involve an\nexpression equally in need of analysis, we have been given no evidence\nthat this, or any, description is meaningful in isolation.\n\nJones responds:\n\nMr. Russell explains my meaning to be that the denotation of The\nauthor of Waverley is the denotation of what is meant by\nthe author of Waverley. But I do not accept this. Meaning,\nintension, of author is authorship; denotation of\nauthor is person of whom authorship is an attribute.\nI do not see from the fact of one proposition being explained by\nanother of the same form \u2026 it follows that we \u201chave made\nno progress towards a real explanation.\u201d This would seem to\ninvolve that one categorical proposition cannot be explained by other\ncategorical propositions. (Jones 1910\u201311, 183\u2013184)\n\n\nJones rejects the proposal that what is denoted by the F =\nwhat is denoted by the meaning of \u2018the F\u2019. While\nher reasoning is obscure, the point seems to be that these\ndescriptions cannot co-refer, since they involve different\nconcepts\u2014one, but not the other, involves the concept of\ndenotation. The point is confused, however; clearly, the descriptions\nare co-denoting\u2014relative to the assumption that \u2018the\nmeaning of the F\u2019 has a denotation.\n\nHer second point is more intriguing: Jones objects to the regress\nargument\u2019s conclusion that no real explanation of the\nmeaning of denoting phrases can be achieved if we explain a\nproposition containing such a phrase with another proposition\ncontaining a phrase of the same form. Once again, however, the point\nis undeveloped. Nonetheless, it is implied that a categorical\nproposition can indeed be explained by another categorical\nproposition, so from the fact that p and q share the\nsame form it does not follow that (e.g.) q fails to explain\np (in the relevant sense of \u2018explain\u2019). (Recall\nthat she takes all categorical propositions to possess the same form.)\nEchoing Jones\u2019s sentiment, R. M. Sainsbury writes, \u201cit is\nunclear what sort of explanation is needed, and why the circularity is\nvicious. This objection [i.e., Russell\u2019s] must be regarded as\ntherefore inconclusive\u201d (Sainsbury 1979, 105). (Broad (1912)\nresponds similarly.) Hylton (1990, 252\u201353), on the other hand,\nargues quite persuasively that there is a vicious regress\nhere (Hylton\u2019s remarks are concerned specifically with the\npassage in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d, however).\n\nThe point is developed further in Jones\u2019s reply to Broad (1912),\nresponding to Jones (1910\u201311):\n\n\nIf I say that the import of, e.g. Scott is the Author of\nWaverley, is to assert identity of denotation with diversity\nof intension, I can of course also say that: What is denoted by\n\u2018what is denoted by \u201cScott\u201d\u2019, is identical\nwith what is denoted by \u2018what is denoted by \u201cAuthor of\nWaverley\u201d\u2019. As Mr. Broad suggests, the repetition\nin Subject and Predicate is ineffective, and\n\n(1)\n Scott\n(2)\n What is denoted by \u2018Scott\u2019\n(3)\n What is denoted by \u2018What is denoted by\n\u201cScott\u201d\u2019\n\n\nhave all three the same identical denotation.\n\n(1\u2032)\n Scott is the Author of Waverley.\n\n\nIf my analysis (as far as denotation is concerned) is applied to this,\nwe get:\u2014\n\n(2\u2032)\n What is denoted by \u2018Scott\u2019 is identical with what is\ndenoted by \u2018Author of Waverley\u2019. \n\n\nIf the same analysis is applied to (2) we have :\u2014\n\n(3\u2032)\n What is denoted by \u2018What is denoted by\n\u201cScott\u201d\u2019 is identical with what is denoted by\n\u2018what is denoted by \u201cAuthor of\nWaverley\u201d\u2019, \n\n\nand so on. We have simply a repetition, for each successive more\ncomplicated proposition, of the analysis adopted.\n\nI think that a regress equally \u201cinfinite,\u201d equally\ninevitable, equally innocuous, equally useless, would emerge in the\ncase of any propositional analysis treated in the same way\u2026\n(Jones 1913, 528) \n\n\nJones seems to miss an important point here. The existence of a\nsequence such as (1\u2032)\u2013(3\u2032) is predicted on both\nanalyses\u2014one according to which \u2018Author of\nWaverley\u2019 (or \u2018the author of\nWaverley\u2019) has meaning in isolation, and one according\nto which it does not. Thus, the inevitability of the sequence is of no\nconsequence, as it fails to tell against Russell\u2019s theory.\n\nTo see this, note that Russell could easily acknowledge that a\nsequence of the following form will exist when\n\u2018a\u2019 is either a name or a definite\ndescription\n\na is the referent of \u2018a\u2019\n\na is the referent of \u201cthe referent of \u2018a\u2019\u201d\n\na is the referent of \u2018the referent of \u201cthe\nreferent of \u2018a\u2019\u201d\u2019\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\nIn the case of names, the first clause provides the ultimate\nexplanation for the truth of each succeeding clause. This is not true,\nhowever, when \u2018a\u2019 is a description.\n\nConsider, for example, the following segment of an infinite\nsequence:\n\n(4)\n Scott\n(5)\n the referent of \u2018Scott\u2019\n(6)\n the referent of \u2018the referent of\n\u201cScott\u201d\u2019\n\n\nWe can say that:\n\n(4*)\n \u2018Scott\u2019 refers to (4).\n(5*)\n \u2018Scott\u2019 refers to (5).\n(6*)\n \u2018Scott\u2019 refers to (6).\n\n\nNotice, however, that each member of the latter sequence\nafter (4*) holds because (4*) holds. (Unless, of\ncourse, one wants to deny that even \u2018Scott\u2019 has meaning in\nisolation; but this is obviously not Jones\u2019s position.) That is,\n\u2018Scott\u2019 refers to the referent of \u2018Scott\u2019\n(i.e., (5)) because \u2018Scott\u2019 refers to Scott (i.e.,\n(4)).\n\nNow consider the following initial segment of an infinite sequence,\n(7)\u2013(9), together with the corresponding reference assignments,\n(7*)\u2013(9*):\n\n(7)\n the author of Waverly \n(8)\n the referent of \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019\n(9)\n the referent of \u2018the referent of \u201cthe author of\nWaverly\u201d\u2019\n(7*)\n \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019 refers to (7)\n(8*)\n \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019 refers to (8)\n(9*)\n \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019 refers to (9)\n\n\nHere we see a contrast with (4*)\u2013(6*): to explain the fact\nreported by (8*) by citing the fact reported by (7*) is unsatisfying,\nsince (7*) is left unexplained. Moreover, (7*), unlike (4*), does not\nstate a brute semantic fact\u2013a fact that cannot be further\nexplained in semantic terms. It is clear that, if \u2018the author of\nWaverly\u2019 is a singular term and, contra Russell, has\nmeaning in isolation, then the relation between it and its denotation,\nScott, cannot be like the one that obtains between \u2018Scott\u2019 and\nScott.\n\nThis disanalogy between the two cases may not settle the case in\nRussell\u2019s favor\u2014perhaps, \u2018the author of\nWaverly\u2019, like \u2018Scott\u2019, is\nmeaningful in isolation after all, even though its meaning (or\ndenotation), unlike that of \u2018Scott\u2019, can\u2019t be\nassigned directly (indeed, Richard Montague provided the tools for\nconstructing precisely such a meaning). Even so, Jones is wrong in\nthinking that the mere existence of a sequence such as (7*)\u2013(9*)\nis dispositive.\n6. Related Criticisms of Russell\n\nAn important related criticism, not acknowledged by Russell in\nsubsequent writings (it appeared after his response to Jones in\n\u201cKnowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description\u201d)\nis a critique of a famous passage in Principia Mathematica.\nIn arguing that descriptions are incomplete symbols and have no\nmeaning in isolation, Russell claims that although \u2018Scott is the\nauthor of Waverley\u2019 expresses an identity, \u2018the\nauthor of Waverley\u2019 cannot be a name. If it were, then\nit would be a value of c in the propositional function\n\u2018Scott is c\u2019. But this would mean that\n\u2018Scott is the author of Waverley\u2019 expresses what\n\u2018Scott is Scott\u2019 expresses, which is absurd:\n\nThe \u201cauthor of Waverly\u201d cannot mean the same as\n\u201cScott,\u201d or \u201cScott is the author of\nWaverly\u201d would mean the same as \u201cScott is\nScott\u201d which it plainly does not; nor can the \u201cauthor of\nWaverly\u201d mean anything other than \u201cScott\u201d\nor \u201cScott is the author of Waverly\u201d would be\nfalse. Hence the \u201cauthor of Waverly\u201d means\nnothing. (Whitehead and Russell 1910, 67)\n\n\nJones observes:\n\nGranted that Intension and Denotation are\ndifferently defined, this argument seems to depend on a double use of\nthe word meaning\u2014thus: when it is said that the author of\nWaverley cannot mean the same as Scott,\nmeaning signifies intension or connotation; plainly intension\n(or connotation) of the author of Waverley and of\nScott, cannot be the same. But when it is said that the\nauthor of Waverley cannot mean anything other than\nScott, or Scott is the author of Waverley would be\nfalse, \u201cmean anything other than Scott\u201d must be\nunderstood of denotation; if Scott and the author of\nWaverley are two distinct persons, clearly Scott is the\nauthor of Waverley must be false. (My identity-in-diversity\ntheory removes the difficulty at once.) (Jones 1910\u201311,\n175\u201376)\n\n\nJones\u2019s point can be summarized as follows. When Russell argues\nthat \u2018author of Waverly\u2019 cannot mean the same as\n\u2018Scott\u2019 because this would imply that \u2018Scott is the\nauthor of Waverley\u2019 and \u2018Scott is Scott\u2019\nexpress the same proposition, he uses \u2018meaning\u2019 in an\nintensional sense: \u201cplainly intension (or connotation) of\nthe author of Waverley and of Scott, cannot be the\nsame.\u201d But when he argues that \u2018the author of\nWaverly\u2019 must mean the same thing as\n\u2018Scott\u2019, he uses \u2018meaning\u2019 in the denotational\nsense. Russell\u2019s premises, disambiguated, can be recast as\nfollows: \u2018the author of Waverly\u2019 and\n\u2018Scott\u2019 cannot have the same intension; \u2018the author\nof Waverly\u2019 and \u2018Scott\u2019 must have the same\ndenotation. From these, it does not follow that \u2018the author of\nWaverly\u2019 has neither denotation nor\nconnotation\u2014that it lacks meaning.\n\nJones seems to be perfectly correct here. The Principia\nargument intending to show that descriptions such as \u2018the author\nof Waverly\u2019 have no meaning in isolation assumes that\nan expression can only possess one kind of meaning\u2014and thus that\nsameness of meaning is either sameness of intension or sameness of\ndenotation\u2014and Jones is quite right to challenge this. (But see Perkins 2011 both for an alternative reading of the text as well as a useful history of the debate surrounding its interpretation.) \n7. The Dualism of Practical Reason\n\nAs indicated above, Jones also made significant contributions to\nethics and moral psychology. This section will focus on her major\ncontribution to these areas\u2014her attempt at a resolution to a\nproblem that Sidgwick stated in his The Methods of Ethics\n(ME), but which he never resolved to his satisfaction: the\ndualism of practical reason.\n\nA central goal of ME is to determine the rules guiding\npractical rationality and to present these as\n\u201cmethods\u201d\u2014\u201crational procedures for determining\nright conduct in any particular case\u201d (78). ME argues at\nlength for the rationality of benevolence: that our actions should\nhave \u201cUniversal Good or Happiness\u201d as their goal (507).\nBut, alongside this primary rule or method, Sidgwick also recognizes a\nsecondary rule of self-love or egoism. The latter rule, he is forced\nto acknowledge, is equally rational: \u201ceven if a man admits the\nself-evidence of the principle of Rational Benevolence, he may still\nhold that his own happiness is an end which it is irrational for him\nto sacrifice to any other; and that therefore a harmony between\nthe maxim of Prudence and the maxim of Rational Benevolence must be\nsomehow demonstrated, if morality is to be made completely\nrational\u201d (498; emphasis added). \n\nThe dualism of practical reason is precisely this fact, that practical\nreason is guided by two distinct but potentially incompatible rules.\nThis incompatibility will not always rise to the surface, but there is\na possibility that the two methods give divergent results. As Sidgwick\nwrites, in such a case, \u201cpractical reason, being divided against\nitself, would cease to be a motive on either side\u201d(508). This\nwould be unacceptable for a moral rationalist like Sidgwick, who, in\nrequiring self-evidence of his methods would surely also require that\ntheir conjunction meet the same requirement. \n\nSidgwick\u2019s dissatisfaction with this state of affairs was not simply\nintellectual. As Bart Schultz notes in his biography: \n\nThe gloomy last line of the first edition of the Methods rang\nout like an English version of the \u201ccrisis of the\nEnlightenment\u201d, warning that practical reason might be reduced\nto a \u201cchaos.\u201d (2004, 15; note removed)\n\n\nSidgwick rejected a \u201cmetaphysical\u201d resolution of the\ndualism. On this view, selfless actions are rewarded in the afterlife,\nwith God or some other force guaranteeing that self-interest and\nbenevolence coincide. He similarly dismissed the view that the methods\ncoincide due to facts about our evolutionary history\u2014that\nselectional pressures have seen to it that what we desire for\nourselves is precisely what benefits the species as a whole. In each\ncase, we are asked to believe that the circumstances in which the\nmethods deliver conflicting results will simply not arise, either due\nto \u201cthe moral government of the universe\u201d or to the\ncontingencies of natural selection. \n\nSidgwick\u2019s rationalism had him set a high bar for ethical\npropositions\u2014that they have the certainty of \u201cany axiom in\nArithmetic or Geometry\u201d (507). Since the above resolutions fall\nfar short of these standards, he could not accept them. \n\nJones addressed the dualism on various occasions throughout her career\n(Jones 1894, 1894\u201395, 1895, 1909, 1917\u201318, 1920), and a full survey of\nthese discussions is not possible here. This section will focus on her\nmost considered response to the dualism, her late publication\n\u201cPractical Dualism\u201d (Jones 1917\u201318). Where relevant, I\nwill also quote from her roughly coeval entry on Sidgwick for the\nEncyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics (Jones 1920). \n\nJones\u2019s stated aim in \u201cPractical Dualism\u201d is to\n\u201cdeduce\u201d the rule of prudence (or rational self-interest)\nfrom benevolence (Jones 1917\u201318, 323): \u201cThe reasonableness of\nbenevolence implies the reasonableness of self-love\u201d (1920,\n504). The upshot is that we have reduced our fundamental principles to\none, thus solving the problem of the dualism of two methods. \n\nThe claim that benevolence entails self-love might strike us as\npuzzling. At least since The Republic, the thought has been\nthat, if there is an entailment, it should go in the opposite\ndirection: self-love entails benevolence, and, accordingly, it is in\nmy interest to promote the happiness of others. But as the following\nmakes clear, Jones\u2019s point is slightly different: \n\nIt would thus appear that Benevolence implies Self-Love, and Rational\nBenevolence irresistibly leads us back to the rationality of Self-Love\nas our starting-point. Similarly, in the precepts \u201cDo unto\nothers as ye would (reasonably would) they should do unto\nyou,\u201d \u201cLove your neighbour as\nyourself,\u201d it is implied that the love of self is logically\nprior to, and sets the standard for, love of our neighbour. (1917\u201318,\n324; see also 1920, 504)\n\n\nWhat Jones is claiming here is that the very formulation of\nbenevolence presupposes the rationality of self-love. If we\nhad no independent conception of the value of happiness, then neither\nself-love nor benevolence would be rationally binding. But the only\nway that I can come to grasp the value of happiness is by grasping it\nin my own case. If I grasp the value of your happiness for\nyou, it is only because I already grasp the value of my happiness\nfor me: \n\nNow, a man cannot experience, cannot directly know, any happiness but\nhis own. It must, therefore, be on the ground that his own\nhappiness is to himself ultimately and intrinsically\nvaluable, valuable in itself, that he can logically regard the\nhappiness of others as ultimately and intrinsically valuable to them.\nHis reasoned belief in the value for others of their own happiness\nmust be based, it can only be based, on his recognition of the value\nfor himself of his own happiness. (323; final emphasis added)\n\n\nMy appreciation of the intrinsic value of others\u2019 happiness to them\nis grounded in my appreciation of the intrinsic value of my happiness\nfor me. What this means logically is that the principle\npresupposes self-love. That is, the principle of benevolence\nis neither true nor false if the principle of self-love is false. (See\nthe entry on\n Presupposition.)\n \n\nThus it appears that when Jones writes that \u201crational\nbenevolence implies or includes the rationality of self-love\u201d\n(328; emphasis added) she does not have logical implication in mind\nbut rather the relation of presupposition. Moreover, this claim is\nitself far more plausible on the face of it than the claim of logical\nentailment. \n\nStill, the question arises, what does the claim of presupposition\nshow? It shows at least this much, that the two principles are\nconsistent\u2014relative to the assumption, as Jones is quick to\npoint out, that benevolence is itself non-contradictory (324). This is\na significant development, since Sidgwick\u2019s central concern was with\nthe compatibility of the two principles. If benevolence requires that\nself-love be true for it to be true (or false), then the two\nmust be consistent (assuming benevolence is). \n\nOne might challenge Jones\u2019s response in two ways. One might question\nher assumption that the rule of benevolence presupposes self-love in\nprecisely the way that the Golden Rule presupposes self-love. Broad\n(1930, 158\u20139), for example, held that benevolence has no such\npresupposition. On his view, the ethical hedonist (who advocates\nbenevolence) and the rational egoist have different conceptions of the\ngood\u2014\u201cmy Good [says the egoist] and your Good\u2026 are\nnot parts of a total Good.\u201d Since they involve distinct\nconceptions of the good, the formulation of the one position cannot\npresuppose the truth of the other. Nonetheless, since they make\nconflicting commands regarding certain conceivable situations, we\ncannot rationally subscribe to both. \n\nThe other concern is that she has, at best, shown that one who\nembraces benevolence cannot consistently reject self-love. But this\ndoes not give us a positive argument for the rational egoist to accept\nbenevolence. Jones does argue, in \u201cPractical Dualism,\u201d\nthat as humans we are by nature empathetic, often, through an innate\nimpulse, identifying our happiness with the happiness of others. While\nit may be possible to argue, on such a basis, that the mere possession\nof the concept of happiness makes us value it in others as much as we\nvalue it in ourselves, it remains the case that this is a\npsychological fact. While it may be so that we by nature are drawn to\nvalue in others what we value in ourselves, it does not follow that we\nrationally ought to do so simply because we do so\u2014or even that\nwe ought to do so\u2014in our own case. \n\nOstertag and Favia (2020) presents a more comprehensive account of\nJones\u2019s responses. See Soames (2014, 263\u201369) and the entries on\n Henry Sidgwick\n and\n Bertrand Russell\u2019s Moral Philosophy\n for more on the Sidgwickian background. \n8. Women in Early Analytic Philosophy\n\nJones was not the only woman approaching philosophical logic and\nethics from a broadly analytic perspective during this period:\nPeirce\u2019s student, Christine Ladd-Franklin (1847\u20131930), made\nsignificant contributions to logic and psychology (see Russinoff 1999\nfor Ladd-Franklin\u2019s contributions to the algebra of logic), and\nthe writings of Lady Victoria Welby (1837\u20131912) on meaning were\nwidely read. Indeed, Peirce wrote a joint review of her What is\nMeaning? and Russell\u2019s Principles of Mathematics\nfor The Nation. (Dale 1996 discusses Welby\u2019s role in\nthe development of the theory of meaning.) Later figures include the\nphilosopher of science, Dorothy Wrinch (1894\u20131976), a Girton\nstudent who went on to study under Russell, and Susanne Langer\n(1895\u20131985), who wrote a dissertation under Alfred North\nWhitehead at Radcliff in 1926. Wrinch, who published papers in\nMind on, among other things, the unity of the proposition and\nthe theory of relativity, later abandoned philosophy for chemistry,\nteaching for many years at Smith College. Langer, who would achieve\nprominence in the philosophy of art beginning in the 1940s, published\nseveral technical articles on type theory and related topics early in\nher career (Langer 1926, 1927; McDaniel 2017 is a useful guide to her\nearly work). Possibly the most prominent woman analytic philosopher of\nthe first half of the twentieth century, however, was another Girton\nstudent,\n L. Susan Stebbing\n (1885\u20131943), Professor of Philosophy at Bedford College,\nLondon, and co-founder of the journal Analysis. Stebbing,\nthrough her most successful student, Max Black, is responsible for one\nof the largest \u201cfamilies\u201d in Josh Dever\u2019s Philosophy\nFamily Tree (see Other Internet Resources).\n\nWaithe (1995) is an important resource for research into these women,\nas well as numerous minor figures; see also van der Schaar and\nSchliesser (2017). On the larger question of the erasure of women from\nthe history of philosophy, from antiquity to the French Revolution,\nEileen O\u2019Neill\u2019s essay, \u201cDisappearing Ink\u201d\n(O\u2019Neill 1998), remains indispensable.\n",
