    "main_text": "Discourse Ethics || (U) and Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative\n3.4 (U) and Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative\n\nPrinciples (D) and (U) are supposed to capture the practice of\nuniversalization in ethics, but in a social sense that differs from\napparently similar procedures in Rawls, whom Habermas takes to be\nworking in the Kantian tradition of political philosophy. The\ndifferences are as follows. (U) is not presented as a moral norm: it\nis not formulated as an imperative. Initially, (U) is presented as\n\u201ca bridging principle\u201d on analogy with the principle of\ninduction, except that (U) tests whether norms are amenable to\nconsensus among all affected, given their interests. (U) is not a\nhypothetical test for generating moral norms. It rationally\nreconstructs an actual practice by which real moral\nagents, as participants in an actual discourse, themselves ascertain\nthe validity of moral norms, or institute them. Finally, whereas,\naccording to Habermas, the test of universalization contained in\nKant\u2019s first formulation of the Categorical Imperative is\n\u201cmonological\u201d, since it can be performed by each person\nindividually, the procedure captured by (U) is\n\u201cdialogical\u201d since it must involve other people acting\ntogether. As McCarthy puts it:\n\n\nRather than ascribing as valid to all others any maxim that I can will\nto be a universal law, I must submit my maxim to all others for the\npurposes of discursively testing its claim to universality. The\nemphasis shifts from what each can will without contradiction to be a\ngeneral law, to what all can will in agreement to be a universal norm.\n(1983 [1990: 67], Habermas quoting McCarthy 1978: 326)\n\n\nFinally, on the Kantian conception a maxim is adopted in virtue of its\nuniversal form, whereas on Habermas\u2019s conception it is not just\nthe form of the maxim that is universalized. It is in part the\ncontent of the norm that is universalized. This is\nwhy (U) refers to the \u201cinterests\u201d of everyone affected it.\nBut on Habermas\u2019s view universalization is thought of as a\nsocial process that extends to the very self-conception of the moral\nagent. Habermas\u2019s guiding idea here is G. H. Mead\u2019s notion\nof \u201cideal role taking\u201d (1988b: chapter 3 [1992a]; 1983\n[1990: 56\u201368, 121]), in which moral agents learn by projecting\nthemselves into the position of all other moral agents. This is a\nprocess whereby agents consider \u201cevery interest involved\u201d\nand evaluate what is \u201cgood for everyone under the same\nconditions\u201d, a process that, according to Mead, leads \u201cto\nthe development of a larger self, which can be identified with the\ninterests of others\u201d (Mead 1934 [1962: 363]).\n",
