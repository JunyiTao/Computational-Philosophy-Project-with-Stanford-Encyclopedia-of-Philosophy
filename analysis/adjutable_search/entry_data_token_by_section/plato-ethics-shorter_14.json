    "main_text": "Hippias Minor\n18. Hippias Minor\n\nThe Hippias Minor shows Socrates defeating a sophist on an\nethical matter: whether it is better to do wrong voluntarily or in\nignorance. Socrates concludes, somewhat unhappily, that it is better\nto do wrong voluntarily. The issue arises in the context of\nHippias\u2019 multiple claims to expertise; he can win speaking\ncontests on any topic, and he has excelled in many different arts,\nfrom shoemaking to the art of memory (363cd, 368be). Socrates asks a\nquestion that at first appears to be about Homer\u2014which is the\nbetter man, Achilles or Odysseus? The tradition has been to regard\nAchilles as honest, and Odysseus as given to lying, but it is this\ntradition that Socrates intends to bring into question. He argues, by\nexample, that an expert in any given field is best able to speak false\nin that field, since an amateur liar might stumble on the truth. It\nfollows that a good liar will be an expert in the subject of his lies,\nand he will also be a good truth teller in that field, and vice\nversa. So if Achilles is a good truth teller, he will be a good\nliar as well, and if Odysseus is a good liar, he will be a good truth\nteller also.\n\nHippias rejects this conclusion. He argues that Homer shows Achilles\nto be honest and Odysseus to be a liar through the speech at\nIliad 9.308, ff., which Achilles addresses to Odysseus:\n\u201cI hate like the gates of hell that man who says one thing and\nhas another in his mind.\u201d Hippias is doubly mistaken in using\nthis passage as evidence for his view. At most this would show that\nAchilles (not Homer) takes Odysseus to be a liar, but in fact the text\nclearly refers to Agamemnon. Achilles takes Odysseus\u2019 word for\nwhat Agamemnon has promised him, but he believes that Agamemnon is a\nliar and that his promise is not truthful.\n\nSocrates cannot interrogate Homer on the matter, so he will\ninvestigate only the opinion of Hippias (365cd), although he will cite\nHomeric texts in support of his position. Socrates argues that\nAchilles is more deceptive than Odysseus, because on several occasions\nhe does not stay true to what he has said. Hippias rightly points out\nthat Achilles had no intention to deceive; he merely said what was in\nhis heart at each moment. Because his falsehood is involuntary, argues\nHippias, Achilles is the better man. Socrates disagrees: the voluntary\nliar knows his subject better and has the better mind. He is therefore\nthe better man of the two.\n\nThis leads Socrates to his main theme: whether one who does wrong\nvoluntarily is better or worse than someone who does wrong\ninvoluntarily (373c). Arguing by example, Socrates shows that any\nfailure, ethical or otherwise, would be better if it came as the\nresult of a deliberate choice, because that would imply that the\nperson who erred had the knowledge to do the thing right if he or she\nwanted to. He concludes: \u201cThen he who voluntarily goes wrong\n(hekon hamartanon), doing shameful and unjust\nthings, if indeed he exists, would be no other than the good\nman\u201d (376b). Hippias cannot accept this line of reasoning, and\nSocrates admits he is uncomfortable with it (\u201cNo more can I\nconcede the point to myself\u201d).\n\nThe argument for this conclusion assumed from the outset that it is\npossible to go wrong voluntarily; this was Hippias\u2019 proposal in\nthe case of Odysseus. But Socrates has assumed or stated the contrary\nelsewhere: no one goes wrong voluntarily (Apology 26a,\nProtagoras 345e). The argument also assumes that people do\ngood and bad actions on the basis of techne; it is reasonable\nto suppose that a\n techne\n that could lead to good actions could also lead to bad ones. But\ntechne can be taught, so that if good and bad action are due\nto a techne, then people could be taught to act well or\npoorly. But Socrates does not believe that virtue can be taught\n(Protagoras 319a\u2013320c). In sum, the awkward conclusion\n(that it is better to do wrong voluntarily) would follow from premises\nthat Hippias supports, but not from the views Socrates elsewhere\naffirms.\n",
