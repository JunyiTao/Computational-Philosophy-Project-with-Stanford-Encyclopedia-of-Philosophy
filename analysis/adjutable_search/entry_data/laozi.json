    "preamble": "\n\n\nConfucianism, Daoism (Taoism), and Buddhism generally name the three\nmain currents of Chinese thought, although it should be obvious that\nlike any \u201cism,\u201d they are abstractions\u2014what they name\nare not monolithic but multifaceted traditions with fuzzy\nboundaries. In the case of \u201cDaoism,\u201d it designates both a\nphilosophical tradition and an organized religion, which in modern\nChinese are identified separately as daojia\nand daojiao, respectively. With their own rich histories and\ninternal differences, the two are deeply intertwined. Laozi (or\nLao-tzu, in the \u201cWade-Giles\u201d system of transliteration\nfavored by earlier generations of Western scholars) figures centrally\nin both.\n\n\nPhilosophical Daoism traces its origins to Laozi, an extraordinary\nthinker who flourished during the sixth century B.C.E., according to\nChinese sources. According to some modern scholars, however, Laozi is\nentirely legendary; there was never a historical Laozi. In religious\nDaoism, Laozi is revered as a supreme deity.\n\n\nThe name \u201cLaozi\u201d is best taken to mean \u201cOld\n(lao) Master (zi),\u201d and Laozi the ancient\nphilosopher is said to have written a short book, which has come to be\ncalled simply the Laozi, after its putative author, a common\npractice in early China.\n\n\nWhen the Laozi was recognized as a \u201cclassic\u201d\n(jing)\u2014that is, accorded canonical status in the\nclassification of Chinese literature, on account of its profound\ninsight and significance\u2014it acquired a more exalted and\nhermeneutically instructive title, Daodejing (Tao-te\nching), commonly translated as the \u201cClassic of the Way and\nVirtue.\u201d Its influence on Chinese culture is pervasive, and it\nreaches beyond China. It is concerned with the Dao or\n\u201cWay\u201d and how it finds expression in \u201cvirtue\u201d\n(de), especially through what the text calls\n\u201cnaturalness\u201d (ziran) and \u201cnonaction\u201d\n(wuwei). These concepts, however, are open to\ninterpretation. While some interpreters see them as evidence that\nthe Laozi is a deeply spiritual work, others emphasize their\ncontribution to ethics and/or political philosophy. Interpreting\nthe Laozi demands careful hermeneutic reconstruction, which\nrequires both analytic rigor and an informed historical\nimagination.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Laozi Story\n\n\nThe Shiji (Records of the Historian) by the Han dynasty (206\nB.C.E.\u2013220 C.E.) court scribe and historian Sima Qian\n(ca. 145\u201386 B.C.E.) offers a \u201cbiography\u201d of\nLaozi. Its reliability has been questioned, but it provides a point of\ndeparture for reconstructing the Laozi story.\n\n\nLaozi was a native of Chu, according to the Shiji, a southern\nstate in the Zhou dynasty (see map and discussion in Loewe and\nShaughnessy 1999, 594 and 597). His surname was Li; his given name was\nEr, and he was also called Dan.\n\n\nLaozi served as a keeper of archival records at the court of\nZhou. Confucius (551\u2013479 B.C.E.) had consulted him on certain\nritual matters, we are told, and praised him lavishly afterward\n(Shiji 63). This establishes the traditional claim that Laozi\nwas a senior contemporary of Confucius. A meeting, or meetings,\nbetween Confucius and Laozi, identified as \u201cLao Dan,\u201d is\nreported also in the Zhuangzi and other early Chinese\nsources.\n\n\n\u201cLaozi cultivated Dao and virtue,\u201d as Sima Qian goes on to\nrelate, and \u201chis learning was devoted to self-effacement and not\nhaving fame. He lived in Zhou for a long time; witnessing the decline\nof Zhou, he departed.\u201d When he reached the northwest border then\nseparating China from the outside world, he met Yin Xi, the official\nin charge of the border crossing, who asked him to put his teachings\ninto writing. The result was a book consisting of some five thousand\nChinese characters, divided into two parts, which discusses \u201cthe\nmeaning of Dao and virtue.\u201d Thereafter, Laozi left; no one knew\nwhere he had gone. This completes the main part of Sima Qian\u2019s\naccount. The remainder puts on record attempts to identify the\nlegendary Laozi with certain known historical individuals and\nconcludes with a list of Laozi\u2019s purported descendants (see W. T. Chan\n1963, Lau 1963, or Henricks 2000 for an English translation).\n\n\nFew scholars today would subscribe fully to the Shiji\nreport. Indeed, according to William Boltz, it \u201ccontains\nvirtually nothing that is demonstrably factual; we are left no choice\nbut to acknowledge the likely fictional nature of the traditional Lao\ntzu [Laozi] figure\u201d (1993, 270). Disagreements abound on every\nfront, including the name Laozi itself. Although the majority takes\n\u201cLaozi\u201d to mean \u201cOld Master,\u201d some scholars\nbelieve that \u201cLao\u201d is a surname. The Zhuangzi and\nother early texts refer to \u201cLao Dan\u201d consistently, but not\n\u201cLi Er.\u201d The name \u201cDan\u201d is generally\nunderstood to depict the bearer\u2019s \u201clong ears,\u201d a mark of\nlongevity in Chinese physiognomy. According to Fung Yu-lan, Sima Qian\nhad \u201cconfused\u201d the legendary Lao Dan with Li Er, who\nflourished later during the \u201cWarring States\u201d period\n(480\u2013221 B.C.E.) and was the \u201creal\u201d founder of the\nDaoist school (daojia) (1983, 171).\n\n\nIn an influential essay, A. C. Graham (1986) argues that the story of\nLaozi reflects a conflation of different legends. The earliest strand\nrevolved around the meeting of Confucius with Lao Dan and was current\nby the fourth century B.C.E. During the first half of the third\ncentury, Lao Dan was recognized as a great thinker in his own right\nand as the founder of a distinct \u201cLaoist\u201d school of\nthought. It was not until the Han dynasty, when the teachings of\nLaozi, Zhuangzi, and others were seen to share certain insights\ncentering on the concept of Dao, that they were classified together\nunder the rubric of philosophical \u201cDaoism.\u201d\n\n\nI cite these views here only to give a sense of the diversity and\nvolume of research on the Laozi story. It is clear that by 100\nB.C.E. if not earlier, Laozi was already shrouded in legends and that\nSima Qian could only exercise his judgment as an historian to put\ntogether a report that made sense to him, based on the different and\nsometimes competing sources at his disposal.\n\n\nThe fact that Laozi appears favorably in both Confucian and Daoist\nsources seems to argue against the likelihood that the figure was\nfabricated for polemical purposes. It is conceivable that a\nphilosopher known as Lao Dan attracted a following based on his novel\nreading of the Way and virtue. Deferentially, his followers would\nrefer to him as \u201cLaozi.\u201d\n\n\nConfucius had sought his advice presumably on mourning and funeral\nrites, given that the Confucian work Liji (Records of Rites)\nhas Confucius citing Lao Dan four times specifically on these\nrites. Indeed, various dates have been proposed for the\nencounter\u2014for example, 501 B.C.E., following the account in\nthe Zhuangzi (ch. 14). In any case, testifying to its appeal,\ndifferent accounts of the meeting circulated among the educated elite\nduring the Warring States period. Other details then came to be\nassociated with Lao Dan, which formed the basis of Sima Qian\u2019s\nreconstruction.\n\n\nAdmittedly, this is conjecture. Though I find little reason not to\naccept the traditional claim that Laozi was a senior contemporary of\nConfucius, the identity of the \u201cOld Master\u201d no doubt will\ncontinue to attract and divide scholarly opinion. In many popular\naccounts, Laozi is described as the \u201cfounder\u201d or\n\u201cfather\u201d of \u201cDaoism.\u201d This begs a number of\nquestions and therefore should not be taken uncritically, and this is\nthe reason why a fairly extended discussion of the Shiji\nLaozi story is offered here.\n\n\nThe story of Laozi occupies a cherished place in the Daoist\ntradition. It is important also because it raises certain hermeneutic\nexpectations and affects the way in which the Laozi is\nread. If the work was written by a single author, one might expect,\nfor example, a high degree of consistency in style and content. If\nthe Laozi was a work of the sixth or fifth century B.C.E.,\none might interpret certain sayings in the light of what we know of\nthe period. There is little consensus among scholars, however, on the\ndate or authorship of the Laozi, as we shall see below.\n\n\nWith the arrival of the \u201cWay of the Celestial Masters\u201d\n(tianshidao), the first organized religious Daoist\nestablishment (daojiao) in the second century C.E., the story\nof Laozi gained an important hagiographic dimension.\n\n\nThe founding of \u201cCelestial Master\u201d or \u201cHeavenly\nMaster\u201d Daoism was based on a new revelation of the Dao by Laozi\n(on which see Kohn 1998a and 1998b, Kleeman 2016, and the\nentry on \n  religious Daoism). In the eyes of\nthe faithful, the Dao is a\ndivine reality, and Laozi is seen as the personification of the\nDao. Lao Dan is but one manifestation of the divine Laozi, albeit a\npivotal one because of the writing of the Daodejing, which in\nreligious Daoism commands devotion as a foundational scripture that\npromises not only wisdom but also immortality and salvation to those\nwho submit to its power. During the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 C.E.),\nthe imperial Li family traced its ancestry to Laozi. Today, Laozi\u2019s\n\u201cbirthday\u201d is celebrated in many parts of Asia on the\nfifteenth day of the second lunar month.\n\n\nThe influence of the Laozi on Chinese culture is both deep\nand far-reaching. One indication of its enduring appeal and\nhermeneutical openness is the large number of commentaries devoted to\nit throughout Chinese history\u2014some seven hundred, according to\none count (W. T. Chan 1963, 77). The Laozi has inspired an\nintellectual movement known as xuanxue, \u201cLearning in\nthe Profound\u201d\u2014or \u201cNeo-Daoism,\u201d as some\nscholars prefer, emphasizing its roots in classical Daoism\u2014that\ndominated the Chinese elite or high culture from the third to the\nsixth century C.E. (See the entry on \u201cNeo-Daoism\u201d in\nthis Encyclopedia.) The Laozi played a significant\nrole in informing not only philosophic thought but also the\ndevelopment of literature, calligraphy, painting, music, martial arts,\nand other cultural traditions.\n\n\nImperial patronage enhanced the prestige of the Laozi and\nenlarged its scope of influence. In 733 C.E., the emperor Xuanzong\ndecreed that all officials should keep a copy of\nthe Daodejing at home and placed the classic on the list of\ntexts to be examined for the civil service examinations (see, e.g.,\nthe report in the official Tang history, Jiu Tang shu 8). In\nreligious Daoism, recitation of the Daodejing is a prescribed\ndevotional practice and features centrally in ritual\nperformance. The Daodejing has been set to music from an\nearly time. The term \u201cLaozi learning\u201d\n(Laoxue) has come to designate an important field of study. A\nuseful work in Chinese that sketches the major landmarks in this\ndevelopment is Zhongguo Laoxue shi (A History\nof Laozi Learning in China) (Xiong Tieji, et al. 1995); a\nfollow-up effort focusing on Laozi scholarship in the\ntwentieth century by the same lead author was published in 2002.\n\n\nThe influence of the Laozi extends beyond China, as Daoism\nreaches across Asia and in the modern period, the Western world. In\nHong Kong, Taiwan, and among the Chinese in Southeast Asia and beyond,\nDaoism is a living tradition. Daoist beliefs and practices have\ncontributed also to the formation of Korean and Japanese culture,\nalthough here the process of cultural transmission, assimilation, and\ntransformation is complex, especially given the close interaction\namong Daoism, Buddhism, and indigenous traditions such as Shint\u014d\n(see Fukui, et al. 1983, vol. 3).\n\n\nDuring the seventh century, the Laozi was translated into\nSanskrit; in the eighteenth century a Latin translation was brought to\nEngland, after which there has been a steady supply of translations\ninto Western languages, yielding a handsome harvest of some 250\n(LaFargue and Pas 1998, 277), with new ones still hitting bookstores\nand internet sites almost every year. Some of the more notable recent\ntranslations in English are Roberts 2001, Ivanhoe 2002, Ames and Hall\n2003, Wagner 2003, Moeller 2007, Ryden and Penny 2008, and Kim 2012. A\nforthcoming translation is Minford 2018.\n\n\nLaozi is an \u201caxial\u201d philosopher whose insight helps shape\nthe course of human development, according to Karl Jaspers (1974). The\ninfluence of the Laozi on Western thinkers is the subject of\nClarke 2000. Memorable phrases from the Laozi such as\n\u201cgoverning a large country is like cooking a small fish\u201d\n(ch. 60) have found their way into global political rhetoric. At the\npopular level, several illustrated or \u201ccomic\u201d versions of\nthe Laozi reach out to a younger and wider readership (e.g.,\nTsai Chih Chung, et al. 1995, now available also on YouTube). Some may\nhave come to learn about the Laozi through such best-selling\nworks as The Tao of Physics (Capra 1975) or The Tao of\nPooh (Hoff 1982); and there is also A Taoist Cookbook\n(Saso 1994), which comes with \u201cmeditations\u201d from\nthe Daodejing. From nature lovers to management gurus, a\ngrowing audience is discovering that the Laozi has something\nto offer to them. The reception of the Laozi in modern Asia\nand the West falls outside the scope of this article; nevertheless, it\nis important to note that the Laozi should be regarded not\nonly as a work of early Chinese philosophy, but also in a larger\ncontext as a classic of world literature with keen contemporary\nrelevance.\n\n\nThe next three sections are intended for readers who are interested in\nthe textual history and commentarial tradition of the Laozi,\nincluding the major manuscripts recovered through archaeological\nexcavations or from the antiquities market. They are important to\nunderstanding the Laozi, but one may go directly to section 5\non the main interpretive approaches to the text if one wishes to\nbypass them.\n2. Date and Authorship of the Laozi\n\n\nThe date of composition refers to the time when the Laozi\nreached more or less its final form; it does not rule out later\ninterpolations or corruptions. The traditional view, of course, is\nthat the Laozi was written by Lao Dan in the sixth or early\nfifth century B.C.E. This seems unlikely, however, if it is assumed\nthat the Laozi was written by a single author. As the\narchaeological evidence to be presented below will indicate, bodies of\nsayings attributed to Laozi were committed to writing probably from\nthe second half of the fifth century B.C.E., resulting in different\ncollections with overlapping contents. These collections grew,\ncompeted for attention, and gradually came to be consolidated during\nthe fourth century B.C.E. By the middle of the third century B.C.E.,\nthe Laozi probably reached a relatively stable form.\n\n\nIt is possible, as A. C. Graham suggests, that the Laozi was\nascribed to Lao Dan around 250 B.C.E. by the text\u2019s author or\n\u201cpubliciser,\u201d capitalizing on Lao Dan\u2019s reputation (1986,\n119; also see Graham 1989). It is also possible that\nthe Laozi has \u201cpreserved\u201d the ideas of Lao\nDan. W. T. Chan, for example, believes that the text\n\u201cembodied\u201d the teachings of Laozi, although it was not\nwritten until the fourth century (1963, 74).\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to suppose that Laozi, whether or not his real\nname was Li Er, attracted a following and that some of his sayings\nentered the world of Chinese philosophical discourse during the fifth\ncentury B.C.E. A process of oral transmission may have preceded the\nappearance of these sayings in written form.\n\n\nIt is conceivable that a succession of editors or compilers brought\ntogether diverse bodies of Laozi sayings, resulting in the\nmature Laozi. D. C. Lau, for example, is of the view that\nthe Laozi is an \u201canthology\u201d (1963, 14). According\nto Bruce Brooks and Taeko Brooks, the Laozi contains\ndifferent layers of material spanning the period between 340 and 249\nB.C.E.\u2014\u201cits long timespan precludes a single author\u201d\n(1998, 151). Indeed, Chad Hansen describes the \u201cdominant current\ntextual theory\u201d of the Daodejing as one which\n\u201ctreats the text as an edited accumulation of fragments and bits\ndrawn from a wide variety of sources \u2026 there was no single\nauthor, no Laozi\u201d (1992, 201).\n\n\nAlthough in this sense the Laozi may be regarded as a\ncomposite work, the product of many hands over a long period of time,\nit should not be assumed that the sayings that now inhabit\nthe Laozi were put together at random. More likely, the final\nproduct reflects a process of intellectual distillation on the part of\nthe compilers, who arranged and/or altered the material at their\ndisposal (see also LaFargue 1992 and Mair 1990 on the composition of\nthe Laozi).\n\n\nThe language of the Laozi does provide some clues to its date\nof composition. Much of the text is rhymed. Focusing on rhyme\npatterns, Liu Xiaogan (1994 and 1997) concludes that the poetic\nstructure of the Laozi is closer to that of\nthe Shijing (Classic of Poetry) than that of the\nlater Chuci (Songs of Chu).\n\n\nThe dating of the Shijing and the Chuci is by no\nmeans precise, although generally the poems collected in the former\nshould not be later than the early fifth century B.C.E., whereas those\ncollected in the latter can be traced to no earlier than the middle of\nthe Warring States period, around 300 B.C.E. For this reason, Liu\nXiaogan argues, the traditional view first articulated by Sima Qian\nshould be upheld. Examining a wider range of linguistic evidence,\nWilliam Baxter agrees that the Laozi should be dated earlier\nthan the Zhuangzi and the Chuci, but he traces\n\u201cthe bulk of the Lao-tzu to the mid or early fourth\ncentury\u201d (1998, 249). Both Liu and Baxter provide a concise\nanalysis of the different theories of the date of\nthe Laozi.\n\n\nWhy is all this important? It may be argued that date and authorship\nare immaterial to and may detract from interpretation. The\n\u201ctruth\u201d of the Laozi is \u201ctimeless,\u201d\naccording to this view, transcending historical and cultural\nspecificities. Issues of provenance are important, however, if context\nhas any role to play in the production of meaning.\n\n\nPolemics among different schools of thought, for example, were far\nmore pronounced during the Warring States period than in the earlier\n\u201cSpring and Autumn\u201d period (770\u2013481 B.C.E.). (There\nare different ways to date the Spring and Autumn and Warring States\nperiods, but they do not affect the discussion here.) The Zhou\ngovernment had been in decline; warfare among the \u201cfeudal\u201d\nstates intensified both in scale and frequency from the fourth century\nB.C.E. onward. As the political conditions deteriorated, philosophers\nand strategists, who grew both in number and popularity as a social\ngroup or profession during this time, vied to convince the rulers of\nthe various states of their program to bring order to the land. At the\nsame time, perhaps with the increased displacement and disillusionment\nof the privileged elite, a stronger eremitic tradition also\nemerged. If the bulk of the Laozi had originated from the\nfourth century, it might reflect some of these concerns. From this\nperspective, the origin of the Laozi is as much a\nhermeneutical issue as it is a historical one.\n3. Textual Traditions\n\n\nThe discovery of two Laozi silk manuscripts at Mawangdui,\nnear Changsha, Hunan province in 1973 marks an important milestone in\nmodern Laozi research. The manuscripts, identified simply as\n\u201cA\u201d (jia) and \u201cB\u201d (yi), were\nfound in a tomb that was sealed in 168 B.C.E. The texts themselves can\nbe dated earlier, the \u201cA\u201d manuscript being the older of\nthe two, copied in all likelihood before 195 B.C.E. (see Lau 1982,\nBoltz 1984, and Henricks 1989). A documentary on the Mawangdui find\nwas aired on Chinese CCTV-10 in June 2010, which can be viewed from\nits website. The Hunan Provincial Museum website also provides useful\ninformation.\n\n\nBefore this find, access to the Laozi was mainly through the\nreceived text of Wang Bi (226\u2013249 C.E.) and Heshanggong, a\nlegendary figure depicted as a teacher to Emperor Wen\n(r. 179\u2013157 B.C.E.) of the Han dynasty. There are other\nmanuscript versions, but by and large they play a secondary role in\nthe history of the classic.\n\n\nA more recent archaeological find in Guodian, the so-called\n\u201cBamboo-slip Laozi,\u201d which predates the Mawangdui\nmanuscripts, has rekindled debates on the origin and composition of\nthe Laozi. But first, a note on the title and structure of\nthe Daodejing.\n\n\nThe Laozi did not acquire its \u201cclassic\u201d status\nuntil the Han dynasty. According to the Shiji (49.5b), the\nEmpress Dowager Dou\u2014wife of Emperor Wen and mother of Emperor\nJing (r. 156\u2013141 B.C.E.)\u2014was a dedicated student of\nthe Laozi. Later sources added that it was Emperor Jing who\nestablished the text officially as a classic. However, the\ntitle Daodejing appears not to have been widely used until\nlater, toward the close of the Han era.\n\n\nThe Daodejing is also referred to as the Daode\nzhenjing (True Classic of the Way and Virtue), the Taishang\nxuanyuan daodejing (Classic of the Way and Virtue of the Highest\nProfound Origins), and less formally the \u201cfive-thousand\ncharacter\u201d text, on account of its approximate length. Most\nversions exceed five thousand characters by about five to ten percent,\nbut it is interesting to note that numerological considerations later\nbecame an integral part of the history of the work. According to the\nseventh-century Daoist master Cheng Xuanying, it was Ge Xuan (fl. 200\nC.E.), a revered Daoist adept, who shortened the Laozi text\nthat accompanied the Heshanggong commentary to fit the magical number\nof five thousand. This claim cannot be verified, but a number\nof Laozi manuscripts discovered at Dunhuang contain 4,999\ncharacters.\n\n\nThe current Daodejing is divided into two parts\n(pian) and 81 chapters or sections (zhang). Part\none, comprising chapters 1\u201337, has come to be known as\nthe Daojing (Classic of Dao), while chapters 38\u201381 make\nup the Dejing (Classic of Virtue).\n\n \nThis is understood to be a thematic division\u2014chapter 1 begins\nwith the word Dao, while chapter 38 begins with the phrase\n\u201csuperior virtue\u201d\u2014although the concepts of Dao and\nvirtue (de) feature in both parts. As a rough heuristic\nguide, some commentators have suggested that the Daojing is\nmore \u201cmetaphysical,\u201d whereas the Dejing focuses\nmore on sociopolitical issues.\n\n\nIn this context, it is easy to appreciate the tremendous interest\noccasioned by the discovery of the Mawangdui Laozi\nmanuscripts. The two manuscripts contain all the chapters that are\nfound in the current Laozi, although the chapters follow a\ndifferent order in a few places. For example, in both manuscripts, the\nsections that appear as chapters 80 and 81 in the\ncurrent Laozi come immediately after a section that\ncorresponds to chapter 66 of the present text.\n\n\nBoth the Mawangdui \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d manuscripts are\nsimilarly divided into two parts, but in contrast with the current\nversion, in reverse order; i.e., both manuscripts begin with\nthe Dejing, corresponding to chapter 38 of the received\ntext. \u201cPart one\u201d of the \u201cB\u201d manuscript ends\nwith the editorial notation, \u201cVirtue, 3,041 [characters],\u201d\nwhile the last line of \u201cPart two\u201d reads: \u201cDao,\n2,426.\u201d Does this mean that the classic should be renamed,\nfrom Daodejing to \u201cDedaojing\u201d (Classic\nof Virtue and the Way)? One scholar, in fact, has adopted the\ntitle Dedaojing (Te-Tao ching) for his translation\nof the Mawangdui Laozi (Henricks 1989).\n\n\nIt seems unlikely that the Mawangdui arrangement stems simply from\nscribal idiosyncrasy or happenstance\u2014e.g., that the copyist, in\nwriting out the Laozi on silk, had made use of an original\ntext in bamboo slips and just happened to start with a bundle of slips\ncontaining the Dejing (Yan 1976, 12, explains how this is\npossible). If the order is deliberate, does it imply that the\n\u201coriginal\u201d Laozi gives priority to sociopolitical\nissues? This raises important questions for interpretation.\n\n\nThe division into 81 chapters reflects numerological interest and is\nassociated particularly with the Heshanggong version, which also\ncarries chapter titles. It was not universally accepted until much\nlater, perhaps the Tang period, when the text was standardized under\nthe patronage of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712\u2013756). Traditional\nsources report that some versions were divided into 64, 68, or 72\nchapters; and some did not have chapter divisions (Henricks 1982).\n\n\nThe Mawangdui \u201cA\u201d manuscript contains in some places a dot\nor \u201cperiod\u201d that appears to signal the beginning of a\nchapter. The earlier Guodian texts (see below) are not divided into\ntwo parts, but in many places they employ a black square mark to\nindicate the end of a section. The sections or chapters so marked\ngenerally agree with the division in the present Laozi. Thus,\nalthough the 81-chapter formation may be relatively late, some attempt\nat chapter division seems evident from an early stage of the textual\nhistory of the Daodejing.\n\n\nUntil about two decades ago, the Mawangdui manuscripts held the pride\nof place as the oldest extant manuscripts of the Laozi. In\nlate 1993, the excavation of a tomb (identified as M1) in Guodian,\nJingmen city, Hubei province, yielded among other things some 800\nbamboo slips, of which 730 are inscribed, containing over 13,000\nChinese characters. Some of these, amounting to about 2,000\ncharacters, match the Laozi (see Allan and Williams 2000, and\nHenricks 2000). The tomb is located near the old capital of the state\nof Chu and is dated around 300 B.C.E. Robbers entered the tomb before\nit was excavated, although the extent of the damage is uncertain.\n\n\nThe bamboo texts, written in a Chu script, have been transcribed into\nstandard Chinese and published under the title Guodian Chumu\nzhujian (Beijing: Wenwu, 1998), which on the basis of the size\nand shape of the slips, calligraphy, and other factors divides\nthe Laozi material into three groups. Group A contains\nthirty-nine bamboo slips, which correspond in whole or in part to the\nfollowing chapters of the present text: 19, 66, 46, 30, 15, 64, 37,\n63, 2, 32, 25, 5, 16, 64, 56, 57, 55, 44, 40 and 9. Groups B and C are\nsmaller, with eighteen (chs. 59, 48, 20, 13, 41, 52, 45, 54) and\nfourteen slips (chs. 17, 18, 35, 31, 64), respectively.\n\n\nOn the whole, the Guodian \u201cbamboo-slip Laozi\u201d is\nconsistent with the received text, although the placement or sequence\nof the chapters is different and there are numerous variant and/or\narchaic characters. Particularly, whereas chapter 19 of the\ncurrent Laozi contains what appears to be a strong attack on\nConfucian ideals\u2014\u201cCut off benevolence (ren),\ndiscard rightness (yi)\u201d\u2014the Guodian\n\u201cA\u201d text directs its readers to \u201ccut off\nartificiality, discard deceit.\u201d This has been taken to suggest\nthat in the course of its transmission, the Laozi has taken\non a more \u201cpolemical\u201d outlook. However, the Guodian\n\u201cC\u201d text indicates that ren and yi arose\nonly after the \u201cGreat Dao\u201d had gone into decline, which\nagrees with chapter 18 of the current Laozi. In other words,\nit would be a hasty assumption that the Guodian texts do not engage in\na critique of some of the key ideas central to the \u201cRu\u201d or\nConfucian tradition.\n\n\nIt is not clear whether the Guodian bamboo manuscripts were copied\nfrom one source and meant to be read as one text divided into three\nparts, whether they were \u201cselections\u201d from a longer\noriginal, or whether they were three different texts copied from\ndifferent sources at different times (for a nuanced discussion, see\nBoltz 1999). There is one important clue, however. The \u201cA\u201d\nand \u201cC\u201d texts give two different versions of what is now\npart of chapter 64 of the Laozi, which suggests that they\ncame from different sources. One scholar at least has suggested a\nchronology to the making of the Guodian Laozi bamboo slips,\nwith the \u201cA\u201d group being the oldest of the three, copied\naround 400 B.C.E. (Ding 2000, 7\u20139).\n\n\nTaking into account all the available evidence, it seems likely that\ndifferent collections of sayings attributed to Laozi expanded and\ngained currency during the fourth century B.C.E. They would have been\nderived from earlier, oral or written sources. During the third\ncentury B.C.E., the Laozi settled more or less into its final\nform. It was then quoted extensively in such works as\nthe Hanfeizi and the \u201couter\u201d and\n\u201cmiscellaneous\u201d chapters of the Zhuangzi, and\nbegan to attract commentarial attention.\n\n\nEven more recently, the growing family of Laozi texts\nwelcomed another new arrival.  In January 2009, Peking University\naccepted a gift of a sizeable collection of inscribed bamboo slips,\nsaid to have been retrieved from overseas. Among them, we find a\nnearly complete version of the Laozi.\n\n\nAlthough the published material to date did not mention any carbon\ndating of the slips, the consensus among the scholars who have worked\nwith them is that they date to the Western Han dynasty. More\nprecisely, based especially on the calligraphic form of the\nwriting\u2014a relatively mature form of the \u201cclerical\u201d\nscript established during the Han period\u2014they have been dated to\nthe second half of the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han (141\u201387\nB.C.E.).\n\n\nLike the Mawangdui silk manuscripts, the Peking University text, now\nreferred to as the \u201cBeida Laozi,\u201d is divided into\ntwo parts. They are titled \u201cLaozi Classic, Part 1\u201d\n(Laozi shang jing) and \u201cLaozi Classic, Part 2\u201d\n(Laozi xia jing). This indicates that not only\nthe Laozi was divided into two parts during the Western Han\nperiod, but also it was accorded the status of a \u201cclassic\u201d\n(jing), which may give some credence to the traditional claim\nthat the Laozi achieved canonical status during the preceding\nreign of Emperor Jing (156\u2013141 B.C.E.).\n\n\nThe Beida Laozi agrees with the Mawangdui manuscripts in\nanother important respect; that is, Part 1 also corresponds to\nchapters 38\u201381 of the current 81-chapter version, or\nthe Dejing, and Part 2, chapters 1\u201337,\nor Daojing. Although this cannot be taken to mean that\nthe Laozi was \u201coriginally\u201d written in that order,\nit may be the case that this was the dominant textual tradition during\nthe Han period. Like the Mawangdui manuscripts, the\nBeida Laozi also records the number of characters at the end\nof each part.\n\n\nIn terms of wording, the Beida Laozi agrees with the\nMawangdui manuscripts in many instances, although in some places it\nagrees rather with that of the received text. For example, whereas\nChapter 22 of the received text describes the sage as a\n\u201cmodel\u201d (shi) for the world, the\nBeida Laozi agrees with the Mawangdui versions in likening\nthe sage more concretely to a \u201cshepherd\u201d\n(mu). However, the Beida text agrees with the standard version\nat the beginning of Chapter 2, as opposed to the shorter formulation\nfound in the Guodian and Mawangdui versions.\n\n\nWhat is equally significant is that the sequence or order of the\nchapters is exactly the same as that in the received Laozi.\nThe difference lies in the division of some of the chapters.  Chapters\n17\u201319 of the received text form one chapter in the\nBeida Laozi. The same is true for chapters 6\u20137, 32\u201333 and\n78\u201379. However, the current chapter 64 appears as two chapters in the\nBeida slips.  Altogether there are 77 chapters.  Each chapter is\nclearly marked, with a round dot at the start, and each chapter starts\non a separate bamboo slip.\n\n\nThe Beida Laozi is almost intact in its entirety, missing\nonly some 60 characters when compared with the received text. While it\noffers fresh glimpses into the development of the text, it does not\nprovide any significant new insight into the meaning of\nthe Laozi. A series of articles on the Peking University\nbamboo slips were published in the journal Wenwu (2011,\nno. 6).  The Beida Laozi was published in December 2012 and\nlaunched in February 2013. Although the majority of scholars accept\nthe authenticity of the find, a notable critic is Xing Wen, who argues\nstrongly that it is a forgery (Xing 2016; for a critical discussion in\nEnglish, see Foster 2017).\n\n\nIn summary, two approaches to the making of the Laozi warrant\nconsideration, for they bear directly on interpretation.\n\n\nA linear \u201cevolutionary\u201d model of textual formation would\nsuggest that the earliest sayings attributed to Laozi address\nprincipally issues of governance, reflecting a deep concern with the\ndecline of Zhou rule. Some of these sayings were preserved in the\nGuodian bamboo texts.\n\n\nOn this view, the Laozi underwent substantial change and grew\ninto a longer and more complex work during the third century B.C.E.,\nbecoming in this process more polemical against the Confucian and\nother schools of thought, and acquiring new material of stronger\nmetaphysical or cosmological interest. The Mawangdui manuscripts were\nbased on this mature version of the Laozi; the original\nemphasis on politics, however, can still be detected in the placement\nof the Dejing before the Daojing. Later versions\nreversed this order and in so doing subsumed politics under a broader\nphilosophical vision of Dao as the beginning and end of all\nbeings.\n\n\nAs distinguished from a linear evolutionary model, what is suggested\nhere is that there were different collections of sayings attributed to\nLaozi, overlapping to some extent but each with its own emphases and\npredilections, inhabiting a particular interpretive context.\n\n\nAlthough some key chapters in the current Laozi that deal\nwith the nature of Dao (e.g., chs. 1, 14) are not found in the Guodian\ncorpus, the idea that the Dao is \u201cborn before heaven and\nearth,\u201d for example, which is found in chapter 25 of the\nreceived text is already present. The critical claim that \u201cbeing\n[you] is born of nonbeing [wu]\u201d in chapter 40\nalso figures in the Guodian \u201cA\u201d text. This seems to argue\nagainst the suggestion that the Laozi, and for that matter\nancient Chinese philosophical works in general, were not interested or\nlacked the ability to engage in abstract philosophic thinking, an\nassumption that sometimes appears to underlie evolutionary approaches\nto the development of Chinese philosophy.\n\n\nAnother Guodian document, given the title \u201cTaiyi\nshengshui\u201d (\u201cThe Great One Gives Birth to the\nWaters,\u201d translated in Ames and Hall 2003; also see Boltz 1999\nand Allan 2003) and which may have formed an integral part of the\nGuodian Laozi \u201cC\u201d text, certainly reflects strong\ninterest in cosmogony and cosmology. The text known as \u201cHeng\nXian,\u201d one of the documents found in the corpus of bamboo slips\nrecovered by the Shanghai Museum in 1994 and which I interpret in the\nsense of that which comes before and determines the created order,\ntestifies further to the active engagement with cosmological and\nmetaphysical questions in early China (Ma Chengyuan 2003; a special\nissue of the journal Dao 12.2, 2013 is devoted to this\nwork).\n\n\nThe Guodian and Mawangdui finds are extremely valuable. They are\nsyntactically clearer than the received text in some instances, thanks\nto the larger number of grammatical particles they\nemploy. Nevertheless, they cannot resolve all the controversies and\nuncertainties surrounding the Laozi. In my view, the nature\nof Dao and the application of Daoist insight to ethics and governance\nprobably formed the twin foci in collections of Laozi sayings from the\nstart. They were then developed in several ways\u2014e.g., some\ncollections were combined; new sayings were added; and explanatory\ncomments, illustrations, and elaboration on individual sayings were\nintegrated into the text. The demand for textual uniformity rose when\nthe Laozi gained recognition, and consequently the different\ntextual traditions eventually gave way to the received text of\nthe Laozi.\n\n\nAs mentioned, the current Laozi on which most reprints,\nstudies and translations are based is the version that comes down to\nus along with the commentaries by Wang Bi and Heshanggong. Three\npoints need to be made in this regard.\n\n\nFirst, technically there are multiple versions of the Wang Bi and\nHeshanggong Laozi\u2014over thirty Heshanggong versions are\nextant\u2014but the differences are on the whole minor. Second, the\nWang Bi and Heshanggong versions are not the same, but they are\nsufficiently similar to be classified as belonging to the same line of\ntextual transmission. Third, the Wang Bi and Heshanggong versions that\nwe see today have suffered change. Prior to the invention of printing,\nwhen each manuscript had to be copied by hand, editorial changes and\nscribal errors are to be expected. In particular, the Laozi\ntext that now accompanies Wang Bi\u2019s commentary bears the imprint of\nlater alteration, mainly under the influence of the Heshanggong\nversion, and cannot be regarded as the Laozi that Wang Bi\nhimself had seen and commented on. Boltz (1985) and Wagner (1989) have\nexamined this question in some detail.\n\n\nThe \u201ccurrent\u201d version refers to the Sibu beiyao\nand the Sibu congkan editions of\nthe Daodejing. (The Sibu beiyao and Sibu\ncongkan are large-scale reproductions of traditional Chinese\ntexts published in the early twentieth century.) The former contains\nthe Wang Bi version and commentary, together with a colophon by the\nSong scholar Chao Yuezhi (1059\u20131129), a second note by Xiong Ke\n(ca. 1111\u20131184), and the Tang scholar Lu Deming\u2019s\n(556\u2013627) Laozi yinyi (Glosses on the Meaning and\nPronunciation of the Laozi). It is a reproduction of the Qing\ndynasty \u201cWuying Palace\u201d edition, which in turn is based on\na Ming edition (see especially Hatano 1979).\n\n\nThe Heshanggong version preserved in the Sibu congkan series\nis taken from the library of the famous bibliophile Qu Yong\n(fl. 1850). According to Qu\u2019s own catalogue, this is a Song dynasty\nversion, published probably after the reign of the emperor Xiaozong\n(r. 1163\u20131189). Older extant Heshanggong versions include two\nincomplete Tang versions and fragments found in Dunhuang.\n\n\nBesides the Guodian bamboo texts, the Mawangdui silk manuscripts, the\nBeida Laozi and the received text of Wang Bi and Heshanggong,\nthere is an \u201cancient version\u201d (guben) edited by\nthe early Tang scholar Fu Yi (fl. 600). Reportedly, this version was\nrecovered from a tomb in 574 C.E., whose occupant was a consort of the\nChu general Xiang Yu (d. 202 B.C.E.), the rival of Liu Bang before the\nlatter emerged victorious and founded the Han dynasty. A later\nredaction of the \u201cancient version\u201d was made by Fan\nYingyuan in the Song dynasty. There are some differences, but these\ntwo can be regarded as having stemmed from the same textual\ntradition.\n\n\nManuscript fragments discovered in the Dunhuang caves form another\nimportant source in Laozi research. Among them are several\nHeshanggong fragments (especially S. 477 and S. 3926 in the Stein\ncollection, and P. 2639 in the Pelliot collection) and the\nimportant Xiang\u2019er Laozi with commentary. Another Dunhuang\nmanuscript that merits attention is the \u201cSuo Dan\u201d\nfragment, now at the University Art Museum, Princeton University,\nwhich contains the last thirty-one chapters of the Daodejing\nbeginning with chapter 51 of the modern text. It is signed and dated\nat the end, bearing the name of the third-century scholar and diviner\nSuo Dan, who is said to have made the copy, written in ink on paper,\nin 270 C.E. According to Rao Zongyi (1955), the Suo Dan version\nbelongs to the Heshanggong line of the Laozi text. William\nBoltz (1996), however, questions its third-century date and argues\nthat the fragment in many instances also agrees with the Fu Yi\n\u201cancient version.\u201d\n\n\nWhile manuscript versions inform textual criticism of\nthe Laozi, stone inscriptions provide further collaborating\nsupport. Over twenty steles, mainly of Tang and Song origins, are\navailable to textual critics, although some are in poor condition (Yan\n1957). Students of the Laozi today can work with several\nChinese and Japanese studies that make use of a large number of\nmanuscript versions and stone inscriptions (notably Ma 1965, Jiang\n1980, Zhu 1980, and Shima 1973). Boltz (1993) offers an excellent\nintroduction to the manuscript traditions of\nthe Laozi. Wagner (2003) attempts to reconstruct the original\nface of Wang Bi\u2019s Laozi (cf. Lou 1980 and Lynn 1999). A major\ncontribution to Laozi studies in Chinese is Liu Xiaogan 2006,\nwhich compares the Guodian, Mawangdui, Fu Yi, Wang Bi, and Heshanggong\nversions of the Laozi and provides detailed textual and\ninterpretive analysis for each chapter. In an article in English, Liu\n(2003) sets out some of his main findings.\n4. Commentaries\n\n\nCommentaries to the Laozi offer an invaluable guide to\ninterpretation and are important also for their own contributions to\nChinese philosophy and religion.\n\n\nTwo chapters in the current Hanfeizi (chs. 21 and 22) are\nentitled \u201cExplaining (the Sayings of) Laozi\u201d\n(Jie Lao) and \u201cIllustrating (the Sayings\nof) Laozi\u201d (Yu Lao), which can be regarded as\nthe earliest extant commentary to the classic (for a detailed study\nand translation, see Sarah A. Queen 2013). The\n\u201cbibliographical\u201d section of the Hanshu (History\nof the Former or Western Han Dynasty) lists four commentaries to\nthe Laozi, but they have not\nsurvived. Nevertheless, Laozi learning began to flourish from\nthe Han period. The commentaries by Heshanggong, Yan Zun, Wang Bi, and\nthe Xiang\u2019er commentary will be introduced in what\nfollows. Some mention will also be made of later developments in the\nhistory of the Daodejing. The late Isabelle Robinet has\ncontributed an important pioneering study of the early Laozi\ncommentaries (1977; see also Robinet 1998).\n\n\nTraditionally, the Heshanggong commentary is regarded as a product of\nthe early Han dynasty. The name Heshanggong means an old man who\ndwells by the side of a river, and some have identified the river in\nquestion to be the Yellow River. An expert on the Laozi, he\ncaught the attention of Emperor Wen, who went personally to consult\nhim. Heshanggong revealed to the emperor his true identity as a divine\nemissary sent by the \u201cSupreme Lord of the Dao\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nthe divine Laozi\u2014to teach him. The emperor proved a humble\nstudent, as the legend concludes, worthy of receiving\nthe Daodejing with Heshanggong\u2019s commentary (A. Chan\n1991).\n\n\nRecent Chinese studies generally place the commentary at the end of\nthe Han period, although some Japanese scholars would date it to as\nlate as the sixth century C.E. It is probably a second-century\nC.E. work and reflects the influence of the \u201cHuang-Lao\u201d\n(Yellow Emperor and Laozi) tradition, which flourished during the\nearly Han dynasty (A. Chan 1991a). Called in early sources\nthe Laozi zhangju, it belongs to the genre\nof zhangju literature, prevalent in Han times, which one may\nparaphrase as commentary by \u201cchapter and sentence.\u201d Its\nlanguage is simple; its imagination, down-to-earth. The Heshanggong\ncommentary shares with other Han works the cosmological belief that\nthe universe is constituted by qi, the energy-like building\nblocks of life and the vital constituent of the cosmos, variously\ntranslated as \u201cvital energy,\u201d \u201clife-force,\u201d or\n\u201cpneuma.\u201d On this basis, interpreting the text in terms of\nyin-yang theory, the Laozi is seen to disclose not only the\nmystery of the origins of the universe but also the secret to personal\nwell-being and sociopolitical order.\n\n\nWhat the Laozi calls the \u201cOne,\u201d according to\nHeshanggong, refers to the purest and most potent form\nof qi-energy that brings forth and continues to nourish all\nbeings. This is the meaning of de, the \u201cvirtue\u201d\nor power with which the \u201cten thousand things\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nall beings\u2014have been endowed and without which life would\ncease.\n\n\nThe maintenance of \u201cvirtue,\u201d which the commentary also\ndescribes as \u201cguarding the One,\u201d is thus crucial to\nself-cultivation. A careful diet, exercise, and some form of\nmeditation are implied, but generally the commentary focuses on the\ndiminishing of selfish desires. The government of the\n\u201csage\u201d\u2014a term common to all schools of Chinese\nthought but which is given a distinctive Daoist meaning in the\ncommentary\u2014rests on the same premise. Policies that are harmful\nto the people such as heavy taxation and severe punishment are to be\navoided, but the most fundamental point remains that the ruler himself\nmust cherish what the Laozi calls \u201cemptiness\u201d and\n\u201cnonaction.\u201d Disorder stems from the dominance of desire,\nwhich reflects the unruly presence of confused and\nagitated qi-energy. In this way, self-cultivation and\ngovernment are shown to form an integral whole.\n\n\nA second major commentary is the Laozi zhigui (The Essential\nMeaning of the Laozi) attributed to the Han dynasty scholar\nYan Zun (fl. 83 B.C.E.\u201310 C.E.). Styled Junping, Yan\u2019s surname\nwas originally Zhuang; it was changed in later written records to the\nsemantically similar Yan to comply with the legal restriction not to\nuse the name Zhuang, which was the personal name of Emperor Ming\n(r. 57\u201375) of the Later or Eastern Han dynasty. Yan Zun is well\nremembered in traditional sources as a recluse of great learning and\nintegrity, a diviner of legendary ability, and an author of\nexceptional talent. The famous Han poet and philosopher Yang Xiong (53\nB.C.E.\u201318 C.E.) studied under Yan and spoke glowingly of\nhim.\n\n\nThe Laozi zhigui (abbreviated hereafter as Zhigui),\nas it now stands, is incomplete; only the commentary to\nthe Dejing, chapters 38\u201381 of the\ncurrent Laozi, remains. The best edition of\nthe Zhigui is that contained in the Daozang (Daoist\nCanon, no. 693 in the Daozang zimu yinde, Harvard-Yenching\nSinological Index Series, no. 25), which clearly indicates that the\nwork had originally thirteen juan or books, the first six of\nwhich have been lost. Judging from the available evidence, it can be\naccepted as a Han product (A. Chan 1998a). The Laozi text\nthat accompanies Yan Zun\u2019s commentary agrees in many instances with\nthe wording of the Mawangdui manuscripts.\n\n\nLike Heshanggong, Yan Zun also subscribes to the yin-yang cosmological\ntheory characteristic of Han thought. Unlike Heshanggong\u2019s commentary,\nhowever, the Zhigui does not prescribe a program of\nnourishing one\u2019s qi endowment or actively cultivating\n\u201clong life.\u201d This does not mean that it rejects the ideal\nof longevity. On the contrary, it recognizes that the Dao \u201clives\nforever and does not die\u201d (8.9b), and that the man of Dao,\ncorrespondingly, \u201cenjoys long life\u201d (7.2a). Valuing one\u2019s\nspirit and vital energy is important, but the Zhigui is\nconcerned that self-cultivation must not violate the principle of\n\u201cnonaction.\u201d Any effort contrary to what\nthe Laozi has termed \u201cnaturalness\u201d\n(ziran) is counter-productive and doomed to failure.\n\n\nThe concept of ziran occupies a pivotal position in Yan Zun\u2019s\ncommentary. It describes the nature of the Dao and its manifestation\nin the world. It also points to an ethical ideal. The way in which\nnatural phenomena operate reflects the workings of the Dao. The\n\u201csage\u201d follows the Dao in that he, too, abides by\nnaturalness. In practice this means attending to one\u2019s\n\u201cheart-mind\u201d (xin) so that it will not be\nenslaved by desire. Significantly, the Zhigui suggests that\njust as the sage \u201cresponds\u201d to the Dao in being simple and\nempty of desire, the common people would in turn respond to the sage\nand entrust the empire to him. In this way, the Laozi is seen\nto offer a comprehensive guide to order and harmony at all levels.\n\n\nAn early commentary that maximizes the religious import of\nthe Laozi is the Xiang\u2019er Commentary. Although it is\nmentioned in catalogues of Daoist works, there was no real knowledge\nof it until a copy was discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts\n(S. 6825 in the Stein collection). The manuscript copy, now housed in\nthe British Library, was probably made around 500 C.E. The original\ntext, disagreement among scholars notwithstanding, is generally traced\nto around 200 C.E. It is closely linked to the \u201cWay of the\nCelestial Masters\u201d and has been ascribed to Zhang Daoling, the\nfounder of the sect, or his grandson Zhang Lu, who was instrumental in\nensuring the group\u2019s survival after the collapse of the Han dynasty. A\ndetailed study and translation of the work in English is now available\n(Bokenkamp 1997).\n\n\nThe Xiang\u2019er manuscript is unfortunately incomplete; only the\nfirst part has survived, beginning with the middle of chapter 3 and\nending with chapter 37 in the current chapter division of\nthe Laozi. It is not clear what the title, Xiang\u2019er,\nmeans. Following Rao Zongyi and \u014cfuchi Ninji, Stephen Bokenkamp\nsuggests that it is best understood in the literal sense that the Dao\n\u201cthinks (xiang) of you (er)\u201d (1997,\n61). This underscores the central thesis of the commentary, that\ndevotion to the Dao in terms of self-cultivation and compliance with\nits precepts would assure boundless blessing in this life and\nbeyond.\n\n\nThe Xiang\u2019er commentary accepts without question the divine\nstatus of Laozi. While Yan Zun and Heshanggong direct their commentary\nprimarily to those in a position to effect political change,\nthe Xiang\u2019er invites a larger audience to participate in the\nquest for the Dao, to achieve union with the Dao through spiritual and\nmoral discipline. It is possible to attain the \u201clife-span of an\nundefiled, godlike being\u201d (xianshou). Nourishing one\u2019s\nvital qi-energy through meditation and other practices\nremains the key to attaining \u201clong life\u201d and ultimately to\nforming a spiritual body devoid of the blemishes of mundane existence\n(Rao 1991; see also Puett 2004).\n\n\nSpiritual discipline, however, is insufficient; equally important is\nthe accumulation of moral merit. Later Daoist sources refer to the\n\u201cnine precepts\u201d of the Xiang\u2019er. There is also a\nlonger set known as the \u201ctwenty-seven precepts\u201d of\nthe Xiang\u2019er. These include general positive steps such as\nbeing tranquil and yielding, as well as specific injunctions against\nenvy, killing, and other morally reprehensible acts. Likening the\nhuman body to the walls of a pond, the essential qi-energy to\nthe water in it, and good deeds the source of the water,\nthe Xiang\u2019er commentary makes clear that deficiency in any\none would lead to disastrous consequences (see Bokenkamp 1993).\n\n\nCompared with the Xiang\u2019er, Wang Bi\u2019s Laozi\ncommentary could not be more different. There is no reference to\n\u201cimmortals\u201d; no deified Laozi. The Daodejing, as\nWang Bi sees it, is fundamentally not concerned with the art of\n\u201clong life\u201d but offers profound insight into the radical\notherness of Dao as the source of being, and the practical\nimplications that follow from it.\n\n\nStyled Fusi, Wang Bi (226\u2013249) was one of the acknowledged\nleaders of the movement of \u201cLearning in the Profound\u201d\n(xuanxue) that came into prominence during the Wei period\n(220\u2013265) and dominated the Chinese intellectual scene well into\nthe sixth century. The word xuan denotes literally a shade of\ndark red and is used in the Laozi (esp. ch. 1) to suggest the\nmystery or profundity of Dao. The movement has been termed, perhaps\nnot without ambiguity, \u201cNeo-Daoism\u201d in Western studies. It\nsignifies a broad philosophical front united in its attempt to discern\nthe \u201ctrue\u201d meaning of Dao but not a homogeneous or\npartisan school. Alarmed by what they saw as the decline of Dao,\ninfluential intellectuals of the day initiated a sweeping\nreinterpretation of the classical heritage. They did not neglect the\nConfucian classics but drew inspiration especially from\nthe Yijing, the Laozi, and the Zhuangzi,\nwhich were then referred to as the \u201cThree (Classics on the)\nProfound\u201d (sanxuan); that is to say, the three key\ntreatises unlocking the mystery of Dao. Wang Bi, despite his short\nlife, distinguished himself as a brilliant interpreter of\nthe Laozi and the Yijing (see A. Chan 1991a, Wagner\n2000, Lynn 2015, and \u201cNeo-Daoism\u201d in\nthis Encyclopedia).\n\n\nAccording to Wang Bi, Dao is indeed the \u201cbeginning\u201d of the\n\u201cten thousand things.\u201d Unlike Heshanggong or\nthe Xiang\u2019er, however, he did not pursue a cosmological or\nreligious interpretation of the process of creation. Rather, Wang\nseems more concerned with what may be called the logic of\ncreation.\n\n\nDao constitutes the absolute \u201cbeginning\u201d in that all\nbeings have causes and conditions that derive logically from a\nnecessary foundation. The ground of being, however, cannot be itself a\nbeing; otherwise, infinite regress would render the logic of\nthe Laozi suspect. For this reason, the Laozi would\nonly speak of Dao as \u201cnonbeing\u201d (wu). We will\ncome back to this point later.\n\n\nThe transcendence of Dao must not be compromised. To do justice to\nthe Laozi, it is also important to show how the function of\nDao translates into basic \u201cprinciples\u201d (li)\ngoverning the universe. The regularity of the seasons, the plenitude\nof nature, and other expressions of \u201cheaven and earth\u201d all\nattest to the presence of Dao. Human beings also conform to these\nprinciples, and so are \u201cmodeled\u201d ultimately after Dao.\n\n\nWang Bi is often praised in later sources for having given the concept\nof li, \u201cprinciple,\u201d its first extended\nphilosophical treatment. In the realm of Dao, principles are\ncharacterized by \u201cnaturalness\u201d (ziran) and\n\u201cnonaction\u201d (wuwei). Wang Bi\ndefines ziran as \u201can expression of the ultimate.\u201d\nIn this regard, attention has been drawn to Yan Zun\u2019s\ninfluence. Nonaction helps explain the practical meaning of\nnaturalness. In ethical terms, Wang Bi takes nonaction to mean freedom\nfrom the dictates of desire. This defines not only the goal of\nself-cultivation but also that of government. The concepts of\nnaturalness and nonaction will be discussed further below. Wang\nBi\u2019s Laozi commentary has exerted a strong influence on\nmodern interpretations of the Laozi in both Asia and the\nWest. There are four English translations available (Lin 1977, Rump\n1979, Lynn 1999, and Wagner 2003).\n\n\nAmong these four commentaries, Heshanggong\u2019s Laozi zhangju\noccupied the position of preeminence in traditional China, at least\nuntil the Song dynasty. For a long period, Wang Bi\u2019s work was\nrelatively neglected. The authority of the Heshanggong commentary can\nbe traced to its place in the Daoist religion, where it ranks second\nonly to the Daodejing itself. Besides Heshanggong\u2019s work and\nthe Xiang\u2019er, there are two other commentaries, the Laozi\njiejie (Sectional Explanation) and the Laozi neijie\n(Inner Explanation), that are closely associated with religious\nDaoism. Both have been ascribed to Yin Xi, the keeper of the pass who\n\u201cpersuaded\u201d Laozi to write the Daodejing and who,\naccording to Daoist hagiographic records, later studied under the\ndivine Laozi and became an \u201cimmortal.\u201d These texts,\nhowever, only survive in citations (see Kusuyama 1979).\n\n\nFrom the Tang period, one begins to find serious attempts to collect\nand classify the growing number of Laozi commentaries. An\nearly pioneer is the eighth-century Daoist master Zhang Junxiang, who\ncited some thirty commentaries in his study of the Daodejing\n(Wang 1981). Du Guangting (850\u2013933) provided a larger\ncollection, involving some sixty commentaries (Daode zhenjing\nguangshengyi, Daozang no. 725). According to Du, there\nwere those who saw the Laozi as a political text, while\nothers focused on spiritual self-cultivation. There were Buddhist\ninterpreters (e.g., Kum\u0101raj\u012bva and Sengzhao), and there were\nthose who explained the \u201cTwofold Mystery\u201d\n(chongxuan). This latter represents an important development\nin the history of interpretation of the Daodejing (Assandri\n2009).\n\n\nThe term \u201cTwofold Mystery\u201d comes from chapter 1 of\nthe Laozi, where Dao is said to be the mystery of all\nmysteries, in the sense of an incomparably profound reality beyond\nordinary comprehension (xuan zhi you xuan). As a school of\nDaoist learning, \u201cTwofold Mystery\u201d seizes this to be the\nkey to understanding the Laozi. Daoist sources relate that\nthe school goes back to the fourth-century master Sun Deng. Through Gu\nHuan (fifth century) and others, the school reached its height during\nthe Tang period, represented by such thinkers as Cheng Xuanying and Li\nRong in the seventh century. The school reflects the growing\ninteraction between Daoist and Buddhist thought, particularly\nM\u0101dhyamika philosophy. Unlike Wang Bi, it sees\n\u201cnonbeing\u201d as equally one-sided as \u201cbeing\u201d\nwhen applied to the transcendence of Dao. Nonbeing may highlight the\nprofundity or mystery of Dao, but it does not yet reach the highest\ntruth, which according to Cheng Xuanying can be called the \u201cDao\nof Middle Oneness\u201d (Kohn 1992, 144; Assandri 2009, chs. 4 and\n6). Like other polar opposites, the distinction between being and\nnonbeing must also be \u201cforgotten\u201d before one can achieve\nunion with Dao.\n\n\nThe Laozi has been viewed in still other ways. For example, a\nTang commentary by Wang Zhen, the Daodejing lunbing yaoyishu\n(Daozang no. 713), presented to Emperor Xianzong\n(r. 806\u2013820) in 809, sees the text as a treatise on military\nstrategy (Rand 1979\u201380; see also Wang Ming 1984 and Mukai\n1994). The diversity of interpretation is truly remarkable (see\nRobinet 1998 for a typological analysis). The Daodejing was\ngiven considerable imperial attention, with no fewer than eight\nemperors having composed or at least commissioned a commentary on the\nwork. These include Emperor Wu and Emperor Jianwen of the Liang\ndynasty, Xuanzong of the Tang, Huizong of the Song, and Taizu of the\nMing dynasty (see Liu Cunren 1969 for a discussion of the last\nthree).\n\n\nBy the thirteenth century, students of the Daodejing were\nalready blessed, as it were, with an embarrassment of riches, so much\nso that Du Daojian (1237\u20131318) could not but observe that the\ncoming of the Dao to the world takes on a different form each\ntime. That is to say, different commentators were shaped by the spirit\nof their age in their approach to the classic, so that it would be\nappropriate to speak of a \u201cHan Laozi,\u201d\n\u201cTang Laozi,\u201d or\n\u201cSong Laozi,\u201d each with its own agenda\n(Xuanjing yuanzhi fahui, Daozang no. 703).\n5. Approaches to the Laozi\n\n\nIs the Laozi a manual of self-cultivation and government? Is\nit a metaphysical treatise, or does it harbor deep mystical\ninsights?\n\n\nChapter 1 of the current Laozi begins with the famous words:\n\u201cThe Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way.\u201d\nChapter 10 speaks of nourishing one\u2019s \u201csoul\u201d and embracing\nthe \u201cOne.\u201d Chapter 80 depicts the ideal polity as a small\ncountry with few inhabitants.\n\n\nThe Laozi is a difficult text. Its language is often cryptic;\nthe sense or reference of the many symbols it employs remains unclear,\nand there seems to be conceptual inconsistencies. For example, whereas\nchapter 2 refers to the \u201cmutual production of being and\nnonbeing,\u201d chapter 40 declares, \u201cBeing originates in\nnonbeing\u201d (Henricks, trans. 1989). Is it more meaningful to\nspeak of the \u201cworldviews\u201d of the Daodejing,\ninstead of a unified vision?\n\n\nIf the Laozi were an \u201canthology\u201d put together at\nrandom by different compilers over a long period of time, occasional\ninconsistencies need not be an issue. Traditionally, however, this was\nnever a serious option. Most modern studies are equally concerned to\ndisclose the \u201cdeeper\u201d unity and meaning of the\nclassic. While some seek to recover the \u201coriginal\u201d meaning\nof the Laozi, others celebrate its contemporary\nrelevance. Consider, first of all, some of the main modern approaches\nto the Daodejing (cf. Hardy 1998).\n\n\nOne view is that the Laozi reflects a deep mythological\nconsciousness at its core. The myth of \u201cchaos,\u201d in\nparticular, helps shape the Daoist understanding of the cosmos and the\nplace of human beings in it (Girardot 1983). Chapter 25, for example,\nlikens the Dao to an undifferentiated oneness. The myth of a great\nmother earth goddess may also have informed the worldview of the\nLaozi (Erkes 1935; Chen 1969), which explains its emphasis on\nnature and the feminine (Chen 1989). Chapter 6, for example, refers to\nthe \u201cspirit of the valley,\u201d which is also called the\n\u201cmysterious female.\u201d\n\n\nA second view is that the Laozi gives voice to a profound\nmysticism. According to Victor Mair (1990), it is indebted to Indian\nmysticism (see also Waley 1958). According to Benjamin Schwartz\n(1985), the mysticism of the Daodejing is sui\ngeneris, uniquely Chinese and has nothing to do with\nIndia. Indeed, as one scholar suggests, it is unlike other mystical\nwritings in that ecstatic vision does not play a role in the ascent of\nthe Daoist sage (Welch 1965, 60). According to another interpretation,\nhowever, there is every indication that ecstasy forms a part of the\nworld of the Laozi, although it is difficult to gauge the\n\u201cdegree\u201d of its mystical leanings (Kaltenmark 1969, 65). A\nmore recent champion of the mystical view is Harold Roth, who argues\nthat Daoist \u201cinner cultivation\u201d and Indian yoga may be\nsimilar, but \u201cthey are parallel developments in different\ncultures at different times.\u201d (Roth 1999, 137).\n\n\nIt is possible to combine the mystical and mythological\napproaches. Although the presence of ancient religious beliefs can\nstill be detected, they have been raised to a \u201chigher\u201d\nmystical plane in the Laozi (e.g., Ching 1997). Broadly, one\ncould carve out a third category of interpretations that highlights\nthe religious significance of the Laozi, whether in general\nterms or aligned with the tenets of religious Daoism.\n\n\nA fourth view sees the Laozi mainly as a work of philosophy,\nwhich gives a metaphysical account of reality and insight into Daoist\nself-cultivation and government; but fundamentally it is not a work of\nmysticism (W. T. Chan 1963). The strong practical interest of\nthe Laozi distinguishes it from any mystical doctrine that\neschews worldly involvement. In H. G. Creel\u2019s (1977) words, it is\n\u201cpurposive\u201d and not purely\n\u201ccontemplative.\u201d\n\n\nFifth, to many readers the Laozi offers essentially a\nphilosophy of life. Remnants of an older religious thinking may have\nfound their way into the text, but they have been transformed into a\nnaturalistic philosophy. The emphasis on naturalness translates into a\nway of life characterized by simplicity, calmness, and freedom from\nthe tyranny of desire (e.g., Liu Xiaogan 1997). For Roger Ames and\nDavid Hall (2003), indeed, the essence of the Laozi is\n\u201cmaking this life significant.\u201d Unlike the claim that\nthe Laozi espouses a mystical or esoteric teaching directed\nat a restricted audience, this view tends to highlight its universal\nappeal and contemporary relevance.\n\n\nSixth, the Laozi is above all concerned with realizing peace\nand sociopolitical order. It is an ethical and political masterpiece\nintended for the ruling class, with concrete strategic suggestions\naimed at remedying the moral and political turmoil engulfing late Zhou\nChina. Self-cultivation is important, but the ultimate goal extends\nbeyond personal fulfillment (Lau 1963, LaFargue 1992, Moeller\n2006). The Laozi criticizes the Confucian school not only for\nbeing ineffectual in restoring order but more damagingly as a culprit\nin worsening the ills of society at that time. The ideal seems to be a\nkind of \u201cprimitive\u201d society, in the non-pejorative sense\nwhere people would dwell in simplicity, harmony and contentment, not\nfettered by ambition or desire (e.g., Needham 1956).\n\n\nThis list is far from exhaustive; there are other views of\nthe Laozi. Chad Hansen (1992), for example, focuses on the\n\u201canti-language\u201d philosophy of the text. Different\ncombinations are also possible. A. C. Graham, for example, emphasizes\nboth the mystical and political elements, arguing that the\nLaozi was probably targeted at the ruler of a small state\n(1989, 234). For Hans-Georg Moeller (2006), though a work of political\nphilosophy in its original context, the Laozi offers a\npowerful critique of \u201chumanism\u201d that is ethically as\nrelevant then as it is now. The Laozi could be seen as\nencompassing all of the above\u2014such categories as the\nmetaphysical, ethical, political, mystical, and religious form a\nunified whole in Daoist thinking and are deemed separate and distinct\nonly in modern Western thought. Alternatively, coming back to the\nquestion of multiple authorship and coherence, it could be argued that\nthe Laozi contains \u201clayers\u201d of material put\ntogether by different people at different times (Emerson 1995).\n\n\nIs it fair to say that the Laozi is inherently\n\u201cpolysemic\u201d (Robinet 1998), open to diverse\ninterpretations? This concerns not only the difficulty of\nthe Laozi but also the interplay between reader and text in\nany act of interpretation.\n\n\nPolysemy challenges the assertion that the \u201cintended\u201d\nmeaning of the Laozi can be recovered fully. But, it is\nimportant to emphasize, it does not follow that context is\nunimportant, that parameters do not exist, or that there are no checks\nagainst particular interpretations. While hermeneutic reconstruction\nremains an open process, it cannot disregard the rules of\nevidence. Questions of provenance, textual variants, as well as the\nentire tradition of commentaries and modern scholarship are important\nfor this reason. And it is for this same reason that the present\narticle leaves the discussion of the Laozi itself till the\nend. The following presents some of the main concepts and symbols in\nthe Laozi based on the current text, focusing on the key\nconceptual cluster of Dao, de (virtue), ziran\n(naturalness), and wuwei (nonaction). I propose that the two\nreadings represented by the Heshanggong and Wang Bi commentaries both\nbring out important insight from the Laozi.\n6. Dao and Virtue\n\n\nTo begin with Dao, the etymology of the Chinese graph or character\nsuggests a pathway, or heading in a certain direction along a\npath. Most commentators agree in translating dao as\n\u201cway.\u201d In early Chinese literature, dao generally\ndepicts a relatively wide thoroughfare or carriage way, and in some\ncontexts waterways, but it is used also to convey what is deemed the\nright or proper course, and by extension the doctrines or teachings\nthat set forth such a course, or the means and methods that would\nbring it about. Laozi 53, for example, states, \u201cThe\ngreat dao is very even (flat, easy to travel on), but people\nlike (to take) by-ways (jing).\u201d The literal sense\nof dao as a path, contrasted in this instance\nwith jing, a small trail off the main road, is clearly\npreserved here, but it is also easy to see how it can be used as a\nmetaphor, how the extended ethical and spiritual sense of dao\ncomes into the picture.\n\n\nAs a verb, perhaps on account of the directionality\ninvolved, dao also conveys the sense of\n\u201cspeaking.\u201d Thus, the opening phrase of chapter 1, dao\nke dao, literally \u201cDao that can be dao-ed,\u201d is often\nrendered, \u201cThe Way that can be spoken of.\u201d\nBecause dao is paired with \u201cname\u201d (ming)\nin the next line\u2014\u201cming ke ming,\u201d \u201cthe\nname that can be named\u201d\u2014forming a parallel couplet\nconstruction, there is thus reason to interpret the verbal usage in\nthe sense of something verbalized, as opposed to a pathway that is\ntravelled on, trodden, or followed. This is also how most commentators\nin traditional China have understood it: the many normative discourses\nthat clamor to represent the right way are seen to be fickle, partial\nand misleading. In most English translations, the capitalized\nform\u2014\u201cWay\u201d or \u201cDao\u201d (or\n\u201cTao\u201d)\u2014is used, to distinguish it from other usages\nof the term.\n\n\nThe concept of dao is not unique to the Laozi. A key\nterm in the philosophical vocabulary, it informs early Chinese\nphilosophy as a whole. It is interpreted differently, signifying a\nmeans to a higher end in some writings and as an end in itself in\nothers. The Laozi underscores both the ineffability and\ncreative power of Dao. This is distinctive and if one accepts the\nearly provenance of the text, charts a new course in the development\nof Chinese philosophy.\n\n\nThe ineffability of Dao is highlighted in chapter 1: the\n\u201cconstant\u201d (chang, also translated as\n\u201ceternal\u201d\u2014e.g., W. T. Chan 1963) Dao cannot be\ndefined or described; it is \u201cnameless.\u201d Chapter 14 brings\nout clearly that Dao transcends sensory perception; it has neither\nshape nor form. Nameless and formless, Dao can only be described as\nutterly profound, and in this sense \u201cdark\u201d or\n\u201cmysterious\u201d (xuan), or as wu, literally\n\u201cnot having\u201d any name, form, or other characteristics of\nthings (see also chs. 21 and 32). Indeed, though suggestive, the term\n\u201cDao\u201d itself is no more than a symbol\u2014as\nthe Laozi makes clear, \u201cI do not know its name; I style\nit Dao\u201d (ch. 25; see also ch. 34). This suggests a sense of\nradical transcendence, which explains why the Laozi has been\napproached so often as a mystical text.\n\n\nThe concept of wu is difficult and has been translated\nvariously as \u201cnothing,\u201d \u201cnothingness,\u201d or\n\u201cnonbeing.\u201d It marks not only the mystery of Dao but also\nits limitlessness or inexhaustibility (e.g., ch. 4). Names serve to\ndelimit, to set boundaries; in contrast, Dao is without limits and\ntherefore cannot be captured fully by language. This suggests a\npositive dimension to transcendence, which brings into view the\ncreative power of Dao: \u201cAll things under heaven are born of\nbeing (you); being is born of\nwu\u201d (ch. 40). What does this mean?\n\n\nElsewhere in the Laozi, Dao is said to be the\n\u201cbeginning\u201d of all things (chs. 1, 25). Daoist creation\ninvolves a process of differentiation from unity to multiplicity:\n\u201cDao gives birth to One; One gives birth to Two; Two gives birth\nto Three; Three gives birth to the ten thousand things\u201d\n(ch. 42). The text does not indicate tense or spell out what the\nnumbers refer to\u2014is it saying that something called the\n\u201cOne\u201d produced or produces the \u201cTwo\u201d in the\nsense of two other things?\n\n\nThe \u201cnothingness\u201d of Dao helps impose certain constraints\non interpretation. Specifically, the idea of a creator god with\nattributes, like the \u201cLord on High\u201d (Shangdi) in ancient\nChinese religion, does not seem to fit with the emphasis on\ntranscendence.\n\n\nThe dominant interpretation in traditional China is that Dao\nrepresents the source of the original, undifferentiated,\nessential qi-energy, the \u201cOne,\u201d which in turn\nproduces the yin and yang cosmic forces. While the\n\u201clighter,\u201d more rarefied yang energy-stuff rises to form\nheaven, the \u201cheavier\u201d yin solidifies to become earth. A\nfurther \u201cblending\u201d of the two generates a\n\u201charmonious\u201d qi-energy that informs human\nbeings.\n\n\nThis is essentially the reading of the Heshanggong\ncommentary. Although the Laozi may not have entertained a\nfully developed yin-yang cosmological theory, which took shape during\nthe Han period, it does suggest at one point that natural phenomena\nare constituted by yin and yang: the \u201cten thousand things\u201d\nor myriad creatures, as it rather lyrically puts it, \u201ccarry yin\non their backs and embrace yang with their arms\u201d (ch. 42). That\nwhich gave rise to the original qi-energy, however, is\nindescribable. The Laozi calls it Dao, or perhaps more\nappropriately in this context, \u201cthe Dao,\u201d with the\ndefinite article, to signal its presence as the source of the created\norder.\n\n\nIn modern terms, minus the language of yin-yang cosmology, this\ntranslates into an understanding of the Dao as \u201can absolute\nentity which is the source of the universe,\u201d as the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary (online edition, under \u201cTao\u201d)\ndefines it. Not being anything in particular, the Dao may be described\nas \u201cnothing\u201d (wu). However, on this\nreading, wu does not mean \u201cnothingness,\u201d\n\u201cnegativity\u201d or absence in the nihilistic sense, in view\nof the creative power of the Dao.\n\n\nAlternatively, one could argue that Dao signifies a conceptually\nnecessary ontological ground; it does not refer to any indescribable\noriginal substance or energy. \u201cBeginning\u201d is not a term of\ntemporal reference but suggests ontological priority in\nthe Laozi.\n\n\nThe process of creation does proceed from unity to multiplicity, but\nthe Laozi is only concerned to show that \u201ctwo\u201d\nwould be impossible without the idea of \u201cone.\u201d The\nassertion in Laozi 42, \u201cOne gives birth to Two,\u201d\naffirms that duality presupposes unity; to render it as \u201cThe One\ngave birth to the Two\u201d is to turn what is essentially a logical\nrelation into a cosmological event.\n\n\nAs the source of being, Dao cannot be itself a being, no matter how\npowerful or perfect; otherwise, the problem of infinite regress cannot\nbe overcome. For this reason, the Laozi makes use of the\nconcept of wu, \u201cnonbeing,\u201d not to suggest a\nsubstance or something of which nothing can be said, but to signify\nthe conceptual \u201cotherness\u201d and radical transcendence of\nthe ground of being.\n\n\nThis agrees with Wang Bi\u2019s interpretation. If wu points to a\nnecessary ontological foundation, the distinction between\n\u201cDao\u201d and \u201cOne\u201d seems redundant. Commenting on\nchapter 42 of the Laozi, Wang Bi writes, \u201cOne can be\nsaid to be wu\u201d; \u201cOne is the beginning of numbers\nand the ultimate of things\u201d (commentary on ch. 39; see also\nWang\u2019s commentary on the Yijing, trans. in Lynn 1994,\n60). The concept of \u201cOne\u201d and the concept of wu\nthus complement each other in disclosing different aspects of the\nlogic of creation\u2014both unity and nonbeing are necessary for\nunderstanding the generation of beings.\n\n\nComparing the two interpretations, whereas the first,\n\u201ccosmological\u201d reading has to explain the sense in which\nthe Dao can be said to be \u201cnothing,\u201d the second emphasizes\nthe centrality of wu, \u201cnonbeing,\u201d for which\n\u201cDao\u201d is but one designation. For the latter, Dao is\nentirely conceptual, whereas the former envisages the Dao as referring\nto a mysterious substance or energy that brings about the cosmos and\ncontinues to sustain and regulate it. Depending on the\ninterpretation, wu may be translated as \u201cnothing\u201d\nor \u201cnonbeing\u201d accordingly. The latter may be awkward, but\nit serves to alert the reader that the nothingness or emptiness of Dao\nmay not be understood referentially or reduced simply to the fullness\nof qi.\n\n\nIn light of the interest in cosmology during the Warring States\nperiod, the cosmological reading may be privileged, but\nthe Laozi is also open to an ontological interpretation. Both\nare philosophically potent. At one level, the ontological reading may\naccommodate the qi-based yin-yang cosmology, although there\nis significant divergence in the interpretation of the ethics of\nthe Laozi, as we shall see in the next section. In either\ncase, the metaphor of \u201cDao\u201d is apt. It shows that all\nthings are derived ultimately from an absolute\n\u201cbeginning,\u201d in either sense of the word, like the start\nof a pathway. It also suggests a direction to be followed, which\nbrings out the ethical interest of the Laozi.\n\n\nThe Daodejing is concerned with both Dao and de. The\ngraph de has also made it into the Oxford English\nDictionary: \u201cIn Taoism, the essence of Tao inherent in all\nbeings\u201d; \u201cin Confucianism and in extended use, moral\nvirtue.\u201d De has been translated variously as virtue,\npotency, efficacy, integrity, or power (for an etymological study, see\nNivison 1978\u201379, and Hall and Ames 1987, 216).\n\n\nLike Dao, de is a general concept open to diverse\ninterpretation. The Confucian understanding of de is by no\nmeans uniform (A. Chan 2011). While some early Ru scholars emphasize\nin their interpretation of \u201cvirtue\u201d the roles and\nresponsibilities embedded in the network of kinship ties and\nsociopolitical relationships that constitute the ethical realm, others\nfocus on the formation of individual moral character through\nself-cultivation. Confucius may have emphasized the latter, but there\nis ample evidence in the Analects and other Confucian works\ntestifying to the importance of the former as well. The Laozi\nseems to be suggesting a \u201chigher\u201d de against any\nmoral achievement attained through repeated effort (e.g., ch. 38). The\ndifferent translations mentioned above aim at bringing out the\nperceived uniquely Daoist understanding of de.\n\n\nAdmittedly, \u201cvirtue\u201d is ambiguous, and in Latin, as many\nscholars have noted, \u201cvirtus\u201d has more to do with\nstrength and capacity than moral virtues. Nevertheless, there are\nadvantages to translating de as \u201cvirtue,\u201d as it\nkeeps in the foreground that the Laozi is giving new meaning\nto an established concept, as opposed to introducing a new concept not\nfound in other schools of Chinese philosophy. From this perspective,\nboth Laozi and Confucius are interpreters of de-virtue.\n\n\nThe marriage of Dao and de effectively bridges the gap\nbetween transcendence and immanence. Traditional commentaries\nbeginning with the Hanfeizi often play on the homonymic\nrelation between de (virtue) and another graph also\npronounced de, which means to \u201cacquire\u201d or\n\u201cobtain\u201d something. De is thus what one has\n\u201cobtained\u201d from (the) Dao, a \u201clatent power\u201d by\n\u201cvirtue\u201d of which any being becomes what it is (Waley\n1958, 32). In this sense, the Laozi speaks of de as\nthat which nourishes all beings (e.g., ch. 51).\n\n\nWithin these parameters, interpretations of de follow from\nthe understanding of Dao and wu. On the one hand, for\nHeshanggong and other proponents of the cosmological view, what one\nhas obtained from the Dao refers specifically to one\u2019s qi\nendowment, which determines one\u2019s physical, intellectual, affective,\nmoral, and spiritual capacity. Read this way, the\ntitle Daodejing should be translated as the \u201cClassic of\nthe Way and Its Virtue,\u201d given that de is\nunderstood to have emanated from the Dao.\n\n\nOn the other hand, for Wang Bi and others who do not subscribe to a\nsubstantive view of Dao, de represents what is\n\u201cgenuine\u201d or \u201cauthentic\u201d (zhen) in\nhuman beings (e.g., see Wang Bi\u2019s commentary on Laozi chs. 3,\n5, 16, 51). Because wu does not refer to any substance or\ncosmological power, what the Laozi means by de, the\n\u201cvirtue\u201d that one has \u201cobtained\u201d from Dao, can\nonly be understood as what is originally, naturally present in human\nbeings.\n\n\nIn either case, the concept of de emerges as a Daoist\nresponse to the question of human nature, which was one of the most\ncontested issues in early Chinese philosophy. The two readings of\nthe Laozi, despite their differences, agree that it is an\ninherent de that enables a person to conform to the way in\nwhich Dao operates. \u201cVirtue\u201d may be corrupted easily, but\nwhen realized, it radiates the full embodiment of the Dao understood\nin terms of qi on Heshanggong\u2019s view, or the flourishing of\nauthenticity on Wang Bi\u2019s interpretation. As such, Dao points to not\nonly the \u201cbeginning\u201d but also through de the\n\u201cend\u201d of all things.\n7. Naturalness and Nonaction\n\n\nThe Laozi makes use of the concept of ziran,\nliterally what is \u201cself (zi) so (ran),\u201d\nto describe the workings of Dao. As an abstract\nconcept, ziran gives no specific information, except to say\nthat Dao is not derived from or \u201cmodeled\u201d (fa)\nafter anything (ch. 25). However, since \u201cheaven and\nearth\u201d\u2014interpreted as nature in most modern\nstudies\u2014are said to be born of Dao and come to be in virtue of\ntheir de, the Laozi is in effect saying that the\nways of nature reflect the function of Dao.\n\n\nIn a cosmological reading, this suggests an understanding of nature as\ngoverned by the operation of qi energies in an ideal yin-yang\nsystem characterized by harmony and fecundity. As interpreted by Wang\nBi, the Laozi means more generally that there are\n\u201cprinciples\u201d (li) inherent in nature.\n\n\nHuman beings are, in turn, born of heaven and earth and so are\n\u201cmodeled\u201d after them, either in terms of\ntheir qi-constitution or in the sense that they are governed\nalso by the same basic principles. Usually translated as\n\u201cnaturalness\u201d or \u201cspontaneity,\u201d ziran\nthus builds on the concept of de in suggesting not only that\nthe power of Dao finds expression in nature, but also at the practical\nlevel a mode of being and way of action in accordance with the ways of\nnature.\n\n\nNature in the Daoist sense, it is important to note, need not exclude\nthe spiritual and the social. The existence of gods and spirits, which\ncan be understood also as being constituted by qi energies,\nwas hardly questioned in early China. The Laozi makes clear\nthat they, too, stem from Dao and form a part of the order of\nziran (e.g., chs. 39, 60).\n\n \nFurther, nature encompasses not only natural phenomena but also\nsociopolitical institutions. The king clearly occupies a central place\nin the realm of Dao (chs. 16, 25); the family also should be regarded\nas a \u201cnatural\u201d institution (chs. 18, 54). As an ethical\nconcept, ziran thus extends beyond the personal to the\nsociopolitical level. It is worth mentioning that ziran\nremains an influential idea today, especially in conceptions of love,\nbeauty, and one\u2019s attitude toward life and death in Chinese\nthinking.\n\n\nThe concept of wuwei, \u201cnonaction,\u201d serves to\nexplain naturalness in practice. Like \u201cnonbeing,\u201d\n\u201cnonaction\u201d is awkward, and some translators prefer\n\u201cnon-assertive action,\u201d \u201cnon-coercive action\u201d\nor \u201ceffortless action\u201d; but it identifies wuwei\nas a technical term. For this reason, I prefer\n\u201cnonaction,\u201d or better still, retaining wuwei in\nits transliterated form and explaining what it means in\nthe Laozi.\n\nWuwei does not mean total inaction. Later Daoists often\nemphasize the close connection between wuwei and techniques\nof spiritual cultivation\u2014the practice of \u201csitting in\nforgetfulness\u201d (zuowang) and \u201cfasting of the\nmind\u201d (xinzhai) discussed in the Zhuangzi are\nsingled out as prime examples in this regard. In the Laozi,\nwhile meditation and other forms of spiritual practice may be\nenvisaged, the concept of wuwei seems to be used more broadly\nas a contrast against any form of action characterized by self-serving\ndesire (e.g., chs. 3, 37).\n\n\nIt is useful to recall the late Zhou context, where disorder marched\non every front. The Laozi, one assumes, is not indifferent to\nthe forces of disintegration tearing the country asunder, although the\nremedy it proposes is subject to interpretation. The problems of\npolitical decline are traced to excessive desire, a violation\nof ziran. Naturalness encompasses basic human needs, of\ncourse, but these are to be distinguished from desire that fuels and\ninflates self-gratification, which knows no end. Nonaction entails at\nthe personal level simplicity and quietude, which naturally follow\nfrom having few desires. At the political level, the Laozi\ncondemns aggressive measures such as war (ch. 30), cruel punishment\n(ch. 74), and heavy taxation (ch. 75), which reflect but the ruler\u2019s\nown desire for wealth and power. If the ruler could rid himself of\ndesire, the Laozi boldly declares, the world would be at\npeace of its own accord (chs. 37, 57).\n\n\nIn this sense, the Laozi describes the ideal sage-ruler as\nsomeone who understands and follows ziran (e.g., chs. 2, 17,\n64). In this same sense, it also opposes the Confucian program of\nbenevolent intervention, which as the Laozi understands it,\naddresses at best the symptoms but not the root cause of the\ndisease. The Confucian project is in fact symptomatic of the decline\nof the rule of Dao. Conscious efforts at cultivating moral virtues\nonly accentuate the loss of natural goodness, which in its original\nstate would have been entirely commonplace and would not have\nwarranted distinction or special attention (chs. 18, 38). Worse,\nConfucian ethics assumes that learning and moral self-cultivation can\nbring about personal and social improvement. From the Daoist\nperspective, artificial effort to \u201cchange\u201d people,\n\u201cimprove\u201d things or to \u201ccorrect\u201d the order\nof ziran only perpetuates a false sense of self that\nalienates human beings from their inherent \u201cvirtue.\u201d\n\n\nThe concept of nonaction is exceedingly rich. It brings into play a\ncutting discernment that value distinctions are ideological, that\nhuman striving and competitive strife spring from the same\nsource. Nonaction entails also a critique of language and conventional\nknowledge, which to the Daoist sage has become impregnated with\nideological contaminants.\n\n\nThe use of paradoxes in the Laozi especially heightens this\npoint. For example, the person of Dao is depicted as\n\u201cwitless\u201d or \u201cdumb,\u201d whereas people driven by\ndesire appear intelligent and can scheme with cunning (ch. 20). The\nway of learning, as one would normally understand it,\n\u201cincreases\u201d the store of knowledge and adds value to goods\nand services; in contrast, questioning the very meaning of such\nknowledge and value, the Laozi describes the pursuit of Dao\nas constantly \u201cdecreasing\u201d or chipping away at the\nartifice built by desire (ch. 48).\n\n\nDriving home the same point, to cite but one more example,\nthe Laozi states, \u201cThe highest virtue is not virtuous;\ntherefore it has virtue\u201d (ch. 38). In other words, those who\nfully realize \u201cvirtue\u201d in the Daoist sense do not act in\nthe way that men and women of conventional morality typically act or\nare expected to act. Paradoxes of this kind function as a powerful\nrhetorical device, which forces the readers, so to speak, to move out\nof their \u201ccomfort zone,\u201d to wake up from their dogmatic\nslumber, and to take note of the proposed higher truth of Dao (see\nalso, e.g., chs. 41, 45, 56). In this context, one can also understand\nsome of the provocative statements in the Laozi telling the\nruler, for example, to keep the people in a state of\n\u201cignorance\u201d (ch. 65).\n\n\nSome scholars would object that this interpretation misses the\nreligious import of the Daodejing, while others would\nquestion whether it is too eager to defend the philosophical coherence\nof the classic. Perhaps the Laozi in chapter 65 of the\ncurrent text did mean to tell the ruler literally to keep the people\nignorant or stupid for better control, which as a piece of political\nadvice is not exactly extraordinary. The remarks offered here take\nnonaction as central to the Daoist view of life, recognizing that the\nconcept of wuwei does not only initiate a critique of value\nbut also points to a higher mode of knowledge, action, and being.\n\n\nAt the critical level, the Laozi emphasizes the relativity of\nknowledge and value. Things appear big or small, for example, only in\nrelation to other things; knowledge and ignorance are meaningful only\nin relation to each other. Good and bad, being and nonbeing, and other\nopposites should be understood in the same light (ch. 2).\n\n\nDistinctions as such are not necessarily problematic; for example, an\nobject can be described as rare or difficult to find as compared with\nother objects. Problems arise, however, when objects that are rare are\ndeemed more valuable than commonplace objects, when \u201cbig\u201d\nis deemed superior to \u201csmall,\u201d or in general terms when\ndistinctions become a basis for value discrimination. When certain\nthings or features (e.g., precious stones, reputation, being slim,\nskin color) are regarded as \u201cbeautiful\u201d or\n\u201cworthy\u201d\u2014i.e., desirable\u2014other things will\ninevitably be deemed \u201cugly\u201d and \u201cunworthy,\u201d\nwith serious social, economic, and political consequences (ch. 3).\n\n\nThe recognition of the relativity of value does not end in a kind of\nmoral relativism or ethical paralysis. The deconstruction of\nconventional beliefs and values opens the door to deeper reflection on\nthe order of ziran. The Laozi also does not appear\nto be advocating the obliteration of all distinctions, and by\nextension civilization as a whole, in a state of mystical oneness. For\nexample, while there is some concern that technology may bring a false\nsense of progress, the antidote does not lie in a deliberate rejection\nof technology but rather in a life of natural simplicity and\ncontentment that stems from having few desires (ch. 80).\n\n\nIn this way, the apparent conceptual inconsistency in\nthe Laozi can be resolved. On the one hand, there is little\nreason to equate, for example, \u201chardness\u201d with strength\nand assign a higher value to it over \u201csoftness.\u201d However,\nonce such value discrimination is shown to be arbitrary,\nthe Laozi can make use of qualities such as softness,\nweakness or yieldingness (e.g., ch. 78) to intimate the Daoist way of\nlife as grounded in nonaction. In this same way, the Laozi\ncan therefore also speak of Daoist virtue as the \u201chighest\ngood\u201d (ch. 8) and \u201chighest virtue\u201d\n(ch. 38). Wuwei ultimately derives its meaning\nfrom wu, which as an ethical orientation privileges\n\u201cnot having\u201d over the constant strivings of the mundane\nworld. This constitutes a radical critique of a world given to the\npursuit of wealth and power. More important, in being\n\u201cempty,\u201d the person of Dao is shown to be\n\u201cfull\u201d; without desire, he or she is able to rediscover\nthe riches of ziran and finds fulfillment.\n\n\nThe critique of value demonstrates the way in which desire\n(yu) perverts the mind\u2014xin, literally,\n\u201cheart,\u201d but understood as the seat of both cognition and\naffectivity\u2014and colors our judgment and experience of\nreality. Desire is a complex concept. Fundamentally, it depicts the\nmovement of the mind as it is drawn to things it finds agreeable\n(e.g., pleasure) or away from things it dislikes (e.g.,\npain). Phenomenologically, the mind is always in motion. Calmness or\ntranquility of mind does not mean the cessation of all cognitive or\naffective movement. Rather, from this perspective, it is the act of\ndesiring that transgresses the order of nature, resulting in a\nplethora of desires pulling the mind in different directions, that is\nseen to be at the heart of the problem. Nonaction contrasts sharply,\naccording to the Laozi, with the way people typically act in\na world in which the rule of Dao no longer prevails, with profit\nmotives, calculated steps, expectations, longings, regrets, and other\nexpressions of desire. Put differently, nonaction would be\n\u201cnormal\u201d action in the pristine order of nature, in which\nthe mind is at peace, free from the incessant stirring of desire.\n\n\nAs a philosophical concept, wuwei intimates a mode of being\nthat governs existential engagement at all levels, transforming the\nway in which we think, feel, and experience the world. It does not\nstipulate what one ought to do or ought not to do in particular\ncases. Terms such as quietude, emptiness, and simplicity favored by\nthe Laozi describe a general ethical orientation rather than\nspecific practices. Although in following wuwei there are\nthings that a person of Dao naturally would not do (e.g., wage a war\nof aggression), and there is a sense in which doing less may be more\nproductive than self-conscious over-exertion,\nphilosophically wuwei is not about not doing certain things\n(thus, military engagement is not ruled out entirely\u2014e.g., see\nchs. 67, 68, 69) but suggests a reorientation of perception and value\nthat ideally would bring an end to the dominance of desire and a\nreturn to the order of ziran.\n\n\nAgain, nonaction need not exclude spiritual practice\u2014ethics and\nspirituality generally form an integral whole in the Daoist\nframe\u2014rather, the point is that once realized, the\ntransformative power of nonaction would ensure not only personal\nfulfillment but also sociopolitical order. This seems to weigh against\na strictly mystical reading of the Laozi, if mysticism is\nunderstood to entail a kind of personal union with the Dao\ntranscending all political interests. The concept of\n\u201cvirtue,\u201d whether interpreted in terms of authenticity or\nthe purity and fullness of qi-energy, depicts a pristine\nnatural and sociopolitical order in which naturalness and nonaction\nare the norm. The ethics of wuwei rests on this insight.\n\n\nTo elaborate, wuwei as an ethical-spiritual ideal entails\nthat the man of Dao, the sage, would be free from the disquieting\nmovement of desire. This would naturally find expression in a mode of\nbeing and action characterized by not doing certain things (e.g.,\nbinge drinking) or doing less of certain things (e.g., consumption of\nalcohol). This is different from the argument that wuwei\nprescribes not doing or doing less of certain things, if such\nprescription requires deliberate effort. As a guide to recovering or\nattaining that ideal, there may be room for the ruler to impose\nconditions that would lead to a diminishing of desire-driven action;\nbut this is not quite ideal wuwei. Similarly, although it may\nbe said that nonaction points to a state of mind in which one does\neverything that one does, it is on the understanding that in that\nideal state certain actions simply would not occur as a matter of\ncourse, as the mind would not be aroused and move in their\ndirection. For example, to argue that there is a qualitatively\ndifferent wuwei way of stealing or gambling would not be\nmeaningful in the world of the Laozi, because such action\nwould not arise in the ideal realm of naturalness.\n\n\nTo elaborate further, consider the ideal ethical situation in the\ncosmological reading of the Laozi as represented by the\nHeshanggong commentary. The dispensation of qi gives rise to\na pristine hierarchical order in which those who are blessed with a\nperfect qi endowment, the rare sages, would govern the\nmajority. It can be assumed that the sages are naturally predisposed\nto quietude, whereas the common people are driven by desire in varying\ndegree. Indeed, at one point, the Laozi seems to distinguish\nthree different grades of human beings (ch. 41), which on this view\nwould be the result of their unequal qi endowment. The role\nof the sage-ruler, then, would be to guide the people to abide by\nsimplicity through personal charisma and example, and also by means of\npolicies designed to cultivate an environment in which desire would\nnot run rampant. In the absence of a true sage-ruler,\nthe Laozi is saying, according to this interpretation, those\nin power should emulate the Daoist sage, cultivate their\ninternal qi energies, and bring about peace and harmony\nthrough naturalness and nonaction.\n\n\nAn ontological reading can accommodate the theory that heaven and\nearth and the \u201cten thousand things\u201d are all constituted\nby qi. The decisive difference is that on this account, human\nbeings all share the same essential nature, as distinguished from\ntheir qi-constituted capacities. For example, some people may\nbe better endowed and therefore could live to a ripe old age, while\nothers with a poorer endowment may die prematurely; but this does not\ndetract from the fundamental assertion that they share the same\ninherent de, which defines their nature.\n\n\nSages are not a different kind of being, god-like, with a radically\ndifferent nature; rather, they are individuals who manage to realize\ntheir authentic de to the full. Unlike the cosmological\ninterpretation which essentially traces \u201csagehood\u201d to a\nspecial inborn sage-nature, the idea of an authentic ontological core\nassures the possibility of attaining sagehood. Being one with Dao does\nnot describe any mystical union with a divine source or sacred power,\nbut reflects a mode of being that accords with the assumed original\nnature marked by natural goodness and the absence of excessive\ndesire. Because the world is in a state of decline, the Laozi\ntherefore speaks of a \u201creturn\u201d to Dao, to naturalness and\nnonaction.\n\n\nRegardless of the position one takes, in this general interpretive\nframework a number of symbols which both delight and puzzle readers of\nthe Laozi can be highlighted. Suggestive of its creativity\nand nurturance, Dao is likened to a mother (e.g., chs. 1, 25). This\ncomplements the paradigm of the feminine (e.g., chs. 6, 28), whose\n\u201cvirtue\u201d is seen to yield fecundity and to find expression\nin yieldingness and non-contention. The infant (e.g., chs. 52, 55)\nserves as a fitting symbol on two counts. First, it brings out the\nrelationship between Dao and world; second, the kind of innocence and\nwholesome spontaneity represented by the infant exemplifies the\npristine fullness of de in the ideal Daoist world.\n\n\nNatural symbols such as water (e.g., chs. 8, 78) further reinforce the\nsense of yielding and deep strength that characterizes nonaction. The\nlow-lying and fertile valley (e.g., chs. 28, 39) accentuates both the\ncreative fecundity of Dao and the gentle nurturance of its\npower. Carefully crafted and ornately decorated objects are treasured\nby the world, and as such can be used as a powerful symbol for it. In\ncontrast, the utterly simple, unaffected, and seemingly\nvalueless pu, a plain uncarved block of wood, brings into\nsharp relief the integrity of Daoist virtue and of the person who\nembodies it (e.g., chs. 28, 32). Finally, one may mention the notion\nof reversal (e.g., chs. 40, 65), which suggests not only the need to\n\u201creturn\u201d to Dao, but also that the Daoist way of life\nwould inevitably appear the very opposite of \u201cnormal\u201d\nexistence, and that it involves a complete revaluation of values.\n\n\nIn sum, any interpretation of the current Laozi as a whole\nmust take into account (a) the \u201cnothingness\u201d of Dao and\n(b) the way in which wuwei and ziran provide a guide\nto the good life.\n\n\nWith respect to the latter, it is true that in many chapters the text\nseems to be addressing the ruler or the ruling elite, explaining to\nthem the ideal government of the Daoist sage. This is not surprising\ngiven the Zhou context and given that the production of written\ndocuments and the access to them were generally the preserve of the\nruling class in ancient China. However, this need not restrict\ninterpretation to politics in the narrow sense of statecraft or\npolitical strategies. In the light of the emphasis on\nziran and wuwei, there is sufficient evidence that\nthe Laozi views politics in a larger ethical-spiritual\ncontext, in which the flourishing of sociopolitical order is rooted in\nself-cultivation.\n\n\nIn the final analysis, naturalness and nonaction are seen to reflect\nthe function of the nameless and formless Dao. As such, Daoist ethical\nideals are anchored in a non-empirical, idealized view of\nnature. Specifically, the ethics of the Laozi rests on the\nunderstanding that de is inherent in nature, or better, the\nDaoist world. It is on this basis that the concept of de is\nraised to a higher level than \u201cvirtues\u201d in the sense of\nmoral attainments. Perhaps for this reason, the Laozi did not\nresort to the language of \u201chuman nature\u201d (xing)\ncommonly employed in early Chinese philosophy.\n\n\nThe understanding of de, however, is dependent on that of\nDao, which in turn hinges on the interpretation of wu as\neither original substance or nonbeing. Both readings are plausible and\nare within the semantic range of the Laozi. Whereas the\nformer subscribes to the prevalent qi theory that underlies\nmuch of Chinese philosophy and on that basis provides an integrated\nview of the cosmos, self-cultivation and government, the latter\nfocuses on the fundamental unity of being characterized by natural\nsimplicity and quietude that ideally should define the ethical course\nfor both the individual and society.\n\n\nThe Laozi should be recognized as a seminal work. It is\nprofoundly insightful; but it is the task of the interpreter to work\nout the full implications of its often provocative insight. It seems\nreasonable to assume that while the Laozi has something new\nto offer, it nonetheless shares certain background ideas and\nassumptions with other early Chinese philosophical texts. As such, the\ncosmological interpretation should be given due\nconsideration. However, in bringing into view the nothingness of Dao\nand the order of ziran, the Laozi invites reflection\non the very core of being beyond any cosmological assumptions. While\nthe production of meaning is context dependent, new horizons do emerge\nfrom great works of philosophy. The two lines of interpretation\noutlined here have different ethical implications regarding the nature\nof the ideal sage, but neither can be said to have transgressed the\nhermeneutic boundaries of the Daodejing. The suggestion that\nthey both arise from the Laozi is not a matter of\nequivocation but an acknowledgement of its hermeneutical depth (for a\ngood set of essays incorporating the latest scholarship on\nthe Laozi, see Liu 2015).\n\n\nThe power of the Daodejing does not lie in a clearly laid out\nset of doctrines, but in its seminal insights. The concept\nof qi may be culture specific, and the prospects of realizing\nuniversal Daoist order may seem remote, but the recognition of the\nfundamental problem of desire should still give us pause. The ills of\ndiscrimination, exploitation and intellectual hubris, so deeply\nembedded in language and value systems, remain as serious today as\nthey were in early China. The healing power of nonaction still strikes\na chord and commands continuing reflection and engagement. Although in\nworking out these insights differences will no doubt arise, they unite\nall interpreters of the Laozi and draw new generations of\nreaders into the mystery of Dao and (its) virtue.\n",
