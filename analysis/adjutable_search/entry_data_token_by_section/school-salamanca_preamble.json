    "main_text": "\n\nThe School of Salamanca is a name for an intellectual movement or a\ncertain group of theologians in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century\nSpain and Portugal. In a broad sense, it is more or less identical\nwith Spanish Scholasticism, which also includes authors from the\nSpanish Netherlands. In a narrower sense, the School of Salamanca\nrefers to two or three generations of pupils of Francisco de Vitoria,\nwho was, in effect, the founding father of the school in both the\nbroad and narrow sense. On the whole, it is more useful to choose the\nbroader understanding of the term, even though it means considering\nsome figures who were never at Salamanca; and this approach has been\nadopted here. Regarded as forefathers of the law of nations (ius\ngentium), they also were theoreticians willing to depart from the\nteachings of Aristotle, and some of them were early theorists of\nmonetarist economics. They based themselves on the works of Thomas\nAquinas but felt free to depart from them, especially in dealing with\ncontemporary issues like Spanish expansion in the Indies and the\nchallenge of Protestantism to Catholic Christianity.\n",
