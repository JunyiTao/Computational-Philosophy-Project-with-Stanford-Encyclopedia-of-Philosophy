    "main_text": "Emotions and Qing in Early Chinese Philosophy || Semantic Dimensions of Qing\n2.3 Semantic Dimensions of Qing\n\nUnderneath the polysemy of qing, there are two semantic\ndimensions: one is the ontological and objective dimension\n(qing as nature, essence, or reality) and the other is the\npsychological and subjective dimension (qing as inner\nfeelings or subjective emotions). Regarding the two semantic\ndimensions of qing, Bruya (2003: 157) states that \n\n\nqing carried a range of meaning, from mere facts on one end\nof a spectrum, to pure emotion on the other. \n\n\nThe two seemingly contrastive or even conflicting semantic dimensions\ncaught the academic interest of many sinologists and comparative\nphilosophers. Why does qing have the seemingly contrastive or\nconflicting meanings? Are the two semantic dimensions incompatible\nwith each other? What is the conceptual or philosophical foundation of\nqing\u2019s polysemy? The polysemy of qing will\nguide us to discover the underlying conceptual foundations of emotions\nin early Chinese philosophy, specifically its diverse viewpoints on\nthe affective nature of the mind.\n",
