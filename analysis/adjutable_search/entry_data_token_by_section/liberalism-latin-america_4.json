Liberals, Conservatives, and the Religious Problem\n\nWhat gave Latin American liberals and liberalism a clear identity\naround the mid-nineteenth century was their opposition to an\nadversary. In most of Hispanic America there emerged a\n\u201cconservative\u201d reaction against the dominant liberal tide\nas well as the political and social instability that\ncharacterized the initial constitutional experiments. A salient\nexception to this general trend is Argentina where liberals faced no\nsuch strong opposition and the liberal identity was for this reason\nless clearly defined (Halper\u00edn Donghi 1988). Though liberals\nand conservatives shared some political ground, the latter were\nusually the champions of order and stability, favoring gradual social\nchange and the preservation of traditional hierarchies and privileges\n\u2013 including those historically enjoyed by the Catholic Church.\nLiberals, by contrast, favored a faster pace of change, the full\nprotection of individual liberties, and the dismantling of the\nChurch\u2019s privileges and immunities. In Hispanic America,\nliberals and conservatives agreed on the need for a written\nconstitution, the conventional nature of political authority,\nindividual representation, and the separation of powers, among other\nideas. In Brazil, the two political groups agreed on monarchical rule,\nthough conservatives favored political centralism, the maintenance of\noligarchical privilege, limited political participation, and also\nopposed the emancipation of slaves. By contrast, Brazilian liberals\nfavored more provincial autonomy, political participation, religious\nfreedom, secularization, and the end of slavery and of oligarchical\nprivilege (Viotti da Costa 1986). Radical Brazilian liberals founded a\nrepublican party that called for the end of the monarchical system and\nthe abolition of nobility titles.\n\nIn Hispanic America, what in particular was meant by\n\u201cconservatism\u201d varied across the region depending on what\nwas politically at stake. In Chile, where the conservatives had been\nsuccessful in maintaining order and economic prosperity (1831\u20131861),\n\u201cconservatism\u201d primarily meant authoritarian and\ncentralized rule. Correspondingly, liberals pressed for the full\nprotection of individual freedoms, parliamentary limits to executive\npower, and wider political participation. The 1833 Chilean\nconservative Constitution, which established a strong presidency,\nofficial religious intolerance, and a highly centralist system,\nremained in force for almost a full century and was often praised as a\nmodel for neighboring republics. Though Chilean liberals were\nanti-clerical while conservatives were not, the religious issue was\nnot as divisive in view of the relative weakness of the Catholic\nChurch. By contrast, in Colombia, where the Catholic Church had deeper\nroots, conservatism also meant, in addition to authoritarian and\ncentralist rule, a strong pro-clericalism that advocated a central\nplace for Catholicism and the Catholic Church in the republican order.\nThus, the identity of Colombian liberals correspondingly centered on a\ncombination of profound anti-clericalism with a defense of individual\nliberties and federalism. The Colombian 1853 liberal constitution\nabolished slavery and established religious freedom and the right to\ndivorce. The more radical Rionegro constitution of 1863 confiscated\nChurch property, established absolute freedom of the press, took\nfederalism to the extreme (more so than any other constitution in the\nAmericas; Bushnell 1993: 181), and limited the presidency to a two\nyear term without the possibility of immediate reelection. Chilean\nliberals took control of government in 1870 and were able to deepen\nthe process of secularization. By contrast, Colombian conservatives\nwon out in 1885 and remained in power until 1930. The 1886\nconservative Colombian constitution remained in force until 1991 with\nits strong centralism and privileging of the Catholic Church.\n\nWhile all conservatives in Hispanic America favored a strong and\ncentralized rule that could maintain peace and political stability,\nand also opposed the full protection of individual freedoms, they did\nnot look back in nostalgia to the destroyed colonial and Catholic\norder, arguably with the exception of Lucas Alam\u00e1n in Mexico\nwho also favored a return to monarchism (Collier 2003: 123), Nor did\nthey confer the Catholic church a central place in the new republican\norder, again with the exception of Alam\u00e1n but also of Miguel\nAntonio Caro in Colombia, and Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno in Ecuador.\nWhile the liberal forces of secularization had won out in most of the\nregion by the end of the century, the confrontation between liberals\nand conservatives played out in Colombia until the end of the\ntwentieth (Del Par 2010). Though the difference between liberals and\nconservatives was sometimes not clear cut, it has been maintained that\nthe only issue that consistently placed them at opposite sides in\nHispanic America was the religious one (Bushnell 1996, 288\u2013289).\n\nThe religious problem in Hispanic America was, in some regions,\nprimarily about religious toleration and individual rights, where the\nliberal position regarding religion centered on the demand for freedom\nof religious worship. This was the case in Argentina where the local\nCatholic Church was relatively weak. By contrast, in some other\nregions, such as Mexico or Colombia, where the church was much\nstronger, the religious problem was more complex and not merely a\nmatter of individual rights insofar as the church was powerful enough\nto destabilize the new republican governments and to challenge their\nlegitimacy. Where it had the power to do so, the church sought to\nmobilize the moral religious sensibilities of the majority of the\npopulation against the attempted liberal reforms. The church opposed\ncivil equality in order to protect its own legal privileges and\nimmunities, rejected the freedoms of thought and of the press as\nthreats to religious morality and clerical authority, fought against\neconomic reforms that endangered its position as the largest landowner\nand wealthiest corporation, favored a form of government that mirrored\nits own hierarchical structure (i.e., absolute monarchism), and sought\nto maintain official recognition and support by the state. The\nchallenge posed by the church to the new liberal republics combined\nclaims to political and economic power with the defense of morality\nand religion. In sum, the church opposed all aspects of liberal\nideology in the name of the religion of the vast majority. By contrast\nwith France at the time, liberal Catholicism did not develop in the\nAmericas.\n\nThough liberals and conservatives could agree on the need to protect\nfreedom of religious worship, as sometimes they did, they held\nopposing views regarding the sorts of institutional supports, if any,\nthat the State ought to provide to the dominant Catholic Church.\nLiberals favored the abolition of the church\u2019s privileges and\nimmunities in the name of legal equality, various degrees of exclusion\nof the church from official schooling, the establishment of a civil\nregistry and civil matrimony, the possibility of divorce, and the\nsecularization of hospitals and cemeteries. In the name of economic\nprogress and freedom, liberals sometimes advocated the confiscation of\nchurch property not directly related to religious worship in order to\nmake it available for in the market. In places where the conflict with\nthe church was most profound liberals pushed for the complete\nseparation between church and state as well as the\n\u201cneutrality\u201d of the state in religious matters. The latter\nmeant that the state should not explicitly favor or disfavor religion\nas such. This liberal position, though clearly anti-clerical, did not\nnecessarily entail hostility to religion. Though some liberals\nundoubtedly held anti-Catholic sentiments, the attack against the\nchurch was political insofar as it aimed to place the latter under the\nauthority of the state. Conservatives, in turn, defended the\nprivileges traditionally enjoyed by the church, which included\nestablishment and the church\u2019s alleged duty to spread religious\nmorality through official schooling. They also opposed the\nconfiscation of church property. Though some conservatives favored the\nchurch from authentic conviction (such as Miguel Antonio Caro in New\nGranada, the most prominent conservative intellectual there), many of\nthem did so from instrumental considerations. Conservative\npoliticians did not wish to antagonize what could be a useful\nally in the maintenance of order. This pragmatic view was Diego\nPortales\u2019, the architect of Chilean political stability (Collier\n2003), and apparently also Lucas Alam\u00e1n\u2019s, who famously\nreferred to Catholicism as \u201cthe only link that binds all\nMexicans when all others have been broken\u201d (Safford 1987: 100).\nIn the long run, those regimes that contemporized with the church\nindeed proved to be more stable than the liberal ones that antagonized\nit.\n",
