    "main_text": "The Middle Wittgenstein\n5. After the Investigations\n\nIt has been submitted that the writings of the period from 1946 until\nhis death (1951) constitute a distinctive phase of\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought. These writings include, in addition to\nthe second part of the first edition of the Philosophical\nInvestigations (PPF), texts edited and collected in volumes such\nas Remarks on Colour, Remarks on the Philosophy of\nPsychology, Zettel, On Certainty, and parts of\nRemarks on the Foundations of Mathematics.\n\nPart II of the Philosophical Investigations was, in fact, an\nitem of contention ab initio. In Anscombe and Rhees\u2019s\nfirst edition of 1953 (translated by Anscombe), reasons were given for\nincluding it, admittedly as a differentiated part, in the book. In\nHacker and Schulte\u2019s (translated and edited) fourth edition of\n2009, its position was contrarily explained. It now became, instead of\nPart II, an almost independent entity \u2013 Philosophy of\nPsychology \u2013 A Fragment (PPF). It is also emphasized that\nit was a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d Be that as it may, that\ninstallment of a post-Philosophical Investigations text\nexhibits all the vagaries of Wittgensteinian interpretation \u2013\nbehooving philosophers to attend to questions of placement (which\nWittgenstein is here represented, middle, later, or other?), affinity\n(how do these comments relate to Wittgenstein\u2019s later work in\ngeneral?), and topic (what is Wittgenstein dealing with here,\npsychology, epistemology, or the method of philosophy?).\n\nPPF is the locus classicus of a key Wittgensteinian term\n\u2013 \u201cseeing aspects\u201d (PPF xi), where\n\u201ctwo uses of the word \u2018see\u2019\u201d are elaborated.\nThe second use, where one \u201csees\u201d a likeness in two\nobjects, is the one that has given rise to the question of aspect\nperception and the attendant phenomena of aspect-dawning and change of\naspect. \u201cI observe a face, and then suddenly notice its likeness\nto another. I see that it has not changed; and yet I see it\ndifferently. I call this experience \u2018noticing an\naspect\u2019\u201d (113). Aspect seeing involves noticing something\nabout an object \u2013 an aspect of the object \u2013 that one\nhadn\u2019t noticed before and thereby seeing it as something\ndifferent. Importantly, it also arises as a result of a change of\ncontext of our perceptions. This immensely insightful discovery by\nWittgenstein, and its successive development, has been the source of a\nmultitude of discussions dealing with questions of objectivity vs.\nsubjectivity, conception vs. perception, and psychology vs.\nepistemology. It also highlights the move from dogmatic, formalistic\nuniversalism to open, humanistic context-laden behavior, aptly\nreverberating in the to-and-fro of seeing aspects.\n\nOn Certainty is generally accepted as a work of epistemology, as\nopposed to PPF, which is usually recognized as dealing with\npsychology (though even that distinction is called into question by\nsome interpretations). It tackles skeptical doubts and foundational\nsolutions but is, in typical Wittgensteinian fashion, a work of\ntherapy which discounts presuppositions common to both. As always\nbefore in the interpretative game, the general view sees Wittgenstein\nas landing on the non-skeptical side of the epistemological debate,\nchoosing instead to peruse \u201chinge propositions.\u201d These are\npropositions about which doubt cannot be entertained, but whether this\nbe due to their being epistemically foundational, naturally certain,\nor logically unavailable to doubt is still a matter for philosophical\nexplanation; as is the question of Wittgenstein\u2019s object of\ncritique \u2013 Cartesian or radical skepticism \u2013 or, in some\nquarters, the very assumption of his unequivocal anti-skepticism. This\nis intimately related to another of On Certainty\u2019s\nthemes\u2014the primacy of the deed to the word, or, in\nWittgenstein\u2019s PI terminology, of form of life to\nlogos. Such a clearly delineated philosophical phase has garnered the\nrecognition of a \u201cthird Wittgenstein\u201d (initially by\nDani\u00e8le Moyal-Sharrock).\n\nRemarks on Colour is a collection of remarks, composed by\nWittgenstein during the last year and a half of his life. In these\nremarks he attempts to clarify the language we use in describing our\nexperience and impression of colours, sameness of colours, saturated\ncolours, light and shade, brightness and opaqueness of surfaces,\ntransparency, etc. These reflections present us with a \u201cgeometry\nof colours,\u201d though Wittgenstein makes it clear that due to\n\u201cthe indefiniteness in the concept of colour\u201d (III-78) the\n\u201clogic of colour concepts\u201d (I-22) should be given\npiecemeal. When we consider colours \u201cthere is merely an\ninability to bring the concepts into some kind of order\u201d\n(II-20). Philosophical attention should be given rather to such\nparticularities as the blending in of white (as opposed to blending in\nyellow), \u201cthe coloured intermediary between two colours\u201d\n(III-49), \u201c the difference between black-red-gold and\nblack-red-yellow\u201d (III-51), etc. The investigation is therefore\ndirected not merely to colour phenomena and the language we use to\ndescribe them but also to philosophical methodology, in comparison\nwith scientific inquiry, and to what is taken to be conceivable and\nwhat is not. It is also unique in reminding us of a hint, by\nWittgenstein, that it was prompted by Johann Wolfgang von\nGoethe\u2019s Zur Farbenlehre (On the Theory of\nColour, 1810)!\n\nThe general tenor of all the writings of this last period can thence\nbe viewed as, on the one hand, a move away from the critical (some\nwould say destructive) positions of the Investigations to a\nmore positive perspective on the same problems that had been facing\nhim since his early writings; on the other hand, this move does not\nnecessarily bespeak a break from the later period but might be more\nproperly viewed as its continuation, in a new light. In other words,\nthe grand question of interpreting Wittgenstein, i.e., the question of\ncontinuities or breaks, remains at the forefront of understanding\nWittgenstein.\n",
