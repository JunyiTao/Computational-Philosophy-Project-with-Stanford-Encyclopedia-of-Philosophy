Causality, Self-Motion, and the Will\n\n\nAn example of motion in the wider sense is an act of the will: it is\na change of state of some entity (namely the mind or soul), but would\nnot have been thought of as local motion by most medieval\nthinkers \u2013 thought and will were generally regarded as immaterial\nprocesses (see Cross 1999, p. 75).\n\n\nAristotle has a picture of willed action in which actions are caused\nby combinations of beliefs and desires: these belief-desire states are\nnot, of course, themselves actions (Normore 1998). This picture of the\nwill fits with one of Aristotle\u2019s major causal doctrines: that nothing\ncauses a change in itself.\n\n\nHowever, Aristotle\u2019s picture of the will was not undisputed in the\nMiddle Ages: as early as the twelfth century, Anselm had outlined a\ntheory in which the will was a self-mover, and in which moral conflict\nwas explained by the presence of two wills in the same person (Normore\n1998, p. 28). This position was later taken up, in conscious opposition\nto Aristotle, by thinkers in the Franciscan school \u2013 Peter Olivi, and\nthen Scotus and Ockham.\n\n\nScotus follows a modified Anselmian line, speaking of a single will,\nwith two inclinations: one towards self-fulfillment, the other towards\njustice). It is the presence of these two inclinations which\ndistinguishes willed causes from natural causes: natural causes are\ndetermined to perform their acts (unless impeded), whereas the will is\nnot thus determined (Scotus, Metaphysics IV, 9: in Scotus,\nOn the Will and Morality, pp. 136ff.; Lee 1998; Cross 1999,\npp. 84ff.). The will is thus self-determining, rather than determined\nby its end, and so Scotus affirms self-motion in psychology. In fact,\nhe goes further, and admits self-motion in physical cases as well: for\nexample, a falling object is actively moving towards its goal, and its\nmotion is caused by itself (because it is heavy); so this, too, is an\ninstance of self-motion (Effler 1962).\n\n\nOckham expands on Scotus\u2019s theory of the will to deny that actions\nare properly explained by their ends: we are influenced by\nends, but our actions are not necessitated by them and thus\nnot caused by them (Ockham, Quodlibet I, qu. 16: Opera\nTheologica IX, pp. 87ff.). A free agent is one which, under\nexactly the same circumstances, could have chosen otherwise; and so a\nfree agent can reject the Beatific Vision (and, in fact, actively turn\nto any other object whatever). (Ockham, Quodlibet IV, q. 1:\nOpera Theologica IX, pp. 292ff.).\n",
