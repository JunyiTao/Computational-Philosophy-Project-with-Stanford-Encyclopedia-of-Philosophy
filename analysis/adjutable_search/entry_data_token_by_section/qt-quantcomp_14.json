    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions || (Quantum) Computational Perspectives on Physical Science\n5.4 (Quantum) Computational Perspectives on Physical Science\n\nPhysics is traditionally conceived as a primarily\n\u201ctheoretical\u201d activity, in the sense that it is generally\nthought to be the goal of physics to tell us, even if only indirectly\n(Fuchs (2002), pp. 5\u20136, Fuchs (2010), pp. 22\u20133), what the world is\nlike independently of ourselves. This is not the case with every\nscience. Chemistry, for example, is arguably best thought of as a\n\u201cpractically\u201d oriented discipline concerned with the ways\nin which systems can be manipulated for particular purposes\n(Bensaude-Vincent (2009)). Even within physics, there are\nsub-disciplines which are best construed in this way (Myrvold 2011;\nWallace 2014; Ladyman 2018), and indeed, some (though at present these\nare still a minority) have even sought to (re-)characterise physics as\na whole in something like this way, i.e. as a science of possible as\nopposed to impossible transformations (Deutsch 2013).\n\nElaborating upon ideas which one can glean from Pitowsky\u2019s work\n(1990, 1996, 2002), Cuffaro argues at length that quantum computation\nand information theory (QCIT) are practical sciences in this sense, as\nopposed to the \u201ctheoretical sciences\u201d exemplified by\nphysics under its traditional characterisation; further that\nrecognising this distinction illuminates both areas of activity. On\nthe one hand (Cuffaro 2017), practical investigators attempting to\nisolate and/or quantify the computational resources made available by\nquantum computers are in danger of conceptual confusion if they are\nnot cognisant of the differences between practical and traditional\nsciences. On the other hand (Cuffaro 2018a), one should be wary of the\nsignificance of classical computer simulations of quantum mechanical\nphenomena for the purposes of a foundational analysis of the latter.\nFor example, certain mathematical results can legitimately be thought\nof as no-go theorems for the purposes of foundational analysis, and\nyet are not really relevant for the purpose of characterising the\nclass of efficiently simulable quantum phenomena.\n",
