    "main_text": "The Role of Coherence in Legal Reasoning: || Coherence in Legal Reasoning: Necessary, Sufficient or Desirable?\n3.3 Coherence in Legal Reasoning: Necessary, Sufficient or Desirable?\n\n\nOnce a stance has been taken on the nature of the coherence relation in\nthe case of law, many further questions concerning the role which\nconsiderations of coherence are to play in legal reasoning come to the\nfore. One important issue is that of how much emphasis is to be placed\non coherence in justifying a judicial decision. Is exhibiting some\ndegree of coherence with the existing law a necessary requirement of\nany justified judicial decision? Is it both a necessary and sufficient\nrequirement, such that an account of the role of coherence in\nadjudication supplies us with a complete explanation of how judges\nshould decide cases according to law? Or is coherence rather to be\nregarded as a desirable feature of judicial decision making, but one\nwhich can be overridden by other considerations in certain\ncircumstances? \n\n\nAt this point in the discussion, it is possible to draw out some\nfurther possible links between the two concepts with which this entry\nis concerned, namely interpretation and coherence. If we hold that\nlegal reasoning in sense (b), namely reasoning from the content of the\nlaw to the outcome which judges should adopt in a case before them, is\nwholly (Dworkin 1986) or mainly (Raz 1996a) interpretive, then we can\nreformulate some of the questions raised above concerning how much\nemphasis is to be placed upon coherence in adjudication in terms of the\nextent to which, in interpreting the law, we should interpret it in\nsuch a way as to realise the value of coherence in judicial decisions.\nSo, for example, is coherence the sole desideratum which should guide\njudges in interpreting the law, or is it merely one feature of a\nsuccessful such interpretation, and, moreover, is it a necessary\nfeature, or one which, although desirable, may be overridden by\ncompeting values which judges should also try to realise in\ninterpreting the law?\n\n\nLevenbook 1984 contends that it is a necessary condition for a\njudicial decision to be legally justified that it coheres with some\npart of the established law. She contrasts her understanding of this\nrequirement with that adopted by MacCormick 1978. According to\nLevenbook, while MacCormick also holds that minimal coherence with some\npart of the established law is a necessary condition of a judicial\ndecision being justified, he nevertheless contends that, so long as\nthis minimal standard is met, further considerations of coherence which\nare also relevant to the decision can be defeated on consequentialist\ngrounds. Levenbook's view is that this approach gives coherence too\nmodest a role to play in legal reasoning; once a very minimal\nrequirement of coherence is met, this value is too easily defeasible by\nother considerations. Levenbook finds this account of adjudication\ntroubling because, in her view, it fails to do justice to judges'\nresponsibility to be faithful to pre-existing law, a responsibility\nwhich places the judiciary in a quite different situation from the\nlegislature when it comes to the question of how law ought to be\ndeveloped. She contends that a judge who, within the limits allowed to\nhim by the law, adopts a decision which is better on moral grounds over\none which displays greater congruence with the trend or spirit of the\nexisting law has made a mistake, and has adopted a legally unjustified\ndecision. Levenbook very succinctly focuses the dilemma which judges\nmust confront in deciding how much weight is to be placed on\nconsiderations of coherence in judicial decisions: should judges always\nadopt the outcome to a case which best coheres with the pre-existing\nlaw, or can they ever be justified in adopting an outcome which is less\ncoherent but morally preferable? This way of focusing the dilemma which\njudges may face brings out another important aspect of coherence in\nlegal reasoning, namely that granting a strong role to considerations\nof coherence is to place considerable emphasis on the backward-looking\naspect of adjudication, as such an approach may require judges to place\ngreater value on adhering to what has gone before, rather than on doing\nwhat would otherwise, on moral grounds, be the right thing.\n\n\nRaz (1994a), who contends that coherence in legal reasoning is\nsometimes desirable, but certainly defeasible, poses essentially the\nsame dilemma, but seems to place the burden of proof on those grasping\nthe other horn of it. That is to say, Raz asks not how could it ever be\njustified for judges to deviate from the trend of the existing law in\norder to adopt a less coherent but otherwise morally preferable\ndecision, but rather why should judges ever deviate from what is\notherwise the morally best solution to a case before them on grounds of\ncoherence? The burden of proof point is important because Raz's view\nseems to be that arguments in favour of a strong role for coherence in\nlegal reasoning go through too easily, or are too readily adopted as a\ndefault position, perhaps because of the fact that reasoning by analogy\nis a common feature of many legal systems and seems to lend itself to\nbeing characterised in coherence terms, such that the facts speak for\nthemselves in favour of the conclusion that considerations of coherence\nhave a special role to play in legal reasoning. Pointing out that\nreasoning by analogy is not a necessary fact of life in all legal\nsystems, and that, even where it does feature, it is still necessary to\nprovide an explanation of the rationale of arguments from analogy, and\nthe links between such arguments and coherence accounts of\nadjudication, Raz seeks to shift the burden of proof onto those who\nchampion coherence. If judges are sometimes to deviate from what would\notherwise be, according to law, the morally best outcome to a case\nbefore them on grounds of coherence, then, Raz contends, we are in need\nof a convincing positive argument why this should be so.\n",
