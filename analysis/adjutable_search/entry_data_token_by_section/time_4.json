    "main_text": "The A-Theory and the B-Theory\n5. The A-Theory and the B-Theory\n\nIn\n Section 1,\n we introduced the distinction between a tensed proposition and a\ntenseless proposition. Tensed propositions can fully and accurately\ndescribe the world, but nevertheless change truth value over time.\nTenseless propositions, on the other hand, are always true or always\nfalse\u2014they reference a particular time in the proposition and\nnever change. Propositions represent ways reality could be. So, which\nview of propositions we adopt depends on what we think it means for\nreality itself to undergo change.\n\nIn\n section 4,\n we discussed McTaggart\u2019s distinction between time conceived of\nas a B-series (events ordered by which come before and which come\nafter) and time conceived of as an A-series (events ordered by which\nare present, which are past, and which are future). Though not\nparticularly creative as names, the A/B distinction has stuck around\nas a way of classifying theories of change.\n\nB-theorists think all change can be described in before-after terms.\nThey typically portray spacetime as a spread-out manifold with events\noccurring at different locations in the manifold (often assuming a\nsubstantivalist picture). Living in a world of change means living in\na world with variation in this manifold. To say that a certain autumn\nleaf changed color is just to say that the leaf is green in an earlier\nlocation of the manifold and red in a later location. The locations,\nin these cases, are specific times in the manifold. And all of the\nmetaphysically important facts about change can be captured by\ntenseless propositions like \u201cThe leaf is red at October 7,\n2019\u201d. \u201cThe leaf is not red at September 7,\n2019\u201d.\n\nA-theorists, on the other hand, believe that at least some important\nforms of change require classifying events as past, present or future.\nAnd accurately describing this kind of change requires some tensed\npropositions\u2014there is a way reality is (now, presently) which is\ncomplete but was different in the past and also will\nbe different in the future. These tensed propositions also\nexplain why we tend to attribute significance to the\npast-present-future distinction. For example, you might think the\nA-theorist is in a better position to explain why we care whether a\nhorrible event is already in the past versus still in the future. Some\nA-theorists will argue that we aren\u2019t concerned with\nlocation\u2014we care that the event is over with in reality.\n\nNote, also, there is a significant range of views within the A-theory\ncamp about whether there is a spacetime manifold (Moving Spotlighters\nthink there is), or whether only present events are real (the\npresentist view), or whether only present and past events are real\n(the Growing Block view). We say more about all of these views below.\nA-theorists also debate whether objects themselves undergo A-theoretic\nchange or whether it is only entire regions of spacetime that change\nthis way.\n\nA-theorists and B-theorists appeal to different sources of evidence\nfor their different views of passage. A-theorists typically emphasize\nhow psychologically we seem to perceive a world of robust passage or\n\u201cflow\u201d of time. In physics, the laws of thermodynamics\nseem to imply a strong past-to-future direction to time. And quantum\nmechanics seems to identify an important sense of simultaneity, which\ncould be identified with presentness (see\n section 11\n below). Finally many commonsense ways of thinking of change seem to\nrely on A-theory descriptions of passage. For instance, they will use\nthe fact that we care so much about whether bad events are past as\nevidence that there are ineliminable tensed propositions and those\npropositions represent ineliminable A-properties.\n\nB-theorists typically emphasize how special relativity eliminates the\npast/present/future distinction from physical models of space and\ntime. Thus what seems like an awkward way to express facts about time\nin ordinary English is actually much closer to the way we express\nfacts about time in physics. Moreover, thinking of change in tenseless\nterms makes it easier to describe in a logically consistent way how\nobjects survive change\u2014objects have properties only relative to\nparticular times, so there is no worry about attributing absolutely\ninconsistent properties to anything. We\u2019ll consider some of\nthese arguments in more detail in the remaining sections of this\nentry, as we consider more specific variations on A-theories and\nB-theories of time.\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: For general\ndiscussion of The A theory and The B theory: Emery 2017;\nLe Poidevin 1998; Le Poidevin and McBeath 1993; Markosian 1993;\nMaudlin 2007 (especially Chapter 4); Mellor 1998; Paul 2010; Prior\n1959 [1976], 1962 [1968], 1967, 1968, 1970, 1996; Sider 2001; Skow\n2009; Smart 1963, 1949; Smith 1993; Sullivan 2012a; Williams 1951;\nZimmerman 2005; Zwart 1976.\n",
