    "main_text": "Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance || Boethius/Nicomachus, Calcidius, Macrobius and the Middle Ages\n5.2 The Renaissance: Ficino, Pico, Reuchlin, Copernicus and Kepler\n\nIn the Renaissance, Pythagoreanism played an important role in the\nthought of fifteenth- and sixteenth century Italian and German\nhumanists. The Florentine Marsilio Ficino (1433\u20131499) is most\nproperly described as a Neoplatonist. He made the philosophy of Plato\navailable to the Latin-speaking west through his translation of all of\nPlato into Latin. In addition he translated important works of writers\nin the Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean tradition, such as Plotinus,\nPorphyry, Iamblichus and Proclus. From that tradition he accepted and\ndeveloped the view that Plato was heir to an ancient\ntheology/philosophy (prisca theologia) that was derived from\nearlier sages including Pythagoras, who immediately preceded Plato in\nthe succession (Allen 2014, 435\u2013436). Ficino like the\nNeopythagoreans had no conception of an early and a late\nPythagoreanism, for him Pythagoreanism was a unity as indeed was the\nentire tradition of ancient theology (Celenza, 1999, 675\u2013681).\nFicino regarded works ascribed to the Chaldaean Zoroaster, the\nEgyptian Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus and Pythagoras, which modern\nscholarship has shown to be forgeries of late antiquity, as genuine\nworks on which Plato drew (Kristeller 1979, 131). Ficino provided a\ncomplete translation of the writings ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus\ninto Latin as well as translations of 39 of the short Pythagorean\nsayings known as symbola, many of which are ancient, and\nHierocles\u2019 commentary on the pseudo-Pythagorean Golden\nVerses (Heninger 1974, 63 and 66). The Golden Verses\n(see Thom 1995) were, in fact, one of the most popular Greek texts in\nthe Renaissance and were commonly used in textbooks for learning\nGreek; other pseudo-Pythagorean texts, such as the treatises ascribed\nto Timaeus of Locri and Ocellus, were translated early and regarded as\ngenuine texts on which Plato drew (Heninger 1974, 49, 55\u201356).\nFicino thought, moreover, that this whole pagan tradition could be\nreconciled with Christian and Jewish religion and accepted the view\nthat Pythagoras was born of a Jewish father (Heninger 1974, 201). For\nFicino and the Renaissance as a whole, Pythagoras was the most\nimportant of the Presocratic philosophers but he never overshadowed\nPlato, who was the highest authority, in part because there was no\nextensive body of texts by Pythagoras himself to compete with the\nPlatonic dialogues (Allen 2014, 453).\n\nFicino translated Iamblichus\u2019 four works on Pythagoreanism for\nhis own use and Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life had\nparticular influence on him. Ficino felt that in his time there was a\nneed for a divinely inspired guide on earth and fashioned himself as\nsuch a prophet under the influence of Iamblichus\u2019 presentation\nof Pythagoras as a divine guide sent by the gods to save mankind\n(Celenza 1999, 667\u2013674). The Pythagorean musical practice that\nhe found in Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life , with\nits emphasis on the impact of music on the soul, shaped his own music\nmaking and his presentation of himself as a Pythagorean and Orphic\nholy man (Allen 2014, 436\u2013440). Ficino and other Renaissance\nthinkers grappled with the challenge that the Pythagorean notion of\nmetempsychosis presented to Christiantiy and how it might be\nreconciled with Christian views (Allen 2014, 440\u2013446). Ficino\nwas eager to absolve Plato from such a heresy. He does this in part by\ntreating metempsychosis metaphorically as referring to the\nsoul\u2019s ability to remake itself, but he also emphasized that\nmetempsychosis was not present in Plato\u2019s latest work,\nLaws, and made the Pythagoreans scapegoats by suggesting that\nother passages in Plato refer not to Plato\u2019s own doctrines but\nthe Pythagoreans (Celenza 1999, 681\u2013691). Ficino saw his own\narithmology as Pythgorean and study of Neopythagorean mathematical\ntreatises by Nicomachus and Theon led Ficino to conclude that\nPlato\u2019s nuptial number in Book 8 of the Republic was 12\n(Allen 2014, 446\u2013450). He also mistakenly and paradoxically\nfollowed the Neopythagoreans in thinking that the Pythagoreans\noccupied the crucial position in the history of philosophy of the\nfirst philosophers to distinguish between the corporeal and\nincorporeal and to assert the superiority of the latter, an\nachievement that is more reasonably assigned to Ficino\u2019s hero\nPlato (Celenza 1999, 699\u2013706). \n\nThe Pythagorean symbola were important to Ficino and the\nRenaissance. They had already been interpreted as moral maxims by the\nearly church fathers (e.g., Clement, Origen and Ambrose). Ambrose, for\nexample, interpreted the Pythagorean \u201cdo not take the public\npath\u201d to mean that priests should live lives of exceptional\npurity (Ep. 81). Jerome discussed 13 symbola in his\nEpistle Against Rufinus and this list became the basis for\nmedieval discussions of the symbola in texts such as the\nSpeculum historiale of Vincent of Beauvais and the Lives\nand Habits of the Philosophers  of Walter Burley (Celenza 2001,\n11\u201312). Ficino particularly encountered them in\nIamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life and\nProtrepticus. For Ficino, their brevity was appropriate to\nrevealing the supreme reality, since he argued that the closer the\nmind approaches to the One the fewer words it needs (Allen 2014,\n450\u2013451). In addition, he found them relevant to the preparation\nand purification of the soul (Celenza, 1999, 693). They were widely\ndiscussed by Ficino\u2019s contemporaries and successors (Celenza\n2001, 52\u201381). Some figures wrote treatises devoted to their\ninterpretation (Ficino\u2019s mentor Antonio degli Agli, his follower\nGiovanni Nesi [for an edition of Nesi\u2019s work see Celenza 2001],\nFilippo Beroaldo the Elder and Lilio Gregorio Giraldi), while others\ndiscussed them as part of larger works (Erasmus and Reuchlin). Not\neveryone took the symbola seriously; Angelo Poliziano, the\ngreat Florentine philologist and professor, presents a satire on them\nin the fashion of Lucian, joking about Pythagoras\u2019 ability to\ntalk to animals and ridiculing the prohibition on beans (Celenza 2001,\n33).\n\nFicino\u2019s friend and younger contemporary, Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola (1463\u20131494), advanced an even more radical doctrine of\nuniversal truth, according to which all philosophies had a share of\ntruth and could be reconciled in a comprehensive philosophy\n(Kristeller 1979, 205). His Oration on the Dignity of Man\nshows the variety of ways in which he was influenced by the\nPythagorean tradition. He equates the friendship that the Pythagoreans\nsaw as the goal of philosophy (see, e.g., Iamblichus, VP 229)\nwith the peace that the angels announced to men of good will (1965,\n11\u201312); the Pythagorean symbola forbidding urinating\ntowards the sun or cutting the nails during sacrifice are interpreted\nallegorically as calling on us to relieve ourselves of excessive\nappetite for sensual pleasures and to trim the pricks of anger (1965,\n15); the practice of philosophizing through numbers is assigned to\nPythagoras along with Philolaus, Plato and the early Platonists (1965,\n25\u201326); Pythagoras is said to have modeled his philosophy on the\nOrphic theology (1965, 33). Finally, on the basis of the\npseudo-Pythagorean letter of Lysis to Hipparchus, Pythagoras is said\nto have kept silent about his doctrine and left just a few things in\nwriting to his daughter at his death. In observing such silence,\nPythagoras is portrayed as following an earlier practice symbolized by\nthe sphinx in Egypt and most of all by Moses, who indeed published the\nlaw to men but supposedly kept the interpretation of that law a\nsecret. Pico equates this secret interpretation of the law with the\nCabala, an esoteric doctrine in which the words and numbers of Hebrew\nscripture are interpreted according to a mystical system (1965, 30;\nsee also Heptaplus 1965, 68).\n\nPico\u2019s interest in reconciling the Cabala with Christianity and\nthe pagan philosophical tradition, including Pythagoreanism, was\nfurther developed by the German humanist, Johannes Reuchlin\n(1445\u20131522). In the dedicatory letter for his Three\nBooks On the Art of the Cabala (1517), which was\naddressed to Pope Leo X, Reuchlin says that as Ficino has restored\nPlato for Italy so he will \u201coffer to the Germans Pythagoras\nreborn,\u201d although he cannot \u201cdo this without the cabala of\nthe Hebrews, because the philosophy of Pythagoras took its beginning\nfrom the precepts of the cabalists\u201d (tr. Heninger 1974, 245).\nThus, in an earlier work (De verbo mirifico) he had equated\nthe four consonants in the Hebrew name for God, JHVH, with the\nPythagorean tetraktys, and gave to each of the letters, which\nare equated with numbers as in Greek practice, a mystical meaning. The\nfirst H, which also stands for the number five that the Pythagoreans\nequated with marriage, is thus taken to symbolize the marriage of the\ntrinity with material nature, which was equated with the dyad by the\nNeopythagoreans (Riedweg 2005, 130).\n\nAt the level of popular culture, several fortune-telling devices were\ntied to Pythagoras, the most famous of which went under the name of\nthe Wheel of Pythagoras (Heninger 1974, 237). Pythagoras was probably\nmost widely known, however, through Ovid\u2019s presentation of him\nat the beginning of Book XV of the Metamorphoses, which was\nimmensely popular in the Renaissance (Heninger 1974, 50). Ovid\nrecounts the story, which had already been recognized as apocryphal by\nCicero (Tusc. IV 1), that the second Roman king, Numa,\nstudied with Pythagoras. Pythagoras is presented inaccurately by Ovid\nas a great natural philosopher, who discovered the secrets of the\nuniverse and who believed in a doctrine of the flux of four elements.\nOn the other hand, Ovid\u2019s emphasis on the prohibition on eating\nanimal flesh and on the immortality of the soul have some connection\nto the historical Pythagoras. In the Renaissance, Pythagoras was not\nprimarily known for the \u201cPythagorean Theorem,\u201d as he is\ntoday. Better known was the doubtful anecdote (Burkert 1960, Riedweg\n2005, 90\u201397), going back ultimately to Heraclides of Pontus but\nknown to the Renaissance mainly through Cicero (Tusc. V\n3\u20134), that he was the first to coin the word\n\u201cphilosopher\u201d (Heninger 1974, 29).\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Pythagorean influence was particularly\nimportant in the development of astronomy. The Polish astronomer\nCopernicus (1473\u20131543), in the Preface and Dedication to\nPope Paul III attached to his epoch making work, On the\nRevolution of the Heavenly Spheres, reports that, in his\ndissatisfaction with the commonly accepted geocentric astronomical\nsystem of Ptolemy (2nd century CE), he laboriously reread the works of\nall the philosophers to see if any had ever proposed a different\nsystem. This labor led him to find inspiration not from Pythagoras\nhimself but rather from later Pythagoreans and in particular from\nPhilolaus. Copernicus found in Cicero (Ac. II 39. 123) that\nthe Pythagorean Hicetas (4th century BCE \u2014 Copernicus mistakenly\ncalls him Nicetas) had proposed that the earth revolved around its\naxis at the center of the universe and in pseudo-Plutarch (Diels 1958,\n378) that another Pythagorean, Ecphantus, and Heraclides of Pontus\n(both 4th century BCE), whom Copernicus regarded as a Pythagorean, had\nproposed a similar view. More importantly, he also found in\npseudo-Plutarch that the Pythagorean, Philolaus of Croton (5th century\nBCE), \u201cheld that the earth moved in a circle \u2026 and was\none of the planets\u201d (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly\nSpheres 1. 5, tr. Wallis).\n\nCopernicus reports to the Pope that he was led by these earlier\nthinkers \u201cto meditate on the mobility of the earth.\u201d\nPythagorean influence on Copernicus was not limited to the notion of a\nmoving earth. In the same preface he explains his hesitation to\npublish his book in light of the pseudo-Pythagorean letter of Lysis to\nHipparchus, which recounts the supposed reluctance of the Pythagoreans\nto divulge their views to the common run of people, who had not\ndevoted themselves to study (for further Pythagorean influences on\nCopernicus see Kahn 2001, 159\u2013161). A number of the followers of\nCopernicus saw him as primarily reviving the ancient Pythagorean\nsystem rather than presenting anything new (Heninger 1974, 130 and\n144, n. 131); Edward Sherburne reflects the common view of the late\n17th century in referring to the heliocentric system as \u201cthe\nsystem of Philolaus and Copernicus\u201d (Heninger 1974,\n129\u2013130), although in the Philolaic system it is, in fact, a\ncentral fire and not the sun that is at the center of the\nuniverse.\n\nThe last great Pythagorean was Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630\n\u2014 see Kahn 2001, 161\u2013172 for a good brief account of\nKepler\u2019s Pythagoreanism). Kepler began by developing the\nCopernican system in light of the five regular solids (tetrahedron,\ncube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron), to which Plato\nappealed in his construction of matter in the Timaeus (see\nespecially 53B-55C). He followed the Renaissance practice illustrated\nabove of regarding Greek philosophy as closely connected to the wisdom\nof the Near East, when he asserted that the Timaeus was a\ncommentary on the first chapter of Genesis (Kahn 2001, 162).\nIn the preface to his early work, Mysterium Cosmographicum\n(1596), Kepler says that his purpose is to show that God used the five\nregular bodies, \u201cwhich have been most celebrated from the time\nof Pythagoras and Plato,\u201d as his model in constructing the\nuniverse and that \u201che accommodated the number of heavenly\nspheres, their proportions, and the system of their motions\u201d to\nthese five regular solids (tr. Heninger 1974, 110\u2013111).\n\nIn ascribing geometrical knowledge of the five regular solids to\nPythagoras, Kepler is following an erroneous Neopythagorean tradition,\nalthough the dodecahedron may have served as an early Pythagorean\nsymbol (see on Hippasus in section 3.4 above and Burkert 1972,\n70\u201371, 404, 460). Thus, this aspect of Kepler\u2019s work is\nmore Platonic than Pythagorean. The five solids were conceived of as\ncircumscribing and inscribed in the spheres of the orbits of the\nplanets, so that the five solids corresponded to the six planets known\nto Kepler (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury). There were\nsix planets, because there were precisely five regular bodies to be\nused in constructing the universe, corresponding to the five intervals\nbetween the planets. This view was overthrown by the later discovery\nof Uranus as a seventh planet. Kepler\u2019s cosmology was, however,\nfar from a purely a priori exercise. Whereas his\ncontemporary, Robert Fludd, developed a cosmology structured by\nmusical numbers, which could in no way be confirmed by observation,\nKepler strove to make his system consistent with precise observations.\nKahn suggests that we here see again the split \u201cbetween a\nrational and an obscurantist version of Pythagorean thought,\u201d\nwhich is similar to the ancient split in the school between\nmathematici and acusmatici (2001, 163).\n\nClose work with observational data collected by Tycho Brahe led Kepler\nto abandon the universal ancient view that the orbits of the planets\nwere circular and to recognize their elliptical nature. More clearly\nPythagorean is Kepler\u2019s consistent belief that the data show\nthat the motions of the planets correspond in various ways to the\nratios governing the musical concords (see Dreyer 1953,\n405\u2013410), so that there is a heavenly music, a doctrine attested\nfor Philolaus and Archytas, which probably goes back to Pythagoras as\nwell. For Kepler, however, the music produced by the heavenly motions\nwas \u201cperceived by reason, and not expressed in sound\u201d\n(Harmonice Mundi V 7). In his attempt to make the numbers of\nthe heavenly music work, he joked that he would appeal to the shade of\nPythagoras for aid, \u201cunless the soul of Pythagoras has migrated\ninto mine\u201d (Koestler 1959, 277).\n\nKepler has been described \u201cas the last exponent of a form of\nmathematical cosmology that can be traced back to the shadowy figure\nof Pythagoras\u201d (Field 1988, 170). It is true that Kepler\u2019s\nwork led the way to Newton\u2019s mechanics, which cannot be\ndescribed in terms of ancient geometry and number theory but relies on\nthe calculus and which relies on a theory of physical forces that is\nalien to ancient thought. On the other hand, many modern scientists\naccept the basic tenet that knowledge of the natural world is to be\nexpressed in mathematical formulae, which is rightly regarded as a\ncentral Pythagorean thesis, since it was first rigorously formulated\nby the Pythagoreans Philolaus ( Fr. 4) and Archytas and may, in a\nrudimentary form, go back to Pythagoras himself.\n",
