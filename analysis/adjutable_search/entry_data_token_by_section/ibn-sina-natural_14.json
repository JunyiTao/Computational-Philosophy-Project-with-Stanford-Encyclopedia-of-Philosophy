    "main_text": "Conditions for Motion || Place and Void\n4.2 Time and the Age of the Universe\n\nAmong the conditions associated with motion, time (Gk.\nchronos, Ar. zam\u0101n) is at least as important as\nthat of place and void, for it is a necessary concomitant of motion.\n(A number of studies on various aspects of Avicenna\u2019s temporal\ntheory exist and include Shayegan 1986; McGinnis 1999; Mayer 2007; and\nLammer 2018, ch. 6.) In order to appreciate time\u2019s relation to\nmotion, there is a more basic question that must be answered first:\nDoes time exist? An affirmative answer will seem obvious to many, but\nAristotle at Physics, 4.10 had offered a series of\nobjections, four in all, that cast doubt on the reality of time.\nMoreover, in his own positive account of what time is, Aristotle does\nnot address all of the objections or even provide a general proof that\ntime must exist in light of the objections. One may then criticize\nAristotle\u2019s account of time in light of his own theory of\nscience: Aristotle has proceeded to a theory of what time is\nbefore providing us with a proof that time\n is.[11]\n\nAfter presenting the objections to and opinions about time, Avicenna\nbegins his own account of time (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.10\u201313) by\nfilling this lacuna in Aristotle\u2019s presentation.\nAvicenna\u2019s general strategy is to take as empirically obvious\ncertain facts about motion and then show that these facts cannot be\nexplained unless there is associated with motion a certain magnitude,\nwhich we commonly identify with time. Only having shown that time\nexists does Avicenna then provide a scientifically adequate\nexplanation of what time essentially is.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s\n proof that time exists assumes these initial facts about moving\nbodies:\n\nIf two moving bodies, which have the same speed, start and stop on\nthe same mark (say a blast of a horn), then they traverse the same\ndistance;\nIf two moving bodies, which again have the same speed, both stop\non the same mark, but start on two different marks, the body that\nstarted on the second mark traverses less distance than the body that\nstarted on the first mark;\nIf two moving bodies, which now have different speeds, start and\nstop on the same mark, then the slower moving body traverses less\ndistance than the faster moving body.\n\n\nOn the basis of these facts, Avicenna observes that associated with\nmoving bodies there is a certain possibility or capacity\n(imk\u0101n) to traverse some spatial magnitude. Moreover,\nthis capacity corresponds with the starting and stopping of the motion\n(that is, a kinematic magnitude). When the body is moving slower, a\ngreater amount of this possibility is required to cover the same\nspatial magnitude as that of a faster moving body. Given this\npossibility\u2019s relation and correspondence with both spatial and\nkinematic magnitudes, Avicenna concludes that this capacity must be\nsome magnitude that stands in some relation to the distance and speed.\nThis magnitude is neither the magnitude of the body, whether the\nbody\u2019s bulk or weight, nor the magnitude of the motion, whether\nthe speed or motivity, nor the magnitude of the distance traversed.\nInstead, this magnitude\u2014again, the possibility belonging to a\nmoving body to cover more or less distance at a fixed\nspeed\u2014concludes Avicenna, is what we call time\n(zam\u0101n).\n\nWhile identifying time with a certain possibility to traverse some\nspatial magnitude, provides one with a criterion for recognizing time,\nit does not provide a proper scientific definition of what time\nessentially is, that is, a definition in terms of genus and\ndifference. Thus, having shown that time exists, Avicenna next turns\nto defining time and showing what time essentially is. In general,\nAvicenna follows Aristotle and defines time as a \u201cnumber of\nmotion when it is differentiated into prior and posterior parts\u201d\n(cf. Aristotle, Physics 4.1, 219b1\u20132). Time\u2019s\ngenus, then, is a certain number, that is, some measurable aspect or\nmagnitude, belonging to motion. Its difference is having essentially\nprior and posterior elements. Here is it important to note that for\nAvicenna, priority and posterity (taqaddum and\nta\u02beakhkhur) are generic notions, with a number of\ndifferent species, like priority in eminence or location or time. For\nAvicenna, the prior and posterior in Aristotle\u2019s definition\nrefers to what is prior and posterior in the distance traversed as\ndetermined by the directedness of the motion over that distance. Thus,\nthe charges of some, particularly Galen, that Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition of time is circular, since it appeals to purportedly\ntemporal notions of before and after, is avoided. (See Lammer 2018,\nch. 6.2).\n\nIn all three of Avicenna\u2019s philosophical\nencyclopedias\u2014The Cure, The Salvation and Pointers\nand Reminders\u2014he notes that, more precisely, time is a\nmagnitude of circular motion with respect to the prior and\nposterior. His insistence on circular motion rather than just motion\nin general is that only circular motion can potentially have neither\nbeginning nor end. In other words, only circular motion can be\ninfinitely extended into the past and future.\n\nWhile Avicenna has any number of arguments for the eternity of time\nand the world, his proof for the existence of time in terms of a\npossibility to traverse greater or lesser spatial magnitudes at a\nfixed velocity provides the basis for one of his central physical\narguments for that thesis. The argument, which is a reductio ad\nabsurdum has one assume that God created time, and so motion and\nmoving bodies, at some first moment, x, in the finite past,\nfor example, 10,000 years ago. Prior to x nothing but God\nexisted, not even time. (Here let years be measured in solar rotations\nas measured by the apparent motion of our sun. Also allow that the\npresent moment marks the completion of the 10,000 solar rotations, so\nthat right now is the second terminal point for this motion.) Avicenna\nnext observes that it is certainly possible that God could have made a\ntime, and so motion and moving bodies, 20,000 solar rotations in\nduration, where this possible duration again reaches to the present\nmoment as its second terminal point. In this second scenario, 10,000\nyears of the full 20,000 year duration would exactly correspond with\nthe 10,000 years in the first scenario, namely, the period extending\nfrom the present moment back to x. The remaining duration of\nthis possible 20,000-year motion would correspond with the possibility\nfor 10,000 solar rotations, which now would terminate at x\nrather than beginning at x. (We can intuitively say that this\nremaining possibility is prior to or earlier than x, although\nAvicenna is careful not to beg any questions.) Now to say that there\nis a possibility for 10,000 solar rotations (prior to x) is\njust to say that (prior to x) there exist a possibility for a\nsun (or other body) to traverse a certain distance (that is, number of\nrotations) at a fixed speed. From Avicenna\u2019s earlier proof for\nthe existence of time, however, recall that the possibility for a\nmoving body to traverse a given distance at a fixed speed refers to\ntime. Consequently, since this possibility exists, time must exist.\nYet in order for time to exist, as Avicenna argued, motion and moving\nbodies must exist. Therefore, concludes Avicenna, when nothing but God\nexisted, time, motion and a moving body also would have necessarily\nexisted, a blatant contradiction. It is the assumption that time is\nfinite, claims Avicenna, that gives rise to the contradiction. Since\nthis same argument applies to any finite duration of time, during\nwhich one may suppose the world to exist, Avicenna concludes that\ntime, and so motion and moving bodies, must have existed infinitely\ninto the past. (For the same reason mutatis mutandis time,\nand so motion and moving bodies, also must exist infinitely into the\nfuture.)\n\nWhile I have only scratched the surface of the riches of\nAvicenna\u2019s natural philosophy, the above discussions provide a\nnumber of the most basic points of his thought.\n",
