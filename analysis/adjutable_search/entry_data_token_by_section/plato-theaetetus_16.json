The point of Socrates\u2019 argument is that this\naddition does not help us to obtain an adequate account of false\nbelief because thought (dianoia) has to be understood as an\ninner process, with objects that we are always fully and explicitly\nconscious of. If we are fully and explicitly conscious of all the\nobjects of our thoughts, and if the objects of our thoughts are as\nsimple as empiricism takes them to be, there is simply no room for\ninadvertency. But without inadvertency, the third proposal simply\ncollapses back into the first proposal, which has already been\nrefuted.\n\n\nThe empiricist conception of knowledge that Theaetetus unwittingly\nbrings forth, and which Socrates is scrutinising, takes the objects of\nthought to be simple mental images which are either straightforwardly\navailable to be thought about, or straightforwardly absent. The First\nPuzzle showed that there is a general problem for the empiricist about\nexplaining how such images can be confused with each other, or indeed\nsemantically conjoined in any way at all. The Second Puzzle showed\nthat, because the empiricist lacks clear alternatives other than that\nsomeone should have a mental image or lack it, he is\nwide open to the sophistical argument which identifies\nbelieving with having a mental image, and then\nidentifies believing what is with having a mental\nimage, too\u2014and so \u201cproves\u201d the impossibility of\nfalse belief. The Third Puzzle restricts itself (at least up to 190d7)\nto someone who has the requisite mental images, and adds the\nsuggestion that he manages to confuse them by a piece of inadvertency.\nSocrates\u2019 rejoinder is that nothing has been done to show how\nthere can be inadvertent confusions of things that are as simple and\nunstructured, and as simply grasped or not grasped, as the\nempiricist takes mental images to be. Just as speech is explicit\nouter dialogue, so thought is explicit inner\ndialogue. What the empiricist needs to do to show the possibility of\nsuch a confusion is to explain how, on his principles, either speech\nor thought can fail to be fully explicit and fully \u201cin\ntouch\u201d with its objects, if it is \u201cin touch\u201d with\nthem at all.\n\n\nIn the discussion of the Fourth and Fifth Puzzles, Socrates and\nTheaetetus together work out the detail of two empiricist attempts to\nexplain just this. It then becomes clearer why Plato does not think\nthat the empiricist can explain the difference between fully explicit\nand not-fully-explicit speech or thought. Plato thinks that, to\nexplain this, we have to abandon altogether the empiricist conception\nof thought as the concatenation (somehow) of semantically inert simple\nmental images. Instead, we have to understand thought as the syntactic\nconcatenation of the genuine semantic entities, the Forms.\nMistakes in thought will then be comprehensible as mistakes either\nabout the logical interrelations of the Forms, or about the correct\napplication of the Forms to the sensory phenomena.\n",
