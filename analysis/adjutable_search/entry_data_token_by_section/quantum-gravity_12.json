    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || Status of quantum theory\n5.3 Status of quantum theory\n\nWhether or not spacetime is discrete, the quantization of spacetime\nentails that our ordinary notion of the physical world, that of matter\ndistributed in space and time, is at best an approximation. This in\nturn implies that ordinary quantum theory, in which one calculates\nprobabilities for events to occur in a given world, is inadequate as a\nfundamental theory. As suggested in the\n Introduction,\n this may present us with a vicious circle. At the very least, one\nmust almost certainly generalize the framework of quantum theory. This\nis an important driving force behind much of the effort in quantum\ncosmology to provide a well-defined version of the\n many-worlds\n or\n relative-state\n interpretations. Much work in this area has adopted the so-called\n\u2018decoherent histories\u2019 or \u2018consistent\nhistories\u2019 formalism, whereby quantum theories are understood to\nmake probabilistic predictions about entire (coarse-grained)\n\u2018histories\u2019. Almost all of this work to date construes\nhistories to be histories of spatiotemporal events, and thus\npresupposes a background spacetime; however, the incorporation of a\ndynamical, quantized spacetime clearly drives much of the\ncosmology-inspired work in this area.\n\nMore generally, one might step outside the framework of canonical,\nloop quantum gravity, and ask why one should only quantize the metric.\nAs pointed out by Isham (1994, 2002), it may well be that the\nextension of quantum theory to general relativity requires one to\nquantize, in some sense, not only the metric but also the underlying\ndifferential structure and topology. This is somewhat unnatural from\nthe standpoint where one begins with classical, canonical general\nrelativity and proceeds to \u201cquantize\u201d (since the\ntopological structure, unlike the metric structure, is not represented\nby a classical variable). But one might well think that one should\nstart with the more fundamental, quantum theory, and then investigate\nunder which circumstances one gets something that looks like a\nclassical spacetime.\n\nOne final issue we might mention here is whether there is a conflict\nbetween the superposition principle and general relativity. Curiel\nclaims that \u201c[t]here exists no physical phenomenon well\ncharacterized by experiment that cannot be accurately described by one\nof the two theories, and no physical phenomenon that suggests that one\nof the two is correct to the detriment of the other\u2019s\naccuracy\u201d (2001, p. S432). However, Roger Penrose (2004, Chapter\n30) has forcefully argued that the superposition principle can, in\nsome circumstances, threaten the principle of general covariance,\nsurely a core principle of general relativity! The idea is that if we\nprepare a lump of matter in a superposition of two position states\n(stationary in their ambient spacetime), \u03c7 and \u03c6, a state\nPenrose labels a \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Lump\u201d state,\nthen the superposition is represented by: |\u03a8\u27e9 =\nw|\u03c7\u27e9 + z|\u03c6\u27e9. Penrose then shows that a\nstationary gravitational field does nothing to affect the fact that\nany superposition of the (stationary) position states \u03c7 and \u03c6\nwill also be stationary. But then introducing the gravitational field\nof the lump itself raises a problem. By themselves, the components of\nthe superposition would not seem to raise problems, and we can simply\nthink of the field around the location associated with the\nlump\u2019s states individually as being nearly classical. Given the\nstationarity of the states \u03c7 and \u03c6, there will be a distinct\nKilling vector (i.e. a metric preserving vector field) associated with\neach them. The problem then arises: what of superpositions of these\nlump states? Are they stationary? Since the Killing vector fields of\nthe two component stationary states live on different spacetimes, with\ndifferent structures, it seems we don\u2019t have the invariant\nspatiotemporal structure needed to answer the question. To try and say\nthat the spacetime is really the same (the obvious answer) would\nconflict with general covariance since then one would be supposing a\nrobust notion of spacetime points which enables one to match up the\ntwo spacetimes. As we have seen above, Penrose\u2019s proposed\nsolution is to consider such superpositions as generating a kind of\ngeometric instability which causes the collapse of the\nsuperposition.\n\nOf course, one might question various moves in Penrose\u2019s\nreasoning here (especially as regards the nature of the gravitational\nfields of stationary quantum states), so there is clearly more to be\nsaid. But there is potentially a conflict (and a measurable one at\nthat: see Penrose, 2002) between the superposition principle and\nprinciples of general relativity. Those with experience of the\nstandard quantum measurement problem will find much to interest them\nin this problem.\n",
