    "main_text": "Beyond Egoism vs. Altruism\n6. Beyond Egoism vs. Altruism\n\nIn the colorful passage quoted at the beginning of\n section 5.4,\n Batson seems to suggest that in the debate between egoists and\naltruists there are only two possible outcomes. If all human behavior\nis ultimately motivated by self-interested desires, then the egoist\nwins; if some human behavior is motivated by ultimate desires for the\nwell-being of other people, then the altruist wins. However, as \nnoted in\n section 2,\n the dialectical landscape is more complex, for there are many desires\nthat are neither self-interested nor desires for the well-being of\nother people. If any of these are ultimate desires that lead to\nbehavior, then the egoist is mistaken. But, as Batson clearly\nrecognizes, this would not vindicate altruism; both egoism and\naltruism might be mistaken. \n\nBatson has used the term principlism for one family of\nultimate desires that would support neither egoism nor altruism.\n\n\nPrinciplism is motivation with the ultimate goal of upholding some\nmoral principle\u2014for example, a principle of fairness or justice,\nor the utilitarian principle of greatest good for the greatest number.\n(Batson 2011: 220)\n\n\nUnder some circumstances, one or another of these principles might\nrequire helping behavior, though that helping behavior would not be\naltruistic, since the ultimate desire motivating the behavior is to\nuphold the principle. On Batson\u2019s view, we really don\u2019t\nknow much about principlism. \n\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, there is no clear empirical evidence that\nupholding justice (or any other moral principle) functions as an\nultimate\n goal.[25]\n Nor is there clear empirical evidence that rules this possibility\nout. (Batson 2011: 224)\n\n\nBut if that\u2019s right, then Batson\u2019s conclusion that the\nempathy-altruism hypothesis is true and that people are sometimes\naltruistic is premature. For even if it were conceded that all the\nplausible egoistic alternatives to empathy-altruism have been\nexcluded, the job of testing empathy-altruism against principalist\nalternatives has hardly begun. Moreover, the scope of that project may\nbe much larger than Batson imagines. \n\nOne way to see this is to ask which action guiding principles are\nmoral\n principles.[26]\n There is ongoing debate about this question in both philosophy and\npsychology (Stich 2018). Though Batson does not address that debate,\nthe examples he offers (\u201cfairness or justice or the utilitarian\nprinciple\u201d) suggest that when he talks about moral principles he\nhas a rather limited set of principles in mind. But if principlism is\nlimited to a relatively small set of moral principles familiar from\nthe philosophical literature, then principlism hardly exhausts the\nnon-egoistic alternatives that defenders of psychological altruism\nmust rule out. In recent years, there has been a growing body of work\non the role of norms in human life, where norms are\nunderstood as action guiding rules that can govern just about any\nhuman activity. Researchers from a variety of disciplines have argued\nthat norms, and a robust innate psychology for acquiring, storing and\nacting on norms, have played a fundamental role in shaping human\nculture and making humans the most successful large animal on the\nplanet (Henrich 2015; Boyd 2018; Kelly & Davis 2018). Others have\nproposed accounts of norm psychology on which people have ultimate\ndesires to comply with culturally acquired norms (Sripada & Stich\n2006) and accounts of how a psychological system generating such\nultimate desires might be favored by natural selection (Sripada 2008).\nThe sorts of behavioral rules that count as norms in this literature\nmight well include the sorts of moral principles that Batson had in\nmind when he characterized principlism. But these are only a small\nsubset of the norms that these researchers have in mind. What makes\nall of this relevant to our current topic is that any\nculturally acquired norm might generate an ultimate desire to comply,\nand most of those ultimate desires are neither egoistic nor\naltruistic. Thus to make a plausible case that an episode of helping\nbehavior is altruistic, it is not enough to rule out egoistic\nexplanations and explanations that appeal to principlism. The defender\nof psychological altruism must also rule out explanations that trace\nthe helping behavior to an ultimate desire to comply with any of the\nvast collection of norms that prevail in human cultures. And\nthat\u2019s a job that defenders of altruism have not even begun.\n\n\nAnother possibility is that some helping behavior might not be\nmotivated by ultimate desires at all. G\u0119siarz and Crockett (2015)\nargue that, in addition to the goal-directed system, behavior,\nincluding helping behavior, is sometimes produced by what they call\nthe habitual and Pavlovian systems. The habitual\nsystem leads to actions that have the highest expected value based on\nprevious life experiences rather than possible consequences indicated\nby features of the current situation. As a result, helping behavior\nmay be repeated in the future and in circumstances in which motivating\nfactors like the promise of rewards are absent if the behavior has\nbeen rewarded in the past. Like the habitual system, the Pavlovian\nsystem produces behavior with the highest expected value based on the\npast. Unlike the habitual system, however, the Pavlovian system\nproduces behavior that has been successful in the evolutionary past,\nrather than in an individual\u2019s past. This means that behavioral\ndispositions that have led to reproductive success in a\nindividual\u2019s evolutionary past may have become innate or\n\u201chard-wired\u201d through natural selection. If it is indeed\nthe case that some helping behavior is produced by the habitual or\nPavlovian systems, then egoism is false. And if some helping behavior\nis egoistically motivated and the rest is produced by the habitual and\nPavlovian systems, then altruism is also false. \n",
