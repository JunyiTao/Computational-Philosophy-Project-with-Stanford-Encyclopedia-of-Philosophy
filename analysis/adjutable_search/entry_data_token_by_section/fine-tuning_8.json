    "main_text": "Fine-Tuning and Design || The Anthropic Objection\n3.2 The Anthropic Objection\n\nWe could not possibly have existed in conditions that are incompatible\nwith the existence of observers. The famous weak anthropic\nprinciple (WAP) (Carter 1974) suggests that this apparently\ntrivial point may have important consequences:\n\n\n[W]e must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in\nthe universe is necessarily privileged to the extent of being\ncompatible with our existence as observers. (Carter 1974: 293,\nemphasis due to Carter)\n\n\nOur methods of empirical observation are unavoidably biased\ntowards detecting conditions which are compatible with the existence\nof observers. For example, even if life-hostile places vastly\noutnumber life-friendly places in our universe, we should not be\nsurprised to find ourselves in one of the relatively few places that\nare life-friendly and seek an explanation for this finding, simply\nbecause\u2014in virtue of being living organisms\u2014we could not\npossibly have found ourselves in a life-hostile place. Biases that\nresult from the fact that what we observe must be compatible with the\nexistence of observers are referred to as observation selection\neffects. The observation selection effects emphasized by the weak\nanthropic principle with respect to location in the universe are\nemphasized by what Carter dubs the strong anthropic principle\n(SAP) with respect to the universe as a whole:\n\n\n[T]he Universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it\ndepends) must be such as to admit within it the creation of observers\nwithin it at some stage. (Carter 1974: 294)\n\n\nCarter\u2019s formulation of the SAP has led some authors, most\ninfluentially Barrow and Tipler (1986), to misinterpret it along\nteleological lines and as thereby categorically different from the\nWAP. But, as Carter himself highlights (1983: 352), see also Leslie\n(1989: 135\u2013145), the SAP is meant to highlight exactly the same\ntype of bias as the WAP and is literally stronger than the WAP only\nwhen conjoined with a version of the multiverse hypothesis.\n\nThe so-called anthropic objection against the argument from\nfine-tuning for design argues that that argument breaks down once our\nbiasedness due to the observation selection effects emphasized by the\nweak and strong anthropic principles is taken into account. Elliott\nSober (2003, 2009) advocates this objection. According to him, the\nargument from fine-tuning for design requires not the likelihood\ninequality \\(\\eqref{likelihoods}\\) but the much more problematic \n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nP(R\\mid D,\\textit{OSE}) > P(R\\mid \\neg D,\\textit{OSE})\\, \n\\label{ose}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \u201cOSE\u201d stands for \u201cobservation\nselection effect\u201d. Sober himself spells out OSE as\n\u201cWe exist, and if we exist, the constants must be right\u201d\n(2003: 44). According to this interpretation, \\(\\eqref{ose}\\) is\npatently false: our existence as living organisms entails that the\nconstants are right for life, which means that the terms on both sides\nof \\(\\eqref{ose}\\) are trivially \\(1\\) and hence equal, so\n\\(\\eqref{ose}\\) does not hold on Sober\u2019s analysis.\n\nCritics of the anthropic objection argue that Sober\u2019s reasoning\ndelivers highly implausible results when transferred to examples where\nrational inferences are less controversial. Most famous is\nLeslie\u2019s firing squad (Leslie 1989: 13f.), in which a prisoner\nexpects to be executed by a firing squad but, to his own surprise,\nfinds himself alive after all the marksmen have fired and wonders\nwhether they intended to miss. The firing squad scenario involves an\nobservation selection effect because the prisoner cannot contemplate\nhis post-execution situation unless he somehow survives the execution.\nHis observations, in other words, are \u201cbiased\u201d towards\nfinding himself alive (see Juhl [2007] and Kotzen [2012] for further\nuseful examples). Sober\u2019s analysis, applied to the firing squad\nscenario, suggests that it would not be rational for the prisoner to\nsuspect that the marksmen intended to miss (unless independent\nevidence suggests so) because that would mean overlooking the\nobservation selection effect that he faces. But, as Leslie, Weisberg\n(2005) and Kotzen (2012) argue, this recommendation seems very\nimplausible.\n\nAccording to Weisberg, Sober\u2019s analysis fails due to its\nincorrect identification of the observation selection effect\nOSE with \u201cWe exist, and if we exist, the constants must\nbe right\u201d. Weisberg argues that the weaker, purely conditional,\nstatement \u201cIf we exist, the constants must be right\u201d\n(Weisberg 2005: 819, Weisberg\u2019s wording differs) suffices to\ncapture the observation selection effect. But if we interpret\n\u201cOSE\u201d as this statement, there is no reason to\nsuppose that the inequality \\(\\eqref{ose}\\) fails and the argument\nfrom fine-tuning for design appears vindicated inasmuch as the\nanthropic objection is concerned. (See Sober 2009 for Sober\u2019s\nresponse.)\n\nTo resolve the difficulty of accommodating observation selection\neffects in likelihood arguments, Kotzen (2012) suggests that bias due\nto such effects be taken into account as evidence rather than\nbackground information. Notably, instead of \\(\\eqref{ose}\\) Kotzen\nproposes to consider  \n\\[\\begin{equation}\nP(R,I\\mid D) > P(R,I\\mid \\neg D)\\,, \\label{ose_kotzen}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(I\\) contains information about the observation process,\nincluding observation selection effects (Kotzen 2012: 835). According\nto this analysis, the argument from fine-tuning for design can be\nsaved from the anthropic objection for a variety of ways to spell out\nthe information \\(I\\) about the observation process and anthropic\nbias.\n",
