    "main_text": "The Emergence of Propositional Functions\n5. The Emergence of Propositional Functions\nThe term \u2018propositional function\u2019 appears in print for\nthe first time in Bertrand Russell's\nPrinciples of Mathematics (1903). Russell introduces the\nnotion through a discussion of kinds of propositions. Consider\npropositions of the type that says of something that it is a dog. This\nis the kind \u2018x is a dog\u2019. This kind is a\npropositional function that takes any object o to the\nproposition that o is a dog.\nIn this period, Russell holds that propositions are entities that\nhave individuals and properties and relations as constituents. The\nproposition that Socrates is a man has Socrates and the property of\nbeing a man as constituents. In complex propositions the relation\nbetween propositional function and the proposition is less\nclear. Like Frege, Russell allows the abstraction of a propositional\nfunction from any omission of an entity from a proposition. Thus, we\ncan view the proposition\n\n\nif Socrates drinks hemlock he will die \nas representing the application of the function\n\nx drinks hemlock \u2283 x will die \nto Socrates, or the function\n\nSocrates will drink x \u2283 Socrates will die\nto hemlock, and so on. In other words, Russell accepts the\nprinciple of multiple analyses.\nIn the Principles, the quantifier \u2018all\u2019 is analyzed as a\npart of referring phrases that pick out classes (1903, 72). This, we\ncan see, is a hold-over from the 19th Century extensional logicians\n(see Section 1). But in slightly later works, such as \u2018On\nDenoting\u2019 (1905), propositional functions are said to be\nconstituents of universal propositions. According to this analysis the\nproposition expressed by sentences such as \u2018All dogs bark\u2019 is made up\nof the propositional function x is a dog \u2283 x\nbarks and a function (of propositional functions) that is\nrepresented by the quantifier phrase \u2018all\u2019. Quantified propositions\nare interesting for us because they contain propositional functions as\nconstituents.\nIt is unclear whether Russell holds that propositional functions\nalso occur as constituents in singular propositions like\nif Socrates drinks hemlock he will die. These propositions do\ncontain properties, like\ndies, and relations, like drinks, but it is\ncontroversial as to whether Russell thinks that these are\npropositional functions (see Linsky 1999 and Landini 1998).\n",
