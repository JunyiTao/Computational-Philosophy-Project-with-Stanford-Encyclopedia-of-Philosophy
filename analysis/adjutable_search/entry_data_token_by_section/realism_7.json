Views which Undermine the Debate: Quietism\n\nSome of the ways in which non-realist theses about a particular\nsubject matter can be formulated and motivated have been described\nabove. Quietism is the view that significant metaphysical debate\nbetween realism and non-realism is impossible. Gideon Rosen nicely\narticulates the basic quietist thought:\n\nWe sense that there is a heady metaphysical thesis at stake\nin these debates over realism\u2014 \u2026 But after a point,\nwhen every attempt to say just what the issue is has come up empty, we\nhave no real choice but to conclude that despite all the\nwonderful,suggestive imagery, there is ultimately nothing in the\nneighborhood to discuss (1994: 279).Quietism about the\n\u2018debate\u2019 between realists and their opponents can take a\nnumber of forms. One form might claim that the idea of a significant\ndebate is generated by unsupported or unsupportable philosophical\ntheses about the relationship of the experiencing and minded subject\nto their world, and that once these theses are exorcised the\n\u2018debate\u2019 will gradually wither away. This form of quietism\nis often associated with the work of the later Wittgenstein, and\nreceives perhaps its most forceful development in the work of John\nMcDowell (see in particular McDowell 1994 and 2009). Other forms of\nquietism may proceed in a more piecemeal fashion, taking constraints\nsuch as Wright\u2019s realism-relevant Cruces and arguing on a\ncase-by-case basis that their satisfaction or non-satisfaction is of\nno metaphysical consequence. This is in fact the strategy pursued in\nRosen 1994. He makes the following points regarding the two\nrealism-relevant Cruces considered in the previous section.\n\nSuppose that:\n\n(F) It is a priori that: x is funny if and only if\nwe would judge x funny under conditions of full information\nabout xs relevant extra-comedic features \n\nand suppose that (F) satisfies (in addition to a prioricity) the\nvarious other constraints that Wright imposes on his provisional\nequations ((F) is actually not of the form of a provisional equation,\nbut this is not relevant to our purposes here). Rosen questions\nwhether this would be enough to establish that the facts about the\nfunny are in some metaphysically interesting sense \u2018less\nreal\u2019 or \u2018less objective\u2019 than facts (such as,\narguably, facts about shape) for which a suitable equation cannot be\nconstructed.\n\nIn a nutshell, Rosen\u2019s argument proceeds by inviting us to\nassume the perspective of an anthropologist who is studying us and who\n\u2018has gotten to the point where he can reliably determine which\njokes we will judge funny under conditions of full relevant\ninformation\u2019 (1994: 302). Rosen writes:\n\n[T]he important point is that from [the anthropologist\u2019s] point\nof view, the facts about the distribution of [the property denoted by\nour use of \u2018funny\u2019] are \u2018mind-dependent\u2019 only\nin the sense that they supervene directly on facts about our minds.\nBut again, this has no tendency to undermine their objectivity\n\u2026 [since] we have been given no reason to think that the facts\nabout what a certain group of people would think after a certain sort\nof investigation are anything but robustly objective (1994: composed\nfrom 300 and 302).\n\n\nHow plausible is this attempt to deflate the significance of the\ndiscovery that the subject matter of a particular area is, in\nWright\u2019s sense, judgement-dependent? Argument\u2014as opposed\nto the trading of intuitions\u2014at this level is difficult, but\nRosen\u2019s claim here is very implausible. Suppose we found out\nthat facts about the distribution of gases on the moons of Jupiter\nsupervened directly on facts about our minds. Would the threat we then\nfelt to the objectivity of facts about the distribution of gases on\nthe moons of Jupiter be at all assuaged by the reflection that facts\nabout the mental might themselves be susceptible to realistic\ntreatment? It seems doubtful. Fodor\u2019s Psychosemantics\nwould not offer much solace to realists in the world described in\nBerkeley\u2019s Principles. Rosen\u2019s claim derives some\nof its plausibility from the fact that he uses examples, such as the\nfunny and the constitutional, where our pre-theoretical attachment to\na realist view is very weak: it may be that the judgement-dependence\nof the funny doesn\u2019t undermine our sense of the objectivity of\nhumour simply because the level of objectivity we pretheoretically\nexpect of comedy is quite low. So although there is no knock-down\nargument to Rosen\u2019s claim, it is much more counterintuitive than\nhe might be willing to admit.\n\nRosen also questions whether there is any intuitive connection between\nconsiderations of width of cosmological role and issues of realism and\nnon-realism. Rosen doubts in particular that there is any tight\nconnection between facts of a certain class having only narrow\ncosmological role and mind-dependence in any sense relevant to the\nplausibility of realism. He writes:\n\nIt is possible to imagine a subtle physical property Q which,\nthough intuitively thoroughly objective, is nonetheless nomically\nconnected in the first instance only with brain state\nB\u2014where this happens to be the belief that things are\nQ. This peculiar discovery would not undermine our confidence\nthat Q was an objective feature of things, as it should if [a\nfeature of objects is less than fully objective if it has narrow\ncosmological role] (1994: 312).\n\n\nHowever it seems that, at least in the first instance, Wright has a\nrelatively quick response to this point at his disposal. Waiving the\npoint that in any case the width of cosmological role constraint\napplies to classes of properties and facts, he can point out\nthat in the example constructed by Rosen the narrowness of Q\u2019s\ncosmological role is an a posteriori matter. Whereas what we\nwant is that the narrowness of cosmological role is an a\npriori matter: one does not need to conduct an empirical\ninvestigation to convince oneself that facts about the funny fail to\nhave wide cosmological role.\n\nWright thus has the beginnings of answers to Rosen\u2019s quietist\nattack on his use of the notions of judgement-dependence and width of\ncosmological role. It is not possible to deal fully with these\narguments here, let alone with the other quietist arguments in\nRosen\u2019s paper, or the arguments of other quietists such as\nMcDowell, beyond giving a flavour of how quietism might be motivated\nand how those active in the debates between realists and their\nopponents might start to respond.
