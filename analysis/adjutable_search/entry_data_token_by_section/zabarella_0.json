    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nGiacomo (or Jacopo) Zabarella was born into an old and noble Paduan\nfamily on the 5th of September in 1533. From his father\nGiulio Zabarella he inherited the title of palatine count. Zabarella\nenjoyed a humanist education and entered the University of Padua,\nwhere he received the doctorate in 1553. Zabarella had many famous\nteachers, like Francesco Robortello in the humanities, Bernardino\nTomitano in logic, Marcantonio Genua in physics and metaphysics, and\nPietro Catena in mathematics. Unlike most of his contemporaries who\nhad studied natural philosophy, Zabarella never took a degree in\nmedicine. His entire teaching career was spent at his native\nuniversity. He began his career in 1564 when he obtained the first\nchair (or professorship) of logic succeeding Bernardino Tomitano. Five\nyears later he moved to the more prestigious and more lucrative second\nchair of the extraordinary professor of natural philosophy. In 1577 he\nwas promoted to the first extraordinary chair of natural\nphilosophy. Finally, in 1585, Zabarella obtained the second ordinary\nchair of natural philosophy, which he held until his death. The\nstatutes of the University of Padua prevented him, as a native Paduan,\nfrom obtaining the first ordinary chair in natural\nphilosophy. Zabarella died at the age of 56 on the 15th of\nOctober in 1589.\n\n\nThe publications of Zabarella reflect his teaching in the Aristotelian\ntradition. The first of his publications was Opera logica,\nwhich appeared in Venice in 1578. Zabarella had time to write this\ncollection of logical works in 1576, when a plague raged in Veneto\nsending Zabarella into the countryside with his family.  This was one\nof the very few times in his life when he left the city of\nPadua. Zabarella\u2019s next published work, Tabula logicae, came\nout two years later and his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Posterior\nAnalytics appeared in 1582. De doctrinae ordine\napologia, which appeared in 1584, was a reply to Francesco\nPiccolomini who had criticised Zabarella\u2019s ideas on logic. The first\nof Zabarella\u2019s works in natural philosophy, De naturalis scientiae\nconstitutione, came out in 1586. This introduction to the field\nwas connected to his major opus in natural philosophy, De rebus\nnaturalibus, the first edition of which was published\nposthumously in 1590. It contained 30 different treatises on\nAristotelian natural philosophy and Zabarella wrote the introduction\nof the book only few weeks before his death. Zabarella\u2019s two sons\nedited his two incomplete commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s texts, which\nwere also published posthumously: the commentary on Physics\n(1601) and the commentary on On the Soul (1605) (Mikkeli\n1992, p. 19).\n\n\nGiacomo Zabarella followed a very systematic style of writing in his\npublications. His idea was to build a coherent body of Aristotelian\nlogic and natural philosophy. Therefore he was also interested in the\nclassification of the disciplines and the relationships between\nvarious areas of academic learning. His use of Aristotle and other\nauthorities was both eclectic and critical. Zabarella\u2019s sources thus\nincluded newly recovered Greek commentators such as Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Philoponus, Simplicius and Themistius, as well as\nmedieval commentators such as Thomas Aquinas, Walter Burley and\nAverroes. In Zabarella\u2019s view, Averroes, unlike his followers,\naccurately understood Aristotle\u2019s philosophy despite not knowing the\nthe original texts or even the Greek language (Martin 2007,\np. 15). Zabarella himself read Greek and could therefore consult the\nGreek text of Aristotle and the commentators. He devoted much effort\nto presenting what he considered to be the true meaning of Aristotle\u2019s\ntexts. However, he resisted the tendency of the humanists to expunge\nall medieval barbarisms, preferring philosophical precision to\nclassical elegance (W.R. Laird 2000, p. 695).\n",
