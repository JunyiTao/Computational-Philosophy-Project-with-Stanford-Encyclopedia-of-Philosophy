Anaxagoras\u2019 Influence\n\n\nReportedly the first of the Presocratic philosophers to settle\nin Athens, Anaxagoras was a significant figure, not only for later\nphilosophical thinkers, but also for the wider civic culture of his\ntime. He was clearly an important influence on Pericles.\nPlutarch reports:\n\n\nBut Anaxagoras of Clazomenae was the one who most associated with\nPericles and who most bestowed on him that dignity and wisdom more\nweighty than demagoguery, and on the whole raised up and exalted the\nworthiness of his character \u2026These are not the only advantages\nthat Pericles enjoyed because of his connection with Anaxagoras. It\nseems that Pericles rose above superstition, that attitude of\nastonishment about celestial occurrences which is produced in those\nwho are ignorant about the causes of things and who are crazed by\ndivinity and divine interventions because of their inexperience in\nthese areas. Natural philosophy substitutes for festering superstition\nthat unshaken piety that is attended by good hopes. (A15,\nA16)\n\n\nThat naturalism appears in the dramas of Euripides, who is often\ndescribed as a pupil of Anaxagoras, and in the comedies of\nAristophanes, who satirizes the views of Anaxagoras as well as the\nfigure of Socrates in Clouds. Anaxagoras\u2019 theory\nof the floods of the Nile was known to Herodotus (and may be referred\nto in Aeschylus). Despite stories that they did not get along,\nthere are signs of influence of Anaxagoras on Democritus (in his\naccounts of perception and knowledge) and Anaxagoras\u2019 scientific\nclaims and discoveries affected all the thinkers of his time.\nOnce his views about meteors, hail, and eclipses became known, such\ntopics were always included in scientific accounts of astronomical and\nmeteorological phenomena. In the testimonia, Anaxagoras\u2019\neven temperament was taken as a model of good behavior, and he was\nfamous as a prognosticator of everything from meteor falls to rain\nshowers. \n\n\nAnaxagoras\u2019 views appear among Socrates\u2019 survey of\nprevious naturalistic theories of explanation (Phaedo 96a6\nff.). More ominously, Meletus seems to have attributed Anaxagoras\u2019\nclaims about the earthy nature of the moon and stars to Socrates at his\ntrial (see Plato\u2019s Apology 26e7ff., 59 A35). Although\nAnaxagoras\u2019 alleged indictment for impiety was probably as much political\nas a sign of his danger to public religion (attacking Anaxagoras was an\nindirect attack on Pericles), he was seen as important and influential\nenough to qualify to some as an enemy of the polis.\n\n\nPhilosophically, Anaxagoras\u2019 theories were also widely known and\ninfluential. Some scholars have thought that the author of the Derveni\nPapyrus (found in Northern Greece) was familiar with Anaxagoras\u2019\ntheories (Betegh 2004; Kouremenos et al. 2006), and once he introduced\nMind as a cause, other thinkers followed him. Diogenes of Apollonia\nclaimed that air (as mind and god) directs all things. Zeno of Elea\n(perhaps) and Melissus (certainly) criticize his theory. Anaxagoras\u2019\nview that \u201ceach one is and was most manifestly those things of\nwhich there are the most in it\u201d (the principle of Predominance)\nis echoed in Plato\u2019s claims that sensible things acquire their\ncharacters and names from the Forms in which they participate\n(Phaedo 102a10 ff.). Plato even adopts Anaxagoras\u2019 language\nof sharing or participating in (see Furley 2002), and like Anaxagoras\u2019 nous,\nPlatonic forms are \u201cthemselves by themselves\u201d in being\nself-explanatory (see Herrmann, 2007). Aristotle, although impatient\nwith the gaps in Anaxagoras\u2019 account of nous, expresses\nadmiration for his recognition that mind has a role to play in guiding\nthe cosmos, and he treats Anaxagoras\u2019 explanation of eclipses as a\nmodel of scientific explanation.\n",
