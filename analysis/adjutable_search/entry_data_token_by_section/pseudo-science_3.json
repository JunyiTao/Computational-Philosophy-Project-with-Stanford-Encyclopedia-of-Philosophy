The foremost modern classic on the\nsubject (Gardner 1957) bears the title Fads and Fallacies in the\nName of Science. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438),\n\u201c[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they\nmasquerade as genuinely scientific ones.\u201d These and many other\nauthors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching\nhas to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996):\n\n(1)\nit is not scientific, and\n(2)\nits major proponents try to create the impression that it is\nscientific. \n\n\nThe former of the two criteria is central to the concerns of the\nphilosophy of science. Its precise meaning has been the subject of\nimportant controversies among philosophers, to be discussed below in\nSection 4.  The second criterion has been less discussed by philosophers,\nbut it needs careful treatment not least since many discussions of\npseudoscience (in and out of philosophy) have been confused due to\ninsufficient attention to it. Proponents of pseudoscience often\nattempt to mimic science by arranging conferences, journals, and\nassociations that share many of the superficial characteristics of\nscience, but do not satisfy its quality criteria. Naomi Oreskes (2019)\ncalled this phenomenon \u201cfacsimile science\u201d. Blancke and\ncoworkers (2017) called it \u201ccultural mimicry of\nscience\u201d.\n",
