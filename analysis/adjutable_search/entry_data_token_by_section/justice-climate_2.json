Intergenerational Justice\n\nThe question of what climate target to aim for will also depend on\nwhat responsibilities members of one generation have to future\ngenerations. The emission of some greenhouse gases can have an impact\nfar into the future. For example, CO2 lasts in the\natmosphere for \u201chundreds of thousands of years\u201d (Allen,\nDube, & Solecki 2019: 64). So while climate change affects large\nnumbers of people alive now, many of the impacts of climate change\nwill fall on future generations. To know what temperature target is\nappropriate it is necessary, then, to have an account of our\nresponsibilities to future generations and to know how much weight, if\nany, to attribute to their interests.\n\nSuch an account is also needed for two further reasons. First, the\nquestion of who should bear the burdens of climate change has an\nintergenerational dimension. Some, for example, have argued that it\nwould be fair to impose some of the costs of mitigating (and adapting\nto) climate change on future generations (Rendall 2011).\n\nFinally, there is a fixed quantity of greenhouse gases which can be\n emitted.[2]\n Considering how this should be shared also raises questions of\nintergenerational justice for if there is a fixed greenhouse gas\nbudget we need to consider what claims, if any, future people have to\nemit greenhouse gases.\n",
