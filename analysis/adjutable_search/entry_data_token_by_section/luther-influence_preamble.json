    "main_text": "\n\nThe aim of this entry is to outline the impact of Martin Luther\n(1483\u20131546) on the philosophical tradition which came after him.\nThe Protestant Reformation as a whole undoubtedly had considerable\ninfluence in philosophy and not just theology, not least because many\nkey philosophical figures were themselves part of this religious\nheritage in its various forms, as well as being caught up in the major\nsocial and political changes and conflicts that the Reformation\nunleashed. However, to trace the influence of Luther himself\nspecifically is a more complex exercise, in part because other central\nReformation figures such as Philip Melanchthon (1497\u20131560) and\nJohn Calvin (1509\u201364) had their own\nimpact;[1] at\nthe same time, the Reformation itself took on a range of different\nforms even in Luther\u2019s own lifetime and more strongly\nafterwards, many of which departed from Luther himself on key issues,\ndespite various attempts to arrive at some uniformity of doctrine.\nThis complexity, combined with the feeling that Luther was in some\nsense an \u201canti-philosopher\u201d because of his hostile remarks\nconcerning the discipline, Aristotle, and reason, have led\nLuther\u2019s influence within philosophy to be rather\nneglected.[2]\nNonetheless, the impact of his thinking on \u201cmodernity\u201d\nmore generally has been much discussed (see \u00a76), while recent\nscholarship has suggested it is a mistake to neglect Luther\u2019s\ninfluence on philosophy more narrowly conceived, and that the\ndiscussion of his ideas (both positively and critically) can be seen\nto mark the philosophical tradition from the early modern period\nonwards in a distinctive way (see \u00a7\u00a71\u20135). Naturally\nenough, this impact takes place most obviously in the countries of\nnorthern Europe, where the Reformation generally was spread most\neffectively.[3]\n",
