    "main_text": "Logical Approaches || Preferential Logics\n5.6 Preferential Logics\n\nCircumscription is a special case of a wider class of defeasible\nlogics, the preferential logics (Shoham 1987). In\npreferential logics, \\(\\Gamma \\dproves p\\) iff \\(p\\) is true in all of the most\npreferred models of \\(\\Gamma\\). In the case of circumscription, the\nmost preferred models are those that minimize the extension of certain\npredicates, but many other kinds of preference relations can be used\ninstead, so long as the preference relations are transitive and\nirreflexive (a strict partial order). A structure consisting of a set\nof models of a propositional or first-order language, together with a\npreference order on those models, is called a preferential\nstructure. The symbol \\(\\prec\\) shall represent the preference\nrelation. \\(M \\prec M'\\) means that \\(M\\)\nis strictly preferred to \\(M'\\). A most preferred model is\none that is minimal in the ordering.\n\nIn order to give rise to a cumulative logic (one that satisfies Cut\nand Cautious Monotony), we must add an additional condition to the\npreferential structures, a Limit Assumption (also known as the\ncondition of stopperedness or smoothness:\n\nLimit Assumption: Given a theory \\(T\\), and\n\\(M\\), a non-minimal model of \\(T\\), there exists a model\n\\(M'\\) which is preferred to \\(M\\) and which is a\nminimal model of \\(T\\).\n\nThe Limit Assumption is satisfied if the preferential structure does\nnot contain any infinite descending chains of more and more preferred\nmodels, with no minimal member. This is a difficult condition to\nmotivate as natural, but without it, we can find preferential\nstructures that give rise to nonmonotonic consequence relations that\nfail to be cumulative.\n\nOnce we have added the Limit Assumption, it is easy to show that any\nconsequence relation based upon a preferential model is not only\ncumulative but also supraclassical, strongly absorptive, and\ndistributive. Let\u2019s call such logics preferential. In\nfact, Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor (Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor 1990;\nMakinson 1994, 77; Makinson 2005, PAGE) proved the following\nrepresentation theorem for preferential logics:\n\nRepresentation Theorem for Preferential Logics: if\n\\(\\dproves\\) is a cumulative, supraclassical, strongly absorptive, and\ndistributive consequence relation (i.e., a preferential relation) then\nthere is a preferential structure \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) satisfying the Limit\nAssumption such that for all finite theories \\(T\\), the set\nof \\(\\dproves\\) -consequences of \\(T\\) is exactly the set of formulas\ntrue in every preferred model of \\(T\\)\n in M.[3]\n\nThere are preferential logics that fail to satisfy consistency\npreservation, as well as disjunctive rationality and rational\nmonotony:\n\nDisjunctive Rationality:\nIf \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{p\\} \\notdproves r\\), and \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{q\\}\n\\notdproves r\\), then \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{(p \\vee q)\\} \\notdproves\nr\\).\n\nRational Monotony: \nIf \\(\\Gamma \\dproves p\\), then either \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{q\\} \\dproves p\\)\nor \\(\\Gamma \\dproves \\neg q\\).\n\nA very natural condition has been found by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor\nthat corresponds to Rational Monotony: that of ranked models.\n(No condition on preference structures has been found that ensures\ndisjunctive rationality without also ensuring rational monotony.) A\npreferential structure \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) satisfies the\nRanked Models condition just in case there is a function \\(r\\)\nthat assigns an ordinal number to each model in such a way that\n\\(M \\prec M'\\) iff \\(r(M) \\lt r(M')\\). Let\u2019s say that a preferential\nconsequence relation is a rational relation just in case it\nsatisfies Rational Monotony, and that a preferential structure is a\nrational structure just in case it satisfies the ranked\nmodels condition. Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor (Kraus, Lehmann, and\nMagidor 1990; Makinson 1994, 71\u201381) also proved the following\nrepresentation theorem:\n\nRepresentation Theorem for Rational Logics: if\n\\(\\dproves\\) is a rational consequence relation (i.e., a preferential\nrelation that satisfies Rational Monotony) then there is a\npreferential structure \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) satisfying the Limit Assumption\nand the Ranked Models Assumption such that for all finite theories\n\\(T\\), the set of \\(\\dproves\\) -consequences of \\(T\\) is exactly the\nset of formulas true in every preferred model of \\(T\\) in\n\\(\\mathcal{M}\\).\n\nFreund proved an analogous representation result for preferential\nlogics that satisfy disjunctive rationality, replacing the\nranking condition with a weaker condition of filtered models:\na filtered model is one such that, for every formula, if two worlds\nnon-minimally satisfy the formula, then there is a world less than\nboth of them that also satisfies the formula (Freund 1993).\n",
