    "main_text": "What is Clinical Research?\n1. What is Clinical Research?\n\nHuman subjects research is research which studies humans, as opposed\nto animals, atoms, or asteroids. Assessment of whether humans prefer\n100 dollars or a 1% chance of 10,000 dollars constitutes human\nsubjects research. Clinical research refers to the subset of human\nsubjects research that evaluates the impact interventions have on\nhuman beings with the goal of assessing whether they might help to\nimprove human health and well-being. The present analysis focuses on\nresearch that is designed to improve human health and well-being by\nidentifying better methods to treat, cure or prevent illness or\ndisease. This focus is intended to bracket the question of whether\nresearch on enhancements that might increase our well-being by making\nus better than normal, allowing us to remember more or worry less,\nwithout treating, curing, or preventing illness or disease\nqualifies as clinical research.\n\nWe shall also bracket the question of whether quality improvement and\nquality assurance projects qualify as clinical research. To briefly\nconsider the type of research at the heart of this debate, consider a\nhospital which proposes to evaluate the impact of checklists on the\nquality of patient care. Half the nurses in the hospital are told to\ncontinue to provide care as usual; the other half are provided with a\nchecklist and instructed to mechanically check off each item as they\ncomplete it when caring for their patients. The question of whether\nthis activity constitutes clinical research is of theoretical interest\nas a means to clarifying the precise boundaries of the concept. Should\nwe say that this is not clinical research because the checklist is\nused by the nurses, not administered to the patients? Or should we say\nthis is clinical research because it involves the systematic testing\nof a hypothesis which is answered by collecting data on patient\noutcomes? The answer has significant practical implications,\ndetermining whether these activities must satisfy existing regulations\nfor clinical research, including whether the clinicians need to obtain\npatients\u2019 informed consent before the nurses taking care of them\ncan use the checklist.\n\nWhile clinical medicine is enormously better than it was 100 or even\n50 years ago, there remain many diseases against which current\nclinical medicine offers an inadequate response. To name just a few,\nmalaria kills over a million people, mostly children, every year;\nchronic diseases, chief among them heart disease and stroke, kill\nmillions each year, and there still are no effective treatments for\nAlzheimer disease. The social value of clinical research lies in its\nability to collect information that might be useful for identifying\nimproved methods to address these conditions. Yet, it is the\nrare  study which definitively establishes that a particular\nmethod is effective and safe for treating, curing or preventing some\nillness. The success of specific research studies more commonly lies\nin the gathering of information that, together with the results of\nmany other studies, may yield these improvements. For example,\nprior to establishing the efficacy of a new treatment for a given\ncondition, researchers typically need to identify the cause of the\ncondition, possible mechanisms for treating it, a safe and effective\ndose, and ways of testing whether the drug alters the course of the\ndisease.\n\nThe process of testing potential new treatments can take 10\u201315 years,\nand is standardly divided into phases. Formalized phase 0 studies are\na relatively recent phenomenon involving the testing of interventions\nand methods which might be used in later phase studies. A phase 0\nstudy might be designed to determine the mechanism of action of a\nparticular drug and evaluate different ways to administer it. Phase 1\nstudies are the earliest tests of a new intervention and are conducted\nin small numbers of individuals. Phase 1 studies are designed to\nevaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of new treatments,\nessentially evaluating how the drug influences the human body and how\nthe human body influences the drug. Phase 1 studies also evaluate the\nrisks of the treatment and attempt to identify an appropriate dose to\nbe used in subsequent phase 2 studies. Phase 1 studies pose risks and\nfrequently offer little if any potential for clinical benefit to\nparticipants. As a result, a significant amount of the ethical concern\nover clinical research focuses on phase 1 studies.\n\nIf phase 1 testing is successful, potential new treatments go on to\nlarger phase 2 studies which are designed to further assess risks and\nalso to evaluate whether there is any evidence that the treatment\nmight be beneficial. Successful phase 2 studies are followed by phase\n3 studies which involve hundreds, sometimes thousands of patients.\nPhase 3 studies are designed to provide a rigorous test of the\nefficacy of a treatment and frequently involve randomization of\nparticipants to the new treatment or a control, which might be the\ncurrent treatment or a placebo. Finally, post-marketing or phase 4\nstudies evaluate the use of interventions in clinical practice.\n\nThe first three phases of clinical trials typically include\npurely research procedures, such as blood draws, imaging scans, or\nbiopsies, that are included in the study to collect data regarding the\ntreatment under study. Analysis of the central ethical challenge posed\nby clinical research thus focuses on three related risk-benefit\nprofiles: (a) the risk-benefit profile of the interventions(s) under\nstudy; (b) the risk-benefit profile of the included research\nprocedures; and (c) the risk-benefit profile of the study as a\nwhole.\n\nIn some cases, receipt of potential new treatments is in the ex ante\ninterests of research participants. For example, the risks posed by an\nexperimental cancer treatment might be justified by the possibility\nthat it will extend participants\u2019 lives. Moreover, the\nrisk/benefit profile of the treatment might be as favorable for\nparticipants as the risk/benefit profile of the available\nalternatives. In these cases, receipt of the experimental intervention\nex ante promotes participants\u2019 interests. In other cases,\nparticipation in research poses \u2018net\u2019 risks, that is,\nrisks of harm which are not, or not entirely, justified by potential\nclinical benefits to individual participants. A first in human trial\nof an experimental treatment might involve a single dose to see\nwhether humans can tolerate it. And it might occur in healthy\nindividuals who have no need of treatment. These studies pose risks to\nparticipants and offer essentially no chance for clinical benefit. The\nqualifier to \u2018essentially\u2019 no chance of clinical benefit\nis intended to capture the fact that the research procedures included\nin clinical trials may inadvertently end up providing some clinical\nbenefit to some participants. For example, a biopsy that is used to\ncollect research data may disclose a previously unidentified and\ntreatable condition. The chance for such benefit, albeit real, is\ntypically so remote that it is not sufficient to compensate for the\nrisks of the procedure. Whether a study as a whole poses net risks\ndepends on whether the potential benefits of the experimental\nintervention compensate for its risks plus the net risks of the\nresearch procedures included in the study.\n\nClinical research which poses net risks raises important ethical\nconcern. Net-risk studies raise concern that participants are being\nused as mere means to collect information to benefit future patients.\nResearch procedures that pose net risks may seem to raise less concern\nwhen they are embedded within a study which offers a favorable\nrisk-benefit profile overall. Yet, since these procedures pose net\nrisks, and since the investigators could provide participants with the\nnew potential treatment alone, they require justification. An\ninvestigator who is about to insert a needle into a research\nparticipant to obtain some blood purely for laboratory purposes faces\nthe question of whether doing so is ethically justified, even when the\nprocedure is included in a study that offers participants the\npotential for important medical benefit. The goal of ethical analyses\nof clinical research is to provide an answer.\n\nClinical research poses three types of net risks: absolute, relative,\nand indirect (Rid and Wendler 2011). Absolute net risks arise when the\nrisks of an intervention or procedure are not justified by its\npotential clinical benefits. Most commentators focus on this\npossibility with respect to research procedures which pose some risks\nand offer (essentially) no chance of clinical benefit, such as blood\ndraws to obtain cells for laboratory studies. Research with healthy\nvolunteers is another example which frequently offers no chance for\nclinical benefit. Clinical research also poses absolute net risks when\nit offers a chance for clinical benefit which is not sufficient to\njustify the risks participants face. A kidney biopsy to obtain tissue\nfrom presumed healthy volunteers may offer some very low chance of\nidentifying an unrecognized and treatable pathology. This intervention\nnonetheless poses net risks if the chance for clinical benefit for the\nparticipants is not sufficient to justify the risks of their\nundergoing the biopsy.\n\nRelative net risks arise when the risks of a research intervention are\njustified by its potential clinical benefits, but the\nintervention\u2019s risk-benefit profile is less favorable than the\nrisk-benefit profile of one or more available alternatives. Imagine\nthat investigators propose a randomized, controlled trial to compare\nan inexpensive drug against an expensive and somewhat more effective\ndrug. Such trials make sense when, in the absence of a direct\ncomparison, it is unclear whether the increased effectiveness of the\nmore expensive drug justifies its costs. In this case, receipt of the\ncheaper drug would be contrary to participants\u2019 interest in\ncomparison to receiving the more expensive drug. The trial thus poses\nrelative net risks to participants.\n\nIndirect net risks arise when a research intervention has a favorable\nrisk-benefit profile, but the intervention diminishes the risk-benefit\nprofile of other interventions provided as part of or in parallel to\nthe study. For example, an experimental drug for cancer might\nundermine the effectiveness of other drugs individuals are taking for\ntheir condition. The risks of research participation can be compounded\nif the indicated response to the harm in question poses additional\nrisks. Kidney damage suffered as the result of research participation\nmight lead to the need for short-term dialysis which poses additional\nrisks to the individual; a participant who experiences a postlumbar\npuncture headache might need a \u2018blood patch\u2019 which poses\nsome risk of blood entering the epidural space which would call for a\nfurther response which carries additional risks. While commentators\ntend to focus on the risks of physical harm, participation in clinical\nresearch can pose other types of risks as well, including\npsychological, economic, and social risks. Depending on the study and\nthe circumstances, individuals who are injured as the result of\nparticipating in research might incur significant expenses. Most\nguidelines and regulations stipulate that evaluation of the\nacceptability of clinical research studies should take into account\nall the different risks to which participants are exposed.\n\nTo assess the ethics of exposing research participants to risks, one\nneeds an account of why exposing others to risks raises ethical\nconcern in the first place. Being exposed to risks obviously raises\nconcern to the extent that the potential harm to which the risk refers\nis realized: the chance of a headache turns into an actual headache.\nBeing exposed to risks also can lead to negative consequences as a\nresult of the recognition that one is at risk of harm. Individuals who\nrecognize that they face a risk may become frightened; they also may\ntake costly or burdensome measures to protect themselves. In contrast,\nthe literature on the ethics of clinical research implicitly assumes\nthat being exposed to risks is not per se harmful. The mere fact that\nparticipants are exposed to risks is not regarded as necessarily\ncontrary to their interests. It depends on whether the risk is\nrealized in an actual harm.\n\nIt is one thing to expose a consenting adult to risks to save the\nhealth or life of an identified and present other, particularly when\nthe two individuals are first degree relatives. It is another thing,\nor seems to many to be another thing, to expose consenting individuals\nto risks to help unknown and unidentified, and possibly future others.\nAlmost no one objects to operating on a healthy, consenting adult to\nobtain a kidney that might save a present and ailing sibling,\neven though the operation poses some risk of serious harm and offers\nthe donor no potential for clinical benefit. Attempts to obtain a\nkidney from a healthy, consenting adult and give it to an unidentified\nindividual are met with greater ethical concern. The extent of the\nconcern increases as the path from risk exposure to benefit becomes\nlonger and more tenuous. Many clinical research studies expose\nparticipants to risks in order to collect generalizable information\nwhich, if combined with the results of other, as yet non-existent\nstudies, may eventually benefit future patients through the\nidentification of a new intervention, assuming the appropriate\nregulatory authorities approve it, some company or group chooses to\nmanufacture it, and patients can afford to purchase it. The potential\nbenefits of clinical research may thus be realized someday, but the\nrisks and burdens are clear and present.\n\nIncreasingly, researchers obtain and store human biological\nsamples for use in future research studies. These studies raise\nimportant questions regarding what might be called\n\u2018contribution\u2019 and \u2018information\u2019 risks. The\nformer question concerns the conditions under which it is acceptable\nto ask individuals to contribute to answering the scientific question\nposed by a given study (Jonas 1969). The fact that this question has\nbeen ignored by many commentators and regulations may trace to an\noverly narrow understanding of individuals\u2019 interests.\nIndividuals undoubtedly have an interest in avoiding the kinds of\nphysical harms, pain, infection, loss of organ function,\nthat they face in clinical research. This leaves the question of\nwhether individuals\u2019 interests are implicated, and whether they\ncan be set back, by contributing to particular projects,\nactivities and goals?\n\nConsider the routine practice of storing leftover samples of\nparticipants\u2019 blood for use in future research projects.\nFor the purposes of protecting participants\u2019 interests, does it\nmatter what goals these future studies attempt to advance? Can\nindividuals be harmed if their samples are used to promote\ngoals which conflict with their fundamental values? For\nexample, are the interests of individuals who fundamentally\noppose cloning set back if their samples are used in a\nstudy that successfully identifies improved methods to clone human\nbeings?\n\nThe possibility of information risks garnered significant\nattention when investigators used DNA samples obtained from members of\nthe Havasupai tribe in Arizona to study \u201ctheories of the\ntribe\u2019s geographical origins.\u201d The study\u2019s\nconclusion that early members of the tribe had migrated from Asia\nacross the Bering Strait contradicted the tribe\u2019s own views that\nthey originated in the Grand Canyon (Harmon 2010). Can learning the\ntruth, in this case the origins of one\u2019s tribal group, harm\nresearch participants?\n\nAttempts to determine when it is acceptable to expose participant to\nrisks for the benefit of others, including future others who do not\nyet exist, have been significantly influenced by its history, by how\nit has been conducted and, in particular, by how it has been\nmisconducted (Lederer 1995; Beecher 1966). Thus, to understand the\ncurrent state of the ethics of clinical research, it is useful to know\nsomething of its past.\n",
