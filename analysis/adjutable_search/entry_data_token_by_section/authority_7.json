    "main_text": "The Puzzle of Political Authority: Philosophical Anarchism || Instrumentalism about Legitimate Political Authority\n3.1 Instrumentalism about Legitimate Political Authority\n\n\nOne can see different accounts of the legitimacy of political\nauthority as responses to the anarchist challenge. Let us start with\nthe instrumentalist account of legitimacy. The canonical statement of\nthis notion of legitimate authority is provided by Joseph Raz. He calls\nit the Normal Justification Thesis. It asserts that \u201cthe normal\nway to establish that a person has authority over another person\ninvolves showing that the alleged subject is likely better to comply\nwith reasons which apply to him (other than the alleged authoritative\ndirectives) if he accepts the directives of the alleged authority as\nauthoritatively binding and tries to follow them, rather than by trying\nto follow the reasons which apply to him directly.\u201d (Raz\n1986)\n\n\nThis conception of the legitimacy of authority flows from the idea\nthat \u201cauthoritative directives should be based on reasons which\nalready independently apply to the subjects of the directives and are\nrelevant to their action in the circumstances covered by the\ndirective\u201d (Raz 1986.) According to Raz, what should guide\ngovernment decisions about what commands to give subjects is what the\nsubjects already have reason to do. For instance, subjects already have\nreason to give a fair share of resources for the common good.\nAuthorities merely help them comply with these reasons by establishing\nan efficient and fair system of taxation. Subjects have reason to\ndefend their fellow countrymen and authorities help them do this by\nestablishing an army in an efficient and fair way. Authorities do these\nthings by issuing commands to subjects that are meant to replace the\nreasons that already apply to the subjects. Instead of the subject\ntrying to figure out exactly how much he owes and who to give it to by\ncoordinating it with many other people, the authority simply takes over\nthese tasks, determines what the subject has reason to do and expects\nthe subject to take its authoritative command as a reason instead of\nthe reasons that directly apply to the action. An authority does its\njob well and is therefore legitimate when it enables subjects to act\nbetter on the reasons that apply to them when they take the commands as\ngiving them preemptive reasons.\n\n\nAn instrumentalist attempts to meet Wolff's challenge by saying that\nan authority is legitimate when one complies better with one's duty\noverall by submission to authority than by trying to act on the basis\nof one's own assessments of what is right and wrong in each instance.\nThis amounts to a rejection of the duty of autonomy that is central to\nthe anarchist idea. Or at least it is a rejection of the idea that the\nduty of autonomy is the most fundamental duty. But it does get at\nsomething important. Wolff's challenge states in a rather general way\nthe worry that there is something immoral about failing to critically\nreflect about what one ought to do in each instance of action. And he\nstates that submitting to the commands of the state is precisely a case\nof failing to act on one's critical assessment of a situation. The\ninstrumentalist suggests a way in which it is not immoral to fail to\ncritically reflect on one's prospective actions in each instance.\nIndeed, the instrumentalist can argue that it is sometimes immoral to\ninsist on critically reflecting and acting autonomously when one may\nactually act worse as a result of consistently critically reflecting.\nWe frequently act on the basis of rules of action, without considering\nall the details of the circumstances in which we act on the grounds\nthat trying to take all the details of each situation into account for\neach action would produce bad decisions. The instrumentalist argues\nthat we ought to take this kind of attitude to the commands of the\nstate when we will better act in accordance with our duty overall by\ndoing so than by attempting to make independent assessments of the\nworth of our actions in every case (see Raz 1986, ch. 3.)\n\n\nThis response to the philosophical anarchist challenge establishes\nonly a piecemeal duty to obey the state. The instrumentalist argues\nthat some states some of the time issue commands that we (or at least\nsome individuals) ought to submit to without critical reflection on\neach command. It does not imply that the duty to obey the state extends\nto all commands of the state and to all subjects. It only applies when\nthe subject would likely better comply with duties overall by treating\nthe commands as authoritative (i.e. establishing content independent\nand preemptive duties to obey the commands) than by acting on the basis\nof an independent assessment of the rightness of each action. Whether\nthe commands impose duties or not depends on features of the subject\nsuch as his or her knowledge of the issues related to the commands and\nso forth.\n\n\nOf course, it is important to note that not every act of obedience\nwill ensure better compliance with reason, there will be cases when the\ncommands of the state do not accord with the best reasons. Raz's\nconception of authority depends for its cogency on the thought that as\nlong as the subject does better by reason overall by obeying certain\nclasses of commands, the subject has a duty to obey every one of the\ncommands: the correct as well as the incorrect. In some sense, the\nobedience to the commands has a greater likelihood of ensuring\nconformity with reason. Finally, this particular account of the duty to\nobey does not assert that the discharging of the duties is owed to the\nstate. This account does not establish any fundamental right to rule on\nthe part of the state.\n",
