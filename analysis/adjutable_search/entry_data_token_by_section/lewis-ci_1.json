Overview of Conceptual Pragmatism\n\nIn MWO, Lewis (1929, Chp. 1) argued that the proper method of\nphilosophy isn\u2019t transcendental but reflective. Philosophy seeks\nto elicit the criteria or principles of the real, the right, the\nbeautiful, and the logically valid that are implicit in human\nexperience, thought, and activity. \n\nLewis (1929, 37\u20138) believed that, on reflection and analysis, we\ncan distinguish three elements in perceptual knowledge: (1) the given\nor immediate data of sense, (2) the act of interpreting the given as\nan experience of one sort of thing as opposed to another, and (3) the\nconcept by which we so interpret the given by relating it to other\npossibilities of experience. Our experience of the real is not given\nto us in experience but is constructed by us from the data of sense\nthrough acts of interpretation. When I know that I am looking at a\ntable and reflect on my experience, I realize, on analysis, that there\nare certain highly specific sensuous qualities presented to me that I\nam immediately aware of. Moreover, I realize that, in the light of\nthis and other experiences I recall, I expect, with some likelihood, I\nwould have certain other experiences, e.g. of feeling something\napparently hard, were I to have the experience of performing certain\nacts, e.g. of reaching out with my hand. In doing so, it is the\nconcept of seeing a table that I am applying to my experience rather\nthan that of seeing a horse or that of hallucinating a table, either\nof which would have involved different expectations of experience\nconsequent upon action. Only an active being can therefore have\nknowledge, and the principal function of empirical knowledge \u201cis\nthat of an instrument enabling transition from the actual present to a\nfuture which is desired and which the present is believed to\nsignalize\u201d (Lewis 1946, 4).\n\nStatements expressing our beliefs about reality are translatable into,\nand thus entail and are entailed by, an indefinitely large set of\ncounterfactual statements about what experiences we would have or\nwould be likely to have, were we to be presented with certain sensory\ncues and were we to carry out further tests (Lewis 1929, 142; 1946,\n180, 208). Objectively, what we actually experience may depend on the\nphysical circumstances of perception, e.g. lighting conditions, and\nthe bodily actions we perform, e.g. moving our eyes, as well, of\ncourse, as the character of objects in our environment. However, what\nmatters ultimately for the meaning and confirmation of statements\nabout objective reality, as Lewis makes clear in AKV, are only the\n\u201cfelt experience\u201d of action and the directly presentable\nsense experiences contained in sensory cues and forming the\nexperiential circumstances of action (Lewis 1946, 178\u20139,\n245\u20136), as well, of course, as the directly presentable sense\nexperiences they lead us to expect. The idea of a reality neither\nconfirmable nor disconfirmable in principle by experience was thus for\nLewis without meaning. What distinguished his view, he thought, from\nthe superficially similar verification principle of meaning of the\nlogical positivists was his emphasis on the mediating role of agency\n(Lewis 1941a, in Lewis 1970, 94). \n\nWhether our objective beliefs are true depends on their verifiable or\nconfirmable implications for future possible experience. However, in\norder to guide action effectively now while saving us from the hazards\nof action without foresight, empirical belief and its expectations for\nexperience must be justified (rationally credible, warranted) now,\nantecedent to future verification (Lewis 1946, 254\u20137).\nJustification, as opposed to verification, is the focus of AKV much\nmore so than MWO. Nonetheless, throughout Lewis\u2019 career from MWO\nto the end, there are common claims. First, empirical knowledge\n(rationally credible, justified, or warranted belief) is probable\nknowledge or belief. Second, probability is a logical or inferential\nrelation between a conclusion or a belief and its premises or grounds.\nThird, the ultimate premises or grounds relative to which a conclusion\nor belief is probable, as opposed to more immediate or proximate ones,\ncannot themselves be probable but must be certain (Lewis 1929,\n328\u20139, 340\u20131; Lewis 1946, 186\u20137; Lewis 1952a).\n\nThe direct apprehension of immediately given sense presentations, and\nstatements expressing them, are incorrigible, indubitable, not in need\nof verification, and not subject to error, and so, in these various\n(and distinct) senses, \u201ccertain\u201d. (For a useful discussion\nof senses of \u201ccertainty\u201d in Lewis, see Firth 1964 and\nFirth 1968 in Schilpp 1968.) However, with no possibility of error or\nincorrectness to contrast with the immediate awareness of the given,\nLewis decides the normative label \u201cknowledge\u201d\nshouldn\u2019t really be applied to it. Our objective interpretations\nof experience, on the other hand, are not only fallible\u2014given\nand recalled experience doesn\u2019t guarantee the satisfaction of\nour expectations about future experience--but are always subject to\nrevision in the light of action and further experience. Past\nexperience and our recollection of it play a key role in the\ncredibility of these interpretations. In MWO, Lewis (1929, 337) says\nthat memory itself is an interpretation of given present recollection,\nand, as such, probable knowledge with testable or verifiable\nimplications for future experience. However, this doesn\u2019t\nexplain what warrants the interpretation and its expectations, a\nlacuna AKV corrects. Knowing for Lewis occurs in a\nnon-instananeous \u201cepistemological present\u201d of sense\npresentation embedded in a mass of recollections or sense of past\nexperience (Lewis 1946, 331). What is given and indubitably certain in\nthis present are these sense presentations and these rememberings\n(Lewis 1946, 354, 362)), but what we recall of past experience is\nprima facie and non-inductively credible for us, just because\nso ostensibly remembered or recalled (Lewis 1946, 334), and thus can\nserve to make our expectations of future experience rationally\ncredible as well. \n\nDespite their lack of theoretical certainty, the beliefs we form by\napplying concepts to experience may count as knowledge so long as they\nare true and sufficiently warranted or justified. The members of a set\nof beliefs that already have some degree of confirmation or antecedent\nprobability in relation to present and past experience may become even\nmore credible if the antecedent probability of any one would be\nincreased by assuming the others as given (Lewis 1946, 187, 338, 349,\n351, 352). The congruence of a mature system of beliefs which exhibits\nthis complex interlocking pattern of probability relations to each\nother and to experience helps to explain how many of these beliefs can\nrise to the standards for knowledge and be practically certain enough\nto be counted on in action. \n\nOrdinary beliefs and interpretations, including perceptual beliefs,\nare, for Lewis, typically the product of habit or association in which\nwe are guided by the elements of the given in the epistemological\npresent but rarely if ever attend to them. Nonetheless, the\njustification of these beliefs as rationally credible requires that\nthere be an inferential or logical relationship of a belief or a\nstatement of it to grounds or reasons in experience that constitute\nevidence, largely inductive, for it (Lewis 1946, 315, Lewis 1952a,\nreprinted in Lewis 1970, 326). For Lewis, \u201cthe critical question\nfor the validity of empirical knowledge is not whether grounds\nsufficient for the justification of the belief are actually contained\nin the explicit psychological state of the believer, but whether the\nknower\u2019s situation in empirical belief is such that sufficient\ngrounds could be elicited upon inquiry, or whether it is such that\nthis is even theoretically impossible\u201d (Lewis 1946, 330).\nRestricting the term \u201cknowledge\u201d to cases where grounds\nare explicit would \u201cbe so rigoristic as to exclude most, if not\nall, of our attempted cognitions and would obscure the important\ndistinction of practically valuable knowledge from\n\u2018ignorance\u2019 and from \u2018error\u2019\u201d (Lewis\n1946, 330), just as restricting the term to what we are certain of\nwould. Nor should we think that the act of reflecting on and eliciting\nwhat in the epistemological present justifies our beliefs loses or\ntakes us beyond the epistemological present (Lewis 1946, 330\u20132),\nand thus is an impossible ideal. \n\nIn MWO Lewis argues that probable empirical knowledge requires, on\npain of infinite regress, some a priori knowledge of analytic\nprinciples explicating our concepts, the logical relationships among\nthem, and the criteria for applying them to experience and determining\nwhat is real and what isn\u2019t real. Moreover, this knowledge must\nbe \u201cmore than probable\u201d and \u201ccertain\u201d, which\nsuggests that they have a degree of warrant greater than the degree of\nprobability empirical considerations could yield (Lewis 1929,\n311\u201312, 317, 321). In AKV, he also says that mathematical and\nlogical cognitions \u201cmay be certain\u201d (Lewis, 1946, 29), at\nleast in certain cases, but he worries how they can refer to anything\nbeyond the cognition itself, and be classified as knowledge, if their\ntruth is simply the unthinkability of their falsity, given our\nconcepts or way of thinking. The answer is that we can be mistaken\nabout what is implicit in our concepts. We can fail to observe what is\nimplicit in our concepts and what their adoption consistently commits\nus to in our thinking, and that contrast with error allows him to\nclassify a priori apprehension as knowledge. Nonetheless, any\nof these mistakes is \u201cintrinsically possible of correction\nmerely by taking thought of the matter\u201d (Lewis 1946, 155)\nwithout empirical investigation. The correctness of the principles\ngoverning our concepts can be known a priori, independently\nof confirmation in experience, in so far as they can be certified or\nassured simply by analysis of meaning or reflection on the content of\nour concepts and our explicative principles (Lewis 1946, 151,165). So,\nquite apart from issues about certainty, the degree to which we are\nwarranted in our a priori apprehensions needn\u2019t\ncorrespond to and isn\u2019t a function of their probability on the\ntotal set of empirical considerations (cf. Lewis 1926, reprinted in\nLewis 1970, 243\u20134). \n\nWhat then is tested and confirmed or disconfirmed by experience is the\ninterpretation of experience in the light of our concepts, ordinary\nempirical concepts like dog as well as more abstract categories like\ncausality or the concepts of logic. What isn\u2019t tested by\nexperience is the validity of the concepts themselves, or the logical\nrelationships amongst them, or the principles for applying them.\nAgents bring them to experience and the only criteria they answer to\nare pragmatic ones of utility or convenience (Lewis 1929,\n271\u20132).That implies that they are also revisable on pragmatic\ngrounds, as Lewis himself recognizes he is doing to some extent with\nthe concept of knowledge itself (Lewis 1946, 27\u201329, 183) . \n\nRight at the heart of Lewis\u2019 philosophical system, then, are\nseveral theses that weren\u2019t original to Lewis, but the critical\ndiscussion (and sometimes rejection) of which, often in the form Lewis\ngave to them, was central to much analytic philosophy in the last half\nof the twentieth century. Among them are: (1) a sharp\nanalytic/synthetic, a priori/ a posteriori distinction, (2)\nreductionism concerning the meaning of a physical object statement to\nthe actual and possible sense experiences that would confirm the\nstatement, (3) a foundation for all empirical knowledge in our direct\napprehension or immediate awareness of the given character of\nexperience and our recollections of it, and (4) the division of\nexperience into its given content or character, on the one hand, and\nthe form we impose on it, or the concepts in the light of which we\ninterpret it, on the other. (Quine (1951 [1953]) famously called (1)\nand (2) the \u201ctwo dogmas of empiricism\u201d; Sellars (1963)\ncalled (3) the \u201cmyth of the given\u201d; and Davidson\n(1973\u20131974 [1984]) called (4) the \u201cthird dogma of\nempiricism\u201d, although in Lewis\u2019 mind (4) may owe more to\nKant\u2014on whom Lewis taught a course regularly at\nHarvard\u2014than to the empiricists.)\n\nAt the same time, Lewis (1946, 9\u201311, 254\u20139) also laid down\na framework of assumptions, most explicitly in AKV, within which\nanalytic epistemology flourished in the last half of the\n20th century: (1) knowledge is sufficiently justified\n(warranted, rationally credible) true belief , (2) a belief may be\njustified without being true and true without being justified, and (3)\nepistemology seeks to elicit criteria or principles of justification\nor rationally credibility. \n",
