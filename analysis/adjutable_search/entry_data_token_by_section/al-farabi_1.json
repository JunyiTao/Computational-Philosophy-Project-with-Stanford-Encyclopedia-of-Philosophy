    "main_text": "Language\n2. Language\n\nIn the Enumeration of the Sciences\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee first focuses on language, grammar,\nmetrics, etc. His Kit\u00e2b al-Hur\u00fbf (Book of Letters)\nor Particles, gives us much information on his views on\nlanguage. Muhsin Mahdi, who published the first edition of this text\nin 1969a based on a single manuscript, later on found two other manuscripts but could not complete a new edition. Making\nuse of the new material already gathered by Mahdi, Charles Butterworth\nhas prepared a second edition with facing full English\ntranslation to be published by Cornell University Press. Muhammad Ali Khalidi gave a partial English translation\ncovering the middle section (2005).  Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Anne Druart\n(2010) began studying al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s innovative\nviews of language. In Freiburg-im-Brisgau Nadja Germann (2015-16) and her team\nhave been working on language and logic in classical Arabic and are more and\nmore impressed by the sophistication of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s positions. As for\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, music is at the service of speech, the\nlast section of the Great Book of Music explains how\ntechnically to fit music to speech, i.e., poetry, in order to enhance\nthe meaning of a text. Azza Abd al-Hamid Madian\u2019s 1992 Ph. D.\ndissertation for Cornell University, Language-music relationships\nin al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s \u201cGrand Book of\nMusic\u201d, includes an English translation of this section.\n",
