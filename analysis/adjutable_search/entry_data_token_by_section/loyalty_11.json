    "main_text": "Limiting loyalty\n6. Limiting loyalty\n\nIt has already been noted that it is not part of loyalty to be\ncomplaisant or servile, though loyalty may be corrupted into such. In\nany plausible account of loyalty as a virtue there must be openness to\ncorrective criticism on the part of both the subject and object of\nloyalty. The \u201ccorrective\u201d qualification is important. Not\nany opposition is permissible. A loyal opponent is not just an\nopponent, but one who remains loyal. What that entails is that the\nopposition stays within bounds that are compatible with the well-being\nor best interests or flourishing of the object of loyalty. Generally\nspeaking, a loyal opposition will not advocate (the equivalent of)\nrebellion or revolution for the latter would jeopardize the object of\nloyalty (and perhaps lead to its replacement by an alternative object\nof loyalty).\n\nIt is the commitment to opposition within (what are judged to be) the\nprevailing structures that has led some radical critics of loyalty\n(e.g., Agassi, 1974; Greene, 1973) to see it as\u2014at\nbottom\u2014a conservative virtue. It is conservative,\nthough in a positive sense of that word: it involves a commitment to\nsecuring or preserving the interests of an associational object, an\nobject that is, or has come to be, valued for its own sake (whatever\nelse it may be valued for). Nevertheless, the existence of a loyal\nopposition need not preclude the possibility that a more radical\nopposition might and indeed should subsequently be mounted. If the\nloyal opposition proves incapable of \u201creforming\u201d the\nobject of loyalty, the exit option (or something stronger) might be\ntaken. In such cases it could be argued that the object of loyalty was\nno longer worthy of loyalty or had forfeited its claim to it. It is\nonly if we mistakenly or misguidedly think of loyalty as making an\nunconditional claim on us that a derogatory charge of conservatism\nagainst a loyal opposition will have traction (see Kleinig, 2019).\n\nFor heuristic purposes, we can probably distinguish loyalty to a\ntype of association (such as a state) or a particular\ninstantiation of the type (such as the United States). Strictly,\nloyalty will be only to the latter, though it assists in understanding\nthe limits of loyalty if we make the distinction. If the type of\ninstitution is thought to be critical to human flourishing, then\nloyalty to it will be expected. But if the institution is of\nrelatively minor significance, the development of instantiations of\nit, along with loyalty to them, will be relatively unimportant (though\nnot necessarily to those who develop such loyalties). Whether, for\nexample, patriotism (that is, patriotic loyalty) is justified will\ndepend in part on the importance to be accorded to a state or country.\nIf we are social contractarians, then the state (broadly conceived)\noffers a significant solution to some of the problems of human\nassociation as well as an arena for social identification. We might\nthink that both the state in general and loyalty to it are important.\nThe state in general, however, needs to be embodied in a particular\nstate, and that state may be such that the loyalty it should\ngarner is forfeited by how it acts.\n\nLoyalty to a particular object is forfeited\u2014that is, its claims\nfor the protection and reinforcement of associative identity and\ncommitment run out\u2014when the object shows itself to be no longer\nworthy or capable of being a source of associational satisfaction or\nidentity-giving significance. That is, the claims run out for the\nonce-loyal associate. (Others, of course, may dispute this.) But\nwhether or not loyalty is thought to be justifiably forfeited, the\nbreakpoint may differ for different people. Consider the case of\ninfidelity. For one woman, a husband\u2019s infidelity challenges the\nfuture of the relationship but does not automatically destroy it. The\nrelationship will be considered reparable. The issues of trust that\nare involved may be addressed and the relationship repaired. But for\nanother, such infidelity may collapse the structure in which the\nrelationship has been housed.\n\nIs there a right and a wrong in such cases? Does the first woman lack\nan appreciation of the \u201csanctity\u201d of marriage/intimacy?\nDoes the second fail to appreciate our shared frailty and the\npossibilities for redemption and renewal? We should probably not\nacquiesce in the relativistic view that what is right for one is wrong\nfor the other. At the same time, however, there may be no easy answer.\nThe two positions constitute the beginnings of a consideration of the\nnature of intimacy, what it reasonably demands of us, and how we\nshould respond to transgressions of its expectations.\n\nThe same may be true of other loyalties. Our approach may be assisted\nby utilizing the earlier heuristic distinction between the general\nform of an association and its particular instantiation. We may be\nable to reach some general consensus on what a state might reasonably\nexpect of us. However, in any actual association with a particular\nstate the content of the bond may be individualized.\n",
