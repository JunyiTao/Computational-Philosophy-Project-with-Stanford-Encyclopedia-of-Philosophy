But Kant also allows for judgments of beauty which are not\npure. Judgments of beauty can fail to be pure in two ways.\n\nThey can be influenced by the object\u2019s sensory or emotional\nappeal, that is, they can involve \u201ccharm\u201d [Reiz]\nor emotion [R\u00fchrung] (\u00a713).\nThey can be contingent on a certain concept\u2019s applying to\nthe object, so that the object is judged, not as beautiful tout\ncourt, but as beautiful qua belonging to this or that\nkind.\n\n\nThe second kind of impurity is discussed in \u00a716 in connection\nwith a distinction between \u201cfree\u201d [frei] beauty\nand \u201cadherent\u201d or \u201cdependent\u201d\n[anh\u00e4ngend] beauty.\n\nOne reason to think that the distinction is important is that Kant\nseems to suggest that all judgments of beauty about representational\nart are judgments of adherent rather than of free beauty, and hence\nthat they are all impure. (This is questioned by Tuna (2018), who\nholds that works of art which result from genius can be regarded as\ninstances of free rather than adherent beauty.) While some art works\ncan be \u201cfree beauties\u201d, the examples Kant gives are all of\nnon-representational art: \u201cdesigns a la grecque, foliage for\nborders or on wallpaper\u2026fantasias in music\u201d, and indeed,\nKant adds, all music without a text (\u00a716, 229). It might be\nsupposed from this that Kant\u2019s core account of judgments of\nbeauty is only peripherally applicable to art, which would make it\nlargely irrelevant to the concerns of contemporary aesthetics.\nHowever, this consequence is debatable. For example, Allison argues\nthat judgments of adherent beauty contain, as a component, a pure\njudgment of beauty. The purity of this core judgment is not undermined\nby its figuring in a more complex evaluation which takes into account\nthe object\u2019s falling under a concept (2001: 140\u2013141).\n\nKant\u2019s suggestion that representational art has\n\u201cadherent\u201d rather than \u201cfree\u201d beauty, and that\njudgments about such art fail to be pure, might also invite the\nobjection that Kant takes nonrepresentational art to be superior to\nrepresentational art, so that, say, wallpaper designs are\naesthetically more valuable than the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.\nThis objection is challenged by Schaper (1979: ch. 4, reprinted in\nGuyer 2003a) and by Guyer (2005b: chs. 4 and 5). Tuna (2018) adopts a\ndifferent approach to the underlying problem by arguing that works of\nart, if they are works of genius, should not be viewed as cases of\nadherent beauty in the first place.\n\nFurther discussions of the distinction between free and adherent\nbeauty include Scarre (1981), Lorand (1989), Gammon (1999), Guyer\n(2002a), Kalar (2006: 82\u201389), Zuckert (2007a: 202\u2013212),\nand Rueger (2008). Clewis (2018) provides useful historical context\nfor the distinction.\n",
