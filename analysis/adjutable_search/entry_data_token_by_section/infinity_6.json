Mathematics: number systems, Cantor\u2019s paradise, and beyond\n\nTo deal with some of the issues concerning the infinite raised in\nSection\n 2,\n mathematicians have developed various different structures that\nexplicitly include infinities. These structures ascribe different\nproperties to infinities that are appropriate for different\napplications. In some cases, there are multiple kinds of structure\nthat can be developed for an application. Explicitly countenancing\ninfinities has opened up an enormous range of choices and\npossibilities, which has been a wellspring of development in modern\nmathematics.\n\nWe now give a very quick tour of infinity in modern mathematics.\nSection\n 3.1\n reminds the reader of several familiar number systems: the natural\nnumbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers. Section\n 3.2\n discusses the infinite operations of limits and sums that underlie\ncalculus, and introduces the \u201cextended real numbers\u201d\n\\(+\\infty\\) and \\(-\\infty\\). The material in these two sections is\ncovered in most textbooks on real analysis, and even many calculus\ntextbooks, so some readers might already be familiar with it, while\nothers might benefit from having such a textbook on hand to expand on\nsome of the points.\n\nSections\n 3.3\n and\n 3.4\n are more mathematically advanced. Section\n 3.3\n introduces Cantor\u2019s more mathematically sophisticated\n\u201ccardinals and ordinals\u201d, which are probably the\nmathematical developments that have done the most to untangle many of\nthe conceptual confusions around infinity. This material is covered in\ngreater detail in most textbooks on set theory, and parts of it are\ndiscussed in many logic textbooks as well. It can be read largely\nindependently of the other sections.\n\nSection\n 3.4\n discusses a more recent mathematical theory of infinitely large and\ninfinitesimal numbers that provides an alternate setting for calculus.\nThis theory of \u201cnon-standard analysis\u201d has not become as\ncentral a part of the mathematics curriculum as real analysis and set\ntheory. It may thus be unfamiliar to most readers, and it is harder to\nfind accessible introductions elsewhere. Although non-standard\nanalysis is not as central a part of the cultural understanding of\ninfinity in mathematics as cardinals are, we include it both because\nit is a topic of growing interest in mathematics research, and because\nit can help make mathematically rigorous sense of both many intuitive\nthoughts about infinity and some of the early work on calculus in the\n17th and 18th centuries.\n\nUp to a point, various philosophical applications and puzzles\ninvolving infinity can be understood without much understanding of the\nmathematics of infinity. However, the mathematics helps us formulate\nand tackle them rigorously. Mathematics-shy readers could skip parts\nof our tour (particularly section\n 3.4)\n and still benefit from the later sections, but we encourage them to\nmake the effort and read on. The mathematical understanding of\ninfinity is a great achievement in its own right.\n",
