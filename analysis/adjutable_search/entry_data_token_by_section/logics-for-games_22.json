    "main_text": "The Nature of Players || Goals\n3.5 Goals\n\nGeneralizing the concept of winning or losing, agents can be assigned\ngoals they pursue in a game. Restricting to a single goal per agent\nretains a binary perspective: A goal is reached or not. Goals,\nhowever, allow for additional flexibility. Besides pure competition as\nin win-lose games, these can also express pure coordination games,\nwith everybody pursuing the same goal, or mixed motive games with\npartial overlap between different players\u2019 goals.\n\nThe concept of goal functions is particularly prominent in the logical\nframework of\n Boolean games\n (Harrenstein 2004). There, each agent\nis given control over some atomic propositions, permitting her to\nfreely decide on their truth value. Goals are then formulated as\npropositional formulas over the set of all players\u2019 atoms.\nCrucially, a player\u2019s goal formula might hence involve atoms\nthat are not under her control. In iterated extensive Boolean games,\ngoal formulas might also refer to properties of histories of play\ndefined in temporal logics (Gutierrez,\nHarrenstein, & Wooldridge 2015)\n\n",
