The Basic Idea\n1.1 Introduced\n\nThe term \u2018alienation\u2019 is usually thought to have comparatively modern\nEuropean origins. In English, the term had emerged by the early\nfifteenth century, already possessing an interesting cluster of\nassociations. \u2018Alienation\u2019, and its cognates, could\nvariously refer: to an individual\u2019s estrangement from God (it\nappears thus in the Wycliffe Bible); to legal transfers of ownership\nrights (initially, especially in land); and to mental derangement (a\nhistorical connection that survived into the nineteenth-century usage\nof the term \u2018alienist\u2019 for a psychiatric doctor). It is\nsometimes said that \u2018alienation\u2019 entered the German\nlanguage via English legal usage, although G.W.F. Hegel\n(1770\u20131831), for one, typically uses\n\u2018Ent\u00e4usserung\u2019, and not\n\u2018Entfremdung\u2019 to refer to property transfer\n(Hegel 1991a: \u00a765). (It is only the latter term which has an\netymological link to \u2018fremd\u2019 or\n\u2018alien\u2019.) Moreover, perhaps the first philosophical\ndiscussion of alienation, at least of any sophistication, was in\nFrench. In the Second Discourse, Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n(1712\u20131778) diagnoses \u2018inflamed\u2019 forms of amour\npropre\u2014a love of self (which is sometimes rendered as\n\u2018pride\u2019 or \u2018vanity\u2019 in older English\ntranslations)\u2014whose toxicity is amplified by certain social and\nhistorical developments, as manifesting themselves in alienated forms\nof self; that is, in the actions and lives of individuals who have\nsomehow become divided from their own nature (see Rousseau 1997, and\nForst 2017, 526\u201330).\n\nThere are limits to what can usefully be said about the concept of\nalienation in general; that is, what can usefully be said without\ngetting involved in the complexities of particular accounts, advanced\nby particular authors, or associated with particular intellectual\ntraditions. However, there is a basic idea here which seems to capture\nmany of those authors and traditions, and which is not unduly\nelusive or difficult to understand.\n\nThis basic idea of alienation picks out a range of social and\npsychological ills involving a self and other. More precisely, it\nunderstands alienation as consisting in the problematic separation of\na subject and object that belong together.\n1.2 Elaborated\n\nThat formulation of the basic idea is perhaps too abbreviated to be\neasily intelligible, and certainly benefits from a little elaboration.\nThe characterisation of alienation offered here\u2014as a social or\npsychological ill involving the problematic separation of a subject\nand object that belong together\u2014involves three constituent\nelements: a subject, an object, and the relation between them. It will\nbe helpful to say a little more about each of these in turn.\n\nFirst, the subject here is a self; typically, but not\nnecessarily, a person, an individual agent. \u2018Not\nnecessarily\u2019 because the subject could also be, for instance, a\ngroup of some kind. There seems to be no good reason to deny that a\ncollective as well as an individual agent might be alienated from some\nobject. For instance, as well as Anna being alienated from her\ngovernment, it might be that women or citizens find themselves\nalienated from their government.\n\nSecond, the relevant object can take a variety of forms.\nThese include: entities which are not a subject; another subject or\nsubjects; and oneself. The object here might be an entity which is not\na subject; for example, Beatrice might be alienated from the natural\nworld, from a social practice, from an institution, or from a social\nnorm, where none of those entities are understood as agents of any\nkind. In addition, the object might be an entity which is another\nsubject, another person or group; for example, Beatrice might be\nalienated from her childhood friend Cecile, and Beatrice might also be\nalienated from her own family. Lastly, the object here might be the\noriginal subject; that is, there might be reflexive variants of the\nrelation, for example, in which Beatrice is alienated from\nherself.\n\nThird, the relation is one of problematic separation between\na subject and object that belong together. All of these elements are required: there has to be a separation; the separation has to be problematic; and it has to obtain\nbetween a  subject and object that properly belong together.\n\nThe idea of separation is important. Not all problematic\nrelations between relevant entities involve alienation. For instance,\nbeing overly integrated into some other object might also be a\nproblematic or dysfunctional relation but it is not what is typically\nthought of as alienation. Imagine, for instance, that Cecile has no\nlife, no identity, finds no meaning, outside of her family membership.\nIt is tempting, at least for modern individuals, to say that she has\nan \u2018unhealthy\u2019 relationship with her family, but it would\nseem odd to say that she was alienated from it. Alienation typically\ninvolves a separation from something.\n\nThese problematic separations can be indicated by a wide\nvariety of words and phrases. No particular vocabulary seems to be\nrequired by the basic idea. The linguistic variety here might include\nwords suggesting: breaks (\u2018splits\u2019,\n\u2018ruptures\u2019, \u2018bifurcations\u2019,\n\u2018divisions\u2019, and so on); isolation\n(\u2018indifference\u2019, \u2018meaninglessness\u2019,\n\u2018powerlessness\u2019, \u2018disconnection\u2019, and so on);\nand hostility (\u2018conflicts\u2019, \u2018antagonism\u2019,\n\u2018domination\u2019, and so on). All these, and more, might be\nways of indicating problematic separations of the relevant kind. Of\ncourse, particular authors may use language more systematically, but\nthere seems little reason to insist that a specific vocabulary is\nrequired by the basic idea.\n\nThe idea of the relevant separation having to be, in some way,\nproblematic, is also important. Separations between a subject\nand object do not necessarily appear problematic. Relations of\nindifference, for example, might or might not be problematic. For an\nunproblematic instance, consider Daniela, a distinguished Spanish\narchitect, who\u2014when it is brought to her\nattention\u2014discovers that she is unconcerned with, and apathetic\ntowards, the complex constitutional relationship between the Pacific\nislands of Niue and New Zealand. Her indifference in this case looks\nunproblematic. Less obviously perhaps, the same might be true of\nrelations of hostility; that is, that hostility also might or might\nnot be problematic. For an unproblematic instance, consider Enid and\nFrancesca, two highly competitive middleweight boxers competing in the\nOlympics for the first time. It may well be that a certain amount of\nantagonism and rancour between these two individual sportswomen is\nentirely appropriate; after all, if Enid identifies too closely with\nFrancesca\u2014imagine her experiencing every blow to\nFrancesca\u2019s desires and interests as a defeat for her\nown\u2014she is not only unlikely to make it to the podium, but is\nalso, in some way, failing qua boxer.\n\nThe suggestion here is that to be appropriately\nproblematic\u2014appropriate, that is, to constitute examples of\nalienation\u2014the separations have to obtain between a subject and\nobject that properly belong together (Wood 2004: 3). More\nprecisely, that the candidate separations have to frustrate or\nconflict with the proper harmony or connectedness between that subject\nand object. Imagine, for instance, that both the indifference of\nDaniela, and the hostility of Enid, now also take appropriately\nproblematic forms. Perhaps we discover that Daniela has become\nincreasingly indifferent to her lifelong vocation, that she no longer\ncares about the design and construction issues over which she had\npreviously always enthused and obsessed; whilst Enid has started to develop feelings of loathing and suspicion for her domestic partner who she had previously trusted and loved. What makes these examples of separation (indifference and hostility) appear appropriately problematic is that they violate some\nbaseline condition of harmony or connectedness between the relevant\nentities. (A baseline condition that does not seem to obtain in the\nearlier examples of unproblematic separation.) Alienation\nobtains when a separation between a subject and object that properly\nbelong together, frustrates or conflicts with that baseline\nconnectedness or harmony. To say that they properly belong together is\nto suggest that the harmonious or connected relation between the\nsubject and object is rational, natural, or good. And, in turn, that\nthe separations frustrating or conflicting with that baseline\ncondition, are correspondingly irrational, unnatural, or bad. (For\nsome resistance to this characterisation, see Gilabert 2020,\n55\u201356.) Of course, that is not yet to identify what might establish\nthis baseline harmony as, say, rational, natural, or good. Nor is it\nto claim that the disruption of the baseline harmony is\nall-things-considered bad, that alienation could never be a justified\nor positive step. (These issues are discussed further in sections 4.1\nand 5.2, respectively.)\n1.3 Modesty Of\n\nThis basic idea of alienation appears to give us a diverse but\ndistinct set of social and psychological phenomena; picking out a\nclass of entities which might have little in common other than this\nproblematic separation of subject and object. The problematic\nseparations here are between the self (including individual and\ncollective agents) and other (including other selves, one\u2019s own\nself, and entities which are not subjects). So understood, the basic\nidea of alienation seems to play largely a diagnostic or critical\nrole; that is, the problematic separations might indicate that\nsomething is awry with the self or social world, but do not, in\nthemselves, offer an explanation of, or suggest a solution to, those\nills. \n\nOn this account, the basic idea of alienation looks conceptually\nrather modest. In particular, this idea is not necessarily committed\nto certain stronger claims that might sometimes be found in the\nliterature. That all these social and psychological ills are\ncharacterised by a problematic separation, for example, does not make\nalienation a natural kind, anymore than\u2014to borrow an example\nassociated with John Stuart Mill\u2014the class of white objects is a\nnatural kind (Wood 2004: 4). Nor, for instance, need there be any\nsuggestion that the various forms of alienation identified by this\naccount are necessarily related to each other; that, for example, they\nare all explained by the same underlying factor. Of course, particular\ntheorists may have constructed\u2014more or less\nplausible\u2014accounts of alienation that do advance those, or\nsimilar, stronger claims. For instance, the young Karl Marx\n(1818\u20131883) is often understood to have suggested that one of\nthe systematic forms of alienation somehow explains all the other ones\n(Wood 2004: 4). The claim here is simply that these, and other,\nstronger claims are not required by the basic idea.\n\nThat said, the basic idea of alienation appears to require only a few\nadditions in order to extend its critical reach significantly.\nConsider two further suggestions often made in this context: that\nalienation picks out an array of non-trivial social and psychological\nills that are prevalent in modern liberal societies; and that the idea\nof \u2018alienation\u2019 is distinct from that of\n\u2018injustice\u2019 on which much modern liberal political\nphilosophy is focused. These familiar claims are not extravagant, but,\nso understood, the concept of alienation would appear to have some\ncritical purchase on both contemporary liberal societies (for\ncontaining alienation) and contemporary liberal political philosophy\n(for neglecting alienation). The implied critical\nsuggestion\u2014that the concept of alienation reveals that something\nsignificant is awry with both liberal society and liberal\nunderstandings\u2014looks far from trivial. (Of course, establishing\nthat those purported failings reveal fundamental flaws in either\nliberal society, or liberal political philosophy, is rather harder to\naccomplish.)\n\nParticular theories of alienation typically restrict the range of\nproblematic separations that they are interested in, and introduce\nmore explanatory accounts of the extent and prognosis of alienation so\ncharacterised. They might, for instance, focus on social rather than\npsychological ills, and maintain that these are caused by certain\nstructural features\u2014particular aspects of its economic\narrangements, for instance\u2014of the relevant society. Such\nexplanatory claims are of considerable interest. After all,\nunderstanding the cause of a problem looks like a helpful step towards\nworking out whether, and how, it might be alleviated or overcome.\nHowever, these explanatory claims are not readily open to general\ndiscussion, given the significant disagreements between particular\nthinkers and traditions that exist in this context. Note also that\nintroducing these various restrictions of scope, and various competing\nexplanatory claims, increases the complexity of the relevant account.\nHowever, these complexities alone scarcely explain the\u2014somewhat\nundeserved\u2014reputation that the concept of alienation has for\nbeing unduly difficult or elusive. It might be that their impact is\ncompounded\u2014at least in the intellectual traditions with which\nthe concept of alienation is most often associated (Hegelianism and\nMarxism)\u2014by language and argumentative structures that are\nunfamiliar to some modern readers.\n2. Adjacent Concepts\n2.1 Introduced\n\nIt may be helpful to say something about the relation of alienation to\nwhat can be called \u2018adjacent\u2019 concepts. The two examples\ndiscussed here are both drawn from Hegelian and Marxist traditions;\nnamely, the concepts of fetishism and objectification. Disambiguating\nthe relationship between these various concepts can help clarify the\ngeneral shape of alienation. However, they are also discussed because\nparticular accounts of alienation, both within and beyond those two\ntraditions, are sometimes said\u2014more or less plausibly\u2014to\nconflate alienation either with fetishism, or with objectification. Even if some particular treatments of alienation\ndo equate the relevant concepts with each other, alienation is better\nunderstood as synonymous with neither fetishism nor\nobjectification. Rather, fetishism is only one form that alienation can take, and not all objectification involves alienation.\n2.2 Fetishism\n\nThe first of these adjacent ideas is fetishism.\n\u2018Fetishism\u2019 refers here to the idea of human creations\nwhich have somehow escaped (we might say that they have\ninappropriately separated out from) human control, achieved the\nappearance of independence, and come to enslave or dominate their\ncreators.\n\nWithin Hegelian and Marxist traditions, a surprisingly wide range of\nsocial phenomena\u2014including religion, the state, and private\nproperty\u2014have been characterised as having the character of a\nfetish. Indeed, Marx sometimes treats the phenomenon of fetishism as a\ndistinguishing feature of modernity; where previous historical epochs\nwere characterised by the rule of persons over persons, capitalist\nsociety is characterised by the rule of things over persons.\n\u2018Capital\u2019, we might say, has come to replace the feudal\nlord. Consider, for instance, the frequency with which \u2018market\nforces\u2019 are understood and represented within modern culture as\nsomething outside of human control, as akin to natural forces which\ndecide our fate. In a famous image\u2014from the Communist\nManifesto\u2014Marx portrays modern bourgeois society as\n\u2018like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers\nof the nether world whom he has called up by his spells\u2019 (Marx\nand Engels 1976: 489).\n\nIn order to elaborate this idea of fetishism, consider the example of\nChristian religious consciousness, as broadly understood in the\nwritings of Ludwig Feuerbach (1804\u20131872). (Feuerbach was a\ncontemporary of, and important influence on, the young Marx, amongst\nothers.) The famous, and disarmingly simple, conclusion of\nFeuerbach\u2019s philosophical analysis of religious consciousness is\nthat, in Christianity, individuals are worshipping the predicates of\nhuman nature, freed of their individual limitations and projected onto\nan ideal entity. For Feuerbach, however, this is no purely\nintellectual error, but is rather ripe with social, political, and\npsychological consequences, as this \u2018deity\u2019 now comes to\nenslave and dominate us. Not least, the Christian God demands real\nworld sacrifices from individuals, typically in the form of a denial\nor repression of their essential human needs. For instance, the\nChristian idea of marriage is portrayed as operating in a way that\nrepresses and punishes, rather than hallows and satisfies, the flesh\nof humankind (Leopold 2007: 207\u2013210).\n\nReligious consciousness, on this Feuerbachian account, looks to be a\ncase where alienation takes the form of fetishism. That is, there is\nboth a problematic separation here between subject and object\n(individuals and their own human nature), and it takes the form of a\nhuman creation (the idea of the species embodied in God) escaping our\ncontrol, achieving the appearance of independence, and coming to\nenslave and dominate us. The same looks to be true, on\nMarx\u2019s account, of production in contemporary capitalist\nsocieties. Capital takes on the appearance of an independent social\npower which determines what is produced, how it is produced, and the\neconomic (and other) relations between producers. Marx himself was\nstruck by the parallel, and in the first volume of Capital,\noffers the following analogy: \u2018As, in religion, man is governed\nby the products of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is\ngoverned by the products of his own hand\u2019 (Marx 1996: 616).\nHowever, rather than equating alienation and fetishism, fetishism is\nbetter thought of as a particular form that alienation might take. (To\nbe clear, there looks to be no reason to think that Marx would, or\nshould, disagree with this claim.)\n\nNote, in particular, that although Marx\u2019s discussions of\nalienation often utilise the language of fetishism, not all of them\ntake that form. Consider, for instance, the problematic separation\nsometimes said to exist between modern individuals and the natural\nworld, as the former think of themselves and behave as if they were\nisolated, or cut off, or estranged, from the latter. The idea here is\nreflected in the less \u2018Promethean\u2019 moments of Marx\u2019s\nwork, for example, in the suggestion that the appropriate relation\nbetween humankind and nature would involve not our instrumental\ndomination of \u2018the other\u2019, but rather a sympathetic\nappreciation of our complex interdependence with the natural world of\nwhich we are, in reality, a part. Those moments are perhaps most\nevident in Marx\u2019s discussion of contemporary\n\u2018ecological\u2019 threats\u2014including deforestation,\npollution, and population growth\u2014and typically involve his\n\u2018metabolic\u2019 account of the appropriate relation between\nhumankind and nature (Foster 1999). The inappropriate modern relation\nbetween humankind and nature here looks like an example of\nalienation\u2014there is a problematic separation of self and\nother\u2014but certain central characteristics of fetishism would\nappear to be absent. Most obviously, the natural world is not a human\ncreation which has escaped our control; not least, because\nnature is not a human creation. Moreover, the impact on humankind\nof this particular separation does not comfortably suit the language\nof enslavement and domination. Indeed, if anything, our inappropriate\nseparation from the natural world seems to find expression in our own\nruthlessly instrumental treatment of nature, rather than in\nnature\u2019s tyranny over us.\n2.3 Objectification\n\nThe second of these adjacent ideas is objectification. The\nconcept in question is not the idea of objectification\u2014familiar\nfrom certain feminist and Kantian traditions\u2014which concerns the\nmoral impropriety of systematically treating a human being as if she\nwere an object, thing, or commodity (Nussbaum 1995). That is a\ndistinct and important phenomenon, but it is not the one that is\nrelevant here. In the present context, objectification refers rather\nto the role of productive activity in mediating the evolving\nrelationship between humankind and the natural world. This association\nis most familiar from certain Hegelian and Marxist traditions, with\nMarx often using the German term\n\u2018Vergegenst\u00e4ndlichung\u2019 to capture what is\nhere called \u2018objectification\u2019 (e.g., 1975: 272).\n\nHumankind is seen as being part of, and dependent upon, the natural\nworld. However, nature is initially somewhat stingy with its\nblessings; as a result, human beings confront the natural world from\nan original position of scarcity, struggling through productive\nactivity of various kinds to change the material form of\nnature\u2014typically through making things\u2014in ways that make\nit better reflect and satisfy their own needs and interests. In that\nevolving process, both the natural world and humankind come to be\ntransformed. Through this collective shaping of their material\nsurroundings, and their increasing productivity, the natural world is\nmade to be, and seem, less \u2018other\u2019, and human beings\nthereby come to objectify themselves, to express their essential\npowers in concrete form. These world transforming productive\nactivities, we might say, embody the progressive self-realisation of\nhumankind.\n\nOn this account, all productive activity would seem to involve\nobjectification. However, Marx insists that not all productive\nactivity involves alienation. Moreover, some other forms of\nalienation\u2014unrelated to productive activity\u2014have no\nobvious connection with objectification.\n\nMarx maintains that productive activity might or might not take an\nalienated form. For instance, productive activity in capitalist\nsocieties is typically said to take an alienated form; whereas\nproductive activity in communist societies is typically predicted to\ntake an unalienated or meaningful form. Schematically, we might\nportray alienated labour (characteristic of capitalist\nsociety) as: being forced; not involving self-realisation (not\ndeveloping and deploying essential human powers); not intended to\nsatisfy the needs of others; and not appropriately appreciated by\nthose others. And, schematically, we might portray unalienated or\nmeaningful work (characteristic of communist society) as:\nbeing freely chosen; involving self-realisation (the development and\ndeployment of essential human powers); being intended to satisfy the\nneeds of others; and being appropriately appreciated by those\nothers (Kandiyali 2020). Productive activity mediates the\nrelationship between humankind and the natural world in both of these\nsocieties, but alienation is found only in the former (capitalist)\ncase.\n\nFor an example of a view which might be said to equate objectification\nwith alienation, consider what is sometimes called the\n\u2018Christian\u2019 view of work. On this account, work is seen as\na necessary evil, an unpleasant activity unfortunately required for\nour survival. It owes its name to Christianity\u2019s embrace of the\nclaim that alienated work is part of the human condition: at least\nsince the Fall, human beings are required to work by the sweat of\ntheir brows (see Genesis 31:9). On Marx\u2019s account, or something\nlike it, one might characterise this Christian view as mistakenly\nequating objectification and alienation, confusing productive activity\nas such with its stunted and inhuman forms. Indeed, one might go\nfurther and suggest that this kind of confusion reflects the alienated\nsocial condition of humankind, embodying an emblematic failure to\nunderstand that material production is a central realm in which human\nbeings can express, in free and creative ways, the kind of creatures\nthat they are.\n\nIn addition, according to the basic idea defended here, equating\nalienation and objectification fails to appreciate that certain forms\nof alienation might have nothing at all to do with productive\nactivity. Their mutual hostility and undisguised contempt confirm that\nGillian and her sister Hanna are alienated from each other, but there\nseems little reason to assume that their estrangement is necessarily\nrelated to the world of work or their respective place in it. The\nsisters\u2019 engagement in productive activity and the forms that it\ntakes, might well have nothing to do with the problematic separation\nhere. Imagine that the latter arose from a combination of sibling\nrivalry, stubbornness, and a chance misunderstanding at a time of\nfamily crisis involving the death of a parent. This possibility gives\nus another reason not to equate alienation and objectification.\n\nIn short, neither fetishism, nor objectification, are best construed as identical with alienation. Rather than being synonymous, these concepts only partially overlap. Fetishism can be understood as picking out only a subset\u2014on some accounts perhaps\na large subset\u2014of cases of alienation. And there are forms of\nobjectification which do not involve alienation (the meaningful work\nin communist societies, for instance), as well as forms of\nalienation\u2014outside of productive activity\u2014with no obvious\nconnection to objectification.\n3. Subjective and Objective Alienation\n3.1 The Distinction Between Subject and Objective Alienation\n\nThe basic idea of alienation may not be unduly elusive or\ndifficult to understand. However, it obviously does not follow\nthat there are no complexities or slippery issues here, perhaps\nespecially once we venture further into the relevant literature.\n\nThree interesting complexities are introduced here. They concern,\nrespectively: the distinction between subjective and objective\nalienation; the need for a criterion identifying candidate separations\nas problematic; and the relation between alienation and\nvalue.\n\nThis section provides an introduction to, and some initial reflections\non, the first of these interesting complexities; namely, the division\nof alienation into subjective and objective varieties (Hardimon 1994:\n119\u2013122). Not all theorists or traditions operate (either,\nexplicitly or implicitly) with this distinction, but it can be a\nconsiderable help in understanding the diagnosis offered by particular\nauthors and in handling particular cases.\n\nFirst, alienation is sometimes characterised in terms of how subjects\nfeel, or think about, or otherwise experience, the problematic\nseparation here. This can be called subjective alienation.\nFor instance, Ingrid might be said to be alienated because she feels\nestranged from the world, because she experiences her life as lacking\nmeaning, because she does not feel \u2018at home [zu\nHause]\u2019 in the world\u2014to adopt the evocative shorthand\nsometimes used by Hegel\u2014and so on (e.g. 1991a: \u00a74A,\n\u00a7187A, and \u00a7258A).\n\nSecond, alienation is sometimes characterised in terms which make no\nreference to the feelings, thoughts, or experience of subjects. This\ncan be called objective alienation. For instance, Julieta\nmight be said to be alienated because some separation prevents her\nfrom developing and deploying her essential human characteristics,\nprevents her from engaging in self-realising activities, and so on.\nSuch claims are controversial in a variety of ways, but they assume\nalienation is about the frustration of that potential, and they make\nno reference to whether Julieta herself experiences that lack as a\nloss. Maybe Julieta genuinely enjoys her self-realisation-lacking\nlife, and even consciously rejects the goal of self-realisation as\ninvolving an overly demanding and unattractive ideal.\n\nSubjective alienation is sometimes disparaged \u2013 treated, for example,\nas concerning \u2018merely\u2019 how an individual\n\u2018feels\u2019 about \u2018real\u2019 alienation. However, subjective alienation is better understood as a full-blown, meaningful, variety of alienation, albeit\nnot the only one. If you genuinely feel alienated, then you really are\n(subjectively) alienated.\n3.2 Diagnostic Schema\n\nThis distinction between subjective and objective alienation can give\nus a useful diagnostic schema. Let us assume\u2014no doubt\ncontroversially\u2014that all combinations of these two forms of\nalienation are possible. That gives us four social outcomes to\ndiscuss:\n\n\n\n\nSocial\n\nSituation:\nSubjective\n\nAlienation:\nObjective\n\nAlienation: \n\n(i)\n\u25fc\n\u25fc \n\n(ii)\n\u25fb\n\u25fc \n\n(iii)\n\u25fc\n\u25fb \n\n(iv)\n\u25fb\n\u25fb  \n\n\nWhere: \u25fb = Absent and \u25fc = Present\n\n3.3 Applications\n\nThese various alternative combinations\u2014numbered (i) to (iv)\nabove\u2014correspond, very roughly, to the ways in which particular\nauthors have characterised particular kinds of social arrangement or\ntypes of society. Consider, for example, the different views of modern\nclass-divided society taken by Hegel and Marx.\n\nMarx can be characterised as diagnosing contemporary capitalist\nsociety as corresponding to situation (i); that is, as being a social\nworld which contains both objective and subjective alienation. On what\nwe might call his standard view, Marx allows that objective and\nsubjective alienation are conceptually distinct, but assumes that in\ncapitalist societies they are typically found together sociologically\n(perhaps with the subjective forms tending to track the objective\nones). However, there are passages where he deviates from that\nstandard view, and\u2014without abandoning the thought that objective\nalienation is, in some sense, more fundamental\u2014appears to allow\nthat, on occasion, subjective and objective alienation can also come\napart sociologically. At least, that is one way of reading a\nwell-known passage in The Holy Family which suggests that\ncapitalists might be objectively but not subjectively alienated. In\nthese remarks, Marx recognises that capitalists do not get to engage\nin self-realising activities of the right kind (hence their objective\nalienation), but observes that\u2014unlike the proletariat\u2014the\ncapitalists are content in their estrangement; not least,\nthey feel \u2018at ease\u2019 in it, and they feel\n\u2018strengthened\u2019 by it (Marx and Engels 1975: 36).\n\nIn contrast, Hegel maintains that the modern social world approximates\nto something more like situation (iii); that is, as being a social\nworld not containing objective alienation, but still containing\nsubjective alienation. That is, for Hegel, the social and political\nstructures of the modern social world do constitute a home, because\nthey enable individuals to realise themselves, variously as family\nmembers, economic agents, and citizens. However, those same\nindividuals fail to understand or appreciate that this is the case,\nand rather feel estranged from, and perhaps even consciously reject,\nthe institutions of the modern social world. The resulting situation\nhas been characterised as one of \u2018pure subjective\nalienation\u2019 (Hardimon 1994: 121).\n\nThat Hegel and Marx diagnose modern society in these different ways\nhelps to explain their differing strategic political commitments. They\nboth aim to bring society closer to situation (iv)\u2014that is, a\nsocial world lacking systematic forms of both objective and subjective\nalienation\u2014but, since they disagree about where we are starting\nfrom, they propose different routes to that shared goal. For Marx,\nsince we start from situation (i), this requires that the existing\nworld be overturned; that is, that both institutions and attitudes\nneed to be revolutionised (overcoming objective and subjective\nalienation). For Hegel, since we start from situation (iii), this\nrequires only attitudinal change: we come to recognise that the\nexisting world is already objectively \u2018a home\u2019, and in\nthis way \u2018reconcile\u2019 ourselves to that world, overcoming\npure subjective alienation in the process.\n\nSituation (ii) consists of a social world containing objective, but\nnot subjective, alienation \u2013 a situation that can be characterised as\none of \u2018pure objective alienation\u2019 (Hardimon\n1994: 120). It is perhaps not too much of a stretch to think of\nthis situation as corresponding, very roughly, to one of the Frankfurt\nSchool\u2019s more nightmarish visions of contemporary capitalist\nsociety. (The Frankfurt School is the colloquial label given to\nseveral generations of philosophers and social theorists, in the\nWestern Marxist tradition, associated\u2014more or less\nclosely\u2014with the Institute for Social Research founded in\n1929\u20131930.) For example, in the pessimistic diagnosis of Herbert\nMarcuse (1898\u20131979), articulated in One-Dimensional Man\n(1964), individuals in advanced capitalist societies appear happy in\ntheir dysfunctional relationships\u2014they \u2018identify\nthemselves\u2019 with their estranged circumstances and gain\n\u2018satisfaction\u2019 from them (2002: 13). Objective alienation\nstill obtains, but no longer generates social conflict, since the\nlatter is assumed\u2014not implausibly\u2014to require agents who\nfeel, or experience, some form of hostility or rebelliousness towards\nexisting social arrangements.\n\nThat latter assumption raises the wider issue of the relation between\nalienation and, what might be called \u2018revolutionary\nmotivation\u2019. Let us assume that radical social change requires,\namongst other conditions, an agent\u2014typically a collective\nagent\u2014with both the strength and the desire to bring that change\nabout. The role of alienation in helping to form that latter\npsychological prerequisite\u2014the desire to bring about change on\nthe part of the putative revolutionary agent\u2014looks complicated.\nFirst, it would seem that the mere fact of objective alienation cannot play\nthe motivating role, since it does not involve or require any feeling,\nor thinking about, or otherwise experiencing, the problematic\nseparation here. It remains possible, of course, that a subject\u2019s knowledge of that alienation\nmight\u2014depending, not least, on one\u2019s views on the\nconnections between reasons and motivations\u2014provide an\nappropriately psychological incentive to revolt. Second, the relation\nbetween subjective alienation and motivation looks more complex than\nit might initially seem. Note, in particular, that some of the\nexperiential dimensions of subjective alienation look less likely than\nothers to generate the psychological prerequisites of action here.\nFeelings of powerlessness and isolation, for instance, might well\ngenerate social withdrawal and individual atomism, rather than radical\nsocial engagement and cooperative endeavour, on the part of the\nrelevant agents. In short, whether subjective alienation is a friend\nor an enemy of revolutionary motivation would seem to depend on the\nprecise form that it takes.\n\nInterestingly, situation (ii)\u2014that is, the case of \u2018pure\nobjective alienation\u2019\u2014might also be thought to approximate\nto the social goal of certain thinkers in the tradition of\nexistentialism (the tradition of Jean-Paul Sartre (1905\u20131980),\nAlbert Camus (1913\u20131960), and others). Some interpretative\ngenerosity may be needed here, but existentialists appear to think of (something like) objective alienation as a permanent feature of all human societies. Rejecting both substantive accounts of essential human nature, and the ethical embrace of social relations\nthat facilitate the development and deployment of those human\ncharacteristics, they rather maintain that the social world will\nalways remain \u2018other\u2019, can never be a \u2018home\u2019.\nHowever, although this \u2018otherness\u2019 can never be overcome,\nthere do look to be better and worse ways of dealing with it. What is\nessential to each individual is what they make of themselves, the ways\nin which they choose to engage with that other. The preferred outcome\nhere seems to involve individuals embodying a norm of\n\u2018authenticity\u2019, which amongst other conditions\u2014such\nas choosing, or committing, to their own projects\u2014may require\nthat they have the \u2018courage\u2019 to \u2018grasp, accept, and,\nperhaps even affirm\u2019 the fact that the social world is not a\nhome for them (Hardimon 1994: 121).\n\nThis also clarifies that situation (iv)\u2014which contains\nsystematic forms of neither objective or subjective\nalienation\u2014is the social goal of some but not all of these\nauthors (of Hegel and Marx, for instance, but not the\nexistentialists). Of course, (iv) might also be a characterisation of\nthe extant social world according to a hypothetical, and\nover-optimistic, apologist for the present.\n4. What Makes a Separation Problematic?\n4.1 Criteria of \u2018Impropriety\u2019\n\nThe second of the interesting complexities broached here concerns what\nwe can call the need for a criterion of\n\u2018impropriety\u2019 \u2013 that is, a criterion by which candidate\nseparations might be identified as problematic or not. Recall the\nearlier suggestion that accounts of alienation require some benchmark\ncondition of harmony or connectedness against which separations might\nbe assessed as problematic or not.\n\nHistorically, this role\u2014identifying whether candidate\nseparations are problematic\u2014has often been played by accounts of\nour essential human nature. However, motivated by suspicion of that\nlatter idea, theorists of alienation have sometimes sought\nalternatives to fulfil that role.\n4.2 Essential Human Nature\n\nTo see how the appeal to human nature works, imagine two hypothetical\ntheorists\u2014Katerina and Laura\u2014seeking to assess whether\nalienation exists in a particular society. We can stipulate that the\ninstitutions and culture of this particular society are\nindividualistic\u2014in the sense that they systematically frustrate\ncooperation and sociability\u2014and that the two theorists share\nmany, but not all, of the same views. In particular, assume that our\ntwo theorists agree that: alienation is a coherent and useful\nconcept; the account of alienation given here is, broadly\nspeaking, plausible; the only serious candidate for a problematic\nseparation in this particular society are those arising from its\nindividualism; and our essential human nature provides the\nbenchmark of \u2018propriety\u2019 for assessing separations. Simply\nput, separations are problematic if they frustrate, and unproblematic\nif they facilitate, \u2018self-realisation\u2019. Self-realisation\nis understood here as a central part of the good life and as\nconsisting in the development and deployment of an individual\u2019s\nessential human characteristics. However, assume also that Katerina\nand Laura disagree about what comprises human nature. In\nparticular, they disagree about whether cooperation and sociability\nare essential human characteristics, with Katerina insisting that they\nare and Laura insisting that they are not. It seems to follow that\nKaterina will conclude, and Laura will deny, that this society is one\ncontaining alienation. For Katerina, the widespread lack of\ncooperation and sociability confirm that the basic social institutions\nhere frustrate our self-realisation. For Laura, the very same\nwidespread lack of cooperation and sociability confirm that the basic\nsocial institutions facilitate, or at least do not\nfrustrate, our self-realisation.\n\nNote that in sub-section 1.2, where the basic idea of alienation was\nelaborated, various relations between subject and object were\ndistinguished, only one of which was characterised as reflexive.\nHowever, in the light of the present discussion, we might now think it\nmore accurate to say that\u2014on this kind of account, which\nuses our essential human nature to identify alienation\u2014only\none of them was directly reflexive, because there is some\nsense in which all of those dimensions of alienation involve a\nseparation from some aspect of our own human nature. After all, this\nis precisely what picks out the relevant separation as problematic.\nFor example, the separation of individuals from each other is, for\nKaterina, indirectly also a separation from human nature, from the\ncooperation and sociability that characterises our essential\nhumanity.\n4.3 An Alternative Criterion\n\nAs already noted, this benchmark\u2014by which candidate separations\nare assessed as problematic or not\u2014is often, but not always,\nplayed by accounts of our essential human nature. Given the widespread\ncontemporary suspicion of such accounts\u2014not least, by those\nopposed to what is sometimes called \u2018essentialism\u2019 about\nhuman nature\u2014it might be helpful to sketch a recent account\nof alienation which is not dependent on such assumptions (or, at\nleast, consciously strives to avoid them). There is also a potential\nbenefit here for those of us who do not fully share that suspicion,\nnamely, that such an example might provide some sense of the\ndiversity of available theories of alienation.\n\nRahel Jaeggi offers an account of alienation of this kind, and\nsituates it explicitly in the tradition of Critical Theory \u2013 the kind\nof emancipatory theory associated with the Frankfurt School. On this\naccount, the idea of alienation has the potential to help us\nunderstand and change the world, but only if it receives some\nsignificant conceptual reconstruction. Alienation is still associated\nwith the frustration of freedom, with disruptions to something like\n\u2018self-realisation\u2019. However, this account\u2014unlike its\nforerunners and associates\u2014is said not to be fatally compromised\nby a commitment to either \u2018strongly objectivistic\u2019\ntheories of the good life or \u2018essentialist\u2019 conceptions of\nthe self (Jaeggi 2014: 40).\n\nThe crucial term of art here is \u2018appropriation\u2019, which\nJaeggi uses to refer to the capacity for, and process of, relating to\nour own actions and projects in ways which engage \u2018something\nlike self-determination and being the author of one\u2019s own\nlife\u2019  (2014: 39). Appropriation is successful\u2014and\nalienation is absent\u2014when \u2018one is present in one\u2019s\nactions, steers one\u2019s life instead of being driven by it,\nindependently appropriates social roles and is able to identify with\none\u2019s desires, and is involved in the world\u2019 (Jaeggi 2014:\n155). In contrast, appropriation is unsuccessful\u2014and alienation\nis present\u2014when there is \u2018an inadequate power and a lack\nof presence in what one does, a failure to identify with one\u2019s\nown actions and desires and to take part in one\u2019s own\nlife\u2019 (Jaeggi 2014: 155). Alienation is thus identified with\nsystematic disruptions of the process of appropriation \u2013 in particular,\nin those systematic disruptions which lead us to fail to experience\nour actions and projects as our own. These disruptions are said\ntypically to take one of four forms: first,\n\u2018powerlessness\u2019 or the experience of losing control over\none\u2019s own life; second, \u2018loss of authenticity\u2019\nespecially when one is unable to identify with one\u2019s own social\nroles; third, \u2018internal division\u2019 where one experiences\nsome of one\u2019s own desires and impulses as alien; and fourth,\n\u2018indifference\u2019 or a detachment from one\u2019s own\nprevious projects and self-understandings.\n\nThis model fits happily enough with our basic idea of alienation as\nconsisting in a  problematic separation between self and other\nthat belong together. However, the conditions for identifying\nthe relevant dysfunctional relation here are intended to be less\ndemanding and controversial than those involving claims about our\nessential human nature. There is a kindred notion of freedom as\nself-realisation, but it is said to be the realisation of a thin kind\nof self-determining agency and not the actualisation of some thick\n\u2018pre-given\u2019 identity of an essentialist sort. A normative\ndimension remains, but it is presented as expansive and broadly\nprocedural. It is expansive in that a wide range of actions and\nprojects might be included within its remit. And it is procedural in\nthat the benchmark for judging the success of these various actions\nand projects is that they were brought about in the right kind of\nself-determination delivering way, and not that their content reflects\na narrow and controversial account of what human beings are \u2018in\nessence\u2019.\n\nModern culture is said to recognise and value the kind of freedom at\nthe heart of this picture of appropriation. As a result, this account\nof alienation can be presented as a form of immanent\ncritique \u2013 that is, as utilising a standpoint which judges\nindividuals and forms of life according to standards that those\nindividuals have themselves propounded or which those forms of life\npresuppose. At the individual level, this critique might involve\nidentifying potential tensions between the conditions for treating\npeople as responsible agents, and the obstructions to such agency that\ncharacterise alienated selves \u2013 for instance, the feelings of\npowerlessness that prevent individuals from directing and embracing\ntheir own lives. And at the social level, this critique might involve\nidentifying potential discrepancies between modern ideals of freedom\nand their actual realisation in the contemporary world \u2013 for instance,\nthe existence of social or political roles that an individual can\nnever make their own (Jaeggi 2014: 41\u201342).\n\nOf course, there remain questions about this account, and three are\nbroached here. First, one might doubt whether the contrast between\nessentialist accounts of human nature, on the one hand, and a thinner\nkind of self-governing agency, on the other, can either be sustained\nor play the role intended. Second, one might wonder about the\nground(s) of normativity; after all, that the kind of subjectivity or\nself-determination which appropriation embodies is recognised and\nvalued in modern culture does not in itself establish its ethical\nworth. (More generally, it can seem easier to dismiss Hegelian\nteleology, or Marxist perfectionism, than it is to find wholly\nsatisfactory replacements for them.) Third, one might be sceptical\nabout the degree of social criticism here, since both the sources of,\nand solutions to, Jaeggi\u2019s paradigmatic examples of\nunsuccessful appropriation (\u2018powerless\u2019, \u2018loss\nof authenticity\u2019, \u2018internal division\u2019,\nand \u2018indifference\u2019) seem to focus on the\n\u2018thoughts and dispositions\u2019 of individuals rather than the\nstructures of particular societies (Haverkamp 2016, 69). Of course,\nthere might be plausible responses to these critical worries, some\nof which could draw on Jaeggi\u2019s own subsequent work\n(see espcially 2018). \n5. Alienation and Value\n5.1 Negative Element\n\nThe third of these interesting complexities concerns the ethical\ndimension of alienation. The connections between alienation and ethics\nare many and diverse, and there is no attempt here to sketch that\nwider landscape in its entirety. Instead, attention is drawn to two\ntopographical features: the claim that alienation is necessarily a\nnegative, but not a wholly negative, phenomenon, is elaborated and\ndefended; and the suggestion that some forms of moral theory or even\nmorality itself might encourage or embody alienation is briefly\noutlined.\n\nThe claim that alienation is necessarily a negative, but not a wholly\nnegative, phenomenon can be addressed in two parts. Defending the\nfirst part of that claim looks straightforward enough. Alienation, on\nthe present account, consists in the separation of certain entities\n\u2013 a subject and some object\u2014that properly belong together.\nAs a result, alienation always involves a loss or lack of something of\nvalue, namely, the \u2018proper\u2019\u2014rational, natural, or\ngood\u2014harmony or connectedness between the relevant subject and\nobject. \n5.2 Positive Element\n\nIt is the second part of the claim which looks less obvious: that\nalienation is not a wholly negative phenomena, that is, that the loss\nor lack here may not always be the whole story, ethically speaking.\nNote, in particular, that some well-known accounts also locate an\nachievement of something of value in the moment of alienation. The resulting ethical\n\u2018gains\u2019 and \u2018losses\u2019 would then need to be weighed and\njudged overall.\n\nIn order to illustrate this possibility\u2014that alienation can\ninvolve the achievement of something of value\u2014consider the\nnuanced and critical celebration of capitalism found, but not always\nrecognised, in Marx\u2019s writings. One pertinent way of introducing\nthis account involves locating the moment of alienation within a\npattern of development that we might call \u2018dialectical\u2019 in\none sense of that slippery term.\n\nThe dialectical pattern here concerns the developing relationship\nbetween a particular subject and object: the individual, on the one\nhand, and their social role and community, on the other. By a\ndialectical progression is meant only a movement from a stage\ncharacterised by a relationship of \u2018undifferentiated\nunity\u2019, through a stage characterised by a relationship of\n\u2018differentiated disunity\u2019, to a stage characterised by a\nrelationship of \u2018differentiated unity\u2019.\nThere are no further claims made here about the necessity, the naturalness, or the\nprevalence, of such progressions (Cohen 1974: 237).\n\nThe dialectical progression here involves three historical\nstages:\n\nFirst, past (pre-capitalist) societies are said to\nembody undifferentiated unity. In this stage, individuals\nare buried in their social role and community, scarcely\nconceptualising, still less promoting, their own identity and\ninterests as distinguishable from those of the wider community.\n\nSecond, present (capitalist) societies are said to\nembody differentiated disunity. In this stage, independence\nand separation predominate, and individuals care only for themselves,\nscarcely thinking of the identity and interests of the wider\ncommunity. Indeed, they are typically isolated from, and indifferent\nor even hostile towards, the latter.\n\nThird, future (communist) societies are said to\nembody differentiated unity. In this stage, desirable\nversions of community and individuality flourish together. Indeed, in\ntheir new forms, communal and individual identities and communal and\nindividual interests presuppose and reinforce each other. It is\nsometimes said that the contents of the first two stages (community\nand individuality, respectively) have thereby been\n\u2018sublated\u2019\u2014that is, elevated, cancelled, and\npreserved\u2014in this third stage. \u2018Sublated\u2019 is an\nattempted English translation of the German verb\n\u2018aufheben\u2019and its cognates, which Hegel\noccasionally uses to suggest this elusive combination of ideas (e.g.\nHegel 1991b: \u00a724A3, \u00a781A1).\n\nIn the present context, the crucial historical stage is the second\none. This is the stage of alienation, the stage of disunity which\nemerges from a simple unity before reconciliation in a higher\n(differentiated) unity (Inwood 1992: 36). This is the stage associated\nwith present (capitalist) societies involving the problematic\nseparation of individuals from their social role and community. In the\nfirst historical stage (of past pre-capitalist societies) there is a\nproblematic relation, but no separation. And in the third historical\nstage (of future communist societies) there is a separation but it is\na healthy rather than problematic one. In this second historical stage\nof alienation, there is a loss, or lack, of something of value;\nroughly speaking, it is the loss or lack of the individuals\u2019\nattachment to their social role and community. (More precisely, we\nmight say that they have lost a sense of, and connection to, the\ncommunity, and that they lack a healthy sense of, and connection to,\nthe community.)\n\nHowever, this disvalue is not the whole of the historical story,\nethically speaking. In comparison with the first stage, the second\nstage also involves a liberation of sorts from the object in which\nsubjects were previously \u2018engulfed\u2019 (Cohen 1974: 239). The\n\u2018of sorts\u2019 is a way of acknowledging that this is a rather\ndistinctive kind of liberation. The individual here is not necessarily\nrid of the constraints of the other (of their social position and\ncommunity), but they do now at least identify and experience them as\nsuch\u2014that is, as constraints on the individual\u2014whereas\npreviously the individual was engulfed by that other and failed to\nthink of themselves as having any identity and interests outside of\ntheir social position. In short, the loss or lack of something of\nvalue is not the only feature of the second stage of alienation. There\nis also an important gain here, namely, the achievement of what we can\ncall \u2018individuality\u2019. This significant good was missing in\nthe first pre-capitalist stage, and\u2014freed from its present\ndistorting capitalist form\u2014it will be preserved and developed in\nthe communist future of the third historical stage.\n\nThis claim goes beyond the familiar suggestion that alienation forms a\nnecessary step in certain Hegelian and Marxist developmental\nnarratives. The suggestion here is that internal to the second stage,\nthe stage of alienation, there is both a problematic separation from\ncommunity and a positive liberation from engulfment. Those who see\nonly the negative thread in alienation, and fail to see \u2018what is\nbeing achieved within in and distorted by it\u2019, will miss an\nimportant, albeit subtle, thread in Marx\u2019s account of the\nprogressive character of capitalism (Cohen 1974: 253).\n\nThere is a lot going on in this schematic discussion of historical\nstages. The point emphasised here is that theorists\u2014even\ncritics\u2014of alienation need not assume that it is a wholly\nnegative phenomena, ethically speaking. Marx, for example, recognises\nthat the moment of alienation, for all its negative features, also\ninvolves the emergence of a good (individuality), which, in due course\n(and freed from the limitations of its historical origins), will be\ncentral to the human flourishing achieved in communist\nsociety.\n5.3 Morality as Alienating\n\nThis claim\u2014that alienation might not be a wholly negative\nphenomenon\u2014concerns the normative dimensions of alienation.\nHowever, it is sometimes suggested that the concept of alienation\nmight provide a standpoint from which morality itself, or at least\nsome forms of it, can be criticised. This looks to be a very\ndifferent kind of thought.\n\nThe broad suggestion is that morality, or certain conceptions of\nmorality, might embody, or encourage, alienation. More precisely,\nmorality, or certain conceptions of morality, might embody or\nencourage a problematic division of self and a problematic separation\nfrom much that is valuable in our lives. Consider, for example,\naccounts of the moral standpoint as requiring universalisation and\nequal consideration of all persons (Railton 1984: 138). It could seem\nthat adopting such a standpoint requires individuals to disown or\ndownplay the relevance of their more personal or partial (as opposed to impartial) beliefs and\nfeelings. The picture of persons divided into cognitive and affective\nparts, with the partial and personal relegated to the downgraded\nsphere of the latter (perhaps conceptualised as something closer to\nmere sentiment than reason) is a familiar one. In addition to that\nproblematic bifurcation of the self, such accounts might seem to cut\nus off from much that is valuable in our lives. If these impersonal\nkinds of moral consideration are to dominate our practical reasoning,\nthen it seems likely that an individual\u2019s particular\nattachments, loyalties, and commitments will have, at best, a marginal\nplace (Railton 1984: 139). In aspiring to adopt \u2018the point of\nview of the universe\u2019\u2014to use the well-known phrase of\nHenry Sidgwick (1838\u20131900) \u2013 there can sometimes seem to\nbe precious little security or space remaining for, say, friendship,\nlove, and family (Sidgwick 1907: 382). So understood, morality, or\ncertain conceptions of morality, are charged with embodying and\nencouraging alienation in the form of both a divided self, and a\nseparation of self and world.\n\nThe weight and scope of these kinds of concerns about alienation\ncan obviously vary; that is, they might be thought to have more or\nless critical purchase on a wider or narrower range of targets. There\nare various possibilities here. These concerns might, for\nexample, be said to apply: first, only to certain kinds of personality\ntypes inclined to adopt particular moral theories, and not to the\ntheories themselves (Piper 1987); second, only to certain ways of\nformulating particular moral theories (the objections here being\novercome by a more adequate formulation of\nthe particular theories in question); third, only to particular\nmoral theories (such as act utilitarianism, certain forms of\nconsequentialism, or all impartial moral theories) to which they\nconstitute foundational objections (but not to morality as such);\nand, fourth, as a foundational objection that counts\nagainst \u2018the peculiar institution\u2019 of morality itself\n(Williams 1985: 174). Given both that variety and the subject matter\nof this entry, it may not be helpful to generalise much more here.\nHowever, the point is hopefully made that the ethical dimensions of\nthe present topic extend beyond the normative assessment of the\nrelevant separations. Indeed, taking alienation seriously might lead\nus to think more critically about some familiar moral standpoints and\ntheories.\n6. Some (Unresolved) Empirical Issues\n6.1 Content\n\nThe above discussion of the concept of alienation\u2014clarifying its\nbasic shape, sketching some of its theoretical forms, and introducing\na few complexities\u2014still leaves many issues unresolved.\nThese include many empirical and quasi-empirical issues. The\npresent section is concerned with some of the\nempirical assumptions and claims that appear in what might be\ncalled broadly philosophical accounts of alienation of the kind\ndiscussed above. It is not directly concerned with the extensive\nsocial scientific literature on alienation. That latter\nliterature is often preoccupied\nwith \u2018operationalising\u2019 the concept\u2014for\ninstance, treating job satisfaction or absenteeism as proxies of\nalienated work\u2014in order to engineer predictive models in\ndisciplines (including education, psychology, sociology, and\nmanagement studies) dealing with a variety of real world contexts\n(see e.g. Chiaburu et al 2014).\n\nAs an example of some of the empirical dimensions of broadly\nphilosophical accounts of alienation, consider Marx\u2019s\ncharacterisation of capitalist society as characterised by\nseparations which frustrate self-realisation, especially\nself-realisation in work. To come to a considered judgement about the\nplausibility of his views on this topic, one would have to be in a\nposition to assess, amongst other issues, whether work in capitalist\nsocieties is necessarily alienated. One would need to judge not only\nwhether existing work is rightly characterised as alienated (as\nforced, frustrating self-realisation, not intended to satisfy the\nneeds of others, and not appropriately appreciated by those others),\nbut also, if so, whether it could be made meaningful and unalienated\nwithout undermining the very features which made the relevant society\na capitalist one. (There are, of course, also many more\nnormative-looking issues here regarding that account of human\nflourishing: whether, for example, Marx overestimates the value of\ncreative and fulfilling work, and underestimates the value of,\nsay, leisure and intellectual excellence.) Reaching anything like a\nconsidered judgment on these empirical and quasi-empirical issues\nwould clearly require some complicated factual assessments of, amongst\nother issues, the composition and functioning of human nature and the\nextant social world.\n6.2 Extent\n\nA range of complex empirical and quasi-empirical issues also look to\nbe woven into Marx\u2019s views about the historical extent of\nalienation. Consider the various claims about the\nhistorical location and comparative intensity of alienation that can\nbe found in his writings (and in certain secondary\ninterpretations of those writings). These include: first, that\ncertain systematic forms of alienation\u2014including alienation in\nwork\u2014are not a universal feature of human society (not least,\nthey will not be a feature of a future communist order); second, that\nat least some systematic forms of alienation\u2014presumably\nincluding the alienation that Marx identifies as embodied in religious belief \u2014are widespread in pre-capitalist\nsocieties; and third, that systematic forms of alienation are greater\nin contemporary capitalist societies than in pre-capitalist\nsocieties. There seems no good textual or theoretical reason to\nlumber Marx with the view that less systematic forms of alienation\u2014such as the hypothetical estrangement of Gillian from her sister Hanna (which arose from sibling rivalry, stubbornness, and a chance misunderstanding at a time of family crisis)\u2014could never exist under communism.\n\nTake the last of these assorted empirical claims attributed to Marx \u2013 the comparative\nverdict about the extent or intensity of systematic forms of alienation in capitalist\nsocieties. Its plausibility is scarcely incontrovertible given the\namount of sheer productive drudgery, and worse, in pre-capitalist\nsocieties. Nor is it obvious how one might attempt to substantiate the\nempirical dimensions of the claim. The empirical difficulties of\nmeasuring subjective alienation look considerable enough (especially\ngiven the limitations of historical data), but alienation for Marx is\nfundamentally about the frustration of objective human potentials,\nthose separations that prevent self-realisation, perhaps especially\nself-realisation in work. One suggestion, made in this context, is\nthat the scale of alienation in a particular society might be\nindicated by the gap between the liberating potential of human\nproductive powers, on the one hand, and the extent to which that\npotential is reflected in the lives actually lived by producers, on\nthe other (Wood 2004: 44\u201348). Whatever the appeal of that\nsuggestion, the social scientific details of how one might actually\napply that kind of measure in particular historical cases remain\nunclear.\n6.3 Prognosis\n\nRelated worries might also apply to claims about the prognosis for\nalienation, in particular, about whether and how alienation might be\novercome. Consider, for instance, Marx\u2019s view that communist\nsociety will be free of certain systematic forms of alienation, such\nas alienation in work. Marx\u2019s view about communism rests crucially on the judgement that it is the social relations of\ncapitalist society, and not its material or technical arrangements,\nwhich are the cause of systematic forms of alienation. For instance,\nhe holds that it is not the existence of science, technology, and\nindustrialisation, as such, which are at the root of the social and\npsychological ills of alienation, but rather how those factors tend to\nbe organised and used in a capitalist society. (For present\npurposes, just assume that a society is capitalist when its\neconomic structure is based on a particular class division \u2013 in\nwhich producers can only access means of production by selling their\nlabour power\u2014and when production, and much else, is driven\nby a remorseless search for profit.) In volume one of\nCapital, Marx writes approvingly of workers who, through time\nand experience, had learnt \u2018to distinguish between machinery and\nits employment by capital, and to direct their attacks, not against\nthe material instruments of production, but against the mode in which\nthey are used\u2019 (1996: 432). If this had not been his view, Marx\ncould not have, consistently, also suggested that communist society\n\u2013 which, on his account, is similarly technologically advanced\nand industrial\u2014could avoid this kind of alienation. This\nsuggestion is, nonetheless, strikingly sanguine. Marx is confident,\nfor instance, that the considerable gulf between the gloomy results of\nadopting machinery in the capitalist present (where it increases the\nrepetitiveness of tasks, narrows talents, promotes\n\u2018deskilling\u2019, and so on) and the bright promise of its\nadoption in the communist future (where it will liberate us from\nuncreative tasks, create greater wealth, develop all-round abilities,\nand so on) is easily bridged. However, Marx\u2019s\n\u2018utopophobia\u2019\u2014that is, his reluctance to say very\nmuch, in any close detail, about the future shape of socialist\nsociety \u2013 prevents him from offering any serious discussion\nabout how precisely this might be done (Leopold 2016). As a result,\neven the mildest of sceptics could reasonably worry that a range of\ndifficult empirical and other questions are evaded rather than\nanswered here.\n\nThis issue\u2014whether, and to what extent, alienation can be\novercome in modern societies\u2014is sometimes conflated with the\nissue of whether, and to what extent, alienation is a historically\nuniversal phenomena. To see that these are distinct questions,\nimagine that alienation only emerges in economically developed\nsocieties, that it is a necessary feature of economically developed\nsocieties, and that economically developed societies never revert\nvoluntarily to economically undeveloped ones. These are not\nimplausible claims, but together they seem to entail that, although\nonly a subset of historical societies are scarred by\nalienation, if you happen to live in an economically developed\nsociety, then\u2014involuntary Armageddon apart\u2014alienation will\nremain the fate of you and your successors.\n\nMy aim here is not to make significant progress in resolving any of\nthese empirical and quasi-empirical issues, but rather to\nacknowledge their existence and extent. Since the concept of\nalienation diagnoses a complex range of social ills involving self and\nother, it is perhaps not surprising that a variety of such issues\nare implicated in these various accounts of its proper\ncharacterisation, its historical scope, and the possibilities for\novercoming it. Nonetheless, it remains important to acknowledge the\nexistence and complexity of these empirical and quasi-empirical\nthreads, not least because they are not always adequately recognised\nor dealt with in the broadly philosophical discussions of alienation\nwhich are the focus of the discussion here. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Chiaburu, Dan S., Tomas Thundiyil, and Jiexin Wang, 2014,\n\u201cAlienation and its Correlates: A Meta-Analysis,\u201d\n<em>European Management Journal</em>, 32 (1): 24\u201336.", "Cohen, G.A., 1974, \u201cMarx\u2019s Dialectic of\nLabour,\u201d<em>Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs</em>, 3 (3):\n235\u2013261.", "Forst, Rainer,  2017, \u201cNoumenal Alienation: Rousseau,\nKant and Marx on the Dialectics of Self-Determination,\u201d\n<em>Kantian Review</em>, 22 (4): 523\u2013551.", "Foster, John Bellamy, 1999, \u201cMarx\u2019s Theory of\nMetabolic Rift: Classical Foundations for Environmental\nSociology,\u201d<em>American Journal of Sociology</em>, 105 (2):\n366\u2013405.", "Gilabert, Pablo, 2020, \u201cAlienation, Freedom, and\nDignity,\u201d <em>Philosophical Topics</em>, 48\n(2): 51\u201379.", "Hardimon, Michael O., 1994, <em>Hegel\u2019s Social Philosophy.\nThe Project of Reconciliation</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress.", "Haverkamp, Beatrijs, 2016, \u201cReconstructing Alienation: A\nChallenge to Social Critique?\u201d <em>Krisis</em>, 1: 66\u201371.", "Hegel, G.W.F., 1991a [1820], <em>Elements of the Philosophy of\nRight</em>, Allen W.
