    "main_text": "Outline and Content of the Works || On the Divine Names\n3.2 On the Divine Names\n\nStrictly speaking, all of the theological works except for the\nTheological Representations devote themselves to divine names\nor names for the godhead. But Dionysius devotes his second theological\ntreatise, entitled On the Divine Names only to a particular\nkind of divine name. This kind of name describes a third distinction\nwithin the godhead (in addition to the distinction of persons and of\npersonal attributes): the distinction into the multiple attributes of\nthe godhead as a whole. Though the names apply to the godhead as a\nwhole, and so refer to it as a unity, each name is different and so,\ntaken together, they differentiate the godhead. The implicit\ndistinction between the unity of the godhead and the multiplicity of\nthe names is reflected in the very structure of the names themselves.\nEach name includes the same prefix: \u201cover-\u201d, or\nhyper- in Greek, which indicates the unity of the godhead to\nwhom the names are applied. But each name is different, indicating the\nself-multiplication of the godhead. The result is a set of names like\n\u201cover-good,\u201d \u201cover-being,\u201d and\n\u201cover-life.\u201d Occasionally, Dionysius also makes use of a\nsecond, equivalent prefix: \u201cpre-\u201d or pro- in\nGreek. God is \u201cpre-good,\u201d and \u201cpre-being,\u201d\nmeaning that he has the attributes of creatures in a way that\ntranscends both creature and attribute. The \u201cover-\u201d and\n\u201cpre-\u201d prefixes must be applied strictly to the names when\nthey are used of God in himself. On the other hand, when the names are\nused only of God as cause, the prefixes may be left off, since the\ncausality of God is already a procession into the differentiation\nproperly signified by each of the different names.\n\nSome of Dionysius\u2019 later medieval interpreters suggest that God\npossesses the attributes of creatures in their most proper and ideal\nform, but Dionysius himself does not suggest this. Instead, the most\nproper object of the names is the highest creature. The exemplary\ninstances of \u201cgoodness,\u201d \u201cbeing,\u201d and\n\u201clife,\u201d for example, are the highest of the angels or\nintelligible minds, as Dionysius also calls them. For this reason,\nDionysius frequently refers to this type of name as an\n\u201cintelligible name.\u201d He incorporates into the number of\nintelligible names the traditional Neoplatonic intelligible\ncategories: being, identity, difference, rest, and motion, as well as\nthe Neoplatonic triad of being, life, and intellect. The fact that God\ntranscends the proper meaning of these names does not mean that he\nought to be called \u201cnon-being,\u201d \u201cnon-life,\u201d or\n\u201cnon-intellect.\u201d Dionysius prefers simply to say that God\nis \u201cover being,\u201d \u201cover life,\u201d and \u201cover\nintellect.\u201d\n\nThe intelligible names could form the ground of a theology independent\nof any specific religious tradition or sacred text. Many of them are\ncentral to Platonic sources outside the context of Christianity, and\nappear only incidentally and obscurely in the Hebrew and Christian\nscriptures. They also describe the intelligible structure of the\ncosmos, a structure that is accessible to all human inquiry, whether\nassisted by scriptural texts or not. But Dionysius explicitly denies\nthat the names may be acquired from any source other than the Hebrew\nand Christian scriptures. Even if the names could be derived from\ncontemplation of the world\u2019s intelligible structure, we apply\nthem in theology to the cause of that structure and not to the\nstructure itself. Since the cause of that structure is beyond the\ngrasp of human inquiry, we cannot rely on our own powers for our\ndescription. We depend instead on the revelation of the scriptures as\nour source for the intelligible names.\n\nFew human beings have the ability to contemplate the intelligible\nnames in their purity. Most of us require the names to be incarnated\nin visible things before we can understand them. Unable to see\n\u201cbeing,\u201d \u201clife,\u201d and \u201cwisdom\u201d in\nthemselves, we need a visible being who is living and wise. Such a\nperson can then become the means by which we contemplate the\nintelligible. Dionysius\u2019 possibly fictional teacher Hierotheus\nis one such visible incarnation of the names. But Hierotheus may do\nmore than incarnate the names. He can also unfold them in speech,\ntaking the unitary name of \u201cbeing\u201d and describing it at\nlength, as Dionysius does in the fifth chapter of On the Divine\nNames. As he describes it, the name unfolds itself into a form\nthat is more multiple, because of the many words used in his\ndescription. It thus approaches the multiple character of our ordinary\nhuman way of knowing, and becomes more easily understood.\n",
