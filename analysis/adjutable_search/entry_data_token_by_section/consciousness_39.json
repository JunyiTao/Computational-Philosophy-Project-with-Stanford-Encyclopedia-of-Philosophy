    "main_text": "Specific Theories of Consciousness || Information Integration Theory\n9.6 Information Integration Theory \n\n\nThe integration of information from many sources is an important\nfeature of consciousness and, as noted above (section 6.4), is often\ncited as one of its major functions.  Content integration plays an\nimportant role in various theories especially global workspace theory\n(section 9.3).  However, a proposal by the neuroscientist Giulio\nTononi (2008) goes further in identifying consciousness with\nintegrated information and asserting that information integration of\nthe relevant sort is both necessary and sufficient for consciousness\nregardless of the substrate in which it is realized (which need not be\nneural or biological).  According to Tononi's Integrated Information\nTheory (IIT), consciousness is a purely information-theoretic property\nof systems.  He proposes a mathematical measure \u03c6 that aims to\nmeasure not merely the information in the parts of a given system but\nalso the information contained in the organization of the system over\nand above that in its parts. \u03c6 thus corresponds to the system's\ndegree of informational integration.  Such a system can contain many\noverlapping complexes and the complex with the highest \u03c6 value\nwill be conscious according to IIT.\n According to IIT, consciousness varies in quantity and comes in\nmany degrees which correspond to \u03c6 values.  Thus even a simple\nsystem such a single photo diode will be conscious to some degree if\nit is not contained within a larger complex.  In that sense, IIT\nimplies a form of panpsychism that Tononi explicitly endorses.\nAccording to IIT, the quality of the relevant consciousness is\ndetermined by the totality of informational relations within the\nrelevant integrated complex.  Thus IIT aims to explain both the\nquantity and quality of phenomenal consciousness.  Other\nneuroscientists, notably Christof Koch, have also endorsed the IIT\napproach (Koch 2012).\n",
