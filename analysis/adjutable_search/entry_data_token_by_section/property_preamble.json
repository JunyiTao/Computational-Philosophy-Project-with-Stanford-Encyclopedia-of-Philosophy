    "main_text": "\n\nProperty is a general term for rules governing access to and control\nof land and other material resources. Because these rules are\ndisputed, both in regard to their general shape and in regard to their\nparticular application, there are interesting philosophical issues\nabout the justification of property. Modern philosophical discussions\nfocus mostly on the issue of the justification of private\nproperty rights (as opposed to common or collective property).\n\u2018Private property\u2019 refers to a kind of system that\nallocates particular objects like pieces of land to particular\nindividuals to use and manage as they please, to the exclusion of\nothers (even others who have a greater need for the resources) and to\nthe exclusion also of any detailed control by society. Though these\nexclusions make the idea of private property seem problematic,\nphilosophers have often argued that it is necessary for the ethical\ndevelopment of the individual, or for the creation of a social\nenvironment in which people can prosper as free and responsible\nagents.\n",
