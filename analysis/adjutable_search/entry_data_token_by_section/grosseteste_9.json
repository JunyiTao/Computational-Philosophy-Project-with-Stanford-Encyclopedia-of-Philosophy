Exemplarism, Truth and Illumination\n10.1 Exemplarism\n Grosseteste\u2019s exemplarism (see Lynch 1941) is in part an\nadaptation of Plato\u2019s theory of Ideas to a Christian framework. Like\nother medieval thinkers, Grosseteste takes the existence of an\neternal, self-subsistent realm of Platonic Ideas to be inconsistent\nwith the dependence of all things on God.  Nevertheless, following\nAugustine and Seneca, he does not reject the Platonic ideas\noutright. Rather, he treats them as eternal models (exempla)\nor, as he also calls them, reasons (rationes) of things in\nGod\u2019s mind. Like the Platonic ideas, these reasons function as\nparadigms or models created things can accord with or fall short of.\nGod looks to these reasons of things in creation, somewhat as a\ncraftsman looks to the idea in his mind of what he is to make. \n Given that God is absolutely simple, the reasons of things in\nGod\u2019s mind must in the final analysis be identified with God. Thus\nGrosseteste moves between speaking of the reasons in God\u2019s mind as\nexemplars or models and speaking of God himself as such. Indeed, he\ndescribes God, following Augustine in the Confessions and\nDe libero arbitrio, as first form, noting expressly that he\nis not using the notion of form in this connection in Aristotle\u2019s\nsense as what enters into a form-matter composite (as the first form\ncorporeity does) (Luard 1861, 4; Goering and Mantello 2010, 38). In On the Halt of Causes he\nidentifies the first form, God, with \u201cthe form that is both a model\nand that in virtue of which a thing is\u201d and notes that this form \u201cis\nnot conjoined with a thing but exists on its own, simple and\nseparate. This is the first form, and how it is the first form is hard\nto explain\u201d (Baur 1912, 125).\n10.2 Truth\n Grosseteste wrote in a tradition that employed the concept of\ntruth in a number of different contexts. We may speak not only of the\ntruth of propositions or thoughts, but also of things\u2014e.g. of\na tree or a human being\u2014and God himself or the eternal Word is\nidentified with truth. In his treatise On Truth Grosseteste\ntakes up the question, raised by Anselm, whether there is just one\ntruth (veritas), God, or many truths (veritates).\nBut much of his account is concerned to present a uniform conception\nof truth that embraces these different applications of the term noted\nabove. The doctrine of eternal exemplar forms plays an important role\nin this account.\n According to Grosseteste\u2019s treatise On Truth, truth is\nthe conformity or adequation of things and speech, or more\nparticularly, the thought expressed by speech.  This conception of\ntruth as adequation had only recently entered the Latin West, but\nGrosseteste gives it a twist all his own, taking the speech in\nquestion to be that of God, the eternal Word. Thus truth\n(veritas) is a conformity between things and the eternal\nWord. Grosseteste claims that the eternal Word is itself its very own\nconformity to itself and thus may be identified with truth. As for\ncreated things, their truth is their conformity to their eternal model\nor reason in the eternal Word. Likewise, the truth of \npropositions\u2014a subclass of things\u2014is their conformity to their\neternal model or reason in the eternal Word. This, on first\nappearance, would appear to clash with the idea that a proposition\u2019s\ntruth is not its conformity to anything in God, but rather to the\nstate of affairs in the world whose obtaining it asserts; but this\nappearance is deceptive.  A thing\u2019s conformity to its eternal reason,\nits truth, is its having the being its exemplar specifies. Now,\nGrosseteste holds that created items have two kinds of being or\nperfection. In his commentary on the Posterior Analytics he\nholds that the second perfection of a thing is \u201cthe completion of the\nactivity of the thing to which it has, as such, been established to be\nfitted and for the sake of which it has been established\u201d (Rossi 1981,\n240).  The first being of a thing is its simply being the kind of\nthing it is.  Thus, there is a twofold conformity possible of things\nto their eternal reasons. On the one hand, the eternal reason of a\nthing specifies the very kind of thing that thing is, and simply in\nvirtue of existing as an item of a determinate kind a thing will\nnecessarily conform to its exemplar in this respect and be true. Thus\nall human beings and all propositions are true, in this sense, in that\nthey are the kinds of things they are, this being specified by their\nexemplar. A human being is a composite of body and soul, and a\nproposition is \u201cthe statement of one thing about another or one thing\nfrom another\u201d (Baur 1912, 143). On the other hand, the eternal reason\nspecifies the second perfection a thing ought to have but may\nnonetheless lack. In this sense a human being will be a false human\nbeing if, for example, she is vicious, falling short of the perfection\nof virtue specified in the eternal reason of a human being. Likewise,\na proposition will be a false proposition if it fails to perform the\nfunction of a proposition, this being to state things as they in fact\nare in the world.  Thus, the ordinary notion of propositional truth,\ndescribed by Aristotle as \u201cto so be in the thing signified as speech\nsays,\u201d is a matter of a proposition\u2019s conformity, in respect of second\nbeing, to its eternal reason, and this is for it to perform the\nfunction perfective of propositions, namely, to be in conformity to\nthe states of affairs it asserts.\n With this account of truth Grosseteste thinks he can accommodate\nwithin one schema the divergent conceptions of truth present in his\nday. As to the initial question he drew from Anselm, whether there is\njust one truth or many, diverging from Anselm, who posits a single truth, he holds that there are many truths\n(veritates), for otherwise the term \u201ctruth\u201d could\nnot admit a plural or be distributed (by which he means we\ncould not speak of \u201cevery truth\u201d) (for the relation between Anselm\u2019s and Grosseteste\u2019s accounts of truth, see Noone 2010).  Nevertheless, he concludes that\n\u201cthere is a single truth that the name \u2018truth\u2019 everywhere\nsignifies and predicates\u2014namely, the supreme\ntruth\u2014though this one truth is called many truths in the many\ntruths of things\u201d (Baur 1912, 139).  Thus, for Grosseteste any use of\nthe term \u201ctruth\u201d involves in some way a reference to the supreme\ntruth, God.\n10.3  Illumination\nUnder Augustine\u2019s influence Grosseteste subscribes to an\nilluminationist account of human knowledge, according to which human\nknowledge is understood by analogy to bodily vision: as a body can\nonly be seen if light is shed on it and the eyes, so something can\nonly be known if a spiritual light is shed on it and the mind\u2019s\neye. Grosseteste presents versions of such an account in his\ntreatise On Truth and in his commentary on the Posterior\nAnalytics.\nIn On Truth Grosseteste presents an illuminationist theory\nof knowledge after outlining his theory of truth. Because created\ntruth is a conformity between things and their eternal reasons, we can\nonly know created truth if we know that a created thing conforms to\nits eternal reason in God. But as we can only see a body as colored if\nan external light is shed on its color, rendering it actually visible\nto us, so in order for us to see a created thing as true, an external\nlight must be shed on its truth, rendering it actually visible to\nus. This truth is the adequation of the thing and its eternal reason\nin God\u2019s mind, and thus an external light, the light of the Supreme\nTruth, God, must be shed on both the thing and its eternal reason if\nit is to be visible to the mind. Grosseteste hastens to point out that\nthis doesn\u2019t require that the knower see God himself or even be aware\nof God, for only the pure of heart see God as he is in himself in the\nface-to-face vision of God. All the same, all who know truth must in\nsome way have at least an unwitting cognition of the Supreme Truth and\nits light, and in it a vision of the eternal reasons, that falls short\nof the direct vision of God.\nGrosseteste makes no reference to Aristotle\u2019s views on knowledge\nin On Truth but draws on Augustine and Anselm. But in the\ncommentary on the Posterior Analytics, which appears to be\nthe earlier of the two works, he relates an illuminationist conception\nof knowledge to Aristotle\u2019s account of scientific knowledge. Scholars\ndisagree, however, regarding Grosseteste\u2019s intentions in this\nregard. Some (Gilson 1926\u20137, Lynch 1941, McEvoy 1982) take his\ntreatment of Aristotle\u2019s account of scientific knowledge to accord no\nrole to Aristotle\u2019s notion of abstraction, in whose place Grosseteste\ninstead employs an Augustinian conception of divine\nillumination. Others (Marrone 1983), treating On Truth as the\nearlier work, take Grosseteste now to reject an account of divine\nillumination in our knowledge in this life and hold his references to\nillumination in the context of scientific knowledge to refer to a\nlight the human soul itself sheds on intelligible things in a process\nof abstraction understood along Aristotle\u2019s lines. The truth, however,\nas Van Dyke 2009 argues, seems to be that Grosseteste is concerned to\nsubsume Aristotle\u2019s account of scientific knowledge under a broader\naccount of cognition in which divine illumination plays a crucial role\nin all cognition, while at the same time he endorses the account of\nscientific knowledge and abstraction presented in the Posterior\nAnalytics. The following remarks briefly examine some aspects of\nthis attempt. (For further discussion and more technical aspects of\nGrosseteste\u2019s account of demonstrative science, see the entry on\nMedieval Theories of Demonstration, as well as Crombie 1953, Evans 1983, Laird\n1987, Longeway 2007, McEvoy 1982, Marrone 1983, 1986, Rossi 1995, Serene 1979, Van\nDyke 2009 and 2010, and Wallace 1972.)\nThe Posterior Analytics is concerned to provide an account\nof scientia or \u201cscientific knowledge.\u201d By this is\nmeant not scientific knowledge in the modern sense of a body of theory\nbased on the experimental testing of hypotheses, but rather an\nunderstanding of the reason why a given fact obtains\n(knowledge propter quid), as opposed to knowledge simply that\nthe fact does obtain (knowledge quia), what might be\ndescribed as a certain kind of explanatory knowledge. An Aristotelian\nscience is a systematization of such knowledge based on the structure\nof Euclid\u2019s axiomatic geometry and employing Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic\nlogic. One arrives at scientia of a given fact by deriving it\nas the conclusion of a syllogism whose premises meets certain\nstringent conditions that render them explanatory of that fact. As\nGrosseteste puts it, the premises or principles\u2013i.e., starting\npoints\u2013of such a syllogism must be true, immediate, prior and\nbetter known than the conclusion, must state causes, be necessary,\nconcern essential connections, be universal, everlasting, and\nincorruptible. A syllogism that meets these conditions is called a\ndemonstrative syllogism or demonstration and will provide explanatory\nknowledge of its conclusion. At one point Grosseteste states that only\nmathematics is comprised of demonstrations in this strict sense,\nthough in another passage he suggests that theology would most fully\nmeet these conditions, apparently meaning that the demonstrative\nknowledge possible for us in this life (mathematics) is to be\ndistinguished from that which is possible in the afterlife\n(theology). The sciences of natural phenomena do not, Grosseteste\nclaims, fully meet the requirements for a fully demonstrative science,\nthough if we relax the conditions governing demonstrations somewhat we\nmay speak of a demonstrative science of natural phenomena (see the\nentry on Medieval Theories of Demonstration for details).\nAccording to Grosseteste, the Posterior Analytics is not\nconcerned to provide a method for arriving at demonstrations but\nrather to provide criteria to evaluate whether a given syllogism\ncounts as a demonstration. Nevertheless, Aristotle does discuss the\nsource of the principles and definitions employed in demonstrations,\nand it is in considering these remarks, in particular, that\nGrosseteste introduces the ideas of mental vision and the illumination\nof the mind.\nAccording to Aristotle, it is from sense experience that we obtain\nthe universal concepts and principles of a science. Thus, if someone\nlacks a sense, he will also lack the scientific knowledge involving\nthe concepts and principles derived from exercise of that sense. But\nGrosseteste holds that God and the intelligences (i.e., angels) know\nwithout reliance on the senses, and the intellective power, the\nhighest part of the human soul, relies on no bodily sense or organ in\nits proper operation. Instead, its proper operation involves a mental\nvision in which one arrives at knowledge of things by viewing their\nexemplar forms or reasons in an irradiation received from God or an\nintelligence.\nGrosseteste reconciles this doctrine with Aristotle\u2019s teachings by\nholding that with rare exceptions most individuals in the present life\ndo not have knowledge of this sort; their intellective power is\n\u201csick\u201d and unable to perform its proper operation. In the\npresent life the highest form of knowledge possible for most human\nbeings is Aristotelian demonstrative science, and for this sense\nexperience is indeed required.\nThis might suggest that Grosseteste reserves the notion of mental\nillumination simply for the proper operation of the intellective part\nof the soul. But this is not so. Mental vision and an illumination of\nthe mind are involved even in the operation of our rational power in\ndemonstrative science.\nAlluding to Wisdom 9: 15, Grosseteste holds the\nintellective power is sick because it is darkened and weighed down by\nthe corrupt body. He intimates that human beings are born in this\ncondition, presumably as a consequence of the fall. He likens this\ndarkening of the mind to a cloudy day: as bodily vision is darkened by\nclouds, so the operation of the cognitive powers is darkened by bodily\nappearances (phantasmata), which obstruct our mental vision\nand render it unable to see intelligible items in their purity. This\ndarkening of the mind, Grosseteste holds, is the source of all\nerror. In grasping the principles of demonstration, reason is\nstimulated to leave this darkness. In a newborn human being the powers\nof the rational soul are as if asleep and unable to act. But sense\nexperience in some way involves reason, and through repeated sense\nexperience reason is woken up and carried by the senses to perceptible\nthings. Reason then begins to distinguish and view apart the features\nconfused in sense experience, thereby formulating universal\nconcepts. Repeated experience of correlated perceptible phenomena\nleads the senses to estimate an imperceptible relationship between\nthem\u2014a causal connection, for example. This too awakens reason\nand leads it to wonder whether this connection in fact\nobtains. Grosseteste uses an example, drawn from Avicenna, of the\nclaim that scammony of itself causes the discharge of red\nbile. Wondering whether this is true, we set up what we should now\ncall a controlled experiment in which we exclude other known causes of\nthe discharge of red bile and give someone scammony to see what will\nhappen. And in this way, Grosseteste writes, we arrive \u201cfrom\nsense at an observational (experimentale) universal\nprinciple\u201d (Rossi 1981, 215).\nGrosseteste describes this as the process in which the mind is\nstimulated on the occasion of sense experience to seek and find its\nown light\u2014to turn from corruptible corporeal objects to\nintelligible things. The mind moves out of the darkness it is in to\nfind a trace of its light, which stands to it as the sun stands to the\neyes in bodily vision. As he puts it in discussing certainty,\n\u201cthere is a spiritual light shed on intelligible things and the\nmind\u2019s eye, and this light is related to the inner eye and\nintelligible things in the way the bodily sun is related to bodily\neyes and visible bodily things\u201d (Rossi 1981,\n240\u2013241). Understanding (intellectus) and demonstrative\nknowledge are \u201clike the vision of healthy eyes through the\nmedium of pure air with clear light spread over the colored\nobject\u2026Understanding and demonstrative knowledge apprehend\nthings in the purity of their essence, as they are in\nthemselves\u201d (Rossi 1981, 279\u2013280).\nThese remarks indicate that for Grosseteste some sort of spiritual\nlight and vision is involved in scientific knowledge, but they also\nstrongly suggest that Grosseteste is wedded to an Aristotelian account\nin which the human mind abstracts intelligible items from the data of\nsense. These intelligible items would appear to be the genera and\nspecies of created things, viewed as immanent Aristotelian universals,\nthe second lowest level of a hierarchy of universals Grosseteste sets\nout in the commentary, the highest being the reasons of things in the\ndivine mind. But what exactly is the nature of the vision and\nillumination involved in scientific knowledge? In particular, in his\naccount of demonstrative science, and thus of the sort of knowledge\npossible for most of us in this life, is Grosseteste employing a\nnotion of divine illumination, as he clearly does in his\ntreatise On Truth?\nMarrone 1983, ch. 6, suggests he is not: the light Grosseteste\nmentions is a light, he thinks, that the mind itself sheds on items to\nrender them intelligible and the notions of light and vision play no\nessential role in Grosseteste\u2019s understanding of Aristotelian science:\nthe commentary displays a movement away from the conception of\nknowledge in On Truth in terms of divine illumination towards\na purely naturalistic conception of knowledge. But this view\npresupposes the implausible chronology according to which On\nTruth was written before the commentary and, as van Dyke 2009\npoints out, fits poorly with Grosseteste\u2019s analogy between the light\ninvolved in scientific knowledge and the light shed by the sun in\nbodily vision, which comes from a source apart from the\nsenses. So too, it seems, the light involved in scientific knowledge\nis a light that a source apart from the mind, namely God (or possibly\nan intelligence), sheds on objects of scientific knowledge so as to\nrender them actually intelligible, in the way the light the sun sheds\non bodies makes them actually visible. \n11.  Scientific Method\nGrosseteste\u2019s numerous short scientific works made no significant\ncontribution to scientific theory. Yet it has been argued that\nGrosseteste played a key role in the development of scientific\nmethod.  In particular, Crombie 1955 (a summary of Crombie\n1953) has claimed (1) that Grosseteste was the first in the Latin West\nto develop an account of an experimental method in science (98); (2)\nthat he \u201cseems to have been the first writer to make systematic\nuse of a method of experimental verification and falsification\u201d\n(107); (3) that he gave a \u201cspecial importance to mathematics in\nattempting to provide scientific explanations of the physical\nworld\u201d (111).  These claims have been the subject of\nconsiderable debate. \n The claim that Grosseteste developed an account of experimental\nmethod in science puts great weight on the aforementioned passage in\nwhich Grosseteste describes a controlled experiment to see whether\nscammony causes the discharge of red bile.  There can be little doubt\nthat Grosseteste does indeed have in mind the idea of a controlled\nexperiment. The question, however, is whether Grosseteste makes the\nnotion of controlled experiment part of a general account of a\nscientific method for arriving at the principles of demonstrative\nscience. The evidence that he does so is not strong. The discussion of\nscammony is the only reference to controlled experiment in his\nwritings, and when Grosseteste refers back to this discussion later in\nthe commentary as explaining how we come to acquire experiential\nprinciples, the notion of controlled experiment is sometimes\ninapplicable\u2014as for example, regarding our knowledge of\nthe cause of an eclipse. Moreover, Grosseteste is quite prepared to\ngrant that in some cases we can know causal connections after only a\nsingle perception (see Marrone 1986).  On balance, we may say that\nGrosseteste did employ the notion of controlled\nexperiment and related it to demonstrative science, but he hardly set\nit up as the method by which such knowledge is to be obtained; it is\none among many ways of arriving at such knowledge and is not accorded\nthe emphasis it has been given in scholarly commentary.\n As for Grosseteste\u2019s actual practice in his scientific writings,\nif by an experimental method is meant a method of controlled\nexperiment, then it must be said that Grosseteste makes no use of such\na method in these writings. He arrives at his conclusions in his\nscientific writings on the basis of a mix of considerations.  He\nappeals to authority and everyday observation (\u201cexperimentum\u201d\nin Latin) and makes use of thought experiments and certain\nmetaphysical assumptions, such as that \u201cevery operation of\nnature occurs in the most finite, ordered, shortest and best way\npossible for it\u201d (Baur 1912, 75). Nowhere does he describe a\ncontrolled experiment as the basis of his conclusions (see Eastwood\n1968, regarding Grosseteste\u2019s works in optics). We may grant that\nGrossetete does cite empirical observation as one factor among others\nwhen he assesses the adequacy of certain accounts of natural\nphenomena, but this is far from employing a method of experimental\nverification and falsification in the sense of a controlled\nexperiment.\n The claim that Grosseteste gave a \u201cspecial importance to\nmathematics in attempting to provide scientific explanations of the\nphysical world\u201d is on a stronger footing. In the opening of the\ntreatise On Lines, Angles and Figures Grosseteste remarks\nthat \u201cthe consideration of lines, angles and figures is of the\ngreatest utility since it is impossible for natural philosophy to be\nknown without them \u2026. All causes of natural effects have to be\ngiven through lines, angles and figures, for otherwise it is\nimpossible for the reason why (propter quid) to be known in\nthem\u201d (Baur 1912, 59\u201360).  In the treatise, On the Nature of\nPlaces, which is a continuation of On Lines, Angles and\nFigures, Grosseteste sums up the preceding text with the remark\nthat \u201cthe diligent investigator of natural phenomena can give\nthe causes of all natural effects, therefore, in this way by the rules\nand roots and foundations given from the power of geometry\u201d\n(Baur 1912, 65). Undoubtedly, then, Grosseteste saw a key role for\ngeometry in the explanation of natural phenomena. \n At the basis of this view was Grosseteste\u2019s view that natural\nagents act by the multiplication of their power or species, a view\nRoger Bacon was to develop in detail.  Grosseteste was, of course,\nthinking of the action of light. He holds that knowledge propter\nquid must be through angles, lines and figures because a\n\u201cnatural agent multiplies its power from itself to what it acts\nupon, whether it act upon the senses or upon matter\u201d (Baur 1912,\n60).  Grosseteste holds that the intensity of operation of the natural\nagent will be a matter of its distance from what it acts upon, the\nangle at which it strikes it, and the figure in which it multiplies\nits operation, this being either a sphere or cone. He establishes\ncertain rudimentary rules to this effect, such as that the shorter the\ndistance, the stronger the operation. \nThe remarks above should not blind us to the fact that Grosseteste\nwas deeply concerned with the detailed investigation of natural\nphenomena.  It was the inspiration of this attitude of mind, together\nwith Grosseteste\u2019s emphasis on the importance of mathematics, that was\nperhaps his chief legacy to thinkers in fourteenth-century Oxford who\nwere developing the beginnings of a mathematical physics.\n12. Influence\nBy the fourteenth century, Grosseteste had achieved the unusual\nstatus of being an authoritative figure for Oxford\nthinkers\u2014someone from whose writings quotations might be\nmarshalled, on the strength of his name, in defense of one\u2019s\nviews. Thus, both Thomas Bradwardine and Thomas Buckingham appeal to\nGrosseteste in support of their conflicting views on future\ncontingency. John Wyclif likewise appeals to Grosseteste as a fellow\ntraveller in support of his views on the continuum, among other\nissues, ranking him with Plato, Democritus and Augustine as one of the\ngreatest of thinkers. Such appeals are signs of the reverence with\nwhich Grosseteste was held in fourteenth-century Oxford.  \nThe influence of specific ideas of Grosseteste\u2019s may be found in\nnumerous thinkers, especially those who flourished at Oxford. Their\nnumber includes Adam of Wodeham, John Wyclif, Robert Kilwardby, Thomas Bradwardine, Thomas Buckingham, Thomas of York, Walter Burley, William of Alnwick, William of Ockham, and others. But his greatest influence as\na philosopher, if we leave aside his commentary on the Posterior analytics, was perhaps as a source of ideas for thinkers\nflourishing in the first half of the thirteenth century. In\nparticular, Richard Rufus of Cornwall makes extensive use of\nGrosseteste\u2019s writings in his large Scriptum on Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics and his Oxford commentary on the Sentences\nof Peter Lombard, as does his Oxford contemporary Richard Fishacre in\nhis commentary on the Sentences. These thinkers were heavily\ninfluenced by Grosseteste\u2019s On Free Decision as well as by his\nwritings on the eternity of the world. Rufus also praises\nGrosseteste\u2019s scientific and mathematical expertise, as does Roger\nBacon, a man by temperament more given to scorn than praise.\nGrosseteste\u2019s philosophical influence on the Continent appears to\nhave been largely as a scholar of Aristotle. His commentary on the\nPosterior Analytics achieved renown across the Continent and\nwas used throughout the middle ages (for its influence in Britain see Rossi 2012), and the same was true of his\ntranslation of the Ethics.  Indeed, these two pieces of\nAristotelian scholarship alone would have sufficed to acquire for\nGrossetete an important place in the history of medieval thought. One exception, however, is the fourteenth-century French thinker, Nicole Oresme, who makes use of a number of Grosseteste\u2019s philosophical and scientific writings in his works, most notably in his Questiones super Physicam.",
