    "main_text": "Applications and Motivation || Defeasible Reasons\n2.4 Defeasible Reasons\n\nJonathan Dancy (Dancy 1993, 2004) has developed and defended an\nanti-Humean conception of practical reasoning, according to which it\nis the facts themselves, and not our desires, aversions, or other\nattitudes towards those facts, that constitute reasons for\nacting. These facts consist of particulars\u2019 having\nproperties, and those properties provide in each such case some reason\nfor acting--as, for example, someone\u2019s need can provide a reason\nfor meeting that need. However, each general property can provide a\nreason only defeasibly: not only can a reason be overwhelmed by\ncontrary considerations, but a property\u2019s valence for action can\nbe completely neutralized or even reversed by further considerations.\nFor example, even if giving pleasure is in general a reason in favor\nof acting in a certain way, the fact that some action would give\npleasure to those pleased by the suffering of others is a reason \nagainst and not for so acting. Dancy has introduced (in Dancy\n2004) the concepts of intensifiers and attenuators,\napplying to facts that strengthen or weaken the force of reasons. In\nthe extreme case, a fact can disable a reason altogether,\ncorresponding to what Joseph Raz had described as an exclusionary\nreason (Raz 1975), and to John Pollock\u2019s idea of an\n undercutting defeater.\n\nTo the extent that our practical reasoning is guided at all by general\nrules or principles (something that Dancy explicitly denies), the\nreasoning must be defeasible, as John Horty has argued (Horty 2007b).\nFrom this perspective, Dancy\u2019s thesis of moral\nparticularism corresponds to the potential defeasibility of all\ngeneral reasons (see Lance and Little 2004, 2007). Defeasible logic\ncan enable general rules to play an indispensable role despite the\nreasons holism that Dancy has uncovered.\n\nIn addition, defeasible reasoning can be used to illuminate moral and\nlegal dilemmas, cases in which general rules come into conflict (see\nHorty 1994, 2003). This can be done without attributing logical\ninconsistency to the conflicting rules and without treating the\nconflict as merely apparent, i.e., as due to an incomplete\nrepresentation of the rules.\n",
