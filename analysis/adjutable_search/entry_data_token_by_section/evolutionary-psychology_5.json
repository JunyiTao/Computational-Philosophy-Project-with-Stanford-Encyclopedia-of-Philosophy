    "main_text": "Human Nature\n6. Human Nature\n\nEvolutionary psychology is well suited to providing an account of\nhuman nature. As noted above (Section 1), evolutionary psychology owes\na theoretical debt to human sociobiology. E.O. Wilson took human\nsociobiology to provide us with an account of human nature (1978). For\nWilson human nature is the collection of universal human behavioral\nrepertoires and these behavioral repertoires are best understood as\nbeing products of natural selection. Evolutionary psychologists argue\nthat human nature is not a collection of universal human behavioral\nrepertoires but rather the universal psychological mechanisms\nunderlying these behaviors (Tooby and Cosmides 1990). These universal\npsychological mechanisms are products of natural selection, as we saw\nin Section 2. above. Tooby and Cosmides put this claim as follows:\n\u201cthe concept of human nature is based on a species-typical\ncollection of complex psychological adaptations\u201d (1990, 17). So,\nfor evolutionary psychologists, \u201chuman nature consists of a set\nof psychological adaptations that are presumed to be universal among,\nand unique to, human beings\u201d (Buller 2005, 423). Machery\u2019s\n(2008) nomological account of human nature is based on, and very\nsimilar to, the evolutionary psychologists\u2019 account. Machery\nsays that \u201chuman nature is the set of properties that humans\ntend to possess as a result of the evolution of their species\u201d\n(2008, 323). While Machery\u2019s account appeals to traits that have\nevolved and are universal (common to all humans), it is not limited to\npsychological mechanisms. For example, he thinks of bi-pedalism as\npart of the human nature trait cluster. Machery\u2019s view captures\nelements of both the sociobiological view and the evolutionary\npsychology view of human nature. He shares the idea that a trait must\nbe a product of evolution, rather than say social learning or\nenculturation, with both these accounts.\n\nSome critical challenges to evolutionary psychological accounts of\nhuman nature (and the nomological account) derive from similar\nconcerns as those driving criticism of evolutionary psychology in\ngeneral. In Section 4. we see that discussions of evolutionary\npsychology are founded on disagreements about how adaptation should be\ncharacterized and disagreements about the role of variation in\nevolution. Some critics charge evolutionary psychologists of assuming\nthat adaptation cannot sustain variation. Buller\u2019s (2005)\ncriticism of evolutionary psychologists\u2019 account of human nature\nalso invokes variation (cf. Hull 1986; and Sober 1980). The idea here\nis that humans, like all organisms, exhibit a great deal of variation,\nincluding morphological, physiological, behavioral and cultural\nvariation (cf. Amundson 2000). Buller argues that the evolutionary\npsychology account of human nature either ignores or fails to account\nfor all of this variation (c.f. Lewens 2015; Odenbaugh Forthcoming;\nand Ramsey 2013). Any account that restricts human nature to just\nthose traits we have in common and which also are not subject to\nchange, cannot account for human variation.\n\nBuller\u2019s (2005) criticism of evolutionary psychologists\u2019\nnotion of human nature (or the nomological account) is based on the\nidea that we vary across many dimensions and an account of human\nnature based on fixed, universal traits cannot account for any of this\nvariation. The idea that to account for human nature, we must account\nfor human variation is presented and defended by evolutionary\npsychologists (see e.g. Barrett 2015), anthropologists (see e.g.\nCashdan 2013) and philosophers (see e.g. Griffiths 2011 and Ramsey\n2013). Barrett agrees with Buller (and others) that evolutionary\npsychologists have failed to account for human variation in their\naccount of human nature. Rather than seeing this challenge as a knock\ndown of the whole enterprise of accounting for human nature, Barrett\nsees this as a challenge for an account of human nature. Barrett says\n\u201cWhatever human nature is, it\u2019s a biological phenomenon\nwith all that implies\u201d (2015, 321). So, human nature is \u201ca\nbig wobbly cloud that is different from the population clouds of\nsquirrels and palm trees. To understand human minds and behaviors, we\nneed to understand the properties of our own cloud, as messy as it\nmight be\u201d (2015, 232). Rather than human nature being a\ncollection of shared fixed universal psychological traits, for\nBarrett, human nature is the whole human trait cluster, including all\nof the variation in all of our traits. This approach to human nature\nis sharply different than the approach defended by either Wilson,\nTooby and Cosmides or Machery but is also subject to a number of\ncriticisms. The main thrust of the criticisms is that such a view\ncannot be explanatory and is instead merely a big list of all the\nproperties that humans have had and can have (See e.g. Buller 2005;\nDownes 2016; Futuyma 1998; and Lewens 2015). Discussion over the\ntension between evolutionary psychologists\u2019 views and the\nmanifest variation in human traits continues in many areas that\nevolutionary psychologists focus on. Another example of this broader\ndiscussion is included in Section 7. below.\n",
