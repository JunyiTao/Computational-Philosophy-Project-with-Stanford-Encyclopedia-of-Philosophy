    "main_text": "The Rationalist Deployment of Nativism: Descartes & Leibniz\n3. The Rationalist Deployment of Nativism: Descartes & Leibniz\n\n\nIntelligibility is at the heart of the revival of the innateness\ndoctrine in the modern period. From the very start of the Western\ntradition, it has been widely accepted that we not only sense the\nworld, but that we also make sense of it; that it is not only\nsensible but also intelligible. Platonism\nexplains intelligibility in terms of the innate forms that we are\nreminded of by sense-experience. Aristotelianism explains\nintelligibility in terms of a richer theory of perception \u2013 viz.,\nit holds that we receive the intelligible nature of things\nfrom the things themselves. The scientific revolution of the\n17th century, with its stress on the distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities and its materialist conception of the\nphysical world, undercut the Aristotelian view of perception\ncompletely. The problem can be illustrated with the new account\nof vision. What happens when we see, according to the new\nscientific picture, is that light bouncing off an object carries a\npattern of motion to the eye. These motions cause motions in the\nbrain, and (somehow) conscious visual experience results. How can\nwe explain the richness of our conception of the world given that only\nmotions reach the sense organs? There seems to be no natural way\nto incorporate the transmission of Aristotelian intelligible forms into\nthis account, so the problem of intelligibility returns. In the\nSecond Meditation, Descartes exposes this gap between what the senses\nreceive and what the mind knows and understands. Considering a\npiece of wax, which presents itself to us as a contingent set of actual\nand possible sensory images, he asks how we come to understand it in\nthe way scientists must \u2013 as an inherently colorless, odorless,\npersistent object with an underlying nature that is subject to\nmathematical laws? The answer, for Descartes, is that we all have\nan abstract, non-sensory idea of a physical object.\nSense-perception makes it possible for us to \u2018fill out\u2019\nthis abstract idea with the contingent details of our actual\nsituation. But intelligibility, our most general\nunderstanding of the world \u2013 of physical objects, of\nspace, of causality, of God, and so on \u2013 is grounded in these\nabstract ideas. But where do these general abstract ideas come\nfrom, given the \u2018poverty\u2019 of sense? Nativism now\nseems an attractive answer. We must come into the world\npre-loaded with the categories (concepts, principles, general ideas,\netc) that will enable us to make sense of what we actually see, hear,\netc. Reason can mine this innate endowment to arrive at an\napriori understanding of things.\n\n\nOne can see the concept of innateness at work behind the scenes in\nDescartes\u2019 wax argument, but that passage is designed more to\nrid us of the idea that our deepest understanding of things comes from\nthe senses than to defend innateness. It is in working out the\nimplications of the wax discussion that we arrive at an innate\nabstract concept of spatial extension. Innateness is also at work, but\nagain behind the scenes, in the central argument of the Meditations\nthat takes us from the fact that we have an idea of God to the\nexistence of God outside the mind. This (innate) idea of an infinite\nbeing (God\u2019s \u2018signature\u2019 in us his creatures, as\nDescartes has it) is what makes it possible for us to know that there\nis a world beyond our thoughts and that our thoughts are not\nsystematically mistaken. But in the discussion in Meditation III,\nDescartes again does not feature the concept of innateness \u2013 when\nand how we\u2019ve come by our idea of God is less to the point than\nthat we have it and could not have constructed it from our thoughts\nabout our own mind. What\u2019s more, that argument takes as a given\na causal principle to the effect that the cause of an idea must have\nat least as great a \u2018degree of formal reality\u2019 (read: reality)\nas the \u2018objective reality\u2019 (read: the degree of reality of the\nobject/content) of the idea.  The principle is arcane, and it\u2019s hard\nto imagine how Descartes could have explained its availability to the\nMeditator except by claiming that it rests on a clear and distinct\ninsight into the nature of causality, which would presumably have to\nbe given innately.  In both these arguments, as in most of his main\nworks, Descartes does not address the concept of innateness head-on\n(the outburst in his Notes Directed Against a Certain Program, which\nincludes a defense of the radical view that\nall our ideas are innate, is the most notable\nexception). Part of the problem might be that it is not easy to\nintegrate the claim that there are innate ideas or principles with\nDescartes\u2019 identification of mind and consciousness. What\nis innate is in the mind prior to experience. He suggests at one\npoint that ideas may be in the mind innately in the way that gout may\nrun in a family. To the extent that this is read as a propensity\ntheory, it will come in for heavy criticism in the Empiricist attack on\ninnateness.\n\n\nLeibniz, the other important Rationalist defender of innateness,\nelaborates the theory in a number of important ways in his New Essays\non Human Understanding. He famously challenges Locke\u2019s\nanalogy of the mind as blank slate with a competing image of the mind\nas a block of marble whose veins already mark out the shape of Hercules\n(52). A more significant point is his sharpening of the poverty\nof the stimulus claim. He argues that our experience of the world\nis always of contingent particulars, but our knowledge can be general,\nand sometimes necessary (50). Going back to the Meno example, the\nslave can see that the squares Socrates has scratched out in the dirt\nstand in a certain relation, but he ends up knowing that such a\nconnection must hold of any possible set of squares that meets\nSocrates\u2019 initial description; that it holds \u2013 to use a phrase\nLeibniz introduced \u2013 in all possible worlds. Leibniz\nargues that rationality must involve more than induction from\ncontingent experience. It must ultimately rely on innate ideas\nand principles that allow us to grasp not just how things\nhappen to be, but also why they must be that\nway.\n\n\nLeibniz also addresses the question of how the innateness doctrine\nneeds to be integrated into a broader epistemology and theory of\nmind. Among his most important contributions in this area: (i)\nthe defense of unconscious mental states (53), (ii) the suggestion that\nnot all of our innate endowment needs to be realized as (unconscious)\nideas and thoughts, but might instead be\n\u2018procedural\u2019 \u2013 inborn ways of thinking and reasoning\n(84), (iii) a clear distinction between something\u2019s being innate\nin us and its being known innately, and (iv) the provocative\nidea, also hinted at in Descartes, that our innate endowment is not\nsimply a grab-bag of elements that God thought it would be good for us\nto start out with, but is in some way a systematic reflection of our\nnature \u2013 for example, the fact that we are substances and can\nreflect on our natures somehow provides us with the innate idea of\nsubstance (as Leibniz has it: we are \u201cinnate to\nourselves\u201d (51\u20132)). Leibniz, like Plato, saw the innateness\nissue as being the most important point of disagreement\nbetween himself and Locke, and perhaps as the central issue in\nphilosophy. He suspected that Locke\u2019s anti-Nativism was an\nindirect attack on the immaterial soul and therefore a challenge to the\nidea of the afterlife and immortality, and therefore a challenge to\nreligion, to ethics, and to public order.\n\n\nFinally, we note that there are really two distinct but related\nLeibnizian philosophies. The foregoing represents Leibniz\u2019s\nattempt to \u2018mainstream\u2019 his thought and contribute to the\nbroader 17th century controversy over science, epistemology,\nand innateness. But there is another Leibniz that we find in his\nmore speculative, more Empedoclean, metaphysical writings, particularly\nthe Monadology. Leibniz\u2019 goal there is presciently like the\nwork of contemporary string theorists \u2013 i.e., to look\nbehind the scientific picture and lay out the still-deeper\nontological and metaphysical nature of reality. The relevant\npoint for us is that the ultimate simple elements in this\nsystem \u2013 the individual \u2018monads\u2019 \u2013 contain\nrepresentations of the world beyond themselves, but these\nrepresentations are not caused by the world. For Leibniz,\nworld-to-mind causality is only an appearance. The reality is\nthat each monad contains, as part of its essential nature, a preloaded\nset of representations of the world. The sequential\n\u2018unfolding\u2019 or \u2018playing out\u2019 of these\nrepresentations can be thought of, in the case of minds, as a stream of\nconsciousness. But the monads do not interact; instead, the\nstreams are coordinated by a pre-established divine harmony\n(Leibniz\u2019s analogy is a pair of synchronized clocks). The\nupshot of all this is that we arrive (again) at the radical conclusion\nthat all thought and experience is innate. There can be\nno external origin for a mental element in Leibniz\u2019s\nmonadology, and the same can be said for the metaphysics of Spinoza,\nthe third of the great Rationalists.\n\n\nThe three Nativist thinkers we have so-far discussed also happen to\nbe Rationalists; that is, they all hold that Reason allows us to go\nbeyond experience and to arrive at a more profound grasp of the\nworld. There is a natural affinity between Nativism and\nRationalism, but it needs to be stressed that despite the tendency to\nidentify the two, they are different. Nativism is about the\ninitial conditions of our mental life. Rationalism is about the\ncharacter of what we can know. Nativism is a supporting element\nin these larger Rationalist philosophies. But this raises a\nquestion that perceptive critics of 17th century Rationalism\nasked \u2013 viz., even if it were granted that there are\ninnate concepts and principles, how can they support Rationalism unless\nwe know independently that they are correct? Otherwise, we have\nno warrant to hold that these innate materials reveal the ultimate\nnature of the world (let alone all possible worlds). It is\ntempting to think that the 17th century response would be to\nadd the premise that such innate ideas and principles are God-given,\nand God would not deceive us. But this reply is inadequate.\nFirst, it is hard to avoid the charge of circularity, but second, it is\nalso dogmatic about God\u2019s plans. How do we know, as one\ncritic put it, that the (purported) innate materials we start with are\nnot meant to be burnt away by experience, in the manner of the natural\nwild growth of soil before it is cultivated?\n\n\nAs it happens, the Rationalist can resist the temptation to invoke\nGod, and avoid the dead-end to which it leads. For Descartes, the\npresence in us of innate materials is of course a contingent fact, but\nthe warrant for the deeper truths we derive from what is\ninnate does not involve any premises about their origin. It is\nbecause we have innate ideas that we can think of mind and extension in\nthe abstract way we do. But the principle that matter\n(extension) cannot think is an a priori truth (according to\nDescartes) because we see clearly and distinctly that it is\nholds. Clarity-and-distinctness as a criterion of truth raises\nits own difficulties, but the difficulties are not the obvious and\ndevastating ones raised above. Once we disentangle Nativism from\nRationalism, we can look back and identify the non-Nativist Rationalist\nelements in Aristotle, and see Rationalist elements in the Empiricist\nand arch anti-Nativist Locke. Both present us with forms of\nRationalism without Nativism. By the same light, contemporary\nnativists inspired by Chomsky\u2019s Linguistic Nativism are\nemphatically \nanti-Rationalist.[6]\n",
