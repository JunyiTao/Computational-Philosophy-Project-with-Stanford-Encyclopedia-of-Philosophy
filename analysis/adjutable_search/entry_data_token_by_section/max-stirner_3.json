    "main_text": "The Ego and Its Own || The Egoistic Future\n2.3 The Egoistic Future\n\nPart Two of The Ego and Its Own is forward-looking and\npositive. It is forward-looking in that it is concerned with the\negoistic future rather than with the ancient or modern worlds. And it\nis positive in that it aims to establish the possibility that\nStirner\u2019s contemporaries can be liberated from the tyranny of\nreligion.\n\nStirner\u2019s account of the developing historical relationship\nbetween the individual and society is advanced in a series of\nparallels which are designed to portray egoism as the embodiment of a\nmore advanced civilisation. At one point, he takes the early modern\nidea of a social contract, in which progress traditionally consists of\na move from an atomistic state of nature to a communal civil society,\nand neatly inverts it. It is membership of society, and not individual\nisolation, Stirner suggests, which is humankind\u2019s \u201cstate\nof nature\u201d (271); that is, an early and problematic stage of\ndevelopment whose inadequacies are, in due course, outgrown.\nElsewhere, he describes the developing relationship between the\nindividual and society as analogous to that between a mother and her\nchild. As the individual (the child) develops a mature preference for\na less suffocating environment, they must throw off the claims of\nsociety (the mother) which seeks to maintain them in a subordinate\nposition. In both cases, Stirner draws the lesson that the individual\nmust move from social to egoistic relationships in order to escape\nsubjection.\n\nWhat is meant by \u201cegoism\u201d, however, is not always clear.\nStirner is occasionally portrayed as a psychological egoist, that is,\nas a proponent of the descriptive claim that all (intentional) actions\nare motivated by a concern for the self-interest of the agent.\nHowever, this characterisation of Stirner\u2019s position can be\nquestioned. Not least, The Ego and Its Own is structured\naround the opposition between egoistic and non-egoistic modes of\nexperience. Indeed, he appears to hold that non-egoistic modes of\nexperience have predominated historically (in the epochs of realism\nand idealism). Moreover, at one point, Stirner appears explicitly to\nconsider adopting the explanatory stance of psychological egoism only\nto reject it. In a discussion of a young woman who sacrifices her love\nfor another in order to respect the wishes of her family, Stirner\nremarks that an observer might be tempted to maintain that selfishness\nhas still prevailed in this case since the woman clearly preferred the\nwishes of her family to the attractions of her suitor. However,\nStirner rejects this hypothetical explanation, insisting that,\nprovided \u201cthe pliable girl were conscious of having left her\nself-will unsatisfied and humbly subjected herself to a higher\npower\u201d (197), we should see her actions as governed by piety\nrather than egoism.\n\nIt would also be a mistake to think of Stirner as advocating a\nnormative proposition about the value of self-interested action as\nordinarily understood. Stirnerian egoism needs to be distinguished\nfrom an individual\u2019s pursuit of conventional self-interest. In\nThe Ego and Its Own, Stirner discusses the important example\nof an avaricious individual who sacrifices everything in pursuit of\nmaterial riches. Such an individual is clearly conventionally\nself-interested (they act only to enrich themselves) but it is an\negoism which Stirner rejects as one-sided and narrow. Stirner\u2019s\nreason for rejecting this form of egoism is instructive. He suggests\nthat the avaricious individual has become enslaved to a single end,\nand that enslavement is incompatible with egoism properly\nunderstood.\n\nStirnerian egoism is then perhaps best thought of, not in terms of the\npursuit of conventional self-interest, but rather as a variety of\nindividual self-rule or autonomy. Egoism properly understood is to be\nidentified with what Stirner calls \u201cownness\n[Eigenheit]\u201d, a type of autonomy which is incompatible\nwith any suspension, whether voluntary or forced, of individual\njudgement. \u201cI am my own\u201d, Stirner writes, \u201conly when\nI am master of myself, instead of being mastered \u2026 by anything\nelse\u201d (153). As previously noted, this Stirnerian ideal of\nself-rule has external and internal dimensions, requiring not only\nthat we avoid subordinating ourselves (externally) to others, but also\nthat we escape (internally) being \u201cdragged along\u201d (56) by\nour own appetites. In short, Stirner not only rejects the legitimacy\nof any subordination to the will of another but also recommends that\nindividuals cultivate an ideal of emotional detachment towards their\nown appetites and projects.\n\nJudged against this account of egoism, characterisations of Stirner as\na \u201cnihilist\u201d\u2014in the sense that he rejects all\nnormative judgement\u2014would also appear to be mistaken. The\npopular but doubtful description of Stirner as a\n\u201cnihilist\u201d is encouraged by his explicit rejection of\nmorality. Morality, on Stirner\u2019s account, involves the positing\nof obligations to behave in certain fixed ways towards others. As a\nresult, he rejects morality as incompatible with egoism properly\nunderstood. However, this rejection of morality is not grounded in the\nrejection of values as such, but in the affirmation of what might be\ncalled the non-moral good of autonomy. That is, Stirner allows that\nthere are actions and desires which, although not moral in his sense\n(because they do not involve obligations to others), are nonetheless\nto be assessed positively. Stirner is clearly committed to the\nnon-nihilistic view that certain kinds of character and modes of\nbehaviour (namely autonomous individuals and actions) are to be valued\nabove all others. His conception of morality is, in this respect, a\nnarrow one, and his rejection of the legitimacy of moral claims is not\nto be confused with a denial of the propriety of all normative or\nethical judgement. There is, as a result, no inconsistency in\nStirner\u2019s frequent use of an explicitly evaluative vocabulary,\nas when, for example, he praises the egoist for having the\n\u201ccourage\u201d (265) to lie, or condemns the\n\u201cweakness\u201d (197) of the individual who succumbs to\npressure from their family.\n\nTwo features of Stirner\u2019s position emerge as fundamental. First,\nhe values \u201cownness\u201d not as one good amongst many, but as\nthe most important good, a good which trumps all others. Second, he\nadopts an account of self-rule which is incompatible with the\nexistence of any legitimate obligations to others, even those which an\nindividual has voluntarily undertaken; thereby rejecting perhaps the\nmost familiar (contractual) way of reconciling individual autonomy\nwith the existence of binding obligations. In short, Stirner appears\nto value individual self-rule above all else, and he interprets that\nindividual self-rule in a stringent and idiosyncratic manner.\n",
