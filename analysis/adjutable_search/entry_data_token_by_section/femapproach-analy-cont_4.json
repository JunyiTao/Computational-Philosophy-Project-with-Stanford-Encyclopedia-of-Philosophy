    "main_text": "Freedom and Domination || The Analytic Tradition\n2.1 The Analytic Tradition\n\nWorking from an Anglo-American liberal tradition, Martha Nussbaum\nraises questions similar to those that Allen, Benhabib, Fraser and\nWeir raise about a post-structuralist feminism. Indeed, she thinks the\nlatter is irretrievably self-involved and needs to be rejected in\nfavor of the kind of theoretical and practical work that can end\noppressive practices and institutions (1999a). Her own starting point\nis what she calls the \u201ccapabilities approach,\u201d an approach\nthat is rooted in \u201crespect for the dignity of persons as\nchoosers\u201d (2000, 71\u20132) and that asks what individuals\nwithin a given society are able to do and to be \u2013 what their\ncapabilities or freedoms are. Following John Rawls here Nussbaum\nfocuses on the distribution of resources and opportunities within a\ncountry or political entity. Like Amartya Sen, she adds to\nRawls\u2019 view, first, the question of what individuals\u2019\nneeds for resources are and, second, the question of how they are able\nto convert these resources into human functionings (1999, 34). By\nhuman functionings, Nussbaum means the realization of one or more\ncapability \u2013 the enjoyment of good health, for example. She is\ninterested in both the basic functionings, without which we would not\nregard a life as human or fully human, and the less basic\nfunctionings, without which we would not regard a human life as\nflourishing.\n\nThe \u201cwe\u201d here is not meant to be ethnocentric. The claim\nis, rather, that a just society provides individuals with capabilities\nfor human functionings where the idea of the important capabilities\nis one to which people from different traditions with different\nconceptions of the good could agree as necessary to the pursuit of\ntheir particular conception. This idea provides a checklist of\ncapabilities against which to measure forms of oppression and\ndiscrimination in particular countries. Thus, inequalities based on\ngender hierarchies as well as practices such as female genital\nmutilation will be precluded and a defense of such practices as part\nof the cultural tradition will not work. If cultural tradition\nconfines women to the house, even if widowed and without means of\nsupport, then such practices are to be condemned as violating\ncapabilities for even basic functioning. Indeed, while practices such\nas female genital mutilation and female confinement violate\ncapabilities for life, nutrition and bodily integrity, all\ninequalities based on gender hierarchies, in Nussbaum\u2019s view,\nundermine capabilities for self-respect and emotional development that\nare part of human functioning. Ultimately, Nussbaum\u2019s concerns\nare the same as Fraser\u2019s: that a focus on genealogy and\nresignification cannot do the work of undoing the social, political\nand economic discrimination that women suffer in far too many cultures\nand countries and that it is this discrimination that feminism must\ntry to combat.\n\nOther feminists have concerns about Nussbaum\u2019s approach,\nhowever. Susan Moller Okin objects to the narrative approach that\nNussbaum introduces in Women and Human Development insofar as\nit relies on retelling the experiences of two poor Indian women,\nVasanti and Jayamma. Okin points out that despite the sort of\ncross-cultural dialogue in which Nussbaum thinks feminists should\nengage (Nussbaum 2000, 7), she rarely quotes these women directly and\nrefracts their views through her own (Okin 2003, 295). From where,\nthen, does Nussbaum\u2019s checklist of capabilities come? Okin calls\nher idea of a fully human life \u201chighly intellectualized\u201d\nand maintains that the capacities central to it \u201cseem to derive\nfar more from an Aristotelian ideal than from any deep or broad\nfamiliarity with the lives of women in the less developed world\u201d\n(2003, 296). Likewise, while Alison Jaggar thinks the narrative\napproach may be anodyne as long as it is meant simply heuristically,\nshe argues that there is little evidence that Nussbaum\u2019s list of\ncapabilities reflects anything like a consensus or even overlapping\nconsensus of \u201cpeople across the world who are reasonably\nwell-informed and uncoerced\u201d (2006, 313). Rather, in spite of a\nlong list of interlocutors, Jagger thinks Nussbaum pays insufficient\nattention to questions of inclusiveness and representation.\n",
