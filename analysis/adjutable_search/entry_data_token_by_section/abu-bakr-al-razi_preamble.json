    "main_text": "\n\nAb\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b (865\u2013925 CE, 251\u2013313 AH)\nwas one of the greatest figures in the history of medicine in the\nIslamic tradition, and one of its most controversial philosophers.\nWhile we have ample surviving evidence for his medical thought, his\nphilosophical ideas mostly have to be pieced together on the basis of\nreports found in other authors, who are often hostile to him. This\nconcerns especially his notorious critique of religion, and his\nteaching that the cosmos is produced through the interaction of five\n\u201ceternal principles\u201d, namely God, Soul, matter, time, and\nplace. We do however have direct access to one branch of his\nphilosophy, namely ethics, represented by a work of advice called\nThe Spiritual Medicine and a briefer rejoinder to his\ncritics, The Philosophical Way of Life. (Note that Ab\u016b\nBakr is not to be confused with other philosophers from the same city\nof Rayy, who are also called al-R\u0101z\u012b: the most famous of\nthese is Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b, who wrote several\ncenturies later.)\n",
