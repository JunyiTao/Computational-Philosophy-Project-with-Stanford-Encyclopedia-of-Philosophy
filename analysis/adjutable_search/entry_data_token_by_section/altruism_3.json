Suppose A has borrowed a book\nfrom B and has promised to return it within a week. When\nA returns the book by the deadline, his motive might be\ndescribed as moral: he has freely made a promise, and he takes himself\nto have an obligation to keep such promises. His motive is simply to\nkeep his word; this is not an example of altruism. But if A\ngives B a book as a gift, thinking that B will enjoy it\nand find it useful, he is acting simply out of a desire to benefit\nB. His motive in this case is altruistic. \n\nSimilarly, suppose a mother refrains from giving her adult son advice\nabout a certain matter because she thinks that it is not her place to\ndo so\u2014it would be interfering too much in his private affairs.\nEven so, she might also think that he would benefit from receiving her\nadvice; she respects his autonomy but fears that as a result he will\ndecide badly. Her restraint is morally motivated, but it would not\nnormally be described as an act of altruism.\n\nAs these examples indicate, the notion of altruism is applicable not\nto every morally motivated treatment of others, but more narrowly to\nwhat is done out of a concern for the good of others\u2014in other\nwords, for their well-being. Altruistic acts might be described as\ncharitable or benevolent or kind, for these words also convey the idea\nof acting for the good of others, and not merely rightly towards\nothers.\n\nOften the individuals who are the \u201ctargets\u201d of altruistic\nbehavior are selected for such treatment because of a personal tie\nbetween the benefactor and the beneficiary. If A was\nextraordinarily kind to B when B was a child, and at a\nlater time B is in a position to help A out of a\ndifficult situation, the help B gives to A is\naltruistically motivated, even though their common past explains why\nit is A that B has chosen to help (rather than a\nstranger in need). Here it is assumed that B is not promoting\nA\u2019s well-being as a mere means to his own\n(B\u2019s) own well-being. If that were so, B would not\nbe benefiting A for A\u2019s sake, but only for\nB\u2019s sake. (A further assumption is that B is not\nmotivated simply by a sense that he owes repayment to A;\nrather, he not only feels indebted to A but also genuinely\ncares about him.) The people whom we treat altruistically are often\nthose to whom we have a sentimental attachment, or towards whom we\nfeel grateful. But that is not the only possibility. Some altruistic\nacts are motivated simply by a recognition of the great need of those\nwho benefit from them, and the benefactor and beneficiary may be\nstrangers to each other. \n\nThat an act is altruistically motivated does not entail that it is\njustified or praiseworthy. A may mistakenly think that\nshe is enhancing the well-being of B; B might also\nmistakenly think that she is benefiting from A\u2019s\nefforts. We could say that in such cases there is something admirable\nabout A\u2019s motive, but nonetheless judge that she ought not\nto have acted as she did.\n",
