    "main_text": "The Philosophical System of the Periphyseon || Human Nature\n4. Influence\n\nEriugena\u2019s Periphyseon had immediate influence in\nFrance, notably at the schools of Laon, Auxerre, and Corbie. His\ntranslations of Pseudo-Dionysius were widely used from the time of\nAnastasius until they were gradually replaced in the thirteenth\ncentury by those of Johannes Sarracenus. His Homily on the\nPrologue to John (albeit often attributed to Origen) circulated\nwidely through the Middle Ages. The Periphyseon became\nparticularly popular in the twelfth century, especially when\ncirculated in the \u201cedition\u201d of William of Malmsebury or in\nthe paraphrase by Honorius Augustodunensis known as Clavis\nphysicae. Hugh of Saint Victor, Alanus of Lille, and Suger of\nSaint-Denis were among those influenced by Eriugena. In the thirteenth\ncentury, however, the Periphyseon was linked with the\nwritings of David of Dinant and Amaury of B\u00e8ne, two theologians\nat the University of Paris, and was condemned with them in 1210 and\n1225. According to Thomas Aquinas (ST I.3.8; SCG I.17; I.26), Amaury\nof B\u00e8ne was condemned for saying that God is the formal principle of\nall things, an accusation of pantheism, which recalled\nEriugena\u2019s statement that God is the \u201cform of all\nthings\u201d (forma omnium). David of Dinant (fl.\n1210), on the other hand, was supposed to have identified God with\nprime matter and proclaimed that God was the materia omnium.\nIt is likely that Eriugena\u2019s discussion of God and matter as\n\u201cnothing\u201d, and as both transcending sense and intellect\naccording to the first mode of being and non-being, contributed to\nthis accusation.\n\nIn the later Middle Ages both Meister Eckhart of Hochheim\n(c.1260\u2013c.1328) and Nicholas of Cusa (1401\u201364) were\nsympathetic to Eriugena and familiar with his Periphyseon.\nCusanus owned a copy of the Periphyseon. Interest in Eriugena\nwas revived by Thomas Gale\u2019s first printed edition of 1687.\nHowever, soon afterwards, Thomas Gale\u2019s first printed edition,\nthe Periphyseon, was listed in the first edition of the\nIndex Librorum Prohibitorum, and remained on it, until the\nIndex itself was abolished in the 1960s. In the nineteenth century,\nHegel and his followers, interested in the history of philosophy from\na systematic point of view, read Eriugena rather uncritically as an\nabsolute idealist and as the father of German idealism. The first\ncritical editions of his major works were not produced until the\ntwentieth century (Lutz, Jeauneau, Barbet). A conference organized by\nJohn O\u2019Meara and Ludwig Bieler in the Royal Irish Academy,\nDublin, in 1970 led to the founding of the Society for the Promotion\nof Eriugenian Studies (SPES) which has been active in developing\nEriugena studies at a high scholarly level by hosting international\ncolloquia and publishing the proceedings. The most recent meeting of\nSPES, \u201cEriugena and Creation\u201d took place at the University\nof Chicago in 2011 (Otten &Allen 2014).\n\nEriugena is an original philosopher who articulates the relation\nbetween God and creation in a manner which preserves both divine\ntranscendence and omnipresence. His theory of human nature is\nrationalist and intellectualist but also apophatic. His theory of\nplace and time as defining structures of the mind anticipates Kant,\nhis dialectical reasoning prefigures Hegel. But above all, Eriugena is\na mystic who emphasizes the ultimate unity of human nature and through it of the entire creation with God.\n",
