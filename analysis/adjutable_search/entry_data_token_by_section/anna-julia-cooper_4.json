Other Select Essays and Writings: Ruminations Beyond Voice\nThe Ethics of the Negro Question\n\n\nIn \u201cThe Ethics of the Negro Question\u201d (1902) Cooper\nconfronts the hypocrisy of Christianity in America. According to\nCooper, the Negro \u201cstands in the United States of America today\nas the passive and silent rebuke to the Nation\u2019s Christianity, the\ngreat gulf between its professions and its practices, furnishing the\nchief ethical element in its politics, \u2026[and pointing the\nfinger at so-called] ideals of civilization\u201d (VAJC, 206). This\nsentiment is reiterated in \u201cThe Negro in American\nLiterature\u201d where Cooper asserts that the color caste in this\ncountry is a \u201cscathing rebuke to weak-eyed Christians who cannot\nread the golden rule across the color line\u201d (VAJC, 145).\n Cooper recounts the harsh circumstances under which the Negro is\nuprooted and transplanted to this \u201cChristian\u201d nation,\nreduced to chattel and beasts of burden for the purpose of producing\nwealth for white men and the economy of the nation (VAJC, 207).  Like\nFrederick Douglass and others, Cooper underscores this\nnation\u2019s failure to adhere to the declaration that \u201call men are created equal\u201d from the beginning. Her\nuse of language and imagery are worth quoting at length. She\nasserts:\n\n\nProfessing a religion of sublime altruism, a political faith in the\ninalienable rights of man as man, these jugglers with reason and\nconscience were at the same moment stealing heathen from their far\naway homes, forcing them with lash and gun to unrequited toil, making\nit a penal offense to teach them to read the word of God,\u2014nay,\nmore, were even begetting and breeding mongrels of their own flesh\namong these helpless creatures and pocketing the guilty increase, the\nprice of their own blood in unholy dollars and cents.  (VAJC, 207)\n\n \n\nCooper not only highlights the discontinuity between religion,\nfaith, reason, and conscience on the one hand and the atrocities of\nslavery on the other, she also exposes the white male slave owner as a\nrapist who fathers children by Black female slaves and then exploits\nthe labor of those children who must assume the slave status of their\nmothers. This is a constant point of emphasis by Cooper not only\nbecause of its prevalence during and after slavery, but also because\nof her own her lived experience. Added to all of this is the problem\nof lynching\u2014adeptly described by Ida B. Wells-Barnett as \u201cOur\nNational Crime\u201d.\n\u201cMy Racial Philosophy\u201d (Survey Question)\n\n\nCooper wrote \u201cMy Racial Philosophy\u201d (1930) in response to\na survey distributed by Charles S. Johnson to Black college\ngraduates. In 1927 Johnson became chair of a newly formed social\nscience department at Fisk University. Other prominent members of the\ndepartment faculty at that time included now famed social scientists\nRobert E. Park and E. Franklin Frazier. The formation of this\ndepartment at Fisk was made possible by a $200,000 contribution from\nthe Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial\u2014for whom Spelman College,\nthe renowned historically Black college for women in Atlanta, GA is\nalso named (Gasman 1999, 6). By 1930, Johnson was collecting data from\nthis survey taken by Cooper and numerous others, and by 1946 Johnson\nhad become the sixth president, though the first Black president, of\nFisk. \n\n\nThe question to which Cooper was replying in Johnson\u2019s 1930\nsurvey is (question # 65): \u201cHave you a \u2018racial\nphilosophy\u2019 that can be briefly stated?\u201d Cooper begins her\ntwo-page reply by emphasizing the fact that race and gender prejudice\nis often overlapping, particularly for Black women. The analysis\nof race and gender intersectionality dominates Cooper\u2019s\nphilosophy, not only here, but throughout A Voice from the\nSouth. Here she asserts, \u201cthe whips and stings of\nprejudice, whether of color or sex, find me neither too calloused to\nsuffer, nor too ignorant to know what is due me\u201d (VAJC, 236).\n Cooper adds that one would be mistaken to \u201cimagine that\noppression goes only with color\u201d and explains, \u201cWhen I\nencounter brutality I need not always charge it to my\nrace\u201d (VAJC, 236). Even more significant in Cooper\u2019s\nracial philosophy is the correlation she draws between prejudice,\ncivilization, and our responsibility in the formation of our\ncivilization. Cooper claims that the brutality of prejudice is\n\u201cchargeable to the imperfections in the civilization\u2026for\nwhich as a teacher and a trained thinker I take my share in\nresponsibility\u201d (VAJC, 236).\n",
