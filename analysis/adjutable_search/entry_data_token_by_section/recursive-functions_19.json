    "main_text": "Computability Theory || .2 The analytical hierarchy\n4. Further Reading\n\nHistorical surveys of the early development of recursive functions and\ncomputability theory are provided by Sieg (2009), Adams (2011), and\nSoare (2016, part V). Many of the original sources discussed in\n \u00a71\n are anthologized in Davis (1965), Heijenoort (1967), and Ewald\n(1996). Textbook presentation of computability theory at an elementary\nand intermediate level include Hopcroft & Ulman (1979), Cutland\n(1980), Davis, Sigal, & Weyuker (1994), and Murawski (1999). The\noriginal textbook expositions of the material presented in\n \u00a72\n and\n \u00a73\n (up to the formulation of Post\u2019s problem) include Kleene\n(1952), Shoenfield (1967), and Rogers (1987; first edition 1967). The\nstructure of the many-one and Turing Degrees is presented in more\nadvanced textbooks such as Sacks (1963a), Shoenfield (1971), Hinman\n(1978), Soare (1987), Cooper (2004), and Soare (2016). In addition to\nShoenfield (1967, ch. 7) and Rogers (1987, ch. 16), the classic\ntreatment of the hyperarithmetical and analytical hierarchies is Sacks\n(1990). Classical and effective descriptive set theory are developed\nin Y. Moschovakis (2009, first edition 1980) and Kechris (1995).\nSimpson (2009) develops connections between computability theory and\nReverse Mathematics\u2014i.e., the axiomatic study of\nsubsystems of second-order arithmetic whose \u03c9-models may often\nbe characterized using computability theoretic methods. Treatment of\nsub-recursive hierarchies and connections to proof theory and\ntheoretical computer science are provided by P\u00e9ter (1967), Rose\n(1984), Clote (2002, ch. 6\u20137), and Schwichtenberg & Wainer\n(2011). Many of the historical and mathematical topics surveyed in\nthis entry are also presented in greater detail in the two volumes of\nOdifreddi\u2019s Classical Recursion Theory (1989, 1999a),\nwhich contain many additional historical references.\n",
