    "main_text": "John Locke || Locke\u2019s argument for the distinction of P/SQs\n5.1 Locke\u2019s argument for the distinction of P/SQs\n\nAlthough Locke\u2019s Essay Concerning Human Understanding\n(1689\u201390) (hereafter Essay or E, cited by Book,\nChapter, and Section number) contains the canonical distinction, it is\nan inquiry into the origin, limits and sufficiency of human cognition.\nIt is not meant to contribute to theoretical natural philosophy, but\nto expose abuses of language that hamper it (E [1975: 9\u201310]).\nLocke\u2019s attitude toward CT is mixed: he points to its failure to\naccount for the cohesion of the parts of matter and communication of\nmotion (E 2.23.26, 28) but holds it up as the hypothesis that\n\u201cgoes farthest in an intelligible Explanation of the Qualities\nof Bodies\u201d, (E 2.23; 4.3.12\u201313).\n\nThat PQs and SQs are placed in the same category, that of things that\nsubsist in substance, reflects Locke\u2019s interest in what we know\nby means of the senses. For him, substance and quality are inseparble.\nSo if we know that qualities exist, we can rightly infer there is a\nsubstance in which they inhere, and we know qualities exist because we\nreceive ideas of sensation caused by substances. Ideas of sensation\nare one of two sorts of ideas which are the simple elements of all our\nthoughts and can only be acquired in experience according to Locke.\nEssay, book 2, chapter 8, which exposits and defends the\ndistinction of PQs and SQs, comes immediately after five chapters that\ndefine and classify simple ideas. The sixth breaks down the relation\nbetween simple ideas of sensation and qualities in order to show that\nmost of the former do not resemble the later.\n\nThe argument of Essay 2.8 can be divided into seven\nstages.\n\nFirst, sections 1\u20136 urge that privations, e.g., rest and\ndarkness act as causes just as their positive opposites do.\n\nSecond, sections 7\u20138 distinguish qualities and ideas:\n\n\nWhatsoever the Mind perceives in itself, or is the immediate object of\nPerception, Thought, or Understanding, that I call Idea; and\nthe Power to produce any Idea in our mind, I call Quality of\nthe Subject wherein that power is. (E 2.8.8)\n\n\nA snowball has powers to produce ideas of white, cold, and round; the\nmind possesses the ideas. The point is that ideas are intentional and\nontologically distinct from the qualities. Yet Locke says he will\nsometimes speak of ideas as in the subjects but should be understood\nto mean qualities of the subjects that cause the ideas in us. This is\nsaid elsewhere to comply with ordinary ways of speaking (E 2.32.2).\nLocke apparently sees little harm in indulging this once it is\nunderstood that it cannot be correct. This is one of several ordinary\nbut inexact uses of language that play a role in Locke\u2019s theory\nof qualities; on civil and philosophical uses of language, see\nEssay 3.9.3.\n\nThird, sections 9\u201310 introduce the distinction of primary\nqualities, secondary qualities, and a sub-species of the latter. There\nis a criterion by which PQs are selected: inseparability from bodies\nin whatever state they may be\u2014in perception, conception, all\nalterations bodies undergo, and in an imaginary act of repeatedly\ndividing a sensible particle into insensible parts. Secondary\nqualities are characterized as\n\n\nnothing in the Objects themselves, but Powers to produce various\nSensations in us by their primary Qualities, i.e., by the Bulk,\nFigure, Texture and Motion of their insensible parts. (E 2.8.10)\n\n\nThe sub-species includes attributes such as the sun\u2019s power to\nmelt wax and thereby give it the power to cause ideas of warmth.\nAccording to Locke, these attributes are commonly regarded as powers\nbut are \u201cas much real Qualities in the Subject, as those which I\nto comply with the common way of speaking, call Qualities,\nbut for distinction, secondary Qualities,\u201d (E 2.8.10; E\n2.31.2) Recall that Boyle uses the traditional term \u201csensible\nqualties\u201d to signify warmth, color, etc. So SQs are designated\nby the term \u201cquality\u201d but are wrongly supposed to be\nqualities. More on this in stage seven.\n\nFourth, sections 12\u201314 declare it is \u201cmanifestly by\nimpulse\u201d that ideas are caused in minds (E 2.8.11). A\nlittle reflection is taken to show that when we perceive a body,\nmotions of insensible particles convey motions to parts of our bodies\nthat ultimately result in sensory ideas. If it is true that bodies\nacton our sense only by impulse, this is a reason to accept the\ncharacterization of SQs in Essay 2.8.10.\n\nFifth, sections 15\u201321 state and defend what is commonly called\nthe \u201cResemblance Thesis\u201d (hereafter \u201cRT\u201d). It\nhas a positive and a negative part: ideas of primary qualities\nresemble features of the bodies that cause them\u2014\u201ctheir\nPatterns do really exist in the Bodies themselves\u201d\u2014but\n\u201cthere is nothing like the ideas [of SQs] in the bodies\nthemselves\u201d (E 2.8.15). This is presented as an evident\nconsequence of the claims in sections 8 through 14. The sections that\nfollow argue directly for the positive and negative assertions.\n\nThe negative claim is supported by at least two lines of thought. The\nfirst ascribes the common belief in the resemblance of SQs and their\nideas to a misguided metaphysical theory implicit in a common way of\nspeaking: \u201cFlame is denominated Hot and Light\n\u2026 from the ideas [it produces] in us\u201d (E 2.8.16). But,\nLocke argues, fire causes ideas of both heat and pain and we have no\nmore reason to think heat resembles something in the fire than that\npain does (E 2.8.16). Many scholars take the remark about use of\nlanguage to say we give the same names to sensations and the qualities\nthat cause them (e.g., Ayers 1991: 63\u20134), but although this\nmight account for the assumption that ideas are in substances, which\nLocke indulges, it hardly explains belief in idea-quality resemblance.\nJacovides (2007b) convincingly argues that the usage to which Locke\nrefers is paronymous, i.e., the name of one thing is given to\nsomething which has a certain relation to the one but with a change of\nending. Locke speaks of the names of general ideas of kinds of things\nin this way; e.g., we are denominated \u201chuman\u201d from the\nabstract idea, humanity (E 3.8.1). In Essay 2.8, ideas\nproduced by SQs are almost always given names of abstract ideas:\n\u201csweetness\u201d, \u201cwarmth\u201d, etc. Jacovides suggests\nLocke\u2019s point is that the paronymous use of names of ideas of\nSQs may convey that there is something in objects that gives them\ntheir colors, etc. The second argument against resemblance questions\nwhy warmth, etc. is supposed to resemble something in bodies but pain\nis not (E 2.8.16).\n\nIn support of the positive resemblance between PQs and ideas of them,\nLocke appeals to practical action: it is by being moved from\nA to B that a body causes the idea of its motion\nfrom A to B. so the idea represents motion \u201cas\nit really is\u201d in the body (E 2.8.18); \u201cA Circle or Square\nare the same whether in Idea or Existence.\u201d (E 2.8.18)\nQuick as this argument is, it is taken to show that motion and figure\n\u201care really in bodies whether we take notice of them or\nno.\u201d (E 2.8.18) The following sections 19 through 21 propose\nthought experiments regarding the color of porphyry in the presence\nand absence of light, the taste of an almond before and after a\npounding, and a bowl of water in which one person has placed both\nhands one of which has been in ice water and the other in hot water.\nCurley (1972) decisively argues that none of this is meant to show\nthat appearances of SQs\u2014unlike PQs\u2014are perceiver relative\nunreliable bases on which to judge the properties of things we\nperceive. But scholars have had difficulty seeing what the examples\nare intended to show: whether to substantiate the resemblance thesis,\nthe corpuscular theory, or the reality of qualities and non reality of\npowers. For different views, see, e.g., Alexander (1985:\n124\u201329), Atherton (1992), Lowe (2005: 51\u20132), Rickless\n(2014: 88\u201393), McCann (2011: 175\u20136). Robert Wilson (2004:\n204\u201306); on the color of porphyry, Stuart (2003) and Jacovides\n(2007b: 641\u20132).\n\nSeventh, sections 22\u20136 stress that PQs are real qualities\nwhereas SQs are imputed qualities. Two things are said to mark PQs as\nreal:\n\nmind-independence: PQs are in bodies whether they are perceived or\nnot (E 2.8.23); bodies would have them if there were no sensible\nbeings (E 2.31.2) and\nthe dependence of SQs on PQs of insensible particles (E\n2.8.23).\n\n\nThe vast secondary literature on this doctrine raises a large number\nof debatable questions. The following issues are considered here\nbecause they are particularly important for understanding what is\ndistinctive about Locke\u2019s version of the P/SQ distinction:\n\nWhether SQs are a sort of quality or a sort of power\nThe epistemic basis of the criteria of PQs\nThe metaphysical status of SQs\nWhat it is for the idea of a PQ to resemble a PQ of a body\naccording to Locke.\n\n",
