Revisions (1966\u201378)\n\nFrom the time of its initial dissemination, Althusser\u2019s\nre-reading of Marx was met by almost equal amounts of enthusiasm and\ncastigation. For every reader who found in his prose an explanation of\nMarx\u2019s philosophy and science that rendered Marx philosophically\nrespectable and offered renewed hope for Marxist theory, there were\ncritics who judged his work to be idealist, Stalinist, dogmatist, or\nexcessively structuralist, among myriad other charges. Though many of\nthe initial reactions were contradictory and evidenced\nmisunderstandings of what Althusser was up to, compelling criticisms\nwere also offered. One was that Althusser was only able to offer his\nreading by ignoring much of what Marx actually wrote about his logic\nand about the concepts important to his analysis. Another criticism,\nand one voiced to Althusser by leaders of the French Communist Party,\nwas that Althusser\u2019s reading of Marx offered little on the\nrelationship between Marxist theory and Marxist political\npractice.\n\nIt took a long time before Althusser explicitly addressed the charge\nthat he had ignored much of what Marx had to say about his own logic\nand concepts. However, buffeted by these criticisms and with a sense\nthat there were idealist or \u201ctheoreticist\u201d tendencies in\nhis reading of Marx and that the relationship between theory and\npractice was indeed under-developed, Althusser set out during the late\n1960s and 1970s to correct and revise his take on the relationships\namong philosophy, science, ideology, and politics. To some readers,\nthese revisions represented a politically motivated betrayal of his\ntheoretical accomplishments. For others, they simply revealed his\nproject as a whole to be untenable and self-contradictory. Some recent\ncritics, however, have argued that these revisions are consistent with\nand necessary to the development of what they view to be the overall\ngoal of Althusser\u2019s work: the development of a materialist\npolitical philosophy adequate for political practice.\n",
