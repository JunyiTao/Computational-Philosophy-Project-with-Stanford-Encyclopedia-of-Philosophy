    "main_text": "The History of the Historical Challenge || Boltzmann Against Historical Pessimism\n1.4 Boltzmann Against Historical Pessimism\n\nThis relational answer to historical pessimism was motivated, at least\npartly, by the widespread scepticism towards the atomic theory of\nmatter. Atomism posited the existence of unobservable\nentities\u2014the atoms\u2014to account for a host of observable\nphenomena (from chemical bonding to Brownian motion). A trend among\nscientists opposed to the explanation of the visible in terms of the\ninvisible was what Ludwig Boltzmann called\n\u201cphenomenologists\u201d (which included the early Max Planck),\naccording to whom the aim of science was to \u201cwrite down for\nevery group of phenomena the equations by means of which their\nbehavior could be quantitatively calculated\u201d (Boltzmann 1901:\n249). The theoretical hypotheses from which the equations might have\nbeen deduced were taken to be the scaffolding that was discarded after\nthe equations were arrived at. For phenomenologists, then, hypotheses\nare not unnecessary or useless\u2014rather they have only a\nheuristic value: they lead to stable (differential) equations\nand that\u2019s it.\n\nAccording to Boltzmann, a motivation for this phenomenological\nattitude was the \u201chistorical principle\u201d, viz., that\nhypotheses are essentially insecure because they tend to be abandoned\nand replaced by others, \u201ctotally different\u201d ones. As he\nput it:\n\n\nfrequently opinions which are held in the highest esteem have been\nsupplanted within a very short space of time by totally different\ntheories; nay, even as St. Remigius the heathens, so now they [the\nphenomenologists] exhorted the theoretical physicists to consign to\nthe flames the idols that but a moment previously they had worshipped\n(1901: 252\u2013253).\n\n\nLike Poincar\u00e9, Boltzmann\u2019s answer to historical pessimism\nwas that despite the presence of \u201crevolutions\u201d in science,\nthere is enough continuity in theory change to warrant the claim that\nsome \u201cachievements may possibly remain the possession of science\nfor all time\u201d (1901: 253). But unlike Poincar\u00e9, Boltzmann\ndid not restrict the criterion of invariance-in-theory-change to\nrelations only: The answer to the historical challenge is to look\nfor patterns of continuity in theory change. In fact, as\nBoltzmann noted, if the historical principle is correct at all, it\ncuts also against the equations of the phenomenologists. For unless\nthese very equations remain invariant through theory-change, there\nshould be no warrant for taking them to be accurate descriptions of\nworldly relations (cf. 1901: 253). Besides, Boltzmann noted, the very\nconstruction of the differential equations of the phenomenologists\nrequires commitment to substantive atomistic assumptions. Hence, the\nphenomenologists are not merely disingenuous when they jettison the\natomistic assumptions after the relevant differential equations have\nbeen arrived at. Their move is self-undermining. In light of the\nhistorical principle, the success of the mathematical equations would\nlead to their defeat, since the very theory that led to this success\nwould fall foul of the historical principle: it would have to be\nabandoned.\n\nThe history-based pessimism (and the relevant debate) came to an end\nby the triumph of atomism in the first decade of the twentieth\ncentury. Due to the work of Albert Einstein and the French physicist\nJean Perrin on the atomic explanation of Brownian motion, one after\nthe other of major scientists who were initially sceptical about the\natomic conception of matter came to accept\n atomism.[4]\n The French philosopher Andr\u00e9 Lalande captured this point in\nhis 1913 (pp. 366\u2013367) thus:\n\n\nM. Perrin, professor of physics at the Sorbonne, has described in\nLes Atomes, with his usual lucidity and vigour, the recent\nexperiments (in which he has taken so considerable a part) which prove\nconclusively that the atoms are physical realities and not symbolical\nconceptions as people have for a long time been fond of calling them.\nBy giving precise and concordant measures for their weights and\ndimensions, it is proved that bodies actually exist which, though\ninvisible, are analogous at all points to those which we see and\ntouch. An old philosophical question thus receives a positive\nsolution.\n\n\nBe that as it may, what this brief account of the history of the\nhistorical challenge to realism reveals are the two major lines of\ndefense of realism at play. Both lines of defense are based on the\npresence of substantial continuity in theory-change in the history of\nscience. This continuity suggests that the disruption of the\nscientific image of the world, as theories change, is less radical\nthan is assumed by the historical challenge to realism. But the two\nlines of defense (the Poincar\u00e9-Duhem and the Boltzmann one)\ndisagree over what is retained when theories change. The\nPoincar\u00e9-Duhem line of defense focuses on mathematical\nequations (which express relations) and claims that only relations\namong unobservable things are knowable, whereas the Boltzmann line of\ndefense focuses on whatever theoretical elements (including entities\nlike atoms) are retained while theories change; hence, it does not\nlimit scientific knowledge to the knowledge of relations only. Both\nlines have resurfaced in the current debate.\n",
