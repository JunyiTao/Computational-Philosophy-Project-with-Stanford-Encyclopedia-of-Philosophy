Philosophical and Historical Motivation\n\nGame theory in the form known to economists, social scientists, and\nbiologists, was given its first general mathematical formulation by\nJohn von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern\n (1944).\n For reasons to be discussed later, limitations in their formal\nframework initially made the theory applicable only under special and\nlimited conditions. This situation has dramatically changed, in ways\nwe will examine as we go along, over the past seven decades, as the\nframework has been deepened and generalized. Refinements are still\nbeing made, and we will review a few outstanding problems that lie\nalong the advancing front edge of these developments towards the end\nof the article. However, since at least the late 1970s it has been\npossible to say with confidence that game theory is the most important\nand useful tool in the analyst\u2019s kit whenever she confronts\nsituations in which what counts as one agent\u2019s best action (for\nher) depends on expectations about what one or more other agents will\ndo, and what counts as their best actions (for them) similarly depend\non expectations about her. \n\nDespite the fact that game theory has been rendered mathematically and\nlogically systematic only since 1944, game-theoretic insights can be\nfound among commentators going back to ancient times. For example, in\ntwo of Plato\u2019s texts, the Laches and the\nSymposium, Socrates recalls an episode from the Battle of\nDelium that some commentators have interpreted (probably\nanachronistically) as involving the following situation. Consider a\nsoldier at the front, waiting with his comrades to repulse an enemy\nattack. It may occur to him that if the defense is likely to be\nsuccessful, then it isn\u2019t very probable that his own personal\ncontribution will be essential. But if he stays, he runs the risk of\nbeing killed or wounded\u2014apparently for no point. On the other\nhand, if the enemy is going to win the battle, then his chances of\ndeath or injury are higher still, and now quite clearly to no point,\nsince the line will be overwhelmed anyway. Based on this reasoning, it\nwould appear that the soldier is better off running away regardless of\nwho is going to win the battle. But if all of the soldiers reason this\nway\u2014as they all apparently should, since they\u2019re\nall in identical situations\u2014then this will certainly bring\nabout the outcome in which the battle is lost. Of course, this\npoint, since it has occurred to us as analysts, can occur to the\nsoldiers too. Does this give them a reason for staying at their posts?\nJust the contrary: the greater the soldiers\u2019 fear that the\nbattle will be lost, the greater their incentive to get themselves out\nof harm\u2019s way. And the greater the soldiers\u2019 belief that\nthe battle will be won, without the need of any particular\nindividual\u2019s contributions, the less reason they have to stay\nand fight. If each soldier anticipates this sort of reasoning\non the part of the others, all will quickly reason themselves into a\npanic, and their horrified commander will have a rout on his hands\nbefore the enemy has even engaged.\n\nLong before game theory had come along to show analysts how to think\nabout this sort of problem systematically, it had occurred to some\nactual military leaders and influenced their strategies. Thus the\nSpanish conqueror Cortez, when landing in Mexico with a small force\nwho had good reason to fear their capacity to repel attack from the\nfar more numerous Aztecs, removed the risk that his troops might think\ntheir way into a retreat by burning the ships on which they had\nlanded. With retreat having thus been rendered physically impossible,\nthe Spanish soldiers had no better course of action than to stand and\nfight\u2014and, furthermore, to fight with as much determination as\nthey could muster. Better still, from Cortez\u2019s point of view,\nhis action had a discouraging effect on the motivation of the Aztecs.\nHe took care to burn his ships very visibly, so that the Aztecs would\nbe sure to see what he had done. They then reasoned as follows: Any\ncommander who could be so confident as to willfully destroy his own\noption to be prudent if the battle went badly for him must have good\nreasons for such extreme optimism. It cannot be wise to attack an\nopponent who has a good reason (whatever, exactly, it might be) for\nbeing sure that he can\u2019t lose. The Aztecs therefore retreated\ninto the surrounding hills, and Cortez had the easiest possible\nvictory.\n\nThese two situations, at Delium and as manipulated by Cortez, have a\ncommon and interesting underlying logic. Notice that the soldiers are\nnot motivated to retreat just, or even mainly, by their\nrational assessment of the dangers of battle and by their\nself-interest. Rather, they discover a sound reason to run away by\nrealizing that what it makes sense for them to do depends on what it\nwill make sense for others to do, and that all of the others can\nnotice this too. Even a quite brave soldier may prefer to run rather\nthan heroically, but pointlessly, die trying to stem the oncoming tide\nall by himself. Thus we could imagine, without contradiction, a\ncircumstance in which an army, all of whose members are brave, flees\nat top speed before the enemy makes a move. If the soldiers really\nare brave, then this surely isn\u2019t the outcome any of\nthem wanted; each would have preferred that all stand and fight. What\nwe have here, then, is a case in which the interaction of\nmany individually rational decision-making processes\u2014one process\nper soldier\u2014produces an outcome intended by no one. (Many armies\ntry to avoid this problem just as Cortez did. Since they can\u2019t\nusually make retreat physically impossible, they make it\neconomically irrational: for most of history, it was standard\nmilitary practice to execute deserters. In that context standing and\nfighting is each soldier\u2019s individually rational course of\naction after all, because the expected cost of running is at least as\nhigh as the cost of staying.)\n\nAnother classic source that invites this sequence of reasoning is\nfound in Shakespeare\u2019s Henry V. During the Battle of\nAgincourt Henry decided to slaughter his French prisoners, in full\nview of the enemy and to the surprise of his subordinates, who\ndescribe the action as being out of moral character. The reasons Henry\ngives allude to non-strategic considerations: he is afraid that the\nprisoners may free themselves and threaten his position. However, a\ngame theorist might have furnished him with supplementary strategic\n(and similarly prudential, though perhaps not moral) justification.\nHis own troops observe that the prisoners have been killed, and\nobserve that the enemy has observed this. Therefore, they know what\nfate will await them at the enemy\u2019s hand if they don\u2019t\nwin. Metaphorically, but very effectively, their boats have been\nburnt. The slaughter of the prisoners plausibly sent a signal to the\nsoldiers of both sides, thereby changing their incentives in ways that\nfavoured English prospects for victory.\n\nThese examples might seem to be relevant only for those who find\nthemselves in situations of cut-throat competition. Perhaps, one might\nthink, it is important for generals, politicians, mafiosi, sports\ncoaches and others whose jobs involve strategic manipulation of\nothers, but the philosopher should only deplore its amorality. Such a\nconclusion would be highly premature, however. The study of the\nlogic that governs the interrelationships amongst incentives,\nstrategic interactions and outcomes has been fundamental in modern\npolitical philosophy, since centuries before anyone had an explicit\nname for this sort of logic. Philosophers share with social scientists\nthe need to be able to represent and systematically model not only\nwhat they think people normatively ought to do, but what they\noften actually do in interactive situations.\n\nHobbes\u2019s Leviathan is often regarded as the founding\nwork in modern political philosophy, the text that began the\ncontinuing round of analyses of the function and justification of the\nstate and its restrictions on individual liberties. The core of\nHobbes\u2019s reasoning can be given straightforwardly as follows.\nThe best situation for all people is one in which each is free to do\nas she pleases. (One may or may not agree with this as a matter of\npsychology or ideology, but it is Hobbes\u2019s assumption.) Often,\nsuch free people will wish to cooperate with one another in order to\ncarry out projects that would be impossible for an individual acting\nalone. But if there are any immoral or amoral agents around, they will\nnotice that their interests might at least sometimes be best served by\ngetting the benefits from cooperation and not returning them. Suppose,\nfor example, that you agree to help me build my house in return for my\npromise to help you build yours. After my house is finished, I can\nmake your labour free to me simply by reneging on my promise. I then\nrealize, however, that if this leaves you with no house, you will have\nan incentive to take mine. This will put me in constant fear of you,\nand force me to spend valuable time and resources guarding myself\nagainst you. I can best minimize these costs by striking first and\nkilling you at the first opportunity. Of course, you can anticipate\nall of this reasoning by me, and so have good reason to try to beat me\nto the punch. Since I can anticipate this reasoning by\nyou, my original fear of you was not paranoid; nor was yours\nof me. In fact, neither of us actually needs to be immoral to get this\nchain of mutual reasoning going; we need only think that there is some\npossibility that the other might try to cheat on bargains.\nOnce a small wedge of doubt enters any one mind, the incentive induced\nby fear of the consequences of being preempted\u2014hit\nbefore hitting first\u2014quickly becomes overwhelming on both sides.\nIf either of us has any resources of our own that the other might\nwant, this murderous logic can take hold long before we are so silly\nas to imagine that we could ever actually get as far as making deals\nto help one another build houses in the first place. Left to their own\ndevices, agents who are at least sometimes narrowly self-interested\ncan repeatedly fail to derive the benefits of cooperation, and instead\nbe trapped in a state of \u2018war of all against all\u2019, in\nHobbes\u2019s words. In these circumstances, human life, as he\nvividly and famously put it, will be \u201csolitary, poor, nasty,\nbrutish and short.\u201d\n\nHobbes\u2019s proposed solution to this problem was tyranny. The\npeople can hire an agent\u2014a government\u2014whose job is to\npunish anyone who breaks any promise. So long as the threatened\npunishment is sufficiently dire then the cost of reneging on promises\nwill exceed the cost of keeping them. The logic here is identical to\nthat used by an army when it threatens to shoot deserters. If all\npeople know that these incentives hold for most others, then\ncooperation will not only be possible, but can be the expected norm,\nso that the war of all against all becomes a general peace.\n\nHobbes pushes the logic of this argument to a very strong conclusion,\narguing that it implies not only a government with the right and the\npower to enforce cooperation, but an \u2018undivided\u2019\ngovernment in which the arbitrary will of a single ruler must impose\nabsolute obligation on all. Few contemporary political theorists think\nthat the particular steps by which Hobbes reasons his way to this\nconclusion are both sound and valid. Working through these issues\nhere, however, would carry us away from our topic into details of\ncontractarian political philosophy. What is important in the present\ncontext is that these details, as they are in fact pursued in\ncontemporary debates, involve sophisticated interpretation of the\nissues using the resources of modern game theory (see, for example,\n Hampton 1986).\n Furthermore, Hobbes\u2019s most basic point, that the fundamental\njustification for the coercive authority and practices of governments\nis peoples\u2019 own need to protect themselves from what game\ntheorists call \u2018social dilemmas\u2019, is accepted by many, if\nnot most, political theorists. Notice that Hobbes has not\nargued that tyranny is a desirable thing in itself. The structure of\nhis argument is that the logic of strategic interaction leaves only\ntwo general political outcomes possible: tyranny and anarchy. Sensible\nagents then choose tyranny as the lesser of two evils.\n\nThe reasoning of the Athenian soldiers, of Cortez, and of\nHobbes\u2019s political agents has a common logic, one derived from\ntheir situations. In each case, the aspect of the environment that is\nmost important to the agents\u2019 achievement of their preferred\noutcomes is the set of expectations and possible reactions to their\nstrategies by other agents. The distinction between acting\nparametrically on a passive world and acting\nnon-parametrically on a world that tries to act in\nanticipation of these actions is fundamental. If you want to kick a\nrock down a hill, you need only concern yourself with the rock\u2019s\nmass relative to the force of your blow, the extent to which it is\nbonded with its supporting surface, the slope of the ground on the\nother side of the rock, and the expected impact of the collision on\nyour foot. The values of all of these variables are independent of\nyour plans and intentions, since the rock has no interests of its own\nand takes no actions to attempt to assist or thwart you. By contrast,\nif you wish to kick a person down the hill, then unless that person is\nunconscious, bound or otherwise incapacitated, you will likely not\nsucceed unless you can disguise your plans until it\u2019s too late\nfor him to take either evasive or forestalling action. Furthermore,\nhis probable responses should be expected to visit costs upon you,\nwhich you would be wise to consider. Finally, the relative\nprobabilities of his responses will depend on his expectations about\nyour probable responses to his responses. (Consider the difference it\nwill make to both of your reasoning if one or both of you are armed,\nor one of you is bigger than the other, or one of you is the\nother\u2019s boss.) The logical issues associated with the second\nsort of situation (kicking the person as opposed to the rock) are\ntypically much more complicated, as a simple hypothetical example will\nillustrate.\n\nSuppose first that you wish to cross a river that is spanned by three\nbridges. (Assume that swimming, wading or boating across are\nimpossible.) The first bridge is known to be safe and free of\nobstacles; if you try to cross there, you will succeed. The second\nbridge lies beneath a cliff from which large rocks sometimes fall. The\nthird is inhabited by deadly cobras. Now suppose you wish to\nrank-order the three bridges with respect to their preferability as\ncrossing-points. Unless you get positive enjoyment from risking your\nlife\u2014which, without violating any economist\u2019s conception\nof rationality, you might well (a complication we\u2019ll take up\nlater in this article)\u2014then your decision problem here is\nstraightforward. The first bridge is obviously best, since it is\nsafest. To rank-order the other two bridges, you require information\nabout their relative levels of danger. If you can study the frequency\nof rock-falls and the movements of the cobras for awhile, you might be\nable to calculate that the probability of your being crushed by a rock\nat the second bridge is 10% and of being struck by a cobra at the\nthird bridge is 20%. Your reasoning here is strictly parametric\nbecause neither the rocks nor the cobras are trying to influence your\nactions, by, for example, concealing their typical patterns of\nbehaviour because they know you are studying them. It is obvious what\nyou should do here: cross at the safe bridge. Now let us complicate\nthe situation a bit. Suppose that the bridge with the rocks is\nimmediately before you, while the safe bridge is a day\u2019s\ndifficult hike upstream. Your decision-making situation here is\nslightly more complicated, but it is still strictly parametric. You\nhave to decide whether the cost of the long hike is worth exchanging\nfor the penalty of a 10% chance of being hit by a rock. However, this\nis all you must decide, and your probability of a successful crossing\nis entirely up to you; the environment is not interested in your\nplans.\n\nHowever, if we now complicate the situation by adding a non-parametric\nelement, it becomes more challenging. Suppose that you are a fugitive\nof some sort, and waiting on the other side of the river with a gun is\nyour pursuer. She will catch and shoot you, let us suppose, only if\nshe waits at the bridge you try to cross; otherwise, you will escape.\nAs you reason through your choice of bridge, it occurs to you that she\nis over there trying to anticipate your reasoning. It will seem that,\nsurely, choosing the safe bridge straight away would be a mistake,\nsince that is just where she will expect you, and your chances of\ndeath rise to certainty. So perhaps you should risk the rocks, since\nthese odds are much better. But wait \u2026 if you can reach this\nconclusion, your pursuer, who is just as well-informed as you are, can\nanticipate that you will reach it, and will be waiting for you if you\nevade the rocks. So perhaps you must take your chances with the\ncobras; that is what she must least expect. But, then, no \u2026 if\nshe expects that you will expect that she will least expect this, then\nshe will most expect it. This dilemma, you realize with dread, is\ngeneral: you must do what your pursuer least expects; but whatever you\nmost expect her to least expect is automatically what she will most\nexpect. You appear to be trapped in indecision. But what should\nconsole you somewhat here is that, on the other side of the river,\nyour pursuer is trapped in exactly the same quandary, unable to decide\nwhich bridge to wait at because as soon as she imagines committing to\none, she will notice that if she can find a best reason to pick a\nbridge, you can anticipate that same reason and then avoid her.\n\nWe know from experience that, in situations such as this, people do\nnot usually stand and dither in circles forever. As we\u2019ll see\nlater, there is a unique best solution available to each\nplayer. However, until the 1940s neither philosophers nor economists\nknew how to find it mathematically. As a result, economists were\nforced to treat non-parametric influences as if they were\ncomplications on parametric ones. This is likely to strike the reader\nas odd, since, as our example of the bridge-crossing problem was meant\nto show, non-parametric features are often fundamental features of\ndecision-making problems. Part of the explanation for game\ntheory\u2019s relatively late entry into the field lies in the\nproblems with which economists had historically been concerned.\nClassical economists, such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, were\nmainly interested in the question of how agents in very large\nmarkets\u2014whole nations\u2014could interact so as to bring about\nmaximum monetary wealth for themselves. Smith\u2019s basic insight,\nthat efficiency is best maximized by agents first differentiating\ntheir potential contributions and then freely seeking mutually\nadvantageous bargains, was mathematically verified in the twentieth\ncentury. However, the demonstration of this fact applies only in\nconditions of \u2018perfect competition,\u2019 that is, when\nindividuals or firms face no costs of entry or exit into markets, when\nthere are no economies of scale, and when no agents\u2019 actions\nhave unintended side-effects on other agents\u2019 well-being.\nEconomists always recognized that this set of assumptions is purely an\nidealization for purposes of analysis, not a possible state of affairs\nanyone could try (or should want to try) to institutionally establish.\nBut until the mathematics of game theory matured near the end of the\n1970s, economists had to hope that the more closely a market\napproximates perfect competition, the more efficient it will\nbe. No such hope, however, can be mathematically or logically\njustified in general; indeed, as a strict generalization the\nassumption was shown to be false as far back as the 1950s.\n\nThis article is not about the foundations of economics, but it is\nimportant for understanding the origins and scope of game theory to\nknow that perfectly competitive markets have built into them a feature\nthat renders them susceptible to parametric analysis. Because agents\nface no entry costs to markets, they will open shop in any given\nmarket until competition drives all profits to zero. This implies that\nif production costs are fixed and demand is exogenous, then agents\nhave no options about how much to produce if they are trying to\nmaximize the differences between their costs and their revenues. These\nproduction levels can be determined separately for each agent, so none\nneed pay attention to what the others are doing; each agent treats her\ncounterparts as passive features of the environment. The other kind of\nsituation to which classical economic analysis can be applied without\nrecourse to game theory is that of a monopoly facing many customers.\nHere, as long as no customer has a share of demand large enough to\nexert strategic leverage, non-parametric considerations drop out and\nthe firm\u2019s task is only to identify the combination of price and\nproduction quantity at which it maximizes profit. However, both\nperfect and monopolistic competition are very special and unusual\nmarket arrangements. Prior to the advent of game theory, therefore,\neconomists were severely limited in the class of circumstances to\nwhich they could straightforwardly apply their models.\n\nPhilosophers share with economists a professional interest in the\nconditions and techniques for the maximization of welfare. In\naddition, philosophers have a special concern with the logical\njustification of actions, and often actions are justified by reference\nto their expected outcomes. (One tradition in moral philosophy,\nutilitarianism, is based on the idea that all morally significant\nactions are best justified in this way.) Without game theory, both of\nthese problems resist analysis wherever non-parametric aspects are\nrelevant. We will demonstrate this shortly by reference to the most\nfamous (though not the most typical) game, the so-called\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma, and to other, more typical, games.\nIn doing this, we will need to introduce, define and illustrate the\nbasic elements and techniques of game theory.\n",
