    "main_text": "Intelligent Design and Traditional Creationism\n12. Recent Developments\n\nCreationism in the sense used in this discussion is still very much a\nlive phenomenon in American culture today \u2013 and in other parts\nof the world, like the Canadian West, to which it has been exported.\nPopularity does not imply truth. Scientifically Creationism is\nworthless, philosophically it is confused, and theologically it is\nblinkered beyond repair. The same is true of its offspring,\nIntelligent Design Theory. But do not underestimate its social and\npolitical power. As we move through the second decade of the new\nmillennium, thanks to Johnson and his fellows, there are ongoing\npressures to introduce non-evolutionary ideas into science curricula,\nespecially into the science curricula of publicly funded schools in\nthe United States of America. In 2004, in Dover, Pennsylvania, there\nwas an attempt by the school board to introduce Intelligent Design\nTheory into the biology classrooms of the publicly funded schools. As\nit happens, this was rejected strongly by the federal judge trying the\ncase \u2013 a man who was appointed by President George W. Bush no\nless \u2013 and the costs of the case will surely deter others from\nrushing to follow the example of this board (who were incidentally\nthen promptly dropped by the voters.) (A lively account of this trial\nis by Lauri Lebo, The Devil in Dover: An Insider\u2019s\nStory of Dogma v. Darwin in Small-Town America. Philosopher\nRobert Pennock argued that IDT is not genuine science, and taking\nsomewhat of a post-modernist stance, philosopher Steven Fuller argued\nthat it as good science as any other. Pennock and Ruse (eds.) 2008 is\nan updated version of Ruse (ed.) 1988, and includes full discussion of\nDover as well as Arkansas.) The battle is not yet over and things\ncould get a lot worse before they get better, if indeed they will get\nbetter.  Already, there are members of the United States Supreme Court\nwho have made it clear that they would receive sympathetically calls\nto push evolution from a preeminent place in science teaching, and\nwith its turn to the right it would be foolish to assume that if a\ncase came its way that Creationism or ID theory would be rejected as\nunsuitable for public school classroom use. If additions are made,\nwith present appointments, we could find that \u2014 nearly a century\nafter the Scopes Trial, when the Fundamentalists were perceived as\nfigures of fun \u2013 Creationism in one form or another finally\ntakes its place in the classroom.\n\nUnfortunately at the moment, those opposed to Creationism are spending\nmore of their energies quarreling among themselves than fighting the\nopposition. There is a crop of \u201cnew atheists\u201d, including\nthe biologist and popular writer Richard Dawkins (2006) and the\nphilosopher Daniel Dennett (2005) who are not only against religion\nbut also against those \u2013 including non-believers \u2013 who do\nnot share their hostility. At least since the time of the Arkansas\ntrial, many fighting Creationism (including Gould 1999, 2002; Ruse\n2001) have argued that true religion and science do not\nconflict. Hence, evolutionists (including non-believers) should make\ncommon cause with liberal Christians, who share their hatred of\ndogmatic Christian fundamentalism. Prominent among those so arguing\ninclude the author of this piece, as well as Eugenie Scott of the\nNational Center for Science Education. They argue that in their\nhostility to religion, the new atheists get close to making their own\nviews quasi-religious \u2013 certainly they argue that Darwinism is\nincompatible with religion \u2013 and hence ripe for the\nCreationists\u2019 complaint that if Creationism is not to be taught in\nschools (because it violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s separation of\nChurch and State), then neither should evolution be so taught. It is\nto be hoped that this quarrel will soon subside. \n\nWe conclude by noting four recent developments in the Creationism\ndebate. First, a number of well-known philosophers have started to\nmake encouraging sounds about Intelligent Design Theory. Calvinist\nphilosopher Alvin Plantinga has long been a critic of naturalism and\nnow (in a work based on his 2005 Gifford Lectures at St Andrew\u2019s\nUniversity in Scotland) he extends this critique to Darwinian\nevolutionary theory, arguing that the evidence in its favor is scanty\n(Plantinga 2011). He hedges somewhat on alternatives, but gives a very\nsympathetic reading of the thinking of Michael Behe and clearly finds\nmuch in such a position that meshes nicely with his own theological\nconcerns. Coming from a very different perspective, as he is openly\natheistic, Thomas Nagel (2008) likewise finds much in modern biology\nthat worries and disappoints him\u2014he makes special reference to\nwhat seems to him to be a total inability to give a naturalistic\nexplanation of the origin of life\u2014and although obviously he does\nnot want to endorse Intelligent Design Theory, given the supposition\nthat it is God who is doing the designing, nevertheless he argues that\nIntelligent Design Theory should be taught as an alternative in\nstate-supported schools in the USA. Recently, in a full-length work,\nMind and Cosmos, he has continued this attack, arguing (2011,\n7) that \u201cthe idea that we have in our possession the basic tools\nneeded to understand [the world] is no more credible now than it was\nin Aristotle\u2019s day\u201d, thereby implying that the work of\nCopernicus, Galileo, Newton, and Einstein and Darwin has not led to\nany new tools needed to understand the world. Backing Nagel, at least\nin his visceral dislike of Darwinism, is another prominent American\nphilosopher Jerry Fodor, whose recent, co-authored book is titled\nWhat Darwin Got Wrong. Even if (with reason) Fodor might\nargue that he is no Creationist, his position is grist for their mill.\nA more thoughtful critique of Darwinism might allay this worry. \n\nIt is difficult to know how seriously one is expected to take these\ncriticisms. Let it be said that one would have a great deal more\nrespect for the arguments and conclusions put forward if they had been\ninformed by contemporary writings on evolutionary theory, for\ninstance, the brilliant and painstaking work of the husband and wife\nteam of Peter and Rosemary Grant (2007), who have spent decades\nstudying the evolution and speciation of finches in the Galapagos\nArchipelago. Or the groundbreaking work of people like Francisco Ayala\n(2009) as they study the molecular factors involved in ongoing\ndevelopment and change. Not to mention the seminal studies of Brian\nHall (1999) and Sean Carroll (2005) on the ways in which individual\ndevelopment can get reflected in long-term changes (so-called\n\u201cevo-devo\u201d). Though Richard Dawkins can put people off\nwhen he holds forth on matters philosophical or theological, that is\nno good reason simply to dismiss without argument his scientific\nclaims, as Plantinga often does. Likewise, it is true indeed that no\none yet has been able to spell out the full story of the origin of\nlife, but this doesn\u2019t justify Nagel\u2019s failure to mention that a huge\namount now is known about life\u2019s origins, most especially about the\ncrucial role played by the secondary ribonucleic acid RNA (rather than\nthe more familiar DNA) (Ruse and Travis (eds.) 2009). Until the criticisms\nput forward by Nagel, Plantinga, Fodor, etc. do start to take\nseriously modern science, we might justifiably continue to take them\nless than seriously. \n\nOne observation to make about these criticisms is that they are put\nforward by philosophers in the analytic tradition, which in its early\ndays involved some opposition to Darwinism (Cunningham 1996). This\ngoes back to Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, neither of whom\nhad much time for the theory and (in Russell\u2019s case at least) was\nmirrored by a strong dislike of American Pragmatism, a school of\nthought that did take Darwin very seriously (Ruse 2009). In both the\ncase of Russell and Wittgenstein this opposition is based primarily on\na mistaken identification of the thinking of Charles Darwin with that\nof\n Herbert Spencer.\n It was the latter who was much given to seeing evolutionary processes\nas justifying extraneous claims about the necessity of struggle and so\nforth, views that both Russell and Wittgenstein viewed with as little\nenthusiasm as did William Jennings Bryan. Russell learnt his dislike\nof evolution as applied to philosophy from his teacher Henry Sidgwick\nand Wittgenstein (like other European-born philosophers like Karl\nPopper) from the general culture of their youth. Significantly, those\nphilosophers of the English-speaking tradition of the twentieth\ncentury who have had kind words for Darwin \u2013 W.V.O. Quine,\nRichard Rorty, and Thomas Kuhn to name three \u2013 have all been\nsympathetic to Pragmatism in one form or another (Ruse 2018b,\n2018c; see also, the entry on \n pragmatism).\n\nSecond among new or revived discussions of Creationism and its various\naspects, one question often asked is why evolution in particular\nraises such ire in evangelicals and related religionists. The Bible\nstates that the sun stopped for Joshua and yet no one today worries\nabout the theological implications of the Copernican Revolution.\nMichael Ruse particularly, has argued strongly that the main reason\nfor the conflict is that often evolutionists \u2013 Darwinian\nevolutionists \u2013 turn their secular science into a religion, with\nmoral imperatives and much more (Ruse forthcoming). The argument is\nthat, as opposed to the Christian notion of Providence, where we are\nentirely in the hands of God, such evolutionists are progressionists,\nthinking that change is in our hands and can be for the better. In\ntheological terms, Creationists tend to be premillennialists,\nbelieving that Jesus will return and rule for a thousand years and all\nwe can do is get ready for this for instance through converting\nothers, as opposed to evolutionists who are postmillennialists,\nthinking (metaphorically) that paradise is to be made down here by us,\nbefore there is any appropriate talk of a Second Coming. \n\nThomas Henry Huxley, his grandson Julian S. Huxley, and today\u2019s most\neminent Darwinian evolutionist, Edward O. Wilson of Harvard, have been\nor are open in their secular religion building. Against the\nCreationist urge to save souls, they want to improve science education\n(THH), support public mega-works (JSH), and promote biodiversity\n(EOW). There is a strong odor of this secular religion building around\nthe New Atheists, like Richard Dawkins (2006), despite denials.\nExpectedly, this thesis has not gone down well with many\nevolutionists, and conversely has been welcomed by Creationists who\nhave long made this claim. It should be noted that the arguments do\nnot and are not intended to give comfort to Creationism as such. The\nclaim by Ruse and others (for instance Miller 1999 and Pennock 1998)\nis that there is a good, scientific theory of evolution, based on\nDarwin\u2019s mechanism of natural selection. They are not offering a\nthesis about the science, but more one almost sociological in trying\nto understand the tension. If the thesis proves true, then\nevolutionists themselves are in a better position to defend themselves\nand to defend their science.\n\nThird among developments in Creationist thinking, especially since the\nfailure at Dover, we find somewhat of a shift in strategy by religious\ncritics of Darwinism. Now it is the moral issues that are brought to\nthe fore. For instance, Richard Weikart (2004) claims that \u201cno\nmatter how crooked the road was from Darwin to Hitler, clearly\nDarwinism and eugenics smoothed the path for Nazi ideology, especially\nfrom the Nazi stress on expansion, war, racial struggle, and racial\nextermination.\u201d In a similar vein, in the 2008 film\nExpelled\u2014a work very favorable to Intelligent Design\nTheory\u2014the link is drawn explicitly. Philosopher David Berlinski\nis blunt: \u201cif you open Mein Kampf and read it, especially if you\ncan read it in German, the correspondence between Darwinian ideas and\nNazi ideas just leaps from the page.\u201d In other words, if you are\ninto Darwin, you are into National Socialism. \n\nAs always, as soon as one starts to look at things a little more\nclosely, the story becomes more complex (Richards 2013).  Let us agree\nthat something had to lead to Hitler and that given the racism that\ninfects huge amounts of nineteenth century thinking about\nhumankind\u2014including Darwin\u2019s Descent of Man\u2014one\nshould not give evolutionary theory a knee-jerk absolution. In fact,\nsome early twentieth century writers on war and strife, clearly\ninspired in some fashion by Darwin, give one great pause for\nreflection. Listen to the sometime member of the German High Command,\nGeneral Friedrich von Bernhardi. Darwinism endorses war endorses that\nwhich is morally good or acceptable. \u201cStruggle is therefore a\nuniversal law of Nature, and the instinct of self-preservation which\nleads to struggle is acknowledged to be a natural condition of\nexistence. \u2018Man is a fighter\u2019\u201d (von Bernhardi 1912,\n13). And \u201cmight gives the right to occupy or to conquer. Might\nis at once the supreme right, and the dispute as to what is right is\ndecided by the arbitration of war. War gives a biologically just\ndecision, since its decisions rest on the very nature of things\u201d\n(ibid., p. 15). Hence \u201cIt may be that a growing people\ncannot win colonies from uncivilized races, and yet the State wishes\nto retain the surplus population which the mother-country can no\nlonger feed. Then the only course left is to acquire the necessary\nterritory by war.\u201d \n\nYet when one turns to Hitler himself, one soon sees that any\nsimilarities are superficial. One doubts very much that the (to be\ngenerous) ill-educated Fuhrer had ever read Darwin, and his concerns\nare not that of the old English evolutionist.\n\nAll great cultures of the past perished only because the originally\ncreative race died out from blood poisoning. The ultimate cause of\nsuch a decline was their forgetting that all culture depends on men\nand not conversely; hence that to preserve a certain culture the man\nwho creates it must be preserved. This preservation is bound up with\nthe rigid law of necessity and the right to victory of the best and\nstronger in this world. Those who want to live, let them fight, and\nthose who do not want to fight in this world of eternal struggle do\nnot deserve to live. (Hitler 1925, 1, chapter 11)\n\n\n\u201cBlood poisoning\u201d! The worry here is about the Jews and\ntheir supposed ill-effects on pure races. The Jews do not get a\nmention in the Descent of Man (1871), and although Darwin\nsupposes that white races tend to wipe out others, it is not from any\nmental or physical superiority, but because we can tolerate their\ndiseases but they cannot tolerate ours! And this is all because whites\nhave had a bigger pool of variants to draw on than have others. \n\nA final brief (fourth) comment is that increasingly the struggle\nagainst Creationism and its various offspring is rapidly becoming a\nworld-wide struggle. Leading historian of the Creationism movement,\nRonald Numbers (2006), is particularly concerned about this fact. Not\nonly do we find Creationism on the rise in countries like the\nNetherlands (where, with its large conservative Protestant population,\nsuch a rise is not altogether unexpected) but we find enthusiasm in\nnon-Christian cultures, especially in cultures where Islam is a major\nfactor. The exact reasons for such a rise have, as yet, been barely\nexplored, but Numbers is surely right in thinking that theology\nprobably plays but a minor role, and more sociological\nfactors\u2014dislike of the hegemony of the West and the role that\nscience and technology play in such dominance\u2014are probably very\nsignificant. \n\nThe fact is that, for whatever reason, if anything Creationism is on\nthe rise. And with that somber point, this is perhaps a good place to\ndraw this discussion to a close. If this essay persuades even one\nperson to take up the fight against so awful an outcome, then it will\nhave served its purpose.\n",
