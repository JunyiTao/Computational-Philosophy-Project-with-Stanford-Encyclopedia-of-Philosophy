    "main_text": "Political Thought || Nationalism\n5.3 Nationalism\n\nSection VI of Two Concepts of Liberty is an ambivalent\ndiscussion of the ideals of national self-rule and \u2018national\nliberation\u2019, suggesting that these should not be identified with\nliberty, strictly speaking, but nevertheless reflect deep human needs\nfor belonging and recognition as members of a self-ruling group (see\nalso 2002a, 229). Berlin used the term \u2018nationalism\u2019\nsomewhat confusingly, to refer to two quite distinct, and morally very\ndifferent, phenomena. The first of these was what he also called\n\u2018national consciousness\u2019, the sense of belonging, of\ncollective identity, of which Herder had written. The second was the\n\u2018inflamed\u2019 form of this sentiment, which, feeding off of\nresentment, frustration and humiliation, became\n\u2018pathological\u2019. Berlin was sympathetic to the former,\ncritical of the latter, but he recognised the relationship between the\ntwo, and was thus aware of the power and allure of nationalism.\n\nAlthough Berlin traced to Herder the insight that belonging, and the\nsense of self-expression that membership bestows, are basic human\nneeds, it seems unlikely that he would have had to learn this lesson\nfrom him. It is more probable that it was his own appreciation of\nthese needs that attracted him to that author in the first place. He\nwas sharply aware of the pain of humiliation and dependency, the\nhatefulness and hurtfulness of paternalistic rule. His individualism\nand emphasis on liberty were qualified not only by his awareness of\nthe extent to which we are social beings whose identities are partly\ndetermined by the way we are regarded by others (2002b, 201), but also\nby his understanding of the human need for a sense of belonging to a\ncommunity \u2013 an awareness sharpened, if not generated, by his own\nexperience of exile, as well as by the influence of his mother\u2019s\npassionate\n Zionism.[26]\n",
