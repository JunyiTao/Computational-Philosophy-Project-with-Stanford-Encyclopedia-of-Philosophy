    "main_text": "Contemporary Philosophical Approaches to Tort Law || Fairness Theories\n4.7 Other Issues: Causation\n\nCausation, which is a further element of the tort of negligence, has\nfigured prominently in recent debates. Some of these debates are\nnormative. They concern whether causation is relevant to liability,\nbecause the causal upshots of careless behavior are beyond the control\nof the person who is careless. This, too, is a debate prefigured in\nHolmes, who wrote \n\n\nWhen a man commits an assault and battery with a pistol, his only act\nis to contract the muscles of his arm and forefinger in a certain way,\nbut it is the delight of elementary writers to point out what a vast\nseries of physical changes must take place before the harm is done.\n(1881: 91) \n\n\nA number of writers have sought to explain the consistency of\nwhichever moral ideas they suppose properly shape tort law with the\nrole of luck in negligence liability, and with the fact that tort law\nhas no analog of the criminal law\u2019s category of attempt\nliability (Alexander 1987; Ripstein 1998; 2007; Ripstein &\nZipursky 2001; Waldron 1997; Goldberg & Zipursky 2007).\n\nCausation also raises conceptual issues. The basic legal rule for\nfactual causation in a negligence action is that a defendant who has\nbreached a duty of care to a plaintiff is not liable for an injury to\nthat plaintiff unless the injury was caused by the defendant\u2019s\nbreach of the duty of care. The law understands the cause of an event\nas a necessary condition for its occurrence, typically cast in the\nvocabulary of \u201cbut-for\u201d causation: but for the\ndefendant\u2019s negligence, would the plaintiff have been injured?\nIf the plaintiff\u2019s injury would have happened even had the\ndefendant not been negligent, the plaintiff will not recover. This\nrequirement raises puzzling cases involving overdetermination, as when\na ship collides with two others in separate events, requiring it to be\nout of commission while each of its two sides is repaired, or when two\ndefendants pass the plaintiff\u2019s horse on opposite sides at the\nsame time, startling it simultaneously, or when multiple fires merge.\nThe but-for test is of no assistance in these cases, since it leads to\nthe counterintuitive conclusion that neither defendant caused the\nplaintiff\u2019s injury. Courts have developed various tools for\ndealing with these problems, and philosophers have offered\ninterpretations of the problems.\n\nA second causal issues arise in cases in which the ordinary burden of\nproof\u2014the plaintiff must ordinarily establish each of the\nelements of a tort on the balance of probabilities\u2014cannot be met\nbecause of factual uncertainty. In some cases, the factual uncertainty\nis itself the result of the negligence of multiple defendants, as when\ntwo hunters fire their guns negligently in the direction of a third,\ncausing a piece of buckshot to lodge in the third hunter\u2019s eye.\nHad the two defendants not been negligent, the plaintiff would not\nhave been injured, but the presence of more than one defendant\nconfounds the plaintiff\u2019s hope of proving that either one caused\nthe injury. The approach that most common-law courts (outside the UK)\nhave adopted for dealing with these cases strike most commentators as\nboth sensible and fair: both hunters are liable if they cannot\ncausally exculpate themselves. There are, however, deep questions\nabout whether the sensible rule about the burden of proof amounts to a\nlimited rejection of the causation requirement, or whether instead it\nis a distinctive interpretation of causation. In cases involving large\nnumbers of both plaintiffs and defendants, particularly in litigation\ninvolving mass torts, these questions are multiplied. Philosophers\nhave tried to offer interpretations of the results in these cases,\nwith some arguing that such cases require a different way of thinking\nabout the place of causation in tort law (Thomson 1984; Ripstein &\nZipursky 2001; Steel 2015a; 2015b).\n\nA third causal issue arises in cases in which more than one precaution\nis available to a defendant that would render the defendant\u2019s\nconduct safe enough (however that is to be determined). Some of those\nprecautions might have prevented the specific injury suffered by the\nplaintiff and others not (although all would reduce the risk to an\nacceptable level). For example, two forms of medical precaution might\nmake a procedure sufficiently safe but do so by reducing different\naspects of its characteristic risks. If the defendant physician takes\none of the precautions, but the other precaution would have prevented\nthe injury suffered by the plaintiff, the injury was the realization\nof the risk, yet the defendant was not negligent. As both a legal and\nas a philosophical matter, the question \u201cif the defendant had\nnot been negligent, would the plaintiff have suffered the same\ninjury?\u201d seems to admit of no single answer, but rather to\ndepend on which of the untaken precautions forms the relevant contrast\ncase (Gilboa 2019).\n",
