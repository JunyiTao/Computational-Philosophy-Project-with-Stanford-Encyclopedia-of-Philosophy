    "main_text": "Computability and Church\u2019s Thesis || What is Church\u2019s Thesis?\n1.2 What is Church\u2019s Thesis?\n\nChurch\u2019s thesis is the first of the following two propositions,\nbut the second plays an important role in discussions of the first. We\nuse the term \u201cCT\u201d for the conjunction of the two:\n\nCT1\nEvery intuitively computable function is recursive\nCT2\nEvery recursive function is intuitively computable.\n\n\nCT might be formulated in terms of \u03bb-definability or Turing\ncomputability or a number of other distinct mathematical conditions\nknown to be extensionally equivalent to recursiveness. Despite these\nequivalences, the differences are significant. On several occasions,\nG\u00f6del expressed a strong preference for Turing\u2019s analysis\nand there are good reasons for G\u00f6del\u2019s preference. These\nare amply detailed elsewhere (see the entry on the\n Church-Turing thesis\n as well as Davis 1965). Church himself thought that Turing\u2019s\nanalysis was superior to his:\n\n\ncomputability by a Turing machine \u2026 has the advantage of making\nthe identification with effectiveness in the ordinary (not explicitly\ndefined) sense evident immediately. (Church 1937a [BE: 934])\n\n\nThe identification of \u03bb-definability with intuitive\ncomputability was certainly not \u201cevident immediately\u201d. In\nfact, Church\u2019s student, Stephen Cole Kleene, reports that it\nonly gradually dawned on Church, Rosser (J. Barkley Rosser, also\nChurch\u2019s student), and himself that \u03bb-definability may\nserve as a precise counterpart of intuitive computability (Kleene\n1981). Kleene also describes the difficulty of giving\n\u03bb-definitions of certain basic number theoretic\nfunctions\u2014particularly the predecessor function\u2014given the\nparticular way Church gives \u03bb-expressions standing for integers\n(1981: 56; these \u03bb-expressions are described in\n supplement D).\n But the fundamental difficulty with\n CT1\n as Church (1936a) enunciates it is that it is given as a definition\nwithout any accompanying justification other than a brief sketch of a\nproof of the extensional equivalence of \u03bb-definability and\nrecursiveness (Kleene [1936] gives a more detailed proof). G\u00f6del\ncomplained of exactly this:\n\n\nHe [G\u00f6del] insisted \u2026 that it was \u201cthoroughly\nunsatisfactory\u201d to define the effectively calculable functions\nto be some particular class without first showing that \u201cthe\ngenerally accepted properties\u201d of the notion of effective\ncalculability necessarily lead to this class. (Davis 1982:12)\n\n\nG\u00f6del eventually held up Turing\u2019s analysis as a better\nmodel of computation precisely because Turing justifies the\nidentification of intuitive computation with Turing machine\ncomputation on the basis of a detailed analysis of what a human\ncomputer, equipped with paper and pencil, must actually do (Turing\n1936: \u00a79). It seems that a counterpart of Turing\u2019s\ncompelling analysis has yet to be given for the case of\n\u03bb-computation. It should be emphasized, however, that\nChurch\u2019s main aim was not to defend an analysis of computability\nbut rather to set the stage for a proof that a particular number\ntheoretic combinatorial problem is not solvable. So long as\ncomputation is defined as a finite process, cardinality considerations\nimply that non-computable functions must exist, and Church wished to\ndemonstrate that his combinatorial problem was one of these.\n\nFor most of its life, Church\u2019s view\u2014that\n CT1\n is not subject to mathematical proof, or any sort of mathematical\ntreatment at all\u2014has prevailed. But some such as Shoenfield,\n(and Church himself), have observed that\n CT2\n is subject to intuitive proof despite the lack of a\nmathematically precise definition of \u201ccomputable\u201d\n(Shoenfield 1967: 120). Shoenfield\u2019s view of CT2 has been\nseconded by Kripke. All that is needed, Kripke says, is \u201cjust a\ndirect argument\u201d (2013). Moreover, Kripke and others (e.g.,\nMendelson 1990) have challenged the received view that CT1 is not\namenable to mathematical treatment. Accordingly, the discussion of CT1\ndivides into two parts: The first part is the evidence usually adduced\nfor CT1 on the assumption that it is a definition or hypothesis not\namenable to proof; and the second part is the evidence derived from\nrecent attempts to support CT1 by mathematical arguments. The first\nsort of evidence we may term \u201cexternal\u201d and the second\n\u201cinternal\u201d. The emphasis in what follows is on\nChurch\u2019s role in these developments.\n",
