The most\nsignificant remaining text is On Dispelling Sadness (Ritter\nand Walzer 1938, also Butterworth 1992, Druart 1993, Jayyusi-Lehn 2002,\nMestiri and Dye 2004). This is also the work of al-Kindi that will be\nmost often cited by subsequent thinkers, for example by Miskawayh in\nhis Tahdhib al-Akhlaq (The Refinement of\nCharacter).\n\nOn Dispelling Sadness, as its title indicates, is a work in\nthe genre of philosophical consolation. Much of the text consists in\npractical advice, maxims and anecdotes that one may bear in mind when\none finds oneself affected by sorrow. One particularly striking passage\nallegorizes our earthly life as a temporary landfall during a sea\nvoyage; this image derives ultimately from Epictetus. The philosophical\nfoundations of the treatise, though, are laid in the early sections,\nwhere al-Kindi gives a principled argument against placing value on\nphysical objects. By their very nature, he says, wealth and other\nphysical goods are vulnerable and transitory. No one can be sure that\ntheir possessions will not be taken from them \u2013 they may\n\u201cbe seized by any power.\u201d And more crucially, the very fact\nthat they are physical means that they are subject to generation and\ncorruption, and are therefore fleeting. Instead, we should value and\npursue things that are stable and enduring, and that cannot be taken\nfrom us: these will be the things in the now familiar \u201cworld of\nthe intellect.\u201d To the extent that one\u2019s desires are\ndirected solely towards intelligible things, one will be invulnerable\nto sadness. This argument, then, shows that sadness is always needless.\nThe anecdotes and more practical \u201cremedies\u201d offered in the\nrest of the treatise are intended to make it easier for us to accept\nand live in accordance with this conclusion.\n",
