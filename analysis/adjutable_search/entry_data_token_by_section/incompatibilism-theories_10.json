    "main_text": "Agent-Causal Theories || Luck, Again\n3.2 Luck, Again\n\nWhile the appeal to agent causation might be thought to solve the\nproblem of luck, the objection has been raised that in fact it does\nnot help at all (Haji 2004; Mele 2005 and 2006: ch. 3; van Inwagen\n1983: 145 and 2000). Consider Leo. At a certain moment he agent-causes\na decision to tell the truth, and until he does there remains a chance\nthat he will instead, at that moment, agent-cause a decision to lie.\nThere is, then, a possible world that is exactly like the actual world\nup until the time at which Leo agent-causes his decision but in which,\nat that moment, Leo agent-causes a decision to lie. Nothing about the\nworld prior to the moment of the agent-causing accounts for the\ndifference between Leo\u2019s causing one decision and his causing\nthe other. This difference, then, is just a matter of luck. And if\nthis difference is just a matter of luck, Leo cannot be responsible\nfor his decision.\n\nIf in fact Leo\u2019s causing his decision constitutes his exercising\nfree will, then the difference between his causing a decision to tell\nthe truth and his causing a decision to lie is not just a matter of\nluck; it is a matter of how Leo exercises his free will. But what can\nbe said to support the claim that an agent\u2019s causing a decision\nis his exercising free will? Many hold that when an agent exercises\nfree will, it is up to the agent herself whether she does one thing or\nanother. A plurality of alternatives is open to the person, and the\nperson herself determines which alternative she pursues. It is also\nsaid that when an agent exercises free will, she is an ultimate source\nor origin of her action. An agent-causal account may be said to nicely\nrealize these conceptions of free will. On the assumption that\nincompatibilism is correct, the account\u2019s requirement of\nindeterminism is needed to secure the openness of alternatives. And\nits requirement of agent causation may be thought to secure the\nagent\u2019s determining, herself, which alternative she pursues, as\nwell as her originating her action. (Unlike what we have with any\nevent-causal view, with an agent-causal account, the agent is quite\nliterally an ultimate source or origin of her action.) If the account\nsatisfactorily realizes these conceptions of free will, then it may be\ncredibly claimed that the difference in question between worlds is a\nmatter of Leo\u2019s exercising his free will differently.\n",
