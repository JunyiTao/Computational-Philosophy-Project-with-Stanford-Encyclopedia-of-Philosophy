    "main_text": "The Basic Phenomenon of Moral Motivation\n1. The Basic Phenomenon of Moral Motivation\n\nThe basic phenomenon of moral motivation might be given a more\nsystematic depiction as follows, using \u2018P\u2019 to\nstand for some person or individual and \u2018\u03c6\u2019 and\n\u2018\u03c8\u2019 each to stand for some action:\n\nWhen P judges that it would be morally right to \u03c6, she is\nordinarily motivated to \u03c6; should P later become\nconvinced that it would be wrong to \u03c6 and right to \u03c8 instead,\nshe ordinarily ceases to be motivated to \u03c6 and comes to be\nmotivated to \u03c8.\n\nThis depiction aims to capture features of our common experience. As\nobservation suggests, people generally feel moved to do what they\njudge it right to do; what is more, their motivation ordinarily shifts\nto match or \u201ctrack\u201d changes in their moral judgments. If\nan individual judges it right to keep a promise rather than to aid a\nstranger in need, she will ordinarily feel moved, at least to some\ndegree, to act so as to fulfill the promise. If she comes to change\nher mind about the priority of her promise, she will ordinarily no\nlonger be moved to keep the promise and will be moved instead to\nprovide aid.\n\nBefore we turn to the many questions which the foregoing depiction\nleaves open, and which lie at the heart of debates about the nature of\nmoral motivation, we should make note of two important points. First,\nthe depiction says nothing about the strength of moral\nmotivation. For all that it tells us, the motivation all or some\npeople feel to do what they judge right might be extraordinarily weak.\nCommon experience suggests that moral motivation in fact tends to be\nfairly robust, but with one qualification to be noted later,\nphilosophical views about moral motivation generally follow the\ndepiction in taking no position regarding the exact strength of moral\nmotivation. Second, the depiction reflects a widely shared assumption,\none which forms part of the backdrop for debates about the nature of\nmoral motivation, namely, that moral motivation is a strikingly\nregular and reliable phenomenon. Throughout social life, in both\nour personal relations and our public interactions, we take it for\ngranted that moral judgments dependably, if not unfailingly, motivate,\nthat they effectively influence and guide how people feel and act.\nStill, the assumption is not wholly uncontroversial; indeed, some have\nexpressed serious doubts regarding whether moral motivation is as\nregular and reliable as we commonly suppose (Copp 1997, 50).\n\nThe basic phenomenon of moral motivation seems relatively\nstraightforward. The difficult philosophical task becomes one of\nattempting to understand and explain more fully and precisely the\nnature of moral motivation. Sections 2 and 3 explore two approaches to\nthe task. While the approach discussed in section 3 has been\npredominant, the approach to be considered briefly in section 2\nprovides an instructive contrast, as well as a useful first glimpse of\nhow ideas about moral motivation have been thought to bear on broader\nmetaethical questions. Section 4 explores more general considerations\nabout moral motivation and metaethics, while section 5 considers\nalleged implications for philosophical theories about moral motivation\nfrom recent work in empirical psychology. \n",
