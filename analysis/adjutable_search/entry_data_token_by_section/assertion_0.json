    "main_text": "Speech Acts\n1. Speech Acts\n\nConsider typical utterances made by means of the following\nsentences\n\n(1)\n\n\na.\nThere is beer in the fridge.\nb.\nIs there a beer in the fridge?\nc.\nI wish there were a beer in the fridge.\nd.\nPut a beer in the fridge!\n \n\n\nSentence (1a) would typically be used to make an assertion. The\nspeaker would tell or inform a hearer that there is\na beer in the fridge. Such an utterance of is called\nassertoric, or assertive. By contrast, (1b) would be\nused to ask a question (and the utterance would then be\ninterrogative), (1c) to express a wish (optative),\nand (1d) to make a command, or a request (imperative). This\nentry is about utterances of the first kind, and about the speech acts\nperformed by means of them.\n\nGottlob Frege emphasized the distinction between judging a thought\ncontent (what Frege called a Thought) to be true, and merely\nthinking/entertaining that content. Both are distinct from the content\nitself. Analogously, he distinguished between utterances with\nassertoric quality, or force (see below), and utterances\nwithout assertoric force. For instance, an assertoric\nutterance of\n\n(2)\nIf it is raining, there will be umbrella salesmen in the\nstreet.\n\n\nas a whole, by which the conditional proposition is asserted, contains\nas a proper part an utterance or the antecedent \u2018it is\nraining\u2019. But the utterance of \u201cit is raining\u201d is\nnot itself assertoric. The conditional can be true whether the\nantecedent is true or false, and hence the speaker\u2019s belief\nabout rain is left open by the assertion\n\nLike Frege, C.S. Peirce stressed the importance of distinguishing\n\u201cbetween a proposition and what one does with it\u201d. He also\nadopted, albeit implicitly, a distinction between force and\ncontent:\n\n\none and the same proposition may be affirmed, denied, judged, doubted,\ninwardly inquired into, put as a question, wished, asked for,\neffectively commanded, taught, or merely expressed, and does not\nthereby become a different proposition (Peirce [NEM]:\n 248).[2]\n\n\nFrege characterized the assertoric quality of an utterance as an\nassertoric force (\u201cbehauptende Kraft\u201d;\nFrege 1918a [TFR: 330]) of the utterance. This idea was later taken\nover by J. L. Austin (1962 [1975: 99\u2013100]), the founding father\nof the general theory of speech acts. Austin distinguished between\nseveral levels of speech act, including these: the locutionary act,\nthe illocutionary act and the perlocutionary act. The locutionary act\nis the act of \u201c\u2006\u2018saying something\u2019 in the full\nnormal sense\u201d (1962 [1975: 94]), which is the utterance of\ncertain words with certain meanings in a certain grammatical\nconstruction, such as uttering \u2018I like ice\u2019 as a sentence\nof English.\n\nThe notion of an illocutionary act was introduced by Austin by means\nof examples (1962 [1975: 98\u2013102]), and that is the normal\nprocedure. Illocutionary acts are such acts as asserting, asking a\nquestion, warning, threatening, announcing a verdict or intention,\nmaking an appointment, giving an order, expressing a wish, making a\nrequest. An utterance of a sentence, i.e., a locutionary act, by means\nof which a question is asked is thus an utterance with\ninterrogative force, an if an assertion is made, it has\nassertoric force.\n\nThe perlocutionary act is made by means of an illocutionary act, and\ndepends entirely on the hearer\u2019s reaction. For instance, by\nmeans of arguing the speaker may convince the hearer, and by\nmeans of warning the speaker may frighten the hearer. In\nthese examples, convincing and frightening are perlocutionary\nacts.\n\nThe illocutionary act does not depend on the hearer\u2019s reaction\nto the utterance. Still, according to Austin (1962 [1975:\n116\u20137]) it does depend on the hearer\u2019s being aware of the\nutterance and understanding it in a certain way: I haven\u2019t\nwarned someone unless he heard what I said. In this sense, the\nperformance of an illocutionary act depends on the \u201csecuring of\nuptake\u201d (Austin 1962 [1975: 117]). However, although\nAustin\u2019s view is intuitively plausible for speech acts verbs\nwith speaker-hearer argument structure (like x congratulates\ny) or speaker-hearer-content argument structure (x\ntells y that p), it is less plausible when the\nstructure is speaker-content (\u201cBill asserted that\np\u201d). It may be said that Bill failed to tell\nLisa that the station was closed, since she had already left\nthe room when he said so, but that Bill still asserted that\nit was closed, since Bill believed she was still\n there.[3]\n\nAustin had earlier (1956) initiated the development of speech act\ntaxonomy by means of the distinction between constative and\nperformative utterances. Roughly, whereas in a constative\nutterance you report an already obtaining state of affairs\u2014you\nsay something\u2014in a performative utterance you create\nsomething new: you do something (Austin 1956 [1979: 235]).\nAssertion is the paradigm of a constative utterance. Paradigm examples\nof performatives are utterances by means of which actions such as\nbaptizing, congratulating and greeting are performed. However, when\ndeveloping his general theory of speech acts, Austin abandoned the\nconstative/performative distinction, the reason being that it is not\nso clear in what sense something is done for instance by\nmeans of an optative utterance, whereas nothing is done by means of an\nassertoric one.\n\nAustin noted, e.g., that assertions are subject both to infelicities\nand to various kinds of appraisal, just like performatives (Austin\n1962 [1975: 13\u201366]). For instance, an assertion is\ninsincere in case of lying as a promise is insincere when the\nappropriate intention is lacking (Austin 1962 [1975: 40]). This is an\ninfelicity of the abuse kind. Also, an assertion is,\naccording to Austin, void in case of a failed referential\npresupposition, such as in Russell\u2019s\n\n(3)\nThe present King of France is bald\n\n\n(Austin 1962 [1975: 20]). This is then an infelicity of the same\nkind\u2014flaw-type misexecutions\u2014as the use of the\nwrong formula in a legal procedure (Austin 1962 [1975: 36]), or of the\nsame kind\u2014misinvocations\u2014as when the requirements\nof a naming procedure aren\u2019t met (Austin 1962 [1975: 51]).\n\nFurther, Austin noted that when it comes to appraisals, there is not a\nsharp difference between acts that are simply true and false, and acts\nthat are assessed in other respects (Austin 1962 [1975: 140\u20137]).\nOn the one hand, a warning can be objectively proper or improper,\ndepending on the facts. On the other hand, assertions (statements) can\nbe assessed as suitable in some contexts and not in others, and are\nnot simply true or\n false.[4]\n\nAs an alternative to the constative/performative distinction, Austin\nsuggested five classes of illocutionary types (or illocutionary\nverbs): verdictives, exercitives,\ncommissives, behabitives and expositives\n(Austin 1962 [1975: 151\u201364]). You exemplify a verdictive, e.g.,\nwhen as a judge you pronounce a verdict; an exercitive by appointing,\nvoting or advising; a commissive by promising, undertaking or\ndeclaring that you will do something; a behabitive by apologizing,\ncriticizing, cursing or congratulating; an expositive by acts\nappropriately prefixed by phrases like \u2018I reply\u2019, \u2018I\nargue\u2019, \u2018I concede\u2019 etc., of a general expository\nnature.\n\nIn this classification, assertion would best be placed under\nexpositives, since the prefix \u201cI assert\u201d is or may be of\nan expository nature. Austin explicitly includes the verbs\n\u201caffirm\u201d, \u201cdeny\u201d, and \u201cstate\u201d, in\nhis first group of expositives (1962 [1975: 162]). Marina Sbis\u00e0\n(2020) argues that assertion belongs to both expositives and to\nverdictives, insofar as assertion expresses a judgment/verdict.\n\nOther taxonomies have been proposed, for instance by Stephen Schiffer\n(1972), John Searle (1975b), Kent Bach and Robert M. Harnish (1979),\nFrancois Recanati (1987), and William P. Alston\n (2000).[5]\n",
