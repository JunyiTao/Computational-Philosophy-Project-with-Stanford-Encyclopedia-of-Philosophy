    "main_text": "Free algebras || Free rings\n6.2 Free rings\n\nWith no generators the free monoid, free group, and free ring are all\nthe one-element algebra consisting of just the additive identity 0. A\nring with identity means having a multiplicative identity, that is, a\nword \\(\\varepsilon\\). But this makes \\(\\varepsilon\\) a generator for\nthe additive group of the ring, and the free abelian group on one\ngenerator is the integers. So the free ring with identity on no\ngenerators is the integers under addition and now multiplication.\n\nThe free ring on one generator \\(x\\) must include \\(x^2 , x^3\\), etc.\nby multiplication, but these can be added and subtracted resulting in\npolynomials such as \\(7x^3 -3x^2 +2x\\) but without a constant term,\nwith the exception of 0 itself. The distributivity law for rings means\nthat a term such as \\((7x+x^2 )(2x^3 +x)\\) can be expanded as \\(7x^2\n+x^3 +14x^4 +2x^5\\). It should now be clear that these are just\nordinary polynomials with no constant term; in particular we are\nmissing the zero-degree polynomial 1 and so this ring has no\nmultiplicative identity. However it is a commutative ring even though\nwe did not specify this. The free ring with identity on one generator\nintroduces 1 as the multiplicative identity and becomes the ordinary\none-variable polynomials since now we can form all the integers. Just\nas with monoids, the free ring with identity on two generators is not\ncommutative, the polynomials \\(xy\\) and \\(yx\\) being distinct. The\nfree commutative ring with identity on two generators however\nconsists of the ordinary two-variable polynomials over the\nintegers.\n",
