Integrity and Moral Theory\n\nDespite the fact that it is somewhat troublesome, the concept of\nintegrity has played an important role in contemporary discussion of\nmoral theory. An important and influential line of argument, first\ndeveloped by Bernard Williams, seeks to show that certain moral\ntheories do not sufficiently respect the integrity of moral agents.\n(See Williams 1973 & 1981.) This has become an important avenue of\ncritique of modern moral theory. (See, for example, Scheffler 1993 and\nLomasky 1987.)\n\nModern moral theories, the most representative of which are\nutilitarianism and Kantian moral theory, do not concern themselves\ndirectly with virtue and character. Instead, they are primarily\nconcerned to describe morally correct action. Theories of morally\ncorrect action generally aspire to develop criteria by which to\ncategorize actions as morally obligatory, morally permissible, or\nmorally impermissible. Some theories of morally correct action also\nintroduce the category of the supererogatory: an action is\nsupererogatory if and only if it is morally praiseworthy, but not\nobligatory. The two theories of primary concern to Williams are\nutilitarianism and Kantian moral theory, and both of these are usually\ninterpreted as eschewing the category of the supererogatory. (See\nBaron 1995 for an argument that Kantian moral theory has no need for\nthe category of the supererogatory.) Williams maintains that both\nutilitarianism and Kantian moral theory are deeply implausible because\nof their integrity undermining effects. His argument against\nutilitarianism makes the more transparent appeal to the concept of\nintegrity and it is this argument that we examine here. (But see\nHerman 1983, Rogerson 1983, Jensen 1989, and Baron 1995, chapter four,\nfor critical discussion of the Williams\u2019s argument against\nKantian moral theory.)\n\nWilliams\u2019s argument against utilitarianism is directed against a\nparticular version of utilitarianism\u2014act-utilitarianism. This\nis, very roughly, the view that an agent is to regard as morally\nobligatory all and only actions that maximize general well-being. The\nact-utilitarian theory that Williams criticizes has an important\nfeature: it aspires to describe the correct form of moral\ndeliberation. It does more than specify what it is for an\naction to be morally correct, it specifies how an agent should think\nabout moral decisions. Agents should think about which of the actions\navailable to them will maximize general well-being and decide to act\naccordingly. Notice that this theory is completely impartial and that\nit makes no room for an agent to give special weight to personal\ncommitments, causes, projects, and the like. Act-utilitarianism\nrecognizes no personal sphere of activity in which moral reflection\noperates merely as a side-constraint.\n\nAccording to Williams, an agent who adopted this version of\nutilitarianism would find themselves unable to live with integrity. As\nhe puts it, to become genuinely committed to act-utilitarianism is for\na person to become alienated:\n\nin a real sense from his actions and the source of his actions in his\nown convictions. It is to make him into a channel between the input of\neveryone\u2019s projects, including his own, and an output of\noptimific decision; but this is to neglect the extent to which\nhis actions and his decisions have to be seen as the\nactions and decisions which flow from the projects and attitudes with\nwhich he is most closely identified. It is thus, in the most literal\nsense, an attack on his integrity. (Williams 1973, 117)\n\n\nWilliams\u2019s argument is based on the identity theory of\nintegrity, discussed above. Integrity, on this view, requires that\npersons act out of their own convictions, that is, out of commitments\nwith which they deeply identify. Act-utilitarianism seeks to replace\npersonal motivations of this kind with impartial utilitarian\nreasoning. Williams\u2019s argument appears to make acting with\nintegrity incompatible with acting in accordance with\nact-utilitarianism.\n\nWilliams develops the point with two famous and much discussed\nexamples (1972, 97\u201399). The example which best illustrates his\nargument involves the figure of George, a recent doctoral graduate in\nchemistry who is having difficulty finding work. George has young\nchildren. He also has poor health, limiting his job opportunities.\nGeorge\u2019s (unnamed) wife must work to support the family and on\nWilliams\u2019s story this causes a great deal of strain on the\nfamily. George has a strong commitment to pacifism, a conviction\namounting to an identity-conferring commitment. A dilemma arises for\nGeorge when more senior colleague tells him about a decently paid job\nin a laboratory doing work on biological and chemical warfare. If\nGeorge does not take up the job, it will almost certainly go to\nanother chemist, one without George\u2019s pacifist commitment, who\nwill pursue the development of biological and chemical weapons more\nvigorously than George. Should George take the job or not?\n\nThe most likely act-utilitarian conclusion here is that George should\naccept the job. This would contribute greatly to the well-being of his\nfamily as well as probably contributing to general welfare by\nforestalling some relatively zealous development of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Weighed in the balance are George\u2019s feelings in the\nmatter. The utilitarian calculation, if it really does come out this\nway, is demanding a sacrifice of George: that he put aside his\nopposition to, and distaste for, biological and chemical weapons\ndevelopment and deal with the anguish and alienation that may result\nfrom working in the laboratory.\n\nAccording to Williams, however, act-utilitarianism in fact demands a\ndifferent kind of sacrifice from George. It demands that he act\nwithout integrity, abandoning or ignoring a longstanding,\nidentity-conferring commitment to pacifism simply because maximum\ngeneral well-being is to be found elsewhere. This is just one,\nparticularly acute, example of the tendency of impartial utilitarian\ndeliberation to run roughshod over identity-conferring commitments,\ntreating them as no more than one source of utility among others. In\ngeneral, Williams concludes, identity-conferring commitments cannot\nplay the kind of role in act-utilitarian moral deliberation that is\nrequired for an agent to act with integrity, that is, for an agent to\nact with genuine conviction in matters of grave, identity-determining\nimportance to them.\n\nWilliams\u2019s critique of utilitarianism has spawned a large and\nimportant literature in which the argument has been interpreted and\nreinterpreted, redrafted, and much criticized. There are, nonetheless,\nthree main lines of response to the Williams\u2019s critique of\nutilitarianism. We consider them in turn. The first reply essentially\nconcedes the point and offers in response a development of utilitarian\nmoral theory, one aimed at avoiding the flaws that Williams sought to\ndemonstrate. One way to do this is by watering down the impartiality\nof utilitarian theory, explicitly factoring in the permissibility of\ngiving extra weight to one\u2019s own personal projects, commitments,\nand so on. (See Scheffler 1993 for a development of this view, and\nHarris 1989a and 1989b for criticism of the adequacy of this\nresponse.)\n\nAnother way to try and improve utilitarianism in response to\nWilliams\u2019s argument is to advance a less ambitious form of\nutilitarian moral theory. Recall that Williams criticizes a version of\nact-utilitarian moral deliberation, so one may respond to it\nby describing a version of utilitarianism that does not directly\ndictate the form of moral deliberation. Thus one might subscribe to an\nact-utilitarian account of morally correct action whilst not demanding\nthat someone like George approach life by deliberating in strictly\nutilitarian ways. Instead, utilitarianism may be thought to furnish\ncriteria from which to derive decision-procedures. (See Driver 2012,\nMoore 2007, Railton 1986, for discussion of such a view; Cox 2005,\nHoward-Snyder 1997, and Harcourt 1998 for criticism of it.)\n\nA second possible line of response to the argument is to deny the\npresupposition of Williams\u2019s argument that it is absurd for a\nmoral theory to undermine integrity. It may just be that moral demands\nupon us really are very stringent, and identity-conferring commitments\nmust sometimes (perhaps often) be sacrificed in the interests of, say,\nour acting to ameliorate preventable suffering. One might even\nconsider it a virtue of utilitarianism that it demonstrates how\ngenuinely difficult it is to preserve one\u2019s integrity when\nconfronting a world of massive and easily preventable suffering. (See\nAshford 2000 for an argument along these lines.)\n\nThe third, and most influential, line of response argues directly\nagainst the idea that utilitarianism demands that agents act against\ntheir convictions. Utilitarianism demands that agents adopt\nutilitarian ideals; that agents give utilitarian ideals the kind of\npriority that would have them function as the central\nidentity-conferring commitments of their life. Thus utilitarianism\ndoes not demand that one live without identity-conferring commitments\nat all, but that one live with utilitarian\nidentity-conferring commitments. Were George a utilitarian, he would\nnot have been acting against his convictions by taking a job in the\nchemical weapons factory. He does not lose his integrity simply in\nvirtue of his commitment to utilitarianism. Williams appears to\nconfuse the case in which a utilitarian George acts against his\npersonal interests (in which case his integrity would be preserved)\nwith the case in which a non-utilitarian George is somehow persuaded\nto act as a utilitarian (in which case his integrity would not be\npreserved). Acting as a utilitarian when one has no sympathy with\nutilitarianism may well diminish one\u2019s integrity, but such a\nloss of integrity is not attributable to utilitarianism and has no\nbearing on utilitarianism\u2019s plausibility as a moral theory. (See\nCarr 1976, Trianosky 1986 and Blustein 1991 for versions of this\ncriticism.)\n\nThe matter is not finally settled, however, for notice that\nWilliams\u2019s critique is premised on a version of the identity\ntheory of integrity. As we have seen, there are other plausible\ncandidates for an account of integrity and the critique of\nutilitarianism may well succeed better in their terms. The key issues\nare whether utilitarian commitment is compatible with a fully\nsatisfactory account of integrity, and if so, whether integrity is of\nsuch value and importance that the clash between integrity and\nutilitarian commitment undermines the plausibility of utilitarian\nmoral theory. An adequate account of integrity needs to deal with\nthese issues and to capture basic intuitions about the nature of\nintegrity: that persons of integrity may differ about what is right\nbut a moral monster cannot have integrity.\n\nStuart Rosenbaum (2015, 23, 41) claims that \u2018integrity is the\nheart of morality to most people\u2019, and that pragmatism alone can\naccommodate that centrality. He (2015, 24) argues that pragmatist\nconceptions render integrity more than \u2018useful in efforts to\nunderstand the moral life.\u2019 For Rosenbaum (2015, 27), \u2018The\nidea of integrity, focussed through the lens of pragmatism, enable a\ncohesive way of thinking about the many and diverse moral dimensions\nof life.\u2019 He (2015, 22) maintains that the idea of integrity\ndoes not \u2018play any distinctive role\u2019 in utilitarian,\ndeontological, or virtue ethics; and he laments (2015, 22, 28\u201333) what\nhe sees as the baleful historical influence of Platonism in\nmisdirecting moral philosophers\u2019 attention away from ordinary\npeoples\u2019 actual moral concerns. For Rosenbaum (2015, 34, 65),\nintegrity is not an a priori ideal, but provides for a\ncontext-sensitive, working theory of morality. A person\u2019s\nintegrity consists of their autonomy, their commitment to community\nvalues and traditions, and their commitment to the ideals of self and\ncommunity (2015, 87f.). \u2018Being a person of integrity is doing\none\u2019s best given one\u2019s values and the social and cultural\nconditions of one\u2019s environment (2015, 106). Thus Rosenbaum is\nin agreement with Williams that integrity lacks determinate content;\nbut he differs in qualifying the italicized declaration that integrity\n\u2018has no moral content of its own, no essence or ontology of\nits own, apart from the cultures, societies, and psyches that may\nrealize it\u2019 (2015, 20; cf.88). So it is that, although he sees\nuniversal applicability in this concept of integrity, and indeed in\naspects of integrity-based morality more widely, Rosenbaum (2015,\n103f.) is able to contemplate the possibility that even a\nsuicide-bomber may be a person of integrity.\n\nIn keeping with Williams\u2019 views, C\u00e9cile Laborde (2017,\n203) defines integrity as \u2018an ideal of congruence between\none\u2019s ethical commitments and one\u2019s actions\u2019, and\nargues (2017, 207) that two tests must be applied to claims (religious\nor otherwise) for exemptions from laws. These are the thick sincerity\nof the claimant, and the thin acceptability of the proposed exemption\n\u2014 which must thus be compatible with the basic rights of others. For\nLori Watson (2019, 656), no exemptions are permissible which are\n\u2018incompatible with the project of liberal egalitarian\njustice.\u2019 Giulio Fornaroli (2019, 659) goes further, concluding\nthat \u2018the notion of personal integrity is, by itself,\nunnecessary and possibly detrimental in a theory of justice.\u2019\n\n",
