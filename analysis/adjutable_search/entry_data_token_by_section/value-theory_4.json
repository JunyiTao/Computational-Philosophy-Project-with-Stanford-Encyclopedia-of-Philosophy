    "main_text": "Traditional Questions || Intrinsic Value\n2.1 Intrinsic Value\n2.1.1 What is Intrinsic Value?\n\nOf course, the central question philosophers have been interested in,\nis that of what is of intrinsic value, which is taken to\ncontrast with instrumental value. Paradigmatically, money is\nsupposed to be good, but not intrinsically good: it is supposed to be\ngood because it leads to other good things: HD TV\u2019s and houses\nin desirable school districts and vanilla lattes, for example. These\nthings, in turn, may only be good for what they lead to: exciting NFL\nSundays and adequate educations and caffeine highs, for example. And\nthose things, in turn, may be good only for what they lead to, but\neventually, it is argued, something must be good, and not just for\nwhat it leads to. Such things are said to be intrinsically\ngood.\n\nPhilosophers\u2019 adoption of the term \u201cintrinsic\u201d for\nthis distinction reflects a common theory, according to which whatever\nis non-instrumentally good must be good in virtue of its intrinsic\nproperties. This idea is supported by a natural argument: if something\nis good only because it is related to something else, the argument\ngoes, then it must be its relation to the other thing that is\nnon-instrumentally good, and the thing itself is good only because it\nis needed in order to obtain this relation. The premise in this\nargument is highly controversial (Schroeder [2005]), and in fact many\nphilosophers believe that something can be non-instrumentally good in\nvirtue of its relation to something else. Consequently, sometimes the\nterm \u201cintrinsic\u201d is reserved for what is good in virtue of\nits intrinsic properties, or for the view that goodness itself\nis an intrinsic property, and non-instrumental value is instead called\n\u201ctelic\u201d or \u201cfinal\u201d (Korsgaard [1983]).\nI\u2019ll stick to \u201cintrinsic\u201d, but keep in mind that\nintrinsic goodness may not be an intrinsic property, and that what is\nintrinsically good may turn out not to be so in virtue of its\nintrinsic properties.\n\nSee the\n\nSupplement on Atomism/Holism about Value\n\n\nfor further discussion of the implications of the assumption that\nintrinsic value supervenes on intrinsic properties.\n\nInstrumental value is also sometimes contrasted with\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d value. The idea behind this distinction is\nthat instrumental values lead causally to intrinsic values,\nwhile constitutive values amount to intrinsic values. For\nexample, my giving you money, or a latte, may causally result in your\nexperiencing pleasure, whereas your experiencing pleasure may\nconstitute, without causing, your being happy. For many\npurposes this distinction is not very important and often not noted,\nand constitutive values can be thought, along with instrumental\nvalues, as things that are ways of getting something of intrinsic\nvalue. I\u2019ll use \u201cinstrumental\u201d in a broad sense, to\ninclude such values.\n2.1.2 What is the Intrinsic/Instrumental Distinction Among?\n\nI have assumed, here, that the intrinsic/instrumental distinction is\namong what I have been calling \u201cvalue claims\u201d, such as\n\u201cpleasure is good\u201d, rather than among one of the other\nkinds of uses of \u201cgood\u201d from part 1. It does not make\nsense, for example, to say that something is a good can opener, but\nonly instrumentally, or that Sue is a good dancer, but only\ninstrumentally. Perhaps it does make sense to say that vitamins are\ngood for Jack, but only instrumentally; if that is right, then the\ninstrumental/intrinsic distinction will be more general, and it may\ntell us something about the structure of and relationship between the\ndifferent senses of \u201cgood\u201d, to look at which uses of\n\u201cgood\u201d allow an intrinsic/instrumental distinction.\n\nIt is sometimes said that consequentialists, since they appeal to\nclaims about what is good simpliciter in their explanatory\ntheories, are committed to holding that states of affairs are the\n\u201cprimary\u201d bearers of value, and hence are the only things\nof intrinsic value. This is not right. First, consequentialists can\nappeal in their explanatory moral theory to facts about what state of\naffairs would be best, without holding that states of affairs are the\n\u201cprimary\u201d bearers of value; instead of having a\n\u201cgood-first\u201d theory, they may have a\n\u201cvalue-first\u201d theory (see section 1.1.4), according to\nwhich states of affairs are good or bad in virtue of there\nbeing more things of value in them. Moreover, even those who take a\n\u201cgood-first\u201d theory are not really committed to holding\nthat it is states of affairs that are intrinsically valuable; states\nof affairs are not, after all, something that you can collect more or\nless of. So they are not really in parallel to pleasure or\nknowledge.\n\nFor more discussion of intrinsic value, see the entry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic value.\n",
