    "preamble": "\n\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric has had an unparalleled influence\non the development of the art of rhetoric. In addition to\nAristotle\u2019s disciples and followers, the so-called Peripatetic\nphilosophers (see Fortenbaugh/Mirhady 1994), famous Roman teachers of\nrhetoric, such as Cicero and Quintilian, frequently used elements\nstemming from Aristotle\u2019s rhetorical theory. These latter\nauthors, however, were not primarily interested in a meticulous\ninterpretation of Aristotle\u2019s writings, but were rather looking\nfor a conceptual framework for their own manuals of rhetoric. This is\none of the reasons why for two millennia the interpretation of\nAristotelian rhetoric has been pursued by those concerned primarily with\nthe history of rhetoric rather than philosophy. This association with\nthe rhetorical rather than with the philosophical tradition is also\nmirrored in the fact that in the most influential manuscripts and\neditions, the text of Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric (for its\ntransmission see Kassel 1971) was surrounded by rhetorical works and\nspeeches written by other Greek and Latin authors, and was thus seldom\ninterpreted in the context of Aristotle\u2019s philosophical works.\nIt was not until the last few decades that the philosophically salient\nfeatures of the Aristotelian rhetoric have been acknowledged (e.g. in\nthe collections Furley/Nehamas 1994 and Rorty 1996; for a more general\nsurvey of scholarship in the 20th century see Natali 1994). Most\nnotably, scholars became aware of the fact that Aristotle\u2019s\nrhetorical analysis of persuasion draws on many concepts and ideas\nthat are also treated in his logical, ethical, political and\npsychological writings, so that the Rhetoric became\nincreasingly perceived as well-integrated part of the Aristotelian\noeuvre. For example, Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is\ninextricably connected with the history of ancient logic (see Allen\n2008 and, more generally,\n ancient logic)\n and is often taken as an important inspiration for modern\nargumentation theory (see van Eemeren 2013 and, more generally,\n dialogical logic).\n Some authors have stressed the Rhetoric\u2019s affinity to\nAristotle\u2019s ethical theory (see e.g. Woerner 1990), while others\nwere attracted by Aristotle\u2019s rhetorical account of metaphor\n(see e.g. Ricoeur 1996 and, more generally,\n metaphor).\n Most significantly, philosophers and scholars began to turn their\nattention to the Rhetoric\u2019s account of the passions or\nemotions, which is not only richer than in any other Aristotelian\ntreatise, but was also seen as manifesting an early example of\ncognitive, judgement-based accounts of emotions (see e.g. Nussbaum\n1996, Konstan 2006 and, more generally, \u00a75 of\n emotion).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Aristotle\u2019s Works on Rhetoric\n\nThe work that has come down to us as Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric or Art of Rhetoric consists of three books,\nwhile the ancient catalogue of the Aristotelian works, reported e.g.\nby Diogenes Laertius, mentions only two books on rhetoric (probably\nour Rhetoric I & II), plus two further books on style\n(perhaps our Rhetoric III?). Whereas most modern authors\nagree that at least the core of Rhetoric I & II presents\na coherent rhetorical theory, the two themes of Rhetoric III\n(style/diction and the partition of speeches) are not mentioned in the\noriginal agenda of Rhetoric I & II. The conceptual link\nbetween Rhetoric I & II and Rhetoric III is not\ngiven until the very last sentence of the second book, so the\nauthenticity of this seeming ad hoc connection is slightly\nsuspicious; we cannot rule out the possibility that these two parts of\nthe Rhetoric were not put together until the first complete\nedition of Aristotle\u2019s works was accomplished by Andronicus of\nRhodes in the first century. In Aristotle\u2019s Poetics\n(1456a33) we find a cross-reference to a work called\n\u2018Rhetoric\u2019 which obviously refers only to\nRhetoric I & II, but does not seem to include the agenda\nof Rhetoric III, suggesting that Aristotle at this time\nregards Rhetoric I & II as the complete work. Regardless\nof such doubts, the systematic idea that links the two heterogeneous\nparts of the Rhetoric \u2014 Rhetoric I & II on\nthe one hand and Rhetoric III on the other\u2014 does make\ngood sense: it is not enough, or so the linking passage says, to have\na supply of things to say (the so-called \u2018thought\u2019); one\nshould also know how to express or formulate those things (the\nso-called \u2018style\u2019), so that the project of\nRhetoric I & II concerning what we say (or the\n\u2018thought\u2019) needs to be complemented by the peculiar\nproject of Rhetoric III (i.e. a treatise on\n\u2018style\u2019).\n\nThe chronological fixing of the Rhetoric has turned out to be\na delicate and controversial matter. At least the core of\nRhetoric I & II seems to be an early work (see e.g.\nD\u00fcring 1966, 118\u2013125, Rist 1989, 85\u201386, Rapp 2002 I,\n178\u2013184), written during Aristotle\u2019s first stay in Athens\n(it is unclear, however, which chapters belong to that core; regularly\nmentioned are the chapters I.4\u201315 and II.1\u201317). It is true\nthat the Rhetoric also refers to historical events that fall\nin the time of Aristotle\u2019s exile and his second stay in Athens\n(see \u00a7 1 of\n Aristotle),\n but most of them can be found in just two chapters, namely chapters\nII.23\u201324, and moreover such examples could have been updated,\nwhich is especially plausible if we assume that the Rhetoric\nformed the basis of a lecture course held several times. However, what\nis most striking are its affinities to the early work Topics\n(for the idea that the Topics is early see e.g. Solmsen 1929,\n191\u2013195; for a discussion of Solmsen\u2019s theses in English\nsee Stocks 1933); if, as is widely agreed nowadays, the\nTopics represents a pre-syllogistic stage of Aristotelian\nlogic, the same is likely to be true of the Rhetoric, as we\nactually find only few or even no hints to syllogistic inventory in\nit. (Indeed, the Rhetoric includes two short passages that\nexplicitly refer to the Analytics, which presents\nAristotle\u2019s syllogistic theory: I.2, 1357a22\u20131358a2,\nII.25, 1402b13\u20131403a16. Some authors \u2014 e.g. Solmsen 1929,\n13\u201331, Burnyeat 1994, 31, Allen 2001, 20\u201340 \u2014 take\nthis as evidence that at least in these two passages the\nRhetoric makes use of the syllogistic theory, while others\n\u2014 e.g. Rapp 2002, II 202\u2013204 \u2014 object to this\ninference.)\n\nIt seems that Aristotle was the author not only of the\nRhetoric as we know it today, but of several treatises\ndealing with rhetoric. According to ancient testimonies, Aristotle\nwrote an early dialogue on rhetoric entitled\n\u2018Grullos\u2019, in which he put forward arguments for\nwhy rhetoric cannot be an art (techn\u00ea); and since this\nis precisely the position of Plato\u2019s Gorgias (see\n\u00a74 of\n Plato: rhetoric and poetry),\n the lost dialogue Grullos has traditionally been regarded as\na sign of Aristotle\u2019s (alleged) early Platonism (see Solmsen\n1929, 196\u2013208). But the evidence for the position defended in\nthis dialogue is too tenuous to support such strong conclusions: it\nalso could have been a \u2018dialectical\u2019 dialogue, simply\nlisting the pros and cons of the thesis that rhetoric is an art (see\nLossau 1974). We are in a similar situation concerning another lost\nwork on rhetoric, the so-called \u2018Techn\u00ea\nSunagog\u00ea\u2019, a collection of previous theories of\nrhetoric that is also ascribed to Aristotle. Cicero seems to use this\ncollection, or at least a secondary source relying on it, as his main\nhistorical source when he gives a short survey of the history of\npre-Aristotelian rhetoric in his Brutus 46\u201348. Finally,\nAristotle once mentions a work called\n\u2018Theodecteia\u2019 which has also been supposed to be\nAristotelian; but more probably he refers to the rhetorical handbook\nof his follower Theodectes, who was also a former pupil of Isocrates.\nFrom these lost works on rhetoric we only have a meagre collection of\nscattered fragments (frg. 68\u201369 R3, 114\nR3, 125\u2013141 R3: see Rose 1886).\n2. The Structure of the Rhetoric\n\nThe structure of Rhetoric I & II is determined by two\ntripartite divisions. The first division consists in the distinction\nbetween the three pisteis, i.e. \u2018persuaders\u2019 or\n\u2018means of persuasion\u2019, that are technical in the sense\nthat they are based on the rhetorical method and are provided by the\nspeech alone. And speech can produce persuasion either through the\ncharacter (\u00eathos) of the speaker, the emotional state\n(pathos) of the listener, or the argument (logos)\nitself (see below\n \u00a7 5).\n The second tripartite division concerns the three species or genres\nof public speech (see de Brauw 2008 and Pepe 2013). A speech that\ntakes place in the assembly is defined as a deliberative\nspeech. In this rhetorical genre, the speaker either advises the\naudience to do something or warns against doing something.\nAccordingly, the audience has to judge things that are going to happen\nin the future, and they have to decide whether these future events are\ngood or bad for the city or city-state (polis), whether they\nwill cause advantage or harm. A speech that takes place before a court\nis defined as a judicial speech. The speaker either accuses\nsomebody or defends herself or someone else. Naturally, this kind of\nspeech treats things that happened in the past. The audience, or\nrather the jury, has to judge whether a past event actually happened\nor not and whether it was just or unjust, i.e., whether it was in\naccordance with the law or contrary to the law. While the deliberative\nand judicial genres have their context in controversial situations in\nwhich the listener has to decide in favour of one of two opposing\nparties, the third genre does not aim at such a decision: an\nepideictic speech (e.g. funeral speeches, celebratory\nspeeches) praises or blames somebody, and tries to describe the\naffairs or deeds of its subject as honourable or shameful.\n\nThe first book of the Rhetoric treats these three genres in\nsuccession. Rhetoric I.4\u20138 deals with the deliberative,\nI.9 with the epideictic, I.10\u201314 with the judicial genre. These\nchapters are understood as contributing to the argumentative mode of\npersuasion (logos) or \u2014 more precisely \u2014 to that\npart of argumentative persuasion that is specific to the respective\ngenre of speech. The second part of the treatment of argumentative\npersuasion (logos) that is common to all three genres of\nrhetorical speech is treated in chapters II.19\u201326. The second\nmeans of persuasion, the one that works by evoking the emotions of the\naudience (pathos), is described in chapters II.2\u201311.\nAlthough the following chapters II.12\u201317 treat different types\nof character (\u00eathos), these chapters do not, as one\nmight infer, develop the first means of persuasion, i.e. the one that\ndepends on the character of the speaker. The underlying theory of this\nmeans of persuasion is rather unfolded in a few lines of chapter II.1.\nThe aforementioned chapters II.12\u201317 rather account for\ndifferent types of character and their disposition to emotional\nresponse, which can be useful for speakers who want to arouse the\nemotions of the audience. Why the chapters on the specific (in the\nfirst book) and the common (in the second book) argumentative means of\npersuasion (logos) are separated by the treatment of emotions\nand character (in II.2\u201317) remains a riddle, especially since\nthe chapter II.18 tries to give a link between the specific and the\ncommon aspects of argumentative persuasion \u2014 as though this\nchapter follows directly upon the end of Rhetoric I.\nRhetoric III.1\u201312 discusses several questions of style\n(see below\n \u00a7 8.1)\n while Rhetoric III.13\u201319 is dedicated to the various\nparts of a speech and their arrangement.\n\nOwing to ambiguities like these, the structuring of the\nRhetoric has always been somewhat controversial, since\ndifferent attempts to structure the work manifest different\ninterpretative decisions. By and large, though, the following\nstructure seems to capture its main topics and divisions:\n\nRhetoric I \n\n\nCh. 1: Rhetoric as a counterpart to dialectic \u2014\ndialectically conceived rhetoric is centred on proofs \u2014\nrhetorical proofs are \u2018enthymemes\u2019 \u2014 this is\nneglected by previous manuals of rhetoric that focus instead on\nemotions, slandering and on other techniques for speaking outside the\nsubject \u2014 \u201cspeaking outside the subject\u201d is\nforbidden in states with good legislation \u2014 the benefits of\nrhetoric.\nCh. 2: Rhetoric is the capacity to discern the available\npersuasive potential in any given case \u2014 means of persuasion\n(pisteis) based on the art (techn\u00ea) of\nrhetoric vs. artless means of persuasion \u2014 of the art-based\nmeans of persuasion (pisteis) there are three types:\n\n\nThrough the speaker: credibility of the speaker\n(\u00eathos)\nThrough the hearer: the emotional state of the audience\n(pathos)\nThrough the argument: proving or seemingly proving what is true\n(logos)\n Deductive and inductive types of rhetorical arguments \u2014\nthe enthymeme as the deductive type of rhetorical argument \u2014\npeculiarities of rhetorical arguments \u2014 enthymemes from\nprobabilities and signs \u2014 the technique of topoi\n\u2014 the difference between generally applicable and specific\ntopoi.\nCh. 3: There are three genres of public speech:\n\n\nJudicial (or forensic) speech deals with accusation and defence\nabout past events \u2014 aiming at the just/unjust.\nDeliberative (or political) speech deals with exhortation and\ndissuasion about future events \u2014 aiming at the\nadvantageous/harmful.\nEpideictic speech deals with praise and blame primarily with\nregard to the present time \u2014 aiming at the\nhonourable/shameful.\n \nCh. 4\u20138: Premises or topoi specific to the\ndeliberative speech: Types of advantageous/harmful things the speaker\nshould be familiar with (Ch. 4) \u2014 Happiness\n(eudaimonia) (Ch. 5) \u2014 what is good/advantageous (Ch.\n6) \u2014 what is better/more advantageous (Ch. 7) \u2014 the\nvarious constitutions (Ch. 8).\nCh. 9: Premises or topoi specific to the epideictic\nspeech: virtue and vice \u2014 the honourable and the\nblameworthy.\nCh. 10\u201314: Premises or topoi specific to the\njudicial speech: wrong-doing and motives for wrong-doing (Ch. 10)\n\u2014 pleasure (Ch. 11) \u2014 the state of mind of the wrong-doers\nand characteristics of their victims (Ch. 12) \u2014 kinds of just\nand unjust deeds, unwritten laws (Ch. 13) \u2014 degrees of\nwrong-doing (Ch. 14).\nCh. 15: Artless means of persuasion (i.e. means that cannot be\ninvented by the art, but are just given \u2014 such as contracts,\nlaws, witnesses, oaths, torture \u2014 and need to be used in one way\nor the other), mostly connected with judicial speech.\n\n\n\nRhetoric II\n\n\nCh. 1: Why persuasion through logos is insufficient\n\u2014 how persuasion through \u00eathos and\npathos is supposed to work.\nCh. 2\u201311: Particular types of emotions\n(path\u00ea) and their counterparts: anger (Ch. 2) \u2014\nmildness (Ch. 3) \u2014 loving/friendly affection (philia)\nand hating (Ch. 4) \u2014 fear and confidence (Ch. 5) \u2014 shame\nand lack of shame (Ch. 6) \u2014 gratefulness and lack of\ngratefulness (Ch. 7) \u2014 pity (Ch. 8) \u2014 indignation plus two\nnameless emotions (Ch. 9) \u2014 envy (Ch. 10) \u2014 emulation or\nambition (Ch.11).\nCh. 12\u201317: Different types of character\n(\u00eathos): the character of young people (Ch. 12), of\nelderly people (Ch. 13), of people in the prime of their life (Ch.\n14), of people of noble birth (Ch. 15), of wealthy people (Ch. 16) and\nof powerful people (Ch. 18).\nCh. 18: Transition to generally applicable aspects of persuasion\nthrough logos:\nCh. 19\u201325: Generally applicable aspects of persuasion\nthrough logos: topoi about the possible/impossible,\npast and future facts, significance and insignificance (Ch. 19)\n\u2014 examples: factual (report) and fictitious (the parable and the\nfable) (Ch. 20) \u2014

Rhetoric as a Counterpart to Dialectic\n\nAristotle stresses right from the beginning of his Rhetoric\nthat rhetoric is closely related to dialectic. He offers several\nformulations to describe the affinity between these two disciplines:\nin the first line of the book Rhetoric rhetoric is said to be\na \u2018counterpart\u2019 (antistrophos) to dialectic\n(Rhet. I.1, 1354a1); in the second chapter of the first book\nit is also called an \u2018outgrowth\u2019 or \u2018offshoot\u2019\n(paraphues ti) of dialectic and the study of character\n(Rhet. I.2, 1356a25f.); finally, Aristotle says that rhetoric\nis part of dialectic and resembles it (Rhet. I.2,\n1356a30f.).\n\nIn saying that rhetoric is a counterpart to dialectic, Aristotle\nobviously wants to allude to Plato\u2019s Gorgias (464bff.),\nwhere rhetoric is ironically defined as a counterpart to cookery in\nthe soul. Since, in this passage, Plato uses the word\n\u2018antistrophos\u2019 to indicate an analogy, it is\nlikely that Aristotle wants to express a kind of analogy too: what\ndialectic is for the (private or academic) practice of attacking and\nmaintaining an argument, rhetoric is for the (public) practice of\ndefending oneself or accusing an opponent.\n\nThe notion of \u2018dialectic\u2019 is prominent in the work of\nAristotle\u2019s teacher, Plato; Plato often labels his philosophical\nmethod, or certain parts of it, as dialectic. In his dialogue\nGorgias (see \u00a74 of\n Plato: rhetoric and poetry),\n dialectic seems to be strictly opposed to rhetoric, the former aiming\nat the disclosure of truth, the latter allegedly aiming at\n\u2018persuasion without knowledge\u2019. In his Phaedrus\nPlato pictures the relation between dialectic and rhetoric in a\ndifferent way (see \u00a75.1 of\n Plato: rhetoric and poetry);\n here he entertains the idea of a new philosophical rhetoric, quite\ndifferent from the then contemporary style of speech writing, which\nrests upon dialectic, the genuine philosophical method, for acquiring\ngenuine knowledge both of the subject matter of a speech and of the\nsoul of the audience. When Aristotle speaks of dialectic, he certainly\nhas his book Topics in mind, where he develops at some length\nan argumentative method for attacking and defending theses of any\ncontent (see \u00a78 of\n Aristotle: logic).\n Clearly, Aristotle\u2019s dialectical method was inspired by Plato\nand by the debates in Plato\u2019s Academy; however, while Plato\noften presents dialectic as a method for discovering and conveying\ntruth, Aristotelian dialectic is strictly confined to examining\nparticular claims or testing the consistency of a set of propositions\n(which in his view is different from establishing or proving the truth\nof a proposition). This is, in a nutshell, the context that must be\nkept in mind, when Aristotle presents \u2014 quite allusively \u2014\na new art of rhetoric by stressing its affinity to dialectic;\nobviously he plays upon his readers\u2019 expectations concerning the\nmeaning of dialectic and the relation between dialectic and rhetoric,\nas described by Plato. Those students of Plato\u2019s Academy who\nwere still suspicious about any engagement with rhetoric and public\nspeech possibly received the opening of Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric with its postulated affinity between rhetoric and\ndialectic either as a provoction or as some sort of joke.\n\nThis purported analogy between rhetoric and dialectic (as conceived by\nAristotle) can be substantiated by several common features of both\ndisciplines:\n\nBoth rhetoric and dialectic are concerned with things that do not\nbelong to a definite genus or are not the object of a specific\nscience.\nBoth rhetoric and dialectic are not dependent on the established\nprinciples of specific sciences.\nBoth rhetoric and dialectic have the function of providing\narguments.\nBoth rhetorical and dialectical arguments rely on assumptions or\npremises that are not established as true, but are only reputable or\naccepted by one group or the other (endoxa).\nBoth rhetoric and dialectic are concerned with both sides of an\nopposition, dialectic by constructing arguments for and against any\nthesis, rhetoric by considering what is possibly persuasive in any\ngiven case.\n\n\nThis analogy to dialectic has extremely significant ramifications for\nthe status of Aristotle\u2019s supposedly new art of rhetoric. Plato\nargued in his Gorgias that rhetoric could not be an art\n(techn\u00ea), since it is not related to a definite\nsubject, while real arts are defined by their specific subjects, as\ne.g. medicine or shoemaking are defined by their products (health and\nshoes). By claiming that rhetoric and dialectic are similar or\nanalogous, Aristotle suggests a quite different picture. The analogy\nis even meant to flesh out the thought that neither rhetoric nor\ndialectic are like ordinary arts (technai) or sciences with a\nlimited, well-defined subject matter. However, this should not be seen\nas a drawback, or so the analogy suggests, since the alleged\nshortcoming, i.e. that they do not have such a definite subject\nmatter, can be turned into a virtue, by entrusting to dialectic and\nrhetoric the practices that are common to all fields of rationality,\nnamely the various practices of argumentation. For even though\ndialectic has no definite subject, it is easy to see that it\nnevertheless employs a consistent method (both in Plato\u2019s and\nAristotle\u2019s understanding of dialectic), because dialectic has\nto grasp the ultimate reason why some arguments are valid and others\nare not. Now, if rhetoric is nothing but the counterpart to dialectic\nwithin the domain of public speech, it must be similarly grounded in\nan investigation of what is persuasive and what is not, and this, in\nturn, qualifies rhetoric as an art or, after all, as a discipline that\nis methodologically not inferior to dialectic.\n\nAs already indicated, it is crucial for both disciplines, dialectic\nand rhetoric, that they deal with arguments from accepted premises\n(endoxa). Dialecticians do not argue on the basis of\nestablished, scientific principles, but on the basis of only reputable\nassumptions, i.e. of what is accepted either by all or the many or the\nfew experts. In a similar vein, rhetoricians or orators try to hit\nassumptions that are already accepted by their audience, because they\nwant to persuade the addressees on the basis of their own convictions.\nOf course, owing to the different fields of application \u2014\nphilosophical\u2013academic debates in the case of dialectic, mostly\npublic speeches in the case of rhetoric \u2014 the situation is not\nquite the same. While e.g. the dialectician tries to test the\nconsistency of a set of propositions, the rhetorician tries to achieve\nthe persuasion of a given audience, and while dialectic proceeds by\nquestioning and answering, rhetoric for the most part proceeds in\ncontinuous\u2013monologic form. Still, and in spite of these\ndifferences, the method of both dialectic and rhetoric share the same\ncore idea that they have to hit certain, accepted assumptions of their\naddressees \u2014 the dialectical disputant in order to get the\nexplicit assent of the dialectical opponent, the rhetorician in order\nto base the rhetorical proofs on views the audience already finds\nconvincing. Furthermore, just as the dialectician is interested in\ndeductions and inductions for refuting the opponent\u2019s claims,\nthe rhetorician is interested in deductions and inductions that\nlogically connect (or seem to connect) the audience\u2019s existing\nconvictions with certain other views that the rhetorician wishes to\nestablish (see below\n \u00a7 6).\n For, indeed, Aristotle seems to think that arguments or proofs are\ncentral to any process of persuasion, for people are most or most\neasily persuaded, he says (Rhet. I.1, 1355a3f.), when they\nsuppose something to have been proven.\n\nHence the rhetorician who is willing to give a central place to\narguments or (rhetorical) proofs \u2014 and this seems to be the\npeculiar approach to rhetoric that Aristotle suggests at the beginning\nof his Rhetoric \u2014 can base his or her method of\npersuasion to a significant extent on the method of dialectical\nargumentation, as expounded in Aristotle\u2019s Topics (see\nRapp 2016 and 2018). And since the notion of \u2018dialectic\u2019\nis inextricably linked with a genuinely philosophical method, the\nimplied message of this dialectical turn of rhetoric seems to be that\nphilosophers, properly understood, have access to a method that is\nsuperior not only for internal academic discussions between\nphilosophers, but also for the so-called \u2018encounter with the\nmany\u2019 (Rhet. I.1, 1355a29, Topics I.2,\n101a35), i.e. for the purpose of addressing a mass audience with\nlittle or no education. As already indicated, Aristotle does not seem\nto have been the first to come up with the idea that\n\u2018true\u2019 rhetoric should become dialectical; however, while\nin Plato\u2019s Phaedrus the dialectical turn of rhetoric\nremains a mere sketch, Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric does not\nhesitate to set this idea into operation, most notably by adapting\nmost of the dialectical equipment developed elsewhere, especially in\nhis Topics. In many particular instances he just imports\ntechnical vocabulary from his dialectic (e.g. protasis,\nsullogismos, topos, endoxon); in many other\ninstances he redefines traditional rhetorical notions by his\ndialectical inventory, e.g. the enthymeme is redefined as a deduction,\nthe example is redefined as an induction, etc. Above all, the\nRhetoric introduces the use of the so-called topoi\n(see below\n \u00a7 7)\n that is typical for the dialectical method and is otherwise only\ntreated in Aristotle\u2019s works on dialectic, i.e. in\nTopics and Sophistical Refutations.\n4. The Nature and Purpose of Rhetoric\n\nThere are widely divergent views on the purpose of Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric. Ultimately, it is certainly meant to support those\nwho are going to address a public audience in court, at assemblies of\nthe people, or at certain festive events and who, to that end, have to\ncompose speeches. But does this in itself render the Rhetoric\na mere \u2018manual\u2019 or \u2018handbook\u2019 aiming at the\npersuasion of a given audience? Or does it rather aim at a\nspecifically qualified type of persuasion (bringing about, e.g.,\nconviction based on the best available grounds and without\nmisunderstanding)? Influenced by the debate in the 20th century about\n\u2018old and new rhetoric\u2019 and by the work of authors such as\nI.A. Richards, Kenneth Burke and Wayne C. Booth on the one hand and\nHans-Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricoeur on the other, Aristotle scholars\nbegan to wonder whether his Rhetoric is an instruction manual\noffering guidance about how to change other people\u2019s minds or\nhas, rather, a philosophically more ambitious scope, such as e.g.\nhuman communication and discourse in general. This second approach is\nreflected in the statements of those contending that the \u201cobject\nof Aristotle\u2019s treatise on rhetoric is ultimately an analysis of\nthe nature of human discourse in all areas of knowledge.\u201d\n(Grimaldi 1972, 1) or of those suggesting that it can be read as\n\u201ca piece of philosophic inquiry, and judged by philosophic\nstandards\u201d (Garver 1994, 3). Others have diagnosed a most\nnotable ambivalence in the Rhetoric (see Oates 1963, 335), as between\nits role as a practical handbook on the one hand and Aristotle\u2019s\nattempt to connect it to his logic, ethics and politics on the other.\nLikewise, interpreters are divided on the questions of whether\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is meant to be used for good and\nbad purposes alike or whether it is specifically tailored to\nimplementing the good and virtuous goals delineated in\nAristotle\u2019s ethical and political writings; and whether, to that\nlatter end, the speaker is entitled to deploy the whole range of\npersuasive devices, even manipulative and deceptive ones. In many\ninstances, the text of Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is open to\nseveral interpretations; however, it seems possible to restrict the\nrange of plausible readings, e.g. by considering Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition of rhetoric and what he says about the internal and\nexternal ends of rhetoric.\n4.1 The Definition of Rhetoric\n\nAssuming that Aristotle\u2019s Poetics gives instructions\nfor how to compose good tragedies, shouldn\u2019t we expect, then,\nthat Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is similarly meant to give\ninstructions for how to compose good speeches? And does this, by the\nsame token, render the art of rhetoric a sort of productive knowledge\naiming at the fabrication of a speech (similar to the way the art of\nshoemaking aims at the fabrication of shoes)? This sounds plausible,\nas far as it goes (for a discussion of this issue see Leff 1993), and\nin a few passages (especially in Rhet. III: e.g. 1415b35,\n1417a2, 1417a34f. and 36, 1418a10 and 12 and 39, 1420b1) Aristotle\nactually seems to directly address and instruct a speechwriter in the\nsecond person. However, these are rather exceptions to a broader\ntendency and it is striking that Aristotle never defines the art of\nrhetoric through the supposed product, the speech, nor the full\ncommand of the art of rhetoric through the perfection of the product,\ni.e. the excellent speech. Instead, Aristotle defines the rhetorician\nas someone who is always able to see what is persuasive\n(Topics VI.12, 149b25); correspondingly, rhetoric is defined\nas the ability to see what is possibly persuasive in every given case\n(Rhet. I.2, 1355b26f.). Indeed there are passages\n(Rhet. I.1, 1355b15\u201317) in which the persuasive plays\nthe same role in rhetoric as the conclusive plays in dialectic or\nlogic. This is not to say that it is the defining function\n(ergon) of rhetoric to persuade, for the rhetoricians (the\nones who possess the art of rhetoric) will not be able to convince\npeople under all circumstances (Rhet. I.1, 1355b10\u201314).\nRather they are in a situation similar to that of physicians: the\nlatter have a complete grasp of their art if and only if they neglect\nnothing that might heal their patients, although they are not expected\nto heal each and every patient. Similarly, rhetoricians have\na complete grasp of their method, if and only if they are capable of\nseeing the available means of persuasion, although they are certainly\nnot able to convince each and every audience \u2014 owing to\nfactors that the art of rhetoric cannot alter (e.g. biases,\npartisanship, stubbornness or corruption of the audience). In light of\nthis definition, it seems that the art (techn\u00ea) of\nrhetoric is primarily concerned with the nature and the ingredients of\npersuasiveness and that the book Rhetoric is primarily\nconcerned with elaborating the various ingredients of this art. It\ngoes without saying that possessing such an art is useful for the\ncomposition of speeches, but might also be useful for other purposes,\ne.g. for assessing other people\u2019s speeches, for analysing the\npersuasive potential of competing cases, etc.\n4.2 What Rhetoric Is Useful for\n\nFor Aristotle, who defines rhetoric in terms of considering what is\npersuasive (see above\n \u00a7 4.1)\n and sees it as a branch of dialectic (see above\n \u00a7 3),\n rhetoric is clearly not a matter of finding or conveying knowledge.\nFor Plato (see \u00a74 of\n Plato: rhetoric and poetry),\n by contrast, this would have been reason enough to become suspicious\nabout the intentions of those who use rhetorical techniques.\nIsn\u2019t any technique of persuasion that is negligent of knowledge\nuseful only for those who want to outwit their audience and conceal\ntheir real aims? For, after all, someone who just wants to communicate\nthe naked truth could be straightforward and would not need to employ\nrhetorical gimmicks. This, however, is not Aristotle\u2019s point of\nview: Even those who are simply trying to establish what is just and\ntrue need the help of rhetoric when they are faced with a public\naudience. Aristotle points out that it is impossible to teach such an\naudience, even if the speaker has the most exact knowledge of the\nsubject (Rhet. I.1, 1355a24\u201329). Perhaps he is thinking\nof ordinary people attending a public speech who are not able to\nfollow the kind of argument that, according to Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory of knowledge (see \u00a76 of\n Aristotle: logic),\n is apt to establish genuine knowledge. Moreover, he seems to doubt\nthat the controversial, sometimes partisan and hostile, setting of\npolitical or judicial speeches is suitable for teaching and learning\nat all, since whoever wishes to learn has to presuppose that he or she\nwon\u2019t be cheated or deceived by the teacher. But why should one\ntrust the intentions of the opposing party? This is why rhetorical\narguments addressing public audiences should be taken from premises\nthat are likely to be accepted by the given audience, from assumptions\nthe audience is already convinced of, and not from the kind of\nprinciples (accepted mostly or only by the experts) through which one\nconveys and establishes knowledge.\n\nMore than that, one might wonder whether the typical subject of public\nspeeches really allows of genuine knowledge. In court for example, the\njudges have to form a reasoned view about whether the accused person\nis guilty or not and whether the crime committed is minor or major; in\npolitical speeches the parties might contend about whether it is\nadvantageous or not to invade the neighbour\u2019s territory or to\nbuild a border wall (Aristotle\u2019s examples), but none of these\nquestions allow of precise knowledge. Aristotle says that in some\nquestions treated in public speeches there is only\namphidoxein, i.e. room for doubt and only divided opinions\n(Rhet. I.2, 1356a8). From this perspective, rhetoric seems\nuseful especially for controversies about contingent matters that\ncannot be fixed by appealing to what we unmistakably know, but only by\nappealing to widely shared convictions, to what happens (not\nnecessarily, but) only for the most part and to what is likely to be\nthe case (but not necessarily so). For all those reasons, affecting\nthe decisions of juries and assemblies is a matter of persuasiveness,\nnot of knowledge. It is true that some people manage to be persuasive\neither at random or by habit, but it is rhetoric that gives us a\nmethod to systematically disclose all available means of\npersuasion on any topic whatsoever.\n\nWhen Aristotle speaks about the benefits of the art of rhetoric he\nalso mentions that it is not only disgraceful when one is unable to\ndefend oneself physically, but also when one is unable to defend\noneself through rational speech, for rationality and speech are more\npeculiar to human beings than physical strength (Rhet. I.1,\n1355a38\u2013b2). A certain familiarity with rhetoric is therefore\nrequired for sheer self-defence \u2014 in general and, perhaps,\nespecially under the conditions of the extreme Athenian form of\ndemocracy with its huge courts of lay assessors (one of which\nsentenced Socrates to death) and with demagogues who would abuse the\ndemocratic rules for a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Perhaps Aristotle is\naddressing fellow philosophers who find it beneath their dignity to\nengage with rhetoric: it is not sublime but naive and embarrassing if\nthey do not gear up for political and legal battles. For those who are\ndefeated in court when they try to defend what is true and just (due\nto the failure to speak persuasively) are to be blamed (Rhet.\nI.1, 1355a20\u201324).\n4.3 Can Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric Be Misused?\n\nPossessing the art of rhetoric is useful then even for those whose\nsole intent is to defend what they take to be true and just. Still,\ncan\u2019t the same art of rhetoric be misused, e.g. when practised\nby people with malicious intentions? The short answer is: Yes, of\ncourse. Rhetoric in general and even Aristotle\u2019s dialectic-based\nrhetoric can be misused depending on what people use it for what\npurposes. (And Aristotle himself is actually aware of the fact that\ndemagogues of his time use a certain style of rhetoric for\noverthrowing the democratic order: Politics V.5,\n1304b21\u20131305a15). The more elaborate answer that he gives is\nthis. The art of rhetoric (if based on dialectic: see above\n \u00a7 3)\n is useful partly because it facilitates persuasive argument for the\nopposites, i.e. on either side of a question. This is first of all\nseen as an advantage in competence, for people who have full command\nof this art won\u2019t miss any persuasive aspect of a given\nquestion, and this is also seen as a practical advantage, for it helps\nto detect what goes wrong in the opponent\u2019s arguments\n(1355a29\u201338), especially if those opponents use it for\nobjectionable purposes. That this peculiar feature of dialectic-based\nrhetoric opens the door for misuse is true, but this cannot be held\nagainst the art of rhetoric, since the same ambivalence (that\nsomething can be used for the better or for the worse) applies to most\ngoods (e.g. wealth, beauty \u2014 the only non-ambivalent good is, on\nAristotle\u2019s view, virtue). Also, Aristotle downplays the risk of\nmisuse by stressing that it is easier to convince someone of the just\nand good than of their opposites (especially when using the\nAristotelian style of rhetoric).\n\nStill, for many interpreters of Aristotle, from the times of the great\nRoman rhetoricians on, it is hard to embrace the thought that\nAristotle \u2014 the famous author of the Nicomachean Ethics\nand the Politics \u2014 who in his ethical work praises the\nlife in accordance with human virtue, could ever endorse a rhetorical\nproject that is not meant to promote virtue and happiness in the\ncity-state (polis). Is it, in other words, possible or likely\nthat Aristotle, whose name in the history of moral philosophy stands\nfor an ethics based on the sustainable development of moral virtues,\nendorses a technique of rhetoric that does not serve the purpose of\npromoting virtuous goals? This is a legitimate worry. It can be\naddressed by distinguishing internal from external ends of rhetoric\n(which is, to be sure, not Aristotle\u2019s distinction; however, he\nuses a similar distinction between a thing\u2019s proper function,\ncorresponding to the internal end, and the question what something is\nuseful for, corresponding to the external end). The internal end, i.e.\nthe function that defines the art of rhetoric, is to consider what is\npersuasive (see above\n \u00a7 4.1),\n and since there might be persuasive aspects on both sides of a\nquestion, the art of rhetoric as such \u2014 i.e. according to its\ninternal end \u2014 is neutral with regard to true and false, just\nand unjust, noble and wicked points of view. It can be equally used\nfor promoting good or bad positions (even though, as Aristotle says,\nit is easier to promote the good ones). All this follows from the\ndialectical character of Aristotle\u2019s art of rhetoric (see above\n \u00a7 3).\n If we are interested, by contrast, in the external ends of rhetoric,\ni.e. the question of what it is useful for (see above\n \u00a7 4.2)\n or the question of how Aristotle himself wants this art to be used,\nthen it is easy to contrive a plausible story either based on\nAristotle\u2019s ethico-political writings or on hints given in the\nRhetoric itself (see e.g. Dow 2015, 64\u201375, for such an\nattempt) about the morally desirable uses of a style of rhetoric that\nis based on arguments (sanctioning convicted offenders, defending\ninnocent culprits, averting political decisions that are likely to do\nharm to the city-state, voicing the point of view of the decent\ncitizens, defending the rule of law, standing up to insurrectionists\nand demagogues, etc.).\n4.4 Is Aristotle\u2019s Conception of Rhetoric Normative?\n\nObviously, Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric is not thought to be normative\nin the moral sense that it would only provide the means for persuading\npeople of what is true, just and noble (but not of their opposites;\nsee section\n \u00a7 4.3\n above). There is however the widespread intuition that\nAristotle\u2019s rhetoric crucially differs from manuals of rhetoric\nthat recommend doing whatever it takes to win a case. This becomes\nclear already in the beginning of Rhet. I.1, where Aristotle\ncriticizes his predecessors among other things for presenting\ntechniques that are not derived from any art (techn\u00ea),\nsuch as slander and the arousal of pity and anger. He accuses them of\ndwelling on methods that instruct how to speak \u201coutside the\nsubject\u201d and to distract the attention of the hearers from the\nsubject, while good legislation, he says, requires not speaking\noutside the subject at all (indeed, \u201cspeaking outside the\nsubject\u201d was a legal term in Athenian law of Aristotle\u2019s\ntime). This immediately suggests two senses in which Aristotle\u2019s\nrhetoric is normative and does not advocate an \u2018anything\ngoes\u2019-approach to persuasion: first, the rhetorical devices are\nrequired to flow from the art or method of rhetoric and, second, they\nmust not be \u201coutside the subject\u201d. As for the first\ncriterion, Aristotle requires that art-based means of persuasion must\nbe provided by the speech alone and must rely on the systematic\nanalysis of what is persuasive in a given case (see the definition of\nrhetoric in\n \u00a7 4.1\n above). As for the second criterion, it is striking that Aristotle\nrefers to judges or jurors who just \u201csurrender to one of the\nlitigants without really judging\u201d (Rhet. I.1,\n1354b34\u20131355a1), which might be taken to mean that those people\ncast their votes in favour of the party they side with, but that their\nvotes are not based on a judgement that really considers the case at\nhand. This formulates a minimally normative criterion for what the\nrhetorical art aims at, namely the formation of a judgement in the\naudience that deserves to be called a \u2018judgement\u2019, i.e.\nthat it judges something, namely what the judges or jurors\nare asked to judge. And it seems that in rhetorical persuasion the use\nof rhetorical devices that are based on the art and are related to the\ncase at hand are more apt to bring about judgements in this genuine\nsense of the word.\n\nBy all appearances, it seems then that Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric is\nnot indifferent with regard to the persuasive means deployed. The\neffect that speakers using the Aristotelian style of rhetoric can\nbring about in the audience is thus qualified by the limited range of\ntechniques (based on the art of rhetoric) they use, which means that\nthey do not try to bring the audience over to their side at any cost,\nbut only on the basis of an argumentation that actually addresses the\npoint at issue. In this sense one might say that Aristotle\u2019s\nrhetorical method aims at something like \u2018persuasion based on\narguments\u2019, \u2018reasonable persuasion\u2019 or a\n\u2018reasoned judgment\u2019 on the audience\u2019s part.\n\nEven if this much is agreed upon, there remains a lot of room for\nscholarly disagreement on what exactly this normative approach to\nrhetoric is meant to imply. Is this normativity grounded in the\nrequirements of the art (techn\u00ea) alone, e.g. what can\nand what cannot be achieved in a methodical way, or does it hinge on\nan envisaged effect, e.g. the best possible judgement on the\nhearer\u2019s part? And which methods are approved by this normative\napproach and which definitely excluded? Does Aristotle\u2019s art of\nrhetoric require, above all, that persuasion be centred on arguments\nand proofs (that are related to the thing at issue and are, thus,\npertinent), while other art-based means of persuasion (see below\n \u00a7 5)\n are mostly thought to offer support to get one\u2019s arguments\nthrough (see e.g. Rapp 2012)? Or does the art aim at enhancing only\n\u201cwell-founded\u201d judgements or judgements that are\n\u201cformed on the basis of good grounds for conviction\u201d,\nrequiring that each particular means of persuasion provide such a good\nground for conviction (see Dow 2014 and Dow 2015)?\n5. The Three Means of Persuasion\n\nThe methodical core of Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is the\ntheorem that there are three \u2018technical\u2019 pisteis,\ni.e. \u2018persuaders\u2019 or \u2018means of persuasion\u2019.\nPersuasion comes about either through the character\n(\u00eathos) of the speaker, the emotional state\n(pathos) of the hearer, or the argument (logos)\nitself. The structure of Rhetoric I & II & is\ndetermined by this tripartition (see\n \u00a7 2\n above). The attribute \u2018technical\u2019 seems to imply several\nthings: (i) Technical persuasion must rest on a method or art\n(techn\u00ea), and this, in turn, is to say that we must\nknow the reason why some things are persuasive and some are not. (ii)\nFurther, technical persuasion must rest on a complete analysis of what\nis possibly persuasive (see above\n \u00a7 4.1),\n and not on the random use of scattered persuasive factors. (iii)\nTechnical means of persuasion must be provided by the speakers\nthemselves and through the speech, whereas pre-existing facts, such as\noaths, witnesses, testimonies, etc. are non-technical, since they\ncannot be brought about by the speaker. (iv) Given that Aristotle\ncriticizes his predecessors, because they deal with non-technical\npersuasive devices instructing how to speak \u201coutside the\nsubject\u201d (see section\n \u00a7 4.4\n above), one might speculate whether the technical means of persuasion\nare required, vice versa, to actually address the things at\nissue.\n\nWhy just these three? And why only these three? Aristotle does not\ngive an elaborate defence of this tripartition. However, he says in a\ndifferent context that a speech consists of three things: the speaker,\nthe subject that is treated in the speech, and the listener to whom\nthe speech is addressed (Rhet. I.3, 1358a37ff.). Probably, he\nthinks that each of these three ingredients of a speech contributes to\npersuasion in a specific way, in that persuasion either flows from the\nperson of speaker, namely that he or she comes across as credible, or\nfrom the condition of the hearer, i.e. whether they are in an\nemotional state and which emotional state they are in or from the subject\nthat is treated in the speech, i.e. from the arguments or proofs that\nare meant to support a suggested point of view. Summarizing the\naccount of the three pisteis in a later section of the book,\nAristotle actually insists that there can be no other technical means\nof persuasion:\n\nIt has already been spoken about the means of persuasion\n(pisteis), from how many things they are, namely that they\nare from three things, and what kind of things these are, and why\nthere are only these three; for all people who are casting judgements\nare persuaded either because they themselves are affected, or because\nthey assume that the speakers are a certain kind of person or because\nsomething has been proven. (Rhet. III.1, 1403b10\u201313)\n\n5.1 Persuasion Through the Character of the Speaker\n\nWith regard to the speaker, persuasion is accomplished whenever the\nspeech is held in such a way as to render the speaker worthy of\ncredence. How is it exactly that the credibility of the speaker\ncontributes to persuasion? Aristotle is not overly explicit on this\nissue. However, he says that people follow the trustworthy speaker\nmore easily and more quickly on almost all subjects and completely so\nin affairs in which there are not exact criteria (to decide the case),\nbut only wavering opinions (Rhet. I.2, 1356a6\u20138). This\nmight be taken to mean that in the absence of other criteria to decide\na case, the audience will form the second-order judgment that\nsuggestions put forward by a credible speaker are themselves received\nas trustworthy and acceptable. Also, according to this remark, the\nimpact of what seems to be the speaker\u2019s character comes in\ndegrees; it is most important, if the point of issue is such that it\nleaves room for doubt and cannot be decided by conclusive proofs.\n\nBut how does the speaker manage to appear a credible person? Even\nthough Aristotle says that the speaker\u2019s character can have the\ngreatest impact on the hearers\u2019 judgement (especially in\ndeliberative speeches that are about future states of affairs), he\ndedicates only fifteen lines to this question. (Rhet. II.1,\n1378a6\u201320). Speakers, he says, must display (i) practical\nintelligence, prudence or competence (phron\u00easis), (ii)\na virtuous character, and (iii) good will; for, if they displayed none\nof them, the audience would doubt that they are able to give good\nadvice at all. Again, if they displayed (i) without (ii) and (iii),\nthe audience could doubt whether their aims or intentions are good.\nFinally, if he displayed (i) and (ii) without (iii), the audience\ncould still doubt whether they are giving the best suggestion or\nwhether they keep the best available suggestion for themselves due to\ntheir lack of benevolence. However, if they display all of them,\nAristotle concludes, it cannot rationally be doubted that their\nsuggestions are trustworthy. It should be stressed that the speakers\nmust accomplish these effects by what they say in the speech;\nit is not necessary that they are actually virtuous persons: on the\ncontrary, a pre-existing good character cannot be part of the\ntechnical means of persuasion. Also, even a person with outstandingly\nvirtuous character would have to present herself as virtuous by what\nshe says in the speech.\n5.2 Persuasion Through the Emotions of the Hearer\n\nWith regard to the hearer, persuasion comes about whenever the hearers\nare led by the speech to feel a certain emotion or passion that, in\nturn, has an impact on the judgement they are going to make. The\nunderlying assumption of this persuasive technique is that\npeople\u2019s emotional states broadly conceived \u2014 i.e. whether\nthey actually undergo an episode of emotion or not and what kind of\nemotion they feel \u2014 makes a difference for the formation of the\njudgement they are about to pass. Indeed, Aristotle even introduces\nthe emotions or passions (path\u00ea) in an important\npassage (Rhet. II.1, 1378a20\u201330) by saying that they\nare \u201cthose things due to which people, by undergoing a change,\ndiffer in their judgements ...\u201d. He illustrates this\ngeneral assumption by pointing out that we do not judge in the same\nway when we grieve and rejoice or when we are friendly and hostile. It\ntherefore seems that the speaker has to arouse emotions exactly\nbecause emotions have the power to modify our judgments: e.g. to a\njuror or judge who is in a friendly mood, the person about whom he or\nshe is going to judge seems not to do wrong or only in a small way;\nbut to the juror or judge who is in an angry mood, the same person\nwill seem to do the opposite (see Rhet. II.1, 1378a1ff.).\nSince rhetoric aims at steering the hearers\u2019 judgement and since\nemotions, thus, have a significant impact on the formation of\njudgements (on the various ways how emotions, according to Aristotle,\ncan alter our judgements see Leighton 1982), the rhetorical method\nrequires to address the emotional states of the hearers, if only in\norder to calm down adverse feelings or emotions that are likely to\nprevent the jurors or judges from forming their judgement in\naccordance with the presented evidence and arguments.\n\nSome scholars writing on the rhetorical use of emotions take it to be\nsignificant that emotions also play a crucial role in\nAristotle\u2019s moral philosophy, for Aristotle defines the virtuous\nperson not only by performing the right actions, but also by having\nand by being motivated through the appropriate sort of emotions.\nApplying this to the rhetorical situation, one might wonder whether in\nAristotle\u2019s art of rhetoric the speaker tries to arouse\nemotions, in order (i) to motivate the audience (e.g. motivate them to\nact in accordance with the judgement they pass) or (ii) to turn them\ninto better persons (e.g. by providing and making them familiar with\nthe appropriate emotions that are definitory of the virtuous persons).\nHowever, both options are not backed by the evidence given in the text\nof the Rhetoric. With regard to (i), it seems crucial to note\nthat the aim of rhetorical persuasion is a certain judgement\n(krisis), not an action or practical decision\n(prohairesis), which would intrinsically involve a specific\nsort of desire and motivation (see e.g. Kontos 2021, 20\u201331).\nWhile the practical decision that Aristotle discusses in his ethical\nwritings is always about things the agents themselves are able to do,\nthe judgements of the hearers of a public speech are often about\nthings to be done by other agents or about actions that took place in\nthe past. With regard to (ii), one might be reluctant to accept that\nmoral education might be the direct purpose of the kind of public\nspeeches Aristotle has in mind. At least, no such moral purpose is\nmentioned when Aristotle addresses the purpose and use of rhetoric\n(see above\n \u00a7 4).\n It is also significant that the appropriateness of the aroused\nemotions (in accordance with Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the mean) is\nnowhere discussed in the Rhetoric. More than that, Aristotle\nseems to think that moral education requires individual habituation\nand habituation is a matter of gradually adjusting a person\u2019s\nattitudes and hedonic responses, while the uneducated ones are not\nreally responsive to disciplinary allocutions. For all these reasons,\nhe is not too optimistic with regard to the pedagogical effect of\npublic speeches: \u201cNow if speeches were in themselves enough to\nmake men good, they would justly, as Theognis says, have won very\ngreat rewards, and such rewards should have been provided; but as\nthings are \u2026 they are not able to encourage the many to\nnobility and goodness\u201d (EN X.9, 1179b4\u201310).\n\nBut how is it possible for the orator, in the first place, to lead the\naudience to feel a certain emotion? After all, the technical means of\npersuasion are restricted to what the speakers say in a\nspeech. It is remarkable that Aristotle\u2019s treatment of several\ntypes of emotions in Chapters 2\u201311 of Rhet. II is based\non the definition of each type of emotion. Even though Aristotle\nmostly leaves it to the reader to infer how these definitions are\nuseful for arousing a particular type of emotion, it seems safe to\nconclude that these definitions are meant to offer the key to the\nmethodical arousal of emotions in the audience. Let, for example,\nanger be defined as \u201cdesire, accompanied with pain, for\nconspicuous revenge for a conspicuous slight that was directed against\noneself or those near to one, when such a slight is undeserved.\u201d\n(Rhet. II.2 1378a31\u201333). According to such a\ndefinition, someone who takes it to be the case that he or she has\nsuffered a slight from a person who is not entitled to do so, etc.,\nwill, all other things being equal, become angry. Obviously, this\npresupposes an account of emotions according to which emotions are\nclosely related to what people think or take to be the case.\nUnfortunately and owing to the overall nature of Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric, this underlying account of emotion is nowhere\nexplicitly unfolded and defended. What we can infer though is that\nAristotle assumes at least a covariance between someone\u2019s\nthought or opinion that she has been slighted undeservedly and her\nfeeling of anger. If that much is granted and if the speakers have\naccess to such definitions of each type of emotions, it is possible to\ndeduce conditions under which a person is likely to feel this\nparticular type of emotion. And if the speakers manage to make the\nhearers think \u2014 by what they say \u2014 that these conditions\nare given, it is likely, as far as this method goes, that the hearers\nwill feel the corresponding emotion. Aristotle himself suggests the\nfollowing example. If we take the above-mentioned definition of anger\nfor granted, it is possible to deduce circumstances in which a person\nwill become angry; most notably, we can deduce (i) in what state of\nmind people are angry and (ii) against whom they are angry and (iii)\nfor what sorts of reason. If we want to make an audience angry, we\nhave to address all three factors, making the hearers think (ii) that\nthere are people who deserve their anger, (iii) that there is a reason\nfor being angry (a slight, an insult, a belittlement, etc.) and (i) by\nbringing them into a state of mind in which they are prone to anger.\nAristotle himself shows how to deduce these three factors for each\nparticular type of emotion throughout chapters II.2\u201311. With\nthis equipment, the speaker will be able, for example, to highlight\nsuch characteristics of a case as are likely to provoke anger in the\naudience. In comparison with the tricks of former rhetoricians (which,\nAristotle thinks, are bound to speak \u201coutside the\nsubject\u201d), this method of arousing emotions has a striking\nadvantage: The speaker who wants to arouse emotions need not even\nspeak \u201coutside the subject\u201d or distract from the thing at\nissue; it is sufficient to detect aspects of a given subject that are\nconnected with the intended emotion and to make the addressee think\nthat certain emotion-provoking aspects, in accordance with the three\nfactors mentioned above, are given.\n\nSupplement on Judgemental and Non-Judgemental Accounts of Aristotelian Emotions\n\n5.3 Persuasion Through the Argument Itself\n\nWith regard to the subject the speech is about, persuasion comes about\nthrough arguments, i.e. by proving (or seemingly proving) that\nsomething is the case. Most probably, this is meant to take up the\nidea mentioned above, i.e. that people are most or most easily\npersuaded, when they suppose something to have been proven\n(Rhet. I.1, 1355a3f.). This third means of persuasion\n(pistis) is distinguished from the other two means of\npersuasion through being the only probative (apodeiktikos)\ndevice of persuasion; due to its argument-like structure, involving\npremises and a conclusion, it can directly argue for the point of view\nthat the speaker wishes to establish. It does so by inferentially\nconnecting the suggested conclusion with facts that are evident or\nwith convictions already held by the audience. Probative persuasion is\nessential, since, at the end of the day, each speech necessarily\ninvolves a claim (i.e. the point of view the speaker suggests) plus\nthe proofs that are given in support of this claim (Rhet.\nIII.13, 1414a30\u201336). For Aristotle, there are two species of\narguments: inductions and deductions (Posterior Analytics\nI.1, 71a5ff.). Induction (epag\u00f4g\u00ea) is defined as\nthe proceeding from particulars up to a universal (Topics\nI.12, 105a13ff.). A deduction (sullogismos) is an argument in\nwhich, certain things having been supposed, something different from\nthe suppositions results of necessity through them (Topics\nI.1, 100a25ff.) or because of their being true (Prior\nAnalytics I.2, 24b18\u201320). The inductive argument in\nrhetoric is the example (paradeigma); unlike other inductive\narguments, it does not proceed from many particular cases to one\nuniversal case, but from one particular to a similar particular if\nboth particulars fall under the same genus (Rhet. I.2,\n1357b25ff.). The deductive argument in rhetoric is the enthymeme (see\nbelow\n \u00a7 6).\n Indeed, most of Rhet. I & II is dedicated to the\ntreatment of this third probative means of persuasion: After the\nsecond part of the long chapter Rhet. I.2 has introduced\nbasic distinctions within the probative mode of persuasion, chapters\nRhet. I.4\u201315 unfold argumentative devices that are\nspecific to the three genres of speech, while chapters Rhet.\nII.4\u201326 discuss generally applicable aspects of proofs or\narguments (see above\n \u00a7 2).\n\nAristotle repeatedly says that these rhetorical arguments persuade\npeople either by proving or by (merely) seeming to prove\n(Rhet. I.2, 1356a3\u20134 and I.2, 1356a19\u201320);\naccordingly, he lists topoi for real (Rhet. II.23)\nand merely apparent enthymemes (Rhet. II.24) (see below\n \u00a7 7).\n Obviously, Aristotle refers here to fallacious or deceptive\narguments, for these arguments have a similar persuasive effect, if\nthe fallacy or deception goes unnoticed by the audience (for people\nwill think, i.e. take it to be the case, that something has\nbeen proven). One might wonder whether the inclusion of only seemingly\nprobative arguments is compatible with Aristotle\u2019s general\ntendency to base rhetorical persuasion on (real) proofs. However, the\ntreatment of fallacious rhetorical arguments is strictly parallel to\nwhat happens in the case of dialectic. For dialectic too, includes a\npart dealing with sound or valid arguments (namely in Topics\nII\u2013VII) and a part that analyses fallacious arguments (namely in\nthe Sophistical Refutations). It is part of the\nrhetorician\u2019s competence also to know about fallacious\narguments, if only in order to detect them, when they are used by\nopponents.\n5.4 Is There an Inconsistency in Aristotle\u2019s Rhetorical Theory? \n\nOne of the most notorious debates about Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric concerns the second means of persuasion\n(pistis) that is said to proceed through the emotions of the\nhearer (see above\n \u00a75.2),\n for it seems to involve a major inconsistency in Aristotle\u2019s\napproach to rhetorical persuasion: While in Rhetoric I.2\nAristotle is happy to accept emotions or the arousal of emotions as\none of the three \u2018technical\u2019 pisteis, it seems\nthat he has a much more reserved or even repudiating attitude to the\nrhetorical use of emotions in Rhetoric I.1. There, in the\nvery first chapter of the book, Aristotle claims that the previous\nauthors of rhetorical manuals have only covered a small part of the\nart of persuasion, for while only the proofs or means of persuasion\n(pisteis), such as the enthymeme, are a matter of\ntechn\u00ea, those authors mostly dealt with rhetorical\ndevices that are merely supplementary and involve \u201cspeaking\noutside the subject\u201d. Aristotle exemplifies this alleged\ntendency of his predecessors by adding that \u201cslander, pity,\nanger and suchlike passions of the soul\u201d are not about the\nthings at issue, but are directed at the person of the juror or judge\n(1354a11\u201318). Briefly afterwards he adds that one \u201cshould\nnot distort the juror or judge by arousing anger, fear or pity in\nhim\u201d, which, he says, would be like making the standard or\nyardstick crooked before using it (1354a24\u201326). Apart from the\nfact that Rhetoric I.2 endorses the rhetorical use of\nemotions, while Rhetoric I.1 seems to dismiss them, the\nremarks in Rhetoric I.1 seems to imply that the arousal of\nemotions is not or cannot be \u2018technical\u2019, while\nRhetoric I.2 unequivocally introduces persuasion through the\nemotions of the hearer as one of three \u2018technical\u2019 means\nof persuasion.\n\nVarious strategies have been contrived to deal with this seeming\ninconsistency. In the early 20th century there was the tendency to\nthink that the two chapters are simply incompatible and that either\none of these two chapters was written by a different author (Marx\n1900) or that the two chapters were put together by an inept editor\n(Kantelhardt 1911; in a similar vein, Barnes (1995, 262) argues that\nthe two chapters are doublets, one of them originally written to\nsupplant the other) or that the two chapters represent different\nstages in Aristotle\u2019s philosophical development (Solmsen 1929).\nEven though Solmen\u2019s developmental account has gone out of\nfashion, there are more recent authors who emphasize the alleged\n\u2018Platonic\u2019 character of Rhetoric I.1 (see e.g.\nFortenbaugh 1986, 248 and Schuetrumpf 1994, 106f.), thus implying that\nAristotle, when writing this chapter, was still under the influence of\nPlato, from which he gradually emancipated himself. However, one might\nwonder whether some of the strategies mentioned tend to exaggerate the\nalleged inconsistency of the two chapters, since, after all, it is\nobvious that the two chapters have different agendas (see above\n \u00a7 2)\n and that some of the differences might be due to these different\nagendas. Also, in the later chapter Aristotle is happy to refer back\nto the treatment of emotions in the previous chapter\n(1356a16\u201317), which indicates (provided that this back-reference\nis authentic) that he himself was not aware of any inconsistency. It\nhas hence been suggested e.g. that the seeming inconsistency can be\nfixed just by identifying different meanings of the word\npistis for the two chapters (Grimaldi 1957), which would\nsolve the problem that in one chapter emotions are said to be a\npistis in the \u2018technical\u2019 sense, while in the\nother chapter they are opposed to \u2018technical\u2019\npisteis. Sprute 1994 and, similarly, Schuetrumpf 1994 argue\nthat the chapters are not inconsistent, but envisage different\nsettings, in that Rhetoric I.1 considers the kind of rhetoric\nthat is apt for a well-ordered city, while Rhetoric I.2 moves\non to the style of rhetoric that is required and practiced under less\nideal political circumstances. Rapp 2002 (I 364, II 32f., 109, 112)\nproposes that what Aristotle primarily criticizes in Rhetoric\nI.1 is not that those predecessors deal with emotions at all, but that\nthey mostly deal with emotions and the like, which are merely\nsupplementary, instead of dealing with the main point, i.e. the\nenthymeme, and that they use pre-fabricated formulae for the arousal\nof emotions, by which they are bound to speak outside the things at\nissue. Dow 2007 uses a similar idea of set-piece rhetorical devices,\ngoing however beyond the previous suggestion by saying that the\ncritique of Rhetoric I.1 does not, as it may seem, refer to\nemotions strictly speaking, but only to such set-piece rhetorical\ndevices aimed at manipulating emotions. On these accounts it is possible,\nat least, to reconcile the claims that there is a\n\u2018technical\u2019 and innocent (or, perhaps, even beneficial)\nuse of emotions within the art-based process of persuasion, as\nmaintained in Rhetoric I.2, and that there are\nnon-\u2018technical\u2019 uses of emotions in rhetoric with the\npotential to distort the judgement, as emphasized in Rhetoric\nI.1.\n6. The Enthymeme\n6.1 The Concept of Enthymeme\n\nFor Aristotle, an enthymeme is what has the function of a proof or\ndemonstration in the domain of public speech. Since a demonstration is\na kind of sullogismos, the enthymeme is said to be a\nsullogismos too (on the enthymeme and its relation to\nsyllogistic theory see also Raphael 1974). The word\n\u2018enthymeme\u2019 (from\n\u2018enthumeisthai\u2014to consider\u2019) had already\nbeen coined by Aristotle\u2019s predecessors and originally\ndesignated clever sayings, bon mots, and short arguments involving a\nparadox or contradiction. The concepts \u2018proof\u2019\n(apodeixis) and \u2018sullogismos\u2019 play a\ncrucial role in Aristotle\u2019s logical-dialectical theory. In\napplying them to a term of conventional rhetoric, Aristotle appeals to\na well-known rhetorical technique, but, at the same time, codifies and\nredefines the original meaning of \u2018enthymeme\u2019: properly\nunderstood, what people call \u2018enthymeme\u2019 should\nhave the form of a sullogismos, i.e., a deductive\nargument.\n\nA major scholarly debate concerns the question of whether the\nenthymeme is actually meant to be a genuine sullogismos, i.e.\na deductive argument, or whether it is only a\n\u2018sullogismos of a kind\u2019, i.e. a\nsullogismos in an attenuated sense, which would amount to\nsaying that Aristotelian enthymemes, even though they are introduced\nas sullogismoi, are or include \u2018relaxed\ninferences\u2019, i.e. inferences that are not logically valid (see\nBurnyeat 1994, 1996). This suggestion has been widely accepted,\npresumably because it helps to solve the alleged paradox that,\nalthough Aristotle defines the enthymeme as a sullogismos,\nthe logical form of the enthymemes that are actually given as examples\nin the Rhetoric does not seem to conform to that of the\ncategorical syllogisms that we know from his Prior Analytics\n(a problem that, by the way, might also be addressed by assuming that\nthe enthymeme corresponds to the form of deductive arguments we find\nin the Topics, not to the ones familiar from the Prior\nAnalytics). Others accepted this suggestion primarily in order to\naccommodate the non-necessary sign arguments from Rhetoric\nI.2 (see\n \u00a7 6.5),\n which are treated as a type of enthymeme (without being flagged as\nmerely \u2018seeming enthymeme\u2019), but are said not to yield a\nsullogismos (see e.g. Allen 2001).\n\nSupplement on the Thesis that Enthymemes are Relaxed Inferences\n\n6.2 Formal Requirements\n\nIn general, Aristotle regards deductive arguments as a set of\npropositions in which some sentences are premises and one is the\nconclusion, and the inference from the premises to the conclusion is\nguaranteed by the premises alone. Since enthymemes in the proper sense\nare expected to be deductive arguments, the minimal requirement for\nthe formulation of enthymemes is that they have to display the\npremise-conclusion structure of deductive arguments. This is why\nenthymemes have to include a statement as well as a kind of reason for\nthe given statement. Typically this reason is given in a conditional\n\u2018if\u2019-clause or a causal \u2018since\u2019- or\n\u2018for\u2019-clause. Examples of the former, conditional type\nare: \u201cIf not even the gods know everything, human beings can\nhardly do so.\u201d \u201cIf the war is the cause of present evils,\nthings should be set right by making peace.\u201d Examples of the\nlatter, causal type are: \u201cOne should not be educated, for one\nought not be envied (and educated people are usually envied).\u201d\n\u201cShe has given birth, for she has milk.\u201d Aristotle\nstresses that the proposition \u201cThere is no man among us who is\nfree\u201d taken by itself is a maxim, but becomes an enthymeme as\nsoon as it is used together with a reason such as \u201cfor all are\nslaves of money or of chance (and no slave of money or chance is\nfree).\u201d Sometimes the required reason may even be implicit, as\ne.g. in the proposition \u201cAs a mortal, do not cherish immortal\nanger\u201d the reason why one should not cherish mortal anger is\nimplicitly given in the term \u201cimmortal,\u201d which alludes to\nthe rule that it is not appropriate for mortal beings to have such an\nattitude.\n6.3 Enthymemes as Dialectical Arguments\n\nAristotle calls the enthymeme the \u201cbody of persuasion\u201d,\nimplying that everything else is only an addition or accident to the\ncore of the persuasive process. The reason why the enthymeme, as the\nrhetorical kind of proof or demonstration, should be regarded as\ncentral to the rhetorical process of persuasion is that we are most\neasily persuaded when we think that something has been demonstrated.\nHence, the basic idea of a rhetorical demonstration seems to be this:\nIn order to make a target group believe that q, the orator\nmust first select a proposition p or some propositions\np1 \u2026 pn that are\nalready accepted by the target group; secondly he has to show that\nq can be derived from p or p1\n\u2026 pn, using p or\np1 \u2026 pn as\npremises.  Given that the target persons form their beliefs in\naccordance with rational standards, they will accept q as\nsoon as they understand that q can be demonstrated on the\nbasis of their own opinions.\n\nConsequently, the construction of enthymemes is primarily a matter of\ndeducing from accepted opinions (endoxa). Of course, it is\nalso possible to use premises that are not commonly accepted by\nthemselves, but can be derived from commonly accepted opinions; other\npremises are only accepted since the speaker is held to be credible;\nstill other enthymemes are built from signs: see\n \u00a76.5.\n That a deduction is made from accepted opinions\u2014as opposed to\ndeductions from first and true sentences or principles\u2014is the\ndefining feature of dialectical argumentation in the Aristotelian\nsense. Thus, the formulation of enthymemes is a matter of dialectic,\nand the dialectician has the competence that is needed for the\nconstruction of enthymemes. If enthymemes are a subclass of\ndialectical arguments, then it is natural to expect a specific\ndifference by which one can tell enthymemes apart from all other kinds\nof dialectical arguments (traditionally, commentators regarded logical\nincompleteness as such a difference; for some objections against the\ntraditional view, see\n \u00a76.4).\n Nevertheless, this expectation is somehow misguided: The enthymeme is\ndifferent from other kinds of dialectical arguments insofar as it is\nused in the rhetorical context of public speech (and rhetorical\narguments are called \u2018enthymemes\u2019); thus, no further\nformal or qualitative differences are needed.\n\nHowever, in the rhetorical context there are two factors that the\ndialectician has to keep in mind if she wants to become a rhetorician\ntoo, and if the dialectical argument is to become a successful\nenthymeme. First, the typical subjects of public speech do\nnot\u2014like the subjects of dialectic and theoretical\nphilosophy\u2014belong to the things that are necessarily the case,\nbut are among those things that are the goal of practical deliberation\nand can also be otherwise. Second, as opposed to well-trained\ndialecticians, the audience of a public speech is characterized by an\nintellectual insufficiency; above all, the members of a jury or\nassembly are not accustomed to following a longer chain of inferences.\nTherefore, enthymemes must not be as precise as a scientific\ndemonstration and should be shorter than ordinary dialectical\narguments. This, however, is not to say that the enthymeme is defined\nby incompleteness and brevity. Rather, it is a sign of a well-executed\nenthymeme that the content and the number of its premises are adjusted\nto the intellectual capacities of the public audience; but even an\nenthymeme that failed to incorporate these qualities would still be an\nenthymeme.\n6.4 The Brevity of the Enthymeme\n\nIn a well-known passage (Rhet. I.2, 1357a7\u201318; similar:\nRhet. II.22, 1395b24\u201326), Aristotle says that the\nenthymeme often has few or even fewer premises than some other\ndeductions (sullogismoi). Since most interpreters refer the\nword \u2018sullogismos\u2019 to the syllogistic theory (see\nthe entry on\n Aristotle: logic),\n according to which a proper deduction has exactly two premises, those\nlines have led to the widespread understanding that Aristotle defines\nthe enthymeme as a sullogismos in which one of two premises\nhas been suppressed, i.e., as an abbreviated, incomplete syllogism.\nBut certainly the passages mentioned do not attempt to give a\ndefinition of the enthymeme, nor does the word\n\u2018sullogismos\u2019 necessarily refer to deductions\nwith exactly two premises. Properly understood, both passages are\nabout the selection of appropriate premises, not about logical\nincompleteness. The remark that enthymemes often have few or fewer\npremises concludes the discussion of two possible mistakes the orator\ncould make (Rhet. I.2, 1357a7\u201310): One can draw\nconclusions from things that have previously been deduced or from\nthings that have not been deduced yet. The latter method is\nunpersuasive, for the premises are not accepted, nor have they been\nintroduced. The former method is problematic, too: if the orator has\nto introduce the needed premises by another deduction, and the\npremises of this pre-deduction too, etc., one will end up with a long\nchain of deductions. Arguments with several deductive steps are common\nin dialectical practice, but one cannot expect the audience of a\npublic speech to follow such long arguments. This is why Aristotle\nsays that the enthymeme is and should be from fewer premises.\n\nSupplement on The Brevity of the Enthymeme\n\n6.5 Different Types of Enthymemes\n\nJust as there is a difference between real and apparent or fallacious\ndeductions in dialectic, we have to distinguish between real and\napparent or fallacious enthymemes in rhetoric. The topoi for\nreal enthymemes are given in chapter II.23, for fallacious enthymemes\nin chapter II.24. The fallacious enthymeme pretends to include a valid\ndeduction, while it actually rests on a fallacious inference.\n\nFurther, Aristotle distinguishes between enthymemes taken from\nprobable (eikos) premises and enthymemes taken from signs\n(s\u00eameia). (Rhet. I.2, 1357a32\u201333). In a\ndifferent context, he says that enthymemes are based on probabilities,\nexamples, tekm\u00earia (i.e., proofs, evidences), and signs\n(Rhet. II.25, 1402b12\u201314). Since the so-called\ntekm\u00earia are a subclass of signs and the examples are\nused to establish general premises, this is only an extension of the\nformer classification. (Note that neither classification interferes\nwith the idea that premises have to be accepted opinions: with respect\nto the signs, the audience must believe that they exist and\naccept that they indicate the existence of something else,\nand with respect to the probabilities, people must accept\nthat something is likely to happen.) However, it is not clear whether\nthis is meant to be an exhaustive typology. That most of the\nrhetorical arguments are taken from probable premises (\u201cFor the\nmost part it is true that \u2026\u201d \u201cIt is likely that\n\u2026\u201d) is due to the typical subjects of public speech,\nwhich are rarely necessary. When using a sign-argument or\nsign-enthymeme we do not try to explain a given fact; we just indicate\nthat something exists or is the case: \u201c\u2026\nanything such that when it is another thing is, or when it has come\ninto being, the other has come into being before or after, is a sign\nof the other\u2019s being or having come into being.\u201d\n(Prior Analytics II.27, 70a7ff.). But there are several types\nof sign-arguments too; Aristotle offers the following examples:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRhetoric I.2\nPrior Analytics II.27 \n\n(i)\nWise men are just, since Socrates is just.\nWise men are good, since Pittacus is good. \n\n(ii)\nHe is ill, since he has fever. / She has given birth, since she\nhas milk.\nThis woman has a child, since she has milk. \n\n(iii)\nThis man has fever, since he breathes rapidly.\nShe is pregnant, since she is pale.  \n\n\nSign-arguments of type (i) and (iii) can always be refuted, even if\nthe premises are true; that is to say that they do not include a valid\ndeduction (sullogismos); Aristotle calls them\nasullogistos (non-deductive). Sign-arguments of type (ii) can\nnever be refuted if the premise is true, since, for example, it is not\npossible that someone has fever without being ill, or that someone has\nmilk without having given birth, etc. This latter type of\nsign-enthymemes is necessary and is also called\ntekm\u00earion (proof, evidence). Now, if some\nsign-enthymemes are valid deductions and some are not, it is tempting\nto ask whether Aristotle regarded the non-necessary sign-enthymemes as\napparent or fallacious arguments. However, there seems to be a more\nattractive reading: We accept a fallacious argument only if we are\ndeceived about its logical form. But we could regard, for example, the\ninference \u201cShe is pregnant, since she is pale\u201d as a good\nand informative argument, even if we know that it does not include a\nlogically necessary inference. So it seems as if Aristotle\ndidn\u2019t regard all non-necessary sign-arguments as fallacious or\ndeceptive; but even if this is true, it is difficult for Aristotle to\ndetermine the sense in which non-necessary sign-enthymemes are valid\narguments, since he is bound to the alternatives of deduction and\ninduction, and neither class seems appropriate for non-necessary\nsign-arguments.\n7. The Topoi\n\nGenerally speaking, an Aristotelian topos\n(\u2018place\u2019, \u2018location\u2019) is an argumentative\nscheme that enables a dialectician or rhetorician to construe an\nargument for a given conclusion. The first comprehensive and\nsystematic collection of  topoi is given in Aristotle\u2019s\ntreatise Topics. Still, the use of so-called topoi\nor \u2018loci communes\u2019 can be traced back to early\nrhetoricians such as Protagoras, Gorgias (cp. Cicero, Brutus,\n46\u201348) and Isocrates. But while in earlier rhetoric a\ntopos was mostly understood as a complete, pre-fabricated\npattern or formula that can be mentioned at a certain stage of the\nspeech to produce a certain effect, most of the Aristotelian\ntopoi, in particular most of the dialectical topoi\nof the Topics, are general instructions saying that a\nconclusion of a certain form can be derived from premises of a certain\nform; and because of this \u2018formal\u2019,\n\u2018semi-formal\u2019 or, at least topic-neutral character of\nAristotle\u2019s dialectical topoi, one topos can\nbe used to construe several different arguments or arguments about\ndifferent contents. Aristotle\u2019s treatise Topics lists\nsome hundred topoi for the construction of dialectical\narguments. These lists of topoi form the core of the method\nby which the dialectician should be able to formulate deductions on\nany problem that could be proposed. Most of the instructions that the\nRhetoric gives for the composition of enthymemes are also\norganized as lists of topoi; especially the first book of the\nRhetoric essentially consists of topoi concerning\nthe subjects of the three genres of public speech (See Rhet.\nI.5\u201314), while chapters 23\u201324 of the second book of the\nRhetoric provide lists of generally applicable\ntopoi.\n7.1 The (Lacking) Definition of \u2018Topos\u2019\n\nIt is striking that the work that is almost exclusively dedicated to\nthe collection of topoi, the book Topics, does not\neven make an attempt to define the concept of topos. At any\nrate the Rhetoric gives a sort of defining characterization:\n\u201cI call the same thing element and topos; for an\nelement or a topos is a heading under which many enthymemes\nfall\u201d (Rhet. 1403a18\u201319). By\n\u2018element\u2019 Aristotle does not mean a proper part of the\nenthymeme, but rather a general scheme under which many concrete\nenthymemes of the same type can be subsumed. According to this\ndefinition, the topos is a general argumentative scheme or\npattern, and the concrete arguments are instantiations of the general\ntopos. That the topos is a general instruction from\nwhich several arguments can be derived is crucial for\nAristotle\u2019s understanding of an artful method of argumentation;\nfor a teacher of rhetoric who makes his pupils learn ready samples of\narguments would not be imparting the art itself to them, but only the\nproducts of this art, just as if someone pretending to teach the art\nof shoe-making only gave samples of already made shoes to his pupils\n(see Sophistical Refutations 183b36ff.).\n7.2 The Word \u2018Topos\u2019 and the Technique of Places\n\nThe word \u2018topos\u2019 (place, location) most probably\nis derived from an ancient method of memorizing a great number of\nitems on a list by associating them with successive places one is\nacquainted with, say the houses along a street. By recalling the\nhouses along the street we can also remember the associated items (on\nthis mnemonic technique see Sorabji 2004, 22\u201334). Full\ndescriptions of this technique from antiquity can be found in Cicero,\nDe Oratore II 86\u201388, 351\u2013360, Auctor ad\nHerennium III 16\u201324, 29\u201340 and in Quintilian,\nInstitutio XI 2, 11\u201333. In Topics\n163b28\u201332, Aristotle seems to allude to this technique:\n\u201cFor just as in the art of remembering, the mere mention of the\nplaces instantly makes us recall the things, so these will make us\nmore apt at deductions through looking to these defined premises in\norder of enumeration.\u201d Aristotle also alludes to this technique\nin On the soul 427b18\u201320, On Memory\n452a12\u201316, and On Dreams 458b20\u201322.\n\nBut although the name \u2018topos\u2019 may be derived from\nthis mnemotechnical context, Aristotle\u2019s use of topoi\ndoes not rely on the technique of places. At least within the system\nof the book Topics, every given problem must be analyzed in\nterms of certain linguistic, semantic or logical criteria: Does the\npredicate of the sentence in question ascribe a genus or a definition\nor peculiar or accidental properties to the subject? Does the sentence\nexpress a sort of opposition, either contradiction or contrariety,\netc.? Does the sentence express that something is more or less the\ncase? Does it maintain identity or diversity? Are the words used\nlinguistically derived from words that are part of an accepted\npremise? Depending on such criteria of the analyzed sentence one has\nto refer to a fitting topos. For this reason, the succession\nof topoi in the book Topics is organized in\naccordance with their salient linguistic, semantic or logical\ncriteria; above all topoi presented in Books II\u2013VII of\nthis treatise are structured in accordance with the four so-called\n\u2018predicables\u2019, i.e. whether a predicate signifies the\ngenus, an accident, a proprium (peculiar attribute) or the definition\nof the subject. This structure suggests that no additional\nmnemotechnique is essentially involved. Besides all this, there is at\nleast one passage in which the use of the word\n\u2018topos\u2019 can be explained without referring to the\npreviously mentioned mnemotechnique: In Topics VIII.1,\n155b4\u20135 Aristotle says: \u201cwe must find the location\n(topos) from which to attack\u201d, where the word\n\u2018topos\u2019 is obviously used to mean a starting\npoint for attacking the theses of the opponents.\n\nMore or less the same might apply to the\nRhetoric\u2014except that most of its lists of\ntopoi are structured by certain contents and not by\nlinguistic, semantic or logical criteria; moreover, the system of the\nfour \u2018predicables\u2019 that structured the topoi in\nthe Topics is absent from the Rhetoric (see below\n \u00a7 7.4).\n7.3 The Ingredients and the Function of Topoi\n\nA typical topos in Aristotle\u2019s dialectic runs as\nfollows: \u201cAgain, if the accident of a thing has a contrary, see\nwhether it belongs to the subject to which the accident in question\nhas been declared to belong: for if the latter belongs, the former\ncould not belong; for it is impossible that contrary predicates should\nbelong at the same time to the same thing\u201d (Topics\n113a20\u201324). Like most topoi, it includes (i) a sort of\ngeneral instruction (\u201csee, whether \u2026\u201d); further it\nmentions (ii) an argumentative scheme\u2014in the given example, the\nscheme \u2018if the accidental predicate p belongs to the\nsubject s, then the opposed P* cannot belong to\ns too\u2019. Finally, the topos refers to (iii) a\ngeneral rule or principle (\u201cfor it is impossible,\n\u2026\u201d) which justifies the given scheme. Other\ntopoi often include the discussion of (iv) examples; still\nother topoi suggest (v) how to apply the given\nschemes.\u2014Though these are elements that regularly occur in\nAristotelian topoi, there is nothing like a standard form\nwith which all topoi conform. Often Aristotle is very brief\nand leaves it to the reader to add the missing elements.\n\nIn a nutshell, the function of a topos can be explained as\nfollows. First of all, one has to select an apt topos for a\ngiven conclusion. The conclusion is either a thesis of the opponent\nthat someone wishes to refute, or it is the assertion someone wishes\nto establish or defend. Accordingly, there are two uses of\ntopoi: they can either prove or disprove a given sentence;\nsome can be used for both purposes, others for only one of them. In\nAristotle\u2019s dialectic, most topoi are topic-neutral and\nneed hence be selected by certain linguistic, semantic or logical\nfeatures of the given conclusion; if, for example, the conclusion\nmaintains a definition, one has to select a topos from a list\nof topoi pertaining to definitions, etc. Once the\ndialectician or rhetorician has selected a topos that is\nappropriate for a given conclusion, the topos can be used to\nconstrue a premise from which the given conclusion can be derived. If\nfor example the argumentative scheme is \u2018If a predicate is\ngenerally true of a genus, then the predicate is also true of any\nspecies of that genus\u2019, we can derive the conclusion \u2018the\ncapacity of nutrition belongs to plants\u2019 using the premise\n\u2018the capacity of nutrition belongs to all living things\u2019,\nsince \u2018living thing\u2019 is the genus of the species\n\u2018plants\u2019. If the construed premise is accepted, either by\nthe opponent in a dialectical debate or by the audience of a public\nspeech, we can draw the intended conclusion. In the Rhetoric\nthough the situation is slightly different (see below\n \u00a7 7.4),\n because here the topic-neutral type of topoi that was\nprevalent in the Topics seems to play a secondary role. Many\ntopoi of the Rhetoric seem to be rather\n\u2018material\u2019 in the sense that they are only useful for\nestablishing conclusions of a certain content; this is why the\nappropriate topos here cannot be selected by formal criteria,\nbut must be chosen in accordance with the content of the envisaged\nconclusion\u2014whether, for example, something is said to be useful\nor honourable or just, etc.\n\nIt has been disputed whether the topos (or, more precisely,\nthe \u2018if \u2026, then \u2026\u2019 scheme that is included\nin a topos) that we use to construe an argument must itself\nbe regarded as a further premise of the argument. It could be either,\nas some say, the premise of a propositional scheme such as the modus\nponens, or, as others assume, as the conditional premise of a\nhypothetical syllogism. Aristotle himself does not favour one of these\ninterpretations explicitly. But even if he regarded the topoi\nas additional premises in a dialectical or rhetorical argument, it is\nbeyond any doubt that he did not use them as premises that must be\nexplicitly mentioned or even approved by the opponent or audience.\n7.4 Rhetorical Topoi\n\nEven though there are good reasons for thinking that the nature and\nuse of topoi in Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric are based\non his elaborate account of dialectical topoi in the\nTopics (see above\n \u00a7 7.2\n and\n \u00a7 7.3),\n commentators are faced with the difficulty that the use of the word\n\u2018topos\u2019 in Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is\nmuch more heterogeneous than in the Topics. Beside\ntopoi which do perfectly comply with the description given in\nthe Topics, there is an important group of topoi in\nthe Rhetoric that are not topic-neutral and hence do not\ncontain instructions for arguments of a certain logical form, but\nrather with a certain predicate (for example, that something is good,\nor honourable, or just, or contributes to happiness, etc.). While\nthose latter \u2018material\u2019 topoi so to speak are,\nafter all, used to construe arguments, there are also mentions of\nso-called \u2018topoi\u2019 in the context of the\nnon-argumentative means of persuasion, which might be taken as\nprocedural instructions, but no longer seem to be concerned with the\nconstruction of arguments, which was the one and only function of\ndialectical topoi.\n\nSupplement on the Variety of Topoi in the Rhetoric\n\n\nIn addition to the more heterogenous use of the word\n\u2018topos\u2019 in the Rhetoric (which might\noriginate from Aristotle\u2019s attempt to combine his own\ndialectical use of the term with more traditional rhetorical uses),\nthere is the problem of the controversial distinction in\nRhet. I.2, 1358a2\u201335 between topoi (which are\nunderstood to be general/common) on the one hand and certain specific\ndevices (idia) on the other. While Aristotle seems inclined\nto call the general or common topoi simply\n\u2018topoi\u2019, he uses several names for the opposing,\nspecific items (e.g. idiai protaseis, idia,\neid\u00ea). This distinction has a major impact on the\nstructure of the Rhetoric as a whole (see above\n \u00a7 2),\n in that it is responsible for the occurence of \u2018specific\u2019\ninstructions, premises, \u2018topoi\u2019 or whatever in\nthe bulk of the first book and the occurence of \u2018common\u2019\ntopoi in the second part of the second book. Traditionally,\nthis distinction has been understood as a division between\ngeneral/common topoi on the one hand and specific\ntopoi on the other (the traditional view has been defended\namong others by Cope 1877 and Rapp 2002). However, it is unclear (i)\nwhat the opposition between general/common and specific refers to,\n(ii) where in the Rhetoric the common topoi can be\nfound and (iii) whether the distinction is meant to be a distinction\nbetween topoi in the first place, since even though Aristotle\ndistinguishes topoi that are common from specific\n(idia) rhetorical devices, he never explicitly uses the\nphrase \u2018specific topoi\u2019, as one might expect on\nthe traditional reading.\n\nAs for (i), Aristotle points out in Rhet. I.2 that some\nthings are specific to physics, others to ethics, etc. This seems to\nsuggest a distinction between topoi (or other building blocks\nof arguments) that are peculiar to the different sciences on the one\nhand and other topoi that are not, but are instead applicable\nto all sciences and fields of knowledge alike\u2014just as (most of)\nthe dialectical topoi of the Topics are. However,\nfrom Rhet. I.3 on, Aristotle makes the readers think, by\ncontrast, that \u2018specific\u2019 refers to the different genres\nof rhetoric, so that some topoi are specific to deliberative,\nothers to epideictic, and still others to juridical speech.\nCorrespondingly, this would require a sense of\nbeing\u2018common\u2019 that boils down to saying that they are not\nspecific to one single species of speech, but that does not amount to\nthe topic-neutrality of the dialectical topoi.\n\nWith regard to (ii), it is generally agreed that the specific\ntopoi can be found in the first book of the Rhetoric\nand the common topoi in the second. Most commentators assume\nthat all common topoi are listed in chapters II.23\u201324\n(real enthymemes in II.23, fallacious enthymemes in II.24). However,\nit is less common to count the items listed in II.19 (about the\npossible/impossible, past and future facts, significance and\ninsignificance) as common topoi, which might be due to the\ncontroversy mentioned in (i) about the required sense of being\n\u2018common\u2019, for the topoi in II.19 are applicable\nto all genres of speech, but are most probably not common in the way\nthe dialectical topoi are. In addition, it is important to\nnotice that even chapter II.23, which is undisputedly dedicated to\ncommon topoi, is a mixed bag, for it includes some\ntopoi, especially in the first third of the chapter, that,\nbeing topic-neutral, thoroughly correspond to dialectical\ntopoi and even might be generally applicable as the\ndialectical topoi are, while some other topoi\nmentioned in II.23 are quite different in style, as they are taken\nfrom extant historical speeches.\n\nThe most difficult debates are posed by (iii), as the traditional\ninterpretation is based on some fragile assumptions. Not only does\nAristotle never call the specific items \u2018topoi\u2019\nby name, it is also significant that the specific items that are\nlisted in Rhet. I.5-15 often have the form of mere\npropositions or premises rather than of topoi as we know them\nfrom the Topics (see above\n \u00a7 7.3).\n This is why several authors insist that the distinction between\ntopoi, which are thought to be common, and idia is\nnot a distinction between different types of topoi, but\nbetween topoi and something else, most notably premises,\ncommonly accepted premises or premises established by the arts. This\nobjection comes in several versions. (a) Several authors subscribed to\nthe view of Solmsen 1929 that there are two types of enthymemes,\nrespresenting different stages in the development of Aristotle\u2019s\nlogical thinking insofar as some are taken from topoi\n(deriving from Aristotle\u2019s early- pre-syllogistic logic) and\nsome are built from premises through the figures of the syllogism\n(thus presupposing syllogistic logic), not from topoi.\nAccording to this view, the specific topoi given in the first\nbook of the Rhetoric are the premises of the latter type of\nenthymemes, and the enthymemes of the former type are taken only from\ncommon topoi. From this point of view, only common\ntopoi would be topoi in the proper sense, while\nspecific topoi would be, strictly speaking, nothing but\npremises. Accordingly, one would expect to find propositions of the\nform \u201cAll F are just/noble/good\u201d in the first\nbook of the Rhetoric; with such propositions one could\nconstrue syllogisms like \u201cAll F are\njust/noble/good\u2014This particular x is\nF\u2014This particular x is just/noble/good.\u201d\nAgainst Solmsen it has been objected that what one actually gets in\nthe first book hardly fits Solmsen\u2019s model. In some sense one\nfinds more than the required premises in that Aristotle gives here not\nonly isolated propositions, but also certain propositions together\nwith a reason or a justification. Furthermore, chapters I.6\u20137 of\nthe Rhetoric offer topoi which can also be found in\nthe third book of Topics; in the Topics they are\nclearly called \u2018topoi\u2019, so that there is less\npressure to think that they are premises rather than topoi.\n(b) Grimaldi 1958 requires that in order to build a rhetorical\nargument one needs the logical form of an argument provided by the\ntopoi plus the material (content) provided by the specific\npremises or idia. A more refined version of this\n\u2018complementarity\u2019-view has been suggested by Rubinelli\n2009, who, however, also allows of the possibility that some\nenthymemes are taken only from the topoi, while others are\nonly taken from the idia. Against Grimaldi\u2019s view it is\nhas been objected that many of the common topoi listed in\nchapters II.23\u201324 are not based on linguistic, semantic or\nlogical categories as the topic-neutral topoi of the\nTopics are. Some of them only offer strategic advice, for\nexample, to turn what has been said against oneself upon the one who\nsaid it. For this reason, it would be misleading to interpret the\ncommon topoi of the Rhetoric as providing logical\nschemes of inference. (c) Havrda 2019 has attacked the presuppositions\nof the traditional view, but does not settle for the alternatives\nsuggested by Solmsen, Grimaldi or Rubinelli either. According to him,\nAristotle never distinguishes between common and specific\ntopoi. Rather, he distinguishes between two different sources\nof rhetorical deductions; one source, the dialectical one, uses\ntopoi, while the other, which is based on definitions\nprovided by arts and sciences, does not.\n8. Style: How to Say Things with Words\n\nRhet. III.1\u201312 introduces the topic of lexis,\nusually translated as \u2018style\u2019. This topic was not\nannounced until the final passage of Rhetoric II, so that\nmost scholars have come to think of this section as a more or less\nself-contained treatise. The insertion of this treatise into the\nRhetoric is motivated by the claim that, while\nRhetoric I & II dealt with thought (dianoia), i.e., about\nwhat the orator should say, it remains to inquire into the\nvarious ways of saying or formulating one and the same thing. In the\ncourse of Rhetoric III.1\u201312 it turns out that Aristotle\ntackles this task by using some quite heterogeneous approaches. After\nan initial exploration of the field of delivery and style (III.1)\nAristotle tries to determine what good prose style consists in; for\nthis purpose he has to go into the differentiation and the selection\nof various kinds of nouns, one of which is defined as metaphor\n(III.2). The following chapters III.3\u20136 feature topics that are\nat best loosely connected with the theme of good prose style; among\nthese topics is the opposite of good style, namely frigid or deterring\nstyle (psuchron) (III.3), the simile, which turns out to be\nconnected with the metaphor (III.4), the issue of correct Greek\n(III.5), the appropriateness (III.7) and the means by which\none\u2019s style becomes long-winded and dignified (III.6). Chapters\nIII.8\u20139 introduce two new approaches to the issue of style,\nwhich seem to be unrelated to everything that has been said so far:\nThese are the topics of the rhythmical shaping of prose style and of\nperiodic and non-periodic flow of speech. Chapters III.10\u201311 are\ndedicated to how the orator can \u2018bring things before one\u2019s\neyes\u2019, which amounts to something like making the style more\nvivid. Again metaphors are shown to play a crucial role for that\npurpose, so that the topic of metaphor is taken up again and deepened\nby extended lists of examples. Chapter III.12 seems to make a new\nstart by distinguishing between oral and written style and assessing\ntheir suitability for the three genres of speech (see above\n \u00a72).\n The philosophical core of Aristotle\u2019s treatise on style in\nRhetoric III.1\u201312 seems to be included in the\ndiscussion of the good prose style (see below\n \u00a78.1),\n however it is the topic of metaphor (see below\n \u00a78.2)\n that has attracted the most attention in the later reception up to\nthe present day.\n8.1 The Virtue of Style\n\nOriginally the discussion of style belongs to the art of poetry rather\nthan to rhetoric; the poets were the first, as Aristotle observes, to\ngive an impulse for the study of style. Nevertheless he admits that\nquestions of style or, more precisely, of different ways to formulate\nthe same subject, may have an impact on the degree of clarity:\n\u201cWhat concerns the topic of lexis, however, has some\nsmall necessary place in all teaching; for to speak in one way rather\nthan another makes some difference in regard to clarity; although not\na great difference\u2026\u201d (Rhet. III.1,\n1404a8\u201310). Clarity again matters for comprehension and\ncomprehensibility contributes to persuasiveness. Indeed Aristotle even\nclaims that the virtue or excellence (aret\u00ea) of prose\nstyle ultimately depends on clarity, because it is the genuine purpose\nof a speech is to make something clear. In prose speeches, the good\nformulation of a state of affairs must therefore be a clear one.\nHowever, saying this is not yet enough to account for the best or\nexcellent prose style, since clear linguistic expressions tend to be\nbanal or flat, while good style should avoid such banality. If the\nlanguage becomes too banal it will not be able to attract the\nattention of the audience. The orator can avoid this tendency of\nbanality by the use of dignified or elevated expressions and in\ngeneral by all formulations that deviate from common usage. On the one\nhand, uncommon vocabulary has the advantage of evoking the curiosity\nof an audience. On the other hand the use of such elevated vocabulary\nbears a serious risk: Whenever the orator makes excessive use of it,\nthe speech might become unclear, thus failing to meet the default\nrequirement of prose speech, namely clarity. Moreover, if the\nvocabulary becomes too sublime or dignified in relation to\nprose\u2019s subject matter (Aristotle assumes it is mostly everyday\naffairs), the audience will notice that the orator uses his words with\na certain intention and will become suspicious about the orator and\nhis intentions. Hitting upon the right wording is therefore a matter\nof being clear, but not too banal; In trying not to be too banal, one\nmust use uncommon, dignified words and phrases, but one must be\ncareful not to use them excessively or inappropriately in relation to\nprose style and the typical subject matter of prose speeches.\n\nBringing all these considerations together, Aristotle defines the good\nprose style, i.e. the virtue of prose style, as follows: \u201cLet\nthe virtue of linguistic form be defined as being clear, for since the\nlogos is a (linguistic, sc.) sign, it would fail to bring about its\nproper function, whenever it does not make clear (whatever it is the\nsign of, sc.)\u2014and neither banal/mean/flat\n(tapein\u00ean) nor above the deserved dignity, but\nappropriate (prepon)\u201d (Rhet. III.2,\n1404b1\u20134; similar at III.12, 1414a22\u201326). According to this\ndefinition, the virtue of prose style has to avoid two opposed\ntendencies, both of which are excessive and therefore fallacious: The\ngood style is clear in a way that is neither too banal nor too\ndignified, but appropriate (in proportion to the subject matter of\nprose speech). In this respect the definition of stylistic virtue\nfollows the same scheme as the definition of ethical virtues in\nAristotle\u2019s ethical writings, insofar as both the stylistic\nvirtue and the virtue of character are defined in terms of a mean that\nlies between two opposed excesses. If the virtue of style is defined\nas a mean between the banality involving form of clarity and overly\ndignified (and hence inappropriate) speech, it is with good reason\nthat Aristotle speaks of only one virtue of prose style, and not of\nclarity, ornament (by dignified expressions) and appropriateness as\nthree distinct virtues of style. However, from the times of Cicero and\nQuintilianus on, these three, along with the correctness of Greek or\nLatin, became the canonical four virtues of speech (virtutes\ndicendi). Reading Aristotle through the spectacles of the Roman\nart of rhetoric, scholars often try to identify two, three or four\nvirtues of style in his Rhetoric.\n\nFinally, if the virtue of style is about finding a balance between\nbanal clarity, which is dull, and attractive dignity, which is\ninappropriate in public speeches, how can the orator manage to control\nthe different degrees of clarity and dignity? For this purpose\nAristotle equips the orator with a classification of words (more or\nless the same classification can also be found in Poetics\nchapter 21): First of all Aristotle distinguishes between the\nkuria onamata, the standard expressions, and the\ngl\u00f4tta, the borrowed words, idioms or vernacular\nexpressions. Most examples that Aristotle gives of this latter class\nare taken from the different Greek dialects, and most examples of this\ntype are in turn taken from the language of the Homeric epos. Further\nclasses are defined by metaphors and by several expressions that are\nsomehow altered or modified, e.g., newly coined expressions\n(pepoi\u00eamena), composite expressions (especially new or\nunusual compositions (ta dipla)), and lengthened, shortened\nor otherwise altered expressions. Sometimes Aristotle also uses the\nterm kosmos under which he collects all epithets and\notherwise ornamental expressions. These different types of words\ndiffer in accordance with their familiarity. Most familiar are the\nusual or current words, the least familiar words are the\ngl\u00f4tta or words that are newly coined. The metaphors\nare also unknown and unusual, because a usual, well-known word is used\nto designate something other than its usual designation (see below\n \u00a78.2).\n The best established words, the kuria, make their subject\nclear, but do not excite the audience\u2019s curiosity, whereas all\nother types of words are not established, and hence have the sort of\nattraction that alien or foreign things used to have. Since remote\nthings are admirable (thaumaston) and the admirable is\npleasant, Aristotle says, one should make the speech admirable and\npleasant by the use of such unfamiliar words. However one has to be\ncareful not to use inappropriately dignified or poetic words in prose\nspeech. Thus the virtue of style is accomplished by the selection and\nbalanced use of these various types of words: Fundamental for prose\nspeech is the use of usual and therefore clear words. In order to make\nthe speech pleasant and dignified and in order to avoid banality the\norator must make moderate use of non-familiar elements. Metaphor plays\nan important role for prose style, since metaphors contribute, as\nAristotle says, clarity as well as the unfamiliar, surprising effect\nthat avoids banality and tediousness.\n8.2 Aristotelian Metaphors\n\nAccording to Aristotle Poetics 21, 1457b9\u201316 and\n20\u201322, a metaphor is \u201cthe application of an alien name by\ntransference either from genus to species, or from species to genus,\nor from species to species, or by analogy, that is, proportion\u201d.\nThese four types are exemplified as follows:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nType\nExample\nExplanation \n\n(i)\nFrom genus to species\nThere lies my ship\nLying at anchor is a species of the\ngenus \u201clying\u201d \n\n(ii)\nFrom species to genus\nVerily ten thousand noble deeds hath\nOdysseus wrought\nTen thousand is a species of the\ngenus \u201clarge number\u201d \n\n(iii)\nFrom species to species\n(a) With blade of bronze drew away\nthe life\n(a) \u201cTo draw away\u201d is\nused for \u201cto cleave\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(b) Cleft the water with the vessel\nof unyielding bronze\n(b) \u201cTo cleave\u201d is used\nfor \u201cto draw away.\u201d Both, to draw away and to cleave, are\nspecies of \u201ctaking away\u201d \n\n(iv)\nFrom analogy\n(a) To call the cup \u201cthe shield\nof Dionysus\u201d\n(a) The cup is to Dionysus as the\nshield to Ares \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(b) To call the shield \u201cthe cup\nof Ares\u201d\n(b) The shield is to Ares as the cup to Dionysus \n\n\n\nMost of the examples Aristotle offers for types (i) to (iii) would not\nbe regarded as metaphors in the modern sense; rather they would fall\nunder the headings of metonomy or synecdoche. The examples offered for\ntype (iv) are more like modern metaphors. Aristotle himself regards\nthe metaphors of group (iv), which are built from analogy, as the most\nimportant type of enthymemes. An analogy is given if the second term\nis to the first as the fourth to the third. Correspondingly, an\nanalogous metaphor uses the fourth term for the second or the second\nfor the fourth. This principle can be illustrated by the following\nAristotelian examples:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAnalogy\nMetaphor \n\n(a)\nThe cup to Dionysus as shield to\nAres.\nTo call the cup \u201cthe shield of\nDionysus\u201d or the shield \u201cthe cup of Ares\u201d is a\nmetaphor. \n\n(b)\nOld age to life as the evening to\nday\nTo call old age \u201cthe evening of\nthe life\u201d or the evening \u201cold age of the day\u201d is a\nmetaphor \n\n(c)\nSowing to seed as X to sun\nrays, while the action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless;\nstill this process bears to the sun the same relation as sowing to the\nseed.\nTo call (a nameless) X\n\u201csowing of sun rays\u201d is a metaphor by analogy \n\n(d)\n= (a)\nTo call the shield \u201ca cup\nwithout wine\u201d is also a metaphor by analogy.  \n\n\nExamples (a) and (b) obey the optional instruction that metaphors can\nbe qualified by adding the term to which the proper word is relative\n(cp. \u201cthe shield of Ares,\u201d \u201cthe evening\nof life\u201d). In example (c), there is no proper name for\nthe thing that the metaphor refers to. In example (d) the relation of\nanalogy is not, as in the other cases, indicated by the domain to\nwhich an item is referred to, but by a certain negation (for example\n\u201cwithout name\u201d); the negations make clear that the term is\nnot used in its usual sense.\n\nMetaphors are closely related to similes; but as opposed to the later\ntradition, Aristotle does not define the metaphor as an abbreviated\nsimile, but, the other way around, the simile as a metaphor. The\nsimile differs from the metaphor in the form of expression: while in\nthe metaphor something is identified or substituted, the simile\ncompares two things with each other, using words as\n\u201clike,\u201d \u201cas\u201d, etc. For example, \u201cHe\nrushed as a lion\u201d is, according to Aristotle, a simile, but\n\u201cThe lion rushed\u201d is a metaphor.\n\nWhile in the later tradition the use of metaphors has been seen as a\nmatter of mere decoration, which has to delight the hearer, Aristotle\nstresses the cognitive function of metaphors. Metaphors, he says,\nbring about learning (Rhet. III.10, 1410b14f.). In order to\nunderstand a metaphor, the hearer has to find something common between\nthe metaphor and the thing the metaphor refers to. For example, if\nsomeone calls the old age \u201cstubble\u201d, we have to find a\ncommon genus to which old age and stubble belong; we do not grasp the\nvery sense of the metaphor until we find that both, old age and\nstubble, have lost their bloom. Thus, a metaphor not only refers to a\nthing, but simultaneously describes the thing in a certain respect.\nThis is why Aristotle says that the metaphor brings about learning: as\nsoon as we understand why someone uses the metaphor\n\u201cstubble\u201d to refer to old age, we have learned at least\none characteristic of old age.\nGlossary of Selected Terms\n\nAccepted opinions: endoxa\nArgument: logos\nArt: techn\u00ea\nCharacter: \u00eathos\nCounterpart: antistrophos\nCredible: axiopistos\nDecision (practical): prohairesis\nDeduction: sullogismos\nEmotions: path\u00ea\nEnthymeme: enthum\u00eama\nExample: paradeigma\nFor the most part: h\u00f4s epi to polu\nInduction (epag\u00f4g\u00ea)\nJudgement: krisis\nLocation: topos (an argumentative scheme)\nMaxim: gn\u00f4m\u00ea\nMeans of persuasion: pistis (in pre-Aristotelian use this\nword also designates a certain part of the speech)\nMetaphor: metaphora\nPersuasive: pithanon\nPlace: topos (an argumentative scheme)\nPractical intelligence: phron\u00easis\nPremise: protasis (can also mean \u2018sentence\u2019,\nstatement\u2019)\nProbable: eikos\nProof: apodeixis (in the sense of \u2018demonstrative\nargument, demonstration\u2019)\nProof: tekm\u00earion (i.e. a necessary sign or sign\nargument)\nSign: s\u00eameion (can also mean \u2018sign\nargument\u2019)\nStyle: lexis\nSpecific topoi: idioi topoi (Aristotle\nrefers to them also by \u2018idiai protaseis\u2019 or\n\u2018eid\u00ea\u2019)\n\n",
