    "main_text": "Ethics: Norms and Values || Mally\u2019s background and development in ethics\n3.2 Mally\u2019s background and development in ethics\n\n\nIt seems justified to distinguish three phases of Mally\u2019s work on\nvalue theory and ethics:\n\n\n(1) The early period until 1923 is influenced and coined by\nMeinong\u2019s philosophy. Two years after Meinong\u2019s death, Mally edited\nMeinong\u2019s On the Foundation of a General Theory of Values (Meinong\n1923a). In his short preface to this volume, Mally points out that he\ndoes not see any reason to change or complement Meinong\u2019s text. In\nother words, this ethical point of view is molded by Meinong\u2019s value\nobjectivism: values exist independently of value experiences. Just as\nsensations are the basis of perceptual judgments, evaluations are the\nbasis of value judgments. The value of an object triggers, via\nemotional presentation (Meinong), a certain value experience or value\nfeeling in the subject. Mally accepted not only Meinong\u2019s distinction\nbetween object and objective but also the distinction between\ndignitative (object based on feeling) and desiderative (object based on\nwilling). To the class of dignitatives, Meinong counted the classical\ntriad of true, good and beautiful (maybe even pleasant) (Meinong 1923b,\n120; see also the excellent summary of Meinong\u2019s value philosophy from\na modern point of view in Reicher 2009: 114 ff.). Mally continued his\ninvestigations in value theory on this foundation of the\n natural law tradition in ethics\n (Wolf 1952b; see also below 3.3.1).\n\n\n(2) Mally has then developed his own views on value theory and ethics,\npartly based on Meinong but also with reference to his contemporaries,\nethicists like Max Scheler and Nicolai Hartmann. He offered his views\nin a lecture on \u201cValue Theory and Ethics\u201d in 1924/25 and\nthen again in a reviewed and expanded version in 1926/27. This seems\nto be of central importance for Mally\u2019s work on deontic logic which he\nelaborated at the same time, most probably between 1924 and 1926\n(Mally 1926). It was Melanie Sagheb-Oehlinger who looked through the\nunpublished work of Ernst Mally. She retyped and edited this lecture\nmanuscript\u2014originally typed by Mokre (1927)\u2014as an\nAppendix to her master\u2019s thesis (Sagheb-Oehlinger 2008).  It\noffers an extensive outline of Mally\u2019s philosophical approach to value\ntheory and ethics, of course in the broad tradition of Franz Brentano\nand Alexius Meinong. What is described below is mainly based on this\nAppendix.\n\n\n(3) In the 1930s, Mally further developed his philosophy of reality\n(Mally 1935). Although it seems he had some ethical consequences of\nthis \u201crealistic approach\u201d in mind, he did not elaborate\nthem beyond this book. He even mentioned explicitly in his article on\ntruth (Mally 1940) that he has left aside questions of the\nnormative.\n",
