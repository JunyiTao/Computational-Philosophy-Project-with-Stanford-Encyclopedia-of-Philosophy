    "main_text": "The role of decoherence\n10. The role of decoherence\n\nAccording to the environment-induced approach to decoherence (Zurek\n1981, 2003; see also Schlosshauer 2007), any macroscopic measuring\napparatus is an open system in continuous interaction with its\nenvironment; as a consequence of this interaction, the reduced state\nof the apparatus becomes, almost instantaneously, indistinguishable\nfrom a state that would represent an ignorance mixture (\u201cproper\nmixture\u201d) over unknown but definite positions of the\napparatus\u2019 macroscopic pointer. The idea that decoherence might\nplay an important role in modal interpretations, by making macroscopic\nquantities definite, was suggested by several authors early on (Dieks\n1989, Healey 1995). Consideration of decoherence has acquired central\nrelevance in the discussion of non-ideal measurements.\n\nAs we have seen, in BDMI and SDMI, the biorthogonal and spectral\ndecompositions do generally not pick out the right properties for the\napparatus in non-ideal measurements. However, Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo\n(1996) show that, when the apparatus is a finite-dimensional system in\ninteraction with an environment containing a large number of degrees\nof freedom, decoherence guarantees that the spectral decomposition of\nthe reduced apparatus\u2019 state will be very close to the ideally\nexpected result and, as a consequence, an observable very close to and\nindistinguishable from the apparatus pointer will be selected as\ndefinite-valued. Alternatively, Bub (1997) suggests that instead of\ndecoherence\u2014with the \u201ctracing out\u201d of the\nenvironment and the diagonalization of the reduced state of the\napparatus\u2014the triorthogonal or \\(n\\)-orthogonal decomposition\ntheorem involving the environment may be used to single out a unique\npointer basis for the apparatus.\n\nIn either case, interaction with the environment solves the problem of\nnon-ideal measurements in BDMI and SDMI for the case of\nfinite-dimensional macroscopic apparatuses. However, the case of\ninfinitely many distinct states for the apparatus is more\ntroublesome. Bacciagaluppi (2000) has analyzed this situation, using a\ncontinuous model of the apparatus\u2019 interaction with the\nenvironment. He concludes that in this case the spectral decomposition\nof the reduced state of the apparatus generally does not pick out\nproperties that are close enough to empirically required ones. This\nresult seems to apply generally to cases where a macroscopic system\nwith infinitely many degrees of freedom experiences decoherence due to\ninteraction with its environment (see Donald 1998). However, model\ncalculations by Hollowood (2013, 2014) indicate that the problem may\nbe less severe in realistic circumstances than originally supposed,\nand the issue needs further investigation.\n\nModal interpretations with an a priori fixed preferred observable\n(MHI, and Bohm\u2019s interpretation) are immune to the above\nobjections: decoherence by the environment need not be invoked in\norder to account for the definiteness of the apparatus\u2019 pointer\nposition (neither in ideal nor in non-ideal measurements). However, in\nMHI there still is a relation with the decoherence program. In fact,\nthe measuring apparatus is always a macroscopic system with a huge\nnumber of degrees of freedom, and the pointer must therefore be a\n\u201ccollective\u201d and empirically accessible observable; as a\nconsequence, the many degrees of freedom \u2014and the corresponding\ndegeneracies\u2014 of the pointer play the role of a decohering\n\u201cinternal environment\u201d (for details, see Lombardi et\nal. 2011). The role of decoherence in the MHI becomes clearer when the\nphenomenon of decoherence is understood from a closed-system\nperspective (Castagnino, Fortin, and Lombardi 2010).
