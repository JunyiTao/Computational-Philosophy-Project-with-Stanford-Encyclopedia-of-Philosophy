    "main_text": "Some Views on God and Time || Divine Temporality\n4.2 Divine Temporality\n\nIn recent times, there has been a notable shift away from divine\ntimelessness. There are many different kinds of views that fall under\nthe heading of divine temporality; many of these could also be\nclassified as \u201cintermediate\u201d views. As in 4.1, the list is\nof course far from exhaustive.\n\nNote that while Open Theism has been part of the shift away from\ndivine timelessness, the position arises specifically in relation to\nthe topic of divine foreknowledge. Open Theism says that God does not\nknow which choices we will freely make in the future, because there is\nnothing yet to be known; here, free choice is understood along\nlibertarian lines and the future is taken to be genuinely open in some\nmetaphysically significant sense. For more on Open Theism, see\nPinnock et al. 1994, Zimmerman 2010, Rice 2020, Rissler (Other\nInternet Resources), and the SEP entry on\ndivine foreknowledge.\n\n4.2.1 Pure Temporalism\n\nOn this view, God is located at all times, God experiences succession,\nand God has lived through and will live through a non-finite past and\nfuture. The idea here is that God is in (our, physical)\ntime/spacetime, and God is a temporal being in just the way we are,\nexcept that the temporal extent of God\u2019s life is infinite.\nCompared to other temporal views, this one is conceptually\nstraightforward. Arguably, however, it is in tension with current\ncosmology, which suggests that the universe has a finite past. Insofar\nas the view implies that God is bound by, or has no power over time,\nit may also be at odds with some of the constraints arising from\nWestern Scripture (see\n section 2).\n The view is found at least in process theologians like Charles\nHartshorne (Hartshorne 1947).\n4.2.2 Relative Timelessness\n\nOn Alan Padgett\u2019s view, God changes, so God is temporal.\nHowever, timelessness is not abandoned; instead, it is redefined. \n\n\n[\u2026] I have not abandoned timelessness. Instead, I have\nredefined \u201cGod is timeless\u201d to mean that God is relatively\ntimeless, i.e. he is not measured by time nor is he affected by the\nnegative aspects of temporal passage. (Padgett 1992: 146; also 2001)\n\n\n\nThe idea is that God\u2019s time is non-identical with our,\n\u201cMeasured Time\u201d.\n\n\u201cMeasured Time\u201d is \u201cthe specifically human time of\nour history and our universe: the time of seconds, days, and\ncenturies; the time of our space-time\u201d (Padgett 1992: 130). In\nthat sense of \u201ctime\u201d, God is timeless. However, God is not\ntimeless in the strict sense in which \u201ctime\u201d refers to any\nkind of temporality, because God is in his own time. Does that mean\nGod is only in his time and not in ours? No, he is in our time too (p.\n131\u2014at least saying this is \u201cphilosophically\nacceptable\u201d (p. 126)), as we are in his. It\u2019s just that he\ntranscends our time. What does it mean to transcend our time? It means\nthat God is the ground of time, that he is not negatively affected by\nthe passage of time, and (things get a little circular here), that he\nis relatively timeless.\n\nOne question one might have about this is what \u201cMeasured\nTime\u201d and \u201cGod\u2019s time\u201d are, and how plausible\nit is to think there are both. Padgett maintains that in everyday\nspeech, \u201ctime\u201d refers \u201cnot to an ontological\ncategory\u201d but to \u201cthe human time of our history and our\nuniverse\u201d (1992: 130). The distinction is supported by appeals\nto the differences between this sense of \u201ctime\u201d and\n\u201cthe strict ontological sense of \u2018time\u2019 used in\nphilosophy\u201d (p. 140). But this may still leave one wondering\nabout the distinction. For one thing, few contemporary ontologists\ntake themselves to be investigating a time distinct from \u201cthe\nhuman time of our history and our universe\u201d. Nor do they tend to\nthink of the time of the universe as specifically human. For another,\nthere are a number of different philosophical views about time.\n4.2.3 Timeless Without and Temporal With Creation\n\nWilliam Lane Craig\u2019s view is that God is timeless without\ncreation, and temporal with creation (Craig 2000). God exists\ntimelessly \u201cwithout\u201d creation rather than before creation,\nbecause there isn\u2019t literally a before. And so it can\u2019t\nliterally be the case that God becomes temporal, since becoming\nanything involves being first one thing and then the other.\nNonetheless, God is \u201ctimeless without creation and temporal\nsubsequent to creation \u201d, God \u201centers time at the moment\nof creation\u201d (Craig 2000: 33). God exists changelessly and\ntimelessly, but by creating, God undergoes an extrinsic change\n\u201cwhich draws Him into time\u201d (Craig 2000: 29).\n\nThe problem is that even extrinsic change still presupposes a before\nand after (Leftow 2005: 66). Craig is aware of the difficulty: \n\n\n[O]n such a view, there seem to be two phases of God\u2019s life, a\ntimeless phase and a temporal phase, and the timeless phase seems to\nhave existed earlier than the temporal phase. But this is logically\nincoherent, since to stand in a relation of  earlier than  is by all\naccounts to be temporal. (Craig 2000: 32) \n\n\nHis solution is \n\n\nthat \u201cprior\u201d to creation there literally are no intervals\nof time [\u2026] no earlier and later, no enduring through\nsuccessive intervals and, hence, no waiting, no temporal becoming.\nThis state would pass away, not successively, but as a whole, at the\nmoment of creation, when time begins. \n\n\nAnd this state, he says, \u201clooks suspiciously like a state of\ntimelessness\u201d (Craig 2000: 33).\n\nBut this solution looks suspiciously like a re-statement of the view.\nThe problem was that we could only talk of a \u201cbefore\u201d in\nquotation marks. Yet we needed there to literally be such a before on\nthe view in question. (This is unless we decline to make literal sense\nof all this, but that is not Craig\u2019s approach.) What can it mean\nto say God underwent a change at the end of which God was temporal?\nCraig\u2019s answer seems to be that there is timelessness before\ntime\u2019s beginning, or rather, \u201cbefore\u201d time\u2019s\nbeginning.\n\nCraig endorses Padgett\u2019s distinction between \u201cMeasured\nTime\u201d and \u201cOntological Time\u201d (God\u2019s time).\nUnlike Padgett, he identifies the latter with Newton\u2019s absolute\ntime. He defends a \u201cneo-Lorentzian\u201d interpretation of\nspecial relativity, according to which there is a privileged reference\nframe that is in principle undetectable due to the effective Lorentz\ninvariance of the dynamical laws. In addition, he points to the cosmic\ntime of some general relativistic spacetime models as a candidate for\nabsolute time. Each of these claims is made in support of a strong\nprior commitment to the A-theory, shared with Padgett. However, each\nclaim faces problems, and their connection is unclear, since the\n\u201cneo-Lorentzian\u201d approach to special relativity\ndoesn\u2019t allow for as natural a development in the direction of\ngeneral relativity as does the standard approach (see, e.g., Balashov\n& Janssen 2003, W\u00fcthrich 2013).\n\nCraig and Padgett differ over whether cosmic time gives a\n\u201cproper measure\u201d of God\u2019s time, and thus effectively\nover whether, on this kind of view, we have any epistemic access to\nGod\u2019s time (which we are also in). Craig answers in the\naffirmative, but still hesitates to identify cosmic time with\nGod\u2019s time, preferring instead to say that the two\n\u201ccoincide\u201d (Craig 1990: 344).\n4.2.4 Metrically Amorphous Time\n\nRichard Swinburne originally defends timelessness (Swinburne 1965),\nbut then switches allegiance to a temporal view. According to his\nlater view, before creation God lives alone in a metrically amorphous\ntime (Swinburne 1977, 1993, 1994). (Padgett also describes God\u2019s\ntime as metrically amorphous.) Once God creates the world and\ninstitutes the laws of nature, time acquires a metric. There then\nbegin to be facts of the matter about how long temporal intervals\nare.\n\nFurther Reading: \n\nDefenses of Divine Timelessness: Helm 1988, 2001; Yates 1990;\nRogers 2000, 2007; Dolezal 2017; Duby 2022.\nDefenses of Divine Temporality: Lucas 1973, 1989; Wolterstorff\n1975, 2000a,b, 2001; Hasker 1989, 2002; Zimmerman 2002; DeWeese 2002,\n2004; Mullins 2016.\n\n5. Arguments against Divine Timelessness\n5.1 Arguments from Divine Omniscience and Tensed Facts\n\nRecall that the theistic God is omniscient. Presumably then, God knows\nwhat temporal reality is like at its most fundamental. If there are\nfundamental tensed facts (like that it\u2019s 12:00), God knows them.\nBut since these facts change, what God knows changes constantly. So\nGod changes constantly; so God is in time.\n\nArgument 1\n\n(1)\nGod is omniscient.\n(2)\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows the fundamental temporal\nfacts.\nSo (3)\nGod knows the fundamental temporal facts. (From (1), (2))\nSo (4)\nif there are fundamental tensed facts (i.e. the A-theory is true),\nthen God knows them. (From (3))\n(5)\nIf God knows fundamental tensed facts, then what God knows\nchanges.\n(6)\nIf what God knows changes, then God changes.\n(7)\nIf God changes, then God is temporal.\n\n\nTherefore, if the A-theory is true, then God is temporal. (From (4),\n(5), (6), (7))\n\n\nVarious versions of this argument have been defended (Craig 2000,\n2001; DeWeese 2004; Hasker 2002; Kretzmann 1966; Padgett 1992, 2001;\nWolterstorff 1975; Mullins 2016: Ch. 4). Since many participants of\nthe debate think the A-theory is true, it is treated as an argument\nfor divine temporality. In response, advocates of timelessness\nchallenge one or more of the argument\u2019s premises (Wierenga 1989,\n2002; Alston 1989a; Ganssle 1993, 1995, 2002). Others respond by giving up\non the A-theory and accepting the B-theory (Helm 1988, 2001; Rogers\n2000). The thought is that this argument can\u2019t be run for the\nB-theory, since on the B-theory, the fundamental (tenseless) temporal\nfacts don\u2019t change. The parallel argument would get stuck at the\nanalogue of step (5): it\u2019s not the case that if God knows\nfundamental tenseless facts, then what God knows changes. So while the\nargument itself is silent on whether the B-theory allows one to\ncombine timelessness with omniscience, part of the point of making it\nis that the parallel argument can\u2019t be run for the B-theory.\n\nOne might, however, wonder whether there are arguments in the vicinity\nof Argument 1 that can be run on the B-theory too. Consider first the\nfollowing, somewhat similar argument.\n\nArgument 2\n\n(1\u2032)\nGod is omniscient.\n(2\u2032)\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows what time it is.\nSo (3\u2032)\nGod knows what time it is. (From (1\u2032), (2\u2032))\n(4\u2032)\nWhat time it is changes.\nSo (5\u2032)\nWhat God knows changes. (From (3\u2032), (4\u2032))\n(6)\nIf what God knows changes, then God changes.\n(7)\nIf God changes, then God is temporal.\n\n\nTherefore, God is temporal. (From (5\u2032), (6), (7))\n\n\nUnlike in the case of Argument 1, the connection to the A-theory here\nis not straightforward. There is certainly a sense in which (4\u2032)\nis true on the B-theory, even though there is, on the B-theory, no\nchange in the fundamental temporal facts. At each time, that time is\npresent\u2014not in the absolute, metaphysically privileged sense of\nthe A-theory, but in a relative, perspectival sense. Each time is\npresent at itself, just like each spatial location is here relative to\nitself. Moreover, on a standard B-theoretic account of tensed language\n(e.g., Mozersky 2015; but see Torre 2010 for an alternative account),\nat each of those times, a temporal subject S can know, and have\na true belief about, what time it is. At noon, S believes that\nit is noon; that belief is made true by a tenseless fact, such as that\nS holds the belief at (a time simultaneous with) noon. At\n12:01, S believes truly that it is 12:01, where this belief is\nmade true by another tenseless fact, such as that this later belief is\nheld by S at (a time simultaneous with) 12:01, and so on.\n\nAdmittedly, it is not the case, on this B-theoretic account, that knowing\nwhat time it is (at different times) involves knowing different things\nat different times. The reason is that the tenseless contents that are\nbelieved can be believed by S at all times equally (and typically\nwill be). So while, at each time, S has a tensed belief with a\ntenseless content that differs from the tenseless content of\nS\u2019s tensed beliefs at previous times, S may not\ncome to believe, or know, anything new. This suggests that the same\napplies to God, and that (5\u2032) doesn\u2019t follow from\n(3\u2032) and (4\u2032).\n\nHowever, what matters is not just what S knows and\nbelieves, but how S knows and believes it. Tensed\nbeliefs have rather different cognitive significance from the\ncorresponding tenseless ones. What matters for timely action is\nbelieving the tenseless content via a tensed representation, by having\na true tensed belief (\u201cit is noon (now)\u201d). The point is a\nmore general one that applies equally to indexicals other than\n\u201cnow\u201d, such as \u201cI\u201d or \u201chere\u201d: the\ncognitive significance of indexical beliefs differs from that of the\ncorresponding non-indexical ones.\n\nTherefore, if a B-theoretic subject S knows (at more than one\ntime) what time it is, then they undergo changes. The reason is that\nhow they believe what they believe changes. They need to keep track of\ntheir temporal perspective by having appropriately varied tensed\nbeliefs (\u201cit\u2019s noon\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s\n12:01\u201d). At least this is so for anyone whose temporal nature\nrelevantly resembles our own. Does this group include God? If so, then\non the B-theory too, there is reason to worry about the combination of\nomniscience with timelessness.\n\nArgument 3\n\n(1\u2032)\nGod is omniscient.\n(2\u2032)\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows what time it is.\nSo (3\u2032)\nGod knows what time it is. (From (1\u2032), (2\u2032))\n(4\u2033)\nIf S knows what time it is, then how S believes\n(what S believes) changes.\n(5\u2033)\nHow God believes (what God believes) changes. (From (3\u2032),\n(4\u2033))\n(6\u2033)\nIf how God believes changes, then God changes.\n(7)\nIf God changes, then God is temporal.\n\n\nTherefore, God is temporal. (From (5\u2033), (6\u2033), (7))\n\n5.2 Arguments from Divine Action\n\nOne might reason as follows. When God creates the universe, God begins\nto stand in the relation of coexisting with to the universe,\nand also in the relation of sustaining it in existence.\nAcquiring these and other relations to the universe makes God\ntemporal, because it constitutes a change that God undergoes at the\nmoment of creation. Even if God was timeless before, God is temporal\nafter creation (Craig 2009).\n\nThe problem with this line of thought is again that it is not clear\nhow to understand the notions of before and after, of acquiring, and\nof beginning, as applied to a timeless God.\n\nHowever, the point can be made in another way. God is thought to be\ncausally active in the world, where those causal relations include\nGod\u2019s responding to petitionary prayer and being actively\ninvolved in world history. Similarly, God coexists with the world and\nsustains it in existence at every moment. God loves, and knows about\nthe lives of, God\u2019s creatures. All these are relations. God\nstands in causal and other relations to a temporal world.\nDoesn\u2019t this make God temporal (Mullins 2016, Ch. 5)?\n\nEach version of divine timelessness tries to address this concern in\nsome way. One somewhat radical response, given by Aquinas and others,\nis that while the world is related to God, God is not related to the\nworld.\n5.3 Arguments from Divine Personhood\n\nSuppose that whatever is a person does at least some of the following:\nremembering, anticipating, reflecting, deliberating, deciding,\nintending, and acting intentionally. If timelessness precludes one\nfrom doing any of these, then being timeless is incompatible with\nbeing a person. Since God is a person, God is not timeless.\n\nBut is it the case that being a person requires one to do at least\nsome of the above? Instead one might hold that at most, it requires\none to be capable of doing at least some of the above. And\nperhaps a timeless God is capable of doing some of the above, even if\nGod does not do them.\n\nAlternatively, one might question the grounds for thinking that these\nactivities tend to be precluded by timelessness. It is true that they\nall seem to involve change, namely a change in one\u2019s mental\nstates. But defenders of timelessness may think we should leave room\nin our conceptual scheme for a timeless, changeless version of each of\nthese activities (Craig 2009; Murray & Rea 2008: Ch. 2).\n6. Arguments for Divine Timelessness\n6.1 Arguments from Divine Perfection\n\nThere are a number of considerations speaking in favor of divine\ntimelessness that arise out of perfect being theology. Perfect being\ntheology is the approach to theology that involves figuring out what\nGod is like on the basis of God\u2019s being the most perfect (or\ngreatest possible) being. A general argument goes as follows. The most\nperfect being, God, has the most perfect mode of existence. But\ntemporal existence is a less perfect mode of existence than timeless\nexistence. Therefore, God has a timeless mode of existence.\n\nWhy think that temporal existence is less perfect than timeless\nexistence? Note that we\u2019re here mostly concerned with the second\nissue distinguished at the beginning of\n section 4,\n namely the nature of God\u2019s experience (rather than the first,\nnamely whether or not God is located in time/spacetime). The thought\nis that ordinary temporal experience involves gain and loss, and an\nawareness of the inescapable passage of time. Relatedly, for ordinary\ntemporal beings, neither the distant past nor the future are\nperceptually accessible. We remember parts of the past, but\nimperfectly, and we merely anticipate the future. We know much less\nabout the future than the past. We can\u2019t change or re-experience\nthe past, nor can we skip ahead to later moments, except one at a\ntime.\n\nBut then again, God is no ordinary temporal being. The defender of\ntemporality can reply that while God\u2019s life has temporal\nfeatures, in that God experiences succession, God\u2019s temporal\nexperience is otherwise very much unlike ours (Mullins 2014). For\nexample, God is omniscient, so God forgets no part of the past and\nalready knows all about the future. It\u2019s true that experiencing\nsuccession means experiencing things one at a time. But, the defender\nof temporality might add, this very feature is necessary for, e.g.,\nthe ability to enjoy music, which is good and therefore something the\nmost perfect being would have.\n\nThere are more indirect ways of arguing from perfection to\ntimelessness. For example, suppose that the most perfect mode of\nexistence involves immutability, and that immutability requires\ntimelessness. Or suppose that perfection requires divine simplicity,\nand that simplicity requires timelessness (for more, see the SEP\nentries on\n divine simplicity\n and\n immutability).\n6.2 Arguments from Divine Foreknowledge\n\nOne line of thought is that complete knowledge of future contingent\nevents is impossible for beings in time. Since God is omniscient, and\ntherefore knows all that will happen, God is timeless.\n\nAnother line of thought is that while God is omniscient, and therefore\nknows all that will happen, some of our actions are genuinely free.\nBut these two facts are in tension with one another, and the tension\ncan be resolved by thinking of God as timeless.\n\nHere is this line of thought in more detail. First consider an\nargument for theological fatalism, the view that divine foreknowledge\nand freedom are incompatible (Pike 1965; Murray & Rea 2008: Ch.\n2). God is omniscient. So God knows all that is true and believes\nnothing false. Now consider the proposition p that you will\nread this section 1,000 years hence. Suppose p was true 1,000\nyears ago. Then God believed p then. And you never had a choice\nabout whether God believed p 1,000 years ago. Nor have you ever\nhad a choice about anything that follows from God\u2019s believing\np 1,000 years ago, including that you read this section today.\nSo you never had a choice about whether you read this section today,\nwhich means you\u2019re not doing it freely.\n\nOne proposed solution is to deny that p was true 1,000 years\nago. (Aristotle responds in this way to a similar, non-theological\nargument for logical fatalism.) For more on this solution, see the SEP\nentries on\n foreknowledge and free will\n and\n fatalism.\n\nA defender of divine timelessness may attempt another solution\n(inspired by Boethius). God is not located in time, so God does not\nknow or believe things at times. So it is not the case that God\nbelieved p 1,000 years ago. Rather, all temporal events are\nbefore God\u2019s mind \u201cat once\u201d, or in an atemporal\npresent. However, some argue that a similar problem still arises\n(Zagzebski 1991: Ch. 2).\n6.3 Arguments from Relativity Theory\n\nGod is immaterial. Suppose it follows from this that God is not in\nspace. Then one might argue that relativity theory implies that God is\nnot in time either, because according to relativity theory, anything\nthat is in time is also in space (Leftow 1991: 272).\n\nWhile the basic thought is clear enough, one might worry about the\ndetails of this argument. In relativity theory, there are no such\nthings as times or spatial locations, at the fundamental level. So it\nwould be at least misleading to say that according to relativity\ntheory, anything that is located at times is located at spatial\nlocations. But a defender of the argument probably has in mind\nprecisely this implication of (special) relativity, that\nspatiotemporal regions are fundamental, because there is no unique\ndecomposition of spacetime into space at times. Presumably the lesson\nof relativity theory for the present debate can be suitably\nreformulated.\n Further Reading on God and Time: Pike 1970; Braine 1988; Yates\n1990; Gale 1991; Mawson 2008; Craig 1998, 2001, 2009; Murray & Rea\n2008; Leftow 2010; Tapp & Runggaldier 2011; Oppy 2014; Mullins\n2016; Melamed 2016; Deng 2019; Schm\u00fccker, Williams and Fischer\n2022; Moravec (forthcoming); and Ganssle (Other Internet\nResources). \n7. Other Debates about Eternity \n\nBoth timelessness or atemporality, and permanence or everlastingness,\nare widely applicable concepts. This section outlines a few non-religious\nphilosophical debates in which the concept of eternity, in the sense\nof atemporality, can play a role (McDaniel 2016).\n\nConsider questions about the nature of propositions, mathematical\nobjects, or other abstracta. Perhaps these are atemporal entities,\nexisting outside of time/spacetime, and not standing in any\nspatiotemporal relations to other entities. What sorts of\nconsiderations might bear on whether they are or not? Take\npropositions, the true or false things sentences express. Take a\nsentence that changes its truth-value over time (e.g.,\n\u201cIt\u2019s sunny\u201d). Does such a sentence express\ndifferent propositions at different times (that it\u2019s sunny at\n\\(t_1\\), that it\u2019s sunny at \\(t_2\\), etc.)? Or does it express\nthe same proposition over time (that it\u2019s sunny)? If it\u2019s\nthe former, then the propositions expressed don\u2019t themselves\nchange truth-value. If it\u2019s the latter, the proposition (that\nit\u2019s sunny) itself changes truth-value. In this latter case,\nthat might give one reason think that the proposition is located\nwithin time rather than outside of it. On the other hand, it might\nnot. After all, the truth-value also seems to vary with spatial\nlocation; yet we may be reluctant to infer from this that the\nproposition has spatial locations.\n\nAs another example, consider the view that time does not exist, for\nexample as argued for by speculative metaphysicians such as McTaggart\nor F. H. Bradley. On such views, everything is eternal (in the\nsense of atemporal).\n\nThe view that time is unreal was also argued for by Kurt G\u00f6del on\nthe basis of general relativistic considerations (G\u00f6del\n1949). G\u00f6del\u2019s starting point is his discovery of solutions\nto Einstein\u2019s Field Equations that permit the existence of\nclosed timelike curves. Such spacetimes, he argues, do not contain a\ntemporal dimension, since time only exists if there is genuine passage\nof time, and there cannot be genuine passage of time in such\nworlds. This in turn suggests that time does not pass, and thus does\nnot exist, in the actual world either (for more on the argument see\nSavitt 1994; Dorato 2002; Yourgrau 2005).\n\nMore recently, some physicists and philosophers of physics working on\napproaches to quantum gravity have entertained the view that spacetime\nmay not be fundamental (see the SEP entry on\n quantum gravity).\n Of course, whether the concept of atemporality applies in this\ncontext depends on how the claim that spacetime is not fundamental is\nbest understood.",
