    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\n\nAnaxagoras, son of Hegesibulus (or Eubulus), was a native of\nClazomenae, on the west coast of what is now Turkey. According to\nDiogenes Laertius (see the article on Doxography of Ancient\nPhilosophy) (Diels-Kranz [DK] 59 A1), Anaxagoras came from an\naristocratic and landed family, but abandoned his inheritance to study\nphilosophy. (We do not know how he acquired his philosophical\nlearning). He came to Athens (perhaps about the middle of the\n5th century, perhaps earlier), and was a friend and\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Pericles, the Athenian general and political\nleader. There is controversy about his time in Athens; Diogenes\nLaertius says that he came to Athens to study philosophy as a young\nman. Some scholars claim that his arrival was as early as the Persian\ninvasion of 480 (O\u2019Brien 1968, Woodbury 1981, Graham 2006), others\nargue for a later date of about 456 (Mansfeld 1979, see also Mansfeld\n2011 on Aristotle\u2019s evidence; there is a good discussion of the\nproblems about dating Anaxagoras\u2019 life in Sider 2005). It is clear\nfrom their dramas that his work was known to Sophocles, Euripides, and\nperhaps Aeschylus (Seneca suggests in his Natural Questions\n4a.2.17 that they shared Anaxagoras\u2019 view about the source of the\nNile); it was certainly familiar to the comic playwright Aristophanes\n(Curd 2007, Sider 2005; see Mansfeld 1979). He was a resident in the\ncity for at least twenty years; he was said to have been charged with\nimpiety (and perhaps with Medism, political sympathy with the\nPersians), and banished from the city (437/6?). The charges against\nAnaxagoras may have been as much political as religious, because of\nhis close association with Pericles. He retreated to Lampsacus (in the\neastern Hellespont) where he died; ancient reports say that he was\nmuch honored there before and after his death. Democritus, a younger\ncontemporary, dated his own life in relation to Anaxagoras\u2019, saying\nthat he was young in the old age of Anaxagoras (DK59A5); he reportedly\naccused Anaxagoras of plagiarism. Although Anaxagoras lived in Athens\nwhen Socrates was a youth and young adult, there are no reports that\nAnaxagoras and Socrates ever met. In Plato\u2019s Phaedo, Socrates\nsays that he heard someone reading from Anaxagoras\u2019 book (probably\nArchelaus, who was, according to Diogenes Laertius, pupil of\nAnaxagoras and teacher of Socrates).  Anaxagoras is included in the\nancient lists of those who wrote only one book: in\nthe Apology, Socrates reports that it could be bought for a\ndrachma.\n\n\nAs with all the Presocratics, Anaxagoras\u2019 work survives only in\nfragments quoted by later philosophers and commentators; we also have\ntestimonia about his views in many ancient sources. The standard\ncollection of Presocratic texts (both fragments and testimonia) is\nH. Diels and W. Kranz, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, in\nwhich Anaxagoras is given the identifying number 59. The Greek text\nand translations can also be found in Gemelli-Marciano, 2007\u20132010; Graham, 2010; and Laks and Most, 2016a and 2016b.  (For discussion\nof the sources for the Presocratics, and problems associated with\nthem, see the article on Presocratic Philosophy.) Any\ndiscussion of Anaxagoras\u2019 views must be a reconstruction that goes\nbeyond the few details that we have in the verbatim quotations, though\ninformed by the evidence of the fragments and testimonia. It should be\nkept in mind in reading the following account that scholars disagree and that other\ninterpretations are possible.\n\n\nAccording to Simplicius, a 6th century C.E. neo-Platonist\ncommentator on Aristotle, and our main source for the fragments,\nAnaxagoras began his book by describing an original state of complete\n(but not entirely uniform) mixture of all the ingredients of the\ncosmos; that mixture is then set in motion by the action of\nMind/Intellect (nous). The ingredients are eternal and always remain in a\nmixture of all with all, yet the rotary motion produces shifts in the\nproportions of the ingredients in a given region. The expanding\nrotation of the original mixture ultimately produces the continuing development\nof the world as we now perceive it. The foundations of his theory,\ndescriptions of this development, and a discussion of nous\nform the bulk of what remains to us of Anaxagoras\u2019 book. The\ntestimonia suggest that the book also included detailed accounts of\nastronomical, meteorological, and geological phenomena as well as more\ndetailed discussions of perception and knowledge, now missing from our\ncollection of fragments, and known only by later reports and criticisms.\n",
