    "main_text": "Steady-state Cosmology || Bondi\u2019s Philosophical Origins\n8.1 Bondi\u2019s Philosophical Origins\n\nBondi reveals his philosophical commitments in several ways. First, he\nargues against induction and extrapolation from small-scale\nexperiment, that is, against the inductive empiricism of Dingle et\nal. Secondly, he argues in favor of hypothesis and deduction,\nthat is, in favor of Milne et al. Finally, he specifically\nremarks the excellence of Milne\u2019s Methods, and the\ntheory\u2014kinematic relativity\u2014created therefrom, and remarks\nthe significance of these elements in the creation of his version of\nthe new steady-state cosmology.\n\nFrom the very beginning Bondi admits the validity of both positions in\nthe methodological debate:\n\nIn particular, there are two important approaches to the subject\n[cosmology] so different from each other that it is hardly surprising\nthat they lead to different answers\u2026The contrast between the\n\u2018extrapolating\u2019 and the \u2018deductive\u2019 attitudes\nto cosmology is very great indeed. (Bondi 1960), p. 3\u20135)\n\n\nThe extrapolating approach, which Bondi sometimes calls the\nempirical school, is represented by Dingle, McVittie, and\ntheir colleagues. Opposed to the extrapolative approach is the\ndeductive approach, which \u201cis reached from\ninvestigations in the borderland between physics and\nphilosophy.\u201d Milne is obviously the major proponent of this\nview. Although Bondi finds good points in both approaches, he also\nfinds problems in both approaches. In the end, cosmology is the worse\nfor excesses from either end of the spectrum:\n\nJust as some adherents of the \u2018empirical\u2019 school tend to\nregard cosmology as a testing ground for their extrapolations and as a\nlegitimate playground for the geometers, so some adherents of the\ndeductive approach appear to regard cosmology as a purely logical\nsubject. (Bondi 1960, p. 7)\n\n\nIn this latter case, the deductive extremists, in their mathematical\nzeal, seem to forget that cosmology, after all,\nshould have some relation to observation: \u201cTo\nthem all that is of interest in a theory is its logical character, not\nits relevance to the interpretation of observational data.\u201d\nObviously, this danger must be avoided: according to Bondi,\ndeductivism can be a scientific approach in\ncosmology only if its postulates (or axioms) are candidates for\ndisproof.\n",
