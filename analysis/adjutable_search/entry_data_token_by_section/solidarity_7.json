    "main_text": "Solidarity in Practice || Conclusion\n2.6 Conclusion\n\nIn this section, we have reviewed some of the salient histories in\nwhich use of the term \u201csolidarity\u201d has figured. The survey\nhas had two functions. First, it has served to provide an overview of\nthe political and social uses for which solidarity has been enlisted.\nDoing so enables us to frame the descriptive and normative challenges\nthat any theory of solidarity faces: Does solidarity have a single\nnature that is repeated across different paradigmatic instances? Or is\nit a malleable, vague term with no fixed content? What, if anything,\nmakes solidarity valuable? What should the grounds of solidarity be\nin, for example, different social movements, in the welfare state, or\nin political and social associations more broadly? Second, the survey\nprovides a testing ground for new theories of solidarity, which, we\nhave argued, should be responsive to the concept\u2019s history.\nTheories should be adopted and rejected according to whether they\nsuccessfully serve to describe, evaluate, and guide the various\npractices in which the term figures, and has figured. While a theory\nmight recommend conceptual change, of course, it needs to be clear why\nand how such a change is worth making. Either way, being aware of the\nconcept\u2019s history is crucial since solidarity names not just an\nideal but a concrete set of practices.\n",
