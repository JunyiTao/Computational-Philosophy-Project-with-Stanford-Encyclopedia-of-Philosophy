Should participants who donate blood in a medical trial be\npermitted to authorize its use in any future trial, without their\nspecific consent for each token (as U.S. federal regulations allow\nthem, since 2018, to do)? What about a patient or a candidate study\nparticipant who asks to be spared tedious descriptions of her\ndifferent options, and would rather entrust the medical team, or her\nvillage elder, with key decisions? What about someone who asks her\nphysician to lie to her, if he is willing, should her prognosis be\ndespairing? And what about a woman who would like to sell pregnancy\nservices with a fully enforceable contract to hand over the baby even\nif she develops strong maternal feelings toward him or her and seeks\nto revoke her consent?\n\nIn democratic politics, we delegate many decisions to representatives.\nBut we keep ourselves barred from signing away others, including the\ndecision to waive our voting rights altogether. The question as to\nwhich decisions our institutions should allow patients to delegate to\nthird parties is complex and under-explored. Bioethicists usually\nfrown upon letting patients grant so-called carte blanche, or\ngeneral consent, to whatever the physician considers appropriate for\nthem (Dworkin 1988, e.g., 125\u20136). Instead, patients are usually\nencouraged or compelled to make decisions on a more ongoing\nbasis\u2014to give so-called specific consent (Kleinig 2010,\n18)\u2014although there are logical limits to how specific consent\ncan be (Manson and O\u2019Neill 2007, 12).\n\nThe requirement of informed consent is often attacked on the ground\nthat many patients would rather have physicians make certain decisions\nfor them, and that such delegation often seems acceptable (Schneider\n1998). One answer to the attack argues that informed consent is a\npatient\u2019s right, not her duty (Beauchamp and Childress 2008,\n105, 107), and that, since informed consent serves autonomy, it ought\nto be autonomously waiveable (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 106).\nIndeed, autonomously signed advance directives that bind one\u2019s\nfuture self can be perfectly consensual and autonomous. What we may\ncall \u201cwaiveable waivers\u201d of informed consent rights\n(\u201cPlease spare me the full disclosure or decide in my name\nunless I ask to resume full disclosure or active control\u201d) seem\nrelatively easy to accept and fairly consistent with autonomy.\nHowever, we do impose some rights, which we consider inalienable, on\nunwilling rights holders. The right not to become a slave is\ninalienable, and the same may apply to some informed consent rights,\nsuch as the right not to become a participant of a clinical trial that\none cannot exit.\n\nAn alternative answer to the attack is therefore that some informed\nconsent rights are waiveable (perhaps including many disclosure\nrights), and others are non-waiveable (perhaps including the right to\nrevoke prior consent to bodily intrusion). Theory is needed in order\nto tell which informed consent rights are waiveable and which are not.\n(Is the alleged second-order right to waive informed consent\nrights alienable?) Theory should also explore whether non-waiveable\nconsent requirements are consistent with patient autonomy, say,\nbecause what such requirements impose is autonomous decision-making\n(potentially out of paternalistic concern with protecting the\npatient\u2019s autonomy).\n",
