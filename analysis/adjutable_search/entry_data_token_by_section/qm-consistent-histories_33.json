    "main_text": "Difficulties and Objections || Single framework rule\n11.2 Single framework rule\nThe single framework rule itself lies at the center of a large\nnumber of objections to the histories approach, which is hardly\nsurprising since in an important sense it marks the boundary between\nclassical and quantum physics. As it is absent from classical physics\nand from most quantum textbooks, the concept is unfamiliar, and one\nhas to work through various examples in order to gain an intuitive as\nwell as a formal understanding of how it deals with the various\nparadoxes and other conceptual difficulties of quantum theory. The\nfour principles R1 to R4 found in subsection 5.1\nshould help in understanding how frameworks should be thought of and\nhow they should be used. It is of particular importance that the\nsingle framework rule does not imply that there is only one\nway available to the physicist to think about or discuss a particular\nsituation. What it forbids is not the construction of many, perhaps\nmutually incompatible, frameworks, but combining them in the\nfashion characteristic of the incompatibility paradoxes discussed\nabove in subsection 10.3. Indeed, the single\nframework rule rather than being a restriction actually extends the\nLiberty of the theoretical physicist to describe the quantum world in\na consistent way without the danger of running into insoluble\nparadoxes. But Liberty is coupled to a denial of the unicity of the\nworld, subsection 11.4, which is perhaps the most\nimportant philosophical implication of quantum mechanics from the\nhistories perspective, as well as the principal stumbling block in the\nway of a wider acceptance of that approach as a satisfactory\ninterpretation of quantum theory.\n",
