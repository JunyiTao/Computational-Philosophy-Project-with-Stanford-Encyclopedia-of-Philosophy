    "main_text": "The Sufficiency Argument\n2. The Sufficiency Argument\n\nThe claim that knowledge-how is a kind of knowledge-that encounters an\nimmediate incredulous stare: how could propositional knowledge be\nsufficient for knowing how to do something? Ryle (1946: 5) himself\nposes this challenge as a starting point for his argument: \n\n\nObviously there is no truth or set of truths of which we could say\n\u201cIf only the stupid player had been informed of them, he would\nbe a clever player\u201d, or \u201cWhen once he had been apprised of\nthese truths he would play well\u201d.\n\n\nCertainly, one might know all the propositions that are relevant to\nhow to perform a task, and yet fail to know how to perform it:\nknowledge-that does not seem sufficient for knowledge-how (see also\nRyle 1940: 38\u20139). \n\nIn order to assess this objection, it is helpful to start with a toy\nintellectualist theory, on which knowledge-how is a matter of knowing,\nfor some way or method to perform a task w, that w is in\nfact a way to perform it. In\n section 4,\n we will see in more detail a linguistic argument for identifying\nknowledge-how with this sort of propositional knowledge (Stanley &\nWilliamson 2001; Snowdon 2004). How could, the insufficiency objection\ngoes, one know how to perform a task just in virtue of knowing a\nproposition about a way to perform it? Consider the following\ncounterexample to intellectualism:\n\n\nSwimming: Suppose I look at a swimmer\u2019s\nswimming, and my swimming instructor pointing to the swimmer says to\nme, \u201cThat is a way in which you could swim too\u201d. I believe\nmy instructor and we may suppose that what she said is in fact true. I\nmay thereby come to know a true answer to the question \u201cHow\ncould I swim?\u201d However, in the relevant sense, I may not have\ncome to know how to swim. If I took a swimming test, I might still\nfail it. If thrown in the swimming pool, I might still drown. I do not\nknow how to swim in the relevant sense and yet I do know a true\nproposition about how to swim.\n\n\nIn response to this sort of counterexample, intellectualists often\nappeal to \u201cpractical modes of presentation\u201d: knowing a\nproposition observationally or demonstratively is not the same as\nknowing it practically. Knowledge-how is, at least in part, a matter\nof representing propositions about tasks and ways of executing tasks\nin a distinctively practical fashion. For one to know how to swim, in\nthe relevant sense, one must know of a way to swim represented under a\ndistinctive practical mode of presentation, which is essentially\ndifferent from the observational or demonstrative mode of presentation\nin Swimming. This kind of practically represented\npropositional knowledge is what (some) intellectualists call\nknowledge-how and is what is absent in the example above.\n\nThe notion of practical modes of presentation has received several\ncriticisms (Schiffer 2002; Koethe 2002; No\u00eb 2005; Fantl 2011;\nGlick 2015), on the ground that it seems excessively obscure or even\nquestion begging. Koethe (2002: 327) worries that practical modes of\npresentation smuggle in an antecedent notion of knowledge-how (though\nsee Fantl 2008: 461 for a response). This widespread skepticism about\npractical modes of presentation has led some intellectualists to\nexplore ways of responding to the insufficiency objection that do not\nappeal to practical modes of presentation. For example, Stanley\n(2011b: 126) considers answering the sufficiency challenge in\nSwimming by appealing to the context-sensitivity of\nthe ability modal \u201ccould\u201d. According to Stanley, depending\non how the context for the modal is restricted, \u201cThat is how you\ncould swim\u201d could mean either that that is how you can swim\ngiven your current physical state or that that is how you\ncould swim after training. But coming to know that that is\nhow I could swim after training is clearly not enough for me to come\nto know how to swim now. Instead, the argument goes, what one needs to\nknow is the former proposition: that that is a way to swim given\nmy current physical state.\n\nYet, it is unclear that even this response works. Consider a variant\nof the previous scenario, where Mary is a skilled swimmer who is one\nday affected by memory loss and so forgets how she is able to swim\n(Glick 2015). Nothing has changed in Mary\u2019s physical state: she\nis still able to swim but she just has forgotten how she is able to\nswim. Suppose she is told, by looking at a recording of her swimming\nthe day before, that that is how she can in fact swim given\nher current physical state. She might come to know how she is in fact\nable to swim (just like that!). Yet, she would still fail to know how\nto swim in the relevant sense and still drown if thrown into the pool.\n\n\nSo, practical modes of representation are hard to escape if\nintellectualism is to be defended against the sufficiency objection.\nTo assuage concerns about the intelligibility of practical modes of\npresentation, Pavese (2015b) proposes we think of them along the lines\nof practical senses, which in turn can be modeled after computer\nprograms. Programs determine an output, just like Fregean senses\ndetermine a referent; and they are practical in that they break down a\ntask into the smallest parts that the system can execute (the\nprimitive operations of the system as well as into primitive ways of\ncombining those parts) so they ground the ability to perform a complex\ntask in terms of the ability to perform all of its parts. On this\nview, if one represents a task practically, one represents all of its\nparts, and the combination of those parts, through instructions that\none has the ability to execute. So representing practically a task\nentails that one has the ability to perform the corresponding task.\n(For a critical discussion of practical ways of thinking, see Mosdell\n2019. Habgood-Coote 2018c argues that the classical generality problem\nfor reliabilism (Feldman 1985; Conee & Feldman 1998) arises for\nintellectualism.)\n\nThe notion of distinctively practical concepts is motivated by work\noutside the debate on intellectualism about knowledge-how. Other\nscholars have discussed concepts that are practical in that they\ndissociate from semantic and observational concepts and play a central\nrole in explaining behavior. Peacocke (1986: 49\u201350) talks of\n\u201caction-based ways of thinking\u201d, Israel, Perry,and Tutiya\n(1993: 534) of \u201cexecutable ideas\u201d, and Pacherie (2000,\n2006) of \u201caction concepts\u201d. Mylopoulous and Pacherie\n(2017) suggest that executable action concepts might be needed to\novercome the interface problem\u2014the problem of how cognitive\nrepresentations (intentions) interact with motor representations\n(Butterfill & Sinigaglia 2014). Pavese (forthcoming-b) advances an\nempirical-functional case for practical concepts, arguing that they\nare needed to explain a distinctive sort of productive reasoning. Yet,\nother intellectualists argue we can dispense with practical modes of\npresentation altogether and instead appeal to ways of knowing\nthat are distinctively practical or executive (Waights Hickman 2019;\nCath 2020).\n\nLevy (2017) argues that a form of intellectualism that only invokes\npractical ways of thinking and practical concepts might not be able to\nexplain skillful motor behavior, for motor representations of the sort\nrequired for skilled action and posited by cognitive psychologists are\nnon-conceptual. Along similar lines, Fridland (2014, 2017) argues\nmotor control and motor representation cannot be countenanced by\nStanley & Williamson\u2019s (2001) and Stanley\u2019s (2011b)\nforms of intellectualism. So, more promising forms of intellectualism\nmight have to invoke, in addition to practical ways of thinking,\nnon-conceptual practical representations (Pavese 2019;\nKrakauer 2020). Just like perceptual concepts are distinguished from\nnon-conceptual perceptual representations, we might distinguish\nbetween practical conceptual representations and practical\nnon-conceptual representations. Motor representations would fall under\nthe latter heading. Nonconceptual motor representations also represent\npractically, as they break down a task in terms of the most basic\noperations that a system can perform.\n",
