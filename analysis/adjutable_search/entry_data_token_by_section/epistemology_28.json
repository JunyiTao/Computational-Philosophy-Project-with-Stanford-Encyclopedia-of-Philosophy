    "main_text": "The Limits of Cognitive Success || Responses to the Defeasibility Argument\n6.4 Responses to the Defeasibility Argument\n\nThe most influential reply to\n BKDA\n is to say that, when I acquire evidence that I don\u2019t have\nhands, such evidence makes me cease to know that I have hands. On this\nview, when I acquire such evidence, the argument above is sound. But\nprior to my acquiring such evidence, (4) is false, and so the argument\nabove is not sound. Thus, the truth of (4), and consequently the\nsoundness of this argument, depends on whether or not I have evidence\nthat I don\u2019t have hands. If I do have such evidence, then the\nargument is sound, but of course it has no general skeptical\nimplications: all it shows that I can\u2019t know some fact whenever\nI have evidence that the fact doesn\u2019t obtain (versions of this\nview are defended by Harman 1973 and Ginet 1980).\n\nPlausible as this reply has seemed to most philosophers, it has been\neffectively challenged by Lasonen-Aarnio (2014b). Her argument is\nthis: presumably, it\u2019s possible to have more than\nenough evidence to know some fact. But if it\u2019s possible to\nhave more than enough evidence to know some fact, it follows that one\nmight still know that fact even if one acquires some slight evidence\nagainst it. And yet, it would be wrong to leave one\u2019s confidence\nentirely unaffected by the slight evidence that one acquires against\nthat fact: though the evidence might be too slight to destroy\none\u2019s knowledge, it cannot be too slight to diminish one\u2019s\nconfidence even slightly. So long as one could continue to know a fact\nwhile rationally diminishing one\u2019s confidence in it in response\nto new evidence, the most popular reply to the defeasibility argument\nfails.\n\nOther replies to the defeasibility argument include the denial of\npremise\n (2),[65]\n the denial of (4) (McDowell 1982, Kern 2006 [2017]), and the claim\nthat the context-sensitivity of \u201cknows\u201d means that (4) is\ntrue only relative to contexts in which the possibility of future\ndefeaters is relevant (see Neta 2002). But neither of these replies\nhas yet received widespread assent.\n",
