    "main_text": "Semantic Games with Imperfect Information\n4. Semantic Games with Imperfect Information\n\nIn this and the next section we look at some adaptations of the\nsemantic games of the previous section to other logics. In our first\nexample, the logic (the independence-friendly logic of Hintikka and\nSandu 1997, or more briefly IF logic) was created in order to fit the\ngame. See the entry on\n independence friendly logic\n and Mann, Sandu and Sevenster 2011 for fuller accounts of this\nlogic.\n\nThe games here are the same as in the previous section, except that we\ndrop the assumption that each player knows the previous history of the\nplay. For example we can require a player to make a choice without\nknowing what choices the other player has made at certain earlier\nmoves. The classical way to handle this within game theory is to make\nrestrictions on the strategies of the players. For example we can\nrequire that the strategy function telling \\(\\exists\\) what to do at a\nparticular step is a function whose domain is the family of possible\nchoices of \\(\\forall\\) at just his first and second moves; this is a\nway of expressing that \\(\\exists\\) doesn\u2019t know how \\(\\forall\\)\nchose at his third and later moves. Games with restrictions of this\nkind on the strategy functions are said to be of imperfect\ninformation, as opposed to the games of perfect\ninformation in the previous section.\n\nTo make a logic that fits these games, we use the same first-order\nlanguage as in the previous section, except that a notation is added\nto some quantifiers (and possibly also some connectives), to show that\nthe Skolem functions for these quantifiers (or connectives) are\nindependent of certain variables. For example the sentence \n\n\\[\n(\\forall x)(\\exists y/ \\forall x)R(x, y)\n\\]\n\n\nis read as: \u201cFor every \\(x\\) there is \\(y\\), not depending on\n\\(x\\), such that \\(R(x, y)\\)\u201d.\n\nThere are three important comments to make on the distinction between\nperfect and imperfect information. The first is that the Gale-Stewart\ntheorem holds only for games of perfect information. Suppose for\nexample that \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\) play the following game.\nFirst, \\(\\forall\\) chooses one of the numbers 0 and 1. Then\n\\(\\exists\\) chooses one of these two numbers. Player \\(\\exists\\) wins\nif the two numbers chosen are the same, and otherwise player\n\\(\\forall\\) wins. We require that \\(\\exists\\), when she makes her\nchoice, doesn\u2019t know what \\(\\forall\\) chose; so a Skolem\nfunction for her will be a constant. (This game corresponds to the IF\nsentence above with \\(R\\) read as equality, in a structure with a\ndomain consisting of 0 and 1.) It\u2019s clear that player\n\\(\\exists\\) doesn\u2019t have a constant winning strategy, and also\nthat player \\(\\forall\\) doesn\u2019t have a winning strategy at all.\nSo this game is undetermined, although its length is only 2.\n\nOne corollary is that Hintikka\u2019s justification for reading\nnegation as dualising (\u2018players swap places\u2019), in his\ngames for first-order logic, doesn\u2019t carry over to IF logic.\nHintikka\u2019s response has been that dualising was the correct\nintuitive meaning of negation even in the first-order case, so no\njustification is needed. \n\nThe second comment is that already in games of perfect information, it\ncan happen that winning strategies don\u2019t use all the available\ninformation. For example in a game of perfect information, if player\n\\(\\exists\\) has a winning strategy, then she also has a winning\nstrategy where the strategy functions depend only on the previous\nchoices of \\(\\forall\\). This is because she can reconstruct her own\nprevious moves using her earlier strategy functions.\n\nWhen Hintikka used Skolem functions as strategies in his games for\nfirst-order logic, he made the strategies for a player depend only on\nthe previous moves of the other player. (A Skolem function for\n\\(\\exists\\) depends only on universally quantified variables.) Because\nthe games were games of perfect information, there was no loss in\nthis, by the second comment above. But when he moved to IF logic, the\nrequirement that strategies depend only on moves of the other player\nreally did make a difference. Hodges 1997 showed this by revising the\nnotation, so that for example \\((\\exists y/x)\\) means: \u201cThere is\n\\(y\\) independent of \\(x\\), regardless of which player chose\n\\(x\\)\u201d.\n\nConsider now the sentence  \n\n\\[\n(\\forall x)(\\exists z)(\\exists y/x)(x=y), \n\\]\n\n\nplayed again on a structure with two elements 0 and 1. Player\n\\(\\exists\\) can win as follows. For \\(z\\) she chooses the same as\nplayer \\(\\forall\\) chose for \\(x\\); then for \\(y\\) she chooses the\nsame as she chose for \\(z\\). This winning strategy works only because\nin this game \\(\\exists\\) can refer back to her own previous choices.\nShe would have no winning strategy if the third quantifier was\n\\((\\exists y/xz)\\), again because any Skolem function for this\nquantifier would have to be constant. The way that \\(\\exists\\) passes\ninformation to herself by referring to her previous choice is an\nexample of the phenomenon of signalling. John von Neumann and\nOskar Morgenstern illustrated it with the example of Bridge, where a\nsingle player consists of two partners who have to share information\nby using their public moves to signal to each other.\n\nThe third comment is that there is a dislocation between the intuitive\nidea of imperfect information and the game-theoretic definition of it\nin terms of strategies. Intuitively, imperfect information is a fact\nabout the circumstances in which the game is played, not about the\nstrategies. This is a very tricky matter, and it continues to lead to\nmisunderstandings about IF and similar logics. Take for example the\nsentence  \n\n\\[\n(\\exists x)(\\exists y/ x)(x=y),\n\\]\n\n\nagain played on a structure with elements 0 and 1. Intuitively one\nmight think that if \\(\\exists\\) isn\u2019t allowed to remember at the\nsecond quantifier what she chose at the first, then she can hardly\nhave a winning strategy. But in fact she has a very easy one:\n\u2018Always choose 0\u2019!\n\nCompared with first-order logic, IF logic is missing a component that\nthe game semantics won\u2019t supply. The game semantics tells us\nwhen a sentence is true in a structure. But if we take a formula with\n\\(n\\) free variables, what does the formula express about the ordered\n\\(n\\)-tuples of elements of the structure? In first-order logic it\nwould define a set of them, i.e. an \\(n\\)-ary relation on the\nstructure; the Tarski truth definition explains how. Is there a\nsimilar definition for arbitrary formulas of IF logic? It turns out\nthat there is one for the slightly different logic introduced by\nHodges 1997, and it leads to a Tarski-style truth definition for the\nlanguage of that logic. With a little adjustment this truth definition\ncan be made to fit IF logic too. But for both of these new logics\nthere is a catch: instead of saying when an assignment of elements to\nfree variables makes a formula true, we say when a set of\nassignments of elements to free variables makes the formula true.\nV\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007 made this idea the basis for a range of\nnew logics for studying the notion of dependence (see entry on\n dependence logic).\n In these logics the semantics is defined without games, although the\noriginal inspiration comes from the work of Hintikka and Sandu. \n\nIn V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen\u2019s logics it is easy to see why one\nneeds sets of assignments. He has an atomic formula expressing\n\u2018\\(x\\) is dependent on \\(y\\)\u2019. How can we interpret this\nin a structure, for example the structure of natural numbers? It makes\nno sense at all to ask for example whether 8 is dependent on 37. But\nif we have a set X of ordered pairs of natural numbers, it does make\nsense to ask whether in X the first member of each pair is dependent\non the second; the answer Yes would mean that there is a function\n\\(f\\) such that each pair \\((a,b)\\) in X has the form \\((f(b),b)\\).\n\n",
