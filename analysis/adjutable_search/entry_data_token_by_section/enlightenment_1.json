    "main_text": "The True: Science, Epistemology and Metaphysics in the Enlightenment || Rationalism and the Enlightenment\n1.1 Rationalism and the Enlightenment\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 rationalist system of philosophy is one\nof the pillars on which Enlightenment thought rests. Descartes\n(1596\u20131650) undertakes to establish the sciences upon a secure\nmetaphysical foundation. The famous method of doubt Descartes employs\nfor this purpose exemplifies (in part through exaggerating) an\nattitude characteristic of the Enlightenment. According to Descartes,\nthe investigator in foundational philosophical research ought to doubt\nall propositions that can be doubted. The investigator determines\nwhether a proposition is dubitable by attempting to construct a\npossible scenario under which it is false. In the domain of\nfundamental scientific (philosophical) research, no other authority\nbut one\u2019s own conviction is to be trusted, and not one\u2019s\nown conviction either, until it is subjected to rigorous skeptical\nquestioning. With his method, Descartes casts doubt upon the senses as\nauthoritative source of knowledge. He finds that God and the\nimmaterial soul are both better known, on the basis of innate ideas,\nthan objects of the senses. Through his famous doctrine of the dualism\nof mind and body, that mind and body are two distinct substances, each\nwith its own essence, the material world (allegedly) known through the\nsenses becomes denominated as an \u201cexternal\u201d world, insofar\nas it is external to the ideas with which one immediately communes in\none\u2019s consciousness. Descartes\u2019 investigation thus\nestablishes one of the central epistemological problems, not only of\nthe Enlightenment, but also of modernity: the problem of objectivity\nin our empirical knowledge. If our evidence for the truth of\npropositions about extra-mental material reality is always restricted\nto mental content, content before the mind, how can we ever be certain\nthat the extra-mental reality is not other than we represent it as\nbeing? Descartes\u2019 solution depends on our having secured prior\nand certain knowledge of God. In fact, Descartes argues that\nall human knowledge (not only knowledge of the material world\nthrough the senses) depends on metaphysical knowledge of God.\n\nDespite Descartes\u2019 grounding of all scientific knowledge in\nmetaphysical knowledge of God, his system contributes significantly to\nthe advance of natural science in the period. He attacks the\nlong-standing assumptions of the scholastic-aristotelians whose\nintellectual dominance stood in the way of the development of the new\nscience; he developed a conception of matter that enabled mechanical\nexplanation of physical phenomena; and he developed some of the\nfundamental mathematical resources \u2013 in particular, a way to\nemploy algebraic equations to solve geometrical problems \u2013 that\nenabled the physical domain to be explained with precise, simple\nmathematical formulae. Furthermore, his grounding of physics, and all\nknowledge, in a relatively simple and elegant rationalist metaphysics\nprovides a model of a rigorous and complete secular system of\nknowledge. Though major Enlightenment thinkers (for example Voltaire\nin his Letters on the English Nation, 1734) embrace\nNewton\u2019s physical system in preference to Descartes\u2019,\nNewton\u2019s system itself depends on Descartes\u2019 earlier work,\na dependence to which Newton himself attests.\n\nCartesian philosophy also ignites various controversies in the latter\ndecades of the seventeenth century that provide the context of\nintellectual tumult out of which the Enlightenment springs. Among\nthese controversies are the following: Are mind and body really two\ndistinct sorts of substances, and if so, what is the nature of each,\nand how are they related to each other, both in the human being (which\npresumably \u201chas\u201d both a mind and a body) and in a unified\nworld system? If matter is inert (as Descartes claims), what can be\nthe source of motion and the nature of causality in the physical\nworld? And of course the various epistemological problems: the problem\nof objectivity, the role of God in securing our knowledge, the\ndoctrine of innate ideas, and others.\n\nBaruch Spinoza\u2019s systematic rationalist metaphysics, which he\ndevelops in his Ethics (1677) in part in response to problems\nin the Cartesian system, is also an important basis for Enlightenment\nthought. Spinoza develops, in contrast to Cartesian dualism, an\nontological monism according to which there is only one substance, God\nor nature, with two attributes, corresponding to mind and body.\nSpinoza\u2019s denial, on the basis of strict philosophical\nreasoning, of the existence of a transcendent supreme being, his\nidentification of God with nature, gives strong impetus to the strands\nof atheism and naturalism that thread through Enlightenment\nphilosophy. Spinoza\u2019s rationalist principles also lead him to\nassert a strict determinism and to deny any role to final causes or\nteleology in explanation. (See Israel 2001.)\n\nThe rationalist metaphysics of Leibniz (1646\u20131716) is also\nfoundational for the Enlightenment, particularly the German\nEnlightenment (die Aufkl\u00e4rung), one prominent expression\nof which is the Leibnizian rationalist system of Christian Wolff\n(1679\u20131754). Leibniz articulates, and places at the head of\nmetaphysics, the great rationalist principle, the principle of\nsufficient reason, which states that everything that exists has a\nsufficient reason for its existence. This principle exemplifies the\ncharacteristic conviction of the Enlightenment that the universe is\nthoroughly rationally intelligible. The question arises of how this\nprinciple itself can be known or grounded. Wolff attempts to derive it\nfrom the logical principle of non-contradiction (in his First\nPhilosophy or Ontology, 1730). Criticism of this alleged\nderivation gives rise to the general question of how formal principles\nof logic can possibly serve to ground substantive knowledge of\nreality. Whereas Leibniz exerts his influence through scattered\nwritings on various topics, some of which elaborate plans for a\nsystematic metaphysics which are never executed by Leibniz himself,\nWolff exerts his influence on the German Enlightenment through his\ndevelopment of a rationalist system of knowledge in which he attempts\nto demonstrate all the propositions of science from first principles,\nknown a priori.\n\nWolff\u2019s rationalist metaphysics is characteristic of the\nEnlightenment by virtue of the pretensions of human reason\nwithin it, not by reason\u2019s success in establishing its claims.\nMuch the same could be said of the great rationalist philosophers of\nthe seventeenth century. Through their articulation of the\nideal of scientia, of a complete science of reality, composed\nof propositions derived demonstratively from a priori first\nprinciples, these philosophers exert great influence on the\nEnlightenment. But they fail, rather spectacularly, to realize this\nideal. To the contrary, what they bequeath to the eighteenth century\nis metaphysics, in the words of Kant, as \u201ca battlefield of\nendless controversies.\u201d However, the controversies themselves\n\u2013 regarding the nature of God, mind, matter, substance, cause,\net cetera, and the relations of each of these to the others \u2013\nprovide tremendous fuel to Enlightenment thought.\n",
