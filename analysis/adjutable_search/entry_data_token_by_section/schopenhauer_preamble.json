    "main_text": "\n\nArthur Schopenhauer was among the first 19th century\nphilosophers to contend that at its core, the universe is not a\nrational place. Inspired by Plato and Kant, both of whom regarded the\nworld as being more amenable to reason, Schopenhauer developed their\nphilosophies into an instinct-recognizing and ultimately ascetic\noutlook, emphasizing that in the face of a world filled with endless\nstrife, we ought to minimize our natural desires for the sake of\nachieving a more tranquil frame of mind and a disposition towards\nuniversal beneficence. Often considered to be a thoroughgoing\npessimist, Schopenhauer in fact advocated ways \u2013 via artistic,\nmoral and ascetic forms of awareness \u2013 to overcome a\nfrustration-filled and fundamentally painful human condition. Since\nhis death in 1860, his philosophy has had a special attraction for\nthose who wonder about life\u2019s meaning, along with those engaged\nin music, literature, and the visual arts.\n",
