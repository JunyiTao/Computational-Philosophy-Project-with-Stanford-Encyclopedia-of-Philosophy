    "main_text": "What is Mathematical Platonism? || Object realism\n1.3 Object realism\n\nLet object realism be the view that there exist abstract\nmathematical objects. Object realism is thus just the conjunction of\nExistence and\n Abstractness.[4]\n Object realism stands opposed to nominalism, which in\ncontemporary philosophy is typically defined as the view that there\nare no abstract objects. (In more traditional philosophical usage the\nword \u2018nominalism\u2019 refers instead to the view that there\nare no universals. See Burgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 13\u201325 and\nthe entry on\n abstract objects.)\n \n\nBecause object realism leaves out Independence, this\nview is logically weaker than mathematical platonism. The\nphilosophical consequences of object realism are thus not as strong as\nthose of platonism. Many physicalists would accept non-physical\nobjects provided that these are dependent on or reducible to physical\nobjects. They may for instance accept objects such as corporations,\nlaws, and poems, provided that these are suitably dependent or\nreducible to physical objects. Moreover, there appears to be no\nmystery about epistemic access to non-physical objects that we have\nsomehow made or \u2018constituted\u2019. If corporations, laws, and\npoems are made or \u2018constituted\u2019 by us, presumably we gain\nknowledge of them in the process of making or\n\u2018constituting\u2019 them.\n\nSome views in the philosophy of mathematics are object realist without\nbeing platonist. One example are traditional intuitionist views, which\naffirm the existence of mathematical objects but maintain that these\nobjects depend on or are constituted by mathematicians and their\n activities.[5]\n Some further examples of views that are object realist without being\nplatonist will be discussed in Section\n 4.\n",
