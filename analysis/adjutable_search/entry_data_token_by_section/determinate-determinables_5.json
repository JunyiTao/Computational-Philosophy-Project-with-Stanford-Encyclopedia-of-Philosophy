    "main_text": "Features and ontological categories || Features\n2.1 Features\n\nWe are now in position to list the features commonly taken to\ncharacterize determinables, determinates, and their\n relation;[4]\n the presentation is in terms of properties, and may require\nadjustment to apply to entities of other categories\n (see \u00a72.2).\n This is not a minimal or axiomatic set: some features follow from\nothers; moreover, there are cases to be made that some of these\nfeatures do not hold in full generality. In addition, how to\nmetaphysically understand these features varies, in ways we will\ndiscuss down the line.\n\n\n\nIncreased specificity: If \\(P\\) is a determinate of\n(\u2018determines\u2019) \\(Q\\), then to be \\(P\\) is to be \\(Q\\), in\na specific way.\n\nDetermination relates properties that are more or less specific,\nrelative to each other. For example, red is a determinate of\ncolor; scarlet is a determinate of red. \n\n\nIrreflexivity, Asymmetry, Transitivity: For\nno \\(P\\) does \\(P\\) determine \\(P\\); if \\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\), then\n\\(Q\\) does not determine \\(P\\); if \\(R\\) determines \\(P\\), and \\(P\\)\ndetermines \\(Q\\), then \\(R\\) determines \\(Q\\).\n\nThese features, characteristic of strict partial orderings, follow\njust from Increased specificity. For example,\nscarlet does not determine itself, since no property can be\nmore specific than itself. If scarlet determines\nred, then red does not determine scarlet,\nsince red cannot be both less and more specific than\nscarlet. And if to be scarlet is to be red, in a\nspecific way, and to be red is to be colored, in a specific\nway, then to be scarlet is to be a yet more specific way of\nbeing colored, such that scarlet determines\ncolor. \n\n\nRelative, leveled determination: Except for minimally\nspecific determinables and maximally specific determinates, a\nproperty\u2019s characterization as determinable or determinate is\nrelative. Relatedly, determinables can be determined at different\n\u2018levels\u2019 of specificity.\n\nFor example, red is a determinate of color, but a\ndeterminable of scarlet; red, blue, and\nyellow determine color at one level of\nspecification; scarlet, navy, and buttercup\ndetermine color at another (more finely grained) level of\nspecification. \n\n\nDetermination \u2018in respect of\u2019 determinables: If\n\\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\), \\(P\\) is more specific than \\(Q\\) in respect\nof \\(Q\\).\n\nThe increase in specificity associated with determinates is, more\nspecifically, \u2018in respect of\u2019 the\n determinable.[5]\n For example, if red determines color, red\nis more specific than color in respect of color.\nDetermination in respect of a determinable is sometimes further\nexplicated as involving specification along one or more\n\u2018determination dimensions\u2019 of the determinable\u2014for\nexample, the determination dimensions of color are commonly\nsupposed to be hue, saturation, and\nbrightness. \n\n\nDeterminate similarity/comparability: If \\(P\\) and \\(R\\) are\ndifferent same-level determinates of a determinable \\(Q\\), then \\(P\\)\nand \\(R\\) are similar, and moreover comparable, in respect of\n\\(Q\\).\n\nThat determination is \u2018in respect of\u2019 determinables gives\nrise to similarity and systematic comparability relations among\ndeterminates. For example, determinates of\ncolor\u2014red, blue, orange,\netc.\u2014are all similar in being colors, and any two colors are\ncomparable in this respect: red is more similar to\norange than to blue in respect of color,\nand so on. \n\n\nNon-conjunctive specification: if \\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\),\nthen \\(P\\) is not identical with any conjunctive property conjoining\n\\(Q\\) with any property or properties independent of \\(Q\\).\n\nThe increase in specificity associated with determinates does not\ninvolve conjoining or otherwise combining the determinable with\nanother property independent of the determinable. For example,\nred is not appropriately understood as the conjunction of\ncolor and another property independent of color.\n\n\n\nNon-disjunctive specification: if \\(P\\) determines \\(Q\\),\nthen \\(Q\\) is not identical with any disjunctive property disjoining\n\\(P\\) with any property or properties independent of \\(P\\).\n\nThe increase in specificity associated with determinates does not\ninvolve disjunctive elimination. For example, color is not a\ndisjunction of red and some other property or properties\nindependent of red. \n\n\nDeterminable inheritance: For every determinable \\(Q\\) of a\ndeterminate \\(P\\): if \\(x\\) has \\(P\\) at a time \\(t\\) then \\(x\\) must\nhave \\(Q\\) at \\(t\\).\n\nObjects must have every determinable of any determinates they have.\nFor example, if something is scarlet, then it must also be both red\nand colored. \n\n\nRequisite determination: If \\(x\\) has a determinable \\(Q\\) at\na time \\(t\\), then for every level \\(L\\) of determination of \\(Q\\):\n\\(x\\) must have some \\(L\\)-level determinate \\(P\\) of \\(Q\\) at\n\\(t\\).\n\nObjects must have a determinate of every determinable they have. For\nexample, if something is colored, then it must be some specific color\n(e.g., red), and if something is red, then it must be some specific\nshade of red (e.g., scarlet). \n\n\nMultiple determinates: For every determinate \\(P\\) of a\ndeterminable \\(Q\\), there is a determinate \\(R\\) of \\(Q\\) that is\ndistinct from, but at the same level of specificity as, \\(P\\).\n\nWith determinate specificity comes multiplicity or diversity. For\nexample, color has multiple determinates (red,\nblue, yellow, and so on); red has multiple\ndeterminates (scarlet, crimson, burgundy,\nand so on). \n\n\nDeterminate incompatibility: If \\(x\\) has determinate \\(P\\)\nof determinable \\(Q\\) at time \\(t\\), then \\(x\\) cannot have, at \\(t\\),\nany other determinate \\(R\\) of \\(Q\\) at the same level of specificity\nas \\(P\\).\n\nFor example, an object cannot be both red and blue\nall over, at a\n time.[6]\n Determinate incompatibility is moreover \u2018opponent\u2019 in\nthat same-level determinates are exclusive\n alternatives.[7]\n\n\n\nUnique determination: If \\(x\\) has a determinable \\(Q\\) at a\ntime, then \\(x\\) has a unique\u2014one and only one\u2014determinate\n\\(P\\) at any given level of specification at that time.\n\nUnique determination is entailed by Requisite\ndetermination and Determinate incompatibility. \n\n\nAsymmetric modal dependence: if \\(P\\) is a determinate of\n\\(Q\\), then if \\(x\\) has \\(P\\) then \\(x\\) must have \\(Q\\), but for\nsome \\(y\\), \\(y\\) might have \\(Q\\) without having \\(P\\).\n\nFor example, anything that is scarlet must be red, but something might\nbe red without being scarlet (it might rather be, e.g., burgundy).\nAsymmetric modal dependence is entailed by Determinable\ninheritance, Requisite determination, and Multiple\ndeterminates. \n\n\nCausal compatibility: Determinables and determinates do not\ncausally compete.\n\nFor example, if a given patch is both red and\nscarlet, there is no in-principle difficulty with both\nred and scarlet being causally efficacious\nvis-\u00e1-vis the pecking of a pigeon trained to peck at\nany red patch. \n\n\nMotivated as they are by a limited range of paradigm cases, not all of\nthese features may be characteristic of determination in the strong\nsense of being required for the holding of that relation, as opposed\nto being typically or generally true of some or most instances of the\nrelation (or its relata).\n\nFor example, counterexamples have been offered to Determinate\nincompatibility (hence Unique determination). Johansson\n(2004) notes that if property is a determinable, then\nDeterminate incompatibility will fail, noting that on this\nscore \u201cJohnson [\u2026] generalized too quickly\u201d (2004:\n117); what is rather true is that \u201cfor some ontological\ndeterminables [\u2026] two determinates cannot possibly exist in the\nsame space-time region\u201d (2004: 118). Determinable odors, tastes,\nand sounds also appear to have (some) compatible determinates; as\nArmstrong (1978b) observes, \u201ca sauce may be both sour and sweet.\nA bell may have a tone which is composed of both a fundamental and a\nnumber of higher overtones\u201d (113; see also Fales 1990, Sanford\n2014, and Massin 2013).\n\nIt may also be questioned whether all determinates of determinables\ncan be systematically compared, as per Determinate\nsimilarity/comparability. It is unclear, for example, whether\nbeing pentagonal is more or less similar in respect of\nshape to being square or being sextagonal.\nIt is also unclear whether all determinates of smell admit of\nsystematic comparability (is the smell of pine more similar to the\nsmell of rose or of violet?), though recent empirical work identifying\nthe dimensions of \u201csmell space\u201d (see, e.g., Mamlouk &\nMartinetz 2004) may reveal an underlying structure of the sort\n(appealing to hue, saturation, and brightness) that serves as an\nunderlying basis for ordering determinate colors (which work might\nalso bear upon Armstrong\u2019s observations, above). The question of\nwhether all determinables may be systematically ordered with respect\nto their determinables, either explicitly or implicitly, matters to\nwhether determinate/determinable relations can be modeled in spatial\nterms along lines proposed by Funkhouser (2006)\n (see \u00a73.6.1).\n\nUnique determination and Requisite determination may\nalso admit of exceptions. One might maintain (see Wilson 2013) that\neven for paradigmatic determinables such as color, Unique\ndetermination is not generally correct, since the case of an\niridescent feather admits of a reasonable interpretation according to\nwhich the feather is (a) colored, (b) red from one perspective, and\n(c) blue from another perspective, such that no one determinate shade\nis non-arbitrarily identified as \u201cthe\u201d unique determinate\ndetermining the determinable color had by the feather; in\nsuch a case, the determinates are had, at best, in relativized\n fashion.[8]\n Fales observes that Requisite determination\n\n\nappears to admit of exceptions in the case of certain objects of\nmental acts: for example, as regards the number of spots on an\nimagined or a hallucinated speckled hen. (1990: 167)\n\n\nQuantum mechanics and the associated natural treatment of observables\nas determinables also offers apparent counterexamples to\nUnique and Requisite determination, associated with\nincompatible observables (so that if position is determinate,\nmomentum is not; see, e.g., Bokulich 2014: 463), and more\ngenerally cases of value indeterminacy\n (see \u00a75.3).\n Relatedly, certain understandings of vagueness or indeterminacy\ninvolve the rejection of Unique and Requisite\ndetermination. Rosen and Smith (2004) suggest that vagueness may\ninvolve an object\u2019s having a determinable without determinately\nhaving any corresponding determinate, and Wilson (2013) offers a\ndeterminable-based account of metaphysical indeterminacy as\ncharacteristically involving an entity (object, system) having a\ndeterminable but no unique determinate of the determinable, due either\nto there being too many candidate determinates (\u2018glutty\u2019\nindeterminacy) or too few (\u2018gappy\u2019 indeterminacy); the\nlatter determinable-based account has been applied to value\nindeterminacy in quantum mechanics\n (see \u00a75.3).\n The connection between the determinable position and\ntheories of location may also push against Unique and\nRequisite determination, insofar as the latter principles\ncorrespond to certain principles of location which are frequently\nasserted to be subject to counterexamples involving, e.g., gunky\nworlds, where an object may have a location but no exact location (see\nCalosi 2019).\n\nFinally, as we will see in\n \u00a73.4,\n a standard reductive approach to determinables takes these to be\ndisjunctive properties having associated determinates as disjuncts\n(see, e.g., Clapp 2001, Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002, Dosanjh 2021);\ndisjunctive reductionists uniformly reject Non-disjunctive\nspecification as ever true of determination or its relata. Here\nit is also worth noting that a common motivation for anti-realist or\nreductionist approaches involves the supposition that, contra\nCausal compatibility, determinables and determinates do\ncausally compete.\n",
