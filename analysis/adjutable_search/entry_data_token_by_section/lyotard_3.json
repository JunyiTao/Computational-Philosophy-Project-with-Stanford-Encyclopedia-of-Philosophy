    "main_text": "Major Works || Justice in light of the Postmodern Condition\n3.2 Justice in light of the Postmodern Condition\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, Lyotard moved towards considerations of\njustice that could discern among different regimes of intensities,\nbut only once we acknowledge the changes in the era in which we live.\nThe Postmodern Condition begins by defining the postmodern as\n\u201cincredulity towards metanarratives\u201d, which is fitting\ngiven that it is a report on knowledge in the contemporary age.\nLyotard means that modernist considerations of education as slowly\ndeveloping and emancipating human beings in terms of a common project\nwhere all forms of knowledge ultimately cohere has fallen away and\nthat we are left merely with \u201clittle\u201d or regional\nnarratives at odds with one another. He writes:\n\n\nI will use the term modern to designate any science that legitimates\nitself with reference to a metadiscourse \u2026 making an explicit\nappeal to some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of Spirit, the\nhermeneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working\nsubject, or the creation of wealth \u2026 I define postmodern as\nincredulity toward metanarratives. (Postmodern Condition,\nxxiii\u2013xxiv)\n\n\nThis is the overarching theme of the book, which also takes up the\ncrisis of legitimation in the sciences, which often must use\nextra-scientific narratives to attempt to place themselves above other\nkinds of narration (the arts, novels, philosophy, and so forth) as the\nfinal arbiter of truth, and hence is one of the last metanarratives of\nmodernity. The problem, Lyotard argues, is that the sciences face two\ncrises: one of representation, that is, that it cannot be held naively\nthat its models present to human subjects an accurate view of the\nobjective world, instead of paradigms in which only certain views of\nthe world fit and which, within a few years, can be completely\noverturned. Like any other particular kind of knowledge, e.g., a\nreligious or philosophical text, science is unable to move to\ntranscend its particular modes of discourse in order to claim anything\nbeyond its own sphere of competence and the rules by which its\nlanguage game is played. The second crisis is that science and other\nforms of knowledge are being put to the \u201ctechnological\u201d or\n\u201coperativity\u201d criterion (Postmodern Condition,\nxxv). In this way, the gaining of scientific knowledge is not an end\nin itself, in but is in service ultimately to economic motives that\nwill make certain processes more efficient and others redundant.\n\nThe narrative of The Postmodern Condition moves along two\ntemporal periods, one being modernity and its adherence to certain\nmetanarratives or means of organizing society\u2019s chaotic mix of\ndifferent language games, the other being the computerization of\nknowledge that occurred from the 1950s forward. This would become what\nis now called the \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d\neconomy, and Lyotard is one of those political thinkers who recognized a changeover\nfrom state-centered forms of liberalism to the neo-liberal,\nlaissez-faire deregulation of economies just before the Reagan and\nThatcher victories in the United States and United Kingdom. This\ncomputerization of knowledge has not just sped up how knowledge is\ntransferred, but what we think knowledge is, especially as the\nsciences are put almost wholly in service of supplying patents and\nknow-how for corporations. Lyotard avers that the old model of the\nlearning of knowledge as a means for making citizens and free agents\nof individuals is falling away as knowledge is exteriorized from any\nparticular individual knowers, and what is considered knowledge will\nonly be that which can be translated into computerizable language.\n\u201cWe can predict that anything in the constituted body of\nknowledge that is not translatable in this way will be\nabandoned\u201d, he writes, \u201cand that the direction of new\nresearch will be dictated by the possibility\u201d (Postmodern\nCondition, 4). Where before nation-states scrambled in\ncompetition for resources, what is now at stake are\n\u201cinformational commodit[ies]\u201d, small packets of\ninformation to be gained and traded under conditions where maximal\nefficiency is given absolute privilege (Postmodern Condition,\n5). Universities, then, will soon give up their roles in providing\ntraining (what the Germans call Bildung), instead preparing\ntheir students for becoming managers and creating these packets of\ninformation. No doubt, Lyotard was not the only one to see these\nchanges coming, but his prescience is notable nonetheless. At the same\ntime, since multinational corporations are best suited to commodify\ninformation at vast scales, the nation-state will lose its central\npolitical place and indeed purposely abdicate its role in managing\nnational economies. This reduction of knowledge to that which is\neasily translatable and understandable, of course, is what drives\nglobalization, and the leading economies, as Lyotard notes, will not\nbe those engaged in manufacturing traditional commodities but instead\nthose created and utilized through modern computing. \n\n\nKnowledge in the form of an informational commodity indispensable to\nproductive power is already, and will continue to be, a\nmajor\u2014perhaps the major\u2014stake in the worldwide competition\nfor power. (Postmodern Condition, 5) \n\n\nOne need only see the decimation of the U.S.\u2019s rust belt\ncommunities and the outsized economic and political role of Silicon\nValley and the banking sectors in London and New York as proof of\nLyotard\u2019s claims. But these changes have another effect as well:\nthese centers adjudicate what knowledge is, and one need only witness\noften fruitless attempts by humanities departments to prove themselves\nvaluable to employers in the digital economy as evidence of this.\n\nLyotard offers that the postmodern, as he sees it, ought to look for\nwhat is irreducible to commodification, that which is unpresentable\nwithin the \u201crealism\u201d of today (Postmodern\nCondition, 73\u20139). That which is taken to be real and most\nnatural is the formation of knowledge in terms understandable by\ncapitalist economics and its modes of efficiency. Lyotard, then,\nargues for forms of avant-gardism that seek what is unpresentable in\nthe present. Books by James Joyce (1882\u20131941), no doubt, can be treated like a commodity like any other, but\nopen up onto a plurality of meanings. One could read Joyce\u2019s\nUlysses (1922) in the service of having dinner party patter,\nbut such postmodern works ultimately evade any simple meaning to pass\nalong in such idle chatter. Here is how Lyotard famously defines the\npostmodern more positively than being merely a disbelief in\nmetanarratives:\n\n\nThe postmodern would be that which, in the modern, puts forward the\nunpresentable in presentation itself; that which denies itself the\nsolace of good forms, the consensus of a taste which would make it\npossible to share collectively the nostalgia for the unattainable;\nthat which searches for new presentations, not in order to enjoy them\nbut in order to impart a stronger sense of the unpresentable. A\npostmodern artist or writer is in the position of a philosopher: the\ntext he writes, the work he produces are not in principle governed by\npre-established rules, and they cannot be judged according to a\ndetermining judgment, by applying familiar categories to the text.\n(Postmodern Condition, 81)\n\n\nIn sum, while there are a heterogeneity of language games through which\nwe pass, artists, writers, and philosophers make moves within those\nlanguage games\u2014say those said to govern what a novel\nis\u2014that disrupt and open those language games to what\n\u201cwill have been\u201d, as he puts it. That is, they open up new\nways of thinking that are unpresentable in current language games.\n\u201cTerror\u201d, as he understands it, is \u201ca fantasy to\nseize reality\u201d, that is to colonize or totalize all other\nlanguage games and their future possibilities under the regime of one\nlanguage game (e.g., the technocratic language game of efficiency\n[Postmodern Condition, 67]). On this flip side of this terror\nare those that are \u201cwitnesses to the unpresentable\u201d, who\nwish to \u201cactivate the difference\u201d beyond and between the\nplurality of language games that make up postmodern societies\n(Postmodern Condition, 82).\n\nPublished the same year as The Postmodern Condition,\nLyotard\u2019s Just Gaming (Au juste) is short, but\nnevertheless deserves its place among a canon of important\n20th-century texts on justice, along with his The Differend.\nAfter Libidinal Economy, through a series of shorter works,\nLyotard argued that we live again in pagan societies with many gods to\nbe worshipped. By this he means that we live among and through a\nvariety of language games (science, art, politics, and so on)\n(Just Gaming, 36). His main argument, though, is that\n\u201cwe judge without criteria\u201d (Just Gaming, 14),\nthat is, there are no ontological or theoretical foundations for our\nethical and political claims for justice (Just Gaming, 44).\nIn this way, he radicalizes David Hume\u2019s (1711\u20131776) claim\nthat one cannot derive an \u201cought\u201d from an\n\u201cis\u201d. Just because there is a certain set of circumstances\nthat we can denotate does not prescribe for us what to do in light of\nthose conditions. Lyotard\u2019s answers in this set of interviews to\nhis interlocutor, Jean-Loup Th\u00e9baud, the editor of the French\njournal L\u2019esprit, attempt to thread a tricky political\nneedle: he recognizes that in postmodernity, there is no\nmetanarrative, no onto-theology, as Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976)\nwould call it, that can ground prescriptive statements. Yet, leaving\nbehind any foundation for prescriptive statements does not leave us\nunable to speak to what is just and unjust. For Lyotard, following\nEmmanuel Levinas (1906\u20131995), we are nothing but the receivers\nof obligations. For Levinas, that meant that ethics was first\nphilosophy and we were always passive to the Other who came before us.\nBut Lyotard argues, though, that ethics cannot be first philosophy,\nbut is but one language game among others. And yet it is not\nnothing, since we are pulled into the pragmatics and practice\nof this particular language game that calls on us to make judgments.\nWhat is unjust, Lyotard avers,\n\n\noccur[s] if the pragmatics of obligation, that is, the possibility of\ncontinuing to play the game of the just, were excluded. That is what\nis unjust. Not the opposite of the just, but that which prohibits that\nthe question of the just and the unjust be, and remain, raised. Thus,\nobviously, all terror, annihilation, massacre, etc., or their threat,\nare, by definition, unjust. (Just Gaming, 66\u20137)\n\n\nIn this way, there can be prescriptives after the \u201cdeath of\nGod\u201d, as Nietzsche called it, and the era of paganism that arose\nin its place (Just Gaming, 36). What is unjust is the violent\nsilencing of those raising claims to justice and disallowing them from\nmaking prescriptive claims, such as those colonized and left unheard\nby hegemonic powers.\n\nFor Lyotard, there is \u201cno knowledge in the matter of\nethics\u201d, nor is there a theoretical truth to adhere to in\npolitics. Rather, politics is a matter of a diversity of opinions, as\nthe non-Platonic Greeks believed, and is about nothing but this\nplurality of opinions. The ability to judge is a \u201cpower to\ninvent criteria\u201d, that is, create new rules not recognized by\nthe dominant modes of thinking politics. This claim brings\nLyotard\u2019s thinking of the political close to Hannah\nArendt\u2019s thinking of action and her notion of \u201cthinking\nwithout banisters\u201d after modernity\u2019s loss of authority.\nPolitics, she believed, became ideological at best and totalitarian at\nworst if wedded to notions of truth, such as involved in the\nmetanarratives of Marxist economic theory and its inexorable laws of\nhistory, or the racist theories of Nazism. The task, for Lyotard, is\nto see that questions of justice and prescriptive language games are\nnot simply about obeying laws. Rather, the task is to develop an\nattunement to the plurality of opinions and language games. \u201cWe\nhave to judge case by case\u201d, he avers, pointing to Aristotelian\nphron\u0113sis or practical wisdom as a model, but without an\noverarching community telos as in Aristotle\u2019s (384\u2013422\nBCE) Nichomachean Ethics (Just Gaming, 47). Even\nsuch seemingly universal prescriptions, such as \u201cthou shall not\nkill\u201d, are anything but, since exceptions are invariably made\nconcerning those lives that are to be taken in terms of the death\npenalty or in war. The point, then, is not that Lyotard\u2019s\n\u201cpagan\u201d ethics and politics leads to irresponsibility, but\nthe opposite. If it were just a matter of having a sure knowledge or\nabsolute set of laws to follow, then politics would be pre-programmed\nand there would be no judgment worthy of the name.\n",
