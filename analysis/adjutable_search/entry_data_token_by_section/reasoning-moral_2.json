    "main_text": "The Philosophical Importance of Moral Reasoning || Situating Moral Reasoning\n1.3 Situating Moral Reasoning\n\nThe topic of moral reasoning lies in between two other commonly\naddressed topics in moral philosophy. On the one side, there is the\nfirst-order question of what moral truths there are, if any. For\ninstance, are there any true general principles of morality, and if\nso, what are they? At this level utilitarianism competes with\nKantianism, for instance, and both compete with anti-theorists of\nvarious stripes, who recognize only particular truths about morality\n(Clarke & Simpson 1989). On the other side, a quite different sort\nof question arises from seeking to give a metaphysical grounding for\nmoral truths or for the claim that there are none. Supposing there are\nsome moral truths, what makes them true? What account can be\ngiven of the truth-conditions of moral statements? Here arise familiar\nquestions of\n moral skepticism\n and\n moral relativism;\n here, the idea of \u201ca reason\u201d is wielded by many hoping to\ndefend a non-skeptical moral metaphysics (e.g., Smith 2013). The topic\nof moral reasoning lies in between these two other familiar topics in\nthe following simple sense: moral reasoners operate with what they\ntake to be morally true but, instead of asking what makes\ntheir moral beliefs true, they proceed responsibly to attempt to\nfigure out what to do in light of those considerations. The\nphilosophical study of moral reasoning concerns itself with the nature\nof these attempts. \n\nThese three topics clearly interrelate. Conceivably, the relations\nbetween them would be so tight as to rule out any independent interest\nin the topic of moral reasoning. For instance, if all that could\nusefully be said about moral reasoning were that it is a matter of\nattending to the moral facts, then all interest would devolve upon the\nquestion of what those facts are \u2013 with some residual focus on\nthe idea of moral attention (McNaughton 1988). Alternatively, it might\nbe thought that moral reasoning is simply a matter of applying the\ncorrect moral theory via ordinary modes of deductive and empirical\nreasoning. Again, if that were true, one\u2019s sufficient goal would\nbe to find that theory and get the non-moral facts right. Neither of\nthese reductive extremes seems plausible, however. Take the potential\nreduction to getting the facts right, first. \n\nContemporary advocates of the importance of correctly perceiving the\nmorally relevant facts tend to focus on facts that we can perceive\nusing our ordinary sense faculties and our ordinary capacities of\nrecognition, such as that this person has an infection or\nthat this person needs my medical help. On such a footing, it\nis possible to launch powerful arguments against the claim that moral\nprinciples undergird every moral truth (Dancy 1993) and for the claim\nthat we can sometimes perfectly well decide what to do by acting on\nthe reasons we perceive instinctively \u2013 or as we have been\ntrained \u2013 without engaging in any moral reasoning. Yet this is\nnot a sound footing for arguing that moral reasoning, beyond\nsimply attending to the moral facts, is always unnecessary. On the\ncontrary, we often find ourselves facing novel perplexities and moral\nconflicts in which our moral perception is an inadequate guide. In\naddressing the moral questions surrounding whether society ought to\nenforce surrogate-motherhood contracts, for instance, the scientific\nand technological novelties involved make our moral perceptions\nunreliable and shaky guides. When a medical researcher who has noted\nan individual\u2019s illness also notes the fact that diverting\nresources to caring, clinically, for this individual would inhibit the\nprogress of my research, thus harming the long-term health chances of\nfuture sufferers of this illness, he or she comes face to face\nwith conflicting moral considerations. At this juncture, it is far\nless plausible or satisfying simply to say that, employing one\u2019s\nordinary sensory and recognitional capacities, one sees what is to be\ndone, both things considered. To posit a special faculty of moral\nintuition that generates such overall judgments in the face of\nconflicting considerations is to wheel in a deus ex machina.\nIt cuts inquiry short in a way that serves the purposes of fiction\nbetter than it serves the purposes of understanding. It is plausible\ninstead to suppose that moral reasoning comes in at this point\n(Campbell & Kumar 2012). \n\nFor present purposes, it is worth noting, David Hume and the moral\nsense theorists do not count as short-circuiting our understanding of\nmoral reasoning in this way. It is true that Hume presents himself,\nespecially in the Treatise of Human Nature, as a disbeliever\nin any specifically practical or moral reasoning. In doing so,\nhowever, he employs an exceedingly narrow definition of\n\u201creasoning\u201d (Hume 2000, Book I, Part iii, sect. ii). For\npresent purposes, by contrast, we are using a broader working gloss of\n\u201creasoning,\u201d one not controlled by an ambition to parse\nout the relative contributions of (the faculty of) reason and of the\npassions. And about moral reasoning in this broader sense, as\nresponsible thinking about what one ought to do, Hume has many\ninteresting things to say, starting with the thought that\nmoral reasoning must involve a double correction of\nperspective (see\n section 2.4)\n adequately to account for the claims of other people and of the\nfarther future, a double correction that is accomplished with the aid\nof the so-called \u201ccalm passions.\u201d\n\nIf we turn from the possibility that perceiving the facts aright will\ndisplace moral reasoning to the possibility that applying the correct\nmoral theory will displace \u2013 or exhaust \u2013 moral reasoning,\nthere are again reasons to be skeptical. One reason is that moral\ntheories do not arise in a vacuum; instead, they develop against a\nbroad backdrop of moral convictions. Insofar as the first potentially\nreductive strand, emphasizing the importance of perceiving moral\nfacts, has force \u2013 and it does have some \u2013 it also tends\nto show that moral theories need to gain support by systematizing or\naccounting for a wide range of moral facts (Sidgwick 1981). As in most\nother arenas in which theoretical explanation is called for, the\ndegree of explanatory success will remain partial and open to\nimprovement via revisions in the theory (see\n section 2.6).\n Unlike the natural sciences, however, moral theory is an endeavor\nthat, as John Rawls once put it, is \u201cSocratic\u201d in that it\nis a subject pertaining to actions \u201cshaped by\nself-examination\u201d (Rawls 1971, 48f.). If this observation is\ncorrect, it suggests that the moral questions we set out to answer\narise from our reflections about what matters. By the same token\n\u2013 and this is the present point \u2013 a moral theory is\nsubject to being overturned because it generates concrete implications\nthat do not sit well with us on due reflection. This being so, and\ngranting the great complexity of the moral terrain, it seems highly\nunlikely that we will ever generate a moral theory on the basis of\nwhich we can serenely and confidently proceed in a deductive way to\ngenerate answers to what we ought to do in all concrete cases. This\nconclusion is reinforced by a second consideration, namely that\ninsofar as a moral theory is faithful to the complexity of the moral\nphenomena, it will contain within it many possibilities for conflicts\namong its own elements. Even if it does deploy some priority rules,\nthese are unlikely to be able to cover all contingencies. Hence, some\nmoral reasoning that goes beyond the deductive application of the\ncorrect theory is bound to be needed. \n\nIn short, a sound understanding of moral reasoning will not take the\nform of reducing it to one of the other two levels of moral philosophy\nidentified above. Neither the demand to attend to the moral facts nor\nthe directive to apply the correct moral theory exhausts or\nsufficiently describes moral reasoning. \n",
