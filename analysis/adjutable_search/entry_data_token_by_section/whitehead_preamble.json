    "main_text": "\n\nAlfred North Whitehead (1861\u20131947) was a British mathematician\nand philosopher best known for his work in mathematical logic and the\nphilosophy of science. In collaboration with Bertrand Russell, he\nco-authored the landmark three-volume Principia Mathematica\n(1910, 1912, 1913). Later, he was instrumental in pioneering the\napproach to metaphysics now known as process philosophy.\n\nAlthough there are important continuities throughout his career,\nWhitehead\u2019s intellectual life is often divided into three main\nperiods. The first corresponds roughly to his time at Cambridge from\n1884 to 1910. It was during these years that he worked primarily on\nissues in mathematics and logic. It was also during this time that he\ncollaborated with Russell. The second main period, from 1910 to 1924,\ncorresponds roughly to his time at London. During these years\nWhitehead concentrated mainly on issues in physics, the philosophy of\nscience, and the philosophy of education. The third main period\ncorresponds roughly to his time at Harvard from 1924 onward. It was\nduring this time that he worked primarily on issues in\nmetaphysics.\n",
