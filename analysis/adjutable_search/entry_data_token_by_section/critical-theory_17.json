    "main_text": "Critical Concepts || Emancipation\n3.4 Emancipation\n\nFrankfurt School critical theory inherits its emancipatory orientation\nfrom Marx, in the sense that it aims not only to understand, but also\nto contribute to a radical transformation of the social world that is\nalready under way, and the commitment to real emancipation as\nrequiring a radical, irreducibly social and political transformation\nthat overcomes the fundamental contradictions of modern society\ninstead of partial or local reforms aimed at surface-level symptoms.\nEmancipation is thus understood as liberation, including\nself-liberation, from domination by social, political, and economic\npowers, both personal and structural. Against this background,\nhowever, critical theorists have given different accounts of what\nemancipation is, what it requires, and how much can be said about it\nas a process and as an aim or state. While some (Horkheimer 1937a,\nHabermas 1968b) have thought of emancipation as a process of\nenlightenment and self-reflection that would allow for the realization\nof a rational organization of society, others thought of emancipation\nas sensual liberation (Marcuse 1969), or as emancipation from the\n(internalized) destructive imperatives of capitalism towards a state\n\u201cof lying on water and looking peacefully at the sky\u201d\n(Adorno 1951c [2005, 157]).\n\nAt the same time, and insofar as the working class has been\nintegrated, fragmented, or at least reconstituted, it has become\nincreasingly less clear who is to be emancipated (or self-emancipated)\nfrom which forms of domination and how. The challenges to the\npossibility of emancipation include reflections on the potentially\noverblown ideals of autonomy, sovereignty, and transparency that seem\nto underlie it (Laclau 1992), the limits of active self-transformation\nunder conditions in which subjects have been shaped by power-ridden\nforms of subjectivation (Allen 2015), and the prospects of overcoming\ncapitalism given the apparent lack of any clear and viable\nalternative. Today, critical theorists also face the challenge of\nreorienting the emancipatory project in the face of a catastrophic\nclimate crisis that seems to privilege adaptation, mitigation, and\nsheer survival over utopian visions of emancipation that have also\nserved historically as a pretext for an extractive and dominating\nrelation to nature (Brown 2022).\n\nIn light of these challenges, a critical theory that wishes to hold on\nto its emancipatory orientation will need to articulate emancipation\nas an immanent possibility that is enabled and in some ways required\nby unprecedented historical developments. Whether in doing so it can\nbuild on the presumption of an emancipatory interest of the oppressed\nthat theorists from Marx and Horkheimer to Habermas and Honneth (2017)\nhave sought to identify remains contested. But thinking of\nemancipation as a second-order process that aims at enabling\ncollective practices of self-determination over and against the\nobstacles picked out by concepts such as alienation, reification, and\nideology, rather than as a substantial ideal or positive utopian\nvision of emancipation to be attained, might provide a starting point.\nInsofar as critical theory continues to see the existing social order\nas one of structurally entrenched domination, exploitation, and\nalienation, it will also continue to rely on some notion of an\nemancipatory process that points beyond those structures, even if this\nprocess is invariably plural, non-teleological, open-ended, and\nnegative in orientation.\n",
