    "main_text": "Analytical Jurisprudence and Legal Positivism\n2. Analytical Jurisprudence and Legal Positivism\n\nEarly in his career, Austin came under the influence of Jeremy\nBentham, and Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism is evident (though with\nsome differences) in the work for which Austin is best known today. On\nAustin\u2019s reading of utilitarianism, Divine will is equated with\nUtilitarian principles: \u201cThe commands which God has revealed we\nmust gather from the terms wherein they are promulg[ate]d. The command\nwhich he has not revealed, we must construe by the principle of\nutility\u201d (Austin 1873: Lecture IV, p. 160; see also Austin 1832:\nLecture II, p. 41). This particular reading of utilitarianism,\nhowever, has had little long-term influence, though it seems to have\nbeen the part of his work that received the most attention in his own\nday (Rumble 1995: p. xx). Some have also seen Austin as being one of\nthe early advocates of \u201crule utilitarianism\u201d (e.g., Austin\n1832: Lecture II, p. 42, where Austin urges that we analyze not the\nutility of particular acts, but that of \u201cclass[es] of\naction\u201d). Additionally, Austin early on shared many of the ideas\nof the Benthamite philosophical radicals; he was \u201ca strong\nproponent of modern political economy, a believer in Hartleian\nmetaphysics, and a most enthusiastic Malthusian\u201d (Rumble 1985:\npp. 16\u201317). Austin was to lose most of his \u201cradical\u201d\ninclinations as he grew older.\n\nAustin\u2019s importance to legal theory lies elsewhere\u2014his\ntheorizing about law was novel at four different levels of generality.\nFirst, he was arguably the first writer to approach the theory of law\nanalytically (as contrasted with approaches to law more grounded in\nhistory or sociology, or arguments about law that were secondary to\nmore general moral and political theories). Analytical jurisprudence\nemphasizes the analysis of key concepts, including \u201claw,\u201d\n\u201c(legal) right,\u201d \u201c(legal) duty,\u201d and\n\u201clegal validity.\u201d Though analytical jurisprudence has been\nchallenged by some in recent years (e.g., Leiter 2007, Leiter and\nEtchemendy 2021, Postema 2021 [Other Internet Resources]), it remains\nthe dominant approach to discussing the nature of law. Analytical\njurisprudence, an approach to theorizing about law, has sometimes been\nconfused with what the American legal realists (an influential group\nof theorists prominent in the early decades of the 20th century)\ncalled \u201clegal formalism\u201d\u2014a narrow approach to how\njudges should decide cases. The American legal realists saw Austin in\nparticular, and analytical jurisprudence in general, as their\nopponents in their critical and reform-minded efforts (e.g., Sebok\n1998: pp. 65\u201369). In this, the realists were simply mistaken;\nunfortunately, it is a mistake that can still be found in some\ncontemporary legal commentators (see Bix 1999, 903\u2013919, for\ndocumentation).\n\nSecond, Austin\u2019s work should be seen against a background where\nmost English judges and commentators saw common-law reasoning (the\nincremental creation or modification of law through judicial\nresolution of particular disputes) as supreme, as declaring existing\nlaw, as discovering the requirements of \u201cReason,\u201d as the\nimmemorial wisdom of popular \u201ccustom.\u201d Such\n(Anglo-American) theories about common law reasoning fit with a larger\ntradition of theorizing about law (which had strong roots in\ncontinental European thought\u2014e.g., the historical jurisprudence\nof theorists like Karl Friedrich von Savigny (1975)): the idea that\ngenerally law did or should reflect community mores,\n\u201cspirit,\u201d or custom. In general, one might look at many of\nthe theorists prior to Austin as exemplifying an approach that was\nmore \u201ccommunity-oriented\u201d\u2014law as arising from\nsocietal values or needs, or expressive of societal customs or\nmorality. By contrast, Austin\u2019s is one of the first, and one of\nthe most distinctive, theories that views law as being \u201cimperium\noriented\u201d\u2014viewing law as mostly the rules imposed from\nabove from certain authorized (pedigreed) sources. More\n\u201ctop-down\u201d theories of law, like that of Austin, better\nfit the more centralized governments (and the modern political\ntheories about government) of modern times (Cotterrell 2003: pp.\n21\u201377).\n\nThird, within analytical jurisprudence, Austin was the first\nsystematic exponent of a view of law known as \u201clegal\npositivism.\u201d Most of the important theoretical work on law prior\nto Austin had treated jurisprudence as though it were merely a branch\nof moral theory or political theory: asking how should the state\ngovern? (and when were governments legitimate?), and under what\ncircumstances did citizens have an obligation to obey the law? Austin\nspecifically, and legal positivism generally, offered a quite\ndifferent approach to law: as an object of \u201cscientific\u201d\nstudy (Austin 1879: pp. 1107\u20131108), dominated neither by\nprescription nor by moral evaluation. Subtle jurisprudential questions\naside, Austin\u2019s efforts to treat law systematically gained\npopularity in the late 19th century among English lawyers who wanted\nto approach their profession, and their professional training, in a\nmore serious and rigorous manner (Hart 1955: pp. xvi\u2013xviii;\nCotterrell 2003: pp. 74\u201377; Stein 1988: pp. 231\u2013244).\n\nLegal positivism asserts (or assumes) that it is both possible and\nvaluable to have a morally neutral descriptive (or\n\u201cconceptual\u201d\u2014though this is not a term Austin used)\ntheory of law. (The main competitor to legal positivism, in\nAustin\u2019s day as in our own, has been natural law theory.) Legal\npositivism does not deny that moral and political criticism of legal\nsystems is important, but insists that a descriptive or conceptual\napproach to law is valuable, both on its own terms and as a necessary\nprelude to criticism.\n\n(The term \u201clegal positivism\u201d is sometimes used more\nbroadly to include the position that we should construct or modify our\nconcept of law to remove moral criteria of legal validity; or to\ninclude a prescription that moral values should not be used in\njudicial decision-making (Schauer 2010\u2014see the Other Internet\nResources). I do not think anything turns on whether the term is used\nmore broadly or more narrowly, as long as it is clear which sense is\nbeing used. Additionally, while Schauer claims (2010) that Austin\ncould be seen as supporting some of the views associated with the\nbroader understanding of \u201clegal positivism\u201d, there is need\nfor more evidence and argument before the point should be\ngranted.)\n\nThere were theorists prior to Austin who arguably offered views\nsimilar to legal positivism or who at least foreshadowed legal\npositivism in some way. Among these would be Thomas Hobbes, with his\namoral view of laws as the product of Leviathan (Hobbes 1996); David\nHume, with his argument for separating \u201cis\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d (which has been taken by some as a sharp criticism\nfor some forms of natural law theory, those views that purported to\nderive moral truths from statements about human nature, Hume 1739,\nSection 3.1.1, but see Chilovi and Wodak 2021, raising questions about\nthe relevance of Hume\u2019s views here for either natural law theory\nor legal positivism); and Jeremy Bentham, with his attacks on judicial\nlawmaking and on those commentators, like Sir William Blackstone, who\njustified such lawmaking with natural-law-like justifications (Bentham\n1789).\n\nAustin\u2019s famous formulation of what could be called the\n\u201cdogma\u201d of legal positivism is as follows:\n\nThe existence of law is one thing; its merit or demerit is another.\nWhether it be or be not is one enquiry; whether it be or be not\nconformable to an assumed standard, is a different enquiry. A law,\nwhich actually exists, is a law, though we happen to dislike it, or\nthough it vary from the text, by which we regulate our approbation and\ndisapprobation. (Austin 1832: Lecture V, p. 157)\n\n\n(While Austin saw himself as criticizing natural law theory, a view\nshared by most of the legal positivists who followed him, the extent\nto which the two schools disagree, and the location of their\ndisagreement, remains a matter sharply contested (e.g., Finnis 2000a,\n2000b.))\n\nAndrew Halpin has argued (Halpin 2013) that Austin shaped the nature\nof modern analytical jurisprudence and legal positivism by his choice\nto exclude legal reasoning from his discussion of\n\u201cjurisprudence.\u201d A greater focus on legal reasoning,\nHalpin argues, would have made it harder to claim a clear separation\nof law \u201cas it is\u201d and law \u201cas it ought to be.\u201d\nHalpin points out that prominent later legal positivists have followed\nAustin, either in speaking little about legal reasoning (Hans Kelsen,\nand, to some extent, H. L. A. Hart), or speaking about the topic at\nlength, but treating the issue as sharply separate from their theories\nof (the nature of) law.\n\nFourth, Austin\u2019s version of legal positivism, a \u201ccommand\ntheory of law\u201d (which will be detailed in the next section), was\nalso, for a time, quite influential. Austin\u2019s theory had\nsimilarities with views developed by Jeremy Bentham, whose theory\ncould also be characterized as a \u201ccommand theory.\u201d\nBentham, in a posthumously published work, defined law as an:\n\nassemblage of signs declarative of a volition conceived or adopted by\nthe sovereign in a state, concerning the conduct to be\nobserved in a certain case by a certain person or class of\npersons, who in the case in question are or are supposed to be subject\nto his power: such volition trusting for its accomplishment to the\nexpectation of certain events which it is intended such declaration\nshould upon occasion be a means of bringing to pass, and the prospect\nof which it is intended should act as a motive upon those whose\nconduct is in question (Bentham 1970: p. 1).\n\n\nHowever, Austin\u2019s command theory was more influential than\nBentham\u2019s, because the latter\u2019s jurisprudential writings\ndid not appear in an even-roughly systematic form until well after\nAustin\u2019s work had already been published, with Bentham\u2019s\nmost systematic discussion only appearing posthumously, late in the\n20th century (Bentham 1970, 1996; Cotterrell 2003: p. 50).\n",
