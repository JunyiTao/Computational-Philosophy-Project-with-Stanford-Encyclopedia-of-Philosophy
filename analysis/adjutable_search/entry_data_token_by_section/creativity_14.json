    "main_text": "Creativity and Artificial Intelligence\n6. Creativity and Artificial Intelligence\n\nJust as we find in psychology and neuroscience, there is a rich\nresearch literature on creativity in artificial intelligence and\ncomputer science, with devoted journals, special issues, and\nconferences (The Journal of Artificial Creativity, The\nJournal of Creative Music Systems, Digital Creativity,\nMinds and Machines special issue on Computational Creativity\n[Gerv\u00e1s et al. 2010], The International Conference on\nComputational Creativity). The question we focus on here is\nwhether a computer could be creative. As background, it is\nworth considering how theorists approached the analogous question as\nto whether a computer could think.\n\nAlthough theorists of various kinds have asked whether machines can\nthink since at least the early modern period, the most important\nconceptual innovations on the topic came from Alan Turing, centering\naround his 1950 paper \u201cComputing machinery and\nintelligence\u201d. Here Turing provided a number of groundbreaking\ninsights. Perhaps most familiar is Turing\u2019s \u201cimitation\ngame\u201d, now commonly known as \u201cthe Turing Test\u201d. In\nbrief, the test involved an unknowing interrogator who could ask an\nopen-ended series of questions of both a human and a computer. If the\ninterrogator could not distinguish computer from human, Turing\npostulated that this would suffice to illustrate genuine intelligence.\nThere is no shortage of controversy regarding the aptness of the test\nfor intelligence, and arguably no computer has yet passed it. (For\nmore thorough discussion of Turing and the Turing test see entries on\n Alan Turing,\n Turing machines, and\n the Turing test).\n\nSuccessful performance in Turing\u2019s game would require remarkable\nbehavioral flexibility. And it is highly operational: specify a\nthreshold for imitation, and then simply allow the interrogator to ask\nquestions, then assess performance. If the behavior is sufficiently\nflexible to fool the interrogator, Turing claimed, the behavior was\nintelligent and, therefore, the computer intelligent.\n\nWith this background in mind, what are some of the cases in AI\nresearch lauded as success cases, and how do they align with some of\nTuring\u2019s criteria?\n\nMany of the familiar success cases are highly specialized. Deep\nBlue defeated chess master Garry Kasparov (Kasparov &\nGreengard 2017); some language processing systems managed to navigate\nsocial contexts such as ordering from a menu at a restaurant (Schank\n& Abelson 1977); AlphaGo more recently defeated the world\nchampion Go player. This specialization is both a virtue and a\nlimitation. On the one hand, achievement in such a specialized domain\nimplies an exceptional amount of detailed memory and skill. On the\nother hand, this knowledge and skill does not generalize. Neither\nDeep Blue nor Alpha Go could successfully order from\na menu, along with countless other basic human tasks. Put in terms of\nTuring\u2019s imitation game, these systems would fail miserably to\nfool a human, or even remotely imitate one (except for their\nperformance in a very narrow domain). What about systems such as\nIBM\u2019s Watson, which famously won (against humans) on\nthe television game show Jeopardy! This performance is more\ngeneral, since topics on the show vary widely, and seemed to require\nboth language comprehension and some minimal reasoning skills (see\nentry on\n artificial intelligence\n for extended discussion). Even so, Watson\u2019s capabilities are\nstill quite limited: it cannot make fluid conversation \u201cin real\ntime\u201d and is largely insensitive to temporal and other factors\nthat come with context.\n\nThere are many, many more examples of computational systems that\ndisplay sophisticated behavior, from the highly specialized to the\nmore general. On the language processing front, very recent AI systems\nsuch as\n OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT\n and\n Google\u2019s LaMDA\n significantly outperform the systems described above. To be clear,\nthese are remarkable achievements that display substantial complexity\nand, it appears in some cases, significant flexibility\u2014features\nTuring highlighted in characteristically human behaviors. But this\nalso underscores a distinction, often invoked by critics of artificial\nintelligence research. There is a difference between a\ncomputer\u2019s displaying or merely imitating an intelligent\nbehavior, and a computer\u2019s instantiating intelligence through\nsuch behavior. And the critic will say, even if a computer behaves\nas if it is intelligent, this is just modeling or simulating\nintelligence. The greater ambition, though, is \u201cgenuine\nartificial intelligence\u201d, a system that actually\nthinks. John Searle refers to this as the distinction between\n\u201cweak AI\u201d and \u201cstrong AI\u201d, respectively.\n\n\nWeak AI: Could a computer behave as\nif it thinks?\nStrong AI: Could a computer genuinely think?\n\n\n\nThe general worry here is that however sophisticated a system\u2019s\nbehavior may appear \u201cfrom the outside\u201d, for all we know it\nmay just be a \u201chollow shell\u201d (Haugeland 1981 [1997]; Clark\n2001). The worry has then been fleshed out in various ways by\nspecifying what is missing from the shell, as it were. Here are three\nstandard such candidates. And, again, in each case however\nsophisticated the computer\u2019s behavior may appear it still may be\nlacking in any or all of the following. First, the computer may lack\nconsciousness. Second, the computer may lack any\nunderstanding of the symbols over which it computes (Searle\n1980). Finally, the computer may operate without caring about\nits own behavior or, as John Haugeland colorfully puts it, without\n\u201cgiving a damn\u201d. In each case, any kind of response from\nthe ambitious AI researcher encounters the substantial challenges that\ncome with theorizing mental phenomena such as consciousness,\nunderstanding, linguistic competence, and emotion. (Turing 1950, for\ninstance, recognized but largely eschewed these kinds of topics).\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to ask whether computers could think, and another\nto ask whether they could be creative. And just as the prospect of\nartificial intelligence or thinking divides into two\nquestions\u2014of weak AI and strong AI\u2014we may distinguish two\nanalogous questions about artificial creativity, which we\u2019ll\nrefer to as the questions of \u201cweak AC\u201d and \u201cstrong\nAC\u201d, respectively. To begin with the former:\n\n\nWeak AC: Could a computer behave as\nif it\u2019s creative?\n\n\n\nSomething behaves as if it\u2019s creative if it produces things\nwhich are psychologically new (new to that thing) and\nvaluable. Arguably, a number of computers have already done\nthat.\n\nIn the 1970s, Harold Cohen began using computational technologies to\nproduce new drawings and paintings. The work of his computer painter,\nAaron, has exhibited at galleries such as the Tate and the Victoria\nand Albert Museum in London. David Cope\u2019s \u201cEMI\u201d\n(Experiments in Musical Intelligence) has composed musical works in\nthe style of various known composers and styles, even a full-length\nopera. Some of these works have been recorded and produced by bona\nfide record labels. Just search \u201cEmily Howell\u201d on Spotify\nor Apple Music and give it a listen (Cope 1996, 2006). Simon\nColton\u2019s The Painting Fool is an ongoing project,\ninvolving a software that abstracts phrases, images, and other items\nfrom newspaper articles and creates collage-style pieces. It has also\nproduced portraits, based on images of film characters, of the same\nindividual in different emotional states (see Painting Fool\nin\n Other Internet Resources;\n see Colton 2012 for theoretical discussion). Even more recently,\nthere have been explosive developments in generative art systems like\nDALL\u2022E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, VQGAN+CLIP. (For discussion\nsee Paul & Stokes 2021). In all of these cases, the relevant\noutputs of the computer program are new relative to its past\nproductions\u2014so they are psychologically (or behaviorally) novel,\nwhich again is all the novelty that creativity requires. And although\nhistorical novelty isn\u2019t required for creativity, it\u2019s\nworth noting that these products appear to be to be new in all of\nhistory as well.\n\nWhat about value? As noted above in\n \u00a72.1,\n some theorists reject the value condition, but even if value\nis required for creativity, that too is a condition these\ncomputer artworks seem to meet. Assessments of value can be\ncontroversial, but that is no less true for the outputs of human\ncreativity. The fact that these works are critically acclaimed,\nshowcased in prestigious galleries, and commissioned by selective\nrecord labels testifies to their artistic merit, and viewers find them\npleasing, interesting, and appealing, even before being apprised of\ntheir unusual origin. So it is reasonable to conclude computer\nprograms like the ones just described exhibit at least weak AC insofar\nas they produce works of valuable novelty, and one could cite many\nmore examples in the same vein.\n\nSome theorists have noted that, whether or not the original Turing\ntest is a good test for intelligence or thinking, we might adopt an\nanalogous test for creativity: If a computer can fool human observers\ninto thinking that it is a human creator, then it is in fact creative\n(Pease & Colton 2011; see also Chen 2020 for useful discussion of\nartificial creativity, including many additional examples of\nparticular cases, and so-called Dartmouth-based Turing tests). If we\nemploy this test, we might find ourselves with an unexpected\nconclusion: computers can be creative; in fact, some of them already\nare. But one might reasonably worry that the test is inadequate and\nthe conclusion is too quick (Berrar & Schuster 2014; Bringsjord et\nal. 2001). From the fact that a computer operates as if\nit\u2019s creative, one might argue, it doesn\u2019t follow that it\nreally is. Which brings us to our next question:\n\n\nStrong AC: Could a computer genuinely be\ncreative?\n\n\n\nThis obviously returns us to the question of what conditions something\nmust meet in order to count as being genuinely creative. And here we\nneed go beyond the outwardly observable product-features of novelty\nand value to consider the underlying processes of genuine creativity.\nAs we saw in\n \u00a72.2,\n theorists have variously proposed that in order for a process to\ncount as creative, it must be surprising, original,\nspontaneous, and/or agential. There is no consensus to\nappeal to here, but if any one of these conditions is indeed\nrequired for genuine creativity, then a computer could be genuinely\ncreative only to the extent that it executes processes which satisfy\nthat condition.\n\nThe classic statement of skepticism regarding the possibility of\ncomputer creativity is due to Lady Ada Lovelace who had this to say\nwhile remarking on \u201cthe Analytical Engine\u201d designed by her\nfriend Charles Babbage:\n\n\nIt is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas\nthat might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The\nAnalytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate\nanything. (Lovelace 1843, italics added)\n\n\nThough Lovelace does not frame her comments in terms of\n\u201ccreativity\u201d as such, she explicitly denied that a\ncomputer could satisfy at least one condition that is plausibly\nrequired for creativity, namely originality. A computer\ncannot be the originator, the author, or the creator of anything new,\nshe contends; it can only do what it is programmed to do. We cannot\nget anything out of a computer that has not already been programmed\ninto it. Further, Lovelace may also be interpreted as expressing or\nimplying doubt about whether a computer could satisfy the three other\nproposed requirements for genuine creativity. Insofar as a\ncomputer\u2019s outputs cannot be original, one might also suspect\nthat they cannot be surprising. The image of a machine\nstrictly following rules invokes precisely the kind of mechanical\nprocedure that is the antithesis of spontaneity. And it may\nseem that such a machine could not be a genuine agent either.\nThe problem isn\u2019t just that a computer can\u2019t produce\nanything original; it\u2019s that it deserves no credit for whatever\nit does produce. Any praise or blame for the outputs of a computer\nrightly go to the engineers and programmers who made the machine, not\nto the machine itself. While these points may be intuitive, at least\nsome of them are being challenged by modern technologies, which have\ncome a long way since Babbage\u2019s invention.\n\nConsider AlphaGo again. This is a \u201cdeep learning\u201d system,\nwhich involves two neural networks: a Policy network and a Value\nnetwork. Very briefly: The system is trained using a vast number of\nlegitimate moves made in actual games of Go played by professional\nhuman players (28.4 million moves from 160,000 games, to be precise;\nsee Silver et al. 2016 and Halina 2021). The network is further\ntrained, again using learning algorithms, by playing many games (some\n100 million) against previous versions of itself (in the sense of a\ndifferently weighted neural network). The weights of nodes in the\nnetwork are then adjusted by a learning algorithm that favors moves\nmade in winning games. The value network is trained over a subset of\nthese many games, with node weighting adjustments resulting in\nreliable probability assignments to moves vis-\u00e0-vis their\npotential to contribute to a win. Finally, the system employs a\nMonte Carlo search tree (MCT). Generally, this kind of\nalgorithm is designed to simulate a decision process to optimize\nsuccess given chosen parameters. In this case, the search algorithm\nselects a given path of moves, then adds some valid moves to this\npath, and then if this process does not terminate (end in win/loss),\nthe system performs a \u201crollout\u201d. A rollout essentially\nplays the game out for both players (using samples of possible moves)\nto its conclusion. The information that results from the MCT and\nprocessing by the value network are then fed back (back propagated)\ninto the system. This entire process (once the system is trained) is\nrapid and determines how AlphaGo \u201cdecides\u201d to move in any\ngiven game.\n\nHere are some things to note. AlphaGo\u2019s style of play is\nsurprising. As commentators have noted, it is starkly\nunconventional relative to standards of human play (Halina cites Baker\nand Hui 2017\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Indeed, Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player defeated by AlphaGo\nin 2016, remarked that AlphaGo\u2019s play revealed that much of\nhuman play is, contrary to prior common opinion, not creative after\nall\u2014intimating that at least some of the play of AlphaGo\nis. Note further that this system is flexible. While there\nare learning algorithms and rules that adjust network weights, the\nsystem is not mechanical or predictable in the same fashion as\nearlier, classical systems (including Deep Blue, for\nexample). In a recent paper, Marta Halina has made this argument\n(Halina 2021). She explicitly invokes Boden\u2019s characterization,\nwhich requires novelty, value, and surprise of creativity. Again, the\nnovelty and value should be plausibly attributed in this case.\nRegarding surprise, Halina suggests that it is AlphaGo\u2019s\nemployment of MCT that enables a kind of \u201cinsight\u201d,\nflexibility, and unpredictable results. She writes,\n\n\nIt is the exploration parameter that allows AlphaGo to go beyond its\ntraining, encouraging it to simulate moves outside of those\nrecommended by the policy network. As the search tree is constructed,\nthe system starts choosing moves with the highest \u201caction\nvalue\u201d to simulate, where the action value indicates how good a\nmove is based on the outcome of rollouts and value-network\nevaluations. (Halina 2021: 324)\n\n\nHalina grants that given its domain-specificity, as we have already\nnoted, this system\u2019s particular abilities do not generalize in a\nway that may be required to properly attribute genuine intelligence.\nBut she suggests that the complex use of the MCT search may amount to\n\u201cmental scenario building\u201d or, we might say, a kind of\nimagination. And insofar as this search algorithm technology can be\napplied to other systems in other domains, and imagination is a\ngeneral component of intelligence, perhaps here lies space for\ngeneralizability. AlphaGo also affords at least some reply to the\ntraditional Lovelace worry.\n\n\nArtificial systems do not act only according to preprogrammed rules\nhand-coded by engineers. Moreover, current deep-learning methods are\ncapable of producing systems that are superhuman in their abilities to\ndiscover novel and valuable solutions to problems within specific\ndomains. (Halina 2021: 327)\n\n\nIf this is right, then AlphaGo exhibits originality. Finally,\nthe flexibility with which this system operates may also satisfy\nKronfeldner\u2019s spontaneity requirement.\n\nSome of these same features are found in a related approach in AI,\nnamely research in evolutionary robotics. These systems also involve\nvarious forms of machine learning but in this case the learning is\ndistributed, as it were, across a population of individuals rather\nthan one individual. This approach can be understood, albeit\nimperfectly, as analogous to natural evolution. One begins, typically\nin computer simulation, with a population of agents. These agents are\ntypically identified with individual neural networks, the connections\nand weightings of which are random to start. Relative to some\ntask\u2014for instance, avoiding obstacles, collecting objects,\nperforming photo or phonotaxis\u2014a genetic algorithm\nassigns a fitness value to each individual agent after a certain\nperiod of time or number of trials. Fitter agents are typically\nfavored and used to generate the next population of agents. Also\nincluded in this generation are random mutation and\ngenetic crossover (digital breeding!). Although it can take\nhundreds of generations, this is a discovery approach to engineering\nor constructing a system that successfully performs a task; it is\n\u201cgradient descent learning\u201d (Clark 1996). In this\nbottom-up approach, no single individual, nor even an entire\npopulation, are in any strict sense programmed. Rather, successful\nagents have \u201clearned\u201d as a result of generations of\nrandomness, crossover, and small fitness improvements (and lots and\nlots of failures). Early success cases evolved robots that can follow\ntrails (Koza 1992), locomote in insect-fashion (Beer & Gallagher\n1992), guide themselves visually (Cliff, Husbands, & Harvey 1993),\nand collect garbage (Nolfi & Floreana 2000). See Bird and Stokes\n(2006, 2007) and Stokes and Bird (2008) for analysis and study of\ncreativity in the context of evolutionary robotics.\n\nThese systems most certainly produce novelty. Later, fit individuals\nachieve novelty at their aimed task relative to whole generations and\npopulations of previous agents. And this novelty is often surprising\nto the engineers and programmers that build them, indeed sometimes\neven unpredictably independent of any relevant task for individuals in\nthe population. There are many examples in the literature. Indeed\nLehman and others (2020) catalog a large range of cases where digital\nevolution surprises its creators, categorizing them in four\nrepresentative groups: \u201cmis-specified fitness functions\u201d,\n\u201cunintended debugging\u201d, \u201cexceeded experimenter\nexpectations\u201d, and \u201cconvergence with biology\u201d. Here\nis one now relatively famous example of the first type of case. In\nearly research in artificial life (A-Life), Karl Sims (1994) designed\nvirtual creatures that were supposed to learn to walk (as well as swim\nand jump) in a simulated environment. The fitness function assessed\nindividual agents on their average ground velocity across 10 seconds.\nSome of the fittest individuals to evolve were surprising: they grew\ntall and rigid and when they would fall over they would achieve high\nground velocity, thus maximizing fitness given the (mis)specified\nparameters in unpredicted ways.\n\nThis is but one example of how systems like these can evolve in\nunpredictable or surprising ways. This unpredictability has\noccurred not just in simulated robotics, but in embodied robotics as\nwell. In using a genetic algorithm to attempt to evolve oscillating\nsensors, researchers unintentionally evolved a radio antenna (Bird\n& Layzell 2002). This unexpected result arose from a combination\nof the particular algorithm used (which was intended) and various\nphysical features of the space such as proximity to a PC monitor\n(which the researchers had presumably deemed irrelevant but which the\nevolved system, in a sense, did not). And one might be further\ninclined to describe some of these achievements as creative (and not\njust in the trivial sense that they are original instances of robotic\nsuccess), since they also produce value, at least insofar as they are\nuseful at performing a task, whether it is locomoting or locating a\nsource of light or sensing radio waves.\n\nSome theorists in this domain might argue that these systems achieve\nspontaneity as well. Given the substantial inclusion of\nrandomness in the system\u2019s development\u2014both at the outset\nwhen the individual\u2019s neural networks are randomized and more\nimportantly with random mutation across populations\u2014it is\nintuitive to describe the system\u2019s as not following a\nmechanical procedure. Indeed, the way in which systems exploit fitness\nfunctions and data patterns further underscores this point. (Again,\nsee the rich catalog of cases offered by Lehman et al. 2020).\n\nOn the face of it, then, recent technologies in AI, evolutionary\nrobotics, and artificial life, seem to fulfill many of the conditions\nproposed for genuine creativity. These systems produce things that are\nnovel and valuable, and do so through computational processes that are\nplausibly surprising, original, and spontaneous. The one requirement\nwe have yet to address, however, is agency. Recall the\nsuggestion, implicit in Lovelace\u2019s remarks, that whatever a\ncomputer produces is to the credit of the programmer, not the\ncomputer. Notice that as sophisticated as current technologies in\nartificial creativity may be, presumably they are still not subject to\npraise or blame for what they do. If any beings are responsible for\nthe work of these programs, it still seems to be the programmers and\nengineers who make them, not the programs themselves. The programs\nthemselves do not seem to \u201cgive a damn\u201d. So, if the\ncreative process requires agency, arguably we have not yet created,\nprogrammed, or evolved a computational system that is really creative,\nhowever much they might appear to be. In the pursuit of strong AC,\nagency might be the final frontier (Paul & Stokes 2021).\n",
