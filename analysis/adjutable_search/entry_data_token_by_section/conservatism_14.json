    "main_text": "Critiques of conservatism || The coherence of particularist scepticism\n3.4 The coherence of particularist scepticism\n\nLord Hugh Cecil postulates within modern conservatism what he calls\ninnate conservatism: a psychological characteristic found in all\npeople to some degree (Cecil 1912). For C.D Broad, it has two\nsides:\n\n\nThe more worthy side [rational scepticism] [says] that social problems\nare so very complex that there is always a strong probability that\nsome factor has been overlooked in any scheme of change\u2026The\nless respectable side [mental inertia] is the dislike of novelty as\nsuch.\n\n\nHe continues:\n\n\nRational scepticism, as a motive for rejecting a scheme that offers to\nremove admitted evils, involves two applications of probability. The\nfirst is\u2026that social affairs are so complex that it is very\nimprobable that all the effects of a given social change have been\nforeseen. But\u2026we must have some ground for judging further that\nthe unforeseen effects are more likely to be bad than good\u2026this\njudgment cannot rest on the known nature of the effects of this\nparticular measure [but only] on some general proposition, such as: It\nis more probable that the unforeseen effects of any social change will\nbe bad than that they will be good. [There is] no reason to think\n[this]. (Broad 1913: 397)\n\n\nBroad is alluding to the fact that every philosophical standpoint must\nconfront the problem of how to treat its own defining claims, by its\nown lights. Examples would include whether Marxism is itself\nhistoricaly conditioned, and whether logical positivism\u2019s verification\nprinciple is itself verifiable. Conservatives declare that there are\nno general prescriptions, but must address the status of its own\ngeneral prescription, \u201cThere are no general prescriptions\u201d\n\n\nConservatism seems unduly pessimistic about the possibility of\nindividual, explicit knowledge of society, therefore. There are some\nthings about society that we can come to know\u2014and government\neconomic policy, for instance, seems justifiably dedicated to finding\nthem out. Conservatives must concede that radical change is sometimes\nacceptable; some major changes, for instance votes for women, are\ngood. These must be prepared for\u2014as they were in Britain in\n1918, compared with, say, 1832\u2014and preparing for change makes it\nless radical. What conservatives will insist is that revolutionary\nchange is unacceptable.\n",
