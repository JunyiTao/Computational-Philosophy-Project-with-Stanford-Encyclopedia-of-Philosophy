    "main_text": "Freedom to Will\n7. Freedom to Will\nThe second question regarding the relation between freedom and the\nwill that Locke takes to be significant is \u201cWhether a Man be\nat liberty to will which of the two he pleases, Motion or\nRest\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.25: 247). Consider a particular\naction A. What Locke is asking is whether an agent is free with\nrespect to the action of willing that A occur. For\nexample, suppose that I am sitting in a chair and that A is the\naction of walking to the fridge. Locke wants to know whether I am free\nwith respect to willing the action of walking to the fridge.\nMost commentators think that Locke\u2019s answer to this question\nis NO. The main evidence for this interpretation is what Locke says\nabout the question immediately after raising it:\nThis Question carries the absurdity of it so\nmanifestly in it self, that one might thereby sufficiently be\nconvinced, that Liberty concerns not the Will. (E5 II.xxi.25: 247)\nIt is tempting to suppose that the thought that \u201cLiberty\nconcerns not the Will\u201d is the thought that agents are not free\nto will, and that Locke is saying that we are driven to this thought\nbecause the second question is absurd, in the sense of demanding a\nnegative answer.\nBut it is difficult to make sense of what Locke goes on to say in\nII.xxi.25 if he is interpreted as answering the second question\nnegatively. Section 25 continues:\nFor to ask, whether a Man be at liberty to\nwill either Motion, or Rest; Speaking, or Silence; which he pleases,\nis to ask, whether a Man can will, what he wills; or\nbe pleased with what he is pleased with. (E1\u20135 II.xxi.25: 247)\nLocke says that the second question reduces to another that can be\nput in two different ways: whether a man can will what he wills, and\nwhether a man can be pleased with what pleases him. (The reason it can\nbe put in these two different ways, at least in E1, is that Locke\nthere adopts a desiderative theory of willing, according to which\nwilling an action is a matter of being more pleased with the action\nthan with its forbearance.) But asking whether a man can will what he\nwills, or whether a man can be pleased with what he is pleased with,\nis similar to asking whether a man can steal what he steals. And the\nanswer to all of these questions is: \u201cOF COURSE!\u201d\nIt is obvious that whatever it is that a\nman actually steals he can steal. Similarly, it\nis obvious that whatever it is that a man actually\nwills (or is actually pleased with) is something that he can\nwill (or can be pleased with). The reason is that it is a\nself-evident maxim (just as self-evident as the maxim that whatever\nis, is\u2014see E1\u20135 IV.vii.4: 592\u2013594) that whatever is actual\nis possible. Locke, it seems, wishes to answer the second question in\nthe affirmative! \nThis raises the issue of what Locke could possibly mean, then, when\nhe describes the second question as \u201cabsurd\u201d. One\npossibility is that, for Locke, a question counts as absurd not only\nwhen the answer to it is obviously in the negative (think:\n\u201cIs the will free?\u201d), but also when the answer to it\nis obviously in the affirmative (think: \u201cIs it possible\nfor you to do what you are actually doing?\u201d). But it also raises\nthe issue of why Locke would think that the second question actually\nreduces to an absurd question of the latter sort. One possible\nsolution derives from Locke\u2019s theory of freedom of action.  As\nwe have seen, Locke thinks that one is free with respect to\naction A if and only if (i) if one (actually) wills to\ndo A, then one can do A, and (ii) if one (actually)\nwills not to do A, then one can avoid doing A. Applying\nthis theory directly to the case in which A is the action\nof willing to do B, we arrive at the following: one is\nfree with respect to willing to do B if and only if (i) if one\n(actually) wills to will to do B, then one can will to\ndo B, and (ii) if one (actually) wills to avoid willing to\ndo B, then one can avoid willing to do B. Suppose, then,\nthat willing to will to do an action is just willing to do that\naction, and willing to avoid willing to do an action is just not\nwilling to do that action. In that case, one is free with respect to\nwilling to do B if and only if (i) if one (actually) wills to\ndo B, then one can will to do B, and (ii) if one\n(actually) avoids willing to do B, then one can avoid willing\nto do B. Given that actuality obviously entails possibility, it\nfollows that (i) and (ii) are both obviously true. This is one\nexplanation for why Locke might think that the question of whether one\nis free with respect to willing to do B reduces to an absurd\nquestion, the answer to which is obviously in the affirmative. It may\nbe for this reason that Locke says that the question is one that\n\u201cneeds no answer\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.25: 247).\nLocke goes on to say, at the end of II.xxi.25, that\nthey, who can make a Question of it [i.e., of\nthe second question], must suppose one Will to determine the Acts of\nanother, and another to determinate that; and so on in\ninfinitum. (E1\u20135 II.xxi.25: 247)\nIt is unclear what Locke means by this. One possibility, consistent\nwith the majority interpretation that Locke provides a negative answer\nto the second question, is that Locke is providing an argument here\nfor the claim that the proposition that it is possible to be free with\nrespect to willing to do an action leads to a vicious infinite regress\nof wills. The thought here is that being free with respect to willing\nto do an action, on Locke\u2019s theory, requires being able to will\nto do an action if one wills to will to do it; that being free with\nrespect to willing to will to do an action then requires being able to\nwill to will to do it if one wills to will to will to do it; and so\non, ad infinitum. But another possible interpretation,\nconsistent with the minority interpretation that Locke provides an\naffirmative answer to the second question, is that Locke\u2019s\nargument here is not meant to target those who answer the question\naffirmatively, but is rather designed to target those who would\n\u201cmake a question\u201d of the second question, i.e., those who\nthink that the answer to the second question is unobvious,\nand worth disputing. These people are the ones who think that willing\nto will to do A does not reduce to willing to do A, and\nthat willing to avoid willing to do A does not reduce to\navoiding willing to do A. These are the people who are\ncommitted to the existence of an infinite regress of wills, each\ndetermining the volitions of its successor. According to Locke, who\naccepts the reductions, the infinite regress of wills can\u2019t get\nstarted (see Rickless 2000: 56\u201365; Garrett 2015:\n269\u2013274).\n",
