    "main_text": "Divine Immutability and Impassibility\n2. Divine Immutability and Impassibility \n\nAs mentioned above, traditional theists believe that God is immutable\n(cannot change) and impassible (cannot be affected by anything\nexternal). These ideas are related to one another, but not identical:\nif God is immutable, then God is impassible. But just because God is\nimpassible, it does not follow that God is immutable\u2014God might\nbe able to change without being affected by any external source. If\nGod is both immutable and impassible, then it seems that no\npetitionary prayers are effective. \n\nA number of responses are open to traditional theists at this point.\nSome theists have argued that there are independent reasons for saying\nthat God is neither immutable nor impassible. For example, many people\nhave argued that God is both compassionate and forgiving. But to be\ncompassionate or forgiving seems to require being responsive to the\nactions of others, so perhaps we should not say that God is immutable\nor impassible after all (see the entry on\n God and other ultimates).\n \n\nA different response to the puzzle here would involve characterizing\nthe concepts of divine immutability and impassibility so that they\napply to God in a way that does not rule out the effectiveness of\npetitionary prayers. This is an interesting philosophical project in\nits own right (see the discussions in Creel 1985 and the entries on\n God and other ultimates\n and\n immutability),\n but its prospects for success fall beyond the scope of this\narticle.\n\nFinally, a third response would involve claiming that in cases of\napparently effective prayer, God is not really responding to the\nprayer but instead bringing about events as part of a providential\nplan, a plan that includes both the prayer and the apparent answer to\nit. Such a position is suggested by the following remark from St.\nThomas Aquinas: \u201cWe pray not in order to change the divine\ndisposition but for the sake of acquiring by petitionary prayer what\nGod has disposed to be achieved by prayer (quoted and discussed at\nlength in Stump 1979).\u201d Given the way that we have characterized\neffective prayer above, though, this approach seems to deny that\npetitionary prayers are effective, so it would not solve the problem\nat hand. \n",
