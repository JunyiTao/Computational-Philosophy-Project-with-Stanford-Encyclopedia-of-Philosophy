    "main_text": "The Ancient Accounts\n2. The Ancient Accounts\n\nThis is a distinctively modern development. Ancient philosophers and\nrhetoricians viewed metaphor as a temporary self-explanatory change in\nthe use we make of a general or singular term, typically a\nnoun or noun phrase. When we resort to metaphor, a term that routinely\nstands for one thing or kind is made to stand for another, suitably\nrelated thing or kind instead, and this change in what the term stands\nfor occurs on the fly, without warning and without special\nexplanation. The effect is to transfer the term in question\nfrom its accustomed place in our verbal classificatory scheme to some\nother unaccustomed place for special temporary expressive purposes.\nFor Aristotle, writing in the middle of the fourth century BCE, the\nfigurative redeployment of term counts as a metaphor regardless of\nprecisely how the term\u2019s usual referent and its special\ntemporary referent are related (Poetics 21 1457b ff. See also\nRhetoric 3.2 1404b-1505b, 3.4 1406b\u20131407a,\n3.10\u201311 1410b\u20131413b). By the time Quintilian and Cicero\ncome along, metaphor is one of many distinct recognized figures of\nspeech, and a self-explanatory terminological transfer counts as\nmetaphorical only if it is based on a real or supposed\nanalogy or likeness between the regular referent and\nthe special temporary one. The change matters less than one might\nexpect, since although Aristotle recognized four different kinds of\nmetaphor, he regarded the analogy-based kind as the most interesting\nby far and devoted the bulk of his discussion to it.\n\nSometimes we resort to metaphor because there\u2019s no established\nterm for the thing we want to talk about and no need to contrive a new\nterm that will refer to it once and for all. More often and more\ninterestingly, we resort to metaphor for the sake of the pleasure our\naudience will take in puzzling it out, the persona it allows us to\nadopt in addressing our audience, and the quasi-sensory vividness it\nbrings to the audience\u2019s apprehension of whatever we say with\nits help. (See Cicero, De Oratore, 55 BCE,\n3.159\u201360)\n\nAristotle portrays the understanding of one kind of metaphor as a\nstimulating exercise in analogical equation solving. Suppose\nEmpedocles employs the term \u201cold age\u201d under circumstances\nwhere it looks for all the world as if what is really being discussed\nis the course of a single day. Old age itself lacks any\nimmediate bearing on efforts to understand the course of a single day,\nso we conjecture that on this special occasion, the term \u201cold\nage\u201d stands for something with the kind of immediate bearing on\nefforts to understand the course of a single day that old\nage itself has on efforts to understand some other\nsubject matter readily called to mind by invoking old\nage\u2014namely, the course of a single human life. Just as\nold age constitutes the final stage of the course of a single life,\nwhat constitutes the final stage of the course of a single day is\nevening. Old age is to a life as evening is to a\nday. We thus infer that on this special occasion, \u201cold\nage\u201d is being employed to refer to evening, and we interpret the\nsentence in which it figures accordingly (Poetics 10\n1457b).\n\nIn working this out, we activate and begin to explore a complex and\npotentially fruitful analogy between the way a person\u2019s physical\nand intellectual powers wax and wane over the course of a single human\nlife and the way the sun\u2019s powers wax and wane over the course\nof a single day, between the way individual human lives repeat each\nother with variations in the course of an extended human lineage and\nthe way individual days do so over the course of a year, and so on.\nThe effort to recover a simple metaphorical meaning (evening) for the\nterm \u201cold age\u201d calls forth a beneficial, pleasurable,\ncomplex intellectual effort from us. The sentence we thereby come to\nunderstand may say something simple and unambitious that could easily\nbe said without resorting to metaphor, but the effort to recover this\nmeaning has a cognitive value transcending that of the meaning itself.\nSomething happens to the terms on which we access our own thoughts\nabout days and how they run: evening is set before our eyes in the\nsuggestive and instructive guise of an elderly human being. For\ndiscussion see Ricoeur (1997, 9\u201343), Lloyd (1996), Moran (1996),\nHalliwell (2003, 189\u2013191). On ancient rhetoric and poetics more\ngenerally, see the entries\n Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric\n and\n Plato on Rhetoric and Poetry\n in this encyclopedia.\n\nAs modern poetics developed out of ancient rhetoric, metaphors came to\nbe seen as meaning, communicating, or at least suggesting something\ninherently complex, open-ended, and resistant to compact literal\nstatement.\n",
