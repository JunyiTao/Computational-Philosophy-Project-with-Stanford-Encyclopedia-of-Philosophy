    "main_text": "Arguments for Meaning Holism || Direct Arguments\n2.1 Direct Arguments\n\nSome arguments for meaning holism are \u201cdirect\u201d in that\nthey provide a substantive account of what meaning is, and then argue\nthat if that is what meaning is, then meaning holism must follow. \n\nFor instance, meaning holism seems to result from radical\n use-theories[4]\n that attempt to identify meaning with some aspects of our\nuse. Examples of this could be:\n\nTheories that identify a sentence\u2019s meaning with its method\nof verification. Verificationism, combined with some plausible\nassumptions about the holism of confirmation (Hempel 1950; Quine\n1951), would seem to lead to meaning holism. \nTheories that identify a word\u2019s meaning with its inferential\nrole. Which inferences one endorses with a word depends on what one\nmeans by one\u2019s other words, and so (when combined with a\nrejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction\u2014see below) the\nweb quickly spreads to the entire language. (Block 1986, 1995; Brandom\n1994; Field 1977; Harman 1973, 1993; Sellars 1954, 1974)\nTheories that take what a person means by a word to be a\nfunctional property of that person, and assume that functional\nproperties are individuated holistically. (Block 1998; Churchland\n1979, 1986)\nTheories that identify what a person means by a word with all of\nthe beliefs that they would express using that word. (Bilgrami 1992,\n1998)\n\n\nIdentifying meaning with the beliefs associated with a word or its\ninferential/functional role leads quickly to a type of meaning holism\nbecause of the way that the connections between such beliefs and\ninferences spread through a language. For instance, a word like\n\u201csquirrel\u201d might be inferentially connected to, say,\n\u201canimal\u201d which is in turn connected to \u201cKoala\u201d\nwhich is connected to \u201cAustralia\u201d, and through similar\nchains, every word will be related inferentially to (and thus\nsemantically entangled with) every other term in the language\n(especially when one considers connections like that between, say,\n\u201cis a squirrel\u201d and \u201cis not a building\u201d or any\nother thing we take squirrels not to be). Changing the meaning of one\nword thus changes the content of at least some of the inferences and\nbeliefs that constitute the meaning of other terms in the language,\nand so a change in the meaning of one term quickly leads to a change\nin the meaning of the rest.\n\nSuch fine-grained conceptions of meaning are often motivated by the\nthought that only holistically structured meanings that were so tied\nto our beliefs or to the inferences that we were disposed to make\ncould adequately serve the purposes of psychological explanation\n(either to deal with Frege-cases (Bilgrami 1992, 1998), to match the\nfact that understanding itself is holistic (Brandom 2011: 24; Heal\n1994), or to just specify an internalistically determined\n\u201cnarrow\u201d content (Block\n 1995)).[5]\n Most such arguments crucially rely on a sub-argument with something\nlike the following general form:\n\nSome of an expression\u2019s inferential properties must be part\nof its meaning.\nIf some of an expression\u2019s inferential properties are part\nof its meaning, then they all are.\nSo, all of the inferential properties of an expression are part of\nits\n meaning.[6]\n\n\n\nSemantic atomists usually deny the first premise of this argument, and\nsemantic molecularists deny the second, and so \u201cindirect\u201d\narguments for meaning holism usually take the form of arguing against\natomism and molecularism. \n",
