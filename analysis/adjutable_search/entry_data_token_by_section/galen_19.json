    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind || The Mind\u2013Body Relation\n7.2 The Mind\u2013Body Relation\nYet it is not quite as simple as that. The physical location of the other two Platonic soul-parts, spirited and desiderative (respectively, heart and liver) are important in Galen\u2019s theory of the psuch\u0113\u2014and not just of the psuch\u0113 understood as responsible for vital functions. Galen is not able to make the same close connection, at least demonstratively (see \u00a73.1), between these other two bodily locations and their psychological functions as he is for that of the brain; nevertheless, the fact that the thumoeides\u2014a range of emotional reactions related to anger, indignation, shame, pride, anxiety, fear\u2014is located in the heart is shown by a number of examples, both from everyday experience and from traditional thought.\nGalen exemplifies and expounds this view at length in his refutation of Chrysippus in PHP II and III; such relationships between physical states and mental ones are also explored in a number of medical texts too (for a full range of such texts, and further discussion, see Singer 2017). Galen makes interestingly precise attempts at identifying physical correlates for a range of psychological or emotional states, in terms of the precise actions and states of heart or blood, e.g. fear involves a motion of the blood away from the surface of the skin, anger the opposite motion, both erotic excitement and anxiety cause significant disturbance to the pulse. Yet the texts in question are unclear on the precise nature of the causal (or identity) relationship. Relevant here too are the medical discussions in which it is clearly implied that certain types of physical state\u2014e.g., excess of melancholic humours\u2014are causative, if not constitutive, of certain mental states. At points Galen even suggests that the soul may actually be the physical substrate, in particular the blood and pneuma within the body (Symp. Caus. II.5, 191) or more specifically the pneuma within the brain (PHP VII.3, 443\u20135); he seems however ultimately to reject such a notion, preferring the formulation that the pneuma is the soul\u2019s \u201cfirst instrument for all sensations of the animal and for its voluntary motions\u201d (ibid.).\nA stronger case for a mind\u2013body identity theory in Galen, however, is provided by the discussion of the relationship between rational soul and physical features of the brain, especially in QAM. The central aim of that work is to demonstrate the extent of the influence of the body, specifically bodily mixture, on the soul; this Galen does with examples from medicine (e.g., mental derangements with physical causes) as well as everyday experience (drunkenness, effects of physical environment). How, he asks, could a soul which is not corporeal be be affected by such physical factors, and indeed be caused to leave the body as a result of certain physical conditions (QAM 3, 381)? In a number of passages, he suggests not just the dependence of the soul on bodily mixture, but the identity of the two:\n\n(a) \u201cAristotle says that the soul is form of the body \u2026 it is necessary for him to posit the mixture of these qualities [sc. of matter] as the form, so that it seems as if the substance of the soul \u2026 will be some mixture \u2026\u201d (QAM 3, 380\u20131);\n(b) \u201c \u2026 if the reasoning form of the soul is mortal, it too will be a particular mixture, namely of the brain\u201d (ibid.);\n(c)  \u201c\u2026 it is better to state \u2026 that the mortal part of the soul actually is precisely this: the mixture of the body\u201d (QAM 4, 386);\n(d)  \u201cAndronicus \u2026 says that [the soul] is either a mixture or a capacity dependent on the mixture; I disapprove of the addition of \u2018capacity\u2019 \u2026 it is not possible to say anything other than the mixture \u2026\u201d (ibid.). \n\nOn this basis, some have taken this assertion of the identity of soul and mixture as representing Galen\u2019s final position, or at least that which he finds most plausible\u00a0(see most recently Marechal 2019;\u00a0Vinkesteijn 2019). A consideration of all the relevant evidence seems to lead to a less clear-cut picture. Interpretation of QAM must take into account the polemical nature and structure of the text, which is aimed at refuting the extreme denial of bodily influence by certain \u201cself-styled Platonists\u201d, and in that context proceeds by giving as strong a statement as possible of the physicalist aspect of the theories found in a range of medical and philosophical authorites (Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics; see Lloyd 1988). More specifically, what look like the clearest identity statements ((a) and (d) above) come in dialectical contexts; it is at least arguable that Galen is here asserting the identity position not as his own but as the correct Aristotelian conclusion, on the basis of their equation of soul with form (Singer 2013, Ch. 4). (It should also be mentioned that the passages in question are not free from textual and interpretive problems.) Passages (b) and (c), meanwhile, clearly affirm the identity of the mortal parts of the soul with bodily mixtures. That, then, would be a definitive conclusion about the non-rational parts; but, within this same text, even after statement (d), Galen leaves open the Platonic possibility that the (rational) soul is a non-bodily substance. As we have seen (\u00a73.4), such indeterminacy is consistent with his explicit statements of ignorance\u2014including in texts probably later than QAM\u2014on this very question, the \u201csubstance of the soul\u201d. (Those other statements do not in fact specify that it is only the rational soul that is at issue; but, as we have seen, Galen may, somewhat confusingly, use \u201cpsuch\u0113\u201d with that narrower reference.) Other relevant evidence is the lack of clarity, in the medical texts mentioned above, as to the causal relation between mental events and physical correlates; and that some kind of interactionist picture seems implied by statements about the mutually beneficial relationship of soul and body and of their respective training (especially in San. Tu., e.g., I.8, 19\u201321). An important contribution to the discussion is Havrda 2017, arguing, on the basis of a wide range of texts, that for Galen mixture provides a sufficient causal account of all but a distinct range of goal-directed functions.\nQAM also contains a striking statement of the problem of physical determinism versus moral responsibility: how can someone properly be praised or blamed for character qualities, when these are derived not \u201cfrom himself\u201d but from bodily mixture? (QAM 11, 405). This historically distinctive formulation seems to rely on a definite and uncompromising physicalist view; again, however, the statement in this form is unique within the Galenic corpus.\nAny attempt to summarize Galen\u2019s philosophy in this area risks failing to do justice to his own plurality of formulations. Two things, at least, are uncontentious: that he makes a strong statement of the extent to which mental capacities are physically conditioned; and that he explores the subject in an empirically and physiologically informed manner unique within Graeco-Roman thought.\n",
