Geach first broached the subject of relative\nidentity and introduced the phrase \u201crelative identity\u201d.\nOver the years, Geach suggested specific instances of RI (a variant of\nthe case of Oscar and his tail is due to Geach 1980) and in this way\nhe contributed to the development of the weak view concerning relative\nidentity, i.e., the view that while ordinary identity relations are\noften relative, some are not. But Geach maintains that absolute\nidentity does not exist. What is his argument?\n\nThat is hard to say. Geach sets up two strawman candidates for\nabsolute identity, one at the beginning of his discussion and one at\nthe end, and he easily disposes of both. In between he develops an\ninteresting and influential argument to the effect that identity,\neven as formalized in the system FOL=, is relative\nidentity. However, Geach takes himself to have shown, by this\nargument, that absolute identity does not exist. At the end of his\ninitial presentation of the argument in his 1967 paper, Geach\nremarks:\n\n\nWe thought we had a criterion for a predicable\u2019s expressing\nstrict identity [i.e., as Geach says, \u201cstrict, absolute,\nunqualified identity\u201d]; but the thing has come apart in our\nhands; and no alternative rigorous criterion that could replace this\none has thus far been suggested. (Geach 1967, p. 6 [1972, p. 241])\n\n\nIt turns out, as we\u2019ll see, that all that comes apart is the\nfalse notion that in FOL= the identity symbol\ndefines the relation \\(I(A,x,y)\\). Let us examine\nGeach\u2019s line of reasoning in detail, focusing on the\npresentation in his 1967 article, the locus classicus of the\nnotion of relative identity.\n\nGeach begins by urging that a plain identity statement \u201c\\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are the same\u201d is in need of a completing predicate:\n\u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)\u201d. Frege had argued\nthat statements of number such as \u201cthis is one\u201d require a\ncompleting predicate: \u201cthis is one \\(F\\)\u201d, and so it is,\nGeach claims, with identity statements. This is a natural view for one\nwho subscribes to RI. The latter cannot even be stated without the\ncompleting predicates. Nevertheless, both the claim itself and the\nanalogy with Frege have been questioned. Some argue that the analogy\nwith Frege is incorrect. For example, Carrara and Sacchi (2007)\nmaintain that Frege\u2019s position that any ascription of a number\nto something is always relative to a concept boils down to the claim\nthat concepts are essential in cardinality statements because without\nthem there is no specification of what is to be counted. Once this is\nsettled, Frege would count by means of absolute identity. Others\nargued that while the analogy is correct, both Frege and Geach are\nwrong (Perry 1978 and Alston and Bennett 1984). These matters do not\nbear directly on the question of the coherence and truth of RI or the\nquestion of absolute identity. One who adopts the weak view would not\nwant to follow Geach on this score. And one could maintain the\n\u201ccompleting thesis\u201d without being committed to RI.\nFurthermore, the completing thesis occupies a puzzling role in\nGeach\u2019s dialectic. Immediately following his statement of the\nthesis, Geach formalizes FOL= on the basis of the single\nformula:\n\n(R)\n \\(\\phi(a) \\leftrightarrow \\exists x(\\phi(x) \\wedge x = a)\\) \n\n\n(The \u201cW\u201d is for Hao Wang, who first suggested it. The\nreader is invited to prove Ref and LL from W.) But we hear no\ncomplaint about the syntax of W despite its involving a seemingly\nunrelativized identity symbol. It turns out, however, that Geach\napparently thinks of the completing predicate as being given by the\nwhole descriptive apparatus of \\(L\\) or a fragment thereof.\n\nGeach now observes\n\n\n\u2026 if we consider a moment, we see that an I-predicable in a\ngiven theory T need not express strict, absolute,\nunqualified identity; it need mean no more than that two objects are\nindiscernible by the predicables that form the descriptive resources\nof the theory\u2014the ideology of the theory \u2026.\n(1967, p. 5 [1972, p. 240])\n\n\nHere an \u201cI-predicable\u201d is a binary relation symbol\n\u201c=\u201d satisfying (W). Geach\u2019s focus at this point is\non the need to relativize an I-predicable to a theory \\(T\\). Geach\nthen immediately saddles the friend of absolute identity with the view\nthat for \u201creal identity\u201d we need not bring in the ideology\nof a definite theory. This is Geach\u2019s first strawman. When\nlogicians, in discussing FOL=, speak of \u201creal\nidentity\u201d\u2014and they often do (see Enderton 2000 or Silver\n1994, for example)\u2014they do not mean a relation of universal\nidentity, since the universal set does not exist. Nor do they\nintend, in formulating LL, to use \u201ctrue of\u201d in a\ncompletely unrestrained way which gives rise to semantic paradox. It\nis no argument against those who wish to distinguish mere\nindiscernibility from real identity to say that they \u201cwill soon\nfall into contradictions\u201d, e.g., Grelling\u2019s or\nRussell\u2019s. The relation \\(I(A,x,y)\\) is sufficiently\nrelativized. (It is relativized to a set A.)\n\nWe come next to the main point:\n\n\nObjects that are indiscernible when we are confined to the ideology of\n\\(T\\) may perfectly well be discernible in the ideology of a theory\n\\(T^1\\) of which \\(T\\) is a fragment. (Geach 1967, p. 5 [1972, p.\n240])\n\n\nThe warrant for this claim can only be the language relativity of\nidentity when treated as a non-logical notion (see \u00a71). That this\nis what Geach has in mind is clear from some approving remarks he\nmakes in his 1973 article about Quine\u2019s (1970) proposal to treat\nidentity as a non-logical notion. But how does it follow that absolute\nidentity does not exist? Geach seems to think that the defender of\nabsolute identity will look to Ref and LL (or W)\u2014and not\nbeyond\u2014for a full account of \u201cstrict, absolute,\nunqualified\u201d identity. That is not so. The fact that these\nformulas in themselves define only indiscernibility relations is a\nlogical commonplace. So this is Geach\u2019s second strawman.\n\nIs Geach\u2019s argument at least an argument that identity is\nrelative? Does language relativity support the conclusion that RI is\ntrue even of identity as formalized in FOL=? The general\nidea appears to be that language relativity suggests that we take\nidentity to be indiscernibility, and conclude that objects\nidentical relative to one ideology \\(F\\) may be different relative to\nanother ideology \\(G\\), and that this confirms RI. Notice first of all\nthat this argument relies on the identity of indiscernibles: that\nindiscernibility implies identity. This principle is not valid in\nFOL= even when the latter is treated as a proper theory.\nLanguage relativity does not imply that the distinctness of distinct\nobjects cannot go unnoticed.\n\nSecondly, the interesting cases of RI do not involve a shift from an\nimpoverished point of view to an improved one\u2014whether this is\nseen in epistemic terms (which Geach disputes\u2014Geach 1973) or in\npurely logical terms. We do not affirm that old Oscar and young Oscar,\nfor example, are the same dog on the grounds that there is an ideology\nwith respect to which old Oscar and young Oscar are indistinguishable.\nSuch an ideology would be incapable of describing any change in Oscar.\nIt is true that the same dog relation determines a set of\npredicates that do not discriminate between the members of certain\npairs of dogs\u2014the dogs in the photographs mentioned earlier, for\nexample. And it is true that these predicates determine a sublanguage\nin which the same dog relation is a congruence, i.e., no\npredicate of the sublanguage distinguishes \\(x\\) from \\(y\\), if \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are the same dog. But the very sense of such\nstatements as that old Oscar and young Oscar are the same dog requires\na language in which a change in Oscar is expressible. We are talking,\nafter all, about old Oscar and young Oscar. If we\ntake seriously the idea that change involves the application of\nincompatible predicates, then the sublanguage cannot express the\ncontrast between old Oscar and young Oscar.\n\nThird, the phenomenon of language relativity (in the technical sense\ndiscussed in \u00a71) has led many philosophers, including Geach, to\nthe view that ideology creates ontology. There is no antecedently\ngiven domain of objects, already individuated, and waiting to be\ndescribed. Instead, theories carve up the world in various ways,\nrendering some things noticeably distinct and others indiscernible,\ndepending on a theory\u2019s descriptive resources. The very notion\nof object is theory-bound (Kraut 1980). This sort of\nanti-realism may seem to go hand in hand with relative identity. Model\ntheory, however, is realist to its core and language relativity is a\nmodel-theoretic phenomenon. It is a matter of definability (in a\nstructure). Referring back to \u00a71, in order to make sense of\nlanguage relativity we have to start with a pair of distinct\nobjects, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (distinct from the standpoint of the\nmetalanguage), and hence a pair of objects we assume are already\nindividuated. These objects, however, are indistinguishable in \\(M\\),\nsince no formula of \\(L'\\) defines a subset of \\(M\\) containing the\none object and not the other. When we move to \\(M'\\), we find that\nthere is a formula of the enriched language that defines such a subset\nin \\(M'\\). Thus, language relativity is not really any sort of\nrelativity of identity at all. We must assume that the\nobjects \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are distinct in order to describe the\nphenomenon. If we are living in \\(M\\), and suspect that Martians\nliving in \\(M'\\) can distinguish \\(a\\) from \\(b\\), our suspicion is\nnot merely to the effect that Martians carve things up differently\nthan we do. Our own model theory tells us that there is more to it\nthan that. Our suspicion must be to the effect that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nare absolutely distinct. If we are blind to the difference\nbetween \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the Martians are not, then there must be\na difference; and even if we are living in \\(M\\), we know\nthere\u2019s a difference, or at least we can suspect there is, since\nmodel theory tells us that such suspicion is well founded.\n\nLet us go back to Geach\u2019s remark that we \u201cneed\nnot\u201d interpret identity absolutely. While this is true, we\nneed not interpret it as indiscernibility either. There are always the\nquotient structures (Quine 1963). Instead of taking our\n\u201creality\u201d to be \\(M\\), and our \u201cidentity\u201d to\nbe indiscernibility in \\(M\\), we can move to the quotient structure,\n\\(\\textit{QM}\\), whose elements are the equivalence classes, \\([x]\\),\nfor \\(x\\) in \\(M\\). If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are indiscernible in \\(M\\),\nthen in \\(\\textit{QM}\\), \\([x]\\) and [\\(y\\)] are absolutely identical.\nWe can do this even if we wish to treat FOL= as a proper\ntheory. For example, suppose \\(L'\\) is a language in which people\nhaving the same income are indiscernible. The domain of \\(M\\) now\nconsists of people. \\(\\textit{QM}\\), however, consists of income\ngroups, equivalence classes of people having the same income, and\nidentity in \\(\\textit{QM}\\) is absolute. Geach objects to such\nreinterpretation in terms of the quotient structures on the grounds\nthat it increases the ontological commitments not only of \\(L'\\) but\nof any language of which \\(L'\\) is a sublanguage.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on \\(L'\\) first. From a purely model-theoretic point\nof view the question is moot. We cannot deny that \\(\\textit{QM}\\) is a\nstructure for \\(L'\\). Thus, \\(L'\\) is committed to people vis\n\u00e0 vis one structure and to income groups vis \u00e0\nvis the corresponding quotient structure. But let\u2019s pretend\nthat the structures are \u201crepresentations of reality\u201d, and\nso the question now becomes: Which representation is preferable? Is\nthere then any reason to prefer the ontology of \\(M\\) to that of\n\\(\\textit{QM}\\)? \\(M\\) contains people but no sets of people, whereas\n\\(\\textit{QM}\\) contains sets of people but no people. By\nQuine\u2019s criterion of ontological commitment\u2014that to be is\nto be the value of a variable\u2014commitment to a set of objects\ndoes not carry a commitment to its elements. That is one of the odd\nconsequences of Quine\u2019s criterion. Unless there is some\nontological reason to prefer people to sets of people (perhaps because\nsets are never to be preferred), the ontologies of \\(M\\) and\n\\(\\textit{QM}\\) seem pretty much on a par. Both commit \\(L'\\) to one\nkind of thing.\n\nGeach makes the additional claim that the ontological commitments of a\nsublanguage \\(L'\\) of a language \\(L\\) are inherited by \\(L\\) (Geach\n1973). Suppose then that \\(L\\) is a language containing expressions\nfor several equivalence relations defined on people: say, same\nincome, same surname, and same job. Geach\nargues that \\(L\\) need only be committed to the existence of people.\nThings such as income groups, job groups (equivalence classes of\npeople with the same job), and surmen can all be counted using the\nequivalencies, without bringing surmen, job groups, and income groups\ninto the picture. Consider any sublanguage for which any one of these\nequivalence relations is a congruence, i.e., for which\n\\(\\textrm{LL}'\\) holds. Pick the language, \\(L_1\\), for example, in\nwhich people having the same job are indiscernible. More precisely, we\nassume that \\(T_1\\) is the pure theory with identity whose ideology is\nconfined to the language \\(L_1\\). Let \\(M_1\\) be a model of \\(T_1\\).\nWe may imagine the domain of \\(M_1\\) to consist of people, and we can\ninterpret indiscernibility in \\(M_1\\) to be the relation x and y\nhave the same job. Geach would argue that if \\(L_1\\) is committed\nto the elements of \\(\\textit{QM}_1\\)\u2014the job groups\u2014then\nso is \\(L\\). But that is not true. If \\(T\\) is a theory of the three\ndistinct equivalence relations formulated in \\(L\\), the most \\(T\\) (or\n\\(L)\\) would be committed to are the partitions determined by the\nequivalence relations; and in any case, it would be perfectly\nconsistent to insist that, whatever the ontological commitments of\n\\(L_1\\), reality, as described by \\(L\\), consists of people.\n\nThe foregoing considerations are rather abstract. To see more clearly\nwhat is at stake, let us focus on a specific example. Geach (1967)\nmentions that rational numbers are defined set-theoretically to be\nequivalence classes of integers determined by a certain equivalence\nrelation defined on \u201cfractions\u201d, i.e., ordered pairs of\nintegers (1/2 is \\(\\langle 1,2\\rangle\\), 2/4 is \\(\\langle\n2,4\\rangle\\), etc.). He suggests that we can instead construe our\ntheory of rational numbers to be about the fractions themselves,\ntaking the I-predicable of our theory to be the following equivalence\nrelation, \\(E\\): \n\\[\\tag{R} E(\\langle x,y\\rangle, \\langle u,v\\rangle) \\text{ iff } xv = yu. \\]\n\n\nThis approach, Geach says, would have \u201cthe advantage of\nlightening a theory\u2019s set-theoretical burdens. (In our present\nexample, we need not bring in infinite sets of ordered pairs\nof integers into the theory of rationals.)\u201d (Geach 1972, p. 249)\n\n\nThe first thing to notice about this example is that E cannot\nbe the I-predicable of such a theory, since \\(E\\) is defined\nin terms of identity (look at the right side of R). It is\n\u201c=\u201d that must serve as the I-predicable, and it renders\ndistinct ordered pairs of integers discernible. The moral is that not\nall equivalence relations can be drafted to do the job of identity,\neven given a limited ideology. There is, indeed, a plausible argument\nthat any equivalence relation presupposes identity\u2014not\nnecessarily in the direct way illustrated by (R), but indirectly,\nnonetheless (see \u00a76). Moreover, from the standpoint of general\nmathematics, once we have (R), we have the (infinite) equivalence\nclasses it determines and the partition it induces. These are\ninescapable. Even from a more limited viewpoint, it seems that once we\nhave enough set theory to give us ordered pairs of integers and the\nability to define (R), we get the partition it induces as well.\n\nGeach perceives an ontological advantage in relative identity; but his\nargument is unconvincing. Shifting to the quotient structures, as\nQuine suggested, does not induce a \u201cbaroque, Meinongian\nontology\u201d (Geach 1967, p. 10 [1972, p. 245]). In particular, the\n\u201chome language\u201d \\((L)\\) does not inherit the commitment of\nthe fragment \\((L_1)\\), and the ontology of an arbitrary model of the\npure theory of identity based on the latter language is at least no\nmore various than that of the corresponding quotient model. There are,\nhowever, a number of ways in which relative identity does succeed in\navoiding commitment to certain entities required by its absolute\nrival. These are discussed in the replies to objections 4 and 5 in the\nnext section.\n",
