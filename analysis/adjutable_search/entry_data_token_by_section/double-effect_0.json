    "main_text": "Formulations of the principle of double effect\n1. Formulations of the principle of double effect\n\nThomas Aquinas is credited with introducing the principle of double\neffect in his discussion of the permissibility of self-defense in the\nSumma Theologica (II-II, Qu. 64, Art.7). Killing one\u2019s\nassailant is justified, he argues, provided one does not intend to\nkill him. In contrast, Augustine had earlier maintained that killing\nin self-defense was not permissible, arguing that \u201cprivate\nself-defense can only proceed from some degree of inordinate\nself-love.\u201d Aquinas observes that \u201cNothing hinders one act\nfrom having two effects, only one of which is intended, while the\nother is beside the intention. \u2026 Accordingly, the act of\nself-defense may have two effects: one, the saving of one\u2019s\nlife; the other, the slaying of the aggressor.\u201d As\nAquinas\u2019s discussion continues, a justification is provided that\nrests on characterizing the defensive action as a means to a goal that\nis justified: \u201cTherefore, this act, since one\u2019s intention\nis to save one\u2019s own life, is not unlawful, seeing that it is\nnatural to everything to keep itself in being as far as\npossible.\u201d However, Aquinas observes, the permissibility of\nself-defense is not unconditional: \u201cAnd yet, though proceeding\nfrom a good intention, an act may be rendered unlawful if it be out of\nproportion to the end. Wherefore, if a man in self-defense uses more\nthan necessary violence, it will be unlawful, whereas, if he repel\nforce with moderation, his defense will be lawful.\u201d\n\nThe passage can be interpreted as formulating a prohibition on\napportioning one\u2019s efforts with killing as the goal guiding\none\u2019s actions, which would lead one to act with greater\nviciousness than pursuing the goal of self-defense would require.\n\nLater versions of the double effect principle all emphasize the\ndistinction between causing a morally grave harm as a side effect of\npursuing a good end and causing a morally grave harm as a means of\npursuing a good end. We can summarize this by noting that for certain\ncategories of morally grave actions, for example, causing the death of\na human being, the principle of double effect combines the claim that\nit can be morally permissible to cause a death incidentally as a side\neffect of pursuing a good end with a general prohibition on causing\nthe death of an innocent human being for the sake of a good end. The\nprohibition is absolute in traditional Catholic applications of the\nprinciple. Two traditional formulations appear below.\n\nThe New Catholic Encyclopedia provides four conditions for\nthe application of the principle of double effect:\n\nThe act itself must be morally good or at least indifferent.\nThe agent may not positively will the bad effect but may permit\nit. If he could attain the good effect without the bad effect he\nshould do so. The bad effect is sometimes said to be indirectly\nvoluntary.\nThe good effect must flow from the action at least as immediately\n(in the order of causality, though not necessarily in the order of\ntime) as the bad effect. In other words the good effect must be\nproduced directly by the action, not by the bad effect. Otherwise the\nagent would be using a bad means to a good end, which is never\nallowed.\nThe good effect must be sufficiently desirable to compensate for\nthe allowing of the bad effect (see Connell, 1021).\n\n\nThe conditions provided by Joseph Mangan include the explicit\nrequirement that the bad effect not be intended:\n\n\nA person may licitly perform an action that he foresees will produce a\ngood effect and a bad effect provided that four conditions are\nverified at one and the same time:\n\nthat the action in itself from its very object be good or at least\nindifferent;\nthat the good effect and not the evil effect be intended;\nthat the good effect be not produced by means of the evil\neffect;\nthat there be a proportionately grave reason for permitting the\nevil effect (Mangan 1949, p. 43).\n\n\n\nIn both of these accounts, the fourth condition, the proportionality\ncondition is usually understood to involve determining if the extent\nof the harm is adequately offset by the magnitude of the proposed\nbenefit.\n\nPeter Cataldo formulates the first condition in a way that focuses on\nthe \u201cmoral object\u201d of the act:\n\n1\u2032.\nThe moral object of the act must be good or at least not be\nintrinsically immoral (Cataldo 2022, 3).\n\n\nCataldo also reports that the Catholic moral tradition provides useful\nclarification of the fourth \u201cproportionality\u201d condition by\nrecognizing five different dimensions of assessment: \u201cthe degree\nof badness of the effect; the degree of dependence of the bad effect\non the act; the proximity of the effect to the bad act; the degree of\ncertainty that the bad effect will occur; and the degree of obligation\nto prevent the bad act\u201d (Cataldo 2022, 9. fn. 12).\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that agents who regret causing harm will be\ndisposed to avoid causing the harm or to minimize how much of it they\ncause. This assumption could be made explicit as an additional\ncondition on permissibly causing unintended harm:\n\nthat agents attempt to minimize the foreseen harm and consider\nless harmful alternatives.\n\n\nMichael Walzer (1977) has convincingly argued that agents who cause\nharm as a foreseen side effect of promoting a good end must be willing\nto accept additional risk or to forego some benefit in order to\nminimize how much harm they cause. Whether harm has been minimized\nwill depend on the agent\u2019s current circumstances and the options\navailable.\n\nDouble effect might also be part of a secular and non-absolutist view\naccording to which a justification adequate for causing a certain harm\nas a side effect of pursuing a good end might not be adequate for\ncausing that harm as a means to the same good end under the same\ncircumstances.\n",
