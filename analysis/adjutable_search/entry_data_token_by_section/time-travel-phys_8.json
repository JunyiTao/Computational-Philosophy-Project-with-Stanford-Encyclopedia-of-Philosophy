Quantum Mechanics to the Rescue?\n\nWe now turn to the application of the computational approach to the\nquantum physics of time travel (see Deutsch 1991; Deutsch &\nLockwood 1994). By contrast with the earlier discussions of\nconstraints in classical systems, they claim to show that time travel\nnever imposes any constraints on the pre-time travel state of quantum\nsystems. The essence of this account is as\n follows.[7]\n\nA quantum system starts in state \\(S_1\\), interacts with its older\nself, after the interaction is in state \\(S_2\\), time travels while\ndeveloping into state \\(S_3\\), then interacts with its younger self,\nand ends in state \\(S_4\\) (see\n figure 10).\n\n\n\nFigure 10 [An\n extended description of figure 10\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nDeutsch assumes that the set of possible states of this system are the\nmixed states, i.e., are represented by the density matrices over the\nHilbert space of that system. Deutsch then shows that for any initial\nstate \\(S_1\\), any unitary interaction between the older and younger\nself, and any unitary development during time travel, there is a\nconsistent solution, i.e., there is at least one pair of states\n\\(S_2\\) and \\(S_3\\) such that when \\(S_1\\) interacts with \\(S_3\\) it\nwill change to state \\(S_2\\) and \\(S_2\\) will then develop into\n\\(S_3\\). The states \\(S_2, S_3\\) and \\(S_4\\) will typically be not be\npure states, i.e., will be non-trivial mixed states, even if \\(S_1\\)\nis pure. In order to understand how this leads to interpretational\nproblems let us give an example. Consider a system that has a two\ndimensional Hilbert space with as a basis the states \\(\\vc{+}\\) and\n\\(\\vc{-}\\). Let us suppose that when state \\(\\vc{+}\\) of the young\nsystem encounters state \\(\\vc{+}\\) of the older system, they interact\nand the young system develops into state \\(\\vc{-}\\) and the old system\nremains in state \\(\\vc{+}\\). In obvious notation: \n\n\\[\\vc{+}_1 \\vc{+}_3 \\text{ develops into } \\vc{-}_2 \\vc{+}_4.\\]\n\n\nSimilarly, suppose that:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\vc{+}_1 \\vc{-}_3 \\text{ develops into } \\vc{+}_2 \\vc{-}_4, \\\\\n&\\vc{-}_1 \\vc{+}_3 \\text{ develops into } \\vc{-}_2 \\vc{-}_4, \\text{ and} \\\\\n&\\vc{-}_1 \\vc{-}_3 \\text{ develops into } \\vc{+}_2 \\vc{+}_4.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nLet us furthermore assume that there is no development of the state of\nthe system during time travel, i.e., that \\(\\vc{+}_2\\) develops into\n\\(\\vc{+}_3\\), and that \\(\\vc{-}_2\\) develops into \\(\\vc{-}_3\\).\n\nNow, if the only possible states of the system were \\(\\vc{+}\\) and\n\\(\\vc{-}\\) (i.e., if there were no superpositions or mixtures of these\nstates), then there is a constraint on initial states: initial state\n\\(\\vc{+}_1\\) is impossible. For if \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) interacts with\n\\(\\vc{+}_3\\) then it will develop into \\(\\vc{-}_2\\), which, during\ntime travel, will develop into \\(\\vc{-}_3\\), which inconsistent with\nthe assumed state \\(\\vc{+}_3\\). Similarly if \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) interacts\nwith \\(\\vc{-}_3\\) it will develop into \\(\\vc{+}_2\\), which will then\ndevelop into \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) which is also inconsistent. Thus the system\ncan not start in state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\).\n\nBut, says Deutsch, in quantum mechanics such a system can also be in\nany mixture of the states \\(\\vc{+}\\) and \\(\\vc{-}\\). Suppose that the\nolder system, prior to the interaction, is in a state \\(S_3\\) which is\nan equal mixture of 50% \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) and 50% \\(\\vc{-}_3\\). Then the\nyounger system during the interaction will develop into a mixture of\n50% \\(\\vc{+}_2\\) and 50% \\(\\vc{-}_2\\), which will then develop into a\nmixture of 50% \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) and 50% \\(\\vc{-}_3\\), which is consistent!\nMore generally Deutsch uses a fixed point theorem to show that no\nmatter what the unitary development during interaction is, and no\nmatter what the unitary development during time travel is, for any\nstate \\(S_1\\) there is always a state \\(S_3\\) (which typically is not\na pure state) which causes \\(S_1\\) to develop into a state \\(S_2\\)\nwhich develops into that state \\(S_3\\). Thus quantum mechanics comes\nto the rescue: it shows in all generality that no constraints on\ninitial states are needed!\n\nOne might wonder why Deutsch appeals to mixed states: will\nsuperpositions of states \\(\\vc{+}\\) and \\(\\vc{-}\\) not suffice?\nUnfortunately such an idea does not work. Suppose again that the\ninitial state is \\(\\vc{+}_1\\). One might suggest that that if state\n\\(S_3\\) is \n\\[\\sqt \\vc{+}_3 + \\sqt \\vc{-}_3\\]\n\n\none will obtain a consistent development. For one might think that\nwhen initial state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) encounters the superposition\n\n\\[\\sqt\\vc{+}_3 + \\sqt\\vc{-}_3,\\]\n\n\nit will develop into superposition \n\\[\\sqt\\vc{+}_2 + \\sqt\\vc{-}_2,\\]\n\n\nand that this in turn will develop into \n\\[\\sqt\\vc{+}_3 + \\sqt\\vc{-}_3,\\]\n\n\nas desired. However this is not correct. For initial state\n\\(\\vc{+}_1\\) when it encounters \n\\[\\sqt\\vc{+}_3 + \\sqt\\vc{-}_3,\\]\n\n\nwill develop into the entangled state \n\\[\\sqt\\vc{-}_2\\vc{+}_4 + \\sqt\\vc{+}_2\\vc{-}_4.\\]\n\n\nIn so far as one can speak of the state of the young system after this\ninteraction, it is in the mixture of 50% \\(\\vc{+}_2\\) and 50%\n\\(\\vc{-}_2\\), not in the superposition \n\\[\\sqt\\vc{+}_2 + \\sqt\\vc{-}_2.\\]\n\n\nSo Deutsch does need his recourse to mixed states.\n\nThis clarification of why Deutsch needs his mixtures does however\nindicate a serious worry about the simplifications that are part of\nDeutsch\u2019s account. After the interaction the old and young\nsystem will (typically) be in an entangled state. Although for\npurposes of a measurement on one of the two systems one can say that\nthis system is in a mixed state, one can not represent the full state\nof the two systems by specifying the mixed state of each separate\npart, as there are correlations between observables of the two systems\nthat are not represented by these two mixed states, but are\nrepresented in the joint entangled state. But if there really is an\nentangled state of the old and young systems directly after the\ninteraction, how is one to represent the subsequent development of\nthis entangled state? Will the state of the younger system remain\nentangled with the state of the older system as the younger system\ntime travels and the older system moves on into the future? On what\nspace-like surfaces are we to imagine this total entangled state to\nbe? At this point it becomes clear that there is no obvious and simple\nway to extend elementary non-relativistic quantum mechanics to\nspace-times with closed time-like curves: we apparently need to\ncharacterize not just the entanglement between two systems, but\nentanglement relative to specific spacetime descriptions.\n\nHow does Deutsch avoid these complications? Deutsch assumes a mixed\nstate \\(S_3\\) of the older system prior to the interaction with the\nyounger system. He lets it interact with an arbitrary pure state\n\\(S_1\\) younger system. After this interaction there is an entangled\nstate \\(S'\\) of the two systems. Deutsch computes the mixed state\n\\(S_2\\) of the younger system which is implied by this entangled state\n\\(S'\\). His demand for consistency then is just that this mixed state\n\\(S_2\\) develops into the mixed state \\(S_3\\). Now it is not at all\nclear that this is a legitimate way to simplify the problem of time\ntravel in quantum mechanics. But even if we grant him this\nsimplification there is a problem: how are we to understand these\nmixtures?\n\nIf we take an ignorance interpretation of mixtures we run into\ntrouble. For suppose that we assume that in each individual case each\nolder system is either in state \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) or in state \\(\\vc{-}_3\\)\nprior to the interaction. Then we regain our paradox. Deutsch instead\nrecommends the following, many worlds, picture of mixtures. Suppose we\nstart with state \\(\\vc{+}_1\\) in all worlds. In some of the many\nworlds the older system will be in the \\(\\vc{+}_3\\) state, let us call\nthem A-worlds, and in some worlds, B-worlds, it will\nbe in the \\(\\vc{-}_3\\) state. Thus in A-worlds after\ninteraction we will have state \\(\\vc{-}_2\\) , and in B-worlds\nwe will have state \\(\\vc{+}_2\\). During time travel the \\(\\vc{-}_2\\)\nstate will remain the same, i.e., turn into state \\(\\vc{-}_3\\), but\nthe systems in question will travel from A-worlds to\nB-worlds. Similarly the \\(\\vc{+}\\) \\(_2\\) states will travel\nfrom the B-worlds to the A-worlds, thus preserving\nconsistency.\n\nNow whatever one thinks of the merits of many worlds interpretations,\nand of this understanding of it applied to mixtures, in the end one\ndoes not obtain genuine time travel in Deutsch\u2019s account. The\nsystems in question travel from one time in one world to another time\nin another world, but no system travels to an earlier time in the same\nworld. (This is so at least in the normal sense of the word\n\u201cworld\u201d, the sense that one means when, for instance, one\nsays \u201cthere was, and will be, only one Elvis Presley in this\nworld.\u201d) Thus, even if it were a reasonable view, it is not\nquite as interesting as it may have initially seemed. (See Wallace\n2012 for a more sympathetic treatment, that explores several further\nimplications of accepting time travel in conjunction with the many\nworlds interpretation.)\n\nWe close by acknowledging that Deutsch\u2019s starting\npoint\u2014the claim that this computational model captures the\nessential features of quantum systems in a spacetime with\nCTCs\u2014has been the subject of some debate. Several physicists\nhave pursued a quite different treatment of evolution of quantum\nsystems through CTC\u2019s, based on considering the\n\u201cpost-selected\u201d state (see Lloyd et al. 2011). Their\nmotivations for implementing the consistency condition in terms of the\npost-selected state reflects a different stance towards quantum\nfoundations. A different line of argument aims to determine whether\nDeutsch\u2019s treatment holds as an appropriate limiting case of a\nmore rigorous treatment, such as quantum field theory in curved\nspacetimes. For example, Verch (2020) establishes several results\nchallenging the assumption that Deutsch\u2019s treatment is tied to\nthe presence of CTC\u2019s, or that it is compatible with the\nentanglement structure of quantum fields.\n",
