Influence\n\nBefore the publication of Dumont\u2019s edition of the\nTrait\u00e9s de l\u00e9gislation in 1802, Bentham\u2019s\nwritings had a very limited distribution. During the revolutionary\nyears in France, Dumont fed his ideas into the debates over judicial,\nlegal, penal and legislative reform, and if his proposals had little\nimpact on the social and political improvements undertaken they yet\ncontributed to the direction of French liberalism (Champs 2015). With\nthe publication of the Trait\u00e9s de l\u00e9gislation\nBentham\u2019s stock as a legal philosopher increased dramatically.\n3000 copies of the Trait\u00e9s were sold almost\nimmediately (1838\u201343, I, 388), the Emperor Alexander ordered a\nRussian translation, and this was followed by translations (or partial\ntranslations) into Spanish, German, Polish, Portuguese and Hungarian,\nwith particularly impressive sales in Spain, Portugal, and Latin\nAmerica (1838\u201343, XI, 33, 88; see Avila-Martel 1981; McKennon\n1981; Lu\u00f1o 1981). The 1820 edition of the\nTrait\u00e9s lists nineteen booksellers in eleven European\ncountries from whom the book could be purchased. It was from this\nplatform that Bentham was able to promote himself as a potential\ncodifier of the laws in countries near and far. Despite the herculean\nefforts of Dumont, however, his ideas received a mixed reception in\nFrance (see Champs 2015, Ch.15). The aging Andr\u00e9 Morellet was\nkeen to see the principles of utilitarian legal philosophy implemented\nin French law and administration, and Marc-Antoine Jullien and\nJean-Baptiste Say among others appealed to Bentham in their attempt to\nground political economy on scientific principles. On the other hand,\nself-interest and the utility principle was rejected by Germaine de\nStael as an impoverished grounding for moral duty, and rejected by\nother reformers such as Benjamin Constant who grounded their\nliberalism on natural rights.\n\nBentham\u2019s ideas began circulating in Spain in 1810 through the\nLondon-based El Espa\u00f1ol (Dinwiddy 1984, 20), but\ninterest increased during the liberal triennium of 1820\u201323. In\n1820, Toribio N\u00fa\u00f1ez published a two-volume account of\nutilitarian legal philosophy based on the\nTrait\u00e9s\u2014titled Espiritu de Bentham\n\u00f3 sist\u00e9ma de la ciencia social, ideado por\nJerem\u00edas Bentham\u2014and his own writings on moral and\npolitical philosophy were greatly influenced by Bentham\u2019s ideas.\nIn 1821\u201322, Ram\u00f3n de Salas produced the first Spanish\ntranslation of the Trait\u00e9s in five volumes, which\nreceived a scathing critique by Jos\u00e9 Vidal, a Dominican\ntheologian at the University of Valencia, who condemned the work as an\nencouragement to revolution (Or\u00edgen de los errores\nrevolucionarios de Europe, y su remedio 1827). Earlier, in 1793,\nBentham had counselled the French National Convention to divest itself\nof its colonies on the grounds of their disutility (though the text\nEmancipate Your Colonies! was only published in 1830; Bentham\n2002, 289\u2013315). In the 1820s he directed his arguments towards\nSpain in \u201cRid Yourselves of Ultramaria\u201d and\n\u201cEmancipation Spanish\u201d (1995, 3\u2013276), and was\ngratified to see his ideas gaining traction in its former colonies in\nLatin America.\n\nAndr\u00e9s Bello used Salas\u2019 translation as the basic text\nfor his law lectures at the Colegio de Santiago in Chile, as did Pedro\nAlc\u00e1ntra de Somellera, Professor of Civil Law at the University\nof Buenos Aires. In 1825 Francisco de Paula Santander, the\nVice-President of Gran Colombia, decreed that the work be required\nreading for all law students in the vast territories of the new\nrepublic, but in 1828 its President Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the\nlegendary \u201cLiberator\u201d, after previously embracing the\nprinciples and purpose of Bentham\u2019s legal philosophy, bowed to\nclerical pressure and banned its teaching as detrimental to religion,\nmorality, and social order (1838\u201343, X, 552\u201354).\nSantander, who was more inclined to resist the influence of the\nCatholic Church, restored it to the curriculum of the universities\nwhen he became President of the newly constituted state of Colombia in\n1832.\n\nFollowing the Greek revolution against Ottoman rule, the historian and\nlegal scholar Anastasios Polyzoides, who had a hand in drafting its\nnew constitution in 1822, translated an extract on\n\u201cpublicity\u201d from Dumont\u2019s Tactiques des\nassembl\u00e9e legislatives for a Missolonghi newspaper in\n1824, promoting transparency in legislative proceedings and in\ngovernment more broadly. A year later he published in Greek A\nGeneral Theory of Administrative Systems and especially of the\nParliamentary One, Accompanied by a Short Treatise on Justices of the\nPeace and Juries in England (1825), containing a defense of\nrepresentative government and advocating a judicial system based on\nutilitarian principles, replete with references to Bentham (Peonidis\n2009).\n\nIn the United States, the dissemination of utilitarianism was\ninitially hampered by the absence of an English translation of the\nTrait\u00e9s, but there too Bentham\u2019s influence was\nnot long in being felt. David Hoffman first introduced utilitarian\nideas into legal education in America at the University of Maryland in\nthe early 1820s. John Neal, who studied law under Hoffman\u2019s\nguidance, described Hoffman as one of Bentham\u2019s \u201cmost\nenthusiastic admirers\u201d (Neal 1830, 300). In his bibliographic\nA Course of Legal Study (1817), Hoffman recommended students\nread parts of Dumont\u2019s redaction of Bentham, Th\u00e9orie\ndes peines et des r\u00e9compenses (2 vols., 1811), and it was\nHoffman who encouraged Neal to translate the Trait\u00e9s\ninto English, a task he began during the eighteen months he stayed\nwith Bentham in London in 1825\u201326. In the event, only the\nintroductory sections of the Trait\u00e9s appeared in\nNeal\u2019s Principles of Legislation (1830), parts of which\nhad first appeared in a series of articles in The Yankee, a\njournal he edited under the banner heading \u201cthe greatest\nhappiness of the greatest number\u201d.\n\nIt was Richard Smith, a government tax officer and one of\nBentham\u2019s young London disciples, who eventually translated the\ncivil and penal law parts of the Trait\u00e9s into English\nfor the The Works of Jeremy Bentham in 1838 (1838\u201343,\nI, 297\u2013580). While Smith was at work in England, the historian\nand anti-slave propagandist Richard Hildreth, Bentham\u2019s foremost\nAmerican disciple, was busy translating the same material on the other\nside of the Atlantic, convinced that the widespread interest in legal\nreform in the United States would benefit greatly from utilitarian\nideas. The reviews of Hildreth\u2019s translation praised\nBentham\u2019s legal philosophy while objecting to its underlying\nmoral assumptions and disdain for religion, a position frequently\nadopted by early critics\u2014even Hildreth took this less than\nconsistent view (1840 [1864], I, iii). The reviews paid particular\nattention to the systematic presentation of the theory of civil law,\nwhich also impressed itself on the teaching of law in the newly\nindependent states of South America, where property rights were a\nmatter of considerable importance in the aftermath of the collapse of\nthe Spanish and Portuguese empires.\n\nHildreth, whose own Theory of Morals (1844) drew\nsubstantially on the Trait\u00e9s, was correct in thinking\nthat law reformers in the United States would find sustenance in\nBentham\u2019s critical jurisprudence. Thomas Cooper, who left\nEngland for the United States in 1794 with Joseph Priestley, from whom\nhe initially derived his utilitarianism, was a confirmed Benthamite by\nthe 1820s and the intended recipient of writings Bentham entrusted to\nJohn Quincy Adams. Thereafter Cooper employed utilitarian principles\nin his writings on law and political economy, most notably in the\nLectures on the Elements of Political Economy (1826), based\non the lectures he gave at South Carolina College in Columbia, the\nfirst course of lectures on the subject in America. Edward Livingston,\nthe famous author of codes of law for Louisiana, corresponded with\nBentham, who sent him books for his research. Livingston acknowledged\nit was his reading of the Trait\u00e9s which\n\u201cfortified me in a design to prosecute the subject\u201d of a\ncode of penal law (1838\u201343, XI, 51). In its final comprehensive\nand systematic version, Livingston\u2019s System of Penal\nLaw (1833) was celebrated by many continental jurists and became\nthe centrepiece of the codification campaign in the United\nStates\u2014a campaign Bentham had attempted to launch himself some\nyears earlier by directing copies of his Papers Relative to\nCodification and Public Instruction (1817) to a number of\nwell-placed American politicians. The freethinker Gilbert Vale used\nhis position as editor of the radical periodical The Diamond\n(1840\u201342)\u2014like The Yankee, published with the\nbanner heading \u201cthe greatest happiness of the greatest\nnumber\u201d\u2014to disseminate Bentham\u2019s criticisms of the\nvagaries, chicanery, and technicalities of the law. Inspired by\nBentham, Vale was in favour of humane penal laws that proportioned\npenalties to the objective of deterrence and an advocate of state\nintervention to alter the social circumstances that fostered crime.\nJohn O\u2019Sullivan, the quixotic editor of the United States\nMagazine and Democratic Review, wrote sympathetic reviews of\nBentham, Livingston, and Hildreth, and followed them in advocating\nutilitarian law reform, particularly the abolition of the death\npenalty. Bentham\u2019s influence on these figures is discussed in\ndetail in Crimmins (2022).\n\nBentham\u2019s influence continued throughout the century in America,\nwhere the Trait\u00e9s paved the way for the reception of\nother editions and versions of his writings, which in turn led to\nsympathetic responses to the more amenable forms of utilitarian moral\nand legal theory offered by John Austin, J. S. Mill, and Henry\nSidgwick. On the other hand, Bentham\u2019s\npolitical prescriptions made little impact in the United\nStates, which was, by comparison to aristocratic England, already an\nadvanced democracy. If the utilitarian Constitutional Code\nwas directed \u201cfor the use of all nations and all governments\nprofessing liberal opinions\u201d, as its title page declared, the\npolitical positions it embraced were recommended, in the first\ninstance, for adoption at home.\n\nFor all Bentham\u2019s success abroad, in the early years of the\nnineteenth century he was little known in his own country. The April\n1804 issue of the Edinburgh Review announced his arrival on\nthe British stage in a substantial critical review of Dumont\u2019s\nTrait\u00e9s, though his main appeal was initially confined\nto a small band of law reformers determined to tackle the antiquated\nand notoriously harsh punishments meted out by English penal law. In\nthe years following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, however, when\ncalls for legal, social, and political reform were becoming\ncommonplace, Bentham\u2019s reputation in Britain was transformed\nfrom that of an eccentric and often misunderstood oracle on the\nperiphery of the intellectual and political world to that of a\nvenerable sage situated at the center of a broad reform movement.\nThroughout the following century his influence continued to be felt,\nparticularly in discussions of moral and legal philosophy and economic\ntheory and practice.\n\nJohn Austin became acquainted with Bentham\u2019s utilitarian legal\nphilosophy during his undergraduate years at Cambridge. In 1821 he was\nhired to tutor J.S. Mill in Roman law, began attending meetings of the\nUtilitarian Society established by the younger Mill in 1823, and in\n1826 was appointed to the Chair of Jurisprudence at the newly founded\nUniversity of London, where he was the first in England to introduce\nutilitarian ideas into legal education. Building on Bentham\u2019s\nscience of legislation, Austin imported its leading ideas into his own\njurisprudence, none more so than Bentham\u2019s distinction between\nthe law as it is and the law as it ought to be, an\nidea that stands at the foundation of the doctrine of legal positivism\n(1977, 397). With the posthumous publication of Lectures on\nJurisprudence or The Philosophy of Positive Law (1863),\nAustin\u2019s legal philosophy was to have a major impact on English\nand American jurisprudence\u2014in the latter context his\nconceptualization of the nature of sovereignty proved especially\ninfluential.\n\nBentham\u2019s most important influence was on John Stuart Mill. In\nhis Autobiography (1873) Mill relates that when he first\nencountered Bentham\u2019s ideas in the Trait\u00e9s\n\u201cI now had opinions, a creed, a doctrine, a philosophy; in one\namong the best senses of the word, a religion; the inculcation and\ndiffusion of which could be made the principal outward purpose of a\nlife\u201d (1963\u201391, I, 67\u201368). It was in the flush of\nhis early commitment to utilitarianism that Mill edited the five\nvolumes of Bentham\u2019s writings on evidence, Rationale of\nJudicial Evidence (1838\u201343, VI, 189\u2013585, VII\n1\u2013644). Around this time, however, partly in response to the\nchallenge of T. B. Macaulay\u2019s criticism of his father\u2019s\n\u201cOn Government\u201d and partly the result of his own\nreflections on his intellectual inheritance, Mill developed a revised\nversion of utilitarian theory. This revisionism was first announced to\nthe world in the essay \u201cBentham\u201d (1838) and received\ndefinitive expression in Utilitarianism (1861), in which he\nintroduced the notion of higher pleasures. Though, like Bentham, an\nadvocate of representative democracy based on universal suffrage, Mill\nalso made several proposals to temper the potential excesses of\nunconstrained majoritarian institutions. In other respects, including\nhis defence of individual freedom and individuality in On\nLiberty (1859), Mill\u2019s utilitarianism remained within the\nBenthamic framework.\n\nBentham\u2019s influence has been felt to a considerable extent in\nthe field of economics, in which the felicific calculus provided the\ngroundwork for the development of policy based on cost-benefit\nanalysis. As we have seen, he shared Adam Smith\u2019s view that the\nroute to a nation\u2019s prosperity is by individuals pursuing their\ninterests in ways of their own choosing, with government intervention\nlimited accordingly. However, he also developed the theory of\ndiminishing marginal utility, furnishing the legislator with a\nconceptual tool by which to address the uneven distribution of social\nhappiness. The collectivist conclusions Bentham drew from this\nprinciple were modest in scope, but later reformist economists like W.\nS. Jevons (1871), impressed by the idea that social utility could be\ncalculated based on the aggregate of individual interests, developed\nthe theory in the direction of modern welfare economics. F. Y.\nEdgeworth (1881) thought Bentham\u2019s formula of the\n\u201cgreatest happiness of the greatest number\u201d a mathematical\nabsurdity, and reformulated the goal in terms of the greatest total\nhappiness (or greatest average happiness for a fixed number of\npeople). The Fabian socialist Sidney Webb also applied utilitarian\nideas to maximize and better distribute \u201ctotal\nutility\u201d\u2014Webb\u2019s wife Beatrice once described Bentham\nas her husband\u2019s \u201cintellectual godfather\u201d (Mack\n1955). Graham Wallas, another of the Fabians, was deeply impressed by\nBentham\u2019s legal, political and administrative innovations and\nhailed him as \u201cBritain\u2019s greatest political\ninventor\u201d (Wallas 1926).\n\nOn the other side of the ledger we find the libertarian Herbert\nSpencer who deployed the utility principle in Man versus the\nState (1884) and other writings to underwrite the liberty of the\nindividual, defend the existing social order, and attack the drift\ntowards socialism and \u201cslavery\u201d. James Fitzjames Stephen,\nHenry Sidgwick, and A.V. Dicey all advocated versions of utilitarian\nindividualism, although Sidgwick occasionally gave voice to\n\u201csocialist\u201d sentiments in developing his\nintuitional utilitarian theory in The Methods of\nEthics (1874). Reform-minded liberals such as J.A. Hobson and\nL.T. Hobhouse viewed themselves as \u201cnew\u201d utilitarians,\nfinding in the protean nature of utilitarianism a justification for\ndistinctly non-individualist policies. Thus Hobhouse in\nLiberalism (1911) incorporated utilitarianism into a new\nliberal discourse that, in addition to laissez-faire\neconomics (and notwithstanding Herbert Samuel\u2019s quasi-Benthamic\nmotto \u201cthe greatest liberty of the greatest number\u201d) also\nincluded elements of socialism, social Darwinianism, and the reformist\nidealism of T. H. Green.\n",
