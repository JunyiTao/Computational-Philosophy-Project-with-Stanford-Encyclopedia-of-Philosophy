    "main_text": "An Argument for Global Atheism?\n5. An Argument for Global Atheism?\n\nAlmost all well-known arguments for atheism are arguments for a\nparticular version of local atheism. One possible exception to this\nrule is an argument recently made popular by some New Atheists,\nalthough it was not invented by them. Gary Gutting (2013) calls this\nargument the \u201cno arguments argument\u201d for atheism:\n\n\n(1)The\nabsence of good reasons to believe that God exists is itself a good\nreason to believe that God does not exist. \n\n\n(2)There is\nno good reason to believe that God exists. \n It follows from (1) and (2) that\n\n\n(3)There is\ngood reason to believe that God does not exist. \n\n\n\nNotice the obvious relevance of this argument to agnosticism.\nAccording to one prominent member of the agnosticism family, we have\nno good reason to believe that God exists and no good reason to\nbelieve that God does not exist. Clearly, if the first premise of this\nargument is true, then this version of agnosticism must be false.\n\nCan the no arguments argument be construed as an argument for global\natheism? One might object that it is not, strictly speaking, an\nargument for any sort of atheism since its conclusion is not that\natheism is true but instead that there is good reason to believe that\natheism is true. But that is just a quibble. Ultimately, whether this\nargument can be used to defend global atheism depends on how its first\npremise is defended.\n\nThe usual way of defending it is to derive it from some general\nprinciple according to which lacking grounds for claims of a certain\nsort is good reason to reject those claims. The restriction of this\nprinciple to claims \u201cof a certain sort\u201d is crucial, since\nthe principle that the absence of grounds for a claim is in all cases\na good reason to believe that the claim is false is rather obviously\nfalse. One might, for example, lack grounds for believing that the\nnext time one flips a coin it will come up heads, but that is not a\ngood reason to believe that it won\u2019t come up heads.\n\nA more promising approach restricts the principle to existence claims,\nthereby turning it into a version of Ockham\u2019s razor. According\nto this version of the principle, the absence of grounds supporting a\npositive existential statement (like \u201cGod\nexists\u201d\u2014however \u201cGod\u201d is understood) is a good\nreason to believe that the statement is false (McLaughlin 1984). One\nobjection to this principle is that not every sort of thing is such\nthat, if it existed, then we would likely have good reason to believe\nthat it exists. Consider, for example, intelligent life in distant\ngalaxies (cf. Morris 1985).\n\nPerhaps, however, an even more narrowly restricted principle would do\nthe trick: whenever the assumption that a positive existential claim\nis true would lead one to expect to have grounds for its truth, the\nabsence of such grounds is a good reason to believe that the claim is\nfalse. It might then be argued that (i) a God would be likely to\nprovide us with convincing evidence of Her existence and so (ii) the\nabsence of such evidence is a good reason to believe that God does not\nexist. This transforms the no arguments argument into an argument from\ndivine hiddenness. It also transforms it into at best an argument for\nlocal atheism, since even if the God of, say, classical theism would\nnot hide, not all legitimate God-concepts are such that a being\ninstantiating that concept would be likely to provide us with\nconvincing evidence of its existence.\n",
