    "main_text": "Zermelo Set Theory and Its Refinements || Weak variations and theories with hypersets\n4.4 Weak variations and theories with hypersets\n\nSome weaker subsystems of ZFC are used. Zermelo set theory,\nthe system Z described above, is still studied. The further\nrestriction of the axiom of separation to formulas in which all\nquantifiers are bounded in sets \\((\\Delta_0\\) separation) yields\n\u201cbounded Zermelo set theory\u201d or \u201cMac Lane set\ntheory\u201d, so called because it has been advocated as a foundation\nfor mathematics by Saunders Mac Lane (1986). It is interesting to\nobserve that Mac Lane set theory is precisely equivalent in\nconsistency strength and expressive power to TST with the\nAxiom of Infinity. Z is strictly stronger than Mac Lane set\ntheory; the former theory proves the consistency of the latter. See\nMathias 2001a for an extensive discussion.\n\nThe set theory KPU (Kripke-Platek set theory with urelements,\nfor which see Barwise 1975) is of interest for technical reasons in\nmodel theory. The axioms of KPU are the weak Extensionality\nwhich allows urelements, Pairing, Union, \\(\\Delta_0\\) separation,\n\\(\\Delta_0\\) collection, and \\(\\in\\)-induction for arbitrary formulas.\nNote the absence of Power Set. The technical advantage of KPU\nis that all of its constructions are \u201cabsolute\u201d in a\nsuitable sense. This makes the theory suitable for the development of\nan extension of recursion theory to sets.\n\nThe dominance of ZFC is nowhere more evident than in the\ngreat enthusiasm and sense of a new departure found in reactions to\nthe very slight variation of this kind of set theory embodied in\nversions of ZFC without the foundation axiom. It should be\nnoted that the Foundation Axiom was not part of the original\nsystem!\n\nWe describe two theories out of a range of possible theories of\nhypersets (Zermelo-Frankel set theory without foundation). A\nsource for theories of this kind is Aczel 1988.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, we will use the term \u201cgraph\u201d\nfor a relation, and \u201cextensional graph\u201d for a relation\n\\(R\\) satisfying \n\n\\[ (\\forall y,z \\in \\textit{field}(R)[\\forall x(xRy \\equiv xRz)\n\\rightarrow y = z]. \\]\n\n\nA decoration of a graph \\(G\\) is a function \\(f\\) with the property\nthat \\(f(x) = \\{f(y) \\mid yGx\\}\\) for all \\(x\\) in the field of \\(G\\).\nIn ZFC, all well-founded relations have unique decorations,\nand non-well-founded relations have no decorations. Aczel proposed his\nAnti-Foundation Axiom: every set graph has a unique\ndecoration. Maurice Boffa considered a stronger axiom: every\npartial, injective decoration of an extensional set graph \\(G\\) whose\ndomain contains the \\(G\\)-preimages of all its elements can be\nextended to an injective decoration of all of \\(G\\).\n\nThe Aczel system is distinct from the Boffa system in having fewer\nill-founded objects. For example, the Aczel theory proves that there\nis just one object which is its own sole element, while the Boffa\ntheory provides a proper class of such objects. The Aczel system has\nbeen especially popular, and we ourselves witnessed a great deal of\nenthusiasm for this subversion of the cumulative hierarchy. We are\ndoubtless not the only ones to point this out, but we did notice and\npoint out to others that at least the Aczel theory has a perfectly\nobvious analogue of the cumulative hierarchy. If \\(A_{\\alpha}\\) is a\nrank, the successor rank \\(A_{\\alpha +1}\\) will consist of all those\nsets which can be associated with graphs \\(G\\) with a selected point\n\\(t\\) with all elements of the field of \\(G\\) taken from\n\\(A_{\\alpha}\\). The zero and limit ranks are constructed just as in\nZFC. Every set belongs to an \\(A_{\\alpha}\\) for \\(\\alpha\\)\nless than or equal to the cardinality of its transitive closure. (It\nseems harder to impose rank on the world of the Boffa theory, though\nit can be done: the proper class of self-singletons is an obvious\ndifficulty, to begin with!).\n\nIt is true (and has been the object of applications in computer\nscience) that it is useful to admit reflexive structures for some\npurposes. The kind of reflexivity permitted by Aczel\u2019s theory\nhas been useful for some such applications. However, such structures\nare modelled in well-founded set theory (using relations other than\nmembership) with hardly more difficulty, and the reflexivity admitted\nby Aczel\u2019s theory (or even by a more liberal theory like that of\nBoffa) doesn\u2019t come near the kind of non-well-foundedness found\nin genuinely alternative set theories, especially those with universal\nset. These theories are close variants of the usual theory\nZFC, caused by perturbing the last axiom to be added to this\nsystem historically (although, to be fair, the Axiom of Foundation is\nthe one which arguably defines the unique structure which the usual\nset theory is about; the anti-foundation axioms thus invite us to\ncontemplate different, even if closely related, universal\nstructures).\n",
